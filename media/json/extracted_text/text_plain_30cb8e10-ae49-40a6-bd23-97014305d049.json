The Student<br />\nCouncil president and the Education Committee chair of the<br />\nCouncil are automatically<br />\nmembers of the CUS.<br />\nSeveral members of the CUS<br />\nbelieved that the change in the<br />\ncharge was motivated in part by<br />\nthe CUS's rejection of a proposal<br />\nfrom the Deans of Engineering<br />\nlast year.<br />\nOne member of CUS felt that<br />\nthe revision of the charge was<br />\npart of a \"political game that<br />\nshould not have entered into the<br />\nprocess.\" According to Education Chair Peter Blitstein, the<br />\nCouncil resolution tells \"the<br />\nAcademic Council that we do not<br />\nthink the revised charge is<br />\nlegitimate.\"<br />\nHe objected to both the requirement that one student be an<br />\nengineer as well as to another<br />\nSee CUS, 3<br />\n<br />\nBill Berger<br />\n<br />\nFun, games, and hijinks at Spring Fair included a sponge toss.<br />\n<br />\nSpring Fair hits its stride<br />\non Sunday afternoon<br />\nby Robin Steckler<br />\nBeautiful weather on Sunday<br />\npacked the final day of Hopkins<br />\nSpring Fair making Circus '90 a<br />\nbig top success, despite precipitation, chilly temperatures and low<br />\nturnouts Friday and Saturday.<br />\nCold, rainy, sometimes snowy<br />\nweather Friday and Saturday<br />\npresented a bleak outlook for<br />\nspring Fair.

In fact, we had some<br />\npeople stop in the other night to<br />\nlook at the place. They seemed<br />\nfavorably impressed.<br />\nAh youth.<br />\nLook, I don't claim to be the<br />\nend-all be-all of knowledge in the<br />\nrenting and leasing world, but<br />\nhaving lived in three different<br />\napartments in my four years at<br />\nschool, I'd like to think that I've<br />\nacquired a few clues. I mean,<br />\nthere are things that you just don't<br />\ncount on when you look for a<br />\nplace to stay.<br />\nFor example, the fact that an<br />\napartment is empty and echoes a<br />\nlot when you look at it is no indication that it's going to hold all<br />\nyour junk. Every college student<br />\nis a direct evolutionary descendent of the packrat. We all have<br />\nstupid things that we refuse to<br />\npart with, like the neon letters we<br />\nwrenched off the sign at the Kmart near our house because they<br />\nwere our initials, or the 20'x35'<br />\nGrateful Dead industrial silk promo banner that we lifted from the<br />\nHicksville Grandstand Paladium<br />\nand Show Palace. Typically, the<br />\nfelonies resulting in said acquisitions begin with the phrase,<br />\n\"Gee, that'd look great on my<br />\nwall at school.\" The fact of the<br />\nmatter is that it will only look<br />\ngreat if you decide to move into<br />\nthe Hicksville Grandstand<br />\nPaladium and Show Palace.<br />\nCockroaches are another thing.<br />\nEvery dorm-housed freshman<br />\nclaims to know about them and<br />\nto be prepared to deal with them.<br />\nWell, let me tell you something:<br />\nwe're not talking about some silly Raid commercial cockroach<br />\nwho lifts his skirt and runs into<br />\nthe corner when the disinfectant<br />\nspray is put in his aquarium. The<br />\ncockroaches you'll have to deal<br />\nwith are the ones who used to<br />\nheat up those others at school an&<br />\nsteal their lunch money. Think<br />\n<br />\nabout this rationally\u2014I lived on<br />\nthe fifth floor of McCoy my<br />\nfreshman year. To a cockroach,<br />\nthe average stair looks about thirty or forty feet high.

I love<br />\nbeing able to roll out of bed and<br />\nonto campus. But I've mentioned the antics of the local garbage<br />\nmen in another column. I'm also<br />\nable to witness firsthand the occasional (every twenty minutes or<br />\nso) drills that the local fire department holds, since 33rd Street<br />\nseems to be the only street<br />\nstraight enough for them to drive<br />\non safely. Unfortunately, I never<br />\nget to see them test their hoses or<br />\nladders, but whoo-boy, their<br />\nsirens are in top form.<br />\nAs an added bonus, some lucky<br />\nguy across the alley from me has<br />\njust purchased a BRAND NEW<br />\n<br />\nAcademic Council should hold its horses<br />\nThe Student Council is to be commended for taking a<br />\nfirm stand against the Academic Council's proposal to<br />\nmandate a student engineering representative on the Committee for Undergraduate Studies (CUS). One of the<br />\ntrademarks of Council's approach this year has been<br />\nserious attention to the rule of law in both their own proceedings and those of the University. By insisting that<br />\nCouncil would continue to exercise its legal right to appoint student representatives to CUS, it refused to allow<br />\ntheir already severely circumscribed power to be limited<br />\nby administrative fiat. It is regretable that the Academic<br />\nCouncil has been so petulant about accepting the CUS's<br />\nconsidered objections to a BA in Engineering. In the long<br />\nrun, however, the Academic Council's impatience with<br />\ndue process, as seen in their handling of the CUS membership question, is most alarming. If student representation<br />\non University committees merely means that their presence<br />\nis welcome only so long as they are seen but not heard,<br />\nthen that is not representation at all.<br />\nThe Academic Council's next step will define the administration's relationship with its undegraduates for years<br />\nto come. It would be refreshing if the Council appreciated<br />\n<br />\nthe concerned and informed students who sit on CUS,and<br />\nattempted to work with them rather than against them.<br />\nSince this has not been the case so far, a solution to the<br />\ncurrent disagreement between the CUS, Student Council,<br />\nand the Academic Council presents itself.<br />\nNo further decisions should be made by the Academic<br />\nCouncil vis a vis undergraduate representation on CUS,<br />\nor the voting status of the Academic Advisors, until the<br />\nRichardson Administration takes command of the University in July. A serious restructuring of the University's<br />\nundergraduate division is in order, and such work should<br />\nbe a combined initiative including the students, the<br />\nAcademic Council, and Dr. Richardson.<br />\nThe Academic Council would do well to stop behaving<br />\nlike petulant parents who are finding it difficult to accept<br />\nthat their children have found their behavior to be ethically flawed. The CUS and the Academic Advisors have only the undergraduates' best interests in mind. It would be<br />\nto all of our benefits to wait until the University's leadership vacuum is filled in July before the Academic Council decides to further antagonize the undergraduates.<br />\n<br />\nThe Pre Frosh, they are a comin'<br />\nHigh school seniors will be arriving in hordes next week<br />\nto check out the Homewood campus. Just what does<br />\nHopkins have to inspire these young whippersnappers to<br />\ncome here over an Ivy or Big Ten school? As much as<br />\nwe gripe and complain from our little stone building in<br />\na ditch, the News-Letter thinks this place has quite a bit<br />\nto offer.<br />\nWhile the facade of immaculately manicured lawns and<br />\nrestored pseudo-Georgian architecture hides the financial<br />\ncrisis occurring in Arts and Sciences, it does not obscure<br />\nthe classrooms where demanding academics still reside.<br />\nThe History department is among the top five in the country, and rising quickly to national attention is the Physics<br />\nand Astronomy department. The student-faculty ratio is<br />\nalso a plus; it's still low enough to allow for a one-to-one<br />\nrelationship that is rare at other universities.<br />\nAs always stressed down here at the Gatehouse,<br />\nacademics are ndt everything, and pre-frosh will get a<br />\n<br />\nchance to savor some extracurricular activities at next<br />\nweekend's open house. One of the greatest aspects of going to Hopkins is the diversity of the student body, reflected<br />\nin the many groups on campus. There are sororities and<br />\nfraternities as well as clubs for bridge players, comic book<br />\ncollectors, ham radio operators (not to mention our humble newspaper), etc., all of which will be in the Glass<br />\nPavilion next Saturday.<br />\nAthletics are also an integral part of Hopkins life and<br />\nwe don't just mean the time-honored tradition of men's<br />\nlacrosse. (Especially this year. We do have an excellent<br />\nteam, but several other schools seem to have more excellent<br />\nones.) Men's basketball, field hockey and ice hockey went<br />\nfar beyond expectations this year and there is always room<br />\nfor improvement on the football team.<br />\nSo this week, as pre-frosh run amok, remember how<br />\nmuch this university has to offer and try not to give an<br />\nundeservedly negative impression.,<br />\n<br />\nLetters<br />\nLibrary<br />\nTo the Editor:<br />\nOn April 20th and 21st, the<br />\nMilton S.

The long<br />\nawaited billion-dollar hotel has<br />\n420 million sq. ft. resting along<br />\n17 beach-front acres. It has a<br />\n120,000 sq.-ft. casino with barrel vaulted ceilings, luscious red<br />\ncarpets, and 24 hand-carved<br />\nAustrian crystal chandeliers (at<br />\n$250,000 apiece). Room prices<br />\nvary from $250 for a normal<br />\nroom to $10,000 for the Alexander the Great suite. Though one<br />\nmight question the excessive<br />\nspending, or perhaps the authenticity of the reproduction (one<br />\nTime magazine columnist called<br />\nthe hotel the \"work of a candymaker gone mad\"), there is little doubt of Mr. Trump's ability<br />\nto write large checks.<br />\nAs if Mr. Trump's unsavory<br />\nfamily life was not enough, the<br />\nopening of the Taj Mahal this<br />\nweek has focused even more<br />\nmedia attention on the fading fortunes of America's most<br />\ncelebrated millionaire. The comments have been less than flattering. Barron's Mr. Alan Abelson<br />\ndescribed the Taj Mahal as<br />\n\"Donald Trump's latest contribution to the enrichment of Western<br />\nCivilization and Donald Trump\"<br />\nand added that \"they are not, in<br />\ncase you wondered, one and the<br />\nsame: Western Civilization is<br />\nolder.\" Mr. Abelson went on to<br />\nchronicle the sad plight of Mr.<br />\nMarvin Roffman, until last week<br />\nan entertainment industry analyst<br />\nfor the firm of Janney Montgomery Scott. It seems that Mr.<br />\nRoffman had the temerity to mention, horror of horrors, that<br />\nAtlantic City was \"an ugly and<br />\ndreary kind of place\" and that<br />\nMr. Trump might have trouble<br />\nbreaking even in a slow<br />\neconomy. These comments must<br />\nhave seriously distressed bondholders in the Taj Mahal venture,<br />\nbut they were even more distressing for Mr. Roffman. Upon<br />\nreceiving a strongly worded com-<br />\n<br />\nPUNCH, from 4<br />\nELECTRIC GUITAR. Yay! Unfortunately, the music store must<br />\nhave been plumb out of talent that<br />\nday, on account of every song he<br />\nplays sounds like this:<br />\nSCREEEEEE00WWWHHHEE<br />\n(kplang)(chunk) REE00WWW<br />\n(distortion) (wah box effects)<br />\nSCREEEEEEE (lots of vibrato)<br />\n000HHH (fade until memory<br />\nkicks in with next Hendrix song).<br />\nI have a strong suspicion that<br />\nhis fingers are permanently bent<br />\ninto fists and that he can do<br />\nnothing but bang on the poor<br />\nguitar. I would be greatly relieved if he would play one song from<br />\nbeginning to end, instead of just<br />\nthe snippets he does play.

One of the points that Dr.<br />\nDyson made was that he saw the<br />\nscientific pursuit as a rebellion<br />\nagainst the restrictions of society. Dr. Dyson stated that the best<br />\nscientists are often the most<br />\noutspoken social activists.<br />\nI find myself here at Hopkins<br />\ntrying to lead the double life of<br />\nscientist/activist and wondering if<br />\nwhat Dr. Dyson said may have<br />\nbeen true in his youth but holds<br />\nlittle bearing in today's world.<br />\nHopkins is a pool of the most<br />\ntalented people. I have met<br />\nfriends here that have the ability<br />\nand vision that leave me<br />\nspeechless. Yet, one of the few<br />\nthings I do not see here at<br />\nHopkins is a surplus of idealism.<br />\nI do not believe that Hopkins<br />\ndeserves any special blame for<br />\nthis lack of idealism. Most people today seem to put little stock<br />\n, in their ability to have any effect<br />\non the world, let alone a positive<br />\neffect. Yet, the thought of a community of people with the<br />\nresources of a universtity at their<br />\nfingertips all feeling powerless<br />\nseems absurd. If the Hopkins<br />\ncommunity cannot target injustice<br />\n<br />\nS<br />\nWHO, tie ?<br />\n<br />\nboEtt. \u2022\u2022\u2022 w\u2022i\u2022 \u2022\u2022<br />\nACTUALLY....<br />\n<br />\nMichael Falk of Amnesty Intl<br />\nin the world, who can?<br />\nIt is true, things have changed<br />\ngreatly since my days as a<br />\nfreshman. An active women's<br />\ncenter has grown to the point<br />\nwhere it can effectively rally the<br />\nHopkins community to defend<br />\nwomen's reproductive rights.<br />\nThe Students for Environmental<br />\nAction have taken root and<br />\nbecome one of the largest groups<br />\non campus, utilizing student<br />\nvolunteers to implement campuswide recycling. Plus, the Amnesty International group which I<br />\nhelped to start two years ago has<br />\nattempted to keep Hopkins aware<br />\nof the state of human rights<br />\nthroughout the world. These have<br />\njoined the Circle K which served as an effective community service group long before I arrived.<br />\nSo if things are changing for<br />\nthe better, why am I yelling this<br />\ncall to arms? Students do not<br />\nrealize the potential they have to<br />\neffect change in the world. There<br />\nwas a time when it was common<br />\nfor students to stand up for what<br />\nthey believed in. Today it seems<br />\nlike a small minority.<br />\nIf you are wondering, \"Why<br />\nshould I bother?\" I would reply<br />\nthat my work for Amnesty has<br />\nbeen the most rewarding work<br />\nI've done at Hopkins. To illustrate my point I would like to<br />\n<br />\nshare with you a piece of my<br />\ndiary dated February 10, 1990:<br />\nToday was \"Teach For<br />\nAmerica Day\" and a friend and<br />\nI had the opportunity to teach a<br />\n25-minute course to fifth graders<br />\nabout human rights. It was so<br />\nmuch fun!<br />\nFirst I asked what rights they<br />\ncould think of. The responses<br />\nvaried from \"to dress how you<br />\nwant\" and \"to say what you<br />\nwant\" to \"to go fishing\" or \"to<br />\ngo to college.\" Then we discussed how in the old days there were<br />\nkings who could say, \"You are<br />\nnot allowed to fish!\" or \"I do not<br />\nwant you wearing blue jeans ever<br />\nagain!\" So, I asked the kids how<br />\nthey would feel. Well, they said<br />\nthey would be angry.<br />\nThen we discussed, \"If a friend<br />\nof yours was being denied a right,<br />\nwhat could you do to help them?\"<br />\nIn the first class I taught, the<br />\nstudents decided they would help<br />\nthat friend leave the country, and<br />\nlet the friend stay at their house<br />\nafter getting free. in the scond<br />\nclass, they decided to write to the<br />\nking and send petitions (what<br />\nsmart kids!), but they wanted to<br />\nstay on his good side.<br />\nThen I explained that Amnesty International sends letters and<br />\nhow Amnesty tries to get many<br />\npeople to write so the king has to<br />\n<br />\nopen these letters all day that say,<br />\n\"Why can't my friend go<br />\nfishing?\" Amnesty hopes that the<br />\nking will get fed up and try to<br />\nhelp solve the problem.<br />\nI then distributed a Children's<br />\nEdition Urgent Action which we<br />\nread together. It concerned a 15<br />\nyear old in Peru who was arrested<br />\nwithout charge and in danger of<br />\nbeing hurt. I think the kids were<br />\nhappy they could read something<br />\nso important and surprised that<br />\nthis could happen. I suggested<br />\nthat they take the Urgent Action<br />\nand a copy of the Universal<br />\nDeclaration of Human Rights and<br />\ntalk about this with their parents.<br />\nMaybe some will write letters.<br />\nAfter the class someone told<br />\nme that Nelson Mandela will be<br />\nfree tomorrow.<br />\n<br />\nThe News-Letter<br />\nWelcomes its<br />\nEditorial Board<br />\n1990-1991<br />\nfor<br />\nOVERI,OADED WITH FINALS<br />\nEditors in Chief:<br />\nT.H.

Kern<br />\nCHICAGO\u2014When a reclusive<br />\nwriter crawls out of his cave and<br />\ndrops a new book into the lap of<br />\nthe public, we're supposed to<br />\nhave no questions for him. \"It's<br />\nall in the book,\" he'll say. But<br />\nwhat if the book only generates<br />\nmore questions\u2014big ones, the<br />\nkind that a professor or randparent can't resolve?<br />\nIn that case, it's probabt/ best<br />\nto go to the source, aid ask<br />\nnovelist Tim O'Brien: Wiat ex<br />\nactly is going on here? In he fne<br />\nyears since the publicaticn of hs<br />\nastonishing comic-apalypic<br />\nnovel, \"The Nuclear tge\" he<br />\nhas been chiselling cut \"The<br />\nThings They Carried\" Houghton<br />\nMifflin/Seymour Lairence), a<br />\nbook that is at once stonishingly lucid and, on anorler level, Officult to penetrate-the literary<br />\n, equivalent of bulleproof glass.<br />\nQuestions aboud, for \"The<br />\nThings They Ciried\" is an<br />\nelegant and divere collection of<br />\nshort stories that as unified and<br />\nsturdily constructed as a novel.<br />\nO'Brien claims ii an introductory<br />\nnote that the bo(k is fiction (\"except for a fewdetails regarding<br />\n, the author's ovn life\"); yet, two<br />\n1 pages later, he dedicates tlt book<br />\n; \"to the men ei Alpha company,\"<br />\nall of whom tppear as characters<br />\ni in the book<br />\n\"The Things They Caned\" is<br />\nridden with similar twists loops,<br />\nand literary figure-eghts\u2014<br />\ndevices which, despit their<br />\ncrystalline prose, leave tb reader<br />\nguessing. Are these chracters<br />\n<br />\ni<br />\n<br />\nI<br />\n<br />\n1<br />\n<br />\nM<br />\n<br />\n0<br />\n<br />\n\\<br />\n<br />\n1Green<br />\n<br />\nreal,)r the work of O'Brien's imagirgion? Which of these stories<br />\nare rue and which are invented?<br />\nIt toesn't help that the main<br />\nchracter in the book is an exceedingly articulate fellow<br />\nlimed Tim O'Brien, who, it so<br />\nVappens, is a 43-year-old writer<br />\nwho once served in Vietnam.<br />\nThose familiar with O'Brien's<br />\nprevious books, especially the incandescent \"Going After Cacciato,\" which won the 1979 National Book Award for fiction,<br />\nhave reason to wonder. Is this yet<br />\nanother \"Vietnam book?\" Or, to<br />\nput it as bluntly as some critics<br />\nhave: Is O'Brien sneaking bones<br />\nfrom the same old literary grave?<br />\nReading \"The Things They<br />\nCarried,\" arguably the best book<br />\nof O'Brien's career, these questions crumble into irrelevance.<br />\nThough the majority of the book<br />\nis set in Vietnam, this is in no<br />\nsense a mere \"book about war.\"<br />\nO'Brien is an incisive and astute<br />\nreporter of the human conscience;<br />\nthe prose in the pages of his latest<br />\n\"book\"\u2014not a novel, not a story<br />\ncollection\u2014often reads with the<br />\nclarity and conciseness of<br />\ntelegraph messages from the heart<br />\nto the mind.<br />\nThose messages, which<br />\nO'Brien has distilled from nearly twenty years of writing about<br />\nand imagining the war, form the<br />\ncenter of \"The Things They Carried,\" which is of itself a work<br />\nof the imagination, camouflaged<br />\nas fact. For O'Brien, the experieice of Vietnam has nurtured<br />\nthe reed to tell stories, to explain<br />\nand revise events until they synch<br />\n<br />\nwith his perception of them<br />\ntwenty years later.<br />\nBesides the rifles, packs, firstaid kits, marijuana, C-rations,<br />\nand occasional candy bars that the<br />\nsoldiers carry in these pages, they<br />\nalso shoulder the weight of<br />\ndreams, irrational and rational<br />\nfears, ambitions, jokes, desires,<br />\nand the need to tell stories\u2014<br />\ncommon payloads for people in<br />\nall circumstances, from all<br />\nbackgrounds.<br />\nYet it isn't O'Brien's message<br />\nthat endows \"The Things They<br />\nCarried\" with such impact; it's<br />\nhis dazzling set of variations on<br />\nthe theme. In the title story of the<br />\nbook, a lieutenant carries notquite-love letters from a girl at a<br />\ncollege in New Jersey, convinced that she would love him if he<br />\nwere back in the States. One day,<br />\nwhile he daydreams about her<br />\ntongue and her kneecaps, one of<br />\nhis men is killed. The lieutenant<br />\nblames himself for the death; the<br />\nnext day he burns the letters.<br />\nIn \"The Sweetheart of the<br />\nSong Tra Bong,\" a soldier named<br />\nRat Kiley tells his buddies a story<br />\nabout a soldier who shipped his<br />\ngirlfriend from Cincinnati into<br />\nVietnam. The girl enters the story<br />\nwearing culottes and an innocent<br />\nsmile, and she exits utterly<br />\ntransformed\u2014uninterested in her<br />\nboyfriend, chummy with a bloodthirsty group of Green Berets,<br />\nwearing a necklace made of<br />\nhuman tongues.<br />\nSome of \"The Things They<br />\nCarried\" stretches credibility;<br />\nsome of it is utterly plausible.<br />\nLike their creator, these<br />\n<br />\nI<br />\n<br />\nMachine<br />\n<br />\ncharacters are fascinated by the<br />\nlines that separate truth and fiction, and O'Brien consistently<br />\npresents them\u2014and the reader\u2014<br />\nwith hurdles of fact and invention<br />\nthat they must either duck or leap<br />\nover. This aspect of the book, as<br />\nO'Brien admitted during a recent<br />\ninterview, amounts to something<br />\nof a game between novelist and<br />\nreader.<br />\nYet these devices never appear<br />\nwithout a purpose, and for all of<br />\nthe apparent morbidity and loss<br />\nweaved throughout these stories,<br />\nthere are corresponding threads<br />\nof beauty and, perhaps most<br />\nvaluable, profound understanding.<br />\nIt's all in the book.<br />\n(This interview was conducted<br />\nMarch 15 at the Omni Ambassador East Hotel in Chicago.)<br />\nNews-Letter: What inspired you<br />\nto play such blatant and elaborate<br />\ngames with the lines between fiction and non-fiction in the book?<br />\nAt one point you talk about Rat<br />\nKiley 's methods of storytelling,<br />\nand you write that \"He told a<br />\nstory to heat up the truth, to make<br />\nit burn so hot that you couldfeel<br />\nexactly what hefelt.\"Is that what<br />\nyou were trying to do in the book?<br />\nO'Brien: That's a good, apt piece<br />\nof language to pull out of the<br />\nbook, because it has to do with<br />\nwhy the book was done as it was<br />\ndone . . .[one of my methods]<br />\nwas to invent and then call in the<br />\ntruth. In either case your purpose<br />\nis to somehow engage the reader<br />\nso the reader will feel something<br />\nof what you felt. Even though the<br />\nsurface of the events may have<br />\nnothing to do with what you felt<br />\nat all\u2014they may be entirely made<br />\nup\u2014you're trying to get at emotion and issues ofjustice or guilt<br />\nor whatever is on the table. That<br />\nchunk of language seems to me<br />\nto represent the aboutness of the<br />\nbook, in a way.<br />\nN-L: How did the book's structure evolve? There are obviously<br />\nseveral different angles you tried.<br />\n<br />\nNovelist Tim O'Brien, whose latest book deliberately deceives the reader<br />\nto get at the truth<br />\nO'Brien: [Developing a book's<br />\nstructure] always happens differently. Part of it was just<br />\nsimplicity: I wanted to write a<br />\nbook that, on the surface, could<br />\nbe read in a very simple,<br />\nstorytelling way. And the book<br />\ncan be read that way\u2014and will be<br />\nread that way\u2014by most people,<br />\nmost readers. It could be read as<br />\na memoir, I think. Which is fine;<br />\nI don't care. What I do care<br />\n[about] is that it is believed.<br />\nI wanted the book to be read<br />\nsimply, and [to be] believed on<br />\nthe surface. But underneath it,<br />\nthere were all kinds of storytelling things that I wanted to explore<br />\nsomehow. Not that I have<br />\nanything to say about these<br />\nthings; I wanted to explore them<br />\nin the stories themselves. And by<br />\nhaving an invented, 43-year-old<br />\nTim O'Brien telling about telling<br />\nstories\u2014and worrying about telling stories\u2014to engage the reader<br />\nnot just in the stories themselves,<br />\nbut in the making of stories.<br />\nHence [O'Brien's fictional<br />\ndaughter] Kathleen: 'Why are<br />\nyou so obsessed about the war?'<br />\n'I'm not obsessed,' he says. 'The<br />\nwar stuff is not what I'm obsessed by. It's all these stories.' As<br />\n<br />\na response, [I wrote part of the<br />\nlx)ok] in a dramatic setting: make<br />\nup a daughter asking a question<br />\nof the author, of Tim's character,<br />\nso that there's a dramatic setting.<br />\nPeople are talking to people about<br />\nthe book that's being read, essentially, as opposed to [my] interjecting a sort of little essay.<br />\nThat word you used was really appropriate\u2014the word<br />\n\"game.\" For me [a game] is part<br />\nof writing: it's fun.

On the main level\u2014the<br />\nway one hopes it will be read\u2014<br />\nyou'll laugh, but you'll be intrigued by a few things. One is<br />\nthe language Rat's using: he's<br />\nsaying things like, 'We've all<br />\nseen weirder shit than this.'[And<br />\nthen he says to the guys in the<br />\nstory:]'You believe a guy comes<br />\nback from the bush; he claims he<br />\nsaw the Virgin Mary riding a<br />\ngoose out there, and everybody<br />\nswallows it. They ask, How fast<br />\nwas she going'?

That is, it's an incredible<br />\nthing in a Platonic sense\u2014up<br />\nthere, [in theory], it's credible.<br />\nBut down here [in reality], when<br />\nsomeone attaches it to human beings, it somehow turns into this<br />\nincredible thing.

The<br />\n\"truth\" to which he refers throughout the book<br />\nis, put simply, emotional honesty\u2014fidelity to<br />\nthe feelings, and not necessarily the physical<br />\nfacts, ofany given situation.

After supper Rat<br />\nKiley went over and stroked its nose.<br />\nHe opened up a can of C rations, pork and<br />\nbeans, but the baby buffalo wasn't interested.<br />\nRat shrugged.<br />\nHe stepped back and shot it through the right<br />\nfront knee. The animal did not make a sound.<br />\nIt went down hard, then got up again, and Rat<br />\ntook careful aim and shot off an ear. He shot<br />\nit in the hindquarters and in the little hump at<br />\nits back. He shot it twice in the flanks. It wasn't<br />\nto kill; it was to hurt. He put the rifle muzzle<br />\nup to its mouth and shot the mouth away.<br />\nNobody said much.

People who<br />\nhave been married that long don't<br />\npreface each of their rationalizations by saying,\"Of course I act<br />\nthat way, I'm Italian!\" If<br />\nKostmayer wants us to believe<br />\nthat their relationship is that implausible, he is completely undermining Joey's ability to deceive<br />\nand Rosalie's ability to keep faith<br />\nin him.<br />\nKasdan coaxes perfect performances from Hurt and Reeves as<br />\nthe two inept murderers, although<br />\nReeves is in danger of turning his<br />\ncareer into one long \"Excellent<br />\nAdventure.\" Kline's Italian<br />\ntongue-wagging is almost exhausting to listen to. The over-<br />\n<br />\nKevin Kline and Tracy Ullman in \"I Love You To Death\"\u2014an entire film, hut teeny tiny change<br />\nsaturated ethnicity is unconvincing and hardly necessary\u2014the<br />\nfact that Joey is Italian and<br />\nRosalie and her mother are<br />\nYugoslavian merely seems an excuse for the actors to break out<br />\ntheir Berlitz training tapes.<br />\nWhen Rosalie et al are bailed<br />\nout by Joey at the end of the film,<br />\nthey emerge wearing the exact<br />\nsame clothes they've worn<br />\nthroughout. One wonders: has<br />\nanything changed internally that<br />\nhasn't changed on the exterior?<br />\nThere's a flurry of tidy resolution<br />\nat the close of the film that<br />\n<br />\nsomehow works to illustrate a<br />\nteeny tiny change.

It's astonishing. It fills<br />\nthe eye. It commands you. You hate it, yes,<br />\nbut your eyes do not.

Property damage is<br />\nthe second most frequent type of<br />\nassault.\"<br />\n\"Incidents usually have one<br />\nvictim and many perpetrators.<br />\nIt's invariably more than one person [committing the incident].<br />\nThat says something about the expressability of prejudice.\"<br />\n<br />\nFurthermore, he said, many<br />\nvictims\u2014up to 85%\u2014never<br />\nreport incidents. \"Gays may not<br />\nwant to 'come out'. Blacks may<br />\nfeel that if they go to the police<br />\nthen they'll be harrassed for<br />\nreporting.\"<br />\n\"Most victims are pretty<br />\nisolated . . . they feel they don't<br />\nhave anyone they can turn to for<br />\nsupport.\" Ehrlich cautioned,<br />\nhowever, that sometimes society<br />\nfosters this isolation.<br />\n\"One of the things about incidents on campus\u2014it's easy for<br />\npeople not involved or victimized to put it [the incident] down<br />\nand dismiss it as trivial.\"<br />\n\"In fact, incidents can have<br />\nsevere repercussions. And there's<br />\nan individual response there too.<br />\nTo understand the meaning of an<br />\nincident you really have to ask the<br />\nperson who was victimized.\"<br />\nEhrlich said that the Committee could therefore serve to help<br />\nvictimized students. It should also<br />\ntry to eliminate prejudice before<br />\nit even surfaces. Because prejudice is usually generalized,<br />\nstopping just one hatred will often<br />\n<br />\nstop other ones.<br />\nEhrlich then suggested specific<br />\nsteps the Committee should take<br />\nto combat prejudice at Hopkins.<br />\nHe congratulated the committee<br />\non taking the essential first step:<br />\nforming a task force to deal with<br />\n<br />\ndone about it. The group decided to possibly institute another<br />\nsurvey and to act on it this time.<br />\nEhrlich implored the committee to reach out to students and<br />\nto mount a large publicity effort.<br />\n\"Start with the freshmen. That<br />\nway you potentially have the best<br />\nopportunity for intergroup education, by reaching the majority of<br />\nstudents in four years.\"<br />\nBut no program will be successful without extraordinary effort and publicity. And no single<br />\nmeans of publicizing will be successful in and of itself.\"<br />\nHe also urged the group,<br />\n\"Don't conduct business as<br />\nusual. Do something extraordinary.\" He related how Amherst<br />\nCollege suspended class for one<br />\nday to hold intergroup<br />\nworkshops.<br />\nBut, he cautioned, \"There is<br />\nofferings.<br />\nDean of Students Susan nothing you can do that will not<br />\nBoswell talked at length about the generate a reaction.\" He said that<br />\nresults from a campus-wide the committee should anticipate<br />\nsurvey in 1987.

Ehrlich said that<br />\nan accurate picture of the climate<br />\nat Hopkins could be obtained<br />\nthrough surveys, campus<br />\nstatistics on minorities, and an examination of curriculum<br />\n<br />\n\"One ofthe things about incidents<br />\non campus, it's easyfor people not<br />\ninvolved or victimized to put it down<br />\nand dismiss it as trivial....To understand the meaning of an incident<br />\nyou really have to ask the person<br />\nwho was victimized.\"<br />\nthe problem.<br />\nHe then recommended setting<br />\nup \"at the very least, a half-day<br />\nhuman relations workshop.\"<br />\nCommittee members endorsed<br />\nthis suggestion and agreed to try<br />\nto organize a program before the<br />\nend of the year.<br />\n<br />\nmessage of cooperation and<br />\nunderstanding. \"Redundancy is<br />\na very good thing\u2014it's<br />\nnecessary.\"<br />\nCommittee members then<br />\ndiscussed ways to raise campus<br />\nawareness, suggesting a half-day<br />\nworkshop, activity at Orientation,<br />\nand possible publicity in the<br />\nNews-Letter.<br />\nAs Dr. Francine Ashby, coordinator of Minority Student Services, pointed out, \"If we don't<br />\nkeep on going, then, as Dr.<br />\nEhrlich said, we'll lose the<br />\nmomentum and people will go<br />\nback to their previous orientations.\"<br />\nCommittee member Mona<br />\nBasta summed up the need for the<br />\ncommittee by saying, \"It's amazing, the low level of awareness<br />\nand how these things don't get<br />\npublicized. And it's not just at<br />\nHopkins, but in society in<br />\ngeneral. It's hard to believe that<br />\nincidents could happen on campus by students.

With 11 goals in 7<br />\ngames, DeVries was well ahead<br />\nof her pace of last season, during which she recorded 17 goals.<br />\nThe Jays went scoreless for the<br />\nremainder of the half, while<br />\nWestern Maryland stormed back<br />\nto score 6 straight goals, including 3 in the last three<br />\n<br />\nminutes, to construct a 7-5 lead.<br />\n\"We started to lose our concentration,\" Coach Anderson<br />\nsaid. \"We were dropping the ball<br />\nand not picking it up cleanly.<br />\nThey have speed and ran it down<br />\nour throats . . . We just had a<br />\nreally bad first half<br />\nBut Anderson\"had a lot of confidence in our team for thai game<br />\n. . . I knew we could come<br />\nback.\"<br />\nHopkins turned the tide in the<br />\nsecond half by tightening their<br />\ndefense and reeling off their own<br />\n6 goal run.<br />\nMoskal began the charge with<br />\nher first of two goals to cut the<br />\nJays' deficit to one, and junior<br />\ncenter Kathy Herring started her<br />\nsecond half hat trick with the<br />\nequalizer.<br />\nSophomore home Jessica<br />\nTropp scored the go-ahead goal<br />\nat 18:52, and the Jays had regained control.<br />\nTipton added 2 second half<br />\ngoals to record her second hat<br />\ntrick of the season, and Frame<br />\nscored again to give the Jays a 14<br />\ngoal total. The Jays defense yielded but 2 scores, and Cole had 10<br />\nsecond half saves.<br />\nWith the 14-9 victory, the Jays<br />\nneeded a win yesterday against<br />\n7-0 Washington College at<br />\nChestertown to advance to tilt<br />\nMAC final on May 5th.<br />\nMoskal scored several minutes<br />\ninto the game, and though<br />\nWashington quickly tied the<br />\ngame, Hopkins built a 5-1 edge<br />\nbefore the Shoremen tallied<br />\nagain.<br />\nThen the Jays exploded for 5<br />\nconsecutive scores to build a 10-2<br />\nedge.<br />\nBut the next 25 minutes werk<br />\nvery different.' We had alot ot<br />\ntrouble in the second half . . . we<br />\njust weren't coming up with the<br />\nball,\" Coach Anderson said.<br />\nWashington regrouped in the<br />\nsecond half to net 7 goals.The<br />\nJays added a goal to make the<br />\nfinal 11-9.<br />\n\"We couldn't score., and we<br />\nweren't coming up with the ball<br />\non the draw,\" Lagator said of the<br />\nsecond half. \"We were just glad<br />\nwhen time ran out.\"<br />\nBut the Jays had held on,and<br />\nthe MAC West title was theirs<br />\nagain.<br />\n<br />\nby Mary Hillebrand<br />\nThey may have left March like<br />\nlambs, but in the early days of<br />\nApril the Blue Jays baseball team<br />\nhas regained the ferocity that carried them through the first half of<br />\nthe season.<br />\nIn the past two weeks, Hopkins<br />\nhas accumulated a 4-1 record, to<br />\nimprove the season totals to<br />\n17-6.<br />\nAfter rolling easily over Gettysburg, 11-1, the Jays combined consistent hitting and pitching<br />\nperformances to defeat Dickinson, 9-3. Junior catcher Peter<br />\nKwiterovich and senior second<br />\nbaseman Andy Bernstein led the<br />\noffensive campaign with two hits<br />\neach, as the team outhit their opponents, 10-5. Kwiterovich drove<br />\nin two runs and scored two more<br />\nfor the Jays.<br />\nBill Paukovitz earned the win<br />\non the mound by allowing only<br />\n1 earned run in 7 innings. Blue<br />\nJay head coach Bob Babb considers Paukovitz his \"biggest surprise\" this season, as the<br />\nsophomore right-hander has accumulated a 3-0 record in 3<br />\nappearances.<br />\nApril showers gave the Jays a<br />\nday off last Saturday, forcing<br />\nthem to reschedule two games<br />\nagainst Ursinus.<br />\nSunday, Hopkins split a<br />\ndouble-header with York College<br />\nat Homewood field. In game 1,<br />\nthe Blue Jays committed three errors, allowing their opponents<br />\nthree unearned runs. The offense<br />\nwas not much better, as Hopkins<br />\nouthit their opponents 9-6, but<br />\nstranded 10 runners in only seven<br />\ninnings of play.<br />\n\"We had plenty of opportunities to score,\" noted Babb.<br />\n\"We just didn't produce when we<br />\nhad to.\"<br />\nThe loss was credited to<br />\nsophomore pitcher Jeff Fang,<br />\nwhose record now stands at 2-2.<br />\nThe second game featured a<br />\nmore poised Hopkins squad, led<br />\nby senior short stop Jim Timmerman, whose triple helped the<br />\nteam to a 5-0 lead after three innings. The Jays squeezed six runs<br />\nout of five walks and only six hits<br />\nby stealing seven bases. Senior<br />\ndesignated hitter Ron Lewis<br />\nswiped three in the 6-5 win.<br />\n<br />\nTuesday, the team traveled to<br />\nD.C. to hand Catholic U. a 6-0<br />\ndefeat. Senior Brock Bowman,<br />\nnow 3-1, pitched a complete<br />\ngame, striking out four batters<br />\nand allowing seven hits in the shutout. The Blue Jay defense turned 3 double plays to stifle<br />\nCatholic's hopes of scoring.<br />\nSaid Babb,\"This was probably<br />\nour best game of the year,<br />\ndefensively\u2014maybe even our<br />\nbest all-around performance.\"<br />\nThe errorless defensive play<br />\nwas accompanied by consistent<br />\nhitting, as the Jays opened the<br />\nfirst inning with two runs and<br />\nnever looked back. Kwiterovich<br />\nhad a double and two RBI's, batting 3-for-4 for the day. Senior<br />\noutfielder Chris D'Auria also had<br />\nthree hits in five at-bats and<br />\nknocked in another run.<br />\nRain on Wednesday added a<br />\ndouble header at Widener to<br />\nBabb's list of games to be replayed. He commented, \"Our<br />\nbiggest battle at this point seems<br />\nto be with the weather. We'd like<br />\nto be able to get out and play<br />\nregblarly.\"<br />\nLooking ahead, Hopkins has all<br />\nten Middle Atlantic Conference<br />\nsectional games still to be played,<br />\nand coach Babb hopes to use<br />\nthose games to prepare his team<br />\nfor the post-season play. Babb<br />\nsees batting under pressure as a<br />\nkey to the team's future success.<br />\n\"Our team batting average<br />\n(.333) is pretty good,\" Babb said.<br />\n\"With a team as experienced as<br />\nours, it probably should be a little higher, but leaving runners on<br />\nbase is what really matters. We<br />\nhave not been performing well<br />\nunder pressure to get the runners<br />\nhome.\"<br />\nTimmerman and Bernstein currently lead the Blue Jays in batting with .400 averages. On the<br />\nmound, senior Scott Tarantino<br />\nleads the team with a 5-1<br />\nstrikeout-walk ratio and a 2.92<br />\nearned run average.<br />\nSaturday, the Jays travel to<br />\nWashington College for a doubleheader, scheduled to begin at<br />\n1:00 p.m.<br />\n<br />\n\fNEWS-LETTER/15<br />\n<br />\nBlue Jay Calendar<br />\n<br />\nMen's track finishes third<br />\n<br />\n(April 13-20)<br />\nMen's Lacrosse<br />\n<br />\nSat.<br />\n<br />\nat Army<br />\n<br />\n4:00 pm<br />\n<br />\nBaseball<br />\n<br />\nSat.<br />\nMon.<br />\nWed.<br />\nFri.<br />\n<br />\nat Wash.

The loss<br />\nwas encouraging for the Jays<br />\nas they finished a mere six<br />\npoints behind Ursinus, the<br />\nMAC champions two years<br />\nago. Even more heartening<br />\nwas the performance of the<br />\ndistance team. Stated distance<br />\ncoach Jim Grogan,\"We were<br />\nstill in the process of training<br />\nduring that meet, so finishing<br />\nso close to a team like Ursinus<br />\nwas very encouraging.\"<br />\nNext for the Jays was the<br />\nWestern Maryland Relays,<br />\nwhich consists of approximately nine teams. The Jays finished third behind Messiah and<br />\nGettysburg for their best finish<br />\never in the seven-year-old<br />\ncompetition. \"The relay team<br />\nshowed a lot more depth that<br />\nhadn't been there in the past,\"<br />\nstated Grogan. Highlighted at<br />\nthe meet was John Robinson's<br />\nqualification for the MAC's in<br />\nthe steeplechase. By finishing<br />\nsecond, with a time of 9:43,<br />\n<br />\nRobinson was one of four<br />\nother runners to break the meet<br />\nrecord this year.

One<br />\nbright spot came out of the<br />\ncompetition as Tom Chiari<br />\nqualified tbr the MAC's in the<br />\n110 meter high hurdles.<br />\nThe Jays are looking forward to their next couple of<br />\nmeets due to the fast surfaces<br />\nand experience they will provide. Next up the Jays will face<br />\nLoyola and York at the<br />\nHomewood track. This should<br />\nbe a good opportunity for the<br />\nmembers of the team to make<br />\nthe MAC's. The team then<br />\ntravels to Messiah for a trimeet also including the<br />\nGarnets of Swarthmore. The<br />\nsquad then takes on Western<br />\nMaryland and Gettysburg at<br />\nGettysburg's brand new track.<br />\nThis should provide good experience for the members of<br />\nthe team who qualify for the<br />\nMAC's, as the championships<br />\nwill be held at Gettysburg this<br />\nyear.<br />\n<br />\nUMBC defeats rugby<br />\nby Paul Kang<br />\nThe Hopkins rugby club lost its<br />\nfirst game of the season, 16-15,<br />\nto UMBC. The first half was all<br />\nUMBC as the Retrievers jumped<br />\nto a 16-0 lead. After halftime<br />\nthough, Hopkins steadily improved its game. The Jays stopped<br />\nUMBC's potent offense and<br />\nmounted one of their own as, 25<br />\nminutes into the half, Andy<br />\nLearner ran the length of the field<br />\nin a dazzling array of moves to<br />\nput Hopkins on the board. The<br />\nkick-after, also by Learner, made<br />\nit 16-6. Ten minutes later, Scott<br />\nRompala made a crunching hit on<br />\na UMBC player that Domed the<br />\n<br />\nball into Rob Grant's hands.<br />\nGrant barrelled through to the ten<br />\nand managed to dish the ball off<br />\nto Learner, who used his<br />\nquickness and speed to round the<br />\ncorner and score. With five<br />\nminutes to play, it now stood at<br />\n16-12. 1:50 later, Learner closed the score to within one when<br />\nhe made a drop-kick from an astounding 55 yards away.<br />\nHopkins' attempts at a comeback<br />\nvictory fell just two yards short<br />\nwhen Cort Moonie made a classic<br />\ncross-body block for John<br />\nBirdseye, but time ran out before<br />\nBirdsie could ma into the<br />\nendzone.<br />\n<br />\nHockey loses Mason Dixon final, 5-0 BIA<br />\nBowyer saves 50, but Georgetown earns championship<br />\nby Jay Calkins<br />\nThe Johns Hopkins ice hockey<br />\nteam ended its finest season ever<br />\nlast week when it lost in,the,<br />\nMason Dixon Collegiate Hockey<br />\nAssociation's championship<br />\ngame. The team fell to a tough<br />\nGeorgetown squad by a score of<br />\n5-0.<br />\nThe first period of the contest<br />\nproved to be a reliable indicator<br />\nof how the whole game would be<br />\nplayed. Georgetown dominated<br />\nthe action as they outshot the Blue<br />\nJays 27-5. On offense the Hoyas<br />\nused relentless forechecking to<br />\napply suffocating pressure which<br />\nwould not allow Hopkins to get on<br />\ntrack, and which enabled<br />\nthemselves to have a number of<br />\ngood shots. Junior goaltender<br />\nDavid Bowyer stood like a rock<br />\nin the face of the onslaught,<br />\nhowever, as he successfully<br />\nthwarted all but one of<br />\nGeogetown's numerous scoring<br />\nopportunities. At the end of the<br />\n<br />\nperiod the Jays were still in it,<br />\ntrailing only 1-0.<br />\n\"After the first, I felt like we<br />\nwere lucky to be in it,\" said<br />\nCoach Wirth. \"But I knew that<br />\nwith the way Dave was playing<br />\nthat we only needed a few good<br />\nshots to pull out the victory.\"<br />\nHopkins proved unable to find<br />\nthose opportunities.<br />\nThe second period closely<br />\nresembled the first. Bowyer made<br />\nsave after save, but again could<br />\nnot stop them all. Two Hoya<br />\nshots found the net, and<br />\nGeorgetown took a 3-0 lead into<br />\nthe third period.<br />\nHopkins made its most determined offensive efforts in the<br />\nthird period. Despite some good<br />\nchances, Georgetown's defense<br />\nproved up to the challenge as it<br />\nturned back the Blue Jay forwards<br />\nempty handed. The Hoyas added two more goals in the period,<br />\nand despite am astonishing<br />\n50-save effort by Bowyer\u2014a<br />\nleague and team record\u2014<br />\n<br />\nGeorgetown captured the league<br />\nchampionship with a 5-0 victory.<br />\nIt's tough to take losing to these<br />\nguys [Georgetown] all the time,<br />\nbut I still can't complain about<br />\nour season as a whole,\" offered<br />\ncaptain Mike Holmes. Vinny Alfi<br />\nechoed the sentiment. \"If you'd<br />\nhave told me we were going to go<br />\n14-8-1 at the beginning of the<br />\nseason then I'd have said you<br />\nwere crazy. We took a young<br />\nteam without the star players<br />\nwe've had in the past, and we surpassed any goal we could've set<br />\nfor ourselves.\"<br />\nThe Jays should be as tough as<br />\never next year, but they will not<br />\nhave the services of six of the first<br />\nfour players at Hopkins.

In<br />\nhigh school, he would often practice on his own after a team<br />\nworkout. \"Back then,\" he says,<br />\n\"I worked out like a fiend and<br />\nwas in top shape.\"<br />\nComing to Hopkins was a difficult transition for him. Unlike<br />\nmany other athletes' situation, it<br />\nwasn't a step up to tougher competition; rather, it was a step<br />\ndown in his workouts. \"Here,<br />\nyou practice with the team and<br />\nthen you have to leave and do<br />\nwork, instead of working out<br />\nmore. To be honest, if academics<br />\ndidn't matter, I could have excelled further.\"<br />\nHe excelled anyway, as he<br />\nplaced in the Middle Atlantic<br />\nConference his junior and senior<br />\nyear. In addition, he has been an<br />\nAcademic All-American the past<br />\ntwo years. Part of the credit goes<br />\nto coach Andy Janquitto who<br />\ntrained the team well while being<br />\naware of academic needs and<br />\n<br />\npressures. \"He is a great coach,\"<br />\nsays Tim,\"and he always accomodates you if you have an<br />\nacademic conflict.\"<br />\nThe only major disappointment<br />\nof his career was during his<br />\nsophomore year as he didn't place<br />\nin the MAC. \"I was having a<br />\ngreat season,\" he recalls. \"I lost<br />\na close match early on lin the<br />\nMAC tournament] and then selfdestructed in the next match. It<br />\nwas a case of not being in as good<br />\na shape as possible. It motivated<br />\nme for next year. I realized that<br />\nyou can't go half-assed and that<br />\nyou have to have a good balance<br />\namong athletics, academics,<br />\nand extracurriculars.\"<br />\n\"Engineering is a good major<br />\nto have now,\" he says,\"and the<br />\nfaculty in the department are<br />\ngreat.\"<br />\nThe future is hazy for Tim as<br />\nhe is unsure of what he wants to<br />\ndo. His number one choice is to<br />\ngo to Japan and teach English,<br />\neven though he doesn't speak<br />\nJapanese yet.<br />\nLike many undergraduates<br />\nhere, he is concerned about<br />\nthe social aspects of Hopkins.<br />\n\"I've seen some good attempts<br />\nfrom the university to help the<br />\nsocial life, like the Faculty-Student<br />\nInteraction program here, and<br />\nI've seen some negative things,<br />\nlike the lack of a student untion<br />\nand proper housing for all<br />\nstudents. Hopkins is a great<br />\nlearning institution, but its<br />\nstudents need a social outlet. The<br />\nlack of one can lead to an<br />\nunhealthy environment.\"<br />\nBeing active is important to<br />\nTim, which is why he likes the<br />\nsize of Hopkins. \"It is small<br />\nenough that I've been able to do<br />\nwhatever I wanted to do.

McColl<br />\nThe punchline is this: luxury's<br />\nlap.<br />\nMy roommates and I graduate<br />\nin May, and our landlord, being<br />\nall-too-aware of this fact, has<br />\nalready started looking for new<br />\ntenants. In fact, we had some<br />\npeople stop in the other night to<br />\nlook at the place. They seemed<br />\nfavorably impressed.<br />\nAh youth.<br />\nLook, I don't claim to be the<br />\nend-all be-all of knowledge in the<br />\nrenting and leasing world, but<br />\nhaving lived in three different<br />\napartments in my four years at<br />\nschool, I'd like to think that I've<br />\nacquired a few clues. I mean,<br />\nthere are things that you just don't<br />\ncount on when you look for a<br />\nplace to stay.<br />\nFor example, the fact that an<br />\napartment is empty and echoes a<br />\nlot when you look at it is no indication that it's going to hold all<br />\nyour junk. Every college student<br />\nis a direct evolutionary descendent of the packrat. We all have<br />\nstupid things that we refuse to<br />\npart with, like the neon letters we<br />\nwrenched off the sign at the Kmart near our house because they<br />\nwere our initials, or the 20'x35'<br />\nGrateful Dead industrial silk promo banner that we lifted from the<br />\nHicksville Grandstand Paladium<br />\nand Show Palace. Typically, the<br />\nfelonies resulting in said acquisitions begin with the phrase,<br />\n\"Gee, that'd look great on my<br />\nwall at school.\" The fact of the<br />\nmatter is that it will only look<br />\ngreat if you decide to move into<br />\nthe Hicksville Grandstand<br />\nPaladium and Show Palace.<br />\nCockroaches are another thing.<br />\nEvery dorm-housed freshman<br />\nclaims to know about them and<br />\nto be prepared to deal with them.<br />\nWell, let me tell you something:<br />\nwe're not talking about some silly Raid commercial cockroach<br />\nwho lifts his skirt and runs into<br />\nthe corner when the disinfectant<br />\nspray is put in his aquarium. The<br />\ncockroaches you'll have to deal<br />\nwith are the ones who used to<br />\nheat up those others at school an&amp;<br />\nsteal their lunch money. Think<br /><br />\nabout this rationally\u2014I lived on<br />\nthe fifth floor of McCoy my<br />\nfreshman year. To a cockroach,<br />\nthe average stair looks about thirty or forty feet high. That means<br />\nto the average cockroach, I lived<br />\non top of Mount McKinley. And<br />\nthey climbed up to my room by<br />\nhand. The rock climbers of the<br />\ninsect world, very big, very<br />\nmuscular. You will come home<br />\nto four of them sitting on your<br />\ndesk playing cards and smoking<br />\ncigars. \"Where the hell've ya<br />\nbeen?\" they'll say. \"You've got<br />\nmessages by the phone. AND<br />\nOF<br />\nOUT<br />\nYOU'RE<br />\nSALTINES!\" And don't try<br />\nstore-bought insecticides. In the<br />\nBaltimore Roach Hotel, roaches<br />\ncheck in, complain about the size<br />\nof their room, build up a large<br />\nroom service tab, go down and<br />\nbeat the snot out of the desk<br />\nmanager, and then check out<br />\nWithout paying.<br />\nMice are another thing. We all<br />\nthink it's so cute that the squirrels on campus come so close to<br />\nus and aren't afraid. Yeah, well<br />\nwait till some night when you're<br />\nleaning against your couch watching television and a rodent tiptoes across the back of your neck<br />\nand see how cute that is.<br />\nOther points: living in my current apartment(which I shall say<br />\nis in the Nayfare to disguise its<br />\nidentity) is great in terms of location, don't get me wrong. I love<br />\nbeing able to roll out of bed and<br />\nonto campus. But I've mentioned the antics of the local garbage<br />\nmen in another column. I'm also<br />\nable to witness firsthand the occasional (every twenty minutes or<br />\nso) drills that the local fire department holds, since 33rd Street<br />\nseems to be the only street<br />\nstraight enough for them to drive<br />\non safely. Unfortunately, I never<br />\nget to see them test their hoses or<br />\nladders, but whoo-boy, their<br />\nsirens are in top form.<br />\nAs an added bonus, some lucky<br />\nguy across the alley from me has<br />\njust purchased a BRAND NEW<br /><br />\nAcademic Council should hold its horses<br />\nThe Student Council is to be commended for taking a<br />\nfirm stand against the Academic Council's proposal to<br />\nmandate a student engineering representative on the Committee for Undergraduate Studies (CUS). One of the<br />\ntrademarks of Council's approach this year has been<br />\nserious attention to the rule of law in both their own proceedings and those of the University. By insisting that<br />\nCouncil would continue to exercise its legal right to appoint student representatives to CUS, it refused to allow<br />\ntheir already severely circumscribed power to be limited<br />\nby administrative fiat. It is regretable that the Academic<br />\nCouncil has been so petulant about accepting the CUS's<br />\nconsidered objections to a BA in Engineering. In the long<br />\nrun, however, the Academic Council's impatience with<br />\ndue process, as seen in their handling of the CUS membership question, is most alarming. If student representation<br />\non University committees merely means that their presence<br />\nis welcome only so long as they are seen but not heard,<br />\nthen that is not representation at all.<br />\nThe Academic Council's next step will define the administration's relationship with its undegraduates for years<br />\nto come. It would be refreshing if the Council appreciated<br /><br />\nthe concerned and informed students who sit on CUS,and<br />\nattempted to work with them rather than against them.<br />\nSince this has not been the case so far, a solution to the<br />\ncurrent disagreement between the CUS, Student Council,<br />\nand the Academic Council presents itself.<br />\nNo further decisions should be made by the Academic<br />\nCouncil vis a vis undergraduate representation on CUS,<br />\nor the voting status of the Academic Advisors, until the<br />\nRichardson Administration takes command of the University in July. A serious restructuring of the University's<br />\nundergraduate division is in order, and such work should<br />\nbe a combined initiative including the students, the<br />\nAcademic Council, and Dr. Richardson.<br />\nThe Academic Council would do well to stop behaving<br />\nlike petulant parents who are finding it difficult to accept<br />\nthat their children have found their behavior to be ethically flawed. The CUS and the Academic Advisors have only the undergraduates' best interests in mind. It would be<br />\nto all of our benefits to wait until the University's leadership vacuum is filled in July before the Academic Council decides to further antagonize the undergraduates.<br /><br />\nThe Pre Frosh, they are a comin'<br />\nHigh school seniors will be arriving in hordes next week<br />\nto check out the Homewood campus. Just what does<br />\nHopkins have to inspire these young whippersnappers to<br />\ncome here over an Ivy or Big Ten school? As much as<br />\nwe gripe and complain from our little stone building in<br />\na ditch, the News-Letter thinks this place has quite a bit<br />\nto offer.<br />\nWhile the facade of immaculately manicured lawns and<br />\nrestored pseudo-Georgian architecture hides the financial<br />\ncrisis occurring in Arts and Sciences, it does not obscure<br />\nthe classrooms where demanding academics still reside.<br />\nThe History department is among the top five in the country, and rising quickly to national attention is the Physics<br />\nand Astronomy department. The student-faculty ratio is<br />\nalso a plus; it's still low enough to allow for a one-to-one<br />\nrelationship that is rare at other universities.<br />\nAs always stressed down here at the Gatehouse,<br />\nacademics are ndt everything, and pre-frosh will get a<br /><br />\nchance to savor some extracurricular activities at next<br />\nweekend's open house. One of the greatest aspects of going to Hopkins is the diversity of the student body, reflected<br />\nin the many groups on campus. There are sororities and<br />\nfraternities as well as clubs for bridge players, comic book<br />\ncollectors, ham radio operators (not to mention our humble newspaper), etc., all of which will be in the Glass<br />\nPavilion next Saturday.<br />\nAthletics are also an integral part of Hopkins life and<br />\nwe don't just mean the time-honored tradition of men's<br />\nlacrosse. (Especially this year. We do have an excellent<br />\nteam, but several other schools seem to have more excellent<br />\nones.) Men's basketball, field hockey and ice hockey went<br />\nfar beyond expectations this year and there is always room<br />\nfor improvement on the football team.<br />\nSo this week, as pre-frosh run amok, remember how<br />\nmuch this university has to offer and try not to give an<br />\nundeservedly negative impression.,<br /><br />\nLetters<br />\nLibrary<br />\nTo the Editor:<br />\nOn April 20th and 21st, the<br />\nMilton S.

The long<br />\nawaited billion-dollar hotel has<br />\n420 million sq. ft. resting along<br />\n17 beach-front acres. It has a<br />\n120,000 sq.-ft. casino with barrel vaulted ceilings, luscious red<br />\ncarpets, and 24 hand-carved<br />\nAustrian crystal chandeliers (at<br />\n$250,000 apiece). Room prices<br />\nvary from $250 for a normal<br />\nroom to $10,000 for the Alexander the Great suite. Though one<br />\nmight question the excessive<br />\nspending, or perhaps the authenticity of the reproduction (one<br />\nTime magazine columnist called<br />\nthe hotel the \"work of a candymaker gone mad\"), there is little doubt of Mr. Trump's ability<br />\nto write large checks.<br />\nAs if Mr. Trump's unsavory<br />\nfamily life was not enough, the<br />\nopening of the Taj Mahal this<br />\nweek has focused even more<br />\nmedia attention on the fading fortunes of America's most<br />\ncelebrated millionaire. The comments have been less than flattering. Barron's Mr. Alan Abelson<br />\ndescribed the Taj Mahal as<br />\n\"Donald Trump's latest contribution to the enrichment of Western<br />\nCivilization and Donald Trump\"<br />\nand added that \"they are not, in<br />\ncase you wondered, one and the<br />\nsame: Western Civilization is<br />\nolder.\" Mr. Abelson went on to<br />\nchronicle the sad plight of Mr.<br />\nMarvin Roffman, until last week<br />\nan entertainment industry analyst<br />\nfor the firm of Janney Montgomery Scott. It seems that Mr.<br />\nRoffman had the temerity to mention, horror of horrors, that<br />\nAtlantic City was \"an ugly and<br />\ndreary kind of place\" and that<br />\nMr. Trump might have trouble<br />\nbreaking even in a slow<br />\neconomy. These comments must<br />\nhave seriously distressed bondholders in the Taj Mahal venture,<br />\nbut they were even more distressing for Mr. Roffman. Upon<br />\nreceiving a strongly worded com-<br /><br />\nPUNCH, from 4<br />\nELECTRIC GUITAR. Yay! Unfortunately, the music store must<br />\nhave been plumb out of talent that<br />\nday, on account of every song he<br />\nplays sounds like this:<br />\nSCREEEEEE00WWWHHHEE<br />\n(kplang)(chunk) REE00WWW<br />\n(distortion) (wah box effects)<br />\nSCREEEEEEE (lots of vibrato)<br />\n000HHH (fade until memory<br />\nkicks in with next Hendrix song).<br />\nI have a strong suspicion that<br />\nhis fingers are permanently bent<br />\ninto fists and that he can do<br />\nnothing but bang on the poor<br />\nguitar. I would be greatly relieved if he would play one song from<br />\nbeginning to end, instead of just<br />\nthe snippets he does play. Every<br />\ntime I hear him, I feel like I'm<br />\nlistening to a commercial for the<br />\nnext time he plays.<br />\nAnyway. These are all things<br />\nthat you can't possibly know<br />\nwhen you look at an apartment.<br />\nLike when those people came to<br />\nlook at my apartment and they<br />\nasked me about the peeling paint<br />\nand the spots on the ceiling in the<br />\nbathroom. What I told them is<br />\nthat it just started chipping and<br />\neventually the landlord will come<br />\nin and repaint.

One of the points that Dr.<br />\nDyson made was that he saw the<br />\nscientific pursuit as a rebellion<br />\nagainst the restrictions of society. Dr. Dyson stated that the best<br />\nscientists are often the most<br />\noutspoken social activists.<br />\nI find myself here at Hopkins<br />\ntrying to lead the double life of<br />\nscientist/activist and wondering if<br />\nwhat Dr. Dyson said may have<br />\nbeen true in his youth but holds<br />\nlittle bearing in today's world.<br />\nHopkins is a pool of the most<br />\ntalented people. I have met<br />\nfriends here that have the ability<br />\nand vision that leave me<br />\nspeechless. Yet, one of the few<br />\nthings I do not see here at<br />\nHopkins is a surplus of idealism.<br />\nI do not believe that Hopkins<br />\ndeserves any special blame for<br />\nthis lack of idealism. Most people today seem to put little stock<br />\n, in their ability to have any effect<br />\non the world, let alone a positive<br />\neffect. Yet, the thought of a community of people with the<br />\nresources of a universtity at their<br />\nfingertips all feeling powerless<br />\nseems absurd. If the Hopkins<br />\ncommunity cannot target injustice<br /><br />\nS<br />\nWHO, tie ?<br /><br />\nboEtt. \u2022\u2022\u2022 w\u2022i\u2022 \u2022\u2022<br />\nACTUALLY....<br /><br />\nMichael Falk of Amnesty Intl<br />\nin the world, who can?<br />\nIt is true, things have changed<br />\ngreatly since my days as a<br />\nfreshman. An active women's<br />\ncenter has grown to the point<br />\nwhere it can effectively rally the<br />\nHopkins community to defend<br />\nwomen's reproductive rights.<br />\nThe Students for Environmental<br />\nAction have taken root and<br />\nbecome one of the largest groups<br />\non campus, utilizing student<br />\nvolunteers to implement campuswide recycling. Plus, the Amnesty International group which I<br />\nhelped to start two years ago has<br />\nattempted to keep Hopkins aware<br />\nof the state of human rights<br />\nthroughout the world. These have<br />\njoined the Circle K which served as an effective community service group long before I arrived.<br />\nSo if things are changing for<br />\nthe better, why am I yelling this<br />\ncall to arms? Students do not<br />\nrealize the potential they have to<br />\neffect change in the world. There<br />\nwas a time when it was common<br />\nfor students to stand up for what<br />\nthey believed in. Today it seems<br />\nlike a small minority.<br />\nIf you are wondering, \"Why<br />\nshould I bother?\" I would reply<br />\nthat my work for Amnesty has<br />\nbeen the most rewarding work<br />\nI've done at Hopkins. To illustrate my point I would like to<br /><br />\nshare with you a piece of my<br />\ndiary dated February 10, 1990:<br />\nToday was \"Teach For<br />\nAmerica Day\" and a friend and<br />\nI had the opportunity to teach a<br />\n25-minute course to fifth graders<br />\nabout human rights. It was so<br />\nmuch fun!<br />\nFirst I asked what rights they<br />\ncould think of. The responses<br />\nvaried from \"to dress how you<br />\nwant\" and \"to say what you<br />\nwant\" to \"to go fishing\" or \"to<br />\ngo to college.\" Then we discussed how in the old days there were<br />\nkings who could say, \"You are<br />\nnot allowed to fish!\" or \"I do not<br />\nwant you wearing blue jeans ever<br />\nagain!\" So, I asked the kids how<br />\nthey would feel. Well, they said<br />\nthey would be angry.<br />\nThen we discussed, \"If a friend<br />\nof yours was being denied a right,<br />\nwhat could you do to help them?\"<br />\nIn the first class I taught, the<br />\nstudents decided they would help<br />\nthat friend leave the country, and<br />\nlet the friend stay at their house<br />\nafter getting free. in the scond<br />\nclass, they decided to write to the<br />\nking and send petitions (what<br />\nsmart kids!), but they wanted to<br />\nstay on his good side.<br />\nThen I explained that Amnesty International sends letters and<br />\nhow Amnesty tries to get many<br />\npeople to write so the king has to<br /><br />\nopen these letters all day that say,<br />\n\"Why can't my friend go<br />\nfishing?\" Amnesty hopes that the<br />\nking will get fed up and try to<br />\nhelp solve the problem.<br />\nI then distributed a Children's<br />\nEdition Urgent Action which we<br />\nread together. It concerned a 15<br />\nyear old in Peru who was arrested<br />\nwithout charge and in danger of<br />\nbeing hurt. I think the kids were<br />\nhappy they could read something<br />\nso important and surprised that<br />\nthis could happen. I suggested<br />\nthat they take the Urgent Action<br />\nand a copy of the Universal<br />\nDeclaration of Human Rights and<br />\ntalk about this with their parents.<br />\nMaybe some will write letters.<br />\nAfter the class someone told<br />\nme that Nelson Mandela will be<br />\nfree tomorrow.<br /><br />\nThe News-Letter<br />\nWelcomes its<br />\nEditorial Board<br />\n1990-1991<br />\nfor<br />\nOVERI,OADED WITH FINALS<br />\nEditors in Chief:<br />\nT.H.

Kern<br />\nCHICAGO\u2014When a reclusive<br />\nwriter crawls out of his cave and<br />\ndrops a new book into the lap of<br />\nthe public, we're supposed to<br />\nhave no questions for him. \"It's<br />\nall in the book,\" he'll say. But<br />\nwhat if the book only generates<br />\nmore questions\u2014big ones, the<br />\nkind that a professor or randparent can't resolve?<br />\nIn that case, it's probabt/ best<br />\nto go to the source, aid ask<br />\nnovelist Tim O'Brien: Wiat ex<br />\nactly is going on here? In he fne<br />\nyears since the publicaticn of hs<br />\nastonishing comic-apalypic<br />\nnovel, \"The Nuclear tge\" he<br />\nhas been chiselling cut \"The<br />\nThings They Carried\" Houghton<br />\nMifflin/Seymour Lairence), a<br />\nbook that is at once stonishingly lucid and, on anorler level, Officult to penetrate-the literary<br />\n, equivalent of bulleproof glass.<br />\nQuestions aboud, for \"The<br />\nThings They Ciried\" is an<br />\nelegant and divere collection of<br />\nshort stories that as unified and<br />\nsturdily constructed as a novel.<br />\nO'Brien claims ii an introductory<br />\nnote that the bo(k is fiction (\"except for a fewdetails regarding<br />\n, the author's ovn life\"); yet, two<br />\n1 pages later, he dedicates tlt book<br />\n; \"to the men ei Alpha company,\"<br />\nall of whom tppear as characters<br />\ni in the book<br />\n\"The Things They Caned\" is<br />\nridden with similar twists loops,<br />\nand literary figure-eghts\u2014<br />\ndevices which, despit their<br />\ncrystalline prose, leave tb reader<br />\nguessing.

Which of these stories<br />\nare rue and which are invented?<br />\nIt toesn't help that the main<br />\nchracter in the book is an exceedingly articulate fellow<br />\nlimed Tim O'Brien, who, it so<br />\nVappens, is a 43-year-old writer<br />\nwho once served in Vietnam.<br />\nThose familiar with O'Brien's<br />\nprevious books, especially the incandescent \"Going After Cacciato,\" which won the 1979 National Book Award for fiction,<br />\nhave reason to wonder. Is this yet<br />\nanother \"Vietnam book?\" Or, to<br />\nput it as bluntly as some critics<br />\nhave: Is O'Brien sneaking bones<br />\nfrom the same old literary grave?<br />\nReading \"The Things They<br />\nCarried,\" arguably the best book<br />\nof O'Brien's career, these questions crumble into irrelevance.<br />\nThough the majority of the book<br />\nis set in Vietnam, this is in no<br />\nsense a mere \"book about war.\"<br />\nO'Brien is an incisive and astute<br />\nreporter of the human conscience;<br />\nthe prose in the pages of his latest<br />\n\"book\"\u2014not a novel, not a story<br />\ncollection\u2014often reads with the<br />\nclarity and conciseness of<br />\ntelegraph messages from the heart<br />\nto the mind.<br />\nThose messages, which<br />\nO'Brien has distilled from nearly twenty years of writing about<br />\nand imagining the war, form the<br />\ncenter of \"The Things They Carried,\" which is of itself a work<br />\nof the imagination, camouflaged<br />\nas fact. For O'Brien, the experieice of Vietnam has nurtured<br />\nthe reed to tell stories, to explain<br />\nand revise events until they synch<br /><br />\nwith his perception of them<br />\ntwenty years later.<br />\nBesides the rifles, packs, firstaid kits, marijuana, C-rations,<br />\nand occasional candy bars that the<br />\nsoldiers carry in these pages, they<br />\nalso shoulder the weight of<br />\ndreams, irrational and rational<br />\nfears, ambitions, jokes, desires,<br />\nand the need to tell stories\u2014<br />\ncommon payloads for people in<br />\nall circumstances, from all<br />\nbackgrounds.<br />\nYet it isn't O'Brien's message<br />\nthat endows \"The Things They<br />\nCarried\" with such impact; it's<br />\nhis dazzling set of variations on<br />\nthe theme. In the title story of the<br />\nbook, a lieutenant carries notquite-love letters from a girl at a<br />\ncollege in New Jersey, convinced that she would love him if he<br />\nwere back in the States. One day,<br />\nwhile he daydreams about her<br />\ntongue and her kneecaps, one of<br />\nhis men is killed. The lieutenant<br />\nblames himself for the death; the<br />\nnext day he burns the letters.<br />\nIn \"The Sweetheart of the<br />\nSong Tra Bong,\" a soldier named<br />\nRat Kiley tells his buddies a story<br />\nabout a soldier who shipped his<br />\ngirlfriend from Cincinnati into<br />\nVietnam. The girl enters the story<br />\nwearing culottes and an innocent<br />\nsmile, and she exits utterly<br />\ntransformed\u2014uninterested in her<br />\nboyfriend, chummy with a bloodthirsty group of Green Berets,<br />\nwearing a necklace made of<br />\nhuman tongues.<br />\nSome of \"The Things They<br />\nCarried\" stretches credibility;<br />\nsome of it is utterly plausible.<br />\nLike their creator, these<br /><br />\nI<br /><br />\nMachine<br /><br />\ncharacters are fascinated by the<br />\nlines that separate truth and fiction, and O'Brien consistently<br />\npresents them\u2014and the reader\u2014<br />\nwith hurdles of fact and invention<br />\nthat they must either duck or leap<br />\nover. This aspect of the book, as<br />\nO'Brien admitted during a recent<br />\ninterview, amounts to something<br />\nof a game between novelist and<br />\nreader.<br />\nYet these devices never appear<br />\nwithout a purpose, and for all of<br />\nthe apparent morbidity and loss<br />\nweaved throughout these stories,<br />\nthere are corresponding threads<br />\nof beauty and, perhaps most<br />\nvaluable, profound understanding.<br />\nIt's all in the book.<br />\n(This interview was conducted<br />\nMarch 15 at the Omni Ambassador East Hotel in Chicago.)<br />\nNews-Letter: What inspired you<br />\nto play such blatant and elaborate<br />\ngames with the lines between fiction and non-fiction in the book?<br />\nAt one point you talk about Rat<br />\nKiley 's methods of storytelling,<br />\nand you write that \"He told a<br />\nstory to heat up the truth, to make<br />\nit burn so hot that you couldfeel<br />\nexactly what hefelt.\"Is that what<br />\nyou were trying to do in the book?<br />\nO'Brien: That's a good, apt piece<br />\nof language to pull out of the<br />\nbook, because it has to do with<br />\nwhy the book was done as it was<br />\ndone . . .[one of my methods]<br />\nwas to invent and then call in the<br />\ntruth. In either case your purpose<br />\nis to somehow engage the reader<br />\nso the reader will feel something<br />\nof what you felt. Even though the<br />\nsurface of the events may have<br />\nnothing to do with what you felt<br />\nat all\u2014they may be entirely made<br />\nup\u2014you're trying to get at emotion and issues ofjustice or guilt<br />\nor whatever is on the table. That<br />\nchunk of language seems to me<br />\nto represent the aboutness of the<br />\nbook, in a way.<br />\nN-L: How did the book's structure evolve? There are obviously<br />\nseveral different angles you tried.<br /><br />\nNovelist Tim O'Brien, whose latest book deliberately deceives the reader<br />\nto get at the truth<br />\nO'Brien: [Developing a book's<br />\nstructure] always happens differently. Part of it was just<br />\nsimplicity: I wanted to write a<br />\nbook that, on the surface, could<br />\nbe read in a very simple,<br />\nstorytelling way. And the book<br />\ncan be read that way\u2014and will be<br />\nread that way\u2014by most people,<br />\nmost readers. It could be read as<br />\na memoir, I think. Which is fine;<br />\nI don't care. What I do care<br />\n[about] is that it is believed.<br />\nI wanted the book to be read<br />\nsimply, and [to be] believed on<br />\nthe surface. But underneath it,<br />\nthere were all kinds of storytelling things that I wanted to explore<br />\nsomehow. Not that I have<br />\nanything to say about these<br />\nthings; I wanted to explore them<br />\nin the stories themselves. And by<br />\nhaving an invented, 43-year-old<br />\nTim O'Brien telling about telling<br />\nstories\u2014and worrying about telling stories\u2014to engage the reader<br />\nnot just in the stories themselves,<br />\nbut in the making of stories.<br />\nHence [O'Brien's fictional<br />\ndaughter] Kathleen: 'Why are<br />\nyou so obsessed about the war?'<br />\n'I'm not obsessed,' he says. 'The<br />\nwar stuff is not what I'm obsessed by. It's all these stories.' As<br /><br />\na response, [I wrote part of the<br />\nlx)ok] in a dramatic setting: make<br />\nup a daughter asking a question<br />\nof the author, of Tim's character,<br />\nso that there's a dramatic setting.<br />\nPeople are talking to people about<br />\nthe book that's being read, essentially, as opposed to [my] interjecting a sort of little essay.<br />\nThat word you used was really appropriate\u2014the word<br />\n\"game.\" For me [a game] is part<br />\nof writing: it's fun. There should<br />\nbe a sense ofjoy and fun and trying different modes of engaging<br />\npeople. And one way to engage<br />\npeople in a bar is to pull them by<br />\nthe lapels [imitates the motion].<br />\nAnother is to tell a joke. Another<br />\nis to stand on your head. In fiction, the ordinary ways of engaging readers have little to do with<br />\nthings like description, dialogue,<br />\ncharacterization\u2014you engage<br />\nthem in the reality of the story.<br />\nThis [fact and invention technique] seemed to me one way of<br />\nengaging the reader in the reality, the immediacy, and the urgency of the stuff\u2014to make it feel as<br />\nif O'Brien is talking, opening up<br />\nabout this stuff, so it feels immediate and urgent.<br />\nSee INTERVIEW, 8<br /><br />\nCONCERTS<br /><br />\nMusical Showcase '90 Appeals<br />\nDespite Lack of Polish<br />\nby Christopher Bonanos<br />\n\u2022<br /><br />\n1<br /><br />\nRafael and squad of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles\u2014ninety minutes of shell games<br />\nkids, who pay children's prices.<br />\nDirected by Steve Barron, best<br />\nSome (ineiding this reviewer) known for his Dire Straits and<br />\nlooked emirrassed to be there; Michael Jackson videos,<br />\nothers brght their kids.

At a couple<br />\nof points in the book you say,<br />\n'You have to believe this, or tell<br />\nthe reader, 'You don't know<br />\nwhat's credible, you don't know<br />\nwhat's true.'<br />\nO'Brien: It's just a neat device.<br />\nI don't think it's any better or any<br />\nworse [than any other method of<br />\nstorytelling]; it's just kind of neat.<br />\nThings are neat, and \"neat\"<br />\nmeans neat in all kinds of ways:<br />\nit means emotionally neat; it<br />\nmeans intellectually neat. [It<br />\nadds] all kinds of intellectual<br />\nlayers to things\u2014cerebral and<br />\nemotional layers\u2014when you have<br />\nthat sense of presence there [on<br />\nthe page]. That's what I was<br />\nstriving for in this book. Of all<br />\nthe books I've written, it was by<br />\nfar the hardest to write because<br />\nsimplicity isn't my forte [laughs).<br />\nI don't think simply, I don't write<br />\nsimply, but I've always been entranced by it when it's done<br />\nwell\u2014the way [Jorge Luis]<br />\nBorges does it. Simple storytelling, with all kinds of things happening underneath. It just entrances me.<br /><br />\n'Are men and women<br /><br />\nthat different, that<br />\na woman is absolutely<br />\nincapable of evil?'<br />\nN-L: In the story \"The<br />\nSweetheart of the Song Tra<br />\nBong,\" you have Rat Kiley doing an even more insistent kind of<br /><br />\nMO<br /><br />\nstorytelling. He more or less tries<br />\nto sell the story he's telling\u2014not<br />\njust to the people listening to him<br />\nin the story, but to the reader as<br />\nwell.<br />\nO'Brien: There are a couple of<br />\ndifferent levels [at work in that<br />\nstory]. On the main level\u2014the<br />\nway one hopes it will be read\u2014<br />\nyou'll laugh, but you'll be intrigued by a few things. One is<br />\nthe language Rat's using: he's<br />\nsaying things like, 'We've all<br />\nseen weirder shit than this.'[And<br />\nthen he says to the guys in the<br />\nstory:]'You believe a guy comes<br />\nback from the bush; he claims he<br />\nsaw the Virgin Mary riding a<br />\ngoose out there, and everybody<br />\nswallows it. They ask, How fast<br />\nwas she going'? Was she wearing<br />\nspurs'?'<br />\nOn a second level, there's the<br />\ncommentary about a story which,<br />\non the surface, would seem to<br />\nmost readers unbelievable. But<br />\nRat, in a way, is standing in for<br />\nme and for every other writer in<br />\nthe world, I think, by saying,<br />\n'You're crazy\u2014what's so<br />\nunbelievable? You're swallowing<br />\nall of this [makes a sweeping<br />\ngesture' and you swallow living<br />\nwith the bomb, and you swallow<br />\nfathers leaving their kids forever<br />\nbehind them, and all this shit in<br />\nthe world. You swallow that, but<br />\nyou can't believe that a girl can<br />\nget on an airplane, and fly to<br />\nVietnam?<br />\nAnd his argument is to me an<br />\nentirely convincing one.

That is, it's an incredible<br />\nthing in a Platonic sense\u2014up<br />\nthere, [in theory], it's credible.<br />\nBut down here [in reality], when<br />\nsomeone attaches it to human beings, it somehow turns into this<br />\nincredible thing. What's so incredible about it? Get on a plane,<br />\nfly to Vietnam, land there. Are<br />\nmen and women that different,<br />\nthat a woman is absolutely incapable of evil'?

The<br />\n\"truth\" to which he refers throughout the book<br />\nis, put simply, emotional honesty\u2014fidelity to<br />\nthe feelings, and not necessarily the physical<br />\nfacts, ofany given situation. Like the great majority of \"The Things They Carried,\" this excerpt is almost entirely fictional.<br />\nIn a true war story, if there's a moral at all,<br />\nit's like the thread that makes the cloth. You<br />\ncan't tease it out. You can't extract the meaning without unraveling the deeper meaning.<br />\nAnd in the end, really, there's nothing much<br />\nto say about a true war story, except maybe<br />\n\"Oh.'<br />\nTrue war stories do not generalize. They do<br />\nnot indulge in abstraction or analysis.<br />\nFor example: War is hell. As a moral<br />\ndeclaration the old truism seems perfectly true,<br />\nand yet because it abstracts, because it<br />\ngeneralizes, I can't believe it with my stomach.<br />\nNothing turns inside.<br />\nIt comes down to gut instinct. A true war<br />\nstory, if truly told, makes the stomach believe.<br />\nThis one does it for me. I've told it before\u2014<br />\nmany times, many versions\u2014but here's what<br />\nactually happened.<br />\nWe crossed that river and marched west into the mountains. On the third day, Curt Lemon<br />\nstepped on a booby-trapped 105 round. He was<br />\nplaying catch with Rat Kiley, laughing, then<br />\nhe was dead. The trees were thick; it took us<br />\nnearly an hour to cut an LZ for the dustoff.<br />\nLater, higher in the mountains, we came<br />\nacross a baby VC water buffalo. What it was<br />\ndoing there I don't know\u2014no farms or<br />\npaddies\u2014but we chased it down and got a rope<br />\naround it and led it along to a deserted village<br />\nwhere we set up for the night. After supper Rat<br />\nKiley went over and stroked its nose.<br />\nHe opened up a can of C rations, pork and<br />\nbeans, but the baby buffalo wasn't interested.<br />\nRat shrugged.<br />\nHe stepped back and shot it through the right<br />\nfront knee. The animal did not make a sound.<br />\nIt went down hard, then got up again, and Rat<br />\ntook careful aim and shot off an ear. He shot<br />\nit in the hindquarters and in the little hump at<br />\nits back. He shot it twice in the flanks. It wasn't<br />\nto kill; it was to hurt. He put the rifle muzzle<br />\nup to its mouth and shot the mouth away.<br />\nNobody said much. The whole platoon stood<br />\n4 gs, bUt<br />\nthere watching, feeling all kinds,<br />\nthere wasn't a great deal of pity' for t e baby<br /><br />\nwatcr buffalo. Curt Lemon was dead. Rat Kiley<br />\nhad ost his best friend in the world. Later in<br />\nthe wek he would write a long personal letter<br />\nto theguy's sister, who would not write back,<br />\nbut foinow it was a question of pain. He shot<br />\noff the gil. He shot away chunks of meat below<br />\nthe ribs.All around us there was the smell of<br />\nsmoke ad filth and deep greenery, and the evning was humid and very hot. Rat went to<br />\nautomatic He shot randomly, almost casually, quick htle spurts in the belly and butt. Then<br />\nhe reloadec, squatted down, and shot it in the<br />\nleft front kree. Again the animal fell hard and<br />\ntried to get \\p, but this time it couldn't quite<br />\nmake it. It wIbbled and went down sideways.<br />\nRat shot it inthe nose. He bent forward and<br />\nwhispered somthing, as if talking to a pet, then<br /><br />\nTor a tine no one spoke.<br />\nWe had wtnesied something<br />\nessential, 5.orncthing brandnew and prtfoind, a piece of<br />\nthe world s) startling there<br />\nwas not yet a nwme for it.'<br />\nhe shot it in the throat. All te while the baby<br />\nwater buffalo was silent, or anost silent, just<br />\na light bubbling sound where tit nose had been.<br />\nIt lay very still. Nothing movedtxcept the eyes,<br />\nwhich were enormous, the puils shiny black<br />\nand dumb.<br />\nRat Kiley was crying. He tried to say<br />\nsomething, but then cradled his ifle and went<br />\noff by himself.<br />\nThe rest of us stood in a ragged tircle around<br />\nthe baby buffalo. For a time no on spoke. We<br />\nhad witnessed something essential something<br />\nbrand-new and profound, a piece cf the world<br />\nso startling there was not yet a nane for it.<br />\nSomebody kicked the baby buffalo.<br />\nIt was still alive, thoigh just barely, just in<br />\nthe eyes.<br />\n\"Amazing,\" Dave Jemen said. \"My whole<br />\nlife, I never seen anytling like it.\"'<br />\n\"Nev:tr?\"<br />\n\"Not hardly.

It's like a version<br />\nof \"Crimes and Misdemeanors\"<br />\ngone horribly wrong, a leisurely<br />\nconcocted witches' brew of<br />\nsimple-minded malice.<br />\nPizza restauranteur Joey Bocca (Kevin Kline) and his wife<br />\nRosalie (Tracey Ullman) are<br />\nmired in a superfically successful<br />\nmarriage: they have two kids and<br />\ndon't fight most of the time. But<br />\nwhen Joey's not tossing pizza<br />\ndough in the air, he's performing<br />\nminor maintenance tasks in the<br />\napartments of young females in<br />\nhis building around the corner.<br />\nYou get the picture when Kasdan<br />\nslowly pans across Joey's<br />\ntoolbox: pliers, wrenches,<br />\nTrojans.<br />\nRosalie doesn't want to believe<br />\nthat Joey's cheating, but no one<br />\nelse seems to be fooled. Her<br />\nYugoslavian mother Nadja (Joan<br />\nPlowright) mutters in foreign<br />\ntongues whenever he walks by.<br />\nAdoring pizza chef Devo (River<br /><br />\nPhoenix) offers her his own tidbits of New Age advice.

Writer John Kostmayer<br />\ntries to make Joey a reprehensible character, one who you'd<br />\nwant to see get a little justice. But<br />\nit's forced.

People who<br />\nhave been married that long don't<br />\npreface each of their rationalizations by saying,\"Of course I act<br />\nthat way, I'm Italian!\" If<br />\nKostmayer wants us to believe<br />\nthat their relationship is that implausible, he is completely undermining Joey's ability to deceive<br />\nand Rosalie's ability to keep faith<br />\nin him.<br />\nKasdan coaxes perfect performances from Hurt and Reeves as<br />\nthe two inept murderers, although<br />\nReeves is in danger of turning his<br />\ncareer into one long \"Excellent<br />\nAdventure.\" Kline's Italian<br />\ntongue-wagging is almost exhausting to listen to.

Property damage is<br />\nthe second most frequent type of<br />\nassault.\"<br />\n\"Incidents usually have one<br />\nvictim and many perpetrators.<br />\nIt's invariably more than one person [committing the incident].<br />\nThat says something about the expressability of prejudice.\"<br /><br />\nFurthermore, he said, many<br />\nvictims\u2014up to 85%\u2014never<br />\nreport incidents. \"Gays may not<br />\nwant to 'come out'.

That<br />\nway you potentially have the best<br />\nopportunity for intergroup education, by reaching the majority of<br />\nstudents in four years.\"<br />\nBut no program will be successful without extraordinary effort and publicity. And no single<br />\nmeans of publicizing will be successful in and of itself.\"<br />\nHe also urged the group,<br />\n\"Don't conduct business as<br />\nusual.

The Blue Jay defense turned 3 double plays to stifle<br />\nCatholic's hopes of scoring.<br />\nSaid Babb,\"This was probably<br />\nour best game of the year,<br />\ndefensively\u2014maybe even our<br />\nbest all-around performance.\"<br />\nThe errorless defensive play<br />\nwas accompanied by consistent<br />\nhitting, as the Jays opened the<br />\nfirst inning with two runs and<br />\nnever looked back. Kwiterovich<br />\nhad a double and two RBI's, batting 3-for-4 for the day.

The loss<br />\nwas encouraging for the Jays<br />\nas they finished a mere six<br />\npoints behind Ursinus, the<br />\nMAC champions two years<br />\nago. Even more heartening<br />\nwas the performance of the<br />\ndistance team. Stated distance<br />\ncoach Jim Grogan,\"We were<br />\nstill in the process of training<br />\nduring that meet, so finishing<br />\nso close to a team like Ursinus<br />\nwas very encouraging.\"<br />\nNext for the Jays was the<br />\nWestern Maryland Relays,<br />\nwhich consists of approximately nine teams.

One<br />\nbright spot came out of the<br />\ncompetition as Tom Chiari<br />\nqualified tbr the MAC's in the<br />\n110 meter high hurdles.<br />\nThe Jays are looking forward to their next couple of<br />\nmeets due to the fast surfaces<br />\nand experience they will provide.

The team fell to a tough<br />\nGeorgetown squad by a score of<br />\n5-0.<br />\nThe first period of the contest<br />\nproved to be a reliable indicator<br />\nof how the whole game would be<br />\nplayed. Georgetown dominated<br />\nthe action as they outshot the Blue<br />\nJays 27-5. On offense the Hoyas<br />\nused relentless forechecking to<br />\napply suffocating pressure which<br />\nwould not allow Hopkins to get on<br />\ntrack, and which enabled<br />\nthemselves to have a number of<br />\ngood shots. Junior goaltender<br />\nDavid Bowyer stood like a rock<br />\nin the face of the onslaught,<br />\nhowever, as he successfully<br />\nthwarted all but one of<br />\nGeogetown's numerous scoring<br />\nopportunities. At the end of the<br /><br />\nperiod the Jays were still in it,<br />\ntrailing only 1-0.<br />\n\"After the first, I felt like we<br />\nwere lucky to be in it,\" said<br />\nCoach Wirth. \"But I knew that<br />\nwith the way Dave was playing<br />\nthat we only needed a few good<br />\nshots to pull out the victory.\"<br />\nHopkins proved unable to find<br />\nthose opportunities.<br />\nThe second period closely<br />\nresembled the first. Bowyer made<br />\nsave after save, but again could<br />\nnot stop them all. Two Hoya<br />\nshots found the net, and<br />\nGeorgetown took a 3-0 lead into<br />\nthe third period.<br />\nHopkins made its most determined offensive efforts in the<br />\nthird period. Despite some good<br />\nchances, Georgetown's defense<br />\nproved up to the challenge as it<br />\nturned back the Blue Jay forwards<br />\nempty handed. The Hoyas added two more goals in the period,<br />\nand despite am astonishing<br />\n50-save effort by Bowyer\u2014a<br />\nleague and team record\u2014<br /><br />\nGeorgetown captured the league<br />\nchampionship with a 5-0 victory.<br />\nIt's tough to take losing to these<br />\nguys [Georgetown] all the time,<br />\nbut I still can't complain about<br />\nour season as a whole,\" offered<br />\ncaptain Mike Holmes. Vinny Alfi<br />\nechoed the sentiment. \"If you'd<br />\nhave told me we were going to go<br />\n14-8-1 at the beginning of the<br />\nseason then I'd have said you<br />\nwere crazy. We took a young<br />\nteam without the star players<br />\nwe've had in the past, and we surpassed any goal we could've set<br />\nfor ourselves.\"<br />\nThe Jays should be as tough as<br />\never next year, but they will not<br />\nhave the services of six of the first<br />\nfour players at Hopkins. The ice<br />\nhockey team says good-bye to<br />\nVinny Alfi, Jack Calkins, Pierre<br />\nDeMatos, Brendan Dix, Mike<br />\nHolmes, and Eric Teitel, and<br />\nthanks them for their dedication<br />\nto a blossoming sport in the<br />\nBill Berger<br />\nHopkins community.<br />\nDave Bowyer excelled in goal in the Jays' championship game loss.<br /><br />\nNotes<br />\nby J.

In<br />\nhigh school, he would often practice on his own after a team<br />\nworkout. \"Back then,\" he says,<br />\n\"I worked out like a fiend and<br />\nwas in top shape.\"<br />\nComing to Hopkins was a difficult transition for him. Unlike<br />\nmany other athletes' situation, it<br />\nwasn't a step up to tougher competition; rather, it was a step<br />\ndown in his workouts. \"Here,<br />\nyou practice with the team and<br />\nthen you have to leave and do<br />\nwork, instead of working out<br />\nmore. To be honest, if academics<br />\ndidn't matter, I could have excelled further.\"<br />\nHe excelled anyway, as he<br />\nplaced in the Middle Atlantic<br />\nConference his junior and senior<br />\nyear. In addition, he has been an<br />\nAcademic All-American the past<br />\ntwo years. Part of the credit goes<br />\nto coach Andy Janquitto who<br />\ntrained the team well while being<br />\naware of academic needs and<br /><br />\npressures. \"He is a great coach,\"<br />\nsays Tim,\"and he always accomodates you if you have an<br />\nacademic conflict.\"<br />\nThe only major disappointment<br />\nof his career was during his<br />\nsophomore year as he didn't place<br />\nin the MAC. \"I was having a<br />\ngreat season,\" he recalls. \"I lost<br />\na close match early on lin the<br />\nMAC tournament] and then selfdestructed in the next match. It<br />\nwas a case of not being in as good<br />\na shape as possible. It motivated<br />\nme for next year. I realized that<br />\nyou can't go half-assed and that<br />\nyou have to have a good balance<br />\namong athletics, academics,<br />\nand extracurriculars.\"<br />\n\"Engineering is a good major<br />\nto have now,\" he says,\"and the<br />\nfaculty in the department are<br />\ngreat.\"<br />\nThe future is hazy for Tim as<br />\nhe is unsure of what he wants to<br />\ndo. His number one choice is to<br />\ngo to Japan and teach English,<br />\neven though he doesn't speak<br />\nJapanese yet.<br />\nLike many undergraduates<br />\nhere, he is concerned about<br />\nthe social aspects of Hopkins.<br />\n\"I've seen some good attempts<br />\nfrom the university to help the<br />\nsocial life, like the Faculty-Student<br />\nInteraction program here, and<br />\nI've seen some negative things,<br />\nlike the lack of a student untion<br />\nand proper housing for all<br />\nstudents. Hopkins is a great<br />\nlearning institution, but its<br />\nstudents need a social outlet. The<br />\nlack of one can lead to an<br />\nunhealthy environment.\"<br />\nBeing active is important to<br />\nTim, which is why he likes the<br />\nsize of Hopkins. \"It is small<br />\nenough that I've been able to do<br />\nwhatever I wanted to do. I've got<br />\na lot of good memories and<br />\nachievments over four years here<br />\nand I'm ready to move on with<br />\nmy life.\"<br /><br />\nDonna Williamson<br /><br />\nKevin Roller<br />\nKevin Roller is a four-year letterman in basketball and will<br />\ngraduate with a B.A. in<br />\nPolitical Science.<br />\nKevin loves the game of<br />\nbasketball.<br />\nWhether it is as a coach at a<br />\ncamp or as a player on a varsity<br />\nor as a \"shirt or skin\" in a pickup game, he loves basketball.<br />\nWhile he may not have gotten as<br />\nmuch attention for his efforts as<br />\nother players on the team have,<br />\nhe has the respect of the players<br />\nand coaches. And that is enough<br />\nfor him.<br />\nOne of two seniors on the team,<br />\nhe recalls his visit to Hopkins as<br />\na senior in high school before Bill<br />\nNelson was coach. \"There was<br />\ngood talent,\" he says.<br />\n\"However, basketball was not<br />\ntaken seriously. It was like pickup basketball.
