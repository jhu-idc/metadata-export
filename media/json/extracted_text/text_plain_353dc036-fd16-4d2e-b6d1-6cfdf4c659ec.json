At present<br />\nit is not known whether the actual<br />\nmoving will take place before or<br />\nafter the session of the summer<br />\nschool, but in all probability the<br />\nclasses in the summer school will<br />\nbe held in McCoy Hall.<br />\nAll the departments, with the exception of that of chemistry, will<br />\nbe at Homewood by October, 1916.<br />\nAll plans for the chemical laboratory are complete, but the University has not the money at present<br />\nto erect a building as expensive as<br />\nthe proposed laboratory. Estimates<br />\nwere called for on this building, and<br />\nthe bid most seriously considered<br />\nwas for a $300,000 structure, but<br />\nlast Monday it was learned that<br />\nthe University had not accepted this<br />\nbid.<br />\nAs the plans now stand, Gilman<br />\nHall will house all the departments<br />\nthat are now in McCoy Hall, and,<br />\nin addition, the biology laboratory<br />\nand the psychology department.<br />\nBiology will occupy a large part of<br />\nthe basement of Gilman Hall, and<br />\npsychology will have the top floor.<br />\nThe present Engineering Building will contain the electrical and<br />\nmechanical engineering departments<br />\nand also the physical laboratory.<br />\nCivil engineering, now in the Engineering Building, will, by next<br />\nfall, have a building of its own.<br />\nWork has been actively started on<br />\nthe new home of the civil engineers. The new Civil Engineering<br />\nBuilding will also have the geology<br />\nlaboratory until this department<br />\ngets a building of its own.<br />\nIt would be impossible to move<br />\nthe chemistry laboratory into any<br />\nof the other buildings at Homewood: so much special apparatus is<br />\nrequired that the proposition would<br />\nbe exceedingly expensive. About<br />\none-third of the expense of a new<br />\nchemistry building would be put<br />\ninto specially constructed apparatus<br />\nand fixtures. Dr. A. R. L. Dohme<br />\nhas offered, if several others will<br />\nassist him, to underwrite the interest for five years on a loan for the<br />\nerection of a new chemistry laboratory, but as yet no others have<br />\nshown an inclination to help Dr.<br />\nDohme in his generous offer.<br />\nPresident Goodnow has talked<br />\nwith Mayor Preston concerning the<br />\npurchase by the city of McCoy Hall<br />\nand the geological, chemical and<br />\nbiological laboratories as an addition to the overcrowded City College.

The students will form in regular order,<br />\naccording to classes, at McCoy Hall<br />\non Saturday at 1.30 P. M., and<br />\nwill proceed according to plans<br />\nwhich have not as yet been announced to the athletic field at<br />\nHomewood.<br />\nAn effort will be made to obtain<br />\npermission from the city authorities<br />\nto have a steam roller at the head<br />\nof the procession and it is planned<br />\nto have a goat, suitably decorated,<br />\nto accompany the leaders of the<br />\nparade. The students will wear<br />\nregulation caps, in black and blue,<br />\nwhich will be obtainable from the<br />\nAthletic Association before the day<br />\nof the game. A full band will play<br />\nat the head of the parade during<br />\nthe entire march. Class flags, alumni banners and all manner of decoration will be in evidence and no<br />\neffort will be spared to make the<br />\neffect as complete as possible.<br />\nA canvass of the entire University is being made to secure funds<br />\nto pay for the band and every student is expected to contribute fifty<br />\ncents. Representative members of<br />\nthe four classes have been appointed<br />\nto collect the money, and all students are urged to hand in their<br />\ncontributions as soon as possible, in<br />\norder to facilitate the work of the<br />\ncommittees.<br />\nSince the time of the game has<br />\nbeen set at 2.30 P. M., it has been<br />\nthought advisable to start the93,arade<br />\nat least an hour before that time,<br />\nin order to allow plenty of time for<br />\nan adequate demonstration. Participants are especially requested to<br />\nbe on hand at least fifteen minutes<br />\nahead of time, so that all arrangements may be successfully carried<br />\nout.<br />\n<br />\nBy COACH CHARLES E. BRICKLEY<br />\n<br />\nThe Black and Blue eleven met<br />\ndefeat in its game with Haverford<br />\nSaturday, the score being 14 to 10.<br />\nHopkins started by playing the<br />\nPennsylvanians off their feet during the first quarter and scored ten<br />\nPoints, but the enemy came back in<br />\nthe latter part of the contest, holding the 'Varsity scoreless and gaining two touchdowns.<br />\nAfter the first kick-off, punts<br />\nwere exchanged, and Hoffman and<br />\nBrooks carried the ball in a series<br />\nof runs to the 5-yard line, from<br />\nWhich point Brooks carried it over<br />\nafter three attempts through Haverford's line. Wilkinson kicked goal.<br />\nBrooks again figured in the scoring in this quarter, carrying the ball<br />\non a 45-yard run to the 30-yard line,<br />\nfrom which Hoffman kicked goal.<br />\nThere was no more scoring in the<br />\nquarter.<br />\nIn the second period Haverford,<br />\nhaving the wind at its back, got the<br />\nbetter of the punting and scored a<br />\ntouchdown from an on-side kick.<br />\nA disagreement arose as to the<br />\nvalidity of the play which .resulted<br />\nin this score. It was contended by<br />\nthe Black and Blue that the backfield was off-side at the time of the<br />\nkick and was hence ineligible to recover the ball. However, the officials allowed the touchdown to<br />\ncount. The Hopkins men allowed<br />\nthe ball to roll, without touching it,<br />\nover the goal for what they believed<br />\nwas a touchback, and were very<br />\nmuch disappointed to find that the<br />\nofficials decided to allow the score<br />\nto count.<br />\nIn the remainder of the first half<br />\nlittle was gained by either side.<br />\nBowers ran a punt through a broken<br />\nfield in a<br />\nhair-raising manner for<br />\nthirty-five yards, but the ball was<br />\ncalled back by the officials, who penalized the Black and Blue for holding. No more scoring was done in<br />\nthis period.<br />\nIn the next period, Haverford \u201e<br />\nstarted out with different tactics,<br />\nusing the forward pass to advantage<br />\nfor a while,<br />\nbut finally resorting to<br />\nkicking after Hopkins had broken<br />\nUp several<br />\nplays, and Darley<br />\ndropped a<br />\npunt on the 8-yard line<br />\nWhich was recovered by Van Dam<br />\nand carried over<br />\nfor Haverford's<br />\nsecond touchdown.<br />\nThe fourth quarter brought forth<br />\nno especial gain for either side.<br />\nForward passing was used throughout the period, but the ball remained<br />\nabout in midfield most of the time.<br />\nThe stars of the game were Hoffman and Brooks for Hopkins and<br />\nVan Dam and Moon for Haverford.<br />\nSchmidt and Ormond also excelled<br />\n(C9ntinued on page 8, col.- 2)<br />\n<br />\nThe game with Haverford was a<br />\nheart-breaking affair, both, from the<br />\nstandpoint of the players and<br />\ncoaches. The teams were evenly<br />\nmatched, and the contest would<br />\nhave been a wonder to watch had it<br />\nnot been for the poor work of the<br />\nofficials.<br />\nNever in all my experience in<br />\nfootball have I seen a game conducted as poorly as on Saturday.<br />\nAnd the unfortunate part of it all<br />\nwas that the great majority of the<br />\npoor decisions counted against Hopkins\u2014one of them resulting directly<br />\nin a touchdown on a so-called onside kick. The referee in particular was at fault time and again, and<br />\nit always seemed that Hopkins was<br />\nthe team to suffer. There is certainly no disgrace in losing a football game to a team which plays<br />\nbetter football, and I should have<br />\nnothing but praise for our opponents if they outplayed us and won,<br />\nbut I really feel that if the officials<br />\nhad given us half a chance we<br />\nwould have come out on top.<br />\nOne of the most gratifying features of the game, from the coaches'<br />\nstandpoint, was the improvement in<br />\ninterference on the part of Hopkins.<br />\nFor the first time this season opponents were really taken out of<br />\nthe play. But even a greater improvement must be made if we are<br />\nto defeat St. John's and Maryland<br />\nAgricultural College.<br />\nThe tackling on the part of Hopkins was very good. The men<br />\ntackled hard and clean, and there<br />\nwere few missed tackles. The work<br />\nof the secondary defense was especially good in this respect. Haverford had a varied open attack which<br />\nwas not easy to solve.<br />\nThe breaks of the game nearly<br />\nall went to Haverford. Credit<br />\nshould be given to them for taking<br />\nadvantage of them. Hopkins is still<br />\nOf all the students at Princeton slow to take advantage of its opUniversity, some 250,br 15 per cent. portunities. In a close game it is<br />\nof the entire body, are working the team that takes advantage of<br />\nwholly or partially their way its few chances to score that wins.<br />\nthrough college.

The Glee Club has had several rehearsals, and although the attendance at some was not encouraging, those last held were as successful as the usual run of beginning<br />\nmeetings. A large number of new<br />\nmen are out for the club, and from<br />\nnow on the work of the leader will<br />\nconsist largely of picking out the<br />\nmost likely candidates. All students who have in mind trying out<br />\nfor the club should report at once,<br />\nwhile there is yet an opportunity<br />\nto catch up with the work.<br />\nThe Instrumental Club began its<br />\nwork with a good rehearsal on Friday night. The men from last<br />\nyear's clubs were out in full force,<br />\nbut few new candidates presented<br />\nthemselves. The management desires to announce that since the<br />\nwork of the Instrumental Club goes<br />\nalong very rapidly, all candidates<br />\nwho have not as yet reported should<br />\ndo so at the next rehearsal, in order<br />\nto get in line before it becomes too<br />\nlate. Flute, 'cello and clarinet players are especially needed.<br />\nPlans for a very full schedule are<br />\nbeing worked out by the management. The season will begin with<br />\nthe first week in January and will<br />\nextend to the week after Easter,<br />\ntaking in a large number of engagements in and about Baltimore, as<br />\nwell as two or three trips of moderate length.

The speaker was Dr.<br />\nFrederick Howe, Commissioner of<br />\nImmigration of New York, whose<br />\nsubject was \"The Incoming Alien:<br />\nA Problem and a Program.\" Dr.<br />\nHowe has made a special study of<br />\nmunicipal government both in this<br />\ncountry and abroad and has given<br />\nespecially close attention to the immigrant as a factor in city life. He<br />\nis a graduate of Hopkins, his thesis<br />\nbeing \"A Study of Internal Revenue Taxation in the United States.\"<br />\nAfter leaving Baltimore, he studied<br />\nand practiced law in both New<br />\nYork and Cleveland. Dr. Howe has<br />\nwritten for the magazines and has<br />\npublished a number of books\u2014the<br />\nbest known being \"The City: The<br />\nHope of Democracy.\"<br />\nAccording to Dr. Howe, just<br />\nwhat problems of immigration this<br />\ncountry will have to face no man<br />\nknows. \"There may be very little<br />\nimmigration after the war; there<br />\nmay be a great deal. Opinions differ. European countries may close<br />\nthe doors to the outgoing alien, for<br />\nhe will be badly needed at home in<br />\nthe work of reconstruction; or they<br />\nmay encourage the emigration of<br />\nwomen and children and the wreckage of the war. Emigration to<br />\nAmerica will depend upon the economic conditions in Europe on the<br />\none hand and in America on the,<br />\nother.\" Then discussing the necessary assimilation of the foreigner,<br />\nhe said: -As to whether immigration is a problem or not depends<br />\nupon our attitude toward it. If we<br />\nexert ourselves to protect the immigrant, to educate and assimilate him,<br />\nto find him employment, especially<br />\nto place him upon the land, the<br />\nmelting-pot of America will assimilate him in the future as it has in<br />\nthe past.-<br />\n<br />\nThe University Young Men's<br />\nChristian *Association gave a luncheon in Levering Hall on Friday to<br />\nthe students of the University. Mr.<br />\nC. D. Hursey, who is the Young<br />\nMen's Christian Association Secretary on Friendly Relations Among<br />\nForeign Students, delivered an excellent address to a large number<br />\nof students.<br />\nThe attendance was very gratifying to the officers of the Association and was doubtless responsible<br />\nin a large measure for the announcement that such a luncheon<br />\nwill probably be given every month.<br />\nThe Association feels that such<br />\nmeetings should serve a very worthy<br />\npurpose, in that not only a muchneeded social gathering is afforded<br />\nto the students, but an opportunity<br />\nis also given to hear attractive and<br />\nhelpful talks by prominent men interested in the Young Men's Christian Association work at large.<br />\nChapel services, which were held<br />\nlast week under the leadership of<br />\nDr. Elbert Russell, were unusually<br />\nwell attended. Dr. Russell, who is<br />\na member of the faculty of the University, gave some very inspiring<br />\ntalks. The services this week are<br />\nbeing led by 'Air. Eugene Levering,<br />\nthe president of the National Bank<br />\nof Commerce of this city. The<br />\nofficers of the Association anticipate<br />\nan attendance which will surpass<br />\nall previous figures. This assumption does not seem at all unreasonable when it is remembered that<br />\nAiIr. Levering has always displayed<br />\nan active and never-failing interest<br />\nin the affairs of the University. He<br />\nis a very interesting speaker and it<br />\nis expected that every student will<br />\nwant to hear and express his appreciation to the man who erected the<br />\nbuilding which now bears his name<br />\nand from which the students derive<br />\nso many benefits.<br />\nThe various Bible study classes<br />\nhave been holding their weekly<br />\nmeetings and the work is progressing rapidly. Both the enrollment<br />\nand attendance at these classes have<br />\nbeen abnormally large this year.<br />\nThis fact is the source of great encouragement to the officers of the<br />\nAssociation. However, they wish<br />\nto announce that it is not too late<br />\nyet to enroll in any one of the four<br />\nclasses.

However, it is reasonable to believe that<br />\nDr. Wood will have some highly interesting and possibly wonderful<br />\ndiscoveries to present to the University.<br />\nBank Cashier\u2014This check, madam, isn't filled in.<br />\nMadam\u2014Isn't what?<br />\nBank Cashier\u2014It has your husband's name signed to it, but it does<br />\nnot state how much money you<br />\nwant.<br />\nMadam\u2014Oh, is that all?

B.

This was all<br />\nthe more remarkable in view of the<br />\nfact that this distinction was attained after only two years at Oxford. Mr. Niles is planning to take<br />\nthe B. C.

Estimates<br />\nwere called for on this building, and<br />\nthe bid most seriously considered<br />\nwas for a $300,000 structure, but<br />\nlast Monday it was learned that<br />\nthe University had not accepted this<br />\nbid.<br />\nAs the plans now stand, Gilman<br />\nHall will house all the departments<br />\nthat are now in McCoy Hall, and,<br />\nin addition, the biology laboratory<br />\nand the psychology department.<br />\nBiology will occupy a large part of<br />\nthe basement of Gilman Hall, and<br />\npsychology will have the top floor.<br />\nThe present Engineering Building will contain the electrical and<br />\nmechanical engineering departments<br />\nand also the physical laboratory.<br />\nCivil engineering, now in the Engineering Building, will, by next<br />\nfall, have a building of its own.<br />\nWork has been actively started on<br />\nthe new home of the civil engineers. The new Civil Engineering<br />\nBuilding will also have the geology<br />\nlaboratory until this department<br />\ngets a building of its own.<br />\nIt would be impossible to move<br />\nthe chemistry laboratory into any<br />\nof the other buildings at Homewood: so much special apparatus is<br />\nrequired that the proposition would<br />\nbe exceedingly expensive. About<br />\none-third of the expense of a new<br />\nchemistry building would be put<br />\ninto specially constructed apparatus<br />\nand fixtures. Dr. A. R. L. Dohme<br />\nhas offered, if several others will<br />\nassist him, to underwrite the interest for five years on a loan for the<br />\nerection of a new chemistry laboratory, but as yet no others have<br />\nshown an inclination to help Dr.<br />\nDohme in his generous offer.<br />\nPresident Goodnow has talked<br />\nwith Mayor Preston concerning the<br />\npurchase by the city of McCoy Hall<br />\nand the geological, chemical and<br />\nbiological laboratories as an addition to the overcrowded City College. If the-University makes such<br />\na sale the present physical laboratory will be used for a chemistry la-<br /><br />\nFor the first time since the memorable season of 1912, a monster<br />\nparade of the undergraduate students will be held before the football game with St. John's. The students will form in regular order,<br />\naccording to classes, at McCoy Hall<br />\non Saturday at 1.30 P. M., and<br />\nwill proceed according to plans<br />\nwhich have not as yet been announced to the athletic field at<br />\nHomewood.<br />\nAn effort will be made to obtain<br />\npermission from the city authorities<br />\nto have a steam roller at the head<br />\nof the procession and it is planned<br />\nto have a goat, suitably decorated,<br />\nto accompany the leaders of the<br />\nparade. The students will wear<br />\nregulation caps, in black and blue,<br />\nwhich will be obtainable from the<br />\nAthletic Association before the day<br />\nof the game. A full band will play<br />\nat the head of the parade during<br />\nthe entire march. Class flags, alumni banners and all manner of decoration will be in evidence and no<br />\neffort will be spared to make the<br />\neffect as complete as possible.<br />\nA canvass of the entire University is being made to secure funds<br />\nto pay for the band and every student is expected to contribute fifty<br />\ncents. Representative members of<br />\nthe four classes have been appointed<br />\nto collect the money, and all students are urged to hand in their<br />\ncontributions as soon as possible, in<br />\norder to facilitate the work of the<br />\ncommittees.<br />\nSince the time of the game has<br />\nbeen set at 2.30 P. M., it has been<br />\nthought advisable to start the93,arade<br />\nat least an hour before that time,<br />\nin order to allow plenty of time for<br />\nan adequate demonstration. Participants are especially requested to<br />\nbe on hand at least fifteen minutes<br />\nahead of time, so that all arrangements may be successfully carried<br />\nout.<br /><br />\nBy COACH CHARLES E. BRICKLEY<br /><br />\nThe Black and Blue eleven met<br />\ndefeat in its game with Haverford<br />\nSaturday, the score being 14 to 10.<br />\nHopkins started by playing the<br />\nPennsylvanians off their feet during the first quarter and scored ten<br />\nPoints, but the enemy came back in<br />\nthe latter part of the contest, holding the 'Varsity scoreless and gaining two touchdowns.<br />\nAfter the first kick-off, punts<br />\nwere exchanged, and Hoffman and<br />\nBrooks carried the ball in a series<br />\nof runs to the 5-yard line, from<br />\nWhich point Brooks carried it over<br />\nafter three attempts through Haverford's line. Wilkinson kicked goal.<br />\nBrooks again figured in the scoring in this quarter, carrying the ball<br />\non a 45-yard run to the 30-yard line,<br />\nfrom which Hoffman kicked goal.<br />\nThere was no more scoring in the<br />\nquarter.<br />\nIn the second period Haverford,<br />\nhaving the wind at its back, got the<br />\nbetter of the punting and scored a<br />\ntouchdown from an on-side kick.<br />\nA disagreement arose as to the<br />\nvalidity of the play which .resulted<br />\nin this score. It was contended by<br />\nthe Black and Blue that the backfield was off-side at the time of the<br />\nkick and was hence ineligible to recover the ball. However, the officials allowed the touchdown to<br />\ncount. The Hopkins men allowed<br />\nthe ball to roll, without touching it,<br />\nover the goal for what they believed<br />\nwas a touchback, and were very<br />\nmuch disappointed to find that the<br />\nofficials decided to allow the score<br />\nto count.<br />\nIn the remainder of the first half<br />\nlittle was gained by either side.<br />\nBowers ran a punt through a broken<br />\nfield in a<br />\nhair-raising manner for<br />\nthirty-five yards, but the ball was<br />\ncalled back by the officials, who penalized the Black and Blue for holding. No more scoring was done in<br />\nthis period.<br />\nIn the next period, Haverford \u201e<br />\nstarted out with different tactics,<br />\nusing the forward pass to advantage<br />\nfor a while,<br />\nbut finally resorting to<br />\nkicking after Hopkins had broken<br />\nUp several<br />\nplays, and Darley<br />\ndropped a<br />\npunt on the 8-yard line<br />\nWhich was recovered by Van Dam<br />\nand carried over<br />\nfor Haverford's<br />\nsecond touchdown.<br />\nThe fourth quarter brought forth<br />\nno especial gain for either side.<br />\nForward passing was used throughout the period, but the ball remained<br />\nabout in midfield most of the time.<br />\nThe stars of the game were Hoffman and Brooks for Hopkins and<br />\nVan Dam and Moon for Haverford.<br />\nSchmidt and Ormond also excelled<br />\n(C9ntinued on page 8, col.- 2)<br /><br />\nThe game with Haverford was a<br />\nheart-breaking affair, both, from the<br />\nstandpoint of the players and<br />\ncoaches. The teams were evenly<br />\nmatched, and the contest would<br />\nhave been a wonder to watch had it<br />\nnot been for the poor work of the<br />\nofficials.<br />\nNever in all my experience in<br />\nfootball have I seen a game conducted as poorly as on Saturday.<br />\nAnd the unfortunate part of it all<br />\nwas that the great majority of the<br />\npoor decisions counted against Hopkins\u2014one of them resulting directly<br />\nin a touchdown on a so-called onside kick. The referee in particular was at fault time and again, and<br />\nit always seemed that Hopkins was<br />\nthe team to suffer. There is certainly no disgrace in losing a football game to a team which plays<br />\nbetter football, and I should have<br />\nnothing but praise for our opponents if they outplayed us and won,<br />\nbut I really feel that if the officials<br />\nhad given us half a chance we<br />\nwould have come out on top.<br />\nOne of the most gratifying features of the game, from the coaches'<br />\nstandpoint, was the improvement in<br />\ninterference on the part of Hopkins.<br />\nFor the first time this season opponents were really taken out of<br />\nthe play. But even a greater improvement must be made if we are<br />\nto defeat St. John's and Maryland<br />\nAgricultural College.<br />\nThe tackling on the part of Hopkins was very good. The men<br />\ntackled hard and clean, and there<br />\nwere few missed tackles. The work<br />\nof the secondary defense was especially good in this respect. Haverford had a varied open attack which<br />\nwas not easy to solve.<br />\nThe breaks of the game nearly<br />\nall went to Haverford. Credit<br />\nshould be given to them for taking<br />\nadvantage of them. Hopkins is still<br />\nOf all the students at Princeton slow to take advantage of its opUniversity, some 250,br 15 per cent. portunities.

The Glee Club has had several rehearsals, and although the attendance at some was not encouraging, those last held were as successful as the usual run of beginning<br />\nmeetings. A large number of new<br />\nmen are out for the club, and from<br />\nnow on the work of the leader will<br />\nconsist largely of picking out the<br />\nmost likely candidates. All students who have in mind trying out<br />\nfor the club should report at once,<br />\nwhile there is yet an opportunity<br />\nto catch up with the work.<br />\nThe Instrumental Club began its<br />\nwork with a good rehearsal on Friday night. The men from last<br />\nyear's clubs were out in full force,<br />\nbut few new candidates presented<br />\nthemselves. The management desires to announce that since the<br />\nwork of the Instrumental Club goes<br />\nalong very rapidly, all candidates<br />\nwho have not as yet reported should<br />\ndo so at the next rehearsal, in order<br />\nto get in line before it becomes too<br />\nlate. Flute, 'cello and clarinet players are especially needed.<br />\nPlans for a very full schedule are<br />\nbeing worked out by the management. The season will begin with<br />\nthe first week in January and will<br />\nextend to the week after Easter,<br />\ntaking in a large number of engagements in and about Baltimore, as<br />\nwell as two or three trips of moderate length. Attention is again being called to the fact that outside<br />\nassistance in the work of arranging<br />\ntrips is desired by the management,<br />\nand that five dollars will be paid<br />\nany student who works up acceptable plans for a trip.<br />\nThe annual McCoy Hall concert<br />\nwill be held in the latter part of<br />\nFebruary. The exact date has not<br />\nyet been set, but will be chosen from<br />\nthe latter two Friday nights\u2014the<br />\neighteenth and the twenty-fifth.<br />\nEspecial attention will be paid the<br />\nwork on this concert, and a particular effort will be made to enlist the<br />\nsupport of the undergraduates and<br />\nalumni to a greater degree than has<br />\nbeen attained in former years.<br />\nThe management wishes to call<br />\nthe attention of the undergraduate<br />\nstudents to the fact that they are<br />\nall eligible to membership in the<br />\nclubs, and need not try out for<br />\neither team in order to partake of<br />\nthe other benefits of membership.<br />\nAny student may, upon payment of<br />\nthe regular dues, receive a membership card which will admit him to<br />\nall the concerts of the season and<br />\nentitle him to a share in the division<br />\nof the balance in the treasury at the<br />\nend of the year.<br /><br />\nThe second in the series of lectures given under the joint auspices<br />\nof the University, the Woman's<br />\nCivic League and the Municipal<br />\nArt Society was delivered last<br />\nThursday afternoon in the Academy of Music. The speaker was Dr.<br />\nFrederick Howe, Commissioner of<br />\nImmigration of New York, whose<br />\nsubject was \"The Incoming Alien:<br />\nA Problem and a Program.\" Dr.<br />\nHowe has made a special study of<br />\nmunicipal government both in this<br />\ncountry and abroad and has given<br />\nespecially close attention to the immigrant as a factor in city life. He<br />\nis a graduate of Hopkins, his thesis<br />\nbeing \"A Study of Internal Revenue Taxation in the United States.\"<br />\nAfter leaving Baltimore, he studied<br />\nand practiced law in both New<br />\nYork and Cleveland. Dr. Howe has<br />\nwritten for the magazines and has<br />\npublished a number of books\u2014the<br />\nbest known being \"The City: The<br />\nHope of Democracy.\"<br />\nAccording to Dr. Howe, just<br />\nwhat problems of immigration this<br />\ncountry will have to face no man<br />\nknows. \"There may be very little<br />\nimmigration after the war; there<br />\nmay be a great deal. Opinions differ. European countries may close<br />\nthe doors to the outgoing alien, for<br />\nhe will be badly needed at home in<br />\nthe work of reconstruction; or they<br />\nmay encourage the emigration of<br />\nwomen and children and the wreckage of the war. Emigration to<br />\nAmerica will depend upon the economic conditions in Europe on the<br />\none hand and in America on the,<br />\nother.\" Then discussing the necessary assimilation of the foreigner,<br />\nhe said: -As to whether immigration is a problem or not depends<br />\nupon our attitude toward it. If we<br />\nexert ourselves to protect the immigrant, to educate and assimilate him,<br />\nto find him employment, especially<br />\nto place him upon the land, the<br />\nmelting-pot of America will assimilate him in the future as it has in<br />\nthe past.-<br /><br />\nThe University Young Men's<br />\nChristian *Association gave a luncheon in Levering Hall on Friday to<br />\nthe students of the University. Mr.<br />\nC. D. Hursey, who is the Young<br />\nMen's Christian Association Secretary on Friendly Relations Among<br />\nForeign Students, delivered an excellent address to a large number<br />\nof students.<br />\nThe attendance was very gratifying to the officers of the Association and was doubtless responsible<br />\nin a large measure for the announcement that such a luncheon<br />\nwill probably be given every month.<br />\nThe Association feels that such<br />\nmeetings should serve a very worthy<br />\npurpose, in that not only a muchneeded social gathering is afforded<br />\nto the students, but an opportunity<br />\nis also given to hear attractive and<br />\nhelpful talks by prominent men interested in the Young Men's Christian Association work at large.<br />\nChapel services, which were held<br />\nlast week under the leadership of<br />\nDr. Elbert Russell, were unusually<br />\nwell attended. Dr. Russell, who is<br />\na member of the faculty of the University, gave some very inspiring<br />\ntalks. The services this week are<br />\nbeing led by 'Air. Eugene Levering,<br />\nthe president of the National Bank<br />\nof Commerce of this city. The<br />\nofficers of the Association anticipate<br />\nan attendance which will surpass<br />\nall previous figures. This assumption does not seem at all unreasonable when it is remembered that<br />\nAiIr. Levering has always displayed<br />\nan active and never-failing interest<br />\nin the affairs of the University. He<br />\nis a very interesting speaker and it<br />\nis expected that every student will<br />\nwant to hear and express his appreciation to the man who erected the<br />\nbuilding which now bears his name<br />\nand from which the students derive<br />\nso many benefits.<br />\nThe various Bible study classes<br />\nhave been holding their weekly<br />\nmeetings and the work is progressing rapidly. Both the enrollment<br />\nand attendance at these classes have<br />\nbeen abnormally large this year.<br />\nThis fact is the source of great encouragement to the officers of the<br />\nAssociation. However, they wish<br />\nto announce that it is not too late<br />\nyet to enroll in any one of the four<br />\nclasses.

It came<br />\ntoo late to be announced in THE<br />\nNEWS-LITTER last year, and there<br />\nmay be quite a number of people<br />\nwho have not yet heard of it, for I<br />\nhave not heard of its having been<br />\npublished in any of the daily papers.<br />\nI therefore ask you for space<br />\nenough to say that Mr. Emory H.<br />\nNiles, A. B. '13, senior Maryland<br />\nRhodes scholar at Oxford, England.<br />\nwas awarded a \"first class\" in the<br />\nOxford Law Schools last June, the<br />\nhighest mark to which it is possible for him to attain. This was all<br />\nthe more remarkable in view of the<br />\nfact that this distinction was attained after only two years at Oxford. Mr. Niles is planning to take<br />\nthe B. C. L. degree after his third<br />\nyear's work and I feel sure that his<br />\nfriends at Hopkins will be glad to<br />\nknow of his success in the past and<br />\nto wish him a continuance of it in<br />\nthe future.<br />\nCARL, J.
