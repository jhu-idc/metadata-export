(Examples: sacking the ROTC<br />\nbuilding, some events at fraternity houses, the \"brawl\"<br />\naspects of some of the gym dances).<br />\nThe solution suggested to us might be summed up descriptively as \"moral suasion.\" Someone is, let us say, very<br />\noffensively and actively blotto at one of the rush dances.<br />\nThings are going rapidly downhill. It is then the obligation<br />\nof any nearby Student Council member to approach, and<br />\nattempt to ameliorate the situation, possibly by \u2022pointing<br />\nout that this is conduct prejudicial to the good name of a<br />\n\"select community of gentlemen and scholars.\"<br />\nYet it seems to us that it is in the true meaning of this<br />\nphrase that the heart of the paradox lies. The Hopkins man<br />\nis \"select,\" all right, but only intellectually select; otherwise, he comes from a thousand different environments, each<br />\nwith its own shade of thinking conduct-wise, each drawing<br />\nthe line at a different place. Some of us don't drink, others<br />\nstop at the happy stage, others foggily call for tomato juice<br />\nthe next morning. And in such a diversified milieu, who is<br />\nto say that any approach is wrong? If there are no stated<br />\nlimitations, isn't judging our conduct our business?<br />\n<br />\nNEWS-LETTER<br />\n<br />\nDormitory Psychiatrist Views<br />\nStudent Mental Disturbances<br />\n\"The majority of the People<br />\nwho come here to me are not<br />\npsychologically unhealthy.

Hampson, assistant<br />\nprofessor of psychiatry at\u2022 the<br />\nJohns Hopkins Medical School,<br />\nexplained his function as psychiatric consultant of The University.<br />\nDr. Hampson interviews his<br />\nvisitors in a comfortably furnished room in the suite in the new<br />\ndormitory which encompasses the<br />\nStudent Health Service. The most<br />\nstriking feature in an otherwise<br />\ncalm and quiet atmosphere is a<br />\nvividly painted landscape, framed<br />\nmodernly in a material which<br />\nlooks like soundproofing, which<br />\nseems to fairly burst out of<br />\nframe.<br />\nThe psychiatrist explaine d,<br />\n\"Problems of the people who visit<br />\nme could all be boiled down to<br />\ndifficulties in inter-personal relationships....

Before that, Dean<br />\nShaffer's graduate students in<br />\npsychology took over some of this;<br />\nbut, still being students, they did<br />\nnot feel that it was the kind of<br />\nresponsibility for which they were<br />\nready or should carry out.

When he dumps<br />\npaint on the ODK monument? Is this just good collegiate fun<br />\n\u2014$200 worth? We don't pass judgment; we merely wonder<br />\nif, had a campus leader found the painters at work, he<br />\nwould have, been motivated to intervene, especially if he<br />\nECO-GOURMETNOMICS<br />\nwere personally acquainted with them.<br />\nDear Gentlemen:<br />\nLet us engage in a serious culiBut the real poser in our quoted phrase is that \"select nary discussion.<br />\ncommunity\"; for it is open, we think, to serious doubt, The key to the food system here<br />\nwhether this is, in the true sense, a \"community.\" Boosters at Hopkins is the Food Director,<br />\nand suchlike have for years bewailed the lack of \"spirit\" and we think that we would be<br />\nhere; (Spirit being, in their sense, nothing more or less satisfied if he did a good job;<br />\nthan group enthusiasm) and it seems to us that the more but would we?

The problem is not one of<br />\ninnate ability but has to do more<br />\nwith problems in the person's own<br />\npsychologic functioning. I don't<br />\nmeet too many of these. ... Student advisers encounter this more<br />\nfrequently.<br />\n\"The advising system as worked<br />\nhere works out just about as well<br />\nas it could. The advisers here are<br />\nbusy faculty members, and they<br />\n<br />\nPhoto by Ginnis<br />\n<br />\nDR. JOHN L. HAMPSON<br />\nhave their work to do. ... (But)<br />\nthere's not enough communication between student and adviser.<br />\nSome students seem to go along<br />\nand not get 'clued in' until they<br />\nget the axe.\"<br />\nSex Problems<br />\nThe doctor interrupted himself.<br />\n\"You haven't asked me about sex.<br />\nIt's not nearly as frequent a<br />\nproblem as you'd think it would<br />\nbe. It's not that sex and sex problems are not important but they<br />\nfit in ... in a different way from<br />\nthe way that they did 100 years<br />\n<br />\nCorrespondence<br />\n<br />\nOf course this is not the whole story. The people we are<br />\nwith have an important influence on our actions; the trouble<br />\nis, group pressure can work both ways, depending on the<br />\nsituation at the moment. Another point: the campus leaders who are to do the \"persuading\" we have mentioned, are<br />\nleaders because of their disinclination to be a bastard about<br />\nthings. (There is an old News-Letter proverb: \"Nice guys<br />\nfinish last\u2014except when entry representatives are being<br />\nelected.\") The phrase \"knock it off\" carries a certain stigma,<br />\neven among gentlemen and scholars.<br />\nWhat it boils down to is this: \"moral suasion\" can<br />\nwork\u2014indeed, already does work\u2014up to a point; but it is<br />\nas optimistic as it is unfair, in a situation where the standards are left to the individual, to expect it to obviate all<br />\nbad publicity for the University, even with all the good<br />\nwill in the world. If the Hopkins man is to be left free<br />\nto develop, it must be expected that there will be development at all levels.<br />\n<br />\nThe quickest and most obvious<br />\nway to do this is to make money.<br />\nThis makes people, especially his<br />\nboss, think he is EFFICIENT. Who<br />\nwould suspect that it is not efficiency, but done at the expense of<br />\nthe quality of the food? However,<br />\nif he does just make ends meet,<br />\nis there any reason to believe that<br />\nhe is inefficient or that the quality<br />\nof the food is higher? In other<br />\nwords, he may make money with<br />\ngood food or bad food; and he<br />\nmay have good food and make or<br />\nnot make money. Also, he may<br />\nmake money and be efficient or'<br />\nnot efficient, and he may be efficient and make or not make<br />\nmoney.<br />\nThe reason this paradox exists<br />\nis because these terms and standards are without meaning in the<br />\n<br />\npresent situation. They are without meaning because we do not<br />\nhave free consumer choice.

But most<br />\npeople agree that there are differences, especially in time sequence.Research work comes first, because one of its main objectives is to establish or discover new scientific facts that will<br />\nsupply the foundation for new industrial developments. In<br />\nother .words, research men seek new knowledge about matter, generally working with small quantities of it.<br />\nDevelopment work comes later, and Du Pout has two main<br />\ntypes. First, there is new process development. Here scientists<br />\nand engineers modify, streamline, and augment the findings<br />\nof research so that new chemical products can be profitably<br />\nmade on a large scale\u2014or existing products can be made by<br />\nnewer and more efficient methods. Pilot-plant and semi-works<br />\noperations are usually included under this heading.<br />\nSecond, an important kind of development work is directed<br />\ntoward improvement of existing processes and products. Here<br />\nthe men study how to obtain yield increases, utilize by-products,increase outputs,and solve sales service problems as they<br />\narise. This may require considerable research, and that brings<br />\nus back to the overlapping I previously mentioned.<br />\nThere are genuine differences, John, but a good deal of<br />\nsimilarity,too\u2014especiallyin the constant need for imagination<br />\nand creative effort.

(Examples: sacking the ROTC<br />\nbuilding, some events at fraternity houses, the \"brawl\"<br />\naspects of some of the gym dances).<br />\nThe solution suggested to us might be summed up descriptively as \"moral suasion.\" Someone is, let us say, very<br />\noffensively and actively blotto at one of the rush dances.<br />\nThings are going rapidly downhill. It is then the obligation<br />\nof any nearby Student Council member to approach, and<br />\nattempt to ameliorate the situation, possibly by \u2022pointing<br />\nout that this is conduct prejudicial to the good name of a<br />\n\"select community of gentlemen and scholars.\"<br />\nYet it seems to us that it is in the true meaning of this<br />\nphrase that the heart of the paradox lies. The Hopkins man<br />\nis \"select,\" all right, but only intellectually select; otherwise, he comes from a thousand different environments, each<br />\nwith its own shade of thinking conduct-wise, each drawing<br />\nthe line at a different place. Some of us don't drink, others<br />\nstop at the happy stage, others foggily call for tomato juice<br />\nthe next morning. And in such a diversified milieu, who is<br />\nto say that any approach is wrong? If there are no stated<br />\nlimitations, isn't judging our conduct our business?<br /><br />\nNEWS-LETTER<br /><br />\nDormitory Psychiatrist Views<br />\nStudent Mental Disturbances<br />\n\"The majority of the People<br />\nwho come here to me are not<br />\npsychologically unhealthy.

The problem is not one of<br />\ninnate ability but has to do more<br />\nwith problems in the person's own<br />\npsychologic functioning. I don't<br />\nmeet too many of these. ... Student advisers encounter this more<br />\nfrequently.<br />\n\"The advising system as worked<br />\nhere works out just about as well<br />\nas it could. The advisers here are<br />\nbusy faculty members, and they<br /><br />\nPhoto by Ginnis<br /><br />\nDR. JOHN L. HAMPSON<br />\nhave their work to do. ... (But)<br />\nthere's not enough communication between student and adviser.<br />\nSome students seem to go along<br />\nand not get 'clued in' until they<br />\nget the axe.\"<br />\nSex Problems<br />\nThe doctor interrupted himself.<br />\n\"You haven't asked me about sex.<br />\nIt's not nearly as frequent a<br />\nproblem as you'd think it would<br />\nbe. It's not that sex and sex problems are not important but they<br />\nfit in ... in a different way from<br />\nthe way that they did 100 years<br /><br />\nCorrespondence<br /><br />\nOf course this is not the whole story. The people we are<br />\nwith have an important influence on our actions; the trouble<br />\nis, group pressure can work both ways, depending on the<br />\nsituation at the moment. Another point: the campus leaders who are to do the \"persuading\" we have mentioned, are<br />\nleaders because of their disinclination to be a bastard about<br />\nthings. (There is an old News-Letter proverb: \"Nice guys<br />\nfinish last\u2014except when entry representatives are being<br />\nelected.\") The phrase \"knock it off\" carries a certain stigma,<br />\neven among gentlemen and scholars.<br />\nWhat it boils down to is this: \"moral suasion\" can<br />\nwork\u2014indeed, already does work\u2014up to a point; but it is<br />\nas optimistic as it is unfair, in a situation where the standards are left to the individual, to expect it to obviate all<br />\nbad publicity for the University, even with all the good<br />\nwill in the world. If the Hopkins man is to be left free<br />\nto develop, it must be expected that there will be development at all levels.<br /><br />\nThe quickest and most obvious<br />\nway to do this is to make money.<br />\nThis makes people, especially his<br />\nboss, think he is EFFICIENT. Who<br />\nwould suspect that it is not efficiency, but done at the expense of<br />\nthe quality of the food? However,<br />\nif he does just make ends meet,<br />\nis there any reason to believe that<br />\nhe is inefficient or that the quality<br />\nof the food is higher? In other<br />\nwords, he may make money with<br />\ngood food or bad food; and he<br />\nmay have good food and make or<br />\nnot make money. Also, he may<br />\nmake money and be efficient or'<br />\nnot efficient, and he may be efficient and make or not make<br />\nmoney.<br />\nThe reason this paradox exists<br />\nis because these terms and standards are without meaning in the<br /><br />\npresent situation. They are without meaning because we do not<br />\nhave free consumer choice.

But most<br />\npeople agree that there are differences, especially in time sequence.Research work comes first, because one of its main objectives is to establish or discover new scientific facts that will<br />\nsupply the foundation for new industrial developments. In<br />\nother .words, research men seek new knowledge about matter, generally working with small quantities of it.<br />\nDevelopment work comes later, and Du Pout has two main<br />\ntypes. First, there is new process development. Here scientists<br />\nand engineers modify, streamline, and augment the findings<br />\nof research so that new chemical products can be profitably<br />\nmade on a large scale\u2014or existing products can be made by<br />\nnewer and more efficient methods. Pilot-plant and semi-works<br />\noperations are usually included under this heading.<br />\nSecond, an important kind of development work is directed<br />\ntoward improvement of existing processes and products. Here<br />\nthe men study how to obtain yield increases, utilize by-products,increase outputs,and solve sales service problems as they<br />\narise. This may require considerable research, and that brings<br />\nus back to the overlapping I previously mentioned.<br />\nThere are genuine differences, John, but a good deal of<br />\nsimilarity,too\u2014especiallyin the constant need for imagination<br />\nand creative effort.

However.<br />\nSchlick is undecided whether to<br />\nuse him in the foil or the epee.<br />\nIf he fences in the foil event, then<br />\nMark Zequeira will be the second<br />\nman on the epee team. But if<br />\nRose competes in the epee, Fred<br />\nRosenblum will get the nod in the<br />\nfoil.<br />\nSchlick commented, \"On the<br />\nbasis of their showing against us,<br />\nTemple and Lehigh will be the<br />\nteams to beat. Every man will<br />\nhave to fence eleven bouts instead<br />\nof the usual three. He will have to<br />\nface his own team mate first and<br />\nthen each man from each of the<br />\nother schools in the other ten<br />\nbouts.\"<br />\n'Supreme Effort'<br />\n\"Everyone on the team will<br />\nhave to be geared to fence these<br />\neleven bouts.
