At present the<br />\nmost important work under way is<br />\nthe plastering of the walls and the<br />\ncementing of the floors preparatory<br />\nto laying wood on them.<br />\nThe colonial hall has been under<br />\nroof for several weeks, and the entire exterior construction is completed with the exception of the<br />\ntiling of the clock tower. This<br />\nwork was delayed by the late delivery of material, but is now under<br />\nway.<br />\nThe engineering building is two<br />\nstories high, and as its construction<br />\nis less complicated than that of Gilman Hall, it, too, will be ready for<br />\noccupancy by next fall, if not sooner. None of the laboratories, however, are building, and it is quite<br />\n. probable that the present buildings<br />\nin the heart of the city will have to<br />\nbe used in connection with those at<br />\nHomewood until the new \"labs\"<br />\nare built. This perhaps will compel a rearrangement of schedules,<br />\nat least for the engineering men,<br />\nunder which they will attend lectures at Homewood and then come<br />\nto the present group for laboratory<br />\nwork.<br />\nSeveral changes have been made<br />\nin the original plans of Gilman<br />\nHall, one of which was the enlarging of the windows in the readingroom of the library. According to<br />\nthe first drawings the window sill<br />\nwas five feet above the floor. When<br />\nsome of the trustees saw this feature and had talked with the architect, it was decided to lower .the<br />\nsill to three feet above the floor.<br />\nThe change required some time, as<br />\nthe brickwork and window frames<br />\nhad been completed and had to be<br />\ntorn down.<br />\nMany of the faculty and student<br />\nhave visited the two buildings during the past weeks, and were disappointed when not allowed to<br />\nenter. Until recently, they had<br />\nbeen open, but when tile plastering<br />\nand cementing began, the contractors put up \"No Admission\" signs,<br />\nfor they feared the loyalty of students who might carve class numerals on the walls.<br />\nThe oval garden on Charles street<br />\nhas been curbed in, and the parks<br />\non each side made to conform.

Prof. John A. Lomax,<br />\nof the University of Texas, president of the American Folk-Lore Society, will speak on \"The Songs of<br />\nthe Cowboy.\"<br />\nProfessor Lomax is a pioneer<br />\nin American balladry. For three<br />\nyears Ile was the Sheldon Fellow<br />\nat Harvard University in the pursuance of the study of American<br />\nballads. He traveled over the<br />\nUnited States, and -from every corner of this country where primitive life has sought spontaneous expression in song, he has personally,<br />\nwith the aid of the phonograph,<br />\ngathered his immense collection of<br />\nballads.\" Ex-President Roosevelt<br />\nhas been interested in Professor<br />\nLomax's work and has remarked<br />\nthat \"there is something very curious in the reproduction here on this<br />\nnew continent of essentially the conditions of ballad growth which obtained in medieval England.\"<br />\nProfessor Lomax has made two<br />\nlecture tours in this country. He<br />\nhas everywhere been greeted by<br />\nlarge aid enthusiastic audiences.<br />\nHe has spoken at Harvard, Yale,<br />\nVermont, Chicago, Vassar, Kansas,<br />\nIllinois and many other colleges<br />\nand unversities.<br />\nHe is scholarly, very entertaining and all who have heard him<br />\nhave expressed delight. In his lecture in McCoy Hall, he will speak<br />\nof the theories of ballad origin and<br />\nauthorship and will give his own<br />\nexperiences in collecting American<br />\nballads. He will read a number of<br />\nhis cowboy songs, and he has been<br />\nknown to sing or chant some of<br />\nthese to show how the ballads arc<br />\nrecited on- the frontier.<br />\n<br />\nThere were over five thousand<br />\ndelegates at the great quadrennial<br />\n'Student Volunteer Convention at<br />\nKansas City, the vast majority of<br />\nthem students, representing seven<br />\nhundred and fifty institutions of<br />\nthe United Stat_s and Canada.<br />\nissionarics from every country of<br />\nthe world, who are at present home<br />\non furlough, were also there.

There were a few meetings,<br />\nhowever, which stood out above the<br />\nothers.

The recitation<br />\nand discussion of the ballads of the<br />\n.\"men of the West\" by a true<br />\nscholar, by the president of the<br />\nAmerican Folk-Lore Society, in itself sounds most attractive, but the<br />\nappreciation expressed by leading<br />\nstudents of literature mak zs it<br />\ndoubly so.<br />\nProf. William Lyon Phelps, of<br />\nYale, said: \"He succeeds to a high<br />\ndegree in combining definite instruction with continuous entertainment.

We are grateful to the students (Messrs. Leland,<br />\nCorner, Hammond and others) who<br />\nwoke us up to the nec.ssity of<br />\nadopting it. The ease with which<br />\nthe students and professors accustomal themselves to the change is<br />\nnothing short of remarkable.<br />\nThe sugg:stion has be:n made<br />\nthat, to make the system in examinations complete, no member of the<br />\nfaculty or assistant should remain<br />\nin the examination rooms after the<br />\npapers are given out. Seldom, it<br />\nis said, do students desire to consult with a professor during an exanimation ; that, should they wish<br />\nto do so, it would be very easy<br />\nfor the professor to indicate on the<br />\npaper the room in which he might<br />\nbe found. The professors, however, are very often question -xl, and<br />\nw:re they not :n the room valuable<br />\ntime would be lost in hunting them<br />\nup. BeEides the presence of a proEssor checks the hilarity which,<br />\nin some class- s, seems bound to<br />\narise.<br />\nAbsence from the examination<br />\nroom for five or ten minutes is a<br />\ngreat relaxation. How glad one is<br />\nto relieve his mind by a few whiffs<br />\nat the soothing cheroot or to indulge in .some ice water!<br />\nSome professors were surprised<br />\nthat so few men added the assurance of honesty at the end of their<br />\npapers. This arose, undoubtedly,<br />\nmore from hurry or forgetfulness<br />\nthan from disinclination.<br />\nBut the honor system is too good<br />\nto be restricted merely to exams;<br />\nit should be extended to the recitations and quizzes. One often wonders in a recitation how a man can<br />\nconscientiously give the professor<br />\nas his own what has just been<br />\nwhispered in his ear by his next<br />\nneighbor.<br />\nA quizz is regardal as an examination by the authorities, and should<br />\nbe so considered by the students.<br />\nWe recommend that the efficient<br />\ncommitt:e which brought about the<br />\nintroduction of the honor system<br />\nsee to its further extension.<br />\nAntagonism?

Lomax's. lecture on<br />\n\"The Songs of the Cowboy\" one of<br />\nthe most interesting of this academic year's talks. The recitation<br />\nand discussion of the ballads of the<br />\n.\"men of the West\" by a true<br />\nscholar, by the president of the<br />\nAmerican Folk-Lore Society, in itself sounds most attractive, but the<br />\nappreciation expressed by leading<br />\nstudents of literature mak zs it<br />\ndoubly so.<br />\nProf. William Lyon Phelps, of<br />\nYale, said: \"He succeeds to a high<br />\ndegree in combining definite instruction with continuous entertainment. Every moment of the hour<br />\nwas interesting.\"<br />\nDean Briggs, of Harvard, wrote<br />\nhim: \"The more colleges that 'get<br />\na chance at your lecture the better.\"<br />\nTheodore Roosevelt, in the preface to Professor Lomax's book on<br />\ncowboy songs, said of the American ballads: \"There \u2022 is something<br />\nvery curious in the reproduction<br />\nhere on this new continent of essentially the conditions of ballad<br />\ngrowth which obtained in Medieval<br />\nEngland, including; by the way,<br />\nsympathy for the outlaw, Jesse<br />\nJames taking the place of Robin<br />\n.Hood.\"<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER Kldom places<br />\nspecial emphasis upon lectures delivered at the University, but it does<br />\nso in this instance because it believes Thursday's talk will be of unusual interest.<br />\nHonor System Satisfactory.<br /><br />\nThe honor system, as used in the<br />\nlast examinations, has proved extremely satisfactory. We are grateful to the students (Messrs. Leland,<br />\nCorner, Hammond and others) who<br />\nwoke us up to the nec.ssity of<br />\nadopting it. The ease with which<br />\nthe students and professors accustomal themselves to the change is<br />\nnothing short of remarkable.<br />\nThe sugg:stion has be:n made<br />\nthat, to make the system in examinations complete, no member of the<br />\nfaculty or assistant should remain<br />\nin the examination rooms after the<br />\npapers are given out. Seldom, it<br />\nis said, do students desire to consult with a professor during an exanimation ; that, should they wish<br />\nto do so, it would be very easy<br />\nfor the professor to indicate on the<br />\npaper the room in which he might<br />\nbe found. The professors, however, are very often question -xl, and<br />\nw:re they not :n the room valuable<br />\ntime would be lost in hunting them<br />\nup. BeEides the presence of a proEssor checks the hilarity which,<br />\nin some class- s, seems bound to<br />\narise.<br />\nAbsence from the examination<br />\nroom for five or ten minutes is a<br />\ngreat relaxation. How glad one is<br />\nto relieve his mind by a few whiffs<br />\nat the soothing cheroot or to indulge in .some ice water!<br />\nSome professors were surprised<br />\nthat so few men added the assurance of honesty at the end of their<br />\npapers. This arose, undoubtedly,<br />\nmore from hurry or forgetfulness<br />\nthan from disinclination.<br />\nBut the honor system is too good<br />\nto be restricted merely to exams;<br />\nit should be extended to the recitations and quizzes. One often wonders in a recitation how a man can<br />\nconscientiously give the professor<br />\nas his own what has just been<br />\nwhispered in his ear by his next<br />\nneighbor.<br />\nA quizz is regardal as an examination by the authorities, and should<br />\nbe so considered by the students.<br />\nWe recommend that the efficient<br />\ncommitt:e which brought about the<br />\nintroduction of the honor system<br />\nsee to its further extension.<br />\nAntagonism? No!<br /><br />\nThe Western Maryland College<br />\nMonthly for December says: \"Hopkins and Western Maryland have<br />\nlong been aware of each other by<br />\n\u2022their antagonisms mainly. Once a<br />\nyear each is interested in the muscular aspect of the other, and their<br />\ncontrariness of interest is about all<br />\nthey have in common.\"<br />\nNot so, Western Maryland!<br />\nThere is no antagonism here.
