Calvert St, Baltimore, Md.<br />\n<br />\nHOMEWOOD, BALTIMORE, MD., JANUARY 15, 1926.<br />\n<br />\nENCOURAGING UNREST<br />\nJust as the campus organizations had seemed to settle down<br />\npermanently to the state of placid routine and complacent selfsatisfaction which has prevailed ever since the sweeping expansions and improvements of 1922 and 1923, a hopeful note has<br />\nagain been sounded.<br />\nThis is none other than the proposed reorganization of the<br />\nHullabaloo. Somehow this respected and time-honored institution escaped the wave of reform that launched the Blue Jay,<br />\nchanged the policy of \u2022the NEWS-LETTER and revivified the<br />\nMusical Club and Barnstormers. Consequently, the year book,<br />\nalthough it has maintained a relatively high standard, has been<br />\nlaboring under the serious difficulties of unqualified popular<br />\nelection of its two chief officers and their inexperience in a<br />\nhighly technical line of work after they are elected.<br />\nThe plan suggested by the editor of this year's Hullabaloo<br />\nis an excellent one. It introduces a system of competition and<br />\nputs the year book on the same footing with other campus publications. While the election of chief officers is left in the hands<br />\nof the class, the chances for the choice of capable and experienced men are greatly increased by the provision that the candidates must have won places on the Hullabaloo strictly on their<br />\nmerits.<br />\nTo secure the adoption the sanction of quite a few of the<br />\npowers that be in undergraduate affairs. The merits of the<br />\nplan preclude any chance of active opposition, but campus<br />\n'inertia remains\u2014an obstacle almost as difficult to overcome,<br />\nand twice as discouraging.<br />\nWe sincerely hope that the Hullabaloo editor will be successful in the campaign of stump speeches that he has already<br />\nbegun.<br />\n<br />\nTHE BEAUTIFUL SNOW<br />\nThe snow, the snow, the beautiful snow, visited the campus,<br />\nnot to mention the rest of the city, last week. And as a direct<br />\nconsequence, the slush, the slush, the gushy slush, is with us<br />\ntoday.<br />\nAll of which is preliminary to some observations on the<br />\nstate of the campus. Watery ice has encroached upon the ankles<br />\nof the unfortunate editor, the staff is confined to its respective<br />\nbeds with severe colds and other bronchial affections, and half<br />\nof the college world coughs and barks with unaccustomed vigor.<br />\nSwear words pollute the fair air of Homewood, swear words<br />\nand rasping barks of those who do not use Smith Brothers.<br />\nAll of these unpleasant happenings are entirely due to ice<br />\nand ,slush. It would have been a great help if the laboring staff<br />\nof the University could have at least made paths for the stulents' feet. But perhaps the laborers were overworked.

Somehow this respected and time-honored institution escaped the wave of reform that launched the Blue Jay,<br />\nchanged the policy of \u2022the NEWS-LETTER and revivified the<br />\nMusical Club and Barnstormers. Consequently, the year book,<br />\nalthough it has maintained a relatively high standard, has been<br />\nlaboring under the serious difficulties of unqualified popular<br />\nelection of its two chief officers and their inexperience in a<br />\nhighly technical line of work after they are elected.<br />\nThe plan suggested by the editor of this year's Hullabaloo<br />\nis an excellent one. It introduces a system of competition and<br />\nputs the year book on the same footing with other campus publications. While the election of chief officers is left in the hands<br />\nof the class, the chances for the choice of capable and experienced men are greatly increased by the provision that the candidates must have won places on the Hullabaloo strictly on their<br />\nmerits.<br />\nTo secure the adoption the sanction of quite a few of the<br />\npowers that be in undergraduate affairs. The merits of the<br />\nplan preclude any chance of active opposition, but campus<br />\n'inertia remains\u2014an obstacle almost as difficult to overcome,<br />\nand twice as discouraging.<br />\nWe sincerely hope that the Hullabaloo editor will be successful in the campaign of stump speeches that he has already<br />\nbegun.<br /><br />\nTHE BEAUTIFUL SNOW<br />\nThe snow, the snow, the beautiful snow, visited the campus,<br />\nnot to mention the rest of the city, last week. And as a direct<br />\nconsequence, the slush, the slush, the gushy slush, is with us<br />\ntoday.<br />\nAll of which is preliminary to some observations on the<br />\nstate of the campus. Watery ice has encroached upon the ankles<br />\nof the unfortunate editor, the staff is confined to its respective<br />\nbeds with severe colds and other bronchial affections, and half<br />\nof the college world coughs and barks with unaccustomed vigor.<br />\nSwear words pollute the fair air of Homewood, swear words<br />\nand rasping barks of those who do not use Smith Brothers.<br />\nAll of these unpleasant happenings are entirely due to ice<br />\nand ,slush. It would have been a great help if the laboring staff<br />\nof the University could have at least made paths for the stulents' feet. But perhaps the laborers were overworked.
