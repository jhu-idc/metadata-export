IRA REMSEN<br />\nThe death of Dr. Remsen, the second of the great men in the<br />\nhistory of Hopkins lost to the University within the span of a single week leaves a gap the consciousness of which will remain for<br />\na long time, and one which can never be entirely filled. It could<br />\nnot be otherwise with a man who has meant so much to Hopkins.<br />\nHe had been connected with the University ever since its beginning, always in a distinguished capacity. As a member of the<br />\nfamous original faculty he was both a brilliant chemist and an<br />\ninspiring professor; during his term as president he performed inestimable services; and for the past fifteen years, as President<br />\nEmeritus he continued to devote his interest and to lend the prestige of his name to the University he had served so long.<br />\nAlthough the students, taken as a group are perhaps unable to<br />\nshare in the personal sorrow of those men of Hopkins who actually<br />\nknew Dr. Remsen, and who cherish and reverence his memory as<br />\na man as well as a scholar; to them also his death means more than<br />\nwe can adequately put into words.<br />\nHe was a symbol, a link with the University's inspiring past.<br />\nThe one tradition which all Hopkins' men hold dear is the thought<br />\nof those early days, of the little group of brilliant men who in so<br />\nshort a time so firmly established the reputation of the infant university. It has meant a great deal to know that one of those men<br />\nstill lived; that as recently as the Half Century Celebration he was<br />\nan interested participant.<br />\nNow, however, the founders, that group already revered as a<br />\ntradition, are at last but a memory. This break with the past,<br />\nhappily so long deferred, although it was of course inevitable, is<br />\nnone the less a shock. No matter to what heights the University<br />\nmay rise, there has gone out from its life something which can<br />\nnever he entirely replaced.<br />\n<br />\nPourboire<br />\n<br />\nENUS<br />\nPENCILS<br />\n<br />\nallmm<br />\n<br />\nta<br />\n<br />\nsa<br />\nor<br />\nth<br />\nlii<br />\n<br />\nsp<br />\nso<br />\nin<br />\n<br />\nat'<br />\nto<br />\nUl<br />\nar<br />\n<br />\nT1<br />\n<br />\nbr(<br />\n<br />\nof<br />\nleg<br />\ntin<br />\nthi<br />\n<br />\nbe<br />\n<br />\ng<br />\nsh(<br />\n<br />\nRe<br />\nOr<br />\n<br />\noil<br />\nrec<br />\n<br />\n#rh<br />\n<br />\ntin<br />\nto<br />\nthe<br />\nby<br />\nand<br />\nlegi<br />\nnot<br />\n<br />\nteat<br />\ntnoi<br />\nby<br />\nCr<br />\nthe<br />\nIt ;<br />\ndid<br />\nlaj<br />\n<br />\n(<br />\nof 1<br />\nson<br />\ndoll<br />\n<br />\nthe<br />\n%el<br />\n<br />\nlnor<br />\nganforr<br />\nadn.<br />\ntwe,<br />\n<br />\nPhia<br />\nthe<br />\ntow:<br />\n<br />\ndun<br />\nIs<br />\nfarm<br />\n<br />\nPrit<br />\n<br />\nbut \u2022<br />\nclas<br />\n<br />\nter<br />\nlatte<br />\n<br />\n\fTHE JOHNS HOPKINS NEWS-LETTER, MARCH 8, 1927<br />\nDR.

IRA REMSEN<br />\nThe death of Dr. Remsen, the second of the great men in the<br />\nhistory of Hopkins lost to the University within the span of a single week leaves a gap the consciousness of which will remain for<br />\na long time, and one which can never be entirely filled. It could<br />\nnot be otherwise with a man who has meant so much to Hopkins.<br />\nHe had been connected with the University ever since its beginning, always in a distinguished capacity. As a member of the<br />\nfamous original faculty he was both a brilliant chemist and an<br />\ninspiring professor; during his term as president he performed inestimable services; and for the past fifteen years, as President<br />\nEmeritus he continued to devote his interest and to lend the prestige of his name to the University he had served so long.<br />\nAlthough the students, taken as a group are perhaps unable to<br />\nshare in the personal sorrow of those men of Hopkins who actually<br />\nknew Dr. Remsen, and who cherish and reverence his memory as<br />\na man as well as a scholar; to them also his death means more than<br />\nwe can adequately put into words.<br />\nHe was a symbol, a link with the University's inspiring past.<br />\nThe one tradition which all Hopkins' men hold dear is the thought<br />\nof those early days, of the little group of brilliant men who in so<br />\nshort a time so firmly established the reputation of the infant university. It has meant a great deal to know that one of those men<br />\nstill lived; that as recently as the Half Century Celebration he was<br />\nan interested participant.<br />\nNow, however, the founders, that group already revered as a<br />\ntradition, are at last but a memory. This break with the past,<br />\nhappily so long deferred, although it was of course inevitable, is<br />\nnone the less a shock. No matter to what heights the University<br />\nmay rise, there has gone out from its life something which can<br />\nnever he entirely replaced.<br /><br />\nPourboire<br /><br />\nENUS<br />\nPENCILS<br /><br />\nallmm<br /><br />\nta<br /><br />\nsa<br />\nor<br />\nth<br />\nlii<br /><br />\nsp<br />\nso<br />\nin<br /><br />\nat'<br />\nto<br />\nUl<br />\nar<br /><br />\nT1<br /><br />\nbr(<br /><br />\nof<br />\nleg<br />\ntin<br />\nthi<br /><br />\nbe<br /><br />\ng<br />\nsh(<br /><br />\nRe<br />\nOr<br /><br />\noil<br />\nrec<br /><br />\n#rh<br /><br />\ntin<br />\nto<br />\nthe<br />\nby<br />\nand<br />\nlegi<br />\nnot<br /><br />\nteat<br />\ntnoi<br />\nby<br />\nCr<br />\nthe<br />\nIt ;<br />\ndid<br />\nlaj<br /><br />\n(<br />\nof 1<br />\nson<br />\ndoll<br /><br />\nthe<br />\n%el<br /><br />\nlnor<br />\nganforr<br />\nadn.<br />\ntwe,<br /><br />\nPhia<br />\nthe<br />\ntow:<br /><br />\ndun<br />\nIs<br />\nfarm<br /><br />\nPrit<br /><br />\nbut \u2022<br />\nclas<br /><br />\nter<br />\nlatte<br /><br />\nTHE JOHNS HOPKINS NEWS-LETTER, MARCH 8, 1927<br />\nDR.
