Over 200,000 people,<br />\nprimarily university students, unquestionably showed to<br />\nthe President of this country their abhorrence of America's involvement in Southeast Asia.<br />\nIt is admirable that so many people felt enough<br />\nconviction in their beliefs that the nation's administrators<br />\nare following wrong policies that they actually staged<br />\nsuch a dramatic protest. We do not necessarily agree<br />\nwith what the marchers advocated at the U.N. Plaza,<br />\nbut we strongly praise their feeling of involvement with<br />\nU.S. policies and the courage and determination which<br />\nthey showed in suggesting alternative paths.<br />\nIn effect, the protest movement, which has engulfed<br />\nso many idealistic students, is a modern form of the<br />\ntraditionally conservative American dream for a truly<br />\ndemocratic form of society. With each political lie uncovered by the press, with each soldier killed for an<br />\nuntenable goal, and with each dollar taken from pressing national needs for use in Vietnam, more and more<br />\npeople are strongly questioning the motives and intentions of the administration.<br />\nBut what is most surprising today is that dissent<br />\nby these people, based on disenchantment and the feeling that they must repudiate a corrupted vision of society for a purer one, is passing mainly unheeded and<br />\nunheard by our policy makers. In a society which hangs<br />\nout the carrot of \"democracy\" to the people of the<br />\nworld, it is important that the national leaders give recognition and not scorn to certain segments of belief.<br />\nWhat the protesters last weekend asked of the President was where, in fact, our national interest lies. In<br />\nthe face of our Vietnamese commitment, this is an important question and it is healthy that it is being so<br />\nwidely asked. When former Press Secretary Bill Moyers<br />\nreported the President's \"surprise that any one citizen<br />\nwould feel toward his country in a way that is not consistent with the national interest,\" he was in fact saying<br />\nthat the American people should not even question the<br />\nnational interest.<br />\nDissent enforces democracy, for ideally it enables<br />\nthe nation's leaders to hear the various poles of opinion<br />\nover any issue. Criticism of national policy shows a faith<br />\nthat the nation can do better; it is a far higher act of<br />\npatriotism and faith than the \"red scare\" of McCarthyites,<br />\nthe gun-tottin., of the militiamen, or the egg-throwing<br />\nof the Peter Fchter Brigade.<br />\nPeople have too often feared to speak out against<br />\nthe government, and this more than any other factor is<br />\nthe basis for the long rooted pressure for conformity<br />\nof opinion in America. Freedom of opinion and speech<br />\nare cherished ideals in this nation, but they are spoken<br />\nof in the abstract; only when someone does in fact<br />\nspeak out against the nation do people become shocked.<br />\nAny reference to the Bill of Rights at that point is<br />\nignored.<br />\nAlexis de Tocqueville believed the fault lay in<br />\ndemocracy itself: \"The smallest reproach irritates its<br />\nsensibilities and the slightest joke that has any foundation in truth renders it indignant; from the forms of<br />\nits language up to the solid virtues of its character, everything must be made the subject of encomium.\"<br />\nAs critics of the war grow stronger, many others<br />\nwho believe in the nation's Vietnam policy are accusing<br />\nthe critics of being unpatriotic. Also, these accusations<br />\nare coming more and more from the high levels of government. As war fever and war dissent become more<br />\npolarized, freedom of expression and tolerance of diverse views will grow more difficult to achieve.<br />\nPresident McKinley found solace and solution when<br />\nhe consulted the Lord about the Philippines. His supra<br />\nhuman visitation, a questionable source, gave him his<br />\npolicy design.

Over 200,000 people,<br />\nprimarily university students, unquestionably showed to<br />\nthe President of this country their abhorrence of America's involvement in Southeast Asia.<br />\nIt is admirable that so many people felt enough<br />\nconviction in their beliefs that the nation's administrators<br />\nare following wrong policies that they actually staged<br />\nsuch a dramatic protest. We do not necessarily agree<br />\nwith what the marchers advocated at the U.N. Plaza,<br />\nbut we strongly praise their feeling of involvement with<br />\nU.S. policies and the courage and determination which<br />\nthey showed in suggesting alternative paths.<br />\nIn effect, the protest movement, which has engulfed<br />\nso many idealistic students, is a modern form of the<br />\ntraditionally conservative American dream for a truly<br />\ndemocratic form of society. With each political lie uncovered by the press, with each soldier killed for an<br />\nuntenable goal, and with each dollar taken from pressing national needs for use in Vietnam, more and more<br />\npeople are strongly questioning the motives and intentions of the administration.<br />\nBut what is most surprising today is that dissent<br />\nby these people, based on disenchantment and the feeling that they must repudiate a corrupted vision of society for a purer one, is passing mainly unheeded and<br />\nunheard by our policy makers. In a society which hangs<br />\nout the carrot of \"democracy\" to the people of the<br />\nworld, it is important that the national leaders give recognition and not scorn to certain segments of belief.<br />\nWhat the protesters last weekend asked of the President was where, in fact, our national interest lies. In<br />\nthe face of our Vietnamese commitment, this is an important question and it is healthy that it is being so<br />\nwidely asked. When former Press Secretary Bill Moyers<br />\nreported the President's \"surprise that any one citizen<br />\nwould feel toward his country in a way that is not consistent with the national interest,\" he was in fact saying<br />\nthat the American people should not even question the<br />\nnational interest.<br />\nDissent enforces democracy, for ideally it enables<br />\nthe nation's leaders to hear the various poles of opinion<br />\nover any issue. Criticism of national policy shows a faith<br />\nthat the nation can do better; it is a far higher act of<br />\npatriotism and faith than the \"red scare\" of McCarthyites,<br />\nthe gun-tottin., of the militiamen, or the egg-throwing<br />\nof the Peter Fchter Brigade.<br />\nPeople have too often feared to speak out against<br />\nthe government, and this more than any other factor is<br />\nthe basis for the long rooted pressure for conformity<br />\nof opinion in America. Freedom of opinion and speech<br />\nare cherished ideals in this nation, but they are spoken<br />\nof in the abstract; only when someone does in fact<br />\nspeak out against the nation do people become shocked.<br />\nAny reference to the Bill of Rights at that point is<br />\nignored.<br />\nAlexis de Tocqueville believed the fault lay in<br />\ndemocracy itself: \"The smallest reproach irritates its<br />\nsensibilities and the slightest joke that has any foundation in truth renders it indignant; from the forms of<br />\nits language up to the solid virtues of its character, everything must be made the subject of encomium.\"<br />\nAs critics of the war grow stronger, many others<br />\nwho believe in the nation's Vietnam policy are accusing<br />\nthe critics of being unpatriotic. Also, these accusations<br />\nare coming more and more from the high levels of government. As war fever and war dissent become more<br />\npolarized, freedom of expression and tolerance of diverse views will grow more difficult to achieve.<br />\nPresident McKinley found solace and solution when<br />\nhe consulted the Lord about the Philippines. His supra<br />\nhuman visitation, a questionable source, gave him his<br />\npolicy design.

Be assured they will because Happenings are the biggest college craze since mononucleosis.<br />\nA Happening, in case you don't know, is the first formless art form. Things just happen. For example, eighty<br />\nnaked men come out and squirt each other with fire hoses<br />\ncontaining tinted yogurt. Then eighty more naked men<br />\ncome out and light birthday candles in the navels of the<br />\nfirst eighty men. Then one girl, clothed, comes out and<br />\npulls three thousand feet of sausage casing through her<br />\npierced ear. Then eighty more naked men come out and<br />\neat a station wagon.<br />\nThere is, of course, a musical accompaniment to all<br />\nthese fun things.

Beards were worn in the past not so<br />\nmuch as a protest, but because shaving was such a painful<br />\nexperience. Then along came Personna Super Stainless<br />\nSteel Blades.<br />\nToday if you don't want to shave, well, that's your<br />\nhangup, isn't it, baby? I mean when you've got a blade<br />\nlike Personna that tugs not neither does it scrape, what's<br />\nyour copout, man? I mean like get with it; you're living<br />\nin the past. Shaving used to hurt, used to scratch, used to<br />\ngouge, used to give you all kinds of static. But not since<br />\nPersonna. It's a gas, man. It's a doozy; it's mom's apple<br />\npie. You dig?<br />\nI mean, man, you still want a beard? Crazy! But you<br />\ndon't have to turn your face into a slum, do you? Shave<br />\naround the bush, baby, neatly and nicely with Personna.<br />\nI mean like Personna comes in double-edge style and<br />\nInjector style too.
