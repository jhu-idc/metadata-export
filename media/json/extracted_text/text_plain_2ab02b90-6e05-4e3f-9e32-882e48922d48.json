In the<br />\nfirst place he said that he was naturally serious and especially so in<br />\nacademic matters. He expressed<br />\nthe wish that all students should be<br />\na bit more serious in regards to<br />\ntheir college education. The students should find out which things<br />\nare the more worth while, those of<br />\nthe soul or of the body. Dr. Ames<br />\nsaid that if the students do not<br />\nmake up their minds as to what<br />\nthey are striving for and then go<br />\nafter that thing, their time is completely wasted. Above all he emphasized the fact that the men must<br />\nnot forget the things of the spirit,<br />\nsuch as art, and music, and good<br />\nbooks.<br />\nLeisure Reading<br />\n<br />\nIn regard to books Dr. Ames<br />\nsaid that all students should do a<br />\nlot of leisure reading, that man who<br />\nhas gone thru college without doing any reading in his spare time<br />\nhas lost a wonderful thing.

Just how much more so will<br />\nbe seen.<br />\nLocal fans are regaining some<br />\nof the enthusiasm which had been<br />\nlost during the past two seasons.<br />\nAll agree that the Jays are much<br />\nstronger than last fall. Upsala was<br />\nunable to stop the locals' offensive<br />\ndrives and the New Jersey attack<br />\ncould not penetrate the Black and<br />\nBlue defense. Late in the last quarter they managed to gain against<br />\nthe reserves, but against the varsity<br />\nthey were held to a standstill.<br />\nComplaints<br />\n<br />\nAlthough the majority of fans<br />\nseemed pleased with the lighting<br />\nsystem at Homewood, there are<br />\nquite a few discussions on the advisability of night football. Several<br />\nhave complained that the use of<br />\nartificial light has robbed the game<br />\nof numerous thrills.

At Hopkins we face the same problem. Only a small<br />\nfraction of the members of any class cast their ballots in the annual<br />\nelections. Then when the results are announced, the cry of dirty<br />\ncampus politics inevitably arises. Let us investigate the matter.<br />\nAs the time for nominations draws near there are usually one or<br />\ntwo prominent men in the class who are well qualified to fill a particular office. These men are nominated without any political move.<br />\nSome ambitious fraternity or other group will see to it that one of<br />\nits less able men is nominated. Election day arrives. The fraternities<br />\nor friends of the able men usually do little or no electioneering. They<br />\ntake it for granted that their candidate will be elected because of his<br />\nqualifications for the office. On the other hand, the supporters of the<br />\nman not so well qualified, realizing that votes must be secured, proceed<br />\nto electioneer. Their methods _need not be discussed as they are well<br />\nknown to every student. The votes are counted and a so-called \"dark<br />\nhorse\" is elected. The cry of dirty politics arises.<br />\nThis situation may easily be remedied. At present it is comparatively<br />\neasy to elect a man to an office which he does not deserve because<br />\nsuch a small number of votes are necessary to carry the election. The<br />\nvery ones who complain the most are generally to blame. Some of<br />\nthem say that the situation is hopeless and do not vote at all; others<br />\ncast their own ballot but never urge others to show their preference<br />\non the ticket. If every student who is interested in any activity of<br />\nhis class should vote, and see to it that others did the same, more able<br />\nclass officers would undoubtedly be elected. At the same time we<br />\nwould like to suggest that the able candidates be more actively supported by their friends.<br />\n<br />\nBARNSTORMERS<br />\nnight the Barnstormers held their annual rally. The results of<br />\nL AST<br />\nthe changes of policy of the organization this year will be of<br />\n<br />\ninterest to all undergraduates. The chief problem is whether or not a<br />\nfinished production can be prepared during the first semester. There<br />\nwill be fewer conflicts the first week in December than during March<br />\nor April, and a larger audience may be expected.

The bequest of Mrs. Mary King Carey, which made the erection of the windows possible, is certainly appreciated. The work of<br />\nMr. J. Scott Williams in designing the windows was of the highest<br />\norder. Mr. W. L. Ross is deserving of praise for generously providing the means of making the furniture fit the beautiful windows.<br />\nLastly, the endeavors of the University librarian, Dr. John Calvin<br />\nFrench, in supervising the work merit congratulations from all those<br />\nconnected with Hopkins.<br />\n<br />\nTHE NIGHT FOOTBALL RACKET<br />\nBy GEORGE E. BANKS,JR.'29<br />\nAfter much preliminary hoopla,<br />\nstrong-armed publicity, and a brilliant display of showmanship, night<br />\nfootball has finally made its debut<br />\non the Homewod campus. To advertise this nocturnal spectacle, the<br />\nmaster minds of the Athletic Department employed an ingenious device. They hired the steam calliope<br />\nwhich, for many months, has been<br />\ntouring the downtown boulevards<br />\nmaking life miserable for the good<br />\ncitizens of Baltimore. This same<br />\ncontraption has been used to exploit the charms of the \"Kuddling<br />\nKuties\" at the Gayety Theatre and<br />\nthe antics of the demented cuckoos<br />\nwho have been shuffling around<br />\nCarlin's dance pavilion for several<br />\nthousand hours. Thus, Hopkins<br />\nathletics take their place in the spotlight with the seductive burlesque<br />\nbabies of East Baltimore Street and<br />\nthe bleary-eyed nit-wits who are<br />\nparticipating in the dance marathon.<br />\nIn spite of the calliope, several<br />\nthousand chilly football fans wended their way to Homewood field,<br />\nlast Saturday night, to see what this<br />\nnight football business is all about,<br />\nif anything. For two long hours,<br />\nthey sat on concrete slabs, cooled<br />\nto the temperature of icebergs, and<br />\nwatched something that looked a little bit like a football game. They<br />\nfaced the cruel glare of six immense<br />\narc lights which dazzled the eyes<br />\nlike airport beacons. After the contest, plenty of the folks who followed the pied pipings of the calliope were wishing that they had<br />\ngone to a cozy movie parlor or<br />\nstayed home beside the steam radiator and listened to Rudy Vallee on<br />\nthe radio. The next morning, when<br />\nthey awake with stiff necks, sore<br />\nthroats and snuffling noses, they<br />\nwere even more certain that night<br />\nfootball is not a healthful diversion<br />\nfor the humble spectator.<br />\nThe big mystery, which no one<br />\nscems able to explain, is just why it<br />\nis necessary for Hopkins to play<br />\nfootball games after sunset. Certainly, there is no appreciable gain<br />\nto be made at the box office. Almost<br />\nevery business man or factory laborer has a half-day holiday on Saturday. The student body does not<br />\nhave to attend classes or work in<br />\nlaboratories on Saturday afternoon.<br />\nJust as many people can attend in<br />\nthe afternoon as night. Of course,<br />\nif the game conflicts with a strong<br />\ncounter attraction at the Stadium,<br />\nthere is some justification for an<br />\nevening game. But this situation<br />\nwill occur but once this season.<br />\nHomewood Field has always provided a perfect setting for afternoon football games. The rich,<br />\nbrilliant autumnal foliage of Wyman's Park forms a picturesque<br />\nbackground. The brisk, snappy<br />\nquality of the atmosphere is a real<br />\ntonic. One's eyes sparkle and cheers<br />\nfor dear, old Alma Mater leap from<br />\nthe throat spontaneously. The<br />\nfootball fan feels that it's good to<br />\nbe alive. He trudges off to dinner<br />\nwith a keen appetite, whetted by the<br />\ncrisp, invigorating air.<br />\nNow, compare the afternoon<br />\nbrand of weather with the dank,<br />\nchilly atmosphere which characterizes October and November nights.<br />\nThe air is cold and penetrating. The<br />\nbrightly colored trees are transformed into black, forbidding shadows. And the chances are two to<br />\none that the fan will awaken the<br />\nnext morning with a kink in his<br />\nneck.<br />\nNight football, as it is now being<br />\n<br />\nplayed at Homewood, is grossly unfair to the visiting team. Upsala<br />\ngridders were muffing lots of balls<br />\nduring the preliminary practice.<br />\nDuring the game, they seemed bewildered by the strong glare of the<br />\narc lights.<br />\nOn the other hand, the Jays can<br />\npractice under the lights every evening if they find it desirable to perfect their night game. They can<br />\naccustom themselves to the playing<br />\nconditions and shake off the strange<br />\nfeeling of \"unreality\" which the<br />\nstrong lights create.<br />\nBut the visiting team, entirely<br />\nunaccustomed to these moonlight<br />\nmonkeyshines, arrives on the scene<br />\nand has only twenty or thirty minutes to get used to the tricky playing conditions. Visiting players now<br />\nhave a gilt-edge alibi to offer for<br />\ntheir defeats. There's small glory<br />\nawaiting the Jays in conquering<br />\nmystified foes that can't catch a<br />\nwhite football that looks as big as<br />\na house. No wonder the Lehigh<br />\nteam refused to play tomorrow's<br />\ncontest in the blinding glare of the<br />\narc lights.<br />\nIn its present stage of development, night football takes its place<br />\nbeside miniature golf as a freakish<br />\nnovelty which is destined to live a<br />\nshort life. For a little while, we<br />\ncan expect to witness good crowds<br />\nat these night contests. But, after<br />\nthe initial thrill has faded away, the<br />\nloyal fans will clamor for real football, played in the warm sunshine.<br />\nWide open spaces will start to appear in the stands. Then, the wise<br />\nmen who have to pay the electric<br />\ncompany's bill for the lighting system, will want to put a mortgage on<br />\nGilman Hall.<br />\n<br />\nSTETSON CLOTHES<br />\n<br />\nbeit<br />\ngre;<br />\nasti<br />\nobe<br />\ncol]<br />\nam<br />\n<br />\nfor<br />\n<br />\nchc<br />\nber<br />\n<br />\nCollege QXCen<br />\n<br />\npia<br />\nsur<br />\n<br />\nNationally<br />\n<br />\nJustly<br />\n<br />\nKnown<br />\n<br />\nFamous<br />\n<br />\nN(<br />\na<br />\nkil<br />\nnii<br />\n<br />\nMADE FOR YOU<br />\n<br />\nFOUR NORTH HOWARD STREET<br />\n<br />\nSt<br />\n<br />\nw:<br />\n<br />\nUT<br />\n<br />\nnt<br />\nst<br />\ndi<br />\n<br />\n1:4\".<br />\nertt_ \"\"<br />\n<br />\n7/02,<br />\nRecommended by<br />\n11:111.0ir The English Department of<br />\n...<br />\n<br />\n1<br />\n417-<br />\n<br />\nJohns Hopkins<br />\nUniversity<br />\n<br />\nvr-A<br />\nteP.k.<br />\n<br />\nIT WEBSTER'S<br />\n1 COLLEGIATE<br />\nThe Best Abridged Dictionary because it is based upon WEBSTER'S<br />\nNEW INTERNATIONAL\u2014The \"Supreme Authority\".

In the<br />\nfirst place he said that he was naturally serious and especially so in<br />\nacademic matters. He expressed<br />\nthe wish that all students should be<br />\na bit more serious in regards to<br />\ntheir college education. The students should find out which things<br />\nare the more worth while, those of<br />\nthe soul or of the body. Dr. Ames<br />\nsaid that if the students do not<br />\nmake up their minds as to what<br />\nthey are striving for and then go<br />\nafter that thing, their time is completely wasted. Above all he emphasized the fact that the men must<br />\nnot forget the things of the spirit,<br />\nsuch as art, and music, and good<br />\nbooks.<br />\nLeisure Reading<br /><br />\nIn regard to books Dr. Ames<br />\nsaid that all students should do a<br />\nlot of leisure reading, that man who<br />\nhas gone thru college without doing any reading in his spare time<br />\nhas lost a wonderful thing. It is<br />\nthrough how a man spends leisure<br />\ntime that his character may be read.<br />\nHe advised the men to select one<br />\nauthor and read all of his works<br />\nduring a winter. If these things<br />\nwere done, Dr. Ames said he would<br />\nfeel satisfied.<br />\nDr. Berry<br /><br />\nMr. Warlow then introduced<br />\nDean Berry.<br />\nDean Berry opened by saying that<br />\nhe hoped the Freshman class would<br />\nlive up to their reputed good looks<br />\nin every way.

C.<br />\nSevere Test Ahead for Black<br />\nAnd Blue<br />\nWith their 39-6 conquest of Upsala College behind them, the Hopkins team will get a real test tomorrow afternoon when they meet the<br />\nLehigh University eleven at Homewood. Whether or not last week's<br />\nwin was merely a victory over a<br />\nweak team or the Jays really have<br />\nplenty of power in their attack and<br />\na sturdy defense will be revealed<br />\nwhen the teams line up at 8:30 p.m.<br />\nThere is little doubt but that<br />\nLehigh will bring a strong team<br />\nhere. Last week they ran roughshod over the Pennsylvania Military College eleven to score a<br />\n25-to-0 victory. As Hopkins plays<br />\nthe Chester cadets on November<br />\n8th, the game tomorrow will serve<br />\nas a contemporary comparison of<br />\nthe cadets and the Jays, although,<br />\nof course, it is too early in the<br />\nseason to predict any results.<br />\nJays Lost Last Year<br /><br />\nLast year Hopkins opened their<br />\nseason with Lehigh and, after<br />\ntravelling up to Bethlehem, went<br />\ndown to a 26-0 defeat. Without a<br />\ndoubt, Lehigh is stronger than last<br />\nyear. Just how much more so will<br />\nbe seen.<br />\nLocal fans are regaining some<br />\nof the enthusiasm which had been<br />\nlost during the past two seasons.<br />\nAll agree that the Jays are much<br />\nstronger than last fall. Upsala was<br />\nunable to stop the locals' offensive<br />\ndrives and the New Jersey attack<br />\ncould not penetrate the Black and<br />\nBlue defense. Late in the last quarter they managed to gain against<br />\nthe reserves, but against the varsity<br />\nthey were held to a standstill.<br />\nComplaints<br /><br />\nAlthough the majority of fans<br />\nseemed pleased with the lighting<br />\nsystem at Homewood, there are<br />\nquite a few discussions on the advisability of night football. Several<br />\nhave complained that the use of<br />\nartificial light has robbed the game<br />\nof numerous thrills. However, it<br />\nis only fair to state that with one<br />\nor two exceptional plays, the Upsala<br />\ngame last week would not have been<br />\nthrilling either in daylight or at<br />\nnight.<br />\nFull Strength<br /><br />\nHaving come through the game<br />\nlast week with only a few \u2022 minor<br />\ncasualties, the Jays should be able<br />\nto present their full strength when<br />\nthe teams line up for the opening<br />\nwhistle. Mistakes were made last<br />\nweek, as was to be expected.

At Hopkins we face the same problem. Only a small<br />\nfraction of the members of any class cast their ballots in the annual<br />\nelections. Then when the results are announced, the cry of dirty<br />\ncampus politics inevitably arises. Let us investigate the matter.<br />\nAs the time for nominations draws near there are usually one or<br />\ntwo prominent men in the class who are well qualified to fill a particular office. These men are nominated without any political move.<br />\nSome ambitious fraternity or other group will see to it that one of<br />\nits less able men is nominated. Election day arrives. The fraternities<br />\nor friends of the able men usually do little or no electioneering. They<br />\ntake it for granted that their candidate will be elected because of his<br />\nqualifications for the office. On the other hand, the supporters of the<br />\nman not so well qualified, realizing that votes must be secured, proceed<br />\nto electioneer. Their methods _need not be discussed as they are well<br />\nknown to every student. The votes are counted and a so-called \"dark<br />\nhorse\" is elected. The cry of dirty politics arises.<br />\nThis situation may easily be remedied. At present it is comparatively<br />\neasy to elect a man to an office which he does not deserve because<br />\nsuch a small number of votes are necessary to carry the election. The<br />\nvery ones who complain the most are generally to blame. Some of<br />\nthem say that the situation is hopeless and do not vote at all; others<br />\ncast their own ballot but never urge others to show their preference<br />\non the ticket. If every student who is interested in any activity of<br />\nhis class should vote, and see to it that others did the same, more able<br />\nclass officers would undoubtedly be elected. At the same time we<br />\nwould like to suggest that the able candidates be more actively supported by their friends.<br /><br />\nBARNSTORMERS<br />\nnight the Barnstormers held their annual rally. The results of<br />\nL AST<br />\nthe changes of policy of the organization this year will be of<br /><br />\ninterest to all undergraduates. The chief problem is whether or not a<br />\nfinished production can be prepared during the first semester. There<br />\nwill be fewer conflicts the first week in December than during March<br />\nor April, and a larger audience may be expected. On the other hand,<br />\nconcentrated work during October and November will be demanded.<br />\nThe wiseness of this move is therefore questionable.<br />\nThe innovation of having girls to take the female parts will remove<br />\nmany a laugh from the annual show.

BANKS,JR.'29<br />\nAfter much preliminary hoopla,<br />\nstrong-armed publicity, and a brilliant display of showmanship, night<br />\nfootball has finally made its debut<br />\non the Homewod campus. To advertise this nocturnal spectacle, the<br />\nmaster minds of the Athletic Department employed an ingenious device. They hired the steam calliope<br />\nwhich, for many months, has been<br />\ntouring the downtown boulevards<br />\nmaking life miserable for the good<br />\ncitizens of Baltimore. This same<br />\ncontraption has been used to exploit the charms of the \"Kuddling<br />\nKuties\" at the Gayety Theatre and<br />\nthe antics of the demented cuckoos<br />\nwho have been shuffling around<br />\nCarlin's dance pavilion for several<br />\nthousand hours. Thus, Hopkins<br />\nathletics take their place in the spotlight with the seductive burlesque<br />\nbabies of East Baltimore Street and<br />\nthe bleary-eyed nit-wits who are<br />\nparticipating in the dance marathon.<br />\nIn spite of the calliope, several<br />\nthousand chilly football fans wended their way to Homewood field,<br />\nlast Saturday night, to see what this<br />\nnight football business is all about,<br />\nif anything. For two long hours,<br />\nthey sat on concrete slabs, cooled<br />\nto the temperature of icebergs, and<br />\nwatched something that looked a little bit like a football game. They<br />\nfaced the cruel glare of six immense<br />\narc lights which dazzled the eyes<br />\nlike airport beacons. After the contest, plenty of the folks who followed the pied pipings of the calliope were wishing that they had<br />\ngone to a cozy movie parlor or<br />\nstayed home beside the steam radiator and listened to Rudy Vallee on<br />\nthe radio. The next morning, when<br />\nthey awake with stiff necks, sore<br />\nthroats and snuffling noses, they<br />\nwere even more certain that night<br />\nfootball is not a healthful diversion<br />\nfor the humble spectator.<br />\nThe big mystery, which no one<br />\nscems able to explain, is just why it<br />\nis necessary for Hopkins to play<br />\nfootball games after sunset. Certainly, there is no appreciable gain<br />\nto be made at the box office. Almost<br />\nevery business man or factory laborer has a half-day holiday on Saturday. The student body does not<br />\nhave to attend classes or work in<br />\nlaboratories on Saturday afternoon.<br />\nJust as many people can attend in<br />\nthe afternoon as night. Of course,<br />\nif the game conflicts with a strong<br />\ncounter attraction at the Stadium,<br />\nthere is some justification for an<br />\nevening game. But this situation<br />\nwill occur but once this season.<br />\nHomewood Field has always provided a perfect setting for afternoon football games. The rich,<br />\nbrilliant autumnal foliage of Wyman's Park forms a picturesque<br />\nbackground. The brisk, snappy<br />\nquality of the atmosphere is a real<br />\ntonic. One's eyes sparkle and cheers<br />\nfor dear, old Alma Mater leap from<br />\nthe throat spontaneously. The<br />\nfootball fan feels that it's good to<br />\nbe alive. He trudges off to dinner<br />\nwith a keen appetite, whetted by the<br />\ncrisp, invigorating air.<br />\nNow, compare the afternoon<br />\nbrand of weather with the dank,<br />\nchilly atmosphere which characterizes October and November nights.<br />\nThe air is cold and penetrating. The<br />\nbrightly colored trees are transformed into black, forbidding shadows. And the chances are two to<br />\none that the fan will awaken the<br />\nnext morning with a kink in his<br />\nneck.<br />\nNight football, as it is now being<br /><br />\nplayed at Homewood, is grossly unfair to the visiting team. Upsala<br />\ngridders were muffing lots of balls<br />\nduring the preliminary practice.<br />\nDuring the game, they seemed bewildered by the strong glare of the<br />\narc lights.<br />\nOn the other hand, the Jays can<br />\npractice under the lights every evening if they find it desirable to perfect their night game. They can<br />\naccustom themselves to the playing<br />\nconditions and shake off the strange<br />\nfeeling of \"unreality\" which the<br />\nstrong lights create.<br />\nBut the visiting team, entirely<br />\nunaccustomed to these moonlight<br />\nmonkeyshines, arrives on the scene<br />\nand has only twenty or thirty minutes to get used to the tricky playing conditions. Visiting players now<br />\nhave a gilt-edge alibi to offer for<br />\ntheir defeats. There's small glory<br />\nawaiting the Jays in conquering<br />\nmystified foes that can't catch a<br />\nwhite football that looks as big as<br />\na house. No wonder the Lehigh<br />\nteam refused to play tomorrow's<br />\ncontest in the blinding glare of the<br />\narc lights.<br />\nIn its present stage of development, night football takes its place<br />\nbeside miniature golf as a freakish<br />\nnovelty which is destined to live a<br />\nshort life. For a little while, we<br />\ncan expect to witness good crowds<br />\nat these night contests. But, after<br />\nthe initial thrill has faded away, the<br />\nloyal fans will clamor for real football, played in the warm sunshine.<br />\nWide open spaces will start to appear in the stands. Then, the wise<br />\nmen who have to pay the electric<br />\ncompany's bill for the lighting system, will want to put a mortgage on<br />\nGilman Hall.<br /><br />\nSTETSON CLOTHES<br /><br />\nbeit<br />\ngre;<br />\nasti<br />\nobe<br />\ncol]<br />\nam<br /><br />\nfor<br /><br />\nchc<br />\nber<br /><br />\nCollege QXCen<br /><br />\npia<br />\nsur<br /><br />\nNationally<br /><br />\nJustly<br /><br />\nKnown<br /><br />\nFamous<br /><br />\nN(<br />\na<br />\nkil<br />\nnii<br /><br />\nMADE FOR YOU<br /><br />\nFOUR NORTH HOWARD STREET<br /><br />\nSt<br /><br />\nw:<br /><br />\nUT<br /><br />\nnt<br />\nst<br />\ndi<br /><br />\n1:4\".<br />\nertt_ \"\"<br /><br />\n7/02,<br />\nRecommended by<br />\n11:111.0ir The English Department of<br />\n...<br /><br />\n1<br />\n417-<br /><br />\nJohns Hopkins<br />\nUniversity<br /><br />\nvr-A<br />\nteP.k.<br /><br />\nIT WEBSTER'S<br />\n1 COLLEGIATE<br />\nThe Best Abridged Dictionary because it is based upon WEBSTER'S<br />\nNEW INTERNATIONAL\u2014The \"Supreme Authority\".
