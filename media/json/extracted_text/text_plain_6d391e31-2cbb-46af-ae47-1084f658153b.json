There<br />\nwas too much turmoil, too<br />\nmuch beefing, too much<br />\nnoise. Too many people<br />\nwere talking for the sake of talking. Too many people<br />\ndidn't know what they were talking. about. Too<br />\nmany people were indulging in the pleasant pastime<br />\nof destructive criticism\u2014shouting about everything<br />\nfrom Administration to Fascism\u2014for the sheer fun of<br />\nit. In short there was too much hot air.<br />\n<br />\nLet's Start<br />\nFrom<br />\nScratch<br />\n<br />\nLet's all turn over a new leaf this year. Let's<br />\nlook around and take inventory. Let's look into the<br />\ndynamics of the activity all around us and try to find<br />\nout what the score is. Let's start the year firmly<br />\nresolved to reestablish the ideals that thrilled us when<br />\nwe were green freshmen, anxious to hear and quick to<br />\nbelieve.<br />\nLet's forget all the psuedo-sophistication that's become such a nasty integral part of our bearing since<br />\nwe're here, and settle down to show the benefits of<br />\nour stay here in terms of clear, consfructive thought.<br />\nLet's try to recapture the spirit that brought us<br />\nhere originally. Our great institution of thought has<br />\nhad much of its brilliance rubbed off to our eyes<br />\nthrough contact. Familiarity tends to breed contempt,<br />\nbut can be curbed to breed love.<br />\nLet's not know it all for a change. Even talking<br />\ngets monotonous after a while. Let's start listening,<br />\ndenying when necessary, but affirming when true.<br />\nLet's remember that some fellows are sincere no matter which side they're on, even if they are worried<br />\npre-meds or scholarship holders.<br />\n'Let's leave the wise guys to Europe, and become<br />\naware of our own insignificance. Let's remember that<br />\nJ Jones or S Smith derives his identity here not on<br />\nhis own, but from the University.<br />\nLet's start building up for a change instead of tearing down. It's harder, but more permanent. . . .<br />\nThis is honestly the welcome to end all welcomes.<br />\nTwo weeks of frenzied hello-ing are enough for anyone. Even a good thing can<br />\nbe overdone. . . .<br />\n. . . So we're going to confine ourselves not to<br />\nfurther tales of the size of )our class, or how wonderful you boys are. Maybe a few tips on some of<br />\nthe things we've noticed during three years of close<br />\nobservation and participation in campus affairs would<br />\nbe a little more welcome.

Make the most of them.<br />\nIt'll take you roughly two years to get wise to<br />\nyourselves. The two years will be gone before you've<br />\nreally settled down. But it's during this formative<br />\nperiod that you determine exactly what you're to<br />\nderive from a college education. Your ultimate aim<br />\nmust be to reach a stage where a healthy questioning<br />\nskepticism\u2014not a smart cynicism\u2014accompanies your<br />\nabsorption of new materials.<br />\nWell, now how does one go about this?<br />\nIf we could answer that we'd be great educators.<br />\nAll we can hope to do is pass on a few don'ts. First,<br />\ndon't try too hard to be a campus bigwig. It's never<br />\n<br />\nworth it. The same amount of effort turned to other<br />\nlines yields twice the returns.

A good start has been made on solving the<br />\nassembly problem once and for all. The interfraternity rushing question must be settled. Elections and<br />\npolitics still await a thorough investigation. The<br />\nS A C has once again slumped on the job. There's<br />\ncertainly enough to be done without resorting to last<br />\nyear's legislation for material.<br />\nWe're happy that the Council has seen fit to continue last year's referendum, recall, open meetings policy.

There<br />\nwas too much turmoil, too<br />\nmuch beefing, too much<br />\nnoise. Too many people<br />\nwere talking for the sake of talking. Too many people<br />\ndidn't know what they were talking. about. Too<br />\nmany people were indulging in the pleasant pastime<br />\nof destructive criticism\u2014shouting about everything<br />\nfrom Administration to Fascism\u2014for the sheer fun of<br />\nit. In short there was too much hot air.<br /><br />\nLet's Start<br />\nFrom<br />\nScratch<br /><br />\nLet's all turn over a new leaf this year. Let's<br />\nlook around and take inventory. Let's look into the<br />\ndynamics of the activity all around us and try to find<br />\nout what the score is. Let's start the year firmly<br />\nresolved to reestablish the ideals that thrilled us when<br />\nwe were green freshmen, anxious to hear and quick to<br />\nbelieve.<br />\nLet's forget all the psuedo-sophistication that's become such a nasty integral part of our bearing since<br />\nwe're here, and settle down to show the benefits of<br />\nour stay here in terms of clear, consfructive thought.<br />\nLet's try to recapture the spirit that brought us<br />\nhere originally. Our great institution of thought has<br />\nhad much of its brilliance rubbed off to our eyes<br />\nthrough contact. Familiarity tends to breed contempt,<br />\nbut can be curbed to breed love.<br />\nLet's not know it all for a change. Even talking<br />\ngets monotonous after a while. Let's start listening,<br />\ndenying when necessary, but affirming when true.<br />\nLet's remember that some fellows are sincere no matter which side they're on, even if they are worried<br />\npre-meds or scholarship holders.<br />\n'Let's leave the wise guys to Europe, and become<br />\naware of our own insignificance. Let's remember that<br />\nJ Jones or S Smith derives his identity here not on<br />\nhis own, but from the University.<br />\nLet's start building up for a change instead of tearing down. It's harder, but more permanent. . . .<br />\nThis is honestly the welcome to end all welcomes.<br />\nTwo weeks of frenzied hello-ing are enough for anyone. Even a good thing can<br />\nbe overdone. . . .<br />\n. . . So we're going to confine ourselves not to<br />\nfurther tales of the size of )our class, or how wonderful you boys are. Maybe a few tips on some of<br />\nthe things we've noticed during three years of close<br />\nobservation and participation in campus affairs would<br />\nbe a little more welcome. We're not omniscient nor<br />\nhave we less than our share of failings, but, forced<br />\ninto the position of observer, we've seen a good deal.<br /><br />\nDedicated<br />\nto all tired<br />\nFreshmen<br /><br />\nThe Hopkins holds out to you practically unlimited possibilities in every field\u2014the scholastic and<br />\nactivities scenes, the fraternity and social life, the<br />\ncontacts you have anticipated for so many years are<br />\nall here. Make the most of them.<br />\nIt'll take you roughly two years to get wise to<br />\nyourselves. The two years will be gone before you've<br />\nreally settled down. But it's during this formative<br />\nperiod that you determine exactly what you're to<br />\nderive from a college education. Your ultimate aim<br />\nmust be to reach a stage where a healthy questioning<br />\nskepticism\u2014not a smart cynicism\u2014accompanies your<br />\nabsorption of new materials.<br />\nWell, now how does one go about this?<br />\nIf we could answer that we'd be great educators.<br />\nAll we can hope to do is pass on a few don'ts. First,<br />\ndon't try too hard to be a campus bigwig. It's never<br /><br />\nworth it. The same amount of effort turned to other<br />\nlines yields twice the returns. A healthy activities<br />\nprogram for any man includes two interests: the<br />\nfirst in a job that is concurrent with scholastic fields,<br />\nthe second, purely for relaxation. Beyond, this they<br />\ndemand a disproportionate sacrifice of time and<br />\nenergy.<br />\nDon't rush into fraternity if you go at all. The<br />\nfraternity rushers will state their advantages, but<br />\nmake sure you select the proper group, else you will<br />\nbe inactive outside the bunch, or miserable in it.<br />\nDon't take campus politics too seriously. They're<br />\nswell fun, but rotten. business. Never set your heart<br />\non a political job, for there never was the campus politician not doomed to ultimate failure.<br />\nDon't neglect your fun, but most of all don't neglect<br />\nyour studies. Take another tip, they're your best bet<br />\nand the most thrilling experience in store for you.<br />\nAll eyes are focussed on<br />\nthe activities of the Student<br />\ncouncil for the next few<br />\nweeks. Left a heritage of<br />\naction and battle, the Council must show through its actions whether its policy is to be one of headlong\u2014at<br />\ntimes headstrong\u2014plunging, or of more pacific, planned action, or possibly, one of inertia.<br /><br />\nAdvice<br />\nto the<br />\nWar torn<br /><br />\nStrange as it may seem, we strongly urge the<br />\nadoption of a policy somewhere between the two latter alternatives. A little careful consideration reveals<br />\nthe wisdom of the suggestion.<br />\nFirst, for better or for worse, we have no Ricards<br />\non the Council this year. Casting no asperations on<br />\nCarrington Williams, whose past record has certainly<br />\nleft nothing to be desired, there is no one on the Council with the pugnacious aggressiveness that the last<br />\nFuehrer posessed.<br />\nSecond, the men are, in all but the case of Haines,<br />\nentirely without experience. Certainly, dangerous<br />\nthings can be done during their period of learning<br />\nunless caution is to be the motto.<br />\nThird, there isn't such an awful lot to be done.<br />\nLast year's Council, aggressive throughout, accomplished most of the reforms which it set out to achieve.<br />\nThe incumbent Council may undo the work of years<br />\nif it undertakes too ambitious a program.<br />\nNevertheless, what has remained to be done must<br />\nbe done. A good start has been made on solving the<br />\nassembly problem once and for all. The interfraternity rushing question must be settled. Elections and<br />\npolitics still await a thorough investigation. The<br />\nS A C has once again slumped on the job. There's<br />\ncertainly enough to be done without resorting to last<br />\nyear's legislation for material.<br />\nWe're happy that the Council has seen fit to continue last year's referendum, recall, open meetings policy. The boys are earnest and intelligent. We look<br />\nforward to a good program of activity, with a rest from<br />\nrash action.<br />\nThe portrait of a kindly<br />\nlittle t-nan with sparkling<br />\neyes which look down upon<br />\nthe history seminar/ room<br />\nin Gilman hall gained added<br />\nmeaning this week.
