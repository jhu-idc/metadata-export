None of Maryland's<br />\n<br />\nprivate institutions of higher<br />\nlearning\u2014including Johns<br />\nHopkins\u2014are threatened by<br />\npossible court action.<br />\nMost recently, Chief Judge<br />\nEdward S. Northrop ordered<br />\nHEW to immediately produce 70<br />\ndocuments sought by state<br />\nofficials who are challenging the<br />\nthreatened cut-off.<br />\nHEW contends that Maryland<br />\nhas failed to comply with a plan<br />\nit submitted in June, 1974, to<br />\npromote desegregation in public<br />\ninstitutions of higher education<br />\nin the state.<br />\nMartin H. Gerry, acting<br />\n<br />\nHopkins Follows Spirit of Law<br />\nBy ROBBY RIGGS<br />\nUnlike many other institutions<br />\nand businesses, Hopkins has not<br />\nbeen accused of discimination in<br />\nemployment practices by the<br />\nU.S. Department of Health,<br />\nEducation and Welfare, according<br />\nto Provost Harry Woolf.<br />\n\"We have been living up to the<br />\nletter of the law, more. than that,<br />\nto the spirit of the law,\" he<br />\nstated.\"We have tried to produce<br />\nequal pay for equal work. We<br />\naren't under any excessive<br />\nscrutiny.<br />\nAt t he same time, Woolf<br />\nacknowledged the \"pressure\"<br />\nimposed by the frequent leveling<br />\nof charges by HEW, and that<br />\ncompliance with HEW guidelines<br />\nis costly.<br />\nRecently. HEW has held<br />\ninstitutions such as the<br />\nUniversity of Texas and the<br />\nUniversity of California at<br />\nBerkeley to be in violation of its<br />\nguidelines. Additionally, it has<br />\ninvestigated hiring practices in<br />\nseveral Maryland county school<br />\nsystems.<br />\nEqual employment provisions<br />\nare included in Title VII<br />\n(executive order 246) and Title<br />\nIX (the Educational Amendment<br />\nof 1970). According to William<br />\nPipkin, Personnel Director at<br />\nHopkins, the legislation calls for<br />\naffirmative action by employers,<br />\nin addition to simple failure to<br />\ndiscriminate. \"We must act to<br />\nincrease our percentage of<br />\nutilization of minorities and<br />\nfemales,\" he stated.<br />\nA two-factor system is used to<br />\nachieve the proper balance of<br />\nemployees. said Pipkin. \"First we<br />\ntry to get people representative<br />\nof the entire work force to apply.<br />\nThis is affirmative action. After<br />\nthe applications are in, we try to<br />\ndisregard race and sex to comply<br />\nwith the Equal Opportunity<br />\nAct.\"<br />\n<br />\ners Crash Gate<br />\n<br />\nWoolf admitted that no hiring<br />\nprocedure is infallible, however,<br />\n\"There is always a \u2022tension<br />\nbetween the need for equality<br />\nand the need for the right<br />\npersonnel. You can't always fully<br />\nrationalize the choice. Ideally,<br />\none should be able to document<br />\nwhy one faculty member is<br />\nchosen, but good employment<br />\nprocedures tend to produce an<br />\nintuitive component.-<br />\n<br />\nOf the HEW guidelines, Woolf<br />\nstated, \"There is no doubt that<br />\nthey put a lot more pressure on<br />\nus. HEW brings a lot of trivial<br />\ncharges against people. It has also<br />\ncost a considerable amount of<br />\nmoney. We have established<br />\nagencies within the University;<br />\nand we have had to pay for more<br />\npaperwork.\"<br />\n<br />\ndirector of the department's<br />\nOffice for Civil Rights, said the<br />\naction is \"the largest<br />\nenforcement proceeding we have<br />\neven undertaken.\"<br />\nSpecifically, Gerry charges:<br />\nStatewide, the percentage of<br />\nblacks in the predominantly<br />\nblack institutions is increasing<br />\nrather than decreasing.<br />\nThe percentage of black<br />\nstudents at the four<br />\npredominantly black state<br />\ncolleges was 86.9 in 1974. From<br />\n1973 to 1974, three of the four<br />\nincreased the percentage of<br />\nblacks they enrolled. By contrast,<br />\nenrollments at predominantly<br />\nwhite _institutions were only 7.4<br />\nblack in 1974.<br />\nIn Baltimore. the state \"has<br />\nnot taken steps to redefine the<br />\nroles and missions of the<br />\ninstitutions involved.\" This has<br />\nresulted in \"a serious problem of<br />\nprogram duplication.\" Gerry<br />\nmentioned city nursing and<br />\nbusiness administration as<br />\nexamples.<br />\nThe state has taken measures<br />\n.that make black schools \"less<br />\nattractive\" and continues to<br />\ndistribute resources, particularly<br />\nthe establishment of an urban<br />\naffairs program at the University<br />\nof Maryland in College Park after<br />\nit had promised to make a similar<br />\ncenter at Morgan State a model<br />\nfor the State. This action, Gerry<br />\nsaid, \"in effect, cut back the<br />\nMorgan program.\"<br />\nFirst informed of HEW.'s<br />\nintended action in a letter to<br />\nGovernor Marvin Mandel, the<br />\nstate has flatly rejected the<br />\n<br />\ndesegregation which was<br />\nsubmitted to and approved by<br />\nthe Department of Health,<br />\nEducation, and Welfare's Office<br />\nfor Civil Rights.\" he said.<br />\nIn addition to Maryland's<br />\nattempts to stifle HEW's efforts<br />\nto cancel federal funds, January<br />\n9 Baltimore City filed a counter<br />\nsuit.<br />\nHEW first clashed with the<br />\nstate .over noncompliance with<br />\nthe desegregation plan last<br />\nAugust when Mandel lashed out<br />\nat HEW, charging a \"clumsy<br />\neffort at intimidation,\" and.<br />\nadding a dare: \"Please feel to<br />\ninitiate enforcement action at<br />\nyour earliest convenience\"<br />\nUnprecedented<br />\nThat HEW took an angered<br />\nMandel's suggestion surprised<br />\nmost political observers.<br />\nDesegregation suits involving the<br />\nfederal government and states<br />\nand localities had always been<br />\nsettled out of court prior to<br />\nHEW's unprecedented action<br />\nagainst Maryland.<br />\nRecently, an organization of<br />\nblack students in Maryland<br />\ncolleges \u2022 and universities asked<br />\nthe federal District Court in<br />\nBaltimore, where the case is<br />\nbeing heard, to postpone hearings<br />\nin the state higher education<br />\ndesegregation case \"until<br />\ndepositions have been received<br />\nby representatives of the people<br />\nwhom the case would most<br />\naffect\u2014black students.\"<br />\nLitigation is expected to<br />\ncontinue for some months before<br />\na decision is reached in the<br />\ncontroversial case.<br />\n<br />\ncompetition for pre-meds<br />\n<br />\nDean's Office Releases MEAS Statistics<br />\n57.0%<br />\n(3) A+X/T+X<br />\n, By DONALD MORISATO<br />\n(4) A+X+Y/T+Y_ 63.0%<br />\nDuring a special A ED meeting<br />\naccepted ('75)<br />\nJanuary 27, Dr. Matthew.

In accordance<br />\nWith that figure, pre-med<br />\napplications have decreased from<br />\n55% to 51%.<br />\nApplications from prospective<br />\nengineers -have<br />\n/<br />\n2% to<br />\nrisen from 41<br />\n91<br />\n/<br />\n2%. Thomas stated \"All other<br />\nareas, i.e., in the social sciences<br />\nand humanities, have remained<br />\nPretty constant.\"<br />\nBeca use applicants are<br />\nbecoming more conscious of the<br />\nemployment situation, Hopkins'<br />\nplacement of its students in<br />\nProfessional schools is<br />\n<br />\nGlen Thomas<br />\n<br />\nparticularly attractive. Thomas<br />\nalso attributed the increase to \"a<br />\ntremendous effort on the part of<br />\nthe Admissions Staff.\"<br />\nA new admissions procedure<br />\nwas instituted this year, which<br />\nincluded a cutback in full-time<br />\nadmissions staff, faculty<br />\nparticipating in the interview and<br />\nevaluation process, and the use of<br />\nalumni to contact prospective<br />\napplicants.<br />\nThirteen professors at<br />\nHomewood have been retained<br />\non a part-time basis to interview<br />\napplicants in an effort \"to<br />\nimprove the information given to<br />\nfuture students\".<br />\nThe applic,ation has been<br />\nconsiderably reduced, and does<br />\nnot contain space for an<br />\napplicant's written statement.<br />\nMoreover, recommendations for<br />\nadmissions remain optional, so<br />\nthat a student's case rests mostly<br />\non his grades and SAT scores.<br />\nIn a previous interview,<br />\n<br />\nThomas had stated \"I don't<br />\nknow if the increase is because<br />\nthe application itself is easier to<br />\ncomplete or because of our<br />\ncontacts with high school juniors<br />\nlast year.\"<br />\nCommenting on the optional<br />\nteacher recommendations, he<br />\nsaid subjective information such<br />\nas essays, interviews, and<br />\nrecommendations are rarely the<br />\ncrucial factor in the admissions<br />\ndecision.<br />\n\"The 'Buckley Amendment<br />\n(which allows students to<br />\nexamine their records),\"<br />\ncommented Thomas, \"has more<br />\nthan anything provided a cop-out<br />\nfor many guidance people, and<br />\nmakes most recommendation<br />\nletters worthless.\"<br />\nThe overall effect of the<br />\npersonnel and policy changes in<br />\nthe Admissions Office will not be<br />\nknown until the class of 1980 has<br />\nbeen selected, according to<br />\nThomas.<br />\n<br />\nApplication for Undergraduate Admission<br />\nThe Johns Hopkins University Baltimore, Maryland 21218<br />\nas directed in the Now to Apply section.<br />\nReturn ell hems to the Director of Admissions by February let(November 191 for Early Decision candidates and<br />\nJuly let for Winslow Students).<br />\nAn APOlIcallon Fee of $20 must accompany ttsis application.

According to<br />\npre-law advisor Ronald Owens,<br />\nthat is the approximate number<br />\nor pre-law undergraduates.<br />\nLaw school, like other<br />\nprofessional graduate instituions,<br />\nhave experienced a tremendous<br />\nincrease in applications over the<br />\npast few years. One estimate<br />\noffered by the Pre-Law<br />\nHandbook put applications at<br />\nalmost four times the number of<br />\nopenings. Moreover, stated<br />\nOwens, \"interest in law schools<br />\n<br />\nrisen.<br />\nmay level off, but not rapidly<br />\nHopkins, though, has several<br />\ndrop.\"<br />\nInterest<br />\nadvantages for the pre-law<br />\n\"I believe the high interest in student which could help to<br />\nlaw now is due to the fact 'that it ameliorate, if not eliminate this<br />\ntouches so frequently on our anxiety, offered Owens.<br />\neveryday lives. Therefore,<br />\nFor example, courses here<br />\nstudents of every major could concentrate on mastering abstract<br />\nconceivably have an interest in<br />\nprinciples, practice in writing, the<br />\nmethods of research, and<br />\nattending law school,\" said<br />\ndeveloping reasoned analyses\u2014all<br />\nOwens.<br />\nThough the advisor admitted skills which students will need in<br />\nthe financial attraction of the law school, he explained.<br />\n\"Law school is, aside from<br />\nlegal profession, he counseled<br />\nagainst expecting an immediate \u2022 specialized training, also the<br />\nsum total of all that you have<br />\nfortune as an attorney unless<br />\n\"you have a contact with one of learned. It takes a disciplined<br />\nmind to grasp a set of facts and<br />\nthe larger firms.\"<br />\nWith the increasing ,apply a general law to a specific<br />\ncompetition for entrance into law circumstance,\" he ,continued.<br />\nschool, especially the more Owen especially emphasized the<br />\nprestigious institutions, anxiety importance given to independent<br />\namong undergraduates planning a study and research in the<br />\ncareer as an attorney has also undergraduate years here as good<br />\n<br />\nInternational Relations: Getting Into SAIS<br />\nOne of the fastest<br />\ngrowing n-rajors at Hopkins in<br />\nterms ot student enrollment is<br />\nthe international studies program<br />\nIn political science. This year's<br />\nfreshmen class contains the most<br />\nIR majors in recent years.<br />\nPerhaps the major attraction<br />\nof the major is an accelerated<br />\nPlan whereby a student can<br />\nspend his first three years at<br />\nHomewood and his last two years<br />\nat the School of Advanced<br />\nInternational Studies in<br />\nWashington. This allows the'<br />\nstudent to skip one year of<br />\ngraduate study as he takes his<br />\n,masters degree in international<br />\naffairs at the end of the fifth<br />\nYear.<br />\nDr. William Ascher, one of the<br />\nIR advisers believes one reason<br />\nfor the increase in popularity of<br />\nthe major is the fact that<br />\nadvanced degrees in international<br />\nrelations open up several career<br />\nOpportunities in the international<br />\nsphere.<br />\nThese occupations include<br />\nWorking for such diverse<br />\ngovernment agencies as the State<br />\nDepartment, CIA, and Congress,<br />\nas well as entering the private<br />\nsector through international<br />\nbanking institutions and<br />\nmulti-mational corporations.<br />\nWith the additional amount of<br />\n<br />\nWee<br />\n<br />\nWS'<br />\n<br />\nRobert Osgood, Dein ofSAIS<br />\nInternational Studies majors, nearly full schedule together.<br />\nThe benefits of attending SA IS<br />\ncompetition for the accelerated<br />\nmanifold, according to Ellen<br />\nare<br />\nquite<br />\nbecome<br />\nhas<br />\nprogram<br />\nintense. For example, last year Goldman, currently in her fourth<br />\nyear of the accelerated program.<br />\nnine persons out of twenty-one<br />\napplicants were selected for Primarily, the school is rgnked as<br />\none of the finest graduate schools<br />\nSAIS.<br />\nof international affairs in the<br />\nJames P. O'Leary, himself a<br />\ncountry. Additionally, its<br />\nSAIS graduate and currently<br />\nlecturer in international politics, location in Washington, D.C.<br />\nfeels that the emphasis on grades gives a unique advantage to its<br />\namong IR major \"seems to have students in finding employment.<br />\nHowever, Goldman warns<br />\npicked up in the last few years.\"<br />\nOne freshman termed the against undergraduates striving<br />\ncompetition \"vulture-like\" for SAIS too hastily. \"Freshmen<br />\nbecause most IR majors take a should be aware that if they're<br />\n<br />\naccepted as BA-MA's they will<br />\nonly have room for two electives<br />\nin their six semesters at<br />\nHomewood,\" she stated.<br />\nMoreover, the intensive<br />\npressure at SAIS as well as<br />\nradically different social<br />\natmosphere places a heavy<br />\nburden on the BA-MA's. \"The<br />\naverage age of the graduate<br />\nstudents is twenty six and most<br />\nhave already been employed in<br />\nthe international community,\"<br />\nshe offered.<br />\n\" Goldman cites the fact that<br />\nout of the 1975 group of selected<br />\nIR majors, not one is currently<br />\nattending SAIS, in large part<br />\nbecause of their failure to adjust.<br />\nTherefore, while she believes<br />\nthat the Homewood graduates<br />\nare as prepared academically as<br />\ntheir older counterparts, the gap<br />\nin maturity is quite large. \"I<br />\npersonally suggest taking a year<br />\noff before coming to SAIS, both<br />\nin order to master a foreign<br />\nlanguage and also to relax before<br />\nbeginning a new experience.\"<br />\nGoldman also decries the lack<br />\nof cooperation between<br />\nHomewood and the school in<br />\nWashington. \"The people at SA IS<br />\ndon't know Homewood exists.<br />\nIncreased cooperations could<br />\nonly benefit all students in<br />\ninternational affairs.\"<br />\n<br />\npreparation for law studies.<br />\nThough Owens did not know<br />\nexactly how significant a<br />\nHopkins diploma was with law<br />\nschool admissions personnel, he<br />\n.concluded. that \"from my,<br />\nexperience in admissions, the<br />\nstrength of a student's school<br />\nprogram was quit: important.<br />\nAnd I rank our schooi !.nong the<br />\ntop in the couni.,-y.- Ile added<br />\nthat the achievements of Hopkins<br />\nstudents in law school and the<br />\nlegal profession in general hare<br />\nsubstantiated his opinion<br />\nOwens is also very satisfied<br />\nwith the effoits Hopkins has<br />\nmade at assisting pre-law<br />\nstudents. \"I've had enough<br />\nexperience to know that the<br />\nUniversity will respond to an<br />\nundergraduate need once the<br />\nconcern becomes known.\" he<br />\nsaid.<br />\nPerhaps the major<br />\ncontribution the faculty has<br />\nmade toward law school<br />\nappItcations in the pre-law<br />\nrecommendation committee.<br />\nThis voluntary group draws up a<br />\nrecommendation on each<br />\ncandidate who requests one.<br />\nEach faculty member familiarizes<br />\nhimself with a student's grades,<br />\nscores, and activities as well as<br />\nmeeting with the applicant<br />\npersonally. \"I have a feeling that<br />\nif such a committee recommends<br />\na student it will have a very<br />\npositive effect,\" Owens said.<br />\nOne project that the pre-law<br />\nadvisor. is contemplating is the<br />\nformation of a pre-law society.<br />\n\"There has been a strong<br />\nindication from several<br />\nundergraduates that such a group<br />\nis desired and therefore I'm<br />\nSt rongly in favor of it's<br />\ndevelopment.\" As yet, the<br />\nsociety is still in the planning<br />\nstages.<br />\nOwens emphasized that such a<br />\nsociety would respond to the<br />\nrequests of its members and<br />\ninclude speakers on law school<br />\nadmissions, the Law School<br />\nAdmission Test, and studying<br />\nlaw.<br />\nThe department of advising<br />\nand counseling has previously<br />\nieatured such speakers as Ms.<br />\nEstelle Fishbein, University'<br />\ncounsel, and Judge Robert<br />\nHammerman of the Baltimore<br />\nSupreme Bench.<br />\nNext week: Hopkins'record at<br />\nplacing pre-law. studeta s.<br />\n<br />\n\fThE<br />\n<br />\nNEWS-LETTER<br />\n<br />\nrol. lxxx no. 29Ituesday, february 3, 1976Ibaltimore: maryland180th year<br />\n<br />\neditors-in-chief<br />\nbusiness managers<br />\nmanaging editor<br />\nday editors<br />\nfeatures editor<br />\nsports editor<br />\nphoto-production nwnager<br />\nphoto editor<br />\ncontributing editors<br />\n<br />\nDonald Morisato, Russ Smith.<br />\nBob Fitterman, Dante Landucci<br />\nJoe Lobl<br />\nJan Hammerman, Robby Riggs<br />\nDavid Warren<br />\nStephen Levin<br />\nDavid Porter<br />\nJennifer Bishop<br />\nBob Buchanan, Ken Sokolow<br />\n<br />\nThe Johns Hopkins News-Letter is published twice weekly, Tuesday<br />\nand<br />\nFriday, during the academic year.

The Honor Code was promptly<br />\ntossed into the middle of Charles Street.<br />\nIt is no surprise, then, that the new cheat-and-let-cheat<br />\nsystem should produce the case of the foiled B (see letter<br />\nbelow); a student who only wanted.to point out what he felt<br />\nwas a breach of academic trust, only to discover that a single<br />\nstudent is given no credence.<br />\nLordy, what's next?<br />\n<br />\nletters to the editor<br />\nTo the Editor:<br />\nThe Honor Code died an<br />\nignoble death and the Ethics<br />\nBoard was, triumphantly<br />\ninstituted as (hopefully) a more<br />\neffective system. As a student<br />\ninterested in the maintenance of<br />\nthe University's integrity and the<br />\nprotection of honest students'<br />\ninterests, I was anxious to see<br />\nhow this new system worked.<br />\nRecently, a friend (let's call<br />\nthe person .13) _saw a student<br />\ncheating during an exam. B had<br />\nthe guts to report what they saw<br />\nto the professor and a trial with<br />\nthe' Ethics Board was scheduled.<br />\nAt the trial, the accused was<br />\naccompanied by a \"quasi-legal<br />\nrepresentative\" (i.e., a student<br />\nwith some background in law). B<br />\nwas allowed no legal counsel. The<br />\ndefendant was, allowed to state<br />\ntheir case unmolested and to hear<br />\nB's testimony. B was verbally<br />\nharassed and upset by the<br />\nd e fend ant's representative and.<br />\none member of the Ethics Board.<br />\nB. was not permitted to hear the<br />\naccused's testimony.<br />\nThe accused was found not<br />\nguilty. What it came down to was<br />\nB's word against that of the<br />\naccused. B was told by the Board<br />\n(somewhat apologetically) that.<br />\nin effect, a person could not be<br />\nconvicted unless a )Two or more<br />\nstudent's witnessed the act or, b)<br />\na professor saw it (a professor's<br />\nword being considered<br />\nTo the Editor:<br />\nSeeing as that for 100 years<br />\ncertain Hopkins students have<br />\nbeen afflicted by malicious and<br />\nconstant discrimination and<br />\nabuse. I feel that I must now<br />\nbring this problem into open<br />\ndiscussion. This has not been an<br />\nactive form of discrimination but<br />\none consisting of benign neglect.<br />\nOf. course I speak for the poor.<br />\nthe<br />\nthe in<br />\nforgotten, and the ignored: I<br />\nmean us. the socially retarded of<br />\nthe Hopkins communit y.<br />\nWe have been screaming in<br />\nsilence for 'ears! But clearly it<br />\nwould violate our antisocial<br />\n<br />\nunquestionable).<br />\nI realize that the accused must<br />\nbe protected against false<br />\naccusations lodged by some<br />\nparticularly desparate throat.<br />\n(Then let the accused bear the<br />\nburden of proving intent of<br />\nMalice.) Must We bend over<br />\nbackwards to protect the<br />\naccused?<br />\nThe Board's decision on this<br />\nparticular case strikes me- as a<br />\ncarte blanche for all aspiring<br />\ncheaters. Students see the vast<br />\nmajority of cheating that goes<br />\non. Due to peer pressure, one is<br />\nunderstandably reluctant to<br />\nreport an incident and go<br />\nthrough the agony of a trial.<br />\nTherefore; it's unlikely that a<br />\nsingle student would report an<br />\nincident of unethical behavior.<br />\nNow the Board advises B to<br />\n\"grab someone and make sure<br />\nthey see it next time\" in order to<br />\nhave another witness. Ridiculous!<br />\nIs this an effective system?<br />\nIf the faculty and student<br />\nbody are serious about upholding<br />\nt he University's academic<br />\nintegrity, an alternate system of<br />\npriorities must be put into.<br />\npractice. The accused should not<br />\nbe given special protection as<br />\nthough they were the injured<br />\nparty. The academic community.<br />\nwith the accuser as its<br />\nrepresentative, is. after all, the<br />\nones who stand to lose.<br />\nName wit held<br />\nprinciples to \u2022 vote or run for<br />\noffice, and since we have no<br />\nfriends to help us; we are<br />\ndefenseless. I have noticed many times the<br />\nefforts of the Student Council<br />\nfor the social Hopkins students: I<br />\nonly ask for equal time. How can<br />\nwe go to your dances when we<br />\nrefuse to dance? Playing music in<br />\nthe quad only drives us into the<br />\nlibrary. Why can't we have an<br />\nanti-dance for the anti-social, or<br />\norganize a \"Flying Albatross\"<br />\nconcert series?<br />\nLarry Brown<br />\nDave Robbins<br />\nCraig Thompson<br />\n<br />\nOnce again,<br />\n<br />\nU.S. Involvement in Angola ..<br />\nBy TOM MELIA<br />\nLast Tuesday, in the space,<br />\nJ. D. Considine presented his<br />\nviews on America's role in<br />\ninternational affairs, particularly<br />\nwith respect to Angola. Without<br />\ndelving into all the details ofMr.<br />\nConsidine's comments, or even<br />\nthe situation itself; the following<br />\nis presented by way of<br />\nclarification, in order to shed<br />\nsonic light on the true nature of<br />\nthe Angolan situation as far as<br />\nthe United States and the<br />\nU.S.S.R. are concerned.\u2014<br />\nAuthor's note.<br />\nThe Soviet Union did not fool<br />\nanybody by sneaking into Angola<br />\nwith blatant disregard for<br />\nde_teate Though it was ctrrtairity<br />\nnot a good thing that they did, it<br />\nis a cardinal tenet 1 of Soviet<br />\nideology to support leftist<br />\nrevolutionary movements around<br />\nthe world, *something which they<br />\nhave done since World War II.<br />\n(The dialogue of detente does<br />\nnot require that either side bring<br />\nhome its agents from around the<br />\nworld.) Rather, it is an ambitious<br />\nattempt to avoid a major war<br />\nthat today can only mean mutual<br />\nannihilation. Because there has<br />\nbeen no such war ih the<br />\nthirty-odd years since the<br />\nemergence of the United States<br />\nand the USSR as the pre-eminent<br />\npowers in the world, and\u2014more<br />\nimportant ly\u2014becuase the<br />\nlikelihood that such a war will<br />\noccur is less now than it was ten<br />\nand twenty years ago, it might be<br />\ngoing to far to say that \"detente<br />\nhas been derailed.\" If the USSR<br />\nhas benefited more from detente<br />\n(this from the 'One-Way\u2014Street<br />\nschool of thought), it is in the<br />\narea of SALT and trade<br />\nconcessions, and not, as some<br />\nmight maintain, in Viet Nam or<br />\nthe MidEast. It is going too far to<br />\n.say that the United States and<br />\nUSSR have\"essentially the same<br />\ngoals, i.e. conversion of the rest<br />\nof the world.\" There simply is<br />\nnot much basis for a statement<br />\nlike that.<br />\nIt is by no means certain that<br />\n(.a) there is any significant<br />\nstrategic importance to Angola<br />\nthat requires that it be a solid<br />\nAmerican partisan, or (b) a black<br />\nAfrican nationalist movement<br />\nlike the MPLA is at all inherently<br />\nMarxist or that is will operate as<br />\n<br />\n\u2022<br />\n<br />\na Soviet satellite when and if it<br />\nto .effect some kind of \"African<br />\nsecures control of the country. settlement.\" The pro -west<br />\nBecause of the fiercely factions refrained from fighting<br />\nindependent, and generally just before the OAU summite lfl<br />\nanti-white, nature of black Addis Ababa and President Ford<br />\nnationalism, and especially outlined the United States<br />\nbecause of the prospect of Position in a letter to several<br />\nextended. geurilla warfare African heads of state.<br />\nthroughout most of Angola, the<br />\nThat the summit ended with<br />\nSoviet Union may not really have no resolution, no compromise,<br />\nwon any prizes. Most of the not an original African suggestion<br />\npopulation was aligned against that differed from those of the<br />\nthe MPLA, and will continue to United States and USSR,<br />\nharass it. In light of the indicates that the OAU is not the<br />\ntremendous difficulty that answer.

The<br />\nodds not withstanding. a young<br />\nblack playwright named Clifford<br />\nMason, with the backing of the<br />\nCity's cultural arts program, has<br />\nforsaken New York for Baltimore<br />\nin hopes of staging his first<br />\ncommercial success. The play,.<br />\nentitled \"Midnight Special\". is<br />\n<br />\nset in black Harlem and examines<br />\nthe forces which have stifled the<br />\nupward social, economic, and<br />\npolitical mobility of Blacks.<br />\nMason presents a slice of<br />\nghetto life in the setting of The \u2022<br />\nBar, much as William Saroyan did<br />\nin \"Time of Your Life\". The<br />\ncharacters who enter The Bar<br />\npossess, in varying degrees, the<br />\nfull range of weaknesses and<br />\ncallousness which make the<br />\nperpetuation of the ghetto<br />\npossible.<br />\n<br />\nThe story centers around the<br />\nphilosophizing of an old wino<br />\nnamed White Lightnin', whose<br />\ncurses and wisdom are as<br />\nspell-binding as the Ancient<br />\nMariner's. With no past and no<br />\nfuture, Lightnin's discourse is<br />\nconsistently despairing. The time<br />\nfor the Black man to free himself<br />\nfrom the oppression of the<br />\nwhites, \"The Man\", is 100 years<br />\npast, Lightnin' tells an idealistic<br />\nblack revolutionary. Blacks are<br />\nforever trapped into second class<br />\n<br />\nCijingo Bluesmen<br />\n<br />\ncitizenship because \u2022 they are<br />\ncontinuously fighting one<br />\nanother.. \"We can't kill him so we<br />\nkill us,\" Lightnin' explains. The<br />\none ray of hope for Blacks\u2014and<br />\nby extension, for all of<br />\nmankind\u2014is a sense of identity<br />\nwith one another by the<br />\nacceptance of the intrinsic unity<br />\nof Blacks\u2014of all human<br />\nbeings\u2014and the realization that<br />\nBlack killing Black is the<br />\ndestruction of self and<br />\ncompletely void of any<br />\n<br />\nredeeming qualities.<br />\nMason's play is by no means a<br />\npolished work of art.

None of Maryland's<br /><br />\nprivate institutions of higher<br />\nlearning\u2014including Johns<br />\nHopkins\u2014are threatened by<br />\npossible court action.<br />\nMost recently, Chief Judge<br />\nEdward S.

Gerry, acting<br /><br />\nHopkins Follows Spirit of Law<br />\nBy ROBBY RIGGS<br />\nUnlike many other institutions<br />\nand businesses, Hopkins has not<br />\nbeen accused of discimination in<br />\nemployment practices by the<br />\nU.S. Department of Health,<br />\nEducation and Welfare, according<br />\nto Provost Harry Woolf.<br />\n\"We have been living up to the<br />\nletter of the law, more. than that,<br />\nto the spirit of the law,\" he<br />\nstated.\"We have tried to produce<br />\nequal pay for equal work. We<br />\naren't under any excessive<br />\nscrutiny.<br />\nAt t he same time, Woolf<br />\nacknowledged the \"pressure\"<br />\nimposed by the frequent leveling<br />\nof charges by HEW, and that<br />\ncompliance with HEW guidelines<br />\nis costly.<br />\nRecently. HEW has held<br />\ninstitutions such as the<br />\nUniversity of Texas and the<br />\nUniversity of California at<br />\nBerkeley to be in violation of its<br />\nguidelines. Additionally, it has<br />\ninvestigated hiring practices in<br />\nseveral Maryland county school<br />\nsystems.<br />\nEqual employment provisions<br />\nare included in Title VII<br />\n(executive order 246) and Title<br />\nIX (the Educational Amendment<br />\nof 1970). According to William<br />\nPipkin, Personnel Director at<br />\nHopkins, the legislation calls for<br />\naffirmative action by employers,<br />\nin addition to simple failure to<br />\ndiscriminate. \"We must act to<br />\nincrease our percentage of<br />\nutilization of minorities and<br />\nfemales,\" he stated.<br />\nA two-factor system is used to<br />\nachieve the proper balance of<br />\nemployees. said Pipkin. \"First we<br />\ntry to get people representative<br />\nof the entire work force to apply.<br />\nThis is affirmative action. After<br />\nthe applications are in, we try to<br />\ndisregard race and sex to comply<br />\nwith the Equal Opportunity<br />\nAct.\"<br /><br />\ners Crash Gate<br /><br />\nWoolf admitted that no hiring<br />\nprocedure is infallible, however,<br />\n\"There is always a \u2022tension<br />\nbetween the need for equality<br />\nand the need for the right<br />\npersonnel. You can't always fully<br />\nrationalize the choice. Ideally,<br />\none should be able to document<br />\nwhy one faculty member is<br />\nchosen, but good employment<br />\nprocedures tend to produce an<br />\nintuitive component.-<br /><br />\nOf the HEW guidelines, Woolf<br />\nstated, \"There is no doubt that<br />\nthey put a lot more pressure on<br />\nus. HEW brings a lot of trivial<br />\ncharges against people. It has also<br />\ncost a considerable amount of<br />\nmoney. We have established<br />\nagencies within the University;<br />\nand we have had to pay for more<br />\npaperwork.\"<br /><br />\ndirector of the department's<br />\nOffice for Civil Rights, said the<br />\naction is \"the largest<br />\nenforcement proceeding we have<br />\neven undertaken.\"<br />\nSpecifically, Gerry charges:<br />\nStatewide, the percentage of<br />\nblacks in the predominantly<br />\nblack institutions is increasing<br />\nrather than decreasing.<br />\nThe percentage of black<br />\nstudents at the four<br />\npredominantly black state<br />\ncolleges was 86.9 in 1974. From<br />\n1973 to 1974, three of the four<br />\nincreased the percentage of<br />\nblacks they enrolled. By contrast,<br />\nenrollments at predominantly<br />\nwhite _institutions were only 7.4<br />\nblack in 1974.<br />\nIn Baltimore. the state \"has<br />\nnot taken steps to redefine the<br />\nroles and missions of the<br />\ninstitutions involved.\" This has<br />\nresulted in \"a serious problem of<br />\nprogram duplication.\" Gerry<br />\nmentioned city nursing and<br />\nbusiness administration as<br />\nexamples.<br />\nThe state has taken measures<br />\n.that make black schools \"less<br />\nattractive\" and continues to<br />\ndistribute resources, particularly<br />\nthe establishment of an urban<br />\naffairs program at the University<br />\nof Maryland in College Park after<br />\nit had promised to make a similar<br />\ncenter at Morgan State a model<br />\nfor the State.

According to<br />\npre-law advisor Ronald Owens,<br />\nthat is the approximate number<br />\nor pre-law undergraduates.<br />\nLaw school, like other<br />\nprofessional graduate instituions,<br />\nhave experienced a tremendous<br />\nincrease in applications over the<br />\npast few years. One estimate<br />\noffered by the Pre-Law<br />\nHandbook put applications at<br />\nalmost four times the number of<br />\nopenings. Moreover, stated<br />\nOwens, \"interest in law schools<br /><br />\nrisen.<br />\nmay level off, but not rapidly<br />\nHopkins, though, has several<br />\ndrop.\"<br />\nInterest<br />\nadvantages for the pre-law<br />\n\"I believe the high interest in student which could help to<br />\nlaw now is due to the fact 'that it ameliorate, if not eliminate this<br />\ntouches so frequently on our anxiety, offered Owens.<br />\neveryday lives. Therefore,<br />\nFor example, courses here<br />\nstudents of every major could concentrate on mastering abstract<br />\nconceivably have an interest in<br />\nprinciples, practice in writing, the<br />\nmethods of research, and<br />\nattending law school,\" said<br />\ndeveloping reasoned analyses\u2014all<br />\nOwens.<br />\nThough the advisor admitted skills which students will need in<br />\nthe financial attraction of the law school, he explained.<br />\n\"Law school is, aside from<br />\nlegal profession, he counseled<br />\nagainst expecting an immediate \u2022 specialized training, also the<br />\nsum total of all that you have<br />\nfortune as an attorney unless<br />\n\"you have a contact with one of learned.

This year's<br />\nfreshmen class contains the most<br />\nIR majors in recent years.<br />\nPerhaps the major attraction<br />\nof the major is an accelerated<br />\nPlan whereby a student can<br />\nspend his first three years at<br />\nHomewood and his last two years<br />\nat the School of Advanced<br />\nInternational Studies in<br />\nWashington. This allows the'<br />\nstudent to skip one year of<br />\ngraduate study as he takes his<br />\n,masters degree in international<br />\naffairs at the end of the fifth<br />\nYear.<br />\nDr. William Ascher, one of the<br />\nIR advisers believes one reason<br />\nfor the increase in popularity of<br />\nthe major is the fact that<br />\nadvanced degrees in international<br />\nrelations open up several career<br />\nOpportunities in the international<br />\nsphere.<br />\nThese occupations include<br />\nWorking for such diverse<br />\ngovernment agencies as the State<br />\nDepartment, CIA, and Congress,<br />\nas well as entering the private<br />\nsector through international<br />\nbanking institutions and<br />\nmulti-mational corporations.<br />\nWith the additional amount of<br /><br />\nWee<br /><br />\nWS'<br /><br />\nRobert Osgood, Dein ofSAIS<br />\nInternational Studies majors, nearly full schedule together.<br />\nThe benefits of attending SA IS<br />\ncompetition for the accelerated<br />\nmanifold, according to Ellen<br />\nare<br />\nquite<br />\nbecome<br />\nhas<br />\nprogram<br />\nintense.

The Honor Code was promptly<br />\ntossed into the middle of Charles Street.<br />\nIt is no surprise, then, that the new cheat-and-let-cheat<br />\nsystem should produce the case of the foiled B (see letter<br />\nbelow); a student who only wanted.to point out what he felt<br />\nwas a breach of academic trust, only to discover that a single<br />\nstudent is given no credence.<br />\nLordy, what's next?<br /><br />\nletters to the editor<br />\nTo the Editor:<br />\nThe Honor Code died an<br />\nignoble death and the Ethics<br />\nBoard was, triumphantly<br />\ninstituted as (hopefully) a more<br />\neffective system.

B had<br />\nthe guts to report what they saw<br />\nto the professor and a trial with<br />\nthe' Ethics Board was scheduled.<br />\nAt the trial, the accused was<br />\naccompanied by a \"quasi-legal<br />\nrepresentative\" (i.e., a student<br />\nwith some background in law). B<br />\nwas allowed no legal counsel. The<br />\ndefendant was, allowed to state<br />\ntheir case unmolested and to hear<br />\nB's testimony. B was verbally<br />\nharassed and upset by the<br />\nd e fend ant's representative and.<br />\none member of the Ethics Board.<br />\nB. was not permitted to hear the<br />\naccused's testimony.<br />\nThe accused was found not<br />\nguilty.

Must We bend over<br />\nbackwards to protect the<br />\naccused?<br />\nThe Board's decision on this<br />\nparticular case strikes me- as a<br />\ncarte blanche for all aspiring<br />\ncheaters. Students see the vast<br />\nmajority of cheating that goes<br />\non. Due to peer pressure, one is<br />\nunderstandably reluctant to<br />\nreport an incident and go<br />\nthrough the agony of a trial.<br />\nTherefore; it's unlikely that a<br />\nsingle student would report an<br />\nincident of unethical behavior.<br />\nNow the Board advises B to<br />\n\"grab someone and make sure<br />\nthey see it next time\" in order to<br />\nhave another witness. Ridiculous!<br />\nIs this an effective system?<br />\nIf the faculty and student<br />\nbody are serious about upholding<br />\nt he University's academic<br />\nintegrity, an alternate system of<br />\npriorities must be put into.<br />\npractice. The accused should not<br />\nbe given special protection as<br />\nthough they were the injured<br />\nparty.

D. Considine presented his<br />\nviews on America's role in<br />\ninternational affairs, particularly<br />\nwith respect to Angola. Without<br />\ndelving into all the details ofMr.<br />\nConsidine's comments, or even<br />\nthe situation itself; the following<br />\nis presented by way of<br />\nclarification, in order to shed<br />\nsonic light on the true nature of<br />\nthe Angolan situation as far as<br />\nthe United States and the<br />\nU.S.S.R. are concerned.\u2014<br />\nAuthor's note.<br />\nThe Soviet Union did not fool<br />\nanybody by sneaking into Angola<br />\nwith blatant disregard for<br />\nde_teate Though it was ctrrtairity<br />\nnot a good thing that they did, it<br />\nis a cardinal tenet 1 of Soviet<br />\nideology to support leftist<br />\nrevolutionary movements around<br />\nthe world, *something which they<br />\nhave done since World War II.<br />\n(The dialogue of detente does<br />\nnot require that either side bring<br />\nhome its agents from around the<br />\nworld.) Rather, it is an ambitious<br />\nattempt to avoid a major war<br />\nthat today can only mean mutual<br />\nannihilation. Because there has<br />\nbeen no such war ih the<br />\nthirty-odd years since the<br />\nemergence of the United States<br />\nand the USSR as the pre-eminent<br />\npowers in the world, and\u2014more<br />\nimportant ly\u2014becuase the<br />\nlikelihood that such a war will<br />\noccur is less now than it was ten<br />\nand twenty years ago, it might be<br />\ngoing to far to say that \"detente<br />\nhas been derailed.\" If the USSR<br />\nhas benefited more from detente<br />\n(this from the 'One-Way\u2014Street<br />\nschool of thought), it is in the<br />\narea of SALT and trade<br />\nconcessions, and not, as some<br />\nmight maintain, in Viet Nam or<br />\nthe MidEast. It is going too far to<br />\n.say that the United States and<br />\nUSSR have\"essentially the same<br />\ngoals, i.e. conversion of the rest<br />\nof the world.\" There simply is<br />\nnot much basis for a statement<br />\nlike that.<br />\nIt is by no means certain that<br />\n(.a) there is any significant<br />\nstrategic importance to Angola<br />\nthat requires that it be a solid<br />\nAmerican partisan, or (b) a black<br />\nAfrican nationalist movement<br />\nlike the MPLA is at all inherently<br />\nMarxist or that is will operate as<br /><br />\n\u2022<br /><br />\na Soviet satellite when and if it<br />\nto .effect some kind of \"African<br />\nsecures control of the country. settlement.\" The pro -west<br />\nBecause of the fiercely factions refrained from fighting<br />\nindependent, and generally just before the OAU summite lfl<br />\nanti-white, nature of black Addis Ababa and President Ford<br />\nnationalism, and especially outlined the United States<br />\nbecause of the prospect of Position in a letter to several<br />\nextended. geurilla warfare African heads of state.<br />\nthroughout most of Angola, the<br />\nThat the summit ended with<br />\nSoviet Union may not really have no resolution, no compromise,<br />\nwon any prizes.

The<br />\nodds not withstanding. a young<br />\nblack playwright named Clifford<br />\nMason, with the backing of the<br />\nCity's cultural arts program, has<br />\nforsaken New York for Baltimore<br />\nin hopes of staging his first<br />\ncommercial success. The play,.<br />\nentitled \"Midnight Special\". is<br /><br />\nset in black Harlem and examines<br />\nthe forces which have stifled the<br />\nupward social, economic, and<br />\npolitical mobility of Blacks.<br />\nMason presents a slice of<br />\nghetto life in the setting of The \u2022<br />\nBar, much as William Saroyan did<br />\nin \"Time of Your Life\". The<br />\ncharacters who enter The Bar<br />\npossess, in varying degrees, the<br />\nfull range of weaknesses and<br />\ncallousness which make the<br />\nperpetuation of the ghetto<br />\npossible.<br /><br />\nThe story centers around the<br />\nphilosophizing of an old wino<br />\nnamed White Lightnin', whose<br />\ncurses and wisdom are as<br />\nspell-binding as the Ancient<br />\nMariner's. With no past and no<br />\nfuture, Lightnin's discourse is<br />\nconsistently despairing. The time<br />\nfor the Black man to free himself<br />\nfrom the oppression of the<br />\nwhites, \"The Man\", is 100 years<br />\npast, Lightnin' tells an idealistic<br />\nblack revolutionary. Blacks are<br />\nforever trapped into second class<br /><br />\nCijingo Bluesmen<br /><br />\ncitizenship because \u2022 they are<br />\ncontinuously fighting one<br />\nanother.. \"We can't kill him so we<br />\nkill us,\" Lightnin' explains. The<br />\none ray of hope for Blacks\u2014and<br />\nby extension, for all of<br />\nmankind\u2014is a sense of identity<br />\nwith one another by the<br />\nacceptance of the intrinsic unity<br />\nof Blacks\u2014of all human<br />\nbeings\u2014and the realization that<br />\nBlack killing Black is the<br />\ndestruction of self and<br />\ncompletely void of any<br /><br />\nredeeming qualities.<br />\nMason's play is by no means a<br />\npolished work of art.
