Well,<br />\nno; but then just what is a constitution? A Constitution is a<br />\nbody of law and rules of procedure which has been accepted<br />\nby a certain majority of the<br />\nmembers of an organization. They<br />\nagree one and all as members of<br />\nthe organization to abide by that<br />\nconstitution and its provisions<br />\nuntil such time as they may be<br />\nchanged according to the provisions for amendment contained<br />\nin the constitution.<br />\nIt would seem that the members of the organization assume<br />\nthat all business of the organization will be carried on under the<br />\nconstitution. It would also appear<br />\nthat organizations and governments to best when operated under this system over the long run.<br />\nAfter observing the activities of<br />\nthe SAC, I would say that this<br />\ngroup agrees in principle with the<br />\nabove statements. In my opinion<br />\nIt has always been particularly<br />\n<br />\nHOMEWOOD, BALTIMORE, FEB. 17, 1956<br />\n<br />\nanxious that an organization have<br />\nan approved constitution and that<br />\nit follow that constitution. I could<br />\nnot agree more whole-heartedly<br />\nwith such policy.<br />\nIt is therefore with some confusion that I note the recent action\u2022of the SAC whereby it allowed<br />\n<br />\nWithout pointing out my personal opinions regarding the<br />\ndangers involved whenever one<br />\ngroup in any organization is allowed to suspend the constitution,<br />\nI would like to ask the SAC why<br />\nthis action was deemed so necessary that, in fact, it reversed its<br />\nheretofore policy in regards to the<br />\nvalue of a constitutional form of<br />\ngovernment.<br />\nThe Control Board of the Radio<br />\nStation seemed to think that it<br />\nwas necessary to take this action<br />\nbecause they did not want to wait<br />\nfor the required one week dc<br />\nmanded by the constitution before the final election could take<br />\nplace. However, concerning one of<br />\nthe posts to be filled, that one<br />\nweek had passed and that election could have carried out<br />\nimmediately and constitutionally!<br />\nThis was not done. In view of<br />\nthis fact, one can only wonder<br />\nwhat the real reasons were for the<br />\nsuspension of the constitution.<br />\nJOHN LAMBERT<br />\n<br />\nInto The China Shop<br />\nThe actual workings of a system of non-academic honor<br />\nhave long been suffering from a fuzzy indefiniteness. The Student Council has hovered tentatively in the<br />\nbackground with a vague constitutional provision giving<br />\nit, in the words of its president, \"jurisdiction over all undergraduates,\" but its activity has been potential, not actual,<br />\nDean Shaffer dealing individually with all such cases.<br />\nNow the situation has been altered by the need to<br />\ncollect reparations for the damage done at the ROTC<br />\nbuilding during the recent senior \"blast.\" The SC, conscious that the administration has been dissatisfied with<br />\nits inactivity, has hurriedly set up an ad hoc committee, to<br />\n\"investigate\" the situation and \"require\" the individuals<br />\nit has adjudged \"guilty\" to pay the costs of the vandalism.<br />\nthis is written, will play its proThis committee,<br />\nceedings entirely by ear no decisions have been made as to<br />\nhow \"guilt\" will be determined, what provision will be<br />\nmade for appeal, what percentage of the group is needed<br />\nto arrive at a verdict, how its decisions are to be carried<br />\nout, if the \"guilty\" person refuses to pay it lacks, in short,<br />\nany judicial character whatsoever, which is not surprising,<br />\nsince it is a fragment of an elected body, undertaking under<br />\nstress to clear up promptly a messy situation.<br />\nBut there is more involved here than the payment of<br />\na few plumber's and carpenter's bills. The attitude of<br />\nthe Dean's office toward student self-administration and<br />\ngovernment and the significance of the Student Council<br />\nitself are vitally concerned.<br />\nYet we cannot commend the SC for this departure<br />\nfrom its customary sloth. Rushing to the solution of a<br />\nparticular situation, they have overlooked two facets of<br />\nthe general problem: (1) that a little pre-concerted observation by SC members of situations where violations<br />\nof the Gentleman's Code are prone to occur could prevent these occasional incidents, and (2) that IF the SC<br />\nis to assert its long-dormant \"jurisdiction\" over undergraduates, it must first work out very carefully with the administration and the student body the judicial methods<br />\nand stated limitations under which the body, to which the SC<br />\ndelegates the responsibility for this new function, should<br />\noperate.<br />\n\u2022<br />\n<br />\n\u2022<br />\n<br />\nGet a<br />\nrecord-brealdng<br />\nrun for your<br />\nmoney!<br />\n<br />\nJr<br />\n<br />\nFamous<br />\n<br />\nOnly Chevrolet puts you in charge of the dynamite action and<br />\nsure-fire handling qualities it takes to break the Pikes Peak<br />\nrecord!

Never once has the<br />\ndropping of this program been<br />\nmade known or explained to the<br />\nstudents. The only way in which 7<br />\nfound that it had been dropped<br />\nis that I succeeded in finding the<br />\nchairman one night totally by ac<br />\ncident. He is still quite unknown<br />\nto my entry athletic chairman.<br />\nAs I understand the rationalizations offered for he suppression<br />\nof the program, they are three in<br />\nnumber. First, there is the objection that the athletic director was<br />\nnot swift in approving the program. This to my mind is inexcusable.<br />\n<br />\n\u2022-\u2022<br />\n\u2022\u2022<br />\n<br />\n\u2022<br />\n<br />\n\u2022\u2022\u2022<br />\nPO.<br />\n<br />\n\u2018,.<br />\n\u2022<br />\n<br />\nThe students pay for these facilities. The policy of the athletic<br />\nprogram is \"based upon principles<br />\nof ... wide participation\" (undergraduate catalogue, page 178). It<br />\nseems impossible to me that it<br />\ncosts a great deal to turn a key<br />\nin a lock to open the gym and then<br />\nagain to close it.<br />\nSecondly, there is a rumor that<br />\nit would be impossible to run an<br />\nequitable league. Certainly, this<br />\nis true if one began winter sports<br />\nsuch as basketball now (but wrestling?). But would this have been<br />\ntrue if the league had been started<br />\nin the fall? The idea of athletic<br />\ncompetition was discussed in social committee last year. At one of<br />\nthe first meetings this year, a<br />\nfaculty member promised every<br />\nhelp and support. Part of the<br />\nanswer must then lie in the administrative sloth of the students.<br />\n<br />\nno figures to support it, while on<br />\nthe other hand in the particular<br />\nentry I represent, over half signed<br />\nup for participation in basketball,<br />\nand many more have indicated interest.<br />\nAthletics are a normal and natural part of life. In failing to<br />\nembark upon a reasonable and<br />\npractical approcah to a dormifailtory athletic program, and in<br />\ning to carry what plans existed<br />\none<br />\nthrough, it seems to me that<br />\npressing<br />\nand<br />\nobvious<br />\nof the most<br />\nbeen<br />\nneeds of the community has<br />\nconignored. \"Noise must be<br />\nthe'<br />\nof<br />\n-word<br />\ntrolled,\" has been a by<br />\nseems<br />\nfaculty, and yet their hand<br />\ncontribto have been present and<br />\nthe<br />\nuting to the present goof.

Well,<br />\nno; but then just what is a constitution? A Constitution is a<br />\nbody of law and rules of procedure which has been accepted<br />\nby a certain majority of the<br />\nmembers of an organization. They<br />\nagree one and all as members of<br />\nthe organization to abide by that<br />\nconstitution and its provisions<br />\nuntil such time as they may be<br />\nchanged according to the provisions for amendment contained<br />\nin the constitution.<br />\nIt would seem that the members of the organization assume<br />\nthat all business of the organization will be carried on under the<br />\nconstitution. It would also appear<br />\nthat organizations and governments to best when operated under this system over the long run.<br />\nAfter observing the activities of<br />\nthe SAC, I would say that this<br />\ngroup agrees in principle with the<br />\nabove statements. In my opinion<br />\nIt has always been particularly<br /><br />\nHOMEWOOD, BALTIMORE, FEB. 17, 1956<br /><br />\nanxious that an organization have<br />\nan approved constitution and that<br />\nit follow that constitution. I could<br />\nnot agree more whole-heartedly<br />\nwith such policy.<br />\nIt is therefore with some confusion that I note the recent action\u2022of the SAC whereby it allowed<br /><br />\nWithout pointing out my personal opinions regarding the<br />\ndangers involved whenever one<br />\ngroup in any organization is allowed to suspend the constitution,<br />\nI would like to ask the SAC why<br />\nthis action was deemed so necessary that, in fact, it reversed its<br />\nheretofore policy in regards to the<br />\nvalue of a constitutional form of<br />\ngovernment.<br />\nThe Control Board of the Radio<br />\nStation seemed to think that it<br />\nwas necessary to take this action<br />\nbecause they did not want to wait<br />\nfor the required one week dc<br />\nmanded by the constitution before the final election could take<br />\nplace. However, concerning one of<br />\nthe posts to be filled, that one<br />\nweek had passed and that election could have carried out<br />\nimmediately and constitutionally!<br />\nThis was not done. In view of<br />\nthis fact, one can only wonder<br />\nwhat the real reasons were for the<br />\nsuspension of the constitution.<br />\nJOHN LAMBERT<br /><br />\nInto The China Shop<br />\nThe actual workings of a system of non-academic honor<br />\nhave long been suffering from a fuzzy indefiniteness. The Student Council has hovered tentatively in the<br />\nbackground with a vague constitutional provision giving<br />\nit, in the words of its president, \"jurisdiction over all undergraduates,\" but its activity has been potential, not actual,<br />\nDean Shaffer dealing individually with all such cases.<br />\nNow the situation has been altered by the need to<br />\ncollect reparations for the damage done at the ROTC<br />\nbuilding during the recent senior \"blast.\" The SC, conscious that the administration has been dissatisfied with<br />\nits inactivity, has hurriedly set up an ad hoc committee, to<br />\n\"investigate\" the situation and \"require\" the individuals<br />\nit has adjudged \"guilty\" to pay the costs of the vandalism.<br />\nthis is written, will play its proThis committee,<br />\nceedings entirely by ear no decisions have been made as to<br />\nhow \"guilt\" will be determined, what provision will be<br />\nmade for appeal, what percentage of the group is needed<br />\nto arrive at a verdict, how its decisions are to be carried<br />\nout, if the \"guilty\" person refuses to pay it lacks, in short,<br />\nany judicial character whatsoever, which is not surprising,<br />\nsince it is a fragment of an elected body, undertaking under<br />\nstress to clear up promptly a messy situation.<br />\nBut there is more involved here than the payment of<br />\na few plumber's and carpenter's bills. The attitude of<br />\nthe Dean's office toward student self-administration and<br />\ngovernment and the significance of the Student Council<br />\nitself are vitally concerned.<br />\nYet we cannot commend the SC for this departure<br />\nfrom its customary sloth. Rushing to the solution of a<br />\nparticular situation, they have overlooked two facets of<br />\nthe general problem: (1) that a little pre-concerted observation by SC members of situations where violations<br />\nof the Gentleman's Code are prone to occur could prevent these occasional incidents, and (2) that IF the SC<br />\nis to assert its long-dormant \"jurisdiction\" over undergraduates, it must first work out very carefully with the administration and the student body the judicial methods<br />\nand stated limitations under which the body, to which the SC<br />\ndelegates the responsibility for this new function, should<br />\noperate.<br />\n\u2022<br /><br />\n\u2022<br /><br />\nGet a<br />\nrecord-brealdng<br />\nrun for your<br />\nmoney!<br /><br />\nJr<br /><br />\nFamous<br /><br />\nOnly Chevrolet puts you in charge of the dynamite action and<br />\nsure-fire handling qualities it takes to break the Pikes Peak<br />\nrecord!

Never once has the<br />\ndropping of this program been<br />\nmade known or explained to the<br />\nstudents. The only way in which 7<br />\nfound that it had been dropped<br />\nis that I succeeded in finding the<br />\nchairman one night totally by ac<br />\ncident. He is still quite unknown<br />\nto my entry athletic chairman.<br />\nAs I understand the rationalizations offered for he suppression<br />\nof the program, they are three in<br />\nnumber. First, there is the objection that the athletic director was<br />\nnot swift in approving the program. This to my mind is inexcusable.<br /><br />\n\u2022-\u2022<br />\n\u2022\u2022<br /><br />\n\u2022<br /><br />\n\u2022\u2022\u2022<br />\nPO.<br /><br />\n\u2018,.<br />\n\u2022<br /><br />\nThe students pay for these facilities. The policy of the athletic<br />\nprogram is \"based upon principles<br />\nof ... wide participation\" (undergraduate catalogue, page 178). It<br />\nseems impossible to me that it<br />\ncosts a great deal to turn a key<br />\nin a lock to open the gym and then<br />\nagain to close it.<br />\nSecondly, there is a rumor that<br />\nit would be impossible to run an<br />\nequitable league. Certainly, this<br />\nis true if one began winter sports<br />\nsuch as basketball now (but wrestling?). But would this have been<br />\ntrue if the league had been started<br />\nin the fall? The idea of athletic<br />\ncompetition was discussed in social committee last year. At one of<br />\nthe first meetings this year, a<br />\nfaculty member promised every<br />\nhelp and support. Part of the<br />\nanswer must then lie in the administrative sloth of the students.<br /><br />\nno figures to support it, while on<br />\nthe other hand in the particular<br />\nentry I represent, over half signed<br />\nup for participation in basketball,<br />\nand many more have indicated interest.<br />\nAthletics are a normal and natural part of life. In failing to<br />\nembark upon a reasonable and<br />\npractical approcah to a dormifailtory athletic program, and in<br />\ning to carry what plans existed<br />\none<br />\nthrough, it seems to me that<br />\npressing<br />\nand<br />\nobvious<br />\nof the most<br />\nbeen<br />\nneeds of the community has<br />\nconignored. \"Noise must be<br />\nthe'<br />\nof<br />\n-word<br />\ntrolled,\" has been a by<br />\nseems<br />\nfaculty, and yet their hand<br />\ncontribto have been present and<br />\nthe<br />\nuting to the present goof. But<br />\nthis:<br />\nproblem is essence is<br />\nfor<br />\nThrough whom, for whom, and<br />\nathwhat do the facilities of the<br />\nletic department exist, and whY<br />\ninare they not fulfilling their<br />\nbut<br />\ntent? The answer is anything<br /><br />\nLastly, it is objected that there<br />\nis not enough interest. This is an flattering.<br />\nallegation without fact. There are<br /><br />\nREUBEN R.
