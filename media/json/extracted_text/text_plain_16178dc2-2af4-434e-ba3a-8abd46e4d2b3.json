Haying passed through its<br />\nfirst decade, Johns Hopkins Television has held its own against<br />\ntop competition, including Milton<br />\nBerle, Arthur Godfrey, and the<br />\n$64,000 Question, collecting two<br />\nPeabody citations in the Urocess.<br />\nThe new concept that Johns<br />\nHopkins brought to commercial<br />\ntelevision was entertainment, in<br />\nits broadest sense, with an educational value. Refusing to bow<br />\nto old taboos left over from<br />\nradio, Hopkins did not tone down<br />\nthe level of its programming to<br />\nthat of a 12 year old, but presented vital information to a<br />\nmature<br />\naudience.<br />\nAttracting<br />\nviewers against top competition<br />\nand presenting educational material with the lowest budget on<br />\ntelevision has been a difficult<br />\nproblem for Lynn Poole and his<br />\nstaff.<br />\nAmong their answers to the<br />\nproblem has been catchy pro-<br />\n<br />\ngram titles: \"X-Ray, the Super<br />\nSleuth\" was a program dealing<br />\nwith group therapy in psychi.:<br />\natry; \"Convicted by Microscope\"<br />\nshowed the use of science in<br />\npolice work.<br />\nHopkins TV uses other traditional eyecatchers as well.

A recent \"File 7\" program<br />\non the private life of Medieval<br />\nknights, narrated by Dr. Sidney<br />\nPainter, depicted bawdy love<br />\nscenes. A \"Science Review\" show,<br />\n\"Are You Too Fat?\", opened with<br />\na girl mounting a scale With<br />\nostensibly only to towel wrapped<br />\naround her. As she stepped on<br />\nthe scale, the towel fell, revealing a chemise. But the audience<br />\nattention was, by then, assured.<br />\nThe first Hopkins series, \"The<br />\nJohns Hopkins Science Review,\"<br />\nran on CBS until 1955. The first<br />\nshow, entitled \"All About The<br />\nAtom\", featured Dr. Franco<br />\nRasetti, who pioneered in atomic<br />\nresearch with Enrico Fermi in<br />\nItaly. Since then the program<br />\nhas featured such guests as<br />\n<br />\nWerner von Braun, Admiral<br />\nLewis Strauss, House Speaker<br />\nSam Rayburn, Sir Alexander<br />\nFleming, the discoverer of peni\"<br />\ncillin, and Dr. Gunther Evans,<br />\nthe Director of the Library of<br />\nCongress.

Haying passed through its<br />\nfirst decade, Johns Hopkins Television has held its own against<br />\ntop competition, including Milton<br />\nBerle, Arthur Godfrey, and the<br />\n$64,000 Question, collecting two<br />\nPeabody citations in the Urocess.<br />\nThe new concept that Johns<br />\nHopkins brought to commercial<br />\ntelevision was entertainment, in<br />\nits broadest sense, with an educational value. Refusing to bow<br />\nto old taboos left over from<br />\nradio, Hopkins did not tone down<br />\nthe level of its programming to<br />\nthat of a 12 year old, but presented vital information to a<br />\nmature<br />\naudience.<br />\nAttracting<br />\nviewers against top competition<br />\nand presenting educational material with the lowest budget on<br />\ntelevision has been a difficult<br />\nproblem for Lynn Poole and his<br />\nstaff.<br />\nAmong their answers to the<br />\nproblem has been catchy pro-<br /><br />\ngram titles: \"X-Ray, the Super<br />\nSleuth\" was a program dealing<br />\nwith group therapy in psychi.:<br />\natry; \"Convicted by Microscope\"<br />\nshowed the use of science in<br />\npolice work.<br />\nHopkins TV uses other traditional eyecatchers as well. A program on the effects of sunburn<br />\nopened with a beach scene showing several strong, handsome<br />\nmen and attractive, skimply clad<br />\ngirls. A recent \"File 7\" program<br />\non the private life of Medieval<br />\nknights, narrated by Dr. Sidney<br />\nPainter, depicted bawdy love<br />\nscenes. A \"Science Review\" show,<br />\n\"Are You Too Fat?\", opened with<br />\na girl mounting a scale With<br />\nostensibly only to towel wrapped<br />\naround her. As she stepped on<br />\nthe scale, the towel fell, revealing a chemise. But the audience<br />\nattention was, by then, assured.<br />\nThe first Hopkins series, \"The<br />\nJohns Hopkins Science Review,\"<br />\nran on CBS until 1955. The first<br />\nshow, entitled \"All About The<br />\nAtom\", featured Dr. Franco<br />\nRasetti, who pioneered in atomic<br />\nresearch with Enrico Fermi in<br />\nItaly. Since then the program<br />\nhas featured such guests as<br /><br />\nWerner von Braun, Admiral<br />\nLewis Strauss, House Speaker<br />\nSam Rayburn, Sir Alexander<br />\nFleming, the discoverer of peni\"<br />\ncillin, and Dr. Gunther Evans,<br />\nthe Director of the Library of<br />\nCongress.
