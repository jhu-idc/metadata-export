CRAMER<br />\n<br />\nThe Academic Council has recommended to<br />\nPresident Gordon that Hopkins admit women<br />\nundergraduates for the Fall term of next year.<br />\nThe Council's recommendations, passed in<br />\nits Wednesday meeting, call for GOrdon to<br />\nappoint a \"task force committee\" to report<br />\nto the Academic Council with full details on<br />\nthe institution of general undergraduate coeducation.<br />\nUntil this task force completes its work ,it<br />\nwill not be known how many women will be<br />\nadmitted and in which classes, or if the total<br />\nsize of the undergraduate body will be changed.<br />\n\"Some Women\"<br />\nThe Council, however, did specify that<br />\nit wanted \"some women\" to be admitted for<br />\nenrollment next year. The statement released<br />\nby Dean Kimball's office yesterday said that<br />\nit was the Council's intent that Hopkins \"proceed as rapidly as feasible to a significant proportion of females in the undergraduate body.\"<br />\nCouncil members were generally unwilling to<br />\ntalk about the decision yesterday. The members<br />\nof the task force have not been named by<br />\nthe President. The recommendations of the<br />\nAcademic Council must be approved by Gordon<br />\nand the Board of Trustees before they may be<br />\nacted upon. Although Gordon was unavailable<br />\nfor comment yesterday, it is assumed that he<br />\nwill react favorably to the recommendations.<br />\nThe next meeting of the Board of Trustees will<br />\ntake place on November 10.<br />\nThe task force will consist of two members<br />\nof the faculty, two undergraduates, one rep-<br />\n<br />\nresentative from Dean Kimball's office, and one<br />\nrepresentative from the Office of Robert F.<br />\nKerley, the Vice-President for Administration.<br />\n\"Soon,\"Very Soon<br />\n<br />\nDirector of Admissions William Brinldey said that<br />\nthat he would meet the committee's recommendations \"soon\" in' order to do an effective job of recruiting for the Fall term. \"I'm<br />\nnot ready to move until I get the answers,\"<br />\nhe said. Another administrative source said<br />\nthat the report of the task force would probably<br />\nhave to be submitted by November 15 for<br />\ncoeducation to be successfully implemented<br />\nnext year.<br />\nBrinkley was enthusiastic about the possibilities which coeducation would provide for<br />\nHopkins. He said he wanted to see it become<br />\npart of \"our total program.\" He also stated<br />\nthat it might benefit the recruiting efforts of<br />\nthe ,University by making Hopkins more attractive to men. Ronald 0 wens, Assistant Director<br />\nof Admissions, said that the coeducation move<br />\nwould indicate a general improvement in the<br />\nsocial conditions at Hopkins.<br />\nAlready Interviewing<br />\nBrinkley stated that the University was already receiving letters from women. His staff<br />\nhas already been talking to female high school<br />\nseniors. However, he stated, that he also wished<br />\nto enroll transfer students. \"I think we could<br />\nget some fine young ladies through transfer,\"<br />\nhe said. No one was willing to speculate on<br />\nhow many women would be enrolled in each<br />\nclass. Presumably, the women will enroll in<br />\n<br />\nthe Freshmen class more than any other.<br />\nAccording to Homewood House sources,President Gordon views the task force as responsible<br />\nfor reporting on every aspect of the changes<br />\nrequired for coeducation. This indicates that<br />\nthe committee will look into everything from<br />\n\u2022alterations in the curriculum to placing<br />\n\"men\" and \"women\" signs on the doors of<br />\nlavatories.<br />\nAdministrators have been looking into the<br />\nproblems and possibilities of undergraduate coeducation for some time. Recently, the<br />\nAcademic Council affirmed undergraduate coeducation \"in principle.\"<br />\n<br />\nNo Merger<br />\nThere had been discussion of the feasibility<br />\nof merging with Goucher College instead of<br />\nadmitting women to Hopkins. It was felt by<br />\nsome that because Goucher already had all of<br />\nthe facilities which women require, Hopkins<br />\nwould be wiser to attempt the merger.<br />\nThe faculty at Hopkins, however, was largely<br />\nagainst the move. There was a fear that faculty<br />\nmembers here would lose the control which<br />\nthey exercise over curriculum and program requirements if the university merged with<br />\nGoucher. Many faculty members were upset<br />\nover the types of courses offered in the<br />\nGoucher-Hopkins cooperative\u2022program.<br />\nIn addition, problems of transportation between the two campuses would have proved<br />\ndifficult to eliminate. Had Hopkins and Goucher<br />\nmerged, the university would have accrued no<br />\nfinancial advantages. Goucher's endowment is<br />\nsmall compared to that of Hopkins.<br />\n<br />\nNews-Letter<br />\nVol. LXXIV<br />\n<br />\nHOMEWOOD, BALTIMORE<br />\n<br />\nOCTOBER 31, 1969<br />\n<br />\n74th YEAR<br />\n<br />\nWald Scores Military As Symposium Opens<br />\nBy ARTHUR LEVINE<br />\nDr. George Wald, Nobel laureate<br />\nin Medicine and Physiology, sharply attacked American militarism<br />\nat the keynote address of the 1968<br />\nMilton S. Eisenhower Symposium.<br />\nAn overflow crowd at Shriver<br />\nHall last Tuesday heard Dr. Wald<br />\nspeak on \"The Business of Life or<br />\nthe Business of Death,\" as he<br />\ncriticized expensive weapons systems, high defense spending, and<br />\nan escalating arms race.<br />\nAs the first of a prominent group<br />\nof speakers and panelists brought<br />\nto Hopkins to speak on the Symposium topic of \"The United<br />\nStates in the 1970's: Arms Race or<br />\nArms Control,\" Dr. Wald outlined<br />\nhis opposition to the militaryindustrial complex.<br />\nHis speech was enthusiastically<br />\nreceived by the large student audience, although there was some<br />\nrestlessness near the end of his long<br />\npresentation.<br />\n\"What we have to deal with today in American militarism is that<br />\nit is primarily a business.

It ipatnotism,1<br />\none approaches it as a business<br />\nthat it all becomes reasonably<br />\nclear,\" he remarked.<br />\nDr. Wald pointed to the deployment of the ABM as an example of<br />\nthe \"Business of Death.\" He noted<br />\n<br />\nthe futile opposition of physicists,<br />\ncomputer specialists, former Presidential science advisers, and<br />\nother experts to the deployment<br />\nof the Safeguard system. He charged that many of the scientists who<br />\ndid support the ABM were connected with institutions like the<br />\nHudson Institute that received De-<br />\n<br />\nfense Department funds.<br />\nClaiming that the ABM was both<br />\nunworkable and useless, Wald said,<br />\n\"It wasn't science, it wasn't military, so what was it?\" He paused,<br />\nand stated, \"12 billion dollars in<br />\ndefense contracts.\" Wald observed<br />\nthat the estimated cost of the<br />\nABM has risen in the last year<br />\nyear from 5.5 billion dollars to 12<br />\nbillion dollars, and, he commented,<br />\n\"The end is not in sight.\"<br />\nMIRV Worse<br />\nThe Harvard Professor of Biology<br />\ncontinued by declaring that the<br />\nMIRV (Multiple Independently<br />\nTargetable Re-entry Vehicles) is far<br />\nmore dangerous than ABM. He<br />\njokingly commented on the name<br />\nof the multiple warheads by saying, \"You all know about vehicles.<br />\nWhy, except for a few independently targetable Warheads, this is<br />\njust like a Chevy.\"<br />\nOur present stockpile of single<br />\nwarhead weapons is too large now,<br />\nhe said, and the use of MIRV<br />\nwould even be more foolish. \"Re(Continued on page 4)<br />\n<br />\n\fOct. 31, 1969<br />\n<br />\nNEWS\u2014LETTER<br />\n<br />\nPAGE 2<br />\n<br />\n'Start At Home;Says Sargent Shriver<br />\nBy PETER KATES<br />\nStaff Member.<br />\n\"A new union of men is necessary in<br />\nthis country. The place to start is at<br />\nhome--not just in the United States, in<br />\ngeneral- but right here on the campuses<br />\nof our universities.\"<br />\nReading from a prepared text, titled<br />\n\"From Hair to Eternity,\" a poised, selfconfident Sargent Shriver urged college<br />\ncampuses<br />\nto get involved with the<br />\ncommunity.<br />\nQuoting Paul Goodman,the Ambassador to France mourned that \"for the first<br />\ntime in recorded history the mention of<br />\ncountry, community, place, has lost its<br />\npower to animate.\"<br />\nHe raised his tone in asking \"What<br />\nexcuse is there for Columbia versus Harlem, Stanford versus Palo Alto, Yale<br />\nversus New Haven\"?<br />\nDeparting<br />\nmomentarily from the<br />\nwritten text, the graying Ambassador<br />\nadopted a more natural tone and answered<br />\nthat. \"The community must be linked to<br />\nthe university. College students must become practitioners.\"<br />\nWith<br />\nPresident Gordon stoical!)<br />\nsitting by him on the stage, the Kennedy<br />\nin-law observed that the trouble in<br />\ntodays' universities is that \"college<br />\npresidents, when they are not Marshals<br />\nor mediators have become fund raisers<br />\ninstead of educators.\" \"Why shouldn't<br />\nwe today endow our universities\", he<br />\ndemanded.<br />\n<br />\nAll Who Qualify<br />\nThe Ambassador urged that instead<br />\nof building new carriers and jet planes,<br />\nthe government support \"all who quality\"<br />\nand want to go to college.<br />\nReturning to the main theme of the<br />\nlecture, the Ambassador skeptically asked \"Would our universities if they<br />\n<br />\nbecame the center of the neighborhood<br />\nbe willing to take everyone in\"?<br />\nHe recommended that studenfs and<br />\nprofessors go out into the community<br />\nand gain practical experience. Complaining that his years at Yale were<br />\nthat<br />\n\"sheltered,\" Shriver promised<br />\ncommunity action would be rewarding<br />\nand<br />\nfor both neighborhood residents<br />\nuniversity students and faculty.<br />\n<br />\nViolins?<br />\nElegantly attired in a black tuxedo,<br />\nhe metaphorically compared mankind to<br />\na great orchestra. \"It would be paltry<br />\ninstrument at best, if it were composed<br />\nonly of violins. \"Today we are harrasshave<br />\ned by discordant notes, let us<br />\nharmony.\"<br />\nBorn in Westminster, Maryland in<br />\n1915, R.

Kennedy<br />\n<br />\nSargent Shriver called for a \"new union of men\" in his speech on campus last Friday.<br />\nthat \"we are disliked because we are at<br />\nwar. We are feared because we are a<br />\nviolent people, and we are disdained because the French think of us as becoming cold, impersonal ciphers in a faceless society.<br />\n\"Let us,\" begged the Ambassador,<br />\nin concluding his speech, \"dedicate ourselves to a new union-net of nations, but<br />\n<br />\nbecame assistant<br />\nEnterprises,<br />\nand<br />\nmanager of the Merchandise<br />\ngeneral<br />\nMart in Chicago in 1948. While living<br />\nin Chicago Shriver was appointed Director of the Peace Corps, and in 1964<br />\nwas made head of the office of Economic<br />\nOpportunity and Special Assistant to the<br />\nPresident. in 1968, Shriver, who is<br />\nmarried to the former Eunice Mary<br />\nKennedy; was named United<br />\nStates<br />\nAmbassador to France.<br />\nCommenting from his experience as<br />\nAmbassador, Shriver told the<br />\nlarge<br />\naudience that \"in France, Americans are<br />\nmore popular today than they have been<br />\nat least for the last decade.\" However,<br />\nhe did not see this as the trend throughout the world.

Only the bridging of<br />\nscience and our soul will set us free.\"<br />\nThe Ambassador received a standing ovation.<br />\nAfter the lecture, the Ambassador<br />\ntook questions from the audience. Asked about the future role of state and local<br />\ngovernments, in this country,the former<br />\nhead of the war on poverty echoed his<br />\nspeech: \"The more decentralized the<br />\nstate and local governments, the better<br />\noff we are.\" He pointed out that while<br />\nthere can be \"a terrific amount of local<br />\nresponsibility, it's difficult to maintain<br />\nlocal identity in New York City.\"<br />\nAsked<br />\nabout his attitude towards<br />\n<br />\n/CAMPUS NOTES<br />\n<br />\nstudent power in the universities,the relaxed, Ambassador avoided giving a<br />\ndefinite answer, stating only that \"each<br />\nuniversity has to resolve that question<br />\nfor itself.\"<br />\nWhen asked for his attitude towards<br />\nthe November and October moratoriums,<br />\nthe Marylander commented that \"I think<br />\nit is better for students to have an active<br />\nrelationship. I am in favor of any kind of<br />\npeaceful demonstration about important<br />\npublic policy.\"<br />\nShriver also used the questionanswer period to strike a blow at government bureaucracy. \"Did you every try<br />\nto buy a stamp at five past five, he asked<br />\nwith a cynical smile; \"That's because<br />\nthat guy has a monopoly,\" he chuckled.<br />\nWhen asked his opinion on President<br />\nNixon's comment that the moratoriums<br />\nwould have no affect on him,the Ambassador defended the President. He explained that the statement was probably misunderstood.<br />\nWhat he really meant,<br />\nShriver<br />\nexplained, was that \"the<br />\nPresident has a responsibility to do what<br />\nhe thinks is right even if it is unpopular.\"<br />\n<br />\nllappeithq<br />\n<br />\nMARCH FOR MARYLAND<br />\n<br />\nBLEED-IN<br />\n<br />\nMarchers in the Maryland delegation<br />\nfor the March Against Death (November<br />\n13-15) and marshalls for the Death<br />\nMarch and the March on Washington<br />\n(November 15) are needed.

He remarked,<br />\nBut don't let that get you down. Simultaneously we can kill 140 million<br />\nRussians. And that's with a single warhead.\"<br />\nHe added, \"The present plan is to tool<br />\nthem up to MIRV's. Whenthat'sfinished,<br />\nwe will have multiplied our present<br />\nstockpile by five.

He noted that one out of every<br />\nten American workers is working on<br />\nsome sort of defense contract. \"That's<br />\nwhy the AFL-CIO is so interested in<br />\nkeeping up the level of our armaments,\"<br />\nhe said, \"and indeed they approve of the<br />\nVietnam war.\" He stated that even the<br />\nmost innocent scientific experimentation<br />\nwas always under Defense scrutiny because of the possibility that it might be<br />\n<br />\nexploited for use in war. He charged<br />\nthat this influence of the military<br />\nwas<br />\nseriously<br />\nundermining the American<br />\nsystem of checks and balances. \"We<br />\nare,\" he said, \"faced with an interlocking directorate that involves all components of American life and all aspects of<br />\nthe government.\"<br />\nThe 139 members of both Houses who<br />\nhave reserve commissions and the close<br />\nties between the Pentagon and the defense<br />\nindustries were pointed to as examples<br />\nof this \"interlocking directorate\".

Dr. Wald noted that Lockheed<br />\nhas been showered with lucrative contracts, especially the controversial C-5A<br />\ntransport plane.

The<br />\nupcoming Strategic Arms Limitation<br />\nTalks are only dealing with controlled<br />\nescalation. When we can multiply warheads we will no longer be able to make<br />\naerial inspections, as we do know, and<br />\nthat means the end of arms limitations.\"<br />\nDr. Wald said the building of weapons<br />\nsystems instead of consumer goods was<br />\nresulting in a negative balance of trade.<br />\nHe added that industries should orient<br />\nthemselves to activities that will fill<br />\nhe<br />\nimportant human needs. \"Or,\"<br />\nwarned, \"we'll end up eating those<br />\nMIRV's.\"<br />\n<br />\nWho's Moral?<br />\nThe only overt opposition to Wald or<br />\nto the views expressed in his address<br />\nafter the question and answer<br />\ncame<br />\nperiod, when a group of ten students<br />\ngathered around the lecturer on stage.<br />\nRichard Wilson, a graduate student in<br />\nInternational Relations threaded his way<br />\nthrough the group to confront Wald with<br />\nwhat he termed the speech's \"frivolity.\"<br />\nWilson angrily accused Wald of telling<br />\njokes instead of dealing with substantive<br />\nissues, attributing the lack to insufficient<br />\nmoral concern. Wilson stated that Wald<br />\nhad brought none of his expertise to bear<br />\non the matters discussed. Wald, at first,<br />\ncalmly attempted to explain that his field<br />\nof expertise was the biochemical aspects<br />\nof vision and had nothing to dowith arms<br />\ncontrol or defense policy.<br />\nWhen Wilson persisted in berating the<br />\nlecturer, Wald became annoyed and stated that the could have spoken on biochemistry \"and demonstrated all the expertise you goddamn well would want.\"<br />\nHe added,\"But I sure as hell would rather<br />\ntalk about this!\"<br />\nWald cited a conversation he had with<br />\na government representative who asked<br />\nhim to contribute to a project developing<br />\ntemporary blinding agents.

I'm saying we can reduce the<br />\nmilitary by 98% and negotiate the rest.\"<br />\nPike, however, said, \"I happen to think<br />\nwe need a military establishment.\"<br />\nMarcus responded, \"My argument is<br />\nthat the military establishment,including<br />\nthe corporations, unions, and universities, has virtually inverted the value<br />\nsystem of those who are not involved in<br />\ndecision-making.\"<br />\nIn response to a question on whether<br />\ndefense work was profitable, L.

And it's only 3%of<br />\nthe Gross National Product.\"<br />\n<br />\nDecisions, Decisions<br />\nRaskin then commented on decisionmaking, and made a proposal to submit<br />\nthe budget to a vote. \"The people who<br />\noperate at the beginning of the decisionmaking system really decide the frame of<br />\nreference the rest of us have to operate<br />\nwithin. The Congressman votes within the<br />\ncontext that you, Mr. Davis, are laying<br />\ndown.

However, he did maintain as a major factor his \"total frustration about getting<br />\nthings done in the Student Council.\"<br />\nDean Rudoy, also a junior class representative, had resigned a month earlier. He said that personal reasons were<br />\nresponsible for his resignation. At the<br />\ntime, a member of the junior class<br />\nWho was asked to fill the vacancy criticized the Council, and refused to take<br />\nthe position.<br />\nBetcher plans to spend his time now on<br />\nthe Student Association. He indicated<br />\nthat he felt that this would be a more useful way for him to spend his time. He<br />\nsaid that the Student Council was \"too<br />\nmuch of a hassle\" with too little reward.<br />\nHe also indicated his intentions -of<br />\ncontinuing to work for a University Senate, though in a capacity outside of the<br />\nCouncil. \"The extinction of the Student<br />\nCouncil is what I look forward to,\"<br />\nBetcher maintained. \"The entire Student<br />\nCouncil is absurd in its structure.\"<br />\nBetcher insists that the University<br />\nSenate is the answer to the problem,<br />\nin that it is not isolated from the students, the faculty, or the administration,<br />\nas are most of the present governance<br />\nstructures.<br />\nAt the Monday night meeting of the<br />\n<br />\nStudent Council, Betcher had intended to<br />\nread a prepared statement on his reasons<br />\nfor resigning. Instead, he simply stated<br />\nthat the \"rumors you have all heard about<br />\nme resigning from the SC are true. I<br />\nresign. I guess that's about it.\" He then<br />\nclosed his notebook and walked out of the<br />\nmeeting.<br />\nIssueless Elections<br />\nIn the letter which he had intended to<br />\nread, he wrote that \"the structure by<br />\nwhich the university is governed is inimical to the interests of students, and to<br />\nthe interests of the university community as a whole.

For the first time in several years, issues are being discussed which<br />\nwill significantly affect the quality of life for the members of the freshman<br />\nclass. The issues of gym requirements, dormitory regulations, and the<br />\nlarger questions about the role of the students in the university are all<br />\nimportant.<br />\nThe election has an even larger significance as it will do much to<br />\ndetermine the character of the Hopkins campus. For all intents and purposes, the campus is the bailiwick of the dormitory residents and the<br />\nfreshmen comprise a majority of these students. The tone set by the new<br />\nleadership of the freshman class will make itself felt in the dormitory<br />\ncomplex and on the campus as a whole. In this way, the upcoming elections will affect all of Homewood as well as the class which does the voting.<br />\nAmong the four candidates for the Presidency of the class, there is<br />\nlittle difference as to the views on the issues of the campaign. However,<br />\nthere are great differences regarding the manner in which the candidates<br />\nPropose to go about achieving their goals. Two of the candidates have not<br />\nspecified how they would approach the problems and questions which<br />\nconfront their class. Steve Jones and Allen Ross are only too willing to<br />\ndeal in abstract policies and their attitudes on various issues. However,<br />\nthey have little to say with regard to the concrete efforts they will make to<br />\nachieve their goals. David Charry differs in that he has evolved a set of<br />\ntactics which he would use to effect the changes he favors.<br />\nHowever, the tactics which Charry has developed are insufficient and<br />\nill-reasoned. He suggests that if Dean Kimball does not respond to the<br />\nrequests of the freshmen that the gym requirement be abolished, the<br />\nfreshmen don their gym shorts and iilant themselves in Kimball's office<br />\nuntil something is done. In another instance, Chaffy suggested that students threaten to visit their old high schools and dissuade potential applicants from coming to Hopkins. These tactics are cute, but experience<br />\nhas shown that they achieve little at Hopkins. Charry has not made an<br />\neffective study of the way decisions are reached at Homewood, and most<br />\nof the tactics which he outlines are of the \"last-ditch effort\" variety.<br />\nAdministrators rarely allow anything to get to the last ditch. The most<br />\neffective work is done before tactics of confrontation are called for.<br />\nOnly one candidate seems to us to have carefully observed the decision-making process at Homewood. Charlie Trueheart is like Charry in<br />\nthat he does not confine himself to abstractions about what the freshmen<br />\n<br />\nctv cir moor<br />\nsERT:ZS lq6c1<br />\n<br />\nA 12AWE TO\\<br />\n<br />\nThe first week of the Milton S.

The success of this year's program is directly attributable to<br />\nthe efforts of four juniors, who conceived, organized and prdmoted this<br />\nyear's Symposium.<br />\nSteve Mahinka, Bill Betcher, Roger Faxon and Dean Rudoy worked<br />\nthrough the summer and the start of the present school year to bring the<br />\nimpressive list of speakers and participants to Hopkins.<br />\nThe Symposium stands as a model for university programs which<br />\nbenefit the entire community.

The emulation of<br />\ntypes is not in itself deplorable; what is deplorable is<br />\nthat the types to be copied do not even live in the present.<br />\nThe permissive parents of a generation tired of<br />\nwar and poverty sent us to the universities to act out<br />\nthe emotional conflict between parent and child which<br />\nthey never gave us. As a result, we play nursery school<br />\ngames with administrators and at the same time we are<br />\ncaptives of a social ethos which worships youth.<br />\n<br />\nFolk Hero No. 1<br />\nThe hippy, including the many that imitate him, is<br />\npurportedly the vanguard of the future, but actually is<br />\nmerely the anachronistic hero of old, slightly modified.<br />\nAs a result, he wears the costume of the WWI doughdoy, the headband of the American Indian, the sideburns of the western Plainsman or the smock of the<br />\nFrench Bohemian painter. He couples an antique figurine appearance with the noral . position that life in<br />\nany society that demands intelligence is a waste of<br />\nprecious time. \"There is as much surface presence<br />\nand internal absence,\" writes Aldridge, \"as one would<br />\nexpect to find in the most promising junior executive<br />\nat General Motors.\"<br />\nIn an era of interest in communication among the<br />\nyoung, and the era of most need for substantive personal<br />\ninteraction, the hippy offers us a life that is \"all a<br />\nmatter of soul speaking to soul, lovers passionately<br />\nsweating skin to skin, blown minds exchanging psychedelic<br />\nmash-notes--non thoughts floating in non words between<br />\nnon-entities.\" Empty minds, fearful of intellectural<br />\nstimuli, always capitulate.<br />\n<br />\nFolk Hero No. 2<br />\nThe activist type is a man of action and little else.<br />\nThe important thing to the activist is not the problem<br />\nto which he addresses himself but the riotous fervor<br />\n<br />\nNever Suffered<br />\n<br />\nemployed to effect its solution. Individual action against<br />\nreal social ills is sacrificed to the mass hysteria<br />\ndemanding that someone, somewhere, somehow, perfect the world before we are forced to enter it. The<br />\ninstant gratification of the nursery carried all the way<br />\nto the university (because our parents let us do their<br />\nliving for them), finally meets some authority against<br />\nwhich we rebel, often for no real reason. Since everyone tells us how very smart we are, no one has to do any<br />\nmind-work, only mouth-work.<br />\nIt is the ultimate paradox, however, that we offer<br />\na materialistic solution to very problem in a society<br />\nwhich we accuse of gross materialism. Worst of all,<br />\nwe criticize the inhuman quality of encroaching technology<br />\nin the \"New -Speak\" of technology. We do not solve<br />\nproblems in rhetoric, but of course that is the master<br />\nstrategy. For if the problems were solved we would<br />\nbe out of work.<br />\nIt is not that we haven't recognized legitimate social<br />\nills, it is simply that we create an emotional social<br />\nenvironment which makes their solution more remote.<br />\n<br />\nWe've Never Suffered<br />\nYouth today, above all else, suffers the ignominy<br />\nof never having suffered. We had no depression to spawn<br />\nmaterial want; no war to instill in us an emotional<br />\nattachment to country.<br />\nThe demand everywhere is for relevance. However,<br />\nit would require some thought to realize that after our<br />\ntechnology begins to master our environment(relevance),<br />\nwe will exist in an atmosphere of cultural atrophy because<br />\nof our insistance that all learning must relate to the<br />\npresent.<br />\nIf we adulate the hippy who lives a sensuous existence or the activist who acts in a mental vacuum,<br />\nwhere will the intellect reside? One could fear the polarization of all youth into two extreme types; Vegetable<br />\nMan and Violent Mechanical Man, the future's models<br />\nor the present folk heroes. Much depends on the extent<br />\nto which we believe our own vacuous rhetoric; if we<br />\nfollow types or if we reassert individual identity and<br />\naction. If our concern is employment of blacks, we<br />\n<br />\nhad better strive for those positions in society which<br />\ncan offer employment.<br />\n<br />\nYawning at the Mirror<br />\nThere is much concern as to whether we are up<br />\nto the challenge. We are very bored, undoubtedly more<br />\nso than housewives mesmerized by daytime television.<br />\nIf the problem is a lack of identity, it is perplexing to<br />\nsee how this is overcome simply the assertion of primitive masculinity in the form of mass protest. At the<br />\npersonal level we are, of course, convinced of our total<br />\nindividuality, unaware that personal expression, today, is<br />\nobviously a mirror image of mass expression.<br />\nWe are mostly appearance, clawing at the past in<br />\nthe guise of future quest. It is confusing how we think<br />\nourselves more individual by exchanging one costume<br />\nfor another or by our desire to shock instead of to<br />\nplacate. The General Motors type, for all his emptiness,<br />\nknows where he is going and does his job well. We do<br />\nnothing well, nor want to. Our choice is between careers<br />\nthat are more often than not \"two identical glasses of<br />\nsour milk.\" The ethos of instant gratification puts the<br />\nperception of acheivement beyond the<br />\npresent into<br />\ncategories, all of which are horribly establishmentarian.<br />\nIf we commit ourselves we are a part of some system,<br />\nsome closted circuit. We are not dedicated to anything<br />\nand would rather do something boring to collect some<br />\npay than settle into one of those terrible niches. It<br />\nwould negate the safety of mass orthodoxy.<br />\nWe are very religious. We speak of others and the<br />\nquality of otherness, never, of course, being alone long<br />\nenough to comprehend such a thing. Our sexual mores<br />\ncenter on ejaculation and cannot be confined to that neat<br />\nlittle box called the family, whether or not it is the basic<br />\nanimal and human structure of socity.<br />\nIt is dangerous to criticize youth. When some of<br />\nthose adults which are not captivated by us do so, they<br />\nare encroaching on some psychological Godhead, the<br />\nvery personality of society.<br />\n<br />\nr\u2014=Our American Heritage<br />\n<br />\n'Cleveland's Major Role Is Minor One I<br />\nBy ED MENDELSOHN<br />\nThe position of former President<br />\nGrover Cleveland in the Alton B.Parker<br />\nbut<br />\ncampaign was outwardly minor,<br />\nimplicitly of great significance. One<br />\ncan point to Cleveland's limited campaigning to demonstrate the proposition<br />\nthat he lacked an important position,<br />\nbut Parker himself would lack importance if contributions to the campaign<br />\nwere measured by campaigning.<br />\nIn<br />\ngeneral, there can be little doubt of<br />\nCleveland's postion as the foremost<br />\nsupporter of the Parker campaign.<br />\nCleveland at this point was sixtyseven years old and, as he said, unable to open his mind to another term<br />\nof the Presidency. He was living in<br />\nPrinceton, New Jersey, and was a trustee of the local University.(The University President was Dr.Woodrow Wilson).<br />\nHe wrote the matter normally expected<br />\nof former Presidents; articles defending his conduct in the crises of his own<br />\nadministration, and rhetorical gessamer<br />\nurging the American people to be patriotic and observe their national holidays. To the conservative portion of<br />\nthe population, Cleveland was a venerable statesman enjoying a dignified retirement. The New York<br />\nTimes<br />\ncontinually declared him the<br />\nbest<br />\nDemocratic President since Jefferson,<br />\nimmensely preferable to the younger<br />\nDemocrats associated with, and including, Bryan.<br />\n<br />\nConsiderably More Popular<br />\nHowever, Cleveland had been considerably more popular with the conservative organs than with the succeeding<br />\nleaders of his own party. In 1896, the<br />\nBryan convention declined to pass even<br />\na perfunctory resolution applauding the<br />\nIncumbent Democratic President,Cleveland retaliated .in several ways. He<br />\ndelivered a eulogy for Bryan's success-<br />\n<br />\nful opponent, President McKinley. His<br />\nletters describe Bryan's form of politics<br />\nas \"fool business.\"<br />\nCleveland's attacks on Bryan are only<br />\nrarely characterized by precision. He<br />\ndid not make a flat statement that it<br />\nwas improper for a Presidential nominee<br />\nto deal with larger social issues thanthe<br />\ntariff, which had principally occupied<br />\nthe three Cleveland campaigns. However, the trend of the Cleveland strica<br />\ntures is not divergent from such<br />\nconcept. His statements indicate that<br />\nhe considered the American electorate<br />\nessentially conservative, that he considered Bryan irresponsible in seeming<br />\nto offer panaceas, and that he did not<br />\nbelieve such an approach could win a<br />\nnational election.<br />\n<br />\nCleveland's Democratic Zeal<br />\nCleveland's zeal for the Democrats<br />\nto reclaim conservatism was especially<br />\npronounced as he surveyed the activism<br />\nof President Roosevelt. According to<br />\nhis notions, the Democrats could defeat<br />\nRoosevelt in 1904 if their candidate<br />\nwere suitably conservative.<br />\nThere is nothing in the writings of<br />\nCleveland to indicate any awareness of<br />\nRoosevelt's popularity. The extensive<br />\ncorrespondence serves to re-inforce<br />\nrather than to broaden Cleveland's outlook. He communicated almost exclusively with men of similar age and circumstances, men with no feeling of the<br />\nand<br />\nsocial ills enunciated by Bryan<br />\nRoosevelt.<br />\nbestFor example, Cleveland's<br />\nprobably<br />\nknown correspondent was<br />\nRichard Watson Gilder, a minor poet and<br />\nlongtime editor of the Century Magazine.<br />\nLike Grover, Gilder was something of<br />\na living legend by 1904. Cleveland also<br />\ncorresponded with his ownformer AttorState,<br />\nney General and Secretary of<br />\nRichard C. Olney. Early in 1904 Olney<br />\n<br />\nand Cleveland were gathered into something of a mutual admiration society,<br />\nwith each repeatedly urging the other to<br />\nrun for President.<br />\n<br />\nhe noted that his best service would not<br />\nbe in a speechmaking function. This is<br />\na precise statement; Grover's prowess<br />\nas an orator was always limited.<br />\n<br />\nTo Carry His Own Banner<br />\n<br />\nCleveland did appear at a businessman's function for Parker at Carnegie<br />\nHall on October 21. He then felt the<br />\nneed to give equal time to his state of<br />\nresidence, and appeared at a function<br />\nin New Jersey. These appearances were<br />\nnot strikingly successful, and Cleveland<br />\nfirmly declined to campaign inConnecticut.<br />\n<br />\nAs the above suggests, Cleveland's<br />\nfirst choice to carry his own banner<br />\ninto the 1904 campaign was not Justice<br />\nParker. The former President preferred not only Olney,who was not an aspirant<br />\nfor the nomination, but the alternate<br />\nconservative aspirant, Justice George<br />\nto<br />\nGray of Delaware. His objection<br />\nParker may be ascribed to his lack of<br />\nIn<br />\nacquaintance with the candidate.<br />\neveryone else, except<br />\ncommon with<br />\nfelt<br />\npossibly Mr. Parker, Cleveland<br />\ninsufficiently informed as to the candidate's position on major issues. It is<br />\ntherefore understandable that he preferred Olney and Gray,who had pronounOlney and Gray, who had<br />\nferred<br />\npronounced pro-Cleveland records.<br />\nHowever, Cleveland finally advised a<br />\ncorrespondent to support Parker when<br />\nthe Justice's nomination appeared inevitable. He conceded that the candidate<br />\nwas \"clean, decent, and conservative.\"<br />\nHe rose to real enthusiasm when Parker<br />\nsent his famous telegram to the Convention affirming the gold standard. Cleveland shrewdly observed that the telegram<br />\nshown Parker in a position of<br />\nhad<br />\ncommand, and that Parker should continue to display command throughout the<br />\ncampaign.<br />\n<br />\nParker Did Not<br />\nParker did not. However, Cleveland<br />\nhimself, isolated and enjoying limited<br />\nto<br />\nsources of information, continued<br />\nbelieve that the Parker vote would be<br />\nimpressive.

But Grover Cleveland, who had<br />\nbeen living as a gentleman of leisure in<br />\nsecluded Princeton, had no notable consciousness of it.<br />\nCleveland's name<br />\nstands high in the small roster of those<br />\nwho were surprised by the outcome of<br />\nthe election of 1904.<br />\n<br />\n\fPAGE 9<br />\n<br />\nNEWS\u2014LETTER<br />\n<br />\n1969<br />\n<br />\nWald Naire on American Economy<br />\nBy STEVE BLUMENTHAL<br />\nDr. Wald's Tuesday speech at Hopkins was pleasant<br />\nand witty, but it showed a striking lack of understanding<br />\nof the realistic workings of the American economy.<br />\nTo put it bluntly, he failed to consider some of the<br />\nPractical results of his vague proposals\u2014includingwidespread unemployment and runaway inflation.<br />\nSuppose, for argument's sake, we accept the Wald<br />\nSpeech at face value; the leaders of government (especially the military) and the leaders of industry have<br />\nbecome an interchangeable, self-serving, \"interlocking<br />\ndirectorate.\" These men run the business of government contracts in such a way that your tax dollar is<br />\nused to raise the profits of their respective companies,<br />\nand provide a buffer in case of a drop in the market<br />\nfor their death machines.<br />\nThis is all well and good. But suppose we grant<br />\nDoctor Wald his desires. Suppose we cut away all but the<br />\nvery basic military programs and we drastically improve<br />\nthe quality of government control over the defense<br />\nindustries.<br />\nWhat then?<br />\nAs Dr. Wald freely admitted, the government expenditures permeate our economy. He showed an understanding of why the AFL-CIO supports the ABM (jobs,<br />\n<br />\nman, jobs). What will happen to the economy if all that<br />\nchanges? It is a fact that the government's huge contracts<br />\nprovide business for the firms involved in the military<br />\nindustrial complex. Those contracts also provide work<br />\nfor the men employed by those firms, in 365 of 368<br />\ncongressional districts.<br />\nRoosevelt set about creating government programs to<br />\ngive jobs to the unemployed. One could argue that<br />\nthrough large government defense contracts, our present<br />\nadministration, and the ones that immediately preceded<br />\nit, are preventing large scale unemployment. Suppose<br />\nthose programs were eliminated. Where are you going to<br />\nemploy all those factory workers, the people hit hardest<br />\nby a rise in the unemployment?<br />\nAre you going to look to the government for jobs<br />\nthat do not involve the military? What? Why won't those<br />\nprograms show the waste and corruption that government<br />\nprograms usually show? (Remember the Job Corps?)<br />\n<br />\nOh,So Desirable!<br />\nAs to the problems of quality control over government<br />\nproduction and adherence to contract terms, this of<br />\ncourse is desirable. So are a lot of things, but the<br />\n<br />\nproblem here is that in the development of a machine for<br />\nwhich there is no prototype, a cost estimate is exactly<br />\nthat; an estimate. If something doesn't work, the revision of plans and the resetting of machines (if not the<br />\ndevelopment of entirely new and unthought of plans and<br />\nmachines) often incurs enormous amounts of unexpected<br />\nexpense.<br />\nWhat about all that money that is going to be saved<br />\nthrough the elimination of defense contracts and the<br />\nrefining of quality control? An eighty billion dollar<br />\ndefense budget will provide a rather interesting budget<br />\nsurplus. If we return it to the people (from whom it<br />\ncame in the form of taxes), the resultant inflation would<br />\nrival anthing in history. If we turn it to the problems<br />\nof the cities we run into the same old problems of lack<br />\ntof _administrative personnel and expertise. This is not<br />\nto mention the very real problem that Big Brother is<br />\nnot only watching you, but has eliminated the last<br />\nvestiges of control you have over your own life.<br />\nDr. Wald is like too many \"liberals\" and far too<br />\nmany \"new leftists\" in that he can easily point out<br />\nthe problems of an economy based on defense expenditures, while he cannot offer any alternative programs that even border on reality.<br />\n<br />\nRecords<br />\n<br />\nDamned Good, But Not Quite Perfect I<br />\nBy STUART WATTLES<br />\nArthur -The Kinks.

It has<br />\nreceived little promotion, and consequnetly, although it is one of the best<br />\nblues-soul records to be released in the<br />\npast two or three years, it has attracted<br />\nit<br />\nless attention from the public than<br />\nmerits. King and Cropper, especially,<br />\nput down some of the smoothest riffs<br />\never to go on vinyl. The influence of<br />\nBooker T. and the M.G.'s is strong<br />\nthroughout, most likely because two of<br />\nthe players are regulars in M.G.'s(Steve<br />\nCropper and Donald \"Duck\" Dunn, the<br />\nbassist.)<br />\nThree of the ten cuts feature vocals by<br />\neach of the three guitarists. The best of<br />\nthese is \"Tupelo\", a slow blues thing<br />\n<br />\n\u2022 Q.**,,<br />\n';, \u2022 '..!\u2018<br />\nct!<br />\n<br />\nin which Pop Staples sings and plays a<br />\nmournful, ghostly lead. The other seven<br />\ncuts are instrumentals. The best of these<br />\nis \"Big Bird\", a driving, loud Booker T.<br />\nsong, which must surely be a classic in<br />\nelectric blues. Two tracks, \"Trashy<br />\nDog\" and \"Knock on Wood\" (another<br />\nSteve Cropper- Booter T. piece) are<br />\nplayed by King and Cropper without<br />\nStaples.<br />\n<br />\ninstead of two and make lots of filthy<br />\nlucre. (The butchery performed on\"The<br />\nWeight\" by the Bloomfield - Kooper syndrome springs instantly to mind. Who<br />\nwants to listen to Bloomfield get wired<br />\nout on a four day speed trip and<br />\nget<br />\ncompletely lost on his fingerboard, and<br />\nthen try to fight his way out of it by fucking up a perfectly good song? I don't<br />\nunderstand it.) This record, by contrast,<br />\nis solid. Each guitarist is playing a riff<br />\nthat could easily stand by itself, but at the<br />\nsame time,they don't step on each other's<br />\nfeet, try to grab the spotlight, or play<br />\nlouder than everybody else.<br />\n<br />\nWhat is most striking about this extraordinary record is its amazingly together<br />\nsound, which it maintains almost in spite<br />\nof itself. Although it is undeniably a jam,<br />\navoids the egotism and orchestral<br />\nit<br />\nchaos which characterizes such games as<br />\nthe Kooper-Bloomfield jam sessions.<br />\nAnd, unlike Kooper and Bloomfield,they<br />\nmanage to avoid grinding out a lot of<br />\nsemi-musical bullshit to fill up four sides<br />\n<br />\nIt's a pity that this is just a jam session<br />\ninstead of a five-record contract, but I<br />\nsuppose it would be extravagant to expend<br />\nso much talent all on one group.

Three comments about<br />\nhis note seem necessary:<br />\n(1) My October 24 letter was<br />\nmeant chiefly to clarify one<br />\nstatistical point in my long letter<br />\nof October 17,where among other<br />\nthings I said, \"Even with severe<br />\ncompetition from the Ivy League<br />\nand elsewhere, about 3% of our<br />\nfreshmen are black.\"<br />\n(2) Mr. Reutter used no such<br />\nfigure. His October 10 article<br />\nimplies that there are very few<br />\nblack students at Hopkins. One<br />\nhas to read it most carefully to<br />\nbe sure that Tom Anderson is not<br />\nthe only black student on campus.<br />\n(3) By equating 3% with \"next<br />\nto nothing\" the editor conveniently ignores a main point in my<br />\nhow few<br />\nOctober 17 letter<br />\nblack male high-school seniors in<br />\nthe whole country are even minimally qualified academically for<br />\ninstitutions<br />\nas<br />\ndifficult as<br />\nHopkins.

Stanley<br />\nProfessor of Education and<br />\nPsychology, JHU<br />\n<br />\nIssues For More Exciting Personality Cult<br />\nThis year, many major issues face the freshmen, but the class' election for president could<br />\nwell turn into another popularity contest.<br />\nThe four candidates, Charlie Trueheart, David<br />\nC harry, Allen F. Ross, and Steve Jones, have all<br />\nelucidated strikingly similar opinions in their<br />\nbids for the freshman vote on November 4.<br />\nWhen questioned on the issues of dormitory<br />\nregulations, freshman social life, coeducation,<br />\npass-fail, and the student role in the decisionmaking processes of the University, the four<br />\ncandidates differed only slightly, with that disagreement being in the particular details of the<br />\nissues.<br />\n<br />\n\"Equal Say\"<br />\nWhen asked about the role of the student in<br />\nmaking decisions in those areas which affect<br />\nhim, Charlie Trueheart said that \"the student<br />\nbody should have the power to develop its own<br />\ncurriculum.\" Trueheart also stated that students<br />\nshould have the right to decide dorn regulations.<br />\nAllen Ross, president of Gildersleeve house,said,<br />\n\"There should be an equal say in the senate<br />\non issues which concern faculty, and students.<br />\nA 60 year old Nobel prize winner or an 18 year<br />\nold Freshman; it is still one man, one vote.\"<br />\nRoss added, \"the students should decide for<br />\nthemselves what regulations, if any, should exist.\"<br />\nBoth David Charry, and Steve Jones are in favor<br />\nof an \"equal voice with the faculty\" with Jones<br />\nconsidering the administration as well. All the<br />\ncandidates placed limitations as to feasibility,<br />\non the scope of student power.<br />\nBoth Allen Ross and David Charry came out<br />\nexplicitly in favor of the proposed University<br />\nSenate.<br />\n<br />\nStudent Union<br />\n<br />\nThe one difference in the role which the<br />\nstudent should play in the University was vocalized<br />\nby David Charry. He advocated the formation of<br />\na student Union to get bargaining powers with<br />\nthe University. Charry said, \"There are professors who hide and don't teach classes. The<br />\nstudents have a right to benefit from them.\"<br />\n<br />\nCharry also felt the University should \"live up<br />\nto its promises in the catalogue\".<br />\nThe issue of mandatory physical education<br />\nis again one on which all the candidates agree.<br />\nTrueheart said,\" For the same reasons class<br />\nattendance is not required, gym should not be<br />\nrequired.\" Ross stated that \"there are intercollegiate and intramural sports for those who<br />\nwant to play, and groups could be organized to<br />\nteach those who want to learn new sports.\"<br />\nCharry said, \"all the administration has to do<br />\nis substitute a voluntary, structured program in<br />\nathletics\". Jones also went on record against<br />\np<br />\nmaasnt.datory gym, but offered that the gym should<br />\nbe on<br />\nopen for general use more than it has in the<br />\nEach candidate echoed what the others said<br />\non the coeducation issue. Trueheart said, \"It<br />\n(coeducation) will make the atmosphere a lot<br />\npleasanter.\" Ross noted, \"coeducation is a good<br />\nthing as long as the University won't have to<br />\nexpand to the point where it is no longer a small<br />\nUniversity.\" In all of Ross's statements, there<br />\nseemed to be a note of thoughtful caution.<br />\nSteve Jones stated that the greatest benefit<br />\nof coeducation from an academic standpoint is<br />\nthat it \"would strengthen<br />\ne7 the liberal arts.\"<br />\n<br />\nIt appears that the only real difference lies<br />\nin the personalities of the candidates. David<br />\nCharry is more for confronting the administration, if necessary, through sit-ins. Charry<br />\nis being supported by a group of students who<br />\nhave met several times previously, and voted<br />\nto support him for the presidency.<br />\nTrueheart stated that he is running in opposition to this group which he claims is trying to<br />\nbull its way into control of the freshman class.<br />\nThe group of freshmen is supporting candidates<br />\nfor each of the other offices. Trueheart said<br />\nthat he does not like the idea of a slate of<br />\ncandidates.<br />\nNeither Ross, nor Jones have made any mention<br />\nof what type of tactics they would use.<br />\n<br />\nJOHNS HOPKINS PRESENTS<br />\nFriday, October 31st<br />\n8:30 P.M.

His five touchdown and two-point conversion give him a 32 point total. PaulWeiss's four touchdowns place<br />\nhim second with 24 points. Fullback Steve Hata has three scores for<br />\n18 points.

Harry Thies scored the first Baby Jays' touchdown<br />\nin the first quarter. Jim Pitts hit Jim Ferguson with the two-point<br />\nconversion. Pitts also scored one t-d and Tim Weglicki caught a<br />\nPitts' pass for the other Hopkins tally. Today, the freshman travel<br />\nup York Road to take on Towson State at 3:00 p.m.<br />\n<br />\nCross Country<br />\nBoth the varsity and freshman cross country teams are home<br />\ntomorrow. Their foes are the freshman and varsity harriers from<br />\nTowson State. The meet is scheduled to start at 2:00 p.m.<br />\n<br />\nLuckless Carnegie Mellon<br />\nJohns Hopkins' opponent next Saturday will be<br />\nCarnegie Mellon, a good but unlucky team.<br />\nCarnegie won its first game last week over<br />\nFranklin and Marshall after four consecutive<br />\nloses. The Hopkins coaching staff realizes that<br />\nCarnegie Mellon should not be taken lightly by<br />\nour team, if it wishes to win.<br />\nThe Tartans have a potent passing attack, and<br />\na solid running game. They have averaged 23.5<br />\npoints per game on offense. Sophomore Richie<br />\nSquires is a fine quarterback who has completed<br />\n12 touchdown passes this year. Split end Charley<br />\nPrice is a freshmen sensation who has caught<br />\nfour passes to Td's this year. The tight end is<br />\nTony Bugel, a co-captain of the team, who is<br />\nanother reliable receiver.<br />\nThe backfield is comprised of halfbacks Terry<br />\nBell, Tom Lombardo, and fullback, Rudy Tepsic.<br />\nBell, the workhorse of the group, has gained over<br />\n400 yards rushing their year and has caught 19<br />\npasses, two going for touchdown. Lombardo had his<br />\nbest game of the year against F.and M. He ran for<br />\n144 yards on only 23 carries.<br />\n<br />\nDefense Vulnerable<br />\nDefensively, the Tartans are vulnerable on<br />\nboth the ground and through the air. Carnegie<br />\nhad allowed its opponents 42.8 points a game before defeating Franklin and Marshall, 34 to 13.<br />\nHowever, the Diplomats were without the services<br />\nof its number one quarterback, Sam Long, and<br />\nits best runner, John Brunetti, who played so well<br />\nin F. and M.'s close loss to Hopkins earlier in<br />\nthe year.<br />\nHead Coach Joe Gasparella of Carnegie has<br />\nbeen attempting to patch up the defensive weaknesses of the club, and may have finally succeeded.<br />\nIf Hopkins is able to contain the offensive<br />\npower of Carnegie, a victory would most certainly<br />\nbe assurred. However, the Blue Jays themselves,<br />\nhave shown glaring defensive weaknesses in its<br />\ntwo losses this year, especially in last weeks<br />\ncontest with Hampton Sydney.<br />\n<br />\nBIA<br />\n<br />\noff balance as he tries to run around end. Weiss<br />\npresently is the second leading scorer on the<br />\nVarsity.<br />\nCarnegie has a tendency to fumble, and throw<br />\ninterceptions, furthering pressure on the defensive unit. This is also a concern of Coach<br />\nGasparella and must be exploited by the Blue<br />\nJays.<br />\nThe game against Hampton Sydney was one<br />\nthe Blue Jays would like to forget. Carnegie's<br />\n1 and 4 record is not a true indication of their<br />\npotential on the field. And coming off a win over<br />\nF. and M. will have added spirit to the Tartan's<br />\ngame. Hopkins though must win, if it is to have<br />\na respectible record.<br />\n<br />\nNOTES<br />\n<br />\nThe BIA freshman football season came to<br />\na close this week, as undoubtedly the toughest<br />\ngame was played. Clark, undefeated and untied,<br />\nmet Gildersleeve, with a 5-1 record, for the<br />\nDivision I title. Clark, known for its size and<br />\npower, could manage only a 6-6 tie in a wellplayed game that went into overtime. Don Krohn,<br />\nthe Clark quarterback, ran for his team's only<br />\nscore. A tight Gildersleeve defense prevented<br />\nthe extra points. Quarterback Bob Wilson,finding<br />\nhis receivers well covered, decided to keep the<br />\nball and also ran for a touchdown, accounting<br />\nfor Gildersleeve's only score.<br />\nAlthough spoiling its perfect record, Gildersleeve could not overtake Clark in the standings<br />\nand finished a game and a half behind first.<br />\nIn another overtime game, Adams and Baker<br />\nplayed to a scoreless tie. Neither team could<br />\nkeep control of the football and the game was<br />\nplagued with numerous interceptions.<br />\nIn Division II, Lazear was shut out twice by<br />\nSylvester and Royce. Sylvester put together their<br />\nwhole offense and came up with one touchdown<br />\nand the extra point. Its defense supplied the<br />\nremaining points with a safety.<br />\npassing of Mike<br />\nRoyce, on the brilliant<br />\nKestigian, also downed Lazear, 18-0.

Weiss ventured out from _the goal<br />\nto defend one-on-one against the advancing McKee. The shot was<br />\nPartially blocked by Weiss, but it eventually dribbled into the net.<br />\nThe game was a blow to Hopkins in more than just a loss as<br />\nseveral players incurred injuries.<br />\nHopkins coach Bob Knauff commented, \"We forgot our fundamentals and didn't play well as a team. Every time we don't work<br />\ntogether we will lose.<br />\n\"We had too many lapses on both offense and defense. I think<br />\nGettysbur deserves to win; they outplayed us.\"<br />\n<br />\nF&M<br />\nKnauff's varsity soccer team received another jolt to hopes of<br />\nthe MAC crown and perhaps a national ranking as they played to<br />\na scoreless tie against Franklin and Marshall.<br />\nThe outlook for the second half of season is bleak what with the<br />\nentire front line injured in some capacity. Scott Tyner is favoring a<br />\nsevere charlie horse, Bob Szeles has a pulled groin muscle. Bernie<br />\nWenker has a bad ankle, and Ron Rowes had chip bone in knee which<br />\nhad to be operated on. Also, halfback and co-captain Dave Roberts<br />\nhas a sprained ankle.

Knowles, the man ousted<br />\nfrom an appointment as a HEW assistant<br />\nsecretary<br />\nby the American Medical<br />\nAssociation, spoke to the<br />\nHopkins<br />\nmedical community Tuesday while<br />\nhis<br />\nsuccessor, AMA-approved Dr. Roger<br />\nEgebert, endorsed in Washington a plan<br />\ncondemned by Knowles.<br />\n\"Health insurance has perpetuated a<br />\nfreeze on tivality insurance in this country,\" Knowles<br />\nstated at a<br />\npress<br />\nconference<br />\nbefore his well-attended<br />\nspeech in Turner Auditorium.<br />\nMeanwhile, at another press conference,<br />\nDr.<br />\nEgeberg, assistant<br />\nsecretary for health and scientific affairs<br />\nin HEW, approved implementation of<br />\n\"universal compulsary national health<br />\ninsurance\" by the Federal government in<br />\nfour to five years.<br />\nKnowles, the Director of the Massachusetts General Hospital, was rejected<br />\nin June from the HEW post by President<br />\nNixon after<br />\nthe American<br />\nMedical<br />\nAssociation<br />\nexpressed strong<br />\ndisapproval of the appointment.<br />\nOn Tuesday, Knowles criticized<br />\nthe government's present health program, advocated<br />\nincreased medical<br />\nsupport from the private sector, condemned the country's mental health<br />\nsystem, documented the \"skyrocketing\"<br />\ncost of hospital care and refused to advocate the legalization of marijuana.<br />\n<br />\n\"Medicaid insurance does not insure<br />\nthe consumer,\" Knowles declared. He<br />\nstated that the government's entire health<br />\ninsurance plans \"give far too much attention to producers of health services and<br />\ntoo<br />\nlittle to consumers of health<br />\nservices.\" Calling it a \"lousy system\"<br />\nhe noted that \"medicaid has poured in<br />\n$5 billion in health service without any<br />\nimprovement in service.\"<br />\nAnother difficulty with the federal<br />\nprograms, Knowles maintained, has been<br />\nthe centralized bureaucracy that is choking hospital services.The Director of Vie<br />\nMassachusetts Hospital and Harvard<br />\nM'edical professor advocated a return to<br />\nprivate sector financing with government<br />\ncontrols as a way out of the present<br />\nhosptial \"crisis period.\"<br />\n\"Even with its failings, the private<br />\nthe<br />\nsector has done a better job than<br />\npublic secotr,\" Knowles claimed.

Presently<br />\n$1.6 billion is allocated for<br />\nresearch and medical programs by<br />\nWashington, and this is now being trimmed. \"This is being<br />\npenny-wise and<br />\ndollar-foolish,\"<br />\nKnowles remarked,<br />\n\"Right now only 9,000 physicians are<br />\n<br />\nDr. John H.

Over half of all hospital patients in<br />\nthe United States are there for mental<br />\ndiseases and they have been traditionally<br />\nneglected, Knowles said. To improve the<br />\nsituation, Knowles suggested ending the<br />\nsegregation of mental patients from the<br />\nrest of the population and better staff<br />\ntraining to cope with mental sickness.<br />\nThe tremedous increase in hospital<br />\ncosts that has outstripped most other<br />\nconsumer services were attributed to<br />\nthree major causes by Dr. Knowles.<br />\nInflationary pressure on hospital costs,<br />\nlarge increases of staff wages in recent<br />\nyears to make up for the previous low<br />\nwages and high costs for sophisticated<br />\nnew medical equipment were listed by<br />\nKnowles as the major high rise culprits.<br />\nHe warned, though, against cutbacks<br />\nin hospital budgets to try to get health<br />\ncare more efficient. \"Private industry<br />\ncan cut costs, but quality care will<br />\nsuffer,\" he remarked.<br />\nIn a final question, Knowles refused<br />\nto endorse the legalization of marijuana.<br />\n\"Why should you encourage people to<br />\nsmoke anything,\" he asked rattling off<br />\nthe diseases, including cancer<br />\nand<br />\nbronchitis, that it can cause.<br />\n<br />\nTHE NEWS IN BRIEF<br />\nMeade,'Mary Jane'<br />\n'Gagged, Chained'<br />\nMargaret Meade, the well-known anthropologist, told<br />\nsenators on Monday that marijuana should not only be<br />\nlegalized, but should also be available for use at age 16.<br />\n\"There should be no more restrictions on smoking<br />\nmarijuana than on smoking cigarettes or drinking beer,<br />\n\"Dr. Meade told a Senate subcommittee.She later claimed<br />\nthat there is no evidence that marijuana is harmful in<br />\nitself or leads to the use of more dangerous substances.<br />\nStated the Columbia University professor, \"It (marijuana) doesn't lead to the excesses of behavior that alcohol<br />\ndoes and it does not have the toxic effects tobacco has.\"<br />\nDr. Mead said that she has tried marijuana once. \"I<br />\ndon't find it something I need,\" she stated, but added, \"if<br />\nI were young today, I'm sure I would be using marijuana.\"<br />\nIn her Senate testimony, Dr. Meade criticized the hypocritical parents who, she said, \"tell their children not<br />\nto smoke pot while they are holding a cocktail in one hand<br />\nand a cigarette in the other.\"<br />\n<br />\nThe 'Farce'.<br />\nThe Black Student Union at the University of Maryland<br />\nhas issued a strong policy statement condemning the<br />\nschool's newly instituted black studies program as a<br />\n\"farce.\"<br />\nThe Union demanded black student leaders be given a<br />\nkey role in organizing another program that would offer<br />\na degree in black studies.

Staats<br />\nin opposition to the Labor Department's minority hiring<br />\nplan for Philidelphia construction workers.<br />\nThe plan, however, was defended by Labor Secretary<br />\nGeorge P.

Seale<br />\nforced an early recess Tuesday in the conspiracy trial<br />\nof the \"Chicago Eight.\"<br />\nJudge Julius J. Hoffman dismissed the jury more than<br />\nhalf an hour before the usual time after Mr. Seale, chairman of the Black Panther party, continued to shout accusations and questions at the judges and government<br />\nwitnesses. Judge Hoffman warned Mr. Seale that he had<br />\nthe power to \"have you gagged and chained to your chair.\"<br />\nThe seven other defendants then joined Seale in a<br />\nchallenge to the court's authority. Despite repeated orders<br />\nfrom the judge, all eight refused to stand when he recessed the court. It was the most tumultuous scene yet in the<br />\nfive -week-old trial of the eight men charged with conspiracy to incite a riot during last year's Democratic Convention.<br />\nIf Seale continues to escalate his outbursts as he has<br />\nover the past two weeks, and if Judge Hoffman follows<br />\nthrough on his threat to gag and shackle him, legal observers say the defense would almost certainly use it as<br />\nthe basis for a motion for a mistrial or an appeal. The<br />\nexchange began when Bobby Seale demanded to crossexamine a Chicago undercover policeman.<br />\n<br />\nBishops OK Lay<br />\nThe Roman Catholic Synod of Bishops concluded its<br />\n1969 sessionthisweek in a spirit of almost universal<br />\nsatisfaction among the participants.<br />\nThe tabulation of voting during their meetings showed<br />\nonly one issue on which delegates failed to demonstrate<br />\nnear unanimity. This was the question of whether lay and<br />\npriest experts should be permitted to assist the bishop<br />\ndelegates at future synod sessions.<br />\nExperts had a powerful impact on the shape of the<br />\ndecisions made at the Second Vatican Council, but were<br />\nexcluded from this synod and the one in 1967. Of the 143<br />\nbishops voting, 97 balloted in favor of admitting the experts in the future, 25 opposed the idea, 18 favored it with<br />\nqualifications and 3 abstained.<br />\nTwo other questions, which were the most complex<br />\nissues on which the synod sought to find a common mind,<br />\nattracted a large number of qualified yes votes.

CRAMER<br /><br />\nThe Academic Council has recommended to<br />\nPresident Gordon that Hopkins admit women<br />\nundergraduates for the Fall term of next year.<br />\nThe Council's recommendations, passed in<br />\nits Wednesday meeting, call for GOrdon to<br />\nappoint a \"task force committee\" to report<br />\nto the Academic Council with full details on<br />\nthe institution of general undergraduate coeducation.<br />\nUntil this task force completes its work ,it<br />\nwill not be known how many women will be<br />\nadmitted and in which classes, or if the total<br />\nsize of the undergraduate body will be changed.<br />\n\"Some Women\"<br />\nThe Council, however, did specify that<br />\nit wanted \"some women\" to be admitted for<br />\nenrollment next year. The statement released<br />\nby Dean Kimball's office yesterday said that<br />\nit was the Council's intent that Hopkins \"proceed as rapidly as feasible to a significant proportion of females in the undergraduate body.\"<br />\nCouncil members were generally unwilling to<br />\ntalk about the decision yesterday. The members<br />\nof the task force have not been named by<br />\nthe President. The recommendations of the<br />\nAcademic Council must be approved by Gordon<br />\nand the Board of Trustees before they may be<br />\nacted upon. Although Gordon was unavailable<br />\nfor comment yesterday, it is assumed that he<br />\nwill react favorably to the recommendations.<br />\nThe next meeting of the Board of Trustees will<br />\ntake place on November 10.<br />\nThe task force will consist of two members<br />\nof the faculty, two undergraduates, one rep-<br /><br />\nresentative from Dean Kimball's office, and one<br />\nrepresentative from the Office of Robert F.<br />\nKerley, the Vice-President for Administration.<br />\n\"Soon,\"Very Soon<br /><br />\nDirector of Admissions William Brinldey said that<br />\nthat he would meet the committee's recommendations \"soon\" in' order to do an effective job of recruiting for the Fall term. \"I'm<br />\nnot ready to move until I get the answers,\"<br />\nhe said. Another administrative source said<br />\nthat the report of the task force would probably<br />\nhave to be submitted by November 15 for<br />\ncoeducation to be successfully implemented<br />\nnext year.<br />\nBrinkley was enthusiastic about the possibilities which coeducation would provide for<br />\nHopkins. He said he wanted to see it become<br />\npart of \"our total program.\" He also stated<br />\nthat it might benefit the recruiting efforts of<br />\nthe ,University by making Hopkins more attractive to men. Ronald 0 wens, Assistant Director<br />\nof Admissions, said that the coeducation move<br />\nwould indicate a general improvement in the<br />\nsocial conditions at Hopkins.<br />\nAlready Interviewing<br />\nBrinkley stated that the University was already receiving letters from women. His staff<br />\nhas already been talking to female high school<br />\nseniors. However, he stated, that he also wished<br />\nto enroll transfer students. \"I think we could<br />\nget some fine young ladies through transfer,\"<br />\nhe said. No one was willing to speculate on<br />\nhow many women would be enrolled in each<br />\nclass. Presumably, the women will enroll in<br /><br />\nthe Freshmen class more than any other.<br />\nAccording to Homewood House sources,President Gordon views the task force as responsible<br />\nfor reporting on every aspect of the changes<br />\nrequired for coeducation. This indicates that<br />\nthe committee will look into everything from<br />\n\u2022alterations in the curriculum to placing<br />\n\"men\" and \"women\" signs on the doors of<br />\nlavatories.<br />\nAdministrators have been looking into the<br />\nproblems and possibilities of undergraduate coeducation for some time. Recently, the<br />\nAcademic Council affirmed undergraduate coeducation \"in principle.\"<br /><br />\nNo Merger<br />\nThere had been discussion of the feasibility<br />\nof merging with Goucher College instead of<br />\nadmitting women to Hopkins. It was felt by<br />\nsome that because Goucher already had all of<br />\nthe facilities which women require, Hopkins<br />\nwould be wiser to attempt the merger.<br />\nThe faculty at Hopkins, however, was largely<br />\nagainst the move. There was a fear that faculty<br />\nmembers here would lose the control which<br />\nthey exercise over curriculum and program requirements if the university merged with<br />\nGoucher. Many faculty members were upset<br />\nover the types of courses offered in the<br />\nGoucher-Hopkins cooperative\u2022program.<br />\nIn addition, problems of transportation between the two campuses would have proved<br />\ndifficult to eliminate. Had Hopkins and Goucher<br />\nmerged, the university would have accrued no<br />\nfinancial advantages. Goucher's endowment is<br />\nsmall compared to that of Hopkins.<br /><br />\nNews-Letter<br />\nVol. LXXIV<br /><br />\nHOMEWOOD, BALTIMORE<br /><br />\nOCTOBER 31, 1969<br /><br />\n74th YEAR<br /><br />\nWald Scores Military As Symposium Opens<br />\nBy ARTHUR LEVINE<br />\nDr. George Wald, Nobel laureate<br />\nin Medicine and Physiology, sharply attacked American militarism<br />\nat the keynote address of the 1968<br />\nMilton S.

If one<br />\ntries to understand it in terms of<br /><br />\nDr. George Wald of Harvard advised his audience Tuesday, that the only way<br />\nto intelligently view the process of military appropriation is as a business.<br /><br />\ndefense, strategy, or ;chnology,<br />\nor technology, one will end up in<br />\nhopeless confusion. It ipatnotism,1<br />\none approaches it as a business<br />\nthat it all becomes reasonably<br />\nclear,\" he remarked.<br />\nDr. Wald pointed to the deployment of the ABM as an example of<br />\nthe \"Business of Death.\" He noted<br /><br />\nthe futile opposition of physicists,<br />\ncomputer specialists, former Presidential science advisers, and<br />\nother experts to the deployment<br />\nof the Safeguard system. He charged that many of the scientists who<br />\ndid support the ABM were connected with institutions like the<br />\nHudson Institute that received De-<br /><br />\nfense Department funds.<br />\nClaiming that the ABM was both<br />\nunworkable and useless, Wald said,<br />\n\"It wasn't science, it wasn't military, so what was it?\" He paused,<br />\nand stated, \"12 billion dollars in<br />\ndefense contracts.\" Wald observed<br />\nthat the estimated cost of the<br />\nABM has risen in the last year<br />\nyear from 5.5 billion dollars to 12<br />\nbillion dollars, and, he commented,<br />\n\"The end is not in sight.\"<br />\nMIRV Worse<br />\nThe Harvard Professor of Biology<br />\ncontinued by declaring that the<br />\nMIRV (Multiple Independently<br />\nTargetable Re-entry Vehicles) is far<br />\nmore dangerous than ABM. He<br />\njokingly commented on the name<br />\nof the multiple warheads by saying, \"You all know about vehicles.<br />\nWhy, except for a few independently targetable Warheads, this is<br />\njust like a Chevy.\"<br />\nOur present stockpile of single<br />\nwarhead weapons is too large now,<br />\nhe said, and the use of MIRV<br />\nwould even be more foolish. \"Re(Continued on page 4)<br /><br />\nOct. 31, 1969<br /><br />\nNEWS\u2014LETTER<br /><br />\nPAGE 2<br /><br />\n'Start At Home;Says Sargent Shriver<br />\nBy PETER KATES<br />\nStaff Member.<br />\n\"A new union of men is necessary in<br />\nthis country.

Mr. Raskin said, \"Our<br />\nbudget tells us something about who we<br />\nare as a country. We are doing things that<br />\nshouldn't be done in the first place. Our<br />\neconomic system should be related to<br />\nhuman needs.\" He asserted that the<br />\nCuban missile crisis of 1963 illustrates<br />\nthe dangerous influence of the military.<br />\nHe stated, \"We were, in effect, hostages<br />\nof the few men who made the decision.<br />\nThe contract conception of government<br />\nwas abandoned.\"<br /><br />\nCongressman Otis Pike (D-NY)of the<br />\nHouse Armed Services Committee,a liberal critic of the military, asserted that<br />\nthe military-industrial complex should<br />\nbe controlled but not abolished. He<br />\ndecried Defense secrecy and wasteful<br />\nexpenditures.

He remarked,<br />\nBut don't let that get you down. Simultaneously we can kill 140 million<br />\nRussians. And that's with a single warhead.\"<br />\nHe added, \"The present plan is to tool<br />\nthem up to MIRV's. Whenthat'sfinished,<br />\nwe will have multiplied our present<br />\nstockpile by five.

He noted that one out of every<br />\nten American workers is working on<br />\nsome sort of defense contract. \"That's<br />\nwhy the AFL-CIO is so interested in<br />\nkeeping up the level of our armaments,\"<br />\nhe said, \"and indeed they approve of the<br />\nVietnam war.\" He stated that even the<br />\nmost innocent scientific experimentation<br />\nwas always under Defense scrutiny because of the possibility that it might be<br /><br />\nexploited for use in war. He charged<br />\nthat this influence of the military<br />\nwas<br />\nseriously<br />\nundermining the American<br />\nsystem of checks and balances. \"We<br />\nare,\" he said, \"faced with an interlocking directorate that involves all components of American life and all aspects of<br />\nthe government.\"<br />\nThe 139 members of both Houses who<br />\nhave reserve commissions and the close<br />\nties between the Pentagon and the defense<br />\nindustries were pointed to as examples<br />\nof this \"interlocking directorate\".

He pointed to<br />\nWillis<br />\nHawkins, who went from Vice President<br />\nof Lockheed to Under Secretary of Research and Development in the Defense<br />\nDepartment and then back again<br />\nto<br />\nLockheed. Dr. Wald noted that Lockheed<br />\nhas been showered with lucrative contracts, especially the controversial C-5A<br />\ntransport plane. He observed that a cost<br />\noverrun of $2.2 billion dollars was<br />\ndeliberately covered-up by the Pentagon<br />\naccountants so as not to hurt Lockheed on<br />\nthe stock market.

The<br />\nupcoming Strategic Arms Limitation<br />\nTalks are only dealing with controlled<br />\nescalation. When we can multiply warheads we will no longer be able to make<br />\naerial inspections, as we do know, and<br />\nthat means the end of arms limitations.\"<br />\nDr. Wald said the building of weapons<br />\nsystems instead of consumer goods was<br />\nresulting in a negative balance of trade.<br />\nHe added that industries should orient<br />\nthemselves to activities that will fill<br />\nhe<br />\nimportant human needs. \"Or,\"<br />\nwarned, \"we'll end up eating those<br />\nMIRV's.\"<br /><br />\nWho's Moral?<br />\nThe only overt opposition to Wald or<br />\nto the views expressed in his address<br />\nafter the question and answer<br />\ncame<br />\nperiod, when a group of ten students<br />\ngathered around the lecturer on stage.<br />\nRichard Wilson, a graduate student in<br />\nInternational Relations threaded his way<br />\nthrough the group to confront Wald with<br />\nwhat he termed the speech's \"frivolity.\"<br />\nWilson angrily accused Wald of telling<br />\njokes instead of dealing with substantive<br />\nissues, attributing the lack to insufficient<br />\nmoral concern. Wilson stated that Wald<br />\nhad brought none of his expertise to bear<br />\non the matters discussed. Wald, at first,<br />\ncalmly attempted to explain that his field<br />\nof expertise was the biochemical aspects<br />\nof vision and had nothing to dowith arms<br />\ncontrol or defense policy.<br />\nWhen Wilson persisted in berating the<br />\nlecturer, Wald became annoyed and stated that the could have spoken on biochemistry \"and demonstrated all the expertise you goddamn well would want.\"<br />\nHe added,\"But I sure as hell would rather<br />\ntalk about this!\"<br />\nWald cited a conversation he had with<br />\na government representative who asked<br />\nhim to contribute to a project developing<br />\ntemporary blinding agents. Wald stated<br />\nthat he would not participate in such a<br />\nproject and felt \"morally superior\" to<br />\nthe government employee. \"I'm moral<br />\nas hell,\" he told Wilson. \"And you've<br />\nchosen to pick on the wrong guy!\"<br /><br />\npanel for the audience was the excited<br />\nexchange of comments between Representative Pike and Marcus Raskin.<br />\nRaskin urged almost complete dismantling of the present military system.\"<br />\nWe do not need an ABM missile system,<br />\nwe do not need 149,900 nuclear weapons,\"<br />\nRaskin asserted, as Pike kept asking,<br />\n\"What do we need?\" Raskin responded,<br />\n\"We do not need the power to destroythe<br />\nworld. I'm saying we can reduce the<br />\nmilitary by 98% and negotiate the rest.\"<br />\nPike, however, said, \"I happen to think<br />\nwe need a military establishment.\"<br />\nMarcus responded, \"My argument is<br />\nthat the military establishment,including<br />\nthe corporations, unions, and universities, has virtually inverted the value<br />\nsystem of those who are not involved in<br />\ndecision-making.\"<br />\nIn response to a question on whether<br />\ndefense work was profitable, L. Berkley<br />\nDavis said, \"The return on investment<br />\nfor military sales is only about 6%,while<br />\nfor commercial sales it's around 14%.<br />\nDefense work is not as profitable as<br />\neveryone thinks it is. And it's only 3%of<br />\nthe Gross National Product.\"<br /><br />\nDecisions, Decisions<br />\nRaskin then commented on decisionmaking, and made a proposal to submit<br />\nthe budget to a vote. \"The people who<br />\noperate at the beginning of the decisionmaking system really decide the frame of<br />\nreference the rest of us have to operate<br />\nwithin. The Congressman votes within the<br />\ncontext that you, Mr. Davis, are laying<br />\ndown.

However, he did maintain as a major factor his \"total frustration about getting<br />\nthings done in the Student Council.\"<br />\nDean Rudoy, also a junior class representative, had resigned a month earlier. He said that personal reasons were<br />\nresponsible for his resignation. At the<br />\ntime, a member of the junior class<br />\nWho was asked to fill the vacancy criticized the Council, and refused to take<br />\nthe position.<br />\nBetcher plans to spend his time now on<br />\nthe Student Association. He indicated<br />\nthat he felt that this would be a more useful way for him to spend his time. He<br />\nsaid that the Student Council was \"too<br />\nmuch of a hassle\" with too little reward.<br />\nHe also indicated his intentions -of<br />\ncontinuing to work for a University Senate, though in a capacity outside of the<br />\nCouncil. \"The extinction of the Student<br />\nCouncil is what I look forward to,\"<br />\nBetcher maintained. \"The entire Student<br />\nCouncil is absurd in its structure.\"<br />\nBetcher insists that the University<br />\nSenate is the answer to the problem,<br />\nin that it is not isolated from the students, the faculty, or the administration,<br />\nas are most of the present governance<br />\nstructures.<br />\nAt the Monday night meeting of the<br /><br />\nStudent Council, Betcher had intended to<br />\nread a prepared statement on his reasons<br />\nfor resigning. Instead, he simply stated<br />\nthat the \"rumors you have all heard about<br />\nme resigning from the SC are true. I<br />\nresign. I guess that's about it.\" He then<br />\nclosed his notebook and walked out of the<br />\nmeeting.<br />\nIssueless Elections<br />\nIn the letter which he had intended to<br />\nread, he wrote that \"the structure by<br />\nwhich the university is governed is inimical to the interests of students, and to<br />\nthe interests of the university community as a whole. This structure insures not<br />\nonly that students will be unfairly represented, but that the three segments of<br />\nthe university will be effectively isolated from each other's opinions.\"<br />\nThe letter continued, \"Student Council representatives elected by a handful<br />\nof students, in issueless elections, and<br />\nstudent representatives whose actions<br />\nand opinions are rarely heard of outside<br />\nthe meetings clearly do not provide for<br />\neffective representation of individual<br />\nstudents or of the student body's wishes<br />\nin the university community.\" Betcher<br />\nended his proposed letter of resignation<br />\nwith the hope that \"my resignation will<br />\nbe construed not as a criticism of the<br />\nCouncil, but rather as a positive affirmation of the ultimate necessity of a university-wide senate.\"<br /><br />\nenough known that he would seriously be<br />\nconsidered without having had an interview.<br />\n\"We Were Wrong\"<br />\nRoss was not selected for either committee. He later learned that only three<br />\nnames were presented for consideration<br />\nand that his was not among them, nor<br />\neven mentioned. Ross felt, as he stated<br />\nat the SC meeting Monday night, that he<br />\nhad been misled and that he had been<br />\n\"wronged by the Council.\" Chuck Fax<br />\nadmitted, \"We were wrong. We all know<br />\nthe thing was done lousy.\"<br />\nThe Council voted to table the motion<br />\nto reconsider the appointments to the<br />\nCurriculum Committee.

John<br />\nGuess, Student Council President, announced that the SC would have a<br />\nweekly thirty-minute show on WJHU.<br /><br />\nAnother committee member, Peter<br />\nTell, stressed that there is no factionalism within Hopkins. \"It's not certain,<br />\nbut we will probably follow the same general platform as the group,\" he said.<br />\n\"We cannot, escape the fact that Baltimore is fifty per cent black, and in order<br />\nto gain the popular support of these people<br />\nit's necessary to come out in favor of<br />\nprograms for them. The idea of a<br />\nmoratorium, as Sam Brown (head of the<br />\nNational Vietnam Moratorium Corn-<br /><br />\nmittee) put it, is to get all the support<br />\nthat is possible.<br />\n\"If, in order to accomplish this goal,<br />\nof<br />\nwe must recognize the grievances<br />\nsuch groups as the Black Panthers, then<br />\nI am all for this.

For the first time in several years, issues are being discussed which<br />\nwill significantly affect the quality of life for the members of the freshman<br />\nclass. The issues of gym requirements, dormitory regulations, and the<br />\nlarger questions about the role of the students in the university are all<br />\nimportant.<br />\nThe election has an even larger significance as it will do much to<br />\ndetermine the character of the Hopkins campus. For all intents and purposes, the campus is the bailiwick of the dormitory residents and the<br />\nfreshmen comprise a majority of these students. The tone set by the new<br />\nleadership of the freshman class will make itself felt in the dormitory<br />\ncomplex and on the campus as a whole. In this way, the upcoming elections will affect all of Homewood as well as the class which does the voting.<br />\nAmong the four candidates for the Presidency of the class, there is<br />\nlittle difference as to the views on the issues of the campaign. However,<br />\nthere are great differences regarding the manner in which the candidates<br />\nPropose to go about achieving their goals. Two of the candidates have not<br />\nspecified how they would approach the problems and questions which<br />\nconfront their class. Steve Jones and Allen Ross are only too willing to<br />\ndeal in abstract policies and their attitudes on various issues. However,<br />\nthey have little to say with regard to the concrete efforts they will make to<br />\nachieve their goals. David Charry differs in that he has evolved a set of<br />\ntactics which he would use to effect the changes he favors.<br />\nHowever, the tactics which Charry has developed are insufficient and<br />\nill-reasoned. He suggests that if Dean Kimball does not respond to the<br />\nrequests of the freshmen that the gym requirement be abolished, the<br />\nfreshmen don their gym shorts and iilant themselves in Kimball's office<br />\nuntil something is done. In another instance, Chaffy suggested that students threaten to visit their old high schools and dissuade potential applicants from coming to Hopkins. These tactics are cute, but experience<br />\nhas shown that they achieve little at Hopkins. Charry has not made an<br />\neffective study of the way decisions are reached at Homewood, and most<br />\nof the tactics which he outlines are of the \"last-ditch effort\" variety.<br />\nAdministrators rarely allow anything to get to the last ditch. The most<br />\neffective work is done before tactics of confrontation are called for.<br />\nOnly one candidate seems to us to have carefully observed the decision-making process at Homewood. Charlie Trueheart is like Charry in<br />\nthat he does not confine himself to abstractions about what the freshmen<br /><br />\nctv cir moor<br />\nsERT:ZS lq6c1<br /><br />\nA 12AWE TO\\<br /><br />\nThe first week of the Milton S.

The success of this year's program is directly attributable to<br />\nthe efforts of four juniors, who conceived, organized and prdmoted this<br />\nyear's Symposium.<br />\nSteve Mahinka, Bill Betcher, Roger Faxon and Dean Rudoy worked<br />\nthrough the summer and the start of the present school year to bring the<br />\nimpressive list of speakers and participants to Hopkins.<br />\nThe Symposium stands as a model for university programs which<br />\nbenefit the entire community. It was rewarding to see that the large<br />\naudiences at Dr. Wald's address, the panel discussion on the MilitaryIndustrial Complex and \"The War Games\" were composed of diverse<br />\ntypes of people. Students were joined by faculty members, university<br />\nemployees and area residents in attending the programs.<br />\nWe would like to see more programs of the Symposium's quality begun and sustained at Hopkins.

The emulation of<br />\ntypes is not in itself deplorable; what is deplorable is<br />\nthat the types to be copied do not even live in the present.<br />\nThe permissive parents of a generation tired of<br />\nwar and poverty sent us to the universities to act out<br />\nthe emotional conflict between parent and child which<br />\nthey never gave us. As a result, we play nursery school<br />\ngames with administrators and at the same time we are<br />\ncaptives of a social ethos which worships youth.<br /><br />\nFolk Hero No. 1<br />\nThe hippy, including the many that imitate him, is<br />\npurportedly the vanguard of the future, but actually is<br />\nmerely the anachronistic hero of old, slightly modified.<br />\nAs a result, he wears the costume of the WWI doughdoy, the headband of the American Indian, the sideburns of the western Plainsman or the smock of the<br />\nFrench Bohemian painter. He couples an antique figurine appearance with the noral . position that life in<br />\nany society that demands intelligence is a waste of<br />\nprecious time. \"There is as much surface presence<br />\nand internal absence,\" writes Aldridge, \"as one would<br />\nexpect to find in the most promising junior executive<br />\nat General Motors.\"<br />\nIn an era of interest in communication among the<br />\nyoung, and the era of most need for substantive personal<br />\ninteraction, the hippy offers us a life that is \"all a<br />\nmatter of soul speaking to soul, lovers passionately<br />\nsweating skin to skin, blown minds exchanging psychedelic<br />\nmash-notes--non thoughts floating in non words between<br />\nnon-entities.\" Empty minds, fearful of intellectural<br />\nstimuli, always capitulate.<br /><br />\nFolk Hero No. 2<br />\nThe activist type is a man of action and little else.<br />\nThe important thing to the activist is not the problem<br />\nto which he addresses himself but the riotous fervor<br /><br />\nNever Suffered<br /><br />\nemployed to effect its solution. Individual action against<br />\nreal social ills is sacrificed to the mass hysteria<br />\ndemanding that someone, somewhere, somehow, perfect the world before we are forced to enter it. The<br />\ninstant gratification of the nursery carried all the way<br />\nto the university (because our parents let us do their<br />\nliving for them), finally meets some authority against<br />\nwhich we rebel, often for no real reason. Since everyone tells us how very smart we are, no one has to do any<br />\nmind-work, only mouth-work.<br />\nIt is the ultimate paradox, however, that we offer<br />\na materialistic solution to very problem in a society<br />\nwhich we accuse of gross materialism. Worst of all,<br />\nwe criticize the inhuman quality of encroaching technology<br />\nin the \"New -Speak\" of technology. We do not solve<br />\nproblems in rhetoric, but of course that is the master<br />\nstrategy. For if the problems were solved we would<br />\nbe out of work.<br />\nIt is not that we haven't recognized legitimate social<br />\nills, it is simply that we create an emotional social<br />\nenvironment which makes their solution more remote.<br /><br />\nWe've Never Suffered<br />\nYouth today, above all else, suffers the ignominy<br />\nof never having suffered. We had no depression to spawn<br />\nmaterial want; no war to instill in us an emotional<br />\nattachment to country.<br />\nThe demand everywhere is for relevance. However,<br />\nit would require some thought to realize that after our<br />\ntechnology begins to master our environment(relevance),<br />\nwe will exist in an atmosphere of cultural atrophy because<br />\nof our insistance that all learning must relate to the<br />\npresent.<br />\nIf we adulate the hippy who lives a sensuous existence or the activist who acts in a mental vacuum,<br />\nwhere will the intellect reside? One could fear the polarization of all youth into two extreme types; Vegetable<br />\nMan and Violent Mechanical Man, the future's models<br />\nor the present folk heroes. Much depends on the extent<br />\nto which we believe our own vacuous rhetoric; if we<br />\nfollow types or if we reassert individual identity and<br />\naction. If our concern is employment of blacks, we<br /><br />\nhad better strive for those positions in society which<br />\ncan offer employment.<br /><br />\nYawning at the Mirror<br />\nThere is much concern as to whether we are up<br />\nto the challenge. We are very bored, undoubtedly more<br />\nso than housewives mesmerized by daytime television.<br />\nIf the problem is a lack of identity, it is perplexing to<br />\nsee how this is overcome simply the assertion of primitive masculinity in the form of mass protest. At the<br />\npersonal level we are, of course, convinced of our total<br />\nindividuality, unaware that personal expression, today, is<br />\nobviously a mirror image of mass expression.<br />\nWe are mostly appearance, clawing at the past in<br />\nthe guise of future quest. It is confusing how we think<br />\nourselves more individual by exchanging one costume<br />\nfor another or by our desire to shock instead of to<br />\nplacate. The General Motors type, for all his emptiness,<br />\nknows where he is going and does his job well. We do<br />\nnothing well, nor want to. Our choice is between careers<br />\nthat are more often than not \"two identical glasses of<br />\nsour milk.\" The ethos of instant gratification puts the<br />\nperception of acheivement beyond the<br />\npresent into<br />\ncategories, all of which are horribly establishmentarian.<br />\nIf we commit ourselves we are a part of some system,<br />\nsome closted circuit. We are not dedicated to anything<br />\nand would rather do something boring to collect some<br />\npay than settle into one of those terrible niches. It<br />\nwould negate the safety of mass orthodoxy.<br />\nWe are very religious.

One<br />\ncan point to Cleveland's limited campaigning to demonstrate the proposition<br />\nthat he lacked an important position,<br />\nbut Parker himself would lack importance if contributions to the campaign<br />\nwere measured by campaigning.<br />\nIn<br />\ngeneral, there can be little doubt of<br />\nCleveland's postion as the foremost<br />\nsupporter of the Parker campaign.<br />\nCleveland at this point was sixtyseven years old and, as he said, unable to open his mind to another term<br />\nof the Presidency. He was living in<br />\nPrinceton, New Jersey, and was a trustee of the local University.(The University President was Dr.Woodrow Wilson).<br />\nHe wrote the matter normally expected<br />\nof former Presidents; articles defending his conduct in the crises of his own<br />\nadministration, and rhetorical gessamer<br />\nurging the American people to be patriotic and observe their national holidays. To the conservative portion of<br />\nthe population, Cleveland was a venerable statesman enjoying a dignified retirement. The New York<br />\nTimes<br />\ncontinually declared him the<br />\nbest<br />\nDemocratic President since Jefferson,<br />\nimmensely preferable to the younger<br />\nDemocrats associated with, and including, Bryan.<br /><br />\nConsiderably More Popular<br />\nHowever, Cleveland had been considerably more popular with the conservative organs than with the succeeding<br />\nleaders of his own party. In 1896, the<br />\nBryan convention declined to pass even<br />\na perfunctory resolution applauding the<br />\nIncumbent Democratic President,Cleveland retaliated .in several ways. He<br />\ndelivered a eulogy for Bryan's success-<br /><br />\nful opponent, President McKinley. His<br />\nletters describe Bryan's form of politics<br />\nas \"fool business.\"<br />\nCleveland's attacks on Bryan are only<br />\nrarely characterized by precision. He<br />\ndid not make a flat statement that it<br />\nwas improper for a Presidential nominee<br />\nto deal with larger social issues thanthe<br />\ntariff, which had principally occupied<br />\nthe three Cleveland campaigns. However, the trend of the Cleveland strica<br />\ntures is not divergent from such<br />\nconcept. His statements indicate that<br />\nhe considered the American electorate<br />\nessentially conservative, that he considered Bryan irresponsible in seeming<br />\nto offer panaceas, and that he did not<br />\nbelieve such an approach could win a<br />\nnational election.<br /><br />\nCleveland's Democratic Zeal<br />\nCleveland's zeal for the Democrats<br />\nto reclaim conservatism was especially<br />\npronounced as he surveyed the activism<br />\nof President Roosevelt. According to<br />\nhis notions, the Democrats could defeat<br />\nRoosevelt in 1904 if their candidate<br />\nwere suitably conservative.<br />\nThere is nothing in the writings of<br />\nCleveland to indicate any awareness of<br />\nRoosevelt's popularity. The extensive<br />\ncorrespondence serves to re-inforce<br />\nrather than to broaden Cleveland's outlook. He communicated almost exclusively with men of similar age and circumstances, men with no feeling of the<br />\nand<br />\nsocial ills enunciated by Bryan<br />\nRoosevelt.<br />\nbestFor example, Cleveland's<br />\nprobably<br />\nknown correspondent was<br />\nRichard Watson Gilder, a minor poet and<br />\nlongtime editor of the Century Magazine.<br />\nLike Grover, Gilder was something of<br />\na living legend by 1904. Cleveland also<br />\ncorresponded with his ownformer AttorState,<br />\nney General and Secretary of<br />\nRichard C. Olney. Early in 1904 Olney<br /><br />\nand Cleveland were gathered into something of a mutual admiration society,<br />\nwith each repeatedly urging the other to<br />\nrun for President.<br /><br />\nhe noted that his best service would not<br />\nbe in a speechmaking function. This is<br />\na precise statement; Grover's prowess<br />\nas an orator was always limited.<br /><br />\nTo Carry His Own Banner<br /><br />\nCleveland did appear at a businessman's function for Parker at Carnegie<br />\nHall on October 21. He then felt the<br />\nneed to give equal time to his state of<br />\nresidence, and appeared at a function<br />\nin New Jersey. These appearances were<br />\nnot strikingly successful, and Cleveland<br />\nfirmly declined to campaign inConnecticut.<br /><br />\nAs the above suggests, Cleveland's<br />\nfirst choice to carry his own banner<br />\ninto the 1904 campaign was not Justice<br />\nParker. The former President preferred not only Olney,who was not an aspirant<br />\nfor the nomination, but the alternate<br />\nconservative aspirant, Justice George<br />\nto<br />\nGray of Delaware. His objection<br />\nParker may be ascribed to his lack of<br />\nIn<br />\nacquaintance with the candidate.<br />\neveryone else, except<br />\ncommon with<br />\nfelt<br />\npossibly Mr. Parker, Cleveland<br />\ninsufficiently informed as to the candidate's position on major issues. It is<br />\ntherefore understandable that he preferred Olney and Gray,who had pronounOlney and Gray, who had<br />\nferred<br />\npronounced pro-Cleveland records.<br />\nHowever, Cleveland finally advised a<br />\ncorrespondent to support Parker when<br />\nthe Justice's nomination appeared inevitable. He conceded that the candidate<br />\nwas \"clean, decent, and conservative.\"<br />\nHe rose to real enthusiasm when Parker<br />\nsent his famous telegram to the Convention affirming the gold standard. Cleveland shrewdly observed that the telegram<br />\nshown Parker in a position of<br />\nhad<br />\ncommand, and that Parker should continue to display command throughout the<br />\ncampaign.<br /><br />\nParker Did Not<br />\nParker did not. However, Cleveland<br />\nhimself, isolated and enjoying limited<br />\nto<br />\nsources of information, continued<br />\nbelieve that the Parker vote would be<br />\nimpressive. While he campaigned little,<br /><br />\nCleveland also wrote articles urging<br />\nvotes for Parker. He declined to write<br />\na piece on why young men should vote<br />\nDemocratic. Thus was lost a masterpiece of incongruity, although Cleveland<br />\nappeared young enough in contrast<br />\nParker's famous running mate.<br /><br />\nto<br /><br />\nImpeccable Record of Labor<br />\nThe Cleveland articles constitute an<br />\neffort to rework Parker into the author's<br />\nown image. We are told that Parker is<br />\nconservative, that he will not engage in<br />\nexperiments, that government under him<br />\nwill not be exciting, but will be conorderly. Parker's<br />\nand<br />\nscientious<br />\nimpeccable record of conscientious labor<br />\ndemonstrates his catalogue of virtues,<br />\nincluding, as it may appear, boredom.<br />\nAs has been pointed out, the resemblance<br />\nto the 1884 Cleveland appeals is almost<br />\neerie.<br />\nThere had been considerable social<br />\nferment in the generation since \"Grover<br />\nthe Good\" manned the battlements of<br />\n1884. But Grover Cleveland, who had<br />\nbeen living as a gentleman of leisure in<br />\nsecluded Princeton, had no notable consciousness of it.<br />\nCleveland's name<br />\nstands high in the small roster of those<br />\nwho were surprised by the outcome of<br />\nthe election of 1904.<br /><br />\nPAGE 9<br /><br />\nNEWS\u2014LETTER<br /><br />\n1969<br /><br />\nWald Naire on American Economy<br />\nBy STEVE BLUMENTHAL<br />\nDr. Wald's Tuesday speech at Hopkins was pleasant<br />\nand witty, but it showed a striking lack of understanding<br />\nof the realistic workings of the American economy.<br />\nTo put it bluntly, he failed to consider some of the<br />\nPractical results of his vague proposals\u2014includingwidespread unemployment and runaway inflation.<br />\nSuppose, for argument's sake, we accept the Wald<br />\nSpeech at face value; the leaders of government (especially the military) and the leaders of industry have<br />\nbecome an interchangeable, self-serving, \"interlocking<br />\ndirectorate.\" These men run the business of government contracts in such a way that your tax dollar is<br />\nused to raise the profits of their respective companies,<br />\nand provide a buffer in case of a drop in the market<br />\nfor their death machines.<br />\nThis is all well and good. But suppose we grant<br />\nDoctor Wald his desires. Suppose we cut away all but the<br />\nvery basic military programs and we drastically improve<br />\nthe quality of government control over the defense<br />\nindustries.<br />\nWhat then?<br />\nAs Dr. Wald freely admitted, the government expenditures permeate our economy. He showed an understanding of why the AFL-CIO supports the ABM (jobs,<br /><br />\nman, jobs). What will happen to the economy if all that<br />\nchanges? It is a fact that the government's huge contracts<br />\nprovide business for the firms involved in the military<br />\nindustrial complex. Those contracts also provide work<br />\nfor the men employed by those firms, in 365 of 368<br />\ncongressional districts.<br />\nRoosevelt set about creating government programs to<br />\ngive jobs to the unemployed. One could argue that<br />\nthrough large government defense contracts, our present<br />\nadministration, and the ones that immediately preceded<br />\nit, are preventing large scale unemployment. Suppose<br />\nthose programs were eliminated. Where are you going to<br />\nemploy all those factory workers, the people hit hardest<br />\nby a rise in the unemployment?<br />\nAre you going to look to the government for jobs<br />\nthat do not involve the military? What? Why won't those<br />\nprograms show the waste and corruption that government<br />\nprograms usually show? (Remember the Job Corps?)<br /><br />\nOh,So Desirable!<br />\nAs to the problems of quality control over government<br />\nproduction and adherence to contract terms, this of<br />\ncourse is desirable. So are a lot of things, but the<br /><br />\nproblem here is that in the development of a machine for<br />\nwhich there is no prototype, a cost estimate is exactly<br />\nthat; an estimate. If something doesn't work, the revision of plans and the resetting of machines (if not the<br />\ndevelopment of entirely new and unthought of plans and<br />\nmachines) often incurs enormous amounts of unexpected<br />\nexpense.<br />\nWhat about all that money that is going to be saved<br />\nthrough the elimination of defense contracts and the<br />\nrefining of quality control? An eighty billion dollar<br />\ndefense budget will provide a rather interesting budget<br />\nsurplus. If we return it to the people (from whom it<br />\ncame in the form of taxes), the resultant inflation would<br />\nrival anthing in history. If we turn it to the problems<br />\nof the cities we run into the same old problems of lack<br />\ntof _administrative personnel and expertise. This is not<br />\nto mention the very real problem that Big Brother is<br />\nnot only watching you, but has eliminated the last<br />\nvestiges of control you have over your own life.<br />\nDr. Wald is like too many \"liberals\" and far too<br />\nmany \"new leftists\" in that he can easily point out<br />\nthe problems of an economy based on defense expenditures, while he cannot offer any alternative programs that even border on reality.<br /><br />\nRecords<br /><br />\nDamned Good, But Not Quite Perfect I<br />\nBy STUART WATTLES<br />\nArthur -The Kinks.

It has<br />\nreceived little promotion, and consequnetly, although it is one of the best<br />\nblues-soul records to be released in the<br />\npast two or three years, it has attracted<br />\nit<br />\nless attention from the public than<br />\nmerits. King and Cropper, especially,<br />\nput down some of the smoothest riffs<br />\never to go on vinyl. The influence of<br />\nBooker T. and the M.G.'s is strong<br />\nthroughout, most likely because two of<br />\nthe players are regulars in M.G.'s(Steve<br />\nCropper and Donald \"Duck\" Dunn, the<br />\nbassist.)<br />\nThree of the ten cuts feature vocals by<br />\neach of the three guitarists. The best of<br />\nthese is \"Tupelo\", a slow blues thing<br /><br />\n\u2022 Q.**,,<br />\n';, \u2022 '..!\u2018<br />\nct!<br /><br />\nin which Pop Staples sings and plays a<br />\nmournful, ghostly lead. The other seven<br />\ncuts are instrumentals. The best of these<br />\nis \"Big Bird\", a driving, loud Booker T.<br />\nsong, which must surely be a classic in<br />\nelectric blues. Two tracks, \"Trashy<br />\nDog\" and \"Knock on Wood\" (another<br />\nSteve Cropper- Booter T. piece) are<br />\nplayed by King and Cropper without<br />\nStaples.<br /><br />\ninstead of two and make lots of filthy<br />\nlucre. (The butchery performed on\"The<br />\nWeight\" by the Bloomfield - Kooper syndrome springs instantly to mind. Who<br />\nwants to listen to Bloomfield get wired<br />\nout on a four day speed trip and<br />\nget<br />\ncompletely lost on his fingerboard, and<br />\nthen try to fight his way out of it by fucking up a perfectly good song? I don't<br />\nunderstand it.) This record, by contrast,<br />\nis solid. Each guitarist is playing a riff<br />\nthat could easily stand by itself, but at the<br />\nsame time,they don't step on each other's<br />\nfeet, try to grab the spotlight, or play<br />\nlouder than everybody else.<br /><br />\nWhat is most striking about this extraordinary record is its amazingly together<br />\nsound, which it maintains almost in spite<br />\nof itself.

Ronald Owens,<br />\nassistant admissions director,<br />\nstated that black students at this<br />\nwere people, not<br />\nuniversity<br />\nissues. In your editorial reply,<br />\nYou stated that black students at<br />\nHopkins had a point when they<br />\nclaimed that they were being<br />\ntreated too much as an issue, but<br />\nthat issues concerning black students affected both blacks and<br />\nWhites and that you felt obligated to cover them. Mr. Owens<br />\nis right. Though the shameful<br />\nway that white society treats<br />\nblack people is an important<br />\nissue, the black students are<br />\nPeople. Since the editors of the<br />\nNews-Letter are also people, I<br />\nfeel that their first obligation is<br />\nto black people rather than to<br />\nblack issues. If the black students feel that<br />\nNews-Letter<br />\ncoverage is making their lot at<br />\nHopkins worse, then I think that<br />\nthe editors' sense of concern for<br />\nfellow students should take precedence<br />\nover their sense of<br />\nJournalism, and that the editors<br />\nshould consult the black students<br />\nbefore writing about them.<br />\nSincerely,<br />\nSteven Barish<br /><br />\nKEEP ON SMILING<br /><br />\nSit there and smile Lincoln<br />\nGordon.

Three comments about<br />\nhis note seem necessary:<br />\n(1) My October 24 letter was<br />\nmeant chiefly to clarify one<br />\nstatistical point in my long letter<br />\nof October 17,where among other<br />\nthings I said, \"Even with severe<br />\ncompetition from the Ivy League<br />\nand elsewhere, about 3% of our<br />\nfreshmen are black.\"<br />\n(2) Mr. Reutter used no such<br />\nfigure.

Ross, and Steve Jones, have all<br />\nelucidated strikingly similar opinions in their<br />\nbids for the freshman vote on November 4.<br />\nWhen questioned on the issues of dormitory<br />\nregulations, freshman social life, coeducation,<br />\npass-fail, and the student role in the decisionmaking processes of the University, the four<br />\ncandidates differed only slightly, with that disagreement being in the particular details of the<br />\nissues.<br /><br />\n\"Equal Say\"<br />\nWhen asked about the role of the student in<br />\nmaking decisions in those areas which affect<br />\nhim, Charlie Trueheart said that \"the student<br />\nbody should have the power to develop its own<br />\ncurriculum.\" Trueheart also stated that students<br />\nshould have the right to decide dorn regulations.<br />\nAllen Ross, president of Gildersleeve house,said,<br />\n\"There should be an equal say in the senate<br />\non issues which concern faculty, and students.<br />\nA 60 year old Nobel prize winner or an 18 year<br />\nold Freshman; it is still one man, one vote.\"<br />\nRoss added, \"the students should decide for<br />\nthemselves what regulations, if any, should exist.\"<br />\nBoth David Charry, and Steve Jones are in favor<br />\nof an \"equal voice with the faculty\" with Jones<br />\nconsidering the administration as well. All the<br />\ncandidates placed limitations as to feasibility,<br />\non the scope of student power.<br />\nBoth Allen Ross and David Charry came out<br />\nexplicitly in favor of the proposed University<br />\nSenate.<br /><br />\nStudent Union<br /><br />\nThe one difference in the role which the<br />\nstudent should play in the University was vocalized<br />\nby David Charry. He advocated the formation of<br />\na student Union to get bargaining powers with<br />\nthe University. Charry said, \"There are professors who hide and don't teach classes. The<br />\nstudents have a right to benefit from them.\"<br /><br />\nCharry also felt the University should \"live up<br />\nto its promises in the catalogue\".<br />\nThe issue of mandatory physical education<br />\nis again one on which all the candidates agree.<br />\nTrueheart said,\" For the same reasons class<br />\nattendance is not required, gym should not be<br />\nrequired.\" Ross stated that \"there are intercollegiate and intramural sports for those who<br />\nwant to play, and groups could be organized to<br />\nteach those who want to learn new sports.\"<br />\nCharry said, \"all the administration has to do<br />\nis substitute a voluntary, structured program in<br />\nathletics\". Jones also went on record against<br />\np<br />\nmaasnt.datory gym, but offered that the gym should<br />\nbe on<br />\nopen for general use more than it has in the<br />\nEach candidate echoed what the others said<br />\non the coeducation issue. Trueheart said, \"It<br />\n(coeducation) will make the atmosphere a lot<br />\npleasanter.\" Ross noted, \"coeducation is a good<br />\nthing as long as the University won't have to<br />\nexpand to the point where it is no longer a small<br />\nUniversity.\" In all of Ross's statements, there<br />\nseemed to be a note of thoughtful caution.<br />\nSteve Jones stated that the greatest benefit<br />\nof coeducation from an academic standpoint is<br />\nthat it \"would strengthen<br />\ne7 the liberal arts.\"<br /><br />\nIt appears that the only real difference lies<br />\nin the personalities of the candidates. David<br />\nCharry is more for confronting the administration, if necessary, through sit-ins. Charry<br />\nis being supported by a group of students who<br />\nhave met several times previously, and voted<br />\nto support him for the presidency.<br />\nTrueheart stated that he is running in opposition to this group which he claims is trying to<br />\nbull its way into control of the freshman class.<br />\nThe group of freshmen is supporting candidates<br />\nfor each of the other offices.

His five touchdown and two-point conversion give him a 32 point total. PaulWeiss's four touchdowns place<br />\nhim second with 24 points. Fullback Steve Hata has three scores for<br />\n18 points.

Today, the freshman travel<br />\nup York Road to take on Towson State at 3:00 p.m.<br /><br />\nCross Country<br />\nBoth the varsity and freshman cross country teams are home<br />\ntomorrow. Their foes are the freshman and varsity harriers from<br />\nTowson State. The meet is scheduled to start at 2:00 p.m.<br /><br />\nLuckless Carnegie Mellon<br />\nJohns Hopkins' opponent next Saturday will be<br />\nCarnegie Mellon, a good but unlucky team.<br />\nCarnegie won its first game last week over<br />\nFranklin and Marshall after four consecutive<br />\nloses. The Hopkins coaching staff realizes that<br />\nCarnegie Mellon should not be taken lightly by<br />\nour team, if it wishes to win.<br />\nThe Tartans have a potent passing attack, and<br />\na solid running game. They have averaged 23.5<br />\npoints per game on offense. Sophomore Richie<br />\nSquires is a fine quarterback who has completed<br />\n12 touchdown passes this year. Split end Charley<br />\nPrice is a freshmen sensation who has caught<br />\nfour passes to Td's this year. The tight end is<br />\nTony Bugel, a co-captain of the team, who is<br />\nanother reliable receiver.<br />\nThe backfield is comprised of halfbacks Terry<br />\nBell, Tom Lombardo, and fullback, Rudy Tepsic.<br />\nBell, the workhorse of the group, has gained over<br />\n400 yards rushing their year and has caught 19<br />\npasses, two going for touchdown. Lombardo had his<br />\nbest game of the year against F.and M. He ran for<br />\n144 yards on only 23 carries.<br /><br />\nDefense Vulnerable<br />\nDefensively, the Tartans are vulnerable on<br />\nboth the ground and through the air. Carnegie<br />\nhad allowed its opponents 42.8 points a game before defeating Franklin and Marshall, 34 to 13.<br />\nHowever, the Diplomats were without the services<br />\nof its number one quarterback, Sam Long, and<br />\nits best runner, John Brunetti, who played so well<br />\nin F. and M.'s close loss to Hopkins earlier in<br />\nthe year.<br />\nHead Coach Joe Gasparella of Carnegie has<br />\nbeen attempting to patch up the defensive weaknesses of the club, and may have finally succeeded.<br />\nIf Hopkins is able to contain the offensive<br />\npower of Carnegie, a victory would most certainly<br />\nbe assurred. However, the Blue Jays themselves,<br />\nhave shown glaring defensive weaknesses in its<br />\ntwo losses this year, especially in last weeks<br />\ncontest with Hampton Sydney.<br /><br />\nBIA<br /><br />\noff balance as he tries to run around end. Weiss<br />\npresently is the second leading scorer on the<br />\nVarsity.<br />\nCarnegie has a tendency to fumble, and throw<br />\ninterceptions, furthering pressure on the defensive unit. This is also a concern of Coach<br />\nGasparella and must be exploited by the Blue<br />\nJays.<br />\nThe game against Hampton Sydney was one<br />\nthe Blue Jays would like to forget. Carnegie's<br />\n1 and 4 record is not a true indication of their<br />\npotential on the field. And coming off a win over<br />\nF. and M. will have added spirit to the Tartan's<br />\ngame. Hopkins though must win, if it is to have<br />\na respectible record.<br /><br />\nNOTES<br /><br />\nThe BIA freshman football season came to<br />\na close this week, as undoubtedly the toughest<br />\ngame was played. Clark, undefeated and untied,<br />\nmet Gildersleeve, with a 5-1 record, for the<br />\nDivision I title. Clark, known for its size and<br />\npower, could manage only a 6-6 tie in a wellplayed game that went into overtime. Don Krohn,<br />\nthe Clark quarterback, ran for his team's only<br />\nscore. A tight Gildersleeve defense prevented<br />\nthe extra points. Quarterback Bob Wilson,finding<br />\nhis receivers well covered, decided to keep the<br />\nball and also ran for a touchdown, accounting<br />\nfor Gildersleeve's only score.<br />\nAlthough spoiling its perfect record, Gildersleeve could not overtake Clark in the standings<br />\nand finished a game and a half behind first.<br />\nIn another overtime game, Adams and Baker<br />\nplayed to a scoreless tie. Neither team could<br />\nkeep control of the football and the game was<br />\nplagued with numerous interceptions.<br />\nIn Division II, Lazear was shut out twice by<br />\nSylvester and Royce. Sylvester put together their<br />\nwhole offense and came up with one touchdown<br />\nand the extra point. Its defense supplied the<br />\nremaining points with a safety.<br />\npassing of Mike<br />\nRoyce, on the brilliant<br />\nKestigian, also downed Lazear, 18-0.

Presently<br />\n$1.6 billion is allocated for<br />\nresearch and medical programs by<br />\nWashington, and this is now being trimmed. \"This is being<br />\npenny-wise and<br />\ndollar-foolish,\"<br />\nKnowles remarked,<br />\n\"Right now only 9,000 physicians are<br /><br />\nDr. John H. Knowles, Director of the<br />\nMassachusetts General Hospital: \"30 million people are not adequately cared for in<br />\nthis country.\"<br />\ncoming out of medical schools a year;<br />\nthere should be a 12-15,000.\"<br /><br />\nPoor Showing<br />\nHe cited nationwide health statistics<br />\nto document his statement that health<br />\ncare in the United States is grossly<br />\ninadequate. \"In overall health we are<br />\nfifth or sixthin the Western world, but<br />\nwe are tenth to fifteenth in the infant<br />\nmortality rate,\" Knowles stated. He<br />\nsaid that although the people with money<br /><br />\nreceive excellent health care,\"30 milion<br />\npeople are not adequately cared for in this<br />\ncountry.\" Much of the blame for these<br />\nfigures he placed on \"poor\" before and<br />\nafter care clinics.<br />\nOne of the worst areas of health care,<br />\nKnowles told newsmen, is mental health.<br />\n\"It's in incredibly bad shape,\" he asserted. Over half of all hospital patients in<br />\nthe United States are there for mental<br />\ndiseases and they have been traditionally<br />\nneglected, Knowles said. To improve the<br />\nsituation, Knowles suggested ending the<br />\nsegregation of mental patients from the<br />\nrest of the population and better staff<br />\ntraining to cope with mental sickness.<br />\nThe tremedous increase in hospital<br />\ncosts that has outstripped most other<br />\nconsumer services were attributed to<br />\nthree major causes by Dr. Knowles.<br />\nInflationary pressure on hospital costs,<br />\nlarge increases of staff wages in recent<br />\nyears to make up for the previous low<br />\nwages and high costs for sophisticated<br />\nnew medical equipment were listed by<br />\nKnowles as the major high rise culprits.<br />\nHe warned, though, against cutbacks<br />\nin hospital budgets to try to get health<br />\ncare more efficient. \"Private industry<br />\ncan cut costs, but quality care will<br />\nsuffer,\" he remarked.<br />\nIn a final question, Knowles refused<br />\nto endorse the legalization of marijuana.<br />\n\"Why should you encourage people to<br />\nsmoke anything,\" he asked rattling off<br />\nthe diseases, including cancer<br />\nand<br />\nbronchitis, that it can cause.<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS IN BRIEF<br />\nMeade,'Mary Jane'<br />\n'Gagged, Chained'<br />\nMargaret Meade, the well-known anthropologist, told<br />\nsenators on Monday that marijuana should not only be<br />\nlegalized, but should also be available for use at age 16.<br />\n\"There should be no more restrictions on smoking<br />\nmarijuana than on smoking cigarettes or drinking beer,<br />\n\"Dr. Meade told a Senate subcommittee.She later claimed<br />\nthat there is no evidence that marijuana is harmful in<br />\nitself or leads to the use of more dangerous substances.<br />\nStated the Columbia University professor, \"It (marijuana) doesn't lead to the excesses of behavior that alcohol<br />\ndoes and it does not have the toxic effects tobacco has.\"<br />\nDr. Mead said that she has tried marijuana once. \"I<br />\ndon't find it something I need,\" she stated, but added, \"if<br />\nI were young today, I'm sure I would be using marijuana.\"<br />\nIn her Senate testimony, Dr. Meade criticized the hypocritical parents who, she said, \"tell their children not<br />\nto smoke pot while they are holding a cocktail in one hand<br />\nand a cigarette in the other.\"<br /><br />\nThe 'Farce'.<br />\nThe Black Student Union at the University of Maryland<br />\nhas issued a strong policy statement condemning the<br />\nschool's newly instituted black studies program as a<br />\n\"farce.\"<br />\nThe Union demanded black student leaders be given a<br />\nkey role in organizing another program that would offer<br />\na degree in black studies.

The Student Union insisted that the program,<br />\ninitiated this semester, is not broad enough because it<br />\n\"concerns itself primarily with the continental United<br />\nStates and ignores the integral aspects such a program<br />\nneeds.\" The BSU statement continued that the program<br />\n\"lacks freedom to innovate, experiment or improve<br />\nitself.\"<br /><br />\n...The Relevant<br />\nAdorned with the red, green and black striped insignia<br />\nof the black revolution, a formerly abandoned warehouse<br />\nis the home of the Malcom X Liberation University in<br /><br />\nDurham, North Carolina.<br />\nClasses for a \"new generation of black people who have<br />\nbecome disenchanged with the entire system and who are<br />\nready now and willing to do something about it\" began<br />\nthis week with 50 students.

Staats<br />\nin opposition to the Labor Department's minority hiring<br />\nplan for Philidelphia construction workers.<br />\nThe plan, however, was defended by Labor Secretary<br />\nGeorge P. Shultz and Assistant Attorney Jerris Leonard<br />\nas necessary to combat what Leonard called \"blatant discrimination\" against blacks by construction unions in the<br />\nPhiladelphia area.<br />\nLeonard told a hearing of Ervin's Senate Judiciary<br />\nsubcommittee on separation of powers that of the six<br />\nunions in Philadelphia whose workers would be subject to<br />\nthe plan, four had 1 per cent or less minority members<br />\nas of June, 1969, one had less than 1.5 per cent and one<br />\nhad just under 2 per cent.<br />\nThe plan opposed by the AFL-CIO would require firms<br />\nbidding on federally financed construction contracts of<br />\n$500,000 or more to agree in advance one an \"affirmative\" program for hiring minority members. For ironworkers where Negro employees now number less than 2<br />\nper cent in the Philadelphia area, the contractor must<br />\nagree to try to raise his portion of Negro ironworkers to<br />\nbetween 5 and 9 per cent by the end of 1970, 16 to 20 per<br />\ncent the next year and 22 to 26 per cent by the end of 1973.<br />\nMcCellan and Ervin said this plan imposes racial<br />\nhiring quotas on construction firms which violates Title<br />\nVII of the 1964 Civil Rights Act. This act forbids racial<br />\nquotas on government construction jobs.<br /><br />\nA bitter and persistent outburst by Bobby G. Seale<br />\nforced an early recess Tuesday in the conspiracy trial<br />\nof the \"Chicago Eight.\"<br />\nJudge Julius J. Hoffman dismissed the jury more than<br />\nhalf an hour before the usual time after Mr. Seale, chairman of the Black Panther party, continued to shout accusations and questions at the judges and government<br />\nwitnesses. Judge Hoffman warned Mr. Seale that he had<br />\nthe power to \"have you gagged and chained to your chair.\"<br />\nThe seven other defendants then joined Seale in a<br />\nchallenge to the court's authority. Despite repeated orders<br />\nfrom the judge, all eight refused to stand when he recessed the court. It was the most tumultuous scene yet in the<br />\nfive -week-old trial of the eight men charged with conspiracy to incite a riot during last year's Democratic Convention.<br />\nIf Seale continues to escalate his outbursts as he has<br />\nover the past two weeks, and if Judge Hoffman follows<br />\nthrough on his threat to gag and shackle him, legal observers say the defense would almost certainly use it as<br />\nthe basis for a motion for a mistrial or an appeal. The<br />\nexchange began when Bobby Seale demanded to crossexamine a Chicago undercover policeman.<br /><br />\nBishops OK Lay<br />\nThe Roman Catholic Synod of Bishops concluded its<br />\n1969 sessionthisweek in a spirit of almost universal<br />\nsatisfaction among the participants.<br />\nThe tabulation of voting during their meetings showed<br />\nonly one issue on which delegates failed to demonstrate<br />\nnear unanimity. This was the question of whether lay and<br />\npriest experts should be permitted to assist the bishop<br />\ndelegates at future synod sessions.<br />\nExperts had a powerful impact on the shape of the<br />\ndecisions made at the Second Vatican Council, but were<br />\nexcluded from this synod and the one in 1967. Of the 143<br />\nbishops voting, 97 balloted in favor of admitting the experts in the future, 25 opposed the idea, 18 favored it with<br />\nqualifications and 3 abstained.<br />\nTwo other questions, which were the most complex<br />\nissues on which the synod sought to find a common mind,<br />\nattracted a large number of qualified yes votes.
