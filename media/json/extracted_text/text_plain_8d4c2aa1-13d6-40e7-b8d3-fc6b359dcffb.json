The<br />\nEducation Department was<br />\ncriticized for lacking a coherent<br />\nprogram and for its financial<br />\ndifficulties. There were other<br />\nreports of irreconcilable<br />\npersonality clashes within the<br />\ndepartment.<br />\n<br />\nDr. Walton proposes that there<br />\nbe a PhD program, a MAT<br />\ndivision, and \"some service to<br />\nundergraduates,\" but not an<br />\nundergraduate major.

The few songs of hers that<br />\none is able to categorize at all have<br />\nquickly been snatched up and turned into<br />\ntop-40 hits by a variety of groups. But<br />\nMiss Nyro herself has shunned such<br />\nlimelight, preferring to remain with her<br />\nstrange expressionist melodies that have<br />\ngarnered her a group of devoted fans who<br />\nemerge for appearances such as the one<br />\nshe gave Sunday night in Washington.<br />\nConstitution Hall, the DAR<br />\nauditorium, seems a strange place for<br />\nLaura Nyro's music, what with its boxes<br />\nnamed after the states and the flags of<br />\nthe thirteen colonies arranged across the<br />\nback of the stage.

It was quiet as the<br />\nfirst chords drifted out, a lone spotlight<br />\non the stage. Laura Nyro's music consists<br />\nof delicate chords and phrases which<br />\ncarefully relate to her alternately soaring<br />\nand dipping voice. An irregular rhythm<br />\nemerges from the myriad of riffs, some<br />\nrepeated time and again, a verbal couplet<br />\naccompanying. There are few songs that<br />\nallow foot-tapping or hand-clapping, and<br />\nshe does little to encourage such audience<br />\nparticipation.<br />\nThe first few notes from the piano<br />\nwere invariably greeted with the applause<br />\nof recognition, followed by a respectful<br />\nsilence for the song. The applause at the<br />\nend of the number grew as the concert<br />\n<br />\nwent on, but Laura did nothing more<br />\nthan turn to one side, take a sip of water,<br />\nturn back and nod to the audience, then<br />\nset her hands on the piano for the next<br />\nsong. There was no insipid between-song<br />\nchatter (\"I wrote this next one when...\"),<br />\nor tricks with the lights or tuning of<br />\ninstruments; there was just a woman and<br />\nher music, and an audience that grew to<br />\nrespect both as the evening went on.<br />\nImages of Dreams<br />\nHer lyrics are usually images, of the<br />\ncity and dreams of the country, their<br />\nsound complimenting the phrasing of the<br />\npiano. Strung together they make sort of<br />\nloose sense, provoking a subtle reaction<br />\nin the listener, her versatile voice<br />\nalternating with the piano, each taking<br />\ntheir turn at painting the thick, heavy<br />\nstrokes and the delicate, thin flourishes<br />\nthat convey the impressionistic picture,<br />\nsubtly framed and highlighted by the<br />\nwords.<br />\nThe applause was thunderous when the<br />\nfirst chords of her Fifth Dimension hits<br />\nwere heard and at the end of \"Save the<br />\nCountry,\" people wouldn't stop clapping,<br />\nand Laura Nyro had to delay her next<br />\nsong, and nod a fewmore times to the<br />\naudience. She seemed almost<br />\nembarrassed.

This year,90 percent<br />\nwill be elected by the voters in a<br />\ndirect primary to be held on May<br />\n16.<br />\nState Senator Harry James,<br />\nMaryland's part chairman, has<br />\nintroduced legislation in<br />\nAnnapolis to eliminate two<br />\nPrinciple areas of contention<br />\nbetween state law and national<br />\nparty rules on apportionment of<br />\ndelegates and on the Governor's<br />\nstatus as an ex-officio delegate.<br />\nThe James bill would<br />\n<br />\napportion delegates according to<br />\nan area's Democratic vote for<br />\nPresident in 1968 as well as its<br />\npopulation, and would eliminate<br />\nthe Governor as an automatic<br />\ndelegate to the convention.<br />\nThe national party rules are<br />\nlargely the result of reform<br />\nsuggestions made by the<br />\nCommittee on Delegate Selection<br />\nand Party Structure, commonly<br />\nknown as the McGovern<br />\nCommission.<br />\nKey Features<br />\nKey features include opening<br />\nthe selection process. to more<br />\nwomen, minorities, and youth,<br />\noutlawing unit rule voting, and<br />\nallowing no more than ten<br />\npercent of the delegates to be<br />\nchosen by the state committee.<br />\nStates that ignore these rules can<br />\nfind their slates of delegates<br />\n<br />\nchallenged at the convention.<br />\n\"We were one of the first to<br />\nimplement the McGovern<br />\nguidelines,\u2014 said Democratic<br />\nNational Committeewoman<br />\nMildred Otenasek. Maryland was<br />\nquick to institute a revamped<br />\nprimary emphasizing direct<br />\nelection of delegates. That<br />\nsystem, which presently is in<br />\neffect, calls for a direct primary<br />\nin which registered Democrats<br />\nsimultaneously choose delegates<br />\nand a presidential candidate.<br />\nUnder the new system, 48 of<br />\nthe 53 delegates to be chosen will<br />\nbe elected in the eight<br />\ncongressional districts. The voter<br />\nin each district elects six<br />\ndelegates, as well as a candidate<br />\nin the presidential preference<br />\nballot. The six who emerge are<br />\npledged to support the winner of<br />\n<br />\nthe preference primary in that<br />\ndistrict for at least two ballots at<br />\nthe convention, regardless of<br />\ntheir personal preference.<br />\nThe 48 delegates elected<br />\nwould then choose five at-large<br />\ndelegates who would be bound to<br />\nvote for the candidate with the<br />\nstate-wide plurality.<br />\nInadequacies<br />\nWithin the last year or so,<br />\ncertain inadequacies began to<br />\narise in the state's reformed<br />\nprimary system. In answer to<br />\ncriticism from some, the National<br />\nCommittee used its powers to<br />\nmove the state party further into<br />\nline with the McGovern<br />\nguidelines. A commission was set<br />\nup to alter the situation.<br />\nAs a result, the James bill was<br />\nwritten to seek to restore a<br />\nproper balance between emphasis<br />\n<br />\non population and on past voting<br />\nbehavior in allotting delegates to<br />\nthe various districts. The new<br />\nformula would increase<br />\nrepresentation of Baltimore's<br />\nlargely black seventh district by<br />\ntwo and Montgomery County's<br />\neighth district by one, both<br />\nadding to liberal strength.

The overall team<br />\neffort was the best of the year<br />\nwith sharp passing and good<br />\ndefense the keys to the evening's<br />\nvictory.<br />\nThe leading scorers for the<br />\nBlue Jays were senior guard Gary<br />\n<br />\nHandleman, who contributed 23<br />\npoints, and sophomore guard<br />\nBob Freedman, who had 19.<br />\nJohn Rutter added 16 points<br />\nfor Hopkins as did Bill Jews.<br />\nJeWs, who saw only limited<br />\naction in the second half, had 16<br />\nrebounds in the winning effort.<br />\nDim Spot<br />\nshot a fine 58% from<br />\nJays<br />\nThe<br />\nthe field, connecting on 38 of 66<br />\nattempts. Perhaps the only dim<br />\nspot of the evening was a poor<br />\nperformance at the free throw<br />\nstripe. Hopkins hit only 22 of 33<br />\nchances here for a poor 66%,but,<br />\nof course, it didn't matter in this<br />\none.<br />\nFor Dickinson, who never led<br />\nin the ball game, it was a long<br />\nnight. After the first ten minutes<br />\n<br />\nof play, the Red Devils found<br />\nthemselves behind, 23-12. Then<br />\nan already bad situation began to<br />\nget worse.

For most of<br />\nthe half, the Blue Jay lead ranged<br />\nbetween 30 and 40 points. The<br />\nbiggest lead of the game came at<br />\n6:28 on John Rutter's fast break<br />\nlayup. Hopkins then led by 41,<br />\n8443. Dickinson was unable to<br />\nclose the gap to less than 32<br />\nduring the entire second half.<br />\nThe win was refreshing for the<br />\nteam and brought renewed hope<br />\nfor a possible MAC play-off<br />\nberth.

In this<br />\nmanner the defense has often<br />\nforced opponents into careless<br />\nmistakes on which Hopkins has<br />\nfrequently capitalized.<br />\nOffensively, the team has been<br />\nsparked by the excellent outside<br />\nshooting of guard Paul Spence<br />\nfrom Delmar, N.Y., and forward<br />\nTom Davis of Newtown,Pa.<br />\n<br />\nsloppy, this fast break has been<br />\nSaturday afternoon at<br />\nthe cause of several open shots as<br />\nen, New Jersey, the<br />\nHobok<br />\nwell as some of the 15 to 20<br />\ns'<br />\nfencers lost to Stevens'<br />\nHopkin<br />\nturnovers a game that continue<br />\nTech, 15-12, in the most closely<br />\nto hamper the team.<br />\ncontested match between the<br />\nRebounding Strength<br />\nschools in recent years.<br />\ntwo<br />\nIn addition to Spence and<br />\nDavis, forward Greg DeLong of<br />\nTension and better team<br />\nConshocken, Pa., and center rivalry permeated the Tech gym,<br />\nJohn Sauter from Pennsauken, with several questionable calls<br />\nN.J., offer rebounding strength being made by the directors<br />\nunder the boards and defensive against the Hopkins' nine.

The<br />\nEducation Department was<br />\ncriticized for lacking a coherent<br />\nprogram and for its financial<br />\ndifficulties. There were other<br />\nreports of irreconcilable<br />\npersonality clashes within the<br />\ndepartment.<br /><br />\nDr. Walton proposes that there<br />\nbe a PhD program, a MAT<br />\ndivision, and \"some service to<br />\nundergraduates,\" but not an<br />\nundergraduate major.

But<br />\nMiss Nyro herself has shunned such<br />\nlimelight, preferring to remain with her<br />\nstrange expressionist melodies that have<br />\ngarnered her a group of devoted fans who<br />\nemerge for appearances such as the one<br />\nshe gave Sunday night in Washington.<br />\nConstitution Hall, the DAR<br />\nauditorium, seems a strange place for<br />\nLaura Nyro's music, what with its boxes<br />\nnamed after the states and the flags of<br />\nthe thirteen colonies arranged across the<br />\nback of the stage.

It was quiet as the<br />\nfirst chords drifted out, a lone spotlight<br />\non the stage. Laura Nyro's music consists<br />\nof delicate chords and phrases which<br />\ncarefully relate to her alternately soaring<br />\nand dipping voice. An irregular rhythm<br />\nemerges from the myriad of riffs, some<br />\nrepeated time and again, a verbal couplet<br />\naccompanying.

The applause at the<br />\nend of the number grew as the concert<br /><br />\nwent on, but Laura did nothing more<br />\nthan turn to one side, take a sip of water,<br />\nturn back and nod to the audience, then<br />\nset her hands on the piano for the next<br />\nsong. There was no insipid between-song<br />\nchatter (\"I wrote this next one when...\"),<br />\nor tricks with the lights or tuning of<br />\ninstruments; there was just a woman and<br />\nher music, and an audience that grew to<br />\nrespect both as the evening went on.<br />\nImages of Dreams<br />\nHer lyrics are usually images, of the<br />\ncity and dreams of the country, their<br />\nsound complimenting the phrasing of the<br />\npiano.

This year,90 percent<br />\nwill be elected by the voters in a<br />\ndirect primary to be held on May<br />\n16.<br />\nState Senator Harry James,<br />\nMaryland's part chairman, has<br />\nintroduced legislation in<br />\nAnnapolis to eliminate two<br />\nPrinciple areas of contention<br />\nbetween state law and national<br />\nparty rules on apportionment of<br />\ndelegates and on the Governor's<br />\nstatus as an ex-officio delegate.<br />\nThe James bill would<br /><br />\napportion delegates according to<br />\nan area's Democratic vote for<br />\nPresident in 1968 as well as its<br />\npopulation, and would eliminate<br />\nthe Governor as an automatic<br />\ndelegate to the convention.<br />\nThe national party rules are<br />\nlargely the result of reform<br />\nsuggestions made by the<br />\nCommittee on Delegate Selection<br />\nand Party Structure, commonly<br />\nknown as the McGovern<br />\nCommission.<br />\nKey Features<br />\nKey features include opening<br />\nthe selection process. to more<br />\nwomen, minorities, and youth,<br />\noutlawing unit rule voting, and<br />\nallowing no more than ten<br />\npercent of the delegates to be<br />\nchosen by the state committee.<br />\nStates that ignore these rules can<br />\nfind their slates of delegates<br /><br />\nchallenged at the convention.<br />\n\"We were one of the first to<br />\nimplement the McGovern<br />\nguidelines,\u2014 said Democratic<br />\nNational Committeewoman<br />\nMildred Otenasek. Maryland was<br />\nquick to institute a revamped<br />\nprimary emphasizing direct<br />\nelection of delegates. That<br />\nsystem, which presently is in<br />\neffect, calls for a direct primary<br />\nin which registered Democrats<br />\nsimultaneously choose delegates<br />\nand a presidential candidate.<br />\nUnder the new system, 48 of<br />\nthe 53 delegates to be chosen will<br />\nbe elected in the eight<br />\ncongressional districts. The voter<br />\nin each district elects six<br />\ndelegates, as well as a candidate<br />\nin the presidential preference<br />\nballot. The six who emerge are<br />\npledged to support the winner of<br /><br />\nthe preference primary in that<br />\ndistrict for at least two ballots at<br />\nthe convention, regardless of<br />\ntheir personal preference.<br />\nThe 48 delegates elected<br />\nwould then choose five at-large<br />\ndelegates who would be bound to<br />\nvote for the candidate with the<br />\nstate-wide plurality.<br />\nInadequacies<br />\nWithin the last year or so,<br />\ncertain inadequacies began to<br />\narise in the state's reformed<br />\nprimary system. In answer to<br />\ncriticism from some, the National<br />\nCommittee used its powers to<br />\nmove the state party further into<br />\nline with the McGovern<br />\nguidelines. A commission was set<br />\nup to alter the situation.<br />\nAs a result, the James bill was<br />\nwritten to seek to restore a<br />\nproper balance between emphasis<br /><br />\non population and on past voting<br />\nbehavior in allotting delegates to<br />\nthe various districts. The new<br />\nformula would increase<br />\nrepresentation of Baltimore's<br />\nlargely black seventh district by<br />\ntwo and Montgomery County's<br />\neighth district by one, both<br />\nadding to liberal strength.

Perhaps the only dim<br />\nspot of the evening was a poor<br />\nperformance at the free throw<br />\nstripe. Hopkins hit only 22 of 33<br />\nchances here for a poor 66%,but,<br />\nof course, it didn't matter in this<br />\none.<br />\nFor Dickinson, who never led<br />\nin the ball game, it was a long<br />\nnight.

Hopkins then led by 41,<br />\n8443. Dickinson was unable to<br />\nclose the gap to less than 32<br />\nduring the entire second half.<br />\nThe win was refreshing for the<br />\nteam and brought renewed hope<br />\nfor a possible MAC play-off<br />\nberth.

Coach Loveland likes to<br />\nstart most games with a rangy<br />\nfull court zone press that tests<br />\nthe opposition early, and he<br />\nexplores for their weakness,-s by<br />\nvariously switching between a<br />\ntenacious man to man defense<br />\nand a stingy 1-3-1 zone. In this<br />\nmanner the defense has often<br />\nforced opponents into careless<br />\nmistakes on which Hopkins has<br />\nfrequently capitalized.<br />\nOffensively, the team has been<br />\nsparked by the excellent outside<br />\nshooting of guard Paul Spence<br />\nfrom Delmar, N.Y., and forward<br />\nTom Davis of Newtown,Pa.<br /><br />\nsloppy, this fast break has been<br />\nSaturday afternoon at<br />\nthe cause of several open shots as<br />\nen, New Jersey, the<br />\nHobok<br />\nwell as some of the 15 to 20<br />\ns'<br />\nfencers lost to Stevens'<br />\nHopkin<br />\nturnovers a game that continue<br />\nTech, 15-12, in the most closely<br />\nto hamper the team.<br />\ncontested match between the<br />\nRebounding Strength<br />\nschools in recent years.<br />\ntwo<br />\nIn addition to Spence and<br />\nDavis, forward Greg DeLong of<br />\nTension and better team<br />\nConshocken, Pa., and center rivalry permeated the Tech gym,<br />\nJohn Sauter from Pennsauken, with several questionable calls<br />\nN.J., offer rebounding strength being made by the directors<br />\nunder the boards and defensive against the Hopkins' nine.
