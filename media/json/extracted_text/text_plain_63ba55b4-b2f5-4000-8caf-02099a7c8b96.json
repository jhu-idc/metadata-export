The library is probably<br />\nthe friendliest place on campus.(There is<br />\nsomething called the \"Grab Club,\"<br />\nlocated under the ground, that I never got<br />\nto see.)<br />\nA very old man with spotty hands and<br />\na long greenish beard standing at the<br />\ncirculation desk looked mad. \"Has the<br />\nbook I put a trace on come in yet?\" he<br />\nasked. The librarian put down the index<br />\ncards she was shuffling and asked what<br />\nthe book was. \"The Bible,\" said the old<br />\nman. The librarian went to look and the<br />\nold man muttered to himself: \"It's been<br />\nages since I put in that trace!! How the<br />\nhell long do you have to wait? I'll never<br />\nget a job!\" The librarian came back,<br />\nwaving her hands around to dry her nails.<br />\n\"Do you happen to know who the author<br />\nis?\" she asked. \"I am!\" yelled the old<br />\nman, wailing and gnashing his teeth.<br />\nThe library is constructed in levels,<br />\neach one lower than the last. I was<br />\namazed at all the shelf space everywhere.<br />\nAs I passed from level to level I saw many<br />\nthings written on the walls, some of them<br />\nin English. One grafition upset me a little,<br />\na lewd motto making an indecent<br />\nreference to the name \"Dick Nixon.\" Not<br />\n<br />\nonly was it grammatically senseless (I still.<br />\ncan't figure it out), but- it was an<br />\nunnecesary sler on an important<br />\nfigurehead. I believe a campus should<br />\nhave political concerns and be idleistic,<br />\nbut that is no way to talk about the Vice<br />\nPresident of the United States.<br />\nWay down<br />\nDown on the D-level, which is the<br />\nlowest, several students were installed in<br />\nnarrow spaces called \"carols,\" which is a<br />\nterms derived from the word \"corral.\" I<br />\napproached a bearded fellow who was<br />\nleaning deep in his \"carol,\" examining a<br />\nwaity .tome with intense scholasticity.<br />\nPiled around him were many intimidating<br />\nbooks: the Oxford English Dictionary,<br />\nPetronius' Satiricon, Hobb's Levithon,<br />\nThe Idea of History: The History of an<br />\nIdea, The History of Swear-Words,<br />\nTalking Through the Ages (a Life<br />\nmagazine gift book), French Gourmet<br />\nCooking, Ball My Wife!, Richard Burton's<br />\nAnatomy of a Melancholy, Love Story,<br />\nThe Splintering Vision: Woody<br />\nWoodpecker, an Isomoiph, and eighteen<br />\ncopies of the Bible.<br />\nThis student, Josh Glottis, is majoring<br />\nin Western Thought. He is writing on the<br />\nrelationship of ideas to speech froth the<br />\ndiscovery of the wheel to the death of<br />\nProust. Language is his major interest.<br />\n\"Irregardless of whatever dictations has<br />\nescaped the lips of the contemporaneous<br />\nphilologer or from his colleague the<br />\nlinguistician, the phenomena of verbial<br />\ndecrepitation is of integral signifitude to<br />\nwhoever holds up speech as a cultural<br />\ncriteria. That's my input,\" said Josh.<br />\nThe library is very warm and as Josh<br />\ntalked I felt lightheaded. Before I could<br />\nreply I became wuzy and slipped to the<br />\nfloor. Just then Dr. Rebate hurried by<br />\nand accidentally stepped on my face.<br />\n\"Ow,\" I offered, and Dr. Rebate gave me<br />\nhis office hours. When I was able to sit<br />\nup I saw Virgil holding a fragment of Dr.<br />\nRebate's cuff and kissing it feverishly. He<br />\nlooked at my face and took me over to<br />\nthe infirmary, where I-was once more<br />\nable to onbserve another John Hopkins<br />\ninstitution inaction.<br />\n<br />\n\f6/news-letter/february 27, 1973<br />\n<br />\nConcert provides aid<br />\nfor busted Hoppies<br />\nSince last Thursday,<br />\napproximately $250 has been<br />\nraised by the Homewood Defense<br />\nFund to go toward defraying<br />\nlegal costs for those arrested in<br />\nlast Tuesday's drug bust of six<br />\nHopkins students.<br />\nA concert Friday night by<br />\nMichael and his Band netted<br />\n$130 (after expenses) according<br />\nto Bill Benzon, an assistant to the<br />\nChaplain's Office.

The facility,<br />\ncomplete with sliding glass doors,<br />\nbore an amazing resemblence to a<br />\nHoward Johnsons'. Apart from<br />\nthe aesthetic weaknesses, the<br />\npool contributed to horribly<br />\nslow times all around.<br />\nComfort suggested that \"this<br />\nwas not a pool where a<br />\nconference championship should<br />\nbe held. The pool was slow and<br />\nthe lighting was terrible so the<br />\nswimmers had to take cautious<br />\nturns.\" On Friday, Vince Nigrelli<br />\ncon ,fletely missed a turn because<br />\nof the lighting and finished<br />\nfourth in the 220 free. In the<br />\n<br />\nSaturday finals, of the 100<br />\nbreaststroke, Bob Stoever almost<br />\ngot tangled up when one of the<br />\nlane markers snapped as he Was<br />\nmaking a turn.<br />\nDespite such problems.<br />\nHopkins had far less trouble<br />\nwinning than Comfort had<br />\nfeared. The Jays quickly<br />\nexpanded on Thursday's 6 point<br />\nmargin by sweeping the first<br />\nthree events on Friday. Mark<br />\nHorning and Don Remaly<br />\nfinished 1-3 in the 200 1M, Bill<br />\nMilne and Tom Stenovec had the<br />\nsame placings in the 200<br />\nbutterfly, and Bob Schwenkler<br />\nand Jim Finnerty went 1-4 in the<br />\n50 freestyle. Comfort called<br />\nSchwenkler's time of 22.6 an<br />\n\"incredible time, considering the<br />\neffect the pool had on the<br />\ntimes\".<br />\nAfter Drew Ranieri narrowly<br />\nbeat Jay Fortner in the 220<br />\nbackstroke, Horning won a close<br />\n200 free against Catholic's Toni<br />\nReynolds, and Stoever and Brian<br />\nWard finished 1st and 3rd in the<br />\n200 breaststroke, Stoever's time<br />\n<br />\nof 2:20.9 setting a conference<br />\nrecord. The Jays closed out the<br />\nevening with a slow but easy<br />\ntriumph in the 400 free relay and<br />\nled 96-64 after the first two<br />\nnights.<br />\nThe trials on Saturday<br />\nafternoon were highlighted<br />\nprimarily by Milne's slow time of<br />\n5:15 in the 500 free, (\"he was<br />\nbarely staying afloat,\" joked<br />\nComfort) and an incident<br />\ninvolving an unidentified Hoppie<br />\nwho made a turn so safe that<br />\nboth his feet landed on the pool<br />\ndeck.<br />\nThe Blue Jays got serious<br />\nwhen the evening began,<br />\nhowever, and faced their severest<br />\ncompetition in the final 7 events.<br />\nHorning won his third individual<br />\nevent, the 100 fly in a tight race<br />\nwith Catholic's Vince Bruns,<br />\nwhile Nigrelli was 4th. Finnerty<br />\nfinished second for Hopkins in<br />\nthe 100 free, sandwiched<br />\nbetween Catholic's Toni and<br />\nGene Reynolds. In this race, the<br />\ntimes did not coincide with the<br />\njudges' account and Schwenkler,<br />\n<br />\nthe 4th place finisher, had the probably the finest effort of the<br />\nmeet.<br />\nsecond fastest time.<br />\nAfter Chris Pazandak finished<br />\nStoever's second in the 100<br />\nin the diving competition,<br />\n5th<br />\nbreaststroke and Fortners'<br />\nattention<br />\nshifted to the 400<br />\nwas<br />\nbackstroke<br />\n100<br />\nthe<br />\nin<br />\nsecond<br />\nthe best JHU could do in the medley relay in which JHU and<br />\nnext two events but Milne broke Catholic were ranked 1-2 in the<br />\nthe mini-slump with an incredible College Division. Horning took a<br />\n4:44.9 in the 500 free. The time, small lead for Hopkins in the<br />\nonly 4/10ths from his best, was backstroke leg and Bob Stoever<br />\nhung on in the breaststroke.<br />\n<br />\nFencers end season<br />\nwith decisive victory<br />\n<br />\nand frosh Bob Baum picked up<br />\n\u2022 The Johns Hopkins Fencing<br />\nthree victories apiece.

L<br />\nwith one foul shot.<br />\nIn the scoring department,<br />\nHopkins was led by Jews (24),<br />\nFreedman (19), and Chuck<br />\nLa Berge (15). Leading<br />\nrebounders were Jews and Greg<br />\nDeLong.<br />\nAs usual, John Rutter played<br />\nhis steady game, but much of the<br />\ncredit for the victory must go to<br />\nsubstitutes Rasin and CampbellRasin because he jolted the team<br />\nout of its lethargic play and<br />\nCampbell for his hustle and<br />\nbrilliant play at the end of the<br />\ncontest when it counted the<br />\nGary Green scores<br />\nmost.<br />\n<br />\nLackluster final victory for cagers<br />\nThe varsity basketball team<br />\ntraveled to scenic Chestertown<br />\non the Eastern Shore to do battle<br />\nwith the Sho'men of Washington<br />\nCollege. In the season finale for<br />\nboth teams, Hopkins triumphed<br />\n82-80.<br />\nIn this game, like so many<br />\nothers this season, the Blue Jays<br />\nplayed below their potential.<br />\nInstead of establishing themselves<br />\nearly, the Blue Jays were content<br />\nto play just hard enough to stay<br />\nin the contest.<br />\nWashington played a box and<br />\none defense against Bill Jews who<br />\nmissed only one shot in the first<br />\nhalf and scored 18 points. The<br />\nseCond half, however, was a<br />\ndifferent story as the \u00b0thei<br />\nplayers could not get the ball ir<br />\nto the rangy forward. Had this<br />\nbeen pOssible. , the outcome<br />\nwould have been much different.<br />\nAl Robinson, only senior on<br />\nthe team, sat on the bench the<br />\nentire contest. The closest he<br />\ncame to participating was when<br />\nreferee Cribbs (the same official<br />\nwho worked the Catholic game)<br />\nengaged Al in a verbal battle.<br />\nThe game itself was as close as<br />\nthe final score indicates. For the<br />\ncontest, Hopkins shot 49% to<br />\n48% for Washington. The game<br />\nwas won at the foul line,<br />\nhowever, as the Blue Jays<br />\nconnected on 16 of 27 from the<br />\ncharity stripe while the Sho'men<br />\nmanaged only 12 of 24.<br />\nOutrebounded 41-32, Hopkins<br />\nwon the battle of the fouls,<br />\ncommitting two more than<br />\nWashington.<br />\nIn the first half, both teams<br />\nwere content to trade baskets.<br />\nAll forms of defense (other than<br />\nthe foul) were abandoned as both<br />\nteams ran and shot. At the half,<br />\nWashington led 46-44.<br />\nHopkins fell behind in the<br />\nsecond half and allowed the<br />\nSho'men to enjoy as much as a<br />\nnine point lead at times. When<br />\nWashington went into its stall,<br />\nthe ball hawking Blue Jays<br />\n<br />\nturned the game around to earn<br />\nthe victory.<br />\nWith three and one half<br />\nminutes remaining, Washington<br />\nled 80-76. From then on,<br />\nHopkins did all of the scoring.<br />\nGlen Rasin bombed one in from<br />\n30 feet with 2:56 showing on the<br />\nclock.

After beating<br />\nSwarthmore College the weekend<br />\nbefore, hopes were high for a<br />\ngood finish. Fate however, as it<br />\nhad all season, doomed the Jays<br />\nto a ninth place finish.<br />\nSophomore Ron Pucillo,<br />\nHopkin's 118 pounder, hoping to<br />\nbetter last year's fourth place<br />\nfinish, received a first round bye<br />\nand defeated an Albright wrestler<br />\nby a referee decision on Friday.<br />\nIn the semifinals on Saturday<br />\nRon lost to a grappler from<br />\nMoravian in a hard fought match.<br />\nRon then bounced back to<br />\nsoundly beat a Lebanon Valley<br />\nopponent 11-4. In the<br />\nconsolation finals Pucillo took<br />\nfourth place, losing 5-0 to<br />\nMcGinly of Wilkes College.<br />\nMike Privitera, one of three<br />\nfreshmen wrestling for Hopkins,<br />\nlost in the first round of the 126<br />\nlb. class. Since Mike's opponent<br />\nlast in the following round any<br />\nhopes of wrestling again were<br />\ndestroyed. Frosh Dave Mulock<br />\nsuffered a similar fate in the 158<br />\nlb. class.. A Delaware Valley<br />\n<br />\nwrestler defeated Dave in a<br />\nlackluster match.

The library is probably<br />\nthe friendliest place on campus.(There is<br />\nsomething called the \"Grab Club,\"<br />\nlocated under the ground, that I never got<br />\nto see.)<br />\nA very old man with spotty hands and<br />\na long greenish beard standing at the<br />\ncirculation desk looked mad. \"Has the<br />\nbook I put a trace on come in yet?\" he<br />\nasked. The librarian put down the index<br />\ncards she was shuffling and asked what<br />\nthe book was. \"The Bible,\" said the old<br />\nman. The librarian went to look and the<br />\nold man muttered to himself: \"It's been<br />\nages since I put in that trace!! How the<br />\nhell long do you have to wait? I'll never<br />\nget a job!\" The librarian came back,<br />\nwaving her hands around to dry her nails.<br />\n\"Do you happen to know who the author<br />\nis?\" she asked. \"I am!\" yelled the old<br />\nman, wailing and gnashing his teeth.<br />\nThe library is constructed in levels,<br />\neach one lower than the last. I was<br />\namazed at all the shelf space everywhere.<br />\nAs I passed from level to level I saw many<br />\nthings written on the walls, some of them<br />\nin English. One grafition upset me a little,<br />\na lewd motto making an indecent<br />\nreference to the name \"Dick Nixon.\" Not<br /><br />\nonly was it grammatically senseless (I still.<br />\ncan't figure it out), but- it was an<br />\nunnecesary sler on an important<br />\nfigurehead. I believe a campus should<br />\nhave political concerns and be idleistic,<br />\nbut that is no way to talk about the Vice<br />\nPresident of the United States.<br />\nWay down<br />\nDown on the D-level, which is the<br />\nlowest, several students were installed in<br />\nnarrow spaces called \"carols,\" which is a<br />\nterms derived from the word \"corral.\" I<br />\napproached a bearded fellow who was<br />\nleaning deep in his \"carol,\" examining a<br />\nwaity .tome with intense scholasticity.<br />\nPiled around him were many intimidating<br />\nbooks: the Oxford English Dictionary,<br />\nPetronius' Satiricon, Hobb's Levithon,<br />\nThe Idea of History: The History of an<br />\nIdea, The History of Swear-Words,<br />\nTalking Through the Ages (a Life<br />\nmagazine gift book), French Gourmet<br />\nCooking, Ball My Wife!, Richard Burton's<br />\nAnatomy of a Melancholy, Love Story,<br />\nThe Splintering Vision: Woody<br />\nWoodpecker, an Isomoiph, and eighteen<br />\ncopies of the Bible.<br />\nThis student, Josh Glottis, is majoring<br />\nin Western Thought. He is writing on the<br />\nrelationship of ideas to speech froth the<br />\ndiscovery of the wheel to the death of<br />\nProust. Language is his major interest.<br />\n\"Irregardless of whatever dictations has<br />\nescaped the lips of the contemporaneous<br />\nphilologer or from his colleague the<br />\nlinguistician, the phenomena of verbial<br />\ndecrepitation is of integral signifitude to<br />\nwhoever holds up speech as a cultural<br />\ncriteria. That's my input,\" said Josh.<br />\nThe library is very warm and as Josh<br />\ntalked I felt lightheaded. Before I could<br />\nreply I became wuzy and slipped to the<br />\nfloor. Just then Dr. Rebate hurried by<br />\nand accidentally stepped on my face.<br />\n\"Ow,\" I offered, and Dr. Rebate gave me<br />\nhis office hours. When I was able to sit<br />\nup I saw Virgil holding a fragment of Dr.<br />\nRebate's cuff and kissing it feverishly. He<br />\nlooked at my face and took me over to<br />\nthe infirmary, where I-was once more<br />\nable to onbserve another John Hopkins<br />\ninstitution inaction.<br /><br />\n6/news-letter/february 27, 1973<br /><br />\nConcert provides aid<br />\nfor busted Hoppies<br />\nSince last Thursday,<br />\napproximately $250 has been<br />\nraised by the Homewood Defense<br />\nFund to go toward defraying<br />\nlegal costs for those arrested in<br />\nlast Tuesday's drug bust of six<br />\nHopkins students.<br />\nA concert Friday night by<br />\nMichael and his Band netted<br />\n$130 (after expenses) according<br />\nto Bill Benzon, an assistant to the<br />\nChaplain's Office.

The facility,<br />\ncomplete with sliding glass doors,<br />\nbore an amazing resemblence to a<br />\nHoward Johnsons'. Apart from<br />\nthe aesthetic weaknesses, the<br />\npool contributed to horribly<br />\nslow times all around.<br />\nComfort suggested that \"this<br />\nwas not a pool where a<br />\nconference championship should<br />\nbe held. The pool was slow and<br />\nthe lighting was terrible so the<br />\nswimmers had to take cautious<br />\nturns.\" On Friday, Vince Nigrelli<br />\ncon ,fletely missed a turn because<br />\nof the lighting and finished<br />\nfourth in the 220 free. In the<br /><br />\nSaturday finals, of the 100<br />\nbreaststroke, Bob Stoever almost<br />\ngot tangled up when one of the<br />\nlane markers snapped as he Was<br />\nmaking a turn.<br />\nDespite such problems.<br />\nHopkins had far less trouble<br />\nwinning than Comfort had<br />\nfeared. The Jays quickly<br />\nexpanded on Thursday's 6 point<br />\nmargin by sweeping the first<br />\nthree events on Friday. Mark<br />\nHorning and Don Remaly<br />\nfinished 1-3 in the 200 1M, Bill<br />\nMilne and Tom Stenovec had the<br />\nsame placings in the 200<br />\nbutterfly, and Bob Schwenkler<br />\nand Jim Finnerty went 1-4 in the<br />\n50 freestyle. Comfort called<br />\nSchwenkler's time of 22.6 an<br />\n\"incredible time, considering the<br />\neffect the pool had on the<br />\ntimes\".<br />\nAfter Drew Ranieri narrowly<br />\nbeat Jay Fortner in the 220<br />\nbackstroke, Horning won a close<br />\n200 free against Catholic's Toni<br />\nReynolds, and Stoever and Brian<br />\nWard finished 1st and 3rd in the<br />\n200 breaststroke, Stoever's time<br /><br />\nof 2:20.9 setting a conference<br />\nrecord. The Jays closed out the<br />\nevening with a slow but easy<br />\ntriumph in the 400 free relay and<br />\nled 96-64 after the first two<br />\nnights.<br />\nThe trials on Saturday<br />\nafternoon were highlighted<br />\nprimarily by Milne's slow time of<br />\n5:15 in the 500 free, (\"he was<br />\nbarely staying afloat,\" joked<br />\nComfort) and an incident<br />\ninvolving an unidentified Hoppie<br />\nwho made a turn so safe that<br />\nboth his feet landed on the pool<br />\ndeck.<br />\nThe Blue Jays got serious<br />\nwhen the evening began,<br />\nhowever, and faced their severest<br />\ncompetition in the final 7 events.<br />\nHorning won his third individual<br />\nevent, the 100 fly in a tight race<br />\nwith Catholic's Vince Bruns,<br />\nwhile Nigrelli was 4th. Finnerty<br />\nfinished second for Hopkins in<br />\nthe 100 free, sandwiched<br />\nbetween Catholic's Toni and<br />\nGene Reynolds. In this race, the<br />\ntimes did not coincide with the<br />\njudges' account and Schwenkler,<br /><br />\nthe 4th place finisher, had the probably the finest effort of the<br />\nmeet.<br />\nsecond fastest time.<br />\nAfter Chris Pazandak finished<br />\nStoever's second in the 100<br />\nin the diving competition,<br />\n5th<br />\nbreaststroke and Fortners'<br />\nattention<br />\nshifted to the 400<br />\nwas<br />\nbackstroke<br />\n100<br />\nthe<br />\nin<br />\nsecond<br />\nthe best JHU could do in the medley relay in which JHU and<br />\nnext two events but Milne broke Catholic were ranked 1-2 in the<br />\nthe mini-slump with an incredible College Division. Horning took a<br />\n4:44.9 in the 500 free. The time, small lead for Hopkins in the<br />\nonly 4/10ths from his best, was backstroke leg and Bob Stoever<br />\nhung on in the breaststroke.<br /><br />\nFencers end season<br />\nwith decisive victory<br /><br />\nand frosh Bob Baum picked up<br />\n\u2022 The Johns Hopkins Fencing<br />\nthree victories apiece.

L<br />\nwith one foul shot.<br />\nIn the scoring department,<br />\nHopkins was led by Jews (24),<br />\nFreedman (19), and Chuck<br />\nLa Berge (15). Leading<br />\nrebounders were Jews and Greg<br />\nDeLong.<br />\nAs usual, John Rutter played<br />\nhis steady game, but much of the<br />\ncredit for the victory must go to<br />\nsubstitutes Rasin and CampbellRasin because he jolted the team<br />\nout of its lethargic play and<br />\nCampbell for his hustle and<br />\nbrilliant play at the end of the<br />\ncontest when it counted the<br />\nGary Green scores<br />\nmost.<br /><br />\nLackluster final victory for cagers<br />\nThe varsity basketball team<br />\ntraveled to scenic Chestertown<br />\non the Eastern Shore to do battle<br />\nwith the Sho'men of Washington<br />\nCollege. In the season finale for<br />\nboth teams, Hopkins triumphed<br />\n82-80.<br />\nIn this game, like so many<br />\nothers this season, the Blue Jays<br />\nplayed below their potential.<br />\nInstead of establishing themselves<br />\nearly, the Blue Jays were content<br />\nto play just hard enough to stay<br />\nin the contest.<br />\nWashington played a box and<br />\none defense against Bill Jews who<br />\nmissed only one shot in the first<br />\nhalf and scored 18 points. The<br />\nseCond half, however, was a<br />\ndifferent story as the \u00b0thei<br />\nplayers could not get the ball ir<br />\nto the rangy forward. Had this<br />\nbeen pOssible. , the outcome<br />\nwould have been much different.<br />\nAl Robinson, only senior on<br />\nthe team, sat on the bench the<br />\nentire contest. The closest he<br />\ncame to participating was when<br />\nreferee Cribbs (the same official<br />\nwho worked the Catholic game)<br />\nengaged Al in a verbal battle.<br />\nThe game itself was as close as<br />\nthe final score indicates. For the<br />\ncontest, Hopkins shot 49% to<br />\n48% for Washington. The game<br />\nwas won at the foul line,<br />\nhowever, as the Blue Jays<br />\nconnected on 16 of 27 from the<br />\ncharity stripe while the Sho'men<br />\nmanaged only 12 of 24.<br />\nOutrebounded 41-32, Hopkins<br />\nwon the battle of the fouls,<br />\ncommitting two more than<br />\nWashington.<br />\nIn the first half, both teams<br />\nwere content to trade baskets.<br />\nAll forms of defense (other than<br />\nthe foul) were abandoned as both<br />\nteams ran and shot. At the half,<br />\nWashington led 46-44.<br />\nHopkins fell behind in the<br />\nsecond half and allowed the<br />\nSho'men to enjoy as much as a<br />\nnine point lead at times. When<br />\nWashington went into its stall,<br />\nthe ball hawking Blue Jays<br /><br />\nturned the game around to earn<br />\nthe victory.<br />\nWith three and one half<br />\nminutes remaining, Washington<br />\nled 80-76.

Fate however, as it<br />\nhad all season, doomed the Jays<br />\nto a ninth place finish.<br />\nSophomore Ron Pucillo,<br />\nHopkin's 118 pounder, hoping to<br />\nbetter last year's fourth place<br />\nfinish, received a first round bye<br />\nand defeated an Albright wrestler<br />\nby a referee decision on Friday.<br />\nIn the semifinals on Saturday<br />\nRon lost to a grappler from<br />\nMoravian in a hard fought match.<br />\nRon then bounced back to<br />\nsoundly beat a Lebanon Valley<br />\nopponent 11-4.

Since Mike's opponent<br />\nlast in the following round any<br />\nhopes of wrestling again were<br />\ndestroyed. Frosh Dave Mulock<br />\nsuffered a similar fate in the 158<br />\nlb. class.. A Delaware Valley<br /><br />\nwrestler defeated Dave in a<br />\nlackluster match. He was then<br />\nbeaten in the quarterfinals,<br />\nterminating Mulock's wrestling<br />\ncareer for this year.<br />\nIn the 134 lb. class sophomore<br />\nClark Kingery, looking to better<br />\nlast years fourth place finish, tore<br />\nup a grappler from Albright 10-4.<br />\nIn the quarter finals Clark beat a<br />\nHaverfoN wrestler 5-2.

Seeking<br />\nrevenge, Kingery won his next<br />\nmatch in the closing seconds, 7-6,<br />\nby putting his opponent on his<br />\nback.
