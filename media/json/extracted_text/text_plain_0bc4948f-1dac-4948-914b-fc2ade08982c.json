He cited examples of how presidents have<br />\nviolated treaties to making covert<br />\narms sales,justifying their actions<br />\nto the American public by brandishing the threat of a \"red tide.\"<br />\nExamples of abuse of presidential power, he said, have ranged<br />\nfrom Watergate to the War,<br />\nPowers Act.

Instead, he<br />\nadvocated an accountable one.<br />\nThe President can make a decision for peace, he said, but Congress must ratify it. He disagreed<br />\nwith former CIA director<br />\nWilliam Casey's opinion that<br />\n\"there are things Congress<br />\ndoesn't need to know.\"<br />\nIn a tongue-in-cheek manner,<br />\nAnderson referred to former CIA<br />\nDirector Admiral Turner's wish<br />\nthat better relations be built between the CIA and Congress,<br />\nhardly a simple task with the CIA<br />\nwitholding information from<br />\nCongress, he said.<br />\nOf course, that accountability<br />\nof a president is difficult to<br />\nguarantee.

But all Soviet<br />\nuniversities have sophisticated<br />\ncomputers, he said, and<br />\npresumably they might be used to<br />\nallow newspaper-to-newspaper<br />\ncommunication.<br />\nKarraker said that direct<br />\ncomputer-to-computer linkups<br />\nbetween Western and Soviet college newspapers would be an<br />\nhistoric breakthrough. \"Our best<br />\ninformation is that the Soviets<br />\nhave few microcomputers, keep<br />\naccess to them highly controlled<br />\nand allow little computer communication outside the country,\"<br />\nhe said. \"Allowing our college<br />\n<br />\nnewspapers to communicate<br />\ndirectly with theirs would indicate<br />\nan important shift in Soviet thinking,\" he continued. \"The tests<br />\nbetween ISIS and the Soviet embassy in Ottawa are a very important first step.\"<br />\nIn Washington, Alexander<br />\nMalyskin, the Soviet Embassy's<br />\nsenior information officer, said<br />\nthat Bogdanov's offer extended to<br />\nCanadian universities also extends to be U.S. colleges. \"This is<br />\nsomething to build bridges between both countries,\" he said.<br />\n\"It would be helpful for young<br />\npeople to discuss different problems, perhaps dealing with<br />\neducation, sports, public life,<br />\nlove or family,\" he continued.<br />\n\"There are a lot of problems of<br />\ncommon interest.

Originally formed in<br />\nJanuary, /986 in opposition to the<br />\nUniversity's refusal to divest from<br />\ncompanies doing business in South<br />\nAfrica, the Coalition now has a much<br />\nwider agenda, whose issues range<br />\nfrom banks' divestment, to housing<br />\nin Baltimore, to the Central Intelligence Agency's on-campus<br />\nrecruitment of students.<br />\n1. N-L: Where does the<br />\nCoalition stand now?<br />\nBond explained, \"We're<br />\nbroadening our concerns solely<br />\nfrom South African apartheid into two other issues. One concerns<br />\ndomestic apartheid and how<br />\nracism here can be combatted.<br />\nOur main immediate goals are to<br />\nhalt banks' discriminatory redlining practices.<br />\nHe said that the Coalition \"got<br />\na great victory on that from<br />\nMaryland National in November,<br />\nwith the help of other groups,\"<br />\nand is now addressing the issue<br />\nof housing with other banks.<br />\nThe second concern, he said,<br />\n\"is attacking other immoral U.S.<br />\nforeign policies.\"<br />\n2. N-L: What is the Coalition's purpose?<br />\n\"Initially, it was simply divestment,\u2014 said Bond. \"Now, we<br />\nwant divestment and more. In<br />\ngeneral terms, we want social<br />\nchange: and end to racism and<br />\neconomic injustice.\"<br />\n3. N-L: Is University divestment still a practical goal?<br />\n\"Very much so,\" replied<br />\nBond. \"We're considering the<br />\nlast divestment vote invalid,<br />\nbecause many Trustees were in<br />\nconflict of interest, and we're<br />\nconsidering other avenues to have<br />\nthis issue addressed.\"<br />\n4. N-L: Why has the Coalition expanded its horizons<br />\nbeyond the issue of divestment?<br />\nBond cited \"natural links\" in<br />\nthe Coalition's activities, citing<br />\nthe agreement with Maryland National Bank for the bank to provide $50 million in loans for<br />\n<br />\nArguably. the Coalition reached a<br />\npeak in late September and early<br />\nOctober, 1986, when it successfully<br />\nwon the University's approval to<br />\nbuild a protest shanty following the<br />\narrests of fourteen protesters surrounding an illegal, Coalition-built<br />\nshanty only three days earlier.<br />\nA month later, Coalition members<br />\nlay down in aisles to hinder Board of<br />\nTrustees members from leaving their<br />\nmeeting, and then disrupted the<br />\nsubsequent Trustees' news con-<br />\n<br />\nBaltimore's lower-income and<br />\nminority neighborhoods. \"It was<br />\nlogical for us to go then to<br />\nHopkins,\" said Bond, \"which<br />\nowns 140 houses in East<br />\nBaltimore, and try to put this<br />\nmoney to good use.\"<br />\nGenest focused on the anti-CIA<br />\non-campus recruitment protest,<br />\nsaying that the CIA has provided<br />\ninformation to South African<br />\nforces resisting African National<br />\nCongress activities. \"A further<br />\nlink,\" he added, \"is that covert<br />\nfunds are being provided to Jonas<br />\nSavimbi of UNITA,<br />\n\"a group he<br />\nsaid is trying to overthrow the<br />\nAngolan government with South<br />\n<br />\nPatrick Bond<br />\n<br />\nference. The Coalition then moved<br />\nto Garland Hall, which it renamed<br />\nMandela Hall, for a nine day sit-in in<br />\nwhich it demanded, but failed to<br />\nachieve, University divestment.<br />\nAround this time, oppostion to the<br />\nCoalition's activities began to grow<br />\nand become more organized,<br />\nmanifesting itself in such forums as<br />\ncounter-protests to Coalition rallies,<br />\nand posters opposing Coalition activities. This opposition, though, has<br />\nnot necessarily implied changing<br />\n<br />\nAfrican assistance.<br />\n5. N-L: Is the shanty an effective protest symbol at the moment, and if so, can it continue<br />\nto be one?<br />\nBond responded, \"The shanty<br />\nreminds people of the terrible living conditions that this institution<br />\nis in part responsible for. We<br />\nknow some folks are tired of it,<br />\nso maybe we'll have a chance to<br />\nintrodouce the concept at the<br />\nHospital.\"<br />\nGenest explained that the remains of the shanty. destroyed<br />\nFebruary 26, in the Lower Quad<br />\n\"is a reminder of the lack of<br />\nrespect for freedom of expression \u2014 and that \"for a time, it<br />\nlooks like [a new shanty] is going to be absent from the Lower<br />\nQuad.<br />\n6. N-L: Is the Coalition<br />\nsatisfied with its News-Letter<br />\ncoverage, in terms of amount<br />\nand/or objectivity?<br />\nBond and Genest expressed<br />\ntheir disappointment with<br />\ncoverage, though Genest added,<br />\n\"It's better than the Gazette,<br />\nwhich we consider to be a halfrate Pravda.\"<br />\nCalling the News-Letter's<br />\ncoverage of Coalition activities<br />\n\"spotty,\" Bond noted that the<br />\npaper \"missed\" the settlement<br />\nwith Maryland National, and had<br />\ngiven students the impression<br />\nthat the Coalition had \"invented\"<br />\nthe story of file clippings in<br />\nCoalition members' student loan<br />\nfiles \"even though the day before<br />\npublication, a reporter confirmed their existence.\"<br />\nGenest focused on recent<br />\n<br />\nstudent views on divestment.<br />\nWe<br />\nCoalition<br />\ninterviewed<br />\nspokesmen Patrick Bond and Paul<br />\nGenest to attempt to address the<br />\nissue of the Coalition's status, as well<br />\nas other issues that we believe<br />\nshould be addressed and have been<br />\naddressed inadequately. We have<br />\ncondensed and summarized their<br />\nresponses based on notes taken<br />\nduring the interview.<br />\n<br />\nPaul Genest<br />\n<br />\neditorials. \"The editorials are too<br />\ngentle and accomodating toward<br />\nthe Administration,\" he asserted.<br />\n\"An attitude of greater vigilance<br />\nwould be more appropriate.\"<br />\n7. N-L: What is the Coalition's image of itself?<br />\nGenest responded that the<br />\nCoalition tries to \"perform a<br />\ncritical function in helping to<br />\nraise social conscience,\" while<br />\nBond added, \"We hope our<br />\nsometimes confrontational tactics<br />\nhelp teach other students to be<br />\neffective.\"<br />\n8. N-L: What image do you<br />\nthink the Homewood community has of the Coalition?<br />\n<br />\nGenest said that the community has a \"misunderstanding of<br />\nwhat we're trying to achieve and<br />\nwhy we use certain means to<br />\nachieve our aims. A lot of people seem to object to the amount<br />\nof media coverage we get, but our<br />\nhope is to get a certain perspective expressed to the various communities served by those media.<br />\n\"A lot of people have strong<br />\nfeelings for and against what we<br />\ndo,\" he continued, but we<br />\nthink on the whole that people<br />\ntake this action as an improvement over the previous politically moribund era at Hopkins.\"<br />\n9. N-L: Is the Coalition<br />\nsatisfied with its image within<br />\nthe Homewood community?<br />\n\"Not entirely,\u2014 said Bond.<br />\n\"Our actions have been so controversial on campus that some<br />\nfew people haven't taken the time<br />\nto judge our work in the<br />\nBaltimore community as a whole.<br />\nCriticism of our approach may be<br />\nlargely unwarranted.<br />\nHe also contended that \"by and<br />\nlarge, we've done more in the last<br />\nfifteen months in the way of<br />\nserious activism than anyone<br />\nthought this campus could<br />\nsupport.\"<br />\n10. N-L: Are you pleased at<br />\nthe type of opposition that has<br />\narisen recently against the<br />\nCoalition?<br />\n\"I personally consider the main<br />\nopposition to be the intransigent<br />\nattitude of the Trustees,\" he said.<br />\n\"The College Republicans are<br />\nmerely a diversion. We hope in<br />\nthe future they try to be more<br />\naccurate.\"<br />\n<br />\n\fUniversity Revises<br />\nIncompletes Policy<br />\nTo Tighten Process<br />\n1.\\l. ksta<br />\nIn an effort to check what Martha Roseman. associate dean of<br />\nacademic advising. called a<br />\n\"looser and looser \u2014 interpretation of incompletes. a new incompletes policy has been instituted effective this semester.<br />\nThe move was made for<br />\n\"documenting incompletes better. \u2014 said Roseman. who<br />\nestimates the total number of incompletes per semester to be in<br />\nthe hundreds. Roseman also added that the new process will be<br />\nmore fair to the student who<br />\nbreaks their neck to get things in<br />\non time...<br />\nThe new incomplete process<br />\nrequires the student to pick up a<br />\nfive-part form, Resolution of Incomplete. which is similar to an<br />\nadd/drop slip, from Academic<br />\n, Advising and Counseling. These<br />\nforms can be accessed freely and<br />\ndo not require any meeting with<br />\nAdvising and Counseling. The<br />\nstudent then takes the form to the<br />\nprofessor when requesting an<br />\nincomplete..<br />\nBoth the reason for requesting<br />\nthe incomplete and a description<br />\nof the work to be completed are<br />\nrequired by the form. Roseman<br />\ndescribed this documentation as<br />\na \"contract for resolving the incomplete.\" The student and the<br />\ninstructor both keep one copy<br />\neach, and the instructor then<br />\nstaples the remaining three copies<br />\nto the grade roster. The registrar<br />\nthen keeps one copy and<br />\ndistributes the last two copies to<br />\nAcademic Advising and Counseling and to the student's advisor.<br />\nA deadline for completion of<br />\n, the incomplete work is also requested by the form. The old<br />\ndeadline of submission of one<br />\nmonth into the following semester<br />\nwill still hold. The professor<br />\nmay, however, assign a deadline \u2022<br />\nprior to one month into the<br />\nsemester, but not after.<br />\nRoseman said, \"it's a good<br />\nidea to have the incomplete,\" but<br />\nthere had been rumblings about<br />\nthe informal way they were<br />\n<br />\ndocumented and handled. Important decisions such as evaluating<br />\na student's status, determining<br />\nprobation assignments. and clearing graduations were held up, not<br />\nknowing the nature of the<br />\nincomplete.<br />\nA subcommittee of the Committee of Undergraduate Studies<br />\nwas formed to address the handling of incompletes at Hopkins.<br />\nStudent representatives on the<br />\nCUS then unanimously approved<br />\nthe new policy.<br />\nRoseman said the new policy<br />\n'may discourage incompletes.<br />\nThe original spirit of the incomplete. she said, was for extenuating circumstances.\u2014 and<br />\nthat they \"should not have been<br />\ngiven loosely.\u2014<br />\n<br />\nCampus Crime Report<br />\nBREAKING & ENTERING<br />\n*The complainant reported that<br />\nsometime between 3 and 5 a.m.<br />\nMarch 23, someone gained entrance to 3505 N.

After reviewing the debate which dominated last<br />\nWednesday's meeting, we couldn't help<br />\nrecalling our twenty-eight year old article and wondering if such a move<br />\nmight not cause an improvement in the<br />\nquality of our student government<br />\ntoday.<br />\nThis week, the item which elicited the<br />\nmost discussion at Council was, once<br />\nagain, the upper quad rally and counterprotest held by the Coalition for a Free<br />\nSouth Africa and the College<br />\nRepublicans on March 18. Specifically, debate centered on the scuffle which<br />\nbroke out between Scott David Lippe<br />\nand a non-student pro-Coalition protester. At its last meeting before Spring<br />\nBreak, Council analyzed the scuffle in<br />\ndetail. This week, Council re-analyzed<br />\nits earlier analyses. No conclusions<br />\nwere made.<br />\nIf by now you've lost track of the<br />\noriginal incident and its \"important\"<br />\npolitical repercussions, you're not<br />\nalone. For the life of us, we're having<br />\ntrouble following Council's seemingly<br />\naimless discussions on the topic\u2014yet we<br />\n..seem to be right in the thick of it all.<br />\n<br />\n(Council members spent a large portion<br />\nof their most recent deliberations<br />\ndiscussing the role the News-Letter<br />\nplayed in covering the absurdly protracted debates.)<br />\nFor the record, we stand by the accuracy of our earlier reports on the scuffle scandal, specifically our account<br />\nprinted on April 3.<br />\nAlso for the record, we believe the<br />\nentire issue is patently ridiculous.<br />\nWhatever the cause of the original<br />\nscuffle, one thing is sure\u2014it's none of<br />\nCouncil's business. Fights which break<br />\nout on campus, depending on the circumstances, ought to be resolved by existing institutions equipped to handle<br />\nthem, like Campus Security, the Office<br />\nof the Dean of Students, or the<br />\nBaltimore City Police Department.<br />\nSurely, there are more pressing matters for Council to address in the final<br />\ndays of the 1986-87 academic year than<br />\nthe petty problems of attention-seeking<br />\nprotesters. By casting itself into the<br />\npseudo-judicial role of censurer (or<br />\npotential censurer) Council has only attempted to usurp the legitimate authority<br />\nof other more appropriate institutions.<br />\nIn the last weeks of the year, we hope<br />\nCouncil will return to tackle some of the<br />\nimportant issues it has raised in recent<br />\nweeks and allow the issue of the scuffle to rest.<br />\n<br />\nLetters<br />\nNo<br />\nTo the Editor:<br />\nIn response to your question of<br />\nlast week: no.<br />\nLove,<br />\nDave Shade<br />\nChairman, SAC Erecutive Board<br />\n<br />\nA Straight Head<br />\nTo the Editor:<br />\nCongratulations to our newly<br />\nelected Student Council officers.<br />\nNow that the fanfare surrounding<br />\nthe elections is spent, perhaps we<br />\ncan address a serious problem<br />\nwhich has dogged the Council for<br />\nnearly a year.

I have personally seen<br />\nthese displays and have been told<br />\nabout them by other Council<br />\nmembers.<br />\nSuch blatant disregard of form<br />\nand duty is pathetic. President<br />\nMark Komisky and all the other<br />\nCouncil members involved belittle their respective positions incredibly by overlooking such obvious irresponsibility.

Isn't it about<br />\ntime that someone took Student<br />\nCouncil on this campus seriously?<br />\n<br />\nRecently all undergraduates<br />\nreceived a sternly worded note<br />\nfrom the Office of Academic Advising about Incompletes. We<br />\nwere informed that the Committee for Undergraduate Studies had<br />\nevidence of flagrant abuses of the<br />\nsystem by students. Tough new<br />\nmeasures intended to curb the use<br />\nof extensions are to be implemented this semester. These<br />\ninclude a stringent formal definition of the Incomplete as an extension on the due date for work<br />\ngranted because of problems<br />\nbeyond the student's control, a<br />\nformal deadline by which the In-<br />\n<br />\nand was less likely to turn in first<br />\nclass work. The argument holds<br />\nas long as it assumed that the two<br />\nstudents are taking similar class<br />\nloads.<br />\nThe Committee should<br />\nrecognize that most of the use,<br />\nand the abuse, of the Incompletq<br />\ngrade hhs come from students in<br />\nthe Humanities and Social<br />\nScience courses. Since grading in<br />\nthese areas is based on the quality of pages written in relation to<br />\nthe number of pages read, two<br />\nquestions seem relevant to<br />\ngrading practices in these areas:<br />\nIs there really a standard amount<br />\n<br />\nrich bigelow<br />\ncomplete is to be resolved, and a<br />\nwritten justification for the In-'<br />\ncomplete filled out in quintuplet<br />\nand sent to the Registrar,<br />\nAcademic Advising, the student's<br />\nfaculty advisor, and the professor<br />\nwho granted the Incomplete.<br />\nThese efforts to curtail the<br />\nabuse of an academic loophole<br />\nare admirable. The setting of absolute due dates for Incompletes<br />\nwill reform a particularly unwarranted grading practice here: I am<br />\naware of one student who resolved an Incomplete three and a half<br />\nyears after it was granted.<br />\nPresumably this will no longer be<br />\npossible. There are reasons why<br />\nthe Incomplete has become as<br />\nubiquitous as it is, however.<br />\nGuidelines restricting the use of<br />\nextensions go a certain distance in<br />\naddressing the symptoms of an<br />\nacademic problem here, but not<br />\nfar enough to eliminate its source.<br />\non<br />\nCommittee<br />\nThe<br />\nUndergraduate Studies justifies<br />\nthe tightening of the requirements<br />\nfor excuses by pointing out the injustice of someone receiving the<br />\nsame, or better, grade for a<br />\ncourse as another who turned in<br />\nthe work on time. The latter student worked under more pressure<br />\n<br />\nof work expected from the student taking 12 to 21 credits, and<br />\nhow is it apportioned? Given the<br />\nprobability of better written work<br />\nproduced by a student with more<br />\ntime or a lighter workload, how<br />\nmuch of a grade should be based<br />\non the student's fulfillment of the<br />\nterms of the syllabus and how<br />\nmuch on the actual quality of the<br />\nwritten work?<br />\nThe requirements for grading<br />\nin many courses, particularly upper level Humanities seminars,<br />\nvary enormously. The grade I<br />\nreceived for a social theory<br />\ncourse in which there was no<br />\nwritten work appears to be worth<br />\nthe same three credits on my<br />\ntranscript as that for an historical<br />\nmethods course for which I produced fifty pages of well researched material. The standard three<br />\ncredits for a course may make<br />\nbookkeeping easier for the<br />\nRegistrar, but it distorts the actual workload a student may<br />\ncarry.

It was my destiny. . . to<br />\ntake his place. Tom in town.<br />\nIt was my first day at Hopkins.<br />\nA relative newcomer by any standards, I felt like an old hand<br />\nalready. Maybe that was because<br />\nthere already was a Tom<br />\nMcNamara enrolled on the<br />\nBaltimore campus. He was a<br />\nfake. I knew very well that I was<br />\nthe real Tom McNamara and this<br />\nwas my first day: April 8. By<br />\nnoon I found the crumbled remains of the once-proud Shanty<br />\nvillage on the Hopkins mall. I<br />\nwandered through the zoo of<br />\nsculptured animals in the flower<br />\ngarden near where Ike's brother<br />\nonce ruled proud over the<br />\nUniversity. Impressive. Real<br />\nnice.<br />\nYou may be wondering, and<br />\nrightly so, what I was doing here<br />\nat Hopkins in the first place. I was<br />\n,on an East Coast odyssey. A guy<br />\nfrom Minnesota (It's a state near<br />\nMinneapolis) out to see the<br />\nworld. The previous week had<br />\ntaken me through Boston, New<br />\nYork, New<br />\nHaven and<br />\nWashington. After much wandering I finally arrived in the geomagnetic center of the whole East<br />\nCoast complex. Baltimore. There<br />\nwere seals here, and plenty of<br />\nthem. There was even a big fat<br />\none who wouldn't go in the water<br />\nno matter how much we pleaded<br />\nwith him. I could see his reasoning. A big warship docked nearby, anything could happen. The<br />\nharbour was exciting but real<br />\ndangerous. I walked around<br />\nanyway, in mixed company of<br />\ncourse.<br />\nWe switched gears and decided to experience the seamier side<br />\nof Baltimore. Even Minnesotans<br />\nhad heard stories about the The<br />\nHorse You Came In On Bar. It<br />\nwas famous. There were lots of<br />\nrough and ready sailors down<br />\nthere. A real tough lot of sea<br />\nsalts. It was dangerous, real<br />\ndangerous. We went in anyway.<br />\nSome tough, bearded sailor was<br />\nsinging old Men At Work tunes.<br />\nSailors like that kind of stuff.<br />\nThere was even free popcorn.<br />\n.Simply unbelievable. People in<br />\n<br />\nBaltimore really live the high life.<br />\nIt was back to Hopkins and that<br />\ndynamic social center on Charles:<br />\nPls. There were pillars of<br />\nacademia everywhere. Lots of<br />\ndiscussions on chromosomes and<br />\nneuron receptors. Those Hoppies<br />\nwere smart, real smart. I didn't<br />\nstand a chance. I resolved to attend a biological engineering<br />\ncourse the next day to make up<br />\nfor lost time. And for pleasure of<br />\ncourse.<br />\nI didn't make it to class the next<br />\nmorning but I did have a good<br />\nreason. I sort of wanted to sleep<br />\nsome more, besides I wasn't<br />\nenrolled anyways. They can't<br />\ndock you letter points when<br />\nyou're not supposed to be there,<br />\nnot even at Hopkins. I felt pretty<br />\nguilty anyway. I decided to make<br />\nup for it by touring the campus<br />\nvery intensely.<br />\nIt was an amzaing place for a<br />\nguy from the Mid-West. After all<br />\nthis was the city that claimed the<br />\nbirthplace of Betsy Ross. It was<br />\nvery colonial. Hopkins was once<br />\na farm and it showed. Charles<br />\nCarroll's barn was now a<br />\nprestigious drama center. From<br />\nhay-filled horse stalls to contemporary theatre; there was nothing<br />\nthese Hoppies didn't think of.<br />\nOne could only wonder what<br />\nwould happen to the old Ham<br />\nRadio building. A hockey rink or<br />\na hospital, the possibilities were<br />\nendless here at Hopkins. Gilman<br />\nHall was home to a quaint cafe,<br />\na Post Office which mailed letters<br />\nall over the known world and a<br />\nplethora of financial institutions.<br />\nIt was a multi-purpose kind of<br />\nplace.<br />\nThe afternoon found Blue Jays<br />\nall over campus playing ball with<br />\nfunny little netted sticks. It looked fun, maybe just a little too fun.<br />\nI decided on a little racquetball instead. Some of these Hoppies<br />\nwere really athletic types. I decided to lose on purpose and blame<br />\nthose funny squash courts.<br />\nThe day was drawing to a<br />\nclose. It was my first day at the<br />\nbig JHU. I retired to a typewriter<br />\nat the old Gatehouse now housing the Hopkins News-Letter.<br />\nLots of history there.

A significant percentage of the graduate students in<br />\nthe Department of Political<br />\nScience signed their petition. The<br />\none<br />\namong<br />\ncirculated<br />\nundergraduates collected 308<br />\nsignatures, of which over 220<br />\nwere those of Political Science or<br />\nInternational Studies majors.<br />\nThough the quantity of Lettersto-the-Editor has diminished, the<br />\nconcern has not. Unfortunately,<br />\nwe have yet to hear any response<br />\nfrom the Academic Council. Of<br />\ncourse, there have been rumors<br />\nthat the decision is being reconsidered and should be finalized<br />\n\"very soon.\"<br />\nI appreciate the fact that this<br />\nwill be a weighty decision since<br />\nit will affect Dr. David, the<br />\nPolitical Science Department, Dr.<br />\nDavid's advisees, his students,<br />\nmany graduate students who plan<br />\nto take their comprehensive exams in the near future, and all of<br />\nthe Political Science and International Studies majors. Also, the<br />\nrepercussions will be felt in the<br />\nIS program in the years to come.<br />\nThe futures of over 300<br />\nundergraduates alone will be<br />\ntouched. Furthermore, a much<br />\nlarger question has been raised<br />\nwithin the Hopkins undergraduate<br />\ncommunity: \"How much attention does, and will, the<br />\nundergraduate education at<br />\nHopkins receive?\" Is our educa-<br />\n<br />\ntion being compromised as<br />\nHopkins returns to the ranks of<br />\nthose \"fine research institutions\"<br />\nwith little to offer to its<br />\nundergraduates?<br />\nIndeed, this decision will be an<br />\nimportant one and should be well<br />\nconsidered. But, speaking of consideration, is it not time to show<br />\nsome to Dr. David? It is already<br />\nlate in the year and every passing day is one more day for his<br />\nfuture at Hopkins to remain in<br />\nlimbo. Even now it is questionable whether Dr. David<br />\nwould stay if re-offered his post<br />\nwith promotion\u2014after all, he<br />\nmust consider his own future.<br />\nFurther delay can only decrease<br />\nthe possibility.<br />\nIt is time for the Academic<br />\nCouncil to offer some response to<br />\nthe appeal of so many concerned<br />\nstudents. It seems that the administrators have become so accustomed to protest \"Coalitionstyle\", that they are immune to<br />\nanything else. Maybe we should<br />\nconsider moving into Merryman<br />\n<br />\nHall and renaming it. . .<br />\nDepti Kharod<br />\n<br />\nAbove the Law<br />\nTo the Editor:<br />\nAs we all know, the freedom of<br />\nexpression has been threatened on<br />\nthis campus recently. The threat<br />\ntakes two forms. Firstly, this<br />\nfreedom has been obstructed and<br />\nviolated by the ripping down and<br />\ndefacement of posters on campus.<br />\nSecondly, this freedom has been<br />\nabused by a disregard for rules<br />\nand laws which limit free<br />\nexpression.<br />\nThe first threat has been felt by<br />\ncampus political groups on both<br />\nsides of the spectrum. As a College Republican I have experienced the effects of this vandalism<br />\nfirst-hand. The CRs often have to<br />\nposter campus bulletin boards<br />\nseveral times a day. The results<br />\nof this vandalism are losses in<br />\ntime, effort and money. In addi-<br />\n<br />\ntion, recently an off-campus<br />\ngroup called BERN wrote insulting remarks on one of our<br />\nposters, of which photocopies<br />\nwere made. The copies were<br />\nplaced on bulletin boards.<br />\nWe sympathize with the<br />\nHopkins Latin American Action<br />\nCommittee, which had its posters<br />\nsimilarly defaced. Contrary to<br />\nBob Baer's insinuations, the College Republicans were not<br />\nresponsible for this act. I have<br />\nbeen to every CR meeting, and<br />\nknow that there was never any<br />\nserious mention of buying a<br />\nstamp. The \"order form\" Baer<br />\nmentions advertised many items.<br />\nThese items reflected an ideology<br />\nextremely far to the right; hence<br />\nwe found them absurdly funny,<br />\nand joked about all of them.<br />\nThat's all the information I have,<br />\nand I submit it freely. Baer and<br />\nhis group need not selfrighteously \"insist\" that information be given. His presumptuous<br />\ntone and libelous accusations<br />\nwere certainly uncalled for.<br />\n<br />\nThis leads us to the second<br />\nform of violation of the freedom<br />\nof expression. Self-righteousness<br />\ncan foster the belief that one is<br />\nabove laws and rules. Obviously<br />\nsome anti-CIA activists hold this<br />\nattitude; they violated postering<br />\npolicy (Cmon guys -- posters on<br />\ntrees?) and one BERN member<br />\neven assaulted someone. I<br />\nassume, at least I hope, that<br />\nBERN members and other nonstudents were the only ones that<br />\nshowed such flagrant disregard<br />\nfor this University and those who<br />\nbelong in it. Since a good percentage of the demonstrators were<br />\nnon-students, this is quite probable. Since I do not know of<br />\nanyone else affiliated with these<br />\npeople, I must ask the Hopkins<br />\nLatin American Action Group to<br />\ntell these people how people are<br />\nexpected to conduct themselves<br />\non this campus. As I think most<br />\nHopkins students already know,<br />\nour freedom of expression is<br />\nContinued on Page 11<br />\n<br />\nby Loren Fox<br />\n<br />\nLast Night<br />\nLAST \\NEU\\ MY ToASTIR ibRoKE.<br />\n1T viouLDN'T Pt(' -THE 'RAD QP.<br />\n<br />\nmg. plus5E3AuriV5 1-N/<br />\noKtN VT Co1/431.1). ortvi PicK<br />\nbR:<br />\nAki7 INgatuTIOLAN ?U:LIC ITIEVISIoN.<br />\ntkEXT DooR,<br />\n'AS<br />\n<br />\n1 5ikooK -ME ToAsTEIR, WIT 1T WI<br />\nTHRE.v4 -TAE 'DAMN .N1 r4 C. or4 -THE<br />\nSANK<br />\nB-\u00b0012\u2022\u2022 MR.

Firstly, Mr. Genest 'advises' the College Republicans<br />\nthat their signs \"make people giggle and even snicker,\" and that<br />\nit is better to be taken seriously.<br />\nI find this statement very<br />\nhumorous coming from Mr.<br />\nGenest, whose group, the Coalition, staged a 'protest' in which<br />\nthree people with the letters C, I,<br />\nand A across their chests pranced across the stage and performed slapstick on the steps of<br />\nGilman. Some protest, Mr.<br />\nGenest! This is just one example<br />\nof the Coalition's hypocrisy and<br />\nbetween<br />\ndouble standard<br />\nthemselves and the rest of the<br />\nHomewood community.<br />\nMr. Finnerty also uses this<br />\ndouble standard. He says that<br />\nScott Lippe \"Needlessly provokeldi another member of the<br />\nanti-CIA group.\" What Mr.<br />\nLippe did was simply what the<br />\nCoalition has attempted to do<br />\nmany times themselves. Along<br />\nwith the College Republican<br />\ncounter-protesters, Mr. Lippe<br />\nverbally attempted to disrupt the<br />\nCoalition protest with a<br />\nmegaphone.<br />\nHasn't the Coalition verbally<br />\nand physically disrupted the campus with shanties, Mandela Hall,<br />\netc., all in the name of freedom<br />\nof expression? In any case, Mr.<br />\nLippe's verbal \"provocation,\" as<br />\nMr. Finnerty calls it, should have<br />\nbeen countered with a verbal<br />\nresponse. However, a protester<br />\njumped Lippe, broke his<br />\nmegaphone, and had to be pulled<br />\noff of Lippe. This assault was<br />\nmagnified by two facts: (1) This<br />\nattacker was in no way affiliated<br />\nwith the University, and (2)Campus security refused to remove<br />\nthis person from the protest.<br />\nSecurity claimed that the removal<br />\nof the protester would cause more<br />\nof a disturbance. I fail to understand how a security staff so<br />\ndiligent in handing out parking<br />\ntickets does not see just cause in<br />\nremoving an attacker from<br />\ncampus.<br />\nI do not deny the rights to<br />\nfreedom of expression on this<br />\ncampus, but it is a sad state of affairs when any derelict protesting<br />\non campus can assault a student<br />\nand get away with it. I suggest<br />\nthat if the Coalition would like to<br />\nprotest with their radical, derelict<br />\ncomrades, they should do so off<br />\ncampus, where assaults such as<br />\nthe one that occurred on March<br />\n16 would be met with immediate<br />\npolice action and not apathy.<br />\nThanks. to the Hopkins NewsLitter for printing Mr. Finnerty's<br />\nand Mr. Genest's letters in the<br />\nApril Fool's edition.<br />\nMichael Farbowitz<br />\n<br />\nIncomplete Policy: Jeopardizing Trust<br />\nContinued from Page 8<br />\nreceived the amount of credit he<br />\nor she deserved for a course, based on an objective standard of the<br />\namount of reading or writing<br />\nwhich actually constitutes one<br />\ncredit, a number of the people<br />\nwho rely on Incompletes would<br />\nonly be taking three or four<br />\ncourses apiece. The number of<br />\nIncompletes awarded each<br />\nsemester would decrease, and the<br />\nquality of writing produced in upper level courses would probably<br />\nimprove. It would also have the<br />\neffect of equalizing grading standards in the numerous upper diviwhich<br />\nin<br />\ncourses<br />\nsion<br />\nundergraduates compete with<br />\ngraduate students.<br />\n<br />\nThe letter from Academic Advising left the impression that Incompletes were exploited as a<br />\nmeans to shirk the various<br />\npressures that all students are expected to bear, and that their virtual elimination will insure<br />\nfairness, even if it jeopardizes the<br />\nquality of the writing produced at<br />\nthe school. My experience has<br />\nbeen that Incompletes serve as<br />\none of the only tools at the student's disposal to achieve a<br />\nreasonable workload at a school<br />\nwhere grading standards vary.<br />\nThe idea that anything which<br />\nendangers the quality of work<br />\nproduced here is beneficial to the<br />\nstudents is positively perverse. A<br />\nstudent in an upper level<br />\nHumanities course is looking not<br />\n<br />\njust for a grade, but for constructive criticism of his or her<br />\nwriting, and for recommendations for graduate schools. It is in<br />\nthe interest of that student to take<br />\nthe most challenging courses in<br />\nhis or her area of interest, and<br />\nthereby seek the recommendations which carry the most<br />\nweight. So long as these courses<br />\nare awarded the same credit as<br />\nlower division classes, that student runs the risk of producing<br />\nsubstandard work in a limited<br />\ntimeframe, or of relying on Incompletes. Neither of these options is productive.<br />\nAs a senior, I have had many<br />\npositive learning experiences here<br />\nat Hopkins. Most of these grew<br />\nout of a sense of trust between my<br />\n<br />\nprofessors and myself. Critical<br />\nthought and personal growth can<br />\nonly occur in an atmosphere in<br />\nwhich trust is an explicit condition of interaction. When an administration, or any authority<br />\nwhich is not directly involved in<br />\nthe learning process, interposes<br />\nitself between the professor and<br />\nthe student, it jeopardizes this<br />\nsense of trust. The stagnation of<br />\nthe academic enterprise itself<br />\nbecomes possible, and it would be<br />\nan egregious error for this school<br />\nto allow that condition to develop.<br />\nThe restriction of the use of Incompletes deters students from<br />\nabusing<br />\ntheir<br />\nacademic<br />\nprivileges.

Its development<br />\nsince has been rapid and apparently successful; last year the<br />\nbook sold out. Recently<br />\nHullabaloo has sent representatives to the Columbia Scholastic<br />\nPress Association's College Journalism Convention, discussing<br />\nideas and seeing samples of yearbooks from across the country.<br />\nOne important result of these trips<br />\nhas been the increased use of the<br />\ncomputer to help with layout and<br />\ngraphics. However, the biggest<br />\nchange in the book over the past<br />\nfew years has been the use of<br />\nmore copy.<br />\nThe biggest difference is in<br />\norganization. Staff size has doubled in the last four years; most experienced members stay on and<br />\nlots of new ones come in. Copy<br />\nnow has a separate staff, instead<br />\nof being the responsibility of the<br />\nlayout group. The four staffs,<br />\nbusiness, copy, layout, and<br />\nphotography, include about 70<br />\npeople, one of the largest groups<br />\never, and, according to Boyer and<br />\nPardo, one of the most dedicated.<br />\n\"It's a time-intensive job, but<br />\nthey do it. We say there's a<br />\n<br />\nmeeting, and they'll be there.<br />\nThey know we put a lot of effort<br />\ninto the book, and they are willing to do the same.\"<br />\nThe staff's dedication can be<br />\ntraced at least in part to the<br />\neditor's skill at pulling people<br />\ntogether. There are meetings<br />\nevery week throughout the first<br />\nsemester, besides a party in the<br />\nfall, a weekly staff newsletter, a<br />\nBIA team which has never<br />\nforfeited a game, late-night layout<br />\nsessions, a picnic in the spring,<br />\nand finally an end-of-year party<br />\nwhen the book actually comes<br />\nout.<br />\nThere are frequent editorial<br />\nmeetings as well, providing<br />\norganization and an opportunity<br />\nfor different staffs to exchange<br />\nideas.<br />\nThe four staffs are not entirely<br />\nseparate, as there are several people on more than one. Jordan<br />\nLevy and Rob Arnold work on<br />\nphotography and layout. \"Their<br />\nexperience with layout makes<br />\nat<br />\ngood<br />\nreally<br />\nthem<br />\nphotography,\" commented<br />\nBoyer. \"They know what works<br />\nwell.\" Dave Cheng is a member<br />\nof the layout staff who also does<br />\nproofs. \"He's invaluable,\" says<br />\nPardo. \"He insisted he couldn't<br />\nwrite, but he does proofs like you<br />\nwouldn't believe!\" Also invaluable, attests Boyer, is Mandy Busch, responsible for \"a<br />\nthird of the Senior Section, and<br />\nfor keeping everyone sane at<br />\ntimes,\" he said.<br />\nStaff members are proud of<br />\ntheir work.

The<br />\nHullabaloo provides it; since the<br />\nbook goes to print in January and<br />\ncannot include the spring<br />\nsemester, a spring supplement is<br />\nput out by the staff for the next<br />\nyear. Next year's editor-in-chief,<br />\nStephen M. Hewitt, was<br />\nphotography editor this year. He<br />\nand his staff will have a \"warmup\" with the supplement this<br />\nspring.<br />\nThere is no yearbook advisor.<br />\nThis gives the staff great freedom<br />\nand great responsibility, both of<br />\nwhich are being used to advantage this year, according to<br />\nBoyer.<br />\nThe layout has been completely revised. Spot color, or a colored background to a full-color<br />\npicture, has been added. The<br />\n1987 Hullabaloo will also be the<br />\nfirst to have an index (thank Qod<br />\nfor computers and people to do<br />\nthe work!) The only thing the<br />\nstaff is not pleased with is the portraits. \"We get the freshmen at<br />\nRegistration, and most of the<br />\nseniors come, but we're lucky to<br />\nget 500 total from the<br />\nsophomores and juniors.

Ivey<br />\n<br />\nReaping The Whirlwind is an<br />\nin-depth study of race relations in<br />\nMacon County, Alabama. Spanning more than a century, it takes<br />\nthe reader from Reconstruction<br />\ninto the early 1980's, and places<br />\nthe civil rights movement of the<br />\n1960's in a much larger historical<br />\ncontext. There, the author<br />\nfocuses on two struggles in particular: voting rights and school<br />\ndesegregation. Through local<br />\ndocuments and detailed interviews, Norell brings the racial<br />\nconflict down to the level of the<br />\nindividual, each with his own<br />\nfears and ambitions. Men such as<br />\nBooker T. Washington and<br />\nGeorge Wallace lose their largerthan-life aura in Norell's hands<br />\nand become both understandable<br />\nand approachable on a human<br />\nlevel.<br />\nThere is a value to this work<br />\nwhich goes beyond the history of<br />\nMacon County. The struggle<br />\nNorell details is a strange one: it<br />\n\u2022 is economic and political and at<br />\nthe same time it is neither. Such<br />\nis the nature of racial conflict. It<br />\nis not enough to say that blacks<br />\nare a politically, economically,<br />\nand educationally disadvantaged<br />\ngroup, and that by isolating and<br />\naddressing these issues their problems will dissipate. There is a<br />\ndistinct and unavoidable disadvantage to being in the black<br />\nminority in this country, which<br />\ncan only be discussed in the context of racism. This is the<br />\nmessage that Norell, perhaps unconsciously, most clearly states.<br />\nThe blacks of Macon County<br />\nwere denied their rights in this<br />\nsociety because they were black,<br />\nand for no other reason. This is<br />\nthe reason why this book and<br />\nothers like it have a fundamental<br />\nimportance.<br />\nIn 1987 many would like to<br />\nbelieve that slavery was long ago,<br />\nthat racism has been all but<br />\neradicated, that in fact the civil<br />\nrights movement of the 1960's<br />\nplaced blacks on an equal footing<br />\nwith the majority, eliminating<br />\nrace as a factor to success. Norell<br />\nreminds us that this is simply not<br />\nthe case. Consider the case of<br />\nJohn Battle, Governor of<br />\nAlabama until 1962.\"'My constant companion during my<br />\nboyhood days,' Battle told the<br />\nAlabama officials, 'was Cullen<br />\nA. Battle, the Confederate<br />\nGeneral who in 1870 led Macon<br />\nCounty conservatives in their<br />\nviolent retrieval of political power<br />\nfrom James Alston and the black<br />\nrepublicans . . . None of you<br />\nwhite citizens and officials of<br />\nAlabama believe more strongly<br />\nthan I do in the segregation of the<br />\nraces as the right and proper way<br />\nof life in the South.'\" Keep in<br />\nmind that confederate generals<br />\nwere slave owners, and that Battle's euphemism, \"violent<br />\nretrieval,\" was realized as<br />\nbeatings, arson and murder<br />\nagainst elected black officials.<br />\nThen perhaps slavery and its<br />\neffects are not that far removed<br />\nfrom the present; but surely, the<br />\nignorance that breeds racism has<br />\nbeen eliminated. The author<br />\nrecalls that George Wallace succeeded Battle as governor of<br />\nAlabama. An infamous opponent<br />\n<br />\nof the civil rights movement, in<br />\nhis inaugural speech he declared,<br />\n\"In the name of the greatest people that have ever trod the earth<br />\n. . .1 say segregation now!<br />\nSegregation tomorrow! Segregation forever!\" George Wallace<br />\nwas governor of Alabama until<br />\nlast year; still extremely popular,<br />\nhe retired because of failing<br />\nhealth. Racism is alive and<br />\nflourishing. Recent violence in<br />\nNew York City reminds us that<br />\nthis is not just a Southern<br />\nproblem.<br />\nMoreover, in the 1980's,<br />\nblacks are, if anything, \"less<br />\nequal\" than during the fight for<br />\nequality. Norell comments on this<br />\nin his conclusion. \"Conservatives<br />\n<br />\nauthority as a result of the rapid<br />\nexpansion ot federal and state<br />\npower in the 1950's and 60's.<br />\nDecisions about education,<br />\nwelfare, criminal justice, and<br />\neducational development in<br />\nMacon County were more likely<br />\nto be made outside the county<br />\nthan within it. Poor blacks could<br />\nhardly influence those more<br />\nremote governments . . .Failures<br />\nof interracial cooperation were,<br />\nof course, also a legacy of<br />\nsegregation. Most citizens, black<br />\nand white, were simply unable to<br />\novercome in a few years the<br />\ngenerations of racial alienation<br />\nand hatred that Macon Countians<br />\nhad experienced.\"<br />\nToday this nation is faced with<br />\n<br />\ntoo painful lessons of the past. Attempting to move forward by<br />\nforgetting the past is the path of<br />\nfools. Works such as Reaping The<br />\nWhirlwind are an important<br />\nbeginning in the understanding of<br />\nrace relations.<br />\nWhy was Macon County<br />\nchosen for such a detailed work<br />\non racial conflict? With a population of about 8,000 by 1960<br />\nspread over three towns and huge<br />\nexpanses of farmland, it would<br />\nnot at first seem to be at the<br />\nforefront of anything. Yet there<br />\nare several important things to<br />\nconsider when looking at Macon<br />\nCounty. First, blacks had been in<br />\nthe majority since the beginning<br />\nof the 19th century. Second,<br />\nMacon is in Alabama, a key<br />\npower in the Confederate States<br />\nof America, and under the leadership of Gov. George Wallace, a<br />\nrelentless opponent of the federal<br />\ngovernment and the civil rights<br />\nmovement. To quote Norell,<br />\n\" . . Macon County can best be<br />\nunderstood in the context of<br />\nevolving white anxieties. In the<br />\n1850's many white Alabamians<br />\n\"Prwisely the kind of first-class study of a local segment<br />\nhad feared losing their inof the civil rights movement which illuminates the whole:.<br />\n-HARRISON F:SA MOURN'<br />\ndependence and autonomy. which<br />\nthey felt were being threatened by<br />\nabolitionism and northern opposition to slavery's expansion...Losing the war affirmed<br />\nfor many white southerners the<br />\nlegitimacy of their earlier fears.<br />\nThe subsequent uncertainty about<br />\nthe nature of the postwar society<br />\naggravated their fear, and Radical<br />\nReconstruction only exacerbated<br />\nanxieties that were firmly<br />\nembedded in the minds of<br />\nmany.\" Alabama was the heart of<br />\nSouthern conservatism. Third,<br />\nand most important, Tuskegee Institute, one of the first and finest<br />\nblack institutions for higher<br />\neducation was in the county seat,<br />\nTuskegee. Thus, both black and<br />\nwhite leadership were located in<br />\nthe same town.<br />\nNorell traces the relationship<br />\nbetween the leaders of both communities, as the blacks of Macon<br />\nCounty attempted to claim what<br />\nwas theirs under the Constitution,<br />\nwhile white conservatives resisted<br />\nthis effort to redistribute the<br />\npower. He opens with Cullen A.<br />\nBattle leading white conservatives<br />\nin removing the Reconstruction<br />\nblack politicians from the county<br />\nthrough violence and intimidation. A decade later, in 1881.<br />\nBooker T. Washington founds<br />\nTuskegee Institute, an attempt by<br />\nthe white community to secure<br />\ntheir power base by controlling<br />\nthe education of blacks.<br />\nWashington, however, had ideas<br />\nof his own, and the long, painfully slow struggle for equality in<br />\nMacon County began.<br />\nhad lost the hegemony they had the prospect of a population<br />\nLater, in the 1930's, George<br />\nfought so hard to maintain, and which will be over 50% non-white Gommillion, a young professor at<br />\nmany felt it necessary to leave the in 20 years, and a significant por- Tuskegee, emerged as the leader<br />\ncommunity rather than live under tion of that population will be of the black community.

NOR RELL<br />\n<br />\nsolute power of white conservatives. only a gradualist approach would have been<br />\nsuccessful.<br />\nNorell's treatment of the white<br />\ncommunity is perhaps the<br />\nstrongest part of the work. Unlike<br />\nthe black community, there was<br />\na myriad of white politicians,<br />\nbusinessmen, and prominent<br />\ncitizens opposed to the social<br />\nchanges being sought, and the<br />\nauthor includes almost all of<br />\nthem. Norell was skillfully able<br />\nto emphasize the most important<br />\nof them, such as Judge William<br />\nVarner, and Governors Battle and<br />\nWallace, without diminishing the<br />\ncontributions of the lesser<br />\ncharacters, or overwhelming the<br />\nreader with information. He has<br />\npossessed a keen understanding<br />\nof the southern white society,<br />\nperhaps because he is a white<br />\nsoutherner himself, and neither<br />\ncondemns nor defends the conservatives. These characters become<br />\nquite human and plausible in his<br />\nhands. There was also a small but<br />\nsignificant contingent of white<br />\nliberals who supported the social<br />\nchanges. Norell adds uncustomary depth to his treatment<br />\nof them by detailing the importance of their backgrounds to<br />\ntheir liberal views, and why they<br />\nwere disenfranchised under the<br />\nexisting power Structure.<br />\nThe book moves quickly<br />\nthrough the 1960's, focusing on<br />\nthe changes in the power structure<br />\nwithin the black community.<br />\nStudents, dissatisfied with the<br />\ngradualist approach and the<br />\ngrowing distance between the<br />\nblack middle and lower classes,<br />\nrapidly became the new,<br />\n\"grassroots\" leadership of the<br />\nblack community.

He<br />\nbrings together a century of<br />\nseemingly disjointed events into<br />\na unified and continuous history.<br />\nThe major weakness of<br />\nNorell's book is in his treatment<br />\nof the black leaders. While he<br />\ndiscusses them fairly, accurately,<br />\nand with considerable detail, they<br />\nnonetheless lack the depth and<br />\nhumanity of his white characters.<br />\nHe discusses blacks with a certain<br />\ndetachment, a distance not felt<br />\nwhen he deals with the white<br />\ncharacters. This may be a shortcoming of his research, cases<br />\nwhere black sources may not<br />\nhave been as open and frank with<br />\nhim as the white sources. Or<br />\nperhaps it is a reflection of the<br />\nmind of the author, who is<br />\nhimself a white southerner and<br />\nmay not understand the black segment of his long-segregated<br />\nsociety as well as he does the<br />\nwhite. In either case, the flaw is<br />\nsignificant but not disastrous.<br />\nReaping The Whirlwind is a<br />\ngood place to begin an understanding of the civil rights movement.<br />\nIt is a balanced, accurate, and important work. In addition, there<br />\nare several books available in the<br />\nlibrary on Tuskegee Institute,<br />\nSNCC.

According<br />\nto Linda Rhoades, adult nurse<br />\npractitioner at the Student Health<br />\nClinic, college students \"can get<br />\naway with poor diet/exercise<br />\nhabits.\u2014 For example, if they fall<br />\ninto a routine of doughnut/coffee<br />\nbreakfasts or no morning food at<br />\nall, they may just get a dragging<br />\nfeeling until lunchtime. However,<br />\nby the time they reach their thirties, \"the caffeine and poor diet<br />\nhabits can manifest themselves as<br />\nphysical ailments. . . such as<br />\nulcers.\"<br />\nFor everyone without special<br />\nmedical needs, Ms. Rhoades'<br />\ndietary advice is very simple: ample portions of the four basic food<br />\ngroups (meat [2 servings/dayl,<br />\nvegetables [4], grains [41, dairy<br />\n[4]) on a regular, daily schedule<br />\nto provide necessary vitamins and<br />\nminerals. And, she adds that<br />\ncaloric intake should be apportioned with 20%,30%, and 50%<br />\nfrom protein, carbohydrates, and<br />\nfat, respectively. Ms. Rhoades<br />\npoints out that vitamin pills are<br />\ninadequate substitutes for natural<br />\nsources which are\". . . better absorbed and metabolized by the<br />\nbody.\"<br />\nMs. Rhoades has observed that<br />\nmany Hopkins students follow inadequate and irregular diet plans<br />\nwhich can adversely affect their<br />\ndaily lives. She says the coffee<br />\nand doughnut breakfast \"is one of<br />\nthe worst ways to treat your body<br />\nin the morning.\" The \"sugar<br />\nhigh \u2014 is quickly followed by<br />\nhypoglycemia, an abnormal<br />\ndecrease in blood sugar which<br />\nrobs the body of energy. Alcohol,<br />\nshe adds, \"provides no vitamins<br />\nor minerals but is loaded with<br />\nempty calories.\"<br />\nIn time, an inadequate diet can<br />\nevidence itself in physical appearance and general attitude.<br />\nFor example, low iron intake<br />\ncauses anemia because fewer re0<br />\n<br />\nblood cells are available to carry<br />\noxygen; a person looks pale, gets<br />\nshort of breath when exercising,<br />\nand feels generally rundown. A<br />\ngood diet, insists Ms. Rhoades,<br />\nkeeps hair and skin healthy and<br />\nimproves mental acuity for an<br />\noverall feeling of well-being.<br />\nFor weight loss, Ms. Rhoades<br />\nadvises ignoring fad diets and<br />\nsticking rigidly by the regular<br />\nplan mentioned previously.<br />\n\"Weight loss comes with lower<br />\ncaloric intake . . .and exercise,\"<br />\nshe says, and adds that the Student Health Center can help<br />\nstudents plan a personal<br />\ndiet/calorie schedule according to<br />\ntheir personal histories. The<br />\nschedule's progress would be<br />\nmonitored every three weeks.<br />\nMs. Rhoades stresses that increased physical activity should<br />\nbe accompanied by eating more<br />\nnatural carbohydrates: grains,<br />\nfruits, and vegetables. These<br />\nfoods \"add more minerals to the<br />\nbody.. .to replace sodium and<br />\npotassium lost by sweating.\" She<br />\nexplains that losing these electrolytes \"can cause severe abdominal and leg cramps.\u2014 She<br />\nalso emphasizes that unlike carbohydrates, protein is not<br />\nmetabolized by the body during<br />\nexercise and that training tones<br />\nand builds muscle mass. As a<br />\nwarning, she points out that protein increases fluid intake, which<br />\nmay overload the kidneys, causing calcium loss.<br />\nLike a good diet, exercise provides many benefits for those who<br />\ntake time for it. Assistant athletic<br />\ntrainer Joanne McGurney has<br />\nbecome familiar with the exercising habits of Hopkins students<br />\nsince arriving here last January.<br />\nShe currently works in the<br />\nAthletic Center's Training Room<br />\nwhere she helps take care of intercollegiate athletes, providing<br />\ntaping or support equipment and<br />\nrehabilitation services for injured<br />\nathletes. Though the training<br />\nroom serves mostly intercollegiate athletes, it does administer emergency first-aid to<br />\nnon-athletes and takes on a few<br />\n<br />\nstudents referred from the Health<br />\nCenter.<br />\nAccording to Ms. McGurney,<br />\nthe most popular fitness activity<br />\nfor Hopkins students is jogging,<br />\nfollowed closely by swimming<br />\nand weight-lifting. She adds,<br />\n\"There are more females in<br />\nweight-lifting than before,\" and<br />\nthat weight programs for individuals are set up if desired.<br />\nMs. McGurney emphasizes the<br />\nimportance for everyone to participate in some sort of regular<br />\nexercise program. For those just<br />\nbeginning, she suggests an alternating jogging/walking program.<br />\n\"It's easy to keep jogging. . .once you start slowly,\"<br />\nshe explains and points out that<br />\noverweight individuals should be<br />\nespecially wary of overdoing it.<br />\nJogging, if done properly, isn't<br />\ndangerous. Ms. McGurney attributes the few injuries she sees,<br />\nfor example shin-splints and foot<br />\nproblems, to improper technique.<br />\nJogging should be done on<br />\ncushion-backed or grassy surfaces, as opposed to cement<br />\nwhere the shock from pounding<br />\ncannot be absorbed. For those<br />\nwho find running too rigorous,<br />\nMs. McGurney advises walking<br />\nas a nearly equal alternative.<br />\nPerhaps the best all-around<br />\nfitness sport is swimming. The<br />\nexercise loosens up muscles all<br />\nover the body, without causing<br />\nthe physical trauma (from pounding) that jogging may involve.<br />\nThe Athletic Center's Pool is<br />\nopen at various hours for general<br />\nuse: weekdays 7 a.m. to 9 a.m.,<br />\n11 a.m. to 4 p.m., and 6:30 p.m.<br />\nto 10 p.m.; Saturday 12:00 to 8<br />\np.m., and Sunday 1 p.m. to 8<br />\np.m. For those seeking more<br />\ncompetitive activity, many sports<br />\nsuch as tennis, racquetball and<br />\nbasketball are great for cardiovascular fitness.<br />\nMs. McGurney stresses that<br />\npeople should have a regular time<br />\nalloted in their schedules for<br />\nworking out. Those who despise<br />\nexercising now \"may find it<br />\nhabit-forming.\" As a personal<br />\nnote, she remarks, \"I used to<br />\n<br />\nIlene Jacobs<br />\n<br />\nIntercollegiate athletes to non-serious runners flock to the Hopkins track<br />\nfor a dail work out. The track around Homevmod Field is just part of<br />\nthe athletic facilities that Hopkins provides.<br />\n<br />\ndespise running, but now I feel<br />\nreally uncomfortable if I miss it.\"<br />\nCardio-vascular activities, such<br />\nas jogging 3 miles or swimming<br />\nan hour can be done daily; toning exercises like weight-lifting<br />\nor competitive sports where<br />\ntedium may develop are better on<br />\nan every-other-day basis. The<br />\nbest time to exercise is a while<br />\nafter eating, thereby increasing<br />\nmetabolism and burning off<br />\ncalories right away.<br />\nAn extremely important but<br />\noften overlooked benefit of exercising relates to mental wellbeing. Ms. McGurney points out<br />\nthat it is an effective stress<br />\nreliever because \"it diverts your<br />\nconcentration away from a<br />\n<br />\ntest. . .from worrying. Even<br />\nthough you may have to face studying again. . .exercising gives<br />\nyou a feeling of accomplishment.\" Self-improvement comes<br />\nfrom both building physically and<br />\nmentally.<br />\nThe best overall picture' of<br />\nwell-being involves a good diet<br />\nand regular exercise. Without exercise, the tone and size of a muscle declines, whereas a diet of<br />\nmilkshakes and burgers cannot be<br />\ncompensated for by rigorous exercise. Finally, consider time<br />\nspent preparing for a three-course<br />\nmeal and regular swimming or<br />\nracquetball an investment in mental sharpness as well.<br />\n<br />\nWomen in Science: They Can Make a Difference<br />\nby Ely Brown<br />\nScience and medicine for the<br />\nbetter part of history have been<br />\na man's realm, but now things are<br />\nbeginning to change. To what extent have women influenced<br />\nmedicine up until now? How can<br />\nthey alter it in the future? These<br />\nquestions and others were the<br />\nfocal point for the fourth lecture<br />\nin the series \"The Public Interest<br />\nin Science.\" Two female scientists were the main speakers for<br />\nthe evening: Elizabeth Fee of the<br />\nJohns Hopkins University School<br />\nof Hygiene and Public Health,<br />\nand Ruth Hubbard from Harvard<br />\nUniversity.<br />\nToday women do occupy positions in all levels of science, but<br />\nin the higher, more dominant stations it is the men who still<br />\ndominate. In the lab, women are<br />\nresearchers, technicians, and<br />\n<br />\nsecretaries, but rarely do they<br />\nhead the lab itself. In the medical<br />\nfield, many women have become<br />\nphysicians, but once again men<br />\nare in the majority. Fee pointed<br />\nout a very important factor concerning this inequality. In the<br />\nhealth care profession, women<br />\noccupy a majority of the positions<br />\navailable, even if they are not the<br />\npowerful ones. Dieticians,<br />\nnurses, right down to candy<br />\nstripers are often women, and<br />\nthese people are the ones who<br />\ndirectly care for the patient on a<br />\npersonal level. As Fee sees it, this<br />\nis a main problem for the medical<br />\nprofession. She believes that<br />\nphysicians, mostly men, \"know<br />\nabout the body,\" while the<br />\nothers, mostly women, \"care for<br />\nit.\" Medicine should not be split<br />\nbetween the two, but rather a<br />\ncombination of both.<br />\nThis is where women came in.<br />\n<br />\nFee cited one male physician who<br />\nbelieved that to improve medicine<br />\ntoday they would have to<br />\n\"change the sex and priorities of<br />\nthe system as a whole.\" \"Body<br />\nengineering\" is not the wave of<br />\nthe future in Fee's eyes. It is the<br />\ntreatment of the body and soul of<br />\nthe patient as one entity. Today<br />\nin general, women work fewer<br />\nhours, receive less pay, participate less in private practice,<br />\nare more involved with the patient and his needs, and basically<br />\nare open to the voice of the life<br />\nwork as opposed to that of<br />\nmedicine.\" These qualities are<br />\nwhat is needed to \"reintegrate the<br />\npatient into the medical encounter.\u2022'<br />\nWith more women in the<br />\nsystem, it would be possible to involve medicine more directly<br />\nwith social problems. For instance, rather than treating only<br />\n<br />\nthe injuries of a battered wife, it<br />\nwould help fight the cause of the<br />\nproblem, the violent husband.<br />\nTo Hubbard, more feminist<br />\nwomen in science would provide<br />\n\"a different way of looking at<br />\nnature.\" Because \"science is<br />\nknowledge about nature for use\"<br />\na new outlook on the world would<br />\nalter science. Hubbard, a feminist<br />\nherself, believes that women<br />\nwould use science for more<br />\nhumane purposes rather than for<br />\n\"profit, domination, or warfare.\u2014<br />\nShe pointed to the opinion that<br />\nmen are very objective while<br />\nwomen are more subjective.

They did not create<br />\ndifferent \"stories\" from the<br />\ndata, but rather elaborated on<br />\nthem. In Hubbard's point of<br />\nview, a similar one to Fee's,<br />\nwomen have the ability to look at<br />\na part and see how it relates to the<br />\nwhole.<br />\nIn conclusion, what Fee and<br />\nHubbard were stressing was that<br />\nwomen have a significant contribution to make to science and<br />\nmedicine. It may not be better<br />\nthat what exists today, but it is<br />\ndifferent and more encompassing.

The 13-10 victory put<br />\nJHU at the top of the West division of the Middle Atlantic<br />\nConference.<br />\nThe Lady Laxers began the<br />\nmatch unsure of themselves, as<br />\nthey were coming off of two<br />\nMAC defeats last week-a 7-14<br />\nloss to last year's MAC champions and NCAA quarterfinalists,<br />\nHaverford, and an agonizing<br />\n11-12 loss to Franklin and Marshall. The loss to Franklin and<br />\nMarshall had especially upset the<br />\nteam, for they lost the game in the<br />\nlast 90 seconds after having had<br />\na 6-1 lead in the first half.<br />\n<br />\nHowever, the Lady Jays came<br />\nthrough to triumph over Gettysburg in the most crucial MAC<br />\ngame on their schedule. Coaches<br />\nKatie Glose and Jeanette Ireland<br />\nagreed that the determining factor was \"teamwork all over the<br />\nfield.\"<br />\nThe Gettysburg victory was<br />\nimportant not only for team<br />\nmorale, but also for determining<br />\nwhether Hopkins will play in the<br />\nMAC Championship. If the Lady<br />\nJays can beat Western Maryland<br />\non April 14 and Dickinson on<br />\nApril 16, the two remaining<br />\nWestern division games left on<br />\ntheir schedule, Hopkins would<br />\nthen claim first place in their division and advance to the championship, held on Saturday, May<br />\n2. Head Coach Sally Anderson is<br />\nalso aiming for an invitation to<br />\nthe NCAA tournament, which is<br />\n<br />\npossible if Hopkins wins the rest<br />\nof their games.<br />\nAnderson credits the superior<br />\ngoalkeeping of Laura Porter and<br />\nJackie Fatula as one reason for<br />\nthe marked improvement in this<br />\nyear's team. (Last year's team<br />\nhad a humiliating 5-24 fall to Gettysburg.) Despite their relative inexperience in lacrosse, both<br />\ngoalkeepers are averaging 50 percent in saves, one of the many<br />\nstatistics up from last year. According to Coach Anderson,\"We<br />\nare much stronger than last year,<br />\nOn the field, Erika Feller has<br />\nbeen the fulcrum of the defense<br />\nat cover point. She has been very<br />\nconsistent and very strong. Kacie<br />\nWhite has also been a big asset to<br />\nthe defense. She plays a very persistent defensive wing.

He cited examples of how presidents have<br />\nviolated treaties to making covert<br />\narms sales,justifying their actions<br />\nto the American public by brandishing the threat of a \"red tide.\"<br />\nExamples of abuse of presidential power, he said, have ranged<br />\nfrom Watergate to the War,<br />\nPowers Act.

Originally formed in<br />\nJanuary, /986 in opposition to the<br />\nUniversity's refusal to divest from<br />\ncompanies doing business in South<br />\nAfrica, the Coalition now has a much<br />\nwider agenda, whose issues range<br />\nfrom banks' divestment, to housing<br />\nin Baltimore, to the Central Intelligence Agency's on-campus<br />\nrecruitment of students.<br />\n1. N-L: Where does the<br />\nCoalition stand now?<br />\nBond explained, \"We're<br />\nbroadening our concerns solely<br />\nfrom South African apartheid into two other issues. One concerns<br />\ndomestic apartheid and how<br />\nracism here can be combatted.<br />\nOur main immediate goals are to<br />\nhalt banks' discriminatory redlining practices.<br />\nHe said that the Coalition \"got<br />\na great victory on that from<br />\nMaryland National in November,<br />\nwith the help of other groups,\"<br />\nand is now addressing the issue<br />\nof housing with other banks.<br />\nThe second concern, he said,<br />\n\"is attacking other immoral U.S.<br />\nforeign policies.\"<br />\n2. N-L: What is the Coalition's purpose?<br />\n\"Initially, it was simply divestment,\u2014 said Bond. \"Now, we<br />\nwant divestment and more. In<br />\ngeneral terms, we want social<br />\nchange: and end to racism and<br />\neconomic injustice.\"<br />\n3. N-L: Is University divestment still a practical goal?<br />\n\"Very much so,\" replied<br />\nBond. \"We're considering the<br />\nlast divestment vote invalid,<br />\nbecause many Trustees were in<br />\nconflict of interest, and we're<br />\nconsidering other avenues to have<br />\nthis issue addressed.\"<br />\n4. N-L: Why has the Coalition expanded its horizons<br />\nbeyond the issue of divestment?<br />\nBond cited \"natural links\" in<br />\nthe Coalition's activities, citing<br />\nthe agreement with Maryland National Bank for the bank to provide $50 million in loans for<br /><br />\nArguably. the Coalition reached a<br />\npeak in late September and early<br />\nOctober, 1986, when it successfully<br />\nwon the University's approval to<br />\nbuild a protest shanty following the<br />\narrests of fourteen protesters surrounding an illegal, Coalition-built<br />\nshanty only three days earlier.<br />\nA month later, Coalition members<br />\nlay down in aisles to hinder Board of<br />\nTrustees members from leaving their<br />\nmeeting, and then disrupted the<br />\nsubsequent Trustees' news con-<br /><br />\nBaltimore's lower-income and<br />\nminority neighborhoods. \"It was<br />\nlogical for us to go then to<br />\nHopkins,\" said Bond, \"which<br />\nowns 140 houses in East<br />\nBaltimore, and try to put this<br />\nmoney to good use.\"<br />\nGenest focused on the anti-CIA<br />\non-campus recruitment protest,<br />\nsaying that the CIA has provided<br />\ninformation to South African<br />\nforces resisting African National<br />\nCongress activities. \"A further<br />\nlink,\" he added, \"is that covert<br />\nfunds are being provided to Jonas<br />\nSavimbi of UNITA,<br />\n\"a group he<br />\nsaid is trying to overthrow the<br />\nAngolan government with South<br /><br />\nPatrick Bond<br /><br />\nference. The Coalition then moved<br />\nto Garland Hall, which it renamed<br />\nMandela Hall, for a nine day sit-in in<br />\nwhich it demanded, but failed to<br />\nachieve, University divestment.<br />\nAround this time, oppostion to the<br />\nCoalition's activities began to grow<br />\nand become more organized,<br />\nmanifesting itself in such forums as<br />\ncounter-protests to Coalition rallies,<br />\nand posters opposing Coalition activities. This opposition, though, has<br />\nnot necessarily implied changing<br /><br />\nAfrican assistance.<br />\n5. N-L: Is the shanty an effective protest symbol at the moment, and if so, can it continue<br />\nto be one?<br />\nBond responded, \"The shanty<br />\nreminds people of the terrible living conditions that this institution<br />\nis in part responsible for. We<br />\nknow some folks are tired of it,<br />\nso maybe we'll have a chance to<br />\nintrodouce the concept at the<br />\nHospital.\"<br />\nGenest explained that the remains of the shanty. destroyed<br />\nFebruary 26, in the Lower Quad<br />\n\"is a reminder of the lack of<br />\nrespect for freedom of expression \u2014 and that \"for a time, it<br />\nlooks like [a new shanty] is going to be absent from the Lower<br />\nQuad.<br />\n6. N-L: Is the Coalition<br />\nsatisfied with its News-Letter<br />\ncoverage, in terms of amount<br />\nand/or objectivity?<br />\nBond and Genest expressed<br />\ntheir disappointment with<br />\ncoverage, though Genest added,<br />\n\"It's better than the Gazette,<br />\nwhich we consider to be a halfrate Pravda.\"<br />\nCalling the News-Letter's<br />\ncoverage of Coalition activities<br />\n\"spotty,\" Bond noted that the<br />\npaper \"missed\" the settlement<br />\nwith Maryland National, and had<br />\ngiven students the impression<br />\nthat the Coalition had \"invented\"<br />\nthe story of file clippings in<br />\nCoalition members' student loan<br />\nfiles \"even though the day before<br />\npublication, a reporter confirmed their existence.\"<br />\nGenest focused on recent<br /><br />\nstudent views on divestment.<br />\nWe<br />\nCoalition<br />\ninterviewed<br />\nspokesmen Patrick Bond and Paul<br />\nGenest to attempt to address the<br />\nissue of the Coalition's status, as well<br />\nas other issues that we believe<br />\nshould be addressed and have been<br />\naddressed inadequately. We have<br />\ncondensed and summarized their<br />\nresponses based on notes taken<br />\nduring the interview.<br /><br />\nPaul Genest<br /><br />\neditorials. \"The editorials are too<br />\ngentle and accomodating toward<br />\nthe Administration,\" he asserted.<br />\n\"An attitude of greater vigilance<br />\nwould be more appropriate.\"<br />\n7. N-L: What is the Coalition's image of itself?<br />\nGenest responded that the<br />\nCoalition tries to \"perform a<br />\ncritical function in helping to<br />\nraise social conscience,\" while<br />\nBond added, \"We hope our<br />\nsometimes confrontational tactics<br />\nhelp teach other students to be<br />\neffective.\"<br />\n8. N-L: What image do you<br />\nthink the Homewood community has of the Coalition?<br /><br />\nGenest said that the community has a \"misunderstanding of<br />\nwhat we're trying to achieve and<br />\nwhy we use certain means to<br />\nachieve our aims. A lot of people seem to object to the amount<br />\nof media coverage we get, but our<br />\nhope is to get a certain perspective expressed to the various communities served by those media.<br />\n\"A lot of people have strong<br />\nfeelings for and against what we<br />\ndo,\" he continued, but we<br />\nthink on the whole that people<br />\ntake this action as an improvement over the previous politically moribund era at Hopkins.\"<br />\n9. N-L: Is the Coalition<br />\nsatisfied with its image within<br />\nthe Homewood community?<br />\n\"Not entirely,\u2014 said Bond.<br />\n\"Our actions have been so controversial on campus that some<br />\nfew people haven't taken the time<br />\nto judge our work in the<br />\nBaltimore community as a whole.<br />\nCriticism of our approach may be<br />\nlargely unwarranted.<br />\nHe also contended that \"by and<br />\nlarge, we've done more in the last<br />\nfifteen months in the way of<br />\nserious activism than anyone<br />\nthought this campus could<br />\nsupport.\"<br />\n10. N-L: Are you pleased at<br />\nthe type of opposition that has<br />\narisen recently against the<br />\nCoalition?<br />\n\"I personally consider the main<br />\nopposition to be the intransigent<br />\nattitude of the Trustees,\" he said.<br />\n\"The College Republicans are<br />\nmerely a diversion. We hope in<br />\nthe future they try to be more<br />\naccurate.\"<br /><br />\nUniversity Revises<br />\nIncompletes Policy<br />\nTo Tighten Process<br />\n1.\\l. ksta<br />\nIn an effort to check what Martha Roseman. associate dean of<br />\nacademic advising. called a<br />\n\"looser and looser \u2014 interpretation of incompletes. a new incompletes policy has been instituted effective this semester.<br />\nThe move was made for<br />\n\"documenting incompletes better. \u2014 said Roseman. who<br />\nestimates the total number of incompletes per semester to be in<br />\nthe hundreds. Roseman also added that the new process will be<br />\nmore fair to the student who<br />\nbreaks their neck to get things in<br />\non time...<br />\nThe new incomplete process<br />\nrequires the student to pick up a<br />\nfive-part form, Resolution of Incomplete. which is similar to an<br />\nadd/drop slip, from Academic<br />\n, Advising and Counseling. These<br />\nforms can be accessed freely and<br />\ndo not require any meeting with<br />\nAdvising and Counseling.

Specifically, debate centered on the scuffle which<br />\nbroke out between Scott David Lippe<br />\nand a non-student pro-Coalition protester. At its last meeting before Spring<br />\nBreak, Council analyzed the scuffle in<br />\ndetail. This week, Council re-analyzed<br />\nits earlier analyses.

Isn't it about<br />\ntime that someone took Student<br />\nCouncil on this campus seriously?<br /><br />\nRecently all undergraduates<br />\nreceived a sternly worded note<br />\nfrom the Office of Academic Advising about Incompletes. We<br />\nwere informed that the Committee for Undergraduate Studies had<br />\nevidence of flagrant abuses of the<br />\nsystem by students. Tough new<br />\nmeasures intended to curb the use<br />\nof extensions are to be implemented this semester. These<br />\ninclude a stringent formal definition of the Incomplete as an extension on the due date for work<br />\ngranted because of problems<br />\nbeyond the student's control, a<br />\nformal deadline by which the In-<br /><br />\nand was less likely to turn in first<br />\nclass work. The argument holds<br />\nas long as it assumed that the two<br />\nstudents are taking similar class<br />\nloads.<br />\nThe Committee should<br />\nrecognize that most of the use,<br />\nand the abuse, of the Incompletq<br />\ngrade hhs come from students in<br />\nthe Humanities and Social<br />\nScience courses. Since grading in<br />\nthese areas is based on the quality of pages written in relation to<br />\nthe number of pages read, two<br />\nquestions seem relevant to<br />\ngrading practices in these areas:<br />\nIs there really a standard amount<br /><br />\nrich bigelow<br />\ncomplete is to be resolved, and a<br />\nwritten justification for the In-'<br />\ncomplete filled out in quintuplet<br />\nand sent to the Registrar,<br />\nAcademic Advising, the student's<br />\nfaculty advisor, and the professor<br />\nwho granted the Incomplete.<br />\nThese efforts to curtail the<br />\nabuse of an academic loophole<br />\nare admirable. The setting of absolute due dates for Incompletes<br />\nwill reform a particularly unwarranted grading practice here: I am<br />\naware of one student who resolved an Incomplete three and a half<br />\nyears after it was granted.<br />\nPresumably this will no longer be<br />\npossible. There are reasons why<br />\nthe Incomplete has become as<br />\nubiquitous as it is, however.<br />\nGuidelines restricting the use of<br />\nextensions go a certain distance in<br />\naddressing the symptoms of an<br />\nacademic problem here, but not<br />\nfar enough to eliminate its source.<br />\non<br />\nCommittee<br />\nThe<br />\nUndergraduate Studies justifies<br />\nthe tightening of the requirements<br />\nfor excuses by pointing out the injustice of someone receiving the<br />\nsame, or better, grade for a<br />\ncourse as another who turned in<br />\nthe work on time. The latter student worked under more pressure<br /><br />\nof work expected from the student taking 12 to 21 credits, and<br />\nhow is it apportioned? Given the<br />\nprobability of better written work<br />\nproduced by a student with more<br />\ntime or a lighter workload, how<br />\nmuch of a grade should be based<br />\non the student's fulfillment of the<br />\nterms of the syllabus and how<br />\nmuch on the actual quality of the<br />\nwritten work?<br />\nThe requirements for grading<br />\nin many courses, particularly upper level Humanities seminars,<br />\nvary enormously.

Some deadly<br />\nviral strain had infected his renal<br />\nsystem. No one knew if he would<br />\nsurvive. I was in Baltimore. It had<br />\nto be part of some supernatural<br />\nplan. It was my destiny. . . to<br />\ntake his place. Tom in town.<br />\nIt was my first day at Hopkins.<br />\nA relative newcomer by any standards, I felt like an old hand<br />\nalready. Maybe that was because<br />\nthere already was a Tom<br />\nMcNamara enrolled on the<br />\nBaltimore campus. He was a<br />\nfake. I knew very well that I was<br />\nthe real Tom McNamara and this<br />\nwas my first day: April 8. By<br />\nnoon I found the crumbled remains of the once-proud Shanty<br />\nvillage on the Hopkins mall. I<br />\nwandered through the zoo of<br />\nsculptured animals in the flower<br />\ngarden near where Ike's brother<br />\nonce ruled proud over the<br />\nUniversity. Impressive. Real<br />\nnice.<br />\nYou may be wondering, and<br />\nrightly so, what I was doing here<br />\nat Hopkins in the first place. I was<br />\n,on an East Coast odyssey. A guy<br />\nfrom Minnesota (It's a state near<br />\nMinneapolis) out to see the<br />\nworld. The previous week had<br />\ntaken me through Boston, New<br />\nYork, New<br />\nHaven and<br />\nWashington. After much wandering I finally arrived in the geomagnetic center of the whole East<br />\nCoast complex. Baltimore. There<br />\nwere seals here, and plenty of<br />\nthem. There was even a big fat<br />\none who wouldn't go in the water<br />\nno matter how much we pleaded<br />\nwith him. I could see his reasoning. A big warship docked nearby, anything could happen. The<br />\nharbour was exciting but real<br />\ndangerous. I walked around<br />\nanyway, in mixed company of<br />\ncourse.<br />\nWe switched gears and decided to experience the seamier side<br />\nof Baltimore. Even Minnesotans<br />\nhad heard stories about the The<br />\nHorse You Came In On Bar. It<br />\nwas famous. There were lots of<br />\nrough and ready sailors down<br />\nthere. A real tough lot of sea<br />\nsalts. It was dangerous, real<br />\ndangerous. We went in anyway.<br />\nSome tough, bearded sailor was<br />\nsinging old Men At Work tunes.<br />\nSailors like that kind of stuff.<br />\nThere was even free popcorn.<br />\n.Simply unbelievable. People in<br /><br />\nBaltimore really live the high life.<br />\nIt was back to Hopkins and that<br />\ndynamic social center on Charles:<br />\nPls. There were pillars of<br />\nacademia everywhere. Lots of<br />\ndiscussions on chromosomes and<br />\nneuron receptors. Those Hoppies<br />\nwere smart, real smart. I didn't<br />\nstand a chance. I resolved to attend a biological engineering<br />\ncourse the next day to make up<br />\nfor lost time. And for pleasure of<br />\ncourse.<br />\nI didn't make it to class the next<br />\nmorning but I did have a good<br />\nreason. I sort of wanted to sleep<br />\nsome more, besides I wasn't<br />\nenrolled anyways. They can't<br />\ndock you letter points when<br />\nyou're not supposed to be there,<br />\nnot even at Hopkins. I felt pretty<br />\nguilty anyway. I decided to make<br />\nup for it by touring the campus<br />\nvery intensely.<br />\nIt was an amzaing place for a<br />\nguy from the Mid-West. After all<br />\nthis was the city that claimed the<br />\nbirthplace of Betsy Ross. It was<br />\nvery colonial. Hopkins was once<br />\na farm and it showed. Charles<br />\nCarroll's barn was now a<br />\nprestigious drama center. From<br />\nhay-filled horse stalls to contemporary theatre; there was nothing<br />\nthese Hoppies didn't think of.<br />\nOne could only wonder what<br />\nwould happen to the old Ham<br />\nRadio building. A hockey rink or<br />\na hospital, the possibilities were<br />\nendless here at Hopkins. Gilman<br />\nHall was home to a quaint cafe,<br />\na Post Office which mailed letters<br />\nall over the known world and a<br />\nplethora of financial institutions.<br />\nIt was a multi-purpose kind of<br />\nplace.<br />\nThe afternoon found Blue Jays<br />\nall over campus playing ball with<br />\nfunny little netted sticks. It looked fun, maybe just a little too fun.<br />\nI decided on a little racquetball instead. Some of these Hoppies<br />\nwere really athletic types. I decided to lose on purpose and blame<br />\nthose funny squash courts.<br />\nThe day was drawing to a<br />\nclose. It was my first day at the<br />\nbig JHU. I retired to a typewriter<br />\nat the old Gatehouse now housing the Hopkins News-Letter.<br />\nLots of history there. Who knows<br />\nwhat those crazy gatekeepers used to do in the sev&amp;teenth century. But the evening was yet<br />\nyoung.

What's going on here?''<br />\nI asked a small but vocal group<br />\nof students milling about in front<br />\nof the Placement Office. They<br />\nwere toting picket signs and chanting songs. \"What are you protesting?\" I called to them. \"Can<br />\nI help.\" I waved at them, putting<br />\non my interested and gullible face<br />\nuntil they stopped milling and<br />\nstared at me.<br />\nThe group charged.

A significant percentage of the graduate students in<br />\nthe Department of Political<br />\nScience signed their petition. The<br />\none<br />\namong<br />\ncirculated<br />\nundergraduates collected 308<br />\nsignatures, of which over 220<br />\nwere those of Political Science or<br />\nInternational Studies majors.<br />\nThough the quantity of Lettersto-the-Editor has diminished, the<br />\nconcern has not. Unfortunately,<br />\nwe have yet to hear any response<br />\nfrom the Academic Council. Of<br />\ncourse, there have been rumors<br />\nthat the decision is being reconsidered and should be finalized<br />\n\"very soon.\"<br />\nI appreciate the fact that this<br />\nwill be a weighty decision since<br />\nit will affect Dr. David, the<br />\nPolitical Science Department, Dr.<br />\nDavid's advisees, his students,<br />\nmany graduate students who plan<br />\nto take their comprehensive exams in the near future, and all of<br />\nthe Political Science and International Studies majors. Also, the<br />\nrepercussions will be felt in the<br />\nIS program in the years to come.<br />\nThe futures of over 300<br />\nundergraduates alone will be<br />\ntouched. Furthermore, a much<br />\nlarger question has been raised<br />\nwithin the Hopkins undergraduate<br />\ncommunity: \"How much attention does, and will, the<br />\nundergraduate education at<br />\nHopkins receive?\" Is our educa-<br /><br />\ntion being compromised as<br />\nHopkins returns to the ranks of<br />\nthose \"fine research institutions\"<br />\nwith little to offer to its<br />\nundergraduates?<br />\nIndeed, this decision will be an<br />\nimportant one and should be well<br />\nconsidered. But, speaking of consideration, is it not time to show<br />\nsome to Dr. David? It is already<br />\nlate in the year and every passing day is one more day for his<br />\nfuture at Hopkins to remain in<br />\nlimbo. Even now it is questionable whether Dr. David<br />\nwould stay if re-offered his post<br />\nwith promotion\u2014after all, he<br />\nmust consider his own future.<br />\nFurther delay can only decrease<br />\nthe possibility.<br />\nIt is time for the Academic<br />\nCouncil to offer some response to<br />\nthe appeal of so many concerned<br />\nstudents. It seems that the administrators have become so accustomed to protest \"Coalitionstyle\", that they are immune to<br />\nanything else. Maybe we should<br />\nconsider moving into Merryman<br /><br />\nHall and renaming it. . .<br />\nDepti Kharod<br /><br />\nAbove the Law<br />\nTo the Editor:<br />\nAs we all know, the freedom of<br />\nexpression has been threatened on<br />\nthis campus recently. The threat<br />\ntakes two forms. Firstly, this<br />\nfreedom has been obstructed and<br />\nviolated by the ripping down and<br />\ndefacement of posters on campus.<br />\nSecondly, this freedom has been<br />\nabused by a disregard for rules<br />\nand laws which limit free<br />\nexpression.<br />\nThe first threat has been felt by<br />\ncampus political groups on both<br />\nsides of the spectrum. As a College Republican I have experienced the effects of this vandalism<br />\nfirst-hand. The CRs often have to<br />\nposter campus bulletin boards<br />\nseveral times a day. The results<br />\nof this vandalism are losses in<br />\ntime, effort and money. In addi-<br /><br />\ntion, recently an off-campus<br />\ngroup called BERN wrote insulting remarks on one of our<br />\nposters, of which photocopies<br />\nwere made. The copies were<br />\nplaced on bulletin boards.<br />\nWe sympathize with the<br />\nHopkins Latin American Action<br />\nCommittee, which had its posters<br />\nsimilarly defaced. Contrary to<br />\nBob Baer's insinuations, the College Republicans were not<br />\nresponsible for this act. I have<br />\nbeen to every CR meeting, and<br />\nknow that there was never any<br />\nserious mention of buying a<br />\nstamp. The \"order form\" Baer<br />\nmentions advertised many items.<br />\nThese items reflected an ideology<br />\nextremely far to the right; hence<br />\nwe found them absurdly funny,<br />\nand joked about all of them.<br />\nThat's all the information I have,<br />\nand I submit it freely. Baer and<br />\nhis group need not selfrighteously \"insist\" that information be given. His presumptuous<br />\ntone and libelous accusations<br />\nwere certainly uncalled for.<br /><br />\nThis leads us to the second<br />\nform of violation of the freedom<br />\nof expression. Self-righteousness<br />\ncan foster the belief that one is<br />\nabove laws and rules. Obviously<br />\nsome anti-CIA activists hold this<br />\nattitude; they violated postering<br />\npolicy (Cmon guys -- posters on<br />\ntrees?) and one BERN member<br />\neven assaulted someone. I<br />\nassume, at least I hope, that<br />\nBERN members and other nonstudents were the only ones that<br />\nshowed such flagrant disregard<br />\nfor this University and those who<br />\nbelong in it. Since a good percentage of the demonstrators were<br />\nnon-students, this is quite probable. Since I do not know of<br />\nanyone else affiliated with these<br />\npeople, I must ask the Hopkins<br />\nLatin American Action Group to<br />\ntell these people how people are<br />\nexpected to conduct themselves<br />\non this campus.

Firstly, Mr. Genest 'advises' the College Republicans<br />\nthat their signs \"make people giggle and even snicker,\" and that<br />\nit is better to be taken seriously.<br />\nI find this statement very<br />\nhumorous coming from Mr.<br />\nGenest, whose group, the Coalition, staged a 'protest' in which<br />\nthree people with the letters C, I,<br />\nand A across their chests pranced across the stage and performed slapstick on the steps of<br />\nGilman. Some protest, Mr.<br />\nGenest! This is just one example<br />\nof the Coalition's hypocrisy and<br />\nbetween<br />\ndouble standard<br />\nthemselves and the rest of the<br />\nHomewood community.<br />\nMr. Finnerty also uses this<br />\ndouble standard. He says that<br />\nScott Lippe \"Needlessly provokeldi another member of the<br />\nanti-CIA group.\" What Mr.<br />\nLippe did was simply what the<br />\nCoalition has attempted to do<br />\nmany times themselves. Along<br />\nwith the College Republican<br />\ncounter-protesters, Mr. Lippe<br />\nverbally attempted to disrupt the<br />\nCoalition protest with a<br />\nmegaphone.<br />\nHasn't the Coalition verbally<br />\nand physically disrupted the campus with shanties, Mandela Hall,<br />\netc., all in the name of freedom<br />\nof expression? In any case, Mr.<br />\nLippe's verbal \"provocation,\" as<br />\nMr. Finnerty calls it, should have<br />\nbeen countered with a verbal<br />\nresponse. However, a protester<br />\njumped Lippe, broke his<br />\nmegaphone, and had to be pulled<br />\noff of Lippe. This assault was<br />\nmagnified by two facts: (1) This<br />\nattacker was in no way affiliated<br />\nwith the University, and (2)Campus security refused to remove<br />\nthis person from the protest.<br />\nSecurity claimed that the removal<br />\nof the protester would cause more<br />\nof a disturbance.

I suggest<br />\nthat if the Coalition would like to<br />\nprotest with their radical, derelict<br />\ncomrades, they should do so off<br />\ncampus, where assaults such as<br />\nthe one that occurred on March<br />\n16 would be met with immediate<br />\npolice action and not apathy.<br />\nThanks. to the Hopkins NewsLitter for printing Mr. Finnerty's<br />\nand Mr. Genest's letters in the<br />\nApril Fool's edition.<br />\nMichael Farbowitz<br /><br />\nIncomplete Policy: Jeopardizing Trust<br />\nContinued from Page 8<br />\nreceived the amount of credit he<br />\nor she deserved for a course, based on an objective standard of the<br />\namount of reading or writing<br />\nwhich actually constitutes one<br />\ncredit, a number of the people<br />\nwho rely on Incompletes would<br />\nonly be taking three or four<br />\ncourses apiece. The number of<br />\nIncompletes awarded each<br />\nsemester would decrease, and the<br />\nquality of writing produced in upper level courses would probably<br />\nimprove. It would also have the<br />\neffect of equalizing grading standards in the numerous upper diviwhich<br />\nin<br />\ncourses<br />\nsion<br />\nundergraduates compete with<br />\ngraduate students.<br /><br />\nThe letter from Academic Advising left the impression that Incompletes were exploited as a<br />\nmeans to shirk the various<br />\npressures that all students are expected to bear, and that their virtual elimination will insure<br />\nfairness, even if it jeopardizes the<br />\nquality of the writing produced at<br />\nthe school. My experience has<br />\nbeen that Incompletes serve as<br />\none of the only tools at the student's disposal to achieve a<br />\nreasonable workload at a school<br />\nwhere grading standards vary.<br />\nThe idea that anything which<br />\nendangers the quality of work<br />\nproduced here is beneficial to the<br />\nstudents is positively perverse. A<br />\nstudent in an upper level<br />\nHumanities course is looking not<br /><br />\njust for a grade, but for constructive criticism of his or her<br />\nwriting, and for recommendations for graduate schools. It is in<br />\nthe interest of that student to take<br />\nthe most challenging courses in<br />\nhis or her area of interest, and<br />\nthereby seek the recommendations which carry the most<br />\nweight. So long as these courses<br />\nare awarded the same credit as<br />\nlower division classes, that student runs the risk of producing<br />\nsubstandard work in a limited<br />\ntimeframe, or of relying on Incompletes. Neither of these options is productive.<br />\nAs a senior, I have had many<br />\npositive learning experiences here<br />\nat Hopkins. Most of these grew<br />\nout of a sense of trust between my<br /><br />\nprofessors and myself.

When an administration, or any authority<br />\nwhich is not directly involved in<br />\nthe learning process, interposes<br />\nitself between the professor and<br />\nthe student, it jeopardizes this<br />\nsense of trust. The stagnation of<br />\nthe academic enterprise itself<br />\nbecomes possible, and it would be<br />\nan egregious error for this school<br />\nto allow that condition to develop.<br />\nThe restriction of the use of Incompletes deters students from<br />\nabusing<br />\ntheir<br />\nacademic<br />\nprivileges.

Recently<br />\nHullabaloo has sent representatives to the Columbia Scholastic<br />\nPress Association's College Journalism Convention, discussing<br />\nideas and seeing samples of yearbooks from across the country.<br />\nOne important result of these trips<br />\nhas been the increased use of the<br />\ncomputer to help with layout and<br />\ngraphics. However, the biggest<br />\nchange in the book over the past<br />\nfew years has been the use of<br />\nmore copy.<br />\nThe biggest difference is in<br />\norganization.

Ivey<br /><br />\nReaping The Whirlwind is an<br />\nin-depth study of race relations in<br />\nMacon County, Alabama. Spanning more than a century, it takes<br />\nthe reader from Reconstruction<br />\ninto the early 1980's, and places<br />\nthe civil rights movement of the<br />\n1960's in a much larger historical<br />\ncontext. There, the author<br />\nfocuses on two struggles in particular: voting rights and school<br />\ndesegregation. Through local<br />\ndocuments and detailed interviews, Norell brings the racial<br />\nconflict down to the level of the<br />\nindividual, each with his own<br />\nfears and ambitions. Men such as<br />\nBooker T. Washington and<br />\nGeorge Wallace lose their largerthan-life aura in Norell's hands<br />\nand become both understandable<br />\nand approachable on a human<br />\nlevel.<br />\nThere is a value to this work<br />\nwhich goes beyond the history of<br />\nMacon County. The struggle<br />\nNorell details is a strange one: it<br />\n\u2022 is economic and political and at<br />\nthe same time it is neither. Such<br />\nis the nature of racial conflict. It<br />\nis not enough to say that blacks<br />\nare a politically, economically,<br />\nand educationally disadvantaged<br />\ngroup, and that by isolating and<br />\naddressing these issues their problems will dissipate. There is a<br />\ndistinct and unavoidable disadvantage to being in the black<br />\nminority in this country, which<br />\ncan only be discussed in the context of racism. This is the<br />\nmessage that Norell, perhaps unconsciously, most clearly states.<br />\nThe blacks of Macon County<br />\nwere denied their rights in this<br />\nsociety because they were black,<br />\nand for no other reason. This is<br />\nthe reason why this book and<br />\nothers like it have a fundamental<br />\nimportance.<br />\nIn 1987 many would like to<br />\nbelieve that slavery was long ago,<br />\nthat racism has been all but<br />\neradicated, that in fact the civil<br />\nrights movement of the 1960's<br />\nplaced blacks on an equal footing<br />\nwith the majority, eliminating<br />\nrace as a factor to success. Norell<br />\nreminds us that this is simply not<br />\nthe case. Consider the case of<br />\nJohn Battle, Governor of<br />\nAlabama until 1962.\"'My constant companion during my<br />\nboyhood days,' Battle told the<br />\nAlabama officials, 'was Cullen<br />\nA. Battle, the Confederate<br />\nGeneral who in 1870 led Macon<br />\nCounty conservatives in their<br />\nviolent retrieval of political power<br />\nfrom James Alston and the black<br />\nrepublicans . . . None of you<br />\nwhite citizens and officials of<br />\nAlabama believe more strongly<br />\nthan I do in the segregation of the<br />\nraces as the right and proper way<br />\nof life in the South.'\" Keep in<br />\nmind that confederate generals<br />\nwere slave owners, and that Battle's euphemism, \"violent<br />\nretrieval,\" was realized as<br />\nbeatings, arson and murder<br />\nagainst elected black officials.<br />\nThen perhaps slavery and its<br />\neffects are not that far removed<br />\nfrom the present; but surely, the<br />\nignorance that breeds racism has<br />\nbeen eliminated. The author<br />\nrecalls that George Wallace succeeded Battle as governor of<br />\nAlabama. An infamous opponent<br /><br />\nof the civil rights movement, in<br />\nhis inaugural speech he declared,<br />\n\"In the name of the greatest people that have ever trod the earth<br />\n. . .1 say segregation now!<br />\nSegregation tomorrow! Segregation forever!\" George Wallace<br />\nwas governor of Alabama until<br />\nlast year; still extremely popular,<br />\nhe retired because of failing<br />\nhealth. Racism is alive and<br />\nflourishing. Recent violence in<br />\nNew York City reminds us that<br />\nthis is not just a Southern<br />\nproblem.<br />\nMoreover, in the 1980's,<br />\nblacks are, if anything, \"less<br />\nequal\" than during the fight for<br />\nequality. Norell comments on this<br />\nin his conclusion. \"Conservatives<br /><br />\nauthority as a result of the rapid<br />\nexpansion ot federal and state<br />\npower in the 1950's and 60's.<br />\nDecisions about education,<br />\nwelfare, criminal justice, and<br />\neducational development in<br />\nMacon County were more likely<br />\nto be made outside the county<br />\nthan within it. Poor blacks could<br />\nhardly influence those more<br />\nremote governments . . .Failures<br />\nof interracial cooperation were,<br />\nof course, also a legacy of<br />\nsegregation. Most citizens, black<br />\nand white, were simply unable to<br />\novercome in a few years the<br />\ngenerations of racial alienation<br />\nand hatred that Macon Countians<br />\nhad experienced.\"<br />\nToday this nation is faced with<br /><br />\ntoo painful lessons of the past. Attempting to move forward by<br />\nforgetting the past is the path of<br />\nfools. Works such as Reaping The<br />\nWhirlwind are an important<br />\nbeginning in the understanding of<br />\nrace relations.<br />\nWhy was Macon County<br />\nchosen for such a detailed work<br />\non racial conflict? With a population of about 8,000 by 1960<br />\nspread over three towns and huge<br />\nexpanses of farmland, it would<br />\nnot at first seem to be at the<br />\nforefront of anything. Yet there<br />\nare several important things to<br />\nconsider when looking at Macon<br />\nCounty. First, blacks had been in<br />\nthe majority since the beginning<br />\nof the 19th century. Second,<br />\nMacon is in Alabama, a key<br />\npower in the Confederate States<br />\nof America, and under the leadership of Gov. George Wallace, a<br />\nrelentless opponent of the federal<br />\ngovernment and the civil rights<br />\nmovement. To quote Norell,<br />\n\" . . Macon County can best be<br />\nunderstood in the context of<br />\nevolving white anxieties. In the<br />\n1850's many white Alabamians<br />\n\"Prwisely the kind of first-class study of a local segment<br />\nhad feared losing their inof the civil rights movement which illuminates the whole:.<br />\n-HARRISON F:SA MOURN'<br />\ndependence and autonomy. which<br />\nthey felt were being threatened by<br />\nabolitionism and northern opposition to slavery's expansion...Losing the war affirmed<br />\nfor many white southerners the<br />\nlegitimacy of their earlier fears.<br />\nThe subsequent uncertainty about<br />\nthe nature of the postwar society<br />\naggravated their fear, and Radical<br />\nReconstruction only exacerbated<br />\nanxieties that were firmly<br />\nembedded in the minds of<br />\nmany.\" Alabama was the heart of<br />\nSouthern conservatism. Third,<br />\nand most important, Tuskegee Institute, one of the first and finest<br />\nblack institutions for higher<br />\neducation was in the county seat,<br />\nTuskegee. Thus, both black and<br />\nwhite leadership were located in<br />\nthe same town.<br />\nNorell traces the relationship<br />\nbetween the leaders of both communities, as the blacks of Macon<br />\nCounty attempted to claim what<br />\nwas theirs under the Constitution,<br />\nwhile white conservatives resisted<br />\nthis effort to redistribute the<br />\npower. He opens with Cullen A.<br />\nBattle leading white conservatives<br />\nin removing the Reconstruction<br />\nblack politicians from the county<br />\nthrough violence and intimidation. A decade later, in 1881.<br />\nBooker T. Washington founds<br />\nTuskegee Institute, an attempt by<br />\nthe white community to secure<br />\ntheir power base by controlling<br />\nthe education of blacks.<br />\nWashington, however, had ideas<br />\nof his own, and the long, painfully slow struggle for equality in<br />\nMacon County began.<br />\nhad lost the hegemony they had the prospect of a population<br />\nLater, in the 1930's, George<br />\nfought so hard to maintain, and which will be over 50% non-white Gommillion, a young professor at<br />\nmany felt it necessary to leave the in 20 years, and a significant por- Tuskegee, emerged as the leader<br />\ncommunity rather than live under tion of that population will be of the black community.

NOR RELL<br /><br />\nsolute power of white conservatives. only a gradualist approach would have been<br />\nsuccessful.<br />\nNorell's treatment of the white<br />\ncommunity is perhaps the<br />\nstrongest part of the work. Unlike<br />\nthe black community, there was<br />\na myriad of white politicians,<br />\nbusinessmen, and prominent<br />\ncitizens opposed to the social<br />\nchanges being sought, and the<br />\nauthor includes almost all of<br />\nthem. Norell was skillfully able<br />\nto emphasize the most important<br />\nof them, such as Judge William<br />\nVarner, and Governors Battle and<br />\nWallace, without diminishing the<br />\ncontributions of the lesser<br />\ncharacters, or overwhelming the<br />\nreader with information. He has<br />\npossessed a keen understanding<br />\nof the southern white society,<br />\nperhaps because he is a white<br />\nsoutherner himself, and neither<br />\ncondemns nor defends the conservatives. These characters become<br />\nquite human and plausible in his<br />\nhands. There was also a small but<br />\nsignificant contingent of white<br />\nliberals who supported the social<br />\nchanges. Norell adds uncustomary depth to his treatment<br />\nof them by detailing the importance of their backgrounds to<br />\ntheir liberal views, and why they<br />\nwere disenfranchised under the<br />\nexisting power Structure.<br />\nThe book moves quickly<br />\nthrough the 1960's, focusing on<br />\nthe changes in the power structure<br />\nwithin the black community.<br />\nStudents, dissatisfied with the<br />\ngradualist approach and the<br />\ngrowing distance between the<br />\nblack middle and lower classes,<br />\nrapidly became the new,<br />\n\"grassroots\" leadership of the<br />\nblack community.

He<br />\nbrings together a century of<br />\nseemingly disjointed events into<br />\na unified and continuous history.<br />\nThe major weakness of<br />\nNorell's book is in his treatment<br />\nof the black leaders. While he<br />\ndiscusses them fairly, accurately,<br />\nand with considerable detail, they<br />\nnonetheless lack the depth and<br />\nhumanity of his white characters.<br />\nHe discusses blacks with a certain<br />\ndetachment, a distance not felt<br />\nwhen he deals with the white<br />\ncharacters. This may be a shortcoming of his research, cases<br />\nwhere black sources may not<br />\nhave been as open and frank with<br />\nhim as the white sources. Or<br />\nperhaps it is a reflection of the<br />\nmind of the author, who is<br />\nhimself a white southerner and<br />\nmay not understand the black segment of his long-segregated<br />\nsociety as well as he does the<br />\nwhite. In either case, the flaw is<br />\nsignificant but not disastrous.<br />\nReaping The Whirlwind is a<br />\ngood place to begin an understanding of the civil rights movement.<br />\nIt is a balanced, accurate, and important work. In addition, there<br />\nare several books available in the<br />\nlibrary on Tuskegee Institute,<br />\nSNCC. CORE, Dr. Martin<br />\nLuther King, Jr., and Malcolm<br />\nX, which would make excellent<br />\nfollow-ups.<br /><br />\n22/APRIL 10, 1987<br /><br />\nScience<br />\nA Healthy Lifestyle Even for Hopkins Students<br />\nby Kim Juvan<br />\n\"Sound mind, sound body,\"<br />\n\"You are what you eat.<br />\nWe're all familiar with these<br />\nphrases, but many of us take their<br />\nmeaning for granted. According<br />\nto Linda Rhoades, adult nurse<br />\npractitioner at the Student Health<br />\nClinic, college students \"can get<br />\naway with poor diet/exercise<br />\nhabits.\u2014 For example, if they fall<br />\ninto a routine of doughnut/coffee<br />\nbreakfasts or no morning food at<br />\nall, they may just get a dragging<br />\nfeeling until lunchtime. However,<br />\nby the time they reach their thirties, \"the caffeine and poor diet<br />\nhabits can manifest themselves as<br />\nphysical ailments. . . such as<br />\nulcers.\"<br />\nFor everyone without special<br />\nmedical needs, Ms. Rhoades'<br />\ndietary advice is very simple: ample portions of the four basic food<br />\ngroups (meat [2 servings/dayl,<br />\nvegetables [4], grains [41, dairy<br />\n[4]) on a regular, daily schedule<br />\nto provide necessary vitamins and<br />\nminerals. And, she adds that<br />\ncaloric intake should be apportioned with 20%,30%, and 50%<br />\nfrom protein, carbohydrates, and<br />\nfat, respectively. Ms. Rhoades<br />\npoints out that vitamin pills are<br />\ninadequate substitutes for natural<br />\nsources which are\". . . better absorbed and metabolized by the<br />\nbody.\"<br />\nMs. Rhoades has observed that<br />\nmany Hopkins students follow inadequate and irregular diet plans<br />\nwhich can adversely affect their<br />\ndaily lives. She says the coffee<br />\nand doughnut breakfast \"is one of<br />\nthe worst ways to treat your body<br />\nin the morning.\" The \"sugar<br />\nhigh \u2014 is quickly followed by<br />\nhypoglycemia, an abnormal<br />\ndecrease in blood sugar which<br />\nrobs the body of energy. Alcohol,<br />\nshe adds, \"provides no vitamins<br />\nor minerals but is loaded with<br />\nempty calories.\"<br />\nIn time, an inadequate diet can<br />\nevidence itself in physical appearance and general attitude.<br />\nFor example, low iron intake<br />\ncauses anemia because fewer re0<br /><br />\nblood cells are available to carry<br />\noxygen; a person looks pale, gets<br />\nshort of breath when exercising,<br />\nand feels generally rundown. A<br />\ngood diet, insists Ms. Rhoades,<br />\nkeeps hair and skin healthy and<br />\nimproves mental acuity for an<br />\noverall feeling of well-being.<br />\nFor weight loss, Ms. Rhoades<br />\nadvises ignoring fad diets and<br />\nsticking rigidly by the regular<br />\nplan mentioned previously.<br />\n\"Weight loss comes with lower<br />\ncaloric intake . . .and exercise,\"<br />\nshe says, and adds that the Student Health Center can help<br />\nstudents plan a personal<br />\ndiet/calorie schedule according to<br />\ntheir personal histories. The<br />\nschedule's progress would be<br />\nmonitored every three weeks.<br />\nMs. Rhoades stresses that increased physical activity should<br />\nbe accompanied by eating more<br />\nnatural carbohydrates: grains,<br />\nfruits, and vegetables. These<br />\nfoods \"add more minerals to the<br />\nbody.. .to replace sodium and<br />\npotassium lost by sweating.\" She<br />\nexplains that losing these electrolytes \"can cause severe abdominal and leg cramps.\u2014 She<br />\nalso emphasizes that unlike carbohydrates, protein is not<br />\nmetabolized by the body during<br />\nexercise and that training tones<br />\nand builds muscle mass. As a<br />\nwarning, she points out that protein increases fluid intake, which<br />\nmay overload the kidneys, causing calcium loss.<br />\nLike a good diet, exercise provides many benefits for those who<br />\ntake time for it. Assistant athletic<br />\ntrainer Joanne McGurney has<br />\nbecome familiar with the exercising habits of Hopkins students<br />\nsince arriving here last January.<br />\nShe currently works in the<br />\nAthletic Center's Training Room<br />\nwhere she helps take care of intercollegiate athletes, providing<br />\ntaping or support equipment and<br />\nrehabilitation services for injured<br />\nathletes. Though the training<br />\nroom serves mostly intercollegiate athletes, it does administer emergency first-aid to<br />\nnon-athletes and takes on a few<br /><br />\nstudents referred from the Health<br />\nCenter.<br />\nAccording to Ms. McGurney,<br />\nthe most popular fitness activity<br />\nfor Hopkins students is jogging,<br />\nfollowed closely by swimming<br />\nand weight-lifting. She adds,<br />\n\"There are more females in<br />\nweight-lifting than before,\" and<br />\nthat weight programs for individuals are set up if desired.<br />\nMs. McGurney emphasizes the<br />\nimportance for everyone to participate in some sort of regular<br />\nexercise program. For those just<br />\nbeginning, she suggests an alternating jogging/walking program.<br />\n\"It's easy to keep jogging. . .once you start slowly,\"<br />\nshe explains and points out that<br />\noverweight individuals should be<br />\nespecially wary of overdoing it.<br />\nJogging, if done properly, isn't<br />\ndangerous. Ms. McGurney attributes the few injuries she sees,<br />\nfor example shin-splints and foot<br />\nproblems, to improper technique.<br />\nJogging should be done on<br />\ncushion-backed or grassy surfaces, as opposed to cement<br />\nwhere the shock from pounding<br />\ncannot be absorbed.

Those who despise<br />\nexercising now \"may find it<br />\nhabit-forming.\" As a personal<br />\nnote, she remarks, \"I used to<br /><br />\nIlene Jacobs<br /><br />\nIntercollegiate athletes to non-serious runners flock to the Hopkins track<br />\nfor a dail work out.

The<br />\nbest time to exercise is a while<br />\nafter eating, thereby increasing<br />\nmetabolism and burning off<br />\ncalories right away.<br />\nAn extremely important but<br />\noften overlooked benefit of exercising relates to mental wellbeing. Ms. McGurney points out<br />\nthat it is an effective stress<br />\nreliever because \"it diverts your<br />\nconcentration away from a<br /><br />\ntest. . .from worrying. Even<br />\nthough you may have to face studying again. . .exercising gives<br />\nyou a feeling of accomplishment.\" Self-improvement comes<br />\nfrom both building physically and<br />\nmentally.<br />\nThe best overall picture' of<br />\nwell-being involves a good diet<br />\nand regular exercise. Without exercise, the tone and size of a muscle declines, whereas a diet of<br />\nmilkshakes and burgers cannot be<br />\ncompensated for by rigorous exercise. Finally, consider time<br />\nspent preparing for a three-course<br />\nmeal and regular swimming or<br />\nracquetball an investment in mental sharpness as well.<br /><br />\nWomen in Science: They Can Make a Difference<br />\nby Ely Brown<br />\nScience and medicine for the<br />\nbetter part of history have been<br />\na man's realm, but now things are<br />\nbeginning to change. To what extent have women influenced<br />\nmedicine up until now? How can<br />\nthey alter it in the future? These<br />\nquestions and others were the<br />\nfocal point for the fourth lecture<br />\nin the series \"The Public Interest<br />\nin Science.\" Two female scientists were the main speakers for<br />\nthe evening: Elizabeth Fee of the<br />\nJohns Hopkins University School<br />\nof Hygiene and Public Health,<br />\nand Ruth Hubbard from Harvard<br />\nUniversity.<br />\nToday women do occupy positions in all levels of science, but<br />\nin the higher, more dominant stations it is the men who still<br />\ndominate. In the lab, women are<br />\nresearchers, technicians, and<br /><br />\nsecretaries, but rarely do they<br />\nhead the lab itself. In the medical<br />\nfield, many women have become<br />\nphysicians, but once again men<br />\nare in the majority. Fee pointed<br />\nout a very important factor concerning this inequality. In the<br />\nhealth care profession, women<br />\noccupy a majority of the positions<br />\navailable, even if they are not the<br />\npowerful ones. Dieticians,<br />\nnurses, right down to candy<br />\nstripers are often women, and<br />\nthese people are the ones who<br />\ndirectly care for the patient on a<br />\npersonal level. As Fee sees it, this<br />\nis a main problem for the medical<br />\nprofession. She believes that<br />\nphysicians, mostly men, \"know<br />\nabout the body,\" while the<br />\nothers, mostly women, \"care for<br />\nit.\" Medicine should not be split<br />\nbetween the two, but rather a<br />\ncombination of both.<br />\nThis is where women came in.<br /><br />\nFee cited one male physician who<br />\nbelieved that to improve medicine<br />\ntoday they would have to<br />\n\"change the sex and priorities of<br />\nthe system as a whole.\" \"Body<br />\nengineering\" is not the wave of<br />\nthe future in Fee's eyes. It is the<br />\ntreatment of the body and soul of<br />\nthe patient as one entity. Today<br />\nin general, women work fewer<br />\nhours, receive less pay, participate less in private practice,<br />\nare more involved with the patient and his needs, and basically<br />\nare open to the voice of the life<br />\nwork as opposed to that of<br />\nmedicine.\" These qualities are<br />\nwhat is needed to \"reintegrate the<br />\npatient into the medical encounter.\u2022'<br />\nWith more women in the<br />\nsystem, it would be possible to involve medicine more directly<br />\nwith social problems. For instance, rather than treating only<br /><br />\nthe injuries of a battered wife, it<br />\nwould help fight the cause of the<br />\nproblem, the violent husband.<br />\nTo Hubbard, more feminist<br />\nwomen in science would provide<br />\n\"a different way of looking at<br />\nnature.\" Because \"science is<br />\nknowledge about nature for use\"<br />\na new outlook on the world would<br />\nalter science. Hubbard, a feminist<br />\nherself, believes that women<br />\nwould use science for more<br />\nhumane purposes rather than for<br />\n\"profit, domination, or warfare.\u2014<br />\nShe pointed to the opinion that<br />\nmen are very objective while<br />\nwomen are more subjective. She<br />\ndoes not see this as a problem for<br />\nwomen, but rather as an enhancement.<br />\nShe<br />\nreferred<br />\nto<br />\nprimatology, the study of<br />\nprimates, where there are many<br />\nprominent women in the field.<br />\nFemale primatologists saw many<br /><br />\nadditional and different items in<br />\ntheir study of research data than<br />\nmales did. They did not create<br />\ndifferent \"stories\" from the<br />\ndata, but rather elaborated on<br />\nthem. In Hubbard's point of<br />\nview, a similar one to Fee's,<br />\nwomen have the ability to look at<br />\na part and see how it relates to the<br />\nwhole.<br />\nIn conclusion, what Fee and<br />\nHubbard were stressing was that<br />\nwomen have a significant contribution to make to science and<br />\nmedicine. It may not be better<br />\nthat what exists today, but it is<br />\ndifferent and more encompassing.

The 13-10 victory put<br />\nJHU at the top of the West division of the Middle Atlantic<br />\nConference.<br />\nThe Lady Laxers began the<br />\nmatch unsure of themselves, as<br />\nthey were coming off of two<br />\nMAC defeats last week-a 7-14<br />\nloss to last year's MAC champions and NCAA quarterfinalists,<br />\nHaverford, and an agonizing<br />\n11-12 loss to Franklin and Marshall. The loss to Franklin and<br />\nMarshall had especially upset the<br />\nteam, for they lost the game in the<br />\nlast 90 seconds after having had<br />\na 6-1 lead in the first half.<br /><br />\nHowever, the Lady Jays came<br />\nthrough to triumph over Gettysburg in the most crucial MAC<br />\ngame on their schedule. Coaches<br />\nKatie Glose and Jeanette Ireland<br />\nagreed that the determining factor was \"teamwork all over the<br />\nfield.\"<br />\nThe Gettysburg victory was<br />\nimportant not only for team<br />\nmorale, but also for determining<br />\nwhether Hopkins will play in the<br />\nMAC Championship. If the Lady<br />\nJays can beat Western Maryland<br />\non April 14 and Dickinson on<br />\nApril 16, the two remaining<br />\nWestern division games left on<br />\ntheir schedule, Hopkins would<br />\nthen claim first place in their division and advance to the championship, held on Saturday, May<br />\n2. Head Coach Sally Anderson is<br />\nalso aiming for an invitation to<br />\nthe NCAA tournament, which is<br /><br />\npossible if Hopkins wins the rest<br />\nof their games.<br />\nAnderson credits the superior<br />\ngoalkeeping of Laura Porter and<br />\nJackie Fatula as one reason for<br />\nthe marked improvement in this<br />\nyear's team. (Last year's team<br />\nhad a humiliating 5-24 fall to Gettysburg.) Despite their relative inexperience in lacrosse, both<br />\ngoalkeepers are averaging 50 percent in saves, one of the many<br />\nstatistics up from last year. According to Coach Anderson,\"We<br />\nare much stronger than last year,<br />\nOn the field, Erika Feller has<br />\nbeen the fulcrum of the defense<br />\nat cover point. She has been very<br />\nconsistent and very strong. Kacie<br />\nWhite has also been a big asset to<br />\nthe defense. She plays a very persistent defensive wing. She has<br />\nspeed and works hard.\" Offensively, the high scorers are Alice<br /><br />\nCollins, who is averaging almost<br />\nfive goals per game; and captain<br />\nHeather Klink, who leads the<br />\nteam in assists with 20.<br />\nThe win over Gettysburg raised the Lady Laxers' record to 4<br />\nwins and 2 losses. Victories<br />\nbefore spring break included a<br />\n15-1 Goucher smear, a 16-2<br />\nthrashing of Hood College, and<br />\na 20-4 annihilation of MAC opponent Washington College. The<br />\nsquad also did very well in their<br />\npre-season scrimmages and at<br />\ntheir opening tournament at<br /><br />\nHollands College, in which<br />\nHopkins won 7 of their 8 games<br />\nagainst other teams in the South<br />\nRegion.<br />\nAfter facing Notre Dame on<br />\nThursday, April 9, the team then<br />\ntravels to Widener on Saturday<br />\nand Western Maryland on Tuesday.
