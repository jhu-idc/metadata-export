Baker, treasurer of the<br />\ncommittee whose purpose it is to raise a fund<br />\nfor a memorial to the late Johns Hopkins,<br />\nreports satisfactory progress in this work.<br />\nA guarantee fund of about $7,000 has already been raised. This, without any further subscriptions, would assure such a testimonial as those participating in the movement feel would, to some extent, at least,<br />\nfittingly commemorate the Baltimore philanthropist. It is not sufficient, however, in the<br />\nopinion of those having the matter in charge,<br />\nto give such a monument as was intended<br />\nat the outset of this movement. It was anticipated that at least $15,000 would be required ,and it is the aim of the committee to<br />\nrealize this sum.<br />\nWhen the limit is reached a meeting of<br />\nthe subscribers will probably be called for<br />\na general consultation as to the form the<br />\nmemorial should take. Sculptors will be<br />\ninvited to submit plans and the city officials<br />\nwill be consulted as to the most suitable location.<br />\nIt has been tentatively suggested that it<br />\nbe a drinking fountain of handsome design,<br />\neither on Exchange Place or Hopkins Place.<br />\nIn the first named locality most of Mr. Hopkins' business life was spent, while the last<br />\nwas named in his honor by the city. Others<br />\nthink a statute of the philanthropist in some<br />\nprominent uptown section would be a more<br />\nsuitable recognition.<br />\nThese are all matters in the future, however.<br />\n\"The first thing is to collect the needed<br />\nfund,\" said Mr. Baker. \"With this in hand,<br />\nthe other questions should not cause any<br />\ngreat conflict of opinion or delay in execution.\"<br />\nIn furtherance of the plan a circular letter has been sent to as many business men<br />\nas possible and other citizens likely to take<br />\nan interest in this project.<br />\n\"A feeling exists in Baltimore, we are led<br />\nto believe,\" it says, \"that the inestimable<br />\nboon conferred upon the city by the Johns<br />\nHopkins Hospital and the Johns Hopkins<br />\nUniversity should be recognized by some<br />\nsuitable memorial to the founder, a memorial<br />\n<br />\nerected by the voluntary contributions of<br />\nthe people. With a view to ascertaining the<br />\nstrength of this sentiment, the Municipal Art<br />\nSociety some months ago opened a subscription list for such a memorial. The exact<br />\nform and location of the memorial are to be<br />\nleft to the judgment of a special committee<br />\nto be appointed after requisite funds are in<br />\nhand. The small fund in hand, of course,<br />\nmakes the project feasible, but it is felt that<br />\nit would be ungenerous on the part of Baltimoreans to fail to erect to the memory of<br />\nJohns Hopkins something much more imposing than the smaller sum would procure.\"<br />\nnotable gathering of university men<br />\ntook place last Saturday night, when<br />\nthe Hopkins alumni now living in<br />\nVirginia gathered to meet Dr. Remsen at a<br />\nbanquet at Richmond, Va. There are more<br />\nthan 55 old Hopkins alumni now in that<br />\nState.<br />\nA committee composed of Dr. W. L. Foushee, of Richmond; Dr. Albert Lefevre, of<br />\nCharlottesville; Dr. J. H. Latane, of Lexington, and Prof. Hall Canter, of Ashland, with<br />\nthe first named as chairman, worked zealousyl for the promotion of a Johns Hopkins<br />\nAlumni Association of Virginia. Dr. Remsen made the princpal address, while Dr. E.<br />\nA. Alderman, who is one of the few who have<br />\never received LL. D. from the Hopkins; Dr.<br />\nJ. M. Page and Dr. Leslie Hall, also spoke.<br />\n<br />\nA<br />\n<br />\nNE of the best and jolliest of<br />\nthe Musical Clubs' trips took<br />\nplace lately, when a dozen picked<br />\nmen of the Glee Club went over to<br />\nWashington to participate in, and incidentally sing, at the second annual banquet of<br />\nthe University Club of Washington. Over<br />\nfive hundred sat down to the dinner, which<br />\nwas a mighty good one, and the Glee Club<br />\ncovered themselves and the University with<br />\nglory by rendering selections between the<br />\nacts. At about 12 o'clock the speeches began, and no less important men than President Wilson of Princeton, Speaker Cannon,<br />\nSecretary of Agriculture Wilson and others,<br />\nresponded to the toasts,<br />\n<br />\n0<br />\n<br />\n\fTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\nAfter the banquet the men went to the University Club house, which was put at their<br />\ndisposal (along with the bar). After a rousing time the men caught the 3 o'clock train,<br />\nand got home\u2014.<br />\nWell, everybody had a great time and we<br />\nhope the University Club will extend another<br />\ninvitation next year.<br />\nHE Athletic Association has passed a<br />\nmotion to the effect that hereafter all<br />\nbusiness transacted in its board meetings be given to the student body through<br />\nthe columns of the NEWS-LETTER. The cause<br />\n<br />\nT<br />\n<br />\n3<br />\n<br />\nfor this action has probably been the almost<br />\ngeneral discontent expressed by the student<br />\nbody concerning the board's decisions regarding the football team, and the Asssociation feels, and probably rightly, that the<br />\n.discontent would not have assumed so much<br />\nimportance had all of the facts of the case<br />\nbeen brought to the attention of the student<br />\nWe believe that the present plan<br />\nbody.<br />\nthat has been adopted is a good one, as<br />\nhereafter the student body will have more<br />\nknowledge of what is being done by the<br />\nAssociation, and whatever criticism it sees<br />\nfit to make will be more just.<br />\n<br />\nThe Raving.<br />\nOnce upon a morning dreary, when my eyes were weak and bleary,<br />\nOver many a taint of curious drink tabooed by law;<br />\nWhile I nodded, ice-towels wrapping 'bout my head there came a tapping,<br />\nAs of someone gently slapping\u2014slapping bricks against my door.<br />\n\"'Tis some Creditor,\" I muttered, \"tapping at my chamber door\u2014<br />\nOnly this and nothing more.\"<br />\nAh, distinctly I remember, it was in the bleak December,<br />\nAnd eaeh separate crying member sought its post upon the floor.<br />\nSadly then I mourned the sorrow--madly I had sought to borrow<br />\nFrom my friends until the morrow\u2014money for this Creditor\u2014<br />\nFor this irate man of bill-heads, whom the world calls Creditor\u2014<br />\nShameless wretch for evermore.<br />\nThus I sat engaged in guessing, but no syllable expressing<br />\nTo the wretch whose fiery language burned more brightly as he swore;<br />\nThis and more, I sat divining, with my head at ease reclining<br />\nOn the cold towel's icy lining that the ice was melting o'er,<br />\nBut whose icy dampened lining with the ice still melting o'er,<br />\nShall you guess, ah, nevermore!<br />\nThen methought, the air grew denser, perfumed by my unseen censor<br />\nSprung from Creditor whose foot-falls thundered on the bare hall floor.<br />\n\"Wretch,\" I cried,\"My pard hath sent thee\u2014by my honor, he hath lent me<br />\nMoney\u2014money and deliv'ranee from my memories, Creditor!<br />\nLaugh, oh laugh, you raw-boned tailor, and forget it, Creditor.\"<br />\nQuoth the tailor, \"Nevermore.\"<br />\nBut the tailor, ever knitting, still is sitting, still is sitting,<br />\nO'er the pallid busted debtor behind some other chamber door;<br />\nAnd his eyes have all the gleaming, of a tailor that is scheeming,<br />\nAnd the sunlight o'er him beaming, throws his shadow on the floor;<br />\nAnd my fears for that grim shadow that lies floating on the floor<br />\nShall be lifted\u2014nevermore!<br />\n<br />\n\f4<br />\n<br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\n<br />\nOur Thirtieth Anniversary.<br />\nHE exercises to commemorate the<br />\nthirtieth anniversary of the University were held in McCoy Hall<br />\non February 22. The University has<br />\nnever had a more successful celebration. The speeches of Dr. Lewellys Barker<br />\nand Mr. Bonaparte were most interesting,<br />\nas they both treated of live topics of the day.<br />\nMr. Bonaparte's remarks about modern naval<br />\nwarfare were especially interesting as coming from the head of the Naval Department.<br />\nDr. Remsen announced the presentation of<br />\nan advance copy of University records, compiled by Dr. Gilman. A bust of Dr. Osler<br />\nwas then unveiled. This likeness, by a Baltimorean named Hans Schuler, will be a very<br />\nvaluable addition to the University's collection of busts.<br />\nThe music was rendered by an orchestra<br />\nof twenty-six pieces, led by Mr. Edwin Turnbull, and a part of the Glee Club sang the<br />\n\"University Ode\" and the \"Star-Spangled<br />\nBanner.\"<br />\nA marked improvement over the last celebration was shown in the seating arrangements. Last year, most of the undergraduates were unable to get seats; but this year<br />\nall the students were provided for.<br />\nSecretary Bonaparte's address was an<br />\nearnest appeal for a strong navy as one of<br />\nthe best means of maintaining peace.<br />\nHis plea was not only for public approval<br />\nof the appropriations to buy the ships and<br />\nguns, but for fair and intelligent criticism,<br />\nand last, but far from least, for sympathy<br />\nand for proper treatment of the men who<br />\nman the guns. He began by quoting Washington's speech to Congress when it first assembled after his second election to the Presidency:<br />\n\"' I cannot recommend to your notice<br />\nmeasures for the fulfillment of our duties to<br />\nthe rest of the world without again pressing<br />\nupon you the necessity of placing ourselves<br />\nin a condition of complete defense and of<br />\n<br />\nT<br />\n<br />\nexacting from them the fulfillment of their<br />\nduties toward us. The United States Ought<br />\nnot to indulge a persuasion that, contrary to<br />\nthe order of human events, they will forever<br />\nkeep at a distance those painful appeals to<br />\narms with which the history of every other<br />\nnation abounds. There is a rank due to<br />\nthese United States among nations which<br />\nwill be withheld, if not absolutely lost, by<br />\nthe reputation of weakness. If we desire to<br />\navoid insult we must be able to repel it; if<br />\nwe desire to secure peace, one of the most<br />\npowerful instruments of our rising prosperity, it must be known that we are at all times<br />\nready for war.'<br />\n\"He had already often expressed the same<br />\nviews, and he continued to urge them upon<br />\nhis countrymen until the close of his public<br />\nlife,\" said Mr. Bonaparte. \"In this instance<br />\nhis injunction may seem to have been more<br />\nhonored in the breach than in the observance.<br />\nAt first sight, the American people appears<br />\nto have shown its sense of the truth of Washington's words, not by obeying them, but by<br />\ndisregarding them and paying dearly for the<br />\ndisobedience. From our birth as a nation to<br />\nthe present day we have had with us two<br />\nvery undesirable classes of national advisers<br />\non this subject\u2014those who deem it 'enlightened,' or 'humane' or 'Christian' to try to<br />\npersuade themselves and others that, 'contrary to the order of human events,' we will<br />\nor can 'forever keep at a distance those painful appeals to arms with which the history<br />\nof every other nation abounds,' and those<br />\nwho deem it statesmanlike and economical to<br />\nkeep one dollar in the national Treasury, although hoarding it now may mean the spending of ten or a hundred in the near future.<br />\n\"I have said that liberality shown by the<br />\nCongress toward the navy ought to be, as<br />\nit undoubtedly will be, discriminating and<br />\njudicious. This leads me to speak of the<br />\nsecond great need of the navy, which is,<br />\nto my \u2022mind, a thorough and unsparing but<br />\n<br />\n\fTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\n<br />\n1<br />\n<br />\nfair and intelligent criticism. Every person<br />\nin the service, and especially the Secretary,<br />\nas its head, is a legitimate object of perfectly free comment for all the organs of<br />\npublic opinion. If this hurts his feelings he<br />\nmust get used to having them hurt\u2014indeed,<br />\nif he is, even approximately, the right man<br />\nin the right place, he will welcome such<br />\ncriticism, however unpalatable for a moment,<br />\nas a salutary medicine, a valuable aid in his<br />\nappointed work.<br />\n\"But the duty of fair criticism has a negative no less than a positive side. It forbids<br />\nunfair criticism, and criticism is surely unfair<br />\nwhen based on willful misrepresentation or<br />\nvoluntary ignorance of material facts. I<br />\nappeal to decent people to avoid becoming<br />\nunconscious accomplices in what is often systematic calumny by refusing to give credence<br />\nor greater currency to unauthorized reports.<br />\n\"Finally, my friends, the navy needs\u2014<br />\nneeds perhaps more imperatively than aught<br />\nelse--an assurance that the public sympathizes with its work, that the public knows<br />\nand feels its value to the nation.<br />\n\"To recruit our sea service we have never<br />\nused press gangs; we have never had recourse to conscription in any form. We trust<br />\nwith a confidence which the event has hitherto justified to the patriotism and military<br />\nSpirit of our seafaring folk for the additional<br />\nmen we shall need in the event of war.

Practice has been held regularly<br />\nin the cage and the men are anxiously awaiting the time when they will exchange the<br />\ncage for the wide field at Druid Hill Park.<br />\nThe Junior squad held an outdoor practice<br />\nlast Friday, and if the present conditions prevail, regular field work can soon be carried<br />\non. On paper the squad shows up very well.<br />\nAlthough several old men will be missed<br />\nfrom the line-up, the majority of last year's<br />\nmen are back and exhibit a marked improvement over their last year's form.<br />\nOf the old defense, F. Blanck, Schmeisser,<br />\nand Morse will not be seen in the line-up this<br />\nyear, while in the attack the only men missing are Chambers and Strobhar. The loss<br />\nof these men will be keenly felt, but if reports can be credited, Swarthmore has suffered even more than we have.<br />\nIn the practice games thus far held in the<br />\ncage, several changes in positions have been<br />\nnoticed, and as the men are still being shifted<br />\nabout no definite line-up for the initial game<br />\ncan be prophesied with any degree of certainty.<br />\nThe men who have been worked regularly<br />\nat in-home are Armstrong, of last year's<br />\nsquad, and Frank, captain of the Freshman<br />\n<br />\nteam. Armstrong seems stronger and quicker<br />\nthan he was last year. His stick work is<br />\nundoubtedly improved and he has acquired<br />\na snap and enthusiasm which he did not seem<br />\nto have toward the end of last season. Frank<br />\nis certainly a find, and if he continues as he<br />\nhas begun he may reasonably hope to land a<br />\nplace on the 'Varsity. The position of outhome lies between the two candidates for<br />\nin-home and Knipp, one of last year's subs,<br />\nwho is captain of the Junior twelve. He has<br />\ngreatly improved in leg work, and this was<br />\nhis principal handicap last year. His improvement in this line, coupled with his excellent stick work and judgment, is at present delighting the coaches. Several new<br />\nmen are being used at first attack, but not<br />\nmuch can be said for or against their ability<br />\nuntil the squad gets out of doors and they<br />\nhave a chance to prove their worth in the<br />\nopen. Hudgins is back in his old time form,<br />\nand generally fills in at 2nd or 3rd attack.<br />\nThird attack will undoubtedly be filled by<br />\nDill, last year's captain, but he has not<br />\nplayed that position in the practices, preferring rather to let the new men get the experience. Breyer of the Freshman class has<br />\ndone well in this position, but he is closely<br />\npushed by Wegefarth, also of '08. Tough,<br />\nfully recovered from the injury which he received in the Harvard game of last year, will<br />\nno doubt be seen again at center.<br />\nMacSherry is back again at 3rd defense,<br />\nand with the experience gained last year<br />\nshould prove much more efficient than for-<br />\n<br />\n\fTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\nmerly. Raleigh, who played second attack<br />\ntoward the close of last season, promises to<br />\nmake a strong bid for one of the defense<br />\nPositions, as does Erlanger, who has been<br />\nchanged over from the attack.<br />\nCaptain Meyer will be seen in one of the<br />\nClose defense positions, and Harry Schmeisser, who is working for point, seems likely<br />\nto make good. Last, but not least, Walter<br />\nBlanck will be back at goal. In fact, no one<br />\nelse is seeking to rival him.<br />\nIn the squad are many new men, the most<br />\nPromising of whom are Chesney, Mertie,<br />\nBranham and Mathias. All that is needed<br />\nnow to win the championship is hard work,<br />\nnot only on the part of the lacrosse squad,<br />\nbut also on the part of the undergraduate<br />\nbody as a whole. There is no reason why<br />\nthe lacrosse team should not be supported as<br />\nwell as the football team. Let the students<br />\nget together and \"root\" for the team at each<br />\nand every game.<br />\n<br />\nY. M. C.

Now \"Lanky\" was<br />\nthe thin, over-grown off-shoot of Barnville's<br />\nhardest drinker, and possessed arms and legs<br />\nwhich contrasted painfully with his shrunken<br />\nclothes and the limitations of his brain. The<br />\nboy was weak-minded, his mania being a<br />\npassion for planning and executing the most<br />\ndaring amusements for the children of Barnville's voters, a passion which only the Sunday before had caused consternation among<br />\nthe worshippers when Lanky, at the head<br />\nof a howling tribe of \"Injuns,\" had led a<br />\n\"raid\" on the sacred edifice while a baptism<br />\nwas in progress.<br />\nThe memory was still fresh in Hike's mind<br />\nas he wrapped up the powder.<br />\n\"Say, look-a-here, what-a-you goin' to do<br />\nwith that ar powder?\" Hike asked, looking<br />\nnarrowly at the boy.<br />\n\"Shootin', I spec\" answered Lanky as he<br />\nshuffled out.<br />\n\"That ar boy's gittin' loonier than a<br />\nhyener,\" grumbled Hike, whose ideas of<br />\nhyenas were sincere but vague. \"Still, 'taint<br />\nnone ef my business what he's up to,\" he<br />\n<br />\nH<br />\n<br />\nadded, with a lack of curiosity usually<br />\nforeign to him.<br />\nLanky continued up the road for a short<br />\ndistance until he came to a stretch of woods<br />\nskirting the pike. Then he stopped and<br />\ncautiously looking about him, turned swiftly<br />\ninto the woods. He had gone but a few<br />\nsteps when the figure of another boy, Joe<br />\nHanson, appeared suddenly from behind a<br />\ntree. A few mystic signs were exchanged<br />\nsolemnly, and then Lanky asked impressively:<br />\n\"Is the Avengin' Anerkists tergether<br />\nyet?\"<br />\n\"Yes, Chief,\" answered the younger boy,<br />\nshifting uneasily from one bare foot to the<br />\nother, and then in a more anxious tone he<br />\nasked, \"Say, Lank, did yer git it?\"<br />\n\"Git what?\" demanded the chieftain with<br />\ndignified indifference.<br />\n\"The powder.\"<br />\n\"I did, verily.\"<br />\nThe pair moved on into the woods, following a shallow brook until they came to a<br />\nsecluded spot where stood the tumbled remains of a mill. On the banks of the millrace sat four other bare-foot youngsters,<br />\nranging in age from about eleven years to<br />\nfourteen.<br />\n\"Men, and feller anerkists,\" began the<br />\nchief, laying beside him the package of powder, the time hes corn' fer our revenge! Be<br />\nye all ready?\"<br />\nThe general wording of this sentence might<br />\nhave been traced to the leaves of the dime<br />\nnovel protruding from Lanky's hip-pocket,<br />\nbut it had the desired effect. A half audible<br />\nresponse resulted.<br />\n\"Ma, she give me a awful lickin\"bout<br />\nthet raid Sunday. She said she didn't know<br />\nas I could come out ternight,\" ventured one<br />\nof the \"anerkists,\" wriggling his toes uncomfortably.<br />\n.\"Huh,\" sniffed the leader, whose ideas of<br />\nmothers were not born of any remembrance<br />\n<br />\n\fTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\nof his own, \"You're a beaut anerkist, you<br />\nare, Sammy Bean, gittin' skeered already.<br />\nEf you was a-goin' to drop out, what did<br />\nyou sign the Bloody Oath fer?\"<br />\n\"I ain't no more skeered than you are,<br />\nLanky Booze Who said I was a-goin ter<br />\ndrop out? I was jest a-remindin' you in case<br />\nI didn't turn up ternight.\"<br />\n\"Feller anerkists,\" began Lanky afresh,<br />\n\"we has been done dirty mean by Cap'n<br />\nBoaster fer the last time.

Well, we've all sweared ter fix him.<br />\nLet's git ready.\"<br />\nSome one of the \"anerkists\" produced an<br />\nold hot-water bag, which Lanky filled with<br />\nhis powder, and to which he attached a long,<br />\ngrease-dipped fuse. When these simple preparations were completed, Lanky dismissed<br />\nthe \"Avengin' Anerkists\" with instructions<br />\nto meet him at the church after supper.<br />\n* * *<br />\nAll Barnville was assembled around the<br />\nplatform outside the school-house, when Captain Boaster rose to make his address. His<br />\nample figure was clothed in a dress coat and<br />\nvest of ancient cut, steel striped trousers, a<br />\nred tie, and a glorious white stiff shirt, specially iron for the occasion, which creaked and<br />\ncracked painfully as the orator spoke.<br />\nParting with an evident nervousness from<br />\nhis re-assuring quid, and after a reviving use<br />\nof his bandana handkerchief, he launched<br />\nforth.<br />\n\"Feller citizens of the town of Barnville<br />\nCross Roads, you hey come tergither this<br />\ngrand night ter celebrate one ef the best<br />\nthings ef hist'ry\u2014the signin' ef the Declaration ef Independence. I ain't no orator es<br />\nBrutus was, but ev'ry time I think of George<br />\nWashington, I am filled with pride fer my<br />\ncountry, en my soul is raised\u2014\"<br />\nA muffled roar closed the sentence, and,<br />\nas if to suit his actions to his utterance, the<br />\n<br />\n11<br />\n<br />\nCaptain's bodily and spirtual self rose into<br />\nthe air in a most inglorious manner. In fact<br />\nthe entire platform was assisting in the soulraising process.<br />\nAt first the audience was too terror-stricken<br />\ntO move, and then with a common impulse,<br />\nrushed to where the orator lay. Luckily,<br />\nthe only injury which he received was to<br />\nhis shirtfront, which, bolstering up his disheveled beard, was smeared and blackened<br />\nbeyond the possible succor of Mrs. Boaster's<br />\nwash-tubs.<br />\nThe \"Avengin' Anerkists were avenged.<br />\n<br />\nOBITUARY.<br />\nR. Frederick W. Hilbert, a graduate student in the Economic<br />\nDepartment, died suddenly on<br />\na Sturday, February 17. His funeral<br />\ntook place on the following Tuesday.

After taking the degree of Master of Arts at RandolphMacon, he bought out the interest in the<br />\nFranklin University School for Boys, where,<br />\nfor several years, he conducted a successful<br />\npreparatory school.

Baker, treasurer of the<br />\ncommittee whose purpose it is to raise a fund<br />\nfor a memorial to the late Johns Hopkins,<br />\nreports satisfactory progress in this work.<br />\nA guarantee fund of about $7,000 has already been raised. This, without any further subscriptions, would assure such a testimonial as those participating in the movement feel would, to some extent, at least,<br />\nfittingly commemorate the Baltimore philanthropist. It is not sufficient, however, in the<br />\nopinion of those having the matter in charge,<br />\nto give such a monument as was intended<br />\nat the outset of this movement. It was anticipated that at least $15,000 would be required ,and it is the aim of the committee to<br />\nrealize this sum.<br />\nWhen the limit is reached a meeting of<br />\nthe subscribers will probably be called for<br />\na general consultation as to the form the<br />\nmemorial should take. Sculptors will be<br />\ninvited to submit plans and the city officials<br />\nwill be consulted as to the most suitable location.<br />\nIt has been tentatively suggested that it<br />\nbe a drinking fountain of handsome design,<br />\neither on Exchange Place or Hopkins Place.<br />\nIn the first named locality most of Mr. Hopkins' business life was spent, while the last<br />\nwas named in his honor by the city. Others<br />\nthink a statute of the philanthropist in some<br />\nprominent uptown section would be a more<br />\nsuitable recognition.<br />\nThese are all matters in the future, however.<br />\n\"The first thing is to collect the needed<br />\nfund,\" said Mr. Baker. \"With this in hand,<br />\nthe other questions should not cause any<br />\ngreat conflict of opinion or delay in execution.\"<br />\nIn furtherance of the plan a circular letter has been sent to as many business men<br />\nas possible and other citizens likely to take<br />\nan interest in this project.<br />\n\"A feeling exists in Baltimore, we are led<br />\nto believe,\" it says, \"that the inestimable<br />\nboon conferred upon the city by the Johns<br />\nHopkins Hospital and the Johns Hopkins<br />\nUniversity should be recognized by some<br />\nsuitable memorial to the founder, a memorial<br /><br />\nerected by the voluntary contributions of<br />\nthe people. With a view to ascertaining the<br />\nstrength of this sentiment, the Municipal Art<br />\nSociety some months ago opened a subscription list for such a memorial. The exact<br />\nform and location of the memorial are to be<br />\nleft to the judgment of a special committee<br />\nto be appointed after requisite funds are in<br />\nhand. The small fund in hand, of course,<br />\nmakes the project feasible, but it is felt that<br />\nit would be ungenerous on the part of Baltimoreans to fail to erect to the memory of<br />\nJohns Hopkins something much more imposing than the smaller sum would procure.\"<br />\nnotable gathering of university men<br />\ntook place last Saturday night, when<br />\nthe Hopkins alumni now living in<br />\nVirginia gathered to meet Dr. Remsen at a<br />\nbanquet at Richmond, Va. There are more<br />\nthan 55 old Hopkins alumni now in that<br />\nState.<br />\nA committee composed of Dr. W. L. Foushee, of Richmond; Dr. Albert Lefevre, of<br />\nCharlottesville; Dr. J. H. Latane, of Lexington, and Prof. Hall Canter, of Ashland, with<br />\nthe first named as chairman, worked zealousyl for the promotion of a Johns Hopkins<br />\nAlumni Association of Virginia. Dr. Remsen made the princpal address, while Dr. E.<br />\nA. Alderman, who is one of the few who have<br />\never received LL. D. from the Hopkins; Dr.<br />\nJ. M. Page and Dr. Leslie Hall, also spoke.<br /><br />\nA<br /><br />\nNE of the best and jolliest of<br />\nthe Musical Clubs' trips took<br />\nplace lately, when a dozen picked<br />\nmen of the Glee Club went over to<br />\nWashington to participate in, and incidentally sing, at the second annual banquet of<br />\nthe University Club of Washington. Over<br />\nfive hundred sat down to the dinner, which<br />\nwas a mighty good one, and the Glee Club<br />\ncovered themselves and the University with<br />\nglory by rendering selections between the<br />\nacts. At about 12 o'clock the speeches began, and no less important men than President Wilson of Princeton, Speaker Cannon,<br />\nSecretary of Agriculture Wilson and others,<br />\nresponded to the toasts,<br /><br />\n0<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\nAfter the banquet the men went to the University Club house, which was put at their<br />\ndisposal (along with the bar).

The cause<br /><br />\nT<br /><br />\n3<br /><br />\nfor this action has probably been the almost<br />\ngeneral discontent expressed by the student<br />\nbody concerning the board's decisions regarding the football team, and the Asssociation feels, and probably rightly, that the<br />\n.discontent would not have assumed so much<br />\nimportance had all of the facts of the case<br />\nbeen brought to the attention of the student<br />\nWe believe that the present plan<br />\nbody.<br />\nthat has been adopted is a good one, as<br />\nhereafter the student body will have more<br />\nknowledge of what is being done by the<br />\nAssociation, and whatever criticism it sees<br />\nfit to make will be more just.<br /><br />\nThe Raving.<br />\nOnce upon a morning dreary, when my eyes were weak and bleary,<br />\nOver many a taint of curious drink tabooed by law;<br />\nWhile I nodded, ice-towels wrapping 'bout my head there came a tapping,<br />\nAs of someone gently slapping\u2014slapping bricks against my door.<br />\n\"'Tis some Creditor,\" I muttered, \"tapping at my chamber door\u2014<br />\nOnly this and nothing more.\"<br />\nAh, distinctly I remember, it was in the bleak December,<br />\nAnd eaeh separate crying member sought its post upon the floor.<br />\nSadly then I mourned the sorrow--madly I had sought to borrow<br />\nFrom my friends until the morrow\u2014money for this Creditor\u2014<br />\nFor this irate man of bill-heads, whom the world calls Creditor\u2014<br />\nShameless wretch for evermore.<br />\nThus I sat engaged in guessing, but no syllable expressing<br />\nTo the wretch whose fiery language burned more brightly as he swore;<br />\nThis and more, I sat divining, with my head at ease reclining<br />\nOn the cold towel's icy lining that the ice was melting o'er,<br />\nBut whose icy dampened lining with the ice still melting o'er,<br />\nShall you guess, ah, nevermore!<br />\nThen methought, the air grew denser, perfumed by my unseen censor<br />\nSprung from Creditor whose foot-falls thundered on the bare hall floor.<br />\n\"Wretch,\" I cried,\"My pard hath sent thee\u2014by my honor, he hath lent me<br />\nMoney\u2014money and deliv'ranee from my memories, Creditor!<br />\nLaugh, oh laugh, you raw-boned tailor, and forget it, Creditor.\"<br />\nQuoth the tailor, \"Nevermore.\"<br />\nBut the tailor, ever knitting, still is sitting, still is sitting,<br />\nO'er the pallid busted debtor behind some other chamber door;<br />\nAnd his eyes have all the gleaming, of a tailor that is scheeming,<br />\nAnd the sunlight o'er him beaming, throws his shadow on the floor;<br />\nAnd my fears for that grim shadow that lies floating on the floor<br />\nShall be lifted\u2014nevermore!<br /><br />\n4<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br /><br />\nOur Thirtieth Anniversary.<br />\nHE exercises to commemorate the<br />\nthirtieth anniversary of the University were held in McCoy Hall<br />\non February 22. The University has<br />\nnever had a more successful celebration. The speeches of Dr. Lewellys Barker<br />\nand Mr. Bonaparte were most interesting,<br />\nas they both treated of live topics of the day.<br />\nMr. Bonaparte's remarks about modern naval<br />\nwarfare were especially interesting as coming from the head of the Naval Department.<br />\nDr. Remsen announced the presentation of<br />\nan advance copy of University records, compiled by Dr. Gilman. A bust of Dr. Osler<br />\nwas then unveiled. This likeness, by a Baltimorean named Hans Schuler, will be a very<br />\nvaluable addition to the University's collection of busts.<br />\nThe music was rendered by an orchestra<br />\nof twenty-six pieces, led by Mr. Edwin Turnbull, and a part of the Glee Club sang the<br />\n\"University Ode\" and the \"Star-Spangled<br />\nBanner.\"<br />\nA marked improvement over the last celebration was shown in the seating arrangements. Last year, most of the undergraduates were unable to get seats; but this year<br />\nall the students were provided for.<br />\nSecretary Bonaparte's address was an<br />\nearnest appeal for a strong navy as one of<br />\nthe best means of maintaining peace.<br />\nHis plea was not only for public approval<br />\nof the appropriations to buy the ships and<br />\nguns, but for fair and intelligent criticism,<br />\nand last, but far from least, for sympathy<br />\nand for proper treatment of the men who<br />\nman the guns. He began by quoting Washington's speech to Congress when it first assembled after his second election to the Presidency:<br />\n\"' I cannot recommend to your notice<br />\nmeasures for the fulfillment of our duties to<br />\nthe rest of the world without again pressing<br />\nupon you the necessity of placing ourselves<br />\nin a condition of complete defense and of<br /><br />\nT<br /><br />\nexacting from them the fulfillment of their<br />\nduties toward us. The United States Ought<br />\nnot to indulge a persuasion that, contrary to<br />\nthe order of human events, they will forever<br />\nkeep at a distance those painful appeals to<br />\narms with which the history of every other<br />\nnation abounds. There is a rank due to<br />\nthese United States among nations which<br />\nwill be withheld, if not absolutely lost, by<br />\nthe reputation of weakness. If we desire to<br />\navoid insult we must be able to repel it; if<br />\nwe desire to secure peace, one of the most<br />\npowerful instruments of our rising prosperity, it must be known that we are at all times<br />\nready for war.'<br />\n\"He had already often expressed the same<br />\nviews, and he continued to urge them upon<br />\nhis countrymen until the close of his public<br />\nlife,\" said Mr. Bonaparte. \"In this instance<br />\nhis injunction may seem to have been more<br />\nhonored in the breach than in the observance.<br />\nAt first sight, the American people appears<br />\nto have shown its sense of the truth of Washington's words, not by obeying them, but by<br />\ndisregarding them and paying dearly for the<br />\ndisobedience. From our birth as a nation to<br />\nthe present day we have had with us two<br />\nvery undesirable classes of national advisers<br />\non this subject\u2014those who deem it 'enlightened,' or 'humane' or 'Christian' to try to<br />\npersuade themselves and others that, 'contrary to the order of human events,' we will<br />\nor can 'forever keep at a distance those painful appeals to arms with which the history<br />\nof every other nation abounds,' and those<br />\nwho deem it statesmanlike and economical to<br />\nkeep one dollar in the national Treasury, although hoarding it now may mean the spending of ten or a hundred in the near future.<br />\n\"I have said that liberality shown by the<br />\nCongress toward the navy ought to be, as<br />\nit undoubtedly will be, discriminating and<br />\njudicious. This leads me to speak of the<br />\nsecond great need of the navy, which is,<br />\nto my \u2022mind, a thorough and unsparing but<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br /><br />\n1<br /><br />\nfair and intelligent criticism. Every person<br />\nin the service, and especially the Secretary,<br />\nas its head, is a legitimate object of perfectly free comment for all the organs of<br />\npublic opinion. If this hurts his feelings he<br />\nmust get used to having them hurt\u2014indeed,<br />\nif he is, even approximately, the right man<br />\nin the right place, he will welcome such<br />\ncriticism, however unpalatable for a moment,<br />\nas a salutary medicine, a valuable aid in his<br />\nappointed work.<br />\n\"But the duty of fair criticism has a negative no less than a positive side. It forbids<br />\nunfair criticism, and criticism is surely unfair<br />\nwhen based on willful misrepresentation or<br />\nvoluntary ignorance of material facts. I<br />\nappeal to decent people to avoid becoming<br />\nunconscious accomplices in what is often systematic calumny by refusing to give credence<br />\nor greater currency to unauthorized reports.<br />\n\"Finally, my friends, the navy needs\u2014<br />\nneeds perhaps more imperatively than aught<br />\nelse--an assurance that the public sympathizes with its work, that the public knows<br />\nand feels its value to the nation.<br />\n\"To recruit our sea service we have never<br />\nused press gangs; we have never had recourse to conscription in any form. We trust<br />\nwith a confidence which the event has hitherto justified to the patriotism and military<br />\nSpirit of our seafaring folk for the additional<br />\nmen we shall need in the event of war. In<br />\ntime of peace, however, we must make our<br />\nservice attractive to men such as we shall<br />\nneed in war if we hope for trained sailors<br />\nwhen that time shall come.<br />\n\"Doubtless this means a heavy expense,<br />\nfor we must pay, and we do pay, such men<br />\nliberally; but it means something besides expense. The men we seek, and of late have<br />\nin large measure secured, will not alienate<br />\ntheir liberties, will not subject themselves<br />\nto the restraints of naval discipline, unless<br />\nthey feel that as sailors they can retain their<br />\nself-respect and earn the esteem of their<br />\nfellow-Americans.<br />\n\"To treat these men as outcasts when they<br />\ncome ashore is to cripple our ships more<br /><br />\n0<br /><br />\nsurely than if their guns were disabled or<br />\ntheir engines put out of gear. In some sort<br />\nour trained seamen resemble our smokeless<br />\npowder, we must have enough on hand or<br />\nsubject to call when war begins to serve our<br />\npurpose, for the war may well end before we<br />\ncan manufacture more.<br />\n\"I have spoken thus earnestly of that<br />\nbranch of the public service for the moment<br />\ncommitted to my charge because I feel<br />\nstrongly its paramount, its vital, moment to<br />\nthe nation's safety and dignity, usefulness<br />\nand greatness.<br />\n\"What kind of nation, if a nation at all,<br />\nwe should have been now if George Washington had not been born 174 years ago can<br />\nbe matter of conjecture only; but we may be<br />\nabsolutely certain that, to become or remain<br />\na nation worthy of his labors and his memory<br />\n\u2014a nation he would be glad and proud to<br />\nown were he again among us\u2014we must become, if we are not now\u2014and, if we are, we<br />\nmust ever remain\u2014a nation glad and proud<br />\nto maintain and cherish a worthy navy.\"<br />\nTHE POWER BEHIND.<br />\n'Tis moonlight on the side-walk,<br />\nThe air is full of frost,<br />\nThis weather fine and bracing<br />\nShould surely not be lost.<br />\nWith this, I'm sure that Horace<br />\nWould take exception not,<br />\nAnd so for sake of Horace,<br />\nI'll go out for a trot.<br />\nHASH.<br />\nLady keeps a boarding house, and<br />\nAlso keeps a cat;<br />\nOf boarders, too,<br />\nShe has a few, and<br />\nNone of them are fat.<br />\nReligious is this lady, and<br />\nReligious is her cat;<br />\nWith heavenly face<br />\nShe says the grace, while<br />\nPussy skins the cat,<br /><br />\n6<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br /><br />\nAROUND THE CORRIDORS.<br /><br />\nALUMNI.<br /><br />\nThe Junior Hulalbaloo elections resulted<br />\nas follows:<br />\nEditor-in-Chief\u2014Karl Singewald.<br />\nAssociate Editor\u2014John Holmes.<br />\nBusiness Manager\u2014George Stewart.<br />\nAssociate Manager\u2014Wallis Giffen.<br />\nAssociate Manager\u2014David Strouse.<br />\nEditors \u2014 Reynolds, Hunting, Raleigh,<br />\nDistler, Gould, Grauer.<br />\nArt Editor\u2014Walter Meyers.<br />\nAsst.

Practice has been held regularly<br />\nin the cage and the men are anxiously awaiting the time when they will exchange the<br />\ncage for the wide field at Druid Hill Park.<br />\nThe Junior squad held an outdoor practice<br />\nlast Friday, and if the present conditions prevail, regular field work can soon be carried<br />\non. On paper the squad shows up very well.<br />\nAlthough several old men will be missed<br />\nfrom the line-up, the majority of last year's<br />\nmen are back and exhibit a marked improvement over their last year's form.<br />\nOf the old defense, F. Blanck, Schmeisser,<br />\nand Morse will not be seen in the line-up this<br />\nyear, while in the attack the only men missing are Chambers and Strobhar. The loss<br />\nof these men will be keenly felt, but if reports can be credited, Swarthmore has suffered even more than we have.<br />\nIn the practice games thus far held in the<br />\ncage, several changes in positions have been<br />\nnoticed, and as the men are still being shifted<br />\nabout no definite line-up for the initial game<br />\ncan be prophesied with any degree of certainty.<br />\nThe men who have been worked regularly<br />\nat in-home are Armstrong, of last year's<br />\nsquad, and Frank, captain of the Freshman<br /><br />\nteam. Armstrong seems stronger and quicker<br />\nthan he was last year. His stick work is<br />\nundoubtedly improved and he has acquired<br />\na snap and enthusiasm which he did not seem<br />\nto have toward the end of last season. Frank<br />\nis certainly a find, and if he continues as he<br />\nhas begun he may reasonably hope to land a<br />\nplace on the 'Varsity. The position of outhome lies between the two candidates for<br />\nin-home and Knipp, one of last year's subs,<br />\nwho is captain of the Junior twelve. He has<br />\ngreatly improved in leg work, and this was<br />\nhis principal handicap last year. His improvement in this line, coupled with his excellent stick work and judgment, is at present delighting the coaches. Several new<br />\nmen are being used at first attack, but not<br />\nmuch can be said for or against their ability<br />\nuntil the squad gets out of doors and they<br />\nhave a chance to prove their worth in the<br />\nopen. Hudgins is back in his old time form,<br />\nand generally fills in at 2nd or 3rd attack.<br />\nThird attack will undoubtedly be filled by<br />\nDill, last year's captain, but he has not<br />\nplayed that position in the practices, preferring rather to let the new men get the experience. Breyer of the Freshman class has<br />\ndone well in this position, but he is closely<br />\npushed by Wegefarth, also of '08. Tough,<br />\nfully recovered from the injury which he received in the Harvard game of last year, will<br />\nno doubt be seen again at center.<br />\nMacSherry is back again at 3rd defense,<br />\nand with the experience gained last year<br />\nshould prove much more efficient than for-<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\nmerly. Raleigh, who played second attack<br />\ntoward the close of last season, promises to<br />\nmake a strong bid for one of the defense<br />\nPositions, as does Erlanger, who has been<br />\nchanged over from the attack.<br />\nCaptain Meyer will be seen in one of the<br />\nClose defense positions, and Harry Schmeisser, who is working for point, seems likely<br />\nto make good. Last, but not least, Walter<br />\nBlanck will be back at goal. In fact, no one<br />\nelse is seeking to rival him.<br />\nIn the squad are many new men, the most<br />\nPromising of whom are Chesney, Mertie,<br />\nBranham and Mathias. All that is needed<br />\nnow to win the championship is hard work,<br />\nnot only on the part of the lacrosse squad,<br />\nbut also on the part of the undergraduate<br />\nbody as a whole. There is no reason why<br />\nthe lacrosse team should not be supported as<br />\nwell as the football team.

All students<br />\nThat 'twill just as certain be,<br />\nFor all love to end in L!<br />\nwho may think of joining the Association<br />\nthis year, should notify the General Secretary before that date.<br />\nA FAT PROPOSITION.<br /><br />\nThere once was a lady named Raft,<br />\nAt whose size most everyone laughed;<br />\n\"Oh, you can't worry me,\"<br />\nShe said with much glee,<br />\n\"Good law, why just think of Taft!\"<br /><br />\nA PROTECTED INDUSTRY.<br />\nShe asked the postman if he feared<br />\nThe night so dark, the howling gale;<br />\n\"Why not at all,\" the postman said,<br />\n\"You see, I have a coat of mail!\"<br /><br />\n10<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br /><br />\nThe Upshot of the Affair.<br />\nEAT and dust\u2014more heat and thicker<br />\ndust\u2014together with a goodly complement of license, liberty and liniment, ushered the noon-hour of a particular<br />\nFourth of July into Barr:wine Cross Roads.<br />\nThe mid-day atmosphere seemed charged<br />\nwith Independence and the flies were busily<br />\nwriting a Declaration on the mouasses barrel<br />\nthat stood in a corner of Hike Smith's store.<br />\nAlready Hike's stock of fireworks had been<br />\ndistributed throughout the country adjacent<br />\nto Barnville Cross Roads, and weary from the<br />\nrush of business, Hike was standing behind<br />\nthe mail window, reading postals and mopping a beaded forehead, so it was with evident irritation that he permitted himself to<br />\nglance up at the figure of \"Lanky\" Bates,<br />\nwho just them shambled loosely into the<br />\nstore.<br />\n\"Kin you let me hey a poun' ef powdor?\"<br />\nLanky drawled out. Now \"Lanky\" was<br />\nthe thin, over-grown off-shoot of Barnville's<br />\nhardest drinker, and possessed arms and legs<br />\nwhich contrasted painfully with his shrunken<br />\nclothes and the limitations of his brain. The<br />\nboy was weak-minded, his mania being a<br />\npassion for planning and executing the most<br />\ndaring amusements for the children of Barnville's voters, a passion which only the Sunday before had caused consternation among<br />\nthe worshippers when Lanky, at the head<br />\nof a howling tribe of \"Injuns,\" had led a<br />\n\"raid\" on the sacred edifice while a baptism<br />\nwas in progress.<br />\nThe memory was still fresh in Hike's mind<br />\nas he wrapped up the powder.<br />\n\"Say, look-a-here, what-a-you goin' to do<br />\nwith that ar powder?\" Hike asked, looking<br />\nnarrowly at the boy.<br />\n\"Shootin', I spec\" answered Lanky as he<br />\nshuffled out.<br />\n\"That ar boy's gittin' loonier than a<br />\nhyener,\" grumbled Hike, whose ideas of<br />\nhyenas were sincere but vague. \"Still, 'taint<br />\nnone ef my business what he's up to,\" he<br /><br />\nH<br /><br />\nadded, with a lack of curiosity usually<br />\nforeign to him.<br />\nLanky continued up the road for a short<br />\ndistance until he came to a stretch of woods<br />\nskirting the pike. Then he stopped and<br />\ncautiously looking about him, turned swiftly<br />\ninto the woods. He had gone but a few<br />\nsteps when the figure of another boy, Joe<br />\nHanson, appeared suddenly from behind a<br />\ntree. A few mystic signs were exchanged<br />\nsolemnly, and then Lanky asked impressively:<br />\n\"Is the Avengin' Anerkists tergether<br />\nyet?\"<br />\n\"Yes, Chief,\" answered the younger boy,<br />\nshifting uneasily from one bare foot to the<br />\nother, and then in a more anxious tone he<br />\nasked, \"Say, Lank, did yer git it?\"<br />\n\"Git what?\" demanded the chieftain with<br />\ndignified indifference.<br />\n\"The powder.\"<br />\n\"I did, verily.\"<br />\nThe pair moved on into the woods, following a shallow brook until they came to a<br />\nsecluded spot where stood the tumbled remains of a mill. On the banks of the millrace sat four other bare-foot youngsters,<br />\nranging in age from about eleven years to<br />\nfourteen.<br />\n\"Men, and feller anerkists,\" began the<br />\nchief, laying beside him the package of powder, the time hes corn' fer our revenge! Be<br />\nye all ready?\"<br />\nThe general wording of this sentence might<br />\nhave been traced to the leaves of the dime<br />\nnovel protruding from Lanky's hip-pocket,<br />\nbut it had the desired effect. A half audible<br />\nresponse resulted.<br />\n\"Ma, she give me a awful lickin\"bout<br />\nthet raid Sunday. She said she didn't know<br />\nas I could come out ternight,\" ventured one<br />\nof the \"anerkists,\" wriggling his toes uncomfortably.<br />\n.\"Huh,\" sniffed the leader, whose ideas of<br />\nmothers were not born of any remembrance<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\nof his own, \"You're a beaut anerkist, you<br />\nare, Sammy Bean, gittin' skeered already.<br />\nEf you was a-goin' to drop out, what did<br />\nyou sign the Bloody Oath fer?\"<br />\n\"I ain't no more skeered than you are,<br />\nLanky Booze Who said I was a-goin ter<br />\ndrop out? I was jest a-remindin' you in case<br />\nI didn't turn up ternight.\"<br />\n\"Feller anerkists,\" began Lanky afresh,<br />\n\"we has been done dirty mean by Cap'n<br />\nBoaster fer the last time. You all know as<br />\nit was him who told on us fer swipin' Squire<br />\nCourt's apples, en gittin' you fellers a lickin'<br />\nfer goin' in swimmin' on Sundays. Yer all<br />\nknow, too, as he his a-goin' ter make a<br />\nspeech at the open-air celebrashun ternight.<br />\nHe thinks he's goin' ter be the hull show,<br />\ntoo. Well, we've all sweared ter fix him.<br />\nLet's git ready.\"<br />\nSome one of the \"anerkists\" produced an<br />\nold hot-water bag, which Lanky filled with<br />\nhis powder, and to which he attached a long,<br />\ngrease-dipped fuse. When these simple preparations were completed, Lanky dismissed<br />\nthe \"Avengin' Anerkists\" with instructions<br />\nto meet him at the church after supper.<br />\n* * *<br />\nAll Barnville was assembled around the<br />\nplatform outside the school-house, when Captain Boaster rose to make his address. His<br />\nample figure was clothed in a dress coat and<br />\nvest of ancient cut, steel striped trousers, a<br />\nred tie, and a glorious white stiff shirt, specially iron for the occasion, which creaked and<br />\ncracked painfully as the orator spoke.<br />\nParting with an evident nervousness from<br />\nhis re-assuring quid, and after a reviving use<br />\nof his bandana handkerchief, he launched<br />\nforth.<br />\n\"Feller citizens of the town of Barnville<br />\nCross Roads, you hey come tergither this<br />\ngrand night ter celebrate one ef the best<br />\nthings ef hist'ry\u2014the signin' ef the Declaration ef Independence. I ain't no orator es<br />\nBrutus was, but ev'ry time I think of George<br />\nWashington, I am filled with pride fer my<br />\ncountry, en my soul is raised\u2014\"<br />\nA muffled roar closed the sentence, and,<br />\nas if to suit his actions to his utterance, the<br /><br />\n11<br /><br />\nCaptain's bodily and spirtual self rose into<br />\nthe air in a most inglorious manner. In fact<br />\nthe entire platform was assisting in the soulraising process.<br />\nAt first the audience was too terror-stricken<br />\ntO move, and then with a common impulse,<br />\nrushed to where the orator lay. Luckily,<br />\nthe only injury which he received was to<br />\nhis shirtfront, which, bolstering up his disheveled beard, was smeared and blackened<br />\nbeyond the possible succor of Mrs. Boaster's<br />\nwash-tubs.<br />\nThe \"Avengin' Anerkists were avenged.<br /><br />\nOBITUARY.<br />\nR.
