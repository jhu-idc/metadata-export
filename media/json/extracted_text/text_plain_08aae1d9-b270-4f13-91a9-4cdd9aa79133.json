Pope's<br />\nfencing team whipped through their curtailed season with an<br />\nunblemished slate and finished 12th nationally, and now the<br />\ntennis squad is continuing the streak.<br />\n<br />\nThe mighty cadets are too deep, too well conditioned, and<br />\nriding too high for the Jays to rebound against, and this column<br />\nfrankly picks Army over the Jays. Five wins in a row and the<br />\nstrength of their 18-8 lacing of the Maryland Lacrosse Club<br />\nmakes the Black Knights the top choice for national honors.<br />\nHowever, if the Jays do get by Army, they'll find a warm<br />\nwelcome for them elsewhere. Maryland and Navy are had enough.<br />\nThrow in Mount Washington for a clincher and you have three<br />\nrough weekends for the Jay fans. We predict Hopkins will lose<br />\nto Army and Maryland but come up for wins against Navy and<br />\nMount Washington. That will leave the Blue with a 3-4 record<br />\nfor the year, and not even the most hopeful Jay fan could envision<br />\na national title with that sort of a record.<br />\nIf Chick Fewster can work that one-point mania out of<br />\nhis starting ten and upset these predictions tomorrow, which<br />\nlooks pretty unlikely at the time of this writing, Hopkins may<br />\npull the surprise of the year and go undefeated the rest of the<br />\nseason.

Five wins in a row and the<br />\nstrength of their 18-8 lacing of the Maryland Lacrosse Club<br />\nmakes the Black Knights the top choice for national honors.<br />\nHowever, if the Jays do get by Army, they'll find a warm<br />\nwelcome for them elsewhere. Maryland and Navy are had enough.<br />\nThrow in Mount Washington for a clincher and you have three<br />\nrough weekends for the Jay fans. We predict Hopkins will lose<br />\nto Army and Maryland but come up for wins against Navy and<br />\nMount Washington.
