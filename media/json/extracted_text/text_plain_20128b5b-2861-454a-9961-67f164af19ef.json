Nevertheless, despite this lack of playing<br />\nstrength, lebell's \"pass-aad-a-prayer\" club split eyen in fourteen<br />\nleague games last year and forced the Buffalo Bills into a playoff for<br />\nthe Eastern division crown.<br />\nThis. record was a brilliant tribute to Isbell's ability as a pro<br />\ncoach. With this improvement in one year, local sports followers<br />\n(including the Colts' Board of Directors) expected a championship<br />\nthis season.<br />\nThere were no grounds for such hopes. Hillenbrand had retired<br />\nfrom football ---Tittle could never be better than in '48 and it was<br />\nnatural that he should slump a bit. No outstanding line reserves had<br />\nbeen brought in to help out Dick Barwegan and \"the thin green line.\"<br />\nWhile the other A.A.C. clubs were lining up last year's college<br />\ngreats, Colt officials sat track and waited for magician Isbell to brew<br />\nthem a championship potion from second-division ingredients.<br />\nWell, Isbell couldn't do it. And it's not likely anyone else could<br />\nhey, either. When the Colts lost their first four starts, eves though<br />\nall four were played away, and at least two leases were due to fumbles<br />\n(something no coach since Adam has been able to avoid), the moanhag began long and loud.<br />\nOn the Saturday morning after the Colts' fourth loss, 35-7 to<br />\nChicago, a directors' meeting was held, to which local sports editors<br />\nPaul Menton, Jesse Linthicutu, and Roger Pippen were invited. Linthicum and Pippen attended, Menton did not; the opinions of the first<br />\ntwo were asked and a tentative plan to fire Isbell was discussed. Walter Driskill, at that time President and General Manager of the organization, was asked if he would accept the coaching job. Driskill<br />\nrecommended the retention of Isbell, put said he would take the position if necessary.<br />\nIsbell, in the meantime, had caught wind of the fact that hia<br />\njob was heading down the drain, but he got the impression that Debited had refused to replace hilla as comet. Then he was asked to at.<br />\ntend another meeting of the Board on the following Monday at noon.<br />\nThis meeting was attended by the entire ixely of directors except.<br />\ning Maury Nee of Washington. Isbell was in and out of the meeting.<br />\nthen finally was called in and told that he would most likely be re.<br />\ntained for the balance of the season.<br />\nLeaving the room with this assurance, Isbell walked up the<br />\nstreet and ran smack into black newspaper headlines which told of<br />\nhis ouster.<br />\nHow did this apparent switch come about? There are several<br />\nversions, a composite of which seems to be that a story on the firing<br />\nof Isbell had leaked out of the Board even before the Monday meeting took place. When at the meeting it was voted to retain him, however, it was too late to stop the release of the false story.<br />\nMonday evening the news came out that Isbell, no longer connected with the club, had found it necessary to speak to the players<br />\nand assistant coaches, many of whom were ready to quit because<br />\nof the bad deal given their well-liked anti capable coach. Isbell<br />\nconvinced them that such a move was foolish aand could only direct<br />\nfurther criticism against hint.<br />\nIt would appear at first that the Colts are better off without<br />\nIsbell.

Neither did Isbell have a line<br />\nto compare with most of the other Conference clubs.<br />\nliarvvegan, itlandin, and a few others carried the line with their<br />\nbrilliant performances. Nevertheless, despite this lack of playing<br />\nstrength, lebell's \"pass-aad-a-prayer\" club split eyen in fourteen<br />\nleague games last year and forced the Buffalo Bills into a playoff for<br />\nthe Eastern division crown.<br />\nThis. record was a brilliant tribute to Isbell's ability as a pro<br />\ncoach. With this improvement in one year, local sports followers<br />\n(including the Colts' Board of Directors) expected a championship<br />\nthis season.<br />\nThere were no grounds for such hopes. Hillenbrand had retired<br />\nfrom football ---Tittle could never be better than in '48 and it was<br />\nnatural that he should slump a bit. No outstanding line reserves had<br />\nbeen brought in to help out Dick Barwegan and \"the thin green line.\"<br />\nWhile the other A.A.C. clubs were lining up last year's college<br />\ngreats, Colt officials sat track and waited for magician Isbell to brew<br />\nthem a championship potion from second-division ingredients.<br />\nWell, Isbell couldn't do it. And it's not likely anyone else could<br />\nhey, either. When the Colts lost their first four starts, eves though<br />\nall four were played away, and at least two leases were due to fumbles<br />\n(something no coach since Adam has been able to avoid), the moanhag began long and loud.<br />\nOn the Saturday morning after the Colts' fourth loss, 35-7 to<br />\nChicago, a directors' meeting was held, to which local sports editors<br />\nPaul Menton, Jesse Linthicutu, and Roger Pippen were invited. Linthicum and Pippen attended, Menton did not; the opinions of the first<br />\ntwo were asked and a tentative plan to fire Isbell was discussed. Walter Driskill, at that time President and General Manager of the organization, was asked if he would accept the coaching job. Driskill<br />\nrecommended the retention of Isbell, put said he would take the position if necessary.<br />\nIsbell, in the meantime, had caught wind of the fact that hia<br />\njob was heading down the drain, but he got the impression that Debited had refused to replace hilla as comet. Then he was asked to at.<br />\ntend another meeting of the Board on the following Monday at noon.<br />\nThis meeting was attended by the entire ixely of directors except.<br />\ning Maury Nee of Washington. Isbell was in and out of the meeting.<br />\nthen finally was called in and told that he would most likely be re.<br />\ntained for the balance of the season.<br />\nLeaving the room with this assurance, Isbell walked up the<br />\nstreet and ran smack into black newspaper headlines which told of<br />\nhis ouster.<br />\nHow did this apparent switch come about? There are several<br />\nversions, a composite of which seems to be that a story on the firing<br />\nof Isbell had leaked out of the Board even before the Monday meeting took place. When at the meeting it was voted to retain him, however, it was too late to stop the release of the false story.<br />\nMonday evening the news came out that Isbell, no longer connected with the club, had found it necessary to speak to the players<br />\nand assistant coaches, many of whom were ready to quit because<br />\nof the bad deal given their well-liked anti capable coach. Isbell<br />\nconvinced them that such a move was foolish aand could only direct<br />\nfurther criticism against hint.<br />\nIt would appear at first that the Colts are better off without<br />\nIsbell.
