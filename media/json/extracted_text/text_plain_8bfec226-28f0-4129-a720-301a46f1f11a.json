But the officials<br />\nof the university are reluctant to admit otherwise:This<br />\nrecent controversial publication is a thorn in the hide<br />\nof the administration; and we are convinced that the<br />\nbest policy is not to deny any connection with the thorn,<br />\nor to privately \"curse it out.\"<br />\nWe have witnessed the truth of this, for example<br />\nby the fact that the flies who unmistakably prevail in<br />\nthe Hutzler Reading Room of Gilman Hall do not respond to the shooing of them away. Nor do they respond<br />\nto the swat technique; these approaches merely add to<br />\nthe persistence of their attack.<br />\nWe've noticed, further of these flies, that for the<br />\nsimple reason that the reading room is an inclosure<br />\n(comparable to the condition of the University as an<br />\nintellectual enclosure) a few of the flies suffocate. It<br />\ncomes clear, in expanding this pertinent analogy, that<br />\nthe number of the flies that do pass away are relatively<br />\nfew proportional to the number who remain in force.<br />\nAnd it follows, consequently, that the tactic of protecting<br />\nan institutional enclosure such as the University from<br />\ndiscordant elements from the inside has only a limited<br />\nand often reverse effect.<br />\nMany students know, possibly because they have<br />\nbeen discordant elements (flies in the microcosmic<br />\nsense), that the hest way to get rid of discordant elements is to remove the cause around which they rally\u2014<br />\nnot the discordants themselves.<br />\n<br />\nI<br />\n<br />\nHOMEWOOD, BALTIMORE, NOVEMBER 11, 1914<br />\n<br />\nThe eliasteamod ciceote<br />\n<br />\nAT THE HOP<br />\nBy HENRY .1. KORN<br />\nThere is an undergraduate of<br />\nour aquaintance who thinks the<br />\nHumanities Group plays rock and<br />\nroll. Such a misconception only<br />\nreminds one that the University<br />\nhas never fulfilled the promise<br />\nset forth in a record by Danny and the Juniors. While Hopkins seems to boast more of its<br />\nshare of academic intensity and<br />\nopportunity for serious scholarship one has never been fortunate enough to observe anything<br />\nresembling \"rocking and rolling,<br />\nbopping and strolling.\"<br />\n\"At the Hop,\" released in 1958<br />\nwas written and recorded under<br />\nthe supervision of Dr. Eisenhower who had recently come to<br />\nthe University from Penn State<br />\nand was casting about for ways<br />\nto improve the public image of<br />\nJohns Hopkins.

They're so great that they<br />\nmake the roof of your mouth go<br />\ndry and your feet start to tap,<br />\nand they make you forget to<br />\nbreathe. They make you wish<br />\nthat you could play the guitar<br />\nlike the world was going to close<br />\nup shop the next morning. That's<br />\nthe way they play. The Civic<br />\n<br />\nto listen to, and it sells ... and<br />\nsells, and sells. It's fine, no<br />\nknocking it, but it ain't folk<br />\nmusic, and it never will be, and<br />\nwhen you pay for folk you want<br />\nfolk, and with PP and M you<br />\nget it.<br />\nLet me tell you how it all<br />\nstarted. A few years ago, in the<br />\nearly fifties, when Sputniks was<br />\njust a Russian breakfast cereal,<br />\nsome country blues singers discovered that you could make an<br />\nelectric guitar sound like the<br />\nworld's hairiest Dobro, with<br />\nhalf the effort. Bang, R and R<br />\n<br />\nFor the University macrocosm, this analogy says<br />\nthe following things: that the four persons who have<br />\npublished the report on discrimination have done so<br />\nbecause they honestly have discerned practices within<br />\nthe University that are not compatible with their moral<br />\nconvictions. Their inspiration can hardly be quelled by<br />\nsilencing or by denying them official recognition. It<br />\nwould be hest for concerned officials to combine efforts<br />\nwith the disputants in order to discuss removal or clarification of the dispute; at any event, in order to allow<br />\nthe issue to be \"opened up\" and the elements aired out.<br />\nWe suggest, in conclusion, three steps of amelioration of this potentially explosive issue, based on policies<br />\nof inclusion rather than exclusion, of airing rather than<br />\nsuffocation.<br />\nThe administration should break the deadlock and<br />\nissue a report stating where they differ (in practice, not<br />\nnecessarily in principle); we know of many creative attempts by the administration to attack these same issues.<br />\nThe administration and the disputants might then have<br />\ngrounds for conducting a public forum in which the<br />\ntwo groups could publically show some of the principles<br />\nthey hold in common. And finally there is reason to<br />\nbelieve that a committee to take action on these common principles might evolve.<br />\n<br />\nRIMMER LUDLOW OF THE MOODY GRAPES<br />\nCenter is great .. . for basketball. For folk music it's bad.<br />\nIt's 80 bad, it makes your feet<br />\nstop tapping, it makes the roof<br />\nof your mouth get moist again,<br />\nit makes you hate guitars. While<br />\nPeter was smiling at the audience, I think he was crying inside: \"I wouldn't ask you to<br />\nplay basketball in my coffee<br />\nhouse, why do you make me sing<br />\nIn your gym?\"<br />\nThere is a new sound heard<br />\nover the land these days. They<br />\ncall it folk-rock. Call it what<br />\nyou will. It's prety good, it's. fun<br />\n<br />\nwas born. Bad, so bad, but it<br />\ntook, and it became the thing,<br />\nand the glories of rock and roll<br />\nwere sung in the cities and the<br />\nsticks (or is it styx), and every<br />\nhigh-school greaseball heard,<br />\nand saw, and said it was good.<br />\nAnd so it was good.<br />\nThen one day everybody turned on his radio and heard a<br />\nnew sound, from a new group.<br />\nIt was called \"Puff.\" Crazy name<br />\nfor a song, what? But it was<br />\nsoft, and fun, much fun. Then<br />\ncame Hootenany and folk-music<br />\nhad arriyed. It's been here since<br />\n<br />\nHenry VIII (Greensleeves on the<br />\nBolyn label), but let's say that<br />\nwith the coming of Hootenanny<br />\nIt arrived. It seemed for a time,<br />\na very short time, that it just<br />\nmight stay, that it might, in all<br />\nits goodness and all its purity,<br />\nsurvive. Wrong. Dead wrong.<br />\nYou can't sell folk. Not really,<br />\nnot with mass sales of singles,<br />\nnot in the form of sheet music<br />\nto electric guitar owners. From<br />\nthat point on it's economics.<br />\nEverything hovers around the<br />\npoint of equilibrium: folk was<br />\ncutting into rock, rock was cutting in to. folk, and anyway rock<br />\nwas bad, so bad, so very very bad.<br />\nIt looked as if rock would die,<br />\nand, folk would die, and then<br />\nwhat. Zilch.<br />\nThen one day came the Beatles, the re-birth of rock, new<br />\nrock, good rock, and then came<br />\nDylan, the poet. And the Beatles<br />\nlearned how to play a twelve<br />\nstring (it sounds like twenty<br />\nelectric plus an autoharp), and<br />\nDylan traded in his beat up Gibson (that he got at Rondo Music<br />\non U.S. 22), for a shiny 'Fender<br />\nJaguar, and folk-rock was born.<br />\nHey Mr. Tambourine Man, 1<br />\nwarms, hold your hand.<br />\nThat gets us back to Peter,<br />\nPaul and Mary, two saints and a<br />\nvirgin. They're folk singers.<br />\nThey still wonder where all<br />\nthe flowers have gone, and they<br />\nsing Dylan as Dylan can't sing<br />\nDylan.<br />\nBut Peter, Paul, and Mary, are<br />\nall people, and people have to<br />\neat, and so . they have to sing<br />\nin the temple of false gods.

The audiences that<br />\nattend rock and roll concerts have beCome older and to a degree more sophisticated; the result of The New Rock and<br />\nRoll is an increased interest in rock and<br />\nroll among college students. Like folk music<br />\nIn the early 1960's, Folk-rock or the New<br />\nRock and Roll has become the staple<br />\nmusic of college students in the midsixties.<br />\nUnlike the music of the fifties most of<br />\nthe New Rock and Roll is being composed<br />\nimaginatively, with greater freedom and<br />\nwithout the familiar cliches of the music<br />\nof the fifties. New chords, new progressions,<br />\nretrogressions and new subject matter<br />\n<br />\nof Rhythm and Blues in the Early fifties\u2014<br />\nit had its origins in the Negro and Country<br />\nmusic of the forties\u2014the bebop, etc. The<br />\nfirst true rock and roll record recorded<br />\nby a white group was probably Crazy Man<br />\nCrazy, recorded by Bill Haley and The<br />\nOomets,in 1951, but it was not until the<br />\n<br />\nrecord was rereleased in 1954 that it began<br />\nto sell. In 1953, The Comets recorded Rock<br />\nAround the Clock, and this became the first<br />\nrock and roll record to make money. But<br />\nthis record and the one that preceded it<br />\nwere only isolated cases of rock and roll<br />\nand did not really usher in the movement.<br />\nIt was a Negro group called the Chordes<br />\nthat actually began the rock and roll cycle<br />\nwith a recording of Sh-boom (later recorded for Mercury by the Crewcuts) in<br />\n1954. Record sales began increasing immediately in the rock field, but the first<br />\nreaction of the recording artists was to<br />\ncopy the works of earlier Rhythm and<br />\nBlues singers such as Ivory Joe Tucker<br />\nand Big Bill Crudup). Emulating the style<br />\nof the earlier singers, however, the rock<br />\nand roll people began to develop their own<br />\nstyle\u2014Elvis Presley, Jerry Lee Lewis, and<br />\nso on.<br />\nBy 1957 it was easy to characterize most<br />\nof the rock and roll that was being recorded. The melody used the major progression (1-4-5-1), triplets were played<br />\nagainst a basic four-four time, and the<br />\nharmony was in triads. These predictable<br />\nelements soon tired all but the adolescent<br />\nlisteners.<br />\n1958 marked the Introduction of folk<br />\nmusic into the rock and roll market with<br />\nthe Kingston Trio's Tom Dooley. They appealed primarily to college students, sold<br />\nlarge numbers of albums, had a \"good<br />\nact\", collegiate look, and a new sound. It<br />\nseemed to be the logical refuge for the<br />\nlistener tired by the familiar rock and<br />\nroll. Peter, Paul and Mary then flaunted<br />\ntheir image before the public, and it caught<br />\non\u2014among adolescent as well as the college crowds. Like the Kingston Trio, they<br />\nplayed much of the traditional folk music,<br />\nbut soon began singing the songs Of new<br />\nsong wrights\u2014particularly Bob Dylan who<br />\nshares the same manager with Peter, Paul<br />\nand Mary (Al Grossman). Don't Think<br />\nTwice It's Alright, The Times They<br />\nAre A'Clianging and other Dylan<br />\nsongs were presented to the public in a<br />\nstyle more readily accepted than Dylan's<br />\nown. Songs of a more contemplative mood<br />\nthan normal found in the old rock and<br />\nroll were heard by the public (I parted the<br />\nweeds and looked over the swamp and<br />\nseen them natives doing the Ubangi Stomp<br />\nvs Dylans\u2014When the rooster crows at the<br />\nbreak of dawn look out your window and<br />\nI'll be gone).<br />\n(Continued on Page 6)<br />\n<br />\nROLLING<br />\nSTONES<br />\n<br />\nROLLING<br />\nSTONES<br />\n<br />\nROLLING<br />\nSTONES<br />\n<br />\nStruck by the recent radical change in<br />\nthe nature and audience of American popular music, this observer of: young adult<br />\nrecreation and intellectual Interests moved<br />\nquickly to interview a few young men<br />\nwho are parties to the Rock and Roll Revolution:<br />\nBrandon de Wilde is primarily a film actor,<br />\nbut has spent the past year composing<br />\nand singing as a means to broadening his<br />\ncareer.

The element that the<br />\nBeatles introduced is essentially one of.<br />\nrestlesness: according to Gram Parsons,<br />\n\"not a set pattern of music, not done before, not the result of another cycle\u2014it is<br />\na restless music that has its own place,<br />\nthat doesn't belong to anything else\u2014not<br />\nto Presley's not to Gene Vincent, and not<br />\nto Chuck Berry, but it belongs to the<br />\nBeatles\u2014and to Dylan.\" The Beatles emulate the past only when they want to and<br />\nanytime they want to: according to Brandon their music is in \"constant flow, constant change, a new thing taken from old<br />\npatterns.<br />\nBut I digress.

CARPENTER<br />\nChairman,<br />\nThe Honor Commission<br />\nWhen a freshman first arrives<br />\nat Hopkins, he is rushed through<br />\nendless orientation functions.<br />\nOne of the half dozen assemblies<br />\nhe attends is titled \"The Honor<br />\nAssembly\", and there he is told<br />\nthat the Hopkins Honor System<br />\nis an important part of the undergraduate life, he is made<br />\naware of the mechanical aspects<br />\nof the System, and he is deliberately explained his obligations under it. Then, throughout<br />\nthe next four years, he is aware<br />\nof the System with each unproctored exam he takes and<br />\nwith each News-Letter notification of a trial, but he is never<br />\nagain reminded of his responsibilities. And although he may<br />\ngraduate convinced that he has<br />\nbeen honorable in all of his academic pursuits, he may have only<br />\npartially fulfilled his obligations<br />\nto the preservation of the System<br />\nand with it the atmosphere of<br />\ntrust and freedom from constant<br />\nobservation that is so unique to<br />\nHopkins.<br />\nYearly, precocious freshmen<br />\nscoff at the possibility of an<br />\nHonor System and occasionally<br />\nan upper classman can be heard<br />\nto mumble that he is sure some<br />\npeople cheat. Yet whether or not<br />\nthe system works is wholly up<br />\nto the student body and each<br />\nstudent's obligation is not only<br />\n<br />\nto be honorable in his academic,<br />\npursuits, but also to turn in any<br />\nviolations he may observe and<br />\nthus to protect the community<br />\nas a whole.<br />\n4 student may ask what the<br />\nphrase Honor System means,<br />\nwondering what a system of<br />\nhonor can be. And the phrase<br />\ncan have a pompous self-righteous air, but at Hopkins the<br />\nHonor System represents specific ideals defined through tradition. It embodies the accepted<br />\nmeans of pursuing academic<br />\ngoals in the process of earning<br />\na degree. Presumably the Bachelor's degree is the ultimate goal<br />\nof each student in the undergraduate body, and it is this one<br />\nfactor that necessarily unites the<br />\nstudent body into a community<br />\nwith a common purpose.<br />\nIn idealistic terms, some students may be driven on by an<br />\nunquenchable thirst for knowledge, while many more are striving to be accredited in a profession and still others look for<br />\nthe generally higher incomes of<br />\nUncollege graduates.<br />\nfortunately the basis of the<br />\nstructure of the degree is the<br />\ngrade and again all students are<br />\nevaluated in terms of it.<br />\nThe Honor System is concerned with the means a student uses<br />\nto earn his degree and thus to<br />\nearn his grades.

After each<br />\nelection this question is asked<br />\nby those who seek to divine the<br />\npolitical future by analysing the.<br />\npolitical past. The 1965 election<br />\nwas no exception to this tendency. In fact, for an \"off-year\"<br />\nelection the results were watched<br />\nwith great care by all political<br />\nattention<br />\npundits. Particular<br />\nwas focused on New York City<br />\nwhere the, young, liberal, and<br />\ndynamic John Lindsay was out<br />\nto win city hall for a RepublicanLiberal coalition and oust the<br />\nDemocrats who had been in<br />\npower since 1945. A new twist<br />\nwas present in this election, however, for a group of far-right<br />\nRepublicans under the label of<br />\nthe Conservative Party sought<br />\nto punish Lindsay and his supporters for departing from what<br />\nthe Conservatives considered to<br />\nbe genuine Republican principles.<br />\nIn other parts of the country<br />\nsomewhat similar things were<br />\nhappening. In Philadelphia a<br />\nformer Democrat was running<br />\nfor District Attorney as a Republican with ADA backing. He<br />\nwas seeking to be the first citywide official not elected by the<br />\nDemocrats since 1948. In Louisville a liberal Republican who<br />\nhad supported public accommodations legislation was seeking<br />\napproval of his actions in his<br />\nrace for mayor. All three of<br />\nthese areas had been completely<br />\nturned off by Barry Goldwater's<br />\ncandidacy and had returned<br />\nheavy Democratic<br />\nmajorities<br />\njust a year before. But in 1965,<br />\nin all three areas and in several<br />\nother similar cases the Republican candidates were successful.<br />\nFormula for Success<br />\nNow the political analyst may<br />\nRx Rx Rx Rx Rx Rx Rx Rx<br />\n<br />\nwish everybody a<br />\n<br />\n007 MEN'S<br />\nHappy Thanksgiving<br />\nDISCOUNT to HOPKINS STUDENTS & FACULTY<br />\n<br />\n....z........,,,...........<br />\n<br />\nPRODUCTS<br />\n<br />\nask whether this has any meaning for the political future. It<br />\ncertainly takes no brilliance to<br />\nsee what the voters were trying to say. After all, they have<br />\nsaying the same thing for at<br />\nleast thirty years\u2014if the Republicans want to win in the<br />\nlarge metropolitan areas with<br />\nheavily Democratic voter registrations, they must offer candidates that have attractive enough<br />\nprograms and enough appeal to<br />\ncause the voters to break out<br />\nof their traditionally Democratic<br />\nvoting patterns. In 1965 the Republicans were successful in the<br />\nthree areas mentioned because<br />\nthey did this. The result of the<br />\nelection is certainly no sign of<br />\nthe rebirth of the power of the<br />\nRepublican Party. There is<br />\nnothing to indicate that this is<br />\nso or that any such transformation will take place. The voters<br />\ndid demonstrate, however, that<br />\nthey will support the Republican<br />\nParty if it will offer a reasonable<br />\nmeans of avoiding the corruption<br />\nand inefficiency that have crept<br />\nInto so many Democratic city<br />\nadministrations.<br />\nThe Republican Party has<br />\nnever taken full advantage of<br />\nthis potential in the past and<br />\nthere is no assurance that it will<br />\nnow. It persists in offering tired<br />\ncandidates with tired ideas to<br />\nthe voters. There is, however, a<br />\nnew aspect to the political scene<br />\nthat may prompt the Party into<br />\na clarification and liberalization<br />\nof its actions. The change is the<br />\nformation of the Conservative<br />\nParties such as appeared in New<br />\nYork and Virginia.

Aside from the trust<br />\n'placed in him when an instructor leaves a room during an examination, a student is often allowed to take an examination to<br />\nhis room, or to take it at a<br />\nmore convenient time, and this<br />\ntrust spreads into innumerable<br />\nareas. Also, when a student is<br />\nsuspected of violating the system, he is tried by uninvolved<br />\npeers, rather than being immediately condemned by an engaged<br />\nInstructor, and if he is found<br />\nguilty he is given a constitutionally defined penalty.<br />\nThe Honor Commission is the<br />\nmechanical aspect of the System<br />\nand functions only through the<br />\nsupport of the community. It<br />\ndoes not police or search for violation.s, and the trial procedure<br />\nonly comes about when a suspected violation is reported to<br />\nthe Commission. The Honor<br />\nCommission uses the concept of<br />\nunfair advantage as the general<br />\ndefinition of an honor violation,<br />\n<br />\nwhile in addition, an instructor<br />\nmay define other specific actions<br />\nwhich he considers violations in<br />\nhis course. The Honor Commission is not a board devised to<br />\njudge the moral fibre of an individual, nor is an individual<br />\njudged as having offended any<br />\nGod-given morals. A violator of<br />\nthe Honor System, found guilty<br />\nby the Commission, is found<br />\nguilty of injuring the community. He has used unacceptable<br />\nmeans in his academic pursuits.<br />\nThese means are not defined as<br />\nacceptable or unacceptable according to any omnipotent moral<br />\ncode, but rather according to<br />\nmeans which are defined through<br />\ntradition within the university,<br />\ndegree-seeking community as<br />\nhonorable. \"A student's use of<br />\nunacknowledged material other<br />\nthan his own\" is one large aspect<br />\nof what is considered under the<br />\nphrase unfair advantage, and<br />\nthis coupled with \"the use of<br />\ndeceit\" nearly completes the definition.

But the officials<br />\nof the university are reluctant to admit otherwise:This<br />\nrecent controversial publication is a thorn in the hide<br />\nof the administration; and we are convinced that the<br />\nbest policy is not to deny any connection with the thorn,<br />\nor to privately \"curse it out.\"<br />\nWe have witnessed the truth of this, for example<br />\nby the fact that the flies who unmistakably prevail in<br />\nthe Hutzler Reading Room of Gilman Hall do not respond to the shooing of them away. Nor do they respond<br />\nto the swat technique; these approaches merely add to<br />\nthe persistence of their attack.<br />\nWe've noticed, further of these flies, that for the<br />\nsimple reason that the reading room is an inclosure<br />\n(comparable to the condition of the University as an<br />\nintellectual enclosure) a few of the flies suffocate. It<br />\ncomes clear, in expanding this pertinent analogy, that<br />\nthe number of the flies that do pass away are relatively<br />\nfew proportional to the number who remain in force.<br />\nAnd it follows, consequently, that the tactic of protecting<br />\nan institutional enclosure such as the University from<br />\ndiscordant elements from the inside has only a limited<br />\nand often reverse effect.<br />\nMany students know, possibly because they have<br />\nbeen discordant elements (flies in the microcosmic<br />\nsense), that the hest way to get rid of discordant elements is to remove the cause around which they rally\u2014<br />\nnot the discordants themselves.<br /><br />\nI<br /><br />\nHOMEWOOD, BALTIMORE, NOVEMBER 11, 1914<br /><br />\nThe eliasteamod ciceote<br /><br />\nAT THE HOP<br />\nBy HENRY .1.

Their inspiration can hardly be quelled by<br />\nsilencing or by denying them official recognition. It<br />\nwould be hest for concerned officials to combine efforts<br />\nwith the disputants in order to discuss removal or clarification of the dispute; at any event, in order to allow<br />\nthe issue to be \"opened up\" and the elements aired out.<br />\nWe suggest, in conclusion, three steps of amelioration of this potentially explosive issue, based on policies<br />\nof inclusion rather than exclusion, of airing rather than<br />\nsuffocation.<br />\nThe administration should break the deadlock and<br />\nissue a report stating where they differ (in practice, not<br />\nnecessarily in principle); we know of many creative attempts by the administration to attack these same issues.<br />\nThe administration and the disputants might then have<br />\ngrounds for conducting a public forum in which the<br />\ntwo groups could publically show some of the principles<br />\nthey hold in common. And finally there is reason to<br />\nbelieve that a committee to take action on these common principles might evolve.<br /><br />\nRIMMER LUDLOW OF THE MOODY GRAPES<br />\nCenter is great .. . for basketball.

The audiences that<br />\nattend rock and roll concerts have beCome older and to a degree more sophisticated; the result of The New Rock and<br />\nRoll is an increased interest in rock and<br />\nroll among college students. Like folk music<br />\nIn the early 1960's, Folk-rock or the New<br />\nRock and Roll has become the staple<br />\nmusic of college students in the midsixties.<br />\nUnlike the music of the fifties most of<br />\nthe New Rock and Roll is being composed<br />\nimaginatively, with greater freedom and<br />\nwithout the familiar cliches of the music<br />\nof the fifties. New chords, new progressions,<br />\nretrogressions and new subject matter<br /><br />\nof Rhythm and Blues in the Early fifties\u2014<br />\nit had its origins in the Negro and Country<br />\nmusic of the forties\u2014the bebop, etc. The<br />\nfirst true rock and roll record recorded<br />\nby a white group was probably Crazy Man<br />\nCrazy, recorded by Bill Haley and The<br />\nOomets,in 1951, but it was not until the<br /><br />\nrecord was rereleased in 1954 that it began<br />\nto sell. In 1953, The Comets recorded Rock<br />\nAround the Clock, and this became the first<br />\nrock and roll record to make money. But<br />\nthis record and the one that preceded it<br />\nwere only isolated cases of rock and roll<br />\nand did not really usher in the movement.<br />\nIt was a Negro group called the Chordes<br />\nthat actually began the rock and roll cycle<br />\nwith a recording of Sh-boom (later recorded for Mercury by the Crewcuts) in<br />\n1954. Record sales began increasing immediately in the rock field, but the first<br />\nreaction of the recording artists was to<br />\ncopy the works of earlier Rhythm and<br />\nBlues singers such as Ivory Joe Tucker<br />\nand Big Bill Crudup). Emulating the style<br />\nof the earlier singers, however, the rock<br />\nand roll people began to develop their own<br />\nstyle\u2014Elvis Presley, Jerry Lee Lewis, and<br />\nso on.<br />\nBy 1957 it was easy to characterize most<br />\nof the rock and roll that was being recorded. The melody used the major progression (1-4-5-1), triplets were played<br />\nagainst a basic four-four time, and the<br />\nharmony was in triads. These predictable<br />\nelements soon tired all but the adolescent<br />\nlisteners.<br />\n1958 marked the Introduction of folk<br />\nmusic into the rock and roll market with<br />\nthe Kingston Trio's Tom Dooley. They appealed primarily to college students, sold<br />\nlarge numbers of albums, had a \"good<br />\nact\", collegiate look, and a new sound. It<br />\nseemed to be the logical refuge for the<br />\nlistener tired by the familiar rock and<br />\nroll. Peter, Paul and Mary then flaunted<br />\ntheir image before the public, and it caught<br />\non\u2014among adolescent as well as the college crowds. Like the Kingston Trio, they<br />\nplayed much of the traditional folk music,<br />\nbut soon began singing the songs Of new<br />\nsong wrights\u2014particularly Bob Dylan who<br />\nshares the same manager with Peter, Paul<br />\nand Mary (Al Grossman). Don't Think<br />\nTwice It's Alright, The Times They<br />\nAre A'Clianging and other Dylan<br />\nsongs were presented to the public in a<br />\nstyle more readily accepted than Dylan's<br />\nown. Songs of a more contemplative mood<br />\nthan normal found in the old rock and<br />\nroll were heard by the public (I parted the<br />\nweeds and looked over the swamp and<br />\nseen them natives doing the Ubangi Stomp<br />\nvs Dylans\u2014When the rooster crows at the<br />\nbreak of dawn look out your window and<br />\nI'll be gone).<br />\n(Continued on Page 6)<br /><br />\nROLLING<br />\nSTONES<br /><br />\nROLLING<br />\nSTONES<br /><br />\nROLLING<br />\nSTONES<br /><br />\nStruck by the recent radical change in<br />\nthe nature and audience of American popular music, this observer of: young adult<br />\nrecreation and intellectual Interests moved<br />\nquickly to interview a few young men<br />\nwho are parties to the Rock and Roll Revolution:<br />\nBrandon de Wilde is primarily a film actor,<br />\nbut has spent the past year composing<br />\nand singing as a means to broadening his<br />\ncareer.

The element that the<br />\nBeatles introduced is essentially one of.<br />\nrestlesness: according to Gram Parsons,<br />\n\"not a set pattern of music, not done before, not the result of another cycle\u2014it is<br />\na restless music that has its own place,<br />\nthat doesn't belong to anything else\u2014not<br />\nto Presley's not to Gene Vincent, and not<br />\nto Chuck Berry, but it belongs to the<br />\nBeatles\u2014and to Dylan.\" The Beatles emulate the past only when they want to and<br />\nanytime they want to: according to Brandon their music is in \"constant flow, constant change, a new thing taken from old<br />\npatterns.<br />\nBut I digress.

After each<br />\nelection this question is asked<br />\nby those who seek to divine the<br />\npolitical future by analysing the.<br />\npolitical past. The 1965 election<br />\nwas no exception to this tendency. In fact, for an \"off-year\"<br />\nelection the results were watched<br />\nwith great care by all political<br />\nattention<br />\npundits. Particular<br />\nwas focused on New York City<br />\nwhere the, young, liberal, and<br />\ndynamic John Lindsay was out<br />\nto win city hall for a RepublicanLiberal coalition and oust the<br />\nDemocrats who had been in<br />\npower since 1945. A new twist<br />\nwas present in this election, however, for a group of far-right<br />\nRepublicans under the label of<br />\nthe Conservative Party sought<br />\nto punish Lindsay and his supporters for departing from what<br />\nthe Conservatives considered to<br />\nbe genuine Republican principles.<br />\nIn other parts of the country<br />\nsomewhat similar things were<br />\nhappening. In Philadelphia a<br />\nformer Democrat was running<br />\nfor District Attorney as a Republican with ADA backing. He<br />\nwas seeking to be the first citywide official not elected by the<br />\nDemocrats since 1948. In Louisville a liberal Republican who<br />\nhad supported public accommodations legislation was seeking<br />\napproval of his actions in his<br />\nrace for mayor. All three of<br />\nthese areas had been completely<br />\nturned off by Barry Goldwater's<br />\ncandidacy and had returned<br />\nheavy Democratic<br />\nmajorities<br />\njust a year before. But in 1965,<br />\nin all three areas and in several<br />\nother similar cases the Republican candidates were successful.<br />\nFormula for Success<br />\nNow the political analyst may<br />\nRx Rx Rx Rx Rx Rx Rx Rx<br /><br />\nwish everybody a<br /><br />\n007 MEN'S<br />\nHappy Thanksgiving<br />\nDISCOUNT to HOPKINS STUDENTS &amp; FACULTY<br /><br />\n....z........,,,...........<br /><br />\nPRODUCTS<br /><br />\nask whether this has any meaning for the political future. It<br />\ncertainly takes no brilliance to<br />\nsee what the voters were trying to say. After all, they have<br />\nsaying the same thing for at<br />\nleast thirty years\u2014if the Republicans want to win in the<br />\nlarge metropolitan areas with<br />\nheavily Democratic voter registrations, they must offer candidates that have attractive enough<br />\nprograms and enough appeal to<br />\ncause the voters to break out<br />\nof their traditionally Democratic<br />\nvoting patterns. In 1965 the Republicans were successful in the<br />\nthree areas mentioned because<br />\nthey did this. The result of the<br />\nelection is certainly no sign of<br />\nthe rebirth of the power of the<br />\nRepublican Party. There is<br />\nnothing to indicate that this is<br />\nso or that any such transformation will take place. The voters<br />\ndid demonstrate, however, that<br />\nthey will support the Republican<br />\nParty if it will offer a reasonable<br />\nmeans of avoiding the corruption<br />\nand inefficiency that have crept<br />\nInto so many Democratic city<br />\nadministrations.<br />\nThe Republican Party has<br />\nnever taken full advantage of<br />\nthis potential in the past and<br />\nthere is no assurance that it will<br />\nnow. It persists in offering tired<br />\ncandidates with tired ideas to<br />\nthe voters. There is, however, a<br />\nnew aspect to the political scene<br />\nthat may prompt the Party into<br />\na clarification and liberalization<br />\nof its actions. The change is the<br />\nformation of the Conservative<br />\nParties such as appeared in New<br />\nYork and Virginia. This new<br />\nchallenge may well force the<br />\nregular Republicans to clarify<br />\ntheir stand on the issues. In<br />\nthis way the Conservative Parties<br />\nmay be a healthy impetus to a<br />\nParty that must seek to divorce<br />\nItself in the voters' minds from<br />\nthe extremist elements that<br />\nhave made the whole organization appear to be reactionary<br />\nand static.<br /><br />\nIf one looks at the Conservative vote in New York City in<br />\nthe last election, he can see that<br />\nGREEN WAY<br />\n0 the Conservative Party drew<br />\nsupport from both Democrats<br />\nPHARMACY<br />\nand Republicans in nearly equal<br />\nCharles and 34th Sts.<br />\namounts.

There<br />\nis no indication from past experience that the Party will make<br />\nany such effort, however, and if<br />\nthe Republicans fail to act the<br />\nrecent election will have no more<br />\nsignificance than the simple fact<br />\nthat it occurred.<br /><br />\n'69 Pres.<br />\nPlans Year<br /><br />\nConservative Role<br /><br />\nAre Available At<br /><br />\nLindsay to clearly divorce himself , from the image of Goldwater Republicanism.

Also, when a student is<br />\nsuspected of violating the system, he is tried by uninvolved<br />\npeers, rather than being immediately condemned by an engaged<br />\nInstructor, and if he is found<br />\nguilty he is given a constitutionally defined penalty.<br />\nThe Honor Commission is the<br />\nmechanical aspect of the System<br />\nand functions only through the<br />\nsupport of the community.

The Honor Commission is not a board devised to<br />\njudge the moral fibre of an individual, nor is an individual<br />\njudged as having offended any<br />\nGod-given morals.
