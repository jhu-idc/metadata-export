The climate has, therefore,<br />\na wide range, from the soft maritime air of the At-<br />\nlantic coast, along the eastern shore, to the compara-<br />\ntively cold and severe atmosphere of the mountain<br />\ncounties. The south-eastern extremity of the State<br />\nhas the broad Chesapeake Bay to moderate its ex-<br />\ntremes,-as well as the Atlantic coast and the not<br />\nremote Gulf Stream. It is, therefore, much like<br />\nNorfolk and the Carolina coasts, and but little be-<br />\nyond the range of the live-oak and the cotton- and<br />\nrice-fields. Yet none of these are quite successful<br />\nwithin its limits. The summer heats of the interior<br />\nare greatly tempered here, and in many respects the<br />\nclimate is delightful. Inland, and on leaving the<br />\nshores of the Chesapeake Bay, the extremes of heat<br />\nand cold alike are greater, and such as generally<br />\nbelong to the latitude. Altogether, Maryland has a<br />\nclimate sensibly warmer and softer than the average<br />\nof the States of the Atlantic coast.<br />\n<br />\nIn the central part of the State the range of single<br />\nextremes is great, and may be stated at 10\u00b0 below<br />\nzero for the lowest, and 100\u00b0 above for the greatest<br />\nheats of summer. In the country about Baltimore<br />\nand Washington such is the range : extremes ot 100\u00b0<br />\nin summer have been several times recorded, one<br />\nsuch instance occurring in June, 1853 ; while records<br />\nof 95\u00b0 to 98\u00b0 are quite frequent, and may be ex-<br />\npected every summer. These extremes are not<br />\ngreater, however, than is every year experienced as<br />\nfar north as New England, though a greater number<br />\nof hot days will be observed in Maryland. During<br />\nthese heats the atmosphere is usually more dry and<br />\nclastic than further north. As to cold extremes,<br />\nobservations as low as 10\u00b0 below zero have been re-<br />\ncorded at Washington, and sometimes a period of<br />\ncontinuous cold occurs, covering the ground with<br />\nsnow for two or three months. 1In 1856-7 such se-<br />\nverity prevailed from January to March, the use of<br />\nsleighs being constant at Washington and Baltimore.<br />\nIce formed to the depth of twelve or fifteen inches<br />\non the Potomac River, and on the shallow arms of<br />\nChesapeake Bay. DBut such severity is rare, and<br />\n<br />\n\u201cmay be expected only at intervals of about twenty-<br />\nfive years. Generally, the winters are open and<br />\nmild, without much snow, and with very little ice.<br />\nA larger share of fair weather prevails at this season<br />\nthan in any States northward.<br />\n<br />\nThe average temperature for the year at Balti-<br />\nmore is 54\u00b0, being three degrees warmer than New<br />\nYork city, and one and a half degrees warmer than<br />\nPhiladelphia. The isothermal lines recede much on<br />\nthe mountains, however, while they advance to but<br />\n<br />\nlittle higher figures in the maritime districts. The<br />\nsummer mean at Baltimore is 75\u00b0, being two and a<br />\nhalf degrees warmer than New York, and one degree<br />\nwarmer than Philadelphia. The winter average is<br />\n34\u00b0 at Baltimore, being two and a half degrees<br />\nwarmer than New York, and nearly one and a half<br />\ndegrees warmer than Philadelphia. In the extreme<br />\nsoutheast the winter average rises five degrees higher,<br />\nbeing nearly as warm as Norfolk, which is 40\u00b0 for<br />\nthe winter. At Crisfield, Snow Hill, and Salisbury,<br />\nthis mild winter climate is conspicuous, as also in<br />\nSt. Mary\u2019s County, west of the Bay. At Frederick,<br />\nin the western central part of the State, the climate<br />\nis that of Philadelphia, very nearly. Further west,<br />\nand among the mountain valleys, the averages are<br />\nnearly those of Pittsburgh, though colder in the<br />\nhigher districts. No records exist for these more<br />\n<br />\n-<br />\n<br />\n <br />\n<br />\nelevated localities : they are identical in -climate, as<br />\nin configuration, with the mountains of Pennsylvania<br />\nand Virginia.<br />\n<br />\nThe quantity of rain falling on the eastern shore,<br />\nwithin the cooling influence of the Atlantic, is only<br />\nabout 42 inches; but inland, and along the borders<br />\nof Chesapeake Bay, the quantity rises to 46 inches<br />\nnearly. Rains are here conspicuous for the quantity<br />\nfalling in single storms, though no greater number<br />\nof storms or proportion of cloudy weather exists,<br />\nthan in other districts where a less aggregate depth<br />\nfalls. In the range from Baltimore to Washington<br />\n<br />\nthe quantity falhng is about 44 inches. Then it falls<br />\n<br />\noff to 42 inches, and again to 40 on the eastern slope<br />\nof the mountains, with but 38 in the higher localities.<br />\nNearer the Ohio River the quantity increases again,<br />\nbut this is beyond the boundary of Maryland.<br />\n<br />\nGreat as is the quantity of rain falling, the atmos-<br />\nphere is free from excessive humidity or great sen-<br />\nsible saturation. The proportion of fair and fine<br />\nweather is large at all seasons, probably one-third<br />\nto one-half greater than in the latitude of New York.<br />\nThe increase in aggregate depth of rain is due to the<br />\ngreat quantities falling in single storms. These<br />\nheavy rains cause frequent floods in the streams and<br />\nrivers of the State, particularly in spring and early<br />\nsummer. The range in the quantity of water falling<br />\nin a single month may be from a mere fraction of<br />\nan inch to sixteen inches; and in extreme years the<br />\nquantity for one year may amount to twice as much<br />\nas falls in a dry year.<br />\n<br />\nAs has been said, however, the atmosphere is not<br />\nsaturated or unhealthy from this large rain-fall. The<br />\ngeneral climate is bracing and healthy; the low and<br />\nmarshy borders of the Bay and of the streams of<br />\nthe east afford local malaria, but not of a severe or<br />\ndangerous character. Nor is the State liable to<br />\ndangerous fevers, or other diseases of tropical cli-<br />\nmates.<br />\n<br />\nThe following tabular statements illustrate the<br />\naverages of temperature and of the quantity of rain<br />\nfalling in Maryland, within a reasonably near ap-<br />\nproximation, yet they are not as full as they should<br />\nbe, and need to be supplemented by observations<br />\ntaken within the limits of other States. The aver-<br />\nages of temperature are relatively more full, and the<br />\ndeterminations more exact than those of the quantity<br />\nof rain. The range in extreme years is not so great<br />\nas to obscure the result, even if a very limited period<br />\nis embraced; while with observations of the quan-<br />\ntity of rain, the range in extreme years is such as to<br />\nrender positive determinations difficult with less<br />\nthan twenty years of continuous observation. There<br />\nis also frequent deficiency in the quantity recorded,<br />\nthe excess in heavy rains not being all included, and<br />\nsnow not being melted, or estimated for. The po-<br />\nsition of the instruments must also be carefully<br />\nadjusted, to make the record full. The records at<br />\nthe military post at Baltimore, and all the stations<br />\nat Washington, are probably deficient in quantity.<br />\n<br />\nThe great range in temperature between extreme<br />\nmonths or seasons may be illustrated by citations<br />\nfrom the record at Fort McHenry, Baltimore, where<br />\nwe have twenty-nine years of continuous observa-<br />\ntion, 1831 to 1859.<br />\n<br />\n    <br />\n <br />\n<br />\nA Coldest. \u2018Warmest.

Generally, the winters are open and<br />\nmild, without much snow, and with very little ice.<br />\nA larger share of fair weather prevails at this season<br />\nthan in any States northward.<br /><br />\nThe average temperature for the year at Balti-<br />\nmore is 54\u00b0, being three degrees warmer than New<br />\nYork city, and one and a half degrees warmer than<br />\nPhiladelphia. The isothermal lines recede much on<br />\nthe mountains, however, while they advance to but<br /><br />\nlittle higher figures in the maritime districts. The<br />\nsummer mean at Baltimore is 75\u00b0, being two and a<br />\nhalf degrees warmer than New York, and one degree<br />\nwarmer than Philadelphia. The winter average is<br />\n34\u00b0 at Baltimore, being two and a half degrees<br />\nwarmer than New York, and nearly one and a half<br />\ndegrees warmer than Philadelphia. In the extreme<br />\nsoutheast the winter average rises five degrees higher,<br />\nbeing nearly as warm as Norfolk, which is 40\u00b0 for<br />\nthe winter. At Crisfield, Snow Hill, and Salisbury,<br />\nthis mild winter climate is conspicuous, as also in<br />\nSt. Mary\u2019s County, west of the Bay. At Frederick,<br />\nin the western central part of the State, the climate<br />\nis that of Philadelphia, very nearly. Further west,<br />\nand among the mountain valleys, the averages are<br />\nnearly those of Pittsburgh, though colder in the<br />\nhigher districts. No records exist for these more<br /><br />\n-<br /><br /><br /><br />\nelevated localities : they are identical in -climate, as<br />\nin configuration, with the mountains of Pennsylvania<br />\nand Virginia.<br /><br />\nThe quantity of rain falling on the eastern shore,<br />\nwithin the cooling influence of the Atlantic, is only<br />\nabout 42 inches; but inland, and along the borders<br />\nof Chesapeake Bay, the quantity rises to 46 inches<br />\nnearly. Rains are here conspicuous for the quantity<br />\nfalling in single storms, though no greater number<br />\nof storms or proportion of cloudy weather exists,<br />\nthan in other districts where a less aggregate depth<br />\nfalls. In the range from Baltimore to Washington<br /><br />\nthe quantity falhng is about 44 inches. Then it falls<br /><br />\noff to 42 inches, and again to 40 on the eastern slope<br />\nof the mountains, with but 38 in the higher localities.<br />\nNearer the Ohio River the quantity increases again,<br />\nbut this is beyond the boundary of Maryland.<br /><br />\nGreat as is the quantity of rain falling, the atmos-<br />\nphere is free from excessive humidity or great sen-<br />\nsible saturation. The proportion of fair and fine<br />\nweather is large at all seasons, probably one-third<br />\nto one-half greater than in the latitude of New York.<br />\nThe increase in aggregate depth of rain is due to the<br />\ngreat quantities falling in single storms. These<br />\nheavy rains cause frequent floods in the streams and<br />\nrivers of the State, particularly in spring and early<br />\nsummer. The range in the quantity of water falling<br />\nin a single month may be from a mere fraction of<br />\nan inch to sixteen inches; and in extreme years the<br />\nquantity for one year may amount to twice as much<br />\nas falls in a dry year.<br /><br />\nAs has been said, however, the atmosphere is not<br />\nsaturated or unhealthy from this large rain-fall. The<br />\ngeneral climate is bracing and healthy; the low and<br />\nmarshy borders of the Bay and of the streams of<br />\nthe east afford local malaria, but not of a severe or<br />\ndangerous character. Nor is the State liable to<br />\ndangerous fevers, or other diseases of tropical cli-<br />\nmates.<br /><br />\nThe following tabular statements illustrate the<br />\naverages of temperature and of the quantity of rain<br />\nfalling in Maryland, within a reasonably near ap-<br />\nproximation, yet they are not as full as they should<br />\nbe, and need to be supplemented by observations<br />\ntaken within the limits of other States. The aver-<br />\nages of temperature are relatively more full, and the<br />\ndeterminations more exact than those of the quantity<br />\nof rain. The range in extreme years is not so great<br />\nas to obscure the result, even if a very limited period<br />\nis embraced; while with observations of the quan-<br />\ntity of rain, the range in extreme years is such as to<br />\nrender positive determinations difficult with less<br />\nthan twenty years of continuous observation. There<br />\nis also frequent deficiency in the quantity recorded,<br />\nthe excess in heavy rains not being all included, and<br />\nsnow not being melted, or estimated for. The po-<br />\nsition of the instruments must also be carefully<br />\nadjusted, to make the record full. The records at<br />\nthe military post at Baltimore, and all the stations<br />\nat Washington, are probably deficient in quantity.<br /><br />\nThe great range in temperature between extreme<br />\nmonths or seasons may be illustrated by citations<br />\nfrom the record at Fort McHenry, Baltimore, where<br />\nwe have twenty-nine years of continuous observa-<br />\ntion, 1831 to 1859.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />\nA Coldest. \u2018Warmest.
