And it remained unclear whether that outcry -- as manifested in countless<br />\ndiscussions, petitions, letters, editorials, and a definitive undergraduate referendum -would be heeded. The events of last week, culminating in the authorization of an ad<br />\nhoc review of Dr. Pfeffer's candidacy for tenure, have proven that the student<br />\nsentiment at the University have not gone unnoticed.<br />\nWe of the Student Council applaud President Muller's approval of the ad hoc<br />\ncommittee investigation, and fervently hope that the advent of a new responsiveness<br />\nto student opinion, at Hopkins and throughout academia, has begun.<br />\nDavid Chcsanow, President<br />\n<br />\n\fpage 2/special edition/november 15, 1977<br />\n<br />\n11ENY1 LEITEI<br />\n<br />\n14ait<br />\n<br />\neditor<br />\nj.d.considine<br />\n<br />\nThanks to you, It's working<br />\n<br />\ncontributing editor<br />\nmike deak<br />\nnews editor<br />\nrobert riggs<br />\nphoto production manager<br />\njennifer bishop<br />\nbusiness managers<br />\neiliot grover<br />\nmark grover<br />\ndistribution<br />\ndon dinegar<br />\nhalf-tones<br />\nfrank white<br />\nmusical direction<br />\ndave hawk<br />\nchoereography<br />\nstudent council<br />\nproduction<br />\nthe usual folks<br />\nad production<br />\nphilip konort<br />\n<br />\nbox 1230<br />\njohns hopkins university<br />\nbaltimore, md. 21218<br />\n301-338-7647<br />\n<br />\nour motto only appears in friday issues<br />\n<br />\nThe New Political Caucus commends the decision,'<br />\nannounced Friday, November 11th, to appoint an ad hoc<br />\ncommittee to review Dr. Pfeffer's candidacy for tenure.<br />\nWe continue to feel that an ad hoc committee is the only<br />\nway to fairly and justly examine Dr. Pfeffer's scholarship<br />\nin light of the extreme controversy surrounding this entire<br />\nissue. Because the ad hoc committee has been approved<br />\nthe rally which had been planned for Tuesday, November<br />\n15th is cancelled. We would, however, like to thank<br />\neveryone who spent so much time and effort working<br />\nwith us for fairness, including: the Student Council, the<br />\nmany faculty members and members of the<br />\nadministration who offered advice and support, the<br />\nBaltimore city newspapers and television stations, the<br />\nCity Squeeze, the News-Letter, the Office of the<br />\nChaplain, the many graduate students who wrote letters<br />\nand signed petitions, and all of the undergraduates who<br />\nparticipated in the student referendum. The interest and<br />\nconcern exhibited by the student body in the past few<br />\nweeks demonstrates that not only are Hopkins students<br />\nnot as apathetic as we are sometimes portrayed, but that<br />\nwe are capable of expressing our opinion in a mature,<br />\nintelligent, but nevertheless, forceful manner.<br />\nThough last Friday's News-letter's editorial described<br />\nthe campus as \"bitterly divided\" we would strongly assert<br />\nthat the lines of division are not clearly or easily defined.<br />\nIt is definitely not a case of students against faculty or<br />\nfaculty against administration, though some might<br />\nmistakenly try to. describe it in those terms. Instead, Dr.<br />\nPfeffer's appeal and the discussions about it have provided<br />\nall of us with the opportunity to question and decide for<br />\nourselves and our university what abstract concepts like<br />\nacademic freedom and good scholarship mean in real'<br />\n<br />\nsituations. In the past few months many people have<br />\nbecome familiar with the mechanics of getting tenure at<br />\nHopkins. Now is a very good time to question that system<br />\nand to ask whether something might be done to insure<br />\ndue process and impartial evaluations in every tenure<br />\ndecision, not just those approved by a particular<br />\ndepartment or those that attract publicity. As students<br />\nwho have suffered through more than one disorganized or<br />\nbadly communicated lecture we would do well to go one<br />\nstep further and ask whether teaching ought to be<br />\nconsidered much more seriously in these tenure decisions<br />\nin the future. It is our - position that there ought to be<br />\nsome provisions within this university to insure the<br />\nquality of undergraduate teaching. After all aren't we here<br />\nto get an education? Presumably we are paying tuition to<br />\nreceive something which we could not get staying at home<br />\nand reading the books written by various faculty<br />\nmembers.<br />\nHopefully the decision to appoint an ad hoc committee<br />\nmarks the beginning of a new consciousness at Hopkins. A<br />\nconsciousness which in part says that it is about time<br />\npeople took an interest in what is going on in this<br />\nuniversity and challenged the laws of inertia at work to<br />\nmaintain the status quo. Hopefully this action also marks<br />\nmovement towards a final decision which will end the<br />\nlong and undoubtedly painful ordeal of Dr. Pfeffer and<br />\nhis family. The New Political Caucus remains confident of<br />\nDr. Pfeffer's superb teaching ability and of his value to<br />\nthe entire university community, and we await the reports<br />\non his scholarship compiled by an unbiased ad hoc<br />\ncommittee.<br />\nThe New Political Caucus<br />\n<br />\n311311A1311d<br />\n<br />\nThe JHU Junior CIN Senior Classes Present<br />\n<br />\nat<br />\n<br />\nA Maryland Premiere<br />\n<br />\nLearn about how<br />\nthe school is run<br />\nInformal Discussion<br />\nwith<br />\n<br />\nProvost Dr. Longaker<br />\nand<br />\nDean of Undergraduate Studies<br />\n<br />\nDr. Sigmund Suskind<br />\n<br />\nFriday, November 18<br />\n<br />\nAll Showirigs on the Hopkins<br />\nHomewood Campus, Charles & 34th Sts.<br />\nWednesday, Nov. 16<br />\n8:00 & lp:00 pm<br />\nThursday, Nov. 17<br />\n8:0O& 10:00 pm<br />\nFriday, Nov. 18<br />\n8:00& 10:00 pm<br />\n12:90 Midni9ht<br />\nSaturday, Nov. 19<br />\n7:00 pm<br />\n10%.00 pm & 12:00 Midnight ,<br />\nSunday, Nov. 20<br />\n7:00.84 9:00 pm<br />\n<br />\nGeneral Admission $1.50<br />\nHopkins Jrs. & Srs. $1.00<br />\n<br />\nListening-Viewing Room<br />\nHopkins Student Union<br />\nShriver Hall<br />\nAuditorium<br />\nListening-Viewing Room<br />\nHopkins Student Union<br />\nShaffer 3<br />\nListening-Viewing Room<br />\nHopkins Student Union<br />\nShaffer 3<br />\nShaffer 3<br />\n<br />\nin the Glass Pavilion<br />\nTime 5:00-6:30<br />\n<br />\nRefreshments<br />\n<br />\n\fnovember 15, 1977/special edition/page 3<br />\n<br />\nCome and Complain about the Social<br />\nLife at Hopkins<br />\nat the Student Council<br />\nSocial Committee meeting.<br />\nin the_Student Council Office<br />\n11111\u2022111111111 ME<br />\n<br />\nMIMI<br />\n<br />\nThursday, Nov.17 at 6<br />\nFor more info contact<br />\nSteve Taitz at 338-8208 or x8203<br />\n<br />\n11111111111M111 IIIMI MIMIMEIINII MIENIMMO INN IMMO<br />\n<br />\nMEI<br />\n<br />\n11111111111111111<br />\n<br />\n*** THE RIDE SERVICE ***<br />\nWILL BE IN OPERATION FOR THANKSGIVING<br />\nCALL 338-8203 WED.

The events of last week, culminating in the authorization of an ad<br />\nhoc review of Dr. Pfeffer's candidacy for tenure, have proven that the student<br />\nsentiment at the University have not gone unnoticed.<br />\nWe of the Student Council applaud President Muller's approval of the ad hoc<br />\ncommittee investigation, and fervently hope that the advent of a new responsiveness<br />\nto student opinion, at Hopkins and throughout academia, has begun.<br />\nDavid Chcsanow, President<br /><br />\npage 2/special edition/november 15, 1977<br /><br />\n11ENY1 LEITEI<br /><br />\n14ait<br /><br />\neditor<br />\nj.d.considine<br /><br />\nThanks to you, It's working<br /><br />\ncontributing editor<br />\nmike deak<br />\nnews editor<br />\nrobert riggs<br />\nphoto production manager<br />\njennifer bishop<br />\nbusiness managers<br />\neiliot grover<br />\nmark grover<br />\ndistribution<br />\ndon dinegar<br />\nhalf-tones<br />\nfrank white<br />\nmusical direction<br />\ndave hawk<br />\nchoereography<br />\nstudent council<br />\nproduction<br />\nthe usual folks<br />\nad production<br />\nphilip konort<br /><br />\nbox 1230<br />\njohns hopkins university<br />\nbaltimore, md. 21218<br />\n301-338-7647<br /><br />\nour motto only appears in friday issues<br /><br />\nThe New Political Caucus commends the decision,'<br />\nannounced Friday, November 11th, to appoint an ad hoc<br />\ncommittee to review Dr. Pfeffer's candidacy for tenure.<br />\nWe continue to feel that an ad hoc committee is the only<br />\nway to fairly and justly examine Dr. Pfeffer's scholarship<br />\nin light of the extreme controversy surrounding this entire<br />\nissue. Because the ad hoc committee has been approved<br />\nthe rally which had been planned for Tuesday, November<br />\n15th is cancelled. We would, however, like to thank<br />\neveryone who spent so much time and effort working<br />\nwith us for fairness, including: the Student Council, the<br />\nmany faculty members and members of the<br />\nadministration who offered advice and support, the<br />\nBaltimore city newspapers and television stations, the<br />\nCity Squeeze, the News-Letter, the Office of the<br />\nChaplain, the many graduate students who wrote letters<br />\nand signed petitions, and all of the undergraduates who<br />\nparticipated in the student referendum. The interest and<br />\nconcern exhibited by the student body in the past few<br />\nweeks demonstrates that not only are Hopkins students<br />\nnot as apathetic as we are sometimes portrayed, but that<br />\nwe are capable of expressing our opinion in a mature,<br />\nintelligent, but nevertheless, forceful manner.<br />\nThough last Friday's News-letter's editorial described<br />\nthe campus as \"bitterly divided\" we would strongly assert<br />\nthat the lines of division are not clearly or easily defined.<br />\nIt is definitely not a case of students against faculty or<br />\nfaculty against administration, though some might<br />\nmistakenly try to. describe it in those terms. Instead, Dr.<br />\nPfeffer's appeal and the discussions about it have provided<br />\nall of us with the opportunity to question and decide for<br />\nourselves and our university what abstract concepts like<br />\nacademic freedom and good scholarship mean in real'<br /><br />\nsituations. In the past few months many people have<br />\nbecome familiar with the mechanics of getting tenure at<br />\nHopkins. Now is a very good time to question that system<br />\nand to ask whether something might be done to insure<br />\ndue process and impartial evaluations in every tenure<br />\ndecision, not just those approved by a particular<br />\ndepartment or those that attract publicity. As students<br />\nwho have suffered through more than one disorganized or<br />\nbadly communicated lecture we would do well to go one<br />\nstep further and ask whether teaching ought to be<br />\nconsidered much more seriously in these tenure decisions<br />\nin the future. It is our - position that there ought to be<br />\nsome provisions within this university to insure the<br />\nquality of undergraduate teaching. After all aren't we here<br />\nto get an education? Presumably we are paying tuition to<br />\nreceive something which we could not get staying at home<br />\nand reading the books written by various faculty<br />\nmembers.<br />\nHopefully the decision to appoint an ad hoc committee<br />\nmarks the beginning of a new consciousness at Hopkins. A<br />\nconsciousness which in part says that it is about time<br />\npeople took an interest in what is going on in this<br />\nuniversity and challenged the laws of inertia at work to<br />\nmaintain the status quo. Hopefully this action also marks<br />\nmovement towards a final decision which will end the<br />\nlong and undoubtedly painful ordeal of Dr. Pfeffer and<br />\nhis family. The New Political Caucus remains confident of<br />\nDr. Pfeffer's superb teaching ability and of his value to<br />\nthe entire university community, and we await the reports<br />\non his scholarship compiled by an unbiased ad hoc<br />\ncommittee.<br />\nThe New Political Caucus<br /><br />\n311311A1311d<br /><br />\nThe JHU Junior CIN Senior Classes Present<br /><br />\nat<br /><br />\nA Maryland Premiere<br /><br />\nLearn about how<br />\nthe school is run<br />\nInformal Discussion<br />\nwith<br /><br />\nProvost Dr. Longaker<br />\nand<br />\nDean of Undergraduate Studies<br /><br />\nDr. Sigmund Suskind<br /><br />\nFriday, November 18<br /><br />\nAll Showirigs on the Hopkins<br />\nHomewood Campus, Charles &amp; 34th Sts.<br />\nWednesday, Nov. 16<br />\n8:00 &amp; lp:00 pm<br />\nThursday, Nov. 17<br />\n8:0O&amp; 10:00 pm<br />\nFriday, Nov. 18<br />\n8:00&amp; 10:00 pm<br />\n12:90 Midni9ht<br />\nSaturday, Nov. 19<br />\n7:00 pm<br />\n10%.00 pm &amp; 12:00 Midnight ,<br />\nSunday, Nov. 20<br />\n7:00.84 9:00 pm<br /><br />\nGeneral Admission $1.50<br />\nHopkins Jrs. &amp; Srs. $1.00<br /><br />\nListening-Viewing Room<br />\nHopkins Student Union<br />\nShriver Hall<br />\nAuditorium<br />\nListening-Viewing Room<br />\nHopkins Student Union<br />\nShaffer 3<br />\nListening-Viewing Room<br />\nHopkins Student Union<br />\nShaffer 3<br />\nShaffer 3<br /><br />\nin the Glass Pavilion<br />\nTime 5:00-6:30<br /><br />\nRefreshments<br /><br />\nnovember 15, 1977/special edition/page 3<br /><br />\nCome and Complain about the Social<br />\nLife at Hopkins<br />\nat the Student Council<br />\nSocial Committee meeting.<br />\nin the_Student Council Office<br />\n11111\u2022111111111 ME<br /><br />\nMIMI<br /><br />\nThursday, Nov.17 at 6<br />\nFor more info contact<br />\nSteve Taitz at 338-8208 or x8203<br /><br />\n11111111111M111 IIIMI MIMIMEIINII MIENIMMO INN IMMO<br /><br />\nMEI<br /><br />\n11111111111111111<br /><br />\n*** THE RIDE SERVICE ***<br />\nWILL BE IN OPERATION FOR THANKSGIVING<br />\nCALL 338-8203 WED.
