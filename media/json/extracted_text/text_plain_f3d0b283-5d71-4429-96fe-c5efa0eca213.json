A<br />\nsmall jagged rock was apparently<br />\nthrown at the Pavilion wall by<br />\none of the teenagers.<br />\nAlthough no one saw the<br />\nvandalism take place, Weinbach<br />\nsaid that a custodial foreman<br />\nworking at the time saw the<br />\nteenagers in the vicinity of the<br />\nUnion and pursued them in his<br />\ncar when he saw the breakage.<br />\nHe was unable to apprehend<br />\nthe vandals or get a good<br />\ndescription,- though.<br />\nThe specially-tempered glass<br />\nfor the Pavilion automatically<br />\nshatters upon any sharp contact.<br />\nThough the actual hole caused by<br />\nthe rock was less than an inch<br />\nwide, the entire pane shattered.<br />\n\"Once you fracture any part<br />\nof the surface of the glass you<br />\nautomatically destroy the pane,<br />\nbecause the glass is chemically<br />\ntempered,\" said.

If<br />\none topic captures a majority of<br />\nthe votes cast, it will be<br />\n<br />\ndesignated as the selected<br />\nprogram without further<br />\nconsideration by the Committee,<br />\nLast year only seven topics<br />\nwere registered with the<br />\nSelections Committee, of which<br />\nno more than four could be put<br />\non the ballot. The selected<br />\nprogram won by a plurality of<br />\nthe votes. In contrast the system<br />\nused in 1972 involved only the<br />\nSC Selections Committee. The<br />\npresent process is actually a<br />\ncompromise between the two<br />\nprevious ones.<br />\nAndy Fredman, chairman of<br />\nthe Selections Committee, said,<br />\n\"In one way the new procedure<br />\nappears to involve less student<br />\ninput.

Now,<br />\nhowever, the students see more<br />\ntopics.\"<br />\nThe proposed topics presented<br />\n<br />\nto the students will he those that<br />\nthe committee believes most<br />\nfeasible. Since specific<br />\ninformation such as the names of<br />\nthe sponsors, provisions for<br />\nfinance, and the speakers list will<br />\nnot be available to the students<br />\nthe Committee believes it is<br />\njustified in keeping the<br />\nresponsibility for the final<br />\ndecision.<br />\nFredman pointed out, \"It is<br />\ninappropriate to release a speaker<br />\nlist before the people involved<br />\nare contacted and recruited. The<br />\nnames of the students who<br />\nsubmitted programs are being<br />\nwithheld to prevent a political<br />\nselection.\"<br />\nHe concluded, \"When the<br />\nthree topics come back to the<br />\nCommittee we will have at our<br />\ndisposal all the information that<br />\nis pertinenet.

Homewood<br />\ncommunity regarding the student<br />\nhousing problem at a meeting last<br />\nnight sponsored by the GHCC<br />\nand Hopkins.<br />\nHowever, the spirit of<br />\ncooperation was not apparent as<br />\nseveral residents not only<br />\nopposed a possible University<br />\npurchase of housing, but also<br />\nprotested the prospect of student<br />\nresidents at all.<br />\nDick Cook, executive director<br />\nof the GHCC,firmly stated that a<br />\nmajor sale of housing units would<br />\n\"be of great concern to the<br />\nresidents because it would bring<br />\nmassive changes in the present<br />\nneighborhood.\"<br />\nOne resident of Charles Village<br />\nsaki Werll fighrthel Uttiversity if 2'<br />\nthey try to buy housing.<br />\nStudents just don't regard this<br />\narea as a community.\" Other<br />\nresidents cited unfavorable cases<br />\nwhere students have neglected<br />\nthe upkeep. of their residences<br />\nand made excessive noise.<br />\nHowever, Dean of Students'<br />\nJakie Hall replied \"that the<br />\nstudents have made housing a<br />\nhigh priority.\"<br />\nHall cited the election of Mike<br />\nLenardo, Chain- an of the SC<br />\nHousing Comm, tee, the Senior<br />\nClass housing fund, and a host of<br />\ncomplaints about housing he has<br />\nheard this past \u2022eek in support<br />\nof his contention.<br />\nThe Dean revealed that he's<br />\nupset- about the inability of<br />\nfemales, Blacks, and other<br />\nminority, students to secure<br />\nhousing in the area. Furthermore,<br />\nHall expressed disgust at<br />\nlandlords who \"have ripped off<br />\nHopkins students.\"<br />\nLenard\u00b0 and Dean Hall stated<br />\nthat the situation is critical in the<br />\nface of the rising Hopkins'<br />\nstudent population and the<br />\nlimited number of<br />\nUniversity-owned units. In a<br />\nletter sent to Homewood-area<br />\nresidents, Hall claimed that there<br />\nis an \"immediate need\" for \"250<br />\nadditional housing units.\"<br />\n\"I've had upset students in my<br />\noffice,\" stated Hall, \"who, even<br />\nbefore the lottery, have been<br />\nunable to find housing after<br />\nlooking for months.\"<br />\nBaltimore City's Housing and<br />\nCommunity Development<br />\nAgency was also present at the<br />\nmeeting and although they did<br />\nnot have specific solutions, did<br />\npromise to \"follow up on student<br />\nhousing complaints.\"<br />\n<br />\noperational 'deficits.<br />\nDr. Carl Christ, Political<br />\nEconomy, observes that in the<br />\npast year the value of Hopkins'<br />\nendowment has plummeted alone<br />\nwith the stock market.<br />\nChrist added, though, that th(<br />\nincome from the endowment ha:<br />\nnot decreased. Of late, th(<br />\nUniversity has not been buyinf<br />\nstocks with new gifts, but ha.<br />\ninstead purchased short-tern<br />\nnotes yielding high interests. Thi:<br />\nis one reason the budget has been<br />\nbalanced for the last several<br />\nyears, according to Christ.<br />\nAs chairman of President<br />\nMuller's Ad Hoc Budgetary<br />\nCommittee,'Christ is very much<br />\naware of the problems currently<br />\nfacing private instutions in the<br />\npresent economic turmoil.<br />\n\"Private colleges won't do a<br />\ngood job in the present pinch if<br />\nwe don't know what we want to<br />\ndo,\" Christ continued, \"we can't<br />\nafford to do everything. There<br />\nare choices which have to be<br />\nmade in light of our mission.\"<br />\nIn this light, Christ's ad hoc<br />\ncommittee pressed for an<br />\nin-depth analysis of the growth<br />\nof supportive services versus the<br />\n<br />\nCharles Noon of HCD<br />\nsuggested that the \"University go<br />\ninto the housing market and lease<br />\nresidence's to students.\"<br />\nHowever, Noon continued that<br />\nthis situation is \"not the city's<br />\nproblem,\" and asserted that \"the<br />\nHCD cannot intervene between<br />\nthe community adn the school.\"<br />\nAdditionally, Roger Windsor<br />\nof the city's Home Ownership<br />\nOffice regarded the possibility of<br />\nstudent-purchased homes in<br />\neither cooperatives or through a<br />\ncondominium arrangement as<br />\n\"impractical.\" \"Not only is the<br />\nstudent population transient,\" he<br />\nexplained, \"but the cost of a<br />\nmortgage and renovations are<br />\nprohibitive.\"<br />\nCity Councilman Frank Heinz<br />\nalso confirmed that \"HCD<br />\nprograms will have a limited<br />\n<br />\nThe proposal for merit<br />\nscholarships will be brought up<br />\nagain for consideration later this<br />\nsemester by the Committee on<br />\nAdmissions and Academic<br />\n<br />\ninWact on students.\"<br />\n<br />\nServices.<br />\n<br />\nJakie Hall<br />\n<br />\ngeneral growth pattern of the<br />\nUniversity. He says, \"There is<br />\nroom for economies in the<br />\nadministration.\"<br />\nChrist feels that his committee<br />\nhad significant impact on the<br />\nbudget proposals for fiscal year<br />\n1976. Numerous proposals in the<br />\narea of support services were<br />\ndeleted at the panel's request.<br />\nAt Hopkins, the present crisis<br />\nhas had many effects. Christ said<br />\nthat a long range growth plan for<br />\nthe University formulated about<br />\neight years ago was abandoned<br />\nbecause of economic exigencies.<br />\nThe plan called for new Biology,<br />\nSocial Sciences, and Earth and<br />\nPlanetary Sciences buildings, a<br />\nrenovation of Remsen Hall, as<br />\nwell as increases in student<br />\nenrollment and faculty size.<br />\nChrist cited the University's<br />\nloss of noted chemist Dr. Robert<br />\nParr, member of the National<br />\nAcademy of Sciences, as a direct<br />\nresult of Hopkins' financial<br />\nstraits. Christ concluded,<br />\n\"Hopkins just couldn't hold<br />\nhim\u2014we couldn't offer him the<br />\nfacilities another place Could.\"<br />\nIn real dollar terms, faculty<br />\nsalaries have decreased steadily in<br />\n<br />\nrecent years. Budget Director<br />\nKrueger asks, \"How long can we<br />\ndo this?\" As a result of this<br />\nChrist admonishes that it is \"not<br />\nimplaus ible that the faculty<br />\nwould vote to unionize if it felt it<br />\nwere being pushed around.\".<br />\nChrist warns that such a move<br />\nwould be detrimental to the<br />\nquality of Hopkins' faculty<br />\nbecause the University could not<br />\npay higher salaries to the most<br />\ndistinguished.<br />\nFederal funds provide the<br />\nlargest revenue source for<br />\nHopkins. In recent years, Christ<br />\ndiscerns \"a change in federal<br />\npriorities away from education<br />\nand research in general.\"<br />\nIn terms of a long range<br />\nsolution to the economic plight<br />\nof private schools, Krueger<br />\noffers, \"Ultimately there will<br />\nhave to be a change in the<br />\nmethod of funding private<br />\ninstitutions. For the last several<br />\nyears we have spent a<br />\nconsiderable amount of time and<br />\neffort attempting to balance the<br />\nbudget. Something will have to<br />\nchange at the state and federal<br />\nlevel with regards to the funding<br />\nof private schools.\"<br />\n<br />\nScholarships to be reconsidered<br />\n<br />\nThe committee, which tabled<br />\nthe proposal last semester, will<br />\nreconsider the idea with an eye<br />\ntowards implementing the<br />\nscholarships in Fall 1976,<br />\naccording to Larry Denton,<br />\ndirector of Academic Services.<br />\nDenton stated that the<br />\nspecifics of the proposal and<br />\npossible sources of funding have<br />\nyet to be determined. He feels,<br />\nthough, that the committee<br />\n\"should not get tied down in the<br />\ndetails of the proposal.\"<br />\n\"I want to see people consider<br />\nthe idea in principle,\" he said.<br />\n\"Specifics can be ironed out<br />\nlater.\"<br />\nDenton, who supervises the<br />\ncommittee, said he hopes the<br />\n<br />\nproposal will eventually be<br />\ninstituted, though he admits<br />\nstudent and faculty sentiment<br />\nagainst the merit program has<br />\nmade approval unlikely. \"We've<br />\nbeen criticized for the merit<br />\nscholarships for trying to buy<br />\nstudents, but I think the idea has<br />\nsome real value.\"<br />\nHe said he thinks merit<br />\nscholarships would provide a<br />\nsource of financial assistance to<br />\nmiddle income students as well as<br />\naid the University in its<br />\nrecruitment efforts. \"The middle<br />\nclass student is the one bracket<br />\nthat is squeezed out in our<br />\ncurrent method of needs<br />\nanalysis,\" Denton explained.\"We<br />\nhave programs for lower income<br />\nstudents, but nothing of real<br />\nvalue to those in the middle<br />\nincome range.<br />\nHe said this is a serious<br />\npredicament since roughly 70 per<br />\ncent of the Hopkins student<br />\n<br />\nbody, by his estimate, fall into<br />\nthe middle income category.<br />\n\"The middle income student is<br />\nour bread and butter group,\" he<br />\nnoted.<br />\nDenton also said he would like<br />\nto see the merit scholarships<br />\ndistributed in various academic<br />\nareas. \"It would help the<br />\nUniversity's recruiting program<br />\nand the University's reputation in<br />\ngeneral if we could have a merit<br />\nscholarship in the Humanities, or<br />\nother specific areas.\"<br />\n- He also asserted that the<br />\nnotion of scholarship by merit is<br />\nnot inconsistent with University<br />\npolicy, since Hopkins competes<br />\nin a similar fashion for faculty<br />\nand graduate students.<br />\n\"For the faculty you have<br />\nsalaries, .and for the graduate<br />\nstudents there are stipends,\" he<br />\nsaid. \"I don't think it's<br />\ninconsistent to do it on the<br />\nundergraduate level.\"<br />\n<br />\nManaging editor of the Times to lecture<br />\n\u2022 By LIZ WALLACE<br />\nA.

Even as<br />\nRullman lay on the field, some spectators were yelling cheers<br />\nlike \"Who's next, Franz?\" or \"Goodbye Rodney.\" Such<br />\nbehavior is obviously sick and reflects poorly on the crowd as<br />\na whole. A loyal following is a credit to any team: but, when<br />\na following begins to resemble a mob, the team is betrayed.<br />\nWhile Wittelsberger should be reprimanded for his<br />\nunsportsmanlike conduct in this game, he alone is not<br />\nentirely to blame. The question of why a player would want<br />\nto do some \"serious headbustin'\" has to be answered by the<br />\nHopkins athletic department as well as by sports enthusiasts<br />\neverywhere.<br />\nThe answer could be that students here place too great an<br />\nemphasis on winning an athletic event, while forgetting that<br />\nsports are simply games. It is fun and exciting to have a<br />\nchampionship team but the quest of victory should not<br />\ndistort the original meaning of the sport.

Take, for<br />\ninstance, Johns Hopkins. Here we<br />\nhave a small school which happens<br />\nto have a big-time, national power<br />\nin lacrosse. When you mention.<br />\nHopkins, in one breath you say<br />\n\"Medicine\" and in the other you<br />\n<br />\nminutes before<br />\nleave the field<br />\npower, and he<br />\ntaken to the<br />\n<br />\nRullman could<br />\nunder his own<br />\nwas eventually<br />\nhospital in an<br />\n<br />\nambulance.<br />\nAnother dreadful aspect of the<br />\nincident was that a small minority<br />\nof the fans were yelling to get<br />\nRullman off the field so that the<br />\ngame could continue. Besides their<br />\nlack of humanism, these people<br />\nfailed to realize that improperly<br />\n<br />\ncertain that this was not another<br />\nexpensive unplanned accident. Not<br />\neven the Sages of Garland would<br />\nblithely build a spoil dump across a<br />\nriver. No, I think its purpose is<br />\nrather clear. We are going to have<br />\nthis new recreational and aesthetic<br />\nresource destroyed by a<br />\nhydroelectric generating plant built<br />\nto alleviate the so-called campus<br />\nenergy crisis. What genius! My plea<br />\nnow is<br />\n<br />\nor optimal multipuTpose<br />\nw.Vg y=yaxv't<br />\n<br />\na.\u2018<br />\ncf,\"<br />\n<br />\nmeans an awful lot. We are proud<br />\nof our lacroose tradition. But does<br />\nbeing No. 1 come before displaying<br />\nsportsmanship during a game?<br />\nHere is the case in point. It was<br />\nthe third quarter of Saturday's<br />\ngame. Virginia was ahead 8-7.<br />\nHopkins had just failed to score<br />\nand Virginia's goalie and captain,<br />\nRodney Rullman, brought the ball<br />\nup the field. Rullman, who had<br />\nplayed a fine game up until this<br />\npoint and had single-handedly<br />\nthwarted several Hopkins scoring<br />\nopportunities passed off to one of<br />\nhis defensemen. As I was looking<br />\nat the defenseman maneuver, I<br />\nnoticed ,Franz Wittelsburger<br />\nrunning full steam at Rullman.<br />\nWittelsburger hit his helmet into<br />\nthe face mask part of Rullman's<br />\nhelmet, and Rullman was knocked<br />\nto the ground, a 5'9\" 150 pound<br />\nman who did not even have the<br />\nball but was .brutally and<br />\nneedlessly run over by the 6'2\"<br />\n210 pound Hopkins attackman.<br />\nI was appalled by this terrible<br />\nincident. As I watched Rullman<br />\nlaying on the ground after being<br />\nlevelled by the cheap shot, I<br />\nremembered back to my high<br />\nschool days when a player had<br />\nbeen partially paralyzed for life by<br />\nbone -crushing blocks from the<br />\nfront and rear during a football<br />\ngame. There seemed to be one<br />\ndifference: in the high school game<br />\nthe injury was inflicted<br />\nintentionally. I can't help but<br />\nbelieve that Wittelsburger's brutal<br />\nattack on the Virginia goalie was<br />\nseemingly intentional. He had seen<br />\nthe ball being passed off, and he<br />\nhad time to stop, or at least avoid,<br />\nan after-the-play collision with<br />\nRullman.<br />\nI feel that trying to physically<br />\nhurt someone to put him out of a<br />\ngame so that your team can win is<br />\na hateful, disgusting thing. And I<br />\nalso feel that if a Hopkins player,<br />\nor any player for that matter, has<br />\nto purposely hurt another player in<br />\norder to win a game, then the<br />\nguilty player should not be playing<br />\nsports regardless of his abilities<br />\nand the player should realize tha<br />\nis in flagrant violation of the idet<br />\nof sports and of being No. 1 it<br />\nsports. I would not want to be No.<br />\n1 because I was able to put<br />\nopposing players out of the game. I<br />\nwould not want to play sports if I<br />\nhad to do something like that in<br />\norder to win or to play in the<br />\ngame. A hard legal hit\u2014YES;but a<br />\ncheap shot\u2014NO.<br />\nIt took a delay of about 15<br />\n<br />\nIs this what college sports are<br />\ncoming to? I certainly hope not. I<br />\nknow what most of the men and<br />\nwomen who take part in collegiate<br />\nathletics find these sports much<br />\nmore rewarding when they are<br />\nhard-fought, cleanly fought, and<br />\nfought with an outward display of<br />\nsportsmanship. I would hope that,<br />\nas time passes, the qualities of<br />\nsportsmanship, ability and effort<br />\nare the major characteristics of<br />\nsports, not cheap shots that knock<br />\nout opposing players so that your<br />\nteam can win the game in the end.<br />\nBlaise Chromiak<br />\nTo the Editor:<br />\nMonday night, the Hopkins<br />\ncommunity was treated to a<br />\nwonderful show of musical ability<br />\nin the Rathskellar.

I couldn't wait until<br />\n<br />\n\u2014<br />\nOutside, Hopkins' wildlife was<br />\n<br />\nout in force. Squishy worm<br />\ncarcasses littered the rain wet<br />\nasphalt. People feet kill the worms.<br />\nBut, worm slime makes the<br />\nwalkways slippery. And I'm told<br />\nthat worms eat shit.<br />\nThe fourth element of our local<br />\necological balance is the birds. The<br />\nbest place to see them is from the<br />\nfish-bowl. It used to be a common<br />\nthing to hear a thump on the glass<br />\nand see a small bird limping away<br />\nfrom a bloody landing. An<br />\nincredible look of surprise appears<br />\non the face of the bird as the air<br />\nmaterializes in front of his beak.<br />\nSome learn from their mistakes;<br />\nothers, with softer heads, become<br />\nfood for dog and worm. As time<br />\npassed the clever, thick-skulled<br />\nbirds learn to lead the dumber<br />\nbirds right into the mysterious<br />\nmaterializing air, maneuvering<br />\nexpertly to save their own skins.<br />\nBut the hard-to-clean windows<br />\neventually lost their usefulness.<br />\nYears and years ago, the Air<br />\nForce discovered that for some<br />\nreason lots of birds were surviving<br />\nsneak attacks on the jungles where<br />\nthey lived; they would just fly<br />\naway to greener jungles. This<br />\nmessed up the ecological balance<br />\nof the remaining jungles\u2014and the<br />\nproblem grew worse as the jungles<br />\ngrew fewer. Searching their soul,<br />\nand not shirking their<br />\nresponsibility, the Air Force gave a<br />\ngrant to Johns Hopkins to find a<br />\nsolution to the problem.

I don't<br />\nsee the point, 'cause they aren't<br />\nany more direct than the.<br />\nsidewalks. But the administration<br />\ndon't like it. Part of the Hopkins<br />\nexperience is following indirect<br />\npaths to pointless classes, so the<br />\nrationale goes. So they tried<br />\nputting chains across the curbs, but<br />\nthese proved easy to avoid.

The<br />\nopening stanza set the tone for<br />\nthe rest of the game. The<br />\nstickhandling and passing was<br />\nsloppy and that increased as the<br />\nrain did.<br />\nO'Neill hit for two more goals<br />\nin the second quarter to give the<br />\nJays a 6-4 lead with 5:33 left in<br />\nthe half. But the Wahoos came<br />\nback to knot the halftime score<br />\nat 6-6 with Scooter Dorney<br />\nputting in a rebound of a missed<br />\nshot twenty four seconds prior to<br />\nthe intermission.<br />\nWith the score Virginia 8,<br />\nHopkins 7, and 13:22 left in the<br />\ngame, Virginia was setting up a<br />\nclear with goalie Rodney<br />\nRullman in possession of the ball<br />\njust inside the restraining line.<br />\nRullman released the ball and<br />\nwas then decked by Blue Jay<br />\n<br />\nattackman Franz Wittelsberger.<br />\nThis hit put the Cavalier goalie<br />\nout of the game. His replacement<br />\nCam McLachlan responded<br />\nbrilliantly and as Virginia Coach<br />\nGlenn Thiel noted, \"It is always<br />\ntough to use a freshman in such a<br />\nsituation and doubly so when<br />\nyou are playing Hopkins at<br />\nHomewood before that partisan<br />\ncrowd. His performance was<br />\nexcellent.\" He certainly had<br />\nnothing to do with the eventual<br />\nWahoo defeat.<br />\nWittelsberger tied the game on<br />\na beautiful unassisted goal with<br />\n8:31 left in the game.

It is earmarked for<br />\nspecific. uses.\" Krueger explains<br />\nthat this restricted endowment<br />\ncannot be used to offset general<br /><br />\nCooperation not .<br />\napparent from area<br />\nBy JAN HAMMERMAN<br />\nThe University called for a<br />\n\"new understanding\" between<br />\nHopkins and the. Homewood<br />\ncommunity regarding the student<br />\nhousing problem at a meeting last<br />\nnight sponsored by the GHCC<br />\nand Hopkins.<br />\nHowever, the spirit of<br />\ncooperation was not apparent as<br />\nseveral residents not only<br />\nopposed a possible University<br />\npurchase of housing, but also<br />\nprotested the prospect of student<br />\nresidents at all.<br />\nDick Cook, executive director<br />\nof the GHCC,firmly stated that a<br />\nmajor sale of housing units would<br />\n\"be of great concern to the<br />\nresidents because it would bring<br />\nmassive changes in the present<br />\nneighborhood.\"<br />\nOne resident of Charles Village<br />\nsaki Werll fighrthel Uttiversity if 2'<br />\nthey try to buy housing.<br />\nStudents just don't regard this<br />\narea as a community.\" Other<br />\nresidents cited unfavorable cases<br />\nwhere students have neglected<br />\nthe upkeep. of their residences<br />\nand made excessive noise.<br />\nHowever, Dean of Students'<br />\nJakie Hall replied \"that the<br />\nstudents have made housing a<br />\nhigh priority.\"<br />\nHall cited the election of Mike<br />\nLenardo, Chain- an of the SC<br />\nHousing Comm, tee, the Senior<br />\nClass housing fund, and a host of<br />\ncomplaints about housing he has<br />\nheard this past \u2022eek in support<br />\nof his contention.<br />\nThe Dean revealed that he's<br />\nupset- about the inability of<br />\nfemales, Blacks, and other<br />\nminority, students to secure<br />\nhousing in the area. Furthermore,<br />\nHall expressed disgust at<br />\nlandlords who \"have ripped off<br />\nHopkins students.\"<br />\nLenard\u00b0 and Dean Hall stated<br />\nthat the situation is critical in the<br />\nface of the rising Hopkins'<br />\nstudent population and the<br />\nlimited number of<br />\nUniversity-owned units. In a<br />\nletter sent to Homewood-area<br />\nresidents, Hall claimed that there<br />\nis an \"immediate need\" for \"250<br />\nadditional housing units.\"<br />\n\"I've had upset students in my<br />\noffice,\" stated Hall, \"who, even<br />\nbefore the lottery, have been<br />\nunable to find housing after<br />\nlooking for months.\"<br />\nBaltimore City's Housing and<br />\nCommunity Development<br />\nAgency was also present at the<br />\nmeeting and although they did<br />\nnot have specific solutions, did<br />\npromise to \"follow up on student<br />\nhousing complaints.\"<br /><br />\noperational 'deficits.<br />\nDr. Carl Christ, Political<br />\nEconomy, observes that in the<br />\npast year the value of Hopkins'<br />\nendowment has plummeted alone<br />\nwith the stock market.<br />\nChrist added, though, that th(<br />\nincome from the endowment ha:<br />\nnot decreased. Of late, th(<br />\nUniversity has not been buyinf<br />\nstocks with new gifts, but ha.<br />\ninstead purchased short-tern<br />\nnotes yielding high interests. Thi:<br />\nis one reason the budget has been<br />\nbalanced for the last several<br />\nyears, according to Christ.<br />\nAs chairman of President<br />\nMuller's Ad Hoc Budgetary<br />\nCommittee,'Christ is very much<br />\naware of the problems currently<br />\nfacing private instutions in the<br />\npresent economic turmoil.<br />\n\"Private colleges won't do a<br />\ngood job in the present pinch if<br />\nwe don't know what we want to<br />\ndo,\" Christ continued, \"we can't<br />\nafford to do everything. There<br />\nare choices which have to be<br />\nmade in light of our mission.\"<br />\nIn this light, Christ's ad hoc<br />\ncommittee pressed for an<br />\nin-depth analysis of the growth<br />\nof supportive services versus the<br /><br />\nCharles Noon of HCD<br />\nsuggested that the \"University go<br />\ninto the housing market and lease<br />\nresidence's to students.\"<br />\nHowever, Noon continued that<br />\nthis situation is \"not the city's<br />\nproblem,\" and asserted that \"the<br />\nHCD cannot intervene between<br />\nthe community adn the school.\"<br />\nAdditionally, Roger Windsor<br />\nof the city's Home Ownership<br />\nOffice regarded the possibility of<br />\nstudent-purchased homes in<br />\neither cooperatives or through a<br />\ncondominium arrangement as<br />\n\"impractical.\" \"Not only is the<br />\nstudent population transient,\" he<br />\nexplained, \"but the cost of a<br />\nmortgage and renovations are<br />\nprohibitive.\"<br />\nCity Councilman Frank Heinz<br />\nalso confirmed that \"HCD<br />\nprograms will have a limited<br /><br />\nThe proposal for merit<br />\nscholarships will be brought up<br />\nagain for consideration later this<br />\nsemester by the Committee on<br />\nAdmissions and Academic<br /><br />\ninWact on students.\"<br /><br />\nServices.<br /><br />\nJakie Hall<br /><br />\ngeneral growth pattern of the<br />\nUniversity. He says, \"There is<br />\nroom for economies in the<br />\nadministration.\"<br />\nChrist feels that his committee<br />\nhad significant impact on the<br />\nbudget proposals for fiscal year<br />\n1976. Numerous proposals in the<br />\narea of support services were<br />\ndeleted at the panel's request.<br />\nAt Hopkins, the present crisis<br />\nhas had many effects. Christ said<br />\nthat a long range growth plan for<br />\nthe University formulated about<br />\neight years ago was abandoned<br />\nbecause of economic exigencies.<br />\nThe plan called for new Biology,<br />\nSocial Sciences, and Earth and<br />\nPlanetary Sciences buildings, a<br />\nrenovation of Remsen Hall, as<br />\nwell as increases in student<br />\nenrollment and faculty size.<br />\nChrist cited the University's<br />\nloss of noted chemist Dr. Robert<br />\nParr, member of the National<br />\nAcademy of Sciences, as a direct<br />\nresult of Hopkins' financial<br />\nstraits. Christ concluded,<br />\n\"Hopkins just couldn't hold<br />\nhim\u2014we couldn't offer him the<br />\nfacilities another place Could.\"<br />\nIn real dollar terms, faculty<br />\nsalaries have decreased steadily in<br /><br />\nrecent years. Budget Director<br />\nKrueger asks, \"How long can we<br />\ndo this?\" As a result of this<br />\nChrist admonishes that it is \"not<br />\nimplaus ible that the faculty<br />\nwould vote to unionize if it felt it<br />\nwere being pushed around.\".<br />\nChrist warns that such a move<br />\nwould be detrimental to the<br />\nquality of Hopkins' faculty<br />\nbecause the University could not<br />\npay higher salaries to the most<br />\ndistinguished.<br />\nFederal funds provide the<br />\nlargest revenue source for<br />\nHopkins. In recent years, Christ<br />\ndiscerns \"a change in federal<br />\npriorities away from education<br />\nand research in general.\"<br />\nIn terms of a long range<br />\nsolution to the economic plight<br />\nof private schools, Krueger<br />\noffers, \"Ultimately there will<br />\nhave to be a change in the<br />\nmethod of funding private<br />\ninstitutions. For the last several<br />\nyears we have spent a<br />\nconsiderable amount of time and<br />\neffort attempting to balance the<br />\nbudget. Something will have to<br />\nchange at the state and federal<br />\nlevel with regards to the funding<br />\nof private schools.\"<br /><br />\nScholarships to be reconsidered<br /><br />\nThe committee, which tabled<br />\nthe proposal last semester, will<br />\nreconsider the idea with an eye<br />\ntowards implementing the<br />\nscholarships in Fall 1976,<br />\naccording to Larry Denton,<br />\ndirector of Academic Services.<br />\nDenton stated that the<br />\nspecifics of the proposal and<br />\npossible sources of funding have<br />\nyet to be determined. He feels,<br />\nthough, that the committee<br />\n\"should not get tied down in the<br />\ndetails of the proposal.\"<br />\n\"I want to see people consider<br />\nthe idea in principle,\" he said.<br />\n\"Specifics can be ironed out<br />\nlater.\"<br />\nDenton, who supervises the<br />\ncommittee, said he hopes the<br /><br />\nproposal will eventually be<br />\ninstituted, though he admits<br />\nstudent and faculty sentiment<br />\nagainst the merit program has<br />\nmade approval unlikely. \"We've<br />\nbeen criticized for the merit<br />\nscholarships for trying to buy<br />\nstudents, but I think the idea has<br />\nsome real value.\"<br />\nHe said he thinks merit<br />\nscholarships would provide a<br />\nsource of financial assistance to<br />\nmiddle income students as well as<br />\naid the University in its<br />\nrecruitment efforts. \"The middle<br />\nclass student is the one bracket<br />\nthat is squeezed out in our<br />\ncurrent method of needs<br />\nanalysis,\" Denton explained.\"We<br />\nhave programs for lower income<br />\nstudents, but nothing of real<br />\nvalue to those in the middle<br />\nincome range.<br />\nHe said this is a serious<br />\npredicament since roughly 70 per<br />\ncent of the Hopkins student<br /><br />\nbody, by his estimate, fall into<br />\nthe middle income category.<br />\n\"The middle income student is<br />\nour bread and butter group,\" he<br />\nnoted.<br />\nDenton also said he would like<br />\nto see the merit scholarships<br />\ndistributed in various academic<br />\nareas. \"It would help the<br />\nUniversity's recruiting program<br />\nand the University's reputation in<br />\ngeneral if we could have a merit<br />\nscholarship in the Humanities, or<br />\nother specific areas.\"<br />\n- He also asserted that the<br />\nnotion of scholarship by merit is<br />\nnot inconsistent with University<br />\npolicy, since Hopkins competes<br />\nin a similar fashion for faculty<br />\nand graduate students.<br />\n\"For the faculty you have<br />\nsalaries, .and for the graduate<br />\nstudents there are stipends,\" he<br />\nsaid. \"I don't think it's<br />\ninconsistent to do it on the<br />\nundergraduate level.\"<br /><br />\nManaging editor of the Times to lecture<br />\n\u2022 By LIZ WALLACE<br />\nA.

Even as<br />\nRullman lay on the field, some spectators were yelling cheers<br />\nlike \"Who's next, Franz?\" or \"Goodbye Rodney.\" Such<br />\nbehavior is obviously sick and reflects poorly on the crowd as<br />\na whole. A loyal following is a credit to any team: but, when<br />\na following begins to resemble a mob, the team is betrayed.<br />\nWhile Wittelsberger should be reprimanded for his<br />\nunsportsmanlike conduct in this game, he alone is not<br />\nentirely to blame. The question of why a player would want<br />\nto do some \"serious headbustin'\" has to be answered by the<br />\nHopkins athletic department as well as by sports enthusiasts<br />\neverywhere.<br />\nThe answer could be that students here place too great an<br />\nemphasis on winning an athletic event, while forgetting that<br />\nsports are simply games. It is fun and exciting to have a<br />\nchampionship team but the quest of victory should not<br />\ndistort the original meaning of the sport.

Take, for<br />\ninstance, Johns Hopkins. Here we<br />\nhave a small school which happens<br />\nto have a big-time, national power<br />\nin lacrosse. When you mention.<br />\nHopkins, in one breath you say<br />\n\"Medicine\" and in the other you<br /><br />\nminutes before<br />\nleave the field<br />\npower, and he<br />\ntaken to the<br /><br />\nRullman could<br />\nunder his own<br />\nwas eventually<br />\nhospital in an<br /><br />\nambulance.<br />\nAnother dreadful aspect of the<br />\nincident was that a small minority<br />\nof the fans were yelling to get<br />\nRullman off the field so that the<br />\ngame could continue. Besides their<br />\nlack of humanism, these people<br />\nfailed to realize that improperly<br /><br />\ncertain that this was not another<br />\nexpensive unplanned accident. Not<br />\neven the Sages of Garland would<br />\nblithely build a spoil dump across a<br />\nriver. No, I think its purpose is<br />\nrather clear. We are going to have<br />\nthis new recreational and aesthetic<br />\nresource destroyed by a<br />\nhydroelectric generating plant built<br />\nto alleviate the so-called campus<br />\nenergy crisis. What genius! My plea<br />\nnow is<br /><br />\nor optimal multipuTpose<br />\nw.Vg y=yaxv't<br /><br />\na.\u2018<br />\ncf,\"<br /><br />\nmeans an awful lot. We are proud<br />\nof our lacroose tradition. But does<br />\nbeing No. 1 come before displaying<br />\nsportsmanship during a game?<br />\nHere is the case in point. It was<br />\nthe third quarter of Saturday's<br />\ngame. Virginia was ahead 8-7.<br />\nHopkins had just failed to score<br />\nand Virginia's goalie and captain,<br />\nRodney Rullman, brought the ball<br />\nup the field. Rullman, who had<br />\nplayed a fine game up until this<br />\npoint and had single-handedly<br />\nthwarted several Hopkins scoring<br />\nopportunities passed off to one of<br />\nhis defensemen. As I was looking<br />\nat the defenseman maneuver, I<br />\nnoticed ,Franz Wittelsburger<br />\nrunning full steam at Rullman.<br />\nWittelsburger hit his helmet into<br />\nthe face mask part of Rullman's<br />\nhelmet, and Rullman was knocked<br />\nto the ground, a 5'9\" 150 pound<br />\nman who did not even have the<br />\nball but was .brutally and<br />\nneedlessly run over by the 6'2\"<br />\n210 pound Hopkins attackman.<br />\nI was appalled by this terrible<br />\nincident. As I watched Rullman<br />\nlaying on the ground after being<br />\nlevelled by the cheap shot, I<br />\nremembered back to my high<br />\nschool days when a player had<br />\nbeen partially paralyzed for life by<br />\nbone -crushing blocks from the<br />\nfront and rear during a football<br />\ngame. There seemed to be one<br />\ndifference: in the high school game<br />\nthe injury was inflicted<br />\nintentionally. I can't help but<br />\nbelieve that Wittelsburger's brutal<br />\nattack on the Virginia goalie was<br />\nseemingly intentional. He had seen<br />\nthe ball being passed off, and he<br />\nhad time to stop, or at least avoid,<br />\nan after-the-play collision with<br />\nRullman.<br />\nI feel that trying to physically<br />\nhurt someone to put him out of a<br />\ngame so that your team can win is<br />\na hateful, disgusting thing. And I<br />\nalso feel that if a Hopkins player,<br />\nor any player for that matter, has<br />\nto purposely hurt another player in<br />\norder to win a game, then the<br />\nguilty player should not be playing<br />\nsports regardless of his abilities<br />\nand the player should realize tha<br />\nis in flagrant violation of the idet<br />\nof sports and of being No. 1 it<br />\nsports.

This<br />\nmessed up the ecological balance<br />\nof the remaining jungles\u2014and the<br />\nproblem grew worse as the jungles<br />\ngrew fewer.

Va. opener<br />\nBy STEPHEN LEVIN Believe it or not, Coach Henry<br />\nCiccarone of the Hopkins varsity<br />\nlacrosse team still has black hair!<br />\nDespite the Blue Jays 10-9<br />\novertime victory over the<br />\nUniversity of Virginia Cavaliers at<br />\nHomewood Field on Saturday in<br />\nCiccarone's first game as the Blue<br />\nJay head coach, the Homewood<br />\nmentor survived a heart-stopping<br />\npremier.<br />\nLed by freshman Mike<br />\nO'Neill's two goals (he ended up<br />\nwith five) the Jays led 3-2 at the<br />\nend of the first quarter. The<br />\nopening stanza set the tone for<br />\nthe rest of the game. The<br />\nstickhandling and passing was<br />\nsloppy and that increased as the<br />\nrain did.<br />\nO'Neill hit for two more goals<br />\nin the second quarter to give the<br />\nJays a 6-4 lead with 5:33 left in<br />\nthe half. But the Wahoos came<br />\nback to knot the halftime score<br />\nat 6-6 with Scooter Dorney<br />\nputting in a rebound of a missed<br />\nshot twenty four seconds prior to<br />\nthe intermission.<br />\nWith the score Virginia 8,<br />\nHopkins 7, and 13:22 left in the<br />\ngame, Virginia was setting up a<br />\nclear with goalie Rodney<br />\nRullman in possession of the ball<br />\njust inside the restraining line.<br />\nRullman released the ball and<br />\nwas then decked by Blue Jay<br /><br />\nattackman Franz Wittelsberger.<br />\nThis hit put the Cavalier goalie<br />\nout of the game. His replacement<br />\nCam McLachlan responded<br />\nbrilliantly and as Virginia Coach<br />\nGlenn Thiel noted, \"It is always<br />\ntough to use a freshman in such a<br />\nsituation and doubly so when<br />\nyou are playing Hopkins at<br />\nHomewood before that partisan<br />\ncrowd. His performance was<br />\nexcellent.\" He certainly had<br />\nnothing to do with the eventual<br />\nWahoo defeat.<br />\nWittelsberger tied the game on<br />\na beautiful unassisted goal with<br />\n8:31 left in the game. Then with<br />\nthree minutes remaining the Blue<br />\nJays took possession of the ball<br />\nand Coach Ciccarone ordered the<br />\nJays to stall and hold for one<br />\nshot, which failed.<br />\nIn lacrosse, overtime consists<br />\nof two four-minute periods. The<br />\nfirst one was scoreless. In the<br />\nsecond period Virginia moved<br />\nahead 9-8 before Rich Hirsch<br />\ntook a Don Zimmerman feed in<br />\nfront of the net and knotted the<br />\nscore at nine with 1:59<br />\nremaining. Mike O'Neill (see<br />\nAthlete of the Week) then fired<br />\nin his fifth goal of the game with<br />\nthree second to go to give the<br />\nJays the win.<br />\nIn response to the furor over<br />\n\"Witt's Hit,\" coaches went over<br />\nthe game films and Coach<br /><br />\nCiccarone concluded, \"That play<br />\nwhile definitely being a late hit<br />\nWas certainly not a cheap shot.<br />\nFranz started off fifteen yards<br />\nfrom Rullman, running full speed<br />\nat him when Rullman had the<br />\nball. The Virginia goalie then<br />\nreleased, the ball when Witt was<br />\nthree yards from him.
