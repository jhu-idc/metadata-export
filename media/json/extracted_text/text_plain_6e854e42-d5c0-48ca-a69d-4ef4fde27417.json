Al-Shabkhoun<br />\nCutting the number of student advisors by one-third may<br />\nseem an odd way to introduce<br />\n742 freshmen to Hopkins, but<br />\nOrientation '86 \"was really successful\" according to Orientation Chairman Mary Hiatt.<br />\nIndeed, according to Hiatt,<br />\nthe continued success of Orientation '86 depends on the<br />\nunusually small number of student advisors. \"The number of<br />\nadvisors was cut down to get<br />\nthe most dedicated people only,\" said Hiatt. A problem that<br />\nfaces all orientations is that to<br />\n\"continue the momentum<br />\nfound during orientation,\" according to Hiatt. By picking<br />\nonly those students who seemed most dedicated, this year<br />\nHiatt hopes that the orientation<br />\nadvisors will develop stronger<br />\nand more lasting relationships.<br />\n\"You can't say that after four<br />\nor five days students are<br />\noriented,\" remarked Hiatt. \"It<br />\ncan be a two or three year process\" with advisors facing such<br />\nproblems as finding off-campus<br />\nhousing after freshman year.<br />\nHiatt admitted that \"certainly there were some disadvantages with the smaller number<br />\nof advisors. Having each advisor assigned to five advisees<br />\n[instead of the regular three or<br />\nfour] puts a lot of pressure on<br />\npeople.\"<br />\nOther changes also contributed to the success of Orientation '86. Among these was<br />\nthe introduction of team leaders<br />\nwhose work included helping<br />\nthe committee chairmen and<br />\nassisting with public relations.<br />\nA more thorough and interactive advisor training program<br />\nincluding role playing and<br />\ngroup dynamics exercises was<br />\nalso an aspect of orientation<br />\nthat Hiatt hopes will continue.<br />\nThe activities included annual events such as the square<br />\ndance and Motown Night and<br />\nnew activities such as casino<br />\nnight and a dance held at<br />\nCignels. The Cignels night,<br />\nopen to freshmen and advisors<br />\nof Hopkins, Goucher and<br />\nNotre Dame, was so successful<br />\nthat it was \"too crowded\" according to Hiatt. \"I was shocked by the turn-out. I thought<br />\nthat the freshmen would be<br />\ntired-out by Tuesday,\" she<br />\ncontinued.<br />\nSome events such as the new<br />\nwave dance that had been<br />\npopular in the past were replaced with fresher ideas.\"We quit<br />\nhaving the new wave dance<br />\nsince new wave is out,\" commented Hiatt, \"and we had the<br />\nvideo dance instead.\"<br />\nHaving first hand experience<br />\nwith orientation, Hiatt still<br />\nthinks that it can be improved.<br />\n\"One thing that we need more<br />\nof is dorm activities,\" stated<br />\nHiatt,\"we don't need as many<br />\nbig danLes.\" She added that,<br />\n\"Freshmen tend to associate<br />\nwith those few people that<br />\nthey've met and feel comfortable with\" at large dances instead of meeting new people.<br />\n<br />\nWhat orientation needs is<br />\n\"more smaller activities,<br />\nalthough the planning is much<br />\nmore difficult,\" she admitted.<br />\nHiatt remarked that problems resulting from dealing<br />\nwith Hopkins' largest freshman<br />\nclass were few and minor for<br />\nthe orientation staff. \"It went<br />\npretty well,\" commented Hiatt,<br />\n\"It's just that everything costs<br />\nmore.\"<br />\nFunding for orientation was<br />\nnot limited to one source,<br />\nalthough the Office of Residential Life did lay-out the vast<br />\nmajority of the budget.

The past two freshman<br />\nclasses, though relatively large<br />\nin simple numbers, actually had<br />\nsmaller yields than expected.<br />\nThis motivated the Admissions Committee to be slightly<br />\nmore liberal this year in its acceptances so that a target<br />\nnumber of 670 students would<br />\nenroll.

The fact that we have a<br />\ntotally new council [only five of<br />\nlast year's members will sit on<br />\ncouncil this fall] will also present new challenges.\"<br />\nSince the University decided<br />\nto transfer operation of WJHU<br />\nfrom student control to professional management, the limited<br />\nopportunities for student participation have stirred up much<br />\nprotest from undergraduates,<br />\nincluding an ad-hoc council<br />\ncommittee last year. Komisky<br />\nbelieves that the University has<br />\na responsibility to maintain<br />\nopen channels of communication between the radio management and the students.<br />\n\"I've attempted to get them<br />\n[Provost Richard Longaker and<br />\nVice President for Communications B.J. Norris] to write a letter to all undergraduates on the<br />\nstatus of WJHU past, present,<br />\nand future, in hopes that it will<br />\neducate students as opposed to<br />\nleaving them in the dark as they<br />\nhave been in the past,\"<br />\nKomisky explained.<br />\n\"The administration has also<br />\nappointed an advisory board<br />\nfor WJHU of which I am a<br />\nmember\u2014the only student<br />\nmember,\" Komisky added.<br />\n\"The advisory board is an attempt to consult more with the<br />\nradio station. I would like to see<br />\nat least one other student on the<br />\nboard.\" The board is composed of about 25 persons, mostly<br />\nrepresentatives of the faculty<br />\nand administration.<br />\n\"The Student Council will<br />\nundoubtedly examine the recent<br />\nproposal for a [student-run]<br />\ncarrier station,\" commented<br />\nKomisky. Another service being discussed is the creation of<br />\na WJHU stop on the<br />\nHomewood-JHMI Shuttle.<br />\n\"Dean Colombo seemed very<br />\nenthusiastic about the idea,\"<br />\nsaid Komisky. The offices of<br />\nWJHU are located at 2216<br />\nNorth Charles Street.<br />\nThe council also hopes to be<br />\na participant in the University's<br />\ndecision-making process concerning student housing and the<br />\nfate of the Wolman-McCoy<br />\nApartments. According to<br />\nKomisky, University President<br />\nSteven Muller has formed a<br />\nspecial committee of the<br />\ntrustees to examine the housing<br />\nproblem.<br />\n\"The University has two<br />\nyears to act in order to use a<br />\nloan it has been granted for<br />\nhousing improvements,\" said<br />\nKomisky. \"The administration<br />\nmust decide whether to<br />\n<br />\nrenovate Wolman and McCoy<br />\nor just raze the buildings and<br />\nstart over. If the decision is<br />\nmade to rebuild, the council<br />\nwants to be sure that students<br />\nresiding there at that time are<br />\ngiven opportunity to relocate.\"<br />\nIn light of recent tensions<br />\nbetween fraternities and the<br />\nUniversity administration,<br />\nKomisky commented that \"the<br />\ncouncil would like to find some<br />\nway of working with the IFC<br />\n[Inter-Fraternity Council]...hut<br />\nsince the IFC is the student<br />\ngroup with jurisdiction over the<br />\nGreeks, the council will probably have a more limited<br />\nrole.\"<br />\nWhile last year's council was<br />\ngenerally viewed as \"serviceoriented\" rather than dealing<br />\neffectively with broader issues,<br />\nKomisky hopes that his administration will strike a<br />\nbalance between the two. \"I<br />\nconsider both services and<br />\nmoral issues equally important.<br />\nAs a political science major I<br />\nhave both a realistic approach<br />\nand a theoretical interest in<br />\nworld issues,\" he explained.<br />\nHowever Komisky is hopeful<br />\nfor many improvements in student services this school year.<br />\nUnder the leadership of cochairpersons Heidi Wald and<br />\nJanine Unterreiner, the Student<br />\nServices Committee will \"try to<br />\nwork out the bugs in programs<br />\nwhich were started last year.\"<br />\nKomisky believes that Wald<br />\nand Unterreiner, both former<br />\nSSC members, will provide the<br />\nexperience necessary to continue the programs established<br />\nlast semester. \"I'd like to see<br />\nreal improvements,\" he added,<br />\n\"even if that means fewer<br />\nprojects.\"<br />\nKomisky would also like to<br />\nmodify the format of Student<br />\nCouncil meetings in an effort to<br />\nincrease enthusiasm among the<br />\nmembers and to encourage student attendance.<br />\nStudent Council meetings are<br />\nheld every Wednesday at 8 p.m.<br />\n<br />\nCourtesy of News and Information<br />\n<br />\nNoon-time picnickers and passersby were treated to a demonstration of drum-heating, gongbanging, and 'animalbatics' Wednesday in front of Levering Hall.<br />\nThis show, presented by the Tai Vim Ming Fu Lion Dancers of Wheaton, Maryland, wa%<br />\nheld in celebration of the opening in China of the Hopkins Nanjing Center for International<br />\nStudies.<br />\nAmong those delighting in the dance were Mary.

Both<br />\ndevelopments were initiated by the<br />\nUniversity administration and both were<br />\noutlined in a curt policy statement which<br />\nappeared in the Gazette last week.<br />\nThe first announcement concerned the<br />\nissue of divestment directly. According<br />\nto the statement issued by the adminstration, the Executive Committee of the<br />\nBoard of Trustees has asked the Investment Committee to reconsider its policy<br />\nof investing in companies that do<br />\nbusiness in South Africa. We applaud<br />\nthat move.<br />\nLast year, we took a strong stand in<br />\nfavor of divestment arguing that a<br />\nuniversity's mission extends beyond<br />\nfinancial well-being. We said at the time<br />\nthat Hopkins should not profit from investments which support the South<br />\nAfrican regime. Instead, we argued,<br />\nHopkins should stand for values\u2014values<br />\nwhich were certainly being violated in<br />\nSouth Africa.<br />\nThis year, following a summer of everincreasing repression on the part of the<br />\nwhite minority government in South<br />\nAfrica, we are even more stalwart in our<br />\nconviction that Hopkins ought to divest.<br />\nThe decision to reconsider Hopkins' investment policy, therefore, seems like a<br />\nstep in the right direction.<br />\nIn some circles, the move has been<br />\ncriticized as little more than an attempt<br />\nto pass the buck to yet another committee. However, the decision to have the<br />\nInvestment Committee reconsider<br />\nHopkins' investments seems to be the appropriate starting place for a change in<br />\ninvestment policy. In dealing with matters of such potential financial consequence to the university, it is prudent to<br />\nmove slowly, carefully, and deliberately. Hopefully, the move to reconsider the<br />\ninvestments will be a prelude to<br />\nthoughtful and considered action leading<br />\nto complete divestment.<br />\nBut while we commend the adminstration for its decision to reconsider the<br />\nuniversity's investments in South Africa,<br />\n<br />\nwe must take exception to the second<br />\npolicy announced in the Gazette which<br />\nwould effectively ban the construction of<br />\n\"unauthorized structures on University<br />\nproperty\"\u2014an obvious reference to the<br />\nprotest shanties and gulag that were<br />\nerected on the lower quad at the end of<br />\nlast semester.<br />\nIn his commencement address last<br />\nMay, University President Steven Muller<br />\ntold graduating members of the university that shanties and gulags are provocative by nature. And, he argued, such<br />\nprovocation has a proper place in a<br />\nuniversity.<br />\nMuller was absolutely right.<br />\nThe nonviolent expression and exchange of ideas not only \"has a proper<br />\nplace\" in a university, but is essential to<br />\na healthy learning environment. A<br />\nuniversity of all places ought to be a free<br />\nforum for the kind of intellectual exchange which characterized the South<br />\nAfrican divestment debate and<br />\nmotivated the construction of the shanties and the gulag.<br />\nSo, when the Executive Committee announced its decision to ban such<br />\n\"demonstrations of conviction,\" as<br />\nMuller put it, and arrest those who attempt to display their beliefs in the form<br />\nof protest shanties and gulags, the adminstration struck a serious blow to the<br />\nvery mission of the University. The adminstration may very well have the legal<br />\nright to outlaw such structures since the<br />\nUniversity is a private institution, but<br />\nthat right should not be exercised.<br />\nIn all likelihood, the adminstration's<br />\nnewly announced shanty-ban was made<br />\nwith the good intention of preventing the<br />\nkind of violence that occured in May.<br />\nBut banning forms of nonviolent protest<br />\nis not the answer. The University's<br />\nenergies could more profitably be spent<br />\nin attempting to change the attitudes of<br />\nthose who would use force to silence<br />\nothers. Educational programs similar to<br />\nthose proposed by the Coalition are a<br />\nmuch wiser alternative to an outright ban<br />\non protest.<br />\nToday, on the ninth aniversary of the<br />\ndeath of Steven Biko, the slain South<br />\nAfrican Black Consciousness leader, the<br />\nUniversity and the Coalition seem headed for a show-down. Plans are underway<br />\nto erect a shantytown this afternoon, and<br />\nthe university adminstration will have to<br />\ndecide whether or not it will hold fast to<br />\nits new policy.<br />\nIn the end, if the new shanty-ban is enforced, the adminstration may find itself<br />\ncontinuing what the firebombers<br />\nstarted\u2014using force and violence to<br />\nsilence the opinions of others.<br />\n<br />\nThe lead front page story of<br />\nthe September 2 Gazette contained a statement by University Trustees and the President<br />\nconcerning the University's<br />\nSouth Africa-related investments as well as a prohibition against \"unauthorized<br />\nconstruction\", presumably<br />\nmeaning a shantytown.<br />\nWe have begun to lose faith<br />\nin the decision-making process<br />\n<br />\nare provocative. Within a<br />\nuniversity, rational provocation<br />\nhas a proper place, and can and<br />\nshould elicit rational response.\"<br />\nThe logic of the statement<br />\nprinted in The Gazette\u2014<br />\nparticularly in arguing that the<br />\n\"unauthorized structures present a danger to safety of persons and property\"\u2014is specious, considering the University Administration's own<br />\n<br />\ngordon lewis<br />\nof the Board on the divestment<br />\nissue, because at every turn, the<br />\nbuck is passed to another committee. Our several attempts to<br />\ncommunicate with each of the<br />\nseventy-odd Trustees have<br />\nessentially been met with silence<br />\non their part. Since 23 of these<br />\nTrustees (at last count) are<br />\nthemselves employed by companies doing business in South<br />\nAfrica, the Board's unresponsible and inconsistent handling<br />\nof divestment raises conflict of<br />\ninterest concerns.<br />\nWe feel that this issue is of<br />\nsuch importance that the<br />\ndecision-making process be<br />\nopen to public consideration.<br />\nWe therefore request a substantive role in the \"complete reappraisal\" of University divestment policy to be conducted by<br />\nthe Investment Committee.<br />\nWe.are disturbed by the Executive Committee's refusal to<br />\nallow the rebuilding of an<br />\neducational shantytown, and<br />\nby their threat that in building<br />\nshanties, we students, staff and<br />\nfaculty \"will be treated as<br />\ntrespassers.\" This calls into<br />\nquestion the University's commitment to a free and open<br />\ndiscourse, and contradicts<br />\nPresident Muller's Commencement statement of May 30:<br />\n\"Shantytowns and other<br />\ndemonstrations of conviction<br />\n<br />\nnegligence surrounding the<br />\nMay 24 firebombing attack on<br />\nthe Coalition for a Free South<br />\nAfrica shantytown. The<br />\nUniversity failed, even after the<br />\nMay 7th cinderblock attack, to<br />\ntake the mildest precautionary<br />\nmeasures to prevent further<br />\nviolence.<br />\nWe will not take the Executive Committee's heavyhanded threat seriously, and<br />\nwill renew our efforts this fall<br />\ntowards fulfilling the desires of<br />\nthe majority of oppressed black<br />\nSouth Africans, including the<br />\ntotal divestment of this University's $70 million South Africarelated portfolio.<br />\n<br />\nOp-Ed Policy<br />\nThe News-Letter welcomes<br />\ncontributions to the op-ed<br />\ncolumn.

Yet one of<br />\nthe summer's biggest hits there<br />\nis called \"Happy Hour,\" and<br />\nwhatever irony there is in that<br />\ntitle is obscured by the<br />\nrelentlessly upbeat melody.<br />\n<br />\nThe Housemartins, creators<br />\nof \"Happy Hour\" and a load<br />\nof other exuberant tunes, are<br />\nrepresentative of a bright trend<br />\nin British music\u2014guitar-pop<br />\nbands who shun the anger and<br />\nanarchy of '70s punk and hardcore, preferring to look back to<br />\nthe days of '60s innocence and<br />\nwhimsy (one band even covered<br />\n\"Itsy Bitsy Teeny Weeny<br />\nYellow Polka Dot Bikini,\" and<br />\neverybody's doing Norman<br />\nGreenbaum's hippie-clippy<br />\n\"Spirit in the Sky\"). In London, there's a flourishing live<br />\nscene, and three or four dollars<br />\nis enough to gain admission to<br />\nsmall clubs like the Timebox,<br />\nwhere there are often several<br />\nbands on the night's bill. Many<br />\nof them are purveyors of this<br />\nPositive Pop sound; Mighty<br />\nMighty, the Close Lobsters,<br />\nWe've Got A Fuzzbox and<br />\nWe're Gonna Use It, the Wedding Present, and the Shop<br />\nAssistants are some of the best.<br />\n<br />\ncharts. A few of these singles<br />\nwere collected on the \"Well<br />\nWell Well\" album, released last<br />\nspring on the American indie<br />\nUpside. There is real tension<br />\nand a fiery passion in those<br />\nsongs; \"Move Me,\" for instance, builds up to a fever<br />\npitch before exploding into an<br />\ninevitable, song-ending scream,<br />\nand \"Steady Steady\" boils over<br />\nwith the anguish of a man who<br />\nis losing a friend to some<br />\nnameless disease. The Woodentops' first album proper, Giant,<br />\nreleased here on Columbia<br />\nRecords, is a little more<br />\nrestrained. But the old hyperactivity still reigns in some cuts<br />\nlike \"Get It On\" and<br />\n\"Travellin' Man.\"<br />\nGiant is a record to cherish<br />\nfor the way it makes you feel,<br />\na rarity among all the soulless<br />\ntechno in today's Top 40. With<br />\nGiant on the turntable,<br />\neverything seems immediately<br />\nbetter, and it'shard not to smile.<br />\nRobo McGinty has become a<br />\nbrilliant songwriter who exorcises his pain by singing about<br />\noptimism and joy; the other<br />\nfour Woodentops play with<br />\nassurance at supersonic speeds<br />\nas well as at calmer tempos.<br />\nRob's lyrics are unpretentious affairs, such as in \"Good<br />\nThing,\" which is set to the<br />\nlightest and sweetest of beats\u2014<br />\n\"Thanks for the carpet you<br />\n.sent/I hung it on my wall...\"<br />\nThe sincerity in his voice is what<br />\nallows him to pull off a lyric<br />\nlike that, as well as a song called \"Love Affair With Everyday Livin';\" the Woodentops<br />\nmake everything seem charming, not cloying.<br />\n<br />\nLeading the pack, however,<br />\nare The Woodentops, who have<br />\nThere's a lot to love about<br />\nproven to have quite a knack this album\u2014the heavenly harfor placing singles at the top of monies in \"So Good Today,\"<br />\nthe , U.K. independent-label the shuffling acoustic guitar in<br />\n<br />\n\"Last Time,\" Alice Thompson's refreshingly low-tech<br />\nkeyboards, and Benny Staple's<br />\namazing array of percussion instruments. Without a false note<br />\nor a mediocre song, Giant is the<br />\nyear's best, happiest, shed-theblues album. Even cynics have<br />\nbeen bowled over by this band.<br />\nTry it and see.<br />\nThe Housemartins find cause<br />\nto rejoice from their faith in the<br />\nMan Upstairs. \"Take Jesus\u2014<br />\nTake Marx\u2014Take Hope\" is<br />\nnoted on the inner sleeve of<br />\ntheir debut album, London 0<br />\nHull 4, to be released in the<br />\nU.S. next month on Elektra<br />\nRecords.(A different album title would not be unexpected;<br />\nnot many Yanks would know<br />\nthat Hull is the coastal town in<br />\nEngland which is home to the<br />\nHousemartins.)<br />\nThe Housemartins have<br />\nrecorded several gospel<br />\nnumbers, but only one, \"Lean<br />\nOn Me,\" appears here. Uptempo pop with a social conscience<br />\nis the order of the day;<br />\n\"Sheep\" attacks conformity,<br />\n\"Flag Day\" is about how the<br />\nRoyal Family lives in luxury<br />\nwhile many of their subjects<br />\nsuffer, and \"Sitting On A<br />\nFence\" takes a shot at apathy.<br />\nBut the happy-go-lucky<br />\nsound of these songs comes<br />\nacross more strongly than the<br />\nbrooding lyrics. In most cases,<br />\nthe tunes are tremendously catchy three-minute bits, even<br />\nthough \"Flag Day\" and<br />\n\"Think For A Minute\" prove<br />\nthat the Housemartins can produce beautiful ballads as well.<br />\nP.D. Heaton has an attractive,<br />\nslightly high-pitched voice, and<br />\nhe plays a mean harmonica to<br />\nboot. Capitalist pigs may not be<br />\nstirred by the message, but<br />\nLondon 0 Hull 4 is still a pleasant collection of rousing pop.<br />\n<br />\nGeorge just got out of prison<br />\nafter seven years and he still has<br />\nnot learned that Mortwell, his<br />\nsmall-time crime boss, is bad .<br />\nnews. He asks for a job and is<br />\nhired as a chauffeur for<br />\nSimone, a low-class prostitute<br />\nturned high-class call girl on<br />\nwhom Mortwell wishes to keep<br />\ntabs. With this first job comes<br />\na second: Simone wants George<br />\nto find a young friend of hers<br />\nwhom she left behind on the<br />\nlocal meat rack. She sends<br />\nGeorge on the quest through<br />\nsome of London's more charming tourist attractions Big<br />\nScreen Porno 35MM 50p,<br />\nwhere he encounters violence<br />\nand degradation of a sort he<br />\nhad not known existed.<br />\nThis sordid, depressing little<br />\nFilm is well-written and<br />\nbrilliantly acted, but that does<br />\nnot make it any less sordid or<br />\ndepressing. Someone as emotionally naive as George is<br />\nbound to go through the<br />\nwringer when exposed to soemotionally<br />\nmeone<br />\nas<br />\nsophisticated as Simone, the<br />\n\"Mona Lisa\" in his rearview<br />\nmirror.(How many times does<br />\nNat King Cole have to sing his<br />\nsong before you get the<br />\nmessage?) Sympathy for the<br />\ndistant and haughty Simone<br />\ngrows at first but recedes as she<br />\nis revealed to be not just a victim but a victimizer herself. Only when the whole nasty situation almost literally explodes in<br />\nGeorge's face does he realize<br />\nhow he's been used.<br />\nHad the movie ended there I<br />\nwould have come out feeling as<br />\nclammy and dirty as George<br />\ndid. Fortunately, there was an<br />\n\"upbeat coda,\" which some<br />\nreviewers feels detracts from<br />\nthe movie's tragic power. I<br />\nthink, however, that this coda<br />\nalso gives the film a sharpersense of realism: life does not<br />\nend for everyone at the climax<br />\nof a tragedy. The survivors<br />\nmust carry on with their lives,<br />\nand George has other problems<br />\nhe needs to take care of. For<br />\nGeorge's sake, I'm glad it had<br />\na \"happy\" ending: for all he's<br />\na 'bad lot,\" he tries hard, and<br />\ndeserves a second chance. The<br />\nending offers no promises, but<br />\nit does offer that chance.<br />\n(P.S. If someone could tell<br />\nme the significance of Mortwell's rabbit I'd be much'<br />\nobliged.)<br />\n<br />\n\fNEWS-LETTER/3I<br />\n<br />\nArts Calendar<br />\nART<br />\n<br />\nTHEATRE<br />\n<br />\nThe Baltimore Museum of<br />\nArt is currently exhibiting 102<br />\nworks<br />\nAmerican<br />\nby<br />\nphotographer Minor White.<br />\nThey'll be on display through<br />\nNovember 16.<br />\nAlso at the BMA is a major<br />\nexhibit of the graphic arts of the<br />\nFrench master Henri Matisse.<br />\nAll of the works on display<br />\nwere done on paper, which is<br />\nlight-sensitive, so the museum<br />\nusually keeps them locked up.<br />\nThis is a rare opportunity to see<br />\nsome fine work.

With the<br />\nhelp of assistant coaches Robin<br />\nLandry and Harry Marcopolos,<br />\nshe is trying to iron out as many<br />\nkinks as possible in the team's<br />\nplay before the actual season<br />\nbegins. After the team's disappointing record in their Round<br />\nRobin Tournament, Coach<br />\nAnderson sought improvement<br />\nby revising the line-up, a major<br />\n<br />\naspect of the game. The squad<br />\nswitched from using a 4-3-3 (4<br />\nforwards, 3 midfielders, and 3<br />\nhalfbacks) to a 3-3-3-1 (3 forwards, 3 midfielders, 3<br />\nhalfbacks, and a sweeper). The<br />\n3-3-3-1 set-up appears to be<br />\nmore defense-oriented than the<br />\n4-3-3, but instead the opposite<br />\neffect is created. There is more<br />\nroom in which to work with the<br />\nball and more space for passes.<br />\nAnother improvement is that<br />\nthe forwards have better support from the midfielders and<br />\nhalfbacks. Hopkins is 2-0 using<br />\nthis strategy, beating two different teams (Towson and<br />\nEssex) on different surfaces<br />\n(turf and grass).<br />\nThis year's team has two<br />\ngreat advantages over last year:<br />\nstrength and depth. There are<br />\n11 returning varsity letter winners, a virtual copy of' last<br />\nyear's starting squad.

The<br />\ndepth is provided by the twelve<br />\nfreshmen, seven of which are<br />\ngetting playing time with th,<br />\nvarsity.<br />\nThe varsity is currently carrying 19 players, including three<br />\ngoalkeepers (junior Larcia<br />\nPremo and freshmen Rachel<br />\nMcGuckian and Jennie O'Hara).<br />\nThe rest of the field is comprised of 2 seniors (forward Carol<br />\nButterworth and halfback<br />\nCharlotte Seydel), 4 juniors<br />\n(forwards Savoye and Kacie<br />\nWhite and midfielders Kenoian<br />\nand Heather Klink), 5<br />\nsophomores(forward Patty Ordonez, midfielder Alice Collins,<br />\nhalfbacks Jackie Fatula and<br />\nLaura Perlinn, and trusty<br />\nsweeper Kathy Hart), and 5<br />\nfreshmen (forwards Rowena<br />\nTena and Julie Seigrist and<br />\nhalfbacks Deenie McTear,<br />\nChris Sullivan, and Susan<br />\nSteinwald).<br />\nThe Lady Jays have a busy<br />\nprogram ahead of them, taking<br />\non two or three teams a week.<br />\nTheir home opener is scheduled for next Tuesday against the<br />\nCollege of Notre Dame at 4:00<br />\np.m. at Homewood Field.<br />\nTheir next game, on Thursday<br />\nat 3:00 p.m., is also at<br />\nHomewood, where they will<br />\nface Gettysburg, a tough MAC<br />\nopponent.<br />\n<br />\nafter a three year stint at<br />\nNazareth College, where his<br />\nteams had a combined record<br />\nof 65-17 and two NCAA tournament bids. His teams have<br />\nwon titles (Eastern regional<br />\nchamps in '83-84, 7th ranked in<br />\nthe country last year, I('AC<br />\nchamps when he coached at<br />\nof<br />\nInstitute<br />\nRochester<br />\nTechnology in '82-83) and he<br />\nhas won personal honors(New<br />\nYork State Basketball Coach of<br />\nthe Year, ICAC Coach of the<br />\nYear).<br />\nWhen the season starts here<br />\nin November, the only similarity between Nelson's team and<br />\nthe Blue Jays of recent past will<br />\nbe the uniforms.\"We lost eight<br />\nseniors from last season,\" he<br />\nsays, \"so there'll mostly be<br />\nfreshmen and sophomores in<br />\nthe lineup.\" Nelson's not worried though. \"Nobody ever said<br />\nyou can't be talented if you're<br />\nyoung. Besides, freshmen and<br />\nsophomores tend to listen better. The real key is going to be<br />\nhow long it takes for the team<br />\nchemistry to develop.\" After<br />\nmeeting with some of his<br />\nplayers, Nelson is very impressed with the squad's attitude.<br />\n\"Right or wrong, they're going<br />\nto hustle.\"<br />\nThe new coach is so intent on<br />\nchange that he's totally cleaned out the office he inherited<br />\nfrom Doherty, save for some<br />\nold trophies. \"They're going to<br />\ngo, too,\" he says, \"we don't<br />\nneed any third place awards.\"<br />\nIf Nelson has a tough task at<br />\nhand, Clelan has a nearly impossible chore. Her job is to<br />\nbring respectabiliiy to a<br />\nwomen's basketball team that<br />\nfinished a dismal 2-17 last<br />\nseason. Fortunately she boasts<br />\nquite an impressive resume as<br />\nwell.<br />\n<br />\nGanesh Ramachandran<br />\n<br />\nNew women's basketball and tennis coach Nancy Clelan.<br />\n<br />\nClelan comes to Hopkins via<br />\nMessiah College, where she<br />\nserved as head women's coach<br />\nfor nine years, and Assistant<br />\nAthletic Director for two. In<br />\n1982 and 1983 her teams won<br />\nNCAA Division Ill championships and she was voted Coach<br />\nof the Year by the National<br />\nChristian College Athletics<br />\nAssociation both times. In addition, Clelan led teams to the<br />\nWomen's Christian Intercollegiate Athletics championship in 1978 and 1980.<br />\nAt Hopkins Clelan will have<br />\nthe added responsibility of running the women's tennis program, a new sport for her. \"I'm<br />\nvery pleased to bring someone<br />\nof her caliber to Hopkins,\"<br />\nsays Scott. \"She's going to pro-<br />\n<br />\nvide her teams with leadership<br />\nand direction. Above everything else she's a coach.\"<br />\nClelan is a replacement for Kay<br />\nFowler Dresser, who had to<br />\nleave Homewood when her<br />\nhusband had a job transfer in<br />\nthe spring.<br />\nThe third new face, Garner,,<br />\nisn't a replacement, but rather<br />\nan addition to the staff. He<br />\ncomes from Western Maryland,<br />\nwhere he served part-time as an<br />\nassistant football coach.<br />\n\"Garner had nothing but the<br />\nhighest recommendations from<br />\neveryone we talked to,\" says<br />\nScott, \"and I have no doubt<br />\nthat he's going to be an<br />\noutstanding addition to our<br />\nstaff. He's a real shot in the<br />\narm to our track program.''<br />\n<br />\nLacrosse Ready To Invade Japan<br />\nby Steven Silber<br />\nJapan, known for adopting<br />\nmany of America's national<br />\npastimes, may soon be adopting Hopkins' national pastime:<br />\nlacrosse. Athletic director and<br />\nformer lax coach Bob Scott will<br />\narrive in Tokyo on Monday to<br />\nbegin ten days of clinics at Keio<br />\nand Tokyo Universities.<br />\nThe idea was sprung two<br />\nyears ago from a conversation<br />\nbetween Hopkins Vice President Ross Jones and Japanese<br />\nPrime Minister Yasuhiro<br />\nNakasone, who was here to accept an honorary degree from<br />\nthe University. Jones had lived<br />\nfor several years in Japan during the 1950's.<br />\nLater, 1956 Hopkins grad<br />\nuate Norio Endo would discuss<br />\nthe idea with sportsmen and<br />\nbusinessmen in Japan interested<br />\nin promoting international<br />\nunderstanding through sport.<br />\nThis summer, Mar Edelson,<br />\non a graduate intern program<br />\nwith Hopkins, and Tim<br />\nGoodell, on a similar program<br />\nwith the University of Chicago,<br />\nspent some time at Tokyo and<br />\nKeio Universities teaching the<br />\nfundamental of the game to<br />\nJapanese athletes. \"Marc and<br />\n<br />\nTim laid the groundwork and<br />\nnow I'm going over to build on<br />\nit,\" said Coach Scott.<br />\nVice President Jones will join<br />\nScott in Tokyo on Monday<br />\nafter taking part in the opening<br />\nceremonies of the Hopkins<br />\nNanjing Center for Chinese and<br />\nAmerican Studies, near the east<br />\ncoast of mainland China.<br />\n<br />\nThis will not be the first time<br />\nthat Scott has taught lacrosse to<br />\nnon-Americans. In 1983 he<br />\ntraveled to England to work<br />\nwith 12- and 13-year-olds in<br />\nManchester and London.<br />\n\"We're going to drop the seed<br />\nin Tokyo and let them carry the<br />\nload.

Two of the losses came in<br />\nthe last 10 seconds of the game<br />\ncontroversial<br />\nfollowing<br />\npenalties. Losses to graduation<br />\nsince then have been quite<br />\nheavy though. Gone are nine of<br />\nthe eleven players who started<br />\nthe final game on defense. On<br />\noffense, the Jays graduated the<br />\nall-time leading rusher in<br />\nHopkins history (Brad McLam)<br />\nand the second most prolific<br />\npasser that the school has produced, four-year starter Mark<br />\nCampbell. In addition, the<br />\nteam has lost their productive<br />\ntight end Chris Verica due to<br />\nthe effects of a serious car accident last spring.<br />\nThere's still plenty of punch<br />\nleft, though, as Pfeifer has built<br />\none of the better programs .in<br />\nthe Centennial Conference.<br />\nNine players are battling to<br />\nreplace Campbell at QB. The<br />\nleaders look like senior Mike<br />\nGoudy, a former starter at<br />\n<br />\nwingback who sat out last<br />\nseason, and sophomore Gary<br />\nRupert, the number two man<br />\non the depth chart in '85.<br />\nThey own't have any trouble<br />\nfinding receivers to throw to, as<br />\nthis is Hopkins' strong point.<br />\nTom Finegan, an all-conference<br />\nwide receiver almost ran a deep<br />\npattern all the way to a minor<br />\nleague baseball contract, but<br />\nhe's back on the football field<br />\nat least for this season. Another<br />\nwideout, Tim Rhyme, showed<br />\nflashes of brilliance last season,<br />\nand with a year of experience<br />\nunder his belt he could provide<br />\nHopkins the best tandem in the<br />\narea if Pfeifer can get both in<br />\nthe lineup at the same time. At<br />\nrunning back, Pfeifer brought<br />\nin a herd of promising<br />\nfreshmen last season who have<br />\nonly gotten better since. The<br />\nbest is Chris Chirieleison, who<br />\nsomeday may break all of<br />\nMcLam's records. Defense,<br />\nHopkins' strength in '85 must<br />\nbe rebuilt with new faces. The<br />\nline won't be a problem as<br />\nlongtime starters Tom Kalup<br />\nand Steve Paradakis provide a<br />\nsolid foundation. Everywhere<br />\nelse, though, there's precious<br />\nlittle experience and that could<br />\nspell some trouble.<br />\n<br />\nKevin Thomas Tully<br />\n<br />\nCo-captain Steve raradakis leads his fellow lineman through a pass<br />\nrushing drill. The Jays open their season next Saturday at Swarthmore.<br />\n<br />\nPsenicska (8-0). Campbell was<br />\nnamed to Division Ill's first<br />\nteam All-America. Flamethrower Pete Blohm mowed<br />\ndown his opposition with 70<br />\nK's in only 753<br />\n/<br />\n4 innings. The<br />\nstaff was outstanding with a<br />\n2.56 ERA, but it was fortunate<br />\nit didn't have to toss the rock<br />\nagainst the Jays who had a .324<br />\nbatting average.<br />\nA number of events<br />\nhighlighted the special season<br />\nFor coach Babb and his squad.<br />\nEarly in the season they traveled to Florida where they won<br />\nthe Annual Sanford Memorial<br />\nTournament. The Blue Jays<br />\nalso soared over their Middle<br />\nAtlantic Conference foes until<br />\nGettysburg grounded them in a<br />\ntough 4-3 decision. The Jays<br />\ncould manage only one hit in 14<br />\nat-bats with runners in scoring<br />\n<br />\nposition.<br />\nThe Jays traveled to Havana,<br />\nCuba and played three games<br />\nagainst All-Cuban All-Star<br />\nteams, winning one and losing<br />\ntwo and were royally regaled by<br />\ntheir Cuban hosts. Blohm,<br />\nPsenicska and Campbell went<br />\nthe route in each contest. Scott<br />\nBurns walloped a pitch into the<br />\ncheap seats in left field to appease the fans.<br />\nThe games were played at the<br />\n55,000 seat Stadia de<br />\nLatinoamericano where the<br />\nfans warmly greeted the Jays<br />\ntalents with generous applause.<br />\nPlayers from each squad exchanged small gifts before each<br />\ngame. During the trip, the<br />\nAmerican group had the opportunity to visit a number of<br />\nplaces, including the University of Havana. The Cuban<br />\nMinister of Education hosted a<br />\n<br />\nfarewell party for the Cuban<br />\nand Hopkins players after the<br />\nfinal game. On returning,<br />\ncoach Babb said, \"It was<br />\npossibly the greatest experience<br />\nin my life. I have nothing but<br />\npositive things to say about the<br />\nCuban people we met and the<br />\nhospitality they showed us.\"<br />\nCoach Babb is unfortunate<br />\nthat he will lose six batmen to<br />\ngraduation. Geoff Bender,<br />\nCraig Brooks, Scott Burns,<br />\nMark Campbell, Jim Cardwel<br />\nand Dan Landolphi went out<br />\nwith a big bang to lead Hopkins<br />\nto their super season. Brooks<br />\nbecame the all time hit leader<br />\n(171) at Hopkins, with Burns<br />\n(128) finishing second. \"This<br />\nsenior class produced the best<br />\nfour years in Hopkins history,\"<br />\nsaid Babb. \"It will be tough to<br />\nreplace these guys as players as<br />\nwell as leaders.\"<br />\n<br />\nCarnegie Mellon University \u2022 Case Western Reserve University \u2022 University of Chicago \u2022 Emory University<br />\n<br />\nJohns Hopkins University \u2022 Nev York University \u2022 University of Roch.-ster \u2022 Washington University in St Louis<br />\n<br />\nHopkins To Join New League<br />\nIn an historic agreement,Johns Hopkins University and<br />\nseven other small private<br />\nschools have formed the<br />\nUniversity Athletic Association, a new sports league that<br />\nwill be \"dedicated to the principle that athletic programs<br />\nmust find their proper place<br />\nwithin the overall academic<br />\nmission of each institution.\"<br />\nJoining the Jays in this new<br />\nventure will be Carnegie Mellon<br />\nin Pittsburgh, Emory in Atlanta, Case Western of Clevelend,<br />\nWashington University in St.<br />\nLouis, New York University,<br />\nthe University of Chicago, and<br />\nthe University of Rochester. It<br />\nis believed to be the only league<br />\nin the country bound by<br />\nphilosophy<br />\nrather than<br />\ngeography. Some schools are<br />\nnearly 10(X) miles away from<br />\nother members.<br />\nClearly, the major stumbling<br />\nblock is going to be excessive<br />\ntravel to and from games, thus<br />\n1986-87 will be a \"transition\"<br />\nyear for everyone involved. In<br />\n1987-88 Hopkins will participate in UAA \"Festival\"<br />\ncompetition in cross-country,<br />\nswimming, and fencing. It is<br />\nhoped that eventually there will<br />\nbe regular season competition<br />\nin football, soccer, and basketball and yearly tournaments in<br />\n<br />\neight men's and eight women's<br />\nsports. In addition, the five<br />\nUAA members with baseball<br />\nteams plan to coordinate their<br />\nspring trips and meet down in<br />\nHonda.<br />\nPresently, Hopkins is affil<br />\niated with the Middle Atlantic<br />\nConference in all 23 varsity<br />\nsports except football, which is<br />\nin the Centennial League, and<br />\nlacrosse, which is Hopkins' only Division I sport. According<br />\nto Athletic Director Bob Scott,<br />\nthe new league is not going to<br />\nbe a replacement for this, but<br />\nrather a supplement. In the<br />\nwords of Dean of Administration Robert S. Welch,\"We are<br />\nsimply taking advantage of an<br />\nopportunity to complement our<br />\nexisting athletic schedules and<br />\noffer our students an opportunity to compete with teams<br />\nFrom schools of similar size and<br />\n<br />\nmission in a broader geograph<br />\nical area.\"<br />\nIn the long run, the schools<br />\nhope that the increased visibility that the league provides will<br />\nboost their programs with better athletes and larger fan and<br />\nalumni support. All will try to<br />\naccomplish this without compromising their academic standards. \"The philosophy of the<br />\nUAA is based on the concept<br />\nthat student-athletes are<br />\nstudents first and athletes second,\" says Dr. William Elliot<br />\nof Carnegie Mellon. Therefore,<br />\nUAA members will admit<br />\nathletes under the same standars as everyone else, and<br />\npolicies regarding financial aid,<br />\nacademic progress, and student<br />\nservices will be the same for<br />\nathletes as with students in<br />\ngeneral.<br />\n<br />\nSt.PaulCleaners<br />\n<br />\n3120<br />\n3120 Si.

Al-Shabkhoun<br />\nCutting the number of student advisors by one-third may<br />\nseem an odd way to introduce<br />\n742 freshmen to Hopkins, but<br />\nOrientation '86 \"was really successful\" according to Orientation Chairman Mary Hiatt.<br />\nIndeed, according to Hiatt,<br />\nthe continued success of Orientation '86 depends on the<br />\nunusually small number of student advisors. \"The number of<br />\nadvisors was cut down to get<br />\nthe most dedicated people only,\" said Hiatt. A problem that<br />\nfaces all orientations is that to<br />\n\"continue the momentum<br />\nfound during orientation,\" according to Hiatt. By picking<br />\nonly those students who seemed most dedicated, this year<br />\nHiatt hopes that the orientation<br />\nadvisors will develop stronger<br />\nand more lasting relationships.<br />\n\"You can't say that after four<br />\nor five days students are<br />\noriented,\" remarked Hiatt. \"It<br />\ncan be a two or three year process\" with advisors facing such<br />\nproblems as finding off-campus<br />\nhousing after freshman year.<br />\nHiatt admitted that \"certainly there were some disadvantages with the smaller number<br />\nof advisors. Having each advisor assigned to five advisees<br />\n[instead of the regular three or<br />\nfour] puts a lot of pressure on<br />\npeople.\"<br />\nOther changes also contributed to the success of Orientation '86. Among these was<br />\nthe introduction of team leaders<br />\nwhose work included helping<br />\nthe committee chairmen and<br />\nassisting with public relations.<br />\nA more thorough and interactive advisor training program<br />\nincluding role playing and<br />\ngroup dynamics exercises was<br />\nalso an aspect of orientation<br />\nthat Hiatt hopes will continue.<br />\nThe activities included annual events such as the square<br />\ndance and Motown Night and<br />\nnew activities such as casino<br />\nnight and a dance held at<br />\nCignels. The Cignels night,<br />\nopen to freshmen and advisors<br />\nof Hopkins, Goucher and<br />\nNotre Dame, was so successful<br />\nthat it was \"too crowded\" according to Hiatt. \"I was shocked by the turn-out. I thought<br />\nthat the freshmen would be<br />\ntired-out by Tuesday,\" she<br />\ncontinued.<br />\nSome events such as the new<br />\nwave dance that had been<br />\npopular in the past were replaced with fresher ideas.\"We quit<br />\nhaving the new wave dance<br />\nsince new wave is out,\" commented Hiatt, \"and we had the<br />\nvideo dance instead.\"<br />\nHaving first hand experience<br />\nwith orientation, Hiatt still<br />\nthinks that it can be improved.<br />\n\"One thing that we need more<br />\nof is dorm activities,\" stated<br />\nHiatt,\"we don't need as many<br />\nbig danLes.\" She added that,<br />\n\"Freshmen tend to associate<br />\nwith those few people that<br />\nthey've met and feel comfortable with\" at large dances instead of meeting new people.<br /><br />\nWhat orientation needs is<br />\n\"more smaller activities,<br />\nalthough the planning is much<br />\nmore difficult,\" she admitted.<br />\nHiatt remarked that problems resulting from dealing<br />\nwith Hopkins' largest freshman<br />\nclass were few and minor for<br />\nthe orientation staff. \"It went<br />\npretty well,\" commented Hiatt,<br />\n\"It's just that everything costs<br />\nmore.\"<br />\nFunding for orientation was<br />\nnot limited to one source,<br />\nalthough the Office of Residential Life did lay-out the vast<br />\nmajority of the budget.

Both<br />\ndevelopments were initiated by the<br />\nUniversity administration and both were<br />\noutlined in a curt policy statement which<br />\nappeared in the Gazette last week.<br />\nThe first announcement concerned the<br />\nissue of divestment directly. According<br />\nto the statement issued by the adminstration, the Executive Committee of the<br />\nBoard of Trustees has asked the Investment Committee to reconsider its policy<br />\nof investing in companies that do<br />\nbusiness in South Africa. We applaud<br />\nthat move.<br />\nLast year, we took a strong stand in<br />\nfavor of divestment arguing that a<br />\nuniversity's mission extends beyond<br />\nfinancial well-being. We said at the time<br />\nthat Hopkins should not profit from investments which support the South<br />\nAfrican regime. Instead, we argued,<br />\nHopkins should stand for values\u2014values<br />\nwhich were certainly being violated in<br />\nSouth Africa.<br />\nThis year, following a summer of everincreasing repression on the part of the<br />\nwhite minority government in South<br />\nAfrica, we are even more stalwart in our<br />\nconviction that Hopkins ought to divest.<br />\nThe decision to reconsider Hopkins' investment policy, therefore, seems like a<br />\nstep in the right direction.<br />\nIn some circles, the move has been<br />\ncriticized as little more than an attempt<br />\nto pass the buck to yet another committee. However, the decision to have the<br />\nInvestment Committee reconsider<br />\nHopkins' investments seems to be the appropriate starting place for a change in<br />\ninvestment policy. In dealing with matters of such potential financial consequence to the university, it is prudent to<br />\nmove slowly, carefully, and deliberately. Hopefully, the move to reconsider the<br />\ninvestments will be a prelude to<br />\nthoughtful and considered action leading<br />\nto complete divestment.<br />\nBut while we commend the adminstration for its decision to reconsider the<br />\nuniversity's investments in South Africa,<br /><br />\nwe must take exception to the second<br />\npolicy announced in the Gazette which<br />\nwould effectively ban the construction of<br />\n\"unauthorized structures on University<br />\nproperty\"\u2014an obvious reference to the<br />\nprotest shanties and gulag that were<br />\nerected on the lower quad at the end of<br />\nlast semester.<br />\nIn his commencement address last<br />\nMay, University President Steven Muller<br />\ntold graduating members of the university that shanties and gulags are provocative by nature. And, he argued, such<br />\nprovocation has a proper place in a<br />\nuniversity.<br />\nMuller was absolutely right.<br />\nThe nonviolent expression and exchange of ideas not only \"has a proper<br />\nplace\" in a university, but is essential to<br />\na healthy learning environment. A<br />\nuniversity of all places ought to be a free<br />\nforum for the kind of intellectual exchange which characterized the South<br />\nAfrican divestment debate and<br />\nmotivated the construction of the shanties and the gulag.<br />\nSo, when the Executive Committee announced its decision to ban such<br />\n\"demonstrations of conviction,\" as<br />\nMuller put it, and arrest those who attempt to display their beliefs in the form<br />\nof protest shanties and gulags, the adminstration struck a serious blow to the<br />\nvery mission of the University. The adminstration may very well have the legal<br />\nright to outlaw such structures since the<br />\nUniversity is a private institution, but<br />\nthat right should not be exercised.<br />\nIn all likelihood, the adminstration's<br />\nnewly announced shanty-ban was made<br />\nwith the good intention of preventing the<br />\nkind of violence that occured in May.<br />\nBut banning forms of nonviolent protest<br />\nis not the answer. The University's<br />\nenergies could more profitably be spent<br />\nin attempting to change the attitudes of<br />\nthose who would use force to silence<br />\nothers. Educational programs similar to<br />\nthose proposed by the Coalition are a<br />\nmuch wiser alternative to an outright ban<br />\non protest.<br />\nToday, on the ninth aniversary of the<br />\ndeath of Steven Biko, the slain South<br />\nAfrican Black Consciousness leader, the<br />\nUniversity and the Coalition seem headed for a show-down. Plans are underway<br />\nto erect a shantytown this afternoon, and<br />\nthe university adminstration will have to<br />\ndecide whether or not it will hold fast to<br />\nits new policy.<br />\nIn the end, if the new shanty-ban is enforced, the adminstration may find itself<br />\ncontinuing what the firebombers<br />\nstarted\u2014using force and violence to<br />\nsilence the opinions of others.<br /><br />\nThe lead front page story of<br />\nthe September 2 Gazette contained a statement by University Trustees and the President<br />\nconcerning the University's<br />\nSouth Africa-related investments as well as a prohibition against \"unauthorized<br />\nconstruction\", presumably<br />\nmeaning a shantytown.<br />\nWe have begun to lose faith<br />\nin the decision-making process<br /><br />\nare provocative. Within a<br />\nuniversity, rational provocation<br />\nhas a proper place, and can and<br />\nshould elicit rational response.\"<br />\nThe logic of the statement<br />\nprinted in The Gazette\u2014<br />\nparticularly in arguing that the<br />\n\"unauthorized structures present a danger to safety of persons and property\"\u2014is specious, considering the University Administration's own<br /><br />\ngordon lewis<br />\nof the Board on the divestment<br />\nissue, because at every turn, the<br />\nbuck is passed to another committee. Our several attempts to<br />\ncommunicate with each of the<br />\nseventy-odd Trustees have<br />\nessentially been met with silence<br />\non their part. Since 23 of these<br />\nTrustees (at last count) are<br />\nthemselves employed by companies doing business in South<br />\nAfrica, the Board's unresponsible and inconsistent handling<br />\nof divestment raises conflict of<br />\ninterest concerns.<br />\nWe feel that this issue is of<br />\nsuch importance that the<br />\ndecision-making process be<br />\nopen to public consideration.<br />\nWe therefore request a substantive role in the \"complete reappraisal\" of University divestment policy to be conducted by<br />\nthe Investment Committee.<br />\nWe.are disturbed by the Executive Committee's refusal to<br />\nallow the rebuilding of an<br />\neducational shantytown, and<br />\nby their threat that in building<br />\nshanties, we students, staff and<br />\nfaculty \"will be treated as<br />\ntrespassers.\" This calls into<br />\nquestion the University's commitment to a free and open<br />\ndiscourse, and contradicts<br />\nPresident Muller's Commencement statement of May 30:<br />\n\"Shantytowns and other<br />\ndemonstrations of conviction<br /><br />\nnegligence surrounding the<br />\nMay 24 firebombing attack on<br />\nthe Coalition for a Free South<br />\nAfrica shantytown. The<br />\nUniversity failed, even after the<br />\nMay 7th cinderblock attack, to<br />\ntake the mildest precautionary<br />\nmeasures to prevent further<br />\nviolence.<br />\nWe will not take the Executive Committee's heavyhanded threat seriously, and<br />\nwill renew our efforts this fall<br />\ntowards fulfilling the desires of<br />\nthe majority of oppressed black<br />\nSouth Africans, including the<br />\ntotal divestment of this University's $70 million South Africarelated portfolio.<br /><br />\nOp-Ed Policy<br />\nThe News-Letter welcomes<br />\ncontributions to the op-ed<br />\ncolumn.

Also,<br />\nif you want a cake for your roomate's birthday or something,<br />\nget it here, their bakery is fabulous.<br />\nUncle Lee's: 3317 Greenmount, 366-3333; Uncle Lee's serves<br />\ndelicious Szechuan food.

Home-cooked Italian and seafood is served in a diner<br />\natmosphere. The best part\u2014it's cheap! Most dinners run about<br />\n$5 or less. Only drawback\u2014there's no liquor.<br />\nAlonzo's: Cold Spring Lane, 235-3433; This place is more of<br />\na bar than a restaurant, but not too many Hoppies know about<br />\nit. Alonzo's serves a fantastic hamburger, and rumor has it that<br />\ntheir pizza is just as good.

Yet one of<br />\nthe summer's biggest hits there<br />\nis called \"Happy Hour,\" and<br />\nwhatever irony there is in that<br />\ntitle is obscured by the<br />\nrelentlessly upbeat melody.<br /><br />\nThe Housemartins, creators<br />\nof \"Happy Hour\" and a load<br />\nof other exuberant tunes, are<br />\nrepresentative of a bright trend<br />\nin British music\u2014guitar-pop<br />\nbands who shun the anger and<br />\nanarchy of '70s punk and hardcore, preferring to look back to<br />\nthe days of '60s innocence and<br />\nwhimsy (one band even covered<br />\n\"Itsy Bitsy Teeny Weeny<br />\nYellow Polka Dot Bikini,\" and<br />\neverybody's doing Norman<br />\nGreenbaum's hippie-clippy<br />\n\"Spirit in the Sky\"). In London, there's a flourishing live<br />\nscene, and three or four dollars<br />\nis enough to gain admission to<br />\nsmall clubs like the Timebox,<br />\nwhere there are often several<br />\nbands on the night's bill. Many<br />\nof them are purveyors of this<br />\nPositive Pop sound; Mighty<br />\nMighty, the Close Lobsters,<br />\nWe've Got A Fuzzbox and<br />\nWe're Gonna Use It, the Wedding Present, and the Shop<br />\nAssistants are some of the best.<br /><br />\ncharts. A few of these singles<br />\nwere collected on the \"Well<br />\nWell Well\" album, released last<br />\nspring on the American indie<br />\nUpside. There is real tension<br />\nand a fiery passion in those<br />\nsongs; \"Move Me,\" for instance, builds up to a fever<br />\npitch before exploding into an<br />\ninevitable, song-ending scream,<br />\nand \"Steady Steady\" boils over<br />\nwith the anguish of a man who<br />\nis losing a friend to some<br />\nnameless disease. The Woodentops' first album proper, Giant,<br />\nreleased here on Columbia<br />\nRecords, is a little more<br />\nrestrained. But the old hyperactivity still reigns in some cuts<br />\nlike \"Get It On\" and<br />\n\"Travellin' Man.\"<br />\nGiant is a record to cherish<br />\nfor the way it makes you feel,<br />\na rarity among all the soulless<br />\ntechno in today's Top 40. With<br />\nGiant on the turntable,<br />\neverything seems immediately<br />\nbetter, and it'shard not to smile.<br />\nRobo McGinty has become a<br />\nbrilliant songwriter who exorcises his pain by singing about<br />\noptimism and joy; the other<br />\nfour Woodentops play with<br />\nassurance at supersonic speeds<br />\nas well as at calmer tempos.<br />\nRob's lyrics are unpretentious affairs, such as in \"Good<br />\nThing,\" which is set to the<br />\nlightest and sweetest of beats\u2014<br />\n\"Thanks for the carpet you<br />\n.sent/I hung it on my wall...\"<br />\nThe sincerity in his voice is what<br />\nallows him to pull off a lyric<br />\nlike that, as well as a song called \"Love Affair With Everyday Livin';\" the Woodentops<br />\nmake everything seem charming, not cloying.<br /><br />\nLeading the pack, however,<br />\nare The Woodentops, who have<br />\nThere's a lot to love about<br />\nproven to have quite a knack this album\u2014the heavenly harfor placing singles at the top of monies in \"So Good Today,\"<br />\nthe , U.K. independent-label the shuffling acoustic guitar in<br /><br />\n\"Last Time,\" Alice Thompson's refreshingly low-tech<br />\nkeyboards, and Benny Staple's<br />\namazing array of percussion instruments. Without a false note<br />\nor a mediocre song, Giant is the<br />\nyear's best, happiest, shed-theblues album. Even cynics have<br />\nbeen bowled over by this band.<br />\nTry it and see.<br />\nThe Housemartins find cause<br />\nto rejoice from their faith in the<br />\nMan Upstairs. \"Take Jesus\u2014<br />\nTake Marx\u2014Take Hope\" is<br />\nnoted on the inner sleeve of<br />\ntheir debut album, London 0<br />\nHull 4, to be released in the<br />\nU.S. next month on Elektra<br />\nRecords.(A different album title would not be unexpected;<br />\nnot many Yanks would know<br />\nthat Hull is the coastal town in<br />\nEngland which is home to the<br />\nHousemartins.)<br />\nThe Housemartins have<br />\nrecorded several gospel<br />\nnumbers, but only one, \"Lean<br />\nOn Me,\" appears here. Uptempo pop with a social conscience<br />\nis the order of the day;<br />\n\"Sheep\" attacks conformity,<br />\n\"Flag Day\" is about how the<br />\nRoyal Family lives in luxury<br />\nwhile many of their subjects<br />\nsuffer, and \"Sitting On A<br />\nFence\" takes a shot at apathy.<br />\nBut the happy-go-lucky<br />\nsound of these songs comes<br />\nacross more strongly than the<br />\nbrooding lyrics. In most cases,<br />\nthe tunes are tremendously catchy three-minute bits, even<br />\nthough \"Flag Day\" and<br />\n\"Think For A Minute\" prove<br />\nthat the Housemartins can produce beautiful ballads as well.<br />\nP.D. Heaton has an attractive,<br />\nslightly high-pitched voice, and<br />\nhe plays a mean harmonica to<br />\nboot. Capitalist pigs may not be<br />\nstirred by the message, but<br />\nLondon 0 Hull 4 is still a pleasant collection of rousing pop.<br /><br />\nGeorge just got out of prison<br />\nafter seven years and he still has<br />\nnot learned that Mortwell, his<br />\nsmall-time crime boss, is bad .<br />\nnews. He asks for a job and is<br />\nhired as a chauffeur for<br />\nSimone, a low-class prostitute<br />\nturned high-class call girl on<br />\nwhom Mortwell wishes to keep<br />\ntabs. With this first job comes<br />\na second: Simone wants George<br />\nto find a young friend of hers<br />\nwhom she left behind on the<br />\nlocal meat rack. She sends<br />\nGeorge on the quest through<br />\nsome of London's more charming tourist attractions Big<br />\nScreen Porno 35MM 50p,<br />\nwhere he encounters violence<br />\nand degradation of a sort he<br />\nhad not known existed.<br />\nThis sordid, depressing little<br />\nFilm is well-written and<br />\nbrilliantly acted, but that does<br />\nnot make it any less sordid or<br />\ndepressing. Someone as emotionally naive as George is<br />\nbound to go through the<br />\nwringer when exposed to soemotionally<br />\nmeone<br />\nas<br />\nsophisticated as Simone, the<br />\n\"Mona Lisa\" in his rearview<br />\nmirror.(How many times does<br />\nNat King Cole have to sing his<br />\nsong before you get the<br />\nmessage?) Sympathy for the<br />\ndistant and haughty Simone<br />\ngrows at first but recedes as she<br />\nis revealed to be not just a victim but a victimizer herself. Only when the whole nasty situation almost literally explodes in<br />\nGeorge's face does he realize<br />\nhow he's been used.<br />\nHad the movie ended there I<br />\nwould have come out feeling as<br />\nclammy and dirty as George<br />\ndid. Fortunately, there was an<br />\n\"upbeat coda,\" which some<br />\nreviewers feels detracts from<br />\nthe movie's tragic power. I<br />\nthink, however, that this coda<br />\nalso gives the film a sharpersense of realism: life does not<br />\nend for everyone at the climax<br />\nof a tragedy. The survivors<br />\nmust carry on with their lives,<br />\nand George has other problems<br />\nhe needs to take care of. For<br />\nGeorge's sake, I'm glad it had<br />\na \"happy\" ending: for all he's<br />\na 'bad lot,\" he tries hard, and<br />\ndeserves a second chance. The<br />\nending offers no promises, but<br />\nit does offer that chance.<br />\n(P.S.

With the<br />\nhelp of assistant coaches Robin<br />\nLandry and Harry Marcopolos,<br />\nshe is trying to iron out as many<br />\nkinks as possible in the team's<br />\nplay before the actual season<br />\nbegins. After the team's disappointing record in their Round<br />\nRobin Tournament, Coach<br />\nAnderson sought improvement<br />\nby revising the line-up, a major<br /><br />\naspect of the game. The squad<br />\nswitched from using a 4-3-3 (4<br />\nforwards, 3 midfielders, and 3<br />\nhalfbacks) to a 3-3-3-1 (3 forwards, 3 midfielders, 3<br />\nhalfbacks, and a sweeper). The<br />\n3-3-3-1 set-up appears to be<br />\nmore defense-oriented than the<br />\n4-3-3, but instead the opposite<br />\neffect is created. There is more<br />\nroom in which to work with the<br />\nball and more space for passes.<br />\nAnother improvement is that<br />\nthe forwards have better support from the midfielders and<br />\nhalfbacks. Hopkins is 2-0 using<br />\nthis strategy, beating two different teams (Towson and<br />\nEssex) on different surfaces<br />\n(turf and grass).<br />\nThis year's team has two<br />\ngreat advantages over last year:<br />\nstrength and depth. There are<br />\n11 returning varsity letter winners, a virtual copy of' last<br />\nyear's starting squad. Coach<br />\nAnderson is expecting strong<br />\nleadership from Jennifer<br />\nKenoian and April Savoye, this<br />\nyear's co-captains and last<br />\nyear's co-scoring leaders. The<br />\ndepth is provided by the twelve<br />\nfreshmen, seven of which are<br />\ngetting playing time with th,<br />\nvarsity.<br />\nThe varsity is currently carrying 19 players, including three<br />\ngoalkeepers (junior Larcia<br />\nPremo and freshmen Rachel<br />\nMcGuckian and Jennie O'Hara).<br />\nThe rest of the field is comprised of 2 seniors (forward Carol<br />\nButterworth and halfback<br />\nCharlotte Seydel), 4 juniors<br />\n(forwards Savoye and Kacie<br />\nWhite and midfielders Kenoian<br />\nand Heather Klink), 5<br />\nsophomores(forward Patty Ordonez, midfielder Alice Collins,<br />\nhalfbacks Jackie Fatula and<br />\nLaura Perlinn, and trusty<br />\nsweeper Kathy Hart), and 5<br />\nfreshmen (forwards Rowena<br />\nTena and Julie Seigrist and<br />\nhalfbacks Deenie McTear,<br />\nChris Sullivan, and Susan<br />\nSteinwald).<br />\nThe Lady Jays have a busy<br />\nprogram ahead of them, taking<br />\non two or three teams a week.<br />\nTheir home opener is scheduled for next Tuesday against the<br />\nCollege of Notre Dame at 4:00<br />\np.m. at Homewood Field.<br />\nTheir next game, on Thursday<br />\nat 3:00 p.m., is also at<br />\nHomewood, where they will<br />\nface Gettysburg, a tough MAC<br />\nopponent.<br /><br />\nafter a three year stint at<br />\nNazareth College, where his<br />\nteams had a combined record<br />\nof 65-17 and two NCAA tournament bids. His teams have<br />\nwon titles (Eastern regional<br />\nchamps in '83-84, 7th ranked in<br />\nthe country last year, I('AC<br />\nchamps when he coached at<br />\nof<br />\nInstitute<br />\nRochester<br />\nTechnology in '82-83) and he<br />\nhas won personal honors(New<br />\nYork State Basketball Coach of<br />\nthe Year, ICAC Coach of the<br />\nYear).<br />\nWhen the season starts here<br />\nin November, the only similarity between Nelson's team and<br />\nthe Blue Jays of recent past will<br />\nbe the uniforms.\"We lost eight<br />\nseniors from last season,\" he<br />\nsays, \"so there'll mostly be<br />\nfreshmen and sophomores in<br />\nthe lineup.\" Nelson's not worried though. \"Nobody ever said<br />\nyou can't be talented if you're<br />\nyoung. Besides, freshmen and<br />\nsophomores tend to listen better. The real key is going to be<br />\nhow long it takes for the team<br />\nchemistry to develop.\" After<br />\nmeeting with some of his<br />\nplayers, Nelson is very impressed with the squad's attitude.<br />\n\"Right or wrong, they're going<br />\nto hustle.\"<br />\nThe new coach is so intent on<br />\nchange that he's totally cleaned out the office he inherited<br />\nfrom Doherty, save for some<br />\nold trophies. \"They're going to<br />\ngo, too,\" he says, \"we don't<br />\nneed any third place awards.\"<br />\nIf Nelson has a tough task at<br />\nhand, Clelan has a nearly impossible chore.

He<br />\ncomes from Western Maryland,<br />\nwhere he served part-time as an<br />\nassistant football coach.<br />\n\"Garner had nothing but the<br />\nhighest recommendations from<br />\neveryone we talked to,\" says<br />\nScott, \"and I have no doubt<br />\nthat he's going to be an<br />\noutstanding addition to our<br />\nstaff.

Athletic director and<br />\nformer lax coach Bob Scott will<br />\narrive in Tokyo on Monday to<br />\nbegin ten days of clinics at Keio<br />\nand Tokyo Universities.<br />\nThe idea was sprung two<br />\nyears ago from a conversation<br />\nbetween Hopkins Vice President Ross Jones and Japanese<br />\nPrime Minister Yasuhiro<br />\nNakasone, who was here to accept an honorary degree from<br />\nthe University. Jones had lived<br />\nfor several years in Japan during the 1950's.<br />\nLater, 1956 Hopkins grad<br />\nuate Norio Endo would discuss<br />\nthe idea with sportsmen and<br />\nbusinessmen in Japan interested<br />\nin promoting international<br />\nunderstanding through sport.<br />\nThis summer, Mar Edelson,<br />\non a graduate intern program<br />\nwith Hopkins, and Tim<br />\nGoodell, on a similar program<br />\nwith the University of Chicago,<br />\nspent some time at Tokyo and<br />\nKeio Universities teaching the<br />\nfundamental of the game to<br />\nJapanese athletes. \"Marc and<br /><br />\nTim laid the groundwork and<br />\nnow I'm going over to build on<br />\nit,\" said Coach Scott.<br />\nVice President Jones will join<br />\nScott in Tokyo on Monday<br />\nafter taking part in the opening<br />\nceremonies of the Hopkins<br />\nNanjing Center for Chinese and<br />\nAmerican Studies, near the east<br />\ncoast of mainland China.<br /><br />\nThis will not be the first time<br />\nthat Scott has taught lacrosse to<br />\nnon-Americans. In 1983 he<br />\ntraveled to England to work<br />\nwith 12- and 13-year-olds in<br />\nManchester and London.<br />\n\"We're going to drop the seed<br />\nin Tokyo and let them carry the<br />\nload.

Two of the losses came in<br />\nthe last 10 seconds of the game<br />\ncontroversial<br />\nfollowing<br />\npenalties. Losses to graduation<br />\nsince then have been quite<br />\nheavy though. Gone are nine of<br />\nthe eleven players who started<br />\nthe final game on defense. On<br />\noffense, the Jays graduated the<br />\nall-time leading rusher in<br />\nHopkins history (Brad McLam)<br />\nand the second most prolific<br />\npasser that the school has produced, four-year starter Mark<br />\nCampbell. In addition, the<br />\nteam has lost their productive<br />\ntight end Chris Verica due to<br />\nthe effects of a serious car accident last spring.<br />\nThere's still plenty of punch<br />\nleft, though, as Pfeifer has built<br />\none of the better programs .in<br />\nthe Centennial Conference.<br />\nNine players are battling to<br />\nreplace Campbell at QB. The<br />\nleaders look like senior Mike<br />\nGoudy, a former starter at<br /><br />\nwingback who sat out last<br />\nseason, and sophomore Gary<br />\nRupert, the number two man<br />\non the depth chart in '85.<br />\nThey own't have any trouble<br />\nfinding receivers to throw to, as<br />\nthis is Hopkins' strong point.<br />\nTom Finegan, an all-conference<br />\nwide receiver almost ran a deep<br />\npattern all the way to a minor<br />\nleague baseball contract, but<br />\nhe's back on the football field<br />\nat least for this season. Another<br />\nwideout, Tim Rhyme, showed<br />\nflashes of brilliance last season,<br />\nand with a year of experience<br />\nunder his belt he could provide<br />\nHopkins the best tandem in the<br />\narea if Pfeifer can get both in<br />\nthe lineup at the same time. At<br />\nrunning back, Pfeifer brought<br />\nin a herd of promising<br />\nfreshmen last season who have<br />\nonly gotten better since. The<br />\nbest is Chris Chirieleison, who<br />\nsomeday may break all of<br />\nMcLam's records. Defense,<br />\nHopkins' strength in '85 must<br />\nbe rebuilt with new faces. The<br />\nline won't be a problem as<br />\nlongtime starters Tom Kalup<br />\nand Steve Paradakis provide a<br />\nsolid foundation. Everywhere<br />\nelse, though, there's precious<br />\nlittle experience and that could<br />\nspell some trouble.<br /><br />\nKevin Thomas Tully<br /><br />\nCo-captain Steve raradakis leads his fellow lineman through a pass<br />\nrushing drill. The Jays open their season next Saturday at Swarthmore.<br /><br />\nPsenicska (8-0). Campbell was<br />\nnamed to Division Ill's first<br />\nteam All-America. Flamethrower Pete Blohm mowed<br />\ndown his opposition with 70<br />\nK's in only 753<br />\n/<br />\n4 innings. The<br />\nstaff was outstanding with a<br />\n2.56 ERA, but it was fortunate<br />\nit didn't have to toss the rock<br />\nagainst the Jays who had a .324<br />\nbatting average.<br />\nA number of events<br />\nhighlighted the special season<br />\nFor coach Babb and his squad.<br />\nEarly in the season they traveled to Florida where they won<br />\nthe Annual Sanford Memorial<br />\nTournament. The Blue Jays<br />\nalso soared over their Middle<br />\nAtlantic Conference foes until<br />\nGettysburg grounded them in a<br />\ntough 4-3 decision. The Jays<br />\ncould manage only one hit in 14<br />\nat-bats with runners in scoring<br /><br />\nposition.<br />\nThe Jays traveled to Havana,<br />\nCuba and played three games<br />\nagainst All-Cuban All-Star<br />\nteams, winning one and losing<br />\ntwo and were royally regaled by<br />\ntheir Cuban hosts. Blohm,<br />\nPsenicska and Campbell went<br />\nthe route in each contest. Scott<br />\nBurns walloped a pitch into the<br />\ncheap seats in left field to appease the fans.<br />\nThe games were played at the<br />\n55,000 seat Stadia de<br />\nLatinoamericano where the<br />\nfans warmly greeted the Jays<br />\ntalents with generous applause.<br />\nPlayers from each squad exchanged small gifts before each<br />\ngame. During the trip, the<br />\nAmerican group had the opportunity to visit a number of<br />\nplaces, including the University of Havana. The Cuban<br />\nMinister of Education hosted a<br /><br />\nfarewell party for the Cuban<br />\nand Hopkins players after the<br />\nfinal game. On returning,<br />\ncoach Babb said, \"It was<br />\npossibly the greatest experience<br />\nin my life. I have nothing but<br />\npositive things to say about the<br />\nCuban people we met and the<br />\nhospitality they showed us.\"<br />\nCoach Babb is unfortunate<br />\nthat he will lose six batmen to<br />\ngraduation. Geoff Bender,<br />\nCraig Brooks, Scott Burns,<br />\nMark Campbell, Jim Cardwel<br />\nand Dan Landolphi went out<br />\nwith a big bang to lead Hopkins<br />\nto their super season. Brooks<br />\nbecame the all time hit leader<br />\n(171) at Hopkins, with Burns<br />\n(128) finishing second. \"This<br />\nsenior class produced the best<br />\nfour years in Hopkins history,\"<br />\nsaid Babb. \"It will be tough to<br />\nreplace these guys as players as<br />\nwell as leaders.\"<br /><br />\nCarnegie Mellon University \u2022 Case Western Reserve University \u2022 University of Chicago \u2022 Emory University<br /><br />\nJohns Hopkins University \u2022 Nev York University \u2022 University of Roch.-ster \u2022 Washington University in St Louis<br /><br />\nHopkins To Join New League<br />\nIn an historic agreement,Johns Hopkins University and<br />\nseven other small private<br />\nschools have formed the<br />\nUniversity Athletic Association, a new sports league that<br />\nwill be \"dedicated to the principle that athletic programs<br />\nmust find their proper place<br />\nwithin the overall academic<br />\nmission of each institution.\"<br />\nJoining the Jays in this new<br />\nventure will be Carnegie Mellon<br />\nin Pittsburgh, Emory in Atlanta, Case Western of Clevelend,<br />\nWashington University in St.<br />\nLouis, New York University,<br />\nthe University of Chicago, and<br />\nthe University of Rochester. It<br />\nis believed to be the only league<br />\nin the country bound by<br />\nphilosophy<br />\nrather than<br />\ngeography. Some schools are<br />\nnearly 10(X) miles away from<br />\nother members.<br />\nClearly, the major stumbling<br />\nblock is going to be excessive<br />\ntravel to and from games, thus<br />\n1986-87 will be a \"transition\"<br />\nyear for everyone involved. In<br />\n1987-88 Hopkins will participate in UAA \"Festival\"<br />\ncompetition in cross-country,<br />\nswimming, and fencing. It is<br />\nhoped that eventually there will<br />\nbe regular season competition<br />\nin football, soccer, and basketball and yearly tournaments in<br /><br />\neight men's and eight women's<br />\nsports. In addition, the five<br />\nUAA members with baseball<br />\nteams plan to coordinate their<br />\nspring trips and meet down in<br />\nHonda.<br />\nPresently, Hopkins is affil<br />\niated with the Middle Atlantic<br />\nConference in all 23 varsity<br />\nsports except football, which is<br />\nin the Centennial League, and<br />\nlacrosse, which is Hopkins' only Division I sport. According<br />\nto Athletic Director Bob Scott,<br />\nthe new league is not going to<br />\nbe a replacement for this, but<br />\nrather a supplement. In the<br />\nwords of Dean of Administration Robert S. Welch,\"We are<br />\nsimply taking advantage of an<br />\nopportunity to complement our<br />\nexisting athletic schedules and<br />\noffer our students an opportunity to compete with teams<br />\nFrom schools of similar size and<br /><br />\nmission in a broader geograph<br />\nical area.\"<br />\nIn the long run, the schools<br />\nhope that the increased visibility that the league provides will<br />\nboost their programs with better athletes and larger fan and<br />\nalumni support. All will try to<br />\naccomplish this without compromising their academic standards. \"The philosophy of the<br />\nUAA is based on the concept<br />\nthat student-athletes are<br />\nstudents first and athletes second,\" says Dr. William Elliot<br />\nof Carnegie Mellon. Therefore,<br />\nUAA members will admit<br />\nathletes under the same standars as everyone else, and<br />\npolicies regarding financial aid,<br />\nacademic progress, and student<br />\nservices will be the same for<br />\nathletes as with students in<br />\ngeneral.<br /><br />\nSt.PaulCleaners<br /><br />\n3120<br />\n3120 Si.
