At the convocation<br />\nhe did note, however, that<br />\nwhile it was nice to talk about<br />\nAPL the convocation would<br />\nhave no influence on him.<br />\nMark Derr proposed that if<br />\nAPL were severed, it should<br />\nbecome a public non-profit<br />\ncorporation. He also called<br />\nfor a five man board of<br />\ntrustees for APL. Derr's<br />\nboard would consist of \"one<br />\nman appointed by Hopkins'<br />\nTrustees, two by the<br />\nSecretary of Defense, of<br />\nwhich one would have to be<br />\nnon-military, one chosen by<br />\nAPL's principle staff, and the<br />\nfinal member to be chosen by<br />\nthe other four,\" he said.<br />\nDerr added that it would<br />\nresemble the Rand Corporation as far as it governing<br />\nbody went.

Both Academic Council<br />\nmembers and Dean Benton insist that they wish only<br />\nto look at a professor's merit, but it is likely that they<br />\nwill give in to budgetary pressures. The results of such<br />\nnarrowness can only be disastrous for the vital core of<br />\nthis University, and its academic program.<br />\nThe financial difficulty surrounding the promotions<br />\nissue is but another sad example of the desperate crisis<br />\nat Hopkins. For the first time, the Academic Council<br />\nhas to judge promotions all at once, rather than each<br />\npromotion separately. This is a wise approach to the<br />\nproblem,for it permits a total assessment of the faculty<br />\nsituation, which, hopefully, will allow a more judicious<br />\nexamination of all factors involved in promotions.<br />\nUnfortunately, this is the sort of approach which lends<br />\nitself more to bare monetary concerns than to a genuine<br />\nregard for academic quality. Junior faculty and<br />\nassociate professors who find themselves passed over<br />\nbecause of financial reasons will be quite tempted to<br />\nleave for other schools that can offer them greater<br />\nprestige and a higher salary. Hopkins is already suffering from a shortage of faculty, or to be more exact,<br />\nfaculty willing to teach; more faculty departures,<br />\ncoupled with the present hiring freeze, could do serious<br />\ndamage to the calibre and stature of the Hopkins<br />\nacademic program.<br />\nDean Benton has already admitted that finances are<br />\nindirectly influencing those who are looking at promotions. The influence is, of course, in actuality<br />\nneither<br />\nnor<br />\nindirect<br />\nunimportant.<br />\nBut we urge, for the sake of the University, that<br />\npromotions be on the basis of merit alone. The<br />\nnecessary sacrifices can then come from further cutbacks in the non-academic areas of the University.<br />\n<br />\nBenton Student Union<br />\nThe Student Council's pins for a $210,000 student<br />\nunion were summarily turned down by Dean Benton.<br />\nThe plans called for a comprehensive faciltity to be set<br />\nup in Whitehead Hall to last for ten years. This estimate<br />\nforced the Council to suggest that plans for the union<br />\ninclude a center in Whitehead, rather than any other<br />\nweak substitute that might not fill undergraduate needs.<br />\nBenton claims that the Council's plans are not<br />\nrepresentative. He claims that such a large amount of<br />\nmoney needed for the renovation is not comensurate<br />\nwith the results. He claims that the University would<br />\nnot have the money even with Homewood's share of the<br />\nmoney in state aid. He claims that he was ready to go<br />\nwith a renovation of the basement of Shriver Hall and<br />\nthe establishment of loungess for each building on<br />\ncampus.<br />\nBenton's plans for departmental lounges fit well into a<br />\nscheme for a graduate-oriented University. Undergraduates just don't have any real connection with<br />\ndepartments on this campus. Only graduate students<br />\ndo,and they would be the only ones to use these lounges.<br />\nThe only valid objection to the Whitehead plan is<br />\nmoney. Benton could certainly obtain enough to start<br />\nthe renovation of Whitehead with the $60,000 he<br />\nprepared to spend on Shriver and the money necessary<br />\nto set up the departmental lounges. Maybe the plans<br />\nfor Whitehead are not all that students would want, but<br />\nthey are certain to go a long way beyond the capabilities of both Shriver and departmental lounges.<br />\n<br />\nLetters to<br />\nthe Editors<br />\n<br />\nOpening Grandstand Play Of The Season<br />\n<br />\nMERRY FODGATHER<br />\nTo the Editors:<br />\nThe other day I was reading<br />\nan article in the Hopkins<br />\nNewsletter about you and of<br />\ncourse it brought to my mind<br />\nthe many happy times we had<br />\ntogether back in 1966 and<br />\n1967 In the article you<br />\nmentioned something about<br />\n\"<br />\nif you had a Fairy<br />\nGodmother and if she would<br />\ngive you 50 million dollars<br />\nhow many problems you<br />\ncould solve at Hopkins\".

Carlson, Biophyics, was scheduled to appear at the Forum on it<br />\non April 7,<br />\nbut withdrew when he detected a \"decidedly<br />\nabusive lone\" in the advance publicity. He also<br />\nfelt his position had been misrepresented in a<br />\nrecent News-Letter article. Presented below are<br />\nexcerpts front the remarks he had intended to<br />\npresent at the Forum.<br />\nMy views on the relationship of universities<br />\nwithin our society to classified research<br />\nwere formed during the period of and immediately following the Second World War.<br />\nThe MacMahon bill passed then enabled the<br />\nestablishment of close civilian control over<br />\nour atomic energy program. The vital issue<br />\ntoday is essentially the issue that arose over<br />\nthe control of atomic energy in 1945, namely,<br />\nshould the application of science to the<br />\ndevelopment of military technology be<br />\nconducted solely by the military under<br />\nmilitary secrecy or should it be conducted<br />\nunder the guidance and full knowledge of<br />\nresponsible, authorized civilian groups. I<br />\ntook a stand in favor of civilian control in<br />\n1945 and I have no intentions of abandoning it.<br />\nI do not contend that our civilian agencies<br />\nfor controlling and monitoring military<br />\n\u2022 research have been entirely successful, or as<br />\neffective as we would like. They have been, in<br />\nmy opinion, infinitely better than no civilian<br />\ncontrol at all. Without some civilian involvement, however imperfect it might be,<br />\nmilitary research would vanish under the<br />\ncloak of complete military secrecy.<br />\nSome of you may doubt the capability of<br />\nthe military-industrial complex to carry out<br />\nthe development of military technology in<br />\ntotal secrecy. In 1942, the Manhattan District<br />\nwas established under the Army Corps of<br />\nEngineers for the purposes of manufacturing fissionable materials. This was done<br />\nin complete secrecy. Not even the workers<br />\nwho built the plants knew what they were<br />\ndoing.<br />\nIn the absence of a duly authorized civilian<br />\ncontrol panel, university students, faculty,<br />\nadministrators, and trustees are certainly<br />\nno less obligated than any other member of<br />\nour society for shouldering the responsibility<br />\nof adequately monitoring universty sponsored military research They have, in my<br />\nopinion, the greater obligation to see that<br />\nthis responsibility is discharged.<br />\nHow should civilian involvement in the<br />\n<br />\nmanagement of military research be<br />\norganized? I do not know the entire answer<br />\nto this question but a partial answer can be<br />\nobtained.<br />\nThe Atomic Energy Commission,<br />\nestablished by the MacMahon Act in 1945,<br />\nplaced complete control of the production of<br />\nfissionable materials in the hands of a panel<br />\nof civilian experts appointed by the<br />\nPresident. While not infallible, it is generally<br />\nagreed that the A.E.C. has functioned effectively.<br />\nLaboratories such as the Brookhaven<br />\nNational Laboratory are consortia managed<br />\nby a group of private universities including<br />\nHopkins. This arrangement of civilian (and<br />\nspecifically university) involvement in<br />\nclassified research has apparently been both<br />\nproductive and satisfactory.<br />\nUniversity and civilian involvement in<br />\nnon-atomic classified research has taken the<br />\nform which now exists with A.P.L. That is,<br />\nthe Department of the Navy or Army enters<br />\ninto some kind of contractual arrangement<br />\nwith a particular university.<br />\nObviously arrangements of this type place<br />\nuniversities in an auspicious position to<br />\nserve as civilian monitors of military<br />\nresearch which is under their sponsership.<br />\nThe following question arises: should<br />\nuniversities that enter into such agreements<br />\nserve in the capacity of a civilian monitor? In<br />\n-my opinion, a university's board of trustees<br />\nshould not enter into such an arrangement<br />\nunless they are both qualified and willing to<br />\nserve in this capacity. In the absence of any<br />\npanel such as the A.E.C. I believe the<br />\nobligation to discharge these responsibilities<br />\nrests with the universitities involved.<br />\nUntil yesterday, I had assumed that our<br />\ntrustees and those members of the faculty<br />\nwho serve on the A.P.L. advisory committee<br />\nheld the security clearance required to<br />\npermit them to be fully cognizant of the<br />\nvarious classified projects being conducted<br />\nby the A.P.L. For example, is the laboratory<br />\nfree to refuse a research project on such<br />\ngrounds as: incomensurability with national<br />\ndefense, or extreme hazard to life, property,<br />\nor natural resources?<br />\nIn summary I see the University's<br />\nreationship to the A.P.L. as one in which we<br />\nrepresent our society's conscience in matters of military research. At the same time<br />\nwe can catalyze the conversion of our swords<br />\ninto plow shares.<br />\n<br />\n\fApril 13, 1971<br />\n<br />\nNEWS\u2014LETTER<br />\n<br />\nPAGE 7<br />\n<br />\n*<br />\n'Rusty' Galley: Rising Political Contender<br />\nBy ART LEVINE<br />\nPresident Nixon is in<br />\nserious political trouble, and<br />\nhis advisors say that only by<br />\nsharing the ticket with a<br />\nvice-presidential<br />\nstrong<br />\ncandidate can he be reelected in 1972.

So,<br />\nafter Calley was convicted of<br />\nkilling 22 civilians, the<br />\nAmerican people were<br />\nnaturally angry.

Both Academic Council<br />\nmembers and Dean Benton insist that they wish only<br />\nto look at a professor's merit, but it is likely that they<br />\nwill give in to budgetary pressures. The results of such<br />\nnarrowness can only be disastrous for the vital core of<br />\nthis University, and its academic program.<br />\nThe financial difficulty surrounding the promotions<br />\nissue is but another sad example of the desperate crisis<br />\nat Hopkins. For the first time, the Academic Council<br />\nhas to judge promotions all at once, rather than each<br />\npromotion separately. This is a wise approach to the<br />\nproblem,for it permits a total assessment of the faculty<br />\nsituation, which, hopefully, will allow a more judicious<br />\nexamination of all factors involved in promotions.<br />\nUnfortunately, this is the sort of approach which lends<br />\nitself more to bare monetary concerns than to a genuine<br />\nregard for academic quality. Junior faculty and<br />\nassociate professors who find themselves passed over<br />\nbecause of financial reasons will be quite tempted to<br />\nleave for other schools that can offer them greater<br />\nprestige and a higher salary. Hopkins is already suffering from a shortage of faculty, or to be more exact,<br />\nfaculty willing to teach; more faculty departures,<br />\ncoupled with the present hiring freeze, could do serious<br />\ndamage to the calibre and stature of the Hopkins<br />\nacademic program.<br />\nDean Benton has already admitted that finances are<br />\nindirectly influencing those who are looking at promotions. The influence is, of course, in actuality<br />\nneither<br />\nnor<br />\nindirect<br />\nunimportant.<br />\nBut we urge, for the sake of the University, that<br />\npromotions be on the basis of merit alone. The<br />\nnecessary sacrifices can then come from further cutbacks in the non-academic areas of the University.<br /><br />\nBenton Student Union<br />\nThe Student Council's pins for a $210,000 student<br />\nunion were summarily turned down by Dean Benton.<br />\nThe plans called for a comprehensive faciltity to be set<br />\nup in Whitehead Hall to last for ten years. This estimate<br />\nforced the Council to suggest that plans for the union<br />\ninclude a center in Whitehead, rather than any other<br />\nweak substitute that might not fill undergraduate needs.<br />\nBenton claims that the Council's plans are not<br />\nrepresentative. He claims that such a large amount of<br />\nmoney needed for the renovation is not comensurate<br />\nwith the results. He claims that the University would<br />\nnot have the money even with Homewood's share of the<br />\nmoney in state aid. He claims that he was ready to go<br />\nwith a renovation of the basement of Shriver Hall and<br />\nthe establishment of loungess for each building on<br />\ncampus.<br />\nBenton's plans for departmental lounges fit well into a<br />\nscheme for a graduate-oriented University. Undergraduates just don't have any real connection with<br />\ndepartments on this campus. Only graduate students<br />\ndo,and they would be the only ones to use these lounges.<br />\nThe only valid objection to the Whitehead plan is<br />\nmoney. Benton could certainly obtain enough to start<br />\nthe renovation of Whitehead with the $60,000 he<br />\nprepared to spend on Shriver and the money necessary<br />\nto set up the departmental lounges. Maybe the plans<br />\nfor Whitehead are not all that students would want, but<br />\nthey are certain to go a long way beyond the capabilities of both Shriver and departmental lounges.<br /><br />\nLetters to<br />\nthe Editors<br /><br />\nOpening Grandstand Play Of The Season<br /><br />\nMERRY FODGATHER<br />\nTo the Editors:<br />\nThe other day I was reading<br />\nan article in the Hopkins<br />\nNewsletter about you and of<br />\ncourse it brought to my mind<br />\nthe many happy times we had<br />\ntogether back in 1966 and<br />\n1967 In the article you<br />\nmentioned something about<br />\n\"<br />\nif you had a Fairy<br />\nGodmother and if she would<br />\ngive you 50 million dollars<br />\nhow many problems you<br />\ncould solve at Hopkins\".

I<br />\ntook a stand in favor of civilian control in<br />\n1945 and I have no intentions of abandoning it.<br />\nI do not contend that our civilian agencies<br />\nfor controlling and monitoring military<br />\n\u2022 research have been entirely successful, or as<br />\neffective as we would like. They have been, in<br />\nmy opinion, infinitely better than no civilian<br />\ncontrol at all. Without some civilian involvement, however imperfect it might be,<br />\nmilitary research would vanish under the<br />\ncloak of complete military secrecy.<br />\nSome of you may doubt the capability of<br />\nthe military-industrial complex to carry out<br />\nthe development of military technology in<br />\ntotal secrecy. In 1942, the Manhattan District<br />\nwas established under the Army Corps of<br />\nEngineers for the purposes of manufacturing fissionable materials. This was done<br />\nin complete secrecy. Not even the workers<br />\nwho built the plants knew what they were<br />\ndoing.<br />\nIn the absence of a duly authorized civilian<br />\ncontrol panel, university students, faculty,<br />\nadministrators, and trustees are certainly<br />\nno less obligated than any other member of<br />\nour society for shouldering the responsibility<br />\nof adequately monitoring universty sponsored military research They have, in my<br />\nopinion, the greater obligation to see that<br />\nthis responsibility is discharged.<br />\nHow should civilian involvement in the<br /><br />\nmanagement of military research be<br />\norganized? I do not know the entire answer<br />\nto this question but a partial answer can be<br />\nobtained.<br />\nThe Atomic Energy Commission,<br />\nestablished by the MacMahon Act in 1945,<br />\nplaced complete control of the production of<br />\nfissionable materials in the hands of a panel<br />\nof civilian experts appointed by the<br />\nPresident. While not infallible, it is generally<br />\nagreed that the A.E.C. has functioned effectively.<br />\nLaboratories such as the Brookhaven<br />\nNational Laboratory are consortia managed<br />\nby a group of private universities including<br />\nHopkins. This arrangement of civilian (and<br />\nspecifically university) involvement in<br />\nclassified research has apparently been both<br />\nproductive and satisfactory.<br />\nUniversity and civilian involvement in<br />\nnon-atomic classified research has taken the<br />\nform which now exists with A.P.L. That is,<br />\nthe Department of the Navy or Army enters<br />\ninto some kind of contractual arrangement<br />\nwith a particular university.<br />\nObviously arrangements of this type place<br />\nuniversities in an auspicious position to<br />\nserve as civilian monitors of military<br />\nresearch which is under their sponsership.<br />\nThe following question arises: should<br />\nuniversities that enter into such agreements<br />\nserve in the capacity of a civilian monitor? In<br />\n-my opinion, a university's board of trustees<br />\nshould not enter into such an arrangement<br />\nunless they are both qualified and willing to<br />\nserve in this capacity. In the absence of any<br />\npanel such as the A.E.C. I believe the<br />\nobligation to discharge these responsibilities<br />\nrests with the universitities involved.<br />\nUntil yesterday, I had assumed that our<br />\ntrustees and those members of the faculty<br />\nwho serve on the A.P.L. advisory committee<br />\nheld the security clearance required to<br />\npermit them to be fully cognizant of the<br />\nvarious classified projects being conducted<br />\nby the A.P.L. For example, is the laboratory<br />\nfree to refuse a research project on such<br />\ngrounds as: incomensurability with national<br />\ndefense, or extreme hazard to life, property,<br />\nor natural resources?<br />\nIn summary I see the University's<br />\nreationship to the A.P.L. as one in which we<br />\nrepresent our society's conscience in matters of military research. At the same time<br />\nwe can catalyze the conversion of our swords<br />\ninto plow shares.<br /><br />\nApril 13, 1971<br /><br />\nNEWS\u2014LETTER<br /><br />\nPAGE 7<br /><br />\n*<br />\n'Rusty' Galley: Rising Political Contender<br />\nBy ART LEVINE<br />\nPresident Nixon is in<br />\nserious political trouble, and<br />\nhis advisors say that only by<br />\nsharing the ticket with a<br />\nvice-presidential<br />\nstrong<br />\ncandidate can he be reelected in 1972.

And Calley himself, a<br /><br />\nmere 24 at the time, killed a<br />\nwhopping 102 people with a<br />\ndazzling finesse that has won<br />\nthe admiration of many<br />\ngrizzled combat veterans.<br />\npersonable<br />\nthe<br />\nBut<br />\nlieutenant apparently sought<br />\nno glory for himself, since<br />\nbragging of the exploit was<br />\nkept to a minimum.<br />\nUnfortunately, when word<br />\ngot out, Calley--and the<br />\nAmerican people--received a<br />\nrude slap in the face in the<br />\nform of a court-martial for<br />\npre-meditated murder. So,<br />\nafter Calley was convicted of<br />\nkilling 22 civilians, the<br />\nAmerican people were<br />\nnaturally angry. Calley<br />\nemerged as a combination of<br />\nand<br />\nDreyfus<br />\nCaptain<br />\nSergeant York. As the head<br />\nof the VFW, Herbert<br />\nRainwater, commented,<br />\n'Now for the first time in our<br />\nhistory we have tried a<br />\nsoldier for performing his<br />\nduty.\"<br />\nCalley's political importance was immediately<br />\nrealized as the two most<br />\nlikely Presidential candidates, George Wallace and<br />\nRichard Nixon, began their<br />\nwooing of Calley in hopes of<br />\ngetting him to share their<br />\ntickets. Nixon, of course,<br />\nfreed Calley from the nasty<br />\nstockade, but his attempts to<br />\nget him a luxury suite at the<br />\nwere<br />\nAstoria<br />\nWaldorf<br />\nrejected by the Fort Benning<br />\ncommand as inappropriate.<br />\nNixon also intervened in<br />\nthe judicial procedure,<br />\npromising a final review,<br />\nand is expected to award<br />\nCalley the Congressional<br />\nMedal of Honor in the next<br />\nfew weeks. Wallace visited<br />\nthe affable lieutenant at his<br />\napartment, and offered him<br />\nthe services of his vivacious<br />\nnew wife, Bubbles, if Calley<br />\naccepted the VP slot.<br />\nCalley, with his youth and<br />\ncharm, reminds many<br /><br />\npolitical pundits of the young<br />\nJack Kennedy. Like Kennedy, Calley is a well-known<br />\nbon vivant, with a fondness<br />\nfor good food and drink. The<br /><br />\nA lamed boa vivant<br />\ndebonair, modishly attired<br />\nsoldier also delights visitors<br />\nwith his keen wit and his<br />\nwacky stories about his days<br />\nin Vietnam. When asked by<br />\nthe prosecutor what he did at<br />\nMy Lai, the clever Calley<br />\nequipped,\"We wasted them,<br />\nsir.\"<br />\nRusty, too, has a friendly,<br />\nalmost moronic, manner that<br />\nwill make him a sure<br />\nfavorite with the voting<br />\npublic. With an uncanny<br />\nresemblance to Dumbo the<br />\nElephant, Rusty should also<br />\nbe a big hit with little tots of<br />\nall ages. And the adorable<br />\nsoldier will undoubtedly<br />\nhave lots of sex appeal with<br />\nthe ladies. \"He's so cute and<br />\ncuddly,\"<br />\ngushed<br />\none<br />\nenamored housewife.<br />\nNixon's political analysts<br />\nrealize that Calley has the<br />\nsort of broad-based support<br />\nthat could be a valuable<br />\naddition to the campaign.<br />\nThe highly-prized Youth<br />\nVote, for example, could be<br />\nsnared with the 27-year-old<br />\nsoldier on the ticket. Calley,<br />\nobservers note, wears bellbottoms and has sideburns,<br />\nand he shares much of the<br /><br />\nAquarian Age values of<br />\ntoday's idealistic youth. At a<br />\nNew Year's Eve party,<br />\nRusty proposed a toast to \"a<br />\nlot more love and happiness<br />\nin the world.\" Rusty is also<br />\nstrongly anti-war, which<br />\nshould be a big drawing card<br />\nwith<br />\npeace-minded<br />\nAmericans.<br />\nWhite House staffers are<br />\nnow shaping plans for<br />\nCalley's convention theatrics<br />\nand subsequent whirlwind<br />\ncampaign.
