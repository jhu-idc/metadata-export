This move has made<br />\nand colleges. The professors in colleges and it very difficult for boys and young men of poor<br />\nthe teachers in schools are the direct appoint- families to get on.

The last two are usually united under the name \"secondary.\" All<br />\ndepartmental examinations in the primary department are conducted by the educational department through inspectors and assistant inspectors. In this department there are three<br />\nexaminations, on the basis of which aided<br />\nschools earn grants, namely: infant, third primary and fifth primary.<br />\nThe middle school and matriculation examinations are conducted in various centres by the<br />\nUniversity, which sets the papers, appoints examiners thereof, and, of course, collects examination fees from the examiners. The same<br />\nmethod obtains in the three higher examinations, for F. A., B. A., and M. A.<br />\nFor the primary school, the Educational Department decides both the text-books and the<br />\nstandard of each class, while in the secondary<br />\nand collegiate departments the University is allpowerful, and decides text-books and standard,<br />\nwhile at the same time using the Educational<br />\nDepartment as an advisory colleague.<br />\nDefects and Problems.-1.

The cramming system reigns in all its<br />\nglory, to the exclusion of true education. After<br />\nfighting against the system in India, it is disappointing to find the inroads it has been making in America. It gets first into normal<br />\nschools here, it would seem, and then a little<br />\nlater the ordinary pupil has to suffer.<br />\n<br />\n3. The attempt to give an education in Government schools which should be religiously<br />\ncolorless has not been fruitful of good.

C. Miller the gold<br />\nmedal for the best undergraduate wrestler.<br />\nThe exhibition, on the whole, was interesting, but there are some points which admit of<br />\ngreat improvement, and should be borne in<br />\nmind for future guidance and help. In the<br />\nfirst place, the programme was too long, and,<br />\nas the exercises did not begin until after 8.30<br />\no'clock, things began to get tiresome before the<br />\nexhibition was over.<br />\nThe greatest point which ought to be spoken<br />\nof is the fact that the exhibition did not fulfill<br />\nits purpose. This purpose was to show to the<br />\npublic the best gymnastic talent of the University, while, in reality, the older men who were<br />\nexperienced and proficient in the exercises were<br />\nengaged in lacrosse, baseball or track training,<br />\nand the exhibition was carried on by the comparatively new men. In this sense, the exhibition was not representative of the best talent<br />\nof the University. There is no doubt that had<br />\nthe event been held in January or February,<br />\nas was formerly the custom, when no outdoor<br />\ntraining was in progress, the best athletes that<br />\nHopkins affords could have been had to make<br />\nthe exhibition a far greater success. Old students here say that the events held back in the<br />\nearly '90s were productive of much finer work<br />\nthan was seen last week.<br />\nDR. WARREN'S DEPARTURE.<br />\n<br />\nIt has been generally known for some time<br />\nthat Dr. Minton Warren has been considering<br />\na call to the American School of Classical<br />\nStudies at Rome, but the news of his acceptance of a professorship at Harvard came as a<br />\nsurprise to all but a few of his most intimate<br />\nassociates. Dr. Warren has been connected<br />\nwith the University for nearly twenty years,<br />\nand, during that time, has achieved a reputation throughout Europe and America. He is<br />\na graduate of Tufts College, and received the<br />\ndegree of Ph. D.from the University of Strassburg. Two years ago he held the position of<br />\n<br />\ndirector of the American School at Rome. At<br />\nHopkins he has, through his personal popularity and distinguished scholarship, built up a<br />\ndepartment which is rightly recognized as one<br />\nof the strongest connected with the University.<br />\nHis successor has not yet been announced.<br />\nDr. Warren is the first head of a department<br />\nwho has accepted a call elsewhere since the<br />\nfoundation of the University. In his position<br />\nat Harvard he will be the successor of the late<br />\nProfessor Lane, whose death occurred about<br />\ntwo years ago.<br />\nDr. Franklin of the Baltimore Evening News<br />\nmade Professor Warren's departure the subject of an editorial a few days ago. He once<br />\nmore emphasized the University's pressing<br />\nneed of additional gifts to provide against the<br />\nalways possible loss of others from that group<br />\nof scholars who have given Johns Hopkins the<br />\npre-eminent reputation which it bears.<br />\n,38<br />\n<br />\nThe track team by its showing at Princeton<br />\nevinced the wisdom of those who advised them<br />\nto continue work, money or no money. Had<br />\nthey disbanded earlier in the season, when they<br />\nwere pressed by numerous embarrassments, noticeably lack of financial support, it would have<br />\nbeen said\u2014and rightly\u2014that the team showed<br />\na tendency to \"quit.\" Now that they have<br />\nproved the possibility of remaining in the field,<br />\nthe University hoonrs them the more because<br />\nof their difficulties, past and present.

Finley, a graduate student of Johns<br />\nHopkins University, from October, 1887, to<br />\nFebruary, 1889, and for several years past<br />\n(1893-1899) President of Knox College,<br />\nGalesburg, Illinois, has recently been appointed editor of McClure's Magazine. He is the<br />\nfifth Johns Hopkins man to become prominently identified with leading monthlies, the<br />\nothers being his brother R. J. Finley, Walter<br />\nH. Page, editor of the Atlantic Monthly, and<br />\nformerly of The Forum, Albert Shaw, editor<br />\nof the American Review of Reviews, and<br />\nCharles I). Lanier, of the same magazine.<br />\nRobert J. Finley, the brother of the newly<br />\nappointed editor, was for some years editorially connected with the American Review of<br />\nReviews, and at the time of his death was the<br />\nmanager of an extensive syndicate for supplying leading newspapers of this country with<br />\narticles and information on current subjects.<br />\nThe Finley brothers were both in the Historical Department of the Johns Hopkins University, and at one time were both engaged<br />\nin managing' the so-called \"Newspaper Bureau,\" a kind of department clearing-house<br />\nfor student information on current politics.<br />\nLeading editorials and educational articles used<br />\nto be posted by Shaw and Robert Finley on<br />\nbulletin boards around the walls of the old<br />\nHistorical Seminary, now occupied by the<br />\nIn this way these<br />\nGeological Department.<br />\nskilled editors would make up from time to<br />\ntime a department newspaper. It is possible<br />\nthat this experience had something to do with<br />\nthe development of the remarkable editorial<br />\nqualities shown by these men.<br />\nJohn H. Finley, like his brother Robert,<br />\nwas called away from the Johns Hopkins for<br />\npractical work in New York City. At first<br />\nthe elder brother, John, accepted a position as<br />\nsecretary of the New York State Charities Aid<br />\nAssociation, and soon became editor of The<br />\nCharities Review, a' journal of practical sociology, for which he contributed articles, as well<br />\nas to The Review of Reviews. For two summer vacations he was virtually the editor of<br />\n<br />\n5<br />\n<br />\nthe Chautauqua Assembly Herald. While still<br />\nat the Johns Hopkins University, John H. Finley co-operated with Dr. R. T. Ely in preparing a book on Taxation in American States<br />\nand Cities,\" published by 'F. Y. Crowell & Co.<br />\nBesides possessing editorial gifts, John H. Finley is a good speaker. While still a student at<br />\nKnox College, he won the oratorical prize in<br />\nboth the inter-collegiate contest in Illinois awl<br />\nthe inter-state contest, in 1887, in the Northwest. In June, 1893, he was inauguarated<br />\nPresident of Knox College, where he has rendered useful service in building up the institution. But his talent for journalism and editorial work has now restored him to New York<br />\nCity, where he will doubtless exercise, through<br />\nMcClure's Magazine, a wider educational influence than even the great West afforded.<br />\nThe portraits of the Finley brothers may be<br />\nseen in the Historical Seminary Library. Partial bibliographies of their published work are<br />\npreserved in the department. One of John<br />\nH. Finley's best public addresses was made<br />\nFebruary 22, 1898, before the Union League<br />\nClub of Chicago on \"The Soldier and the Student.\" His winning college oration, given the<br />\nyear of his graduation from Knox College,<br />\n1887, was published in a volume entitled\"Winning Orations of the Inter-State Oratorical<br />\nContests,\" Topeka, 189r. A survival of Finley's influence in Baltimore may still be seen<br />\nin the Newspaper Bureau, in the Southern<br />\nHistory room, where Hopkins debaters now<br />\nprepare for their class contests.<br />\n<br />\nThe preparations which are being made for<br />\nthe coming Medical Convention are, to say the<br />\nleast, alarming. The aspect of the basement<br />\nof McCoy Hall conjures up dire visions of pure<br />\nfood shows and country fairs. Maltine reigns<br />\nsupreme throughout these classic shades, while<br />\nlittle white pills and pink pellets have taken the<br />\nplace of the chocolate cakes and sandwiches<br />\nthat formerly flourished in Cafe Harris. With<br />\nthis removed, the present abundance of \"Perry<br />\nDavis' Pain Killer\" is rendered unnecessary.<br />\n<br />\n\f6<br />\n<br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\n<br />\natbittiGgi.<br />\nThe baseball team has essayed more<br />\nambitious work this season than for some<br />\nyears past. After making a highly creditable<br />\nshowing against the picked sons of Old Nassau, the team faced the heavy hitters of the National League on April 13, in the shape of the<br />\nBaltimore baseball team.<br />\nThis game was intended simply to give practice to the men, and no one expected that the<br />\nBaltimores would do anything but wipe up the<br />\nfield with their opponents. If we could do as<br />\nwell, or nearly as well, as the University of<br />\nMaryland had done on the day before, we<br />\nwould be satisfied. Overwhelming defeat,<br />\neven at the hands of such players as the Orioles, would be no disgrace.<br />\nThe result of this game, while not particularly edifying, was, on the whole, satisfactory.<br />\nThe men did not show that nervousness and<br />\ngenerally rattled condition that was so evident<br />\nin the Princeton game. In one inning, however, the work was very ragged. When a runner was coming home on a steal or an error,<br />\nthe man with the ball did not seem to know<br />\nwhere to throw it, and the whole field was<br />\nthrown into confusion. Strouse committed<br />\nan error here which he should take care to<br />\navoid in the future. When the ball was being<br />\nthrown in \u2022to the catcher, he would invariably<br />\nattempt to head it off, allowing several men<br />\nto bring in runs meanwhile.<br />\nStrouse pitched a good game, but he should<br />\nnot allow himself to be discouraged whenever<br />\nhe is batted heavily. When an inexperienced<br />\nfreshman pitcher faces a League team, he<br />\nshould think himself fortunate in lasting<br />\nthrough the first inning. Strouse's work so<br />\n. far this season has been excellent.<br />\nThe encouraging effect of this game was<br />\nseen in the vim and dash with which the team<br />\ntackled Washington College on the 15th.<br />\nTownsend, the Eastern Shore pitcher, struck<br />\nout eighteen men during the game, but with<br />\nall that, he was hit freely, and 17 runs were<br />\nmade. The Hopkins men showed a great im-<br />\n<br />\nprovement over their previous playing, and<br />\nwith such batting and fielding as they did then,<br />\nthey should have a strong show for the intercollegiate championship.<br />\nThe game with St. John's was simply a batting picnic. We hit their pitcher all over the<br />\nfield at will, Joyner, Clarke, Swaine and<br />\nDownes getting three hits apiece. The fielding was a good object-lesson of the improvement that has been made since the beginning<br />\nof the season. Almost a perfect record was<br />\nmade, some of the chances accepted being<br />\nvery difficult. It is a strange coincidence that<br />\nthe score of this game was also 17 to 6.<br />\nThe baseball team this year is the best that<br />\nwe have had for several seasons, and it should<br />\nreceive better support than it has heretofore.<br />\nIt does not seem that the baseball team is<br />\nbeing justly treated by either the athletic association or the university at large. Because<br />\nprevious teams have been of such a character<br />\nas to shed little glory upon the institution, it is<br />\nnot right, on that account, to condemn baseball entirely. The team was on the point of<br />\n'disbanding early in the season owing to lack<br />\nof support, but they determined to stick it out,<br />\nand hope for the best. If they win the pennant, it will be additional honor to the men<br />\nthat they have persevered and won in the face<br />\nof discouraging- circumstances.<br />\nTHE DIFFERENCE.<br />\n<br />\ndreamed one night I sat amongst great lords.<br />\nAnd bet my gold upon the fickle die;<br />\nAnd one staked all he owned against me\u2014then<br />\nTrembling looked and saw that I had won!\u2014<br />\nAmen.<br />\nI broke a peer 1<br />\nLast night I played with paper kings and<br />\nqueens<br />\nAnd \"drew,\" and \"saw,\" and \"raised\" expectantly 1<br />\nThe while, altho' I longed, the cards came not<br />\nmy way\u2014<br />\nT weary left the table at the dawn !\u2014today<br />\nI, \"broke,\" appear !<br />\nE. P. C.<br />\n<br />\n\fTHE NEWS-LETTER,<br />\nHOPKINS 20, HARVARD 0<br />\n<br />\nFair Harvard, the home of so many champion athletic teams, suffered a very severe<br />\nshock Saturday afternoon, to the tune of an<br />\noverwhelming defeat at the hands of our team,<br />\nby a score of 20 to 0.<br />\nThe large crowd present, attracted by Harvard's fame and by the work of our lacrosse<br />\nmanagement naturally hoped for a victory for<br />\nthe Black and the Blue, but in their most sanguine moments Hopkins rooters dared hope<br />\nfor nc4 such success as was won. Not even<br />\nManila bay, with its score of eleven Spanish<br />\nships to nothing, was as decisive as the recent<br />\nskirmish at Union Park. The game itself<br />\nwould have been dull and uninteresting had it<br />\nnot been for the scientific exhibition of quick,<br />\nclean, low passing, of perfect team play, and<br />\nthe remarkable individual playing of the Hopkins team. The only fault to be noticed was<br />\nthe ragged defense work evinced at intervals.<br />\nThis should be, and can be, speedily corrected. The whole attack played a beautiful<br />\nteam game, besides making several star individual plays, such as those with which Fitzgerald, McInnes, Grimes and Maddren delighted<br />\nthe crowd. Bandel should be complimented<br />\nboth for his excellent playing and for the conspicuous absence of his heretofore chronic laziness. It is a matter of sincere regret that Reyman, owing to an injury received in the game,<br />\nwill be unable to play again this season. He<br />\ndid whatever he had to do well, and gave<br />\npromise of making a good lacrosse player.<br />\nIt is to be hoped that the prophecy of our rooters regarding the forthcoming victory with<br />\n, Lehigh may come true. This, however, can<br />\nonly be done by good and faithful practice, not<br />\nonly of the 'Varsity team, but also of the<br />\nScrubs, for the first team must have something to line up against. In Saturday's game<br />\nthe team lined up as follows:<br />\nGuggenheimer, goal; Griffin, point; Maddren, c. p.; Reyman, 1st d.; Tyler, 2nd d.;<br />\nBruton, 3rd d.; Abercrombie, centre; Fitzgerald, 3rd a.; Bandel, 2nd a.; Grimes, 1st a.; McInnes, o. h.; Sayler, i. h.<br />\n<br />\n7<br />\n<br />\nGoals: McInnes, 7; Fitzgerald, 5; Grimes,<br />\n5; Sayler, 2; Bandel, i.<br />\n.+1<br />\nThe conflict of dates between the baseball<br />\nand lacrosse teams on last Saturday was a<br />\nstriking instance of the inefficiency of the finance committee, which has jurisdiction over<br />\nthe selection of dates. The baseball manager<br />\nscheduled the St. John's game, in the Maryland championship series, for that afternoon,<br />\nat Union Park. Long after his action had<br />\nbeen published, the lacrosse manager booked<br />\nHarvard for Baltimore, and\u2014worse yet--at<br />\nUnion Park, for the same afternoon. Such<br />\nmanagement is not only unjust to the baseball<br />\ninterests, but is, moreover, a slap at the first<br />\nprinciple of the General Athletic Association\u2014<br />\nthe harmonizing of all interests. This offense<br />\nis the more blameworthy because the preceding Saturday, open at home, was not used at<br />\nall by the lacrosse team. If the lacrosse management cannot fill available dates on which<br />\nit ought to be getting good practice, it should<br />\nnot, for that reason, be allowed to financially<br />\nand otherwise injure the other teams. So long<br />\nas the Association recognizes baseball as a<br />\nHopkins sport, the baseball men are entitled<br />\nto just treatment. That they have not received<br />\nsuch treatment, is due to the negligence of the<br />\nAthletic Board in not devising some efficient<br />\nsupervision to prevent the occurrence of such<br />\nmistakes.<br />\n.5/<br />\n<br />\nThe track team went to Princeton last Saturday, to attend that university's annual games,<br />\nand, under existing conditions, did very creditably. When it is remembered that only four<br />\nmen competed, and, moreover, these four had<br />\nonly two weeks' training, every one should be<br />\nsatisfied with their record of two seconds, one<br />\nthird, and one fourth. Knapp, in the iooyards dash, took third place, the race being<br />\nwon in even time. Garrett, in both hammer<br />\nevents, captured second place, and also beat<br />\nhis own record. The quarter was won by the<br />\nlimit men in very fast time, Mullen winning<br />\nfourth place.<br />\n<br />\n\fTHE NEWS\u2014LETTER.<br />\n<br />\nDittbergittp Octuo,<br />\nMr. Clay Miller, whose eye was injured several weeks ago by his opponent's foil entering<br />\nthe fencing mask, has been out and about for<br />\nsome time.

The lectures<br />\nthemselves have been such as to be of real service to teachers. An important feature of the<br />\nwork has been the weekly essays which are<br />\nrequired to be written in answer to questions<br />\ngiven out at every lecture. And perhaps the<br />\ngreatest good of all is the closer relation which<br />\nhas sprung up between the University and the<br />\ncity.<br />\nA<br />\n<br />\nDue probably to the hot weather and the<br />\nspring restlessness, a lusty scheme for advertising the Hopkins-Harvard lacrosse game fermented in Ballard's head.

The<br />\nfees of all aided institutions have, of course,<br />\ncarries an educational work in two ways:<br />\nT. It establishes and supports its own schools been raised in proportion. This move has made<br />\nand colleges. The professors in colleges and it very difficult for boys and young men of poor<br />\nthe teachers in schools are the direct appoint- families to get on.

The last two are usually united under the name \"secondary.\" All<br />\ndepartmental examinations in the primary department are conducted by the educational department through inspectors and assistant inspectors. In this department there are three<br />\nexaminations, on the basis of which aided<br />\nschools earn grants, namely: infant, third primary and fifth primary.<br />\nThe middle school and matriculation examinations are conducted in various centres by the<br />\nUniversity, which sets the papers, appoints examiners thereof, and, of course, collects examination fees from the examiners. The same<br />\nmethod obtains in the three higher examinations, for F. A., B. A., and M. A.<br />\nFor the primary school, the Educational Department decides both the text-books and the<br />\nstandard of each class, while in the secondary<br />\nand collegiate departments the University is allpowerful, and decides text-books and standard,<br />\nwhile at the same time using the Educational<br />\nDepartment as an advisory colleague.<br />\nDefects and Problems.-1.

The cramming system reigns in all its<br />\nglory, to the exclusion of true education. After<br />\nfighting against the system in India, it is disappointing to find the inroads it has been making in America. It gets first into normal<br />\nschools here, it would seem, and then a little<br />\nlater the ordinary pupil has to suffer.<br /><br />\n3. The attempt to give an education in Government schools which should be religiously<br />\ncolorless has not been fruitful of good. The<br />\nDirector of Public Instruction of Bengal called<br />\nattention to this matter last year.

C. Miller the gold<br />\nmedal for the best undergraduate wrestler.<br />\nThe exhibition, on the whole, was interesting, but there are some points which admit of<br />\ngreat improvement, and should be borne in<br />\nmind for future guidance and help. In the<br />\nfirst place, the programme was too long, and,<br />\nas the exercises did not begin until after 8.30<br />\no'clock, things began to get tiresome before the<br />\nexhibition was over.<br />\nThe greatest point which ought to be spoken<br />\nof is the fact that the exhibition did not fulfill<br />\nits purpose. This purpose was to show to the<br />\npublic the best gymnastic talent of the University, while, in reality, the older men who were<br />\nexperienced and proficient in the exercises were<br />\nengaged in lacrosse, baseball or track training,<br />\nand the exhibition was carried on by the comparatively new men. In this sense, the exhibition was not representative of the best talent<br />\nof the University. There is no doubt that had<br />\nthe event been held in January or February,<br />\nas was formerly the custom, when no outdoor<br />\ntraining was in progress, the best athletes that<br />\nHopkins affords could have been had to make<br />\nthe exhibition a far greater success. Old students here say that the events held back in the<br />\nearly '90s were productive of much finer work<br />\nthan was seen last week.<br />\nDR. WARREN'S DEPARTURE.<br /><br />\nIt has been generally known for some time<br />\nthat Dr. Minton Warren has been considering<br />\na call to the American School of Classical<br />\nStudies at Rome, but the news of his acceptance of a professorship at Harvard came as a<br />\nsurprise to all but a few of his most intimate<br />\nassociates. Dr. Warren has been connected<br />\nwith the University for nearly twenty years,<br />\nand, during that time, has achieved a reputation throughout Europe and America. He is<br />\na graduate of Tufts College, and received the<br />\ndegree of Ph. D.from the University of Strassburg. Two years ago he held the position of<br /><br />\ndirector of the American School at Rome. At<br />\nHopkins he has, through his personal popularity and distinguished scholarship, built up a<br />\ndepartment which is rightly recognized as one<br />\nof the strongest connected with the University.<br />\nHis successor has not yet been announced.<br />\nDr. Warren is the first head of a department<br />\nwho has accepted a call elsewhere since the<br />\nfoundation of the University. In his position<br />\nat Harvard he will be the successor of the late<br />\nProfessor Lane, whose death occurred about<br />\ntwo years ago.<br />\nDr. Franklin of the Baltimore Evening News<br />\nmade Professor Warren's departure the subject of an editorial a few days ago. He once<br />\nmore emphasized the University's pressing<br />\nneed of additional gifts to provide against the<br />\nalways possible loss of others from that group<br />\nof scholars who have given Johns Hopkins the<br />\npre-eminent reputation which it bears.<br />\n,38<br /><br />\nThe track team by its showing at Princeton<br />\nevinced the wisdom of those who advised them<br />\nto continue work, money or no money. Had<br />\nthey disbanded earlier in the season, when they<br />\nwere pressed by numerous embarrassments, noticeably lack of financial support, it would have<br />\nbeen said\u2014and rightly\u2014that the team showed<br />\na tendency to \"quit.\" Now that they have<br />\nproved the possibility of remaining in the field,<br />\nthe University hoonrs them the more because<br />\nof their difficulties, past and present. While<br />\nthe team did not sweep all before it, nevertheless it made an eminnently satisfactory showing, especially considering the heavy handicaps.<br />\nTaken all in all, Saturday was a most refreshing day to everybody\u2014except the opponents<br />\nof the Black and Blue.<br /><br />\nSCENE:<br /><br />\nA HOPKINS LABORATORY.<br /><br />\nDoctor\u2014Mr. G., is this substance hard or<br />\nsoft ?<br />\nMr. G.

Finley, a graduate student of Johns<br />\nHopkins University, from October, 1887, to<br />\nFebruary, 1889, and for several years past<br />\n(1893-1899) President of Knox College,<br />\nGalesburg, Illinois, has recently been appointed editor of McClure's Magazine. He is the<br />\nfifth Johns Hopkins man to become prominently identified with leading monthlies, the<br />\nothers being his brother R. J. Finley, Walter<br />\nH. Page, editor of the Atlantic Monthly, and<br />\nformerly of The Forum, Albert Shaw, editor<br />\nof the American Review of Reviews, and<br />\nCharles I). Lanier, of the same magazine.<br />\nRobert J. Finley, the brother of the newly<br />\nappointed editor, was for some years editorially connected with the American Review of<br />\nReviews, and at the time of his death was the<br />\nmanager of an extensive syndicate for supplying leading newspapers of this country with<br />\narticles and information on current subjects.<br />\nThe Finley brothers were both in the Historical Department of the Johns Hopkins University, and at one time were both engaged<br />\nin managing' the so-called \"Newspaper Bureau,\" a kind of department clearing-house<br />\nfor student information on current politics.<br />\nLeading editorials and educational articles used<br />\nto be posted by Shaw and Robert Finley on<br />\nbulletin boards around the walls of the old<br />\nHistorical Seminary, now occupied by the<br />\nIn this way these<br />\nGeological Department.<br />\nskilled editors would make up from time to<br />\ntime a department newspaper. It is possible<br />\nthat this experience had something to do with<br />\nthe development of the remarkable editorial<br />\nqualities shown by these men.<br />\nJohn H. Finley, like his brother Robert,<br />\nwas called away from the Johns Hopkins for<br />\npractical work in New York City. At first<br />\nthe elder brother, John, accepted a position as<br />\nsecretary of the New York State Charities Aid<br />\nAssociation, and soon became editor of The<br />\nCharities Review, a' journal of practical sociology, for which he contributed articles, as well<br />\nas to The Review of Reviews. For two summer vacations he was virtually the editor of<br /><br />\n5<br /><br />\nthe Chautauqua Assembly Herald. While still<br />\nat the Johns Hopkins University, John H. Finley co-operated with Dr. R. T. Ely in preparing a book on Taxation in American States<br />\nand Cities,\" published by 'F. Y. Crowell &amp; Co.<br />\nBesides possessing editorial gifts, John H. Finley is a good speaker. While still a student at<br />\nKnox College, he won the oratorical prize in<br />\nboth the inter-collegiate contest in Illinois awl<br />\nthe inter-state contest, in 1887, in the Northwest. In June, 1893, he was inauguarated<br />\nPresident of Knox College, where he has rendered useful service in building up the institution. But his talent for journalism and editorial work has now restored him to New York<br />\nCity, where he will doubtless exercise, through<br />\nMcClure's Magazine, a wider educational influence than even the great West afforded.<br />\nThe portraits of the Finley brothers may be<br />\nseen in the Historical Seminary Library. Partial bibliographies of their published work are<br />\npreserved in the department. One of John<br />\nH. Finley's best public addresses was made<br />\nFebruary 22, 1898, before the Union League<br />\nClub of Chicago on \"The Soldier and the Student.\" His winning college oration, given the<br />\nyear of his graduation from Knox College,<br />\n1887, was published in a volume entitled\"Winning Orations of the Inter-State Oratorical<br />\nContests,\" Topeka, 189r. A survival of Finley's influence in Baltimore may still be seen<br />\nin the Newspaper Bureau, in the Southern<br />\nHistory room, where Hopkins debaters now<br />\nprepare for their class contests.<br /><br />\nThe preparations which are being made for<br />\nthe coming Medical Convention are, to say the<br />\nleast, alarming. The aspect of the basement<br />\nof McCoy Hall conjures up dire visions of pure<br />\nfood shows and country fairs. Maltine reigns<br />\nsupreme throughout these classic shades, while<br />\nlittle white pills and pink pellets have taken the<br />\nplace of the chocolate cakes and sandwiches<br />\nthat formerly flourished in Cafe Harris. With<br />\nthis removed, the present abundance of \"Perry<br />\nDavis' Pain Killer\" is rendered unnecessary.<br /><br />\n6<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br /><br />\natbittiGgi.<br />\nThe baseball team has essayed more<br />\nambitious work this season than for some<br />\nyears past. After making a highly creditable<br />\nshowing against the picked sons of Old Nassau, the team faced the heavy hitters of the National League on April 13, in the shape of the<br />\nBaltimore baseball team.<br />\nThis game was intended simply to give practice to the men, and no one expected that the<br />\nBaltimores would do anything but wipe up the<br />\nfield with their opponents. If we could do as<br />\nwell, or nearly as well, as the University of<br />\nMaryland had done on the day before, we<br />\nwould be satisfied. Overwhelming defeat,<br />\neven at the hands of such players as the Orioles, would be no disgrace.<br />\nThe result of this game, while not particularly edifying, was, on the whole, satisfactory.<br />\nThe men did not show that nervousness and<br />\ngenerally rattled condition that was so evident<br />\nin the Princeton game. In one inning, however, the work was very ragged. When a runner was coming home on a steal or an error,<br />\nthe man with the ball did not seem to know<br />\nwhere to throw it, and the whole field was<br />\nthrown into confusion. Strouse committed<br />\nan error here which he should take care to<br />\navoid in the future. When the ball was being<br />\nthrown in \u2022to the catcher, he would invariably<br />\nattempt to head it off, allowing several men<br />\nto bring in runs meanwhile.<br />\nStrouse pitched a good game, but he should<br />\nnot allow himself to be discouraged whenever<br />\nhe is batted heavily. When an inexperienced<br />\nfreshman pitcher faces a League team, he<br />\nshould think himself fortunate in lasting<br />\nthrough the first inning. Strouse's work so<br />\n. far this season has been excellent.<br />\nThe encouraging effect of this game was<br />\nseen in the vim and dash with which the team<br />\ntackled Washington College on the 15th.<br />\nTownsend, the Eastern Shore pitcher, struck<br />\nout eighteen men during the game, but with<br />\nall that, he was hit freely, and 17 runs were<br />\nmade. The Hopkins men showed a great im-<br /><br />\nprovement over their previous playing, and<br />\nwith such batting and fielding as they did then,<br />\nthey should have a strong show for the intercollegiate championship.<br />\nThe game with St. John's was simply a batting picnic. We hit their pitcher all over the<br />\nfield at will, Joyner, Clarke, Swaine and<br />\nDownes getting three hits apiece. The fielding was a good object-lesson of the improvement that has been made since the beginning<br />\nof the season. Almost a perfect record was<br />\nmade, some of the chances accepted being<br />\nvery difficult. It is a strange coincidence that<br />\nthe score of this game was also 17 to 6.<br />\nThe baseball team this year is the best that<br />\nwe have had for several seasons, and it should<br />\nreceive better support than it has heretofore.<br />\nIt does not seem that the baseball team is<br />\nbeing justly treated by either the athletic association or the university at large. Because<br />\nprevious teams have been of such a character<br />\nas to shed little glory upon the institution, it is<br />\nnot right, on that account, to condemn baseball entirely. The team was on the point of<br />\n'disbanding early in the season owing to lack<br />\nof support, but they determined to stick it out,<br />\nand hope for the best. If they win the pennant, it will be additional honor to the men<br />\nthat they have persevered and won in the face<br />\nof discouraging- circumstances.<br />\nTHE DIFFERENCE.<br /><br />\ndreamed one night I sat amongst great lords.<br />\nAnd bet my gold upon the fickle die;<br />\nAnd one staked all he owned against me\u2014then<br />\nTrembling looked and saw that I had won!\u2014<br />\nAmen.<br />\nI broke a peer 1<br />\nLast night I played with paper kings and<br />\nqueens<br />\nAnd \"drew,\" and \"saw,\" and \"raised\" expectantly 1<br />\nThe while, altho' I longed, the cards came not<br />\nmy way\u2014<br />\nT weary left the table at the dawn !\u2014today<br />\nI, \"broke,\" appear !<br />\nE. P. C.<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER,<br />\nHOPKINS 20, HARVARD 0<br /><br />\nFair Harvard, the home of so many champion athletic teams, suffered a very severe<br />\nshock Saturday afternoon, to the tune of an<br />\noverwhelming defeat at the hands of our team,<br />\nby a score of 20 to 0.<br />\nThe large crowd present, attracted by Harvard's fame and by the work of our lacrosse<br />\nmanagement naturally hoped for a victory for<br />\nthe Black and the Blue, but in their most sanguine moments Hopkins rooters dared hope<br />\nfor nc4 such success as was won. Not even<br />\nManila bay, with its score of eleven Spanish<br />\nships to nothing, was as decisive as the recent<br />\nskirmish at Union Park. The game itself<br />\nwould have been dull and uninteresting had it<br />\nnot been for the scientific exhibition of quick,<br />\nclean, low passing, of perfect team play, and<br />\nthe remarkable individual playing of the Hopkins team. The only fault to be noticed was<br />\nthe ragged defense work evinced at intervals.<br />\nThis should be, and can be, speedily corrected. The whole attack played a beautiful<br />\nteam game, besides making several star individual plays, such as those with which Fitzgerald, McInnes, Grimes and Maddren delighted<br />\nthe crowd. Bandel should be complimented<br />\nboth for his excellent playing and for the conspicuous absence of his heretofore chronic laziness. It is a matter of sincere regret that Reyman, owing to an injury received in the game,<br />\nwill be unable to play again this season. He<br />\ndid whatever he had to do well, and gave<br />\npromise of making a good lacrosse player.<br />\nIt is to be hoped that the prophecy of our rooters regarding the forthcoming victory with<br />\n, Lehigh may come true. This, however, can<br />\nonly be done by good and faithful practice, not<br />\nonly of the 'Varsity team, but also of the<br />\nScrubs, for the first team must have something to line up against. In Saturday's game<br />\nthe team lined up as follows:<br />\nGuggenheimer, goal; Griffin, point; Maddren, c. p.; Reyman, 1st d.; Tyler, 2nd d.;<br />\nBruton, 3rd d.; Abercrombie, centre; Fitzgerald, 3rd a.; Bandel, 2nd a.; Grimes, 1st a.; McInnes, o. h.; Sayler, i. h.<br /><br />\n7<br /><br />\nGoals: McInnes, 7; Fitzgerald, 5; Grimes,<br />\n5; Sayler, 2; Bandel, i.<br />\n.+1<br />\nThe conflict of dates between the baseball<br />\nand lacrosse teams on last Saturday was a<br />\nstriking instance of the inefficiency of the finance committee, which has jurisdiction over<br />\nthe selection of dates. The baseball manager<br />\nscheduled the St. John's game, in the Maryland championship series, for that afternoon,<br />\nat Union Park. Long after his action had<br />\nbeen published, the lacrosse manager booked<br />\nHarvard for Baltimore, and\u2014worse yet--at<br />\nUnion Park, for the same afternoon. Such<br />\nmanagement is not only unjust to the baseball<br />\ninterests, but is, moreover, a slap at the first<br />\nprinciple of the General Athletic Association\u2014<br />\nthe harmonizing of all interests. This offense<br />\nis the more blameworthy because the preceding Saturday, open at home, was not used at<br />\nall by the lacrosse team. If the lacrosse management cannot fill available dates on which<br />\nit ought to be getting good practice, it should<br />\nnot, for that reason, be allowed to financially<br />\nand otherwise injure the other teams. So long<br />\nas the Association recognizes baseball as a<br />\nHopkins sport, the baseball men are entitled<br />\nto just treatment. That they have not received<br />\nsuch treatment, is due to the negligence of the<br />\nAthletic Board in not devising some efficient<br />\nsupervision to prevent the occurrence of such<br />\nmistakes.<br />\n.5/<br /><br />\nThe track team went to Princeton last Saturday, to attend that university's annual games,<br />\nand, under existing conditions, did very creditably. When it is remembered that only four<br />\nmen competed, and, moreover, these four had<br />\nonly two weeks' training, every one should be<br />\nsatisfied with their record of two seconds, one<br />\nthird, and one fourth. Knapp, in the iooyards dash, took third place, the race being<br />\nwon in even time. Garrett, in both hammer<br />\nevents, captured second place, and also beat<br />\nhis own record. The quarter was won by the<br />\nlimit men in very fast time, Mullen winning<br />\nfourth place.<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS\u2014LETTER.<br /><br />\nDittbergittp Octuo,<br />\nMr. Clay Miller, whose eye was injured several weeks ago by his opponent's foil entering<br />\nthe fencing mask, has been out and about for<br />\nsome time.

Besides these, there are<br />\n191 attendants on the historical lectures and<br />\n115 on the scientific lectures. The lectures<br />\nthemselves have been such as to be of real service to teachers. An important feature of the<br />\nwork has been the weekly essays which are<br />\nrequired to be written in answer to questions<br />\ngiven out at every lecture. And perhaps the<br />\ngreatest good of all is the closer relation which<br />\nhas sprung up between the University and the<br />\ncity.<br />\nA<br /><br />\nDue probably to the hot weather and the<br />\nspring restlessness, a lusty scheme for advertising the Hopkins-Harvard lacrosse game fermented in Ballard's head.
