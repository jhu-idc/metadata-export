Asta<br />\nOn Thursday, February<br />\n27th, twenty-five Hopkins<br />\nstudents will attend a lobby in<br />\nWashington, D.C., run by the<br />\nStudent Coalition for Soviet<br />\nJewry in association with the<br />\nStudent Struggle for Soviet<br />\nJewry and the National Conference for Soviet Jewry. The<br />\npurpose of the lobby, says<br />\nHopkins organizer Bennett<br />\nDegen, is \"to put pressure on<br />\nthe United States to put<br />\npressure on the Soviet Union<br />\nfor fundamental human rights<br />\nfor Soviet Jews.\"<br />\nThe Hopkins group, in<br />\nassociation with the Hopkins<br />\nJewish Student Association,<br />\nwill attend workshops, listen to<br />\nspeeches from members of<br />\nCongress, and lobby their<br />\nrespective congressmen on the<br />\nbehalf of Soviet Jews, according to Degen.<br />\nthe<br />\nestimates<br />\nDegen<br />\nWashington turnout to be \"a<br />\ncouple of thousand\" in<br />\nrecognition of International<br />\nStudent Solidarity Day. The<br />\nlobby includes such Congress<br />\nmembers as Sen. Paul Simon,<br />\nSen. John C. Dansforth, Rep.<br />\nSteve Bartlett, and Rep. Robert<br />\nGarcia. The wife of Anatoly<br />\nScharansky was originally on<br />\nthe executive council of the lobby board; however, Degen<br />\ndoubts she will be present in<br />\nlight of Scharansky's recent<br />\n<br />\nleader of the Refusnik Movement,\" a group of Jews in the<br />\nSoviet Union whose requests to<br />\nobtain exit visas are denied. An<br />\nadded dimension to the rally,<br />\nsays Degen, is \"to show the<br />\nKremlin that, although we are<br />\nhappy about Scharansky's<br />\nrelease, we will not be satisfied<br />\nuntil all are allowed to immigrate to Israel.\"<br />\nThe goals of the Student<br />\nCoalition for Soviet Jewry are<br />\nto guarantee to Soviet Jews<br />\n\"the right to their own culture,<br />\nthe right to practice their<br />\nreligion, and the right to live in<br />\nthe land of their choice,\" according to Degen.<br />\nFounded at Brandeis University in the 70's, the Student<br />\nCoalition for Soviet Jewry accuses the Soviet Union of<br />\ndisregarding the Helsinki Accords of 1975. They see the<br />\n<br />\nrights of Soviet Jews violated in<br />\nboth human rights and fundamental freedoms, said<br />\nDegen.<br />\nSome points made by the<br />\ncoalition are that it is illegal to<br />\nteach Hebrew in the Soviet<br />\nUnion, that the government<br />\ndoes not recognize the State of<br />\nIsrael and its right to exist, that<br />\nJews adhering to their faith are<br />\nsent to Siberian concentration<br />\ncamps, and that Refusniks lose<br />\ntheir jobs, suffer harrassment,<br />\nand become second class<br />\ncitizens.<br />\nDegen has been active in the<br />\nStudent Struggle for Soviet<br />\nJewry and the Greater New<br />\nYork Conference of Soviet<br />\nJewry for 8 years.

Well over half of those<br />\nvoting-56 percent\u2014favored divestment. In all, 409 people voted for divestment, 73 more than voted for Paul Kadri<br />\nlast year.<br />\nThe referendum was called, Council<br />\nmembers said two weeks ago, to gauge<br />\nstudent feeling on the issue of South<br />\nAfrican investments. Although it was<br />\nnever stated openly, the clear implication<br />\n<br />\nwas that if students endorsed divestment,<br />\nthe Council would too. That was a<br />\nthoroughly reasonable position, since the<br />\nCouncil was not elected to deliberate on<br />\npolitical issues, and generally should<br />\navoid such matters.<br />\nAnd yet, despite the endorsement of<br />\ndivestment by the student body, the<br />\nCouncil refused to sign the so-called<br />\n\"Points of Unity\" the Hopkins Coalition for a Free South Africa has been<br />\npushing.<br />\nWhy? Well, there are probably several<br />\nreasons. First, University Treasurer<br />\nRiggs Griffith must have convinced<br />\nseveral Council members that divestment<br />\nis a bad idea. Second, some members<br />\nbelieve that since people who favor<br />\ndivestment were more likely to vote than<br />\nthose who oppose it, the results were<br />\nessentially meaningless. And last, there<br />\nwere no doubt some members who were<br />\nsimply intransigent, and who were going<br />\nto ignore the vote totals no matter what.<br />\nIn any event, it is a pity the Council<br />\ndid not endorse divestment. Having quite<br />\nrightly declared the matter beyond its<br />\ncompetence, the Council had referred the<br />\nissue to the voters. It should have listened to what they said.<br />\n<br />\nCommemoration Day<br />\nWhen the faculty and the Trustees and<br />\nthose ever-present \"distinguished<br />\nguests\" all get together later today to<br />\ncommemorate the 110th anniversary of<br />\nthe University, everybody will no doubt<br />\nbe cheerful and happy and optimistic and<br />\nsay wonderful things about this great institution that stands at the forefront of<br />\nAmerican higher education and is a<br />\nleader in research efforts and was the<br />\nfirst true university in America and is a<br />\nmonument to the legacy of Johns<br />\nHopkins and fields a great lacrosse team<br />\nand has a really neat clock tower<br />\nand<br />\nWell, we have a word of caution: This<br />\nis not the time to be patting ourselves on<br />\nthe back, it is the time to be kicking<br />\nourselves in the rear. Hopkins may well<br />\nbe a highly-respected pillar of academe,<br />\nbut it is also a university in dire need of<br />\na thorough re-evaluation.<br />\nTo go step-by-step: the faculty is narrow and myopic in its devotion to<br />\nacademic research and is widely perceived as caring little (if at all) about<br />\nundergraduates; the students are a selfish<br />\nlot who cannot seem to conceive of<br />\nanything more important than getting into medical school; and the administration is just generally incompetent.<br />\nAs an example, take the faculty's<br />\ntraditional hostility to Spring Fair. The<br />\nfaculty has always hated the Fair, principally because its precious academic<br />\nresearch cannot be interrupted for all<br />\nof\u2014one day! That's really why the Fair<br />\nno longer has music on Friday.<br />\nThe students are not much better. The<br />\nbiggest student protest in our memory<br />\n<br />\noccurred not because of South African<br />\ninvestment or alcohol policy or tuition<br />\nincreases, but because of a proposal to<br />\nclose the Hut. In other words, what<br />\nscares Hopkins students most is the idea<br />\nthat they won't be able to study at 4 a.m.<br />\nIndeed, we are known nationwide as one<br />\nof the most boring, overly-professional<br />\nstudent bodies in the country.<br />\nAnd as for the administration? Well,<br />\nwhere should we begin? Just this year<br />\nalone, it has come to light that the<br />\npowers that be were duped into signing<br />\na ridiculous food service contract, made<br />\ninnumerable goofs in organizing the dormitory telephone service, offended the<br />\nneighbors and generally contiliued to<br />\nfoul up the situation at WJHU.<br />\nBut having sounded sufficiently<br />\nlugubrious, let us add that the situation<br />\nisn't hopeless. An effort can be made to<br />\nincrease the stress placed on teaching<br />\n(from nil to slight, at least) when awarding tenure. Similarly, we can try to<br />\nrecruit high school seniors with strong<br />\nrecords in extracurricular activities, and<br />\nwith interests in fields other than the<br />\nsciences. And perhaps even the administration can admit its checkered<br />\npast, and resolve to stay on its toes in the<br />\nfuture.<br />\nOur point is that resting on our<br />\nprestigious name won't do anyone any<br />\ngood. Instead, we must all candidly<br />\nassess the University's(many) problems,<br />\nand seek ways to solve them.<br />\nAs Hopkins enters its twelfth decade,<br />\nit would do well to make today less an<br />\noccasion for celebration, and more an<br />\nopportunity for recommitment.<br />\n<br />\nTheater at Hopkins is a<br />\nvaluable thing. It is one of the<br />\nfew glowing jewels in a vast<br />\ndesert of sand. Glowing, but<br />\nnot sparkling. Like most jewels,<br />\nHopkins theater needs a good<br />\npolishing in order to reveal its<br />\ntrue beauty.<br />\nWhy the metaphors? Mostly<br />\nto soften the distasteful lack of<br />\nattention that the administra-<br />\n<br />\nbe rented at a cost of several<br />\nhundred dollars, or they must<br />\nbe borrowed from the Writing<br />\nSeminars department at great<br />\ninconvenience.<br />\nAnother area that needs<br />\nwork is the sound system, or<br />\nlack therof. Currently, there is<br />\nno sound system that can be<br />\noperated from the control<br />\nbooth.<br />\n<br />\nmike kupritz<br />\ntion, specfically the SAC has<br />\npaid to the needs of people interested in theater at Hopkins.<br />\nI'm not talking about the quality of instruction, which is firstrate. I'm talking about the fact<br />\nthat existing equipment provided<br />\nby the university to performance groups on this campus is<br />\nbarely adequate for even the<br />\nleast ambitous of productions.<br />\nAside from Shriver Hall<br />\nauditorium, which is prohibitively expensive for small productions to use, there is one<br />\n\"major\" theater faacility at<br />\nHomewood: the L-V room.<br />\nThere is also the Little Theater,<br />\nwhich is considerably smaller.<br />\nThe L-V room is used by<br />\nvarious groups. These include<br />\nthe Barnstormers (the major<br />\ntheater group on campus), the<br />\nWriting Seminars department<br />\n(Arellano's productions), and<br />\nof course, Edward Albee's intersession courses.<br />\nThere are a lot of technical<br />\nproblems with the L-V room,<br />\naccording to Edward Albee and<br />\ninformed sources in the Writing<br />\nSeminars department.

But our quarrel is less<br />\nwith the article's placement<br />\nthan with its content. Why was<br />\na freshman, whose ignorance of<br />\nproper journalistic practice was<br />\nmanifest, assigned so consequential a story? Jon Stempel,<br />\nthe reporter in question spoke<br />\nto not a single Goucher student<br />\nor faculty member.

In fraternity yearbook<br />\npictures and the Rush handbook, they omitted all mentions<br />\nof alcohol, regardless if it was<br />\nabout people over 21, or in<br />\nother regards legal.

I took Wickwire's Nonviolent Action as a Means of<br />\nConflict Resolution the first<br />\n<br />\ntime it was offered in 1984.<br />\nUnless the class has changed<br />\nradically since then, it is an excellent course.<br />\nWhen I took Nonviolence,<br />\nthere were 18 lectures. Fifteen<br />\ncovered such topics as civilianbased defence, Ghandi, King,<br />\nTolstoy, the bishops' peace<br />\npastoral, and war psychology.<br />\nThree, about Latin America,<br />\ncould have been described as<br />\nnot topical. This is quite a bit<br />\nbetter than \"If you want to<br />\nlearn about nonviolence,...you<br />\nwon't learn anything from<br />\nWickwire.\" Personally Nonviolence was one of the most<br />\npractical and interesting courses<br />\nI've taken at Hopkins. It showed<br />\nme an alternative to violence<br />\nthat I never before believed existed. It led me to change my<br />\nopinion on methods to fight to<br />\nend oppression, and led me to<br />\njoin a Quaker meeting.<br />\nIn fact, when the semester<br />\nended and Wickwire was<br />\nforced to retire, we got a chance<br />\nto demonstrate the value of the<br />\ncourse. A non-violent movement led by members of the<br />\nclass resulted in a faculty/student committee to oversee the<br />\nhiring of a new chaplain and<br />\nthe continuation of programs<br />\nduring the transition. My ability to contribute to the struggle<br />\nwas due to tactics and ideas<br />\nlearned in Wickwire's course.<br />\nThese tactics apply to conservative as well as liberal struggles, (anti-nukes to antiabortion).<br />\nMany professors at Hopkins<br />\nhold political opinions. These<br />\nrange from orthodox Marxism<br />\nto right-wing conservatism.<br />\nWhile I disagree politically with<br />\nmany of my professors, I still<br />\nlearn from them. If you are<br />\npolitically sensitive or if you<br />\nfind the political views of a<br />\n<br />\nmember of the civil rights<br />\nmovement so threatening that<br />\nyou can not learn from their experience, don't take Wickwire's<br />\ncourses. If you are willing to<br />\nlisten to a viewpoint very different from your own and<br />\nopenly question some of the<br />\nbasic assumptions of our society, take Nonviolence.<br />\n<br />\nOft 91Eftit, You cAN1u.

In terms of lost<br />\neducational opportunity, intersession is a major tragedy<br />\nhere because so few students attend. I myself did not attend it<br />\nthis year for three reasons<br />\nwhich I feel may be representative of the student body as a<br />\nwhole:<br />\n1) There exists an incredible<br />\ndearth of interesting and/or<br />\nuseful intersession courses; 2) I<br />\nwas \"burnt-out\" by the end of<br />\nfinal exams and needed more<br />\nthan a brief 11-day respite<br />\nbefore plunging my enfeebled<br />\nmind back into a heavy course<br />\nload at Hopkins; and 3) I<br />\ndreaded and was therefore unwilling to spend a month on<br />\nwhat I envisioned as a desolate,<br />\nvirtually abandoned campus<br />\nduring Baltimore's dreariest<br />\nmonth of January\u2014when instead I could be comfortably<br />\nvacationing with family and<br />\nfriends.<br />\nObviously, if the administration wishes more students to<br />\nenroll in intersession, the first<br />\npoint must be corrected (and<br />\neven if they don't wish it, I feel<br />\n<br />\nMONSIEICKE12120;9212M2020212020021112<br />\n<br />\nCokve Press Service<br />\n<br />\nit should be for th-2 sake of<br />\nstudents desiring involvement<br />\nin intersession). As witnessed<br />\nby this year's offerings, the present system is insufficient for<br />\nproviding interesting and useful<br />\nintersession courses. I don't<br />\nhave any specific proposal<br />\nmyself, but the plan suggested<br />\nby you in that issue of requiring new faculty to periodically<br />\nteach an intersession course on<br />\nsome type of rotation sounds<br />\npotentially effective.<br />\nWith regards to my second point, why not extend<br />\nChristmas break by a week?<br />\nThat way people could attend<br />\nintersession and still feel rested<br />\nand ready to get back into studying after their vacation.<br />\nThese two measures would effectively cure the third ailment<br />\nof intersession, as enrollment in<br />\nit would probably jump<br />\nsignificantly and being at<br />\nHopkins during Intersession<br />\nwould<br />\nno<br />\nlonger<br />\nbe<br />\nsynonymous with loneliness<br />\nand boredom.<br />\nBrook van Hamm Wiers<br />\n<br />\nTry Interaction<br />\nTo the Editor:<br />\n<br />\nTwo Pepsi Glasses with Pepsi<br />\nFor Free<br />\nWith Any Large or Medium Pizza<br />\n<br />\nItM\"NV))<br />\nS<br />\n11.1*<br />\nCHICA,GO PIZZERIA,<br />\n<br />\n:).<br />\n\u2022\u2014<br />\n;1$<br />\n:).<br />\n\u2022--<br />\n<br />\n.\u2014<br />\n;)S<br />\n<br />\nGood everyday<br />\nas long as offer lasts.<br />\n<br />\n;'5<br />\n\u2022-\u2022<br />\n;<br />\n<br />\n\u2022<br />\n;II<br />\n<br />\n151513155151MEMERI<br />\n<br />\n1.1.\"<br />\n\u2022 4\u202214\u20221001.0<br />\n<br />\nHFCX,No, MA.<br />\nIT WAS 3cEY.<br />\n<br />\n\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022 \u2022\u2022\u2022!\u202212'<br />\n.<br />\n1!..! \"Lr<br />\nI\u2022IP<br />\n\u2022:40.<br />\n;<br />\n<br />\ni;ra\"V EMMEN<br />\n<br />\nThis intersession I worked<br />\nwith a group of administrators<br />\non the Student-Faculty Interaction Program.

Just ask any<br />\nWashington College fan, willing to commit a large part of a<br />\nSaturday night to support their<br />\nteam.

While some of the<br />\ndeep fried appetizers were<br />\nrather bland, the lamb and<br />\nchicken were delicious.<br />\n<br />\nThe menu offered many<br />\nkinds of chicken, seafood,<br />\nlamb, and vegetarian entrees.<br />\nAn entire section of the menu<br />\nis devoted to Akbar's Tandoori<br />\nspecialties. \"Tandoori\" is a<br />\nmethod of firing food in a clay<br />\noven; while I did not order one<br />\nof these entrees, I was able to<br />\nsample delicious Tandoori<br />\nchicken from our appetizer<br />\ntray.<br />\nI chose the Shrimp Masala<br />\n($11.25) which was served in a<br />\nthick sauce seasoned with<br />\nginger and garlic. I found this<br />\nto be an unusual but delicious<br />\nchoice of spices.<br />\nMy guest ordered the tasty<br />\nChicken Madras ($7.95), curried chicken pieces in a very hot<br />\nand spicy sauce. Both entrees<br />\nwere served with rice, and while<br />\nthe portions of meat and<br />\nshrimp were not terribly large,<br />\nthey were excellent.<br />\nAfter dinner, both of us<br />\nordered the Kulfi Falooda<br />\n($2.25), an ice cream flavored<br />\nwith pistachio, almonds and<br />\nrose water. The flavor was subtle and the rose water made it<br />\nunique. It was the perfect complement to our spicy dinners.<br />\nAkbar is a wonderful dining<br />\nexperience. It offers a wide<br />\nvariety of unusually prepared<br />\nfoods, and the service is excellent.

That is a difficult<br />\nquestion to answer, but the<br />\ndirectors of the Shriver Hall<br />\nConcert Series have managed to<br />\ndo just that.<br />\nThe Series' twentieth anniversary concert was given last<br />\nSaturday evening in Shriver<br />\nHall as a near capacity audience<br />\nlistened with greaty pleasure to<br />\nthe evening's featured performers, the internationally<br />\nrenowned Beaux Arts Trio.<br />\nThe trio, consisting of pianist<br />\nMenahem Pressler, violinist<br />\nIsidore Cohen, and cellist Bernard Greenhouse, has toured<br />\nextensively since its inception.<br />\nThe group performs regularly<br />\nat the Library of Congress, the<br />\nMetropolitan Museum of Art,<br />\nand at concert series of Harvard, Princeton, and Johns<br />\nHopkins Universities.<br />\n<br />\nThe Beaux Arts Trio, it.<br />\ncelebrating its thirtieth anniverThe Trio's playing of the<br />\nsary season this year, has made bright first movement with its<br />\nmany appearances in the past short, staccato motives and gidtwo decades of the Series ex- dy melodies revealed the polited<br />\nistence, and their performances perhaps precious theme of the<br />\nare always one of the season's piece.

The melodic opening<br />\nled into a lyrical extended playing of the theme which was<br />\nechoed both within the parts<br />\nand from the other musicians in<br />\nthe Trio. Their execution of the<br />\nthird movement was, in the<br />\nspirit of the piece, quite<br />\nfascinating.<br />\nThe final piece on the program was the \"Trio in E minor<br />\n(Dumky)\" of Anton Dvorak.<br />\nThe name \"dumky\" in the<br />\nalternate title means literally<br />\n\"little thought,\" or \"meditation.\" The work is not organized in the traditional sonata<br />\nform, but rather in a sequence<br />\nof six pieces. Solemn and<br />\nenergetic, the piece is a study of<br />\ncontrasting themes somber and<br />\nsullen with themes full of hope<br />\nand joy.<br />\nThroughout the performance<br />\nof this piece, each of the<br />\n<br />\nmembers of the Trio<br />\ndemonstrated his more than<br />\ncapable ability in playing the<br />\nsections. Notable in this piece<br />\nwere the pianissimo piano introduction to the second section<br />\nand the tuneful cello melody in<br />\nthe fourth.<br />\nFor encore pieces, the Beaux<br />\nTrio selected Mendelssohn's<br />\n\"Trio in D minor\" and the<br />\nFinale from the \"G major<br />\nTrio\" of Franz Joseph Haydn.<br />\nThese two pieces were definitely meant the display the talents<br />\nof the Trio members, and this<br />\nthey did, to the great enjoyment<br />\nof the audience.<br />\nThe brilliance and expertise<br />\nof the Beaux Arts Trio is indisputable.

Emmett<br />\nWalsh.<br />\nby Laurah Limbrick<br />\n<br />\nWildats is yet another entry<br />\nin the recently growing genre of<br />\nwhat has been termed the \"feelgood\" movie. Starring Goldie<br />\nHawn as Mollie McGrath, a<br />\ngirls' track coach at a \"nice\"<br />\nsuburban high school, Wildcats<br />\nis the story of how Mollie takes<br />\nthe dirtiest job of them all\u2014<br />\ncoaching varsity football at<br />\nCentral High, conveniently<br />\nlocated in the ghettos of<br />\nChicago\u2014and overcomes all<br />\nobstacles to make her team the<br />\ncity champs in one short<br />\nseason.<br />\nAs far as stereotypes go,<br />\nWildcats has them in abundance. There's the male<br />\nchauvinist pig, Dan, who's the<br />\nvarsity football coach at her<br />\nhigh school\u2014\"You know me,<br />\nBabes, I'm a modern guy\";<br />\nthere's the gay Home Ec<br />\nteacher who is chosen over<br />\nMollie to coach JV football at<br />\nher high school (Prescott); and<br />\nthere's Mollie herself, a divorced mother of two, proving that<br />\nshe is worthy of respect by taking<br />\non the job no one else<br />\nMoev<br />\nwould,<br />\nand \"earning\" the<br />\nDesire<br />\nDusk and<br />\nrespect of the team.<br />\nProfile Records<br />\nThe movie itself is full of<br />\nthese<br />\ncliches; Mollie espousing<br />\nMoev, a Canadian quartet,<br />\nthe<br />\n\"I<br />\nam free and liberated\"<br />\ncreates music that is best enrhetoric<br />\nto her ex-husband; the<br />\non<br />\njoyed in bits and pieces<br />\ntaking<br />\non<br />\nof the hopeless, obsystems.<br />\nA<br />\nsound<br />\ndance club<br />\nsingle dose of Moev's music can noxious team; and, of course,<br />\nwhat sports-oriented \"feelbe wonderful, but after a few of<br />\nDusk and Desire's ten songs good\" movie would be comhave played, the ingredients plete without the Big Game<br />\nagainst her former high school,<br />\nPrescott,<br />\nnow her arch rival,<br />\n14<br />\nPage<br />\nContinued on<br />\nwhere (guess who!) none other<br />\n<br />\nthan Dan, male chauvinist pig,<br />\nis the varsity football coach.<br />\nNot only that, but this game is<br />\nfor the city championship. And<br />\nso it goes.<br />\nFor once, however, Hawn is<br />\nnot cast as a bubble-headed<br />\nblonde; she gets to show that<br />\nshe knows football better than<br />\nanyone else. When her husband<br />\nthreatens to take away custody<br />\nof the children, under the<br />\npretext that her job as coach is<br />\nnot in the best interests of the<br />\nchildren, she eventually stands<br />\nup to him, instead of giving in<br />\nas she used to do. The experience of dealing with the<br />\nguys on the team seems to have<br />\ngiven her a strength that she<br />\ndidn't have before. There is<br />\nnothing really remarkable<br />\nabout Hawn's performance;<br />\nit's just something a little different from her previous roles.<br />\nSwoosie Kurtz is also pretty<br />\naverage in her role of Verna,<br />\nMollie's sister, although to be<br />\nhonest, there isn't a whole lot<br />\nthat could be done with her<br />\nrole. Verna serves largely as a<br />\nsupport for Mollie, when she<br />\nstarts to feel guilty because her<br />\nkids think she's ignoring them.<br />\nAn amusing minor character is<br />\nthe rather wooden stereotype of<br />\nthe ex-husband's new wife; the<br />\ncharacter of Stephanie is fun to<br />\nlaugh at because you know she<br />\nisn't quite real; she's exaggerated just a bit over the line.<br />\nAll in all, Wildcats will not<br />\nmake you think, and it has no<br />\ngreat messages. It might bring<br />\non a few laughs, but the problem is that you know from the<br />\nfirst five minutes on exactly<br />\nwhat the plot is. It's pretty<br />\nmuch an average film for the<br />\ngenre, and certainly not the<br />\nworst of the new releases. I'd<br />\nonly recommend it if you really have nothing better to do.<br />\n<br />\n\f14/FEBRUARY 21, 1986<br />\n<br />\nITZA HERE<br />\nITZA FRESH<br />\nITZA HOT<br />\nITZA FAST<br />\n<br />\nC<br />\n<br />\nA22A<br />\n3r<br />\n1/<br />\nAlso sandwiches and subs to go<br />\nCall your order in<br />\nBe ready for pick up within minutes<br />\n338-7972<br />\nJHU Snack Bar, AMR II<br />\n11AM-1AM<br />\n<br />\nSchlemmer's Odd Humanoids<br />\nby Claude loss\u00b0<br />\nThe first major exhibition of<br />\nOskar Schlemmer's work in the<br />\nUnited States opened at the<br />\nBaltimore Museum of Art on<br />\nSunday, February 9. Schlemmer, though not well-known in<br />\nthe States, was a versatile and<br />\nprolific German modernist who<br />\nproduced many innovative<br />\nworks between 1911 and 1942.<br />\nThe exhibition will be in<br />\nBaltimore until April 6; then it<br />\nwill move on to New York, San<br />\nFrancisco and Minneapolis.<br />\nArnold L. Lehman and<br />\nBrenda Richardson, cocurators for the exhibition<br />\nspent over five years gathering<br />\nthe 240 works of art which<br />\nmake up one of the Museum's<br />\nmost ambitious events. The<br />\nshow contains collections of<br />\nSchlemmer's art loaned by the<br />\nStuttegart Museum, the<br />\nSchlemmer Family Estate and<br />\nmany private collectors in the<br />\nUnited Stats.<br />\nSchlemmer's work is difficult<br />\nto characterize because it<br />\nbelongs to no medium or<br />\nschool. He was a sculptor,<br />\nchoreographer, and playdirector as well as a painter. He<br />\nwas called to be the master of<br />\nsculpture, mural painting and<br />\nstage workshops at the<br />\nBauhaus, the famous hot-bed<br />\nof German art which thrived<br />\nbefore World War II. After<br />\n1933, his work was suppressed<br />\nby the Nazis and he had to take<br />\na menial job until his death in<br />\n1942. This suppression and<br />\nforced anonymity is a big<br />\nreason why his work is so unfamiliar to Americans.<br />\nSchlemmer's work spans<br />\nseveral periods, beginning in<br />\nthe early Cubist period (he contributed to an exhibit which included the works of Braque,<br />\nGleizes, Kandinsky, and others)<br />\nin 1911 to his last productions<br />\nduring the Second World War.<br />\nnever<br />\nart<br />\nSchlemmer's<br />\n\"matured\" into one style. His<br />\nwork is unified by a theme, not<br />\na style. Though a few of his early landscapes show a great<br />\nsimilarity to the Cubist efforts<br />\nof Braque and Picasso he soon<br />\nmoved away from that to concentrate on the human figure.<br />\nSchlemmer's works are<br />\npeculiar<br />\nby<br />\npopulated<br />\nhumanoid figures. They range<br />\nfrom figures which seem to be<br />\nmerely combinations of spheres<br />\nand cylinders to fully-developed<br />\nmannequin-like figures. Some<br />\nof his less-human figures may<br />\nhave one or two appendages<br />\nshaped nothing like an arm or<br />\na leg. One room in the exhibition contains figures with bats<br />\nor metal rings for arms and<br />\nwhere there should be legs,<br />\nthere is only what looks like<br />\nfunnel going into a point. On<br />\none wall, there are paintings of<br />\nthese figures and in front of<br />\nanother wall there are life-size<br />\nsculptures of the same figures.<br />\nThese oddly shaped and proportioned figures show Schlemmer's fascination with the way<br />\nthe body appears from one<br />\nposition to another, from a<br />\nstate of action to a state of rest.<br />\nAs a choreographer, he was<br />\nvery sensitive to these shifts. He<br />\n<br />\nrefines this fascination and<br />\ndevelops a theme when he pares<br />\ndown these unorthodox shapes<br />\ninto a uniform figure.<br />\nThere is a funny story behind<br />\nthe similar figures which<br />\npopulate most of Schlemmer's<br />\nwork. Schlemmer and several<br />\nfreinds all shaved their heads as<br />\na joke. Unfortunately for the<br />\nBauhaus master, his hair did<br />\nnot grow back. However,<br />\nSchlemmer used it to his advantage and, it seems, used his own<br />\nhead as the model for his<br />\nfigures. The figures in many of<br />\nhis paintings look very much<br />\nlike store-mannequins without<br />\nclothes or wigs. Schlemmer<br />\nstressed the similarities between<br />\nhumans as moving forms. The<br />\ndifferences or facial features<br />\nand gender are done away with<br />\nbecause Schlemmer's figures<br />\nhave no expressions or<br />\ngenitalia.<br />\nIt is not easy to reduce<br />\nShlemmer's work to some<br />\nmessage. Though he worked<br />\nduring a time of great social<br />\n<br />\nand political turmoil in Germany, Schlemmer didn't concentrate on political themes<br />\noften.<br />\nThe thing which attracted<br />\nthis writer most to Oskar<br />\nSchlemmer's art is the unique<br />\nway he portrays motion. As a<br />\nchoreographer, he had to be<br />\naware of how the human form<br />\nbends and twists in motion. In<br />\nhis paintings and his sculptuits,<br />\nhe captures figures at specific<br />\npoints in their action, so that<br />\nwhile each figure seems to be<br />\nvery much in motion, it also<br />\nseems to be perfectly still.<br />\nThis reporter may be totally<br />\nwrong in his interpretation of<br />\nOskar Schlemmer's art, but the<br />\nreader will never know until he<br />\ngoes to the museum to find out<br />\nfor himself.

Knopf, Inc.<br />\n$16.95. 312 pages.<br />\nby Andy Gray<br />\n<br />\n\"The bombs are real,\"<br />\nlaments the narrator of Tim<br />\nO'Brien's latest novel, The<br />\nNuclear Age. As one might imagine, this book is about growing up and living with the<br />\nspecter of nuclear war ever<br />\nthreatening in the not too dis,tant future, and how one man<br />\ncomes to grips with this brutal<br />\nreality. This is not a lighthearted book; The Nuclear Age<br />\nis a horror story, not in the<br />\ntraditional sense like the works<br />\nof Stephen King or H.P.<br />\nLovecraft, but in a way that<br />\nkeeps scaring the reader even<br />\nafter he closes the book. The<br />\nNuclear Age is about a world<br />\nthat exists, a world that is armed<br />\nto the teeth with nuclear<br />\nweapons, and if they are used,<br />\nsays O'Brien, there is absolutely<br />\nno way for you to protect<br />\nyourself.<br />\nThe plot is developed by<br />\nalternating chapters to the present and the past. The book<br />\nbegins, unusually enough, with<br />\nthe narrator getting out of bed<br />\nin the middle of the night to dig<br />\na bomb shelter. \"Am I crazy?\"<br />\nhe muses. The obvious answer<br />\nshould be yes, but the rest of<br />\nthe book appears to be an attempt to prove the narrator<br />\nsane.<br />\nTo give a chronological<br />\nhistory, the narrator, identified<br />\nas William, is developed from<br />\nchildhood. The reader is<br />\npresented with an extremely<br />\nprecocious and neurotic little<br />\nboy. William is preoccupied<br />\nwith his dreams about nuclear<br />\nwar; they are the worst of his<br />\n<br />\nchildhood nightmares, but with<br />\nthe cold, antiseptic sting of<br />\nplausability that no youth's<br />\nnightmare ever has. His dreams<br />\noften begin with the advent of<br />\nthe nuclear holocaust, followed<br />\nby flashes of red and yellow<br />\nlights. A bit cliched, but more<br />\nimaginative are his descriptions<br />\nof the results:<br />\nThe planet tilted. Kansas was<br />\nburning. Hot lava flowed<br />\ndown the streets of Chicago.<br />\nIt was all there, each detail:<br />\nManhattan sank into the sea,<br />\nNew Mexico flared up and<br />\nvanished. All across the<br />\ncountry, washing machines<br />\nkicked into their spin cycles,<br />\nradios blared, oceans bubbled, jets scrambled, vending<br />\nmachines emptied themselves, the Everglades went<br />\nbone dry. Marble churches<br />\nburned like kindling.<br />\nThe description continues,<br />\ngrowing more explicit and personal. The terror grows to be<br />\ntoo much for the young boy, so<br />\nhe decides to build a bomb<br />\nshelter. Of course it is quite<br />\ncrude, made out of a ping-pong<br />\ntable and odds and ends from<br />\nhis basement. It is a placebo,<br />\nand William feels secure in his<br />\nmakeshift shelter. And this is<br />\nthe main theme of the book,<br />\nthat the threat of nuclear war is<br />\nso great that one must always try<br />\nto find some sort of protection<br />\nfrom it. The sad truth,<br />\nhowever, is that any form of<br />\nprotection would be, at best, a<br />\ndelusion.<br />\nWilliam spends a fair<br />\namount of time convincing<br />\nhimself, and in turn the reader,<br />\nthat nuclear war is indeed a real<br />\npossibility. \"Go ahead, say the<br />\nwords,\" the narrator implores<br />\n\"nuclear<br />\nreader,<br />\nthe<br />\nwar.\"Say it out loud.\" In<br />\nsome way, verbalizing does give<br />\nmore validity to the concept of<br />\n<br />\nnuclear war. It doesn't<br />\ndrastically alter one's concept<br />\nof nuclear war, but it does give<br />\na person the opportunity to<br />\ncontemplate a reality that is<br />\notherwise lost in an introspective society. \"The Bombs are<br />\nreal,\" chides William.<br />\nThe book is extremely well<br />\nwritten. O'Brien has an easygoing, almost tender style of<br />\nwriting that eases the pages<br />\nalong. Further, the unique format of the book works well,<br />\ndeveloping the characters<br />\nthrough two story lines, with<br />\neach new chapter developing a<br />\nnew facet of William's personality, each facet being<br />\ncarefully rationalized. These rationalizations help William to<br />\nprove his sanity, despite his<br />\notherwise irrational behavior<br />\ndue to the possibility of nuclear<br />\nwar. They also provide<br />\ncredibility to the character for<br />\nthe reader, regardless of<br />\nwhether or not the reader<br />\nagrees with William's particular<br />\nviews and actions.<br />\nOddly enough, despite all the<br />\nwork on caricature through rationalization, William appears<br />\nsomewhat flat or one sided, but<br />\nthis may well be intended.<br />\nWilliam's most overwhelming<br />\nof<br />\nis one<br />\nimpression<br />\nhelplessness, that of a small<br />\npart in a massive international<br />\nsystem, having no real effect on<br />\nhis own destiny. It is a bizarre<br />\nanalogy; that we are all in many<br />\nways helpless should the international balance of power<br />\ndeteriorate to the actual use of<br />\nnuclear warheads.<br />\nIn sum, this book is worth<br />\nreading. It's well written and<br />\nquite captivating. While many<br />\nmay not agree with the way in<br />\nwhich nuclear war is dealt with<br />\nin this book, it is still very inthought<br />\nand<br />\nteresting<br />\nprovoking.<br />\n<br />\nKansas was burning.

He is an associate<br />\nprofessor in the Writing<br />\nSeminars department, teaching<br />\nfiction and twentieth-century<br />\nliterature. His latest work is a<br />\nnovel called Fall and Rise. Dixon and I talked in his office in<br />\nGilman.<br />\nI never thought of myself as<br />\na writer, you know, until I was<br />\ntwenty-three or four. I grew up<br />\nin New York. My father was a<br />\ndentist; my mother was an interior designer. I went to public<br />\nschools, public high schools,<br />\nand then city college, a public<br />\ncollege, thinking I would<br />\nbecome a newsman. I had two<br />\nolder brothers who were<br />\nnewsmen. I worked for NBC as<br />\na copyboy for a couple of years<br />\nand then graduated. I did very<br />\npoorly in all of my academic<br />\nwork, from public school<br />\nthrough college. I was never a<br />\nstudent. What happened after<br />\ncollege was that I worked as an<br />\nartists' model and had an<br />\n<br />\naborted lover affair and felt a painter. Also, by that time, I<br />\nvery sad and decided to take the was beginning to write plays.<br />\nthree, four hundred dollars I And then I got a job as a<br />\nhad and go to Mexico and newsman in an elevator in<br />\nWashington. I was in the<br />\npaint.<br />\npainter?<br />\nwith my brother, who<br />\na<br />\nelevator<br />\nonce<br />\nwere<br />\nSo you<br />\nWell. I thought of myself as was a newsman, and somebody<br />\n\u2022 ..\u2022<br />\n. .<br />\n<br />\nsaid, \"Will you work for News<br />\nAssociates for two weeks? We<br />\nneed somebody to fill in.\" I<br />\nstayed for two years. It was a<br />\ngood job and the best job, really, that I ever had in the sense<br />\nof how much I learned. And<br />\nhow much I found I could do<br />\nthat I never thought I could.<br />\nAnd while there, I started to<br />\nwrite seriously.<br />\nI was always a very good<br />\nreader and I would sit home<br />\nevery night after work. I made<br />\nfifty-five dollars a week, so I<br />\ndidn't have much money,<br />\ndidn't have a car or anything<br />\nlike that and would drink and<br />\nread. And that was the way I<br />\nspent the first three, four<br />\nmonths of my months as a<br />\nnewsman. Then I said I should<br />\ndo something else. Then I<br />\nremembered I'd once thought<br />\nabout writing. I'd written a<br />\ncouple of stories in college and,<br />\nso I started to write. That's<br />\nwhen I really got involved in<br />\nwriting . ..Since 1961, I've been<br />\nwriting fiction and from then<br />\non, I'd take a job, make<br />\nenough money to save and then<br />\nquit and from then on, I'd take<br />\n<br />\na job, make enough money to<br />\nsave and then quit and then<br />\nwrite. But I always wrote every<br />\nday. When the job was 8:30 to<br />\n3:00\u2014that was the schoolteacher<br />\njob I had in New York for<br />\nseven or eight years\u2014I'd get up<br />\nat 6:00 and work.<br />\nHow would you describe the<br />\ntype of story you write?<br />\nI'm very interested in writing<br />\npersonal stories.

In<br />\nother words, to get very deep,<br />\nclose. And so sometimes, I take<br />\nparticulars from my own life,<br />\nwhich means my father's life,<br />\nmy mother's life, and include<br />\nthem in stories.<br />\nI try not to divulge anything<br />\nabout my own personal life,<br />\nbecause I don't want to sort of<br />\ncreate that dual reading that<br />\nreaders might have and say<br />\n\"Oh, this is about Steve Dixon's life.\" So really. not that<br />\nmuch is known about me.<br />\n<br />\nContinued on Page 17<br />\n<br />\n\fNEWS-LETTER/17<br />\n<br />\nDixon\u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022<br />\nSo your stories are somewhat<br />\nautobiographical.<br />\nWell, some are and some<br />\naren't, but I'm not going to<br />\nreveal which are.

In<br />\neverything I write, there's some<br />\nelement of autobiography.<br />\nThe stories do draw from<br />\nreal-life then.<br />\nCertainly, you know, in the<br />\ndialogue you often take from<br />\nthe people who are closest to<br />\nyou.

If the story<br />\nis just too personal for<br />\nsomebody else, not for me but<br />\nfor somebody else, then I won't<br />\nwrite it. I'll store it away in my<br />\nmind someplace.<br />\nKnowing you, I've noticed<br />\nthat some of your characters<br />\nresemble you physically.

At the Johns<br />\nbookstore,<br />\nHopkins<br />\ndownstairs, I was looking at<br />\nsome books and I hear<br />\nsomebody say, \"This book,<br />\nMovies,\" and he brings it over<br />\nto the information desk and he<br />\nsays, \"This book is not about<br />\nmovies. I want my money<br />\nback.\" So they wrote a receipt<br />\nand he got his money back.<br />\nAbout the new kind of<br />\nmarketing: what do you think<br />\nof Andy Warhol's idea offifteen minutes of fame for<br />\neveryone, and all that.<br />\nI'm a pretty open, frank,<br />\nsociable person. I don't believe<br />\n<br />\nWhat about PEN?<br />\nI'm leaving PEN myself.<br />\nFirst of all, I feel any organization that would name Norman<br />\nMailer as President is not one<br />\nI want to belong to. I do feel<br />\nthat PEN is very often a group<br />\nthat is sort of directed toward<br />\neach individual in the upper<br />\nhierarchy. You know, doing<br />\nthings for themselves. It has<br />\ngood motives in getting writers<br />\nout of prison, but just that is<br />\nnot enough for me to want to<br />\njoin. I didn't feel good even<br />\njoining...I've only gone to two<br />\nPEN meetings. One was about<br />\ntranslators. I sat through it and<br />\nfound there was a lot of selfpromotion going on among<br />\neverybody there. The other one<br />\nwas when I was inducted. I<br />\nthought, \"Wow, I'm inducted<br />\ninto PEN.\" That was a big surprise, you know,somebody has<br />\nto nominate you. I thought, I'll<br />\nbe one of eight or nine inducted. I go there, there are<br />\naobut two hundred people being inducted at the same time.<br />\nThe induction meant giving you<br />\na slip that said,\"You are entitled to two free drinks.\" It was<br />\njust awful, an awful party, so<br />\nI left.<br />\nSome artists get togetherfor<br />\na common cause, like publicizing the arms race. What do you<br />\nthink of the politics involved in<br />\nwriter's groups?<br />\nI don't really like signing<br />\nanything. But if I felt my<br />\nsignature was something that<br />\ncould help somebody in some<br />\nbad situation, I'd probably<br />\nsign. . .In PEN, all the issues<br />\nseem to be diluted and almost<br />\nsecondary to the continuation<br />\nfor its members and for its<br />\nleaders. That's my gripe with<br />\nthem. My gripe with them was<br />\ninviting George Schultz, a nonwriter, to speak. But all that has<br />\nbeen in the news, said more articulately by other guys.<br />\nDo politicsfind their way in-<br />\n<br />\nto your writing?<br />\nNo, nothing like party<br />\nsides. . . Sort of universally<br />\npolitical. Many of my stories<br />\nare about victims. In Encountering Revolution, what<br />\ngave me that idea is my feeling<br />\ntoward victims. When I was<br />\nwriting that, I was probably<br />\nthinking of Nicaragua. You<br />\nhave a revolution and then you<br />\nhave the counter-revolution.<br />\nIt's always going to be bad for<br />\nthe normal person in the street,<br />\nthey're the victims. That's as<br />\nfar as my politics go, in my<br />\nwriting.<br />\nWhat do you think of your<br />\nwork's reception, by the public<br />\nand by the critics? What is your<br />\nplace among American writers?<br />\nI don't really think of it. I<br />\ndon't think of myself in any<br />\nparticular place regarding other<br />\nwriters. I don't want to feel<br />\ncompetitive. I think that's<br />\nsomething that would help<br />\ndestroy my writing...That<br />\ndoesn't have any use.<br />\nTo me, it's just a surprise\u2022<br />\nthat my work is published.<br />\nWhen each book is taken, I'm<br />\nvery grateful, thankful. I can't<br />\ndeny I wouldn't mind each<br />\nbook having a little better<br />\nreception than the others. But<br />\nthey've gotten good reviews,<br />\nthey've gotten bad reviews. But<br />\nthey have gotten a few intelligent critical appraisals in<br />\nbooks, in magazines. That's<br />\nokay.

So, you<br />\nknow, I've gotten awards, I've<br />\nreceived fellowships and I got<br />\nthis job, because of my<br />\nwriting...<br />\nI love to write.

The talk is not<br />\nabout the 10-14 record. Not<br />\nmentioned are the high expectations that were never realized.<br />\nNo, when the Men's Varsity<br />\nHoops team gathers for the<br />\ncelebration, the only thing<br />\nremembered will be the 83-79<br />\n.upset of nationally ranked<br />\nWashington College.<br />\nOf course, by the time the<br />\nreunion rolls around, the story<br />\nof \"The Win\" will have been<br />\ntold a hundred times over. And<br />\nof course, the truth will have<br />\nbeen stretched and yanked and<br />\npulled in every direction.<br />\nBy that time, Washington<br />\nCollege will have been the national champion with two seven<br />\nfooters. . .one of them a point<br />\nguard.<br />\nBut it doesn't really matter<br />\nanyway. The Blue Jay's upset<br />\nof the Shoremen was one of the<br />\nbiggest in Hopkins history; certainly the biggest in coach Nad<br />\nDoherty's era. And if you were<br />\nat home watching Dorothy and<br />\nToto, shame on ya, because<br />\nyou missed a thriller!<br />\nThe two teams went at each<br />\nother for forty minutes about<br />\nas hard as could be done. The<br />\nlead never stretched more than<br />\nnine points. Just as Washington<br />\nlooked as if it would pull away<br />\nlate, Mike Kowatch got a steal,<br />\n<br />\nSports Archives<br />\n<br />\nRalph (French) Horne blows past an opponent for one of the many baskets of his distinguished Hopkins<br />\ncareer. Horne hung up his shoes on a winning note last Saturday.<br />\n<br />\nHopkins trailed 78-73 with<br />\nChris Wasson hit a jumper and<br />\nthe Jays were back within four. 1:37 remaining before Kowatch<br />\nHopkins kicked and scratched picked off an errant pass due to<br />\nto stay in the game and then the Jays trapping defense.<br />\nwhen it came down to the Kowatch is fouled and hit both<br />\nstripe, 15 feet from the hoop, ends to pull the squad to within<br />\nthe Jays scored. Remarkably, three, at 78-75. Going for the<br />\neach team shot 69 shots and steal in the backcourt, Kevin<br />\neach team hit 30 of them. The Sottak, who came off the bench<br />\ndifference was the Jays hit 23 of with a great effort, put<br />\n30 foul shots. The Shoremen hit Washington back on the foul<br />\nline. His first shot was good,<br />\n19 of 29.<br />\n<br />\nbut the second bounced deep<br />\noff the rim, back to the<br />\nShoremen. But Wasson forced<br />\na steal that Charlie Sikorsky<br />\ngrabbed and hit Wasson for a<br />\nlayup, 79-77 with 1:14 left.<br />\nKowatch<br />\nthen<br />\nput<br />\nWashington back on the charity stripe with a foul in the<br />\nbackcourt. Dave Wilson rebounded the missed shot and<br />\nthe Jays had a chance to tie<br />\n<br />\nwith less than a minute left.<br />\nChris Wasson, who missed two<br />\njumpers not three minutes<br />\nbefore from the same spot,<br />\nswished a 20-footer from the<br />\ntop of the key.<br />\n\"With Chris, that is his<br />\nshot,\" said Doherty. \"That's<br />\nlike a layup for everyone else.\"<br />\nWasson's layup ties the game<br />\nfor the first time in ten minutes<br />\nat 79-79. Washington College<br />\nthen slows the ball down to run<br />\nof the final :42 for a last shot.<br />\nThe Shoremen shoot a jumper<br />\nthat missed but Washington's<br />\nTom Advil grabbed the rebound underneath. Terry Ryan<br />\ncommitted a good foul to stop<br />\nthe easy hoop and put Advil<br />\nand the foul line. Advil misses<br />\nbut again the Shoremen get the<br />\nbound. Instead of holding the<br />\nball again, Washington's Kurt<br />\nKeller, probably the best player<br />\nin the conference, forced a shot<br />\nand Kowatch grabbed the rebound and got fouled.<br />\nSo here is senior Mike<br />\nKowatch in his final game as a<br />\nBlue Jay with the score tied at<br />\n79-79 with :11 left standing at<br />\nthe foul line. These are the last<br />\ntwo shots Kowatch will shoot<br />\nfor Hopkins. Ladies and<br />\nGentlemen, this is pressure.<br />\n\"I knew I was going to hit<br />\nthem,\" said Kowatch. \"We<br />\ncame too far to lose it so I knew<br />\nthis one was meant to be.\"<br />\nKowatch hit nothing but net<br />\non both free throws and the<br />\nContinued on Page 22<br />\n<br />\nSeasoned Lady Jays Should Be Ripe For '87<br />\nby Christopher Szeles<br />\n<br />\nSwami Ramachandran<br />\n<br />\nDespite a Disapointing Season, Coach Kay Fowler Dressler feels her Lady<br />\nHoopsters will be experienced and stronger in the '86-'87 season.<br />\n<br />\nThe women's basketball<br />\nteam completed their gruelling<br />\nseason with an emotional win<br />\nover Goucher to raise their<br />\nrecord to a disappointing 2-18.<br />\nWith a little luck, Hopkins<br />\ncould have had improved their<br />\nmark to 6-14. The Jays lost 4<br />\ndecisions decided by 6 points or<br />\nless.

She senses, \"They<br />\nhave gained from their experiences this season.

Harper<br />\nranked 19th nationally late in<br />\nthe season in scoring. She shot<br />\na scorching 44 percent from the<br />\n<br />\nfield. Coach Dressler feels,<br />\n\"She has shown repeated<br />\nbrilliant performances with her<br />\nincredible ability on the fast<br />\nbreak.\" She shattered the<br />\nHopkins single game scoring<br />\nrecord with her 39-point effort<br />\nagainst Notre Dame.

She just missed<br />\nHopkins' single game and<br />\nseason marks for blocks. She<br />\nswatted away 9 shots against<br />\nHood, and all Hopkins' blocking record seem in jeopardy.<br />\nSpengler added a viable inside<br />\nscoring threat. She averaged 6.0<br />\npoints per game and had some<br />\noutstanding<br />\noffensive<br />\ncontributions.<br />\nSophomore guard Jeanne<br />\nClark had a fabulous season as<br />\nshe scored 8.5 points per game.<br />\nShe led the Jays in field goal<br />\npercentage with a sizzling 44<br />\npercent and shot well from the<br />\nline(66 percent). She was relied<br />\non heavily as their ball handler<br />\nand was able to contribute with<br />\nher good outside shooting.<br />\nCaptain Rachelle LaForce<br />\nadded 14.1 per game and led<br />\n<br />\nHopkins in free throws and free<br />\nthrow percentage (70 percent).<br />\nShe scored 36 points in<br />\nHopkins' final 2 efforts. Coach<br />\nDressler acknowledges, \"Her<br />\nconsistent outside shooting<br />\nmakes her very valuable in the<br />\noffensive attack.\"<br />\nSusie Stickney had a good<br />\nseason and collected an incredible 29 steals.

But I have some<br />\nquestions.<br />\nThe clock in women's collegiate basketball is 30 seconds.<br />\nThe clock in the NBA is 24. So<br />\nwhy is the men's clock 45<br />\nseconds? Why should it take<br />\nthem 15 seconds longer to move<br />\nthe ball downcourt than it takes<br />\nwomen?<br />\nI think the assets of the<br />\nclock, which will be in effect in<br />\nthe NCAA's Division I this<br />\nyear, are many.<br />\nFirst, there will be no more<br />\n\"bore\" games, no 19-12 or<br />\n13-11 stuff. Another asset is<br />\nthat the coaches will now<br />\nrecruit more small guards for<br />\noutside shooting. And that, in<br />\nreality, the game will be played<br />\nquicker only in the minds of the<br />\nplayers, while the actral scores<br />\nwill not increase.<br />\nNow for the liabilities. The<br />\nclock will help the schools with<br />\nthe best material. The rich will<br />\nget richer. Remember, all the<br />\nrules that have been instituted<br />\nin the last 10 years have been an<br />\nasset to the dynasties, and this<br />\nis no different.<br />\nAll teams will be playing<br />\npostage-stamp zones, especially at the tailend of the 45<br />\nseconds. What you're going to<br />\nsee, during each 45-second bite,<br />\nare multiple faces on the<br />\n<br />\npen in the future: The threepoint play will be put back in<br />\nas a counter-balance, and<br />\nbecause of this, they'll lower<br />\nthe men's clock to 30 seconds,<br />\nto be equal with the ladies. And<br />\neventually, there will be no<br />\nclock used during the last two<br />\nor three minutes of the game.<br />\nGiven all this, there will be<br />\nno possible way a patsy or<br />\nheavy underdog can beat a<br />\ntop-40 team. And what that<br />\nmeans is that each of our top-40<br />\nteams, the Miller American<br />\nguys who are perenially NCAAbound, will have a minimum of<br />\nseven automatic wins.<br />\nHey, I favor the clock. But<br />\nyou have to put the three-point<br />\nplay in because without it,<br />\ndefense. First, you'll see you're going to create a situapressure upcourt, a hard man- tion where you see nothing but<br />\nto-man, then the team is going zones.

The Coalition is a recently<br />\nformed group that wants to<br />\nunify various student efforts in<br />\nconvincing the Trustees to support the divestiture of all<br />\nholdings in companies that<br />\noperate in South Africa.<br />\nColombo said the administration was not going to<br />\nmove the deomonstration away<br />\nfrom the M.S.E. Library, but<br />\nthat the site of the demonstration was a \"violation of<br /><br />\nUniversity policy.\" When asked about a possible penalty for<br />\nthe violation, Colombo said, \"I<br />\ndon't know. We can't judge the<br />\nevent before it happens.\"<br />\nColombo also said that other<br /><br />\nSouth<br />\nAfrica<br />\ndemonstrations have occurred<br />\nthat were not in front of Levering in past years and the<br />\nUniversity's policy has still survived.

Asta<br />\nOn Thursday, February<br />\n27th, twenty-five Hopkins<br />\nstudents will attend a lobby in<br />\nWashington, D.C., run by the<br />\nStudent Coalition for Soviet<br />\nJewry in association with the<br />\nStudent Struggle for Soviet<br />\nJewry and the National Conference for Soviet Jewry. The<br />\npurpose of the lobby, says<br />\nHopkins organizer Bennett<br />\nDegen, is \"to put pressure on<br />\nthe United States to put<br />\npressure on the Soviet Union<br />\nfor fundamental human rights<br />\nfor Soviet Jews.\"<br />\nThe Hopkins group, in<br />\nassociation with the Hopkins<br />\nJewish Student Association,<br />\nwill attend workshops, listen to<br />\nspeeches from members of<br />\nCongress, and lobby their<br />\nrespective congressmen on the<br />\nbehalf of Soviet Jews, according to Degen.<br />\nthe<br />\nestimates<br />\nDegen<br />\nWashington turnout to be \"a<br />\ncouple of thousand\" in<br />\nrecognition of International<br />\nStudent Solidarity Day. The<br />\nlobby includes such Congress<br />\nmembers as Sen. Paul Simon,<br />\nSen. John C. Dansforth, Rep.<br />\nSteve Bartlett, and Rep. Robert<br />\nGarcia. The wife of Anatoly<br />\nScharansky was originally on<br />\nthe executive council of the lobby board; however, Degen<br />\ndoubts she will be present in<br />\nlight of Scharansky's recent<br /><br />\nleader of the Refusnik Movement,\" a group of Jews in the<br />\nSoviet Union whose requests to<br />\nobtain exit visas are denied. An<br />\nadded dimension to the rally,<br />\nsays Degen, is \"to show the<br />\nKremlin that, although we are<br />\nhappy about Scharansky's<br />\nrelease, we will not be satisfied<br />\nuntil all are allowed to immigrate to Israel.\"<br />\nThe goals of the Student<br />\nCoalition for Soviet Jewry are<br />\nto guarantee to Soviet Jews<br />\n\"the right to their own culture,<br />\nthe right to practice their<br />\nreligion, and the right to live in<br />\nthe land of their choice,\" according to Degen.<br />\nFounded at Brandeis University in the 70's, the Student<br />\nCoalition for Soviet Jewry accuses the Soviet Union of<br />\ndisregarding the Helsinki Accords of 1975. They see the<br /><br />\nrights of Soviet Jews violated in<br />\nboth human rights and fundamental freedoms, said<br />\nDegen.<br />\nSome points made by the<br />\ncoalition are that it is illegal to<br />\nteach Hebrew in the Soviet<br />\nUnion, that the government<br />\ndoes not recognize the State of<br />\nIsrael and its right to exist, that<br />\nJews adhering to their faith are<br />\nsent to Siberian concentration<br />\ncamps, and that Refusniks lose<br />\ntheir jobs, suffer harrassment,<br />\nand become second class<br />\ncitizens.<br />\nDegen has been active in the<br />\nStudent Struggle for Soviet<br />\nJewry and the Greater New<br />\nYork Conference of Soviet<br />\nJewry for 8 years.

Well over half of those<br />\nvoting-56 percent\u2014favored divestment. In all, 409 people voted for divestment, 73 more than voted for Paul Kadri<br />\nlast year.<br />\nThe referendum was called, Council<br />\nmembers said two weeks ago, to gauge<br />\nstudent feeling on the issue of South<br />\nAfrican investments. Although it was<br />\nnever stated openly, the clear implication<br /><br />\nwas that if students endorsed divestment,<br />\nthe Council would too. That was a<br />\nthoroughly reasonable position, since the<br />\nCouncil was not elected to deliberate on<br />\npolitical issues, and generally should<br />\navoid such matters.<br />\nAnd yet, despite the endorsement of<br />\ndivestment by the student body, the<br />\nCouncil refused to sign the so-called<br />\n\"Points of Unity\" the Hopkins Coalition for a Free South Africa has been<br />\npushing.<br />\nWhy? Well, there are probably several<br />\nreasons. First, University Treasurer<br />\nRiggs Griffith must have convinced<br />\nseveral Council members that divestment<br />\nis a bad idea. Second, some members<br />\nbelieve that since people who favor<br />\ndivestment were more likely to vote than<br />\nthose who oppose it, the results were<br />\nessentially meaningless. And last, there<br />\nwere no doubt some members who were<br />\nsimply intransigent, and who were going<br />\nto ignore the vote totals no matter what.<br />\nIn any event, it is a pity the Council<br />\ndid not endorse divestment. Having quite<br />\nrightly declared the matter beyond its<br />\ncompetence, the Council had referred the<br />\nissue to the voters. It should have listened to what they said.<br /><br />\nCommemoration Day<br />\nWhen the faculty and the Trustees and<br />\nthose ever-present \"distinguished<br />\nguests\" all get together later today to<br />\ncommemorate the 110th anniversary of<br />\nthe University, everybody will no doubt<br />\nbe cheerful and happy and optimistic and<br />\nsay wonderful things about this great institution that stands at the forefront of<br />\nAmerican higher education and is a<br />\nleader in research efforts and was the<br />\nfirst true university in America and is a<br />\nmonument to the legacy of Johns<br />\nHopkins and fields a great lacrosse team<br />\nand has a really neat clock tower<br />\nand<br />\nWell, we have a word of caution: This<br />\nis not the time to be patting ourselves on<br />\nthe back, it is the time to be kicking<br />\nourselves in the rear. Hopkins may well<br />\nbe a highly-respected pillar of academe,<br />\nbut it is also a university in dire need of<br />\na thorough re-evaluation.<br />\nTo go step-by-step: the faculty is narrow and myopic in its devotion to<br />\nacademic research and is widely perceived as caring little (if at all) about<br />\nundergraduates; the students are a selfish<br />\nlot who cannot seem to conceive of<br />\nanything more important than getting into medical school; and the administration is just generally incompetent.<br />\nAs an example, take the faculty's<br />\ntraditional hostility to Spring Fair. The<br />\nfaculty has always hated the Fair, principally because its precious academic<br />\nresearch cannot be interrupted for all<br />\nof\u2014one day! That's really why the Fair<br />\nno longer has music on Friday.<br />\nThe students are not much better. The<br />\nbiggest student protest in our memory<br /><br />\noccurred not because of South African<br />\ninvestment or alcohol policy or tuition<br />\nincreases, but because of a proposal to<br />\nclose the Hut. In other words, what<br />\nscares Hopkins students most is the idea<br />\nthat they won't be able to study at 4 a.m.<br />\nIndeed, we are known nationwide as one<br />\nof the most boring, overly-professional<br />\nstudent bodies in the country.<br />\nAnd as for the administration? Well,<br />\nwhere should we begin? Just this year<br />\nalone, it has come to light that the<br />\npowers that be were duped into signing<br />\na ridiculous food service contract, made<br />\ninnumerable goofs in organizing the dormitory telephone service, offended the<br />\nneighbors and generally contiliued to<br />\nfoul up the situation at WJHU.<br />\nBut having sounded sufficiently<br />\nlugubrious, let us add that the situation<br />\nisn't hopeless. An effort can be made to<br />\nincrease the stress placed on teaching<br />\n(from nil to slight, at least) when awarding tenure. Similarly, we can try to<br />\nrecruit high school seniors with strong<br />\nrecords in extracurricular activities, and<br />\nwith interests in fields other than the<br />\nsciences. And perhaps even the administration can admit its checkered<br />\npast, and resolve to stay on its toes in the<br />\nfuture.<br />\nOur point is that resting on our<br />\nprestigious name won't do anyone any<br />\ngood. Instead, we must all candidly<br />\nassess the University's(many) problems,<br />\nand seek ways to solve them.<br />\nAs Hopkins enters its twelfth decade,<br />\nit would do well to make today less an<br />\noccasion for celebration, and more an<br />\nopportunity for recommitment.<br /><br />\nTheater at Hopkins is a<br />\nvaluable thing. It is one of the<br />\nfew glowing jewels in a vast<br />\ndesert of sand. Glowing, but<br />\nnot sparkling. Like most jewels,<br />\nHopkins theater needs a good<br />\npolishing in order to reveal its<br />\ntrue beauty.<br />\nWhy the metaphors? Mostly<br />\nto soften the distasteful lack of<br />\nattention that the administra-<br /><br />\nbe rented at a cost of several<br />\nhundred dollars, or they must<br />\nbe borrowed from the Writing<br />\nSeminars department at great<br />\ninconvenience.<br />\nAnother area that needs<br />\nwork is the sound system, or<br />\nlack therof. Currently, there is<br />\nno sound system that can be<br />\noperated from the control<br />\nbooth.<br /><br />\nmike kupritz<br />\ntion, specfically the SAC has<br />\npaid to the needs of people interested in theater at Hopkins.<br />\nI'm not talking about the quality of instruction, which is firstrate. I'm talking about the fact<br />\nthat existing equipment provided<br />\nby the university to performance groups on this campus is<br />\nbarely adequate for even the<br />\nleast ambitous of productions.<br />\nAside from Shriver Hall<br />\nauditorium, which is prohibitively expensive for small productions to use, there is one<br />\n\"major\" theater faacility at<br />\nHomewood: the L-V room.<br />\nThere is also the Little Theater,<br />\nwhich is considerably smaller.<br />\nThe L-V room is used by<br />\nvarious groups. These include<br />\nthe Barnstormers (the major<br />\ntheater group on campus), the<br />\nWriting Seminars department<br />\n(Arellano's productions), and<br />\nof course, Edward Albee's intersession courses.<br />\nThere are a lot of technical<br />\nproblems with the L-V room,<br />\naccording to Edward Albee and<br />\ninformed sources in the Writing<br />\nSeminars department.

Someone ought to<br />\nremind the SAC that the letters<br />\nin the name \"L-V room\" stand<br />\nfor \"Listening and Viewing.\"<br />\nWithout adequate sound and<br />\nlight, these two endeavors are<br />\nsomewhat difficult.<br />\nConsidering the hundreds of<br />\nthousands of dollars it will take<br />\nper year to run the new radio<br />\nstation, a few thousand dollars<br />\nfo theater seems a drop in the<br />\nbucket.

On behalf<br />\nof the Editorial Board of The<br />\nGoucher Quindecim, may I say<br />\nthat that unappealing combination, most often found in the<br />\npaper's \"humor\" or \"opinion\"<br />\ncolumns, recently made its way<br />\nto the front page where it passed<br />\nas \"journalism.\"<br />\nThe Feb. 7 edition of the<br />\nNews-Letter offered about the<br />\nmost unedifying account of<br />\ncoeducational<br />\nGoucher's<br />\ndeliberations imaginable.<br />\nHeadlined \"Goucher Contemplates Sex Change,\" the article got second billing\u2014<br />\nevidently someone thought it<br />\nless newsworthy than an assault<br />\nin a Charles Street apartment<br />\nbuilding. But our quarrel is less<br />\nwith the article's placement<br />\nthan with its content. Why was<br />\na freshman, whose ignorance of<br />\nproper journalistic practice was<br />\nmanifest, assigned so consequential a story? Jon Stempel,<br />\nthe reporter in question spoke<br />\nto not a single Goucher student<br />\nor faculty member. He quoted<br />\none of this newspaper's editors<br />\nfrom the Baltimore Sun, a<br />\nshort-cut of which no selfrespecting journalist would<br />\navail himself.<br />\nStempel did summon the<br />\nenergy to speak to Goucher's<br /><br />\ndirector of public relations.<br />\nStempel lacked the initiative,<br />\nwhile at Goucher, to ask a student for her views on the matter; instead, he asked the good<br />\nole boys of the Hopkins fraternities how they thought a co-ed<br />\nGoucher might impact their<br />\nlifestyles. The response was<br />\npredictable. We are worried,<br />\nsaid the frat brothers, that our<br />\nlines of supply, so to speak,<br />\nmight be endangered.

I took Wickwire's Nonviolent Action as a Means of<br />\nConflict Resolution the first<br /><br />\ntime it was offered in 1984.<br />\nUnless the class has changed<br />\nradically since then, it is an excellent course.<br />\nWhen I took Nonviolence,<br />\nthere were 18 lectures. Fifteen<br />\ncovered such topics as civilianbased defence, Ghandi, King,<br />\nTolstoy, the bishops' peace<br />\npastoral, and war psychology.<br />\nThree, about Latin America,<br />\ncould have been described as<br />\nnot topical. This is quite a bit<br />\nbetter than \"If you want to<br />\nlearn about nonviolence,...you<br />\nwon't learn anything from<br />\nWickwire.\" Personally Nonviolence was one of the most<br />\npractical and interesting courses<br />\nI've taken at Hopkins. It showed<br />\nme an alternative to violence<br />\nthat I never before believed existed. It led me to change my<br />\nopinion on methods to fight to<br />\nend oppression, and led me to<br />\njoin a Quaker meeting.<br />\nIn fact, when the semester<br />\nended and Wickwire was<br />\nforced to retire, we got a chance<br />\nto demonstrate the value of the<br />\ncourse. A non-violent movement led by members of the<br />\nclass resulted in a faculty/student committee to oversee the<br />\nhiring of a new chaplain and<br />\nthe continuation of programs<br />\nduring the transition. My ability to contribute to the struggle<br />\nwas due to tactics and ideas<br />\nlearned in Wickwire's course.<br />\nThese tactics apply to conservative as well as liberal struggles, (anti-nukes to antiabortion).<br />\nMany professors at Hopkins<br />\nhold political opinions. These<br />\nrange from orthodox Marxism<br />\nto right-wing conservatism.<br />\nWhile I disagree politically with<br />\nmany of my professors, I still<br />\nlearn from them. If you are<br />\npolitically sensitive or if you<br />\nfind the political views of a<br /><br />\nmember of the civil rights<br />\nmovement so threatening that<br />\nyou can not learn from their experience, don't take Wickwire's<br />\ncourses. If you are willing to<br />\nlisten to a viewpoint very different from your own and<br />\nopenly question some of the<br />\nbasic assumptions of our society, take Nonviolence.<br /><br />\nOft 91Eftit, You cAN1u.

In terms of lost<br />\neducational opportunity, intersession is a major tragedy<br />\nhere because so few students attend. I myself did not attend it<br />\nthis year for three reasons<br />\nwhich I feel may be representative of the student body as a<br />\nwhole:<br />\n1) There exists an incredible<br />\ndearth of interesting and/or<br />\nuseful intersession courses; 2) I<br />\nwas \"burnt-out\" by the end of<br />\nfinal exams and needed more<br />\nthan a brief 11-day respite<br />\nbefore plunging my enfeebled<br />\nmind back into a heavy course<br />\nload at Hopkins; and 3) I<br />\ndreaded and was therefore unwilling to spend a month on<br />\nwhat I envisioned as a desolate,<br />\nvirtually abandoned campus<br />\nduring Baltimore's dreariest<br />\nmonth of January\u2014when instead I could be comfortably<br />\nvacationing with family and<br />\nfriends.<br />\nObviously, if the administration wishes more students to<br />\nenroll in intersession, the first<br />\npoint must be corrected (and<br />\neven if they don't wish it, I feel<br /><br />\nMONSIEICKE12120;9212M2020212020021112<br /><br />\nCokve Press Service<br /><br />\nit should be for th-2 sake of<br />\nstudents desiring involvement<br />\nin intersession). As witnessed<br />\nby this year's offerings, the present system is insufficient for<br />\nproviding interesting and useful<br />\nintersession courses. I don't<br />\nhave any specific proposal<br />\nmyself, but the plan suggested<br />\nby you in that issue of requiring new faculty to periodically<br />\nteach an intersession course on<br />\nsome type of rotation sounds<br />\npotentially effective.<br />\nWith regards to my second point, why not extend<br />\nChristmas break by a week?<br />\nThat way people could attend<br />\nintersession and still feel rested<br />\nand ready to get back into studying after their vacation.<br />\nThese two measures would effectively cure the third ailment<br />\nof intersession, as enrollment in<br />\nit would probably jump<br />\nsignificantly and being at<br />\nHopkins during Intersession<br />\nwould<br />\nno<br />\nlonger<br />\nbe<br />\nsynonymous with loneliness<br />\nand boredom.<br />\nBrook van Hamm Wiers<br /><br />\nTry Interaction<br />\nTo the Editor:<br /><br />\nTwo Pepsi Glasses with Pepsi<br />\nFor Free<br />\nWith Any Large or Medium Pizza<br /><br />\nItM\"NV))<br />\nS<br />\n11.1*<br />\nCHICA,GO PIZZERIA,<br /><br />\n:).<br />\n\u2022\u2014<br />\n;1$<br />\n:).<br />\n\u2022--<br /><br />\n.\u2014<br />\n;)S<br /><br />\nGood everyday<br />\nas long as offer lasts.<br /><br />\n;'5<br />\n\u2022-\u2022<br />\n;<br /><br />\n\u2022<br />\n;II<br /><br />\n151513155151MEMERI<br /><br />\n1.1.\"<br />\n\u2022 4\u202214\u20221001.0<br /><br />\nHFCX,No, MA.<br />\nIT WAS 3cEY.<br /><br />\n\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022 \u2022\u2022\u2022!\u202212'<br />\n.<br />\n1!..! \"Lr<br />\nI\u2022IP<br />\n\u2022:40.<br />\n;<br /><br />\ni;ra\"V EMMEN<br /><br />\nThis intersession I worked<br />\nwith a group of administrators<br />\non the Student-Faculty Interaction Program.

There<br />\nare few NBA-style lay-ups or<br />\nthundering slam dunks. This<br />\ndoes not mean the game lacks<br />\nexcitement. Just ask any<br />\nWashington College fan, willing to commit a large part of a<br />\nSaturday night to support their<br />\nteam. Perhaps Division III<br />\nbasketball is more human and<br />\ndown to earth than Division I,<br />\nwith solid shooting and defense<br />\nemphasized over potent<br />\nfastbreaks and flashy offenses.<br />\nYet both brands of basketball<br />\ncan provide spectators with enjoyment. Those few Hopkins<br />\nfans in attendance Saturday<br />\nnight can attest to that. I congratulate the Men's Basketball<br />\nteam on an outstanding win<br />\nand a solid performance all<br />\nseason long. It's a shame so few<br />\nHopkins supporters caught the<br />\nexcitement.<br />\nJeff Gordon<br /><br />\nNEWS-LETTER/11.<br /><br />\nFeatures<br />\nAkbar Brings Tandoori Cooking to Baltimore<br /><br />\nby Elizabeth Harrigan<br /><br />\nAkbar<br />\n823 N.

That is a difficult<br />\nquestion to answer, but the<br />\ndirectors of the Shriver Hall<br />\nConcert Series have managed to<br />\ndo just that.<br />\nThe Series' twentieth anniversary concert was given last<br />\nSaturday evening in Shriver<br />\nHall as a near capacity audience<br />\nlistened with greaty pleasure to<br />\nthe evening's featured performers, the internationally<br />\nrenowned Beaux Arts Trio.<br />\nThe trio, consisting of pianist<br />\nMenahem Pressler, violinist<br />\nIsidore Cohen, and cellist Bernard Greenhouse, has toured<br />\nextensively since its inception.<br />\nThe group performs regularly<br />\nat the Library of Congress, the<br />\nMetropolitan Museum of Art,<br />\nand at concert series of Harvard, Princeton, and Johns<br />\nHopkins Universities.<br /><br />\nThe Beaux Arts Trio, it.<br />\ncelebrating its thirtieth anniverThe Trio's playing of the<br />\nsary season this year, has made bright first movement with its<br />\nmany appearances in the past short, staccato motives and gidtwo decades of the Series ex- dy melodies revealed the polited<br />\nistence, and their performances perhaps precious theme of the<br />\nare always one of the season's piece.

The melodic opening<br />\nled into a lyrical extended playing of the theme which was<br />\nechoed both within the parts<br />\nand from the other musicians in<br />\nthe Trio. Their execution of the<br />\nthird movement was, in the<br />\nspirit of the piece, quite<br />\nfascinating.<br />\nThe final piece on the program was the \"Trio in E minor<br />\n(Dumky)\" of Anton Dvorak.<br />\nThe name \"dumky\" in the<br />\nalternate title means literally<br />\n\"little thought,\" or \"meditation.\" The work is not organized in the traditional sonata<br />\nform, but rather in a sequence<br />\nof six pieces. Solemn and<br />\nenergetic, the piece is a study of<br />\ncontrasting themes somber and<br />\nsullen with themes full of hope<br />\nand joy.<br />\nThroughout the performance<br />\nof this piece, each of the<br /><br />\nmembers of the Trio<br />\ndemonstrated his more than<br />\ncapable ability in playing the<br />\nsections. Notable in this piece<br />\nwere the pianissimo piano introduction to the second section<br />\nand the tuneful cello melody in<br />\nthe fourth.<br />\nFor encore pieces, the Beaux<br />\nTrio selected Mendelssohn's<br />\n\"Trio in D minor\" and the<br />\nFinale from the \"G major<br />\nTrio\" of Franz Joseph Haydn.<br />\nThese two pieces were definitely meant the display the talents<br />\nof the Trio members, and this<br />\nthey did, to the great enjoyment<br />\nof the audience.<br />\nThe brilliance and expertise<br />\nof the Beaux Arts Trio is indisputable.

Emmett<br />\nWalsh.<br />\nby Laurah Limbrick<br /><br />\nWildats is yet another entry<br />\nin the recently growing genre of<br />\nwhat has been termed the \"feelgood\" movie. Starring Goldie<br />\nHawn as Mollie McGrath, a<br />\ngirls' track coach at a \"nice\"<br />\nsuburban high school, Wildcats<br />\nis the story of how Mollie takes<br />\nthe dirtiest job of them all\u2014<br />\ncoaching varsity football at<br />\nCentral High, conveniently<br />\nlocated in the ghettos of<br />\nChicago\u2014and overcomes all<br />\nobstacles to make her team the<br />\ncity champs in one short<br />\nseason.<br />\nAs far as stereotypes go,<br />\nWildcats has them in abundance. There's the male<br />\nchauvinist pig, Dan, who's the<br />\nvarsity football coach at her<br />\nhigh school\u2014\"You know me,<br />\nBabes, I'm a modern guy\";<br />\nthere's the gay Home Ec<br />\nteacher who is chosen over<br />\nMollie to coach JV football at<br />\nher high school (Prescott); and<br />\nthere's Mollie herself, a divorced mother of two, proving that<br />\nshe is worthy of respect by taking<br />\non the job no one else<br />\nMoev<br />\nwould,<br />\nand \"earning\" the<br />\nDesire<br />\nDusk and<br />\nrespect of the team.<br />\nProfile Records<br />\nThe movie itself is full of<br />\nthese<br />\ncliches; Mollie espousing<br />\nMoev, a Canadian quartet,<br />\nthe<br />\n\"I<br />\nam free and liberated\"<br />\ncreates music that is best enrhetoric<br />\nto her ex-husband; the<br />\non<br />\njoyed in bits and pieces<br />\ntaking<br />\non<br />\nof the hopeless, obsystems.<br />\nA<br />\nsound<br />\ndance club<br />\nsingle dose of Moev's music can noxious team; and, of course,<br />\nwhat sports-oriented \"feelbe wonderful, but after a few of<br />\nDusk and Desire's ten songs good\" movie would be comhave played, the ingredients plete without the Big Game<br />\nagainst her former high school,<br />\nPrescott,<br />\nnow her arch rival,<br />\n14<br />\nPage<br />\nContinued on<br />\nwhere (guess who!) none other<br /><br />\nthan Dan, male chauvinist pig,<br />\nis the varsity football coach.<br />\nNot only that, but this game is<br />\nfor the city championship. And<br />\nso it goes.<br />\nFor once, however, Hawn is<br />\nnot cast as a bubble-headed<br />\nblonde; she gets to show that<br />\nshe knows football better than<br />\nanyone else. When her husband<br />\nthreatens to take away custody<br />\nof the children, under the<br />\npretext that her job as coach is<br />\nnot in the best interests of the<br />\nchildren, she eventually stands<br />\nup to him, instead of giving in<br />\nas she used to do. The experience of dealing with the<br />\nguys on the team seems to have<br />\ngiven her a strength that she<br />\ndidn't have before. There is<br />\nnothing really remarkable<br />\nabout Hawn's performance;<br />\nit's just something a little different from her previous roles.<br />\nSwoosie Kurtz is also pretty<br />\naverage in her role of Verna,<br />\nMollie's sister, although to be<br />\nhonest, there isn't a whole lot<br />\nthat could be done with her<br />\nrole. Verna serves largely as a<br />\nsupport for Mollie, when she<br />\nstarts to feel guilty because her<br />\nkids think she's ignoring them.<br />\nAn amusing minor character is<br />\nthe rather wooden stereotype of<br />\nthe ex-husband's new wife; the<br />\ncharacter of Stephanie is fun to<br />\nlaugh at because you know she<br />\nisn't quite real; she's exaggerated just a bit over the line.<br />\nAll in all, Wildcats will not<br />\nmake you think, and it has no<br />\ngreat messages. It might bring<br />\non a few laughs, but the problem is that you know from the<br />\nfirst five minutes on exactly<br />\nwhat the plot is. It's pretty<br />\nmuch an average film for the<br />\ngenre, and certainly not the<br />\nworst of the new releases. I'd<br />\nonly recommend it if you really have nothing better to do.<br /><br />\n14/FEBRUARY 21, 1986<br /><br />\nITZA HERE<br />\nITZA FRESH<br />\nITZA HOT<br />\nITZA FAST<br /><br />\nC<br /><br />\nA22A<br />\n3r<br />\n1/<br />\nAlso sandwiches and subs to go<br />\nCall your order in<br />\nBe ready for pick up within minutes<br />\n338-7972<br />\nJHU Snack Bar, AMR II<br />\n11AM-1AM<br /><br />\nSchlemmer's Odd Humanoids<br />\nby Claude loss\u00b0<br />\nThe first major exhibition of<br />\nOskar Schlemmer's work in the<br />\nUnited States opened at the<br />\nBaltimore Museum of Art on<br />\nSunday, February 9.

He<br />\nwas called to be the master of<br />\nsculpture, mural painting and<br />\nstage workshops at the<br />\nBauhaus, the famous hot-bed<br />\nof German art which thrived<br />\nbefore World War II. After<br />\n1933, his work was suppressed<br />\nby the Nazis and he had to take<br />\na menial job until his death in<br />\n1942. This suppression and<br />\nforced anonymity is a big<br />\nreason why his work is so unfamiliar to Americans.<br />\nSchlemmer's work spans<br />\nseveral periods, beginning in<br />\nthe early Cubist period (he contributed to an exhibit which included the works of Braque,<br />\nGleizes, Kandinsky, and others)<br />\nin 1911 to his last productions<br />\nduring the Second World War.<br />\nnever<br />\nart<br />\nSchlemmer's<br />\n\"matured\" into one style. His<br />\nwork is unified by a theme, not<br />\na style. Though a few of his early landscapes show a great<br />\nsimilarity to the Cubist efforts<br />\nof Braque and Picasso he soon<br />\nmoved away from that to concentrate on the human figure.<br />\nSchlemmer's works are<br />\npeculiar<br />\nby<br />\npopulated<br />\nhumanoid figures. They range<br />\nfrom figures which seem to be<br />\nmerely combinations of spheres<br />\nand cylinders to fully-developed<br />\nmannequin-like figures. Some<br />\nof his less-human figures may<br />\nhave one or two appendages<br />\nshaped nothing like an arm or<br />\na leg. One room in the exhibition contains figures with bats<br />\nor metal rings for arms and<br />\nwhere there should be legs,<br />\nthere is only what looks like<br />\nfunnel going into a point. On<br />\none wall, there are paintings of<br />\nthese figures and in front of<br />\nanother wall there are life-size<br />\nsculptures of the same figures.<br />\nThese oddly shaped and proportioned figures show Schlemmer's fascination with the way<br />\nthe body appears from one<br />\nposition to another, from a<br />\nstate of action to a state of rest.<br />\nAs a choreographer, he was<br />\nvery sensitive to these shifts. He<br /><br />\nrefines this fascination and<br />\ndevelops a theme when he pares<br />\ndown these unorthodox shapes<br />\ninto a uniform figure.<br />\nThere is a funny story behind<br />\nthe similar figures which<br />\npopulate most of Schlemmer's<br />\nwork. Schlemmer and several<br />\nfreinds all shaved their heads as<br />\na joke. Unfortunately for the<br />\nBauhaus master, his hair did<br />\nnot grow back. However,<br />\nSchlemmer used it to his advantage and, it seems, used his own<br />\nhead as the model for his<br />\nfigures. The figures in many of<br />\nhis paintings look very much<br />\nlike store-mannequins without<br />\nclothes or wigs. Schlemmer<br />\nstressed the similarities between<br />\nhumans as moving forms. The<br />\ndifferences or facial features<br />\nand gender are done away with<br />\nbecause Schlemmer's figures<br />\nhave no expressions or<br />\ngenitalia.<br />\nIt is not easy to reduce<br />\nShlemmer's work to some<br />\nmessage. Though he worked<br />\nduring a time of great social<br /><br />\nand political turmoil in Germany, Schlemmer didn't concentrate on political themes<br />\noften.<br />\nThe thing which attracted<br />\nthis writer most to Oskar<br />\nSchlemmer's art is the unique<br />\nway he portrays motion. As a<br />\nchoreographer, he had to be<br />\naware of how the human form<br />\nbends and twists in motion. In<br />\nhis paintings and his sculptuits,<br />\nhe captures figures at specific<br />\npoints in their action, so that<br />\nwhile each figure seems to be<br />\nvery much in motion, it also<br />\nseems to be perfectly still.<br />\nThis reporter may be totally<br />\nwrong in his interpretation of<br />\nOskar Schlemmer's art, but the<br />\nreader will never know until he<br />\ngoes to the museum to find out<br />\nfor himself.

Knopf, Inc.<br />\n$16.95. 312 pages.<br />\nby Andy Gray<br /><br />\n\"The bombs are real,\"<br />\nlaments the narrator of Tim<br />\nO'Brien's latest novel, The<br />\nNuclear Age. As one might imagine, this book is about growing up and living with the<br />\nspecter of nuclear war ever<br />\nthreatening in the not too dis,tant future, and how one man<br />\ncomes to grips with this brutal<br />\nreality. This is not a lighthearted book; The Nuclear Age<br />\nis a horror story, not in the<br />\ntraditional sense like the works<br />\nof Stephen King or H.P.<br />\nLovecraft, but in a way that<br />\nkeeps scaring the reader even<br />\nafter he closes the book. The<br />\nNuclear Age is about a world<br />\nthat exists, a world that is armed<br />\nto the teeth with nuclear<br />\nweapons, and if they are used,<br />\nsays O'Brien, there is absolutely<br />\nno way for you to protect<br />\nyourself.<br />\nThe plot is developed by<br />\nalternating chapters to the present and the past. The book<br />\nbegins, unusually enough, with<br />\nthe narrator getting out of bed<br />\nin the middle of the night to dig<br />\na bomb shelter. \"Am I crazy?\"<br />\nhe muses. The obvious answer<br />\nshould be yes, but the rest of<br />\nthe book appears to be an attempt to prove the narrator<br />\nsane.<br />\nTo give a chronological<br />\nhistory, the narrator, identified<br />\nas William, is developed from<br />\nchildhood. The reader is<br />\npresented with an extremely<br />\nprecocious and neurotic little<br />\nboy. William is preoccupied<br />\nwith his dreams about nuclear<br />\nwar; they are the worst of his<br /><br />\nchildhood nightmares, but with<br />\nthe cold, antiseptic sting of<br />\nplausability that no youth's<br />\nnightmare ever has. His dreams<br />\noften begin with the advent of<br />\nthe nuclear holocaust, followed<br />\nby flashes of red and yellow<br />\nlights. A bit cliched, but more<br />\nimaginative are his descriptions<br />\nof the results:<br />\nThe planet tilted. Kansas was<br />\nburning. Hot lava flowed<br />\ndown the streets of Chicago.<br />\nIt was all there, each detail:<br />\nManhattan sank into the sea,<br />\nNew Mexico flared up and<br />\nvanished. All across the<br />\ncountry, washing machines<br />\nkicked into their spin cycles,<br />\nradios blared, oceans bubbled, jets scrambled, vending<br />\nmachines emptied themselves, the Everglades went<br />\nbone dry. Marble churches<br />\nburned like kindling.<br />\nThe description continues,<br />\ngrowing more explicit and personal. The terror grows to be<br />\ntoo much for the young boy, so<br />\nhe decides to build a bomb<br />\nshelter. Of course it is quite<br />\ncrude, made out of a ping-pong<br />\ntable and odds and ends from<br />\nhis basement. It is a placebo,<br />\nand William feels secure in his<br />\nmakeshift shelter. And this is<br />\nthe main theme of the book,<br />\nthat the threat of nuclear war is<br />\nso great that one must always try<br />\nto find some sort of protection<br />\nfrom it. The sad truth,<br />\nhowever, is that any form of<br />\nprotection would be, at best, a<br />\ndelusion.<br />\nWilliam spends a fair<br />\namount of time convincing<br />\nhimself, and in turn the reader,<br />\nthat nuclear war is indeed a real<br />\npossibility. \"Go ahead, say the<br />\nwords,\" the narrator implores<br />\n\"nuclear<br />\nreader,<br />\nthe<br />\nwar.\"Say it out loud.\" In<br />\nsome way, verbalizing does give<br />\nmore validity to the concept of<br /><br />\nnuclear war. It doesn't<br />\ndrastically alter one's concept<br />\nof nuclear war, but it does give<br />\na person the opportunity to<br />\ncontemplate a reality that is<br />\notherwise lost in an introspective society. \"The Bombs are<br />\nreal,\" chides William.<br />\nThe book is extremely well<br />\nwritten. O'Brien has an easygoing, almost tender style of<br />\nwriting that eases the pages<br />\nalong. Further, the unique format of the book works well,<br />\ndeveloping the characters<br />\nthrough two story lines, with<br />\neach new chapter developing a<br />\nnew facet of William's personality, each facet being<br />\ncarefully rationalized. These rationalizations help William to<br />\nprove his sanity, despite his<br />\notherwise irrational behavior<br />\ndue to the possibility of nuclear<br />\nwar. They also provide<br />\ncredibility to the character for<br />\nthe reader, regardless of<br />\nwhether or not the reader<br />\nagrees with William's particular<br />\nviews and actions.<br />\nOddly enough, despite all the<br />\nwork on caricature through rationalization, William appears<br />\nsomewhat flat or one sided, but<br />\nthis may well be intended.<br />\nWilliam's most overwhelming<br />\nof<br />\nis one<br />\nimpression<br />\nhelplessness, that of a small<br />\npart in a massive international<br />\nsystem, having no real effect on<br />\nhis own destiny. It is a bizarre<br />\nanalogy; that we are all in many<br />\nways helpless should the international balance of power<br />\ndeteriorate to the actual use of<br />\nnuclear warheads.<br />\nIn sum, this book is worth<br />\nreading. It's well written and<br />\nquite captivating. While many<br />\nmay not agree with the way in<br />\nwhich nuclear war is dealt with<br />\nin this book, it is still very inthought<br />\nand<br />\nteresting<br />\nprovoking.<br /><br />\nKansas was burning.

Dixon and I talked in his office in<br />\nGilman.<br />\nI never thought of myself as<br />\na writer, you know, until I was<br />\ntwenty-three or four. I grew up<br />\nin New York. My father was a<br />\ndentist; my mother was an interior designer. I went to public<br />\nschools, public high schools,<br />\nand then city college, a public<br />\ncollege, thinking I would<br />\nbecome a newsman. I had two<br />\nolder brothers who were<br />\nnewsmen. I worked for NBC as<br />\na copyboy for a couple of years<br />\nand then graduated. I did very<br />\npoorly in all of my academic<br />\nwork, from public school<br />\nthrough college. I was never a<br />\nstudent. What happened after<br />\ncollege was that I worked as an<br />\nartists' model and had an<br /><br />\naborted lover affair and felt a painter. Also, by that time, I<br />\nvery sad and decided to take the was beginning to write plays.<br />\nthree, four hundred dollars I And then I got a job as a<br />\nhad and go to Mexico and newsman in an elevator in<br />\nWashington. I was in the<br />\npaint.<br />\npainter?<br />\nwith my brother, who<br />\na<br />\nelevator<br />\nonce<br />\nwere<br />\nSo you<br />\nWell. I thought of myself as was a newsman, and somebody<br />\n\u2022 ..\u2022<br />\n. .<br /><br />\nsaid, \"Will you work for News<br />\nAssociates for two weeks? We<br />\nneed somebody to fill in.\" I<br />\nstayed for two years. It was a<br />\ngood job and the best job, really, that I ever had in the sense<br />\nof how much I learned. And<br />\nhow much I found I could do<br />\nthat I never thought I could.<br />\nAnd while there, I started to<br />\nwrite seriously.<br />\nI was always a very good<br />\nreader and I would sit home<br />\nevery night after work. I made<br />\nfifty-five dollars a week, so I<br />\ndidn't have much money,<br />\ndidn't have a car or anything<br />\nlike that and would drink and<br />\nread. And that was the way I<br />\nspent the first three, four<br />\nmonths of my months as a<br />\nnewsman. Then I said I should<br />\ndo something else. Then I<br />\nremembered I'd once thought<br />\nabout writing. I'd written a<br />\ncouple of stories in college and,<br />\nso I started to write. That's<br />\nwhen I really got involved in<br />\nwriting . ..Since 1961, I've been<br />\nwriting fiction and from then<br />\non, I'd take a job, make<br />\nenough money to save and then<br />\nquit and from then on, I'd take<br /><br />\na job, make enough money to<br />\nsave and then quit and then<br />\nwrite. But I always wrote every<br />\nday. When the job was 8:30 to<br />\n3:00\u2014that was the schoolteacher<br />\njob I had in New York for<br />\nseven or eight years\u2014I'd get up<br />\nat 6:00 and work.<br />\nHow would you describe the<br />\ntype of story you write?<br />\nI'm very interested in writing<br />\npersonal stories.

I want my money<br />\nback.\" So they wrote a receipt<br />\nand he got his money back.<br />\nAbout the new kind of<br />\nmarketing: what do you think<br />\nof Andy Warhol's idea offifteen minutes of fame for<br />\neveryone, and all that.<br />\nI'm a pretty open, frank,<br />\nsociable person. I don't believe<br /><br />\nWhat about PEN?<br />\nI'm leaving PEN myself.<br />\nFirst of all, I feel any organization that would name Norman<br />\nMailer as President is not one<br />\nI want to belong to. I do feel<br />\nthat PEN is very often a group<br />\nthat is sort of directed toward<br />\neach individual in the upper<br />\nhierarchy. You know, doing<br />\nthings for themselves. It has<br />\ngood motives in getting writers<br />\nout of prison, but just that is<br />\nnot enough for me to want to<br />\njoin. I didn't feel good even<br />\njoining...I've only gone to two<br />\nPEN meetings. One was about<br />\ntranslators. I sat through it and<br />\nfound there was a lot of selfpromotion going on among<br />\neverybody there. The other one<br />\nwas when I was inducted. I<br />\nthought, \"Wow, I'm inducted<br />\ninto PEN.\" That was a big surprise, you know,somebody has<br />\nto nominate you. I thought, I'll<br />\nbe one of eight or nine inducted. I go there, there are<br />\naobut two hundred people being inducted at the same time.<br />\nThe induction meant giving you<br />\na slip that said,\"You are entitled to two free drinks.\" It was<br />\njust awful, an awful party, so<br />\nI left.<br />\nSome artists get togetherfor<br />\na common cause, like publicizing the arms race. What do you<br />\nthink of the politics involved in<br />\nwriter's groups?<br />\nI don't really like signing<br />\nanything. But if I felt my<br />\nsignature was something that<br />\ncould help somebody in some<br />\nbad situation, I'd probably<br />\nsign. . .In PEN, all the issues<br />\nseem to be diluted and almost<br />\nsecondary to the continuation<br />\nfor its members and for its<br />\nleaders. That's my gripe with<br />\nthem. My gripe with them was<br />\ninviting George Schultz, a nonwriter, to speak. But all that has<br />\nbeen in the news, said more articulately by other guys.<br />\nDo politicsfind their way in-<br /><br />\nto your writing?<br />\nNo, nothing like party<br />\nsides. . . Sort of universally<br />\npolitical. Many of my stories<br />\nare about victims. In Encountering Revolution, what<br />\ngave me that idea is my feeling<br />\ntoward victims. When I was<br />\nwriting that, I was probably<br />\nthinking of Nicaragua. You<br />\nhave a revolution and then you<br />\nhave the counter-revolution.<br />\nIt's always going to be bad for<br />\nthe normal person in the street,<br />\nthey're the victims. That's as<br />\nfar as my politics go, in my<br />\nwriting.<br />\nWhat do you think of your<br />\nwork's reception, by the public<br />\nand by the critics? What is your<br />\nplace among American writers?<br />\nI don't really think of it. I<br />\ndon't think of myself in any<br />\nparticular place regarding other<br />\nwriters. I don't want to feel<br />\ncompetitive. I think that's<br />\nsomething that would help<br />\ndestroy my writing...That<br />\ndoesn't have any use.<br />\nTo me, it's just a surprise\u2022<br />\nthat my work is published.<br />\nWhen each book is taken, I'm<br />\nvery grateful, thankful. I can't<br />\ndeny I wouldn't mind each<br />\nbook having a little better<br />\nreception than the others. But<br />\nthey've gotten good reviews,<br />\nthey've gotten bad reviews. But<br />\nthey have gotten a few intelligent critical appraisals in<br />\nbooks, in magazines. That's<br />\nokay. I don't mind bad reviews,<br />\nor the good reviews, if they're<br />\nintelligent reviews. So, you<br />\nknow, I've gotten awards, I've<br />\nreceived fellowships and I got<br />\nthis job, because of my<br />\nwriting...<br />\nI love to write. I don't want<br />\nto ruin it by thinking that I've<br />\nbeen cheated or anything. I feel<br />\nI've done well in writing. My<br />\nstories have been published, my<br />\nbookscI have a ninthCand the<br />\nrest of it.

The talk is not<br />\nabout the 10-14 record. Not<br />\nmentioned are the high expectations that were never realized.<br />\nNo, when the Men's Varsity<br />\nHoops team gathers for the<br />\ncelebration, the only thing<br />\nremembered will be the 83-79<br />\n.upset of nationally ranked<br />\nWashington College.<br />\nOf course, by the time the<br />\nreunion rolls around, the story<br />\nof \"The Win\" will have been<br />\ntold a hundred times over. And<br />\nof course, the truth will have<br />\nbeen stretched and yanked and<br />\npulled in every direction.<br />\nBy that time, Washington<br />\nCollege will have been the national champion with two seven<br />\nfooters. . .one of them a point<br />\nguard.<br />\nBut it doesn't really matter<br />\nanyway. The Blue Jay's upset<br />\nof the Shoremen was one of the<br />\nbiggest in Hopkins history; certainly the biggest in coach Nad<br />\nDoherty's era. And if you were<br />\nat home watching Dorothy and<br />\nToto, shame on ya, because<br />\nyou missed a thriller!<br />\nThe two teams went at each<br />\nother for forty minutes about<br />\nas hard as could be done. The<br />\nlead never stretched more than<br />\nnine points. Just as Washington<br />\nlooked as if it would pull away<br />\nlate, Mike Kowatch got a steal,<br /><br />\nSports Archives<br /><br />\nRalph (French) Horne blows past an opponent for one of the many baskets of his distinguished Hopkins<br />\ncareer. Horne hung up his shoes on a winning note last Saturday.<br /><br />\nHopkins trailed 78-73 with<br />\nChris Wasson hit a jumper and<br />\nthe Jays were back within four. 1:37 remaining before Kowatch<br />\nHopkins kicked and scratched picked off an errant pass due to<br />\nto stay in the game and then the Jays trapping defense.<br />\nwhen it came down to the Kowatch is fouled and hit both<br />\nstripe, 15 feet from the hoop, ends to pull the squad to within<br />\nthe Jays scored. Remarkably, three, at 78-75. Going for the<br />\neach team shot 69 shots and steal in the backcourt, Kevin<br />\neach team hit 30 of them. The Sottak, who came off the bench<br />\ndifference was the Jays hit 23 of with a great effort, put<br />\n30 foul shots. The Shoremen hit Washington back on the foul<br />\nline. His first shot was good,<br />\n19 of 29.<br /><br />\nbut the second bounced deep<br />\noff the rim, back to the<br />\nShoremen. But Wasson forced<br />\na steal that Charlie Sikorsky<br />\ngrabbed and hit Wasson for a<br />\nlayup, 79-77 with 1:14 left.<br />\nKowatch<br />\nthen<br />\nput<br />\nWashington back on the charity stripe with a foul in the<br />\nbackcourt. Dave Wilson rebounded the missed shot and<br />\nthe Jays had a chance to tie<br /><br />\nwith less than a minute left.<br />\nChris Wasson, who missed two<br />\njumpers not three minutes<br />\nbefore from the same spot,<br />\nswished a 20-footer from the<br />\ntop of the key.<br />\n\"With Chris, that is his<br />\nshot,\" said Doherty. \"That's<br />\nlike a layup for everyone else.\"<br />\nWasson's layup ties the game<br />\nfor the first time in ten minutes<br />\nat 79-79. Washington College<br />\nthen slows the ball down to run<br />\nof the final :42 for a last shot.<br />\nThe Shoremen shoot a jumper<br />\nthat missed but Washington's<br />\nTom Advil grabbed the rebound underneath. Terry Ryan<br />\ncommitted a good foul to stop<br />\nthe easy hoop and put Advil<br />\nand the foul line. Advil misses<br />\nbut again the Shoremen get the<br />\nbound. Instead of holding the<br />\nball again, Washington's Kurt<br />\nKeller, probably the best player<br />\nin the conference, forced a shot<br />\nand Kowatch grabbed the rebound and got fouled.<br />\nSo here is senior Mike<br />\nKowatch in his final game as a<br />\nBlue Jay with the score tied at<br />\n79-79 with :11 left standing at<br />\nthe foul line. These are the last<br />\ntwo shots Kowatch will shoot<br />\nfor Hopkins. Ladies and<br />\nGentlemen, this is pressure.<br />\n\"I knew I was going to hit<br />\nthem,\" said Kowatch. \"We<br />\ncame too far to lose it so I knew<br />\nthis one was meant to be.\"<br />\nKowatch hit nothing but net<br />\non both free throws and the<br />\nContinued on Page 22<br /><br />\nSeasoned Lady Jays Should Be Ripe For '87<br />\nby Christopher Szeles<br /><br />\nSwami Ramachandran<br /><br />\nDespite a Disapointing Season, Coach Kay Fowler Dressler feels her Lady<br />\nHoopsters will be experienced and stronger in the '86-'87 season.<br /><br />\nThe women's basketball<br />\nteam completed their gruelling<br />\nseason with an emotional win<br />\nover Goucher to raise their<br />\nrecord to a disappointing 2-18.<br />\nWith a little luck, Hopkins<br />\ncould have had improved their<br />\nmark to 6-14. The Jays lost 4<br />\ndecisions decided by 6 points or<br />\nless.

Harper<br />\nranked 19th nationally late in<br />\nthe season in scoring. She shot<br />\na scorching 44 percent from the<br /><br />\nfield.

She just missed<br />\nHopkins' single game and<br />\nseason marks for blocks. She<br />\nswatted away 9 shots against<br />\nHood, and all Hopkins' blocking record seem in jeopardy.<br />\nSpengler added a viable inside<br />\nscoring threat. She averaged 6.0<br />\npoints per game and had some<br />\noutstanding<br />\noffensive<br />\ncontributions.<br />\nSophomore guard Jeanne<br />\nClark had a fabulous season as<br />\nshe scored 8.5 points per game.<br />\nShe led the Jays in field goal<br />\npercentage with a sizzling 44<br />\npercent and shot well from the<br />\nline(66 percent). She was relied<br />\non heavily as their ball handler<br />\nand was able to contribute with<br />\nher good outside shooting.<br />\nCaptain Rachelle LaForce<br />\nadded 14.1 per game and led<br /><br />\nHopkins in free throws and free<br />\nthrow percentage (70 percent).<br />\nShe scored 36 points in<br />\nHopkins' final 2 efforts. Coach<br />\nDressler acknowledges, \"Her<br />\nconsistent outside shooting<br />\nmakes her very valuable in the<br />\noffensive attack.\"<br />\nSusie Stickney had a good<br />\nseason and collected an incredible 29 steals.

But I have some<br />\nquestions.<br />\nThe clock in women's collegiate basketball is 30 seconds.<br />\nThe clock in the NBA is 24. So<br />\nwhy is the men's clock 45<br />\nseconds? Why should it take<br />\nthem 15 seconds longer to move<br />\nthe ball downcourt than it takes<br />\nwomen?<br />\nI think the assets of the<br />\nclock, which will be in effect in<br />\nthe NCAA's Division I this<br />\nyear, are many.<br />\nFirst, there will be no more<br />\n\"bore\" games, no 19-12 or<br />\n13-11 stuff. Another asset is<br />\nthat the coaches will now<br />\nrecruit more small guards for<br />\noutside shooting. And that, in<br />\nreality, the game will be played<br />\nquicker only in the minds of the<br />\nplayers, while the actral scores<br />\nwill not increase.<br />\nNow for the liabilities. The<br />\nclock will help the schools with<br />\nthe best material. The rich will<br />\nget richer. Remember, all the<br />\nrules that have been instituted<br />\nin the last 10 years have been an<br />\nasset to the dynasties, and this<br />\nis no different.<br />\nAll teams will be playing<br />\npostage-stamp zones, especially at the tailend of the 45<br />\nseconds. What you're going to<br />\nsee, during each 45-second bite,<br />\nare multiple faces on the<br /><br />\npen in the future: The threepoint play will be put back in<br />\nas a counter-balance, and<br />\nbecause of this, they'll lower<br />\nthe men's clock to 30 seconds,<br />\nto be equal with the ladies. And<br />\neventually, there will be no<br />\nclock used during the last two<br />\nor three minutes of the game.<br />\nGiven all this, there will be<br />\nno possible way a patsy or<br />\nheavy underdog can beat a<br />\ntop-40 team. And what that<br />\nmeans is that each of our top-40<br />\nteams, the Miller American<br />\nguys who are perenially NCAAbound, will have a minimum of<br />\nseven automatic wins.<br />\nHey, I favor the clock. But<br />\nyou have to put the three-point<br />\nplay in because without it,<br />\ndefense.

Senior tricaptain Jules Shin followed<br />\nwith a pin at 126 to put<br />\nHopkins ahead 6-3.
