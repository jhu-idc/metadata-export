One was that<br />\nthe fees so collected are to be spent<br />\nunder the immediate direction of<br />\nthe Board of Collegiate Studies;<br />\nthe other was that the distribution<br />\nof the money is not limited in any<br />\nway to \"organized\" activities. Inasmuch as the Board of Collegiate<br />\nStudies has delegated to its Committee on Student Affairs all nonscholastic matters, I asked the members of the committee to meet with<br />\nme so as to discuss the situation.<br />\nImmediately after this I requested<br />\nthe members of the Student Activities Council to meet in my office so<br />\nthat I might let them know the<br />\nfacts. I also stated at this meeting<br />\nmy personal feeling in regard to the<br />\nactivities, and received from the<br />\nmembers of the council much valuable information. I was greatly<br />\npleased by their attitude and their<br />\nevident desire to cooperate for the<br />\nbest interests of the College. After<br />\nthis meeting I drew up a memorandum containing my suggestions to<br />\nthe Faculty Committee on Student<br />\nAffairs, with the request that they<br />\ndiscuss them and that, after adopting their own regulations, they<br />\nwould submit them to me so that I<br />\nmight put them into action.

One was that<br />\nthe fees so collected are to be spent<br />\nunder the immediate direction of<br />\nthe Board of Collegiate Studies;<br />\nthe other was that the distribution<br />\nof the money is not limited in any<br />\nway to \"organized\" activities. Inasmuch as the Board of Collegiate<br />\nStudies has delegated to its Committee on Student Affairs all nonscholastic matters, I asked the members of the committee to meet with<br />\nme so as to discuss the situation.<br />\nImmediately after this I requested<br />\nthe members of the Student Activities Council to meet in my office so<br />\nthat I might let them know the<br />\nfacts. I also stated at this meeting<br />\nmy personal feeling in regard to the<br />\nactivities, and received from the<br />\nmembers of the council much valuable information. I was greatly<br />\npleased by their attitude and their<br />\nevident desire to cooperate for the<br />\nbest interests of the College. After<br />\nthis meeting I drew up a memorandum containing my suggestions to<br />\nthe Faculty Committee on Student<br />\nAffairs, with the request that they<br />\ndiscuss them and that, after adopting their own regulations, they<br />\nwould submit them to me so that I<br />\nmight put them into action.
