Senior Speaks<br />\n<br />\nthe freshmen should be placed in a class<br />\nof their own, distinct from the sophomores, juniors, or seniors, we do not<br />\nknow. All members of all four undergraduate classes are in college for one<br />\npurpose\u2014to pursue studies which will<br />\nprepare them for life work. There are<br />\ndifferences in ages, intellectual maturity,<br />\nin years of residence, but no other. Those<br />\ndifferences, however, give no reason<br />\nfor looking upon the frosh as insignificant, or as in need of discipline which is<br />\nsupposed to insure a better foundation<br />\nfor future years in college. The firstyear student need not be brow-beaten into<br />\nrealizing that he is beginning a new<br />\nphase of life.<br />\nIt is absurd to believe that \"rat rules\"<br />\nwill discipline the new students. The<br />\nfreshmen realize that they must obey,<br />\nto a certain degree, the rules set down\u2014<br />\nor else. Everything they do\u2014if they do<br />\nthe things required of them\u2014is done because of the regulations imposed, not because the men feel they should adhere to<br />\nthe rules. Discipline? We wonder!<br />\nWhen the sophomore year rolls 'round<br />\nthe spirit of friendliness and good will<br />\nis in a bad state. There are no more<br />\nrules. Do the sophs continue their \"hellos\" to everyone on the campus? Do the<br />\nsophs attend the games en masse, full of<br />\ntrue spirit ? The obvious answer is a<br />\nhearty \"No!\"<br />\nFreshmen regulations are childish and<br />\nridiculous.

We made an insinuation in our<br />\neditorial of October 25 which, it has been<br />\ndefinitely shown, was unjust to Reid. The<br />\nSenior Class head acted as a gentleman<br />\nshould in regard to this editorial comment and we feel that we should act like<br />\ngentlemen and apologize for a very grave<br />\nerror.<br />\nReid is the ONE exception to our assertion: \"Not one man elected or nominated in the class elections this year has<br />\nearned the right to an office on the<br />\nground that a representative majority of<br />\nhis classmates regard him as the bestsuited man for the post.\" The Engineers<br />\nbacked Reid, a member of their own<br />\nschool at Homewood. But many seniors<br />\nin the College of Arts and Sciences voted<br />\nfor Reid, too. He was the choice of his<br />\nClass, as far as the votes show. He did<br />\nNOT campaign for votes and he did<br />\nNOT band together the Engineers. The<br />\nEngineers banded together themselves in<br />\norder to put over Reid.<br />\nIn making this public apology for making an unjust statement which included<br />\nReid's name, we do not retract our assertion that no other officer in the four<br />\nclasses earned the right to head the<br />\ngroups on the ground that they were the<br />\nactual choice of a representative majority<br />\nof his classmates.<br />\n<br />\nLETTER/<br />\nTo The<br />\n<br />\nEDITOP<br />\nContributions to this column are welcomed<br />\nfrom students, faculty, and alumni.

Senior Speaks<br /><br />\nthe freshmen should be placed in a class<br />\nof their own, distinct from the sophomores, juniors, or seniors, we do not<br />\nknow. All members of all four undergraduate classes are in college for one<br />\npurpose\u2014to pursue studies which will<br />\nprepare them for life work. There are<br />\ndifferences in ages, intellectual maturity,<br />\nin years of residence, but no other. Those<br />\ndifferences, however, give no reason<br />\nfor looking upon the frosh as insignificant, or as in need of discipline which is<br />\nsupposed to insure a better foundation<br />\nfor future years in college. The firstyear student need not be brow-beaten into<br />\nrealizing that he is beginning a new<br />\nphase of life.<br />\nIt is absurd to believe that \"rat rules\"<br />\nwill discipline the new students. The<br />\nfreshmen realize that they must obey,<br />\nto a certain degree, the rules set down\u2014<br />\nor else. Everything they do\u2014if they do<br />\nthe things required of them\u2014is done because of the regulations imposed, not because the men feel they should adhere to<br />\nthe rules. Discipline? We wonder!<br />\nWhen the sophomore year rolls 'round<br />\nthe spirit of friendliness and good will<br />\nis in a bad state. There are no more<br />\nrules. Do the sophs continue their \"hellos\" to everyone on the campus? Do the<br />\nsophs attend the games en masse, full of<br />\ntrue spirit ? The obvious answer is a<br />\nhearty \"No!\"<br />\nFreshmen regulations are childish and<br />\nridiculous. University of Maryland has<br />\nsunk to a state of puerility when it turns<br />\nto \"rat rules\" to instill into the campus<br />\na \"rah-rah\" spirit.<br /><br />\nApologies, Reid<br />\nWE owe William Reid, the newlyelected Senior Class president, a public<br />\napology. We made an insinuation in our<br />\neditorial of October 25 which, it has been<br />\ndefinitely shown, was unjust to Reid. The<br />\nSenior Class head acted as a gentleman<br />\nshould in regard to this editorial comment and we feel that we should act like<br />\ngentlemen and apologize for a very grave<br />\nerror.<br />\nReid is the ONE exception to our assertion: \"Not one man elected or nominated in the class elections this year has<br />\nearned the right to an office on the<br />\nground that a representative majority of<br />\nhis classmates regard him as the bestsuited man for the post.\" The Engineers<br />\nbacked Reid, a member of their own<br />\nschool at Homewood. But many seniors<br />\nin the College of Arts and Sciences voted<br />\nfor Reid, too. He was the choice of his<br />\nClass, as far as the votes show. He did<br />\nNOT campaign for votes and he did<br />\nNOT band together the Engineers. The<br />\nEngineers banded together themselves in<br />\norder to put over Reid.<br />\nIn making this public apology for making an unjust statement which included<br />\nReid's name, we do not retract our assertion that no other officer in the four<br />\nclasses earned the right to head the<br />\ngroups on the ground that they were the<br />\nactual choice of a representative majority<br />\nof his classmates.<br /><br />\nLETTER/<br />\nTo The<br /><br />\nEDITOP<br />\nContributions to this column are welcomed<br />\nfrom students, faculty, and alumni.
