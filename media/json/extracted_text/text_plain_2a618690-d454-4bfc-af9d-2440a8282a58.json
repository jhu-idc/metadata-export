Although the<br />\nUniversity has nearly erased the<br />\n$4.7 million deficit which existed<br />\nin 1970, Muller stated the<br />\nUniversity would find it<br />\nincreasingly difficult to secure<br />\nfinancial gifts if it were still<br />\noperating in the red by 1974.<br />\n\"People just aren't willing to<br />\npour money into a failing<br />\ninstitution,\" he said.<br />\nAccording to Muller, the<br />\nincrease is unavoidable owing to<br />\nseveral circumstances over which<br />\nthe University has no control.<br />\nParamount in this respect is the<br />\ncurrent inflationary spiral of the<br />\nAmerican economy, which<br />\nMuller stated \"even by<br />\nconservative estimate is running<br />\nat 3% per year.\" Subsequently,<br />\nthe University is being left with<br />\nan everincreasing payroll and<br />\nhigher costs for such necessities<br />\nas utilities and maintainance.<br />\nIn addition the University is<br />\nfaced with the sizeable costs of<br />\nconversion into a co-educational<br />\ninstitution. Among the needed<br />\n<br />\ninnovations, he listed: expanded<br />\nwomen's phys. ed. program,<br />\nconverting the dormitories into<br />\nsuitable women's residences, and<br />\nOb-Gyn services.<br />\nThe President also stated that<br />\nfunds were despararely needed<br />\nfor the ,MSE library which he<br />\ntermed as \"financially starved to<br />\ndeath\" in the current budget<br />\nsqueeze, and for renovation of<br />\nexisting biology laboratories.<br />\n<br />\nIn acknowledging that the<br />\nincrease would fall heavily on a<br />\nlarge segment of the studnet<br />\npopulation, the President said he<br />\nplanned to raise student aid<br />\nfunds by \"not less that 15%.\"<br />\nThis would be approximately<br />\n70-100,000 dollars. In response<br />\nto the idea of raising enrollment<br />\nas a means of increasing revenue,<br />\nthe president replied: \"That<br />\nwould be intolerable.\"<br />\n<br />\nHe added, \"The University<br />\ncould say we'll only give support<br />\nto thoses students we need for<br />\nteaching, but that wouldn't make<br />\nthe picture much better.\"<br />\nCurrently, the chemistry<br />\ndepartment has 80 graduate<br />\nstudents and 66 have teaching<br />\nassignments. But Biology, with<br />\n100 grads, only assigned 20 to<br />\nteach this semester. Humanitites<br />\ndepartments have fewer teaching<br />\njobs.<br />\nAnother factor pointed out be<br />\nBenton is the tradition, which<br />\ngrew up during the days of high<br />\nfederal support for graduate<br />\neducation, that graduate students<br />\nhave their tuition paid by<br />\nfellowship and living expenses by<br />\nstipend. If Hopkins were merely<br />\nto stop granting this kind of aid,<br />\ngraduate students would go<br />\nelsewhere. \"The way graduate<br />\nstudents get aid is a tradition,\"<br />\nBenton commented, \"and<br />\ntraditions take a long time to<br />\nchange.\"<br />\nStudent leaders however,<br />\nappear to be unwilling to wait.<br />\nStudent Council President Andy<br />\nSavitz has proposed that Hopkins<br />\nguarantee a student his tuition<br />\nwhen he enters, and not ask him<br />\nto pay any increase during his<br />\nfour years. Savitz also proposed<br />\nthat every time tuition is raised,<br />\nthe student activities budget be<br />\ndoubled.

Dr. Mandelbaum noted<br />\nthat there has been a<br />\nconcomitant improvement in<br />\ncampus life. He feels this has<br />\nbeen due to the reduction of<br />\nBaltimore residents in the<br />\nstudent, thus cutting down on<br />\nthe commuting that drains<br />\ninterest in campus affairs.<br />\nAs well, recent years have seen<br />\nthe construction of the athletic<br />\ncenter, the acceptance of Dr.<br />\nChester Wickwire's courses of<br />\nsocial relevance, the institution<br />\nof a number of lecture series and<br />\nat least the blueprint for a<br />\nStudent Union.<br />\nHis main criticism of the<br />\nUniversity is one held among<br />\nmany members of the Hopkins<br />\ncommunity. \"There are just not<br />\nenough people in the Humanities<br />\nand Social Sciences,\" he<br />\nremarked. He added, \"This has<br />\nalways been the case.\u2014<br />\nMandelbaum said he is confident<br />\nthat the faculty can do more<br />\nthan they have in the past to<br />\n<br />\nrecruit capable students in the.<br />\nnon-scientific fields. At other<br />\nschools this duty is often<br />\ndelegated to the junior faculty<br />\nmembers who traverse the<br />\ncountry informing and becoming<br />\nacquainted with prospective<br />\nstudents. He emphasized that<br />\nHopkins now has a faculty<br />\nadmissions committee which<br />\nparticipates in the freshman<br />\nselection process.<br />\nThe philosophy professor is<br />\nwell qualified to make<br />\ncomparisons between different<br />\nhigher educational systems<br />\nthough he judiciously refrains<br />\nfrom doing so since many of the<br />\n.campuses he is familiar with have<br />\nchanged radically in the past few<br />\nyears.<br />\nAfter receiving his B.A. from<br />\nDartmouth, he did graduate work<br />\nat Harvard and Berlin and<br />\nreceived his PhD. from Yale. He<br />\nthen taught at Swarthmore for<br />\nthirteen years, Dartmouth for ten<br />\nyears, and now Hopkins for<br />\nfourteen years. He has also held<br />\nvisiting professorships at the<br />\nUniversity of Michigan and<br />\nHarvard, during this period.<br />\nThe freedom in program<br />\ndesign that Hopkins offers its<br />\nprofessors is in Mandelbaum's<br />\neyes one of the University's<br />\ngreatest assets when compared to<br />\nother schools.<br />\nMandelbaum, who enjoys<br />\nliving in Baltimore, noted, \"The<br />\nrelationship of the faculty and<br />\n<br />\n\"The scope offaculty friendships extends far beyond the bounds of the University.\"<br />\ncommunity is quite different since its social life \"revolves member of the National Board<br />\nfrom other schools in other about the traditional tightly knit on Graduate Education.

No student<br />\nwaited in line more than five minutes.<br />\nThe reason given for this by University<br />\nofficials was the unexpected absence of<br />\nroughly 85% of the expected student<br />\npopulation. Several letters to President<br />\nSteven<br />\nMuller seem to indicate that<br />\nthis larger than usual \"no-show\" rate, as<br />\nit is called, is due to the $300 tuition<br />\nhike, approved without dissent last<br />\nOctober by the Board of Trustees while<br />\ntaking in the sights of historic<br />\nWilliamsburg, Virginia.

Many,<br />\nhowever, said that they had to sell their<br />\ncars in order to pay the higher tuition<br />\ncosts, and thus have no parking problems<br />\nanyway.<br />\nAn interview with Director of Housing,<br />\nPeter Heist, revealed similar findings.<br />\nHeist asserted, \"The fact that over 85%<br />\nof those living in University housing last<br />\nyear said that they could not afford it<br />\n<br />\nthis year meant that we were able to<br />\ndump our emergency plans of buying up<br />\nthe Greenway pharmacy and Eddie's<br />\nsupermarket and converting them into<br />\nstudent co-ops. In fact we have surplus<br />\nhousing and may lease it back to some of<br />\nthe senior citizens who used to live there<br />\nin the first place.\" Heist added that he<br />\nhas heard far fewer complaints about<br />\nexcess noise so far this year.<br />\nAnother side benefit is a noticeable<br />\nreduction in the size of lines in the Book<br />\nCenter and especially the bank in Gilman<br />\nFlail. When asked how he was able to<br />\nimprove service at the bank so markedly<br />\nin such a short time, the manager stated,<br />\n\"Well, we do have fewer new accounts<br />\nthis year. Also, most of our old returning<br />\ncustomers tell us they have less money,<br />\nanyway.\"<br />\nDespite all this optimism, there are a<br />\nfew gloomy drawbacks.

I understand how students' budgets<br />\nare tighter this year, but I did expect a<br />\nbit more enthusiasm.<br />\n\"It's more than a building, it's an<br />\nidea,\" Sydnor added.<br />\nMany find it hard to dig up enough<br />\npeople for a touch-football game.

The<br />\n\"full dress rehearsal\" I expected<br />\nhappened to be an agonizing technical<br />\nrehearsal preceeded by production pics<br />\nand plagued by technical difficulties,<br />\nmisuses and .the like. Twenty minute<br />\nplays stretched into grinding two hour<br />\nordeals. Impatient actors and directors<br />\nfidgeted about in the dressing rooms<br />\n<br />\nbelow the stage, waiting for their turn in<br />\nthe spotlight.<br />\nWatching from the shadows of Shriver,<br />\nI began to feel as if the performances<br />\nwere being given off stage. Three weeks<br />\nof previous rehearsals had seemingly<br />\nproduced a troupe of self-righteous,<br />\nego-inflated Hoppies bent on out-acting<br />\neach other.<br />\nI began to discern stereotypes<br />\nassociated with the theater: the sensitive<br />\nand arrogant director, unmercifully<br />\nbarking out stage directives to his actors,<br />\nthe strict but sympathetic producer.<br />\nsitting upon a chairback, sucking a pen<br />\nand gazing at the stage. the frustrated<br />\nactor who couldn't remember his lines<br />\nand the list could go on and on.<br />\nThe off-stage occurances rivaled the<br />\nproductions in terms of interest. One<br />\nproducer wandered around munching on<br />\na bag of Granola while an army-fatigued<br />\nactor, complete with a canteen full of<br />\nKool-Aid, did a respectable imitation of<br />\nRichard M.

It was not<br />\nso long ago that Hopkins rejected a substantial grant<br />\nfrom the ACTION agency which would have allowed a<br />\nlimited number of undergraduates to work in the community while receiving academic credit for a semester.<br />\nThe ACTION grant was turned down by the Academic Council on the grounds that the federal government imposed too many requirements in connection<br />\nwith the grant. In the case of the Labor Department<br />\nfunds, Hopkins lost the grant because the University<br />\nrequested an additional 57 percent of the grant over<br />\nthe initial amount to cover \"overhead costs.\"<br />\nHowever, as is the situation with most issues<br />\nconcerning community involvement, these grants will<br />\nnot be missed by many people for very long. They<br />\nwill, instead, go down in the records as two more<br />\nneglected opportunities that Hopkins had to involve<br />\nitself in the community which, for the most part, it<br />\nwould prefer to ignore. The University very conviently<br />\nblew the Labor funds by tacking on an exorbitant<br />\nrequest for more money. If Hopkins continues this<br />\npolicy of driving away federal funding for community<br />\naction programs it will soon find itself completelycut<br />\noff from the cummunity of which it should be a part.<br />\n<br />\nChess enraptures these floppies<br />\nsomeone play chess is like reading your<br />\nplayer must expend more effort to reach<br />\nfavorite pornography; it has its moments,<br />\na plateau of excellence than one would in<br />\nbut quickly dulls the mind.

The<br />\nColts great wide receiver warmed<br />\nup before last Sunday's triumph<br />\nover Buffalo, but was again<br />\nunable to perform.<br />\nIt came as a surprise to some<br />\nwhen the Colts tabbed Hinton as<br />\ntheir number one draft pick in<br />\n1969. After all, the Colts already<br />\nboasted a receiving unit of Willie<br />\nRichardson, Orr, and Ray<br />\nPerkins. Why draft another<br />\npotential receiver? The answer<br />\n<br />\ncame soon enough.<br />\nOrr retired and Richardson<br />\nwas shipped off to Pittsburgh in<br />\nexchange for Roy Jefferson. A<br />\nyear later Jefferson was gone,<br />\nand now Perkins has retired.<br />\nHinton became the Colts'<br />\npremiere pass catcher after only a<br />\nyear on the bench.<br />\n\"I observed from the sidelines,<br />\nbut there was just so much I<br />\ncould learn,\" Hinton explained.<br />\n\"With playing experience, you<br />\ncan learn from your mistakes.\"<br />\nNor did the Oklahoma<br />\n<br />\nAll-American disappoint anyone.<br />\nIn 1970, he finished second in<br />\nthe A.F.C. in pass receiving with<br />\n47 catches for 733 yards and five<br />\ntouchdowns. Last year he led the<br />\nclub with an unbelievable 21.5<br />\nyards per catch, hauling in 25<br />\npasses for 536 yards. His biggest<br />\ngame came in 1970 when he<br />\ndevastated the Kansas City<br />\ndefense for 11 receptions<br />\ncovering 190 yards.<br />\nHinton's college career was<br />\neven more amazing considering<br />\nthe fact that he started out as a<br />\n<br />\nrunning back before coming on<br />\nhis senior year to set a<br />\nconference record of 60 catches<br />\nfor 967 yards and six<br />\ntouchdowns. This was an<br />\nincredible feat for a club that<br />\nattempted fewer passes than any<br />\nother Big Eight team.<br />\n\"I had to make a big<br />\nadjustment from college to pro<br />\nball,\" Hinton replied when asked<br />\nabout the basic difference<br />\nbetween the two levels.<br />\n\"In college, the emphasis is on<br />\nspeed, while in pro ball the need<br />\n<br />\nF&M game A multitude of offensive mistakes<br />\nMomentum, or the lack of it,<br />\nand mistakes were the downfall<br />\nof the Blue Jay football team last<br />\nSaturday in their home opener at<br />\nHomewood Field, as Hopkins<br />\ndropped a 14-10 decision to the<br />\nDiplomats of Franklin &<br />\nMarshall.

As a result, the<br />\nentire Hopkins team gained only<br />\n23 net yards on the ground. The<br />\nDiplomats didn't do much better<br />\ngaining a total of 68 yards<br />\nrushing.<br />\nBut the story of the game was<br />\nthe inability of the Blue Jays to<br />\nscore on a sustained drive.

Standing five feet<br />\nseven inches tall and weighing<br />\nonly 155 pounds, he is easily<br />\nmistaken for an ordinary college<br />\nstudent. Yet, as unimpressive as<br />\nBilly may seem, he is still an<br />\nimposing figure on the gridiron.<br />\nHead Coach Dennis Cox<br />\nutilizes Billy as a wide receiver on<br />\noffense and a cornerback on<br />\ndefense. His quickness and<br />\nknowledge of football make up<br />\nfor any lack of size he might<br />\npossess.<br />\nNolan's explosiveness and<br />\nquick starts also make him a<br />\nvaluable kickoff and punt return<br />\nman. In both games this season<br />\nhe has broken punt returns, one<br />\nfor a touchdown and one for a<br />\nlong gain that led to a<br />\ntouchdown.<br />\nIn the 14-10 loss to F&M,<br />\nBilly ran back a 52 yard return to<br />\nthe Diplomat 11. Yet his<br />\ncompetitive spirit was not<br />\nsatisfied. He felt that he should<br />\nhave gone all the way.. \"I cut<br />\ninside and got tripped up. If I<br />\nhad gone outside, I would have<br />\nscored.\"<br />\nNolan's interception in the<br />\nclosing minutes of the first half<br />\nalso could have changed the<br />\noutcome of the game if not for<br />\noffsetting penalties.

He,felt that if they had<br />\nbeen able to eliminate the<br />\npenalties and other blatant<br />\nmistakes, the game would have<br />\nturned out better for the Blue<br />\nJays.

The Hopkins midfield<br />\nsquad did likewise, turning Blue<br />\nHen defensive clears into Blue<br />\nJay offensive plays, tripling the<br />\namount of shots on goal allowed<br />\nby Delaware in two previous<br />\ngames.<br />\nAs in the past two games, in<br />\nwhich the opponents got the first<br />\ngoal, Delaware's Jeff McBrearty<br />\nput in the first after twenty-five<br />\nand a half minutes had gone by<br />\nin the first half of the game.<br />\nHopkins' goalie, Keith<br />\nNaunheim, blocked a cross from<br />\nthe left side of the field by Chip<br />\nSmallwood but didn't quite tip<br />\nthe ball high enough to go over<br />\nthe crossbar.

This was the first<br />\ngoal for Rutkowski in a Blue Jay<br />\nuniform.<br />\n<br />\nTen minutes later, McBrearty<br />\nput in his second goal, the team's<br />\nthird, through the hands of<br />\nHopkins' freshman goalie Jack<br />\nBukowski. But the Blue Jays<br />\nrefused to give up.<br />\nAfter a series of offensive<br />\nthrusts by the Hopkins team,<br />\nsophomore Charlie Gilman sent a<br />\nrebound from a free kick to the<br />\nawaiting foot of Robert Arguero<br />\nwho placed the ball to the far<br />\npost away from the Delaware<br />\ngoalie.

In his freshman year,<br />\nhowever, Russ changed his mind:<br />\n\"I thought it would help my<br />\nspring track performance if I ran<br />\ncross-country,\" he recalls, and<br />\nthe soccer team's loss became the<br />\nharriers' gain.<br />\nSo far, Russ is delighted that<br />\nhe made the switch, and is very<br />\ncontent with the Hopkins<br />\nprogram. \"I like the level of<br />\ncompetition here,\" he says,\"and<br />\nsince I'm definitely not the best<br />\nin the league, there's still<br />\nsomething to work for.\"<br />\nDubiel reserves his highest<br />\npraise for Coach Don Masken,<br />\nwhom he calls \"the best coach<br />\nI've ever had.\" His chief asset,<br />\naccording to Russ, is his<br />\nflexibility -- his knack of<br />\nhandling different runners in<br />\nvaried ways. \"A guy at Hopkins<br />\nis here primarily for an<br />\neducation,\" Russ maintains,<br />\n\"Running is secondary. This<br />\nmakes it hard on their leader, but<br />\nCoach Masken recognizes it and<br />\nmodifies his policies to suit his<br />\n<br />\nrunners. He is more interested in<br />\nmolding a team than developing a<br />\nsuperstar.\"<br />\nThe average cross-country<br />\ncourse spans about five miles, but<br />\nDubiel might prefer it to be a bit<br />\nlonger. He admits to feeling<br />\n\"better\" after running a slightly<br />\nlonger distance, and does not feel<br />\nthat an extended course would<br />\nlessen his effectiveness.<br />\nThe first five finishers on each<br />\nteam count in the scoring in a<br />\ncross-country meet, but if one<br />\nteam finishes first, second, and<br />\nthird they win automatically,<br />\nregardless of the times of their<br />\nnext two finishers. It is Russ'job<br />\nto make sure that such a sweep<br />\ndoesn't occur, and to keep pace<br />\nwith the opposition's number<br />\none man. \"I really don't worry<br />\nabout my time,\" he asserts. \"I'm<br />\nout to help the team.\"<br />\nDubiel prefers to begin a race<br />\nquickly, so that he can \"start in<br />\nfront and stay in front,\" and<br />\nlikes to know that \"there's<br />\nnobody for me to catch.\" This<br />\nsaves one of his teammates from<br />\nhaving to set the pace for him -- a<br />\ntactic many longdistance runners<br />\nrequire -- since Russ is his own<br />\n\"rabbit.\"<br />\nWhen he's not running or<br />\nstudying, Russ finds time to be<br />\nco-director of \"Chester's Place\"<br />\n(the Friday night social center of<br />\nJHU) and troop coordinator of<br />\n<br />\nthe Outing Club. \"Since I'm<br />\ncoordinator,\" he laughs, \"I can<br />\nschedule the trips around my<br />\nmeets.\"<br />\nThe success that he's enjoyed<br />\nthus far has not made Russ<br />\ncomplacent, but he remains<br />\nextremely confident of his<br />\nability. \"So far no one's passed<br />\nme at the end of a race,\" he is<br />\nquick to point out, and if Russ<br />\nDubiel and Coach Masken have<br />\ntheir way, no one will for quite<br />\nsome time.<br />\n<br />\nYesterday afternoon, Athletic<br />\nDirector Marshall S.

Although the<br />\nUniversity has nearly erased the<br />\n$4.7 million deficit which existed<br />\nin 1970, Muller stated the<br />\nUniversity would find it<br />\nincreasingly difficult to secure<br />\nfinancial gifts if it were still<br />\noperating in the red by 1974.<br />\n\"People just aren't willing to<br />\npour money into a failing<br />\ninstitution,\" he said.<br />\nAccording to Muller, the<br />\nincrease is unavoidable owing to<br />\nseveral circumstances over which<br />\nthe University has no control.<br />\nParamount in this respect is the<br />\ncurrent inflationary spiral of the<br />\nAmerican economy, which<br />\nMuller stated \"even by<br />\nconservative estimate is running<br />\nat 3% per year.\" Subsequently,<br />\nthe University is being left with<br />\nan everincreasing payroll and<br />\nhigher costs for such necessities<br />\nas utilities and maintainance.<br />\nIn addition the University is<br />\nfaced with the sizeable costs of<br />\nconversion into a co-educational<br />\ninstitution. Among the needed<br /><br />\ninnovations, he listed: expanded<br />\nwomen's phys. ed. program,<br />\nconverting the dormitories into<br />\nsuitable women's residences, and<br />\nOb-Gyn services.<br />\nThe President also stated that<br />\nfunds were despararely needed<br />\nfor the ,MSE library which he<br />\ntermed as \"financially starved to<br />\ndeath\" in the current budget<br />\nsqueeze, and for renovation of<br />\nexisting biology laboratories.<br /><br />\nIn acknowledging that the<br />\nincrease would fall heavily on a<br />\nlarge segment of the studnet<br />\npopulation, the President said he<br />\nplanned to raise student aid<br />\nfunds by \"not less that 15%.\"<br />\nThis would be approximately<br />\n70-100,000 dollars. In response<br />\nto the idea of raising enrollment<br />\nas a means of increasing revenue,<br />\nthe president replied: \"That<br />\nwould be intolerable.\"<br /><br />\nHe added, \"The University<br />\ncould say we'll only give support<br />\nto thoses students we need for<br />\nteaching, but that wouldn't make<br />\nthe picture much better.\"<br />\nCurrently, the chemistry<br />\ndepartment has 80 graduate<br />\nstudents and 66 have teaching<br />\nassignments. But Biology, with<br />\n100 grads, only assigned 20 to<br />\nteach this semester. Humanitites<br />\ndepartments have fewer teaching<br />\njobs.<br />\nAnother factor pointed out be<br />\nBenton is the tradition, which<br />\ngrew up during the days of high<br />\nfederal support for graduate<br />\neducation, that graduate students<br />\nhave their tuition paid by<br />\nfellowship and living expenses by<br />\nstipend. If Hopkins were merely<br />\nto stop granting this kind of aid,<br />\ngraduate students would go<br />\nelsewhere. \"The way graduate<br />\nstudents get aid is a tradition,\"<br />\nBenton commented, \"and<br />\ntraditions take a long time to<br />\nchange.\"<br />\nStudent leaders however,<br />\nappear to be unwilling to wait.<br />\nStudent Council President Andy<br />\nSavitz has proposed that Hopkins<br />\nguarantee a student his tuition<br />\nwhen he enters, and not ask him<br />\nto pay any increase during his<br />\nfour years. Savitz also proposed<br />\nthat every time tuition is raised,<br />\nthe student activities budget be<br />\ndoubled. Now at $55,000, it was<br />\n$70,000 two years ago, when<br />\ntuition was only $2500.

Dr. Mandelbaum noted<br />\nthat there has been a<br />\nconcomitant improvement in<br />\ncampus life. He feels this has<br />\nbeen due to the reduction of<br />\nBaltimore residents in the<br />\nstudent, thus cutting down on<br />\nthe commuting that drains<br />\ninterest in campus affairs.<br />\nAs well, recent years have seen<br />\nthe construction of the athletic<br />\ncenter, the acceptance of Dr.<br />\nChester Wickwire's courses of<br />\nsocial relevance, the institution<br />\nof a number of lecture series and<br />\nat least the blueprint for a<br />\nStudent Union.<br />\nHis main criticism of the<br />\nUniversity is one held among<br />\nmany members of the Hopkins<br />\ncommunity. \"There are just not<br />\nenough people in the Humanities<br />\nand Social Sciences,\" he<br />\nremarked. He added, \"This has<br />\nalways been the case.\u2014<br />\nMandelbaum said he is confident<br />\nthat the faculty can do more<br />\nthan they have in the past to<br /><br />\nrecruit capable students in the.<br />\nnon-scientific fields. At other<br />\nschools this duty is often<br />\ndelegated to the junior faculty<br />\nmembers who traverse the<br />\ncountry informing and becoming<br />\nacquainted with prospective<br />\nstudents. He emphasized that<br />\nHopkins now has a faculty<br />\nadmissions committee which<br />\nparticipates in the freshman<br />\nselection process.<br />\nThe philosophy professor is<br />\nwell qualified to make<br />\ncomparisons between different<br />\nhigher educational systems<br />\nthough he judiciously refrains<br />\nfrom doing so since many of the<br />\n.campuses he is familiar with have<br />\nchanged radically in the past few<br />\nyears.<br />\nAfter receiving his B.A. from<br />\nDartmouth, he did graduate work<br />\nat Harvard and Berlin and<br />\nreceived his PhD. from Yale. He<br />\nthen taught at Swarthmore for<br />\nthirteen years, Dartmouth for ten<br />\nyears, and now Hopkins for<br />\nfourteen years. He has also held<br />\nvisiting professorships at the<br />\nUniversity of Michigan and<br />\nHarvard, during this period.<br />\nThe freedom in program<br />\ndesign that Hopkins offers its<br />\nprofessors is in Mandelbaum's<br />\neyes one of the University's<br />\ngreatest assets when compared to<br />\nother schools.<br />\nMandelbaum, who enjoys<br />\nliving in Baltimore, noted, \"The<br />\nrelationship of the faculty and<br /><br />\n\"The scope offaculty friendships extends far beyond the bounds of the University.\"<br />\ncommunity is quite different since its social life \"revolves member of the National Board<br />\nfrom other schools in other about the traditional tightly knit on Graduate Education. He<br />\ncities.\" He continued, \"We are family.\"<br />\nsummarized, \"My hobby is<br />\nFree Time<br />\nmuch more a part of the city.<br />\nwork.\"<br />\nThe scope of faculty friendships.<br />\nMost of Mandelbaum's free<br />\nMost certainly though,'<br />\nextends far beyond the bounds time is spent in outside<br />\nMandelbaum is accessible to<br />\nof the University.\" He also administrative work.

There is a good<br />\ndeal of misinformation we'd like<br />\nto correct.\" To this end, the<br />\nYoung Voters for the President<br />\nhas set up an information booth<br />\nat various locations on the<br />\ncampus and has established a<br />\nnewsletter providing interested<br />\nstudents with information on the<br />\nNixon re-election effort.<br />\nPut The Heat On<br />\nCanvass results of half of the<br />\ndorms and most of Wolman Hall<br />\nshowed 44 percent of the<br />\nstudents supporting Senator<br />\nMcGovern, thirty-one percent for<br />\nNixon, and twenty-five percent<br />\nundecided.

Waldrop is also busy<br />\nplanning a \"large social event\" - a<br />\nvictory celebration - for<br />\nsometime in November.<br />\nMichaels noted, \"This election<br />\nprovides an interesting challenge<br />\nbecause on one side we could be<br />\napathetic but on the other side<br />\nwe are excited by the prospect of<br />\nhow great the Nixon margin of<br />\nvictory can be.\" She stressed,<br />\n\"I'd like to see a Nixon majority<br />\non campus.\"<br /><br />\nDorms vote 24 hour parietal rules<br />\nThe Alumni Memorial<br />\nResidences all have twenty-four<br />\nhour parietals as decided by a<br />\nvote last week.<br />\nThe huge vote for unlimited<br />\nvisitation in the make residences<br />\nwas expected.

If pests are confined to<br />\na flat, its tenants are responsible<br />\nfor killing the bugs. In fact, the<br />\nhousing code considers dirty<br />\ndishes and dirty stoves as<br />\nviolations.

No student<br />\nwaited in line more than five minutes.<br />\nThe reason given for this by University<br />\nofficials was the unexpected absence of<br />\nroughly 85% of the expected student<br />\npopulation. Several letters to President<br />\nSteven<br />\nMuller seem to indicate that<br />\nthis larger than usual \"no-show\" rate, as<br />\nit is called, is due to the $300 tuition<br />\nhike, approved without dissent last<br />\nOctober by the Board of Trustees while<br />\ntaking in the sights of historic<br />\nWilliamsburg, Virginia. One typical letter<br />\nfrom a sophomore from Long Island<br />\nstated, \"With $300 this year, and no end<br />\nin sight, I'm getting out while the<br />\ngetting's good.\" Other letters were along<br />\nlines.<br />\n\"Of coui:,se,\" Dr. Muller insisted, \"we<br />\nKra,Le<br />\n\u2022<br /><br />\nsimilar<br /><br />\nvt- lust Minute t Tansie IS.

In fact, we anticipate several<br />\nbeneficial results to come of it\"<br />\n\u2022<br />\nSpeaking at the annual Evergreen<br />\nHouse retreat with student leaders,<br />\nMuller added, \"You haven't lost a<br />\nUniversity; the Hospital has gained a<br />\npresident.\"<br />\nThe benefits Muller was referring to<br />\ninclude the much-requested reduction in<br />\nclass size which Dr. Sigmund Suskind,<br />\nDean of Academic Programs, has<br />\npredicted for this year. \"We hope,\" one<br />\ndepartment chairman explained, \"this<br />\nwill precipitate greater contact than ever<br />\nbefore between faculty and students.\"<br />\nThe \"no-show\" syndrome having hit<br />\nthe incoming freshman class the hardest,<br />\neven the traditionally large freshman<br />\nchemistry class, normally held in<br />\nRemsen 1, has been re-organized into an<br />\ninformal seminar to be held in the<br />\n\u2022 snackbar of the freshman dorms.<br />\nOther expected improvements are the<br />\nend of the housing shortage, and a<br />\nsolution to the formerly sticky parking<br />\ncrisis.

Many,<br />\nhowever, said that they had to sell their<br />\ncars in order to pay the higher tuition<br />\ncosts, and thus have no parking problems<br />\nanyway.<br />\nAn interview with Director of Housing,<br />\nPeter Heist, revealed similar findings.<br />\nHeist asserted, \"The fact that over 85%<br />\nof those living in University housing last<br />\nyear said that they could not afford it<br /><br />\nthis year meant that we were able to<br />\ndump our emergency plans of buying up<br />\nthe Greenway pharmacy and Eddie's<br />\nsupermarket and converting them into<br />\nstudent co-ops. In fact we have surplus<br />\nhousing and may lease it back to some of<br />\nthe senior citizens who used to live there<br />\nin the first place.\" Heist added that he<br />\nhas heard far fewer complaints about<br />\nexcess noise so far this year.<br />\nAnother side benefit is a noticeable<br />\nreduction in the size of lines in the Book<br />\nCenter and especially the bank in Gilman<br />\nFlail. When asked how he was able to<br />\nimprove service at the bank so markedly<br />\nin such a short time, the manager stated,<br />\n\"Well, we do have fewer new accounts<br />\nthis year. Also, most of our old returning<br />\ncustomers tell us they have less money,<br />\nanyway.\"<br />\nDespite all this optimism, there are a<br />\nfew gloomy drawbacks.

I understand how students' budgets<br />\nare tighter this year, but I did expect a<br />\nbit more enthusiasm.<br />\n\"It's more than a building, it's an<br />\nidea,\" Sydnor added.<br />\nMany find it hard to dig up enough<br />\npeople for a touch-football game. The<br />\ngym is less crowded, but ping-pong balls,<br />\npaddle balls and paddle racquets, and<br />\nnon-caustic soap are still unavailable.

It was not<br />\nso long ago that Hopkins rejected a substantial grant<br />\nfrom the ACTION agency which would have allowed a<br />\nlimited number of undergraduates to work in the community while receiving academic credit for a semester.<br />\nThe ACTION grant was turned down by the Academic Council on the grounds that the federal government imposed too many requirements in connection<br />\nwith the grant. In the case of the Labor Department<br />\nfunds, Hopkins lost the grant because the University<br />\nrequested an additional 57 percent of the grant over<br />\nthe initial amount to cover \"overhead costs.\"<br />\nHowever, as is the situation with most issues<br />\nconcerning community involvement, these grants will<br />\nnot be missed by many people for very long. They<br />\nwill, instead, go down in the records as two more<br />\nneglected opportunities that Hopkins had to involve<br />\nitself in the community which, for the most part, it<br />\nwould prefer to ignore. The University very conviently<br />\nblew the Labor funds by tacking on an exorbitant<br />\nrequest for more money.

The<br />\nColts great wide receiver warmed<br />\nup before last Sunday's triumph<br />\nover Buffalo, but was again<br />\nunable to perform.<br />\nIt came as a surprise to some<br />\nwhen the Colts tabbed Hinton as<br />\ntheir number one draft pick in<br />\n1969. After all, the Colts already<br />\nboasted a receiving unit of Willie<br />\nRichardson, Orr, and Ray<br />\nPerkins. Why draft another<br />\npotential receiver? The answer<br /><br />\ncame soon enough.<br />\nOrr retired and Richardson<br />\nwas shipped off to Pittsburgh in<br />\nexchange for Roy Jefferson. A<br />\nyear later Jefferson was gone,<br />\nand now Perkins has retired.<br />\nHinton became the Colts'<br />\npremiere pass catcher after only a<br />\nyear on the bench.<br />\n\"I observed from the sidelines,<br />\nbut there was just so much I<br />\ncould learn,\" Hinton explained.<br />\n\"With playing experience, you<br />\ncan learn from your mistakes.\"<br />\nNor did the Oklahoma<br /><br />\nAll-American disappoint anyone.<br />\nIn 1970, he finished second in<br />\nthe A.F.C. in pass receiving with<br />\n47 catches for 733 yards and five<br />\ntouchdowns. Last year he led the<br />\nclub with an unbelievable 21.5<br />\nyards per catch, hauling in 25<br />\npasses for 536 yards. His biggest<br />\ngame came in 1970 when he<br />\ndevastated the Kansas City<br />\ndefense for 11 receptions<br />\ncovering 190 yards.<br />\nHinton's college career was<br />\neven more amazing considering<br />\nthe fact that he started out as a<br /><br />\nrunning back before coming on<br />\nhis senior year to set a<br />\nconference record of 60 catches<br />\nfor 967 yards and six<br />\ntouchdowns. This was an<br />\nincredible feat for a club that<br />\nattempted fewer passes than any<br />\nother Big Eight team.<br />\n\"I had to make a big<br />\nadjustment from college to pro<br />\nball,\" Hinton replied when asked<br />\nabout the basic difference<br />\nbetween the two levels.<br />\n\"In college, the emphasis is on<br />\nspeed, while in pro ball the need<br /><br />\nF&amp;M game A multitude of offensive mistakes<br />\nMomentum, or the lack of it,<br />\nand mistakes were the downfall<br />\nof the Blue Jay football team last<br />\nSaturday in their home opener at<br />\nHomewood Field, as Hopkins<br />\ndropped a 14-10 decision to the<br />\nDiplomats of Franklin &amp;<br />\nMarshall.

It was his 52<br />\nyard return of a punt that set up<br />\nHopkins only touchdown - a<br />\nThomas pass to Grant Shevchik.<br />\nNolan also picked off a Diplomat<br />\npass and returned it to the<br />\nvisitor's ten yard line only to<br />\nhave pass interference called on<br />\nthe other side of the field.<br />\nThe offensive line was also<br />\ninconsistent. At times they<br />\nblucked superbly, but at other<br />\ntimes, they allowed the rugged<br />\nDiplomats to dump Thomas and<br />\nthrow running backs for losses,<br />\nespecially on crucial third down<br />\nsituations.<br />\nAs for the defense, the Blue<br />\nJays played hard-nosed football,<br />\ncan return punts and kickoffs,<br />\ngetting burned a couple of times<br />\nintercept passes on defense, and on<br />\nlong passes, but containing<br />\ncatch them on offense.

Standing five feet<br />\nseven inches tall and weighing<br />\nonly 155 pounds, he is easily<br />\nmistaken for an ordinary college<br />\nstudent. Yet, as unimpressive as<br />\nBilly may seem, he is still an<br />\nimposing figure on the gridiron.<br />\nHead Coach Dennis Cox<br />\nutilizes Billy as a wide receiver on<br />\noffense and a cornerback on<br />\ndefense. His quickness and<br />\nknowledge of football make up<br />\nfor any lack of size he might<br />\npossess.<br />\nNolan's explosiveness and<br />\nquick starts also make him a<br />\nvaluable kickoff and punt return<br />\nman. In both games this season<br />\nhe has broken punt returns, one<br />\nfor a touchdown and one for a<br />\nlong gain that led to a<br />\ntouchdown.<br />\nIn the 14-10 loss to F&amp;M,<br />\nBilly ran back a 52 yard return to<br />\nthe Diplomat 11. Yet his<br />\ncompetitive spirit was not<br />\nsatisfied. He felt that he should<br />\nhave gone all the way.. \"I cut<br />\ninside and got tripped up. If I<br />\nhad gone outside, I would have<br />\nscored.\"<br />\nNolan's interception in the<br />\nclosing minutes of the first half<br />\nalso could have changed the<br />\noutcome of the game if not for<br />\noffsetting penalties. Les<br />\nMatthews bumped a receiver in<br />\nthe middle of the field while the<br />\nball was in the air heading toward<br />\nthe right sideline where Nolan<br /><br />\nfor balance and quickness is just<br />\nas demanding,\" the 6'0\"<br />\nsuperstar- remarked. \"You have<br />\nto learn to recognize the defenses<br />\nas well as learn your pass<br />\npatterns.\"<br />\nHinton rates next Sunday's<br />\nclash with San.

Instead, he<br />\npointed out a few of the errors<br />\nthat prevented the team from<br />\nwinning. He,felt that if they had<br />\nbeen able to eliminate the<br />\npenalties and other blatant<br />\nmistakes, the game would have<br />\nturned out better for the Blue<br />\nJays.

From the very beginning,<br />\nthe Blue Jay offense and defense<br />\nastonished the Blue Hens of<br />\nDelaware with tactics that the<br />\nDelaware team thought couldn't<br />\nexist on the twice-beaten<br />\nHopkins team.<br />\nAfter defeats to Haverford and<br />\nTwoson State Colleges, the Blue<br />\nJay soccer team may have looked<br />\nahead to the Delaware games as a<br />\nprobable loss, due to the team's<br />\nreputation and its previous<br />\nrecords. Yet the Jays certainly<br />\ndidn't let this thought affect<br />\ntheir play. Light blue jerseys<br />\nswarmed on every ball in play.<br />\nBlue Jay defensive backs, Andy<br />\nSmith, Lou Podrazik, John<br />\nGoldwine, and Ed Koza surprised<br />\nthe Blue Hen offensive squad<br />\nwho are known for their fancy<br />\nball handling and tricky<br /><br />\nfootwork. The Hopkins midfield<br />\nsquad did likewise, turning Blue<br />\nHen defensive clears into Blue<br />\nJay offensive plays, tripling the<br />\namount of shots on goal allowed<br />\nby Delaware in two previous<br />\ngames.<br />\nAs in the past two games, in<br />\nwhich the opponents got the first<br />\ngoal, Delaware's Jeff McBrearty<br />\nput in the first after twenty-five<br />\nand a half minutes had gone by<br />\nin the first half of the game.<br />\nHopkins' goalie, Keith<br />\nNaunheim, blocked a cross from<br />\nthe left side of the field by Chip<br />\nSmallwood but didn't quite tip<br />\nthe ball high enough to go over<br />\nthe crossbar. The ball rebounded<br />\noff the crossbar onto the foot of<br />\nMcBrearty who booted it into<br />\nthe net.<br />\nDelaware scored again five<br />\nminutes later when a shot from<br />\nMcBrearty bounced off<br />\nNaunheim's chest on to the<br />\nawaiting foot of Jerry Cooper of<br />\nDelaware who drove it by the<br />\ngrounded goalie.<br />\nPlay continued through the<br />\nremainder of the first half with<br />\nthe Blue Jays still as aggressive \"then as they were at the start of<br />\nthe game.<br />\nThe second half went fifteen<br /><br />\nminutes without a goal, until a<br />\nDelaware fullback was called for<br />\nholding right wing, Phil Heiter, in<br />\nthe penalty area. Heiter who had<br />\na one-on-one situation with the<br />\nDelaware goalie, was fouled by<br />\nthe Delaware man, thus<br />\npermitting Hopkins a penalty<br />\nkick.<br />\nFirst Goal _<br />\nFreshman Joe Rutkowski<br />\nplaced the ball into the net off<br />\nthe goal post. This was the first<br />\ngoal for Rutkowski in a Blue Jay<br />\nuniform.<br /><br />\nTen minutes later, McBrearty<br />\nput in his second goal, the team's<br />\nthird, through the hands of<br />\nHopkins' freshman goalie Jack<br />\nBukowski. But the Blue Jays<br />\nrefused to give up.<br />\nAfter a series of offensive<br />\nthrusts by the Hopkins team,<br />\nsophomore Charlie Gilman sent a<br />\nrebound from a free kick to the<br />\nawaiting foot of Robert Arguero<br />\nwho placed the ball to the far<br />\npost away from the Delaware<br />\ngoalie. This made the final score,<br />\n3-2.<br /><br />\noctober 6, 1972/news-letter/page 11<br /><br />\n[ Dubiel is his own 'rabbit'<br />\nRuss Dubiel, who never ran<br />\ncross-country until he came to<br />\nHopkins, is rapidly developing<br />\ninto one of the finest distance<br />\nrunners in the area and has<br />\nunquestionably become the<br />\nmainstay of the much-improved<br />\nBlue Jay squad.<br />\nA junior, earth and planetary<br />\nscience major, Russ began his<br />\ntrack career in the seventh grade<br />\nin his hometown of East<br />\nMassapequa Park, Long Island.<br />\nAlthough a top runner<br />\nthroughout hish school, his<br />\nprimary interest was soccer, and<br />\nhe hoped to continue the sport at<br />\nHopkins. In his freshman year,<br />\nhowever, Russ changed his mind:<br />\n\"I thought it would help my<br />\nspring track performance if I ran<br />\ncross-country,\" he recalls, and<br />\nthe soccer team's loss became the<br />\nharriers' gain.<br />\nSo far, Russ is delighted that<br />\nhe made the switch, and is very<br />\ncontent with the Hopkins<br />\nprogram. \"I like the level of<br />\ncompetition here,\" he says,\"and<br />\nsince I'm definitely not the best<br />\nin the league, there's still<br />\nsomething to work for.\"<br />\nDubiel reserves his highest<br />\npraise for Coach Don Masken,<br />\nwhom he calls \"the best coach<br />\nI've ever had.\" His chief asset,<br />\naccording to Russ, is his<br />\nflexibility -- his knack of<br />\nhandling different runners in<br />\nvaried ways. \"A guy at Hopkins<br />\nis here primarily for an<br />\neducation,\" Russ maintains,<br />\n\"Running is secondary. This<br />\nmakes it hard on their leader, but<br />\nCoach Masken recognizes it and<br />\nmodifies his policies to suit his<br /><br />\nrunners. He is more interested in<br />\nmolding a team than developing a<br />\nsuperstar.\"<br />\nThe average cross-country<br />\ncourse spans about five miles, but<br />\nDubiel might prefer it to be a bit<br />\nlonger. He admits to feeling<br />\n\"better\" after running a slightly<br />\nlonger distance, and does not feel<br />\nthat an extended course would<br />\nlessen his effectiveness.<br />\nThe first five finishers on each<br />\nteam count in the scoring in a<br />\ncross-country meet, but if one<br />\nteam finishes first, second, and<br />\nthird they win automatically,<br />\nregardless of the times of their<br />\nnext two finishers. It is Russ'job<br />\nto make sure that such a sweep<br />\ndoesn't occur, and to keep pace<br />\nwith the opposition's number<br />\none man. \"I really don't worry<br />\nabout my time,\" he asserts. \"I'm<br />\nout to help the team.\"<br />\nDubiel prefers to begin a race<br />\nquickly, so that he can \"start in<br />\nfront and stay in front,\" and<br />\nlikes to know that \"there's<br />\nnobody for me to catch.\" This<br />\nsaves one of his teammates from<br />\nhaving to set the pace for him -- a<br />\ntactic many longdistance runners<br />\nrequire -- since Russ is his own<br />\n\"rabbit.\"<br />\nWhen he's not running or<br />\nstudying, Russ finds time to be<br />\nco-director of \"Chester's Place\"<br />\n(the Friday night social center of<br />\nJHU) and troop coordinator of<br /><br />\nthe Outing Club. \"Since I'm<br />\ncoordinator,\" he laughs, \"I can<br />\nschedule the trips around my<br />\nmeets.\"<br />\nThe success that he's enjoyed<br />\nthus far has not made Russ<br />\ncomplacent, but he remains<br />\nextremely confident of his<br />\nability. \"So far no one's passed<br />\nme at the end of a race,\" he is<br />\nquick to point out, and if Russ<br />\nDubiel and Coach Masken have<br />\ntheir way, no one will for quite<br />\nsome time.<br /><br />\nYesterday afternoon, Athletic<br />\nDirector Marshall S.
