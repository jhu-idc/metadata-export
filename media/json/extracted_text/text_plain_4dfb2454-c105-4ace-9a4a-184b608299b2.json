The<br />\noccasion is the Twentieth Annual<br />\nIndoor Games of the Georgetown<br />\nUniversity Athletic Association.<br />\nThe meet will be held on the large<br />\nand comfortable floor of Convention Hall. The first event is scheduled for 7:30 P. AI., and in all probability the team will leave for<br />\nWashington in the early afternoon.<br />\nThe list of events includes: 50yard dash (open), 440-yard run<br />\n(open), 600-yard run (novice),<br />\n880-yard run (open), one-mile run<br />\n(open), pole vault, running high<br />\npimp and 16-pound shot put (all<br />\nOpen). All these events are handicap, and in addition there will be<br />\na special one-mile invitation relay<br />\nand a two-mile relay race for the<br />\nSouth Atlantic Intercollegiate A. A.<br />\nVarious<br />\nprep<br />\nchampionship.<br />\nschools and clubfs will also have<br />\nevents to suit their abilities.<br />\nThe two-mile relay team which<br />\nWill represent Hopkins will probably be picked from the following<br />\nHien Booth, Somerville, Edwards,<br />\nNorwood and Milligan. The Black<br />\nand Blue will again display the<br />\nWares of its championship mile relay team when it matches Lehigh,<br />\nand it is possible also that a medley relay may again perform. The<br />\n600-yard novice event will furnish<br />\nan admirable chance for some of<br />\nthe University's, as yet, untried<br />\nrunners. Joe Thompson and Bob<br />\nSkinner, in the 440; - Booth and<br />\nMilligan, in the mile, and Clark and<br />\nAaronson, in the dashes, will be<br />\nsure to rake in some places for<br />\nHopkins. Dr. Ray Van Orman<br />\nand Mr. Kistler will make the trip<br />\nWith the team to act in the capacity of officials at the meet. From<br />\nall indications, Hopkins stands a<br />\nbeautiful chance of bringing back<br />\nthe team trophy to be displayed at<br />\nHomewood. It is certain that the<br />\nSquad will not be tied down by insurmountable handicaps, as was the<br />\ncase at the Arniory last Saturday<br />\nnight, and, accordingly, can be<br />\nlooked upon to garner more places<br />\nIn the open events.<br />\nMusical Club Concert<br />\nat<br />\nState Normal School,<br />\nTowson<br />\nat 8 P.

The<br />\ndinner took the place of the regular meeting of the Board and was<br />\nfor the purpose of discussing new<br />\n\"rushing\" rules for next year. The<br />\ncommittee, which had been previously appointed to find out what<br />\nrushing agreement existed at other<br />\ncolleges, submitted their plans to<br />\nthe Board for discussion. The<br />\nrushing rules of Cornell and University of Pennsylvania, the two<br />\nbiggest fraternity colleges in the<br />\ncountry, were put together and<br />\nrules for Hopkins were drawn<br />\nfrom these. The rules decided<br />\nupon by the Board will, however,<br />\nbe sent to chapters through the<br />\nmembers of the Board before they<br />\nare finally adopted and made public. Upon ratification by the various chapters on the campus, these<br />\nnew regulations should come into<br />\neffect.<br />\nCALL THE LAWN MOWER!<br />\n<br />\nHeard in a certain cafe on The shades of night were falling<br />\nfast,<br />\nCharles Street:<br />\nAs up old Waikiki there passed<br />\n\"Waiter!

There are plenty of men on the campus with sufficient ability to lead a team in the competition, but<br />\nthey have yet to come forward.

It will pay\u2014in<br />\ncold cash.<br />\n<br />\nTHE PROPOSED FRATERNITY RUSHING SEASON<br />\nThe proposed fraternity rushing season agreement, which is now<br />\nbefore the respective chapters, would go a long way toward preventing unnecessary friction between the various groups next year.<br />\nBy providing a long period in which the fraternities and new men<br />\ncan look each other over it would prevent many regrets on both<br />\nsides, and by allowing the open discussion of fraternities, it would<br />\nabolish much hitherto unavoidable suspicion. The section which allows a certain time for each fraternity's party would do away with<br />\nmuch hard feeling, while by preventing the cutting of morning<br />\nclasses and forbidding initiation until after the mid-year examinations, the scholarship of the entering class would be much improved.<br />\nThe late date of opening is welcomed by the athletic authorities, and<br />\nthe clause limiting the number of dates any fraternity may have with<br />\none man is admittedly fair. Incidentally, the clause requiring from<br />\neach fraternity a bond of $100.00 against infractions would do much<br />\nto prevent any violations.<br />\n<br />\nPublished lit ,<br />\nthe interest ofElectrical Development by<br />\nan Institution that will<br />\nbe helped by whatever helps the<br />\nIndustry.<br />\n<br />\nAltogether the proposal is very comprehensive and satisfactory<br />\nto the fraternity situation as a whole. It can not be expected that<br />\nany season will be ideal to each crowd. The only thing that we can<br />\nhope for is that each chapter will be broad-minded enough to see<br />\nthat such a season would be for the best interests of the fraternities<br />\nas a whole and, therefore, make some sacrifice.

The first event is scheduled for 7:30 P.

The<br />\ndinner took the place of the regular meeting of the Board and was<br />\nfor the purpose of discussing new<br />\n\"rushing\" rules for next year. The<br />\ncommittee, which had been previously appointed to find out what<br />\nrushing agreement existed at other<br />\ncolleges, submitted their plans to<br />\nthe Board for discussion. The<br />\nrushing rules of Cornell and University of Pennsylvania, the two<br />\nbiggest fraternity colleges in the<br />\ncountry, were put together and<br />\nrules for Hopkins were drawn<br />\nfrom these. The rules decided<br />\nupon by the Board will, however,<br />\nbe sent to chapters through the<br />\nmembers of the Board before they<br />\nare finally adopted and made public. Upon ratification by the various chapters on the campus, these<br />\nnew regulations should come into<br />\neffect.<br />\nCALL THE LAWN MOWER!<br /><br />\nHeard in a certain cafe on The shades of night were falling<br />\nfast,<br />\nCharles Street:<br />\nAs up old Waikiki there passed<br />\n\"Waiter!

The section which allows a certain time for each fraternity's party would do away with<br />\nmuch hard feeling, while by preventing the cutting of morning<br />\nclasses and forbidding initiation until after the mid-year examinations, the scholarship of the entering class would be much improved.<br />\nThe late date of opening is welcomed by the athletic authorities, and<br />\nthe clause limiting the number of dates any fraternity may have with<br />\none man is admittedly fair.

It can not be expected that<br />\nany season will be ideal to each crowd. The only thing that we can<br />\nhope for is that each chapter will be broad-minded enough to see<br />\nthat such a season would be for the best interests of the fraternities<br />\nas a whole and, therefore, make some sacrifice.
