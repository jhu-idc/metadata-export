Another pledge has been received from the Freshman Class,<br />\npledging all its members to obey<br />\nthe freshman regulations, in the<br />\nfuture, to the letter.<br />\nFollowing the reception of these<br />\ntwo communications, the Student<br />\nCouncil decided that the enforcement of the freshman regulations<br />\nwas to be forever a matter for<br />\nthe whole University, and that action taken by any one class, as a<br />\nclass, would be met with the severest penalty. If any freshman<br />\nis found to have broken his pledge,<br />\nhowever, the matter is to be open<br />\nto any member of the University<br />\nwho sees fit to take action.<br />\nIn other words, any freshman<br />\nwho leaves his skull cap at home,<br />\nor smokes in the Gilman Hall<br />\nbasement, or does any other of<br />\nthe things prohibited by the Student Council, may expect to meet<br />\nwith summary punishment from<br />\nthe nearest bystanders, instead of<br />\npunishment meted . out by the<br />\nsophomores as a class.<br />\nThe pledges to abstain from all<br />\nclass disorder apply to the banquets to be held in the spring, as<br />\nwell as to hazing. Any freshman<br />\nor sophomore who attempts to<br />\nstart anything of a pugnastic nature during this period will be acting in direct violation of these<br />\npledges, and, in all probability,<br />\nwill be summarily expelled.<br />\nThe Council is equally determined to prevent the revival of<br />\nhazing at the University on account of any failure of freshmen<br />\nto obey reasonable rules, and consequently will see that the freshman regulations are strictly enforced. It believes that, when it<br />\nis clearly recognized that responsibility for the enforcement of<br />\nsuch rules is not in the hands of<br />\nthe sophomores, but belongs to the<br />\nwhole college, not only will class<br />\ndisorders be eliminated, but the<br />\nregulations themselves will be<br />\nmuch more rigorously carried out.<br />\nAnnouncement has been made<br />\nby the Council that the remainder<br />\nof the freshman caps which were<br />\nordered will arrive at the University this week. All freshmen who<br />\nare not supplied with these caps<br />\nare requested to hand in their<br />\nnames, in order that there may be<br />\nno confusion in the distribution.<br />\n<br />\n1:21<br />\n<br />\nBALTIMORE, MD., JANUARY 22, 1917.<br />\n<br />\nPRESIDENT APPOINTS INVESTIGATION COMMITTEE<br />\nTwenty Men Selected From Alumni, Undergraduates, Graduate<br />\nStudents, and Faculty, to Make Study of General<br />\nAthletic Condition at Hopkins and to<br />\nShape Policy for the Future.<br />\n<br />\nPERSONNEL OF THE COMMITTEE<br />\nGeorge L.

Reaney Wolfe<br />\nB Howell Griswold, Jr.<br />\nDr. Thomas R. Brown<br />\n<br />\nPresident Frank J. Goodnow, at<br />\nthe request of the Hopkins circle<br />\nof the Omicron Delta Kappa Society, has appointed a committee of<br />\ntwenty men, including representatives of the alumni, undergraduate<br />\nand graduate students, and faculty, to conduct a general investigation of the state of Hopkins athletics, to consider the innovations<br />\nwhich have recently been proposed, and to shape a policy which<br />\ncan be consistently used by the<br />\nUniversity in the future.<br />\nThe chairman of the committee<br />\nis Mr. George L. Radcliffe, president of the Hopkins Alumni Association. There are seven undergraduates on the committee\u2014the<br />\npast and present captains of the<br />\nfootball team, the captains of the<br />\nlacrosse, baseball and track teams,<br />\nthe president of the Athletic Association, and the editor-in-chief<br />\nof THE NEWS-LETTER. The representatives of the Medical School<br />\nare Primrose, the captain of the<br />\n1916 championship eleven, and<br />\nLeadbetter, the Bowdoin ex-captain, who has already figured so<br />\nprominently in Hopkins athletics.<br />\nThe faculty is represented by four<br />\nmen, Doctors Brush, Ames and<br />\nAbercrombie, and Lieutenant Elliot. Time remaining six represent<br />\nevery element of the alumni\u2014they<br />\ninclude Corner, graduate manager<br />\nof athletics Coaches England and<br />\nWolfe; \"Father Bill\" Schmeisser;<br />\nDr. Thomas R. Brown,football advisor; and B.Howell Griswold,Jr.,<br />\ntrustee of the Johns Hopkins University and President of the Baltimore Board of Trade.<br />\n\u2022 These men are to have full power of investigation, and, at the end<br />\nof their investigation, according to<br />\nthe plan of the Omicron Delta<br />\n<br />\nHarry C.

Sutton<br />\nReuben Oppenheimer<br />\n<br />\nKappa and according to the tacit<br />\ninstruction which President Goodnow's indorsement of that plan<br />\nimplies, will report what they<br />\njudge to be the best athletic policy<br />\nfor Hopkins to pursue in the future. Nor is there much doubt<br />\nthat the policy advocated by them<br />\nwill be the one officially adopted<br />\nby the University.<br />\nSeveral members of the committee have already requested that it<br />\nbe clearly understood that the<br />\nwork will by no means be confined<br />\nto the consideration of the advisability of adopting undergraduate<br />\nfootball at Hopkins. That subject, of course, will come up for<br />\ndiscussion, and its possibilities<br />\nand relative advantages and disadvantages will be fully investigated; but the action of the President in appointing the committee<br />\nis regarded as too momentous to<br />\nwarrant the limiting of the investigation to one phase of Hopkins<br />\nathletics alone.<br />\nThe Omicron Delta Kappa petitioned the President to appoint<br />\nthe committee just before the<br />\nChristmas holidays. In his letter<br />\nto John C. Knipp, president of the<br />\ncircle, Dr. Goodnow explained that<br />\nthe delay which has occurred in<br />\nthe answering of that petition<br />\nhad been due to the fact that he<br />\nwished to confer with several of<br />\nthe alumni before taking the step,<br />\nand that, for a time, he had been<br />\nunable to get .into direct communication with those with whom he<br />\nwished to consult.<br />\nThe first meeting of the committee will probably be called during the early part of the week.<br />\nBefore that meeting, it is impossible to forecast just how the investigation will be begun, what<br />\nits results will be, or how much<br />\ntime it will consume.<br />\n<br />\nig Lriiir<br />\n<br />\nPRICE, FIVE CENTS<br />\n<br />\nCLASS DEBATING TEAMS CHOSEN<br />\nSteinbach, Edgett and Oppenheimer to<br />\nRepresent Seniors; Duncan, Rothschild<br />\nand Evans,Juniors\u2014Hopkins' Subject Selected for the Triang'e.<br />\n<br />\nAt tryouts held last Wednesday<br />\nand Thursday, Alexander A.

Rothschild and<br />\nHenry C. Evans, with Martin B.<br />\nKohn as alternate, were selected<br />\nas the representatives of the<br />\njuniors.<br />\nThe debate will be held on Saturday, March 3. The subject for<br />\ndebate will be: \"Resolved, That,<br />\nconstitutionally waived, legislation providing for the compulsory<br />\narbitration of labor disputes in<br />\npublic utilities, and prohibiting<br />\nall strikes and lockouts in such<br />\nutilities, should be enacted.\"<br />\nThis subject, submitted by the<br />\nHopkins Debating Council for the<br />\nNorth Carolina-Virginia-Hopkins<br />\n-triangle, has just been selected<br />\nby the votes of the three universities as time question for that<br />\ncontest. It received the second<br />\nvotes of both the Virginia and<br />\nNorth Carolina Debating Councils, each university, of course,<br />\nvoting for its own subject first.<br />\nIt is possible, however, that the<br />\nterm \"public utilities\" may be<br />\nchanged to \"interstate railroads,\"<br />\nas it has been found that the latter phrase would probably make<br />\nthe debate more concrete. This<br />\nsuggestion was made by Virginia<br />\nin its last communication, and,<br />\nhaving been voted upon favorably<br />\nby the Hopkins council, is now before North Carolina for consideration.<br />\nThe two class teams do not expect to do much work upon the<br />\ndebate until after the examinations. The decision as to side will<br />\nbe made by the toss of a coin,<br />\nsometime during the course of the<br />\npresent week. Meanwhile, all that<br />\nthe teams expect to do during the<br />\nremainder of the month is to acquaint themselves, in a general<br />\nway, with the import and the various phases of their subject.<br />\nIf the change in the triangle<br />\nsubject is approved by the North<br />\nCarolina council, the same change<br />\nwill be made for the interclass<br />\ndebate.<br />\nThe tryouts for the Adams<br />\nMedal contest, for which only<br />\nsophomores are eligible, will be<br />\nheld on Friday, January 26, at 1<br />\nP.

Probably the closest<br />\nraces will be those in which he<br />\nand Smith are entered.<br />\nSmith's ability as a sprinter<br />\ncame to light in the meets of last<br />\nspring, when he won several first<br />\nplaces in the quarter and 220-yard<br />\ndash. These will be his big races<br />\nin the coming meet, and the freshies are sure that he will win the<br />\nmeet for them. Among the numerous other candidates for the<br />\nfirst-year team are Bratt, a sprinter of no mean ability, and Bowen,<br />\nits best distance man.<br />\nAs usual, there will be twelve<br />\nevents, one of which is the seniorjunior relay race. The senior<br />\nfour have run victoriously in three<br />\nprevious meets, and hope to establish their record by carrying off<br />\nthe honors in this one. Those on<br />\nthe senior relay team are Straus<br />\n(captain), P. W. Sutton, E. G.<br />\nHall and W. Weeks. The junior<br />\nteam consists of R. N. Dempster<br />\n.(captain), F. Sutton, P.

Announement has<br />\ncome from the highest authorities<br />\n<br />\nthat these necessities are to be<br />\nplaced in conspicuous positions<br />\nover the entire Homewood acreage; and, with that announcement, has come the earnest request that the undergraduates<br />\nshould not let their artistic impulses take them to the point at<br />\nwhich the installation would go<br />\nsuavely unobserved.<br />\nAs a matter of fact, considered<br />\nfrom a point of view entirely cultural, a steel-wired box, capable<br />\nof infinite concealment, is a much<br />\nmore prepossessing object than<br />\nis the discarded remnant of a<br />\npimento cheese sandwich. There<br />\nis the temptation, of course, to<br />\ndiscard such remembrances as<br />\nquickly as possible there is no<br />\nparticularly sacred association<br />\nabout a pie crust or an oil-paper<br />\nwrapping which would tend to<br />\npromote its carrying about on the<br />\nperson. Nevertheless, the amount<br />\nof exertion which the disposal of<br />\nthat crust or wrapping in the<br />\nnearest receptacle would necessitate, is extremely small\u2014and undeniably desirable.<br />\nTheoretically, it is the duty of<br />\nthe Student Council to see that<br />\nthe campus is kept in cleanliness<br />\nand order. But even the sternest<br />\nutilitarian would not have the<br />\nheartlessness to suggest that the<br />\nStudent Council occupy its spare<br />\ntime in picking up dill pickles and<br />\ncigarette papers. Judging from<br />\nthe Hopkins appetite, the maintenance of a clean campus by such a<br />\n<br />\nEnforcing the Freshman Regulations.<br />\n<br />\nThe proclamation of the Student Council, printed elsewhere on<br />\nthis page, crystallizes the theory<br />\nwhich has underlain the entire existence of the freshman regulations. The Council desires that<br />\nit be recognized, once and for all,<br />\nthat the enforcement of these regulations lies, not with any one<br />\nclass, but with the University as<br />\na whole, and that it is the duty<br />\nof every member of the University<br />\nto take immediate action upon<br />\nany violation of those regulations<br />\nwhich he sees.<br />\nThe pledge of strict conformity<br />\nto the rules which the freshmen<br />\nhave given to the Council should<br />\nform the end of a period. Obedience to the regulations has heretofore been entirely too sporadic,<br />\ntoo dependent upon the personal<br />\nvolition of the freshman concerned. Nor, in the great majority of cases, has the transgression<br />\nmet with any penalty whatsoever.<br />\n\" The regulations, if they are to<br />\nfulfil the purpose for which they<br />\nwere created, must be obeyed universally, and to the letter. To<br />\nthat end, the individual students<br />\nof the University should unite in<br />\nusing the power which the Council has bestowed upon them. Any<br />\nfreshman, who, in the future, is<br />\nfound to be disobeying a single<br />\none of the regulations\u2014involving,<br />\nof course, the breaking of his<br />\npledge\u2014should meet with treatment as efficacious as it is summary.<br />\n<br />\nA PROCLAMATION FROM THE STUDENT COUNCIL<br />\nAfter several conferences with the Faculty Committee on<br />\nStudent Affairs, and many meetings in private, the Student<br />\nCouncil wishes to make the following proclamation to the student body:<br />\n\"The action taken by the two lower classes during the past<br />\nweek recognizes the fact that Freshman regulations at Hopkins<br />\nare not enforced by hazing. Both classes have agreed to this<br />\nprinciple. The Freshman class has voted to obey the Freshman regulations, and in the future to refrain from any hostile<br />\nact towards the Sophomores; and the Sophomores have agreed<br />\nnot to take the college law into their own hands.<br />\n\"If any Freshman so far forgets himself as to violate the<br />\npledge which his class has taken, every undergraduate in the<br />\nUniversity\u2014Freshman,Sophomore,Junior,and Senior\u2014is asked<br />\nto call his attention to the fact and to force him to adhere to<br />\nthe regulations. Forcing the Freshman to do this, immediately after the offense has occurred, is not considered hazing.<br />\nThe Freshmen themselves should co-operate and see that their<br />\nfellow-classmen obey the regulations. All kidnapping, putting<br />\nthrough stunts, night parties and the like are done away with.<br />\n\"A class-rush between the Sophomores and Freshmen immediately following an athletic contest,on the scene of the contest, is not considered an infringement of the above rules.<br />\n\"All Freshmen who have lost their caps should immediately<br />\nturn in their names to Mr. John Myers, at the postoffice, and<br />\npay him 50 cents. He will then give a receipt for this amount<br />\nand later when the caps, which are now on their way, arrive,<br />\neach Freshman having a receipt will be given a cap. Freshmen holding receipts will be exempted from the rule of wearing their caps (until they arrive).\"<br />\n<br />\nprocedure, unassisted, would even<br />\ntax the abilities of a benevolent<br />\nregiment of Boy Scouts.<br />\nThere really isn't much trouble<br />\ninvolved in compliance with the<br />\nauthorities' request \u2014 and, too,<br />\nthere enters into the matter a<br />\nslight element of courtesy.<br />\n<br />\nCo-operation.<br />\nBy A.

The different organizations and groups are beginning to<br />\nrealize that the whole is greater<br />\nthan any of the parts and that<br />\nthe rounded-out spirit of the University is far bigger than the<br />\nclique of class spirit. One of the<br />\ngreatest needs of any university<br />\nis the co-operating and the unifying of all activities of that institution into a whole to further<br />\nall that is best and truest in the<br />\ncommunity.<br />\nOne manifestation of this spirit<br />\nwas shown in the recent campaign<br />\nfor funds to aid in the prison work<br />\nof Europe.

The subject of his discussion was \"The Butterfly, or a New<br />\nName for an Old Theory of Better Social Order.\"<br />\nThis theory, which the speaker<br />\npresented and advocated most eloquently and convincingly in the<br />\ncourse of his lecture, he named<br />\nby adding the Greek word \"en<br />\n(good)\" to \"economics (the law<br />\nof the home),\" thus making \"euconomics (the good, or beautiful,<br />\nlaw of the home).\" The purpose<br />\nof this theory may be best understood by quoting an excerpt from<br />\nDr. Levy's lecture, which reads as<br />\nfollows:<br />\n\"Justice is generally represented as a woman, blindfolded, with<br />\na sword in her right hand and a<br />\npair of balances in her left hand.<br />\nThe purpose and ideal of 'enconornics' is to put a living feeling heart into her cold and unsympathetic breast.<br />\n\"Thus, gentlemen,\" the speaker<br />\nconcluded, \"when you look upon<br />\nman, think of God; when you look<br />\nthe worm, think of the butterfly.\"<br />\nThe officers of the Menorah Society wish, through THE NEWSLETTER, to thank the Christian<br />\nmembers of the student body who<br />\n<br />\ntook advantage of their invitation, and desire to again extend<br />\na cordial invitation to them and<br />\nall other Hopkins men to be present at all future meetings.

Another pledge has been received from the Freshman Class,<br />\npledging all its members to obey<br />\nthe freshman regulations, in the<br />\nfuture, to the letter.<br />\nFollowing the reception of these<br />\ntwo communications, the Student<br />\nCouncil decided that the enforcement of the freshman regulations<br />\nwas to be forever a matter for<br />\nthe whole University, and that action taken by any one class, as a<br />\nclass, would be met with the severest penalty. If any freshman<br />\nis found to have broken his pledge,<br />\nhowever, the matter is to be open<br />\nto any member of the University<br />\nwho sees fit to take action.<br />\nIn other words, any freshman<br />\nwho leaves his skull cap at home,<br />\nor smokes in the Gilman Hall<br />\nbasement, or does any other of<br />\nthe things prohibited by the Student Council, may expect to meet<br />\nwith summary punishment from<br />\nthe nearest bystanders, instead of<br />\npunishment meted . out by the<br />\nsophomores as a class.<br />\nThe pledges to abstain from all<br />\nclass disorder apply to the banquets to be held in the spring, as<br />\nwell as to hazing. Any freshman<br />\nor sophomore who attempts to<br />\nstart anything of a pugnastic nature during this period will be acting in direct violation of these<br />\npledges, and, in all probability,<br />\nwill be summarily expelled.<br />\nThe Council is equally determined to prevent the revival of<br />\nhazing at the University on account of any failure of freshmen<br />\nto obey reasonable rules, and consequently will see that the freshman regulations are strictly enforced. It believes that, when it<br />\nis clearly recognized that responsibility for the enforcement of<br />\nsuch rules is not in the hands of<br />\nthe sophomores, but belongs to the<br />\nwhole college, not only will class<br />\ndisorders be eliminated, but the<br />\nregulations themselves will be<br />\nmuch more rigorously carried out.<br />\nAnnouncement has been made<br />\nby the Council that the remainder<br />\nof the freshman caps which were<br />\nordered will arrive at the University this week.

Reaney Wolfe<br />\nB Howell Griswold, Jr.<br />\nDr. Thomas R. Brown<br /><br />\nPresident Frank J.

There are seven undergraduates on the committee\u2014the<br />\npast and present captains of the<br />\nfootball team, the captains of the<br />\nlacrosse, baseball and track teams,<br />\nthe president of the Athletic Association, and the editor-in-chief<br />\nof THE NEWS-LETTER. The representatives of the Medical School<br />\nare Primrose, the captain of the<br />\n1916 championship eleven, and<br />\nLeadbetter, the Bowdoin ex-captain, who has already figured so<br />\nprominently in Hopkins athletics.<br />\nThe faculty is represented by four<br />\nmen, Doctors Brush, Ames and<br />\nAbercrombie, and Lieutenant Elliot.

Nor is there much doubt<br />\nthat the policy advocated by them<br />\nwill be the one officially adopted<br />\nby the University.<br />\nSeveral members of the committee have already requested that it<br />\nbe clearly understood that the<br />\nwork will by no means be confined<br />\nto the consideration of the advisability of adopting undergraduate<br />\nfootball at Hopkins. That subject, of course, will come up for<br />\ndiscussion, and its possibilities<br />\nand relative advantages and disadvantages will be fully investigated; but the action of the President in appointing the committee<br />\nis regarded as too momentous to<br />\nwarrant the limiting of the investigation to one phase of Hopkins<br />\nathletics alone.<br />\nThe Omicron Delta Kappa petitioned the President to appoint<br />\nthe committee just before the<br />\nChristmas holidays. In his letter<br />\nto John C. Knipp, president of the<br />\ncircle, Dr. Goodnow explained that<br />\nthe delay which has occurred in<br />\nthe answering of that petition<br />\nhad been due to the fact that he<br />\nwished to confer with several of<br />\nthe alumni before taking the step,<br />\nand that, for a time, he had been<br />\nunable to get .into direct communication with those with whom he<br />\nwished to consult.<br />\nThe first meeting of the committee will probably be called during the early part of the week.<br />\nBefore that meeting, it is impossible to forecast just how the investigation will be begun, what<br />\nits results will be, or how much<br />\ntime it will consume.<br /><br />\nig Lriiir<br /><br />\nPRICE, FIVE CENTS<br /><br />\nCLASS DEBATING TEAMS CHOSEN<br />\nSteinbach, Edgett and Oppenheimer to<br />\nRepresent Seniors; Duncan, Rothschild<br />\nand Evans,Juniors\u2014Hopkins' Subject Selected for the Triang'e.<br /><br />\nAt tryouts held last Wednesday<br />\nand Thursday, Alexander A.

It received the second<br />\nvotes of both the Virginia and<br />\nNorth Carolina Debating Councils, each university, of course,<br />\nvoting for its own subject first.<br />\nIt is possible, however, that the<br />\nterm \"public utilities\" may be<br />\nchanged to \"interstate railroads,\"<br />\nas it has been found that the latter phrase would probably make<br />\nthe debate more concrete.

The<br />\nofficials have been chosen, the<br />\ninvitations have been issued, and<br />\nall entries have been made.<br />\nMelamet and Weech are those<br />\nupon whom rest the hopes of the<br />\nsophs. Many will recall the superb showing Weech made last<br />\nyear in the short dashes and the<br />\nbroad jump. Though he has a<br />\ngood opportunity to carry off the<br />\nlaurels in the latter event, it is<br />\nuncertain, however, whether his<br />\nspeed will surpass that of Beverly<br />\nSmith, the captain and crack<br />\nsprinter of the freshman team.<br />\nMelamet will enter almost every<br />\nevent of the meet, and the sophs<br />\nare confident that he will carry<br />\noff a large number of first and second honors. Probably the closest<br />\nraces will be those in which he<br />\nand Smith are entered.<br />\nSmith's ability as a sprinter<br />\ncame to light in the meets of last<br />\nspring, when he won several first<br />\nplaces in the quarter and 220-yard<br />\ndash. These will be his big races<br />\nin the coming meet, and the freshies are sure that he will win the<br />\nmeet for them. Among the numerous other candidates for the<br />\nfirst-year team are Bratt, a sprinter of no mean ability, and Bowen,<br />\nits best distance man.<br />\nAs usual, there will be twelve<br />\nevents, one of which is the seniorjunior relay race. The senior<br />\nfour have run victoriously in three<br />\nprevious meets, and hope to establish their record by carrying off<br />\nthe honors in this one. Those on<br />\nthe senior relay team are Straus<br />\n(captain), P. W. Sutton, E. G.<br />\nHall and W. Weeks. The junior<br />\nteam consists of R. N. Dempster<br />\n.(captain), F. Sutton, P. Wiggins,<br />\n0. P. Winslow and A. Golder.<br />\nG. H. Shawn is captain of the<br />\nsophomore team M. B.

Announement has<br />\ncome from the highest authorities<br /><br />\nthat these necessities are to be<br />\nplaced in conspicuous positions<br />\nover the entire Homewood acreage; and, with that announcement, has come the earnest request that the undergraduates<br />\nshould not let their artistic impulses take them to the point at<br />\nwhich the installation would go<br />\nsuavely unobserved.<br />\nAs a matter of fact, considered<br />\nfrom a point of view entirely cultural, a steel-wired box, capable<br />\nof infinite concealment, is a much<br />\nmore prepossessing object than<br />\nis the discarded remnant of a<br />\npimento cheese sandwich. There<br />\nis the temptation, of course, to<br />\ndiscard such remembrances as<br />\nquickly as possible there is no<br />\nparticularly sacred association<br />\nabout a pie crust or an oil-paper<br />\nwrapping which would tend to<br />\npromote its carrying about on the<br />\nperson. Nevertheless, the amount<br />\nof exertion which the disposal of<br />\nthat crust or wrapping in the<br />\nnearest receptacle would necessitate, is extremely small\u2014and undeniably desirable.<br />\nTheoretically, it is the duty of<br />\nthe Student Council to see that<br />\nthe campus is kept in cleanliness<br />\nand order. But even the sternest<br />\nutilitarian would not have the<br />\nheartlessness to suggest that the<br />\nStudent Council occupy its spare<br />\ntime in picking up dill pickles and<br />\ncigarette papers. Judging from<br />\nthe Hopkins appetite, the maintenance of a clean campus by such a<br /><br />\nEnforcing the Freshman Regulations.<br /><br />\nThe proclamation of the Student Council, printed elsewhere on<br />\nthis page, crystallizes the theory<br />\nwhich has underlain the entire existence of the freshman regulations. The Council desires that<br />\nit be recognized, once and for all,<br />\nthat the enforcement of these regulations lies, not with any one<br />\nclass, but with the University as<br />\na whole, and that it is the duty<br />\nof every member of the University<br />\nto take immediate action upon<br />\nany violation of those regulations<br />\nwhich he sees.<br />\nThe pledge of strict conformity<br />\nto the rules which the freshmen<br />\nhave given to the Council should<br />\nform the end of a period. Obedience to the regulations has heretofore been entirely too sporadic,<br />\ntoo dependent upon the personal<br />\nvolition of the freshman concerned. Nor, in the great majority of cases, has the transgression<br />\nmet with any penalty whatsoever.<br />\n\" The regulations, if they are to<br />\nfulfil the purpose for which they<br />\nwere created, must be obeyed universally, and to the letter. To<br />\nthat end, the individual students<br />\nof the University should unite in<br />\nusing the power which the Council has bestowed upon them. Any<br />\nfreshman, who, in the future, is<br />\nfound to be disobeying a single<br />\none of the regulations\u2014involving,<br />\nof course, the breaking of his<br />\npledge\u2014should meet with treatment as efficacious as it is summary.<br /><br />\nA PROCLAMATION FROM THE STUDENT COUNCIL<br />\nAfter several conferences with the Faculty Committee on<br />\nStudent Affairs, and many meetings in private, the Student<br />\nCouncil wishes to make the following proclamation to the student body:<br />\n\"The action taken by the two lower classes during the past<br />\nweek recognizes the fact that Freshman regulations at Hopkins<br />\nare not enforced by hazing. Both classes have agreed to this<br />\nprinciple. The Freshman class has voted to obey the Freshman regulations, and in the future to refrain from any hostile<br />\nact towards the Sophomores; and the Sophomores have agreed<br />\nnot to take the college law into their own hands.<br />\n\"If any Freshman so far forgets himself as to violate the<br />\npledge which his class has taken, every undergraduate in the<br />\nUniversity\u2014Freshman,Sophomore,Junior,and Senior\u2014is asked<br />\nto call his attention to the fact and to force him to adhere to<br />\nthe regulations. Forcing the Freshman to do this, immediately after the offense has occurred, is not considered hazing.<br />\nThe Freshmen themselves should co-operate and see that their<br />\nfellow-classmen obey the regulations. All kidnapping, putting<br />\nthrough stunts, night parties and the like are done away with.<br />\n\"A class-rush between the Sophomores and Freshmen immediately following an athletic contest,on the scene of the contest, is not considered an infringement of the above rules.<br />\n\"All Freshmen who have lost their caps should immediately<br />\nturn in their names to Mr. John Myers, at the postoffice, and<br />\npay him 50 cents. He will then give a receipt for this amount<br />\nand later when the caps, which are now on their way, arrive,<br />\neach Freshman having a receipt will be given a cap. Freshmen holding receipts will be exempted from the rule of wearing their caps (until they arrive).\"<br /><br />\nprocedure, unassisted, would even<br />\ntax the abilities of a benevolent<br />\nregiment of Boy Scouts.<br />\nThere really isn't much trouble<br />\ninvolved in compliance with the<br />\nauthorities' request \u2014 and, too,<br />\nthere enters into the matter a<br />\nslight element of courtesy.<br /><br />\nCo-operation.<br />\nBy A. E. LINDLEY<br />\nthe Y. M. C. A.<br /><br />\nGeneral Secretary of<br /><br />\nThe spirit of co-operation is<br />\nvery manifest in the Johns Hopkins University at the present<br />\ntime. The different organizations and groups are beginning to<br />\nrealize that the whole is greater<br />\nthan any of the parts and that<br />\nthe rounded-out spirit of the University is far bigger than the<br />\nclique of class spirit. One of the<br />\ngreatest needs of any university<br />\nis the co-operating and the unifying of all activities of that institution into a whole to further<br />\nall that is best and truest in the<br />\ncommunity.<br />\nOne manifestation of this spirit<br />\nwas shown in the recent campaign<br />\nfor funds to aid in the prison work<br />\nof Europe. Students and members of the faculty, regardless of<br />\ncreed and nationality, joined in<br />\nthis piece of unselfish service.<br />\nLast week, the Menorah Society, composed of Jewish students<br />\nin the University, invited, through<br />\nthe columns of THE NEws-LErriat,<br />\nall students of the University to<br />\nattend a meeting addressed by<br />\nDr. J. 'Leonard Levy, of Pittsburgh, on Wednesday, January<br />\n17. Many students attended, and<br />\nwere greatly benefited by the<br />\nwords of Dr. Levy. The Menorah<br />\nSociety sent special invitations to<br />\nthe members of the Y. M. C. A.<br />\nCabinet.<br />\nIt has beeir the policy of the<br />\nStudent Young Men's Christian<br />\nAssociation, since its origin, to<br />\ninvite all students and members<br />\nof the faculty to all meetings held<br />\nunder its auspices. In another<br />\narticle in this issue of THE NEWSLETTER will be found an invitation to the students of the University to attend a meeting which<br />\nwill be addressed by Dr. Hugh<br />\nBirckhead. His subject will be<br />\n\"Guiding Principles in Choosing<br />\na Life Work.\"<br />\nThe opening of the Student Activities Building should tend to<br />\nfurther develop the spirit of cooperation.

Dr.<br />\nHugh Birckhead, of the Emmanuel P. E.

French,<br />\nof the English department.<br /><br />\nAt a recent meeting of the Johns<br />\nHopkins Engineering Society, Edward M. Stuart was elected president, following the resignation of<br />\nHenry S. Baker from that office.<br />\nMembers of the Society expressed sincere regret that the<br />\npressure of studies and work necessitated Baker's giving up the<br />\nposition. Baker is now an officer<br />\nin the unit of Reserve Officers'<br />\nCorps at Johns Hopkins. He was<br />\na member of the Black and Blue<br />\nlacrosse team last year, and<br />\nplayed a fine game at one of the<br />\ndefense positions.<br />\nEdward Stuart, who was chosen<br />\nto fill Baker's position, was formerly chairman of the mechanical<br />\nengineering branch of the Society.<br />\nFollowing his resignation from<br />\nthat position on being elected<br />\npresident of the Society, William<br />\nD. Cecil was chosen by the members of the Society as chairman of<br />\nthe mechanical branch.<br />\nThe student heads of the various<br />\ndepartments are now, Stanley L.<br />\nHoward, of the civil engineering<br />\nbranch; Louis McC. Young, of the<br />\nelectrical engineering branch; and<br />\nW. D. Cecil, of the mechanical engineering branch. These men will<br />\narrange meetings, which are to be<br />\nheld every three weeks. Each<br />\nbranch of the engineering department alternately has charge of the<br />\nmeetings.<br />\nIt is the idea of the Society to<br />\nhave leading engineers in the various lines and of this vicinity to<br />\ntalk to the Society on the practical problems that confront the<br />\nmodern engineer. The students<br />\nwill thus receive a practical<br />\nknowledge that will give them a<br />\ngreater conception of the theoretical study in the different courses.<br />\nOn Wednesday morning, at 11<br />\no'clock, the Society, with one of<br />\nthe largest audiences that has attended a meeting this year, enjoyed a most interesting lecture<br />\nby Mr. J. 0. Martin, of the C. &amp;<br />\nP. Telephone Company, on \"The<br />\nRomance of the Telephone,\" in the<br />\nMechanical and Electrical Building lecture hall.

J. Leonard Levy delivered<br />\nan address before an audience of<br />\nover sixty students in the Donovan Room last Wednesday at 1<br />\no'clock. The subject of his discussion was \"The Butterfly, or a New<br />\nName for an Old Theory of Better Social Order.\"<br />\nThis theory, which the speaker<br />\npresented and advocated most eloquently and convincingly in the<br />\ncourse of his lecture, he named<br />\nby adding the Greek word \"en<br />\n(good)\" to \"economics (the law<br />\nof the home),\" thus making \"euconomics (the good, or beautiful,<br />\nlaw of the home).\" The purpose<br />\nof this theory may be best understood by quoting an excerpt from<br />\nDr. Levy's lecture, which reads as<br />\nfollows:<br />\n\"Justice is generally represented as a woman, blindfolded, with<br />\na sword in her right hand and a<br />\npair of balances in her left hand.<br />\nThe purpose and ideal of 'enconornics' is to put a living feeling heart into her cold and unsympathetic breast.<br />\n\"Thus, gentlemen,\" the speaker<br />\nconcluded, \"when you look upon<br />\nman, think of God; when you look<br />\nthe worm, think of the butterfly.\"<br />\nThe officers of the Menorah Society wish, through THE NEWSLETTER, to thank the Christian<br />\nmembers of the student body who<br /><br />\ntook advantage of their invitation, and desire to again extend<br />\na cordial invitation to them and<br />\nall other Hopkins men to be present at all future meetings.
