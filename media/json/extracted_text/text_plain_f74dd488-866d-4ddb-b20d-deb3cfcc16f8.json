The<br />\nrule is not new, and is in fact<br />\nclearly stated in the Hopkins<br />\nFinancial Aid Information Package, but Director of Financial<br />\nAid Susan Broadbent concedes<br />\nthat the rule has not previously<br />\nbeen strictly enforced. Due to<br />\nadministrative problems, the affected students were not notified until last week that the rule<br />\nwould be enforced.<br />\nHowever, in response to<br />\ncomplaints by the affected students, Associate Dean of Undergraduate and Graduate Studies<br />\nMartha Roseman has recommended that continuing fmancial aid be reinstated. It appears<br />\nprobable though not definite<br />\n<br />\nthat Roseman's recommendation<br />\nwill be followed; however, the<br />\nrule will be enforced for seniors<br />\nin subsequent semesters. However, after the Registrar's Office<br />\nlearned about one Hopkins senior who was enrolled as a fulltime Hopkins Hygiene and Public Health graduate student,<br />\nreceiving graduate stipends as<br />\nwell as undergraduate aid, a<br />\ndetailed investigation followed<br />\ninto this problem of awarding<br />\naid to graduated seniors.

The study, prepared by<br />\nM. Ramona Montoya and Dr.<br />\nKatharine C. Lyall of the Johns<br />\nHopkins Graduate Program in<br />\nPublic Policy and the Center for<br />\nand<br />\nPlanning<br />\nMetropolitan<br />\nResearch, was commissioned by<br />\nthe University's Office of Community Affairs. It updates a<br />\nsimilar report that was issued in<br />\n1973.<br />\nThe purpose of the report is<br />\n<br />\nto reveal to the local community<br />\nthe ways in which one of its<br />\nmajor \"not-for-profit\" institutions contributes to the economic base. It will also reveal to the<br />\nUniversity the nature and magnitude of its own activities that<br />\naffect the community in direct<br />\nand measurable ways. It is not<br />\nthe primary purpose of institutions such as Johns Hopkins to<br />\ncreate jobs, generate business, or<br />\nboost sales of durable goods<br />\nin Baltimore; rather, the major<br />\ncontributions of the Hopkins<br />\nInstitutions are their social,<br />\nintellectual, and cultural resources. However, the study<br />\ndoes focus on the quantifiable<br />\nimpacts of Hopkins-related activities on three sectors of local<br />\neconomy: business, city govern-<br />\n<br />\nCommunity News<br />\nState Legislation<br />\nIn an effort to arrest the \"condo craze\" which has permeated much of the Baltimore area, including the Homewood<br />\ncommunity,a Senate subcommittee has pressed for the passage of<br />\nemergency legislation that would tighten the restrictions on<br />\ncondominium conversion.<br />\nThe law, if passed, would require apartment owners to set<br />\naside 20 percent of their rental units for senior citizens and<br />\nhandicapped tenants for three years, pay up to $700 in moving<br />\nexpenses for other tenants, and give current tenants the first<br />\nopportunity to buy the new converted units.<br />\nAmong the other bills that have been introduced during<br />\nthis session is a proposal to make peppermint lemonade the<br />\nofficial state drink, a bill to allow 18 ounce yogurt containers to<br />\nbe sold in Maryland and a bill which according to a brief capsule<br />\nsummary in yesterday's Baltimore Sun would \"allow use of<br />\ncampus by junior and senior undergraduate students\" at the<br />\nUniversity of Maryland,<br />\n<br />\nment, and individuals.<br />\nThe study reveals that $326<br />\nmillion in expenditures were<br />\ndirectly or indirectly attributable to the Hopkins Institutions<br />\nin Baltimore in 1980, an increase<br />\nof 66 percent over the 1973<br />\ntotal. Included in these institutions are the Johns Hopkins<br />\nUniversity (Homewood Campus:<br />\nFaculty of Arts and Sciences,<br />\nFaculty of Engineering; East<br />\nBaltimore Campus: School of<br />\nHygiene and Public Health,<br />\nSchool of Medicine), Johns<br />\nHopkins Hospital, the Peabody<br />\nConservatory of Music, and the<br />\nBroadway Management Corporation. These institutions are a<br />\nmajor industry in the city's<br />\neconomic base.<br />\nIn 1980, the Hopkins Institutions produced more than<br />\n24,359 jobs in Baltimore. These<br />\njobs generated more than $160<br />\nmillion in personal income and<br />\nnearly $5 million in purchases of<br />\ndurable goods in 1980. These<br />\nfigures rank Hopkins as a major<br />\nemployer in the Baltimore City<br />\nand metropolitan area. In fact,<br />\nthe Hopkins Institutions employ<br />\nmore people than do the city's<br />\ntwo largest department stores, or<br />\nthree largest newspapers, or all<br />\nits commercial banks. Hopkins<br />\nInstitutions were among the<br />\nfastest-growing employers in the<br />\ncity, increasing employment<br />\nfrom 8,000 to nearly 12,000<br />\nbetween 1973 and 1980.<br />\nThough the Johns Hopkins<br />\nUniversity and Hospital are<br />\ntax-exempt, they are responsible<br />\nboth directly and indirectly for<br />\n<br />\nsizable cash payments to the<br />\ncity. In 1980, Baltimore city<br />\nreceived $11,372,733 in cash<br />\nrevenues from real estate taxes,<br />\nnonreal property tax, state education aid, inspection fees,<br />\nwater, parking tax, and other<br />\nareas.<br />\nThe substantial growth in<br />\nvisitors to the University and<br />\nHospital has also had an impact<br />\non Baltimore's economy. In<br />\n1973, 11,000 visitor days were<br />\nattributed to Hopkins-related<br />\nstaff and activities, while in<br />\n1980, the figure rose to 50,000.<br />\nApproximately $7 million in<br />\nassociated expenditures can be<br />\ntraced to the activities of visitors<br />\nto Hopkins. The largest increase<br />\nin visitors has occured in out-ofstate participants who attend<br />\ncontinuing education seminars at<br />\nthe Medical Institutions. Full<br />\ntime undergraduate and graduate<br />\nstudents at Hopkins spent more<br />\nthan $14 million last year on<br />\ngoods and services in Baltimore.<br />\nThe total number of students at<br />\nthe Hopkins Institutions in 1980<br />\nwas 4,739, up only slightly over<br />\n1973.<br />\nA larger number of<br />\nstudents in 1980 were renting<br />\nhousing in Baltimore city. The<br />\nmedian payment by students<br />\nrenting housing was $160 per<br />\nmonth excluding utilities, more<br />\nthan twice the 1973 amount.<br />\nThe median monthly expenditures of Hopkins students was<br />\nreported to be $121 per month,<br />\nincluding food, books, transportation, and entertainment.<br />\nSince 1976, the Johns<br />\nHopkins University and Hospital<br />\n<br />\nhave constructed nine major<br />\nbuildings in Baltimore city, at an<br />\naverage cost of more than $10<br />\nmillion each. In addition, $3<br />\nmillion per year has been spent<br />\nto repair and refurbish existing<br />\nbuildings.<br />\nConstruction has<br />\nbegun for the Space Telescope<br />\nScience Institute building, budgeted at $8.9 million. The third<br />\nphase of the Biology Complex is<br />\nalso scheduled for this year, at<br />\n$8 million. These two projects<br />\nwill generate an additional 773<br />\nfull-time construction jobs and<br />\n155 apprenticeships in 1982.<br />\nOn the cost side, the city<br />\nprovided services in 1980 for<br />\nfaculty, staff, and students of<br />\nthe Hopkins Institutions valued<br />\nat more than $30 million. $2.1<br />\nmillion went toward the cost of<br />\npublic education for the children<br />\nof Hopkins faculty, staff, and<br />\nstudents.<br />\nIn general, the study estimates, Institutions-related activities in 1980 generated $243<br />\nmillion of additional business<br />\nvolume in the city; accounted<br />\nfor about $78 million of business real property, equipment,<br />\nand inventories; and generated<br />\nabout $75 million in additional<br />\nbank credit in the city. \"These<br />\nfigures place the Hopkins Institutions among some of the city's<br />\nmost substantial businesses in<br />\nterms of their contribution to<br />\nprivate sector economic activity<br />\nin the city,\" state the authors.<br />\nCopies of the report will be<br />\navailable at the Office of Community Affairs in Merryman<br />\n<br />\n\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022**\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022*\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022**\u2022**\u2022******\u2022*****************\u2022****\u2022**********<br />\n<br />\n\u2022 . )B3<br />\nO,<br />\n<br />\n0oe g<br />\nH 0<br />\n<br />\neeemeeecemeeeeeecoceociecieeeeeeeeeeecoc)<br />\ne<br />\nin<br />\n<br />\nProposals for the fall<br />\n<br />\n*<br />\n<br />\nMSE Symposium<br />\nare now being accepted<br />\n<br />\ne!<br />\nO<br />\n<br />\n\u2022<br />\n\u2022<br />\n\u2022<br />\n<br />\nE<br />\n\u2022 e 0)7C<br />\n<br />\nw<br />\nFfil<br />\n<br />\nCE<br />\n<br />\nOctecocooeeelecooeoeclewteciecoecielecv,*****8<br />\n<br />\nin the Student Council Office.<br />\nDeadline is February 19.<br />\n<br />\n\u2022 Sunday,February '7<br />\n*<br />\n<br />\n*<br />\n<br />\na<br />\n*<br />\nAlleGIDGOCOGGIDGGOGGC4DOGGKAD\u2018COGOQGQ4D\u2018GGIDGGOGOGGVIDIDC0OGQ4DQVGGIDGO*<br />\n*<br />\n<br />\naa 11-1 in the Great Hall<br />\naa<br />\naa<br />\nAdmission is $2.50<br />\naa<br />\na<br />\n<br />\n*<br />\n<br />\nMSE Symposium 1<br />\n<br />\n*<br />\n<br />\naaa<br />\naa<br />\naaa<br />\naa<br />\n<br />\n*<br />\n<br />\nii******Clel0e100(141*******fie,04,041041000C10<br />\n0.1000004100450(,0*(5000,5001<br />\n<br />\na<br />\na<br />\n:All<br />\nbagels,<br />\nlox<br />\n,<br />\na<br />\na<br />\na<br />\na<br />\ncream<br />\ncheese,<br />\netc.<br />\nAll interested parties should contact :<br />\na<br />\naa<br />\na<br />\nLinda Gurishefsid<br />\na<br />\neat.<br />\n:<br />\ncan<br />\nyou<br />\nat ext8203<br />\nVIC10000C110001,15000000000410000(50*****0000C10410C004,00*(5000000<14<br />\n<br />\n\u2022 for details on structuring your proposal.<br />\n\u2022<br />\n<br />\nSPONSORED BY THE J.S.A.<br />\n<br />\n*************************************************************1<br />\n<br />\n\fNEWS-LETTER / PAGE 3<br />\n<br />\nUniversity Revises Pay Scale<br />\n.intg Salaries<br />\nWithout Rteduc<br />\n<br />\n44100\u2022ak PAPP.\u2022*--<br />\n<br />\nA new pay Scale should not affect employees 'salaries.<br />\n<br />\nBY ROBIN JOHNSONcomparae<br />\ngraded the same between camUniversity employees are puses [Homewood and East<br />\nAnother concern<br />\nstill unsure of how they will be Baltimore]?<br />\ncompetitiveexternal<br />\naffected by the new salary was<br />\nadministration program being ness\u2014are we keeping up with the<br />\nimplemented by the University. market place?\"<br />\nThe University called in an<br />\nA \"slick\" slide show has<br />\nbeen shown by the Personnel outside firm, Hewitt Associates,<br />\nOffice several times on both which specializes in personnel<br />\nand other Johns consultation, and developed a<br />\nHomewood<br />\n*<br />\nHopkins campuses.

An Incriminating Silence<br />\nA small smorgasbord of items for<br />\npraise and complaint this week. First the<br />\npraise:<br />\nCongratulations to Larry Lappin and<br />\nthe Student Council for their apparent<br />\nsuccess in bringing the Ramones, the<br />\npopular punk group, to Hopkins. While<br />\nthese pioneers of the current forms of<br />\n\"angry young men\" music are not necessarily to everyone's .taste, their \"star\"<br />\nmagnitude should ensure th4it the event is a<br />\nfinancial success. Hopkins has a reputation<br />\nas a rotten concert school, and the Ramones concert should prove that such a<br />\nreputation is undeserved and unnecessary.<br />\nFailure in the past has been a result of a<br />\nkind of vicious cycle of negative thinking<br />\namoung Hopkins concert planners: unwilling to spend big bucks on big names for<br />\nfear of insufficient audience turnout, they<br />\nwent for second-rank performers and got<br />\nthe small turnout they were afraid of, thus<br />\nconfirming their own opinion. (Witness<br />\nlast year's Carolyn Mas and Jorma Kaukonen fiascos.)<br />\nOne note of warning: if the $1000<br />\nplus the SC has reportedly spent on improving the sound system in Shriver Hall is<br />\ninsufficient, then the Council should do<br />\neverything short of building a new concert<br />\nhall next door to ensure that things sound<br />\nokay. The sound in Shriver has been<br />\natrocious in the past; last year, it made<br />\nKaukonen's delicate acoustic first set<br />\ncoarse and cloudy, and his hard rock<br />\nsecond set absolutely unbearable.<br />\n<br />\nLetters to the Editor<br />\n4\u2022115,1<br />\n<br />\nN-L Mismanagement<br />\n<br />\nPhoto Staff<br />\nEllen Farina<br />\nLowell Halvorson<br />\nStephanie Kretchmer<br />\n<br />\nHoward Mertz<br />\nAndy Wolfe<br />\n<br />\nProductkm Staff<br />\n<br />\nTo The Editor:<br />\nThere seems to be a problem with the News-Letter. Last<br />\nsemester wrote to Mr. Levine<br />\nabout an article that appeared in<br />\nthe Arts section. It was a<br />\nwell-done review by Dan Vitale<br />\nof the Page Boys, who happen to<br />\nbe Joe Levine and Walter Hook<br />\n(Mr. Hook happens to be the<br />\nArts editor).<br />\nI suggested then that Mr.<br />\nHook was obligated to review<br />\nfuture acts at Chester's Place.<br />\nBut I remind you, it was only a<br />\nsuggestion, a suggestion which<br />\nMr. Hook didn't follow up on.<br />\nThen there was last week's<br />\nissue. In the box on the front<br />\npage, which usually contains the<br />\nsubject of the week's fold, there<br />\nwas an advertisement for Mr:<br />\nHook's play, Blossius of Cumae.<br />\nTurning to page nine, there was<br />\nanother advertisement for the<br />\nplay. And of course, there was<br />\npage nineteen, where there was a<br />\ntwo column advertisement for<br />\nthe .\"swashbuckling\" play. But<br />\nwas there a two-column ad for<br />\nany other campus note? No.<br />\nThen I ask the management<br />\nto allow other campus activities<br />\nto have two-column ads in the<br />\nfuture.<br />\nBut this will never<br />\nhappen.<br />\nSo three ads appeared for a<br />\nplay that wasn't even a schoolaffiliated event. And what's<br />\ntruly amazing is that Mr. Hook's<br />\nplay. company didn't even pay<br />\nfor the ads.<br />\nThat's two strikes against<br />\nthe News-Letter, and especially<br />\nI<br />\n<br />\nMichael Lorton<br />\n<br />\nCharles McManus<br />\nLinda Nairn<br />\nAd Production<br />\n<br />\nAshwin Belur<br />\nHelene Caloir<br />\n<br />\nAnn Harnwell<br />\nChris Wilde<br />\nCover by<br />\nDana Gillian<br />\n<br />\nOpinion:<br />\n<br />\nFrat Week's No Rush<br />\nBY ROBIN JOHNSON<br />\nConversations in the freshman cafeteria have taken on an<br />\nentirely new dimension these<br />\ndays. Picture two tables: one<br />\nfull of feisty freshmen, the<br />\nsecond, bedraggled, exhausted<br />\nhousemasters. The conversation<br />\n:it table one goes something like<br />\nthis:<br />\n\"Hey, man, whatchado last<br />\nnight?\"<br />\n\"I went to Tequila Tuesday<br />\nand I threw up all over the stairs<br />\nbetween the first and second<br />\nfloor, then I called this Goucher<br />\ngirl that I met at the party, but I<br />\nthrew up on the phone.\"<br />\n\"Good show.\"<br />\nMuch weaker strains are<br />\nheard from table two:<br />\n\"Boy,am I tired!\"<br />\n\u201cwhyr,<br />\n<br />\n\"I carried three passed-out<br />\nfreshmen to their rooms singlehandedly and then I spent the<br />\nrest of the night at Union<br />\nMemorial while the one from<br />\n306 had his stomach pumped.\"<br />\n\"Oh, the old E.R., I know it<br />\nwell.

A<br />\nchange is about to be instituted in both the<br />\nemployee pay-scale system and the employee performance-evaluation system, and<br />\ntypically, the employees are being kept<br />\nlargely in the dark about the specifics of<br />\nhow they will be affected. The administration says that no more than 5 .percent of<br />\nthe employees could suffer a decrease in<br />\npay as a result of a cut in the number of<br />\npay-scales, but it does not say how. Thus<br />\nfar, no one has been given any specific<br />\nfigures on how much a particular employee<br />\npresently making X amount will be making<br />\nunder the new system. A film supposedly<br />\nmeant to 'educate' the employees about<br />\nthe new system dealt only with the old<br />\nsystem, and was described as \"insulting\"<br />\nand \"uninformative.\"<br />\nWhy must the<br />\nUniversity persist in undermining any claim<br />\nit might have to being a progressive employer? - Why can it not reap the obvious<br />\nbenefits of being open with its employees?<br />\nThe atmosphere of stonewall secrecy that<br />\nsurrounds the University's dealings with its<br />\nemployees can only cause many people to<br />\nsuspect the worst, especially given JHU's<br />\ntrack record in employee matters.

One more<br />\nand I'm out of here, because this<br />\nnewspaper is supposed to be a<br />\npaper for the campus and not<br />\nfor a select group of people.<br />\nSteve Eisenberg<br />\nEditor's reply:<br />\nBasically, Steve's got management with its pants down.<br />\nThree free ads were an abuse, no<br />\nmatter how you slice it.<br />\nHowever, Steve's accusations should he somewhat qualified. He says that Blossius was<br />\nnot a school-affiliated event, and<br />\nthis is simply not true. The play<br />\nwas written by an undergraduate<br />\nstudent, sponsored by the Writing Seminars Department, and<br />\nscheduled in the Listening and.<br />\nViewing Room by the Student<br />\nServices Office. It was not,<br />\nhowever, given a budget, and<br />\nthus can he described as a<br />\nschool-affiliated event with no<br />\nmoney. The $200 plus spent on<br />\nthe production came out of<br />\nauthor Walter Hook's pocket.<br />\nIn contrast, the ad space<br />\ngiven Blossius amounted to less<br />\nthan $15\u2014a forgivable donation.<br />\nAgreed, there should not have<br />\nbeen three separate ads, and<br />\nespecially agreed that an ad in<br />\nthe fold box was completely out<br />\nof line, but it is not unreasonable for the News-Letter, at its<br />\ndiscretion, to extend a reasonable amount of charity to an<br />\nunfunded school-affiliated event.<br />\nDoing so does not characterize<br />\nthe N-L as being \"for a select<br />\ngroup of people.\" Had Blossius<br />\nnot been written by the Arts<br />\neditor, it would still have been<br />\n<br />\nthe recipient of a free ad,<br />\nbecause the N-L supports independent student projects.<br />\n<br />\nFor A Warm Dorm<br />\nTo the Editor:<br />\nWith our nation's current<br />\neconomic and energy crises, it<br />\nseems a shame that this comfortable and warm University<br />\nbenefits only the select few who<br />\ncan afford its tuition.<br />\nThe steam heat system is<br />\nalmost too efficient in the old<br />\nhalls and auditoriums on campus.<br />\nAt night, while Plant<br />\nOperations may attempt to keep<br />\ndown temperatures, the University remains hot.<br />\nJohns Hopkins is one of the<br />\ncity's largest employers, and has<br />\nalways made a serious effort to<br />\nhelp Baltimore in any way.

Hundreds<br />\nof people could sleep in Mudd<br />\nHall's auditorium. Poor people<br />\nwouldn't freeze, and the University's heating system would be<br />\nfully utilized.

Nye<br />\n<br />\nThe Bahama Drama<br />\nTo the Editor:<br />\nWith all due respect for<br />\ndifferent opinions, I must express my sorrow at the seeming<br />\nindifference on the part of<br />\ncertain students to much that<br />\nsurrounds our insular campus.<br />\nIn particular, I should like to<br />\naddress the sponsors of the raffle<br />\nfor a sojourn to the Bahamas in<br />\nthe spring.

This is what they<br />\nadvertise in the propaganda<br />\nbooklet distributed to all freshmen. And to tell the truth, I<br />\nbelieve that it does (sort of)<br />\n\u2022fulfill these functions for many<br />\nof the upperclassmen that I<br />\nknow.<br />\nWhat I object to is the<br />\nmethod that has been resorted<br />\nto for recruiting new members<br />\nto perpetuate these organizaThere is something<br />\ntions.<br />\ndistinctly unbrntherly about the<br />\ndestruction that goes on during<br />\nrush\u2014 destruction to property,<br />\npersonal health and self-esteem.<br />\nAnd where in the definition of<br />\nbrotherhood does misogyny<br />\ncome in?

The whole two weeks is<br />\nso obviously colored green and<br />\nprefaced with a dollar sign that<br />\nit's undermining the ideal of<br />\nfraternity and brotherhood. I<br />\npropose that various Hopkins<br />\nfrats seriously consider restructuring the activities upon which<br />\nrush is based. Perhaps the high<br />\nlevel of enthusiasm generated<br />\namong brothers in the quest for<br />\nnew members (and the money<br />\nthey bring in dues) can be<br />\nchanneled into bigger and better<br />\ncommunity-oriented activities.<br />\nSomething like the Phi Psi<br />\n500 race earlier in the semester<br />\nwould be preferable to luring<br />\nfreshmen to frat parties by<br />\nadvertising free Alabama Slammers and kahlua milkshakes. It<br />\nis very irresponsible (not to<br />\nmention illegal) to ply freshmen<br />\nwith hard liquor.<br />\nBut if the fraternities don't<br />\nheed this warning, there has<br />\nalready been a recent crackdown<br />\nby the Inter-Fraternity Council<br />\nand the University Administration that has led to one fraternity already being suspended<br />\nfrom participating in this year's<br />\nrush. Look at the indicators and<br />\nplan accordingly.<br />\n<br />\nI find it callous for a responsible<br />\norganization to offer this vacation as a prize.<br />\nSome who have always led a<br />\ncomfortable life may not understand my dismay. But others<br />\nwho are sympathetic to the<br />\neconomic conditions and feelings of humiliation felt by the<br />\nservants of a tourist economy<br />\nwho must cater to visitors<br />\ntrampling over their land in<br />\nsearch of the exotic and intoxicating may better understand<br />\nme. Are we no more sensitive<br />\nthan those young couples who<br />\nused to take tea by the pyramids<br />\nor shoot peacocks in an earlier<br />\nage? - I sincerely hope we can<br />\nfind better ways to celebrate the<br />\nreturn of spring.<br />\nSincerely<br />\nV.

These tips<br />\nwere produced through much` anguish, through the<br />\npressured epoch of exams, the panic of approaching<br />\nand passing deadlines, and the realization that leaving<br />\nschool on a Thursday night to take advantage of<br />\nAmtrak's excursion fare is more important than<br />\nmissing a few classes or even quizzes.<br />\nPerhaps the most important fact to remember<br />\nin understanding this guide is that, while each student<br />\nis unique, everybody goes through cycles of doubt and<br />\ndepression. This guide does not attempt to change the<br />\nstudent's natural constitution, but helps to recognize<br />\nthe symptoms of typical mental oscillation and offers<br />\nconstructive ways to treat these symptoms.<br />\nI have organized this self-help guide into three<br />\nDepression, Loneliness, and Boredom.<br />\ndivisions:<br />\n<br />\nDepression<br />\nDepression is quite common among students.<br />\nWhat causes depression: Schoolwork is one of the<br />\nmajor causes, as are a recent failure, a physical defect,<br />\nand television watching. Some television watchers find<br />\nthe news conducive to depression, but I find The Love<br />\nBoat invariably depressing. Symptoms of depression<br />\ninclude listlessness, increased or extremely decreased<br />\nappetite, sadness, insatiable desire to sleep, avoidance<br />\nof one's friends, and the playing of certain \"sad\" songs.<br />\nIn a recent survey at a Hopkins party, favorite songs to<br />\naccompany depression included pieces by Keith<br />\nJarrett, Judy Collins, and Pink Floyd, and Hank<br />\nWilliams'\"I'm So Lonesome I Could Cry.\"<br />\nMost people don't realize the enormous energy<br />\ninvolved in thorough depression. For people interested<br />\nin serious depression, three degrees of intensity may be<br />\nfound. Mild depression is constant in some individuals,<br />\nand manifests itself in continual low-key sadness and<br />\nthe use of sarcasm (see \"Silent Sarcastic Retort\"),<br />\nwhich is an effective social defense. Moderate depression requires isolation, self-pity, consumption of<br />\n\"mother foods\"(See \"Mother Foods\"), disorientation,<br />\nand psychological scabbiness. Total depression is a<br />\ntrue art, and, when executed by professionals, saps all<br />\npersonal energy, cuts off outside help, and creates what<br />\nI like to call The Basket-Case Senior.<br />\nOften, friends try to \"cheer up\" the victim of<br />\ndepression, but I maintain that this is not the answer.<br />\n<br />\n\"Don't ever let anyone cheer you up,\" I recommend to<br />\nmy acquaintances. My method of dealing with this<br />\nmental debilitation is called:<br />\n<br />\nCreative<br />\nDepression<br />\nCreative depression strives to channel negative,<br />\nself-defeating energy into productive behavior. The<br />\nidea is not to divert one's attention from the problem,<br />\nbut to come into contact with one's own \"dark side\"<br />\nwhile engaging in some form of positive physical<br />\nactivity. Cleaning the apartment or house is one<br />\nexcellent example of Creative Depression, as are<br />\ngreasing hinges, fumigating, changing car oil, painting,<br />\nbathing pets, and plunging toilets. Part of the therapeutic value of this activity is in realizing that even in<br />\ndepression, the student can function in \"normal\"<br />\nsociety. This builds confidence.<br />\nPhysically unmotivated students may prefer<br />\nintellectual modes of enjoying Creative Depression.<br />\nMemorizing has been found to be a valid form of<br />\nexpressing and enjoying depression to its fullest. Try<br />\nmemorizing poetry. One of my favorite depression<br />\nmemorization exercises is the last part of \"Casey at<br />\nthe Bat\":<br />\nThe sneer is gone from Casey's lips, his teeth<br />\nare clenched in hate.<br />\nHe pounds with cruel vengeance his bat upon<br />\nthe plate;<br />\nAnd now the pitcher holds the ball, and now he<br />\nlets it go,<br />\nAnd now the air is shattered by the force of<br />\nCasey's blow.<br />\nOh, somewhere in this favored land the sun is<br />\nshining bright,<br />\nThe band is playing somewhere,and somewhere<br />\nhearts are light;<br />\nAnd somewhere men are laughing, and somewhere children shout,<br />\nBut there is no joy in Mudville\u2014Mighty Casey<br />\nhas struck out!<br />\nDepression time is also a good time to note<br />\nsong lyrics Which have never before been clear. Slow<br />\ndown and stop the needle. One student discovered the<br />\nBee Gee's hit was really called \"More Than a Woman\"<br />\nand not \"Four-Legged Woman.\"<br />\nNostalgia Theory is another helpful method in<br />\n<br />\nThe time the surfer,landed on the island<br />\nThe time the castaways found a gold mine<br />\nThe witch doctor episode<br />\nHarold Hecubah and \"Hamlet\"<br />\nThe Russian Astronauts<br />\nThe arrival of the \"Mosquitoes\"<br />\nWrong-way Feldman<br />\nGinger's look-alike<br />\nThe headhunters<br />\n00C1<br />\nMake Way for the Ducklings<br />\nCurious George<br />\nBlueberries for Sal<br />\nGreen Eggs and Ham<br />\nWhistle for Willie<br />\nAre You My Mother?<br />\nCapsfor Sale<br />\nLittle Bear<br />\nBread and Jam for Frances<br />\nCecily G. and the 9 Monkeys<br />\nIf constructive, passive activity does not alter<br />\ndepression, a more physical outlet is usually the<br />\nanswer, which is apparent in a technique I call:<br />\n<br />\nAcceptable<br />\nHostility<br />\nWhen constructive therapy fails, destruction is<br />\nthe solution. Anger is a commbn way to vent depression, and hostility can also be used to ease tension. I<br />\nstress \"acceptable\" hostility because the root of much<br />\nviolence comes through unacceptable hostility. Learning to express hostility in harmless ways makes violence<br />\na healthy and useful release. Here are some possibilities<br />\nfor acceptable hostility:<br />\nMake a collage, using magazines or family<br />\nphotographs<br />\nBreak raw eggs in hand, over the sink<br />\nWrite bad wishes and fears on paper and burn<br />\nthe paper (Something my family does every year on<br />\nNew Year's Eve. We call it \"Burning the Bad.\")<br />\n<br />\n\\<br />\n\u2018\u2018XVIMMVI\\<br />\n.vA,\u2018,\\ft\"W\\'W\u2018x\u2022'1/4\u2018X\\VIEVIII\\<br />\n<br />\n\fMother Foods<br />\nOreos and milk<br />\nChicken soup<br />\nTapioca pudding<br />\nJello and ginger ale<br />\nPastina with warm milk and sugar<br />\nPhyllis' stuffed cabbage (See Molly Goldberg<br />\nJewish Cookbook)<br />\nSlightly melted ice-cream, any flavor<br />\nChocolate, especially Toblerone.<br />\nAvoid<br />\nNestles: they kill babies.<br />\nBaked Chicken<br />\nOver-cooked green vegetables<br />\nSoft boiled eggs<br />\nOrange juice<br />\nRice<br />\nApplesauce<br />\nSpinach and liver<br />\nPopsicles<br />\nToast and jelly<br />\n<br />\nHealth<br />\nRoach abuse<br />\nScream underwater (bathtub or swimming<br />\npool)<br />\nThe Silent Sarcastic Retort (SSR\u2014See introduction) is related to Acceptable Hostility, although it<br />\nalso fits under the category of Necessary Repression.<br />\nThe SSR is not the most recommendable way of<br />\nhandling depression, but can be useful in extreme cases<br />\nwhen it is important to act out hostilities while remaining socially acceptable. For example, human stupidity<br />\nis very obvious to people suffering from depression.<br />\nRather than offend an innocent observer, a silent,<br />\nsarcastic retort brings a touch of humor to the situation, while keeping the depressed person as inoffensive<br />\nas possible. Here are a few practice examples of SSR.<br />\nTry them out with friends:<br />\nAt a bus stop: \"Are you waiting for the bus?\"<br />\nSSR:<br />\nOn the morning of an exam: \"Are you ready?\"<br />\nSSR:<br />\nAt Eddie's, after spending $40.00 on two bags<br />\nof groceries: \"Will that be all?\"<br />\nSSR:<br />\nAfter an exam: \"Whudya get?\"<br />\nSSR:<br />\n<br />\nLoneliness<br />\nDepression is not the only symptom of unstable<br />\nmental health. Loneliness is an unavoidable condition<br />\nwhich many people mistake for depression. Ways to<br />\nrecognize real loneliness include listening to the radio<br />\nand television at the same time, talking aloud to<br />\noneszlf, paranoia, and invisibility. Severely lonely<br />\npeople think they are shrinking or expanding freakishly.<br />\nWhat can ease loneliness? First, learn to think<br />\nof it in a positive light. There is a Spanish refrain<br />\nwhich says, \"Mas vale andar solo clue mal<br />\nacompanado,\" which means,\"It is better to walk alone<br />\nthan to be badly accompanied.\" In other words, it's<br />\nbetter to spend time alone than with someone who<br />\ncheapens one's existence. Quality loneliness focuses on<br />\ntime spent alone. It ceases to look at time as a segment<br />\nof misery, a countdown to solitude. Every second of<br />\nQuality Loneliness is a challenge to see how well the<br />\nstudent can tolerate living with him or herself. Time<br />\nloses its sequential arrangement and becomes a Picasso<br />\ncollection of fragmented moments. The mind is expected to wander, to move ahead and backward, to enjoy<br />\nnot having to share, act, or compromise because of<br />\nhuman social obligation.<br />\nI have compiled a short list of Quality Loneliness situations which may serve as guidelines for the<br />\nstudent testing his or her ability to deal with loneliness:<br />\nIt is better to spend a Thursday night writing<br />\nletters on C-Level than to go to the Rat.<br />\nIt is better to watch reruns of Three's Company<br />\nand Barney Miller than to see Weekend WonderFlix'<br />\nCasablanca for the sixth time. Many college students<br />\nthink it is their moral obligation to see Casablancaand<br />\nother old films, so that they can say, \"I saw that old<br />\nfilm in college.\" This is a fallacy.<br />\n<br />\nIt's better to shoot baskets alone than to be<br />\npeer-pressured into a game of BIA basketball because<br />\nsome team is short one player.<br />\nIt is better to cross St. Paul Street and walk<br />\nalone than to meet an acquaintance who talks GPA and<br />\nis a nose-picker besides.<br />\nIt is better to do laundry alone than to compromise one's solitude by attending a class dance in the<br />\nGlass Pavilion which features flat beer and old faces.<br />\n<br />\nBoredom<br />\nFinally, in this brief sketch of mental health<br />\nproblems and treatments for students, boredom must<br />\nbe examined. Boredom is among the commonest of<br />\nhealth nuisances, and is to be blamed for both obnoxious and listless behavior.<br />\nWhat are signs of boredom'? Nail biting, procrastination, listlessness, repetition, depression and<br />\nloneliness are unmistakable signs of boredom. If you<br />\nlearn to recognize these symptoms, sanity is possible.<br />\nFortunately, boredom is easy to cure. Just as in<br />\ndepression and loneliness, creativity plays an important<br />\npart in dealing with boredom. The following is a list of<br />\ndeterrents for boredom.<br />\nPut on make-up. Take it off.<br />\nRearrange your room. Dangle pencils in your nostrils.<br />\nTake the No. 3 bus to Towson and back<br />\nGo downtown and ride the glass elevators in the<br />\nHyatt Regency<br />\nClimb to the roof of McCoy and hang out<br />\nthere.<br />\nSkip pebbles in the President's Pond.<br />\nWrite amusing letters to the editor of the<br />\nNews-Letter<br />\nDesign a septic tank<br />\nBuy M&Ms and segregate them. Eat them color<br />\nby color.<br />\n'Watch T.V. at the Grad Club.<br />\nGo to WaWa\u2014they scoop potato salad as well as<br />\nthey cut cold meat.<br />\nBother friends who are trying to study in the<br />\nlibrary.<br />\nother the bureaucrats in your favorite University<br />\noffice. I like the Placement Office the best.<br />\n<br />\nDiet and exercise are essential. An old refrain<br />\nsays, \"Bowels that move make a sane thinker.\" One<br />\ntrick for foolproof regularity is called \"The Human<br />\nEnema.\" In this diet, you may eat as many meals as<br />\nyou like, but dessert should be a bowl of bran cereal.<br />\nDrink lots of water. Explosive results, and plenty of<br />\nguaranteed sane thinking.<br />\nEveryone knows how hard it is to make time to<br />\ngo to the gym. The squash courts are often full, and in<br />\nthe pool the lanes are usually crowded. Many people<br />\nfall into a dangerous rut called Recreation for Minimal<br />\nEnjoyment.<br />\nThere are forms of enjoyable and convenient<br />\nexercise that are out of the mainstream. Sweating, for<br />\nexample, may not be aerobic dancing, but is a valid<br />\nform of sedentary activity. Dress warmly and go watch<br />\na swim meet in the gym. Do not shed garments.<br />\nAfterwards, go outside and roll in the snow. Another<br />\nexercise idea is bowling. Believe it or not, there is a<br />\nbowling alley in the gym, although the pins don't reset<br />\nautomatically. Ask at the cage. The library is yet<br />\nanother source of exercise. Pretend the elevator is<br />\nbooby-trapped and you can only use the stairs. Pretend the same person who booby-trapped the elevator<br />\nis chasing you through book stacks.<br />\nUniversity housing is a perfect opportunity for<br />\nstudents to form health clubs. A Wolman Hall Club<br />\nmight partake in the following workout: start in the<br />\nbasement with a stretching session; do three wind<br />\nsprints up and down the hall;jog from the basement to<br />\nthe sixth floor; run across the sixth floor to the opposite side of the building; jog down to the fifth floor;<br />\nzig-zag down to the basement again. Repeat twice.<br />\nIf University Housing health clubs don't appeal,<br />\njoin ROTC. Running in army boots appears to be a<br />\nvigorous way to train, and it can never hurt to know<br />\nhow to scale a barbed wire fence.<br />\n(cont. on p. 13)<br />\n<br />\nThese suggestions have helped me a great deal<br />\nthrough college, and even through high school. I do<br />\nnot claim to be \"normal,\" or even sane, but I function<br />\non a semi-adult level, which deserves some credit.<br />\nNotice that these guidelines do not prescribe drugs or<br />\nalcohol, although narcotics and inebriants may also be<br />\neffective ways to deal with depression, loneliness, and<br />\nboredom.<br />\nRemember to appreciate and utilize positive<br />\nmental facilities, and never forget the words of Virginia<br />\nWoolf:<br />\nThe depression, however, now takes the wholesome form of feeling perfectly certain that nothing I<br />\ncan do matters, so that one is both content and irresponsible\u2014I'm not sure that this isn't a happier state<br />\nthan the exalted state of the newly praised.<br />\n<br />\nGraphics by'<br />\n<br />\nCliff Harris & Iromie Weeramantry<br />\n<br />\n\fPAGE 12/ FEBRUARY 5,1982<br />\n<br />\nIMMIGRATION<br />\n<br />\n---\"--fi a-ir Cutting<br />\nF &Design<br />\nst t-v\u2014 \u20147<br />\nor Men<br />\nomen<br />\n<br />\nPROBLEMS<br />\n<br />\nCALL<br />\n332-4150<br />\n<br />\n4<br />\nii.\u2022<br />\n\u20224<br />\nN. .<br />\n100<br />\n<br />\nU.S. visa petitions and appeals<br />\nLabor certifications<br />\nDefense against deportation<br />\nRelative petitions<br />\nU.S. citizenship<br />\n<br />\nPizza<br />\nHot and Cold Subs<br />\nSouviaki<br />\nGyros<br />\n<br />\n235-7083<br />\nSpecial Student Rate - with ID<br />\n<br />\nBlaustein Building<br />\nOne north Charles Street<br />\nBaltimore<br />\nMaryland<br />\n2 1 201<br />\n<br />\n_...... \u2014<br />\n<br />\n_.ANNA\u2022<br />\n<br />\nI,<br />\n<br />\nTHE<br />\n<br />\nDaily: 10 AM -2 AM<br />\nPhone ahead : 467 - 1022<br />\n<br />\nBIRD<br />\nIS<br />\n<br />\n\"BestPicture ofthe Year!\"<br />\nNational Board of Reviews<br />\n<br />\nJim Brown NBC-TV<br />\n<br />\n\"One ofthe Year's 10 Best!\"<br />\nTime Magazine<br />\nL A Times<br />\nGene Shalit Today Show<br />\nJudith Cris!<br />\nRex Reed<br />\nAssociated Press<br />\nPeople Magazine<br />\nNew York Daily News<br />\n<br />\nTHE<br />\nWORD<br />\n<br />\nif,1<br />\n1<br />\n<br />\nI,<br />\n<br />\nIb,<br />\n<br />\nT i no's Lunch<br />\n<br />\n1<br />\n<br />\nr<br />\n<br />\nMonument and Chester Streets It<br />\nAL,<br />\n732-6733<br />\n1<br />\nr<br />\nTHE PEABODY\u2014HOPKINS SERIES<br />\nTHE PEABODY FLUTE ENSEMBLE<br />\nBonnie Lake, director<br />\nPresented by<br />\nThe Johns Hopkins University<br />\nOffice of Special Events<br />\nTHURSDAY,FEBRUARY 11,1982,12 NOON<br />\n<br />\n'<br />\n<br />\nGarrett Room<br />\nMilton S.

STEINER<br />\nThe Baltimore Museum of Art is<br />\nfeaturing a collection of early photographs from the archives of the Royal<br />\nPhotographic Society of Great Britain.<br />\nThe Royal Photographic Society, which<br />\nwas founded in 1853 as \"The Photographic Society,\" possesses a collection of<br />\nover twenty thousand prints and negatives. Under the direction of Sir Tom<br />\nHopkinson, and through the auspices of<br />\nthe International Exhibitions Foundation, roughly one hundred works have<br />\n\u201e<br />\n<br />\nbeen selected to tour North American<br />\nmuseums.<br />\nThe collection, which will be on<br />\nexhibit until Feb. 28, occupies both<br />\nrooms of the museum's Kenneth S..<br />\nBattye Gallery. Spanning the years 1842<br />\nto 1936, the photographs represent a<br />\nwide range of both studio and outdoor<br />\nportraits, architectural studies, landscape<br />\ntableaus and genre scenes. Included in<br />\nwhat has been termed his very \"personal\"<br />\nand \"representative\" selection, Sir<br />\nHopkinson has managed to capture both<br />\nthe characteristically wispy and somewhat impressionistic style of early British<br />\n-<br />\n<br />\nphotography, as well as the more crisp<br />\nand refined forms of what we would now<br />\nconsider to be the styles of Ansel Adams<br />\nor Edward Weston.<br />\nAlthough a good many of the<br />\nphotographers represented do not usually<br />\nappear in North American exhibits, one<br />\nname in the collection, that of Alfred<br />\nStieglitz, stands out. Stieglitz, perhaps<br />\none of the most significant figures in the I<br />\nformative years of professional photography is represented in this collection by<br />\nthree photographic gems. Going to the<br />\nPost (1904), Paris (1910), and A Snapshot, Paris (1911) are all on display in<br />\nthe inner room of the gallery.<br />\n<br />\nAt The Tomb of Tutankhamun(1916)<br />\n<br />\nby Francis James Mortimer, and Lunch<br />\nEqually noteworthy is a wonder- Party (1910) by Horace W.

Simone<br />\ntells us of going home, cleaning house,<br />\ncooking for her kids, and then on Sundays going to see her father in the old<br />\nfolks' home. Mimi asks her, \"When do<br />\nyou get a change?\" Simone confesses,<br />\n\"Here, with you.\" This genuinely moving<br />\nscene reveals to the audience why<br />\nGrumberg is showing us their lives in the<br />\nworkroom; it is the companionship<br />\n(however strained it may be) between<br />\nthese women which is as crucial a part ot<br />\ntheir existence as their home life. The\u2022<br />\nworkroom is not lost time; it's what their<br />\nlives are all about. This distressing<br />\nyet touching reality shows the other Blossius<br />\nwomen that the community between<br />\nthem is crucial to their happiness. All the<br />\ni jokes told by Mimi, all the songs sung by<br />\nGrisel, which seemed to be merely ways<br />\nBriarius, slaves, members of the Roman<br />\nBY JESSICA KUBZANSKY<br />\nof passing the time, become the point of<br />\n-Senate, and more.

Is<br />\nthis figure on stage Blossius, Stoic philosopher, or Blossius, self-scripted character?<br />\nBlossius, who is old and stooping, but not<br />\nstupid, is played superbly by author<br />\nWalter Hook, who explains to the audience that \"all of your lines are taken<br />\ndirectly from history,\" saying later on<br />\nthat \"history cannot be changed.\" This<br />\nconflict of free will and fate is but one of<br />\nthe many issues running throughout the<br />\nplay, as is the difficulty of having individual views in a group-oriented society,<br />\nthe pull of differing familial loyalties, and<br />\nthe age old political question of \"whose<br />\nside agn I on, anyway?\"<br />\ncont. on p. 16<br />\nThe Cast of L'Atelier<br />\n<br />\nHot Women In Workroom<br />\nBY WALTER HOOK<br />\nL'Atelier (The Workroom) by Jean<br />\nClaude Grumberg; Center Stage, through<br />\nMarch 7<br />\nFrance just after World War II; a<br />\nSimone, a French<br />\nseamstress' shop.<br />\nJewess, joins the work force: Mimi, the<br />\nsharp-tongued button-holer, Madame<br />\nLaurence, the uptight, upright mother<br />\nfigure, Marie, the young swing dancer,<br />\nand Grisel, the aging mother who sings.<br />\nFrom their talk we learn that Simone's<br />\nhusband was a German Jew and has been<br />\nmissing since the war. Despite Mimi's<br />\nraucous sexual jokes and playful mockery<br />\nof the boss and other workers, Simone<br />\nstill often sinks into fits of crying.<br />\nThere are ten scenes, all taking<br />\nplace in the Workroom,and between each<br />\nscene a year or so has elapsed. The<br />\nchanges from year to year are subtle.<br />\nGrumberg's point is that their lives don't<br />\nchange much. For at least five years<br />\nSimone is trying to get her husband's<br />\ndeath certificate so she can get a pension.<br />\nMarie gets married and has a child, but<br />\nher life in the workroom stays the same.<br />\nThe lights change from G.E. -60 watt<br />\nbulbs to fluorescent tubes. The fear that<br />\nhaunts the Jewish characters(Simone, her<br />\nboss Leon, his wife Helene, and the<br />\nominous first pressman) only slowly<br />\nfades. Laurence, year after year, gets the<br />\nseat by the window. When the economy<br />\nis bad, Leon becomes bossy and nasty to<br />\ncover up his guilt, but Mimi still calls him<br />\n\"the monkey,\" and beneath his hard shell<br />\nhe is still a marshmallow.<br />\nL 'Atelier is realism carried to the<br />\npoint where dramaturgical form (rising<br />\naction, climax) is sacrificed. The slowness and slightness of the changes in these<br />\npeople's lives is part. of the distressing<br />\nreality Grumberg wishes to portray. But<br />\nsomething very significant does happen to<br />\nthe women over the years.<br />\nThroughout the play, one has a<br />\nsense that through their lives in the<br />\nwokroom stay pretty much the same,<br />\ntheir lives outside the workroom are<br />\nrollicking along.

Both actors give<br />\ndepth and credibility to their characters.<br />\nThe production transcends the<br />\n<br />\ndifficulty of numerous scene changes<br />\nwith good use of an adaptable set, props,<br />\nlights, and special effects. In addition, all<br />\nthe costumes are reasonably authentic<br />\nand the make-up well done.<br />\nIn the first act, the scenes are<br />\ngenerally good and the growing conflicts<br />\ninteresting.

Mimi(Susan Sharkey), who runs<br />\naway from uncomfortable situations<br />\nthrough humor, was portrayed with an<br />\nunnatural stiffness which I found disturbing. Leon (Larry Block) the boss, was<br />\nalways animated, but slurred his words,<br />\nand his characterization was better suited<br />\nto television sitcoms than to serious<br />\ndrama.- William Jensen's haunting portrayal of the first presser, a Jew who<br />\nsurvived the war, was touching, and left<br />\nme wanting to know more about him.<br />\nStudent rush tickets from $6 to<br />\n$10; regular tickets, from $10 to $15.<br />\nL'Atelier is not an evening of light<br />\nentertainment by any means\u2014only for<br />\nthe intellectually intrigued.<br />\n<br />\nlent film, surprisingly enough, knowing<br />\nthis series, based on the novel by Gunter<br />\nGrass. Too bad it has to be seen in<br />\nShaffer 3.<br />\n<br />\nAt the start of Act II, the plot<br />\nthickens, as subplot after subplot devolves upon the main plot, all involving<br />\nBlossius,<br />\ndeviousness and treachery.<br />\nStoic philosopher, marshals much of the<br />\naction in the subplots, hut his constant<br />\ninvolvement throughout the play is kept<br />\nin proportion by many slight authorial<br />\ndigs, as when someone asks Blossius,\"Are<br />\nyou making this up as you go along?\"<br />\nUnfortunately, as the plot becomes more complicated, the play begins<br />\nto deteriorate. The scene changes continue to be unnecessarily numerous and<br />\nbecome annoying. While the action picks<br />\nup, the script seems overly long in places.<br />\nThe play still holds its own,however; the<br />\nGuards One and Two lend a humorous<br />\ntouch with their vacillating loyalties and<br />\ndevious maneuverings. There is also a<br />\nnice bit of physical slapstick when<br />\nBlossius attempts to hide behind a barrel<br />\nwhile Tunis has a rendezvous with a<br />\nRoman captain, who is outstandingly<br />\nportrayed by Donald Gordon.<br />\nHowever, as the action escalates<br />\nand the consequences of the various<br />\nsubplots begin to manifest themselves,<br />\nthe play begins slipping into melodrama.<br />\nIt seems that everything converges at<br />\nonce and we are bombarded with attempted slaughters, liberations, imprisonments, more slaughters, and so on. The<br />\nKing's daughter Synae, played by<br />\nSuzanne Conklin, cries \"All is lost!\" and<br />\nwith this soap-operatic statement the play<br />\nalmost loses us as well.

This ending, while<br />\nposing a fascinating dilemma (does one,<br />\nlike a soldier, simply follow the script, or<br />\norders, in spite of one's beliefs?), seems<br />\nactually to be a wishy-washy ending.

Nevertheless, eight straight points by the<br />\nBears gave Ursinus its first lead<br />\nof the game. The lead switched<br />\nhands six times as Ursinus took a<br />\n39-37 halftime lead. Although<br />\ntrailing by only two points, the<br />\nJays were beaten badly inside.<br />\nUrsinus had many easy hoops,<br />\nwhile Hopkins scored mainly<br />\nfrom the outside.<br />\nThe Jays regained the lead,<br />\n4544, with 14:08 remaining, on<br />\na tip-in by Gary Benninghoff.<br />\nThe lead changed hands five<br />\nmore times until a hoop gave the<br />\nBears a 52-51 lead. The Jays,<br />\nplaying shoddy defense and<br />\nshooting poorly, quickly fell<br />\nfrom striking distance. A 174<br />\nspurt by Ursinus gave the Bears a<br />\n73-69 lead. Most of the points<br />\ncame from the charity line, as<br />\nHopkins, trying to catch up, was<br />\nforced to foul. Nikic led the<br />\nJays in scoring with 17 points.<br />\nSaturday night, Hopkins<br />\noverpowered conference rival<br />\nSwarthmore 65-54.

Two<br />\nweeks ago, Swarthmore extended powerful Widener to overtime<br />\nin a losing effort.<br />\nUnlike the Ursinus game, in<br />\nthis contest, the lead changed<br />\nhands only once. After Swarthmore scored the opening hoop, a<br />\nfoul shot by Nikic and two<br />\nbaskets by Barr gave the Jays a<br />\nlead they never relinquished.<br />\n<br />\nEight points by Chris McShea<br />\nhelped the Jays open up a 27-20<br />\nlead.

Tom Tessitore<br />\nscored the next seven points for<br />\nthe Jays, widening the margin<br />\nto 45-28. A bucket by Barr and<br />\na foul shot by McShea gave the<br />\nJays a whopping point lead and<br />\nthey coasted the rest of the way.<br />\nIn a good team effort, Hopkins<br />\nhad a balanced scoring attack:<br />\nNikic, 14 points; Tessitore, 12<br />\npoints; McShea,9 points; Snider,<br />\n8 points; and Barr, 8 points.<br />\nScott Kautz dished off 8 assists<br />\nand had 4 steals. A key statistic<br />\nwas the Jays' committing only<br />\n12 turnovers, while Swarthrnore<br />\nturned the ball over 23 times.<br />\nWith five games remaining,<br />\nthe Jays are now 2-3 in the MAC<br />\nSouth. Widener will take the<br />\ntop spot, so Hopkins, Ursinus,<br />\nand Washington will be fighting<br />\nfor the second and final playoff<br />\nberth. Thus, the Jays would<br />\nhave to go at least 4-1 in their<br />\nremaining games to qualify.<br />\nWith. only two home games<br />\nremaining, it means the Jays<br />\nmust win twice on the road, a<br />\ntask they have accomplished<br />\nonly once in nine tries.

The<br />\nrule is not new, and is in fact<br />\nclearly stated in the Hopkins<br />\nFinancial Aid Information Package, but Director of Financial<br />\nAid Susan Broadbent concedes<br />\nthat the rule has not previously<br />\nbeen strictly enforced. Due to<br />\nadministrative problems, the affected students were not notified until last week that the rule<br />\nwould be enforced.<br />\nHowever, in response to<br />\ncomplaints by the affected students, Associate Dean of Undergraduate and Graduate Studies<br />\nMartha Roseman has recommended that continuing fmancial aid be reinstated. It appears<br />\nprobable though not definite<br /><br />\nthat Roseman's recommendation<br />\nwill be followed; however, the<br />\nrule will be enforced for seniors<br />\nin subsequent semesters. However, after the Registrar's Office<br />\nlearned about one Hopkins senior who was enrolled as a fulltime Hopkins Hygiene and Public Health graduate student,<br />\nreceiving graduate stipends as<br />\nwell as undergraduate aid, a<br />\ndetailed investigation followed<br />\ninto this problem of awarding<br />\naid to graduated seniors.

The study, prepared by<br />\nM. Ramona Montoya and Dr.<br />\nKatharine C. Lyall of the Johns<br />\nHopkins Graduate Program in<br />\nPublic Policy and the Center for<br />\nand<br />\nPlanning<br />\nMetropolitan<br />\nResearch, was commissioned by<br />\nthe University's Office of Community Affairs. It updates a<br />\nsimilar report that was issued in<br />\n1973.<br />\nThe purpose of the report is<br /><br />\nto reveal to the local community<br />\nthe ways in which one of its<br />\nmajor \"not-for-profit\" institutions contributes to the economic base. It will also reveal to the<br />\nUniversity the nature and magnitude of its own activities that<br />\naffect the community in direct<br />\nand measurable ways. It is not<br />\nthe primary purpose of institutions such as Johns Hopkins to<br />\ncreate jobs, generate business, or<br />\nboost sales of durable goods<br />\nin Baltimore; rather, the major<br />\ncontributions of the Hopkins<br />\nInstitutions are their social,<br />\nintellectual, and cultural resources. However, the study<br />\ndoes focus on the quantifiable<br />\nimpacts of Hopkins-related activities on three sectors of local<br />\neconomy: business, city govern-<br /><br />\nCommunity News<br />\nState Legislation<br />\nIn an effort to arrest the \"condo craze\" which has permeated much of the Baltimore area, including the Homewood<br />\ncommunity,a Senate subcommittee has pressed for the passage of<br />\nemergency legislation that would tighten the restrictions on<br />\ncondominium conversion.<br />\nThe law, if passed, would require apartment owners to set<br />\naside 20 percent of their rental units for senior citizens and<br />\nhandicapped tenants for three years, pay up to $700 in moving<br />\nexpenses for other tenants, and give current tenants the first<br />\nopportunity to buy the new converted units.<br />\nAmong the other bills that have been introduced during<br />\nthis session is a proposal to make peppermint lemonade the<br />\nofficial state drink, a bill to allow 18 ounce yogurt containers to<br />\nbe sold in Maryland and a bill which according to a brief capsule<br />\nsummary in yesterday's Baltimore Sun would \"allow use of<br />\ncampus by junior and senior undergraduate students\" at the<br />\nUniversity of Maryland,<br /><br />\nment, and individuals.<br />\nThe study reveals that $326<br />\nmillion in expenditures were<br />\ndirectly or indirectly attributable to the Hopkins Institutions<br />\nin Baltimore in 1980, an increase<br />\nof 66 percent over the 1973<br />\ntotal. Included in these institutions are the Johns Hopkins<br />\nUniversity (Homewood Campus:<br />\nFaculty of Arts and Sciences,<br />\nFaculty of Engineering; East<br />\nBaltimore Campus: School of<br />\nHygiene and Public Health,<br />\nSchool of Medicine), Johns<br />\nHopkins Hospital, the Peabody<br />\nConservatory of Music, and the<br />\nBroadway Management Corporation. These institutions are a<br />\nmajor industry in the city's<br />\neconomic base.<br />\nIn 1980, the Hopkins Institutions produced more than<br />\n24,359 jobs in Baltimore. These<br />\njobs generated more than $160<br />\nmillion in personal income and<br />\nnearly $5 million in purchases of<br />\ndurable goods in 1980. These<br />\nfigures rank Hopkins as a major<br />\nemployer in the Baltimore City<br />\nand metropolitan area. In fact,<br />\nthe Hopkins Institutions employ<br />\nmore people than do the city's<br />\ntwo largest department stores, or<br />\nthree largest newspapers, or all<br />\nits commercial banks. Hopkins<br />\nInstitutions were among the<br />\nfastest-growing employers in the<br />\ncity, increasing employment<br />\nfrom 8,000 to nearly 12,000<br />\nbetween 1973 and 1980.<br />\nThough the Johns Hopkins<br />\nUniversity and Hospital are<br />\ntax-exempt, they are responsible<br />\nboth directly and indirectly for<br /><br />\nsizable cash payments to the<br />\ncity. In 1980, Baltimore city<br />\nreceived $11,372,733 in cash<br />\nrevenues from real estate taxes,<br />\nnonreal property tax, state education aid, inspection fees,<br />\nwater, parking tax, and other<br />\nareas.<br />\nThe substantial growth in<br />\nvisitors to the University and<br />\nHospital has also had an impact<br />\non Baltimore's economy. In<br />\n1973, 11,000 visitor days were<br />\nattributed to Hopkins-related<br />\nstaff and activities, while in<br />\n1980, the figure rose to 50,000.<br />\nApproximately $7 million in<br />\nassociated expenditures can be<br />\ntraced to the activities of visitors<br />\nto Hopkins. The largest increase<br />\nin visitors has occured in out-ofstate participants who attend<br />\ncontinuing education seminars at<br />\nthe Medical Institutions. Full<br />\ntime undergraduate and graduate<br />\nstudents at Hopkins spent more<br />\nthan $14 million last year on<br />\ngoods and services in Baltimore.<br />\nThe total number of students at<br />\nthe Hopkins Institutions in 1980<br />\nwas 4,739, up only slightly over<br />\n1973.<br />\nA larger number of<br />\nstudents in 1980 were renting<br />\nhousing in Baltimore city. The<br />\nmedian payment by students<br />\nrenting housing was $160 per<br />\nmonth excluding utilities, more<br />\nthan twice the 1973 amount.<br />\nThe median monthly expenditures of Hopkins students was<br />\nreported to be $121 per month,<br />\nincluding food, books, transportation, and entertainment.<br />\nSince 1976, the Johns<br />\nHopkins University and Hospital<br /><br />\nhave constructed nine major<br />\nbuildings in Baltimore city, at an<br />\naverage cost of more than $10<br />\nmillion each. In addition, $3<br />\nmillion per year has been spent<br />\nto repair and refurbish existing<br />\nbuildings.<br />\nConstruction has<br />\nbegun for the Space Telescope<br />\nScience Institute building, budgeted at $8.9 million. The third<br />\nphase of the Biology Complex is<br />\nalso scheduled for this year, at<br />\n$8 million. These two projects<br />\nwill generate an additional 773<br />\nfull-time construction jobs and<br />\n155 apprenticeships in 1982.<br />\nOn the cost side, the city<br />\nprovided services in 1980 for<br />\nfaculty, staff, and students of<br />\nthe Hopkins Institutions valued<br />\nat more than $30 million. $2.1<br />\nmillion went toward the cost of<br />\npublic education for the children<br />\nof Hopkins faculty, staff, and<br />\nstudents.<br />\nIn general, the study estimates, Institutions-related activities in 1980 generated $243<br />\nmillion of additional business<br />\nvolume in the city; accounted<br />\nfor about $78 million of business real property, equipment,<br />\nand inventories; and generated<br />\nabout $75 million in additional<br />\nbank credit in the city. \"These<br />\nfigures place the Hopkins Institutions among some of the city's<br />\nmost substantial businesses in<br />\nterms of their contribution to<br />\nprivate sector economic activity<br />\nin the city,\" state the authors.<br />\nCopies of the report will be<br />\navailable at the Office of Community Affairs in Merryman<br /><br />\n\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022**\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022*\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022**\u2022**\u2022******\u2022*****************\u2022****\u2022**********<br /><br />\n\u2022 . )B3<br />\nO,<br /><br />\n0oe g<br />\nH 0<br /><br />\neeemeeecemeeeeeecoceociecieeeeeeeeeeecoc)<br />\ne<br />\nin<br /><br />\nProposals for the fall<br /><br />\n*<br /><br />\nMSE Symposium<br />\nare now being accepted<br /><br />\ne!<br />\nO<br /><br />\n\u2022<br />\n\u2022<br />\n\u2022<br /><br />\nE<br />\n\u2022 e 0)7C<br /><br />\nw<br />\nFfil<br /><br />\nCE<br /><br />\nOctecocooeeelecooeoeclewteciecoecielecv,*****8<br /><br />\nin the Student Council Office.<br />\nDeadline is February 19.<br /><br />\n\u2022 Sunday,February '7<br />\n*<br /><br />\n*<br /><br />\na<br />\n*<br />\nAlleGIDGOCOGGIDGGOGGC4DOGGKAD\u2018COGOQGQ4D\u2018GGIDGGOGOGGVIDIDC0OGQ4DQVGGIDGO*<br />\n*<br /><br />\naa 11-1 in the Great Hall<br />\naa<br />\naa<br />\nAdmission is $2.50<br />\naa<br />\na<br /><br />\n*<br /><br />\nMSE Symposium 1<br /><br />\n*<br /><br />\naaa<br />\naa<br />\naaa<br />\naa<br /><br />\n*<br /><br />\nii******Clel0e100(141*******fie,04,041041000C10<br />\n0.1000004100450(,0*(5000,5001<br /><br />\na<br />\na<br />\n:All<br />\nbagels,<br />\nlox<br />\n,<br />\na<br />\na<br />\na<br />\na<br />\ncream<br />\ncheese,<br />\netc.<br />\nAll interested parties should contact :<br />\na<br />\naa<br />\na<br />\nLinda Gurishefsid<br />\na<br />\neat.<br />\n:<br />\ncan<br />\nyou<br />\nat ext8203<br />\nVIC10000C110001,15000000000410000(50*****0000C10410C004,00*(5000000&lt;14<br /><br />\n\u2022 for details on structuring your proposal.<br />\n\u2022<br /><br />\nSPONSORED BY THE J.S.A.<br /><br />\n*************************************************************1<br /><br />\nNEWS-LETTER / PAGE 3<br /><br />\nUniversity Revises Pay Scale<br />\n.intg Salaries<br />\nWithout Rteduc<br /><br />\n44100\u2022ak PAPP.\u2022*--<br /><br />\nA new pay Scale should not affect employees 'salaries.<br /><br />\nBY ROBIN JOHNSONcomparae<br />\ngraded the same between camUniversity employees are puses [Homewood and East<br />\nAnother concern<br />\nstill unsure of how they will be Baltimore]?<br />\ncompetitiveexternal<br />\naffected by the new salary was<br />\nadministration program being ness\u2014are we keeping up with the<br />\nimplemented by the University. market place?\"<br />\nThe University called in an<br />\nA \"slick\" slide show has<br />\nbeen shown by the Personnel outside firm, Hewitt Associates,<br />\nOffice several times on both which specializes in personnel<br />\nand other Johns consultation, and developed a<br />\nHomewood<br />\n*<br />\nHopkins campuses.

An Incriminating Silence<br />\nA small smorgasbord of items for<br />\npraise and complaint this week. First the<br />\npraise:<br />\nCongratulations to Larry Lappin and<br />\nthe Student Council for their apparent<br />\nsuccess in bringing the Ramones, the<br />\npopular punk group, to Hopkins. While<br />\nthese pioneers of the current forms of<br />\n\"angry young men\" music are not necessarily to everyone's .taste, their \"star\"<br />\nmagnitude should ensure th4it the event is a<br />\nfinancial success. Hopkins has a reputation<br />\nas a rotten concert school, and the Ramones concert should prove that such a<br />\nreputation is undeserved and unnecessary.<br />\nFailure in the past has been a result of a<br />\nkind of vicious cycle of negative thinking<br />\namoung Hopkins concert planners: unwilling to spend big bucks on big names for<br />\nfear of insufficient audience turnout, they<br />\nwent for second-rank performers and got<br />\nthe small turnout they were afraid of, thus<br />\nconfirming their own opinion. (Witness<br />\nlast year's Carolyn Mas and Jorma Kaukonen fiascos.)<br />\nOne note of warning: if the $1000<br />\nplus the SC has reportedly spent on improving the sound system in Shriver Hall is<br />\ninsufficient, then the Council should do<br />\neverything short of building a new concert<br />\nhall next door to ensure that things sound<br />\nokay. The sound in Shriver has been<br />\natrocious in the past; last year, it made<br />\nKaukonen's delicate acoustic first set<br />\ncoarse and cloudy, and his hard rock<br />\nsecond set absolutely unbearable.<br /><br />\nLetters to the Editor<br />\n4\u2022115,1<br /><br />\nN-L Mismanagement<br /><br />\nPhoto Staff<br />\nEllen Farina<br />\nLowell Halvorson<br />\nStephanie Kretchmer<br /><br />\nHoward Mertz<br />\nAndy Wolfe<br /><br />\nProductkm Staff<br /><br />\nTo The Editor:<br />\nThere seems to be a problem with the News-Letter. Last<br />\nsemester wrote to Mr. Levine<br />\nabout an article that appeared in<br />\nthe Arts section. It was a<br />\nwell-done review by Dan Vitale<br />\nof the Page Boys, who happen to<br />\nbe Joe Levine and Walter Hook<br />\n(Mr. Hook happens to be the<br />\nArts editor).<br />\nI suggested then that Mr.<br />\nHook was obligated to review<br />\nfuture acts at Chester's Place.<br />\nBut I remind you, it was only a<br />\nsuggestion, a suggestion which<br />\nMr. Hook didn't follow up on.<br />\nThen there was last week's<br />\nissue. In the box on the front<br />\npage, which usually contains the<br />\nsubject of the week's fold, there<br />\nwas an advertisement for Mr:<br />\nHook's play, Blossius of Cumae.<br />\nTurning to page nine, there was<br />\nanother advertisement for the<br />\nplay. And of course, there was<br />\npage nineteen, where there was a<br />\ntwo column advertisement for<br />\nthe .\"swashbuckling\" play. But<br />\nwas there a two-column ad for<br />\nany other campus note? No.<br />\nThen I ask the management<br />\nto allow other campus activities<br />\nto have two-column ads in the<br />\nfuture.<br />\nBut this will never<br />\nhappen.<br />\nSo three ads appeared for a<br />\nplay that wasn't even a schoolaffiliated event. And what's<br />\ntruly amazing is that Mr. Hook's<br />\nplay. company didn't even pay<br />\nfor the ads.<br />\nThat's two strikes against<br />\nthe News-Letter, and especially<br />\nI<br /><br />\nMichael Lorton<br /><br />\nCharles McManus<br />\nLinda Nairn<br />\nAd Production<br /><br />\nAshwin Belur<br />\nHelene Caloir<br /><br />\nAnn Harnwell<br />\nChris Wilde<br />\nCover by<br />\nDana Gillian<br /><br />\nOpinion:<br /><br />\nFrat Week's No Rush<br />\nBY ROBIN JOHNSON<br />\nConversations in the freshman cafeteria have taken on an<br />\nentirely new dimension these<br />\ndays. Picture two tables: one<br />\nfull of feisty freshmen, the<br />\nsecond, bedraggled, exhausted<br />\nhousemasters. The conversation<br />\n:it table one goes something like<br />\nthis:<br />\n\"Hey, man, whatchado last<br />\nnight?\"<br />\n\"I went to Tequila Tuesday<br />\nand I threw up all over the stairs<br />\nbetween the first and second<br />\nfloor, then I called this Goucher<br />\ngirl that I met at the party, but I<br />\nthrew up on the phone.\"<br />\n\"Good show.\"<br />\nMuch weaker strains are<br />\nheard from table two:<br />\n\"Boy,am I tired!\"<br />\n\u201cwhyr,<br /><br />\n\"I carried three passed-out<br />\nfreshmen to their rooms singlehandedly and then I spent the<br />\nrest of the night at Union<br />\nMemorial while the one from<br />\n306 had his stomach pumped.\"<br />\n\"Oh, the old E.R., I know it<br />\nwell. Was that same slow typist<br />\nat the reception desk? I was<br />\nthere the night before last.\"<br />\nMy purpose is not to<br />\nentertain you with amusing<br />\nhousemaster anecdotes; there's a<br />\nreason why the conversations<br />\nhave taken this recent turn and<br />\nmy purpose is to discuss the<br />\ndetrimental effects of rush, not<br />\nonly on freshmen and housemasters, but on the very institution of fraternities.<br />\nFraternities are supposed to<br />\nbe organizations dedicated to<br />\nbrotherhood.<br />\nThey form a<br />\ncont. on p. 5<br /><br />\nNow the complaint: Once again, the<br />\nUniversity, whether by stupidity or intent,<br />\nis at least giving the impression of acting as a<br />\nhighhanded and arbitrary employer. A<br />\nchange is about to be instituted in both the<br />\nemployee pay-scale system and the employee performance-evaluation system, and<br />\ntypically, the employees are being kept<br />\nlargely in the dark about the specifics of<br />\nhow they will be affected. The administration says that no more than 5 .percent of<br />\nthe employees could suffer a decrease in<br />\npay as a result of a cut in the number of<br />\npay-scales, but it does not say how. Thus<br />\nfar, no one has been given any specific<br />\nfigures on how much a particular employee<br />\npresently making X amount will be making<br />\nunder the new system. A film supposedly<br />\nmeant to 'educate' the employees about<br />\nthe new system dealt only with the old<br />\nsystem, and was described as \"insulting\"<br />\nand \"uninformative.\"<br />\nWhy must the<br />\nUniversity persist in undermining any claim<br />\nit might have to being a progressive employer? - Why can it not reap the obvious<br />\nbenefits of being open with its employees?<br />\nThe atmosphere of stonewall secrecy that<br />\nsurrounds the University's dealings with its<br />\nemployees can only cause many people to<br />\nsuspect the worst, especially given JHU's<br />\ntrack record in employee matters. The<br />\nadministration is always saying it wants to<br />\navoid bad publicity in these matters, but in<br />\nthe end, their silence gives them bad<br />\npublicity\u2014witness the Marge Mareck<br />\ndemonstrations of last year.<br /><br />\nagainst Mr. Hook. One more<br />\nand I'm out of here, because this<br />\nnewspaper is supposed to be a<br />\npaper for the campus and not<br />\nfor a select group of people.<br />\nSteve Eisenberg<br />\nEditor's reply:<br />\nBasically, Steve's got management with its pants down.<br />\nThree free ads were an abuse, no<br />\nmatter how you slice it.<br />\nHowever, Steve's accusations should he somewhat qualified. He says that Blossius was<br />\nnot a school-affiliated event, and<br />\nthis is simply not true. The play<br />\nwas written by an undergraduate<br />\nstudent, sponsored by the Writing Seminars Department, and<br />\nscheduled in the Listening and.<br />\nViewing Room by the Student<br />\nServices Office. It was not,<br />\nhowever, given a budget, and<br />\nthus can he described as a<br />\nschool-affiliated event with no<br />\nmoney. The $200 plus spent on<br />\nthe production came out of<br />\nauthor Walter Hook's pocket.<br />\nIn contrast, the ad space<br />\ngiven Blossius amounted to less<br />\nthan $15\u2014a forgivable donation.<br />\nAgreed, there should not have<br />\nbeen three separate ads, and<br />\nespecially agreed that an ad in<br />\nthe fold box was completely out<br />\nof line, but it is not unreasonable for the News-Letter, at its<br />\ndiscretion, to extend a reasonable amount of charity to an<br />\nunfunded school-affiliated event.<br />\nDoing so does not characterize<br />\nthe N-L as being \"for a select<br />\ngroup of people.\" Had Blossius<br />\nnot been written by the Arts<br />\neditor, it would still have been<br /><br />\nthe recipient of a free ad,<br />\nbecause the N-L supports independent student projects.<br /><br />\nFor A Warm Dorm<br />\nTo the Editor:<br />\nWith our nation's current<br />\neconomic and energy crises, it<br />\nseems a shame that this comfortable and warm University<br />\nbenefits only the select few who<br />\ncan afford its tuition.<br />\nThe steam heat system is<br />\nalmost too efficient in the old<br />\nhalls and auditoriums on campus.<br />\nAt night, while Plant<br />\nOperations may attempt to keep<br />\ndown temperatures, the University remains hot.<br />\nJohns Hopkins is one of the<br />\ncity's largest employers, and has<br />\nalways made a serious effort to<br />\nhelp Baltimore in any way. This<br />\nproposal could be our way of<br />\nhelping poor people who can't<br />\nafford heating in their homes.<br />\nResearch is Fine, but a practical<br />\nuse of our present resources<br />\nwould be a more immediate<br />\nsolution to pressing problems.<br />\nHere is the plan: bring in<br />\ncity people to sleep in the halls<br />\nand classrooms of buildings like<br />\nGilman and Shriver. Hundreds<br />\nof people could sleep in Mudd<br />\nHall's auditorium. Poor people<br />\nwouldn't freeze, and the University's heating system would be<br />\nfully utilized. The program's<br />\nparticipants would naturally<br />\nbring their own bedding, and<br />\nwould be returned to their<br />\nhomes before school started<br />\neach morning.<br />\ncont. on p. 5<br /><br />\nNE WS-1.11-1 R-rPA-GE-5<br /><br />\nFraternity Debate:Are We All Brothers Here?<br />\ncont. from p. 4<br />\nPresident Reagan would<br />\napplaud Johns Hopkins' spirit of<br />\nvolunteerism and goodwill.<br />\nSincerely,<br />\nEmily F. Nye<br /><br />\nThe Bahama Drama<br />\nTo the Editor:<br />\nWith all due respect for<br />\ndifferent opinions, I must express my sorrow at the seeming<br />\nindifference on the part of<br />\ncertain students to much that<br />\nsurrounds our insular campus.<br />\nIn particular, I should like to<br />\naddress the sponsors of the raffle<br />\nfor a sojourn to the Bahamas in<br />\nthe spring. I would never raise<br />\npublic objection to individual<br />\nplans for such a visit. However,<br /><br />\nRush<br /><br />\ncont. from p. 4<br />\nbuilt-in peer group for students<br />\nonce they're forced off campus,<br />\nand provide for organized social<br />\nactivities. This is what they<br />\nadvertise in the propaganda<br />\nbooklet distributed to all freshmen. And to tell the truth, I<br />\nbelieve that it does (sort of)<br />\n\u2022fulfill these functions for many<br />\nof the upperclassmen that I<br />\nknow.<br />\nWhat I object to is the<br />\nmethod that has been resorted<br />\nto for recruiting new members<br />\nto perpetuate these organizaThere is something<br />\ntions.<br />\ndistinctly unbrntherly about the<br />\ndestruction that goes on during<br />\nrush\u2014 destruction to property,<br />\npersonal health and self-esteem.<br />\nAnd where in the definition of<br />\nbrotherhood does misogyny<br />\ncome in? Stripper parties and<br />\nhooker raffles (yes, it's just<br />\nwhat it sounds like) teach<br />\nfreshmen contempt for women,<br />\ncontempt for themselves and<br />\nleaves little room for respect for<br />\nthe entire fraternity system.<br />\nRush has gotten out of<br />\nhand. The whole two weeks is<br />\nso obviously colored green and<br />\nprefaced with a dollar sign that<br />\nit's undermining the ideal of<br />\nfraternity and brotherhood. I<br />\npropose that various Hopkins<br />\nfrats seriously consider restructuring the activities upon which<br />\nrush is based. Perhaps the high<br />\nlevel of enthusiasm generated<br />\namong brothers in the quest for<br />\nnew members (and the money<br />\nthey bring in dues) can be<br />\nchanneled into bigger and better<br />\ncommunity-oriented activities.<br />\nSomething like the Phi Psi<br />\n500 race earlier in the semester<br />\nwould be preferable to luring<br />\nfreshmen to frat parties by<br />\nadvertising free Alabama Slammers and kahlua milkshakes. It<br />\nis very irresponsible (not to<br />\nmention illegal) to ply freshmen<br />\nwith hard liquor.<br />\nBut if the fraternities don't<br />\nheed this warning, there has<br />\nalready been a recent crackdown<br />\nby the Inter-Fraternity Council<br />\nand the University Administration that has led to one fraternity already being suspended<br />\nfrom participating in this year's<br />\nrush. Look at the indicators and<br />\nplan accordingly.<br /><br />\nI find it callous for a responsible<br />\norganization to offer this vacation as a prize.<br />\nSome who have always led a<br />\ncomfortable life may not understand my dismay. But others<br />\nwho are sympathetic to the<br />\neconomic conditions and feelings of humiliation felt by the<br />\nservants of a tourist economy<br />\nwho must cater to visitors<br />\ntrampling over their land in<br />\nsearch of the exotic and intoxicating may better understand<br />\nme. Are we no more sensitive<br />\nthan those young couples who<br />\nused to take tea by the pyramids<br />\nor shoot peacocks in an earlier<br />\nage? - I sincerely hope we can<br />\nfind better ways to celebrate the<br />\nreturn of spring.<br />\nSincerely<br />\nV.

As you<br />\nmay recall, the president of the<br />\nWomen's Center wrote a letter<br />\nof protest to the N-L, citing the<br />\nposter as degrading to and<br />\nexploitive of women, using the<br />\nfemale form to advertise a frat<br />\nparty.

The<br />\nmore recent causes of the<br />\nguerilla rebellion are twofold:<br /><br />\nthe climate of rising expectations, and fraudulence. From the<br />\nmid-1950's until the oil crisis of<br />\n1973, El Salvador experienced<br />\nunprecedented growth -for a<br />\ncentral American nation. Thus,<br />\npeople's expectations of continuing prosperity were aroused.<br />\nThe lower middle classes suffered the most, as their wages<br />\nwere highly susceptible to the<br />\ndevastating effects of inflation<br />\nand recession.

This guide does not attempt to change the<br />\nstudent's natural constitution, but helps to recognize<br />\nthe symptoms of typical mental oscillation and offers<br />\nconstructive ways to treat these symptoms.<br />\nI have organized this self-help guide into three<br />\nDepression, Loneliness, and Boredom.<br />\ndivisions:<br /><br />\nDepression<br />\nDepression is quite common among students.<br />\nWhat causes depression: Schoolwork is one of the<br />\nmajor causes, as are a recent failure, a physical defect,<br />\nand television watching. Some television watchers find<br />\nthe news conducive to depression, but I find The Love<br />\nBoat invariably depressing. Symptoms of depression<br />\ninclude listlessness, increased or extremely decreased<br />\nappetite, sadness, insatiable desire to sleep, avoidance<br />\nof one's friends, and the playing of certain \"sad\" songs.<br />\nIn a recent survey at a Hopkins party, favorite songs to<br />\naccompany depression included pieces by Keith<br />\nJarrett, Judy Collins, and Pink Floyd, and Hank<br />\nWilliams'\"I'm So Lonesome I Could Cry.\"<br />\nMost people don't realize the enormous energy<br />\ninvolved in thorough depression. For people interested<br />\nin serious depression, three degrees of intensity may be<br />\nfound. Mild depression is constant in some individuals,<br />\nand manifests itself in continual low-key sadness and<br />\nthe use of sarcasm (see \"Silent Sarcastic Retort\"),<br />\nwhich is an effective social defense. Moderate depression requires isolation, self-pity, consumption of<br />\n\"mother foods\"(See \"Mother Foods\"), disorientation,<br />\nand psychological scabbiness. Total depression is a<br />\ntrue art, and, when executed by professionals, saps all<br />\npersonal energy, cuts off outside help, and creates what<br />\nI like to call The Basket-Case Senior.<br />\nOften, friends try to \"cheer up\" the victim of<br />\ndepression, but I maintain that this is not the answer.<br /><br />\n\"Don't ever let anyone cheer you up,\" I recommend to<br />\nmy acquaintances. My method of dealing with this<br />\nmental debilitation is called:<br /><br />\nCreative<br />\nDepression<br />\nCreative depression strives to channel negative,<br />\nself-defeating energy into productive behavior. The<br />\nidea is not to divert one's attention from the problem,<br />\nbut to come into contact with one's own \"dark side\"<br />\nwhile engaging in some form of positive physical<br />\nactivity. Cleaning the apartment or house is one<br />\nexcellent example of Creative Depression, as are<br />\ngreasing hinges, fumigating, changing car oil, painting,<br />\nbathing pets, and plunging toilets. Part of the therapeutic value of this activity is in realizing that even in<br />\ndepression, the student can function in \"normal\"<br />\nsociety. This builds confidence.<br />\nPhysically unmotivated students may prefer<br />\nintellectual modes of enjoying Creative Depression.<br />\nMemorizing has been found to be a valid form of<br />\nexpressing and enjoying depression to its fullest. Try<br />\nmemorizing poetry. One of my favorite depression<br />\nmemorization exercises is the last part of \"Casey at<br />\nthe Bat\":<br />\nThe sneer is gone from Casey's lips, his teeth<br />\nare clenched in hate.<br />\nHe pounds with cruel vengeance his bat upon<br />\nthe plate;<br />\nAnd now the pitcher holds the ball, and now he<br />\nlets it go,<br />\nAnd now the air is shattered by the force of<br />\nCasey's blow.<br />\nOh, somewhere in this favored land the sun is<br />\nshining bright,<br />\nThe band is playing somewhere,and somewhere<br />\nhearts are light;<br />\nAnd somewhere men are laughing, and somewhere children shout,<br />\nBut there is no joy in Mudville\u2014Mighty Casey<br />\nhas struck out!<br />\nDepression time is also a good time to note<br />\nsong lyrics Which have never before been clear. Slow<br />\ndown and stop the needle. One student discovered the<br />\nBee Gee's hit was really called \"More Than a Woman\"<br />\nand not \"Four-Legged Woman.\"<br />\nNostalgia Theory is another helpful method in<br /><br />\nThe time the surfer,landed on the island<br />\nThe time the castaways found a gold mine<br />\nThe witch doctor episode<br />\nHarold Hecubah and \"Hamlet\"<br />\nThe Russian Astronauts<br />\nThe arrival of the \"Mosquitoes\"<br />\nWrong-way Feldman<br />\nGinger's look-alike<br />\nThe headhunters<br />\n00C1<br />\nMake Way for the Ducklings<br />\nCurious George<br />\nBlueberries for Sal<br />\nGreen Eggs and Ham<br />\nWhistle for Willie<br />\nAre You My Mother?<br />\nCapsfor Sale<br />\nLittle Bear<br />\nBread and Jam for Frances<br />\nCecily G. and the 9 Monkeys<br />\nIf constructive, passive activity does not alter<br />\ndepression, a more physical outlet is usually the<br />\nanswer, which is apparent in a technique I call:<br /><br />\nAcceptable<br />\nHostility<br />\nWhen constructive therapy fails, destruction is<br />\nthe solution. Anger is a commbn way to vent depression, and hostility can also be used to ease tension. I<br />\nstress \"acceptable\" hostility because the root of much<br />\nviolence comes through unacceptable hostility. Learning to express hostility in harmless ways makes violence<br />\na healthy and useful release. Here are some possibilities<br />\nfor acceptable hostility:<br />\nMake a collage, using magazines or family<br />\nphotographs<br />\nBreak raw eggs in hand, over the sink<br />\nWrite bad wishes and fears on paper and burn<br />\nthe paper (Something my family does every year on<br />\nNew Year's Eve. We call it \"Burning the Bad.\")<br /><br />\n\\<br />\n\u2018\u2018XVIMMVI\\<br />\n.vA,\u2018,\\ft\"W\\'W\u2018x\u2022'1/4\u2018X\\VIEVIII\\<br /><br />\nMother Foods<br />\nOreos and milk<br />\nChicken soup<br />\nTapioca pudding<br />\nJello and ginger ale<br />\nPastina with warm milk and sugar<br />\nPhyllis' stuffed cabbage (See Molly Goldberg<br />\nJewish Cookbook)<br />\nSlightly melted ice-cream, any flavor<br />\nChocolate, especially Toblerone.<br />\nAvoid<br />\nNestles: they kill babies.<br />\nBaked Chicken<br />\nOver-cooked green vegetables<br />\nSoft boiled eggs<br />\nOrange juice<br />\nRice<br />\nApplesauce<br />\nSpinach and liver<br />\nPopsicles<br />\nToast and jelly<br /><br />\nHealth<br />\nRoach abuse<br />\nScream underwater (bathtub or swimming<br />\npool)<br />\nThe Silent Sarcastic Retort (SSR\u2014See introduction) is related to Acceptable Hostility, although it<br />\nalso fits under the category of Necessary Repression.<br />\nThe SSR is not the most recommendable way of<br />\nhandling depression, but can be useful in extreme cases<br />\nwhen it is important to act out hostilities while remaining socially acceptable. For example, human stupidity<br />\nis very obvious to people suffering from depression.<br />\nRather than offend an innocent observer, a silent,<br />\nsarcastic retort brings a touch of humor to the situation, while keeping the depressed person as inoffensive<br />\nas possible. Here are a few practice examples of SSR.<br />\nTry them out with friends:<br />\nAt a bus stop: \"Are you waiting for the bus?\"<br />\nSSR:<br />\nOn the morning of an exam: \"Are you ready?\"<br />\nSSR:<br />\nAt Eddie's, after spending $40.00 on two bags<br />\nof groceries: \"Will that be all?\"<br />\nSSR:<br />\nAfter an exam: \"Whudya get?\"<br />\nSSR:<br /><br />\nLoneliness<br />\nDepression is not the only symptom of unstable<br />\nmental health. Loneliness is an unavoidable condition<br />\nwhich many people mistake for depression. Ways to<br />\nrecognize real loneliness include listening to the radio<br />\nand television at the same time, talking aloud to<br />\noneszlf, paranoia, and invisibility. Severely lonely<br />\npeople think they are shrinking or expanding freakishly.<br />\nWhat can ease loneliness? First, learn to think<br />\nof it in a positive light. There is a Spanish refrain<br />\nwhich says, \"Mas vale andar solo clue mal<br />\nacompanado,\" which means,\"It is better to walk alone<br />\nthan to be badly accompanied.\" In other words, it's<br />\nbetter to spend time alone than with someone who<br />\ncheapens one's existence. Quality loneliness focuses on<br />\ntime spent alone. It ceases to look at time as a segment<br />\nof misery, a countdown to solitude. Every second of<br />\nQuality Loneliness is a challenge to see how well the<br />\nstudent can tolerate living with him or herself. Time<br />\nloses its sequential arrangement and becomes a Picasso<br />\ncollection of fragmented moments. The mind is expected to wander, to move ahead and backward, to enjoy<br />\nnot having to share, act, or compromise because of<br />\nhuman social obligation.<br />\nI have compiled a short list of Quality Loneliness situations which may serve as guidelines for the<br />\nstudent testing his or her ability to deal with loneliness:<br />\nIt is better to spend a Thursday night writing<br />\nletters on C-Level than to go to the Rat.<br />\nIt is better to watch reruns of Three's Company<br />\nand Barney Miller than to see Weekend WonderFlix'<br />\nCasablanca for the sixth time. Many college students<br />\nthink it is their moral obligation to see Casablancaand<br />\nother old films, so that they can say, \"I saw that old<br />\nfilm in college.\" This is a fallacy.<br /><br />\nIt's better to shoot baskets alone than to be<br />\npeer-pressured into a game of BIA basketball because<br />\nsome team is short one player.<br />\nIt is better to cross St. Paul Street and walk<br />\nalone than to meet an acquaintance who talks GPA and<br />\nis a nose-picker besides.<br />\nIt is better to do laundry alone than to compromise one's solitude by attending a class dance in the<br />\nGlass Pavilion which features flat beer and old faces.<br /><br />\nBoredom<br />\nFinally, in this brief sketch of mental health<br />\nproblems and treatments for students, boredom must<br />\nbe examined. Boredom is among the commonest of<br />\nhealth nuisances, and is to be blamed for both obnoxious and listless behavior.<br />\nWhat are signs of boredom'? Nail biting, procrastination, listlessness, repetition, depression and<br />\nloneliness are unmistakable signs of boredom. If you<br />\nlearn to recognize these symptoms, sanity is possible.<br />\nFortunately, boredom is easy to cure. Just as in<br />\ndepression and loneliness, creativity plays an important<br />\npart in dealing with boredom. The following is a list of<br />\ndeterrents for boredom.<br />\nPut on make-up. Take it off.<br />\nRearrange your room. Dangle pencils in your nostrils.<br />\nTake the No. 3 bus to Towson and back<br />\nGo downtown and ride the glass elevators in the<br />\nHyatt Regency<br />\nClimb to the roof of McCoy and hang out<br />\nthere.<br />\nSkip pebbles in the President's Pond.<br />\nWrite amusing letters to the editor of the<br />\nNews-Letter<br />\nDesign a septic tank<br />\nBuy M&amp;Ms and segregate them. Eat them color<br />\nby color.<br />\n'Watch T.V. at the Grad Club.<br />\nGo to WaWa\u2014they scoop potato salad as well as<br />\nthey cut cold meat.<br />\nBother friends who are trying to study in the<br />\nlibrary.<br />\nother the bureaucrats in your favorite University<br />\noffice. I like the Placement Office the best.<br /><br />\nDiet and exercise are essential. An old refrain<br />\nsays, \"Bowels that move make a sane thinker.\" One<br />\ntrick for foolproof regularity is called \"The Human<br />\nEnema.\" In this diet, you may eat as many meals as<br />\nyou like, but dessert should be a bowl of bran cereal.<br />\nDrink lots of water. Explosive results, and plenty of<br />\nguaranteed sane thinking.<br />\nEveryone knows how hard it is to make time to<br />\ngo to the gym. The squash courts are often full, and in<br />\nthe pool the lanes are usually crowded. Many people<br />\nfall into a dangerous rut called Recreation for Minimal<br />\nEnjoyment.<br />\nThere are forms of enjoyable and convenient<br />\nexercise that are out of the mainstream. Sweating, for<br />\nexample, may not be aerobic dancing, but is a valid<br />\nform of sedentary activity. Dress warmly and go watch<br />\na swim meet in the gym. Do not shed garments.<br />\nAfterwards, go outside and roll in the snow. Another<br />\nexercise idea is bowling. Believe it or not, there is a<br />\nbowling alley in the gym, although the pins don't reset<br />\nautomatically. Ask at the cage. The library is yet<br />\nanother source of exercise. Pretend the elevator is<br />\nbooby-trapped and you can only use the stairs. Pretend the same person who booby-trapped the elevator<br />\nis chasing you through book stacks.<br />\nUniversity housing is a perfect opportunity for<br />\nstudents to form health clubs. A Wolman Hall Club<br />\nmight partake in the following workout: start in the<br />\nbasement with a stretching session; do three wind<br />\nsprints up and down the hall;jog from the basement to<br />\nthe sixth floor; run across the sixth floor to the opposite side of the building; jog down to the fifth floor;<br />\nzig-zag down to the basement again. Repeat twice.<br />\nIf University Housing health clubs don't appeal,<br />\njoin ROTC. Running in army boots appears to be a<br />\nvigorous way to train, and it can never hurt to know<br />\nhow to scale a barbed wire fence.<br />\n(cont. on p. 13)<br /><br />\nThese suggestions have helped me a great deal<br />\nthrough college, and even through high school. I do<br />\nnot claim to be \"normal,\" or even sane, but I function<br />\non a semi-adult level, which deserves some credit.<br />\nNotice that these guidelines do not prescribe drugs or<br />\nalcohol, although narcotics and inebriants may also be<br />\neffective ways to deal with depression, loneliness, and<br />\nboredom.<br />\nRemember to appreciate and utilize positive<br />\nmental facilities, and never forget the words of Virginia<br />\nWoolf:<br />\nThe depression, however, now takes the wholesome form of feeling perfectly certain that nothing I<br />\ncan do matters, so that one is both content and irresponsible\u2014I'm not sure that this isn't a happier state<br />\nthan the exalted state of the newly praised.<br /><br />\nGraphics by'<br /><br />\nCliff Harris &amp; Iromie Weeramantry<br /><br />\nPAGE 12/ FEBRUARY 5,1982<br /><br />\nIMMIGRATION<br /><br />\n---\"--fi a-ir Cutting<br />\nF &amp;Design<br />\nst t-v\u2014 \u20147<br />\nor Men<br />\nomen<br /><br />\nPROBLEMS<br /><br />\nCALL<br />\n332-4150<br /><br />\n4<br />\nii.\u2022<br />\n\u20224<br />\nN. .<br />\n100<br /><br />\nU.S. visa petitions and appeals<br />\nLabor certifications<br />\nDefense against deportation<br />\nRelative petitions<br />\nU.S. citizenship<br /><br />\nPizza<br />\nHot and Cold Subs<br />\nSouviaki<br />\nGyros<br /><br />\n235-7083<br />\nSpecial Student Rate - with ID<br /><br />\nBlaustein Building<br />\nOne north Charles Street<br />\nBaltimore<br />\nMaryland<br />\n2 1 201<br /><br />\n_...... \u2014<br /><br />\n_.ANNA\u2022<br /><br />\nI,<br /><br />\nTHE<br /><br />\nDaily: 10 AM -2 AM<br />\nPhone ahead : 467 - 1022<br /><br />\nBIRD<br />\nIS<br /><br />\n\"BestPicture ofthe Year!\"<br />\nNational Board of Reviews<br /><br />\nJim Brown NBC-TV<br /><br />\n\"One ofthe Year's 10 Best!\"<br />\nTime Magazine<br />\nL A Times<br />\nGene Shalit Today Show<br />\nJudith Cris!<br />\nRex Reed<br />\nAssociated Press<br />\nPeople Magazine<br />\nNew York Daily News<br /><br />\nTHE<br />\nWORD<br /><br />\nif,1<br />\n1<br /><br />\nI,<br /><br />\nIb,<br /><br />\nT i no's Lunch<br /><br />\n1<br /><br />\nr<br /><br />\nMonument and Chester Streets It<br />\nAL,<br />\n732-6733<br />\n1<br />\nr<br />\nTHE PEABODY\u2014HOPKINS SERIES<br />\nTHE PEABODY FLUTE ENSEMBLE<br />\nBonnie Lake, director<br />\nPresented by<br />\nThe Johns Hopkins University<br />\nOffice of Special Events<br />\nTHURSDAY,FEBRUARY 11,1982,12 NOON<br /><br />\n'<br /><br />\nGarrett Room<br />\nMilton S.

STEINER<br />\nThe Baltimore Museum of Art is<br />\nfeaturing a collection of early photographs from the archives of the Royal<br />\nPhotographic Society of Great Britain.<br />\nThe Royal Photographic Society, which<br />\nwas founded in 1853 as \"The Photographic Society,\" possesses a collection of<br />\nover twenty thousand prints and negatives. Under the direction of Sir Tom<br />\nHopkinson, and through the auspices of<br />\nthe International Exhibitions Foundation, roughly one hundred works have<br />\n\u201e<br /><br />\nbeen selected to tour North American<br />\nmuseums.<br />\nThe collection, which will be on<br />\nexhibit until Feb. 28, occupies both<br />\nrooms of the museum's Kenneth S..<br />\nBattye Gallery. Spanning the years 1842<br />\nto 1936, the photographs represent a<br />\nwide range of both studio and outdoor<br />\nportraits, architectural studies, landscape<br />\ntableaus and genre scenes. Included in<br />\nwhat has been termed his very \"personal\"<br />\nand \"representative\" selection, Sir<br />\nHopkinson has managed to capture both<br />\nthe characteristically wispy and somewhat impressionistic style of early British<br />\n-<br /><br />\nphotography, as well as the more crisp<br />\nand refined forms of what we would now<br />\nconsider to be the styles of Ansel Adams<br />\nor Edward Weston.<br />\nAlthough a good many of the<br />\nphotographers represented do not usually<br />\nappear in North American exhibits, one<br />\nname in the collection, that of Alfred<br />\nStieglitz, stands out. Stieglitz, perhaps<br />\none of the most significant figures in the I<br />\nformative years of professional photography is represented in this collection by<br />\nthree photographic gems.

Mimi asks her, \"When do<br />\nyou get a change?\" Simone confesses,<br />\n\"Here, with you.\" This genuinely moving<br />\nscene reveals to the audience why<br />\nGrumberg is showing us their lives in the<br />\nworkroom; it is the companionship<br />\n(however strained it may be) between<br />\nthese women which is as crucial a part ot<br />\ntheir existence as their home life. The\u2022<br />\nworkroom is not lost time; it's what their<br />\nlives are all about. This distressing<br />\nyet touching reality shows the other Blossius<br />\nwomen that the community between<br />\nthem is crucial to their happiness.

Despite Mimi's<br />\nraucous sexual jokes and playful mockery<br />\nof the boss and other workers, Simone<br />\nstill often sinks into fits of crying.<br />\nThere are ten scenes, all taking<br />\nplace in the Workroom,and between each<br />\nscene a year or so has elapsed. The<br />\nchanges from year to year are subtle.<br />\nGrumberg's point is that their lives don't<br />\nchange much. For at least five years<br />\nSimone is trying to get her husband's<br />\ndeath certificate so she can get a pension.<br />\nMarie gets married and has a child, but<br />\nher life in the workroom stays the same.<br />\nThe lights change from G.E. -60 watt<br />\nbulbs to fluorescent tubes. The fear that<br />\nhaunts the Jewish characters(Simone, her<br />\nboss Leon, his wife Helene, and the<br />\nominous first pressman) only slowly<br />\nfades. Laurence, year after year, gets the<br />\nseat by the window. When the economy<br />\nis bad, Leon becomes bossy and nasty to<br />\ncover up his guilt, but Mimi still calls him<br />\n\"the monkey,\" and beneath his hard shell<br />\nhe is still a marshmallow.<br />\nL 'Atelier is realism carried to the<br />\npoint where dramaturgical form (rising<br />\naction, climax) is sacrificed. The slowness and slightness of the changes in these<br />\npeople's lives is part. of the distressing<br />\nreality Grumberg wishes to portray. But<br />\nsomething very significant does happen to<br />\nthe women over the years.<br />\nThroughout the play, one has a<br />\nsense that through their lives in the<br />\nwokroom stay pretty much the same,<br />\ntheir lives outside the workroom are<br />\nrollicking along. Grumberg seems to be<br />\nshowing us the dull half of their lives.<br /><br />\n/\\IR 1 51<br /><br />\nAmbitious or Overambitious?<br /><br />\nPAGE 16/ FEBRUARY 5,1982<br /><br />\nEmpty Barn<br /><br />\nBlossius Incites Audience To Revolt In LN Room<br />\ncont. from p. 15<br />\nThe- development of the first act<br />\nof the play, which is too complicated to<br />\nexplain here (although easily comprehensible in the theater), moves steadily<br />\nalong toward the rising action and the<br />\nclimax. The audience participation adds<br />\na great sense of fun and an additional<br />\nsense of closeness to the performers, thus<br />\nengaging the audience more immediately<br />\nin the drama.<br />\nJoe Levine is excellent as the<br />\nMacbeth-like Tunis, the son-in-law who<br />\nslays the King to gain power (for the<br />\ngood of the people, of course), and Rey<br />\nMuradaz is equally good as the troubled<br />\nson of the King and erstwhile best friend<br />\nof the traitor Tunis. Both actors give<br />\ndepth and credibility to their characters.<br />\nThe production transcends the<br /><br />\ndifficulty of numerous scene changes<br />\nwith good use of an adaptable set, props,<br />\nlights, and special effects. In addition, all<br />\nthe costumes are reasonably authentic<br />\nand the make-up well done.<br />\nIn the first act, the scenes are<br />\ngenerally good and the growing conflicts<br />\ninteresting.

Mimi(Susan Sharkey), who runs<br />\naway from uncomfortable situations<br />\nthrough humor, was portrayed with an<br />\nunnatural stiffness which I found disturbing. Leon (Larry Block) the boss, was<br />\nalways animated, but slurred his words,<br />\nand his characterization was better suited<br />\nto television sitcoms than to serious<br />\ndrama.- William Jensen's haunting portrayal of the first presser, a Jew who<br />\nsurvived the war, was touching, and left<br />\nme wanting to know more about him.<br />\nStudent rush tickets from $6 to<br />\n$10; regular tickets, from $10 to $15.<br />\nL'Atelier is not an evening of light<br />\nentertainment by any means\u2014only for<br />\nthe intellectually intrigued.<br /><br />\nlent film, surprisingly enough, knowing<br />\nthis series, based on the novel by Gunter<br />\nGrass. Too bad it has to be seen in<br />\nShaffer 3.<br /><br />\nAt the start of Act II, the plot<br />\nthickens, as subplot after subplot devolves upon the main plot, all involving<br />\nBlossius,<br />\ndeviousness and treachery.<br />\nStoic philosopher, marshals much of the<br />\naction in the subplots, hut his constant<br />\ninvolvement throughout the play is kept<br />\nin proportion by many slight authorial<br />\ndigs, as when someone asks Blossius,\"Are<br />\nyou making this up as you go along?\"<br />\nUnfortunately, as the plot becomes more complicated, the play begins<br />\nto deteriorate. The scene changes continue to be unnecessarily numerous and<br />\nbecome annoying. While the action picks<br />\nup, the script seems overly long in places.<br />\nThe play still holds its own,however; the<br />\nGuards One and Two lend a humorous<br />\ntouch with their vacillating loyalties and<br />\ndevious maneuverings. There is also a<br />\nnice bit of physical slapstick when<br />\nBlossius attempts to hide behind a barrel<br />\nwhile Tunis has a rendezvous with a<br />\nRoman captain, who is outstandingly<br />\nportrayed by Donald Gordon.<br />\nHowever, as the action escalates<br />\nand the consequences of the various<br />\nsubplots begin to manifest themselves,<br />\nthe play begins slipping into melodrama.<br />\nIt seems that everything converges at<br />\nonce and we are bombarded with attempted slaughters, liberations, imprisonments, more slaughters, and so on. The<br />\nKing's daughter Synae, played by<br />\nSuzanne Conklin, cries \"All is lost!\" and<br />\nwith this soap-operatic statement the play<br />\nalmost loses us as well. A swordfight<br />\nensues between the enemy armies; this<br />\nscene was summed up by one of the<br />\naudience who whispered,\"Oh well, stage<br />\nfencing's tough.\" Then, of course, the<br />\nbattle ends with nearly everyone dying or<br />\nabout to die, and we move into the<br />\nEpilogue.

If you do not become the<br />\nauthors of your own scripts when you<br />\ndislike what the script says, this play is<br />\ndoomed to have a tragic ending.\" And<br />\nthen the audience script reads, \"Guilty. .<br />\nDeath!\"<br />\nBut Hook/Blossius (or Blossius/<br />\nHook?) was so convincing that, at least at<br />\nthis performance, despite the scripted<br />\nending there was great audience dissent,<br />\nand, put to audience vote, Blossius was<br />\nacquitted, breaking with the \"real\"<br />\nending of the play. This ending, while<br />\nposing a fascinating dilemma (does one,<br />\nlike a soldier, simply follow the script, or<br />\norders, in spite of one's beliefs?), seems<br />\nactually to be a wishy-washy ending. It<br />\nunfairly takes the responsibility for the<br />\nconsequences of Blossius' actions from<br />\nthe author's shoulders and puts it onto<br />\nthe audience's. This is essentially a clever<br />\ncopout for the author.<br />\nNevertheless, Blossius of Cumae<br />\ndoes have its merits.

Nevertheless, eight straight points by the<br />\nBears gave Ursinus its first lead<br />\nof the game. The lead switched<br />\nhands six times as Ursinus took a<br />\n39-37 halftime lead.

The Jays,<br />\nplaying shoddy defense and<br />\nshooting poorly, quickly fell<br />\nfrom striking distance. A 174<br />\nspurt by Ursinus gave the Bears a<br />\n73-69 lead. Most of the points<br />\ncame from the charity line, as<br />\nHopkins, trying to catch up, was<br />\nforced to foul.
