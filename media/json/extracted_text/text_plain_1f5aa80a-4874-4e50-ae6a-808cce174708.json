Davis, associate professor of<br />\ngynecology and obstetrics at the Johns Hopkins<br />\n<br />\nHospital and one of the developers of an<br />\ninter-uterine device in current birth-control use,<br />\ndiscussed his recent work towards the<br />\nelimination of cervical cancer.<br />\nDr. Davis, said that the incidence of cervical cancer<br />\namong women today can be controlled and that this can<br />\nbe accomplished relatively easily. The disease can be<br />\ndetected while in the developmental stages before it does<br />\nanY permanent damage. A woman can find out if she<br />\nhas the disease by having a \"pap smear test,\" designed to<br />\ndetect cervical cancer.<br />\n,<br />\nIf the disease is detected in early stages, before it<br />\nbecomes cancerous, it can be cured with minor surgery.<br />\nin an advanced stage at the time of detection,<br />\nnowever, the process for recovery is more complicated<br />\nand slightly less reliable. \"The advanced, fullblown<br />\ncancer is generally treated by radiation,\" said Dr. Davis.<br />\nDepending upon the stage of the cancer, it can still be<br />\ncLontained in about 85% of cases. \"If it has spread<br />\n\u00b0,eYond the cervix then the cure rate will drop down to<br />\n4% or less,\" depending upon the degree of<br />\nadvancement, he<br />\nexplained.<br />\nThe surgery involved in curing the early stages of<br />\nthe disease is very simple and local in nature. When<br />\ncaught in the developmental stages it is curable with<br />\ncomplete dependability in all cases. Cervical cancer is the<br />\ncolY common malignancy that is 100% curable when<br />\ntreated in a premature stage.<br />\nDr. Davis described the cancer as a \"mutant cell<br />\ncolony- that has some biological advantage over the<br />\nnormal cells, growing and replicating and gradually<br />\ntaking over more and more tissue until they compromise<br />\nvital functions.\"<br />\nWhen asked about research in connection with<br />\n<br />\nvaccinations to prevent cervical cancer, Dr. Davis said<br />\nthat there is some evidence that something might be<br />\ndeveloped but that it is still very much in the<br />\nformulating stages.<br />\nThe cervical cancer research has been conducted<br />\nwithout the aid of the federal government. All the<br />\nmoney came from private sources and the Maryland<br />\nDivision of the American Cancer Society.<br />\nContraceptive Research<br />\nDr. Davis has also done extensive research on<br />\ninter-uterine devices. He, along with assistants from the<br />\nHopkins Hospital, has developed a device for women<br />\nwho have not yet been pregnant. This work began about<br />\nfive years ago with a gift of money from a local source<br />\nwho was particularly concerned about contraceptive<br />\nmeans. The program has been continued with funds<br />\nfrom the Population Council in New York City, other<br />\nprivate gifts, and finances from the University.<br />\nHis work has also extended beyond the realms of<br />\nresearch; he has supported family planning and has<br />\ninduced the hospital to put a family planning nurse on<br />\nthe staff. The nurse's function is to give aid and<br />\ninformation about planning to patients.<br />\n\"I have never applied for or received one cent of<br />\nfederal money since I was discharged from the army,\"<br />\nDr. Davis said. He explained that Federal grants are<br />\ndifficult to get unless there is a specific project with<br />\nwhich an individual is concerned that is alos of interest<br />\nto the government.<br />\nNo Federal Money<br />\nDr. Davis said, \"There hasn't been any federal<br />\nmoney available for practical work in contraception.\"<br />\nHe did say, however, that Planned Parenthood has<br />\nreceived money from the Office of Economic<br />\nOpportunity.<br />\nReferring to the dispersal of government monies,<br />\n<br />\nDr. Davis said that at the \"highest level they talk about<br />\nlack of services, but when it comes to getting money to<br />\ntrain nurse-midwives to provide services, you have a hard<br />\ntime getting the financial backing to do this.\" He said<br />\nthat federal money still provides many services to the<br />\nmedical community, but that the help is too specifically<br />\ndirected.<br />\nDr. Davis said that \"a great deal of what is done is<br />\nstill done with a relatively small portion of private<br />\nmoney that is flexible.\"<br />\n<br />\nDR.

The<br />\nq uestion-and-answer period which<br />\n110wed the speech was plagued with<br />\n.tne same problem as two or three<br />\nIn dividuals in the audience of<br />\naPProximately one hundred people<br />\nattempted to deliver separate<br />\n111\u00b0Itologues of their own, rather than<br />\nas<br />\nquestions.<br />\n\u201es In his speech Mr. Masri described<br />\nLe present crisis as resulting from the<br />\nInterplay of \"local forces,\" and said that<br />\nthere could be no permanent peace<br />\nWithout consideration of these forces.<br />\nIle Pointed to the Palestine refugee<br />\nProblem as the most pressing of the<br />\nlocal issues, claiming that Israel's<br />\ntreatment of the people who were<br />\ndisplaced by the 1967 war is one of the<br />\ninain roadblocks to a Mid-East<br />\nsettlement.<br />\nThe Arabs hold that the refugees<br />\nre an Israeli responsibility; that it is up<br />\nr\u0300O Israel, not the Arab states, to arrange<br />\nOr the disposition of these people. Mr.<br />\nMasri attacked Israel for refusin to<br />\n<br />\ndiscuss the refugees except in relation to<br />\na total settlement of the boundary<br />\ndisputes, a position the Arabs find<br />\n\u2022 unacceptable.<br />\nMr. Masri went on to condemn<br />\nIsrael's policies towards Arabs as<br />\n\"expansionist,\" claiming that the<br />\ncountry's policies \"threaten the<br />\nexistence of the territorial imperatives<br />\nof the neighboring states.\" He pointed<br />\nout that although the United Nations<br />\nResolution that officially divided<br />\nPalestine called for the area to be split<br />\nup 56% Israeli and 44% Arab, Israel has,<br />\nthrough warfare, managed to acquire<br />\n80% of the territory. He pictured Israel<br />\nas \"not satisfied with 80%\", and<br />\naccused the country of planning to<br />\nfurther expand its boundaries.<br />\nUnder these conditions the<br />\nspeaker felt that guerrilla activities<br />\nbecome inevitable. He said that the<br />\nArabs could not be expected to accept<br />\nthe Israeli seizure of their land, and that<br />\n\"occupation and resistance go<br />\ntogether.\" He compared the present<br />\nguerrilla attacks to similar actions<br />\nundertaken against the British by the<br />\nHaganah, and underground Zionist<br />\norganization that operated in Palestine<br />\nwhile it was still a protectorate of Great<br />\nBritain. Mr. Masri felt that any peace<br />\nproposals would have to be sanctioned<br />\nby the guerrilla groups to be effective.<br />\n<br />\nTaking Advantage<br />\nMr. Masri referred often to the<br />\npublic supposition that Israel is a<br />\nhelpless country surrounded by massive<br />\nArab strength. He pointed to the 1967<br />\nwar as evidence that the Arab nations<br />\nare, in reality, unable to stand up to the<br />\nIsraelis. He accused Israel of taking<br />\nadvantage of Arab weakness to gain new<br />\nterritory. He defended recent Arab<br />\nmilitary buildup as necessary for<br />\ndefense, adding that although the Arabs<br />\nhad been criticized for shelling Israeli<br />\nkibbutzes, the shells had actually been<br />\ndirected into an area that did not belong<br />\nto Israel and was being farmed against a<br />\nmutual demilitarization agreement.<br />\nMr. Masri said that the Arab<br />\nposition \"is very, very clear.\" They<br />\nwant a solution because \"if there is no<br />\nsolution war will break out again.\" He<br />\nclaimed that the Arabs have shown their<br />\nby Hoffmann willingness to negotiate and that it is<br />\nISRAEL WAS condemned and the Arabs were<br />\nnow up to Israel to choose. \"Territory<br />\nabsolved by Mr. Ham Marsi, Attache of<br />\nor peace-they cannot pursue both at<br />\nJordanian mission,in a speech here.<br />\nthe same time.\"<br />\n<br />\n91 111 4 4<br />\n<br />\n\u202211 1 Jr<br />\n<br />\nAt Homewood Seminar<br />\n<br />\nYehuda Avner, First<br />\nSecretary of the Israeli Embassy,<br />\n<br />\nstated in an informal seminar<br />\noutside Shaffer Hall last Sunday<br />\nthat \"the Big Four Powers are<br />\nmeddling in our affairs for their<br />\nown selfish interests.\"<br />\n\"We can remember the teachings<br />\nof history,\" he said, \"and it has taught<br />\nus that if two countries are in conflict,<br />\nthe only way to solve it is for those<br />\ncountries to sit down together. Those<br />\nwho have something to give and take<br />\nmust just sit down and work it out.\"<br />\nMr. Yehuda had moved the<br />\nlecture outside after only eight people<br />\nappeared. The lecture was originally<br />\nscheduled for Shaffer 3.<br />\n\"There are two points against the<br />\nBig Four conference,\" he said. \"One is<br />\npractice and, the other concerns Israeli<br />\ninterest. If we are to conclude the war,<br />\nwe must sit down with the Arabs.\"<br />\nThe First Secretary noted that<br />\nmany of today's problems may be<br />\nattributed to conflicts settled by<br />\nuninvolved parties.<br />\nMunich is Example<br />\n\"Munich is one example. In the<br />\nname of peace, England sold<br />\nCzechoslovakia to Germany. It was a<br />\nfake, it was false, but history books<br />\nstill tell us so.\"<br />\n\"You see,\" he continued,\"people<br />\nwho are not in the actual conflict just<br />\ndon't realize the implications of their<br />\nactions.\"<br />\nMr. Yehuda cited a second point<br />\nagainst the present Big Four<br />\nConference. \"Who is going to decide the<br />\nfate of Israel? There are four powers,<br />\nFrance, Russia, England and the United<br />\nStates. Russia and France totally<br />\nsupport the Arab countries, everything<br />\nthe Arabs want will be given to them by<br />\nthese two. England is going to the<br />\nconference but England is always sitting<br />\non the fence, and the United States,<br />\nalthough they think we are right, has its<br />\nown policy.<br />\n\"Hence, if there is any give and<br />\nthe conference, Israel will lose'<br />\nat<br />\ntake<br />\nbecause the United States will give<br />\nsomething they think is unimportant<br />\nwhile the others will fight only for the<br />\n<br />\nArabs.<br />\nMr. Yehuda noted that it is<br />\ndifficult to understand the Arab leaders<br />\nbecause they \"speak two languages, one<br />\nto the press and one to their people.\"<br />\nHe noted, as an example, the fact<br />\nIthat last week. Carnal Abdel Nassar,<br />\nPresident of Egypt, said that the only<br />\nsolution to the conflict he would accept<br />\nwas a return to conditions existing<br />\nbefore the Six Day War.<br />\n\"Practical Indications\"<br />\n\"We aren't going to be cheated by<br />\nthe press,\" Yehuda said. \"We think that<br />\n\u2022 the time for peace will come only when<br />\nArabs speak to their people the way<br />\n\u2022 they speak to the press.<br />\nWhen asked about the probable<br />\nconditions for the return of peace to the<br />\nMiddle East situation, Mr. Yehuda said<br />\n'that there must be some practical<br />\nindication of the Arabs' willingness to<br />\nnegotiate. \"We are going to sit down at<br />\na table and we will talk. But now we<br />\nhave something to give them back, we<br />\ncan offer peace and territory.\"<br />\nYehuda lamented the apparant<br />\nhardening of Arab policy. He said that it<br />\nnow looks as if the Arabs are further<br />\naway from a settlement today than they<br />\nwere at the end of the Six Day War.<br />\n\"Maybe it's because the Arabs didn't<br />\nsuffer in World War Two. They didn't<br />\ngo through what the Israeli people went<br />\nthrough. Maybe this is why we<br />\nemphasize peace more than they do.\"<br />\n\"But as much as we want peace,\"<br />\nhe continued,\"we will not just give into<br />\nthem in the name of peace.<br />\nFor purposes of argument,<br />\nYehuda divided the post-1947 era into<br />\ntwo periods: before the 1967 Six Days<br />\nWar, and the after effects of that war.<br />\nHe stated that, previous to the violent<br />\nengagements during the June War, Israel<br />\nhad little to offer in return for peace in<br />\nthe area.<br />\n\"This has all changed now. We can<br />\noffer them land and peace in return for<br />\npeace.\"<br />\nYehuda did state, however, that<br />\nthere are certain fundamental<br />\nconditions which Israel must consider.<br />\n\"We are now in a secure position and I<br />\ndo not think we dare jeopardize that<br />\nposition.\"<br />\n<br />\n\fPAGE 4<br />\n<br />\nHOMEWOOD,BALTIMORE, APRIL 18, 1969<br />\n<br />\nNEWS-LETTER<br />\n<br />\nU. Chicago Warns Against Student Disruptions<br />\nThe University of Chicago \\<br />\nAcademic Senate, in a letter sent<br />\nthis week to students who have<br />\nbeen accepted to its graduate<br />\nschool, warned that attempts to<br />\ndisrupt the University will be met<br />\nwith \"disciplinary action, not<br />\nexcluding expulsion.\"<br />\nIn the \"disruptive category,\" the<br />\nletter included all \"actions which<br />\nattempt to harass or coerce individual<br />\nmembers of the University community<br />\nor actions which deliberately interfere<br />\nwith the University's teaching activities,<br />\nresearch activities, or supportive<br />\nadministrative or operational activities,<br />\nin an effort to coerce . University<br />\ndecisions.\"<br />\n<br />\nThe letter was sparked by a two<br />\nweek sit-in and march on the president's<br />\nhome last February, protesting the<br />\nfiring of a sociology professor. 42<br />\nstudents have been expelled and 81<br />\nsuspended up to two years for<br />\nparticipation in the campus disruptions<br />\n<br />\nhave just been accepted to the<br />\nUniversity of Chicago to refuse that<br />\noffer, to boycott this University in<br />\norder to demonstrate that its present<br />\npolitically repressive policy is as<br />\nintolerable to potential students as it is<br />\nintolerable to present students.\"<br />\n<br />\nParents of disciplined students<br />\nhave joined with a committee of over<br />\n100 faculty members and the student<br />\n\"Committee of 500-Plus\" in denouncing<br />\nthe University actions. 30 New York<br />\nparents sponsored an advertisement in<br />\nthe New York Times entitled: \"Overkill<br />\nat the University of Chicago.\"<br />\nThe \"Committee of 500-Plus\",<br />\nwhich has sponsored a partially effective<br />\nboycott of classes urging \"all those who<br />\n<br />\nThe Committee's letter noted that<br />\nthe sit-in was \"completely<br />\nnon-violent--there was no overt<br />\nvandalism or property damage, files<br />\nwere not disturbed.

After<br />\napproval of the papers, the Greater Homewood<br />\nCorporation will begin to assume the duties of the Greater<br />\nHomewood Project, which will be ended on June 14,<br />\n1969. The project was originally developed by Ross Jones,<br />\nVice President for University affairs and President of<br />\nHECUA.<br />\nThe Corporation will act as a neighborhood information<br />\ncenter, and a clearing house for volunteer services for schools and<br />\nhospitals. It will also provide technical assistance to the resident<br />\npopulation in the areas of zoning, housing code enforcement, and<br />\nhousing rehabilitation.<br />\nCommunity Revitalization<br />\nThe Corporation has a three year $75,000 budget. Funds will<br />\nbe solicited from \"business and industry, churches, foundations,<br />\nindividual residents, institutions and all who would support<br />\ncommunity revitalization,\" states \"Keynotes,\" a Greater Homewood<br />\nProject Publication. The majority of the funds will come from<br />\nindividuals, who will be asked to make a contribution when they<br />\njoin, and Hopkins. The University Board of Trustees has approved in<br />\nprinciple an uncontrolled contribution to the corporation.<br />\n\"The proposal for a corporation was developed after (Greater<br />\nHomewood) Project started in 1966 when Ross Jones, University<br />\nVice President, began talking to people about the changes which had<br />\ntaken place in the Homewood Community since his days here as a<br />\nstudent. When President Gordon agreed that the University ought to<br />\nshare its facilities with the community, the Project began in earnest.<br />\nCommunity Projects<br />\nThe project has created a number of community action<br />\nprojects: a reading and creative arts program at Barclay School, a<br />\nmultiplicity of recreation programs run in cooperation with the City<br />\nDepartment of Recreation, a series of breakfast seminars on topics<br />\nof community interest and a neighborhood spruce up campaign.<br />\nThe Project is being replaced by the corporation \"because\"<br />\nMrs. Kline stated, \"the corporation will .give the Homewood<br />\nCommunity the mechanical ability to do many things we cannot do<br />\nas a project.\"<br />\n<br />\nAccording to the standards set by<br />\nthe Federal government, the extent of<br />\nsegregation in the Baltimore City Schools<br />\nSystem has shown a marked increase over<br />\nthe past year.<br />\nThis year, fourteen additional city<br />\nschools reported that they admitted a<br />\nstudent body which was composed of<br />\neither all black or all white students.<br />\nThe federal government considers a school<br />\nintegrated if the minority group in that given<br />\nschool represents at least 10% of the total<br />\nnumber of students. Using this guideline there<br />\nare 151 segregated schools in the Baltimore area<br />\nthis year. Of these, 75 are entirely segregated.<br />\nThe increase leaves Baltimore with over<br />\n71% of its public schools essentially segregated<br />\nafter almost fifteen years since the United States<br />\nSupreme Court order for the desegregation of<br />\nschools.<br />\nElementary Schools<br />\nOf the totally segregated schools 64 are on<br />\nthe elementary level. This compares with 55<br />\nprimary schools that were entirely of one race<br />\nlast year. Of the total number of essentially<br />\nsegregated schools there are 121 elementary<br />\nschools in this category.<br />\nBaltimore has 192,170 students in the<br />\nschools, 125, 173 of whom are non-white. This<br />\ncompares with an almost one to one ratio of<br />\nwhites to blacks on the faculty level. There are<br />\n4,718 Negro teachers and 4,013 whites.<br />\nThere are 33 faculties in the school system<br />\nthat are totally segregated, a drop of 16 from last<br />\nyears 49. Using the government standard of<br />\n10-90 per cent, however, there are 20 additional<br />\nschools with segregated teacher staffs. Thus there<br />\nare 53 essentially segregated faculties.<br />\nNeighborhood Schools<br />\nThe large number of segregated elementary<br />\nschools is attributed to the fact that most of the<br />\nchildren on that level go to the nearest schools.<br />\nWith most of Baltimore's communities being of<br />\njust one race the schools on the primary level<br />\n<br />\ntend to reflect the color of its environment. Oil<br />\nthe junior high and high school levels the<br />\nstudents have the choice of going to whatevel<br />\nschool in the city they choose.<br />\nThe open enrollment policy that allows<br />\ncity's students to go where they want has led to<br />\novercrowding in some high schools that ate<br />\nconsidered to be a better quality than others.<br />\nThere has been considerable trouble will<br />\novercrowding in three of Baltimore's<br />\nschools. School Superintendent Dr. Robert vj<br />\nSheldon recently suggested that annexes be se;<br />\nup at other high schools in the city where e<br />\nstudent could go for a year before attending tliv,<br />\nactual school of his choice. Francis<br />\nMumaghan, Jr., president of the school boar\u00b0<br />\nrecommended that the annexes be set up at les'<br />\ncongested schools.<br />\nPlan's Success<br />\nThe basis for the plan's success rests 111)\u00b0,s1ti<br />\nthe students being willing to go to a school novoi<br />\nof their choosing but rather another high sch d<br />\nunder the guise of being an annex of the sch\u00b0<br />\nthey do wish to attend.<br />\nOf the 14 schools that are tot,/<br />\nsegregated thirteen became so because of a Slur,<br />\nOf just two or three students. Thus, last yeacie<br />\nthese schools were substantially of one raf,e<br />\naccording to the federal standards. The<br />\nschool, Benjamin Banneker Elementary, that Da ,<br />\nclose to a substantial number of the ininori.t)<br />\nfe<br />\ngroup last year also dropped an entlai<br />\nenrollment. The school, located on East Feder f<br />\nStreet, had 16 whites among its student bodY<br />\n522 in 1967-68. This year the all black scile\u00b0<br />\nhas an enrollment of 140.<br />\nHighlandtown Elementary School, w- 1,<br />\nhad 38 Negroes last year, became extrenll<br />\nsegregated when the number of blacks dropPe<br />\nto three.<br />\nOther schools that have become took'<br />\nsegregated are Phelps Lane Elemental'<br />\nColumbus Elementary, William Fell Element ,.<br />\nHilton Elementary, and Lombard Junior<br />\nOn the high school level there are three all-\"5c<br />\nschools, Carver, Dunbar, and Douglass.<br />\n<br />\nVW.<br />\n<br />\nwerint 11.11<br />\n<br />\nOffice of the Chaplain<br />\npresents<br />\n<br />\nSUMMER JOBS<br />\n<br />\nDR.

The<br />\nsolution is not easy. Protests against Dow Chemical,<br />\nagainst<br />\nBarton Hall, against the poor quality of concerts<br />\nin recent<br />\nyears are only an indication of a larger and<br />\nmuch more vital frustration which is prevalent on this<br />\ncampus. The<br />\nStudent Council in the last few years has<br />\nbeen guilty of a lack of relevance to the real needs of<br />\nstudent life. The valiant attempt this spring to institute<br />\ncalendar reform is a sign that perhaps at last the Student<br />\nCouncil can do something of value for the students it<br />\nserves.<br />\nThe oppostition on the part of both the<br />\nadministration and the faculty to the proposal reveals<br />\n'he central cause of that frustration. We are told that we<br />\nare<br />\nsecond-class, that we can only admire from a<br />\ndistance the great minds on this campus. There is a<br />\nchronicfailure on the part of Dr. Gordon and of the<br />\nfaculty to realize that each student's commitment to this<br />\nuniversity is a great one. $15,000 and four years of life is<br />\nnothing to be scoffed at.<br />\nIf the University does not provide speakers, the<br />\nstudent Council must take. that initiative. The<br />\nsenhower<br />\niValue for Symposium must be made into a thing of<br />\nstudents. The Student Council must take the<br />\n<br />\nresponsibility for being the leaders and innovators of an<br />\nLevering Hall, a strong<br />\nincreased student life.<br />\nhope in the area of student activity, must be supported<br />\nand strengthened.<br />\nA professor I had freshman year said one day that<br />\ncollege should be an experiment in life styles. Many<br />\nthings could be said of Hopkins but that is not one of<br />\nthem. The Student Council must undertake the direction<br />\nand responsibility for such experiments. It must speak<br />\nloudly enough and long enough to be a real voice of its<br />\nstudents. And the students themselves must help. As a<br />\nmuch touted alumnus of Hopkins, John Barth, once<br />\nwrote,\"How can you stand not to be marvelous?\"<br />\n<br />\nJOHN GUESS<br />\nThe basic thrust of my campaign will be Student<br />\nCouncil-.Student Body Communication. The role of the<br />\nCouncil ideally is to reflect student opinion. Here at<br />\nJohns Hopkins, this hasnot been the case in practicality.<br />\nThe goal, as I see it, should be work toward making the<br />\nCouncil here truly responsive to student attitudes. To<br />\nthis end, I feel that the Student Council should take<br />\npublic stands on all University issues involving students.<br />\nFurthermore, more and more issues involving students<br />\nshould be put before referendum, in areas where the<br />\nUniversity intends to take action. The search, then, is for<br />\ngreater student voice through communication with the<br />\nStudent Council. There are no expectations of 100<br />\npercent response. The point which is most important<br />\nhere is that an effort will be made.<br />\nA candidate last year stated,\"A political platform<br />\nby definition must be direct, incisive, and specific.

At times, in the past, we have found it hard to<br />\ntake the Council seriously; at times, we have found major faults with the<br />\nCouncil's attitudes, policies and procedures.<br />\nThis year, however, the fight over calendar reform proved to us that<br />\nconcern for a strong, progressive Council is important. With the current<br />\nlack of adequate means of student representation in the policy-making of<br />\nthe University, it is important to have a Student Council and an SC<br />\npresident who can work productively to bring about reforms demanded<br />\nby undergraduates.<br />\nIn comparison to past Council leaders, Russell Passarella has done a<br />\ncommendable job as SC president. The choice of his successor is a matter<br />\nwhich should concern undergraduates.<br />\nWe find it unfortunate that only two candidates are running for the<br />\noffice of President. One candidate did not enter until it became clear that<br />\nonly one other student wanted the post. This seems to confirm our<br />\nCynical, but probably true, suspicion that the only undergraduates who<br />\nare even slightly concerned with problems of student affairs and student<br />\nrepresentation are those few who are elected to bother with such matters.<br />\nJudging by our knowledge of the two candidates, John Guess and<br />\nCook Goolrick, we could see fit to endorse either. Both express<br />\nProgressive attitudes towards the status and role of the undergraduate at<br />\nHopkins, and both, for once, are not examples of the hackneyed,<br />\nstereotyped student politician who usually abound in undergraduate<br />\nelections.<br />\nWe feel, however, that John Guess, a sophomore who has served on<br />\nthe Council, Black Student Union, and the Student Association, is the<br />\nmore qualified of the two. In the past few weeks, Guess has been working<br />\non ideas and policies to be instituted if elected, and has been scouring the<br />\ncampus to find qualified students to assist both the Council and himself,<br />\nas President. We have heard him specifically outline his attitudes towards<br />\nstudent government and issues at Hopkins, and we find ourselves in<br />\nagreement with many of his points.<br />\nWe urge all students to vote for John Guess next week; more<br />\nbasically, however, we urge all students to vote.<br />\n<br />\nYOU 50-r YOUR HIS-MY/<br />\n<br />\nWHIT HISTORY!<br />\n<br />\n\"Now that we've learned to talk, let's not speak in vague generalities.\"<br />\n<br />\nPay As You Go<br />\nThe decision of the university, announced by Dr. Gordon, to charge<br />\na $2 admission fee to the Hopkins - Navy lacrosse game is regrettable; yet,<br />\nat the same time, it is both justified and necessary.<br />\nDr. Gordon's statement made it clear that the receipts from the<br />\ngame are going to be used to defray the cost of constructing an additional<br />\n4,800 seats at Homewood Field. At times, attendance for important<br />\nHomewood games has neared '10,000 if the count includes potential fans<br />\nwho could not get in or who stayed away due to the lack of seating room.<br />\nThe additional seats will double the present capacity of Homewood Field,<br />\nand we feel that this is a service worth paying for.<br />\nOur only doubts concerning Dr. Gordon's announcement concern<br />\nthe possibility of charging admission to other games in certain Hopkins<br />\nsports. The admission fee policy sliould be used discriminately \u2014 in<br />\ninstances where it is not crucial to charge for admission, ticket sales<br />\nshould not be instituted.<br />\n<br />\nMoral Uplift<br />\nWe feel it our duty to remind those who haven't heard of the<br />\nupcoming Decency Rally, this Sunday, in Memorial Stadium. If we know<br />\nBaltimore, there will be a large crowd on hand fresh from a King Family<br />\nconcert and ready to answer Hyman Pressman's call-to-arms.<br />\nWe would hope that the organizers of the Decency. Rally will not let<br />\nan outstanding Hopkins individual go unnoticed. As our contribution to<br />\nwholesomeness, we would like to offer the name of Dennis Estis, former<br />\nNews-Letter editor and Adams housemaster. Mr. Estis struck a blow for<br />\nabove-the-board male-female relations last week, when he diligently<br />\nturned in a Hopkins freshman for having a girl in Baker House at 12:30<br />\na m. on a weekday night.

Do you see how this can be remedied?<br />\nDELLINGER : One of the Movement goals should<br />\nbe to create an egalitarian society of human community,<br />\nof human fraternity, which operates in economic and<br />\nother areas.<br />\nIt i false to think that a movement can create<br />\nsomething essentially different from itself, essentially<br />\ndifferent from the practices of human relationships that<br />\nit develops, that it experiences in its daily struggle.<br />\nTherefore, people in the Movement should not live lives<br />\nthat are dominated by the search for profit, the search<br />\nfor a higher material standard of living than other<br />\npeople.<br />\nIt's not that it is so scandalous to be middle class in<br />\none's origins and orientations, but people who become<br />\nacquainted with the vast extent of suffering and injustice<br />\nin the world will naturally seek out some kind of alliance<br />\nwith people who are not middle class. I hope that atleast after the initial impulse in that direction, it will not<br />\nbe based just on guilt or attachment to the victim, but<br />\nwill represent a real movement to learn from and also<br />\ncontribute to, to exchange ideas, experiences, attitudes,<br />\norganizing activities with these other people.<br />\nBlack Vanguard<br />\nThis has happened already between the black and<br />\nwhite movements in this country. It has been an erratic<br />\nprocess, and for all the good motivation of the early civil<br />\nrights activity, the relationships did tend to be<br />\ninegalitarian, they did tend to involve often unconscious<br />\ncondescension on the part of the white people, and a<br />\nwhole conditioned reflex of attitudes on the part of the<br />\nblack people toward the white. It was a very necessary<br />\nthing that the Black Power movement developed, and<br />\nthat the two elements had a type of separation in order<br />\nfor each to face itself and its own problems for a time.<br />\nBut despite the fact that we are still in this stage to<br />\nsome extent, it's obvious that as people with many<br />\nsimilar goals in a basically similar struggle, and with a<br />\ncommon enemy, there is a learning process going on,<br />\nparticulary the whites learning from the blacks. A lot of<br />\nthe education that we are getting comes from the black<br />\npeople, who are the vanguard of the American<br />\nmovement.<br />\nThis doesn't mean that they are not without their<br />\nmistakes, their flaws, but they certainly add very much<br />\nto and correct the white middle class experience.<br />\nNEWS-LETTER: Do you then support the SDS in their<br />\ndrive to form a coalition with workers' groups and labor<br />\nunions?<br />\nGreater<br />\ngeneral terms, yes.<br />\nDELLINGER: , In<br />\ninteraction between students and workers is very<br />\nimportant. But I think that it is important that the<br />\nstudents not repeat the mistake of the Civil Rights<br />\nmovement, of going to the workers with either a<br />\nphilantropic attitude on the one hand, or a kind of guilt<br />\ncomplex that leads them to be uncritical and unequal in<br />\ntheir relationships with the workers.<br />\nOut-Blacking Blacks<br />\nthe South in 1963, one of the things<br />\nin<br />\nwas<br />\nWhen I<br />\nthat impressed me was not just the superficial and<br />\ncondescending attitude of the whites at some points, the<br />\nunconscious assumption that they could somehow<br />\nunderstand the black person's problems and give<br />\npolitical leadership and assume important posts.<br />\nBut there was another tendency also, by which white<br />\ncollege students went into the South and tried to<br />\nout-black the blacks in a way which meant that they<br />\nwere so consumed by their attraction to the black<br />\npeople, this strange foreign world to them, that they<br />\nsurrendered their individuality and their identity as<br />\npeople. 1 think that their uncritical aping of the blacks,<br />\ntaking on black mannerisms and black customs, was<br />\ngood for neither the black people nor for them.<br />\nIn certain sections of SDS and Progressive Labor there<br />\nare times when I see a repetition of this attitude: the<br />\nworkers are automatically correct, the workers are<br />\nautomatically the vanguard. When the fact is that, while<br />\nthe workers in this country in a lot of areas have healthy<br />\npolitical instincts and responses, in other areas and in<br />\nother ways they have been corrupted by the society in<br />\nwhich they live and are not in any way active as the<br />\nvanguard. In many cases when they politicalize things,<br />\ntheir political objectives are unsound.<br />\nI find very often there is more rhetoric than reality in<br />\nthe talk in certain circles of becoming part of the<br />\nworking class or joining the working class. I think that it<br />\nis the right direction to move to, but it is going to be a<br />\nlong slow process which should not be romanticized.<br />\nNEWS-LETTER: Do you thinkrevolutionrhetoric, the<br />\nviolent talk of violent upheaval, accomplishes anything?<br />\nDELLINGER: Rhetoric, as such, is always harmful,<br />\n<br />\niff<br />\nWre<br />\n<br />\nAnti-war Movement leader David Dellinger (left), with his faithful Tonto--buttoned bedecked Jerry Rubin.<br />\n<br />\nwhether it's a good rhetoric or a bad rhetoric. Now we<br />\ncan never completely eliminate the gap between rhetoric<br />\nand action; if we could, it would mean that we weren't<br />\nreaching out for new ideas and new dreams.<br />\nBut the attempt should be always to translate the<br />\nrhetoric into actuality. I find that a lot of the current<br />\nrhetoric about violence is very harmful, leaving aside<br />\nquestions about the relative advantages of violence and<br />\nnon-violence.<br />\nCorrupting Effect<br />\nme that the preponderance of<br />\nto<br />\nis<br />\nIt<br />\nobvious<br />\n<br />\nviolence, of weapons and technology, is in the hands of<br />\nthe establishment. Although I do think to be honest<br />\nabout it, that guerrilla warfare in the cities could<br />\nactually turn out to be more successful in the short run<br />\nthat one would guess. The idea of the armed overthrow<br />\nof the U.S. government by students or black people or<br />\nothers is quite unrealistic.<br />\nI also think that the tendency to organize around an.d<br />\nresort to violent methods tends to keep the movement 10<br />\na relatively isolated situation, because people wh\u00b0<br />\n(Continued on Page 10)<br />\n<br />\nGo Gentle Into That Good Night<br />\nBy WILLIAM BENZON<br />\nLet us proceed then to that place<br />\nAnd hesitate no longer; I am driven<br />\nBy an insistent voice that comesfrom God.<br />\nChildren,follow me this way: see, now,<br />\n1 have become your guide, as you were mine!<br />\nCome: do not touch me: let me alone discover<br />\nThe holy and funereal ground where I<br />\nMust take thisfated earth to be my shroud.<br />\nThis way,0 come!

On the<br />\nother hand, we do our best to ignore the reality of<br />\ndeath.

Some of the more puerile members<br />\nof our medical and technological establishment have<br />\nbeen trying to inject a note of optimism into this rather<br />\nsordid and obscene situation.

And we will greedily<br />\ngrasp for every bit of it, for we are talking about the<br />\nMan who, as Dylan says, \"passionately hates his life and<br />\nlikewise fears his death.\" And we should note the causal<br />\n<br />\nconnection. It is not the fear of death which causes<br />\nhatred of life\u2014for how many of us have been dead an<br />\nhave lived to tell of it? Rather it is the hatred of life<br />\nwhich breeds fear of death.<br />\nIt is as though the more wretched our life has been<br />\nthe more we hope that the next moment will be the one<br />\nhappy moment which will redeem all the proion,57<br />\nmisery\u2014who is willing to give up his one happy moment\u2022<br />\nWe<br />\nAnd if we get our one happy moment, then maybe if<br />\nare patient, we will get another happy moment 20 Years<br />\nfrom now.<br />\nWaiting for the happy moment is called HTe.:<br />\nExpecting it to redeem all misery is Divine Grace. ID!'<br />\nHope and this Grace are truly wretched, for this Hope Is<br />\nmerely the failure to take the possibility of suicide<br />\nseriously and this Grace is the very least Divinity owes us<br />\nfor subjecting us to His misery.

B. King album is an<br />\nImportant event. As the trite but true cliche says,<br />\neveryone is going back to his roots. And those roots<br />\nare planted in either the Nashville<br />\ncountry and western<br />\ntradition or in Mississippi delta blues.<br />\nTypifying the latter style is B. B. King. Most people<br />\nknow the story of his hard life - twenty years of<br />\n\"e-nighters in back alley ghetto cellars or backwoods<br />\nPine .shacks, then the beginnings of long-delayed<br />\nice\u00b0<br />\nWhitgenition in the wake of such big-time big<br />\n-money<br />\nguitarists as Clapton and Bloomfield. And if we<br />\nare to believe the usual extravagant liner notes, this new<br />\nalbum (His Best-The<br />\nElectric B. B. King) will finally<br />\nelevate him to his deserved stardom.<br />\nHowever, this record just won't do it. It is not his<br />\nbest, and is hardly electric at all. My complaint is<br />\nnot<br />\nWith B. B. King; he is still the King of the Blues, still a<br />\nfantastic guitarist. But if he wants a reputation as such,<br />\nhe should<br />\nput out a blues album with beaucoup de guitar<br />\nWork.<br />\nThe first song, \"Tired of Your Jive,\" is probably the<br />\nWorst, partly because of its numerous inherent defects,<br />\nbut<br />\nbecause it is the first (and very disappointing)<br />\nalsote one receives of King after dashing<br />\nfrom the<br />\nookstore to a record player with this album. Brutal and<br />\nunmoral surgery has been performed<br />\non King's voice,<br />\nem<br />\nasculating it. He sounds smooth, easy, feminine, very<br />\ncommercial<br />\niconlmc<br />\n- like an endless procession of Tony Bennett<br />\nook- and'<br />\n-soundlik<br />\non the Ed Sullivan Show.<br />\nProducer Johnny Pate<br />\nor some clown in the studio has<br />\ntransmogrified the King of the Blue into<br />\nthe Buffoon<br />\nof the<br />\nBroadway Show Tunes.<br />\nThe foul injustice wreaked on King's vocal abilities<br />\nWould perhaps be tolerable if confined<br />\nto one song; it is<br />\nnot.<br />\nthe soundtrack of For Love of Ivy there are<br />\ntwo<br />\nbreonshorrendous<br />\n)rrendous songs that not even Archie Bell and the<br />\nwould do. \"Paying the Cost to be the Boss\"<br />\nsounded<br />\nbetter on television, a medium justly famous<br />\nfor<br />\nWeakening and/or destroying the performances of<br />\nelectric musicains. The second side is a welcome<br />\nlInProvement, but still not all it could be.<br />\nBeing an<br />\nadmitted guitar fanatic, I have not really<br />\nPaid<br />\nvoice much attention to King's powerful and passionnate<br />\nbefore. To paraphrase Jack Bruce, the words are<br />\n<br />\nB. B. King (left) and Lucille, with his back-up band, Sonny Freeman and the Unusuals.<br />\n<br />\nthere to begin and end the song. But now that a<br />\npapier-mache Perry Como has been nefariously<br />\nsubstituted for the Beale Street Blues Boy, I am aware<br />\nnot only of what I was missing before but of what is not<br />\nthere now on His Best.<br />\nThe only way to appreciate King's dynamic singing is<br />\nin concert, for there are no electronic castrators to come<br />\nbetween his vocal cords and the listener's ears. This<br />\npoint is painfully demonstrated by the inclusion of a live<br />\ncut, \"Sweet Sixteen,\" in which the raw growling<br />\nemotion of the real B. B. King is heard.<br />\nBut one can criticize \"Sweet Sixteen\" for the same<br />\nreason the whole album can be criticized: no guitar. In<br />\nthis era of intricate virtuosos, of 17-minute \"Spoonfuls,\"<br />\nwhy must King just tempt us with a modicum of the<br />\nhoneybitter notes in Lucille's vocabulary? There is more<br />\nguitar work on Live at the Regal, an album King<br />\nrecorded in 1964 (and still very exciting; like<br />\n<br />\nProjections, it is one of those few albums that have<br />\nsurvived the vicissitudes of musical fads.)<br />\nIn his present concert performances King devotes a<br />\ngood proportion of his efforts to Lucille, his guitar;<br />\nmud. more than on Live at the Regal. Perhaps he<br />\nrealizes what many in his new-found white audience<br />\ncome to him for. Unfortunately, his record company<br />\ndoes not. (Another example of this: I cannot imagine<br />\nAlbert King making Live Wire-Blues Power in a studio.)<br />\nIn \"Don't Answer the Door\" the haunting banshee<br />\nsounds of King's guitar are much in evidence, placed in<br />\nthe distant background for an odd but intriguing effect.<br />\nBut that's it, except for a few lamentably brief<br />\nintroductions and breaks. King wastes his talent by<br />\nplaying just a simple catchy riff in \"Think it Over\";<br />\nRobby Krieger could learn to do as well. The King's<br />\nregal powers (by Divine Right) seem to evaporate when<br />\nhe enters a studio.

The 1840 Whig candidate was General William<br />\nHarrison, the frontrunner among the regional<br />\ncandidzites of 1836. A well-read landowner, with a<br />\n,ondne<br />\nfl)res\u201e,_.ss for classical studies, General Harrison was<br />\n`oted in his famous campaign as a Jackson-type<br />\nsr\u00b0ntiersman, and he easily defeated Jackson's chosen<br />\nhii.cees<br />\nonfor. (Jackson had certainly been a landowner, but<br />\nJos<br />\ndness for classical studies has not been verified.)<br />\nHis Own Petard<br />\ntiddunted, Van Buren was the leading aspirant for<br />\nthen<br />\n1844.em0cratic Presidential nomination through most of<br />\nIle was stopped by a rule passed in his own<br />\nbett<br />\nveefit In 1832, in order to demonstrate Van Buren's<br />\nr,,,,n<br />\n'velming support for Vice President, the<br />\n111()cratie National Convention ruled that nominations<br />\nbvrPre!<br />\n0 a twiident and Vice President would have to be made<br />\nThe 0-thirds vote.<br />\neffect of this was to give the South a veto on any<br />\nand after Van Buren expressed his<br />\ne<br />\n, chravnelesition<br />\nto fast annexation of Texas he did not have a<br />\nthe b for nomination.

He got no<br />\n<br />\ne<br />\n<br />\nelectoral votes but managed to run second in his home<br />\nbase of New York, outpolling Cass.<br />\nThe minor party route back to the White House was<br />\nnavigated with equal lack of success by Millard Fillmore.<br />\nFillmore was elected Vice President in 1848 and served<br />\nabout half the term of President Zachary Taylor, who<br />\ndied in office. He wanted the Whig nomination to<br />\nsucceed himself in 1852, but didn't get it.<br />\nIn 1856, during the first race between Republicans<br />\nand Democrats, Fillmore was the nominee of the<br />\nhyper-nativist American Party and of the Whig remnants.<br />\nHe did better than Mr. Van Buren had, polling about a<br />\nfifth of the popular vote and the electoral vote of<br />\nMaryland.<br />\nThe next President to seek to return to office after a<br />\nfour-year hiatus was Ulysses S. Grant. Grant was<br />\nnarrowly elected in 1868, but he significantly improved<br />\nhis popular majority against the erratic Horace Greeley<br />\nin 1872.<br />\nIt was considered likely that he would seek a third<br />\nterm in 1876. However, the reformist Liberal<br />\nRepublicans, who had failed rather ignominiously after<br />\nobtaining Democratic acceptance of their Greeley<br />\ncandidacy, were gaining strength with increased<br />\nopposition to Grant's corrupt appointments and lack of<br />\nleadership. A House of Representatives resolution<br />\nconcerning the lack of wisdom in a President's serving<br />\nthree terms helped inhibit Grant's desire to seek<br />\nrenomination in 1876.<br />\n\"Best Obstacle\"<br />\nIn 1880, however, Senator Roscoe Conkling of New<br />\nYork fixed on Grant as the best obstacle to a<br />\nPresidential nomination for Conkling's chief Republican<br />\nrival, the charismatic James G. Blaine. Mr. Grant was in a<br />\nposition where the President's salary would be of<br />\nmaterial benefit to him, and he was willing to run.<br />\nConkling's excellent nominating speech indicated that as<br />\none chooses a physician on the basis of experience with<br />\nhim, so it would be foolhardy to deny the Presidency for<br />\nGrant merely because he had held the job before, since<br />\nhe had discharged the Presidency so well (sic).<br />\nGrant led on the early ballots, with Blaine a game and<br />\nrespectable second. On the thirty-sixth ballot the<br />\nnomination went to Senator-elect James A. Garfield of<br />\nOhio, a result more pleasing to Blaine than to Conkling.<br />\nGrover Cleveland was the only President to succeed in<br />\n<br />\nreturning to the White House, although on the basis of<br />\nthe popular vote there should have been no interruption<br />\nin his service. Elected in 1884 by a meager 23,000 votes.<br />\nover Blaine, President Cleveland built his popular<br />\nmajority up to over 100,000 in his 1888 race with<br />\nBenjamin Harrison. However, Harrison, grandson of the<br />\nHarrison who earlier defeated a Democratic incumbent<br />\nfor re-election, had more electoral votes and became<br />\nPresident.<br />\nSeeks Third Nomination<br />\nAfter four years in a prosperous law practice.<br />\nCleveland sought a third nomination in 1892. There was<br />\ncriticism of him as a \"perpetual candidate,\" but he<br />\nreceived nomination and, in another close race, defeated<br />\nPresident Harrison.<br />\nAs late as 1904, when there was a conservative<br />\nDemocratic reaction to two-time nominee William<br />\nJennings Bryan, Cleveland was considered a possibility<br />\nto run for President. Cleveland did not actively<br />\nencourage this movement, but he was enthusiastic over<br />\nthe Democrats' choice of New York State Chief Justice<br />\nAlton B. Parker. A thorough supporter of Cleveland.<br />\nParker was opposed by Bryan as late as 1912, when each<br />\nsought the post of Temporary Chairman of the<br />\nDemocratic National Convention. Despite Cleveland's<br />\nbacking, as exemplified in a magazine article, 'Justice<br />\nParker was buried in November.<br />\nTheodore Roosevelt, who achieved a record majority<br />\nagainst Justice Parker, immediately announced that he<br />\nwould not seek re-election. In 1908 Roosevelt firmly<br />\ndeclined renomination and saw his Secretary of War,<br />\nWilliam Howard Taft, defeat Bryan for the Presidency_<br />\nIn 1912, after President Taft had alienated Republican<br />\nprogressives, Roosevelt sought progressive support for<br />\nhis own nomination. He defeated President Taft in a<br />\nseries of primaries, but was denied the Republican<br />\nnomination.All angry Roosevelt became the nominee of<br />\nthe Progressive party, which was essentially a vehicle for<br />\nhis own ambitions, and ran second, outpolling Taft.<br />\nThere was slight support for Roosevelt in 1916.<br />\nSince then former Presidents have not actively sought<br />\nrenomination, although it has been suggested that<br />\nHerbert Hoover wanted renomination in 1940.

It is only from the humanity and superior<br />\nhuman relationships of the Movement that a new society<br />\ncan be built.

I say this with some hesitation,<br />\nbecause I think there is too much concern with the<br />\n<br />\nThe Movement Had<br />\nCome To a Period<br />\nOf Confusion'<br />\nbacklash. If one is doing the thing that needs to be done,<br />\nand has not lost his focus (working on a definite object),<br />\nthen I think that one has to chance the backlash or face<br />\nup to it.<br />\nI also think that the rhetoric of violence does harm in<br />\nthat it adds a kind of spurious romance to the<br />\nMovement, and that very often discourages people from<br />\ngoing through the very hard political analysis of goals,\u2022<br />\nstrategy, and tactics which is required. Instead of doing<br />\nthe study and the work, one gets caught up in the<br />\nexcitement of street lighting.<br />\nN-L: Would you speculate on the length to which the<br />\nNixon Administration and state governments may carry<br />\nrepression?<br />\nDELLINGER: The evil genius of the American system is<br />\nto be able to use a combination of repression and<br />\nco-optation. Wherever possible it would like to blur over<br />\nthe fact of repression, particularly on places like college<br />\ncampuses. But it is a little early in the Nixon<br />\nAdministration, plus there are other factors, such as<br />\nwhat happens on the battlefield in Vietnam and in Paris,<br />\nwhich will have an influence on the extent to which they<br />\nare willing and able, or able to get away with, overt<br />\nrepression.<br />\nI do believe that the war cannot be maintained at<br />\nits present level without some fairly extreme forms of<br />\n<br />\nrepression being introduced. This is one of the reasons<br />\nthat the Administration is going to try to resolve the<br />\nwar, not really handle it the way it should be, but<br />\nnonetheless patch-up some sort of face-saving peace, so<br />\nthat it will not get into the position of having to<br />\ninstitute a rather extensive repression.<br />\nN-L: What visible effects have the Paris peace talks had,<br />\nboth on the Movement and the American people as a<br />\nwhole?<br />\nDELLINGER: The immediate effect of them was to<br />\ncreate the illusion that the government had made a turn<br />\ntoward peace. And although it might be annoyingly<br />\nslow, ending the war was on the way. Given all the<br />\ncompetition, the time and energy and all the<br />\ninconveniences, like having your head beaten in by the<br />\npolice, there was a natural tendency for people to hold<br />\nback, not to support the war, but simply to refrain from<br />\ndemonstrations.<br />\nThis effect was compounded by the fact that the<br />\nMovement had come to a period of tactical confusion,<br />\nwhen it was obvious that new methods were needed. It<br />\nwas kind of difficult for people to figure out what these<br />\nnew methods were. So between the boredom that had<br />\ndeveloped with demonstrations, and the idea that the<br />\npeace talks were on the way, and although they might<br />\ndrag on they will lead to peace, there has been a<br />\ntendency for a lot of people to opt out or just hold<br />\nback.<br />\n<br />\nBut we have begun to enter a new period.

The<br />\nfact is that the United States found it militarily<br />\nadvantageous to stop the bombing of the North, where it<br />\nnever worked anyway, and to concentrate its total fury<br />\nin a smaller area in the South.

The seminar is studying projects based<br />\nOn on-the-job experience and education,<br />\nwhich will help to correct<br />\nthis situation.<br />\nTeaching careers, for example, could begin at the level of<br />\nTeacher's Aide. The college-age person would operate audio-visual<br />\nequipment, perform clerical tasks and do similar work. The<br />\n'experience gained from this work leads to higher level jobs as an<br />\nassistant. Preparing class materials and leading small discussions<br />\nwould give the worker under the \"New Careers Model\" the training<br />\nnecessary to become an Associate Teacher by the time he would<br />\nhave graduated from college.<br />\nTwo weeks from now there will be a field trip to New York<br />\nWhere the students in the seminar will observe the 'New Careers\"<br />\nProjects first hand and see if they are now succeeding.<br />\nJim Archibald, Jim Marra, Ron Remick, and Frenchie Smith<br />\nare the Hopkins students participating in this program.

The seminar meets altrnately in the Eisenhower and<br />\nthe Soper Libraries on Saturday mornings.<br />\n<br />\nerotica were put on the departments'<br />\nclosed shelves to protect them from<br />\nstealing. Walton stated that the sex<br />\nbooks, most of them published 30 or<br />\nmore years ago, were never sorted out<br />\nwhen they were moved to Eisenhower.<br />\nIn today's environment, though,<br />\nWalton believed \"there is no great need<br />\nto overprotect these anthropoligical<br />\nstudies. If and when time permits we<br />\nwill select material for release. Until we<br />\ndo, people can just note by the card<br />\ncatalog that these books are in the<br />\ncage:\"<br />\nMiss Emily Schilpp, the assistant<br />\nlibrarian, said Eisenhower has no set<br />\ncriteria other than expense to evaluate a<br />\nbook dealing with sex. Whether or not a<br />\nbook is placed in the cage is<br />\ndeterminated by the opinions of the<br />\nstaff filing the book,she explained. Mrs.<br />\nMiddleton, who gets the requested<br />\nbooks from the cage, repeated that<br />\n\"there is no formal group which decides<br />\nwhat books go in the closed shelves.\"<br />\n<br />\nWalton said that library books are<br />\nautomatically ordered on a faculty<br />\nmember's recommendation. \"We never<br />\nquestion the content of a book a<br />\nprofessor wants,\" Walton noted.<br />\nAuthorized staff members also may<br />\nsuggest books which, in Walton's words,<br />\n\"support the academic program\" of the<br />\nuniversity. He said, though, that' lie<br />\nknew of few instances where a student<br />\nasked for a book. In such a case, \"We<br />\nwould take it under advisement.\"<br />\nCurrent literature outside the<br />\nacademic program is offered in a special<br />\nX collection on the main floor. About<br />\n140 books are available and others are<br />\nbeing ordered.<br />\nRecently the library cancelled its<br />\nsubscription to \"Avant-Garde.\"<br />\nAccording to Walton, this was no<br />\nattempt at censorship. \"The magazine<br />\nwould be mutilated immediately after it<br />\nwas placed on the shelf,\" he contended.<br />\n\"I see not much sense in buying it<br />\nthen.\"<br />\n<br />\nStudents to Advise Frosh<br />\n<br />\nSpecially selected upperclassmen<br />\nwill replace the faculty advisors for next<br />\nyear's freshmen class, Paul Allen, the<br />\nChairman of the Orientation Committee,<br />\nannounced this week.<br />\nThe junior or senior student advisor will be<br />\nresponsible for counseling a group composed of<br />\nabout thirty freshmen.

Chairman Allen stated, \"Only<br />\nthose showing extreme interest and enthusiasm<br />\nin this new approach to freshmen orientation will<br />\nbe considered.\"<br />\nThe initial program will formally last to the<br />\nend of the first semester next year. Allen said,<br />\nthough, that the counselors should still associate<br />\nwith their advisees after the first half of the year<br />\n<br />\nto \"avoid the common complaint that the<br />\nprogram is imposed upon .the freshmen.\" It' the<br />\nstudent adviser program proves sucessful.

Don't these<br />\nyoung men know that Johns Hopkins is<br />\na university and not a brothel? After the<br />\nrecent tragedy on campus involving a<br />\ngirl, I think we need more rules and<br />\nregulations, not less.<br />\nHasn't anyone told these boys\u2014I<br />\navoid the word gentlemen\u2014that freedom<br />\nrests on responsibility'? From the<br />\nappearance of some of these freshmen,<br />\nthey aren't even mature enough to be<br />\naway from home. They should have<br />\nbrought their mamas along to tell them<br />\nto brush their hair, wash their face \u201e<br />\n(sic), shine their shoes, tuck in their<br />\nshirts, and shave! If their behavior<br />\nmatches their appearance, it wouldn't<br />\nbe safe to allow a girl on campus, much<br />\nless in their bedrooms.<br />\nIf the Administration doesn't<br />\nmake these boys \"Shape Up\", perhaps<br />\nthe student government need to take<br />\nsome responsibility in this area. A<br />\nwell-devised code of ethics and dress<br />\ndrawn up by student government could<br />\ndo much to improve the situation. At<br />\nleast it would make the freshmen aware<br />\nof the fact that what they do affects us<br />\nall.

McElroy and Mills were told<br />\nto PICK two graduate student<br />\n\"representatives\" to serve (or is it<br />\nsalivate?). Knowing full well that a<br />\ngraduate student government may be<br />\nformed within a month, they chose this<br />\nresponse to our action for what I can<br />\nonly surmise was a fear of a dangerous<br />\nprecendent being set before any<br />\ngraduate government forms: namely,<br />\nthe right of students to refuse to play<br />\nthe game by their rules. This might<br />\nprove to be too great a political lever,<br />\nmuch as the right to strike would be.<br />\nThe committee has met once, but<br />\nsince it doesn't know why it was<br />\nestablished, it is looking for something<br />\nto do.

Both the planned<br />\nincorporation of Levering Hall into the<br />\nOffice of Student Affairs and the<br />\nreluctance to grant tenure to the<br />\nUniversity Chaplain seem to us to derive<br />\nfrom a number of assumptions we<br />\nwould like to question. We hope that<br />\nour appeal to make the Chaplain's office<br />\nand Levering Hall directly responsible to<br />\nthe President and to grant tenure to the<br />\nUniversity Chaplain will receive your<br />\nserious attention, especially since we<br />\nbelieve that it is based on considerable<br />\ngraduate student support.<br />\nThe planned subordination of<br />\nLevering Hall activities under the office<br />\nof Student Affairs shows a<br />\nmisapprehension of the breadth and<br />\nscope of these activities. The programs<br />\nat Levering Hall have afforded us a view<br />\nof and access to some of the grave<br />\nproblems facing contemporary America<br />\nand provided the only meaningful<br />\nparticipation in Baltimore community<br />\nlife. In this endeavor we have been aided<br />\nand supported (but never actively<br />\n\"led\") by Dr. Wickwire.<br />\nLevering Hall, then, is more than a<br />\nself-contained club where Hopkins<br />\ngraduate and undergraduate students are<br />\ninvolved in dabbling in charity.

The successful continuance<br />\nof this undertaking is greatly dependent<br />\non the continued independence of<br />\nLevering Hall.<br />\nThis independence must further<br />\nbe insured by a realistic assessment of<br />\nthe role of the Chaplain within the<br />\nUniversity. The Chaplain's duties are<br />\nnot of an administrative nature alone,<br />\nnor are they limited to the performance<br />\nof perfunctory prayers at University<br />\nfunctions and the provision of ersatz<br />\npsychiatry. The Chaplain's freedom of<br />\nconscience and the ability to express the<br />\ndictates of that conscience must be<br />\nprotected as strongly as the professors<br />\nright to pursue truth and speak his<br />\nmind. Both must and will at times take<br />\nstands which are contrary to prevalent<br />\nopinion and need immunity from public<br />\npressure.

The following discourse between the<br />\nNews-Letter and Baltimore Mayor Thomas D'A lesandro,<br />\nIII was conducted this week. Ellipses denote the end of<br />\neach excerptfrom the interview.<br />\nNews-Letter: At this point in your administration,<br />\nhow would you assess your ability to relate to the<br />\nvarious elements of the black community, to recognize<br />\nthe relevant spokesmen of that community, and deal<br />\nWith its problems?<br />\nD'Alesandro: I feel very confident in dealing with<br />\nalmost every segment of the black community. At the<br />\ngovernmental level, with the elected officials from the<br />\nblack community, the Councilmen, and those whom I've<br />\nappointed to various boards and commissions.<br />\nDown in the neighborhoods, I've gotten close to the<br />\nPeople through my Job Bank, and my outreach<br />\nprograms to solicit the hard-core unemployed for gainful<br />\nemployment. There's where I've gotten the best rapport.<br />\nI cut through all of the recognized layers of<br />\nleadership...and I get right down to the people eyeball to<br />\neyeball, so to speak.<br />\nIn last summer's program, we've been able to process<br />\nClose to 8600 young men and women into jobs. In my<br />\ntours, I try to meet and talk with as many of them as I<br />\ncan. I try as best I can to make as many speaking<br />\nengagements to the little churches and the little<br />\nneighborhood councils or improvement associations, so<br />\nthat the people can get to see me,and at the same time,<br />\nSO I can see them.<br />\nOn those particular occassions, I try to allow some<br />\ntime so that I can at least spend an hour milling around<br />\nthe neighborhood and milling around with the people.<br />\nI try to relate at the grass roots level. As a result of<br />\nthis experience, I find that there is a tremendous amount<br />\nof black people who really have no one speaking for<br />\nthem. In some instances, they are living under very<br />\ntough conditions, economically. I go down there and try<br />\nto tie it up\u2014their wishes with an opportunity<br />\n.<br />\nsee coming some fine, strong, responsible Negro<br />\nleadership. I think the young man that I appointed to<br />\nthe School Board\u2014Larry Gibson\u2014is a real comer and is<br />\ngaining attention in the neighborhoods.<br />\nI think that the Ministerial Alliance has become more<br />\nactive. The representatives in the Urban Coalition are<br />\nsolid men. I find more activity now in the black<br />\ncommunity, as far as church and civic events are<br />\nconcerned...<br />\nI find that the only thing I can do is keep an open<br />\ndoor, and open mind, and have all segments of the<br />\ncommunity know that I'm willing to sit down, listen,<br />\nand talk with them. I hope, that as a result of this<br />\nattitude, the people feel that they have someone who is<br />\nConcerned about them here at City Hall.<br />\n.N-L: What do you think of the City Council's<br />\nrejection of a $64,000 0E0 grant destined for the<br />\nHopkins Student Association Tutorial Project?<br />\ntf Alesdandro: I'm in the process of trying, through<br />\namendments, to get that reconsidered. I was down in<br />\nAnnapolis on my special election bill the night that the<br />\nt!ling was delayed by the City Council. Since my return,<br />\nlye been talking to some of the Councilmen to find out<br />\nWhat their opposition was predicated on.<br />\n<br />\nSTUDENTS<br />\nGOOD HUMOUR needs part time<br />\nsalesman now \u2014 and full time<br />\nsalesmen through the Summer.<br />\nIf you can serve a GOOD<br />\nHUMOUR territory from NOW<br />\nTHROUGH MAY on<br />\nSATURDAYS AND SUNDAYS,<br />\nYou will average $25.00 per day in<br />\nCommissions - with a guaranteed<br />\nminimum in case of bad weather.<br />\n<br />\nI'm now in the process of seeing that, with the<br />\nappropriate amendments, this grant be reinstated in the<br />\nprogram. On the merits the program is a solid one. Who<br />\ncould argue with tutoring 600 inner city kids who need<br />\ntutoring? That speaks for itself. If the Councilmen have<br />\nany questions on collateral matters surrounding that,<br />\nwe'd have to take them into consideration. I'm working<br />\nnow on getting that reconsidered by the City Council<br />\nand I hope to do so quickly.<br />\nN-L: The same Tutorial Project and the rest of the<br />\nStudent Association is presently in jeopardy because of a<br />\npotential lack of University funding and the possibility<br />\nof a restructuring of authority for Levering Hall. In an<br />\naddress to the Hopkins community last September, you<br />\nlambasted the University for not becoming sufficiently<br />\ninvolved in the community. What do you see as the role<br />\nof an urban university?<br />\nD'Alesandro: Because we are the center of some fine<br />\neducational institutions, like Johns Hopkins and the rest,<br />\nI would like to see them allocate to me, as Mayor (or to<br />\nthe Governor, or the General Assembly, or the Council)<br />\nsome of their best brainpower\u2014not only faculty, but<br />\nstudents as well, on the order of the White House<br />\nFellowships...<br />\nThe fact that we hold public office doesn't give us any<br />\ncornerstone on knowledge. You can help us. You can<br />\nbegin to digest some of these probled we can get<br />\nthe benefits.<br />\n;Until I needle some of the colleges, the only time I<br />\nhave any contact with them is on graduation, or<br />\ninauguration, or if they call me out to make a speech to<br />\na class or assembly.<br />\nI'd like to have a real solid cadre of students who<br />\nwould be willing to learn some of the operations and the<br />\nproblems of government.

This organization, although limited<br />\nand very selective in membership (I speak from personal.<br />\nexperience. I was rejected by the Board twice) is perhaps<br />\nthe most active and constructive student group on campus.<br />\nCharged with the responsibility of running the school's<br />\nintramural program, the BIA is constantly searching for new and<br />\nimproved ways to better competition. This year's Board under Gene<br />\nDetroyer's responsible guidance and Col. Serena's ex'cellent<br />\nsupervision has reached new peaks of success.<br />\nSuch innovations as the divisional system in major sports<br />\nmeans increased participation, less forfeits, and more evenly<br />\nscheduled games all during regular season play. The one drawback to<br />\nthis is lopsided play-off arrangement. Yet,inevitably, the best teams<br />\nhave made it to the Finals. There isn't a more equitable league or<br />\ndivisional system than the one presently used. Division placement<br />\nhas been based on a team's past performance in that particular sport.<br />\nBIA Increases Participation.<br />\nOther commendable innovations have been the increased<br />\nparticipation in both squash and handball (each house was allowed<br />\nto enter three in each sport instead of one) the expansion of<br />\nvolleyball from more than a one night affair, and the addition of a<br />\nbilliards tournament. Thus a wider spectrum of interested students<br />\ncan find feasible outlets for their competitive spirit.<br />\nPersonally, I would like to see a soccer league or tournament<br />\nas well as a water polo tournament added to the schedule next fall.<br />\nAlso at some time in the future when the gym facilities are complete<br />\nand the necessary precautions can be taken a BIA Boxing<br />\nTournament might be added. Presently, there are a number of<br />\nHopkins students who do spar on their own, and this would give<br />\nthem something to shoot and train for.<br />\nDespite the success of this year's BIA Program, a number of<br />\nrough spots have yet to be smoothed over. Due to the insistance of<br />\nBIA-member Dave Hooper, several organizational meetings were held<br />\nto hash out these problems. The most salient of these were a needed ,<br />\nrevision of rules and scoring procedures, the dissemenatination of<br />\ninformation to teams, and the training of good refs. In trying to<br />\nmeet these and other problems, the BIA sees the need for set rules<br />\nbut also the need for flexibility.<br />\nProblems Always Will Exist<br />\nThese problems in some degree or other will always exist, but<br />\nthey can be lessened. Meanwhile, the Board sees other possible<br />\nproblems in the future which they must also meet. One example that I<br />\ncomes to mind is the situation that the new calendar will create.<br />\nHopefully, the deplorable situation of lack of both playing<br />\nfields and money to run the program effectively will be eliminated<br />\nby favorable administration action before the beginning of classes ;<br />\nnext September. Fields are already being laid out down in Wyman<br />\nPark, and a substantial increase in the BIA's budget will ease matters.<br />\nThese moves cannot help but to improve the general success of the<br />\nprogram.<br />\nThe BIA plans to hold freshman interviews in the upcoming<br />\nweeks. We encourage all interested freshman to apply. Admittedly<br />\nnot everyone that applies will be accepted, but it is definitely worth<br />\ntrying for. There is nothing worse than a defeatist attitude; such as<br />\nnot applying because one believes or has been told that the BIA is<br />\ncontrolled by one or several fraternities. These accusations might<br />\nhave had truth in the past, but they just aren't true today.<br />\n<br />\nIn what coach Bob Scott called \"by<br />\nfar our best game of the season\", the<br />\nHopkins lacrosse team overcame its most<br />\nformidable opponent to date by crushing<br />\nVirginia 15-4, before an SRO crowd of<br />\n6,500 Saturday at Homewood.<br />\nThe match up had been advertised as<br />\nthe first major clash of unbeaten lacrosse<br />\nteams this season, but the Blue Jays<br />\nquickly established their superiority by<br />\nramming in five goals before the Cavaliers<br />\ncould tally. In running their two-season<br />\nwin streak to 15, the stickmen played<br />\nnearly flawless ball control to dominate<br />\nthe first quarter and set the tone for the<br />\ngame.<br />\nAll-American attackman Joe Cowan<br />\nstarted the scoring barrage at 3:48 of the<br />\ninitial period when he kicked in a<br />\nrebound. Cowan assisted midfielders<br />\nCharlie Coker and Charles Goodell, and<br />\nattackmen Jim Feely and Stu Kahl scored<br />\nunassisted to amass a 5-0 lead before<br />\nVirginia Freshman Bob Proutt scored at<br />\n13:33 of the first period. Coker took a<br />\npass from Feely to open the<br />\nsecond-quarter scoring, and another<br />\nVirginia freshman, Jay Connor, countered<br />\nwith a rebound goal at 1:29 of the same<br />\nperiod.<br />\nSterling Defense<br />\nHowever, for the remainder of the second<br />\nquarter, all of the third, and the first 11 minutes<br />\nof the fourth - a total of 39% minutes - Hopkins'<br />\nsterling defense completely smothered the<br />\nCavalier offense. Meanwhile, the Jays deluged<br />\nVirginia with nine markers to turn the game into<br />\na rout.<br />\nVirginia's close defense, called in the<br />\nscouting report \"the best...ever seen\", was<br />\nparticularly ineffective in the crucial opening<br />\nperiod as the Hopkins stickhandlers thoroughly<br />\ndominated possession of the ball. The Cavaliers,<br />\nonly major lacrosse team to play freshmen on<br />\ntheir varsity (the adoption of this policy<br />\nprompted Army to drop Virginia from its<br />\nschedule in protest), was impotent against an<br />\noverpowering defense led by All-Americans Mike<br />\nClark, who shut off Connor with repeated checks<br />\n<br />\nand steals, and John Cardillo, a massive Long<br />\nIslander. Senior goaltender John Kelly, who<br />\nrepulsed 10 Virginia shots, was removed in the<br />\njob<br />\nlast quarter to a well-deserved ovation. Hisclose<br />\nwas made considerably easier by the<br />\ndefense, which not only limited Virginia to 28<br />\nshots, but executed some beautiful clears as well.<br />\nCharlie Coker, a junior middie, played his fines!,<br />\ngame of the year with four goals and a pair 01<br />\nassists; Cowan, the nonpareil attackman,<br />\nwhipped the Cavaliers' All-American defensernan<br />\nPete Coy time and time again, often enoughantO,<br />\npop in two goals and set up three others;<br />\nclassy<br />\nmidfielder Russ Moore displayed some<br />\nstickwork as he led both teams in ground balls.<br />\n<br />\nri<br />\nSI<br />\nuj<br />\nle<br />\nth.<br />\nPe<br />\n19<br />\nJur<br />\nJur<br />\nCO<br />\nsee<br />\nSc<br />\nthr,<br />\nthe<br />\nrest<br />\n<br />\nPotent Offense<br />\n<br />\n?41c1<br />\nThe potent Blue Jay offense pepper the<br />\nVirginia goalie Jim Eustace and his replacement 100<br />\nAl Hirsch with a staggering total of 68 shots,<br />\nincluding a double-pipe hit which wasn't credited<br />\nas a goal.

Presently only faculty members can<br />\nvote on the disciplinary committees which<br />\nrecommended the expulsions and suspensions to Dean<br />\nO'Connell.<br />\nParticipants in the disorders were photographed in some<br />\ncases. In others, they were recognizedby faculty<br />\nmembers or members of the Dean's staff. The students<br />\nwere then issued summonses for hearings. Although the<br />\npolice were not called in during the Chicago disruptions,<br />\nthe university expelled more students than Columbia,<br />\nBerkeley and San Francisco State combined.<br />\n<br />\nColumbia Occupied<br />\nA group of 20 black students occupied a Columbia<br />\nUniversity office on Monday to back their demands for a<br />\ngreater voice in the recruitment and admission of<br />\nNegroes to the institution.<br />\nThe black students accused the university of<br />\nhaving been \"systematically racist and oppressive in its<br />\nrelations with black people.\" They demanded that black<br />\nstudents be given the power to nominate an admission<br />\nboard and an admission staff that would recruit, admit<br />\nand help finance Negro students.<br />\nThe university rejected the demands, asserting that<br />\nColumbia already has a consulting board on black and<br />\nPuerto Rican admissions and will admit about twice the<br />\nnumber of black freshmen this year as last.<br />\nThe protest caught the faculty, administration and<br />\nthe S.D.S. by surprise. The faculty and administration<br />\nhad been under the impression that important progress<br />\nwas being made in a series of talks with the black<br />\nstudents about admissions policies and the creation of an<br />\nAfro-American studies program at Columbia.<br />\nDr. Andrew Cordier, the acting president, had<br />\nbeen regularly meeting with black students for weeks in<br />\nan attempt to work out what he has described as \"the<br />\nstrongest, soundest, academically best based Afro-American studies program in the country.\"<br />\n<br />\nDissent Confirmed<br />\nThe trustees of Catholic University of America<br />\n\"officially received\" a report that emphatically<br />\nvindicates the action of theologians on the university's<br />\nfaculty who publically dissented last summer from Pope<br />\nPaul's birth-control encyclical.<br />\nup by a board of inquiry after<br />\nThis report, di<br />\nseVen months of investigation, defends<br />\nuncompromisingly the full academic freedom of the<br />\nCa tholic theologians.<br />\nIt draws a sharp line between the functions of<br />\nbishops and theologians, and asserts that professors in<br />\ncontroversy should be judged by other professors in<br />\ntheir field and not by bishops. In fact, the report noted,<br />\ninterference by bishops in the academic sphere has a<br />\n\"devastating effect.\"<br />\nMost religions observers agree that never before<br />\nhas such an influential Catholic academic body in this<br />\ncountry backed so firmly a strong defense of freedom of<br />\ninquiry and speech by theologians.<br />\nThe report states. \"The right of a theological<br />\nscholar to dissent from non-infallible teachings of the<br />\nmagisterium (teaching authority) is well documented.\"<br />\nIt fur t her says that \"the dissemination of the<br />\ntheologian's views through the public media was<br />\nu4voidable.\"<br />\n<br />\nB.U.

There was only one incident.<br />\nThe secretarial staffs of the two ejected officials<br />\ncomplained that fiey had been \"terrorized\" by the<br />\nstudents when asked to leave. The demonstrators denied<br />\nthe accusation.<br />\nAfter the building's takeover, the University<br />\nCouncil and the faculty Senate Council, at a joint<br />\nmeeting, unanimously voted support of a university<br />\nposition paper, released last month, which condemned<br />\ndemonstrations that interfered with educational<br />\nprocesses.<br />\nMembers of Young Americans for Freedom held a<br />\nrally later in the day condemning the anti-ROTC radicals<br />\nand urging the administration not to give in to their<br />\ndemands.<br />\n<br />\nMarine Corps Blues<br />\nGeneral Leonard F. Chapman, Jr., said that<br />\nanti-war opposition, sometimes in the form of physical<br />\nobstruction, is cutting into Marine Corps office<br />\nrecruiting campuses across the country.<br />\nThe corps commandant said some college<br />\nadministrators not only are failing to control student<br />\nprotestors, but also are refusing to provide Marine<br />\nrecruiters adequate time and central locations to sign<br />\nmen on campus.<br />\n\"These colleges have failed to control student<br />\naction and normal recruiting activity has been<br />\nthwarted,\" the officer wrote to written questions by the<br />\nAssociated Press. The Marines get 85% of their officer<br />\ncandidates each year from the annual crop of graduating<br />\ncollege seniors.<br />\n<br />\nDeferments Upheld<br />\nFederal Judge Edward Weinfeld, declaring that<br />\nthere are inequities under the Selective Service Act, has<br />\nheld that the exemption of ministers and theological<br />\nstudents and the deferment of college students are not<br />\nunconstitutional.<br />\nJudge Weinfeld said the power of Congress to<br />\ngrant exemptions and deferments was broad and its<br />\nauthority to classify and to conscript manpower for<br />\nmilitary service was beyond question. 'In exercising that<br />\nauthority,\" the Federal judge, \"Congress may, in the<br />\nnational interest, provide complete exemption from<br />\nservice for some and partial exemption for others. This<br />\ndetermination, insofar as it centers about the national<br />\nwelfare, is a matter of legislative grace.\"<br />\nIn attacking the system of draft deferments for<br />\ncollege students, two of the defendants, James H.<br />\nBranigan, Jr. and Sammie Lee Brown, contended that<br />\nthe present system _discriminates against the lower<br />\nincome groups because those generally belonging .to<br />\nthem could not afford to pay tuition and other<br />\nnecessary college expenses. As a result of their economic<br />\ndeprivations, most were ill equipped to meet the college<br />\nacademic standards.<br />\nJudge Weinfeld answered that \"There need be no<br />\nblinking at the fact that student deferments have<br />\nresulted in disparities.\"<br />\n\"however, to recognize that some inequalities<br />\nexist does not stamp it as unconstitutional...\"<br />\n<br />\nsot<br />\n!<br />\n---,pi 'Pic by<br />\n<br />\n110<br />\ngametime\u2022<br />\nCROWDS GATHER near Lacrosse field before<br />\n<br />\nassesse<br />\nA two dollar admission fee will be<br />\nat the Homecoming lacrosse game against Nav,<br />\nin order to defray from the cost of an additiorold<br />\n4800 seats being purchased for Homew\u00b0\u00b0<br />\nField.<br />\nEach full time undergraduate and graduate sturler\u201e<br />\n<br />\nwill be,entitled to one free ticket for the homeconlivn;<br />\ngame.

Those<br />\ninterested call Whitney LeBlanc at<br />\n664-1698.<br /><br />\nHowever, eleven Crimson staffers<br />\ndissented and a minority view editorial,<br />\nthough condemning the police action,<br />\ncalled for more moderate alternatives.<br />\nMost of the student action<br />\nrevolves around radicals and moderates<br />\n(like the Memorial Church Group) who<br />\nhave been involved in the mass meetings<br />\nsuch as the Soldier's Field assembly on<br />\nMonday. The only vocal student group<br />\nwhich has publicly opposed the strike<br />\nsurfaced at a sparsely attended SaturdaY<br />\nmeeting drawing less than 100 student<br />\nconservatives.<br />\nHowever, there are other actions<br />\nalso running concurrently with the<br />\nstrike. 75 teaching fellows have<br />\nsupported the strike as well as seven<br />\nSDS demands. An additional group of<br />\n30 moderate teaching fellows approved<br />\nplans calling for the restructuring of the<br />\nuniversity.<br />\nGraduates Involved<br />\nThe graduate schools are also<br />\ninvolved. The Faculty of Law<br />\ncondemned SDS actions. The Graduate<br />\nSchool Students Association is<br />\npresenting its own set of demands<br />\nconcerning policy towards graduate<br />\nstudents and the issues of amnesty and<br />\nuniversity expansion.<br />\nThe Design School graduate<br />\nstudents presented to the university<br />\nfour demands on housing policy which<br />\nalso concerned expansion. A large<br />\nportion of the Medical School's first<br />\nyear students \"deplored\" the<br />\nUniversity's \"hasty action\" in calling<br />\npolice.<br />\nThe basic split in the strike<br />\nmovement lies between the moderates,<br />\nlike the Memorial Church Group and<br />\nsome of the graduate school committees<br />\nwho want some degree of reform, and<br />\nthe radical elements aligned with SDS<br />\nand Afro.<br />\nThe moderate groups have<br />\nfocussed on the principle of<br />\n\"restructuring\" while SDS considers this<br />\nidea \"diversionary\" and inspired \"by<br />\nthe Wall Street Journal.\" Though the<br />\nissue is more complex, the moderates<br />\nare aiming for more avenues to allow<br />\nmore participation in Harvard's<br />\ndecision-making, while SDS seeks a<br />\ncomplete overhaul of the balance of<br />\npower in the university.<br />\nColumbia Comparison<br />\nObvious comparisons can be<br />\ndrawn with last year's Columbia<br />\nrebellion. Questions of race (by dint of<br />\nblack studies) and militarism (ROTC,<br />\nrecruiting, CIA ties) were pointed out<br />\nby the Cox Commission in its analysis<br />\nof the Columbia disturbance, and the<br />\nsame motivating issues are implicit here.<br />\nHowever, to student moderates,<br />\nthe question of decision making is more<br />\nin line with traditional student power<br />\nissues \u2014 a focus which radical groups<br />\nlike SDS and Afro claim are secondary<br />\nto more far-reaching issues.<br />\nThe pattern of police raids and<br />\nstudent calls for amnesty have been<br />\nrepeated. The acquiesence of the<br />\nCorporation to the need for<br />\n\"restructuring\" also closely follows the<br />\nevents which occured in the aftermath<br />\nof the Columbia revolt.<br /><br />\nPAGE 3<br /><br />\nNEWS-LETTER<br /><br />\nHOMEWOOD, BALTIMORE, APRIL 18, 1969<br /><br />\n,.<br /><br />\nlioptans Doctor Notes Progress Against Cancer<br />\nBy STUART SEIDEL<br />\nDr. Hugh J. Davis, associate professor of<br />\ngynecology and obstetrics at the Johns Hopkins<br /><br />\nHospital and one of the developers of an<br />\ninter-uterine device in current birth-control use,<br />\ndiscussed his recent work towards the<br />\nelimination of cervical cancer.<br />\nDr. Davis, said that the incidence of cervical cancer<br />\namong women today can be controlled and that this can<br />\nbe accomplished relatively easily. The disease can be<br />\ndetected while in the developmental stages before it does<br />\nanY permanent damage. A woman can find out if she<br />\nhas the disease by having a \"pap smear test,\" designed to<br />\ndetect cervical cancer.<br />\n,<br />\nIf the disease is detected in early stages, before it<br />\nbecomes cancerous, it can be cured with minor surgery.<br />\nin an advanced stage at the time of detection,<br />\nnowever, the process for recovery is more complicated<br />\nand slightly less reliable. \"The advanced, fullblown<br />\ncancer is generally treated by radiation,\" said Dr. Davis.<br />\nDepending upon the stage of the cancer, it can still be<br />\ncLontained in about 85% of cases. \"If it has spread<br />\n\u00b0,eYond the cervix then the cure rate will drop down to<br />\n4% or less,\" depending upon the degree of<br />\nadvancement, he<br />\nexplained.<br />\nThe surgery involved in curing the early stages of<br />\nthe disease is very simple and local in nature. When<br />\ncaught in the developmental stages it is curable with<br />\ncomplete dependability in all cases. Cervical cancer is the<br />\ncolY common malignancy that is 100% curable when<br />\ntreated in a premature stage.<br />\nDr. Davis described the cancer as a \"mutant cell<br />\ncolony- that has some biological advantage over the<br />\nnormal cells, growing and replicating and gradually<br />\ntaking over more and more tissue until they compromise<br />\nvital functions.\"<br />\nWhen asked about research in connection with<br /><br />\nvaccinations to prevent cervical cancer, Dr. Davis said<br />\nthat there is some evidence that something might be<br />\ndeveloped but that it is still very much in the<br />\nformulating stages.<br />\nThe cervical cancer research has been conducted<br />\nwithout the aid of the federal government. All the<br />\nmoney came from private sources and the Maryland<br />\nDivision of the American Cancer Society.<br />\nContraceptive Research<br />\nDr. Davis has also done extensive research on<br />\ninter-uterine devices. He, along with assistants from the<br />\nHopkins Hospital, has developed a device for women<br />\nwho have not yet been pregnant. This work began about<br />\nfive years ago with a gift of money from a local source<br />\nwho was particularly concerned about contraceptive<br />\nmeans. The program has been continued with funds<br />\nfrom the Population Council in New York City, other<br />\nprivate gifts, and finances from the University.<br />\nHis work has also extended beyond the realms of<br />\nresearch; he has supported family planning and has<br />\ninduced the hospital to put a family planning nurse on<br />\nthe staff. The nurse's function is to give aid and<br />\ninformation about planning to patients.<br />\n\"I have never applied for or received one cent of<br />\nfederal money since I was discharged from the army,\"<br />\nDr. Davis said. He explained that Federal grants are<br />\ndifficult to get unless there is a specific project with<br />\nwhich an individual is concerned that is alos of interest<br />\nto the government.<br />\nNo Federal Money<br />\nDr. Davis said, \"There hasn't been any federal<br />\nmoney available for practical work in contraception.\"<br />\nHe did say, however, that Planned Parenthood has<br />\nreceived money from the Office of Economic<br />\nOpportunity.<br />\nReferring to the dispersal of government monies,<br /><br />\nDr. Davis said that at the \"highest level they talk about<br />\nlack of services, but when it comes to getting money to<br />\ntrain nurse-midwives to provide services, you have a hard<br />\ntime getting the financial backing to do this.\" He said<br />\nthat federal money still provides many services to the<br />\nmedical community, but that the help is too specifically<br />\ndirected.<br />\nDr. Davis said that \"a great deal of what is done is<br />\nstill done with a relatively small portion of private<br />\nmoney that is flexible.\"<br /><br />\nDR. HUGH DAVIS, J.H.H. associate professor of ob-gyn<br />\nsaid cervical cancer can be controlled.<br /><br />\nArab Hits Israeli Actions Israeli Scores 'Big Four'<br />\nIsrael's stand in the Middle<br />\nwas sharply<br />\ncriticized in an often-interrupted<br />\nsPeech delivered Tuesday by Mr.<br />\nani Masri, Attache of the<br />\nJ ordanian Mission to the United<br />\nE astern crisis<br /><br />\nNations.<br />\nIn attempting to present an Arab<br />\nview of the problem Mr. Masri was<br />\nforced to halt a number of times by<br />\nMembers of the audience voicing<br />\napparent doubts as to his veracity. The<br />\nq uestion-and-answer period which<br />\n110wed the speech was plagued with<br />\n.tne same problem as two or three<br />\nIn dividuals in the audience of<br />\naPProximately one hundred people<br />\nattempted to deliver separate<br />\n111\u00b0Itologues of their own, rather than<br />\nas<br />\nquestions.<br />\n\u201es In his speech Mr. Masri described<br />\nLe present crisis as resulting from the<br />\nInterplay of \"local forces,\" and said that<br />\nthere could be no permanent peace<br />\nWithout consideration of these forces.<br />\nIle Pointed to the Palestine refugee<br />\nProblem as the most pressing of the<br />\nlocal issues, claiming that Israel's<br />\ntreatment of the people who were<br />\ndisplaced by the 1967 war is one of the<br />\ninain roadblocks to a Mid-East<br />\nsettlement.<br />\nThe Arabs hold that the refugees<br />\nre an Israeli responsibility; that it is up<br />\nr\u0300O Israel, not the Arab states, to arrange<br />\nOr the disposition of these people. Mr.<br />\nMasri attacked Israel for refusin to<br /><br />\ndiscuss the refugees except in relation to<br />\na total settlement of the boundary<br />\ndisputes, a position the Arabs find<br />\n\u2022 unacceptable.<br />\nMr. Masri went on to condemn<br />\nIsrael's policies towards Arabs as<br />\n\"expansionist,\" claiming that the<br />\ncountry's policies \"threaten the<br />\nexistence of the territorial imperatives<br />\nof the neighboring states.\" He pointed<br />\nout that although the United Nations<br />\nResolution that officially divided<br />\nPalestine called for the area to be split<br />\nup 56% Israeli and 44% Arab, Israel has,<br />\nthrough warfare, managed to acquire<br />\n80% of the territory. He pictured Israel<br />\nas \"not satisfied with 80%\", and<br />\naccused the country of planning to<br />\nfurther expand its boundaries.<br />\nUnder these conditions the<br />\nspeaker felt that guerrilla activities<br />\nbecome inevitable. He said that the<br />\nArabs could not be expected to accept<br />\nthe Israeli seizure of their land, and that<br />\n\"occupation and resistance go<br />\ntogether.\" He compared the present<br />\nguerrilla attacks to similar actions<br />\nundertaken against the British by the<br />\nHaganah, and underground Zionist<br />\norganization that operated in Palestine<br />\nwhile it was still a protectorate of Great<br />\nBritain. Mr. Masri felt that any peace<br />\nproposals would have to be sanctioned<br />\nby the guerrilla groups to be effective.<br /><br />\nTaking Advantage<br />\nMr. Masri referred often to the<br />\npublic supposition that Israel is a<br />\nhelpless country surrounded by massive<br />\nArab strength. He pointed to the 1967<br />\nwar as evidence that the Arab nations<br />\nare, in reality, unable to stand up to the<br />\nIsraelis. He accused Israel of taking<br />\nadvantage of Arab weakness to gain new<br />\nterritory. He defended recent Arab<br />\nmilitary buildup as necessary for<br />\ndefense, adding that although the Arabs<br />\nhad been criticized for shelling Israeli<br />\nkibbutzes, the shells had actually been<br />\ndirected into an area that did not belong<br />\nto Israel and was being farmed against a<br />\nmutual demilitarization agreement.<br />\nMr. Masri said that the Arab<br />\nposition \"is very, very clear.\" They<br />\nwant a solution because \"if there is no<br />\nsolution war will break out again.\" He<br />\nclaimed that the Arabs have shown their<br />\nby Hoffmann willingness to negotiate and that it is<br />\nISRAEL WAS condemned and the Arabs were<br />\nnow up to Israel to choose. \"Territory<br />\nabsolved by Mr. Ham Marsi, Attache of<br />\nor peace-they cannot pursue both at<br />\nJordanian mission,in a speech here.<br />\nthe same time.\"<br /><br />\n91 111 4 4<br /><br />\n\u202211 1 Jr<br /><br />\nAt Homewood Seminar<br /><br />\nYehuda Avner, First<br />\nSecretary of the Israeli Embassy,<br /><br />\nstated in an informal seminar<br />\noutside Shaffer Hall last Sunday<br />\nthat \"the Big Four Powers are<br />\nmeddling in our affairs for their<br />\nown selfish interests.\"<br />\n\"We can remember the teachings<br />\nof history,\" he said, \"and it has taught<br />\nus that if two countries are in conflict,<br />\nthe only way to solve it is for those<br />\ncountries to sit down together. Those<br />\nwho have something to give and take<br />\nmust just sit down and work it out.\"<br />\nMr. Yehuda had moved the<br />\nlecture outside after only eight people<br />\nappeared. The lecture was originally<br />\nscheduled for Shaffer 3.<br />\n\"There are two points against the<br />\nBig Four conference,\" he said. \"One is<br />\npractice and, the other concerns Israeli<br />\ninterest. If we are to conclude the war,<br />\nwe must sit down with the Arabs.\"<br />\nThe First Secretary noted that<br />\nmany of today's problems may be<br />\nattributed to conflicts settled by<br />\nuninvolved parties.<br />\nMunich is Example<br />\n\"Munich is one example. In the<br />\nname of peace, England sold<br />\nCzechoslovakia to Germany. It was a<br />\nfake, it was false, but history books<br />\nstill tell us so.\"<br />\n\"You see,\" he continued,\"people<br />\nwho are not in the actual conflict just<br />\ndon't realize the implications of their<br />\nactions.\"<br />\nMr. Yehuda cited a second point<br />\nagainst the present Big Four<br />\nConference. \"Who is going to decide the<br />\nfate of Israel? There are four powers,<br />\nFrance, Russia, England and the United<br />\nStates. Russia and France totally<br />\nsupport the Arab countries, everything<br />\nthe Arabs want will be given to them by<br />\nthese two. England is going to the<br />\nconference but England is always sitting<br />\non the fence, and the United States,<br />\nalthough they think we are right, has its<br />\nown policy.<br />\n\"Hence, if there is any give and<br />\nthe conference, Israel will lose'<br />\nat<br />\ntake<br />\nbecause the United States will give<br />\nsomething they think is unimportant<br />\nwhile the others will fight only for the<br /><br />\nArabs.<br />\nMr. Yehuda noted that it is<br />\ndifficult to understand the Arab leaders<br />\nbecause they \"speak two languages, one<br />\nto the press and one to their people.\"<br />\nHe noted, as an example, the fact<br />\nIthat last week. Carnal Abdel Nassar,<br />\nPresident of Egypt, said that the only<br />\nsolution to the conflict he would accept<br />\nwas a return to conditions existing<br />\nbefore the Six Day War.<br />\n\"Practical Indications\"<br />\n\"We aren't going to be cheated by<br />\nthe press,\" Yehuda said. \"We think that<br />\n\u2022 the time for peace will come only when<br />\nArabs speak to their people the way<br />\n\u2022 they speak to the press.<br />\nWhen asked about the probable<br />\nconditions for the return of peace to the<br />\nMiddle East situation, Mr. Yehuda said<br />\n'that there must be some practical<br />\nindication of the Arabs' willingness to<br />\nnegotiate. \"We are going to sit down at<br />\na table and we will talk. But now we<br />\nhave something to give them back, we<br />\ncan offer peace and territory.\"<br />\nYehuda lamented the apparant<br />\nhardening of Arab policy. He said that it<br />\nnow looks as if the Arabs are further<br />\naway from a settlement today than they<br />\nwere at the end of the Six Day War.<br />\n\"Maybe it's because the Arabs didn't<br />\nsuffer in World War Two. They didn't<br />\ngo through what the Israeli people went<br />\nthrough. Maybe this is why we<br />\nemphasize peace more than they do.\"<br />\n\"But as much as we want peace,\"<br />\nhe continued,\"we will not just give into<br />\nthem in the name of peace.<br />\nFor purposes of argument,<br />\nYehuda divided the post-1947 era into<br />\ntwo periods: before the 1967 Six Days<br />\nWar, and the after effects of that war.<br />\nHe stated that, previous to the violent<br />\nengagements during the June War, Israel<br />\nhad little to offer in return for peace in<br />\nthe area.<br />\n\"This has all changed now. We can<br />\noffer them land and peace in return for<br />\npeace.\"<br />\nYehuda did state, however, that<br />\nthere are certain fundamental<br />\nconditions which Israel must consider.<br />\n\"We are now in a secure position and I<br />\ndo not think we dare jeopardize that<br />\nposition.\"<br /><br />\nPAGE 4<br /><br />\nHOMEWOOD,BALTIMORE, APRIL 18, 1969<br /><br />\nNEWS-LETTER<br /><br />\nU. Chicago Warns Against Student Disruptions<br />\nThe University of Chicago \\<br />\nAcademic Senate, in a letter sent<br />\nthis week to students who have<br />\nbeen accepted to its graduate<br />\nschool, warned that attempts to<br />\ndisrupt the University will be met<br />\nwith \"disciplinary action, not<br />\nexcluding expulsion.\"<br />\nIn the \"disruptive category,\" the<br />\nletter included all \"actions which<br />\nattempt to harass or coerce individual<br />\nmembers of the University community<br />\nor actions which deliberately interfere<br />\nwith the University's teaching activities,<br />\nresearch activities, or supportive<br />\nadministrative or operational activities,<br />\nin an effort to coerce .

Using this guideline there<br />\nare 151 segregated schools in the Baltimore area<br />\nthis year. Of these, 75 are entirely segregated.<br />\nThe increase leaves Baltimore with over<br />\n71% of its public schools essentially segregated<br />\nafter almost fifteen years since the United States<br />\nSupreme Court order for the desegregation of<br />\nschools.<br />\nElementary Schools<br />\nOf the totally segregated schools 64 are on<br />\nthe elementary level. This compares with 55<br />\nprimary schools that were entirely of one race<br />\nlast year. Of the total number of essentially<br />\nsegregated schools there are 121 elementary<br />\nschools in this category.<br />\nBaltimore has 192,170 students in the<br />\nschools, 125, 173 of whom are non-white. This<br />\ncompares with an almost one to one ratio of<br />\nwhites to blacks on the faculty level. There are<br />\n4,718 Negro teachers and 4,013 whites.<br />\nThere are 33 faculties in the school system<br />\nthat are totally segregated, a drop of 16 from last<br />\nyears 49. Using the government standard of<br />\n10-90 per cent, however, there are 20 additional<br />\nschools with segregated teacher staffs. Thus there<br />\nare 53 essentially segregated faculties.<br />\nNeighborhood Schools<br />\nThe large number of segregated elementary<br />\nschools is attributed to the fact that most of the<br />\nchildren on that level go to the nearest schools.<br />\nWith most of Baltimore's communities being of<br />\njust one race the schools on the primary level<br /><br />\ntend to reflect the color of its environment. Oil<br />\nthe junior high and high school levels the<br />\nstudents have the choice of going to whatevel<br />\nschool in the city they choose.<br />\nThe open enrollment policy that allows<br />\ncity's students to go where they want has led to<br />\novercrowding in some high schools that ate<br />\nconsidered to be a better quality than others.<br />\nThere has been considerable trouble will<br />\novercrowding in three of Baltimore's<br />\nschools. School Superintendent Dr. Robert vj<br />\nSheldon recently suggested that annexes be se;<br />\nup at other high schools in the city where e<br />\nstudent could go for a year before attending tliv,<br />\nactual school of his choice. Francis<br />\nMumaghan, Jr., president of the school boar\u00b0<br />\nrecommended that the annexes be set up at les'<br />\ncongested schools.<br />\nPlan's Success<br />\nThe basis for the plan's success rests 111)\u00b0,s1ti<br />\nthe students being willing to go to a school novoi<br />\nof their choosing but rather another high sch d<br />\nunder the guise of being an annex of the sch\u00b0<br />\nthey do wish to attend.<br />\nOf the 14 schools that are tot,/<br />\nsegregated thirteen became so because of a Slur,<br />\nOf just two or three students. Thus, last yeacie<br />\nthese schools were substantially of one raf,e<br />\naccording to the federal standards. The<br />\nschool, Benjamin Banneker Elementary, that Da ,<br />\nclose to a substantial number of the ininori.t)<br />\nfe<br />\ngroup last year also dropped an entlai<br />\nenrollment.

The<br />\nsolution is not easy. Protests against Dow Chemical,<br />\nagainst<br />\nBarton Hall, against the poor quality of concerts<br />\nin recent<br />\nyears are only an indication of a larger and<br />\nmuch more vital frustration which is prevalent on this<br />\ncampus. The<br />\nStudent Council in the last few years has<br />\nbeen guilty of a lack of relevance to the real needs of<br />\nstudent life. The valiant attempt this spring to institute<br />\ncalendar reform is a sign that perhaps at last the Student<br />\nCouncil can do something of value for the students it<br />\nserves.<br />\nThe oppostition on the part of both the<br />\nadministration and the faculty to the proposal reveals<br />\n'he central cause of that frustration. We are told that we<br />\nare<br />\nsecond-class, that we can only admire from a<br />\ndistance the great minds on this campus. There is a<br />\nchronicfailure on the part of Dr. Gordon and of the<br />\nfaculty to realize that each student's commitment to this<br />\nuniversity is a great one. $15,000 and four years of life is<br />\nnothing to be scoffed at.<br />\nIf the University does not provide speakers, the<br />\nstudent Council must take. that initiative. The<br />\nsenhower<br />\niValue for Symposium must be made into a thing of<br />\nstudents. The Student Council must take the<br /><br />\nresponsibility for being the leaders and innovators of an<br />\nLevering Hall, a strong<br />\nincreased student life.<br />\nhope in the area of student activity, must be supported<br />\nand strengthened.<br />\nA professor I had freshman year said one day that<br />\ncollege should be an experiment in life styles. Many<br />\nthings could be said of Hopkins but that is not one of<br />\nthem. The Student Council must undertake the direction<br />\nand responsibility for such experiments. It must speak<br />\nloudly enough and long enough to be a real voice of its<br />\nstudents. And the students themselves must help. As a<br />\nmuch touted alumnus of Hopkins, John Barth, once<br />\nwrote,\"How can you stand not to be marvelous?\"<br /><br />\nJOHN GUESS<br />\nThe basic thrust of my campaign will be Student<br />\nCouncil-.Student Body Communication. The role of the<br />\nCouncil ideally is to reflect student opinion. Here at<br />\nJohns Hopkins, this hasnot been the case in practicality.<br />\nThe goal, as I see it, should be work toward making the<br />\nCouncil here truly responsive to student attitudes. To<br />\nthis end, I feel that the Student Council should take<br />\npublic stands on all University issues involving students.<br />\nFurthermore, more and more issues involving students<br />\nshould be put before referendum, in areas where the<br />\nUniversity intends to take action. The search, then, is for<br />\ngreater student voice through communication with the<br />\nStudent Council. There are no expectations of 100<br />\npercent response. The point which is most important<br />\nhere is that an effort will be made.<br />\nA candidate last year stated,\"A political platform<br />\nby definition must be direct, incisive, and specific.

A feeling that the Council<br />\ndoes indeed exist for the students' interests was felt. But<br />\nthe past few months has been just a beginning. The<br />\nfollowing, I feel, should be the issues of the upcoming<br />\ncampaign. My views reflect the new direction the<br />\nCouncil should begin to pursue.<br />\nAn all-school committee, consisting of students,<br />\nfaculty, and administrators should be established to<br />\ninvestigate the idea of a University Senate. A report<br />\nshould be made for distribution to the student body, in<br />\nthe attempt to clarify the issue for student referendum.<br />\nIn addition to substantiating its position on<br />\nLevering Hall, the Council should coordinate an<br />\norganized campaign to insure the well-being of countless<br />\nstudents in the Levering program.<br />\nA number of committees should be organized,<br />\ncomposed of representatives from each class, to meet at<br />\nleast twice a year with faculty members in a series of<br />\nDepartment Curriculum Meetings, to advise on course<br />\nframework and aid in term scheduling.<br />\nTo insure more Comnzunication with the Student<br />\nCouncil, a half-hour Student Council Report should be<br />\ngiven once a week over WJHU. In addition the N-L<br />\nshould be given, for printing at the beginning of the<br />\nyear, the names of all Committees where students have<br />\nvoice, and the students on them.<br />\nStudent Council support should also be heavily<br />\ngiven to the CISF suggestions on Snack Bar<br />\nimprovements.<br />\nFinally, the Student Council should promote<br />\nwholeheartedly greater Athletic Support through an<br />\nenlarged Athletic Department budget to support minor<br />\nsports.<br /><br />\nand those who do not.<br />\n\"On its Face\"<br />\nSpecifically referring to Section<br />\n411, Dr. Gordon charged that the<br />\nprovision, \"on its face,\" leaves no<br />\ndiscretion in administrating the<br />\nlaw to the university.<br />\nSection 411 expires on June 30<br />\nof this year, and Dr. Gordon<br />\nurged Finch to oppose iis<br />\nre-enactment.<br />\nIn dealing with Section 504,<br />\nDr. Gordon's criticism of that act<br />\nrested on what he seemed to feel<br />\nwas the extraneous nature of the<br />\nlaw.<br />\n\"It is difficult for me to<br />\nenvisage a situation in which an<br />\nindividual could be guilty of<br />\nsufficiently serious disruptive<br />\naction to warrant the application<br />\nof these sanctions without at the<br />\nsame time having his connection<br />\nwith the University suspended or<br />\nterminated.\"<br />\nIn such a case, obviously,<br />\nstudents would automatically<br />\nlose federal aid.<br />\nIn discussing the evolution of<br />\nstudent disciplinary procedure at<br />\nHopkins, Dr. Gordon stated that a<br />\njoint committee of<br />\nadministration, faculty and<br />\nstudents, as well as representatives<br />\nfrom the school-wide University<br />\nCouncil, has been involved in<br />\ndeliberations for a long period of<br />\ntime.<br />\nMembers of the Student<br />\nConduct committee are Dean<br />\nAllyn Kimball, Vice President<br />\nWilliam Bevan, Director of<br />\nStudent Affairs Robert Bilgrave.<br />\nDr. Jon Liebman of<br />\nEnvironmental Engineering, Dr.<br />\nJohn Mann of Education, Francis<br />\nMunley, a graduate student, and<br />\nundergraduates Russell Passarella<br />\nand Bill Betcher, of the Student<br />\nCouncil.<br />\nFinch's letter was released over<br />\nthe weekend of March 23,<br />\ncoupled with a strong statement<br />\nby President Richard Nixon on<br />\ncampus disorders.<br />\nFinch, in his letter, told college<br />\nadministrators that \"the burden<br />\nof administration falls upon the<br />\ninstitutions.\"<br /><br />\nVianterburt)ZateO\"<br />\nif$ a htiA1),itatjaW<br />\ninWicat,add)uprottriouOtti<br />\ntip a nierrit)cat'<br />\n\u2014Brooks Atkinson<br />\nYU Mob,Neard &amp;am.<br /><br />\nTales<br /><br />\nORIGINAL BROADWAY CAST<br />\n1.\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022<br /><br />\nGEORGE HERMIONE MARTYN<br />\nROSE BADDELEY GREEN<br />\nMM<br /><br />\nSMOr<br /><br />\nID<br /><br />\nROY<br /><br />\nSW-229<br /><br />\nCOOPER EVANKO DUNCAN GARDNER<br />\nIVY<br /><br />\nBAOCI<br /><br />\nIN<br /><br />\nCAM T1<br /><br />\nPAGE HYDE STEFFE SMITH<br />\nII<br />\n\\ SHAW SH 6LTON ENMEN<br /><br />\nic<br /><br />\nVARY<br /><br />\nDAND<br /><br />\nMICHAELS THOMAS<br />\n...MARTIN STARKIE.NEVILL COGH111.<br /><br />\n_RICHARD HILL<br /><br />\nJOHN HAWKINS<br />\n\u2014.NEVILL COGHILL<br /><br />\nN\u2014CA<br /><br />\n\u2014.MARTIN STARK<br />\n-.<br />\nSAMMY RAYI S<br />\nOSCAR %MARIN<br /><br />\nLOUDON SAMIRRI.<br /><br />\nHear the Merry Original Broadway Cast<br />\n9<br />\nAlbum,now on Capitol! $<br /><br />\n34<br /><br />\navailable at<br /><br />\nTHE JOHNS HOPKINS BOOK CENTER<br />\nAP<br /><br />\nPAGE 6<br /><br />\nNEWS-LETTER<br /><br />\nHOMEWOOD,BALTIMORE, APRIL 18, 196.<br /><br />\nStudents Scrutinize Landlords<br /><br />\nHopkins,Morgan Begin<br />\nCo-operative Seminars<br /><br />\nA group of sociology students,<br />\nheaded by Kermit Baker, has completed a<br />\nlist of all Baltimore , residential buildings<br />\nsouth of 25th Street.<br />\nThis information will be,the base for<br />\nfuture studies on housing conditions in<br />\nthe inner-city.<br />\nThe group now has 150,000 computer<br />\ncards stating the owner, address of the owner,<br />\nassessed value of the structure and land, and the<br />\nlocation of the house.<br />\nPercentage of absentee ownership, the<br />\nincidence of housing code violations in the<br />\nholdings of various slum landlords, and<br />\ncorrelations between evictions and housing code<br />\nviolations will be computed.<br />\nPressure on Slumlords<br />\nThe group hopes that making these<br />\nstatistics public will put pressure on the<br />\nirresponsible landlords to improve their services.<br />\nTenants might try to avoid renting from these<br />\nslumlords...<br />\nMark Forester and Dave Levien helped<br />\nBaker gather the information.

At times, in the past, we have found it hard to<br />\ntake the Council seriously; at times, we have found major faults with the<br />\nCouncil's attitudes, policies and procedures.<br />\nThis year, however, the fight over calendar reform proved to us that<br />\nconcern for a strong, progressive Council is important. With the current<br />\nlack of adequate means of student representation in the policy-making of<br />\nthe University, it is important to have a Student Council and an SC<br />\npresident who can work productively to bring about reforms demanded<br />\nby undergraduates.<br />\nIn comparison to past Council leaders, Russell Passarella has done a<br />\ncommendable job as SC president. The choice of his successor is a matter<br />\nwhich should concern undergraduates.<br />\nWe find it unfortunate that only two candidates are running for the<br />\noffice of President. One candidate did not enter until it became clear that<br />\nonly one other student wanted the post. This seems to confirm our<br />\nCynical, but probably true, suspicion that the only undergraduates who<br />\nare even slightly concerned with problems of student affairs and student<br />\nrepresentation are those few who are elected to bother with such matters.<br />\nJudging by our knowledge of the two candidates, John Guess and<br />\nCook Goolrick, we could see fit to endorse either. Both express<br />\nProgressive attitudes towards the status and role of the undergraduate at<br />\nHopkins, and both, for once, are not examples of the hackneyed,<br />\nstereotyped student politician who usually abound in undergraduate<br />\nelections.<br />\nWe feel, however, that John Guess, a sophomore who has served on<br />\nthe Council, Black Student Union, and the Student Association, is the<br />\nmore qualified of the two. In the past few weeks, Guess has been working<br />\non ideas and policies to be instituted if elected, and has been scouring the<br />\ncampus to find qualified students to assist both the Council and himself,<br />\nas President. We have heard him specifically outline his attitudes towards<br />\nstudent government and issues at Hopkins, and we find ourselves in<br />\nagreement with many of his points.<br />\nWe urge all students to vote for John Guess next week; more<br />\nbasically, however, we urge all students to vote.<br /><br />\nYOU 50-r YOUR HIS-MY/<br /><br />\nWHIT HISTORY!<br /><br />\n\"Now that we've learned to talk, let's not speak in vague generalities.\"<br /><br />\nPay As You Go<br />\nThe decision of the university, announced by Dr. Gordon, to charge<br />\na $2 admission fee to the Hopkins - Navy lacrosse game is regrettable; yet,<br />\nat the same time, it is both justified and necessary.<br />\nDr. Gordon's statement made it clear that the receipts from the<br />\ngame are going to be used to defray the cost of constructing an additional<br />\n4,800 seats at Homewood Field. At times, attendance for important<br />\nHomewood games has neared '10,000 if the count includes potential fans<br />\nwho could not get in or who stayed away due to the lack of seating room.<br />\nThe additional seats will double the present capacity of Homewood Field,<br />\nand we feel that this is a service worth paying for.<br />\nOur only doubts concerning Dr. Gordon's announcement concern<br />\nthe possibility of charging admission to other games in certain Hopkins<br />\nsports. The admission fee policy sliould be used discriminately \u2014 in<br />\ninstances where it is not crucial to charge for admission, ticket sales<br />\nshould not be instituted.<br /><br />\nMoral Uplift<br />\nWe feel it our duty to remind those who haven't heard of the<br />\nupcoming Decency Rally, this Sunday, in Memorial Stadium. If we know<br />\nBaltimore, there will be a large crowd on hand fresh from a King Family<br />\nconcert and ready to answer Hyman Pressman's call-to-arms.<br />\nWe would hope that the organizers of the Decency. Rally will not let<br />\nan outstanding Hopkins individual go unnoticed. As our contribution to<br />\nwholesomeness, we would like to offer the name of Dennis Estis, former<br />\nNews-Letter editor and Adams housemaster. Mr. Estis struck a blow for<br />\nabove-the-board male-female relations last week, when he diligently<br />\nturned in a Hopkins freshman for having a girl in Baker House at 12:30<br />\na m. on a weekday night.

Do you see how this can be remedied?<br />\nDELLINGER : One of the Movement goals should<br />\nbe to create an egalitarian society of human community,<br />\nof human fraternity, which operates in economic and<br />\nother areas.<br />\nIt i false to think that a movement can create<br />\nsomething essentially different from itself, essentially<br />\ndifferent from the practices of human relationships that<br />\nit develops, that it experiences in its daily struggle.<br />\nTherefore, people in the Movement should not live lives<br />\nthat are dominated by the search for profit, the search<br />\nfor a higher material standard of living than other<br />\npeople.<br />\nIt's not that it is so scandalous to be middle class in<br />\none's origins and orientations, but people who become<br />\nacquainted with the vast extent of suffering and injustice<br />\nin the world will naturally seek out some kind of alliance<br />\nwith people who are not middle class. I hope that atleast after the initial impulse in that direction, it will not<br />\nbe based just on guilt or attachment to the victim, but<br />\nwill represent a real movement to learn from and also<br />\ncontribute to, to exchange ideas, experiences, attitudes,<br />\norganizing activities with these other people.<br />\nBlack Vanguard<br />\nThis has happened already between the black and<br />\nwhite movements in this country. It has been an erratic<br />\nprocess, and for all the good motivation of the early civil<br />\nrights activity, the relationships did tend to be<br />\ninegalitarian, they did tend to involve often unconscious<br />\ncondescension on the part of the white people, and a<br />\nwhole conditioned reflex of attitudes on the part of the<br />\nblack people toward the white.

A lot of<br />\nthe education that we are getting comes from the black<br />\npeople, who are the vanguard of the American<br />\nmovement.<br />\nThis doesn't mean that they are not without their<br />\nmistakes, their flaws, but they certainly add very much<br />\nto and correct the white middle class experience.<br />\nNEWS-LETTER: Do you then support the SDS in their<br />\ndrive to form a coalition with workers' groups and labor<br />\nunions?<br />\nGreater<br />\ngeneral terms, yes.<br />\nDELLINGER: , In<br />\ninteraction between students and workers is very<br />\nimportant. But I think that it is important that the<br />\nstudents not repeat the mistake of the Civil Rights<br />\nmovement, of going to the workers with either a<br />\nphilantropic attitude on the one hand, or a kind of guilt<br />\ncomplex that leads them to be uncritical and unequal in<br />\ntheir relationships with the workers.<br />\nOut-Blacking Blacks<br />\nthe South in 1963, one of the things<br />\nin<br />\nwas<br />\nWhen I<br />\nthat impressed me was not just the superficial and<br />\ncondescending attitude of the whites at some points, the<br />\nunconscious assumption that they could somehow<br />\nunderstand the black person's problems and give<br />\npolitical leadership and assume important posts.<br />\nBut there was another tendency also, by which white<br />\ncollege students went into the South and tried to<br />\nout-black the blacks in a way which meant that they<br />\nwere so consumed by their attraction to the black<br />\npeople, this strange foreign world to them, that they<br />\nsurrendered their individuality and their identity as<br />\npeople. 1 think that their uncritical aping of the blacks,<br />\ntaking on black mannerisms and black customs, was<br />\ngood for neither the black people nor for them.<br />\nIn certain sections of SDS and Progressive Labor there<br />\nare times when I see a repetition of this attitude: the<br />\nworkers are automatically correct, the workers are<br />\nautomatically the vanguard. When the fact is that, while<br />\nthe workers in this country in a lot of areas have healthy<br />\npolitical instincts and responses, in other areas and in<br />\nother ways they have been corrupted by the society in<br />\nwhich they live and are not in any way active as the<br />\nvanguard.

B. King album is an<br />\nImportant event. As the trite but true cliche says,<br />\neveryone is going back to his roots. And those roots<br />\nare planted in either the Nashville<br />\ncountry and western<br />\ntradition or in Mississippi delta blues.<br />\nTypifying the latter style is B. B. King. Most people<br />\nknow the story of his hard life - twenty years of<br />\n\"e-nighters in back alley ghetto cellars or backwoods<br />\nPine .shacks, then the beginnings of long-delayed<br />\nice\u00b0<br />\nWhitgenition in the wake of such big-time big<br />\n-money<br />\nguitarists as Clapton and Bloomfield. And if we<br />\nare to believe the usual extravagant liner notes, this new<br />\nalbum (His Best-The<br />\nElectric B. B. King) will finally<br />\nelevate him to his deserved stardom.<br />\nHowever, this record just won't do it. It is not his<br />\nbest, and is hardly electric at all. My complaint is<br />\nnot<br />\nWith B. B. King; he is still the King of the Blues, still a<br />\nfantastic guitarist. But if he wants a reputation as such,<br />\nhe should<br />\nput out a blues album with beaucoup de guitar<br />\nWork.<br />\nThe first song, \"Tired of Your Jive,\" is probably the<br />\nWorst, partly because of its numerous inherent defects,<br />\nbut<br />\nbecause it is the first (and very disappointing)<br />\nalsote one receives of King after dashing<br />\nfrom the<br />\nookstore to a record player with this album. Brutal and<br />\nunmoral surgery has been performed<br />\non King's voice,<br />\nem<br />\nasculating it. He sounds smooth, easy, feminine, very<br />\ncommercial<br />\niconlmc<br />\n- like an endless procession of Tony Bennett<br />\nook- and'<br />\n-soundlik<br />\non the Ed Sullivan Show.<br />\nProducer Johnny Pate<br />\nor some clown in the studio has<br />\ntransmogrified the King of the Blue into<br />\nthe Buffoon<br />\nof the<br />\nBroadway Show Tunes.<br />\nThe foul injustice wreaked on King's vocal abilities<br />\nWould perhaps be tolerable if confined<br />\nto one song; it is<br />\nnot.<br />\nthe soundtrack of For Love of Ivy there are<br />\ntwo<br />\nbreonshorrendous<br />\n)rrendous songs that not even Archie Bell and the<br />\nwould do. \"Paying the Cost to be the Boss\"<br />\nsounded<br />\nbetter on television, a medium justly famous<br />\nfor<br />\nWeakening and/or destroying the performances of<br />\nelectric musicains. The second side is a welcome<br />\nlInProvement, but still not all it could be.<br />\nBeing an<br />\nadmitted guitar fanatic, I have not really<br />\nPaid<br />\nvoice much attention to King's powerful and passionnate<br />\nbefore. To paraphrase Jack Bruce, the words are<br /><br />\nB. B. King (left) and Lucille, with his back-up band, Sonny Freeman and the Unusuals.<br /><br />\nthere to begin and end the song. But now that a<br />\npapier-mache Perry Como has been nefariously<br />\nsubstituted for the Beale Street Blues Boy, I am aware<br />\nnot only of what I was missing before but of what is not<br />\nthere now on His Best.<br />\nThe only way to appreciate King's dynamic singing is<br />\nin concert, for there are no electronic castrators to come<br />\nbetween his vocal cords and the listener's ears. This<br />\npoint is painfully demonstrated by the inclusion of a live<br />\ncut, \"Sweet Sixteen,\" in which the raw growling<br />\nemotion of the real B. B. King is heard.<br />\nBut one can criticize \"Sweet Sixteen\" for the same<br />\nreason the whole album can be criticized: no guitar. In<br />\nthis era of intricate virtuosos, of 17-minute \"Spoonfuls,\"<br />\nwhy must King just tempt us with a modicum of the<br />\nhoneybitter notes in Lucille's vocabulary? There is more<br />\nguitar work on Live at the Regal, an album King<br />\nrecorded in 1964 (and still very exciting; like<br /><br />\nProjections, it is one of those few albums that have<br />\nsurvived the vicissitudes of musical fads.)<br />\nIn his present concert performances King devotes a<br />\ngood proportion of his efforts to Lucille, his guitar;<br />\nmud. more than on Live at the Regal. Perhaps he<br />\nrealizes what many in his new-found white audience<br />\ncome to him for. Unfortunately, his record company<br />\ndoes not. (Another example of this: I cannot imagine<br />\nAlbert King making Live Wire-Blues Power in a studio.)<br />\nIn \"Don't Answer the Door\" the haunting banshee<br />\nsounds of King's guitar are much in evidence, placed in<br />\nthe distant background for an odd but intriguing effect.<br />\nBut that's it, except for a few lamentably brief<br />\nintroductions and breaks. King wastes his talent by<br />\nplaying just a simple catchy riff in \"Think it Over\";<br />\nRobby Krieger could learn to do as well. The King's<br />\nregal powers (by Divine Right) seem to evaporate when<br />\nhe enters a studio.

Grant. Grant was<br />\nnarrowly elected in 1868, but he significantly improved<br />\nhis popular majority against the erratic Horace Greeley<br />\nin 1872.<br />\nIt was considered likely that he would seek a third<br />\nterm in 1876. However, the reformist Liberal<br />\nRepublicans, who had failed rather ignominiously after<br />\nobtaining Democratic acceptance of their Greeley<br />\ncandidacy, were gaining strength with increased<br />\nopposition to Grant's corrupt appointments and lack of<br />\nleadership. A House of Representatives resolution<br />\nconcerning the lack of wisdom in a President's serving<br />\nthree terms helped inhibit Grant's desire to seek<br />\nrenomination in 1876.<br />\n\"Best Obstacle\"<br />\nIn 1880, however, Senator Roscoe Conkling of New<br />\nYork fixed on Grant as the best obstacle to a<br />\nPresidential nomination for Conkling's chief Republican<br />\nrival, the charismatic James G. Blaine. Mr. Grant was in a<br />\nposition where the President's salary would be of<br />\nmaterial benefit to him, and he was willing to run.<br />\nConkling's excellent nominating speech indicated that as<br />\none chooses a physician on the basis of experience with<br />\nhim, so it would be foolhardy to deny the Presidency for<br />\nGrant merely because he had held the job before, since<br />\nhe had discharged the Presidency so well (sic).<br />\nGrant led on the early ballots, with Blaine a game and<br />\nrespectable second.

However, Harrison, grandson of the<br />\nHarrison who earlier defeated a Democratic incumbent<br />\nfor re-election, had more electoral votes and became<br />\nPresident.<br />\nSeeks Third Nomination<br />\nAfter four years in a prosperous law practice.<br />\nCleveland sought a third nomination in 1892. There was<br />\ncriticism of him as a \"perpetual candidate,\" but he<br />\nreceived nomination and, in another close race, defeated<br />\nPresident Harrison.<br />\nAs late as 1904, when there was a conservative<br />\nDemocratic reaction to two-time nominee William<br />\nJennings Bryan, Cleveland was considered a possibility<br />\nto run for President. Cleveland did not actively<br />\nencourage this movement, but he was enthusiastic over<br />\nthe Democrats' choice of New York State Chief Justice<br />\nAlton B. Parker. A thorough supporter of Cleveland.<br />\nParker was opposed by Bryan as late as 1912, when each<br />\nsought the post of Temporary Chairman of the<br />\nDemocratic National Convention. Despite Cleveland's<br />\nbacking, as exemplified in a magazine article, 'Justice<br />\nParker was buried in November.<br />\nTheodore Roosevelt, who achieved a record majority<br />\nagainst Justice Parker, immediately announced that he<br />\nwould not seek re-election.

If one is doing the thing that needs to be done,<br />\nand has not lost his focus (working on a definite object),<br />\nthen I think that one has to chance the backlash or face<br />\nup to it.<br />\nI also think that the rhetoric of violence does harm in<br />\nthat it adds a kind of spurious romance to the<br />\nMovement, and that very often discourages people from<br />\ngoing through the very hard political analysis of goals,\u2022<br />\nstrategy, and tactics which is required.

Wherever possible it would like to blur over<br />\nthe fact of repression, particularly on places like college<br />\ncampuses. But it is a little early in the Nixon<br />\nAdministration, plus there are other factors, such as<br />\nwhat happens on the battlefield in Vietnam and in Paris,<br />\nwhich will have an influence on the extent to which they<br />\nare willing and able, or able to get away with, overt<br />\nrepression.<br />\nI do believe that the war cannot be maintained at<br />\nits present level without some fairly extreme forms of<br /><br />\nrepression being introduced. This is one of the reasons<br />\nthat the Administration is going to try to resolve the<br />\nwar, not really handle it the way it should be, but<br />\nnonetheless patch-up some sort of face-saving peace, so<br />\nthat it will not get into the position of having to<br />\ninstitute a rather extensive repression.<br />\nN-L: What visible effects have the Paris peace talks had,<br />\nboth on the Movement and the American people as a<br />\nwhole?<br />\nDELLINGER: The immediate effect of them was to<br />\ncreate the illusion that the government had made a turn<br />\ntoward peace. And although it might be annoyingly<br />\nslow, ending the war was on the way. Given all the<br />\ncompetition, the time and energy and all the<br />\ninconveniences, like having your head beaten in by the<br />\npolice, there was a natural tendency for people to hold<br />\nback, not to support the war, but simply to refrain from<br />\ndemonstrations.<br />\nThis effect was compounded by the fact that the<br />\nMovement had come to a period of tactical confusion,<br />\nwhen it was obvious that new methods were needed. It<br />\nwas kind of difficult for people to figure out what these<br />\nnew methods were. So between the boredom that had<br />\ndeveloped with demonstrations, and the idea that the<br />\npeace talks were on the way, and although they might<br />\ndrag on they will lead to peace, there has been a<br />\ntendency for a lot of people to opt out or just hold<br />\nback.<br /><br />\nBut we have begun to enter a new period.

Whether or not a<br />\nbook is placed in the cage is<br />\ndeterminated by the opinions of the<br />\nstaff filing the book,she explained.

He said, though, that' lie<br />\nknew of few instances where a student<br />\nasked for a book. In such a case, \"We<br />\nwould take it under advisement.\"<br />\nCurrent literature outside the<br />\nacademic program is offered in a special<br />\nX collection on the main floor.

Both the planned<br />\nincorporation of Levering Hall into the<br />\nOffice of Student Affairs and the<br />\nreluctance to grant tenure to the<br />\nUniversity Chaplain seem to us to derive<br />\nfrom a number of assumptions we<br />\nwould like to question.

The successful continuance<br />\nof this undertaking is greatly dependent<br />\non the continued independence of<br />\nLevering Hall.<br />\nThis independence must further<br />\nbe insured by a realistic assessment of<br />\nthe role of the Chaplain within the<br />\nUniversity. The Chaplain's duties are<br />\nnot of an administrative nature alone,<br />\nnor are they limited to the performance<br />\nof perfunctory prayers at University<br />\nfunctions and the provision of ersatz<br />\npsychiatry. The Chaplain's freedom of<br />\nconscience and the ability to express the<br />\ndictates of that conscience must be<br />\nprotected as strongly as the professors<br />\nright to pursue truth and speak his<br />\nmind.

The following discourse between the<br />\nNews-Letter and Baltimore Mayor Thomas D'A lesandro,<br />\nIII was conducted this week. Ellipses denote the end of<br />\neach excerptfrom the interview.<br />\nNews-Letter: At this point in your administration,<br />\nhow would you assess your ability to relate to the<br />\nvarious elements of the black community, to recognize<br />\nthe relevant spokesmen of that community, and deal<br />\nWith its problems?<br />\nD'Alesandro: I feel very confident in dealing with<br />\nalmost every segment of the black community. At the<br />\ngovernmental level, with the elected officials from the<br />\nblack community, the Councilmen, and those whom I've<br />\nappointed to various boards and commissions.<br />\nDown in the neighborhoods, I've gotten close to the<br />\nPeople through my Job Bank, and my outreach<br />\nprograms to solicit the hard-core unemployed for gainful<br />\nemployment. There's where I've gotten the best rapport.<br />\nI cut through all of the recognized layers of<br />\nleadership...and I get right down to the people eyeball to<br />\neyeball, so to speak.<br />\nIn last summer's program, we've been able to process<br />\nClose to 8600 young men and women into jobs. In my<br />\ntours, I try to meet and talk with as many of them as I<br />\ncan. I try as best I can to make as many speaking<br />\nengagements to the little churches and the little<br />\nneighborhood councils or improvement associations, so<br />\nthat the people can get to see me,and at the same time,<br />\nSO I can see them.<br />\nOn those particular occassions, I try to allow some<br />\ntime so that I can at least spend an hour milling around<br />\nthe neighborhood and milling around with the people.<br />\nI try to relate at the grass roots level. As a result of<br />\nthis experience, I find that there is a tremendous amount<br />\nof black people who really have no one speaking for<br />\nthem. In some instances, they are living under very<br />\ntough conditions, economically. I go down there and try<br />\nto tie it up\u2014their wishes with an opportunity<br />\n.<br />\nsee coming some fine, strong, responsible Negro<br />\nleadership. I think the young man that I appointed to<br />\nthe School Board\u2014Larry Gibson\u2014is a real comer and is<br />\ngaining attention in the neighborhoods.<br />\nI think that the Ministerial Alliance has become more<br />\nactive. The representatives in the Urban Coalition are<br />\nsolid men. I find more activity now in the black<br />\ncommunity, as far as church and civic events are<br />\nconcerned...<br />\nI find that the only thing I can do is keep an open<br />\ndoor, and open mind, and have all segments of the<br />\ncommunity know that I'm willing to sit down, listen,<br />\nand talk with them. I hope, that as a result of this<br />\nattitude, the people feel that they have someone who is<br />\nConcerned about them here at City Hall.<br />\n.N-L: What do you think of the City Council's<br />\nrejection of a $64,000 0E0 grant destined for the<br />\nHopkins Student Association Tutorial Project?<br />\ntf Alesdandro: I'm in the process of trying, through<br />\namendments, to get that reconsidered. I was down in<br />\nAnnapolis on my special election bill the night that the<br />\nt!ling was delayed by the City Council. Since my return,<br />\nlye been talking to some of the Councilmen to find out<br />\nWhat their opposition was predicated on.<br /><br />\nSTUDENTS<br />\nGOOD HUMOUR needs part time<br />\nsalesman now \u2014 and full time<br />\nsalesmen through the Summer.<br />\nIf you can serve a GOOD<br />\nHUMOUR territory from NOW<br />\nTHROUGH MAY on<br />\nSATURDAYS AND SUNDAYS,<br />\nYou will average $25.00 per day in<br />\nCommissions - with a guaranteed<br />\nminimum in case of bad weather.<br /><br />\nI'm now in the process of seeing that, with the<br />\nappropriate amendments, this grant be reinstated in the<br />\nprogram. On the merits the program is a solid one. Who<br />\ncould argue with tutoring 600 inner city kids who need<br />\ntutoring? That speaks for itself. If the Councilmen have<br />\nany questions on collateral matters surrounding that,<br />\nwe'd have to take them into consideration. I'm working<br />\nnow on getting that reconsidered by the City Council<br />\nand I hope to do so quickly.<br />\nN-L: The same Tutorial Project and the rest of the<br />\nStudent Association is presently in jeopardy because of a<br />\npotential lack of University funding and the possibility<br />\nof a restructuring of authority for Levering Hall. In an<br />\naddress to the Hopkins community last September, you<br />\nlambasted the University for not becoming sufficiently<br />\ninvolved in the community. What do you see as the role<br />\nof an urban university?<br />\nD'Alesandro: Because we are the center of some fine<br />\neducational institutions, like Johns Hopkins and the rest,<br />\nI would like to see them allocate to me, as Mayor (or to<br />\nthe Governor, or the General Assembly, or the Council)<br />\nsome of their best brainpower\u2014not only faculty, but<br />\nstudents as well, on the order of the White House<br />\nFellowships...<br />\nThe fact that we hold public office doesn't give us any<br />\ncornerstone on knowledge. You can help us. You can<br />\nbegin to digest some of these probled we can get<br />\nthe benefits.<br />\n;Until I needle some of the colleges, the only time I<br />\nhave any contact with them is on graduation, or<br />\ninauguration, or if they call me out to make a speech to<br />\na class or assembly.<br />\nI'd like to have a real solid cadre of students who<br />\nwould be willing to learn some of the operations and the<br />\nproblems of government. For argument's sake, let's take<br />\nstudents in engineering. There's no reason why they<br />\ncouldn't be assigned to and given credit for work with<br />\nthe Department of Public Works,and see first hand some<br />\nof the problems that we are confronting in engineering.<br />\nThe same in the social services..1 like to take a bread<br />\nand butter approach. This is the way the situation can be<br />\nimproved.<br />\nN-L: How will the Nixon administration's plans to<br />\ndisperse the responsibilities of 0E0 among various<br />\nfederal departments and agencies effect the Baltimore<br />\nanti-poverty program?<br />\nD'Alesandro: 0E0 was a pilot project, a test tube,<br />\nspinning off Head Start to HEW makes sense. Even after<br />\nwe spin off Head Start to Education, we may have to<br />\nbetter our criteria by dropping the age even lower.<br />\nThe spin-off of some of the Job Corps programs and<br />\nManpower Training programs directly to the<br />\nresponsibility of Labor makes sense, as well.<br />\nThen, there are certain programs which are<br />\nstreet-oriented. These programs should be 'overseen by<br />\n0E0. Outreach programs, such as neighborhood centers,<br />\nought to be maintained.<br />\nI don't look at it as a question of the Johnson<br />\nAdministration or the Nixon Administration doing this<br />\nor doing that to 0E0. I look at it from the broad<br />\npicture.<br />\n0E0 is a laboratory where we test new pilot projects,<br />\nand place them where they can get the best<br /><br />\nYou keep Flunking<br />\nyour best subject?<br /><br />\nALL EQUIPMENT FURNISHED.<br />\nVOL!

That would be<br />\nthe danger.<br />\nN-L: Would you explain your feelings on the<br />\nchallenge put forth by the Black City Council to the<br />\nCity Council when the insurgent group took over the<br />\nCouncil Chambers?<br />\nD'Alesandro: We had a hearing ,on a pool room bill<br />\nupstairs (in Council Chambers) in which responsible<br />\nelements. of some of the neighborhoods appeared in<br />\nopposition. They had legitimate comments . and<br />\ncriticisms to make of the pending legislation. And after<br />\neverything is said and done, that is what the hearing was<br />\nfor.<br />\nThen some rough and rowdy groups intermingled and<br />\nturned the meeting into a vehicle to demean the<br />\nCouncilment and lash out at them. When the Council<br />\nadjourned its meeting, they came down to see me.<br />\nI was in a meeting with Model Cities, but as I said, my<br />\ndoor is always open. When they came in to see me, they<br />\ntold me that they were just appointed the Black City<br />\nCouncil, they demanded a meeting, and they treated me<br />\nwith complete disrespect.<br />\nNot for me, Tommy D'Alesandro\u2014I'm incidental\u2014but<br />\nfor the office I hold. I represent all the people of<br />\nBaltimore...<br />\nI consider that whole effort one of the most<br />\ndepressing scenes I've witnessed as Mayor, because I<br />\ndon't believe they represent any element.<br />\nI'm a product of politics. I was born and raised in<br />\npolitics. I'm not the Mayor of Baltimore because I want<br />\nto be the Mayor of Baltimore to satisfy my own<br />\nambitions or desires. I had to go out there and carry<br />\nprecincts. I had to campaign. I served five years as the<br />\nCouncil President.<br />\nI worked to get this job. I didn't come in and say,<br />\n\"Well, I'm:now the Mayor\" The system is big enough to<br />\nreject anybody who's in the job and not doing the job. If<br />\nyou say you're representing the people, the people will<br />\nelect you.<br />\nN-L: Mayor Lindsay of New York has had a great deal<br />\nof difficulty maintaining control of city agencies. Have<br />\nyou experienced similar problems?<br />\nD'Alesandro: No, the size of the city dictates the<br />\nmeasure of control. I think Lindsay has more sanitation<br />\nworkers than I have all city employees.<br />\nHis municipal government is too big, and it is<br />\nstructured in such a way that Mayors come and Mayors<br />\ngo, but the bureaucracy stays. He's swimming up against<br />\nNiagara Falls. The question of decentralization\u2014there's no<br />\nquestion. That's the answer in the final analysis. More<br />\nborough strength maybe.<br />\nBaltimore is such a closely knit city with such a<br />\nclosely knit municipal operation, that not only do I have<br />\ncontrol in the sense that I know what's going on and can<br />\ndictate some policy, but I really know a hell of a lot of<br />\npeople down the line\u2014not only the department heads<br />\nand supervisors, but all the way down the line to the<br />\nlaboring level.<br />\nCustom and tradition dictate a lot.

This organization, although limited<br />\nand very selective in membership (I speak from personal.<br />\nexperience. I was rejected by the Board twice) is perhaps<br />\nthe most active and constructive student group on campus.<br />\nCharged with the responsibility of running the school's<br />\nintramural program, the BIA is constantly searching for new and<br />\nimproved ways to better competition. This year's Board under Gene<br />\nDetroyer's responsible guidance and Col. Serena's ex'cellent<br />\nsupervision has reached new peaks of success.<br />\nSuch innovations as the divisional system in major sports<br />\nmeans increased participation, less forfeits, and more evenly<br />\nscheduled games all during regular season play. The one drawback to<br />\nthis is lopsided play-off arrangement. Yet,inevitably, the best teams<br />\nhave made it to the Finals. There isn't a more equitable league or<br />\ndivisional system than the one presently used. Division placement<br />\nhas been based on a team's past performance in that particular sport.<br />\nBIA Increases Participation.<br />\nOther commendable innovations have been the increased<br />\nparticipation in both squash and handball (each house was allowed<br />\nto enter three in each sport instead of one) the expansion of<br />\nvolleyball from more than a one night affair, and the addition of a<br />\nbilliards tournament. Thus a wider spectrum of interested students<br />\ncan find feasible outlets for their competitive spirit.<br />\nPersonally, I would like to see a soccer league or tournament<br />\nas well as a water polo tournament added to the schedule next fall.<br />\nAlso at some time in the future when the gym facilities are complete<br />\nand the necessary precautions can be taken a BIA Boxing<br />\nTournament might be added. Presently, there are a number of<br />\nHopkins students who do spar on their own, and this would give<br />\nthem something to shoot and train for.<br />\nDespite the success of this year's BIA Program, a number of<br />\nrough spots have yet to be smoothed over. Due to the insistance of<br />\nBIA-member Dave Hooper, several organizational meetings were held<br />\nto hash out these problems. The most salient of these were a needed ,<br />\nrevision of rules and scoring procedures, the dissemenatination of<br />\ninformation to teams, and the training of good refs. In trying to<br />\nmeet these and other problems, the BIA sees the need for set rules<br />\nbut also the need for flexibility.<br />\nProblems Always Will Exist<br />\nThese problems in some degree or other will always exist, but<br />\nthey can be lessened. Meanwhile, the Board sees other possible<br />\nproblems in the future which they must also meet. One example that I<br />\ncomes to mind is the situation that the new calendar will create.<br />\nHopefully, the deplorable situation of lack of both playing<br />\nfields and money to run the program effectively will be eliminated<br />\nby favorable administration action before the beginning of classes ;<br />\nnext September. Fields are already being laid out down in Wyman<br />\nPark, and a substantial increase in the BIA's budget will ease matters.<br />\nThese moves cannot help but to improve the general success of the<br />\nprogram.<br />\nThe BIA plans to hold freshman interviews in the upcoming<br />\nweeks. We encourage all interested freshman to apply. Admittedly<br />\nnot everyone that applies will be accepted, but it is definitely worth<br />\ntrying for. There is nothing worse than a defeatist attitude; such as<br />\nnot applying because one believes or has been told that the BIA is<br />\ncontrolled by one or several fraternities. These accusations might<br />\nhave had truth in the past, but they just aren't true today.<br /><br />\nIn what coach Bob Scott called \"by<br />\nfar our best game of the season\", the<br />\nHopkins lacrosse team overcame its most<br />\nformidable opponent to date by crushing<br />\nVirginia 15-4, before an SRO crowd of<br />\n6,500 Saturday at Homewood.<br />\nThe match up had been advertised as<br />\nthe first major clash of unbeaten lacrosse<br />\nteams this season, but the Blue Jays<br />\nquickly established their superiority by<br />\nramming in five goals before the Cavaliers<br />\ncould tally. In running their two-season<br />\nwin streak to 15, the stickmen played<br />\nnearly flawless ball control to dominate<br />\nthe first quarter and set the tone for the<br />\ngame.<br />\nAll-American attackman Joe Cowan<br />\nstarted the scoring barrage at 3:48 of the<br />\ninitial period when he kicked in a<br />\nrebound. Cowan assisted midfielders<br />\nCharlie Coker and Charles Goodell, and<br />\nattackmen Jim Feely and Stu Kahl scored<br />\nunassisted to amass a 5-0 lead before<br />\nVirginia Freshman Bob Proutt scored at<br />\n13:33 of the first period. Coker took a<br />\npass from Feely to open the<br />\nsecond-quarter scoring, and another<br />\nVirginia freshman, Jay Connor, countered<br />\nwith a rebound goal at 1:29 of the same<br />\nperiod.<br />\nSterling Defense<br />\nHowever, for the remainder of the second<br />\nquarter, all of the third, and the first 11 minutes<br />\nof the fourth - a total of 39% minutes - Hopkins'<br />\nsterling defense completely smothered the<br />\nCavalier offense. Meanwhile, the Jays deluged<br />\nVirginia with nine markers to turn the game into<br />\na rout.<br />\nVirginia's close defense, called in the<br />\nscouting report \"the best...ever seen\", was<br />\nparticularly ineffective in the crucial opening<br />\nperiod as the Hopkins stickhandlers thoroughly<br />\ndominated possession of the ball. The Cavaliers,<br />\nonly major lacrosse team to play freshmen on<br />\ntheir varsity (the adoption of this policy<br />\nprompted Army to drop Virginia from its<br />\nschedule in protest), was impotent against an<br />\noverpowering defense led by All-Americans Mike<br />\nClark, who shut off Connor with repeated checks<br /><br />\nand steals, and John Cardillo, a massive Long<br />\nIslander. Senior goaltender John Kelly, who<br />\nrepulsed 10 Virginia shots, was removed in the<br />\njob<br />\nlast quarter to a well-deserved ovation. Hisclose<br />\nwas made considerably easier by the<br />\ndefense, which not only limited Virginia to 28<br />\nshots, but executed some beautiful clears as well.<br />\nCharlie Coker, a junior middie, played his fines!,<br />\ngame of the year with four goals and a pair 01<br />\nassists; Cowan, the nonpareil attackman,<br />\nwhipped the Cavaliers' All-American defensernan<br />\nPete Coy time and time again, often enoughantO,<br />\npop in two goals and set up three others;<br />\nclassy<br />\nmidfielder Russ Moore displayed some<br />\nstickwork as he led both teams in ground balls.<br /><br />\nri<br />\nSI<br />\nuj<br />\nle<br />\nth.<br />\nPe<br />\n19<br />\nJur<br />\nJur<br />\nCO<br />\nsee<br />\nSc<br />\nthr,<br />\nthe<br />\nrest<br /><br />\nPotent Offense<br /><br />\n?41c1<br />\nThe potent Blue Jay offense pepper the<br />\nVirginia goalie Jim Eustace and his replacement 100<br />\nAl Hirsch with a staggering total of 68 shots,<br />\nincluding a double-pipe hit which wasn't credited<br />\nas a goal.

Presently only faculty members can<br />\nvote on the disciplinary committees which<br />\nrecommended the expulsions and suspensions to Dean<br />\nO'Connell.<br />\nParticipants in the disorders were photographed in some<br />\ncases. In others, they were recognizedby faculty<br />\nmembers or members of the Dean's staff. The students<br />\nwere then issued summonses for hearings. Although the<br />\npolice were not called in during the Chicago disruptions,<br />\nthe university expelled more students than Columbia,<br />\nBerkeley and San Francisco State combined.<br /><br />\nColumbia Occupied<br />\nA group of 20 black students occupied a Columbia<br />\nUniversity office on Monday to back their demands for a<br />\ngreater voice in the recruitment and admission of<br />\nNegroes to the institution.<br />\nThe black students accused the university of<br />\nhaving been \"systematically racist and oppressive in its<br />\nrelations with black people.\" They demanded that black<br />\nstudents be given the power to nominate an admission<br />\nboard and an admission staff that would recruit, admit<br />\nand help finance Negro students.<br />\nThe university rejected the demands, asserting that<br />\nColumbia already has a consulting board on black and<br />\nPuerto Rican admissions and will admit about twice the<br />\nnumber of black freshmen this year as last.<br />\nThe protest caught the faculty, administration and<br />\nthe S.D.S. by surprise. The faculty and administration<br />\nhad been under the impression that important progress<br />\nwas being made in a series of talks with the black<br />\nstudents about admissions policies and the creation of an<br />\nAfro-American studies program at Columbia.<br />\nDr. Andrew Cordier, the acting president, had<br />\nbeen regularly meeting with black students for weeks in<br />\nan attempt to work out what he has described as \"the<br />\nstrongest, soundest, academically best based Afro-American studies program in the country.\"<br /><br />\nDissent Confirmed<br />\nThe trustees of Catholic University of America<br />\n\"officially received\" a report that emphatically<br />\nvindicates the action of theologians on the university's<br />\nfaculty who publically dissented last summer from Pope<br />\nPaul's birth-control encyclical.<br />\nup by a board of inquiry after<br />\nThis report, di<br />\nseVen months of investigation, defends<br />\nuncompromisingly the full academic freedom of the<br />\nCa tholic theologians.<br />\nIt draws a sharp line between the functions of<br />\nbishops and theologians, and asserts that professors in<br />\ncontroversy should be judged by other professors in<br />\ntheir field and not by bishops. In fact, the report noted,<br />\ninterference by bishops in the academic sphere has a<br />\n\"devastating effect.\"<br />\nMost religions observers agree that never before<br />\nhas such an influential Catholic academic body in this<br />\ncountry backed so firmly a strong defense of freedom of<br />\ninquiry and speech by theologians.<br />\nThe report states. \"The right of a theological<br />\nscholar to dissent from non-infallible teachings of the<br />\nmagisterium (teaching authority) is well documented.\"<br />\nIt fur t her says that \"the dissemination of the<br />\ntheologian's views through the public media was<br />\nu4voidable.\"<br /><br />\nB.U.

There was only one incident.<br />\nThe secretarial staffs of the two ejected officials<br />\ncomplained that fiey had been \"terrorized\" by the<br />\nstudents when asked to leave. The demonstrators denied<br />\nthe accusation.<br />\nAfter the building's takeover, the University<br />\nCouncil and the faculty Senate Council, at a joint<br />\nmeeting, unanimously voted support of a university<br />\nposition paper, released last month, which condemned<br />\ndemonstrations that interfered with educational<br />\nprocesses.<br />\nMembers of Young Americans for Freedom held a<br />\nrally later in the day condemning the anti-ROTC radicals<br />\nand urging the administration not to give in to their<br />\ndemands.<br /><br />\nMarine Corps Blues<br />\nGeneral Leonard F. Chapman, Jr., said that<br />\nanti-war opposition, sometimes in the form of physical<br />\nobstruction, is cutting into Marine Corps office<br />\nrecruiting campuses across the country.<br />\nThe corps commandant said some college<br />\nadministrators not only are failing to control student<br />\nprotestors, but also are refusing to provide Marine<br />\nrecruiters adequate time and central locations to sign<br />\nmen on campus.<br />\n\"These colleges have failed to control student<br />\naction and normal recruiting activity has been<br />\nthwarted,\" the officer wrote to written questions by the<br />\nAssociated Press. The Marines get 85% of their officer<br />\ncandidates each year from the annual crop of graduating<br />\ncollege seniors.<br /><br />\nDeferments Upheld<br />\nFederal Judge Edward Weinfeld, declaring that<br />\nthere are inequities under the Selective Service Act, has<br />\nheld that the exemption of ministers and theological<br />\nstudents and the deferment of college students are not<br />\nunconstitutional.<br />\nJudge Weinfeld said the power of Congress to<br />\ngrant exemptions and deferments was broad and its<br />\nauthority to classify and to conscript manpower for<br />\nmilitary service was beyond question. 'In exercising that<br />\nauthority,\" the Federal judge, \"Congress may, in the<br />\nnational interest, provide complete exemption from<br />\nservice for some and partial exemption for others. This<br />\ndetermination, insofar as it centers about the national<br />\nwelfare, is a matter of legislative grace.\"<br />\nIn attacking the system of draft deferments for<br />\ncollege students, two of the defendants, James H.<br />\nBranigan, Jr. and Sammie Lee Brown, contended that<br />\nthe present system _discriminates against the lower<br />\nincome groups because those generally belonging .to<br />\nthem could not afford to pay tuition and other<br />\nnecessary college expenses. As a result of their economic<br />\ndeprivations, most were ill equipped to meet the college<br />\nacademic standards.<br />\nJudge Weinfeld answered that \"There need be no<br />\nblinking at the fact that student deferments have<br />\nresulted in disparities.\"<br />\n\"however, to recognize that some inequalities<br />\nexist does not stamp it as unconstitutional...\"<br /><br />\nsot<br />\n!<br />\n---,pi 'Pic by<br /><br />\n110<br />\ngametime\u2022<br />\nCROWDS GATHER near Lacrosse field before<br /><br />\nassesse<br />\nA two dollar admission fee will be<br />\nat the Homecoming lacrosse game against Nav,<br />\nin order to defray from the cost of an additiorold<br />\n4800 seats being purchased for Homew\u00b0\u00b0<br />\nField.<br />\nEach full time undergraduate and graduate sturler\u201e<br /><br />\nwill be,entitled to one free ticket for the homeconlivn;<br />\ngame.
