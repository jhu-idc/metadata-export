It<br />\n<br />\nF, at the commencement of the season, there was any doubt as to the<br />\nsuccess of the Undergraduate Football Team, it has certainly been<br />\nIt It<br />\nIt<br />\nIt<br />\neffectually dispelled. The splendid showing which our men made<br />\n1St<br />\nat the Saint John's game, the defeat of the University of Maryland,<br />\nthe large crowds at Homewood on the 23rd and 28th, and the genF\u2022<br />\neral spirit and enthusiasm which have characterized these last few<br />\nweeks of the seas)n, are all certainly gratifying and convincing of<br />\nthe pronounced success of the new regime. Never before have we<br />\nturned out a team so full of grit and hard-working spirit as the one<br />\nthat lined up against Saint John's. Never before did enthusiasm<br />\nand \"Hopkins spirit\" reach so high a pitch as then. Never did the people of Baltimore<br />\nshow such interest as to stand for two hours on a muddy field, in a driving rain, in order to<br />\nsee Hopkins play football. A few may have done so before now\u2014but when the number<br />\nexceeds a thousand, as in this case, it becomes remarkable.<br />\nThe fact that the people were interested is owing to the real and hearty interest shown<br />\nand felt by the student-body. And the students were interested not only because it was a<br />\nHopkins team, but an Undergraduate team, made up of their personal friends\u2014not \"individual stars from all over the country\" (as someone has called our friends, the \"medics \").<br />\nAnd because they were personal friends the students were with them heart and soul.<br />\nThe Maryland game was less pleasing. Oil and water will not mix, and the ill feeling<br />\ndisplayed by the men from Lombard Street was in sharp contrast with the eager, yet friendly,<br />\nrivalry of our brass-buttoned friends from Annapolis. The students of the University of<br />\nMaryland don't lose much love over us, but what difference does that make, after all? We won<br />\nthe game, and won it fairly and squarely.<br />\nOur narrow defeat by Western Maryland, our scoreless tie with Saint John's, and our<br />\nvictory over the University of Maryland, all lead us to think and to hope that the Undergraduate team is something that will be with us always.<br />\n<br />\n\fTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\n<br />\n111.3V1W1<br />\nV<br />\n<br />\nV<br />\nkt it<br />\n<br />\nV<br />\nit<br />\n<br />\n11 WV<br />\n<br />\nt<br />\nV<br />\nV<br />\n\u2022 V<br />\nV<br />\n.

They could then play the Undergrates at Homewood on<br />\nWednesday afternoons. This would give them plenty of exercise,<br />\nand would improve the Undergraduate team without interferring<br />\nwith its regular practices.<br />\n<br />\nNE more word of comment on the football season. When the last<br />\nissue of the NEWS\u2014LETTER appeared the enthusiasm over the Saint<br />\nJohn's game\u2014to be played the next day\u2014was at its height. The<br />\nshort editorial on the poor rooting of the season was therefore<br />\nunnecessary. The showing made by the rooters at the last two<br />\ngames was as good as that of our team\u2014or nearly\u2014and the hearty<br />\nsupport they received must be gratifying to each and every member<br />\nof our team.<br />\n<br />\nWell, the first Hopkins Cotillon is over. It was a great success, of course. In fact<br />\nthings are generally a success here. Everything went off in fine style last Saturday night and<br />\nreflected credit on the Board of Governors of the Cotillon Club. There will be another dance<br />\nnext month\u2014on the thirty-first of January, we believe. We hope that all who were at<br />\nMcCoy Hall last Saturday will be back again then, and the unfortunate ones who were obliged<br />\nto be away will be able to come next time. We say \"obliged\" because surely no one would<br />\nbe silly enough to stay away if he could help it.<br />\n<br />\nWith the football season past, and track yet to come, it does seem as if more interest<br />\nshould be shown in the Glee Club. We do not speak of the Mandolin Club because it is getting<br />\nalong excellently. But the Glee Club is not. With so good a leader as Mr. Ruth, there is no<br />\nexcuse for so poor an attendance and such lack of enthusiasm and interest. Things have<br />\nbeen \"whooping up\" around here lately. Let's \"whoop up\" the Glee Club.<br />\n<br />\nThe grim approach of exams. next week prevented the publication of two issues of the<br />\n<br />\nNEws-LETTER before Christmas. An issue should have appeared last Friday and one today<br />\nweek, but even Editors are human and exams, have to be studied for! The NEWS\u2014LETTER<br />\nwishes you all success in the exams., a very Merry Christmas and a fine time during the<br />\nholidays.<br />\n<br />\nWhere's your Hopkins Night, '08?<br />\n<br />\n\fTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\n<br />\nTHE EARLY ENGLISH NOVELISTS.<br />\n<br />\nSmoLLETT.<br />\nIn Smollett we find a man who showed life<br />\nas it was, probably better than did either<br />\nRichardson or Fielding. He, being the inferior<br />\nwriter, did not improve his characters with<br />\nthe jovial good fellowship of Fielding, nor<br />\nwith the fanatical rigor of Richardson. And<br />\nthus, be it said to the shame of humanity, his<br />\ncharacters, being inferior in qualities, exceed<br />\nin truth, but only in one side of the truth.<br />\nSmollett was a more literal copyist of the side<br />\nof life\u2022he chose, but he chose only one side.<br />\nTo the good, the high, and the pure in life,<br />\nhe was blind. His characters are, without<br />\nexception, repulsive creatures, almost incapable of a worthy emotion. In his preface he<br />\ngives his idea of the novel. For him it is a<br />\nconvenient vehicle for satire; \"the most entertaining and universally improving.\" His<br />\ncharacters appear to us as ruffians, yet Smollett regarded himself as a moralist, he considered himself a writer calculated to improve,<br />\nyet he repulses us.<br />\nSmollet always put his enemies in his books.<br />\nHe was rancorous and implacable towards<br />\nthem. In Roderick Random he draws us a<br />\npicture of his grandfather, his cousins, an<br />\napothecary for whom he worked; all of whom<br />\nhe detested and with good reason.<br />\nHis first literary undertaking was a tragedy,<br />\nThe Regicide, in which he had always an<br />\noverweening pride. He considered it,(a drama<br />\nin blank verse, upon the murder of James I.,)<br />\na piece of great merit. But its results were<br />\nmost unhappy to him. For ten years he clung<br />\nto it, polished it, changed it, and finally in<br />\n1749, after the appearance of Roderick Random, he published it. Needless to say, it was<br />\na flat failure, \"unappreciated,\" he said. He<br />\nhad passed his medical examinations when he<br />\nfirst came to London. His money gave out<br />\nshortly afterwards and he obtained a berth as<br />\nsurgeon's mate on the Cumberland. Here he<br />\nobtained his material for Roderick Random.<br />\nHe soon left the navy and came back to London, where he practiced medicine with but<br />\nlittle success.<br />\nHe had failed as a dramatist, as a doctor<br />\nand as a satirist, and he turned his attention<br />\n<br />\nto the novel. Here he succeeded. The novel<br />\nwas then popular, and in 1748 he catered to<br />\nthe popular taste and produced Roderick<br />\nRandom.<br />\nRoderick Random is not a character that<br />\nwould appeal to our twentieth century minds.<br />\nSmollett, always an imitator of LeSage, here<br />\nfollows out the \"plan\" of Gil Bias, a plan as<br />\nold as Petronius Arbiter. It is merely a<br />\nhurly-burly, rough and tumble story of life on<br />\nthe road; but yet it contains a great deal of<br />\nSmollett's own life. The grandfather and<br />\nthe cousins of Random are no other than<br />\nthose of Smollett, with all their bad qualities<br />\nthrust into the foreground. The story of the<br />\nlife at sea is taken from Smollett's own life.<br />\nHe had been through all that he described<br />\nthere. Yes, Roderick Random, poor derelict<br />\nof fate, is no other than Smollett himself. He<br />\ndrags in his own unsuccessful Regicde under<br />\nthe disguise of Mr. Melopoyn's drama. He<br />\ntells of his own experiences with the managers.<br />\nHe attacks his former patron under the name<br />\nof Lord Strutwell, a man of large promises.<br />\nHere, too, he shows the influence of social<br />\nconditions upon him. Roderick Random is a<br />\ngentleman born; Strap is only a common<br />\nlackey: therefore Strap owes everything to<br />\nRandom. He must be his devoted slave. In<br />\nFrance he finds Random forsaken and penniless. He comes to his aid, gives him his<br />\nmoney and his clothes; in fact, becomes his<br />\nvalet. Of course, Random accepts. It is only<br />\nhis due. And then, after taking Strap's money,<br />\nhe may come home in a bad humor and vent<br />\nhis spite upon the poor boy. Random finally<br />\nfinishes by marrying Strap off to his wife's<br />\nmaid, whom he knows to be a low woman.<br />\nBut here Smollett rises to his highest as a<br />\nmoralist,\u2014the story of poor Miss Williams, a<br />\ntrue story, and one terrible in its very truth.<br />\nIt is not fiction. When Smollett penned those<br />\nfew pages, he was depicting one of the most<br />\nhorrible phases of humanity. It is not only<br />\nMiss Williams' story, but it is the story of<br />\nmany such another. There is no squeamishness or prudery here; it is a plain fact told in<br />\na plain way. We all see the depravity of<br />\nhuman nature in its most appalling form. It<br />\nis a sickening presentation of a fearful truth.<br />\nIn 1750, Peregrine Pickle was published.<br />\nSmollett introduces here people known to him<br />\n<br />\n\fTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\n<br />\nand draws them so well that they are easily<br />\nrecognized. Vet Peregrine Pickle is the best<br />\nthing he ever wrote. Of course the hero, like<br />\nall of Smollett's other heroes, is a hopeless<br />\nreprobate. Like Roderick Random, the novel<br />\nis made up of a string of adventures just<br />\nlinked together, and, as a matter of fact, there<br />\nis no reason that it should ever come to an<br />\nend, except that, in the course of time, the<br />\nhero, being mortal, must die. But judging from<br />\nthe modern Sherlock Holmes and Raffles, heroes<br />\nare perfectly able to come back to life and to<br />\nbe run through countless volumes. Smollett,<br />\nas a humorist, strikes twelve in Peregrine<br />\nPickle. Old Commodore Trunnion is one of<br />\nthe most laughable characters I know, but he<br />\nis entirely different from any other of Smollett's characters. I always thought that he<br />\ngot his idea for the commodore from Fielding's<br />\nSquire Western. However, in Peregrine Pickle<br />\nSmollett stamps himself as one of the foremost<br />\nhumorists in the language. There is nothing<br />\nsharp and quick in his wit; it is of a very<br />\nbroad order. If you can laugh at a comical<br />\nsituation, and be impervious to the vulgarity<br />\nof it, you can enjoy Peregrine Pickle.<br />\nThe weakest point in this novel is the longwinded account of the Lady of Quality. The<br />\nlady was the beautiful Lady Vane, whose<br />\namours were described in her memoirs, which<br />\nSmollett practically reproduced. It is unnecessary, and it was put in chiefly for the benefit<br />\nof the scandal mongers.<br />\nHis other novels are of much less importance<br />\nthan these two. Ferdenand Count Fathom,<br />\nThe Adventures of an Atom, Sir Launeelot<br />\nGraves, and Humphrey Clinker, complete the<br />\nlist. Of these, the first and the last are<br />\nworthy of mention.<br />\nFerdenand Count Fathom, is the adventures<br />\nof a young man, absolutely devoid of conscience, gratitude and courage, and incapable<br />\nof a genuine emotion. This admirable character betrays his master who had raised him,<br />\nlays traps for young girls, and does a variety of<br />\nother things on the same order. A more<br />\nsickening character has never been drawn in<br />\nthe whole of English literature. Finally,<br />\nthe hero reforms and marries a girl whom he<br />\nhad ruined before. Virtue came out supreme.<br />\nBut to say the least, it is not a moral or edifying tale.<br />\n<br />\n5<br />\n<br />\nHumphrey Clinker, is the last book Smollett<br />\never wrote, and in some respects the best of<br />\nthem all. Thackery said it was the most<br />\nlaughable book ever written. Certainly it is<br />\nthe kindest Sm011ett ever wrote. In it he<br />\nforgives everybody, even his own relations.<br />\nWhat could be more laughable than old<br />\nTabitha Brambles' persistent attempts at love.<br />\nThe book is a veritable history. Smollett<br />\nwrote of his own country, Scotland. All in<br />\nall, HumPhrey Clinker is the most \"good<br />\nnatured\" novel of Smollett's.<br />\nSmollett wrote of the low classes, and in<br />\nthis respect he was the forerunner of Dickens.<br />\nBut in turn, LeSage was the forerunner of<br />\nSmollett. It is only, however, in the class of<br />\ncharacters, that there is any resemblance to<br />\nDickens. Smollett wrote of the low classes<br />\nbecause he knew them. His favorite trick<br />\nwas to take for a hero a gentleman born, and<br />\nthen run him, surrounded by the lowest<br />\nsociety in England, through numberless chapters.<br />\nThe point in Smollett's novels most easily<br />\nassailed is the moral side. He claimed to be<br />\na moralist, but is he? The story of poor Miss<br />\nWilliams is undoubtedly written with the<br />\nmoral object in view. It is held up in all its<br />\nhorror. Vice is vice, and its consequences<br />\nare all put down. But with the exception of<br />\nthis, I do not think that there is anything in<br />\nSmollett calculated to have a good moral<br />\neffect. Of course we can consider Fathom as<br />\na sort of terrible example, but how many of<br />\nthe readers do? Is there anything calculated<br />\nto have a moral effect in Peregrine Pickle? We<br />\nfairly split our sides over some parts of it, but<br />\nit doesn't make us any better. Smollett, I<br />\nthink, uses the cloak of a moralist as a means<br />\nto introduce the low and the obscene. He has<br />\nneither the rigor of Richardson nor the open<br />\nbluffness of Fielding. He wants to be like<br />\nFielding, but he hasn't the courage to he so<br />\nopenly. No; Smollett is not moral. He is a<br />\ngreat humorist, but he is not a moralist.<br />\nWith Smollett passed away the old rough<br />\nand tumble novel of humor, of life on the<br />\nroad. It was for the best. They had diverted<br />\nthe stream of literature towards the realms of<br />\nfiction. Their successors were mightier than<br />\nthey were, but still we do not want to discard<br />\nthem completely. At the present day they<br />\n<br />\n\fTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\n<br />\n6<br />\n<br />\nare but little read, and perhaps that is for the<br />\nbest. There are two ways to be a moralist.<br />\nOne is to drag the reader down through the<br />\nfilth and mire of human depravity till, disgusted and nauseated, one turns in sheer desperation away. This is the course of the early<br />\nnovelists. The other is to so inspire the<br />\nreader, with the beauty of the true and the<br />\nhigh things in life that the love for them<br />\ncompletely crowds out the low and the vulgar.<br />\nHere, one turns to the higher things, not<br />\nthrough disgust and hatred for the low, but<br />\nfor the love of the better.<br />\nLet us appreciate Fielding, Richardson and<br />\nSmollett as best we can. They compose a<br />\nfield of literature comparatively unread. I do<br />\nnot seek to defend them, but I maintain that<br />\nthey, with all their coarseness and obscenity,<br />\nare far better than our modern fiction. Perhaps it is better to let them stay unread. They<br />\nwould not be appreciated by twentieth<br />\ncentury minds. Some would throw them<br />\naside, half read, disgusted and sick of them.<br />\nOthers would keep on in delight. To them it<br />\nwould be a fresh supply of 'gay reading.\" A<br />\nfew, a very few, would appreciate them.

The quietude of the desert<br />\nreigned on board. All the passengers were<br />\ncomfortably wrapped up in their steamerchairs, either enjoying a short after-dinner<br />\nnap, or dreaming with eyes wide open.<br />\nFrom the stern the soft, plaintive tunes of a<br />\nviolin were heard, played by one of the crew<br />\nperchance in honor of his distant sweetheart.<br />\nJack Hall was leaning over the railing, gazing down upon the silvery pathway caused by<br />\nthe moon on the gentle undulating waves.<br />\nHe could not help thinking of those dangerous green siren eyes, now closed in sleep<br />\nunder the protecting rug. They had not<br />\nfailed to bewitch him the first time he had<br />\nlooked into then when at the first dinner on<br />\nboard he had found her sitting next to him.<br />\nSince that moment he had been completely<br />\nunder their spell and had become Eunice<br />\nGrosset's most faithful and perhaps most<br />\nsuccessful suitor, cutting out all of his many<br />\nrivals.<br />\nHe enjoyed the privilege of having his<br />\nsteamer-chair next to hers, he was allowed to<br />\nwrap her up and arrange her numerous<br />\npillows and to carry out her many small<br />\norders. Sure, she was so sweet and fascinating and he felt as if they were friends of old<br />\nand he knew she felt the same way.<br />\nJack Hall had not stirred for the last thirty<br />\nminutes, gazing upon the play of the moon<br />\nrays on the water it seemed to him as if some<br />\nmermaids were dancing there, and strange to<br />\nsay, one of them was fixing her green phos-<br />\n<br />\n\fTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\n<br />\nphorescent eyes upon him\u2014why, she looked<br />\nlike Eunice, he thought. \"You're moonstruck, old chap,\" he murmured, \u2022'I'll have<br />\nto tell Eunice about my vision.\" He found<br />\nEunice sound asleep and so\u2014faute de mieux<br />\n\u2014followed her example and was soon slumbering away to the isle of dreams.<br />\nAll of a sudden, the liner stopped abruptly,<br />\nthrowing everyone on the floor. Shrieking,<br />\nrunning,\u2014yelling. \"Something wrong with<br />\nthe propellers,\" howled the Chief Engineer<br />\nafter a 'few moments of anxious expectation.<br />\nTwo men were ordered to investigate. After<br />\na short while they reappeared above the railing<br />\n\u2014a broad grill on their faces. They reported<br />\nthat the propellers were entangled in a mass<br />\nof sea-weed and that there were some mermaids down there, one of whom demanded<br />\nthe youngest man on board to come down<br />\nto her immediately, or else the whole ship<br />\nwould be wrecked.<br />\nJack was looking around in order to find to<br />\nfind tile poor chap who would have to sacrifice himself for the benefit of his fellowpassengers, when the Captain tipped him on<br />\nhis shoulder. \"Mr. Hall,\" he said, \"the<br />\nChief Steward after looking over the passenger<br />\nlist, informs me, that you are the youngest<br />\nman, and so, I'm afraid, you're the man<br />\nwanted down there.\"<br />\n\"What I, am I the youngest?\" yelled Jack.<br />\n'Yes, I'm sorry.'<br />\n\"So am I. I'm not going down there.\"<br />\n\"Well we'll see about that\" said the Captain cruelly, and before Jack knew what happened he felt himself lifted up by brutal hands<br />\nand thrown overboard. It seemed to him as<br />\nif he were flying thru the air for more than<br />\nan hour, before he finally safely landed in an<br />\nimmense shell at the side of the beautiful mermaid who had stared at him, while he was<br />\nwatching her dancing.<br />\n\"Take this stone, sweet mortal, it will protect you from the waters,\" she said to our<br />\nspeechless Jack, *handing him a- big emerald.<br />\nShe then blew a silver-whistle and instantly<br />\nthe shell began to sink slowly until it finally<br />\nlanded before a large grot. The mermaid<br />\ntook Jack by the hand and led him thru the<br />\nlabyrinth of passage until she finally dragged<br />\nhim into a beautifully furnished room. Throwing herself on a lounge, she drew Jack to her.<br />\n<br />\n7<br />\n<br />\nClasping her beautiful white, but ice-cold arms<br />\naround his neck, she whispered: \"I love you<br />\nso much, angel-pie!\"<br />\n\"This is so very sudden, indeed, I just met<br />\nyou Miss,\" stammered Jack\u2014\"you see, I<br />\ndon't even know your name.\" \"Name\u2014you<br />\nare so funny, beloved mortal, what is this, a<br />\nname?\"<br />\n\"Yes, you're right, what's in a name? but<br />\nyou see, I would like to know now how your<br />\npeople call you.\"<br />\n\"They call me Queen!\" she answered<br />\nproudly.<br />\n\"All right then Miss Queen, as I was<br />\ngoing\u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \"<br />\n\"Oh, precious, don't waste time talking,\"<br />\nshe interrupted him impatiently, \"kiss me,<br />\nkiss me, my liberator, and tell me, that you<br />\nlove me, as I love you, you spell-breaker!\"<br />\n\"Spell\u2014<br />\n\"Yes, don't you know that my father, who<br />\nwanted me to marry one of those ugly Tritons<br />\ndown here, although he knew that I was crazy<br />\nabout a navy-lieutenant,\u2014I don't think of<br />\nhim any more, now that I have you, my idol\u2014<br />\nwell, you see, at that time I refused to marry<br />\nthat Triton and consequently my father\u2014you<br />\nknow him, he'll do a thing like that, when<br />\nhe's mad, so he wove a spell over me, that I<br />\nshould never feel love's joys and sorrows again<br />\nunless a mortal could stand the gaze of my eyes<br />\nfor five minutes.

You have broken<br />\nthe spell. I know what love is, I can love<br />\nagain, love again!!!\" she shouted, frantic with<br />\njoy, covering his mouth, his eyes, his whole<br />\nface with glowing kisses. Jack, who so far<br />\nhad felt rather uneasy, did not object to this<br />\nkind of treatment\u2014nor, why should he, would<br />\nyou?\u2014but, brought up to be polite, he returned her caresses with the same ardour\u2014 \u2014<br />\nAt last, when both really had to gasp for<br />\nbreath, Jack jumped up and pulling out his<br />\nwatch cried: \"Oh, Great Scott, is it as late as<br />\nthat; past eleven! ! I'm distressed, that I<br />\noverstayed the time. Eleven is your limit, I<br />\nsuppose.

He had<br />\nbeen receding slowly towards the door and<br />\nwith a desperate leap tried to get out, but she<br />\nheld him by his sleeve.<br />\n\"Leave me,\" he cried, now getting really<br />\nmad, \"this farce has been going on too long<br />\nany way.\"<br />\n\"You are very polite indeed\" she answered<br />\nin a somewhat changed voice, as Jack thought.<br />\n\"The idea of your proposing to me\u2014!\"<br />\n\"But, Mr.\u2014\"<br />\n\"Aw, let me continue, I'm tired of this.

He had<br />\n<br />\nstared at the beautiful creature, whom her<br />\nfury made all the more attractive, as if she<br />\nwere a supernatural phantom. Her weeping<br />\nbrought him back to earth; he simply could<br />\nnot stand seeing a girl in tears, so timidly<br />\nlaying his hand on her arm, he said with all<br />\nthe gentleness and tenderness he was capable<br />\nof in a rueful tone: \"But, dear Miss<br />\nEunice\u2014 \u2014\"<br />\nBut Eunice jumped up and ,with flashing<br />\neyes, phosphorescent in the half-dark, she<br />\ncried: \"How dare you touch my arm, how<br />\ndare you call me by my first name!

JOHN'S, 0\u2014HOPKINS, 0.<br />\nBy the time this article appears the great<br />\ngame with St. John's, in common with all<br />\ngreat games, will have become but a memory,<br />\nthe echoes of the cheering that followed<br />\nMusser's wonderful one-hand back tackle will<br />\nbe almost dead \"in yon rich sky,\" the yells<br />\nthat greeted Bridgman as he emerged, clad in<br />\nhalf a jersey and a lot of mud, after his twelveyard line plunge, will have likewise faded into<br />\nthe rapidily receding past. And yet it is but<br />\nfittiiig that some attempt, at least, be made to<br />\ncause the memory of this game of games to<br />\nlinger a while in the hearts of all true Hopkins<br />\nmen,for it was the enthusiasm that the struggle evoked that proved that love for his<br />\nUniversity is the great passion of the Hopkins<br />\nman, that he would brave rain, snow and<br />\nthe various other kinds of weather, the<br />\nnecessity of standing throughout an entire<br />\ngame, the danger from Dr. Wood's boomerangs, and, above all, the expectation of almost<br />\ncertain defeat, in order to come out and root<br />\nfor his team.<br />\nIt would be useless to speak here of the<br />\nmeetings and yell practices that preceeded the<br />\ngame, to tell bow \"Purd'n's\" voice sounded<br />\nlike a fog-horn in the distance, with a spring<br />\nloose. Everybody remembers it all, and everybody remembers, too, the consequent magnificent showing the horde of the faithful made,<br />\nas, armed with its red, white and blue megaphones, it rooted for the pluckiest team the<br />\nUniversity ever put out.<br />\nThere is no need to speak here of the game<br />\nitself. The whole student-body was out there<br />\nand saw the confidence with which the St.<br />\nJohn's followers gave odds on the result, and<br />\nthe surprise with which they viewed the gains<br />\n-made by the Hopkins back field. They were<br />\nsurprised at the work of Abel, Bridgman,<br />\nStollenwerck and Chesney, but they groaned<br />\nin very truth when their own much-vaunted<br />\nCaptain Quimby, Bosley and Warfield failed<br />\nto pierce the adamant opposing line. Nor<br />\nwere their end runs any more successful.<br />\nThey played a great game, but the advantage<br />\nall the way was with the Black and Blue. The<br />\nodds were against Hopkins, but, backed by its<br />\nmadly enthusiastic rooters and its brass band,<br />\nit put the glory of St. John's to the blush.<br />\nTo be sure, the score does not give this<br />\n<br />\n9<br />\n<br />\nUniversity a victory, but in reality the game<br />\nwas more than a victory. It was a grand<br />\ntriumph for Hopkins spirit.<br />\nThe line-up:<br />\nMusser '<br />\nLeft End<br />\nC. Tilghman<br />\nLeft Tackle<br />\nR. Tilghman<br />\nLeft Guard<br />\nMaddren,<br />\nCentre<br />\nBlanck<br />\nRight Guard<br />\nStockton<br />\nRight Tackle<br />\nRidgely<br />\nRight End<br />\nStollenwerk<br />\nQuarter-back<br />\nChesney<br />\nLeft Halfback<br />\nAbel, McCabe<br />\nRight Halfback<br />\nBridgman<br />\nFullback<br />\n<br />\nHOPKINS, 7\u2014UNIVERSITY OF MARYLAND, 0.<br />\nOur eleven placed a fitting end to a season<br />\nthat started anything but successfully by defeating the University of Maryland 7 to 0 in the<br />\nannual Thanksgiving game. An old saying<br />\nhas it that \"victory comes to him that waits,\"<br />\nand that fits our case exactly. We have been<br />\nwaiting the entire season for a victory and at<br />\nlast our team has earned one. The credit of<br />\nthis victory is due to the magnificent work of<br />\nthe Black and Blue line. Every man showed<br />\nthe \"do or die\" spirit and played with every<br />\nounce of strength and spirit that he could<br />\nsummon. Blank and Stockton were impregnable on the right wing and Morse and<br />\nTilghman gave way but little before the continuous, hammering plunges of the Maroon<br />\nand Black backs. In fact our fellows held for<br />\ndowns no less than five times.<br />\nThe game was throughout a succession of<br />\ngruelling line plunges and punts. Open plays<br />\nwere seldom used and when they were tried<br />\nthey were unsuccessful. In offensive work<br />\nour fellows showed a decided reversal of form<br />\nfrom the St. John's game. Somehow or<br />\nother the plays would not work right. This<br />\nwas probably due to the absence of Abel and<br />\nto the fact that Blake, the University captain,<br />\ncovered Chesney closely during the entire<br />\ngame and did not give him a chance to break<br />\nloose. Hopkins kicked to University of Maryland, who started immediately to march down<br />\nthe field toward our goal. Our fellows held,<br />\nthough, in about mid-field and started to do a<br />\n<br />\n\f10<br />\n<br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\n<br />\nlittle line plunging of their own, but the ball<br />\nwas soon lost on a faulty forward pass. After<br />\nthe pigskin had exchanged hands, Hopkins<br />\nadvanced the ball as far as the 30 yard line,<br />\nwhere Stollenwerk tried for a field goal but<br />\nmissed. After this the Marylanders steadily<br />\ngained ground and the half ended with the<br />\nball in their possession on the 30 yard line.<br />\nToward the end of the half Stollenwerk<br />\nsprained his shoulder and was replaced in the<br />\nsecond half by Chesney.<br />\nOur fellows started the second half strong.<br />\nStewart received the kick-off and ran the ball<br />\nback ten yards before being tackled. Then a<br />\ndouble pass to McCabe netted ten more yards.<br />\nAt this point our fellows were penallized for<br />\nan off-side play, and Chesney was forced to<br />\npunt. The ball was kicked perfectly and<br />\nsailed hard and low just over the quarterback's head and landed behind the University of Maryland's goal line. Wendell picked<br />\nup the ball and started to run with it but was<br />\ntackle behind the goal line by Morse, and the<br />\nscore stood 2 to 0 in our favor. After this<br />\ncame the hardest playing of the game.<br />\nUniversity of Maryland sent its backs time<br />\nafter time against our tackles, but our line<br />\nfought gamely and held their opponents for<br />\ndowns three times within 20 yards of our<br />\ngoal. It was only in the last five minutes of<br />\nplay that the Black and Blue attack showed<br />\nits characteristic speed. Ridgely secured the<br />\nball from a fumble on the Marylanders' 30<br />\nyard line. Two plunges failed and then our<br />\nteam worked the neatest trick of the game.<br />\nThe tackles were shifted over as if the play<br />\nwas to be toward the center of the field, and<br />\nit was on this that the Maroon and Black<br />\nbacks \"bit,\" for Chesney fell back, made a<br />\nforward pass to Ridgely, who ran unmolested<br />\nto the two and a half yard line before being<br />\ntackled. Thcn after two downs, Stewart<br />\nplowed through left tackle for the touchdown. With two minutes more to play, the<br />\nUniversity of Maryland team left the field in<br />\ndisgust, with the referee, as they put it, but<br />\nin reality with themselves.<br />\nThe game was the most successful of the<br />\nseason from a pecuniary as well as an athletic<br />\nstandpoint, for there were almost 3000 paid<br />\nadmissions. Our rooters were also out in<br />\nforce and cheered with a right good will.<br />\n<br />\nThe only disagreeable feature was the evident<br />\nill-feeling of the University of Maryland<br />\nrooters toward Hopkins. The hissing of our<br />\nteam as it came out on the field and the unnecessary rough tactics of the University of<br />\nMaryland team will hardly add to the feeling<br />\nof friendly rivalry that has heretofore existed<br />\nbetween the two universities.<br />\n<br />\nJUNIORS, 6-FRESHMEN, 0.<br />\nThose who journeyed to Mt. Washington<br />\non Friday, December 6, were well repaid for<br />\nany uncomfortableness which they may have<br />\nfelt in the lower portions of their anatomy.<br />\nThere was a fine crowd, quite as many as<br />\nattended the St. John's game, and there was<br />\nmore than one fair face to spur on the warring<br />\ngladiators. Those same gladiators needed no<br />\nspurring, however! Rarely has there been<br />\nsuch intense rivalry between two classes.<br />\nIn the first place the Freshmen had a larger<br />\nnumber of good individual players, than had<br />\nthe Juniors. Then the Juniors lost Michael,<br />\nand this fact tended to' give the younger fellows more confidence. Realizing this, the<br />\nJuniors set to work with a determination that<br />\nwas laudable, and in the end, won a victory<br />\nwhich was well deserved. Much credit is due<br />\nCaptain Baily for the way in which he gathered his material together and developed a<br />\nwell-drilled, plucky eleven.<br />\nThe Freshmen were slower to organize, and<br />\ndid not acquire team work to the degree that<br />\nthe 1909 team did. Nevertheless, they put<br />\nup a plucky fight, and, in the first half, by<br />\nthe use of two neat fortvard passes, put the<br />\nball within ten yards of the posts, but could<br />\nnot score. As a matter of fact, they played<br />\nbetter than was expected by them, but they<br />\nweakened visibly in the second half, when<br />\nthey rarely made first down. Had it not<br />\nbeen for fumbling in the Junior line, the<br />\nFreshmen would not have loomed so dangerous as they did at times. As is usual in class<br />\ngames, neither team could gain consistently<br />\nfor any length of time.<br />\nThe playing of Baily, the Junior captain, is<br />\nespecially worthy of commendation. His<br />\nwork was the bright part of.the game. Twice<br />\nhe crossed the Freshman goal line, after most<br />\nbrilliant runs, but one of the touchdowns was<br />\n<br />\n\fTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\n<br />\n11<br />\n<br />\nnot allowed because of offside play.

His<br />\npoems seems an echo of the words in<br />\nAtalanta.\"<br />\n<br />\n\"For if you don't I really might<br />\nSnatch just one kiss here in the light\u2014<br />\nBut there 'tis dark; the fire burns low,<br />\nAnd we need fear nor friend nor foe\u2014<br />\n\"His life is a watch or a vision<br />\nWe'll not be found, tis hidden quite\u2014<br />\nBetween a sleep and a sleep,\"<br />\nMy Christmas Girl!\" or even of the more awful words of Webster<br />\nTRioLET.<br />\n<br />\n\"Their life a general mist of error<br />\nTheir death a hideous storm of terror.\"<br />\n<br />\nShe stood 'neath the holly<br />\nAnd not mistletoe.<br />\nLittle Miss Dolly,<br />\nShe stood 'neath the holly,<br />\nBut 1 felt so jolly<br />\nAnd the light was so low\u2014<br />\n* * * * * *<br />\n<br />\nThe romantic glamour of the \"days that<br />\nare no more\" has had a strong influence over<br />\nmuch of Mr. Phillips's work. In his earliest<br />\nplay Francesca says\u2014<br />\n<br />\nShe stood 'neath the holly<br />\nAnd not mistletoe!<br />\n<br />\nand by the side of Marpessa, Idas is<br />\n<br />\nIV.\u2014A RONDEI,.<br />\nOn Christmas night when all our games are<br />\ndone<br />\nThe children kissed and put to bed each one<br />\nWhen the long laughter of the happy day<br />\nIs gradually subdued and dies away,<br />\nWith tired eyes we watch the fire-light<br />\nOn Christmas night!<br />\n<br />\n\"Nothing bath grieved me yet but ancient woes,<br />\nSea perils, or some long-ago farewell,<br />\nOr the last sunset cry of woundei Kings\"<br />\n\"Aware of other climes and lands<br />\nOf birth far-back, of lives in many stars.\"<br />\n<br />\nIn like strain Endymion (in the poem of<br />\nthat name in the new volume)speaks to Selene<br />\n\"I begin<br />\nTo grieve for ancient wars and at the thought<br />\nOf women that have died long, long ago,<br />\nFor sea-tossed heroes labouring towards the West.\"<br />\n<br />\nNow-a-days when all the younger writers of<br />\nverse are exhibiting their command of intricate meters, there is something refreshing<br />\n<br />\n\f14<br />\n<br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\n<br />\nin the limited range of Mr. Phillips' poetic<br />\ngift. Save in the heroic complet\u2014in which<br />\nform of verse he has been compared to no less<br />\na poet than \"glorious John\"\u2014he has little<br />\npower over rhyme. But in his blank-verse<br />\nthe mantel of Tennyson seems to have fallen<br />\nupon him. There is no sign of imitiation but<br />\nof lineal descent from the master. In the<br />\nlines on Gladstone for instance, we note<br />\n\"Thy voice had all the roaring of the wave,<br />\nAnd hoarse magnificence of rushing stones,<br />\nIt had the murmur of Ionian bees\u2014\"<br />\n<br />\na line which at once recalls<br />\n\"The moan of doves in innnemorial chins,<br />\nAnd murmuring of innumerable bees.\"<br />\n<br />\nOf the poems in the new volume the \"Quest<br />\nof Edith\"\u2014(for the body of Harold after<br />\nSentac) is very dramatic and here again we<br />\nhave the Tennysonian echo\u2014this time from<br />\n\"Harold.\" In the grim poem \"Cities of<br />\nHell\" the poet presents the thought that<br />\nwhat we do in this world we must re-enact in<br />\nthe next\u2014<br />\n\"Nothing done, or said, or thought,<br />\nShall ever perish; none can ever die.\"<br />\n<br />\nIn the \"Parting of Launcelot and Guinivere\" we have a suggestion of what perhaps<br />\ntook place sometime after Arthur left his<br />\nQueen and before she passed \"to where beyoud these voices there is peace.\"<br />\nThe volume closes with \"lole,\" a tragedy<br />\nin one act. The old Biblical story of Jeptha's<br />\nDaughter is transferred to a classical setting<br />\nand around it Mr. Phillips has built up an<br />\nexquisitely artistic little play\u2014full of genuine<br />\npathos and real beauty.<br />\nThere are many other poems which we cannot mention now. Altogether the volume is<br />\ndistinctly pleasing. \"Nero,\" Mr. Phillips'<br />\nlast play, was a disappointment, and we are<br />\ntherefore the more glad to see that he is as<br />\ncapable as ever of sound workmanship, producing poetry of an high and lasting character.<br />\n<br />\nTHE DANCE.<br />\nThe first of the Johns Hopkins Cotillon<br />\nDances, was held on the night of December<br />\nthe 7th, and proved to be a success. The<br />\nhall was tastefully decorated, the different<br />\ncolors of the class banners showing up wonderfully well in the electric ligkt. The flag<br />\nof the Juniors, however, was somewhat conspicuous by its absence.<br />\n<br />\nThe dances began rather later than usual,<br />\nbut by half-past nine o'clock, McCoy Hall<br />\nwas well filled. A number of the Alumni<br />\narrived during the evening and did their full<br />\nshare towards making the dance a success.<br />\nThe music, consisting of five pieces, was<br />\nexcellent and the selections were very well<br />\nchosen. Supper was served about half-past<br />\nten o'clock and enjoyed by everyone. After<br />\nsupper there were eight dances, making a<br />\ntotal of sixteen. There were also a number<br />\nof \"extras\" and the dance was not over until<br />\nthe clock struck twelve.<br />\nThe only matter of regret is the failure to<br />\nappear on the part of many of the Patronesses.<br />\nAs these dances are held under the auspices<br />\nof the fraternities, and are an attractive part<br />\nof the social life of the University, the presence of all of the Patronesses would be highly<br />\nappreciated.<br />\nThe NEWS-LETTER takes this opportunity<br />\nto congratulate the Dance Committee on its<br />\nsuccess and looks forward to other successful<br />\ncotillons under its direction.<br />\n<br />\nA SELECTION FROM THE \"FOLLIES<br />\nOF 1911.\"<br />\nWITH NO APOLOGIES TO CHAUCER<br />\nA Freshman there was, war and wys also<br />\nThat unto Hopkins hadde just y-go,<br />\nIn all this world ne was there noon him lyk<br />\nTo mightie Junior scornfully to spyk;<br />\nHis hosen weren of fyn scarlet reed<br />\nAnd brown derbie kepte he upon his heed;<br />\nOf tyes and robes hadde he many oon<br />\nSo great a dandy swell was nowher noon.<br />\nBut now the Junior dorste make avaunt<br />\nHe wiste a man that wolde be repentaunt:<br />\nThis Junior was a verray parfit hazier<br />\nA lovyer, and a lusty Bacheler.\u2014<br />\nThough not of Artes hadde IL! his degree;<br />\nAt many a noble rushe hadde he be.<br />\nOf Budweise many a glass had he y-drawe<br />\nAnd, certainly, he was a good felowe.<br />\nAnd so bifel, by aventure or charge,<br />\nThis freshman roped was into the Hopkins<br />\ncage.<br />\n!!!<br />\n! !!<br />\n!! !<br />\nAnon, to drawen the curtain from the scene,<br />\nThe Freshmaii cometh forth not quite so clene<br />\nBut just as one encombred in the myre<br />\nWith tamed expressioun and closed eye.<br />\nIn all the classes four noon is that can<br />\n\u2014As does this freshie, this obsequious man<br />\nSince his descent into the Hopkins cage\u2014<br />\nSo much of reverence and fair langage.<br />\nAnd, now then Freshmen: tak this as a signe<br />\nOf the mighte and sway of NINETEENNINE.<br />\n<br />\n\fTHE MEWS-LETTER.<br />\n<br />\n15<br />\n<br />\nILGENFRITZ STUDIO<br />\n<br />\n\"AB\" SAYLER.<br />\nHave a shake all around, \"Ab\" Sayler,<br />\nYour team has made a rep; it's a nailer.<br />\nSo stop your bloomin' fussin,<br />\n'Taint no need for further cussin,<br />\nYour swearin' should be rustin', \"Ab\" Sayler.<br />\n<br />\nSuccessor to CUMM INS<br />\n<br />\nARTISTIC PHOTOGRAPHY<br />\n20 West Lexington Street<br />\n<br />\nBALTIMORE<br />\n<br />\nSpecial Discount to Students<br />\n<br />\n\"The Men's Store.\"<br />\nThough the scores have not been high, \"Ab\"<br />\nSayler,<br />\nYo'u had a proposition and a whaler,<br />\nWith monster shoulder-pads<br />\nOn those little Underkrads,<br />\nYou showed the bunch the fads, \"Ab\" Sayler.<br />\nThe spirit you instilled, \"Ab\" Sayler,<br />\nWhile not quite al-co-holic was no frailer,<br />\nFor the plucky little crew,<br />\nWith the tricks they got from you,<br />\nTold St. John's a thing or two, \"Ab\" Sayler.<br />\nThe season ending now, \"Ab\" Sayler,<br />\nMakes us think the scores next season will be<br />\nhaler;<br />\nWith an Undergraduate crowd,<br />\nSame as this we'll do things proud,<br />\nIf you come and cuss 'em loud,\"Ab\" Sayler.<br />\nSo shake hands once again, \"Ab\" Sayler,<br />\nYou've a team to make you proud; it's a<br />\nnailer,<br />\nAnd there ain't no grounds for bootin',<br />\nFor the side-lines now are whoopin',<br />\nAnd for you they'll keep a-rootin', \"Ab\"<br />\nSayler.<br />\nR.<br />\n<br />\nHUTZLER 131131HElt)<br />\n210 to 218 NORTH HOWARD ST.<br />\n<br />\nCARL C.

It<br /><br />\nF, at the commencement of the season, there was any doubt as to the<br />\nsuccess of the Undergraduate Football Team, it has certainly been<br />\nIt It<br />\nIt<br />\nIt<br />\neffectually dispelled. The splendid showing which our men made<br />\n1St<br />\nat the Saint John's game, the defeat of the University of Maryland,<br />\nthe large crowds at Homewood on the 23rd and 28th, and the genF\u2022<br />\neral spirit and enthusiasm which have characterized these last few<br />\nweeks of the seas)n, are all certainly gratifying and convincing of<br />\nthe pronounced success of the new regime. Never before have we<br />\nturned out a team so full of grit and hard-working spirit as the one<br />\nthat lined up against Saint John's. Never before did enthusiasm<br />\nand \"Hopkins spirit\" reach so high a pitch as then. Never did the people of Baltimore<br />\nshow such interest as to stand for two hours on a muddy field, in a driving rain, in order to<br />\nsee Hopkins play football. A few may have done so before now\u2014but when the number<br />\nexceeds a thousand, as in this case, it becomes remarkable.<br />\nThe fact that the people were interested is owing to the real and hearty interest shown<br />\nand felt by the student-body. And the students were interested not only because it was a<br />\nHopkins team, but an Undergraduate team, made up of their personal friends\u2014not \"individual stars from all over the country\" (as someone has called our friends, the \"medics \").<br />\nAnd because they were personal friends the students were with them heart and soul.<br />\nThe Maryland game was less pleasing. Oil and water will not mix, and the ill feeling<br />\ndisplayed by the men from Lombard Street was in sharp contrast with the eager, yet friendly,<br />\nrivalry of our brass-buttoned friends from Annapolis. The students of the University of<br />\nMaryland don't lose much love over us, but what difference does that make, after all? We won<br />\nthe game, and won it fairly and squarely.<br />\nOur narrow defeat by Western Maryland, our scoreless tie with Saint John's, and our<br />\nvictory over the University of Maryland, all lead us to think and to hope that the Undergraduate team is something that will be with us always.<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br /><br />\n111.3V1W1<br />\nV<br /><br />\nV<br />\nkt it<br /><br />\nV<br />\nit<br /><br />\n11 WV<br /><br />\nt<br />\nV<br />\nV<br />\n\u2022 V<br />\nV<br />\n.

They could then play the Undergrates at Homewood on<br />\nWednesday afternoons. This would give them plenty of exercise,<br />\nand would improve the Undergraduate team without interferring<br />\nwith its regular practices.<br /><br />\nNE more word of comment on the football season. When the last<br />\nissue of the NEWS\u2014LETTER appeared the enthusiasm over the Saint<br />\nJohn's game\u2014to be played the next day\u2014was at its height. The<br />\nshort editorial on the poor rooting of the season was therefore<br />\nunnecessary. The showing made by the rooters at the last two<br />\ngames was as good as that of our team\u2014or nearly\u2014and the hearty<br />\nsupport they received must be gratifying to each and every member<br />\nof our team.<br /><br />\nWell, the first Hopkins Cotillon is over. It was a great success, of course. In fact<br />\nthings are generally a success here. Everything went off in fine style last Saturday night and<br />\nreflected credit on the Board of Governors of the Cotillon Club. There will be another dance<br />\nnext month\u2014on the thirty-first of January, we believe. We hope that all who were at<br />\nMcCoy Hall last Saturday will be back again then, and the unfortunate ones who were obliged<br />\nto be away will be able to come next time. We say \"obliged\" because surely no one would<br />\nbe silly enough to stay away if he could help it.<br /><br />\nWith the football season past, and track yet to come, it does seem as if more interest<br />\nshould be shown in the Glee Club. We do not speak of the Mandolin Club because it is getting<br />\nalong excellently. But the Glee Club is not. With so good a leader as Mr. Ruth, there is no<br />\nexcuse for so poor an attendance and such lack of enthusiasm and interest. Things have<br />\nbeen \"whooping up\" around here lately. Let's \"whoop up\" the Glee Club.<br /><br />\nThe grim approach of exams. next week prevented the publication of two issues of the<br /><br />\nNEws-LETTER before Christmas. An issue should have appeared last Friday and one today<br />\nweek, but even Editors are human and exams, have to be studied for! The NEWS\u2014LETTER<br />\nwishes you all success in the exams., a very Merry Christmas and a fine time during the<br />\nholidays.<br /><br />\nWhere's your Hopkins Night, '08?<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br /><br />\nTHE EARLY ENGLISH NOVELISTS.<br /><br />\nSmoLLETT.<br />\nIn Smollett we find a man who showed life<br />\nas it was, probably better than did either<br />\nRichardson or Fielding. He, being the inferior<br />\nwriter, did not improve his characters with<br />\nthe jovial good fellowship of Fielding, nor<br />\nwith the fanatical rigor of Richardson. And<br />\nthus, be it said to the shame of humanity, his<br />\ncharacters, being inferior in qualities, exceed<br />\nin truth, but only in one side of the truth.<br />\nSmollett was a more literal copyist of the side<br />\nof life\u2022he chose, but he chose only one side.<br />\nTo the good, the high, and the pure in life,<br />\nhe was blind. His characters are, without<br />\nexception, repulsive creatures, almost incapable of a worthy emotion. In his preface he<br />\ngives his idea of the novel. For him it is a<br />\nconvenient vehicle for satire; \"the most entertaining and universally improving.\" His<br />\ncharacters appear to us as ruffians, yet Smollett regarded himself as a moralist, he considered himself a writer calculated to improve,<br />\nyet he repulses us.<br />\nSmollet always put his enemies in his books.<br />\nHe was rancorous and implacable towards<br />\nthem. In Roderick Random he draws us a<br />\npicture of his grandfather, his cousins, an<br />\napothecary for whom he worked; all of whom<br />\nhe detested and with good reason.<br />\nHis first literary undertaking was a tragedy,<br />\nThe Regicide, in which he had always an<br />\noverweening pride. He considered it,(a drama<br />\nin blank verse, upon the murder of James I.,)<br />\na piece of great merit. But its results were<br />\nmost unhappy to him. For ten years he clung<br />\nto it, polished it, changed it, and finally in<br />\n1749, after the appearance of Roderick Random, he published it. Needless to say, it was<br />\na flat failure, \"unappreciated,\" he said. He<br />\nhad passed his medical examinations when he<br />\nfirst came to London. His money gave out<br />\nshortly afterwards and he obtained a berth as<br />\nsurgeon's mate on the Cumberland. Here he<br />\nobtained his material for Roderick Random.<br />\nHe soon left the navy and came back to London, where he practiced medicine with but<br />\nlittle success.<br />\nHe had failed as a dramatist, as a doctor<br />\nand as a satirist, and he turned his attention<br /><br />\nto the novel. Here he succeeded. The novel<br />\nwas then popular, and in 1748 he catered to<br />\nthe popular taste and produced Roderick<br />\nRandom.<br />\nRoderick Random is not a character that<br />\nwould appeal to our twentieth century minds.<br />\nSmollett, always an imitator of LeSage, here<br />\nfollows out the \"plan\" of Gil Bias, a plan as<br />\nold as Petronius Arbiter. It is merely a<br />\nhurly-burly, rough and tumble story of life on<br />\nthe road; but yet it contains a great deal of<br />\nSmollett's own life. The grandfather and<br />\nthe cousins of Random are no other than<br />\nthose of Smollett, with all their bad qualities<br />\nthrust into the foreground. The story of the<br />\nlife at sea is taken from Smollett's own life.<br />\nHe had been through all that he described<br />\nthere. Yes, Roderick Random, poor derelict<br />\nof fate, is no other than Smollett himself. He<br />\ndrags in his own unsuccessful Regicde under<br />\nthe disguise of Mr. Melopoyn's drama. He<br />\ntells of his own experiences with the managers.<br />\nHe attacks his former patron under the name<br />\nof Lord Strutwell, a man of large promises.<br />\nHere, too, he shows the influence of social<br />\nconditions upon him. Roderick Random is a<br />\ngentleman born; Strap is only a common<br />\nlackey: therefore Strap owes everything to<br />\nRandom. He must be his devoted slave. In<br />\nFrance he finds Random forsaken and penniless. He comes to his aid, gives him his<br />\nmoney and his clothes; in fact, becomes his<br />\nvalet. Of course, Random accepts. It is only<br />\nhis due. And then, after taking Strap's money,<br />\nhe may come home in a bad humor and vent<br />\nhis spite upon the poor boy. Random finally<br />\nfinishes by marrying Strap off to his wife's<br />\nmaid, whom he knows to be a low woman.<br />\nBut here Smollett rises to his highest as a<br />\nmoralist,\u2014the story of poor Miss Williams, a<br />\ntrue story, and one terrible in its very truth.<br />\nIt is not fiction. When Smollett penned those<br />\nfew pages, he was depicting one of the most<br />\nhorrible phases of humanity. It is not only<br />\nMiss Williams' story, but it is the story of<br />\nmany such another. There is no squeamishness or prudery here; it is a plain fact told in<br />\na plain way. We all see the depravity of<br />\nhuman nature in its most appalling form. It<br />\nis a sickening presentation of a fearful truth.<br />\nIn 1750, Peregrine Pickle was published.<br />\nSmollett introduces here people known to him<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br /><br />\nand draws them so well that they are easily<br />\nrecognized. Vet Peregrine Pickle is the best<br />\nthing he ever wrote. Of course the hero, like<br />\nall of Smollett's other heroes, is a hopeless<br />\nreprobate. Like Roderick Random, the novel<br />\nis made up of a string of adventures just<br />\nlinked together, and, as a matter of fact, there<br />\nis no reason that it should ever come to an<br />\nend, except that, in the course of time, the<br />\nhero, being mortal, must die. But judging from<br />\nthe modern Sherlock Holmes and Raffles, heroes<br />\nare perfectly able to come back to life and to<br />\nbe run through countless volumes. Smollett,<br />\nas a humorist, strikes twelve in Peregrine<br />\nPickle. Old Commodore Trunnion is one of<br />\nthe most laughable characters I know, but he<br />\nis entirely different from any other of Smollett's characters. I always thought that he<br />\ngot his idea for the commodore from Fielding's<br />\nSquire Western. However, in Peregrine Pickle<br />\nSmollett stamps himself as one of the foremost<br />\nhumorists in the language. There is nothing<br />\nsharp and quick in his wit; it is of a very<br />\nbroad order. If you can laugh at a comical<br />\nsituation, and be impervious to the vulgarity<br />\nof it, you can enjoy Peregrine Pickle.<br />\nThe weakest point in this novel is the longwinded account of the Lady of Quality. The<br />\nlady was the beautiful Lady Vane, whose<br />\namours were described in her memoirs, which<br />\nSmollett practically reproduced. It is unnecessary, and it was put in chiefly for the benefit<br />\nof the scandal mongers.<br />\nHis other novels are of much less importance<br />\nthan these two. Ferdenand Count Fathom,<br />\nThe Adventures of an Atom, Sir Launeelot<br />\nGraves, and Humphrey Clinker, complete the<br />\nlist. Of these, the first and the last are<br />\nworthy of mention.<br />\nFerdenand Count Fathom, is the adventures<br />\nof a young man, absolutely devoid of conscience, gratitude and courage, and incapable<br />\nof a genuine emotion. This admirable character betrays his master who had raised him,<br />\nlays traps for young girls, and does a variety of<br />\nother things on the same order. A more<br />\nsickening character has never been drawn in<br />\nthe whole of English literature. Finally,<br />\nthe hero reforms and marries a girl whom he<br />\nhad ruined before. Virtue came out supreme.<br />\nBut to say the least, it is not a moral or edifying tale.<br /><br />\n5<br /><br />\nHumphrey Clinker, is the last book Smollett<br />\never wrote, and in some respects the best of<br />\nthem all. Thackery said it was the most<br />\nlaughable book ever written. Certainly it is<br />\nthe kindest Sm011ett ever wrote. In it he<br />\nforgives everybody, even his own relations.<br />\nWhat could be more laughable than old<br />\nTabitha Brambles' persistent attempts at love.<br />\nThe book is a veritable history. Smollett<br />\nwrote of his own country, Scotland. All in<br />\nall, HumPhrey Clinker is the most \"good<br />\nnatured\" novel of Smollett's.<br />\nSmollett wrote of the low classes, and in<br />\nthis respect he was the forerunner of Dickens.<br />\nBut in turn, LeSage was the forerunner of<br />\nSmollett. It is only, however, in the class of<br />\ncharacters, that there is any resemblance to<br />\nDickens. Smollett wrote of the low classes<br />\nbecause he knew them. His favorite trick<br />\nwas to take for a hero a gentleman born, and<br />\nthen run him, surrounded by the lowest<br />\nsociety in England, through numberless chapters.<br />\nThe point in Smollett's novels most easily<br />\nassailed is the moral side. He claimed to be<br />\na moralist, but is he? The story of poor Miss<br />\nWilliams is undoubtedly written with the<br />\nmoral object in view. It is held up in all its<br />\nhorror. Vice is vice, and its consequences<br />\nare all put down. But with the exception of<br />\nthis, I do not think that there is anything in<br />\nSmollett calculated to have a good moral<br />\neffect. Of course we can consider Fathom as<br />\na sort of terrible example, but how many of<br />\nthe readers do? Is there anything calculated<br />\nto have a moral effect in Peregrine Pickle? We<br />\nfairly split our sides over some parts of it, but<br />\nit doesn't make us any better. Smollett, I<br />\nthink, uses the cloak of a moralist as a means<br />\nto introduce the low and the obscene. He has<br />\nneither the rigor of Richardson nor the open<br />\nbluffness of Fielding. He wants to be like<br />\nFielding, but he hasn't the courage to he so<br />\nopenly. No; Smollett is not moral. He is a<br />\ngreat humorist, but he is not a moralist.<br />\nWith Smollett passed away the old rough<br />\nand tumble novel of humor, of life on the<br />\nroad. It was for the best. They had diverted<br />\nthe stream of literature towards the realms of<br />\nfiction. Their successors were mightier than<br />\nthey were, but still we do not want to discard<br />\nthem completely. At the present day they<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br /><br />\n6<br /><br />\nare but little read, and perhaps that is for the<br />\nbest. There are two ways to be a moralist.<br />\nOne is to drag the reader down through the<br />\nfilth and mire of human depravity till, disgusted and nauseated, one turns in sheer desperation away. This is the course of the early<br />\nnovelists. The other is to so inspire the<br />\nreader, with the beauty of the true and the<br />\nhigh things in life that the love for them<br />\ncompletely crowds out the low and the vulgar.<br />\nHere, one turns to the higher things, not<br />\nthrough disgust and hatred for the low, but<br />\nfor the love of the better.<br />\nLet us appreciate Fielding, Richardson and<br />\nSmollett as best we can. They compose a<br />\nfield of literature comparatively unread. I do<br />\nnot seek to defend them, but I maintain that<br />\nthey, with all their coarseness and obscenity,<br />\nare far better than our modern fiction. Perhaps it is better to let them stay unread. They<br />\nwould not be appreciated by twentieth<br />\ncentury minds. Some would throw them<br />\naside, half read, disgusted and sick of them.<br />\nOthers would keep on in delight. To them it<br />\nwould be a fresh supply of 'gay reading.\" A<br />\nfew, a very few, would appreciate them. It<br />\nis to these few, then, that falls the duty to<br />\nkeep alive and fresh the memory of RichardW.<br />\nson, Fielding and Smollett.<br />\n[THE END.]<br /><br />\n\"SONGES SONT MENSONGES.\"<br />\n\"Thank you so much, Mr. Hall!

The quietude of the desert<br />\nreigned on board. All the passengers were<br />\ncomfortably wrapped up in their steamerchairs, either enjoying a short after-dinner<br />\nnap, or dreaming with eyes wide open.<br />\nFrom the stern the soft, plaintive tunes of a<br />\nviolin were heard, played by one of the crew<br />\nperchance in honor of his distant sweetheart.<br />\nJack Hall was leaning over the railing, gazing down upon the silvery pathway caused by<br />\nthe moon on the gentle undulating waves.<br />\nHe could not help thinking of those dangerous green siren eyes, now closed in sleep<br />\nunder the protecting rug. They had not<br />\nfailed to bewitch him the first time he had<br />\nlooked into then when at the first dinner on<br />\nboard he had found her sitting next to him.<br />\nSince that moment he had been completely<br />\nunder their spell and had become Eunice<br />\nGrosset's most faithful and perhaps most<br />\nsuccessful suitor, cutting out all of his many<br />\nrivals.<br />\nHe enjoyed the privilege of having his<br />\nsteamer-chair next to hers, he was allowed to<br />\nwrap her up and arrange her numerous<br />\npillows and to carry out her many small<br />\norders. Sure, she was so sweet and fascinating and he felt as if they were friends of old<br />\nand he knew she felt the same way.<br />\nJack Hall had not stirred for the last thirty<br />\nminutes, gazing upon the play of the moon<br />\nrays on the water it seemed to him as if some<br />\nmermaids were dancing there, and strange to<br />\nsay, one of them was fixing her green phos-<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br /><br />\nphorescent eyes upon him\u2014why, she looked<br />\nlike Eunice, he thought. \"You're moonstruck, old chap,\" he murmured, \u2022'I'll have<br />\nto tell Eunice about my vision.\" He found<br />\nEunice sound asleep and so\u2014faute de mieux<br />\n\u2014followed her example and was soon slumbering away to the isle of dreams.<br />\nAll of a sudden, the liner stopped abruptly,<br />\nthrowing everyone on the floor. Shrieking,<br />\nrunning,\u2014yelling. \"Something wrong with<br />\nthe propellers,\" howled the Chief Engineer<br />\nafter a 'few moments of anxious expectation.<br />\nTwo men were ordered to investigate. After<br />\na short while they reappeared above the railing<br />\n\u2014a broad grill on their faces. They reported<br />\nthat the propellers were entangled in a mass<br />\nof sea-weed and that there were some mermaids down there, one of whom demanded<br />\nthe youngest man on board to come down<br />\nto her immediately, or else the whole ship<br />\nwould be wrecked.<br />\nJack was looking around in order to find to<br />\nfind tile poor chap who would have to sacrifice himself for the benefit of his fellowpassengers, when the Captain tipped him on<br />\nhis shoulder. \"Mr. Hall,\" he said, \"the<br />\nChief Steward after looking over the passenger<br />\nlist, informs me, that you are the youngest<br />\nman, and so, I'm afraid, you're the man<br />\nwanted down there.\"<br />\n\"What I, am I the youngest?\" yelled Jack.<br />\n'Yes, I'm sorry.'<br />\n\"So am I. I'm not going down there.\"<br />\n\"Well we'll see about that\" said the Captain cruelly, and before Jack knew what happened he felt himself lifted up by brutal hands<br />\nand thrown overboard. It seemed to him as<br />\nif he were flying thru the air for more than<br />\nan hour, before he finally safely landed in an<br />\nimmense shell at the side of the beautiful mermaid who had stared at him, while he was<br />\nwatching her dancing.<br />\n\"Take this stone, sweet mortal, it will protect you from the waters,\" she said to our<br />\nspeechless Jack, *handing him a- big emerald.<br />\nShe then blew a silver-whistle and instantly<br />\nthe shell began to sink slowly until it finally<br />\nlanded before a large grot. The mermaid<br />\ntook Jack by the hand and led him thru the<br />\nlabyrinth of passage until she finally dragged<br />\nhim into a beautifully furnished room. Throwing herself on a lounge, she drew Jack to her.<br /><br />\n7<br /><br />\nClasping her beautiful white, but ice-cold arms<br />\naround his neck, she whispered: \"I love you<br />\nso much, angel-pie!\"<br />\n\"This is so very sudden, indeed, I just met<br />\nyou Miss,\" stammered Jack\u2014\"you see, I<br />\ndon't even know your name.\" \"Name\u2014you<br />\nare so funny, beloved mortal, what is this, a<br />\nname?\"<br />\n\"Yes, you're right, what's in a name? but<br />\nyou see, I would like to know now how your<br />\npeople call you.\"<br />\n\"They call me Queen!\" she answered<br />\nproudly.<br />\n\"All right then Miss Queen, as I was<br />\ngoing\u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \"<br />\n\"Oh, precious, don't waste time talking,\"<br />\nshe interrupted him impatiently, \"kiss me,<br />\nkiss me, my liberator, and tell me, that you<br />\nlove me, as I love you, you spell-breaker!\"<br />\n\"Spell\u2014<br />\n\"Yes, don't you know that my father, who<br />\nwanted me to marry one of those ugly Tritons<br />\ndown here, although he knew that I was crazy<br />\nabout a navy-lieutenant,\u2014I don't think of<br />\nhim any more, now that I have you, my idol\u2014<br />\nwell, you see, at that time I refused to marry<br />\nthat Triton and consequently my father\u2014you<br />\nknow him, he'll do a thing like that, when<br />\nhe's mad, so he wove a spell over me, that I<br />\nshould never feel love's joys and sorrows again<br />\nunless a mortal could stand the gaze of my eyes<br />\nfor five minutes. I've tried in vain to find the<br />\nbrave one;they all turned away blinded.You my<br />\nhero, my gallant Knight, looked into my eyes<br />\nlonger than the required time.

I know what love is, I can love<br />\nagain, love again!!!\" she shouted, frantic with<br />\njoy, covering his mouth, his eyes, his whole<br />\nface with glowing kisses. Jack, who so far<br />\nhad felt rather uneasy, did not object to this<br />\nkind of treatment\u2014nor, why should he, would<br />\nyou?\u2014but, brought up to be polite, he returned her caresses with the same ardour\u2014 \u2014<br />\nAt last, when both really had to gasp for<br />\nbreath, Jack jumped up and pulling out his<br />\nwatch cried: \"Oh, Great Scott, is it as late as<br />\nthat; past eleven! ! I'm distressed, that I<br />\noverstayed the time. Eleven is your limit, I<br />\nsuppose.

He had<br />\nbeen receding slowly towards the door and<br />\nwith a desperate leap tried to get out, but she<br />\nheld him by his sleeve.<br />\n\"Leave me,\" he cried, now getting really<br />\nmad, \"this farce has been going on too long<br />\nany way.\"<br />\n\"You are very polite indeed\" she answered<br />\nin a somewhat changed voice, as Jack thought.<br />\n\"The idea of your proposing to me\u2014!\"<br />\n\"But, Mr.\u2014\"<br />\n\"Aw, let me continue, I'm tired of this.

He had<br /><br />\nstared at the beautiful creature, whom her<br />\nfury made all the more attractive, as if she<br />\nwere a supernatural phantom. Her weeping<br />\nbrought him back to earth; he simply could<br />\nnot stand seeing a girl in tears, so timidly<br />\nlaying his hand on her arm, he said with all<br />\nthe gentleness and tenderness he was capable<br />\nof in a rueful tone: \"But, dear Miss<br />\nEunice\u2014 \u2014\"<br />\nBut Eunice jumped up and ,with flashing<br />\neyes, phosphorescent in the half-dark, she<br />\ncried: \"How dare you touch my arm, how<br />\ndare you call me by my first name!

JOHN'S, 0\u2014HOPKINS, 0.<br />\nBy the time this article appears the great<br />\ngame with St. John's, in common with all<br />\ngreat games, will have become but a memory,<br />\nthe echoes of the cheering that followed<br />\nMusser's wonderful one-hand back tackle will<br />\nbe almost dead \"in yon rich sky,\" the yells<br />\nthat greeted Bridgman as he emerged, clad in<br />\nhalf a jersey and a lot of mud, after his twelveyard line plunge, will have likewise faded into<br />\nthe rapidily receding past. And yet it is but<br />\nfittiiig that some attempt, at least, be made to<br />\ncause the memory of this game of games to<br />\nlinger a while in the hearts of all true Hopkins<br />\nmen,for it was the enthusiasm that the struggle evoked that proved that love for his<br />\nUniversity is the great passion of the Hopkins<br />\nman, that he would brave rain, snow and<br />\nthe various other kinds of weather, the<br />\nnecessity of standing throughout an entire<br />\ngame, the danger from Dr. Wood's boomerangs, and, above all, the expectation of almost<br />\ncertain defeat, in order to come out and root<br />\nfor his team.<br />\nIt would be useless to speak here of the<br />\nmeetings and yell practices that preceeded the<br />\ngame, to tell bow \"Purd'n's\" voice sounded<br />\nlike a fog-horn in the distance, with a spring<br />\nloose. Everybody remembers it all, and everybody remembers, too, the consequent magnificent showing the horde of the faithful made,<br />\nas, armed with its red, white and blue megaphones, it rooted for the pluckiest team the<br />\nUniversity ever put out.<br />\nThere is no need to speak here of the game<br />\nitself. The whole student-body was out there<br />\nand saw the confidence with which the St.<br />\nJohn's followers gave odds on the result, and<br />\nthe surprise with which they viewed the gains<br />\n-made by the Hopkins back field. They were<br />\nsurprised at the work of Abel, Bridgman,<br />\nStollenwerck and Chesney, but they groaned<br />\nin very truth when their own much-vaunted<br />\nCaptain Quimby, Bosley and Warfield failed<br />\nto pierce the adamant opposing line. Nor<br />\nwere their end runs any more successful.<br />\nThey played a great game, but the advantage<br />\nall the way was with the Black and Blue. The<br />\nodds were against Hopkins, but, backed by its<br />\nmadly enthusiastic rooters and its brass band,<br />\nit put the glory of St. John's to the blush.<br />\nTo be sure, the score does not give this<br /><br />\n9<br /><br />\nUniversity a victory, but in reality the game<br />\nwas more than a victory. It was a grand<br />\ntriumph for Hopkins spirit.<br />\nThe line-up:<br />\nMusser '<br />\nLeft End<br />\nC. Tilghman<br />\nLeft Tackle<br />\nR. Tilghman<br />\nLeft Guard<br />\nMaddren,<br />\nCentre<br />\nBlanck<br />\nRight Guard<br />\nStockton<br />\nRight Tackle<br />\nRidgely<br />\nRight End<br />\nStollenwerk<br />\nQuarter-back<br />\nChesney<br />\nLeft Halfback<br />\nAbel, McCabe<br />\nRight Halfback<br />\nBridgman<br />\nFullback<br /><br />\nHOPKINS, 7\u2014UNIVERSITY OF MARYLAND, 0.<br />\nOur eleven placed a fitting end to a season<br />\nthat started anything but successfully by defeating the University of Maryland 7 to 0 in the<br />\nannual Thanksgiving game. An old saying<br />\nhas it that \"victory comes to him that waits,\"<br />\nand that fits our case exactly. We have been<br />\nwaiting the entire season for a victory and at<br />\nlast our team has earned one. The credit of<br />\nthis victory is due to the magnificent work of<br />\nthe Black and Blue line. Every man showed<br />\nthe \"do or die\" spirit and played with every<br />\nounce of strength and spirit that he could<br />\nsummon. Blank and Stockton were impregnable on the right wing and Morse and<br />\nTilghman gave way but little before the continuous, hammering plunges of the Maroon<br />\nand Black backs. In fact our fellows held for<br />\ndowns no less than five times.<br />\nThe game was throughout a succession of<br />\ngruelling line plunges and punts. Open plays<br />\nwere seldom used and when they were tried<br />\nthey were unsuccessful. In offensive work<br />\nour fellows showed a decided reversal of form<br />\nfrom the St. John's game. Somehow or<br />\nother the plays would not work right. This<br />\nwas probably due to the absence of Abel and<br />\nto the fact that Blake, the University captain,<br />\ncovered Chesney closely during the entire<br />\ngame and did not give him a chance to break<br />\nloose. Hopkins kicked to University of Maryland, who started immediately to march down<br />\nthe field toward our goal. Our fellows held,<br />\nthough, in about mid-field and started to do a<br /><br />\n10<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br /><br />\nlittle line plunging of their own, but the ball<br />\nwas soon lost on a faulty forward pass. After<br />\nthe pigskin had exchanged hands, Hopkins<br />\nadvanced the ball as far as the 30 yard line,<br />\nwhere Stollenwerk tried for a field goal but<br />\nmissed. After this the Marylanders steadily<br />\ngained ground and the half ended with the<br />\nball in their possession on the 30 yard line.<br />\nToward the end of the half Stollenwerk<br />\nsprained his shoulder and was replaced in the<br />\nsecond half by Chesney.<br />\nOur fellows started the second half strong.<br />\nStewart received the kick-off and ran the ball<br />\nback ten yards before being tackled. Then a<br />\ndouble pass to McCabe netted ten more yards.<br />\nAt this point our fellows were penallized for<br />\nan off-side play, and Chesney was forced to<br />\npunt. The ball was kicked perfectly and<br />\nsailed hard and low just over the quarterback's head and landed behind the University of Maryland's goal line. Wendell picked<br />\nup the ball and started to run with it but was<br />\ntackle behind the goal line by Morse, and the<br />\nscore stood 2 to 0 in our favor. After this<br />\ncame the hardest playing of the game.<br />\nUniversity of Maryland sent its backs time<br />\nafter time against our tackles, but our line<br />\nfought gamely and held their opponents for<br />\ndowns three times within 20 yards of our<br />\ngoal. It was only in the last five minutes of<br />\nplay that the Black and Blue attack showed<br />\nits characteristic speed. Ridgely secured the<br />\nball from a fumble on the Marylanders' 30<br />\nyard line. Two plunges failed and then our<br />\nteam worked the neatest trick of the game.<br />\nThe tackles were shifted over as if the play<br />\nwas to be toward the center of the field, and<br />\nit was on this that the Maroon and Black<br />\nbacks \"bit,\" for Chesney fell back, made a<br />\nforward pass to Ridgely, who ran unmolested<br />\nto the two and a half yard line before being<br />\ntackled. Thcn after two downs, Stewart<br />\nplowed through left tackle for the touchdown. With two minutes more to play, the<br />\nUniversity of Maryland team left the field in<br />\ndisgust, with the referee, as they put it, but<br />\nin reality with themselves.<br />\nThe game was the most successful of the<br />\nseason from a pecuniary as well as an athletic<br />\nstandpoint, for there were almost 3000 paid<br />\nadmissions. Our rooters were also out in<br />\nforce and cheered with a right good will.<br /><br />\nThe only disagreeable feature was the evident<br />\nill-feeling of the University of Maryland<br />\nrooters toward Hopkins. The hissing of our<br />\nteam as it came out on the field and the unnecessary rough tactics of the University of<br />\nMaryland team will hardly add to the feeling<br />\nof friendly rivalry that has heretofore existed<br />\nbetween the two universities.<br /><br />\nJUNIORS, 6-FRESHMEN, 0.<br />\nThose who journeyed to Mt. Washington<br />\non Friday, December 6, were well repaid for<br />\nany uncomfortableness which they may have<br />\nfelt in the lower portions of their anatomy.<br />\nThere was a fine crowd, quite as many as<br />\nattended the St. John's game, and there was<br />\nmore than one fair face to spur on the warring<br />\ngladiators. Those same gladiators needed no<br />\nspurring, however! Rarely has there been<br />\nsuch intense rivalry between two classes.<br />\nIn the first place the Freshmen had a larger<br />\nnumber of good individual players, than had<br />\nthe Juniors. Then the Juniors lost Michael,<br />\nand this fact tended to' give the younger fellows more confidence. Realizing this, the<br />\nJuniors set to work with a determination that<br />\nwas laudable, and in the end, won a victory<br />\nwhich was well deserved. Much credit is due<br />\nCaptain Baily for the way in which he gathered his material together and developed a<br />\nwell-drilled, plucky eleven.<br />\nThe Freshmen were slower to organize, and<br />\ndid not acquire team work to the degree that<br />\nthe 1909 team did. Nevertheless, they put<br />\nup a plucky fight, and, in the first half, by<br />\nthe use of two neat fortvard passes, put the<br />\nball within ten yards of the posts, but could<br />\nnot score. As a matter of fact, they played<br />\nbetter than was expected by them, but they<br />\nweakened visibly in the second half, when<br />\nthey rarely made first down. Had it not<br />\nbeen for fumbling in the Junior line, the<br />\nFreshmen would not have loomed so dangerous as they did at times. As is usual in class<br />\ngames, neither team could gain consistently<br />\nfor any length of time.<br />\nThe playing of Baily, the Junior captain, is<br />\nespecially worthy of commendation. His<br />\nwork was the bright part of.the game. Twice<br />\nhe crossed the Freshman goal line, after most<br />\nbrilliant runs, but one of the touchdowns was<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br /><br />\n11<br /><br />\nnot allowed because of offside play.
