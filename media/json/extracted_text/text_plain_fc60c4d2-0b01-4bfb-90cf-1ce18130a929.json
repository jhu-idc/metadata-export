Placed at various prominent points on the campus are<br />\nneat little reminding signs bearing the unoffensive admonition,<br />\n\"Make for a Pathless Campus.\"<br />\nThese signs have done a great<br />\ndeal toward making the Swarthmore campus what it is today\u2014<br />\none of the most beautiful college<br />\nsettings in the United States. '<br />\nIt is with sorrow and shame<br />\nthat we observe \"cow paths\" daily<br />\nincreasing in prominence at several conspicuous points on the<br />\nHopkins campus. We know that<br />\nit is awfully easy to take short<br />\ncuts between the buildings, but<br />\nwhy not take thirty seconds longer and use the walks that are provided. One very easily gets in the<br />\nhabit of making certain short cuts<br />\nall the time. This is all right when<br />\none is in a hurry to get to class.<br />\nbut it is pure laziness when there<br />\nis plenty of time. When we consider' how much a pathless campus aids the appearance of the<br />\nUniversity, and how little trouble<br />\nit is to get out of the short cut<br />\nhabit, it should not be hard to enlist the hearty co-operation of the<br />\nentire student body in aiding to<br />\npreserve the beauty of our grassy<br />\nlawns.<br />\nAs the habitual offenders might<br />\nfind it rather hard at first to break<br />\nthemselves of their lazy habits,<br />\nwe would suggest that the Student Council erect notices similar<br />\nto those at Swarthmore and then<br />\nmake it a matter of pride to prevent the formation of any more<br />\nugly short cuts. These notices<br />\nwould not be offensive or abrupt,<br />\nbut would simply be a gentle reminder given in the spirit of cooperation and good fellowship.<br />\n<br />\nV(<br />\n<br />\nol<br />\n<br />\nCLOTHES<br />\n211-213 E.

Placed at various prominent points on the campus are<br />\nneat little reminding signs bearing the unoffensive admonition,<br />\n\"Make for a Pathless Campus.\"<br />\nThese signs have done a great<br />\ndeal toward making the Swarthmore campus what it is today\u2014<br />\none of the most beautiful college<br />\nsettings in the United States. '<br />\nIt is with sorrow and shame<br />\nthat we observe \"cow paths\" daily<br />\nincreasing in prominence at several conspicuous points on the<br />\nHopkins campus. We know that<br />\nit is awfully easy to take short<br />\ncuts between the buildings, but<br />\nwhy not take thirty seconds longer and use the walks that are provided. One very easily gets in the<br />\nhabit of making certain short cuts<br />\nall the time. This is all right when<br />\none is in a hurry to get to class.<br />\nbut it is pure laziness when there<br />\nis plenty of time. When we consider' how much a pathless campus aids the appearance of the<br />\nUniversity, and how little trouble<br />\nit is to get out of the short cut<br />\nhabit, it should not be hard to enlist the hearty co-operation of the<br />\nentire student body in aiding to<br />\npreserve the beauty of our grassy<br />\nlawns.<br />\nAs the habitual offenders might<br />\nfind it rather hard at first to break<br />\nthemselves of their lazy habits,<br />\nwe would suggest that the Student Council erect notices similar<br />\nto those at Swarthmore and then<br />\nmake it a matter of pride to prevent the formation of any more<br />\nugly short cuts. These notices<br />\nwould not be offensive or abrupt,<br />\nbut would simply be a gentle reminder given in the spirit of cooperation and good fellowship.<br /><br />\nV(<br /><br />\nol<br /><br />\nCLOTHES<br />\n211-213 E.
