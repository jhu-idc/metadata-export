Every year teams from<br />\nthese universities would compete<br />\nagainst each other seeking to carry<br />\noff the debating honors.<br />\nTwo weeks ago the debating team<br />\ntook a trip and met Pittsburgh,.Buffalo, and Niagara Universities. Debates, arranged with two other colleges, had to be cancelled owing to<br />\nunforeseen circumstances.

Granger<br />\nRough Cut is tobacco whittled right . . . that's one<br />\nreason why it burns so slow<br />\nand cool.<br />\nHEN we started to make Granger<br />\nRough Cut we knew that fine tobacco burnt hot because it burnt so fast. It<br />\nkept your pipe hot. You could hardly<br />\nhold your pipe in your hand, it got so<br />\nhot at times.<br />\nThen we remembered that some folks<br />\nback yonder used to \"whittle\" their tobacco. So we made GRANGER just like<br />\n\"whittle\" tobacco \u2014 \"Rough Cut.\" It<br />\nsmokes cooler and lasts a lot longer. And<br />\nalso, you'll find it never gums the pipe.<br />\nSo far, so good. Now we wanted to sell<br />\nthis tobacco for 10c. Good tobacco\u2014right<br />\nprocess\u2014cut right. It was a question of<br />\nhow to do it for the price.<br />\nSo we put GRANGER in a sensible soft<br />\nfoil pouch instead ofan expensive package,<br />\nknowing that a man can't smoke a package.<br />\nWe gave smokers this good GRANGER<br />\ntobacco in a common-sense pouch for 10c.<br />\nGRANGER has not been on sale very<br />\nlong, but it has grown to be a popular<br />\nsmoke. And there is this much about it<br />\n\u2014we have yet to know of a man who<br />\nstarted to smoke it, who didn't keep on.<br />\nFolks seem to like it.<br /><br />\nW<br /><br />\n4eitvo4uaxiccod<br /><br />\n(C) 1933<br />\nLIGGETT &amp; MYERS<br />\nTOBACCO CO.<br /><br />\nThe Granger pouch<br />\nkeeps the tobacco fresh<br /><br />\nTEN CENTS<br /><br />"}], "field_media_file": [{"target_id": 38734, "display": null, "description": null, "target_type": "file", "target_uuid": "b90c7825-2bd9-4781-8ab3-c92f2ecfb6fb", "url": "http://digital.library.jhu.edu/system/files/2022-03/12413-Extracted%20Text.txt"}], "field_media_of": [{"target_id": 12413, "target_type": "node", "target_uuid": "269d16e3-2982-4b9a-88bc-cc46ec0b1935", "url": "/node/12413"}], "field_media_use": [{"target_id": 15, "target_type": "taxonomy_term", "target_uuid": "c6a3a700-c007-4c4f-b77a-403d89b54878", "url": "/taxonomy/term/15"}], "field_mime_type": [{"value": "text/plain"}], "field_restricted_access": [], "field_unique_id": [{"value": "4ff44da7-9f55-4951-ab5c-f89f79fe6612"}]}
