When they left campus or were<br />\nat home they found themselves taking<br />\ncare of themselves again. And when they<br />\n<br />\nreturned from vacation they were back<br />\nwith clean clothes and some self-respect.<br />\nUntil the cycle started up again. No<br />\nironing until next vacation.<br />\nI spent nearly two years as a slob.<br />\nIt was horribly depressing.

Would it<br />\nbe wiser to succumb, gratify their desires<br />\nand live with the memory of how I never<br />\nreally proved myself in an intellectual<br />\ncapacity, or would it be wiser to ignore<br />\ntheir insulting leers and risk professional<br />\nostracism because they were threatened<br />\nby my intellectual prowess?<br />\nWhile ruminating over this problem in the library, the answer struck me.<br />\nJust looking around I could see how so<br />\nmany other guys dealt with the problem.<br />\nApparently, the question was not how to<br />\n<br />\nI was scared,<br />\nfrightened by the<br />\ndilemma I was<br />\npresented with...<br />\nsurvive as an attractive guy, but rather,<br />\nhow to make those professors desire<br />\nme less!<br />\nThe answer was all too clear.<br />\nUntil that revelation I had thought that<br />\nmost Hopkins guys were simply slobs or<br />\nlazy. They took no care of their appearance. They seldom washed their clothes,<br />\nnever ironed them. They let their corn-<br />\n<br />\ncouldn't help but feel that they were only<br />\ninterested in my body.<br />\nI talked to my father about it. \"It<br />\nwas the same at Hopkins when I was<br />\nthere in the early fifties. I guess it's<br />\nalways been that way.\" He got a far-off<br />\nmelancholy look in his eye as he spoke.<br />\n\"We really thought we could change it,<br />\nlet them know we were more than<br />\nbodies.\"<br />\nI asked what had happened.<br />\nHe replied sadly,\"I don't know, it<br />\njust sort of died. Next thing I knew I was<br />\nmarried and raising a family. I love my<br />\nfamily but still you sometimes wonder...<br />\nwhat if.\"<br />\n<br />\nI was infuriated. Twenty five<br />\nyears had gone by and Hopkins hadn't<br />\nchanged. Female professors were still<br />\ntaking advantage of men. We were<br />\nrespected no more than our fathers were.<br />\nThe equality movement that's been<br />\nsweeping the nation has passed us by.<br />\nBut we don't have to take it any<br />\nlonger. The age has come for us to<br />\nexpress our sexuality and compete<br />\nequally. By retaining the look that has<br />\n\"nurd\" written all over it we are still<br />\nslaves to their desires. The time has come<br />\nwhen a man can wear finely tailored<br />\nsports coats to class, unbutton your shirt,<br />\nexpose some chest hair.<br />\nRight now there's not a female<br />\nprofessor in the country who can afford<br />\nto be openly accused of sexual harrassment. You don't have to be ashamed to<br />\nmake charges openly. The shame of<br />\nadmitting that it happens has allowed the<br />\nsystem to go unchanged.<br />\nI've heard of cases where men<br />\nhave faced the added embarrassment of<br />\nbeing told by their school's academic<br />\ncouncil that they deserved harrassment,<br />\nthat unbuttoning the top button or two<br />\nand smiling at the professor only led her<br />\non, and that it was in fact his fault.<br />\n<br />\nThe shame of<br />\nadmitting that it<br />\nhappens allowed<br />\nthe system to go<br />\nunchanged<br />\nThis is, to say the least, a disgrace.<br />\nNo such case has come up before the JHU<br />\nAcademic Council but when it does we<br />\nmen better by damn sure that we won't<br />\nlet the women of that council embarrass<br />\nus further.<br />\n<br />\nthe move toward<br />\nequality and<br />\nmutual respect<br />\nmust start now!<br />\nI have chosen the most difficult<br />\npath for my last year. I am not afraid to<br />\nbe attractive. If female professors .harass<br />\nme I shall do my best to see that they are<br />\npenalized. And I shall let my work stand<br />\nas my record of intellectual capability.<br />\nThis will be very difficult and I'm sure<br />\nthat my grades will suffer. But the move<br />\ntowards equality and mutual respect<br />\nmust start now!<br />\n[I have requested that my name<br />\nnot be mentioned as females are in<br />\npowerful positions throughout the University. The professors, I will face as<br />\nnecessary, but alone, I would rather not<br />\nantagonize the entire female community<br />\nof Hopkins.

And as styles change,so<br />\ndoes that which one's living space is<br />\nsupposed to express.<br />\nWe all remember how Le Corbusier's maxim \"Form follows Function\"<br />\nrevolutionized interior decorating. Now,<br />\nin some circles there is a return to the<br />\n\"High tech\" mechanization of the Le<br />\nCorbusien doctrine.<br />\nAnd what man can forget the<br />\nonslaught of the sterile, clean environment. We were told that it was best to<br />\nexpress the more \"feminine\" side of our<br />\npersonalities, that neat and clean were<br />\nsymbols of our newly found sensitivity.<br />\nBut today, the \"Me Decade\" has<br />\nfinally caught up with interior decorating.<br />\nAnd at the same time, one interpretation<br />\nof \"Form follows function\" is incorporated into our new decorating scheme.<br />\n<br />\nIf you're<br />\ncomfortable<br />\nleaving your bed<br />\nunmade,don't<br />\nmake it<br />\nA college man's apartment serves<br />\ntwo purposes: first it is a place to live,\"to<br />\nlive\" incorporates eating, sleeping, entertaining, and all that we do for ourselves,<br />\nthe other purpose is a place to study.<br />\nThus it is no longer necessary to<br />\nkeep things which impede your studying<br />\nor living. But most importantly,and here<br />\nenters the \"me\" aspect, you should no<br />\nlonger feel tied to conventions of what<br />\nconstitutes a \"home.\" If you're comfortable leaving your bed unmade, don't<br />\nmake it. A made bed impeds the true<br />\nfunction. Why make a bed just to unmake it? It's much easier to leave it as is<br />\nin the morning and pick up where you<br />\nleft off that night.<br />\n<br />\nThe same is true of things. Dishes<br />\nwill only procede to get dirty. Books put<br />\non shelves will have to be taken off again.<br />\nAll this menial housework stands opposed<br />\nto the functions of your apartment,living<br />\nand studying.<br />\nSome friends ask me if this type<br />\nof apartment living isn't worrisome when<br />\nentertaining. I don't think so. Be yourself and let people see the real you, not<br />\nthe \"well-mannered\" or \"trained\" you<br />\nthat makes us all so similar, but the you<br />\nbeneath all of that. If you drink a lot of<br />\nbeer, let people know it. Don't feel you<br />\nhave to hide the empty bottles. If<br />\nyou had spaghetti last night, don't be<br />\nashamed, plenty of people eat spaghetti let the dishes rest! If you smoke a lot,let<br />\nthe ashtrays overflow; besides, you never<br />\nknow when you'll run out.<br />\nYou see, there's nothing wrong<br />\nwith being yourself and letting people see<br />\nhow you're most comfortable. The<br />\nfunction is your comfort, and the style is<br />\nyou.<br />\n\"But,\" you may ask, \"what if I<br />\nThe apartment came<br />\ncan't be me?<br />\nfurnished and doesn't express me.\" This<br />\nproblem arises frequently for the college<br />\nman. The answer is simple. The new style<br />\nis not to set guidelines or to consult rule<br />\nbooks; you don't have to put the typewriter on the typing table. You can do<br />\nwhatever you want. Just as you consider<br />\nthe layout of the apartment a \"given,\" so<br />\ntoo is the furniture that comes with it. If<br />\nyou don't like it, bury it. For this you<br />\ncan use your clothes or some old newspaper.<br />\n\"But I share a place with someone. What if ME and HIM clash.\" The<br />\nonly thing I find more invigorating than a<br />\nBach fugue is the counterpoint of two<br />\ndifferent ME styles expressed simultaneously. If your roommate can't stand<br />\nthe way you leave your things lying<br />\naround, leave his things lying around<br />\ninstead. The dichotomy of separate ME<br />\nstyles is particularly interesting when<br />\nentertaining. Newcomers to your place<br />\nwill expose their true opinions of you.

New<br />\nstudies released by the Johns Hopkins<br />\nUniversity Center for Fat Control reveal<br />\nnew ways to peel off those pounds.<br />\n<br />\nAlimentary<br />\nRegurgitation<br />\nAction<br />\nScientists discovered that freshman<br />\non Hopkins' own Homewood campus<br />\nachieved drastic weight-loss after several<br />\nweeks of dorm living. Interestingly<br />\nenough, students- question reported no<br />\ndecrease of food intake. Scientists found,<br />\nupon closer observation and questioning,<br />\nthat the students were unable to keep the<br />\ncafeteria food down, and consequently,<br />\ncounld lose weight regardless of the<br />\namount of food intake. While some<br />\nstudents praise the pound-loss plan, it<br />\ndoes have some minor negative side<br />\neffects. Consult your doctor first before<br />\ntrying this diet. Persons of normal weight<br />\nor under should not attempt this plan.<br />\n41 *<br />\n<br />\n*<br />\n<br />\n4. *\u2022*<br />\n<br />\n*<br />\n<br />\n*<br />\n<br />\nThe Robert0.<br />\nCoca-Cola Diet<br />\nThis plan offers a safe, easy method<br />\nfor dispairing dieters. It includes only<br />\none meal a day, to be ingested at whatever time and to consist of as much food<br />\nas the dieter can cram into his or her<br />\nmouth. Fast food franchises provide the<br />\nideal quickness, quantity, and quality<br />\nneeded although any food will do. At<br />\nany other time of the day or night, the<br />\ndiet may be supplemented with CocaCola only. The corbonation in this drink<br />\nhas the effect of filling you with gas so<br />\nthat you feel full, while the caffeine<br />\nspeeds up you metabolism and burns off<br />\nthose nasty calories.

Gosh, it was great to be<br />\nalive. He leafed through his notebook, admiring his day's work:<br />\npages and pages of observations and<br />\ncalculations. His equations were so<br />\nfinely, so precisely balanced they<br />\nbrought a tear of pride to his eye.<br />\nAh,science.<br />\nHe made his way back to the<br />\ndorms with his book-bag slung<br />\nintellectually over his shoulder.<br />\nStrolling past the insensitive jocks,<br />\nguitar-slinging artist-types, and<br />\npseudo-intellectual newspaper reporters that littered the quad,<br />\nWendell couldn't help noticing how<br />\nmuch better he was than any of<br />\nthem. He had motivation, he had<br />\npurpose! He could<br />\ndrive, had<br />\njust imagine all the admissions<br />\ndirectors of the East Coast's finest<br />\nmedical schools clamoring over<br />\nwhich of them would get the honor<br />\nof accepting him, Wendell Fortinbras, into their hallowed academy.<br />\nThe thought made him beam with<br />\nhappiness and he carried himself<br />\nthrough the quad like a prince.<br />\nUpstairs in his single, Wendell<br />\ntook a seat at this desk beneath the<br />\nwindow and began puttering with<br />\nhis calculator, occasionally gazing<br />\nout over the quad while waiting for<br />\ntrig functions to register. After<br />\nsolving a particularly difficult sinewave problem (of his own device),<br />\nhe happened to glance outside and<br />\ncatch a glimpse of Carolene Bettelheim as she crossed over to the<br />\ncafeteria. His glasses slipped off his<br />\nface.<br />\nWendell was in love with<br />\nCarolene Bettelheim: hopelessly,<br />\ndesperately in love, for she was<br />\ntotally unaware of his existence.<br />\nHe had tracked her down in the<br />\nFreshman Register and the Student<br />\nDirectory, knew everything about<br />\nher. She was an I.R. major from<br />\nDarien, Connecticut whose wardrobe consisted almost entirely of<br />\nsweaters, jeans and gym outfits<br />\nthat seemed to take on lives their<br />\nown when she wore them. Her<br />\nfigure was a marvel of geometry,<br />\na flawless juxtaposition of bellcurves and apexes that could cause<br />\neven the staunchest Quaker to start<br />\nacting like Mighty Joe Young.<br />\nWendell worshipped her. He had<br />\neven written poems dedicated to<br />\nher, and now he pulled one out at<br />\nrandom from a sheaf of papers on<br />\nhis desk and examined it:<br />\n<br />\n9tElfinzan SVo.i9<br />\nWatzEn<br />\n<br />\nsnickered and nudged the guy<br />\nsitting next to him, a football<br />\nplayer, by mistake. The guy stared<br />\nhim down until Trent finally<br />\nfumbled his apologies.<br />\n\"So you'll go?\" he said,<br />\nturning back to Wendell, beads of<br />\nnervous perspiration on his forehead.<br />\n\"Yes.\"<br />\n\"Great. I'll come past about<br />\nnine, then. Can I have that if<br />\n\"Come on Wendell, have you're not eating it?\"<br />\nsome fun. It's only a party. Gee<br />\nWendell sat in the corner<br />\nwhiz.\" Trent was talking between<br />\nsipping a Coke and trying to look<br />\nmouthfuls of tuna casserole.<br />\n\"Tonight?\" Wendell repeat- interested. The music was loud, the<br />\ned. \"I don't know. I've got a paper people were strangers.

Wendell cursed<br />\nhis luck. Why couldn't he meet up<br />\nwith a girl like that? He knew more<br />\nabout DNA than Trent did, and<br />\nTrent had pimples besides. Fate<br />\ncertainly was cruel.<br />\nWendell reached the bottom<br />\nglass and stood, preparing to<br />\nthe<br />\nof<br />\nhe spotted a group of<br />\nwhen<br />\nleave,<br />\ngirls huddled together nearby, giggling. One of them was staring<br />\nright at him.<br />\nIt was Carolene Bettelheim.<br />\nWendell was stunned. She looked<br />\nravishing, as usual, but now she had<br />\na funny sort of gleam in her eye,<br />\nand she was softly pursing and<br />\nunpursing her lips. Looking right at<br />\nhim! He could barely stand still.<br />\nAnd now (could it be?) she was<br />\ntaking a step in his direction!<br />\n<br />\nOrchestras boomed in Wendell's<br />\nhead. \"Oh, sweet mystery of life...\"<br />\nShe broke away from the<br />\nbunch and approached him, a<br />\nhalf-empty beer in her hand.<br />\n\"You're dribbling,\" she said.<br />\n\"Wh-what?\" He had crunched<br />\na piece of ice between his teeth and<br />\nnow it was leaking all over his chin.<br />\n\"Let me clean you up.\" The<br />\ngirls were laughing louder, but<br />\nWendell paid no attention. He was<br />\nstaring down deep into Carolene's<br />\nchocolatey brown eyes. She led<br />\nhim to a table where she took a<br />\nnapkin and began wiping his face.<br />\n\"What's your name?\" she asked.<br />\n\"Wendell.\"<br />\n\"I love it.\"<br />\n\"You do?\"<br />\n\"Sure.

Could this<br />\nreally be happening?\"W-want rue?\"<br />\n\"Yes,\" she hissed seductively. \"Now.\" The breeze blew her<br />\nhair back in silky waves. She<br />\nmoistened her lips with her tongue.<br />\n\"Let's go.\"<br />\nHis heart pounded like a<br />\npiston.

Wendell Fortinbras,<br />\npre-med, had taken advantage of a<br />\ngirl! Led her'on! \"You cad!\" he<br />\nshouted. \"How could you!\" No,<br />\nshe wasn't an untouchable freshman love goddess, she was just. . .a<br />\ngirl. A poor infatuated girl. And<br />\nnow another, more haunting<br />\nthought hit him: had he completely<br />\nruined his chances for a brilliant<br />\ncareer in private practice?<br />\nGuilt plagued him throughout the day. By dinnertime he<br />\ncould stand it no longer and he<br />\nburst out of the D-Level carrels in a<br />\nsweat, mumbling incoherently.<br />\nIt's not worth it, he told<br />\nhimself in the elevator up to the<br />\nmain floor of the library. Love<br />\nsimply must take a back seat to<br />\nstudy, there was no getting around<br />\nit. He would have to tell Carotene<br />\nright away, before she started<br />\ngetting serious. Sure, she would<br />\nbe hurt, but it would be better for<br />\nher in the long run. No, Wendell<br />\nFortinbras could not let a woman,<br />\nnot even Carotene Bettelheim,<br />\nstand in the way of his goal.<br />\nThe doors slid open and he<br />\nalmost bumped into Carotene on<br />\nher way in. He turned and called<br />\nto her but she gave no notice.<br />\nHe took to the stairs, search-<br />\n<br />\ning floors until he found her among<br />\nthe stacks on B-Level. \"Carotene!\"<br />\nhe whispered fiercely.<br />\n\"Hello,\" she said absently,<br />\nstaring at books.<br />\n\"It's me Wendell.\"<br />\nShe turned to face him. Here<br />\nlook was sour.<br />\n\"We met at the party last<br />\nnight. You must remember.\"<br />\n\"Yeah. . .sort of. I was so<br />\ndrunk last night I can hardly<br />\nremember a thing.\" She returned<br />\nto the books.<br />\n\"Look, I just wanted to tell<br />\nyou I think we should stop seeing<br />\neach other immediately.\"<br />\n\"What?\"<br />\n\"I'm just not ready to make<br />\n.<br />\na commitment\"<br />\n\"What are you talking<br />\nabout?\"<br />\n\"It's for your own good. It's<br />\ngoing to hurt for awhile, but believe<br />\nme, Carotene, you'll thank me later<br />\non.<br />\n\"Oh, really? Well, I certainly<br />\nappreciate your concern, but I<br />\ndon't think you--.<br />\n\"Goodbye, Carotene.\" He<br />\nturned and left.<br />\nIt was dark out already, and<br />\na cold wind blew, but Wendell felt<br />\ngood inside. He had triumphed.<br />\nOvercome his obsession. When he<br />\ngot back to his room he would<br />\nthrow out all that poetry and settle<br />\ndown into serious study once more.<br />\nAs long as he had his goal to<br />\nachieve and that calculator at his<br />\nbelt, everything would be fine.<br />\n99<br />\n<br />\nJiete<br />\n<br />\noice4<br />\necnjtao<br />\n- 17<br />\nky<br />\nohn: Am 1 boring? I like to<br />\nthink of myself as a regular kind<br />\nof guy. But I stare into the palm<br />\nof my hand sometimes when I'm alone<br />\nfor hours wondering what all those queer<br />\nlittle lines mean. Are they a map to<br />\nhidden treasure? The meaning of my life,<br />\nabsolute, ,2ternal? Are they the pattern of<br />\nmy fate, perhaps; a destiny of great glory<br />\nand fame (a leader), or the life of the<br />\nlittle man, so full of the sweetness of<br />\nsimple pleasures, the joys of the soil,<br />\ndomestic bliss. But who's to say what is<br />\nreal and what is an allusion.<br />\n<br />\nIn my consciousness ;raising<br />\ngroup, people are always describing their<br />\ndreams. Many of them disturb me. They<br />\nare dirty and violent. I have one dream,<br />\nand I think my dream is beautiful.<br />\nIn it I am stepping out of a purling<br />\n<br />\nWcme Weditet<br />\nmountain stream, where I have just<br />\nbathed, when a lovely and dignified<br />\nwoman swirls up to me in a white gossamer robe. When I put on my glasses to<br />\nget a better view, I find that there is an<br />\nodd material, greasy like Vaseline on my<br />\nlenses. But the woman is so beautiful,<br />\nher gaze so radiant and direct, that I<br />\nforget. She stands on the mossy bank<br />\nholding two roses. She gives one to me as<br />\nI draw close, and I understand as if by<br />\nmagic that this is a gesture of friendship.<br />\nWe sit by the stream and talk of our<br />\nmutual respect for the sciences and<br />\nspiritual love\u2014the importance of mutual<br />\nrespect in a relationship. We write love<br />\nletters in the mud of the bank, and<br />\nsuddenly she is wearing jeans and a<br />\nfisherman's sweater. We splash each<br />\nother and sing \"Where Have All The<br />\n<br />\nFlowers Gone\" and other old favorites as<br />\nwe stroll hand in hand. But then my<br />\nloved one Runes to me, a little frown<br />\nplaying with her bountiful features.<br />\n\"Dear,\" she says, want you for<br />\na friend, but you're just not man enough<br />\nto be my lover.\"<br />\n\"But you're breaking rule no. 1 of<br />\nIlimsells Kindness is Kontagious Kode!\"<br />\nI say.<br />\n\"Sorry,\" she says with genuine<br />\ncompassion. \"But I won't be no ham<br />\nbovine to a manly joint such as yours!<br />\nWhy don't you try Right Place patent<br />\npending I1M12937 (see himself p. 13);<br />\nThat might up your chances a little, but<br />\nI'm not going to guarantee anything.\"<br />\nMy friends assured me that this<br />\nwas just the recurringl television dream<br />\nthat plagues all Hopkins men.

Would she feel for I<br />\nme in exactly that same special way?,Was<br />\nthis Love come to take me away on<br />\ngossamer wings? Was this an earthquake<br />\nor merely a shock? I pondered these<br />\nthings in my heart while Mary sipped her<br />\nbeer daintily through a candy striped<br />\nstraw. I wanted to...<br />\nMary: Ah Girls! I will always remember<br />\nJohn for the voluptuous sport he afforded me, shall I say the free play of the<br />\nfaculties. Was it but less fleeting! But<br />\nalas, Love, like Youth, flies with the<br />\nwings of Time's shifting sands, and<br />\nL'ennui is a snake in the lush grasses of<br />\nDesire. John was a man of contemplation<br />\nwhen first we met,his fair eyes transfixed<br />\nas if on some point far in the blue distance. Fairly a Hamlet he was,and I, his<br />\nbutterfly, Ophelia. I imagined he must be<br />\na poet, but actually he was a man- of<br />\nscience. (Though the way he scratched<br />\nhis limbs, I feared lest he had accruedthe<br />\ndropsy.) Of what thoughts he populated<br />\nthe void of his mind's cavity, I knew not,<br />\nneither did I care; I would fain speculate<br />\non the perfect volcano of smothered<br />\ndesire that surely bubbled and spewed<br />\n<br />\nforth the hot lava of d'amour beneath his<br />\ncool smooth brow.<br />\nI know the moment I set my<br />\ndewy eyes on the sleek line of his manly<br />\nform in that hive of, Love's pilgrims, the<br />\nRathskellar, that, indeed,he would desire<br />\na peek at my charming calf, and perhaps,<br />\nI hoped, at the divinity of my burnished<br />\nmarblelike thigh.<br />\nI approached, my<br />\nnerves all aquiver, to ask what o'clock it<br />\nmight be. With gentlemanly sobriety, he<br />\nconsulted his dial. Ah, the smooth<br />\ndelicacy of those fingers that might<br />\nfondle the poles of my panting white<br />\nglobes. Did he, in his flower of innocence, suspect my bold passion? No,<br />\nhe was far too absorbed in the furnishings<br />\nof his mind's chamber. It was for me to<br />\ndraw him out as one might the pearly<br />\ndroplet of honey from it's suckle. With<br />\npervasisve elequence, I drew his liquid<br />\neyes from that inward focus onto the<br />\nthreshold of my ruby lips and the purling<br />\ndepths of my fawn like eyes.<br />\nWe danced and I coultl sense the<br />\nsleeping giants of his biceps flexing,with<br />\nthe ghythm of the simple melody that the<br />\nminstrels played. My eyes made their<br />\nsweet pilgramage to what I imagined as<br />\n<br />\nthe downy concavity of his loins and, ah<br />\nbut I must quickly execute the thought<br />\nlest he think me over brazen a maid, the<br />\nseeming knot, the dart of Love,that pert<br />\nMr. Priapus, who made his dwelling in<br />\nLove's furrow there. Perhaps merely a<br />\nmodest blush would betray my rapturous<br />\nsentiments with proper poise. The music<br />\nhad become too loud for the employment<br />\nof comely forms of speech in my pursuit<br />\nof Love's fulfillment.<br />\nAnd such it was that I induced<br />\nthis reluctant Odysseus to taste of life's<br />\nrich tapestry and his body's hermit to<br />\nenter the mossy grotto between my<br />\nthighs. Alas how innocent a pupil he<br />\nwas and what trials I encountered in<br />\ntraining him to properly wield his weapon. Summarily, I would have awarded<br />\nhim an A for effort, a D for accuracy.<br />\nNevertheless, we were happy for a<br />\ntime: the pleasure of a stroll between<br />\nclasses, a warm brew at the coffee<br />\nshoppe, those evenings we read aloud- to<br />\none another until the book fell from our<br />\nblushing fingertips in a fresh onslaught of<br />\ndesire. Yet that wiley helmsman of<br />\nLove's ship desired to steer our sweet<br />\nvessel to boiling waters and rockier shores<br />\n<br />\nwhere we would encounter our separate<br />\ndestinies and drink the visceral draught of<br />\nloneliness. John said that I had set him<br />\npanning for that kernal of'genius at his<br />\nsoul's depth. He felt called upon to write<br />\npoetry, learn to pluck the guitar, and to<br />\nsearch for himself in that exotic land of<br />\nmany veils, The East. He left me to find<br />\nthat cocoa-skinned woman who would be<br />\nhis new guide toward Passion's hidden<br />\ntreasure. Shall I wait like Penelope for<br />\nmy sea-weary boy to return a man? Or<br />\ndoes not a brilliant new Apollo rise on<br />\nthe mind's horizon with every rosy dawn;<br />\nJohn: Mary taught me all I know of<br />\nsexual congress, and I love and respect<br />\nher for that. Sometimes I think we were<br />\ntoo passionate for this modern age we live<br />\nin. We made a chemical reaction with the<br />\npower of TNT. When I began tutoring<br />\nLing, a fellow bio major, in her English<br />\ngrammar it was too much for Mary, and<br />\nshe never forgave me for what she<br />\nimagined was a deep betrayal. I loved<br />\nMary, but sometines I'm glad we went<br />\nour separate ways.

They let their corn-<br /><br />\ncouldn't help but feel that they were only<br />\ninterested in my body.<br />\nI talked to my father about it. \"It<br />\nwas the same at Hopkins when I was<br />\nthere in the early fifties.

You don't have to be ashamed to<br />\nmake charges openly. The shame of<br />\nadmitting that it happens has allowed the<br />\nsystem to go unchanged.<br />\nI've heard of cases where men<br />\nhave faced the added embarrassment of<br />\nbeing told by their school's academic<br />\ncouncil that they deserved harrassment,<br />\nthat unbuttoning the top button or two<br />\nand smiling at the professor only led her<br />\non, and that it was in fact his fault.<br /><br />\nThe shame of<br />\nadmitting that it<br />\nhappens allowed<br />\nthe system to go<br />\nunchanged<br />\nThis is, to say the least, a disgrace.<br />\nNo such case has come up before the JHU<br />\nAcademic Council but when it does we<br />\nmen better by damn sure that we won't<br />\nlet the women of that council embarrass<br />\nus further.<br /><br />\nthe move toward<br />\nequality and<br />\nmutual respect<br />\nmust start now!<br />\nI have chosen the most difficult<br />\npath for my last year.

Books put<br />\non shelves will have to be taken off again.<br />\nAll this menial housework stands opposed<br />\nto the functions of your apartment,living<br />\nand studying.<br />\nSome friends ask me if this type<br />\nof apartment living isn't worrisome when<br />\nentertaining. I don't think so. Be yourself and let people see the real you, not<br />\nthe \"well-mannered\" or \"trained\" you<br />\nthat makes us all so similar, but the you<br />\nbeneath all of that. If you drink a lot of<br />\nbeer, let people know it. Don't feel you<br />\nhave to hide the empty bottles. If<br />\nyou had spaghetti last night, don't be<br />\nashamed, plenty of people eat spaghetti let the dishes rest! If you smoke a lot,let<br />\nthe ashtrays overflow; besides, you never<br />\nknow when you'll run out.<br />\nYou see, there's nothing wrong<br />\nwith being yourself and letting people see<br />\nhow you're most comfortable. The<br />\nfunction is your comfort, and the style is<br />\nyou.<br />\n\"But,\" you may ask, \"what if I<br />\nThe apartment came<br />\ncan't be me?<br />\nfurnished and doesn't express me.\" This<br />\nproblem arises frequently for the college<br />\nman. The answer is simple. The new style<br />\nis not to set guidelines or to consult rule<br />\nbooks; you don't have to put the typewriter on the typing table. You can do<br />\nwhatever you want. Just as you consider<br />\nthe layout of the apartment a \"given,\" so<br />\ntoo is the furniture that comes with it. If<br />\nyou don't like it, bury it. For this you<br />\ncan use your clothes or some old newspaper.<br />\n\"But I share a place with someone. What if ME and HIM clash.\" The<br />\nonly thing I find more invigorating than a<br />\nBach fugue is the counterpoint of two<br />\ndifferent ME styles expressed simultaneously. If your roommate can't stand<br />\nthe way you leave your things lying<br />\naround, leave his things lying around<br />\ninstead. The dichotomy of separate ME<br />\nstyles is particularly interesting when<br />\nentertaining. Newcomers to your place<br />\nwill expose their true opinions of you. If<br />\nthey think the wine glasses are yours and<br />\nthe National Boh cans your roommates',<br />\nthen let them think you have more class<br />\nthan him.

Sick of Scarsdales,<br />\nStillmans and the like? Well, your days<br />\nof frustrating fatness are over. New<br />\nstudies released by the Johns Hopkins<br />\nUniversity Center for Fat Control reveal<br />\nnew ways to peel off those pounds.<br /><br />\nAlimentary<br />\nRegurgitation<br />\nAction<br />\nScientists discovered that freshman<br />\non Hopkins' own Homewood campus<br />\nachieved drastic weight-loss after several<br />\nweeks of dorm living. Interestingly<br />\nenough, students- question reported no<br />\ndecrease of food intake. Scientists found,<br />\nupon closer observation and questioning,<br />\nthat the students were unable to keep the<br />\ncafeteria food down, and consequently,<br />\ncounld lose weight regardless of the<br />\namount of food intake. While some<br />\nstudents praise the pound-loss plan, it<br />\ndoes have some minor negative side<br />\neffects. Consult your doctor first before<br />\ntrying this diet. Persons of normal weight<br />\nor under should not attempt this plan.<br />\n41 *<br /><br />\n*<br /><br />\n4. *\u2022*<br /><br />\n*<br /><br />\n*<br /><br />\nThe Robert0.<br />\nCoca-Cola Diet<br />\nThis plan offers a safe, easy method<br />\nfor dispairing dieters. It includes only<br />\none meal a day, to be ingested at whatever time and to consist of as much food<br />\nas the dieter can cram into his or her<br />\nmouth. Fast food franchises provide the<br />\nideal quickness, quantity, and quality<br />\nneeded although any food will do. At<br />\nany other time of the day or night, the<br />\ndiet may be supplemented with CocaCola only. The corbonation in this drink<br />\nhas the effect of filling you with gas so<br />\nthat you feel full, while the caffeine<br />\nspeeds up you metabolism and burns off<br />\nthose nasty calories. One satisfied dieter<br />\nsuggests that you keep a hip flask with<br />\nyou at all times and have a two-liter<br />\nbottle by your bed at night to curb those<br />\nmidnight urges to munch.<br /><br />\nthe Twinkies behind the radiator, hide<br />\nthe M&amp;M's in your dirty socks, push the<br />\npizza under your bed, or conceal the<br />\ncookies under your couch cusions.<br />\nJudicious placement of old newspapers,<br />\ndirty laundry and various uncleansed<br /><br />\nkitchen utensils also create handy hiding<br />\nplaces. The added advantage of this<br />\nmethod is that if you ever find the food<br />\nagain, it will be so nauseating as the<br />\ndispel _my pangs of hunger for a good 24<br />\nhours.<br /><br />\n* Have you been studying too efficiently?<br />\n* Haven't had to pull an all-nighter in weeks?<br />\n* Are you being ostracized by your B-level buddies?<br />\nNot to worry!

He could<br />\ndrive, had<br />\njust imagine all the admissions<br />\ndirectors of the East Coast's finest<br />\nmedical schools clamoring over<br />\nwhich of them would get the honor<br />\nof accepting him, Wendell Fortinbras, into their hallowed academy.<br />\nThe thought made him beam with<br />\nhappiness and he carried himself<br />\nthrough the quad like a prince.<br />\nUpstairs in his single, Wendell<br />\ntook a seat at this desk beneath the<br />\nwindow and began puttering with<br />\nhis calculator, occasionally gazing<br />\nout over the quad while waiting for<br />\ntrig functions to register. After<br />\nsolving a particularly difficult sinewave problem (of his own device),<br />\nhe happened to glance outside and<br />\ncatch a glimpse of Carolene Bettelheim as she crossed over to the<br />\ncafeteria. His glasses slipped off his<br />\nface.<br />\nWendell was in love with<br />\nCarolene Bettelheim: hopelessly,<br />\ndesperately in love, for she was<br />\ntotally unaware of his existence.<br />\nHe had tracked her down in the<br />\nFreshman Register and the Student<br />\nDirectory, knew everything about<br />\nher. She was an I.R. major from<br />\nDarien, Connecticut whose wardrobe consisted almost entirely of<br />\nsweaters, jeans and gym outfits<br />\nthat seemed to take on lives their<br />\nown when she wore them. Her<br />\nfigure was a marvel of geometry,<br />\na flawless juxtaposition of bellcurves and apexes that could cause<br />\neven the staunchest Quaker to start<br />\nacting like Mighty Joe Young.<br />\nWendell worshipped her. He had<br />\neven written poems dedicated to<br />\nher, and now he pulled one out at<br />\nrandom from a sheaf of papers on<br />\nhis desk and examined it:<br /><br />\n9tElfinzan SVo.i9<br />\nWatzEn<br /><br />\nsnickered and nudged the guy<br />\nsitting next to him, a football<br />\nplayer, by mistake.

I'll come past about<br />\nnine, then. Can I have that if<br />\n\"Come on Wendell, have you're not eating it?\"<br />\nsome fun. It's only a party.

She looked<br />\nravishing, as usual, but now she had<br />\na funny sort of gleam in her eye,<br />\nand she was softly pursing and<br />\nunpursing her lips. Looking right at<br />\nhim! He could barely stand still.<br />\nAnd now (could it be?) she was<br />\ntaking a step in his direction!<br /><br />\nOrchestras boomed in Wendell's<br />\nhead. \"Oh, sweet mystery of life...\"<br />\nShe broke away from the<br />\nbunch and approached him, a<br />\nhalf-empty beer in her hand.<br />\n\"You're dribbling,\" she said.<br />\n\"Wh-what?\" He had crunched<br />\na piece of ice between his teeth and<br />\nnow it was leaking all over his chin.<br />\n\"Let me clean you up.\" The<br />\ngirls were laughing louder, but<br />\nWendell paid no attention. He was<br />\nstaring down deep into Carolene's<br />\nchocolatey brown eyes. She led<br />\nhim to a table where she took a<br />\nnapkin and began wiping his face.<br />\n\"What's your name?\" she asked.<br />\n\"Wendell.\"<br />\n\"I love it.\"<br />\n\"You do?\"<br />\n\"Sure.

Could this<br />\nreally be happening?\"W-want rue?\"<br />\n\"Yes,\" she hissed seductively. \"Now.\" The breeze blew her<br />\nhair back in silky waves. She<br />\nmoistened her lips with her tongue.<br />\n\"Let's go.\"<br />\nHis heart pounded like a<br />\npiston.

Wendell Fortinbras,<br />\npre-med, had taken advantage of a<br />\ngirl! Led her'on! \"You cad!\" he<br />\nshouted. \"How could you!\" No,<br />\nshe wasn't an untouchable freshman love goddess, she was just. . .a<br />\ngirl. A poor infatuated girl. And<br />\nnow another, more haunting<br />\nthought hit him: had he completely<br />\nruined his chances for a brilliant<br />\ncareer in private practice?<br />\nGuilt plagued him throughout the day. By dinnertime he<br />\ncould stand it no longer and he<br />\nburst out of the D-Level carrels in a<br />\nsweat, mumbling incoherently.<br />\nIt's not worth it, he told<br />\nhimself in the elevator up to the<br />\nmain floor of the library. Love<br />\nsimply must take a back seat to<br />\nstudy, there was no getting around<br />\nit. He would have to tell Carotene<br />\nright away, before she started<br />\ngetting serious. Sure, she would<br />\nbe hurt, but it would be better for<br />\nher in the long run. No, Wendell<br />\nFortinbras could not let a woman,<br />\nnot even Carotene Bettelheim,<br />\nstand in the way of his goal.<br />\nThe doors slid open and he<br />\nalmost bumped into Carotene on<br />\nher way in. He turned and called<br />\nto her but she gave no notice.<br />\nHe took to the stairs, search-<br /><br />\ning floors until he found her among<br />\nthe stacks on B-Level. \"Carotene!\"<br />\nhe whispered fiercely.<br />\n\"Hello,\" she said absently,<br />\nstaring at books.<br />\n\"It's me Wendell.\"<br />\nShe turned to face him. Here<br />\nlook was sour.<br />\n\"We met at the party last<br />\nnight. You must remember.\"<br />\n\"Yeah. . .sort of. I was so<br />\ndrunk last night I can hardly<br />\nremember a thing.\" She returned<br />\nto the books.<br />\n\"Look, I just wanted to tell<br />\nyou I think we should stop seeing<br />\neach other immediately.\"<br />\n\"What?\"<br />\n\"I'm just not ready to make<br />\n.<br />\na commitment\"<br />\n\"What are you talking<br />\nabout?\"<br />\n\"It's for your own good.

Well, I certainly<br />\nappreciate your concern, but I<br />\ndon't think you--.<br />\n\"Goodbye, Carotene.\" He<br />\nturned and left.<br />\nIt was dark out already, and<br />\na cold wind blew, but Wendell felt<br />\ngood inside. He had triumphed.<br />\nOvercome his obsession. When he<br />\ngot back to his room he would<br />\nthrow out all that poetry and settle<br />\ndown into serious study once more.<br />\nAs long as he had his goal to<br />\nachieve and that calculator at his<br />\nbelt, everything would be fine.<br />\n99<br /><br />\nJiete<br /><br />\noice4<br />\necnjtao<br />\n- 17<br />\nky<br />\nohn: Am 1 boring? I like to<br />\nthink of myself as a regular kind<br />\nof guy.

The meaning of my life,<br />\nabsolute, ,2ternal?

But who's to say what is<br />\nreal and what is an allusion.<br /><br />\nIn my consciousness ;raising<br />\ngroup, people are always describing their<br />\ndreams. Many of them disturb me.

When I put on my glasses to<br />\nget a better view, I find that there is an<br />\nodd material, greasy like Vaseline on my<br />\nlenses. But the woman is so beautiful,<br />\nher gaze so radiant and direct, that I<br />\nforget. She stands on the mossy bank<br />\nholding two roses. She gives one to me as<br />\nI draw close, and I understand as if by<br />\nmagic that this is a gesture of friendship.<br />\nWe sit by the stream and talk of our<br />\nmutual respect for the sciences and<br />\nspiritual love\u2014the importance of mutual<br />\nrespect in a relationship. We write love<br />\nletters in the mud of the bank, and<br />\nsuddenly she is wearing jeans and a<br />\nfisherman's sweater. We splash each<br />\nother and sing \"Where Have All The<br /><br />\nFlowers Gone\" and other old favorites as<br />\nwe stroll hand in hand. But then my<br />\nloved one Runes to me, a little frown<br />\nplaying with her bountiful features.<br />\n\"Dear,\" she says, want you for<br />\na friend, but you're just not man enough<br />\nto be my lover.\"<br />\n\"But you're breaking rule no. 1 of<br />\nIlimsells Kindness is Kontagious Kode!\"<br />\nI say.<br />\n\"Sorry,\" she says with genuine<br />\ncompassion. \"But I won't be no ham<br />\nbovine to a manly joint such as yours!<br />\nWhy don't you try Right Place patent<br />\npending I1M12937 (see himself p. 13);<br />\nThat might up your chances a little, but<br />\nI'm not going to guarantee anything.\"<br />\nMy friends assured me that this<br />\nwas just the recurringl television dream<br />\nthat plagues all Hopkins men.

Would she feel for I<br />\nme in exactly that same special way?,Was<br />\nthis Love come to take me away on<br />\ngossamer wings? Was this an earthquake<br />\nor merely a shock? I pondered these<br />\nthings in my heart while Mary sipped her<br />\nbeer daintily through a candy striped<br />\nstraw. I wanted to...<br />\nMary: Ah Girls! I will always remember<br />\nJohn for the voluptuous sport he afforded me, shall I say the free play of the<br />\nfaculties. Was it but less fleeting! But<br />\nalas, Love, like Youth, flies with the<br />\nwings of Time's shifting sands, and<br />\nL'ennui is a snake in the lush grasses of<br />\nDesire. John was a man of contemplation<br />\nwhen first we met,his fair eyes transfixed<br />\nas if on some point far in the blue distance. Fairly a Hamlet he was,and I, his<br />\nbutterfly, Ophelia. I imagined he must be<br />\na poet, but actually he was a man- of<br />\nscience. (Though the way he scratched<br />\nhis limbs, I feared lest he had accruedthe<br />\ndropsy.) Of what thoughts he populated<br />\nthe void of his mind's cavity, I knew not,<br />\nneither did I care; I would fain speculate<br />\non the perfect volcano of smothered<br />\ndesire that surely bubbled and spewed<br /><br />\nforth the hot lava of d'amour beneath his<br />\ncool smooth brow.<br />\nI know the moment I set my<br />\ndewy eyes on the sleek line of his manly<br />\nform in that hive of, Love's pilgrims, the<br />\nRathskellar, that, indeed,he would desire<br />\na peek at my charming calf, and perhaps,<br />\nI hoped, at the divinity of my burnished<br />\nmarblelike thigh.<br />\nI approached, my<br />\nnerves all aquiver, to ask what o'clock it<br />\nmight be. With gentlemanly sobriety, he<br />\nconsulted his dial. Ah, the smooth<br />\ndelicacy of those fingers that might<br />\nfondle the poles of my panting white<br />\nglobes. Did he, in his flower of innocence, suspect my bold passion? No,<br />\nhe was far too absorbed in the furnishings<br />\nof his mind's chamber. It was for me to<br />\ndraw him out as one might the pearly<br />\ndroplet of honey from it's suckle. With<br />\npervasisve elequence, I drew his liquid<br />\neyes from that inward focus onto the<br />\nthreshold of my ruby lips and the purling<br />\ndepths of my fawn like eyes.<br />\nWe danced and I coultl sense the<br />\nsleeping giants of his biceps flexing,with<br />\nthe ghythm of the simple melody that the<br />\nminstrels played. My eyes made their<br />\nsweet pilgramage to what I imagined as<br /><br />\nthe downy concavity of his loins and, ah<br />\nbut I must quickly execute the thought<br />\nlest he think me over brazen a maid, the<br />\nseeming knot, the dart of Love,that pert<br />\nMr. Priapus, who made his dwelling in<br />\nLove's furrow there. Perhaps merely a<br />\nmodest blush would betray my rapturous<br />\nsentiments with proper poise. The music<br />\nhad become too loud for the employment<br />\nof comely forms of speech in my pursuit<br />\nof Love's fulfillment.<br />\nAnd such it was that I induced<br />\nthis reluctant Odysseus to taste of life's<br />\nrich tapestry and his body's hermit to<br />\nenter the mossy grotto between my<br />\nthighs. Alas how innocent a pupil he<br />\nwas and what trials I encountered in<br />\ntraining him to properly wield his weapon. Summarily, I would have awarded<br />\nhim an A for effort, a D for accuracy.<br />\nNevertheless, we were happy for a<br />\ntime: the pleasure of a stroll between<br />\nclasses, a warm brew at the coffee<br />\nshoppe, those evenings we read aloud- to<br />\none another until the book fell from our<br />\nblushing fingertips in a fresh onslaught of<br />\ndesire. Yet that wiley helmsman of<br />\nLove's ship desired to steer our sweet<br />\nvessel to boiling waters and rockier shores<br /><br />\nwhere we would encounter our separate<br />\ndestinies and drink the visceral draught of<br />\nloneliness. John said that I had set him<br />\npanning for that kernal of'genius at his<br />\nsoul's depth. He felt called upon to write<br />\npoetry, learn to pluck the guitar, and to<br />\nsearch for himself in that exotic land of<br />\nmany veils, The East. He left me to find<br />\nthat cocoa-skinned woman who would be<br />\nhis new guide toward Passion's hidden<br />\ntreasure. Shall I wait like Penelope for<br />\nmy sea-weary boy to return a man? Or<br />\ndoes not a brilliant new Apollo rise on<br />\nthe mind's horizon with every rosy dawn;<br />\nJohn: Mary taught me all I know of<br />\nsexual congress, and I love and respect<br />\nher for that.

When I began tutoring<br />\nLing, a fellow bio major, in her English<br />\ngrammar it was too much for Mary, and<br />\nshe never forgave me for what she<br />\nimagined was a deep betrayal.

Nevertheless, in<br />\nthe interests of equal time (and, for this<br />\nfinal N-L of the semester, sufficient copy)<br />\nI thought I'd sound off about some of the<br />\nissues of the day.<br />\n1) I was most distressed to read of<br />\nTheonia Charles' horribly undernourishing intellectual experience in the<br />\nRathskellar.
