Bentsen, a Democrat<br />\nfrom Texas dealt with a variety<br />\nof topics concerning the office of<br />\nthe President in his half hour<br />\ntalk. Included were the<br />\nPresident's role as a politician,<br />\nparty head, Commander in Chief,<br />\nand Chief Executive. Bentsen<br />\nalso touched upon such issues as<br />\n<br />\nthe decline of Congressional<br />\npower, the right of the public to<br />\nregister its opinion, and<br />\nimpeachment.<br />\n\"A President is required to be<br />\nmany things to millions of<br />\npeople. Above all, I think he<br />\nshould be a politician...able to<br />\ntranslate public opinion into<br />\naction,\" stated Bentsen.<br />\nHe also noted that since \"a<br />\nPresident can't conduct his<br />\nbusiness within a vacuum,\" the<br />\nability to work with both<br />\npolitical parties is essential.<br />\nAmong his other observations,<br />\nBentsen asserted that \"I see the<br />\nPresident as an analyst of<br />\nlegislation. He should execute.<br />\n<br />\nlaws, not kill them.\" He stressed<br />\nthe point that while the President<br />\nis free to offer legislation of his<br />\nown, he should not contradict<br />\nCongress. \u2022<br />\nHe also emphasized that a<br />\ngood President can delegate his<br />\nauthority to responsible<br />\nsubordinates. Bentsen stated that<br />\n\"the Chief Executive is not the<br />\nsole executive\" and urged that a<br />\nstrong Cabinet be placed above<br />\nany \"small White House clique.\"<br />\nFurthermore, he noted that \"it's<br />\nan unwise President who<br />\nbypasses his Cabinet\" and that a<br />\nPresident can be judged by the<br />\ntype of people he delegates<br />\nauthority to.<br />\n<br />\nVerdict pending on coed dorms<br />\nBy SUE EYRICH<br />\nIn approximately ten days, the<br />\nUniversity will decide whether or<br />\nnot to expand coeducational<br />\nHousing on campus for next<br />\nyear.<br />\nThe principal factors involved<br />\nin the decision will be the<br />\nnumber of female applicants that<br />\naccept their admission offers, and<br />\nthe number of next year's<br />\nFreshman who indicate a desire<br />\nfor coed housing, Peter Heist,<br />\nUniversity Housing Director,<br />\nrevealed yesterday.<br />\n\"The University is committed<br />\nto coed dorms and hopes to<br />\nexpand the existing facilities,\"<br />\nsaid Heist.<br />\nTwo of the suggested houses<br />\nfor conversion are Jennings<br />\nHouse in the new dorm complex<br />\nand the joint Vincent-Willard<br />\n<br />\nHouse in the old dorm complex.<br />\nHeist pointed out that he<br />\nthought the complaint of many<br />\nold dorm residents that they<br />\ndeserved coeducational housing<br />\nas much as new dorm residents<br />\nwas \"a valid one.\"<br />\nJennings was suggested for<br />\nconversion because of its<br />\nproximity to Lazear, presently<br />\nHopkins' only coed dormitory. If<br />\nJennings is selected a new<br />\nhousemaster plan would<br />\nprobably be implemented,<br />\naccording to Heist, whereby the<br />\nhousemasters of both Jennings<br />\nand Lazear would share the<br />\nresponsibility for the dorms.<br />\nLast year when an<br />\nunprecedented number of girls<br />\nopted for dormitory housing, the<br />\nHousing Office found itself in a<br />\ndifficult satiation, Heist stated.<br />\n<br />\nBentsen spent much of his talk<br />\ndiscussing the decline of<br />\nCongressional power. Fixing as<br />\nmuch blame on Congress as on<br />\nthe executive branch, he said that<br />\nthere is \"too much spotlight on<br />\nthe White House.\" Even though<br />\nhe feels that most people favor a<br />\nstrong President, he expressed a<br />\ndesire for greater Congressional<br />\nauthority in the future.<br />\nPresident and Public<br />\nAnother topic Bentsen<br />\nconsidered was the President's<br />\nrelation with the public. Urging a<br />\nmore candid attitude on the part<br />\nof the President, he deplored the<br />\ninacessibilify of the Chief<br />\nExecutive.<br />\nHe proposed more frequent<br />\npress conferences in order to<br />\nincrease the President's<br />\naccountability to the public.<br />\n<br />\nAlger Hiss to speak<br />\nat Whitehill Lecture<br />\n<br />\nAuk<br />\nDean Fitzpatrick<br />\nThere was not a sufficient<br />\nnumber to fill a new house or so<br />\nsmall a group as to be placed in<br />\nthe already existing female<br />\nhouses. Hopkins then attempted<br />\ncoeducation by converting<br />\nLazear House.<br />\nDean of Students Robert<br />\nFitzpatrick noted, \"Hopkins<br />\nwent into it out of necessity. But<br />\nthe response,\" he continued,<br />\n\"was so favorable that it seems<br />\nadvisable to have as much as<br />\npossible.\"<br />\n\"If and when, we find the<br />\nmoney for complete renovation<br />\nof the dormitories into suite<br />\naccomodations, I would like to<br />\nsee men and women in adjoining<br />\nsuites throughout the entire<br />\ndorm complex.

Towards<br />\nthat end, I plan to do my best to<br />\nfamiliarize myself with the status<br />\nof undergrads at the medical<br />\ninstitutions of East Baltimore,<br />\nand SAIS. I will try to bring<br />\nabout a greater utilization of<br />\nexisting university resources by<br />\nundergraduates and will pay<br />\nattention and will work for the<br />\ncontinual improvement of the<br />\nUniversity's faculty and facilities,<br />\nN-L: Do you see your role as<br />\none of undergraduate<br />\nrepresentative or as trustee of the<br />\nvested in te rests of the<br />\nUniversity?<br />\nHoffman: That's a shitty<br />\nquestion. That implies that the<br />\ninterests are mutually exclusive,<br />\nand I don't believe that they are.<br />\nN-L: If so, then why the need<br />\nspecifically for four Young<br />\nTrustees?<br />\nHoffman: Good question. I<br />\nbelieve the purpose of the Young<br />\nTrustee is to bring the Board the<br />\nperspective of a person primarily<br />\neffected by the University but<br />\nwho has otherwise little affect on<br />\nthe University.<br />\nN-L: Do you think the<br />\nposition was originally instituted<br />\nto placate discontented<br />\nundergraduates?<br />\nHoffman: If it was, and if we<br />\nhave been placated, then I believe<br />\nthe results of the Creation of this<br />\nposition have only been<br />\nconstructive.<br />\n<br />\nspecifically with the status of<br />\nacademics at Hopkins. In the Fall<br />\nof 1974, I will work to see to it<br />\nthat undergraduate reps of the<br />\nHomewood campus are given the<br />\nopportunity to make a 'State of<br />\nthe University' presentation at<br />\nthe Fall meeting. This will make<br />\nthe first opportunity for<br />\nundergraduates to imform and<br />\ninteract with the entire Board of<br />\nTrustees. There are four young<br />\nTrustees. There are about fifty<br />\nTrustees. It is vital that<br />\ncommunication exist between all<br />\nmembers of the Board and the<br />\nentire University.<br />\nN-L: Fine, but many of the<br />\ncandidates also have said that<br />\nthere really is no power in the<br />\nBoard \u2014 that it's just a rubber<br />\nstamp for the president which.<br />\nadmittedly they did select. Do<br />\nyou think that as one of fifty,<br />\nyou'll be able to accomplish<br />\nanything substantive whatsoever?<br />\nHoffman: Let's assume for a<br />\nminute, that the Board is nothing<br />\nmore than a rubber stamp for the<br />\nPresident. It becomes vital then<br />\nfor the members of the Board to<br />\nreflect an awareness of student<br />\nconcerns on matters which the<br />\nPresident brings to the Board. An<br />\nactive student body accompanied<br />\nby an educated Board of<br />\nTrustees, will make it difficult<br />\nfor the President to bring any<br />\nproposal to the Board without<br />\nfirst providing a complete and<br />\nreasonable explanation for his<br />\nplans. Notice that while I did say<br />\ncomplete and reasonable, I did<br />\nnot say desireable. Tuition<br />\nincreases are not desireable. The<br />\nburden of proof lies with the<br />\nPresident and the Administration<br />\nin cases such as these to justify to<br />\nboth the Hopkins Community<br />\nand the Board of Trustees such<br />\nactions.<br />\n<br />\nN- L: Would you care to<br />\nexpand on that?<br />\nHoffman: Even if the creation<br />\nof the position was only meant as<br />\na token to buy off the protestors<br />\nof the late sixties and early<br />\nseventies, it has still brought to<br />\nboth the Board and the student<br />\nbody a kind of interaction and<br />\nconcern that was previously<br />\nnon-existent. A good liberal<br />\nwould paraphrase that by saying:<br />\n\"as long as people are talking,<br />\nthere's hope.\"<br />\n<br />\nN-L: Still, do you think the<br />\nBoard is a rubber stamp for the<br />\nPresident?<br />\nHoffman: A vote against the<br />\nPresident or one of his major<br />\nrecommendations would seem to<br />\nme comparable to a vote of 'no<br />\nconfidence' in any political<br />\nstructure. The honesty and<br />\ncandor which I have received on<br />\nevery occasion in dealing with<br />\nPresident Muller makes me<br />\ncompletely confident that every<br />\nproposal he brings to the Board<br />\nof Trustees will be one that he<br />\nfeels is best for the Johns<br />\nHopkins University.<br />\n<br />\nN-L: Still, many of the Young<br />\nTrustees candidates complained<br />\nthat the existing Young Trustees'<br />\nhave had pitifully little<br />\ncom,munication with the<br />\nundergraduates once they've left<br />\ncampus. Do you still maintain<br />\nthat there has been interaction<br />\nbetween the two groups and<br />\nwhat do you plan to do to keep<br />\nof communication open, if<br />\nanything?<br />\nHoffman: In the past year, the<br />\nundergraduates through the<br />\nstudent Council have made two<br />\npresentations to the Board of<br />\nTrustees. \u00b0lie dealing with the<br />\nstatus of Undergraduate life in<br />\ngeneral. the other dealing<br />\n<br />\nN-L: Do you feel that there is<br />\nanything you can do to<br />\nrealistically help the<br />\nundergraduate with such problems<br />\nas housing, or more impOrtantly<br />\nimminent tuition hikes?<br />\nHoffman: On housing, yes. On<br />\ntuition hikes, no. I should like to<br />\nemphasize, that whatever<br />\nimprovements come about in<br />\nhousing, they will come about as<br />\na result of my interacions with<br />\npeople in the University,<br />\nparticularly the Dean of Students<br />\nOffice and the Housing Office. I<br />\ndo not feel that Undergraduate<br />\nhousing is a priority of<br />\nUndergraduate concerns to be<br />\nbrought to the Board of Trustees.<br />\n<br />\nWith regards to tuition, it will<br />\ntake the best brains of our<br />\ncountry to undo the damage<br />\nwhich Richard Nixon has<br />\nmanaged to bring about since<br />\n1968. I foresee continued hikes<br />\nin tuition. I pledge myself to<br />\nworking for convincing the Board<br />\nof Trustees that increased money<br />\nfor student, aid must be found.<br />\nI'm nor the first, and I won't be<br />\nthe last to work for this. I'll try. I<br />\nhope something can be done.<br />\nN-L: Do you think that the<br />\nBoard can have a significant<br />\ninput into academics here,<br />\nsomething you were very<br />\nconcerned with as an undergrad.<br />\nIsn't the AC pretty much the<br />\nfinal word on Academics?<br />\nHoffman: The Board should<br />\nnot and can not play a role in<br />\ndetermining the nature of<br />\nAcademics at Hopkins. I would<br />\nonly hope that the Board would<br />\nconcur in my belief that the<br />\nfaculty should be committed to<br />\nserving the entire community. I<br />\nfirmly believe in Milton S.<br />\nEisenhower's guideline of one<br />\nman, one course at the<br />\nUniversity, and I will work<br />\ntowards this end.<br />\nN-L: Does the nature of the<br />\ncomposition of the Board bother<br />\nyou, that it is, generally very<br />\nwealthy, nearly all male?<br />\nHoffman: Well let's assume<br />\nthat it does bother me. I'm open<br />\nto suggestions.<br />\nN-L: Do you believe, that a<br />\nwoman should perhaps, have<br />\nbeen selected as a Young Trustee<br />\neither this year, or last year, as<br />\none suggeston?<br />\nHoffman: I'll give you an<br />\nanswer that any self-respecting<br />\nradical would call a cop-out. The<br />\nperson who the Board believes<br />\nthe most concerned and<br />\ncommitted to improving the<br />\nquality of the Johns Hopkins<br />\nUniversity, ought to be chosen as<br />\nYoung Trustee. The decision<br />\nshould be made without regard<br />\nto race, religion, national origin,<br />\nor sex. But things don't always<br />\nhappen the way they should. I<br />\nbelieve that the perspective<br />\nbrought to the Board by a<br />\nwoman, a blatk or any minority<br />\ngroup student, would provide a<br />\nvaluable learning experience to<br />\nthe entire Board. Without<br />\nmeaning to sound conceited, I'm<br />\nglad that learning experience was<br />\npostponed for at least one year.<br />\nN-L: Do you think that your<br />\nbeing male either hindered or<br />\nhelped you in being selected?<br />\nHoffman: Yes.<br />\nN-L: Which one?<br />\nHoffman: Both.<br />\nN-L: That's another cop-out<br />\nisn't it?<br />\nHoffman: Yes it is. I don't<br />\nwant to try and second guess the<br />\ncommittee. I'm afraid that<br />\ntomorrow I might wake up and<br />\nfind that this has all been a<br />\ndream.<br />\nThe selections committee was<br />\nall male. I think in reverse<br />\ncircumstances, I would have felt<br />\nuneasy, had it been all women. I<br />\n<br />\nShep Hoffman<br />\nhas gotten this far with me, I'd<br />\nhelped<br />\nprobably<br />\nit<br />\nthat<br />\nbelieve<br />\nme. I also believe that while like to say...Thanks. I've met a<br />\nliberalism dictates that we go out lot of people, but I've missed<br />\neven more. I hope that I can<br />\nof our way to recognize the<br />\nhistory of oppression against continue to serve the Hopkins<br />\ncommunity, and particularly the<br />\nminority groups, that there also<br />\nHopkins Undergraduates. Finally,<br />\ntends to be a backlash to this<br />\nI'd like to emphasize that<br />\nmanner of handling appointed<br />\nHopkins is an important part of<br />\npositions. This backlash is not in<br />\nall of our lives; but there's a city,<br />\nthe form of a prejudice, rather it<br />\nmakes people hyper-sensitive to<br />\na country, and a world of people<br />\njudge things as objectively as that must remain in the forefront<br />\npossible, leaving qualifications by<br />\nof our thoughts and actions at all<br />\nrace, religion etc. but according times.

Perfunctorily dismissed<br />\nby the White House, they include<br />\nsubversion of the Bill of Rights<br />\n(illegal wiretaps, burglaries,<br />\npolitical sabotage in<br />\nelectioneering); usurpation of the<br />\nCongressional power to declare war<br />\n(secret bombing of Cambodia);<br />\nobstruction of justice (Watergate<br />\nand the firing of Archibald Cox);<br />\nillegal impoundment of over $40<br />\nbillion in Congressionally<br />\nauthorized funds; and the creation<br />\nof a special extralegal secret police<br />\nunit directly subordinate to the<br />\nWhite House.<br />\nWhether these charges are true<br />\nor not can ultimately only be<br />\ndetermined in a trial where all the<br />\ndesired evidence is made available.<br />\nThis condition is arrived at by a<br />\nmajority of the House of<br />\nRepresentatives voting to charge<br />\nthe President with \"high crimes<br />\nand misdemeanors\" and thereby<br />\nimpeaching him. Subsequently the<br />\naccused is tried before the Senate,<br />\nwhere a two-thirds vote is<br />\nnecessary for conviction and<br />\nconsequent disqualification from<br />\noffice.

Whatever<br />\nthe result, we will not know until<br />\nthe trial occurs, which makes<br />\nimpeachment all the more<br />\nnecessary.<br />\nMany Americans, however, fear<br />\nthat the President's fighting spirit<br />\nwill drag the trial on for months,<br />\nvirtually paralyzing the<br />\ngovernment. This concern was<br />\n<br />\nrecently voiced by Congressman<br />\nJames Buckley, a staunch<br />\nconservative and loyal Republican,<br />\nwhen he abruptly called for<br />\nNixon's resignation as the only<br />\nsatisfactory and dignified solution<br />\nto this \"crisis of the regime.\"<br />\nUnfortunately, Nixon himself has<br />\npresently blocked this path by<br />\npublicly proclaiming that he will<br />\n\"not resign.\" Thus, impeachment<br />\nnot only seems to be necessary, it<br />\nalso appears to be inevitable.<br />\nIn the tangle of construction<br />\nplanks at Thomas Circle in<br />\nWashington, D.C., one's attention<br />\nis caught by some of the bright<br />\ncolors in the area: a profusion of<br />\nflaming-red . posters screaming<br />\n\"March To Impeach Nixon'- April<br />\n27!\" Half a block away, at 1404 M<br />\nStreet, the second floor of an old<br />\nbrick house had been converted<br />\ninto the headquarters of the<br />\nNational Campaign to Impeach<br />\nNixon. An organization without<br />\nany titled officers, the<br />\nquasi-director is a quiet- young<br />\nlawyer-type, Ted Glick, who has<br />\nbeen active in people's campaigns<br />\nfor over six years.<br />\nGlick acknowledged that there<br />\nare two groups pushing for<br />\nimpeachment. The first group is<br />\nprimarily concerned with<br />\n\"resolving the leadership crisis.\"<br />\nThis position is mainly held by<br />\nconservatives and Republicans.<br />\nWhether Nixon remains in office is<br />\nnot the prime concern here,<br />\nalthough it is generally assumed he<br />\nwill vindicate himself.<br />\nThe second group is not quite so<br />\ndelicate in their stance.

If each of the languages<br />\nis kept separate, no problems arise.<br />\nBut, if one person mixes words<br />\nfrom both languages, a child will<br />\nnot know when each language is<br />\nappropriate, and will quickly<br />\nbecome confused.<br />\nIt seems to me that the same is<br />\ntrue in many other areas of human<br />\nbehavior. We must have clear<br />\nexamples to follow. Double<br />\nstandards confuse our reaction<br />\npatterns. We are all familiar with<br />\nthe double standard of death;<br />\nkilling is alright in war, and in<br />\npunishment for certain crimes, but<br />\nit is not allowed under God.<br />\nA similar dichotomy in policy is<br />\napparent today in terms of<br />\ndiscrimination. It seems that some<br />\ngroups (medical schools) are<br />\nallowed to discriminate in certain<br />\nareas in which other groups are not<br />\nallowed to discriminate.<br />\nAs I leafed through a medical<br />\nschool catalogue I noticed the<br />\nfollowing sentence: \"While some<br />\npreferance is given to members of<br />\nthe Seventh-day Adventist church,<br />\nit is a firm policy of the<br />\nAdmissions Committee that a<br />\nnumber of non-church related<br />\napplicants be admitted each year.\"<br />\nAnd in another catalogue,<br />\n\"Preference is given to members of<br />\ndisadvantaged minority<br />\ngroups...women applicants have a<br />\nslight advantage.\"<br />\nIf the medical schools were<br />\nrestaurants, these quotes would<br />\nnot be on the walls. Yet to our<br />\nintuition it would seem reasonable<br />\nthat if a medical school were<br />\nstarted by Indians (so that there<br />\nwould be more Indian doctors)<br />\nthat that medical school should<br />\nhave the right to admit a high<br />\npercentage of Indians. But it<br />\ndoesn't sound reasonable if a<br />\nstudent is rejected from a public<br />\nschool in order to admit a less<br />\nqualified minority student.<br />\nOf course, I realize that<br />\ndiscrimination can have good<br />\neffects. Favored minority medical<br />\nstudents may tend to practice<br />\nmore in poverty areas. It is also<br />\ntrue that for certain crimes,<br />\npositive arguments can be created.<br />\nDoes this justify them?<br />\nWe must fine a precise answer to<br />\nthe question of discrimination.<br />\nThis answer must pertain to all<br />\nlevels of society, or the result will<br />\nbe a perpetuation of our present<br />\nconfusion toward discrimination.

When the dust finally<br />\nsettled, Hopkins added a 17-4<br />\ntrophy to their current string of<br />\neight straight wins.<br />\nFreshman Richie Hirsch<br />\nscalped the Cadets with three<br />\ngoals in the second quarter to<br />\nlead the Blue Jay surge to a 6-1<br />\nadvantage.

Army's defense was<br />\ntroublesome all afternoon, but<br />\ntheir attack was too short on<br />\ntalent to capitalize on several<br />\ndecent opportunities.<br />\nWhen asked how he could get<br />\nthe Blue Jays starteds faster,<br />\nCoach Bob Scott replied. \"If I<br />\ncould do that I'd be a genius.\" In<br />\npast years Scott has been accused<br />\nof just that.

Both runners advanced<br />\non a pass ball by pitcher Dave<br />\nNovak. Mike Bogdan grounded<br />\nout, bringing home a run, and<br />\nBilly Jones singled to tie the<br />\nscore at 2-2.<br />\nIn the fifth, Hopkins took the<br />\nlead when they rallied with two<br />\nouts. Bob Babb, Tony Pucillo<br />\nand Tom Pedroni all drew bases<br />\non balls with two down, before<br />\nLou Podrazik ripped a single<br />\ndriving home Babb and Pucillo.<br />\nHopkins was never behind again.<br />\nWashington College tied it up<br />\n<br />\nin the top of the sixth but the<br />\nBlue Jays came right back in the<br />\nbottom of the sixth scoring four<br />\nruns to put the game out of reach<br />\nfor the visitors.<br />\nLeading off the sixth, Tony<br />\nPucillo smashed a triple to<br />\nleft-center. Pedroni then drove a<br />\nball to center scoring Pucillo.<br />\nPodrazik, Bukowski and Bogdan<br />\nhit consecutive singles to drive<br />\nhome two more tallies. Jim<br />\nDuffy connected on a Novak<br />\npitch for a two base hit scoring<br />\nthe fourth run of the inning.<br />\nComing in for Evans in the top<br />\n<br />\nof the seventh, Ron Brown was<br />\nwild walking three batters in<br />\nboth the seventh and eighth<br />\nframes before buckling down to<br />\nget the final out. Brown struck<br />\nout Kerry Crocken on a 3-2 pitch<br />\nending the seventh and stopping<br />\nthat rally. Brown also picked off<br />\nPhil Repucci with the bases<br />\nloaded in the eighth with two<br />\ndown to stifle another<br />\nWashington College rally.<br />\nStar of the Day<br />\nHopkins added a final run in<br />\nthe eighth after two men were<br />\nout.

After an<br />\n8-0 rout of UMBC, in which the<br />\nlosers won only one set the entire<br />\nmatch, the Homewood<br />\nracqueteers racked up three<br />\nconsecutive 5-4 wins over<br />\nLoyola, Towson State and<br />\nWashington College, as well as a<br />\nwin over Widener, to give them<br />\ntheir five match sweep.

A late<br />\nhit by O'Leary after the shot<br />\nenlivened the Blue Jays enough<br />\nto produce three quick scores by<br />\nMyrick, Hirsch, and Pat Sinram,<br />\nwho converted a Thomas feed<br />\nthat Wittelsberger apparently<br />\nmissed.<br />\nCo-captain Rick Kowalchuk<br />\nclosed out the first half scorirg<br />\nwith his extra-man bullet from<br />\nthe right hand side, a regular<br />\nscoring feature, giving Hopkins a<br />\n7-2 lead at the break. Moments<br />\nbefore the half ended,<br />\nKowalchuk unleashed another<br />\nblazer that smashed Cadet<br />\nde fender Tom Turner in the<br />\nmask, sending him to the<br />\nhospital.<br />\nHopkins shut out the Black<br />\nKnights throughout the second<br />\nhalf until the last two minutes of<br />\nthe game, when Army scored a<br />\npower play goal.

Bentsen, a Democrat<br />\nfrom Texas dealt with a variety<br />\nof topics concerning the office of<br />\nthe President in his half hour<br />\ntalk. Included were the<br />\nPresident's role as a politician,<br />\nparty head, Commander in Chief,<br />\nand Chief Executive. Bentsen<br />\nalso touched upon such issues as<br /><br />\nthe decline of Congressional<br />\npower, the right of the public to<br />\nregister its opinion, and<br />\nimpeachment.<br />\n\"A President is required to be<br />\nmany things to millions of<br />\npeople. Above all, I think he<br />\nshould be a politician...able to<br />\ntranslate public opinion into<br />\naction,\" stated Bentsen.<br />\nHe also noted that since \"a<br />\nPresident can't conduct his<br />\nbusiness within a vacuum,\" the<br />\nability to work with both<br />\npolitical parties is essential.<br />\nAmong his other observations,<br />\nBentsen asserted that \"I see the<br />\nPresident as an analyst of<br />\nlegislation. He should execute.<br /><br />\nlaws, not kill them.\" He stressed<br />\nthe point that while the President<br />\nis free to offer legislation of his<br />\nown, he should not contradict<br />\nCongress. \u2022<br />\nHe also emphasized that a<br />\ngood President can delegate his<br />\nauthority to responsible<br />\nsubordinates. Bentsen stated that<br />\n\"the Chief Executive is not the<br />\nsole executive\" and urged that a<br />\nstrong Cabinet be placed above<br />\nany \"small White House clique.\"<br />\nFurthermore, he noted that \"it's<br />\nan unwise President who<br />\nbypasses his Cabinet\" and that a<br />\nPresident can be judged by the<br />\ntype of people he delegates<br />\nauthority to.<br /><br />\nVerdict pending on coed dorms<br />\nBy SUE EYRICH<br />\nIn approximately ten days, the<br />\nUniversity will decide whether or<br />\nnot to expand coeducational<br />\nHousing on campus for next<br />\nyear.<br />\nThe principal factors involved<br />\nin the decision will be the<br />\nnumber of female applicants that<br />\naccept their admission offers, and<br />\nthe number of next year's<br />\nFreshman who indicate a desire<br />\nfor coed housing, Peter Heist,<br />\nUniversity Housing Director,<br />\nrevealed yesterday.<br />\n\"The University is committed<br />\nto coed dorms and hopes to<br />\nexpand the existing facilities,\"<br />\nsaid Heist.<br />\nTwo of the suggested houses<br />\nfor conversion are Jennings<br />\nHouse in the new dorm complex<br />\nand the joint Vincent-Willard<br /><br />\nHouse in the old dorm complex.<br />\nHeist pointed out that he<br />\nthought the complaint of many<br />\nold dorm residents that they<br />\ndeserved coeducational housing<br />\nas much as new dorm residents<br />\nwas \"a valid one.\"<br />\nJennings was suggested for<br />\nconversion because of its<br />\nproximity to Lazear, presently<br />\nHopkins' only coed dormitory. If<br />\nJennings is selected a new<br />\nhousemaster plan would<br />\nprobably be implemented,<br />\naccording to Heist, whereby the<br />\nhousemasters of both Jennings<br />\nand Lazear would share the<br />\nresponsibility for the dorms.<br />\nLast year when an<br />\nunprecedented number of girls<br />\nopted for dormitory housing, the<br />\nHousing Office found itself in a<br />\ndifficult satiation, Heist stated.<br /><br />\nBentsen spent much of his talk<br />\ndiscussing the decline of<br />\nCongressional power. Fixing as<br />\nmuch blame on Congress as on<br />\nthe executive branch, he said that<br />\nthere is \"too much spotlight on<br />\nthe White House.\" Even though<br />\nhe feels that most people favor a<br />\nstrong President, he expressed a<br />\ndesire for greater Congressional<br />\nauthority in the future.<br />\nPresident and Public<br />\nAnother topic Bentsen<br />\nconsidered was the President's<br />\nrelation with the public. Urging a<br />\nmore candid attitude on the part<br />\nof the President, he deplored the<br />\ninacessibilify of the Chief<br />\nExecutive.<br />\nHe proposed more frequent<br />\npress conferences in order to<br />\nincrease the President's<br />\naccountability to the public.<br /><br />\nAlger Hiss to speak<br />\nat Whitehill Lecture<br /><br />\nAuk<br />\nDean Fitzpatrick<br />\nThere was not a sufficient<br />\nnumber to fill a new house or so<br />\nsmall a group as to be placed in<br />\nthe already existing female<br />\nhouses. Hopkins then attempted<br />\ncoeducation by converting<br />\nLazear House.<br />\nDean of Students Robert<br />\nFitzpatrick noted, \"Hopkins<br />\nwent into it out of necessity. But<br />\nthe response,\" he continued,<br />\n\"was so favorable that it seems<br />\nadvisable to have as much as<br />\npossible.\"<br />\n\"If and when, we find the<br />\nmoney for complete renovation<br />\nof the dormitories into suite<br />\naccomodations, I would like to<br />\nsee men and women in adjoining<br />\nsuites throughout the entire<br />\ndorm complex. But even prior to<br />\nthat, I would like to see more<br />\ncoeducational housing here at<br />\nHopkins,\" Fitzpatrick concluded.<br /><br />\nBy BOB DANNER<br />\nAlger Hiss will address the<br />\ntopic \"The Individual in<br />\nGovernment\" as part of the<br />\nMilford Whitehill Leadership<br />\nLectures Friday at 8 p.m. in<br />\nShriver Hall.<br />\nConducted by Omicron Delta<br />\nKappa, a national honorary<br />\nleadership society, the<br />\nlectureship sponsors speakers<br />\npolitically established and<br />\nnon-controversial, Mindy Farber,<br />\nco-chairperson of the event<br />\nexplained.<br />\nShe added that the speech will<br />\nbe of a traditional nature, but<br />\n\"we expect things to warm up<br />\nduring the question and answer<br /><br />\nCrime Report<br /><br />\nCrimes for week include attempted assault<br />\nAn at tempted assault of a coed<br />\nin front of the 34th and Charles<br />\nstreet entrance to campus<br />\noccurred last Wednesday at<br />\n10:28 p.m.<br />\nAccording to the campus<br />\npolice, the student was attacked<br />\nalong the side of the arch at that<br />\nentrance, but was able to escape<br />\nfrom her attacker, who had<br />\ngrabbed her from behind.<br />\nAccording to a friend of the<br />\nassaulted girl, a security man<br />\nshould have been stationed where<br />\nthe girl had been attacked.<br />\nHowever, the campus police<br />\nclaimed that they do not have a<br />\nsecurity man there.<br />\nOther crime-related matters<br />\nover the past week included<br /><br />\njuvenile disorders, a man bitten<br />\nby a dog, a fire along San Martin<br />\nDrive and an eye injury suffered<br />\nby a visitor to \"3400 On Stage.\"<br />\nThree separate juvenile<br />\ndisorders occurred. One involved<br />\nthe arrest of a fifteen year-old in<br />\nthe freshman dorm quad by the<br />\ncampus police, who was then<br />\nsubsequently turned over to the<br />\nBaltimore Police. The juvenile,<br />\nwtio was intoxicated at the time,<br />\nwas arrested on \"beligerent<br />\nbehavior.\"<br />\nAnother juvenile was detained<br />\nby the campus police after he<br />\nhad been disturbing people<br />\nwithin the MSE Library. The 17<br />\nyear old was taken in by the<br />\ncampus police and subsequently<br /><br />\nStressing that the President<br />\nshould present issues to the<br />\npeople in an honest fashion,<br />\nBentsen commented. \"The White<br />\nHouse should not become a good<br />\nnews machine.\"<br />\nCurriculum Vitae<br />\nAll of these observations come<br />\nfrom an experienced politician.<br />\nBentsen was first elected to thQ<br />\nHouse of Representatives in 1948<br />\nat age 27, the youngest member<br />\never to serve.<br />\nHe served there until 1954,<br />\nwhen he left politics to go into<br />\nprivate business.

The dog,<br />\nhowever, was impounded by the<br />\nCity Pound and is presently<br />\nundergoing observation.<br />\nA fire, believed to be of<br />\nsuspicious origin, was discovered<br />\nalong San Martin Drive at 9:35<br />\nlast Friday night. The Baltimore<br />\nCity Fire Department was called,<br />\nand the fire was quickly<br />\nextinguished. Although the fire<br />\nwas a small campfire, the fire<br />\nofficials were concerned due to<br />\nthe dryness of the surrounding<br />\narea, condusive to the fire's<br />\nspreading.<br /><br />\nIn the only accident reported<br />\nto campus security during the<br />\n\"3400 On Stage\" festivities, a<br />\nman slipped on Gilman steps,<br />\nresulting in the laceration of the<br />\narea under one of his eyes, wence<br />\nfrom his glasses, which were<br />\nshattered during the fall. The<br />\nman was taken to the Red Cross<br />\nFirst Aid Station. From there he<br />\nwas then transferred to Union<br />\nMemorial Hospital as a<br />\nprecautionary measure against<br />\npossible eye damage.

Towards<br />\nthat end, I plan to do my best to<br />\nfamiliarize myself with the status<br />\nof undergrads at the medical<br />\ninstitutions of East Baltimore,<br />\nand SAIS. I will try to bring<br />\nabout a greater utilization of<br />\nexisting university resources by<br />\nundergraduates and will pay<br />\nattention and will work for the<br />\ncontinual improvement of the<br />\nUniversity's faculty and facilities,<br />\nN-L: Do you see your role as<br />\none of undergraduate<br />\nrepresentative or as trustee of the<br />\nvested in te rests of the<br />\nUniversity?<br />\nHoffman: That's a shitty<br />\nquestion. That implies that the<br />\ninterests are mutually exclusive,<br />\nand I don't believe that they are.<br />\nN-L: If so, then why the need<br />\nspecifically for four Young<br />\nTrustees?<br />\nHoffman: Good question. I<br />\nbelieve the purpose of the Young<br />\nTrustee is to bring the Board the<br />\nperspective of a person primarily<br />\neffected by the University but<br />\nwho has otherwise little affect on<br />\nthe University.<br />\nN-L: Do you think the<br />\nposition was originally instituted<br />\nto placate discontented<br />\nundergraduates?<br />\nHoffman: If it was, and if we<br />\nhave been placated, then I believe<br />\nthe results of the Creation of this<br />\nposition have only been<br />\nconstructive.<br /><br />\nspecifically with the status of<br />\nacademics at Hopkins. In the Fall<br />\nof 1974, I will work to see to it<br />\nthat undergraduate reps of the<br />\nHomewood campus are given the<br />\nopportunity to make a 'State of<br />\nthe University' presentation at<br />\nthe Fall meeting. This will make<br />\nthe first opportunity for<br />\nundergraduates to imform and<br />\ninteract with the entire Board of<br />\nTrustees. There are four young<br />\nTrustees. There are about fifty<br />\nTrustees. It is vital that<br />\ncommunication exist between all<br />\nmembers of the Board and the<br />\nentire University.<br />\nN-L: Fine, but many of the<br />\ncandidates also have said that<br />\nthere really is no power in the<br />\nBoard \u2014 that it's just a rubber<br />\nstamp for the president which.<br />\nadmittedly they did select. Do<br />\nyou think that as one of fifty,<br />\nyou'll be able to accomplish<br />\nanything substantive whatsoever?<br />\nHoffman: Let's assume for a<br />\nminute, that the Board is nothing<br />\nmore than a rubber stamp for the<br />\nPresident. It becomes vital then<br />\nfor the members of the Board to<br />\nreflect an awareness of student<br />\nconcerns on matters which the<br />\nPresident brings to the Board. An<br />\nactive student body accompanied<br />\nby an educated Board of<br />\nTrustees, will make it difficult<br />\nfor the President to bring any<br />\nproposal to the Board without<br />\nfirst providing a complete and<br />\nreasonable explanation for his<br />\nplans. Notice that while I did say<br />\ncomplete and reasonable, I did<br />\nnot say desireable. Tuition<br />\nincreases are not desireable. The<br />\nburden of proof lies with the<br />\nPresident and the Administration<br />\nin cases such as these to justify to<br />\nboth the Hopkins Community<br />\nand the Board of Trustees such<br />\nactions.<br /><br />\nN- L: Would you care to<br />\nexpand on that?<br />\nHoffman: Even if the creation<br />\nof the position was only meant as<br />\na token to buy off the protestors<br />\nof the late sixties and early<br />\nseventies, it has still brought to<br />\nboth the Board and the student<br />\nbody a kind of interaction and<br />\nconcern that was previously<br />\nnon-existent. A good liberal<br />\nwould paraphrase that by saying:<br />\n\"as long as people are talking,<br />\nthere's hope.\"<br /><br />\nN-L: Still, do you think the<br />\nBoard is a rubber stamp for the<br />\nPresident?<br />\nHoffman: A vote against the<br />\nPresident or one of his major<br />\nrecommendations would seem to<br />\nme comparable to a vote of 'no<br />\nconfidence' in any political<br />\nstructure. The honesty and<br />\ncandor which I have received on<br />\nevery occasion in dealing with<br />\nPresident Muller makes me<br />\ncompletely confident that every<br />\nproposal he brings to the Board<br />\nof Trustees will be one that he<br />\nfeels is best for the Johns<br />\nHopkins University.<br /><br />\nN-L: Still, many of the Young<br />\nTrustees candidates complained<br />\nthat the existing Young Trustees'<br />\nhave had pitifully little<br />\ncom,munication with the<br />\nundergraduates once they've left<br />\ncampus. Do you still maintain<br />\nthat there has been interaction<br />\nbetween the two groups and<br />\nwhat do you plan to do to keep<br />\nof communication open, if<br />\nanything?<br />\nHoffman: In the past year, the<br />\nundergraduates through the<br />\nstudent Council have made two<br />\npresentations to the Board of<br />\nTrustees. \u00b0lie dealing with the<br />\nstatus of Undergraduate life in<br />\ngeneral. the other dealing<br /><br />\nN-L: Do you feel that there is<br />\nanything you can do to<br />\nrealistically help the<br />\nundergraduate with such problems<br />\nas housing, or more impOrtantly<br />\nimminent tuition hikes?<br />\nHoffman: On housing, yes. On<br />\ntuition hikes, no. I should like to<br />\nemphasize, that whatever<br />\nimprovements come about in<br />\nhousing, they will come about as<br />\na result of my interacions with<br />\npeople in the University,<br />\nparticularly the Dean of Students<br />\nOffice and the Housing Office. I<br />\ndo not feel that Undergraduate<br />\nhousing is a priority of<br />\nUndergraduate concerns to be<br />\nbrought to the Board of Trustees.<br /><br />\nWith regards to tuition, it will<br />\ntake the best brains of our<br />\ncountry to undo the damage<br />\nwhich Richard Nixon has<br />\nmanaged to bring about since<br />\n1968. I foresee continued hikes<br />\nin tuition. I pledge myself to<br />\nworking for convincing the Board<br />\nof Trustees that increased money<br />\nfor student, aid must be found.<br />\nI'm nor the first, and I won't be<br />\nthe last to work for this. I'll try. I<br />\nhope something can be done.<br />\nN-L: Do you think that the<br />\nBoard can have a significant<br />\ninput into academics here,<br />\nsomething you were very<br />\nconcerned with as an undergrad.<br />\nIsn't the AC pretty much the<br />\nfinal word on Academics?<br />\nHoffman: The Board should<br />\nnot and can not play a role in<br />\ndetermining the nature of<br />\nAcademics at Hopkins. I would<br />\nonly hope that the Board would<br />\nconcur in my belief that the<br />\nfaculty should be committed to<br />\nserving the entire community. I<br />\nfirmly believe in Milton S.<br />\nEisenhower's guideline of one<br />\nman, one course at the<br />\nUniversity, and I will work<br />\ntowards this end.<br />\nN-L: Does the nature of the<br />\ncomposition of the Board bother<br />\nyou, that it is, generally very<br />\nwealthy, nearly all male?<br />\nHoffman: Well let's assume<br />\nthat it does bother me. I'm open<br />\nto suggestions.<br />\nN-L: Do you believe, that a<br />\nwoman should perhaps, have<br />\nbeen selected as a Young Trustee<br />\neither this year, or last year, as<br />\none suggeston?<br />\nHoffman: I'll give you an<br />\nanswer that any self-respecting<br />\nradical would call a cop-out. The<br />\nperson who the Board believes<br />\nthe most concerned and<br />\ncommitted to improving the<br />\nquality of the Johns Hopkins<br />\nUniversity, ought to be chosen as<br />\nYoung Trustee. The decision<br />\nshould be made without regard<br />\nto race, religion, national origin,<br />\nor sex. But things don't always<br />\nhappen the way they should. I<br />\nbelieve that the perspective<br />\nbrought to the Board by a<br />\nwoman, a blatk or any minority<br />\ngroup student, would provide a<br />\nvaluable learning experience to<br />\nthe entire Board. Without<br />\nmeaning to sound conceited, I'm<br />\nglad that learning experience was<br />\npostponed for at least one year.<br />\nN-L: Do you think that your<br />\nbeing male either hindered or<br />\nhelped you in being selected?<br />\nHoffman: Yes.<br />\nN-L: Which one?<br />\nHoffman: Both.<br />\nN-L: That's another cop-out<br />\nisn't it?<br />\nHoffman: Yes it is. I don't<br />\nwant to try and second guess the<br />\ncommittee. I'm afraid that<br />\ntomorrow I might wake up and<br />\nfind that this has all been a<br />\ndream.<br />\nThe selections committee was<br />\nall male. I think in reverse<br />\ncircumstances, I would have felt<br />\nuneasy, had it been all women.

Perfunctorily dismissed<br />\nby the White House, they include<br />\nsubversion of the Bill of Rights<br />\n(illegal wiretaps, burglaries,<br />\npolitical sabotage in<br />\nelectioneering); usurpation of the<br />\nCongressional power to declare war<br />\n(secret bombing of Cambodia);<br />\nobstruction of justice (Watergate<br />\nand the firing of Archibald Cox);<br />\nillegal impoundment of over $40<br />\nbillion in Congressionally<br />\nauthorized funds; and the creation<br />\nof a special extralegal secret police<br />\nunit directly subordinate to the<br />\nWhite House.<br />\nWhether these charges are true<br />\nor not can ultimately only be<br />\ndetermined in a trial where all the<br />\ndesired evidence is made available.<br />\nThis condition is arrived at by a<br />\nmajority of the House of<br />\nRepresentatives voting to charge<br />\nthe President with \"high crimes<br />\nand misdemeanors\" and thereby<br />\nimpeaching him. Subsequently the<br />\naccused is tried before the Senate,<br />\nwhere a two-thirds vote is<br />\nnecessary for conviction and<br />\nconsequent disqualification from<br />\noffice.

This concern was<br /><br />\nrecently voiced by Congressman<br />\nJames Buckley, a staunch<br />\nconservative and loyal Republican,<br />\nwhen he abruptly called for<br />\nNixon's resignation as the only<br />\nsatisfactory and dignified solution<br />\nto this \"crisis of the regime.\"<br />\nUnfortunately, Nixon himself has<br />\npresently blocked this path by<br />\npublicly proclaiming that he will<br />\n\"not resign.\" Thus, impeachment<br />\nnot only seems to be necessary, it<br />\nalso appears to be inevitable.<br />\nIn the tangle of construction<br />\nplanks at Thomas Circle in<br />\nWashington, D.C., one's attention<br />\nis caught by some of the bright<br />\ncolors in the area: a profusion of<br />\nflaming-red . posters screaming<br />\n\"March To Impeach Nixon'- April<br />\n27!\" Half a block away, at 1404 M<br />\nStreet, the second floor of an old<br />\nbrick house had been converted<br />\ninto the headquarters of the<br />\nNational Campaign to Impeach<br />\nNixon. An organization without<br />\nany titled officers, the<br />\nquasi-director is a quiet- young<br />\nlawyer-type, Ted Glick, who has<br />\nbeen active in people's campaigns<br />\nfor over six years.<br />\nGlick acknowledged that there<br />\nare two groups pushing for<br />\nimpeachment. The first group is<br />\nprimarily concerned with<br />\n\"resolving the leadership crisis.\"<br />\nThis position is mainly held by<br />\nconservatives and Republicans.<br />\nWhether Nixon remains in office is<br />\nnot the prime concern here,<br />\nalthough it is generally assumed he<br />\nwill vindicate himself.<br />\nThe second group is not quite so<br />\ndelicate in their stance.

We are all familiar with<br />\nthe double standard of death;<br />\nkilling is alright in war, and in<br />\npunishment for certain crimes, but<br />\nit is not allowed under God.<br />\nA similar dichotomy in policy is<br />\napparent today in terms of<br />\ndiscrimination. It seems that some<br />\ngroups (medical schools) are<br />\nallowed to discriminate in certain<br />\nareas in which other groups are not<br />\nallowed to discriminate.<br />\nAs I leafed through a medical<br />\nschool catalogue I noticed the<br />\nfollowing sentence: \"While some<br />\npreferance is given to members of<br />\nthe Seventh-day Adventist church,<br />\nit is a firm policy of the<br />\nAdmissions Committee that a<br />\nnumber of non-church related<br />\napplicants be admitted each year.\"<br />\nAnd in another catalogue,<br />\n\"Preference is given to members of<br />\ndisadvantaged minority<br />\ngroups...women applicants have a<br />\nslight advantage.\"<br />\nIf the medical schools were<br />\nrestaurants, these quotes would<br />\nnot be on the walls. Yet to our<br />\nintuition it would seem reasonable<br />\nthat if a medical school were<br />\nstarted by Indians (so that there<br />\nwould be more Indian doctors)<br />\nthat that medical school should<br />\nhave the right to admit a high<br />\npercentage of Indians. But it<br />\ndoesn't sound reasonable if a<br />\nstudent is rejected from a public<br />\nschool in order to admit a less<br />\nqualified minority student.<br />\nOf course, I realize that<br />\ndiscrimination can have good<br />\neffects. Favored minority medical<br />\nstudents may tend to practice<br />\nmore in poverty areas. It is also<br />\ntrue that for certain crimes,<br />\npositive arguments can be created.<br />\nDoes this justify them?<br />\nWe must fine a precise answer to<br />\nthe question of discrimination.<br />\nThis answer must pertain to all<br />\nlevels of society, or the result will<br />\nbe a perpetuation of our present<br />\nconfusion toward discrimination.

Both runners advanced<br />\non a pass ball by pitcher Dave<br />\nNovak. Mike Bogdan grounded<br />\nout, bringing home a run, and<br />\nBilly Jones singled to tie the<br />\nscore at 2-2.<br />\nIn the fifth, Hopkins took the<br />\nlead when they rallied with two<br />\nouts.

Pedroni then drove a<br />\nball to center scoring Pucillo.<br />\nPodrazik, Bukowski and Bogdan<br />\nhit consecutive singles to drive<br />\nhome two more tallies. Jim<br />\nDuffy connected on a Novak<br />\npitch for a two base hit scoring<br />\nthe fourth run of the inning.<br />\nComing in for Evans in the top<br /><br />\nof the seventh, Ron Brown was<br />\nwild walking three batters in<br />\nboth the seventh and eighth<br />\nframes before buckling down to<br />\nget the final out. Brown struck<br />\nout Kerry Crocken on a 3-2 pitch<br />\nending the seventh and stopping<br />\nthat rally.
