Undergraduates must stop complaining among themselves about faculty advising, TAs, course offerings, departments,<br />\nclassroom instruction, and independent<br />\nstudy/research courses. The administration<br />\nand faculty won't make any changes unless<br />\nundergraduates tell them what needs to be<br />\nchanged.

And seniors shouldn't take the attitude, \"I'm leaving in a few months. What<br />\nthe hell do I care?\"<br />\nNow is the right time for the questionnaire. For two reasons.

The<br />\nthree are part Of the warn that<br />\nis building the Hopkins<br />\nUltraviolet Telescope (HUT),<br />\nwhich is scheduled to be used<br />\naboard the space shuttle beginning in March 1986. HUT is<br />\none of three instruments that<br />\nare to be launched, known collectively as the Astro missions.<br />\nDrs. Arthur F. Davidsen,<br />\nSamuel F. Durance and Knox<br />\nS. Long, as part of the Hopkins<br />\nastronomy team, will be competing with five other scientists<br />\nho also wish to be aboard the<br />\nshuttle. The other scientists are<br />\nfrom the University of Wisconsin and NASA's Goddard<br />\nSpace Flight Center in<br />\nGreenbelt, Maryland.<br />\nEach researcher who wanted<br />\nto be on a ride of the space<br />\nshuttle was required to have extensive physical examinations<br />\nand pre-flight stress tests. These<br />\ntests, which were completed<br />\nIwo weeks ago at NASA's<br />\nJohnson Space Center in<br />\nHouston. partly consisted of<br />\nbeing spun around in a chair at<br />\n15 r.p.m., getting into a personal security sphere, which is<br />\nfor emergencies in space, in<br />\norder to test for claustrophobic<br />\nindi% iduals. and a test of their<br />\noxygen intake and blood<br />\npressure, while running on a<br />\ntread mill. As Long etnphasized, fairly normal people can<br />\npass the physical and stress<br />\ntests. This is primarily because<br />\nthe shuttle is designed to make<br />\nspace accessible to normal<br />\nindividuals.<br />\nA committee, that is comprised of the principal investigators from the other two<br />\ninstruments' teams, and Dr.<br />\nPaul Feldman from Hopkins,<br />\nwill select the individuals that<br />\nshall be aboard the shuttle.<br />\n%WO Missions<br />\n<br />\nPlans for the Astro missions<br />\ngrew out of a 1978 NASA announcement that proposed<br />\nlaunching a select group of<br />\nastronomy instruments with the<br />\n<br />\nspace shuttle. As a result of the<br />\nannouncement, NASA received<br />\n160 proposals from researchers<br />\nall across the nation. Of these,<br />\n20 proposals were selected so as<br />\nto allow further study of their<br />\nfeasibility and usefulness.<br />\nThree proposals were then<br />\nselected and funding was provided by NASA for their construction. Each of the three instruments cost approximately<br />\n$10 million. Cost of' the entire<br />\nAstro missions project is expected to be $100 million. The<br />\nAstro missions' instruments,<br />\nwhich are an imaging telescope,<br />\na polariineter, and a spectrograph (HUT), will all investigate areas of the vacuum<br />\n.ultraviolet. Current plans call<br />\nfor three Astro missions with<br />\nthe possibility of additional<br />\nlaunches in the future.<br />\nIn contrast to many<br />\nastronomy instruments which<br />\nhave been or will be launched<br />\nand thereafter kept in space, the<br />\ninstruments of the Astro missions will return to earth after<br />\nthe completion of each shuttle<br />\nmission. It is this fact that will<br />\nallow researchers greater flexibility. If modifications to th<br />\ninstruments are necessary, they<br />\ncan he done between missions.<br />\nIt is this aspect of the project,<br />\nespecially when one considers<br />\nthat it is a major effort in<br />\nastronomy, that makes the<br />\nmissions \"fairly<br />\nAstro<br />\nunusual\", as Long stated.<br />\nThere are several other<br />\naspects of the Astro missions<br />\nthat will facilitate operation of<br />\nHUT and the other instruments. The shuttle missions<br />\nwill last about ten days, of<br />\nwhich about one and a half<br />\ndays will be used to launch<br />\nsatellites. One half of a day will<br />\nalso he used to prepare for landing. I he remaining eight days<br />\nw ill he available for observation<br />\nith the three instruments.<br />\nWit h t he inst rumen!s operating<br />\n24 hours a day for t he period of<br />\ntime they are in space and the<br />\nresearchers (two mission<br />\nspecialists to a Hight) also on<br />\nthe shuttle, the shuttle will be<br />\nworking like a ground-based<br />\nobservatory. The key element<br />\n<br />\nhere is human control and with<br />\nthis the researchers will gain a<br />\ngreat deal of flexibility. If the<br />\nresearchers find something very<br />\ninteresting to study while in<br />\nspace, they can change their<br />\nplanned observations.<br />\nAs Durrance pointed out<br />\nthough. the missions in which<br />\nHUT and the other instruments<br />\nwill actually be involved will<br />\nnot be to investigate areas of<br />\nspace in order to look for<br />\nthings. The instruments will instead be used to actually look<br />\nat an area of space and determine its various characteristics.<br />\nThis does not mean, though,<br />\nthat there will be no discoveries<br />\nof new phenomena. As Durance said, its \"not inconceivable that we will find<br />\nsomething we didn't know existed.\" This is especially true<br />\nwith the fact that the instruments aboard the Astro<br />\nmissions will be the most sensitive to date. It should also be<br />\nnoted that HUT will look at a<br />\nregion of the ultraviolet spec<br />\ntrum that the Space Telescope<br />\ndoes not.<br />\n<br />\nsolar system it is hoped that<br />\nresearchers can learn about the<br />\nproto-solar system and its gas<br />\nclouds. The data collected during the Astro mission will be<br />\ncorrelated with ground based<br />\ninformation and information<br />\ngathered from comet flyby instruments that are to be launched by Japan, the Soviet<br />\nUnion, and the European Space<br />\nAgency in order to get a clearer<br />\nunderstanding of comets.<br />\nAnother instrument of the<br />\nNstro missions, the photo<br />\npolarimeter from the University of Wisconsin, will be able to<br />\nJetermine the characteristics of<br />\n<br />\nInstruments on Shuttle<br />\nThe instruments of the Astro<br />\nmissions will be examining<br />\nvarious objects in space and<br />\neach of the three instruments<br />\nw ill he looking at them from a<br />\ndifferent aspect.<br />\nThe HUT will involve spec<br />\nroscopy, which will enable the<br />\ninstrument to gather information on gases, including their<br />\nconstituents, the temperature of<br />\nvarious objects in space, the<br />\nconditions of excitement of<br />\natoms, and magnetic fields.<br />\nSpecific tasks during the mission will include measurement<br />\nof the temperature of the atmosphere of various planets,<br />\nobservation of the auroral emissions of Uranus, and investigation of the tail of Halley's<br />\nComet, including its molecular<br />\ncomposition.<br />\nA substantial portion of time<br />\nduring the first Astro mission<br />\nwill, in fact, be for observing<br />\nHalley's Comet. With comets<br />\npresumably being made up of<br />\nelements from the primordial<br />\n<br />\nI Iii' Honk ul1' I loa% 101(.1 1 elescone<br />\n<br />\nJust grains in space. This will<br />\nhe especially useful when<br />\nresearchers examine the tail of<br />\nHalley's Cornet.<br />\nThe ultra\u2018iolet imaging<br />\ntelescope, from researchers at<br />\nGoddard Space Flight Center,<br />\nwill produce excellent images of<br />\nobjects that the various instruments are to study. Among<br />\nits tasks will be to study the<br />\nstrong hydrogen emissions of<br />\nHalley's Comet, the morphology of the comet, and its<br />\nCO emission. All of' this will<br />\nhelp scientists to discern the<br />\nspatial structure of the comet.<br />\nAdditional tasks of the Astro<br />\nmissions' instruments will be to<br />\nexamine very hot (100,000<br />\ndegrees) white dwarf stars,<br />\nquasars, the interstellar<br />\nmedium, the intergalactic<br />\nmedium, and super nova remnants. The instruments will also<br />\nsearch for clues about the Big<br />\nBang, including the question of<br />\n\"what really is the helium<br />\nabundance in the universe?\"<br />\nscientific Team<br />\n<br />\nRichard Childress photo courtesy<br />\n<br />\n14% Domini t<br />\n<br />\n1)3% Olsen u nil Long<br />\n<br />\nwith the various astronomy<br />\nprojects on campus.<br />\nEach of the project's leaders<br />\nis outstanding in his field and<br />\neach has his own area of special<br />\ninterest.<br />\nDavidsen, who is the pro<br />\nject's special investigator and<br />\nhas been on the Hopkins faculty for eight years, desires to<br />\nfind out the characteristics of<br />\nquasars, active galactic nuclei,<br />\nand the evolution of these<br />\nobjects.<br />\nDurrance, who was a<br />\npostdoctoral fellow at Hopkins,<br />\nis part of the scientific staff of<br />\nthe physics department.

Several other coinvestigators of' the HUT project are from Hopkins, including Dr. William Fastie, Dr.<br />\nPaul Feldman, Dr. Warren<br />\nMoos, and Dr. Richard Henry.<br />\nMany of the basic components of' the HUT are being<br />\nmanufactured in local factories<br />\nand machine shops. Some portions arc also being fabricated<br />\nright on campus. Some of the<br />\ndetailed mechanical systems<br />\nengineering for HUT is being<br />\ndone at the Applied Physics<br />\nLab.

In places<br />\nwhere the play itself becomes a<br />\nlittle too pedantic, too heavyhanded, Mokac saves himself<br />\nand the work through sheer<br />\ntalent.<br />\nWillie, the other waiter, takes<br />\nthird place in the play, since the<br />\ncentral conflict involves Nally<br />\nand Sam. But Ray Aranha's<br />\nperformance as Willie should<br />\nnot go unremarked. Though his<br />\ncharacter lacks Sam's special<br />\nsensitivity, Aranha is as versatile and as believable as<br />\nMokae in his goofy -hut empathetic portrayal of Willie.<br />\nMostly, this is a play about<br />\nracial prejudice. But it is also a<br />\nplay about love, and about how<br />\nsociety can disrupt the very real<br />\nlove that even the unlikable<br />\nUtility can display for Sam. In<br />\nthe end, society demands that<br />\nSam permit Nally to make his<br />\nchoice: to abandon love and<br />\nrespect in order to assert the<br />\nrole of master. But once Hally<br />\nforces Sam to call him 'Master<br />\nHarold', Sam will never call<br />\nhim Hall y again. This is not a<br />\nthreat. hut a simple statement<br />\nof the reality of the master/servant relationship.

His choice will<br />\naffect not only his relationship<br />\nwith Sam, but with all blacks.<br />\nIt is on that choice that the<br />\nplay hinges, not on the more<br />\ndramatic incident where Nally<br />\nspits in Sam's face. The mere<br />\nfact that it is a choice, a matter<br />\nof personal volition, means that<br />\nthis is not a play of despair.<br />\nThough we may despair of the<br />\nlove that Nally and Sam once<br />\nhad for one another, we are left<br />\nwith the distant hope that in<br />\nsome other time, in some other<br />\nconfrontation, the vision Nally briefly had from Sam of \"a<br />\nworld without collisions\" may<br />\ntriumph over anger and<br />\ndistrust.

Ingalls<br />\nand Tony Straiges, respectively). I believe that the director,<br />\nJackson Phippin, was attempting to create a sense of various<br />\nfixed locations on the almos!<br />\nbare stage as well as a sense of<br />\nhabitual motion, but he created<br />\ninstead a vague sterility<br />\n<br />\nespecially in the area that he<br />\ndesignates as the Webb family<br />\nkitchen.<br />\nThe only weakness in the<br />\ncast, unfortunately, lies in the<br />\nleads, George Gibbs and Emily Webb. Emily, played by Lill<br />\nFlanders, was poorly portrayed. Miss Flanders seemed<br />\nunable to express the more sensitive aspects of Emily's<br />\ncharacter, although it was apparent that she understood<br />\nwhat was required. She also<br />\nseemed markedly uncomfortable when playing Emily as a<br />\nteenager.<br />\nPeter Mackenzie, in the role<br />\nof George Gibbs, also had difficulty in portraying a teenager,<br />\nalthough not to the same extent<br />\nas Miss Flanders. His main<br />\ncharacterization problem was<br />\nthat the development of George<br />\nGibbs relied heavily on that of<br />\nEmily Webb, and there seemed<br />\nto be a definite lack of onstage<br />\n<br />\nPress Photo<br />\nRitherl Mackinint as Dr (.011).<br />\ncommunication bet veen the ac- audience through the lives of<br />\ntors, resulting in some very George and Emily is excellent.<br />\nIt would be interesting to see<br />\nstilted scenes.<br />\nthis<br />\nplay again near the end of<br />\nweaknesses<br />\nFort u!lately, the<br />\nrun<br />\nits<br />\nwhen time has had a<br />\nand<br />\nGeorge<br />\nof<br />\nin the characters<br />\nEmily were offset by a very chance to iron out the basic<br />\nstrong performance by Robert problems in the production, as<br />\nGerringer as the Stage it possesses the potential for a<br />\nManager.

Set in<br />\n\"the Dining Room\u2014or many<br />\ndining rooms over the course of<br />\nmany years...\" as the program<br />\nnote says, the play moves back<br />\n<br />\nand forth in time, presenting a<br />\nseries of vignettes that are<br />\nsometimes warm, often<br />\nhilariously satirical, and occasionally broadly humorous or<br />\nsentimental.<br />\nAs they vary in tone, the different scenes vary in quality. In<br />\nsome the humor is absolutely<br />\non target\u2014Gurney has a flair<br />\nfor crisp and witty dialogue,<br />\nand he evokes with precision<br />\n<br />\nthe conventions and pretensions<br />\nof the American upper middle<br />\nclass, complete with excruciating children's birthday<br />\nclubs,<br />\nparties, country<br />\ncotillions, and full china services.

The peculiarities<br />\nof the play make it difficult to<br />\nperform, since the brief and<br />\nsometimes overlapping vignettes require the players to<br />\ntake on many different parts<br />\nand often to act without<br />\nacknowledging the presence of<br />\nthe other actors on the stage.<br />\nRuth Lawson Walsh and<br />\nRobert V.

What<br />\nstarted out as a \"joke\" late last<br />\nyear, blossomed this fall, as a<br />\nteam was formed, money raised through raffles and<br />\n\"drinkathons\", and a schedule<br />\nplanned. While there are only<br />\nfifteen team members, as opposed to the normal collegiate<br />\nlimit of 23, all are very excited<br />\nand confident that the sport's<br />\npopularity at Hopkin, will<br />\ngrow.<br />\nSo far, the team has been<br />\npracticing at the Civic Center,<br />\nusually immediately following a<br />\nSkipjacks (tame (it's cheapest<br />\nthen). The exhibition season<br />\nbegan November 2 and lasted<br />\nfive games, the Skipjacks,<br />\nUniversity of Pennsylvania,<br />\nLehigh University, York College, and Washington College<br />\nbeing the opponents. Unofficially, the team was 3-2, losing a close (5-4) game to the<br />\nUniversity of Pennsylvania and<br />\nbeing battered by the Skipjacks<br />\n7-2. Coach Steve Saliar was impressed though and commented<br />\nthat \"this team is playing very<br />\nwell, especially for a first year<br />\nteam.\"<br />\nDue to scheduling problems.<br />\n<br />\nCoach Salzar was forced to<br />\nstart the season against two<br />\nstrong teams, playing Boston<br />\nUniversity and Boston College<br />\nwithin a three night span. Said<br />\nCoach Salzar, \"I would have<br />\npreferred to have played a couple of easier, local opponents,<br />\nbut they begin their season<br />\nearlier than the Boston area<br />\nteams.\"<br />\nDespite the inherent odds<br />\nagainst them, the Blue .lays<br />\nmanaged to return to Baltimore<br />\nwith a 1-I record, although they<br />\nwere outscored by their two opponents 9-7.

The Terrier defense played<br />\nlaiily and continued to allow<br />\nthe Jays to clog the crease,<br />\nscreening the BU goalie. The<br />\nBlue Jays took 14 shots on goal<br />\nand registered four scores, two<br />\nby right-wing titian 'Tang.<br />\nMeanwhile, the Jays' defense.<br />\nanchored by goalie Ron Israeli,<br />\nwas tight, allowing only seven<br />\nshots on goal and one tally.<br />\nThe action slowed down in<br />\nt he second and third periods as<br />\nHopkins attempted to protect<br />\n<br />\nits lead. Defenseman Howard<br />\nBregman's unassisted goal at<br />\n10:50 of the third period iced<br />\nthe decision for the Jays<br />\nalthough the Terriers scored<br />\ntwo late goals to make the final<br />\nscore 6-4.<br />\nTwo nights later, the Jays<br />\nmet Boston College, in the<br />\nEagles' season (Termer.

Tuesday night in<br />\ntheir home opener the Jays<br />\nwere defeated by a tough Get tsyburg squad, 76-61.

''They<br />\ndominated the boards and got<br />\nthe loose balls,\" said Hopkins<br />\ncoach Ed Doherty. \"That was<br />\n<br />\nthe difference in the game.\"<br />\nGettysburg came out fast,<br />\ntaking a 17-8 lead. They upped<br />\ntheir advantage to 23-12, but<br />\nHopkins came back with some<br />\nfast break baskets, including a<br />\nslam dunk off a rebound by<br />\nBob Clayton, to bring the Jays<br />\nwithin three at 28-25.<br />\nThe Jays came out quickly in<br />\nthe second half and jumped to<br />\nir 31-30 lead.

The Jays were hurt<br />\nby sloppy passing and when<br />\nHopkins went into a press, Gettysburg broke it easily and converted .on a number of uncontested baskets. Coach<br />\nDoherty tried a number of different player combinations, hut<br />\nnone really worked and Gettysburg coasted to a 76-61<br />\nvictory.<br />\nThe Jays actually outshot<br />\nGettysburg 44g/o to 400/o from<br />\nthe field, hut while the Jays<br />\nshot 5 for 8 from the foul line,<br />\ntook<br />\nan<br />\nGettsyburg<br />\nunbelievable 46 foul shots, converting 31 of them. Many of<br />\nthem were caused by Hopkins<br />\ninability to box out, forcing<br />\nthem to go over the backs of the<br />\nGettysburg rebounders.<br />\nNick Nikic led the .lays with<br />\nseventeen points, many of<br />\nwhich were scored as the Jays<br />\nvainly attempted a run at Gettysburg late in the game. Nikic_<br />\nalso had six rebounds and passed well, with three assists. Bob<br />\nClayton led Hopkins with 9 rebounds add scored 12 points on<br />\nsix baskets. But Clayton got into foul trouble in the second<br />\nhalf, which hurt the Jays. Ed<br />\nKasoff and Bob Wilson had 8<br />\nand 9 points respectively.<br />\nAgainst Gallaudet Hopkins<br />\ncame back late in the game to<br />\n<br />\nwin by eight. Nikic led the Jays<br />\nwith 22 points and grabbed 17<br />\nrebounds. Clayton scored 19<br />\nand pulled down 18 rebounds.<br />\nBob Wilson chipped in 14<br />\npoints. .According to coach<br />\nDoherty, the Jays did not play<br />\nthat well. \"We missed from the<br />\noutside and it appeared as if we<br />\nhad some first-game jitters.<br />\nAlso, the guys weren't getting<br />\nback on defense.\"<br />\nEven though the Blue Jays<br />\nlost by 43 to Maryland, DohertY was happy with the team's<br />\nplay. \"We only had 15 turnovers: Glen (Wall) dribbled<br />\nwell and Clayton looked good.<br />\nThey were so big and quick.<br />\nThey hit the hoards harder than<br />\nan' team I've seen.\"<br />\n<br />\nWomen's<br />\nBasketball<br />\ncont. 1/of! p. 14<br />\n1.ar orck\u2022\u2022 \u2018\u2018ho hit 1 our field<br />\ngoals in her 15 minutes of play,<br />\nled Hopkins scorers along with<br />\nKlauber with eight points.<br />\nHirschhorn had seven, while<br />\nSarah liausserman and Celeste<br />\nDel3api isle had three and two,<br />\nrespect] ely.

Undergraduates must stop complaining among themselves about faculty advising, TAs, course offerings, departments,<br />\nclassroom instruction, and independent<br />\nstudy/research courses. The administration<br />\nand faculty won't make any changes unless<br />\nundergraduates tell them what needs to be<br />\nchanged.

The<br />\nthree are part Of the warn that<br />\nis building the Hopkins<br />\nUltraviolet Telescope (HUT),<br />\nwhich is scheduled to be used<br />\naboard the space shuttle beginning in March 1986. HUT is<br />\none of three instruments that<br />\nare to be launched, known collectively as the Astro missions.<br />\nDrs. Arthur F. Davidsen,<br />\nSamuel F. Durance and Knox<br />\nS. Long, as part of the Hopkins<br />\nastronomy team, will be competing with five other scientists<br />\nho also wish to be aboard the<br />\nshuttle. The other scientists are<br />\nfrom the University of Wisconsin and NASA's Goddard<br />\nSpace Flight Center in<br />\nGreenbelt, Maryland.<br />\nEach researcher who wanted<br />\nto be on a ride of the space<br />\nshuttle was required to have extensive physical examinations<br />\nand pre-flight stress tests. These<br />\ntests, which were completed<br />\nIwo weeks ago at NASA's<br />\nJohnson Space Center in<br />\nHouston. partly consisted of<br />\nbeing spun around in a chair at<br />\n15 r.p.m., getting into a personal security sphere, which is<br />\nfor emergencies in space, in<br />\norder to test for claustrophobic<br />\nindi% iduals. and a test of their<br />\noxygen intake and blood<br />\npressure, while running on a<br />\ntread mill. As Long etnphasized, fairly normal people can<br />\npass the physical and stress<br />\ntests. This is primarily because<br />\nthe shuttle is designed to make<br />\nspace accessible to normal<br />\nindividuals.<br />\nA committee, that is comprised of the principal investigators from the other two<br />\ninstruments' teams, and Dr.<br />\nPaul Feldman from Hopkins,<br />\nwill select the individuals that<br />\nshall be aboard the shuttle.<br />\n%WO Missions<br /><br />\nPlans for the Astro missions<br />\ngrew out of a 1978 NASA announcement that proposed<br />\nlaunching a select group of<br />\nastronomy instruments with the<br /><br />\nspace shuttle. As a result of the<br />\nannouncement, NASA received<br />\n160 proposals from researchers<br />\nall across the nation. Of these,<br />\n20 proposals were selected so as<br />\nto allow further study of their<br />\nfeasibility and usefulness.<br />\nThree proposals were then<br />\nselected and funding was provided by NASA for their construction. Each of the three instruments cost approximately<br />\n$10 million. Cost of' the entire<br />\nAstro missions project is expected to be $100 million. The<br />\nAstro missions' instruments,<br />\nwhich are an imaging telescope,<br />\na polariineter, and a spectrograph (HUT), will all investigate areas of the vacuum<br />\n.ultraviolet. Current plans call<br />\nfor three Astro missions with<br />\nthe possibility of additional<br />\nlaunches in the future.<br />\nIn contrast to many<br />\nastronomy instruments which<br />\nhave been or will be launched<br />\nand thereafter kept in space, the<br />\ninstruments of the Astro missions will return to earth after<br />\nthe completion of each shuttle<br />\nmission. It is this fact that will<br />\nallow researchers greater flexibility. If modifications to th<br />\ninstruments are necessary, they<br />\ncan he done between missions.<br />\nIt is this aspect of the project,<br />\nespecially when one considers<br />\nthat it is a major effort in<br />\nastronomy, that makes the<br />\nmissions \"fairly<br />\nAstro<br />\nunusual\", as Long stated.<br />\nThere are several other<br />\naspects of the Astro missions<br />\nthat will facilitate operation of<br />\nHUT and the other instruments. The shuttle missions<br />\nwill last about ten days, of<br />\nwhich about one and a half<br />\ndays will be used to launch<br />\nsatellites. One half of a day will<br />\nalso he used to prepare for landing. I he remaining eight days<br />\nw ill he available for observation<br />\nith the three instruments.<br />\nWit h t he inst rumen!s operating<br />\n24 hours a day for t he period of<br />\ntime they are in space and the<br />\nresearchers (two mission<br />\nspecialists to a Hight) also on<br />\nthe shuttle, the shuttle will be<br />\nworking like a ground-based<br />\nobservatory. The key element<br /><br />\nhere is human control and with<br />\nthis the researchers will gain a<br />\ngreat deal of flexibility. If the<br />\nresearchers find something very<br />\ninteresting to study while in<br />\nspace, they can change their<br />\nplanned observations.<br />\nAs Durrance pointed out<br />\nthough. the missions in which<br />\nHUT and the other instruments<br />\nwill actually be involved will<br />\nnot be to investigate areas of<br />\nspace in order to look for<br />\nthings. The instruments will instead be used to actually look<br />\nat an area of space and determine its various characteristics.<br />\nThis does not mean, though,<br />\nthat there will be no discoveries<br />\nof new phenomena. As Durance said, its \"not inconceivable that we will find<br />\nsomething we didn't know existed.\" This is especially true<br />\nwith the fact that the instruments aboard the Astro<br />\nmissions will be the most sensitive to date. It should also be<br />\nnoted that HUT will look at a<br />\nregion of the ultraviolet spec<br />\ntrum that the Space Telescope<br />\ndoes not.<br /><br />\nsolar system it is hoped that<br />\nresearchers can learn about the<br />\nproto-solar system and its gas<br />\nclouds. The data collected during the Astro mission will be<br />\ncorrelated with ground based<br />\ninformation and information<br />\ngathered from comet flyby instruments that are to be launched by Japan, the Soviet<br />\nUnion, and the European Space<br />\nAgency in order to get a clearer<br />\nunderstanding of comets.<br />\nAnother instrument of the<br />\nNstro missions, the photo<br />\npolarimeter from the University of Wisconsin, will be able to<br />\nJetermine the characteristics of<br /><br />\nInstruments on Shuttle<br />\nThe instruments of the Astro<br />\nmissions will be examining<br />\nvarious objects in space and<br />\neach of the three instruments<br />\nw ill he looking at them from a<br />\ndifferent aspect.<br />\nThe HUT will involve spec<br />\nroscopy, which will enable the<br />\ninstrument to gather information on gases, including their<br />\nconstituents, the temperature of<br />\nvarious objects in space, the<br />\nconditions of excitement of<br />\natoms, and magnetic fields.<br />\nSpecific tasks during the mission will include measurement<br />\nof the temperature of the atmosphere of various planets,<br />\nobservation of the auroral emissions of Uranus, and investigation of the tail of Halley's<br />\nComet, including its molecular<br />\ncomposition.<br />\nA substantial portion of time<br />\nduring the first Astro mission<br />\nwill, in fact, be for observing<br />\nHalley's Comet. With comets<br />\npresumably being made up of<br />\nelements from the primordial<br /><br />\nI Iii' Honk ul1' I loa% 101(.1 1 elescone<br /><br />\nJust grains in space. This will<br />\nhe especially useful when<br />\nresearchers examine the tail of<br />\nHalley's Cornet.<br />\nThe ultra\u2018iolet imaging<br />\ntelescope, from researchers at<br />\nGoddard Space Flight Center,<br />\nwill produce excellent images of<br />\nobjects that the various instruments are to study. Among<br />\nits tasks will be to study the<br />\nstrong hydrogen emissions of<br />\nHalley's Comet, the morphology of the comet, and its<br />\nCO emission. All of' this will<br />\nhelp scientists to discern the<br />\nspatial structure of the comet.<br />\nAdditional tasks of the Astro<br />\nmissions' instruments will be to<br />\nexamine very hot (100,000<br />\ndegrees) white dwarf stars,<br />\nquasars, the interstellar<br />\nmedium, the intergalactic<br />\nmedium, and super nova remnants. The instruments will also<br />\nsearch for clues about the Big<br />\nBang, including the question of<br />\n\"what really is the helium<br />\nabundance in the universe?\"<br />\nscientific Team<br /><br />\nRichard Childress photo courtesy<br /><br />\n14% Domini t<br /><br />\n1)3% Olsen u nil Long<br /><br />\nwith the various astronomy<br />\nprojects on campus.<br />\nEach of the project's leaders<br />\nis outstanding in his field and<br />\neach has his own area of special<br />\ninterest.<br />\nDavidsen, who is the pro<br />\nject's special investigator and<br />\nhas been on the Hopkins faculty for eight years, desires to<br />\nfind out the characteristics of<br />\nquasars, active galactic nuclei,<br />\nand the evolution of these<br />\nobjects.<br />\nDurrance, who was a<br />\npostdoctoral fellow at Hopkins,<br />\nis part of the scientific staff of<br />\nthe physics department.

Several other coinvestigators of' the HUT project are from Hopkins, including Dr. William Fastie, Dr.<br />\nPaul Feldman, Dr. Warren<br />\nMoos, and Dr. Richard Henry.<br />\nMany of the basic components of' the HUT are being<br />\nmanufactured in local factories<br />\nand machine shops. Some portions arc also being fabricated<br />\nright on campus. Some of the<br />\ndetailed mechanical systems<br />\nengineering for HUT is being<br />\ndone at the Applied Physics<br />\nLab. Assembly of HUT will be<br />\non the Homewood campus.<br />\nThus, the HUT project has<br />\nbeen to a great degree a \"hands<br />\non\" project. In this manner it<br />\nhas given graduate students at<br />\nHopkins a lot of experience<br />\nwith such instruments.<br />\nThe HUT will be put<br />\ntogether by .lanuary 1985 when<br />\nit is scheduled to be delivered to<br />\nKennedy Space Center in<br />\nFlorida.

In places<br />\nwhere the play itself becomes a<br />\nlittle too pedantic, too heavyhanded, Mokac saves himself<br />\nand the work through sheer<br />\ntalent.<br />\nWillie, the other waiter, takes<br />\nthird place in the play, since the<br />\ncentral conflict involves Nally<br />\nand Sam. But Ray Aranha's<br />\nperformance as Willie should<br />\nnot go unremarked. Though his<br />\ncharacter lacks Sam's special<br />\nsensitivity, Aranha is as versatile and as believable as<br />\nMokae in his goofy -hut empathetic portrayal of Willie.<br />\nMostly, this is a play about<br />\nracial prejudice. But it is also a<br />\nplay about love, and about how<br />\nsociety can disrupt the very real<br />\nlove that even the unlikable<br />\nUtility can display for Sam. In<br />\nthe end, society demands that<br />\nSam permit Nally to make his<br />\nchoice: to abandon love and<br />\nrespect in order to assert the<br />\nrole of master. But once Hally<br />\nforces Sam to call him 'Master<br />\nHarold', Sam will never call<br />\nhim Hall y again. This is not a<br />\nthreat. hut a simple statement<br />\nof the reality of the master/servant relationship. Once Nally<br /><br />\nchooses to regard his relationship with Sam in this light, he<br />\nwill have to live with it for the<br />\nrest of his life. His choice will<br />\naffect not only his relationship<br />\nwith Sam, but with all blacks.<br />\nIt is on that choice that the<br />\nplay hinges, not on the more<br />\ndramatic incident where Nally<br />\nspits in Sam's face. The mere<br />\nfact that it is a choice, a matter<br />\nof personal volition, means that<br />\nthis is not a play of despair.<br />\nThough we may despair of the<br />\nlove that Nally and Sam once<br />\nhad for one another, we are left<br />\nwith the distant hope that in<br />\nsome other time, in some other<br />\nconfrontation, the vision Nally briefly had from Sam of \"a<br />\nworld without collisions\" may<br />\ntriumph over anger and<br />\ndistrust.

I was afraid that being<br />\nat Homewood for so long may<br />\nhave dulled my appreciation for<br />\ntop quality theatre.

It<br />\nbegins in their childhood and<br />\nprogresses through a series of<br />\nsketches of the important<br />\nmovements of their lives. The<br />\nplay is guided by a character<br />\ncalled \"the stage manager\",<br />\nho narrates, interprets and<br />\nsets the scene for the various<br />\nsketches. Our Town does not<br />\nrely on physical props and as<br />\nsuch; the use of an actual set is<br />\nminimal, and greater emphasis<br />\nis placed on the psychological<br />\nrealization of these elements.<br />\nMany of the technical aspects<br />\nof the play were inconsisteni;<br />\nsome were both annoying and<br />\nirrelevant. Sound recordings<br />\nwere perhaps the most blatantly misused technical effect,<br />\nleaving almost nothing to the<br />\nimagination: they recreate<br />\neverything from a metallic<br />\nsounding rooster at morning<br />\ntime to a quiet \"phloop\" when<br />\nthe paper boy throws an imaginary paper on an imaginary<br />\nporch.<br />\nThe utilization of the stage<br />\nwas also somewhat disturbing,<br />\ndespite superb lighting and set<br />\ndesigns (by .lames F. Ingalls<br />\nand Tony Straiges, respectively). I believe that the director,<br />\nJackson Phippin, was attempting to create a sense of various<br />\nfixed locations on the almos!<br />\nbare stage as well as a sense of<br />\nhabitual motion, but he created<br />\ninstead a vague sterility<br /><br />\nespecially in the area that he<br />\ndesignates as the Webb family<br />\nkitchen.<br />\nThe only weakness in the<br />\ncast, unfortunately, lies in the<br />\nleads, George Gibbs and Emily Webb. Emily, played by Lill<br />\nFlanders, was poorly portrayed.

What<br />\nstarted out as a \"joke\" late last<br />\nyear, blossomed this fall, as a<br />\nteam was formed, money raised through raffles and<br />\n\"drinkathons\", and a schedule<br />\nplanned. While there are only<br />\nfifteen team members, as opposed to the normal collegiate<br />\nlimit of 23, all are very excited<br />\nand confident that the sport's<br />\npopularity at Hopkin, will<br />\ngrow.<br />\nSo far, the team has been<br />\npracticing at the Civic Center,<br />\nusually immediately following a<br />\nSkipjacks (tame (it's cheapest<br />\nthen). The exhibition season<br />\nbegan November 2 and lasted<br />\nfive games, the Skipjacks,<br />\nUniversity of Pennsylvania,<br />\nLehigh University, York College, and Washington College<br />\nbeing the opponents. Unofficially, the team was 3-2, losing a close (5-4) game to the<br />\nUniversity of Pennsylvania and<br />\nbeing battered by the Skipjacks<br />\n7-2. Coach Steve Saliar was impressed though and commented<br />\nthat \"this team is playing very<br />\nwell, especially for a first year<br />\nteam.\"<br />\nDue to scheduling problems.<br /><br />\nCoach Salzar was forced to<br />\nstart the season against two<br />\nstrong teams, playing Boston<br />\nUniversity and Boston College<br />\nwithin a three night span. Said<br />\nCoach Salzar, \"I would have<br />\npreferred to have played a couple of easier, local opponents,<br />\nbut they begin their season<br />\nearlier than the Boston area<br />\nteams.\"<br />\nDespite the inherent odds<br />\nagainst them, the Blue .lays<br />\nmanaged to return to Baltimore<br />\nwith a 1-I record, although they<br />\nwere outscored by their two opponents 9-7. In their firm game.<br />\nversus Boston Link ersit y, the<br />\n.lays tried to get an early lead.<br />\nSaid Center Bill Bay, \"we<br />\nfigured they would he relaxed,<br />\nnot expecting us to be a difficult<br />\nopponent.\"<br />\nThe Blue .lays gambled often<br />\nin the first period and it paid<br />\noff. The Terrier defense played<br />\nlaiily and continued to allow<br />\nthe Jays to clog the crease,<br />\nscreening the BU goalie. The<br />\nBlue Jays took 14 shots on goal<br />\nand registered four scores, two<br />\nby right-wing titian 'Tang.<br />\nMeanwhile, the Jays' defense.<br />\nanchored by goalie Ron Israeli,<br />\nwas tight, allowing only seven<br />\nshots on goal and one tally.<br />\nThe action slowed down in<br />\nt he second and third periods as<br />\nHopkins attempted to protect<br /><br />\nits lead. Defenseman Howard<br />\nBregman's unassisted goal at<br />\n10:50 of the third period iced<br />\nthe decision for the Jays<br />\nalthough the Terriers scored<br />\ntwo late goals to make the final<br />\nscore 6-4.<br />\nTwo nights later, the Jays<br />\nmet Boston College, in the<br />\nEagles' season (Termer. Unfortunately for Hopkins, BC was<br />\nmuch more prepared than their<br />\ncross-town rivals at BU were.

Tuesday night in<br />\ntheir home opener the Jays<br />\nwere defeated by a tough Get tsyburg squad, 76-61. The Jays<br />\nhad opened their season with a<br />\n80-72 victory over Gallaudet<br />\nand lost last Saturday night<br /><br />\n108-65 at Cole Field House to<br />\na powerful Maryland team.<br />\nSloppy ball handling and<br />\ntenacious rebounding by Gettsyburg led to a Hopkins defeat.<br />\nThe .lays committed 26 turnovers and were out rebounded<br />\n45-31, with Gettysburg often<br />\ngetting two or three shots each<br />\ntrip downcourt. ''They<br />\ndominated the boards and got<br />\nthe loose balls,\" said Hopkins<br />\ncoach Ed Doherty. \"That was<br /><br />\nthe difference in the game.\"<br />\nGettysburg came out fast,<br />\ntaking a 17-8 lead. They upped<br />\ntheir advantage to 23-12, but<br />\nHopkins came back with some<br />\nfast break baskets, including a<br />\nslam dunk off a rebound by<br />\nBob Clayton, to bring the Jays<br />\nwithin three at 28-25.<br />\nThe Jays came out quickly in<br />\nthe second half and jumped to<br />\nir 31-30 lead.

The Jays were hurt<br />\nby sloppy passing and when<br />\nHopkins went into a press, Gettysburg broke it easily and converted .on a number of uncontested baskets. Coach<br />\nDoherty tried a number of different player combinations, hut<br />\nnone really worked and Gettysburg coasted to a 76-61<br />\nvictory.<br />\nThe Jays actually outshot<br />\nGettysburg 44g/o to 400/o from<br />\nthe field, hut while the Jays<br />\nshot 5 for 8 from the foul line,<br />\ntook<br />\nan<br />\nGettsyburg<br />\nunbelievable 46 foul shots, converting 31 of them. Many of<br />\nthem were caused by Hopkins<br />\ninability to box out, forcing<br />\nthem to go over the backs of the<br />\nGettysburg rebounders.<br />\nNick Nikic led the .lays with<br />\nseventeen points, many of<br />\nwhich were scored as the Jays<br />\nvainly attempted a run at Gettysburg late in the game. Nikic_<br />\nalso had six rebounds and passed well, with three assists. Bob<br />\nClayton led Hopkins with 9 rebounds add scored 12 points on<br />\nsix baskets. But Clayton got into foul trouble in the second<br />\nhalf, which hurt the Jays. Ed<br />\nKasoff and Bob Wilson had 8<br />\nand 9 points respectively.<br />\nAgainst Gallaudet Hopkins<br />\ncame back late in the game to<br /><br />\nwin by eight. Nikic led the Jays<br />\nwith 22 points and grabbed 17<br />\nrebounds. Clayton scored 19<br />\nand pulled down 18 rebounds.<br />\nBob Wilson chipped in 14<br />\npoints. .According to coach<br />\nDoherty, the Jays did not play<br />\nthat well. \"We missed from the<br />\noutside and it appeared as if we<br />\nhad some first-game jitters.<br />\nAlso, the guys weren't getting<br />\nback on defense.\"<br />\nEven though the Blue Jays<br />\nlost by 43 to Maryland, DohertY was happy with the team's<br />\nplay. \"We only had 15 turnovers: Glen (Wall) dribbled<br />\nwell and Clayton looked good.<br />\nThey were so big and quick.<br />\nThey hit the hoards harder than<br />\nan' team I've seen.\"<br /><br />\nWomen's<br />\nBasketball<br />\ncont. 1/of! p. 14<br />\n1.ar orck\u2022\u2022 \u2018\u2018ho hit 1 our field<br />\ngoals in her 15 minutes of play,<br />\nled Hopkins scorers along with<br />\nKlauber with eight points.<br />\nHirschhorn had seven, while<br />\nSarah liausserman and Celeste<br />\nDel3api isle had three and two,<br />\nrespect] ely.
