The information<br />\nunimaginatively collected and insipidly presented by the<br />\nHAC's ad hoc committee also lacks the saving approbation of<br />\nthe HAC itself! One HAC member was quite surprised to<br />\nknow that such a report was released in the name of the<br />\nCouncil since the panel as a whole had never seen, much less<br />\napproved, the ad hoc committee's earth -shattering magnum<br />\nopus.<br />\n<br />\nGod only knows what naivete allowed the ad hoc<br />\ncommittee to suffer the delusion that the Book Center makes<br />\n\"every attempt to accomodate students and faculty,\" what<br />\nignorance permitted them to think their investigation<br />\ncomplete when its results were so profoundly incompatible<br />\nwith the circumstances. The ad hoc committee polled neither<br />\nstudents nor faculty about the Book Center's services. Nor<br />\ndid they find anything unaccomodating about the Book<br />\nCenter's lack of a true used book service.<br />\nAnd as an added bonus, the committee found its curiosity<br />\nsated with the mere knowledge that the Book Center's<br />\nbookeeping was sound\u2014far be it from the noble inquisitors to<br />\nperhaps investigate whether the Book Center's administration<br />\nis wasteful or not, if their expenditures are impractical or<br />\nfrug4I.<br />\nWe're so sure that the ad hoc committee's investigation has<br />\nthe remedial value of a bed of kelp, that their nice-Nellie<br />\nanalysis is inaccurate, that we're going to conduct our own<br />\ncomparative investigation to be released within two weeks.<br />\nUnlike the HAC's obsequious offering, it will address the<br />\nheart of the matter\u2014how much students have to pay.<br />\n<br />\nletters to the editor<br />\nMcCarthy.<br />\nTo the Editor:<br />\nThirdly, Duvoisin accuses<br />\nNearly everything Marc Duvoisin<br />\n\"viA. \"I'Ike Importance oC Beiny, McGovern of \"incompetence.\" I<br />\nVxxv\u201ewcw.\"<br />\nC\\'\\t\u201814%\\tkkex<br />\n-<br />\n<br />\nr<br />\n<br />\nt/to<br />\n<br />\nBy CRAIG HANKIN<br />\nOne year ago, after seeing Bob<br />\nDylan in concert and listening to<br />\nPlanet Waves (the album hastily recorded prior to the beginning of<br />\nthe tour), I couldn't help but feel<br />\nthat his next studio LP would be a<br />\nwell-crafted work of excellence.<br />\nBlood On The Tracks fulfilled my<br />\nexpectations.<br />\nA friend has referred to Planet<br />\nWaves,in retrospect, as an \"appetizer\" to be enjoyed before the<br />\nhearty feast of Blood On The<br />\nTracks, and in a sense I think he is<br />\nright. Planet Waves (and the ensuing tour) delivered a promise of<br />\nDylan's return as America's most<br />\ncapable storyteller in the oral tradition. Now, after collecting the images and impressions provided by a<br />\nlong trek across the country, Dylan<br />\nis ready to offer his tales,<br />\n\"Tangled Up in Blue\" is .an<br />\nelusive travelogue traversing the<br />\nU.S.(much as Dylan did on tour)<br />\nfrom \"the Great North Woods\" to<br />\nNew Orlehns, from West Coast to<br />\nEast. As in most Dylan tunes of<br />\nthis genre (and there are quite a<br />\nfew on this album), one can only<br />\nguess how many of the details involved are autobiographical. But<br />\nthis hardly matters for the story is<br />\nclassic enough: lovers trying to<br />\nmake it work, failing, parting ways,<br />\nand meeting again in unlikely and<br />\nawkward circumstances. \"But<br />\nwhen we meet again, introduced as<br />\nfriends, please don't let on that<br />\nyou knew me when...\" Dylan manipulates the song beautifully. The<br />\ntempo begins as slowly and as relaxed as the lyrics (\"Early one<br />\nmornin', the sun was shinin', I was<br />\nlayin' in bed...\" Gradually the<br />\npace is stepped up and the rolling,<br />\nirresistable melody confirms how<br />\neasy it is to get so \"tangled up.\"<br />\nThe next cut,\" Simple Twist of<br />\nFate,\" is thematically related to<br />\nthe first, but the narrative process<br />\nundergoes a startling trapsformation. Here we have a nocturnal rendezvous in the city (told in the<br />\nthird person) which quickly moves<br />\nfrom park bench to \"strange<br />\nhotel.\" The male wakes up the<br />\nnext morning alone a la Lennon's<br />\n\"Norwegian Wood\" and goes down<br />\nto the docks to seek her out.

We might well ask the \u2022<br />\nsame about this tune.<br />\nThe shortcomings of \"You're A<br />\nBig Girl Now\" are all but forgotten<br />\nupon hearing one of the album's<br />\ntwo magnum opera, \"Idiot Wind.\"<br />\nThis summer will mark ten years<br />\nsince Dylan penned \"Like A<br />\nRolling Stone,\" his anthem to America's wayward, bourgeois youth.<br />\n\"Idiot Wind\" strongly suggests that<br />\nDylan still has \"Like A Rolling<br />\nStone\" in mind. The new song is<br />\nan eight-minute collage of that<br />\nmid-Sixties vintage including<br />\n\"Sooner or Later (One of Us Must<br />\nKnow),\" \"Positively 4th Street\"<br />\nand a touch of the haunting \"Ballad of a Thin Man.\" Dylan can be<br />\nheard squalling amid the raucous<br />\nproduction which features a tremendous Garth Hudsonesque organ part. Unlike most of the LP's<br />\nother tracks, \"Idiot Wind\" dispenses with any instrumental introduction and leaps right into the problems at hand: the nasty, outrageous stories appearing in the press,<br />\nthe invasion of privacy, relationships broken in a topsy-turvy<br />\nworld of corruption, betrayal by<br />\nonce-trusted friends, etc. Mutiny<br />\nfrom stern to bow.

Which positions<br />\nwere these?The author cites two:<br />\nopposition to the Vietnam War,<br />\nand amnesty. I think it would be<br />\ndifficult to show that public opinion on Vietnam changed much at<br />\nall during or after that campaign<br />\nuntil the U.S. withdrew in January.<br />\nOne might mention Congressional<br />\naction cutting funds for Cambodia<br />\nbombing and present moves to cut<br />\naid to South Vietnam and Cambodia as evidence that, if anything,<br />\nthese positions have become more<br />\nfavored. As for amnesty, it has<br />\ngained in support, in the statemeats of public officials, most<br />\nnotably the President, and in the<br />\nGallup and Harris polls.<br />\nA few other liberal positions can<br />\nbe named, which George<br />\nMcGovern campaigned for: decreased military spending, elimination of certain tax exemptions,<br />\nand :the \"negative income tax\" or<br />\n\"guaranteed annual income.\" Does<br />\nMrs Duvoisin believe that any of<br />\nthese positions are less popular<br />\nthan they were two or three years<br />\nago?If anything, I think that these<br />\nproposals have increased in support<br />\nsince 1972. Sentiment for such<br />\n. measures has certainly increased in<br />\nthe Congress. A notable example<br />\nwould be the recent action of the<br />\nWays and Means Committee on tax<br />\nexemptions.<br />\nSecondly, the author says that<br />\nthese positions may have suffered<br />\nfrom the \"mangled interpretatioas\" of Senator McGovern.<br />\nWhich interpretations were these?<br />\nWithdrawal from Vietnam in 90<br />\ndays? Amnesty for all draft resiste<br />\nter and deserters?Abolition of the<br />\noil depletion allowance, favored<br />\ntax status for capital gains, and<br />\nother loopholes? Perhaps Mr.<br />\nDuvoisin meant McGovern's proposal for a $30-billion reduction in<br />\nmilitary spending. McGovern listed<br />\nthe specific programs that would<br />\nbe cut or reduced, such as troops<br />\nin Europe and Southeast Asia, the<br />\nB-1 bomber, and the Trident submarine. These same reductions<br />\nhave been advocated by most leading liberals, including, presumably,<br />\nEugene McCarthy. Maybe the<br />\nwriter referred to the<br />\n$1000-per-person negative income<br />\ntax. Although McGovern retreated<br />\nfrom that figure, he continued to<br />\nassert the general principal, which<br />\nwas proposed in very similar form<br />\nfour years earlier by one Senator<br />\n<br />\nthattige\u2022he. itfot\u2014a.rt/ky,, ZI7<br />\n.e.S<br />\n.<br />\n.rrt tc<br />\nthe Pr,ch4,1-1,3/<br />\n<br />\nmade very few specific proposals<br />\nfor concrete actions, and was not<br />\nsubject to the kind of scrutiny<br />\nMcGovern was. He also did not<br />\nreceive his party's nomination,<br />\nwhich was the beginning of Senator McGovern's big troubles. A lot<br />\nof people were disturbed by the<br />\npetty bickering Mr. McCarthy's<br />\nsupporters engaged in with Senator<br />\nRobert Kennedy, including statements by McCarthy himself, such<br />\nas his observation at the University<br />\nof Oregon that the more intelligent<br />\nstudents preferred him to<br />\nKennedy. In other words, Duvoisin<br />\nmay be right that McGovern seemed incompetent, but I don't think<br />\nthat is a very good point to make<br />\nin defending. Eugene McCarthy.<br />\nFinally, Mr. Duvoisin goes on at<br />\ngreat lengths attacking compromise, which he seems to regard as<br />\none of the great evils of our political system. Again, I'm not sure<br />\nhow McCarthy stands in favorable<br />\ncontrast here to McGovern. Did<br />\nMcGovern compromise on<br />\nVietnam? On amnesty? On military spending?Taxes and welfare?<br />\nThe Democratic Party platform<br />\nmay have been a bit vague in some<br />\nof these areas(though I would submit it was the least vague-platform<br />\na major party has issued in recent<br />\ntimes, excepting Goldwater's) but<br />\nafter the Convention McGovern issued position papers which stated<br />\nhis positions much more specifically, and they were really little different from what he said before<br />\nthe Convention.<br />\nSenator McCarthy refused to endorse Hubert Humphrey for several<br />\nweeks, which was, I think, admirable. It is not comparable, though<br />\nto something Duvoisin hints at in<br />\nhis article: McGovern's acceptance<br />\nof \"support\", if you can call it<br />\nthat, from Mayor Daley and<br />\nLyndon Johnson. These men are,<br />\nsupposedly, the enemy, and<br />\nMcGovern should have refused to<br />\ntalk with them, thereby alienating<br />\nthem and a large portion of the<br />\nparty even further, and increasing ,<br />\nNixon's margin of victory.<br />\nIt is true that one has to compromise to win an election in this<br />\ncountry.

Suffice it for<br />\nme to say that \"Jack of Hearts\"<br />\nhas its roots in Old Western roundhouse music and is reminiscent of<br />\nthe soundtrack Dylan composed<br />\nfor Pat Garrett and Billy The Kid.'<br />\nYou can't make a move without<br />\nthe Jack of Hearts.<br />\nThe flavor of the Old West is<br />\nsustained in \"If You See Her, Say<br />\nHello.\" But in addition to the obvious Western balladic derivation,<br />\nthere is the feeling one might get<br />\nfrom a show-down between Hank<br />\nWilliams and Frank Sinatra in<br />\nTijuana.

The music to<br />\nthis composition has been heard<br />\nbefore. In 1970, Gordon Lightfoot<br />\npaid tribute to Dylan's \"A Hard<br />\nRain's A-Gonna Fall\" in one of his<br />\nown tunes, \"Sit Down Your<br />\nStranger.\" Here Dylan has taken<br />\nthe chords from Lightfoot's song<br />\nand adapted them for his own use.<br />\nLightfoot is brought to mind<br />\nagain in the album's last cut,<br />\n\"Buckets of Rain.\" However, even<br />\nmore than Lightfoot, you can feel<br />\nthe presence of Doc Watson in the<br />\ncrisp guitarwork and in the perfectly mellow country voice Dylan<br />\nuses in this number:<br />\n<br />\nDave Van Ronk has told the<br />\nstory of how he once asked Dylan<br />\nback in the early Village days if he<br />\nwas familiar with the French<br />\nSymbolist poets.

Despite<br />\ncoming into the Hopkins match<br />\nwith an 0-5 record, American had<br />\na tough lineup. American's losses<br />\ncame against such strong wrestling teams as Hofstra, Bucknell,<br />\nTemple, University of North Carolina and University of Maryland.<br />\nAmerican's lineup was much<br />\n<br />\nlike that of Hopkins, combining<br />\nthe strength and experience of returning veterans mixed with new<br />\nfaces. Their slightly stronger<br />\nteam coupled with a Hopkins forfeit at 157 proved to be the ingredients of the Bluejay defeat.<br />\nStarting off for the Jays, Steve<br />\nLazzaro faced Griff Gosnell at<br />\n118 pounds.

Steve had a tough<br />\ntime breaking off the legs but<br />\nwas able to get a reversal when<br />\nGosnell rode too high allowing<br />\nSteve to muscle him over. The<br />\nthird period saw the two trading<br />\nreversals but Lazzaro was on top<br />\nto stay picking up a point riding<br />\ntime gaining a 7-2 decision.<br />\nLazzaro remains undefeated with<br />\nan 8-0 record.<br />\nAt 126, Ron Pucillo had his<br />\nhands full with Jack McIntyre.<br />\nPucillo moved in front .quickly<br />\nwith a takedown and 2-point predicament in the first period.

Pucillo couldn't counter<br />\nMcIntyre's takedown move and<br />\nfound himself on the bottom.<br />\nBut a determined Pucillo rolled<br />\nthrough with the figure-four<br />\nlocked on him coming up with a<br />\nfour point play.

The information<br />\nunimaginatively collected and insipidly presented by the<br />\nHAC's ad hoc committee also lacks the saving approbation of<br />\nthe HAC itself! One HAC member was quite surprised to<br />\nknow that such a report was released in the name of the<br />\nCouncil since the panel as a whole had never seen, much less<br />\napproved, the ad hoc committee's earth -shattering magnum<br />\nopus.<br /><br />\nGod only knows what naivete allowed the ad hoc<br />\ncommittee to suffer the delusion that the Book Center makes<br />\n\"every attempt to accomodate students and faculty,\" what<br />\nignorance permitted them to think their investigation<br />\ncomplete when its results were so profoundly incompatible<br />\nwith the circumstances. The ad hoc committee polled neither<br />\nstudents nor faculty about the Book Center's services. Nor<br />\ndid they find anything unaccomodating about the Book<br />\nCenter's lack of a true used book service.<br />\nAnd as an added bonus, the committee found its curiosity<br />\nsated with the mere knowledge that the Book Center's<br />\nbookeeping was sound\u2014far be it from the noble inquisitors to<br />\nperhaps investigate whether the Book Center's administration<br />\nis wasteful or not, if their expenditures are impractical or<br />\nfrug4I.<br />\nWe're so sure that the ad hoc committee's investigation has<br />\nthe remedial value of a bed of kelp, that their nice-Nellie<br />\nanalysis is inaccurate, that we're going to conduct our own<br />\ncomparative investigation to be released within two weeks.<br />\nUnlike the HAC's obsequious offering, it will address the<br />\nheart of the matter\u2014how much students have to pay.<br /><br />\nletters to the editor<br />\nMcCarthy.<br />\nTo the Editor:<br />\nThirdly, Duvoisin accuses<br />\nNearly everything Marc Duvoisin<br />\n\"viA. \"I'Ike Importance oC Beiny, McGovern of \"incompetence.\" I<br />\nVxxv\u201ewcw.\"<br />\nC\\'\\t\u201814%\\tkkex<br />\n-<br /><br />\nr<br /><br />\nt/to<br /><br />\nBy CRAIG HANKIN<br />\nOne year ago, after seeing Bob<br />\nDylan in concert and listening to<br />\nPlanet Waves (the album hastily recorded prior to the beginning of<br />\nthe tour), I couldn't help but feel<br />\nthat his next studio LP would be a<br />\nwell-crafted work of excellence.<br />\nBlood On The Tracks fulfilled my<br />\nexpectations.<br />\nA friend has referred to Planet<br />\nWaves,in retrospect, as an \"appetizer\" to be enjoyed before the<br />\nhearty feast of Blood On The<br />\nTracks, and in a sense I think he is<br />\nright. Planet Waves (and the ensuing tour) delivered a promise of<br />\nDylan's return as America's most<br />\ncapable storyteller in the oral tradition. Now, after collecting the images and impressions provided by a<br />\nlong trek across the country, Dylan<br />\nis ready to offer his tales,<br />\n\"Tangled Up in Blue\" is .an<br />\nelusive travelogue traversing the<br />\nU.S.(much as Dylan did on tour)<br />\nfrom \"the Great North Woods\" to<br />\nNew Orlehns, from West Coast to<br />\nEast. As in most Dylan tunes of<br />\nthis genre (and there are quite a<br />\nfew on this album), one can only<br />\nguess how many of the details involved are autobiographical. But<br />\nthis hardly matters for the story is<br />\nclassic enough: lovers trying to<br />\nmake it work, failing, parting ways,<br />\nand meeting again in unlikely and<br />\nawkward circumstances. \"But<br />\nwhen we meet again, introduced as<br />\nfriends, please don't let on that<br />\nyou knew me when...\" Dylan manipulates the song beautifully. The<br />\ntempo begins as slowly and as relaxed as the lyrics (\"Early one<br />\nmornin', the sun was shinin', I was<br />\nlayin' in bed...\" Gradually the<br />\npace is stepped up and the rolling,<br />\nirresistable melody confirms how<br />\neasy it is to get so \"tangled up.\"<br />\nThe next cut,\" Simple Twist of<br />\nFate,\" is thematically related to<br />\nthe first, but the narrative process<br />\nundergoes a startling trapsformation. Here we have a nocturnal rendezvous in the city (told in the<br />\nthird person) which quickly moves<br />\nfrom park bench to \"strange<br />\nhotel.\" The male wakes up the<br />\nnext morning alone a la Lennon's<br />\n\"Norwegian Wood\" and goes down<br />\nto the docks to seek her out. And<br /><br />\nwcai k dem] thatlAcCieNevu appear-<br /><br />\nks where XT)ylau, at his tux-pre-<br /><br />\nstream? We might well ask the \u2022<br />\nsame about this tune.<br />\nThe shortcomings of \"You're A<br />\nBig Girl Now\" are all but forgotten<br />\nupon hearing one of the album's<br />\ntwo magnum opera, \"Idiot Wind.\"<br />\nThis summer will mark ten years<br />\nsince Dylan penned \"Like A<br />\nRolling Stone,\" his anthem to America's wayward, bourgeois youth.<br />\n\"Idiot Wind\" strongly suggests that<br />\nDylan still has \"Like A Rolling<br />\nStone\" in mind. The new song is<br />\nan eight-minute collage of that<br />\nmid-Sixties vintage including<br />\n\"Sooner or Later (One of Us Must<br />\nKnow),\" \"Positively 4th Street\"<br />\nand a touch of the haunting \"Ballad of a Thin Man.\" Dylan can be<br />\nheard squalling amid the raucous<br />\nproduction which features a tremendous Garth Hudsonesque organ part. Unlike most of the LP's<br />\nother tracks, \"Idiot Wind\" dispenses with any instrumental introduction and leaps right into the problems at hand: the nasty, outrageous stories appearing in the press,<br />\nthe invasion of privacy, relationships broken in a topsy-turvy<br />\nworld of corruption, betrayal by<br />\nonce-trusted friends, etc. Mutiny<br />\nfrom stern to bow.

Which positions<br />\nwere these?The author cites two:<br />\nopposition to the Vietnam War,<br />\nand amnesty. I think it would be<br />\ndifficult to show that public opinion on Vietnam changed much at<br />\nall during or after that campaign<br />\nuntil the U.S. withdrew in January.<br />\nOne might mention Congressional<br />\naction cutting funds for Cambodia<br />\nbombing and present moves to cut<br />\naid to South Vietnam and Cambodia as evidence that, if anything,<br />\nthese positions have become more<br />\nfavored. As for amnesty, it has<br />\ngained in support, in the statemeats of public officials, most<br />\nnotably the President, and in the<br />\nGallup and Harris polls.<br />\nA few other liberal positions can<br />\nbe named, which George<br />\nMcGovern campaigned for: decreased military spending, elimination of certain tax exemptions,<br />\nand :the \"negative income tax\" or<br />\n\"guaranteed annual income.\" Does<br />\nMrs Duvoisin believe that any of<br />\nthese positions are less popular<br />\nthan they were two or three years<br />\nago?If anything, I think that these<br />\nproposals have increased in support<br />\nsince 1972. Sentiment for such<br />\n. measures has certainly increased in<br />\nthe Congress. A notable example<br />\nwould be the recent action of the<br />\nWays and Means Committee on tax<br />\nexemptions.<br />\nSecondly, the author says that<br />\nthese positions may have suffered<br />\nfrom the \"mangled interpretatioas\" of Senator McGovern.<br />\nWhich interpretations were these?<br />\nWithdrawal from Vietnam in 90<br />\ndays? Amnesty for all draft resiste<br />\nter and deserters?Abolition of the<br />\noil depletion allowance, favored<br />\ntax status for capital gains, and<br />\nother loopholes? Perhaps Mr.<br />\nDuvoisin meant McGovern's proposal for a $30-billion reduction in<br />\nmilitary spending. McGovern listed<br />\nthe specific programs that would<br />\nbe cut or reduced, such as troops<br />\nin Europe and Southeast Asia, the<br />\nB-1 bomber, and the Trident submarine. These same reductions<br />\nhave been advocated by most leading liberals, including, presumably,<br />\nEugene McCarthy. Maybe the<br />\nwriter referred to the<br />\n$1000-per-person negative income<br />\ntax. Although McGovern retreated<br />\nfrom that figure, he continued to<br />\nassert the general principal, which<br />\nwas proposed in very similar form<br />\nfour years earlier by one Senator<br /><br />\nthattige\u2022he. itfot\u2014a.rt/ky,, ZI7<br />\n.e.S<br />\n.<br />\n.rrt tc<br />\nthe Pr,ch4,1-1,3/<br /><br />\nmade very few specific proposals<br />\nfor concrete actions, and was not<br />\nsubject to the kind of scrutiny<br />\nMcGovern was. He also did not<br />\nreceive his party's nomination,<br />\nwhich was the beginning of Senator McGovern's big troubles. A lot<br />\nof people were disturbed by the<br />\npetty bickering Mr. McCarthy's<br />\nsupporters engaged in with Senator<br />\nRobert Kennedy, including statements by McCarthy himself, such<br />\nas his observation at the University<br />\nof Oregon that the more intelligent<br />\nstudents preferred him to<br />\nKennedy. In other words, Duvoisin<br />\nmay be right that McGovern seemed incompetent, but I don't think<br />\nthat is a very good point to make<br />\nin defending. Eugene McCarthy.<br />\nFinally, Mr. Duvoisin goes on at<br />\ngreat lengths attacking compromise, which he seems to regard as<br />\none of the great evils of our political system. Again, I'm not sure<br />\nhow McCarthy stands in favorable<br />\ncontrast here to McGovern. Did<br />\nMcGovern compromise on<br />\nVietnam? On amnesty? On military spending?Taxes and welfare?<br />\nThe Democratic Party platform<br />\nmay have been a bit vague in some<br />\nof these areas(though I would submit it was the least vague-platform<br />\na major party has issued in recent<br />\ntimes, excepting Goldwater's) but<br />\nafter the Convention McGovern issued position papers which stated<br />\nhis positions much more specifically, and they were really little different from what he said before<br />\nthe Convention.<br />\nSenator McCarthy refused to endorse Hubert Humphrey for several<br />\nweeks, which was, I think, admirable. It is not comparable, though<br />\nto something Duvoisin hints at in<br />\nhis article: McGovern's acceptance<br />\nof \"support\", if you can call it<br />\nthat, from Mayor Daley and<br />\nLyndon Johnson. These men are,<br />\nsupposedly, the enemy, and<br />\nMcGovern should have refused to<br />\ntalk with them, thereby alienating<br />\nthem and a large portion of the<br />\nparty even further, and increasing ,<br />\nNixon's margin of victory.<br />\nIt is true that one has to compromise to win an election in this<br />\ncountry. Some people think that is<br />\ntoo bad. I would submit that it is a<br />\ngood thing, since no one candidate,<br />\nno faction, no party, has a itteadap.,<br />\noly on truth or wisdom or competence, and that certainly includes<br />\nEugene McCarthy.<br />\nSteve Smith<br /><br />\nPeople to!!

The music to<br />\nthis composition has been heard<br />\nbefore. In 1970, Gordon Lightfoot<br />\npaid tribute to Dylan's \"A Hard<br />\nRain's A-Gonna Fall\" in one of his<br />\nown tunes, \"Sit Down Your<br />\nStranger.\" Here Dylan has taken<br />\nthe chords from Lightfoot's song<br />\nand adapted them for his own use.<br />\nLightfoot is brought to mind<br />\nagain in the album's last cut,<br />\n\"Buckets of Rain.\" However, even<br />\nmore than Lightfoot, you can feel<br />\nthe presence of Doc Watson in the<br />\ncrisp guitarwork and in the perfectly mellow country voice Dylan<br />\nuses in this number:<br /><br />\nDave Van Ronk has told the<br />\nstory of how he once asked Dylan<br />\nback in the early Village days if he<br />\nwas familiar with the French<br />\nSymbolist poets.

Comfort<br />\nadmitted that he \"went to bat\"<br />\nfor the two swimmers when he<br /><br />\nlearned that their financial aid<br />\nhad been jeopardized, but denied<br />\nusing it to prevent them from resigning.<br />\n' He also denied having any control over the restoration of their<br />\naid, asserting that he had just<br />\n\"dropped a note to the Financial<br />\nAid Office\" in their support.<br />\nLehmkuhl and Hutchinson, however, said that the speed with<br />\nwhich the situation was reversed<br />\nled them to believe Comfort had<br />\ntampered with their position on<br />\nthe waiting list.<br />\nAdditional reports from other<br />\nmembers of the swim team and<br />\nother teams indicate that influence-wielding by coaches in the<br />\nareas of Financial Aid and Admissions has been\u2014for the past<br />\nseveral years at least\u2014 a basic re-<br /><br />\ncruiting tactic of the Hopkins<br />\nathletic program.<br />\nRudolph, Lehmkuhl,<br />\nHutchinson, and others have<br />\nstated that in many instances financial aid allocations are reduced when an athlete resigns from a<br />\nteam, even though financial assistance is awarded independent of<br />\nparticipation in athletics. One<br />\nswimmer stated frankly that he<br />\ndoubts he could have gained admission to the University if<br />\nComfort had not \"pulled strings<br />\nfor me.\"<br />\nComfort denied exerting any<br />\ninfluence in either area beyond<br />\nmaking rudimentary recommendations. \"There's no way in the<br />\nworld I would do such things,\" ,<br /><br />\nhe said. \"I could never get a kid<br />\ninto Hopkins because he was a<br />\nswimmer. My recommendation is<br />\njust a supporting criterion.\"<br />\nAthletic Director Robert Scott<br />\nsupported Comfort on this point.<br />\n\"The most we ever do is-throw a<br />\npositive word in for our athletes-we tell Admissions or Financial<br />\nAid who we're interested in. All<br />\nwe do is give an input.\"<br />\nConcerning Rudolph's charge,<br />\nScott said, \"His statement is a lie.<br />\nI know Frank Comfort would<br />\nnot do such a thing.\"<br />\nLarry Denton, director of Academic Services, also denied that<br />\nathletes receives any special treatment in Admissions or Financial<br />\nAid. \"We have no athletic schol-<br /><br />\narships here. Coaches ' may let us<br />\nknow who they're intersted in,<br />\nthough.\"<br />\n\"We may take a special look at<br />\nthem, always trying to treat the<br />\nsituation fairly. Favoritism simply isn't our policy.\"<br />\n\"Getting into that game with<br />\nathletics just isn't our way and it<br />\nnever has been,\" Denton continued. \"I review every financial aid<br />\nallocation and I know that those<br />\nfigures aren't tampered with, by<br />\n\" coaches or anyone else.\"<br />\nDenton stressed that all financial assistance allottments at<br />\nHopkins are determined on the<br />\nbasis of need entirely, with no<br />\nconsideration given to the individual abilities of applicants.<br /><br />\nA\u2022 Ggi\u2022 rkEE \u2022 TONIGNI.

It<br />\nwas their last home match of the<br />\nseason and the loss dropped the<br />\ngrappler's record to 6-2. The<br />\nBluejays will face the Towson<br />\nState Tigers away tomorrow<br />\nnight at 6:00 P.M.<br />\nUnlike many of Hopkins pre-<br /><br />\nvious outings with teams not<br />\nquite up the Bluejay caliber, American University proved to be<br />\nformidable challengers. Despite<br />\ncoming into the Hopkins match<br />\nwith an 0-5 record, American had<br />\na tough lineup. American's losses<br />\ncame against such strong wrestling teams as Hofstra, Bucknell,<br />\nTemple, University of North Carolina and University of Maryland.<br />\nAmerican's lineup was much<br /><br />\nlike that of Hopkins, combining<br />\nthe strength and experience of returning veterans mixed with new<br />\nfaces. Their slightly stronger<br />\nteam coupled with a Hopkins forfeit at 157 proved to be the ingredients of the Bluejay defeat.<br />\nStarting off for the Jays, Steve<br />\nLazzaro faced Griff Gosnell at<br />\n118 pounds. Gosnell was a tough<br />\nopponent but was no match for<br />\nLazzaro's strength and ability.<br /><br />\nNEWS-LETTER<br /><br />\nsports<br /><br />\nSteve jumped out to a quick lead<br />\nwith a takedown in the first<br />\nperiod. In the second period<br />\ndown 2-0, Gosnell threw the figure-four on Lazzaro hoping to<br />\nturn him over. Steve had a tough<br />\ntime breaking off the legs but<br />\nwas able to get a reversal when<br />\nGosnell rode too high allowing<br />\nSteve to muscle him over. The<br />\nthird period saw the two trading<br />\nreversals but Lazzaro was on top<br />\nto stay picking up a point riding<br />\ntime gaining a 7-2 decision.<br />\nLazzaro remains undefeated with<br />\nan 8-0 record.<br />\nAt 126, Ron Pucillo had his<br />\nhands full with Jack McIntyre.<br />\nPucillo moved in front .quickly<br />\nwith a takedown and 2-point predicament in the first period. Ron<br />\nwas switched at the start of the<br /><br />\nGary Murza<br />\nsecond period but managed to escape. Pucillo couldn't counter<br />\nMcIntyre's takedown move and<br />\nfound himself on the bottom.<br />\nBut a determined Pucillo rolled<br />\nthrough with the figure-four<br />\nlocked on him coming up with a<br />\nfour point play. He maintained<br />\nhis margin through the final period coming up with an 11-8 decision. -This left Pucillo undefeat. ed at 8-0.<br />\nDown 2-0 after the first period, Clark Kingery was able to<br />\nknot the score at 44 at the end<br />\nof two by gaining a reversal and<br />\nquick predicament at the end of<br />\nthe period.
