In addition to<br />\n<br />\nother facilities, the MPC will<br />\nhouse a full-size gym. All plans<br />\nfor the project are subject to the<br />\napproval of the community.<br />\nLlewellyn Hall, chairman of<br />\nthe community task-force, stated<br />\nthat the total cost of the project<br />\nwould be approximately'<br />\n$500,000. Bids for the<br />\ncontractors will beg solicited in<br />\nOctober, with construction slated<br />\nto begin in October.<br />\nHall said that the building<br />\nshould be completed and ready<br />\nfor occupancy on September 1 of<br />\nnext year, \"if all goes smoothly.\"<br />\nOn the opposite side of the<br />\nPark, community residents have<br />\nalso taken action to revitalize it<br />\nand turn it into a center for<br />\ncommunity activity. \u2022<br />\nCitizens of the<br />\nRemington -Charles Village<br />\ncommunity have formed the<br />\nWyman Park Dell Committee, a<br />\ngroup dedicated to improving the<br />\npark and providing entertainment.<br />\nThe Committee sponsored a<br />\nconcert in the Dell this past<br />\nSunday featuring the Peabody<br />\nRagtime Ensemble.<br />\n<br />\nCHIP to improve schooling of sick students<br />\nBy RUSS SMITH<br />\nAlmost sixty Baltimore school<br />\nchildren who are plagued with<br />\nchronic illnesses are now<br />\nreceiving an expanded program<br />\nof home and hospital teaching<br />\nduring their absence from school.<br />\nThe Chronic Health Impaired<br />\nProgram (CHIP), directed by<br />\nFrances Bateson and Mrs. Nancy<br />\nRini, serves local grade school<br />\nstudents who suffer from<br />\nailments such as diabetes,<br />\nasthma, and heart disorders.<br />\nAssistance<br />\nPreviously, only children who<br />\nwere absent from school for six<br />\nweeks or more were eligible for<br />\neducational assistance in the<br />\nhome or hospital. Those with<br />\nerrant health problems often<br />\nmissed a substantial portion of<br />\nthe school year, though each<br />\nillness was not long enough to<br />\nqualify the student for home<br />\nteaching.<br />\n<br />\nCHIP, which started this<br />\nmonth, was conceived by the<br />\nArea for Exceptional Children, a<br />\ndivision of the Baltimore City<br />\nPublic Schools. Financed by local<br />\neducational funds, the program is<br />\nopen to those who attend both<br />\npublic and private facilities. The<br />\nsole stipulation is that the child's<br />\nparents reside in Baltimore.<br />\nStudents with chronic illnesses<br />\nare referred to CHIP by health<br />\nagencies, hospitals, and<br />\npediatricians.<br />\nThe staff of 28 qualified<br />\nteachers, in addition to a pool of<br />\ntwo hundred part-time<br />\ninstructors, is assigned to a<br />\npatient's home or hospital.<br />\n<br />\nContinuity_<br />\nUsually, the teachers are from<br />\nthe disabled student's current<br />\nschool so that educational<br />\ncontinuity can be maintained.<br />\nIn this way children who are<br />\nabsent from school less than six<br />\n<br />\nweeks at a time are able to<br />\ncomplete their studies while<br />\nremaining on the school rolls.<br />\nThose who miss more than six<br />\nweeks are transferred to the<br />\nHome teaching attendence<br />\nregisters.<br />\nSCAP<br />\nAlthough only a few weeks<br />\nold, CHIP is expanding daily as<br />\nparents discover that their infirm<br />\nchildren, once somewhat<br />\nneglected, are eligible to receive<br />\nassistance.<br />\nUnder the same aegis as CHIP<br />\nis the Sickle Cell Anemia<br />\nProgram (SCAP), supervised by<br />\nPriscilla Hawkins.<br />\nSCAP, funded by a $50,000<br />\nfederal grant awarded in July,<br />\n1974, serves approximately 150<br />\nsickle cell victims. SCAP operates<br />\nin the same manner as CHIP,<br />\nsending teachers to homes and<br />\nhospitals.<br />\nLike sufferers of chronic<br />\n<br />\nillness, those with sickle cell<br />\nanemia rarely miss more than six<br />\nweeks of school at one stretch,<br />\nalthough their attendance is<br />\nsporadic throughout the<br />\nacademic year. According to<br />\nBateson, children with the<br />\ndisease are sometimes less mature<br />\nand slower to develop than their<br />\nclassmates, and, for this reason,<br />\nneed the attention that SCAP<br />\nprovides.<br />\n'Additional Aid<br />\nThis year, SCAP was Oven an<br />\nadditional $21,000 by the federal<br />\ngovernment, most of which will<br />\nbe used to enlarge the staff and<br />\nestablish sickle cell workshops.<br />\n<br />\nRecycling centers unsuccessful at JHU<br />\nBy ERIC SCHWARTZ<br />\nHopkins has been unable to<br />\nmaintain a recycling center in<br />\nrecent years due to a lack of<br />\ncontinuing student interest and<br />\nfinancial support.<br />\nIn the past few years, three<br />\nindependent groups have tried to<br />\nstart a recycling center.

But as<br />\nthe trend goes, so goes<br />\nHopkins\u2014a realization which<br />\nshould give us cause for concern<br />\nwhen contemplating the future<br />\nof higher education.

Colleges and<br />\nUniversities exist in but a ghost<br />\nof their former abundance. There<br />\nare, in fact, only three private<br />\ninstitutions remaining on the<br />\nEast Coast\u2014Hopkins, Yale and<br />\nHarvard.

Only<br />\ntwo undergraduates are enrolled<br />\nbecause only two could afford<br />\nthe fees\u2014J. Cameron Reynolds,<br />\naluminum foil heir, and Winslow<br />\nRockefeller. The University itself<br />\nhas undergone significant changes<br />\nto survive in these grave<br />\neconomic circumstances. The<br />\nadministration, as we know it<br />\nnow, no longer exists due to the<br />\nextensive cutbacks. The<br />\nUniversity's policy decisions are<br />\nmade by a four-man junta<br />\ncomposed of President Muller,<br />\nLarry Denton, George Benton,<br />\nHarry Woolf; they plan to remain<br />\nin power until the Board of<br />\nTrustee (of the original 60 only<br />\nR.D.H.

Garland Hall, now empty<br />\nof administrators, has been sold<br />\nto the Ramada Inn Corp. and<br />\nrenamed The Ramada Gar-Land.<br />\nThis transaction, along with the<br />\nsale of the Ratliskellar's dome<br />\nand wooden dance floor to the<br />\nBeirut Hilton, were undertaken<br />\nto accrue some \"indirect cost<br />\nrecoveries.\"<br />\nYet the University is coping<br />\nwith the hard times, though<br />\n<br />\ncatastrophe continues to impend.<br />\nOne day, both Hopkins<br />\nundergraduates get together in<br />\nwhat remains of the Rat.

The case floundered in<br />\nlegal argot for several weeks and<br />\na fiery argument ensued among<br />\nthe lawyers as to whether Eric<br />\nClapton played \"acid rock\"<br />\nmusic or country music. One of<br />\nthe neighborhood leaders<br />\nrevealed to the press that he<br />\nhimself had played in a band<br />\nspecializing in Bill Haley and the<br />\nComets music, and could surely<br />\naffirm that the music Eric<br />\nClapton played was acid rock.<br />\nNot too long after that the court<br />\ndecided to back the promoters<br />\nand the show was to take place as<br />\nannounced.<br />\nI took off work on July 3, the<br />\nday of the concert, and treked<br />\ndown to the stadium in the early<br />\nMorning hours. Seeing Clapton<br />\npull up in a taxi that morning in<br />\na t-shirt and Schlitz sun visor gave<br />\nme strength. However, five hours<br />\nlater, just before the concert was<br />\nto have begun, the sky grew dark<br />\nand grey. One hell of a storm<br />\npassed over the area with<br />\ntremendous gusts of wind. The<br />\n<br />\nsound system was knocked out in<br />\nseconds. It announced that the<br />\nconcert was cancelled, and after a<br />\nlittle shouting, a little<br />\nbottle-throwing, and a lot of<br />\ncursing, thousands of disgruntled<br />\nfans were turned away from the<br />\nstadium gates to head home<br />\n$8.50 poorer. To those of you<br />\nstill awaiting your refunds,<br />\nrejoice in the fact that Clapton's<br />\nnew live album \"E.C. Was Here,\"<br />\nhas just been released. \"It's the<br />\nnext best thing to being there.\"<br />\nGoofed<br />\nAfter reading several reviews<br />\nof the album, I borrowed it from<br />\na friend. As I listened, something<br />\nbothered me. Two tracks later I<br />\nknew what it was. That feeling of<br />\ndeja vu which always proceeds<br />\nthe all-too-familiar realization<br />\nthat they goofed, was in the air.<br />\nThey blew it! Those insensitive<br />\ngoggly-eyed ghouls from Rolling<br />\nStone muffed it again. \"...The<br />\nclassic Clapton album;\" they had<br />\nsaid. Well, I certainly wouldn't<br />\ntake it that far. \"E.C. Was Here\"<br />\nis not Clapton's Magnum opus.<br />\nHis music with Derek and the<br />\nDominoes is in many ways<br />\nsuperior to this album, although<br />\nthe musical genre there is closer<br />\nto rock than blues. On the<br />\n\"Layla\" album for instance,<br />\nClapton's compositional and<br />\nsinging talents reach full flower,<br />\nand with brilliant slide and<br />\nsecond lead guitar from Duane<br />\nAllman..., well that's a tough<br />\ncombination to beat. With the<br />\nexception of a splendid version<br />\nDf \"Rambling on My Mind\"(the<br />\nfirst recorded lead vocal by<br />\n<br />\nClapton from his John Mayall<br />\ndays) the innovative high<br />\nintensity jamming 'of Cream is<br />\nmore stimulating than the<br />\njamming on \"E.C...\" The<br />\njamming on the new album is still<br />\nstrong enough, though, to rivet<br />\none's attention through long<br />\nmusical progressions.<br />\nWell polished<br />\nThe band presently backing<br />\nClapton is excellent\u2014maybe the<br />\ntightest Clapton has played with<br />\nso far. Yvonne Elliman, who also<br />\ndisplayed her talents in the<br />\nBroadway hit \"Jesus Christ<br />\nSuperstar,\" has a polished voice<br />\nthat is extremely well-suited for<br />\nduets with Clapton. One of ,the<br />\nmajor let-downs of -\"E.C...\" is<br />\nthat so little is heard from<br />\nElliman, the unsung heroine of<br />\nthe band. George Terry, who<br />\nplays the second guitar on the<br />\nalbum, knows where he belongs<br />\non stage, and plays his role to<br />\nperfection without straying too<br />\nfar at any time. Dick Sims-organ,<br />\nJamie Oldaker\u2014drums, and the<br />\nunsinkable Carl Radle\u2014bass,<br />\ncomprise the rest of a very<br />\nrelaxed band. This faceless group<br />\nof musicians play as a single unit<br />\nwith no individual trying to steal<br />\nthe show. Clapton has<br />\nmaintained his versatility with<br />\nthis band\u2014even broadened it.<br />\nFrom blues to reggae, to R.&B.,<br />\nto mainstream rock n' roll, this<br />\nband handles its music with the<br />\npoise, unpretentiousness, and<br />\nnon-theatrical form that are<br />\nClapton's trademarks.<br />\nOne would be remiss in<br />\nlabeling \"E.C...\" as \"a return to<br />\n<br />\nthe strict blues form,\" as does<br />\nRolling Stone, without observing<br />\ncertain nuances, and even<br />\nobvious changes, in Clapton's<br />\nstyle of blues-playing. Well,<br />\npardon the heresy, but the<br />\nfailure of the Gospel according to<br />\nRolling Stone to discern<br />\nimportant distinctions is<br />\nperplexing. The rigid structure of<br />\nClapton's natal blues-work has<br />\nbeen reshaped. From the speed<br />\nriffs in \"Have 'You Even Loved a<br />\nWoman,\" which could make<br />\nAlvin Lee blush, to the crisp<br />\nacoustic lead in \"Drifting Blues,\"<br />\none notices a fresh accent. The<br />\nnovel Clapton-Elliman duet on<br />\n\"Presence of the Lord,\"<br />\nhighlighted by a sudden break in<br />\nthe music as they harmonize on<br />\nthe verse \"Everybody knows the<br />\nsecret...,\" also has no ancestry.<br />\nHowever, the up-tempo break on<br />\nthe Blind Faith version of the<br />\nsong is more arousing than this<br />\none.<br />\nBest?<br />\nEric Clapton has come full<br />\ncircle musically. \"E.C...\" has a<br />\nvery lucid message: Eric Clapton<br />\nis a blues guitarist first and<br />\nforemost. The influence of Blind<br />\nFaith, Delaney and Bonnie,<br />\nDerek and the Dominoes, and<br />\nothers is visible on \"E.C...\" But<br />\nClapton sings the blues from the<br />\nsame torn heart and with the<br />\nsame genuine feeling.<br />\n\"E.C. Was Here\" is not<br />\nClapton's best album to date, but<br />\nif you like either Clapton or<br />\nblues, and the two are often<br />\nsynonymous you'd do well to<br />\nget it.<br />\n<br />\n\fpage 8/news-letter/september 19, 1975'<br />\n<br />\nWITCHCRAFT AND MAGICK<br />\n<br />\n30<br />\n18.<br />\nREADING<br />\n<br />\nNoma Scott<br />\nWedneaday, 6:30 p.m.<br />\n<br />\nBICYCLE COMMUTING, MAINTENANCE ANDIGURING<br />\nHOW TO GET AROUND TOWN WITH EASE AND SAFETY<br />\n<br />\n6.<br />\n<br />\nJoe Gardiner<br />\nSunday, 7:00 p.m.<br />\n<br />\nTHE ROOTS OF BLUEGRASS<br />\n<br />\n19<br />\n<br />\nA course on the history of Bluegrass music from the 1920. to the<br />\npresent.

Those with<br />\nerrant health problems often<br />\nmissed a substantial portion of<br />\nthe school year, though each<br />\nillness was not long enough to<br />\nqualify the student for home<br />\nteaching.<br /><br />\nCHIP, which started this<br />\nmonth, was conceived by the<br />\nArea for Exceptional Children, a<br />\ndivision of the Baltimore City<br />\nPublic Schools. Financed by local<br />\neducational funds, the program is<br />\nopen to those who attend both<br />\npublic and private facilities.

The Baltimore<br />\ntradition of hard-headed realism,<br />\nwhich he internalized, goes back<br />\na long way. I have dealt in<br />\nprevious articles with the way<br />\nBaltimoreans learned to<br />\ndistinguish illusion from reality.<br />\nThey learned the hard way that<br />\nthe great myths were so much<br />\nbunkum\u2014that Washington was<br />\nFalstaffian enough to save his<br />\nown hide at Long Island (\"the<br />\nbetter part of valor is<br />\ndiscretion\"); that \"one man,<br />\nmany votes\" is a good axiom for<br />\nwinning elections; that Honest<br />\nAbe knew his Machiavelli and<br />\napplied it.

What<br />\nadmire most about Henry<br />\nMencken is the fact that he wrote<br />\nthe most beautiful invective ever<br />\nproduced by the wit of man. No<br />\ndoubt about it\u2014he was the King.<br />\nDon't take my word for it.

I don't even want'to<br />\nquote his best lines here (there<br />\nwere too many of them, for one<br />\nthing); it would spoil the surprise<br />\nfor you.<br />\nLike - Mark Twain, his only<br />\npeer among America's great<br />\ni conoclasts, Mencken was<br />\nan<br />\nintellectual who had the knack of<br />\ncasting himself in the role of<br />\nanti-intellectual in order to<br />\nentertain, to provoke, to<br />\nembarrass, and to enlighten the<br />\nmasses as well as the elite.<br />\nMencken was a crusader against<br />\nAmerica's twin betes noires,<br />\nIgnorance and Respectability,<br />\nthat powerful coalition that<br />\ncontinues to rule the nation (alas,<br />\ndespite his efforts). Mencken<br />\ntook them all on: the Klu Klux<br />\nKlan; the fundamentalists; the<br />\nobscurantists; the literary snobs;<br />\nthe crooked hack politicians; the<br />\n(equally dangerous) unstable,<br />\nidealist \"statesmen.\" His<br />\nc\u2018overage of the Scopes<br />\nMonkey\" Trial in Dayton,<br />\nTennessee in 1925 and his<br />\ndispatches from the three-ring<br />\ncircuses called political<br />\nc onventions (he covered just<br />\nabout every one of them from<br />\nthe turn of the century until his<br />\ndeath in 1955) are masterpieces<br />\nof wit and common sense. And it<br />\nWas his Baltimore environment<br />\nthat allowed him to do it. Let me<br />\ntry to explain Mencken's debt to<br />\nhis native city.<br />\nMencken was born on Hollins<br />\nStreet in southwest Baltimore<br />\nand he never saw any reason to<br />\nleave it. His father, August, a<br />\ncigar-maker, was contemptuous<br />\nof the local beer. He served it to<br />\ntradesmen but never to guests or<br />\nto his own family. Henry<br />\nattended Baltimore Polytechnic<br />\nInstitute, a public high school<br />\nstill in business at another<br />\nlocation, which . likes to think of<br />\nitself as a prestigious<br />\nengineering-oriented Crystal<br />\nPalace of rationalism.

The case floundered in<br />\nlegal argot for several weeks and<br />\na fiery argument ensued among<br />\nthe lawyers as to whether Eric<br />\nClapton played \"acid rock\"<br />\nmusic or country music. One of<br />\nthe neighborhood leaders<br />\nrevealed to the press that he<br />\nhimself had played in a band<br />\nspecializing in Bill Haley and the<br />\nComets music, and could surely<br />\naffirm that the music Eric<br />\nClapton played was acid rock.<br />\nNot too long after that the court<br />\ndecided to back the promoters<br />\nand the show was to take place as<br />\nannounced.<br />\nI took off work on July 3, the<br />\nday of the concert, and treked<br />\ndown to the stadium in the early<br />\nMorning hours. Seeing Clapton<br />\npull up in a taxi that morning in<br />\na t-shirt and Schlitz sun visor gave<br />\nme strength. However, five hours<br />\nlater, just before the concert was<br />\nto have begun, the sky grew dark<br />\nand grey. One hell of a storm<br />\npassed over the area with<br />\ntremendous gusts of wind. The<br /><br />\nsound system was knocked out in<br />\nseconds. It announced that the<br />\nconcert was cancelled, and after a<br />\nlittle shouting, a little<br />\nbottle-throwing, and a lot of<br />\ncursing, thousands of disgruntled<br />\nfans were turned away from the<br />\nstadium gates to head home<br />\n$8.50 poorer. To those of you<br />\nstill awaiting your refunds,<br />\nrejoice in the fact that Clapton's<br />\nnew live album \"E.C. Was Here,\"<br />\nhas just been released. \"It's the<br />\nnext best thing to being there.\"<br />\nGoofed<br />\nAfter reading several reviews<br />\nof the album, I borrowed it from<br />\na friend. As I listened, something<br />\nbothered me. Two tracks later I<br />\nknew what it was. That feeling of<br />\ndeja vu which always proceeds<br />\nthe all-too-familiar realization<br />\nthat they goofed, was in the air.<br />\nThey blew it! Those insensitive<br />\ngoggly-eyed ghouls from Rolling<br />\nStone muffed it again. \"...The<br />\nclassic Clapton album;\" they had<br />\nsaid. Well, I certainly wouldn't<br />\ntake it that far. \"E.C. Was Here\"<br />\nis not Clapton's Magnum opus.<br />\nHis music with Derek and the<br />\nDominoes is in many ways<br />\nsuperior to this album, although<br />\nthe musical genre there is closer<br />\nto rock than blues. On the<br />\n\"Layla\" album for instance,<br />\nClapton's compositional and<br />\nsinging talents reach full flower,<br />\nand with brilliant slide and<br />\nsecond lead guitar from Duane<br />\nAllman..., well that's a tough<br />\ncombination to beat. With the<br />\nexception of a splendid version<br />\nDf \"Rambling on My Mind\"(the<br />\nfirst recorded lead vocal by<br /><br />\nClapton from his John Mayall<br />\ndays) the innovative high<br />\nintensity jamming 'of Cream is<br />\nmore stimulating than the<br />\njamming on \"E.C...\" The<br />\njamming on the new album is still<br />\nstrong enough, though, to rivet<br />\none's attention through long<br />\nmusical progressions.<br />\nWell polished<br />\nThe band presently backing<br />\nClapton is excellent\u2014maybe the<br />\ntightest Clapton has played with<br />\nso far. Yvonne Elliman, who also<br />\ndisplayed her talents in the<br />\nBroadway hit \"Jesus Christ<br />\nSuperstar,\" has a polished voice<br />\nthat is extremely well-suited for<br />\nduets with Clapton. One of ,the<br />\nmajor let-downs of -\"E.C...\" is<br />\nthat so little is heard from<br />\nElliman, the unsung heroine of<br />\nthe band. George Terry, who<br />\nplays the second guitar on the<br />\nalbum, knows where he belongs<br />\non stage, and plays his role to<br />\nperfection without straying too<br />\nfar at any time. Dick Sims-organ,<br />\nJamie Oldaker\u2014drums, and the<br />\nunsinkable Carl Radle\u2014bass,<br />\ncomprise the rest of a very<br />\nrelaxed band. This faceless group<br />\nof musicians play as a single unit<br />\nwith no individual trying to steal<br />\nthe show. Clapton has<br />\nmaintained his versatility with<br />\nthis band\u2014even broadened it.<br />\nFrom blues to reggae, to R.&amp;B.,<br />\nto mainstream rock n' roll, this<br />\nband handles its music with the<br />\npoise, unpretentiousness, and<br />\nnon-theatrical form that are<br />\nClapton's trademarks.<br />\nOne would be remiss in<br />\nlabeling \"E.C...\" as \"a return to<br /><br />\nthe strict blues form,\" as does<br />\nRolling Stone, without observing<br />\ncertain nuances, and even<br />\nobvious changes, in Clapton's<br />\nstyle of blues-playing. Well,<br />\npardon the heresy, but the<br />\nfailure of the Gospel according to<br />\nRolling Stone to discern<br />\nimportant distinctions is<br />\nperplexing. The rigid structure of<br />\nClapton's natal blues-work has<br />\nbeen reshaped. From the speed<br />\nriffs in \"Have 'You Even Loved a<br />\nWoman,\" which could make<br />\nAlvin Lee blush, to the crisp<br />\nacoustic lead in \"Drifting Blues,\"<br />\none notices a fresh accent. The<br />\nnovel Clapton-Elliman duet on<br />\n\"Presence of the Lord,\"<br />\nhighlighted by a sudden break in<br />\nthe music as they harmonize on<br />\nthe verse \"Everybody knows the<br />\nsecret...,\" also has no ancestry.<br />\nHowever, the up-tempo break on<br />\nthe Blind Faith version of the<br />\nsong is more arousing than this<br />\none.<br />\nBest?<br />\nEric Clapton has come full<br />\ncircle musically. \"E.C...\" has a<br />\nvery lucid message: Eric Clapton<br />\nis a blues guitarist first and<br />\nforemost. The influence of Blind<br />\nFaith, Delaney and Bonnie,<br />\nDerek and the Dominoes, and<br />\nothers is visible on \"E.C...\" But<br />\nClapton sings the blues from the<br />\nsame torn heart and with the<br />\nsame genuine feeling.<br />\n\"E.C. Was Here\" is not<br />\nClapton's best album to date, but<br />\nif you like either Clapton or<br />\nblues, and the two are often<br />\nsynonymous you'd do well to<br />\nget it.<br /><br />\npage 8/news-letter/september 19, 1975'<br /><br />\nWITCHCRAFT AND MAGICK<br /><br />\n30<br />\n18.<br />\nREADING<br /><br />\nNoma Scott<br />\nWedneaday, 6:30 p.m.<br /><br />\nBICYCLE COMMUTING, MAINTENANCE ANDIGURING<br />\nHOW TO GET AROUND TOWN WITH EASE AND SAFETY<br /><br />\n6.<br /><br />\nJoe Gardiner<br />\nSunday, 7:00 p.m.<br /><br />\nTHE ROOTS OF BLUEGRASS<br /><br />\n19<br /><br />\nA course on the history of Bluegrass music from the 1920. to the<br />\npresent.
