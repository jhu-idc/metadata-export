It is far<br />\nIrout our desire to over-emphasize<br />\nthe importance of the work which<br />\nJohns Hopkins has done during<br />\nthe war. We cannot, however, fail<br />\nto remember that the President of<br />\nthe United States, ex officio Commander-in-Chief of our army and<br />\nnavy, is an alumnus of the University, and that the Secretary of<br />\nWar is also an alumnus. No man<br />\nrepresenting our country in diplomatic work during the trying days<br />\nof the war had more. serious responsibilities than the late Walter<br />\nH. Page, Ambassador to Great<br />\nBritain, and no one met responsibilities more conscientiously and<br />\nefficiently. We, of course, all know<br />\nthat Walter H. Page once held a<br />\nfellowship in our University.<br />\nFrom the faculty of Johns Hopkins University came the heads of<br />\nthe Medical afid Surgical Departments of the A. E. F. We have<br />\nreference, of course, to Dr. Thayer<br />\nand Dr. Finney. Dr. Welch's modesty will never succeed in concealing the importance of the work<br />\nwhich he did during the war for<br />\nour country. Dr. Young and Dr.<br />\nBaer are among the many Johns<br />\nHopkins men whose services in<br />\nFrance were invaluable.<br />\nAll of us are grateful for the<br />\nwork which these men have done.<br />\nWe want to meet those of our<br />\nalumni who are returning from<br />\nthe war, especially those who are<br />\nwounded and suffering from<br />\nstrains,\u2022 and it is the desire of<br />\nevery Johns Hopkins man or woman to join in the memorial exercises to those who have been left<br />\nbehind in Flanders Field. Possibly some Of us may, however, be<br />\ninclined to feel that a later opportunity may be more suitable to do<br />\nthese things. If such is the case,<br />\nwe must convince you that you are<br />\nwrong.

We do not think it necessary to urge the undergraduates<br />\nto be present. They must realize<br />\nwhat a magnificent effort is being<br />\nmade by the alumni to honor<br />\nJohns Hopkins and what a wonderful opportunity it offers them of<br />\njoining with former undergraduates to de her honor.<br />\nThe program, published in this<br />\nissue, contains elaborate, interesting entertainment, not only for<br />\nthe alumni, but for the present<br />\nstudent body.

Today the<br />\neditor asks me to tell briefly how<br />\nthe system has worked. I am glad<br />\nto be able to say that in my judgment it has worked admirably and<br />\nhas fulfilled the hopes of those<br />\npublic-spirited students who took<br />\nthe initiative in establishing it. It<br />\nis not, of course, one hundred per<br />\ncent. elicient. Not every student<br />\nhas the ... strength of character<br />\nwhich the honor system presupposes, and it is possible that the<br />\nhonor pledge is sometimes misused. But I am'convinced that<br />\nsuch cases are extremely rare; far<br />\nmore rare than the evasions of<br />\nsupervision that take place in colleges where the instructor polices<br />\nthe examination room. Moreover,<br />\nthe honor system produces a spirit<br />\nof mutual confidence between faculty and students and a sense of<br />\nresponsibility in the leaders of<br />\nstudent opinion which are worth<br />\na great deal. The Student Councils of the past few years have<br />\nhad some difficult tasks. It has<br />\nbeen necessary for them to bring<br />\noffenders to trial, to sift evidence,<br />\nand to reach a verdict which involved the dismissal of the culprit<br />\nfrom college. I have been present<br />\nat. some of these trials, and have<br />\nbeen much impressed by the dignity and seriousness of the proceedings and by the justice of the<br />\ndecisions. I can recall no recommendation made by such a student<br />\ncourt to the Dean that was not at<br />\nonce given his official sanction. It<br />\nis a part of the Hopkins system<br />\nthat the actions of the Student<br />\nCouncil in such matters are not<br />\nmade public. They are, however,<br />\nreported to a committee of the<br />\nfaculty, which co-operates closely with the Council. It is fair to<br />\nsay that since the adoption of the<br />\nnot a great<br />\nsystem a number<br />\nnumber, happily\u2014of students have<br />\nbeen tried by their fellows, and<br />\nthat some, having been proved<br />\nguilty, have been advised by the<br />\nCouncil to leave Homewood at<br />\nonce. A student who did not wish<br />\nto accept this verdict was entitled<br />\nto a trial by the Dean and the<br />\nCommittee on Student Affairs;<br />\nbut no defendant has ever challenged the student sentence. I do<br />\nnot wish to imply that the system is largely a matter of compulsion. For the most part, it enforces itself. I do, however, wish<br />\nto assure alumni that student selfgovernment at Hopkins is a reality and that when occasion arises<br />\nit governs.<br />\n<br />\nGiven Dance by the Beauty of the<br />\nTown\u2014Entertained Royally by<br />\ntheir Hostesses.<br />\n<br />\nOn last Saturday evening, the<br />\nJohns Hopkins Glee Club, about<br />\nthirty strong, journeyed to Rockville and presented a program of<br />\ngreat harmony and variety.

Shortly afterwards<br />\nhe told us to go ahead. Shuter,<br />\n'97, became business manager of<br />\nthe enterprise; Edgeworth Smith,<br />\npoet, musician and one of the<br />\nmost gifted and lovable fellows in<br />\nthe world, gave the paper the<br />\nname, NEWS-LETTER, and the new<br />\nenterprise was launched.<br />\nSmith is engaged in selling real<br />\nestate on Long Island. Shuter, I<br />\nunderstand, died in the Philippine<br />\nWar. But the paper has lived,<br />\nand ik now an old venture as<br />\npapers go. It has grown and improved. Our successors have done<br />\nbetter than we did, but none of<br />\nthem could possibly have taken<br />\ntheir work more seriously or have<br />\nloved the venture more than those<br />\nof us who started it.<br />\nThe Hopkins has always been a<br />\ngreat institution.

In the midst of triumph,<br />\njoy and good food, the freshmen<br />\nheld their banquet last Thursday<br />\nevening. Why the triumph? Why<br />\nbecause the sophs had lost the lacrosse game that afternoon, the<br />\nfreshmen having won by the score<br />\nof 3 to 0. Why the joy? Because<br />\nas a result of the game the freshman regulations were \"null and<br />\nvoid.\" They would have been over<br />\nin .a few days anyhow, but that<br />\nmade no difference in the festivities. The sophs had been beaten<br />\nin lacrosse and baseball, and now<br />\n*was the time to celebrate.<br />\nThe banquet was held at the<br />\nLog Inn, which is about five miles,<br />\nfrom the Annapolis road. For the<br />\nfirst half hour everyone was too<br />\nbusy eating to think of much else.<br />\nThen cigarettes were lighted and<br />\nthe speeches began.

A special featuer will be the unveiling of a<br />\nmemorial tablet to the Hopkins<br />\nmen who have lost their lives in<br />\nthe war. The memorial address<br />\nwill be made by one of our bestknown graduates, Hon. Newton D.<br />\nBaker. In addition to this, there<br />\nwill be a banquet in which members of each class will be seated<br />\nseparately, but in which all the<br />\ntables will be in the same room,<br />\nso that we will combine not only<br />\nthe special features of a class reunion, but the broad stimulating<br />\nfeatures of a general reunion of<br />\nall Hopkins men.<br />\nThere will be various luncheons<br />\nfor the various classes; a general<br />\nsmoker for all the returned alumni, and, while there will be no special exercises for the medical graduates, as the general medical reunion will take place next year,<br />\nnevertheless it will be a good opportunity for them to revisit the<br />\nhospital and see the great changes<br />\nwhich have taken place in the past<br />\nfew years, while at the same time,<br />\nthey will be able to renew associations with their old friends who<br />\nhave returned for this reunion.<br />\nIt is, therefore, much to be<br />\nhoped that all the medical men<br />\nwill make a special effort to be<br />\npresent at this reunion, so that<br />\nthe medical side of the University<br />\nwill be proportionately as well<br />\nrepresented as the mind ergra<br />\nand post-graduate departments.<br />\nfreshman lacrosse team, made a<br />\nhumorous speech, sprinkled with<br />\nplenty of jokes of the well-known<br />\nWilliams brand.

Other speeches were<br />\ngiven by Tome, Norwood, Lipps,<br />\nOwens and others. In the midst<br />\nof the speech-making, Allen came<br />\nin with the announcement that 10<br />\nautomobiles laden with sophs had<br />\ngone out to the Suburban.

The games were<br />\nmore than a success. The track<br />\nwas in first-class condition, giving<br />\nmore than 350 athletes, representing 19 schools, an opportunity to<br />\ntry out their ability. The showing<br />\nof the boys representing Tome,<br />\nGilman, Poly, City and Central<br />\nHigh School of Washington was<br />\nespecially good. Joe Thompson,<br />\nof Poly, ran a beautiful race in<br />\nthe 220 hurdles,, and Kirkpatric,<br />\nCity's captain, finished a close second in an exceptionally fast quarter. These two boys are looking<br />\nforward to being members of the<br />\nHopkins squad next year, and<br />\nwith a little more training and<br />\nexperience they should show up<br />\nwell in collegiate competition.<br />\n\u2022 The big surprise of the day was<br />\nthe showing made by Friends<br />\nSchool, the Quakers landing a<br />\nnumber of first places, and finishing third in the standing, with<br />\n48 points.<br />\nThe only detracting feature was<br />\nthe poor attendance. The lack of<br />\nspectators, however, did not prevent the contestants from working<br />\nat their best, and people who remained away missed a treat.<br />\n<br />\nFRESHMEN NOSE OUT SOPHS<br />\nTake Advantage of Errors of 1921 Club<br />\n\u2014Trew Stars for Sophs; Wood<br />\nfor the Freshmen.<br />\n<br />\nIN THE MEN'S STORE\u2014<br />\nNeckwear in wonderful variety; patterns galore!<br />\n<br />\nFrom a close, hard-fought pitchers' duel, the fresmen emerged the<br />\nvictor last Monday, 4-3.

The speaker<br />\nbriefly \u2022traced the history of trade<br />\nunions from their origin up to<br />\ntheir present status. Exclusive of<br />\nthe old Roman working men<br />\nunions and the English guilds of<br />\nseveral centuries back, Mr. Ferguson stated that the beginning<br />\nof a real trade union came with<br />\nthe organization of the Knights of<br />\nLabor. From this latter body the<br />\npresent American Federation of<br />\nLabor has grown.<br />\nThe American Federation of Labor has at present about three and<br />\none-half million members in the<br />\nUnited States, including skilled<br />\nand unskilled workihgtnen. The<br />\nspeaker also remarked, in reference to the radicalism of trade<br />\nunions, that all great movements<br />\nin the past have been radical ones,<br />\nand that all great men have been<br />\nmore or less radical in their convictions, and surely trade unions<br />\nwould not deny such a compliment.<br />\nTrade unions are a living protest against the present social conditions that destroy the life of the<br />\ntoiler of America, and, therefore,<br />\nthey are rendering an inestimable<br />\nservice to humanity. Trade unions are working for education of<br />\nthe workers, better wages, shorter<br />\nhours,and naturally they hope that<br />\nbetter living conditions will follow<br />\nin the wake of these. The only<br />\nway that trade unions can adequately handle unskilled labor in<br />\nthe future is to prohibit all future<br />\nimmigration of those not fit to<br />\ntake care of themselves.<br />\nThe motto of all labor is: \"United we stand; divided we fall.\"<br />\n<br />\nThe Medical Standard Book Co.<br />\n(THE BOOK<br />\n<br />\nMART)<br />\n<br />\n301 N.

It is far<br />\nIrout our desire to over-emphasize<br />\nthe importance of the work which<br />\nJohns Hopkins has done during<br />\nthe war. We cannot, however, fail<br />\nto remember that the President of<br />\nthe United States, ex officio Commander-in-Chief of our army and<br />\nnavy, is an alumnus of the University, and that the Secretary of<br />\nWar is also an alumnus. No man<br />\nrepresenting our country in diplomatic work during the trying days<br />\nof the war had more. serious responsibilities than the late Walter<br />\nH.

We have<br />\nreference, of course, to Dr. Thayer<br />\nand Dr. Finney. Dr. Welch's modesty will never succeed in concealing the importance of the work<br />\nwhich he did during the war for<br />\nour country. Dr. Young and Dr.<br />\nBaer are among the many Johns<br />\nHopkins men whose services in<br />\nFrance were invaluable.<br />\nAll of us are grateful for the<br />\nwork which these men have done.<br />\nWe want to meet those of our<br />\nalumni who are returning from<br />\nthe war, especially those who are<br />\nwounded and suffering from<br />\nstrains,\u2022 and it is the desire of<br />\nevery Johns Hopkins man or woman to join in the memorial exercises to those who have been left<br />\nbehind in Flanders Field. Possibly some Of us may, however, be<br />\ninclined to feel that a later opportunity may be more suitable to do<br />\nthese things.

Today the<br />\neditor asks me to tell briefly how<br />\nthe system has worked. I am glad<br />\nto be able to say that in my judgment it has worked admirably and<br />\nhas fulfilled the hopes of those<br />\npublic-spirited students who took<br />\nthe initiative in establishing it. It<br />\nis not, of course, one hundred per<br />\ncent. elicient. Not every student<br />\nhas the ... strength of character<br />\nwhich the honor system presupposes, and it is possible that the<br />\nhonor pledge is sometimes misused. But I am'convinced that<br />\nsuch cases are extremely rare; far<br />\nmore rare than the evasions of<br />\nsupervision that take place in colleges where the instructor polices<br />\nthe examination room. Moreover,<br />\nthe honor system produces a spirit<br />\nof mutual confidence between faculty and students and a sense of<br />\nresponsibility in the leaders of<br />\nstudent opinion which are worth<br />\na great deal. The Student Councils of the past few years have<br />\nhad some difficult tasks. It has<br />\nbeen necessary for them to bring<br />\noffenders to trial, to sift evidence,<br />\nand to reach a verdict which involved the dismissal of the culprit<br />\nfrom college. I have been present<br />\nat. some of these trials, and have<br />\nbeen much impressed by the dignity and seriousness of the proceedings and by the justice of the<br />\ndecisions. I can recall no recommendation made by such a student<br />\ncourt to the Dean that was not at<br />\nonce given his official sanction. It<br />\nis a part of the Hopkins system<br />\nthat the actions of the Student<br />\nCouncil in such matters are not<br />\nmade public. They are, however,<br />\nreported to a committee of the<br />\nfaculty, which co-operates closely with the Council. It is fair to<br />\nsay that since the adoption of the<br />\nnot a great<br />\nsystem a number<br />\nnumber, happily\u2014of students have<br />\nbeen tried by their fellows, and<br />\nthat some, having been proved<br />\nguilty, have been advised by the<br />\nCouncil to leave Homewood at<br />\nonce. A student who did not wish<br />\nto accept this verdict was entitled<br />\nto a trial by the Dean and the<br />\nCommittee on Student Affairs;<br />\nbut no defendant has ever challenged the student sentence. I do<br />\nnot wish to imply that the system is largely a matter of compulsion. For the most part, it enforces itself. I do, however, wish<br />\nto assure alumni that student selfgovernment at Hopkins is a reality and that when occasion arises<br />\nit governs.<br /><br />\nGiven Dance by the Beauty of the<br />\nTown\u2014Entertained Royally by<br />\ntheir Hostesses.<br /><br />\nOn last Saturday evening, the<br />\nJohns Hopkins Glee Club, about<br />\nthirty strong, journeyed to Rockville and presented a program of<br />\ngreat harmony and variety. At<br />\nthe dance that followed, and in<br />\nthe various homes where the artists spent the night, our students<br />\nwere entertained in a manner that<br />\nwill cause them each to place a<br />\nbright red dot on that part of the<br />\n\"joy map of Maryland,\" and mark<br />\nthe date of May 31 as one that<br />\nwill never be forgotten.<br />\nThe program opened with the<br />\nUniversity Ode by the Glee Club.<br />\nA piano and violin duet followed,<br />\n--With that<br />\nby McCleary and Cattanach.<br />\nsomething<br />\nBurns' \"John Anderson\" and Foster's \"Old Black Joe\" were then<br />\nthat college<br />\ngiven by the Glee Club.

The speaker<br />\nbriefly \u2022traced the history of trade<br />\nunions from their origin up to<br />\ntheir present status. Exclusive of<br />\nthe old Roman working men<br />\nunions and the English guilds of<br />\nseveral centuries back, Mr. Ferguson stated that the beginning<br />\nof a real trade union came with<br />\nthe organization of the Knights of<br />\nLabor. From this latter body the<br />\npresent American Federation of<br />\nLabor has grown.<br />\nThe American Federation of Labor has at present about three and<br />\none-half million members in the<br />\nUnited States, including skilled<br />\nand unskilled workihgtnen. The<br />\nspeaker also remarked, in reference to the radicalism of trade<br />\nunions, that all great movements<br />\nin the past have been radical ones,<br />\nand that all great men have been<br />\nmore or less radical in their convictions, and surely trade unions<br />\nwould not deny such a compliment.<br />\nTrade unions are a living protest against the present social conditions that destroy the life of the<br />\ntoiler of America, and, therefore,<br />\nthey are rendering an inestimable<br />\nservice to humanity. Trade unions are working for education of<br />\nthe workers, better wages, shorter<br />\nhours,and naturally they hope that<br />\nbetter living conditions will follow<br />\nin the wake of these. The only<br />\nway that trade unions can adequately handle unskilled labor in<br />\nthe future is to prohibit all future<br />\nimmigration of those not fit to<br />\ntake care of themselves.<br />\nThe motto of all labor is: \"United we stand; divided we fall.\"<br /><br />\nThe Medical Standard Book Co.<br />\n(THE BOOK<br /><br />\nMART)<br /><br />\n301 N.
