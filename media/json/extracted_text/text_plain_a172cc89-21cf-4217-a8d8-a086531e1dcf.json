The headline read \"Attractive<br />\nList of Assemblies Planned,\" but with the exception of a circular<br />\ntalk by Mr. J. Stitt Wilson, we could see nothing attractive on the<br />\nentire program.<br />\nAs a matter of fact, apparently only four assemblies have been<br />\nprepared. Two are automatic dates that come every year\u2014the<br />\nfreshman-sophomore debate and the Adams contest; one is Mr.<br />\nWilson's speech, and the fourth is \"pending.\" The latter, if it<br />\nmaterializes, will be an address by a Congressman.<br />\n- This unimposing array could hardly be termed \"attractive.\"<br />\nMr. Wilson, although a most desirable speaker, does not represent<br />\nany great effort on the part of those in charge of the assemblies,<br />\nfor he has been lecturing at many of the Eastern colleges all fall.<br />\nCongressman Reed has not been definitely booked, though his<br />\ntalk will probably be stimulating if he is secured.<br />\nThere are many people of real prominence in the country who<br />\nwould probably be glad to address the student body of Johns<br />\nHopkins University. Dr. Will Durant has lectured at Lafayette,<br />\nM. Andre Maurois at Princeton, and Bertrand Russell at several<br />\nAmerican colleges. There is no reason why men of similar<br />\ncaliber cannot be secured for Hopkins.<br />\nThe huge crowd that packed the C. E. Hall to hear Mr. Arthur<br />\nGarfield Hays last spring is evidence of the fact that upper classmen and faculty members will attend the weekly assemblies if<br />\ninteresting speakers are obtained. The Adams debate contest is<br />\nthrilling indeed, we admit, but think how much more of a thrill<br />\nthe student body would receive from Will Durant or Bertrand<br />\nRussell. How about it, committee?<br />\n<br />\nONE CAN'T KNOW EVERYTHING, THOUGH!<br />\nSome day, if you find life dull and dreary, and you are sorely<br />\nin need of stimulation, try listening in on a lecture in the College<br />\nfor Teachers. Pick one more or less at random, but try to get<br />\none during which the instructor asks questions of the members<br />\nof his class. And then, if fortune smiles upon you, you will be<br />\nblessed with hearing one like this: \"Does anyone in the class<br />\nknow what was the first book published in America?\" Answer<br />\nfrom a young thing in the front row: \"Wasn't it the Bible, professor ?\"<br />\nYea, even in \"college\"!<br />\n<br />\nNOTE ON THE GAME<br />\nThe football team is to be congratulated on the amount of \"pep\"<br />\nshown last Saturday when it played Loyola. And we don't refer<br />\nto pep shown by the team\u2014we mean pep shown by the cheering<br />\nsections. It is generally gratifying to note that the undergraduate<br />\nschool hasn't reached a complete state of atrophy. Keep it up,<br />\nboys!<br />\n<br />\nJOHN EARLE UHLER<br />\n<br />\nAt a time when the Little Theater was growing to be a phenomenon in our stage history, it was natural that devotees of the<br />\ndrama at Hopkins should organize themselves for an attempt to<br />\nestablish a Little Theater here. Early in 1921, several members<br />\nof the faculty, a few alumni and a handful of students elected officers, adopted a constitution and started at work as a simple production of one-act plays.<br />\nThese early productions, staged in the top floor of the Barn<br />\nfor a small but very sympathetic and interested audience, consisted mostly of original plays\u2014that is, plays written by members<br />\nof the organization; and these plays, as I recall, were for the most<br />\npart adaptations of short stories.<br />\nThe original interest grew apace until the management in a few<br />\nmonths felt justified in presenting a bill before the public. The<br />\nVagabond Theater, then in the Saint James Apartments, was<br />\nrented for the premiere, and a bill of three one-act plays, one of<br />\nwhich was original, was offered with entirely satisfactory results.<br />\nThe chief significance of this effort lay in the one original play,<br />\ncalled Hamlet. There was about as much similarity between it and<br />\nHamlet as between a weed and an aged oak, but it was original,<br />\nand it showed some promise of better work on the part of the<br />\nplaywright.<br />\nIt was and is in this respect that the Playshop should find its<br />\ngreatest success, namely, in encouraging the local playwright.<br />\nThere is a place for the classics in the activities of the organization, but without some promotion of the writing of plays on the<br />\npart of the members, the Little Theater is in danger of degenerating into a poor imitation of the professional theater.<br />\nIn the summer of 1921 the first production was staged for the<br />\nstudents of the Summer School, a precedent which has been followed each year to the present time, and which, I hope, will be<br />\ncontinued. Such plays as Garrick's Lying Valet, Rostrand's The<br />\nRomancers and Mitchell's New York Idea have been put on before<br />\nthe Summer School students.<br />\nThese various activities were successful enough to encourage<br />\nthe members of the Playshop to agitate the question of securing<br />\na theater of their own. After consultation with President Goodnow, Dr. French and Dr. Goodnow and others examining the<br />\nattics of the various buildings, it was finally decided that the best<br />\navailable place was the old so-called gymnasium, which was then<br />\nfilled to the rafters with rocks belonging to the Geology Department and with cannon and other equipment belonging to the<br />\nMilitary Department. Rocks and cannon were soon removed and<br />\nthe careful plans made by the Playshop committee soon transformed the building into a very attractive Little Theater.<br />\nHere, however, lies a tale. To work the necessary changes in<br />\nthe old building, a fund of about $2000 was required. In order<br />\nto secure this sum, the Playshop management appealed through<br />\nPresident Goodnow to the Board of Trustees for a loan, with the<br />\nprovision that the loan would be repaid. The final balance was<br />\nreturned to the Trustees just a month ago, so that now members<br />\nof the Playshop can indulge in a feeling of triumph, not only because they have performed creditably from an artistic point of view,<br />\nbut because they have done what many artists fail to do; they<br />\nhave succeeded financially. Incidentally, I may add that practically half the debt was paid solely during the past year, which<br />\nhas been in many ways the most successful season of all.<br />\nThe first performance in the new building consisted of three<br />\none-act original plays, one a poetic drama, one a comedy and the<br />\nlast a tragedy. In order to get the stage ready, the art staff and<br />\nsome of the actors worked throughout the previous night until<br />\nfive o'clock in the morning. This spirit was prevalent throughout the,organization and made possible such a successful performance that President Goodnow, who was in the audience, mentioned<br />\nin a speech before the alumni that the Hopkins Playshop, together<br />\nwith the orchestra and the Tudor and Stuart Club, offered many<br />\npossibilities for the cultural development of the students at this<br />\nUniversity.<br />\nA change in policy took place in the season of 1925. Up to that<br />\ntime we had emphasized the so-called original play. In the season<br />\nof 1925-1926, however, although we did not neglect the original<br />\nplay entirely, we planned a program unique in the history of the<br />\ntheater in that each play of the program was connected in some<br />\nway with the play preceding. The season of 1925-1926 was a<br />\nseason of period dramafl One play was chosen from each of<br />\nfour periods\u2014Farquhar's Beaus Stratagem from the Restoration<br />\nperiod; Hugo's Ruy Bias from the French Rennaisance ; Payne's<br />\nCaptain Copp from the early American, and Fitch's Truth from<br />\nthe modern period. In the season of 1926-1927 the season was<br />\none of national drama.

The headline read \"Attractive<br />\nList of Assemblies Planned,\" but with the exception of a circular<br />\ntalk by Mr. J. Stitt Wilson, we could see nothing attractive on the<br />\nentire program.<br />\nAs a matter of fact, apparently only four assemblies have been<br />\nprepared. Two are automatic dates that come every year\u2014the<br />\nfreshman-sophomore debate and the Adams contest; one is Mr.<br />\nWilson's speech, and the fourth is \"pending.\" The latter, if it<br />\nmaterializes, will be an address by a Congressman.<br />\n- This unimposing array could hardly be termed \"attractive.\"<br />\nMr. Wilson, although a most desirable speaker, does not represent<br />\nany great effort on the part of those in charge of the assemblies,<br />\nfor he has been lecturing at many of the Eastern colleges all fall.<br />\nCongressman Reed has not been definitely booked, though his<br />\ntalk will probably be stimulating if he is secured.<br />\nThere are many people of real prominence in the country who<br />\nwould probably be glad to address the student body of Johns<br />\nHopkins University. Dr. Will Durant has lectured at Lafayette,<br />\nM. Andre Maurois at Princeton, and Bertrand Russell at several<br />\nAmerican colleges. There is no reason why men of similar<br />\ncaliber cannot be secured for Hopkins.<br />\nThe huge crowd that packed the C. E. Hall to hear Mr. Arthur<br />\nGarfield Hays last spring is evidence of the fact that upper classmen and faculty members will attend the weekly assemblies if<br />\ninteresting speakers are obtained. The Adams debate contest is<br />\nthrilling indeed, we admit, but think how much more of a thrill<br />\nthe student body would receive from Will Durant or Bertrand<br />\nRussell. How about it, committee?<br /><br />\nONE CAN'T KNOW EVERYTHING, THOUGH!<br />\nSome day, if you find life dull and dreary, and you are sorely<br />\nin need of stimulation, try listening in on a lecture in the College<br />\nfor Teachers. Pick one more or less at random, but try to get<br />\none during which the instructor asks questions of the members<br />\nof his class. And then, if fortune smiles upon you, you will be<br />\nblessed with hearing one like this: \"Does anyone in the class<br />\nknow what was the first book published in America?\" Answer<br />\nfrom a young thing in the front row: \"Wasn't it the Bible, professor ?\"<br />\nYea, even in \"college\"!<br /><br />\nNOTE ON THE GAME<br />\nThe football team is to be congratulated on the amount of \"pep\"<br />\nshown last Saturday when it played Loyola. And we don't refer<br />\nto pep shown by the team\u2014we mean pep shown by the cheering<br />\nsections. It is generally gratifying to note that the undergraduate<br />\nschool hasn't reached a complete state of atrophy. Keep it up,<br />\nboys!<br /><br />\nJOHN EARLE UHLER<br /><br />\nAt a time when the Little Theater was growing to be a phenomenon in our stage history, it was natural that devotees of the<br />\ndrama at Hopkins should organize themselves for an attempt to<br />\nestablish a Little Theater here. Early in 1921, several members<br />\nof the faculty, a few alumni and a handful of students elected officers, adopted a constitution and started at work as a simple production of one-act plays.<br />\nThese early productions, staged in the top floor of the Barn<br />\nfor a small but very sympathetic and interested audience, consisted mostly of original plays\u2014that is, plays written by members<br />\nof the organization; and these plays, as I recall, were for the most<br />\npart adaptations of short stories.<br />\nThe original interest grew apace until the management in a few<br />\nmonths felt justified in presenting a bill before the public. The<br />\nVagabond Theater, then in the Saint James Apartments, was<br />\nrented for the premiere, and a bill of three one-act plays, one of<br />\nwhich was original, was offered with entirely satisfactory results.<br />\nThe chief significance of this effort lay in the one original play,<br />\ncalled Hamlet. There was about as much similarity between it and<br />\nHamlet as between a weed and an aged oak, but it was original,<br />\nand it showed some promise of better work on the part of the<br />\nplaywright.<br />\nIt was and is in this respect that the Playshop should find its<br />\ngreatest success, namely, in encouraging the local playwright.<br />\nThere is a place for the classics in the activities of the organization, but without some promotion of the writing of plays on the<br />\npart of the members, the Little Theater is in danger of degenerating into a poor imitation of the professional theater.<br />\nIn the summer of 1921 the first production was staged for the<br />\nstudents of the Summer School, a precedent which has been followed each year to the present time, and which, I hope, will be<br />\ncontinued. Such plays as Garrick's Lying Valet, Rostrand's The<br />\nRomancers and Mitchell's New York Idea have been put on before<br />\nthe Summer School students.<br />\nThese various activities were successful enough to encourage<br />\nthe members of the Playshop to agitate the question of securing<br />\na theater of their own. After consultation with President Goodnow, Dr. French and Dr. Goodnow and others examining the<br />\nattics of the various buildings, it was finally decided that the best<br />\navailable place was the old so-called gymnasium, which was then<br />\nfilled to the rafters with rocks belonging to the Geology Department and with cannon and other equipment belonging to the<br />\nMilitary Department. Rocks and cannon were soon removed and<br />\nthe careful plans made by the Playshop committee soon transformed the building into a very attractive Little Theater.<br />\nHere, however, lies a tale. To work the necessary changes in<br />\nthe old building, a fund of about $2000 was required. In order<br />\nto secure this sum, the Playshop management appealed through<br />\nPresident Goodnow to the Board of Trustees for a loan, with the<br />\nprovision that the loan would be repaid. The final balance was<br />\nreturned to the Trustees just a month ago, so that now members<br />\nof the Playshop can indulge in a feeling of triumph, not only because they have performed creditably from an artistic point of view,<br />\nbut because they have done what many artists fail to do; they<br />\nhave succeeded financially. Incidentally, I may add that practically half the debt was paid solely during the past year, which<br />\nhas been in many ways the most successful season of all.<br />\nThe first performance in the new building consisted of three<br />\none-act original plays, one a poetic drama, one a comedy and the<br />\nlast a tragedy. In order to get the stage ready, the art staff and<br />\nsome of the actors worked throughout the previous night until<br />\nfive o'clock in the morning. This spirit was prevalent throughout the,organization and made possible such a successful performance that President Goodnow, who was in the audience, mentioned<br />\nin a speech before the alumni that the Hopkins Playshop, together<br />\nwith the orchestra and the Tudor and Stuart Club, offered many<br />\npossibilities for the cultural development of the students at this<br />\nUniversity.<br />\nA change in policy took place in the season of 1925. Up to that<br />\ntime we had emphasized the so-called original play. In the season<br />\nof 1925-1926, however, although we did not neglect the original<br />\nplay entirely, we planned a program unique in the history of the<br />\ntheater in that each play of the program was connected in some<br />\nway with the play preceding. The season of 1925-1926 was a<br />\nseason of period dramafl One play was chosen from each of<br />\nfour periods\u2014Farquhar's Beaus Stratagem from the Restoration<br />\nperiod; Hugo's Ruy Bias from the French Rennaisance ; Payne's<br />\nCaptain Copp from the early American, and Fitch's Truth from<br />\nthe modern period. In the season of 1926-1927 the season was<br />\none of national drama. Five plays were presented\u2014The Hraun<br />\nFarm from Icelandic literature; The Main Thing from the Russian; The Round Trip from the English; The Great Galerto from<br />\nthe Spanish, and A Tear in the Devil's Eye from the Japanese.<br />\nI may add, too, that The Round Trip is the play from the pen of<br />\nJohn van Druten, author of Young Woodley, in which Glenn<br />\nHunter starred. Mr. van Druten came to Baltimore for one production of the Round Trip, directed the play and took the leading<br />\npart.<br /><br />\nAdvance Showing of<br />\n\u2022<br /><br />\ntet5on CIAO<br /><br />\nfor FALL<br /><br />\n$29.50 &amp;$34.50<br />\nFor the new season we have assembled the finest<br />\nvariety of men's<br />\nsuits it has ever<br />\nbeen our privilege<br />\nto present.
