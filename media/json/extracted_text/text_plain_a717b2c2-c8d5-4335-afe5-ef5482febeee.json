Baltimore's one art house<br />\nis now coming out of its summer<br />\ndoldrums. \"Tunnelvision\" played<br />\nthere all summer, which is akin<br />\nto spending your summer reading<br />\nMad magazine. It was followed<br />\nby a West German political<br />\nthriller, \"The Lost Honor of<br />\nKatharina Blum,\" a film<br />\nconstructed with all the cliches<br />\nof political filmmaking. Chabrol's<br />\nnew film is an exciting end to<br />\nthese months of mediocrity.<br />\nThe film opens with a man, a<br />\nwoman, and a small child playing<br />\nby the sea; they are, to all<br />\nappearances, happy; but in<br />\nChabrol's world, as in<br />\nHitchcock's, appearances are<br />\ndeceptive. The next scene<br />\nestablishes the passage of several<br />\nyears; the infant girl is now six<br />\nyears old; the family is shown<br />\nenjoying a leisurely country<br />\nexistence. When the couple sits<br />\ndown to dinner in front of the<br />\nTV, the man asks her if she is<br />\nbored. He tells her that \"It's<br />\nimproper to cut salad.\" She<br />\nresponds, \"I don't care.\" This<br />\npiece of conversation, like<br />\neverything else in the film, is<br />\nsignificant; this leaves the movie<br />\nopen to the valid criticism that it<br />\nis overstated.<br />\nThe man is socially and<br />\nintellectually superior to the<br />\nwoman and he never lets her'<br />\nforget this. Paul and Danielle.<br />\nGegauff are married in the real<br />\nworld, have written the script,and portray the couple in<br />\nChabrol's reel world. To most<br />\nAmerican audiences they seem to,<br />\nbe a married couple because they<br />\nlive as any married couple might,<br />\nand it is a surprise to discover<br />\nthat their eight years and one<br />\nchild have been without a<br />\nwedding license. These actors<br />\nbring conviction to every line;<br />\nwhen Esther says,\"I don't care,\"<br />\nwe are intensely aware of the<br />\nfury which she can barely<br />\nconceal. She has been a loyal<br />\nbedmate and homemaker. He, on<br />\nthe other hand, has been a firm.<br />\nbeliever in the double standard.<br />\nIn bed with Esther, Philip brags<br />\nthat he has been unfaithful six<br />\ntimes; when he asks if she has<br />\nhad any affairs, she replies,\"You<br />\nknow I haven't.\"<br />\nPhilip tells Esther that he.<br />\nwouldn't mind if she had an<br />\naffair. He doesn't really expect<br />\nher to accept the offer; he seems<br />\nconfident that she will remain his<br />\nconcubine.<br />\n\"Never,\" she replies to his.<br />\noffer.<br />\n\"You should,\" he insists.<br />\n\"What?\"<br />\n\"Sleep with another guy. To<br />\nsome, sleeping around means<br />\ncheating. Let's prove it's not.\"<br />\nThough they still live in the<br />\ncountry they make attempts at a<br />\nmore cosmopolitan existence;<br />\nEst her meets a man named<br />\nHabib. just returned from Tokyo,<br />\na man who's always \"with it.\" At<br />\na dinner party Philip tells his wife<br />\n<br />\nto \"keep your apron on;\" there is<br />\nan obvious discrepancy between<br />\nthe fashionable attitudes they<br />\nprofess and the lives they<br />\ncontinue to lead.<br />\nAfter the party has ended,<br />\nPhilip wakes up in bed, doesn't<br />\n<br />\nfind his woman by his side, and<br />\ngoes downstairs, where he<br />\noverhears Esther and Habib.<br />\nFollowing them upstairs he looks<br />\nfirst in his room, expecting<br />\nthem to commit the act in his<br />\nvery bed. Not finding them, he<br />\nascends to the third floor and<br />\nenters his daughter's room.<br />\n(Esther has become corrupted,<br />\nbut his daughter Elise is still a<br />\nfaithful and innocent female. It<br />\nis, of course, significant that<br />\nPhilip calls both Esther and Elise<br />\n\"my little llama.\") Touching<br />\nElise on the nose, he calls her<br />\n'my darling angel.\" He can hear<br />\nEsther's orgasmic \"Again, again,\"<br />\nand Habib's \"Such soft skin.\"<br />\nThe next morning Philip takes<br />\na rose to Esther, brings her<br />\nbreakfast in bed, and tells her<br />\nthat \"You got a llama's nose.\"<br />\nThese are traditional ways in<br />\nwhich a man tries to keep a<br />\nwoman in bondage. Only a few<br />\ndays before he had suggested<br />\nbreaking these very bonds. Esther<br />\nsays that she is glad to be a llama<br />\n\"if it makes you happy.\" Like<br />\nBertolucci in \"Last Tango in<br />\nParis,\" Chabrol raises questions<br />\nabout the politics of sexual<br />\nfreedom: Can people handle<br />\ncomplete sexual freedom? Do<br />\nthey even want to be free?<br />\nMarriage is a legal bond; the<br />\nfact that they are not married<br />\nremoves this bond, but they live<br />\nas a married couple does, and<br />\nconsequently their<br />\nresponsibilities toward one<br />\nanother are the same as those of<br />\na married couple. Their situation<br />\nis ambiguous in that they have<br />\nthe moral responsibilities of.<br />\n<br />\nmarriage but are not legally<br />\nobligated to fulfill these<br />\nresponsibilities. They are<br />\nexperimenting with slavery and<br />\nfreedom; they never realize either<br />\none, but continue to vacillate<br />\nfrom one to the other.<br />\n<br />\nWhile shopping, he criticizes<br />\nher pronunciation of<br />\n\"chocolate,\" to which she<br />\nresponds, \"Next time I'll shop<br />\nalone,\" and then she deliberately<br />\nsays \"schocolate.\"<br />\nPhilip has ordered that sex not<br />\nbe restricted to one partner, arid<br />\nshe,so long restrained by her role<br />\nof wife, responds as Philip has<br />\ntold her. As they lie in bed and<br />\ndiscuss their affairs, their voices<br />\nare restrained, their faces nearly<br />\nexpressionless. He asks,<br />\nseemingly out of intellectual<br />\ncuriosity, if she has ever slept<br />\nwith Habib.<br />\n\"Yes.\"<br />\n\"So... He's a good lay.\"<br />\n\"Great.\"<br />\n\"In love with him?\"<br />\n\"You crazy? I like him, that's<br />\nall.\"<br />\n\"We promised to tell all.\"<br />\n\"Sure.\"<br />\n\"Other guys and girls are<br />\npreventive medicine.\"<br />\nThey want to believe, or at<br />\nleast profess to believe, that<br />\nsleeping around will bring them<br />\ncloser together. But when they<br />\nattempt to treat sex casually,<br />\nthey find that they are incapable<br />\nof maintaining serious<br />\nrelationships.<br />\nIn the ensuing confusion, there<br />\nis always the danger that the<br />\nparticipants in these sexual<br />\nexperiments will slip back into<br />\nthe well-known, and perhaps<br />\nmore secure traditional roles. As<br />\nthey drive down a road he tells<br />\nher that \"The future means<br />\ndeath.\" Chabrol makes this drive<br />\ntoward complete freedom a<br />\ndeadly one. Philip continues to<br />\n<br />\nboast that \"I taught her good<br />\ntaste;\" he has a way of keeping<br />\nher in line sexually: \"I'll fuck her<br />\nup all evening;\" and in front of<br />\ntheir friends he continually<br />\norders her to \"Pour me another<br />\ndrink.\" His fashionable liberalism<br />\n<br />\ncaused him to insist upon total<br />\nsexual freedom, but lie never<br />\ndoes believe in this. Having<br />\nforced freedom upon Esther, he<br />\nimmediately regrets having done<br />\nso. When he talks to Esther now,<br />\nhe tries to convince her that<br />\nfreedom is undesirable.<br />\n\"Freedom is the anxiety of<br />\nsolitude,\" he says. \"Slavery<br />\nmeans security.\"<br />\nBut Esther, despite her own<br />\ndoubts as to what she sould do<br />\nwith this newly -discovered<br />\nfreedom, is convinced that she<br />\nwill never return to slavery; she<br />\nrefuses to be his llama.<br />\nSleeping around becomes a<br />\nweapon. Esther tells Philip that if<br />\n<br />\nhe sleeps with Annie she will<br />\nsleep with Habib. Philip's<br />\ngrowing impotency in controlling<br />\nEsther is soon supplemented bY<br />\nphysical impotence. He tells<br />\nAnnie, \"I'm really ashamed.\" His<br />\nbody and his words have become<br />\nimpotent.<br />\n\"I love you,\" he tells Annie.<br />\n\"Liar,\" she responds.<br />\n\"I want to love you.\"<br />\n\"That's not the same.\"<br />\n\"I wonder.\"<br />\nThe film makes a jump here'<br />\nThis is a jump in the direction of<br />\nthe plot, because Chabrol's<br />\nthematic progression is steady.<br />\nEsther delcares that \"We need<br />\na change.\" Neither is satisfied<br />\nwith their current situation.<br />\nPhilip's main reservation is that if<br />\nthey were to move from their<br />\nrural manse to Paris, he would<br />\nlose what little control he still<br />\nhad over Esther. This is why he<br />\nobjects . . . \"But I feel as if I was<br />\nborn here.\" Traditional roles are<br />\nassociated with traditional sytles<br />\nof life and places of habitation.<br />\nHis fears are well-founded. In the<br />\ncountry, she had no one but the<br />\n\"with it\" Habib, but now she will<br />\nhave all of Paris to tempt her. It<br />\ndoesn't take long until they are<br />\nin Paris and she says, \"I want to<br />\nwork . . . Habib has a job for nie,<br />\nin his music publishing house.<br />\nOne night she deliberatelY<br />\nbreaks a promise to return home.<br />\nPhilip consoles Elise: \"We'll have<br />\nfun anyway,\" and proposes that<br />\nthey watch TV;this is a variation<br />\non the earlier TV scene with his<br />\nother \"llama.\" When Esther<br />\nreturns home,. Philip is sleeping<br />\nwith Elise, and while the<br />\nimplication doesn't seem to be<br />\nsexual, it is certainly possessive.<br />\nPhilip forces Esther to discuss<br />\nthe issue: \"I want to talk. We<br />\nmade an agreement. The idea of<br />\nparallel lives was to bring us<br />\ncloser together.\" Parallel lives<br />\nbecame separate lives. He regrets<br />\nthat \"I wasn't smart enough t\u00b0<br />\neducate you.\" Although she<br />\nretorts that \"people - do change'<br />\nI've changed,\" she continues t\u00b0<br />\nperform her duties, though he<br />\nmust constantly superintend<br />\nthese duties, and hatred is alwaYs<br />\nvisible in her face.

The incumbent<br />\nwill not capture Baltimore in the upcoming election. Instead<br />\nhe will concentrate on the Maryland suburbs and rural areas,<br />\nwhere \"walk around\" money is ineffective. Sarbanes, who<br />\nneeds a convincing plurality on his home turf to win, will<br />\ncontinue the tradition.<br />\nThe media has taken the Republican's bait and made it<br />\nseem as if Beall's act is some splendid moral initiative and not<br />\nthe politically expedient move which it is. Beall has smartly<br />\nelected to save badly needed campaign funds rather than<br />\nuselessly does out on a seemingly lost cause.<br />\nWhile \"walk around\" -money is a topic for debate, it is not<br />\nthe overwhelmingly obvious evil which Beall and persuaded<br />\nmedia accomplices would have the public believe.

Eisenhowei<br />\nSymposium, 1976: The Question<br />\nof Freedom, we feel that several<br />\npoints could prove misleading to<br />\nthe student body. We would like<br />\nto correct these, if possible.<br />\n1) \"(The co-chairmen) have<br />\nchosen a number of relatively<br />\nunknown speakers, hoping that<br />\nthis would be beneficial for<br />\nattracting a larger, less-qiased<br />\naudience.\" To begin with, we<br />\nhave arranged for such eminent<br />\nspeakers as Noam Chomsky,<br />\nwhose work in Linguistics has<br />\nrevolutionized that field, with far<br />\nreaching consequences in<br />\nphilosophy, psychology, and<br />\npolitical science; Michael<br />\nHarrington, author of The Other<br />\nAmerica, whose latest book, The<br />\nTwilight of Capitalism has<br />\nreceived enthusiastic reviews<br />\nfrom all sides, and Rollo May,<br />\nwho developed the concept of<br />\nExistential Psychology. All in all,<br />\nwe are bringing to campus sonic<br />\nof the most consistently<br />\nexcellent speakers in recent<br />\nmemory. few of whom could be<br />\nconsidered \"lesser known\".<br />\nMoreover, we have no desire to<br />\ncontrol the temperment of the<br />\naudience. as our speakers are<br />\nperfectly capable of fending for<br />\nthemselves.<br />\n<br />\n2) We have chosen to utilize a<br />\nlecture format not because it is<br />\ntraditional, but because we feel it<br />\nprovides the best means for the<br />\nspeaker to express his views<br />\nsuccinctly. In addition, we are<br />\nhoping to arrange a panel<br />\ndiscussion on the subject of<br />\nacademic freedom. To the best of<br />\nour knowledge, this will be the<br />\nfirst panel ever conducted during<br />\nan Eisenhower Symposium.<br />\n3) Just as a note of<br />\ninformation, Yvonne Burke, U.S.<br />\nRepresentative trom California,.<br />\nwill be speaking at 7:00 p.m.<br />\nTuesday in Shriver Hall. Mrs.<br />\nBurke is intelligent, articulate,<br />\nand one of the finest speakers we<br />\nhave been fortunate enough to<br />\nwitness. To those who are<br />\npresent we can guarantee an<br />\nexcellent and informative lecture.<br />\nFinally, I would like to say<br />\nthat the Eisenhower Symposium<br />\nis today considered one of the<br />\nmost important symposia of its<br />\nkind in the nation.

The Unitarian Church is<br />\na direct outgrowth of the<br />\nChristian Church, and has been in<br />\nexistence far longer than Moon's<br />\nmovement.

She is seemingly alarmed<br />\nat the continuing lack of<br />\ngovernmental responsiveness to<br />\nmeaningful tax reform, to<br />\nimposing greater controls upon<br />\nthe multinationals (particularly<br />\ninsofar as curbing their ability to<br />\nevade U.S. taxes and drain jobs<br />\naway from Americans), and all<br />\nthe other issues one would<br />\nexpect a good liberal to be<br />\npreoccupied with.<br />\nIndeed, she is such a good<br />\nliberal that she wholeheartedly<br />\nsupports and endorses California<br />\nSenator John V.

Unfortunately, her<br />\nsupport for the lackluster<br />\nSenator (whose only claims to<br />\nfame are his reputation as a lazy,<br />\ndo-nothing Senator, his ties to<br />\n\"best friend\" Ted Kennedy, a<br />\nvery late and<br />\nPolitically-motivated concern<br />\nover U.S. involvement in Angola,<br />\nand a smile that Jimmy Carter<br />\nmust have studied for years)<br />\nbegan months ago, at a time<br />\nwhen a real chance still existed<br />\nfor Californians to send Tom<br />\n<br />\nHayden to the stuffy Senate<br />\nchambers.<br />\nAdmitting that a Tom Hayden<br />\nin the Senate would have voted<br />\nthe \"right\" way at least as often<br />\nas Iunney, she defended the<br />\nSenator on the basis of his talent<br />\nfor not rocking the Senate boat.<br />\nThis, supposedly, enables Tunney<br />\nto work on projects which novice<br />\nHayden, being more abrasive and<br />\nless compromising, would have<br />\nbeen unable to realize.<br />\nCuriously, this contrasts with<br />\nBurke's earlier insistence that the<br />\ngovernment's duty was to lead,to<br />\nbe out in front, to act forcefully<br />\nin the interests of the American<br />\npeople\u2014all the things John<br />\nTunney has yet to show he has<br />\nthe slightest inclination of doing.<br />\nGood liberal to the end, though,<br />\nshe would be glad to support Mr.<br />\nHayden for Congressman.

Aside from a<br />\ngenuine attempt to solve the<br />\nfarm labor conflict long plaguing<br />\nCalifornia and making some good<br />\nappointments, Brown has<br />\nresorted to a Carteresque \"trust<br />\nme\".

The<br />\nactual tutoring starts the<br />\nfollowing week as kids from the<br />\nCity are transported to the<br />\nHomewood carnpus to meet their<br />\ntutors.<br />\nThe effectiveness of the Johns<br />\nHopkins Tutorial Project has<br />\nbeen lauded by various state and<br />\nnational agencies, including the<br />\nNational Reading Center and the<br />\nState Department of Education.<br />\nChaplain Dr. Chester L. Wickwire<br />\nsees the Project as \"a symbol of<br />\nWhat the Hopkins campus has<br />\nclone for the city.\" Funding for<br />\nthe Project comes mainly from<br />\nthe Baltimore Urban Services<br />\nAgency, individuals and groups<br />\nwithin the community and the<br />\nUniversity itself. But as with<br />\nMost \"good causes\", expenses<br />\nOften surpass the funds available<br />\nand there is a constant search to<br />\nfind the money necessary to<br />\nContinue.<br />\n\"The Tutorial Project actually<br />\nc onsist? of three separate<br />\nPrograms<br />\n0<br />\na out fi ft<br />\n<br />\nchildren each from various parts<br />\nof Baltimore,\" explained David<br />\nFishkin, the Chaplain's Office<br />\ncoordinator of the Project. Each<br />\nweek the children receive three<br />\nhours of strictly one-to-one<br />\ntutoring with additional cultural<br />\nor recreational activities also<br />\nplanned. The primary purpose of<br />\nthe tutoring is to improve the<br />\nchildren's basic skills in math and<br />\nreading. Fishkin also cited an<br />\nimproved attitude toward<br />\nacademic learning, the<br />\nopportunity to relate closely<br />\nwith a non-family adult, and<br />\nhigher self-esteem as other<br />\nbenefits a child receives form the<br />\ninstruction.<br />\nPerhaps the main problem that<br />\nhas plagued the Tutorial Project<br />\nin past years has been the<br />\noccasional lack of good teaching<br />\nexperiences. Sometimes the<br />\ntutor-child relationship would<br />\nwork in the social and<br />\nrecreational spheres, but fall<br />\nshort in the area of actual<br />\nlearning. Fishkin admitted that<br />\nthere have been deficiencies in<br />\nteaching in the past and blames<br />\nthem on a lack of structure in the<br />\neducational relationship. \"Most<br />\nstudents have the potential to be<br />\ngood tutors,\" asserted Fishkin,<br />\n\"but they need more guidance<br />\nthan they have received in the<br />\npast.

They are<br />\ndefensive halfback Brian Coulter,<br />\ndefensive safety and tight end<br />\nMike Rhodey and tailback Brett<br />\nMiles. Each of these players has a<br />\nvast amount of football<br />\nexperience and can use this when<br />\ndealing with their teammates.<br />\n<br />\nbe the leader of the<br />\nteam\u2014something best<br />\naccomplished by his own<br />\nexample.<br />\nThe second half of the role of<br />\nthe captain, according to Brian, is<br />\nto be a liason man between the<br />\ncoaches and the players. It's<br />\nnecessary for someone to be able<br />\nto transmit problems,<br />\nsuggestions, etc. within the team<br />\nframework and this job falls to<br />\nthe captain.<br />\nCoulter is optimistic about the<br />\ncoming season. He feels that the<br />\nteam is playing with a great deal<br />\nof emotion and that a winning<br />\nseason should be easily<br />\naccomplished.<br />\nRhodey<br />\n<br />\nCoulter<br />\nCoulter is an environmental<br />\nengineering major from<br />\nWillmington, Delaware and<br />\nwould like to attend law school<br />\nUpon graduation. He's been<br />\ncompeting in organized football<br />\nsince the fourth grade and has<br />\nalways basically been a defensive<br />\nhalfback.<br />\nHe feels that the job of the<br />\ncaptain is twofold. One part is to<br />\n<br />\nMike Rhodey has also been an<br />\nactive football player since the<br />\nfourth grade. However, the<br />\nversatile social and behavioral<br />\nscience major from Timonium<br />\nhas played a variety of positions.<br />\nHe was a quarterback in high<br />\nschool and came to JHU<br />\nexpecting to continue at that<br />\nposition. But he soon became a<br />\nhalfback and finally ended up at<br />\nsafety this year while also playing<br />\n<br />\nsome tight end.<br />\nMike feels that, as a captain,<br />\nhis primary job is leadership<br />\nthrough example. If the present<br />\npositive attitude can be<br />\nmaintained, he contends, there's<br />\nno reason why this can't be one<br />\nof the best years in recent Blue<br />\nJay football.<br />\nHe is also encouraged by the<br />\ntype of athlete who is out for the<br />\nteam this year. Unlike the past<br />\nfew years, the members of the<br />\n<br />\n1976 squad want to just go out<br />\nonto the field, have fun and win.<br />\nMiles<br />\nBrett Miles can be described as<br />\nsomewhat of an international<br />\nathlete. He played high school as<br />\na quarterback in Heidelberg,<br />\nGermany, where he was a three<br />\nyear varsity starter.<br />\nHowever, when he arrived at<br />\nHopkins, the social and<br />\nbehavioral science major did not<br />\n<br />\nplay football in his freshman and<br />\nsophomore years. His first season<br />\nof intercollegiate action was last<br />\nyear, when he played quite<br />\neffectively as a tailback.<br />\nMiles believes that there is a<br />\ngreat deal of responsibility<br />\nattached to the job of team<br />\ncaptain. The captain must be a<br />\nleader in every respect, helping to<br />\nbuild morale and making<br />\niecisions affecting the team.<br />\nHe is impressed by the positive<br />\nattitude on this year's squad and<br />\nthe emphasis on teamwork. The<br />\nfreshmen especially have been<br />\nmade to feel at home and as a<br />\npart of the team.<br />\nBrett is very optimistic about<br />\nthe upcoming season.<br />\n\"We should definitely have a<br />\nwinning season,\" he claims. \"It's<br />\njust a question of how many wins<br />\nwe'll have.\"<br />\nThe captains will lead the Jays<br />\nagainst Franklin and Marshall<br />\ntomorrow afternoon as they<br />\nopen their home schedule.

Although JHU goalie Coco<br />\nLackey had made several<br />\nexcellent saves, the inability of<br />\nthe defense to clear th'e ball<br />\ndownfield paved the way for the<br />\nscore.<br />\nThe Blue Jays came back<br />\nstrong and began to apply<br />\npressure deep in Loyola territory.<br />\nThe Hopkins offense gained<br />\ncontrol of the action and<br />\nunleashed a series of shots on the<br />\nOpposing goal.<br />\nThe Loyola goalie, realizing<br />\nthe impossibility of trying to<br />\nclear the ball without a Hopkins<br />\ninterception and goal, trapped<br />\nthe ball between her feet to stop<br />\n<br />\nplay. Such an intentional<br />\nstoppage of play is illegal,<br />\nhowever, and therefore a foul was<br />\ncalled on Loyola, thus awarding a<br />\npenalty shot to Hopkins.<br />\nLady Jay Coach Micul Ann<br />\nMorse selected co-captain Marty<br />\nKing to try and take advantage of<br />\nthis opportunity. However,<br />\nMarty was unable to find the<br />\nrange and the score remained 1-0<br />\nat the end of the first half.<br />\nComing out ready to win in<br />\nthe second half, the Blue Jays<br />\ncontinued to dominate play.<br />\nOnly on rare occasions did the<br />\nball cross the center line into<br />\nHopkins territory.<br />\nWith fifteen minutes having<br />\nbeen played in the second half,<br />\nJHU forward Ellen Lim spotted<br />\nthe open left corner of the net,<br />\nshot and scored. The goal was<br />\nnot only Hopkins' first of the<br />\ngame, but the first of the season<br />\nfor the Lady Jays as well. With<br />\nthe score now tied and the<br />\nmomentum seemingly in the Blue<br />\nJays favor, the Hopkins loyal<br />\nbegan readying themselves for<br />\nthe team's first victory.<br />\n<br />\nLoyola, however, was not<br />\nready to quit. With just four<br />\nminutes remaining in the game,<br />\nWain tallied her second goal of<br />\nthe game, putting Loyola ahead<br />\n2-1. Hopkins couldn't mount any<br />\noffense in the remaining time and<br />\nwent down to defeat.<br />\nWain, a centerforward playing<br />\nin only her second intercollegiate<br />\ngame, is considered Loyola's<br />\nmost promising player. As one of<br />\nher teammates said, she \"just<br />\nappears out of nowhere and is<br />\nalways in the right spot.\" Gena<br />\nnow has three goals in those two<br />\ngames.<br />\nAlthough they suffered a<br />\ndefeat, it was an excellent outing<br />\nfor the Blue Jays. The team has<br />\nthe talent to win and will be a<br />\ntough competitor throughout the<br />\nentire season.<br />\nRevenge against Loyola is still<br />\npossible this season.

Baltimore's one art house<br />\nis now coming out of its summer<br />\ndoldrums. \"Tunnelvision\" played<br />\nthere all summer, which is akin<br />\nto spending your summer reading<br />\nMad magazine. It was followed<br />\nby a West German political<br />\nthriller, \"The Lost Honor of<br />\nKatharina Blum,\" a film<br />\nconstructed with all the cliches<br />\nof political filmmaking. Chabrol's<br />\nnew film is an exciting end to<br />\nthese months of mediocrity.<br />\nThe film opens with a man, a<br />\nwoman, and a small child playing<br />\nby the sea; they are, to all<br />\nappearances, happy; but in<br />\nChabrol's world, as in<br />\nHitchcock's, appearances are<br />\ndeceptive. The next scene<br />\nestablishes the passage of several<br />\nyears; the infant girl is now six<br />\nyears old; the family is shown<br />\nenjoying a leisurely country<br />\nexistence. When the couple sits<br />\ndown to dinner in front of the<br />\nTV, the man asks her if she is<br />\nbored. He tells her that \"It's<br />\nimproper to cut salad.\" She<br />\nresponds, \"I don't care.\" This<br />\npiece of conversation, like<br />\neverything else in the film, is<br />\nsignificant; this leaves the movie<br />\nopen to the valid criticism that it<br />\nis overstated.<br />\nThe man is socially and<br />\nintellectually superior to the<br />\nwoman and he never lets her'<br />\nforget this. Paul and Danielle.<br />\nGegauff are married in the real<br />\nworld, have written the script,and portray the couple in<br />\nChabrol's reel world. To most<br />\nAmerican audiences they seem to,<br />\nbe a married couple because they<br />\nlive as any married couple might,<br />\nand it is a surprise to discover<br />\nthat their eight years and one<br />\nchild have been without a<br />\nwedding license. These actors<br />\nbring conviction to every line;<br />\nwhen Esther says,\"I don't care,\"<br />\nwe are intensely aware of the<br />\nfury which she can barely<br />\nconceal. She has been a loyal<br />\nbedmate and homemaker. He, on<br />\nthe other hand, has been a firm.<br />\nbeliever in the double standard.<br />\nIn bed with Esther, Philip brags<br />\nthat he has been unfaithful six<br />\ntimes; when he asks if she has<br />\nhad any affairs, she replies,\"You<br />\nknow I haven't.\"<br />\nPhilip tells Esther that he.<br />\nwouldn't mind if she had an<br />\naffair. He doesn't really expect<br />\nher to accept the offer; he seems<br />\nconfident that she will remain his<br />\nconcubine.<br />\n\"Never,\" she replies to his.<br />\noffer.<br />\n\"You should,\" he insists.<br />\n\"What?\"<br />\n\"Sleep with another guy. To<br />\nsome, sleeping around means<br />\ncheating. Let's prove it's not.\"<br />\nThough they still live in the<br />\ncountry they make attempts at a<br />\nmore cosmopolitan existence;<br />\nEst her meets a man named<br />\nHabib. just returned from Tokyo,<br />\na man who's always \"with it.\" At<br />\na dinner party Philip tells his wife<br /><br />\nto \"keep your apron on;\" there is<br />\nan obvious discrepancy between<br />\nthe fashionable attitudes they<br />\nprofess and the lives they<br />\ncontinue to lead.<br />\nAfter the party has ended,<br />\nPhilip wakes up in bed, doesn't<br /><br />\nfind his woman by his side, and<br />\ngoes downstairs, where he<br />\noverhears Esther and Habib.<br />\nFollowing them upstairs he looks<br />\nfirst in his room, expecting<br />\nthem to commit the act in his<br />\nvery bed. Not finding them, he<br />\nascends to the third floor and<br />\nenters his daughter's room.<br />\n(Esther has become corrupted,<br />\nbut his daughter Elise is still a<br />\nfaithful and innocent female. It<br />\nis, of course, significant that<br />\nPhilip calls both Esther and Elise<br />\n\"my little llama.\") Touching<br />\nElise on the nose, he calls her<br />\n'my darling angel.\" He can hear<br />\nEsther's orgasmic \"Again, again,\"<br />\nand Habib's \"Such soft skin.\"<br />\nThe next morning Philip takes<br />\na rose to Esther, brings her<br />\nbreakfast in bed, and tells her<br />\nthat \"You got a llama's nose.\"<br />\nThese are traditional ways in<br />\nwhich a man tries to keep a<br />\nwoman in bondage. Only a few<br />\ndays before he had suggested<br />\nbreaking these very bonds. Esther<br />\nsays that she is glad to be a llama<br />\n\"if it makes you happy.\" Like<br />\nBertolucci in \"Last Tango in<br />\nParis,\" Chabrol raises questions<br />\nabout the politics of sexual<br />\nfreedom: Can people handle<br />\ncomplete sexual freedom? Do<br />\nthey even want to be free?<br />\nMarriage is a legal bond; the<br />\nfact that they are not married<br />\nremoves this bond, but they live<br />\nas a married couple does, and<br />\nconsequently their<br />\nresponsibilities toward one<br />\nanother are the same as those of<br />\na married couple. Their situation<br />\nis ambiguous in that they have<br />\nthe moral responsibilities of.<br /><br />\nmarriage but are not legally<br />\nobligated to fulfill these<br />\nresponsibilities. They are<br />\nexperimenting with slavery and<br />\nfreedom; they never realize either<br />\none, but continue to vacillate<br />\nfrom one to the other.<br /><br />\nWhile shopping, he criticizes<br />\nher pronunciation of<br />\n\"chocolate,\" to which she<br />\nresponds, \"Next time I'll shop<br />\nalone,\" and then she deliberately<br />\nsays \"schocolate.\"<br />\nPhilip has ordered that sex not<br />\nbe restricted to one partner, arid<br />\nshe,so long restrained by her role<br />\nof wife, responds as Philip has<br />\ntold her. As they lie in bed and<br />\ndiscuss their affairs, their voices<br />\nare restrained, their faces nearly<br />\nexpressionless. He asks,<br />\nseemingly out of intellectual<br />\ncuriosity, if she has ever slept<br />\nwith Habib.<br />\n\"Yes.\"<br />\n\"So... He's a good lay.\"<br />\n\"Great.\"<br />\n\"In love with him?\"<br />\n\"You crazy? I like him, that's<br />\nall.\"<br />\n\"We promised to tell all.\"<br />\n\"Sure.\"<br />\n\"Other guys and girls are<br />\npreventive medicine.\"<br />\nThey want to believe, or at<br />\nleast profess to believe, that<br />\nsleeping around will bring them<br />\ncloser together. But when they<br />\nattempt to treat sex casually,<br />\nthey find that they are incapable<br />\nof maintaining serious<br />\nrelationships.<br />\nIn the ensuing confusion, there<br />\nis always the danger that the<br />\nparticipants in these sexual<br />\nexperiments will slip back into<br />\nthe well-known, and perhaps<br />\nmore secure traditional roles. As<br />\nthey drive down a road he tells<br />\nher that \"The future means<br />\ndeath.\" Chabrol makes this drive<br />\ntoward complete freedom a<br />\ndeadly one. Philip continues to<br /><br />\nboast that \"I taught her good<br />\ntaste;\" he has a way of keeping<br />\nher in line sexually: \"I'll fuck her<br />\nup all evening;\" and in front of<br />\ntheir friends he continually<br />\norders her to \"Pour me another<br />\ndrink.\" His fashionable liberalism<br /><br />\ncaused him to insist upon total<br />\nsexual freedom, but lie never<br />\ndoes believe in this. Having<br />\nforced freedom upon Esther, he<br />\nimmediately regrets having done<br />\nso. When he talks to Esther now,<br />\nhe tries to convince her that<br />\nfreedom is undesirable.<br />\n\"Freedom is the anxiety of<br />\nsolitude,\" he says. \"Slavery<br />\nmeans security.\"<br />\nBut Esther, despite her own<br />\ndoubts as to what she sould do<br />\nwith this newly -discovered<br />\nfreedom, is convinced that she<br />\nwill never return to slavery; she<br />\nrefuses to be his llama.<br />\nSleeping around becomes a<br />\nweapon. Esther tells Philip that if<br /><br />\nhe sleeps with Annie she will<br />\nsleep with Habib. Philip's<br />\ngrowing impotency in controlling<br />\nEsther is soon supplemented bY<br />\nphysical impotence. He tells<br />\nAnnie, \"I'm really ashamed.\" His<br />\nbody and his words have become<br />\nimpotent.<br />\n\"I love you,\" he tells Annie.<br />\n\"Liar,\" she responds.<br />\n\"I want to love you.\"<br />\n\"That's not the same.\"<br />\n\"I wonder.\"<br />\nThe film makes a jump here'<br />\nThis is a jump in the direction of<br />\nthe plot, because Chabrol's<br />\nthematic progression is steady.<br />\nEsther delcares that \"We need<br />\na change.\" Neither is satisfied<br />\nwith their current situation.<br />\nPhilip's main reservation is that if<br />\nthey were to move from their<br />\nrural manse to Paris, he would<br />\nlose what little control he still<br />\nhad over Esther. This is why he<br />\nobjects . . . \"But I feel as if I was<br />\nborn here.\" Traditional roles are<br />\nassociated with traditional sytles<br />\nof life and places of habitation.<br />\nHis fears are well-founded. In the<br />\ncountry, she had no one but the<br />\n\"with it\" Habib, but now she will<br />\nhave all of Paris to tempt her.

The incumbent<br />\nwill not capture Baltimore in the upcoming election. Instead<br />\nhe will concentrate on the Maryland suburbs and rural areas,<br />\nwhere \"walk around\" money is ineffective.

Beall has smartly<br />\nelected to save badly needed campaign funds rather than<br />\nuselessly does out on a seemingly lost cause.<br />\nWhile \"walk around\" -money is a topic for debate, it is not<br />\nthe overwhelmingly obvious evil which Beall and persuaded<br />\nmedia accomplices would have the public believe.

Eisenhowei<br />\nSymposium, 1976: The Question<br />\nof Freedom, we feel that several<br />\npoints could prove misleading to<br />\nthe student body. We would like<br />\nto correct these, if possible.<br />\n1) \"(The co-chairmen) have<br />\nchosen a number of relatively<br />\nunknown speakers, hoping that<br />\nthis would be beneficial for<br />\nattracting a larger, less-qiased<br />\naudience.\" To begin with, we<br />\nhave arranged for such eminent<br />\nspeakers as Noam Chomsky,<br />\nwhose work in Linguistics has<br />\nrevolutionized that field, with far<br />\nreaching consequences in<br />\nphilosophy, psychology, and<br />\npolitical science; Michael<br />\nHarrington, author of The Other<br />\nAmerica, whose latest book, The<br />\nTwilight of Capitalism has<br />\nreceived enthusiastic reviews<br />\nfrom all sides, and Rollo May,<br />\nwho developed the concept of<br />\nExistential Psychology. All in all,<br />\nwe are bringing to campus sonic<br />\nof the most consistently<br />\nexcellent speakers in recent<br />\nmemory. few of whom could be<br />\nconsidered \"lesser known\".<br />\nMoreover, we have no desire to<br />\ncontrol the temperment of the<br />\naudience. as our speakers are<br />\nperfectly capable of fending for<br />\nthemselves.<br /><br />\n2) We have chosen to utilize a<br />\nlecture format not because it is<br />\ntraditional, but because we feel it<br />\nprovides the best means for the<br />\nspeaker to express his views<br />\nsuccinctly. In addition, we are<br />\nhoping to arrange a panel<br />\ndiscussion on the subject of<br />\nacademic freedom. To the best of<br />\nour knowledge, this will be the<br />\nfirst panel ever conducted during<br />\nan Eisenhower Symposium.<br />\n3) Just as a note of<br />\ninformation, Yvonne Burke, U.S.<br />\nRepresentative trom California,.<br />\nwill be speaking at 7:00 p.m.<br />\nTuesday in Shriver Hall. Mrs.<br />\nBurke is intelligent, articulate,<br />\nand one of the finest speakers we<br />\nhave been fortunate enough to<br />\nwitness. To those who are<br />\npresent we can guarantee an<br />\nexcellent and informative lecture.<br />\nFinally, I would like to say<br />\nthat the Eisenhower Symposium<br />\nis today considered one of the<br />\nmost important symposia of its<br />\nkind in the nation.

But as with<br />\nMost \"good causes\", expenses<br />\nOften surpass the funds available<br />\nand there is a constant search to<br />\nfind the money necessary to<br />\nContinue.<br />\n\"The Tutorial Project actually<br />\nc onsist? of three separate<br />\nPrograms<br />\n0<br />\na out fi ft<br /><br />\nchildren each from various parts<br />\nof Baltimore,\" explained David<br />\nFishkin, the Chaplain's Office<br />\ncoordinator of the Project. Each<br />\nweek the children receive three<br />\nhours of strictly one-to-one<br />\ntutoring with additional cultural<br />\nor recreational activities also<br />\nplanned. The primary purpose of<br />\nthe tutoring is to improve the<br />\nchildren's basic skills in math and<br />\nreading. Fishkin also cited an<br />\nimproved attitude toward<br />\nacademic learning, the<br />\nopportunity to relate closely<br />\nwith a non-family adult, and<br />\nhigher self-esteem as other<br />\nbenefits a child receives form the<br />\ninstruction.<br />\nPerhaps the main problem that<br />\nhas plagued the Tutorial Project<br />\nin past years has been the<br />\noccasional lack of good teaching<br />\nexperiences. Sometimes the<br />\ntutor-child relationship would<br />\nwork in the social and<br />\nrecreational spheres, but fall<br />\nshort in the area of actual<br />\nlearning. Fishkin admitted that<br />\nthere have been deficiencies in<br />\nteaching in the past and blames<br />\nthem on a lack of structure in the<br />\neducational relationship. \"Most<br />\nstudents have the potential to be<br />\ngood tutors,\" asserted Fishkin,<br />\n\"but they need more guidance<br />\nthan they have received in the<br />\npast.

They are<br />\ndefensive halfback Brian Coulter,<br />\ndefensive safety and tight end<br />\nMike Rhodey and tailback Brett<br />\nMiles. Each of these players has a<br />\nvast amount of football<br />\nexperience and can use this when<br />\ndealing with their teammates.<br /><br />\nbe the leader of the<br />\nteam\u2014something best<br />\naccomplished by his own<br />\nexample.<br />\nThe second half of the role of<br />\nthe captain, according to Brian, is<br />\nto be a liason man between the<br />\ncoaches and the players. It's<br />\nnecessary for someone to be able<br />\nto transmit problems,<br />\nsuggestions, etc. within the team<br />\nframework and this job falls to<br />\nthe captain.<br />\nCoulter is optimistic about the<br />\ncoming season. He feels that the<br />\nteam is playing with a great deal<br />\nof emotion and that a winning<br />\nseason should be easily<br />\naccomplished.<br />\nRhodey<br /><br />\nCoulter<br />\nCoulter is an environmental<br />\nengineering major from<br />\nWillmington, Delaware and<br />\nwould like to attend law school<br />\nUpon graduation. He's been<br />\ncompeting in organized football<br />\nsince the fourth grade and has<br />\nalways basically been a defensive<br />\nhalfback.<br />\nHe feels that the job of the<br />\ncaptain is twofold. One part is to<br /><br />\nMike Rhodey has also been an<br />\nactive football player since the<br />\nfourth grade. However, the<br />\nversatile social and behavioral<br />\nscience major from Timonium<br />\nhas played a variety of positions.<br />\nHe was a quarterback in high<br />\nschool and came to JHU<br />\nexpecting to continue at that<br />\nposition. But he soon became a<br />\nhalfback and finally ended up at<br />\nsafety this year while also playing<br /><br />\nsome tight end.<br />\nMike feels that, as a captain,<br />\nhis primary job is leadership<br />\nthrough example. If the present<br />\npositive attitude can be<br />\nmaintained, he contends, there's<br />\nno reason why this can't be one<br />\nof the best years in recent Blue<br />\nJay football.<br />\nHe is also encouraged by the<br />\ntype of athlete who is out for the<br />\nteam this year. Unlike the past<br />\nfew years, the members of the<br /><br />\n1976 squad want to just go out<br />\nonto the field, have fun and win.<br />\nMiles<br />\nBrett Miles can be described as<br />\nsomewhat of an international<br />\nathlete. He played high school as<br />\na quarterback in Heidelberg,<br />\nGermany, where he was a three<br />\nyear varsity starter.<br />\nHowever, when he arrived at<br />\nHopkins, the social and<br />\nbehavioral science major did not<br /><br />\nplay football in his freshman and<br />\nsophomore years. His first season<br />\nof intercollegiate action was last<br />\nyear, when he played quite<br />\neffectively as a tailback.<br />\nMiles believes that there is a<br />\ngreat deal of responsibility<br />\nattached to the job of team<br />\ncaptain. The captain must be a<br />\nleader in every respect, helping to<br />\nbuild morale and making<br />\niecisions affecting the team.<br />\nHe is impressed by the positive<br />\nattitude on this year's squad and<br />\nthe emphasis on teamwork. The<br />\nfreshmen especially have been<br />\nmade to feel at home and as a<br />\npart of the team.<br />\nBrett is very optimistic about<br />\nthe upcoming season.<br />\n\"We should definitely have a<br />\nwinning season,\" he claims. \"It's<br />\njust a question of how many wins<br />\nwe'll have.\"<br />\nThe captains will lead the Jays<br />\nagainst Franklin and Marshall<br />\ntomorrow afternoon as they<br />\nopen their home schedule.

Although JHU goalie Coco<br />\nLackey had made several<br />\nexcellent saves, the inability of<br />\nthe defense to clear th'e ball<br />\ndownfield paved the way for the<br />\nscore.<br />\nThe Blue Jays came back<br />\nstrong and began to apply<br />\npressure deep in Loyola territory.<br />\nThe Hopkins offense gained<br />\ncontrol of the action and<br />\nunleashed a series of shots on the<br />\nOpposing goal.<br />\nThe Loyola goalie, realizing<br />\nthe impossibility of trying to<br />\nclear the ball without a Hopkins<br />\ninterception and goal, trapped<br />\nthe ball between her feet to stop<br /><br />\nplay. Such an intentional<br />\nstoppage of play is illegal,<br />\nhowever, and therefore a foul was<br />\ncalled on Loyola, thus awarding a<br />\npenalty shot to Hopkins.<br />\nLady Jay Coach Micul Ann<br />\nMorse selected co-captain Marty<br />\nKing to try and take advantage of<br />\nthis opportunity. However,<br />\nMarty was unable to find the<br />\nrange and the score remained 1-0<br />\nat the end of the first half.<br />\nComing out ready to win in<br />\nthe second half, the Blue Jays<br />\ncontinued to dominate play.<br />\nOnly on rare occasions did the<br />\nball cross the center line into<br />\nHopkins territory.<br />\nWith fifteen minutes having<br />\nbeen played in the second half,<br />\nJHU forward Ellen Lim spotted<br />\nthe open left corner of the net,<br />\nshot and scored. The goal was<br />\nnot only Hopkins' first of the<br />\ngame, but the first of the season<br />\nfor the Lady Jays as well. With<br />\nthe score now tied and the<br />\nmomentum seemingly in the Blue<br />\nJays favor, the Hopkins loyal<br />\nbegan readying themselves for<br />\nthe team's first victory.<br /><br />\nLoyola, however, was not<br />\nready to quit. With just four<br />\nminutes remaining in the game,<br />\nWain tallied her second goal of<br />\nthe game, putting Loyola ahead<br />\n2-1. Hopkins couldn't mount any<br />\noffense in the remaining time and<br />\nwent down to defeat.<br />\nWain, a centerforward playing<br />\nin only her second intercollegiate<br />\ngame, is considered Loyola's<br />\nmost promising player. As one of<br />\nher teammates said, she \"just<br />\nappears out of nowhere and is<br />\nalways in the right spot.\" Gena<br />\nnow has three goals in those two<br />\ngames.<br />\nAlthough they suffered a<br />\ndefeat, it was an excellent outing<br />\nfor the Blue Jays. The team has<br />\nthe talent to win and will be a<br />\ntough competitor throughout the<br />\nentire season.<br />\nRevenge against Loyola is still<br />\npossible this season. The Blue<br />\nJays have a second game<br />\nscheduled with the Greyhounds<br />\nat a later date and, according to<br />\nCoach Morse, the team \"will go<br />\nout and get them next time.\"<br /><br />\nThe nationally ranked<br />\nforced to make a kick save on an<br />\nUniversity of Delaware Blue Hens<br />\nopposing player's shot with<br />\nshut out the Blue Jay soccer<br />\ngoalie Ken Seusse out of<br />\nsquad by the score of 2-0 on<br />\nposition.<br />\nHomewood Field Wednesday<br />\nThe second half offered a night.<br />\ndifferent story as Delaware took<br />\nWeakened by the loss of backs<br />\ncomplete command and tallied<br />\nTom Myrick and Gary<br />\nboth of their goals.<br />\nIgnatowski and lineman Joe<br />\nThe first goal originated when a<br />\nSiemek the Jays were unable to<br />\nmisdirected head attempt by a<br />\nmuster enough scoring threats in<br />\nBlue Jay defender created a<br />\norder to counter the Blue Hens' breakaway for an opposing<br />\nstrong attack.<br />\nwinger.
