Thomson,<br />\n'97, Edgeworth Smith,'98, and Herman Shuter, '97. From a small, intermittent literary sheet, the paper<br />\nhas grown into a semi-weekly news<br />\norgan which holds a definite place<br />\non the campus.<br />\nIt was because of. the interest of<br />\nthis first staff and because of their<br />\nbelief that the University needed a<br />\npaper that the NEWS-LETTER put<br />\nforth its root into the campus soil.<br />\nJames M. Thomson, the first Editor-in-Chief, is, to our knowledge,<br />\nthe only editor who has followed<br />\nMr.<br />\n<br />\npublishing as a profession.<br />\n<br />\nThomson is publisher of the New<br />\nOrleans Morning Tribune, The New<br />\nOrleans Item, and The Item-Tribune. At the request of the editor,<br />\nMr. Thomson has sent the NEWS-<br />\n<br />\nLETTER some interesting facts concerning the first issues of the paper<br />\nand his connection with them. His<br />\nletter reads as follows:<br />\nDear Sir:<br />\nYour letter reaches me on<br />\nmy return to the city after<br />\nseveral weeks of absence.<br />\nI was .identified with the<br />\nfounding of the NEws-LET-<br />\n<br />\nTER, and was in the class of<br />\n'97, as was Herman Shuter,<br />\nbusiness manager of the paper.<br />\nEdgeworth Smith was in the<br />\nclass of '98. The name of the<br />\npaper, NEWS-LETTER, was his<br />\nidea. I understand that Shuter died out in the Philippines.<br />\nHe was a very attractive fellow and very popular with his<br />\nclassmates.<br />\nI was, of course, very enthusiastic about the paper. Smith<br />\nand I went one Sunday afternoon to lay the project before<br />\nthe Hem. Daniel Coit Gilman,<br />\npresident of the university, a<br />\ngreat man and a great educator.<br />\nSeveral attempts had been<br />\nmade prior . to our effort to<br />\nfound a students' paper in the<br />\ncollege. I think that our predecessors had gone about the<br />\nmatter through petition to the<br />\nfaculty or through some demand to exercise the right of<br />\n<br />\nThe<br />\n<br />\nfree printing guaranteed under<br />\nthe Constitution.<br />\nI know that I was considerably frightened, and I imagine<br />\nthat Dr. Gilman must have<br />\nthought Smith and I were two<br />\nmild youths who could do little<br />\nharm with a newspaper. At<br />\nany rate, he told us that he saw<br />\nno objection to our starting the<br />\npaper but would take the matter up with the authorities and<br />\nwould let us know definitely at<br />\na later date. No objection<br />\nwas presented and the paper<br />\nwas launched.<br />\nI do not need to tell students<br />\nat Hopkins who are having<br />\ntheir first experience with<br />\nprinters' ink of the thrill which<br />\nSmith and Shuter and I experienced when the first issue<br />\nof the NEWS-LETTER came<br />\nfrom the presses.<br />\nI think we ran the paper for<br />\nsomthing like half a year, and<br />\nit is My recollection that it was<br />\nforty dollars in debt when I<br />\nsevered connection with it on<br />\ngraduating from the college.<br />\nThere must have been a need<br />\nfor it, because it has lived.<br />\nWhen I last saw an issue of<br />\nthe NEWS-LETTER it had<br />\ngrown to a very healthy size.<br />\nSmith worked with printers'<br />\nink for some time. He went<br />\ninto the advertising business<br />\nand was connected with the<br />\nArmy and Navy Journal.<br />\nWhen I last heard of him he<br />\nwas a successful real estate<br />\nman in New York City.<br />\nShuter was a lovable fellow<br />\nand Smith was one of the most<br />\nattractive and lovable boys that<br />\nI have ever known. He had<br />\nquite a talent for music, for<br />\ndrawing and for the arts.<br />\nPrinters' ink always exercised a great fascination for<br />\nme. I had my first experience<br />\nwith the NEWS-LETTER. I was<br />\npreparing to study law; but felt<br />\nso strongly the desire to work<br />\nfor a newspaper that I quit<br />\nlaw, went to Washington and<br />\nbegan newspaper work as a reporter<br />\nPost.<br />\n<br />\non<br />\n<br />\nthe<br />\n<br />\nWashington<br />\n<br />\nI have been at news-<br />\n<br />\npaper work ever since.<br />\nWith kindest regards, I am,<br />\nSincerely yours,<br />\n<br />\nJAMES<br />\n<br />\nM.

Thomson,<br />\n'97, Edgeworth Smith,'98, and Herman Shuter, '97. From a small, intermittent literary sheet, the paper<br />\nhas grown into a semi-weekly news<br />\norgan which holds a definite place<br />\non the campus.<br />\nIt was because of. the interest of<br />\nthis first staff and because of their<br />\nbelief that the University needed a<br />\npaper that the NEWS-LETTER put<br />\nforth its root into the campus soil.<br />\nJames M. Thomson, the first Editor-in-Chief, is, to our knowledge,<br />\nthe only editor who has followed<br />\nMr.<br /><br />\npublishing as a profession.<br /><br />\nThomson is publisher of the New<br />\nOrleans Morning Tribune, The New<br />\nOrleans Item, and The Item-Tribune. At the request of the editor,<br />\nMr. Thomson has sent the NEWS-<br /><br />\nLETTER some interesting facts concerning the first issues of the paper<br />\nand his connection with them. His<br />\nletter reads as follows:<br />\nDear Sir:<br />\nYour letter reaches me on<br />\nmy return to the city after<br />\nseveral weeks of absence.<br />\nI was .identified with the<br />\nfounding of the NEws-LET-<br /><br />\nTER, and was in the class of<br />\n'97, as was Herman Shuter,<br />\nbusiness manager of the paper.<br />\nEdgeworth Smith was in the<br />\nclass of '98. The name of the<br />\npaper, NEWS-LETTER, was his<br />\nidea. I understand that Shuter died out in the Philippines.<br />\nHe was a very attractive fellow and very popular with his<br />\nclassmates.<br />\nI was, of course, very enthusiastic about the paper. Smith<br />\nand I went one Sunday afternoon to lay the project before<br />\nthe Hem. Daniel Coit Gilman,<br />\npresident of the university, a<br />\ngreat man and a great educator.<br />\nSeveral attempts had been<br />\nmade prior . to our effort to<br />\nfound a students' paper in the<br />\ncollege. I think that our predecessors had gone about the<br />\nmatter through petition to the<br />\nfaculty or through some demand to exercise the right of<br /><br />\nThe<br /><br />\nfree printing guaranteed under<br />\nthe Constitution.<br />\nI know that I was considerably frightened, and I imagine<br />\nthat Dr. Gilman must have<br />\nthought Smith and I were two<br />\nmild youths who could do little<br />\nharm with a newspaper. At<br />\nany rate, he told us that he saw<br />\nno objection to our starting the<br />\npaper but would take the matter up with the authorities and<br />\nwould let us know definitely at<br />\na later date. No objection<br />\nwas presented and the paper<br />\nwas launched.<br />\nI do not need to tell students<br />\nat Hopkins who are having<br />\ntheir first experience with<br />\nprinters' ink of the thrill which<br />\nSmith and Shuter and I experienced when the first issue<br />\nof the NEWS-LETTER came<br />\nfrom the presses.<br />\nI think we ran the paper for<br />\nsomthing like half a year, and<br />\nit is My recollection that it was<br />\nforty dollars in debt when I<br />\nsevered connection with it on<br />\ngraduating from the college.<br />\nThere must have been a need<br />\nfor it, because it has lived.<br />\nWhen I last saw an issue of<br />\nthe NEWS-LETTER it had<br />\ngrown to a very healthy size.<br />\nSmith worked with printers'<br />\nink for some time. He went<br />\ninto the advertising business<br />\nand was connected with the<br />\nArmy and Navy Journal.<br />\nWhen I last heard of him he<br />\nwas a successful real estate<br />\nman in New York City.<br />\nShuter was a lovable fellow<br />\nand Smith was one of the most<br />\nattractive and lovable boys that<br />\nI have ever known. He had<br />\nquite a talent for music, for<br />\ndrawing and for the arts.<br />\nPrinters' ink always exercised a great fascination for<br />\nme. I had my first experience<br />\nwith the NEWS-LETTER. I was<br />\npreparing to study law; but felt<br />\nso strongly the desire to work<br />\nfor a newspaper that I quit<br />\nlaw, went to Washington and<br />\nbegan newspaper work as a reporter<br />\nPost.<br /><br />\non<br /><br />\nthe<br /><br />\nWashington<br /><br />\nI have been at news-<br /><br />\npaper work ever since.<br />\nWith kindest regards, I am,<br />\nSincerely yours,<br /><br />\nJAMES<br /><br />\nM.
