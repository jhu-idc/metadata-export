Formerly, these texts were<br />\navailable on a circulating basis<br />\n(except, of course, for<br />\nnon-circulating reference<br />\nmaterials) but, because of their<br />\nvalue to students, they often<br />\ndisappeared soon after their<br />\npurchase. Thus students who<br />\ncame to Hutzler seeking a<br />\nspecific and often crucial text,<br />\nsuch as Lehninger or the CRC<br />\nHandbook, could never depend<br />\nupon finding it on the shelves.

Still, according to the<br />\nUniversity's general counsel,<br />\nEstelle A.

Similarly, the<br />\nmarijuana laws have been seen by some (e.g., Garry Wills) as<br />\na means of persecuting the lower class urban dweller, while<br />\nthe upper class suburbanites are rarely bothered.<br />\nMost recently, President Carter engaged in an action<br />\nwhich discriminates not only against class but against sex.<br />\nBy restricting the use of Federal Health funding to disclude<br />\nabortions. Carter has sought to enforce a moral decision '<br />\nagainst a legalistic problem, and in ding so, has attempted'<br />\nto decide the morality of a question for others.<br />\nIn a nutshell, our position is this: If Medical aid is the<br />\nright of every individual (and, indeed, this seems to be the<br />\nGovernment's position as well; viz. Medicare, HEW, etc.),<br />\nthen anymedical operation which is legal in the United<br />\nStates should be available to all citizens. So long as the<br />\ngovernment condones abortion with legality, it is clarly<br />\ndiscriminatory to deny it to those unable to afford it.<br />\nThe issue here is not whether abortion is moral. The<br />\nRight to Life movement should direct their energies to the<br />\nrepeal of the abortion laws, not the repeal of Federal<br />\nfunding. President Carter should realize that morality<br />\ncannot be legislated, either through direct or indirect<br />\nmeans.<br />\n<br />\nEmployment<br />\n<br />\nFeatures Editors<br />\nMike Deak<br />\nMike Giuliano<br />\n<br />\nBusiness Staff<br />\nMark 1Polkow<br />\nElliot Grover<br />\n<br />\nSports Editor<br />\nAndrew Cohen<br />\n<br />\nNews Editor<br />\nRobert Riggs<br />\n<br />\nPhotography<br />\nJennifer Bishop<br />\n<br />\nManaging Editor<br />\nDavid Hawk<br />\nProduction<br />\nRhona Lyons<br />\n\"Mystery\"<br />\n.

In that age,<br />\ninquisitions and religious wars were, in the first<br />\nplace, political perversions of an existential<br />\nstandpoint created by a man who frustrated the<br />\nhopes of his contemporaries by insisting that His.<br />\nkingdom was not of this world; and, in any event,<br />\nmodernity can make no claims to comparative<br />\ninnocence. Our age of rationalism, of \"scientific\"<br />\nideology, is curiously simultaneous with terrorism,<br />\ntotalitarianism, and destructive revolution on an<br />\nunprecedented scale. Science has so completely<br />\nfailed to substantiate anyone's humanistic optimism<br />\nthat its apotheosis is now virtually unheard of. This<br />\ndevelopment has to do not only with the fact that<br />\nscience is the matrix of destructive capacity as well<br />\nas constructive capacity, but with the fact that<br />\n\"scientific\" analysis brooks no distinctively religious<br />\nproblems as such in human subjectivity. Rather, it<br />\nattempts to analyze these \"prima facie\" religious<br />\nproblems into something else, reducing them, in<br />\nnot<br />\neffect, to something that they are<br />\nradical empiricism;<br />\nexperienced as. This is not<br />\nit is, rather the ideologizing of man,and it does not<br />\nwork.<br />\nIt is the death of man. The modern secular<br />\npsychological project, beginning most dramatically<br />\nwith psychoanalysis in the late nineteenth century,<br />\nrooted itself in the rejection of the inexplicable face<br />\nof experience in a search for its mechanistic guts.<br />\nThis was a rejection of the radically experiential<br />\nmethod of defining man for ideological ways of<br />\ndoing so. The point is that man experiences<br />\nfreedom, guilt, responsibility, transcendence, and,<br />\ntraditionally in the West, these were viewed not as<br />\nillusions, but rather as the foundational realities of<br />\nMan. With the advent of modern scientific analysis<br />\nwe adopted the assumption that we are simply<br />\nfooled into believing these things about ourselves;<br />\nthe methodological assumption of a hopefully<br />\ncomprehensive science was that everything had a<br />\ncause. Thus we ended up explaining ourselves in<br />\nterms of an ideological determinism which we could<br />\nnot observe and rejecting the freedom, guilt,<br />\nresponsibility, and transcendence which we could<br />\nobserve.<br />\nNow I certainly think that there is something<br />\ndefinitely specious about this, especially insofar as<br />\nwe are the ones who come up with the ideology. It<br />\nis not that I reject the causal foundations of natural<br />\nscience, but rather that I reject this foundation as a<br />\ncomprehensive view of things. It seems odd to apply<br />\nit to a consciousness which objectifies the causal<br />\nnexus and seems always in a position to break it<br />\nonce it is known. Sartre, of course, would agree.<br />\nMan, from a radically experiential standpoint, is<br />\nfreedom.<br />\nBut it is not this rather abstruse philosophical<br />\ninsight which has broken down psychoanalysis in<br />\nless than one hundred years; rather, I am inclined to<br />\nbelieve it is the latter's comparative therapeutic<br />\nfailure. Today the psychiatrist often deals in<br />\n\"reality therapy,\" or \"logo-therapy,\" in which the<br />\nface of subjective experience is accepted and the<br />\npatient is expected to own up to freedom,<br />\nresponsibility, and the necessity of decisions leading<br />\nto meaning:We live in an era in which a Carl Becker<br />\nunderstands all human behavior as an existential<br />\nstrategy for escaping death, death as subjective<br />\nnothingness, meaninglessness, valuelessness, and<br />\nlovelessness. All of which goes to say that we are<br />\nturning back to ourselves instead of paying homage<br />\nto \"scientific\" ideology.<br />\nBut this revolution 114s.only just begun and the<br />\naverage modern man has not even begun to digest its<br />\n<br />\nTwo days ago, as a part of Full Employment Week, the<br />\nInterdenominational Minesterial Alliance and the<br />\nAFL-CIO staged rallies at City Hall and Center Plaza in an<br />\nattempt to call public attention to the current high rate of<br />\nunemployment, particularly among blacks. More than<br />\nTwenty Baltimore ministers, among them Chaplain<br />\nChester Wickwire, presented a staement which accused<br />\nour national leaders of \"committing themselves to the<br />\nproposition of maintaining high rates of unemployment to<br />\noffset the rising price levels attendant to inflation.\" Such<br />\na policy, of course, shows a crass disregard for the lives of<br />\nthose unemployed. Particularly hard hit is the Black<br />\ncommunity, where the unemployment rate is around 14%.<br />\nThe percentage of unemployed black adolescents averages<br />\n35% and is as high as 70% . In fact, Baltimore ranks<br />\nsecond to Detroit in its rate of unemployment among<br />\nblack teenagers. The IMA is asking that ;ndividuals write<br />\nletters to President Carter and to Representative Parren<br />\nMitchell expressing their concern. Among other things,<br />\nthey hope that the office of Revenue Sharing will<br />\ninvestigate the use of federal funds in our city and state to<br />\nevaluate their availability and use for the needy.<br />\nDr. Wickwire stressed that \"we shouldn't be dealing with<br />\neconomic problems in terms of inflation, but dealing with<br />\nthem in terms of people.\" He went on to criticize the lack<br />\nof social concern at Hopkins. \"How far removed we are<br />\non campus from what's going on down in the city. We're<br />\nso isolated from what's going on on the other side of<br />\nNorth Avenue.\" This coming Sunday, ministers<br />\nthroughout the city will ask their congregations to write<br />\nthe President. On campus, Dr. Wickwire hopes that within<br />\nthe next few days individuals will write letters to Carter<br />\nand then drop them off at the office of the Chaplain,<br />\nwhere, sometime early next week, the hopefully large<br />\n.<br />\n.<br />\nrarliral inpvitabilitipc (1nrp mnriprn mnn<br />\ntho<br />\nstack of mail will be given to the Postal Service. We<br />\nurgeChaPlain will find that the sort of public program<br />\nA students and faculty members to add to the stack.<br />\nthat he seems to presently promote is hopelessly<br />\nY kJ<br />\n<br />\nnon-religious and therefore uninteresting to religious<br />\npeople as such. The aesthetic surface of a chaplain's<br />\nprogram which is constituted out of religion<br />\ncourses, ostensibly stuffy seminars about<br />\n\"individual and societal growth\" or \"issues in health<br />\ncare delivery,\" and volunteer work which could as<br />\nwell be provided by an Office of Mundane<br />\nrecherche \"relevance.\" But it is also the reduction<br />\nof religion to good anthropology, good ethics, good<br />\npolitics, and good humanism; and as good as it all is,<br />\nit is merely paltry when placed beside Christ's<br />\nradical denial of subjective death - this being the<br />\nmost sublime religious issue in life.<br />\nThere is no morally authentic humanism in a man<br />\n(there is no strength for it) until he has solved the<br />\nirreducibly and distinctively religious problem of<br />\nlife as a personal abyss in which there is the failure<br />\nto instantiate value, radical contingency, a dearth of<br />\nhope and love, and an abiding despair that he can<br />\nonly run from. The Chaplain's public program<br />\nseems, in the face of this, religiously irrelevant another manifestation of the impoverished modern<br />\nemphasis: the relation of ideology to man and man<br />\nto man rather than, firstly, the relation of man to<br />\nhis own subjectivity and consequently to God. It<br />\nexcludes the religiously fundamental search for a<br />\nhealthy subjective authenticity. Thus the Chaplain<br />\nseems to offer us one more moment in the silence of<br />\nGod, unless a course on \"individual growth\" is more<br />\nthan ideological.<br />\nHegel pointed out that the dialectical product of<br />\nGod's death is not the promotion of man, but,<br />\nrather, the deification of Death itself. But the<br />\nscientific age has only \"killed\" God as a necessary<br />\naspect of limited scientific explanations as such and<br />\ncannot, even in principle, \"kill\" him as a moral<br />\nn.ecesity,. not an ultimate explanation. Still, even if<br />\nthe \"death of God\" cannot be produced<br />\nscientifically and is actually identical with ignorance<br />\nof God,the practical effect is not that man becomes<br />\nGod but, once again, that Death becomes God. The<br />\nuniverse not only remains ultimately inexplicable to<br />\nman, but his history becomes a reign of terror. One<br />\nhundred years ago Zarathustra came out of the hills<br />\nto announce the death of God (albeit, too early);<br />\nOrwell and Huxley, in their more recent<br />\npronouncement were much more modest: they<br />\nmerely descried the death of Man (albeit, too late).<br />\nThe seemingly manufactured \"relevance\" of<br />\ncontemporary \"religion\" is no resurrection,for it<br />\ndoes not return us to the face of human subjectivity<br />\n(nor consequently to the face of God.)<br />\nStill, this exact moment of the age remains<br />\nuncertain, not clearly a decision to remain with<br />\nDeath, palling of its own tawdriness. It has squeezed<br />\nthe magnitude out of everything, including sex,<br />\nmarriage, and childbearing. In doing so it waters an<br />\nalready rooted existential rebellion in human nature<br />\nwhich cannot long bear the total absence of the<br />\ngoodness accruing frOm the fulfillment of moral<br />\nduty. The contemporary man's and woman's<br />\ntotalitarian and loveless behavior toward their own<br />\nunborn children is perhaps the most repulsive and<br />\nextreme selfishness teleologically implied by the<br />\ndeath of all moral authority - the death of God. The<br />\nugliness, the hollowness, the simple moral<br />\nbankruptcy of the West is now unendurable. What<br />\nwe shall probably have to protect ourselves against<br />\nin the next tens to twenty years is the fascist<br />\npotential in the inevitable human reaction to it. We<br />\nwill have to insure that the form this reaction takes<br />\nis not politically or religiously authoritarian, but a<br />\nmatter of religious grace. In this sense, Christ is the<br />\nmodel for authority. Nevertheless, this is not a<br />\nmodel of innocuous piety, for Christ the tiger (as<br />\nEliot put it) subjectively radicalizes men and women<br />\nin the face of Death.<br />\n--Thomas A.

Thus<br />\nno real growth in the collection<br />\ncould be achieved. With the new<br />\nsecurity plan and a sizeable grant<br />\nfor new purchases in the offing,<br />\nthe Hutzler collection will<br />\nimprove in both size and quality.<br />\nMs. Baker has concentrated much<br />\neffort into weeding out less<br />\nneeded books in order to make<br />\nroom for volumes in greater<br />\ndemand.<br />\nThe library paid eighteen<br />\nhundred dollars for the detection<br />\ndevice this year, and will<br />\ncontinue to make smaller<br />\npayments on it for the next four<br />\nyears. After the first five years, a<br />\ntwo hundred dollar service charge<br />\nmust be paid each year. When a<br />\nsensitized book is detected by<br />\nthe machine, an alarm, much like<br />\n<br />\nthat sounded at the Eisenhower<br />\nlibrary before closing, is<br />\nactivated, and the exit gate locks<br />\nso the person cannot leave. The<br />\nstudent will be asked to search<br />\nhis belongings to determine if he<br />\nhas accidentally included a<br />\nHutzler book. It is understood<br />\nand expected that a number of<br />\nindividuals will leave with books<br />\nunintentionally, merely<br />\nforgetting that they belong to the<br />\nlibrary.<br />\nSince the reading room is open<br />\ntwenty four hours, no<br />\ninconvenience should result from<br />\nthe decision to put these books<br />\non non -circulating status. As<br />\nmost students can attest, there is<br />\nnothing more frustrating than<br />\nrunning over to Hutzler at four<br />\no'clock in the morning to cram<br />\nfor a test or finish a paper and<br />\nfind that the book you've been<br />\nusing has disappeared. Now, with<br />\nan effective security system and a<br />\nlittle student cooperation, these<br />\nbooks can remain in the library,<br />\n<br />\nweile, Old<br />\n<br />\n\f4 / News-Letter, Vol. 82, no. 2<br />\n<br />\nFilm Series<br />\n<br />\nBaltimore Audiences Have Choice<br />\nBY MIKE GIULIANO<br />\nThe Office of the Chaplain's Reel World, now in its<br />\nfifth year, is the biggest film series in Baltimore,<br />\npresentirig more than sixty films (roughly half<br />\nHollywood, half foreign) on Wednesday and Sunday<br />\nevenings at 7:30 p.m. All screenings are on the<br />\nHomewood campus and most are in Shriver Hall. Because<br />\nthe Reel World is well-established and reasonably wellpublicized it attracts an audience from most sections of<br />\nthe city (and even a few determined film buffs from<br />\nColumbia.)<br />\nAccording to a Reel World organizer, more residents of<br />\nthe Charles Village - Mount Vernon area than Hopkins'<br />\nstudents hold Reel World subscriptions. Particularly<br />\nunfortunate, if not surprising, is the Tact that \"very few<br />\nundergraduates take part.\" As a part of this year's<br />\nfreshman orientation program and, perhaps, also in an<br />\neffort to encourage undergraduate participation in the<br />\nseries, freshmen were admitted free to this year's opening<br />\nfilm, Charles Chaplin's Modern Times. Around one<br />\nhundred fifty freshmen took advantage of this free<br />\nadmission, and the total attendance was an encouraging<br />\nfour hundred thirty. (A Reel World presentation usually<br />\ndraws around one hundred people.)<br />\nSeries admissions are by subscription only. There are<br />\nvarious plans: sixty admissions for thirty five dollars,<br />\nthirty for twenty two dollars, twelve for ten dollars, six<br />\nfor six dollars, and four for five dollars. The next Reel<br />\nWorld presentation is Jan Kadar's Shop On Main Street, a<br />\nCzech film that has enjoyed international acclaim since its<br />\nshowing at the Czechoslovak Film Week in London in<br />\n1965; it will be shown this Sunday, September 11.<br />\nAnother Czech film, Ivan Passer's Intimate Lighting<br />\n(1967), will follow on September 14. For further<br />\ninformation call the Office of the Chaplain at 338-8187.<br />\nAnother film series, the one at the Hopkins Graduate<br />\nClub (basement of McCoy Hall), will run on Thursday<br />\nevenings at eight p.m. Unlike previous films at the Grad<br />\nClub, there will be a one dollar admission charge for this<br />\nseries, which opens on September 15 with Sidney Lumet's<br />\nLong Day's Journey Into Night.<br />\nCenter Stage (700 N. Calvert St.), encouraged by the<br />\nsuccess of its summer film program, is beginning its fall<br />\nseries on September ninth and tenth with two Esther<br />\nWilliams films: The Gang's All Here at 7:30 p.m. and<br />\nAreplune's Daughter at 9:30.

The price of admission<br />\n<br />\nis $2 for adults ($3.50 for a double feature) and one<br />\ndollar for children. Because show times often vary from<br />\nweekend to the next it's advisable to call the Center Stage<br />\nbox office at 332-0033.<br />\nThe Baltimore Film Forum also screens its films at<br />\nCenter Stage. Their programs begin at eight p.m. on<br />\nMondays. The tentative schedule is as follows: Greta<br />\nGarbo in Painted Veil on September 19; Rene Clair's The<br />\nLast- Millionaire on October 17; Claude Chabrol's Les<br />\nBiches on November 21; Werner Herzog's Even Dwarfs<br />\nStarted Small and Fata Morgana on December 19;<br />\nRouben Mamoulian's Applause on January 23; Alain<br />\nResnais' La Guerre Est Finie on February 27; Agnes<br />\nVarda's Les Creatures on March 13; and Yasujiro Ozu's<br />\nAn Autumn Afternoon on May 15. Short films, program<br />\nnotes, `post-film discussions and refreshments are<br />\nincluded. A single membership to the eight films costs<br />\ntwenty dollars; a double membership, which admits the<br />\nbearer and one guest, costs thirty five dollars; a sustaining<br />\nmembership, which admits the bearer and two guests,<br />\ncosts fifty dollars; and a student/senior citizen<br />\nmembership costs fifteen dollars.

Directed by Bob Arellano, the play was originally performed in July, with tremendous success. Allan Felix, a 29-year old film critic, suddenly finds himself single when his wife leaves to pursue a life of adventure.<br />\nonely and depressed, Allan turns to his friends Linda and Dick Christie for comfort. They fix him up with a variety of<br />\nsingle women and, as might be expected, Allan strikes out repeatedly. Humphrey Bogart, Allan's idol, appears occasionally<br />\n\"dames\" fall for him.<br />\n_<br />\nato coach him in the art of making<br />\nThe play, which was the basis for an acclaimed movie, takes place mostly in Allan's mind. These scenes are cleverly<br />\n,identified by special lighting effects and the use of the side balconies. Cliff Braverman stars as Allan Felix. Rick Vaum and<br />\n'Lisa Lystad play Allan's friends, Dick and Linda. Marc Nasdoi- shaved off his beara to play Humphrey Bogart.

It was the new band, big and<br />\nelectric, with several odd instruments, a number of young<br />\nwhites, and a formidable stack of amplifiers. In the midst<br />\nof it all, among such stars as Gary Bartz, Keith Jarrett,<br />\nand John McLaughlin, was an odd, bearded Brasillian,<br />\nwith a rather large variety of noisemakers. He would<br />\nshake them, scrape them, and do what seemed to be just<br />\nany old thing, always adding an interesting texture, but<br />\nno discernable pulse.<br />\nSometime later, a record appeared, put together by<br />\nsome of Miles old musicians. Joe Zawinul and Wayne<br />\nShorter had formed an electric, impressionist quintet<br />\ncalled Weather Report, and there in the rhythm section<br />\nwas this same Brasillian. His name was Airto Moriea, and<br />\nthis time around, he added as much color as rhythm ,<br />\nnicely rounding Al Mouzon's drumming.<br />\nStill later, Chick Corea came out with an album called<br />\nReturn To Forever. Produced by Manfred Eicher for his<br />\nECM lable, the album was quite a change from Corea's<br />\nprevious group, an exploratory hard bop ensemble<br />\nfeaturing Anthony Braxton. Along with his newly-found<br />\nleft hand, Stanley Clarke, there was Airto, this time with<br />\nhis wife, Flora Purim.<br />\nAirto and Flora were the beginning of an invasion of<br />\nwave\" Brasillian jazz, an invasion that has yet to<br />\nreach its peak. Unlike the previous Brasillian intrusions<br />\n(Samba, Bossa Nova, etc), this new wave maintains much<br />\nof its native flavor, while keeping its strictly jazz sense. It<br />\nuses a complex, contagious beat, laced under a delicate<br />\nsense of harmony and an almost Rhapsodic sense of<br />\nmelody.<br />\nAt the vanguard right now, is Milton Nascimento.<br />\nMilton is this generation's Jobim, but unlike Jobim, he<br />\ncan sing his own songs with nonpareil grace and finesse.<br />\nHe has only one album in print over here, but he has<br />\nappeared on Wayne Shorter's Native Dancer, Flora<br />\nPurim's 500 Miles High, and Airto's Promises ofthe Sun.<br />\n<br />\nnew<br />\n\"<br />\n<br />\nmodal line, easily on par with the most sohpisticated Cole<br />\nPorter melody.<br />\nMilton has nearly eighteen albums out in Brazil(or so<br />\nit has been rumored); if you can't get Geraes, anything<br />\nelse will do. Milton, like cocaine, is an acquired taste, but<br />\none that can easily become insatiable.<br />\nOn the other end of the spectrum is Hermeto<br />\nPascoal.Hermeto, unlike Milton, is more of a performer<br />\nthan a composer. Although he is a prolific writer, he is an<br />\neven more amazing soloist, able to play piano, flute,<br />\nsoprano, and guitar with equal fluidity. He has recorded<br />\nwith Miles Davis, Airto and Flora, and.Flora lists him as<br />\nher principal influence.<br />\nA disappointment, then that his only extant American<br />\nalbum is such a failure. Unfortunately, what in many<br />\nplayers would be strengths become weaknesses under the<br />\nHermeto's ability. He plays too well, and too much, the<br />\nbeing a musical offering which is almost<br />\nresult<br />\nPascoal<br />\nflute solo, Hermeto<br />\nindigestable. Some things, like Airto's prepared hog<br />\nsqueals on Missa dos Escravos or Hermeto's rambling<br />\nFurther, he wrote Turrentine's hit, \"Salt Song...\"<br />\npiano on Escuta Meu Piano, are sheer brilliance;<br />\nUnfortunately Milton's American dates have not been regrettably, the rest of the album degenerates into<br />\nas exceptional as his Brasillian sessions. For example, poinless albeit virtuosic, noodling.<br />\narc\u00b0 Marimbondo on Airto's Promises album seems<br />\nalmost leaden in comparison with Milton's Geraes album.<br />\nLikewise, Cade, which appears on a single inside<br />\nMilagre dos Peixes looses its sense of loosness when it is<br />\ntransformed into \"Fairy Tale Song.\"<br />\nNone the less, his American album is still a classic, with<br />\nAirto's brilliant percussion work off-setting Herbie<br />\non Cravo e Catzele or<br />\nHancock's sprightly piano<br />\nMilton's solitary beauty on Chamada.<br />\nThose interested in his imports should look into<br />\nGeraes. Although it is not too available locally, it can be<br />\nobtained in New York. With some of Milton's best<br />\nmaterial to date as well as surprisingly good production, it<br />\nis well worth the trip. Some of the tunes, like Prom essas<br />\ndo Sol, carry a primitive, ritualistic intensity, which is<br />\nnicely builty around folk guitars and wooden flutes.<br />\nOthers, like Nelson Angelo's Fazenda, carry a complex,<br />\n<br />\nMontezuma's Revenge<br />\nThey've played for crowds of<br />\nupwards of fifteen thousand<br />\npeople to standing ovations.<br />\nThey've worked with acts like<br />\nLoggins and Messina, Neil<br />\nSedaka, The Band, Judy Collins,<br />\nBette Midler and David Bromberg<br />\n-- delighting all these audiences.<br />\nIn small halls and large arenas all<br />\nacross the country Aztec<br />\nTwo-Step have generated a<br />\nwarmth and intensity that few<br />\nperformers can match.

With<br />\n<br />\ntheir concert tonight at nine<br />\no'clock, they should give<br />\nHopkins the same electric<br />\nperformance they have become<br />\nknown for nationwide.<br />\nFor the past few years, Rex<br />\nFowler and Neal Shulman, Aztec<br />\nTwo-Step, have been weaving a<br />\nunique patchwork of folk, rock<br />\nand country. Wherever they<br />\nperform, their loyal, fanatical<br />\nand always vocal fans come out<br />\nto support them. They have<br />\ncreated something of a legend<br />\nabout themselves. There was that<br />\nunforgettable weekend gig at The<br />\n<br />\nUnicorn in Ithaca, New York<br />\nwhere Neal and Rex set the house<br />\nattendance record. And there was<br />\nthe time they attracted fourteen<br />\nhundred devotees to the<br />\nUniversity of Rhode Island where<br />\npeople climbed through windows<br />\ntwelve feet off the ground and<br />\nliterally sat on the rafters to hear<br />\n\"Baking,\" \"Dean Moriarty\" and<br />\n\"Humpty Dumpty.\"<br />\nAztec Two-Step has been in<br />\nexistence since the summer of<br />\n1971.

The musical combination<br />\nof Neal's urban perceptions and<br />\nRex's mild, agrarian background<br />\nclicked instantly. The next day,<br />\nafter an overwhelming<br />\nperformance, they set out for the<br />\nBig Apple and a recording<br />\ncontract.<br />\nNow \"Two's Company\"<br />\nfurther realizes their vision. With<br />\nthe help of producer Mark<br />\nAbramson, whose exquisite work<br />\nwith Judy Collins is well known,<br />\nRex and Neal have found the<br />\ndelicate balance they've been<br />\nlooking for.

There is the city's<br />\nNational Public Radio affiliate,<br />\nWBJC; there is Towson State's<br />\nWCVT; and there is Morgan's<br />\ncontribution to the city's black<br />\ncommunity, WEAA. And, by the<br />\nbeginning of next term,<br />\nBaltimore will have its fourth<br />\npublic radio station, WJHU-FM.<br />\nWith their application for a<br />\nconstruction permit already<br />\ntendered, WJHU has completed<br />\nthe first step in their journey to<br />\nthe FM airwaves. The<br />\napplication, which was tendered<br />\non June tenth, must be approved<br />\nbefore any construction involving<br />\nthe FM broadcast equipment can<br />\nbe started. This way, the FCC<br />\nwould prevent any loss on the<br />\npart of a station which had<br />\nalready installed its equipment,<br />\nonly to fail in its efforts to get a<br />\nfrequency.<br />\nAccording to Chief Engineer<br />\nJud French, WJHU's application<br />\nwas virtually \"perfect,\" so they<br />\nShould have little difficulty in<br />\ngetting approval. Even though<br />\nthey have asked for a \"rush\" on<br />\nthe decision, they do not expect<br />\nto receive the dc<br />\ncision for several<br />\n(<br />\nmonths.(Mean time for approval<br />\nis nine months).<br />\nThe station has applied for<br />\n88.1 MHz, which is the only<br />\n<br />\nremaining frequency on the<br />\neducational band in Baltimore.<br />\nThis scarcity of available<br />\nfrequencies was, in fact,<br />\ninstrumental in getting funding<br />\nfor the station underway.<br />\nDr. Steven Muller, the<br />\nUniversity president, assigned<br />\nRoss Jones to evaluate funding<br />\npotential for the station, after an<br />\ninitial proposal for FM<br />\nconversion had been submitted<br />\nBecause it was the last chance the<br />\nUniversity would have at an<br />\neducational FM station, the<br />\nadministration felt that the<br />\nmatter should be dealt with<br />\nimmediately.<br />\nUnfortunately, the initial<br />\nproposal did not interest<br />\npotential funders, and was<br />\nFrench then<br />\nrejected.

Instead of handling the scoring<br />\nteam as he has in years past, Cox will turn those duties<br />\nover to assistant coach Willie Scroggs. The headcoach will<br />\nrun the defense.<br />\n\"We plan to employ a wide open offense similar to that<br />\nemployed by the University of Houston,\" explained Cox.<br />\n\"This year our fans will see a lot of option plays; passing,<br />\npitching out to the running backs, and extensive running<br />\nby the quarterback.\"<br />\nThis year's starting quarterback will be Tom Bender, a<br />\njunior from Rosedale, Maryland. It will be Bender's third<br />\nseason as the Blue Jay signal caller and Cox is expecting<br />\nbig things from this veteran. Just behind Bender stand<br />\nsenior Bob DeSimone of Plainview, New York and<br />\nsophomore Joel Hansen from Chantilly, Virginia.<br />\nThe tailback positions are aptly filled. by Ken Bess, a<br />\nsenior from Laurel, and a strong frosh candidate, Bernie<br />\nCook of Cockesville. Baltimore boy John Railey, Kevin<br />\nKeefer of Westminster, and Tom Meurer, also from<br />\nBaltimore, will take the fullback spots. Wide receivers<br />\nDave Campbell of Pikesville and Joe Devlin of Annapolis<br />\ncombined with tight-end Steve Wey of Baltimore should<br />\nstrength-en the Jay passing attack.<br />\nThe offensive line is chock full of experience with its<br />\nlist of returning lettermen: Bob Divers, Rick Law, Rick<br />\nBroadhurst, and Chuck Kennedy. A battle does exist for<br />\nthe remaining spot between freshmen Jim Hood of<br />\n<br />\nBaltimore and Ron Chesek of Dundalk, Maryland.<br />\nLooking at Defense, the guard positions seem to have<br />\nbeen secured by lettermen Ned Sacha of Baltimore and<br />\nChuck Hauck of Owings Mills, Maryland. Letterman Dave<br />\nBudzik will handle the left tackle duties while frosh Cook<br />\nand Hood battle it out for the right tackle post. Doober<br />\nAburn of Towson and Him Schoettler of Chevy Chase will<br />\nbe at the defensive end spots.<br />\nan interesting<br />\nIn the linebacker category, Cox sees<br />\nbattle developing over the two starting positions. Junior<br />\nletterman Sonny Mills, Divers, Meurer, and Keefer should<br />\nall be playing in those spots this season. John Scully of<br />\nElicott City, Maryland will take the defensive halfback<br />\npost.<br />\nThis season Cox has also expanded his kicking game,<br />\nemploying Steve Love, a junior from Thurmount,<br />\n<br />\nMarybrid, to boot field goals and kickoffs. The punting<br />\nteam will consist of Tom Meurer and John Railey. Cox is<br />\nhoping that Love's foot will add an extra scoring<br />\ndimension that he could not count on in previous year.<br />\nThe Blue Jays will scrimmage this weekend at Lebanon<br />\nValley College before opening their season the following<br />\nweek at Susquehanna University. The first home game<br />\nwill take place on Homewood Field on September 24<br />\nwhen the Jays meet Muhlenberg.<br />\nCox looks at his Middle Atlantic Conference Southern<br />\nDivision schedule as a tough one. \"Certainly, the team to<br />\nbeat is Franklin and Marshall,\" cited the head coach.<br />\n\"Widener should also offer some tough competition.\" No<br />\nmatter how tough the schedule is this year Cox fully<br />\nexpects the team to better last year's mark of 3-5-1.<br />\n<br />\nNEW SPORTS NAMES<br />\nelsh<br />\n<br />\n[B ielawski<br />\n<br />\nJohn Bielawski, a native of Sparrows Point and<br />\nTim Welsh will serve as the new head swim coach at<br />\ngraduate degree holder from Indiana State, was named<br />\nJohns Hopkins in 1977-1978.

Simms felt that this<br />\nwas an indication that his topic was something special. \"We were only<br />\nthe second symposium in eleven years to be selected by more than fifty<br />\npercent of the student body.\"<br />\n\"Television and Society,\" said Simms, will cover nearly all aspects of<br />\ntelevision -- the way it works in society, and the way the audience has<br />\ndetermined what will be on television. The average viewer will see that<br />\nhe does have an impact.\"<br />\n\"T.V. is changing society, but also society is changing itself,\" Simms<br />\ncontinued. \"Television is a mirror of society. It's a mirror that doesn't<br />\nreflect every detail \u2014 it's a mirror that collects and condenses the<br />\naspects of society that people seem to want to see.\"<br />\nThe concept of this year's program, according to Simms,is \"a critical<br />\nlook at television,\" and its objective is \"that those in attendance should<br />\nrealize the effect of T.V. on them. They should be aware that the<br />\nprogram they're seeing is only bordering on reality.\"<br />\nEach speaker will have a valid point to make about television, and its<br />\nissues. Previous symposia were criticized by Simms for placing too<br />\nmuch emphasis on \"big-name\" speakers capable of filling Shriver Hall<br />\nbut who failed to contribute to the program topic.<br />\n\"The speakers are attractive enough to draw large audiences,\" he<br />\nstated, \"but the purpose is not entertainment at the expense of<br />\neducation. Those in attendance will really benefit from each segment.<br />\nWe consider ourselves lucky to get this list of speakers who are both<br />\naudience-drawers and most authoratative in their fields.\"<br />\n\"The speakers are cumulative,\" he continued. \"The audience will<br />\namek the conclusion at the end.\" A special session will be held<br />\nNovember 3, following Jim Bouton's presentation, to sum up and<br />\nevulate the series.<br />\n<br />\nMore<br />\n<br />\nMSE Symposium<br />\nschedule of speakers<br />\nOctober 6,4:00 pm.

Another part of the law<br />\nwhich irritates state medical<br />\nschools is that state residency<br />\nrequirements can not be used to<br />\nscreen the foreign students<br />\nassigned to a school by HEW.<br />\nAccording to Yardley, at least<br />\nthirteen schools have come out<br />\nwith a position of definite<br />\nnon-acceptance of the provision.<br />\nHe noted that the nature of the<br />\napplication procedure makes it<br />\npossible for a school to postpone<br />\nmaking a commitment to the<br />\nprovision for a long time.<br />\nHopkins avoided this course of<br />\naction for philosophical reasons.<br />\nYardley indicated that there<br />\nhas been no response as yet from<br />\nWashington concerning President<br />\nMuller's letter.

If this<br />\nSystem is successful, another may<br />\nbe purchased for use in the<br />\nEisenhower library.<br />\nAccording to studies<br />\nC onducted by Shirley Baker,<br />\nHutzler Undergraduate Librarian,<br />\nthe most frequently used books<br /><br />\nat Hutzler are the study aids, that<br />\nis, reference books and texts that<br />\n.supplement students' assigned<br />\ntexts. Formerly, these texts were<br />\navailable on a circulating basis<br />\n(except, of course, for<br />\nnon-circulating reference<br />\nmaterials) but, because of their<br />\nvalue to students, they often<br />\ndisappeared soon after their<br />\npurchase. Thus students who<br />\ncame to Hutzler seeking a<br />\nspecific and often crucial text,<br />\nsuch as Lehninger or the CRC<br />\nHandbook, could never depend<br />\nupon finding it on the shelves. It<br />\nis in the interest of serving the<br />\nentire student body, therefore,<br />\nthat this security system has been<br />\ninstituted.<br />\nThe most used portion of the<br />\nsix thousand books in the<br />\ncollection (about two-thirds)<br />\nhave been made non-circulating,<br /><br />\nThe Johns Hopkins University<br />\nSchool Of Medicine has indicated<br />\nthat it will sacrifice as much as<br />\n$700,000 next year in federal<br />\nassistance by refusing to change<br />\nits admissions policies for foreign<br />\ntransfer students.<br />\nThe school will become<br />\nineligible to receive certain<br />\nfederal grants because of its<br />\nrefusal to comply with Section<br />\n771B, Title VII, of Public Law<br />\n94-484.

The only<br />\nuniversity criteria they would<br />\nhave to meet would be entrance<br />\nrequirements, rather than<br />\nacademic requirements. As<br />\nexplained by medical school<br />\nAssistant Dean for Academic<br />\nAffairs Dr. John Yardley, this<br />\nwould mean that an applicant<br />\nwould be responsible for having<br />\ntaken organic chemistry, for<br />\nexample, but not for having<br />\nreceived an \"A\" or \"B\" mark in<br />\nthat course, or any specified<br />\ngrade point average.<br />\nIn an open letter sent to<br />\nmembers of Congress, President<br />\nSteven Muller held that the<br />\nso that they are always available<br />\nfor those who need them.

The announcement,<br />\nwhich came two days after the<br />\nUniversity of Maryland had<br />\nreceived a similar notice, has<br />\nbeen perhaps the only clear piece<br />\nof information in the unravelling<br />\nof this rather curious spy tale.<br />\nBetween November, 1958 and<br />\nAugust, 1962, CIA monies were<br />\nused to finance a study of highly<br />\n'allergic substances.\" Just what<br />\nthose substances wre, and who<br />\nWas involved in their production<br /><br />\nis unclear, and because of the<br />\nsketchy nature of the facts of the<br />\ncase, it is doubtful that they ever<br />\nwill be. Still, according to the<br />\nUniversity's general counsel,<br />\nEstelle A. Fishbein, there was no<br />\nindication that the research<br />\ninvolved human subjects.<br />\nPerhaps the principal reason<br />\nfor the enigma is that the bulk of<br />\nthe MK-ULTRA records now<br />\nextant are mostly financial<br />\nrec ords, and add only<br />\nfragmentary information on the<br />\nnature of each of the projects.<br />\nOddly enough, until these<br />\nrecords had been found, most of<br />\nthe information on MK ULTRA<br /><br />\nwas believed to have Peen<br />\ndestroyed in 1973, according to a<br />\nstatement by the agency's general<br />\ncounsel, Anthony A. Lapham.<br />\nMost of the documents<br />\nexamined by Mrs. Fishbein were<br />\nvouchers and expense forms,<br />\naveraging about four thousand<br />\ndollars a year. Fishbein noted<br />\nthat there was an \"inordinate\"<br />\namount of paperwork concerning<br />\nan $18.26 discrepancy.<br />\nAs for the nature of the<br />\nresearch itself, less is clear.

Yardley<br />\nnoted that the provision in<br />\nquestion was added at the last<br />\nmoment by a Senate-House<br />\nconference committee, and that<br />\nit was overlooked in debate on<br />\nthe measure. The University<br />\nhopes that bringing the matter to<br />\nthe attention of Congress may<br />\ninduce them to act upon it.<br />\nAn amendment to the<br />\nprovision has already been<br />\nintroduced into Congress. This<br />\nmeasure would limit the number<br />\nof HEW selected transfer<br />\nstudents to five percent of the<br />\nclass, or ten students, whichever<br />\nis greater. In Hopkins' case, ten<br />\nsuch students would have to be<br />\naccepted each year. Yardley<br />\nstated that such a figure is still<br />\ntoo high to be acceptable.<br />\nIn the event that Hopkins loses<br />\nits capitation grant funds, Muller<br />\nemphasized that the budget at<br />\nthe medical school will be<br />\nreduced. \"The resulting financial<br />\nburden will not be placed on the<br />\nmedical students of the<br />\nuniversity,\" the letter states.<br />\n\u2022 Tuition will be increased at the<br />\nmedical school next year,<br />\nhowever, due to other factors.<br />\nSEE TUITION PAGE 13<br /><br />\nAMR..<br /><br />\n\u2022Marshall McLuhan<br /><br />\nDavid Feldman<br /><br />\nSymposium opens Oct. 6th<br />\n\"Television and Society: the World in 21\" (Diagonally)\"<br />\nthis year's topic for the Milton S.

An integral part of<br />\nBaltimore's intellectual life, the Symposium's lectures often attract as<br />\nmany community residents as students.<br />\nUnfortunately, not all of the topics succeed, and last years' series,\"A<br />\nQuestion of Freedom,\" was less than successful.

Similarly, the<br />\nmarijuana laws have been seen by some (e.g., Garry Wills) as<br />\na means of persecuting the lower class urban dweller, while<br />\nthe upper class suburbanites are rarely bothered.<br />\nMost recently, President Carter engaged in an action<br />\nwhich discriminates not only against class but against sex.<br />\nBy restricting the use of Federal Health funding to disclude<br />\nabortions. Carter has sought to enforce a moral decision '<br />\nagainst a legalistic problem, and in ding so, has attempted'<br />\nto decide the morality of a question for others.<br />\nIn a nutshell, our position is this: If Medical aid is the<br />\nright of every individual (and, indeed, this seems to be the<br />\nGovernment's position as well; viz. Medicare, HEW, etc.),<br />\nthen anymedical operation which is legal in the United<br />\nStates should be available to all citizens. So long as the<br />\ngovernment condones abortion with legality, it is clarly<br />\ndiscriminatory to deny it to those unable to afford it.<br />\nThe issue here is not whether abortion is moral. The<br />\nRight to Life movement should direct their energies to the<br />\nrepeal of the abortion laws, not the repeal of Federal<br />\nfunding. President Carter should realize that morality<br />\ncannot be legislated, either through direct or indirect<br />\nmeans.<br /><br />\nEmployment<br /><br />\nFeatures Editors<br />\nMike Deak<br />\nMike Giuliano<br /><br />\nBusiness Staff<br />\nMark 1Polkow<br />\nElliot Grover<br /><br />\nSports Editor<br />\nAndrew Cohen<br /><br />\nNews Editor<br />\nRobert Riggs<br /><br />\nPhotography<br />\nJennifer Bishop<br /><br />\nManaging Editor<br />\nDavid Hawk<br />\nProduction<br />\nRhona Lyons<br />\n\"Mystery\"<br />\n.

In that age,<br />\ninquisitions and religious wars were, in the first<br />\nplace, political perversions of an existential<br />\nstandpoint created by a man who frustrated the<br />\nhopes of his contemporaries by insisting that His.<br />\nkingdom was not of this world; and, in any event,<br />\nmodernity can make no claims to comparative<br />\ninnocence. Our age of rationalism, of \"scientific\"<br />\nideology, is curiously simultaneous with terrorism,<br />\ntotalitarianism, and destructive revolution on an<br />\nunprecedented scale. Science has so completely<br />\nfailed to substantiate anyone's humanistic optimism<br />\nthat its apotheosis is now virtually unheard of. This<br />\ndevelopment has to do not only with the fact that<br />\nscience is the matrix of destructive capacity as well<br />\nas constructive capacity, but with the fact that<br />\n\"scientific\" analysis brooks no distinctively religious<br />\nproblems as such in human subjectivity. Rather, it<br />\nattempts to analyze these \"prima facie\" religious<br />\nproblems into something else, reducing them, in<br />\nnot<br />\neffect, to something that they are<br />\nradical empiricism;<br />\nexperienced as. This is not<br />\nit is, rather the ideologizing of man,and it does not<br />\nwork.<br />\nIt is the death of man. The modern secular<br />\npsychological project, beginning most dramatically<br />\nwith psychoanalysis in the late nineteenth century,<br />\nrooted itself in the rejection of the inexplicable face<br />\nof experience in a search for its mechanistic guts.<br />\nThis was a rejection of the radically experiential<br />\nmethod of defining man for ideological ways of<br />\ndoing so. The point is that man experiences<br />\nfreedom, guilt, responsibility, transcendence, and,<br />\ntraditionally in the West, these were viewed not as<br />\nillusions, but rather as the foundational realities of<br />\nMan. With the advent of modern scientific analysis<br />\nwe adopted the assumption that we are simply<br />\nfooled into believing these things about ourselves;<br />\nthe methodological assumption of a hopefully<br />\ncomprehensive science was that everything had a<br />\ncause. Thus we ended up explaining ourselves in<br />\nterms of an ideological determinism which we could<br />\nnot observe and rejecting the freedom, guilt,<br />\nresponsibility, and transcendence which we could<br />\nobserve.<br />\nNow I certainly think that there is something<br />\ndefinitely specious about this, especially insofar as<br />\nwe are the ones who come up with the ideology. It<br />\nis not that I reject the causal foundations of natural<br />\nscience, but rather that I reject this foundation as a<br />\ncomprehensive view of things. It seems odd to apply<br />\nit to a consciousness which objectifies the causal<br />\nnexus and seems always in a position to break it<br />\nonce it is known. Sartre, of course, would agree.<br />\nMan, from a radically experiential standpoint, is<br />\nfreedom.<br />\nBut it is not this rather abstruse philosophical<br />\ninsight which has broken down psychoanalysis in<br />\nless than one hundred years; rather, I am inclined to<br />\nbelieve it is the latter's comparative therapeutic<br />\nfailure. Today the psychiatrist often deals in<br />\n\"reality therapy,\" or \"logo-therapy,\" in which the<br />\nface of subjective experience is accepted and the<br />\npatient is expected to own up to freedom,<br />\nresponsibility, and the necessity of decisions leading<br />\nto meaning:We live in an era in which a Carl Becker<br />\nunderstands all human behavior as an existential<br />\nstrategy for escaping death, death as subjective<br />\nnothingness, meaninglessness, valuelessness, and<br />\nlovelessness. All of which goes to say that we are<br />\nturning back to ourselves instead of paying homage<br />\nto \"scientific\" ideology.<br />\nBut this revolution 114s.only just begun and the<br />\naverage modern man has not even begun to digest its<br /><br />\nTwo days ago, as a part of Full Employment Week, the<br />\nInterdenominational Minesterial Alliance and the<br />\nAFL-CIO staged rallies at City Hall and Center Plaza in an<br />\nattempt to call public attention to the current high rate of<br />\nunemployment, particularly among blacks. More than<br />\nTwenty Baltimore ministers, among them Chaplain<br />\nChester Wickwire, presented a staement which accused<br />\nour national leaders of \"committing themselves to the<br />\nproposition of maintaining high rates of unemployment to<br />\noffset the rising price levels attendant to inflation.\" Such<br />\na policy, of course, shows a crass disregard for the lives of<br />\nthose unemployed. Particularly hard hit is the Black<br />\ncommunity, where the unemployment rate is around 14%.<br />\nThe percentage of unemployed black adolescents averages<br />\n35% and is as high as 70% . In fact, Baltimore ranks<br />\nsecond to Detroit in its rate of unemployment among<br />\nblack teenagers. The IMA is asking that ;ndividuals write<br />\nletters to President Carter and to Representative Parren<br />\nMitchell expressing their concern. Among other things,<br />\nthey hope that the office of Revenue Sharing will<br />\ninvestigate the use of federal funds in our city and state to<br />\nevaluate their availability and use for the needy.<br />\nDr. Wickwire stressed that \"we shouldn't be dealing with<br />\neconomic problems in terms of inflation, but dealing with<br />\nthem in terms of people.\" He went on to criticize the lack<br />\nof social concern at Hopkins. \"How far removed we are<br />\non campus from what's going on down in the city. We're<br />\nso isolated from what's going on on the other side of<br />\nNorth Avenue.\" This coming Sunday, ministers<br />\nthroughout the city will ask their congregations to write<br />\nthe President. On campus, Dr. Wickwire hopes that within<br />\nthe next few days individuals will write letters to Carter<br />\nand then drop them off at the office of the Chaplain,<br />\nwhere, sometime early next week, the hopefully large<br />\n.<br />\n.<br />\nrarliral inpvitabilitipc (1nrp mnriprn mnn<br />\ntho<br />\nstack of mail will be given to the Postal Service. We<br />\nurgeChaPlain will find that the sort of public program<br />\nA students and faculty members to add to the stack.<br />\nthat he seems to presently promote is hopelessly<br />\nY kJ<br /><br />\nnon-religious and therefore uninteresting to religious<br />\npeople as such. The aesthetic surface of a chaplain's<br />\nprogram which is constituted out of religion<br />\ncourses, ostensibly stuffy seminars about<br />\n\"individual and societal growth\" or \"issues in health<br />\ncare delivery,\" and volunteer work which could as<br />\nwell be provided by an Office of Mundane<br />\nrecherche \"relevance.\" But it is also the reduction<br />\nof religion to good anthropology, good ethics, good<br />\npolitics, and good humanism; and as good as it all is,<br />\nit is merely paltry when placed beside Christ's<br />\nradical denial of subjective death - this being the<br />\nmost sublime religious issue in life.<br />\nThere is no morally authentic humanism in a man<br />\n(there is no strength for it) until he has solved the<br />\nirreducibly and distinctively religious problem of<br />\nlife as a personal abyss in which there is the failure<br />\nto instantiate value, radical contingency, a dearth of<br />\nhope and love, and an abiding despair that he can<br />\nonly run from. The Chaplain's public program<br />\nseems, in the face of this, religiously irrelevant another manifestation of the impoverished modern<br />\nemphasis: the relation of ideology to man and man<br />\nto man rather than, firstly, the relation of man to<br />\nhis own subjectivity and consequently to God. It<br />\nexcludes the religiously fundamental search for a<br />\nhealthy subjective authenticity. Thus the Chaplain<br />\nseems to offer us one more moment in the silence of<br />\nGod, unless a course on \"individual growth\" is more<br />\nthan ideological.<br />\nHegel pointed out that the dialectical product of<br />\nGod's death is not the promotion of man, but,<br />\nrather, the deification of Death itself. But the<br />\nscientific age has only \"killed\" God as a necessary<br />\naspect of limited scientific explanations as such and<br />\ncannot, even in principle, \"kill\" him as a moral<br />\nn.ecesity,. not an ultimate explanation. Still, even if<br />\nthe \"death of God\" cannot be produced<br />\nscientifically and is actually identical with ignorance<br />\nof God,the practical effect is not that man becomes<br />\nGod but, once again, that Death becomes God. The<br />\nuniverse not only remains ultimately inexplicable to<br />\nman, but his history becomes a reign of terror. One<br />\nhundred years ago Zarathustra came out of the hills<br />\nto announce the death of God (albeit, too early);<br />\nOrwell and Huxley, in their more recent<br />\npronouncement were much more modest: they<br />\nmerely descried the death of Man (albeit, too late).<br />\nThe seemingly manufactured \"relevance\" of<br />\ncontemporary \"religion\" is no resurrection,for it<br />\ndoes not return us to the face of human subjectivity<br />\n(nor consequently to the face of God.)<br />\nStill, this exact moment of the age remains<br />\nuncertain, not clearly a decision to remain with<br />\nDeath, palling of its own tawdriness. It has squeezed<br />\nthe magnitude out of everything, including sex,<br />\nmarriage, and childbearing. In doing so it waters an<br />\nalready rooted existential rebellion in human nature<br />\nwhich cannot long bear the total absence of the<br />\ngoodness accruing frOm the fulfillment of moral<br />\nduty. The contemporary man's and woman's<br />\ntotalitarian and loveless behavior toward their own<br />\nunborn children is perhaps the most repulsive and<br />\nextreme selfishness teleologically implied by the<br />\ndeath of all moral authority - the death of God. The<br />\nugliness, the hollowness, the simple moral<br />\nbankruptcy of the West is now unendurable. What<br />\nwe shall probably have to protect ourselves against<br />\nin the next tens to twenty years is the fascist<br />\npotential in the inevitable human reaction to it. We<br />\nwill have to insure that the form this reaction takes<br />\nis not politically or religiously authoritarian, but a<br />\nmatter of religious grace. In this sense, Christ is the<br />\nmodel for authority. Nevertheless, this is not a<br />\nmodel of innocuous piety, for Christ the tiger (as<br />\nEliot put it) subjectively radicalizes men and women<br />\nin the face of Death.<br />\n--Thomas A.

Thus<br />\nno real growth in the collection<br />\ncould be achieved. With the new<br />\nsecurity plan and a sizeable grant<br />\nfor new purchases in the offing,<br />\nthe Hutzler collection will<br />\nimprove in both size and quality.<br />\nMs. Baker has concentrated much<br />\neffort into weeding out less<br />\nneeded books in order to make<br />\nroom for volumes in greater<br />\ndemand.<br />\nThe library paid eighteen<br />\nhundred dollars for the detection<br />\ndevice this year, and will<br />\ncontinue to make smaller<br />\npayments on it for the next four<br />\nyears. After the first five years, a<br />\ntwo hundred dollar service charge<br />\nmust be paid each year. When a<br />\nsensitized book is detected by<br />\nthe machine, an alarm, much like<br /><br />\nthat sounded at the Eisenhower<br />\nlibrary before closing, is<br />\nactivated, and the exit gate locks<br />\nso the person cannot leave. The<br />\nstudent will be asked to search<br />\nhis belongings to determine if he<br />\nhas accidentally included a<br />\nHutzler book. It is understood<br />\nand expected that a number of<br />\nindividuals will leave with books<br />\nunintentionally, merely<br />\nforgetting that they belong to the<br />\nlibrary.<br />\nSince the reading room is open<br />\ntwenty four hours, no<br />\ninconvenience should result from<br />\nthe decision to put these books<br />\non non -circulating status. As<br />\nmost students can attest, there is<br />\nnothing more frustrating than<br />\nrunning over to Hutzler at four<br />\no'clock in the morning to cram<br />\nfor a test or finish a paper and<br />\nfind that the book you've been<br />\nusing has disappeared. Now, with<br />\nan effective security system and a<br />\nlittle student cooperation, these<br />\nbooks can remain in the library,<br /><br />\nweile, Old<br /><br />\n4 / News-Letter, Vol. 82, no. 2<br /><br />\nFilm Series<br /><br />\nBaltimore Audiences Have Choice<br />\nBY MIKE GIULIANO<br />\nThe Office of the Chaplain's Reel World, now in its<br />\nfifth year, is the biggest film series in Baltimore,<br />\npresentirig more than sixty films (roughly half<br />\nHollywood, half foreign) on Wednesday and Sunday<br />\nevenings at 7:30 p.m. All screenings are on the<br />\nHomewood campus and most are in Shriver Hall. Because<br />\nthe Reel World is well-established and reasonably wellpublicized it attracts an audience from most sections of<br />\nthe city (and even a few determined film buffs from<br />\nColumbia.)<br />\nAccording to a Reel World organizer, more residents of<br />\nthe Charles Village - Mount Vernon area than Hopkins'<br />\nstudents hold Reel World subscriptions. Particularly<br />\nunfortunate, if not surprising, is the Tact that \"very few<br />\nundergraduates take part.\" As a part of this year's<br />\nfreshman orientation program and, perhaps, also in an<br />\neffort to encourage undergraduate participation in the<br />\nseries, freshmen were admitted free to this year's opening<br />\nfilm, Charles Chaplin's Modern Times. Around one<br />\nhundred fifty freshmen took advantage of this free<br />\nadmission, and the total attendance was an encouraging<br />\nfour hundred thirty. (A Reel World presentation usually<br />\ndraws around one hundred people.)<br />\nSeries admissions are by subscription only. There are<br />\nvarious plans: sixty admissions for thirty five dollars,<br />\nthirty for twenty two dollars, twelve for ten dollars, six<br />\nfor six dollars, and four for five dollars. The next Reel<br />\nWorld presentation is Jan Kadar's Shop On Main Street, a<br />\nCzech film that has enjoyed international acclaim since its<br />\nshowing at the Czechoslovak Film Week in London in<br />\n1965; it will be shown this Sunday, September 11.<br />\nAnother Czech film, Ivan Passer's Intimate Lighting<br />\n(1967), will follow on September 14. For further<br />\ninformation call the Office of the Chaplain at 338-8187.<br />\nAnother film series, the one at the Hopkins Graduate<br />\nClub (basement of McCoy Hall), will run on Thursday<br />\nevenings at eight p.m. Unlike previous films at the Grad<br />\nClub, there will be a one dollar admission charge for this<br />\nseries, which opens on September 15 with Sidney Lumet's<br />\nLong Day's Journey Into Night.<br />\nCenter Stage (700 N.

The price of admission<br /><br />\nis $2 for adults ($3.50 for a double feature) and one<br />\ndollar for children. Because show times often vary from<br />\nweekend to the next it's advisable to call the Center Stage<br />\nbox office at 332-0033.<br />\nThe Baltimore Film Forum also screens its films at<br />\nCenter Stage. Their programs begin at eight p.m. on<br />\nMondays. The tentative schedule is as follows: Greta<br />\nGarbo in Painted Veil on September 19; Rene Clair's The<br />\nLast- Millionaire on October 17; Claude Chabrol's Les<br />\nBiches on November 21; Werner Herzog's Even Dwarfs<br />\nStarted Small and Fata Morgana on December 19;<br />\nRouben Mamoulian's Applause on January 23; Alain<br />\nResnais' La Guerre Est Finie on February 27; Agnes<br />\nVarda's Les Creatures on March 13; and Yasujiro Ozu's<br />\nAn Autumn Afternoon on May 15.

Allan Felix, a 29-year old film critic, suddenly finds himself single when his wife leaves to pursue a life of adventure.<br />\nonely and depressed, Allan turns to his friends Linda and Dick Christie for comfort.

These scenes are cleverly<br />\n,identified by special lighting effects and the use of the side balconies. Cliff Braverman stars as Allan Felix. Rick Vaum and<br />\n'Lisa Lystad play Allan's friends, Dick and Linda. Marc Nasdoi- shaved off his beara to play Humphrey Bogart.

It was the new band, big and<br />\nelectric, with several odd instruments, a number of young<br />\nwhites, and a formidable stack of amplifiers. In the midst<br />\nof it all, among such stars as Gary Bartz, Keith Jarrett,<br />\nand John McLaughlin, was an odd, bearded Brasillian,<br />\nwith a rather large variety of noisemakers. He would<br />\nshake them, scrape them, and do what seemed to be just<br />\nany old thing, always adding an interesting texture, but<br />\nno discernable pulse.<br />\nSometime later, a record appeared, put together by<br />\nsome of Miles old musicians. Joe Zawinul and Wayne<br />\nShorter had formed an electric, impressionist quintet<br />\ncalled Weather Report, and there in the rhythm section<br />\nwas this same Brasillian. His name was Airto Moriea, and<br />\nthis time around, he added as much color as rhythm ,<br />\nnicely rounding Al Mouzon's drumming.<br />\nStill later, Chick Corea came out with an album called<br />\nReturn To Forever. Produced by Manfred Eicher for his<br />\nECM lable, the album was quite a change from Corea's<br />\nprevious group, an exploratory hard bop ensemble<br />\nfeaturing Anthony Braxton. Along with his newly-found<br />\nleft hand, Stanley Clarke, there was Airto, this time with<br />\nhis wife, Flora Purim.<br />\nAirto and Flora were the beginning of an invasion of<br />\nwave\" Brasillian jazz, an invasion that has yet to<br />\nreach its peak. Unlike the previous Brasillian intrusions<br />\n(Samba, Bossa Nova, etc), this new wave maintains much<br />\nof its native flavor, while keeping its strictly jazz sense. It<br />\nuses a complex, contagious beat, laced under a delicate<br />\nsense of harmony and an almost Rhapsodic sense of<br />\nmelody.<br />\nAt the vanguard right now, is Milton Nascimento.<br />\nMilton is this generation's Jobim, but unlike Jobim, he<br />\ncan sing his own songs with nonpareil grace and finesse.<br />\nHe has only one album in print over here, but he has<br />\nappeared on Wayne Shorter's Native Dancer, Flora<br />\nPurim's 500 Miles High, and Airto's Promises ofthe Sun.<br /><br />\nnew<br />\n\"<br /><br />\nmodal line, easily on par with the most sohpisticated Cole<br />\nPorter melody.<br />\nMilton has nearly eighteen albums out in Brazil(or so<br />\nit has been rumored); if you can't get Geraes, anything<br />\nelse will do. Milton, like cocaine, is an acquired taste, but<br />\none that can easily become insatiable.<br />\nOn the other end of the spectrum is Hermeto<br />\nPascoal.Hermeto, unlike Milton, is more of a performer<br />\nthan a composer. Although he is a prolific writer, he is an<br />\neven more amazing soloist, able to play piano, flute,<br />\nsoprano, and guitar with equal fluidity. He has recorded<br />\nwith Miles Davis, Airto and Flora, and.Flora lists him as<br />\nher principal influence.<br />\nA disappointment, then that his only extant American<br />\nalbum is such a failure. Unfortunately, what in many<br />\nplayers would be strengths become weaknesses under the<br />\nHermeto's ability. He plays too well, and too much, the<br />\nbeing a musical offering which is almost<br />\nresult<br />\nPascoal<br />\nflute solo, Hermeto<br />\nindigestable. Some things, like Airto's prepared hog<br />\nsqueals on Missa dos Escravos or Hermeto's rambling<br />\nFurther, he wrote Turrentine's hit, \"Salt Song...\"<br />\npiano on Escuta Meu Piano, are sheer brilliance;<br />\nUnfortunately Milton's American dates have not been regrettably, the rest of the album degenerates into<br />\nas exceptional as his Brasillian sessions. For example, poinless albeit virtuosic, noodling.<br />\narc\u00b0 Marimbondo on Airto's Promises album seems<br />\nalmost leaden in comparison with Milton's Geraes album.<br />\nLikewise, Cade, which appears on a single inside<br />\nMilagre dos Peixes looses its sense of loosness when it is<br />\ntransformed into \"Fairy Tale Song.\"<br />\nNone the less, his American album is still a classic, with<br />\nAirto's brilliant percussion work off-setting Herbie<br />\non Cravo e Catzele or<br />\nHancock's sprightly piano<br />\nMilton's solitary beauty on Chamada.<br />\nThose interested in his imports should look into<br />\nGeraes. Although it is not too available locally, it can be<br />\nobtained in New York. With some of Milton's best<br />\nmaterial to date as well as surprisingly good production, it<br />\nis well worth the trip. Some of the tunes, like Prom essas<br />\ndo Sol, carry a primitive, ritualistic intensity, which is<br />\nnicely builty around folk guitars and wooden flutes.<br />\nOthers, like Nelson Angelo's Fazenda, carry a complex,<br /><br />\nMontezuma's Revenge<br />\nThey've played for crowds of<br />\nupwards of fifteen thousand<br />\npeople to standing ovations.<br />\nThey've worked with acts like<br />\nLoggins and Messina, Neil<br />\nSedaka, The Band, Judy Collins,<br />\nBette Midler and David Bromberg<br />\n-- delighting all these audiences.<br />\nIn small halls and large arenas all<br />\nacross the country Aztec<br />\nTwo-Step have generated a<br />\nwarmth and intensity that few<br />\nperformers can match. Now Rex<br />\nFowler and Neal Shulman Aztec Two-Step, have brought<br />\ntheir magic to Hopkins. With<br /><br />\ntheir concert tonight at nine<br />\no'clock, they should give<br />\nHopkins the same electric<br />\nperformance they have become<br />\nknown for nationwide.<br />\nFor the past few years, Rex<br />\nFowler and Neal Shulman, Aztec<br />\nTwo-Step, have been weaving a<br />\nunique patchwork of folk, rock<br />\nand country. Wherever they<br />\nperform, their loyal, fanatical<br />\nand always vocal fans come out<br />\nto support them. They have<br />\ncreated something of a legend<br />\nabout themselves. There was that<br />\nunforgettable weekend gig at The<br /><br />\nUnicorn in Ithaca, New York<br />\nwhere Neal and Rex set the house<br />\nattendance record. And there was<br />\nthe time they attracted fourteen<br />\nhundred devotees to the<br />\nUniversity of Rhode Island where<br />\npeople climbed through windows<br />\ntwelve feet off the ground and<br />\nliterally sat on the rafters to hear<br />\n\"Baking,\" \"Dean Moriarty\" and<br />\n\"Humpty Dumpty.\"<br />\nAztec Two-Step has been in<br />\nexistence since the summer of<br />\n1971.

Instead of handling the scoring<br />\nteam as he has in years past, Cox will turn those duties<br />\nover to assistant coach Willie Scroggs. The headcoach will<br />\nrun the defense.<br />\n\"We plan to employ a wide open offense similar to that<br />\nemployed by the University of Houston,\" explained Cox.<br />\n\"This year our fans will see a lot of option plays; passing,<br />\npitching out to the running backs, and extensive running<br />\nby the quarterback.\"<br />\nThis year's starting quarterback will be Tom Bender, a<br />\njunior from Rosedale, Maryland. It will be Bender's third<br />\nseason as the Blue Jay signal caller and Cox is expecting<br />\nbig things from this veteran. Just behind Bender stand<br />\nsenior Bob DeSimone of Plainview, New York and<br />\nsophomore Joel Hansen from Chantilly, Virginia.<br />\nThe tailback positions are aptly filled. by Ken Bess, a<br />\nsenior from Laurel, and a strong frosh candidate, Bernie<br />\nCook of Cockesville. Baltimore boy John Railey, Kevin<br />\nKeefer of Westminster, and Tom Meurer, also from<br />\nBaltimore, will take the fullback spots. Wide receivers<br />\nDave Campbell of Pikesville and Joe Devlin of Annapolis<br />\ncombined with tight-end Steve Wey of Baltimore should<br />\nstrength-en the Jay passing attack.<br />\nThe offensive line is chock full of experience with its<br />\nlist of returning lettermen: Bob Divers, Rick Law, Rick<br />\nBroadhurst, and Chuck Kennedy. A battle does exist for<br />\nthe remaining spot between freshmen Jim Hood of<br /><br />\nBaltimore and Ron Chesek of Dundalk, Maryland.<br />\nLooking at Defense, the guard positions seem to have<br />\nbeen secured by lettermen Ned Sacha of Baltimore and<br />\nChuck Hauck of Owings Mills, Maryland. Letterman Dave<br />\nBudzik will handle the left tackle duties while frosh Cook<br />\nand Hood battle it out for the right tackle post. Doober<br />\nAburn of Towson and Him Schoettler of Chevy Chase will<br />\nbe at the defensive end spots.<br />\nan interesting<br />\nIn the linebacker category, Cox sees<br />\nbattle developing over the two starting positions. Junior<br />\nletterman Sonny Mills, Divers, Meurer, and Keefer should<br />\nall be playing in those spots this season. John Scully of<br />\nElicott City, Maryland will take the defensive halfback<br />\npost.<br />\nThis season Cox has also expanded his kicking game,<br />\nemploying Steve Love, a junior from Thurmount,<br /><br />\nMarybrid, to boot field goals and kickoffs. The punting<br />\nteam will consist of Tom Meurer and John Railey. Cox is<br />\nhoping that Love's foot will add an extra scoring<br />\ndimension that he could not count on in previous year.<br />\nThe Blue Jays will scrimmage this weekend at Lebanon<br />\nValley College before opening their season the following<br />\nweek at Susquehanna University. The first home game<br />\nwill take place on Homewood Field on September 24<br />\nwhen the Jays meet Muhlenberg.<br />\nCox looks at his Middle Atlantic Conference Southern<br />\nDivision schedule as a tough one. \"Certainly, the team to<br />\nbeat is Franklin and Marshall,\" cited the head coach.<br />\n\"Widener should also offer some tough competition.\" No<br />\nmatter how tough the schedule is this year Cox fully<br />\nexpects the team to better last year's mark of 3-5-1.<br /><br />\nNEW SPORTS NAMES<br />\nelsh<br /><br />\n[B ielawski<br /><br />\nJohn Bielawski, a native of Sparrows Point and<br />\nTim Welsh will serve as the new head swim coach at<br />\ngraduate degree holder from Indiana State, was named<br />\nJohns Hopkins in 1977-1978.

Simms felt that this<br />\nwas an indication that his topic was something special. \"We were only<br />\nthe second symposium in eleven years to be selected by more than fifty<br />\npercent of the student body.\"<br />\n\"Television and Society,\" said Simms, will cover nearly all aspects of<br />\ntelevision -- the way it works in society, and the way the audience has<br />\ndetermined what will be on television. The average viewer will see that<br />\nhe does have an impact.\"<br />\n\"T.V. is changing society, but also society is changing itself,\" Simms<br />\ncontinued. \"Television is a mirror of society. It's a mirror that doesn't<br />\nreflect every detail \u2014 it's a mirror that collects and condenses the<br />\naspects of society that people seem to want to see.\"<br />\nThe concept of this year's program, according to Simms,is \"a critical<br />\nlook at television,\" and its objective is \"that those in attendance should<br />\nrealize the effect of T.V. on them. They should be aware that the<br />\nprogram they're seeing is only bordering on reality.\"<br />\nEach speaker will have a valid point to make about television, and its<br />\nissues. Previous symposia were criticized by Simms for placing too<br />\nmuch emphasis on \"big-name\" speakers capable of filling Shriver Hall<br />\nbut who failed to contribute to the program topic.<br />\n\"The speakers are attractive enough to draw large audiences,\" he<br />\nstated, \"but the purpose is not entertainment at the expense of<br />\neducation. Those in attendance will really benefit from each segment.<br />\nWe consider ourselves lucky to get this list of speakers who are both<br />\naudience-drawers and most authoratative in their fields.\"<br />\n\"The speakers are cumulative,\" he continued. \"The audience will<br />\namek the conclusion at the end.\" A special session will be held<br />\nNovember 3, following Jim Bouton's presentation, to sum up and<br />\nevulate the series.<br /><br />\nMore<br /><br />\nMSE Symposium<br />\nschedule of speakers<br />\nOctober 6,4:00 pm.

Another part of the law<br />\nwhich irritates state medical<br />\nschools is that state residency<br />\nrequirements can not be used to<br />\nscreen the foreign students<br />\nassigned to a school by HEW.<br />\nAccording to Yardley, at least<br />\nthirteen schools have come out<br />\nwith a position of definite<br />\nnon-acceptance of the provision.<br />\nHe noted that the nature of the<br />\napplication procedure makes it<br />\npossible for a school to postpone<br />\nmaking a commitment to the<br />\nprovision for a long time.<br />\nHopkins avoided this course of<br />\naction for philosophical reasons.<br />\nYardley indicated that there<br />\nhas been no response as yet from<br />\nWashington concerning President<br />\nMuller's letter.
