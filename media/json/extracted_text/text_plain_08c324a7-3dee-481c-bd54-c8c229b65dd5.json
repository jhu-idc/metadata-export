She said she<br />\nhoped that a sexual harassment<br />\nprogram could be combined<br />\nwith a program on other fraternity issues, such as alcohol<br />\npolicy and community relations. She said she was working<br />\non that before the TEP incident<br />\noccurred.<br />\nPorter said she would like to<br />\nsee the national fraternities<br />\nsend representatives to such a<br />\nforum, and that their response<br />\nhas been positive.

The complainant was<br />\nnot injured, and the total loss<br />\nwas $102.00.<br />\n*While leaving the campus<br />\nby the Wyman Park gate at<br />\n10:00 p.m. on Oct. 30, an<br />\nevening college student was<br />\naccosted by three male<br />\nsuspects. The victim was<br />\nknocked to the ground and<br />\nbeaten about the head and<br />\n<br />\nbody with a nunchakus. The<br />\nvictim's pants, underclothing<br />\nand shoes were removed.

We, as students and as citizens, are<br />\njustifiably concerned about this situation. It<br />\nseems there is little we can do, however, to<br />\nrectify the problem.<br />\nMembers of the Homewood community<br />\nshould beable to rely upon the protection<br />\nand support activities of the campus security force. Unfortunately, the services provided by this organization are often inadequate<br />\nand, when present, seem dangerously slow.<br />\nWe feel this may be attributed to a severe<br />\nsecurity manpower shortage and, in light of<br />\ncurrent events, this dilemma must be addressed immediately.<br />\nNot only do we demand that the security<br />\nforce be strengthened in order to better protect the campus, but also that its activities<br />\nbe extended to provide adequate security to<br />\nthose students living off campus. This is not<br />\nan unreasonable nor an inappropriate request. The vast majority of Hopkins students<br />\nreside off campus and the library shuttle service, while useful, is an incomplete safety<br />\n<br />\nprovision.<br />\nWe would not suggest that security officers be stationed at every corner in Charles<br />\nVillage or in Hampden. Rather, we insist<br />\nthat the University provide the means to improve the existing system. More security personnel should be hired. Regular foot and<br />\nautomobile patrols should be implemented<br />\nand students informed of their schedule. Better lighting equipment should be installed at<br />\nHomewood, especially along well-travelled<br />\npaths. Campus emergency phones and a foot<br />\nescort service originating at the library, suggested by the Student Life committee of the<br />\nStudent Council, are likewise appropriate<br />\nmeasures.<br />\nUntil the Johns Hopkins University<br />\nrecognizes that a safety deficit exists and<br />\nbegins to take effective action, we urge all<br />\nstudents to exercise caution, especially in the<br />\nevening. Avoid taking chances which might<br />\nendanger your well-being, such as walking<br />\nhome alone at 2:00 a.m. from the Hut or a<br />\nweekend party. Be aware that you are living in a city which has one of the highest per<br />\ncapita crime rates in the country.<br />\n<br />\nLetters<br />\n\"Strong Intuitive Sense\"<br />\nTo the Editor:<br />\nI am responding to an article<br />\nby Stephen Pimentel in the<br />\nNov. 2 Newsletter, concerning<br />\n\"Freedom of Thought at<br />\nPimentel<br />\nMr.<br />\nJHU.\"<br />\ncharacterizes the Women's<br />\nCenter's proposals concerning grievance procedures as<br />\n\"perfectly sound\" but \"not the<br />\nreal issue.\" He then urges us to<br />\nconsider proper responses to<br />\n\"admittedly obnoxious\" atbehavior.<br />\nand<br />\ntitudes<br />\nSomething interesting happens<br />\nto Mr. Pimentel's argument:<br />\nin the second paragraph, the<br />\nquality of being \"obnoxious,\"<br />\n\"offensive,\" and \"objectionable\" migrates from \"attitudes and behavior\" to<br />\n\"responses.\" Does Mr. Pimentel wish to contrast the<br />\n\"sound\" response of the<br />\nFeminist Alliance with the other<br />\nirrational,<br />\n\"hysterical,\"<br />\n\"thoroughly authoritarian\"<br />\nresponses he cites? Not so fast:<br />\nthe Alliance has not, after all,<br />\nresponded properly. The connection they perceive between<br />\nactions and attitudes \"makes<br />\nexplicit what they really want to<br />\ncontrol: people's thoughts and<br />\nactions\" (p.10).<br />\nNow I object not only to the<br />\ncircular appearance of this<br />\nargument, but to its premises.<br />\nI take it that Mr. Pimentel's<br />\nfinal identification of the<br />\nAlliance's aims with those of<br />\nOrwell's Big Brother rests on<br />\nsomething less slippery than a<br />\n<br />\n\"strong intuitive sense\"\u2014<br />\nnamely, disagreement with the<br />\npremise that attitudes and actions are in some broad sense<br />\nrelated. While no one would<br />\nassert their total conformity, if<br />\nMr. Pimentel denies them any<br />\ncausal connection he requires<br />\nmore powerful artillery than a<br />\n\"strong intuitive sense.\"<br />\nThis \"strong intuitive sense\"<br />\nseems to have led Mr. Pimentel into two not insubstantial<br />\nmisunderstandings (p. 10). A<br />\ngentleman who persists in<br />\nmonopolizing a discussion<br />\namong over a hundred people,<br />\nwho fails to respect the<br />\nmoderator, lays himself open to<br />\nless official guidance: \"shut<br />\nup.\" Regrettable perhaps...<br />\nbut so is filibustering. Mr.<br />\nPimentel's implausible suggestion that an architect of the<br />\nstanding grievance procedure<br />\nfor sexual harassment invited<br />\nJennifer Kidd to \"get raped\" is<br />\nincorrect. Ms. Kidd's position:<br />\n\"I think I am no victim, ergo<br />\nno one can make me one.\"<br />\nWould this were so\u2014but acting<br />\non such beliefs may leave us<br />\nmore than merely mistaken; it<br />\nshould not be improper to point<br />\nthis out.<br />\nMr. Pimentel argues the impropriety of \"policing\" imagination and fiction. Alas! Is<br />\na member of the Alliance standing at the door of every<br />\nbrother's id in top boots with a<br />\nwhip? But enough rhetoric. No<br />\none has the ability to intervene<br />\nwith, to alter, to halt your<br />\nthoughts, Mr. Pimentel,<br />\nunless you so choose.

Last Wednesday night, I<br />\nreturned from a Halloween party in Georgetown at 3:30 a.m.<br />\nThere were no parking spaces<br />\nnear my apartment, so I had to<br />\npark in Homewood Garage,<br />\n<br />\ntwo blocks away. Not bad at 3<br />\np.m., but not a pleasing<br />\nthought at 3 a.m.!! So I figured<br />\nI'd drive on to campus, find a<br />\nsecurity officer, and ask him to<br />\nescort me the two blocks (not<br />\nan unreasonable request with<br />\nall the assaults lately). But, to<br />\nmy surprise, there were no<br />\nsecurity officers to be found. I<br />\ndrove around both ends of<br />\ncampus looking everywhere for<br />\n15 minutes, and I couldn't find<br />\na trace of a security officer. No<br />\ncars. Nothing. Campus was<br />\ndead, sure, but security should<br />\nalways be available. Nice in<br />\ntheory, but in practice I had to<br />\nwalk home alone from the<br />\nGarage (which, by the way, is<br />\npoorly lit outside because the<br />\nmain light has been out for over<br />\na month).<br />\nSecurity at Hopkins needs to<br />\nbe seriously re-evaluated and<br />\nimproved upon. The Student<br />\nServices Committee is in the<br />\nprocess of getting security<br />\nphones installed around campus and that's great. But we still<br />\nneed more. Security officers in<br />\npatrol cars (with the windows<br />\nopen) should be stationed on<br />\neach road into campus at night.<br />\nIf someone needs a security officer, they'll know where to<br />\nfind one.<br />\nSharon Sirota<br />\nClass of 1985<br />\n<br />\nNo Taxonomy<br />\nTo the Editor:<br />\nYour columnist, Stephen<br />\nPimentel, is certainly correct in<br />\nparaphrasing my letter as<br />\n\"TEP Newsletter\u2014Ugh!!\" except that \"Ugh!!\" is insufficiently harsh. Perhaps \"Expletive deleted!!!!\" would have<br />\nbeen better. My letter was written, typed, and mailed within<br />\none hour of my reading the<br />\n\"TEP Newsletter\" and was only meant to show the outrage of<br />\none male faculty member.<br />\nI find it sad that only one other<br />\nletter from a male in support of<br />\nthe position of the Feminist<br />\nAlliance has been published. I<br />\nfind it depressing that several<br />\n<br />\nwomen have come to the<br />\ndefense of TEP. But this<br />\nresponse from the student body<br />\ndoes explain why the author of<br />\nthe \"TEP Newsletter\" and the<br />\nfraternity apologized for the<br />\nwrong offenses. The attitudes<br />\nwhich surfaced in the \"TEP<br />\nNewsletter\" are much more<br />\nwidespread than I would have<br />\nexpected in a group of highly<br />\nintelligent young people. I<br />\nwould have expected their<br />\ngeneration to instruct mine<br />\nabout these matters.<br />\nLet me make explicit the<br />\nreasons I objected so strenuously to the \"TEP Newsletter.\" It<br />\nwas not the sexual content<br />\nwhich offended me. It was the<br />\nway in which the violent<br />\ndegradation of human beings<br />\nwas considered to be an appropriate topic for jest.<br />\nThroughout history, one of<br />\nthe ways in which society has<br />\nkept groups in an inferior position has been to brutalize them<br />\nby using language to imply that<br />\ntheir status is comparable to<br />\nthat of lower animals and to<br />\ntreat physical violence against<br />\nthem as humorous. It is only<br />\nwhen polite society is sufficiently inured to the acceptability of<br />\nless than human status for a<br />\ngroup that the group can be<br />\nmaintained in its inferior role.<br />\nAfter all, the\".tuck-up\" ones<br />\nwill have to be slapped down<br />\nfrom time to time in ways that<br />\nwould be wrong if applied to<br />\nequals. Certainly members of<br />\nthe polite society will not be involved in the lynchings of \"uppity niggers,\"the firebombings<br />\nof \"kike\" stores, or the raping<br />\nof \"stuck-up broads.\" We<br />\nleave these acts to others, but<br />\nsomehow we frequently do not<br />\nmete out the same punishment<br />\nto perpetrators of these acts as<br />\nwe do for -imilar offenses<br />\nagainst one of our own.

The<br />\ntheory one most often hears<br />\namong Democrats explaining<br />\nReagan's popularity is that people like Reagan's style and image and hence are willing to ignore his positions on policy<br />\nissues. This theory is sometimes<br />\nstated in more dramatic<br />\nlanguage in which Reagan is<br />\nsaid to be coated with a magical<br />\nTeflon-like substance (perhaps<br />\ncreated by a mad right-wing<br />\nscientist) which causes any<br />\ncriticism cast in his direction to<br />\nbounce away. However stated,<br />\nthe basic notion underlying this<br />\ntheory is unsupported by<br />\nevidence.<br />\nFor example, in the<br />\nNewsweek poll taken after the<br />\nfirst debate, a substantial majority (54 to 35) thought that<br />\nMondale had performed better<br />\nthan Reagan. However, when<br />\nthese same people were asked<br />\nwhich candidate better reflected<br />\ntheir views on policy issues,<br />\nReagan won by as large a<br />\nmargin (57 to 38). If there was<br />\n<br />\nany dichotomy between \"images and issues,\" it worked in<br />\nMondale's favor.<br />\nUndue preoccupation with<br />\nReagan's image has already<br />\ndone considerable mischief in<br />\nthe Democratic party and promises to do even more. Inevitably, Democratic politicians<br />\nhave begun to imitate what they<br />\nerroneously consider to be the<br />\nsources of Reagan's success,<br />\nand the resulting spectacle is<br />\nhumorous indeed. Mario<br />\nCuomo, the Governor of New<br />\nYork, provides an egregious,<br />\nthough entertaining, example<br />\nof this phenomenon. Cuomo<br />\nhabitually apes the worst<br />\naspects of Republican politics,<br />\nsputtering about \"God,\"<br />\n\"mother,\" and \"family\" at<br />\nevery opportunity. Equally uncomforting beneath the<br />\nmoralistic rhetoric, he espouses<br />\nthe same old programmatic<br />\nliberalism of the ever successful<br />\nWalter Mondale. In Mario<br />\nCuomo, we are treated to the<br />\nworst of both worlds.<br />\nIf Cuomo and other<br />\nDemocrats suppose that it is<br />\nReagan's goof-ball traditionalism which accounts for<br />\nhis popularity, they are seriously mistaken. As Mondale inout<br />\npointed<br />\ncessantly<br />\nthroughout the campaign, there<br />\n.are real policy differences bet-<br />\n<br />\nween Reagan and the<br />\nDemocrats, and it is precisely<br />\non the basis of these differences<br />\nthat Reagan has been winning.<br />\nLiberal Democrats intuitively<br />\nunderstand the implications of<br />\nthis statement, and hence spend<br />\nlarge amounts of energy attempting to deny it. Like spurned lovers, they refuse to admit<br />\nit is so, preferring instead to<br />\nconstruct dubious explanations<br />\nof their condition: Mondale's<br />\nmessage did not \"get across,\"<br />\nor the voters were unaware of<br />\nReagan's policies, or maybe<br />\nthey were blindly infatuated<br />\nwith that lump in Reagan's<br />\nhair. \"Explanations\" of this<br />\nsort were vaguely plausible<br />\nafter the 1980 election; today,<br />\nthey are simply silly. Most people know the basic thrust of<br />\nReagan's policies perfectly well<br />\nand made their decision<br />\naccordingly.<br />\nNevertheless, there is still<br />\nhope for a Democratic revival.<br />\nThe electorate has rejected not<br />\nliberalism itself, but only the<br />\nstatist variety thereof as espoused by the Democratic party in<br />\nrecent decades. Many people<br />\nhave come to view with the<br />\nphilosophy of big government<br />\nas outdated, more attuned to<br />\nthe Depression era conditions<br />\nof the 1930s than to a period of<br />\nrapid technological change.<br />\n<br />\nLetters continued<br />\nContinued from Page 8<br />\nbody, including many who plan<br />\nmedical careers, can consider<br />\nany depiction of violent<br />\ndegradation of other human beings as being humorous. It is<br />\nmore than dismaying, it is<br />\nfrightening when one considers<br />\nthe ever more complex ethical<br />\nquestions which many of them<br />\nwill have to face as further advances are made in medicine. I<br />\nthink of the group of black men<br />\nwho were used for decades to<br />\nstudy untreated syphilis in a<br />\nproject funded by the United<br />\nStates government long after an<br />\neffective cure was available.<br />\nHowever, I still believe in the<br />\nperfectability of mankind. If<br />\nthe affair of the \"TEP Newsletter\" can be used to make us all<br />\nconsider the subtle and not so<br />\nsubtle ways in which society<br />\n\"keeps women in their place,\"<br />\n<br />\nthe Women's Center has served us well by publicizing the offensive writing.<br />\nYour columnist and others<br />\nwho have written me have interpreted my letter as indicating<br />\nthat I would support thought<br />\ncontrol or censorship. I plead<br />\nnot guilty. I would oppose censorship of Penthouse, Hustler,<br />\nand Screw. It is quite another<br />\nmatter, however, to have such<br />\nwriting emanate from a group<br />\nofficially recognized by Johns<br />\nHopkins. I would, for example,<br />\noppose the publication of any<br />\nof these magazines from the<br />\nJohns Hopkins Press.<br />\nFinally, from time to time, I<br />\nhave been embarrassed by my<br />\nspecies, my sex, and my country.

However, these<br />\nbeliefs need not exclusively aid<br />\nthe Republicans.

It is difficult to see how<br />\nthe Democrats are going to be<br />\nsignificantly aided by merely<br />\nstylistic changes. What is needed is a thoroughgoing neoliberalism of a sort which places<br />\na considerably greater emphasis<br />\non individual freedom and<br />\ninitiative.<br />\nIf the prospects of the<br />\nDemocratic party are to rise, it<br />\nis crucial for Democrats to<br />\nunderstand that there is no<br />\nreturning to the status quo ante.<br />\nReagan now lays claim to a<br />\nsolid third of FDR's old coalition while holding traditional<br />\nRepublican voters firmly in<br />\nplace.

Which<br />\nbrings us to one of four points:<br />\nWhere are the security guards?<br />\nLast Monday night a student<br />\nwas told that it would take at<br />\nleast thirty minutes for a escort<br />\nbecause the operator was<br />\nunable to contact any of the<br />\nsecurity units. Two weeks ago<br />\na student waited over half an<br />\nhour for a security guard after<br />\nhaving reported being chased<br />\nby a man on campus.<br />\nWhat do the security guards<br />\ndo? On average, each shift has<br />\nfive security personnel. The<br />\nnorth end of campus is patrolled by one person in a car and<br />\none person on foot. The south<br />\nend of campus is patrolled in a<br />\nsimilar manner. The officers on<br />\nfoot are responsible for checking buildings and accessing<br />\nthem to University personnel.<br />\nThe remaining guard is responsible for inspecting off campus<br />\nUniversity housing.<br />\nThe number of security<br />\nguards working each shift is less<br />\nthan is needed to ensure the<br />\nsafety of the campus. There<br />\nshould be highly visible pairs of<br />\nguards patrolling all three<br />\nquads and the path by the Art<br />\nMuseum which is heavily frequented and has very poor<br />\n<br />\nlighting. An increase in personnel will be costly, but in questions of the safety of students,<br />\nfaculty, and staff, money<br />\nshould not be the prime<br />\nconsideration.<br />\nBecause Hopkins is not a<br />\nresidential campus, there is a<br />\nneed to be aware of what is<br />\nhappening in the surrounding<br />\narea. More than half of the student body lives off campus in<br />\nprivately owned and University owned housing. Last week,<br />\na brutal assault occurred in a<br />\nprivately-owned apartment<br />\nbuilding in Charles Village.<br />\nWith the present state of security in University-owned housing,<br />\nthe perpetrator could have easily entered the dorms or any<br />\nUniversity-owned<br />\nother<br />\nresidential hall. At a forum on<br />\nCampus Security, Major<br />\nLarkin, Security Manager, read<br />\nsome Charles Village crime<br />\nstatistics. The area where the<br />\nmost sexual assualts occur is<br />\nCalvert and 29th streets. The<br />\nUniversity has a responsibility<br />\nto 1) make all University<br />\nresidential halls more secure<br />\nand 2) continually stress to<br />\nstudents the need to heed all<br />\nsecurity precautions on and off<br />\ncampus. The students should<br />\ntake an active role in their safety by keeping informed of and<br />\nusing all security mesures. Using the intercom system in<br />\nWolman and McCoy may be an<br />\ninconvenience, but it is one<br />\nmeasure that already exists and<br />\nshould be used. Leaving the<br />\ndoors propped open is an invitation for trouble.<br />\nThe Baltimore Sun just<br />\npublished statistics showing<br />\nthat the city of Baltimore has<br />\n\u2022 the third highest rate of crime<br />\nper capita in the country.<br />\nHopkins is an urban campus<br />\nsubject to urban crime.

So<br />\nlet's all just agree not to question\u2014in the interest of time\u2014<br />\nthe Doctor's neat slicing of the<br />\ncomplexities of adolescence into three developmental phases:<br />\n\"During adolescence, three<br />\nstages of libido drive occur....The first stage is that of<br />\nnarcissism...in the next stage<br />\nthe teenager develops a love for<br />\nand strong friendship with someone of his own sex. This is<br />\nbecause the adolescent sees<br />\nhimself in this person. The third<br />\nand final stage is that of<br />\nheterosexual love where the<br />\nteenager has interest in developing a relation with a member of<br />\nthe opposite sex.\"<br />\nWell. I am absolutely flabbergasted that the good Doctor<br />\nseems to have forgotten about<br />\nat least ten percent of this<br />\nworld's population\u2014us gay<br />\nfolk. Remember, Dr. Godenne,<br />\nwe were declared normal just a<br />\nfew years back by your trade<br />\norganization. (And I was so<br />\nworried...) So that must mean<br />\nthat our adolescent developet is<br />\nnormal, too. Let your \"third<br />\nand final\" stage of heterosexual development was neither<br />\n3rd nor final for me.<br />\nSpeaking as just a normal<br />\nkind of guy, I resent your implications of arrested development. I am attracted to<br />\nmembers of my own sex not<br />\nbecause \"I see myself in them\"<br />\nbut because of all the corn-<br />\n<br />\nplicated and interdependent<br />\nfactors that make people fall in<br />\nlove, gay or straight,<br />\neverywhere. Heterosexuality is<br />\nno \"final\" stage. But it is<br />\nprecisely your kind of<br />\ndevelopmental model that has<br />\npermitted a straight society to<br />\nbanish gay and lesbian people<br />\nas abnormal for so long.<br />\nA lot of people on this campus read your views with a great<br />\ndeal of faith. Your position not<br />\nonly reinforces the prevailing<br />\nmyth of homosexuality as<br />\nstunted development or selfish<br />\nlove but far worse, makes the<br />\nmany gay people on this campus who are not yet comfortable with themselves and out<br />\nof the closet burrow back down<br />\na little deeper, buried by yet<br />\nanother load of doubt and selfcontempt.

I personally was accosted<br />\nlast Tuesday morning (10/30)<br />\nas I left Remsen Hall at 1:35<br />\na.m. heading to my McCoy<br />\napartment. I was chased down<br />\nthe driveway in front of MSE<br />\nby a man who had been lingering by the loading docks out-<br />\n<br />\nside of Remsen. I escaped due<br />\nonly to the appearance of<br />\nanother student from the south<br />\nside of MSE. I ran and screamed to him for help. The<br />\nassailant, who had chased me<br />\nfrom Remsen to beyond the<br />\nfront doors of the library, stopped at the sight of this student.<br />\nMy reasons for writing this<br />\nletter are twofold. First, I wish<br />\nto thank the student who came<br />\nto my aid. He was kind enough<br />\nto walk me home and offered<br />\nto wait with me for security. Second, I wish to comment on<br />\nSecurity's effectiveness on campus. It was more than 30<br />\nminutes after I called security<br />\nwhen an officer arrived at my<br />\napartment, bringing with him a<br />\nfantastic tale of their failed attempt to corner the man in the<br />\nlower quad using their cars.<br />\nThe officer assured me that<br />\nsecurity would be on foot<br />\npatrols throughout the night,<br />\nand escorting women home<br />\nfrom the Hut. He also told me<br />\nthat another woman had been<br />\nassaulted by this same man less<br />\nthan 20 yards from Remsen 10<br />\nminutes earlier (1:20 a.m.)<br />\nWhere was security after the<br />\nfirst incident? According to the<br />\noperator only one officer was<br />\navailable and he was with the<br />\nfirst victim. The other officer<br />\nwas patrolling Hopkins<br />\nvaluable off-campus property.<br />\nIf security had promptly footpatrolled the area the assailant<br />\nmight now be in custody. Instead this man is on the loose.<br />\nSecurity's claims of foot patrols<br />\nand escort service from the Hut<br />\n<br />\nwere forgotten after a few<br />\nhours.<br />\nIt is about time the powers<br />\nthat be realized that this is an<br />\nurban campus and should be<br />\nprotected as such.

A small minority<br />\nof students acquired a private<br />\nnewsletter, and not liking what<br />\nit said, tried and succeeded in<br />\npunishing its authors. I'm sure<br />\neverybody knows I'm talking<br />\nabout the \"TEP Newsletter\"<br />\nsituation.<br />\nIt does not matter what you<br />\nthought of the TEP Newsletter,<br />\nas it was not meant to be seen<br />\nby anybody but the TEP<br />\nbrothers. If I wrote my friend<br />\na letter, and put it in her<br />\nmailbox, but forgot to address<br />\nit, would somebody sharing<br />\nthat mailbox with her have the<br />\nright to make a judgement?<br />\nShould the Feminist Alliance<br />\nhave the right to check<br />\neveryone's mailbox, or would it<br />\nbe condoned for them to hire<br />\nthe KGB to do this (similar approaches by both organiza-<br />\n<br />\ntions)? And, if they didn't like<br />\nwhat a letter said, would it then<br />\nbe acceptable for them to make<br />\n1,000 copies and distribute<br />\nthem around campus, using<br />\nHopkins funds to make the<br />\ncopies? That's exactly what<br />\nhappened. The Women's<br />\nCenter did not like what the<br />\nTEP brothers were saying to<br />\neach other, so they tried to<br />\nostracize them.<br />\nThese tactics caused the<br />\nuniversity to give TEP a very<br />\nharsh penalty for a relatively<br />\nsmall mistake. Their only crime<br />\nwas not watching their \"scribe\"<br />\nclose enough for them to prevent him from using university<br />\nstationery. This was the only<br />\nHopkins rule that was broken,<br />\nyet TEP received one of the<br />\nmost severe penalties a<br />\nHopkins fraternity has ever<br />\nreceived. I will not disclose<br />\nit, because it is a private matter between the fraternity and<br />\nthe university.<br />\nYet, the Feminist Alliance<br />\ncopied the TEP Newsletter with<br />\nschool funds, they openly<br />\ndistributed a potentially offensive statemept which contained<br />\nthe official seal of the university, they illegally postered<br />\nHopkins and Goucher, they<br />\nbroke an agreement with TEP<br />\nand the university, and for<br />\nthese actions they are praised.<br />\nI am not asking that the<br />\nWomen's Center be punished<br />\nfor their \"activities,\" I am<br />\ndemanding it, and I will be submitting a petition that shows I<br />\nam not alone.<br />\nContinued on Page 11<br />\n<br />\nWEEKEND WONDER FLIX & THE (ISA PRESENT<br />\n\u2022\u2022\u2022*\u2022<br />\n\u2022<br />\n\u2022<br />\n\u2022<br />\n\u2022<br />\n\u2022<br />\n\u2022<br />\n\u2022<br />\n\u2022<br />\n\u2022<br />\n\u2022<br />\n<br />\n\u2022 C.<br />\n\u2022\u2022\u2022<br />\n<br />\n\u2022<br />\n<br />\n\u2022<br />\n\u2022<br />\n\u2022<br />\n\u2022<br />\n\u2022<br />\n\u2022e \u2022<br />\n<br />\n\u2022<br />\n\u2022<br />\n\u2022<br />\n\u2022<br />\n\u2022<br />\n<br />\n\u2022<br />\n<br />\n\u2022<br />\n<br />\nWinner010<br />\n-'-Academy A<br />\nid<br />\n<br />\nLik<br />\n<br />\nBEST ACTRESS:<br />\nLiza Minnelli<br />\nBEST SUPPORTING ACTOR:<br />\nJoel Grey.<br />\nBEST DIRECTOR:<br />\nBob Fosse<br />\nBEST ART DIRECTION<br />\nBEST CINEMATOGRAPHY<br />\nBEST FILM EDITING<br />\nBEST MUSIC SCORING<br />\nBEST SOUND<br />\n<br />\nTHURS NOV 15th<br />\n7:30 & 10:00 pm<br />\nSHRIVER HALL<br />\n<br />\nTRIP I<br />\nRif<br />\nEvERGREEN<br />\nHOUSE<br />\nA ATS<br />\n<br />\nNOV 13<br />\n<br />\n(7A0a) 15,13<br />\n<br />\n\u2022<br />\n<br />\nCott T0u<br />\n(04**i4 ovliv Mow<br />\nEt T IFMIN\u2022 w<br />\nkt 1141<br />\n3oos CU.<br />\n314W 00 AT Tilt UNICANO<br />\nMKT Air 2:413 w ;PAW Mit<br />\n<br />\nadmission $1.50<br />\n<br />\nNam0100001\u2022011ulliollomonomoomoollimilloonno111100001111111011101111111111110millomollomfolhoomomohoi<br />\n<br />\n\fNEWS-LETTER/11<br />\n<br />\nLetters continued<br />\nContinued from Page 10<br />\nWe cannot allow the<br />\nWomen's Center to continue<br />\nusurping power in this way.<br />\nThey claim to represent the<br />\nwomen of Hopkins, and attempt to substantiate their<br />\nclaim by saying they had 250<br />\nadvocates at their ad hoc<br />\nmeeting.

These<br />\nare severe sanctions in response<br />\nto something that has been<br />\nwritten. I hope Dr. Gryder's<br />\ntolerance improves if he is to<br />\nteach a course in which TEP<br />\nmembers are students. In this<br />\ncountry the press is protected,<br />\nhowever offensive to some the<br />\ntext of its printing may be.<br />\nFor shame, Dr. Gryder! The<br />\nwritten word, if not libelous or<br />\ntreasonous, must be protected.<br />\nIt is frightening to find a man<br />\nwhose life's work deals with<br />\nknowledge to be so eager to oppose the principles of the First<br />\n<br />\nAmendment.<br />\nRichard Barrans<br />\n<br />\nClarification<br />\nTo the Editor:<br />\nAs the chairperson of last<br />\nweek's ad-hoc assembly, allow<br />\nme to clarify several things appearing in the last Newsletter.<br />\nI am not a member of the<br />\nWomen's Center, though the<br />\nNewsletter mistakenly reported<br />\nthat I am. The fact is important<br />\nfor two reasons: as a graduate<br />\nwoman, I cannot belong to the<br />\nWomen's Center, nor does any<br />\ncommon group exist for<br />\ngraduates, undergraduates,<br />\nfaculty, and JHU employees interested in women's issues. This<br />\nis precisely one of the problems<br />\nthe ad-hoc committee wishes to<br />\naddress. Secondly, the activities<br />\nof the ad-hoc committee and its<br />\n<br />\nassembly have been consistently depicted as those of only the<br />\nWomen's Center. As my<br />\npresiding over the assembly, the<br />\npresence of 250 other people<br />\nthere, and an almost equal<br />\nbalance of males and females at<br />\nour Saturday informational rally suggest, the group and its<br />\nsupporters come from many<br />\nareas of the university<br />\nIn the interest of a fair account, I must also respond to<br />\nJennifer Kidd's editorial. The<br />\nman she cites as being told to<br />\nsit down because ours was a<br />\ndemocratic meeting was refusing to yield the floor after<br />\nspeaking well over the allotted<br />\ntime for speakers. Secondly,<br />\nMs. Kidd was not told to get<br />\nraped near Mudd Hall. She was<br />\nurged to be careful near Mudd,<br />\nwhere the last campus rape<br />\ntook place, because she expressed an alarming sense of in-<br />\n<br />\nvulnerability to campus<br />\nviolence. She had asserted that<br />\nsince Hopkins women \"know<br />\nwhere they are going\" in successful careers, the pornography and violence issues<br />\ndidn't concern her personally.<br />\nFinally, Ms. Kidd's perception that rape and sexual<br />\nharassment are unconnected<br />\nphenomena illustrates the profound misunderstanding of<br />\nsexual-social issues in the<br />\nHopkins community that has<br />\nmoved our group to action.<br />\nMany, many people have expressed willingness to support a<br />\nbetter policy and a greater commitment to women's issues al<br />\nJHU. If we clear the air 01<br />\nmisperceptions and begin to ad<br />\ndress the substantial problems<br />\nwe can begin to work togethe<br />\nin building a better enviror<br />\nment for all of us!<br />\nDeanna Shemek<br />\n<br />\nLloyd Melnik<br />\n<br />\nInfancy and Adolescence<br />\nTo the Editor:<br />\nJudging from their blustering<br />\nover the TEP newsletter and<br />\ntheir little rally Saturday on<br />\nparents' weekend, the women's<br />\ncenter must be in its infancy.<br />\nThey are really showing their<br />\nadolescence. Did they really expect to gain anyone's support<br />\nby their tactless (distributing<br />\nthe TEP letter and the rally) activities? There are far more pertinent concerns for the<br />\nWomen's Center to address,<br />\nsome of which I have supported. Yet the Women's<br />\nCenter has not been active in<br />\nthese. Instead, they went on a<br />\nmilitant propaganda blitz.<br />\nWhat is more difficult to<br />\nbelieve is that the Deans<br />\nrewarded this behavior by<br />\nsuspending TEP's social<br />\nprivileges and remaining ambivalent toward the Women's<br />\nCenter's own impropriety. Certainly if TEP is going to be held<br />\nresponsible for an internal<br />\nnewsletter, the center should be<br />\nheld responsible for its distribution. The administration has a<br />\npattern of being heavy-handed<br />\non the frats and social groups,<br />\nbut light on others. Who<br />\nremembers when the PSU invited the PLO,complete with a<br />\n\"security\" force, to campus.<br />\nDid they hold the PSU responsible for the assault and battery<br />\nof Hopkins students by PLO<br />\nsecurity, or for even inviting<br />\nthem here? No, they were in<br />\ntheir foxholes somewhere.<br />\nRichard Dynes<br />\n<br />\nFirst Amendment<br />\nTo the Editor:<br />\nI would ordinarily be hard<br />\npressed to find a written<br />\npassage more offensive than the<br />\nmuch-publicized TEP newsletter.

The next song,<br />\n\"Reign Of Blows (Vote No<br />\nViolence),\" ranks up there with<br />\nthe most political songs XTC<br />\nhas ever produced:\"By the half<br />\nlight of burning republics/ Joe<br />\nStalin looks just like Uncle<br />\nSam.\" This song is also interesting in that it is stylistically almost a parady of<br />\nmainstream American rock<br />\nwith its heavy chords and \"harmonic\" choruses.<br />\nThe next two songs, \"You're<br />\nThe Wish You Are I Had\" and<br />\n\"I<br />\nMoulding's<br />\nColin<br />\nRemember The Sun\" are probably the best pure songs on the<br />\nalbum. They are the proof that<br />\nsolid song writing is the base<br />\nunderneath the music and production. In fact,\"I Remember<br />\nThe Sun\" is a song worthy of<br />\nbeing placed in the Thirties and<br />\nForties\u2014the peak of pop song<br />\nwriting.<br />\nProbably the most interesting<br />\nsong on the album is the vaguely autobiographical \"Train<br />\nRunning Slow on Soul Coal.\"<br />\nOn the one hand, it's very<br />\nBritish\u2014to Americans, trains,<br />\nespecially coal powered ones,<br />\nare associated with the old<br />\n<br />\nWest. There just aren't many<br />\n\"train-spotters\" in suburban,<br />\nmiddle class America. On the<br />\nother hand, it is a continuation<br />\nof the XTC tradition of ending<br />\nan album with a down-beat<br />\nsong. It's a song that reflects<br />\nMr. Partridge's growing disenchantment with the music in:<br />\ndustry and his own doubts<br />\nabout the state of his<br />\nabilities\u2014\"I'm a thirty-year old<br />\npuppy doing what I'm told/<br />\nand I'm told there's no more<br />\ncoal for the older engines.\"<br />\n\"He's just a nut and he's<br />\ncracking,\" an obvious<br />\nreference to the doubts critics<br />\nhad about the state of his mental health after his stage fright<br />\ngot so bad that XTC had to<br />\nstop touring.<br />\nThe self-doubts are not warranted on the basis of this<br />\nalbum. There is still a whole lot<br />\nof \"soul coal\" left in Mr. Partridge and XTC in general. The<br />\nBig Express is XTC's Sgt. Pepper, quite an accomplishment.<br />\nYet, Sgt.

I<br />\nguess I just need someone to<br />\ntalk to .<br />\nSo began the final role play<br />\nof last week's peer-counseling<br />\ntraining session. It was a pleasant departure from the heavier<br />\ntopics brooched in earlier role<br />\nplays of the evening, yet it reinforced my observation: the<br />\nsizable workload of many<br />\nHopkins students, and the<br />\nlimitations of our community,<br />\nin part a result of off-campus<br />\nliving which often make us inaccessible to each other. We<br />\nhave a need here, for A Place<br />\nto Talk.<br />\n\"The group is bound by a<br />\ncommon sentiment that<br />\nHopkins fosters an attitude of<br />\nnon-involvement. In response<br />\nto this lack of community, they<br />\nproject themselves as a listening<br />\nforum,\" noted Clare King,<br />\nM.S.W. of the White House.<br />\nKing had been a supporter of<br />\npeer-counseling when the concept was introduced three years<br />\nHopkins<br />\na<br />\nby<br />\nago<br />\nundergraduate, and she led the<br />\ngroup through training this<br />\nsemester.<br />\nAdded Mike Purtell, who has<br />\nmobilized the group over the<br />\npast two semesters, \"We are<br />\nhere to help ease other students<br />\nthrough rough times, as well as<br />\nto reinforce the good. At times,<br />\na person simply needs an objective ear. We are trained<br />\nlisteners.\"<br />\nMimi Bianchi had known of<br />\nthe success other universities<br />\nhad with peer-counseling, and<br />\nthought Hopkins could benefit<br />\nfrom such an outreach program. She began corresponding<br />\nwith organizers of Harvard's<br />\nRoom Thirteen, the program<br />\nafter which A Place to Talk is<br />\nmodeled. This effort set the<br />\nwheels in motion.<br />\nLast semester the idea was introduced to the Hopkins community. A core of fifteen to<br />\nthirty students attended regular<br />\nmeetings, at which the structure<br />\nand direction of the program<br />\nwere mapped. Purtell cited<br />\nMargo McFarland, Deborah<br />\nNadelman, John Pedorolla,<br />\nand Rene Robinson for their input through this important<br />\nphase.<br />\nPurtell also mentioned that<br />\nwhile he spent much of the<br />\nsummer actively pursuing funds<br />\nfor the program, he was<br />\nnonetheless concerned that last<br />\nsemester's enthusiasm would<br />\ndissipate as academic demands<br />\nresumed this fall. This was not<br />\nthe case. Although new faces<br />\nhave replaced some, thirty<br />\nstudents from all four classes,<br />\nhave participated in this<br />\nsemester's training.<br />\nThe five weeks of rigorous<br />\n<br />\ntraining, completed this week,<br />\nemphasized the listening and<br />\ntechniques<br />\nquestioning<br />\nnecessary for effective peercounseling. Sessions were also<br />\npunctuated by the exchanges of<br />\nideas and concerns of these<br />\nfuture listening-counselors.<br />\nKing, pleased with the group's<br />\nprogress, commented, \"The<br />\nstudents in the group are<br />\nremarkably good and responsive listeners.\"<br />\nA Place to Talk, currently<br />\nbased in a room under Baker<br />\nHouse in AMR II, makes its<br />\ndebut on November 1.

Kuduk<br />\nThe National Football League's<br />\nsideline clothing style may have<br />\ntaken a turn for the worse this<br />\nweek. White shoes, white<br />\npants, designer hats are no<br />\nlonger in vogue, as John<br />\nMcKay orthe Tampa Bay Buccaneers announced his resignation, effective at the end of this<br />\nseason. The only head coach<br />\nwho looked as if he had just<br />\nwalked off the golf course every<br />\nweek cited health reasons for<br />\nhis resignation.<br />\nJohn McKay was one of the<br />\nmost successful NCAA coaches<br />\nin history. In the early seventies, USC was an institution<br />\nsynonymous with the Rose<br />\nBowl and football excellence.<br />\nThe Trojans captured nine<br />\nPac-8 championships under<br />\nMcKay in 16 seasons, graduating such NFL greats as<br />\n0.

But<br />\n<br />\nafter racking up a 121-37-8<br />\nrecord, John McKay decided to<br />\ntake up the greatest challenge<br />\nany head coach has to face.<br />\nIn the bicentennial year of<br />\ntheir inception, 1976, the Tampa Bay Buccaneers were synonymous with futility, losing all<br />\n14 games that season.

As Giuriceo<br />\nwas out of position, Bullet Joe<br />\nJohnson was presented with an<br />\nuntended net. With only the<br />\nsweet Homewood air between<br />\nhim and the goal, Johnson<br />\nshanked the ball and hit the<br />\npost, failing to cash in on his<br />\nteam's best scoring opportunity of the night.<br />\nThis was a big break for<br />\nHopkins, but as Giuriceo put it,<br />\n\"We're making our own<br />\nbreaks.

Here, junior<br />\nRob Nardino demonstrates this fact.<br />\n<br />\n\fNEWS-LETTER/27-<br />\n<br />\nStrokers<br />\n<br />\nareas finest<br />\n<br />\nMU Crew: A Team Effort<br />\n<br />\nHaircutting<br />\n3333n. charles<br />\n<br />\nby John Galotto<br />\nOverwhelmed with the<br />\nnumber of participants, the<br />\nHopkins crew is now trying to<br />\nbalance the conflicting interests<br />\nof building a varsity-level team<br />\nand accommodating the<br />\nmasses. Surprisingly enough,<br />\nthe team continues to exhibit<br />\nunity and dedication in the<br />\nabsence of a cause during the<br />\nfall season.<br />\nOnly in its third year of existence, the Hopkins' crew program now lies in an ambiguous<br />\ngrey area between a \"club\" and<br />\na \"team.\" According to Tim<br />\nRozan, president of Hopkins'<br />\ncrew, the program is not<br />\nrecognized as a \"varsity team,\"<br />\nbut for the first time this year<br />\nit is under Athletic Center<br />\njurisdiction. Thus it is receiving<br />\ngreater funds from the<br />\nHopkins' administration, a<br />\ntotal of $6000 this year. An additional $2100 will come from<br />\nfundraisers, Rozan claims.<br />\nThis figure pales in comparison to such totals as<br />\n$20,000 given to various Ivy<br />\nLeague crew teams by their<br />\nrespective administrations<br />\n(Rozan cites the University of<br />\nPennsylvania as an example of<br />\nthis generosity). The lack of<br />\nfunds relative to the number of<br />\nparticipants (70 on the men's<br />\nand women's teams together)<br />\nhas caused numerous problems.<br />\n\"I need more coaches,\" explained Head Coach Doug<br />\nSargeant. \"I have three crews<br />\nto coach, so I have to resort to<br />\ndoing drills; I just can't pay individual attention as much as<br />\nI'd like. I usually end up<br />\nscreaming myself hoarse.\"<br />\nSargeant says he would like to<br />\nsee at least one coach for each<br />\ncrew.<br />\nThe crew's youth and corresponding lack of funds also<br />\ncreates other problems. In<br />\norder to give attention to the<br />\nhuge number of novices,<br />\nSargeant claims he needs a rowing barge (a stationary boat<br />\nsimulation), which would both<br />\nimprove technique and enable<br />\nSargeant to more easily discern<br />\n<br />\nand correct mistakes.<br />\nThe main problem, however,<br />\nis an overabundance of people<br />\nand only four boats. What<br />\nresults is a teaming up of experienced rowers with novices<br />\nin the same shell and a limiting<br />\nof practice time available to the<br />\nveterans. However, Sargeant<br />\nrefuses to cut any fall participants to allow for more concentrated attention. He states<br />\nbluntly, \"Having so many people certainly causes problems.<br />\nBut it's worth it. Sure it<br />\nsometines screws up the experienced people, but [having<br />\nveterans and novices row<br />\ntogether] is the fairest way to do<br />\nit, so we can develop everyone<br />\nequally.\"<br />\nRozan<br />\nelaborates,<br />\n\"Everyone's got to make<br />\nsacrifices for everyone. We<br />\ncan't kick out the novices,<br />\nbecause they're the future of<br />\nHopkins' crews, and everyone<br />\nknows that. If the novices do<br />\nwell, the program should take<br />\noff in the future.\" Being one of<br />\nthe veterans \"sacrificed,\"<br />\nRozan adds that frystration is<br />\ninevitable but must be taken in<br />\nstride.<br />\n\"I was the coxswain at<br />\nGeorgetown and it was the best<br />\nthing I ever did in my life,\" explained Sargeant.\"Now I want<br />\nto teach as many other people<br />\nto do it as possible. It's very<br />\nfulfilling to see these kids<br />\ndevelop; some real klutzes can<br />\ndevelop into fine athletes.<br />\n\"Crew can be like a religious<br />\nexperience. You learn to go<br />\nbeyond yourself; it's an antiego thing. You're in the boat<br />\nwith eight other people and the<br />\nboat is only as fast as the<br />\nweakest link. There are no<br />\nheroes\u2014you rise and fall as a<br />\nteam. It's really worth teaching<br />\nthose values to other people,\"<br />\nhe said.<br />\nThese values are indeed<br />\nshared by the crew team<br />\nmembers. Pam Cort, a coxswaine, claims that \"crew is the<br />\nmost integrated team sport. It's<br />\na great feeling because all nine<br />\nof you are one person.\"<br />\nWith the exhilaration,<br />\n<br />\nOffering<br />\nStudent<br />\nDiscounts<br />\nWith<br />\nI.D.<br />\nHAIR STUDIO<br />\n<br />\nhowever, comes a lot of hard<br />\nnext to<br />\nwork.

Learning<br />\ncrew has been more than a<br />\nphysical expereince, but also an<br />\nemotional experience.

She said she<br />\nhoped that a sexual harassment<br />\nprogram could be combined<br />\nwith a program on other fraternity issues, such as alcohol<br />\npolicy and community relations. She said she was working<br />\non that before the TEP incident<br />\noccurred.<br />\nPorter said she would like to<br />\nsee the national fraternities<br />\nsend representatives to such a<br />\nforum, and that their response<br />\nhas been positive. She hopes to<br />\nhold the event early next<br />\nsemester.<br />\n\"We started talking about<br />\nthis long before this particular<br />\nissue [the TEP newsletter] came<br />\nup,\" Porter said.<br />\nFisher and VandeLInde announced the appointment of<br />\nLeys last week.<br />\nFisher said that Leys' chief<br />\nresponsibility will be \"giving<br />\nDean VandeLinde and myself a<br />\nclear, organized sense as to the<br />\nnature of women's issues at<br /><br />\nHopkins.\"<br />\nLeys said whe believes her<br />\nrole will be to \"try to inform<br />\nthem [Fisher and VandeLinde]<br />\nabout some of the issues that<br />\nhave surfaced and to try to<br />\nwork with them to develop appropriate responses to the<br />\nissues.\"<br />\nShe also noted that as a result<br />\nof this appointment, her advising duties have been reduced.<br />\nJohn Gryder, who recently<br />\nreturned to teaching after serving as associate dean of Arts<br />\nand Sciences, will take over the<br />\nadvising of freshmen and<br />\nsophomores, according to<br />\nLeys.<br />\n\"I do regard this new position as an important one,\"<br />\nLeys said,\"and one to which I<br />\nam devoting a great deal of<br />\ntime.\"<br />\nLeys said that she did not<br />\n\"have any agenda\" of issues<br />\nwith which she wants to deal.<br />\n\"I am doing a great deal of<br />\nlistening,\" Leys said, noting<br />\nthat she was appointed to her<br />\nnew position less than two<br />\nweeks ago.<br />\nLeys also said that she hasn't<br />\ndecided if a more formalized<br />\nprocedure for dealing with<br />\nt.umplaints of sexual harassment should be established.<br />\nFollowing the TEP newsletter<br />\nincident, the Feminist Alliance<br />\n(formerly called the Women's<br />\nCenter) had demanded the<br />\nestablishment of such a<br />\nprocedure.<br /><br />\nFisher said that Leys would<br />\ndeal with this issue, but not exclusively.

She<br />\nadded that this was in part due<br />\nto the fact that \"the university<br />\nhasn't made any concessions<br />\nother than the appointment of<br />\nLeys.\"<br />\nIn yet another related matter,<br />\nOki said that the Feminist<br />\nAlliance is researching the<br />\npossibility of holding a forum<br />\non sexual harassment. Two<br />\nweeks ago, TEP promised to<br />\nwork with the Alliance on<br />\norganizing such a forum. Oki<br />\nsaid that the research is still in<br />\nthe preliminary stages, and that<br />\nthe Alliance has not yet contacted TEP on the issue.<br /><br />\nAssaults<br />\n*In separate incidents, two<br />\nstudents were assaulted while<br />\nwalking on the freshman quad<br />\non Oct. 30. The first incident<br />\noccured at 1:25 a.m., when a<br />\nfemale student was grabbed<br />\nby a male suspect. The student<br />\nthen slammed her key into the<br />\nassailant's stomach, who<br />\nbacked away. The second incident, which was similar, occured at 1:40 a.m. The area<br />\nwas searched, but the results<br />\nwere negative. Following the<br />\nincidents, a walking escort<br />\nwas established from the Hut<br />\nby security.<br />\n\u2022At about 11:10 a.m. on<br />\nOct. 30, the complainant was<br />\napproached by four males at<br />\n32nd and St. Paul Streets.<br />\nOne of the men produced a<br />\nhand gun and demanded her<br />\nmoney. The complainant<br />\nturned over her back pack,<br />\nwhich contained money and a<br />\ntape recorder. The subjects<br />\nthen ran south on St. Paul<br />\nstreet. The complainant was<br />\nnot injured, and the total loss<br />\nwas $102.00.<br />\n*While leaving the campus<br />\nby the Wyman Park gate at<br />\n10:00 p.m. on Oct. 30, an<br />\nevening college student was<br />\naccosted by three male<br />\nsuspects. The victim was<br />\nknocked to the ground and<br />\nbeaten about the head and<br /><br />\nbody with a nunchakus. The<br />\nvictim's pants, underclothing<br />\nand shoes were removed. The<br />\nvictim's wallet, containing<br />\n$130.00 and personal papers,<br />\nwas also taken. He staggered<br />\nout onto Art Museum Drive,<br />\nwhere he was picked up by the<br />\nBaltimore City Police. Three<br />\nsuspects were arrested and<br />\ncharged with this offence after<br />\nbeing-picked up in the 2500<br />\nblock of Charles St. Complainant made a positive identification of suspects.

We, as students and as citizens, are<br />\njustifiably concerned about this situation. It<br />\nseems there is little we can do, however, to<br />\nrectify the problem.<br />\nMembers of the Homewood community<br />\nshould beable to rely upon the protection<br />\nand support activities of the campus security force. Unfortunately, the services provided by this organization are often inadequate<br />\nand, when present, seem dangerously slow.<br />\nWe feel this may be attributed to a severe<br />\nsecurity manpower shortage and, in light of<br />\ncurrent events, this dilemma must be addressed immediately.<br />\nNot only do we demand that the security<br />\nforce be strengthened in order to better protect the campus, but also that its activities<br />\nbe extended to provide adequate security to<br />\nthose students living off campus. This is not<br />\nan unreasonable nor an inappropriate request. The vast majority of Hopkins students<br />\nreside off campus and the library shuttle service, while useful, is an incomplete safety<br /><br />\nprovision.<br />\nWe would not suggest that security officers be stationed at every corner in Charles<br />\nVillage or in Hampden. Rather, we insist<br />\nthat the University provide the means to improve the existing system. More security personnel should be hired. Regular foot and<br />\nautomobile patrols should be implemented<br />\nand students informed of their schedule. Better lighting equipment should be installed at<br />\nHomewood, especially along well-travelled<br />\npaths. Campus emergency phones and a foot<br />\nescort service originating at the library, suggested by the Student Life committee of the<br />\nStudent Council, are likewise appropriate<br />\nmeasures.<br />\nUntil the Johns Hopkins University<br />\nrecognizes that a safety deficit exists and<br />\nbegins to take effective action, we urge all<br />\nstudents to exercise caution, especially in the<br />\nevening. Avoid taking chances which might<br />\nendanger your well-being, such as walking<br />\nhome alone at 2:00 a.m. from the Hut or a<br />\nweekend party. Be aware that you are living in a city which has one of the highest per<br />\ncapita crime rates in the country.<br /><br />\nLetters<br />\n\"Strong Intuitive Sense\"<br />\nTo the Editor:<br />\nI am responding to an article<br />\nby Stephen Pimentel in the<br />\nNov. 2 Newsletter, concerning<br />\n\"Freedom of Thought at<br />\nPimentel<br />\nMr.<br />\nJHU.\"<br />\ncharacterizes the Women's<br />\nCenter's proposals concerning grievance procedures as<br />\n\"perfectly sound\" but \"not the<br />\nreal issue.\" He then urges us to<br />\nconsider proper responses to<br />\n\"admittedly obnoxious\" atbehavior.<br />\nand<br />\ntitudes<br />\nSomething interesting happens<br />\nto Mr. Pimentel's argument:<br />\nin the second paragraph, the<br />\nquality of being \"obnoxious,\"<br />\n\"offensive,\" and \"objectionable\" migrates from \"attitudes and behavior\" to<br />\n\"responses.\" Does Mr. Pimentel wish to contrast the<br />\n\"sound\" response of the<br />\nFeminist Alliance with the other<br />\nirrational,<br />\n\"hysterical,\"<br />\n\"thoroughly authoritarian\"<br />\nresponses he cites? Not so fast:<br />\nthe Alliance has not, after all,<br />\nresponded properly. The connection they perceive between<br />\nactions and attitudes \"makes<br />\nexplicit what they really want to<br />\ncontrol: people's thoughts and<br />\nactions\" (p.10).<br />\nNow I object not only to the<br />\ncircular appearance of this<br />\nargument, but to its premises.<br />\nI take it that Mr. Pimentel's<br />\nfinal identification of the<br />\nAlliance's aims with those of<br />\nOrwell's Big Brother rests on<br />\nsomething less slippery than a<br /><br />\n\"strong intuitive sense\"\u2014<br />\nnamely, disagreement with the<br />\npremise that attitudes and actions are in some broad sense<br />\nrelated. While no one would<br />\nassert their total conformity, if<br />\nMr. Pimentel denies them any<br />\ncausal connection he requires<br />\nmore powerful artillery than a<br />\n\"strong intuitive sense.\"<br />\nThis \"strong intuitive sense\"<br />\nseems to have led Mr. Pimentel into two not insubstantial<br />\nmisunderstandings (p. 10). A<br />\ngentleman who persists in<br />\nmonopolizing a discussion<br />\namong over a hundred people,<br />\nwho fails to respect the<br />\nmoderator, lays himself open to<br />\nless official guidance: \"shut<br />\nup.\" Regrettable perhaps...<br />\nbut so is filibustering. Mr.<br />\nPimentel's implausible suggestion that an architect of the<br />\nstanding grievance procedure<br />\nfor sexual harassment invited<br />\nJennifer Kidd to \"get raped\" is<br />\nincorrect. Ms. Kidd's position:<br />\n\"I think I am no victim, ergo<br />\nno one can make me one.\"<br />\nWould this were so\u2014but acting<br />\non such beliefs may leave us<br />\nmore than merely mistaken; it<br />\nshould not be improper to point<br />\nthis out.<br />\nMr. Pimentel argues the impropriety of \"policing\" imagination and fiction. Alas! Is<br />\na member of the Alliance standing at the door of every<br />\nbrother's id in top boots with a<br />\nwhip? But enough rhetoric. No<br />\none has the ability to intervene<br />\nwith, to alter, to halt your<br />\nthoughts, Mr. Pimentel,<br />\nunless you so choose. Cultural<br /><br />\nnorms, especially institutional<br />\nnorms\u2014and texts, fictional or<br />\nfactual, create, perpetuate, and<br />\ndefend such norms\u2014may exert<br />\npressure upon, but cannot compel you to think anything at all.<br />\nYou object to an illusory violation, you do so on a fallacious<br />\nargument, and you fall afoul of<br />\nthe irrationality you deplore in<br />\nothers. Further, the shift in<br />\nyour focus from offenders to<br />\nrespondents\u2014whose offense<br />\ncannot lie in coercion and hence<br />\nmust lie in dissent\u2014replicates<br />\nthe policing move which<br />\nfrightens you. In your piece,<br />\nMr. Pimentel, it is not the<br />\nproducers of obscene material,<br />\nbut the Alliance, who are the<br />\ncoercive authors, the imaginative rapists, the outlaws<br />\nwho threaten to control the<br />\nsystem and with it our bodies,<br />\nour minds, our texts.<br />\nThe consistency with which<br />\nsuch arguments seek to penalize<br />\nvoices of dissent in this and<br />\nother communities does not excuse their own wilfullness and<br />\ninconsistency.<br />\nM. Fuller<br />\nDept. of English, JHU<br /><br />\nWhere's Granny?<br />\nTo the Editor:<br />\nWhere has Granny the Campus Cop been lately? I wish I<br />\nknew. Last Wednesday night, I<br />\nreturned from a Halloween party in Georgetown at 3:30 a.m.<br />\nThere were no parking spaces<br />\nnear my apartment, so I had to<br />\npark in Homewood Garage,<br /><br />\ntwo blocks away. Not bad at 3<br />\np.m., but not a pleasing<br />\nthought at 3 a.m.!! So I figured<br />\nI'd drive on to campus, find a<br />\nsecurity officer, and ask him to<br />\nescort me the two blocks (not<br />\nan unreasonable request with<br />\nall the assaults lately). But, to<br />\nmy surprise, there were no<br />\nsecurity officers to be found. I<br />\ndrove around both ends of<br />\ncampus looking everywhere for<br />\n15 minutes, and I couldn't find<br />\na trace of a security officer. No<br />\ncars. Nothing. Campus was<br />\ndead, sure, but security should<br />\nalways be available. Nice in<br />\ntheory, but in practice I had to<br />\nwalk home alone from the<br />\nGarage (which, by the way, is<br />\npoorly lit outside because the<br />\nmain light has been out for over<br />\na month).<br />\nSecurity at Hopkins needs to<br />\nbe seriously re-evaluated and<br />\nimproved upon. The Student<br />\nServices Committee is in the<br />\nprocess of getting security<br />\nphones installed around campus and that's great. But we still<br />\nneed more. Security officers in<br />\npatrol cars (with the windows<br />\nopen) should be stationed on<br />\neach road into campus at night.<br />\nIf someone needs a security officer, they'll know where to<br />\nfind one.<br />\nSharon Sirota<br />\nClass of 1985<br /><br />\nNo Taxonomy<br />\nTo the Editor:<br />\nYour columnist, Stephen<br />\nPimentel, is certainly correct in<br />\nparaphrasing my letter as<br />\n\"TEP Newsletter\u2014Ugh!!\" except that \"Ugh!!\" is insufficiently harsh. Perhaps \"Expletive deleted!!!!\" would have<br />\nbeen better. My letter was written, typed, and mailed within<br />\none hour of my reading the<br />\n\"TEP Newsletter\" and was only meant to show the outrage of<br />\none male faculty member.<br />\nI find it sad that only one other<br />\nletter from a male in support of<br />\nthe position of the Feminist<br />\nAlliance has been published. I<br />\nfind it depressing that several<br /><br />\nwomen have come to the<br />\ndefense of TEP. But this<br />\nresponse from the student body<br />\ndoes explain why the author of<br />\nthe \"TEP Newsletter\" and the<br />\nfraternity apologized for the<br />\nwrong offenses. The attitudes<br />\nwhich surfaced in the \"TEP<br />\nNewsletter\" are much more<br />\nwidespread than I would have<br />\nexpected in a group of highly<br />\nintelligent young people. I<br />\nwould have expected their<br />\ngeneration to instruct mine<br />\nabout these matters.<br />\nLet me make explicit the<br />\nreasons I objected so strenuously to the \"TEP Newsletter.\" It<br />\nwas not the sexual content<br />\nwhich offended me. It was the<br />\nway in which the violent<br />\ndegradation of human beings<br />\nwas considered to be an appropriate topic for jest.<br />\nThroughout history, one of<br />\nthe ways in which society has<br />\nkept groups in an inferior position has been to brutalize them<br />\nby using language to imply that<br />\ntheir status is comparable to<br />\nthat of lower animals and to<br />\ntreat physical violence against<br />\nthem as humorous. It is only<br />\nwhen polite society is sufficiently inured to the acceptability of<br />\nless than human status for a<br />\ngroup that the group can be<br />\nmaintained in its inferior role.<br />\nAfter all, the\".tuck-up\" ones<br />\nwill have to be slapped down<br />\nfrom time to time in ways that<br />\nwould be wrong if applied to<br />\nequals. Certainly members of<br />\nthe polite society will not be involved in the lynchings of \"uppity niggers,\"the firebombings<br />\nof \"kike\" stores, or the raping<br />\nof \"stuck-up broads.\" We<br />\nleave these acts to others, but<br />\nsomehow we frequently do not<br />\nmete out the same punishment<br />\nto perpetrators of these acts as<br />\nwe do for -imilar offenses<br />\nagainst one of our own. After<br />\nall, they asked for it in one way<br />\nor another.

The<br />\ntheory one most often hears<br />\namong Democrats explaining<br />\nReagan's popularity is that people like Reagan's style and image and hence are willing to ignore his positions on policy<br />\nissues. This theory is sometimes<br />\nstated in more dramatic<br />\nlanguage in which Reagan is<br />\nsaid to be coated with a magical<br />\nTeflon-like substance (perhaps<br />\ncreated by a mad right-wing<br />\nscientist) which causes any<br />\ncriticism cast in his direction to<br />\nbounce away. However stated,<br />\nthe basic notion underlying this<br />\ntheory is unsupported by<br />\nevidence.<br />\nFor example, in the<br />\nNewsweek poll taken after the<br />\nfirst debate, a substantial majority (54 to 35) thought that<br />\nMondale had performed better<br />\nthan Reagan. However, when<br />\nthese same people were asked<br />\nwhich candidate better reflected<br />\ntheir views on policy issues,<br />\nReagan won by as large a<br />\nmargin (57 to 38). If there was<br /><br />\nany dichotomy between \"images and issues,\" it worked in<br />\nMondale's favor.<br />\nUndue preoccupation with<br />\nReagan's image has already<br />\ndone considerable mischief in<br />\nthe Democratic party and promises to do even more. Inevitably, Democratic politicians<br />\nhave begun to imitate what they<br />\nerroneously consider to be the<br />\nsources of Reagan's success,<br />\nand the resulting spectacle is<br />\nhumorous indeed. Mario<br />\nCuomo, the Governor of New<br />\nYork, provides an egregious,<br />\nthough entertaining, example<br />\nof this phenomenon. Cuomo<br />\nhabitually apes the worst<br />\naspects of Republican politics,<br />\nsputtering about \"God,\"<br />\n\"mother,\" and \"family\" at<br />\nevery opportunity. Equally uncomforting beneath the<br />\nmoralistic rhetoric, he espouses<br />\nthe same old programmatic<br />\nliberalism of the ever successful<br />\nWalter Mondale. In Mario<br />\nCuomo, we are treated to the<br />\nworst of both worlds.<br />\nIf Cuomo and other<br />\nDemocrats suppose that it is<br />\nReagan's goof-ball traditionalism which accounts for<br />\nhis popularity, they are seriously mistaken. As Mondale inout<br />\npointed<br />\ncessantly<br />\nthroughout the campaign, there<br />\n.are real policy differences bet-<br /><br />\nween Reagan and the<br />\nDemocrats, and it is precisely<br />\non the basis of these differences<br />\nthat Reagan has been winning.<br />\nLiberal Democrats intuitively<br />\nunderstand the implications of<br />\nthis statement, and hence spend<br />\nlarge amounts of energy attempting to deny it. Like spurned lovers, they refuse to admit<br />\nit is so, preferring instead to<br />\nconstruct dubious explanations<br />\nof their condition: Mondale's<br />\nmessage did not \"get across,\"<br />\nor the voters were unaware of<br />\nReagan's policies, or maybe<br />\nthey were blindly infatuated<br />\nwith that lump in Reagan's<br />\nhair. \"Explanations\" of this<br />\nsort were vaguely plausible<br />\nafter the 1980 election; today,<br />\nthey are simply silly. Most people know the basic thrust of<br />\nReagan's policies perfectly well<br />\nand made their decision<br />\naccordingly.<br />\nNevertheless, there is still<br />\nhope for a Democratic revival.<br />\nThe electorate has rejected not<br />\nliberalism itself, but only the<br />\nstatist variety thereof as espoused by the Democratic party in<br />\nrecent decades. Many people<br />\nhave come to view with the<br />\nphilosophy of big government<br />\nas outdated, more attuned to<br />\nthe Depression era conditions<br />\nof the 1930s than to a period of<br />\nrapid technological change.<br /><br />\nLetters continued<br />\nContinued from Page 8<br />\nbody, including many who plan<br />\nmedical careers, can consider<br />\nany depiction of violent<br />\ndegradation of other human beings as being humorous. It is<br />\nmore than dismaying, it is<br />\nfrightening when one considers<br />\nthe ever more complex ethical<br />\nquestions which many of them<br />\nwill have to face as further advances are made in medicine. I<br />\nthink of the group of black men<br />\nwho were used for decades to<br />\nstudy untreated syphilis in a<br />\nproject funded by the United<br />\nStates government long after an<br />\neffective cure was available.<br />\nHowever, I still believe in the<br />\nperfectability of mankind. If<br />\nthe affair of the \"TEP Newsletter\" can be used to make us all<br />\nconsider the subtle and not so<br />\nsubtle ways in which society<br />\n\"keeps women in their place,\"<br /><br />\nthe Women's Center has served us well by publicizing the offensive writing.<br />\nYour columnist and others<br />\nwho have written me have interpreted my letter as indicating<br />\nthat I would support thought<br />\ncontrol or censorship. I plead<br />\nnot guilty. I would oppose censorship of Penthouse, Hustler,<br />\nand Screw. It is quite another<br />\nmatter, however, to have such<br />\nwriting emanate from a group<br />\nofficially recognized by Johns<br />\nHopkins. I would, for example,<br />\noppose the publication of any<br />\nof these magazines from the<br />\nJohns Hopkins Press.<br />\nFinally, from time to time, I<br />\nhave been embarrassed by my<br />\nspecies, my sex, and my country.

However, these<br />\nbeliefs need not exclusively aid<br />\nthe Republicans.

It is difficult to see how<br />\nthe Democrats are going to be<br />\nsignificantly aided by merely<br />\nstylistic changes. What is needed is a thoroughgoing neoliberalism of a sort which places<br />\na considerably greater emphasis<br />\non individual freedom and<br />\ninitiative.<br />\nIf the prospects of the<br />\nDemocratic party are to rise, it<br />\nis crucial for Democrats to<br />\nunderstand that there is no<br />\nreturning to the status quo ante.<br />\nReagan now lays claim to a<br />\nsolid third of FDR's old coalition while holding traditional<br />\nRepublican voters firmly in<br />\nplace.

Which<br />\nbrings us to one of four points:<br />\nWhere are the security guards?<br />\nLast Monday night a student<br />\nwas told that it would take at<br />\nleast thirty minutes for a escort<br />\nbecause the operator was<br />\nunable to contact any of the<br />\nsecurity units. Two weeks ago<br />\na student waited over half an<br />\nhour for a security guard after<br />\nhaving reported being chased<br />\nby a man on campus.<br />\nWhat do the security guards<br />\ndo? On average, each shift has<br />\nfive security personnel. The<br />\nnorth end of campus is patrolled by one person in a car and<br />\none person on foot. The south<br />\nend of campus is patrolled in a<br />\nsimilar manner. The officers on<br />\nfoot are responsible for checking buildings and accessing<br />\nthem to University personnel.<br />\nThe remaining guard is responsible for inspecting off campus<br />\nUniversity housing.<br />\nThe number of security<br />\nguards working each shift is less<br />\nthan is needed to ensure the<br />\nsafety of the campus. There<br />\nshould be highly visible pairs of<br />\nguards patrolling all three<br />\nquads and the path by the Art<br />\nMuseum which is heavily frequented and has very poor<br /><br />\nlighting. An increase in personnel will be costly, but in questions of the safety of students,<br />\nfaculty, and staff, money<br />\nshould not be the prime<br />\nconsideration.<br />\nBecause Hopkins is not a<br />\nresidential campus, there is a<br />\nneed to be aware of what is<br />\nhappening in the surrounding<br />\narea. More than half of the student body lives off campus in<br />\nprivately owned and University owned housing. Last week,<br />\na brutal assault occurred in a<br />\nprivately-owned apartment<br />\nbuilding in Charles Village.<br />\nWith the present state of security in University-owned housing,<br />\nthe perpetrator could have easily entered the dorms or any<br />\nUniversity-owned<br />\nother<br />\nresidential hall. At a forum on<br />\nCampus Security, Major<br />\nLarkin, Security Manager, read<br />\nsome Charles Village crime<br />\nstatistics. The area where the<br />\nmost sexual assualts occur is<br />\nCalvert and 29th streets. The<br />\nUniversity has a responsibility<br />\nto 1) make all University<br />\nresidential halls more secure<br />\nand 2) continually stress to<br />\nstudents the need to heed all<br />\nsecurity precautions on and off<br />\ncampus. The students should<br />\ntake an active role in their safety by keeping informed of and<br />\nusing all security mesures. Using the intercom system in<br />\nWolman and McCoy may be an<br />\ninconvenience, but it is one<br />\nmeasure that already exists and<br />\nshould be used. Leaving the<br />\ndoors propped open is an invitation for trouble.<br />\nThe Baltimore Sun just<br />\npublished statistics showing<br />\nthat the city of Baltimore has<br />\n\u2022 the third highest rate of crime<br />\nper capita in the country.<br />\nHopkins is an urban campus<br />\nsubject to urban crime. We<br />\nneed urban security measures.<br /><br />\n10/NOVEMBER 9, 1984<br /><br />\nLetters continued<br />\nContinued from Page 9<br />\nhard.<br />\nBut that's probably more a<br />\nquibble with the field than with<br />\nDr. Godenne in particualr. So<br />\nlet's all just agree not to question\u2014in the interest of time\u2014<br />\nthe Doctor's neat slicing of the<br />\ncomplexities of adolescence into three developmental phases:<br />\n\"During adolescence, three<br />\nstages of libido drive occur....The first stage is that of<br />\nnarcissism...in the next stage<br />\nthe teenager develops a love for<br />\nand strong friendship with someone of his own sex. This is<br />\nbecause the adolescent sees<br />\nhimself in this person. The third<br />\nand final stage is that of<br />\nheterosexual love where the<br />\nteenager has interest in developing a relation with a member of<br />\nthe opposite sex.\"<br />\nWell. I am absolutely flabbergasted that the good Doctor<br />\nseems to have forgotten about<br />\nat least ten percent of this<br />\nworld's population\u2014us gay<br />\nfolk. Remember, Dr. Godenne,<br />\nwe were declared normal just a<br />\nfew years back by your trade<br />\norganization. (And I was so<br />\nworried...) So that must mean<br />\nthat our adolescent developet is<br />\nnormal, too. Let your \"third<br />\nand final\" stage of heterosexual development was neither<br />\n3rd nor final for me.<br />\nSpeaking as just a normal<br />\nkind of guy, I resent your implications of arrested development. I am attracted to<br />\nmembers of my own sex not<br />\nbecause \"I see myself in them\"<br />\nbut because of all the corn-<br /><br />\nplicated and interdependent<br />\nfactors that make people fall in<br />\nlove, gay or straight,<br />\neverywhere. Heterosexuality is<br />\nno \"final\" stage. But it is<br />\nprecisely your kind of<br />\ndevelopmental model that has<br />\npermitted a straight society to<br />\nbanish gay and lesbian people<br />\nas abnormal for so long.<br />\nA lot of people on this campus read your views with a great<br />\ndeal of faith. Your position not<br />\nonly reinforces the prevailing<br />\nmyth of homosexuality as<br />\nstunted development or selfish<br />\nlove but far worse, makes the<br />\nmany gay people on this campus who are not yet comfortable with themselves and out<br />\nof the closet burrow back down<br />\na little deeper, buried by yet<br />\nanother load of doubt and selfcontempt. That's dangerous,<br />\nand you should reassure them,<br />\nand enlighten the rest of us\u2014<br />\ngay<br />\nand<br />\nstraight\u2014and<br />\napologize.<br />\nJonathan Katz<br />\nGrad Student\u2014Art History<br /><br />\nWhere's Security?<br />\nTo the Editor:<br />\nThere have been several<br />\nassaults and attempted assaults<br />\nof women on campus this past<br />\nweek. I personally was accosted<br />\nlast Tuesday morning (10/30)<br />\nas I left Remsen Hall at 1:35<br />\na.m. heading to my McCoy<br />\napartment. I was chased down<br />\nthe driveway in front of MSE<br />\nby a man who had been lingering by the loading docks out-<br /><br />\nside of Remsen. I escaped due<br />\nonly to the appearance of<br />\nanother student from the south<br />\nside of MSE. I ran and screamed to him for help. The<br />\nassailant, who had chased me<br />\nfrom Remsen to beyond the<br />\nfront doors of the library, stopped at the sight of this student.<br />\nMy reasons for writing this<br />\nletter are twofold. First, I wish<br />\nto thank the student who came<br />\nto my aid. He was kind enough<br />\nto walk me home and offered<br />\nto wait with me for security. Second, I wish to comment on<br />\nSecurity's effectiveness on campus. It was more than 30<br />\nminutes after I called security<br />\nwhen an officer arrived at my<br />\napartment, bringing with him a<br />\nfantastic tale of their failed attempt to corner the man in the<br />\nlower quad using their cars.<br />\nThe officer assured me that<br />\nsecurity would be on foot<br />\npatrols throughout the night,<br />\nand escorting women home<br />\nfrom the Hut. He also told me<br />\nthat another woman had been<br />\nassaulted by this same man less<br />\nthan 20 yards from Remsen 10<br />\nminutes earlier (1:20 a.m.)<br />\nWhere was security after the<br />\nfirst incident? According to the<br />\noperator only one officer was<br />\navailable and he was with the<br />\nfirst victim. The other officer<br />\nwas patrolling Hopkins<br />\nvaluable off-campus property.<br />\nIf security had promptly footpatrolled the area the assailant<br />\nmight now be in custody. Instead this man is on the loose.<br />\nSecurity's claims of foot patrols<br />\nand escort service from the Hut<br /><br />\nwere forgotten after a few<br />\nhours.<br />\nIt is about time the powers<br />\nthat be realized that this is an<br />\nurban campus and should be<br />\nprotected as such. The ineffectiveness of security has been<br />\nshown. The coffee breaks in<br />\ntheir cars must end.

Many have read the<br />\nbook; most know the plot: Big<br />\nBrother controlling everyone's<br />\nlives. Recently, this scenario<br />\nbecame a step closer to reality<br />\nat Hopkins. A small minority<br />\nof students acquired a private<br />\nnewsletter, and not liking what<br />\nit said, tried and succeeded in<br />\npunishing its authors. I'm sure<br />\neverybody knows I'm talking<br />\nabout the \"TEP Newsletter\"<br />\nsituation.<br />\nIt does not matter what you<br />\nthought of the TEP Newsletter,<br />\nas it was not meant to be seen<br />\nby anybody but the TEP<br />\nbrothers. If I wrote my friend<br />\na letter, and put it in her<br />\nmailbox, but forgot to address<br />\nit, would somebody sharing<br />\nthat mailbox with her have the<br />\nright to make a judgement?<br />\nShould the Feminist Alliance<br />\nhave the right to check<br />\neveryone's mailbox, or would it<br />\nbe condoned for them to hire<br />\nthe KGB to do this (similar approaches by both organiza-<br /><br />\ntions)? And, if they didn't like<br />\nwhat a letter said, would it then<br />\nbe acceptable for them to make<br />\n1,000 copies and distribute<br />\nthem around campus, using<br />\nHopkins funds to make the<br />\ncopies? That's exactly what<br />\nhappened. The Women's<br />\nCenter did not like what the<br />\nTEP brothers were saying to<br />\neach other, so they tried to<br />\nostracize them.<br />\nThese tactics caused the<br />\nuniversity to give TEP a very<br />\nharsh penalty for a relatively<br />\nsmall mistake.

The fact is important<br />\nfor two reasons: as a graduate<br />\nwoman, I cannot belong to the<br />\nWomen's Center, nor does any<br />\ncommon group exist for<br />\ngraduates, undergraduates,<br />\nfaculty, and JHU employees interested in women's issues. This<br />\nis precisely one of the problems<br />\nthe ad-hoc committee wishes to<br />\naddress. Secondly, the activities<br />\nof the ad-hoc committee and its<br /><br />\nassembly have been consistently depicted as those of only the<br />\nWomen's Center. As my<br />\npresiding over the assembly, the<br />\npresence of 250 other people<br />\nthere, and an almost equal<br />\nbalance of males and females at<br />\nour Saturday informational rally suggest, the group and its<br />\nsupporters come from many<br />\nareas of the university<br />\nIn the interest of a fair account, I must also respond to<br />\nJennifer Kidd's editorial. The<br />\nman she cites as being told to<br />\nsit down because ours was a<br />\ndemocratic meeting was refusing to yield the floor after<br />\nspeaking well over the allotted<br />\ntime for speakers. Secondly,<br />\nMs. Kidd was not told to get<br />\nraped near Mudd Hall. She was<br />\nurged to be careful near Mudd,<br />\nwhere the last campus rape<br />\ntook place, because she expressed an alarming sense of in-<br /><br />\nvulnerability to campus<br />\nviolence. She had asserted that<br />\nsince Hopkins women \"know<br />\nwhere they are going\" in successful careers, the pornography and violence issues<br />\ndidn't concern her personally.<br />\nFinally, Ms. Kidd's perception that rape and sexual<br />\nharassment are unconnected<br />\nphenomena illustrates the profound misunderstanding of<br />\nsexual-social issues in the<br />\nHopkins community that has<br />\nmoved our group to action.<br />\nMany, many people have expressed willingness to support a<br />\nbetter policy and a greater commitment to women's issues al<br />\nJHU.

Did they really expect to gain anyone's support<br />\nby their tactless (distributing<br />\nthe TEP letter and the rally) activities? There are far more pertinent concerns for the<br />\nWomen's Center to address,<br />\nsome of which I have supported. Yet the Women's<br />\nCenter has not been active in<br />\nthese. Instead, they went on a<br />\nmilitant propaganda blitz.<br />\nWhat is more difficult to<br />\nbelieve is that the Deans<br />\nrewarded this behavior by<br />\nsuspending TEP's social<br />\nprivileges and remaining ambivalent toward the Women's<br />\nCenter's own impropriety. Certainly if TEP is going to be held<br />\nresponsible for an internal<br />\nnewsletter, the center should be<br />\nheld responsible for its distribution. The administration has a<br />\npattern of being heavy-handed<br />\non the frats and social groups,<br />\nbut light on others. Who<br />\nremembers when the PSU invited the PLO,complete with a<br />\n\"security\" force, to campus.<br />\nDid they hold the PSU responsible for the assault and battery<br />\nof Hopkins students by PLO<br />\nsecurity, or for even inviting<br />\nthem here?

The next song,<br />\n\"Reign Of Blows (Vote No<br />\nViolence),\" ranks up there with<br />\nthe most political songs XTC<br />\nhas ever produced:\"By the half<br />\nlight of burning republics/ Joe<br />\nStalin looks just like Uncle<br />\nSam.\" This song is also interesting in that it is stylistically almost a parady of<br />\nmainstream American rock<br />\nwith its heavy chords and \"harmonic\" choruses.<br />\nThe next two songs, \"You're<br />\nThe Wish You Are I Had\" and<br />\n\"I<br />\nMoulding's<br />\nColin<br />\nRemember The Sun\" are probably the best pure songs on the<br />\nalbum. They are the proof that<br />\nsolid song writing is the base<br />\nunderneath the music and production. In fact,\"I Remember<br />\nThe Sun\" is a song worthy of<br />\nbeing placed in the Thirties and<br />\nForties\u2014the peak of pop song<br />\nwriting.<br />\nProbably the most interesting<br />\nsong on the album is the vaguely autobiographical \"Train<br />\nRunning Slow on Soul Coal.\"<br />\nOn the one hand, it's very<br />\nBritish\u2014to Americans, trains,<br />\nespecially coal powered ones,<br />\nare associated with the old<br /><br />\nWest. There just aren't many<br />\n\"train-spotters\" in suburban,<br />\nmiddle class America. On the<br />\nother hand, it is a continuation<br />\nof the XTC tradition of ending<br />\nan album with a down-beat<br />\nsong. It's a song that reflects<br />\nMr. Partridge's growing disenchantment with the music in:<br />\ndustry and his own doubts<br />\nabout the state of his<br />\nabilities\u2014\"I'm a thirty-year old<br />\npuppy doing what I'm told/<br />\nand I'm told there's no more<br />\ncoal for the older engines.\"<br />\n\"He's just a nut and he's<br />\ncracking,\" an obvious<br />\nreference to the doubts critics<br />\nhad about the state of his mental health after his stage fright<br />\ngot so bad that XTC had to<br />\nstop touring.<br />\nThe self-doubts are not warranted on the basis of this<br />\nalbum. There is still a whole lot<br />\nof \"soul coal\" left in Mr. Partridge and XTC in general. The<br />\nBig Express is XTC's Sgt. Pepper, quite an accomplishment.<br />\nYet, Sgt.

Ijust got<br />\nmy first 'A' on a paper, and<br />\nthis guy I like notices me. . .<br />\nI'm ready to burst, but my<br />\nroommate is out studying, and<br />\nno one is around on the hall. I<br />\nguess I just need someone to<br />\ntalk to .<br />\nSo began the final role play<br />\nof last week's peer-counseling<br />\ntraining session. It was a pleasant departure from the heavier<br />\ntopics brooched in earlier role<br />\nplays of the evening, yet it reinforced my observation: the<br />\nsizable workload of many<br />\nHopkins students, and the<br />\nlimitations of our community,<br />\nin part a result of off-campus<br />\nliving which often make us inaccessible to each other. We<br />\nhave a need here, for A Place<br />\nto Talk.<br />\n\"The group is bound by a<br />\ncommon sentiment that<br />\nHopkins fosters an attitude of<br />\nnon-involvement. In response<br />\nto this lack of community, they<br />\nproject themselves as a listening<br />\nforum,\" noted Clare King,<br />\nM.S.W. of the White House.<br />\nKing had been a supporter of<br />\npeer-counseling when the concept was introduced three years<br />\nHopkins<br />\na<br />\nby<br />\nago<br />\nundergraduate, and she led the<br />\ngroup through training this<br />\nsemester.<br />\nAdded Mike Purtell, who has<br />\nmobilized the group over the<br />\npast two semesters, \"We are<br />\nhere to help ease other students<br />\nthrough rough times, as well as<br />\nto reinforce the good. At times,<br />\na person simply needs an objective ear. We are trained<br />\nlisteners.\"<br />\nMimi Bianchi had known of<br />\nthe success other universities<br />\nhad with peer-counseling, and<br />\nthought Hopkins could benefit<br />\nfrom such an outreach program. She began corresponding<br />\nwith organizers of Harvard's<br />\nRoom Thirteen, the program<br />\nafter which A Place to Talk is<br />\nmodeled. This effort set the<br />\nwheels in motion.<br />\nLast semester the idea was introduced to the Hopkins community. A core of fifteen to<br />\nthirty students attended regular<br />\nmeetings, at which the structure<br />\nand direction of the program<br />\nwere mapped. Purtell cited<br />\nMargo McFarland, Deborah<br />\nNadelman, John Pedorolla,<br />\nand Rene Robinson for their input through this important<br />\nphase.<br />\nPurtell also mentioned that<br />\nwhile he spent much of the<br />\nsummer actively pursuing funds<br />\nfor the program, he was<br />\nnonetheless concerned that last<br />\nsemester's enthusiasm would<br />\ndissipate as academic demands<br />\nresumed this fall. This was not<br />\nthe case. Although new faces<br />\nhave replaced some, thirty<br />\nstudents from all four classes,<br />\nhave participated in this<br />\nsemester's training.<br />\nThe five weeks of rigorous<br /><br />\ntraining, completed this week,<br />\nemphasized the listening and<br />\ntechniques<br />\nquestioning<br />\nnecessary for effective peercounseling. Sessions were also<br />\npunctuated by the exchanges of<br />\nideas and concerns of these<br />\nfuture listening-counselors.<br />\nKing, pleased with the group's<br />\nprogress, commented, \"The<br />\nstudents in the group are<br />\nremarkably good and responsive listeners.\"<br />\nA Place to Talk, currently<br />\nbased in a room under Baker<br />\nHouse in AMR II, makes its<br />\ndebut on November 1.

Kuduk<br />\nThe National Football League's<br />\nsideline clothing style may have<br />\ntaken a turn for the worse this<br />\nweek. White shoes, white<br />\npants, designer hats are no<br />\nlonger in vogue, as John<br />\nMcKay orthe Tampa Bay Buccaneers announced his resignation, effective at the end of this<br />\nseason. The only head coach<br />\nwho looked as if he had just<br />\nwalked off the golf course every<br />\nweek cited health reasons for<br />\nhis resignation.<br />\nJohn McKay was one of the<br />\nmost successful NCAA coaches<br />\nin history. In the early seventies, USC was an institution<br />\nsynonymous with the Rose<br />\nBowl and football excellence.<br />\nThe Trojans captured nine<br />\nPac-8 championships under<br />\nMcKay in 16 seasons, graduating such NFL greats as<br />\n0. J. Simpson, Sam Cunningham, and Lynn Swann. But<br /><br />\nafter racking up a 121-37-8<br />\nrecord, John McKay decided to<br />\ntake up the greatest challenge<br />\nany head coach has to face.<br />\nIn the bicentennial year of<br />\ntheir inception, 1976, the Tampa Bay Buccaneers were synonymous with futility, losing all<br />\n14 games that season. The Bucs<br />\nfollowed in 1977 with 12 more<br />\nlosses, before rewarding coach<br />\nMcKay's patience with 2<br />\nstraight wins.

Without either a<br />\nquarterback or a placekicker<br />\n(Bill Capece is now unemployed), the offense went<br />\nbackwards, the defense became<br /><br />\noverworked (pay attention,<br />\nGiants fans!), and a poor<br />\nseason resulted.<br />\nJohn McKay has laid a solid<br />\nfoundation for his successor at<br />\nTampa Bay.

With only the<br />\nsweet Homewood air between<br />\nhim and the goal, Johnson<br />\nshanked the ball and hit the<br />\npost, failing to cash in on his<br />\nteam's best scoring opportunity of the night.<br />\nThis was a big break for<br />\nHopkins, but as Giuriceo put it,<br />\n\"We're making our own<br />\nbreaks.

The lack of<br />\nfunds relative to the number of<br />\nparticipants (70 on the men's<br />\nand women's teams together)<br />\nhas caused numerous problems.<br />\n\"I need more coaches,\" explained Head Coach Doug<br />\nSargeant. \"I have three crews<br />\nto coach, so I have to resort to<br />\ndoing drills; I just can't pay individual attention as much as<br />\nI'd like. I usually end up<br />\nscreaming myself hoarse.\"<br />\nSargeant says he would like to<br />\nsee at least one coach for each<br />\ncrew.<br />\nThe crew's youth and corresponding lack of funds also<br />\ncreates other problems. In<br />\norder to give attention to the<br />\nhuge number of novices,<br />\nSargeant claims he needs a rowing barge (a stationary boat<br />\nsimulation), which would both<br />\nimprove technique and enable<br />\nSargeant to more easily discern<br /><br />\nand correct mistakes.<br />\nThe main problem, however,<br />\nis an overabundance of people<br />\nand only four boats. What<br />\nresults is a teaming up of experienced rowers with novices<br />\nin the same shell and a limiting<br />\nof practice time available to the<br />\nveterans. However, Sargeant<br />\nrefuses to cut any fall participants to allow for more concentrated attention. He states<br />\nbluntly, \"Having so many people certainly causes problems.<br />\nBut it's worth it. Sure it<br />\nsometines screws up the experienced people, but [having<br />\nveterans and novices row<br />\ntogether] is the fairest way to do<br />\nit, so we can develop everyone<br />\nequally.\"<br />\nRozan<br />\nelaborates,<br />\n\"Everyone's got to make<br />\nsacrifices for everyone. We<br />\ncan't kick out the novices,<br />\nbecause they're the future of<br />\nHopkins' crews, and everyone<br />\nknows that. If the novices do<br />\nwell, the program should take<br />\noff in the future.\" Being one of<br />\nthe veterans \"sacrificed,\"<br />\nRozan adds that frystration is<br />\ninevitable but must be taken in<br />\nstride.<br />\n\"I was the coxswain at<br />\nGeorgetown and it was the best<br />\nthing I ever did in my life,\" explained Sargeant.\"Now I want<br />\nto teach as many other people<br />\nto do it as possible. It's very<br />\nfulfilling to see these kids<br />\ndevelop; some real klutzes can<br />\ndevelop into fine athletes.<br />\n\"Crew can be like a religious<br />\nexperience. You learn to go<br />\nbeyond yourself; it's an antiego thing. You're in the boat<br />\nwith eight other people and the<br />\nboat is only as fast as the<br />\nweakest link. There are no<br />\nheroes\u2014you rise and fall as a<br />\nteam. It's really worth teaching<br />\nthose values to other people,\"<br />\nhe said.<br />\nThese values are indeed<br />\nshared by the crew team<br />\nmembers. Pam Cort, a coxswaine, claims that \"crew is the<br />\nmost integrated team sport. It's<br />\na great feeling because all nine<br />\nof you are one person.\"<br />\nWith the exhilaration,<br /><br />\nOffering<br />\nStudent<br />\nDiscounts<br />\nWith<br />\nI.D.<br />\nHAIR STUDIO<br /><br />\nhowever, comes a lot of hard<br />\nnext to<br />\nwork. Said Rozan,\"The whole<br />\nwolman hall<br />\nthing teaches traditional values<br />\nand discipline. To get up at 5:30<br />\n(crew practices are at 6:00 AM)<br />\nOPEN FOR YOU -138-1126<br />\n3333 N CHARLES STREET<br />\ntakes some discipline. You have<br />\nPAUL R181<br />\nto budget your time.

Learning<br />\ncrew has been more than a<br />\nphysical expereince, but also an<br />\nemotional experience.
