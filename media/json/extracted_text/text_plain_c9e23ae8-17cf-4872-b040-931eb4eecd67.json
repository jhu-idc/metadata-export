The fore, it is quite natural that the<br />\nmechanism of the backfield was<br />\ngreatly impaired. Much credit is<br />\ndue Randall, whose punts at all<br />\ntimes were equal, and frequently<br />\ngreater, than those made by the<br />\nStevens' backs.<br />\nIn the early part of the first<br />\nquarter, neither side was able to<br />\ngain much ground. Hopkins was<br />\nheld for downs, then Stevens failed<br />\nto make ten yards. Stevens kicked<br />\nto Gillett, who was injured in the<br />\nnext play, and, whose place was<br />\ntaken by Bagley. Tappan made<br />\ntwelve yards around left end and<br />\non the next play made a pass to<br />\nBranham who dodged the Stevens<br />\nsecondary defense and put the ball<br />\nover the line for the first touchdown of the season.<br />\nThis lead of six points was maintained until the last quarter. At the<br />\nbeginning of this quarter Hopkins<br />\nlost the ball to Stevens on the latter's seven-yard line by not being<br />\nable to make first down. After an<br />\nexchange of punts, in which Hopldns had the advantage, play resumed on Stevens' forty-yard line,<br />\nwith Hopkins in possession of the<br />\nball. Branham lost ten yards on<br />\naccount of a poor pass. On the<br />\nnext play, a forward pass to right<br />\nend, the ball was intercepted by<br />\nBurnham(Stevens), who ran eightyfive yards for a touchdown, making<br />\nthe score 7 to 6.<br />\nBranham at all times played a<br />\nsplendid game, both at attack and<br />\ndefense. Especial credit is due to<br />\n\"Ben\" Tappan, who time and again<br />\npulled off runs for substantial gains<br />\nand at all times used his head.<br />\nCAPTAIN GEORGE M.

In this<br />\nproposal the novel suggestion is advanced that all three of the debates<br />\nbe held on neutral ground; in other<br />\nwords, that Hopkins debate Virginia at North Carolina and North<br />\nCarolina at Virginia, and that the<br />\nVirginia - North Carolina contest<br />\ntake place in Baltimore. This arrangement will undoubtedly meet<br />\nwith the approval of all three institutions.<br />\nIt is hoped that an agreement can<br />\nbe reached restricting the membership of the teams to men who have<br />\nnot yet received a degree. Both Virginia and North Carolina have large<br />\nprofessional schools, and such an<br />\nagreement would not disqualify the<br />\nmembers of these schools who have<br />\nnot had a collegiate course. If the<br />\nagreement cannot be reached, however, and graduate students should<br />\nbe eligible, there are a number of<br />\nmen in our graduate department<br />\nwho are trained debaters and whose<br />\nservices would add tremendous<br />\nstrength to the teams.<br />\n<br />\n221 W.

The laboratories are located<br />\nfour miles from the playing field,<br />\nand the men after working until<br />\nfive o'clock in the one, have a fortyfive minute car ride ahead of them<br />\n-before they can reach the other.<br />\nThey come onto the field fatigued<br />\nand after the sun has gone down,<br />\nand as a consequence, are unable<br />\nto practice with the snap and vigor<br />\nwhich makes practice really worth<br />\nwhile.<br />\nIt must be remembered, moreover, that a large part of the team<br />\nthis year happens to be made up<br />\nof new men. A great number of<br />\nplayers who were for years the<br />\nmainstay of Hopkins football<br />\ndropped out at the close of last<br />\nseason. Their successors will in<br />\nall probability turn out to be just<br />\nas efficient men in the long run, but<br />\nat present they are more or less<br />\nraw.<br />\nThe third disadvantage we are<br />\nup against this year is the schedule. The wonderfully successful<br />\nteams of the last three years have<br />\nlifted Hopkins into a class of colleges which our present inexperienced team is as yet unable to<br />\nhandle. As it is, the showing made<br />\nagainst the Navy was little short<br />\nof miraculous. No one could expect that it would be kept up. The<br />\ndefeat of the team by the heavy<br />\nelevens of Franklin and Marshall<br />\nand of Swarthmore was no more<br />\nthan could have been looked for.<br />\nThe critical games of the season\u2014those against Western Maryland and St. John's\u2014are ahead of<br />\nus.

The fore, it is quite natural that the<br />\nmechanism of the backfield was<br />\ngreatly impaired. Much credit is<br />\ndue Randall, whose punts at all<br />\ntimes were equal, and frequently<br />\ngreater, than those made by the<br />\nStevens' backs.<br />\nIn the early part of the first<br />\nquarter, neither side was able to<br />\ngain much ground. Hopkins was<br />\nheld for downs, then Stevens failed<br />\nto make ten yards. Stevens kicked<br />\nto Gillett, who was injured in the<br />\nnext play, and, whose place was<br />\ntaken by Bagley. Tappan made<br />\ntwelve yards around left end and<br />\non the next play made a pass to<br />\nBranham who dodged the Stevens<br />\nsecondary defense and put the ball<br />\nover the line for the first touchdown of the season.<br />\nThis lead of six points was maintained until the last quarter. At the<br />\nbeginning of this quarter Hopkins<br />\nlost the ball to Stevens on the latter's seven-yard line by not being<br />\nable to make first down. After an<br />\nexchange of punts, in which Hopldns had the advantage, play resumed on Stevens' forty-yard line,<br />\nwith Hopkins in possession of the<br />\nball. Branham lost ten yards on<br />\naccount of a poor pass. On the<br />\nnext play, a forward pass to right<br />\nend, the ball was intercepted by<br />\nBurnham(Stevens), who ran eightyfive yards for a touchdown, making<br />\nthe score 7 to 6.<br />\nBranham at all times played a<br />\nsplendid game, both at attack and<br />\ndefense.

A triangular league has been formed between<br />\nHopkins, the University of Virginia<br />\nand the University of North Carolina, and negotiations are now going on for the settlement of details.<br />\nBoth Virginia and North Carolina<br />\ndevote considerable attention to debating, and it is expected that they<br />\nwill prove rivals well able to test<br />\nthe mettle of any team that Hopkins can put into the field.<br />\nA tentative proposal of terms has<br />\nbeen submitted to North Carolina<br />\nand Hopkins by Virginia. In this<br />\nproposal the novel suggestion is advanced that all three of the debates<br />\nbe held on neutral ground; in other<br />\nwords, that Hopkins debate Virginia at North Carolina and North<br />\nCarolina at Virginia, and that the<br />\nVirginia - North Carolina contest<br />\ntake place in Baltimore.

Both Virginia and North Carolina have large<br />\nprofessional schools, and such an<br />\nagreement would not disqualify the<br />\nmembers of these schools who have<br />\nnot had a collegiate course. If the<br />\nagreement cannot be reached, however, and graduate students should<br />\nbe eligible, there are a number of<br />\nmen in our graduate department<br />\nwho are trained debaters and whose<br />\nservices would add tremendous<br />\nstrength to the teams.<br /><br />\n221 W.

The laboratories are located<br />\nfour miles from the playing field,<br />\nand the men after working until<br />\nfive o'clock in the one, have a fortyfive minute car ride ahead of them<br />\n-before they can reach the other.<br />\nThey come onto the field fatigued<br />\nand after the sun has gone down,<br />\nand as a consequence, are unable<br />\nto practice with the snap and vigor<br />\nwhich makes practice really worth<br />\nwhile.<br />\nIt must be remembered, moreover, that a large part of the team<br />\nthis year happens to be made up<br />\nof new men. A great number of<br />\nplayers who were for years the<br />\nmainstay of Hopkins football<br />\ndropped out at the close of last<br />\nseason. Their successors will in<br />\nall probability turn out to be just<br />\nas efficient men in the long run, but<br />\nat present they are more or less<br />\nraw.<br />\nThe third disadvantage we are<br />\nup against this year is the schedule. The wonderfully successful<br />\nteams of the last three years have<br />\nlifted Hopkins into a class of colleges which our present inexperienced team is as yet unable to<br />\nhandle. As it is, the showing made<br />\nagainst the Navy was little short<br />\nof miraculous. No one could expect that it would be kept up. The<br />\ndefeat of the team by the heavy<br />\nelevens of Franklin and Marshall<br />\nand of Swarthmore was no more<br />\nthan could have been looked for.<br />\nThe critical games of the season\u2014those against Western Maryland and St. John's\u2014are ahead of<br />\nus.

The painful injury received by<br />\nCaptain Gillett in last Saturday's<br />\ngame is a matter of regret to the<br />\nentire University. Entirely apart<br />\nfrom the effect which it will have<br />\nupon the team, we are all sorry<br />\nfor \u2022the accident for Gillie's own<br />\nsake. Whenever a man receives an<br />\ninjury while fighting in the common cause, there is something<br />\nnoble in the spectacle; and the man<br />\nhimself deserves so much the more<br />\nof sympathy and admiration. Gillie<br />\nwas hurt in Hopkins' cause, and<br />\nHopkins men should appreciate his<br />\nsacrifice accordingly. I fe has given<br />\nthe full measure of his time and<br />\nenergy to University athletics in<br />\nthe past; he now adds the full<br />\nmeasure of pain and suffering.
