This would include Iowa, Nebraska, Missouri, Kansas, Arkansas, Texas, and Oklahoma.<br />\nTo my knowledge there are over seventy alumni and ex-students of the<br />\nJohns Hopkins University within this territory engaged in professional work.<br />\nOf these I find seven in the University of Kansas, eight in the University of<br />\nMissouri, five in the University of Arkansas, three in the University of Iowa,<br />\nand seven in the University of Nebraska. The remainder are scattered in the<br />\nvarious universities and colleges of the Southwest.<br />\nI need not say to you that this large body of men, going forth well equipped with Johns Hopkins instruction and methods, and moreover partaking of<br />\nthe Johns Hopkins spirit of making the truth subservient to the good of<br />\nhumanity, has great influence on the educational work in their respective<br />\ninstitutions.<br />\nCompared with Eastern institutions of greater age or more wealthy foundations the Western institutions are lacking in equipment. Also, notwithstanding<br />\nthe progressive spirit of the West, there is always a lack in the organized support of higher culture and learning. In the making of the West, so-called<br />\npractical ideas predominate, and there is a tendency to make education immediately serviceable to material prosperity; and hence, the educational spirit<br />\nWhich surrounds the Western institution varies somewhat from that surrounding an Eastern institution where culture has been the predominant feature.<br />\nThe Johns Hopkins men have found it necessary to adapt themselves to<br />\ncircumstances, and while they love the truth for the truth's sake, their greater<br />\nwork has been the adaptation of this truth to the uplifting of humanity and the<br />\neducation of the people in right thinking. Perhaps every university man is, in<br />\none sense, a missionary of the truth, and this seems more apparent in the West<br />\nthan in the East. The University man in the West is supposed to know almost<br />\neverything, and is called upon to lecture on all sorts of subjects pertaining to<br />\nthe political, social, economic, or scientific life of the people. Under such cirIn<br />\n<br />\n\f2<br />\n<br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\n<br />\ncumstances special investigation and profound research are difficult, and, in<br />\nmost cases, I may say, impossible. Libraries are small; the hours of school<br />\nservice in the university are long; the requirements for outside lectures are<br />\ngreat, so that while a Western professor may be able to do some fairly good<br />\nwork in his attempt to add to the \"sum of human knowledge,\" his chief work<br />\nis that of instructor both within and without the university.<br />\nThe great West is absorbing. In the attempt to develop its resources millions of capital are taken up, much of it never to be returned. It is so in educational affairs. The university and the community demand the professor's<br />\ntime, his ideas, indeed, his whole life. They take all he has to give just as a<br />\nsponge takes water, except that they never reach a point of saturation. I have<br />\nthis therefore to say of the Johns Hopkins men in the West, that, while probably few of them will put on record any great literary or scientific achievements,<br />\ntheir services will be best noted in the general improvement of the communitks<br />\nin which they live and the advancement of the educational institution to which<br />\nthey are attached.<br />\nUnder such circumstances it would be impossible to make any definite<br />\nestimate of their services in the cause of education or their influences upon<br />\nhumanity, for much that they do will be shown in the higher educational ideals<br />\nand a better social and political life of the community, to be revealed more<br />\nespecially in the future than in the present, a general good which is traced to<br />\nno one in particular.<br />\nAs it is, the professor in wealthy Eastern institutions, called upon for a<br />\nfew lectures each week, surrounded by magnificent libraries and finely equipped<br />\nlaboratories, with comfortable salaries, in close touch with learned societies and<br />\neasy access of European learning, may establish lines of culture, write learned<br />\nbooks giving forth new discoveries; but the Western professor must be content<br />\nto serve his community though it absorbs his very life, counting it fortunate to<br />\nread the results of the research of his more favored brethren in the East, and<br />\nconscious that his services are exhibited in the youth he h As helped forward and<br />\nthe community he has served.<br />\n<br />\nFRANK W. BLACKMAR,<br />\nEx-President Johns Hopkins Club of the Middle West.<br />\n<br />\nTHE QUARTER-CENTENNIAL CELEBRATION.<br />\nORK is being actively pushed for the two days exercises on February 2122, which are to commemorate the twenty-fifth anniversary of the opening of work at the Hopkins, and which will also formally inaugurate<br />\nPresident Remsen. Dr, Gilman, President Emeritus of the University, will have<br />\ncharge on the first day, and will deliver an address, to be followed by responses<br />\nfrom visiting delegates. On the second day, President Remsen will be inaugurated, and will take charge of the ceremonies, which are to include the conferring of honorary degrees. This is quite a departure from the traditional policy<br />\n<br />\nv<br />\n<br />\n\fTHE NEWS\u2014LETTER.<br />\n<br />\n3<br />\n<br />\nof the University. On one other occasion only\u2014in 1879\u2014have honorary Hopkins degrees been conferred.<br />\nThe general committee of arrangements is as follows: Former President<br />\nD. C. Gilman, chairman; President Ira Remsen; Professor Gildersleeve, of the<br />\nGreek department; Professor Osler, of the department of medicine; Professor<br />\nWelch, of the department of pathology; professor Elliott, of the department of<br />\nRomance Languages; Professor Clark, of the department of geology; Professor<br />\nHaupt, of the department of Oriental languages; Dean Griffin, head of the department of philosophy; and Professor Ames, of the department of physics.<br />\nFor the purpose of expediting the work, this general committee is organized<br />\ninto sub-committees, as follows: Executive Committee, President Remsen,<br />\nchairman, Dr. Ames, Dr. Griffin; Music Committee, Dr. Haupt, chairman, Dr.<br />\nGilman, Dr. Remsen, ex officio; Committee of Arrangements, Dr. Clark, chairman, Dr. Elliott, Dr. Remsen, ex officio. This last committee is to arrange all<br />\ndetails relating to guests, delegates, program, etc. The Executive Committee<br />\nis very busy getting out the invitations, which will be issued this week, to<br />\nprominent men in the city and country at large.<br />\nIt is felt that this occasion will mark an epoch and a change in the history<br />\nof the University, and the ceremonies promise to be most noteworthy and impressive.<br />\nTHE CENTURY ESSAY.<br />\nT is very gratifying to every one connected with the University to know that<br />\nthe prize essay in the Century's competition for college graduates of 1900<br />\nhas been won by Mr. James Edward Routh, who took his bachelor's<br />\nof<br />\ndegree here year before last. The essay is published in the January number<br />\nLita<br />\nas<br />\n\"Huxley<br />\nof<br />\nestimate<br />\ncomprehensive<br />\nthe Century, and is an able and<br />\nerary Man.\" The press and the various weeklies have given very flattering<br />\nnotices of Mr. Routh's article, and the \"Review of Reviews,\" respecting the<br />\nessay, says: \"Mr. Routh makes the point that Huxley's great significance was<br />\nnot in the propounding of new doctrines, nor in the popularizing of science, but<br />\nin the power which enabled him to construct workable theories of life and ethics<br />\nout of loose truths.\"<br />\nIt is in just this way that graduates can best show their love for Hopkins,<br />\nand the only way in which they can actually serve her\u2014by doing something<br />\nthat will attract the notice of the public and bring the University before the<br />\ncountry at large. The result of a number of successes like this Mr. Routh has<br />\nachieved, which tend to wake people up to the fact that Hopkins is a live institution, and that things worth while are being done there, is incalculable.<br />\n<br />\n5<br />\n<br />\nOHN ERSKINE, Columbia, has won the Century Magazine prize for the<br />\nbest poem offered by a college graduate of the year 1900. His poem is<br />\nan idyl, entitled \"Acteon.\"<br />\n<br />\n3<br />\n<br />\n\fTHE NEWS\u2014LETTER.<br />\nTHE CHRISTMAS TRIP OF THE MUSICAL CLUBS.<br />\nN the dawn of December 26, the members of the Musical Clubs, rubbing<br />\ntheir eyes and joking about being up so early in the morning, left Camden<br />\nStation on a special car for West Virginia. Their first concert was given<br />\nthat night at Charlestown. While the whole programme was well appreciated,<br />\nthe banjo solo by V. B. Smith, and \"Dixie\" by the Glee Club, were most<br />\nloudly applauded. After the concert, the men were invited to several small entertainments given to them by some of the residents of the town.<br />\nWhen the clubs were on the point of leaving Charlestown the next morning,<br />\na great excitement arose. \"Where is Ham, Jr.?\" Sure enough the club's<br />\nmascot had suddenly disappeared. After considerable searching, he was found,<br />\nwith his mouth wide open with astonishment, gazing at the \"funny\" eggshaped heads of the local \"crowd.\"<br />\nThe second concert was at Winchester, which has always been noted for<br />\nthe kind reception that she gives Hopkins boys. This year, an audience, even<br />\nlarger than that of last year, turned out to hear them in the theatre of the new<br />\ntown hall, built by Charles Broadway Rouss. If the success of the concert could<br />\nbe measured by the applause, it was immense. The dance given to the club<br />\nafter the concert by the youth and beauty of Winchester was greatly enjoyed.<br />\nThe next morning the men hired vehicles, and took their lady friends out driving. But, alas, 2.10 came too soon, and the hard-hearted manager hurried them<br />\noff to Hagerstown. Many and touching were the good-byes on leaving Winchester, and the men all declared that it was the place where they wanted to go<br />\nwhen they died.<br />\n.<br />\nThis year, the clubs went from Winchester to Hagerstown by a different<br />\nand more rapid route, over the Cumberland Valley Railroad, through the beautiful Shenandoah Valley. At Hagerstown, the audience was small. Although<br />\nthis was on account of the rain, it is probable that the clubs will not return<br />\nthere for several years. After the concert, the last dance was given to the<br />\nclub; it was well arranged and very enjoyable.<br />\nThe programmes for all the concerts were creditably rendered. The Banjo<br />\nClub was undoubtedly the best. Its pieces, though few, were well chosen and<br />\nwell played. The Glee Club was a close second, though not because it had a<br />\nlarge number of pieces. The Mandolin Club did not seem to be up to the high<br />\nstandard of last year.<br />\nWhile the trip this year was greatly enjoyed it differed materially from<br />\nformer ones. Of the various \"clubs\" that sprung up and added to the general<br />\nenjoyment, the \"Goonay\" was the only survivor of last year. Then, too, the<br />\nmysterious flitting around of Andrew Reid Bird was greatly missed, although<br />\nhis place, as manager, was admirably filled by Robinson Cator Pagon,'03.<br />\nJ. C. H. '03.<br />\n<br />\n3<br />\n<br />\nThe Yale Glee and Banjo Clubs report for the last year total receipts of<br />\n$19,985.13, $16,933.53 of which were from concerts.<br />\n<br />\n\f5<br />\n<br />\nTHE NEWS\u2014LETTER.<br />\nTHE CONDITION OF THE CLUBS.<br />\n<br />\nORTY-ODD candidates for the musical clubs would seem to indicate no<br />\nlack of material, when it is remembered that not more than twenty-five<br />\nmen can be taken on the long trips, and yet there are places, waiting for<br />\ngood men, that it seems hard to fill, notably first tenors on the Glee Club, and<br />\nwind, wood, or brass, on the Mandolin Club, where a clarionet or horn would<br />\nhelp immensely. There is no need to urge the benefits to the University, in the<br />\nway of advertising, that come from musical clubs of a high standard and creditable performances. It is even less necessary to speak of the good times enjoyed by all the members on the excursions. An attractive program is pre<br />\nsented this year. Arrangements are being made for probable trips to Washington, Annapolis, and Bryn Mawr, while the Old Point schedule for Easter has<br />\nbeen completed.<br />\nThe clubs are to leave on the 28th of March, spend the 29th and 30th at<br />\nOld Point, and proceed on the 30th to Richmond, where a concert is being arranged by President A. R. Bird, '01. At Old Point the men will take meals at<br />\nthe Chamberlain, a concession not before granted, and there the principal concert and dance will be given.<br />\nInnocent Freshmen!

It gives the remarkable record of Hopkins men<br />\nin the educational development of the West, and at the same time a general<br />\nsurvey of the conditions for and against the westward progress of education.<br />\nDr. Frank W. Blackmar is a Johns Hopkins Ph.D., and is at present Professor<br />\nin the University of Kansas. Until recently Dr. Blackmar was President of the<br />\nJohns Hopkins Club of the Middle West. His communication, therefore, has<br />\nthe weight of study at close range.<br />\n<br />\nt<br />\n<br />\nINCE the last issue of the NEWS-LETTER a change has taken place on the<br />\nhoard of editors, and a new editor-in chief now assumes the responsibility of the office. Before proceeding farther we desire to congratulate Mr.<br />\nWilliam B. Hill on the successful manner in which he conducted the paper, and<br />\nto give a word of praise to the numerous improvements made during his incumbency as editor in chief. Mr. Hill has filled various positions on the board<br />\nsince his Freshman year, and has always been a faithful worker for the good of<br />\nthe paper. In our opinion the NEWS-LETTER under his regime made more<br />\nstrides toward the position it should hold at Hopkins than at any previous time<br />\nin its career. With such a broad field to cover, and with such limited resources<br />\nat hand, the attempt to edit a successful college paper at Hopkins is no sinecure,<br />\nand requires all the efforts of the editors, supported by the active encourage-<br />\n<br />\nA<br />\n<br />\n\fTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\n<br />\n7<br />\n<br />\nmeat of the student body. Without liberal encouragement the paper can never<br />\nhold its due position. Therefore in order to keep it to its standard we call on<br />\nthe student body and alumni for a continuance and increase of support, by contributions in the form of news items, original articles, poems, or short stories.<br />\n1,14 Juniors and Freshmen who have aspirations along literary lines should<br />\ntry for the position now vacant on the NEWS-LETTER staff. The advantages accruing from Nnws-LItTT4R work do not tend toward one<br />\nall<br />\nparticular sphere of activity, as the training derived will benefit men in<br />\nwho<br />\n,<br />\npursuing<br />\nnow<br />\nare<br />\nthey<br />\nwork<br />\nwhat<br />\nmatter<br />\nno<br />\nbranches of study. All men,<br />\ncan write and will work, should take advantage of this opportunity, and strive<br />\nfor the vacant editorship. Articles on news or athletic events, or original contributions should be handed in as soon as possible, as the election will take<br />\non<br />\nplace in a short time. All work done in this competition will be counted<br />\ncontests.<br />\nin<br />\nfuture<br />\nor<br />\nthe record of the competit<br />\n<br />\n4<br />\n<br />\nHOUGH there is apparently less athletic activity during the winter months<br />\nthan at any other season of the year, this time is really the most important for the development of successful teams. This is the time for hard<br />\ntraining and vigorous practice in gymnasium and cage, when talent is brought<br />\ntaking<br />\nforward and the structure of the team is formed. There are few games<br />\ngames<br />\nhard<br />\nplace now, but the quiet work in the cage is preparing men for the<br />\ns<br />\ncandidate<br />\nthat will follow one another later in the season. Now is the time for<br />\ntill<br />\nwait<br />\nto<br />\nto come out if they ever expect to make teams; they cannot afford<br />\nsome set<br />\nlacrosse practice starts at the park or till the track team is entered for<br />\nhad,<br />\never<br />\nhave<br />\nof games. The coming lacrosse season will be the hardest we<br />\n.<br />\nstandard<br />\nits<br />\nand it requires a great amount of work to keep the team up to<br />\na<br />\nonly<br />\nleft<br />\nThe track and field team has lost some of its best men, and has<br />\nphysismall nucleus on which to build. We therefore urge all men who are<br />\ntry to<br />\nand<br />\ncally able to do athletic work to go out now with one of the teams<br />\nper<br />\nninety<br />\nmake it.

The Johns Hopkins<br />\nUniversity will, on February 2122, stop its regular routine for a celebration of<br />\na quarter of a century's growth, which in methods and results has filled educators in Europe and America with wonder. The founding of the University<br />\nmarked an epoch in education in the United States, for methods entirely unknown on this side of the Atlantic were introduced into the Hopkins system of<br />\ninstruction. The exceedingly high standard of the great German universities<br />\nwere set as the goal for the Hopkins graduate departments, so that now the<br />\nreputation of the Hopkins degree of philosophy surpasses that of any American<br />\nUniversity, and equals the best in Europe. A recent account published in the<br />\ndaily papers of this country from an interview with a Yale graduate, stated<br />\nthat though Yale, old as she is, was seldom mentioned in European educational<br />\ncircles, the name of Johns Hopkins bore a magic charm; while in America any<br />\ngraduate from the \"phiolosophical machine\" of Hopkins, a name by which the<br />\nUniversity was once characterized, can secure a teaching position anywhere.<br />\nResults such as these, attained in so short a period as twenty-five years, are<br />\nsurely worthy of a great celebration, especially as this year we stand on the<br />\nthreshhold of a new era, and begin the second quarter under a new president<br />\nwhose inauguration occurs at the same time. It is true that owing to a remarkable lack of support, the dawn of the new era is not as bright as it should be;<br />\nyet it seems that it must almost be a result of a natural phenomenon for the<br />\nclouds to clear, for the alumni and friends of the University to recognize that<br />\nwhat it has done it can continue to do\u2014if nobly supported by those it has<br />\nreared, and by those to whom it has brought an untold wealth.<br />\n<br />\n\fTHE NEWS\u2014LETTER'<br />\n<br />\n9<br />\n<br />\nHaiffiniammounimourn rthipiimommoomunimummoimmuniumummummommumnumummithinummommunis<br />\n<br />\noievologoin11111111141111ivrIvroWilllivoliwolfilliglliliiillililirIPIIMIIIIN1111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111inillialltiglIffifillig1!g1:P:i4irsal;01<br />\n<br />\nACH member of the class of 1901 and 1902 has received an attractively<br />\nprinted copy of the baccalaureate sermon delivered by the Rev.

In<br />\nreference to the \"Carnegie Institute,\" in the incorporation of which Dr. Gilman<br />\nplayed so prominent a part, he said that it would be an institute for the advancement of knowledge, a place for undergraduate and graduate, American and foreigner, to develop knowledge along his own line of research.

Besides these, it is proposed to hold a series of indoor events in the cage, in which all who are interested in track and field sports<br />\nmay participate. Prizes will be given for first, second, third, and fourth places<br />\nin each separate event, besides which a larger prize will be offered to the one<br />\nmaking the best showing in the entire series.<br />\nTrack and Field work is hardly as interesting in the preliminary training as<br />\nlacrosse practice and that of other teams, so it is to be hoped that the large<br />\nbunch of runners who have come out up to date will keep their nerve and continue their hard and steady practice. It is only such practice that is productive of the best results.

This would include Iowa, Nebraska, Missouri, Kansas, Arkansas, Texas, and Oklahoma.<br />\nTo my knowledge there are over seventy alumni and ex-students of the<br />\nJohns Hopkins University within this territory engaged in professional work.<br />\nOf these I find seven in the University of Kansas, eight in the University of<br />\nMissouri, five in the University of Arkansas, three in the University of Iowa,<br />\nand seven in the University of Nebraska. The remainder are scattered in the<br />\nvarious universities and colleges of the Southwest.<br />\nI need not say to you that this large body of men, going forth well equipped with Johns Hopkins instruction and methods, and moreover partaking of<br />\nthe Johns Hopkins spirit of making the truth subservient to the good of<br />\nhumanity, has great influence on the educational work in their respective<br />\ninstitutions.<br />\nCompared with Eastern institutions of greater age or more wealthy foundations the Western institutions are lacking in equipment. Also, notwithstanding<br />\nthe progressive spirit of the West, there is always a lack in the organized support of higher culture and learning. In the making of the West, so-called<br />\npractical ideas predominate, and there is a tendency to make education immediately serviceable to material prosperity; and hence, the educational spirit<br />\nWhich surrounds the Western institution varies somewhat from that surrounding an Eastern institution where culture has been the predominant feature.<br />\nThe Johns Hopkins men have found it necessary to adapt themselves to<br />\ncircumstances, and while they love the truth for the truth's sake, their greater<br />\nwork has been the adaptation of this truth to the uplifting of humanity and the<br />\neducation of the people in right thinking. Perhaps every university man is, in<br />\none sense, a missionary of the truth, and this seems more apparent in the West<br />\nthan in the East. The University man in the West is supposed to know almost<br />\neverything, and is called upon to lecture on all sorts of subjects pertaining to<br />\nthe political, social, economic, or scientific life of the people. Under such cirIn<br /><br />\n2<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br /><br />\ncumstances special investigation and profound research are difficult, and, in<br />\nmost cases, I may say, impossible. Libraries are small; the hours of school<br />\nservice in the university are long; the requirements for outside lectures are<br />\ngreat, so that while a Western professor may be able to do some fairly good<br />\nwork in his attempt to add to the \"sum of human knowledge,\" his chief work<br />\nis that of instructor both within and without the university.<br />\nThe great West is absorbing. In the attempt to develop its resources millions of capital are taken up, much of it never to be returned. It is so in educational affairs. The university and the community demand the professor's<br />\ntime, his ideas, indeed, his whole life. They take all he has to give just as a<br />\nsponge takes water, except that they never reach a point of saturation. I have<br />\nthis therefore to say of the Johns Hopkins men in the West, that, while probably few of them will put on record any great literary or scientific achievements,<br />\ntheir services will be best noted in the general improvement of the communitks<br />\nin which they live and the advancement of the educational institution to which<br />\nthey are attached.<br />\nUnder such circumstances it would be impossible to make any definite<br />\nestimate of their services in the cause of education or their influences upon<br />\nhumanity, for much that they do will be shown in the higher educational ideals<br />\nand a better social and political life of the community, to be revealed more<br />\nespecially in the future than in the present, a general good which is traced to<br />\nno one in particular.<br />\nAs it is, the professor in wealthy Eastern institutions, called upon for a<br />\nfew lectures each week, surrounded by magnificent libraries and finely equipped<br />\nlaboratories, with comfortable salaries, in close touch with learned societies and<br />\neasy access of European learning, may establish lines of culture, write learned<br />\nbooks giving forth new discoveries; but the Western professor must be content<br />\nto serve his community though it absorbs his very life, counting it fortunate to<br />\nread the results of the research of his more favored brethren in the East, and<br />\nconscious that his services are exhibited in the youth he h As helped forward and<br />\nthe community he has served.<br /><br />\nFRANK W. BLACKMAR,<br />\nEx-President Johns Hopkins Club of the Middle West.<br /><br />\nTHE QUARTER-CENTENNIAL CELEBRATION.<br />\nORK is being actively pushed for the two days exercises on February 2122, which are to commemorate the twenty-fifth anniversary of the opening of work at the Hopkins, and which will also formally inaugurate<br />\nPresident Remsen. Dr, Gilman, President Emeritus of the University, will have<br />\ncharge on the first day, and will deliver an address, to be followed by responses<br />\nfrom visiting delegates. On the second day, President Remsen will be inaugurated, and will take charge of the ceremonies, which are to include the conferring of honorary degrees. This is quite a departure from the traditional policy<br /><br />\nv<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS\u2014LETTER.<br /><br />\n3<br /><br />\nof the University. On one other occasion only\u2014in 1879\u2014have honorary Hopkins degrees been conferred.<br />\nThe general committee of arrangements is as follows: Former President<br />\nD. C. Gilman, chairman; President Ira Remsen; Professor Gildersleeve, of the<br />\nGreek department; Professor Osler, of the department of medicine; Professor<br />\nWelch, of the department of pathology; professor Elliott, of the department of<br />\nRomance Languages; Professor Clark, of the department of geology; Professor<br />\nHaupt, of the department of Oriental languages; Dean Griffin, head of the department of philosophy; and Professor Ames, of the department of physics.<br />\nFor the purpose of expediting the work, this general committee is organized<br />\ninto sub-committees, as follows: Executive Committee, President Remsen,<br />\nchairman, Dr. Ames, Dr. Griffin; Music Committee, Dr. Haupt, chairman, Dr.<br />\nGilman, Dr. Remsen, ex officio; Committee of Arrangements, Dr. Clark, chairman, Dr. Elliott, Dr. Remsen, ex officio. This last committee is to arrange all<br />\ndetails relating to guests, delegates, program, etc. The Executive Committee<br />\nis very busy getting out the invitations, which will be issued this week, to<br />\nprominent men in the city and country at large.<br />\nIt is felt that this occasion will mark an epoch and a change in the history<br />\nof the University, and the ceremonies promise to be most noteworthy and impressive.<br />\nTHE CENTURY ESSAY.<br />\nT is very gratifying to every one connected with the University to know that<br />\nthe prize essay in the Century's competition for college graduates of 1900<br />\nhas been won by Mr. James Edward Routh, who took his bachelor's<br />\nof<br />\ndegree here year before last.

Their first concert was given<br />\nthat night at Charlestown. While the whole programme was well appreciated,<br />\nthe banjo solo by V. B. Smith, and \"Dixie\" by the Glee Club, were most<br />\nloudly applauded. After the concert, the men were invited to several small entertainments given to them by some of the residents of the town.<br />\nWhen the clubs were on the point of leaving Charlestown the next morning,<br />\na great excitement arose. \"Where is Ham, Jr.?\" Sure enough the club's<br />\nmascot had suddenly disappeared. After considerable searching, he was found,<br />\nwith his mouth wide open with astonishment, gazing at the \"funny\" eggshaped heads of the local \"crowd.\"<br />\nThe second concert was at Winchester, which has always been noted for<br />\nthe kind reception that she gives Hopkins boys. This year, an audience, even<br />\nlarger than that of last year, turned out to hear them in the theatre of the new<br />\ntown hall, built by Charles Broadway Rouss. If the success of the concert could<br />\nbe measured by the applause, it was immense. The dance given to the club<br />\nafter the concert by the youth and beauty of Winchester was greatly enjoyed.<br />\nThe next morning the men hired vehicles, and took their lady friends out driving. But, alas, 2.10 came too soon, and the hard-hearted manager hurried them<br />\noff to Hagerstown. Many and touching were the good-byes on leaving Winchester, and the men all declared that it was the place where they wanted to go<br />\nwhen they died.<br />\n.<br />\nThis year, the clubs went from Winchester to Hagerstown by a different<br />\nand more rapid route, over the Cumberland Valley Railroad, through the beautiful Shenandoah Valley. At Hagerstown, the audience was small. Although<br />\nthis was on account of the rain, it is probable that the clubs will not return<br />\nthere for several years. After the concert, the last dance was given to the<br />\nclub; it was well arranged and very enjoyable.<br />\nThe programmes for all the concerts were creditably rendered. The Banjo<br />\nClub was undoubtedly the best. Its pieces, though few, were well chosen and<br />\nwell played. The Glee Club was a close second, though not because it had a<br />\nlarge number of pieces. The Mandolin Club did not seem to be up to the high<br />\nstandard of last year.<br />\nWhile the trip this year was greatly enjoyed it differed materially from<br />\nformer ones. Of the various \"clubs\" that sprung up and added to the general<br />\nenjoyment, the \"Goonay\" was the only survivor of last year. Then, too, the<br />\nmysterious flitting around of Andrew Reid Bird was greatly missed, although<br />\nhis place, as manager, was admirably filled by Robinson Cator Pagon,'03.<br />\nJ. C. H. '03.<br /><br />\n3<br /><br />\nThe Yale Glee and Banjo Clubs report for the last year total receipts of<br />\n$19,985.13, $16,933.53 of which were from concerts.<br /><br />\n5<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS\u2014LETTER.<br />\nTHE CONDITION OF THE CLUBS.<br /><br />\nORTY-ODD candidates for the musical clubs would seem to indicate no<br />\nlack of material, when it is remembered that not more than twenty-five<br />\nmen can be taken on the long trips, and yet there are places, waiting for<br />\ngood men, that it seems hard to fill, notably first tenors on the Glee Club, and<br />\nwind, wood, or brass, on the Mandolin Club, where a clarionet or horn would<br />\nhelp immensely. There is no need to urge the benefits to the University, in the<br />\nway of advertising, that come from musical clubs of a high standard and creditable performances. It is even less necessary to speak of the good times enjoyed by all the members on the excursions. An attractive program is pre<br />\nsented this year. Arrangements are being made for probable trips to Washington, Annapolis, and Bryn Mawr, while the Old Point schedule for Easter has<br />\nbeen completed.<br />\nThe clubs are to leave on the 28th of March, spend the 29th and 30th at<br />\nOld Point, and proceed on the 30th to Richmond, where a concert is being arranged by President A.

Before proceeding farther we desire to congratulate Mr.<br />\nWilliam B. Hill on the successful manner in which he conducted the paper, and<br />\nto give a word of praise to the numerous improvements made during his incumbency as editor in chief. Mr. Hill has filled various positions on the board<br />\nsince his Freshman year, and has always been a faithful worker for the good of<br />\nthe paper. In our opinion the NEWS-LETTER under his regime made more<br />\nstrides toward the position it should hold at Hopkins than at any previous time<br />\nin its career. With such a broad field to cover, and with such limited resources<br />\nat hand, the attempt to edit a successful college paper at Hopkins is no sinecure,<br />\nand requires all the efforts of the editors, supported by the active encourage-<br /><br />\nA<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br /><br />\n7<br /><br />\nmeat of the student body. Without liberal encouragement the paper can never<br />\nhold its due position. Therefore in order to keep it to its standard we call on<br />\nthe student body and alumni for a continuance and increase of support, by contributions in the form of news items, original articles, poems, or short stories.<br />\n1,14 Juniors and Freshmen who have aspirations along literary lines should<br />\ntry for the position now vacant on the NEWS-LETTER staff. The advantages accruing from Nnws-LItTT4R work do not tend toward one<br />\nall<br />\nparticular sphere of activity, as the training derived will benefit men in<br />\nwho<br />\n,<br />\npursuing<br />\nnow<br />\nare<br />\nthey<br />\nwork<br />\nwhat<br />\nmatter<br />\nno<br />\nbranches of study. All men,<br />\ncan write and will work, should take advantage of this opportunity, and strive<br />\nfor the vacant editorship. Articles on news or athletic events, or original contributions should be handed in as soon as possible, as the election will take<br />\non<br />\nplace in a short time. All work done in this competition will be counted<br />\ncontests.<br />\nin<br />\nfuture<br />\nor<br />\nthe record of the competit<br /><br />\n4<br /><br />\nHOUGH there is apparently less athletic activity during the winter months<br />\nthan at any other season of the year, this time is really the most important for the development of successful teams. This is the time for hard<br />\ntraining and vigorous practice in gymnasium and cage, when talent is brought<br />\ntaking<br />\nforward and the structure of the team is formed. There are few games<br />\ngames<br />\nhard<br />\nplace now, but the quiet work in the cage is preparing men for the<br />\ns<br />\ncandidate<br />\nthat will follow one another later in the season. Now is the time for<br />\ntill<br />\nwait<br />\nto<br />\nto come out if they ever expect to make teams; they cannot afford<br />\nsome set<br />\nlacrosse practice starts at the park or till the track team is entered for<br />\nhad,<br />\never<br />\nhave<br />\nof games. The coming lacrosse season will be the hardest we<br />\n.<br />\nstandard<br />\nits<br />\nand it requires a great amount of work to keep the team up to<br />\na<br />\nonly<br />\nleft<br />\nThe track and field team has lost some of its best men, and has<br />\nphysismall nucleus on which to build. We therefore urge all men who are<br />\ntry to<br />\nand<br />\ncally able to do athletic work to go out now with one of the teams<br />\nper<br />\nninety<br />\nmake it.

Formerly it was one of the<br />\nthe<br />\nlaws of the so-called Hopkins spirit for seniors to be serious spectators of<br />\nthe<br />\nbeen<br />\nhave<br />\nshould<br />\nwho<br />\nseniors,<br />\nactions of juniors and freshmen, so that the<br />\non-lookpassive<br />\nthan<br />\nmore<br />\nmuch<br />\nnatural leaders in all college affairs, were not<br />\ners. At present it appears to be the senior spirit which dominates the Hopsuch<br />\nkins spirit, and the greatest field of activity is the graduating class. Just<br />\nsometo<br />\namount<br />\nwill<br />\nthat<br />\nthings are needed to build up a genuine college spirit<br />\nthing in later years, that will be a bond between the alumnus and his Alma<br />\nMater; for no matter how high the Academic standing of a college is, it cannot<br />\nhold the interest of its alumni except by pleasant recollections and associations,<br /><br />\nZ<br /><br />\n8<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br /><br />\nBy this we do not mean that fun is the only essential of a true college spirit,<br />\nbut it is the first from which all other demonstrations spring. It would be a<br />\ngood plan for 1903 and 1904 to follow the lead of the seniors in enlivening old<br />\nHopkins.<br />\nHE first twenty-five years in the growth of anything, be it man or institution, are always the most vital, the most fraught with dangers, and the<br />\nmost full of obstacles; and when these years are successfully passed<br />\nthere is always just cause for a halt and a retrospect. The Johns Hopkins<br />\nUniversity will, on February 2122, stop its regular routine for a celebration of<br />\na quarter of a century's growth, which in methods and results has filled educators in Europe and America with wonder. The founding of the University<br />\nmarked an epoch in education in the United States, for methods entirely unknown on this side of the Atlantic were introduced into the Hopkins system of<br />\ninstruction. The exceedingly high standard of the great German universities<br />\nwere set as the goal for the Hopkins graduate departments, so that now the<br />\nreputation of the Hopkins degree of philosophy surpasses that of any American<br />\nUniversity, and equals the best in Europe. A recent account published in the<br />\ndaily papers of this country from an interview with a Yale graduate, stated<br />\nthat though Yale, old as she is, was seldom mentioned in European educational<br />\ncircles, the name of Johns Hopkins bore a magic charm; while in America any<br />\ngraduate from the \"phiolosophical machine\" of Hopkins, a name by which the<br />\nUniversity was once characterized, can secure a teaching position anywhere.<br />\nResults such as these, attained in so short a period as twenty-five years, are<br />\nsurely worthy of a great celebration, especially as this year we stand on the<br />\nthreshhold of a new era, and begin the second quarter under a new president<br />\nwhose inauguration occurs at the same time. It is true that owing to a remarkable lack of support, the dawn of the new era is not as bright as it should be;<br />\nyet it seems that it must almost be a result of a natural phenomenon for the<br />\nclouds to clear, for the alumni and friends of the University to recognize that<br />\nwhat it has done it can continue to do\u2014if nobly supported by those it has<br />\nreared, and by those to whom it has brought an untold wealth.<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS\u2014LETTER'<br /><br />\n9<br /><br />\nHaiffiniammounimourn rthipiimommoomunimummoimmuniumummummommumnumummithinummommunis<br /><br />\noievologoin11111111141111ivrIvroWilllivoliwolfilliglliliiillililirIPIIMIIIIN1111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111inillialltiglIffifillig1!g1:P:i4irsal;01<br /><br />\nACH member of the class of 1901 and 1902 has received an attractively<br />\nprinted copy of the baccalaureate sermon delivered by the Rev.

Besides these, it is proposed to hold a series of indoor events in the cage, in which all who are interested in track and field sports<br />\nmay participate.

It is only such practice that is productive of the best results.

Even<br />\nthe freshmen knows about lacrosse, sir; or at least he thinks he does. It's<br />\ncalled lacrosse because it is a cross between tennis and hockey; and the language spoken is usually a cross between what one gentleman calls Balzac at<br />\nhis best and Chaucer at his worst. But he says that is only when a man gets<br />\nhit with the ball.<br />\n\"Me, sir? no, sir, I've never played it; I've too much sense, sir. But<br />\nthere are them that seem to like it. Why don't you know that there are just<br />\nlots of young gentlemen, nice boys, not toughs, who fail to pass in their studies, sir, just because they don't want to fail in passing a lacrosse ball. They<br />\ndon't mind being late to class a bit, sir. Just ask Mr. Greene, not the one at<br />\nthe post office, but the other one. Dr. Greene? That's it, sir, Dr. Greene.

You'd think that he was talking in words<br />\nof eight syllables, but he aint, sir. It just sounds that way because he talks in<br />\nbunches.<br />\n\"Am I getting it too short, sir? No indeed, I'll make it even. What<br />\nnext? They go into the cage and the old men show off so that the freshmen<br />\nwill he awed. It takes a lacrosse man to handle a freshman. All the Hopkins<br />\narrogance and pride for years seems to crop out in the lacrosse men; if they are<br />\nnot the whole show they at least think so.<br />\n\"If you can hit someone else without getting hit yourself that counts you<br />\none.<br />\n\"Then the young ladies, sir. They come down to see how the game is<br />\nplayed. 'What a pretty game?' she says. 'Yes, it's so open,' he says. 'Open<br />\nto improvement?' she says. `No,' says he disgusted like, 'open to the view.'<br />\n'Especially the costumes,' says she. 'Let's discuss Ibsen,' he says, and they<br />\ngo out.

If the patient listeners would<br />\nonly strive to overcome the possesser of the dreary monotone the fault might,<br />\nin time, be remedied. How much brighter would home become if we took care<br />\nto read correctly! Even papa would take a livelier interest in the reading of<br />\nthe stockmarket reports if only his silvery-tongued daughter would read the<br />\nrecords to him. In time a great improvement and growth would be seen in the<br />\nfamily (not in size hut in interest.) Little Johnnie would no longer take<br />\npleasure in reading about Diamond Dick in the woodshed; coming under the<br />\nbenign influence of the home reading circle he would gradually be elevated until he could read with pleasure, if not with profit, the Fables of George Ade, and<br />\nthe war poems of Rudyard Kipling.<br />\nDIRECTIONS: Grab the book, paper, or pamphlet, in the left hand, hold it<br />\nto the side, slightly below the face, and about eighteen inches from the head.<br />\nCast your eyes often upon the audience, but more often upon your book.
