Veterans told<br />\nme that it had been smoked too hard<br />\nfor a new pipe and should be put away.<br />\nThe pipe was laid away again. A<br />\nshort time ago I got it out and smoked<br />\none of the common brands of tobacco<br />\nin it. The results were disappointing.<br />\nI told the druggist of my experience<br />\nwith it. He asked if I had tried Edgeworth. I told him I never had. I followed his suggestion, and I am honest<br />\nwhen I say that it has restored the<br />\nsweetness to the pipe, and has made<br />\nme wonder. Was it the pipe or the<br />\nbrand of tobacco that caused me to<br />\nlay it away for the long period of time?<br />\nAs a novice, I prefer Edgeworth.

Last year's_honors<br />\nwent to Sigma Tau Delta, which had<br />\nan average of 7.73.<br />\nMany of the fraternities did not<br />\ncompete, either because they failed<br />\nto compile their averages, or found<br />\nthem of too low a grade to be placed<br />\nin the competition. The cup will be<br />\npresented as soon as the assessment<br />\nof two dollars is collected from all<br />\nthe Greek letter societies.<br />\nRushing Season Discussed<br /><br />\nAt the meeting of the Interfraternity Board last Thursday the subject of the length of rushing season<br />\nwas discussed to great length. The<br />\nplan of having the season last until<br />\nFebruary, as is the rule in many colleges, seems to have been forgotten<br />\naltogether. There are now three<br />\nplans before the board. These are a<br />\ntwo-week season, a four-week season, or a six-week season. The last<br />\nof the three was used last year. The<br />\nmen who support the lengthier season claim that it gives them time to<br />\nreally know the men; while those of<br />\nthe Greek societies who back the<br />\nplan for the shorter season claim<br />\nthey can learn to know the men just<br />\nas well and are able to cut down on<br />\nexpenses and time. Also they claim<br />\nthey are able to be of aid to the men<br />\nboth in studies and activities when<br />\nrushing is concluded at an early<br />\ndate.<br />\nBridge Tournament Failure<br /><br />\nThe annual bridge tournament has<br />\nbeen more or less of a failure.

If it should<br />\nrain on the day scheduled for the<br />\ngame, the contest will be played the<br />\nfollowing Saturday. The games are<br />\nbeing played in as short a space of<br />\ntime as possible because the senior<br />\nexams will begin around the fifteenth, and everyone is anxious for<br />\nthese men to participate.<br />\nThe schedule is as follows:<br />\nApril 30\u2014Sigma Tau Delta vs.<br />\nPhi Gamma Delta.<br />\nMay 1\u2014Kappa Sigma vs. Delta<br />\nGamma Theta.<br />\nMay 2\u2014Phi Kappa Psi vs. Kappa<br />\nAlpha.<br />\nMay 3\u2014Alpha Tau Omega vs.<br />\nAlpha Delta Phi.<br />\nMay 4\u2014Beta Theta Pi vs. Omicron Kappa Omicron.<br />\nMay 7\u2014Delta Phi vs. Alpha<br />\nKappa Phi.<br />\nMay 8\u2014Alpha Mu Tau vs. Buccaneers.<br />\nPi Kappa Chi drew a bye.<br /><br />\nHOMEWOOD, BALTIMORRE, MD., MAY 1, 1928<br /><br />\nHOPKINS RELAY TEAM<br />\nLOSES AT U-OF-PENN<br />\nJohns Hopkins'. mile relay<br />\nquartet was unplaced in the<br />\nlone event in which the Black<br />\nand Blue was represented at<br />\nthe Penn Relays.

The framers of the<br />\nConstitution believed that they were<br />\nacting for the country's benefit, and<br />\nit is manifestly unfair to accuse<br />\nthem of favoring its adoption merely<br />\nbecause they were large property<br />\nowners or opposing it because they<br />\nwere debtors.<br />\nIn review Mr. Warren concluded<br />\nby saying that the chief aim of the<br />\nframers of the Constitution was to<br />\n\"establish an adequate government<br />\nto maintain a federation capable of<br />\nholding its own both at home and<br />\nabroad.

I smoked it a great<br />\ndeal for two or three weeks, put it aside,<br />\nthen began smoking it again. This<br />\ntime it was very strong. Veterans told<br />\nme that it had been smoked too hard<br />\nfor a new pipe and should be put away.<br />\nThe pipe was laid away again. A<br />\nshort time ago I got it out and smoked<br />\none of the common brands of tobacco<br />\nin it. The results were disappointing.<br />\nI told the druggist of my experience<br />\nwith it. He asked if I had tried Edgeworth. I told him I never had. I followed his suggestion, and I am honest<br />\nwhen I say that it has restored the<br />\nsweetness to the pipe, and has made<br />\nme wonder. Was it the pipe or the<br />\nbrand of tobacco that caused me to<br />\nlay it away for the long period of time?<br />\nAs a novice, I prefer Edgeworth.
