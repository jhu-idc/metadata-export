On a scramble<br />\nnear the Maryland net, the ball was<br />\nin an undecided position until Gough,<br />\nplaying right inside for the Jays,<br />\ncharged through<br />\nwith a beautiful<br />\nboot which terminated in the Terrapin's net.<br />\nThe winning goal of the game was<br />\nscored in the extra period by Henderson, who played center full for University of Maryland. Henderson<br />\npicked a slow roller from a fellow<br />\nPlayer and booted it from close range<br />\ninto the Hopkins net.<br />\nEvery Blue Jay boater turned in a<br />\ngreat performance and Coach Dotterweich expressed his satisfaction with<br />\nhis team. \"We'll be right in there<br />\nnext year with a better and more<br />\nexperienced team.\"<br />\n<br />\nFraternity Sports<br />\n\u2022<br />\nThe last Saturday in January the<br />\nInterfrat Basketball and Volleyball<br />\nLeagues will be under way.

On a kick in by Beacham, left inside for University of<br />\nMaryland, Cissel managed to thwart<br />\nthe attacks of the Blue Jays and to<br />\nforce the ball into the Hopkins net<br />\nfor the first score of the gante.<br />\nThe Blue Jays immediately retaliated with a goal in the early part<br />\nof the fourth quarter. On a scramble<br />\nnear the Maryland net, the ball was<br />\nin an undecided position until Gough,<br />\nplaying right inside for the Jays,<br />\ncharged through<br />\nwith a beautiful<br />\nboot which terminated in the Terrapin's net.<br />\nThe winning goal of the game was<br />\nscored in the extra period by Henderson, who played center full for University of Maryland. Henderson<br />\npicked a slow roller from a fellow<br />\nPlayer and booted it from close range<br />\ninto the Hopkins net.<br />\nEvery Blue Jay boater turned in a<br />\ngreat performance and Coach Dotterweich expressed his satisfaction with<br />\nhis team. \"We'll be right in there<br />\nnext year with a better and more<br />\nexperienced team.\"<br /><br />\nFraternity Sports<br />\n\u2022<br />\nThe last Saturday in January the<br />\nInterfrat Basketball and Volleyball<br />\nLeagues will be under way.
