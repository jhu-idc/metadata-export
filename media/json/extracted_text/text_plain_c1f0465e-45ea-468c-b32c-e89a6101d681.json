Drs. Lovejoy and<br />\nMitchel were the faculty members present. The former delivered an intensely interesting address in which he said that the<br />\nclub was the most important student organization on the campus<br />\nbecause it is \"the only outward<br />\nmanifestation that students are<br />\nthinking of what is now of paramount importance: namely, the<br />\nsocial sciences or the art of living<br />\ntogether on this planet.\" Dr. Lovejoy gave a rapid sketch of the difficulties in which the world in<br />\ngeneral now finds itself and pointed'out that the club is helping its<br />\nmembers face these problems with<br />\nmore understanding. Dr. Mitchel<br />\nspoke of the work that is being<br />\ndone in Baltimore by people interested in social service.<br />\nThe club intends to enter a vigorous campaign for a larger.<br />\nmembership next year and plans<br />\nwere formulated for giving the<br />\nstudents a real insight into what<br />\nwork the club is doing.<br />\nLively discussion meetings are<br />\nplanned and everyone, regardless<br />\nof his economic beliefs, is welcome.

The second<br />\nissue, on Friday, will deal mainly<br />\nin advance information on the contests and other events scheduled<br />\nfor the next few days.<br />\nThis bi-weekly policy will enable<br />\nthe NEWS-LETTER to be up to the<br />\nm;nute in reporting all events of interest to the student body. It is<br />\nhoped that by calling attention to<br />\nactivities just before their occurrence, and by reporting news before<br />\nit has become stale, a greater interest will be aroused in all college<br />\nenterprises.<br />\nThe size of the paper will be<br />\nchanged so that the new issues will<br />\nhave more of the newspaper form.<br />\nIn its new form, the NEWS-LETTER<br />\nwill consist of two issues of four<br />\npages, 12x19 inches, of five-columns<br />\neach. It is hoped that this will allow all the most important happenings to receive their proper place,<br />\non the front page.<br />\nOf the total space of twenty columns, about eight will be given<br />\nover to advertisements, but the<br />\nspace still remaining for reading<br />\nmatter will be at least as large as<br />\nat present in the eight-page issue.<br />\nThese changes, it is felt, will<br />\nmake the NEWS<br />\neven more<br />\nattractive and useful by enabling<br />\nit to carry out to a greater degree<br />\nit efforts to chronicle faithfully<br />\nour college life.<br />\nThe NEWS-LETTER will continue<br />\nto publish the Daily Bulletin.<br />\n-LETTER<br />\n<br />\nR. 0. T. C. STAGES DRESS<br />\nPARADE<br />\nOn Thursday, May 26, the R.0.<br />\nT. C. carried out an impressive<br />\ndress parade on the upper quadrangle. It was followed by a formal guard mount by Company A,<br />\nwhich. was also executed in fine<br />\nform. The ceremony was witnessed by a large gathering of the<br />\nstudent body and faculty. The<br />\nmusic for the occasion was furnished by the Camp Holabird<br />\nBand, which added greatly to the<br />\neffect of the parade. After the<br />\nceremonies a competitive drill in<br />\nthe manual of arms was held between the men of the 1st year<br />\nbasic to decide the winner of the<br />\nmedal for the best drilled private.<br />\nIt was won after a hard fight by<br />\nW. C. Wilgis, whose demonstration was practically perfect.<br />\nMajor Gary is very well pleased<br />\nwith the way the students are doing their work and especially by<br />\nthe way those with absences are<br />\nmaking up their lost time. The<br />\nchart in the military office shows<br />\nthat there are only a few students<br />\nwith bad marks against their<br />\nnames, a fact which is most gratifying to the department.<br />\nThe last drill will be held on<br />\nThursday. There will probably be<br />\na review in honor of Governor<br />\nRitchie, followed by the presentation of the company cup and<br />\nother medals. On June 15th all of<br />\nthe students going to training<br />\ncamp will leave for Plattsburg.<br />\nSeventy men have entered their<br />\nnames on the roll. This will probably be the largest contingent<br />\nfrom any one college at the camp.<br />\nEvery one is preparing to do his<br />\nbest in an effort to win the camp<br />\nhonors for Hopkins.<br />\n<br />\n3<br />\n<br />\nSTUDENT COUNCIL ELECTIONS<br />\nCOMPLETED<br />\n<br />\nThe Junior, Sophomore and<br />\nFreshman classes held meetings last<br />\nweek for the purpose of electing<br />\ntheir representatives on the Student Council. Next year's senior<br />\nclass will be represented by Robert C. Hall and Gilson C. Engle,<br />\nwhile the Class of 1923 will be represented by Donald K. Vanneman<br />\nand John Marchant. Edward Morrison was elected as representative<br />\nof the Class of 1924.<br />\nThe Student Council will present<br />\na new constitution at the Thursday<br />\nassembly to be voted on by the student body. Everyone is urged to<br />\nbe there so that it may receive the<br />\nsanction of as many students as<br />\npossible.<br />\n<br />\n\fTHE JOHNS HOPKINS NEWS-LETTER, MAY 31, 1921<br />\n<br />\n4<br />\n<br />\nThe Johns Hopkins News-letter<br />\nFOUNDED 1897.<br />\n<br />\nSENIOR QUESTIONNAIRES<br />\nTHROUGH INTERESTIN':<br />\nLIGHT ON COLLEGE<br />\nTOPICS<br />\n<br />\nTHE BAND<br />\n<br />\nScarcely More Than Half of Class Present At Time of Voting.

It is now rather late in<br />\nthe year to do much about this matter, but we should like to know the<br />\nreason, if there be any, for the flags<br />\nhaving been so conspicuous by their<br />\nabsence during the greater part of<br />\nthe past two terms. We understand<br />\nthat the poles were erected by the<br />\nClass of 1916 in honor of their<br />\nclassmate, \"Bobby\" Layfield, who<br />\nlust his life on the gridiron some<br />\nyears ago.

Dr.<br />\nWest is unlike almost any other<br />\nprofessional man, for without exception they exhort you not to attempt to enter upon the work they<br />\nare engaged in.<br />\nDr. West is now Superintendent of Public Instruction in Baltimore, but Dean Latane, in introducing him, harked back to<br />\ndays in college when he did not<br />\noccupy such an exalted position;<br />\nthe Dean was a Sophomore-Junior<br />\nwhen Dr. West was a Freshman,<br />\nalthough in those days they didn't<br />\n\"treat'em rough\" and consequently there exists no ill-feeling between them. The speaker dealt in<br />\nturn with the business, tone, character. managerial and compensation aspects of the vocation of<br />\nteaching. The last is one which,<br />\nhe confessed, was formerly mentioned in an undertone, but<br />\nwhich, he contended, can now be<br />\nspoken of without shame because<br />\nof the wave of salary advancing<br />\nwhich has swept through the<br />\nteaching world. Superintendents<br />\nare not uncommonly paid in some<br />\ncities as much as ten or fifteen<br />\nthousand dollars a year which is<br />\nall salary as there are no expenses<br />\nwhatsoever to be 'deducted. Dr.<br />\nWest concluded with paraphrasing his opening sentence, \"Why<br />\nbe a schoolmaster\" into\"Why not<br />\nbe a schoolmaster.\"<br />\nMajor 0. 0. Ellis, last year's<br />\nCommandant of the R. 0. T. C.,<br />\nspoke immediately preceding Dr.<br />\nWest in a talk which he charac-,<br />\nterized as being like the gown ordered in Paris \"long enough to<br />\ncover the subject, but short<br />\nenough to be interesting.\" His<br />\nsubject was the Civilian Red,<br />\nWhite and Blue Summer Camp,<br />\nwhich he covered very well, but<br />\nhe expects the student body to<br />\ncover it even better when the folders explaining the object of the<br />\ncamp are placed in the mail boxes.<br />\nDean Latane then announced<br />\nthat the Maryland and Woodyear<br />\nscholarships are tenable for one<br />\nyear only and must be applied for<br />\neach year by the students desiring<br />\n\u2022<br />\nthem.<br />\n<br />\nThe basket-ball team in its third<br />\nyear at J.

A.<br />\n<br />\nDORMITORY FUND COMPLETED<br />\nBut High Cost of Materials Produce<br />\nUnavoidable Delay.<br />\n<br />\nIt has long been realized that dormitories have been the greatest need<br />\nof the University since it moved to<br />\nHomewood. The athletic teams<br />\nhave always been a credit to Hopkins; the spirit of the undergraduate student body has been good;<br />\nwhen one considers the great handicap under which they have labored,<br />\nbecause of the fact that the students have not lived on the campus.<br />\nIt was, therefore, fe!t that with the<br />\nestablishment of dormitories at<br />\nJohns Hopkins there would be added whatever has been lacking in college life here in the past.<br />\nAccordingly, the Alumni Association conducted a campaign last<br />\nycar to raise $300,000 for the building of a dormitory as a memorial<br />\ntc the Hopkins men who gave their<br />\nlives during ,the world war. With<br />\nthe aid of the Trustees the drive resulted in raising the- entire amount.<br />\nAt first it was thought that the new<br />\nbuilding would be ready for use by<br />\nthe opening of the 1921-22 term,<br />\nbut as the cost of building material<br />\nhas remained unusually high, due to<br />\npost-war prices, it was decided that<br />\nthe building of the dormitory should<br />\nbe postponed until the cost of materials shall have been reduced. At<br />\npresent the indications are that<br />\nground \u2022 will be broken some time<br />\nthis summer. This means that the<br />\nbuilding will probably not be corn<br />\npleted before next spring.<br />\nLEHIGH'S POINT OF VIEW<br />\nLACROSSE<br />\n<br />\nThis game is played after this<br />\nfashion: Rules are not used. They<br />\nare found to be superfluous, since<br />\nthey would take some of the, as it<br />\nwere, zest, out of the game. About<br />\ntwelve murderers are employed on<br />\neach side, each provided with a<br />\nweapon probably known as a<br />\n\"mashie\", as its principle use is to<br />\nmash in the heads of the opposing<br />\nplayers. The score is kept by scars<br />\nand wounds\u2014that is, the final<br />\nscore of the game might be; two<br />\nfractured wrists and a broken collar-bone to one slight concussion<br />\nof the brain. This would, of course<br />\nbe a virtual tie, the victory being<br />\npurely a moral one. While other<br />\ngames may be won by a hair or a<br />\nfoot, lacrosse is the only game<br />\nthat can be won by a nose. It will<br />\nbe seen that a man with flat ears<br />\nand in-grown feet has great possibilities as a lacrosser. It also<br />\nappears to be the custom for every<br />\nman to enter the game with a<br />\n<br />\n\f9<br />\n<br />\nTHE JOHNS HOPKINS NEWS-LETTER, MAY 31, 1921<br />\nbroad smile on his face and as he<br />\ncracks his opponent's skull, to remark, \"Pardon me, old bean\", or<br />\nsomething equally appropriate.<br />\nHis victim must answer \"Don't<br />\nmention it\" and die with a smile<br />\non what is left of his face.<br />\nLacrosse must soon be America's national sport, for its laxity<br />\nwith regard to rules and its hazzards make it especially fitted to<br />\n\"the land of the free and the home<br />\nof the brave.\"<br />\n\u2014Lehigh Burr.<br />\n(Continued from page 10, col. 1)<br />\n<br />\nmounted upon a smooth gold rectangulahr background of proportional size.

Cotton to Be Chairman of<br />\nCouncil Next Year.<br />\n<br />\nAt a recent meeting of the Varsity Seal Voting Council honorary<br />\nawards were made to John Myers,<br />\nthe postmaster and Fulton R. Bramble, former editor-in-chief of the<br />\nBlack and Blue Jay. It is gratifying<br />\nto note that Mr. Myers' long service<br />\nto undergraduate activities at Hopkins has been recognized by an<br />\naward which is one of the most coveted honors obtainable at Hopkins.<br />\nThose men who received stars for<br />\ntwo activities on their seals are as<br />\nfollows: E. S. Huey, NEWS-LETTER<br />\nand Hullabaloo; F. R. Smith,<br />\nNEWS-LETTER and Dramatic Club<br />\nR. H.

Bramble.<br />\nFor a long time there had been<br />\nat the University a growing sentiment in favor of giving some kind<br />\no f recognition to the men who<br />\nachieved success in the non-athletic<br />\nforms of collegiate activities. Last<br />\nyear a Varsity Seal Voting Council was instituted, which awards a<br />\nVarsity Seal to every man who<br />\nqualifies in any of the five major<br />\nactivities, namely, the Hullabaloo,<br />\nthe NEWS-LETTER, the Musical<br />\nClubs, the Dramatic Club and the<br />\nDebating Team. The government<br />\not the Varsity Seal Organization is<br />\nvested in a council composed of two<br />\nmen from each of the organizations<br />\nwhose members are entitled to the<br />\nSeal. As a student organization<br />\nit is especially desirable because the<br />\nrequirements for membership are<br />\nbid down in a definite set of rules,<br />\nthus making it certain that any man<br />\nwho takes part in Hopkins activities will receive the award without<br />\nthe possibility that politics will deprive him of that honor.<br />\nThe award is in the form of a<br />\nminiature reproduction in gold of<br />\nthe official seal of the University,<br />\n(Continued on page 9, col. 1)<br />\n<br />\n(Continued from page 1, col. 3)<br />\n<br />\nprobably co-operate with the University authorities in keeping an accurate record of each student's<br />\nhonors, athletic and non-athletic<br />\nrecords. These records will be used<br />\nfor reference after graduation and<br />\nwill be forwarded to prep schools<br />\nand parents with the customary<br />\nmid-year and commencement examination marks.<br />\nA committee of 0 D K interviewed the Dean and President recently, recommending that new<br />\nlock and key boxes be substituted<br />\nit the postoffice for the present call<br />\nboxes, and also that each student be<br />\nassigned a box by the registrar<br />\nupon registration. The latter of<br />\nthese changes and, if possible, the<br />\nfcrmer, will be put into effect.<br />\nThe cup which is to be awarded<br />\nby the circle to the man who has<br />\ndone the most for Hopkins during<br />\nhis college course has been selected<br />\nand will be put on exhibition as<br />\nsoon as possible. The winner, who<br />\nwill be judged on qualities of leadership by Deans Latane or Whitehead, according to whether he is<br />\nan academic or engineering student,<br />\non leadership in athletics by Coach<br />\nVan Orman, and on leadership in<br />\nDr.<br />\nby<br />\nnon-athletic activities<br />\nFrench, will not be announced until Commencement day.<br />\nAt the request of Major Garey.<br />\na committee composed of -non-military members investigated the R.0<br />\nT C., and upon its report the circle unanimously decided to endorse<br />\nthe R. 0. T. C., and tolen d its aid<br />\nin increasing the enrollment next<br />\nyear. A resolution commending<br />\nthe Undergraduate Band upon its<br />\nnotable achievements and urging<br />\nthe students to support this organization to the best of their ability<br />\nwas also passed.<br />\nThe circle has various suggestions and projects forth e betterment of Hopkins under consideration and hopes to be one of the most<br />\nprogressive and active organizations upon the campus next year.<br />\n\"The time you waste daily is<br />\nworth money,\" bellowed the orator.<br />\n\"Guess I'd better be moseying<br />\nalong, then,\" said an auditor as he<br />\nrose from a seat in the front row.<br />\n<br />\nPOLLACK'S<br />\nISAAC DAVIDSON k Props.<br />\nWM.

A number of prominent speakers have given interesting lectures and the members<br />\nof the club feel that they have<br />\nbeen benefited very much.<br />\nNext year the club intends to<br />\nextend its activities on a large<br />\nscale. It proposes to give a series<br />\nof lectures by prominent speakers, corresponding to a series of<br />\nlectures in literature. These are to<br />\nbe given at night in the C.

The game<br />\nwas one-sided throughout and<br />\nconsequently devoid of thrills.<br />\nTucker hurled well for the Black<br />\nand Blue nine and had excellent<br />\nsupport. The feature of the game<br />\nwas the fielding of \"Buck\" Grace,<br />\nHopkins' snappy second sacker,<br />\nwho plucked three burning line<br />\ndrives from the air that would<br />\notherwise probably have made<br />\nscores for the lads from Westminster. Keen also, in his handling<br />\nof. the first base position, showed<br />\nfine form. In the eighth inning<br />\n\"Mike\" Levin was run into our<br />\nbattery as catcher and \"Bobby\"<br />\nOwings w,as placed in right field.<br />\nThe visitors registered but 5 hits<br />\nduring the game and scored their<br />\ntwo runs in the ninth inning on a<br />\ntwo-base hit by Long.<br />\nThe box score follows:<br />\nGrace,2b<br />\nReifschneider,ss<br />\nHayter,cf<br />\nSharretts,lf<br />\nKeen,lb<br />\nKnecht,rf,lf<br />\nWood,c<br />\nStrouse,3b<br />\nTucker,p<br />\nOwin gs,rf<br />\nLevin,c<br /><br />\nAB.<br />\n3<br />\n5<br />\n4<br />\n4<br />\n3<br />\n3<br />\n3<br />\n4<br />\n3<br />\n0<br />\n1<br /><br />\nR.<br />\n2<br />\n1<br />\n1<br />\n2<br />\n0<br />\n1<br />\n1<br />\n1<br />\n1<br />\n0<br />\n0<br /><br />\nH.<br />\n2<br />\n2<br />\n1<br />\n2<br />\n1<br />\n1<br />\n2<br />\n1<br />\n0<br />\n0<br />\n0<br /><br />\n0.<br />\n6<br />\n0<br />\n0<br />\n0<br />\n9<br />\n2<br />\n7<br />\n1<br />\n0<br />\n1<br />\n1<br /><br />\nTotals<br />\n33 10 12 27<br />\nWESTERN MARYLAND<br />\nAB.

Dr. Lovejoy Is Speaker.<br /><br />\nWill Adopt Changed Policy Next Year.<br />\nWill Appear on Tuesdays and<br />\nFridays.<br /><br />\nThe Social Science Club held a<br />\nthoroughly successful banquet<br />\nlast Thursday night at the Johns<br />\nHopkins Club. Drs. Lovejoy and<br />\nMitchel were the faculty members present. The former delivered an intensely interesting address in which he said that the<br />\nclub was the most important student organization on the campus<br />\nbecause it is \"the only outward<br />\nmanifestation that students are<br />\nthinking of what is now of paramount importance: namely, the<br />\nsocial sciences or the art of living<br />\ntogether on this planet.\" Dr. Lovejoy gave a rapid sketch of the difficulties in which the world in<br />\ngeneral now finds itself and pointed'out that the club is helping its<br />\nmembers face these problems with<br />\nmore understanding. Dr. Mitchel<br />\nspoke of the work that is being<br />\ndone in Baltimore by people interested in social service.<br />\nThe club intends to enter a vigorous campaign for a larger.<br />\nmembership next year and plans<br />\nwere formulated for giving the<br />\nstudents a real insight into what<br />\nwork the club is doing.<br />\nLively discussion meetings are<br />\nplanned and everyone, regardless<br />\nof his economic beliefs, is welcome. An effort is being made to<br />\nbring the most prominent men<br />\npossible to the university for the<br />\nusual series of public lectures.<br />\nLITERARY CLUB<br /><br />\nThe Literary Club will have one<br />\nmore meeting before bringing the<br />\nseason to a close. The date of the<br />\nmeeting has not yet been announced.<br />\nAlthough there has been a<br />\nchange in officers the same policy<br />\nas outlined this year will be continued next year.<br />\nINTERFRATERNITY BANQUET HELD<br /><br />\nAn interfraternity banquet was<br />\nheld at the Barn on Friday evening, May 20. There were about<br />\nforty-five men present, representing every fraternity on the camZIONIST SOCIETY<br />\npus. The idea was originated by<br />\nAt the last meeting of the year the interfraternity board.<br />\nof .the Johns Hopkins Zionist SoBartor Griffin was toastmaster<br />\nciety the following officers were of the occasion and called for<br />\nelected: President, Benson Bloom; speeches from one man of each<br />\nVice-President, Isador Terlitzky ; fraternity. The speakers were CarSecretary, J. E. Finesinger ; Treas- oil French, Bartus Trew, Robert<br />\nurer, S. H. Levin Morvitz.

The second<br />\nissue, on Friday, will deal mainly<br />\nin advance information on the contests and other events scheduled<br />\nfor the next few days.<br />\nThis bi-weekly policy will enable<br />\nthe NEWS-LETTER to be up to the<br />\nm;nute in reporting all events of interest to the student body. It is<br />\nhoped that by calling attention to<br />\nactivities just before their occurrence, and by reporting news before<br />\nit has become stale, a greater interest will be aroused in all college<br />\nenterprises.<br />\nThe size of the paper will be<br />\nchanged so that the new issues will<br />\nhave more of the newspaper form.<br />\nIn its new form, the NEWS-LETTER<br />\nwill consist of two issues of four<br />\npages, 12x19 inches, of five-columns<br />\neach. It is hoped that this will allow all the most important happenings to receive their proper place,<br />\non the front page.<br />\nOf the total space of twenty columns, about eight will be given<br />\nover to advertisements, but the<br />\nspace still remaining for reading<br />\nmatter will be at least as large as<br />\nat present in the eight-page issue.<br />\nThese changes, it is felt, will<br />\nmake the NEWS<br />\neven more<br />\nattractive and useful by enabling<br />\nit to carry out to a greater degree<br />\nit efforts to chronicle faithfully<br />\nour college life.<br />\nThe NEWS-LETTER will continue<br />\nto publish the Daily Bulletin.<br />\n-LETTER<br /><br />\nR. 0. T. C. STAGES DRESS<br />\nPARADE<br />\nOn Thursday, May 26, the R.0.<br />\nT. C. carried out an impressive<br />\ndress parade on the upper quadrangle. It was followed by a formal guard mount by Company A,<br />\nwhich. was also executed in fine<br />\nform. The ceremony was witnessed by a large gathering of the<br />\nstudent body and faculty. The<br />\nmusic for the occasion was furnished by the Camp Holabird<br />\nBand, which added greatly to the<br />\neffect of the parade. After the<br />\nceremonies a competitive drill in<br />\nthe manual of arms was held between the men of the 1st year<br />\nbasic to decide the winner of the<br />\nmedal for the best drilled private.<br />\nIt was won after a hard fight by<br />\nW. C. Wilgis, whose demonstration was practically perfect.<br />\nMajor Gary is very well pleased<br />\nwith the way the students are doing their work and especially by<br />\nthe way those with absences are<br />\nmaking up their lost time. The<br />\nchart in the military office shows<br />\nthat there are only a few students<br />\nwith bad marks against their<br />\nnames, a fact which is most gratifying to the department.<br />\nThe last drill will be held on<br />\nThursday. There will probably be<br />\na review in honor of Governor<br />\nRitchie, followed by the presentation of the company cup and<br />\nother medals. On June 15th all of<br />\nthe students going to training<br />\ncamp will leave for Plattsburg.<br />\nSeventy men have entered their<br />\nnames on the roll. This will probably be the largest contingent<br />\nfrom any one college at the camp.<br />\nEvery one is preparing to do his<br />\nbest in an effort to win the camp<br />\nhonors for Hopkins.<br /><br />\n3<br /><br />\nSTUDENT COUNCIL ELECTIONS<br />\nCOMPLETED<br /><br />\nThe Junior, Sophomore and<br />\nFreshman classes held meetings last<br />\nweek for the purpose of electing<br />\ntheir representatives on the Student Council. Next year's senior<br />\nclass will be represented by Robert C. Hall and Gilson C. Engle,<br />\nwhile the Class of 1923 will be represented by Donald K. Vanneman<br />\nand John Marchant. Edward Morrison was elected as representative<br />\nof the Class of 1924.<br />\nThe Student Council will present<br />\na new constitution at the Thursday<br />\nassembly to be voted on by the student body.

Through<br />\ntheir conscientious and untiring efforts the NEWS-LETTER, with the<br />\npossible exception of this issue,<br />\nwhich because of its increased size<br />\nhas required more time to run<br />\nthrough the presses, has not once<br />\nthroughout the year failed to \"come<br />\nout\" on time to the very -minute.<br />\n'This is an accomplishment of which<br /><br />\nAt its last meeting.

The team this<br />\nyear was strong but inexperienced;<br />\nwith the valuable knowledge gained<br />\nin the spring practice sessions and<br />\nwith a month of work in the fundamentals and rudiments of the game<br />\nat Camp Red Cloud, Hopkins next<br />\nfall will have a winning aggregation on the field and will aspire to<br />\nthe state championship.<br /><br />\nBOWERS CHOSEN MOST POPULAR MAN IN THE<br />\nSENIOR CLASS<br /><br />\nWHY NOT BE A TEACHER IS<br />\nQUESTION ASKED AT<br />\nASSEMBLY<br /><br />\nHis Will Be First Name on Sigma Chi<br />\nBeta Tablet. Was Chosen by Entire Student Body.<br /><br />\nDr. West, Superintendent of Public Instruction, Gives Smooth Talk on<br />\n\"Teaching As a Vocation.\" Col.<br />\nEllis Also Says a Few Words.<br /><br />\nThe name of Ralph Firestone<br />\nBowers, '21, will be the first to<br />\nappear upon the bronze tablet<br />\nthat the Sigma Chi Beta Honorman Hall, to contain each year the<br />\nname of the most popular man in<br />\nthe graduating class. \"Mike\"<br />\nBowers was chosen by almost<br />\nunanimous vote of the entire student body at a general assembly<br />\nsome weeks ago. An . hour has<br />\nbeen set aside from the class day<br />\nexercises on June 20 for the unveiling of the Sigma Chi Beta tablet, the presentation of which<br />\npromises to establish one of the<br />\nmost-to-be-coveted honors that a<br />\nman can receive in his four years<br />\nat Johns Hopkins.<br />\nA noteworthy feature of the<br />\nchoice of the most popular senior<br />\nis that he was selected neither by<br />\nthe senior class nor by Sigma Chi<br />\nBeta itself, but by the voice of<br />\nthe whole undergraduate student<br />\nbody.<br />\nThe names of succeeding most<br />\npopular men will be placed annually upon the tablet in Gilman<br />\nHall in time for the graduating<br />\nexercises of each senior class.<br /><br />\nBefore one of the smallest gatherings that has attended the assemblies this year, Dr. Henry S.<br />\nWest, A.B., '93, Ph.D., '99, delivered an address that belied its<br />\ntitle, \"Teaching As a Vocation.<br />\nin that it was nothing like as \"dry\"<br />\nas the topic would indicate. Dr.<br />\nWest is unlike almost any other<br />\nprofessional man, for without exception they exhort you not to attempt to enter upon the work they<br />\nare engaged in.<br />\nDr. West is now Superintendent of Public Instruction in Baltimore, but Dean Latane, in introducing him, harked back to<br />\ndays in college when he did not<br />\noccupy such an exalted position;<br />\nthe Dean was a Sophomore-Junior<br />\nwhen Dr. West was a Freshman,<br />\nalthough in those days they didn't<br />\n\"treat'em rough\" and consequently there exists no ill-feeling between them. The speaker dealt in<br />\nturn with the business, tone, character. managerial and compensation aspects of the vocation of<br />\nteaching. The last is one which,<br />\nhe confessed, was formerly mentioned in an undertone, but<br />\nwhich, he contended, can now be<br />\nspoken of without shame because<br />\nof the wave of salary advancing<br />\nwhich has swept through the<br />\nteaching world. Superintendents<br />\nare not uncommonly paid in some<br />\ncities as much as ten or fifteen<br />\nthousand dollars a year which is<br />\nall salary as there are no expenses<br />\nwhatsoever to be 'deducted. Dr.<br />\nWest concluded with paraphrasing his opening sentence, \"Why<br />\nbe a schoolmaster\" into\"Why not<br />\nbe a schoolmaster.\"<br />\nMajor 0. 0. Ellis, last year's<br />\nCommandant of the R. 0. T. C.,<br />\nspoke immediately preceding Dr.<br />\nWest in a talk which he charac-,<br />\nterized as being like the gown ordered in Paris \"long enough to<br />\ncover the subject, but short<br />\nenough to be interesting.\" His<br />\nsubject was the Civilian Red,<br />\nWhite and Blue Summer Camp,<br />\nwhich he covered very well, but<br />\nhe expects the student body to<br />\ncover it even better when the folders explaining the object of the<br />\ncamp are placed in the mail boxes.<br />\nDean Latane then announced<br />\nthat the Maryland and Woodyear<br />\nscholarships are tenable for one<br />\nyear only and must be applied for<br />\neach year by the students desiring<br />\n\u2022<br />\nthem.<br /><br />\nThe basket-ball team in its third<br />\nyear at J. H. U. was coached very<br />\nably by Dr. Lamborn. Teams from<br />\nthe South and North were met and<br />\na trip to the North was made in<br />\nwhich three teams were encounteret'. The champion Center College<br />\nfive from Kentucky was barely victorious in the last game of the year believe that more colleges will put<br />\nat the Fifth Regiment Armory, lacrosse squads in the field in the<br />\nwhere all home games are staged.<br />\nnear future.

A.<br /><br />\nDORMITORY FUND COMPLETED<br />\nBut High Cost of Materials Produce<br />\nUnavoidable Delay.<br /><br />\nIt has long been realized that dormitories have been the greatest need<br />\nof the University since it moved to<br />\nHomewood. The athletic teams<br />\nhave always been a credit to Hopkins; the spirit of the undergraduate student body has been good;<br />\nwhen one considers the great handicap under which they have labored,<br />\nbecause of the fact that the students have not lived on the campus.<br />\nIt was, therefore, fe!t that with the<br />\nestablishment of dormitories at<br />\nJohns Hopkins there would be added whatever has been lacking in college life here in the past.<br />\nAccordingly, the Alumni Association conducted a campaign last<br />\nycar to raise $300,000 for the building of a dormitory as a memorial<br />\ntc the Hopkins men who gave their<br />\nlives during ,the world war. With<br />\nthe aid of the Trustees the drive resulted in raising the- entire amount.<br />\nAt first it was thought that the new<br />\nbuilding would be ready for use by<br />\nthe opening of the 1921-22 term,<br />\nbut as the cost of building material<br />\nhas remained unusually high, due to<br />\npost-war prices, it was decided that<br />\nthe building of the dormitory should<br />\nbe postponed until the cost of materials shall have been reduced. At<br />\npresent the indications are that<br />\nground \u2022 will be broken some time<br />\nthis summer. This means that the<br />\nbuilding will probably not be corn<br />\npleted before next spring.<br />\nLEHIGH'S POINT OF VIEW<br />\nLACROSSE<br /><br />\nThis game is played after this<br />\nfashion: Rules are not used. They<br />\nare found to be superfluous, since<br />\nthey would take some of the, as it<br />\nwere, zest, out of the game. About<br />\ntwelve murderers are employed on<br />\neach side, each provided with a<br />\nweapon probably known as a<br />\n\"mashie\", as its principle use is to<br />\nmash in the heads of the opposing<br />\nplayers. The score is kept by scars<br />\nand wounds\u2014that is, the final<br />\nscore of the game might be; two<br />\nfractured wrists and a broken collar-bone to one slight concussion<br />\nof the brain. This would, of course<br />\nbe a virtual tie, the victory being<br />\npurely a moral one. While other<br />\ngames may be won by a hair or a<br />\nfoot, lacrosse is the only game<br />\nthat can be won by a nose. It will<br />\nbe seen that a man with flat ears<br />\nand in-grown feet has great possibilities as a lacrosser. It also<br />\nappears to be the custom for every<br />\nman to enter the game with a<br /><br />\n9<br /><br />\nTHE JOHNS HOPKINS NEWS-LETTER, MAY 31, 1921<br />\nbroad smile on his face and as he<br />\ncracks his opponent's skull, to remark, \"Pardon me, old bean\", or<br />\nsomething equally appropriate.<br />\nHis victim must answer \"Don't<br />\nmention it\" and die with a smile<br />\non what is left of his face.<br />\nLacrosse must soon be America's national sport, for its laxity<br />\nwith regard to rules and its hazzards make it especially fitted to<br />\n\"the land of the free and the home<br />\nof the brave.\"<br />\n\u2014Lehigh Burr.<br />\n(Continued from page 10, col. 1)<br /><br />\nmounted upon a smooth gold rectangulahr background of proportional size.

Cotton to Be Chairman of<br />\nCouncil Next Year.<br /><br />\nAt a recent meeting of the Varsity Seal Voting Council honorary<br />\nawards were made to John Myers,<br />\nthe postmaster and Fulton R. Bramble, former editor-in-chief of the<br />\nBlack and Blue Jay. It is gratifying<br />\nto note that Mr. Myers' long service<br />\nto undergraduate activities at Hopkins has been recognized by an<br />\naward which is one of the most coveted honors obtainable at Hopkins.<br />\nThose men who received stars for<br />\ntwo activities on their seals are as<br />\nfollows: E. S. Huey, NEWS-LETTER<br />\nand Hullabaloo; F. R. Smith,<br />\nNEWS-LETTER and Dramatic Club<br />\nR. H.

Bramble.<br />\nFor a long time there had been<br />\nat the University a growing sentiment in favor of giving some kind<br />\no f recognition to the men who<br />\nachieved success in the non-athletic<br />\nforms of collegiate activities. Last<br />\nyear a Varsity Seal Voting Council was instituted, which awards a<br />\nVarsity Seal to every man who<br />\nqualifies in any of the five major<br />\nactivities, namely, the Hullabaloo,<br />\nthe NEWS-LETTER, the Musical<br />\nClubs, the Dramatic Club and the<br />\nDebating Team. The government<br />\not the Varsity Seal Organization is<br />\nvested in a council composed of two<br />\nmen from each of the organizations<br />\nwhose members are entitled to the<br />\nSeal. As a student organization<br />\nit is especially desirable because the<br />\nrequirements for membership are<br />\nbid down in a definite set of rules,<br />\nthus making it certain that any man<br />\nwho takes part in Hopkins activities will receive the award without<br />\nthe possibility that politics will deprive him of that honor.<br />\nThe award is in the form of a<br />\nminiature reproduction in gold of<br />\nthe official seal of the University,<br />\n(Continued on page 9, col. 1)<br /><br />\n(Continued from page 1, col. 3)<br /><br />\nprobably co-operate with the University authorities in keeping an accurate record of each student's<br />\nhonors, athletic and non-athletic<br />\nrecords. These records will be used<br />\nfor reference after graduation and<br />\nwill be forwarded to prep schools<br />\nand parents with the customary<br />\nmid-year and commencement examination marks.<br />\nA committee of 0 D K interviewed the Dean and President recently, recommending that new<br />\nlock and key boxes be substituted<br />\nit the postoffice for the present call<br />\nboxes, and also that each student be<br />\nassigned a box by the registrar<br />\nupon registration. The latter of<br />\nthese changes and, if possible, the<br />\nfcrmer, will be put into effect.<br />\nThe cup which is to be awarded<br />\nby the circle to the man who has<br />\ndone the most for Hopkins during<br />\nhis college course has been selected<br />\nand will be put on exhibition as<br />\nsoon as possible. The winner, who<br />\nwill be judged on qualities of leadership by Deans Latane or Whitehead, according to whether he is<br />\nan academic or engineering student,<br />\non leadership in athletics by Coach<br />\nVan Orman, and on leadership in<br />\nDr.<br />\nby<br />\nnon-athletic activities<br />\nFrench, will not be announced until Commencement day.<br />\nAt the request of Major Garey.<br />\na committee composed of -non-military members investigated the R.0<br />\nT C., and upon its report the circle unanimously decided to endorse<br />\nthe R. 0. T. C., and tolen d its aid<br />\nin increasing the enrollment next<br />\nyear. A resolution commending<br />\nthe Undergraduate Band upon its<br />\nnotable achievements and urging<br />\nthe students to support this organization to the best of their ability<br />\nwas also passed.<br />\nThe circle has various suggestions and projects forth e betterment of Hopkins under consideration and hopes to be one of the most<br />\nprogressive and active organizations upon the campus next year.<br />\n\"The time you waste daily is<br />\nworth money,\" bellowed the orator.<br />\n\"Guess I'd better be moseying<br />\nalong, then,\" said an auditor as he<br />\nrose from a seat in the front row.<br /><br />\nPOLLACK'S<br />\nISAAC DAVIDSON k Props.<br />\nWM.
