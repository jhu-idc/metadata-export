Critics of the<br />\nViolence Commission have said<br />\nthat setting up a commission such<br />\nas yours after the death of Robert<br />\nKennedy is \"the kind of things<br />\npresidents do when they don't<br />\nknow what else to do.\" The tack<br />\nthat a lot of the criticism has<br />\ntaken is that the Commission was<br />\nestablished by the President to assure the people that some thing<br />\nwas being done about a tragic situation. What is your reaction?<br />\nEISENHOWER \u2014 If the Commission did a quick, superficial job, it<br />\nwould certainly make no contribution to the President, the Congress,<br />\nand the American people. In that<br />\ncase, the charges you have seen by<br />\nsome columnists (would be justified. I hope we don't do that kind<br />\nof work. We have brought together some of the finest psychiatrists,<br />\npsychologists, sociologists, neurologists, historians, criminologists<br />\nin the country to examine the<br />\nvarious aspects of violence: assasination, individual acts of violence,<br />\nsuch as homicide, and third, group<br />\nviolence. And we have as scholarly<br />\ntask forces in these three areas as<br />\none could possibly bring together.<br />\nThen we have task forces on<br />\nthe influence on the mass media,<br />\non gun control, on the legal aspects of the entire probelm - both arrest, conviction and sentencing. And finally a task force,<br />\ninvolving, incidentally a Hopkins<br />\nscholar, on sort of a sociological<br />\nand historical aspect of violence,<br />\nwhich may be very revealing. If<br />\none compares the whole history of<br />\nviolence in the United States with<br />\nthat of Great Britian, Germany.<br />\nand France, let us say this may be<br />\nvery revealing.<br />\nThe problem is, we have promised to file the President at least<br />\na preliminary report at least by<br />\nDecember 31, if possible, or just<br />\nbefore he leaves office.

The statistical evidence is frightening. Why is<br />\nit that we have 60 times as many<br />\nmurders per hundred-thousand<br />\npopulation in this\u2022country as they<br />\ndo in Great Britian? We know the<br />\nfacts, but I'm afraid that when<br />\none seeks to determine the causes<br />\nof the degree of violence in this<br />\ncountry, the reasons given are<br />\nmere pre-conceptions, and are not<br />\nbased on the kind of hard evidence<br />\nthat I hope we can bring together.<br />\nWe know a great deal about how<br />\nmuch violence there is, but not<br />\nabout what the real causes are. I<br />\nthink that is what we have to find<br />\nout and that is what the commission is working on.<br />\nN-L \u2014 What the gist of the criticisms seem to be, and the point<br />\nI'm getting at, is that it can be<br />\ncharged that the establishment of<br />\na commission was for \"show\" - -<br />\n<br />\nto assure people that the assassination of Robert Kennedy was not<br />\nleaving us helpless as tO solutions.<br />\nEISENHOWER \u2014 I want to say<br />\nthat I personally wouldn't be connected with it if it were only a<br />\n\"show.\" I would have no inducement, politically or otherwise, to<br />\nmake a show for a Democratic<br />\nPresident.<br />\nMay I say that the commission<br />\nitself is a very good cross section<br />\nof high-level America. Judge Higginbotham, a black man and judge<br />\nfrom Philadelphia,is absolutely superb. Mrs. Harris,a woman lawyer,<br />\na Negro woman and former ambassador, is superb. Archbishop<br />\nCooke, Hoffer, the labor longshoreman from California, and so<br />\non. It's a good commission. I'm<br />\nsure no member of the commission<br />\nhas any intention of making a<br />\n\"show.\"<br />\nI'm sure no member of this<br />\ncommission would be at work<br />\nmerely as sort of a soothing balm<br />\nto the public for a very tragic<br />\nthing that occurred.<br />\nN-L \u2014 Then, as to the criticism,<br />\nit seems like it would be bound<br />\nto happen with any Presidential<br />\nappointment, that people would<br />\nturn it into a political question. It<br />\nwas suggested that the reason the<br />\nCommission is looking into Chicago is because President Johnson<br />\nwanted to forestall any kind of<br />\ndamaging congressional investigation.<br />\nEISENHOWER \u2014 Well, I didn't<br />\ntalk to President Johnson. The<br />\ncharter \u2014 the executive order<br />\nthat brought our commission into<br />\nbeing is so broad that we had ample authority to do this, but to<br />\nshow you that our study of the<br />\nChicago situation has no possible<br />\npolitical implication is that we<br />\nwill not report on that before<br />\nNovember 5.<br />\nN-L \u2014 Another problem with<br />\nPresidential commissions is that in<br />\n<br />\nGAUGUIN<br />\na psychiatrist who<br />\nwas retained by the Kennedy Administration to analyze Khrushchev's mind, explains that his<br />\nfindings were pretty exact, with<br />\none exception.

I may say that I am deeply<br />\nconcerned about the tremendous<br />\ngrowth - - just drawing a crude figure out of the air - - of violence<br />\nwhich has increased about 70% in<br />\nthe last six or seven years.<br />\nThere are some new things in<br />\nthis violence - - and this is merely<br />\nfactual and not drawing a conclusion: violence on the campus is<br />\nnew. Now, it's true throughout<br />\nour history, the New York draft<br />\n<br />\nmost is time. If we had three years,<br />\nin which to do the most scientific<br />\npossible job, I would then be<br />\nthoroughly confident that we<br />\ncould come up with a report that<br />\nwould be of value to the President, the Congress, and the American people.<br />\nWho knows? This may happen.<br />\nI rather think that on the basis of<br />\nwhatever evidence we have now,<br />\nthat further research is needed. I<br />\nmean very serious research.

As a former university<br />\npresident, how would you have<br />\nhandled the uprising at Columbia<br />\nlast spring?<br />\nEISENHOWER \u2014 No, I'm not going to second-guess Grayson Kirk.<br />\nI think that one would have to<br />\nhave lived on the Columbia campus, been a part of the Columbia<br />\nfamily, to know whether the difficulty went back many years or<br />\nwhether it was an unexpected<br />\nsituation that no one could have<br />\ncontrolled.

I certainly don't think it's justified. I can't<br />\nthink of any other place in the<br />\nworld which is as open to the free<br />\nforces of consultation and discussion to settle disputes.<br />\nIf we are going to resort to violence on the campus, it would<br />\nseem to me that this would foreshadow anarchy in the United<br />\nStates.

To what extent is the<br />\ncommission going to look into<br />\ncampus violence, such as the Columbia uprising?<br />\nEI<br />\nSENHOWER \u2014 One of the subdivisions of the investigation of<br />\ngroup violence is the subject of<br />\nillegal actions including violence<br />\nOn<br />\n_campuses.

His<br />\nsupport ofthe guaranteed income<br />\nis based on the following<br />\nassumptions: our country is<br />\nwealthy enough to allow none of<br />\nits citizens to starve,regardless of<br />\nwhether they work or not;<br />\neconomic incentives must be<br />\npresent to encourage the<br />\nunemployed to work; and our<br />\nnation is based on personal<br />\nfreedom which prohibits direct<br />\nsupervision of individual lives by<br />\nany organization.<br />\nThe Economics professor<br />\nstated that the present welfare<br />\nsystem accomplishes none of<br />\nthese objectives.<br />\n\"It destroys initiative by<br />\nreducing welfare payments when<br />\nthe recipient earns income.<br />\nToday any earnings above $30 a<br />\nmonth reduces the welfare check<br />\nby $1 for each $1 earned, or,in<br />\nother words, it is a 100% tax.<br />\nThese traditional techniques are<br />\ndegrading and destroy individual<br />\nincentive and hope.\"<br />\nSupports Negative Invome Tax<br />\nDr. Poole sees two plans as<br />\nholding the most promise in<br />\nhandling this federal dole,<br />\nalthough there are other<br />\nalternatives. One idea that has<br />\ngained Dr. Poole's support was<br />\nproposed by Dr. Milton Friedman<br />\nof the University of Chicago. His<br />\nplan would employ the $3,000 of<br />\npersonal exemptions and<br />\ndeductions for a four member<br />\nfamily now used by the federal<br />\nincome tax as the standard for<br />\nproviding annual income.<br />\nIf a family of four earned<br />\n$2,000, for example, the<br />\ndifference between this sum and<br />\nthe $3,000 figure would be<br />\nassessed at maybe 50%,therefore<br />\nadding. $500 to the earned<br />\nincome. This so-called \"negative<br />\nincome tax\" would yield then,<br />\nusing this system, half of$3,000,<br />\nor $1,500 to a penniless family.<br />\nAdditional members of a family<br />\nwould increase the government<br />\n<br />\npayments at a set rate.<br />\nDr. Poole's first choice,<br />\nthough, is an across-the-board tax<br />\nhike and then a set annual return<br />\nto all American families, roughly<br />\nparalleling the Social Security<br />\nprogram. Either procedure would<br />\ncost between $8-10 billion, he<br />\nestimated, but would drastically<br />\nreduce the present welfare<br />\nprogram.<br />\nRecognizes Conservative Currents<br />\nHowever, Dr. Poole is<br />\ncognizant that political realities<br />\nmany times clash with idealistic<br />\ngoals and the present tenor of<br />\nWashington thought is generally<br />\nunfavorable to aid to the poor on<br />\nsuch a sweeping basis.<br />\n\"Conservative elements don't<br />\nlike the idea of income without<br />\nwork, while the liberals are asking<br />\nfor larger government subsidies.\"<br />\nDr. Poole is convinced,<br />\nhowever,that $1,500 minimum is<br />\na just compromise which prevents<br />\ngreat hardships for those working<br />\nwho are not physically or<br />\nmentally capable, but still does<br />\nnot encourage voluntary<br />\nunemployment.<br />\nPeabody Supports Plan<br />\nPoole's concern about<br />\nCongress was shared by Dr.<br />\nRobert C.

The black community is beginning to organize on an unprecedented scale in an attempt to make the decisions<br />\nwhich affect them rather than just abiding by them; students have<br />\nmanned the McCarthy and anti-war campaigns in large numbers; urban governments are urging citizens from all segments of their communities to participate in government. The freshman class this year<br />\nwas welcomed with an Orientation Program sporting the theme of<br />\nurban problems.<br />\nAnother type of participation has become increasingly relevant<br />\nto students \u2014 taking part in the decision-making process of their<br />\nuniversities.

The educational<br />\nestablishment in America \u2014 of which the university is a leading part<br />\n\u2014 is undeniably crucial to the progress and direction of our country.<br />\nParticipation in the decision-making of such an institution is as important a responsibility as voting on election day, working for civil<br />\nrights, or participating in urban affairs as this year's orientation urged.<br />\nConcern with the university and the entire educational structure is not a short-term, four year concern. We reject past statements<br />\nof educators such as Dr. Gordon who refuse to give a substantial voice<br />\nto the students on the grounds that they are temporary \"four year<br />\nresidents.\" Instead, let us say that during the undergraduate years,<br />\nstudents have a unique closeness to the university and a unique opportunity to reform it, one which they may never have again.<br />\nMany colleges and universities have recognized this and have<br />\ngranted students voting power on major committees, be they academic or concerned with auxiliary services.uperating under past president Milton Eisenhower and or.

Reacting<br />\nto this charge in a news conference,<br />\nAgnew made his well publicized<br />\ncry that Humphrey is \"soft on<br />\ncommunism\", soft on a variety of<br />\nother things and in fact, \"squishy<br />\nsoft\". Agnew followed these openers with charges of \"communist<br />\ninfluence\" aimed at certain student activist groups. He was even<br />\ngoing to publish a list of students<br />\nwith \"communist leanings\", lumping Hippies, Yippies, McCarthyites<br />\nand other demonstrators into this<br />\ngroup. He later dropped such<br />\naccusations when certain influential Republicans indicated a strong<br />\ndisagreement with the Governor.<br />\n<br />\nerence to a proposed open housing<br />\nlaw. In the election Agnew shifted<br />\nto a more moderate view, worked<br />\nto win black confidence and collected the support of Maryland's<br />\nliberals, who really had no where<br />\nelse to go. In his victory over<br />\nMahoney, Agnew proved himself<br />\nadept at countering the tactics of a<br />\nfear-provoking racist, a talent<br />\nRichard Nixon could not overlook<br />\nin choosing his running mate for a<br />\nrace against George Wallace.<br />\n<br />\niastic supporters.

His<br />\nsuccess in stealing from Wallace<br />\nmay decide the election.<br />\nWhy is Agnew so qualified to<br />\ncompete for the Wallace vote?<br />\nThe answer lies in his personal and<br />\npolitical life.

The grocer's<br />\nson fought his way up, attended<br />\nHopkins for three years as a Chemistry Major and then transferred to<br />\nthe unaccredited University of<br />\nBaltimore. After U. of B.

However, Agnew's police<br />\nsuppression of the student outbursts was tame compared to his<br />\nreaction to the April riots in<br />\nBaltimore.

The<br />\nclever,smoothtalking new Education Minister, Edgar Faure, had<br />\nalready prepared the ground for<br />\nthe new approach by a speech<br />\ndelivered to Parliament in July<br />\noutlining a program of University<br />\nreform embodying the essential<br />\n<br />\nslogans of the students to engage<br />\nin political debate and discussion<br />\nin the buildings of the University<br />\n\u2014 and thereby caused- consternation in the ranks of his fellowGaullists.

First and foremost,<br />\nchildren from poverty areas<br />\nwithin Baltimore are exposed to a<br />\nWide range of hither-to unknown<br />\nexperiences.<br />\nJust Six Weeks<br />\nJim Archibald, director of the<br />\nSummer Tutorial Program,<br />\nfurther underscored Wickwire's<br />\nstatement concerning the<br />\ninexperience of the tutees by<br />\nsaying that \"realistically, you<br />\ncan't get the kids to learn<br />\nanything substantial in the six to<br />\neight weeks we are with them.<br />\nInstead the tutor must try to<br />\nbuild the tutee's confidence.\" He<br />\nsaid further, that many of the<br />\ntutees came into the program<br />\nWith a real hatred of school,<br />\nteachers, and all they symbolize.<br />\nThis attitude must be changed if<br />\nthe kids are to get anywhere,\"<br />\nadded Archibald.<br />\nThere are indications that the<br />\nProject is a success. For example,<br />\nover 30% of the tutees last<br />\nsummer returned to Hopkins<br />\nfrom previous summer programs.<br />\nDr. Wickwire stated that the<br />\nsecond benefit to be derived from<br />\nthe tutorial program is the<br />\nexperience gained by the tutors<br />\n<br />\nthemselves.-The Hopkins tutor<br />\nworks primarily on a one-to-one<br />\nbasis with his tutee, generally in<br />\nthe home of his student. There is<br />\nalso a considerable effort to<br />\nencourage the parent's interest in<br />\nthe work. In this way the tutor<br />\ncomes to know the family as a<br />\nunit and thus learns a great deal<br />\nabout the ghetto which is not<br />\navailable from text books and<br />\ncourses in urban affairs.<br />\nFall's Work<br />\nThis fall's work will be carried<br />\non in much the same manner as<br />\nthe summer program. There will<br />\nbe one meeting between tutor<br />\nand tutee devoted to studying<br />\nmany of the tutorial aids which<br />\nDr. Shiffern will discuss on Oct.<br />\n12. A recreational program<br />\ninvolving such activities as field<br />\ntrips, dances,and demonstrations<br />\nrelating to areas covered by tutors<br />\nduring study times, will be<br />\nundertaken.<br />\nJim Archibald stated that the<br />\nsummer program did have some<br />\ndifficulty in finding useful<br />\ntutorial materials to which the<br />\ntutees could relate. Many books<br />\npublished by elementary and<br />\nsecondary schools were not<br />\ncompletely satisfactory for they<br />\ndid not mention factors relevant<br />\nto the ghetto community.<br />\nMarkings<br />\nTo remedy this situation<br />\ntutees were encouraged to<br />\nexpress themselves. Once a<br />\nsufficient number of such short<br />\nstories and poems were available<br />\ntutors began to rely on the tutee's<br />\nown writings as a basis for the<br />\nstudy sessions. This collection of<br />\nshort stories and poems has been<br />\npublished by the S.A. under the<br />\ntitle Markings.<br />\n<br />\nRacial Tensions<br />\nWorking in cooperation with<br />\ncommunity leaders, Dr. Chester<br />\nWickwire's Inner City<br />\nEducational Fund continues to<br />\nstrive for an improvement of<br />\nexisting conditions within<br />\nBaltimore's Inner City.<br />\nThe Fund, which was initially<br />\nformed after the death of Martin<br />\nLuther King, in order to prevent<br />\noutbreaks of disease in epidemic<br />\nproportions, presently runs three<br />\nprojects of major consequence in<br />\nthe Inner City.<br />\nDuririg the summer, the Inner<br />\nCity Program allocated funds for<br />\na two-week seminar on interracial<br />\nrelations, under volunteer<br />\nprofessional guidance. Dr.<br />\nJerome Frank and members of<br />\nthe Department of Psychiatry at<br />\nthe Hopkins School of Hygiene<br />\nand Public Health drew volunteers from the out-patient staff<br />\nand, at first, ran two segregated<br />\nseminars designed for both Negroes and White staff members.<br />\nThese initial programs were to<br />\ndraw from general conversation,<br />\nthe basic attitudes of the participants.<br />\n'1'he second stage of Dr.<br />\nFrank's program was a combined,<br />\nNegro-White seminar. At this<br />\npoint, 'Dr. Frank hoped that<br />\nmany of the fears and dislikes<br />\nwould be understood and,<br />\ntherefore, become manageable.<br />\nIn addition to the programs<br />\nbeing carried on at this time, Dr.<br />\nWickwire plans to begin several<br />\ncultural programs in the Inner<br />\nCity. Such programs would<br />\nprovide musical, dramatic, and<br />\nsimilar opportunities.<br />\n<br />\nLevine to Head<br />\nUrban Center<br />\nAfter a year and a half of planning and work, the University is<br />\nalmost ready to announce the<br />\nofficial inauguration of the Hopkins Urban Center.<br />\nRoss Jones, Vice-President of<br />\nUniversity Affairs, reported that<br />\na news conference will probably<br />\nbe held within the next few<br />\nweeks to present the Urban Center and its program to Baltimore.<br />\nThe actual history of the Center stretches back to Dr. Eisenhower's last year as president of<br />\nthe University. At that time, a<br />\ncommittee was appointed to<br />\nstudy the possibility of establishing some kind of urban center at<br />\nHopkins. The committee later<br />\nsubmitted plans for a center that<br />\nwould concentrate primarily on<br />\nresearch and teaching.<br />\nMayor Chides -Hopkins<br />\nThese plans received impetus<br />\nfrom an interchange of remarks<br />\nbetween Mayor D'Allesandro and<br />\nDr. Gordon. At a Chamber of<br />\nCommerce luncheon in<br />\nDecember of 1967, the Mayor<br />\nblamed Hopkins for failing to<br />\nhelp the city as it should. In<br />\nreturn, Dr. Gordon reaffirmed<br />\nthe University's committment to<br />\nan urban center at his<br />\ninauguration in February of<br />\n1968. At this point, the<br />\nUniversity had already appointed<br />\nDr. Sol Levin9\u2018of the'School of<br />\nPublic Health and Hygiene to<br />\nhead the center.<br />\nDr. Levine recruited several<br />\nadditional people to fill out his<br />\nstaff and he proposed that the<br />\nCenter have offices at both the<br />\nHomewood and Hospital<br />\ncampuses.<br />\n<br />\nJohn Guess<br />\n<br />\nS.A.

They plan to recruit<br />\nstudents to staff research teams<br />\nand a speakers bureau.<br />\nJoe Weinberg, president of the<br />\nSA,admitted that such a program<br />\nwould be very difficult to start,<br />\nbut he felt that the need for<br />\neducating white people about<br />\nblacks in the inner city was<br />\ncrucial and that this was one of<br />\nthe best opportunities for<br />\nHopkins and Baltimore to help<br />\neach other.<br />\nTradition<br />\nThe SA plans to continue<br />\nsome of its traditional programs<br />\nsuch as the campus lecture series.<br />\nThis year speakers are being<br />\nscheduled for a series on political<br />\npersonalities, on problems and<br />\ninstitutions of Baltimore and on<br />\nnew ideas in theology.

Periodically, art<br />\nexhibits will be featured in the<br />\nSherwood Room of Levering.<br />\nWeinberg was generally<br />\noptimistic about the SA's<br />\nprospects for the year, but he<br />\nnoted two immediate problems.<br />\nThe SA will need a much larger<br />\nnumber of active members than it<br />\nhas at present, and it is still<br />\nunknown how, or if, the student<br />\nbody will respond to this need.<br />\nIn addition, the SA will need<br />\ngreater financial resources and is<br />\ninvestigating several sources for<br />\nmore funds.<br />\nhoped. For this reason, the fund<br />\nraising period has been extended<br />\nand federal funds will be sought<br />\nonce the center begins<br />\noperations.<br />\nThe original purposes of the<br />\ncenter have been expanded and it<br />\nwill now focus much of its<br />\nattention on the particular<br />\nproblems of Baltimore. The<br />\nCenter will also attempt to<br />\ncoordinate to some degree the<br />\nwide range of urban-related<br />\n\"activities within the University.<br />\n<br />\nThe attitude of the Hopkin's<br />\ncommunity towards the Black<br />\nStudent Union and its aims will<br />\ndetermine the role which that<br />\ngroup will seek to fulfill within<br />\nthe university, its leaders<br />\nmaintained in their first policy<br />\nstatement of the year.<br />\nWhen questioned about the<br />\nfunction of the black group,<br />\nBruce Baker and John Guess,<br />\nspokesmen for the group,<br />\nanswered that the association will<br />\n\"attempt to deal on the student<br />\nlevel with the problems of race<br />\nrelations at Hopkins and within<br />\nthe Baltimore community.\"<br />\nThe organization, still in its<br />\nformative stage, will attempt to<br />\nestablish rapport with the<br />\nfaculty, the administration, and<br />\nany other campus groups which<br />\nwould help in furthering the<br />\nUnion's aims.<br />\nWill Help Negro Students<br />\nThe Union seeks to facilitate<br />\nthe entry of Negro students into<br />\nthe university and the university<br />\ncommunity. Moreover, it will<br />\nattempt to impart a sense of back<br />\nawareness to the student once he<br />\nis matriculated, providing him<br />\nwith an organ capable of<br />\ncorrecting any grievances which<br />\nhe might have.<br />\nSpeaking of the situation as it<br />\nnow stands, Bruce Baker<br />\nmaintained thal \"the number of<br />\nblack students in the freshman<br />\nclass falls far short of our<br />\nexpectations and underscores the<br />\nneed for more work in the area of<br />\nstudent admissions.\"<br />\nJohn Guess elaborated on the<br />\nwork to be done.\"We want, first<br />\n,of all, to increase the number of<br />\nblack undergraduates at Hopkins,<br />\nincrease their level of Negro participation in the administration,<br />\nand encourage black students<br />\nwho are now in graduate school<br />\nto apply for positions on the<br />\nHopkins faculty. This must serve<br />\nas a basis for further action to be<br />\neffective.\"<br />\nThe union also wants its<br />\nmembers to take a greater role in<br />\nsuch community action projects<br />\nas tutoring, social research, etc.<br />\nThese activities must include<br />\nworking within the various social<br />\nservice groups which have been<br />\nformed on campus, as well as<br />\ncoordinated efforts with<br />\nBaltimore agencies and other<br />\nschools.<br />\n\"Our aims include the<br />\nformation and maintainance of<br />\nstrong relationships with the<br />\nblack schools in the area and with<br />\nblack students who attend<br />\npredominatedly white<br />\ninstitutions such as Goucher,<br />\nNotre Dame and Mount Saint<br />\nAgnes.

Mr. Ball pointed<br />\nout that \"the teachers in the Pilot<br />\nProgram encourage them to be<br />\ncreative with their hands and<br />\nminds, not just to get the work<br />\ndone.\"<br />\nSimilar to the Pilot Project is<br />\nthe Neighborhood Youth<br />\nProgram sponsored by the<br />\nHopkins School of Hygiene and<br />\nPublic Health.

Everything<br />\nfrom balance of trade to political<br />\norientation will be influenced by<br />\nthe lack of available food.<br />\nBy 1983 the world population<br />\nwill reach 4.5 billion compared to<br />\npresent population estimates of<br />\n<br />\nabout 3.4 billion. Considering<br />\nnormal progress in agriculture, at<br />\nthis point in time the world will<br />\nsimply be unable to support that<br />\nmany living creatures.<br />\n\"In nature,\" McElroy said,<br />\n\"no animal, plant, or bacterial<br />\npopulation has ever maintained a<br />\nlogrithmic phase of growth for<br />\nvery long. The major factors that<br />\nslow this rate of growth are<br />\nexhaustion of food supply,<br />\naccumulation of toxic products,<br />\ndecimation through disease, or<br />\nthe effects of some outside lethal<br />\nagent which kills a high<br />\nproportion of the population...I<br />\nleave it to your imagination<br />\nwhich of these factors might<br />\napply to the human population.\"<br />\nBirth Control<br />\nThe recent encyclical of Pope<br />\nPaul VI compounds the problem,<br />\nsaid Dr. McElroy \"It is entirely<br />\ncontrary to all we know in<br />\nbiology.\" In the less educated<br />\ncountries the effect will be<br />\ntremendous and dangerous.

But<br />\neven Coach Alex Sotir's '68 gridmen may be hard put to match<br />\nlast year's impressive record of six<br />\nvictories to one defeat. The statistics read like Vince Lombardi's<br />\ndiary. In three games the Jays<br />\nscored over 50 points and four<br />\ntimes held the opposition to six<br />\nor less, with one shutout performance against Ursinus.<br />\nBackfire<br />\nIn the true Coach's tradition<br />\nSotir is cautiously optimistic: \"We<br />\nhave to work on the offense playing ball control. Obviously the<br />\nmore chances our backs have with<br />\nthe ball the more of a chance they<br />\nhave to break away.\"<br />\nThe Jays retain the same explosive backfield as last year. Jim<br />\nFeely, the southpaw, will lead<br />\nthe offense at quarterback. Behim powerful Mark Croft will run<br />\nin the fullback slot. Fans won't<br />\nbe surprised to find Joe Cowan<br />\nback; he's still number 25, and<br />\nhe's playing at wingback. Junior<br />\nPaul. Weiss holds down the other<br />\nhalfback position.<br />\nThe two keys for this season<br />\nare size and sophs. The defensive<br />\ntackles are awesome. Few will get<br />\naround or through Kenny Brown<br />\nor Witt Holden, who are weighing in at 238 and 260 respectively.<br />\nThe defense is led by scrappy cocaptain Willie Scroggs at halfback.<br />\nThere's also plenty of muscle<br />\nin an offensive line which averages<br />\n200 pounds, and is anchored by<br />\nco-captain Don Yablonowitz at<br />\nguard. In a rugged schedule nine<br />\ngame this season, depth can make<br />\nthe difference. This could be the<br />\n. Jays' greatest liability. However,<br />\nseventeen sophomores made the<br />\nteam, permitting Coach Sotir to<br />\n?play the platoon system.<br />\nThe season kicks off against<br />\nMuhlenberg, a team which euphemistically calls themselves the<br />\nMules.

Former<br />\nPoly standout Bernie Wenker is<br />\nbidding strongly for a starting<br />\nspot in the line. Others of ability<br />\ninclude senior Dennis McCartney<br />\n(halfback) and soph goalie Steve<br />\nWeiss and backs Scott, Mittman,<br />\nMakransky and Rowes.

Critics of the<br />\nViolence Commission have said<br />\nthat setting up a commission such<br />\nas yours after the death of Robert<br />\nKennedy is \"the kind of things<br />\npresidents do when they don't<br />\nknow what else to do.\" The tack<br />\nthat a lot of the criticism has<br />\ntaken is that the Commission was<br />\nestablished by the President to assure the people that some thing<br />\nwas being done about a tragic situation. What is your reaction?<br />\nEISENHOWER \u2014 If the Commission did a quick, superficial job, it<br />\nwould certainly make no contribution to the President, the Congress,<br />\nand the American people. In that<br />\ncase, the charges you have seen by<br />\nsome columnists (would be justified. I hope we don't do that kind<br />\nof work. We have brought together some of the finest psychiatrists,<br />\npsychologists, sociologists, neurologists, historians, criminologists<br />\nin the country to examine the<br />\nvarious aspects of violence: assasination, individual acts of violence,<br />\nsuch as homicide, and third, group<br />\nviolence. And we have as scholarly<br />\ntask forces in these three areas as<br />\none could possibly bring together.<br />\nThen we have task forces on<br />\nthe influence on the mass media,<br />\non gun control, on the legal aspects of the entire probelm - both arrest, conviction and sentencing. And finally a task force,<br />\ninvolving, incidentally a Hopkins<br />\nscholar, on sort of a sociological<br />\nand historical aspect of violence,<br />\nwhich may be very revealing. If<br />\none compares the whole history of<br />\nviolence in the United States with<br />\nthat of Great Britian, Germany.<br />\nand France, let us say this may be<br />\nvery revealing.<br />\nThe problem is, we have promised to file the President at least<br />\na preliminary report at least by<br />\nDecember 31, if possible, or just<br />\nbefore he leaves office.

The statistical evidence is frightening. Why is<br />\nit that we have 60 times as many<br />\nmurders per hundred-thousand<br />\npopulation in this\u2022country as they<br />\ndo in Great Britian? We know the<br />\nfacts, but I'm afraid that when<br />\none seeks to determine the causes<br />\nof the degree of violence in this<br />\ncountry, the reasons given are<br />\nmere pre-conceptions, and are not<br />\nbased on the kind of hard evidence<br />\nthat I hope we can bring together.<br />\nWe know a great deal about how<br />\nmuch violence there is, but not<br />\nabout what the real causes are. I<br />\nthink that is what we have to find<br />\nout and that is what the commission is working on.<br />\nN-L \u2014 What the gist of the criticisms seem to be, and the point<br />\nI'm getting at, is that it can be<br />\ncharged that the establishment of<br />\na commission was for \"show\" - -<br /><br />\nto assure people that the assassination of Robert Kennedy was not<br />\nleaving us helpless as tO solutions.<br />\nEISENHOWER \u2014 I want to say<br />\nthat I personally wouldn't be connected with it if it were only a<br />\n\"show.\" I would have no inducement, politically or otherwise, to<br />\nmake a show for a Democratic<br />\nPresident.<br />\nMay I say that the commission<br />\nitself is a very good cross section<br />\nof high-level America. Judge Higginbotham, a black man and judge<br />\nfrom Philadelphia,is absolutely superb. Mrs. Harris,a woman lawyer,<br />\na Negro woman and former ambassador, is superb. Archbishop<br />\nCooke, Hoffer, the labor longshoreman from California, and so<br />\non. It's a good commission. I'm<br />\nsure no member of the commission<br />\nhas any intention of making a<br />\n\"show.\"<br />\nI'm sure no member of this<br />\ncommission would be at work<br />\nmerely as sort of a soothing balm<br />\nto the public for a very tragic<br />\nthing that occurred.<br />\nN-L \u2014 Then, as to the criticism,<br />\nit seems like it would be bound<br />\nto happen with any Presidential<br />\nappointment, that people would<br />\nturn it into a political question. It<br />\nwas suggested that the reason the<br />\nCommission is looking into Chicago is because President Johnson<br />\nwanted to forestall any kind of<br />\ndamaging congressional investigation.<br />\nEISENHOWER \u2014 Well, I didn't<br />\ntalk to President Johnson. The<br />\ncharter \u2014 the executive order<br />\nthat brought our commission into<br />\nbeing is so broad that we had ample authority to do this, but to<br />\nshow you that our study of the<br />\nChicago situation has no possible<br />\npolitical implication is that we<br />\nwill not report on that before<br />\nNovember 5.<br />\nN-L \u2014 Another problem with<br />\nPresidential commissions is that in<br /><br />\nGAUGUIN<br />\na psychiatrist who<br />\nwas retained by the Kennedy Administration to analyze Khrushchev's mind, explains that his<br />\nfindings were pretty exact, with<br />\none exception.

We also seem<br />\nto have more violence motivated<br />\nby political and ideplogical issues?<br />\nIs this new?<br />\nEISENHOWER \u2014 Again, I would<br />\nbe drawing conclusions if I stated<br />\nthat. I may say that I am deeply<br />\nconcerned about the tremendous<br />\ngrowth - - just drawing a crude figure out of the air - - of violence<br />\nwhich has increased about 70% in<br />\nthe last six or seven years.<br />\nThere are some new things in<br />\nthis violence - - and this is merely<br />\nfactual and not drawing a conclusion: violence on the campus is<br />\nnew. Now, it's true throughout<br />\nour history, the New York draft<br /><br />\nmost is time. If we had three years,<br />\nin which to do the most scientific<br />\npossible job, I would then be<br />\nthoroughly confident that we<br />\ncould come up with a report that<br />\nwould be of value to the President, the Congress, and the American people.<br />\nWho knows? This may happen.<br />\nI rather think that on the basis of<br />\nwhatever evidence we have now,<br />\nthat further research is needed. I<br />\nmean very serious research. It may<br />\nbe that one of the recommendations that our commission will<br />\nmake is that the National Science<br />\nFoundation and the National Institute of Health really give top<br />\npriority to research in this area.<br />\nN-L \u2014 Going back to violence on<br />\nthe campus. As a former university<br />\npresident, how would you have<br />\nhandled the uprising at Columbia<br />\nlast spring?<br />\nEISENHOWER \u2014 No, I'm not going to second-guess Grayson Kirk.<br />\nI think that one would have to<br />\nhave lived on the Columbia campus, been a part of the Columbia<br />\nfamily, to know whether the difficulty went back many years or<br />\nwhether it was an unexpected<br />\nsituation that no one could have<br />\ncontrolled.

I certainly don't think it's justified. I can't<br />\nthink of any other place in the<br />\nworld which is as open to the free<br />\nforces of consultation and discussion to settle disputes.<br />\nIf we are going to resort to violence on the campus, it would<br />\nseem to me that this would foreshadow anarchy in the United<br />\nStates.

Three-hundred Columbia seniors walked out of the official graduation and marched to the<br />\nrump graduation.<br />\nDuring the Spring strike, a<br />\nminority group walked out of the<br />\nColumbia Strike Coordinating<br />\nCommittee and formed the Students for a Reconstructed University (SRU). The SRU seeks radical<br />\nreforms within the University,<br />\nignoring the effects that the rest<br />\nof the society and the power<br />\nstructure might have in preventing<br />\nsuch changes.

The dominant attitude<br />\n_among students is that they would<br />\nlike to get in a semester of school<br />\nbefore again tackling the power<br />\nstructure.<br />\nSummer Action<br />\nDuring the summer, the Strike<br />\nCommittee ran a Liberation<br />\nSchool in a fraternity house across<br />\nthe street from the Campus. About<br />\n500 students, from Columbia and<br />\nother colleges, high schools and<br />\nthe surrounding community attended the more than twenty<br />\ncourses offered.<br />\nMany courses took the form of<br />\nResearch/Action Projects.

His<br />\nsupport ofthe guaranteed income<br />\nis based on the following<br />\nassumptions: our country is<br />\nwealthy enough to allow none of<br />\nits citizens to starve,regardless of<br />\nwhether they work or not;<br />\neconomic incentives must be<br />\npresent to encourage the<br />\nunemployed to work; and our<br />\nnation is based on personal<br />\nfreedom which prohibits direct<br />\nsupervision of individual lives by<br />\nany organization.<br />\nThe Economics professor<br />\nstated that the present welfare<br />\nsystem accomplishes none of<br />\nthese objectives.<br />\n\"It destroys initiative by<br />\nreducing welfare payments when<br />\nthe recipient earns income.<br />\nToday any earnings above $30 a<br />\nmonth reduces the welfare check<br />\nby $1 for each $1 earned, or,in<br />\nother words, it is a 100% tax.<br />\nThese traditional techniques are<br />\ndegrading and destroy individual<br />\nincentive and hope.\"<br />\nSupports Negative Invome Tax<br />\nDr. Poole sees two plans as<br />\nholding the most promise in<br />\nhandling this federal dole,<br />\nalthough there are other<br />\nalternatives. One idea that has<br />\ngained Dr. Poole's support was<br />\nproposed by Dr. Milton Friedman<br />\nof the University of Chicago. His<br />\nplan would employ the $3,000 of<br />\npersonal exemptions and<br />\ndeductions for a four member<br />\nfamily now used by the federal<br />\nincome tax as the standard for<br />\nproviding annual income.<br />\nIf a family of four earned<br />\n$2,000, for example, the<br />\ndifference between this sum and<br />\nthe $3,000 figure would be<br />\nassessed at maybe 50%,therefore<br />\nadding. $500 to the earned<br />\nincome. This so-called \"negative<br />\nincome tax\" would yield then,<br />\nusing this system, half of$3,000,<br />\nor $1,500 to a penniless family.<br />\nAdditional members of a family<br />\nwould increase the government<br /><br />\npayments at a set rate.<br />\nDr. Poole's first choice,<br />\nthough, is an across-the-board tax<br />\nhike and then a set annual return<br />\nto all American families, roughly<br />\nparalleling the Social Security<br />\nprogram. Either procedure would<br />\ncost between $8-10 billion, he<br />\nestimated, but would drastically<br />\nreduce the present welfare<br />\nprogram.<br />\nRecognizes Conservative Currents<br />\nHowever, Dr. Poole is<br />\ncognizant that political realities<br />\nmany times clash with idealistic<br />\ngoals and the present tenor of<br />\nWashington thought is generally<br />\nunfavorable to aid to the poor on<br />\nsuch a sweeping basis.<br />\n\"Conservative elements don't<br />\nlike the idea of income without<br />\nwork, while the liberals are asking<br />\nfor larger government subsidies.\"<br />\nDr. Poole is convinced,<br />\nhowever,that $1,500 minimum is<br />\na just compromise which prevents<br />\ngreat hardships for those working<br />\nwho are not physically or<br />\nmentally capable, but still does<br />\nnot encourage voluntary<br />\nunemployment.<br />\nPeabody Supports Plan<br />\nPoole's concern about<br />\nCongress was shared by Dr.<br />\nRobert C. Peabody, a Hopkins<br />\nlegislative expert in the Political<br />\nScience Department. Dr.<br />\nPeabody stated that it will take a<br />\nnumber of years before there is a<br />\nsubstantial enough consensus<br />\namong Congressional members to<br />\nenact a guaranteed income.

The black community is beginning to organize on an unprecedented scale in an attempt to make the decisions<br />\nwhich affect them rather than just abiding by them; students have<br />\nmanned the McCarthy and anti-war campaigns in large numbers; urban governments are urging citizens from all segments of their communities to participate in government. The freshman class this year<br />\nwas welcomed with an Orientation Program sporting the theme of<br />\nurban problems.<br />\nAnother type of participation has become increasingly relevant<br />\nto students \u2014 taking part in the decision-making process of their<br />\nuniversities. In this area as well the freshmen were welcomed on a distinct note \u2014 President Lincoln Gordon zeroing in on creeping<br />\n\"anarchism.\"<br />\nIf this is a year of participation, we should establish one basic<br />\npremise concerning participation in university affairs. The educational<br />\nestablishment in America \u2014 of which the university is a leading part<br />\n\u2014 is undeniably crucial to the progress and direction of our country.<br />\nParticipation in the decision-making of such an institution is as important a responsibility as voting on election day, working for civil<br />\nrights, or participating in urban affairs as this year's orientation urged.<br />\nConcern with the university and the entire educational structure is not a short-term, four year concern. We reject past statements<br />\nof educators such as Dr. Gordon who refuse to give a substantial voice<br />\nto the students on the grounds that they are temporary \"four year<br />\nresidents.\" Instead, let us say that during the undergraduate years,<br />\nstudents have a unique closeness to the university and a unique opportunity to reform it, one which they may never have again.<br />\nMany colleges and universities have recognized this and have<br />\ngranted students voting power on major committees, be they academic or concerned with auxiliary services.uperating under past president Milton Eisenhower and or.

Reacting<br />\nto this charge in a news conference,<br />\nAgnew made his well publicized<br />\ncry that Humphrey is \"soft on<br />\ncommunism\", soft on a variety of<br />\nother things and in fact, \"squishy<br />\nsoft\". Agnew followed these openers with charges of \"communist<br />\ninfluence\" aimed at certain student activist groups. He was even<br />\ngoing to publish a list of students<br />\nwith \"communist leanings\", lumping Hippies, Yippies, McCarthyites<br />\nand other demonstrators into this<br />\ngroup. He later dropped such<br />\naccusations when certain influential Republicans indicated a strong<br />\ndisagreement with the Governor.<br /><br />\nerence to a proposed open housing<br />\nlaw. In the election Agnew shifted<br />\nto a more moderate view, worked<br />\nto win black confidence and collected the support of Maryland's<br />\nliberals, who really had no where<br />\nelse to go. In his victory over<br />\nMahoney, Agnew proved himself<br />\nadept at countering the tactics of a<br />\nfear-provoking racist, a talent<br />\nRichard Nixon could not overlook<br />\nin choosing his running mate for a<br />\nrace against George Wallace.<br /><br />\niastic supporters.

His<br />\nsuccess in stealing from Wallace<br />\nmay decide the election.<br />\nWhy is Agnew so qualified to<br />\ncompete for the Wallace vote?<br />\nThe answer lies in his personal and<br />\npolitical life. Agnew's father was a<br />\nGreek immigrant who over the<br />\nyears established two Baltimore<br />\nrestaurants. When the depression<br />\nstruck, the elder Agnew was forced to sell groceries. The grocer's<br />\nson fought his way up, attended<br />\nHopkins for three years as a Chemistry Major and then transferred to<br />\nthe unaccredited University of<br />\nBaltimore. After U. of B.

However, Agnew's police<br />\nsuppression of the student outbursts was tame compared to his<br />\nreaction to the April riots in<br />\nBaltimore. Following the riots,<br />\nAgnew assembled a group whom<br />\nhe chose to label as black moderates (everyone to the right of the<br />\nNAACP) and spent an enlightening half an hour waving a finger at<br />\nthese \"dupes for the outside<br />\nagitators and criminal elements\"<br />\nwho were so obviously responsible<br />\nfor the distrubances following the<br />\ndeath of Dr. King.

The<br />\nclever,smoothtalking new Education Minister, Edgar Faure, had<br />\nalready prepared the ground for<br />\nthe new approach by a speech<br />\ndelivered to Parliament in July<br />\noutlining a program of University<br />\nreform embodying the essential<br /><br />\nslogans of the students to engage<br />\nin political debate and discussion<br />\nin the buildings of the University<br />\n\u2014 and thereby caused- consternation in the ranks of his fellowGaullists.

Dr.<br />\nJerome Frank and members of<br />\nthe Department of Psychiatry at<br />\nthe Hopkins School of Hygiene<br />\nand Public Health drew volunteers from the out-patient staff<br />\nand, at first, ran two segregated<br />\nseminars designed for both Negroes and White staff members.<br />\nThese initial programs were to<br />\ndraw from general conversation,<br />\nthe basic attitudes of the participants.<br />\n'1'he second stage of Dr.<br />\nFrank's program was a combined,<br />\nNegro-White seminar.

At that time, a<br />\ncommittee was appointed to<br />\nstudy the possibility of establishing some kind of urban center at<br />\nHopkins. The committee later<br />\nsubmitted plans for a center that<br />\nwould concentrate primarily on<br />\nresearch and teaching.<br />\nMayor Chides -Hopkins<br />\nThese plans received impetus<br />\nfrom an interchange of remarks<br />\nbetween Mayor D'Allesandro and<br />\nDr. Gordon. At a Chamber of<br />\nCommerce luncheon in<br />\nDecember of 1967, the Mayor<br />\nblamed Hopkins for failing to<br />\nhelp the city as it should. In<br />\nreturn, Dr. Gordon reaffirmed<br />\nthe University's committment to<br />\nan urban center at his<br />\ninauguration in February of<br />\n1968. At this point, the<br />\nUniversity had already appointed<br />\nDr. Sol Levin9\u2018of the'School of<br />\nPublic Health and Hygiene to<br />\nhead the center.<br />\nDr. Levine recruited several<br />\nadditional people to fill out his<br />\nstaff and he proposed that the<br />\nCenter have offices at both the<br />\nHomewood and Hospital<br />\ncampuses.<br /><br />\nJohn Guess<br /><br />\nS.A.

Moreover, it will<br />\nattempt to impart a sense of back<br />\nawareness to the student once he<br />\nis matriculated, providing him<br />\nwith an organ capable of<br />\ncorrecting any grievances which<br />\nhe might have.<br />\nSpeaking of the situation as it<br />\nnow stands, Bruce Baker<br />\nmaintained thal \"the number of<br />\nblack students in the freshman<br />\nclass falls far short of our<br />\nexpectations and underscores the<br />\nneed for more work in the area of<br />\nstudent admissions.\"<br />\nJohn Guess elaborated on the<br />\nwork to be done.\"We want, first<br />\n,of all, to increase the number of<br />\nblack undergraduates at Hopkins,<br />\nincrease their level of Negro participation in the administration,<br />\nand encourage black students<br />\nwho are now in graduate school<br />\nto apply for positions on the<br />\nHopkins faculty.

He proposed<br />\na series of .coffee hours in the<br />\ndormitory for students, faculty<br />\nand administrators, and a<br />\nprogram of monthly luncheons to<br />\nstudent leaders and<br />\nwhich<br />\nuniversity officials would be<br />\ninvited.<br />\nLectures<br />\nPassarella said that major<br />\nlectures on campus, which were<br />\nscarce last year, would be<br />\nimproved.

It will appoint students<br />\nto all major university committees except the Academic Council. The SC plans to combine its<br />\nown curriculum studies and calendar reforms committees in an<br />\nattempt to make a serious effort<br />\nat revising the University<br />\ncalendar, a project which has<br />\ninvariably come to a dead-end in<br />\nprevious years.<br />\nAdmissions Council<br />\nPassarella also hopes that the<br />\nCouncil will approve the<br />\nformation of an Admissions<br />\nCouncil, a program designed by<br />\nnon-council members Abe<br />\nKronsberg and John Guess, which<br />\nwould give undergraduates an<br />\nactive role in recruiting new<br />\nstudents.<br />\nConcerts<br />\nPassarella did not think that<br />\nStudent Council sponsorship of<br />\none or two concerts was a sign of<br />\ngreat achievement, but he said<br />\nthat the Council would improve<br />\nthe scheduling of dances and<br />\nconcerts.<br />\n\"There will be no more split<br />\nweekends,\" he stated adding that<br />\nthe social committee would be<br />\ngiven full authority for major<br />\nsocial events.<br />\nSo far six major dances have<br />\nbeen scheduled for the year.<br />\nConcerts include the Serendipity<br />\nSingers (in a special orientation<br />\nconcert sponsored by the Student<br />\nCouncil),Charlie Byrd(to be held<br />\nafter the F&amp;M football game),<br />\nand Sergio Mendes (the Big Fall<br />\nWeekend Concert).<br />\nFinances<br />\nThe prospects for financing<br />\nStudent Council activities look<br />\nmuch brighter.

Everything<br />\nfrom balance of trade to political<br />\norientation will be influenced by<br />\nthe lack of available food.<br />\nBy 1983 the world population<br />\nwill reach 4.5 billion compared to<br />\npresent population estimates of<br /><br />\nabout 3.4 billion. Considering<br />\nnormal progress in agriculture, at<br />\nthis point in time the world will<br />\nsimply be unable to support that<br />\nmany living creatures.<br />\n\"In nature,\" McElroy said,<br />\n\"no animal, plant, or bacterial<br />\npopulation has ever maintained a<br />\nlogrithmic phase of growth for<br />\nvery long. The major factors that<br />\nslow this rate of growth are<br />\nexhaustion of food supply,<br />\naccumulation of toxic products,<br />\ndecimation through disease, or<br />\nthe effects of some outside lethal<br />\nagent which kills a high<br />\nproportion of the population...I<br />\nleave it to your imagination<br />\nwhich of these factors might<br />\napply to the human population.\"<br />\nBirth Control<br />\nThe recent encyclical of Pope<br />\nPaul VI compounds the problem,<br />\nsaid Dr. McElroy \"It is entirely<br />\ncontrary to all we know in<br />\nbiology.\" In the less educated<br />\ncountries the effect will be<br />\ntremendous and dangerous. The<br />\neffect of prolonging life through<br />\nbetter medicine and advanced<br />\nsurgery and infancy techniques<br />\nadds to the problem.<br />\nFurthermore, if the problem<br />\nof population growth is the<br />\nnumber two problem of the<br />\nworld, then it certainly must be<br />\nplaced along side the number one<br />\nproblem\u2014namely the search for<br />\nlasting peace.<br />\n\"It needs the same status and<br />\nthe same amount of money.

But<br />\neven Coach Alex Sotir's '68 gridmen may be hard put to match<br />\nlast year's impressive record of six<br />\nvictories to one defeat. The statistics read like Vince Lombardi's<br />\ndiary. In three games the Jays<br />\nscored over 50 points and four<br />\ntimes held the opposition to six<br />\nor less, with one shutout performance against Ursinus.<br />\nBackfire<br />\nIn the true Coach's tradition<br />\nSotir is cautiously optimistic: \"We<br />\nhave to work on the offense playing ball control. Obviously the<br />\nmore chances our backs have with<br />\nthe ball the more of a chance they<br />\nhave to break away.\"<br />\nThe Jays retain the same explosive backfield as last year. Jim<br />\nFeely, the southpaw, will lead<br />\nthe offense at quarterback. Behim powerful Mark Croft will run<br />\nin the fullback slot. Fans won't<br />\nbe surprised to find Joe Cowan<br />\nback; he's still number 25, and<br />\nhe's playing at wingback. Junior<br />\nPaul. Weiss holds down the other<br />\nhalfback position.<br />\nThe two keys for this season<br />\nare size and sophs. The defensive<br />\ntackles are awesome. Few will get<br />\naround or through Kenny Brown<br />\nor Witt Holden, who are weighing in at 238 and 260 respectively.<br />\nThe defense is led by scrappy cocaptain Willie Scroggs at halfback.<br />\nThere's also plenty of muscle<br />\nin an offensive line which averages<br />\n200 pounds, and is anchored by<br />\nco-captain Don Yablonowitz at<br />\nguard. In a rugged schedule nine<br />\ngame this season, depth can make<br />\nthe difference. This could be the<br />\n. Jays' greatest liability. However,<br />\nseventeen sophomores made the<br />\nteam, permitting Coach Sotir to<br />\n?play the platoon system.<br />\nThe season kicks off against<br />\nMuhlenberg, a team which euphemistically calls themselves the<br />\nMules.

Former<br />\nPoly standout Bernie Wenker is<br />\nbidding strongly for a starting<br />\nspot in the line. Others of ability<br />\ninclude senior Dennis McCartney<br />\n(halfback) and soph goalie Steve<br />\nWeiss and backs Scott, Mittman,<br />\nMakransky and Rowes.
