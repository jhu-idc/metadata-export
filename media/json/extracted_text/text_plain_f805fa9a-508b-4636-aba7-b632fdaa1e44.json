The week marks the<br />\nevolution from \"a group that<br />\npractically did not exist when I<br />\n<br />\ncame\u2014 to Hopkins in 1987,\"<br />\norganizer Stephen Kent Jusick<br />\nsaid. \"Since then, we have increased our membership and<br />\nvisibility, and after having a certain amount of success last year,<br />\nwe felt that we finally had the<br />\nleadership and support to have a<br />\nweek full of programs.\"<br />\nOrganizer Erik Newton also<br />\nsaid that because it was the first<br />\nAwareness Week at Hopkins,<br />\ngood planning was critical. -That<br />\nis the reason why we have 21<br />\nevents prepared, and we hope to<br />\nget additional funding and support from the University,\" he<br />\nsaid.

Some people urged the student community to accept their<br />\ndifferences, while others spoke of<br />\ntheir family and friends' reactions<br />\nwhen they revealed their sexual<br />\npreferences.

In the relatively short<br />\nperiod of two years, the program<br />\nhas achieved phenomenal success, according to the program's<br />\ndirector, Professor of History<br />\nJudith Walkowitz.<br />\nThe Women's Studies minor<br />\nwas formed as a result of increasing demand from students for formal recognition for their<br />\ncoursework, Walkowitz said.<br />\nWalkowitz, who was a founder<br />\nof the Women's Studies Program<br />\nat Rutgers University, assumed<br />\nher role as director only last fall.<br />\nShe said that it is easier to make<br />\na difference at Hopkins because<br />\nit is such a small place compared<br />\nto Rutgers, which has a student<br />\nbody of more than three thou-<br />\n<br />\nsand. However, Hopkins has<br />\nbeen \"tardy and very cautious\"<br />\nabout implementing the Women's<br />\nStudies Program, she said.<br />\nThe current program is the<br />\nculmination of ten years of persistence and work by Hopkins<br />\nfaculty members like Mary<br />\nPoovy, Professor of English.<br />\nPoovy, as acting director of the<br />\nprogram, set things in motion in<br />\nthe fall of 1989, with the introduction of four courses that<br />\nwere cross-listed in the Women's<br />\nStudies department.<br />\nThe number of courses offered<br />\nhas grown to fifty in two years,<br />\nwith twenty-one courses being<br />\ntaught this semester.

She said that the<br />\nprogram is sustained mainly by<br />\ninterest since it is primarily funded by other departments, including History, English,<br />\nSociology, and Anthropology<br />\nwhich are willing to cross-list<br />\nsome courses in the Department<br />\nof Women's Studies.<br />\nThe program's only other<br />\nsource of funds is a $150,000<br />\ngrant from the Ford Foundation.<br />\nThe grant allows the department<br />\nto sponsor five $2000 fellowships<br />\nfor travel or research related to<br />\nWomen's Studies.<br />\nCourses in Women's Studies<br />\nconcentrate on the \"activities,<br />\npractices, and experiences of<br />\nwomen in history and contemporary society,\" according to<br />\nWalkowitz. Courses also explore<br />\n\"the dynamics of gender relation,<br />\nthe construction of masculinity<br />\nand femininity ideals by society,\"<br />\nshe said.<br />\nOne-third of courses focus on<br />\nwomen's studies specifically,<br />\nwhile the remainder incorporate<br />\nit as a principal component.<br />\nWalkowitz says that the program<br />\nprovides \"a meeting place\" for<br />\na variety of disciplines and points<br />\nof views.<br />\nRequirements for the minor are<br />\nsix one-semester courses, including at least four upper-level<br />\ncourses. Students must also<br />\nchoose these courses from the<br />\nSocial Sciences as well as the<br />\nHumanities area.<br />\nAccording to Walkowitz, the<br />\nmain objective of the program is<br />\nan \"attempt to restore visibility<br />\nto Women's Studies.\" She hopes<br />\nthat the program will change the<br />\natmosphere of the University to<br />\na certain extent, offering students<br />\nan alternative intellectual and<br />\ncultural community.<br />\n<br />\nTuition Keeps Climbing<br />\n$1 6,000<br />\n<br />\n$1 4,000<br />\n<br />\nday's tearing down of a GALA<br />\nbanner, specifically created for<br />\n$1 2,000<br />\nAwareness Week, as an example.<br />\n\"It was a premeditated act by<br />\n$1 0,000<br />\nsome Hopkins students, and it's<br />\na petty way of trying to<br />\ndiscourage us.

Barrett believes that this<br />\ndemonstrates to professors the<br />\nimpact they can have upon their<br />\nstudents and sees it as a positive<br />\nincentive for faculty members to<br />\nwork harder.<br />\nWilliam Busa of the Department of Biology, also nominated,<br />\nto be recognized, stated that<br />\n\"most universities have few<br />\nmechanisms for professors to<br />\nassess the effects of their<br />\nteaching,\" and that it can often<br />\nbe \"unrewarding\" when they<br />\nwork hard at teaching well. Often<br />\ntimes, students do not realize that<br />\ntheir professors are accessible, or<br />\nthe students are too timid to approach them directly. Busa expressed his hope that having a<br />\nFaculty Appreciation Week will<br />\nhelp make professors more open-<br />\n<br />\nContinued from page 1<br />\nseems that the administration is<br />\nsincere in its efforts and is beginning to loosen up.\"<br />\nAlthough he has not had any<br />\nformal protests yet, Newton<br />\nspeculated that more controversial events later in the week might<br />\nprovoke some strong responses.<br />\n\"I expect there will be a lot of<br />\nreaction at the discussion about<br />\nhomophobia and the American<br />\nmilitary,\" he said.<br />\nThere were some who found<br />\nthe posters for Awareness Week<br />\nunnerving, especially one in<br />\nAMR II and the entrance of<br />\n<br />\nly accessible to students, and both<br />\nhe and Barrett were optimistic<br />\nthat as an annual event, it will<br />\ngrow and will see greater student<br />\ninterest and involvement.<br />\nNelson also hopes to see Faculty Appreciation Week become a<br />\nmore highly publicized campus<br />\nevent next year. He expressed his<br />\ngratitude to all those who helped<br />\nwith the planning of the week and<br />\ncontributed to its success,<br />\nespecially Pratchie Shah, the head<br />\nof the Lyceum, who he said was<br />\nan invaluable contact, and Paul<br />\nRobinson, Interfraternity Council (IFC) President.<br />\n<br />\nStudent Council President Bob Nelson.<br />\n<br />\nDeaver Defends White House Control<br />\nTelevision News Coverage of Reagan Debated<br />\nby Erica Gum<br />\n\"My objective was the survival<br />\nand the success of the Reagan<br />\npresidency. For the media, it was<br />\nbucks,\" said Michael Deaver,<br />\nRonald Reagan's former Deputy<br />\nChief of Staff.<br />\nDeaver spoke before Professor<br />\nRichard Cohen's \"Corporate<br />\nTakeover of Journalism\" class<br />\nand other interested students and<br />\nfaculty on Tuesday, March 26.<br />\nThe good-natured debate that ensued between Deaver, who<br />\ndirected how the White House<br />\npresented the President, and<br />\nCohen, a former producer of the<br />\n\"CBS Evening News,\" focused<br />\non the White House's control of<br />\ntelevision news coverage.<br />\n\"We don't have news on TV,\"<br />\nDeaver said. \"This box is entertainment because that's how the<br />\ncorporations' stockholders are<br />\n<br />\npaid.\"<br />\nDeaver said that while working<br />\nfor Reagan when he was a candidate, and later when he was<br />\nPresident, he thought of himself<br />\nas a producer trying to coordinate<br />\nscenes of Reagan that were so<br />\nentertaining the networks would<br />\nhave to use them.<br />\nFrom his first experiences with<br />\nReagan's 1976 campaign, Deaver<br />\nquickly learned that \"everybody<br />\nfollowed the campaign on the<br />\nevening news.\"<br />\n\"My candidate's ratings stayed<br />\nup because most people didn't<br />\ntake the time to get any of their<br />\ninformation from other news<br />\nsources than this entertainment<br />\nbox. . .80 million people<br />\nwatched 60-second sound bites to<br />\nmake up their minds. I wanted to<br />\nmake that 60 seconds as good as<br />\npossible, so it would make the<br />\nreports of the correspondents<br />\n<br />\ncovering my candidates on the<br />\nevening news,\" he said.<br />\nIt became apparent to Deaver<br />\nthat \"the media needed me more<br />\nthat I needed them.\" Correspondents were grateful when<br />\nhe provide scenes that got them<br />\non the evening news \"because<br />\nthat is how their contracts get<br />\nrenegotiated. This gave me an upper hand.\"<br />\nCohen mentioned a particularly effective scene\u2014one of Ronald<br />\nReagan in a working class Irish<br />\npub in Boston in the midst of the<br />\n1982 recession.<br />\nDeaver described how he had<br />\norchestrated the scene to show<br />\nthat Reagan did care about people, that he was a \"regular guy.\"<br />\nCohen wondered whether this<br />\nscene did not at least shade the<br />\ntruth, if it was not outrightly<br />\ndishonest.<br />\nDeaver replied that is was not<br />\n<br />\nany more dishonest than CBS<br />\nNews trying to show that Reagan<br />\ndid not care about people by going out to West Virginia and<br />\n\"finding a family of 19 in a<br />\nshack, being starved by the cuts<br />\nof Ronald Reagan and his rich<br />\nfriends.\"<br />\nImages like the Irish pub and<br />\nthe family in West Virginia are<br />\nimportant because, according to<br />\nCohen, \"television news is video<br />\ndriven.\"<br />\nDeaver claimed that many in<br />\nthe press resented him because he<br />\nwas better able to provide<br />\nmemorable video than they were.<br />\n\"I was better at my job than they<br />\nwere at theirs,\" he said.<br />\nCorrespondents always had the<br />\noption of not using the video he<br />\nprovided and finding their own,<br />\nDeaver said, but they usually did<br />\nnot because they were lazy.<br />\n<br />\nMergenthaler Hall showing two<br />\nnaked men, one black and one<br />\nwhite, in sexual positions. While<br />\nNewton did not seem to think the<br />\nphoto was offensive, he conceded that it was meant to capture attention and stimulate discussion.<br />\n\"It does have a heavy sexual<br />\ntone, but so does the Ghost movie<br />\nposter and the other ads\u2014people<br />\nneed to see this one from a different perspective.\" Boswell added, \"If people do feel uncomfortable with the ads, it is a sign that<br />\nwe need more education.\"<br />\nOthers found GALA's tactics<br />\nupsetting. \"How would people<br />\nfeel if a group of Hopkins<br />\nstudents decided to go up on a<br />\nplatform and scream, 'I am a<br />\nheterosexual'? The way I see it,<br />\nthey're celebrating their own inability to procreate. I agree that<br />\nthey have rights; nonetheless, this<br />\ndemonstration just shows that<br />\nsome of them still do not have<br />\ntact,\" sophomore A.J. Harper<br />\nsaid.<br />\nHowever, Newton said that<br />\n\"we are not parading our sexuality, and we are not doing what any<br />\nother minority group would not<br />\ndo. This is not a radical<br />\napproach\u2014we want to raise the<br />\nconsciousness at Hopkins and we<br />\nneed acceptance. We're not trying to shove anything down people's throats.\"<br />\nJusick was disappointed by<br />\nwhat he called \"the general<br />\nresistance to the week.\" \"Many<br />\npeople are taking a very insular<br />\nview, saying, 'Oh, it's not for<br />\nme,' when it's simply the opposite.

He didn't have<br />\none. Apparently, Zack had been<br />\ntaking courses based on sleeping<br />\nuntil eleven and not going to class<br />\non Mondays or Fridays.<br />\nOn the plus side, he had at least<br />\nsucceeded in that.<br />\nOn the minus side, it would<br />\ntake him two more years to come<br />\neven close to graduating.<br />\n\"So what do you think I should<br />\ndo here?\"<br />\n\"Throw yourself on the mercy of everyone.\"<br />\n\"Can't I just go back to high<br />\nschool?\"<br />\n\"Zack, with this transcript, I<br />\nthink legally you are still in high<br />\nscbool.\"<br />\nZack started to whimper.<br />\nMiranda's transcript was<br />\nperfect.

Yet despite this harassment,<br />\nperhaps even fueled by it, the members of GALA have coordinated<br />\nand maintained a formidable calendar of events (twenty-one in all)<br />\nthat comprise as wide a range of disciplines as any program<br />\nHomewood has seen this year. These range from films like Tongues<br />\nUntied and Longtime Companion to panel discussions on being gay<br />\nand non-white in America and a coffehouse performance by Christine<br />\nKennedy. This diversity marks LGAW as a uniquely impressive feat<br />\nof campus programming, one of which both GALA and the University can be proud. At the same time, this same protean calendar of<br />\nevents seems to have prevented LGAW from focusing more intensely<br />\non the University climate itself\u2014a climate that is in dire need of<br />\nscrutiny.<br />\nAs with this year's M.S.E. Symposium, which concentrated on<br />\nissues of race relations\u2014particularly between blacks and whites\u2014<br />\nLGAW raises questions about whom it is supposed to serve, educate,<br />\nand entertain. Most of the funding for LGAW came from Johns<br />\nHopkins itself: Student Council, Deans Colombo and Boswell, the<br />\nSAC Board, and the GRO all made substantial contributions to the<br />\nevent. This suggests that it should serve the Hopkins community in<br />\nsome thoroughgoing way. And while any program that addresses<br />\nissues of gay and lesbian awareness arguably serves the community,<br />\nthe News-Letter wonders why GALA did not offer programs with<br />\nbroader appeal\u2014and thus greater possibilities for increasing<br />\nawareness\u2014than a presentation on \"Gay Male Street Culture in 20th<br />\nCentury New York,\" for example.<br />\nMost of the Awareness Week events were not so esoteric.<br />\nNonetheless, GALA seems to have designed LGAW more as a<br />\nspecialized intellectual conference than as a program for community awareness. With a panel addressing \"Building Gay & Lesbian<br />\nCommuinities in Baltimore\" and an examination of \"Gay Life in<br />\nNew York between the Wars\" among the week's events, one wonders<br />\nif GALA really made an effort to reach out to the Hopkins community.<br />\n<br />\nThis Awareness Week seems designed more to promote unity and<br />\nawareness within the Johns Hopkins gay community than within the<br />\ngeneral Hopkins population.<br />\nIndeed, on its schedule of events, GALA identifies Awareness Week<br />\nas something that \"[m]ost importantly. . . encourages the visibility<br />\nand confidence of lesbian and gay people at Johns Hopkins University.\" An important mission indeed. But is it the most important?<br />\nThe News-Letter .thinks that more 'might be gained by modifying<br />\nGALA's insular approach to Awareness Week and designing events<br />\nand publicity materials that would attract people with a wider variety of attitudes about gay and lesbian issues. With that panoply of<br />\nperspectives in hand, GALA could conduct events that might actually<br />\nwork to confront and change people's attitudes about what it means<br />\nto be straight, gay, or bisexual. LGAW should try harder to make<br />\ngays and straights\u2014locked as they seem to be in uneasy opposition\u2014<br />\nmore aware of each other's concerns and priorities.<br />\nWho is it, after all, that defaces posters for events and meetings<br />\nsponsored by GALA and Club W, for example? The News-Letter<br />\nis willing to bet that the culprits aren't members of either group. The<br />\npoint is that tensions run high\u2014not only on campus but throughout<br />\nAmerican society\u2014and that insularity tends to exacerbate those tensions more often than it soothes them. One comment overheard regarding LGAW went as follows: \"Oh,I'm aware of lesbians and gays\u2014I<br />\njust don't want them around.\" As callous and foolish as this may<br />\nsound, GALA's schedule of events for awareness carries a similar,<br />\nthough less pronounced message\u2014something to the effect that \"We're<br />\naware that people don't like or don't understand us, but we don't<br />\nwant to change that.\"<br />\nGALA should extend its efforts at awareness further into the community and especially toward that sector of the community which<br />\nit so quickly labels \"homophobic.\" Clearly, if there is to be<br />\nawareness, it must be taught; by the nature of its role in the community, GALA and other groups like it must bear the burden of<br />\nteaching. When planning its Awareness Week extravaganza for next<br />\nyear, GALA would do well to keep this tutorial role in mind,<br />\nremembering too that teaching means more than merely giving<br />\nlectures.,_<br />\n<br />\nLetters<br />\nIn Defense of Fraternity Party 'Donations'<br />\nTo the Editors:<br />\nwould like to respond to the letter sent in by \"Anonymous\" last<br />\nweek [Letters, March 8]. (By the<br />\nway, what happened to the policy of<br />\nthe letters having to be signed by at<br />\nleast one person?) The author of this<br />\nletter stated, \"Paying money to<br />\nsocialize at Hopkins where there are<br />\nso few orgajobcd social events to<br />\nbegin with is an exclusionary practice. . .\" in reference to being<br />\ncharged for a fraternity party.<br />\nFirst of all, this is not an exclusionary practice. Anyone who pays<br />\nthe $3.00 will be let in. If the author<br />\nwas referring to the fact that fraternity brothers don't have to pay, s/he<br />\nobviously does not understand the<br />\neconomics of the situation. The cost<br />\nof a party to brothers is much greater<br />\nthan $3.00 per brother. The outlay<br />\nfor a party is approximately $500.<br />\nThis does not include the cost of the<br />\ntime the brothers must spend<br />\norganizing, setting up beforehand,<br />\nand cleaning up afterward; nor does<br />\nit include the some $3000 we must<br />\npay for insurance each year, due<br />\nmainly to the risks we assume by<br />\nhaving such parties, nor does it include the price of damage and wear<br />\non the house.<br />\nSecondly, it is not the responsibility of fraternities to provide social<br />\nevents for the campus, although they<br />\ntraditionally have done so at<br />\nHopkins. Brothers do not, and<br />\nshould not, have to spend their time<br />\nand considerable amounts of their<br />\nmoney so you and others may have<br />\nfree beer and a place to party. We<br />\ndo not charge for admission (or beer<br />\nor whatever) for our parties. As a<br />\nresult, we have had to reduce our<br />\nspending in other important areas<br />\nand drastically reduce the number of<br />\nparties we have each semester. The<br />\nIFC and the administration are leaning towards more strongly enforcing<br />\nthis rule, due to the sophomore housing issue among other things. If this<br />\nhappens, \"Anonymous\" and others<br />\n<br />\nwill probably not be able to go to two<br />\nGreek parties in one night; in fact<br />\nthere will be many weekends where<br />\nthere will be no Greek parties at all.<br />\nThomas S. Sornouski<br />\nController, Sigma Phi Epsilon<br />\nTo the Editors;.--Last week a letter was pukiitted<br />\nregarding the \"unfairness Aiwations at fraternity parties [Letters,<br />\nMarch 8]. Unfortunately the<br />\nanonymous person has a seriously<br />\nlimited and incorrect view of the<br />\npolicy of donations.<br />\nUntil last year, the university had<br />\na policy of \"umbrella\" liquor<br />\nlicense, which enabled fraternities to<br />\nhave parties and responsibility for<br />\nthem would be pushed upon the<br />\nshoulders of the university. Unfortunately, the powers that be decided<br />\nnot to risk the university so that<br />\nstudents could have parties off campus. In short, they lost their proverbial balls. Since then, the fraternity<br />\nsystem, fervently wanting to recreate<br />\nthe dying social life at Hopkins, has<br />\ntried several ways to get around the<br />\nlack of liquor license.<br />\nAdditionally, according to the<br />\nmath of the anonymous writer, 350<br />\npeople would be able to generate<br />\n$1000 worth of revenue for the<br />\n<br />\nfraternity. Surprise! Fraternities<br />\nhardly ever break even, let alone<br />\nmake money at their parties. \"How<br />\ndoes this happen?\" asks the lowly<br />\nanonymous writer, who obviously is<br />\nsome sort of economic genius. A<br />\nhalf keg of any cheap beer is fifty<br />\ndollars. Multiply that by seventeen<br />\nto twenty kegs. Add to it the number<br />\nof whiness, suchas that writer, who<br />\nmanage to make themselves such a<br />\npain in the --- to save a couple of<br />\ndollars, that the poor gentlemen<br />\nworking the door are forced to let<br />\nhim/her in in frustration. This adds<br />\nup to no profit, and sometimes even<br />\nloss of money. The fraternity system<br />\nis not University funded. They are<br />\nforced to take the missing balance<br />\nfrom their limited funds.<br />\nSo, for all of the anonymous<br />\nwriters out there, who have no social<br />\nlife without fraternity parties, all of<br />\nus have a message for you. . .1f you<br />\ndon't like it, don't go.

The<br />\nfraternities and sororities at Hopkins<br />\nare responsible for most of the social<br />\nlife at this institution, not only<br />\nthrough the social events offered but<br />\nthe friendship and cameraderie that<br />\nthe Greek system is built upon.<br />\nWithout the fraternity system in<br />\nplace in the universities across the<br />\nnation, college would not be the enjoyable experience that it is now; it<br />\nwould merely seem like four years<br />\nof high school.<br />\nThe concept of the \"mandatory<br />\ndonation\" was born out of necessity of the fraternities and sororities to<br />\ncover the immense cost of operating<br />\nsuch an institution. The cost of having a party is not just the price of<br />\nbeer and personal services contract<br />\nof the D.J., a large portion of the<br />\nresultant \"profits\" as you call them<br />\ngoes to repair the damages incurred<br />\nduring such an event. It is a fact of<br />\nnature that if a large group of people are present in the same place at<br />\nthe same time there exists a great<br />\nchance of damages being done to that<br />\nplace, whether accidental or not. I<br />\nrealize that some people will complain that \"I have never damaged<br />\nanything while at one of these parties!\", but that is simply not true<br />\nbecause of the wear and tear that a<br />\nhouse will undergo when people are<br />\ninvited over by the fraternity or<br />\nsorority to have a good time. In addition, the incidence of theft at parties is high; it seems like everybody<br />\nwants a souvenir. The cost of cleanup is not inconsiderable either, even<br />\nthough the labor is free.

He turned<br />\nout to be invisible, so I decided<br />\nto cut my losses and visit my old<br />\nchum, Dr. F.

Usually, I would have accepted this outburst as a greeting,<br />\nbut I knew that I was dealing with<br />\na member of the psychiatry profession.

Most people will not believe<br />\nthis is true, but all I ask is to check<br />\nthe records of the fraternities. I<br />\nremember my sophomore year when<br />\nthe policy of not being able to charge<br />\nwas instituted (I was at that meeting<br />\nfor the curious). The Alpha Delta<br />\nPhi fraternity had a social event<br />\nwhere it was advertised that the proceeds were to be donated to charity,<br />\nand there was no protest over that,<br />\nunless someone wishes to take donations out of the hands of charity. Indeed, if we were to follow the IFC<br />\nrules to the letter, there would be no<br />\nopen fraternity or sorority parties,<br />\nwhich means that no one would be<br />\nallowed into the party unless a Greek<br />\nmember, specifically invited (with<br />\ninvite present in hand at door), or<br />\npersonally accompanied by a fraternity or sorority that is having the<br />\nsocial event. If this was followed, we<br />\nwould have little protest of our parties because everyone that would be<br />\nthere would understand the operating<br />\ncosts of having such an event.<br />\nIf the University and IFC were so<br />\nconcerned about this \"illegal act\",<br />\nthey could easily stop the practice of<br />\nasking for a \"mandatory donation\"<br />\nthrough their greater resources and<br />\nlegal power. I guess they realize the<br />\nsituation fraternities and sororities<br />\nare in and also the impact of the<br />\nGreek system has on the social life<br />\nat this most prestigious university,<br />\nand they must agree with or at least<br />\ncondone our stan0 on the problem.<br />\nI leave you with a question: why<br />\nshould the fraternities and sororities<br />\nsubsidize another's entertainment?<br />\nSteven M.

With his latest film, Townsend aims to tell a story that is<br />\nmuch more ambitious. The Five<br />\nHeartbeats has its share of comic victories, but they aren't nearly<br />\nenough to save it.<br />\nThe film opens in the<br />\nmid-1960s, as \"The Five Heartbeats\" are on stage performing in<br />\na talent show.

Who doesn't feel the<br />\nslightest twinge of envy at the<br />\nknight martyred in his prime or<br />\nthe cowboy cut down while<br />\ndefending law and order?<br />\nCertainly Herman Roth did.<br />\nThe father of the National Book<br />\nAward-winning author Philip<br />\nRoth recently suffered from a<br />\nbrain tumor which ate away at his<br />\nhealth for years before he finally<br />\nsuccumbed to it in his late<br />\neighties. It began suddenly with<br />\na paralysis of the right half of his<br />\nface, and gradually reduced Herman to a quivering shell of a man,<br />\nno longer able to feed or clean<br />\nhimself properly.<br />\nPhilip Roth's latest book,<br />\nPatrimony (subtitled A True<br />\nStory) chronicles his father's illness from its unexpected beginning to its bitter end. In 238 pages<br />\nof brilliant, no-nonsense prose,<br />\nRoth digs deep into his own soul<br />\nto ask the question: What happens<br />\nwhen you must become a father<br />\nto your father?<br />\nThere are two dangers that<br />\nusually come up in this type of<br />\nopen, confessional writing. The<br />\nfirst is the tendency to write a sort<br />\nof hagiography, to blow up the<br />\nsubject out of proportion (see the<br />\nrecent John Lennon tribute Imagine). The other path, just as<br />\ndangerous, is to trivialize<br />\neverything by emphasizing the<br />\ncaustic and ridiculous.<br />\nRoth avoids both of these shortcomings by not passing any judgment whatsoever on his father's<br />\n<br />\nmiserable death. He tackles<br />\nwrenching moments which could<br />\nhave easily taken a wrong turn into the maudlin by just sticking<br />\nthem doggedly down onto the<br />\npaper; the philosophizing, for the<br />\nmost part, is kept to a minimum.<br />\nAt one point, for example,<br />\nHerman Roth loses control of his<br />\nbowels and soils the entire<br />\nbathroom, leaving his son to deal<br />\nwith the mess. \"You clean up<br />\nyour father's shit because it has<br />\nto be cleaned up,\" the younger<br />\nRoth observes. \". . .once you<br />\nsidestep disgust and ignore<br />\nnausea and plunge past those<br />\nphobias that are fortified like<br />\ntaboos, there's an awful lot of life<br />\nto cherish.\" Similarily, a few<br />\npages later, Roth writes of seeing his father's penis while<br />\nwashing him in the tub: \"I<br />\nlooked at it intently, as though for<br />\nthe very first time, and waited on<br />\nthe thoughts. But there weren't<br />\nany more, except my reminding<br />\nmyself to fix it in my memory for<br />\nwhen he was dead.\"<br />\nAnd this is exactly what Roth<br />\ndoes. We get Herman Roth with<br />\nall his failures and shortcomings<br />\nintact, paradoxically one of the<br />\nmost living and breathing of<br />\nRoth's protagonists. The elder<br />\nRoth was a stubborn, quarrelsome, domineering father who<br />\nrefused to spend thirty-five cents<br />\na day for the New York Times, but<br />\nwaited for friends to pass him a<br />\nused copy. Herman drove his late<br />\nwife close to a breakdown in the<br />\nlast years of their marriage, then<br />\nelevated her to the level of a saint<br />\nposthumously. He may be a difficult man for us to love, but by<br />\nthe book's end we know Herman<br />\nRoth as well as we ever knew<br />\nAlexander Portnoy or Neil<br />\nKlugman.<br />\nThis same kind of brutal hones-<br />\n<br />\nty carries over into the author's<br />\nown personal life. Although he<br />\ndevotes little time to such matters,<br />\nit's not difficult to find a wealth<br />\nof blunt self-appraisal between<br />\nthe lines. The Philip Roth that<br />\ncomes out to us is constantly trying to take the high moral ground,<br />\nespecially when giving away his<br />\ninheritance or lying to his father<br />\nabout his emergency heart<br />\nsurgery.<br />\nOfcourse, not all ofPatrimony<br />\nis such sobering material. A good<br />\ndeal of Roth's audience know him<br />\nfrom the scathing and often<br />\nbawdy sense of humor he's<br />\ndisplayed in novels like Our<br />\nGang and Portnoy's Complaint.<br />\n(\"So you're Philip Roth,\" says<br />\none admiring widow to the author<br />\nin Patrimony. \"Thank you for all<br />\nthe laughs.\") Those who appreciate the slapstick and sarcasm<br />\nwill be pleased to note that Roth<br />\ncan find humor in even the most<br />\nmordant of situations; Patrimony,<br />\nlike a good deal of his work,<br />\nbalances on the line between<br />\ncomedy and tragedy.<br />\nSo, you might be wondering,<br />\nwhat is there to not recommend<br />\nabout Patrimony?<br />\nVery little, actually. Philip<br />\nRoth isn't striving to leap over<br />\nmountains with this book; at<br />\nmost, it's a humble tribute to the<br />\nman who reared him and a personal catharsis for the author.

The<br />\nSyracuse Orangemen are playing<br />\nin their home opener. They are<br />\n61-3 in the Carrier Dome and<br />\nriding a 26 game home winning<br />\nstreak that dates back to 1987.<br />\nBoth teams are 2-1 entering the<br />\ngame and the latest rankings place<br />\nSyracuse at number 6 and<br />\nHopkins number 7. The Blue<br />\nJays' head coach, Tony Seaman,<br />\nis 0-9 against the Orange after<br />\neight seasons at Penn. But<br />\nHopkins is one of only two teams<br />\nto defeat Syracuse in the last four<br />\nyears. But Hopkins never won in<br />\nthe Dome. But the Gaits are gone,<br />\nas are two other first team AllAmericans and nine other<br />\nOrangemen. But Syracuse is the<br />\nthree-time defending National<br />\nChampions and they've beaten<br />\nHopkins in five of their last six<br />\nmeetings. But Hopkins is the only<br />\nteam on the Syracuse schedule<br />\nwith a winning record against the<br />\nOrange (13-7-1).<br />\nMake that 14-7-1 now. In their<br />\nbiggest victory of the young<br />\nseason, Hopkins handily defeated<br />\nthe Orange 18-12 before a<br />\nstunned 'crowd of 10,936.<br />\nHopkins joined Cornell and Cortland (Seaman's Alma Mater) as<br />\nthe only teams to defeat Syracuse<br />\nin the Carrier Dome. At 3-1,<br />\nHopkins moved up to the fifth<br />\nspot in this week's Coaches Poll<br />\nwhile Syracuse fell to ninth.<br />\nHopkins had two players with<br />\nthree goals each and four more<br />\nwith two apiece as ten different<br />\nplayers figured in the scoring for<br />\nHopkins. For the Orangemen,<br />\nTom Marechek scored five times<br />\n<br />\nto lift his team leading total to Panetta found a cutting Charlie<br />\ntwelve goals. However, without Speno who launched a shot past<br />\nthe Gaits, the lone hold over the the shaky Syracuse goalie. The<br />\n\"Canadian Connection\" did not half ended 9-8 and the Jays were<br />\nhave enough support around him in the game largely due to Panetto lift Syracuse to victory.<br />\nta, who registered three goals and<br />\nSyracuse began where they left three assists in the first half, and<br />\noff last season. 1:20 into the junior goalie Scott Giardina, who<br />\ngame, number 22 wound up and played the best game of his career<br />\ncranked a shot. No it wasn't Gary despite a lackluster performance<br />\nGait, but the result of the by the close defense.<br />\nfreshman sensation Charlie<br />\nWith things looking a bit like<br />\nLockwood's shot was the same last year's 10-8 halftime score,<br />\nand the crowd erupted after the the Jays were in no position to exSyracuse goal.

Hopkins clinched the win<br />\nwhen Mike Kim won his match<br />\nat second singles, giving the Jays<br />\nfive wins in six singles matches.<br />\nHopkins had lost to Catholic each<br />\nof the past two seasons, in part<br />\ndue to injuries and absences on<br />\nthe day of the match. In Tuesday's match, in fact, the Jays<br />\nwere without Ted Roth, last<br />\n<br />\nyear's number three player, who<br />\nis injured. This year's team,<br />\nhowever, is so deep that it can<br />\nsurvive one or two missing<br />\nplayers.<br />\nAgainst Catholic, Lorin Engquist scored a quick 6-1, 6-3 win<br />\nat number one singles against an<br />\nopponent that he had beaten on<br />\ntwo previous occasions. The<br />\ndeliberate baseliner did attack on<br />\noccasion, almost exclusively to<br />\nhis opponent's weak backhand.<br />\nFor the most part, however, Engquist employed his usual strategy:<br />\nimitate a backboard.

At number<br />\nfour singles, Bill Braude was<br />\nunable to win his match, which<br />\nwent three sets to the surprise of<br />\nno one. Braude has gone three<br />\nsets in nine consecutive matches<br />\n(he's won six). Kanu Jerath, a<br />\nsophomore transfer student from<br />\nWilliams College, won in a<br />\nstrange match at fifth singles.

This feat is all the more<br />\nimpressive since two of the Lady<br />\nJays' first three games have been<br />\nagainst nationally ranked opponents (Ursinus 3rd, Roanoke<br />\n16th).<br />\n\"Dawn and Jen are two of our<br />\nmost consistent players,.\" said<br />\ncoach Sally Beth Anderson.<br />\n\"They are good in man-to-man<br />\nsituations as well as smart team<br />\ndefenders.\"<br />\nAnother key to the Lady Jays'<br />\ndefensive success has been<br />\ngoalkeeper Kristin Cole.

After performing sluggishly during a 4-5-1<br />\nFlorida road trip, the Jays returned in style, banging out eight<br />\nsingles and a pair of doubles in<br />\nan 8-3 win over St. John Fisher.<br />\nFreshman infielder Scott Cade<br />\nscored four times, and a pair of<br />\nsophomores, third baseman Sean<br />\nHolub and first baseman Matt<br />\nMertz, drove in two apiece to help<br />\nthe Jays break out of their offensive drought. Junior Digger<br />\nWalter(2-1) went the distance for<br />\nHopkins, yielding only six hits<br />\nand a walk while striking out five.<br />\nThe victory raised the team's<br />\noverall record to 7-8-1.<br />\nThe win over St. John Fisher<br />\nwas extremely satisfying,<br />\nespecially considering the general<br />\ndisappointment over the team's<br />\nplay in Florida. \"There were just<br />\nso many games in Florida in such<br />\na short period,\" said senior Brad<br />\nHerman. \"It was hard to keep our<br />\nconcentration from one game to<br />\n<br />\nthe next, and I think that's why<br />\nwe struggled.\"<br />\nA more tangible reason for the<br />\nJays' problems might have been<br />\nthe offense's collective slump,<br />\nand its inability to perform in the<br />\nclutch. As senior pitcher David<br />\nKiskis stated, \"We hit the ball<br />\npretty well as a whole, but just<br />\nnot when we needed to.\" In a 4-0<br />\nloss to Hobart, for example, the<br />\nJays scorched several balls, and<br />\nwere left with only two hits to<br />\nshow for their efforts.<br />\nOverall, despite the losing<br />\nrecord, the Florida trip was not<br />\na completely wasted experience.<br />\nThe pitching staff made tangible<br />\nprogress, as did many of the<br />\nyoung players. This was especially true in the infield, which<br />\nregularly starts two freshmen and<br />\ntwo sophomores. \"The key thing<br />\nis that our young players gained<br />\nexperience, and we can look forward to a strong second half,\"<br />\nWalter said.<br />\nTwo of the young infielders,<br />\nfreshmen Cade and Joe Kail,<br />\ncombined for eleven of the club's<br />\ntwenty-two stolen bases, pro-<br />\n<br />\nviding a much-needed infusion of<br />\nspeed. Menz (.310) and senior<br />\noutfielder Ken Brodkowski(.397)<br />\nhave supplied the power, with six<br />\nhomeruns and twenty-eight RBI<br />\nbetween them. Junior outfielder<br />\nMarzio Trotta (.386), senior outfielder Ken Krocenski (.372, 11<br />\nRBI), and senior catcher Pete<br />\nKwiterovich (.282) have been<br />\nsteady contributors.

Junior Jeff Fang is<br />\nonly 1-2 this season, but he sports<br />\na sparkling 2.25 earned run<br />\naverage.

His nine goals<br />\nand fourteen assists give him a<br />\nteam leading 23 points. Senior tricaptain Seth Tierney is second<br />\nwith six goals and five assists for<br />\neleven points.

During the first<br />\nroad game of the season, Matt<br />\n<br />\nPanetta broke out of his early<br />\nseason goal scoring slump. After<br />\ngiving a separated shoulder the<br />\nopportunity to heal, the AllAmerican senior attackman<br />\nstepped forward with four goals<br />\nand two assists to continue<br />\nleading the Jays in scoring. Brendan Cody, also healing a sore arm<br />\nshowed why Seaman was so excited about bringing the Nassau<br />\nAll-American to Hopkins this<br />\nwinter. Two minutes into the<br />\nthird quarter, Cody put the Jays<br />\nahead with his first goal of the<br />\nseason. He added two more in the<br />\nfourth quarter as Hopkins put the<br />\ngame away with eight straight<br />\ngoals.<br />\nAsked about the slow start,<br />\nSeaman pointed to the quality of<br />\nshots taken in each half. \"We<br />\ndidn't change anything at<br />\nhalftime. In the first half, we had<br />\nsixteen shots but only six on<br />\ngoal,\" noted Seaman. The Jays<br />\ntook only seventeen shots in the<br />\nsecond half but this time thirteen<br />\nhit the six-by-six.<br />\nJeff Wills added two goals and<br />\none assist on the day. Rounding<br />\nout the scoring were Tierney<br />\n(1,2), Speno (1,1), Lukacz(1,0),<br />\nMike Morrissey (1,0) and Dave<br />\nBurns (0,1). Giardina played the<br />\nentire game in goal and recorded ten saves.<br />\n<br />\nWomen's Fencers 7th<br />\nat NIWFA Tourney<br />\nby Jessica Rosenbaum<br />\nOn Saturday, March 9th, the<br />\nwomen's fencing team placed<br />\nseventh (of thirteen) at Hunter<br />\nCollege in New York City in the<br />\nNational Intercollegiate Women's<br />\nFencing Association Championships (NIWFA).<br />\nCoach Gary Green was very<br />\npleased with the team's performance. He commented, \"The<br />\nNIWFA championship was a<br />\nvery positive way to end the<br />\nseason. We faced the same teams<br />\nthat we had competed against<br />\nearlier in the season and it was<br />\nevident that our team, as a whole,<br />\nhad improved.\"<br />\nThe NIWFA competition is set<br />\nup differently from most of the<br />\nother ,meets in the team's<br />\nschedule. Each member of the<br />\nteam is assigned a different<br />\n\"strip\" (A,B,C or D). The individual team members then cornpete against their counterparts on<br />\nthe other teams.<br />\nGreen commented, \"Most of<br />\nour top women are very similar<br />\nin ability, so it was difficult to<br />\nrank them for this competition.<br />\nSenior co-captain Erica Roulier<br />\nwas selected to compete in the<br />\ndifficult A strip because she has<br />\na very adaptable fencing style.\"<br />\nGreen praised Roulier's perfor-<br />\n<br />\nmance in the A strip. \"She didn't<br />\nbeat many of her competitors, but<br />\nshe did a very decentjob in a very<br />\ntough position.\"<br />\nThe other senior co-captain,<br />\nKeiko Akasofu, also performed<br />\nextremely well. She won seven<br />\nmatches out of the ten or eleven<br />\nthat she played in the D strip,<br />\nAnne Korin also substituted in the<br />\nD strip,<br />\nIn the C strip competition,<br />\nLaura Greenwald did the bulk of<br />\nthe work, with some substitutions<br />\nfrom Allene Salcedo.

Swimming<br />\nagainst a field of more than 80<br />\nteams, the Hopkins' men finished in the top ten for the twentyfirst consecutive year with their<br />\nseventh place finish and the<br />\nfinished<br />\nwomen's<br />\nteam<br />\nthirteenth.<br />\nAlthough the men improved a<br />\nnotch from last year's eighth<br />\nplace finish, they did not have the<br />\nkind of meet they had hoped for<br />\nbecause of injuries and illnesses.<br />\nSophomore Eric Steidinger, a<br />\nconsistent performer for the team<br />\nall year, was sidelined with disc<br />\nproblems, and sophomore Jim<br />\nQuinn caught the flu at the meet,<br />\nbut competed in a reduced<br />\ncapacity,<br />\nDespite being hampered by<br />\nSteidinger's injury and Quinn's<br />\nillness, the men managed to<br />\nmaintain their competitive edge<br />\nby getting a number of outstanding individual performances.<br />\nSpearheading the effort for the<br />\nmen was junior Jay Smith who<br />\ntook fourth in the 100 yard<br />\nbackstroke, sixth in the 100 yard<br />\nfreestyle, and eight in the 50 yard<br />\nfreestyle.<br />\nSenior Steve Giangrandi<br />\nclosed out his successful diving<br />\ncareer at Hopkins by turning in<br />\nyet another outstanding performance. Giangrandi took fifth on<br />\nthe one meter diving board, and<br />\nseventh on the three meter board.<br />\n<br />\nIn addition to Giangrandi's effort,<br />\nthe men were also bolstered by<br />\nthe performances of freshman<br />\nJim Stefansic and Quinn. Stefansic finished sixth in the 400 yard<br />\nindividual medley and Quinn,<br />\nbattling the flu as well as the cornpetition, managed to finish fifteenth in the 200 yard<br />\nbreaststroke.<br />\nThe Hopkins women's team<br />\nfinished thirteenth this year,<br />\nwhich was down from their<br />\neleventh place finish of last year,<br />\nbut it is an ironic reversal of fortune which reflects how cornpetitive the field was this year at<br />\nNationals. The irony stems from<br />\nthe fact that although the women<br />\nimproved on their times from last<br />\nyear's finish, they actually finished lower this year because a<br />\nparticularly strong field led to a<br />\nfaster meet.<br />\n- The junior combination of Betsy Batchelor and Stephanie<br />\nDengler anchored the women's<br />\nteam at Nationals, as they had all<br />\nyear long. Dengler took sixth in<br />\nthe 1650 yard freestyle, tenth in<br />\nthe 400 yard individual medley,<br />\nand twelfth in the 500 yard<br />\nfreestyle, while Batchelor finished sixth in the 200 yard<br />\nbreaststroke and eighth in the 100<br />\nyard breaststroke.

The week marks the<br />\nevolution from \"a group that<br />\npractically did not exist when I<br /><br />\ncame\u2014 to Hopkins in 1987,\"<br />\norganizer Stephen Kent Jusick<br />\nsaid. \"Since then, we have increased our membership and<br />\nvisibility, and after having a certain amount of success last year,<br />\nwe felt that we finally had the<br />\nleadership and support to have a<br />\nweek full of programs.\"<br />\nOrganizer Erik Newton also<br />\nsaid that because it was the first<br />\nAwareness Week at Hopkins,<br />\ngood planning was critical. -That<br />\nis the reason why we have 21<br />\nevents prepared, and we hope to<br />\nget additional funding and support from the University,\" he<br />\nsaid.

Some people urged the student community to accept their<br />\ndifferences, while others spoke of<br />\ntheir family and friends' reactions<br />\nwhen they revealed their sexual<br />\npreferences.

In the relatively short<br />\nperiod of two years, the program<br />\nhas achieved phenomenal success, according to the program's<br />\ndirector, Professor of History<br />\nJudith Walkowitz.<br />\nThe Women's Studies minor<br />\nwas formed as a result of increasing demand from students for formal recognition for their<br />\ncoursework, Walkowitz said.<br />\nWalkowitz, who was a founder<br />\nof the Women's Studies Program<br />\nat Rutgers University, assumed<br />\nher role as director only last fall.<br />\nShe said that it is easier to make<br />\na difference at Hopkins because<br />\nit is such a small place compared<br />\nto Rutgers, which has a student<br />\nbody of more than three thou-<br /><br />\nsand. However, Hopkins has<br />\nbeen \"tardy and very cautious\"<br />\nabout implementing the Women's<br />\nStudies Program, she said.<br />\nThe current program is the<br />\nculmination of ten years of persistence and work by Hopkins<br />\nfaculty members like Mary<br />\nPoovy, Professor of English.<br />\nPoovy, as acting director of the<br />\nprogram, set things in motion in<br />\nthe fall of 1989, with the introduction of four courses that<br />\nwere cross-listed in the Women's<br />\nStudies department.<br />\nThe number of courses offered<br />\nhas grown to fifty in two years,<br />\nwith twenty-one courses being<br />\ntaught this semester.

She said that the<br />\nprogram is sustained mainly by<br />\ninterest since it is primarily funded by other departments, including History, English,<br />\nSociology, and Anthropology<br />\nwhich are willing to cross-list<br />\nsome courses in the Department<br />\nof Women's Studies.<br />\nThe program's only other<br />\nsource of funds is a $150,000<br />\ngrant from the Ford Foundation.<br />\nThe grant allows the department<br />\nto sponsor five $2000 fellowships<br />\nfor travel or research related to<br />\nWomen's Studies.<br />\nCourses in Women's Studies<br />\nconcentrate on the \"activities,<br />\npractices, and experiences of<br />\nwomen in history and contemporary society,\" according to<br />\nWalkowitz. Courses also explore<br />\n\"the dynamics of gender relation,<br />\nthe construction of masculinity<br />\nand femininity ideals by society,\"<br />\nshe said.<br />\nOne-third of courses focus on<br />\nwomen's studies specifically,<br />\nwhile the remainder incorporate<br />\nit as a principal component.<br />\nWalkowitz says that the program<br />\nprovides \"a meeting place\" for<br />\na variety of disciplines and points<br />\nof views.<br />\nRequirements for the minor are<br />\nsix one-semester courses, including at least four upper-level<br />\ncourses. Students must also<br />\nchoose these courses from the<br />\nSocial Sciences as well as the<br />\nHumanities area.<br />\nAccording to Walkowitz, the<br />\nmain objective of the program is<br />\nan \"attempt to restore visibility<br />\nto Women's Studies.\" She hopes<br />\nthat the program will change the<br />\natmosphere of the University to<br />\na certain extent, offering students<br />\nan alternative intellectual and<br />\ncultural community.<br /><br />\nTuition Keeps Climbing<br />\n$1 6,000<br /><br />\n$1 4,000<br /><br />\nday's tearing down of a GALA<br />\nbanner, specifically created for<br />\n$1 2,000<br />\nAwareness Week, as an example.<br />\n\"It was a premeditated act by<br />\n$1 0,000<br />\nsome Hopkins students, and it's<br />\na petty way of trying to<br />\ndiscourage us.

He told<br />\nthe officers in his letter that this<br />\nis the first time students have<br />\nmade a move to show their appreciation for faculty in the thirty years that he has been teaching<br />\nat Hopkins.<br />\nNelson's goal in planning the<br />\nFaculty Appreciation Week was<br />\nto help boost faculty-student interaction and to give outstanding<br />\nprofessors a chance to receive<br />\nfeedback from their students.<br />\nComputer Science Professor<br />\nBarrett, one of those recognized<br />\nat the dinner, called the event a<br />\n\"great idea,\" saying that<br />\nHopkins \"has a reputation for<br />\nrewarding professors only for<br />\nresearch.\" He was very happy to<br />\nsee professors recognized for<br />\ntheir direct work with the<br />\nstudents. Barrett believes that this<br />\ndemonstrates to professors the<br />\nimpact they can have upon their<br />\nstudents and sees it as a positive<br />\nincentive for faculty members to<br />\nwork harder.<br />\nWilliam Busa of the Department of Biology, also nominated,<br />\nto be recognized, stated that<br />\n\"most universities have few<br />\nmechanisms for professors to<br />\nassess the effects of their<br />\nteaching,\" and that it can often<br />\nbe \"unrewarding\" when they<br />\nwork hard at teaching well. Often<br />\ntimes, students do not realize that<br />\ntheir professors are accessible, or<br />\nthe students are too timid to approach them directly. Busa expressed his hope that having a<br />\nFaculty Appreciation Week will<br />\nhelp make professors more open-<br /><br />\nContinued from page 1<br />\nseems that the administration is<br />\nsincere in its efforts and is beginning to loosen up.\"<br />\nAlthough he has not had any<br />\nformal protests yet, Newton<br />\nspeculated that more controversial events later in the week might<br />\nprovoke some strong responses.<br />\n\"I expect there will be a lot of<br />\nreaction at the discussion about<br />\nhomophobia and the American<br />\nmilitary,\" he said.<br />\nThere were some who found<br />\nthe posters for Awareness Week<br />\nunnerving, especially one in<br />\nAMR II and the entrance of<br /><br />\nly accessible to students, and both<br />\nhe and Barrett were optimistic<br />\nthat as an annual event, it will<br />\ngrow and will see greater student<br />\ninterest and involvement.<br />\nNelson also hopes to see Faculty Appreciation Week become a<br />\nmore highly publicized campus<br />\nevent next year. He expressed his<br />\ngratitude to all those who helped<br />\nwith the planning of the week and<br />\ncontributed to its success,<br />\nespecially Pratchie Shah, the head<br />\nof the Lyceum, who he said was<br />\nan invaluable contact, and Paul<br />\nRobinson, Interfraternity Council (IFC) President.<br /><br />\nStudent Council President Bob Nelson.<br /><br />\nDeaver Defends White House Control<br />\nTelevision News Coverage of Reagan Debated<br />\nby Erica Gum<br />\n\"My objective was the survival<br />\nand the success of the Reagan<br />\npresidency.

I wanted to<br />\nmake that 60 seconds as good as<br />\npossible, so it would make the<br />\nreports of the correspondents<br /><br />\ncovering my candidates on the<br />\nevening news,\" he said.<br />\nIt became apparent to Deaver<br />\nthat \"the media needed me more<br />\nthat I needed them.\" Correspondents were grateful when<br />\nhe provide scenes that got them<br />\non the evening news \"because<br />\nthat is how their contracts get<br />\nrenegotiated. This gave me an upper hand.\"<br />\nCohen mentioned a particularly effective scene\u2014one of Ronald<br />\nReagan in a working class Irish<br />\npub in Boston in the midst of the<br />\n1982 recession.<br />\nDeaver described how he had<br />\norchestrated the scene to show<br />\nthat Reagan did care about people, that he was a \"regular guy.\"<br />\nCohen wondered whether this<br />\nscene did not at least shade the<br />\ntruth, if it was not outrightly<br />\ndishonest.<br />\nDeaver replied that is was not<br /><br />\nany more dishonest than CBS<br />\nNews trying to show that Reagan<br />\ndid not care about people by going out to West Virginia and<br />\n\"finding a family of 19 in a<br />\nshack, being starved by the cuts<br />\nof Ronald Reagan and his rich<br />\nfriends.\"<br />\nImages like the Irish pub and<br />\nthe family in West Virginia are<br />\nimportant because, according to<br />\nCohen, \"television news is video<br />\ndriven.\"<br />\nDeaver claimed that many in<br />\nthe press resented him because he<br />\nwas better able to provide<br />\nmemorable video than they were.<br />\n\"I was better at my job than they<br />\nwere at theirs,\" he said.<br />\nCorrespondents always had the<br />\noption of not using the video he<br />\nprovided and finding their own,<br />\nDeaver said, but they usually did<br />\nnot because they were lazy.<br /><br />\nMergenthaler Hall showing two<br />\nnaked men, one black and one<br />\nwhite, in sexual positions.

Yet despite this harassment,<br />\nperhaps even fueled by it, the members of GALA have coordinated<br />\nand maintained a formidable calendar of events (twenty-one in all)<br />\nthat comprise as wide a range of disciplines as any program<br />\nHomewood has seen this year. These range from films like Tongues<br />\nUntied and Longtime Companion to panel discussions on being gay<br />\nand non-white in America and a coffehouse performance by Christine<br />\nKennedy. This diversity marks LGAW as a uniquely impressive feat<br />\nof campus programming, one of which both GALA and the University can be proud. At the same time, this same protean calendar of<br />\nevents seems to have prevented LGAW from focusing more intensely<br />\non the University climate itself\u2014a climate that is in dire need of<br />\nscrutiny.<br />\nAs with this year's M.S.E. Symposium, which concentrated on<br />\nissues of race relations\u2014particularly between blacks and whites\u2014<br />\nLGAW raises questions about whom it is supposed to serve, educate,<br />\nand entertain. Most of the funding for LGAW came from Johns<br />\nHopkins itself: Student Council, Deans Colombo and Boswell, the<br />\nSAC Board, and the GRO all made substantial contributions to the<br />\nevent. This suggests that it should serve the Hopkins community in<br />\nsome thoroughgoing way. And while any program that addresses<br />\nissues of gay and lesbian awareness arguably serves the community,<br />\nthe News-Letter wonders why GALA did not offer programs with<br />\nbroader appeal\u2014and thus greater possibilities for increasing<br />\nawareness\u2014than a presentation on \"Gay Male Street Culture in 20th<br />\nCentury New York,\" for example.<br />\nMost of the Awareness Week events were not so esoteric.<br />\nNonetheless, GALA seems to have designed LGAW more as a<br />\nspecialized intellectual conference than as a program for community awareness. With a panel addressing \"Building Gay &amp; Lesbian<br />\nCommuinities in Baltimore\" and an examination of \"Gay Life in<br />\nNew York between the Wars\" among the week's events, one wonders<br />\nif GALA really made an effort to reach out to the Hopkins community.<br /><br />\nThis Awareness Week seems designed more to promote unity and<br />\nawareness within the Johns Hopkins gay community than within the<br />\ngeneral Hopkins population.<br />\nIndeed, on its schedule of events, GALA identifies Awareness Week<br />\nas something that \"[m]ost importantly. . . encourages the visibility<br />\nand confidence of lesbian and gay people at Johns Hopkins University.\" An important mission indeed. But is it the most important?<br />\nThe News-Letter .thinks that more 'might be gained by modifying<br />\nGALA's insular approach to Awareness Week and designing events<br />\nand publicity materials that would attract people with a wider variety of attitudes about gay and lesbian issues. With that panoply of<br />\nperspectives in hand, GALA could conduct events that might actually<br />\nwork to confront and change people's attitudes about what it means<br />\nto be straight, gay, or bisexual. LGAW should try harder to make<br />\ngays and straights\u2014locked as they seem to be in uneasy opposition\u2014<br />\nmore aware of each other's concerns and priorities.<br />\nWho is it, after all, that defaces posters for events and meetings<br />\nsponsored by GALA and Club W, for example? The News-Letter<br />\nis willing to bet that the culprits aren't members of either group. The<br />\npoint is that tensions run high\u2014not only on campus but throughout<br />\nAmerican society\u2014and that insularity tends to exacerbate those tensions more often than it soothes them. One comment overheard regarding LGAW went as follows: \"Oh,I'm aware of lesbians and gays\u2014I<br />\njust don't want them around.\" As callous and foolish as this may<br />\nsound, GALA's schedule of events for awareness carries a similar,<br />\nthough less pronounced message\u2014something to the effect that \"We're<br />\naware that people don't like or don't understand us, but we don't<br />\nwant to change that.\"<br />\nGALA should extend its efforts at awareness further into the community and especially toward that sector of the community which<br />\nit so quickly labels \"homophobic.\" Clearly, if there is to be<br />\nawareness, it must be taught; by the nature of its role in the community, GALA and other groups like it must bear the burden of<br />\nteaching. When planning its Awareness Week extravaganza for next<br />\nyear, GALA would do well to keep this tutorial role in mind,<br />\nremembering too that teaching means more than merely giving<br />\nlectures.,_<br /><br />\nLetters<br />\nIn Defense of Fraternity Party 'Donations'<br />\nTo the Editors:<br />\nwould like to respond to the letter sent in by \"Anonymous\" last<br />\nweek [Letters, March 8]. (By the<br />\nway, what happened to the policy of<br />\nthe letters having to be signed by at<br />\nleast one person?) The author of this<br />\nletter stated, \"Paying money to<br />\nsocialize at Hopkins where there are<br />\nso few orgajobcd social events to<br />\nbegin with is an exclusionary practice. . .\" in reference to being<br />\ncharged for a fraternity party.<br />\nFirst of all, this is not an exclusionary practice. Anyone who pays<br />\nthe $3.00 will be let in. If the author<br />\nwas referring to the fact that fraternity brothers don't have to pay, s/he<br />\nobviously does not understand the<br />\neconomics of the situation. The cost<br />\nof a party to brothers is much greater<br />\nthan $3.00 per brother. The outlay<br />\nfor a party is approximately $500.<br />\nThis does not include the cost of the<br />\ntime the brothers must spend<br />\norganizing, setting up beforehand,<br />\nand cleaning up afterward; nor does<br />\nit include the some $3000 we must<br />\npay for insurance each year, due<br />\nmainly to the risks we assume by<br />\nhaving such parties, nor does it include the price of damage and wear<br />\non the house.<br />\nSecondly, it is not the responsibility of fraternities to provide social<br />\nevents for the campus, although they<br />\ntraditionally have done so at<br />\nHopkins. Brothers do not, and<br />\nshould not, have to spend their time<br />\nand considerable amounts of their<br />\nmoney so you and others may have<br />\nfree beer and a place to party. We<br />\ndo not charge for admission (or beer<br />\nor whatever) for our parties. As a<br />\nresult, we have had to reduce our<br />\nspending in other important areas<br />\nand drastically reduce the number of<br />\nparties we have each semester. The<br />\nIFC and the administration are leaning towards more strongly enforcing<br />\nthis rule, due to the sophomore housing issue among other things. If this<br />\nhappens, \"Anonymous\" and others<br /><br />\nwill probably not be able to go to two<br />\nGreek parties in one night; in fact<br />\nthere will be many weekends where<br />\nthere will be no Greek parties at all.<br />\nThomas S. Sornouski<br />\nController, Sigma Phi Epsilon<br />\nTo the Editors;.--Last week a letter was pukiitted<br />\nregarding the \"unfairness Aiwations at fraternity parties [Letters,<br />\nMarch 8]. Unfortunately the<br />\nanonymous person has a seriously<br />\nlimited and incorrect view of the<br />\npolicy of donations.<br />\nUntil last year, the university had<br />\na policy of \"umbrella\" liquor<br />\nlicense, which enabled fraternities to<br />\nhave parties and responsibility for<br />\nthem would be pushed upon the<br />\nshoulders of the university. Unfortunately, the powers that be decided<br />\nnot to risk the university so that<br />\nstudents could have parties off campus. In short, they lost their proverbial balls. Since then, the fraternity<br />\nsystem, fervently wanting to recreate<br />\nthe dying social life at Hopkins, has<br />\ntried several ways to get around the<br />\nlack of liquor license.<br />\nAdditionally, according to the<br />\nmath of the anonymous writer, 350<br />\npeople would be able to generate<br />\n$1000 worth of revenue for the<br /><br />\nfraternity. Surprise! Fraternities<br />\nhardly ever break even, let alone<br />\nmake money at their parties. \"How<br />\ndoes this happen?\" asks the lowly<br />\nanonymous writer, who obviously is<br />\nsome sort of economic genius. A<br />\nhalf keg of any cheap beer is fifty<br />\ndollars. Multiply that by seventeen<br />\nto twenty kegs. Add to it the number<br />\nof whiness, suchas that writer, who<br />\nmanage to make themselves such a<br />\npain in the --- to save a couple of<br />\ndollars, that the poor gentlemen<br />\nworking the door are forced to let<br />\nhim/her in in frustration. This adds<br />\nup to no profit, and sometimes even<br />\nloss of money. The fraternity system<br />\nis not University funded. They are<br />\nforced to take the missing balance<br />\nfrom their limited funds.<br />\nSo, for all of the anonymous<br />\nwriters out there, who have no social<br />\nlife without fraternity parties, all of<br />\nus have a message for you. . .1f you<br />\ndon't like it, don't go.

The<br />\nfraternities and sororities at Hopkins<br />\nare responsible for most of the social<br />\nlife at this institution, not only<br />\nthrough the social events offered but<br />\nthe friendship and cameraderie that<br />\nthe Greek system is built upon.<br />\nWithout the fraternity system in<br />\nplace in the universities across the<br />\nnation, college would not be the enjoyable experience that it is now; it<br />\nwould merely seem like four years<br />\nof high school.<br />\nThe concept of the \"mandatory<br />\ndonation\" was born out of necessity of the fraternities and sororities to<br />\ncover the immense cost of operating<br />\nsuch an institution. The cost of having a party is not just the price of<br />\nbeer and personal services contract<br />\nof the D.J., a large portion of the<br />\nresultant \"profits\" as you call them<br />\ngoes to repair the damages incurred<br />\nduring such an event. It is a fact of<br />\nnature that if a large group of people are present in the same place at<br />\nthe same time there exists a great<br />\nchance of damages being done to that<br />\nplace, whether accidental or not. I<br />\nrealize that some people will complain that \"I have never damaged<br />\nanything while at one of these parties!\", but that is simply not true<br />\nbecause of the wear and tear that a<br />\nhouse will undergo when people are<br />\ninvited over by the fraternity or<br />\nsorority to have a good time. In addition, the incidence of theft at parties is high; it seems like everybody<br />\nwants a souvenir. The cost of cleanup is not inconsiderable either, even<br />\nthough the labor is free.

Most people will not believe<br />\nthis is true, but all I ask is to check<br />\nthe records of the fraternities. I<br />\nremember my sophomore year when<br />\nthe policy of not being able to charge<br />\nwas instituted (I was at that meeting<br />\nfor the curious). The Alpha Delta<br />\nPhi fraternity had a social event<br />\nwhere it was advertised that the proceeds were to be donated to charity,<br />\nand there was no protest over that,<br />\nunless someone wishes to take donations out of the hands of charity. Indeed, if we were to follow the IFC<br />\nrules to the letter, there would be no<br />\nopen fraternity or sorority parties,<br />\nwhich means that no one would be<br />\nallowed into the party unless a Greek<br />\nmember, specifically invited (with<br />\ninvite present in hand at door), or<br />\npersonally accompanied by a fraternity or sorority that is having the<br />\nsocial event. If this was followed, we<br />\nwould have little protest of our parties because everyone that would be<br />\nthere would understand the operating<br />\ncosts of having such an event.<br />\nIf the University and IFC were so<br />\nconcerned about this \"illegal act\",<br />\nthey could easily stop the practice of<br />\nasking for a \"mandatory donation\"<br />\nthrough their greater resources and<br />\nlegal power. I guess they realize the<br />\nsituation fraternities and sororities<br />\nare in and also the impact of the<br />\nGreek system has on the social life<br />\nat this most prestigious university,<br />\nand they must agree with or at least<br />\ncondone our stan0 on the problem.<br />\nI leave you with a question: why<br />\nshould the fraternities and sororities<br />\nsubsidize another's entertainment?<br />\nSteven M.

It began suddenly with<br />\na paralysis of the right half of his<br />\nface, and gradually reduced Herman to a quivering shell of a man,<br />\nno longer able to feed or clean<br />\nhimself properly.<br />\nPhilip Roth's latest book,<br />\nPatrimony (subtitled A True<br />\nStory) chronicles his father's illness from its unexpected beginning to its bitter end. In 238 pages<br />\nof brilliant, no-nonsense prose,<br />\nRoth digs deep into his own soul<br />\nto ask the question: What happens<br />\nwhen you must become a father<br />\nto your father?<br />\nThere are two dangers that<br />\nusually come up in this type of<br />\nopen, confessional writing. The<br />\nfirst is the tendency to write a sort<br />\nof hagiography, to blow up the<br />\nsubject out of proportion (see the<br />\nrecent John Lennon tribute Imagine). The other path, just as<br />\ndangerous, is to trivialize<br />\neverything by emphasizing the<br />\ncaustic and ridiculous.<br />\nRoth avoids both of these shortcomings by not passing any judgment whatsoever on his father's<br /><br />\nmiserable death. He tackles<br />\nwrenching moments which could<br />\nhave easily taken a wrong turn into the maudlin by just sticking<br />\nthem doggedly down onto the<br />\npaper; the philosophizing, for the<br />\nmost part, is kept to a minimum.<br />\nAt one point, for example,<br />\nHerman Roth loses control of his<br />\nbowels and soils the entire<br />\nbathroom, leaving his son to deal<br />\nwith the mess. \"You clean up<br />\nyour father's shit because it has<br />\nto be cleaned up,\" the younger<br />\nRoth observes. \". . .once you<br />\nsidestep disgust and ignore<br />\nnausea and plunge past those<br />\nphobias that are fortified like<br />\ntaboos, there's an awful lot of life<br />\nto cherish.\" Similarily, a few<br />\npages later, Roth writes of seeing his father's penis while<br />\nwashing him in the tub: \"I<br />\nlooked at it intently, as though for<br />\nthe very first time, and waited on<br />\nthe thoughts. But there weren't<br />\nany more, except my reminding<br />\nmyself to fix it in my memory for<br />\nwhen he was dead.\"<br />\nAnd this is exactly what Roth<br />\ndoes. We get Herman Roth with<br />\nall his failures and shortcomings<br />\nintact, paradoxically one of the<br />\nmost living and breathing of<br />\nRoth's protagonists. The elder<br />\nRoth was a stubborn, quarrelsome, domineering father who<br />\nrefused to spend thirty-five cents<br />\na day for the New York Times, but<br />\nwaited for friends to pass him a<br />\nused copy. Herman drove his late<br />\nwife close to a breakdown in the<br />\nlast years of their marriage, then<br />\nelevated her to the level of a saint<br />\nposthumously. He may be a difficult man for us to love, but by<br />\nthe book's end we know Herman<br />\nRoth as well as we ever knew<br />\nAlexander Portnoy or Neil<br />\nKlugman.<br />\nThis same kind of brutal hones-<br /><br />\nty carries over into the author's<br />\nown personal life. Although he<br />\ndevotes little time to such matters,<br />\nit's not difficult to find a wealth<br />\nof blunt self-appraisal between<br />\nthe lines. The Philip Roth that<br />\ncomes out to us is constantly trying to take the high moral ground,<br />\nespecially when giving away his<br />\ninheritance or lying to his father<br />\nabout his emergency heart<br />\nsurgery.<br />\nOfcourse, not all ofPatrimony<br />\nis such sobering material. A good<br />\ndeal of Roth's audience know him<br />\nfrom the scathing and often<br />\nbawdy sense of humor he's<br />\ndisplayed in novels like Our<br />\nGang and Portnoy's Complaint.<br />\n(\"So you're Philip Roth,\" says<br />\none admiring widow to the author<br />\nin Patrimony. \"Thank you for all<br />\nthe laughs.\") Those who appreciate the slapstick and sarcasm<br />\nwill be pleased to note that Roth<br />\ncan find humor in even the most<br />\nmordant of situations; Patrimony,<br />\nlike a good deal of his work,<br />\nbalances on the line between<br />\ncomedy and tragedy.<br />\nSo, you might be wondering,<br />\nwhat is there to not recommend<br />\nabout Patrimony?<br />\nVery little, actually. Philip<br />\nRoth isn't striving to leap over<br />\nmountains with this book; at<br />\nmost, it's a humble tribute to the<br />\nman who reared him and a personal catharsis for the author. Yet<br />\nRoth makes his protagonist so<br />\nthree-dimensional and the prose<br />\nso smooth and readable, you'll<br />\nfind yourself racing through the<br />\nbook in one or two sittings.<br />\nPatrimony<br />\nby Philip Roth<br />\nSimon and Schuster<br />\n238 pages, $19.95<br /><br />\n8/MARCH 29, 1991<br /><br />\nThe 1991 Oscar Awards:<br /><br />\nClassless Action<br /><br />\nGlitz, Hype,and the Worst In Dental Hygiene<br />\nsaying \"and the Oscar goes our land.

The Blue<br />\nJays' head coach, Tony Seaman,<br />\nis 0-9 against the Orange after<br />\neight seasons at Penn. But<br />\nHopkins is one of only two teams<br />\nto defeat Syracuse in the last four<br />\nyears. But Hopkins never won in<br />\nthe Dome. But the Gaits are gone,<br />\nas are two other first team AllAmericans and nine other<br />\nOrangemen. But Syracuse is the<br />\nthree-time defending National<br />\nChampions and they've beaten<br />\nHopkins in five of their last six<br />\nmeetings. But Hopkins is the only<br />\nteam on the Syracuse schedule<br />\nwith a winning record against the<br />\nOrange (13-7-1).<br />\nMake that 14-7-1 now. In their<br />\nbiggest victory of the young<br />\nseason, Hopkins handily defeated<br />\nthe Orange 18-12 before a<br />\nstunned 'crowd of 10,936.<br />\nHopkins joined Cornell and Cortland (Seaman's Alma Mater) as<br />\nthe only teams to defeat Syracuse<br />\nin the Carrier Dome.

However, without Speno who launched a shot past<br />\nthe Gaits, the lone hold over the the shaky Syracuse goalie. The<br />\n\"Canadian Connection\" did not half ended 9-8 and the Jays were<br />\nhave enough support around him in the game largely due to Panetto lift Syracuse to victory.<br />\nta, who registered three goals and<br />\nSyracuse began where they left three assists in the first half, and<br />\noff last season. 1:20 into the junior goalie Scott Giardina, who<br />\ngame, number 22 wound up and played the best game of his career<br />\ncranked a shot.

Hopkins clinched the win<br />\nwhen Mike Kim won his match<br />\nat second singles, giving the Jays<br />\nfive wins in six singles matches.<br />\nHopkins had lost to Catholic each<br />\nof the past two seasons, in part<br />\ndue to injuries and absences on<br />\nthe day of the match. In Tuesday's match, in fact, the Jays<br />\nwere without Ted Roth, last<br /><br />\nyear's number three player, who<br />\nis injured. This year's team,<br />\nhowever, is so deep that it can<br />\nsurvive one or two missing<br />\nplayers.<br />\nAgainst Catholic, Lorin Engquist scored a quick 6-1, 6-3 win<br />\nat number one singles against an<br />\nopponent that he had beaten on<br />\ntwo previous occasions. The<br />\ndeliberate baseliner did attack on<br />\noccasion, almost exclusively to<br />\nhis opponent's weak backhand.<br />\nFor the most part, however, Engquist employed his usual strategy:<br />\nimitate a backboard.

At number<br />\nfour singles, Bill Braude was<br />\nunable to win his match, which<br />\nwent three sets to the surprise of<br />\nno one. Braude has gone three<br />\nsets in nine consecutive matches<br />\n(he's won six). Kanu Jerath, a<br />\nsophomore transfer student from<br />\nWilliams College, won in a<br />\nstrange match at fifth singles.

After performing sluggishly during a 4-5-1<br />\nFlorida road trip, the Jays returned in style, banging out eight<br />\nsingles and a pair of doubles in<br />\nan 8-3 win over St. John Fisher.<br />\nFreshman infielder Scott Cade<br />\nscored four times, and a pair of<br />\nsophomores, third baseman Sean<br />\nHolub and first baseman Matt<br />\nMertz, drove in two apiece to help<br />\nthe Jays break out of their offensive drought. Junior Digger<br />\nWalter(2-1) went the distance for<br />\nHopkins, yielding only six hits<br />\nand a walk while striking out five.<br />\nThe victory raised the team's<br />\noverall record to 7-8-1.<br />\nThe win over St. John Fisher<br />\nwas extremely satisfying,<br />\nespecially considering the general<br />\ndisappointment over the team's<br />\nplay in Florida. \"There were just<br />\nso many games in Florida in such<br />\na short period,\" said senior Brad<br />\nHerman. \"It was hard to keep our<br />\nconcentration from one game to<br /><br />\nthe next, and I think that's why<br />\nwe struggled.\"<br />\nA more tangible reason for the<br />\nJays' problems might have been<br />\nthe offense's collective slump,<br />\nand its inability to perform in the<br />\nclutch. As senior pitcher David<br />\nKiskis stated, \"We hit the ball<br />\npretty well as a whole, but just<br />\nnot when we needed to.\" In a 4-0<br />\nloss to Hobart, for example, the<br />\nJays scorched several balls, and<br />\nwere left with only two hits to<br />\nshow for their efforts.<br />\nOverall, despite the losing<br />\nrecord, the Florida trip was not<br />\na completely wasted experience.<br />\nThe pitching staff made tangible<br />\nprogress, as did many of the<br />\nyoung players. This was especially true in the infield, which<br />\nregularly starts two freshmen and<br />\ntwo sophomores. \"The key thing<br />\nis that our young players gained<br />\nexperience, and we can look forward to a strong second half,\"<br />\nWalter said.<br />\nTwo of the young infielders,<br />\nfreshmen Cade and Joe Kail,<br />\ncombined for eleven of the club's<br />\ntwenty-two stolen bases, pro-<br /><br />\nviding a much-needed infusion of<br />\nspeed. Menz (.310) and senior<br />\noutfielder Ken Brodkowski(.397)<br />\nhave supplied the power, with six<br />\nhomeruns and twenty-eight RBI<br />\nbetween them. Junior outfielder<br />\nMarzio Trotta (.386), senior outfielder Ken Krocenski (.372, 11<br />\nRBI), and senior catcher Pete<br />\nKwiterovich (.282) have been<br />\nsteady contributors.

Junior Jeff Fang is<br />\nonly 1-2 this season, but he sports<br />\na sparkling 2.25 earned run<br />\naverage.

After<br />\ngiving a separated shoulder the<br />\nopportunity to heal, the AllAmerican senior attackman<br />\nstepped forward with four goals<br />\nand two assists to continue<br />\nleading the Jays in scoring. Brendan Cody, also healing a sore arm<br />\nshowed why Seaman was so excited about bringing the Nassau<br />\nAll-American to Hopkins this<br />\nwinter. Two minutes into the<br />\nthird quarter, Cody put the Jays<br />\nahead with his first goal of the<br />\nseason. He added two more in the<br />\nfourth quarter as Hopkins put the<br />\ngame away with eight straight<br />\ngoals.<br />\nAsked about the slow start,<br />\nSeaman pointed to the quality of<br />\nshots taken in each half. \"We<br />\ndidn't change anything at<br />\nhalftime. In the first half, we had<br />\nsixteen shots but only six on<br />\ngoal,\" noted Seaman. The Jays<br />\ntook only seventeen shots in the<br />\nsecond half but this time thirteen<br />\nhit the six-by-six.<br />\nJeff Wills added two goals and<br />\none assist on the day. Rounding<br />\nout the scoring were Tierney<br />\n(1,2), Speno (1,1), Lukacz(1,0),<br />\nMike Morrissey (1,0) and Dave<br />\nBurns (0,1). Giardina played the<br />\nentire game in goal and recorded ten saves.<br /><br />\nWomen's Fencers 7th<br />\nat NIWFA Tourney<br />\nby Jessica Rosenbaum<br />\nOn Saturday, March 9th, the<br />\nwomen's fencing team placed<br />\nseventh (of thirteen) at Hunter<br />\nCollege in New York City in the<br />\nNational Intercollegiate Women's<br />\nFencing Association Championships (NIWFA).<br />\nCoach Gary Green was very<br />\npleased with the team's performance. He commented, \"The<br />\nNIWFA championship was a<br />\nvery positive way to end the<br />\nseason. We faced the same teams<br />\nthat we had competed against<br />\nearlier in the season and it was<br />\nevident that our team, as a whole,<br />\nhad improved.\"<br />\nThe NIWFA competition is set<br />\nup differently from most of the<br />\nother ,meets in the team's<br />\nschedule. Each member of the<br />\nteam is assigned a different<br />\n\"strip\" (A,B,C or D).

She won seven<br />\nmatches out of the ten or eleven<br />\nthat she played in the D strip,<br />\nAnne Korin also substituted in the<br />\nD strip,<br />\nIn the C strip competition,<br />\nLaura Greenwald did the bulk of<br />\nthe work, with some substitutions<br />\nfrom Allene Salcedo.

Swimming<br />\nagainst a field of more than 80<br />\nteams, the Hopkins' men finished in the top ten for the twentyfirst consecutive year with their<br />\nseventh place finish and the<br />\nfinished<br />\nwomen's<br />\nteam<br />\nthirteenth.<br />\nAlthough the men improved a<br />\nnotch from last year's eighth<br />\nplace finish, they did not have the<br />\nkind of meet they had hoped for<br />\nbecause of injuries and illnesses.<br />\nSophomore Eric Steidinger, a<br />\nconsistent performer for the team<br />\nall year, was sidelined with disc<br />\nproblems, and sophomore Jim<br />\nQuinn caught the flu at the meet,<br />\nbut competed in a reduced<br />\ncapacity,<br />\nDespite being hampered by<br />\nSteidinger's injury and Quinn's<br />\nillness, the men managed to<br />\nmaintain their competitive edge<br />\nby getting a number of outstanding individual performances.<br />\nSpearheading the effort for the<br />\nmen was junior Jay Smith who<br />\ntook fourth in the 100 yard<br />\nbackstroke, sixth in the 100 yard<br />\nfreestyle, and eight in the 50 yard<br />\nfreestyle.<br />\nSenior Steve Giangrandi<br />\nclosed out his successful diving<br />\ncareer at Hopkins by turning in<br />\nyet another outstanding performance. Giangrandi took fifth on<br />\nthe one meter diving board, and<br />\nseventh on the three meter board.<br /><br />\nIn addition to Giangrandi's effort,<br />\nthe men were also bolstered by<br />\nthe performances of freshman<br />\nJim Stefansic and Quinn. Stefansic finished sixth in the 400 yard<br />\nindividual medley and Quinn,<br />\nbattling the flu as well as the cornpetition, managed to finish fifteenth in the 200 yard<br />\nbreaststroke.<br />\nThe Hopkins women's team<br />\nfinished thirteenth this year,<br />\nwhich was down from their<br />\neleventh place finish of last year,<br />\nbut it is an ironic reversal of fortune which reflects how cornpetitive the field was this year at<br />\nNationals. The irony stems from<br />\nthe fact that although the women<br />\nimproved on their times from last<br />\nyear's finish, they actually finished lower this year because a<br />\nparticularly strong field led to a<br />\nfaster meet.<br />\n- The junior combination of Betsy Batchelor and Stephanie<br />\nDengler anchored the women's<br />\nteam at Nationals, as they had all<br />\nyear long. Dengler took sixth in<br />\nthe 1650 yard freestyle, tenth in<br />\nthe 400 yard individual medley,<br />\nand twelfth in the 500 yard<br />\nfreestyle, while Batchelor finished sixth in the 200 yard<br />\nbreaststroke and eighth in the 100<br />\nyard breaststroke. In addition to<br />\nDengler's and Batchelor's performances, the women's team<br />\nalso benefittekl from the efforts of<br />\nsenior Melanie Chellman who<br />\nfinished thirteenth in the 400 yard<br />\nindividual medley.<br />\nThe women's team also got a<br />\nboost at Nationals from its departing seniors Chellman, Wendy<br />\nFenstamaker, and Esther Chang,<br />\nwhose leadership and enthusiasm<br /><br />\n111<br /><br />\nINTERNSHIPS<br />\nLONDON<br />\nPARIS<br />\nWASHINGTON<br />\nSEMESTER/<br />\nACADEMIC YEAR<br /><br />\nFor program details complete the coupon below and mail it to:<br />\nBoston University<br />\nInternational Programs<br />\n232 Bay State Road<br />\nBoston, MA 02215<br />\n(617) 353-9888<br /><br />\nAddress<br />\nCity<br />\nPhone<br />\nCollege/University<br />\nSummer<br /><br />\nFall<br /><br />\nSpring 19_<br /><br />\nby Takashi Yokoyama<br />\nApplications for those interested in becoming members<br />\nof the Board are available at<br />\nthe cage.
