The Dean of Undergraduate Studies<br />\nmust attempt to integrate the undergraduate into an<br />\nadmittedly graduate-oriented institution. Swanson's<br />\nsuccessor must be chosen with care. He must be<br />\nsomeone who is genuinely interested in the undergraduate at Hopkins and is willing to use<br />\nimagination in order to make the undergraduate's<br />\neducation meaningful.<br />\nWe can think of no one better qualified to serve in this<br />\ncapacity than Dr. John S. Mann of the Education<br />\nDepartment. Dr. Mann's rapport with the undergraduate student is without parallel. He is on a firstname basis with many, all of whom describe him as one<br />\nof the few faculty members who seem to care about<br />\nundergraduates.<br />\nIn addition, Dr. Mann's discipline makes him ideally<br />\nsuited to occupy this position. He would be able to bring<br />\nto the Dean's office knowledge of the latest and most<br />\nprogressive ideas in education. Such information would<br />\nbe helpful in improving the tenuous position of the undergraduate on this campus.<br />\nFor many, the worst thing about the demise of the<br />\nEducation Department the departure of Dr. Mann. It is<br />\nnow clear that there is a way to rectify this situation. We<br />\nurge that the Student Council, the Temporary Advisory<br />\nCouncil and the Search Committee endorse Dr. Mann.<br />\nBut the final decision is up to Dean Benton. We are<br />\nconfident he will support this wise and logical choice.<br />\n<br />\nKent Moratorium<br />\nThe repression going on now at Kent State should be<br />\nthe concern of students everywhere. The Ohio grand<br />\njury, by indicting 25 students and exonerating the<br />\nNational Guard, is trying to justify the slaughter of four<br />\nstudents last May. The warning in this bid to stifle<br />\nfreedom is clear: they can get us for anything they<br />\nwant.<br />\nTo students, nothing seemed more outrageous than<br />\nthe trigger-happy response of the Ohio National Guard<br />\nto protests. Furthermore, both the Scranton Commission and the FBI strongly condemned the National<br />\nGuard. So, by somehow making a clear case of government abuse the fault of the students, the Ohio grand jury<br />\nhopes to frighten other students away from protest, and<br />\ncurb the traditional liberty of universities. This scareand-punish response has already been used by the<br />\nFederal government in their indictment of radical<br />\nleaders after the Chicago police riots. The pattern will<br />\nundoubtedly continue, until every outbreak of mindless<br />\nstate violence will be followed by the arrest of the victims.<br />\nWith frustrated Middle America demanding a tough<br />\napproach to protestors, we can expect only more<br />\npolitical trials and more threats against our liberties.<br />\nUnfortunately, the left tends to become paralyzed when<br />\nthis danger is greatest. We cannot permit a repeat of the<br />\nMcCarthy era, when careers were broken and the<br />\nConstitution ignored in the hysterical drive to crush the<br />\nReds. And a start towards resisting the new madness is<br />\nthe call by Kent State student leaders for a national<br />\nmoratorium today.<br />\nWe urge all members of the Hopkins community to<br />\nback this moratorium as a show of support for the indicted students. Also, we join in the call by the Kent<br />\nstudent and faculty organizations for a Federal grand<br />\njury investigation into the events of last May. Perhaps,<br />\nby standing together, we can begin to stem the angry<br />\ntide of repression.<br />\n<br />\nFight the Fed. Monster<br />\nBy MARK DERR<br />\nIt would seem that in a period which sees<br />\nunrest prevalent throughout the world and a<br />\nwidespread questioning of the nature and<br />\nrole of the university in society there should<br />\nbe a serious debate concerning the future of<br />\nThe John Hopkins University.<br />\nBut, there is no such debate. We, the<br />\ncitizens of this nation and members of the<br />\n\"Hopkins Community\", have for many<br />\nyears now heard talk on the part of liberal<br />\nintellectuals and others of the need for reordering national priorities and we have<br />\nseen some small movement in that direction<br />\n-- at least now more people are talking about,<br />\nthat idea.<br />\nBut we see no large scale discussion within<br />\nthis particular segment of society, which<br />\nseems to be more closely tied to the national<br />\nsuperstructure than any of us had assumed,<br />\nconcerning a reordering of its own priorities.<br />\nIt is my belief -- and I hope that of others -that on the eve of its 100th birthday the<br />\nmembers of the Hopkins community should<br />\nlook into the present structure of the<br />\nUniversity, which now receives 53% of its<br />\nbudget from the Federal Government<br />\n(News- Letter, 10/ 20), with respect to the<br />\nway it is run and the nature and extent of its<br />\ncommittment both to teaching and to<br />\nresearch.

In a word, this<br />\nUniversity has become a somewhat<br />\nglamorized business -- and a big business at<br />\nthat.<br />\nNot all of the changes that occured were in<br />\nthe realm of pursuing contracts. Some were<br />\ninstituted in the belief that they would further the cause of higher education \"in these<br />\nUnited States.\" Despite the nature or<br />\nreasons for the many changes which have<br />\noccured, it seems that the most notable in<br />\nrecent years is this University's surrender of<br />\nits freedom to the Government.<br />\nThat is to say that the University has<br />\nunwittingly and now, it seems, willingly sold<br />\nits soul to Mammon and Mars. Regardless<br />\nof our opinions concerning these changes we<br />\nshould all commit ourselves to a critical<br />\nexamination of our reasons for existence as<br />\na University community.<br />\nWe should commit ourselves to an attempt<br />\nto determine where this University stands in<br />\nrelation to society as a whole and its various<br />\nsegments, in relation to the federal government, and where each group in the com-<br />\n<br />\nmunity - undergraduates, graduate<br />\nstudends, trustees, faculty, administrators,<br />\nemployees, and others - stand in relation to<br />\nthe whole.<br />\nJanuary Minimester<br />\nI propose that the January Minimester be<br />\nset aside for a true educational experience. I<br />\npropose that the University call for a month<br />\nof seminars and convocations to be attended<br />\nby everyone associated with the University<br />\nand interested in its future.<br />\nThat means that representatives of the<br />\ngovernment - state, local, and federal -- the<br />\ntrustees, administrators, faculty members,<br />\nstudents, employees, and all others<br />\nassociated with this University would be<br />\ninvited to attend and participate on an equal<br />\nbasis. Any final proposals should be ratified<br />\nby the entire University Community in<br />\naccordance with the democratic principle of<br />\n\"one man, one vote.\"<br />\nThe purpose of this month of debate would<br />\nhopefully be to come up with proposals the<br />\nUniversity could pursue in the future, if it<br />\nshould so choose. Of course, it is possible<br />\nthat the oligarchy which rules this<br />\nUniversity may choose not to allow the<br />\nUniversity - that is the members of the<br />\ncommunity - to attempt to determine its own<br />\nfuture.<br />\nPerhaps they would rather see it die<br />\nnoiselessly. By this I mean that they may<br />\nchoose to sit back and watch the University<br />\nbe swallowed by the Federal Monster - perhaps we all would. After a month of<br />\ndebate it may be decided that the University<br />\nis destined to fall into the jaws of that beast.<br />\nIf such a decision is reached, it must then<br />\nbe decided whether the University should<br />\nbow to the inevitable, in which case steps<br />\nshould be taken to abolish the student body<br />\nand change the name to The Johns Hopkins<br />\nResearch Institute, or whether it should sit<br />\nback, raise ulcers, and pray for a better day.<br />\nOf course, if it really wanted to be radical<br />\nand assert its independence, it could fight -God forbid! If we fight the monster now,<br />\nchances are he will slaughter us right away;<br />\nwhereas, if we bow to his demands, he<br />\nmight,\"by the grace of God,\" decide to keep<br />\nus as a pet.<br />\nOn second thought, perhaps we should not<br />\nmeet, because we might decide to fight the<br />\nFederal Monster, and a few others as well.<br />\nNo, perhaps we should continue to allow<br />\nourselves to be swept along by the tide of<br />\ncircumstances. We might get hurt, if we<br />\ndare to say no, if we attempt to seize control.<br />\nWhy should we not continue to abolish one<br />\ndepartment after another in the name of<br />\nefficiency and economy?<br />\n<br />\nMark Derr is a Junior, majoring in English.<br />\n<br />\nLetters to the Editors<br />\nRomance<br />\nEditors:<br />\nTo the<br />\nNot all undergraduates at<br />\nHopkins are apathetic.<br />\nDuring last year's minisemester, students worked on<br />\na play which was presented in<br />\nFrench at the Barn.

It was the<br />\nGoucher Hopkins Symphony<br />\nrehearsing for the opening of<br />\nits sixth season this Sunday at<br />\n8:30 p.m. at Kraushaar<br />\nAuditorium.<br />\nAdmission is free.<br />\nThe Goucher-Hopkins<br />\nS ymphony began, humbly<br />\nenough, with 20 players as a<br />\nGoucher chamber orchestra<br />\nwhich conductor Daniel<br />\nAbrams started at the<br />\n<br />\nrequest of students. By its<br />\nfourth year it had grown to<br />\nfull symphony size and last<br />\nyear the Hopkins Symphony<br />\nwas merged with it.<br />\nThe symphony now lacks<br />\nonly the few extra strings,<br />\npercussionists, and unusual<br />\ninstrument players of a<br />\nprofessional 90-piece orchestra.<br />\nbeginning<br />\nthe<br />\nFrom<br />\nAbrams refused y make the<br />\nsymphony an institutional<br />\norganization because he<br />\nwanted \"to get those who can<br />\nplay.\" Therefore, while half<br />\nof the symphony comes from<br />\nGoucher or Hopkins, the<br />\nother half is drawn from all<br />\nover the community and<br />\nand<br />\nPeabody<br />\nincludes<br />\nMorgan State students, music<br />\nteachers, professionals and<br />\nretired musicians. Lincoln<br />\nGordon is lured by the chance<br />\n<br />\nrecognition:<br />\n\"We used to play in a<br />\nlecture hall which holds about<br />\n240. By the end of the season it<br />\nwas filled. Now the big hall is<br />\nfilled.\"<br />\n<br />\nto test his cello technique<br />\nagainst the demands of<br />\nBeethoven and Mr. Abrams.<br />\nSpirit is what sets the<br />\nsymphony apart. \"Their<br />\nenthusiasm is uncanny,\"<br />\nconductor Abrams says of the<br />\nmembers. Abrams, however,<br />\nis no amateur himself. As a<br />\nprofessional pianist he has<br />\ntoured Europe and South<br />\nAmerica and he has conducted opera and, ballet in<br />\nEurope. He is now a member<br />\nof the music faculty at<br />\nGoucher.<br />\nIn his opinion the members<br />\nof the symphony have grown<br />\nin more than just number.<br />\n\"They sight read as well, if<br />\nnot better, than when we used<br />\nto work something up,\" he<br />\nsays. He credits such things<br />\nas\u2014 extra string rehearsals<br />\nwith taking out a lot of the<br />\nrough spots. It has paid off in<br />\n<br />\nThe symphony performs<br />\nworks from the standard<br />\n'orchestral repertoire and<br />\nsome people have asked Mr.<br />\nAbrams how he can have the<br />\nnerve to play Beethoven's<br />\nFifth. \"If you don't have the<br />\nnerve,\" he replies, \"how can<br />\nyou play anything?\" Besides,<br />\nhe points out, \"the literature<br />\nfor this size orchestra is just<br />\nnot easy.\"<br />\nSome people have told him<br />\nthey've given up their<br />\nBaltimore Symphony Orchestra subscription to come<br />\nto the Goucher-Hopkins<br />\nSymphony concerts instead.<br />\nThe reason, he thinks, is<br />\nsimply that \"they would<br />\nrather see the spirit and love<br />\n<br />\nGRADUATE SCHOOL INTERVIEWS<br />\n<br />\nof these people than a<br />\nprofessional orchestra.\"<br />\nThis Sunday's program<br />\nincludes Brahms' Variations<br />\non a Theme by Haydn,<br />\nAbrams' Cantata Concerning<br />\na Hero and Beethoven's Fifth<br />\nSymphony in C Minor.<br />\nto<br />\nthe dilemma of liberal senators: Why not vote for a bill<br />\nthat would authorize the<br />\nconstruction of missiles that<br />\nwould reach exactly as far as<br />\nCairo, but<br />\nFor a free copy of<br />\nnot a mile<br />\nNATIONAL REfurther?\"<br />\nVIEW, write: Dept.<br />\n<br />\n\"A PROPOSED SOLUTION<br />\n<br />\nT, 150 E. 35 Street,<br />\nN.

One of them is the<br />\nfact we have never been able<br />\nto beat the Tigers. With a<br />\ngood effort, the chances are<br />\nnot impossible.<br />\n<br />\nPitts: Down But Not Out<br />\n<br />\nBy JAY LENROW<br />\nAs many students are by now aware,<br />\nsophomore quarterback Jim Pitts was<br />\nseriously injured this past Saturday in a<br />\nfootball game against Haverford College.<br />\nBecause of the pounding he received, he<br />\nwas in surgery late into Saturday evening<br />\nand had his spleen and one kidney removed.<br />\nThis has effectively ended his sports career.<br />\nJim played his high school ball at Kenwood<br />\nHigh School in Baltimore County. When I<br />\ncontacted his old coach Charles Geis, the<br />\nfeelings toward Jim were essentially the<br />\nsame as voiced by almost every other person<br />\nwho knows him. Geis had nothing but praise<br />\nfor his former starting quarterback.<br />\nPitts came to Kenwood in his junior year<br />\nand soon became the starting varsity<br />\nquarterback. He also lettered in basketball<br />\nand baseball that year.<br />\nIn his senior year, Pitts was injured after<br />\nplaying only three games but recovered in<br />\ntime to letter in basketball and to switch to<br />\nthe varsity lacrosse team.<br />\nThe general impression given by Pitts'<br />\ncoaches was that he has been the team<br />\nleader in most of the sports that he has<br />\nplayed. He was the recipient of the Blanch<br />\nDrenna Award, given annually to the outstanding senior athlete of Kenwood in his<br />\nthree year sports career.<br />\n\u2022 As Coach Charles Geis remarked, \"He<br />\nmay not have been the best athlete that ever<br />\nplayed for me, but he was certainly one of<br />\nthe finest people I have ever met.\"<br />\nAs a freshman last year, Jim participated<br />\nin football and lacrosse. He was an outstanding quarterback and punter and was<br />\none of the reasons that the Baby Jays did so<br />\n<br />\nwell last year. On lacrosse he was one of the<br />\nmainstays of a fine frosh team and was<br />\ncounted on heavily to play on the varsity this<br />\nyear.<br />\nPitts came to football practice this fall<br />\nwith a good attitude and it was quickly<br />\nevident that he would be a threat to senior<br />\nBob Pfieffer as a quarterback. Pitts started<br />\nthe first game but was eventually switched<br />\nto half-back where he was needed more.<br />\nWhen speaking about him, Coach Alex<br />\nSotir stated, \"Jim's most valua., \u2022 assets<br />\nwere not his ability but the enthusiasm he<br />\nbrought to the sport. As well as he did during<br />\nhis career, he could never do more than his<br />\nenthusiasm was able to accomplish.\"<br />\nHopkins' athletic trainer, known to most<br />\npeople as Brandy, summed upr ' -general<br />\nfeelings when he said, \"There are a lot ol<br />\nother people I would rather see get hurt than<br />\nPitts.\"<br />\nThe entire unfortunate incident could have<br />\nbeen avoided if there had been referees with<br />\nsome semblance of competence. Throughout<br />\nthe entire game they seemed to turn their<br />\nbacks on serious infractions of the rules<br />\npromulgated by the Ha verford squad. In the<br />\ncase of Jim Pitts he was hit twice after the<br />\nreferees had blown the play dead in clear<br />\nviolation of all rules of fair play and sportsmanship. The result, as is now known, was<br />\nserious injury.<br />\nWe can only ask that Marshall Turner as<br />\nthe Director of Athletics sees to it that the<br />\nreferees used in Saturday's game are never<br />\nused again and that he write a letter to the<br />\nMiddle-Atlantic Conference stating exactly<br />\nwily Hopkins won't employ them any more.<br />\n<br />\nNEWS-LETTER<br />\n<br />\nSPORTS<br />\nGettysburg Contest<br />\n<br />\nRooters Beaten In Mud<br />\nBy STEVE BARTLETT<br />\nlast<br />\nuse<br />\nto<br />\nHoping<br />\nSatruday's trouncing of<br />\nSwarthmore as a take off<br />\npoint, the Jays were defeated<br />\nin a disappointing 3-2 loss in<br />\nthe rain at Gettysburg<br />\nCollege Wednesday.<br />\nThe game was played in a<br />\ncontinual downpour as both<br />\nteams were slowed by the<br />\nmud and the slippery turf.<br />\nDespite the conditions, Jays<br />\nwere able to put on their most<br />\naggressive offensive showing<br />\nof the year in the second<br />\nquarter, pelting the Bullet<br />\ngoalie with shots from all<br />\nsides.<br />\nNevertheless, Gettysburg<br />\ngot the scoring under way in<br />\nthe second period after an<br />\nuneventful first period that<br />\nsaw players sliding all over<br />\nthe field.

The Dean of Undergraduate Studies<br />\nmust attempt to integrate the undergraduate into an<br />\nadmittedly graduate-oriented institution. Swanson's<br />\nsuccessor must be chosen with care. He must be<br />\nsomeone who is genuinely interested in the undergraduate at Hopkins and is willing to use<br />\nimagination in order to make the undergraduate's<br />\neducation meaningful.<br />\nWe can think of no one better qualified to serve in this<br />\ncapacity than Dr. John S. Mann of the Education<br />\nDepartment. Dr. Mann's rapport with the undergraduate student is without parallel. He is on a firstname basis with many, all of whom describe him as one<br />\nof the few faculty members who seem to care about<br />\nundergraduates.<br />\nIn addition, Dr. Mann's discipline makes him ideally<br />\nsuited to occupy this position. He would be able to bring<br />\nto the Dean's office knowledge of the latest and most<br />\nprogressive ideas in education. Such information would<br />\nbe helpful in improving the tenuous position of the undergraduate on this campus.<br />\nFor many, the worst thing about the demise of the<br />\nEducation Department the departure of Dr. Mann. It is<br />\nnow clear that there is a way to rectify this situation. We<br />\nurge that the Student Council, the Temporary Advisory<br />\nCouncil and the Search Committee endorse Dr. Mann.<br />\nBut the final decision is up to Dean Benton. We are<br />\nconfident he will support this wise and logical choice.<br /><br />\nKent Moratorium<br />\nThe repression going on now at Kent State should be<br />\nthe concern of students everywhere. The Ohio grand<br />\njury, by indicting 25 students and exonerating the<br />\nNational Guard, is trying to justify the slaughter of four<br />\nstudents last May. The warning in this bid to stifle<br />\nfreedom is clear: they can get us for anything they<br />\nwant.<br />\nTo students, nothing seemed more outrageous than<br />\nthe trigger-happy response of the Ohio National Guard<br />\nto protests. Furthermore, both the Scranton Commission and the FBI strongly condemned the National<br />\nGuard. So, by somehow making a clear case of government abuse the fault of the students, the Ohio grand jury<br />\nhopes to frighten other students away from protest, and<br />\ncurb the traditional liberty of universities. This scareand-punish response has already been used by the<br />\nFederal government in their indictment of radical<br />\nleaders after the Chicago police riots. The pattern will<br />\nundoubtedly continue, until every outbreak of mindless<br />\nstate violence will be followed by the arrest of the victims.<br />\nWith frustrated Middle America demanding a tough<br />\napproach to protestors, we can expect only more<br />\npolitical trials and more threats against our liberties.<br />\nUnfortunately, the left tends to become paralyzed when<br />\nthis danger is greatest. We cannot permit a repeat of the<br />\nMcCarthy era, when careers were broken and the<br />\nConstitution ignored in the hysterical drive to crush the<br />\nReds. And a start towards resisting the new madness is<br />\nthe call by Kent State student leaders for a national<br />\nmoratorium today.<br />\nWe urge all members of the Hopkins community to<br />\nback this moratorium as a show of support for the indicted students. Also, we join in the call by the Kent<br />\nstudent and faculty organizations for a Federal grand<br />\njury investigation into the events of last May. Perhaps,<br />\nby standing together, we can begin to stem the angry<br />\ntide of repression.<br /><br />\nFight the Fed. Monster<br />\nBy MARK DERR<br />\nIt would seem that in a period which sees<br />\nunrest prevalent throughout the world and a<br />\nwidespread questioning of the nature and<br />\nrole of the university in society there should<br />\nbe a serious debate concerning the future of<br />\nThe John Hopkins University.<br />\nBut, there is no such debate. We, the<br />\ncitizens of this nation and members of the<br />\n\"Hopkins Community\", have for many<br />\nyears now heard talk on the part of liberal<br />\nintellectuals and others of the need for reordering national priorities and we have<br />\nseen some small movement in that direction<br />\n-- at least now more people are talking about,<br />\nthat idea.<br />\nBut we see no large scale discussion within<br />\nthis particular segment of society, which<br />\nseems to be more closely tied to the national<br />\nsuperstructure than any of us had assumed,<br />\nconcerning a reordering of its own priorities.<br />\nIt is my belief -- and I hope that of others -that on the eve of its 100th birthday the<br />\nmembers of the Hopkins community should<br />\nlook into the present structure of the<br />\nUniversity, which now receives 53% of its<br />\nbudget from the Federal Government<br />\n(News- Letter, 10/ 20), with respect to the<br />\nway it is run and the nature and extent of its<br />\ncommittment both to teaching and to<br />\nresearch. We should undertake this investigation in an attempt to determine the<br />\ndirection it should follow in the future.<br />\nContractor and Slumlord<br />\nThis University was established in 1876 for<br />\na purpose, that being one of education past<br />\nthe B.A. and B.S. and academic research.<br />\nSince its founding it has undergone many<br />\nchanges. It has become a military contractor and slumlord. In a word, this<br />\nUniversity has become a somewhat<br />\nglamorized business -- and a big business at<br />\nthat.<br />\nNot all of the changes that occured were in<br />\nthe realm of pursuing contracts. Some were<br />\ninstituted in the belief that they would further the cause of higher education \"in these<br />\nUnited States.\" Despite the nature or<br />\nreasons for the many changes which have<br />\noccured, it seems that the most notable in<br />\nrecent years is this University's surrender of<br />\nits freedom to the Government.<br />\nThat is to say that the University has<br />\nunwittingly and now, it seems, willingly sold<br />\nits soul to Mammon and Mars. Regardless<br />\nof our opinions concerning these changes we<br />\nshould all commit ourselves to a critical<br />\nexamination of our reasons for existence as<br />\na University community.<br />\nWe should commit ourselves to an attempt<br />\nto determine where this University stands in<br />\nrelation to society as a whole and its various<br />\nsegments, in relation to the federal government, and where each group in the com-<br /><br />\nmunity - undergraduates, graduate<br />\nstudends, trustees, faculty, administrators,<br />\nemployees, and others - stand in relation to<br />\nthe whole.<br />\nJanuary Minimester<br />\nI propose that the January Minimester be<br />\nset aside for a true educational experience. I<br />\npropose that the University call for a month<br />\nof seminars and convocations to be attended<br />\nby everyone associated with the University<br />\nand interested in its future.<br />\nThat means that representatives of the<br />\ngovernment - state, local, and federal -- the<br />\ntrustees, administrators, faculty members,<br />\nstudents, employees, and all others<br />\nassociated with this University would be<br />\ninvited to attend and participate on an equal<br />\nbasis. Any final proposals should be ratified<br />\nby the entire University Community in<br />\naccordance with the democratic principle of<br />\n\"one man, one vote.\"<br />\nThe purpose of this month of debate would<br />\nhopefully be to come up with proposals the<br />\nUniversity could pursue in the future, if it<br />\nshould so choose. Of course, it is possible<br />\nthat the oligarchy which rules this<br />\nUniversity may choose not to allow the<br />\nUniversity - that is the members of the<br />\ncommunity - to attempt to determine its own<br />\nfuture.<br />\nPerhaps they would rather see it die<br />\nnoiselessly. By this I mean that they may<br />\nchoose to sit back and watch the University<br />\nbe swallowed by the Federal Monster - perhaps we all would.

It was the<br />\nGoucher Hopkins Symphony<br />\nrehearsing for the opening of<br />\nits sixth season this Sunday at<br />\n8:30 p.m. at Kraushaar<br />\nAuditorium.<br />\nAdmission is free.<br />\nThe Goucher-Hopkins<br />\nS ymphony began, humbly<br />\nenough, with 20 players as a<br />\nGoucher chamber orchestra<br />\nwhich conductor Daniel<br />\nAbrams started at the<br /><br />\nrequest of students. By its<br />\nfourth year it had grown to<br />\nfull symphony size and last<br />\nyear the Hopkins Symphony<br />\nwas merged with it.<br />\nThe symphony now lacks<br />\nonly the few extra strings,<br />\npercussionists, and unusual<br />\ninstrument players of a<br />\nprofessional 90-piece orchestra.<br />\nbeginning<br />\nthe<br />\nFrom<br />\nAbrams refused y make the<br />\nsymphony an institutional<br />\norganization because he<br />\nwanted \"to get those who can<br />\nplay.\" Therefore, while half<br />\nof the symphony comes from<br />\nGoucher or Hopkins, the<br />\nother half is drawn from all<br />\nover the community and<br />\nand<br />\nPeabody<br />\nincludes<br />\nMorgan State students, music<br />\nteachers, professionals and<br />\nretired musicians. Lincoln<br />\nGordon is lured by the chance<br /><br />\nrecognition:<br />\n\"We used to play in a<br />\nlecture hall which holds about<br />\n240. By the end of the season it<br />\nwas filled. Now the big hall is<br />\nfilled.\"<br /><br />\nto test his cello technique<br />\nagainst the demands of<br />\nBeethoven and Mr. Abrams.<br />\nSpirit is what sets the<br />\nsymphony apart. \"Their<br />\nenthusiasm is uncanny,\"<br />\nconductor Abrams says of the<br />\nmembers. Abrams, however,<br />\nis no amateur himself. As a<br />\nprofessional pianist he has<br />\ntoured Europe and South<br />\nAmerica and he has conducted opera and, ballet in<br />\nEurope. He is now a member<br />\nof the music faculty at<br />\nGoucher.<br />\nIn his opinion the members<br />\nof the symphony have grown<br />\nin more than just number.<br />\n\"They sight read as well, if<br />\nnot better, than when we used<br />\nto work something up,\" he<br />\nsays. He credits such things<br />\nas\u2014 extra string rehearsals<br />\nwith taking out a lot of the<br />\nrough spots. It has paid off in<br /><br />\nThe symphony performs<br />\nworks from the standard<br />\n'orchestral repertoire and<br />\nsome people have asked Mr.<br />\nAbrams how he can have the<br />\nnerve to play Beethoven's<br />\nFifth. \"If you don't have the<br />\nnerve,\" he replies, \"how can<br />\nyou play anything?\" Besides,<br />\nhe points out, \"the literature<br />\nfor this size orchestra is just<br />\nnot easy.\"<br />\nSome people have told him<br />\nthey've given up their<br />\nBaltimore Symphony Orchestra subscription to come<br />\nto the Goucher-Hopkins<br />\nSymphony concerts instead.<br />\nThe reason, he thinks, is<br />\nsimply that \"they would<br />\nrather see the spirit and love<br /><br />\nGRADUATE SCHOOL INTERVIEWS<br /><br />\nof these people than a<br />\nprofessional orchestra.\"<br />\nThis Sunday's program<br />\nincludes Brahms' Variations<br />\non a Theme by Haydn,<br />\nAbrams' Cantata Concerning<br />\na Hero and Beethoven's Fifth<br />\nSymphony in C Minor.<br />\nto<br />\nthe dilemma of liberal senators: Why not vote for a bill<br />\nthat would authorize the<br />\nconstruction of missiles that<br />\nwould reach exactly as far as<br />\nCairo, but<br />\nFor a free copy of<br />\nnot a mile<br />\nNATIONAL REfurther?\"<br />\nVIEW, write: Dept.<br /><br />\n\"A PROPOSED SOLUTION<br /><br />\nT, 150 E. 35 Street,<br />\nN.

One of them is the<br />\nfact we have never been able<br />\nto beat the Tigers. With a<br />\ngood effort, the chances are<br />\nnot impossible.<br /><br />\nPitts: Down But Not Out<br /><br />\nBy JAY LENROW<br />\nAs many students are by now aware,<br />\nsophomore quarterback Jim Pitts was<br />\nseriously injured this past Saturday in a<br />\nfootball game against Haverford College.<br />\nBecause of the pounding he received, he<br />\nwas in surgery late into Saturday evening<br />\nand had his spleen and one kidney removed.<br />\nThis has effectively ended his sports career.<br />\nJim played his high school ball at Kenwood<br />\nHigh School in Baltimore County. When I<br />\ncontacted his old coach Charles Geis, the<br />\nfeelings toward Jim were essentially the<br />\nsame as voiced by almost every other person<br />\nwho knows him. Geis had nothing but praise<br />\nfor his former starting quarterback.<br />\nPitts came to Kenwood in his junior year<br />\nand soon became the starting varsity<br />\nquarterback. He also lettered in basketball<br />\nand baseball that year.<br />\nIn his senior year, Pitts was injured after<br />\nplaying only three games but recovered in<br />\ntime to letter in basketball and to switch to<br />\nthe varsity lacrosse team.<br />\nThe general impression given by Pitts'<br />\ncoaches was that he has been the team<br />\nleader in most of the sports that he has<br />\nplayed. He was the recipient of the Blanch<br />\nDrenna Award, given annually to the outstanding senior athlete of Kenwood in his<br />\nthree year sports career.<br />\n\u2022 As Coach Charles Geis remarked, \"He<br />\nmay not have been the best athlete that ever<br />\nplayed for me, but he was certainly one of<br />\nthe finest people I have ever met.\"<br />\nAs a freshman last year, Jim participated<br />\nin football and lacrosse. He was an outstanding quarterback and punter and was<br />\none of the reasons that the Baby Jays did so<br /><br />\nwell last year. On lacrosse he was one of the<br />\nmainstays of a fine frosh team and was<br />\ncounted on heavily to play on the varsity this<br />\nyear.<br />\nPitts came to football practice this fall<br />\nwith a good attitude and it was quickly<br />\nevident that he would be a threat to senior<br />\nBob Pfieffer as a quarterback. Pitts started<br />\nthe first game but was eventually switched<br />\nto half-back where he was needed more.<br />\nWhen speaking about him, Coach Alex<br />\nSotir stated, \"Jim's most valua., \u2022 assets<br />\nwere not his ability but the enthusiasm he<br />\nbrought to the sport. As well as he did during<br />\nhis career, he could never do more than his<br />\nenthusiasm was able to accomplish.\"<br />\nHopkins' athletic trainer, known to most<br />\npeople as Brandy, summed upr ' -general<br />\nfeelings when he said, \"There are a lot ol<br />\nother people I would rather see get hurt than<br />\nPitts.\"<br />\nThe entire unfortunate incident could have<br />\nbeen avoided if there had been referees with<br />\nsome semblance of competence. Throughout<br />\nthe entire game they seemed to turn their<br />\nbacks on serious infractions of the rules<br />\npromulgated by the Ha verford squad. In the<br />\ncase of Jim Pitts he was hit twice after the<br />\nreferees had blown the play dead in clear<br />\nviolation of all rules of fair play and sportsmanship. The result, as is now known, was<br />\nserious injury.<br />\nWe can only ask that Marshall Turner as<br />\nthe Director of Athletics sees to it that the<br />\nreferees used in Saturday's game are never<br />\nused again and that he write a letter to the<br />\nMiddle-Atlantic Conference stating exactly<br />\nwily Hopkins won't employ them any more.<br /><br />\nNEWS-LETTER<br /><br />\nSPORTS<br />\nGettysburg Contest<br /><br />\nRooters Beaten In Mud<br />\nBy STEVE BARTLETT<br />\nlast<br />\nuse<br />\nto<br />\nHoping<br />\nSatruday's trouncing of<br />\nSwarthmore as a take off<br />\npoint, the Jays were defeated<br />\nin a disappointing 3-2 loss in<br />\nthe rain at Gettysburg<br />\nCollege Wednesday.<br />\nThe game was played in a<br />\ncontinual downpour as both<br />\nteams were slowed by the<br />\nmud and the slippery turf.<br />\nDespite the conditions, Jays<br />\nwere able to put on their most<br />\naggressive offensive showing<br />\nof the year in the second<br />\nquarter, pelting the Bullet<br />\ngoalie with shots from all<br />\nsides.<br />\nNevertheless, Gettysburg<br />\ngot the scoring under way in<br />\nthe second period after an<br />\nuneventful first period that<br />\nsaw players sliding all over<br />\nthe field. The Bullets' Steve<br />\nfilmy managed to boot an<br />\nunassisted goal past Hopkins<br />\ngoalie Steve Weiss.<br />\nThe Jays came right back<br />\nwith the tying goal as wing<br />\nKeith Ross converted a<br />\nScott<br />\nperfect pass from<br /><br />\nTyner into a goal. The Jays<br />\nthen really put the presure on<br />\nbut were unable to score.<br />\nThe third period proved<br />\nmuch like the first with both<br />\nteams missing good opportunities to score.<br />\nThe Bullets scored early in<br />\nthe fourth quarter as Brian<br />\nWright headed in a corner<br />\nkick with Gettysburg's Mike<br />\nShaver following close behind<br />\nwith another goal.
