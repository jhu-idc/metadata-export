Her<br />\naccession came at a time of flux and<br />\nuncertainty for Goucher\u2014 the college had<br />\nrejected a merger offerfrom Hopkins, had<br />\nvowed to eschew coeducation for at least<br />\n10 years, and faced greater financial<br />\ndiflculties than ever.<br />\nNews-Letter: First of all, what do you<br />\nsee as your primary function<br />\nas President of Goucher College, a small<br />\nliberal arts College in a stage of<br />\ntransition?<br />\nRhoda Dorsey: Well, you know this<br />\ntransition point is an interesting one. I<br />\n.think the transition point was last year.<br />\nAs far as I'm concerned, the decisions<br />\nmade last year signaled certain kinds of<br />\ndirections in which the college will be<br />\npreceeding in the future, and its my job<br />\nto insure that those directions are<br />\nfollowed as rapidly and effectively for the<br />\nCollege as possible. In fact, what that<br />\nmeans, is that I do a whole mess of things<br />\nhaving to deal with keeping the enterprise<br />\nalive, just as your president does. That<br />\nmeans keeping a general weather eye on<br />\nall things that go on on campus. It means<br />\nbeing the contact person between the<br />\ncollege and are kinds of outside worlds.<br />\nAnd it means heading up attempts to get<br />\nfinancial support for the college. I think<br />\nthat those are the kind of major<br />\nresponsibilities that pretty much all<br />\nCollege Presidents have to deal with.<br />\nN-L: How important is getting<br />\nfinancial assistance for the College? How<br />\nmuch of your time does that occupy?<br />\nDorsey: I'm not really terribly good at<br />\ntelling you _what percentage of time. It's<br />\napt to seem to occupy more time than it<br />\ndoes, because alot of getting financial<br />\nsupport involves traveling to a point Iso it<br />\nmay take you a couple of days, where the<br />\nactual discussion with a donor, a<br />\npotential donor may only last for an<br />\nhour, a half an hour, so that its apt to<br />\nconsume blocks of time. which make it<br />\nappear to be the all-consuming mission in<br />\nlife. I don't really think this is the case,<br />\nbut it's obviously pretty important. Its<br />\nimportant to us because three years ago<br />\nwe started a capital campaign which was<br />\nto run in two phases. The first was to<br />\nconcentrate on the Baltimore area where<br />\nthe largest single percentage of Goucher<br />\nalumni lived! The second was to be a<br />\nnational campaign, focusing on all parents<br />\nand alumni across the country. Now the<br />\nfirst phase was about over when Mr. Perry<br />\n[Marvin Perry, Dorsey's predecessor as<br />\nPresident] resigned and last year while I<br />\nwas acting president there was a decision<br />\nthat the national phase would not be<br />\ncontinued. It was viewed as not a good<br />\nthing to go about nationally without a<br />\npermanent President. So that as soon as<br />\nmy presidency was announced,as last the<br />\nnational phase began. And in fact, that is<br />\nwhat we are embarked on now. And that<br />\nmeans in the course of this year in<br />\nconjunction with that cornpaign. I will be<br />\ngoing to various parts of the country<br />\nseeking support.<br />\nN-L: Do you have any goal in mind as<br />\nto how much you want to raise?<br />\nDorsey: Well, the goal that was<br />\noriginally set forth for the campaign was<br />\nS10 million. Not quite like the Hopkins<br />\nHundreds. Just as well when you're trying<br />\nto reach it.<br />\nN-L: What would be the main capital<br />\nimprovement? Any new buildings'?<br />\nDorsey: No. this is not a campaign that<br />\nwas designed for buildings at all. It was<br />\nfor money to go into such things as<br />\n<br />\nimproving faculty salaries, expanding the<br />\nfinancial support available to the college<br />\nfor students, giving support to new<br />\nprograms, to the library, and a lovely one<br />\nwhich is called contingency, the<br />\nPresident's purse-for nice lovely projects.<br />\nBut it's all a people's campaign, not a<br />\nworks' campaign. I think, that's<br />\nappropriate for us too\u2014wellaye the<br />\nbuildings that we need here pretty much<br />\nhere.<br />\nN-L: As far as new programs, Goucher<br />\nobviously committeed itself to being a<br />\nsingle sex college for the next ten years.<br />\nDo you see the question of Goucher<br />\ngoing coed or not as coming up again<br />\nsoon?<br />\nDorsey: It might I think you have to<br />\nhang easy about these things in higher<br />\neducation. Changes come very rapidly<br />\nand the pressure on isntitutions like<br />\nGoucher and institutions like Hopkins<br />\nfrom changes in outside society come<br />\nmuch more quickly than they did say a<br />\ngeneration ago.<br />\nNow I can't predict whether there<br />\nwould once again on this campus be an<br />\ninterest in coeducation. My hunch is that<br />\nthere won't be for some time if ever<br />\nagain. But I certainly wouldn't have seen<br />\nstranger things than that pop out of the<br />\nwoodwork, and I certainly wouldn't say<br />\nthat it wouldn't happen.<br />\nN-L: Do you personally support<br />\nsingle-sex education?<br />\nDorsey: I personally support single-sex<br />\neducation at Goucher and at other places.<br />\nN-L: What do you see as the basic<br />\nadvantage of having Goucher as a<br />\nsingle-sex institution as comparted to a<br />\ncoed institution\u2014the advantage if offers<br />\nthe students?<br />\nDorsey: I have the whole range of<br />\nthings and none of them are new.<br />\nAnybody who stands in my position<br />\npretty much stands for the same reason. I<br />\nam at heart a pluralist. That is, I think<br />\nthere should be lots of options open to<br />\nindividuals so that they can choose what<br />\nthey think what happens to them is best<br />\nfor them. If you want to go to plumbing<br />\nschool, then there should be a plumbing<br />\nschool to go to. Everybody shouldn't be<br />\nforced to go through the same kind of<br />\neducational system.<br />\nAs part of that whole pluralistic<br />\nspectrum, I am in favor of a single-sexed<br />\ncollege whether for men or women.<br />\nFor women the advantages of a single<br />\nsex college are that they are in the kinds<br />\nof situations where the kind of stereotype<br />\nroles that they're expected to play by<br />\nmen don't come into play. They live and<br />\nstudy in an institution which is designed<br />\nfor them, not for men, where their needs<br />\nare the primary determinatnts of that<br />\nhappens what programs take place and<br />\nwhere they run everything themselves.<br />\nThey're also in a situation where<br />\nnobody ever says to them you can't do<br />\nsomething because you're a woman and<br />\nthat's nonsense.. In fact, they're in a<br />\nsituation where everything says to them,<br />\nyou can do certain things because you are<br />\na woman and there are women to prove<br />\nit. As for instance, there's no point in<br />\nanybody saying here to a student you<br />\ncan't be a president of anything because<br />\nyou're a woman because there's the<br />\npresident of something, standing<br />\nwalkinging around in front of her.<br />\nNow these are for many women, not<br />\nall, these are very important conditions<br />\nfor learning and for growth. Now how<br />\nimportant they are shows in the kinds of<br />\nfigures recent research has revealed, when<br />\nlooking at the percentages of what could<br />\nbe called achieving women\u2014that's women<br />\nwho show up in \"Who's Who\" that come<br />\nout of women's colleges.<br />\nI think this. says something not only<br />\nabout the kind of education that they got<br />\n<br />\nRhoda Dorsey wields gag shirt<br />\nuntil I went out into your famous real<br />\nat those colleges because the kind of<br />\nworld. Then, by then it was too late and<br />\neducation in terms of content was pretty<br />\nthey said it to me just once and forgot it.<br />\nmuch what they would have gotten at a<br />\nN-L: How significant do you think it<br />\ncoed or male college. It says something<br />\nwas that a Goucher President was finally<br />\nabout the kind of confidence and self<br />\na woman with your appointment?<br />\nassurance that they got while they were<br />\nDorsey: Very, to give you a brief<br />\nthere so they were prepared to plow<br />\nanswer.<br />\nforward which is exactly what many of<br />\nN-L: Do most women's colleges have<br />\nthem did.<br />\nwomen<br />\npresidents?<br />\nan<br />\nit<br />\nin<br />\nfeel<br />\nthem<br />\nyou<br />\nputs<br />\nDo<br />\nN-L:<br />\nDorsey: You know, somebody asked<br />\nunrealistic situation with their haven<br />\nme that question yesterday and I'm<br />\nfrom the prejudices of the external world,<br />\nembarrassed to say that I don't know.<br />\nand then when they go ou might they be<br />\nThere was a great statement made by<br />\nan a disadvantage?<br />\nBonnie Sandler, who is the director of the<br />\nDorsey: I don't know. That's a kind of<br />\nWomen's Operation at the Association of<br />\ntraditional charge. I myself have never<br />\nAmerican Colleges and she made it two<br />\nregarded any instituion as much of a<br />\nyears ago and at that point there were<br />\nhaven from anything. Most institutions<br />\nfewer women college presidents of any<br />\nare their own world and they have their<br />\nkind of institution, male, female or for<br />\nown versions of all the joys and most of<br />\ndogs, than there were whooping cranes.<br />\nthe horrors of what you call the real<br />\nSince that time there have been more<br />\nworld. As a matter of fact, for most<br />\nwomen college presidents appointed.<br />\npeople the real world is somewhat of a<br />\nThere also have beena couple of what is<br />\nhaven from the kinds of pressure you can<br />\nto me very significant appointments, a<br />\nget from the insides of an instituion like<br />\ncouple of women appointed to head up as<br />\nGoucher or Hopkins. But I think that<br />\npresidents or of an equivalent term<br />\nthere's something to be said for that<br />\nsubunits of the University of California<br />\nperhaps; there's a great deal to be said<br />\nsystem.<br />\nhowever to be growing up.in a formative<br />\nperiod and that's what your late<br />\nSo I think that whatever the figures<br />\nadolescent years are. Where those<br />\nare, there is a trend now to at least<br />\nprejudices don't exist and where you're<br />\nrecognizing that it is possible to consider<br />\njust not going to recognize them.

Or, you can recognize them,<br />\nI hope not.

The proposed qualifications would limit the field<br />\nof eligibles to \"advanced and carefully selected\"<br />\nupperclassmen. Meanwhile, however, undergraduates at<br />\nDickinson College have used the Bologna center for the past<br />\nsix years running as a standard junior year abroad program<br />\nnot limited to either the \"carefully selected\" or the<br />\n\"advanced.\"<br />\n\u2022 It is the pinnacle of irony and absurdity that another<br />\ncollege could manage for so many years to make better use of<br />\na Hopkins facility than the Hopkins community could.<br />\nThough the proposed opening of the center to<br />\nundergraduates is a step in the right direction, its<br />\nrestrictiveness and elitism are testimony to the extent to<br />\nwhich the program will exist \"in nani.. only.\"<br />\nThough it might pain some egos to do so, the most<br />\nefficacious move would involve drawing the moral from the<br />\nexample of Dickinson College and allowing Hopkins<br />\nundergraduates that which has been afforded Dickinson<br />\nundergraduates for the past six years\u2014the opportunity to<br />\nbenefit from an excellent Hopkins facility.

It's this<br />\nplumber-like network that caused<br />\nme some chagrin when it indicated<br />\nthat Hopkins seemed to be<br />\npassively awaiting a $300 tuition<br />\nhike for next year. Maybe its just a<br />\ngeneral cynicism amongst all of<br />\nus...or perhaps the majority of<br />\nstudents simply feel that things are<br />\ntough all over, and after all, the<br />\nUniversity has to keep up<br />\nsomehow.<br />\nWhatever it is, the willingness<br />\namongst students to tacitly<br />\napprove another tuition hike,<br />\nmakes it difficult for me to<br />\noppose.

Yet I<br />\ndoubt that the first semester at any<br />\nother school is significantly<br />\ndifferent.lIt takes a while to accept<br />\nthe abberations from the college<br />\nmodel pasted on one's mind, a<br />\nwhile to accept Hopkins. Most<br />\npeople who speak of transferring<br />\nnever get around to doing it. Sonic<br />\nare too lazy, others not serious and<br />\nprobably a majoriy learn to like<br />\nschool. However, if you follow<br />\nthrough on the transfer<br />\napplications, try to visit the<br />\ncampus and find out all you can<br />\nabout the school. Transferring is<br />\nnot the same process as the original<br />\nselection of a college.

Her<br />\naccession came at a time of flux and<br />\nuncertainty for Goucher\u2014 the college had<br />\nrejected a merger offerfrom Hopkins, had<br />\nvowed to eschew coeducation for at least<br />\n10 years, and faced greater financial<br />\ndiflculties than ever.<br />\nNews-Letter: First of all, what do you<br />\nsee as your primary function<br />\nas President of Goucher College, a small<br />\nliberal arts College in a stage of<br />\ntransition?<br />\nRhoda Dorsey: Well, you know this<br />\ntransition point is an interesting one. I<br />\n.think the transition point was last year.<br />\nAs far as I'm concerned, the decisions<br />\nmade last year signaled certain kinds of<br />\ndirections in which the college will be<br />\npreceeding in the future, and its my job<br />\nto insure that those directions are<br />\nfollowed as rapidly and effectively for the<br />\nCollege as possible. In fact, what that<br />\nmeans, is that I do a whole mess of things<br />\nhaving to deal with keeping the enterprise<br />\nalive, just as your president does. That<br />\nmeans keeping a general weather eye on<br />\nall things that go on on campus. It means<br />\nbeing the contact person between the<br />\ncollege and are kinds of outside worlds.<br />\nAnd it means heading up attempts to get<br />\nfinancial support for the college. I think<br />\nthat those are the kind of major<br />\nresponsibilities that pretty much all<br />\nCollege Presidents have to deal with.<br />\nN-L: How important is getting<br />\nfinancial assistance for the College? How<br />\nmuch of your time does that occupy?<br />\nDorsey: I'm not really terribly good at<br />\ntelling you _what percentage of time. It's<br />\napt to seem to occupy more time than it<br />\ndoes, because alot of getting financial<br />\nsupport involves traveling to a point Iso it<br />\nmay take you a couple of days, where the<br />\nactual discussion with a donor, a<br />\npotential donor may only last for an<br />\nhour, a half an hour, so that its apt to<br />\nconsume blocks of time. which make it<br />\nappear to be the all-consuming mission in<br />\nlife. I don't really think this is the case,<br />\nbut it's obviously pretty important. Its<br />\nimportant to us because three years ago<br />\nwe started a capital campaign which was<br />\nto run in two phases. The first was to<br />\nconcentrate on the Baltimore area where<br />\nthe largest single percentage of Goucher<br />\nalumni lived! The second was to be a<br />\nnational campaign, focusing on all parents<br />\nand alumni across the country. Now the<br />\nfirst phase was about over when Mr. Perry<br />\n[Marvin Perry, Dorsey's predecessor as<br />\nPresident] resigned and last year while I<br />\nwas acting president there was a decision<br />\nthat the national phase would not be<br />\ncontinued. It was viewed as not a good<br />\nthing to go about nationally without a<br />\npermanent President. So that as soon as<br />\nmy presidency was announced,as last the<br />\nnational phase began. And in fact, that is<br />\nwhat we are embarked on now. And that<br />\nmeans in the course of this year in<br />\nconjunction with that cornpaign. I will be<br />\ngoing to various parts of the country<br />\nseeking support.<br />\nN-L: Do you have any goal in mind as<br />\nto how much you want to raise?<br />\nDorsey: Well, the goal that was<br />\noriginally set forth for the campaign was<br />\nS10 million. Not quite like the Hopkins<br />\nHundreds. Just as well when you're trying<br />\nto reach it.<br />\nN-L: What would be the main capital<br />\nimprovement? Any new buildings'?<br />\nDorsey: No. this is not a campaign that<br />\nwas designed for buildings at all. It was<br />\nfor money to go into such things as<br /><br />\nimproving faculty salaries, expanding the<br />\nfinancial support available to the college<br />\nfor students, giving support to new<br />\nprograms, to the library, and a lovely one<br />\nwhich is called contingency, the<br />\nPresident's purse-for nice lovely projects.<br />\nBut it's all a people's campaign, not a<br />\nworks' campaign. I think, that's<br />\nappropriate for us too\u2014wellaye the<br />\nbuildings that we need here pretty much<br />\nhere.<br />\nN-L: As far as new programs, Goucher<br />\nobviously committeed itself to being a<br />\nsingle sex college for the next ten years.<br />\nDo you see the question of Goucher<br />\ngoing coed or not as coming up again<br />\nsoon?<br />\nDorsey: It might I think you have to<br />\nhang easy about these things in higher<br />\neducation. Changes come very rapidly<br />\nand the pressure on isntitutions like<br />\nGoucher and institutions like Hopkins<br />\nfrom changes in outside society come<br />\nmuch more quickly than they did say a<br />\ngeneration ago.<br />\nNow I can't predict whether there<br />\nwould once again on this campus be an<br />\ninterest in coeducation. My hunch is that<br />\nthere won't be for some time if ever<br />\nagain. But I certainly wouldn't have seen<br />\nstranger things than that pop out of the<br />\nwoodwork, and I certainly wouldn't say<br />\nthat it wouldn't happen.<br />\nN-L: Do you personally support<br />\nsingle-sex education?<br />\nDorsey: I personally support single-sex<br />\neducation at Goucher and at other places.<br />\nN-L: What do you see as the basic<br />\nadvantage of having Goucher as a<br />\nsingle-sex institution as comparted to a<br />\ncoed institution\u2014the advantage if offers<br />\nthe students?<br />\nDorsey: I have the whole range of<br />\nthings and none of them are new.<br />\nAnybody who stands in my position<br />\npretty much stands for the same reason. I<br />\nam at heart a pluralist. That is, I think<br />\nthere should be lots of options open to<br />\nindividuals so that they can choose what<br />\nthey think what happens to them is best<br />\nfor them. If you want to go to plumbing<br />\nschool, then there should be a plumbing<br />\nschool to go to. Everybody shouldn't be<br />\nforced to go through the same kind of<br />\neducational system.<br />\nAs part of that whole pluralistic<br />\nspectrum, I am in favor of a single-sexed<br />\ncollege whether for men or women.<br />\nFor women the advantages of a single<br />\nsex college are that they are in the kinds<br />\nof situations where the kind of stereotype<br />\nroles that they're expected to play by<br />\nmen don't come into play. They live and<br />\nstudy in an institution which is designed<br />\nfor them, not for men, where their needs<br />\nare the primary determinatnts of that<br />\nhappens what programs take place and<br />\nwhere they run everything themselves.<br />\nThey're also in a situation where<br />\nnobody ever says to them you can't do<br />\nsomething because you're a woman and<br />\nthat's nonsense.. In fact, they're in a<br />\nsituation where everything says to them,<br />\nyou can do certain things because you are<br />\na woman and there are women to prove<br />\nit. As for instance, there's no point in<br />\nanybody saying here to a student you<br />\ncan't be a president of anything because<br />\nyou're a woman because there's the<br />\npresident of something, standing<br />\nwalkinging around in front of her.<br />\nNow these are for many women, not<br />\nall, these are very important conditions<br />\nfor learning and for growth. Now how<br />\nimportant they are shows in the kinds of<br />\nfigures recent research has revealed, when<br />\nlooking at the percentages of what could<br />\nbe called achieving women\u2014that's women<br />\nwho show up in \"Who's Who\" that come<br />\nout of women's colleges.<br />\nI think this. says something not only<br />\nabout the kind of education that they got<br /><br />\nRhoda Dorsey wields gag shirt<br />\nuntil I went out into your famous real<br />\nat those colleges because the kind of<br />\nworld. Then, by then it was too late and<br />\neducation in terms of content was pretty<br />\nthey said it to me just once and forgot it.<br />\nmuch what they would have gotten at a<br />\nN-L: How significant do you think it<br />\ncoed or male college. It says something<br />\nwas that a Goucher President was finally<br />\nabout the kind of confidence and self<br />\na woman with your appointment?<br />\nassurance that they got while they were<br />\nDorsey: Very, to give you a brief<br />\nthere so they were prepared to plow<br />\nanswer.<br />\nforward which is exactly what many of<br />\nN-L: Do most women's colleges have<br />\nthem did.<br />\nwomen<br />\npresidents?<br />\nan<br />\nit<br />\nin<br />\nfeel<br />\nthem<br />\nyou<br />\nputs<br />\nDo<br />\nN-L:<br />\nDorsey: You know, somebody asked<br />\nunrealistic situation with their haven<br />\nme that question yesterday and I'm<br />\nfrom the prejudices of the external world,<br />\nembarrassed to say that I don't know.<br />\nand then when they go ou might they be<br />\nThere was a great statement made by<br />\nan a disadvantage?<br />\nBonnie Sandler, who is the director of the<br />\nDorsey: I don't know.

I myself have never<br />\nAmerican Colleges and she made it two<br />\nregarded any instituion as much of a<br />\nyears ago and at that point there were<br />\nhaven from anything. Most institutions<br />\nfewer women college presidents of any<br />\nare their own world and they have their<br />\nkind of institution, male, female or for<br />\nown versions of all the joys and most of<br />\ndogs, than there were whooping cranes.<br />\nthe horrors of what you call the real<br />\nSince that time there have been more<br />\nworld. As a matter of fact, for most<br />\nwomen college presidents appointed.<br />\npeople the real world is somewhat of a<br />\nThere also have beena couple of what is<br />\nhaven from the kinds of pressure you can<br />\nto me very significant appointments, a<br />\nget from the insides of an instituion like<br />\ncouple of women appointed to head up as<br />\nGoucher or Hopkins. But I think that<br />\npresidents or of an equivalent term<br />\nthere's something to be said for that<br />\nsubunits of the University of California<br />\nperhaps; there's a great deal to be said<br />\nsystem.<br />\nhowever to be growing up.in a formative<br />\nperiod and that's what your late<br />\nSo I think that whatever the figures<br />\nadolescent years are.

The proposed qualifications would limit the field<br />\nof eligibles to \"advanced and carefully selected\"<br />\nupperclassmen. Meanwhile, however, undergraduates at<br />\nDickinson College have used the Bologna center for the past<br />\nsix years running as a standard junior year abroad program<br />\nnot limited to either the \"carefully selected\" or the<br />\n\"advanced.\"<br />\n\u2022 It is the pinnacle of irony and absurdity that another<br />\ncollege could manage for so many years to make better use of<br />\na Hopkins facility than the Hopkins community could.<br />\nThough the proposed opening of the center to<br />\nundergraduates is a step in the right direction, its<br />\nrestrictiveness and elitism are testimony to the extent to<br />\nwhich the program will exist \"in nani.. only.\"<br />\nThough it might pain some egos to do so, the most<br />\nefficacious move would involve drawing the moral from the<br />\nexample of Dickinson College and allowing Hopkins<br />\nundergraduates that which has been afforded Dickinson<br />\nundergraduates for the past six years\u2014the opportunity to<br />\nbenefit from an excellent Hopkins facility. It is a horrible<br />\nthought that University officials would allow the students of<br />\nanother institution to derive more benefit from a University<br />\nfacility than Hopkins students.<br />\n\u2022<br /><br />\nBy SHEP HOFFMAN<br />\nThe first responsibility of a<br />\nCADRE (a political leader in<br />\nChina) is not to loose touch with<br />\nthe people he is supposed to serve.<br />\nWell, I've lost touch for the most<br />\npart. What little information I get<br />\nabout Hopkins comes from the<br />\nN-L, the Gazette, Hopkins Mag.<br />\nand my closest friends. All in all a<br />\npretty warped perspective,<br />\nwouldn't you say? It's this<br />\nplumber-like network that caused<br />\nme some chagrin when it indicated<br />\nthat Hopkins seemed to be<br />\npassively awaiting a $300 tuition<br />\nhike for next year. Maybe its just a<br />\ngeneral cynicism amongst all of<br />\nus...or perhaps the majority of<br />\nstudents simply feel that things are<br />\ntough all over, and after all, the<br />\nUniversity has to keep up<br />\nsomehow.<br />\nWhatever it is, the willingness<br />\namongst students to tacitly<br />\napprove another tuition hike,<br />\nmakes it difficult for me to<br />\noppose. Now $300 may not seem<br />\nlike much to most of us, but there<br />\nare some students even at Hopkins<br />\nfor whom $300 will, be a<br />\nsignificant hump in expenses.<br />\nEveryone's tuition will go up $300.<br />\nSome students may get financial<br />\naid to cover the hike, others will<br />\nnot. Some students next fall may<br />\nbe faced with a $300 tuition hike<br />\nand a cut in financial aid...the<br />\npicture grows a little darker.
