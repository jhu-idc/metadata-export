Although the committee met only once every<br />\nother month, Rosen has been in constant contact with the ten committee members.<br />\nThe committee has encountered several problems. For example, last year's committee<br />\ndecided to write the book using a computer, which resulted in many of this year's committee<br />\nmembers being unfamiliar with the computer language that was chosen, forcing them to spend a<br />\ngreat deal of time learning it. Another problem is the task of raising funds for the book's publication; however, SC president Michael Steele is confident that the funds will be available.<br />\n<br />\nStudentServices--John Kelleher<br />\nAccording to SC president Steele, Student Services, the one committee that causes the<br />\nmost concern among students and puts the most pressure on the chairman, has done nothing so far<br />\nthis year. Committee chairman Kelleher, who recently resigned from this position, explained that<br />\nhe had problems organizing the committee and delegating authority. Kelleher's committee of ten<br />\nexpected to participate in solicitation of bids for a new book store and the establishment of a<br />\npeer counseling program.

Because it ultimately rests<br />\non pure human choice, what we call<br />\n-'values\", all objective huffing and puffing<br />\nseems a bit out of place. We would, then,<br />\nlike to make some subjective remarks:<br />\nChoice is the first issue. We have all<br />\nbeen bombarded with the \"it's your life<br />\nand your responsibility\" doctrine since<br />\nwe were toddlers. We hope it's not pure<br />\nabstraction. A woman's body is her own,<br />\nand hers solely.

Choices made under duress are<br />\nalways tough--and bringing in a myriad of<br />\nideologies isn't going to help. There might<br />\nbe more abortions if, for example, those<br />\nwho so vehemently opposed them had to<br />\nlive with the consequences of their actions-it's the woman who has the child.

EINOLF<br />\n\"The members of the Faculty Curriculum Review Committee acknowledge that the<br />\nJohns Hopkins University has an<br />\noutstanding undergraduate program in many areas, and that the<br />\nprogram as a whole offers many<br />\nopportunities to a student body<br />\nof general excellence.<br />\nThe<br />\n(FCRC) recognizes the obligation of the Faculty to provide<br />\nthe very best undergraduate<br />\neducation and its equally important roles in graduate education and in creative innovation.\" This is how the report<br />\nfrom the FCRC to Dean George<br />\nOwen begins, and the juicy parts<br />\nare yet to be discovered. The<br />\nopening passages seem to say,<br />\n\"We, the Faculty with George<br />\nConnolly and Bob Elkin, like the<br />\njob we're doing, so let's keep<br />\nright on paying more attention<br />\nto our research than to our<br />\nundergraduates.\"<br />\n<br />\nLast week, Steve Viggiani<br />\nopened your eyes to some of the<br />\nmeasures examined in the FCRC<br />\nreport, but he tactfully sidestepped at least two major issues<br />\nin our undergraduate education.<br />\nThe first dealt with in the FCRC<br />\nreport is the \"demise\" of \"nonspecialist courses suited to<br />\nbroadening and challenging experimental purpose,\" a lack of<br />\nwhich must be \"rectified if the<br />\nHopkins undergraduate is to<br />\nfully realize his or her full<br />\npotential both during and after<br />\nthe Hopkins tenure.\"<br />\nSimply put, this University<br />\ndoesn't really care about the<br />\nnovice. The Hopkins Humanities student who wishes to<br />\nbroaden his/her horizons is being<br />\nstifled by the respective departments. In fields such as Earth<br />\nand Planetary Sciences, Pat<br />\nShipman's Human Paleontology<br />\nand Owen Phillips' Alternative<br />\nEnergy Sources provide the right<br />\ncont. on p. 7<br />\n<br />\nalready been legalized--and you just can't<br />\ngo back. There is no evidence to suggest<br />\nthat a new wave of pious legislators will, by<br />\ntheir rhetoric, reduce the demand for<br />\nabortions. Currently, a woman can obtain<br />\na reasonably safe abortion. Taking away<br />\nthis opportunity will only bring back a very<br />\ngrim time.<br />\nFinally, the focus of the issue is all<br />\nwrong. We should all back up a step, and<br />\nconcentrate on educating women (and<br />\nmen) so the need for abortions will decline<br />\nto begin with. What is particularly alarming about the \"new morality\" is that<br />\nabortion is not the only victim of federal<br />\nbudget-cutting. Health and Human Services director Richard Schweicker recently<br />\nannounced his intentions to slash funding<br />\nfor both abortion and conception/contraception education programs. Unfortunately, one inevitably leads to the other. A<br />\nreduction in abortions--and that should be<br />\nthe end to strive for--comes only from<br />\nenlightenment about the real root of the<br />\nproblem.<br />\n<br />\nA New Canine View<br />\nTo the Editor:<br />\nPerhaps I am dragging up a<br />\ndead issue to beat it to death<br />\nonce more, but since my opinion<br />\ndiffers from 90% of the student<br />\nbody, I feel obligated to expose<br />\nmyself for abuse. About those<br />\ndogs:<br />\nI am part of the 10% who<br />\nrefused to sign petitions distributed among students protesting<br />\nthe administration's<br />\nmethod in the ban of dogs from<br />\nthe campus.<br />\nThe petition<br />\nseemed to accuse the administration of acting in a clandestine, underhanded<br />\nmanner<br />\nduring intersession when there<br />\nwould be little student response<br />\nand were unclear as to exactly<br />\nwhich portions of the ban were<br />\nunder protest.<br />\nIs it being<br />\nproposed that the student body<br />\nvote on every petty decision<br />\nchanging university policy? Be<br />\npractical!<br />\nI personally do not care if<br />\ndogs are or are not permitted on<br />\ncampus, but if they are, their<br />\nowners must be responsible for<br />\nthem. Dogs should not run<br />\nloose or be left tied to trees. It<br />\nis indicative of an irresponsible,<br />\ndog owner to leave one's dog<br />\nattended. Before I am accused of<br />\nhating dogs, etc. I shall make<br />\nthe point that I own a dog<br />\n<br />\nand take responsibility for her<br />\nactions. For this reason and the<br />\nactions of the irresponsible dog<br />\nowners on this campus, my dog<br />\nremains at my parents' home in<br />\nVirginia. Were she here, she(my<br />\ndog) would not be permitted on<br />\ncampus unattended. If I am in<br />\nclass, it is impossible for rrr to be<br />\naware of her actions for which I<br />\nam responsible.<br />\nAnyone who uses his dog<br />\nfor security purposes is undoubtedly cognizant of the<br />\nhazards of an inner-city campus.<br />\nIf one's dog is necessary to<br />\ninsure a safe walk to one's<br />\nresidence and he is left running<br />\nloose, how can one be certain he<br />\nwill be around to make the trip<br />\nhome and not splattered all over<br />\nCharles St.? Loose dogs belong<br />\non farms; dogs tied to trees<br />\nbelong in suburban neighborhoods with leash laws. Since<br />\nHopkins is neither, my dog will<br />\nnever come to Baltimore.<br />\nAnne McElwee<br />\n<br />\nDoughnuts and Bananas<br />\nTo the Editor:<br />\nLast year's controversy over<br />\nsexist fraternity posters \u2022 was<br />\nresolved in a meeting early<br />\nlast semester of myself, the<br />\npresident of the interfraternal<br />\ncouncil, representatives from the<br />\nGRO, and Chris Columbo<br />\nwhereupon the fraternity representative agreed to stop the<br />\npractice. Although I was pleased<br />\nto see that none of the posters<br />\nshowed nude women in degrading positions this year, the<br />\n(sic) were two that were definately (sic) sexist and offensive. One was the \"D.U.'s<br />\nBack\" poster. I don't believe<br />\nany of the members of that<br />\nfraternity have a back like the<br />\none displayed on the poster.<br />\nUsing naked women to advertise<br />\nan event is exactly that: using<br />\nwomen. The other, perhaps<br />\nmore \"subtle\" approach was the<br />\n<br />\nbanana chasing the doughnut.<br />\nI'm sure the men on campus<br />\nwould be offended if another<br />\ngroup put up posters of a<br />\ndoughnut with a knife in her<br />\nhand chasing a banana. I am not<br />\nobjecting to fraternities or their<br />\nparties, but since they are<br />\nHopkins' institutions I feel they<br />\nshould take more responsibility<br />\nand respect the feelings of other<br />\nstudents.<br />\nLaura Rosenthal<br />\nPresident of the Women's Center<br />\n<br />\nA Safer Charles St.<br />\nTo the Editor:<br />\nSince the administration<br />\nseems to be in an active mood,<br />\nthis may be a good moment to<br />\nraise the issue of the contraflow<br />\nlane in the central part of<br />\nCharles Street. I appreciate that<br />\nit is not easy to get traffic<br />\nengineers to alter layouts, even if<br />\nthe layout is evidently unsafe<br />\nand the cause of serious accidents, because of their tendency to give absolute priority<br />\nto traffic flow considerations.<br />\nHowever, an indirect approach<br />\nto the problem, which did not<br />\ninvolve loss of face, loss of real<br />\nor imaginary traffic capacity,<br />\netc. might be worth trying.<br />\nWhat I have in mind is the<br />\ninstallation of rumble strips at<br />\nintervals along the south bound<br />\nlane. Rumble strips are corrugated sections of concrete<br />\nwhich make cars \"rumble\" when<br />\nthey pass over them, and are<br />\nusually used to slow down<br />\ntraffic and warn it of an approaching hazard. Several have<br />\nrecently been installed on the<br />\nramp from 1-95 down to Russell<br />\nStreet. On Charles Street, the<br />\n\"rumble\" should be audible<br />\nbelow general traffic noise and<br />\nwould alert people crossing the<br />\nstreet to the approach of vehicles on the southbound lane,<br />\nin addition to fulfilling its usual<br />\ncont. on p. 5<br />\n<br />\n\fNEWS-LETTER / PAGE 5<br />\n<br />\nReaders Take Exception To Mareck Editorial<br />\nfalsely interpreted.

Dept.'s<br />\ncourse listings, it sounds like<br />\na truly interesting course. Its<br />\nJohn<br />\ninstructor,<br />\nsupposed<br />\nGryder, has disappeared in a<br />\ncloud of smoke to the administration, emerging periodically<br />\nto torture the incoming frosh.<br />\nIn Philip Hartman's (the<br />\nchairman of the FCRC) Biology<br />\nDepartment, supposedly one of<br />\nthe finest in the country, the<br />\nnon-biologist is ignored and<br />\nwith<br />\ncompete<br />\nto<br />\nforced<br />\nscreaming premeds in Evo Bio if<br />\nhe or she wants to get a taste of<br />\nBiology.<br />\nThe FCRC advocates the<br />\nCore Curriculum as a solution to<br />\nthis problem, but insists that it<br />\nshould be solved by the individual departments--a classic case<br />\nof \"Doctor, heal thyself.\"<br />\nA point the FCRC does not<br />\ndeal with is the obvious discrepancies between the Johns Hopkins University Circular, with its<br />\nsexist- picture of a studying<br />\nblonde on the cover, and the<br />\nactual course offerings each<br />\nsemester. Easily the first example is the Dept. of Anthropology, which advertises thirtysix courses, but teaches only 14<br />\nof the listed courses (39%). In<br />\nthe last three years, the department has also taught eight<br />\ncourses which have never appeared in the Circular.<br />\nAll<br />\nfigures cited herein have been<br />\ntaken from an examination of<br />\nthe Schedule of Courses and do<br />\nnot apply to course offerings<br />\ncancelled due to lack of enrollment.<br />\nAs the Biology and Chemistry departments offer almost<br />\nall of their listed courses, the<br />\nproblem does not lie with the<br />\nand<br />\nNatural<br />\nQuantitative<br />\nSciences.<br />\nStudents with an<br />\ninterest in the Humanities are<br />\nled to attend Hopkins by a<br />\nsubtle breed of false advertising<br />\nbeing perpetrated and perpetuated by the Departments<br />\nthemselves. While complicity<br />\nfrom above can not be ruled<br />\nout, the University did indeed<br />\nrequest changes from the chairmen of all departments, prior to<br />\nthe publication of the Circular.<br />\nIn many cases, these poor, tired,<br />\noverworked people (sarcasm<br />\nthere, folks) just send in the<br />\nsame description as they have<br />\nfor the last twenty years,<br />\nknowing full well that courses<br />\ntitled \"Current Politics: The<br />\nBombing of Cambodia\" are just<br />\na little outdated.<br />\nThe problem inherent in the<br />\nCircular is that the lead time-that is, the amount of time<br />\nneeded to prepare for publication--of this massive volume is<br />\nat least six months, if not more.<br />\nIn six months, the University<br />\nexperiences a turnover of professors, courses, and the like,<br />\nrendering the Circular obsolete<br />\n<br />\nwhen it hits the streets. In order<br />\nto solve this many universities<br />\nhave created two separate sets of<br />\npublications:<br />\none, sent to<br />\nprospective frosh, is a meld<br />\nbetween first 57 pages of the<br />\nCircular, plus the \"blurbs\" from<br />\neach department, outlining rules<br />\nand degree requirements, and<br />\nthe Univeisity Manual (READ<br />\nREAD READ). The second<br />\npart, given to students every<br />\nyear, as well as PF's, is a listing<br />\nof all the courses, and descriptions, bound in somewhat less<br />\ngrand style and more up-to-date.<br />\nThis solution is more convenient for both incoming and<br />\npresent students, because such a<br />\nvolume is both easier to handle<br />\nand more concise than today's<br />\n<br />\nCircular.<br />\nMr. Viggiani discusses the<br />\nsection of the FCRC report on<br />\ncourse credits and hours, which<br />\nis by far the most entertaining<br />\nsection. If the proposed cuts in<br />\ncredits were to be instituted,<br />\nthose majoring in Classics,<br />\nHistory, History of Art, Humanities, Mathematics, Political<br />\nEconomy, Political Science,<br />\nPsychology, and Writing Seminars would all be attending the<br />\nUniversity for five years. At six<br />\nthou a crack, I can see the<br />\nadministration slavering over<br />\nthat right now. The FCRC<br />\nappendix is so ludicrous, I find it<br />\nhard to believe that any serious<br />\nprofessor who had actually been<br />\na college student, even con-<br />\n<br />\nsidered it. \"Intro. Sociology--2<br />\ncredits,<br />\nGeneral<br />\nPhysics--3<br />\ncredits, etc.\" it reads, ad infinitum.<br />\nThe FCRC did not advocate<br />\nplus-minus grading saying (pg.<br />\n3), \"(12) The current system of<br />\ngrading (A,B,C,D,F) should be<br />\ncontinued for those courses in<br />\nwhich letter grades are given.\"<br />\nSuch a policy is in direct<br />\nopposition to the policies of<br />\nthose universities in which Hopkins is in direct competition<br />\nwith for students. Perhaps a<br />\nsecond review of this topic is<br />\nnecessary.<br />\nA final point, which must, I<br />\nthink, be made, is Hopkins' lack<br />\nof a mandatory Freshman Composition course.<br />\nThose who<br />\n<br />\nbelieve<br />\nthat<br />\nContemporary<br />\nAmerican Letters will teach you<br />\nhow to structure a proper<br />\nresearch paper or thesis are living<br />\nin the Middle Ages. Mandatory<br />\nFreshman Comp. is the only way<br />\nto go, and the University should<br />\nexamine those policies.<br />\nThe students of Johns Hopkins have shown their opinions<br />\nabout an issue which was forced<br />\non them (campus canines), and<br />\nwhich to a large measure did not<br />\nconcern them, yet here we sit,<br />\nfat, dumb, and relatively happy,<br />\nwhile important policy decisions<br />\nin conduct, education, and<br />\nothers are passed, examined, and<br />\nhanded down as law behind our<br />\nbacks.

The Association will present a draft of a<br />\nconstitution to its members, and<br />\nthen also discuss the Mareck case<br />\nand the employee grievance<br />\nprocedure.<br />\nAt present, the object of the<br />\nmost discussion, other than the<br />\nMareck case itself, is the employee grievance procedure. A<br />\npersonnel<br />\noffice guidebook<br />\nstates that \"any staff member<br />\nhas the right to present to th\u2018..<br />\nUniversity any personal concern<br />\nor dissatisfaction regarding his or<br />\nher employment, and have it<br />\nconsidered on its merits.\"<br />\nHowever, there are only<br />\nvery broad procedural guidelines<br />\nafter that. An employee must<br />\nidentify, in a written letter to his<br />\nimmediate supervisor, a specific<br />\ncomplaint. The supervisor responds in writing, sending a<br />\ncopy of his response to the<br />\nPersonnel Office. If the employee is dissatisfied with the<br />\nresponse, he can request a<br />\nwritten response from \"the<br />\nDepartment Head or his Designee,\" who must first discuss<br />\nthe response with the Personnel<br />\n<br />\nOffice. After that the Personnel<br />\nOffice guidebook states,\"This is<br />\nthe last step in the grievance<br />\nprocedure.\"<br />\nNeil Smith of the Mareck<br />\nSupport Committee attacks the<br />\nprocedure for its lack of specifies and bi-partisanship.<br />\n\"It's not a fair grievance<br />\nprocedure if the boss and the<br />\njudge are meeting together with-<br />\n<br />\nout the employee,\" he said. He<br />\nadded that he \"knew for a fact<br />\nthat (Director of Personnel<br />\nLyon) Rogers had agreed with<br />\nGalambos that he would back<br />\nhim up on firing Marge before<br />\nthe thing actually happened,\"<br />\nalthough he declined to say how<br />\nhe knew this.

The dimensions of the inside of the tree<br />\nare twice those of the outside. You gaze down in<br />\nwonder at the nymph colony--an autonomous collective.<br />\nYou overhear some nymphs conversing. It is prophesied<br />\nby the oracle that a noseless man will come to be made<br />\ntheir god of the Phallus, and that a fair maiden, wearing<br />\na golden helmet on her head, will come to be their<br />\nQueen and lead them in battle against the dwarves.<br />\n1. If you are the noseless Chastity alone, the nymphs<br />\ncut off your right buttock as an initiation and replace it<br />\nwith a wicker frame.

If you are Chastity with a chamberpot on your<br />\nhead, you become Queen of the nymphs. If you arrive<br />\nalone, you are seduced by this newly found power and<br />\nbuild the nymphs into an advanced military-industrial<br />\nnation.<br />\n4. If Chastity with the chamberpot on her head is<br />\njoined by a Warlord Cadwell, they lead their respective<br />\nnations in war against each other. During the battle the<br />\ntwo lovers recognize each other and fall in love all over<br />\nagain. Their respective peoples take their leaders' examples, and in the end it is dwarves and nymphs forever.<br />\n5.

If you arrive as Chastity with a noseless man that is<br />\nnot Cadwell, the man is made the phallic god and--if.<br />\nCadwell doesn't come to your rescue as either the<br />\nWarlord or noseless and seeking the pot--the noseless<br />\nstranger makes you the first sacrifice to the god. However you do not die but become a pair of discarded shoes<br />\nthat forever searches the world for its feet.<br />\n7. If you are there as Cadwell the Warlord, you<br />\nchallenge the noseless imposter to a joust. Though<br />\nyou win the nymphs force you to repent for killing their<br />\nphallic god by cutting off your nose.<br />\n8. If Cadwell arrives noseless, seeking the pot, he<br />\nanswers the noseless imposter's challenge to a joust.<br />\nThis causes civil war among the nymphs, many of whom<br />\ngo mad at seeing two phallic gods at the same time.

After first listening<br />\nto his new album, it is hard to tell if the<br />\nprimal fury of his previous albums is still<br />\nthere; upon closer inspection, though,<br />\none can see that the same angry imp of<br />\nthe perverse is there, but in a slightly<br />\ndifferent Oise.<br />\nCostello has undergone quite a<br />\nfew changes during the period between<br />\nthe explosive My Aim Is True, the biting<br />\n<br />\nA good clue to the nature of the<br />\nnew Elvis Costello can be found in the<br />\nmusical nature of Trust. All songs on the<br />\nalbum show a musical finesse and expertise which was not as apparent in previous<br />\nalbums, and more attention has been paid<br />\nto the technical aspects. Gone is most of<br />\nthe R&B raggedness of previous efforts;<br />\nTrust still has the vitality and power of<br />\nthe rhythm and blues sound, but with a<br />\ndash more musical skill. Elvis seems to be<br />\nplaying his lead guitar, previously a weak<br />\npoint, with a bit more care, and his vocals<br />\n<br />\nThis Year's Model, the virtuoso Armed<br />\nForces, the experimental Get Happy!!,<br />\nand Trust, a polished, precision-played<br />\nwork. An underlying chord throughout<br />\nhis previous albums has been his characteristic outrage against the modern<br />\nworld, which he allows to erupt in such<br />\nvolcanic songs as \"Pump It Up,\" \"Less<br />\nThan Zero,\" \"No Action,\" \"Goon<br />\nSquad,\" and \"Five Gears In Reverse.\"<br />\nThis musical vulcanism is not as apparent<br />\non Trust, so one naturally wonders if he<br />\nhas, as many critics have claimed, become<br />\na mellow Costello.<br />\n<br />\nhave become infinitely more intelligible.<br />\nThe mixing is more meticulous: the<br />\nbalancing of the instruments and the<br />\nfades are accomplished with a greater<br />\nartfulness and skill than before.<br />\nThe ambiguous musical identity<br />\nof the group termed the \"sound\" has also<br />\nchanged. Half of Steve Naive's parts are<br />\nplayed on the piano rather than the<br />\nkeyboard, for example.<br />\nTrust is as<br />\nreplete with stylistic experimentation as<br />\nwas Get Happy!!; on \"From a Whisper to<br />\na Scream,\" Costello shares his vocals with<br />\nsomeone else (namely, Glenn Tilbrook),<br />\n<br />\nBY TOM GRANT<br />\n<br />\nand the only instrument played on \"Shot<br />\nWith His Own Gun\" is a melodramatic<br />\npiano reminiscent of silent movie music.<br />\nThe keynotes of the album are finesse<br />\nand innovation--having wielded a battle-axe for four albums, Costello is now<br />\ntaking up the rapier.<br />\nThe anger of Elvis Costello is<br />\nsplattered all through Trust, but he has<br />\nlearned to channel his rage rather than<br />\nmerely allowing it to explode. \"Strict<br />\nTime,\" probably the best song of the<br />\nalbum, is a frustrated outcry against the ferent Fingers\" is a melancholy song on<br />\nsexual repressiveness of our society. the order of \"Just a Memory,\" but with a<br />\n\"Lovers Walk\" is a polemic against the morose country sound.<br />\ninsensitive, unthinking actions of people<br />\nAll aspects of the album taken<br />\nwho claim to be in love.

A ragged rustic, oar in<br />\nhand, slips carefully into the shadows,<br />\navoiding the traveler's searching eyes.<br />\nThe man is Sir Thomas More, and being<br />\nseen with him is considered an insult to<br />\nthe King, Henry VIII. The play is A Man<br />\nFor All Seasons (Center Stage, now<br />\nthrough March 8).<br />\nLady Margaret, (Sir Thomas<br />\nMore's daughter) curtseys before the<br />\nKing. \"Blow!\" he commands, withdrawing a pipe from his robes. She<br />\nblows, signalling the minstrels to begin a<br />\nsong. Then the business begins. The<br />\nKing begs Sir Thomas More, noted<br />\nintellectual and Chancellor of England, to<br />\nreconsider. The King's wife is barren, and<br />\nhe wants a divorce, but the laws of the<br />\nCatholic Church and the State forbid it.<br />\nThe Pope has been ignored, the Catholic<br />\nChurch replaced by the Church of England, and the Parliament has voted the<br />\ndivorce legal, all to give King Henry<br />\nan heir. But More has refused to either<br />\ncondone or condemn the divorce, and his<br />\nsilence is far louder than the pleas of<br />\nParliament.<br />\nSecretary Cromwell sips mead in a<br />\ncandle-lit tavern, devising with his cronies<br />\nlegal threats which could intimidate Sir<br />\nThomas into supporting the marriage.<br />\nLater, echoes in a stone tower whisper,<br />\n\"Treason.\"<br />\nMore, who believes that no man is<br />\nabove the law, yet refuses to betray the<br />\n<br />\nKing either, decides to abstain from<br />\ncommenting on the divorce. He resigns<br />\nhis post as Chancellor in the hope of<br />\nvanishing from the public eye, but this<br />\nact merely makes him more famous. The<br />\nKing's reputation is being tainted by<br />\nMore's actions, so pressure from Henry<br />\nsteadily grows stronger. More declares<br />\nagain and again that the law must be the ,<br />\ncauseway by which any citizen can walk<br />\nsafely through life, and thus, as he is in<br />\nno way bound by the law to condone the<br />\nKing's divorce, he has no need to fear.<br />\n<br />\nWhen the King demands that More<br />\nsupport his divorce, and More .refuses,<br />\nthere are accusations of treason. More<br />\nproclaims that when a man's actions are<br />\nforcibly separated from the dictates of his<br />\nconscience by the law itself, society has<br />\ncome to advocate lying and trickery and<br />\npunish honesty. More's conscience is<br />\napparently established by \"God's law,\"<br />\nand therefore human law should, in<br />\nMore's mind, reflect divine will.<br />\n<br />\nAs a contrast to More, the narrator, called \"The Common Man,\" makes<br />\nthe most of his position as Sir Thomas'<br />\nservant.

Each is a man in his middle<br />\nthirties involved in a relationship with a<br />\nmuch younger girl. Both men are self-indulgent and display impersonal attitudes toward their respective partners,<br />\nalike even in their disdain for their<br />\npartners' musical tastes: in \"Babylon<br />\nSisters\" the girl is told to \"turn that<br />\njungle music down,\" while in \"He)<br />\nNineteen\" she is chided for not knowing<br />\nwho Aretha Franklin is. Each man<br />\nattempts to bridge the generation gap by<br />\nmeans of enticement: \"We'll jog with the<br />\nshow-folk on the sand,\" he tells her in<br />\n\"Babylon Sisters\"; in \"Hey Nineteen\" the<br />\ngirl is promised an evening of Cuervo<br />\nGold and \"fine Colombian.\" But ironically, each man is looking for confirmation and appreciation, as stated in the<br />\nrefrains of the songs: as \"Tell me I'm the<br />\nonly one\" is repeated in \"Babylon<br />\nSisters,\" so also is \"Please take me along<br />\nwhen you slide down\" in \"Hey Nineteen.\" Interestingly but perhaps not<br />\nsurprisingly, neither girl responds during<br />\nthe course of each song. It is as if the<br />\nmen are talking to themselves.<br />\n<br />\nThe plot line is similar in<br />\n\"Gaucho\" except that it seems to include<br />\nhomosexual undertones. In this song, the<br />\nrelationship has gone sour, and the<br />\nprotagonist has become more assertive.<br />\nHe takes his friend's infatuation with a<br />\nstudded-leather cowboy to be just \"one<br />\nmore expensive kiss-off\" and challenges<br />\nhim with the question \"Who do you<br />\nthink I am?\" This is a question that<br />\nmany of the characters on the album<br />\ncould very well be asking themselves.<br />\nAgain, naturally, there is no response<br />\nfrom the second party.<br />\nThe album's final cut is the moody,<br />\n<br />\nrumbling \"Third World Man,\" and it is<br />\nthe only song in which third-person<br />\nnarrative is employed.

SC president Michael Steele plans to announce<br />\na replacement next week.<br />\nDuring the fall semester the committee very rarely met as a whole. Manlove divided the<br />\ncommittee's work into three subcommittees: advising, intersession, and foreign language requirement. Manlove explained that the committee was also working on an education survey of Hopkins undergraduates.<br />\nSteele expressed disappointment with the committee's performance, noting that it failed to<br />\nsubmit its required mid-year report. He added that many contmittee members had complained<br />\nto him about the infrequency of meetings and several members were unaware of their chairperson's identity. \"As far as 1 know,\" said Steele, \"they have accomplished nothing.\"<br /><br />\nFinancialAid--Larry Wolfe<br />\nDue to the reshuffling of the Financial Aid Office, the Financial Aid Committee has been<br />\nunable to du much work. A good deal of the first semester has been spent organizing and getting<br />\nfamiliar with the Financial Aid Office. The committee, which met weekly, also made plans for<br />\nthe possible publication of a newsletter and the distribution of a pamphlet that would notify<br />\nstudents of the many changes that have occurred concerning Financial Aid.<br /><br />\nLegalRights--Amir Halevy<br />\nSince the beginning of last summer, Chairman Halevy and his committee, composed of<br />\nseventeen members, have been working on the Judicial Code. Committee meetings were held<br />\nevery week, with the group and the administration constantly discussing the document. In addition to drafting the code, the committee worked to win its approval by the Student Council. The<br />\ncommittee, which will continue to meet weekly, also expects to distribute information about<br />\nstudent-tenant relationships.<br /><br />\nHousing--PaulRosen<br />\nDuring the fall semester, the Housing Committee has worked on the publication of a book<br />\nthat will give advice on how to live in Baltimore. Although the committee met only once every<br />\nother month, Rosen has been in constant contact with the ten committee members.<br />\nThe committee has encountered several problems. For example, last year's committee<br />\ndecided to write the book using a computer, which resulted in many of this year's committee<br />\nmembers being unfamiliar with the computer language that was chosen, forcing them to spend a<br />\ngreat deal of time learning it. Another problem is the task of raising funds for the book's publication; however, SC president Michael Steele is confident that the funds will be available.<br /><br />\nStudentServices--John Kelleher<br />\nAccording to SC president Steele, Student Services, the one committee that causes the<br />\nmost concern among students and puts the most pressure on the chairman, has done nothing so far<br />\nthis year. Committee chairman Kelleher, who recently resigned from this position, explained that<br />\nhe had problems organizing the committee and delegating authority. Kelleher's committee of ten<br />\nexpected to participate in solicitation of bids for a new book store and the establishment of a<br />\npeer counseling program. However, these issues were dealt with by Kelleher alone. The newly<br />\nappointed chairman of the committee is freshman Colin Flynn.<br /><br />\nLeake Offers Courses<br />\nTo Homewood Artists<br />\nStudents at Hopkins are not<br />\nused to taking a class purely for<br />\nenjoyment, not worrying about<br />\nmidterms and grades.

Because it ultimately rests<br />\non pure human choice, what we call<br />\n-'values\", all objective huffing and puffing<br />\nseems a bit out of place. We would, then,<br />\nlike to make some subjective remarks:<br />\nChoice is the first issue. We have all<br />\nbeen bombarded with the \"it's your life<br />\nand your responsibility\" doctrine since<br />\nwe were toddlers. We hope it's not pure<br />\nabstraction. A woman's body is her own,<br />\nand hers solely. Her decisions about<br />\nwhat to do with it rest with her alone.<br />\nUnderstanding, or dealing with pregnant<br />\nand often scared wome-n, is another nonabstraction. Choices made under duress are<br />\nalways tough--and bringing in a myriad of<br />\nideologies isn't going to help. There might<br />\nbe more abortions if, for example, those<br />\nwho so vehemently opposed them had to<br />\nlive with the consequences of their actions-it's the woman who has the child.

EINOLF<br />\n\"The members of the Faculty Curriculum Review Committee acknowledge that the<br />\nJohns Hopkins University has an<br />\noutstanding undergraduate program in many areas, and that the<br />\nprogram as a whole offers many<br />\nopportunities to a student body<br />\nof general excellence.<br />\nThe<br />\n(FCRC) recognizes the obligation of the Faculty to provide<br />\nthe very best undergraduate<br />\neducation and its equally important roles in graduate education and in creative innovation.\" This is how the report<br />\nfrom the FCRC to Dean George<br />\nOwen begins, and the juicy parts<br />\nare yet to be discovered. The<br />\nopening passages seem to say,<br />\n\"We, the Faculty with George<br />\nConnolly and Bob Elkin, like the<br />\njob we're doing, so let's keep<br />\nright on paying more attention<br />\nto our research than to our<br />\nundergraduates.\"<br /><br />\nLast week, Steve Viggiani<br />\nopened your eyes to some of the<br />\nmeasures examined in the FCRC<br />\nreport, but he tactfully sidestepped at least two major issues<br />\nin our undergraduate education.<br />\nThe first dealt with in the FCRC<br />\nreport is the \"demise\" of \"nonspecialist courses suited to<br />\nbroadening and challenging experimental purpose,\" a lack of<br />\nwhich must be \"rectified if the<br />\nHopkins undergraduate is to<br />\nfully realize his or her full<br />\npotential both during and after<br />\nthe Hopkins tenure.\"<br />\nSimply put, this University<br />\ndoesn't really care about the<br />\nnovice. The Hopkins Humanities student who wishes to<br />\nbroaden his/her horizons is being<br />\nstifled by the respective departments. In fields such as Earth<br />\nand Planetary Sciences, Pat<br />\nShipman's Human Paleontology<br />\nand Owen Phillips' Alternative<br />\nEnergy Sources provide the right<br />\ncont. on p. 7<br /><br />\nalready been legalized--and you just can't<br />\ngo back. There is no evidence to suggest<br />\nthat a new wave of pious legislators will, by<br />\ntheir rhetoric, reduce the demand for<br />\nabortions. Currently, a woman can obtain<br />\na reasonably safe abortion. Taking away<br />\nthis opportunity will only bring back a very<br />\ngrim time.<br />\nFinally, the focus of the issue is all<br />\nwrong. We should all back up a step, and<br />\nconcentrate on educating women (and<br />\nmen) so the need for abortions will decline<br />\nto begin with. What is particularly alarming about the \"new morality\" is that<br />\nabortion is not the only victim of federal<br />\nbudget-cutting. Health and Human Services director Richard Schweicker recently<br />\nannounced his intentions to slash funding<br />\nfor both abortion and conception/contraception education programs. Unfortunately, one inevitably leads to the other. A<br />\nreduction in abortions--and that should be<br />\nthe end to strive for--comes only from<br />\nenlightenment about the real root of the<br />\nproblem.<br /><br />\nA New Canine View<br />\nTo the Editor:<br />\nPerhaps I am dragging up a<br />\ndead issue to beat it to death<br />\nonce more, but since my opinion<br />\ndiffers from 90% of the student<br />\nbody, I feel obligated to expose<br />\nmyself for abuse. About those<br />\ndogs:<br />\nI am part of the 10% who<br />\nrefused to sign petitions distributed among students protesting<br />\nthe administration's<br />\nmethod in the ban of dogs from<br />\nthe campus.<br />\nThe petition<br />\nseemed to accuse the administration of acting in a clandestine, underhanded<br />\nmanner<br />\nduring intersession when there<br />\nwould be little student response<br />\nand were unclear as to exactly<br />\nwhich portions of the ban were<br />\nunder protest.<br />\nIs it being<br />\nproposed that the student body<br />\nvote on every petty decision<br />\nchanging university policy? Be<br />\npractical!<br />\nI personally do not care if<br />\ndogs are or are not permitted on<br />\ncampus, but if they are, their<br />\nowners must be responsible for<br />\nthem. Dogs should not run<br />\nloose or be left tied to trees. It<br />\nis indicative of an irresponsible,<br />\ndog owner to leave one's dog<br />\nattended. Before I am accused of<br />\nhating dogs, etc. I shall make<br />\nthe point that I own a dog<br /><br />\nand take responsibility for her<br />\nactions. For this reason and the<br />\nactions of the irresponsible dog<br />\nowners on this campus, my dog<br />\nremains at my parents' home in<br />\nVirginia. Were she here, she(my<br />\ndog) would not be permitted on<br />\ncampus unattended. If I am in<br />\nclass, it is impossible for rrr to be<br />\naware of her actions for which I<br />\nam responsible.<br />\nAnyone who uses his dog<br />\nfor security purposes is undoubtedly cognizant of the<br />\nhazards of an inner-city campus.<br />\nIf one's dog is necessary to<br />\ninsure a safe walk to one's<br />\nresidence and he is left running<br />\nloose, how can one be certain he<br />\nwill be around to make the trip<br />\nhome and not splattered all over<br />\nCharles St.? Loose dogs belong<br />\non farms; dogs tied to trees<br />\nbelong in suburban neighborhoods with leash laws. Since<br />\nHopkins is neither, my dog will<br />\nnever come to Baltimore.<br />\nAnne McElwee<br /><br />\nDoughnuts and Bananas<br />\nTo the Editor:<br />\nLast year's controversy over<br />\nsexist fraternity posters \u2022 was<br />\nresolved in a meeting early<br />\nlast semester of myself, the<br />\npresident of the interfraternal<br />\ncouncil, representatives from the<br />\nGRO, and Chris Columbo<br />\nwhereupon the fraternity representative agreed to stop the<br />\npractice. Although I was pleased<br />\nto see that none of the posters<br />\nshowed nude women in degrading positions this year, the<br />\n(sic) were two that were definately (sic) sexist and offensive. One was the \"D.U.'s<br />\nBack\" poster. I don't believe<br />\nany of the members of that<br />\nfraternity have a back like the<br />\none displayed on the poster.<br />\nUsing naked women to advertise<br />\nan event is exactly that: using<br />\nwomen. The other, perhaps<br />\nmore \"subtle\" approach was the<br /><br />\nbanana chasing the doughnut.<br />\nI'm sure the men on campus<br />\nwould be offended if another<br />\ngroup put up posters of a<br />\ndoughnut with a knife in her<br />\nhand chasing a banana. I am not<br />\nobjecting to fraternities or their<br />\nparties, but since they are<br />\nHopkins' institutions I feel they<br />\nshould take more responsibility<br />\nand respect the feelings of other<br />\nstudents.<br />\nLaura Rosenthal<br />\nPresident of the Women's Center<br /><br />\nA Safer Charles St.<br />\nTo the Editor:<br />\nSince the administration<br />\nseems to be in an active mood,<br />\nthis may be a good moment to<br />\nraise the issue of the contraflow<br />\nlane in the central part of<br />\nCharles Street. I appreciate that<br />\nit is not easy to get traffic<br />\nengineers to alter layouts, even if<br />\nthe layout is evidently unsafe<br />\nand the cause of serious accidents, because of their tendency to give absolute priority<br />\nto traffic flow considerations.<br />\nHowever, an indirect approach<br />\nto the problem, which did not<br />\ninvolve loss of face, loss of real<br />\nor imaginary traffic capacity,<br />\netc. might be worth trying.<br />\nWhat I have in mind is the<br />\ninstallation of rumble strips at<br />\nintervals along the south bound<br />\nlane. Rumble strips are corrugated sections of concrete<br />\nwhich make cars \"rumble\" when<br />\nthey pass over them, and are<br />\nusually used to slow down<br />\ntraffic and warn it of an approaching hazard. Several have<br />\nrecently been installed on the<br />\nramp from 1-95 down to Russell<br />\nStreet. On Charles Street, the<br />\n\"rumble\" should be audible<br />\nbelow general traffic noise and<br />\nwould alert people crossing the<br />\nstreet to the approach of vehicles on the southbound lane,<br />\nin addition to fulfilling its usual<br />\ncont. on p. 5<br /><br />\nNEWS-LETTER / PAGE 5<br /><br />\nReaders Take Exception To Mareck Editorial<br />\nfalsely interpreted.

Ladders and ropes<br />\nlead up to many holes in the tree trunk. Naked and<br />\nnubile nymphs are flying in and out of the tree. You<br />\nclimb inside. The dimensions of the inside of the tree<br />\nare twice those of the outside. You gaze down in<br />\nwonder at the nymph colony--an autonomous collective.<br />\nYou overhear some nymphs conversing. It is prophesied<br />\nby the oracle that a noseless man will come to be made<br />\ntheir god of the Phallus, and that a fair maiden, wearing<br />\na golden helmet on her head, will come to be their<br />\nQueen and lead them in battle against the dwarves.<br />\n1. If you are the noseless Chastity alone, the nymphs<br />\ncut off your right buttock as an initiation and replace it<br />\nwith a wicker frame. You are happy here because you<br />\nfeel for the first time that you belong.<br />\n2. If noseless Chastity meets Cadwell as the dwarf<br />\nWarlord, the dwarves attack and Chastity is trampledb<br />\ntheir Shetland cavalry when her lover fails to recogn4<br />\nher. Cadwell becomes king of-the combined populations<br />\nand reigns, not knowing that his love is dead,and always<br />\nhoping that she will stumble upon their secluded settlement.<br />\n3. If you are Chastity with a chamberpot on your<br />\nhead, you become Queen of the nymphs. If you arrive<br />\nalone, you are seduced by this newly found power and<br />\nbuild the nymphs into an advanced military-industrial<br />\nnation.<br />\n4. If Chastity with the chamberpot on her head is<br />\njoined by a Warlord Cadwell, they lead their respective<br />\nnations in war against each other. During the battle the<br />\ntwo lovers recognize each other and fall in love all over<br />\nagain. Their respective peoples take their leaders' examples, and in the end it is dwarves and nymphs forever.<br />\n5. If Chastity with the chamberpot on her head is<br />\njoined by a noseless Cadwell, seeking the pot, Cadwell<br />\ngets his nose back after being proclaimed the god of the<br /><br />\n400 phosphorescent man-eating planaria (worms)<br />\nslither out.

If you arrive as Chastity with a noseless man that is<br />\nnot Cadwell, the man is made the phallic god and--if.<br />\nCadwell doesn't come to your rescue as either the<br />\nWarlord or noseless and seeking the pot--the noseless<br />\nstranger makes you the first sacrifice to the god. However you do not die but become a pair of discarded shoes<br />\nthat forever searches the world for its feet.<br />\n7. If you are there as Cadwell the Warlord, you<br />\nchallenge the noseless imposter to a joust. Though<br />\nyou win the nymphs force you to repent for killing their<br />\nphallic god by cutting off your nose.<br />\n8.

All songs on the<br />\nalbum show a musical finesse and expertise which was not as apparent in previous<br />\nalbums, and more attention has been paid<br />\nto the technical aspects. Gone is most of<br />\nthe R&amp;B raggedness of previous efforts;<br />\nTrust still has the vitality and power of<br />\nthe rhythm and blues sound, but with a<br />\ndash more musical skill.

An underlying chord throughout<br />\nhis previous albums has been his characteristic outrage against the modern<br />\nworld, which he allows to erupt in such<br />\nvolcanic songs as \"Pump It Up,\" \"Less<br />\nThan Zero,\" \"No Action,\" \"Goon<br />\nSquad,\" and \"Five Gears In Reverse.\"<br />\nThis musical vulcanism is not as apparent<br />\non Trust, so one naturally wonders if he<br />\nhas, as many critics have claimed, become<br />\na mellow Costello.<br /><br />\nhave become infinitely more intelligible.<br />\nThe mixing is more meticulous: the<br />\nbalancing of the instruments and the<br />\nfades are accomplished with a greater<br />\nartfulness and skill than before.<br />\nThe ambiguous musical identity<br />\nof the group termed the \"sound\" has also<br />\nchanged.

A ragged rustic, oar in<br />\nhand, slips carefully into the shadows,<br />\navoiding the traveler's searching eyes.<br />\nThe man is Sir Thomas More, and being<br />\nseen with him is considered an insult to<br />\nthe King, Henry VIII. The play is A Man<br />\nFor All Seasons (Center Stage, now<br />\nthrough March 8).<br />\nLady Margaret, (Sir Thomas<br />\nMore's daughter) curtseys before the<br />\nKing. \"Blow!\" he commands, withdrawing a pipe from his robes. She<br />\nblows, signalling the minstrels to begin a<br />\nsong. Then the business begins. The<br />\nKing begs Sir Thomas More, noted<br />\nintellectual and Chancellor of England, to<br />\nreconsider. The King's wife is barren, and<br />\nhe wants a divorce, but the laws of the<br />\nCatholic Church and the State forbid it.<br />\nThe Pope has been ignored, the Catholic<br />\nChurch replaced by the Church of England, and the Parliament has voted the<br />\ndivorce legal, all to give King Henry<br />\nan heir. But More has refused to either<br />\ncondone or condemn the divorce, and his<br />\nsilence is far louder than the pleas of<br />\nParliament.<br />\nSecretary Cromwell sips mead in a<br />\ncandle-lit tavern, devising with his cronies<br />\nlegal threats which could intimidate Sir<br />\nThomas into supporting the marriage.<br />\nLater, echoes in a stone tower whisper,<br />\n\"Treason.\"<br />\nMore, who believes that no man is<br />\nabove the law, yet refuses to betray the<br /><br />\nKing either, decides to abstain from<br />\ncommenting on the divorce. He resigns<br />\nhis post as Chancellor in the hope of<br />\nvanishing from the public eye, but this<br />\nact merely makes him more famous. The<br />\nKing's reputation is being tainted by<br />\nMore's actions, so pressure from Henry<br />\nsteadily grows stronger. More declares<br />\nagain and again that the law must be the ,<br />\ncauseway by which any citizen can walk<br />\nsafely through life, and thus, as he is in<br />\nno way bound by the law to condone the<br />\nKing's divorce, he has no need to fear.<br /><br />\nWhen the King demands that More<br />\nsupport his divorce, and More .refuses,<br />\nthere are accusations of treason. More<br />\nproclaims that when a man's actions are<br />\nforcibly separated from the dictates of his<br />\nconscience by the law itself, society has<br />\ncome to advocate lying and trickery and<br />\npunish honesty. More's conscience is<br />\napparently established by \"God's law,\"<br />\nand therefore human law should, in<br />\nMore's mind, reflect divine will.<br /><br />\nAs a contrast to More, the narrator, called \"The Common Man,\" makes<br />\nthe most of his position as Sir Thomas'<br />\nservant. He accepts countless shillings for<br />\ninformation, without a guilty conscience.<br />\nThe Common Man, in fact, has no conscience.

Both men are self-indulgent and display impersonal attitudes toward their respective partners,<br />\nalike even in their disdain for their<br />\npartners' musical tastes: in \"Babylon<br />\nSisters\" the girl is told to \"turn that<br />\njungle music down,\" while in \"He)<br />\nNineteen\" she is chided for not knowing<br />\nwho Aretha Franklin is. Each man<br />\nattempts to bridge the generation gap by<br />\nmeans of enticement: \"We'll jog with the<br />\nshow-folk on the sand,\" he tells her in<br />\n\"Babylon Sisters\"; in \"Hey Nineteen\" the<br />\ngirl is promised an evening of Cuervo<br />\nGold and \"fine Colombian.\" But ironically, each man is looking for confirmation and appreciation, as stated in the<br />\nrefrains of the songs: as \"Tell me I'm the<br />\nonly one\" is repeated in \"Babylon<br />\nSisters,\" so also is \"Please take me along<br />\nwhen you slide down\" in \"Hey Nineteen.\" Interestingly but perhaps not<br />\nsurprisingly, neither girl responds during<br />\nthe course of each song. It is as if the<br />\nmen are talking to themselves.<br /><br />\nThe plot line is similar in<br />\n\"Gaucho\" except that it seems to include<br />\nhomosexual undertones. In this song, the<br />\nrelationship has gone sour, and the<br />\nprotagonist has become more assertive.<br />\nHe takes his friend's infatuation with a<br />\nstudded-leather cowboy to be just \"one<br />\nmore expensive kiss-off\" and challenges<br />\nhim with the question \"Who do you<br />\nthink I am?\" This is a question that<br />\nmany of the characters on the album<br />\ncould very well be asking themselves.<br />\nAgain, naturally, there is no response<br />\nfrom the second party.<br />\nThe album's final cut is the moody,<br /><br />\nrumbling \"Third World Man,\" and it is<br />\nthe only song in which third-person<br />\nnarrative is employed.
