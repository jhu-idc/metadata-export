In the<br />\nfirst place, it is a well-known and<br />\nobvious fact that men do not come<br />\nto Hopkins for athletics alone, but<br />\nto acquire an education; and they<br />\ngo out for athletics as a sideline,<br />\nand as a sideline only.<br />\nSecondly, \u2022 our undergraduate<br />\nschool, from which most of the<br />\nplayers come, is not large enough.<br />\nThe number of men going out for<br />\nathletics is'too small for any such<br />\nstep.<br />\nThirdly, none of our natural<br />\nrivals, the State teams, work<br />\nunder the one-term rule, and there<br />\nis absolutely no plausible reason<br />\nfor tying our hands, at the same<br />\ntime allowing our opponents to<br />\nplay whomever they choose.<br />\nThe,:old' black-list is all right,<br />\nalthough we feel that it calls for<br />\ntoo high a standard of scholarship,<br />\nbut the time is by no means ripe<br />\nfor the inauguration of the oneterm rule.<br />\n<br />\nSaturday's game showed the results of pitting a comparatively<br />\ngreen and inexperienced team<br />\nagainst a seasoned one.

Without these the game<br />\nwould have resolved itself into a<br />\nhard, close fight, with the edge to<br />\nthe Quakers. Each team was able<br />\nto gain considerable ground thru<br />\nits opponent's line.<br />\nThe interference on running<br />\nback punts and kickoffs shows a<br />\ncrying need for hard drilling.

The<br />\nwork of developing men is so important think coach England and<br />\nCapt Mullikin, that a proposition<br />\nfrom Delaware College for a crosscountry meet will, in all\u2022 probability, be turned down.

A publicity campaign was<br />\nlaunched and suggestions were<br />\nmade to have debates and mock<br />\ntrials in conjunction with the<br />\npresent,proceedure of the Club.<br />\nThe program for Friday, October 29, is an address by Mr. George<br />\nGoetz, on \"Some Aspects of Mr.<br />\nDebs, the Man\"; and a discussion<br />\nof \"Mr. Debs' Political Tenets.\"<br />\nMr. Bernard Ades, in support of<br />\nthem, and Mr. Henry West, in<br />\nopposition.<br /><br />\nNew Site For National Academy of<br />\nScience.<br /><br />\nA site for the new building in<br />\nWashington which is to serve as a<br />\nhome for the National Academy of<br />\nSciences and the National Research Council has recently been<br />\nobtained.

In the<br />\nfirst place, it is a well-known and<br />\nobvious fact that men do not come<br />\nto Hopkins for athletics alone, but<br />\nto acquire an education; and they<br />\ngo out for athletics as a sideline,<br />\nand as a sideline only.<br />\nSecondly, \u2022 our undergraduate<br />\nschool, from which most of the<br />\nplayers come, is not large enough.<br />\nThe number of men going out for<br />\nathletics is'too small for any such<br />\nstep.<br />\nThirdly, none of our natural<br />\nrivals, the State teams, work<br />\nunder the one-term rule, and there<br />\nis absolutely no plausible reason<br />\nfor tying our hands, at the same<br />\ntime allowing our opponents to<br />\nplay whomever they choose.<br />\nThe,:old' black-list is all right,<br />\nalthough we feel that it calls for<br />\ntoo high a standard of scholarship,<br />\nbut the time is by no means ripe<br />\nfor the inauguration of the oneterm rule.<br /><br />\nSaturday's game showed the results of pitting a comparatively<br />\ngreen and inexperienced team<br />\nagainst a seasoned one.
