We sincerely hope that, should a concerted effort be made, everyone concerned will pitch in and not forget that the interest<br />\nof the undergraduate is the prime concern of such a<br />\nprogram.<br />\nWhat do we envisage? We make no claim to be either<br />\narchitects or financiers, but we do feel we should set forth<br />\nsome of the demands and desires of the students as we have<br />\nrecorded them. First, the program should be aimed principally at the dorm student. The reasons are obvious why<br />\nthis is so, but for emphasis, we will state them. The dorm<br />\nstudent is, especially as a freshman, cut off from the<br />\nnormal social activity, in its broadest sense, that he enjoyed while living at his home. The fraternities with their<br />\nhome-away from-home do not offer an answer to most<br />\nstudents, even of those who join.<br />\nWe feel that there should be another answer, and<br />\nwe see a possible solution in the concept of a student union. We do not mean to overlook the 'Y'; if such a move<br />\ncould prove feasible, it might well serve as the nucleus<br />\nfor the expanded program. However, in that case it might<br />\nbe advisable to give the operation a less restrictive title.<br />\n<br />\n\u2014GINNIS<br />\n<br />\nMR. HAROLD E. INGLE<br />\nBy JOEL MILLER<br />\n<br />\n\u2022<br />\n\"Yes, it's true ... the Johns<br />\nHopkins Press is the oldest collegiate press in America that has<br />\nbeen in continual operation,\"<br />\nstated Harold E. Ingle, director<br />\nof the Hopkins Press; \"although<br />\nCornell did organize a press<br />\nsomewhat earlier than us, they<br />\ndisbanded shortly thereafter,<br />\nonly to resume operation at a<br />\nlater date.\"<br />\nSince Mr. Ingle's arrival at<br />\nHopkins from Iowa State College<br />\nin 1949 (\"that's in Ames, you<br />\nknow\"), the Hopkin's Press has<br />\nundergone a dramatic shift in its<br />\noperational policy. From a pre1949 role of sound but passive<br />\nmanagement, the Hopkins Press<br />\nhas been pursuing a more vigorous policy' aimed at increasing<br />\nthe quality and scope of its publications.<br />\nAccording to John Kyle, editorial chief of the Hopkins Press,<br />\nthe transition from old to new<br />\nhas been marked in two particular ways: first, books are now<br />\ngiven individual attention in<br />\nterms of editing and design,,; and<br />\nsecond, a strong sales department has been developed with<br />\nwide advertising, both in this<br />\ncountry and abroad.<br />\n<br />\nWorld-Wide Distribution<br />\nSurprisingly enough, the HopOne main requirement in line with the emphasis on kins Press is well represented in<br />\nthe dorm man is that some facility be provided nearer the \"all parts of the world.\" Hopkins<br />\nbooks are sold in such areas as<br />\ndorms than Levering Hall. Ideally, we favor an entirely South<br />\nAmerica, Europe, and the<br />\nnew building built between the dorms and Gilman Hall; Orient. \"We'll sell over $35,000<br />\npossibly A site near the White House would offer the best worth of books on the foreign<br />\ncompromise.

Another method, also<br />\nthe students, both individually and organization-wise.

Each press promotes the sale of books for one<br />\nanother in its own respective<br />\nterritory. It can be considered a<br />\n\"triangular\" type of operation.<br />\nWhen Mr. Ingle assumed his<br />\nduties as director of the Hopkins<br />\nPress in 1949, the sales volume<br />\nwas approximately $80,000. This<br />\nyear, sales are expected to exceed the $250,000 mark. Of this<br />\namount, about fifteen percent<br />\nwill consist of foreign sales. The<br />\nsteady increase in volume indicates the effectiveness of the<br />\nnew program.<br />\n\"The future? . ..

The article tended a<br />\nlittle to picture an academic<br />\nlamb surrounded by publicity<br />\nwolves. Mr. Poole and his colleagues may be wolves, albeit very<br />\namiable ones, but I am far from<br />\nbeing a lamb.<br />\nAs your article stated Mr. Poole<br />\nand I have been trying for several years to think of a mediaval program that would be effective. This fall we decided to<br />\ntry chivalry. I gave Mr. Poole my<br />\nbook French Chivalry and a lecture I have used , a number of<br />\ntimes under different titles. He<br />\nthen wrote the first draft of a<br />\nscript which I read over and<br />\nmath; a few changes in. He then<br />\ngave me another draft in which<br />\nI again made some changes.<br />\nThen in the first two rehearsals<br />\nat the studio I made several more<br />\nchanges in the text. Finally I<br />\nchanged one or two places in<br />\nthe actual broadcast. The answer<br />\nto the question of why I made<br />\nthese changes is very simple\u2014<br />\nsome things which look well on<br />\nPaper do not sound well when<br />\nspoken. As I had only been on<br />\ntelevision twice before and had<br />\nnever before read from a script,<br />\nI suspect that I was too tense<br />\nand did not read too well. I<br />\nmight add that I supplied Mr.<br />\nPoole with the pictures he used<br />\nand the passages that were read<br />\non the stage.<br />\nI am a mediaevalist and Mr.<br />\nPoole is a television producer.<br />\nI left the problems of arranging<br />\nthe program to him and his staff.<br />\nIf President Eisenhower sat<br />\ntangled up in an electrical cord,<br />\nthat was\u2014as I said to your reporter\u2014their worry not mine.<br />\nBut I was fully responsible for<br />\nthe accuracy of the program. I<br />\napproved the setting, and costumes, the action, and the parts<br />\nread by the announcers and several things were changed at my<br />\nrequest. There may well have<br />\nbeen inaccuracies. I do not know<br />\nthat mediaeval knights slapped<br />\ntheir ladies' behinds, but the<br />\ngesture seemed a pleasant one<br />\nand fully in the spirit of the occasion.<br />\nAs a teacher I am interested<br />\nIn the diffusion of knowledge to<br />\n<br />\nall the people by all known<br />\nmedia. This program Was an experiment. It tried to present on<br />\ntelevision an age for which we<br />\nhave little pictorial material.<br />\nEven more 'difficult it was essentially a study in the history<br />\nof ideas. Television is an extremely important medium of<br />\ngeneral education today and I<br />\nam anxious to see the Humanities represented on it. I think<br />\nMr. Poole, his staff, and the staff<br />\nof station WAAM showed both<br />\nimagination and ingenuity in devising pictorial representation of<br />\nmy material. The text was obviously thin, but when a hundred and twenty-five page book<br />\nis compressed into some twenty<br />\nminutes, it cannot be precise and<br />\ndetailed. I believe, however, that<br />\nit was accurate and that viewers<br />\nof the program got a sound if<br />\nslender picture of the subject.<br />\nI might add that we have received a number of favorable<br />\ncomments.<br />\nLet me thank you again for<br />\nthe space you gave to this subject.

The 1956 Roll Call<br />\nraised a record $212,775, which<br />\nis equivalent to the income of a<br />\nprincipal of nearly six million<br />\ndollars, while other alumni gifts<br />\ntotaled $176,953. According to<br />\nOsmar P. Steinwald, Director of<br />\nAlumni Relations, the Roll Call<br />\nhas raised $1,330,927 since it was<br />\ninitiated in 1947 to offset the<br />\nincreased deficits arising after<br />\nthe war.<br />\nSteinwald expec ts a continued increase in contributions<br />\nfrom the Roll Call, which has<br />\nseen the number of donors and<br />\ntotal amount of gifts more than<br />\ndouble in the past ten years.<br />\nThe tenth Annual Roll Call<br />\nalone increased by more than<br />\nthe combined growth of the three<br />\nprevious years. \"We are expanding our regional work and expect<br />\ncontinued assistance from Dr.<br />\nEisenhower, who has been a<br />\ngreat benefit to us, speaking at<br />\nsix alumni meetings in the past<br />\n<br />\nseveral weeks. I believe that<br />\nthere is still a great potential<br />\nsource of funds in the alumni<br />\nroll call. I don't think we have<br />\nreached the saturation point.\"<br />\n\"Living Endowment\"<br />\nThe significance of the Roll<br />\nCall is that it may be looked<br />\nupon as a \"living endowment.\"<br />\nIt is a regular source of funds,<br />\nthe bulk of which is unrestricted.<br />\nAs Dr. Eisenhower stated, \"our<br />\nefforts to raise funds from other<br />\nsources are increasingly productive, but it is worth noting that<br />\nalumni gifts remain the largest<br />\nsingle source of the unrestricted<br />\nfunds which are so vitally needed to keep the total program<br />\nwell-balanced.\"<br />\nDr. Eisenhower has pointed<br />\nout that the four phases of<br />\nfund-raising are interrelated.<br />\nFor example, Dr. Eisenhower<br />\nstated, \"alumni giving also has<br />\nimportant side effect's. A healthy<br />\nrecord of alumni support encourages gifts from non-alumni<br />\n<br />\nindividuals, from industries, and<br />\nfrom industrial foundations. In<br />\nfact, more than forty industrial<br />\nconcerns directly relate their<br />\ncontributions to higher education to alumni support by their<br />\nemployees.

We sincerely hope that, should a concerted effort be made, everyone concerned will pitch in and not forget that the interest<br />\nof the undergraduate is the prime concern of such a<br />\nprogram.<br />\nWhat do we envisage? We make no claim to be either<br />\narchitects or financiers, but we do feel we should set forth<br />\nsome of the demands and desires of the students as we have<br />\nrecorded them. First, the program should be aimed principally at the dorm student. The reasons are obvious why<br />\nthis is so, but for emphasis, we will state them. The dorm<br />\nstudent is, especially as a freshman, cut off from the<br />\nnormal social activity, in its broadest sense, that he enjoyed while living at his home. The fraternities with their<br />\nhome-away from-home do not offer an answer to most<br />\nstudents, even of those who join.<br />\nWe feel that there should be another answer, and<br />\nwe see a possible solution in the concept of a student union. We do not mean to overlook the 'Y'; if such a move<br />\ncould prove feasible, it might well serve as the nucleus<br />\nfor the expanded program. However, in that case it might<br />\nbe advisable to give the operation a less restrictive title.<br /><br />\n\u2014GINNIS<br /><br />\nMR. HAROLD E. INGLE<br />\nBy JOEL MILLER<br /><br />\n\u2022<br />\n\"Yes, it's true ... the Johns<br />\nHopkins Press is the oldest collegiate press in America that has<br />\nbeen in continual operation,\"<br />\nstated Harold E. Ingle, director<br />\nof the Hopkins Press; \"although<br />\nCornell did organize a press<br />\nsomewhat earlier than us, they<br />\ndisbanded shortly thereafter,<br />\nonly to resume operation at a<br />\nlater date.\"<br />\nSince Mr. Ingle's arrival at<br />\nHopkins from Iowa State College<br />\nin 1949 (\"that's in Ames, you<br />\nknow\"), the Hopkin's Press has<br />\nundergone a dramatic shift in its<br />\noperational policy. From a pre1949 role of sound but passive<br />\nmanagement, the Hopkins Press<br />\nhas been pursuing a more vigorous policy' aimed at increasing<br />\nthe quality and scope of its publications.<br />\nAccording to John Kyle, editorial chief of the Hopkins Press,<br />\nthe transition from old to new<br />\nhas been marked in two particular ways: first, books are now<br />\ngiven individual attention in<br />\nterms of editing and design,,; and<br />\nsecond, a strong sales department has been developed with<br />\nwide advertising, both in this<br />\ncountry and abroad.<br /><br />\nWorld-Wide Distribution<br />\nSurprisingly enough, the HopOne main requirement in line with the emphasis on kins Press is well represented in<br />\nthe dorm man is that some facility be provided nearer the \"all parts of the world.\" Hopkins<br />\nbooks are sold in such areas as<br />\ndorms than Levering Hall. Ideally, we favor an entirely South<br />\nAmerica, Europe, and the<br />\nnew building built between the dorms and Gilman Hall; Orient. \"We'll sell over $35,000<br />\npossibly A site near the White House would offer the best worth of books on the foreign<br />\ncompromise.

Each press promotes the sale of books for one<br />\nanother in its own respective<br />\nterritory. It can be considered a<br />\n\"triangular\" type of operation.<br />\nWhen Mr. Ingle assumed his<br />\nduties as director of the Hopkins<br />\nPress in 1949, the sales volume<br />\nwas approximately $80,000. This<br />\nyear, sales are expected to exceed the $250,000 mark. Of this<br />\namount, about fifteen percent<br />\nwill consist of foreign sales. The<br />\nsteady increase in volume indicates the effectiveness of the<br />\nnew program.<br />\n\"The future? . .. Well, primarily, we'd like to expand our<br />\nprogram for interpreting pertinent research findings to those<br />\npeople who are intellectually<br />\ncurious,\" he answered..The Hopkins Press is planning to publish<br />\na series of \u2022 paper-bound books<br />\nconcerned with such topics as:<br />\nabuses of antibiotics, sterility,<br />\nold age, radiation effects, and<br />\nheart surgery.

The article tended a<br />\nlittle to picture an academic<br />\nlamb surrounded by publicity<br />\nwolves. Mr. Poole and his colleagues may be wolves, albeit very<br />\namiable ones, but I am far from<br />\nbeing a lamb.<br />\nAs your article stated Mr. Poole<br />\nand I have been trying for several years to think of a mediaval program that would be effective. This fall we decided to<br />\ntry chivalry. I gave Mr. Poole my<br />\nbook French Chivalry and a lecture I have used , a number of<br />\ntimes under different titles. He<br />\nthen wrote the first draft of a<br />\nscript which I read over and<br />\nmath; a few changes in. He then<br />\ngave me another draft in which<br />\nI again made some changes.<br />\nThen in the first two rehearsals<br />\nat the studio I made several more<br />\nchanges in the text. Finally I<br />\nchanged one or two places in<br />\nthe actual broadcast. The answer<br />\nto the question of why I made<br />\nthese changes is very simple\u2014<br />\nsome things which look well on<br />\nPaper do not sound well when<br />\nspoken. As I had only been on<br />\ntelevision twice before and had<br />\nnever before read from a script,<br />\nI suspect that I was too tense<br />\nand did not read too well. I<br />\nmight add that I supplied Mr.<br />\nPoole with the pictures he used<br />\nand the passages that were read<br />\non the stage.<br />\nI am a mediaevalist and Mr.<br />\nPoole is a television producer.<br />\nI left the problems of arranging<br />\nthe program to him and his staff.<br />\nIf President Eisenhower sat<br />\ntangled up in an electrical cord,<br />\nthat was\u2014as I said to your reporter\u2014their worry not mine.<br />\nBut I was fully responsible for<br />\nthe accuracy of the program. I<br />\napproved the setting, and costumes, the action, and the parts<br />\nread by the announcers and several things were changed at my<br />\nrequest. There may well have<br />\nbeen inaccuracies. I do not know<br />\nthat mediaeval knights slapped<br />\ntheir ladies' behinds, but the<br />\ngesture seemed a pleasant one<br />\nand fully in the spirit of the occasion.<br />\nAs a teacher I am interested<br />\nIn the diffusion of knowledge to<br /><br />\nall the people by all known<br />\nmedia. This program Was an experiment. It tried to present on<br />\ntelevision an age for which we<br />\nhave little pictorial material.<br />\nEven more 'difficult it was essentially a study in the history<br />\nof ideas. Television is an extremely important medium of<br />\ngeneral education today and I<br />\nam anxious to see the Humanities represented on it. I think<br />\nMr. Poole, his staff, and the staff<br />\nof station WAAM showed both<br />\nimagination and ingenuity in devising pictorial representation of<br />\nmy material.

The 1956 Roll Call<br />\nraised a record $212,775, which<br />\nis equivalent to the income of a<br />\nprincipal of nearly six million<br />\ndollars, while other alumni gifts<br />\ntotaled $176,953. According to<br />\nOsmar P.

I believe that<br />\nthere is still a great potential<br />\nsource of funds in the alumni<br />\nroll call. I don't think we have<br />\nreached the saturation point.\"<br />\n\"Living Endowment\"<br />\nThe significance of the Roll<br />\nCall is that it may be looked<br />\nupon as a \"living endowment.\"<br />\nIt is a regular source of funds,<br />\nthe bulk of which is unrestricted.<br />\nAs Dr. Eisenhower stated, \"our<br />\nefforts to raise funds from other<br />\nsources are increasingly productive, but it is worth noting that<br />\nalumni gifts remain the largest<br />\nsingle source of the unrestricted<br />\nfunds which are so vitally needed to keep the total program<br />\nwell-balanced.\"<br />\nDr. Eisenhower has pointed<br />\nout that the four phases of<br />\nfund-raising are interrelated.<br />\nFor example, Dr. Eisenhower<br />\nstated, \"alumni giving also has<br />\nimportant side effect's. A healthy<br />\nrecord of alumni support encourages gifts from non-alumni<br /><br />\nindividuals, from industries, and<br />\nfrom industrial foundations. In<br />\nfact, more than forty industrial<br />\nconcerns directly relate their<br />\ncontributions to higher education to alumni support by their<br />\nemployees. It must be obvious,<br />\nthen, why all of us here consider<br />\nthe alumni program so vital to<br />\nthe future of The Hopkins.\"<br />\nReputation Important<br />\nAccording to Lynn Poole, director of public relations, what<br />\na University does day by \u2022 day,<br />\nweek by week, and year by year,<br />\nhas great bearing on funds and<br />\nstudents.
