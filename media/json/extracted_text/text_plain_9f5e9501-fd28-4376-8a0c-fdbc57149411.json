Its five<br />\nmajor laboratories conduct basic, applied, and developmental<br />\nresearch in these fields:<br />\nHYDRODYNAMICS\u2014Hydrofoilcraft,interface vehicles, novel<br />\nship types, fluid dynamics, high-speed phenomena.<br />\nAERODYNAMICS\u2014Aircushion vehicles, weapon release<br />\nproblems, V/STOL aircraft, aircraft performance.<br />\nSTRUCTURAL MECHANICS\u2014Submarine and surface ship<br />\nstructures, effects of underwater and surface explosions, ship<br />\nand personnel protection, deep-sea research vehicles.<br />\nAPPLIED MATHEMATICS\u2014Computer-aided ship and system design, automated data processing, numerical techniques,<br />\nmanagement data analysis.<br />\nACOUSTICS AND VIBRATION\u2014Radiated, near-field, self<br />\nand hydrodynamic noise, countermeasures, silencing devices,<br />\nnoise transmission.<br />\nAn engineering or scientific career at the David Taylor Model<br />\nBasin offers you many advantages:<br />\n1. Because of the mission of the Model Basin, you can be sure<br />\nthat you will be engaged in research, development, test and<br />\nevaluation not as a bystander, but as an active and increasingly<br />\nimportant participant. Whatever your discipline, you will have<br />\nthe opportunity to apply it to one of the important projects in<br />\nwhich the Model Basin is engaged.<br />\n2. You will have the satisfaction and excitement of working<br />\non projects that advance the state of the art and are of national<br />\nand international importance.<br />\n3. Working with you will be men whose engineering and scientific achievements have earned them wide reputations in<br />\ntheir fields. Your contact with them will be of immeasurable<br />\nvalue in your own development as a professional engineer or<br />\nscientist.<br />\n4. You will work in a campus-like environment with 186 acres<br />\nof laboratories and supporting facilities with millions of dollars<br />\nworth of equipment. For instance, the Hydromechanics Lab-<br />\n<br />\noratory has a Towing Basin 3/5 of a mile long, 50 feet wide,<br />\nand 20 feet deep; a Maneuvering Basin that covers 5 acres.<br />\nThe Applied Mathematics Laboratory uses four high-speed<br />\ndigital computers to solve engineering and logistic problems.<br />\nThe ultra-high-speed UNIVAC LARC performs 250,000 computations per second. The Aerodynamics Laboratory is equipped<br />\nwith nine wind tunnels, subsonic, transonic, supersonic, hypersonic, for the testing of aircraft, missile and airborne component models. Ten pressure tanks, and tensile and compressive load testing machines are among the devices used by the<br />\nStructural Mechanics Laboratory in research on hull structures<br />\nfor ships, deep-diving submarines and deep-sea research<br />\nvehicles. Mechanical generators in the Acoustics and Vibration Laboratory can produce known forces in structures ranging from small items of machinery to complete ships.<br />\n5. The management of the Model Basin is interested in your<br />\nprofessional development. It provides you with the opportunity to receive financial assistance and time(up to 8 hours a<br />\nweek)to attend classes at one of the six major universities in<br />\nthe immediate area, which offer courses in virtually every<br />\nfield. In addition, a number of graduate courses are conducted<br />\nat the Model Basin. Under a new program, several employees<br />\n34 -time advanced academic study<br />\nare now engaged in full or /<br />\nand receiving full salary as well as all their expenses.<br />\n6. At the David Taylor Model Basin, you can reach the<br />\n$10,000 to $12,000 level within four years. In addition, as a<br />\nCivil Service employee, you get generous vacations and sick<br />\nleave, inexpensive life and health insurance, and enjoy the<br />\nbenefits of an unusually liberal retirement program.<br />\n7. Within minutes of the Model Basin are the suburbs of<br />\nMaryland and Virginia offering excellent living conditions, unusual recreational facilities, and some of the best public school<br />\nsystems in the country. Because the Washington area is a center for scientific research as well as for government, it boasts a<br />\nlarge concentration of people of intellectual and cultural attainments. Washingtor4 D.

The list is wide\u2014<br />\nranging from OAS Secretary General Jose Mora, through<br />\nsuch luminaries as.Joseph Alsop, to Dave Brubeek. It<br />\nis deep, too-23 guest speakers are planned. Two observations are in order.<br />\nOne, Hopkins can he proud that notice of the appearance of Bayard Bustin passed virtually without<br />\ncomment. When Bustin was scheduled to speak at the<br />\nUniversity of Maryland, furor from diverse elements<br />\nalmost cancelled the program. Homewood has again<br />\nproven that it is mature enough to endure, without adverse commentary, the appearance of one whose beliefs may not be universally held.<br />\nTwo, while sponsorship of the various speakers<br />\nlies with a nuniber of campus organizations\u2014from Phi<br />\nBeta Kappa to Levering Hall--credit for the mammoth<br />\njob of organization and coordinates rests with the University's Committee on Special Events. Public Relations<br />\nmen invariably resent acknowledgement in the press of<br />\ntheir efforts, so kudos for the execution of a fine program go to COSE chairman J.S. and able assistants T.K.<br />\nand G.S.W.<br />\n<br />\nBooksfore, Con't.<br />\nAt this semiannual juncture, the Bookstore again<br />\nrears its .... head, Hopefully, expansion will alleviate<br />\nat least the inefficiency of purchasing books and supplies.

This<br />\nmight explain why a random re-gistration day sampling<br />\nshowed, for instance, Dr. Rothstein's New Nations in<br />\nWorld Affairs over the 30 mark at midday, or Dr.<br />\nAmbrose's War in the Modern World pushing 90 in<br />\nenrollment as registration neared closing.<br />\nIt is not enough to say that such courses as these<br />\nexcite students' interests so much that many went to<br />\ntake them; a good proportion of those enrolled are<br />\nsimply looking for something that \"sounds good\". And<br />\nnot that much sounds good; there really isn't that<br />\nmuch to begin with. Also, if a course is not listed and<br />\ndescribed in the undergraduate catalogue, then it should<br />\nbe adequately described in the course list issued by<br />\nthe registrar's office just prior to semester break.<br />\n<br />\nWay to Hop<br />\nWe wholeheartedly commend Dr. Eisenhower for<br />\nhis announcement that, beginning this autumn, the University housing Bureau will refuse to list private and<br />\ncommercial landlords who do not pledge to accept applications from Hopkins persons without regard to race,<br />\ncolor or national origin.<br />\n<br />\nAn Explanation<br />\nSharp-eyed readers will notice that this issue's<br />\nmasthead lists new editors-in-chief.

They,1<br />\nbraided the hair on top of their heads,and as for the hair on<br />\ntheir faces, they had none. The barber, Tremblatt Follicle<br />\nby name,grew so depressed staring day after day at 16emp\u2022<br />\nty chairs that one day his mind gave way.Seizing his vibrator, he ran outside and shook the entire campus till it crumbled to dust.

Its five<br />\nmajor laboratories conduct basic, applied, and developmental<br />\nresearch in these fields:<br />\nHYDRODYNAMICS\u2014Hydrofoilcraft,interface vehicles, novel<br />\nship types, fluid dynamics, high-speed phenomena.<br />\nAERODYNAMICS\u2014Aircushion vehicles, weapon release<br />\nproblems, V/STOL aircraft, aircraft performance.<br />\nSTRUCTURAL MECHANICS\u2014Submarine and surface ship<br />\nstructures, effects of underwater and surface explosions, ship<br />\nand personnel protection, deep-sea research vehicles.<br />\nAPPLIED MATHEMATICS\u2014Computer-aided ship and system design, automated data processing, numerical techniques,<br />\nmanagement data analysis.<br />\nACOUSTICS AND VIBRATION\u2014Radiated, near-field, self<br />\nand hydrodynamic noise, countermeasures, silencing devices,<br />\nnoise transmission.<br />\nAn engineering or scientific career at the David Taylor Model<br />\nBasin offers you many advantages:<br />\n1. Because of the mission of the Model Basin, you can be sure<br />\nthat you will be engaged in research, development, test and<br />\nevaluation not as a bystander, but as an active and increasingly<br />\nimportant participant. Whatever your discipline, you will have<br />\nthe opportunity to apply it to one of the important projects in<br />\nwhich the Model Basin is engaged.<br />\n2. You will have the satisfaction and excitement of working<br />\non projects that advance the state of the art and are of national<br />\nand international importance.<br />\n3. Working with you will be men whose engineering and scientific achievements have earned them wide reputations in<br />\ntheir fields. Your contact with them will be of immeasurable<br />\nvalue in your own development as a professional engineer or<br />\nscientist.<br />\n4. You will work in a campus-like environment with 186 acres<br />\nof laboratories and supporting facilities with millions of dollars<br />\nworth of equipment. For instance, the Hydromechanics Lab-<br /><br />\noratory has a Towing Basin 3/5 of a mile long, 50 feet wide,<br />\nand 20 feet deep; a Maneuvering Basin that covers 5 acres.<br />\nThe Applied Mathematics Laboratory uses four high-speed<br />\ndigital computers to solve engineering and logistic problems.<br />\nThe ultra-high-speed UNIVAC LARC performs 250,000 computations per second. The Aerodynamics Laboratory is equipped<br />\nwith nine wind tunnels, subsonic, transonic, supersonic, hypersonic, for the testing of aircraft, missile and airborne component models. Ten pressure tanks, and tensile and compressive load testing machines are among the devices used by the<br />\nStructural Mechanics Laboratory in research on hull structures<br />\nfor ships, deep-diving submarines and deep-sea research<br />\nvehicles. Mechanical generators in the Acoustics and Vibration Laboratory can produce known forces in structures ranging from small items of machinery to complete ships.<br />\n5. The management of the Model Basin is interested in your<br />\nprofessional development. It provides you with the opportunity to receive financial assistance and time(up to 8 hours a<br />\nweek)to attend classes at one of the six major universities in<br />\nthe immediate area, which offer courses in virtually every<br />\nfield. In addition, a number of graduate courses are conducted<br />\nat the Model Basin. Under a new program, several employees<br />\n34 -time advanced academic study<br />\nare now engaged in full or /<br />\nand receiving full salary as well as all their expenses.<br />\n6. At the David Taylor Model Basin, you can reach the<br />\n$10,000 to $12,000 level within four years. In addition, as a<br />\nCivil Service employee, you get generous vacations and sick<br />\nleave, inexpensive life and health insurance, and enjoy the<br />\nbenefits of an unusually liberal retirement program.<br />\n7. Within minutes of the Model Basin are the suburbs of<br />\nMaryland and Virginia offering excellent living conditions, unusual recreational facilities, and some of the best public school<br />\nsystems in the country. Because the Washington area is a center for scientific research as well as for government, it boasts a<br />\nlarge concentration of people of intellectual and cultural attainments. Washingtor4 D.

Mr.Mather<br />\nbuilt schools of liberal arts, tine arts, dentistry and tanning.

The student'<br />\nbody, being drawn chiefly from the nearby countryside,<br />\nwas composed almost entirely of Pequot and Iroquois Indiens who, alas, had no need of a barber shop. They,1<br />\nbraided the hair on top of their heads,and as for the hair on<br />\ntheir faces, they had none. The barber, Tremblatt Follicle<br />\nby name,grew so depressed staring day after day at 16emp\u2022<br />\nty chairs that one day his mind gave way.Seizing his vibrator, he ran outside and shook the entire campus till it crumbled to dust.
