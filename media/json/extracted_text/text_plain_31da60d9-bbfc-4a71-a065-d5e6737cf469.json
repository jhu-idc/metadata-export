R.<br />\nMurphy, the new director of athletics, outlined his plans for the<br />\nComing seasons. He first asked<br />\nfor a full and hearty co-operation<br />\nof the students, for faith in his experience, and for toleration in<br />\nthose details that may not be entirely plain at the beginning.<br />\nThe speaker stated that he had<br />\nbeen a close observer of Hopkins<br />\nathletic matters for five years, and<br />\nhad arrived at the conclusion that<br />\nthe apparent lack of interest in<br />\nathletics of so many of the students is due to the lack of facilities. The question to be decided<br />\nis: Shall we stagnate and wait<br />\nfor these facilities, or shall we<br />\nforce -dip' across by a strong exhibition of interest?<br />\nThe faculty, he announced, is<br />\nready to help as much as lies in<br />\ns power. The students in the<br />\nvarious departments will be allowed to use the lockers for athletic purposes, and the showers as<br />\nwell. The big thing, he stated, to<br />\ndo now is to get going\u2014to complete the card registration and<br />\ntake a part.<br />\nMilitary experience in this war,<br />\ndeclared Mr. Murphy, has shown<br />\nthe moral obligation of every student to be physically fit, as well<br />\nas ready. For this reason alone<br />\nwe should all take some physical<br />\ntraining. This physical training<br />\nand the athletic activities will<br />\nboth be under a common head.<br />\nOne big drawback to universal<br />\nParticipation in athletics has been<br />\nuneven competition. A very small<br />\npercentage of the students, and<br />\nreally the ones who need the development the least, now get the<br />\nlion's share of the training and<br />\nSport. In the new system in<br />\nwhich inter-class contests will be<br />\na feature, the men will be divided<br />\ninto groups, according to their<br />\nathletic and physical development<br />\n. and ability. Those men who are<br />\nnot so highly developed physically\u2014and these are usually the ones<br />\nwho take no interest in things<br />\nathletic \u2014 will meet each other<br />\nin these contests without being over-shadowed by the \"star\"<br />\nathletes.

W. Hogue, the leader of<br />\nthe Sunday Open Forum. Dr.<br />\nHogue said that industrial democracy, a pressing problem of<br />\nthe day, was essential and that its<br />\nsolution was possible and, in fact,<br />\ninevitable. The great question is,<br />\nhe said, how will it be accomplished? Will it be through anarchy and revolution or can it be<br />\nevolved by peaceful means?<br />\nThe speaker quoted several<br />\nmagazine articles and editorials<br />\nwritten by members of the employing class, which pointed out that<br />\nthe time has come when workers<br />\nin all branches of industry must<br />\nno longer be treated as \"hands,\"<br />\nbut as human beings; when those<br />\nwho do the lowly work, as well as<br />\nthose who direct, must share in<br />\nthe proceeds of their labor instead<br />\nof merely being given \"wages\";<br />\nwhen there shall be legal compulsion for children to go to school<br />\nuntil a certain age, preventing<br />\ntheir childhood being burnt out in<br />\nthe forge of industry; when a sufficient wage is paid \"to enable<br />\nthe worker to maintain himself<br />\nand his family in health and honor, with such a margin of leisure<br />\nas will permit reasonable recreation and the development of mind<br />\nand spirit.\"<br />\nJohn D. Rockefeller, Jr., said<br />\nat a recent meeting of business<br />\nmen that it was not adequate<br />\nhours or adequate wages that are<br />\nneeded, but that the secret is adequate representation for labor.<br />\nThis partnership between labor<br />\nand capital must not be superficial, but must be worked out<br />\nfrom the bottom up and must be<br />\nsincere.<br />\nWhen asked in what manner he<br />\nbelieved the change would come<br />\nabout, Dr. Hogue answered that<br />\nunless measures are soon taken<br />\nalong the lines of industrial democracy by the employing or<br />\n\"capitalist\" class, the manner in<br />\nwhich this ideal will come about<br />\nwill be one of revolution and<br />\nforce. If, however, more men like<br />\nMr. Rockefeller sincerely have the<br />\nvision and have the courage to<br />\nact as they believe right, the<br />\n\"brotherhood in industry\" may be<br />\nrealized without strife and with<br />\nlittle loss of energy.<br />\n<br />\nThe following appointments for<br />\nThe Johns Hopkins R. 0.

We now have<br />\nthe right type of coach, whom one<br />\nlive wire characterized as having<br />\n\"Inore life in him than ally one in<br />\nthe University.\" We needed a man<br />\n\\vim had at heart the future of<br />\nHopkins athletics and .the soundness- of our athletic policy,'rather<br />\nthan the turning out of a few State<br />\nchampionship teams,\u2014 one who<br />\nwould rather develop a team of<br />\nraw, but loyal, fighting workers<br />\nand an adequate squad of understudies as a nucleus for the following years, than coax out previously developed graduate students,<br />\nwho of necessity can give neither<br />\n-the time nor the spirit to practice.<br />\nWe needed, moreover, a man who<br />\nwas more interested in athletics<br />\nfor all, a means to the end of<br />\npermanently ,silccessful\u2022 'Varsity<br />\nteams, than in athletics merely for<br />\nthe favored few who need it least.<br />\nMr. Murphy bids fair perfectly<br />\nto fulfill these qualifications. For<br />\nfive years he has observed the Hopkins athletic policy, which h.as<br />\nbeen one of more or less haphazard<br />\nopportunism, especially in regard<br />\nto football. In past years, we<br />\nmade no provision for football future. We appealed to the Medical<br />\nSchool stars' loyalty, and they<br />\n<br />\nfiuially consented to play. Each<br />\nyear we hoped that enough readymade material would enter the<br />\nUniversity, but we made little attempt at preliminary training of<br />\n'Varsity material \u2014 the rounding<br />\nof the underclassmen into form.<br />\nThe past two seasons have<br />\nmarked a departure from that system. In 1917, there were only six<br />\ngraduates .on the football squad,<br />\nand never more than three of these<br />\nplayed in any one game; all of<br />\nthem came out solely because of<br />\ntheir loyalty and love of sport.<br />\nThe 1918 team was undergraduate<br />\non account of the S. A. T. C. The<br />\nspring teams have in the past been<br />\nslightly more fortunate than the<br />\nfootball team in having a basis for<br />\nLast<br />\nperpetuating themselves.<br />\nyear's lacrosse team had no graduates, and the baseball team only<br />\ntwo; but we can easily recall the<br />\ntime when the baseball team<br />\nboasted comparatively few undergraduates. Thus, there has been<br />\nsome effort at amelioration.<br />\nThe vital question arises: Are<br />\nwe to revert to the old, lackadaisical system? Mr. Murphy's installation leaves no doubt as to the<br />\nanswer. We have his statement<br />\nthat, if the graduate is permitted<br />\nto play, he will have no special<br />\nprivileges, and must practice as<br />\nfaithfully as any other candidate.<br />\nMr. Murphy, moreover, intends to<br />\ndevote a great part of his attention to developing raw material,<br />\nwhich may not make the 'Varsity<br />\nfor two or three years, but which<br />\nwill at least insure trained squads<br />\nfor the following years. We will<br />\nnot then be left with the vague<br />\nhope that new, ready-developed<br />\nfootball players will choose Hopkins as their Alma Mater.<br />\nEven more than Coach Murphy's<br />\nsystem of preliminary training of<br />\n'Varsity material, we welcome his<br />\nPlan of un;versal athletic particiThe whole collegiate<br />\npation.<br />\nworld is undergoing a reaction<br />\nfrom the overspecialized, overorganized, commercialized intercollegiate athletics of several<br />\nyears ago,\u2014a reaction clearly<br />\n'llown in the last meeting of the<br />\nIntercollegiate Athletic Association in \"New York.

He has<br />\n<br />\nfound that the main factor in<br />\nkeeping many men from engaging<br />\nin athletics is uneven competition.<br />\nHe will attempt to solve this problem by dividing the student body<br />\ninto classes, according to their<br />\nathletic ability and experience,<br />\nand providing for intramural contests between those of like attainments.<br />\nOne obstacle to this plan is lack<br />\nof facilities, but this want will<br />\nbe filled when, by universal interest, we force it upon the attention of the University authorities.<br />\nThen we shall get our gym, our<br />\nHomewood cage, and our pool.<br />\nEven if all these'acquisitions are<br />\nnot made within our l'iliversity<br />\nEfe, we shall at least have laid<br />\nthe foundation for our student<br />\nposterity to buill upon.<br />\nThe issue is all-important to future Hopkins athletics.

The<br />\nonly possible way to avoid this,<br />\nit was stated, is to organize one<br />\ngreat league, including all the<br />\ngreat Powers and such of the lesser Powers as it may be deemed expedient to admit.<br />\nAs to the character of such a<br />\nleague, the writer believe that it<br />\ngi * * * should be a loose confederation, its central organ should<br />\nbe legislative and advisory, and<br />\nits main idea should be co-operation rather than coercion. What<br />\nis needed most is a channel for<br />\nthe focusing and expression of international public opinion. * * *<br />\n\" * * * I think that the most<br />\nwe can safely demand at present<br />\nis a proportional limitation of<br />\narmaments and that the policing<br />\nof the seas and disorderly countries will have to be done in most<br />\ncases by the fleet of the Power<br />\nmost vitally concerned in the<br />\nquarter of the globe which has to<br />\nbe policed. * * *<br />\n\" * * * But whatever form the<br />\nleague may take, its primary object is the protection of the weak<br />\nand the vindication of justice and<br />\nright. It is difficult to see how<br />\nany such league could be considered inconsistent with the Monroe Doctrine.\"<br />\n<br />\nDr. Latane Contributes Article to<br />\nWorld's Work Showing League not<br />\na Violation of Monroe Doctrine.<br />\n<br />\nIn a timely contribution to the<br />\nWorld's Work for February, entitled \"The League of Nations and<br />\nthe Monroe Doctrine,\" Dr. John<br />\nH. Latane shows that in entering<br />\na League of Nations, the United<br />\nStates would not be disregarding<br />\nthe Monroe Doctrine, but would<br />\nbe extending this principle to the<br />\nwhole world. Moreover, the entrance of the United States into<br />\nsuch a league would not be a violation of the American policy of<br />\nisolation, but in a sense would be<br />\nthe extension of that principle<br />\nalso to the nations of the world.<br />\nThe resolutions introduced recently by Senator Knox and Senator Borah indicate that, in the<br />\nminds of many, the Monroe Doctrine seems to be an obstacle to<br />\nthe entrance of the United States<br />\ninto a League of Nations. Dr.<br />\nLatane goes on to say:<br />\n\"The Monroe Doctrine was in<br />\nits origin nothing more than the<br />\nassertion, with special reference<br />\nto the American continents, of the<br />\nright of independent states to<br />\npursue their own careers without<br />\nfear or threat of intervention,<br />\ndomination or subjugation by<br />\nother states. * * * It will be seen<br />\nat once that this is the principle<br />\nfor which the Allies have been<br />\nfighting in this war, and when the<br />\n\u2022President called upon Congress to<br />\ndeclare war on Germany he said<br />\nthat we would fight 'for the rights<br />\nand liberties of small nations, for<br />\na universal domination or right by<br />\nsuch a concert of free peoples as<br />\nshall bring peace and safety to all<br />\nnations and make the world itself at last free.' No Senator<br />\nraised his voice in protest. * * *<br />\nWhy should United States Senators or anybody else think that in<br />\nextending this principle we are in<br />\nany way impairing it? If the<br />\nMonroe Doctrine is a sound principle and has been vindicated by<br />\nthe experience of a hundred years<br />\nin this hemisphere, why not extend it to the rest of the world?<br />\nTo the objection that the entrance of the United States into a<br />\nLeague of Nations would be a violation of the American policy of<br />\npolitical isolation or of avoiding<br />\nentangling alliances, Dr. Latane<br />\nshows that this policy is quite distinct from the Monroe Doctrine<br />\nin principle. The policy was based<br />\non Washington's warning against<br />\npermanent alliances and Jefferson's against entangling alliances.<br />\nBoth apparently had in mind the<br />\nform of European alliance, which<br />\nwas frequently nothing more than<br />\na family compact between dynasties, and was usually at variance<br />\nwith the interests of the peoples<br />\naffected. In President Monroe's<br />\ndoctrine, however, the policy of<br />\nnon-interference in European internal affairs was promulgated \"as<br />\n<br />\n1919.<br />\n<br />\nHullahalao Will Rept e tent All Classes.<br />\n<br />\nThis year's Hullabaloo will differ radically from those which<br />\nhave preceded it. In the first<br />\nplace, it will be the University annual, and as such will represent<br />\nevery class. Every student activity, whether in athletic, literary,<br />\nmusical or dramatic lines, will be<br />\nrecorded, and any contribution, no<br />\nmatter to what class it pertains,<br />\nwill be accepted, if it reaches the<br />\nrequired standard. In other words,<br />\nthe Hullabaloo is no longer to be<br />\nsolely for the Senior Class, but is<br />\nto be the mirror of University life;<br />\nand, that this end may be obtained more readily,two associate<br />\nboards have been established, upon<br />\nwhich the lower classes are equally represented. These representatives will attend to the literary<br />\nwork and the business end of the<br />\nHullabaloo among their respective<br />\nclasses, and it is hoped that their<br />\nclassmates, by means of articles,<br />\nsnapshots and drawings, will help<br />\nthem to make this year's annual<br />\na complete record of. the activities of their class.<br />\nIn addition to having become a<br />\nUniversity annual, the Hullabaloo<br />\nis going to be out 012 time. Therefore, the write-ups and articles<br />\nmust be in by February 15, unless<br />\nthe editor-in-chief is notified and<br />\nauthorizes an additional delay.<br />\nThe group and individual pictures,<br />\nof which there will be an unusual<br />\nnumber this year, must be taken<br />\nwithin the specified time; and,<br />\ntherefore, if any group has failed<br />\nto make arrangements with Sonneborn for their sittings, they<br />\nshould do so at once. It would<br />\nalso greatly facilitate matters if<br />\nthe men of the various classes<br />\nould order and pay for their<br />\ncopies through their business repesentative as soon as possible.<br />\n<br />\nDR.

R.<br />\nMurphy, the new director of athletics, outlined his plans for the<br />\nComing seasons. He first asked<br />\nfor a full and hearty co-operation<br />\nof the students, for faith in his experience, and for toleration in<br />\nthose details that may not be entirely plain at the beginning.<br />\nThe speaker stated that he had<br />\nbeen a close observer of Hopkins<br />\nathletic matters for five years, and<br />\nhad arrived at the conclusion that<br />\nthe apparent lack of interest in<br />\nathletics of so many of the students is due to the lack of facilities. The question to be decided<br />\nis: Shall we stagnate and wait<br />\nfor these facilities, or shall we<br />\nforce -dip' across by a strong exhibition of interest?<br />\nThe faculty, he announced, is<br />\nready to help as much as lies in<br />\ns power. The students in the<br />\nvarious departments will be allowed to use the lockers for athletic purposes, and the showers as<br />\nwell. The big thing, he stated, to<br />\ndo now is to get going\u2014to complete the card registration and<br />\ntake a part.<br />\nMilitary experience in this war,<br />\ndeclared Mr. Murphy, has shown<br />\nthe moral obligation of every student to be physically fit, as well<br />\nas ready. For this reason alone<br />\nwe should all take some physical<br />\ntraining. This physical training<br />\nand the athletic activities will<br />\nboth be under a common head.<br />\nOne big drawback to universal<br />\nParticipation in athletics has been<br />\nuneven competition. A very small<br />\npercentage of the students, and<br />\nreally the ones who need the development the least, now get the<br />\nlion's share of the training and<br />\nSport. In the new system in<br />\nwhich inter-class contests will be<br />\na feature, the men will be divided<br />\ninto groups, according to their<br />\nathletic and physical development<br />\n. and ability. Those men who are<br />\nnot so highly developed physically\u2014and these are usually the ones<br />\nwho take no interest in things<br />\nathletic \u2014 will meet each other<br />\nin these contests without being over-shadowed by the \"star\"<br />\nathletes.

W. Hogue, the leader of<br />\nthe Sunday Open Forum. Dr.<br />\nHogue said that industrial democracy, a pressing problem of<br />\nthe day, was essential and that its<br />\nsolution was possible and, in fact,<br />\ninevitable. The great question is,<br />\nhe said, how will it be accomplished? Will it be through anarchy and revolution or can it be<br />\nevolved by peaceful means?<br />\nThe speaker quoted several<br />\nmagazine articles and editorials<br />\nwritten by members of the employing class, which pointed out that<br />\nthe time has come when workers<br />\nin all branches of industry must<br />\nno longer be treated as \"hands,\"<br />\nbut as human beings; when those<br />\nwho do the lowly work, as well as<br />\nthose who direct, must share in<br />\nthe proceeds of their labor instead<br />\nof merely being given \"wages\";<br />\nwhen there shall be legal compulsion for children to go to school<br />\nuntil a certain age, preventing<br />\ntheir childhood being burnt out in<br />\nthe forge of industry; when a sufficient wage is paid \"to enable<br />\nthe worker to maintain himself<br />\nand his family in health and honor, with such a margin of leisure<br />\nas will permit reasonable recreation and the development of mind<br />\nand spirit.\"<br />\nJohn D.

We now have<br />\nthe right type of coach, whom one<br />\nlive wire characterized as having<br />\n\"Inore life in him than ally one in<br />\nthe University.\" We needed a man<br />\n\\vim had at heart the future of<br />\nHopkins athletics and .the soundness- of our athletic policy,'rather<br />\nthan the turning out of a few State<br />\nchampionship teams,\u2014 one who<br />\nwould rather develop a team of<br />\nraw, but loyal, fighting workers<br />\nand an adequate squad of understudies as a nucleus for the following years, than coax out previously developed graduate students,<br />\nwho of necessity can give neither<br />\n-the time nor the spirit to practice.<br />\nWe needed, moreover, a man who<br />\nwas more interested in athletics<br />\nfor all, a means to the end of<br />\npermanently ,silccessful\u2022 'Varsity<br />\nteams, than in athletics merely for<br />\nthe favored few who need it least.<br />\nMr. Murphy bids fair perfectly<br />\nto fulfill these qualifications. For<br />\nfive years he has observed the Hopkins athletic policy, which h.as<br />\nbeen one of more or less haphazard<br />\nopportunism, especially in regard<br />\nto football. In past years, we<br />\nmade no provision for football future. We appealed to the Medical<br />\nSchool stars' loyalty, and they<br /><br />\nfiuially consented to play. Each<br />\nyear we hoped that enough readymade material would enter the<br />\nUniversity, but we made little attempt at preliminary training of<br />\n'Varsity material \u2014 the rounding<br />\nof the underclassmen into form.<br />\nThe past two seasons have<br />\nmarked a departure from that system. In 1917, there were only six<br />\ngraduates .on the football squad,<br />\nand never more than three of these<br />\nplayed in any one game; all of<br />\nthem came out solely because of<br />\ntheir loyalty and love of sport.<br />\nThe 1918 team was undergraduate<br />\non account of the S.

The<br />\nspring teams have in the past been<br />\nslightly more fortunate than the<br />\nfootball team in having a basis for<br />\nLast<br />\nperpetuating themselves.<br />\nyear's lacrosse team had no graduates, and the baseball team only<br />\ntwo; but we can easily recall the<br />\ntime when the baseball team<br />\nboasted comparatively few undergraduates. Thus, there has been<br />\nsome effort at amelioration.<br />\nThe vital question arises: Are<br />\nwe to revert to the old, lackadaisical system? Mr. Murphy's installation leaves no doubt as to the<br />\nanswer. We have his statement<br />\nthat, if the graduate is permitted<br />\nto play, he will have no special<br />\nprivileges, and must practice as<br />\nfaithfully as any other candidate.<br />\nMr. Murphy, moreover, intends to<br />\ndevote a great part of his attention to developing raw material,<br />\nwhich may not make the 'Varsity<br />\nfor two or three years, but which<br />\nwill at least insure trained squads<br />\nfor the following years. We will<br />\nnot then be left with the vague<br />\nhope that new, ready-developed<br />\nfootball players will choose Hopkins as their Alma Mater.<br />\nEven more than Coach Murphy's<br />\nsystem of preliminary training of<br />\n'Varsity material, we welcome his<br />\nPlan of un;versal athletic particiThe whole collegiate<br />\npation.<br />\nworld is undergoing a reaction<br />\nfrom the overspecialized, overorganized, commercialized intercollegiate athletics of several<br />\nyears ago,\u2014a reaction clearly<br />\n'llown in the last meeting of the<br />\nIntercollegiate Athletic Association in \"New York.

He has<br /><br />\nfound that the main factor in<br />\nkeeping many men from engaging<br />\nin athletics is uneven competition.<br />\nHe will attempt to solve this problem by dividing the student body<br />\ninto classes, according to their<br />\nathletic ability and experience,<br />\nand providing for intramural contests between those of like attainments.<br />\nOne obstacle to this plan is lack<br />\nof facilities, but this want will<br />\nbe filled when, by universal interest, we force it upon the attention of the University authorities.<br />\nThen we shall get our gym, our<br />\nHomewood cage, and our pool.<br />\nEven if all these'acquisitions are<br />\nnot made within our l'iliversity<br />\nEfe, we shall at least have laid<br />\nthe foundation for our student<br />\nposterity to buill upon.<br />\nThe issue is all-important to future Hopkins athletics.

It was shown that<br />\nsince our interference in behalf<br />\nof the peace and welfare of the<br />\nworld should not weaken our policy of protecting the independent<br />\nstates of this hemisphere, the establishment of this American principle as a world principle will<br />\nstrengthen the American principle.<br />\n\"The participation of the United States in a League of Nations<br />\nwould in a certain sense be a departure from the policy of isolation, but in a certain sense it<br />\nwould be an extension of that<br />\nprinciple also, for if we are to have<br />\na League of Nations, there must<br />\nbe no separate alliances between<br />\nthe different members of that<br />\nleague. * * * There will thus be<br />\nfreedom from entangling alliances<br />\nfor all the world.\"<br />\nStating that the policy of isolation was one that was possible a<br />\nhundred years ago, but not today, since we have already virtually disregarded that policy by our<br />\nentrance in the war, Dr. Latane<br />\nwrites:<br />\n\"We have been drawn into the<br />\nfull current of world politics and<br />\nwe must sink or swim with the<br />\nother nations of the world. Whatever international adjustments<br />\ntake place in the future we will<br />\nbe a party to them.\"<br />\nThe close union of Great Britain, France, Italy and the United<br />\nStates constitutes in reality a<br />\nLeague of Nations at present.<br />\nShall this be made permanent and<br />\nenlarged, or shall we fall back to<br />\nthe old system of alliances? The<br />\nonly possible way to avoid this,<br />\nit was stated, is to organize one<br />\ngreat league, including all the<br />\ngreat Powers and such of the lesser Powers as it may be deemed expedient to admit.<br />\nAs to the character of such a<br />\nleague, the writer believe that it<br />\ngi * * * should be a loose confederation, its central organ should<br />\nbe legislative and advisory, and<br />\nits main idea should be co-operation rather than coercion. What<br />\nis needed most is a channel for<br />\nthe focusing and expression of international public opinion. * * *<br />\n\" * * * I think that the most<br />\nwe can safely demand at present<br />\nis a proportional limitation of<br />\narmaments and that the policing<br />\nof the seas and disorderly countries will have to be done in most<br />\ncases by the fleet of the Power<br />\nmost vitally concerned in the<br />\nquarter of the globe which has to<br />\nbe policed. * * *<br />\n\" * * * But whatever form the<br />\nleague may take, its primary object is the protection of the weak<br />\nand the vindication of justice and<br />\nright. It is difficult to see how<br />\nany such league could be considered inconsistent with the Monroe Doctrine.\"<br /><br />\nDr. Latane Contributes Article to<br />\nWorld's Work Showing League not<br />\na Violation of Monroe Doctrine.<br /><br />\nIn a timely contribution to the<br />\nWorld's Work for February, entitled \"The League of Nations and<br />\nthe Monroe Doctrine,\" Dr. John<br />\nH. Latane shows that in entering<br />\na League of Nations, the United<br />\nStates would not be disregarding<br />\nthe Monroe Doctrine, but would<br />\nbe extending this principle to the<br />\nwhole world. Moreover, the entrance of the United States into<br />\nsuch a league would not be a violation of the American policy of<br />\nisolation, but in a sense would be<br />\nthe extension of that principle<br />\nalso to the nations of the world.<br />\nThe resolutions introduced recently by Senator Knox and Senator Borah indicate that, in the<br />\nminds of many, the Monroe Doctrine seems to be an obstacle to<br />\nthe entrance of the United States<br />\ninto a League of Nations. Dr.<br />\nLatane goes on to say:<br />\n\"The Monroe Doctrine was in<br />\nits origin nothing more than the<br />\nassertion, with special reference<br />\nto the American continents, of the<br />\nright of independent states to<br />\npursue their own careers without<br />\nfear or threat of intervention,<br />\ndomination or subjugation by<br />\nother states. * * * It will be seen<br />\nat once that this is the principle<br />\nfor which the Allies have been<br />\nfighting in this war, and when the<br />\n\u2022President called upon Congress to<br />\ndeclare war on Germany he said<br />\nthat we would fight 'for the rights<br />\nand liberties of small nations, for<br />\na universal domination or right by<br />\nsuch a concert of free peoples as<br />\nshall bring peace and safety to all<br />\nnations and make the world itself at last free.' No Senator<br />\nraised his voice in protest. * * *<br />\nWhy should United States Senators or anybody else think that in<br />\nextending this principle we are in<br />\nany way impairing it? If the<br />\nMonroe Doctrine is a sound principle and has been vindicated by<br />\nthe experience of a hundred years<br />\nin this hemisphere, why not extend it to the rest of the world?<br />\nTo the objection that the entrance of the United States into a<br />\nLeague of Nations would be a violation of the American policy of<br />\npolitical isolation or of avoiding<br />\nentangling alliances, Dr. Latane<br />\nshows that this policy is quite distinct from the Monroe Doctrine<br />\nin principle. The policy was based<br />\non Washington's warning against<br />\npermanent alliances and Jefferson's against entangling alliances.<br />\nBoth apparently had in mind the<br />\nform of European alliance, which<br />\nwas frequently nothing more than<br />\na family compact between dynasties, and was usually at variance<br />\nwith the interests of the peoples<br />\naffected. In President Monroe's<br />\ndoctrine, however, the policy of<br />\nnon-interference in European internal affairs was promulgated \"as<br /><br />\n1919.<br /><br />\nHullahalao Will Rept e tent All Classes.<br /><br />\nThis year's Hullabaloo will differ radically from those which<br />\nhave preceded it. In the first<br />\nplace, it will be the University annual, and as such will represent<br />\nevery class. Every student activity, whether in athletic, literary,<br />\nmusical or dramatic lines, will be<br />\nrecorded, and any contribution, no<br />\nmatter to what class it pertains,<br />\nwill be accepted, if it reaches the<br />\nrequired standard. In other words,<br />\nthe Hullabaloo is no longer to be<br />\nsolely for the Senior Class, but is<br />\nto be the mirror of University life;<br />\nand, that this end may be obtained more readily,two associate<br />\nboards have been established, upon<br />\nwhich the lower classes are equally represented. These representatives will attend to the literary<br />\nwork and the business end of the<br />\nHullabaloo among their respective<br />\nclasses, and it is hoped that their<br />\nclassmates, by means of articles,<br />\nsnapshots and drawings, will help<br />\nthem to make this year's annual<br />\na complete record of. the activities of their class.<br />\nIn addition to having become a<br />\nUniversity annual, the Hullabaloo<br />\nis going to be out 012 time. Therefore, the write-ups and articles<br />\nmust be in by February 15, unless<br />\nthe editor-in-chief is notified and<br />\nauthorizes an additional delay.<br />\nThe group and individual pictures,<br />\nof which there will be an unusual<br />\nnumber this year, must be taken<br />\nwithin the specified time; and,<br />\ntherefore, if any group has failed<br />\nto make arrangements with Sonneborn for their sittings, they<br />\nshould do so at once.
