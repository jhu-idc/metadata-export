In spite of the<br />\nshort notice given, the meeting<br />\nwas well attended, and was<br />\nmarked by announcements of<br />\ngeneral interest to Hopkins students.<br />\nHarris Kirk started things by<br />\nurging everyone to attend the<br />\ngame in the afternoon, and announced that there would be a<br />\nmass meeting every Friday, at 1<br />\no'clock, at which everyone was expected to be present\u2014no exceptions.<br />\nCoach Murphy then said that<br />\nhe wanted to see the Trench Mortarmen given a good reception at<br />\nHomewood Field. Charlie Leber<br />\nled some Hopkins songs and yells<br />\nwhich were delivered with the<br />\nsame old pep. Then a call for<br />\nvolunteers went forth \u2014 volunteers to carry in the 117th's<br />\nparade the banner announcing<br />\nthe game, and now it was that<br />\nour fine sense of modesty was<br />\ndisplayed. Call after call for<br />\ncourageous volunteers was made<br />\nbut still the bashful boys hung<br />\nback. It was even hinted that<br />\na selective service act would have<br />\nto be put into action and the required number drafted from the<br />\nfreshman. Finally four brave<br />\nyouths of '22 stood up and the<br />\ndanger was over.<br />\nThe meeting wound up with an<br />\ninteresting announcement by Mr.<br />\nMurphy.

At<br />\nthis meet teams from three Baltimore institutions won their<br />\nevents. This made an even better impression.

After<br />\nsonic discussion, Professor Julian<br />\nC. Smallwood, beloved by all of<br />\nthe engineering students, was<br />\nchosen.<br />\nThe election of the other four<br />\nmembers of the Hullabaloo board<br />\nwas postponed until the next<br />\nmeeting.<br />\n<br />\nAt the second meeting of the<br />\nSocial Science Club, Dr. Slonimsky spoke on the first of the subjects set by the club for discussion, namely, on \"The Indictment of the Present Social Order.\" His main contention was<br />\nthat the root cause of the evils<br />\nof society is not to be sought in<br />\nany one single wrong or defect,<br />\neconomic or political in character,<br />\nbut rather in the method underlying both, the basic method of<br />\nthe present social order. This<br />\nhe designated as the \"jungle<br />\nmethod,\" or the method of decision through superior force, and<br />\nhe pointed out that it is not<br />\nmerely inhuman' but enormously<br />\nwasteful.<br />\nDr. Slonimsky said in part:<br />\n\"The method by which society<br />\nlives is one taken over from a<br />\nlower plane of life. The method<br />\nof the jungle was fitted for the<br />\njungle, but on the human plane<br />\nit is an absurd and deadly survival, which must be replaced by<br />\nthe method of intelligent co-operation.\u2022 As long as we continue to<br />\nlive by it, nothing permanently<br />\nprogressive can be achieved. It<br />\ngives the lie to all our professions of religion, morality and<br />\ncivilization; and it cramps and<br />\ndistorts human nature, and nullifies its best endeavors. Thus, under the present system even the<br />\nmost well-intentioned capitalist,<br />\nthe most idealistic statesman, are<br />\ncondemned to futility. Should<br />\nthe young capitalist go too far<br />\nin his attempts to help his employees, he would be pushed to<br />\nthe wall by the ruthless competition of his next door neighbor.<br />\nShould the young statesman be<br />\nutterly free from imperialistic<br />\ngreed, should he be actuated by<br />\nnothing but pure love for his own<br />\ncountry, he would still be compelled by the logic of circumstances to urge adequate armament in self-defense, and thus<br />\nbring on militarism and all that<br />\nit implies. The effective morality<br />\nof individuals can hardly rise<br />\nhigher than that of the system in<br />\nwhich they live. Those who are<br />\nunwilling to work for a better<br />\norder rest their arguments upon<br />\n'human nature' and its inherent<br />\nselfishness and aggressiveness.<br />\nWar and poverty would accordingly be a part of the eternal<br />\nscheme of things. That is not<br />\nmerely a counsel of despair but<br />\nalso one of ignorance. In the<br />\nfirst place, human nature is quite<br />\nas much social and altruistic as<br />\nit is selfish and domineering;<br />\nonly that by our system we allow<br />\nthe latter to flourish and compel<br />\nthe former to wither. In the second place, human nature is not<br />\nthe hard and fast entity imagined; it is a bundle of possi-<br />\n<br />\nAT OTHER COLLEGES<br />\nDartmouth, Columbia a n d<br />\nPennsylvania will meet in a triangular track and field meet at<br />\nFranklin Field, Philadelphia, on<br />\nSaturday, May 17.

They returned to<br />\nBaltimore with a fair impression<br />\nof what twentieth century engineers are accomplishing. They<br />\nwill not soon forget the practical<br />\nobject lessons they learned from<br />\nseeing from first hand sources<br />\nsuch massive structures as were<br />\nshown them during their brief<br />\nstay on Monday and Tuesday,<br />\nApril 28 and 29.<br />\nThe party, which consisted of<br />\nProfessor J. H. Bringhurst, C. H.<br />\nBaxley, C. E. Keefer, C. W.<br />\nSchmidt, H. W. Taylor and J. K.<br />\nVickers, was met by Vice-Admiral<br />\nHarris, .one of our greatest authorities on port construction,<br />\nwho detailed Lieutenant Holliday<br />\nto conduct the party in his own<br />\nprivate speed boat.<br />\nThe first point of interest to<br />\nbe visited was Portsmouth, just<br />\nacross the Elizabeth river, opposite Norfolk. There they saw<br />\nstructures that many practicing<br />\nengineers have never had the op<br />\nportunity to see. The colossal<br />\n150 ton crane, the second largest<br />\nin the world, the largest dry dock<br />\nin the world, and the giant 2,000ton compressor, were inspected by<br />\nthe Hopkins men with great interest,<br />\nAt the army and the navy<br />\nbases they were equally recompensed with sights of worldwide interest. The permanent<br />\narmy base covers nine hundred<br />\nacres of land, has forty miles of<br />\nrailroad track and an equal<br />\namount of concrete roads. The<br />\nfreight facilities for bringing cars<br />\ninto the yards are highly efficient.<br />\nThe two famous piers, the largest<br />\nin the world, and the store houses<br />\n1,600 feet long, added to the collection of sights.<br />\nWhile on this tour of inspec<br />\ntion, the party saw a \"flock\" of<br />\nhydroplanes and one dirigible.<br />\nThe former host of planes performed all sorts of stunts and<br />\nwere an unexpected diversion to<br />\nthe visitors.<br />\nThe large rolling lift span of<br />\nthe bridge between Berkley and<br />\nNorfolk WaS of particularly instructive value.<br />\nOn Tuesday Professor Bringhurst and his men went to the<br />\nNewport News navy yard where<br />\nthe features of the 75-ton crane<br />\nwere explained to them. While<br />\nthey were there they went through<br />\nthe eleven large shipways where<br />\ntorpedo boat destroyers were<br />\nconstructed and saw by illustration how the floating gate functioned in the dry-docking of a<br />\nship.<br /><br />\nJohns Hopkins Press<br />\nI.\u2014American Journal of Mathematics.<br />\nF.

They<br />\nwere of the type that did all they<br />\ncould to hinder the nation's preparation for and conduct of the<br />\nwar; and now, taking advantage<br />\nof the reaction caused by cessation of hostilities, and too shortsighted to see any impending<br />\ndanger, they would render us defenseless.

Then a call for<br />\nvolunteers went forth \u2014 volunteers to carry in the 117th's<br />\nparade the banner announcing<br />\nthe game, and now it was that<br />\nour fine sense of modesty was<br />\ndisplayed. Call after call for<br />\ncourageous volunteers was made<br />\nbut still the bashful boys hung<br />\nback. It was even hinted that<br />\na selective service act would have<br />\nto be put into action and the required number drafted from the<br />\nfreshman. Finally four brave<br />\nyouths of '22 stood up and the<br />\ndanger was over.<br />\nThe meeting wound up with an<br />\ninteresting announcement by Mr.<br />\nMurphy. This was about the<br />\nUniversity's entrance into big<br />\nleague relations. During its<br />\nnorthern trip, the baseball team<br />\ndefeated Columbia, whose team<br />\nin turn trounced Princeton.<br />\nThis, of course, made a good<br />\nimpression on some of the larger<br />\nuniversities. Moreover, at the<br />\nPenn Relays in Philadelphia, the<br />\nJ. H. U. track men carried off a<br />\nbanner and broke a record. At<br />\nthis meet teams from three Baltimore institutions won their<br />\nevents. This made an even better impression. The Penn Relays are considered the most important track event of the year,<br />\nand the scoring of so signal a<br />\nsuccess gave everyone an oppor<br />\ntunity to realize that Baltimore<br />\nwas on the map. Next year<br />\nHoward will i come to Baltimore<br />\nto play Hopkins.<br /><br />\nHopkins.<br />\nA. B.

After<br />\nsonic discussion, Professor Julian<br />\nC. Smallwood, beloved by all of<br />\nthe engineering students, was<br />\nchosen.<br />\nThe election of the other four<br />\nmembers of the Hullabaloo board<br />\nwas postponed until the next<br />\nmeeting.<br /><br />\nAt the second meeting of the<br />\nSocial Science Club, Dr. Slonimsky spoke on the first of the subjects set by the club for discussion, namely, on \"The Indictment of the Present Social Order.\" His main contention was<br />\nthat the root cause of the evils<br />\nof society is not to be sought in<br />\nany one single wrong or defect,<br />\neconomic or political in character,<br />\nbut rather in the method underlying both, the basic method of<br />\nthe present social order. This<br />\nhe designated as the \"jungle<br />\nmethod,\" or the method of decision through superior force, and<br />\nhe pointed out that it is not<br />\nmerely inhuman' but enormously<br />\nwasteful.<br />\nDr. Slonimsky said in part:<br />\n\"The method by which society<br />\nlives is one taken over from a<br />\nlower plane of life. The method<br />\nof the jungle was fitted for the<br />\njungle, but on the human plane<br />\nit is an absurd and deadly survival, which must be replaced by<br />\nthe method of intelligent co-operation.\u2022 As long as we continue to<br />\nlive by it, nothing permanently<br />\nprogressive can be achieved. It<br />\ngives the lie to all our professions of religion, morality and<br />\ncivilization; and it cramps and<br />\ndistorts human nature, and nullifies its best endeavors. Thus, under the present system even the<br />\nmost well-intentioned capitalist,<br />\nthe most idealistic statesman, are<br />\ncondemned to futility. Should<br />\nthe young capitalist go too far<br />\nin his attempts to help his employees, he would be pushed to<br />\nthe wall by the ruthless competition of his next door neighbor.<br />\nShould the young statesman be<br />\nutterly free from imperialistic<br />\ngreed, should he be actuated by<br />\nnothing but pure love for his own<br />\ncountry, he would still be compelled by the logic of circumstances to urge adequate armament in self-defense, and thus<br />\nbring on militarism and all that<br />\nit implies. The effective morality<br />\nof individuals can hardly rise<br />\nhigher than that of the system in<br />\nwhich they live. Those who are<br />\nunwilling to work for a better<br />\norder rest their arguments upon<br />\n'human nature' and its inherent<br />\nselfishness and aggressiveness.<br />\nWar and poverty would accordingly be a part of the eternal<br />\nscheme of things. That is not<br />\nmerely a counsel of despair but<br />\nalso one of ignorance. In the<br />\nfirst place, human nature is quite<br />\nas much social and altruistic as<br />\nit is selfish and domineering;<br />\nonly that by our system we allow<br />\nthe latter to flourish and compel<br />\nthe former to wither. In the second place, human nature is not<br />\nthe hard and fast entity imagined; it is a bundle of possi-<br /><br />\nAT OTHER COLLEGES<br />\nDartmouth, Columbia a n d<br />\nPennsylvania will meet in a triangular track and field meet at<br />\nFranklin Field, Philadelphia, on<br />\nSaturday, May 17.
