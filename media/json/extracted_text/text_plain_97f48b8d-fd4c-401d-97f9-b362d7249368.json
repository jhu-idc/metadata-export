Approximately 500 sales<br />\nwere investigated and in each case an interview was conducted with both<br />\nthe seller and the buyer.

Most of the houses were at the same<br />\nlevel as the expressway or at a lower level.<br />\n<br />\nThe results of the study showed that the sales prices for houses<br />\nadjoining the expressway were approximately 1% to 29% lower than the<br />\nhouses away from the expressway. This difference is hardly large enough<br />\nto be significant. In the course of the interviews 429, of the residents<br />\nliving adjacent to expressways indicated that the noise did not bother<br />\nthem, 339 were recorded as having \u201cslight objection,\u201d and 109 stated<br />\nthat they were bothered only by trucks. The remaining 159% found the<br />\nnoise objectionable.
