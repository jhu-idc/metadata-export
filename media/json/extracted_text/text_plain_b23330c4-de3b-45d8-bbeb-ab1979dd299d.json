The<br />\nproposed 1974 budget stands at<br />\n$105 million, up from $95<br />\nmillion in 1973.<br />\nThe federal funds were<br />\npreviously granted to the<br />\nUniversity under the terms of the<br />\nHill-Rhodes Act, which provided<br />\ngrants to schools of public health<br />\nbut have been eliminated by the<br />\nNixon Administration in next<br />\nyear's federal budget, now before<br />\nCongress. Hopkins received<br />\n$462,000 from the program in<br />\nfiscal 1973.<br />\n\"Because the 1974 budget was<br />\nprepared before we knew the<br />\nHill-Rhodes was eliminated,<br />\nwe're confronted with a minor<br />\ncrisis,\" commented Vice<br />\n<br />\nPresident for Business<br />\nManagement Robert C.

Hume and<br />\nhis staff are now attempting to<br />\nmake some cutbacks and to find<br />\nalternative sources of funds to<br />\nmake up for the anticipated<br />\nreduction. One key administrator<br />\nnoted that Hygiene had the<br />\n<br />\ngreatest problems of any<br />\nUniversity Division in balancing<br />\nits 1974 budget.<br />\n\"They had to count on getting<br />\nthe Hill-Rhodes money to<br />\nbalance their budget,\" he noted.<br />\nDown<br />\nIn another federal cutback,<br />\nHopkins will receive<br />\napproximately $330,000 in<br />\nBiomedical Research Support<br />\ngrants in 1974, down from the<br />\napproximately $1 million<br />\n<br />\nreceived in 1973.<br />\nWhile these funds support only<br />\nresearch contracts, their<br />\nelimination may result in pressure<br />\nto put young faculty supported<br />\nby contracts on the general<br />\nUniversity budget, one<br />\nadministrator noted.

It did not begin<br />\noperations until March 15, six<br />\nweeks late, under the temporary<br />\ndirection of financial aid staffer<br />\nMary Bradshaw.<br />\nRiina stated that he hopes to<br />\nreclaim the Employment Service<br />\nometime this summer, probably<br />\nin May. \"Right now, I'm so busy<br />\nwith admitting the freshman class<br />\nthat I don't have time for<br />\nanything else,\" he said<br />\nRead is scheduled to begin<br />\nwork with the, Service Monday,<br />\nbut may instead spend one day<br />\ninstructing her possible<br />\n<br />\nsuccessor , whom Riina hired last<br />\nweek, during Read's vacation.<br />\nRiina expressed confidence in<br />\nRead's replacement. \"She<br />\nworked in the Office of Financial<br />\nAid at the University of<br />\nChicago,\" Riina said, where<br />\nshe worked as a clerk-typist.<br />\nRana stated she will require<br />\ntime to adjust to procedures<br />\nwhich have changed since she last<br />\nworked in financial aid.<br />\nThe financial aid awards for<br />\nreturning undergraduates will not<br />\nbe made until June or July,<br />\naccording to Riina. He attributed<br />\nthis delay to uncertainty over<br />\nfederal funding.<br />\nCommenting last night on the<br />\nnew woman in his office, Riina<br />\nindicated that she has not yet<br />\nbeen named as Read's successor.<br />\n<br />\n\"I only hope that the burden<br />\nof financial aid does not fall to<br />\nJohn Riina,\" he added.<br />\nRiina is also in charge of<br />\nfinancial aid, though his staff<br />\nincludes Kenneth Johnson,<br />\nAssistant Director of Financial<br />\nAid.<br />\nMost administrators in contact<br />\nwith Riina's operations admit<br />\nthat his office is saddled with<br />\nnumerous difficulties. Dr. George<br />\nS. Benton, Vice-President for<br />\nHomewood, and Riina's<br />\nadministrative superior, has<br />\ndispatched his assistant Larry<br />\nDenton, and a secretary, to assist<br />\nRiina in financial aid work. They<br />\nhave been working with Riina for<br />\napproximately three weeks.<br />\nRiina and Denton reportedly<br />\ncollaborated in the development<br />\n<br />\ninto account.\"<br />\nThe guidelines correlate the<br />\napplicant's numerical valuation,<br />\nas determined by the admissions<br />\nprocedure, with the percentage<br />\nof the applicant's financial need<br />\nwhich will be awarded by the<br />\nUniversity. Each applicant is<br />\nrated on a scale from one to five,<br />\nRiina stated.<br />\nThe guidelines were<br />\ndistributed to members of the<br />\nadmissions and financial aid staff.<br />\nEach photostated copy was<br />\nnumbered and marked, in capital<br />\nletters, \"CONFIDENTIAL.\"<br />\nThis represents the second<br />\ntime in two weeks that Riina has<br />\nrequested that financial aid<br />\ninformation be kept confidential.<br />\nAn office memo dated March<br />\n21, 1973, and distributed to<br />\nM-At<br />\n<br />\nDATI<br />\nSUBJECT<br />\n<br />\nThe nature of Financial Aid information requires confidentiality.<br />\nTherefore, information for release must have my approval.

Riina then drove through<br />\nthe Sunday evening rain, to<br />\npersonally offer Read the<br />\nEmployment Service position. \"I<br />\nthink this is a very good move,\"<br />\nRiina said.<br />\nStudent Council President<br />\nAndrew W. Savitz commented,\"I<br />\nthink Ruth Read will do a great<br />\njob on the Student Employment<br />\nService.<br />\n<br />\nof a set of objective guidelines<br />\nfor the awarding of financial aid<br />\nto accepted applicants. Riina<br />\nstressed the flexibility of these<br />\nguidelines, and their application<br />\nto the individual applicants.<br />\n\"There are a number of<br />\nconsiderations which we take<br />\ninto account,\" Riina said. \"Each<br />\napplicant must be considered<br />\nindividually,\" he added.<br />\nAnother source, however,<br />\nstated, \"I've never seen anything<br />\nlike this.

We're<br />\ninterested in the broader<br />\nconsiderations -- the class profile,<br />\nthe mix, the quality of the class.\"<br />\nDenton went on to say that he<br />\nwas never involved in actual<br />\nfinancial aid awards. \"I've never<br />\nread an admissions folder,\" he<br />\nremarked. \"I'm not sure of all<br />\nthe details.\"<br />\nRiina, however, stated,\"I used<br />\nLarry as a financial aid officer<br />\nwhile Ruth was on vacation. He<br />\nwas involved with a number of<br />\nactivities.\"<br />\nDespite the difficulties in his<br />\noffice's operations, Riina<br />\nexpressed confidence that<br />\ntoday's deadline for mailing<br />\nletters of notification to<br />\napplicants, would be met.<br />\nTelephone calls to the<br />\nAdmissions office last night and<br />\nWednesday evening indicated<br />\nsignificant late-night work.<br />\nLast night at 9:05 p.m., Riina,<br />\nwhen asked about the status of<br />\nadmissions decisions,<br />\ncommented, \"We're just about<br />\nthere.\" When asked about<br />\nfinancial aid awards, he repeated,<br />\n\"We're just about there.\"<br />\nBoth Wednesday afternoon<br />\nand last night, Riina refused to<br />\nstate how many applicants will<br />\nbe admitted, the number who<br />\nwill receive financial aid, and the<br />\nnumber of accepted students by<br />\nsex, race, and academic area.<br />\n\"Well, we don't exactly know<br />\nyet,\" he said last night. \"This will<br />\nrequire some computer runs, and<br />\nI don't know just when we'll<br />\nhave exact data.

The<br />\nproposed 1974 budget stands at<br />\n$105 million, up from $95<br />\nmillion in 1973.<br />\nThe federal funds were<br />\npreviously granted to the<br />\nUniversity under the terms of the<br />\nHill-Rhodes Act, which provided<br />\ngrants to schools of public health<br />\nbut have been eliminated by the<br />\nNixon Administration in next<br />\nyear's federal budget, now before<br />\nCongress. Hopkins received<br />\n$462,000 from the program in<br />\nfiscal 1973.<br />\n\"Because the 1974 budget was<br />\nprepared before we knew the<br />\nHill-Rhodes was eliminated,<br />\nwe're confronted with a minor<br />\ncrisis,\" commented Vice<br /><br />\nPresident for Business<br />\nManagement Robert C. Bowie.<br />\nMuller is to present the budget to<br />\nthe Trustees at their April 16<br />\nmeeting.<br />\nAccording to Bowie, Hygiene<br />\nSchool Dean John C. Hume and<br />\nhis staff are now attempting to<br />\nmake some cutbacks and to find<br />\nalternative sources of funds to<br />\nmake up for the anticipated<br />\nreduction. One key administrator<br />\nnoted that Hygiene had the<br /><br />\ngreatest problems of any<br />\nUniversity Division in balancing<br />\nits 1974 budget.<br />\n\"They had to count on getting<br />\nthe Hill-Rhodes money to<br />\nbalance their budget,\" he noted.<br />\nDown<br />\nIn another federal cutback,<br />\nHopkins will receive<br />\napproximately $330,000 in<br />\nBiomedical Research Support<br />\ngrants in 1974, down from the<br />\napproximately $1 million<br /><br />\nreceived in 1973.<br />\nWhile these funds support only<br />\nresearch contracts, their<br />\nelimination may result in pressure<br />\nto put young faculty supported<br />\nby contracts on the general<br />\nUniversity budget, one<br />\nadministrator noted. The bulk of<br />\nthese funds have been channeled<br />\nto the Medical Institutions.

Wednesday,<br />\nApril 4.<br />\nTroung, whose father. Troung<br />\nDinh Dzu, was arrested shortly<br />\nafter South Vietnam's<br />\npresidential election of 1967, in<br />\nwhich he was runner-up to<br />\nNguyen Van Thieu, stressed the<br />\nfact that the Thieu regime has<br />\nfollowed a policy of political<br />\nrepression of all dissenters since<br />\n1967.<br />\n\"The Thieu regime is presently<br />\nholding more than 200,000<br />\npolitical prisoners in its U.S.<br /><br />\nfinanced prisons. Many of these<br />\nprisoners represent popular urban<br />\nelements in South Vietnam. whose<br />\nactions and political views have<br />\nnot been identified with either<br />\nthe P.R.G. or the Thieu regime -known as neutralists,- stated<br />\nTroung.<br />\nTroung added that those<br />\nimprisoned come from a broad<br />\nspectrum of South Vietnamese<br />\nsociety. \"They include high<br />\nschool and college students.<br />\npacifist Buddhists.

COHEN<br />\nFinancial Aid Officer Ruth<br />\nRead was named Director of the<br />\new Student Employment<br />\nService early this week, in what<br />\nkey administrators see as the first<br />\nin a series of moves to reorganize<br />\nthe Office of Admissions and<br />\nFinancial Aid headed by John R.<br />\nRiina.<br />\nAs Director of the Service,<br />\nRead will move into the<br />\nPersonnel Office headed by J.<br />\nLyon Rogers.<br />\nAlthough slated to get<br />\nunderway February 1, the<br />\nService has met with numerous<br />\ndelays.<br />\n6 Weeks Late<br />\nAfter Ruby Harris turned<br />\ndown the directorship of the<br />\nService to accept an Evening<br />\nCollege position January 29, the<br />\nproposed Service was shifted<br />\nfrom Riina's<br />\noffice into<br />\nPersonnel. It did not begin<br />\noperations until March 15, six<br />\nweeks late, under the temporary<br />\ndirection of financial aid staffer<br />\nMary Bradshaw.<br />\nRiina stated that he hopes to<br />\nreclaim the Employment Service<br />\nometime this summer, probably<br />\nin May. \"Right now, I'm so busy<br />\nwith admitting the freshman class<br />\nthat I don't have time for<br />\nanything else,\" he said<br />\nRead is scheduled to begin<br />\nwork with the, Service Monday,<br />\nbut may instead spend one day<br />\ninstructing her possible<br /><br />\nsuccessor , whom Riina hired last<br />\nweek, during Read's vacation.<br />\nRiina expressed confidence in<br />\nRead's replacement. \"She<br />\nworked in the Office of Financial<br />\nAid at the University of<br />\nChicago,\" Riina said, where<br />\nshe worked as a clerk-typist.<br />\nRana stated she will require<br />\ntime to adjust to procedures<br />\nwhich have changed since she last<br />\nworked in financial aid.<br />\nThe financial aid awards for<br />\nreturning undergraduates will not<br />\nbe made until June or July,<br />\naccording to Riina. He attributed<br />\nthis delay to uncertainty over<br />\nfederal funding.<br />\nCommenting last night on the<br />\nnew woman in his office, Riina<br />\nindicated that she has not yet<br />\nbeen named as Read's successor.<br /><br />\n\"I only hope that the burden<br />\nof financial aid does not fall to<br />\nJohn Riina,\" he added.<br />\nRiina is also in charge of<br />\nfinancial aid, though his staff<br />\nincludes Kenneth Johnson,<br />\nAssistant Director of Financial<br />\nAid.<br />\nMost administrators in contact<br />\nwith Riina's operations admit<br />\nthat his office is saddled with<br />\nnumerous difficulties. Dr. George<br />\nS. Benton, Vice-President for<br />\nHomewood, and Riina's<br />\nadministrative superior, has<br />\ndispatched his assistant Larry<br />\nDenton, and a secretary, to assist<br />\nRiina in financial aid work.

We're<br />\ninterested in the broader<br />\nconsiderations -- the class profile,<br />\nthe mix, the quality of the class.\"<br />\nDenton went on to say that he<br />\nwas never involved in actual<br />\nfinancial aid awards. \"I've never<br />\nread an admissions folder,\" he<br />\nremarked. \"I'm not sure of all<br />\nthe details.\"<br />\nRiina, however, stated,\"I used<br />\nLarry as a financial aid officer<br />\nwhile Ruth was on vacation.
