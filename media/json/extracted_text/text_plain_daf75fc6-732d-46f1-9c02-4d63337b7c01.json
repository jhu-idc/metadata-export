It was estimated that the hardest years of<br />\neach graduate would be the first<br />\nfew to come, and that after this<br />\npreliminary period the tangible<br />\nresults of a college education<br />\nwould have begun to show themselves in the form of an increased<br />\nearning capacity. In this way, it<br />\nwas figured, a man will probably<br />\nbe in a much better position to<br />\npay his last installment of fortyfour dollars at the end of the<br />\ntwentieth year than he would be<br />\nto pay the twenty-five dollar installment next year, which would<br />\nbe necessitated if the payments<br />\nwere not graded.<br />\nEvery effort is being made by<br />\nthe committee to have the pledges<br />\nsigned by the members of the<br />\nclass as soon as possible, as many<br />\nof the seniors expect to leave for<br />\nthe officers' training camp within<br />\nthe next week.<br />\nThe plan, in its final form, has<br />\nmet with the hearty approval of<br />\nProfessors Hollander a ml Barnett, of the political economy department, as the one which, all<br />\nthings considered, has the best<br />\nchance of success.

Whether<br />\nthe particular individ ft al concerned finds that te is ineligible<br />\nfor active service or not at the<br />\npresent time, nevertheless the<br />\npreparation which the corps affords is bound to stand him in<br />\ngood stead when his time arrives<br />\n\u2014besides which there is involved<br />\nthe very much more important<br />\nfactor of fulfilling a tacit pledge.<br />\nTHE NEWS - LETTER does not<br />\nagree with its vehement correspondent in this week's Mail Bag,<br />\nwho claims that the activities of<br />\nthe corps should almost entirely<br />\nsupplant the regular University<br />\ncurriculum. The drill provided is<br />\nneither onerous enough for such<br />\naction, nor would the University<br />\nbe best serving its country by pursuing such a course. With only<br />\nthree drills a week, however, no<br />\nman can take refuge for his nonattendance behind the claim that<br />\nhis studies prevent hint from carrying on his military training.<br />\nThis week, with three Hopkins<br />\nmen sailing for France, Hopkins<br />\nagain proves the depth of the patriotism of its students. What<br />\n'those who remain behind,and who,<br />\nat the present time, foresee no way<br />\n<br />\nin which they may enter actual<br />\nservice, must realize, is that they<br />\ncan manifest their patriotism<br />\nvery effectually by helping in the<br />\ndevelopment of the Hopkins Corps.<br />\nThe Musical Clubs.<br />\n<br />\nThe Johns Hopkins Musical<br />\nClubs never quite receive the apr<br />\npreciation from the University<br />\nwhich should be theirs by right.<br />\nIn other institutions, where the<br />\nquality of the concerts given is<br />\nnot a whit better than those which<br />\nthe Hopkins musicians produce,<br />\nsupport of the 'varsity clubs is<br />\nlooked upon by the students and<br />\nalumni from the same viewpoint<br />\nas is the support of the athletic<br />\nteams; but at Hopkins that support is very seldom forthcoming<br />\nin anything like the degree deserved.<br />\nApart from the very definite<br />\npart in the creation of what small<br />\n\"college life\" there has existed at<br />\nHopkins in the past, the clubs for<br />\nseveral years have consistently<br />\nbrought the University before the<br />\npublic eye throughout the city<br />\nand State. That the advertising<br />\nfunction which the organization<br />\nable to fulfill_should be as limited as it is, goes back to the obvious fact that Hopkins as yet is<br />\nnot as fortunate in the number<br />\nof its alumni scattered about the<br />\ncountry as are other universities.<br />\nNevertheless, even when this fact<br />\nhas been taken into consideration,<br />\nneither alumni nor students at<br />\nHopkins have accorded the clubs<br />\nthe support which they deserve.<br />\nThe season which the clubs have<br />\njust brought to a close repre-s<br />\nsents a protracted period of<br />\nsteady, and often tiring, work performed by every member of the<br />\norganization \u2014performed without<br />\nthe official recognition which the<br />\nUniversity accords to other student services. Not only have the<br />\nclubs of the past few years succeeded in producing concerts which<br />\ncompare not unfavorably with the<br />\nconcerts ,of any university of similar size in the country, and even<br />\nwith the work of the musicians<br />\nof larger institutions; but, entirely under student direction, they<br />\nhave succeeded in putting themselves upon a solid financial basis<br />\nwhich, in itself, when natural handicaps are considered, represents<br />\nquite an achievement.<br />\nCertainly the members of the<br />\nclubs during the past season are<br />\nas much to be congratulated upon<br />\ntheir work as are the members of<br />\nany other student activity.<br />\n<br />\nHOPKINS MEN OFF FOR FRANCE<br />\n<br />\nsioned grades when the new regiments are formed.<br />\n(Continued from page I)<br />\n\"A student who 'cuts' a drill<br />\nrequirements are perfect health, from now on,\" said the lieutenant,<br />\ntwenty-one years of age, good \"is showing a lack of patriotism<br />\nmoral character and United States and good sense which is not in<br />\ncitizenship.

It was estimated that the hardest years of<br />\neach graduate would be the first<br />\nfew to come, and that after this<br />\npreliminary period the tangible<br />\nresults of a college education<br />\nwould have begun to show themselves in the form of an increased<br />\nearning capacity. In this way, it<br />\nwas figured, a man will probably<br />\nbe in a much better position to<br />\npay his last installment of fortyfour dollars at the end of the<br />\ntwentieth year than he would be<br />\nto pay the twenty-five dollar installment next year, which would<br />\nbe necessitated if the payments<br />\nwere not graded.<br />\nEvery effort is being made by<br />\nthe committee to have the pledges<br />\nsigned by the members of the<br />\nclass as soon as possible, as many<br />\nof the seniors expect to leave for<br />\nthe officers' training camp within<br />\nthe next week.<br />\nThe plan, in its final form, has<br />\nmet with the hearty approval of<br />\nProfessors Hollander a ml Barnett, of the political economy department, as the one which, all<br />\nthings considered, has the best<br />\nchance of success.

Beyond that intention, we have not<br />\nbeen able to go because we have<br />\nnot been able to learn just what<br />\nCongress will do with our legislation.

Whether<br />\nthe particular individ ft al concerned finds that te is ineligible<br />\nfor active service or not at the<br />\npresent time, nevertheless the<br />\npreparation which the corps affords is bound to stand him in<br />\ngood stead when his time arrives<br />\n\u2014besides which there is involved<br />\nthe very much more important<br />\nfactor of fulfilling a tacit pledge.<br />\nTHE NEWS - LETTER does not<br />\nagree with its vehement correspondent in this week's Mail Bag,<br />\nwho claims that the activities of<br />\nthe corps should almost entirely<br />\nsupplant the regular University<br />\ncurriculum. The drill provided is<br />\nneither onerous enough for such<br />\naction, nor would the University<br />\nbe best serving its country by pursuing such a course. With only<br />\nthree drills a week, however, no<br />\nman can take refuge for his nonattendance behind the claim that<br />\nhis studies prevent hint from carrying on his military training.<br />\nThis week, with three Hopkins<br />\nmen sailing for France, Hopkins<br />\nagain proves the depth of the patriotism of its students. What<br />\n'those who remain behind,and who,<br />\nat the present time, foresee no way<br /><br />\nin which they may enter actual<br />\nservice, must realize, is that they<br />\ncan manifest their patriotism<br />\nvery effectually by helping in the<br />\ndevelopment of the Hopkins Corps.<br />\nThe Musical Clubs.<br /><br />\nThe Johns Hopkins Musical<br />\nClubs never quite receive the apr<br />\npreciation from the University<br />\nwhich should be theirs by right.<br />\nIn other institutions, where the<br />\nquality of the concerts given is<br />\nnot a whit better than those which<br />\nthe Hopkins musicians produce,<br />\nsupport of the 'varsity clubs is<br />\nlooked upon by the students and<br />\nalumni from the same viewpoint<br />\nas is the support of the athletic<br />\nteams; but at Hopkins that support is very seldom forthcoming<br />\nin anything like the degree deserved.<br />\nApart from the very definite<br />\npart in the creation of what small<br />\n\"college life\" there has existed at<br />\nHopkins in the past, the clubs for<br />\nseveral years have consistently<br />\nbrought the University before the<br />\npublic eye throughout the city<br />\nand State. That the advertising<br />\nfunction which the organization<br />\nable to fulfill_should be as limited as it is, goes back to the obvious fact that Hopkins as yet is<br />\nnot as fortunate in the number<br />\nof its alumni scattered about the<br />\ncountry as are other universities.<br />\nNevertheless, even when this fact<br />\nhas been taken into consideration,<br />\nneither alumni nor students at<br />\nHopkins have accorded the clubs<br />\nthe support which they deserve.<br />\nThe season which the clubs have<br />\njust brought to a close repre-s<br />\nsents a protracted period of<br />\nsteady, and often tiring, work performed by every member of the<br />\norganization \u2014performed without<br />\nthe official recognition which the<br />\nUniversity accords to other student services. Not only have the<br />\nclubs of the past few years succeeded in producing concerts which<br />\ncompare not unfavorably with the<br />\nconcerts ,of any university of similar size in the country, and even<br />\nwith the work of the musicians<br />\nof larger institutions; but, entirely under student direction, they<br />\nhave succeeded in putting themselves upon a solid financial basis<br />\nwhich, in itself, when natural handicaps are considered, represents<br />\nquite an achievement.<br />\nCertainly the members of the<br />\nclubs during the past season are<br />\nas much to be congratulated upon<br />\ntheir work as are the members of<br />\nany other student activity.<br /><br />\nHOPKINS MEN OFF FOR FRANCE<br /><br />\nsioned grades when the new regiments are formed.<br />\n(Continued from page I)<br />\n\"A student who 'cuts' a drill<br />\nrequirements are perfect health, from now on,\" said the lieutenant,<br />\ntwenty-one years of age, good \"is showing a lack of patriotism<br />\nmoral character and United States and good sense which is not in<br />\ncitizenship.
