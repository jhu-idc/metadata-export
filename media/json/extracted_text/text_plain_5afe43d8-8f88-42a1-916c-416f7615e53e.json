This assessment, however, is not entirely correct. While<br />\nthe Office has sponsored numerous activities<br />\nassociated with political and social groups<br />\nand also has virtually ignored religion on this<br />\ncampus, it has accomplished a great deal for<br />\nthe community.<br />\nWith the departure of Chester Wickwire<br />\nas University Chaplain, several questions<br />\nabout his office's purpose must be asked.<br />\nWill the new chaplain be more involved<br />\nwith religion on the Homewood campus?<br />\nWhile the Jewish Students Association<br />\norganizes services every weekend, the current Chaplain's Office, instead, presents the<br />\nSunday Experience which seldom deals with<br />\nreligion. Recent topics have included \"Continuing Issues in the 80s,\" \"The Reader's<br />\nDigest and 60 Minutes vs. The National and<br />\nWorld Councils of Church,\" and various<br />\nfilms, such as \"Judgment at Nuremberg.\"<br />\nWill the programs currently run by the<br />\nChaplain's Office continue?<br />\nAssociate Dean of Students Chris Colombo has said that the Weekend Wonder Flix,<br />\nthe Reel World, and the Bijou film series,<br />\nthe Student Handbook, and Chester's Place<br />\nwill be under the auspices of Student Activities Director Mary Ellen Porter, who<br />\nworked in the Office for two years during<br />\nthe late 70s.<br />\nWhile students should continue to operate<br />\nthe film series, someone must volunteer his<br />\n<br />\nservices or be hired by the University to run<br />\nChester's Place, as was the case when the<br />\npopular Wednesday nightspot was under the<br />\nChaplain's Office. Porter has too many<br />\nother responsibilities.<br />\nWhile the film series and Chester's Place<br />\nshould continue because they benefit<br />\nstudents, the Student Handbook should no<br />\nlonger exist, unless it is totally redesigned.<br />\nCurrently, few people read it or simply don't<br />\nknow about it.<br />\nWhat will happen to the Tutorial Project<br />\nand the Sunday Experience? Supposedly, the<br />\nnew Chaplain's Office will continue to offer them. The Tutorial Project should continue, for it's the only tangible University activity which benefits the community. Someone must take on that responsibility, and<br />\nit might as well be the University Chaplain.<br />\nAs for the Sunday Experience, it also<br />\nshould continue, but its function must<br />\nchange. Students should be given the option<br />\nto attend ecumenical services on the college campus. Why should Hopkins be different from most other universities?<br />\nThe Sunday Experience and other<br />\nChaplain Office-sponsored events should not<br />\nbe used as social or political forums. The<br />\nChaplain, a University employee, should not<br />\npublicly voice his opinions on Central<br />\nAmerica and the Middle East because people may assume that the University supports<br />\nhis views.<br />\nBefore Wickwire's replacement is selected,<br />\nthe role of University Chaplain must be better defined.<br />\n<br />\nLetters<br />\nBreach of Contract<br />\nTo the Editor:<br />\nBecause the election of class<br />\nofficers is on such a small scale,<br />\nthe issue of personal ethics rarely enters the political arena.<br />\nBut, unfortunately, this was not<br />\nthe case in this past week's election for senior class president.<br />\nIn the past race for student<br />\ncouncil president, Joe Attar approached me with a request to<br />\ndraw a poster on his behalf. I<br />\nobliged without much thought<br />\nor consideration of Joe as a<br />\ncandidate. Upon his defeat,<br />\nhowever, I forgot about the<br />\nposters and the incident.<br />\nRecently, Joe approached me<br />\nagain with a request for more<br />\nposters, this time for senior<br />\nclass president but I couldn't<br />\nbecause of other commitments.<br />\nJoe was persistent and even<br />\nresorted to offering me various<br />\nfuture enticements if he obtained office. Still, I had to decline.<br />\nI did not see Joe for the next<br />\nfew days, until he came and<br />\ntold me that he had doctored<br />\nmy original posters and had<br />\nalready printed them without<br />\ngetting my permission. I was<br />\nnot pleased with this, but at<br />\nthat point, there was nothing I<br />\ncould do.<br />\nWith his gaining a spot in the<br />\nrun-off election, however, I feel<br />\nit necessary to point out his<br />\n<br />\nbreach of trust displayed by the<br />\nman who hopes to be a class<br />\nleader. In no way do I support<br />\nJoe Attar or any other candidate for political office<br />\nbeyond the casting of my personal vote, and I offer this letter as a disclaimer to my posters<br />\nand to whatever they may imply about my opinions.<br />\nEvan Krakovitz<br />\n<br />\nPolitical Coverage<br />\nTo the Editor:<br />\n<br />\ntative for the Class of '86.

It's only<br />\nfair to announce the candidates<br />\nwho are seeking office,<br />\nespecially when their names appear on the official ballot.<br />\nI'm certain that this failure to<br />\nprint Kevin's name in last<br />\nweek's News-Letter was a gross<br />\noversight, and I'm sure that the<br />\nNews-Letter will print an<br />\napology to its readers, in keeping with its policy of fairness<br />\nand equal time to all<br />\ncandidates.<br />\nI only wish that the election<br />\ncommittee follows the same<br />\npractice. It seems that after seeing Kevin's name on his petition and on his candidate's<br />\nstatement, it still chose to spell<br />\nit incorrectly. It is spelled TULLY, not Tulley. I hope that this<br />\nwill be corrected before Tuesday's run-off election.<br />\n<br />\nYou cannot pick up an issue<br />\nof the News-Letter without<br />\nreading about campus politics.<br />\nThis, however, has gotten out<br />\nof hand. When the News-Letter<br />\nattacked Maureen Freed, I let<br />\nthis pass because elected officials are subject to such public<br />\nscrutiny, especially by the press.<br />\nBut when the News-Letter<br />\nstarts endorsing candidates for<br />\nstudent office, you have to<br />\nwonder. I'm sure Jon Lana did<br />\nnot pay money for an advertisement describing his political<br />\naspirations, and yet the NewsLetter endorsed his candidacy<br />\nover Joe Attar for student<br />\ncouncil president.

Therefore, I would like<br />\nto see a joint effort made by the<br />\nOffice of Advising and<br />\nCounseling and the individual<br />\nprofessors when the decision<br />\nconcerning how much work the<br />\ngrieving student is able to complete is made. The bottom line<br />\nof this decision, however, must<br />\nbe an awareness that all individuals experience grief differently. If a student is not able<br />\nto handle what a particular professor might consider a reasonable workload, then the Office<br />\nof Advising and Counseling<br />\nshould be able to pursue the<br />\nmatter further as the student's<br />\nadvocate.<br />\nAdditionally, there is one<br />\npoint in Joff Masukawa's letter that disturbed me.

But how<br />\nmany of us who got an extension realized the \"supportive\"ness and \"cooperative' -ness of<br />\nMary Brune and others in the<br />\noffice when we were the ones<br />\nwho were short on cooperation?<br />\nI sincerely believe that people<br />\nwho are unhappy with their experiences in any office of this<br />\nuniversity should voice their<br />\ngrievances. Letters about Advising and Counseling, the<br />\nHousing Office, and other student services can lead to an improved situation for us. But I<br />\nthink that those of us who are<br />\nexperiencing something positive<br />\nevery once in a while also<br />\nshould say something.

There are several<br />\nhundred Galapagos Islands and<br />\nall are about 600 miles off the<br />\nSouth American coast. Over<br />\nthree-fourths are uninhabited<br />\nand are part of an Ecuadorian<br />\nnational park.<br />\nLast Friday, Dr. Gordon<br />\nOrians, a full professor of<br />\nzoology and director of the Institute of Environmental<br />\nScience, at the University of<br />\nWashington, gave a lecture at<br />\nthe National Aquarium on<br />\nthese islands and their<br />\ninhabitants.<br />\nThe variety of wildlife and<br />\nbrilliant colors attract many<br />\ntourists, but the origin and<br />\nevolutionary significance of<br />\nthese islands interests many<br />\nscientists. The islands are all of<br />\nvolcanic birth and were never<br />\nconnected to the mainland.<br />\nCharles Darwin noted the<br />\nlarge variety of finches. Finches<br />\nare small terrestial birds that<br />\ntypically fly only short<br />\ndistances at a time. Thus, it is<br />\ntheorized that the twenty or so<br />\nspecies of Galapagos finches<br />\nevolved from only one pair of<br />\nLatin American finches. The<br />\nlizards, snakes, iguanas and<br />\nother small terrestial reptiles<br />\nmay have evolved from<br />\nancestors that rafted over to the<br />\nislands on large pieces of driftwood. The islands' only terrestrial mammals are the bats,<br />\nwhich presumably flew over,<br />\nand the wild dogs, pigs, and<br />\nrats which were brought over<br />\nby sailors about one hundred<br />\nyears ago.<br />\nThe Galapagos Islands are<br />\nimportant for evolutionary<br />\nstudy because the small number<br />\nof plant seeds and animals that<br />\ndid reach them have evolved<br />\nseparately from their ancestors<br />\nin South America. To prevent<br />\nhuman interference in the<br />\nislands' ecosystems, the<br />\nEcuadorian government has<br />\nstrict rules for visitors. Tourists<br />\nmust always be accompanied by<br />\na national park approved guide<br />\n<br />\nand may not remain overnight<br />\non the islands unless given<br />\nspecial permission. No food or<br />\ndrink, except water, are allowed on the islands. Essentially,<br />\nnothing is to be brought onto,<br />\nor taken off of, the islands.<br />\nAccording to Orians, traveling around the Galapagos<br />\nIslands is like being in a different world. The most striking<br />\nfeature is that the animals are<br />\nrelatively unafraid of humans.<br />\nOne need not crawl and crouch<br />\nin tall grass or use hidden<br />\ncameras to observe their<br />\nbehavior.<br />\nThe animals on the islands'<br />\nare quite spectacular and most<br />\nare unique to the Galapagos<br />\nIslands.

Other birds on the<br />\nislands include the Galapagos<br />\npenguins, albatroses, the lava<br />\ngulls, owls, and very small birds<br />\ncalled fly catchers.<br />\nThe islands have two types of<br />\nmarine animals\u2014the fur seals<br />\nand the sea lion. Unfortunately, the population of seals is low<br />\nbecause many were hunted for<br />\ntheir pelts. The few that remain<br />\nare not often seen because they<br />\nare timid and also cannot stay<br />\nout in the sun for long because<br />\nthey have thick fur coats. The<br />\nsea lions, on the other hand,<br />\ncan be seen nesting all over the<br />\nbeaches.

They will attack<br />\nhumans.<br />\nOnly at the Galapagos Islands<br />\nare there iguanas which can<br />\nswim. Marine iguanas have flat<br />\nlateral tails used for propelling<br />\nthemselves in the water. On<br />\nland, they may be seen stretched<br />\nout on rocks. They bask in the<br />\nsun to warm up while they<br />\n'digest their food. Because the<br />\nalgae they eat is very salty, these<br />\nmarine iguana excrete salt water<br />\nough their nostrils.

The lowlands are arid<br />\nand most plants there are cacti or resemble them, in having succulent, leathery leaves<br />\nand small flowers. When the<br />\nwind forces the few clouds up<br />\ninto the cooler air of the<br />\nhighlands, the clouds release<br />\ntheir water. In the highlands,<br />\nthere are morning glories, ferns<br />\nand very large trees.

Alfred A.<br />\nKnopf. 447 pages. $18.95.<br />\n<br />\nBarbara Tuchman is one of<br />\nthe few historians who has<br />\ndeveloped a mass following.<br />\nHer readers range from<br />\ngenerals to university professors to the mass public. Her<br />\nability to paint a picture, to<br />\ndraw a panorama of historical<br />\nevents of great importance is<br />\nher strength. Tuchman's<br />\nreaders have come to expect a<br />\ngreat deal from her, and their<br />\nexpectations have been<br />\nfulfilled\u2014that is, until now.<br />\nShe has just come out with a<br />\nnew book, which, for her, is in<br />\na new realm, that of historical<br />\nanalysis. Let us hope that she<br />\ndecides to stick to narrative<br />\nhistory next time.<br />\nTuchman's latest work: The<br />\nMarch of Folly: From Troy to<br />\nVietnam is lucid, as Tuchman<br />\nhasn't lost her gift for telling<br />\nstories. In fact, she tells four of<br />\nthem in The March ofFolly, all<br />\nof which shed light on the<br />\ngeneral tendency for governments to commit folly. According to Tuchman, \"folly is a<br />\nnoticeable<br />\nphenomenon<br />\nthroughout history regardless<br />\nof place or period,[and] is the<br />\npursuit by governments of<br />\npolicies contrary to their own<br />\ninterests.\" She seeks to ask why<br />\n\"holders of high office so often<br />\nact contrary to the way reason<br />\npoints them and self-interest<br />\nsuggests?\"<br />\nTuchman limits herself to<br />\ncases where government's<br />\npolicies were clearly counterproductive at the time they were<br />\npursued. She adds that alternatives to the policies were<br />\navailable when they were pursued and that the policies were<br />\nthe product of a group of people rather than of an individual.<br />\nTuchman uses the horse incident of the Trojan War as a<br />\nthree in_model for the other<br />\n<br />\nstances of folly: the 16th cen- \u2022<br />\ntury popes and their corrupt<br />\npractices that led to the Protestant Reformation, the 18th century British and their policies<br />\nthat led to the American<br />\nRevolution, and the 20th century Americans and their<br />\npolicies that led to the Vietnam<br />\ndebacle.<br />\n<br />\nOF<br />\n<br />\nF ROM TROY<br />\nTO VIETNAM<br />\n<br />\nher hindsight to suggest that<br />\nthey are? In the Trojan's<br />\nminds, if they had left the horse<br />\noutside the gates they might<br />\nhave offended the goddess<br />\nAthena, who might have<br />\nwreaked havoc on Troy. In the<br />\npopes' minds, they were acting<br />\nin their self-interests. The fact<br />\nthat their interests didn't coincide with the interests of the<br />\nCatholic Church means that<br />\nwhen the interests of the ruler<br />\nand the interests of the institution which he is ruling are at<br />\nodds, the ruler sometimes will<br />\ngive preference to his interests.<br />\nFinally, neither the British loss<br />\nof colonies nor the Vietnam<br />\ndebacle was clearly a folly when<br />\nthe decisions leading to these<br />\nlosses were made.<br />\nThe third major flaw is the<br />\nmost serious. It concerns<br />\nTuchman's purpose in writing<br />\nthe book. She raises some interesting questions in her introduction and then proceeds to<br />\nignore them throughout the rest<br />\nof the book. She cites three major instances of government<br />\nblunders, but fails to suggest<br />\nwhy they occur. If she wants to<br />\nshed light on folly, she must<br />\nguide us through the less important details to the point where<br />\nthe egregius errors of the<br />\ngovernments were committed,<br />\nsuggest the reasons why they<br />\n<br />\nwere committed, and then compare them. Instead, she raises<br />\nquestions and then proceeds to<br />\npaint her historical panorama,<br />\nleaving the issues by the<br />\nwayside.<br />\nIf Tuchman sought to do<br />\nanalysis, her case studies should<br />\nhave served to illuminate more<br />\ngeneral points. Unfortunately,<br />\nthe studies have replaced the<br />\npoints and the books purpose<br />\nhas been lost in the shuffle.<br />\nTuchman has assumed the role<br />\nof a political scientist in this<br />\nendeavor and has thoroughly<br />\nfailed.<br />\nTuchman took on a difficult<br />\ntask in writing this book, but<br />\nbefore I opened the front cover<br />\nI thought she was up to it.

The<br />\nshow's got everything: a pudgy<br />\noy-veying owner of a Skid Row<br />\nflower shop, an impossibly nerdy assistant who likes to mess<br />\naround with \"strange and unsual plants,\" a 3-member<br />\nfemale chorus (Crystal, Chiffon, and Ronnette), and an<br />\n<br />\nunidentified flytrap that's<br />\ndeveloping an alarming taste<br />\nfor human blood. Seymour, the<br />\nhapless florist's helper, is in<br />\nlove with Audrey, a lispy, googly blonde who's almost as<br />\ndumb as one of his plants (he<br />\nnames the little flytrap Audrey<br />\nII in her honor), but Audrey's<br />\nin love with a sadistic dentist in<br />\nmotorcycle leathers\u2014and when<br />\nAudrey II's appetite can no<br />\nlonger be satisfied by drops<br />\nfrom Seymour's fingers, it<br />\nseems clear that there are some<br />\ngirl-beating dentists in the<br />\nworld who deserve to be dinner.<br />\nAudrey II flourishes, the flower<br />\nshop's in the pink, and<br />\nSeymour gets adopted by the<br />\nowner and wins the girl\u2014but<br />\nthe plant's still hungry. You can<br />\ntake it from there.<br />\nAudrey II is unmistakably<br />\nthe star of this show. Starting<br />\nout looking a bit like a bulbous<br />\nKermit, the plant writhes,<br />\nboogies, flails its tentacles<br />\naround and most of all<br />\nGROWS until it takes over the<br />\nentire stage. The plant has a leer<br />\nyou wouldn't believe (what do<br />\nyou expect from something<br />\nwhose whole face is lips?) and<br />\na great, funky bass voice provided by Michael Leslie. Puppeteer William Szymanski(who<br />\nalso turns up as a wino early on<br />\nin the show) manages to make<br />\nAudrey II's lip-smacking and<br />\nbobbing<br />\nhilariously<br />\n<br />\nAudrey H, the star of<br />\n<br />\nress hoto<br />\n<br />\nLittle Shop of Horrors.<br />\n<br />\nconvincing\u2014this is a jive plant, that way in the cast), is a little<br />\nmake no mistake.<br />\ntoo broadly insufferable.<br />\nThe rest of the cast seem to<br />\nGiven the sheer fun of this<br />\nbe having a great time.

This assessment, however, is not entirely correct. While<br />\nthe Office has sponsored numerous activities<br />\nassociated with political and social groups<br />\nand also has virtually ignored religion on this<br />\ncampus, it has accomplished a great deal for<br />\nthe community.<br />\nWith the departure of Chester Wickwire<br />\nas University Chaplain, several questions<br />\nabout his office's purpose must be asked.<br />\nWill the new chaplain be more involved<br />\nwith religion on the Homewood campus?<br />\nWhile the Jewish Students Association<br />\norganizes services every weekend, the current Chaplain's Office, instead, presents the<br />\nSunday Experience which seldom deals with<br />\nreligion. Recent topics have included \"Continuing Issues in the 80s,\" \"The Reader's<br />\nDigest and 60 Minutes vs. The National and<br />\nWorld Councils of Church,\" and various<br />\nfilms, such as \"Judgment at Nuremberg.\"<br />\nWill the programs currently run by the<br />\nChaplain's Office continue?<br />\nAssociate Dean of Students Chris Colombo has said that the Weekend Wonder Flix,<br />\nthe Reel World, and the Bijou film series,<br />\nthe Student Handbook, and Chester's Place<br />\nwill be under the auspices of Student Activities Director Mary Ellen Porter, who<br />\nworked in the Office for two years during<br />\nthe late 70s.<br />\nWhile students should continue to operate<br />\nthe film series, someone must volunteer his<br /><br />\nservices or be hired by the University to run<br />\nChester's Place, as was the case when the<br />\npopular Wednesday nightspot was under the<br />\nChaplain's Office. Porter has too many<br />\nother responsibilities.<br />\nWhile the film series and Chester's Place<br />\nshould continue because they benefit<br />\nstudents, the Student Handbook should no<br />\nlonger exist, unless it is totally redesigned.<br />\nCurrently, few people read it or simply don't<br />\nknow about it.<br />\nWhat will happen to the Tutorial Project<br />\nand the Sunday Experience? Supposedly, the<br />\nnew Chaplain's Office will continue to offer them. The Tutorial Project should continue, for it's the only tangible University activity which benefits the community. Someone must take on that responsibility, and<br />\nit might as well be the University Chaplain.<br />\nAs for the Sunday Experience, it also<br />\nshould continue, but its function must<br />\nchange. Students should be given the option<br />\nto attend ecumenical services on the college campus. Why should Hopkins be different from most other universities?<br />\nThe Sunday Experience and other<br />\nChaplain Office-sponsored events should not<br />\nbe used as social or political forums. The<br />\nChaplain, a University employee, should not<br />\npublicly voice his opinions on Central<br />\nAmerica and the Middle East because people may assume that the University supports<br />\nhis views.<br />\nBefore Wickwire's replacement is selected,<br />\nthe role of University Chaplain must be better defined.<br /><br />\nLetters<br />\nBreach of Contract<br />\nTo the Editor:<br />\nBecause the election of class<br />\nofficers is on such a small scale,<br />\nthe issue of personal ethics rarely enters the political arena.<br />\nBut, unfortunately, this was not<br />\nthe case in this past week's election for senior class president.<br />\nIn the past race for student<br />\ncouncil president, Joe Attar approached me with a request to<br />\ndraw a poster on his behalf. I<br />\nobliged without much thought<br />\nor consideration of Joe as a<br />\ncandidate. Upon his defeat,<br />\nhowever, I forgot about the<br />\nposters and the incident.<br />\nRecently, Joe approached me<br />\nagain with a request for more<br />\nposters, this time for senior<br />\nclass president but I couldn't<br />\nbecause of other commitments.<br />\nJoe was persistent and even<br />\nresorted to offering me various<br />\nfuture enticements if he obtained office. Still, I had to decline.<br />\nI did not see Joe for the next<br />\nfew days, until he came and<br />\ntold me that he had doctored<br />\nmy original posters and had<br />\nalready printed them without<br />\ngetting my permission. I was<br />\nnot pleased with this, but at<br />\nthat point, there was nothing I<br />\ncould do.<br />\nWith his gaining a spot in the<br />\nrun-off election, however, I feel<br />\nit necessary to point out his<br /><br />\nbreach of trust displayed by the<br />\nman who hopes to be a class<br />\nleader. In no way do I support<br />\nJoe Attar or any other candidate for political office<br />\nbeyond the casting of my personal vote, and I offer this letter as a disclaimer to my posters<br />\nand to whatever they may imply about my opinions.<br />\nEvan Krakovitz<br /><br />\nPolitical Coverage<br />\nTo the Editor:<br /><br />\ntative for the Class of '86. He<br />\ncollected enough signatures on<br />\nhis petition, it was accepted and<br />\nyet if you read last week's<br />\nnewspaper, you never would<br />\nhave known that he was a<br />\ncandidate.<br />\nEven though Kevin followed<br />\nthe same procedure as his opponents, he didn't receive adequate press coverage. It's only<br />\nfair to announce the candidates<br />\nwho are seeking office,<br />\nespecially when their names appear on the official ballot.<br />\nI'm certain that this failure to<br />\nprint Kevin's name in last<br />\nweek's News-Letter was a gross<br />\noversight, and I'm sure that the<br />\nNews-Letter will print an<br />\napology to its readers, in keeping with its policy of fairness<br />\nand equal time to all<br />\ncandidates.<br />\nI only wish that the election<br />\ncommittee follows the same<br />\npractice. It seems that after seeing Kevin's name on his petition and on his candidate's<br />\nstatement, it still chose to spell<br />\nit incorrectly. It is spelled TULLY, not Tulley. I hope that this<br />\nwill be corrected before Tuesday's run-off election.<br /><br />\nYou cannot pick up an issue<br />\nof the News-Letter without<br />\nreading about campus politics.<br />\nThis, however, has gotten out<br />\nof hand. When the News-Letter<br />\nattacked Maureen Freed, I let<br />\nthis pass because elected officials are subject to such public<br />\nscrutiny, especially by the press.<br />\nBut when the News-Letter<br />\nstarts endorsing candidates for<br />\nstudent office, you have to<br />\nwonder. I'm sure Jon Lana did<br />\nnot pay money for an advertisement describing his political<br />\naspirations, and yet the NewsLetter endorsed his candidacy<br />\nover Joe Attar for student<br />\ncouncil president. I only can<br />\nwonder who has the authority<br />\nRobert Gilbert<br />\nto make such a decision.<br />\nIn the same manner, I Knowing What It's Like<br />\nwonder who chose not to men- To the Editor:<br />\ntion that Kevin Tully was seekCongratulations to the cast<br />\ning the office of class represen-<br /><br />\nand crew of Hair.<br />\nBeing a performer myself, I<br />\ncan easily see how much time<br />\nand effort went into the production.

But it is<br />\nnot deaf to our requests, and<br />\nagain, I cite the Hut. In fact,<br />\nAssociate Dean of Students<br />\nChris Colombo has already<br />\nmade sure that the Bijou will<br />\nrun this summer, and the SAC<br />\nwill probably take our other<br />\ntwo film series. (Mary Ellen<br />\nPorter will control all three film<br />\nseries.)<br />\nSo what's my point?<br />\nHaving been Director of<br />\nWeekend Wonder Flix and having helped Bill Tiefenwerth of<br />\nthe Chaplain's Office with the<br />\nbackground work for another<br />\nfilm series has made it quite<br />\nclear that Mary Ellen Porter<br /><br />\nTalent Galore<br />\nTo the Editor:<br />\nI'd like to express my appreciation and respect to the<br />\npeople who were responsible<br />\nfor the recent staging of the<br />\nmusical, Hair.<br />\nThe show was danced, acted,<br />\nand directed entirely by<br />\nstudents, and was essentially an<br />\nindependant production, funded not by the Barnstormers, but<br />\nby the Union Board.<br />\nWith theatre at Hopkins<br />\nalready alarmingly undersupported, the decision to put on<br />\na separate program the same<br />\nweekend as the Barn's Taming<br />\nof the Shrew was precarious.<br />\nHere, at this cultural wasteland,<br />\nthere is a limited number of<br />\npeople who are willing to get involved in the performing arts,<br />\neither as participants or audience. But Hair sold out all<br />\nthree nights, and was enjoyed<br />\nby almost everyone who saw it.<br />\nAt any other school, this<br />\nphenomenon of two plays in<br />\none weekend would go unnoticed. But at the nerd outlet called Johns Hopkins, where student participation at all levels<br />\nof activities is dismal, the time<br />\nand the effort put in by the cast<br />\nand crew of Hair are to be<br />\ngreatly admired.

The bottom line<br />\nof this decision, however, must<br />\nbe an awareness that all individuals experience grief differently. If a student is not able<br />\nto handle what a particular professor might consider a reasonable workload, then the Office<br />\nof Advising and Counseling<br />\nshould be able to pursue the<br />\nmatter further as the student's<br />\nadvocate.<br />\nAdditionally, there is one<br />\npoint in Joff Masukawa's letter that disturbed me. He said,<br />\n\"I find the Office completely<br />\ndevoid of emotion when it<br />\ncomes to discussing specific<br />\nacademic problems at Hopkins,<br />\nwhether they involve a certain<br />\nprofessor or the education at<br />\nHopkins in general.\"<br />\nI am sorry if he has experienced this in his requests for<br />\nhelp at the Office. From my<br /><br />\npersonal experience in the last<br />\nthree years, Arlene Wergin, Bill<br />\nZulch, and Martha Roseman<br />\nhave always been receptive.<br />\nJoff's letter also said that the<br />\nOffice should be \"more communicative, more supportive,<br />\nmore aware, and more<br />\ncooperative.\"<br />\nBut I was just wondering<br />\nhow many premeds out there<br />\nneeded an extension for handing in their completed applications to the Health Professions<br />\nRecommendations Committee,<br />\neven though the information<br />\nhad been given out four months<br />\nbefore the deadline? But how<br />\nmany of us who got an extension realized the \"supportive\"ness and \"cooperative' -ness of<br />\nMary Brune and others in the<br />\noffice when we were the ones<br />\nwho were short on cooperation?<br />\nI sincerely believe that people<br />\nwho are unhappy with their experiences in any office of this<br />\nuniversity should voice their<br />\ngrievances. Letters about Advising and Counseling, the<br />\nHousing Office, and other student services can lead to an improved situation for us. But I<br />\nthink that those of us who are<br />\nexperiencing something positive<br />\nevery once in a while also<br />\nshould say something.

Although these<br />\nislands are located on the<br />\nequator, they do not have the<br />\nsame climate as Hawaii or the<br />\nCaribbean. The only sunbathers are the iguanas, and the<br />\ntourists live off boats rather<br />\nthan in hotels. There are several<br />\nhundred Galapagos Islands and<br />\nall are about 600 miles off the<br />\nSouth American coast. Over<br />\nthree-fourths are uninhabited<br />\nand are part of an Ecuadorian<br />\nnational park.<br />\nLast Friday, Dr. Gordon<br />\nOrians, a full professor of<br />\nzoology and director of the Institute of Environmental<br />\nScience, at the University of<br />\nWashington, gave a lecture at<br />\nthe National Aquarium on<br />\nthese islands and their<br />\ninhabitants.<br />\nThe variety of wildlife and<br />\nbrilliant colors attract many<br />\ntourists, but the origin and<br />\nevolutionary significance of<br />\nthese islands interests many<br />\nscientists. The islands are all of<br />\nvolcanic birth and were never<br />\nconnected to the mainland.<br />\nCharles Darwin noted the<br />\nlarge variety of finches. Finches<br />\nare small terrestial birds that<br />\ntypically fly only short<br />\ndistances at a time. Thus, it is<br />\ntheorized that the twenty or so<br />\nspecies of Galapagos finches<br />\nevolved from only one pair of<br />\nLatin American finches. The<br />\nlizards, snakes, iguanas and<br />\nother small terrestial reptiles<br />\nmay have evolved from<br />\nancestors that rafted over to the<br />\nislands on large pieces of driftwood. The islands' only terrestrial mammals are the bats,<br />\nwhich presumably flew over,<br />\nand the wild dogs, pigs, and<br />\nrats which were brought over<br />\nby sailors about one hundred<br />\nyears ago.<br />\nThe Galapagos Islands are<br />\nimportant for evolutionary<br />\nstudy because the small number<br />\nof plant seeds and animals that<br />\ndid reach them have evolved<br />\nseparately from their ancestors<br />\nin South America. To prevent<br />\nhuman interference in the<br />\nislands' ecosystems, the<br />\nEcuadorian government has<br />\nstrict rules for visitors. Tourists<br />\nmust always be accompanied by<br />\na national park approved guide<br /><br />\nand may not remain overnight<br />\non the islands unless given<br />\nspecial permission. No food or<br />\ndrink, except water, are allowed on the islands. Essentially,<br />\nnothing is to be brought onto,<br />\nor taken off of, the islands.<br />\nAccording to Orians, traveling around the Galapagos<br />\nIslands is like being in a different world. The most striking<br />\nfeature is that the animals are<br />\nrelatively unafraid of humans.<br />\nOne need not crawl and crouch<br />\nin tall grass or use hidden<br />\ncameras to observe their<br />\nbehavior.<br />\nThe animals on the islands'<br />\nare quite spectacular and most<br />\nare unique to the Galapagos<br />\nIslands.

Other birds on the<br />\nislands include the Galapagos<br />\npenguins, albatroses, the lava<br />\ngulls, owls, and very small birds<br />\ncalled fly catchers.<br />\nThe islands have two types of<br />\nmarine animals\u2014the fur seals<br />\nand the sea lion. Unfortunately, the population of seals is low<br />\nbecause many were hunted for<br />\ntheir pelts. The few that remain<br />\nare not often seen because they<br />\nare timid and also cannot stay<br />\nout in the sun for long because<br />\nthey have thick fur coats. The<br />\nsea lions, on the other hand,<br />\ncan be seen nesting all over the<br />\nbeaches.

They will attack<br />\nhumans.<br />\nOnly at the Galapagos Islands<br />\nare there iguanas which can<br />\nswim. Marine iguanas have flat<br />\nlateral tails used for propelling<br />\nthemselves in the water. On<br />\nland, they may be seen stretched<br />\nout on rocks. They bask in the<br />\nsun to warm up while they<br />\n'digest their food. Because the<br />\nalgae they eat is very salty, these<br />\nmarine iguana excrete salt water<br />\nough their nostrils.

According to Tuchman, \"folly is a<br />\nnoticeable<br />\nphenomenon<br />\nthroughout history regardless<br />\nof place or period,[and] is the<br />\npursuit by governments of<br />\npolicies contrary to their own<br />\ninterests.\" She seeks to ask why<br />\n\"holders of high office so often<br />\nact contrary to the way reason<br />\npoints them and self-interest<br />\nsuggests?\"<br />\nTuchman limits herself to<br />\ncases where government's<br />\npolicies were clearly counterproductive at the time they were<br />\npursued. She adds that alternatives to the policies were<br />\navailable when they were pursued and that the policies were<br />\nthe product of a group of people rather than of an individual.<br />\nTuchman uses the horse incident of the Trojan War as a<br />\nthree in_model for the other<br /><br />\nstances of folly: the 16th cen- \u2022<br />\ntury popes and their corrupt<br />\npractices that led to the Protestant Reformation, the 18th century British and their policies<br />\nthat led to the American<br />\nRevolution, and the 20th century Americans and their<br />\npolicies that led to the Vietnam<br />\ndebacle.<br /><br />\nOF<br /><br />\nF ROM TROY<br />\nTO VIETNAM<br /><br />\nher hindsight to suggest that<br />\nthey are? In the Trojan's<br />\nminds, if they had left the horse<br />\noutside the gates they might<br />\nhave offended the goddess<br />\nAthena, who might have<br />\nwreaked havoc on Troy. In the<br />\npopes' minds, they were acting<br />\nin their self-interests. The fact<br />\nthat their interests didn't coincide with the interests of the<br />\nCatholic Church means that<br />\nwhen the interests of the ruler<br />\nand the interests of the institution which he is ruling are at<br />\nodds, the ruler sometimes will<br />\ngive preference to his interests.<br />\nFinally, neither the British loss<br />\nof colonies nor the Vietnam<br />\ndebacle was clearly a folly when<br />\nthe decisions leading to these<br />\nlosses were made.<br />\nThe third major flaw is the<br />\nmost serious. It concerns<br />\nTuchman's purpose in writing<br />\nthe book. She raises some interesting questions in her introduction and then proceeds to<br />\nignore them throughout the rest<br />\nof the book. She cites three major instances of government<br />\nblunders, but fails to suggest<br />\nwhy they occur. If she wants to<br />\nshed light on folly, she must<br />\nguide us through the less important details to the point where<br />\nthe egregius errors of the<br />\ngovernments were committed,<br />\nsuggest the reasons why they<br /><br />\nwere committed, and then compare them. Instead, she raises<br />\nquestions and then proceeds to<br />\npaint her historical panorama,<br />\nleaving the issues by the<br />\nwayside.<br />\nIf Tuchman sought to do<br />\nanalysis, her case studies should<br />\nhave served to illuminate more<br />\ngeneral points. Unfortunately,<br />\nthe studies have replaced the<br />\npoints and the books purpose<br />\nhas been lost in the shuffle.<br />\nTuchman has assumed the role<br />\nof a political scientist in this<br />\nendeavor and has thoroughly<br />\nfailed.<br />\nTuchman took on a difficult<br />\ntask in writing this book, but<br />\nbefore I opened the front cover<br />\nI thought she was up to it. Unfortunately, I have to admit<br />\nthat I was wrong. Her history<br />\nis strong, but that's where the<br />\nstory ends.<br />\n\"Conversations with Barbara Tuchman,\" a lecture<br />\nsponsored by the history<br />\ndepartment and by the Alumni<br />\nAssociation, will focus primarily on her new book.<br />\nThe lecture will be held in<br />\nShriver Hall at 8 p.m. Wednesday, April 25.

These incidents are interesting and<br />\ncould have been published as<br />\nseparate extended essays.

First, the case<br />\nstudies fail to shed any new<br />\nlight on these four familiar<br />\nepisodes of history. The Reformation and the Trojan horse incident have been thoroughly<br />\nwritten about in the past.

Besides, other<br />\nbooks are much more insightful<br />\non these cases, such as David<br />\nHalberstam's The Best and the<br />\nBrightest on the Vietnam War.<br />\nSecond, there is some question as to whether these four instances are clear cases of folly<br />\nas Tuchman suggests.

Camp, doowop, and a people-munching<br />\nplant at the snooty Mechanic?<br />\nHometown pride forces me to<br />\npoint out that we have<br />\nBaltimorean Howard Ashman<br />\nto thank for livening up the<br />\nseason: he wrote the book and<br />\nlyrics and directs this production of Little Shop of Horrors,<br />\nthe elaborately goofy musical<br />\nbased on a 1960 no-budget<br />\nRoger Corman horror spoof.<br />\n(Corman's other credits, for<br />\nthose not familiar with his contribution to American film, include A Bucket of Blood, Attack of the Crab Monsters,<br />\nTeenage Caveman, Swamp<br />\nWoman, and The Undead\u2014he<br />\nhas more entries than any one<br />\nelse in the index of the<br />\nPsychotronic Encyclopedia of<br />\nFilm, my favorite guide to<br />\nweird movies, which mentions<br />\nthat the original Little Shop<br />\ntook two and a half days to<br />\nfilm.)<br />\nThe cult-classic comedy was<br />\na natural for a smash OffBroadway hit, of course. The<br />\nshow's got everything: a pudgy<br />\noy-veying owner of a Skid Row<br />\nflower shop, an impossibly nerdy assistant who likes to mess<br />\naround with \"strange and unsual plants,\" a 3-member<br />\nfemale chorus (Crystal, Chiffon, and Ronnette), and an<br /><br />\nunidentified flytrap that's<br />\ndeveloping an alarming taste<br />\nfor human blood. Seymour, the<br />\nhapless florist's helper, is in<br />\nlove with Audrey, a lispy, googly blonde who's almost as<br />\ndumb as one of his plants (he<br />\nnames the little flytrap Audrey<br />\nII in her honor), but Audrey's<br />\nin love with a sadistic dentist in<br />\nmotorcycle leathers\u2014and when<br />\nAudrey II's appetite can no<br />\nlonger be satisfied by drops<br />\nfrom Seymour's fingers, it<br />\nseems clear that there are some<br />\ngirl-beating dentists in the<br />\nworld who deserve to be dinner.<br />\nAudrey II flourishes, the flower<br />\nshop's in the pink, and<br />\nSeymour gets adopted by the<br />\nowner and wins the girl\u2014but<br />\nthe plant's still hungry. You can<br />\ntake it from there.<br />\nAudrey II is unmistakably<br />\nthe star of this show. Starting<br />\nout looking a bit like a bulbous<br />\nKermit, the plant writhes,<br />\nboogies, flails its tentacles<br />\naround and most of all<br />\nGROWS until it takes over the<br />\nentire stage. The plant has a leer<br />\nyou wouldn't believe (what do<br />\nyou expect from something<br />\nwhose whole face is lips?) and<br />\na great, funky bass voice provided by Michael Leslie. Puppeteer William Szymanski(who<br />\nalso turns up as a wino early on<br />\nin the show) manages to make<br />\nAudrey II's lip-smacking and<br />\nbobbing<br />\nhilariously<br /><br />\nAudrey H, the star of<br /><br />\nress hoto<br /><br />\nLittle Shop of Horrors.<br /><br />\nconvincing\u2014this is a jive plant, that way in the cast), is a little<br />\nmake no mistake.<br />\ntoo broadly insufferable.<br />\nThe rest of the cast seem to<br />\nGiven the sheer fun of this<br />\nbe having a great time.
