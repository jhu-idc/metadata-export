He said he hoped a<br />\ndecision either to sustain the<br />\nprogram or to discontinue it<br />\naltogether will be reached.<br />\n\"The question that is to be<br />\nasked is 'D.\u00b0 we have an<br />\nIntersession?,\" the Dean stated.<br />\nSuskind further stressed that<br />\nthe issue centered not on<br />\nWhether credit should be given<br />\nfor Intersession courses but on<br />\nwhether the program should be<br />\noffered at all.<br />\n\"There's a general<br />\ndisenchantment about<br />\nIntersession but it's. not<br />\nnecessarily a reaction from which<br />\na non-credit recommendation<br />\nshould be derived,\" Suskind<br />\ncon tinned.<br />\n\"We can either deal with the<br />\nissue head-on and decide 'yes' to<br />\n<br />\nkeep it in which case changes<br />\nwill have to be made, or `no' or<br />\nwe can allow the system to decay<br />\nby instituting non-credit.\"<br />\n\u2022 Suskind expressed the feeling<br />\nthat presently, the CUS would<br />\nnot be ready to make any<br />\nstatements on Intersession and<br />\nwould be relying on an historical<br />\nperspective study when it makes<br />\nits decision at its next meeting<br />\nslated for March 7.<br />\nOn another subject. speaking<br />\n-about the increase of freshmen<br />\non probation according to last<br />\nsemester's figures, Suskind stated<br />\nthat many freshmen complained<br />\nthat the comprehensive Pass/Fail<br />\ngrading system, which codes all<br />\nfirst semester grades for<br />\nfreshmen, was responsible for not<br />\nhaving provided enough academic<br />\nbackdrop against which to strive<br />\nfor academic success.<br />\nAccording to figures from the<br />\nOffice of Undergraduate Studies.<br />\napproximately 25 freshmen were<br />\non probation due to<br />\nunsatisfactory performance last<br />\nsemester. Close to ten had<br />\nachieved a 0.00 Grade Point<br />\nAverage.<br />\n\"I can't make any correlation<br />\nat. this time between these<br />\nstatistics and the Pass/Fail<br />\n<br />\nsee INTER, page 2<br />\n<br />\nemployees and worn-out<br />\nequipment. \"I didn't let the<br />\ncontroller's office spend a nickel<br />\non equipment,\" Bowie said<br />\nBenton added. \"We're holding<br />\nback on filling certain positions,'<br />\nalthough we have no hiring freeze<br />\nand I'm asking managers to<br />\nslowdown on equipment<br />\nreplacement.\" Both moves are<br />\npart of what Bowie said would be,<br />\na successful effort to keep the<br />\ncurrent budget in balance.<br />\nSince President Muller has<br />\npledged not to increase tuition<br />\nfor 1 974-7 5, balancing next<br />\nyear's budget may be particularly<br />\ntricky. Indications are that funds<br />\nto balance the budget will come<br />\nfrom unrestricted gifts to the<br />\nUniversity that are spent at the<br />\nPresident's disgretion and from<br />\nincreased recovery of indirect<br />\ncosts from research projects.<br />\nBenton said. \"Withou<br />\n<br />\nquestion, I'd say the President is<br />\ngoing to have to send more<br />\n(unrestricted money) to<br />\nHomewood than in previous<br />\nyears.\"<br />\nBOth . Benton and Bowie<br />\npointed to sharply rising paper<br />\ncosts as another factor in the<br />\npresent inflationary spiral. Bowie<br />\nstated, \"We're pretty hard hit<br />\nwith paper. The computer paper<br />\nbeing used, for example, is not of<br />\nthe same quality as before\"<br />\nAlthough costs are rising<br />\nrapidly, Arts and Sciences Dean<br />\nGeorge Owen stated that the<br />\npresent faculty of 274 might<br />\nincrease by as many as five<br />\nmembers next year, if the usual<br />\nnumber of terminations and<br />\nresignations is reduced by the<br />\neconomic situation. \"It won't go<br />\nbelow 274,\" he pledged.<br />\nSince 60 percent of the<br />\nUniversity's budget goes to<br />\n<br />\nRobert C. Bowie<br />\nsalaries, according to Bowie,<br />\nevery one percent increase costs<br />\nabout $600,000. A six percent<br />\nincrease would then cost $3.6<br />\nmillion.<br />\n<br />\nReligion seen as minor factor<br />\nBy MICHAEL MANES<br />\nAlthough Hopkins is<br />\nconsidered by most a very secular<br />\nuniversity, it maintains three<br />\nMajor organizations that deal<br />\nspecifically with organized<br />\nreligion.<br />\nAmong these organizations are<br />\nthe Office of the Chaplain, an<br />\nofficial University office, the<br />\nJewish Student Association, and<br />\nthe Catholic Community on<br />\nCampus, which is headed by<br />\nFather Philip Cunningham. The<br />\nlatter two receive no University<br />\nfunds.<br />\nAccording to a poll of .25<br />\nrandom students taken by the<br />\nNews-Letter, however, only 20<br />\npercent of the undergraduates at<br />\nHopkins are actively involved<br />\nwith an organized religion on<br />\ncampus, whereas nearly 40<br />\npercent claimed they were<br />\nactively involved with religious<br />\ngroups off the campus, such as in<br />\ntheir own home state.<br />\nIn addition, when asked if<br />\nthey thought Hopkins students<br />\nwere 'apathetic about organized<br />\nreligion on campus, nearly 50<br />\npercent said yes, 25 percent said<br />\nno, and 25 percent had no<br />\nopinion. Finally, when asked of<br />\ntheir opinion of some of the<br />\nreligions activities on campus, 10<br />\npercent said that the activities<br />\nwere not very good, 25 percent<br />\nthought they were very good,<br />\nand 65 percent expressed no<br />\nopinion\u2014claiming they \"did not<br />\nknow enough\" about such<br />\nactivities as Sunday Experience,<br />\nCatholic CoMmunity on campus,<br />\nor Jewish Student Association.<br />\nWhen asked about the possible<br />\napathy towards organized<br />\nreligion on campus, Dean of<br />\nStudents Robert J. Fitzpatrick<br />\nnoted that perhaps it would be<br />\nan advantage if there were more<br />\nclergymen and rabbis on campus<br />\n<br />\nwho would be genuinely<br />\ninterested with the students.<br />\n\"I think that the organized<br />\nreligious groups on campus have<br />\nnot been as strong as expected,\"<br />\nFitzpatrick observed.<br />\nAccording to the Office of the<br />\nChaplain, however, over 95% of<br />\nthe incoming freshmen did<br />\nexpress a religious preference on<br />\ntheir applications. The<br />\nbreakdown for the class of 1977<br />\nis as follows: Jewish 40%, Roman<br />\n<br />\nCatholic 30%, Protestant 25%,<br />\nnon-denominational 5%.<br />\nThe most obvious organized<br />\nreligions group on campus is the<br />\nOffice of the Chaplain. Originally<br />\ndesigned to be primarily a social<br />\nfunction for the University, the<br />\nOffice of the Chaplain has come<br />\nto represent all religions for the<br />\nstudent body.

Also,<br />\nthe mini-term has put pressure on<br />\nthe faculty to offer courses,...\"<br />\n<br />\nI do not wish to take a position<br />\nof direct opposition to Dr.<br />\nSampson's belief(quoted earlier in<br />\nthe article) that \"(the minimester)<br />\n... has no legal approval, and<br />\nshould only be on a voluntary,<br />\nnon-credit system,\" because I feel<br />\ncertain that his ideas are based on<br />\ngood intentions. The minimester is<br />\nan important contrast to the rest<br />\nof the academic year, and its basic<br />\nprinciples (which I presume to be,<br />\nsimply, learning with no ulterior<br />\nmotive except the application of<br />\nwhat's been learned) should be<br />\ncarefolly guarded.<br />\nHowever, as both a full-time<br />\nundergraduate student and a<br />\nteacher of one of the minimester<br />\ncourses, I take as a direct insult<br />\nSampson's contentions that many<br />\n<br />\nof the minimester courses are<br />\n\"potentially fly-by-night\" and a<br />\nway of obtaining \"extra credits\"<br />\nFurthermore, his insinuation that<br />\nputting pressure on the faculty to<br />\noffer more courses is an<br />\nundesireable thing, is incredibly<br />\nbiasesl. Such a position amounts to<br />\nblatant ignorance of a student's<br />\ndesire to learn. This stance may<br />\nmake for much published paper,<br />\nbut is academically fatal in the<br />\nlong run.<br />\nThe idea of the minimester is to<br />\noffer material that is unobtainable<br />\nduring the regular semester, largely<br />\nbecause of Hopkins'<br />\nhorse-in-blinders approach to<br />\neducation. The credit system is<br />\ndesigned to acknowledge a certain<br />\ndegree of proficiency or skill in<br />\nsome area of endeavor. Note that<br />\nduring the regular term, a science<br />\nmajor receives credit for courses in<br />\nliterature, and vice-versa. That he<br />\nshould not would be an insult to<br />\nboth the respective field of study,<br />\nand the student's own efforts in<br />\nthat field. If an entire institution is<br />\nrun with a credit system, for that<br />\ninstitution not to accredit a course<br />\nto me means that it doesn't want<br />\nto accept responsibility for the<br />\ncourse. Two reasons for not<br />\naccepting this responsibility are:<br />\nthe course is poortly taught; and<br />\nthe course is in some trivial field of<br />\nendeavor. Thus to abolish the<br />\ncredit system during the<br />\nminimester while retaining it for<br />\nthe rest of the academic year is<br />\ntantamount to officially stating<br />\nthat all minimester courses are<br />\neither poorly taught or of trivial<br />\nimportance. To go further this<br />\nimplies that only those courses<br />\n<br />\ntaught during the regular year are<br />\nmore than trivial importance.<br />\nFinally, since the topics of<br />\nminimester courses are usually not<br />\ntaught during the regular year, Dr.<br />\nSampson's no-credit minimester<br />\ncontends that 11 courses necessary<br />\nto a Hopkins undergraduate, or<br />\ntruly worth his while to take, are<br />\nalready being offered. This is true.<br />\nOh, Come, All ye Robots!<br />\nIt is impossible for anybody to<br />\nacquire \"Extra credits.\" If one<br />\nexceeds the credit requirement for<br />\ngraduation, it's an obvious sign<br />\nthat the student concerned wished<br />\nto take a few courses of his own<br />\n<br />\nvolition. These courses are just as<br />\nimportant as any the short-sighted,<br />\nshallow and pompous<br />\nadministrations of this or any<br />\nother, university deem as being<br />\n\"necessary\" or \"required for<br />\ngraduation.\" Meanwhile, if this<br />\nstudent is allowed to graduate at<br />\nall it's a sure sign that the<br />\n\"requirements\" were fulfilled<br />\nanyhow.

Dr. Chester<br />\nWickwire, who is the official<br />\nChaplain of the University, has<br />\nbeen at Hopkins since the fall of<br />\n1952. Once the sole social<br />\nprogrammer of Hopkins.<br />\nWickwire was the man who<br />\norganized the famous concert<br />\nthat Duke Ellington had at<br />\nHopkins in the '50's.

The new Student<br />\ncouncil office was once the<br />\nUniversity's chapel.<br />\n\"We consider religion in a<br />\nbroader sense. Our feeling is that<br />\nreligion involves total worship<br />\nand not concentrating on any<br />\none aspect or area. I think that<br />\nwhat we try to do is humanize<br />\nthe campus. In an age of<br />\nbureaucratization one needs<br />\nencouragement in humanizing<br />\nthe scene,\" said Wickwire.<br />\n\"For example, our Sunday<br />\nmorning experience is not religous<br />\nin the strict sense where we have<br />\nreadings and prayers. At the<br />\nexperience we discuss aspects of<br />\nlife in general and attempt to<br />\nbring together individuals from<br />\nthe community of Baltimore and<br />\nthe campus. It is a place where<br />\nyou are able to speak out and be<br />\nheard. Also, our tutoring<br />\nprogram allows students to help<br />\npersons and give those persons a<br />\nunique one-to-one<br />\ncorrespondence with the<br />\nstudents. The tutorial service<br />\nprobably makes better citizens<br />\nand makes more persons aware of<br />\nreal problems,\" said Wickwire.<br />\nAmong the other activities<br />\nwhich the Office of the Chaplain<br />\nsponsors, is the course on<br />\nJuvenile Delinquency.<br />\n\"This is another program<br />\n<br />\nwhich attempts to make a<br />\none-to-one correspondence<br />\nbetween students and<br />\ncommunity.

As chaplain of the<br />\nUniversity he has also performed<br />\nweddings, addressed the<br />\ngraduating class on<br />\nCommemoration Day, and has<br />\neven been asked to perform a few<br />\nexorcisms.

Bowie.<br />\nState authorities pegged inflation<br />\nat 9.9 percent in Maryland last<br />\nyear.<br /><br />\n\"One of two things will<br />\nhappen,\" Bowie added. \"We<br />\nwon't have the money to give<br />\nproper increases or we'll bust the<br />\nbudget.\"<br />\nAccording to budget figures<br />\nfor fiscal 1975 supplied by<br />\nHomewood Vice President<br />\nGeorge S. Benton, the allottment<br />\nfor Homewood's fuel bill will rise<br />\nby $270,000 next year and will<br />\nbe sufficient<br />\nif present<br />\ninflationary trends continue. If<br />\nnatural gas prices are<br />\n'on trolled. the University's<br />\n.1 fuel bill will increase even<br />\nmu, Benton predicted. \"If gas<br />\nis decontrolled, the price will go<br />\nsky-high,\" he said.<br />\n.Gas up 20%<br />\nFuel costs for fiscal 1974 have<br />\nalready gone close to $40,000<br />\nabove their budgeted level and<br />\nmay exceed the allottment by as<br />\nmuch as $50,000 before the<br />\nwinter; is over. University<br />\nofficials say. Homewood has<br />\nbeen particularly hard hit by a<br />\ntripling in the price of the<br />\nnumber 6 oil, used as backup fuel<br />\nfor the heating plant.

He said he hoped a<br />\ndecision either to sustain the<br />\nprogram or to discontinue it<br />\naltogether will be reached.<br />\n\"The question that is to be<br />\nasked is 'D.\u00b0 we have an<br />\nIntersession?,\" the Dean stated.<br />\nSuskind further stressed that<br />\nthe issue centered not on<br />\nWhether credit should be given<br />\nfor Intersession courses but on<br />\nwhether the program should be<br />\noffered at all.<br />\n\"There's a general<br />\ndisenchantment about<br />\nIntersession but it's. not<br />\nnecessarily a reaction from which<br />\na non-credit recommendation<br />\nshould be derived,\" Suskind<br />\ncon tinned.<br />\n\"We can either deal with the<br />\nissue head-on and decide 'yes' to<br /><br />\nkeep it in which case changes<br />\nwill have to be made, or `no' or<br />\nwe can allow the system to decay<br />\nby instituting non-credit.\"<br />\n\u2022 Suskind expressed the feeling<br />\nthat presently, the CUS would<br />\nnot be ready to make any<br />\nstatements on Intersession and<br />\nwould be relying on an historical<br />\nperspective study when it makes<br />\nits decision at its next meeting<br />\nslated for March 7.<br />\nOn another subject. speaking<br />\n-about the increase of freshmen<br />\non probation according to last<br />\nsemester's figures, Suskind stated<br />\nthat many freshmen complained<br />\nthat the comprehensive Pass/Fail<br />\ngrading system, which codes all<br />\nfirst semester grades for<br />\nfreshmen, was responsible for not<br />\nhaving provided enough academic<br />\nbackdrop against which to strive<br />\nfor academic success.<br />\nAccording to figures from the<br />\nOffice of Undergraduate Studies.<br />\napproximately 25 freshmen were<br />\non probation due to<br />\nunsatisfactory performance last<br />\nsemester. Close to ten had<br />\nachieved a 0.00 Grade Point<br />\nAverage.<br />\n\"I can't make any correlation<br />\nat. this time between these<br />\nstatistics and the Pass/Fail<br /><br />\nsee INTER, page 2<br /><br />\nemployees and worn-out<br />\nequipment. \"I didn't let the<br />\ncontroller's office spend a nickel<br />\non equipment,\" Bowie said<br />\nBenton added. \"We're holding<br />\nback on filling certain positions,'<br />\nalthough we have no hiring freeze<br />\nand I'm asking managers to<br />\nslowdown on equipment<br />\nreplacement.\" Both moves are<br />\npart of what Bowie said would be,<br />\na successful effort to keep the<br />\ncurrent budget in balance.<br />\nSince President Muller has<br />\npledged not to increase tuition<br />\nfor 1 974-7 5, balancing next<br />\nyear's budget may be particularly<br />\ntricky. Indications are that funds<br />\nto balance the budget will come<br />\nfrom unrestricted gifts to the<br />\nUniversity that are spent at the<br />\nPresident's disgretion and from<br />\nincreased recovery of indirect<br />\ncosts from research projects.<br />\nBenton said. \"Withou<br /><br />\nquestion, I'd say the President is<br />\ngoing to have to send more<br />\n(unrestricted money) to<br />\nHomewood than in previous<br />\nyears.\"<br />\nBOth . Benton and Bowie<br />\npointed to sharply rising paper<br />\ncosts as another factor in the<br />\npresent inflationary spiral. Bowie<br />\nstated, \"We're pretty hard hit<br />\nwith paper. The computer paper<br />\nbeing used, for example, is not of<br />\nthe same quality as before\"<br />\nAlthough costs are rising<br />\nrapidly, Arts and Sciences Dean<br />\nGeorge Owen stated that the<br />\npresent faculty of 274 might<br />\nincrease by as many as five<br />\nmembers next year, if the usual<br />\nnumber of terminations and<br />\nresignations is reduced by the<br />\neconomic situation. \"It won't go<br />\nbelow 274,\" he pledged.<br />\nSince 60 percent of the<br />\nUniversity's budget goes to<br /><br />\nRobert C. Bowie<br />\nsalaries, according to Bowie,<br />\nevery one percent increase costs<br />\nabout $600,000. A six percent<br />\nincrease would then cost $3.6<br />\nmillion.<br /><br />\nReligion seen as minor factor<br />\nBy MICHAEL MANES<br />\nAlthough Hopkins is<br />\nconsidered by most a very secular<br />\nuniversity, it maintains three<br />\nMajor organizations that deal<br />\nspecifically with organized<br />\nreligion.<br />\nAmong these organizations are<br />\nthe Office of the Chaplain, an<br />\nofficial University office, the<br />\nJewish Student Association, and<br />\nthe Catholic Community on<br />\nCampus, which is headed by<br />\nFather Philip Cunningham. The<br />\nlatter two receive no University<br />\nfunds.<br />\nAccording to a poll of .25<br />\nrandom students taken by the<br />\nNews-Letter, however, only 20<br />\npercent of the undergraduates at<br />\nHopkins are actively involved<br />\nwith an organized religion on<br />\ncampus, whereas nearly 40<br />\npercent claimed they were<br />\nactively involved with religious<br />\ngroups off the campus, such as in<br />\ntheir own home state.<br />\nIn addition, when asked if<br />\nthey thought Hopkins students<br />\nwere 'apathetic about organized<br />\nreligion on campus, nearly 50<br />\npercent said yes, 25 percent said<br />\nno, and 25 percent had no<br />\nopinion. Finally, when asked of<br />\ntheir opinion of some of the<br />\nreligions activities on campus, 10<br />\npercent said that the activities<br />\nwere not very good, 25 percent<br />\nthought they were very good,<br />\nand 65 percent expressed no<br />\nopinion\u2014claiming they \"did not<br />\nknow enough\" about such<br />\nactivities as Sunday Experience,<br />\nCatholic CoMmunity on campus,<br />\nor Jewish Student Association.<br />\nWhen asked about the possible<br />\napathy towards organized<br />\nreligion on campus, Dean of<br />\nStudents Robert J. Fitzpatrick<br />\nnoted that perhaps it would be<br />\nan advantage if there were more<br />\nclergymen and rabbis on campus<br /><br />\nwho would be genuinely<br />\ninterested with the students.<br />\n\"I think that the organized<br />\nreligious groups on campus have<br />\nnot been as strong as expected,\"<br />\nFitzpatrick observed.<br />\nAccording to the Office of the<br />\nChaplain, however, over 95% of<br />\nthe incoming freshmen did<br />\nexpress a religious preference on<br />\ntheir applications. The<br />\nbreakdown for the class of 1977<br />\nis as follows: Jewish 40%, Roman<br /><br />\nCatholic 30%, Protestant 25%,<br />\nnon-denominational 5%.<br />\nThe most obvious organized<br />\nreligions group on campus is the<br />\nOffice of the Chaplain. Originally<br />\ndesigned to be primarily a social<br />\nfunction for the University, the<br />\nOffice of the Chaplain has come<br />\nto represent all religions for the<br />\nstudent body.

While it seems a bit odd that the<br />\nprogram has to undergo GUS scrutiny again, it is at least<br />\nreassuring to know that the vote March 7 will come on the<br />\nmerits of the program alone, and not on some extraneous<br />\nissue brought up to serve as a decoy.<br /><br />\nconflict<br />\nThe selection by the Student Council of Sue Matson as<br />\nChairperson of Orientation activities for next fall's<br />\nfreshmen has raised some questions concerning the<br />\nlegitimacy with which the title was earned.<br />\nMatson, herself a member of the committee responsible<br />\nfor nominating her, enjoys the unique position of having<br />\nobtained:<br />\n1) More than adequate versing on the problems of<br />\norganizing and executing an Orientation schedule, thanks to<br />\nattendence at an \"Orientation workshop\" sponsored by the<br />\nDirector of the Union last fall, and<br />\n2) Almost unanimous support from her fellow Student<br />\nCouncil and Selections Committee members concerning her<br />\ndesire to remain on the latter panel despite the possibility<br />\nof conflict of interests on her part.

The set was carefully<br />\nconstructed, consisting of a very<br />\nfew familiar constructions such as<br />\n\"And You And I,\" and \"Close to<br />\nthe Edge\" and excerpts from<br />\norganist Rick Wakeman's \"Six<br />\nWives of Henry VIII.\" For Yes'<br />\nmain purpose this night was to<br />\nintroduce their new album, Tales<br />\nfrom Topographic Oceans.\"<br />\nThe group performed the LP (a<br />\ntwo record set) in its entirity.<br />\nProgressing in the modess of<br />\ncomplexity that Yes seems to<br />\nthrive on, the music was frequently<br />\ndifficult to listen to. In addition to<br />\nthe abstractness of the material,<br />\nthe Civic Center's acoustics<br />\nprevented most of lead vocalist Jon<br />\nAnderson's lyrics from being<br />\nunderstood. Yes' massive sound<br />\nsystem . was also often overbearing<br />\nand the threshold of audible pain<br />\nwas croseed more than once.<br />\nNonetheless, the new material<br />\ndisplayed its moments of extreme<br />\nhigh quality. Guitarist Steve Howe,<br />\nan absolute master of his<br />\ninstrument, played a breathtaking<br />\nclassical solo midway through the<br />\nthird side. On the fourth side (The<br />\nRitual), the group demonstrated its<br />\nability to perform as a tightly<br />\ncalibrated unit. Soaring melody<br />\nand stunning dynamics<br />\n(reminiscent of other English<br />\ngroups like Jethro Tull and King<br />\nCrimson) were used to illustrate<br />\nthe work's fascinating themes of<br />\nsungods, giants, and lost<br />\ncivilizations.

Also,<br />\nthe mini-term has put pressure on<br />\nthe faculty to offer courses,...\"<br /><br />\nI do not wish to take a position<br />\nof direct opposition to Dr.<br />\nSampson's belief(quoted earlier in<br />\nthe article) that \"(the minimester)<br />\n... has no legal approval, and<br />\nshould only be on a voluntary,<br />\nnon-credit system,\" because I feel<br />\ncertain that his ideas are based on<br />\ngood intentions. The minimester is<br />\nan important contrast to the rest<br />\nof the academic year, and its basic<br />\nprinciples (which I presume to be,<br />\nsimply, learning with no ulterior<br />\nmotive except the application of<br />\nwhat's been learned) should be<br />\ncarefolly guarded.<br />\nHowever, as both a full-time<br />\nundergraduate student and a<br />\nteacher of one of the minimester<br />\ncourses, I take as a direct insult<br />\nSampson's contentions that many<br /><br />\nof the minimester courses are<br />\n\"potentially fly-by-night\" and a<br />\nway of obtaining \"extra credits\"<br />\nFurthermore, his insinuation that<br />\nputting pressure on the faculty to<br />\noffer more courses is an<br />\nundesireable thing, is incredibly<br />\nbiasesl. Such a position amounts to<br />\nblatant ignorance of a student's<br />\ndesire to learn. This stance may<br />\nmake for much published paper,<br />\nbut is academically fatal in the<br />\nlong run.<br />\nThe idea of the minimester is to<br />\noffer material that is unobtainable<br />\nduring the regular semester, largely<br />\nbecause of Hopkins'<br />\nhorse-in-blinders approach to<br />\neducation. The credit system is<br />\ndesigned to acknowledge a certain<br />\ndegree of proficiency or skill in<br />\nsome area of endeavor. Note that<br />\nduring the regular term, a science<br />\nmajor receives credit for courses in<br />\nliterature, and vice-versa. That he<br />\nshould not would be an insult to<br />\nboth the respective field of study,<br />\nand the student's own efforts in<br />\nthat field. If an entire institution is<br />\nrun with a credit system, for that<br />\ninstitution not to accredit a course<br />\nto me means that it doesn't want<br />\nto accept responsibility for the<br />\ncourse. Two reasons for not<br />\naccepting this responsibility are:<br />\nthe course is poortly taught; and<br />\nthe course is in some trivial field of<br />\nendeavor. Thus to abolish the<br />\ncredit system during the<br />\nminimester while retaining it for<br />\nthe rest of the academic year is<br />\ntantamount to officially stating<br />\nthat all minimester courses are<br />\neither poorly taught or of trivial<br />\nimportance. To go further this<br />\nimplies that only those courses<br /><br />\ntaught during the regular year are<br />\nmore than trivial importance.<br />\nFinally, since the topics of<br />\nminimester courses are usually not<br />\ntaught during the regular year, Dr.<br />\nSampson's no-credit minimester<br />\ncontends that 11 courses necessary<br />\nto a Hopkins undergraduate, or<br />\ntruly worth his while to take, are<br />\nalready being offered. This is true.<br />\nOh, Come, All ye Robots!<br />\nIt is impossible for anybody to<br />\nacquire \"Extra credits.\" If one<br />\nexceeds the credit requirement for<br />\ngraduation, it's an obvious sign<br />\nthat the student concerned wished<br />\nto take a few courses of his own<br /><br />\nvolition. These courses are just as<br />\nimportant as any the short-sighted,<br />\nshallow and pompous<br />\nadministrations of this or any<br />\nother, university deem as being<br />\n\"necessary\" or \"required for<br />\ngraduation.\" Meanwhile, if this<br />\nstudent is allowed to graduate at<br />\nall it's a sure sign that the<br />\n\"requirements\" were fulfilled<br />\nanyhow. Finally, since in order to<br />\nreceive accreditation of course<br />\nmust go through a minimal amount<br />\nof screening by the University, it<br />\nwouldn't be a bad idea at all if all<br />\nminimester courses were given only<br />\nfor credit The screening involved<br /><br />\nwould insure that the University's<br />\nfacilities were being used as<br />\nthoroughly and as intelligently as<br />\npossible.<br />\nSome of my opinions, if<br />\npublished, will I'm sure be amply<br />\nserviced by cries such as<br />\n\"Arrogance\" or \"Immaturity\" or<br />\n\"The Guy Must Need a Haircut!\"<br />\nIn anticipation of these, I'll<br />\nrespond right now. I've received<br />\nenough haircuts while at Hopkins,<br />\nfrom short-sighted and<br />\nself-important people, but I've also<br />\nbeen graced with the finest<br />\nteachers, friends, and<br />\nacquaintances I've ever known,<br /><br />\nFive words<br />\nTo the Editor:<br />\nFrank Comfort said it all in five<br />\nwords: \"The university exists for<br />\nstudents...\"<br />\nIt's good to know there are two<br />\nof us around who believe that. .<br />\nRuth Read<br />\nDirector of<br />\nSudent Employment Service<br /><br />\nofotiVrjj<br /><br />\nNEWS4Erret<br /><br />\nla\u2022t1C -7<br />\narrXi<br />\nI<br /><br />\nvrx:. alcoRkw\u201e__<br />\nr<br />\n\u2022.1\"1 foo\u2022<br /><br />\nvseP .4;<br /><br />\nv<br /><br />\n\u2022<br /><br />\n'DEAR MR.

Dr. Chester<br />\nWickwire, who is the official<br />\nChaplain of the University, has<br />\nbeen at Hopkins since the fall of<br />\n1952. Once the sole social<br />\nprogrammer of Hopkins.<br />\nWickwire was the man who<br />\norganized the famous concert<br />\nthat Duke Ellington had at<br />\nHopkins in the '50's.

The new Student<br />\ncouncil office was once the<br />\nUniversity's chapel.<br />\n\"We consider religion in a<br />\nbroader sense. Our feeling is that<br />\nreligion involves total worship<br />\nand not concentrating on any<br />\none aspect or area. I think that<br />\nwhat we try to do is humanize<br />\nthe campus. In an age of<br />\nbureaucratization one needs<br />\nencouragement in humanizing<br />\nthe scene,\" said Wickwire.<br />\n\"For example, our Sunday<br />\nmorning experience is not religous<br />\nin the strict sense where we have<br />\nreadings and prayers. At the<br />\nexperience we discuss aspects of<br />\nlife in general and attempt to<br />\nbring together individuals from<br />\nthe community of Baltimore and<br />\nthe campus. It is a place where<br />\nyou are able to speak out and be<br />\nheard. Also, our tutoring<br />\nprogram allows students to help<br />\npersons and give those persons a<br />\nunique one-to-one<br />\ncorrespondence with the<br />\nstudents. The tutorial service<br />\nprobably makes better citizens<br />\nand makes more persons aware of<br />\nreal problems,\" said Wickwire.<br />\nAmong the other activities<br />\nwhich the Office of the Chaplain<br />\nsponsors, is the course on<br />\nJuvenile Delinquency.<br />\n\"This is another program<br /><br />\nwhich attempts to make a<br />\none-to-one correspondence<br />\nbetween students and<br />\ncommunity. We feel that both<br />\nthe clients and the students are<br />\nhelped, and grow in a mature<br />\nfashion,\" added Wickwire.<br />\nIn addition, there are classes in<br />\nIssues in Health Care, and a<br />\ncourse on comparative religion.<br />\nThere is also the Free University,<br />\nwhich conducts classes in the<br />\narea of religion, yoga, the occult,<br />\nand other diversified areas of<br />\ninterest.<br />\nAlso, the Office of the<br />\nChaplain holds luncheons with<br />\nguest speakers, and sponsors field<br />\ntrips to Washington to observe<br />\nthe services of other religions,<br />\nsuch as Hinduism and Bhuddism.<br />\n\"In March we will present a<br />\nconcert with the choir of the St.<br />\nFrancis Xavier Church, and later<br />\nin the year we will also have<br />\nsome special guest lecturers, such<br />\nas .Dr. Harvey Cox,\" said<br />\nWickwire.<br />\n\"Finally, on November 7,<br />\n1974, there will be an<br />\nInter-Denominational Alliance<br />\nmeeting with Dr. Muller as a<br />\nspeaker,\" added Wickwire.<br />\nWickwire has been the official<br />\nchaplain for Hopkins for the last<br />\n21 years. As chaplain of the<br />\nUniversity he has also performed<br />\nweddings, addressed the<br />\ngraduating class on<br />\nCommemoration Day, and has<br />\neven been asked to perform a few<br />\nexorcisms.
