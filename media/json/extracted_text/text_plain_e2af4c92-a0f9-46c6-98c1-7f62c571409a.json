McCarthy. The<br />\nstudents, from Johns Hopkins,<br />\nGoucher, Mt. St. Agnes, Peabody<br />\nConservatory, Morgan State, and<br />\nthree local high schools, were part<br />\nof a larger group which travelled<br />\nin three buses from the Washington-Baltimore area under the sponsorship of McCarthy for President<br />\nvNational Headquarters.<br />\nAfter a twelve-hour bus trip<br />\nte<br />\nWhich included an unscheduled<br />\nhour-long guided tour of Boston,<br />\nthe campaigners arrived in Manechester, New Hampshire. They<br />\nswere immediately divided into two<br />\nar<br />\ngroups relating to respectability<br />\nin<br />\nof appearance, the former allowed<br />\nto canvass, the latter relegated to<br />\nly<br />\nsecretarial duties.<br />\npThe two groups were further<br />\nnsubdivided as to which city they<br />\nwould work in. The majority re)e<br />\nmained in Manchester while smalto<br />\nler teams were sent north to Con,e- cord and Berlin.<br />\nPt<br />\nEarly results, notably from Berle- lin, a mill town of 17,000, gave<br />\nrise to unprecedented optimisism<br />\nTIand indications were that a 40%<br />\nue<br />\nMcCarthy vote was not impossible.<br />\nhe<br />\nEarlier hopes had been for a 15le- 20% turnout for the Senator.<br />\nLnThe canvassers, going from<br />\nad<br />\nhouse to house, used a one to five<br />\niii- scale to rate the political leanings<br />\nin- of the people.

Both of these groups have<br />\nadopted the attitude that the<br />\nVECTOR should be self-supporting or it should close shop.<br />\nThe VECTOR editors have concluded that their only alternative<br />\nin the face of the university's policy is to publish only two issues<br />\nnext year and use the rest of their<br />\nfunds to absolve the present debts.<br />\nIn the 1969-70 academic year,<br />\n<br />\nthe magazine could attempt to return to publication on a quarterly<br />\nbasis, but it seems doubtful that<br />\nit could become self-sustaining.<br />\nAs Polnitsky explained in his<br />\nletter to Mr. Bilgrave, the VECTOR'S problems began when the<br />\n\"School of Engineering Science\"<br />\nwas dissolved as a distinct entity.<br />\nAt that time the magazine's appeal<br />\nwas only to engineering students.<br />\nHowever, beginning with the<br />\nNovember, 1966 issue, the editors<br />\nand staff of the VECTOR attempted to convert the old magazine into a publication which would focus on \"the technical aspects of<br />\nthe sciences and on the arts.\" The<br />\neditors believed that in its new format the VECTOR would be relevant to the entire Hopkins community and would add a necessary<br />\ndimension to the university's life.<br />\nThe response of the faculty and<br />\nstudents to the new issues was<br />\n<br />\nhighly favorable.<br />\nNevertheless, the VECTOR<br />\ncould not support itself because<br />\nits new format caused a significant<br />\nincrease in the costs of publication. In addition, problems arose<br />\nwith subscriptions and advertising.<br />\nPolnitsky admitted that some of<br />\nthese problems could be blamed<br />\non the VECTOR'S staff, but the<br />\nentire editorial staff agreed that<br />\nthe magazine could not maintain<br />\nor improve its present quality<br />\nwithout incuring some financial<br />\ndifficulties.<br />\nOn February 20th, the editors<br />\nof the VECTOR met and decided<br />\nto recommend to the SAC that the<br />\nmagazine be phased out if the university would not reconsider its<br />\npolicy. The editors said that they<br />\nwould not be willing to compromise the VECTOR'S standards in<br />\norder to cut costs and issue a<br />\nmagazine of average quality.<br />\n<br />\nPssst.<br />\nWanna buy a revealing glimpse<br />\nof student life in Europe for a buck?<br />\n<br />\n/ill<br />\n<br />\n* * *<br />\n<br />\nat<br />\n!ak<br />\nof<br />\nIer<br />\nto<br />\n<br />\n1<br />\n<br />\nSubmarines\u2022 Pizza<br />\nSPaghetti\u2022 Chicken Dinners<br />\n<br />\nHARRY LITTLE<br />\nCARRY OUT SHOPS<br />\n<br />\n32nd Near Greenmount<br />\n25th Near Greenmount<br />\nYork Road & Regester Ave.<br />\n<br />\n\u2022<br />\n<br />\nListen.

Cause<br />\nof death was attributed to lack of funds and obstructionist policies<br />\nof the SAC and the Office of Student Affairs.<br />\nThe Vector lived up to its name. It showed direction and magnitude of force, to use the mathematical idiom, in showing that scientists are also artists. Unfortunately the boys who control the money<br />\nfor the Vector didn't get the message.The Vector was to be a moneymaking business. It failed to make money miserably, thanks to the<br />\napathy of students, alumni, and particularly the faculty.<br />\nSince life means little after death, we expect that the Vector will<br />\npass away with as little stir as did Bessie Smith. Perhaps a few observations on the profit motive at Hopkins would be a fitting epitaph<br />\nfor the Vector.<br />\nIt appears that those concerned with college as a profit theory of<br />\neducation have a fixation on balanced budgets to the detriment of<br />\nmany fine programs. The Vector is an example. It was run by students who spent time and energy to make the magazine. They were<br />\nnot paid.<br />\nAt the same time the student editors of the Vector gave Hopkins a<br />\nfine product that could contribute to the community of scholars<br />\nthat hangs out around here. The rub was that they were not making<br />\nenough money. Now we hear vague threats by the money givers that<br />\nsuch \"irresponsibility\" must be punished. Small wonder students get<br />\nbitter.<br />\nWouldn't it have been better, dear SAC and Office of Student<br />\nAffairs, that Hopkins would lose some money and retain the Vector,<br />\nits staff, and the contribution it gave to the search for truth?<br />\nBut maybe we are at fault. Maybe we don't see the light. Maybe<br />\nHopkins is here to make money.<br />\n<br />\nA Time to Act<br />\nIt seems that something has finally touched the Hopkins student<br />\nstrongly enough to make him act. This is rare in a university such as<br />\nHopkins,a university which hasconsistently prided itself on its ability<br />\nto turn men out into the world who are devoted to the search for<br />\ntruth. In the recent past, however, this search for truth has seemed<br />\nmore a search for the status quo, stability and middle of the road<br />\nreasonableness. Now, with the pressure of the draft threatening most<br />\nstudents, many people here are relinquishing bland acceptance of<br />\ngovernmental policy, and putting in its place plans for protest and<br />\nconfrontation.<br />\nIt is good that many Hopkins students are finally being moved out<br />\nof bland complacency, for it will draw a vastly large chorus of dissent among a substantial group of students. With the threat of fighting, and not merely observing, war, many students are, for the first<br />\ntime, seriously considering the impact Johnson's war may have on<br />\ntheir own lives. They are finally beginning to realize that the inane<br />\nand in vain war is not worth their lives, and therefore not worth the<br />\nlife of any other American. Students are talking more about the war,<br />\nand they are beginning to see only two alternatives: to fight, o; to<br />\ndefy_ the law. lit is becoming clear to many, that the latter choice is<br />\nthe only way to bring this senseless war to an end; only when Johnson,or whoever else is in his position,realizes the very great crisis the<br />\nwar is bringing into the well being of the nation, will the war itself<br />\nend.<br />\nStudent power has been much discussed. In the realm of academic<br />\nadministration, it may not have much promise; but concerning the<br />\nwar it is vitally important. Students cannot sway Washington with<br />\nletters and other forms of \"democratic channels\" protest, but they<br />\ncan throw the nation and the war's leaders into total and irretrievable<br />\nconfusion by a mass refusal to serve in a useless struggle when they<br />\nare called up in July. Then it is the student who is on the offensive,<br />\nand the Washington bureaucracy is put in the position of having to<br />\ndecide its alternatives - - jail the students, change the system, or stop<br />\nthe war. This, admittedly, is a simplistic analysis of the situation<br />\nwhich a confrontation may bring, but basically it is not far from the<br />\ntruth.<br />\nThe News-Letter is distributing a poll on the draft today to every<br />\nstudent at Hopkins. We are trying to find just how serious the situation is, and what students here would be willing to do in the event of<br />\nbeing called. It is important that everyone respond to the survey and<br />\nreturn them as soon as possible. It is vital that every concerned person here become involved in the debate over the war, and over the<br />\ndraft, one way or the other. Those who are safe from the draft, but<br />\nare nevertheless opposed to the war, are obliged to take a stand.<br />\nMany journals have recently suggested that students are more hawkish<br />\nthan generally believed; we believe, and sincerely hope, that this is<br />\nnot the case. We expect our survey to show us, and Hopkins students,<br />\nwhether it is true or not. The full results will be published with comment in next week's News-Letter.<br />\n<br />\nr<br />\n<br />\nHOMEWOOD,BALTIMORE, MARCH L68<br />\n<br />\n-Tlying Nova In the Streets<br />\n<br />\nBy BILL SAKOWICH<br />\nI met a dear man tonight.<br />\nHe was Dr. Griswold Taylor,<br />\nand he was eating a cold cut submarine, and had a dapper white<br />\nmoustache.<br />\nAnd he was drunk.<br />\nI had the opportunity with two<br />\nof my friends, while we were finding something to eat after a harrowing round of fraternity fun.<br />\nFor five hours, we had partaken of<br />\nfoamy beer, nameless nametags,<br />\nHow do you do, will you dance?,<br />\nput-ups, shoot-downs, disheartening cold shoulders, HEY!, chug<br />\ncontests,sign stealings, and buddy,<br />\nyou fit right in here.<br />\nWell, was that a night. Frat<br />\nmen, for that matter, all of us, are<br />\ndifferent from Dr. Taylor. Here we<br />\nare, college students, men of the<br />\nworld. Molded of sunlight we are,<br />\nas if someone grabbed a fiery ball<br />\nof sun matter, and shaped us, and<br />\nfloated us down in human form.<br />\nWe may shine as brightly as a<br />\nBetelgeuse, but we still have the<br />\nconsistency of light.<br />\nDr. Taylor is of the opposite<br />\nsort. He is burning cinder of a<br />\nonce bright star, that is now cold<br />\nand rests on a throne of mud.<br />\nAnyway, we had had it, and<br />\nwanted something to eat, which<br />\nwas our common ground for the<br />\nevening. Dr. Taylor, for his part,<br />\nwas an inebriated, sputtering ember.<br />\nBut solid, real, something that<br />\nwe could touch. without getting<br />\nburned.<br />\nHe came up to us, and muttered something in Spanish, and then<br />\nsomething again as quickly in<br />\nFrench. We muttered something in<br />\nRussian. The doctor replied in<br />\nPolish. Then he told us in English<br />\nthat he was a Welshman.<br />\n\"GodsavethequeenGodblestheu<br />\nnitedstatesofamericaaaa .\"<br />\n<br />\nThat's what he said. He wanted<br />\nto know about us, our majors, the<br />\nnew generation of sun people. He<br />\nasked about our studies, and our<br />\ninterests. He wanted to know us,<br />\nbut only because then we would<br />\nknow him, and hopefully admire<br />\nhim. Dr. Taylor didn't need us. He<br />\nneeded the person that was himself ten years ago, which had long<br />\nbeen buried.<br />\nFriendly, though. He knew of<br />\nBeta Theta Pi and wanted us to<br />\ntake him there to get more drunk.<br />\n\"Let us take my libation and go<br />\nto Bettta Thetaaa Ppi, on Caunterburrry road. You know of the<br />\nplace?\"<br />\nWe did. We laughed.<br />\nWe asked ourselves what we<br />\nwere going to do with this man.<br />\nOr what he was going to do with<br />\nus.<br />\nHe was a surgeon, and knew<br />\nabout appendectomies, and one of<br />\nus said his father was a surgeon<br />\ntoo, though he really was an ornithologist.<br />\nThe three of us weren't quite<br />\nsure what to do, as we staggered<br />\nacross the street, dodging patronizing cars, and straddling the two<br />\nubiquitious yellow lines that<br />\nstretch forever down the world's<br />\nhighways. At the other side, we<br />\nlooked back to see the doctor following us. He strode across the<br />\nstreet, smiling and munching, and<br />\nholding a cigarette that was about<br />\nto go out.<br />\nIt seems that he works now for<br />\nHopkins at the Sinai Hospital. At<br />\nany rate, he was once a medical<br />\nprofessor at Maryland, and had<br />\ndone well before a hitch in the<br />\nRoyal Navy. After telling us that<br />\nhe was affectionately known as<br />\nthe \"butcher\", and after giving us<br />\nsome vicarious delights in the descriptions of his operating room<br />\n<br />\ntechnique, the doctor pulled ou<br />\nan old reprint of a Maryland med<br />\ncal journal, which he fondled ar<br />\nunfolded carefully. Boldfaced, ar<br />\nat the top was the name - It was hard to believe that tilt<br />\nwere the same man. The piec<br />\nwhich seemed to have been occ<br />\nsioned by Taylor's retirement<br />\nresignation, was obviously writt<br />\nby a man who held the doctor<br />\ngreat esteem. It was his wish th<br />\nhe should read the best part to i.<br />\nWe smiled to ourselves, for<br />\nwere no longer afraid of him, a<br />\nlet him read of how noble a m<br />\nhe was, and what a pursuer of tr<br />\nright and the honest he was, atl,<br />\nhow he shall trod the steadfal<br />\nway for the rest of his life as<br />\nhad always done.<br />\nWe shook hands there on<br />\ncorner, each of us wishing<br />\nwell, and he gave us some ft<br />\nadvice \u2014<br />\n\"Keep up with your studiel<br />\nand give it one hell of a shot.\"<br />\nHe smiled at us with rottel<br />\nteeth, and watched, glowing fain<br />\nly now, as we walked into the<br />\nher glare of a stoplight.<br />\nDr. Griswold Taylor was out<br />\nour lives as quickly as he had be<br />\nin them. Into our separate univer<br />\nnear Charles St. had come<br />\nalien in Coventry, an intruder,<br />\nfallen angel adjusting his ha<br />\nusing us as a mirror.<br />\nI know that somewhere, ri<br />\nknow Dr. Griswold Taylor is sle<br />\ning, I hope peacefully. It may<br />\nin a gutter on Greenmount Aven<br />\nin his own sickness, it may be<br />\nthe basement of the city dru<br />\ntank, or he may be in his o<br />\nlonely room, spinning around<br />\nhis own dreams, trying to th2<br />\nout his frozen ego.

He doesn't know it, but the border guard<br />\nsits chatting with a Mountie, the<br />\nMountie exclaiming that he never<br />\nthought it would come to this.<br />\n\"But these boys have their<br />\nrights,\" the guard interposed.\"Hell<br />\nmy grandfather came to Canada to<br />\nget out of the army in Europe.<br />\nHe stopped in Quebec, but had he<br />\ngone on to New York I might be<br />\none of those guys.\"<br />\nHe never thought it would<br />\ncome to this. All right, he knew<br />\nthe deferment wouldn't last forever. But these things just don't<br />\nhappen. Like war. And he had<br />\nplanned to explain it to them<br />\ncarefully, these beliefs he had and<br />\nthey would have to listen.<br />\n\"I'll ask you one more time.<br />\nWhat would you do if someone<br />\nattacked your mother and you<br />\nwere the only one around?\"<br />\n\"I don't know.

But it's your duty as a<br />\nman to defend your country and<br />\nyour way of life.\"<br />\n\"I'm a human being first,\" lie<br />\nhad answered very calmly and he<br />\nbelieved in a small way heroically.<br />\n\"I'm a human being first.\"<br />\n\"Look, let's be adults about<br />\nthis,\" replied the Mountie.\"Whether its good or bad or right or<br />\nwrong, every human being on this<br />\n<br />\nearth owes his loyalty to some<br />\nnation.

CONCERNED<br />\nEditors:<br />\nTo the<br />\nThe recent evolution of Selective Service policy is a cause of<br />\ngrave concern to us. We consider<br />\nits recent re-interpretation and the<br />\nresultant policy, especially with<br />\nregard to graduate school deferments, to be misdirected and dangerously harmful to universities in<br />\ngeneral and ours, Johns Hopkins,<br />\nin particular.<br />\nThe basis for our discontent is<br />\ngreat. Under the new system, we<br />\nstand much to lose: revenues, quality students, quality instructors,<br />\nand quality instruction. We have<br />\nnothing to gain. We hasten to<br />\npoint out that our loss here at the<br />\nUniversity is also the loss of society, and it is a loss that society<br />\ncan ill afford in times so filled with<br />\ntension and so prone to crisis. Ours<br />\n<br />\nis a time of promises as well as tension though, and this adds to our<br />\nconfusion and misbelief that our<br />\ngovernment can channel the essence that is the promise of the<br />\nfuture so wantonly and so blatantly away from its rightful place and<br />\ntask: the pursuit of excellence in<br />\nan atmosphere of openness.<br />\nThe President of the United<br />\nStates and the Director of the<br />\nSelective Service have temporarily<br />\nfinalized this new status of draft<br />\npolicy.

We, therefore, submit to<br />\nyou our urgent plea to review the<br />\nrecent developments and policy revisions, to speak out against them<br />\nand for a system that gives the<br />\ndeserved recognition to the peculiar status of our graduate schools<br />\nand their students, and to work<br />\n<br />\nactively to revise the current in- sented as a distillation of \"the<br />\nequitable, misconceived, and self- Hopkins experience\".

Combined with inadequate education and<br />\nlimited opportunity, this instability gives the Negro a sense of inferiority, blocking him from social<br />\nand economic advancement.<br />\nThe report further stated that a<br />\nmassive federal program was needed to alleviate conditions in the<br />\nghetto.

McCarthy. The<br />\nstudents, from Johns Hopkins,<br />\nGoucher, Mt. St. Agnes, Peabody<br />\nConservatory, Morgan State, and<br />\nthree local high schools, were part<br />\nof a larger group which travelled<br />\nin three buses from the Washington-Baltimore area under the sponsorship of McCarthy for President<br />\nvNational Headquarters.<br />\nAfter a twelve-hour bus trip<br />\nte<br />\nWhich included an unscheduled<br />\nhour-long guided tour of Boston,<br />\nthe campaigners arrived in Manechester, New Hampshire. They<br />\nswere immediately divided into two<br />\nar<br />\ngroups relating to respectability<br />\nin<br />\nof appearance, the former allowed<br />\nto canvass, the latter relegated to<br />\nly<br />\nsecretarial duties.<br />\npThe two groups were further<br />\nnsubdivided as to which city they<br />\nwould work in. The majority re)e<br />\nmained in Manchester while smalto<br />\nler teams were sent north to Con,e- cord and Berlin.<br />\nPt<br />\nEarly results, notably from Berle- lin, a mill town of 17,000, gave<br />\nrise to unprecedented optimisism<br />\nTIand indications were that a 40%<br />\nue<br />\nMcCarthy vote was not impossible.<br />\nhe<br />\nEarlier hopes had been for a 15le- 20% turnout for the Senator.<br />\nLnThe canvassers, going from<br />\nad<br />\nhouse to house, used a one to five<br />\niii- scale to rate the political leanings<br />\nin- of the people. Undaunted by those<br />\nial who though that McCarthy was<br />\nrunning for Vice-President with<br />\nt a Johnson and those who declared<br />\n!d- their support for Nixon in the<br />\nhe Democratic Primary, the students<br />\n/as determined that approximately<br />\nm- 35-40% of the people were in the<br />\nrn- two most-favorable-to-McCarthy<br />\nor<br />\ncategories. A significant 45% were<br />\nro- rated \"undecided.\"<br />\nThe canvassers, armed with<br />\nnews briefs and leaflets detailing<br />\nthe Senator's position on key election issues, used as an opening<br />\ngambit McCarthy's oft-stated slopn of his offering the people<br />\na<br />\nPositive alternative to President<br />\nJ ohnson's policies.\"<br />\nThe use of large numbers of<br />\nint<br />\nay out-of-state students as canvassers<br />\nm. had not been tried before in the<br />\nlor Campaign, and the move was<br />\nfill watched closely for its effect upon<br />\nhe the .ultra-conservative New Hamptk- shirites. Campaign leaders rated the<br />\n'nt experiment an unqualified success.<br />\nThe students, too, were pleased<br />\nWith the results and commented<br />\npa.rticula<br />\nrly<br />\nf_riendline upon the \"universal<br />\nss\" of the \"natives.\"<br />\n)te ,theY were often invited into<br />\nnorms to talk and recover from<br />\nnt- thC<br />\nbitter cold and wind.<br />\nits<br />\nMost<br />\nof the students brought<br />\nler ' sle<br />\nePing bags and were rewarded<br />\nfor their foresight with the hard,<br />\nrse<br />\nraiter<br />\n'an<br />\nW HYCOMPROMISE..<br />\nge,<br />\n.

Both of these groups have<br />\nadopted the attitude that the<br />\nVECTOR should be self-supporting or it should close shop.<br />\nThe VECTOR editors have concluded that their only alternative<br />\nin the face of the university's policy is to publish only two issues<br />\nnext year and use the rest of their<br />\nfunds to absolve the present debts.<br />\nIn the 1969-70 academic year,<br /><br />\nthe magazine could attempt to return to publication on a quarterly<br />\nbasis, but it seems doubtful that<br />\nit could become self-sustaining.<br />\nAs Polnitsky explained in his<br />\nletter to Mr. Bilgrave, the VECTOR'S problems began when the<br />\n\"School of Engineering Science\"<br />\nwas dissolved as a distinct entity.<br />\nAt that time the magazine's appeal<br />\nwas only to engineering students.<br />\nHowever, beginning with the<br />\nNovember, 1966 issue, the editors<br />\nand staff of the VECTOR attempted to convert the old magazine into a publication which would focus on \"the technical aspects of<br />\nthe sciences and on the arts.\" The<br />\neditors believed that in its new format the VECTOR would be relevant to the entire Hopkins community and would add a necessary<br />\ndimension to the university's life.<br />\nThe response of the faculty and<br />\nstudents to the new issues was<br /><br />\nhighly favorable.<br />\nNevertheless, the VECTOR<br />\ncould not support itself because<br />\nits new format caused a significant<br />\nincrease in the costs of publication. In addition, problems arose<br />\nwith subscriptions and advertising.<br />\nPolnitsky admitted that some of<br />\nthese problems could be blamed<br />\non the VECTOR'S staff, but the<br />\nentire editorial staff agreed that<br />\nthe magazine could not maintain<br />\nor improve its present quality<br />\nwithout incuring some financial<br />\ndifficulties.<br />\nOn February 20th, the editors<br />\nof the VECTOR met and decided<br />\nto recommend to the SAC that the<br />\nmagazine be phased out if the university would not reconsider its<br />\npolicy. The editors said that they<br />\nwould not be willing to compromise the VECTOR'S standards in<br />\norder to cut costs and issue a<br />\nmagazine of average quality.<br /><br />\nPssst.<br />\nWanna buy a revealing glimpse<br />\nof student life in Europe for a buck?<br /><br />\n/ill<br /><br />\n* * *<br /><br />\nat<br />\n!ak<br />\nof<br />\nIer<br />\nto<br /><br />\n1<br /><br />\nSubmarines\u2022 Pizza<br />\nSPaghetti\u2022 Chicken Dinners<br /><br />\nHARRY LITTLE<br />\nCARRY OUT SHOPS<br /><br />\n32nd Near Greenmount<br />\n25th Near Greenmount<br />\nYork Road &amp; Regester Ave.<br /><br />\n\u2022<br /><br />\nListen.

Cause<br />\nof death was attributed to lack of funds and obstructionist policies<br />\nof the SAC and the Office of Student Affairs.<br />\nThe Vector lived up to its name. It showed direction and magnitude of force, to use the mathematical idiom, in showing that scientists are also artists. Unfortunately the boys who control the money<br />\nfor the Vector didn't get the message.The Vector was to be a moneymaking business. It failed to make money miserably, thanks to the<br />\napathy of students, alumni, and particularly the faculty.<br />\nSince life means little after death, we expect that the Vector will<br />\npass away with as little stir as did Bessie Smith. Perhaps a few observations on the profit motive at Hopkins would be a fitting epitaph<br />\nfor the Vector.<br />\nIt appears that those concerned with college as a profit theory of<br />\neducation have a fixation on balanced budgets to the detriment of<br />\nmany fine programs. The Vector is an example. It was run by students who spent time and energy to make the magazine. They were<br />\nnot paid.<br />\nAt the same time the student editors of the Vector gave Hopkins a<br />\nfine product that could contribute to the community of scholars<br />\nthat hangs out around here. The rub was that they were not making<br />\nenough money. Now we hear vague threats by the money givers that<br />\nsuch \"irresponsibility\" must be punished. Small wonder students get<br />\nbitter.<br />\nWouldn't it have been better, dear SAC and Office of Student<br />\nAffairs, that Hopkins would lose some money and retain the Vector,<br />\nits staff, and the contribution it gave to the search for truth?<br />\nBut maybe we are at fault. Maybe we don't see the light. Maybe<br />\nHopkins is here to make money.<br /><br />\nA Time to Act<br />\nIt seems that something has finally touched the Hopkins student<br />\nstrongly enough to make him act. This is rare in a university such as<br />\nHopkins,a university which hasconsistently prided itself on its ability<br />\nto turn men out into the world who are devoted to the search for<br />\ntruth. In the recent past, however, this search for truth has seemed<br />\nmore a search for the status quo, stability and middle of the road<br />\nreasonableness. Now, with the pressure of the draft threatening most<br />\nstudents, many people here are relinquishing bland acceptance of<br />\ngovernmental policy, and putting in its place plans for protest and<br />\nconfrontation.<br />\nIt is good that many Hopkins students are finally being moved out<br />\nof bland complacency, for it will draw a vastly large chorus of dissent among a substantial group of students. With the threat of fighting, and not merely observing, war, many students are, for the first<br />\ntime, seriously considering the impact Johnson's war may have on<br />\ntheir own lives. They are finally beginning to realize that the inane<br />\nand in vain war is not worth their lives, and therefore not worth the<br />\nlife of any other American. Students are talking more about the war,<br />\nand they are beginning to see only two alternatives: to fight, o; to<br />\ndefy_ the law. lit is becoming clear to many, that the latter choice is<br />\nthe only way to bring this senseless war to an end; only when Johnson,or whoever else is in his position,realizes the very great crisis the<br />\nwar is bringing into the well being of the nation, will the war itself<br />\nend.<br />\nStudent power has been much discussed. In the realm of academic<br />\nadministration, it may not have much promise; but concerning the<br />\nwar it is vitally important. Students cannot sway Washington with<br />\nletters and other forms of \"democratic channels\" protest, but they<br />\ncan throw the nation and the war's leaders into total and irretrievable<br />\nconfusion by a mass refusal to serve in a useless struggle when they<br />\nare called up in July. Then it is the student who is on the offensive,<br />\nand the Washington bureaucracy is put in the position of having to<br />\ndecide its alternatives - - jail the students, change the system, or stop<br />\nthe war. This, admittedly, is a simplistic analysis of the situation<br />\nwhich a confrontation may bring, but basically it is not far from the<br />\ntruth.<br />\nThe News-Letter is distributing a poll on the draft today to every<br />\nstudent at Hopkins. We are trying to find just how serious the situation is, and what students here would be willing to do in the event of<br />\nbeing called. It is important that everyone respond to the survey and<br />\nreturn them as soon as possible. It is vital that every concerned person here become involved in the debate over the war, and over the<br />\ndraft, one way or the other. Those who are safe from the draft, but<br />\nare nevertheless opposed to the war, are obliged to take a stand.<br />\nMany journals have recently suggested that students are more hawkish<br />\nthan generally believed; we believe, and sincerely hope, that this is<br />\nnot the case. We expect our survey to show us, and Hopkins students,<br />\nwhether it is true or not. The full results will be published with comment in next week's News-Letter.<br /><br />\nr<br /><br />\nHOMEWOOD,BALTIMORE, MARCH L68<br /><br />\n-Tlying Nova In the Streets<br /><br />\nBy BILL SAKOWICH<br />\nI met a dear man tonight.<br />\nHe was Dr. Griswold Taylor,<br />\nand he was eating a cold cut submarine, and had a dapper white<br />\nmoustache.<br />\nAnd he was drunk.<br />\nI had the opportunity with two<br />\nof my friends, while we were finding something to eat after a harrowing round of fraternity fun.<br />\nFor five hours, we had partaken of<br />\nfoamy beer, nameless nametags,<br />\nHow do you do, will you dance?,<br />\nput-ups, shoot-downs, disheartening cold shoulders, HEY!, chug<br />\ncontests,sign stealings, and buddy,<br />\nyou fit right in here.<br />\nWell, was that a night. Frat<br />\nmen, for that matter, all of us, are<br />\ndifferent from Dr. Taylor. Here we<br />\nare, college students, men of the<br />\nworld. Molded of sunlight we are,<br />\nas if someone grabbed a fiery ball<br />\nof sun matter, and shaped us, and<br />\nfloated us down in human form.<br />\nWe may shine as brightly as a<br />\nBetelgeuse, but we still have the<br />\nconsistency of light.<br />\nDr. Taylor is of the opposite<br />\nsort. He is burning cinder of a<br />\nonce bright star, that is now cold<br />\nand rests on a throne of mud.<br />\nAnyway, we had had it, and<br />\nwanted something to eat, which<br />\nwas our common ground for the<br />\nevening. Dr. Taylor, for his part,<br />\nwas an inebriated, sputtering ember.<br />\nBut solid, real, something that<br />\nwe could touch. without getting<br />\nburned.<br />\nHe came up to us, and muttered something in Spanish, and then<br />\nsomething again as quickly in<br />\nFrench. We muttered something in<br />\nRussian. The doctor replied in<br />\nPolish. Then he told us in English<br />\nthat he was a Welshman.<br />\n\"GodsavethequeenGodblestheu<br />\nnitedstatesofamericaaaa .\"<br /><br />\nThat's what he said. He wanted<br />\nto know about us, our majors, the<br />\nnew generation of sun people. He<br />\nasked about our studies, and our<br />\ninterests. He wanted to know us,<br />\nbut only because then we would<br />\nknow him, and hopefully admire<br />\nhim. Dr. Taylor didn't need us. He<br />\nneeded the person that was himself ten years ago, which had long<br />\nbeen buried.<br />\nFriendly, though. He knew of<br />\nBeta Theta Pi and wanted us to<br />\ntake him there to get more drunk.<br />\n\"Let us take my libation and go<br />\nto Bettta Thetaaa Ppi, on Caunterburrry road. You know of the<br />\nplace?\"<br />\nWe did. We laughed.<br />\nWe asked ourselves what we<br />\nwere going to do with this man.<br />\nOr what he was going to do with<br />\nus.<br />\nHe was a surgeon, and knew<br />\nabout appendectomies, and one of<br />\nus said his father was a surgeon<br />\ntoo, though he really was an ornithologist.<br />\nThe three of us weren't quite<br />\nsure what to do, as we staggered<br />\nacross the street, dodging patronizing cars, and straddling the two<br />\nubiquitious yellow lines that<br />\nstretch forever down the world's<br />\nhighways. At the other side, we<br />\nlooked back to see the doctor following us. He strode across the<br />\nstreet, smiling and munching, and<br />\nholding a cigarette that was about<br />\nto go out.<br />\nIt seems that he works now for<br />\nHopkins at the Sinai Hospital. At<br />\nany rate, he was once a medical<br />\nprofessor at Maryland, and had<br />\ndone well before a hitch in the<br />\nRoyal Navy. After telling us that<br />\nhe was affectionately known as<br />\nthe \"butcher\", and after giving us<br />\nsome vicarious delights in the descriptions of his operating room<br /><br />\ntechnique, the doctor pulled ou<br />\nan old reprint of a Maryland med<br />\ncal journal, which he fondled ar<br />\nunfolded carefully. Boldfaced, ar<br />\nat the top was the name - It was hard to believe that tilt<br />\nwere the same man. The piec<br />\nwhich seemed to have been occ<br />\nsioned by Taylor's retirement<br />\nresignation, was obviously writt<br />\nby a man who held the doctor<br />\ngreat esteem. It was his wish th<br />\nhe should read the best part to i.<br />\nWe smiled to ourselves, for<br />\nwere no longer afraid of him, a<br />\nlet him read of how noble a m<br />\nhe was, and what a pursuer of tr<br />\nright and the honest he was, atl,<br />\nhow he shall trod the steadfal<br />\nway for the rest of his life as<br />\nhad always done.<br />\nWe shook hands there on<br />\ncorner, each of us wishing<br />\nwell, and he gave us some ft<br />\nadvice \u2014<br />\n\"Keep up with your studiel<br />\nand give it one hell of a shot.\"<br />\nHe smiled at us with rottel<br />\nteeth, and watched, glowing fain<br />\nly now, as we walked into the<br />\nher glare of a stoplight.<br />\nDr. Griswold Taylor was out<br />\nour lives as quickly as he had be<br />\nin them. Into our separate univer<br />\nnear Charles St. had come<br />\nalien in Coventry, an intruder,<br />\nfallen angel adjusting his ha<br />\nusing us as a mirror.<br />\nI know that somewhere, ri<br />\nknow Dr. Griswold Taylor is sle<br />\ning, I hope peacefully. It may<br />\nin a gutter on Greenmount Aven<br />\nin his own sickness, it may be<br />\nthe basement of the city dru<br />\ntank, or he may be in his o<br />\nlonely room, spinning around<br />\nhis own dreams, trying to th2<br />\nout his frozen ego.
