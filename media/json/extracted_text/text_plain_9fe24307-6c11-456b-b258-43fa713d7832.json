Although the Jays<br />\nfloored a team averaging 6'2\",<br />\nthey were not able to exploit their<br />\nheight in the control of the backboards. The JHU shooting average<br />\nwas about 30 per cent, which is<br />\njust average; but from the charity<br />\nstripe the Jays could only make<br />\nSO per cent of their shots.

But the Jays were able<br />\nto crack the stall and tie up the<br />\ngame 77-77.
