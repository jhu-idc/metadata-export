In<br />\nthe water polo game following the<br />\nmeet the Tigers were again victorious, scoring six goals to none<br />\nfor the Black and Blue. Princeton<br />\nhas held the intercollegiate championship in this branch of sport for<br />\nthe last five years, so it may be seen<br />\nthat Hopkins did well to hold their<br />\nopponents to only six goals.<br />\nAlthough Hopkins failed to score<br />\na first place, competition was keen<br />\nin all the events, the Orange and<br />\nBlack tankmen having to work especially hard in the fancy diving<br />\nand 50-yards dash. In the former<br />\nevent, -Hoffman, diving for the<br />\nBlack and Blue, showed wonderful<br />\nform and was only beaten out for<br />\nfirst place by a fraction of point.<br />\nFrizzell, Princeton's captain, who<br />\nwon this event, placed second in<br />\nlast year's intercollegiates, and Berereton, who placed third, finished<br />\nin the same position in the championships. In the 50-yards dash,<br />\nWoodward and Rowland pushed<br />\nthe Princeton men hard from start<br />\nto finish. In this event the judges<br />\ndiffered as to second place, as<br />\nWoodward and Madden finished in<br />\nalmost a dead heat. The latter was<br />\nfinally awarded second, with Woodward third. The other events in<br />\nwhich Hopkins showed to advantage were the plunge for distance<br />\nand 50-yard back stroke. In both<br />\nof these races the Black and Blue<br />\nplaced second and third, Eiseman<br />\nand Getz scoring in the plunge,<br />\nwhile Woodward and Fulton placed<br />\nin the back stroke.<br />\nPrinceton uncovered a varied and<br />\nwonderfully strong attack in the<br />\nwater polo game. Five goals were.<br />\nscored in the first half before Hopkins became accustomed to the play<br />\nof their more experienced opponents. The second period, however,<br />\nshowed a much stronger defense<br />\nfor the Black and Blue, the Tiger<br />\nstars being held to one tally. Primrose, H. Woodward and Hoffman<br />\nstarred for the locals, while Nourse<br />\nplayed althost the entire game for<br />\nthe Tigers.<br />\nSaturday's meet will be the last<br />\nfor the swimmers, three victories<br />\nhaying been scored out of five<br />\nstarts. Swarthmore, City College<br />\nand Marston's have been defeated,<br />\nwhile meets have been lost to Navy<br />\nand Princeton. Considering the<br />\nfact that this is the first year for<br />\nthe sport at Hopkins, the Black and<br />\n<br />\nDr. John Calvin Ferguson, who<br />\nhas for many years devoted his<br />\ntime to the study of art in China,<br />\nwill give an illustrated lecture on<br />\n\"Chinese Art,\" Monday, March 22,<br />\nat 5 P. M., in McCoy Hall. Dr.<br />\nFerguson was president of Nanking<br />\nUniversity from 1888 to 1897, and<br />\nwas president of Nanyang College,<br />\nShanghai, from 1897 to 1902. He<br />\nhas held many offices of importance<br />\nin China, and is a member of a<br />\nlarge number of honorary orders<br />\nand learned societies. His work in<br />\nChina has been extended over many<br />\nyears, during which time he has<br />\nplayed an important part in the development of many lines of governmental work. He has translated<br />\nseveral important works into the<br />\nChinese tongue.<br />\nBy virtue of his long and close<br />\nacquaintanceship with his subject,<br />\nas well as his powers as a lecturer,<br />\nhis lecture next week promises to<br />\nbe of an unusually interesting character, and should be especially well<br />\nattended.<br />\nBeginning with this evening at<br />\n8 P. M., Mr. Harrington Emerson,<br />\npresident of the Emerson Company<br />\nof New York, will give a series of<br />\nlectures on \"Personal and Industrial Efficiency,\" under the auspices<br />\nof the Department of Engineering.<br />\nThe lectures, which are to be of a<br />\nnon-technical character, will be open<br />\nto all members of the University,<br />\nand to the public. The topics are<br />\nas follows.<br />\nMarch t5\u2014\"The Great Stupidities.\"<br />\nMarch 22 \u2014 \"Fundamentals of<br />\nOrganization.\"<br />\nApril I2\u2014\"Principles of Efficiency.\"<br />\nApril 19\u2014Modern Industry and<br />\nEfficiency.\"<br />\nMr. Emerson, who is an efficiency<br />\nengineer of note, gained wide recognition on account of the results<br />\nhe obtained in his investigation of<br />\nthe Santa Fe Railroad system.<br />\nSince then he has held a position<br />\nof high rank among efficiency engineers and has done much to further<br />\nthe application of the principles of<br />\nthis rapidly developing science. His<br />\nsubject is one which should appeal<br />\nto everyone, and in view of his<br />\nrecognized greatness it, is centainly<br />\na privilege of no mean worth to be<br />\nable to hear him.<br />\n<br />\n(('ontinued on Page 8, col. 3)<br />\n<br />\nOne of the most interesting, original and thoroughly enjoyable banquets ever given by a Hopkins<br />\nundergraduate class took place last<br />\nThursday night, when the Class of<br />\n1017 gathered about the jovial<br />\nboard for an evening of feasting<br />\nand revelry.<br />\nThe banquet was held at the<br />\nHotel Rennert, and a large number<br />\nof hungry second-year men were on<br />\nhand when, at 7.30 o'clock hostilities were formally opened in a<br />\nprivate dining-room. Hopkins precedent was altered in the selection<br />\nof toast-master, in that Mr. Joseph<br />\nChesley filled the position which is<br />\ncustomarily reserved for the class<br />\npresident. Mr. Chesley acquitted<br />\nhimself very creditably in the performance of his duties, and fully<br />\njustified the action of the committee<br />\nwho requested him to do the honors of the evening.<br />\nAs is by no means universally the<br />\ncase, the speeches that followed the<br />\nbanquet proper proved even more<br />\nattractive than had the delights of<br />\nFrench cooking, even though the<br />\nlatter was disguised on the menu<br />\ncards arranged for the occasion<br />\nunder highly suggestive and reminiscent titles. Eddie Stuart sounded<br />\nthe - dominantly serious and contemplative note of the evening with<br />\nan instructive discourse whose object was to settle for all time the<br />\ncontroverted question as to which<br />\nactually is the butt-end of a billygoat. T-Iugh Dryden spoke on the<br />\nHopkins of the future. \"Eggie\"<br />\nGorman discussed several matters<br />\nconnected with \"Sporting Life,\"<br />\nHarry Strauss dealt with his perilous progress from \"common-sense<br />\nto Physics 2,\" ex-President Thompson spoke of his lamentable 'fall to<br />\nthe position of sergeant-at-arms,<br />\nwhile Eugene Canton look for his<br />\ntopic \"The Woman and the Fat<br />\nMan.\"<br />\nThen came the time honored allusions to the immortal Geoffrey.<br />\nwho dominated the remainder of<br />\nthe evening in his accustomed glory.<br />\nThe manner of introducing the subject of the famous pilgrimage was<br />\nhandled with more than the usual<br />\ndegree of originality and effectiveness. \"Fred\" Hall dealt with the<br />\ndusty road that wound its way to<br />\nthe cathedral city; Manuel Gichner,<br />\nof freshman fame, gave an impassioned address on the subject of<br />\nNew Gnu News.<br />\nthe Canterbury Guide; Thompson<br />\nThere was once a lively young gnu,<br />\nspoke in accents of unaffected remWho was captured and placed in a zoo.<br />\nAn old gnu who was there<br />\niniscent delight of the Pilgrims;<br />\nCame forth from his lair,<br />\nL.

He consented,<br />\nhowever, with the understanding<br />\nthat in the event of an unexpected<br />\nturn of foreign affairs which would<br />\ndemand his presence in Washington at the time of the inauguration,<br />\nhe would be obliged to decline.<br />\nIt is sincerely hoped that nothing<br />\nwill happen to prevent the President from being present on this important occasion, and his coming is<br />\nbeing looked forward to with much<br />\npleasure by all Hopkins men.<br />\nThe occasion will have a double<br />\nsignificance, in that it is not only<br />\nto be the inauguration of Dr. Goodnow, but also the formal dedication<br />\nof the Homewood Estate. A large<br />\nnumber of invitations will be sent<br />\nout, and it is expected that the day<br />\nwill mark the gathering of some<br />\nof the most prominent educators in<br />\nAmerica.

It is certainly with<br />\nno mean degree of anticipatory<br />\npleasure that we note the fact that<br />\nHopkins' most illustrious son is to<br />\nbe present at this occasion, which<br />\nmay be said to mark the beginning<br />\nof a new era in the history of Johns<br />\nHopkins.<br />\nPresident Wilson has accepted<br />\nthe invitation to attend with the<br />\ncondition that he may be forced to<br />\ndecline if matters of state demand<br />\nhis attention at the time of the ceremonies in May. It is certainly to<br />\nbe hoped that we may not be so<br />\nunfortpnate as to have to forego the<br />\npleasure of having him with us on<br />\nthis occasion. Johns Hopkins has<br />\nalways taken great pride in President Wilson, and feels distinctly<br />\nhonored, as well as greatly pleased,<br />\nthat he is still interested in the<br />\nprogress of the University to the<br />\nextent that he is willing to come<br />\nhere, and to make an address at<br />\nthe inauguration of our third president.<br />\nThis occasion, which, besides being the official beginning of Dr.<br />\nGoodnow's term as president of the<br />\nUniversity, will mark the formal<br />\ndedication of Homewood to the use<br />\nof Johns Hopkins, is being looked<br />\nforward to with much interest, and<br />\nthe promised presence of President<br />\nWilson serves to make the anticipaPresident Wilson Accepts<br />\n<br />\ntion the more keen and impatient.<br />\nLet us rejoice in the beginning of<br />\nth:s new era at Johns Hopkins, and<br />\nin the fact that the exercises marking its actual inception promise to<br />\ntake on such an added dignity as<br />\nthat afforded by the presence of<br />\nthe President of the United States.<br />\nThe Sophomore Banquet.<br />\n<br />\nThe fact that a sophomore banquet<br />\nwas actually held, and pronounced<br />\nby all who attended \"a great<br />\nsuccess,\" without a single freshman<br />\n\"guest,\" brings to our attention how<br />\nwell the new ideas as to the \"education\" of a freshman, which have<br />\nbeen adopted this year, are being<br />\nsupported by the students as a<br />\nwhole. For many years banquet<br />\ntime has been the one certain occasion when trouble was sure to<br />\noccur between the two lower classes,<br />\nand a sophomore banquet without<br />\nat least a few freshmen to provide<br />\nsport would have been considered<br />\na dismal failure. But last Thursday night found a sophomore class<br />\nactually congratulating itself that<br />\nnot a single member had attempted<br />\nto follow the old tradition. This<br />\nunanimous stand the sophomores<br />\nhave taken to firmly establish the<br />\nnew traditions they are forming<br />\nunder the new sentiment in regard<br />\nto hazing and class fights, is deserving of the heartiest congratulations.<br />\n\u2022 The, new system was much discussed at the banquet, and while it<br />\nmay be said to be still in the experimental stage, some facts about<br />\nit were very clear to everyone.<br />\nFirst, that it has come to stay, and,<br />\nsecondly, that the freshman rules.<br />\nno longer depending upon brute<br />\nforce to enforce them, can be just<br />\nas effectively carried out by the<br />\nforce of united effort on the part<br />\nof the three upper classes. Whereas, it was formerly the part of the<br />\njuniors and seniors to urge on the<br />\nfreshmen against the sophomores,<br />\nthe three upper classes must now<br />\nwork together to make clear to the<br />\nfreshman his proper attitude of respect and consideration to uPperclass men, and the meaning of<br />\n\"Hopkins spirit.\" The sophomores<br />\nare resolved to continue putting<br />\ntheir theories into practice so that<br />\nJohns Hopkins may become a<br />\nworthy example to institutions still<br />\nstruggling under the old method.<br />\nlong believed to be the only practical one.<br />\nDr. Remsen Receives Honorary Degree.<br />\n<br />\nDr. Ira Remsen attended the dedicatory exercises of the Mellon Research Laboratory of the University of Pittsburgh, February 26,<br />\nand the honorary degree of Doctor<br />\nof Laws was conferred upon him<br />\nby the University.<br />\nRevival of pan-American business, with increasing opportunity<br />\nfor young men able to speak Spanish, is resulting in a growing interest in that language, says Professor Caroline Ober, of the University of Washington.<br />\n<br />\n1<br />\n<br />\n1<br />\n<br />\nUNIVERSITY CALENDAR<br />\n<br />\n11<br />\n<br />\nMonday, March 15<br />\n4 P.

In<br />\nthe water polo game following the<br />\nmeet the Tigers were again victorious, scoring six goals to none<br />\nfor the Black and Blue. Princeton<br />\nhas held the intercollegiate championship in this branch of sport for<br />\nthe last five years, so it may be seen<br />\nthat Hopkins did well to hold their<br />\nopponents to only six goals.<br />\nAlthough Hopkins failed to score<br />\na first place, competition was keen<br />\nin all the events, the Orange and<br />\nBlack tankmen having to work especially hard in the fancy diving<br />\nand 50-yards dash. In the former<br />\nevent, -Hoffman, diving for the<br />\nBlack and Blue, showed wonderful<br />\nform and was only beaten out for<br />\nfirst place by a fraction of point.<br />\nFrizzell, Princeton's captain, who<br />\nwon this event, placed second in<br />\nlast year's intercollegiates, and Berereton, who placed third, finished<br />\nin the same position in the championships. In the 50-yards dash,<br />\nWoodward and Rowland pushed<br />\nthe Princeton men hard from start<br />\nto finish. In this event the judges<br />\ndiffered as to second place, as<br />\nWoodward and Madden finished in<br />\nalmost a dead heat. The latter was<br />\nfinally awarded second, with Woodward third. The other events in<br />\nwhich Hopkins showed to advantage were the plunge for distance<br />\nand 50-yard back stroke. In both<br />\nof these races the Black and Blue<br />\nplaced second and third, Eiseman<br />\nand Getz scoring in the plunge,<br />\nwhile Woodward and Fulton placed<br />\nin the back stroke.<br />\nPrinceton uncovered a varied and<br />\nwonderfully strong attack in the<br />\nwater polo game. Five goals were.<br />\nscored in the first half before Hopkins became accustomed to the play<br />\nof their more experienced opponents. The second period, however,<br />\nshowed a much stronger defense<br />\nfor the Black and Blue, the Tiger<br />\nstars being held to one tally. Primrose, H. Woodward and Hoffman<br />\nstarred for the locals, while Nourse<br />\nplayed althost the entire game for<br />\nthe Tigers.<br />\nSaturday's meet will be the last<br />\nfor the swimmers, three victories<br />\nhaying been scored out of five<br />\nstarts. Swarthmore, City College<br />\nand Marston's have been defeated,<br />\nwhile meets have been lost to Navy<br />\nand Princeton. Considering the<br />\nfact that this is the first year for<br />\nthe sport at Hopkins, the Black and<br /><br />\nDr. John Calvin Ferguson, who<br />\nhas for many years devoted his<br />\ntime to the study of art in China,<br />\nwill give an illustrated lecture on<br />\n\"Chinese Art,\" Monday, March 22,<br />\nat 5 P. M., in McCoy Hall. Dr.<br />\nFerguson was president of Nanking<br />\nUniversity from 1888 to 1897, and<br />\nwas president of Nanyang College,<br />\nShanghai, from 1897 to 1902. He<br />\nhas held many offices of importance<br />\nin China, and is a member of a<br />\nlarge number of honorary orders<br />\nand learned societies. His work in<br />\nChina has been extended over many<br />\nyears, during which time he has<br />\nplayed an important part in the development of many lines of governmental work. He has translated<br />\nseveral important works into the<br />\nChinese tongue.<br />\nBy virtue of his long and close<br />\nacquaintanceship with his subject,<br />\nas well as his powers as a lecturer,<br />\nhis lecture next week promises to<br />\nbe of an unusually interesting character, and should be especially well<br />\nattended.<br />\nBeginning with this evening at<br />\n8 P. M., Mr. Harrington Emerson,<br />\npresident of the Emerson Company<br />\nof New York, will give a series of<br />\nlectures on \"Personal and Industrial Efficiency,\" under the auspices<br />\nof the Department of Engineering.<br />\nThe lectures, which are to be of a<br />\nnon-technical character, will be open<br />\nto all members of the University,<br />\nand to the public. The topics are<br />\nas follows.<br />\nMarch t5\u2014\"The Great Stupidities.\"<br />\nMarch 22 \u2014 \"Fundamentals of<br />\nOrganization.\"<br />\nApril I2\u2014\"Principles of Efficiency.\"<br />\nApril 19\u2014Modern Industry and<br />\nEfficiency.\"<br />\nMr. Emerson, who is an efficiency<br />\nengineer of note, gained wide recognition on account of the results<br />\nhe obtained in his investigation of<br />\nthe Santa Fe Railroad system.<br />\nSince then he has held a position<br />\nof high rank among efficiency engineers and has done much to further<br />\nthe application of the principles of<br />\nthis rapidly developing science. His<br />\nsubject is one which should appeal<br />\nto everyone, and in view of his<br />\nrecognized greatness it, is centainly<br />\na privilege of no mean worth to be<br />\nable to hear him.<br /><br />\n(('ontinued on Page 8, col. 3)<br /><br />\nOne of the most interesting, original and thoroughly enjoyable banquets ever given by a Hopkins<br />\nundergraduate class took place last<br />\nThursday night, when the Class of<br />\n1017 gathered about the jovial<br />\nboard for an evening of feasting<br />\nand revelry.<br />\nThe banquet was held at the<br />\nHotel Rennert, and a large number<br />\nof hungry second-year men were on<br />\nhand when, at 7.30 o'clock hostilities were formally opened in a<br />\nprivate dining-room. Hopkins precedent was altered in the selection<br />\nof toast-master, in that Mr. Joseph<br />\nChesley filled the position which is<br />\ncustomarily reserved for the class<br />\npresident. Mr. Chesley acquitted<br />\nhimself very creditably in the performance of his duties, and fully<br />\njustified the action of the committee<br />\nwho requested him to do the honors of the evening.<br />\nAs is by no means universally the<br />\ncase, the speeches that followed the<br />\nbanquet proper proved even more<br />\nattractive than had the delights of<br />\nFrench cooking, even though the<br />\nlatter was disguised on the menu<br />\ncards arranged for the occasion<br />\nunder highly suggestive and reminiscent titles. Eddie Stuart sounded<br />\nthe - dominantly serious and contemplative note of the evening with<br />\nan instructive discourse whose object was to settle for all time the<br />\ncontroverted question as to which<br />\nactually is the butt-end of a billygoat. T-Iugh Dryden spoke on the<br />\nHopkins of the future. \"Eggie\"<br />\nGorman discussed several matters<br />\nconnected with \"Sporting Life,\"<br />\nHarry Strauss dealt with his perilous progress from \"common-sense<br />\nto Physics 2,\" ex-President Thompson spoke of his lamentable 'fall to<br />\nthe position of sergeant-at-arms,<br />\nwhile Eugene Canton look for his<br />\ntopic \"The Woman and the Fat<br />\nMan.\"<br />\nThen came the time honored allusions to the immortal Geoffrey.<br />\nwho dominated the remainder of<br />\nthe evening in his accustomed glory.<br />\nThe manner of introducing the subject of the famous pilgrimage was<br />\nhandled with more than the usual<br />\ndegree of originality and effectiveness. \"Fred\" Hall dealt with the<br />\ndusty road that wound its way to<br />\nthe cathedral city; Manuel Gichner,<br />\nof freshman fame, gave an impassioned address on the subject of<br />\nNew Gnu News.<br />\nthe Canterbury Guide; Thompson<br />\nThere was once a lively young gnu,<br />\nspoke in accents of unaffected remWho was captured and placed in a zoo.<br />\nAn old gnu who was there<br />\niniscent delight of the Pilgrims;<br />\nCame forth from his lair,<br />\nL.

A delegation,<br />\ncomposed of Mr. R.

He consented,<br />\nhowever, with the understanding<br />\nthat in the event of an unexpected<br />\nturn of foreign affairs which would<br />\ndemand his presence in Washington at the time of the inauguration,<br />\nhe would be obliged to decline.<br />\nIt is sincerely hoped that nothing<br />\nwill happen to prevent the President from being present on this important occasion, and his coming is<br />\nbeing looked forward to with much<br />\npleasure by all Hopkins men.<br />\nThe occasion will have a double<br />\nsignificance, in that it is not only<br />\nto be the inauguration of Dr. Goodnow, but also the formal dedication<br />\nof the Homewood Estate. A large<br />\nnumber of invitations will be sent<br />\nout, and it is expected that the day<br />\nwill mark the gathering of some<br />\nof the most prominent educators in<br />\nAmerica.

It is certainly with<br />\nno mean degree of anticipatory<br />\npleasure that we note the fact that<br />\nHopkins' most illustrious son is to<br />\nbe present at this occasion, which<br />\nmay be said to mark the beginning<br />\nof a new era in the history of Johns<br />\nHopkins.<br />\nPresident Wilson has accepted<br />\nthe invitation to attend with the<br />\ncondition that he may be forced to<br />\ndecline if matters of state demand<br />\nhis attention at the time of the ceremonies in May. It is certainly to<br />\nbe hoped that we may not be so<br />\nunfortpnate as to have to forego the<br />\npleasure of having him with us on<br />\nthis occasion. Johns Hopkins has<br />\nalways taken great pride in President Wilson, and feels distinctly<br />\nhonored, as well as greatly pleased,<br />\nthat he is still interested in the<br />\nprogress of the University to the<br />\nextent that he is willing to come<br />\nhere, and to make an address at<br />\nthe inauguration of our third president.<br />\nThis occasion, which, besides being the official beginning of Dr.<br />\nGoodnow's term as president of the<br />\nUniversity, will mark the formal<br />\ndedication of Homewood to the use<br />\nof Johns Hopkins, is being looked<br />\nforward to with much interest, and<br />\nthe promised presence of President<br />\nWilson serves to make the anticipaPresident Wilson Accepts<br /><br />\ntion the more keen and impatient.<br />\nLet us rejoice in the beginning of<br />\nth:s new era at Johns Hopkins, and<br />\nin the fact that the exercises marking its actual inception promise to<br />\ntake on such an added dignity as<br />\nthat afforded by the presence of<br />\nthe President of the United States.<br />\nThe Sophomore Banquet.<br /><br />\nThe fact that a sophomore banquet<br />\nwas actually held, and pronounced<br />\nby all who attended \"a great<br />\nsuccess,\" without a single freshman<br />\n\"guest,\" brings to our attention how<br />\nwell the new ideas as to the \"education\" of a freshman, which have<br />\nbeen adopted this year, are being<br />\nsupported by the students as a<br />\nwhole. For many years banquet<br />\ntime has been the one certain occasion when trouble was sure to<br />\noccur between the two lower classes,<br />\nand a sophomore banquet without<br />\nat least a few freshmen to provide<br />\nsport would have been considered<br />\na dismal failure. But last Thursday night found a sophomore class<br />\nactually congratulating itself that<br />\nnot a single member had attempted<br />\nto follow the old tradition. This<br />\nunanimous stand the sophomores<br />\nhave taken to firmly establish the<br />\nnew traditions they are forming<br />\nunder the new sentiment in regard<br />\nto hazing and class fights, is deserving of the heartiest congratulations.<br />\n\u2022 The, new system was much discussed at the banquet, and while it<br />\nmay be said to be still in the experimental stage, some facts about<br />\nit were very clear to everyone.<br />\nFirst, that it has come to stay, and,<br />\nsecondly, that the freshman rules.<br />\nno longer depending upon brute<br />\nforce to enforce them, can be just<br />\nas effectively carried out by the<br />\nforce of united effort on the part<br />\nof the three upper classes. Whereas, it was formerly the part of the<br />\njuniors and seniors to urge on the<br />\nfreshmen against the sophomores,<br />\nthe three upper classes must now<br />\nwork together to make clear to the<br />\nfreshman his proper attitude of respect and consideration to uPperclass men, and the meaning of<br />\n\"Hopkins spirit.\" The sophomores<br />\nare resolved to continue putting<br />\ntheir theories into practice so that<br />\nJohns Hopkins may become a<br />\nworthy example to institutions still<br />\nstruggling under the old method.<br />\nlong believed to be the only practical one.<br />\nDr. Remsen Receives Honorary Degree.<br /><br />\nDr. Ira Remsen attended the dedicatory exercises of the Mellon Research Laboratory of the University of Pittsburgh, February 26,<br />\nand the honorary degree of Doctor<br />\nof Laws was conferred upon him<br />\nby the University.<br />\nRevival of pan-American business, with increasing opportunity<br />\nfor young men able to speak Spanish, is resulting in a growing interest in that language, says Professor Caroline Ober, of the University of Washington.<br /><br />\n1<br /><br />\n1<br /><br />\nUNIVERSITY CALENDAR<br /><br />\n11<br /><br />\nMonday, March 15<br />\n4 P.

This<br />\nnumber is larger than the total enrollment of either Yale, Princeton,<br />\nMinnesota, or Northwestern. One<br />\nthousand seven hundred of these<br />\nstudents were listed in undergraduate and graduate courses in arts<br />\nand sciences.

Mr. H. A. Roberts,<br />\nsecretary of the Board, made a recent report in which he said that in<br />\nthe period before 1870, only three<br />\nper cent, of university men went<br />\ninto business. By 1900 the percentage had risen to twenty, and<br />\nat the present time Trinity reports<br />\nforty-three per cent, of its men going into business.<br />\n* * *<br />\n\"Lost and Found\" at Yale.<br /><br />\nThe Police Department at Yale<br />\nUniversity has recently established<br />\na lost-and-found bureau.
