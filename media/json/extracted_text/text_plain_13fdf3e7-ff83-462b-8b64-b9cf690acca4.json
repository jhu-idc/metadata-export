Petran presented a recital in Levering Hall<br />\nlast Tuesday, which consisted of a<br />\ngroup of light numbers, all of them<br />\nplayed in a very charming and delightful manner. The compositions<br />\nwere chosen from the period in music known as the \"late .romantic<br />\nperiod.\" The earmark of such compositions is \"dressed up sentimentalism.\" This consists of compositions written in a very sugary<br />\nstyle with runs and frills which are<br />\nabsolutely unnecessary in the composition. There has been a violent<br />\nreaction to such music and that period is hardly ever heard on the<br />\nconcert platform except in the composition of Chopin and Liszt.<br />\n<br />\nThe complete program was as<br />\nfollows<br />\n:<br />\nAfter both teams had spent about<br />\nThese Hotels offer superior<br />\naccommodations for your<br />\nthree minutes in passing and shoot- Liadow<br />\nBacarolle<br />\nnext visit to<br />\ning to no avail, Dillon, Hoya cen- Glazounow<br />\nLa Nuit<br />\nWashington, D.

Then, too, although it is required for graduation in some<br />\nform or another, this requirement is not rigidly enforced and the<br />\nauthorities will not recognize it as vitally important enough to be<br />\nworthy of graduation points.
