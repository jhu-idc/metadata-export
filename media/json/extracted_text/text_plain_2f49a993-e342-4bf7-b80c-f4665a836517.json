At that time talking and smoking<br />\npainters added to the general commotion that usually<br />\noccurs around Miss Hubbard's desk and telephone which<br />\nresulted in a central room that was literally a zoo on<br />\ndisplay to any students who wanted to take time from<br />\nstudying. In fact students really had no choice about<br />\nghouling there.<br />\nAn ironic overtone to the cleanup was the stunningly incomplete job that was done to the crystal<br />\nchandeliers which hang in the Gilman Memorial Room.<br />\nThe tear drop cut glass which dangle from the chandeliers were removed and polished while painters did a<br />\nfast refinishing of the ceiling and walls in the lobby of<br />\nthe main reading room. When the painting was finished<br />\nthe polished tear drops were replaced on the chandeliers<br />\nwhich still hold the dust which has fallen on them since<br />\nlast year's Commemoration Day. Hopefully the bulk of<br />\nthe chandeliers will remain dust laden until after Commemoration Day as a fit token of the attitude the<br />\nUniversity takes to its facilities and their local users.<br />\nTwo suggestions immediately present themselves<br />\nfor the administrative overseers of the pre-Commemoration Day get-neat campaign. They should either leave<br />\nthe reception rooms as they are during the remainder<br />\nof the year or give the cleaning crew a pep talk about<br />\norganization pride so that they keep things presentable<br />\nall year long. After all, it would be nice if the regular<br />\nusers of the library were also privileged by a clean<br />\nenvironment too.<br />\nOne more comment is provoked by the attitude<br />\ntaken by the University toward Commemoration Day and<br />\nthe Gilman facilities. Each year the six bulletin boards<br />\nin the hallway in front of the reading room are gifted<br />\nwith new displays, again just prior to Commemoration<br />\nDay. During the remainder of the year they are neglected, left open to occasional bulletin-board lifters and<br />\noutdated. Last year's display had a check-list of University projects neatly decorated with red check marks<br />\nwhich indicated those projects already completed. This<br />\ndisplay is precisely twelve months behind. But it is<br />\ncolorful and gay. Maybe it can be salvaged along with<br />\nthe dusty chandeliers so that the visiting group on<br />\nFebruary 22 can gain a true insight into the way the<br />\nHop ticks.<br />\n<br />\nHistory Repeats<br />\nJoe Perrotto seems to have found the answer at<br />\nlast. The way to make Hopkins bearable is to get out<br />\nof it. Joe, apparently elated with this hold and original<br />\nsolution to the problem of survival in our mudhole,<br />\nhas accepted a full-time job teaching in the Baltimore<br />\nschool system. In spite of our best intentions, we must<br />\nquestion the good faith of such an action on the part<br />\nof the most important undergraduate on campus. We<br />\ncannot see why anyone as sincere, as uncalculating, as<br />\ngenuinely well meaning as Perrotto should leave a<br />\ncampus where he holds so much responsibility for undergraduate affairs. Nor can we see Perrotto's well known<br />\nego allowing him to relinquish any of his hard earned<br />\npower.<br />\nSo it looks as if there is now a part time leader,<br />\nif any, at all of the undergraduate body. Perhaps some<br />\nambitious class president will form a committee to \"get<br />\nthings done around here\" while Joe is busy elsewhere.<br />\nTo keep things going in the style to which we have<br />\nbecome accustomed he might as well call it H4U.<br />\n<br />\nKudos<br />\nFrom all reports the Debate Council's annual invitation tournament was an unqualified success. The event<br />\nattracted thirty competing teams representing some of<br />\nthe major colleges and universities in the East and went<br />\noff without a hitch. On a campus where most organizations seem bogged hopelessly in self congratulation and<br />\nprocedural niggles, such positive and effective activity<br />\nis refreshingly welcome.<br />\nKudos to the Debate Council; perhaps this will<br />\nInspire the Student Council to form a much needed<br />\nCommittee to Observe Well Run Campus Organizations.<br />\n<br />\nHOMEWOOD, BALTIMORE, FEBRUARY 8,<br />\n<br />\n1963<br />\n<br />\nVeritas Vets Liberabit<br />\n<br />\nI, Academic Oxymoron?<br />\nBy W.

Travel Seminar<br />\nReveals New T. Williams<br />\nBy BOB LANDAU<br />\nTennessee Williams' newest<br />\nplay to open on Broadway, The<br />\nMilk Train Doesn't Stop Here<br />\nAny More, brings out another<br />\nfacet of the new Williams, the<br />\nauthor who expresses his ideas<br />\nin words, rather than in the portrayal of violence and perversion.<br />\nThe plot concerns Mrs. Flora<br />\nGoforth, a fantastically wealthy<br />\nlady in her early sixties, who is<br />\nin the process of writing her<br />\nmemoirs, for, she says, an early<br />\ndeadline. Actually, she is dying<br />\nof cancer, and desperatley fears<br />\nwhat is to come. As she wanders about her three luxurious<br />\nvillas on the coast of Italy, dictating her memoirs, we learn<br />\nthat she attained her wealth by<br />\nsurviving six husbands. Of the<br />\nfirst five, each one was wealthier<br />\nand uglier than the next (one<br />\nshe constantly refers to as \"the<br />\nBig Ape\"). But this did not deter<br />\nher: money and material wealth<br />\nwere what she desired, and so<br />\nshe willingly gave of her beautiful body in return for these<br />\nsources of luxury.<br />\n<br />\nIi<br />\n<br />\nGoforth's sensual appetite is aroused again, at the<br />\narrival of another young penniless, but handsome poet named<br />\nChris Flanders. Enticed by the<br />\npoet's good looks, she decides on<br />\none last fling. But before she<br />\ntalks with him, Flora learns<br />\nfrom a friend that Chris is nicknamed the \"Angel of Death,\" by<br />\nvirtue of his previously having<br />\nstayed with seven elderly women, each of whom died while he<br />\nwas there. Another thing that<br />\namazes Flora is how this man,<br />\nwith no means of transportation<br />\ncould obtain entrance to her<br />\nvilla, since the only route is by<br />\n<br />\nthe sea, or through a rugged<br />\npath through the mountains by<br />\nland. But Chris is here, and the<br />\nnext morning Flora offers him<br />\nthe luxury and monetary security of her care, in return for his<br />\nservices as her lover. Most Williams heroes, like Chance Wayne<br />\nthe gigolo in Sweet Bird of<br />\nYouth would have accepted this<br />\noffer gladly, and moralized over<br />\nit later, but Chris turns it down.<br />\nRather he prefers to stay on and<br />\ngive the dying women 'sympathy<br />\nand companionship,\" and \"touch<br />\nthe heart.\" The angered and rejected Flora tells him to see<br />\nthings her way, or get out. And<br />\nwhen Chris chooses the latter,<br />\nin telling her he will visit another lady dying in Sicily, Mrs.<br />\nGoforth, knowing he is penniless, asks him sardonically,<br />\n\"How do you expect to get<br />\nthere? Can you walk on water?\"<br />\nThe allusion to Christ is<br />\nobvious, and therein, I feel, lies<br />\nthe meaning of the play. What<br />\nWilliams is saying is that only<br />\na God can resist the temptations<br />\nof the flesh. It is part of what<br />\n<br />\ncan be called Williams' realistic<br />\npoint of view, and describes an<br />\nalmost universal human condition. As we grow up, we are<br />\ntaught to believe in goodness<br />\nand idealistic values, but as we<br />\nbecome part of society, our<br />\nhuman needs and desire undermine these values. In the Williams world, one can moralize<br />\nforever, but very few can strictly<br />\navoid natural temptations which<br />\nare branded immoral. Through<br />\nFlora's body, Chris may attain<br />\nall the material wealth that most<br />\npeople in the world desire. Only<br />\nbecause he symbolizes a God is<br />\nhe impervious to her sumptuous<br />\nofferings, thus enabling him to<br />\navoid the fall into immorality<br />\nWilliams' more<br />\nsuffered by<br />\nearthbound heroes.<br />\n<br />\nWHAT'S<br />\nNEW<br />\nIN THE FEBRUARY<br />\n<br />\nATLANTIC?<br />\n\"How Not to Teach Teachers\": The<br />\n<br />\nJOBS IN EUROPE<br />\n(Advertisement)<br />\n<br />\ntraining of American teachers is \"unwieldy, slow-witted, bureaucratic .. .<br />\na failure,\" says James D.

Wilson Shaffer<br /><br />\nWhat Me Worry?<br />\nThe hypocrisy of the administration and the inconsiderate planning of someone in the plant manager's<br />\noffice were remarkably visible during the facelifting of<br />\nthe Gilman main reading room during final exam week.<br />\nEvery year, it seems, the administration decides to<br />\nclean up the dirt in and around the main reading room.<br />\nAnd, ironically, this always occurs just prior to Commemoration Day when that area of Gilman Hall is on<br />\ndisplay to the Baltimore community and to guests of<br />\nthe University at its anniversary celebration.<br />\nThis year, however, the facelifting was more complete than it had been in several years. Painters did<br />\npatchwork in the main reading room during the very<br />\nweek when silence was most needed in the central study<br />\narea on campus. At that time talking and smoking<br />\npainters added to the general commotion that usually<br />\noccurs around Miss Hubbard's desk and telephone which<br />\nresulted in a central room that was literally a zoo on<br />\ndisplay to any students who wanted to take time from<br />\nstudying. In fact students really had no choice about<br />\nghouling there.<br />\nAn ironic overtone to the cleanup was the stunningly incomplete job that was done to the crystal<br />\nchandeliers which hang in the Gilman Memorial Room.<br />\nThe tear drop cut glass which dangle from the chandeliers were removed and polished while painters did a<br />\nfast refinishing of the ceiling and walls in the lobby of<br />\nthe main reading room. When the painting was finished<br />\nthe polished tear drops were replaced on the chandeliers<br />\nwhich still hold the dust which has fallen on them since<br />\nlast year's Commemoration Day. Hopefully the bulk of<br />\nthe chandeliers will remain dust laden until after Commemoration Day as a fit token of the attitude the<br />\nUniversity takes to its facilities and their local users.<br />\nTwo suggestions immediately present themselves<br />\nfor the administrative overseers of the pre-Commemoration Day get-neat campaign. They should either leave<br />\nthe reception rooms as they are during the remainder<br />\nof the year or give the cleaning crew a pep talk about<br />\norganization pride so that they keep things presentable<br />\nall year long. After all, it would be nice if the regular<br />\nusers of the library were also privileged by a clean<br />\nenvironment too.<br />\nOne more comment is provoked by the attitude<br />\ntaken by the University toward Commemoration Day and<br />\nthe Gilman facilities. Each year the six bulletin boards<br />\nin the hallway in front of the reading room are gifted<br />\nwith new displays, again just prior to Commemoration<br />\nDay. During the remainder of the year they are neglected, left open to occasional bulletin-board lifters and<br />\noutdated. Last year's display had a check-list of University projects neatly decorated with red check marks<br />\nwhich indicated those projects already completed. This<br />\ndisplay is precisely twelve months behind. But it is<br />\ncolorful and gay. Maybe it can be salvaged along with<br />\nthe dusty chandeliers so that the visiting group on<br />\nFebruary 22 can gain a true insight into the way the<br />\nHop ticks.<br /><br />\nHistory Repeats<br />\nJoe Perrotto seems to have found the answer at<br />\nlast. The way to make Hopkins bearable is to get out<br />\nof it. Joe, apparently elated with this hold and original<br />\nsolution to the problem of survival in our mudhole,<br />\nhas accepted a full-time job teaching in the Baltimore<br />\nschool system. In spite of our best intentions, we must<br />\nquestion the good faith of such an action on the part<br />\nof the most important undergraduate on campus. We<br />\ncannot see why anyone as sincere, as uncalculating, as<br />\ngenuinely well meaning as Perrotto should leave a<br />\ncampus where he holds so much responsibility for undergraduate affairs. Nor can we see Perrotto's well known<br />\nego allowing him to relinquish any of his hard earned<br />\npower.<br />\nSo it looks as if there is now a part time leader,<br />\nif any, at all of the undergraduate body. Perhaps some<br />\nambitious class president will form a committee to \"get<br />\nthings done around here\" while Joe is busy elsewhere.<br />\nTo keep things going in the style to which we have<br />\nbecome accustomed he might as well call it H4U.<br /><br />\nKudos<br />\nFrom all reports the Debate Council's annual invitation tournament was an unqualified success. The event<br />\nattracted thirty competing teams representing some of<br />\nthe major colleges and universities in the East and went<br />\noff without a hitch. On a campus where most organizations seem bogged hopelessly in self congratulation and<br />\nprocedural niggles, such positive and effective activity<br />\nis refreshingly welcome.<br />\nKudos to the Debate Council; perhaps this will<br />\nInspire the Student Council to form a much needed<br />\nCommittee to Observe Well Run Campus Organizations.<br /><br />\nHOMEWOOD, BALTIMORE, FEBRUARY 8,<br /><br />\n1963<br /><br />\nVeritas Vets Liberabit<br /><br />\nI, Academic Oxymoron?<br />\nBy W.

Travel Seminar<br />\nReveals New T. Williams<br />\nBy BOB LANDAU<br />\nTennessee Williams' newest<br />\nplay to open on Broadway, The<br />\nMilk Train Doesn't Stop Here<br />\nAny More, brings out another<br />\nfacet of the new Williams, the<br />\nauthor who expresses his ideas<br />\nin words, rather than in the portrayal of violence and perversion.<br />\nThe plot concerns Mrs. Flora<br />\nGoforth, a fantastically wealthy<br />\nlady in her early sixties, who is<br />\nin the process of writing her<br />\nmemoirs, for, she says, an early<br />\ndeadline. Actually, she is dying<br />\nof cancer, and desperatley fears<br />\nwhat is to come. As she wanders about her three luxurious<br />\nvillas on the coast of Italy, dictating her memoirs, we learn<br />\nthat she attained her wealth by<br />\nsurviving six husbands. Of the<br />\nfirst five, each one was wealthier<br />\nand uglier than the next (one<br />\nshe constantly refers to as \"the<br />\nBig Ape\"). But this did not deter<br />\nher: money and material wealth<br />\nwere what she desired, and so<br />\nshe willingly gave of her beautiful body in return for these<br />\nsources of luxury.<br /><br />\nIi<br /><br />\nGoforth's sensual appetite is aroused again, at the<br />\narrival of another young penniless, but handsome poet named<br />\nChris Flanders. Enticed by the<br />\npoet's good looks, she decides on<br />\none last fling. But before she<br />\ntalks with him, Flora learns<br />\nfrom a friend that Chris is nicknamed the \"Angel of Death,\" by<br />\nvirtue of his previously having<br />\nstayed with seven elderly women, each of whom died while he<br />\nwas there. Another thing that<br />\namazes Flora is how this man,<br />\nwith no means of transportation<br />\ncould obtain entrance to her<br />\nvilla, since the only route is by<br /><br />\nthe sea, or through a rugged<br />\npath through the mountains by<br />\nland. But Chris is here, and the<br />\nnext morning Flora offers him<br />\nthe luxury and monetary security of her care, in return for his<br />\nservices as her lover. Most Williams heroes, like Chance Wayne<br />\nthe gigolo in Sweet Bird of<br />\nYouth would have accepted this<br />\noffer gladly, and moralized over<br />\nit later, but Chris turns it down.<br />\nRather he prefers to stay on and<br />\ngive the dying women 'sympathy<br />\nand companionship,\" and \"touch<br />\nthe heart.\" The angered and rejected Flora tells him to see<br />\nthings her way, or get out. And<br />\nwhen Chris chooses the latter,<br />\nin telling her he will visit another lady dying in Sicily, Mrs.<br />\nGoforth, knowing he is penniless, asks him sardonically,<br />\n\"How do you expect to get<br />\nthere? Can you walk on water?\"<br />\nThe allusion to Christ is<br />\nobvious, and therein, I feel, lies<br />\nthe meaning of the play. What<br />\nWilliams is saying is that only<br />\na God can resist the temptations<br />\nof the flesh. It is part of what<br /><br />\ncan be called Williams' realistic<br />\npoint of view, and describes an<br />\nalmost universal human condition. As we grow up, we are<br />\ntaught to believe in goodness<br />\nand idealistic values, but as we<br />\nbecome part of society, our<br />\nhuman needs and desire undermine these values. In the Williams world, one can moralize<br />\nforever, but very few can strictly<br />\navoid natural temptations which<br />\nare branded immoral. Through<br />\nFlora's body, Chris may attain<br />\nall the material wealth that most<br />\npeople in the world desire. Only<br />\nbecause he symbolizes a God is<br />\nhe impervious to her sumptuous<br />\nofferings, thus enabling him to<br />\navoid the fall into immorality<br />\nWilliams' more<br />\nsuffered by<br />\nearthbound heroes.<br /><br />\nWHAT'S<br />\nNEW<br />\nIN THE FEBRUARY<br /><br />\nATLANTIC?<br />\n\"How Not to Teach Teachers\": The<br /><br />\nJOBS IN EUROPE<br />\n(Advertisement)<br /><br />\ntraining of American teachers is \"unwieldy, slow-witted, bureaucratic .. .<br />\na failure,\" says James D.

I was saying you can marry money but, of<br />\ncourse, you will not because you are a high-minded, cleanliving, pure-hearted, freckle-faced American kid. Therefore, to<br />\nkeep from flunking, you must try the second method: you must<br />\nlearn how to take lecture notes.<br />\nAccording to a recent survey, 123.6% of American undergraduates do not know the proper way to take lecture notes. To<br />\nillustrate this shocking statistic, let us suppose you are taking<br />\na course in history. Let us further suppose the lecturer is lecturing on the ruling houses of England. You listen intently. You<br />\nwrite diligently in your notebook, making a topic outline as you<br />\nhave been taught. Like this:<br />\nI. House of Plantagenet.<br />\nII.
