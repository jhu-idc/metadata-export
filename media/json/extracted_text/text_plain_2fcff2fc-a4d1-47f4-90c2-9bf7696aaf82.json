In short<br />\nthey promote \"college spirit.\" We regard these alone as sufficient<br />\nbenefits to the college to warrant their existance. We do not think<br />\nthey should be kept up simply to win games.

The men who have the<br />\nspirit, who have done the work, who carry with them the college support, and who can bring<br />\nit back again in years to come, are sitting on the benches or paying admission, while the game<br />\nis played by a club of unknown men, each from a different college, whose expenses are payed<br />\nby the undergraduates, and yet who do not care enough about Hopkins to learn our Hullabaloo.<br />\nWe understand that the baseball game with Washington and Lee was canceled because it was thought that right here in Baltimore, where we are supposedly back by our own<br />\ncollege, not enough gate money could be taken in to pay expenses.<br />\nIf this is the case, and such is the general attitude of the student body, the team ought<br />\nto be given up. It is not the function of our Athletic Association to support a baseball club,<br />\nand it is asking too much of our undergraduates to expect them to give money, time and effort<br />\nfor a team they do not know, and on which they cannot play.<br />\nNow, since it is the purpose of the Athletic Association to foster and not to kill<br />\nathletics, and especially to promote them in the form which they primarily exist, some such<br />\nruling should be made as shall make the majority, and therefore the character of our teams<br />\nundergraduate amature, not post-graduate and, in a certian sense, professional.<br />\n<br />\n\fTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\n<br />\n3<br />\n<br />\nHEREAS, There has risen with the return of spring a feeling of<br />\nadventure, or rather daredevilishness, among the members of the undergraduate body, and,<br />\nWHEREAS, several of the aforesaid undergraduates have given<br />\nvent to this rash feeling of adventure by tossing sundry coins upon<br />\nthe hallowed byways of our beloved campus, and,<br />\nWHEREAS, a fool and his money is soon parted, be it therefore,<br />\nResolved, That we, the undersigned members of the above mentioned undergraduate body, extend our heartfelt sympathy to those<br />\nwho have been so unfortunate as to retire poorer than they began,<br />\nand be it further,<br />\nResolved, That we show an evidence of our sorrow and sympathy, by inviting the unfortunates to come back into our rnidsts, and be it further,<br />\nResolved, That a copy of these resolutions be published in the NEWS-LETTER in hopes<br />\nof enticing more suckers to join in the game.<br />\nRICH HARD MCA/TERRY,<br />\nJAY MERRYMAN,<br />\nG.

At first sight the subject<br />\nwould seem to be a peculiarly \"spicy\" one,<br />\nand one which would produce quite a good<br />\ndeal of amusement. On the contrary, however, both sides found it rather carnbersome,<br />\nespecially as it is very much involved with<br />\nhazy law problems.<br />\nThe University was well represented by<br />\nMann, Lingewald and Holmes, who had made<br />\ntheir first acquaintance with the subject in the<br />\ninter-class debate. Virginia also had debated<br />\nthe question once before with Washington and<br />\nLee.<br />\nIn oratorical ability our men outclassed the<br />\nvisitors, whose sweet southern voices were<br />\nvery pleasing, but not quite forceful enough<br />\nin driving home upon the audience the realization of the \"outrageous condition of injustice, immorality and fraud existing under<br />\nthe present system of \"legalized polygamy.\"<br />\nThe Virginia men are to be congratulated,<br />\nhowever, on their ability at rebuttal, during<br />\nthe course of which they raised quite a good<br />\ndeal of \"thunder \"\u2014especially over the question of the birthday of the National Divorce<br />\nCongress.<br />\nBoth sides gave the divorce problem a<br />\nsevere overhauling, but neither enlightened us<br />\nmuch on the question of marriage, which<br />\nwould have been much more interesting, and<br />\ncertainly more instructive.<br />\nThere was the usual large and enthusiastic<br />\naudience which has helped to make the debates<br />\nso successful in the past. Dr. Retusen's<br />\naddress, the music contributed by the Glee and<br />\nMandolin clubs, not to mention the noise con-<br />\n<br />\n5<br />\n<br />\ntributed by the student body at large, helped<br />\nto make the debate most successful.<br />\nThe debate was fairly won and no one, I<br />\nthink, would dispute the decision\u2014least of<br />\nall, ourselves. The question, however, was<br />\nnot a good one, for the affirmative, as both the<br />\ninter-class and the University debates show,<br />\nwas laboring under an exceedingly heavy<br />\nburden of proof, which Virginia never succeeded in throwing off, although she announced<br />\nat the beginning that she had kindly pitched<br />\nit over on our shoulders.<br />\n<br />\nHOPKINS NIGHT.<br />\nA most enjoyable evening was spent at the<br />\ntheatre on Hopkins Night. Although we had<br />\nthe usual Hopkins weather\u2014raining or snowing\u2014there was present a large and fashionable<br />\naudience. All of the boxes were taken by<br />\nattractive young ladies from Bryn Mawr<br />\nSchool and the Woman's College. The orchestra chairs were nearly all occupied, and<br />\nthe first balcony was likewise filled. The<br />\nfirst two rows in the dress circle were held<br />\ndown by the Hopkins students who livened<br />\nthings up greatly between the acts and occasionally when the favorites in the cast appeared upon the stage.<br />\nThe actors and actresses certainty entered<br />\ninto the spirit of the occasion and were not<br />\nat all troubled by being interrupted in their<br />\nparts by yells. The Hopkins colors were<br />\nworn by several of the members of the company, and the large Hopkins banner occupied<br />\na prominent place on the merry-go-round.<br />\nThe theater, as usual, was very prettily<br />\ndecorated with the Hopkins flags and class<br />\nbanners. It is a very difficult task to decorate<br />\nthe theatre, and those who did the work<br />\ndeserve a great deal of credit.<br />\nA new feature was instituted at this Hopkins Night by having an alumnus make an<br />\ninformal address between the acts. We enjoyed the speech very much, and are greatly<br />\nindebted to Mr. Stuart Symington. We hope<br />\nthat this custom will be continued at all the<br />\nHopkins Nights next year. Then, too, there<br />\nwere very pretty souvenir programs printed<br />\nfor the occasion.<br />\nAs to the show itself, we must admit that it<br />\nwas no better than the general run of comic<br />\n<br />\n\fTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\n<br />\n6<br />\n<br />\noperas, although the plot was absolutely<br />\noriginal. There were several catchy songs in<br />\nthe show. Mr. Bulger was just as entertaining as ever, and both Miss Snider and Miss<br />\nFisher were very attractive and sang very<br />\nwell. The chorus, however, was still in need<br />\nof more drilling.<br />\nNow, to the business side of the occasion.<br />\nWe understand that although there was a considerable amount of money taken in, the expenses were very heavy, and the Hullaballoo<br />\nBoard and the Athletic Association did not<br />\nmake as much money as they expected. We<br />\nhear that not more than one hundred dollars<br />\nwas cleared altogether. It seems too bad that<br />\nwe can not make more of a success out of<br />\nthese Hopkins Nights. Notwithstanding the<br />\nfact that it was not a success from the financial<br />\nstandpoint, it most assuredly was from the<br />\nsocial side, and for that reason, if nothing<br />\nmore, Hopkins Nights should be given often<br />\nnext year.<br />\n<br />\nCHESS CLUB.<br />\nThe Chess Club has about completed a busy<br />\nand successful season. Much interest has<br />\nbeen displayed in the Royal game in the<br />\nUniversity this year, especially among the<br />\nfreshmen, a number of whom joined the club.<br />\nThere were two tourneys; the Major was won<br />\nby B. A. Bernstein, (grad.), with A. E.<br />\nLandry (grad.), second, and J. E. Hodgson<br />\n(grad.) and Pearce, '09, tied tor third. W. J.<br />\nWhite, '09, won the minor tourney, with<br />\nB. M. Parelhoff, '07, second, and H. L.<br />\nRussell, '09, and D. Ellison, '07, tied for third<br />\nhonor.<br />\nThe first event of importance was the visit<br />\nof Mr. Liebenstein, the champion of Maryland,<br />\nwho gave a short talk on some tricks of chess,<br />\nfollowed by an exhibition of simultaneous<br />\nplay. He played eight games at once against<br />\ntwo opponents at each board, and won them<br />\nall. The same night the handsome chess<br />\ntable, presented to the club by Prof. Isaac L.<br />\nRice of New York, was put into commission.<br />\nIt is of Dutch oak, inlaid with boxwood and<br />\nebony squres, and contains twenty-five silver<br />\nmedals to contain the names of future champions of the club.<br />\nA match was arranged between the first<br />\n<br />\nseven in the minor tourney and the team of<br />\nthe Baltimore Polytechnic Institute.

Moreover their teamThe Hopkins attack did not play as well to- work was much better than expected.

Washington game was a disappointment to rooters and team alike. After the<br />\nteam bad won superbly from Lehigh in the<br />\nsecond half of their game, everybody looked<br />\nfor Hopkins to beat the Mountaineers, and<br />\nthere was plenty of Hopkins money. Everyone knows the story of the game, and it is<br />\nuseless to dwell upon unpleasant details. The<br />\nMt. Washington defense was \" wise,\" and<br />\nmade it their whole business to cover up Knipp<br />\nand Frank. With those two out of the game,<br />\nthe rest of the attack were at sea, and did not<br />\nknow what to do. The clever dodging of<br />\nEstes was responsible for more than one of Mt.<br />\nWashington's goal, and it is up to our defense<br />\nto correct this error.<br />\nThe goal shot by Knipp in the second half<br />\nwas the prettiest play of the game. He was<br />\noff the ground and had to catch the ball on his<br />\noff-side. All the rest of the time he was so<br />\ncovered up that he had practically not a<br />\nsingle chance to show up in his usual<br />\nform, nor could he and Frank get in their<br />\nusual team-work.<br />\n<br />\nTHE PENN. RELAY RACE.<br />\nThe Thirteenth Annual Relay Race of the<br />\nUniversity of Pennsylvania was held at Franklin Field Saturday, April 27th. The Hopkins<br />\nteam, which took part, did not show up to as<br />\ngood an advantage as it did in the year previous. The team for some reason did not run<br />\nwith the vigor which it has shown in the past,<br />\nand, while the men did their best, there was<br />\nsomething wrong. Whether it was nervousness or not can not be said, but the past performances of the team pointed to better work.<br />\nThe race was exceptionally fast, and was<br />\neasily the second fastest of the day, being<br />\nbeaten only by the championships. Swarthmore led from the beginning with Ohio State<br />\nand Hopkins close behind; but at the finish<br />\nSwarthmore finished easily, with Ohio State<br />\nUniversity a bad second, closely pushed by<br />\nHopkins who finished third. The time was<br />\n3 minutes 30 2-5 seconds.<br />\nThe Hopkins team was composed of the<br />\nfollowing men, who ran in the order named:<br />\n<br />\n\fTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\n<br />\nPerce, Graves, Padgett and Treadway; substitute, Stewart.<br />\nThe trip up to Philadelphia was very enjoyable, and but few noteworthy events happened. It was noticed, however, that one of<br />\nthe squad was quite disappointed in the telephone service at the Bingham House; that<br />\none of the older men on the training squad<br />\ngot a shave (which he needed), and that the<br />\nleader of the bunch wrote but three letters on<br />\nthe whole trip, \"Mirable Dictu!\"<br />\nTHE HARVARD GAME.<br />\nThere was a rumor circulated around the<br />\nUniversity before the Harvard game that the<br />\nCrimsons had three Canadians playing on<br />\ntheir team, and were prepared to give us a<br />\nrub. This really seemed to be the truth, for<br />\nthe fellows from Cambridge started off with a<br />\nrush, scoring a goal in the first minute of<br />\nplay.<br />\nImmediately, the wiseacres began<br />\ntheir prophesying, but they were compelled to<br />\nchange their minds in a few minutes, when<br />\nthe wearers of the black and blue woke up.<br />\nThe game was won, all right, and won<br />\nhandily, but the playing of our team was not<br />\nall that might have been expected, and gave<br />\nthe coaches no little cause for alarm. The<br />\nstick-work was rather ragged, and the defense<br />\nplay was decidedly off. Havard's team was<br />\nbetter than last year's, although the scores<br />\nwere the same-7 to x. It was the first game<br />\nof the season for the visitors, and their shooting was decidedly off. Their midfield was<br />\nespecially good, with Wendell and Barber who<br />\nwere very fast and clever dodgers. Had they<br />\nhad more team play the story might have<br />\nbeen different.<br />\n<br />\nTHE LEHIGH GAME.<br />\nLehigh had beaten Mt. Washington the<br />\nweek before, and all indications were that they<br />\nwould beat us. Wonderful tales were told of<br />\nthe prowess of Carlock\u2014their goal keeper, and<br />\nof the ten seniors playing on the team. Well,<br />\neveryone knows the story. The first half was<br />\nexceptionally close, the score being 2 to i in<br />\nLehigh's favor. Time and again our attack<br />\nbore in on Lehigh's goal, and sent shots at<br />\nCarlock that it seemed no goal-keeper could<br />\n<br />\n9<br />\n<br />\nstop. Yet they could only land the ball once<br />\nin the net, for Carlock was always ready to<br />\nscoop the balls off to the side. In justice to<br />\nour fellows it must be said that only the<br />\nphenomenal work of the opposing goal prevented a larger score in the first half.<br />\nIn the second half, it was a different story.<br />\nOur attack had been working slightly up-bill<br />\nin the first half, but now they had the downhill. Carlock was no longer impregnable, and<br />\nour attack found his nulmerable spots to the<br />\ntune of ii goals. Moreover, in spite of a<br />\nchange in the defense, Lehigh's attack could<br />\nnot get through for any goals, and the game<br />\nended 12 to 2. The showing of the team was<br />\na gratifying surprise, and the fact that they<br />\nhad pulled up in the second half with the<br />\nscore against them was a cause for much commendation. The work of Knipp and Frank in<br />\nthis game was exceptional, there being nine<br />\ngoals to their credit.<br />\nThe game was a severe disappointment to<br />\nLehigh, for they thought they had a championship team. Carlock was their mainstay,<br />\nand had it not been for his exceptional playing,<br />\nthe game would have been won in the second<br />\nhalf. No criticism can be made of the rooting<br />\nat this game, except that it was rather discourteous to throw a lemon at Carlock. It is<br />\nto be hoped that no Hopkins rooter did this.<br />\n<br />\nUNIVERSITY NOTES.<br />\nThe banner won by last year's championship lacrosse team has made its appearance in<br />\nthe trophy room and helps swell the number,<br />\nmaking seven in all, of that particular brand.<br />\nEvery one hopes to see a 1907 banner there.<br />\nLevering Hall has never been so crowded<br />\nas when the circus parade passed by.

In short<br />\nthey promote \"college spirit.\" We regard these alone as sufficient<br />\nbenefits to the college to warrant their existance. We do not think<br />\nthey should be kept up simply to win games.

The men who have the<br />\nspirit, who have done the work, who carry with them the college support, and who can bring<br />\nit back again in years to come, are sitting on the benches or paying admission, while the game<br />\nis played by a club of unknown men, each from a different college, whose expenses are payed<br />\nby the undergraduates, and yet who do not care enough about Hopkins to learn our Hullabaloo.<br />\nWe understand that the baseball game with Washington and Lee was canceled because it was thought that right here in Baltimore, where we are supposedly back by our own<br />\ncollege, not enough gate money could be taken in to pay expenses.<br />\nIf this is the case, and such is the general attitude of the student body, the team ought<br />\nto be given up. It is not the function of our Athletic Association to support a baseball club,<br />\nand it is asking too much of our undergraduates to expect them to give money, time and effort<br />\nfor a team they do not know, and on which they cannot play.<br />\nNow, since it is the purpose of the Athletic Association to foster and not to kill<br />\nathletics, and especially to promote them in the form which they primarily exist, some such<br />\nruling should be made as shall make the majority, and therefore the character of our teams<br />\nundergraduate amature, not post-graduate and, in a certian sense, professional.<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br /><br />\n3<br /><br />\nHEREAS, There has risen with the return of spring a feeling of<br />\nadventure, or rather daredevilishness, among the members of the undergraduate body, and,<br />\nWHEREAS, several of the aforesaid undergraduates have given<br />\nvent to this rash feeling of adventure by tossing sundry coins upon<br />\nthe hallowed byways of our beloved campus, and,<br />\nWHEREAS, a fool and his money is soon parted, be it therefore,<br />\nResolved, That we, the undersigned members of the above mentioned undergraduate body, extend our heartfelt sympathy to those<br />\nwho have been so unfortunate as to retire poorer than they began,<br />\nand be it further,<br />\nResolved, That we show an evidence of our sorrow and sympathy, by inviting the unfortunates to come back into our rnidsts, and be it further,<br />\nResolved, That a copy of these resolutions be published in the NEWS-LETTER in hopes<br />\nof enticing more suckers to join in the game.<br />\nRICH HARD MCA/TERRY,<br />\nJAY MERRYMAN,<br />\nG.

At first sight the subject<br />\nwould seem to be a peculiarly \"spicy\" one,<br />\nand one which would produce quite a good<br />\ndeal of amusement. On the contrary, however, both sides found it rather carnbersome,<br />\nespecially as it is very much involved with<br />\nhazy law problems.<br />\nThe University was well represented by<br />\nMann, Lingewald and Holmes, who had made<br />\ntheir first acquaintance with the subject in the<br />\ninter-class debate. Virginia also had debated<br />\nthe question once before with Washington and<br />\nLee.<br />\nIn oratorical ability our men outclassed the<br />\nvisitors, whose sweet southern voices were<br />\nvery pleasing, but not quite forceful enough<br />\nin driving home upon the audience the realization of the \"outrageous condition of injustice, immorality and fraud existing under<br />\nthe present system of \"legalized polygamy.\"<br />\nThe Virginia men are to be congratulated,<br />\nhowever, on their ability at rebuttal, during<br />\nthe course of which they raised quite a good<br />\ndeal of \"thunder \"\u2014especially over the question of the birthday of the National Divorce<br />\nCongress.<br />\nBoth sides gave the divorce problem a<br />\nsevere overhauling, but neither enlightened us<br />\nmuch on the question of marriage, which<br />\nwould have been much more interesting, and<br />\ncertainly more instructive.<br />\nThere was the usual large and enthusiastic<br />\naudience which has helped to make the debates<br />\nso successful in the past. Dr. Retusen's<br />\naddress, the music contributed by the Glee and<br />\nMandolin clubs, not to mention the noise con-<br /><br />\n5<br /><br />\ntributed by the student body at large, helped<br />\nto make the debate most successful.<br />\nThe debate was fairly won and no one, I<br />\nthink, would dispute the decision\u2014least of<br />\nall, ourselves. The question, however, was<br />\nnot a good one, for the affirmative, as both the<br />\ninter-class and the University debates show,<br />\nwas laboring under an exceedingly heavy<br />\nburden of proof, which Virginia never succeeded in throwing off, although she announced<br />\nat the beginning that she had kindly pitched<br />\nit over on our shoulders.<br /><br />\nHOPKINS NIGHT.<br />\nA most enjoyable evening was spent at the<br />\ntheatre on Hopkins Night. Although we had<br />\nthe usual Hopkins weather\u2014raining or snowing\u2014there was present a large and fashionable<br />\naudience. All of the boxes were taken by<br />\nattractive young ladies from Bryn Mawr<br />\nSchool and the Woman's College. The orchestra chairs were nearly all occupied, and<br />\nthe first balcony was likewise filled. The<br />\nfirst two rows in the dress circle were held<br />\ndown by the Hopkins students who livened<br />\nthings up greatly between the acts and occasionally when the favorites in the cast appeared upon the stage.<br />\nThe actors and actresses certainty entered<br />\ninto the spirit of the occasion and were not<br />\nat all troubled by being interrupted in their<br />\nparts by yells. The Hopkins colors were<br />\nworn by several of the members of the company, and the large Hopkins banner occupied<br />\na prominent place on the merry-go-round.<br />\nThe theater, as usual, was very prettily<br />\ndecorated with the Hopkins flags and class<br />\nbanners. It is a very difficult task to decorate<br />\nthe theatre, and those who did the work<br />\ndeserve a great deal of credit.<br />\nA new feature was instituted at this Hopkins Night by having an alumnus make an<br />\ninformal address between the acts. We enjoyed the speech very much, and are greatly<br />\nindebted to Mr. Stuart Symington. We hope<br />\nthat this custom will be continued at all the<br />\nHopkins Nights next year. Then, too, there<br />\nwere very pretty souvenir programs printed<br />\nfor the occasion.<br />\nAs to the show itself, we must admit that it<br />\nwas no better than the general run of comic<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br /><br />\n6<br /><br />\noperas, although the plot was absolutely<br />\noriginal. There were several catchy songs in<br />\nthe show. Mr. Bulger was just as entertaining as ever, and both Miss Snider and Miss<br />\nFisher were very attractive and sang very<br />\nwell. The chorus, however, was still in need<br />\nof more drilling.<br />\nNow, to the business side of the occasion.<br />\nWe understand that although there was a considerable amount of money taken in, the expenses were very heavy, and the Hullaballoo<br />\nBoard and the Athletic Association did not<br />\nmake as much money as they expected. We<br />\nhear that not more than one hundred dollars<br />\nwas cleared altogether. It seems too bad that<br />\nwe can not make more of a success out of<br />\nthese Hopkins Nights. Notwithstanding the<br />\nfact that it was not a success from the financial<br />\nstandpoint, it most assuredly was from the<br />\nsocial side, and for that reason, if nothing<br />\nmore, Hopkins Nights should be given often<br />\nnext year.<br /><br />\nCHESS CLUB.<br />\nThe Chess Club has about completed a busy<br />\nand successful season. Much interest has<br />\nbeen displayed in the Royal game in the<br />\nUniversity this year, especially among the<br />\nfreshmen, a number of whom joined the club.<br />\nThere were two tourneys; the Major was won<br />\nby B.

Washington game was a disappointment to rooters and team alike. After the<br />\nteam bad won superbly from Lehigh in the<br />\nsecond half of their game, everybody looked<br />\nfor Hopkins to beat the Mountaineers, and<br />\nthere was plenty of Hopkins money. Everyone knows the story of the game, and it is<br />\nuseless to dwell upon unpleasant details. The<br />\nMt. Washington defense was \" wise,\" and<br />\nmade it their whole business to cover up Knipp<br />\nand Frank. With those two out of the game,<br />\nthe rest of the attack were at sea, and did not<br />\nknow what to do. The clever dodging of<br />\nEstes was responsible for more than one of Mt.<br />\nWashington's goal, and it is up to our defense<br />\nto correct this error.<br />\nThe goal shot by Knipp in the second half<br />\nwas the prettiest play of the game. He was<br />\noff the ground and had to catch the ball on his<br />\noff-side. All the rest of the time he was so<br />\ncovered up that he had practically not a<br />\nsingle chance to show up in his usual<br />\nform, nor could he and Frank get in their<br />\nusual team-work.<br /><br />\nTHE PENN. RELAY RACE.<br />\nThe Thirteenth Annual Relay Race of the<br />\nUniversity of Pennsylvania was held at Franklin Field Saturday, April 27th. The Hopkins<br />\nteam, which took part, did not show up to as<br />\ngood an advantage as it did in the year previous. The team for some reason did not run<br />\nwith the vigor which it has shown in the past,<br />\nand, while the men did their best, there was<br />\nsomething wrong. Whether it was nervousness or not can not be said, but the past performances of the team pointed to better work.<br />\nThe race was exceptionally fast, and was<br />\neasily the second fastest of the day, being<br />\nbeaten only by the championships. Swarthmore led from the beginning with Ohio State<br />\nand Hopkins close behind; but at the finish<br />\nSwarthmore finished easily, with Ohio State<br />\nUniversity a bad second, closely pushed by<br />\nHopkins who finished third. The time was<br />\n3 minutes 30 2-5 seconds.<br />\nThe Hopkins team was composed of the<br />\nfollowing men, who ran in the order named:<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br /><br />\nPerce, Graves, Padgett and Treadway; substitute, Stewart.<br />\nThe trip up to Philadelphia was very enjoyable, and but few noteworthy events happened. It was noticed, however, that one of<br />\nthe squad was quite disappointed in the telephone service at the Bingham House; that<br />\none of the older men on the training squad<br />\ngot a shave (which he needed), and that the<br />\nleader of the bunch wrote but three letters on<br />\nthe whole trip, \"Mirable Dictu!\"<br />\nTHE HARVARD GAME.<br />\nThere was a rumor circulated around the<br />\nUniversity before the Harvard game that the<br />\nCrimsons had three Canadians playing on<br />\ntheir team, and were prepared to give us a<br />\nrub. This really seemed to be the truth, for<br />\nthe fellows from Cambridge started off with a<br />\nrush, scoring a goal in the first minute of<br />\nplay.<br />\nImmediately, the wiseacres began<br />\ntheir prophesying, but they were compelled to<br />\nchange their minds in a few minutes, when<br />\nthe wearers of the black and blue woke up.<br />\nThe game was won, all right, and won<br />\nhandily, but the playing of our team was not<br />\nall that might have been expected, and gave<br />\nthe coaches no little cause for alarm. The<br />\nstick-work was rather ragged, and the defense<br />\nplay was decidedly off. Havard's team was<br />\nbetter than last year's, although the scores<br />\nwere the same-7 to x. It was the first game<br />\nof the season for the visitors, and their shooting was decidedly off. Their midfield was<br />\nespecially good, with Wendell and Barber who<br />\nwere very fast and clever dodgers. Had they<br />\nhad more team play the story might have<br />\nbeen different.<br /><br />\nTHE LEHIGH GAME.<br />\nLehigh had beaten Mt. Washington the<br />\nweek before, and all indications were that they<br />\nwould beat us. Wonderful tales were told of<br />\nthe prowess of Carlock\u2014their goal keeper, and<br />\nof the ten seniors playing on the team. Well,<br />\neveryone knows the story. The first half was<br />\nexceptionally close, the score being 2 to i in<br />\nLehigh's favor. Time and again our attack<br />\nbore in on Lehigh's goal, and sent shots at<br />\nCarlock that it seemed no goal-keeper could<br /><br />\n9<br /><br />\nstop. Yet they could only land the ball once<br />\nin the net, for Carlock was always ready to<br />\nscoop the balls off to the side. In justice to<br />\nour fellows it must be said that only the<br />\nphenomenal work of the opposing goal prevented a larger score in the first half.<br />\nIn the second half, it was a different story.<br />\nOur attack had been working slightly up-bill<br />\nin the first half, but now they had the downhill. Carlock was no longer impregnable, and<br />\nour attack found his nulmerable spots to the<br />\ntune of ii goals. Moreover, in spite of a<br />\nchange in the defense, Lehigh's attack could<br />\nnot get through for any goals, and the game<br />\nended 12 to 2. The showing of the team was<br />\na gratifying surprise, and the fact that they<br />\nhad pulled up in the second half with the<br />\nscore against them was a cause for much commendation. The work of Knipp and Frank in<br />\nthis game was exceptional, there being nine<br />\ngoals to their credit.<br />\nThe game was a severe disappointment to<br />\nLehigh, for they thought they had a championship team. Carlock was their mainstay,<br />\nand had it not been for his exceptional playing,<br />\nthe game would have been won in the second<br />\nhalf. No criticism can be made of the rooting<br />\nat this game, except that it was rather discourteous to throw a lemon at Carlock. It is<br />\nto be hoped that no Hopkins rooter did this.<br /><br />\nUNIVERSITY NOTES.<br />\nThe banner won by last year's championship lacrosse team has made its appearance in<br />\nthe trophy room and helps swell the number,<br />\nmaking seven in all, of that particular brand.<br />\nEvery one hopes to see a 1907 banner there.<br />\nLevering Hall has never been so crowded<br />\nas when the circus parade passed by.
