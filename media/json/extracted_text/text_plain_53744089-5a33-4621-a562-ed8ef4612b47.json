In fact, the SAC's<br />\nmost recent constitution allows the SC President only an<br />\nex-officio membership on the full panel, but-under current<br />\npractice he serves as a voting member of its all-powerful<br />\nexecutive offshoot.<br />\nSecond, the Council itself, whose constitution grants it<br />\nauthority to investigate all campusaCtivities, has been in<br />\nviolation of its charter's election provisions, as even SC<br />\nPresident Andrew W. Savitz has admitted. _<br />\nGranted that the Council's activities are not of<br />\noverwhelming importance, anyway, it does seem a little<br />\nironic that the supposed watchdog group casually ignores its<br />\nown by-laws. Far more important, however, is the matter of<br />\nthe Student Activities Commission, which is reponsible for<br />\nallocating student activities money. Since the future of many<br />\nstudent groups depends on what that panel decides, it is<br />\ninexcusable for it to choose casually to operate as its<br />\nconvenience may require. The panel much choose between<br />\nreturning to operation under its only written constitution or<br />\nto writing itself a new one. But while it is trying to decide<br />\nwhat to do, its has no choice but to return to operations<br />\nunder the old charter, the group's only legal base for<br />\nexistence.<br />\n<br />\nAlthough when you arrive at<br />\nHopkins, you are told of your<br />\nmembership in a certain graduating<br />\nclass, the distinction rarely comes<br />\nup after you freshman year until<br />\nyou are a senior.

Although its rather difficult to get excited<br />\nabout the Constitution itself, this document is ultimately The American<br />\nstatments of what goes and what doesn't, its implications in questions<br />\nof reform and control in governments and society are extremely<br />\nimportant. In a series of speakers ranging from respected to notorious,<br />\nor both depending on your own position, speaking on a number of<br />\ncrucial issues, we will attempt to examine the role of the Constitution,<br />\nand implicitly our government itself, in American society.<br /><br />\n1<br /><br />\nPERSPECTIVES IN HUMAN SEXUALITY<br />\nThis topic has vast possibilities due to the several disciplines that can<br />\nbe involved. We plan to inbite authoritative and well-known speakers to<br />\ndiscuss human sexuality from each of several perspect<br />\nive/4<br />\nphysiological, psychbiological, literary, anthropological, historic, socia<br />\nl<br />\nbiological, mythographic, psychological, as well as ecological. A<br />\ngood<br />\npresentation ofsthe subject will require a mix of speakers of diiff<br />\nerent<br />\npoints of view. Because of the many, recent developmentssin the<br />\nfield,<br />\nthis topic proves to be one of timely scientific and social interest.

In each of its<br />\nfour two-day segments, covering two weeks, such major issues as the<br />\neconomy, foreign policy, universities, and civil right will be presente<br />\nd<br />\nand debated. On the first day of each segment, a renowned Marxist will<br />\nlecture on a particular problem. The second day, the Marxist will<br />\nconduct a morning seminar for students, followed by an afternoon<br />\ndiscussion between the Marxist and a Capitalsit counterpart.

In fact, the SAC's<br />\nmost recent constitution allows the SC President only an<br />\nex-officio membership on the full panel, but-under current<br />\npractice he serves as a voting member of its all-powerful<br />\nexecutive offshoot.<br />\nSecond, the Council itself, whose constitution grants it<br />\nauthority to investigate all campusaCtivities, has been in<br />\nviolation of its charter's election provisions, as even SC<br />\nPresident Andrew W. Savitz has admitted. _<br />\nGranted that the Council's activities are not of<br />\noverwhelming importance, anyway, it does seem a little<br />\nironic that the supposed watchdog group casually ignores its<br />\nown by-laws. Far more important, however, is the matter of<br />\nthe Student Activities Commission, which is reponsible for<br />\nallocating student activities money. Since the future of many<br />\nstudent groups depends on what that panel decides, it is<br />\ninexcusable for it to choose casually to operate as its<br />\nconvenience may require. The panel much choose between<br />\nreturning to operation under its only written constitution or<br />\nto writing itself a new one. But while it is trying to decide<br />\nwhat to do, its has no choice but to return to operations<br />\nunder the old charter, the group's only legal base for<br />\nexistence.<br /><br />\nAlthough when you arrive at<br />\nHopkins, you are told of your<br />\nmembership in a certain graduating<br />\nclass, the distinction rarely comes<br />\nup after you freshman year until<br />\nyou are a senior. I don't know why<br />\n- it must be springtime nostalgia.<br />\nWell, it was at one of those class<br />\nencounters held to decide what to<br />\ndo about class funds and<br />\ngraduation, that the suggestion was<br />\nmade first from a member of the<br />\nWomen's Center and then from the<br />\nBlack Student Union that a<br />\nrepresentative from each of their<br />\ngroups be allowed to present short<br />\nmessages during their diploma<br />\nceremony on commencement day.<br />\nAnd although there were the few<br />\nexpected complaints, most people<br />\nwere sufficiently intimidated to let<br />\nit slide. One guy behind me,<br />\nassenting, said that he could see<br />\nthe sense in it because these were to quote him inexactly - \"groups<br />\nthat really changed the life around<br />\nhere during the past few years.<br />\nEspecially the women.

There were,<br />\nhowever, the curiosity pieces of<br />\nthe handful of commuting students<br />\nwho represented the first inroads<br />\nof womankind. They were visible<br />\nin the history of art classes and<br />\nEnglish classes and were even<br />\nspotted, in isolated instances, in<br /><br />\nAnd they played real good<br /><br />\ninorganic chemistry classes. There<br />\nwere attempts to turn them into<br />\ncheerleaders - I'm not kidding - and<br />\nthe results during that dismal<br />\n.lacrosse season were appropriately<br />\ndismal.<br />\nTwo of these pioneers live next<br />\ndoor now and one more down the<br />\nhall. If prompted, they will try to<br />\nremember the other members of<br />\nthe stout-hearted group with a<br />\n\"What ever happened to so-andso?\" Surprisingly, they seem quite<br />\nhappy, well-educated, and none<br />\nthe worse for their four-year<br />\nexperience at Hopkins. If they had<br />\ngone to Princeton or Yale, they<br />\nwould have been quoted in articles<br />\nfor the New York Times Magazine.<br />\nBut, since they came here, this is<br />\nthe most tribute I can give them.<br />\nAlthough they deserve better.<br />\nBut what's the point ofs this?<br />\nWhy dig up all this fuzzy historical<br />\nstuff when we are in the midst of a<br />\ndynamic new age here complete<br />\nwith Student Union, movies, and<br />\ndances? Well, since one doesn't<br />\nbring up a question like that<br />\nwithout an answer ready, I have<br />\nthe answer: because an old era is<br />\ncoming to a close, and I think it is<br />\nimportant not to forget. I'd hate to<br />\nthink of the Hopkins Renaissance<br />\nwiping out all traces of us Gothic<br />\nforbearers.<br />\nIt's not just that my pioneer<br />\nneigh hors are graduating; that<br />\nMindy Farber is graduating; that<br />\nMarli Weiner is graduating; that<br />\nEmily Toth is finishing up her<br />\ndoctoral disseration and will be<br />\nleaving; that the whole pantheon<br />\nof early martyrs will soon be gone it's just that there is no one left<br />\nbehind who will remember. This is.<br /><br />\nthe end. of the set and provided<br />\nperhaps the strongest performance<br />\nof the evening. The possessor of a<br />\nstrong, clear voice, Haymes<br />\nrendered several original songs but<br />\nalso drew heavily on John<br />\nSebastian material towards the end<br />\nof his set. This modest singer<br />\nsucceeded superlatively in elicitng<br />\nan aesthetic reponse from his<br />\nlisteners, even managing to engage<br /><br />\nwork with crowd-pleasers from<br />\nway back, never allowing the show<br />\nto go down the road to monotony'<br />\nwhence it cannot be retrieved.<br />\nHaymes left.

All the women<br />\ncrusaders, and most of their<br />\nadversaries, will no longer be here.<br />\nThe women's center will most<br />\nlikely die a quiet, serene death. But<br />\nit is important that the women<br />\nwho come here in the future - even<br />\nthe women enjoying themselves<br />\nhere already - realize that it was<br />\nnot always so easy: that they were<br />\nnot always so welcome. All the<br />\nIrregular Periodicals, Mae West<br />\nFilm Series, orientation receptions,<br />\nelection campaigns, meetings with<br />\nofficials, speakers, and even<br />\nfestivals will be unimportant and<br />\nmerely archival. They were just<br />\nattempts to do something - to fit<br />\nin. But the total effect was<br />\nsomething that mill be felt for the<br /><br />\nemerged from scrutiny as little<br />\nmore than a second-rate Shawn<br />\nPhillips imitation, replete as it was<br />\nwith the transcendental appeals<br />\nand stream-of-consciousness lyrics.<br />\nIn retrospect, all that was missing<br />\nwas the double-necked guitar.

A lot of hard<br />\nfeelings.

Hopkins was<br />\nunawed in either count, winning<br />\nthe match easily while Bob<br />\nBaum, Mike Brunner, and Glenn<br />\nPantel tipped their foil trio.<br /><br />\nJunior sabreman Bruce<br />\nLivingston won all three of his<br />\nbouts in the Drew match and<br />\nadded a victory against Lafayette<br />\nto bring his season record to<br />\n39-11. That ties him with<br />\nco-capitain John Roberts who<br />\nalso is on the sabre trio, for high<br />\nman among the squad's regulars.<br />\nBaum is the third man on this list<br />\nwith a 33-1 2 mark in foil<br />\ncompetition.<br />\nWolves<br />\nAnother leading swordsman on<br />\nthe varsity is substitutue sabre<br />\nJeff Spear, a sophomore who has<br />\ncompiled a 13-1 record.

In the<br />\npast his teams had suffered for<br />\nlack of depth, but that has not<br />\nbeen a factor this season. \"It's<br />\nthe kind of problem I hope to<br />\nkeep on having.\" he added.<br />\nMuch of the fencing success is<br />\ndirectly attirubtable to Oles<br />\nhimself, as is seen in the fact that<br />\nof the top twelve swordsmen on<br />\nthe team only four had any<br />\nexperience before joining the<br />\nHopkins squad.
