The<br />\nidea seems to be a good one, filling a large void on the<br />\ncampus. There are few activities at Hopkins that<br />\nappeal to all segments of the University community,<br />\nand, indeed, the absence of such popular functions<br />\ncontributes to the lack of that community. The Spring<br />\nFestival, as it is currently formulated, seems designed<br />\nto attract as wide an audience as possible. It would<br />\nundoubtedly be a pleasant diversion for the upcoming<br />\nwarm weather, one that could be enjoyed by all<br />\nsegments of the University.<br />\nIn its place, dissident Council members want to put<br />\na concert, and plan a Big Spring Weekend. The<br />\nconcert, with its Aquarian age popularity, would<br />\nappeal to one segment of the community, while the<br />\nLacrosse game and dance and such would attract its<br />\nusual fraternity fans. There seems to be reason to<br />\nreplace the Spring Festival with events of such limited<br />\nappeal.<br />\nThis lack of valid justification for the move was<br />\nreflected in the manner in the actions of the Council.<br />\nVoting one way then another, the Council apparently<br />\nmisunderstood their own proposals.

If Hopkins' professors begin to<br />\ndevote their time and academic energies to teaching<br />\nundergraduates, then the courses that undergraduates<br />\nneed for a liberal arts education will follow. Even<br />\nwithin the structure of the traditional program,<br />\nsignificantly improved teaching would right a great<br />\ndeal of the current wrong. It is also refreshing that the<br />\nBRP has been brave enough to call for the inclusion of<br />\nstudents in the evaluation of teaching.<br />\n, -A pleasant surprise was the inclusion of<br />\nrecommendations for changes in the non-academic<br />\nareas of the undergraduate's life. Apparently swayed<br />\nby the strong response it recieved from its poll, the<br />\nBRP made this topic a major subject of its report.<br />\nHere, too, its recommendation for the Dean of<br />\nStudents is worthy of praise. But more importantly, it<br />\nis significant that the BRP recognized and pointed out<br />\nto the Academic Council many of the concerns of the<br />\nundergraduates in this area. \"The faculty and<br />\nadministration must realize that undergraduates are<br />\nnot graduate students in disguise\" to quote the report.<br />\nAfter this one pleasant surprise, it would be very<br />\nnice to have another \u2014 quick action by the Academic<br />\nCouncil to implement the recommendations.<br />\n<br />\n'lle-Eleet Nixon'!\"<br />\n<br />\n\u2022.c:Fz .<br />\nt<br />\n<br />\n4,comtvr<br />\nLov.$ foST\u2022pitfilVoi<br />\n<br />\n(Herblock i.s on vacation)<br />\n<br />\nOpinion<br />\n<br />\nTermpapers<br />\nThe inaction of those organizations<br />\nand persons responsible for protecting<br />\nthe academic and moral integrity of The<br />\nJohns Hopkins University and its<br />\ncommunity was the spark which<br />\nmotivated us to take on the drive to<br />\nuphold the interests of this institution.<br />\nHad all persons officially entrusted with<br />\nthis obligation acted responsibly and used<br />\nall means in their jurisdiction and power<br />\nto eliminate the fraudulent use of term<br />\npapers at Hopkins, we ourselves would<br />\nnot have been compelled to take on this<br />\n,task.

Kubrick tries to<br />\njustify the violence in the movie by<br />\nrelegating it to \"the sense of the times.\"<br />\nThe setting is a visualization of the<br />\nfuture, like Kubrick's past works, \"Dr.<br />\nStrangelove\" and \"2001.\" In \"Orange,\"<br />\nhowever, he chooses to film a society<br />\nwhich is repulsively real, one which<br />\ncannot be put out of one's mind as easily<br />\nas in other movies.<br />\nKubrick's treatment of the<br />\nscience-fiction novel upon which this<br />\nmovie is based can be seen as overkill or<br />\nas mastery of the screen's power; his<br />\nexcessive use of classical music, often at a<br />\ndeafening pitch, is a factor which<br />\n<br />\ngave Coleman's audience an opportunity<br />\nto hear how an author intends his<br />\nunconventional expressions to be<br />\ninunciated: \"Plunk!/Shock to the<br />\nstomach./Plunk! Plunk!/Shock to the<br />\nheart.\" Several people commented<br />\nafterwards that the shocks could be felt<br />\nas he read. The types of connections<br />\nbetween the words seemed to be as<br />\nimportant as the words themselves.<br />\n\"Proses out of the Deep\" and \"Proses<br />\nout of the Blue\" which followed were<br />\nmore personal compositions. After a<br />\npause and adjustment of his glasses,<br />\nColeman spoke about the \"fearful and<br />\ndelicious sense that someone we do not<br />\nknow is suffering\" as he gave a spirited<br />\nand entertaining reading of \"Sirens.\"<br />\nHe held up his typed copy of \"White<br />\nCoral\" before he read it to point out that<br />\nit was structured much like coral. Both<br />\nhe and his audience were by this time<br />\n<br />\nscien,ce-fiction<br />\n<br />\nporno-violertee<br />\n<br />\nweakens the movie by allowing it to rely<br />\ntoo much on the heavy emotion inherent<br />\nin works by Beethoven and Rossini.<br />\nOther tricks with the camera and the<br />\nsoundtrack make \"Orange\" a very slick<br />\nfilm, as in the speeded-up sequence of an<br />\nerotic menage a trois, done to the<br />\nthunderous strains of the \"William Tell<br />\nOverture.'<br />\nFuture Society<br />\nThe vision of a future society which<br />\nKubrick interprets in his film is close and<br />\ndistant to ours at the same time. The<br />\npolitics are very similar, the dress and<br />\nenvironment just different enough to<br />\nmake it seem far-away, and the<br />\n\"ultraviolence\" is timeless sadism, rape,<br />\nassault and murder, thrown at you<br />\ngraphically and constantly.<br />\nMalcolm McDowell's performance as<br />\nAlex, the leader of the quartet of thugs,<br />\nis done with smashing arrogance. His<br />\naffinity for foraying out to the country<br />\nwith his gang and brutalizing the<br />\noccupants of beautiful houses is<br />\npsychologically unequalled in other films.<br />\n<br />\nHis dominance of the rest of his gang,<br />\nmostly by physical means, is convincing.<br />\n<br />\n'Feminist' theatre draws heated feminist objection<br />\nBy KATHY CAMPBELL<br />\n\"You can be wife, slut, whore, slave.<br />\nThink it over twice. The man with the<br />\nwhip knows best.\"<br />\n(from The Authority Song, lyrics by<br />\nArthur Morey, music by Bobby Paul).<br />\nThe New Feminist Theater<br />\nperformance at Towson State College on<br />\nFriday night was an unexciting, if<br />\nartistically adequate selection of songs<br />\nand patter until, as the troupe took their<br />\nbows, four women from the audience<br />\nwalked onto the stage protesting that the<br />\nshow was a \"sexist rip-off.\"<br />\nMolly Head, a student at Antioch<br />\ncollege and one of the women who<br />\nconfronted the performers, said that she<br />\nobjected to the group's describing itself<br />\nas \"feminist\", though two of the !bur<br />\nperformers were men and all the songs<br />\nwere written by the men. She said, \"I<br />\nresent the fact that everything was<br />\nwritten by men about women's feelings.<br />\nWe know what we feel; we don't need to<br />\nbe told.\"<br />\nThe four performers, Anselma<br />\ndell'Olio, Lady Walquer, Arthur Morey<br />\nand Bobby Paul, remained onstage to<br />\nanswer the women and others in the<br />\n<br />\naudience. They also heard some men and<br />\nwomen in the audience react favorably to<br />\ntheir performance.<br />\nAudience Divided<br />\nIn describing the way the show is put<br />\ntogether, dell'Olio said, \"we work<br />\ncollaboratively and collectively.\" Arthur<br />\nMorey, describing the same process, said,<br />\n\"Anselma tells me what's going on, I go<br />\nand write the lyrics and Bobby writes the<br />\nmusic.\" dell'Olio said that she had<br />\napproached several women songwriters,<br />\nbut that none were interested in working<br />\nwith her in women's theater.<br />\nThe audience seemed evenly divided<br />\nbetween those who objected to the<br />\nperformance and those who approved or<br />\n'who didn't care. One man got up to say<br />\nthat for a theater group to be criticized<br />\nfor the politics of their performance,\"for<br />\nsomeone to tell them what they should<br />\ndo onstage, seems like fascism to me.\"<br />\nSeveral women arose to say that they<br />\nhad expected something quite different, a<br />\nperformance by a feminist theater group,<br />\nand that they were angry at the<br />\ndeception. Several on them were<br />\napplauded by a substantial minority of<br />\nthe audience.<br />\n<br />\nThe performance and ensuing<br />\ndiscussion were videotaped by a group of<br />\nAntioch students. One of the crew<br />\nworking in the project said she didn't<br />\nthink the performance was even worth<br />\narguing over.<br />\nA number of women seemed to feel<br />\nthat the issue was not political or artistic<br />\nbut commercial: deceptive packaging and<br />\ndeceptive advertising. One woman said<br />\nthat she had seen a flyer saying that the<br />\ngroup's appearance was sponsored by a<br />\nWoman's Liberation group, and that she<br />\nhad come for that reason, to see a<br />\nwomen's movement show. Another<br />\nwoman said that she had bought a $3.00<br />\nregular ticket, instead of the $2.00<br />\nstudent ticket because she thought the<br />\nmoney was going to a women's<br />\nmovement group. She said she was going<br />\nto demand her money back.<br />\nMany of the women in the audience<br />\nwere with other women, either in pairs or<br />\ngroups. Several objected to put-downs of<br />\nlesbians.<br />\nIn the song \"Hilda\", about a<br />\nprostitute, her slide into the lower depths<br />\nis described: \"First she had a husband,<br />\n<br />\nthen there was a pusher, then there were<br />\ndozens, and now she loves a woman. She<br />\ndoesn't know how she got there and she<br />\nhates every moment.\"<br />\nThis seemed to some women to<br />\nassociate woman-to-woman love with<br />\ndrug addiction and other degradations.<br />\nThey challanged this idea.<br />\nDell'Olio replied that she was only<br />\nrepresenting reality, that many<br />\nprostitutes were in fact, lesbians. She<br />\nadded,\"Women turn to other women out<br />\nof desperation\". Several women in the<br />\naudience groaned or hissed.<br />\n'No Chocolate Chippy'<br />\nMany of the songs portrayed women as<br />\nmasochists, playing the role of<br />\nlong-suffering martyrs but putting up<br />\nwith it.<br />\nOne song, \"Penelope\", describes a<br />\nwoman's day after her husband leaves in<br />\nthe morning and before he comes home<br />\nat night. She sits and spins monotonously<br />\nall day. Of herself she says, \"I'm a<br />\nfaithful wife, it's a hateful life.\"<br />\nOther songs describe the carefree,<br />\nheartless, peccadiloes of men.<br />\n\"Billy Yank\" impregnates his woman<br />\nand then puts to sea: \"That's the way of<br />\n<br />\naccustomed to hearing his voice through<br />\na microphone, and Coleman appeared to<br />\nenjoy his reading as much as his listeners.<br />\nThe last composition was a sestina, a<br />\ncomplex Italian verse form, framed by a<br />\none-stanza hymn and a closing lyric. He<br />\nmodestly apologized beforehand, saying<br />\nthat although he had never really wanted<br />\nto write a sestina, the fact that some of<br />\nhis undergraduate students were turning<br />\nthem in meant that he felt he should at<br />\nleast try. But no one seemed at all<br />\ndisappointed with the content or reading<br />\nof \"Requiem.\" A copy of it can be found<br />\nwith the exhibit of photographs now in<br />\nthe upper level of the library.<br />\nThe introduction given to Coleman by<br />\nSherry Gill, head of the Wednesday Noon<br />\nSeries, seemed even more appropriate as<br />\nthe applause ended: \"He writes<br />\nmarvelous poetry and is gentle and<br />\nempathic.\"<br />\n<br />\na Boston girl; down they go and up they<br />\nswell.\"<br />\n\"Black Xantippe\" is described by her<br />\nlover, a bemused whitey dipping his pen<br />\ntentatively in black ink: \"Oh, my black<br />\nXantippe, she's no chocolate chippy\"<br />\nRip-off<br />\nIn the \"Duet for Wife and Mistress\",<br />\nthe women trade anecdotes about the<br />\nfaithlessness of their men; \"Some he<br />\nloves for minds and hearts, some he loves<br />\nfor other parts\". But each woman<br />\nremains alone in her oppression. There is<br />\nno sharing, no sisterhood, and no way<br />\nout.<br />\nThe only exciting songs were three<br />\nItalian women workers' songs about<br />\nbeing downtrodden and worked to death,<br />\nbut sworn to revenge. \"Sisters\" calls<br />\nwomen to unite against their masters.<br />\nGood socialism as well as good feminism.<br />\nThe New Feminist Theater is to the<br />\nWomen's Movement as Peter Max is to<br />\nthe Counter-culture. It's too bad so many<br />\npeople had to pay $3.00 each to discover<br />\nit. Said one woman, \"The hippie<br />\nmovement got capitalized on. This is the<br />\nbeginning of the exploitation of the<br />\nWomen's movement.\"<br />\n<br />\nAll tifese nasty traits are eradicated by<br />\na horrifying treatment that makes Alex<br />\nphysically sick at the sight of sex and<br />\nviolence. Kubrick works our emotions to<br />\nmake us despise those who would<br />\ncondition Alex\u2014and all men. So, in many<br />\nways, it is a profoundly anarchistic film.<br />\nThe film is essentially done in three<br />\nstages, each characterized by its own<br />\nbrand of violence; there are the Droogs<br />\n(as the members of the gangs refer to<br />\ntheir comrades) and their rapes and<br />\nmuggings; there is Alex's punishment in<br />\nan enormous jail complex, and his<br />\nselection for the futuristic, experimental<br />\naversion therapy which frees him in a<br />\nfortnight, safe for society; and there is<br />\nAlex's retribution when he is<br />\nfreed\u2014conditioned to retch at the<br />\nthought of violence or sex, and<br />\naccidentally, Beethoven's 9th, he<br />\nencounters the old drunk he once beat<br />\nup, who replies in kind with the aid of his<br />\nfellow drunks. He comes upon two<br />\npolicemen who turn out to be old<br />\nDroogs, and take him out in the country,<br />\nleaving him half-dead. He stumbles into<br />\nthe house of a liberal writer, whose wife<br />\nhe raped, and after being recognized, is<br />\nlocked in a room and made to listen to<br />\nBeethoven's 9th, which makes him so<br />\nsick he attempts suicide.<br />\nJustice<br />\nKubrick's treatment of the moral and<br />\npoetic justice in this last stage is marred<br />\nat the end of the movie, when he escapes<br />\nresponsibility and message by resorting to<br />\nthe irreverent and obscure, disguised with<br />\nsome confusing symbolism. It might be<br />\nthat he wrongly equates sex with<br />\nviolence, whereas the novel distinguished<br />\nbetween them, or it might be that<br />\nKubrick, in a sense, simply copped out,<br />\nas he did in 2001, by a simple reversion<br />\nwhich leaves you ambivalent about the<br />\nintent of the movie.<br />\n\"A Clockwork Orange\" includes some<br />\nvery good acting, a somewhat<br />\noverwrought sense of the dramatic,<br />\nseveral quite funny scenes, and a facet of<br />\nviolence which is truly pornographic. It is<br />\na strong statement, but one cannot be<br />\nsure of what. It is well-filmed, hypnotic,<br />\nscary and repellent. Finally, like movies<br />\nin general, it is averse to being discussed<br />\nin any other media than film, and your<br />\nonly choice becomes whether to go see or<br />\nnot.<br />\n<br />\n\fpage 8/news-letter/march 3, 1972<br />\nTHE JEWISH STUDENTS ASSOCIATION<br />\n<br />\nMulti-media show here<br />\n\"To Look for America,\" a<br />\ntraveling multi-media show<br />\norganized by a professor of<br />\nhistory will be presented this<br />\nafternoon at 12:45 p.m. in<br />\nShaffer Hall.<br />\nLeon F.

The Blue Jays are in.<br />\nthird position, behind Lebanon<br />\nValley and PMC and ahead of \u2022<br />\nDickinson College. The team that<br />\nwins the league playoffs will<br />\nproceed into the second round of<br />\ncompetition in Akron, Ohio.<br />\nAlthough Lebanon Valley<br />\nfinished first in the league, PMC<br />\nhas been picked as the<br />\npre -tournament favorite. They<br />\nhave the home court advantage as<br />\nwell as the best individual player<br />\nin the league, Wally Rice. Rice,<br />\nwho stands six feet three inches<br />\ntall, is backed by a big, strong<br />\n<br />\nteam. With the front line<br />\naveraging more than six feet six<br />\ninches, the team stands agood<br />\nchance of taking it all.<br />\nLebanon Valley's success rests<br />\nmainly on their tremendous team<br />\nplay. They work together, hit the<br />\nopen man, and play aggressive<br />\ndefense. A quick fast break<br />\nhighlights their offense and the<br />\nbig men pitch the ball well.<br />\nDickinson had a fine offense<br />\nall season long.

Bucky fences sabre,<br />\nand frequently makes an effort<br />\nto get into the true spirit of the<br />\nevent. Constantly shouting \"et<br />\n-la\" (the French expression for<br />\n\"and there\"), Bucky likes to<br />\nparalyze his opponent with<br />\nnumerous head, body, and leg<br />\nfeints.<br />\nRoberts, on the other hand, is<br />\na much more conservative fencer<br />\nand has long been Coach Oles'<br />\nchief utility man, switching from<br />\nepee to foil in the beginning and<br />\nfinally back to epee this season.<br />\nIngram said that he became<br />\ninterested in the fencing program<br />\nmainly through hi & own<br />\ncuriosity. He said that many of<br />\nthe students in his dormitory<br />\nfreshman year went out for the<br />\n<br />\nteam, hut all quit except for him.<br />\nBoth co-captains believe that a<br />\ngood fencer must employ 50%<br />\nphysical and 50% mental strategy<br />\nin his bouts. To fence well, he<br />\nneeds good timing. balance,<br />\nquick<br />\ncoordination, and Ivor.<br />\n<br />\nKeith Bucklen<br />\nreactions. There must be sure<br />\ncoordination between the<br />\nfencer's hands and feet if he is to<br />\nbe successful.<br />\nBucklen likens the sport to a<br />\nmental chess game and a physical<br />\nballet. Bucky is especially a<br />\nstudent of the mental art. He<br />\n<br />\nalways tries to stare down an<br />\nopponent before the match gets<br />\nunderway. Bucklen then<br />\ncontinues to keep his opponent<br />\noff balance and scared<br />\nthroughout the match.<br />\nBucky concedes, though, that<br />\nthe show a fencer puts on may be<br />\ninsignificant since the weakest<br />\nfencer is usually the one most<br />\neasily affected by a stare, a<br />\nscowl, or even a yell.<br />\nBoth Keith Bucklen and<br />\nIngram Roberts were proud of<br />\n'their performance this year.<br />\n<br />\nIngram Roberts<br />\n<br />\nStickmen to scrimmage Md.

The Baby Jays<br />\nnetted 45% of their shots from<br />\nthe floor and pulled down an<br />\naverage of 51 rebounds a game.<br />\n<br />\nThe rebounding strength was<br />\nparticularly apparent in Hopkins'<br />\nlast three games, when they<br />\ngrabbed 67, 65, and 65 caroms<br />\nrespectively. This combination of<br />\nstrong shooting and control of<br />\nthe backboards at both ends of<br />\nthe court proved too much for<br />\nthe opposition throughout the<br />\nseason.<br />\nAnother important factor in<br />\nthe squad's success was the<br />\nstrong bench that gave Coach<br />\nLoveland the depth required to<br />\nregularly use an effective full<br />\ncourt press without overtaxing<br />\nhis players.<br />\nAfter adjusting to the team's<br />\ncapabilities, Loveland instituted a<br />\nflexible substitution system that<br />\n<br />\nallowed each player to<br />\naggressively play all out while on<br />\nthe court, which is important to<br />\na running team like Hopkins.<br />\nQuarterbacking<br />\nQuarterbacking the squad was<br />\nguard Paul Spence, who led the<br />\nteam in scoring with a 17.8 point<br />\naverage, hitting 55% of his<br />\nattempted shots and scoring on<br />\n50 free throws. More indicative<br />\nof his leadership ability was his<br />\nrole as the team's playmaker,<br />\nevidenced by the fact that he had<br />\n60 assists over the season, which<br />\nwas twelve more than the next<br />\nhighest figure.<br />\nGreg DeLong was another key<br />\nto the Baby Jay season. His 93<br />\n<br />\nfield goals was a high for the<br />\nteam, and his rebounding was<br />\nalso exceptional. DeLong picked<br />\noff an average of 10 stray shots a<br />\ngame from his forward position.<br />\nOther important cogs in the<br />\nboard clearing machine were<br />\ncenter John Sauter and Forward<br />\nTom Davis, who combined to<br />\ngrab 203 rebounds.<br />\nDefense was another strength<br />\nof the freshmen. As a unit, the<br />\nBaby Jays presented each<br />\nopponent with any one of several<br />\ndefenses. Coach Loveland<br />\nworked primarily with a tight<br />\n<br />\n10301 zone and an oppressive<br />\nman-to-man that defused many<br />\nattacks.

Brown, who<br />\nbecame director of the project<br />\nwhen O'Connor left Hopkins<br />\nrecently, denies the<br />\nNews-American account.<br />\nLack of Facilities<br />\n\"More than anything else, it<br />\nwas the lack of facilities which<br />\nkilled Project Exit,\" said Brown.<br />\nAlthough Foster agreed that<br />\nExit's greatest disadvantage while<br />\nin operation was a lack of<br />\nfacilities, she holds that<br />\n\"politics\" dealt the program its<br />\ndeathblow, and that Project<br />\nExit's potential benefits lost a<br />\n<br />\nbattle with East Baltimore's<br />\nvested interests.<br />\nFoster maintained that<br />\nessentially irrelevant incidents<br />\ncontributed to Hopkins' closing<br />\nof the rehabilitation center.<br />\n\"While we were fighting to get<br />\nmaterials to keep the center<br />\nopen, there was a lot of tension<br />\nboth in the patients and in the<br />\nstaff....One of the residents shot<br />\na hole through the floor...one of<br />\nthe staff pulled a knife on<br />\nanother staff member..there was<br />\nan incident involving a<br />\nhomosexual resident.\" Brown<br />\ndenied that any of these<br />\nincidents influenced the<br />\nHospital's decision to terminate<br />\nthe Exit center.<br />\nAbstinence<br />\nProject Exit was the first<br />\nresident drug rehabilitation<br />\ncenter in East Baltimore, and also<br />\nthe first to work toward total<br />\nwithdrawal. Methadone, Foster<br />\npointed out, is even more<br />\niddicting than heroin; Project<br />\nExit's philosophy encourages<br />\ntotal abstinence from all drugs<br />\nand alchohol.<br />\nThe project was of special<br />\nsignificance since its Hopkins<br />\nbacking, among other factors,<br />\nmade it possible for drug<br />\noffenders to be paroled to the<br />\nproject. At the time of the<br />\nproject's termination, several<br />\nparolees were living at the center;<br />\nthey may have to return to jail.<br />\n<br />\nTHE OFFICE OF THE CHAPLAIN<br />\npresents<br />\n<br />\nAudrey Epps Phillips<br />\nRenowned Gospel Artist<br />\n<br />\nMary Carter Smith<br />\nActress, Poet<br />\n<br />\nFoster described herself as<br />\nbewildered by the fact that the<br />\nprogram was closed even though<br />\nthere were ample funds .to<br />\ncontinue it until the end of June.<br />\nDidn't Work<br />\n\"The major reason for closing<br />\ndown the center was simply that<br />\nit didn't work,\" said Brown. He<br />\ncited Hopkins' administrative<br />\nfigures showing that of over 100<br />\nentrants to the program, only six<br />\ncompleted the full tour at Project<br />\nExit, and that of those six,<br />\nprobably half are back on drugs.<br />\n\"Although I have nothing but<br />\nrespect and admiration for Freda<br />\n(Foster), Brown said, \"the fact<br />\nremains that because of the<br />\ncircumstances \u2014 the problems<br />\nwith buildings and facilities \u2014 the<br />\nprogram was not effective.\"<br />\nAccording to Foster, only<br />\nabout one-third of Brown's<br />\nhundred entrants ever appeared<br />\nat Project Exit's residences, and<br />\nof those, many left too quickly<br />\nto have recieved any meaningful<br />\ntreatment. \"Most of our time,<br />\nboth the patients' and the staffs<br />\nwent to menial labor \u2014 trying to<br />\nmake these buildings fit to live<br />\nin. There wasn't the time or<br />\nenergy to work on the goals of<br />\nthe program.\"<br />\nMovin' On<br />\nAt the time of its termination,<br />\nProject Exit was in its third<br />\nhome, a rowhouse in the 800<br />\nblock of North Broadway. Two<br />\n<br />\nother buildings were left because<br />\nof their dilapidated condition',<br />\nand, according to Brown, some<br />\nneighborhood resistance. \"We<br />\nspent an incredible amount of<br />\ntime hustling furniture and<br />\nequipment,\" said Foster. She<br />\nclaims that the assistance<br />\nprovided by Hopkins was<br />\nabsolutely minimal, sufficing<br />\nonly for salaries and food.<br />\nAs of last week, Hopkins<br />\nHospital had laid claim to the<br />\nExit house's furnishings and<br />\nequipment, which were privately<br />\ndonated to Project Exit through<br />\nthe efforts of Foster and the<br />\nstaff. The remaining funding for<br />\nthe project is slated for a drug<br />\nrehabilitation project which will<br />\n<br />\nbe sponsored by the East<br />\nBaltimore Community<br />\nCorporation. A second existing<br />\nEast Baltimore rehabilitation<br />\nproject, Xcell, has access to the<br />\nhouse itself.<br />\nThere are presently no plans<br />\nfor another Hopkins Hospital<br />\ndrug rehabilitation residence,<br />\nalthough Dr. Brown says that he<br />\nis willing to support a second<br />\neffort. \"If someone came in<br />\ntomorrow and said, 'Would you<br />\nlike a house for forty people?'<br />\nwe'd jump at the chance.<br />\nEveryone is terriblY<br />\ndisappointed; everyone had an<br />\nenormous amount of time and<br />\neffort in the project.\"<br />\n<br />\nWOMEN<br />\n<br />\n1.

That magazine,<br />\nwhich folded after its first issue,<br />\nincurred a $1000 budget deficit<br />\nand was a combination of<br />\nliterature, university affairs, and<br />\ntechnical matters.<br />\nWithout any advertisements,<br />\nthis year's Charles Street Journal<br />\nhopes to depend exclusively on<br />\nliterary and artistic contributions<br />\nfrom Hopkins undergraduates,<br /><br />\ngraduate students, and faculty.<br />\n\"We're not planning a big, fancy<br />\nmagazine like that,\" stated Jed<br />\nFahey, one of the four<br />\norganizers, \"just a good quality<br />\none.\"<br />\nThe four freshman organizers,<br />\nFahey, Philip Burlington, Randy<br />\nGerlinger, and John Shapiro, had<br />\ndecided to call the magazine<br />\nBalance, but later changed the<br />\nname to Charles Street Journal.<br />\nFahey maintained that the group<br />\nwould not have . received any<br />\nfunding from James Sydnor,<br />\nDirector of Student Activities,<br />\nhad they not retained the name<br />\nof the now defunct journal.

The<br />\nidea seems to be a good one, filling a large void on the<br />\ncampus. There are few activities at Hopkins that<br />\nappeal to all segments of the University community,<br />\nand, indeed, the absence of such popular functions<br />\ncontributes to the lack of that community. The Spring<br />\nFestival, as it is currently formulated, seems designed<br />\nto attract as wide an audience as possible. It would<br />\nundoubtedly be a pleasant diversion for the upcoming<br />\nwarm weather, one that could be enjoyed by all<br />\nsegments of the University.<br />\nIn its place, dissident Council members want to put<br />\na concert, and plan a Big Spring Weekend. The<br />\nconcert, with its Aquarian age popularity, would<br />\nappeal to one segment of the community, while the<br />\nLacrosse game and dance and such would attract its<br />\nusual fraternity fans. There seems to be reason to<br />\nreplace the Spring Festival with events of such limited<br />\nappeal.<br />\nThis lack of valid justification for the move was<br />\nreflected in the manner in the actions of the Council.<br />\nVoting one way then another, the Council apparently<br />\nmisunderstood their own proposals. The proposed<br />\ncensure of President Bates seems totally absurd.<br />\nHopefully the SC will regain some sort of_ bearings<br />\nnext Monday and reinstitute the Spring Festival.<br /><br />\nNEWS'<br />\neditors-in-chief<br />\nbusiness managers<br />\nexecutive editor<br />\nday editors<br />\nmanaging editors<br />\nadvertising manager<br />\nsports editor<br />\nphotography editors<br />\nfeatures editor<br /><br />\nbrp<br /><br />\nMichael Hill, Art Levine<br />\nHarry Keyserling, Nick IVillick<br />\nStephen Tulloss<br />\nDon Lassus, Michael Weissman<br />\nRichard Waring, Howard Weaver<br />\nMark Warns<br />\nMark Leifer<br />\nJeff Forman, Martin Reber<br />\nDaniel Epstein<br /><br />\nstaff writers:<br />\nBill Abbott, Richard ' Bland, Richard Gurlitz, Brent<br />\nMcLaughlin, Sue Woolhiser<br />\nreporters:<br />\nWarren Gulin, Howard Simons, Gary Soulsman, Linda Sharp,<br />\nBruce Stevenson, Bill Witting<br />\nstaff:<br />\nMichael Berke, Richard Burkhardt, Joe Cantor, Jay Conaty,<br />\nNancy Forgione, Mike Granet, Lyle Gulley, John Hament,<br />\nBruce Jackson, Bob Kravis, Kathy McKay, Anne Mountcastle,<br />\nElsa Newman, Robert Paulus, Robert Ruby, Lisa Schwender,<br />\nAlvin Stein, Allen Yarns, Saul Zalesch<br />\nthe news-letter is published twice each week during the school year by<br />\nthe students of the johns hopkins university, homewood campus,<br />\nbaltimpre, maryland. editorial and business correspondence should be<br />\naddressed to box 1230, the johns hopkins university, baltimore,<br />\nmaryland, 21 21 8; telephone 301-366-3300, extension 1308.<br />\nsubscriptions $8 per annum, member, columbia scholastic press<br />\nassociation.<br /><br />\n\"How'd This One Get In Here?<br /><br />\nThe Blue Ribbon Panel has done its job and done it<br />\nwell. It is rare that one gets the pleasure of saying that<br />\nabout a committee at Hopkins, but despite precarious<br />\nprophecies, the BRP has merited such praise. In the<br />\nacademic area, it has recognized that, above all, better<br />\nteaching is needed. If Hopkins' professors begin to<br />\ndevote their time and academic energies to teaching<br />\nundergraduates, then the courses that undergraduates<br />\nneed for a liberal arts education will follow. Even<br />\nwithin the structure of the traditional program,<br />\nsignificantly improved teaching would right a great<br />\ndeal of the current wrong. It is also refreshing that the<br />\nBRP has been brave enough to call for the inclusion of<br />\nstudents in the evaluation of teaching.<br />\n, -A pleasant surprise was the inclusion of<br />\nrecommendations for changes in the non-academic<br />\nareas of the undergraduate's life. Apparently swayed<br />\nby the strong response it recieved from its poll, the<br />\nBRP made this topic a major subject of its report.<br />\nHere, too, its recommendation for the Dean of<br />\nStudents is worthy of praise. But more importantly, it<br />\nis significant that the BRP recognized and pointed out<br />\nto the Academic Council many of the concerns of the<br />\nundergraduates in this area. \"The faculty and<br />\nadministration must realize that undergraduates are<br />\nnot graduate students in disguise\" to quote the report.<br />\nAfter this one pleasant surprise, it would be very<br />\nnice to have another \u2014 quick action by the Academic<br />\nCouncil to implement the recommendations.<br /><br />\n'lle-Eleet Nixon'!\"<br /><br />\n\u2022.c:Fz .<br />\nt<br /><br />\n4,comtvr<br />\nLov.$ foST\u2022pitfilVoi<br /><br />\n(Herblock i.s on vacation)<br /><br />\nOpinion<br /><br />\nTermpapers<br />\nThe inaction of those organizations<br />\nand persons responsible for protecting<br />\nthe academic and moral integrity of The<br />\nJohns Hopkins University and its<br />\ncommunity was the spark which<br />\nmotivated us to take on the drive to<br />\nuphold the interests of this institution.<br />\nHad all persons officially entrusted with<br />\nthis obligation acted responsibly and used<br />\nall means in their jurisdiction and power<br />\nto eliminate the fraudulent use of term<br />\npapers at Hopkins, we ourselves would<br />\nnot have been compelled to take on this<br />\n,task. Since they did not act, we felt it<br />\nwas necessary for us to speak out and<br />\nassume the responsibility which had been<br />\nabdicated by default.<br />\nWe heartily commend the Honor<br />\nCommission for now having taken the<br />\nproper stand against the plagiaristic use<br />\nof commercially written term papers.<br />\n, However, the News-Letter continues to<br />\naid the use of commercial term paper<br />\n'writing services by running their<br />\naclvectisements.

Kubrick tries to<br />\njustify the violence in the movie by<br />\nrelegating it to \"the sense of the times.\"<br />\nThe setting is a visualization of the<br />\nfuture, like Kubrick's past works, \"Dr.<br />\nStrangelove\" and \"2001.\" In \"Orange,\"<br />\nhowever, he chooses to film a society<br />\nwhich is repulsively real, one which<br />\ncannot be put out of one's mind as easily<br />\nas in other movies.<br />\nKubrick's treatment of the<br />\nscience-fiction novel upon which this<br />\nmovie is based can be seen as overkill or<br />\nas mastery of the screen's power; his<br />\nexcessive use of classical music, often at a<br />\ndeafening pitch, is a factor which<br /><br />\ngave Coleman's audience an opportunity<br />\nto hear how an author intends his<br />\nunconventional expressions to be<br />\ninunciated: \"Plunk!/Shock to the<br />\nstomach./Plunk! Plunk!/Shock to the<br />\nheart.\" Several people commented<br />\nafterwards that the shocks could be felt<br />\nas he read. The types of connections<br />\nbetween the words seemed to be as<br />\nimportant as the words themselves.<br />\n\"Proses out of the Deep\" and \"Proses<br />\nout of the Blue\" which followed were<br />\nmore personal compositions. After a<br />\npause and adjustment of his glasses,<br />\nColeman spoke about the \"fearful and<br />\ndelicious sense that someone we do not<br />\nknow is suffering\" as he gave a spirited<br />\nand entertaining reading of \"Sirens.\"<br />\nHe held up his typed copy of \"White<br />\nCoral\" before he read it to point out that<br />\nit was structured much like coral.

The<br />\npolitics are very similar, the dress and<br />\nenvironment just different enough to<br />\nmake it seem far-away, and the<br />\n\"ultraviolence\" is timeless sadism, rape,<br />\nassault and murder, thrown at you<br />\ngraphically and constantly.<br />\nMalcolm McDowell's performance as<br />\nAlex, the leader of the quartet of thugs,<br />\nis done with smashing arrogance. His<br />\naffinity for foraying out to the country<br />\nwith his gang and brutalizing the<br />\noccupants of beautiful houses is<br />\npsychologically unequalled in other films.<br /><br />\nHis dominance of the rest of his gang,<br />\nmostly by physical means, is convincing.<br /><br />\n'Feminist' theatre draws heated feminist objection<br />\nBy KATHY CAMPBELL<br />\n\"You can be wife, slut, whore, slave.<br />\nThink it over twice. The man with the<br />\nwhip knows best.\"<br />\n(from The Authority Song, lyrics by<br />\nArthur Morey, music by Bobby Paul).<br />\nThe New Feminist Theater<br />\nperformance at Towson State College on<br />\nFriday night was an unexciting, if<br />\nartistically adequate selection of songs<br />\nand patter until, as the troupe took their<br />\nbows, four women from the audience<br />\nwalked onto the stage protesting that the<br />\nshow was a \"sexist rip-off.\"<br />\nMolly Head, a student at Antioch<br />\ncollege and one of the women who<br />\nconfronted the performers, said that she<br />\nobjected to the group's describing itself<br />\nas \"feminist\", though two of the !bur<br />\nperformers were men and all the songs<br />\nwere written by the men. She said, \"I<br />\nresent the fact that everything was<br />\nwritten by men about women's feelings.<br />\nWe know what we feel; we don't need to<br />\nbe told.\"<br />\nThe four performers, Anselma<br />\ndell'Olio, Lady Walquer, Arthur Morey<br />\nand Bobby Paul, remained onstage to<br />\nanswer the women and others in the<br /><br />\naudience. They also heard some men and<br />\nwomen in the audience react favorably to<br />\ntheir performance.<br />\nAudience Divided<br />\nIn describing the way the show is put<br />\ntogether, dell'Olio said, \"we work<br />\ncollaboratively and collectively.\" Arthur<br />\nMorey, describing the same process, said,<br />\n\"Anselma tells me what's going on, I go<br />\nand write the lyrics and Bobby writes the<br />\nmusic.\" dell'Olio said that she had<br />\napproached several women songwriters,<br />\nbut that none were interested in working<br />\nwith her in women's theater.<br />\nThe audience seemed evenly divided<br />\nbetween those who objected to the<br />\nperformance and those who approved or<br />\n'who didn't care. One man got up to say<br />\nthat for a theater group to be criticized<br />\nfor the politics of their performance,\"for<br />\nsomeone to tell them what they should<br />\ndo onstage, seems like fascism to me.\"<br />\nSeveral women arose to say that they<br />\nhad expected something quite different, a<br />\nperformance by a feminist theater group,<br />\nand that they were angry at the<br />\ndeception. Several on them were<br />\napplauded by a substantial minority of<br />\nthe audience.<br /><br />\nThe performance and ensuing<br />\ndiscussion were videotaped by a group of<br />\nAntioch students. One of the crew<br />\nworking in the project said she didn't<br />\nthink the performance was even worth<br />\narguing over.<br />\nA number of women seemed to feel<br />\nthat the issue was not political or artistic<br />\nbut commercial: deceptive packaging and<br />\ndeceptive advertising. One woman said<br />\nthat she had seen a flyer saying that the<br />\ngroup's appearance was sponsored by a<br />\nWoman's Liberation group, and that she<br />\nhad come for that reason, to see a<br />\nwomen's movement show. Another<br />\nwoman said that she had bought a $3.00<br />\nregular ticket, instead of the $2.00<br />\nstudent ticket because she thought the<br />\nmoney was going to a women's<br />\nmovement group. She said she was going<br />\nto demand her money back.<br />\nMany of the women in the audience<br />\nwere with other women, either in pairs or<br />\ngroups. Several objected to put-downs of<br />\nlesbians.<br />\nIn the song \"Hilda\", about a<br />\nprostitute, her slide into the lower depths<br />\nis described: \"First she had a husband,<br /><br />\nthen there was a pusher, then there were<br />\ndozens, and now she loves a woman. She<br />\ndoesn't know how she got there and she<br />\nhates every moment.\"<br />\nThis seemed to some women to<br />\nassociate woman-to-woman love with<br />\ndrug addiction and other degradations.<br />\nThey challanged this idea.<br />\nDell'Olio replied that she was only<br />\nrepresenting reality, that many<br />\nprostitutes were in fact, lesbians. She<br />\nadded,\"Women turn to other women out<br />\nof desperation\". Several women in the<br />\naudience groaned or hissed.<br />\n'No Chocolate Chippy'<br />\nMany of the songs portrayed women as<br />\nmasochists, playing the role of<br />\nlong-suffering martyrs but putting up<br />\nwith it.<br />\nOne song, \"Penelope\", describes a<br />\nwoman's day after her husband leaves in<br />\nthe morning and before he comes home<br />\nat night. She sits and spins monotonously<br />\nall day. Of herself she says, \"I'm a<br />\nfaithful wife, it's a hateful life.\"<br />\nOther songs describe the carefree,<br />\nheartless, peccadiloes of men.<br />\n\"Billy Yank\" impregnates his woman<br />\nand then puts to sea: \"That's the way of<br /><br />\naccustomed to hearing his voice through<br />\na microphone, and Coleman appeared to<br />\nenjoy his reading as much as his listeners.<br />\nThe last composition was a sestina, a<br />\ncomplex Italian verse form, framed by a<br />\none-stanza hymn and a closing lyric. He<br />\nmodestly apologized beforehand, saying<br />\nthat although he had never really wanted<br />\nto write a sestina, the fact that some of<br />\nhis undergraduate students were turning<br />\nthem in meant that he felt he should at<br />\nleast try. But no one seemed at all<br />\ndisappointed with the content or reading<br />\nof \"Requiem.\" A copy of it can be found<br />\nwith the exhibit of photographs now in<br />\nthe upper level of the library.<br />\nThe introduction given to Coleman by<br />\nSherry Gill, head of the Wednesday Noon<br />\nSeries, seemed even more appropriate as<br />\nthe applause ended: \"He writes<br />\nmarvelous poetry and is gentle and<br />\nempathic.\"<br /><br />\na Boston girl; down they go and up they<br />\nswell.\"<br />\n\"Black Xantippe\" is described by her<br />\nlover, a bemused whitey dipping his pen<br />\ntentatively in black ink: \"Oh, my black<br />\nXantippe, she's no chocolate chippy\"<br />\nRip-off<br />\nIn the \"Duet for Wife and Mistress\",<br />\nthe women trade anecdotes about the<br />\nfaithlessness of their men; \"Some he<br />\nloves for minds and hearts, some he loves<br />\nfor other parts\".

The Baby Jays<br />\nnetted 45% of their shots from<br />\nthe floor and pulled down an<br />\naverage of 51 rebounds a game.<br /><br />\nThe rebounding strength was<br />\nparticularly apparent in Hopkins'<br />\nlast three games, when they<br />\ngrabbed 67, 65, and 65 caroms<br />\nrespectively. This combination of<br />\nstrong shooting and control of<br />\nthe backboards at both ends of<br />\nthe court proved too much for<br />\nthe opposition throughout the<br />\nseason.<br />\nAnother important factor in<br />\nthe squad's success was the<br />\nstrong bench that gave Coach<br />\nLoveland the depth required to<br />\nregularly use an effective full<br />\ncourt press without overtaxing<br />\nhis players.<br />\nAfter adjusting to the team's<br />\ncapabilities, Loveland instituted a<br />\nflexible substitution system that<br /><br />\nallowed each player to<br />\naggressively play all out while on<br />\nthe court, which is important to<br />\na running team like Hopkins.<br />\nQuarterbacking<br />\nQuarterbacking the squad was<br />\nguard Paul Spence, who led the<br />\nteam in scoring with a 17.8 point<br />\naverage, hitting 55% of his<br />\nattempted shots and scoring on<br />\n50 free throws. More indicative<br />\nof his leadership ability was his<br />\nrole as the team's playmaker,<br />\nevidenced by the fact that he had<br />\n60 assists over the season, which<br />\nwas twelve more than the next<br />\nhighest figure.<br />\nGreg DeLong was another key<br />\nto the Baby Jay season. His 93<br /><br />\nfield goals was a high for the<br />\nteam, and his rebounding was<br />\nalso exceptional. DeLong picked<br />\noff an average of 10 stray shots a<br />\ngame from his forward position.<br />\nOther important cogs in the<br />\nboard clearing machine were<br />\ncenter John Sauter and Forward<br />\nTom Davis, who combined to<br />\ngrab 203 rebounds.<br />\nDefense was another strength<br />\nof the freshmen. As a unit, the<br />\nBaby Jays presented each<br />\nopponent with any one of several<br />\ndefenses. Coach Loveland<br />\nworked primarily with a tight<br /><br />\n10301 zone and an oppressive<br />\nman-to-man that defused many<br />\nattacks. Shifting frequently<br />\nbetween these two, the full court<br />\npress, and other defensive<br />\nvariations, Loveland befuddled<br />\nmany of the Blue Jays<br />\nadversaries.<br /><br />\nEach jock, T-shirt, towel and<br />\nsock used at the Newton H.<br />\nWhite Athletic Center is washed<br />\nmore than 1 25 times each<br />\nacademic year.<br /><br />\nwith<br />\nAudrey Hepburn<br /><br />\n,SCREAM<br /><br />\nWAIT UNTIL DARK<br /><br />\nsports briefs<br /><br />\nPLUS<br />\nBIA Swimming Tournament<br />\nThe annual BlA swimming<br />\ntournament will be held on<br />\nFriday, March 10 at 6:30 pm in<br />\nthe Newton H.

Brown, who<br />\nbecame director of the project<br />\nwhen O'Connor left Hopkins<br />\nrecently, denies the<br />\nNews-American account.<br />\nLack of Facilities<br />\n\"More than anything else, it<br />\nwas the lack of facilities which<br />\nkilled Project Exit,\" said Brown.<br />\nAlthough Foster agreed that<br />\nExit's greatest disadvantage while<br />\nin operation was a lack of<br />\nfacilities, she holds that<br />\n\"politics\" dealt the program its<br />\ndeathblow, and that Project<br />\nExit's potential benefits lost a<br /><br />\nbattle with East Baltimore's<br />\nvested interests.<br />\nFoster maintained that<br />\nessentially irrelevant incidents<br />\ncontributed to Hopkins' closing<br />\nof the rehabilitation center.<br />\n\"While we were fighting to get<br />\nmaterials to keep the center<br />\nopen, there was a lot of tension<br />\nboth in the patients and in the<br />\nstaff....One of the residents shot<br />\na hole through the floor...one of<br />\nthe staff pulled a knife on<br />\nanother staff member..there was<br />\nan incident involving a<br />\nhomosexual resident.\" Brown<br />\ndenied that any of these<br />\nincidents influenced the<br />\nHospital's decision to terminate<br />\nthe Exit center.<br />\nAbstinence<br />\nProject Exit was the first<br />\nresident drug rehabilitation<br />\ncenter in East Baltimore, and also<br />\nthe first to work toward total<br />\nwithdrawal. Methadone, Foster<br />\npointed out, is even more<br />\niddicting than heroin; Project<br />\nExit's philosophy encourages<br />\ntotal abstinence from all drugs<br />\nand alchohol.<br />\nThe project was of special<br />\nsignificance since its Hopkins<br />\nbacking, among other factors,<br />\nmade it possible for drug<br />\noffenders to be paroled to the<br />\nproject. At the time of the<br />\nproject's termination, several<br />\nparolees were living at the center;<br />\nthey may have to return to jail.<br /><br />\nTHE OFFICE OF THE CHAPLAIN<br />\npresents<br /><br />\nAudrey Epps Phillips<br />\nRenowned Gospel Artist<br /><br />\nMary Carter Smith<br />\nActress, Poet<br /><br />\nFoster described herself as<br />\nbewildered by the fact that the<br />\nprogram was closed even though<br />\nthere were ample funds .to<br />\ncontinue it until the end of June.<br />\nDidn't Work<br />\n\"The major reason for closing<br />\ndown the center was simply that<br />\nit didn't work,\" said Brown. He<br />\ncited Hopkins' administrative<br />\nfigures showing that of over 100<br />\nentrants to the program, only six<br />\ncompleted the full tour at Project<br />\nExit, and that of those six,<br />\nprobably half are back on drugs.<br />\n\"Although I have nothing but<br />\nrespect and admiration for Freda<br />\n(Foster), Brown said, \"the fact<br />\nremains that because of the<br />\ncircumstances \u2014 the problems<br />\nwith buildings and facilities \u2014 the<br />\nprogram was not effective.\"<br />\nAccording to Foster, only<br />\nabout one-third of Brown's<br />\nhundred entrants ever appeared<br />\nat Project Exit's residences, and<br />\nof those, many left too quickly<br />\nto have recieved any meaningful<br />\ntreatment. \"Most of our time,<br />\nboth the patients' and the staffs<br />\nwent to menial labor \u2014 trying to<br />\nmake these buildings fit to live<br />\nin. There wasn't the time or<br />\nenergy to work on the goals of<br />\nthe program.\"<br />\nMovin' On<br />\nAt the time of its termination,<br />\nProject Exit was in its third<br />\nhome, a rowhouse in the 800<br />\nblock of North Broadway. Two<br /><br />\nother buildings were left because<br />\nof their dilapidated condition',<br />\nand, according to Brown, some<br />\nneighborhood resistance. \"We<br />\nspent an incredible amount of<br />\ntime hustling furniture and<br />\nequipment,\" said Foster. She<br />\nclaims that the assistance<br />\nprovided by Hopkins was<br />\nabsolutely minimal, sufficing<br />\nonly for salaries and food.<br />\nAs of last week, Hopkins<br />\nHospital had laid claim to the<br />\nExit house's furnishings and<br />\nequipment, which were privately<br />\ndonated to Project Exit through<br />\nthe efforts of Foster and the<br />\nstaff. The remaining funding for<br />\nthe project is slated for a drug<br />\nrehabilitation project which will<br /><br />\nbe sponsored by the East<br />\nBaltimore Community<br />\nCorporation. A second existing<br />\nEast Baltimore rehabilitation<br />\nproject, Xcell, has access to the<br />\nhouse itself.<br />\nThere are presently no plans<br />\nfor another Hopkins Hospital<br />\ndrug rehabilitation residence,<br />\nalthough Dr. Brown says that he<br />\nis willing to support a second<br />\neffort. \"If someone came in<br />\ntomorrow and said, 'Would you<br />\nlike a house for forty people?'<br />\nwe'd jump at the chance.<br />\nEveryone is terriblY<br />\ndisappointed; everyone had an<br />\nenormous amount of time and<br />\neffort in the project.\"<br /><br />\nWOMEN<br /><br />\n1.
