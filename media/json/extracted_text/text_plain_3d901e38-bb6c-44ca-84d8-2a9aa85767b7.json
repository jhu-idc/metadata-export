Lack of student enthusiasm for, and involvement in, student government efforts is often blamed for<br />\nits failures.<br />\nParadoxically, apathetic candidates are now running for office, claiming that their unconcern is representative of student attitudes. Eric Fink led the<br />\nGASP (Generally Apathetic<br />\nStudents Party) in the Hopkins<br />\nStudent Council elections last<br />\nyear. Similar parties have<br />\nsprung up at many universities.<br />\nThe University of Utah held<br />\nelections recently for its legislative assembly. Two parties<br />\nwith platforms of apathy offered candidates\u2014the Burial<br />\nParty, which ran on the platform of reducing the budget<br />\navailable for student activities,<br />\nand the KOBOL (Krush Apathetic Bureaucracy) Party,<br />\nwhich ran on a platform of<br />\nabolishing parts of student<br />\ngovernment altogether.<br />\nEvidently, students in many<br />\ncollege campuses don't think<br />\nthat their student representatives are doing much to<br />\njustify their existence.<br />\nBut it's a mistake to conclude<br />\nthat students are necessarily<br />\nand irrevocably disinterested in<br />\n/what the Student Council is doing. There are a lot of things<br />\nstudents definitely do give a<br />\ndamn about. Some examples\u2014<br />\ntheir grades, the state of their<br />\nfinances and their night life.<br />\nWhen student government<br />\nbegins to have an impact in<br />\nareas close to students, those<br />\nstudents will care about what<br />\nstudent government is doing.<br />\nThis is what the Johns<br />\nHopkins Student Council will<br />\nattempt over the coming year.<br />\nWe.will attack first the questions which relate directly to a<br />\nlarge number of students. We<br />\nwant to make changes which<br />\nwill have an immediate impact<br />\nand which will have that impact<br />\nin the near future.<br />\nThis does not mean we have<br />\nto be short-sighted. It means<br />\nthat we have to focus our<br />\npriorities in a rational and efficient manner.<br />\nThis philosphy will guide us*<br />\nin setting the agenda for Student Council and its committees in the coming year.<br />\nThe Housing Committee will<br />\n<br />\nbe led by Steve Segreto, who<br />\nwas at the forefront of the<br />\nMcCoy rents controversy last<br />\nyear. As a result of Steve's efforts, along with those of other<br />\nmembers of last year's Housing<br />\nCommittee, McCoy rents paid<br />\nby many freshmen were<br />\nlowered.<br />\nJon Lana will lead the Committee on Education.

The presentation<br />\nis a joint effort by Ted<br />\nWrigley, the J.H.U. Orientation Committee, and the Barnstormers. Due to a shortage of<br />\nsummer Hopkins students,<br />\nWrigley's open auditions drew<br />\noutside talent. Only one of the<br />\nfour actors is a student, and<br />\nKathryn Ranniger Smith, who<br />\nplays Amanda Wingfield,<br />\nWilliams' class-conscious<br />\nsouthern-belle-past-her-prime,<br />\nis a woman in her early forties.<br />\nPerhaps this is why the play<br />\nworks so well. The mind does<br />\nnot have to attempt a conversion of age as in most student<br />\nproductions, and instead can<br />\nconcentrate on the show at<br />\nhand.<br />\nThe Glass Menagerie is a<br />\nproduction. Prosolid<br />\nducer/director Ted Wrigley, a<br />\nsenior at Hopkins, seems to<br />\nhave given his actors a fairly<br />\nfree reign over their parts, and<br />\nhe evokes smooth perforA<br />\nall.<br />\nfrom<br />\nmances<br />\ncamaraderie is established between the actors, and the intimacy of the Barn Theater<br />\n(and also the fact that there<br />\nwere a mere 20 people in the audience last Sunday night) lends<br />\nitself to a comfortable<br />\natmosphere\u2014as if we were<br />\npeeping through an apartment<br />\nwindow rather than observing<br />\na public performance.<br />\nSmith delivers perhaps the<br />\nmost skilled performance of the<br />\nfour actors. Her characterization of Amanda Wingfield, a<br />\nfunny, foolish, rather frantic<br />\nwoman, is never overdone.<br />\nWhile it would be easy to create<br />\na caricature of Amanda, Smith<br />\ntakes her from the nagging of<br />\nan all-too-recognizable mother<br />\nto the bragging repetitiveness of<br />\nan old woman's memories to<br />\nthe anger of a mother hurt by<br />\nher son, and yet never crosses<br />\nthat line. Smith's age is also a<br />\nfactor in her credibility. It<br />\nwould be difficult to imagine a<br />\nyounger actress attempting to<br />\nportray the mother of two<br />\nchildren in their twenties.<br />\nJimi Cohee as Tom is a<br />\nhighly believable angry young<br />\nman. The aspiring poet who<br />\nworks by day in a shoe<br />\nwarehouse and \"goes to the<br />\nmovies\" at night is a tragic example of stifled creativity.<br />\n\"People go to the movies instead of moving,\" he laments.<br />\nTom wants adventure and plans<br />\nto find it. \"I'm tired of the<br />\nmovies, he says, \"and I am<br />\nabout to move!\"<br />\nCalled \"Shakespeare\" by his<br />\nfriend Jim, Tom is our Greek<br />\nchorus, our giver of \"truth in<br />\nthe pleasant disguise of illusion.\" Cohee's voice, however,<br />\nis at times pretentious and<br />\npeculiar in relation to the other<br />\ncharacters and the setting of St.<br />\n<br />\nKathryn Ranniger Smith as Amanda Wingfield and Jimi Cohee as Tom<br />\n<br />\nLouis. He also plays too heavily at times, expressing unsuppressed irony when it should be<br />\nbarely suppressed and controlling his voice when he should be<br />\ngoing all out. Cohee loosens up<br />\nand is perhaps best in Scene IV<br />\nas the drunken Tom\u2014unable to<br />\nget the proverbial key in the<br />\ndoor, slurring his speech just<br />\nso, a happy grin on his handsome face. From this point on,<br />\ncharacter and actor are<br />\nliberated. It is as if the earlier<br />\ntirade that prompted Tom's indiscretion freed both character<br />\nand actor to delve for a more<br />\npure expression of emotion.<br />\nFor an actress to play Laura<br />\nwell, it is necessary to be very<br />\nunobtrusive. Laura is painfully shy, a girl who gets \"nervous<br />\nindigestion\" (she throws up)<br />\nfrom taking courses at a<br />\nbusiness college, and thus<br />\nquits, and a girl whose fragile<br />\nlife revolves around the fragile<br />\nfigurines of her glass<br />\nmenagerie. As Laura, Pippa<br />\nHailstone blends quietly into<br />\nbackgrounds and foregrounds<br />\nShe can be sitting on the floor<br />\nin front of an arguing Tom and<br />\nAmanda and go completely unnoticed until a lull in the \"conversation\" or a light movement<br />\non Hailstone's part draws our<br />\nsurprised attention to the pretty blonde with drawn eyebrows<br />\nand a prematurely wrinkled<br />\nforehead. Hailstone is excellent<br />\nin a part that gives little room<br />\nfor notice.<br />\nThe only weak part of the<br />\nshow is Toby Mordkoff as Jim<br />\nO'Connor, the gentleman<br />\ncaller. A special thanks is accorded in the program to Mordkoff \"for stepping in on short<br />\nnotice.\" Mordkott, a Hopkins<br />\nsophomore, while boisterous, is<br />\nnot quite up to par with the<br />\n<br />\nother actors. The rapport the<br />\nothers have seems to be<br />\nsomewhat less evident in<br />\ncharacterization, probably due<br />\nto lack of time to study the<br />\npart. Mordkoff, however, is a<br />\nvery likeable Jim, boyish and<br />\ncharming, though not without<br />\na bragging streak when confronted with Laura's obvious<br />\npunchy<br />\nHii<br />\nadulation.<br />\ncharacterization overrides his<br />\nword-stumbling and linedropping and delivers a fun, if<br />\nnot strong, performance.<br />\nBecause it is a \"memory<br />\nplay,\" Tennessee Williams considered the role of music in The<br />\nGlass Menagerie important. It<br />\nis Laura's music, and thus light<br />\nand rather sorrowful. Laura<br />\n<br />\nturns the music on to block out<br />\nwhat she does not want to<br />\nexperience\u2014reality. However,<br />\ninstead of the music weaving in<br />\nand out of our consciousness as<br />\nit was intended, it is more of a<br />\ndistraction.

Liza Klein said the<br />\norientation period \"helped everyone to loosen up.\"<br />\nKatie Uzlyn welcomed Orientation as a time to make<br />\nfriends and \"to get to know her roommate.\"<br />\nThen there were those freshmen who thought the<br />\norientation period was a bit awkward and full of artificial, forced friendships. One freshman commented<br />\nthat most of her conversations with other freshman<br />\nrevolved around the following questions: \"What's<br />\nyour name?,\" \"Where are you from?,\" \"Where are<br />\n<br />\nc<br />\n<br />\nit<br />\ncl<br />\n<br />\nV<br />\n<br />\nIi<br />\nis<br />\n<br />\n\fNEWS-LETTER/11<br />\nyou living?,\" \"What's your major?\" and \"What do<br />\nyou think of the guys?\"<br />\nIlene Rosenzweig felt Orientation was like \"camp\".<br />\n\"The whole goal of Orientation is to socialize.

They can't ruin that. I'm happy with<br />\nthe Golden Grahams.\" Jose Ivey doesn't mind leaving his parents but he may miss their cooking. Jose<br />\ndescribes ARA food as \"about the worst thing I've<br />\never tasted.\" Phil Manning and Katie Uzlyn don't<br />\nthink the food is that bad and describe it as \"edible\".<br />\nSome of the freshmen are homesick. Sherry Emery<br />\nfrom Colorado, Susie Stickley from Spain and George<br />\nTing from Hong Kong believe it will be difficult living so far away from home. Phil Manning says he was<br />\n\"definitely ready to leave.\" Katie Uzlyn likes the<br />\ndistance trom her parents because now she will have<br />\na chance to \"be on her own.\" Marika Hrehorovich<br />\nof Baltimore' is glad to be living close to home.<br />\n\"Elopkins is not known for its wild spots.

Entering the last week of<br />\nMiddle Atlantic Conference action with a 3-3 league record<br />\n(15-13 overall), Jays needed to<br />\nsweep their remaining four<br />\ngames to cabture a tie for first<br />\nplace in the MAC Southeast.<br />\nWith one loss ending all hope<br />\nof post-season action, the Blue<br />\nJay pitching staff came<br />\nthrough, hurling three shutouts. Against Haverford freshman Mark Campbell tossed a<br />\nfive-hitter in the opening game<br />\nof a doubleheader, while Dave<br />\nProvost threw a three-hitter in<br />\nthe nightcap.<br />\n<br />\nSeveral Blue Jays earned individual honors. Pitcher Steve<br />\nHand was named to the MAC<br />\nFirst Team All-Stars with a 7-3<br />\nrecord and a 1.60 ERA. First<br />\nbaseman/pitcher Mark Campbell was named to the MAC<br />\nSecond Team All-Stars with a<br />\n.266 batting average and a 1.57<br />\nERA on the hill.<br />\nBoth Hand and Campbell<br />\nwere among the nation's<br />\nleaders in Earned Run Average.<br />\nJunior Captain Andy Lachance<br />\nwas named to the MAC First<br />\nTeam All-Stars for the second<br />\nstraight year. Lachance batted<br />\na team high .330 with 17 RBI's<br />\nwhile playing a solid second<br />\nbase.<br />\n<br />\nCraig Brooks singles against Widener.<br />\n<br />\nThe following day the Blue<br />\nJays hosted the Ursinus College<br />\nBears in a crucial MAC twinbill. Senior Steve Hand fired<br />\nHopkins' third consecutive<br />\nshutout. Andy Lachance and<br />\nCraig Brooks were the hitting<br />\nstars in the Jays' 3-0 victory.<br />\nIn the second game freshman<br />\nGeoff Bender upped his record<br />\nto 2-3 with relief help from<br />\nMark Campbell in a thrilling<br />\n7-5 victory. The doubleheader<br />\nsweep gave Hopokins a tie for<br />\nfirst place in the MAC Southeast with Widener as both<br />\nteams ended with identical 7-3<br />\nrecords.<br />\nThe Jays traveled to Widener for a playot t game to decide<br />\nthe league championship.<br />\nHopkins broke a 1-1 tie in the<br />\ntop of the eighth inning on a<br />\nwalk to James Cardwell and<br />\nsingles by Scott Burns and<br />\nCraig Brooks.<br />\nEntering the bottom of the<br />\n9th, Hopkins held a 3-1 lead.<br />\nHowever,a walk, single and hit<br />\nbatsman loaded the bases for<br />\nWidener with one out. Coach<br />\nBob Babb brought in Steve<br />\nHand in an attempt to end the<br />\nthreat. Hand responded by<br />\nstriking out the first batter he<br />\nfaced. He then went one ball<br />\nand two strikes to Widener's<br />\nnext batter. One strike away<br />\nfrom a victory, the Jays were<br />\ndisappointed as the next pitch<br />\nwas lined to center. The ball<br />\nwas misplayed and all three<br />\nrunners crossed the plate, turning Hopkins 3-1 lead into a 4-3<br />\nloss. Coach Babb called lithe<br />\n\"toughest game I've ever been<br />\ninvolved with.\"<br />\nTwo games followed this<br />\nheartbreaker\u2014a 4-0 victory<br />\nover Gettysburgh and an 18-6<br />\nloss to Salisbury State. Dave<br />\nProvost pitched his second<br />\nstraight shutout against Gettysburgh raising his record to<br />\n5-2.<br />\nThe Jays' final record was<br />\n20-13. The thirty-three games<br />\nrepresent the most ever played<br />\nby a Blue Jay team, and the 20<br />\nwin mark was reached for only<br />\nthe third time in Blue Jay<br />\nhistory.

Grogan<br />\nAfter three (count 'em<br />\nthree) years at Hopkins, I<br />\ndecided last week that physically, I am unfit. The onefingered-page-flip, the Orgobook-tuck-and-carry and the<br />\nend-of-class-one-handeddesktop-toss are simply not<br />\nenough to keep one in condi-<br />\n<br />\ntion. Therefore, like a good student, I resolved to read up on<br />\nphysical fitness.<br />\nSeven volumes and 1623 onefingered-page-flips later I had a<br />\ngreat headache, but I was no<br />\ncloser to being fit. I decided to<br />\nconsult some experts. But who?<br />\nNaturally, those paragons of<br />\naerobic fitness\u2014the cross country team.<br />\n<br />\nAfter a quick search of<br />\nschool, I looked into a sleazy<br />\nbar and saw them\u2014nine skinny, beer-drinking guys who<br />\ncould never be mistaken for a<br />\nfootball squad. One tipped<br />\nback his beer, finished it, yelled \"Airborne\" and hurled it<br />\nagainst the wall: Another, who<br />\nlooked like a relic from Atilla's<br />\nhordes, called me over.<br />\n<br />\n\"Sit down. Whaddya<br />\nwant?\" I replied that I came in<br />\nsearch of fitness.<br />\n\"You've come to the wrong<br />\nplace. Cross country has<br />\nnothing to do with fitness.\"<br />\n\"Nothing?\" I asked.<br />\n\"Most of us have gotten hurt<br />\nrunning. That's not fitness.<br />\nYou want fitness?

This represents<br />\none of the largest turnouts in<br />\nthe team's six years. The only<br />\nsenior lost to_graduation was<br />\nKathy Connally. Though Connally was one of the squad's top<br />\nrunners, the addition of a<br />\nnumber of freshmen should<br />\nmore than make up for her loss.<br />\nThree freshmen, Angel Dean,<br />\nCissy King and Anne Marie<br />\nUlrick, were actively recruited<br />\nlast spring. Coach Gary Green<br />\nis excited about these freshmen<br />\nrunners. \"They have been<br />\ntremendous performers in high<br />\nschool and will significantly<br />\nadd to our team strength,\" said<br />\nGreen.<br />\nThis season the team will<br />\nbenefit from the addition of<br />\n<br />\nassistant coach Eleanor Simonsick. A '79 Hopkins graduate,<br />\nSimonsick is a world class runner who recently returned from<br />\nNorway, where she represented<br />\nthe United States in the World<br />\nTrack and Field Championships at the 10 kilometer<br />\ndistance. She will assist the<br />\nteam by making up workouts<br />\n<br />\nand giving advice. Other<br />\nchanges this season will include<br />\nincreased emphasis on weight<br />\ntraining, track workouts, stretching and participation in area<br />\nroad races.<br />\nAfter finishing seventh out of<br />\n15 MAC schools last year, the<br />\nteam hopes to win the conference championships this fall.<br />\n<br />\nThis season looks challenging<br />\nwith meets scheduled against<br />\nthe always strong Mary Washington, Gettysburg and Franklin and Marshall. The team's<br />\nfirst home meet will be the<br />\nMetro Invitational, Saturday,<br />\nSeptember 17 against neighboring schools UMBC and Towson<br />\nState.<br />\n<br />\nCoach Gary Green instructs his team.<br />\n<br />\nSteve Eisenberg<br />\n<br />\nI was confused. \"Then why<br />\nrun? The runner's high?\"<br />\n\"Kind of, the high of survival. You run a race, it's life<br />\nand death. Running is meeting<br />\nyour maker and getting another<br />\nchance to live. Running's not<br />\nfitness, it's religious, it's selfdiscovery.\"<br />\n\"But it's a team sport, too.\"<br />\n\"Yeah.\"<br />\n\"So how are you guys gonna do?\"<br />\n\"Well...our coach would<br />\nsay 'What's important is each<br />\nperson's fulfilling his own potential and to the extent that we do<br />\nthat, we will have success, not<br />\njust in a spiritual sense, but<br />\nmaterially as well, with victories<br />\nand prizes.' But that's a<br />\ncrock ... we run so we are successful. The only failure that<br />\nI've seen is that lot of myopic<br />\nD-level scum who sit on their<br />\nduffs and whine 'I can't...'<br />\nCross country isn't for<br />\neveryone, but, fit or not, there's<br />\nsomething for everyone!

Lack of student enthusiasm for, and involvement in, student government efforts is often blamed for<br />\nits failures.<br />\nParadoxically, apathetic candidates are now running for office, claiming that their unconcern is representative of student attitudes. Eric Fink led the<br />\nGASP (Generally Apathetic<br />\nStudents Party) in the Hopkins<br />\nStudent Council elections last<br />\nyear. Similar parties have<br />\nsprung up at many universities.<br />\nThe University of Utah held<br />\nelections recently for its legislative assembly. Two parties<br />\nwith platforms of apathy offered candidates\u2014the Burial<br />\nParty, which ran on the platform of reducing the budget<br />\navailable for student activities,<br />\nand the KOBOL (Krush Apathetic Bureaucracy) Party,<br />\nwhich ran on a platform of<br />\nabolishing parts of student<br />\ngovernment altogether.<br />\nEvidently, students in many<br />\ncollege campuses don't think<br />\nthat their student representatives are doing much to<br />\njustify their existence.<br />\nBut it's a mistake to conclude<br />\nthat students are necessarily<br />\nand irrevocably disinterested in<br />\n/what the Student Council is doing. There are a lot of things<br />\nstudents definitely do give a<br />\ndamn about. Some examples\u2014<br />\ntheir grades, the state of their<br />\nfinances and their night life.<br />\nWhen student government<br />\nbegins to have an impact in<br />\nareas close to students, those<br />\nstudents will care about what<br />\nstudent government is doing.<br />\nThis is what the Johns<br />\nHopkins Student Council will<br />\nattempt over the coming year.<br />\nWe.will attack first the questions which relate directly to a<br />\nlarge number of students. We<br />\nwant to make changes which<br />\nwill have an immediate impact<br />\nand which will have that impact<br />\nin the near future.<br />\nThis does not mean we have<br />\nto be short-sighted.

The presentation<br />\nis a joint effort by Ted<br />\nWrigley, the J.H.U. Orientation Committee, and the Barnstormers. Due to a shortage of<br />\nsummer Hopkins students,<br />\nWrigley's open auditions drew<br />\noutside talent. Only one of the<br />\nfour actors is a student, and<br />\nKathryn Ranniger Smith, who<br />\nplays Amanda Wingfield,<br />\nWilliams' class-conscious<br />\nsouthern-belle-past-her-prime,<br />\nis a woman in her early forties.<br />\nPerhaps this is why the play<br />\nworks so well. The mind does<br />\nnot have to attempt a conversion of age as in most student<br />\nproductions, and instead can<br />\nconcentrate on the show at<br />\nhand.<br />\nThe Glass Menagerie is a<br />\nproduction. Prosolid<br />\nducer/director Ted Wrigley, a<br />\nsenior at Hopkins, seems to<br />\nhave given his actors a fairly<br />\nfree reign over their parts, and<br />\nhe evokes smooth perforA<br />\nall.<br />\nfrom<br />\nmances<br />\ncamaraderie is established between the actors, and the intimacy of the Barn Theater<br />\n(and also the fact that there<br />\nwere a mere 20 people in the audience last Sunday night) lends<br />\nitself to a comfortable<br />\natmosphere\u2014as if we were<br />\npeeping through an apartment<br />\nwindow rather than observing<br />\na public performance.<br />\nSmith delivers perhaps the<br />\nmost skilled performance of the<br />\nfour actors. Her characterization of Amanda Wingfield, a<br />\nfunny, foolish, rather frantic<br />\nwoman, is never overdone.<br />\nWhile it would be easy to create<br />\na caricature of Amanda, Smith<br />\ntakes her from the nagging of<br />\nan all-too-recognizable mother<br />\nto the bragging repetitiveness of<br />\nan old woman's memories to<br />\nthe anger of a mother hurt by<br />\nher son, and yet never crosses<br />\nthat line. Smith's age is also a<br />\nfactor in her credibility. It<br />\nwould be difficult to imagine a<br />\nyounger actress attempting to<br />\nportray the mother of two<br />\nchildren in their twenties.<br />\nJimi Cohee as Tom is a<br />\nhighly believable angry young<br />\nman. The aspiring poet who<br />\nworks by day in a shoe<br />\nwarehouse and \"goes to the<br />\nmovies\" at night is a tragic example of stifled creativity.<br />\n\"People go to the movies instead of moving,\" he laments.<br />\nTom wants adventure and plans<br />\nto find it. \"I'm tired of the<br />\nmovies, he says, \"and I am<br />\nabout to move!\"<br />\nCalled \"Shakespeare\" by his<br />\nfriend Jim, Tom is our Greek<br />\nchorus, our giver of \"truth in<br />\nthe pleasant disguise of illusion.\" Cohee's voice, however,<br />\nis at times pretentious and<br />\npeculiar in relation to the other<br />\ncharacters and the setting of St.<br /><br />\nKathryn Ranniger Smith as Amanda Wingfield and Jimi Cohee as Tom<br /><br />\nLouis. He also plays too heavily at times, expressing unsuppressed irony when it should be<br />\nbarely suppressed and controlling his voice when he should be<br />\ngoing all out. Cohee loosens up<br />\nand is perhaps best in Scene IV<br />\nas the drunken Tom\u2014unable to<br />\nget the proverbial key in the<br />\ndoor, slurring his speech just<br />\nso, a happy grin on his handsome face. From this point on,<br />\ncharacter and actor are<br />\nliberated. It is as if the earlier<br />\ntirade that prompted Tom's indiscretion freed both character<br />\nand actor to delve for a more<br />\npure expression of emotion.<br />\nFor an actress to play Laura<br />\nwell, it is necessary to be very<br />\nunobtrusive. Laura is painfully shy, a girl who gets \"nervous<br />\nindigestion\" (she throws up)<br />\nfrom taking courses at a<br />\nbusiness college, and thus<br />\nquits, and a girl whose fragile<br />\nlife revolves around the fragile<br />\nfigurines of her glass<br />\nmenagerie. As Laura, Pippa<br />\nHailstone blends quietly into<br />\nbackgrounds and foregrounds<br />\nShe can be sitting on the floor<br />\nin front of an arguing Tom and<br />\nAmanda and go completely unnoticed until a lull in the \"conversation\" or a light movement<br />\non Hailstone's part draws our<br />\nsurprised attention to the pretty blonde with drawn eyebrows<br />\nand a prematurely wrinkled<br />\nforehead. Hailstone is excellent<br />\nin a part that gives little room<br />\nfor notice.<br />\nThe only weak part of the<br />\nshow is Toby Mordkoff as Jim<br />\nO'Connor, the gentleman<br />\ncaller. A special thanks is accorded in the program to Mordkoff \"for stepping in on short<br />\nnotice.\" Mordkott, a Hopkins<br />\nsophomore, while boisterous, is<br />\nnot quite up to par with the<br /><br />\nother actors. The rapport the<br />\nothers have seems to be<br />\nsomewhat less evident in<br />\ncharacterization, probably due<br />\nto lack of time to study the<br />\npart. Mordkoff, however, is a<br />\nvery likeable Jim, boyish and<br />\ncharming, though not without<br />\na bragging streak when confronted with Laura's obvious<br />\npunchy<br />\nHii<br />\nadulation.<br />\ncharacterization overrides his<br />\nword-stumbling and linedropping and delivers a fun, if<br />\nnot strong, performance.<br />\nBecause it is a \"memory<br />\nplay,\" Tennessee Williams considered the role of music in The<br />\nGlass Menagerie important. It<br />\nis Laura's music, and thus light<br />\nand rather sorrowful. Laura<br /><br />\nturns the music on to block out<br />\nwhat she does not want to<br />\nexperience\u2014reality. However,<br />\ninstead of the music weaving in<br />\nand out of our consciousness as<br />\nit was intended, it is more of a<br />\ndistraction.

Others, however,<br />\nare comfortable at Hopkins and believe Orientation<br />\nhas helped to ease their tensions. Most agree with Phil<br />\nManning that they shouldn't \"jump right in\" to the<br />\nroutine of school.<br />\nGenerally, freshmen think the pace of Orientation<br />\nallowed enough free time while also providing various<br />\nactivitieslor meeting new people. Liza Klein said the<br />\norientation period \"helped everyone to loosen up.\"<br />\nKatie Uzlyn welcomed Orientation as a time to make<br />\nfriends and \"to get to know her roommate.\"<br />\nThen there were those freshmen who thought the<br />\norientation period was a bit awkward and full of artificial, forced friendships. One freshman commented<br />\nthat most of her conversations with other freshman<br />\nrevolved around the following questions: \"What's<br />\nyour name?,\" \"Where are you from?,\" \"Where are<br /><br />\nc<br /><br />\nit<br />\ncl<br /><br />\nV<br /><br />\nIi<br />\nis<br /><br />\nNEWS-LETTER/11<br />\nyou living?,\" \"What's your major?\" and \"What do<br />\nyou think of the guys?\"<br />\nIlene Rosenzweig felt Orientation was like \"camp\".<br />\n\"The whole goal of Orientation is to socialize.

They can't ruin that. I'm happy with<br />\nthe Golden Grahams.\" Jose Ivey doesn't mind leaving his parents but he may miss their cooking. Jose<br />\ndescribes ARA food as \"about the worst thing I've<br />\never tasted.\" Phil Manning and Katie Uzlyn don't<br />\nthink the food is that bad and describe it as \"edible\".<br />\nSome of the freshmen are homesick. Sherry Emery<br />\nfrom Colorado, Susie Stickley from Spain and George<br />\nTing from Hong Kong believe it will be difficult living so far away from home. Phil Manning says he was<br />\n\"definitely ready to leave.\" Katie Uzlyn likes the<br />\ndistance trom her parents because now she will have<br />\na chance to \"be on her own.\" Marika Hrehorovich<br />\nof Baltimore' is glad to be living close to home.<br />\n\"Elopkins is not known for its wild spots.

Entering the last week of<br />\nMiddle Atlantic Conference action with a 3-3 league record<br />\n(15-13 overall), Jays needed to<br />\nsweep their remaining four<br />\ngames to cabture a tie for first<br />\nplace in the MAC Southeast.<br />\nWith one loss ending all hope<br />\nof post-season action, the Blue<br />\nJay pitching staff came<br />\nthrough, hurling three shutouts. Against Haverford freshman Mark Campbell tossed a<br />\nfive-hitter in the opening game<br />\nof a doubleheader, while Dave<br />\nProvost threw a three-hitter in<br />\nthe nightcap.<br /><br />\nSeveral Blue Jays earned individual honors. Pitcher Steve<br />\nHand was named to the MAC<br />\nFirst Team All-Stars with a 7-3<br />\nrecord and a 1.60 ERA. First<br />\nbaseman/pitcher Mark Campbell was named to the MAC<br />\nSecond Team All-Stars with a<br />\n.266 batting average and a 1.57<br />\nERA on the hill.<br />\nBoth Hand and Campbell<br />\nwere among the nation's<br />\nleaders in Earned Run Average.<br />\nJunior Captain Andy Lachance<br />\nwas named to the MAC First<br />\nTeam All-Stars for the second<br />\nstraight year. Lachance batted<br />\na team high .330 with 17 RBI's<br />\nwhile playing a solid second<br />\nbase.<br /><br />\nCraig Brooks singles against Widener.<br /><br />\nThe following day the Blue<br />\nJays hosted the Ursinus College<br />\nBears in a crucial MAC twinbill. Senior Steve Hand fired<br />\nHopkins' third consecutive<br />\nshutout. Andy Lachance and<br />\nCraig Brooks were the hitting<br />\nstars in the Jays' 3-0 victory.<br />\nIn the second game freshman<br />\nGeoff Bender upped his record<br />\nto 2-3 with relief help from<br />\nMark Campbell in a thrilling<br />\n7-5 victory. The doubleheader<br />\nsweep gave Hopokins a tie for<br />\nfirst place in the MAC Southeast with Widener as both<br />\nteams ended with identical 7-3<br />\nrecords.<br />\nThe Jays traveled to Widener for a playot t game to decide<br />\nthe league championship.<br />\nHopkins broke a 1-1 tie in the<br />\ntop of the eighth inning on a<br />\nwalk to James Cardwell and<br />\nsingles by Scott Burns and<br />\nCraig Brooks.<br />\nEntering the bottom of the<br />\n9th, Hopkins held a 3-1 lead.<br />\nHowever,a walk, single and hit<br />\nbatsman loaded the bases for<br />\nWidener with one out. Coach<br />\nBob Babb brought in Steve<br />\nHand in an attempt to end the<br />\nthreat. Hand responded by<br />\nstriking out the first batter he<br />\nfaced. He then went one ball<br />\nand two strikes to Widener's<br />\nnext batter. One strike away<br />\nfrom a victory, the Jays were<br />\ndisappointed as the next pitch<br />\nwas lined to center. The ball<br />\nwas misplayed and all three<br />\nrunners crossed the plate, turning Hopkins 3-1 lead into a 4-3<br />\nloss. Coach Babb called lithe<br />\n\"toughest game I've ever been<br />\ninvolved with.\"<br />\nTwo games followed this<br />\nheartbreaker\u2014a 4-0 victory<br />\nover Gettysburgh and an 18-6<br />\nloss to Salisbury State. Dave<br />\nProvost pitched his second<br />\nstraight shutout against Gettysburgh raising his record to<br />\n5-2.<br />\nThe Jays' final record was<br />\n20-13. The thirty-three games<br />\nrepresent the most ever played<br />\nby a Blue Jay team, and the 20<br />\nwin mark was reached for only<br />\nthe third time in Blue Jay<br />\nhistory.

Grogan<br />\nAfter three (count 'em<br />\nthree) years at Hopkins, I<br />\ndecided last week that physically, I am unfit. The onefingered-page-flip, the Orgobook-tuck-and-carry and the<br />\nend-of-class-one-handeddesktop-toss are simply not<br />\nenough to keep one in condi-<br /><br />\ntion. Therefore, like a good student, I resolved to read up on<br />\nphysical fitness.<br />\nSeven volumes and 1623 onefingered-page-flips later I had a<br />\ngreat headache, but I was no<br />\ncloser to being fit. I decided to<br />\nconsult some experts. But who?<br />\nNaturally, those paragons of<br />\naerobic fitness\u2014the cross country team.<br /><br />\nAfter a quick search of<br />\nschool, I looked into a sleazy<br />\nbar and saw them\u2014nine skinny, beer-drinking guys who<br />\ncould never be mistaken for a<br />\nfootball squad. One tipped<br />\nback his beer, finished it, yelled \"Airborne\" and hurled it<br />\nagainst the wall: Another, who<br />\nlooked like a relic from Atilla's<br />\nhordes, called me over.<br /><br />\n\"Sit down. Whaddya<br />\nwant?\" I replied that I came in<br />\nsearch of fitness.<br />\n\"You've come to the wrong<br />\nplace.

This represents<br />\none of the largest turnouts in<br />\nthe team's six years. The only<br />\nsenior lost to_graduation was<br />\nKathy Connally. Though Connally was one of the squad's top<br />\nrunners, the addition of a<br />\nnumber of freshmen should<br />\nmore than make up for her loss.<br />\nThree freshmen, Angel Dean,<br />\nCissy King and Anne Marie<br />\nUlrick, were actively recruited<br />\nlast spring. Coach Gary Green<br />\nis excited about these freshmen<br />\nrunners. \"They have been<br />\ntremendous performers in high<br />\nschool and will significantly<br />\nadd to our team strength,\" said<br />\nGreen.<br />\nThis season the team will<br />\nbenefit from the addition of<br /><br />\nassistant coach Eleanor Simonsick. A '79 Hopkins graduate,<br />\nSimonsick is a world class runner who recently returned from<br />\nNorway, where she represented<br />\nthe United States in the World<br />\nTrack and Field Championships at the 10 kilometer<br />\ndistance. She will assist the<br />\nteam by making up workouts<br /><br />\nand giving advice. Other<br />\nchanges this season will include<br />\nincreased emphasis on weight<br />\ntraining, track workouts, stretching and participation in area<br />\nroad races.<br />\nAfter finishing seventh out of<br />\n15 MAC schools last year, the<br />\nteam hopes to win the conference championships this fall.<br /><br />\nThis season looks challenging<br />\nwith meets scheduled against<br />\nthe always strong Mary Washington, Gettysburg and Franklin and Marshall.

The runner's high?\"<br />\n\"Kind of, the high of survival. You run a race, it's life<br />\nand death. Running is meeting<br />\nyour maker and getting another<br />\nchance to live. Running's not<br />\nfitness, it's religious, it's selfdiscovery.\"<br />\n\"But it's a team sport, too.\"<br />\n\"Yeah.\"<br />\n\"So how are you guys gonna do?\"<br />\n\"Well...our coach would<br />\nsay 'What's important is each<br />\nperson's fulfilling his own potential and to the extent that we do<br />\nthat, we will have success, not<br />\njust in a spiritual sense, but<br />\nmaterially as well, with victories<br />\nand prizes.' But that's a<br />\ncrock ... we run so we are successful.
