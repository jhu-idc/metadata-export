Not only<br />\nwas there a larger attendance than<br />\nusual, but the whole crowd seemed<br />\nespecially gay and lively, owing to<br />\nthe double victoyy in the afternoon<br />\nover Western Maryland and Cornell. The class . flags were seen<br />\nagain, cards were confused, everybody came late, and the dance fully<br />\nconformed to all traditions, the only<br />\ndifference being that it was, if anything, more successful than most of<br />\nthe others.<br />\nThe 1912-13 season has marked<br />\nseveral changes in the Cotillon<br />\nClub's dances. Chief of these is<br />\nthe selection of a non-fraternity<br />\nmember for the Board, which, up<br />\nuntil this year, has consisted wholly<br />\nof representatives from the various<br />\nfraternities. Another change is the<br />\n\u2022 separation of the office of secretarytreasurer into the two offices of<br />\nsecretary and treasurer; although<br />\nthis change seems to be due merely<br />\nto the fact that there were three<br />\nsenior members of the Board this<br />\nyear, and it was thought best to<br />\ndivide the honots fairly.<br />\nMore noticeable to visitors is the<br />\nintroduction of a receiving line at<br />\nthe beginning of each dance. This<br />\nfeature is a great improvement and<br />\nshould be continued; it gives an opportunity for the girls to meet the<br />\nchaperons without the sometimes<br />\nawkward stopping in the middle of<br />\na dance.<br />\nOn the whole, the season has been<br />\nvery successful, and it indicates that<br />\nthe Cotillon Club is, and will continue to be, in a flourishing condition.<br />\nAnnually at the banquet of the<br />\nsophomores of the University of<br />\nNorth Carolina those freshmen who<br />\nhave so distinguished themselves as<br />\nto warrant attention receive their reward at the hands of a sophomore<br />\ncommittee in the shape of names,<br />\nviz.:<br />\nClarkson, St. Francis.

Six hundred and fifty of<br />\nthese tickets were sent last week to<br />\nthe City College and they were also<br />\ndistributed in like quantities at all<br />\nthe other preparatory schools of the<br />\ncity.

It is expected that<br />\nGeorgetown will present a strong<br />\nline-up. Last year one of their<br />\nteam was Norris McLean, the well<br />\nknown intercity player, in 1910 joint<br />\nholder with \"Babe\" Fisher of the<br />\nWest Virginia Doubles Championship, and the same year runner-up<br />\nin the District of Columbia singles<br />\ntournament.

Morriss and Judge Alfred S. Niles. Mr. F. C. Kuehn,<br />\n'II, the musician of the evening,<br />\nplayed several pieces of classical<br />\nmusic really exquisitely. Everyone<br />\npresent was delighted with the orations made by the contestants\u2014<br />\nwhich were of an unusually high<br />\norder, even in comparison with<br />\nthose delivered at the previous contests in oratory. The only disappointing feature of the evening, to<br />\nHopkins men at any rate, was that<br />\nJ. C. Uhler, Hopkins' representative<br />\nin the contest, was not awarded one<br />\nof the prizes by the judges. He<br />\nspoke in a simple and unaffected<br />\nmanner in his clear, musical voice,<br />\nhis chief asset. He failed, however,<br />\nto deduce from his long list of well<br />\nselected facts any really important<br />\ngeneral principles.<br />\nThe first speaker, Mr. D. L. Waldron, of Georgetown University, won<br />\nthe second prize. He was clearly<br />\nthe greatest orator of the evening,<br />\nbut he allowed himself to be carried<br />\naway from the dignified and eloquent expression of his thoughts<br />\ninto the expression of ideas which<br />\nprobably were not clear to the<br />\nspeaker, and certainly not so to the<br />\naudience.<br />\nThe second speaker, Mr. W.

His voice had no real<br />\nrichness, but his thoughts were expressed.clearly and logically, though<br />\nhe was not as inspiring as Many of<br />\nthe other speakers.

Not only<br />\nwas there a larger attendance than<br />\nusual, but the whole crowd seemed<br />\nespecially gay and lively, owing to<br />\nthe double victoyy in the afternoon<br />\nover Western Maryland and Cornell. The class . flags were seen<br />\nagain, cards were confused, everybody came late, and the dance fully<br />\nconformed to all traditions, the only<br />\ndifference being that it was, if anything, more successful than most of<br />\nthe others.<br />\nThe 1912-13 season has marked<br />\nseveral changes in the Cotillon<br />\nClub's dances. Chief of these is<br />\nthe selection of a non-fraternity<br />\nmember for the Board, which, up<br />\nuntil this year, has consisted wholly<br />\nof representatives from the various<br />\nfraternities. Another change is the<br />\n\u2022 separation of the office of secretarytreasurer into the two offices of<br />\nsecretary and treasurer; although<br />\nthis change seems to be due merely<br />\nto the fact that there were three<br />\nsenior members of the Board this<br />\nyear, and it was thought best to<br />\ndivide the honots fairly.<br />\nMore noticeable to visitors is the<br />\nintroduction of a receiving line at<br />\nthe beginning of each dance. This<br />\nfeature is a great improvement and<br />\nshould be continued; it gives an opportunity for the girls to meet the<br />\nchaperons without the sometimes<br />\nawkward stopping in the middle of<br />\na dance.<br />\nOn the whole, the season has been<br />\nvery successful, and it indicates that<br />\nthe Cotillon Club is, and will continue to be, in a flourishing condition.<br />\nAnnually at the banquet of the<br />\nsophomores of the University of<br />\nNorth Carolina those freshmen who<br />\nhave so distinguished themselves as<br />\nto warrant attention receive their reward at the hands of a sophomore<br />\ncommittee in the shape of names,<br />\nviz.:<br />\nClarkson, St. Francis.
