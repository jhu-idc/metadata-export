It is fitting that, chemistry should be the first, for it<br />\nis the oldest of sciences, having been discovered by Benjamin Franklin in 468 B.C. when an apple fell on his head<br />\nwhile he was shooting the breeze with Pythagoras one<br />\nday outside the Acropolis.(The reason they were outside<br />\nthe Acropolis and not inside was that Pythagoras had been<br />\nthrown out for drawing right triangles all over the walls.)<br /><br />\nTI<br /><br />\n\u2018eiz<br />\ntvd5.61/001/r/O.Ifre.ftreez ktAiii6Ord6e*<br />\nThey had several meetings outside the Acropolis, but<br />\nfilially Franklin said, \"Look, Pythagoras, this is nothing<br />\nagainst you, see, but I'm no youngster anymore and if<br />\nkeep laying around on this wet grass with you, I'm<br />\nliable to get the breakbone fever.

We were beginning a discussion of chemistry, and the best way to begin is with fundamentals.<br />\nChemicals are divided into elements. There are four: air,<br />\nearth, fire, and water. Any number of delightful combinations can be made from these elements, such as firewater,<br />\ndacron, and chef's salad.<br />\nChemicals can be further divided into the classes of<br />\nexplosive and non-explosive. A wise chemist always<br />\ntouches a match to his chemicals before he begins an<br />\nexperiment.<br />\nA variety of vessels of different sizes and shapes are<br />\nused in a chemistry lab. There are tubes, vials, beakers,<br />\nflasks, pipettes, and retorts. A retort is also a snappy comeback,such as \"Oh, yeah?\" and \"So's your Uncle Oscar:\"<br />\nI have now told you the most important aspects of<br />\nchemistry, but there are many more\u2014far too many to<br />\ncover in the space remaining here.
