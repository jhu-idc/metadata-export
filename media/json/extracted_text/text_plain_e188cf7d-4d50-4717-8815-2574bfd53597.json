Beneath our feet the fragrant, slippery needles make us fearful of mishap. For ten remembered days<br />\nten loyal sons of Hopkins dwelt amid this \"solitude of pines with soft brown<br />\nSilences carpeted.\"<br />\n<br />\n(1.3'<br />\n<br />\n\"Yet not for all this beauty would I seek<br />\nThis lovely vale, but for more glorious things;<br />\nThere shines the sun that shall go down no more;<br />\nThere flows the fountain that shall water earth;<br />\nThere bursts the glory that shall never pale ;<br />\nThere springs the life with which death strives in vain;<br />\nThere are the golden chains prepared and forged<br />\nWhich knit our earth to heaven; there also stands<br />\nThe more than golden ladder which connects<br />\nThose lower chambers with the upper halls.\"<br />\n<br />\nAttractive as is the natural beauty of the place, the motive of the seven<br />\nhundred college men who gathered there this summer, not only in the camp but<br />\nin the less attractive dormitories of the Seminary, was rather the hope of spiritual awakening, to which the very beauty of the place itself conduces.<br />\nAt this Sixteenth Annual Conference, twenty-nine different nationalities<br />\nwere represented, and one hundred and forty-nine institutions of learning.<br />\nYale as usual led in attendance (120), with Princeton second. Hopkins was<br />\none of twelve colleges having nine or more delegates presentThe spiritual impressions were made at platform meetings, in the morning<br />\nand at night on each day by thirty-eight speakers of renown. The first few<br />\ndais were especially marked by the addresses of Mr. Morgan, as were the clos-<br />\n<br />\n\f2<br />\n<br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\n<br />\ning days by those of Mr. Robert Speer. To conserve and deepen these impressions, Bible classes, a Missionary Institute, and other departments were led by<br />\ncompetent men, among whom were Profs Bosworth and King of Oberlin, and<br />\nSanders of Yale. As there were present twenty-eight foreign delegates, the<br />\nmissionary interest was very strong, and Hopkins should rejoice to know that<br />\ntwo of her ten men volunteered for the foreign field while there.<br />\nAwakened amid the twitter of the early birds by the pulling of your cot<br />\nfrom beneath your weary bones, you bathe your sleepy eyes in mountain dew<br />\nstolen from your neighbor's pail, and are hardly through with your lavations<br />\nbefore the clang of a high-sounding cymbal calls you to the morning \"hashhouse\" meal (if it be not some mischievous chap abusing his wash-basin.)<br />\nAbout you at the table are many men of many minds from many colleges, in<br />\nmany stages of attire, calling lustily for the \"pump\" or the \"cow'S\u2014as their<br />\ntaste or rather thirst may dictate.<br />\nA missionary institute at eight, or a Bible class at nine, calls you across<br />\nfields<br />\ntenanted with bleating sheep to the group of Seminary buildings not<br />\nthe<br />\nfar away. At ten in the large Auditorium you hear such addresses by the very<br />\nforemost religious thinkers as are seldom offered elsewhere. Back to camp for<br />\ndinner, you have the afternoon for personal talks with the leading men of the<br />\nconference, or for sport. If the latter, perhaps today it is a plunge into the<br />\ncool waters of the nearby Connecticut just as Nature made you, tomorrow a<br />\ntramp through the three adjoining states of Vermont, New Hampshire and<br />\nMassachusetts, or perhaps a long drive, with the rest of your delegation, amid<br />\nthe beautiful hills with which the region abounds, and from which vistas of<br />\nnatural beauty present pictures that still linger in your mind. Yet within<br />\nthe Seminary grounds are found abundant opportunities for athletic endeavor.<br />\nRegular match games of base-ball are scheduled between teams of the attending colleges, a tennis tournament, with singles and doubles, a golf tournament,<br />\nand on ,the Fourth of July a special field day. This year Yale won the chain<br />\npionship in these events; R. H. Schauffler of Princeton defeated Ludington of<br />\nYale in a closely contested tennis tournament. These two colleges also played<br />\nthe finals for the baseball championship, Yale winning by a score of ten to<br />\nseven. As yet Hopkins has had no part in these games, but as she is gradually<br />\ncoming into more prominence in other lines, it, behooves the athletic element<br />\namong us to look out for Hopkins' honors in that direction also.<br />\nAt sunset the Conference gathers on 'Round Top\" where rests the body<br />\nof Mr. Moody, and \"Life-work Talks\" are given by men prominent in the different professions. These are perhaps the most stirring addresses in the ten<br />\ndays' program. From \"Round Top\" across the hills to the Auditorium for<br />\nthe platform meeting of the evening, you go amid the glories of a Northfield<br />\nsunset. There below is the calm, green valley, beautiful in its stillness, with<br />\nits meadows, its clustering houses and trees, the shining river curving through<br />\nthe midst, and beyond, the best of all, the everlasting hills with their constantly<br />\nchanging lights and shadows. Presently twilight falls and soon a hundred<br />\nlights from \"Hermon's wooded hill\" flash out, and nearby the Seminary lights<br />\nare also gleaming.<br />\n<br />\n\fTHE NEWS\u2014LETTER.<br />\n<br />\n3<br />\n<br />\nAt 9.30 you wend your way to the camp guided by the moon's soft rays,<br />\nand there, in the quiet second thought following the evening's address, are held<br />\nDelegation Meetings,\" in which the fellows come to know each other as never<br />\nbefore. Then to peaceful slumbers amid the stately pines\u2014provided no \"rough<br />\nhouse\" is on foot to disturb the wee hours of the morn.<br />\nFourth of July night is a gala occasion never forgotten by those participating. The large Auditorium is profusely decorated with college and state colors,<br />\na certain pro rata space being assigned te each college. Lockstep marching to<br />\ncollege tunes prevails all over the house for half an hour, and then after an ad\u2022<br />\ndress by Pres. Seth Low on \"The Responsibilities of the College Man to the<br />\nState,\" each delegation has an opportunity to give its yell, sing a song, if large<br />\nenough, do any \"stunt\" of special attraction that can be devised. In this Hopkins is in the van; \"the hit\" of the evening being that arranged for the \"Medical Schools of Baltimore.\" A skeleton specially devised and sheeted with skull,<br />\narm, and foot distinctly visible, previously concealed behind the platform suddenly rushes out over the heads of the astonished multitude during the singing<br />\nof our song, along the supporting ropes reaching to the vaulted roof float the<br />\nbanners of the different medical schools of Baltimore.<br />\nThe responses of the foreign delegates form a chief feature of the evening,<br />\nespecially those of the dozen Japanese students, whose singing(?) rivals that of<br />\nthe Hopkins Glee Club. The jolly times with these foreign delegates when they<br />\nvisited the camp will be long remembered. Pastor Hoffman, of Geneva, who<br />\nStyled himself \"The Veldt's Committee,\" a chief justice of Hungary, a native<br />\nlawyer from Labore, and many others of exceedingly attractive personality<br />\nmingled with delightful and helpful freedom among the fellows at our camp.<br />\nOne event worth special mention was the large reception given the entire<br />\nconference by the Yale delegation in East Hall. Another was the \"night shirt<br />\nbrigade\" which arose, like the mushroon, to full strength in a single night.<br />\nStarted by only a handful at the top of the hill in the dead of night, not twenty<br />\nminutes passed before every man in camp had either arisen in response to the<br />\ncall \"everybody out\" or had suffered his cot to depart from under him, and his<br />\nbedclothes to be scattered to the wind.<br />\nA hundred and twenty fellows in pajamas sitting on the top rail of a worm<br />\nfence at one thirty a. m., singing \"Good Night Ladies\" was certainly worthy<br />\nof a flashlight and further investigation.<br />\nTime and space would fail to tell of what we did; all that ten loyal Hopkinsians could devise was done. Is not that enough?<br />\nThose in the delegation, which was the same size as last year, were Dr. P.<br />\nS. Evans, Jr., Med., C. K. Edmunds,'97, A. W. Freeman, G. S., R. L. McAll,<br />\n'00, A.

We have deemed it ad-<br />\n<br />\nt<br />\n<br />\nvisable to adopt the present shape for several reasons, the most important<br />\nof which is that we believe our readers will find the present magazine<br />\nform more desirable and less inconvenient to handle than the old design. In<br />\nthe course of the ensuing year the NEWS-LETTER desires to come into close<br />\ntouch with every student of the University, and in order to accomplish this<br />\nevery effort will be made to publish such news as will interest all Hopkins<br />\nstudents. With this end in view we propose to extend our field to the Medical<br />\nSchool, to devote a portion of each issue to Medical School items, and to supplement our present staff of editors by the addition of a Medical School Editor.<br />\nWith the exception of the \"Hullabaloo,\" the NEWS-LETTER is the only<br />\nstudent publication at Hopkins, and for this reason we wish every student to<br />\ntake a personal interest in the paper. It is yours, support it, encourage it, improve it by helpful criticism given in proper spirit, and in return it will endeavor<br />\nto give you a representative college journal.<br />\nURING the past five months misfortune has dealt us several cruel blows.<br />\nNever before in the history of the University has death claimed so many<br />\nof our Faculty in so brief a period of time. Just before the university<br />\nclosed last spring, the whole scientific world was called upon to mourn with us<br />\nthe loss of one its greatest thinkers and inventors\u2014Professor Rowland.<br />\nAs we commence our 26th academic year we find three distinguished names<br />\nmissing from our Faculty roll\u2014Dr. Herbert B.

Sutphen, Instructor in Latin. The<br />\nloss to an institution, of four such men cannot be estimated, it can, however,<br />\nbe felt\u2014felt most deeply.<br />\n<br />\nt<br />\n<br />\nHE halls of old Johns Hopkins are open for another academic year, and<br />\nanother class, untutored and untrained along the lines of University<br />\nthought and action has entered.<br />\nTo the'class, known in the college world as Freshinan, the NEWS-LETTIM<br />\nextends its greeting and a bit of advice. Remember, first of all, that you are<br />\nnow an integral part of a great University, and the position carries with it a<br />\ncertain amount of responsibility; your alma mater is beginning a great work for<br />\nYOU; in return you owe her something, nor is this duty entirely absolved by<br />\nfaithful and constant effort in class work, for apart from the high standard of<br />\nscholarship necessary in order to be a Hopkins student, there are certain other<br />\nresponsibilities devolving upon you. The first of these is unswerving loyalty<br />\nto the Black and Blue, a loyalty stronger and deeper than a mere preparatory<br />\nschool affiliation, a loyalty which, despite storm and tempest, will never be<br />\nShaken, Perhaps you have some latent talent, beside your natural inclination (?)<br />\nto study. If such be the case now is the time to bring it forth. The students<br />\nmaintain athletic teams, musical clubs, and two publications. If athletically<br />\ninclined try for a place on the foot ball, lacrosse, or track and field team; if<br />\nmusic proves the greater charm there are Glee, Banjo and Mandolin Clubs; if<br />\nYou have a bent for the literary side there is the NEWS-LETTER. Last of all,<br />\nbut by no means least, there is your support which all three of the above named<br />\ndepartments of undergraduate effort need and solicit. Other classes have lived<br />\nUp to expectations, shown college spirit, supported college institutions\u2014now<br />\nlireshmen \"go and do likewise.\"<br />\n<br />\nG<br />\n<br />\nACH year we notice the increasing tendency among American colleges to<br />\nemulate the example of the Johns Hopkins University in two important<br />\nrespects, the first of which is to reduce from four to three years the course<br />\nof study leading to the degree of Bachelor of Arts, and second to require an A.<br />\nB. from students wishing to take up the study of medicine. Within the past<br />\ntwo years the University of Pennsylvania has adopted the latter course, and<br />\nseveral other medical universities now announce the same policy. Beyond<br />\nquestion this is excellent policy. A man taking up medicine as a profession<br />\nShould have something more than a mere elementary knowledge of the first<br />\nPrinciples of education. Yet many medical schools admit men who have not<br />\nCompleted their public school course. As a consequence the finished products<br />\nturned out\" by the institutions of medicine are not of a finished nature. On<br />\nthe other hand it is advisable to reduce the length of the under-graduate course<br />\nand place an A. B. within reach of a man after a period of three instead of four<br />\nYears work. The extra year thus gained means a great deal to many a young<br />\nman who enters the field of medicine, law, or any kindred science requiring a<br />\nSpecial course. At the same time he may feel that he is in no sense a loser, for<br />\n<br />\n\f6<br />\n<br />\nTHE NEWS\u2014LETTER.<br />\n<br />\nthe three year curriculum of to-day embraces as much as the four year curriculum of twenty or thirty years ago. More attention is paid to the practical side<br />\nof knowledge, and effort is made to school the college man of to-day in those<br />\nstudies which will be of the greatest use to him in after life. Even to the man<br />\nwho contemplates entering business at the expiration of his undergraduate<br />\ncourse, the three year curriculum will be of advantage, for as the term of college<br />\nlife is shortened every effort will be made to conform the course to the<br />\nstudent's needs,concentrating his energies upon the most useful subjects for his<br />\nbranch of work, and eliminating those which will be of little advantage to him.<br />\nFinally, in an age of hurry, of stimulated energy, and gigantic enterprise, an<br />\nage in which every hour is of importance and value to a man entering a business career, a young man is given the advantage of another year, and thus<br />\nenabled to begin the struggle for existence one year sooner.<br />\nHE Hopkins foot ball season has opened under the most auspicious<br />\ncircumstances. It is true our team has been somewhat crippled by the<br />\nloss of several of last year's best players. Still, judging from the<br />\namount of interest and enthusiasm manifested by the students, and particularly<br />\nthe students of the Medical School, it is probable that this year's team will be<br />\none of the best Hopkins has ever put upon the field. The securing of a firstclass coach is an innovation, the advantages of which cannot be too strongly<br />\nemphasized. In securing Mr. Dickson of University of Pennsylvania, the<br />\nUniversity has taken a step in the right direction, the significance of which will<br />\nbe better appreciated when the foot ball season is more advanced. Through<br />\nthe generosity of the musical clubs in so kindly donating one hundred dollars,<br />\nthe foot ball team will start a training table.<br />\nIn order that the entire student body may have an opportunity to witness<br />\nthe games this fall, the management has decided to issue season tickets, admitting to five games, for one dollar and a half, thus selling admissions to five<br />\ngames for the price of three.<br />\n<br />\nZ<br />\n<br />\nFACULTY VACATIONS.<br />\nR. REMSEN spent a very profitable and refreshing summer in New England. He began with a walking trip through the Berkshire Hills, Massachusetts, as was his habit when a professor at Williams College.<br />\nAfterwards he was at Springfield, Massachusetts, and Northeast Harbor, Maine,<br />\nbeing at the latter place a next door neighbor of Dr. Gilman. Besides this outdoor activity, Dr. Remsen employed his leisure in preparing for the printer<br />\nanother of his series of chemistry text-books.<br />\nDr. Osier, Hopkins professor of medicine, traveled during the summer<br />\nmonths in England and on the Continent, taking time to attend the London<br />\nTuberculosis Congress. Dr. Osler says great physicians no longer think much<br />\nof drugs in the treatment of this disease. It is now regarded as contagious,<br />\nand the best treatment is considered to consist in the proper inspection, sanitation, and other hygienic measures.<br />\n<br />\n9<br />\n<br />\n\fTHE NEWS\u2014LETTER.<br />\n<br />\n11<br />\n<br />\nATHLETICS.<br />\n41<br />\n<br />\nFOOT BALL SCHEDULE.

In all branches<br />\nmen have been lost,\u2014some by graduation, some by \"quituation,\" and still<br />\nothers have been compelled to forego all sports for the sake of their University<br />\nwork.<br />\nIn football, in track and field work, and in lacrosse heavy losses have been<br />\nsustained. The foot ball team has lost such men as Hancock, Butler, Morse,<br />\nSchmitters, Meadows, Bruton, Riggs, and others who aided us to victory last<br />\nYear. To he sure, their places in part have been filled by the acquisition of new<br />\nmen from the freshmen ranks and the further developement of such stand-bys as<br />\nBlanck, Straus, Yearley and Sayler; but the whipping into shape of the new<br />\nmen gives the team a hard handicap to overcome.<br />\nThe track team has lost Whitman, the man who could sprint, and who<br />\ncould equally well put the shot. Riggs refuses to enter athletics again, saying<br />\nthat his work at the medical school has become of such a nature that he can not<br />\nafford to slight it \"at this stage of the game.\" Others, too, have gone whose<br />\naid in winning victories for the Black and Blue will be sorely missed. But<br />\nmany of the old men have returned who will furnish the bone and sinew for the<br />\nteam, and, no doubt, will get together a team worthy of the University.<br />\nThe lacrosse squad has been diminished by the graduation of Bruton,<br />\nBandel, and Tyler from the collegiate department, and of Maddren from the<br />\nMedical School. Maddren's loss will be most keenly felt, for aside from playing the game in a masterly fashion, he knew all its fine points, and has for a<br />\ncouple of years acted as head coach for our team. Abercrombie, Briscoe, and<br />\nB. M. Bernheim are at the Medical School, and the remainder of the team is<br />\nstill in the undergraduate department. The loss in number does not appear<br />\nespecially great, but when the ability of the men is taken into consideration the<br />\nheavy loss can be appreciated.<br />\nThe incoming class seems very enthusiastic over all sorts of sports, so we<br />\ndo not think that there can he much doubt as to the superiority of our teams for<br />\n<br />\n5<br />\n<br />\n\f4<br />\n<br />\n12<br />\n<br />\nTHE NEWS\u2014LETTER.<br />\n<br />\nthe coming year. But let us impress upon all the necessity of all turning out.<br />\n\"No,\" we hear you say, \"what's the use of my trying to do anything. I am<br />\nworthless, so why should I go to the trouble of 'turning out.'\" No, my friend,<br />\nyou are not \"worthless.\" Come out and show your spirit, and do your best,<br />\nsomething will happen. Some of the best athletes ever produced at this Uni versity were men like you. They had to be coaxed to come out. They thought<br />\nthemselves \"good for nothing,\" but when they got under the care of a trainer,<br />\nthey developed, and showed such magnificent qualities that they really surprised<br />\nthemselves<br />\nSo, young man, come out, and do your level best for her whom we all love\u2014<br />\nour Alma Mater.<br />\nPROSPECT FOR FOOT BALL.<br />\nUST at present Foot Ball is the engrossing topic. This year Hopkins has<br />\ntwo entirely new features to boast of, viz.: a coach and a training table.<br />\nMr. Dickson, of the U. of P., will handle the men during the season, and<br />\nexpresses the opinion that a winning team will do the honors for Old Tom<br />\nHopkins on the gridiron. The team will, no doubt, be lighter than last year's,<br />\naveraging not over 150 lbs., but this feature will be supplemented by speed and<br />\nconcerted team work. There's lots of new material this year and some of it<br />\nappears to be very good, but we can make no prophecies just yet, as the task<br />\nof weeding out the team has not begun. All the candidates are, however, to<br />\nbe congratulated on their enthusiasm and interest as shown by the large<br />\n,numbers which are present for daily practice. There is a rumor afloat that<br />\nseveral Meds, besides those who have already shown up will join these swelling<br />\nranks of Black and Blue Warriors, and there is some splendid material in the<br />\nMedical School. The first game is with Rock Hill, at the American League<br />\nPark, Saturday, and we prophesy that Rock Hill will count her score with<br />\none oval figure. Season tickets will be sold this year at $1.50 for the entire<br />\nschedule of games to be played by J. H. U. in Baltimore, including all the<br />\nchampionship games, also the game with U. of Md. We add in conclusion:<br />\nEverybody out next Saturday, the rooting promises to be something fierce; woe<br />\nunto the freshman whose chubby face is not to be seen there.<br />\n<br />\n3<br />\n<br />\nTHE GALLERY.<br />\nMPROVEMENT is the mark of the age. Last year THE NEWS LETTER<br />\nseveral times called attention to changes being made in and around the<br />\nGymnasium building, and this year, for the first time is it noticed that<br />\naccommodations for visitors and onlookers in the cage are both sufficient and<br />\nconvenient. The gallery was spoken of two years ago and finally built during<br />\nthe last few weeks of last season. So far the gallery leads in the list of<br />\nimprovements to our athletic accommodations which began with the building<br />\nof the cage some few years ago and have continued ever since. Some day we<br />\nwill have a swimming pool, Thanks, Mack!<br />\n<br />\n3<br />\n<br />\n\fTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\n<br />\n.<br />\n<br />\n13<br />\n<br />\nNow that the gallery is ready for occupancy by interested spectators of<br />\nteam practice, would it be out of place to remind students and others that one<br />\nof the main purposes in building it was to save the running track? Formerly<br />\nthe track was at the mercy of all onlookers in the cage, and it required Mack's<br />\nbest efforts to keep it in any sort of condition for his men to train. Now we<br />\nShould all remember that the cage is for players, the track for runners and the<br />\ngallery for spectators.<br />\nOUR PHILIPPINE DEPARTMENT.<br />\nOHNS Hopkins is the first institution in the country to start a course of<br />\ninstruction in the dialects, manners and customs of our Eastern possessions. For some time past, the University ha been collecting the available<br />\nliterature concerning the habits and language of the Filipinos, and now the library contains practically all the books of any value on these subjects to be had<br />\nin this country. Dr. Haupt, head of the department of Semitic languages, will<br />\nhave immediate supervision of the work. The first course offered is an elective<br />\nin Tagalog, given by Mr. F. R. Blake, formerly a fellow of the University. Mr.<br />\nBlake has specialized in Sanskrit and in the Semitic languages. As the Malay<br />\ndialects are mixtures of Sanskrit and Arabic, he is especially well qualified for<br />\nthe work. Since all the valuable works on this subject are in Spanish or German, Mr. Blake is preparing an English manual of the dialects used on the<br />\nislands, designed both for students and for general use.<br />\nIt is hard to overestimate the importance of this department, and the honor<br />\naccruing to the Hopkins for its enterprise in founding it. In Dr. Haupt's words,<br />\nconcerning the great Sepoy rebellion, \"if the English authorities had consulted<br />\nanybody familiar with the prejudices of the natives, they would never have<br />\ncompelled the use of those bullets greased with the fat that was an abomination<br />\nto Hindoo and Mohommedan alike. The U. S. Bureau of Ethnology has<br />\nalready saved to the Government millions of dollars in its dealings with the<br />\nIndians.\" From this is seen the necessity to our country, soon to be a power<br />\nin the Orient, of such courses and instructions.<br />\nDr. Haupt has also in view an encyclopedia of the industries, the economical, political, and religious life of the Philippines. For this work, also to be<br />\nPublished under the auspices of the Hopkins, there has already been enlisted<br />\nthe assistance of Dr. A. B. Meyer, of Dresden, and Dr. Blumentritt, of Seilmeritz.<br />\n<br />\n3<br />\n<br />\nFRESHMAN PRIMER.<br />\nLESSON HI.<br />\n<br />\nYes, my darlings, always do what the Juniors tell you to do. You may<br />\nwear Sister Maggie's dress skirts as kilts and carry along the baby's feeding<br />\napparatus. The malted milk drops and Mellin's Food Sandwiches must be<br />\ntaken each day for lunch. If you are punched in the mug, say \"goo, goo!'<br />\n<br />\n\f14<br />\n<br />\nTHE NEWS\u2014LETTER.<br />\n<br />\nbut don't run away. The Juniors love you, and will make you feel queer. So<br />\nbe happy.<br />\nLESSON IV.<br />\nWhose child is this? It looks around as if it were lost. It really seems to<br />\nhave lost the lower portion of its pantaloons. Hit it with an Indian club and<br />\nsee if it will holler. It is calling for the nurse girl. Shove it into long<br />\ntrousers, place it tenderly in a basket, and send the remains home to dear Papa.<br />\n<br />\n\"IN MEMORIAM.\"<br />\nOh, why will the fortune of life play such pranks?<br />\nAnd why will it out down the young and the brave?<br />\nThe arch-fiend has busied himself in our ranks,<br />\nAnd carried one off like a dastardly knave.<br />\nHad he come, as of yore, with armor and shield,<br />\nA warrior tried, seasoned, bearded and gray,<br />\nWe had fought him and conquered, and forced him to yield<br />\nFor to win every battle is naughty-two's way.<br />\nBut he came as an infant all naked and bare,<br />\nDeserted, alone, in the mystery of night.<br />\nWe clothed him and fondled him, gave him our care,<br />\nThen why should ho harm us? Oh, say was it right?<br />\nFull of treachery and guile with intent to deceive,<br />\nHe fixed upon one of us innocent youths,<br />\nWhispered tales in his ear, that made Law believe,<br />\nAnd made terrible lies, seem like beautiful truths.<br />\nOh, he carried Law off to the false land of dreams,<br />\nDeceived by a kiss so subtle and sly,<br />\nAnd now in my sleep I hear pitiful screams;<br />\nOur poor comrade tortured, and none of us by.<br />\nOh, Law, fare thee well, thou art gone from us now.<br />\nForever and aye to thy destiny tied,<br />\nWe will grieve, and in prayer our knee lightly bow;<br />\nAnd mourn for a comrade who lately has died.<br />\n\u2014F. L. G-. '02.<br />\n<br />\nNEW UNIVERSITY SONGS.<br />\n<br />\n4T<br />\n4j HAS seemed strange to many people outside of the University that the<br />\nHopkins has so few college songs. Some persons have even hinted that<br />\nthe reason for this was a lack of true college spirit. This explanation,<br />\nhowever, is most decidedly erroneous, for to those who have looked into the<br />\nmatter at all it is evident that the true reason could more surely be found in<br />\nthe fact that never before has the attention of the student body been drawn to<br />\nthe subject of college songs.<br />\n\"To this end the musical organizations have determined to open a prize<br />\ncompetition for the best words, set either to original or popular music. Of<br />\ncourse, if a song with original words and music is handed in, it will be given<br />\n<br />\n\fTHE NEWS\u2014LETTER.<br />\n<br />\n15<br />\n<br />\npreference to verses alone\u2014yet if the words are set to some air which can be<br />\nused in the Glee Club or on the athletic grounds, provided neither \"Dixie\" nor<br />\nGeorgia\" is used, it will stand nearly as good a chance of taking a prize as<br />\nthe song with original music.<br />\n\"Three prizes have been offered\u2014the first of $10.00, the second of $5.00,<br />\nand the third of $3.00. The Judges will be Dr. Herbert E. Green and Messrs.<br />\nE. L. Turnbull, J A. E. Eyster, E. Smith and H. Eager. The prizes will be<br />\ndecided by the vote of these men.<br />\n\"It is hoped that every man at present in the University and those formerly<br />\nconnected with it will take part in this contest, either from a desire to win a<br />\nPrize, or from his love for his Alma Mater, or\u2014better yet\u2014from a happy combination of both these incentives.\"<br />\nThe above announcement was published in the May issue of the NEWSLETTER, and the competition was to have closed in June. But, after some<br />\nconsideration, it was decided by those who had charge of the matter to postpone the final decision till the first of November.<br />\nBy this change more men were given an opportunity to compete; and there<br />\nwas a greater chance of composing and writing some really good songs.<br />\nIf a sufficient number of songs are handed in, the committee will have<br />\nthem published in book form, and thus give to the University the first book of<br />\nentirely original Hopkins songs.<br />\nSurely, with such a result to crown his efforts, every student who can make<br />\nthe slightest attempt at poetry should enter the competition, for not only will<br />\nhe be aiding his college, but he may incidentally win an enviable reputation<br />\nand a little cheering' reward.<br />\n\"TROUSERS.\"<br />\nA Very Short Performance.<br />\nPLACE: University P. 0.

Beneath our feet the fragrant, slippery needles make us fearful of mishap. For ten remembered days<br />\nten loyal sons of Hopkins dwelt amid this \"solitude of pines with soft brown<br />\nSilences carpeted.\"<br /><br />\n(1.3'<br /><br />\n\"Yet not for all this beauty would I seek<br />\nThis lovely vale, but for more glorious things;<br />\nThere shines the sun that shall go down no more;<br />\nThere flows the fountain that shall water earth;<br />\nThere bursts the glory that shall never pale ;<br />\nThere springs the life with which death strives in vain;<br />\nThere are the golden chains prepared and forged<br />\nWhich knit our earth to heaven; there also stands<br />\nThe more than golden ladder which connects<br />\nThose lower chambers with the upper halls.\"<br /><br />\nAttractive as is the natural beauty of the place, the motive of the seven<br />\nhundred college men who gathered there this summer, not only in the camp but<br />\nin the less attractive dormitories of the Seminary, was rather the hope of spiritual awakening, to which the very beauty of the place itself conduces.<br />\nAt this Sixteenth Annual Conference, twenty-nine different nationalities<br />\nwere represented, and one hundred and forty-nine institutions of learning.<br />\nYale as usual led in attendance (120), with Princeton second. Hopkins was<br />\none of twelve colleges having nine or more delegates presentThe spiritual impressions were made at platform meetings, in the morning<br />\nand at night on each day by thirty-eight speakers of renown. The first few<br />\ndais were especially marked by the addresses of Mr. Morgan, as were the clos-<br /><br />\n2<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br /><br />\ning days by those of Mr. Robert Speer. To conserve and deepen these impressions, Bible classes, a Missionary Institute, and other departments were led by<br />\ncompetent men, among whom were Profs Bosworth and King of Oberlin, and<br />\nSanders of Yale. As there were present twenty-eight foreign delegates, the<br />\nmissionary interest was very strong, and Hopkins should rejoice to know that<br />\ntwo of her ten men volunteered for the foreign field while there.<br />\nAwakened amid the twitter of the early birds by the pulling of your cot<br />\nfrom beneath your weary bones, you bathe your sleepy eyes in mountain dew<br />\nstolen from your neighbor's pail, and are hardly through with your lavations<br />\nbefore the clang of a high-sounding cymbal calls you to the morning \"hashhouse\" meal (if it be not some mischievous chap abusing his wash-basin.)<br />\nAbout you at the table are many men of many minds from many colleges, in<br />\nmany stages of attire, calling lustily for the \"pump\" or the \"cow'S\u2014as their<br />\ntaste or rather thirst may dictate.<br />\nA missionary institute at eight, or a Bible class at nine, calls you across<br />\nfields<br />\ntenanted with bleating sheep to the group of Seminary buildings not<br />\nthe<br />\nfar away. At ten in the large Auditorium you hear such addresses by the very<br />\nforemost religious thinkers as are seldom offered elsewhere. Back to camp for<br />\ndinner, you have the afternoon for personal talks with the leading men of the<br />\nconference, or for sport. If the latter, perhaps today it is a plunge into the<br />\ncool waters of the nearby Connecticut just as Nature made you, tomorrow a<br />\ntramp through the three adjoining states of Vermont, New Hampshire and<br />\nMassachusetts, or perhaps a long drive, with the rest of your delegation, amid<br />\nthe beautiful hills with which the region abounds, and from which vistas of<br />\nnatural beauty present pictures that still linger in your mind. Yet within<br />\nthe Seminary grounds are found abundant opportunities for athletic endeavor.<br />\nRegular match games of base-ball are scheduled between teams of the attending colleges, a tennis tournament, with singles and doubles, a golf tournament,<br />\nand on ,the Fourth of July a special field day. This year Yale won the chain<br />\npionship in these events; R. H. Schauffler of Princeton defeated Ludington of<br />\nYale in a closely contested tennis tournament. These two colleges also played<br />\nthe finals for the baseball championship, Yale winning by a score of ten to<br />\nseven. As yet Hopkins has had no part in these games, but as she is gradually<br />\ncoming into more prominence in other lines, it, behooves the athletic element<br />\namong us to look out for Hopkins' honors in that direction also.<br />\nAt sunset the Conference gathers on 'Round Top\" where rests the body<br />\nof Mr. Moody, and \"Life-work Talks\" are given by men prominent in the different professions. These are perhaps the most stirring addresses in the ten<br />\ndays' program. From \"Round Top\" across the hills to the Auditorium for<br />\nthe platform meeting of the evening, you go amid the glories of a Northfield<br />\nsunset. There below is the calm, green valley, beautiful in its stillness, with<br />\nits meadows, its clustering houses and trees, the shining river curving through<br />\nthe midst, and beyond, the best of all, the everlasting hills with their constantly<br />\nchanging lights and shadows. Presently twilight falls and soon a hundred<br />\nlights from \"Hermon's wooded hill\" flash out, and nearby the Seminary lights<br />\nare also gleaming.<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS\u2014LETTER.<br /><br />\n3<br /><br />\nAt 9.30 you wend your way to the camp guided by the moon's soft rays,<br />\nand there, in the quiet second thought following the evening's address, are held<br />\nDelegation Meetings,\" in which the fellows come to know each other as never<br />\nbefore. Then to peaceful slumbers amid the stately pines\u2014provided no \"rough<br />\nhouse\" is on foot to disturb the wee hours of the morn.<br />\nFourth of July night is a gala occasion never forgotten by those participating. The large Auditorium is profusely decorated with college and state colors,<br />\na certain pro rata space being assigned te each college. Lockstep marching to<br />\ncollege tunes prevails all over the house for half an hour, and then after an ad\u2022<br />\ndress by Pres. Seth Low on \"The Responsibilities of the College Man to the<br />\nState,\" each delegation has an opportunity to give its yell, sing a song, if large<br />\nenough, do any \"stunt\" of special attraction that can be devised. In this Hopkins is in the van; \"the hit\" of the evening being that arranged for the \"Medical Schools of Baltimore.\" A skeleton specially devised and sheeted with skull,<br />\narm, and foot distinctly visible, previously concealed behind the platform suddenly rushes out over the heads of the astonished multitude during the singing<br />\nof our song, along the supporting ropes reaching to the vaulted roof float the<br />\nbanners of the different medical schools of Baltimore.<br />\nThe responses of the foreign delegates form a chief feature of the evening,<br />\nespecially those of the dozen Japanese students, whose singing(?) rivals that of<br />\nthe Hopkins Glee Club. The jolly times with these foreign delegates when they<br />\nvisited the camp will be long remembered. Pastor Hoffman, of Geneva, who<br />\nStyled himself \"The Veldt's Committee,\" a chief justice of Hungary, a native<br />\nlawyer from Labore, and many others of exceedingly attractive personality<br />\nmingled with delightful and helpful freedom among the fellows at our camp.<br />\nOne event worth special mention was the large reception given the entire<br />\nconference by the Yale delegation in East Hall. Another was the \"night shirt<br />\nbrigade\" which arose, like the mushroon, to full strength in a single night.<br />\nStarted by only a handful at the top of the hill in the dead of night, not twenty<br />\nminutes passed before every man in camp had either arisen in response to the<br />\ncall \"everybody out\" or had suffered his cot to depart from under him, and his<br />\nbedclothes to be scattered to the wind.<br />\nA hundred and twenty fellows in pajamas sitting on the top rail of a worm<br />\nfence at one thirty a. m., singing \"Good Night Ladies\" was certainly worthy<br />\nof a flashlight and further investigation.<br />\nTime and space would fail to tell of what we did; all that ten loyal Hopkinsians could devise was done. Is not that enough?<br />\nThose in the delegation, which was the same size as last year, were Dr. P.<br />\nS. Evans, Jr., Med., C. K. Edmunds,'97, A. W. Freeman, G. S., R. L. McAll,<br />\n'00, A.

We have deemed it ad-<br /><br />\nt<br /><br />\nvisable to adopt the present shape for several reasons, the most important<br />\nof which is that we believe our readers will find the present magazine<br />\nform more desirable and less inconvenient to handle than the old design. In<br />\nthe course of the ensuing year the NEWS-LETTER desires to come into close<br />\ntouch with every student of the University, and in order to accomplish this<br />\nevery effort will be made to publish such news as will interest all Hopkins<br />\nstudents. With this end in view we propose to extend our field to the Medical<br />\nSchool, to devote a portion of each issue to Medical School items, and to supplement our present staff of editors by the addition of a Medical School Editor.<br />\nWith the exception of the \"Hullabaloo,\" the NEWS-LETTER is the only<br />\nstudent publication at Hopkins, and for this reason we wish every student to<br />\ntake a personal interest in the paper. It is yours, support it, encourage it, improve it by helpful criticism given in proper spirit, and in return it will endeavor<br />\nto give you a representative college journal.<br />\nURING the past five months misfortune has dealt us several cruel blows.<br />\nNever before in the history of the University has death claimed so many<br />\nof our Faculty in so brief a period of time. Just before the university<br />\nclosed last spring, the whole scientific world was called upon to mourn with us<br />\nthe loss of one its greatest thinkers and inventors\u2014Professor Rowland.<br />\nAs we commence our 26th academic year we find three distinguished names<br />\nmissing from our Faculty roll\u2014Dr. Herbert B. Adams, Professor Emeritus of<br />\nAmerican an? Institutional History; Dr. Sidney Sherwood, Associate Professor<br /><br />\ng<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS\u2014LETTER. -<br /><br />\n5<br /><br />\nin Political Economy, and Dr. Morris C. Sutphen, Instructor in Latin. The<br />\nloss to an institution, of four such men cannot be estimated, it can, however,<br />\nbe felt\u2014felt most deeply.<br /><br />\nt<br /><br />\nHE halls of old Johns Hopkins are open for another academic year, and<br />\nanother class, untutored and untrained along the lines of University<br />\nthought and action has entered.<br />\nTo the'class, known in the college world as Freshinan, the NEWS-LETTIM<br />\nextends its greeting and a bit of advice. Remember, first of all, that you are<br />\nnow an integral part of a great University, and the position carries with it a<br />\ncertain amount of responsibility; your alma mater is beginning a great work for<br />\nYOU; in return you owe her something, nor is this duty entirely absolved by<br />\nfaithful and constant effort in class work, for apart from the high standard of<br />\nscholarship necessary in order to be a Hopkins student, there are certain other<br />\nresponsibilities devolving upon you. The first of these is unswerving loyalty<br />\nto the Black and Blue, a loyalty stronger and deeper than a mere preparatory<br />\nschool affiliation, a loyalty which, despite storm and tempest, will never be<br />\nShaken, Perhaps you have some latent talent, beside your natural inclination (?)<br />\nto study. If such be the case now is the time to bring it forth. The students<br />\nmaintain athletic teams, musical clubs, and two publications. If athletically<br />\ninclined try for a place on the foot ball, lacrosse, or track and field team; if<br />\nmusic proves the greater charm there are Glee, Banjo and Mandolin Clubs; if<br />\nYou have a bent for the literary side there is the NEWS-LETTER. Last of all,<br />\nbut by no means least, there is your support which all three of the above named<br />\ndepartments of undergraduate effort need and solicit. Other classes have lived<br />\nUp to expectations, shown college spirit, supported college institutions\u2014now<br />\nlireshmen \"go and do likewise.\"<br /><br />\nG<br /><br />\nACH year we notice the increasing tendency among American colleges to<br />\nemulate the example of the Johns Hopkins University in two important<br />\nrespects, the first of which is to reduce from four to three years the course<br />\nof study leading to the degree of Bachelor of Arts, and second to require an A.<br />\nB. from students wishing to take up the study of medicine. Within the past<br />\ntwo years the University of Pennsylvania has adopted the latter course, and<br />\nseveral other medical universities now announce the same policy. Beyond<br />\nquestion this is excellent policy. A man taking up medicine as a profession<br />\nShould have something more than a mere elementary knowledge of the first<br />\nPrinciples of education. Yet many medical schools admit men who have not<br />\nCompleted their public school course. As a consequence the finished products<br />\nturned out\" by the institutions of medicine are not of a finished nature. On<br />\nthe other hand it is advisable to reduce the length of the under-graduate course<br />\nand place an A. B. within reach of a man after a period of three instead of four<br />\nYears work. The extra year thus gained means a great deal to many a young<br />\nman who enters the field of medicine, law, or any kindred science requiring a<br />\nSpecial course. At the same time he may feel that he is in no sense a loser, for<br /><br />\n6<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS\u2014LETTER.<br /><br />\nthe three year curriculum of to-day embraces as much as the four year curriculum of twenty or thirty years ago. More attention is paid to the practical side<br />\nof knowledge, and effort is made to school the college man of to-day in those<br />\nstudies which will be of the greatest use to him in after life. Even to the man<br />\nwho contemplates entering business at the expiration of his undergraduate<br />\ncourse, the three year curriculum will be of advantage, for as the term of college<br />\nlife is shortened every effort will be made to conform the course to the<br />\nstudent's needs,concentrating his energies upon the most useful subjects for his<br />\nbranch of work, and eliminating those which will be of little advantage to him.<br />\nFinally, in an age of hurry, of stimulated energy, and gigantic enterprise, an<br />\nage in which every hour is of importance and value to a man entering a business career, a young man is given the advantage of another year, and thus<br />\nenabled to begin the struggle for existence one year sooner.<br />\nHE Hopkins foot ball season has opened under the most auspicious<br />\ncircumstances. It is true our team has been somewhat crippled by the<br />\nloss of several of last year's best players. Still, judging from the<br />\namount of interest and enthusiasm manifested by the students, and particularly<br />\nthe students of the Medical School, it is probable that this year's team will be<br />\none of the best Hopkins has ever put upon the field. The securing of a firstclass coach is an innovation, the advantages of which cannot be too strongly<br />\nemphasized. In securing Mr. Dickson of University of Pennsylvania, the<br />\nUniversity has taken a step in the right direction, the significance of which will<br />\nbe better appreciated when the foot ball season is more advanced. Through<br />\nthe generosity of the musical clubs in so kindly donating one hundred dollars,<br />\nthe foot ball team will start a training table.<br />\nIn order that the entire student body may have an opportunity to witness<br />\nthe games this fall, the management has decided to issue season tickets, admitting to five games, for one dollar and a half, thus selling admissions to five<br />\ngames for the price of three.<br /><br />\nZ<br /><br />\nFACULTY VACATIONS.<br />\nR. REMSEN spent a very profitable and refreshing summer in New England. He began with a walking trip through the Berkshire Hills, Massachusetts, as was his habit when a professor at Williams College.<br />\nAfterwards he was at Springfield, Massachusetts, and Northeast Harbor, Maine,<br />\nbeing at the latter place a next door neighbor of Dr. Gilman. Besides this outdoor activity, Dr. Remsen employed his leisure in preparing for the printer<br />\nanother of his series of chemistry text-books.<br />\nDr. Osier, Hopkins professor of medicine, traveled during the summer<br />\nmonths in England and on the Continent, taking time to attend the London<br />\nTuberculosis Congress. Dr. Osler says great physicians no longer think much<br />\nof drugs in the treatment of this disease. It is now regarded as contagious,<br />\nand the best treatment is considered to consist in the proper inspection, sanitation, and other hygienic measures.<br /><br />\n9<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS\u2014LETTER.<br /><br />\n11<br /><br />\nATHLETICS.<br />\n41<br /><br />\nFOOT BALL SCHEDULE.

U. vs. U. of M.. at American League Park.<br /><br />\nOUTLOOK FOR COMING SEASON.<br />\nT IS always the case at the opening of the scholastic year at the Hopkins<br />\nthat the Athletic outlook is of anything but brightest hue, and the year<br />\njust started has but little more prospect than former ones. In all branches<br />\nmen have been lost,\u2014some by graduation, some by \"quituation,\" and still<br />\nothers have been compelled to forego all sports for the sake of their University<br />\nwork.<br />\nIn football, in track and field work, and in lacrosse heavy losses have been<br />\nsustained. The foot ball team has lost such men as Hancock, Butler, Morse,<br />\nSchmitters, Meadows, Bruton, Riggs, and others who aided us to victory last<br />\nYear. To he sure, their places in part have been filled by the acquisition of new<br />\nmen from the freshmen ranks and the further developement of such stand-bys as<br />\nBlanck, Straus, Yearley and Sayler; but the whipping into shape of the new<br />\nmen gives the team a hard handicap to overcome.<br />\nThe track team has lost Whitman, the man who could sprint, and who<br />\ncould equally well put the shot. Riggs refuses to enter athletics again, saying<br />\nthat his work at the medical school has become of such a nature that he can not<br />\nafford to slight it \"at this stage of the game.\" Others, too, have gone whose<br />\naid in winning victories for the Black and Blue will be sorely missed. But<br />\nmany of the old men have returned who will furnish the bone and sinew for the<br />\nteam, and, no doubt, will get together a team worthy of the University.<br />\nThe lacrosse squad has been diminished by the graduation of Bruton,<br />\nBandel, and Tyler from the collegiate department, and of Maddren from the<br />\nMedical School. Maddren's loss will be most keenly felt, for aside from playing the game in a masterly fashion, he knew all its fine points, and has for a<br />\ncouple of years acted as head coach for our team. Abercrombie, Briscoe, and<br />\nB. M. Bernheim are at the Medical School, and the remainder of the team is<br />\nstill in the undergraduate department. The loss in number does not appear<br />\nespecially great, but when the ability of the men is taken into consideration the<br />\nheavy loss can be appreciated.<br />\nThe incoming class seems very enthusiastic over all sorts of sports, so we<br />\ndo not think that there can he much doubt as to the superiority of our teams for<br /><br />\n5<br /><br />\n4<br /><br />\n12<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS\u2014LETTER.<br /><br />\nthe coming year. But let us impress upon all the necessity of all turning out.<br />\n\"No,\" we hear you say, \"what's the use of my trying to do anything. I am<br />\nworthless, so why should I go to the trouble of 'turning out.'\" No, my friend,<br />\nyou are not \"worthless.\" Come out and show your spirit, and do your best,<br />\nsomething will happen. Some of the best athletes ever produced at this Uni versity were men like you. They had to be coaxed to come out. They thought<br />\nthemselves \"good for nothing,\" but when they got under the care of a trainer,<br />\nthey developed, and showed such magnificent qualities that they really surprised<br />\nthemselves<br />\nSo, young man, come out, and do your level best for her whom we all love\u2014<br />\nour Alma Mater.<br />\nPROSPECT FOR FOOT BALL.<br />\nUST at present Foot Ball is the engrossing topic. This year Hopkins has<br />\ntwo entirely new features to boast of, viz.: a coach and a training table.<br />\nMr. Dickson, of the U. of P., will handle the men during the season, and<br />\nexpresses the opinion that a winning team will do the honors for Old Tom<br />\nHopkins on the gridiron. The team will, no doubt, be lighter than last year's,<br />\naveraging not over 150 lbs., but this feature will be supplemented by speed and<br />\nconcerted team work. There's lots of new material this year and some of it<br />\nappears to be very good, but we can make no prophecies just yet, as the task<br />\nof weeding out the team has not begun. All the candidates are, however, to<br />\nbe congratulated on their enthusiasm and interest as shown by the large<br />\n,numbers which are present for daily practice. There is a rumor afloat that<br />\nseveral Meds, besides those who have already shown up will join these swelling<br />\nranks of Black and Blue Warriors, and there is some splendid material in the<br />\nMedical School. The first game is with Rock Hill, at the American League<br />\nPark, Saturday, and we prophesy that Rock Hill will count her score with<br />\none oval figure. Season tickets will be sold this year at $1.50 for the entire<br />\nschedule of games to be played by J. H. U. in Baltimore, including all the<br />\nchampionship games, also the game with U. of Md. We add in conclusion:<br />\nEverybody out next Saturday, the rooting promises to be something fierce; woe<br />\nunto the freshman whose chubby face is not to be seen there.<br /><br />\n3<br /><br />\nTHE GALLERY.<br />\nMPROVEMENT is the mark of the age. Last year THE NEWS LETTER<br />\nseveral times called attention to changes being made in and around the<br />\nGymnasium building, and this year, for the first time is it noticed that<br />\naccommodations for visitors and onlookers in the cage are both sufficient and<br />\nconvenient. The gallery was spoken of two years ago and finally built during<br />\nthe last few weeks of last season. So far the gallery leads in the list of<br />\nimprovements to our athletic accommodations which began with the building<br />\nof the cage some few years ago and have continued ever since. Some day we<br />\nwill have a swimming pool, Thanks, Mack!<br /><br />\n3<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br /><br />\n.<br /><br />\n13<br /><br />\nNow that the gallery is ready for occupancy by interested spectators of<br />\nteam practice, would it be out of place to remind students and others that one<br />\nof the main purposes in building it was to save the running track? Formerly<br />\nthe track was at the mercy of all onlookers in the cage, and it required Mack's<br />\nbest efforts to keep it in any sort of condition for his men to train. Now we<br />\nShould all remember that the cage is for players, the track for runners and the<br />\ngallery for spectators.<br />\nOUR PHILIPPINE DEPARTMENT.<br />\nOHNS Hopkins is the first institution in the country to start a course of<br />\ninstruction in the dialects, manners and customs of our Eastern possessions. For some time past, the University ha been collecting the available<br />\nliterature concerning the habits and language of the Filipinos, and now the library contains practically all the books of any value on these subjects to be had<br />\nin this country. Dr. Haupt, head of the department of Semitic languages, will<br />\nhave immediate supervision of the work. The first course offered is an elective<br />\nin Tagalog, given by Mr. F. R. Blake, formerly a fellow of the University. Mr.<br />\nBlake has specialized in Sanskrit and in the Semitic languages. As the Malay<br />\ndialects are mixtures of Sanskrit and Arabic, he is especially well qualified for<br />\nthe work. Since all the valuable works on this subject are in Spanish or German, Mr. Blake is preparing an English manual of the dialects used on the<br />\nislands, designed both for students and for general use.<br />\nIt is hard to overestimate the importance of this department, and the honor<br />\naccruing to the Hopkins for its enterprise in founding it. In Dr. Haupt's words,<br />\nconcerning the great Sepoy rebellion, \"if the English authorities had consulted<br />\nanybody familiar with the prejudices of the natives, they would never have<br />\ncompelled the use of those bullets greased with the fat that was an abomination<br />\nto Hindoo and Mohommedan alike. The U. S. Bureau of Ethnology has<br />\nalready saved to the Government millions of dollars in its dealings with the<br />\nIndians.\" From this is seen the necessity to our country, soon to be a power<br />\nin the Orient, of such courses and instructions.<br />\nDr. Haupt has also in view an encyclopedia of the industries, the economical, political, and religious life of the Philippines.

You may<br />\nwear Sister Maggie's dress skirts as kilts and carry along the baby's feeding<br />\napparatus. The malted milk drops and Mellin's Food Sandwiches must be<br />\ntaken each day for lunch. If you are punched in the mug, say \"goo, goo!'<br /><br />\n14<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS\u2014LETTER.<br /><br />\nbut don't run away. The Juniors love you, and will make you feel queer. So<br />\nbe happy.<br />\nLESSON IV.<br />\nWhose child is this? It looks around as if it were lost. It really seems to<br />\nhave lost the lower portion of its pantaloons. Hit it with an Indian club and<br />\nsee if it will holler. It is calling for the nurse girl. Shove it into long<br />\ntrousers, place it tenderly in a basket, and send the remains home to dear Papa.<br /><br />\n\"IN MEMORIAM.\"<br />\nOh, why will the fortune of life play such pranks?<br />\nAnd why will it out down the young and the brave?<br />\nThe arch-fiend has busied himself in our ranks,<br />\nAnd carried one off like a dastardly knave.<br />\nHad he come, as of yore, with armor and shield,<br />\nA warrior tried, seasoned, bearded and gray,<br />\nWe had fought him and conquered, and forced him to yield<br />\nFor to win every battle is naughty-two's way.<br />\nBut he came as an infant all naked and bare,<br />\nDeserted, alone, in the mystery of night.<br />\nWe clothed him and fondled him, gave him our care,<br />\nThen why should ho harm us? Oh, say was it right?<br />\nFull of treachery and guile with intent to deceive,<br />\nHe fixed upon one of us innocent youths,<br />\nWhispered tales in his ear, that made Law believe,<br />\nAnd made terrible lies, seem like beautiful truths.<br />\nOh, he carried Law off to the false land of dreams,<br />\nDeceived by a kiss so subtle and sly,<br />\nAnd now in my sleep I hear pitiful screams;<br />\nOur poor comrade tortured, and none of us by.<br />\nOh, Law, fare thee well, thou art gone from us now.<br />\nForever and aye to thy destiny tied,<br />\nWe will grieve, and in prayer our knee lightly bow;<br />\nAnd mourn for a comrade who lately has died.<br />\n\u2014F. L. G-. '02.<br /><br />\nNEW UNIVERSITY SONGS.<br /><br />\n4T<br />\n4j HAS seemed strange to many people outside of the University that the<br />\nHopkins has so few college songs. Some persons have even hinted that<br />\nthe reason for this was a lack of true college spirit. This explanation,<br />\nhowever, is most decidedly erroneous, for to those who have looked into the<br />\nmatter at all it is evident that the true reason could more surely be found in<br />\nthe fact that never before has the attention of the student body been drawn to<br />\nthe subject of college songs.<br />\n\"To this end the musical organizations have determined to open a prize<br />\ncompetition for the best words, set either to original or popular music. Of<br />\ncourse, if a song with original words and music is handed in, it will be given<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS\u2014LETTER.<br /><br />\n15<br /><br />\npreference to verses alone\u2014yet if the words are set to some air which can be<br />\nused in the Glee Club or on the athletic grounds, provided neither \"Dixie\" nor<br />\nGeorgia\" is used, it will stand nearly as good a chance of taking a prize as<br />\nthe song with original music.<br />\n\"Three prizes have been offered\u2014the first of $10.00, the second of $5.00,<br />\nand the third of $3.00. The Judges will be Dr. Herbert E. Green and Messrs.<br />\nE. L. Turnbull, J A. E. Eyster, E. Smith and H. Eager. The prizes will be<br />\ndecided by the vote of these men.<br />\n\"It is hoped that every man at present in the University and those formerly<br />\nconnected with it will take part in this contest, either from a desire to win a<br />\nPrize, or from his love for his Alma Mater, or\u2014better yet\u2014from a happy combination of both these incentives.\"<br />\nThe above announcement was published in the May issue of the NEWSLETTER, and the competition was to have closed in June. But, after some<br />\nconsideration, it was decided by those who had charge of the matter to postpone the final decision till the first of November.<br />\nBy this change more men were given an opportunity to compete; and there<br />\nwas a greater chance of composing and writing some really good songs.<br />\nIf a sufficient number of songs are handed in, the committee will have<br />\nthem published in book form, and thus give to the University the first book of<br />\nentirely original Hopkins songs.<br />\nSurely, with such a result to crown his efforts, every student who can make<br />\nthe slightest attempt at poetry should enter the competition, for not only will<br />\nhe be aiding his college, but he may incidentally win an enviable reputation<br />\nand a little cheering' reward.<br />\n\"TROUSERS.\"<br />\nA Very Short Performance.<br />\nPLACE: University P. 0.
