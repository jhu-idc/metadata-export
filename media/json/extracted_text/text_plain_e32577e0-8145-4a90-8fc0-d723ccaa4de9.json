Smith<br />\n<br />\nVox Populi<br />\nOn several occasions in the past the News-Letter has<br />\nadvocated the opening of Honor Commission administrative and policy meetings to the press as well as the individual student. In the main it has done this quietly<br />\nand without excessive publitity and in each case has met<br />\nwith utter failure.<br />\nAt this moment the student has no idea what plans,<br />\nif any, the Commission is considering as possible amendmentS to the present Code or as changes in the policy of<br />\nthe entire Honor System. There is no reasonable advantage for this secrecy.' Quite to the contrary, given the<br />\nfar-reaching effects that an Honor Commission decision<br />\ncan have on an individual student, and given the theory<br />\nthat the Code is self-imposed by the student, there should<br />\nbe adequate means for the dissemination of information<br />\non policy, discussions and proposals which now are carried<br />\non behind closed doors.<br />\nIt is a contractual right of every student to know<br />\nnot only the final refined product of Commission meetings, but also the reasons and arguments which led to it.<br />\nThe student should know so that he may discuss<br />\nwith a degree of intelligence the possible ramifications of<br />\nthe proposals. One may raise the objection that he has<br />\nthis power now, given the plebisite necessary for ratification. This is true, but now-he has no way of taking part<br />\nin the refining process.<br />\nInformed public opinion and debate will exert a positive influence on the proceedings of the Commission and<br />\nwill give that body a broader base for its decisions, and<br />\nwill give the student more than a \"yes or no\" alternative<br />\nat the polls.<br />\nOur opponents may argue that open meetings would<br />\nlead to a cumbersome and, therefore, weak Honor System.<br />\nHowever, if it can be proven not cumbersome the 'threat<br />\nof weakness can be dismissed. If the Commission would<br />\nonly allow outside injection under prescribed rules, the<br />\nweakness of cumbersomeness would be absolved while<br />\nmaintaining the students right to know and to effect<br />\npolicy through formation of public opinion.<br />\n<br />\nIFB Obligations<br />\nAlthough the IFB has survived the rush season with<br />\napparently little dirty ,rushing\u2014a few minor, violations<br />\nwere unreported, a lesser number of major violations were<br />\nignored, and one major violation was punished swiftly and<br />\nstringently\u2014and thus seems to have corrected its prior<br />\nineffectiveness and to have instituted a real binding power<br />\namong the member- fraternities, its problems are still<br />\nmany.<br />\nThe major problem, and one which, because it is<br />\nintangible and not susceptible of legislation, will be the<br />\nmost difficult to resolve, is that .of University-fraternity<br />\nrelationships,, a matter of attitude, a matter of the fraternities' failure to identify their problems with the University. Too frequently, fraternities are wont to maintain<br />\nthat their drinking, noise-making and rushing period and<br />\ntechniques have nothing to do with the University, when,<br />\nin fact, the University's reputation suffers from Greek<br />\nantics and the University's freshmen are subjected to too<br />\nmuch rushing pressure and anxiety at entirely the wrong<br />\ntime in their four years, the first four weeks (a period<br />\nof time which merely compounds the pressure and anxiety<br />\nof the previous six4eek rush period).<br />\nRules regulating the establishment of an attitude<br />\ncommensurate with the University's best interests and<br />\nwith the undefined and undefinable platitudes of the<br />\nGentleman's Code are futile, ridiculous and, indeed, totally<br />\nundesirable. But attitudes of identification with the University among fraternities are neither futile in their results, ridiculous in their conduct nor undesirable.<br />\nThe admission of ZBT; the seating of presidents in<br />\nthe IFB; the correction of the anxieties and pressures<br />\non freshmen devolving from a four-week rush period,<br />\nand the establishment of continuity in IFB membership<br />\nfrom one year to another are issues which the IFB is<br />\nobligated to consider and act wisely upon.

My<br />\nMorris chair,incidentally,was given to me by the makers of Philip<br />\n, Morris. They also gave me my Philip chair. They are greathearted folk, the makers of Philip Morris, as millions of you<br />\nknow who have enjoyed their excellent cigarettes.

For those who prefer to buy their cigarettes in bulk,<br />\nplease contact Emmett R. Sigafoos, friendly manager of our<br />\nfactory in Richmond, Virginia,<br />\nBut I digress. I was saying that in order to know the true<br />\nfacts about sorority rushing, one must go into the field and investigate. Consequently, I went last week to the Indiana<br />\nCollege of Spot Welding and Belles-Lettres and interviewed<br />\nseveral million coeds, among them a lovely lass named Gerund<br />\nMcKeever. (It is, incidentally, quite an interesting little story<br />\nabout how she came to be named Gerund.) It seems dip, her<br />\nfather, Ralph T. McKeever, loved grammar better than anything in the world, and so he named all his children after parts<br />\nof speech. In addition to Gerund, there were three girls named<br />\nPreposition, Adverb, and Pronoun, and one boy named Dative<br />\nCase. The girls seemed not to be unduly depressed by their<br />\nnames, but Dative Case, alas, grew steadily more morose and<br />\nwas finally found one night dangling from a participle. After<br />\nthis tragic\" event, the-father abandoned his practice of grammatical nomenclature, and whatever children were subsequently<br />\nborn to him\u2014eight in all\u2014were named Everett.<br />\n. But I digress. I was interviewing a lovely coed named<br />\nGerund NIcKeever. \"Gerund,\" I said, \"were you rushed by a<br />\nsorority?\"<br />\n\"Yes, mister,\" she said, \"I was rushed by a sorority.\" '<br />\n\"Did they give you a high-preSsure pitch?\" I asked. \"Did<br />\nthey use the hard sell?\"<br />\n\"No, mister,\" she replied. \"It was all done with quiet<br />\ndignity.

Smith<br /><br />\nVox Populi<br />\nOn several occasions in the past the News-Letter has<br />\nadvocated the opening of Honor Commission administrative and policy meetings to the press as well as the individual student. In the main it has done this quietly<br />\nand without excessive publitity and in each case has met<br />\nwith utter failure.<br />\nAt this moment the student has no idea what plans,<br />\nif any, the Commission is considering as possible amendmentS to the present Code or as changes in the policy of<br />\nthe entire Honor System. There is no reasonable advantage for this secrecy.' Quite to the contrary, given the<br />\nfar-reaching effects that an Honor Commission decision<br />\ncan have on an individual student, and given the theory<br />\nthat the Code is self-imposed by the student, there should<br />\nbe adequate means for the dissemination of information<br />\non policy, discussions and proposals which now are carried<br />\non behind closed doors.<br />\nIt is a contractual right of every student to know<br />\nnot only the final refined product of Commission meetings, but also the reasons and arguments which led to it.<br />\nThe student should know so that he may discuss<br />\nwith a degree of intelligence the possible ramifications of<br />\nthe proposals. One may raise the objection that he has<br />\nthis power now, given the plebisite necessary for ratification.

I was saying that in order to know the true<br />\nfacts about sorority rushing, one must go into the field and investigate. Consequently, I went last week to the Indiana<br />\nCollege of Spot Welding and Belles-Lettres and interviewed<br />\nseveral million coeds, among them a lovely lass named Gerund<br />\nMcKeever. (It is, incidentally, quite an interesting little story<br />\nabout how she came to be named Gerund.) It seems dip, her<br />\nfather, Ralph T. McKeever, loved grammar better than anything in the world, and so he named all his children after parts<br />\nof speech. In addition to Gerund, there were three girls named<br />\nPreposition, Adverb, and Pronoun, and one boy named Dative<br />\nCase. The girls seemed not to be unduly depressed by their<br />\nnames, but Dative Case, alas, grew steadily more morose and<br />\nwas finally found one night dangling from a participle. After<br />\nthis tragic\" event, the-father abandoned his practice of grammatical nomenclature, and whatever children were subsequently<br />\nborn to him\u2014eight in all\u2014were named Everett.<br />\n. But I digress. I was interviewing a lovely coed named<br />\nGerund NIcKeever. \"Gerund,\" I said, \"were you rushed by a<br />\nsorority?\"<br />\n\"Yes, mister,\" she said, \"I was rushed by a sorority.\" '<br />\n\"Did they give you a high-preSsure pitch?\" I asked. \"Did<br />\nthey use the hard sell?\"<br />\n\"No, mister,\" she replied. \"It was all done with quiet<br />\ndignity.
