Since that time, the<br />\nletter has been read publicly and revealed to<br />\nmany of its author's colleagues.<br />\nNo Publicity<br />\nThe professor who wrote the letter strongly<br />\noPPosed any publicity over it and the reaction<br />\nto it. His name, not revealed at the public<br />\nreading of the letter at the Tuesday teach-in, will<br />\nremain unrevealed until next week at the<br />\nearliest.<br />\nThe letter stated that the professor was<br />\nprofoundly troubled\" by recent events on<br />\nOther campuses. A disagreement with a student<br />\nover a moral issue, stated the letter, would not<br />\naffect that student's grades within the<br />\ndepartment. However, the letter continued,\"My<br />\n\u00b0Pinion of an indivual's respect for the nature of<br />\nan academic community is, I am bound to say,<br />\n\u00b0Re of the most important of my opinions<br />\nregarding him as a teacher.\"<br />\nThe professor declined to comment on any<br />\nPart of the letter's contents or on any reactions<br />\n<br />\nhe had received to it. He resents the fact that a<br />\nhe<br />\nwhich<br />\nconsidered<br />\nletter<br />\nprivate<br />\ncorrespondence has made its way into the news.<br />\nAlthough the letter was sent to every graduate<br />\nstudent in the department, the professor noted<br />\nthat he had used his personal stationery and<br />\nrefrained from any mention of the department<br />\nor the university.<br />\nStifled Opinion<br />\nThe letter has drawn angry response from<br />\nseveral graduate students in the department.<br />\nHowever, they are not prepared to affix their<br />\nnames to any criticism of the professor,<br />\nconsidering the influence which his opinion may<br />\nhave over their professional careers.<br />\nAt the teach-in and rally Tuesday, the letter<br />\nwas read aloud by Dr. John S. Mann, Professor<br />\nof Education. Dr. Mann stressed that those<br />\npresent should draw their own conclusions from.<br />\nthe text of the letter, in contrast to an SDS<br />\nmember who presented it as a \"Piece of<br />\nacademic blackmail,\"<br />\nAfter reading the letter, Dr. Mann added \"as a<br />\nmember of the Johns Hopkins faculty, I am<br />\nprofoundly ashamed of this letter.\" He<br />\ncontinued, saying \"I will not reveal who wrote<br />\nthis letter, but I urge him to come forth and<br />\njustify this to his students and to the entire<br />\ncommunity.\"<br />\nThe graduate students of the Philosophy<br />\nDepartment intend to meet today to discuss the<br />\nletter and get clarification on delicate points<br />\nfrom its author. The consensus of the graduate<br />\nstudents who were interviewed by the<br />\nNews-Letter was that the letter was ambiguous.<br />\nThe matter was so complex, they contended,<br />\nthat \"a few anonymous quotes won't reveal the<br />\nfeeling in the Department.\"<br />\n<br />\nMany of the letter's critics refer to it .as an'<br />\nattempt to coerce the students into a certain<br />\nposition on moral issues. If this is the case, they<br />\ncontend, the author of the letter has exceeded<br />\nhis rights and academic prerogatives.<br />\nHowever, many make it clear that this is not<br />\nan isolated case. According to Dr. Stephen<br />\nAmbrose, Professor of History, there have b9en<br />\nmany such cases as this in the last five years. In<br />\nmost of these cases, however, knowledge of the<br />\nattempt to sway moral stands or opinions has<br />\nnever left the confines of the department.<br />\n<br />\nDR STEVEN MANN is reading the letter of an unindentified<br />\nPic by Lemm<br />\nfaculty member at last Tuesday's teach-in.<br />\n<br />\nMandel Signs ConstitutiDnally Dubious Drug Bill<br />\nBy DAVE MELAMED<br />\n<br />\nGOVERNOR MARVIN MANDEL appears uncertain about his<br />\nstand on illegal drugs.<br />\n<br />\nA bill which provides for incarceration for<br />\n\"unspecified periods\" up to seven years of<br />\nany person exhibiting the symptoms of \"physical<br />\nand psychological dependence\" on any illegal<br />\ndrug was signed into law last week by Governor<br />\nMarvin Mandel.<br />\nEntitled the \"Comprehensive Drug Abuse<br />\nControl and Rehabilitation Act,\" the law<br />\nempowers parents, relatives, \"or anyone residing<br />\nin the same house of an alleged addict\" to<br />\n\"apply for an order certifying such person to the<br />\ncare and custody of authority.\"<br />\nOnce such application has been made, a court<br />\norder issued under the new law shall \"direct the<br />\nalleged drug addict to appear at a specified time<br />\nbefore the court for a determination whether<br />\nthere are reasonable grounds to order him to<br />\nundergo a medical examiniation at a facility<br />\ndesignated by the authority.\"<br />\nA Warrant<br />\n\"If the alleged drug addict does not comply<br />\nwith such order, the court shall issue A<br />\nWARRANT and shall direct any peace officer or<br />\npolice officer in the State to take the alleged<br />\ndrug addict into custody,\" states section 9 (B)<br />\n(4) of the law.<br />\n<br />\nMandel's action came just three weeks before<br />\na blue-ribbon gubernatorial commission on drugs<br />\nwas due to release its findings.

The classified work on<br />\nthe Air Force project has been<br />\ndecreasing slowly over the past years,<br />\nKimball asserted, but he was unsure<br />\nwhether a future renewal will be granted<br />\nto the classified Barton Laboratories.<br />\nThe overwhelming majority of grants<br />\nand contracts have been sponsored<br />\nthrough the Department of Health,<br />\nEducation and Welfare. The medical<br />\nschools, chemistry, biology and other<br />\nHopkins departments received over<br />\n$29.5 million from HEW. The<br />\nDepartment of Defense was second,<br />\n\u2014 contracting out $3.4 million worth of<br />\nresearch to the University followed by<br />\n$2.4 million from the National Science<br />\nFoundation.<br />\nThe officer for sponsored research on<br />\nthe Homewood campus, Donald<br />\nMcLeod, said, on an inquiry if the<br />\nresearch for DOD was related to the war<br />\neffort,that \"anything you do can be<br />\nremotely tied to weaponry.\" He<br />\nexplained', though, that research<br />\nconsidered to be related to defense<br />\nwould usually be under the title of<br />\nclassified reseatch and must be dpproved<br />\nby an ad hoc faculty committee.<br />\nMulti-Step Process<br />\nDean Kimball said that the normal<br />\nprocedure for granting research projects<br />\nfor individual professors required<br />\napproval<br />\nfrom<br />\nthe<br />\nprofessor's<br />\ndepartment chairman, Kimball as Dean<br />\nof Arts and Sciences and the Institute of<br />\nSponsored Research. After that, the<br />\ncontractor will negotiate the details of<br />\nthe project directly with the ISR.<br />\nHowever, on classified contracts<br />\nKimball asserted that a faculty<br />\n<br />\ncommittee considered all proposals and<br />\nthe limitations they may impose on the<br />\nUniversity. In fact, though, he said, no<br />\nclassified research has been approved for<br />\na number of years.<br />\nthe<br />\nBesides<br />\ndown<br />\ncutting<br />\nbureaucratic tape, the establishment of<br />\nthe Institute of Sponsored Research<br />\ndesignated outside researchers required<br />\nfor a project under the titles of Research<br />\nScientist,Associate Research Scientist and<br />\nResearch Assisitant. All these posts deal<br />\nin research requiring no teaching<br />\nresponsibilities.<br />\nHowever, McLeod<br />\ncharacterized these posts as a sometimes<br />\na \"backdoor\" way to appoint a<br />\nresearcher to a tenured position as a<br />\nprofessor.<br />\nBackdoor Man<br />\nEspecially before the Institute lost its<br />\nold freedom from the administration,<br />\nMcLeod rememberd, a highly regarded<br />\nteaching<br />\nresearcher<br />\npoor<br />\nwith<br />\ncredentials could be enticed to Hopkins<br />\nby a lucrative research grant and then<br />\nthrough the \"backdoor\" of subsequent<br />\ngrants slowly placed in the position for<br />\na professorial position.<br />\nConcerning the Defense Department<br />\ngrants, all come through the divisions of<br />\nNavy, Army and Air Force. Three<br />\ndepartments listed as having many<br />\ncontracts with DOD last year were<br />\nBiology, Chemistry and Mechanics. Dr.<br />\nWilliam McElroy, the chairman of<br />\nBiology, said his department received<br />\nNavy contracts on basic research mainly<br />\nconcerned<br />\nwith<br />\nmarine biologY\u2022<br />\nMcElroy said no contracts dealt with<br />\ndefense<br />\nprojects. The Chemistry<br />\ndepartment head, Dr. Walter Koski, said<br />\nhis department dealt in Army contracts<br />\nof basic research. \"We have no applied<br />\nresearch or classified research,\" Koski<br />\nstated.<br />\nGrants vs. Contracts<br />\nMcLeod distinguished between grants<br />\nand contracts. Grants, he said, contain<br />\nno legal obligation that the project will<br />\nyield any tangible results. However, a<br />\ncontractual agreement requires that a<br />\nfirm product emerged from the research<br />\nconducted.<br />\nThe ISR officer said Hopkins has one<br />\nof the most liberal and thorough<br />\nresearch administrations in the country,<br />\nwhich has helped attract both manY<br />\ngrants and well-known researchers.<br />\n\"Princeton, for example, has a<br />\ncommittee which holds every research<br />\nproject for 6 weeks,\" he said \"This<br />\nmany times causes a project to miss the<br />\napplication deadline.\"<br />\nAlso, the Institute officer stated that<br />\nthe reputation and interests of Hopkins<br />\nalways comes before any individual<br />\nprofessor. \"If it is believed that a grant<br />\nrestricts the University, or for other<br />\nreasons harmful, the proposal will not<br />\nbe approved,\" he said. About 1 per cent<br />\nof research grants or contracts are<br />\nconducted by a Hopkins professor<br />\noutside the Institute of Sponsored<br />\nResearch's control, he noted.<br />\nMcLeod stated that the change from<br />\na Cooperative to a Sponsored Institute<br />\nmade it a more integral part of the<br />\nadministration.<br />\n<br />\nHigh Schoolers Get Lectured<br />\nHopkins is currently<br />\noffering<br />\nBaltimore area high school students a<br />\nlecture series in the field of<br />\nInternational Relations featuring Dr.<br />\nLincoln Gordon as a speaker.<br />\nInternational Relations is the theme<br />\nof this year's High School Lecture<br />\nSeries, annually \"offered in an effort to<br />\nprovide services to the community,\"<br />\naccording to Victor Dates, Director of<br />\nSpecial Events at Hopkins.<br />\nThe three previous lecture series have<br />\ncovered topics in biology, history and<br />\n\u2014 English.<br />\nThis year's series was begun by Dr.<br />\nIsiah Frank, Clayton Professor of<br />\n<br />\nInternational Economics at the School<br />\nof Advanced International Studies<br />\n(SAIS) in Washington.

If there is any<br />\ndirection in which we're headed around here, there's got<br />\nto be communication.\" Faxon believed that any group<br />\nrepresenting students on the campus should be able to<br />\nspeak with President Gordon directly, and not through<br />\nintermediaries. Ile was referring to SDS-NUC demands<br />\nto speak with the President. The demands led to the<br />\nHomewood sit-in this week.<br />\n<br />\nDean Rudoy, while agreeing that the<br />\nadministration hact over-reacted to the sit-in on Tuesday,<br />\nstated that there are established methods for student<br />\ngroups to gain access to Dr. Gordon.\"The unwillingness<br />\nof these two groups to communicate their feelings to the<br />\nadministraton through legitimate channels\u2014proven to be<br />\neffective\u2014seems to be indicative of their unwillingness to<br />\ncommunicate,\" said Rudoy in a resolution that will be<br />\nsubmitted to the Council on Monday. Rudoy explained<br />\nthat he felt SDS-NUC wanted a confrontation instead of<br />\nmeaningful discussions with the Presidpnt.<br />\nRadical Rodriguez<br />\nS.C. Vice-President Manuel Rodriguez criticized<br />\nthe administration attempt to evict the students from<br />\nHomewood House in another resolution to be placed<br />\nbefore the Council Monday. \"In light of the facts<br />\navailable to me, I deplore the administration's<br />\nover-reaction and threat of 'suspension and appropriate<br />\n<br />\nTwo Groups Circulate Anti-SDS Petitions<br />\nBy RICHARD HEDDLESON<br />\nIn response to the sit-in last Tuesday at<br />\nHomewood House, two student groups have<br />\ncirculated petitions which condemn the use of<br />\nviolence and \"outside agitators\" to further<br />\nstudent demands.<br />\nThe first petitions is being promoted by three<br />\nresidents of Gildersleeve House, in the freshman dorms.<br />\nThe petition \"deplores the forceful entry and use of<br />\noutside agitators by the SDS and the NUC.\" The<br />\nfreshmen spearheading this petition are Bill Strisever,<br />\nRichard McKenna and Wayne Matus. They decided to<br />\ncirculate the petition .after \\ a group of ten or so got<br />\ntogether and talked about our extreme dislike for the<br />\ntactics being used by the SDS,\" according to McKenna.<br />\n\"Initiation of Force\"<br />\nThe other petition is being circulated under the<br />\ndirection of upperclassmen Bill Van Doren, Michael<br />\nMarcus and Laurence Shatkin. It states that the<br />\n\"University should neither recognize nor negotiate with<br />\nany group that uses the initiation of force.\" It also asks<br />\nthe University to state that it will protect members of<br />\nthe community from coercive violence and to stop \"any<br />\nfuture occupation of university property by whatever<br />\nlegitimate means are necessary.\" Further, it calls for the<br />\npunishment of acts of violence and coercion and the<br />\nexpulsion of repeated offenders.<br />\nUnlike the freshman petition, the upperclass<br />\npetition is not a spontaneous reaction to the Tuesday<br />\nsit-in. \"We made provisions to take actions like this four<br />\nmonths ago,\" stated Van Doren. The students had<br />\npreviously organized an ad hoc Committee Against<br />\nStudent Terrorism. Van Doren said that the committee<br />\nmay also issue a position paper on ROTC. He was also<br />\ncritical of President Gordon. He said, \"Dr. Gordon<br />\nshould have been more forthright in expressing his<br />\nopinions. We would advocate a more unequivocal<br />\nstand.\"<br />\n\"Better Picture\"<br />\nMcKenna said that the purpose of the freshman<br />\npetition was to \"give Dr. Gordon a better picture of<br />\nstudent feeling and display support for him and extreme<br />\n<br />\ndislike for the tactics used (by:SDS).\" McKenna said his<br />\ngroup planned to present the petition to Dr. Gordomat<br />\nnext week's convocation.<br />\nVan Doren's group \"does not necessarily support<br />\nprevious positions of Dr. Gordon.\" In fact, Van Doren<br />\n\"would have approved of having police brought onto the<br />\ncampus.<br />\nSteve Shriver of SDS said that 'the whole thing<br />\n(the Homewood House sit-in) was non-violent and there<br />\nwas no forced entry.\" Matus, one of the proponents of<br />\nthe freshman petition, defined forced entry as \"going in<br />\nsome place where you just aren't particularly wanted.\"<br />\n<br />\naction,'\" declared Rodriguez. \"While not in full<br />\nagreement with the general SDS-NUC tactics and goals,<br />\nsupport their demand for an open convocation and in<br />\nairing of the fact: regarding the militarization of<br />\nHopkins.\"<br />\nMost of the m;mbers of the Student Council said<br />\nthe proper channel for student inputs was the S.C.<br />\nPresident Russ Passarella explained that Dr. Gordon<br />\nrecognizes the S.C. as the \\ representative student organ.<br />\nPassarella and Rudoy believed the SDS-NUC should first<br />\nhave consulted with the Student Council before<br />\ndemanding that the President answer them.<br />\nRodriguez disagreed, saying that there should be a<br />\nbetter system whereby student groups can speak direcdY<br />\nwith the President, and he supported the claim of the<br />\nSDS-NUC that Gordon should have directly answered<br />\ntheir letters and met with them. _<br />\nRuss Passarella agreed with other members that<br />\nthe S.C. should develop closer contacts with the<br />\nAcademic Council. He and the other members present<br />\nstated unanimously that every student crisis this Year<br />\nhas been solved only after students threatened a<br />\nconfrontation.<br />\n\"Arrogant and Insulting\"<br />\nOn Tuesday, Dr. Gordon called the SDS-NUC<br />\ndemands \"arrogant and insulting.\" He told the<br />\nNews-Letter Wednesday that he was not prepared to<br />\nmeet with the SDS-NUC. Hedialso said he found the<br />\nHomewood sit-in \"a discourtesy,\" and a personal affront<br />\nto Vice-President William Bevan. Gordon said Bevan was<br />\ninstructed to listen to the demands and report the\u00b0,<br />\nback to him. He stated that the students' refusal to tai\"<br />\nto Bevan was a \"personal insult\" to the Vice President,<br />\n<br />\nSDS Claims Demonstration Victory<br />\nDespite the vociferous student support of<br />\nPresident Gordon during Tuesday's open<br />\nmeeting in front of Homewood House, both<br />\nSDS and NUC leaders claimed a \"significant\"<br />\nvictory in their anti-ROTC demonstration.<br />\nPointing to the fact that Dr. Gordon had returned to<br />\nHomewood House after declaring that the\"convocation\"<br />\nwould be held at Levering, and adding that all but one of<br />\nthe original SDS objectives had been achieved, SDS<br />\nclaimed Tuesday's actions succesful.<br />\n\"Clashes Inevitable\"<br />\n\"First of all, and this is most important,\" stated<br />\nStephen Shriver, an SDS leader,\"is the fact that we<br />\nraised the issues. What had originally been obscured has<br />\nnow been brought out into the open.\" Admitting that<br />\nhostility, too, had increased during the afternoon, he<br />\nclaimed that \"a polarizing effect is inevitable in clashes<br />\nof this sort.\"<br />\nThe second major point, which was brought out in an<br />\nSDS-NUC post-demonstration meeting, was that the<br />\ndemands were not rejected, nor were the original aims<br />\nthwarted. \"We accomplished everything we set out to<br />\naccomplish,\" claimed Bob Paskoff, another SDS<br />\nleader,\"except for eliciting a statement on militarism at<br />\nHopkins.\" Even this, declared Shriver, is an admission of<br />\nsorts, for \"it shows that the Administration cannot<br />\ncommit itself to an open community.\"<br />\n.r<br />\n<br />\n\u2022<br />\n<br />\n4ko<br />\n<br />\nThe objectives which SDS-NUC claimed were<br />\nsuccessfully carried out included the handing over of the<br />\nanti-ROTC petitions to Dr. Gordon, the agreement 00<br />\nthe part of the administration to the holding of an ope\u00b0<br />\nconvocation with an open microphone in the netari<br />\nfuture, and the statement by Dr. Gordon that he woui.'\"<br />\nbring up the three original SDS demands in et,<br />\nAcademic Council.

The radicals<br />\nclaim, and were backed by most witnesses, that V!'<br />\nSwanson specifically stated that whatever he had said V)<br />\nthe Friday assemblage was a private person, and not as<br />\nan administrator.<br />\nSDS used this position to justify its sit-in at4<br />\nHomewood House, claiming that Dr. Gordon hau<br />\nignored every previous radical demand.

It is very<br />\npossible that after his commission<br />\nmakes its report May 22 \u2014 a report<br />\nWhich will almost certainly recommend<br />\nrevision \u2014 the Governor will rely on the<br />\nfact that the schools and colleges where<br />\nClamor for revision is strongest will be<br />\nout the summer recess.

He.<br />\nis courting the Baltimore medical<br />\nMaryland<br />\nestablishment, as any<br />\npolitician has to.<br />\nThere is serious question about the<br />\nconstitutionality of the new law, which<br />\nhas been portrayed as a \"liberalization\"<br />\nbut which in fact is unliberal. The bill<br />\ndid not pass through routine General<br />\nAssembly channels, and it looks like it \u2014<br />\nalmost nobody in Annapolis has even<br />\nread it and very few know what it says.<br />\nSeveral legislators refused to be<br />\nco-sponsors of it because of the<br />\nquestionable constitutionality. It was<br />\nintroduced late in the last-minute rush<br />\nof the last session, by the son of a<br />\nBaltimore judge. The old man wrote it,<br />\nand the son hustled it through to<br />\npassage.<br />\nFirst, the law applies to \"drug<br />\naddiction,\" but includes in its provisions<br />\n. the use of marijuana and any other<br />\nsubstances which may,in other places in<br />\nthe body of law of this State, be later<br />\ndetermined to be \"dangerous,\" whether<br />\naddicting or not.<br />\n<br />\nany person related to the suspected<br />\naddict, or that failing, anybody who<br />\nlives in the same house.<br />\nIf found not be be an addict within<br />\nthe meaning of the law, the person is<br />\nreturned to the judge who may still use<br />\nhis offices to \"cure\" the anti-social<br />\nbehavior which brought the person to<br />\nhis attention in the first place.<br />\nThe persons suspected may appeal at<br />\nevery stage, but if he is under 21 most<br />\nof the important documents regarding<br />\nhis case are only available to his parents,<br />\nwho may be the ones who turned him in<br />\nthe first place. Any chance of<br />\nprosecuting a successful appeal, already<br />\nrare, are rendered hypothetical.<br />\nVisualize a kid 16 or 17 who is<br />\nintelligent but who lacks motivation in<br />\nschool and is uncommunicative with his<br />\nparents. Finally, in desperation one<br />\nnight following an especially hostile<br />\nevening meal the parents approach a<br />\njudge for advice. He asks if the kid is<br />\nlethargic or introspective. On the basis<br />\nof the parents' answers, he orders the<br />\nkid for treatment. He tells the parents<br />\n\"It's all for the best.\"<br />\n<br />\nSecond, it defines addicts so loosely<br />\nthat almost anyone can be made to fit<br />\nthe definition. For example, a drug<br />\naddict is any \"person exhibiting the<br />\nsymptoms of drug addiction;\" or<br />\nsomebody \"in imminent danger od<br />\nbecoming addicted.\" Under this<br />\ndefinition it is easy to see that, relying<br />\non the old saw that marijuana use leads<br />\nto herein addiction, any user of<br />\nmajijuana is in imminent danger of<br />\nbecoming an addict.<br />\nAfter identifying a possible addict<br />\nunder the new law, he is brought before<br />\na judge. The judge may find him to be<br />\nan addict within the meaning of the law<br />\nand order him incarcerated for<br />\ntreatment for up to seven years,<br />\nalthough he has to renew his order every<br />\nyear.<br />\nIf the judge believes the addict is not<br />\nlikely to report for treatment, he can<br />\nplace him in custody for delivery to<br />\ntreatment.

The letter informed the students that the author would not<br />\nwrite letters of recommendation for any student who participated in a<br />\nviolent or unruly demonstration.<br />\nThe professor justified his decision, stating that the way in which a<br />\nstudent construes the institution and his academic environment is an<br />\nimportant criterion for judging the student as a future teacher. What was<br />\nimplicit was the premise that any student who has participated in a violent<br />\nor unruly demonstration did not possess a proper or correct view of his<br />\nacademic environment. To this point, though there is heated argument in<br />\nmany circles concerning the letter, the professor has declined to publicly<br />\nacknowledge his authorship, to amplify or further define any of the<br />\nletter's statements; indeed, to acknowledge any public responsibility for<br />\nthe content of the letter at all.<br />\nWhen Dr. Mann read a copy of the letter to the crowd at Tuesday's<br />\nrally, however, the contents of the letter became almost common<br />\nnot<br />\nknowledge. Although the name of the faculty member-author was<br />\nthe<br />\nof<br />\nidentity<br />\nthe<br />\ntogether<br />\npiece<br />\nto<br />\nenough<br />\neasy<br />\nrevealed, people found it<br />\nhis<br />\nd<br />\nemploye<br />\nprofessor<br />\nthe<br />\nthat<br />\nfact<br />\nthe<br />\nis<br />\nevident<br />\nauthor. Equally<br />\nmoral<br />\nthe<br />\ninhibit<br />\nacademic position and prestige to covertly influence and<br />\nand social beliefs of his students.<br />\nMoreover, the letter, unsupplemented by conversation as it is, leaves<br />\nunclear the definitions of \"violent\" and \"participation.\" These two words,<br />\nobviously keys to understanding the letter's warning, remain undefined so<br />\nthat the letter, on the whole, is subject to a wide range of interpretation.<br />\nBy refusing to discuss the matter further, the professor has insured that<br />\nnot even those over whom he wields his power understand that which<br />\nthey must do (or not do) to escape.<br />\nThe faculty member who sent copies of this letter to the graduate<br />\nstudents has obviously overstrode his rightful prerogatives and the line<br />\nwhich divides respect for a professor from complete surrender of one's<br />\nown freedom of action and coice. Like Dr. Mann, we are ashamed that<br />\n, we<br />\nsuch examples of coercion are to be found on this campus. However<br />\nsuch<br />\nthat<br />\nmembers<br />\nfaculty<br />\nof<br />\nhave not found surprising the statements<br />\nfrom<br />\ncoercion is a more common fact in Hopkins than one would suspect<br />\ncalm.<br />\nthe departments' outer<br />\nis<br />\nThere is much at Hopkins which a student cannot hope to see.

In signing House Bill number 1257 into law, he has added another<br />\nblack mark to an already unimpressive public record. This time, moreover,<br />\nhis actions go past the inequitable to the unconstitutional.<br />\nLeaving questions of legality to the courts, however, the bill may (and,<br />\nin one respect does) have serious repercussions on campus. The bill, the<br />\nComprehensive Drug Abuse Control and Rehabilitation Act, calls for the<br />\nmandatory appearance in court of an alleged addict on the strength of an<br />\norder signed by a parent, relative, or anyone living in the same house as<br />\nthe addict. For Hopkins students both on and off campus, this means<br />\none's roommate.<br />\nNot only can court-ordered incarceration last up to seven years,- but the<br />\nother provisions of the law are equally harsh: refusal to show up in court<br />\nresults in a warrant for arrest, and escape from a rehabilitation center is a<br />\nfelony. Furthermore, the decision is made by a judge, not a doctor, and<br />\nnowhere does the procedure involve the use of a jury: All this, it must be<br />\nremembered, takes place without the commission of a crime.<br />\nThe bill's backers claim it to be liberal, pointing to its rehabilitative<br />\nprovisions, and claim it to be necessary, citing figures on drug-related<br />\ncrimes. What they ignore is the fact that the term \"addict\" is so loosely<br />\ndefined that it renders the concept of \"addiction\" meaningless.<br />\nFurthermore, one need only be \"in danger of becoming an addict\" to fall<br />\nunder the provisos of the law. Conceivably, one who is considering<br />\nsmoking marijuana could be acted against as an addict.<br />\nThe other point is that Mr. Mandel's actions clearly violate his pledge<br />\nto the signers of last Thursday's Open Letter to look into their complaints<br />\nafter the Blue Ribbon Committee submits its report on drug abuse on May<br />\n22. There is no indication that Mr. Mandel is in the least concerned with<br />\nthe difference between cannabis and heroin, nor for that matter, with the<br />\nviews of the President and the students of Johns Hopkins, and the other<br />\nnotables who signed that statement.<br />\nWe, unfortunately, are quite concerned about him.<br />\n<br />\nAMP -THAT<br />\nAioeK.<br />\n<br />\nSo I -icor<br />\nSPEW -ro<br />\nSOLVE MY<br />\n<br />\nPROOLCHs-<br />\n<br />\nVM<br />\nA<br />\nHAVEMELA)<br />\n10-10/.6<br />\nST<br />\n7t2081.OFE4s.<br />\n<br />\n-NT<br />\nAIXPIPNT<br />\nWOW<br />\n<br />\n\fPAGE 8<br />\n<br />\nNEWS\u2014LETTER<br />\n<br />\nHOMEWOOD,BALTIMORE,MAY 9, 1969<br />\n<br />\nABM Threat Continues to Haunt Congress<br />\nBy SENATOR JOSEPH D. TYDINGS<br />\nSpecial to the News-Letter<br />\nThe Administration's decision to<br />\ndeploy the Safeguard anti-ballistic<br />\nmissile system is one of the most crucial<br />\nmatters to come before Congress in this<br />\ndecade. For there is more at stake than<br />\nan enormously expensive complex of<br />\nmilitary equipment. We are being asked<br />\nto make a decision that could easily<br />\naffect our national security and the<br />\ncourse of the arms race, as well as the<br />\nvery nature of our society in the years<br />\nahead.<br />\nOur defense budget has expanded at<br />\nan incredible rate, to the point where<br />\ndefense-related<br />\nmilitary<br />\nand<br />\nexpenditures consume more than<br />\ntwo-thirds of every American income<br />\ntax dollar. Congressional failure to<br />\ncarefully analyze and evaluate defense<br />\nspending has permitted much waste and<br />\nduplication.<br />\nGiven our unprecedented inflation,<br />\nthe growing burden of the American<br />\ntaxpayer, and the implacable urgency of<br />\nour domestic problems, this \"buy<br />\nwhatever the generals want\" attitude<br />\ntowards military spending is a luxury we<br />\ncan no longer afford.<br />\nBeyond a Certain Point<br />\nThe advance of nuclear weaponry has<br />\nintroduced a new factor into strategic<br />\ncalculus: beyond a certain point<br />\nadditional military appropriations and<br />\nequipment may not be translatable into<br />\nincreased national security or useful<br />\npolitical power. In other words, since<br />\nboth the Soviet Union and the United<br />\nStates have sufficient nuclear power to<br />\nstart a nuclear attack and then to<br />\ndestroy the attackers' society with a<br />\nsecond strike, additional dollars spent<br />\non weapons do not necessarily enhance<br />\nour strength or security.<br />\nIt is within this framework that I<br />\nwould like to discuss the recent decision<br />\nto proceed with the deployment of an<br />\nanti-ballistic missile system.<br />\nLet me begin with a careful<br />\nthe<br />\nDefense<br />\nexamination<br />\nof<br />\nDepartment's reasons for requesting the<br />\nmoney for an ABM system. Though the<br />\njustifications for deploying ABM have<br />\nshifted with the political winds both<br />\nduring this administration and the last,<br />\nSecretary of Defense Laird offered three<br />\nprincipal reasos for constructing the<br />\nSafeguard<br />\nsystem<br />\nduring recent<br />\nCongressional hearings:<br />\nFirst, to defend against a<br />\npossible Chinese nuclear missile<br />\n<br />\nSENATOR TYDINGS<br />\nattack;<br />\n<br />\n\u2014Second, to defend against a<br />\n\"light\" irrational or accidental<br />\nattack by the Soviet Union;<br />\n\u2014Third, to protect a portion of<br />\nour offensive missile forces for a<br />\nsecond-strike capability against a<br />\npossible Soviet attempt to develop<br />\npotential to wipe out our<br />\noffensive force through a massive<br />\npreemptive nuclear attack.<br />\nDon't Hold Water<br />\nAt the same time, spokesmen for the<br />\nDefense Department indicated what the<br />\nABM was not supposed to do.<br />\n\u2014First, it was not to be a defense<br />\nof our cities against an all-out<br />\nattack, for this was deemed<br />\nbeyond present technological<br />\ncapabilities;<br />\n\u2014Second, it was not to provoke<br />\nthe Soviets into reacting, thereby<br />\nsetting off another expensive<br />\nround in the arms race;<br />\n\u2014Third, it was not to undermine<br />\nin any way our chances of<br />\nreaching agreements with the<br />\nSoviets on arms control and<br />\nlimitation.<br />\nThese arguments for the ABM simply<br />\ndo not hold water. To begin with, the<br />\ncase made by the Pentagon for the<br />\ndeployment of ABM installations<br />\naround our Minutemen sites in<br />\nMalmstrom, Montana, and Grand Forks,<br />\nNorth<br />\nDakota,<br />\nis<br />\nrife<br />\nwith<br />\ninconsistencies and contradictions.<br />\nIf the Chinese ever chose irrationally<br />\nto attack \u2014 and it should be<br />\n<br />\nremembered they still do not possess a<br />\ndeliverable nuclear attack capability \u2014 it<br />\nwould surely consist of a suicidal<br />\nnuclear bombardment of our cities, and<br />\nnot a strike against our missile bases.<br />\nFor the Chinese will not have a<br />\nsufficient number of warheads in the<br />\nforseeable future to attempt to destroy<br />\nour second strike capability, that is,<br />\nour ability to absorb a nuclear attack<br />\nwith enough of our missiles intact to<br />\ndevastate China in response.<br />\nThe proposed ABM system is simply<br />\nnot designed to defend cities. The<br />\ncontemplated ABM system consists of<br />\ntwo different types of missiles: the<br />\nSpartan missile which is designed to<br />\nintercept enemy missiles before they<br />\nre-enter earth's atmosphere and which<br />\nhas a range of approximately 400 miles;<br />\nand the smaller Sprint missile, with a<br />\nrange of 25-30 miles, which is supposed<br />\nto pick up enemy projectiles that<br />\npenetrate the Spartan defense and<br />\ndisarm them 100,000 feet above their<br />\ntargets.<br />\nDevastate our Cities<br />\nGiven the location of the two ABM<br />\ninstallations proposed for initial<br />\nconstruction by the Administration, the<br />\nonly one of the nation's 25 largest cities<br />\nthat would receive even theoretical<br />\nprotection against a Chinese attack<br />\nwould be Minneapolis. The rest of our<br />\nurban population would remain as<br />\nvulnerable as before.<br />\nWould this situation be remedied by<br />\ndeploying the ten additional sites the<br />\n<br />\nPentagon is reportedly contemplating? I<br />\nthink not. According to scientists both<br />\nin and Out of government, it is relatively<br />\neasy to deceive the radar which guides<br />\nthe Spartan missiles with decoys and<br />\nother deception devices. It is not until<br />\nobjects actually re-enter the atmosphere<br />\nthat radar can reliably differentiate the<br />\ndecoys from the real thing. At this<br />\npoint,it falls to the Sprint to provide the<br />\nultimate protection.<br />\nBut the Pentagon has announced its<br />\nintention to place its ABM sites a<br />\nconsiderable distance from our cities,<br />\nwhich<br />\nwould place our major<br />\npopulation centers outside the range of<br />\nthe Sprints. Thus, with a little ingenuity<br />\nand the technical proficiency which the<br />\nSoviets now have sand the Chinese will<br />\nlikely possess soon, they could<br />\npenetrate our Spartan defense and<br />\ndevastate our cities.<br />\nIn other words, the justification of<br />\nthe ABM as protection against a Chinese<br />\nnuclear attack simply defies the facts.<br />\nThe argument that the ABM would<br />\nprovide useful protection against a less<br />\nthan \"all-out\" irrational or accidental<br />\nattack by the Soviets is hardly more<br />\nconvincing.<br />\nDefies Reason<br />\nThe \"irrationality\" of a Soviet Missile<br />\nattack on the U.S. would be irrational<br />\nbecause it would be suicidal. Regardless<br />\nof the destruction wreaked on the U.S.,<br />\nthe U.S.S.R. would also be obliterated<br />\nin the process. However, to assume that<br />\nsuch a Soviet attack might also be<br />\n\"irrational\" enough to be less than<br />\n\"all-out\" defies reason.<br />\nWhy should any Soviet leader send<br />\nonly a few missiles over when he knows<br />\nthe U.S. will retaliate with its full<br />\nsecond-strike force? Even men as mad as<br />\nHitler were never guilty of such<br />\nthoughtless accomodation to then<br />\nenemies. If the Soviets did attack, it<br />\nwould certainly be with full force,<br />\nwhich by the Pentagon's own reckoning<br />\nwould render the proposed Safeguard<br />\nsystem useless.<br />\nAs for accidental attack, I assume it<br />\nwould consist of one or two missiles<br />\nthat unintentionally \"got away\".<br />\nIf this enemy missile were targeted at<br />\na missile site, we would at most siMPIY<br />\nlose a few of our 1,000 ICBM's, and a<br />\nfew lives would be lost. It is hardLY<br />\nworth the vast- expense of an ABM<br />\nsystem to insure against loss of a few<br />\ndrastically less expensive ICBM's.<br />\n(Continued on Page 9)<br />\n<br />\nVeritas<br />\n<br />\nritOTC<br />\n<br />\nDefended: Defining the IssuesI<br />\n<br />\nBy ROBERT M. LIPSHUTZ<br />\nThere are three broad subdivisions under Athich<br />\n.<br />\nthe<br />\ncurrent. ROTC issue should be discussed: issues inherent<br />\nwithin ROTC, the larger issues in which the controversy<br />\nis placed, and the role of political action.<br />\nIn support of continuing the ROTC program, many<br />\npoints can be made. First, the program is a voluntary<br />\nextracurricular activity. For those who do not opt to<br />\ntake it, they may drop out at any time in the first two<br />\nyears. Upon graduation, a student may resign his<br />\ncommission. For those who stay in, they can get through<br />\ntheir military service in two years as officers.<br />\nFor those who do not disagree with the war, or who<br />\ndo not want to spend years evading the draft, it is a very<br />\neasy way to get through the service. It is as wrong to<br />\ndeny someone the opportunity to make this moral<br />\nchoice as it would be to make ROTC compulsory.<br />\nROTC civilianizes the Army. Of the second<br />\nlieutenants who enter the Army each year, 45% are<br />\nROTC trained. They most often serve two years and<br />\nleave. Those who remain, rise disproportionately to<br />\nleadership positions. Col. Parmly, director of ROTC on<br />\nthe Johns Hopkins campus, informed me that when he<br />\nattended Command General Staff College at Fort<br />\nLeavenworth, Kansas, in 1959, over two-thirds were not<br />\nfrom the service academies, with most of these from<br />\nROTC.<br />\nBroader Perspective<br />\nGiving military training during the college experience<br />\nprovides a constant contrast between Army training and ,<br />\nthe less heirarchical and more two-way process (in<br />\ntheory, at least) of a university education. For social<br />\nscience and humanities majors, ROTC provides an<br />\n<br />\nopportunity to contrast both the subject matter and the<br />\nmeans of presentations of both modes of learning. This<br />\nbrings a broader perspective to the military. Since only<br />\n45% of second lieutenants are ROTC graduates and most<br />\nleave after two years, the fact is that 65% of those<br />\ntrained for eventual promotion to general are ROTC<br />\ngraduates indicates that the Army values this<br />\nperspective.<br />\nOfficer candidate school and the service academies are<br />\nnot as good for training officers in a civilian-run,<br />\ndemocratic nation, as is ROTC. Both put the process of<br />\nsocialization of the armed forces totally in the hands of<br />\nthe military. Without ready access to alternate modes of<br />\nthinking during this process, the officer who emerges<br />\ncannot help but be less willing to question basic tenets<br />\nof military doctrine.<br />\nAs these men rise to 1;.:, top leadership positions<br />\nwithin the service, they tend more to emphasize force<br />\ninternally and externally than would a soldier trained in<br />\na civilian context.<br />\nBut ROTC, secret research and even the Vietnam<br />\nwar are only parts of the larger issue of the power<br />\nstructure of this society, the nature of the forces which<br />\nbenefit from it and sustain it, and what if anything<br />\nshould be done to change it. The other issues are at best<br />\nperipheral.<br />\nOstrich Idealism<br />\nPeripheral issues may be thought of as valuable in an<br />\neducatory process. Without discussing this point, the<br />\nvalid objection that can be raised to the use of ROTC as<br />\nan issue is that terminating ROTC could only militarize<br />\nthe service, and hence the society, even more than it is<br />\nnow. The point can be seen in even better perspective if<br />\n<br />\neach student will think upon his friends from back hont.e<br />\nwho went into the service instead of college. Imagine If<br />\nthey ran the military and advised national leaders.<br />\nThe anti-war partisans, one of which I am not, have to<br />\n.,<br />\nmake a basic choice. They can indulge in ostrich idealis111<br />\nby battling to remove ROTC from campus, which valI<br />\ntake away the daily reminders of war but will make 3<br />\nmore militarized nation. They may becorne<br />\nrevolutionaries and wait for the walls of society to come<br />\ntumbling down.<br />\nOr, they can go through the hard, slogging process Of<br />\npolitical agitation. The McCarthy campaign changed the.<br />\ncourse of politics in 1968. It brought issues before the.<br />\npeople of this nation, and won friends for the anti-war<br />\ncause. In not too long, primaries will be held for<br />\ncongressmen and senators across the nation. Tile<br />\nMcCarthy effort was quickly put together and yen'<br />\ndisorganized.<br />\nIf preceded by an effective and vigorous campair!'<br />\nthe anti-war forces for Congress may increase their,.<br />\nstrength in 1970, and even before then a campaign.\u00b0'<br />\nmass agitation may intensify the peace drive building<br />\nwithin the. President's own party, as the recent<br />\nAiken-Scott statements show. If the anti-war people<br />\nhave any faith in their own cause, then the choice is Ot<br />\ntoo hard to make. If they have a good case, why not trY<br />\nto make it most effectively?<br />\nFor those who claim that this course is too long or<br />\ntoo unsure, it seems much saner than the touch-me4 0<br />\n.,t,<br />\nattitude of the anti-ROTC efforts. The U.S. Army vs\"<br />\nget officers and leaders. The questions that should be<br />\nasked are what kinds of officers and for what theY<br />\nshould be used.<br />\n<br />\n\f..HOMEWOOD, BALTIMORE, MAY 9,1969<br />\n<br />\nPAGE 9<br />\n<br />\nNEWS\u2014LETTER<br />\n<br />\nAmerican Heritage<br />\n<br />\nRegents Radicalize Rowdy Right-Wing Redneck<br />\n<br />\ni<br />\n<br />\nBy ED MENDELSOHN<br />\nFrom 1925 to 1937, especially towards the end of the<br />\nPeriod, the best known state university president in the<br />\nUnited States was probably Dr. Glenn Frank of the<br />\nUniversity of Wisconsin. Frank is best remembered for..<br />\nhis violent polemics against the New Deal,<br />\nwhich gained<br />\nintensity after he was deposed as University president by<br />\nthe Board of Regents under Governor Philip<br />\nLaFollette.<br />\nIndeed, he became such a prominent Republican<br />\nSpokesman as to figure in speculation for the 1940<br />\nnational ticket. He did receive a Wisconsin nomination<br />\nfor U.S. Senator that year, but died<br />\nin mid-campaign.<br />\nHowever, it may be of more interest than a review of<br />\nhis political career to consider the development of<br />\nFrank's thought in the 1920's. The polemics against the<br />\nNew Deal are not a distinctive contribution. Earlier,<br />\nduring his career on the editorial staff of the Century<br />\nMagazine, Frank produced some interesting papers on<br />\none of the major questions in our<br />\nhistory. This is the<br />\nrole of the scholar in politics.<br />\nIntellectually Superior<br />\n, Only a minority of university presidents become<br />\n'actors in the politics of their time, and these have<br />\ndiffered as to how deeply they should pursue a political<br />\near.eer. Woodrow Wilson, whose reform drive<br />\nat<br />\nPrinceton had struck a hopeless impasse<br />\nin 1910, was<br />\nready to shuck his academic robes entirely; Nicholas<br />\n<br />\nMurray Butler, who had a flourishing establishment at<br />\nColumbia in 1904, positively refused to seek the<br />\nGovernorship of New York.<br />\nDr. Butler, however, was generally frustrated as to the<br />\ninfluence he could exert in politics. This contagion has<br />\nstruck several others who were intellectually superior to<br />\nthe reigningpoliticians and felt their political influence<br />\nwas in inverse proportions to their intellect. The<br />\nexample of Henry Adams leaps immediately to mind;<br />\nEdward Everett, John C. Calhoun, William E. Borah and<br />\nother members of the Adams family are also on record<br />\nwith favorable impressions of their own intellectual<br />\nprowess.<br />\n\u2022<br />\n<br />\nBad Candidate<br />\n<br />\nIn this case there is a tendency for the disappointed<br />\npower-seeker to reject democracy entirely. Henry<br />\nAdams, who spent several years at the center of<br />\ngovernment without apparently influencing any of its<br />\nacts, eventually consummated a retreat from modern<br />\ntimes in his Mont Saint-Michel and Chartres.<br />\nThe formidably learned Henry Cabot Lodge, who was<br />\navailable for the Presidential nomination in 1916 and<br />\n1920, came to a total rejection of the system of<br />\n<br />\nPresidential elections, lie wrote that he would make a<br />\ngood president but a bad candidate.<br />\nFrank definitely agreed with Senator Lodge's private<br />\njudgement that a democracy does not bring its best men<br />\ninto government. Butler made the same judgment\u2022<br />\npublicly, in both speech and writing. One of the<br />\ncharacteristics which Frank assigned to democracy was<br />\nthat \"It rarely elects its best men to office except by<br />\naccident\".<br />\nMinimal Influence<br />\nThe heart of Frank's philosophy is that while a man<br />\nof superior intellectual attainments was physically<br />\ncapable of entering politics, he would thereupon debase<br />\nhimself by pandering to the crowd.

It is based on the claim<br />\nthat our second-strike capability is being<br />\nthreatened by the Soviets<br />\nand that<br />\nPleasures must<br />\nbe taken to protect<br />\nPortions of our second-strike force.<br />\n. If in fact our retaliatory capability is<br />\nIrlp_cluestion, we must act immediately to<br />\ntore it. The<br />\nSoviets must never doubt<br />\n,<br />\nc4r ability to inflict unacceptable<br />\n\"'linage to their society in response to a<br />\n:1\u201eIseL-emptive attack. This is the very<br />\nZ\u00b0stance of our deterrent strategy. If<br />\nretaliatory capability is in question,<br />\nild,itions to our offensive forces, not<br />\nIlelous defensive missiles, ought to be<br />\n\u00b0Qr<br />\nstrategy.<br />\nThere is no evidence that our<br />\n7ond-strike<br />\ncapability<br />\nis being<br />\na.eatened<br />\nr<br />\nor that Moscow doubts its<br />\nglectiveness.<br />\np Last month, before the Senate<br />\norei<br />\n\u2014<br />\nbisa gn Relations Subcommittee on<br />\n-rmament, Secretary igt Defense<br />\n7d declared that the Russians \"are<br />\nmg for a first strike capability \u2014 there<br />\n,<br />\n1 110 question about that.\" This came as<br />\nitmlock to those of us in Congress who<br />\nLe,acutely interested in this nation's<br />\nense posture.<br />\nDoubts Mr. Laird<br />\nthThe National Intelligence Estimate \u2014<br />\nhie, consensus view of the Defense<br />\ntelligence<br />\nAgency,<br />\nthe<br />\nState<br />\n1,,v Partment,<br />\nthe<br />\nCentral<br />\nand<br />\nkqt.elligence Agency \u2014 de n i es the<br />\n615,tence of any first-strike plans on<br />\nthe<br />\nof the Kremlin or any signs that<br />\nplans are in the making.

This is a total of<br />\n2400 nuclear missiles, eached armed<br />\nwith one or more nuclear warheads.<br />\nAccording to former Secretary of<br />\nDefense McNamara's estimates, it would<br />\ntake no more than 400 nuclear<br />\nwarheads to damage the Soviet Union<br />\nbeyond recognition and repair.<br />\nMr. Laird bases his claims about<br />\nSoviet intentions to develop a<br />\nfirst-strike capability on the deployment<br />\nof 200 Russian SS9 missiles.

Suddenly, without<br />\nexplanation the Secretary of Defense<br />\nhas decreed that they are now<br />\nfirst-strike weapons.<br />\nEven accepting this questionable<br />\nturnout, the SS9 provides no reason for<br />\ndeploying an ABM in this country. The<br />\nSoviets would require more than 200 of<br />\nthese SS9's armed with 20 megaton<br />\nwarheads to destroy our entire<br />\nMinutemen force \u2014 and this would still<br />\nleave us with 656 submarine-launched<br />\nmissiles and our intercontinental<br />\nbombers with which to retaliate,<br />\nNo More Provocation<br />\nFinally, the credibility of Mr. Laird's<br />\ncontention that Moscow has first-strike<br />\ndesigns is undermined<br />\nby<br />\nhis<br />\nrecommended response. He is calling for<br />\na limited ABM system that will not<br />\n\"provoke\" the Soviets. If, in fact, the<br />\nSoviets are intent on developing their<br />\ncapability to destroy us and our ability<br />\nto retaliate, and if the ABM is a<br />\nworkable defense, should we not<br />\nproceed immediately with a \"heavy<br />\nsystem\" to protect our people and all<br />\nour missiles? And why are we worried<br />\nabout provoking a nation which<br />\nsupposedly already has decided to go<br />\nall-out to annihilate the United States?<br />\nHow can they be further provoked?<br />\nA careful examination of the three<br />\nprincipal justifications for an ABM<br />\nsystem offered by the Administration<br />\nyields little reason to support<br />\ndeployment. Indeed, the Pentagon's<br />\nown contradictory and inconsistent<br />\ndefense of the system provides a<br />\npersuasive case for its rejection.<br />\nHowever, it is conceivable that a<br />\nproposal may possess merit though it<br />\nwill not do what its proponents claim.<br />\nTherefore, I believe there are several<br />\nother questions that must be raised<br />\nbefore a responsible decision on<br />\ndeployment can be reached.<br />\n<br />\nThe most obvious is whether or not<br />\nthe Safeguard system will actually<br />\ndisarm enemy missiles before they<br />\ndestroy their targets. That is, will it<br />\nwork? The weight of scientific evidence<br />\npresented before the Congress to date<br />\nindicates the ABM will not work.<br />\nSafeguard's technology is essentially<br />\nthe same as that of Nike-X, which was<br />\nrejected as inadequate when it was<br />\ndeveloped. The last five science advisors<br />\nto the President, the President's Science<br />\nAdvisory Committee, and hundreds of<br />\nscientists across the country have<br />\nentertained serious questions about the<br />\ntechnical difficulties an ABM system<br />\nwould encounter. Most of their<br />\nquestions, such as those concerning<br />\nradar blackout, computer programming,<br />\nsaturation, fallout, and command and<br />\ncontrol links, remain unanswered. In<br />\nfact, many can only be answered with<br />\nconfidence under actual combat<br />\nconditions, when it is too late to correct<br />\nsystems failure.<br />\nSo far we have focused on what the<br />\nSafeguard's proponents say it will do \u2014<br />\non its potential benefits. A balanced<br />\nappraisal dictates an evaluation of<br />\npossible<br />\ncosts<br />\nresulting<br />\nfrom<br />\ndeployment.<br />\nFirst, we must consider the impact of<br />\nconstructing an ABM system on the<br />\narms race and international stability.<br />\nThe President contends that because<br />\nthe Safeguard system is \"thin\" and its<br />\navowed<br />\npurpose<br />\nis<br />\ndefensive,<br />\ndeployment will not provoke the<br />\nSoviets into expanding their own missile<br />\nforces. While the absence of a Soviet<br />\nreaction would be welcome, it seems<br />\nhighly unlikely.<br />\nWhy should the Russians, with their<br />\nobsession for defense conditioned by<br />\ntwo World Wars, exercise more restraint<br />\nthan we ourselves have managed? After<br />\nall, the Pentagon's decision to proceed<br />\nwith the Safeguard was partially in<br />\nresponse to the Kremlin's decision to<br />\ndeploy a very limited system around<br />\nMoscow. In addition, this small ABM<br />\nsystem \"provokoed\" us into developing<br />\nmultiple-in dependenly-targeted<br />\nreentry-vehicles (M1RV's) for our own<br />\nmissiles to insure our capacity to<br />\npenetrate anti-missile defenses.<br />\nIncrease Offensive Forces<br />\n' At a minimum, the Soviets could be<br />\nexpected to increase their offensive<br />\nforces sufficiently to saturate our<br />\nSafeguard defenses in Montana and<br />\nNorth Dakota, thereby preserving their<br />\nability to strike our missile bases. More<br />\nlikely, given the action-overreaction<br />\npattern that has characterized the arms<br />\nrace, they would feel compelled to<br />\nincrease their offensive missile forces, to<br />\nexpand their ABM system, and to begin<br />\n<br />\nto develop their own MI RV's.<br />\nOnce both nations begin to deploy<br />\nABM systems and MIRV's, the history<br />\nof strategic arms races will have entered<br />\na disastrous new phase from which there<br />\nmight be no escape. Massive new levels<br />\nof expenditure and danger will be<br />\nimposed on both peoples with no gain<br />\nor security for either.<br />\nBillions for Insecurity<br />\nAs we and the Soviets could no<br />\nlonger accurately estimate either the<br />\noffensive or defensive capabilities of the<br />\nother, both<br />\nnations would<br />\nbe<br />\ncondemned to add continuously to their<br />\narmaments to guarantee that neither<br />\ncould attain a first-strike potential. In<br />\naddition to being incredibly expensive,<br />\nthis endless arms race would produce a<br />\npermanent strategic instability that<br />\nwould invite miscalculation and a<br />\nheightened possibility of a nuclear<br />\nexchange.<br />\nIn other words, deployment of the<br />\nABM and its antidote, the MIRV, would<br />\nplace us in the paradoxical position of<br />\npurchasing insecurity at a very dear<br />\nprice.<br />\nNext, there is the matter of<br />\nopportunity costs. Every government,<br />\nbusiness and household must weigh]<br />\nintended spending against the benefits<br />\nthat would be derived from alternative<br />\nuses of the money.<br />\nDetermining how much the Safeguard<br />\nsystem would cost is difficult. The<br />\nPentagon has provided an estimate of $7<br />\nbillion. However, according to a recent<br />\nBrookings Institute study, U.S. weapons<br />\nsystem consistently cost taxpayers<br />\n300% to 700% more than initial Defense<br />\nDepartment estimates. Therefore, at a<br />\nminimum, we arc contemplating an<br />\nexpenditure of between $21 billion and<br />\n$49 billion.<br />\nMore importantly, increases in<br />\nmilitary<br />\nspending<br />\nwould<br />\nrender<br />\nimpossible the needed reordering of the<br />\nnational agenda. Though we are the<br />\nmost affluent of nations, resources in<br />\nthe public sectpr remain limited. The<br />\nwar in Vietnam and a burgeoning<br />\ndefense budget have compelled us to<br />\nignore pressing domestic problems.<br />\nOur central cities are in an advancing<br />\nstage of deterioration.

The<br />\npoverty that grips these blighted areas<br />\nshatters families and breaks men's<br />\nspirits.

The most distrubing aspect of<br />\nthe recent raid on the Homewood<br />\ndorms was the cry that went up from<br />\nthe non-arrested students, \"We all<br />\nsmoke pot.\"<br />\nIs this true?Certainly not. There are<br />\ndozens of students in the freshman<br />\ndorms who do not turn on, a few who<br />\ndo not use drugs of any kind. But as<br />\na<br />\ngeneralization \"we all smoke pot\" is as<br />\ngood as most. My own estimate is that<br />\n75% of the Hopkins undergraduates<br />\nsmoke; the figure would be higher in the<br />\ndorms, a notorious center for drug use.<br />\nlye talked to half-a-hundred students<br />\n011 their personal estimates; the lowest<br />\nfigure was 50%, the highest 90%. No<br />\nexact count, of course, is available.<br />\nPerhaps more important, I don't know a<br />\nsingle student who disapproves of the<br />\nuse of grass.<br />\nWhy do they do it? Deeper motives<br />\nCan be left to the psychiatrist, but it is<br />\ncertainly not done to defy authority<br />\n(there are hundreds of more ,effective<br />\nWays to do that), or to find deeper<br />\nMeanings in life (that's what LSD is<br />\nlised or for), or as a way to stay up to<br />\nstudY for examinations (speed serves<br />\nthdat purpose, and marjuana slows you<br />\nown). Students turn on because they<br />\nmd it an intensely pleasurable physical<br />\nt.ditors Note: This article first appeared<br />\nThursday edition of the<br />\nRaltitnore Sun<br />\n<br />\n'<br />\n11 last<br />\n<br />\nOP<br />\nES.<br />\n<br />\nsensation and they are convinced that<br />\nthere is absolutely no danger.<br />\nWhen Judge Robert Hammerman told<br />\nthe student meeting at Homewood that<br />\nhe was in favor of changing the laws on<br />\nmarajuana, he was cheered. When he<br />\nadded that he was not saying pot was<br />\nharmless because the medical jury was<br />\nstill out, the students laughed. Many of<br />\nthem have been smoking grass for years;<br />\nall of them know people who have, and<br />\nnone of them has seen any serious<br />\nlong-range adverse effects, or so they<br />\nsay. They are sure they know more<br />\nabout marijuana than the doctors, they<br />\nare convinced that pot is non-habit<br />\nforming, and they feel that it is a far<br />\nsafer drug than alcohol.<br />\nThe middle- and upper-class boys at<br />\nHopkins have watched their parents<br />\ndrink all their lives. Most were<br />\nintroduced to alcohol while they were<br />\nin high school. They much prefer pot.<br />\nAlcohol is a depressant, and although it<br />\ndepresses inhibitions first, that soon<br />\npasses and too much alcohol leads to<br />\nstupor, hardly a pleasurable state for 19<br />\nyear-olds who want experience, not<br />\nescape. Alcohol dries you out and brings<br />\non hangovers. It is expensive. The only<br />\ngood thing about it is that it comes in<br />\nmany varieties, usually tasty, and it is<br />\nsocially acceptable.<br />\nPot does not taste good and you get<br />\ntwo to five years for smoking it but in<br />\nevery other way smokers say it beats<br />\nalcohol. It is cheap (two people can get<br />\nstoned on SI worth). There is no<br />\nhangover, it induces a restful sleep, not<br />\none interrupted by trips to the john of<br />\nintense thirst. Beyond sleep, the big<br />\nthree of pot are music, sex, and food.<br />\nStudents say you can almost taste the<br />\n<br />\n***<br />\n<br />\nmusic when you are stoned, or hear the<br />\nfood. The sense of rhythm is much<br />\nsharper when you are turned then when<br />\nyou are straight, and you hear things in<br />\nthe music you never heard before. Food<br />\ntastes marvelous; sexual pleasure and<br />\ncapacity are heightened, not lowered as<br />\nwith alcohol. The mood is usually one<br />\nof peace and friendliness.<br />\nAs the students at Hopkins see it, to<br />\ngive a two to five year prison term to<br />\nsomeone for smoking pot is absurd,<br />\nespecially when the use of LSD is only a<br />\nmisdemeanor and consuming alcohol no<br />\ncrime at all. And as we learned from<br />\nprohibition, people will not obey laws<br />\nthey judge to be absurd.<br />\nDoes the University know that most<br />\nof its students smoke pot?Of course.<br />\nWhat has it done about it?Nothing. To<br />\nmany of us, this is the most distrubing<br />\naspect of the present affair. The<br />\nUniversity forces freshmen to live in the<br />\ndorms; anyone who has gone to the<br />\nslightest effort to inform himself knows<br />\nwhat is going on there. It throws 18year- olds into a social situation that<br />\nalmost compels them to turn on. To my<br />\nknowledge no parent of an entering<br />\nfreshman is told by University officials<br />\nthat pot prevails in the dorms, nor are<br />\nthe students informed about the<br />\nconsequences of their actions. The<br />\nhousemasters seem to ignore it unless it<br />\naffects grades; when that happens the<br />\nauthorities arrange for counciling for<br />\nthe student in trouble. In short, they<br />\nhelp the individual but do nothing to<br />\nchange the situation.<br />\nLast week three freshmen got busted.<br />\nIt is quite possible that they will serve<br />\njail sentences; it is no exaggeration to<br />\nsay that this will ruin their lives. By any<br />\n<br />\nWhy is Camaro<br />\nthe pace car again?<br />\n<br />\nGM<br />\n<br />\nstandards the Univers<br />\n. ity is. partly<br />\nresponsible for this tragedy. Yet it has<br />\nwashed its hands of the whole affair, is<br />\ndoing nothing to aid the arrested<br />\nstudents, will not take a stand on pot,<br />\nwill not even mobilize its own students, \u2022<br />\nmuch<br />\nless<br />\nthe entire Ilopkins<br />\ncommunity in the three freshmen's<br />\ndefense has said not a single word on<br />\nwhat it proposes to do about the<br />\nsituation prevailing in the dorms.

Unfortunately, this program simply hasn't<br />\ndelivered very much. Although it has trained over 4000<br />\nworkers, it has placed only 1500 of them. The problem<br />\nof trained people, especially blacks, who can't find jobs,<br />\nis still with us. And the anti-poverty effort hasn't<br />\nchanged discrimination, intentional or unintentional.<br />\nBest Aspect<br />\nThe health program is one of the best aspects of the<br />\nagency's work.

This program is in danger, since<br />\nthe Federal government has released some unfavorable<br />\nreports on its performance.<br />\nDone Fairly Well<br />\nGenerally, the Community Action program in<br />\n<br />\nBaltimore has done fairly well with limited resources.<br />\nMuch of its support comes from agencies like the<br />\nDepartment of Labor, so its backing is more secure than<br />\nmost anti-poverty funds. The anti-poverty effort hasn't<br />\naccomplished much locally. Nonetheless, its goals are<br />\nworthy, and it remains a useful means of channeling<br />\nfunds and services into the inner-city,<br />\nAll of these programs remain, of course, quite<br />\nvulnerable to any decision of the.

This was the<br />\ncase with a pioneer economic development program, the<br />\nSmall Business Development Center.<br />\nThe city will be unable to support most of the present<br />\nprograms on its own. Thus any change in opinion or<br />\nbudget-cutting by the Administration could easily<br />\ndestroy a project like Head Start.<br />\nSkeptical of White Society<br />\nThe fact that a change in Administrations or Congress<br />\ncan cripple the fight against poverty in this country is<br />\none of the reasons why ghetto residents remain quite<br />\nskeptical of government and white society. .<br />\nWhen the Community Action program was first<br />\ndeveloped, it was hoped that the organization and<br />\n\"maximum feasible participation\" of the poor would<br />\nenable them to put pressure on city government, and<br />\nwork needed changes in existing institutions.<br />\nThe Model Cities program, and a part of the<br />\nCommunity Action effort, were designed to provide<br />\nservices and training to inner-city residents,<br />\n<br />\nmiNEN\u2022NER\"A happy morality which says,<br />\nLEVERING HALL<br />\nthat goodness is a fine thing,<br />\nPresents<br />\nbut badness is fun, too!\"<br />\n-Wash.Post<br />\n<br />\nUpWith Davey!<br />\nTHE MIRISCh CORPORATION presents<br />\n<br />\nA JOHN HUSTON- WALTER MIRISCH<br />\nPRODUCTION<br />\n<br />\nThe Nixon Administration, with the advice of Daniel<br />\nMoynihan, seems to favor a plan of building income,<br />\nthrough tax reform, and possibly an income<br />\nredistribution scheme.<br />\nEach of these methods is a potentially beneficial way<br />\nof providing things for people who have very little. At<br />\nthe same time, the poverty problem in this country can<br />\nonly be solved with a national commitment that involves<br />\nboth money and the use of all three means.<br />\nIf city agencies aren't doing the job necessary for the<br />\nghetto, then they must be pushed to do it.

I<br />\npersonallysee no reason \u2014 financial or<br />\notherwise \u2014 for the University to make<br />\nthis cutback. Last Monday night, all the<br />\ncoaches (full and part-time) plus a student<br />\nrepresentative from each of the sports<br />\ngathered with Deans Kimball and Bilgrave.,<br />\nand Marshall Turner to discuss the<br />\nany<br />\nup<br />\nclear<br />\nand<br />\nsituation<br />\nmisunderstandings that the recent budget<br />\ncontroversy might have brought out into<br />\nthe open. The basic idea of a meeting was<br />\na good one even though nothing<br />\nconclusive was decided.<br />\nNeither Dean Kimball's position, nor that of<br />\nDr. Gordon, was irrevocable, as proven by last<br />\nweek'sdecisions and Monday night's statements<br />\nto reconsider the wisdom of dropping the five<br />\nsports. This is a step in the right direction, but<br />\nwe, the students will not be satisfied until these<br />\nlive sports are fully reinstated, without jeopardy<br />\nto the rest of the athletic budget or the<br />\nintercollegiate program.<br />\nAt campuses around the country, the term<br />\n\"non-negotiable demands\" is often bantered<br />\naround. Perhaps, the connotations of this term'<br />\nare bad, but the conviction it conveys is not.<br />\nReinstatement of the five sports is a<br />\nnon-negotiable demand. The question of how the<br />\nfinancial arrangements should be made to keep<br />\nthese live sports on the field is a little more open<br />\nto discussion.<br />\nWhere's the Money?<br />\nAt Monday's meeting the question \"Where will<br />\nwe get the money from?\" was raised. First of all,<br />\nthe financial responsibility rests with the\u2022<br />\nUniversity. Secondly, it cannot attach an<br />\nextra\"tax\" to student tuition bills to make up<br />\nthe $15,000 or so needed to keep the five sports.<br />\nThe Hopkins fund, in association with the<br />\nAlumni Association, should and must undertake<br />\na fund-raising drive to get, in the-words of Coach<br />\nSot ii', \"the Athletic Department out of the hole<br />\nand back on ground level.\" Sotir's analogy<br />\nbrought this comment from the back of the<br />\nroom: \"A hole? It's a canyon!\"<br />\nOvernight Improvements Possible<br />\nWe do not agree Ixith the opinion that<br />\novernight improvements are not possible. The<br />\noriginal budget submitted by Marshall Turner<br />\nwhich asked for $300,000(approximately a 50%<br />\nincrease over this year's sub-marginal $202,000)<br />\nwas an honest one with \"no padding\". The large<br />\nincrease is not a reflection of wild spending by<br />\nthe Athletic Department, but rather a reflection<br />\nof the University's miserly 30-year old policy<br />\ntowards the needs of the Athletic Department.<br />\nThis has to be changed \u2014 now. Equipment<br />\ninventories are at the zero-level, and despite a<br />\nraise in the pay-scale for next year, salaries are<br />\nnot on much of a competitive basis with even the<br />\npublic high schools. Come on, Dr. Gordon, et.<br />\nal., this is college. You know, the big time.<br />\nMickey Webster Speaks<br />\nMickey Webster (Hopkins '59) from the<br />\nAlumni Association put the situation in its<br />\nproper perspective when he stated that the basic<br />\npurpose of the University is \"the development of<br />\npeople.\" Moreover, the shortsighted policy od<br />\ndropping the five sports will in the long run cut<br />\ndown on the' increase of Alumni contributions,<br />\nfor in Webster's words.\"the greatest proportion<br />\nof money-givers are jocks\". Another point made<br />\nwas that the University might, if it isn't careful,<br />\nfind itself in a position comparable to the one at<br />\nUniversity of Chicago.<br />\nIf these five sports are dropped, the University<br />\nis reducing the possibility that these 112 students<br />\n,and all possible future participants in these sports<br />\n<br />\n\u2022\u2022<br />\n\u2022 41<br />\n<br />\nmight give money to the University. Now, we ask<br />\nyou administration, Dean Kimball on up, is this<br />\nwise? Stop and consider the longterm effects of<br />\nyour actions. Is $15,000 worth the alienation of<br />\nso many future alumni?<br />\nThe meeting adjourned with the consensus<br />\nthat Dean Kimball would work in \"good faith\"<br />\nto investigate what kind of sources could be used<br />\nto find the -money to run the five sports plus<br />\nupgrade the Athletic Department's financial<br />\nsituation. We hope that this faith is not betrayed.<br />\nFinancial Studies<br />\ntogether by Turner and<br />\npulled<br />\nstudy<br />\nA<br />\nBilgrave in the summer and fall of 1967 shows<br />\nthe deplorable status of athletics at Hopkins. The<br />\nsurvey was to be for the basis of a committee to<br />\ninvestigate the Physical Education Program. The<br />\nidea of the Committee was recommended by Mr.<br />\nTurner in the spring of 1967. Quick to respond<br />\nto the needs of the students, Dr. Gordon set up<br />\nthe committee in the fall of 1968.<br />\nFrom the 16 college study, which included<br />\nsuch schools as R.P.I., F&M, Mit, Rutgers,<br />\nWesleyan, Harvard, Yale and Princeton, certain<br />\ntelling figures were discovered. Based on the<br />\n1966-67 athletic budget figures and a student<br />\nenrollment of 1850, it was found that Hopkins<br />\nspent $96 per student in the athletic area. This<br />\nwas the lowest figure of all the schools studied,<br />\nalthough R.P.I. was close with $97 per student.<br />\nIvies Spend More<br />\nAlthough the figures could not be \"100%<br />\naccurate\" due to different budgetary systems<br />\nused, by and large this is a \"true survey\" as<br />\ncorresponding categories were matched up as<br />\nefficiently as possible. Comparatively speaking,<br />\nlittle Wesleyan spent $229 per student, while the<br />\nIvies spent even more,(Harvard $342, Yale $330,<br />\nPrinceton $285).<br />\nThe proposed minimal $245,000 budget will<br />\nspend a little less than $126 per student which is<br />\nstill way short of Turner's and Bilgrave's 1967<br />\nestimate that it would take $170 per student to<br />\nrun a first-class operation. Presently Mr. Bilgrave<br />\ncommittee's<br />\nhis<br />\nwith<br />\naccord<br />\nin<br />\nis<br />\nrecommendation for the University to spend<br />\napproximately $157 per student, (this figure is<br />\nderived from the optimum $300,000 budget first<br />\nsubmitted to Dean Kimball). In light of this, it is<br />\nobvious that even with the proposed dropping of<br />\nthe five sports, the Athletic Program will not be<br />\nrun on a first class basis.<br />\nFind the Money<br />\nTherefore, in conclusion, we urge Dr. Gordon<br />\nrun<br />\nand his Administration to find the money to<br />\npolicy<br />\na first-class operation.

MAY 9, 1969<br />\n<br />\nNEWS\u2014LETTER<br />\n<br />\nPAGE 15<br />\n<br />\niLosing Hopkins Baseball Team Exciting B.I.A. Notes<br />\nBy RICK APPEL<br />\nWith the season drawing quickly to a<br />\nClose, the Hopkins varsity baseball team<br />\nIs currently enduring a 3-6-1 overall<br />\nrecord.<br />\nThey are presently in the midst of a<br />\nfour game losing streak, including a<br />\ndouble loss to Western Maryland, and<br />\nsingle losses to Gettysburg and<br />\nWashington College.<br />\nThere is more to this ball club than<br />\nlosing, however. The team can no longer<br />\nbe taken lightly, as it has been in the<br />\nPast. The team has become more<br />\nexciting, and boasts an average of five<br />\nruns per game.<br />\nWhether this can be attributed to the<br />\nnew uniforms, the snow fence which<br />\nmakes home runs possible, or the good<br />\nCondition of the baseball field, cannot<br />\nbe said. But the excitement is there. The<br />\nPlayers are cracking the ball.<br />\nLacks Personnel<br />\nUnfortunately, the team is lacking in<br />\nPersonnel. There is almost no depth on<br />\nthe bench, and, to make matters worse,<br />\nseveral of the starters are weak at their<br />\nPositions.According to head coach Gary<br />\nBarrette, this lack of personnel is the<br />\n<br />\nbiggest problem the team has to face.<br />\nIt has resulted mainly in a<br />\npoor-fielding ball club, which has<br />\nallowed its opposition six runs per<br />\ngame, and has committed twelve errors<br />\nin the last two games. The team can best<br />\nbe<br />\ndescribed<br />\nby<br />\nthe<br />\nterm<br />\n\"inconsistent\".<br />\nOn April 16, the team upset a<br />\nhighly-talented Towson State ball club<br />\nby the score of 3-1. This was only the<br />\nsecond loss of the season for Towson.<br />\nWith a rain-out causing a postponement<br />\nof the Western Maryland doubleheader,<br />\nrescheduling left the club with four<br />\ngames in three days.<br />\nThey defeated PMC by, a score of 7-3<br />\non a big five-run eigth inning. The strain<br />\nof four games in three days took its<br />\neffect on the Hopkins thin pitching<br />\nstaff, as they dropped a double-header<br />\nto a strong Western Maryland ball club<br />\nby scores of 7-3 and 10-1.<br />\nSeven Errors<br />\nWith the Jays leading Gettysburg 2-0,<br />\nthe defense collapsed and committed<br />\nseven errors. Hopkins lost 11-6, with ten<br />\nof Gettysburg's runs unearned.<br />\nThe team then went on the road to<br />\n<br />\nWashington College. Hopkins picked up<br />\na quick 6-0 lead, and still had things<br />\nunder control after the top of the ninth<br />\nwith five runs to defeat an extremely<br />\ndejected Hopkins squad by a score of<br />\n11-10. Five Blue Jay errors in the game<br />\nproved costly.<br />\nThe leading Hopkins hitters are the<br />\ntwo senior co-captains, Jim Zuger and<br />\nChip Breschkin. Zuger, the shortstop, is<br />\nbatting .382 on the season, including<br />\ntwo home runs and ten runs batted in.<br />\nIn addition, he is batting a cool .484 in<br />\nMiddle<br />\nthe<br />\nAtlantic Conference.<br />\nBreschkin, the catcher, is presently<br />\nhitting at .345, with ten RBI's.<br />\nThe pitching burden has been held up<br />\nby senior Hal Thorne whose record<br />\nstands at 1-2, and by junior Rich<br />\nThielke who has a 2-3 mark to his<br />\ncredit. The pitching staff was given a<br />\nsolid blow when lefty sophomore Glenn<br />\nDeuchler hurt his arm in the<br />\nRandolph-Macon game, and hasn't<br />\npitched since.<br />\nThis team deserves more than they<br />\nhave achieved. They have been scoring<br />\nruns, but giving up too many. They are<br />\ninexperienced in some areas, lacking in<br />\nothers. They do have potential.<br />\n<br />\nBy DAVE WIEDNER<br />\nWith the close of an abbreviated<br />\nspring intramural season drawing near,<br />\nthere seems little to debate over the<br />\nrepresentatives of each division in the<br />\nplay-offs. Gam (4-0) will certainly<br />\nrepresent the Canterbury division in<br />\nlacrosse as its balanced attack produced<br />\nvictories over its toughest competitors,<br />\nBeta, DU, and TEP, within the same<br />\nweek. TEP (4-1) assured its place in the<br />\nsemifinals as its goalie, Bill Bosch, shut<br />\nout contender ATO,4-0.<br />\nCompetition is keener in the<br />\nSouthern<br />\nand<br />\nCharles Divisions.<br />\nHowever, Sig Ep (3-1)seems destined to<br />\nmaintain its one-game advantage over<br />\nZBT. This week, Sig Ep nudged by<br />\nwinless Phi Ep on the merits of Bill<br />\nHarlow's one goal while Harry Snyder's<br />\nfour second-half goals allowed ZBT to<br />\nget by similarly winless Phi Sig.<br />\nIn the Southern Division, AEPi (4-0)<br />\nprovided itself with a half-game lead<br />\nover KA by drowning them 9-8. Later<br />\nAEPi gained a victory through 1.<br />\n\u2022 forfeiture by AD, but KA remained<br />\nclose by lashing Sigma NU 8-1 under the<br />\nwhip of Tom McElroy's five goals.<br />\n<br />\notley<br />\nshmotley<br />\nds<br />\nlong<br />\nds,<br />\n<br />\nyou re<br />\nhaving<br />\nFun<br />\n<br />\ncol<br />\nUMBIA PICTURES and<br />\nCARL FOREMAN Present<br />\n<br />\nTOM COEDAY<br />\nUPSON\\EIE<br />\nin BRUCE<br />\n<br />\nCPOR:UCTION<br />\nIn thi.lieadd Cilar1es'\\114\u2014<br />\n<br />\ntapbouge<br />\n<br />\n2.4 6 8,10<br />\nXiie<br />\nit4 25th at Charles 1235-04301<br />\n.41mmir<br />\n<br />\nHopkins students, new and old, eat at<br />\n<br />\nPecora's Restaurant<br />\n<br />\n011f'<br />\nN.ej<br />\n<br />\nfor the finest italian food in town<br />\n<br />\n.\\\\\u20183<br />\n<br />\n3320 Greenmount Ave.<br />\n<br />\n1111<br />\n<br />\nIl'AOHETTI MEALS<br />\nilIZZA PIE A SPECIALTY<br />\n<br />\n3111<br />\n<br />\nCARRY OUT SERVICE<br />\nCALL S119-31131<br />\nAnNIM<br />\n<br />\nRE CATHOLIC COMMUNITY<br />\nON CAMPUS<br />\n<br />\n5011<br />\n<br />\neel] Nday, May 11th, 10:30 AN<br />\nShaffer 3<br />\n<br />\n3<br />\n<br />\n,ITURGY FOR SPRING<br />\nv ilm:\"CHOMOPHOBIA\"<br />\nhiursday,May 15th,12:10 PM<br />\nShaffer 3<br />\nASCENSION<br />\nPip014SS FOR<br />\ncut'<br />\n<br />\nI:: A<br />\n<br />\nTHURSDAY<br />\no y Day of Obligation<br />\n<br />\nHail!

Since that time, the<br />\nletter has been read publicly and revealed to<br />\nmany of its author's colleagues.<br />\nNo Publicity<br />\nThe professor who wrote the letter strongly<br />\noPPosed any publicity over it and the reaction<br />\nto it.

A disagreement with a student<br />\nover a moral issue, stated the letter, would not<br />\naffect that student's grades within the<br />\ndepartment. However, the letter continued,\"My<br />\n\u00b0Pinion of an indivual's respect for the nature of<br />\nan academic community is, I am bound to say,<br />\n\u00b0Re of the most important of my opinions<br />\nregarding him as a teacher.\"<br />\nThe professor declined to comment on any<br />\nPart of the letter's contents or on any reactions<br /><br />\nhe had received to it.

Mann, Professor<br />\nof Education. Dr. Mann stressed that those<br />\npresent should draw their own conclusions from.<br />\nthe text of the letter, in contrast to an SDS<br />\nmember who presented it as a \"Piece of<br />\nacademic blackmail,\"<br />\nAfter reading the letter, Dr. Mann added \"as a<br />\nmember of the Johns Hopkins faculty, I am<br />\nprofoundly ashamed of this letter.\" He<br />\ncontinued, saying \"I will not reveal who wrote<br />\nthis letter, but I urge him to come forth and<br />\njustify this to his students and to the entire<br />\ncommunity.\"<br />\nThe graduate students of the Philosophy<br />\nDepartment intend to meet today to discuss the<br />\nletter and get clarification on delicate points<br />\nfrom its author. The consensus of the graduate<br />\nstudents who were interviewed by the<br />\nNews-Letter was that the letter was ambiguous.<br />\nThe matter was so complex, they contended,<br />\nthat \"a few anonymous quotes won't reveal the<br />\nfeeling in the Department.\"<br /><br />\nMany of the letter's critics refer to it .as an'<br />\nattempt to coerce the students into a certain<br />\nposition on moral issues. If this is the case, they<br />\ncontend, the author of the letter has exceeded<br />\nhis rights and academic prerogatives.<br />\nHowever, many make it clear that this is not<br />\nan isolated case. According to Dr. Stephen<br />\nAmbrose, Professor of History, there have b9en<br />\nmany such cases as this in the last five years. In<br />\nmost of these cases, however, knowledge of the<br />\nattempt to sway moral stands or opinions has<br />\nnever left the confines of the department.<br /><br />\nDR STEVEN MANN is reading the letter of an unindentified<br />\nPic by Lemm<br />\nfaculty member at last Tuesday's teach-in.<br /><br />\nMandel Signs ConstitutiDnally Dubious Drug Bill<br />\nBy DAVE MELAMED<br /><br />\nGOVERNOR MARVIN MANDEL appears uncertain about his<br />\nstand on illegal drugs.<br /><br />\nA bill which provides for incarceration for<br />\n\"unspecified periods\" up to seven years of<br />\nany person exhibiting the symptoms of \"physical<br />\nand psychological dependence\" on any illegal<br />\ndrug was signed into law last week by Governor<br />\nMarvin Mandel.<br />\nEntitled the \"Comprehensive Drug Abuse<br />\nControl and Rehabilitation Act,\" the law<br />\nempowers parents, relatives, \"or anyone residing<br />\nin the same house of an alleged addict\" to<br />\n\"apply for an order certifying such person to the<br />\ncare and custody of authority.\"<br />\nOnce such application has been made, a court<br />\norder issued under the new law shall \"direct the<br />\nalleged drug addict to appear at a specified time<br />\nbefore the court for a determination whether<br />\nthere are reasonable grounds to order him to<br />\nundergo a medical examiniation at a facility<br />\ndesignated by the authority.\"<br />\nA Warrant<br />\n\"If the alleged drug addict does not comply<br />\nwith such order, the court shall issue A<br />\nWARRANT and shall direct any peace officer or<br />\npolice officer in the State to take the alleged<br />\ndrug addict into custody,\" states section 9 (B)<br />\n(4) of the law.<br /><br />\nMandel's action came just three weeks before<br />\na blue-ribbon gubernatorial commission on drugs<br />\nwas due to release its findings.

The<br />\nDepartment of Defense was second,<br />\n\u2014 contracting out $3.4 million worth of<br />\nresearch to the University followed by<br />\n$2.4 million from the National Science<br />\nFoundation.<br />\nThe officer for sponsored research on<br />\nthe Homewood campus, Donald<br />\nMcLeod, said, on an inquiry if the<br />\nresearch for DOD was related to the war<br />\neffort,that \"anything you do can be<br />\nremotely tied to weaponry.\" He<br />\nexplained', though, that research<br />\nconsidered to be related to defense<br />\nwould usually be under the title of<br />\nclassified reseatch and must be dpproved<br />\nby an ad hoc faculty committee.<br />\nMulti-Step Process<br />\nDean Kimball said that the normal<br />\nprocedure for granting research projects<br />\nfor individual professors required<br />\napproval<br />\nfrom<br />\nthe<br />\nprofessor's<br />\ndepartment chairman, Kimball as Dean<br />\nof Arts and Sciences and the Institute of<br />\nSponsored Research. After that, the<br />\ncontractor will negotiate the details of<br />\nthe project directly with the ISR.<br />\nHowever, on classified contracts<br />\nKimball asserted that a faculty<br /><br />\ncommittee considered all proposals and<br />\nthe limitations they may impose on the<br />\nUniversity. In fact, though, he said, no<br />\nclassified research has been approved for<br />\na number of years.<br />\nthe<br />\nBesides<br />\ndown<br />\ncutting<br />\nbureaucratic tape, the establishment of<br />\nthe Institute of Sponsored Research<br />\ndesignated outside researchers required<br />\nfor a project under the titles of Research<br />\nScientist,Associate Research Scientist and<br />\nResearch Assisitant. All these posts deal<br />\nin research requiring no teaching<br />\nresponsibilities.<br />\nHowever, McLeod<br />\ncharacterized these posts as a sometimes<br />\na \"backdoor\" way to appoint a<br />\nresearcher to a tenured position as a<br />\nprofessor.<br />\nBackdoor Man<br />\nEspecially before the Institute lost its<br />\nold freedom from the administration,<br />\nMcLeod rememberd, a highly regarded<br />\nteaching<br />\nresearcher<br />\npoor<br />\nwith<br />\ncredentials could be enticed to Hopkins<br />\nby a lucrative research grant and then<br />\nthrough the \"backdoor\" of subsequent<br />\ngrants slowly placed in the position for<br />\na professorial position.<br />\nConcerning the Defense Department<br />\ngrants, all come through the divisions of<br />\nNavy, Army and Air Force. Three<br />\ndepartments listed as having many<br />\ncontracts with DOD last year were<br />\nBiology, Chemistry and Mechanics. Dr.<br />\nWilliam McElroy, the chairman of<br />\nBiology, said his department received<br />\nNavy contracts on basic research mainly<br />\nconcerned<br />\nwith<br />\nmarine biologY\u2022<br />\nMcElroy said no contracts dealt with<br />\ndefense<br />\nprojects. The Chemistry<br />\ndepartment head, Dr. Walter Koski, said<br />\nhis department dealt in Army contracts<br />\nof basic research. \"We have no applied<br />\nresearch or classified research,\" Koski<br />\nstated.<br />\nGrants vs. Contracts<br />\nMcLeod distinguished between grants<br />\nand contracts. Grants, he said, contain<br />\nno legal obligation that the project will<br />\nyield any tangible results. However, a<br />\ncontractual agreement requires that a<br />\nfirm product emerged from the research<br />\nconducted.<br />\nThe ISR officer said Hopkins has one<br />\nof the most liberal and thorough<br />\nresearch administrations in the country,<br />\nwhich has helped attract both manY<br />\ngrants and well-known researchers.<br />\n\"Princeton, for example, has a<br />\ncommittee which holds every research<br />\nproject for 6 weeks,\" he said \"This<br />\nmany times causes a project to miss the<br />\napplication deadline.\"<br />\nAlso, the Institute officer stated that<br />\nthe reputation and interests of Hopkins<br />\nalways comes before any individual<br />\nprofessor. \"If it is believed that a grant<br />\nrestricts the University, or for other<br />\nreasons harmful, the proposal will not<br />\nbe approved,\" he said. About 1 per cent<br />\nof research grants or contracts are<br />\nconducted by a Hopkins professor<br />\noutside the Institute of Sponsored<br />\nResearch's control, he noted.<br />\nMcLeod stated that the change from<br />\na Cooperative to a Sponsored Institute<br />\nmade it a more integral part of the<br />\nadministration.<br /><br />\nHigh Schoolers Get Lectured<br />\nHopkins is currently<br />\noffering<br />\nBaltimore area high school students a<br />\nlecture series in the field of<br />\nInternational Relations featuring Dr.<br />\nLincoln Gordon as a speaker.<br />\nInternational Relations is the theme<br />\nof this year's High School Lecture<br />\nSeries, annually \"offered in an effort to<br />\nprovide services to the community,\"<br />\naccording to Victor Dates, Director of<br />\nSpecial Events at Hopkins.<br />\nThe three previous lecture series have<br />\ncovered topics in biology, history and<br />\n\u2014 English.<br />\nThis year's series was begun by Dr.<br />\nIsiah Frank, Clayton Professor of<br /><br />\nInternational Economics at the School<br />\nof Advanced International Studies<br />\n(SAIS) in Washington.

If there is any<br />\ndirection in which we're headed around here, there's got<br />\nto be communication.\" Faxon believed that any group<br />\nrepresenting students on the campus should be able to<br />\nspeak with President Gordon directly, and not through<br />\nintermediaries. Ile was referring to SDS-NUC demands<br />\nto speak with the President. The demands led to the<br />\nHomewood sit-in this week.<br /><br />\nDean Rudoy, while agreeing that the<br />\nadministration hact over-reacted to the sit-in on Tuesday,<br />\nstated that there are established methods for student<br />\ngroups to gain access to Dr. Gordon.\"The unwillingness<br />\nof these two groups to communicate their feelings to the<br />\nadministraton through legitimate channels\u2014proven to be<br />\neffective\u2014seems to be indicative of their unwillingness to<br />\ncommunicate,\" said Rudoy in a resolution that will be<br />\nsubmitted to the Council on Monday. Rudoy explained<br />\nthat he felt SDS-NUC wanted a confrontation instead of<br />\nmeaningful discussions with the Presidpnt.<br />\nRadical Rodriguez<br />\nS.C. Vice-President Manuel Rodriguez criticized<br />\nthe administration attempt to evict the students from<br />\nHomewood House in another resolution to be placed<br />\nbefore the Council Monday. \"In light of the facts<br />\navailable to me, I deplore the administration's<br />\nover-reaction and threat of 'suspension and appropriate<br /><br />\nTwo Groups Circulate Anti-SDS Petitions<br />\nBy RICHARD HEDDLESON<br />\nIn response to the sit-in last Tuesday at<br />\nHomewood House, two student groups have<br />\ncirculated petitions which condemn the use of<br />\nviolence and \"outside agitators\" to further<br />\nstudent demands.<br />\nThe first petitions is being promoted by three<br />\nresidents of Gildersleeve House, in the freshman dorms.<br />\nThe petition \"deplores the forceful entry and use of<br />\noutside agitators by the SDS and the NUC.\" The<br />\nfreshmen spearheading this petition are Bill Strisever,<br />\nRichard McKenna and Wayne Matus. They decided to<br />\ncirculate the petition .after \\ a group of ten or so got<br />\ntogether and talked about our extreme dislike for the<br />\ntactics being used by the SDS,\" according to McKenna.<br />\n\"Initiation of Force\"<br />\nThe other petition is being circulated under the<br />\ndirection of upperclassmen Bill Van Doren, Michael<br />\nMarcus and Laurence Shatkin. It states that the<br />\n\"University should neither recognize nor negotiate with<br />\nany group that uses the initiation of force.\" It also asks<br />\nthe University to state that it will protect members of<br />\nthe community from coercive violence and to stop \"any<br />\nfuture occupation of university property by whatever<br />\nlegitimate means are necessary.\" Further, it calls for the<br />\npunishment of acts of violence and coercion and the<br />\nexpulsion of repeated offenders.<br />\nUnlike the freshman petition, the upperclass<br />\npetition is not a spontaneous reaction to the Tuesday<br />\nsit-in. \"We made provisions to take actions like this four<br />\nmonths ago,\" stated Van Doren. The students had<br />\npreviously organized an ad hoc Committee Against<br />\nStudent Terrorism. Van Doren said that the committee<br />\nmay also issue a position paper on ROTC. He was also<br />\ncritical of President Gordon. He said, \"Dr. Gordon<br />\nshould have been more forthright in expressing his<br />\nopinions. We would advocate a more unequivocal<br />\nstand.\"<br />\n\"Better Picture\"<br />\nMcKenna said that the purpose of the freshman<br />\npetition was to \"give Dr. Gordon a better picture of<br />\nstudent feeling and display support for him and extreme<br /><br />\ndislike for the tactics used (by:SDS).\" McKenna said his<br />\ngroup planned to present the petition to Dr. Gordomat<br />\nnext week's convocation.<br />\nVan Doren's group \"does not necessarily support<br />\nprevious positions of Dr. Gordon.\" In fact, Van Doren<br />\n\"would have approved of having police brought onto the<br />\ncampus.<br />\nSteve Shriver of SDS said that 'the whole thing<br />\n(the Homewood House sit-in) was non-violent and there<br />\nwas no forced entry.\" Matus, one of the proponents of<br />\nthe freshman petition, defined forced entry as \"going in<br />\nsome place where you just aren't particularly wanted.\"<br /><br />\naction,'\" declared Rodriguez. \"While not in full<br />\nagreement with the general SDS-NUC tactics and goals,<br />\nsupport their demand for an open convocation and in<br />\nairing of the fact: regarding the militarization of<br />\nHopkins.\"<br />\nMost of the m;mbers of the Student Council said<br />\nthe proper channel for student inputs was the S.C.<br />\nPresident Russ Passarella explained that Dr. Gordon<br />\nrecognizes the S.C. as the \\ representative student organ.<br />\nPassarella and Rudoy believed the SDS-NUC should first<br />\nhave consulted with the Student Council before<br />\ndemanding that the President answer them.<br />\nRodriguez disagreed, saying that there should be a<br />\nbetter system whereby student groups can speak direcdY<br />\nwith the President, and he supported the claim of the<br />\nSDS-NUC that Gordon should have directly answered<br />\ntheir letters and met with them. _<br />\nRuss Passarella agreed with other members that<br />\nthe S.C. should develop closer contacts with the<br />\nAcademic Council. He and the other members present<br />\nstated unanimously that every student crisis this Year<br />\nhas been solved only after students threatened a<br />\nconfrontation.<br />\n\"Arrogant and Insulting\"<br />\nOn Tuesday, Dr. Gordon called the SDS-NUC<br />\ndemands \"arrogant and insulting.\" He told the<br />\nNews-Letter Wednesday that he was not prepared to<br />\nmeet with the SDS-NUC. Hedialso said he found the<br />\nHomewood sit-in \"a discourtesy,\" and a personal affront<br />\nto Vice-President William Bevan. Gordon said Bevan was<br />\ninstructed to listen to the demands and report the\u00b0,<br />\nback to him. He stated that the students' refusal to tai\"<br />\nto Bevan was a \"personal insult\" to the Vice President,<br /><br />\nSDS Claims Demonstration Victory<br />\nDespite the vociferous student support of<br />\nPresident Gordon during Tuesday's open<br />\nmeeting in front of Homewood House, both<br />\nSDS and NUC leaders claimed a \"significant\"<br />\nvictory in their anti-ROTC demonstration.<br />\nPointing to the fact that Dr. Gordon had returned to<br />\nHomewood House after declaring that the\"convocation\"<br />\nwould be held at Levering, and adding that all but one of<br />\nthe original SDS objectives had been achieved, SDS<br />\nclaimed Tuesday's actions succesful.<br />\n\"Clashes Inevitable\"<br />\n\"First of all, and this is most important,\" stated<br />\nStephen Shriver, an SDS leader,\"is the fact that we<br />\nraised the issues. What had originally been obscured has<br />\nnow been brought out into the open.\" Admitting that<br />\nhostility, too, had increased during the afternoon, he<br />\nclaimed that \"a polarizing effect is inevitable in clashes<br />\nof this sort.\"<br />\nThe second major point, which was brought out in an<br />\nSDS-NUC post-demonstration meeting, was that the<br />\ndemands were not rejected, nor were the original aims<br />\nthwarted. \"We accomplished everything we set out to<br />\naccomplish,\" claimed Bob Paskoff, another SDS<br />\nleader,\"except for eliciting a statement on militarism at<br />\nHopkins.\" Even this, declared Shriver, is an admission of<br />\nsorts, for \"it shows that the Administration cannot<br />\ncommit itself to an open community.\"<br />\n.r<br /><br />\n\u2022<br /><br />\n4ko<br /><br />\nThe objectives which SDS-NUC claimed were<br />\nsuccessfully carried out included the handing over of the<br />\nanti-ROTC petitions to Dr. Gordon, the agreement 00<br />\nthe part of the administration to the holding of an ope\u00b0<br />\nconvocation with an open microphone in the netari<br />\nfuture, and the statement by Dr. Gordon that he woui.'\"<br />\nbring up the three original SDS demands in et,<br />\nAcademic Council.

It is very<br />\npossible that after his commission<br />\nmakes its report May 22 \u2014 a report<br />\nWhich will almost certainly recommend<br />\nrevision \u2014 the Governor will rely on the<br />\nfact that the schools and colleges where<br />\nClamor for revision is strongest will be<br />\nout the summer recess.

He.<br />\nis courting the Baltimore medical<br />\nMaryland<br />\nestablishment, as any<br />\npolitician has to.<br />\nThere is serious question about the<br />\nconstitutionality of the new law, which<br />\nhas been portrayed as a \"liberalization\"<br />\nbut which in fact is unliberal. The bill<br />\ndid not pass through routine General<br />\nAssembly channels, and it looks like it \u2014<br />\nalmost nobody in Annapolis has even<br />\nread it and very few know what it says.<br />\nSeveral legislators refused to be<br />\nco-sponsors of it because of the<br />\nquestionable constitutionality. It was<br />\nintroduced late in the last-minute rush<br />\nof the last session, by the son of a<br />\nBaltimore judge. The old man wrote it,<br />\nand the son hustled it through to<br />\npassage.<br />\nFirst, the law applies to \"drug<br />\naddiction,\" but includes in its provisions<br />\n. the use of marijuana and any other<br />\nsubstances which may,in other places in<br />\nthe body of law of this State, be later<br />\ndetermined to be \"dangerous,\" whether<br />\naddicting or not.<br /><br />\nany person related to the suspected<br />\naddict, or that failing, anybody who<br />\nlives in the same house.<br />\nIf found not be be an addict within<br />\nthe meaning of the law, the person is<br />\nreturned to the judge who may still use<br />\nhis offices to \"cure\" the anti-social<br />\nbehavior which brought the person to<br />\nhis attention in the first place.<br />\nThe persons suspected may appeal at<br />\nevery stage, but if he is under 21 most<br />\nof the important documents regarding<br />\nhis case are only available to his parents,<br />\nwho may be the ones who turned him in<br />\nthe first place. Any chance of<br />\nprosecuting a successful appeal, already<br />\nrare, are rendered hypothetical.<br />\nVisualize a kid 16 or 17 who is<br />\nintelligent but who lacks motivation in<br />\nschool and is uncommunicative with his<br />\nparents. Finally, in desperation one<br />\nnight following an especially hostile<br />\nevening meal the parents approach a<br />\njudge for advice. He asks if the kid is<br />\nlethargic or introspective. On the basis<br />\nof the parents' answers, he orders the<br />\nkid for treatment. He tells the parents<br />\n\"It's all for the best.\"<br /><br />\nSecond, it defines addicts so loosely<br />\nthat almost anyone can be made to fit<br />\nthe definition. For example, a drug<br />\naddict is any \"person exhibiting the<br />\nsymptoms of drug addiction;\" or<br />\nsomebody \"in imminent danger od<br />\nbecoming addicted.\" Under this<br />\ndefinition it is easy to see that, relying<br />\non the old saw that marijuana use leads<br />\nto herein addiction, any user of<br />\nmajijuana is in imminent danger of<br />\nbecoming an addict.<br />\nAfter identifying a possible addict<br />\nunder the new law, he is brought before<br />\na judge. The judge may find him to be<br />\nan addict within the meaning of the law<br />\nand order him incarcerated for<br />\ntreatment for up to seven years,<br />\nalthough he has to renew his order every<br />\nyear.<br />\nIf the judge believes the addict is not<br />\nlikely to report for treatment, he can<br />\nplace him in custody for delivery to<br />\ntreatment.

The letter informed the students that the author would not<br />\nwrite letters of recommendation for any student who participated in a<br />\nviolent or unruly demonstration.<br />\nThe professor justified his decision, stating that the way in which a<br />\nstudent construes the institution and his academic environment is an<br />\nimportant criterion for judging the student as a future teacher. What was<br />\nimplicit was the premise that any student who has participated in a violent<br />\nor unruly demonstration did not possess a proper or correct view of his<br />\nacademic environment. To this point, though there is heated argument in<br />\nmany circles concerning the letter, the professor has declined to publicly<br />\nacknowledge his authorship, to amplify or further define any of the<br />\nletter's statements; indeed, to acknowledge any public responsibility for<br />\nthe content of the letter at all.<br />\nWhen Dr. Mann read a copy of the letter to the crowd at Tuesday's<br />\nrally, however, the contents of the letter became almost common<br />\nnot<br />\nknowledge. Although the name of the faculty member-author was<br />\nthe<br />\nof<br />\nidentity<br />\nthe<br />\ntogether<br />\npiece<br />\nto<br />\nenough<br />\neasy<br />\nrevealed, people found it<br />\nhis<br />\nd<br />\nemploye<br />\nprofessor<br />\nthe<br />\nthat<br />\nfact<br />\nthe<br />\nis<br />\nevident<br />\nauthor. Equally<br />\nmoral<br />\nthe<br />\ninhibit<br />\nacademic position and prestige to covertly influence and<br />\nand social beliefs of his students.<br />\nMoreover, the letter, unsupplemented by conversation as it is, leaves<br />\nunclear the definitions of \"violent\" and \"participation.\" These two words,<br />\nobviously keys to understanding the letter's warning, remain undefined so<br />\nthat the letter, on the whole, is subject to a wide range of interpretation.<br />\nBy refusing to discuss the matter further, the professor has insured that<br />\nnot even those over whom he wields his power understand that which<br />\nthey must do (or not do) to escape.<br />\nThe faculty member who sent copies of this letter to the graduate<br />\nstudents has obviously overstrode his rightful prerogatives and the line<br />\nwhich divides respect for a professor from complete surrender of one's<br />\nown freedom of action and coice. Like Dr. Mann, we are ashamed that<br />\n, we<br />\nsuch examples of coercion are to be found on this campus. However<br />\nsuch<br />\nthat<br />\nmembers<br />\nfaculty<br />\nof<br />\nhave not found surprising the statements<br />\nfrom<br />\ncoercion is a more common fact in Hopkins than one would suspect<br />\ncalm.<br />\nthe departments' outer<br />\nis<br />\nThere is much at Hopkins which a student cannot hope to see.

The fact that such<br />\nmuch<br />\nindicates<br />\naction could remain unchallenged for nearly three weeks<br />\nabout the lack of respect that the students have for themselves.

In signing House Bill number 1257 into law, he has added another<br />\nblack mark to an already unimpressive public record. This time, moreover,<br />\nhis actions go past the inequitable to the unconstitutional.<br />\nLeaving questions of legality to the courts, however, the bill may (and,<br />\nin one respect does) have serious repercussions on campus. The bill, the<br />\nComprehensive Drug Abuse Control and Rehabilitation Act, calls for the<br />\nmandatory appearance in court of an alleged addict on the strength of an<br />\norder signed by a parent, relative, or anyone living in the same house as<br />\nthe addict. For Hopkins students both on and off campus, this means<br />\none's roommate.<br />\nNot only can court-ordered incarceration last up to seven years,- but the<br />\nother provisions of the law are equally harsh: refusal to show up in court<br />\nresults in a warrant for arrest, and escape from a rehabilitation center is a<br />\nfelony. Furthermore, the decision is made by a judge, not a doctor, and<br />\nnowhere does the procedure involve the use of a jury: All this, it must be<br />\nremembered, takes place without the commission of a crime.<br />\nThe bill's backers claim it to be liberal, pointing to its rehabilitative<br />\nprovisions, and claim it to be necessary, citing figures on drug-related<br />\ncrimes. What they ignore is the fact that the term \"addict\" is so loosely<br />\ndefined that it renders the concept of \"addiction\" meaningless.<br />\nFurthermore, one need only be \"in danger of becoming an addict\" to fall<br />\nunder the provisos of the law. Conceivably, one who is considering<br />\nsmoking marijuana could be acted against as an addict.<br />\nThe other point is that Mr. Mandel's actions clearly violate his pledge<br />\nto the signers of last Thursday's Open Letter to look into their complaints<br />\nafter the Blue Ribbon Committee submits its report on drug abuse on May<br />\n22. There is no indication that Mr. Mandel is in the least concerned with<br />\nthe difference between cannabis and heroin, nor for that matter, with the<br />\nviews of the President and the students of Johns Hopkins, and the other<br />\nnotables who signed that statement.<br />\nWe, unfortunately, are quite concerned about him.<br /><br />\nAMP -THAT<br />\nAioeK.<br /><br />\nSo I -icor<br />\nSPEW -ro<br />\nSOLVE MY<br /><br />\nPROOLCHs-<br /><br />\nVM<br />\nA<br />\nHAVEMELA)<br />\n10-10/.6<br />\nST<br />\n7t2081.OFE4s.<br /><br />\n-NT<br />\nAIXPIPNT<br />\nWOW<br /><br />\nPAGE 8<br /><br />\nNEWS\u2014LETTER<br /><br />\nHOMEWOOD,BALTIMORE,MAY 9, 1969<br /><br />\nABM Threat Continues to Haunt Congress<br />\nBy SENATOR JOSEPH D. TYDINGS<br />\nSpecial to the News-Letter<br />\nThe Administration's decision to<br />\ndeploy the Safeguard anti-ballistic<br />\nmissile system is one of the most crucial<br />\nmatters to come before Congress in this<br />\ndecade. For there is more at stake than<br />\nan enormously expensive complex of<br />\nmilitary equipment. We are being asked<br />\nto make a decision that could easily<br />\naffect our national security and the<br />\ncourse of the arms race, as well as the<br />\nvery nature of our society in the years<br />\nahead.<br />\nOur defense budget has expanded at<br />\nan incredible rate, to the point where<br />\ndefense-related<br />\nmilitary<br />\nand<br />\nexpenditures consume more than<br />\ntwo-thirds of every American income<br />\ntax dollar. Congressional failure to<br />\ncarefully analyze and evaluate defense<br />\nspending has permitted much waste and<br />\nduplication.<br />\nGiven our unprecedented inflation,<br />\nthe growing burden of the American<br />\ntaxpayer, and the implacable urgency of<br />\nour domestic problems, this \"buy<br />\nwhatever the generals want\" attitude<br />\ntowards military spending is a luxury we<br />\ncan no longer afford.<br />\nBeyond a Certain Point<br />\nThe advance of nuclear weaponry has<br />\nintroduced a new factor into strategic<br />\ncalculus: beyond a certain point<br />\nadditional military appropriations and<br />\nequipment may not be translatable into<br />\nincreased national security or useful<br />\npolitical power. In other words, since<br />\nboth the Soviet Union and the United<br />\nStates have sufficient nuclear power to<br />\nstart a nuclear attack and then to<br />\ndestroy the attackers' society with a<br />\nsecond strike, additional dollars spent<br />\non weapons do not necessarily enhance<br />\nour strength or security.<br />\nIt is within this framework that I<br />\nwould like to discuss the recent decision<br />\nto proceed with the deployment of an<br />\nanti-ballistic missile system.<br />\nLet me begin with a careful<br />\nthe<br />\nDefense<br />\nexamination<br />\nof<br />\nDepartment's reasons for requesting the<br />\nmoney for an ABM system. Though the<br />\njustifications for deploying ABM have<br />\nshifted with the political winds both<br />\nduring this administration and the last,<br />\nSecretary of Defense Laird offered three<br />\nprincipal reasos for constructing the<br />\nSafeguard<br />\nsystem<br />\nduring recent<br />\nCongressional hearings:<br />\nFirst, to defend against a<br />\npossible Chinese nuclear missile<br /><br />\nSENATOR TYDINGS<br />\nattack;<br /><br />\n\u2014Second, to defend against a<br />\n\"light\" irrational or accidental<br />\nattack by the Soviet Union;<br />\n\u2014Third, to protect a portion of<br />\nour offensive missile forces for a<br />\nsecond-strike capability against a<br />\npossible Soviet attempt to develop<br />\npotential to wipe out our<br />\noffensive force through a massive<br />\npreemptive nuclear attack.<br />\nDon't Hold Water<br />\nAt the same time, spokesmen for the<br />\nDefense Department indicated what the<br />\nABM was not supposed to do.<br />\n\u2014First, it was not to be a defense<br />\nof our cities against an all-out<br />\nattack, for this was deemed<br />\nbeyond present technological<br />\ncapabilities;<br />\n\u2014Second, it was not to provoke<br />\nthe Soviets into reacting, thereby<br />\nsetting off another expensive<br />\nround in the arms race;<br />\n\u2014Third, it was not to undermine<br />\nin any way our chances of<br />\nreaching agreements with the<br />\nSoviets on arms control and<br />\nlimitation.<br />\nThese arguments for the ABM simply<br />\ndo not hold water. To begin with, the<br />\ncase made by the Pentagon for the<br />\ndeployment of ABM installations<br />\naround our Minutemen sites in<br />\nMalmstrom, Montana, and Grand Forks,<br />\nNorth<br />\nDakota,<br />\nis<br />\nrife<br />\nwith<br />\ninconsistencies and contradictions.<br />\nIf the Chinese ever chose irrationally<br />\nto attack \u2014 and it should be<br /><br />\nremembered they still do not possess a<br />\ndeliverable nuclear attack capability \u2014 it<br />\nwould surely consist of a suicidal<br />\nnuclear bombardment of our cities, and<br />\nnot a strike against our missile bases.<br />\nFor the Chinese will not have a<br />\nsufficient number of warheads in the<br />\nforseeable future to attempt to destroy<br />\nour second strike capability, that is,<br />\nour ability to absorb a nuclear attack<br />\nwith enough of our missiles intact to<br />\ndevastate China in response.<br />\nThe proposed ABM system is simply<br />\nnot designed to defend cities. The<br />\ncontemplated ABM system consists of<br />\ntwo different types of missiles: the<br />\nSpartan missile which is designed to<br />\nintercept enemy missiles before they<br />\nre-enter earth's atmosphere and which<br />\nhas a range of approximately 400 miles;<br />\nand the smaller Sprint missile, with a<br />\nrange of 25-30 miles, which is supposed<br />\nto pick up enemy projectiles that<br />\npenetrate the Spartan defense and<br />\ndisarm them 100,000 feet above their<br />\ntargets.<br />\nDevastate our Cities<br />\nGiven the location of the two ABM<br />\ninstallations proposed for initial<br />\nconstruction by the Administration, the<br />\nonly one of the nation's 25 largest cities<br />\nthat would receive even theoretical<br />\nprotection against a Chinese attack<br />\nwould be Minneapolis. The rest of our<br />\nurban population would remain as<br />\nvulnerable as before.<br />\nWould this situation be remedied by<br />\ndeploying the ten additional sites the<br /><br />\nPentagon is reportedly contemplating? I<br />\nthink not. According to scientists both<br />\nin and Out of government, it is relatively<br />\neasy to deceive the radar which guides<br />\nthe Spartan missiles with decoys and<br />\nother deception devices. It is not until<br />\nobjects actually re-enter the atmosphere<br />\nthat radar can reliably differentiate the<br />\ndecoys from the real thing. At this<br />\npoint,it falls to the Sprint to provide the<br />\nultimate protection.<br />\nBut the Pentagon has announced its<br />\nintention to place its ABM sites a<br />\nconsiderable distance from our cities,<br />\nwhich<br />\nwould place our major<br />\npopulation centers outside the range of<br />\nthe Sprints. Thus, with a little ingenuity<br />\nand the technical proficiency which the<br />\nSoviets now have sand the Chinese will<br />\nlikely possess soon, they could<br />\npenetrate our Spartan defense and<br />\ndevastate our cities.<br />\nIn other words, the justification of<br />\nthe ABM as protection against a Chinese<br />\nnuclear attack simply defies the facts.<br />\nThe argument that the ABM would<br />\nprovide useful protection against a less<br />\nthan \"all-out\" irrational or accidental<br />\nattack by the Soviets is hardly more<br />\nconvincing.<br />\nDefies Reason<br />\nThe \"irrationality\" of a Soviet Missile<br />\nattack on the U.S. would be irrational<br />\nbecause it would be suicidal. Regardless<br />\nof the destruction wreaked on the U.S.,<br />\nthe U.S.S.R. would also be obliterated<br />\nin the process. However, to assume that<br />\nsuch a Soviet attack might also be<br />\n\"irrational\" enough to be less than<br />\n\"all-out\" defies reason.<br />\nWhy should any Soviet leader send<br />\nonly a few missiles over when he knows<br />\nthe U.S. will retaliate with its full<br />\nsecond-strike force? Even men as mad as<br />\nHitler were never guilty of such<br />\nthoughtless accomodation to then<br />\nenemies. If the Soviets did attack, it<br />\nwould certainly be with full force,<br />\nwhich by the Pentagon's own reckoning<br />\nwould render the proposed Safeguard<br />\nsystem useless.<br />\nAs for accidental attack, I assume it<br />\nwould consist of one or two missiles<br />\nthat unintentionally \"got away\".<br />\nIf this enemy missile were targeted at<br />\na missile site, we would at most siMPIY<br />\nlose a few of our 1,000 ICBM's, and a<br />\nfew lives would be lost. It is hardLY<br />\nworth the vast- expense of an ABM<br />\nsystem to insure against loss of a few<br />\ndrastically less expensive ICBM's.<br />\n(Continued on Page 9)<br /><br />\nVeritas<br /><br />\nritOTC<br /><br />\nDefended: Defining the IssuesI<br /><br />\nBy ROBERT M. LIPSHUTZ<br />\nThere are three broad subdivisions under Athich<br />\n.<br />\nthe<br />\ncurrent. ROTC issue should be discussed: issues inherent<br />\nwithin ROTC, the larger issues in which the controversy<br />\nis placed, and the role of political action.<br />\nIn support of continuing the ROTC program, many<br />\npoints can be made. First, the program is a voluntary<br />\nextracurricular activity. For those who do not opt to<br />\ntake it, they may drop out at any time in the first two<br />\nyears. Upon graduation, a student may resign his<br />\ncommission. For those who stay in, they can get through<br />\ntheir military service in two years as officers.<br />\nFor those who do not disagree with the war, or who<br />\ndo not want to spend years evading the draft, it is a very<br />\neasy way to get through the service. It is as wrong to<br />\ndeny someone the opportunity to make this moral<br />\nchoice as it would be to make ROTC compulsory.<br />\nROTC civilianizes the Army. Of the second<br />\nlieutenants who enter the Army each year, 45% are<br />\nROTC trained. They most often serve two years and<br />\nleave. Those who remain, rise disproportionately to<br />\nleadership positions. Col. Parmly, director of ROTC on<br />\nthe Johns Hopkins campus, informed me that when he<br />\nattended Command General Staff College at Fort<br />\nLeavenworth, Kansas, in 1959, over two-thirds were not<br />\nfrom the service academies, with most of these from<br />\nROTC.<br />\nBroader Perspective<br />\nGiving military training during the college experience<br />\nprovides a constant contrast between Army training and ,<br />\nthe less heirarchical and more two-way process (in<br />\ntheory, at least) of a university education. For social<br />\nscience and humanities majors, ROTC provides an<br /><br />\nopportunity to contrast both the subject matter and the<br />\nmeans of presentations of both modes of learning. This<br />\nbrings a broader perspective to the military. Since only<br />\n45% of second lieutenants are ROTC graduates and most<br />\nleave after two years, the fact is that 65% of those<br />\ntrained for eventual promotion to general are ROTC<br />\ngraduates indicates that the Army values this<br />\nperspective.<br />\nOfficer candidate school and the service academies are<br />\nnot as good for training officers in a civilian-run,<br />\ndemocratic nation, as is ROTC. Both put the process of<br />\nsocialization of the armed forces totally in the hands of<br />\nthe military. Without ready access to alternate modes of<br />\nthinking during this process, the officer who emerges<br />\ncannot help but be less willing to question basic tenets<br />\nof military doctrine.<br />\nAs these men rise to 1;.:, top leadership positions<br />\nwithin the service, they tend more to emphasize force<br />\ninternally and externally than would a soldier trained in<br />\na civilian context.<br />\nBut ROTC, secret research and even the Vietnam<br />\nwar are only parts of the larger issue of the power<br />\nstructure of this society, the nature of the forces which<br />\nbenefit from it and sustain it, and what if anything<br />\nshould be done to change it. The other issues are at best<br />\nperipheral.<br />\nOstrich Idealism<br />\nPeripheral issues may be thought of as valuable in an<br />\neducatory process. Without discussing this point, the<br />\nvalid objection that can be raised to the use of ROTC as<br />\nan issue is that terminating ROTC could only militarize<br />\nthe service, and hence the society, even more than it is<br />\nnow. The point can be seen in even better perspective if<br /><br />\neach student will think upon his friends from back hont.e<br />\nwho went into the service instead of college. Imagine If<br />\nthey ran the military and advised national leaders.<br />\nThe anti-war partisans, one of which I am not, have to<br />\n.,<br />\nmake a basic choice. They can indulge in ostrich idealis111<br />\nby battling to remove ROTC from campus, which valI<br />\ntake away the daily reminders of war but will make 3<br />\nmore militarized nation. They may becorne<br />\nrevolutionaries and wait for the walls of society to come<br />\ntumbling down.<br />\nOr, they can go through the hard, slogging process Of<br />\npolitical agitation. The McCarthy campaign changed the.<br />\ncourse of politics in 1968. It brought issues before the.<br />\npeople of this nation, and won friends for the anti-war<br />\ncause. In not too long, primaries will be held for<br />\ncongressmen and senators across the nation. Tile<br />\nMcCarthy effort was quickly put together and yen'<br />\ndisorganized.<br />\nIf preceded by an effective and vigorous campair!'<br />\nthe anti-war forces for Congress may increase their,.<br />\nstrength in 1970, and even before then a campaign.\u00b0'<br />\nmass agitation may intensify the peace drive building<br />\nwithin the. President's own party, as the recent<br />\nAiken-Scott statements show. If the anti-war people<br />\nhave any faith in their own cause, then the choice is Ot<br />\ntoo hard to make.

Frank is best remembered for..<br />\nhis violent polemics against the New Deal,<br />\nwhich gained<br />\nintensity after he was deposed as University president by<br />\nthe Board of Regents under Governor Philip<br />\nLaFollette.<br />\nIndeed, he became such a prominent Republican<br />\nSpokesman as to figure in speculation for the 1940<br />\nnational ticket. He did receive a Wisconsin nomination<br />\nfor U.S. Senator that year, but died<br />\nin mid-campaign.<br />\nHowever, it may be of more interest than a review of<br />\nhis political career to consider the development of<br />\nFrank's thought in the 1920's. The polemics against the<br />\nNew Deal are not a distinctive contribution. Earlier,<br />\nduring his career on the editorial staff of the Century<br />\nMagazine, Frank produced some interesting papers on<br />\none of the major questions in our<br />\nhistory. This is the<br />\nrole of the scholar in politics.<br />\nIntellectually Superior<br />\n, Only a minority of university presidents become<br />\n'actors in the politics of their time, and these have<br />\ndiffered as to how deeply they should pursue a political<br />\near.eer. Woodrow Wilson, whose reform drive<br />\nat<br />\nPrinceton had struck a hopeless impasse<br />\nin 1910, was<br />\nready to shuck his academic robes entirely; Nicholas<br /><br />\nMurray Butler, who had a flourishing establishment at<br />\nColumbia in 1904, positively refused to seek the<br />\nGovernorship of New York.<br />\nDr. Butler, however, was generally frustrated as to the<br />\ninfluence he could exert in politics. This contagion has<br />\nstruck several others who were intellectually superior to<br />\nthe reigningpoliticians and felt their political influence<br />\nwas in inverse proportions to their intellect. The<br />\nexample of Henry Adams leaps immediately to mind;<br />\nEdward Everett, John C. Calhoun, William E. Borah and<br />\nother members of the Adams family are also on record<br />\nwith favorable impressions of their own intellectual<br />\nprowess.<br />\n\u2022<br /><br />\nBad Candidate<br /><br />\nIn this case there is a tendency for the disappointed<br />\npower-seeker to reject democracy entirely. Henry<br />\nAdams, who spent several years at the center of<br />\ngovernment without apparently influencing any of its<br />\nacts, eventually consummated a retreat from modern<br />\ntimes in his Mont Saint-Michel and Chartres.<br />\nThe formidably learned Henry Cabot Lodge, who was<br />\navailable for the Presidential nomination in 1916 and<br />\n1920, came to a total rejection of the system of<br /><br />\nPresidential elections, lie wrote that he would make a<br />\ngood president but a bad candidate.<br />\nFrank definitely agreed with Senator Lodge's private<br />\njudgement that a democracy does not bring its best men<br />\ninto government. Butler made the same judgment\u2022<br />\npublicly, in both speech and writing. One of the<br />\ncharacteristics which Frank assigned to democracy was<br />\nthat \"It rarely elects its best men to office except by<br />\naccident\".<br />\nMinimal Influence<br />\nThe heart of Frank's philosophy is that while a man<br />\nof superior intellectual attainments was physically<br />\ncapable of entering politics, he would thereupon debase<br />\nhimself by pandering to the crowd. Ile conceded that an<br />\nintellectual might win office, but only by tailoring<br />\nhimself to the requirements of a campaign. This theory<br />\nis not borne out by the career of Senator Lodge, but it is<br />\nborne. out by the fact that very few politicans resembled<br />\nSenator Lodge.<br />\nWithout collaboration, Frank devised a philosophy of<br />\nlife for the scholar in politics that resembles Butler's. lie<br />\nwould not enter politics himself' in order to keep himself<br />\nunsullied, lie did conceive of educating the populace by<br />\nextensive writing and public speaking.<br />\n(Continued on page 10)<br /><br />\nSenate Again Questions Safeguard<br /><br />\n(Continuedfrom Page 8)<br />\nh The final justification offered Dy tne<br />\nrentagon in support of the Safeguard is<br />\ntost serious. It is based on the claim<br />\nthat our second-strike capability is being<br />\nthreatened by the Soviets<br />\nand that<br />\nPleasures must<br />\nbe taken to protect<br />\nPortions of our second-strike force.<br />\n. If in fact our retaliatory capability is<br />\nIrlp_cluestion, we must act immediately to<br />\ntore it. The<br />\nSoviets must never doubt<br />\n,<br />\nc4r ability to inflict unacceptable<br />\n\"'linage to their society in response to a<br />\n:1\u201eIseL-emptive attack. This is the very<br />\nZ\u00b0stance of our deterrent strategy. If<br />\nretaliatory capability is in question,<br />\nild,itions to our offensive forces, not<br />\nIlelous defensive missiles, ought to be<br />\n\u00b0Qr<br />\nstrategy.<br />\nThere is no evidence that our<br />\n7ond-strike<br />\ncapability<br />\nis being<br />\na.eatened<br />\nr<br />\nor that Moscow doubts its<br />\nglectiveness.<br />\np Last month, before the Senate<br />\norei<br />\n\u2014<br />\nbisa gn Relations Subcommittee on<br />\n-rmament, Secretary igt Defense<br />\n7d declared that the Russians \"are<br />\nmg for a first strike capability \u2014 there<br />\n,<br />\n1 110 question about that.\" This came as<br />\nitmlock to those of us in Congress who<br />\nLe,acutely interested in this nation's<br />\nense posture.<br />\nDoubts Mr. Laird<br />\nthThe National Intelligence Estimate \u2014<br />\nhie, consensus view of the Defense<br />\ntelligence<br />\nAgency,<br />\nthe<br />\nState<br />\n1,,v Partment,<br />\nthe<br />\nCentral<br />\nand<br />\nkqt.elligence Agency \u2014 de n i es the<br />\n615,tence of any first-strike plans on<br />\nthe<br />\nof the Kremlin or any signs that<br />\nplans are in the making.

This is a total of<br />\n2400 nuclear missiles, eached armed<br />\nwith one or more nuclear warheads.<br />\nAccording to former Secretary of<br />\nDefense McNamara's estimates, it would<br />\ntake no more than 400 nuclear<br />\nwarheads to damage the Soviet Union<br />\nbeyond recognition and repair.<br />\nMr. Laird bases his claims about<br />\nSoviet intentions to develop a<br />\nfirst-strike capability on the deployment<br />\nof 200 Russian SS9 missiles. We have<br />\nknown about these missiles with large<br />\nwarheads for several years, and our<br />\nintelligence evaluations have considered<br />\nthem part of the Soviet second- strike<br />\nforce designed to destroy our cities in a<br />\nretaliatory attack. Suddenly, without<br />\nexplanation the Secretary of Defense<br />\nhas decreed that they are now<br />\nfirst-strike weapons.<br />\nEven accepting this questionable<br />\nturnout, the SS9 provides no reason for<br />\ndeploying an ABM in this country. The<br />\nSoviets would require more than 200 of<br />\nthese SS9's armed with 20 megaton<br />\nwarheads to destroy our entire<br />\nMinutemen force \u2014 and this would still<br />\nleave us with 656 submarine-launched<br />\nmissiles and our intercontinental<br />\nbombers with which to retaliate,<br />\nNo More Provocation<br />\nFinally, the credibility of Mr. Laird's<br />\ncontention that Moscow has first-strike<br />\ndesigns is undermined<br />\nby<br />\nhis<br />\nrecommended response. He is calling for<br />\na limited ABM system that will not<br />\n\"provoke\" the Soviets. If, in fact, the<br />\nSoviets are intent on developing their<br />\ncapability to destroy us and our ability<br />\nto retaliate, and if the ABM is a<br />\nworkable defense, should we not<br />\nproceed immediately with a \"heavy<br />\nsystem\" to protect our people and all<br />\nour missiles? And why are we worried<br />\nabout provoking a nation which<br />\nsupposedly already has decided to go<br />\nall-out to annihilate the United States?<br />\nHow can they be further provoked?<br />\nA careful examination of the three<br />\nprincipal justifications for an ABM<br />\nsystem offered by the Administration<br />\nyields little reason to support<br />\ndeployment. Indeed, the Pentagon's<br />\nown contradictory and inconsistent<br />\ndefense of the system provides a<br />\npersuasive case for its rejection.<br />\nHowever, it is conceivable that a<br />\nproposal may possess merit though it<br />\nwill not do what its proponents claim.<br />\nTherefore, I believe there are several<br />\nother questions that must be raised<br />\nbefore a responsible decision on<br />\ndeployment can be reached.<br /><br />\nThe most obvious is whether or not<br />\nthe Safeguard system will actually<br />\ndisarm enemy missiles before they<br />\ndestroy their targets. That is, will it<br />\nwork? The weight of scientific evidence<br />\npresented before the Congress to date<br />\nindicates the ABM will not work.<br />\nSafeguard's technology is essentially<br />\nthe same as that of Nike-X, which was<br />\nrejected as inadequate when it was<br />\ndeveloped. The last five science advisors<br />\nto the President, the President's Science<br />\nAdvisory Committee, and hundreds of<br />\nscientists across the country have<br />\nentertained serious questions about the<br />\ntechnical difficulties an ABM system<br />\nwould encounter. Most of their<br />\nquestions, such as those concerning<br />\nradar blackout, computer programming,<br />\nsaturation, fallout, and command and<br />\ncontrol links, remain unanswered. In<br />\nfact, many can only be answered with<br />\nconfidence under actual combat<br />\nconditions, when it is too late to correct<br />\nsystems failure.<br />\nSo far we have focused on what the<br />\nSafeguard's proponents say it will do \u2014<br />\non its potential benefits. A balanced<br />\nappraisal dictates an evaluation of<br />\npossible<br />\ncosts<br />\nresulting<br />\nfrom<br />\ndeployment.<br />\nFirst, we must consider the impact of<br />\nconstructing an ABM system on the<br />\narms race and international stability.<br />\nThe President contends that because<br />\nthe Safeguard system is \"thin\" and its<br />\navowed<br />\npurpose<br />\nis<br />\ndefensive,<br />\ndeployment will not provoke the<br />\nSoviets into expanding their own missile<br />\nforces. While the absence of a Soviet<br />\nreaction would be welcome, it seems<br />\nhighly unlikely.<br />\nWhy should the Russians, with their<br />\nobsession for defense conditioned by<br />\ntwo World Wars, exercise more restraint<br />\nthan we ourselves have managed? After<br />\nall, the Pentagon's decision to proceed<br />\nwith the Safeguard was partially in<br />\nresponse to the Kremlin's decision to<br />\ndeploy a very limited system around<br />\nMoscow. In addition, this small ABM<br />\nsystem \"provokoed\" us into developing<br />\nmultiple-in dependenly-targeted<br />\nreentry-vehicles (M1RV's) for our own<br />\nmissiles to insure our capacity to<br />\npenetrate anti-missile defenses.<br />\nIncrease Offensive Forces<br />\n' At a minimum, the Soviets could be<br />\nexpected to increase their offensive<br />\nforces sufficiently to saturate our<br />\nSafeguard defenses in Montana and<br />\nNorth Dakota, thereby preserving their<br />\nability to strike our missile bases. More<br />\nlikely, given the action-overreaction<br />\npattern that has characterized the arms<br />\nrace, they would feel compelled to<br />\nincrease their offensive missile forces, to<br />\nexpand their ABM system, and to begin<br /><br />\nto develop their own MI RV's.<br />\nOnce both nations begin to deploy<br />\nABM systems and MIRV's, the history<br />\nof strategic arms races will have entered<br />\na disastrous new phase from which there<br />\nmight be no escape. Massive new levels<br />\nof expenditure and danger will be<br />\nimposed on both peoples with no gain<br />\nor security for either.<br />\nBillions for Insecurity<br />\nAs we and the Soviets could no<br />\nlonger accurately estimate either the<br />\noffensive or defensive capabilities of the<br />\nother, both<br />\nnations would<br />\nbe<br />\ncondemned to add continuously to their<br />\narmaments to guarantee that neither<br />\ncould attain a first-strike potential. In<br />\naddition to being incredibly expensive,<br />\nthis endless arms race would produce a<br />\npermanent strategic instability that<br />\nwould invite miscalculation and a<br />\nheightened possibility of a nuclear<br />\nexchange.<br />\nIn other words, deployment of the<br />\nABM and its antidote, the MIRV, would<br />\nplace us in the paradoxical position of<br />\npurchasing insecurity at a very dear<br />\nprice.<br />\nNext, there is the matter of<br />\nopportunity costs. Every government,<br />\nbusiness and household must weigh]<br />\nintended spending against the benefits<br />\nthat would be derived from alternative<br />\nuses of the money.<br />\nDetermining how much the Safeguard<br />\nsystem would cost is difficult. The<br />\nPentagon has provided an estimate of $7<br />\nbillion. However, according to a recent<br />\nBrookings Institute study, U.S. weapons<br />\nsystem consistently cost taxpayers<br />\n300% to 700% more than initial Defense<br />\nDepartment estimates. Therefore, at a<br />\nminimum, we arc contemplating an<br />\nexpenditure of between $21 billion and<br />\n$49 billion.<br />\nMore importantly, increases in<br />\nmilitary<br />\nspending<br />\nwould<br />\nrender<br />\nimpossible the needed reordering of the<br />\nnational agenda. Though we are the<br />\nmost affluent of nations, resources in<br />\nthe public sectpr remain limited. The<br />\nwar in Vietnam and a burgeoning<br />\ndefense budget have compelled us to<br />\nignore pressing domestic problems.<br />\nOur central cities are in an advancing<br />\nstage of deterioration.

The most distrubing aspect of<br />\nthe recent raid on the Homewood<br />\ndorms was the cry that went up from<br />\nthe non-arrested students, \"We all<br />\nsmoke pot.\"<br />\nIs this true?Certainly not. There are<br />\ndozens of students in the freshman<br />\ndorms who do not turn on, a few who<br />\ndo not use drugs of any kind. But as<br />\na<br />\ngeneralization \"we all smoke pot\" is as<br />\ngood as most.

Many of<br />\nthem have been smoking grass for years;<br />\nall of them know people who have, and<br />\nnone of them has seen any serious<br />\nlong-range adverse effects, or so they<br />\nsay. They are sure they know more<br />\nabout marijuana than the doctors, they<br />\nare convinced that pot is non-habit<br />\nforming, and they feel that it is a far<br />\nsafer drug than alcohol.<br />\nThe middle- and upper-class boys at<br />\nHopkins have watched their parents<br />\ndrink all their lives.

They much prefer pot.<br />\nAlcohol is a depressant, and although it<br />\ndepresses inhibitions first, that soon<br />\npasses and too much alcohol leads to<br />\nstupor, hardly a pleasurable state for 19<br />\nyear-olds who want experience, not<br />\nescape. Alcohol dries you out and brings<br />\non hangovers. It is expensive. The only<br />\ngood thing about it is that it comes in<br />\nmany varieties, usually tasty, and it is<br />\nsocially acceptable.<br />\nPot does not taste good and you get<br />\ntwo to five years for smoking it but in<br />\nevery other way smokers say it beats<br />\nalcohol. It is cheap (two people can get<br />\nstoned on SI worth). There is no<br />\nhangover, it induces a restful sleep, not<br />\none interrupted by trips to the john of<br />\nintense thirst. Beyond sleep, the big<br />\nthree of pot are music, sex, and food.<br />\nStudents say you can almost taste the<br /><br />\n***<br /><br />\nmusic when you are stoned, or hear the<br />\nfood. The sense of rhythm is much<br />\nsharper when you are turned then when<br />\nyou are straight, and you hear things in<br />\nthe music you never heard before. Food<br />\ntastes marvelous; sexual pleasure and<br />\ncapacity are heightened, not lowered as<br />\nwith alcohol. The mood is usually one<br />\nof peace and friendliness.<br />\nAs the students at Hopkins see it, to<br />\ngive a two to five year prison term to<br />\nsomeone for smoking pot is absurd,<br />\nespecially when the use of LSD is only a<br />\nmisdemeanor and consuming alcohol no<br />\ncrime at all. And as we learned from<br />\nprohibition, people will not obey laws<br />\nthey judge to be absurd.<br />\nDoes the University know that most<br />\nof its students smoke pot?Of course.<br />\nWhat has it done about it?Nothing. To<br />\nmany of us, this is the most distrubing<br />\naspect of the present affair. The<br />\nUniversity forces freshmen to live in the<br />\ndorms; anyone who has gone to the<br />\nslightest effort to inform himself knows<br />\nwhat is going on there. It throws 18year- olds into a social situation that<br />\nalmost compels them to turn on. To my<br />\nknowledge no parent of an entering<br />\nfreshman is told by University officials<br />\nthat pot prevails in the dorms, nor are<br />\nthe students informed about the<br />\nconsequences of their actions. The<br />\nhousemasters seem to ignore it unless it<br />\naffects grades; when that happens the<br />\nauthorities arrange for counciling for<br />\nthe student in trouble. In short, they<br />\nhelp the individual but do nothing to<br />\nchange the situation.<br />\nLast week three freshmen got busted.<br />\nIt is quite possible that they will serve<br />\njail sentences; it is no exaggeration to<br />\nsay that this will ruin their lives. By any<br /><br />\nWhy is Camaro<br />\nthe pace car again?<br /><br />\nGM<br /><br />\nstandards the Univers<br />\n. ity is. partly<br />\nresponsible for this tragedy. Yet it has<br />\nwashed its hands of the whole affair, is<br />\ndoing nothing to aid the arrested<br />\nstudents, will not take a stand on pot,<br />\nwill not even mobilize its own students, \u2022<br />\nmuch<br />\nless<br />\nthe entire Ilopkins<br />\ncommunity in the three freshmen's<br />\ndefense has said not a single word on<br />\nwhat it proposes to do about the<br />\nsituation prevailing in the dorms. It is<br />\nnot even willing to provide lawyers for<br />\nthe student's defense.<br />\nAttempts are being made to draw a<br />\nparallel between the pot situation in the<br />\ndorms and the booze situation in the<br />\nfraternity houses. Nearly everyone in<br />\nthe fraternity houses drinks. practically<br />\nnone of them legally. Certainly the<br />\nUniversity knows what is going on and<br />\nhas done nothing about it; certainly the<br />\ncops might pull a bust on the fraternity<br />\nhouses any Saturday night and round up<br />\nhundreds of under-age drinkers. If they<br />\ndid the University would have no reason<br />\nto speak out in defense of the arrested<br />\nstudents. But the analogy is weak.<br />\nPunishment for under-age drinking is<br />\nlight, usually a small fine. Parents know<br />\nthat their sons are drinking in houses<br />\nand do not object. The University does<br />\nnot force its students to live in<br />\nfraternity houses. With pot, the<br />\npunishment is high, parents neither<br />\nknow or approve, and the University has<br />\nforced the students to live in the dorms.<br />\nIf the University officials think that<br />\nturning on is harmful, they should have<br />\nlong ago done something about it. If<br />\nthey do not think it is harmful they<br />\nshould stand up for the arrested<br />\nstudents and against - the present<br />\nnarcotics laws.<br />\nStephen A.

Unfortunately, this program simply hasn't<br />\ndelivered very much. Although it has trained over 4000<br />\nworkers, it has placed only 1500 of them.

I<br />\npersonallysee no reason \u2014 financial or<br />\notherwise \u2014 for the University to make<br />\nthis cutback. Last Monday night, all the<br />\ncoaches (full and part-time) plus a student<br />\nrepresentative from each of the sports<br />\ngathered with Deans Kimball and Bilgrave.,<br />\nand Marshall Turner to discuss the<br />\nany<br />\nup<br />\nclear<br />\nand<br />\nsituation<br />\nmisunderstandings that the recent budget<br />\ncontroversy might have brought out into<br />\nthe open. The basic idea of a meeting was<br />\na good one even though nothing<br />\nconclusive was decided.<br />\nNeither Dean Kimball's position, nor that of<br />\nDr. Gordon, was irrevocable, as proven by last<br />\nweek'sdecisions and Monday night's statements<br />\nto reconsider the wisdom of dropping the five<br />\nsports. This is a step in the right direction, but<br />\nwe, the students will not be satisfied until these<br />\nlive sports are fully reinstated, without jeopardy<br />\nto the rest of the athletic budget or the<br />\nintercollegiate program.<br />\nAt campuses around the country, the term<br />\n\"non-negotiable demands\" is often bantered<br />\naround. Perhaps, the connotations of this term'<br />\nare bad, but the conviction it conveys is not.<br />\nReinstatement of the five sports is a<br />\nnon-negotiable demand. The question of how the<br />\nfinancial arrangements should be made to keep<br />\nthese live sports on the field is a little more open<br />\nto discussion.<br />\nWhere's the Money?<br />\nAt Monday's meeting the question \"Where will<br />\nwe get the money from?\" was raised. First of all,<br />\nthe financial responsibility rests with the\u2022<br />\nUniversity. Secondly, it cannot attach an<br />\nextra\"tax\" to student tuition bills to make up<br />\nthe $15,000 or so needed to keep the five sports.<br />\nThe Hopkins fund, in association with the<br />\nAlumni Association, should and must undertake<br />\na fund-raising drive to get, in the-words of Coach<br />\nSot ii', \"the Athletic Department out of the hole<br />\nand back on ground level.\" Sotir's analogy<br />\nbrought this comment from the back of the<br />\nroom: \"A hole? It's a canyon!\"<br />\nOvernight Improvements Possible<br />\nWe do not agree Ixith the opinion that<br />\novernight improvements are not possible. The<br />\noriginal budget submitted by Marshall Turner<br />\nwhich asked for $300,000(approximately a 50%<br />\nincrease over this year's sub-marginal $202,000)<br />\nwas an honest one with \"no padding\". The large<br />\nincrease is not a reflection of wild spending by<br />\nthe Athletic Department, but rather a reflection<br />\nof the University's miserly 30-year old policy<br />\ntowards the needs of the Athletic Department.<br />\nThis has to be changed \u2014 now. Equipment<br />\ninventories are at the zero-level, and despite a<br />\nraise in the pay-scale for next year, salaries are<br />\nnot on much of a competitive basis with even the<br />\npublic high schools. Come on, Dr. Gordon, et.<br />\nal., this is college. You know, the big time.<br />\nMickey Webster Speaks<br />\nMickey Webster (Hopkins '59) from the<br />\nAlumni Association put the situation in its<br />\nproper perspective when he stated that the basic<br />\npurpose of the University is \"the development of<br />\npeople.\" Moreover, the shortsighted policy od<br />\ndropping the five sports will in the long run cut<br />\ndown on the' increase of Alumni contributions,<br />\nfor in Webster's words.\"the greatest proportion<br />\nof money-givers are jocks\". Another point made<br />\nwas that the University might, if it isn't careful,<br />\nfind itself in a position comparable to the one at<br />\nUniversity of Chicago.<br />\nIf these five sports are dropped, the University<br />\nis reducing the possibility that these 112 students<br />\n,and all possible future participants in these sports<br /><br />\n\u2022\u2022<br />\n\u2022 41<br /><br />\nmight give money to the University. Now, we ask<br />\nyou administration, Dean Kimball on up, is this<br />\nwise? Stop and consider the longterm effects of<br />\nyour actions. Is $15,000 worth the alienation of<br />\nso many future alumni?<br />\nThe meeting adjourned with the consensus<br />\nthat Dean Kimball would work in \"good faith\"<br />\nto investigate what kind of sources could be used<br />\nto find the -money to run the five sports plus<br />\nupgrade the Athletic Department's financial<br />\nsituation. We hope that this faith is not betrayed.<br />\nFinancial Studies<br />\ntogether by Turner and<br />\npulled<br />\nstudy<br />\nA<br />\nBilgrave in the summer and fall of 1967 shows<br />\nthe deplorable status of athletics at Hopkins. The<br />\nsurvey was to be for the basis of a committee to<br />\ninvestigate the Physical Education Program. The<br />\nidea of the Committee was recommended by Mr.<br />\nTurner in the spring of 1967. Quick to respond<br />\nto the needs of the students, Dr. Gordon set up<br />\nthe committee in the fall of 1968.<br />\nFrom the 16 college study, which included<br />\nsuch schools as R.P.I., F&amp;M, Mit, Rutgers,<br />\nWesleyan, Harvard, Yale and Princeton, certain<br />\ntelling figures were discovered. Based on the<br />\n1966-67 athletic budget figures and a student<br />\nenrollment of 1850, it was found that Hopkins<br />\nspent $96 per student in the athletic area. This<br />\nwas the lowest figure of all the schools studied,<br />\nalthough R.P.I. was close with $97 per student.<br />\nIvies Spend More<br />\nAlthough the figures could not be \"100%<br />\naccurate\" due to different budgetary systems<br />\nused, by and large this is a \"true survey\" as<br />\ncorresponding categories were matched up as<br />\nefficiently as possible. Comparatively speaking,<br />\nlittle Wesleyan spent $229 per student, while the<br />\nIvies spent even more,(Harvard $342, Yale $330,<br />\nPrinceton $285).<br />\nThe proposed minimal $245,000 budget will<br />\nspend a little less than $126 per student which is<br />\nstill way short of Turner's and Bilgrave's 1967<br />\nestimate that it would take $170 per student to<br />\nrun a first-class operation. Presently Mr. Bilgrave<br />\ncommittee's<br />\nhis<br />\nwith<br />\naccord<br />\nin<br />\nis<br />\nrecommendation for the University to spend<br />\napproximately $157 per student, (this figure is<br />\nderived from the optimum $300,000 budget first<br />\nsubmitted to Dean Kimball). In light of this, it is<br />\nobvious that even with the proposed dropping of<br />\nthe five sports, the Athletic Program will not be<br />\nrun on a first class basis.<br />\nFind the Money<br />\nTherefore, in conclusion, we urge Dr. Gordon<br />\nrun<br />\nand his Administration to find the money to<br />\npolicy<br />\na first-class operation. Is the investment<br />\npoor<br />\nand fund-raising arms of this University so<br />\na<br />\nthat we have to continually settle for<br />\nc<br />\nAthleti<br />\nthis<br />\nMaybe<br />\non?<br />\noperati<br />\n\"shoestring\"<br />\nlarger<br />\nBudget controversy is only a symptom of a<br />\nproblem?

MAY 9, 1969<br /><br />\nNEWS\u2014LETTER<br /><br />\nPAGE 15<br /><br />\niLosing Hopkins Baseball Team Exciting B.I.A. Notes<br />\nBy RICK APPEL<br />\nWith the season drawing quickly to a<br />\nClose, the Hopkins varsity baseball team<br />\nIs currently enduring a 3-6-1 overall<br />\nrecord.<br />\nThey are presently in the midst of a<br />\nfour game losing streak, including a<br />\ndouble loss to Western Maryland, and<br />\nsingle losses to Gettysburg and<br />\nWashington College.<br />\nThere is more to this ball club than<br />\nlosing, however. The team can no longer<br />\nbe taken lightly, as it has been in the<br />\nPast. The team has become more<br />\nexciting, and boasts an average of five<br />\nruns per game.<br />\nWhether this can be attributed to the<br />\nnew uniforms, the snow fence which<br />\nmakes home runs possible, or the good<br />\nCondition of the baseball field, cannot<br />\nbe said. But the excitement is there. The<br />\nPlayers are cracking the ball.<br />\nLacks Personnel<br />\nUnfortunately, the team is lacking in<br />\nPersonnel. There is almost no depth on<br />\nthe bench, and, to make matters worse,<br />\nseveral of the starters are weak at their<br />\nPositions.According to head coach Gary<br />\nBarrette, this lack of personnel is the<br /><br />\nbiggest problem the team has to face.<br />\nIt has resulted mainly in a<br />\npoor-fielding ball club, which has<br />\nallowed its opposition six runs per<br />\ngame, and has committed twelve errors<br />\nin the last two games. The team can best<br />\nbe<br />\ndescribed<br />\nby<br />\nthe<br />\nterm<br />\n\"inconsistent\".<br />\nOn April 16, the team upset a<br />\nhighly-talented Towson State ball club<br />\nby the score of 3-1. This was only the<br />\nsecond loss of the season for Towson.<br />\nWith a rain-out causing a postponement<br />\nof the Western Maryland doubleheader,<br />\nrescheduling left the club with four<br />\ngames in three days.<br />\nThey defeated PMC by, a score of 7-3<br />\non a big five-run eigth inning. The strain<br />\nof four games in three days took its<br />\neffect on the Hopkins thin pitching<br />\nstaff, as they dropped a double-header<br />\nto a strong Western Maryland ball club<br />\nby scores of 7-3 and 10-1.<br />\nSeven Errors<br />\nWith the Jays leading Gettysburg 2-0,<br />\nthe defense collapsed and committed<br />\nseven errors. Hopkins lost 11-6, with ten<br />\nof Gettysburg's runs unearned.<br />\nThe team then went on the road to<br /><br />\nWashington College. Hopkins picked up<br />\na quick 6-0 lead, and still had things<br />\nunder control after the top of the ninth<br />\nwith five runs to defeat an extremely<br />\ndejected Hopkins squad by a score of<br />\n11-10. Five Blue Jay errors in the game<br />\nproved costly.<br />\nThe leading Hopkins hitters are the<br />\ntwo senior co-captains, Jim Zuger and<br />\nChip Breschkin. Zuger, the shortstop, is<br />\nbatting .382 on the season, including<br />\ntwo home runs and ten runs batted in.<br />\nIn addition, he is batting a cool .484 in<br />\nMiddle<br />\nthe<br />\nAtlantic Conference.<br />\nBreschkin, the catcher, is presently<br />\nhitting at .345, with ten RBI's.<br />\nThe pitching burden has been held up<br />\nby senior Hal Thorne whose record<br />\nstands at 1-2, and by junior Rich<br />\nThielke who has a 2-3 mark to his<br />\ncredit. The pitching staff was given a<br />\nsolid blow when lefty sophomore Glenn<br />\nDeuchler hurt his arm in the<br />\nRandolph-Macon game, and hasn't<br />\npitched since.<br />\nThis team deserves more than they<br />\nhave achieved. They have been scoring<br />\nruns, but giving up too many. They are<br />\ninexperienced in some areas, lacking in<br />\nothers. They do have potential.<br /><br />\nBy DAVE WIEDNER<br />\nWith the close of an abbreviated<br />\nspring intramural season drawing near,<br />\nthere seems little to debate over the<br />\nrepresentatives of each division in the<br />\nplay-offs. Gam (4-0) will certainly<br />\nrepresent the Canterbury division in<br />\nlacrosse as its balanced attack produced<br />\nvictories over its toughest competitors,<br />\nBeta, DU, and TEP, within the same<br />\nweek. TEP (4-1) assured its place in the<br />\nsemifinals as its goalie, Bill Bosch, shut<br />\nout contender ATO,4-0.<br />\nCompetition is keener in the<br />\nSouthern<br />\nand<br />\nCharles Divisions.<br />\nHowever, Sig Ep (3-1)seems destined to<br />\nmaintain its one-game advantage over<br />\nZBT. This week, Sig Ep nudged by<br />\nwinless Phi Ep on the merits of Bill<br />\nHarlow's one goal while Harry Snyder's<br />\nfour second-half goals allowed ZBT to<br />\nget by similarly winless Phi Sig.<br />\nIn the Southern Division, AEPi (4-0)<br />\nprovided itself with a half-game lead<br />\nover KA by drowning them 9-8.
