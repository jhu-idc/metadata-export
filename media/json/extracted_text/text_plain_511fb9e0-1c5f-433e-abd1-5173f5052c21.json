A<br />\nlong run around the end would get<br />\nWell underway and the white markers would be passing swiftly underfoot when a Soph would tackle and<br />\nthe ball fly, only to be recovered<br />\nby the opposition.

Palmer's polemic<br />\nagainst the junior college in last April's Atlantic Monthly appears<br />\nin the current number of the Atlantic. Mr. Palmer's arguments<br />\nare based upon two assumptions: that the American colleges are<br />\ninstrumental in creating a class of men whom we might term<br />\nthe \"gifted amateur,\" and that \"in life everywhere it is the 'over<br />\nand above' that counts.\"<br />\nThe junior college should not be regarded, it seems to us, as a<br />\nsort of preparatory school for two more years of cultural education. If its function were this, it would be an undeniable<br />\nanomaly. If a man feels that he needs or wants four years of<br />\ncultural preparation, he should attend a college for four years,<br />\nbut should not take two years at a junior college and then two<br />\nmore at a college.<br />\nThe problem, however, is not, as Mr. Palmer says, the segregation of the \"competent\" from the \"incompetent\" by sending the<br />\nlatter to junior college, but a determination, if possible, of whether<br />\nor not the great majority of men who do spend four years at<br />\ncollege would not have done just as well if they had attended only<br />\ntwo years. Palmer continues to say that the only fit judges of<br />\nwho are \"competent\" and who are not are the candidates themselves. This is only partially true, for the real test of whether<br />\nor not a college education has been a benefit comes after a man<br />\nhas been out of college for four or five years. It is only then<br />\nthat he can tell whether his \"liberal education\" has opened to him<br />\nnew channels of thought, new channels of reading, and newer<br />\ninterests in life which would have remained closed to him had<br />\nhe not attended college.<br />\nThough thefe is, of course, no definite proof of the value of a<br />\nfour-year course as opposed to a two-year course, we are inclined<br />\nto believe that the very great majority of college men's lives would<br />\nbe practically the same had they received two years of collegiate<br />\neducation or four. The \"gifted amateur,\" if he be truly gifted,<br />\nwill interest himself in his hobby just as much after two years<br />\nas he would after four. There may be a few exceptions, but they<br />\nare not in the majority. And those men in whom their college<br />\nyears have not excited additional intellectual curiosity certainly<br />\ngain nothing from the additional two years.<br />\nIn advocating the junior college, we assume that it should be<br />\nconducted along collegiate, and not prep school lines. It would<br />\nthen fulfill the needs of the very great majority of men who are<br />\nnow spending four years in getting a \"background\" which they<br />\ncould obtain in less. And those men who really, sincerely feel<br />\nthat they want more than merely a background can study for<br />\nhigher degrees.<br />\n<br />\n\\<br />\n<br />\ntEL\\<br />\n///IOT<br />\n<br />\nS<br />\n<br />\n, AmES<br />\n<br />\n\fTHE JOHNS HOPKINS'NEWS-LETTER, DECEMBER 6, 1927<br />\n<br />\nsTD<br />\n<br />\ntgers<br />\n<br />\nMAIL<br />\n<br />\nBAG<br />\n<br />\nAll letters intended for publication must be concise, written<br />\nin ink, on one side of the paper<br />\nonly.<br />\nNo attention will be paid to<br />\nanonymous letters, but names<br />\nsigned as an evidence of good<br />\nfaith will not be printed if request is made that they be omitted.<br />\nThe publication of a letter is<br />\nnot to be taken as an endorsement of its views by \"The NewsLetter\" which invites the freest<br />\ndiscussion of all matters of general interest.<br />\n<br />\nINGENIOUS!<br />\nTo the Editor of the NEWS-LETTER:<br />\nDear Sir:<br />\nAs it seems impossible for anyone interested in campus activities<br />\nto keep out of the highly interesting<br />\nand slam-bang controversy between<br />\nthe NEWS-LETTER and the Black<br />\nand Blue Jay, I suppose I'll have to<br />\n0954<br />\ntake a shot at it, too.

The<br />\ninnovations in this year's class rush<br />\nwere, of course, the substitution of<br />\none period for two, and of freeflowing red and green paint for a<br />\ntorn flag mounted by a boy.<br />\nThis departure from former practice was intended to end the hopeless series of ties in which the rushes<br />\nhave frequently finished, but its<br />\npurpose seems not 'to have been<br />\ncarried.

It<br />\nwas because of this fact that a special meeting of the Athletic Council was called; and if the Athletic<br />\nBoard continues to act with the<br />\nsame expediency as that of the former body, a schedule will be formulated shortly.

The two deciding factors in the matter of keeping a<br />\nbasketball team at Hopkins after<br />\nthis fall will be the financial success<br />\nwith which the team meets and the<br />\nsupport accorded it by the student<br />\nbody.

Palmer's polemic<br />\nagainst the junior college in last April's Atlantic Monthly appears<br />\nin the current number of the Atlantic. Mr. Palmer's arguments<br />\nare based upon two assumptions: that the American colleges are<br />\ninstrumental in creating a class of men whom we might term<br />\nthe \"gifted amateur,\" and that \"in life everywhere it is the 'over<br />\nand above' that counts.\"<br />\nThe junior college should not be regarded, it seems to us, as a<br />\nsort of preparatory school for two more years of cultural education. If its function were this, it would be an undeniable<br />\nanomaly. If a man feels that he needs or wants four years of<br />\ncultural preparation, he should attend a college for four years,<br />\nbut should not take two years at a junior college and then two<br />\nmore at a college.<br />\nThe problem, however, is not, as Mr. Palmer says, the segregation of the \"competent\" from the \"incompetent\" by sending the<br />\nlatter to junior college, but a determination, if possible, of whether<br />\nor not the great majority of men who do spend four years at<br />\ncollege would not have done just as well if they had attended only<br />\ntwo years. Palmer continues to say that the only fit judges of<br />\nwho are \"competent\" and who are not are the candidates themselves. This is only partially true, for the real test of whether<br />\nor not a college education has been a benefit comes after a man<br />\nhas been out of college for four or five years. It is only then<br />\nthat he can tell whether his \"liberal education\" has opened to him<br />\nnew channels of thought, new channels of reading, and newer<br />\ninterests in life which would have remained closed to him had<br />\nhe not attended college.<br />\nThough thefe is, of course, no definite proof of the value of a<br />\nfour-year course as opposed to a two-year course, we are inclined<br />\nto believe that the very great majority of college men's lives would<br />\nbe practically the same had they received two years of collegiate<br />\neducation or four. The \"gifted amateur,\" if he be truly gifted,<br />\nwill interest himself in his hobby just as much after two years<br />\nas he would after four. There may be a few exceptions, but they<br />\nare not in the majority. And those men in whom their college<br />\nyears have not excited additional intellectual curiosity certainly<br />\ngain nothing from the additional two years.<br />\nIn advocating the junior college, we assume that it should be<br />\nconducted along collegiate, and not prep school lines. It would<br />\nthen fulfill the needs of the very great majority of men who are<br />\nnow spending four years in getting a \"background\" which they<br />\ncould obtain in less. And those men who really, sincerely feel<br />\nthat they want more than merely a background can study for<br />\nhigher degrees.<br /><br />\n\\<br /><br />\ntEL\\<br />\n///IOT<br /><br />\nS<br /><br />\n, AmES<br /><br />\nTHE JOHNS HOPKINS'NEWS-LETTER, DECEMBER 6, 1927<br /><br />\nsTD<br /><br />\ntgers<br /><br />\nMAIL<br /><br />\nBAG<br /><br />\nAll letters intended for publication must be concise, written<br />\nin ink, on one side of the paper<br />\nonly.<br />\nNo attention will be paid to<br />\nanonymous letters, but names<br />\nsigned as an evidence of good<br />\nfaith will not be printed if request is made that they be omitted.<br />\nThe publication of a letter is<br />\nnot to be taken as an endorsement of its views by \"The NewsLetter\" which invites the freest<br />\ndiscussion of all matters of general interest.<br /><br />\nINGENIOUS!<br />\nTo the Editor of the NEWS-LETTER:<br />\nDear Sir:<br />\nAs it seems impossible for anyone interested in campus activities<br />\nto keep out of the highly interesting<br />\nand slam-bang controversy between<br />\nthe NEWS-LETTER and the Black<br />\nand Blue Jay, I suppose I'll have to<br />\n0954<br />\ntake a shot at it, too.
