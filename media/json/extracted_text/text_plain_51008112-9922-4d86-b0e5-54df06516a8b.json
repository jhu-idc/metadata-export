No one knew him. No<br />\none knew what he was. He quietly slipped<br />\ninto a room at the Golden Dream, our best<br />\nhostelry because.there was no other. All day<br />\nhe \"messed\" about the diggings, and all night<br />\nhe hung around the edges of the crowd in<br />\nthe Dream's bar. Who he was nobody cared,<br />\nbut what he was caused much speculation.<br />\nHis extremities\u2014his new cow-hide boots, his<br />\njaunty Stetson, his white hands\u2014seemed to<br />\nindicate a college-made miner, but it was evident that he knew even less about mines than<br />\na 'consulting engineer.\" He might have<br />\nbeen a speculator, but he wore a flannel shirt.<br />\nThe angle at which he carried his gun precluded the idea that he was a puncher turned<br />\nprospector. He did not talk like an Englishman nor look like an Easterner. He did not<br />\nstake a claim. He bought no dust. He did<br />\nnot gamble. He opened no store nor saloon.<br />\nIt was finally decided\u2014and public opinion<br />\nwas pretty evenly divided\u2014that he was either<br />\na consumptive up for his health or a detective<br />\nup for the government, and as all Talca either<br />\nhad colds or records he was not overburdened<br />\nwith friends.<br />\nIt was discovered, however, in one of those<br />\nmysterious ways in which news gets about in<br />\na mining country, that he was the author of<br />\nan Alaskan story, and was, in all probability,<br />\nin Talca looking for material and local color<br />\nfor another similar novel. At least that was<br />\nJim Goodwin's theory, and Jim, having been<br />\nto college somewhere in the East, was considered an oracle on matters pertaining to aft<br />\nand literature.<br />\n\u201cLet's give him some material,\" suggested<br />\nLeggie\" Warner one evening in the Dream's<br />\nbar-room, \"some of the real stuff, red hot off<br />\nthe griddle like Dirty Bill's flap-jacks.\"<br />\nAccordingly every evening when the crowd<br />\nhad collected one after another became reminiscent and told story after story. What<br />\nstories those were! There were tales of the<br />\nluckiest of big ore strikes, of the wildest of<br />\nblizzards, of the most marvelous dog teams,<br />\nof the biggest poker and monte games. There<br />\n'<br />\n<br />\nwere hunting stories, prospecting stories,<br />\nhold-up stories, wild animal stories, Indian<br />\nstories, even love-stories, and each was more<br />\nimpossible than its predecessor. The tenderfoot drank them all ill and you could see him<br />\njotting them down in his mental note-book<br />\nfor future reference. The imaginations of the<br />\nTalcaeans were vivid, but exhaustable, and<br />\nthe stories at last began to deteriorate.<br />\nJust when the yarns became so poor that<br />\neven the tenderfoot's suspicion was aroused,<br />\nBaldy Kirk thought of his little joke. Somewhere he chanced upon a copy of that great<br />\nAlaskan novel and as he said afterwards, he<br />\n'nearly broke his belt laughing.\" Of all the<br />\nred iculous descriptions and situations the most<br />\nrediculous in the book was the fight between<br />\nthe hero and a bad man. The absurdity of<br />\nthis gave Baldy, who is a great practical joker,<br />\nan idea. First he got Jack Carter, who was<br />\nworking a claim down on Crooked Creek, to<br />\nmasquerade as a bad man. Jack was the man<br />\nfor the part. lie is big, raw-boned, broad<br />\nshouldered, black haired, and on occasion can<br />\nlook most savage, though in real life he is a<br />\nmild, quiet fellow. He is moreover a sure<br />\nshot and could be trusted to shoot; scare and<br />\nyet do no harm.<br />\nTwo days before Carter was to come to<br />\nTalca and play desperado, we were all in the<br />\nDream listening to Duncan McNab telling<br />\nabout his dogs playing leap-frog with a pack<br />\nof wolves. When Scotty had finished, Baldy<br />\nsaid, \"I was over to'Tingley today and they<br />\ntold me that they heard from the Fort that<br />\nJack Carter had come out of the upper Yukon<br />\ncountry and is up to his old game.\"<br />\n'Not Roaring Jack Carter?'<br />\n\"Sure. He's killed a mail carrier on the<br />\nDawson trail an's heading this way.\"<br />\nThis news caused a great sensation, and<br />\nstories beyond number were told of ``the worst<br />\nman north of Seattle.\" The next evening the<br />\nsheriff, who was in the plot, announced that<br />\nRoaring Jack had had five thousand dollars<br />\nposted on his head by both the Canadian<br />\nNorthwestern Mounted Polic and Uncle Sam.<br />\nMore stories were told till the histories of<br />\nJessie James, Tracey and Billy the Kid combined would look like the adventures of some<br />\nNew England village cut-up beside Carter's<br />\ncrimes. All agreed that there were easier<br />\n<br />\n\fTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\n<br />\nways of making $10,000, and reckoned Carter<br />\nwould not find any obstacle in them.<br />\n<br />\n5<br />\n<br />\ngathered. \"He'd have died of fright.\"<br />\n'`Forget it,' answered the reformed' desperado. ''He's got nerve and he meant business.\"<br />\n\u2014 Boys,\" said Baldy after a pause, '`Jack's<br />\nright and drinks is on me. Set 'em up, Harris. Boys, here's to the cussedest tenderfoot<br />\never hit the country!\"<br />\nAnywhere within a radius of two hundred<br />\nmiles round Talca you can even today raise a<br />\nhearty laugh at Baldy Kirk's expense by<br />\nmerely mentioning ``tenderfoot\" or \u2014 bad<br />\nman.\" There were, however, two great and<br />\nlasting public benefits derived directly from<br />\nthe little joke. It cured Baldy of being a<br />\npractical joker and the tenderfoot of writing<br />\nH.

Our mile-relay team competed for the indoor collegiate championship<br />\nin the Columbia Games, New York, and,<br />\nowing to the spill of the ffrst man, Bridgman,<br />\nlost their chances to make good. It is said<br />\nthat the track was in wretched condition at<br />\nthe curves and this was the reason of 'Bridgman's fall. It is doubtful, however, whether<br />\nwe could have beaten Harvard, for the time,<br />\n3.32 4-5 is better than a Black and Blue university team has ever done. The men ran in<br />\nthe following order: Bridgeman, Baily (captain), Fulton, Stollenwerck.<br />\nOur two mile relay team were entered in<br />\nthe George Washington Games, in Washington. When they arrived at the Convention<br />\nHall, they were informed that there was no<br />\ntwo mile team to compete with them; so they<br />\nwere forced to run the crack Cornell mile<br />\nrelay. One concession was made, however,<br />\nand that is that the distance was set at a mile<br />\nand a quarter. Of course the Cornell men<br />\nran away from our distance men, so there is<br />\nno more to say about it. The team was composed of Breyer, Makel, Burgas' and Griffith.<br />\nIn the mile handicap event \"Dutch\" Breyer<br />\nmade good.

One race will be for a distance of a mile, each man to run a quartermile. The second race will be a four mile<br />\nrace, each mass to run a mile. The third race<br />\nwill be a two mile race, each man to run a<br />\nhalf mile. The University of Pennsylvania<br />\nwill be found in all three, and it is expected<br />\n<br />\nthat Harvard, Yale, Princeton, Cornell,<br />\nColumbia, Chicago, Michigan, Wisconsin,<br />\netc., will also enter them.\"<br />\n'There will be in addition a number of other<br />\nraces between colleges.\"<br />\n\"The relay races have now become so well<br />\nknown that we hope you will snake a special<br />\neffort to send A team.

It is univer.. u nuu n unuu .<br />\nsally recognized that those men who have become '`chiefs\" of the<br />\niP\u2022\u2022<br />\ndifferent graduate departments at Johns Hopkins stand foremost in<br />\nu \u2022<br />\nthis class. Vet too often is it the case that the undergraduates here<br />\nsr,<br />\n4<br />\n%* 12:.!<br />\n\u2018<br />\nt.541;,<br />\nhave no opportunity to come into any sort of personal relation with<br />\nst 4whose names are justly famous the world over. This is not<br />\nthose<br />\nuz<br />\nuustuuttuuttuun<br />\nhowever,<br />\nin all cases. In Physics, Latin, German, History,<br />\ntrue,<br />\nu<br />\nsubjects, the head of the department offers<br />\nvarious<br />\nother<br />\nand<br />\nring,<br />\nsome courses to the undergraduates; and the opportunities thus<br />\noffered are readily accepted.<br />\nBut there are other subjects taught at the university, in which no such advantages are<br />\noffered, in which the undergraduate is placed entirely under the care of men whose reputations<br />\nare yet to be won. We know well that the object of the university authorities is to offer us<br />\nthe best advantages in their power; we know that, if we accept President Hadley's ideas as to<br />\nwhat a college system should be, we have a curriculum as wisely laid out as that of any other<br />\ncollege in this country; yet in the one particular mentioned above, we feel that a reform could<br />\nwell be instituted.<br />\nThe reputation of a university can not rest entirely on her graduate department.<br />\nIf she is to exist and prosper for all time, she must turn her kindest thoughts to those<br />\nfrom whom come the life of the university. To the younger man should she give the greatest<br />\nopportunities, rather than to the older hero whose wagon is already hitched\u2014nay, firmly<br />\nclamped\u2014to the star of the Ph.D., dimly twinkling in the distance.<br />\n\u2022<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br /><br />\n-moir<br /><br />\n3<br /><br />\nVn .<br /><br />\nE print on another page a letter in answer to an editorial in the last<br />\nissue of the NEWS\u2014LETTER. Perhaps, after all, \"Graduate's\" point<br />\nV<br />\nAr<br />\n*<br />\n1<br />\nof view is not essentially different from our own; but he has evidently<br />\n*<br />\nmistaken one or two statements in the editorial. For instance, we<br />\nV .<br />\nadmitted<br />\nthe impossibility of a \"professor-of-things-in-general\" in<br />\nV .<br />\nAk,<br />\nwords quite similar to those of our correspondent; and we did not<br />\nadvise any student to try to absorb the whole curriculum.<br />\nWe hope that \"Graduate\" heard the address of President<br />\nHadley at Commemoration Day. He would then have beard, in an<br />\nArk:0\u2014<br />\nunmistakable way, what we tried feebly to express here. \"The colleges tend to train specialized producers to the exclusion of cultivated consumers\" was the<br />\ntheme of the orator.<br />\nThis is not a \"knock\" at anybody or anything. The writer flatters himself that he is<br />\nacquiring a liberal education, and he wishes the same to \"Graduate,\" but none the less, our<br />\ncontention must be admitted, that the tendency is toward over-specialization and not away<br />\nfrom it.<br />\n4<br />\n1<br />\n. VV. VVVVVV<br /><br />\nT would be unjust, if not criminal, if the NEWS\u2014LETTER were not to<br />\nmake conspicuous mention of a new phase of university life recently<br />\n. ,z.,z<br />\ncome to light. In the \"Magistrate,\" as given by the Hare's Foot<br />\nClub, we find not only a display of amateur talent which the underit<br />\ngraduates may feel proud to have produced, but also a better and<br />\nhealthier quality for the university as a whole. The one thing which<br />\nkeeps a university alive, which makes it ten times dearer and more<br />\nvaluable, to her students is her so-called college spirit.<br />\n\u2022<br />\nWe do not only admire and applaud for its own sake, the<br />\nspirit shown by the members of the Hare's Foot Club, but we<br />\nwelcome it as definitely stamping a new era in college spirit at this university. When we<br />\napplaud the acting or general success of particular men connected with the play, we do not<br />\nwish to appear unduly impressed by the prowess of any individual. What we want to say,<br />\nwhat we rejoice that we can say, is that every man did his best. Let us all see to it that the<br />\nspirit shown in many hours of tedious recitals is 'fully\" appreciated, that for the sake of the<br />\nuniversity we join one and all in praise of the members of \"The Magistrate..\"<br /><br />\nL<br />\nr<br />\nz,--\u201e\u201e2..<br /><br />\nf\"\u2014<br /><br />\n\u2014<br /><br />\n\u2014<br /><br />\n.,..<br /><br />\n4<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br /><br />\nBALDY'S LITTLE JOKE.<br />\nHe had sneaked into Talca like a lost dog<br />\nwho wanted to get a winter's grub, but who<br />\ndid not want to be put back in a sled team.<br />\nNo blaring bands or 'Welcome to Our City\"<br />\nbanners greeted him. No one knew him. No<br />\none knew what he was. He quietly slipped<br />\ninto a room at the Golden Dream, our best<br />\nhostelry because.there was no other. All day<br />\nhe \"messed\" about the diggings, and all night<br />\nhe hung around the edges of the crowd in<br />\nthe Dream's bar. Who he was nobody cared,<br />\nbut what he was caused much speculation.<br />\nHis extremities\u2014his new cow-hide boots, his<br />\njaunty Stetson, his white hands\u2014seemed to<br />\nindicate a college-made miner, but it was evident that he knew even less about mines than<br />\na 'consulting engineer.\" He might have<br />\nbeen a speculator, but he wore a flannel shirt.<br />\nThe angle at which he carried his gun precluded the idea that he was a puncher turned<br />\nprospector. He did not talk like an Englishman nor look like an Easterner. He did not<br />\nstake a claim. He bought no dust. He did<br />\nnot gamble. He opened no store nor saloon.<br />\nIt was finally decided\u2014and public opinion<br />\nwas pretty evenly divided\u2014that he was either<br />\na consumptive up for his health or a detective<br />\nup for the government, and as all Talca either<br />\nhad colds or records he was not overburdened<br />\nwith friends.<br />\nIt was discovered, however, in one of those<br />\nmysterious ways in which news gets about in<br />\na mining country, that he was the author of<br />\nan Alaskan story, and was, in all probability,<br />\nin Talca looking for material and local color<br />\nfor another similar novel. At least that was<br />\nJim Goodwin's theory, and Jim, having been<br />\nto college somewhere in the East, was considered an oracle on matters pertaining to aft<br />\nand literature.<br />\n\u201cLet's give him some material,\" suggested<br />\nLeggie\" Warner one evening in the Dream's<br />\nbar-room, \"some of the real stuff, red hot off<br />\nthe griddle like Dirty Bill's flap-jacks.\"<br />\nAccordingly every evening when the crowd<br />\nhad collected one after another became reminiscent and told story after story. What<br />\nstories those were! There were tales of the<br />\nluckiest of big ore strikes, of the wildest of<br />\nblizzards, of the most marvelous dog teams,<br />\nof the biggest poker and monte games. There<br />\n'<br /><br />\nwere hunting stories, prospecting stories,<br />\nhold-up stories, wild animal stories, Indian<br />\nstories, even love-stories, and each was more<br />\nimpossible than its predecessor. The tenderfoot drank them all ill and you could see him<br />\njotting them down in his mental note-book<br />\nfor future reference. The imaginations of the<br />\nTalcaeans were vivid, but exhaustable, and<br />\nthe stories at last began to deteriorate.<br />\nJust when the yarns became so poor that<br />\neven the tenderfoot's suspicion was aroused,<br />\nBaldy Kirk thought of his little joke. Somewhere he chanced upon a copy of that great<br />\nAlaskan novel and as he said afterwards, he<br />\n'nearly broke his belt laughing.\" Of all the<br />\nred iculous descriptions and situations the most<br />\nrediculous in the book was the fight between<br />\nthe hero and a bad man. The absurdity of<br />\nthis gave Baldy, who is a great practical joker,<br />\nan idea. First he got Jack Carter, who was<br />\nworking a claim down on Crooked Creek, to<br />\nmasquerade as a bad man. Jack was the man<br />\nfor the part. lie is big, raw-boned, broad<br />\nshouldered, black haired, and on occasion can<br />\nlook most savage, though in real life he is a<br />\nmild, quiet fellow. He is moreover a sure<br />\nshot and could be trusted to shoot; scare and<br />\nyet do no harm.<br />\nTwo days before Carter was to come to<br />\nTalca and play desperado, we were all in the<br />\nDream listening to Duncan McNab telling<br />\nabout his dogs playing leap-frog with a pack<br />\nof wolves.

The men ran in<br />\nthe following order: Bridgeman, Baily (captain), Fulton, Stollenwerck.<br />\nOur two mile relay team were entered in<br />\nthe George Washington Games, in Washington. When they arrived at the Convention<br />\nHall, they were informed that there was no<br />\ntwo mile team to compete with them; so they<br />\nwere forced to run the crack Cornell mile<br />\nrelay. One concession was made, however,<br />\nand that is that the distance was set at a mile<br />\nand a quarter. Of course the Cornell men<br />\nran away from our distance men, so there is<br />\nno more to say about it.

The third race<br />\nwill be a two mile race, each man to run a<br />\nhalf mile.
