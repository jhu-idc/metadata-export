There have been few<br />\nexceptions to the general rule of rectitude. All violations of tile<br />\nsystem have been rigidly dealt with; the University has been<br />\nfortunate in its affairs of undergraduate honor.<br />\nIt is the duty of every loyal Hopkins man, every student at<br />\nthe University to remember the traditions of the Honor System.<br />\nEvery man is considered a gentleman, and we believe that there<br />\nare few,if any, who cannot be placed in that category. It is up<br />\nto the individual student to maintain the standard of morality<br />\nin scholastic work of which the University is so justly proud;<br />\nit is the duty of each student to guard himself, to disregard<br />\nhis neighbor,\u2014to pay strict attention to himself only. As we go<br />\ninto the dreaded examination we must resolve that we will<br />\nmaintain the fair name of the Honor System.<br />\nAnd when we finally sign the pledge, \"I have neither given<br />\nnor received help on this examination,\" we will be able to do<br />\nso with a clear conscience.<br />\n<br />\nCOURTESY<br />\nWhile the Editor of the NEWS-LETTER did not attend the<br />\nStudent Assembly last Thursday, he understands, from reliable<br />\nsources, that the conduct of the students was nothing short of<br />\natrocious, that it was the height of rudeness, that any outside<br />\nspectator would have gained the impression that politeness was<br />\nforeign to the Hopkins' nature. Such a tendency is to be deprecated. We.believe that one of the few traditions of this University which really carries the force of a la* is the custom of<br />\nunfailing courtesy.<br />\nWhen a speaker consents to address an assembly of stu' dents at Hopkins he naturally expects to receive a quiet and<br />\ncourteous reception from his audience. He must be greatly<br />\nsurprised when the undergraduates are loud and noisy through'out the entire speech. He will go to other places, and with<br />\nhim he will carry the story of his reception at Hopkins, he<br />\nwill point to this University as an institution where hospitality<br />\nis unknown, a place to be avoided.<br />\nIt is up to the students to maintain the reputation of<br />\n\u2022 Hopkins, it is their duty to enforce the rules of hospitality.<br />\nThe NEWS-LETTER hopes that' such occurrences as that of last<br />\nThursday will be avoided in the future.<br />\n<br />\nTie a tin<br />\nto<br />\ntrouble<br />\nA TIDY red tin of Prince Albert, to be exact.<br />\nThere's the greatest little trouble-chaser in the<br />\nknown world.

There have been few<br />\nexceptions to the general rule of rectitude. All violations of tile<br />\nsystem have been rigidly dealt with; the University has been<br />\nfortunate in its affairs of undergraduate honor.<br />\nIt is the duty of every loyal Hopkins man, every student at<br />\nthe University to remember the traditions of the Honor System.<br />\nEvery man is considered a gentleman, and we believe that there<br />\nare few,if any, who cannot be placed in that category. It is up<br />\nto the individual student to maintain the standard of morality<br />\nin scholastic work of which the University is so justly proud;<br />\nit is the duty of each student to guard himself, to disregard<br />\nhis neighbor,\u2014to pay strict attention to himself only. As we go<br />\ninto the dreaded examination we must resolve that we will<br />\nmaintain the fair name of the Honor System.<br />\nAnd when we finally sign the pledge, \"I have neither given<br />\nnor received help on this examination,\" we will be able to do<br />\nso with a clear conscience.<br /><br />\nCOURTESY<br />\nWhile the Editor of the NEWS-LETTER did not attend the<br />\nStudent Assembly last Thursday, he understands, from reliable<br />\nsources, that the conduct of the students was nothing short of<br />\natrocious, that it was the height of rudeness, that any outside<br />\nspectator would have gained the impression that politeness was<br />\nforeign to the Hopkins' nature. Such a tendency is to be deprecated. We.believe that one of the few traditions of this University which really carries the force of a la* is the custom of<br />\nunfailing courtesy.<br />\nWhen a speaker consents to address an assembly of stu' dents at Hopkins he naturally expects to receive a quiet and<br />\ncourteous reception from his audience. He must be greatly<br />\nsurprised when the undergraduates are loud and noisy through'out the entire speech. He will go to other places, and with<br />\nhim he will carry the story of his reception at Hopkins, he<br />\nwill point to this University as an institution where hospitality<br />\nis unknown, a place to be avoided.<br />\nIt is up to the students to maintain the reputation of<br />\n\u2022 Hopkins, it is their duty to enforce the rules of hospitality.<br />\nThe NEWS-LETTER hopes that' such occurrences as that of last<br />\nThursday will be avoided in the future.<br /><br />\nTie a tin<br />\nto<br />\ntrouble<br />\nA TIDY red tin of Prince Albert, to be exact.<br />\nThere's the greatest little trouble-chaser in the<br />\nknown world.
