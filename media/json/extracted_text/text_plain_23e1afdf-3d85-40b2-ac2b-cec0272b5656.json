At the same time, the Johns Hopkins<br />\nUniversity, an idea first conceived by a reticent Baltimore merchant and later given direction by a determined Board of Trustees, was searching for a president.<br />\nBut in December of that same year Gilman accepted<br />\nthe challenge of a new idea in American education and<br />\ncame to Baltimore as the first President of the new<br />\nUniversity.<br />\nPursuit of Truth<br />\nIn his formal acceptance letter to the Board, a work<br />\nnow considered a cornerstone for intellectual freedom,<br />\nhe wrote:<br />\n\"The Institution we are about to organize would not<br />\nbe worthy the name of a University, if it were to be<br />\ndevoted to any other purpose than the discovery and<br />\npromulgation of the truth; and it would be ignoble in<br />\nthe extreme if the resources which have been given by<br />\nthe Fopnder without restrictions should be limited to<br />\nthe maintenance of ecclesiastical differences or perverted to the promotion of political strife.<br />\n\"As the spirit of the University should be that of<br />\nintellectual freedom in the pursuit and of broadest<br />\ncharity toward those from whom we differ in opinion<br />\nit is certain that sectarian and partisan preferences<br />\nshould have no control in the selection of teachers, and<br />\nshould not be apparent in their official work.<br />\n\"We should hope that the faculty soon to be chosen<br />\nwill be so catholic in spirit; so learned as to what has<br />\nbeen discovered and so keen to explore new fields of<br />\nresearch; so skillful as teachers; so cooperative as<br />\nbuilders; and so comprehensive in the specialties to<br />\nwhich they are devoted, that pupils will flock to their<br />\ninstruction ... from the remotest parts of the land.\"<br />\nFound A University<br />\nTo Gilman the concept of a university meant many<br />\nthings. He had long admired 'the European, especially<br />\nGerman, school system; he was aware that in order for<br />\nan educational system to be complete there must exist<br />\nsome place where new research and intellectual pursuits<br />\ncould be carried on free from external demands.<br />\nNever the less, Gilman had no intention of establishing a \"German\" university of America. He realized that<br />\na true university should not supplement society for the<br />\nscholar but should actually complement it. In fact it<br />\nwas for this reason that Gilman finally decided to make<br />\nHopkins an undergraduate and not just graduate institution; he felt his University owed too much to Baltimore to allow it \"to send its young men elsewhere for<br />\ncollege training.\"<br />\nSearch for Faculty<br />\nGilman's first problem was to find a competent<br />\nfaculty to staff his school. His first stroke of luck<br />\noccurred when he met Henry Rowland, a virtually unknown physics instructor at Rensselaer. He was immediately impressed with Rowland's insight and ability<br />\nand offered him a position teaching and doing research<br />\nat Hopkins. Rowland, soon Professor of Physics, accepted, and his revolutionary methods in optical and<br />\nspectroscopic methods helped give Hopkins a worldwide reputation in experimental physics.<br />\nIn a short time President Gilman had assembled a<br />\ndistinguished, if small, faculty consisting of Basil<br />\nGildersleeve, professor of Greek and considered the<br />\n\"greatest American Hellenist,\" Ira Remsen, professor<br />\nof chemistry and later the second President of the University, J.

Coming to Hopkins in<br />\n1914, Goodnow started a tradition among Hopkins presidents of initiating certain long range \"plans\" for betterment of the University. He put forward the \"Goodnow<br />\nPlan\" in 1925 aiming to make certain changes in the<br />\nbasic educational policy here.<br />\nAmes<br />\nOnce again it became necessary to choose a new president. Joseph Sweetman Ames, a Hopkins undergrad,<br />\ngraduate student, and professor, was named to the position. After receiving his Ph.D. in 1890, Ames was soon<br />\nappointed Professor of Physics and in 1901, chief director of the Physics Laboratory.<br />\nA noted author in the field of physics, he was selected<br />\nDean of the College Faculty, serving from 1924-29, and<br /><br />\nProvost in 1926.

Bronk, a graduate of Swarthmore College,<br />\nhad obtained his Ph.D. in Physics from the University<br />\nof Pennsylvania. He served as an instructor in that<br />\nfield until he was appointed to a full professorship at<br />\nSwarthmore in 1928. In 1927, he had become Dean of<br />\nmen at that school. For the next twenty years, Bronk<br />\nwas Professor of Biophysics and Director of the Eldridge Reeves Johnson Research Foundation at the University of Pennsylvania.

At the same time, the Johns Hopkins<br />\nUniversity, an idea first conceived by a reticent Baltimore merchant and later given direction by a determined Board of Trustees, was searching for a president.<br />\nBut in December of that same year Gilman accepted<br />\nthe challenge of a new idea in American education and<br />\ncame to Baltimore as the first President of the new<br />\nUniversity.<br />\nPursuit of Truth<br />\nIn his formal acceptance letter to the Board, a work<br />\nnow considered a cornerstone for intellectual freedom,<br />\nhe wrote:<br />\n\"The Institution we are about to organize would not<br />\nbe worthy the name of a University, if it were to be<br />\ndevoted to any other purpose than the discovery and<br />\npromulgation of the truth; and it would be ignoble in<br />\nthe extreme if the resources which have been given by<br />\nthe Fopnder without restrictions should be limited to<br />\nthe maintenance of ecclesiastical differences or perverted to the promotion of political strife.<br />\n\"As the spirit of the University should be that of<br />\nintellectual freedom in the pursuit and of broadest<br />\ncharity toward those from whom we differ in opinion<br />\nit is certain that sectarian and partisan preferences<br />\nshould have no control in the selection of teachers, and<br />\nshould not be apparent in their official work.<br />\n\"We should hope that the faculty soon to be chosen<br />\nwill be so catholic in spirit; so learned as to what has<br />\nbeen discovered and so keen to explore new fields of<br />\nresearch; so skillful as teachers; so cooperative as<br />\nbuilders; and so comprehensive in the specialties to<br />\nwhich they are devoted, that pupils will flock to their<br />\ninstruction ... from the remotest parts of the land.\"<br />\nFound A University<br />\nTo Gilman the concept of a university meant many<br />\nthings. He had long admired 'the European, especially<br />\nGerman, school system; he was aware that in order for<br />\nan educational system to be complete there must exist<br />\nsome place where new research and intellectual pursuits<br />\ncould be carried on free from external demands.<br />\nNever the less, Gilman had no intention of establishing a \"German\" university of America. He realized that<br />\na true university should not supplement society for the<br />\nscholar but should actually complement it. In fact it<br />\nwas for this reason that Gilman finally decided to make<br />\nHopkins an undergraduate and not just graduate institution; he felt his University owed too much to Baltimore to allow it \"to send its young men elsewhere for<br />\ncollege training.\"<br />\nSearch for Faculty<br />\nGilman's first problem was to find a competent<br />\nfaculty to staff his school. His first stroke of luck<br />\noccurred when he met Henry Rowland, a virtually unknown physics instructor at Rensselaer. He was immediately impressed with Rowland's insight and ability<br />\nand offered him a position teaching and doing research<br />\nat Hopkins. Rowland, soon Professor of Physics, accepted, and his revolutionary methods in optical and<br />\nspectroscopic methods helped give Hopkins a worldwide reputation in experimental physics.<br />\nIn a short time President Gilman had assembled a<br />\ndistinguished, if small, faculty consisting of Basil<br />\nGildersleeve, professor of Greek and considered the<br />\n\"greatest American Hellenist,\" Ira Remsen, professor<br />\nof chemistry and later the second President of the University, J.
