Universities were formerly dedicated to critical analysis, logical reasoning, aesthetic appreciation and ethical paination. Now veith the dominating influence of the Greek letter,'chapters over the members of the student body, our colleges are beginning'.<br />\nto instill into our American youth such moral qualities as the fighting<br />\nspirit, the will-to-win and initiative.<br />\nSuch is the interesting theory advanced by Max McConn, Dean<br />\nof Lehigh University, in the current issue of The North American<br />\nReview._ At the beginning of his treatise, the author reveals the informition that the Average college fraternity takes into account four<br />\nprincipal points in the rushing of freshmen: money; familY; the preparatory school which the rushee attended; and personal qualities.<br />\nThe financial standing of the candidate is of little importance to<br />\nthe fraternity rushing committee. If the freshman's father is an influential man in his home town and the frosh's mother is a social<br />\nleader, the rushee's chances of receiving a bid are materially increased.<br />\nThe social reputation of the preparatory school which he attended is<br />\nalso considered of great importance by the fraternity.<br />\nBut of the four criteria, the matter of \"personality\" stands foremost. A boy with a winning smile, a \"smooth line\" of conversation<br />\nand a pleasing manner, is certain to be taken. If he has won dis- \u2022<br />\ntinction in athletics, dramatics or college publication work he be\u2022<br />\n_<br />\ncomes even more desirable. - \u2022<br />\nFraternities seem to put little or no emphasis on the matter of<br />\nscholastic perfection, in the opinion of the Lehigh educator. The<br />\nchapter is, of course, interested to the extent of seeing to it that its<br />\nmembers \"stay in college\".. Probation for a, member means that he<br />\nwill be debarred from athletic competition and participation in!outside activities. The typical fraternity house is distinctly non-intellectual in general atmosphere and any conversation of a \"high brow\"<br />\nnature is completely taboo.<br />\nBut the author hastens to explain that he.is not attempting anything in the nature of an \"indictment\" of the fraternity. He admits<br />\nthat the typical Greek fritter is an exceedingly_inaustrious and hard<br />\nworking young man. In addition to his periods of class room work<br />\nand studies, he must play on the teams, practice .for the glee club,<br />\nattend dramatic rehearsals, organize meetings, give dances, arrange<br />\nbanquets and sit on numberless boards and committees.. Students contend that these outside activities are a more valuable means of training than book learning. When they graduate, they send their sons<br />\nback to the campus to follow in their footsteps and become student<br />\nleaders. Dr. McConn makes no attempt to refute these claims\u2014on<br />\nthe contrary, he admits that these contenions are sound and correct.<br />\nThese students, with their self-devised course of training, consisting of outside activities, stand for a conception of higher education, quite different from the traditional idea. In the last forty years,<br />\nstates the author, a new type of student has entered the American<br />\nuniversities\u2014a student who is incapable of profiting by the old method<br />\nof book learning. Sponsored by the college fraternity\u201e he is obtaining<br />\nhis education through work on the student activities. A campus Babbitt, so to speak.<br />\nDr. McConn'a-discussion revolves about the old, old question of<br />\nthe relative value of student activities as opposed to academic work.<br />\nHe pictures the fraternities as pushing the student one way, while the<br />\northodox college professor is pulling him in another direction.<br />\nIt has long been our opinion that in this new world of high pre&<br />\nsure business methods and rapid fire commercial activity, the apprenticeship served on the editorial staff of a college publication, or in,<br />\nsome other campus activity, is a valuable preparation for the struggle<br />\nfor existence after graduation. But'no one can deny the cultural and<br />\naesthetic value of academic work and book learning.

SCHEIDT, '30<br />\nPrinted by The Read-Taylor Company, Lombard and South Streets,<br />\nBaltimore, Md.<br /><br />\nEDITORIAL COMMENT<br />\nBROTHER BABBITT<br />\n1MRATERNITIES are causing the American colleges-to turn gradually from the advancement of book learning .to the training of<br />\npractical business men. Universities were formerly dedicated to critical analysis, logical reasoning, aesthetic appreciation and ethical paination. Now veith the dominating influence of the Greek letter,'chapters over the members of the student body, our colleges are beginning'.<br />\nto instill into our American youth such moral qualities as the fighting<br />\nspirit, the will-to-win and initiative.<br />\nSuch is the interesting theory advanced by Max McConn, Dean<br />\nof Lehigh University, in the current issue of The North American<br />\nReview._ At the beginning of his treatise, the author reveals the informition that the Average college fraternity takes into account four<br />\nprincipal points in the rushing of freshmen: money; familY; the preparatory school which the rushee attended; and personal qualities.<br />\nThe financial standing of the candidate is of little importance to<br />\nthe fraternity rushing committee. If the freshman's father is an influential man in his home town and the frosh's mother is a social<br />\nleader, the rushee's chances of receiving a bid are materially increased.<br />\nThe social reputation of the preparatory school which he attended is<br />\nalso considered of great importance by the fraternity.<br />\nBut of the four criteria, the matter of \"personality\" stands foremost. A boy with a winning smile, a \"smooth line\" of conversation<br />\nand a pleasing manner, is certain to be taken. If he has won dis- \u2022<br />\ntinction in athletics, dramatics or college publication work he be\u2022<br />\n_<br />\ncomes even more desirable. - \u2022<br />\nFraternities seem to put little or no emphasis on the matter of<br />\nscholastic perfection, in the opinion of the Lehigh educator. The<br />\nchapter is, of course, interested to the extent of seeing to it that its<br />\nmembers \"stay in college\".. Probation for a, member means that he<br />\nwill be debarred from athletic competition and participation in!outside activities. The typical fraternity house is distinctly non-intellectual in general atmosphere and any conversation of a \"high brow\"<br />\nnature is completely taboo.<br />\nBut the author hastens to explain that he.is not attempting anything in the nature of an \"indictment\" of the fraternity. He admits<br />\nthat the typical Greek fritter is an exceedingly_inaustrious and hard<br />\nworking young man. In addition to his periods of class room work<br />\nand studies, he must play on the teams, practice .for the glee club,<br />\nattend dramatic rehearsals, organize meetings, give dances, arrange<br />\nbanquets and sit on numberless boards and committees.. Students contend that these outside activities are a more valuable means of training than book learning. When they graduate, they send their sons<br />\nback to the campus to follow in their footsteps and become student<br />\nleaders. Dr. McConn makes no attempt to refute these claims\u2014on<br />\nthe contrary, he admits that these contenions are sound and correct.<br />\nThese students, with their self-devised course of training, consisting of outside activities, stand for a conception of higher education, quite different from the traditional idea. In the last forty years,<br />\nstates the author, a new type of student has entered the American<br />\nuniversities\u2014a student who is incapable of profiting by the old method<br />\nof book learning. Sponsored by the college fraternity\u201e he is obtaining<br />\nhis education through work on the student activities. A campus Babbitt, so to speak.<br />\nDr. McConn'a-discussion revolves about the old, old question of<br />\nthe relative value of student activities as opposed to academic work.<br />\nHe pictures the fraternities as pushing the student one way, while the<br />\northodox college professor is pulling him in another direction.<br />\nIt has long been our opinion that in this new world of high pre&amp;<br />\nsure business methods and rapid fire commercial activity, the apprenticeship served on the editorial staff of a college publication, or in,<br />\nsome other campus activity, is a valuable preparation for the struggle<br />\nfor existence after graduation. But'no one can deny the cultural and<br />\naesthetic value of academic work and book learning. Again, we enter<br />\nour plea for a sensible balance of these two important phases of college life.<br /><br />\nfit<br /><br />\nEdgew, orth<br /><br />\nSmoking Tobacco<br /><br />\nsuits $47a, ms,.50<br /><br />\nwel<br /><br />\nNola<br /><br />\nitrxterI oweIfie i.Hub<br /><br />\n\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022I<br />\n\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022I<br />\nOEM<br /><br />\nf.<br /><br />\nDR.
