I have always felt that if there is<br />\nsome talking to be done I would like to do<br />\na little of it myself. I have never had the<br />\nsame feeling about writing, probably because it is more troublesome.<br />\nHowever, none of this has anything to do<br />\nwith my wild animals. The most curious<br />\nand interesting specimen in my Zoo I met in<br />\nParis during the last Exposition. He was<br />\nnot savage\u2014quite the reverse. He was<br />\nmore than friendly. It happened in this<br />\nway. I was boarding in a private family<br />\nwith a class-mate of mine from here. The<br />\nclass-mate shall be nameless. I will merely<br />\nsay that even then he was deeply interested<br />\nin Goethe and always carried a pocket edition of that master about with him, which<br />\nhe would read to me in spare moments. It<br />\nwas in the original. I particularly dislike<br />\nGerman, principally, I suppose, because I<br />\ndon't understand it. I think I even told<br />\nhim so. But I digress. My class-mate had<br />\nsome friends staying at the Continental<br />\nHotel; finding me an unappreciative listener<br />\nto the noblest passages of Faust, he used to<br />\ngo to see them and through them he met a<br />\ngreat many of their fellow guests.<br />\nOne bright Sunday morning my class-mate<br />\nand I set out for Versailles to see the wonderful fountains play. We decided to go<br />\non the top of a tram-car as we could see<br />\nthe country better in that way. Perhaps I<br />\nhad better say that they have seats on the<br />\ntop of many trams in Paris. When we got<br />\nto the station my class-mate said he would<br />\nbuy the tickets, adding modestly that he<br />\nthought his French was better than mine.<br />\n<br />\nT<br />\n<br />\nI made no objection but dawdled about until<br />\nhe returned from the booking office. He<br />\nsoon came back bringing not only the tickets but two companions, whom he gruffly<br />\nintroduced as \"from the Continental.\" The<br />\nvery tone of that introduction was a challenge. I was polite, vaguely polite. They<br />\nseemed to me then only uninteresting. I<br />\ndid not know then what the day would bring<br />\nforth. By that time everyone was clambering up to the top of the tram. As we climbed<br />\nup my class-mate whispered to me, really<br />\nquite meekly, \"You know, I couldn't avoid<br />\nit. They say they don't know a word of<br />\nFrench and we'll be such a help to them.<br />\nThere's a seat for two in front; you go and<br />\nsit there with the oldish one, I'll sit behind<br />\nwith the other.\" \"The other\" doesn't enter into this story. I do not believe he<br />\nopened his mouth the whole day except to<br />\nput food into it. He was my class-mate's<br />\ncompanion. But mine was different. He<br />\nwas garrulous and I occasionally like to listen. When we took our seat in front I<br />\nHe was a<br />\ncautiously looked him over.<br />\nHis<br />\nmeagre dyspeptic-looking individual<br />\nface was adorned by a sandy wisp of a<br />\nmoustache which reminded you forcibly of<br />\na worn-out whisk broom; on his head was a<br />\nderby hat; his coat was black; his trousers,<br />\nor rather \"pants\" were striped. Altogether<br />\nhe looked like an over-worked bank clerk,<br />\nthough he said he was a doctor. Still, if<br />\nhis appearance was commonplace his conversation was most certainly not. ITis first<br />\nreally startling remark was drawn forth by<br />\nwhat looked like a \"wind mill.\" \"What's<br />\nthat old thing?\" he inquired. \"I have no<br />\nidea,\" said I. \"Why,\" he said,\"your frieild<br />\ntold me not to mind your manner. Said you<br />\nwere bashful with strangers. They al ways<br />\nhad to make you feel easy, but you did know<br />\na little about the country.\"<br />\n<br />\n\f2<br />\n<br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\n<br />\n\"Well,\" I said, for I felt I had to say<br />\nsomething after that, \"It looks like a ruin.\"<br />\n\"There,\" said he, \"now you're talking!<br />\nA ruin! Ain't that what all Europe is A<br />\nruin. What I can't see is why people risk<br />\ntheir lives on the ocean to see ruins. Why<br />\ndon't they stay at home and be comfortable?<br />\nEh!\"<br />\n\"Yes,\" I said, \"I agree with you.\"<br />\n\"Of course you do. Why I've been looking at ruined castles for months and none<br />\nof these durned fools over here has gumption<br />\nenough to tear 'em down and put up new<br />\nones. I don't s'pose it ever occurred to<br />\n'em. Hey?\"<br />\n\"No,\" I remarked weakly.<br />\n\"No. They ain't got the brain of a kitten. Look at Paris, not a durned skyscraper<br />\nin the place. Say, what d'ye think some<br />\nof these durned fools would think if they<br />\nwas to sail inter New York Harbor en see<br />\nthem high buildings. I tell you what,<br />\nyoung man, once I get back to 'God's Own<br />\nCountry' I stay there.\"<br />\n\"Yes,\" said I \"I should.\"<br />\n\"Yes, sir,\" he continued, there's only two<br />\nthings I've seen in five months 1 like, and<br />\nthey are the American Building at the Exposition and the cab system in London.<br />\nThey're both out of sight. Say, where are<br />\nyou going from here?\"<br />\n\"Switzerland,\" I murmured.<br />\n\"Well,\" he said, \"if you go to Lucerne<br />\ngo to the Sweitzerhof. It's a real nice homelike hotel. You can get what you want for<br />\nbreakfast. And there's a real nice orchestra.<br />\nFact it reminds me of the Waldorf.\"<br />\n\"0,\"I said,\"but isn't it rather expensive.<br />\nI thought the royalties put up there?\"<br />\n\"Pouh Don't ye think I'm as good as<br />\nany royalty?\"<br />\n<br />\n\"0,\" I hastened to say, \"I didn't mean<br />\nfor an instant to say you weren't. But I<br />\ndon't care to go to an awfully expensive<br />\nhotel.\"<br />\n\"Well,\" this very scornfully, \"if you're<br />\ndoing it on the cheap you better stay away.\"<br />\nAfter this there was silence for the most<br />\npart until our arrival, occasioned I fear by<br />\ngrave doubts which had arisen in my companion's mind as to my financial status.<br />\nHowever, when we were in front of the<br />\nPalace, he brightened'up again.<br />\n\"Now,\" he said to me in a confidential<br />\ntone, \"tell me what was all these buildings<br />\nused for in the olden days; law offices and<br />\nthat sort of place?\"<br />\n\"Oh, no,\" I said politely, \"the Court was<br />\nhere.\"<br />\n\"Ain't that what I said?\"<br />\n\"No,\" said I, \"you made a mistake. I<br />\nmean the king lived here.\"<br />\n\"Now come off,\" he remarked pleasantly,<br />\n\"this is too big for one man and his family.\"<br />\nThat was too much so I launched forth into<br />\na lecture on Louis Quatorze and his Court.<br />\nHe seemed to take it in with interest. At<br />\nlast, in going over the Chateau, we came to<br />\nthe State apartments of Le Grande Monargue, where there is a fine portrait of him.<br />\n\"Ah,\" said I, feeling I was at last going<br />\nto make a hit, \"there is Louis Quatorze!\"<br />\nHe looked at the portrait, then he looked<br />\nabout the room, then he looked at me with<br />\nscorn and derision, then he sniffed loud and<br />\nvulgarly, remarking in nasal tones, \"So<br />\nthat's the old duck that owned it all, is it?\"<br />\nI left him there; in fact I fled and as I<br />\nclattered through the corridors on my mad<br />\nflight to the Park, I thought:<br />\n\"Imperious Caesar, dead and turned to<br />\nclay,<br />\nMight stop a hole to keep the wind away.\"<br />\nLEON.<br />\n<br />\nTHE STREET ORGAN.<br />\nThe beastly organs I'd like to take,<br />\nAnd leave not a one as reminder;<br />\nI'd put them all in a pulp machine,<br />\nAnd then I would turn organ-grinder!<br />\n'06.<br />\n<br />\n\fTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\n<br />\n3<br />\n-<br />\n<br />\nTHE INTER-CLASS DEBATE AND<br />\nPUBLIC SPEAKING CONTEST.<br />\n<br />\nis the only occasion in the year when the<br />\nUniversity as a whole can hear the club free<br />\nof charge, and it is to be hoped that the<br />\nGlee Club had some good excuse for not taking its share in the general task of entertainment.

Armistead Welbourn, at Tokio, Japan, has recently been<br />\nreceived by a friend in this city. Mr. Welbourn graduated from the University in '96;<br />\nand is now a missionary from the Episcopal<br />\nChurch of the United States. His letter<br />\nwould at any time be very interesting to<br />\nthe students of the University, but the fact<br />\nthat it comes from one of the two nations<br />\nwho are at present engaged in a death struggle adds much to its interest.<br />\nMr. Welbourn speaks of the New. Year's<br />\ncelebration of the victories of the Japanese<br />\narms, as follows:<br />\n\"Our New Year was a joyous one, as you<br />\nmay imagine, and the usual flags and pine<br />\nand bamboo before every door made the<br />\nstreets look festive, while at night strings<br />\nof lanterns everywhere made it absolutely<br />\nfascinating. I saw two lantern processions<br />\nin the Palace grounds\u2014lines of bobbing reddish, yellowish lights against the dark background of the wall of the moat or the crooked pine trees, with the evening sky above.\"<br />\nMr. Welbourn then proceeds to tell of the<br />\nfeelings of the Japanese in the homeland:<br />\n\"The Japanese, though, were not as jubilant over Port Arthur at they would have<br />\nbeen in August; it has cost too much, and<br />\nthey feel sobered.<br />\nThe foreign attaches<br />\nsay that not a house in Port Arthur was untouched, and that the battlefields surpassed<br />\neven the description of a soldier. They are<br />\nbehaving so well here at home that it makes<br />\none very proud of them. The noblest ladies<br />\nin the land are making bandages, and themselves often changing the bandages of the<br />\nsoldiers. They go very little into society,<br />\nand have given up their carriages for jinrikishas. Religion has meant very little to<br />\nthe Japanese, but it is the opinion of many<br />\nthat the war is making them think more of<br />\nthis side of life, and that they will listen<br />\nhereafter more readily to Christianity.<br />\nWounded soldiers when convalescent have<br />\noften come and asked the missionaries to<br />\nteach them. A good many people are working in the hospitals, in which there are over<br />\nten thousand men in Tokyo alone.\"<br />\n<br />\nHe then speaks of his work, as follows:<br />\n\"My own work is entirely among students<br />\n. . . I have several Bible classes a week,<br />\nwhich pleases me very much; for it is the<br />\nmost important and lasting way of recalling<br />\nyoung men. They have ideals here as our<br />\nyoung men have. Buddhism does not have<br />\nany influence on them; and they need something to keep their ideals high, and to help<br />\nthem to put them in practice. . . . Our<br />\nChurch. has also a boarding-house for University students in this district of Hongo,<br />\nwhere the University is, and we are doing<br />\nwhat we can to make an impression on the<br />\nyoung men in it.\"<br />\n<br />\nTHE FRESMAN BANQUET.<br />\nThe Freshman banquet which took place<br />\non Tuesday, the seventh, seems to have been<br />\na rousing success\u2014at least from the Freshman view-point. Every member of the class<br />\nwho subscribed was present, not a single one<br />\nbeing detained at the last moment by unforseen and unfortunate \"accidents;\" and,<br />\ndespite the fact that the company entered<br />\nthe Belvedere in lowly silence and through<br />\nthe kitchen door, once in the spacious banquet hall, they disported themselves right<br />\nroyally.<br />\nThe tables were arranged in horse-shoe<br />\nform and were artistically decorated with<br />\ngreen, which was very appropriate. After<br />\nthe dinner, the following toasts were merrily<br />\nresponded to, Mr. Henry Hynson acting as<br />\ntoast-master:<br />\nThe Class of Nineteen-Seven\u2014George<br />\nPitts Raleigh.<br />\nThe Football Team\u2014Iredell W.

Tough.<br />\nThe toasts were followed by \"song and<br />\nstory,\" and several members of the class of<br />\n1905, who happened to drop in, greatly enlivened this part of the entertainment. The<br />\nevening closed with a hearty cheer for 1906.<br />\n<br />\n\f5<br />\n<br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\n<br />\nALUMNI NOTES.<br />\n<br />\nTO PYRRHA.<br />\n<br />\nMr. Thomas Fitzgerald, who graduated<br />\nfrom the department of electricity in 1898,<br />\nhas recently resigned from a position as<br />\ngeneral manager of the Lexington Street<br />\nRailway and Electric Light Company, Lexington, Kentucky, to accept a position with<br />\nthe Cincinnati Traction Company.

Since my last writing practice has been held regularly in the cage and<br />\nit gives me pleasure to be able to report an<br />\nall-round improvement. The old men seem<br />\nto be steadying down, and the scrub of last<br />\nyear have taken a sudden jump to the front.<br />\nThey are playing a more \"heady\" game and<br />\nseem less inclined to drop the ball at critical<br />\nmoments.

Of course, the Freshmen<br />\nare still slow in making use of an opportunity which may happen to present itself;<br />\nit takes them rather long to decide on their<br />\nnext move.

From present appearances it seems<br />\nthat none of the old players will fill the same<br />\npositions they did last year.

C. SCHMEISSER.<br />\n<br />\n\fTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\n<br />\nBASKET-BALL.<br />\nOn the night of March 2, the Hopkins basket ball team went down in defeat to the<br />\nUniversity of Maryland team by the overwhelming score of 31 to 11. Previous to this<br />\ngame both teams had one victory to its<br />\ncredit, Hopkins winning the first by 20 to<br />\n8, and the University of Maryland taking<br />\nthe second by the score of 28 to 21. The<br />\nState Intercollegiate Championship, and it<br />\nwas hoped, and indeed expected by most of<br />\nus, that Hopkins would come off the victor.<br />\nFrom the beginning of the conteset it was<br />\nquite evident that the teams were not in the<br />\nsame condition as when they came together<br />\nin the first of the championship series, but<br />\nwhether this difference was caused by the<br />\nHopkins team not being so good as in the<br />\nfirst part of the season, or that the Maryland<br />\nteam was better, the NEWS-LETTM is not<br />\nprepared to say.<br />\nIn the first half several minutes of play<br />\npassed before either five made and headway.<br />\nSoon, however, the University of Maryland<br />\ngot a line on the baskets, and began rolling<br />\nup a score which gave them a safe lead.<br />\nSomehow or other, it seemed that our men<br />\ncould not get together, and were entirely<br />\nunable to break up the team-work of the<br />\nMaryland five. It seemed that they were<br />\nnot able to make connections with the ball;<br />\nand when they did do so they were usually<br />\nso closely covered by the Maryland team<br />\nthat they could not advance it one way or<br />\nthe other. By steady team-work and accurate goal-shooting our opponents continued<br />\nto advance their score, and at the end of the<br />\nhalf it stood 19 to 4 in their favor.<br />\nWhen the second half began things appeared brighter for Hopkins. Al! the men<br />\nseemed fresh, and they began matters with<br />\na rush. Boyd and Strobhar each made a<br />\nfield goal, and for a time it looked as if they<br />\nwould make up for the ground lost in the<br />\nfirst half.<br />\nAbout the time, however, that everything<br />\nlooked so bright for Hopkins, the University of Maryland men woke up; and, as in<br />\nthe first half, began playing a very aggressive game.<br />\n<br />\n9<br />\n<br />\nAfter this time, Hopkins scored only three<br />\nmore points, all of which Captain Holmes<br />\nthrew from the foul line, while the Maryland five advanced their score twelve points.<br />\nAs in the two 'former contests, Captain<br />\nHala, Thompson and Smith played the best<br />\ngame for the Maryland five.<br />\nFor Hopkins, the individual work of each<br />\nplayer was very commendable, but for some<br />\ncause or other there was a great deficiency<br />\nin team-work, which is, as in all other games,<br />\nsuch an important factor.<br />\nMcClure and<br />\nBoyd were very aggressive in the forward<br />\npositions, and Captain Holmes was always<br />\nin the game at centre. The work of Strobhar and Blanck in the defense positions<br />\nwas especially good, particularly that of<br />\nStrobhar, who, although playing defense,<br />\nseveral times advanced far enough down the<br />\nfield to throw goals.<br />\nThe line-up was as follows:<br />\nHopkins.<br />\nBoyd<br />\nMcClure<br />\nHolmes<br />\nStrobhar<br />\nBlanck<br />\n<br />\nPosition.<br />\nR F<br />\nL F<br />\nC<br />\nR D<br />\nL D<br />\n<br />\nUniv of Md.<br />\nSwope<br />\nSmith<br />\nThompson<br />\n.Hala<br />\n.Blanck<br />\n<br />\nTRACK.<br />\nSince the indoor track meet held in Washington, February 25, under the auspices of<br />\nGeorgetown University, all track work has<br />\ncome to a standstill at the University.<br />\nNo games of any importance are near at<br />\nhand and Captain Hill will not put his men<br />\nin regular training again until they begin<br />\nwork for the University of Pennsylvania<br />\ngames. He is very much gratified with the<br />\nshowing of his men in the Georgetown meet.<br />\nThe Freshmen members of the track squad<br />\nshowed up particularly well in these games,<br />\nStewart and Hunter winning the half mile<br />\nand 440 yard dash respectively, the former<br />\na scratch and the latter a handicap event.<br />\nThe time for these events, considering it was<br />\nmade on an indoor track was good, particularly that of the half mile, which was done<br />\nin 2 minutes and 12 seconds.

D., F. R. S.; 7x5; 54 pp.;<br />\nHoughton, Mifflin and Co., Boston and New<br />\nYork. Price, 85 cents, net.<br />\nIn view of the brief while now remaining<br />\nbefore the distinguished author of this little<br />\nvolume will sever his connection with the<br />\nUniversity, in order to take up his duties<br />\nas regius professor of medicine at Oxford,<br />\nthe contents of \"Science and Immortality\"<br />\nshould possess unusual interest for Hopkins<br />\nmen. In a word, the book is a confession<br />\nof faith of the writer, the fidei confessio of<br />\na great physician. It does not pretend to<br />\ntake up the vast subject of immortality, and<br />\ndissect it; nor does it attempt either to<br />\nprove or disprove the existence of a life<br />\nafter death. It aims to be rather an epitome<br />\nof the feelings of the world upon the subject, as seen from the stand-point of a man<br />\nof science, a stand-point which, never obtruding itself, is yet always felt by the<br />\nreader.<br />\nThe book is merely the printed form of a<br />\nspeech deliVered at Harvard University last<br />\nyear by Dr. Osier in his capacity of Ingersoll<br />\nlecturer for 1904. Under the will of Miss<br />\nCaroline IIaskell Ingersoll, of New Hampshire, there was established at Harvard University, in 1893, the \"Ingersoll Lectureship<br />\non the Immortality of Man.\" The lectureship provides for one lecture each year, and<br />\nhas been filled upon each occasion by men of<br />\nthe highest intellectual rank. Dr. Osier is<br />\nthe first physician upon whom the honor has<br />\never been conferred.<br />\nThe lecture is divided into three parts,<br />\nentitled respectively, \"The Laodicians,\"<br />\n\"The Gallionians,\" and \"The Teresians.\"<br />\nThese are simply names for the classes into<br />\n<br />\nwhich Dr. Osier divides society. The Laodicians is anotheri word for those who are<br />\nindifferent to religion.<br />\n\"Indifference,\"<br />\nsays Dr. Osier, \"is the modern attitude of<br />\nmind.\" The Gallionians are those who deliberately put the matter aside as one about<br />\nwhich they neither know nor have any<br />\nmeans of knowing anything; who live<br />\n\"wholly uninfluenced by a thought of a<br />\nhereafter.\" The Teresians, \"the only people who have ever had perfect satisfaction,\"<br />\nare those \"who walk by faith and not by<br />\nsight.\"<br />\nThe author takes up each of these classes<br />\nseparately, defines its position, tells the conditions which produce it, but never moralizes.

I have always felt that if there is<br />\nsome talking to be done I would like to do<br />\na little of it myself. I have never had the<br />\nsame feeling about writing, probably because it is more troublesome.<br />\nHowever, none of this has anything to do<br />\nwith my wild animals. The most curious<br />\nand interesting specimen in my Zoo I met in<br />\nParis during the last Exposition. He was<br />\nnot savage\u2014quite the reverse. He was<br />\nmore than friendly. It happened in this<br />\nway. I was boarding in a private family<br />\nwith a class-mate of mine from here. The<br />\nclass-mate shall be nameless. I will merely<br />\nsay that even then he was deeply interested<br />\nin Goethe and always carried a pocket edition of that master about with him, which<br />\nhe would read to me in spare moments. It<br />\nwas in the original. I particularly dislike<br />\nGerman, principally, I suppose, because I<br />\ndon't understand it. I think I even told<br />\nhim so. But I digress. My class-mate had<br />\nsome friends staying at the Continental<br />\nHotel; finding me an unappreciative listener<br />\nto the noblest passages of Faust, he used to<br />\ngo to see them and through them he met a<br />\ngreat many of their fellow guests.<br />\nOne bright Sunday morning my class-mate<br />\nand I set out for Versailles to see the wonderful fountains play. We decided to go<br />\non the top of a tram-car as we could see<br />\nthe country better in that way. Perhaps I<br />\nhad better say that they have seats on the<br />\ntop of many trams in Paris. When we got<br />\nto the station my class-mate said he would<br />\nbuy the tickets, adding modestly that he<br />\nthought his French was better than mine.<br /><br />\nT<br /><br />\nI made no objection but dawdled about until<br />\nhe returned from the booking office. He<br />\nsoon came back bringing not only the tickets but two companions, whom he gruffly<br />\nintroduced as \"from the Continental.\" The<br />\nvery tone of that introduction was a challenge. I was polite, vaguely polite. They<br />\nseemed to me then only uninteresting. I<br />\ndid not know then what the day would bring<br />\nforth. By that time everyone was clambering up to the top of the tram. As we climbed<br />\nup my class-mate whispered to me, really<br />\nquite meekly, \"You know, I couldn't avoid<br />\nit. They say they don't know a word of<br />\nFrench and we'll be such a help to them.<br />\nThere's a seat for two in front; you go and<br />\nsit there with the oldish one, I'll sit behind<br />\nwith the other.\" \"The other\" doesn't enter into this story. I do not believe he<br />\nopened his mouth the whole day except to<br />\nput food into it. He was my class-mate's<br />\ncompanion. But mine was different. He<br />\nwas garrulous and I occasionally like to listen. When we took our seat in front I<br />\nHe was a<br />\ncautiously looked him over.<br />\nHis<br />\nmeagre dyspeptic-looking individual<br />\nface was adorned by a sandy wisp of a<br />\nmoustache which reminded you forcibly of<br />\na worn-out whisk broom; on his head was a<br />\nderby hat; his coat was black; his trousers,<br />\nor rather \"pants\" were striped. Altogether<br />\nhe looked like an over-worked bank clerk,<br />\nthough he said he was a doctor. Still, if<br />\nhis appearance was commonplace his conversation was most certainly not. ITis first<br />\nreally startling remark was drawn forth by<br />\nwhat looked like a \"wind mill.\" \"What's<br />\nthat old thing?\" he inquired. \"I have no<br />\nidea,\" said I. \"Why,\" he said,\"your frieild<br />\ntold me not to mind your manner. Said you<br />\nwere bashful with strangers. They al ways<br />\nhad to make you feel easy, but you did know<br />\na little about the country.\"<br /><br />\n2<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br /><br />\n\"Well,\" I said, for I felt I had to say<br />\nsomething after that, \"It looks like a ruin.\"<br />\n\"There,\" said he, \"now you're talking!<br />\nA ruin! Ain't that what all Europe is A<br />\nruin. What I can't see is why people risk<br />\ntheir lives on the ocean to see ruins.

Armistead Welbourn, at Tokio, Japan, has recently been<br />\nreceived by a friend in this city. Mr. Welbourn graduated from the University in '96;<br />\nand is now a missionary from the Episcopal<br />\nChurch of the United States. His letter<br />\nwould at any time be very interesting to<br />\nthe students of the University, but the fact<br />\nthat it comes from one of the two nations<br />\nwho are at present engaged in a death struggle adds much to its interest.<br />\nMr. Welbourn speaks of the New. Year's<br />\ncelebration of the victories of the Japanese<br />\narms, as follows:<br />\n\"Our New Year was a joyous one, as you<br />\nmay imagine, and the usual flags and pine<br />\nand bamboo before every door made the<br />\nstreets look festive, while at night strings<br />\nof lanterns everywhere made it absolutely<br />\nfascinating. I saw two lantern processions<br />\nin the Palace grounds\u2014lines of bobbing reddish, yellowish lights against the dark background of the wall of the moat or the crooked pine trees, with the evening sky above.\"<br />\nMr. Welbourn then proceeds to tell of the<br />\nfeelings of the Japanese in the homeland:<br />\n\"The Japanese, though, were not as jubilant over Port Arthur at they would have<br />\nbeen in August; it has cost too much, and<br />\nthey feel sobered.<br />\nThe foreign attaches<br />\nsay that not a house in Port Arthur was untouched, and that the battlefields surpassed<br />\neven the description of a soldier. They are<br />\nbehaving so well here at home that it makes<br />\none very proud of them. The noblest ladies<br />\nin the land are making bandages, and themselves often changing the bandages of the<br />\nsoldiers. They go very little into society,<br />\nand have given up their carriages for jinrikishas. Religion has meant very little to<br />\nthe Japanese, but it is the opinion of many<br />\nthat the war is making them think more of<br />\nthis side of life, and that they will listen<br />\nhereafter more readily to Christianity.<br />\nWounded soldiers when convalescent have<br />\noften come and asked the missionaries to<br />\nteach them. A good many people are working in the hospitals, in which there are over<br />\nten thousand men in Tokyo alone.\"<br /><br />\nHe then speaks of his work, as follows:<br />\n\"My own work is entirely among students<br />\n. . . I have several Bible classes a week,<br />\nwhich pleases me very much; for it is the<br />\nmost important and lasting way of recalling<br />\nyoung men. They have ideals here as our<br />\nyoung men have. Buddhism does not have<br />\nany influence on them; and they need something to keep their ideals high, and to help<br />\nthem to put them in practice. . . . Our<br />\nChurch. has also a boarding-house for University students in this district of Hongo,<br />\nwhere the University is, and we are doing<br />\nwhat we can to make an impression on the<br />\nyoung men in it.\"<br /><br />\nTHE FRESMAN BANQUET.<br />\nThe Freshman banquet which took place<br />\non Tuesday, the seventh, seems to have been<br />\na rousing success\u2014at least from the Freshman view-point.

After<br />\nthe dinner, the following toasts were merrily<br />\nresponded to, Mr. Henry Hynson acting as<br />\ntoast-master:<br />\nThe Class of Nineteen-Seven\u2014George<br />\nPitts Raleigh.<br />\nThe Football Team\u2014Iredell W.

Since my last writing practice has been held regularly in the cage and<br />\nit gives me pleasure to be able to report an<br />\nall-round improvement. The old men seem<br />\nto be steadying down, and the scrub of last<br />\nyear have taken a sudden jump to the front.<br />\nThey are playing a more \"heady\" game and<br />\nseem less inclined to drop the ball at critical<br />\nmoments.

Of course, the Freshmen<br />\nare still slow in making use of an opportunity which may happen to present itself;<br />\nit takes them rather long to decide on their<br />\nnext move. This fault is due to inexperience<br />\nand can only be corrected by a close study<br />\nof all possible problems which may present<br />\nthemselves to a player at any time.

This, however, will soon<br />\nbe solved when the out-door practice begins,<br />\nand speed of leg will have a chance to show<br /><br />\nitself. From present appearances it seems<br />\nthat none of the old players will fill the same<br />\npositions they did last year. This is due<br />\nto the fact that the coaches think they can<br />\nwork out a stronger combination by making<br />\nthem shift.

It is rather unfortunate that,<br />\nin the cage, we are often compelled to keep<br />\nmen out of the practice for want of room.<br />\nCage practice with too many men does more<br />\nharm than good.<br />\nWM. C. SCHMEISSER.<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br /><br />\nBASKET-BALL.<br />\nOn the night of March 2, the Hopkins basket ball team went down in defeat to the<br />\nUniversity of Maryland team by the overwhelming score of 31 to 11. Previous to this<br />\ngame both teams had one victory to its<br />\ncredit, Hopkins winning the first by 20 to<br />\n8, and the University of Maryland taking<br />\nthe second by the score of 28 to 21. The<br />\nState Intercollegiate Championship, and it<br />\nwas hoped, and indeed expected by most of<br />\nus, that Hopkins would come off the victor.<br />\nFrom the beginning of the conteset it was<br />\nquite evident that the teams were not in the<br />\nsame condition as when they came together<br />\nin the first of the championship series, but<br />\nwhether this difference was caused by the<br />\nHopkins team not being so good as in the<br />\nfirst part of the season, or that the Maryland<br />\nteam was better, the NEWS-LETTM is not<br />\nprepared to say.<br />\nIn the first half several minutes of play<br />\npassed before either five made and headway.<br />\nSoon, however, the University of Maryland<br />\ngot a line on the baskets, and began rolling<br />\nup a score which gave them a safe lead.<br />\nSomehow or other, it seemed that our men<br />\ncould not get together, and were entirely<br />\nunable to break up the team-work of the<br />\nMaryland five. It seemed that they were<br />\nnot able to make connections with the ball;<br />\nand when they did do so they were usually<br />\nso closely covered by the Maryland team<br />\nthat they could not advance it one way or<br />\nthe other. By steady team-work and accurate goal-shooting our opponents continued<br />\nto advance their score, and at the end of the<br />\nhalf it stood 19 to 4 in their favor.<br />\nWhen the second half began things appeared brighter for Hopkins. Al! the men<br />\nseemed fresh, and they began matters with<br />\na rush. Boyd and Strobhar each made a<br />\nfield goal, and for a time it looked as if they<br />\nwould make up for the ground lost in the<br />\nfirst half.<br />\nAbout the time, however, that everything<br />\nlooked so bright for Hopkins, the University of Maryland men woke up; and, as in<br />\nthe first half, began playing a very aggressive game.<br /><br />\n9<br /><br />\nAfter this time, Hopkins scored only three<br />\nmore points, all of which Captain Holmes<br />\nthrew from the foul line, while the Maryland five advanced their score twelve points.<br />\nAs in the two 'former contests, Captain<br />\nHala, Thompson and Smith played the best<br />\ngame for the Maryland five.<br />\nFor Hopkins, the individual work of each<br />\nplayer was very commendable, but for some<br />\ncause or other there was a great deficiency<br />\nin team-work, which is, as in all other games,<br />\nsuch an important factor.<br />\nMcClure and<br />\nBoyd were very aggressive in the forward<br />\npositions, and Captain Holmes was always<br />\nin the game at centre. The work of Strobhar and Blanck in the defense positions<br />\nwas especially good, particularly that of<br />\nStrobhar, who, although playing defense,<br />\nseveral times advanced far enough down the<br />\nfield to throw goals.<br />\nThe line-up was as follows:<br />\nHopkins.<br />\nBoyd<br />\nMcClure<br />\nHolmes<br />\nStrobhar<br />\nBlanck<br /><br />\nPosition.<br />\nR F<br />\nL F<br />\nC<br />\nR D<br />\nL D<br /><br />\nUniv of Md.<br />\nSwope<br />\nSmith<br />\nThompson<br />\n.Hala<br />\n.Blanck<br /><br />\nTRACK.<br />\nSince the indoor track meet held in Washington, February 25, under the auspices of<br />\nGeorgetown University, all track work has<br />\ncome to a standstill at the University.<br />\nNo games of any importance are near at<br />\nhand and Captain Hill will not put his men<br />\nin regular training again until they begin<br />\nwork for the University of Pennsylvania<br />\ngames. He is very much gratified with the<br />\nshowing of his men in the Georgetown meet.<br />\nThe Freshmen members of the track squad<br />\nshowed up particularly well in these games,<br />\nStewart and Hunter winning the half mile<br />\nand 440 yard dash respectively, the former<br />\na scratch and the latter a handicap event.<br />\nThe time for these events, considering it was<br />\nmade on an indoor track was good, particularly that of the half mile, which was done<br />\nin 2 minutes and 12 seconds. Perce, Hunter<br />\nand Lynch, three other Freshmen members<br />\nof the team all qualified in their heats but<br />\nwere unable to place in the finals.<br /><br />\n10<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br /><br />\nWhat is causing a great deal of talk<br />\naround the University at present is the date<br />\nset for the dual track and field meet with<br />\nthe University of Virginia, which coincides<br />\nexactly with the date of the Hopkins-Swarthmore lacrosse game.<br />\nAlthough Hopkins chances of winning in<br />\neither contest will not be affected, since the<br />\npersonnel of the two teams is entirely distinct, yet the date settled upon is causing<br />\nnot a little talk because of the fact that in<br />\nformer years the students have been attending both events in a body, whereas this time<br />\nthey will be able to see only one event.<br />\nThis date is not at all satisfactory to the<br />\nathletic authorities, but it was the only one<br />\nthe University of Virginia would agree to,<br />\nso there was but one course to pursue, either<br />\naccept this date or call off the meet entirely,<br />\nwhich the athletic authorities were unwilling to do.<br /><br />\nPROGRESS IN THE CHESS<br />\nTOURNAMENT.<br />\nRound Three\u2014Dr. MacInnes defeated B.<br />\nA.

He had married at the end<br />\nof the 1903 season, but as he was fond of<br />\nracing, came back to improve his knowledge<br />\nof horses by a year in the Veterinary School.<br />\nI go into these details because some persons have alleged that he returned to college<br />\nfor football only, a calumny disproved<br />\n\"prima facie.\"<br /><br />\nStripp, at right guard for Yale, is the only<br />\nman for the position on the All-America.<br />\nHe served seven years in the University of<br />\nCalifornia, then came to Yale, as many Western boys do, to finish his education. He<br />\ntackles hard, is a dangerous man to handle,<br />\nand is of great assistance to the runner.<br />\nThe other guard was a hard proposition<br />\nto settle, but all the ladies voted for Skinney,<br />\nso I have put him on. He tackles hard, is<br />\na dangerous man to handle, and is of great<br />\nassistance to the runner.<br />\nFor the tackle positions there can be but<br />\ntwo names in the minds of followers of football\u2014Bloomers and Shogun. Bloomers<br />\nplayed two years ago on the Yale Team,<br />\nbut after the football season was strongly<br />\nadvised by the Dean to go away for his<br />\nhealth. He returned this year to be a terror<br />\nto his opponents. He tackles hard, is a<br />\ndangerous man to handle, and is of great<br />\nassistance to the runner. Captain Shogun,<br />\nwhose playfulness off the field of battle has<br />\nearned him the soubriquet of \"Rough House<br />\nMike,\" was fifteen years ago the star prep.<br />\nschool player of the East. He was debarred<br />\nby an accident from entering college immediately, but after long study passed the admission exams for the Dental School.

Shovelin is undoubtedly the man for<br />\nright end. A prep. school athlete, he was<br />\nintending to enter Princeton, but happening<br />\none day to see a picture of Yale University,<br />\nhe was so struck with it that he changed his<br />\nmind and made the football Team in his<br />\nFreshman year. IIe tackles hard, is a dangerous man to hand,le, and is of great assistance t othe runner.<br />\nNo back field, we may venture to say,<br />\never showed such speed, dash, and brilliancy<br />\nas that which has just made Yale's 1904<br />\nTeam famous. They all tackle hard, are<br />\ndangerous men to handle, and are of great<br />\nassistance to the runner. Justice compels<br />\nus to put T. H. Tinkel, of the Springfield<br />\nStrength College, at left end.

Price, 85 cents, net.<br />\nIn view of the brief while now remaining<br />\nbefore the distinguished author of this little<br />\nvolume will sever his connection with the<br />\nUniversity, in order to take up his duties<br />\nas regius professor of medicine at Oxford,<br />\nthe contents of \"Science and Immortality\"<br />\nshould possess unusual interest for Hopkins<br />\nmen. In a word, the book is a confession<br />\nof faith of the writer, the fidei confessio of<br />\na great physician. It does not pretend to<br />\ntake up the vast subject of immortality, and<br />\ndissect it; nor does it attempt either to<br />\nprove or disprove the existence of a life<br />\nafter death. It aims to be rather an epitome<br />\nof the feelings of the world upon the subject, as seen from the stand-point of a man<br />\nof science, a stand-point which, never obtruding itself, is yet always felt by the<br />\nreader.<br />\nThe book is merely the printed form of a<br />\nspeech deliVered at Harvard University last<br />\nyear by Dr. Osier in his capacity of Ingersoll<br />\nlecturer for 1904. Under the will of Miss<br />\nCaroline IIaskell Ingersoll, of New Hampshire, there was established at Harvard University, in 1893, the \"Ingersoll Lectureship<br />\non the Immortality of Man.\" The lectureship provides for one lecture each year, and<br />\nhas been filled upon each occasion by men of<br />\nthe highest intellectual rank. Dr. Osier is<br />\nthe first physician upon whom the honor has<br />\never been conferred.<br />\nThe lecture is divided into three parts,<br />\nentitled respectively, \"The Laodicians,\"<br />\n\"The Gallionians,\" and \"The Teresians.\"<br />\nThese are simply names for the classes into<br /><br />\nwhich Dr. Osier divides society. The Laodicians is anotheri word for those who are<br />\nindifferent to religion.<br />\n\"Indifference,\"<br />\nsays Dr. Osier, \"is the modern attitude of<br />\nmind.\" The Gallionians are those who deliberately put the matter aside as one about<br />\nwhich they neither know nor have any<br />\nmeans of knowing anything; who live<br />\n\"wholly uninfluenced by a thought of a<br />\nhereafter.\" The Teresians, \"the only people who have ever had perfect satisfaction,\"<br />\nare those \"who walk by faith and not by<br />\nsight.\"<br />\nThe author takes up each of these classes<br />\nseparately, defines its position, tells the conditions which produce it, but never moralizes. There is a total absence of preaching.<br />\nExisting conditions are stated; the drawing<br />\nof conclusions is left entirely to the reader.<br />\nLike all Dr. Osier's writings, the diction is<br />\nexact and the style pure and fluent. The<br />\nbook is a perfect store-house of quotations.<br />\nEvery other line sparkles with a gem from<br />\nsome ancient or modern classic.

This<br />\nwill include graduates of high schools, academies, Latin schools and such private schools<br />\nas prepare for college. The former rule<br />\nthat a candidate must have completed at<br />\nleast two years in a college or university<br />\nwas made by the trustees of the Rhodes'<br />\nwill, but they have given the State committees the option of changing it, as has<br />\nbeen done in this case by the Massachusetts<br />\ncommittee.
