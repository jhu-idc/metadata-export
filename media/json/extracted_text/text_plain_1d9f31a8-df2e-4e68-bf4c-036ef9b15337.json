D. 370).<br />\nThis novel parallelism points,<br />\nhowever, to the further fact that<br />\nthe attitude of the two poets towards Roman imperialism and the<br />\nworld-historic mission of Roman<br />\ncivilization and culture can be<br />\ncalled identical. Ausonius, the<br />\nGallic provincial at the royal resi(lence Trier (Treves)\u2014at that time<br />\na more important administrative<br />\ncenter than Rome\u2014praised Greater Rome as the basis of all possible European civilization, and<br />\nhis \"Mosella\" must be called the<br />\nEpic of reminiscence and anticipation, on this theme. Martial's<br />\npoem on \"Caesar's Tree\" at Cordova) was shown to convey an<br />\nidea of Greater Rome quite in<br />\nharmony with that of Ausonius,<br />\nand with very similar imagery<br />\nand illustration, from the point of<br />\nview of the Spanish provincial.<br />\nOpitz, writing in Liebenbiirgen.<br />\nthe ancient Dacia, with the events<br />\nrecorded on Trajan's column in<br />\nhis mind, with Roman monuments<br />\nbefore his eyes, and with the relics<br />\nof the \"lingua Romana\" assailing<br />\nhis ears, constructed his epic of<br />\nreminiscence a n d anticipation<br />\n\"Zlatna\" from a similar point of<br />\nview, save that the world in which<br />\nhe longed to see it realized was to<br />\nbe a new German literature of distinctly national type, but with latinized amenities of spiritual outlook and poetical expression.<br />\nThese organic lines of development from Ausonius to Opitz were<br />\nthen contrasted with Ronsard's dynastic derivation of his eponymous<br />\nnational hero Francus, through<br />\nthe Dictys and Dares legend of<br />\nTroy, from Hector, son of Priam.<br />\nNot content with this conventionalized geneological tree for \"La<br />\nPleiade,\" Ronsard fabled in his<br />\nautobiographical notes of an ancestor of his own, from the Lower<br />\nDanube, whose journey to France<br />\nthrough Hungary and Germany in<br />\nthe fourteenth century to the aid<br />\nof the French king, Philippe VI,<br />\n<br />\nDr. David M.

This decrease is principally in the number of graduates.<br />\n\u2022 Of the new students there are<br />\n76 graduates, 149 undergraduates<br />\nand 119 medical men. Of the 149<br />\nundergraduate freshmen, 85 are<br />\npursuing the acadeplic course, 56<br />\nthe engineering course and 8 are<br />\nspecial students.<br />\nBaltimore City College supplied<br />\nnearly 50 freshmen, a larger number than that from any other<br />\nschool; the Polytechnic Institute<br />\nsent 20 men, and the other Baltimore \"prep\" schools furnished all<br />\ntogether 26 men.<br />\nFour of the class officers came<br />\nfrom Baltimore schools. George<br />\nCarey, president, and F. E. Pegram, treasurer, studied at the University School for Boys. John<br />\nMarcuse, from John Marshall<br />\nHigh School of Richmond, is the<br />\nvice-president. R. G. Heiner, secretary, prepped at St. James'<br />\nSchool and Elmer Jones, sergeantat-arms, at Baltimore City College. It has been a noticable fact<br />\nthat for the first time in many<br />\nyears only one office in the Freshman Class is held by a City College man instead of them all.<br />\n<br />\ncorresponds in all essential particulars with the argonautica of<br />\nFrancus as described in \"La<br />\nFranciade\" (1572). With these<br />\nguiding points in mind, it is readily perceived that Ronsard's poem<br />\nis in reality no epic, but a poem<br />\nwith epic machinery corresponding essentially with the Old<br />\nFrench \"Roman de Troie.\" In<br />\nRonsard's hands the strenuous<br />\nimperial Renaissance conception<br />\nof Greater Rome, as expressed by<br />\nMartial, Ausonius and Opitz, is exchanged for a softer ideal of<br />\nFrench loveliness, \"la douceur angevine.\" French literature, from<br />\n\"La Franciade\" to Voltaire's \"La<br />\nHenriade,\" lost through this<br />\nchange all organic connection<br />\nwith genuine epic poetry, gaining<br />\ninstead the lyrics of \"La Pleiade,\"<br />\nwhich restored to literature \"an<br />\nall but lost delight.\" The muse of<br />\nOpitz could confer no such magic<br />\ngifts, moving as she did through<br />\nthe lower ranges of poetry. But<br />\nby his faithful preservation of<br />\nthe Renaissance epic idea,. Opitz<br />\nin a measure prepared the way for<br />\nGoethe. In his \"Hermann und<br />\nDorothea,\" the action of which<br />\ntakes place, in the very next German province to that in which<br />\nTrier is situated, Goethe outdid<br />\nthe \"Mosella\" as a Renaissance<br />\nepic of reminiscence and anticipation, while adding a new national content, and founding a<br />\nnew German Classicism.<br />\n<br />\nVIRGINIA FAVORS TRIANGLE;<br />\nFRESH-SOPH DEBATE IN VIEW<br />\n<br />\nThe University of Virginia has<br />\nsent word that it is anxious to restore the annual triangular debate<br />\nbetween Hopkins, Virginia and<br />\nNorth Carolina, and it is very<br />\nprobable that North Carolina will<br />\nvery soon make known its willingness to do likewise. Consequently,<br />\nthe outlook for debating is brighter than it has been for sometime.<br />\nThe Debating Council will hold a<br />\nmeeting next week to decide upon<br />\na subject and to make final arrangements.

It is expected that only a few weeks will<br />\nelapse before the routine work of<br />\nelementary training is accomplished, and the more interesting<br />\nadvanced work is begun.<br />\nThere has been considerable discussion, among the men since the<br />\nthe parade last Wednesday, with<br />\nregard to a distinctive color for<br />\nthe battalion. This need was emphasized by the difficulty spectators had in giving the right name<br />\nto the battalion while on the<br />\nmarch. The unit was taken for<br />\neverything f rom preparatory<br />\nschool cadets to a part of the<br />\nRegular Army. Designs are being<br />\ncohsidered for a distinctive battalion flag, and it is hoped that it<br />\nwill be soon provided.<br />\n<br />\nOFFERS INTERESTING SUBJECTS<br />\nB. S. Degree Given in Teachers' College<br />\nCourses for Sufficient Number<br />\nof Points\u2014Open to Undergraduates.<br />\n<br />\nThe college courses for teachers,<br />\nwhich commenced this year officially on October 18, include<br />\nsome of the most interesting and<br />\nimportant groups of courses being given in the University. With<br />\nan enrollment of well over three<br />\nhundred, they far surpass in point<br />\nof numbers either the engineering school or .the academic department. The degree of bachelor of<br />\nscience is given to those enrolled<br />\nin the teachers' courses who complete sufficient courses to obtain<br />\nthe required number of credits.<br />\nDespite the war situation, the<br />\nnumber of candidates for the degree has increased over that of<br />\nlast year.<br />\nThe courses are open to undergraduate students, about twenty<br />\nof whom have availed themselves<br />\nof the opportunity. A number of<br />\nthese are engineering students<br />\nwho are taking one or another of<br />\nthe English courses. A number<br />\nof graduate students, including<br />\nseveral from the Medical School,<br />\nare also enrolled, many of them<br />\nendeavoring in this way to pass<br />\noff a condition which stands in<br />\nthe way of a doctor's degree. The<br />\nmajority of the graduates are taking French or German.<br />\nDr. Buchner, the director of the<br />\nteachers' courses, in an interview<br />\nwith a representative of THE<br />\nNEWS-LETTER, pointed out the<br />\nmany occupations represented by<br />\nthose attending the classes. \"In<br />\naddition to teachers,\" he said,<br />\n\"and to the undergraduate, graduate and Medical School students,<br />\nthere are enrolled State and city<br />\nofficials, lawyers, engineers, physicians, nurses and clergymen.\"<br />\nThirty-four courses are given<br />\nthis year, some in the afternoon<br />\nand some at night. They include<br />\ncourses in art, chemistry, philosophy, history, education, political<br />\nscience, political economy, drawing, English, French, German,<br />\nSpanish and Oriental languages.<br />\nThe new courses are highly interesting. Dr. Slonimsky is conducting one on the history of philosophy; Dr. Latane will give another in American diplomacy; and<br />\na third will be under the leadership of Dr. Robinson, on Greek<br />\nsculpture. In co-operation with<br />\nthe Baltimore Board of School<br />\nCommissioners, Dr. Gilpin has introduced a night course in organic<br />\nchemistry for domestic science<br />\nteachers. There will also be a survey course in English literature,<br />\nunder Dr;Powell; a course in European drama, under Dr. Gay; a<br />\nclass conducted by Dean Brush on<br />\nFrench literature since 1870; another in practical French, under<br />\nDr. Grfinbaum, formed by special<br />\nrequest; and a course in drawing.<br />\n<br />\n\fTHE JOHNS HOPKINS NEWS\u2014LETTER, OCTOBER 29, 1917.<br />\n<br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER'S MAIL BAG<br />\n<br />\npurpose for which it is intended,<br />\ncannot possibly be expected to<br />\n\u2022 A Column in Which the Correspondents serve the purpose of a distinguishing device for the battalion as a<br />\nAre Allowed Latitude, but Shoulwhole.

D. 370).<br />\nThis novel parallelism points,<br />\nhowever, to the further fact that<br />\nthe attitude of the two poets towards Roman imperialism and the<br />\nworld-historic mission of Roman<br />\ncivilization and culture can be<br />\ncalled identical. Ausonius, the<br />\nGallic provincial at the royal resi(lence Trier (Treves)\u2014at that time<br />\na more important administrative<br />\ncenter than Rome\u2014praised Greater Rome as the basis of all possible European civilization, and<br />\nhis \"Mosella\" must be called the<br />\nEpic of reminiscence and anticipation, on this theme. Martial's<br />\npoem on \"Caesar's Tree\" at Cordova) was shown to convey an<br />\nidea of Greater Rome quite in<br />\nharmony with that of Ausonius,<br />\nand with very similar imagery<br />\nand illustration, from the point of<br />\nview of the Spanish provincial.<br />\nOpitz, writing in Liebenbiirgen.<br />\nthe ancient Dacia, with the events<br />\nrecorded on Trajan's column in<br />\nhis mind, with Roman monuments<br />\nbefore his eyes, and with the relics<br />\nof the \"lingua Romana\" assailing<br />\nhis ears, constructed his epic of<br />\nreminiscence a n d anticipation<br />\n\"Zlatna\" from a similar point of<br />\nview, save that the world in which<br />\nhe longed to see it realized was to<br />\nbe a new German literature of distinctly national type, but with latinized amenities of spiritual outlook and poetical expression.<br />\nThese organic lines of development from Ausonius to Opitz were<br />\nthen contrasted with Ronsard's dynastic derivation of his eponymous<br />\nnational hero Francus, through<br />\nthe Dictys and Dares legend of<br />\nTroy, from Hector, son of Priam.<br />\nNot content with this conventionalized geneological tree for \"La<br />\nPleiade,\" Ronsard fabled in his<br />\nautobiographical notes of an ancestor of his own, from the Lower<br />\nDanube, whose journey to France<br />\nthrough Hungary and Germany in<br />\nthe fourteenth century to the aid<br />\nof the French king, Philippe VI,<br /><br />\nDr. David M. Robinson, vicepresident of the Baltimore Society<br />\nof the Archaeological Institute of<br />\nAmerica, has announced an illustrated lecture that is expected to<br />\nbe of the greatest interest to the<br />\nmen of the University. Prof. Victor Horta, A. R. B., of Belgium,<br />\non Thursday, November 1, 1917,<br />\nat 4.30 o'clock, in the Civil Engineering Building, will tell of what<br />\nthe Germans have done to his native land; his subject being \"The<br />\nCathedrals and Public Buildings<br />\nof Northern France as Affected by<br />\nthe War.\"<br />\nThough the story of the martyr<br />\ncountry of the Great War is appealing in itself, added interest is<br />\ngiven it by the fact that it is to be<br />\ntreated by such a prominent man<br />\nas Dr. Horta.<br />\nProfessor Horta is honorary<br />\nprofessor and dean of the Royal<br />\nSchool of Fine Arts, Brussels; a<br />\nmember of the Academie Belgique,<br />\nknight of the Order of De Leopold<br />\nand Norton Memorial Lecturer for<br />\n1917 on the Loeb Foundation.<br />\nDr. Robinson will preside in the<br />\nabsence of Dr. Magoffin, who is<br />\nnow a captain in the Quartermaster's Corps and stationed at<br />\nColumbia, S. C.<br /><br />\nThe latest official figures from<br />\nthe Registrar's office give the number of undergraduates as 368, the<br />\nmedical students 370, and the<br />\ngraduate students 153. Compared<br />\nwith last year's enrollment, there<br />\nis a decrease of 7/<br />\n1<br />\n2 per cent.,<br />\nwhich is due to the many enlistments. This decrease is principally in the number of graduates.<br />\n\u2022 Of the new students there are<br />\n76 graduates, 149 undergraduates<br />\nand 119 medical men. Of the 149<br />\nundergraduate freshmen, 85 are<br />\npursuing the acadeplic course, 56<br />\nthe engineering course and 8 are<br />\nspecial students.<br />\nBaltimore City College supplied<br />\nnearly 50 freshmen, a larger number than that from any other<br />\nschool; the Polytechnic Institute<br />\nsent 20 men, and the other Baltimore \"prep\" schools furnished all<br />\ntogether 26 men.<br />\nFour of the class officers came<br />\nfrom Baltimore schools. George<br />\nCarey, president, and F. E. Pegram, treasurer, studied at the University School for Boys. John<br />\nMarcuse, from John Marshall<br />\nHigh School of Richmond, is the<br />\nvice-president. R. G.

It has been a noticable fact<br />\nthat for the first time in many<br />\nyears only one office in the Freshman Class is held by a City College man instead of them all.<br /><br />\ncorresponds in all essential particulars with the argonautica of<br />\nFrancus as described in \"La<br />\nFranciade\" (1572). With these<br />\nguiding points in mind, it is readily perceived that Ronsard's poem<br />\nis in reality no epic, but a poem<br />\nwith epic machinery corresponding essentially with the Old<br />\nFrench \"Roman de Troie.\" In<br />\nRonsard's hands the strenuous<br />\nimperial Renaissance conception<br />\nof Greater Rome, as expressed by<br />\nMartial, Ausonius and Opitz, is exchanged for a softer ideal of<br />\nFrench loveliness, \"la douceur angevine.\" French literature, from<br />\n\"La Franciade\" to Voltaire's \"La<br />\nHenriade,\" lost through this<br />\nchange all organic connection<br />\nwith genuine epic poetry, gaining<br />\ninstead the lyrics of \"La Pleiade,\"<br />\nwhich restored to literature \"an<br />\nall but lost delight.\" The muse of<br />\nOpitz could confer no such magic<br />\ngifts, moving as she did through<br />\nthe lower ranges of poetry. But<br />\nby his faithful preservation of<br />\nthe Renaissance epic idea,. Opitz<br />\nin a measure prepared the way for<br />\nGoethe. In his \"Hermann und<br />\nDorothea,\" the action of which<br />\ntakes place, in the very next German province to that in which<br />\nTrier is situated, Goethe outdid<br />\nthe \"Mosella\" as a Renaissance<br />\nepic of reminiscence and anticipation, while adding a new national content, and founding a<br />\nnew German Classicism.<br /><br />\nVIRGINIA FAVORS TRIANGLE;<br />\nFRESH-SOPH DEBATE IN VIEW<br /><br />\nThe University of Virginia has<br />\nsent word that it is anxious to restore the annual triangular debate<br />\nbetween Hopkins, Virginia and<br />\nNorth Carolina, and it is very<br />\nprobable that North Carolina will<br />\nvery soon make known its willingness to do likewise. Consequently,<br />\nthe outlook for debating is brighter than it has been for sometime.<br />\nThe Debating Council will hold a<br />\nmeeting next week to decide upon<br />\na subject and to make final arrangements. The subject finally<br />\ndecided upon and the date for<br />\ntryouts will be announced in THE<br /><br />\nNEWS-LETTER.<br />\nThe idea of a freshman team<br />\nand a freshman-sophomore debate<br />\nhas proved evry popular, and there<br />\nis a strong possibility that the<br />\nidea will materialize.

Evidence of this is shown in the letter appearing above. Captain<br />\nGuild had readily accepted the<br />\nrequest that the corps take part<br />\nin the patriotic exhibition, and at<br />\n7.30 last Wednesday evening the<br />\ncorps was lined up at attention<br />\non St. Paul street, waiting for the<br />\nword to march.<br />\nThough just starting on its year<br />\nof training and containing a large<br />\nproportion of green men, the Hopkins corps was able by its soldierly appearance and precision in<br />\nholding lines to call forth cheers<br />\nall along the line of march. In<br />\nthe general orders of October 25th,<br />\nthe commandant commended the<br />\nbattalion on its excellent showing<br />\nin the parade, especially complimenting Company B for its excellent attendance record.<br />\nMembers of the Hopkins battalion who are candidates for commissions in the Reserve Corps of<br />\nthe Army will in future, during<br />\nthe third and fourth year of training, receive pay at the rate of 30<br />\ncents a day ration fee, according<br />\nto information received by Captain Guild from the War Department.

It is expected that only a few weeks will<br />\nelapse before the routine work of<br />\nelementary training is accomplished, and the more interesting<br />\nadvanced work is begun.<br />\nThere has been considerable discussion, among the men since the<br />\nthe parade last Wednesday, with<br />\nregard to a distinctive color for<br />\nthe battalion. This need was emphasized by the difficulty spectators had in giving the right name<br />\nto the battalion while on the<br />\nmarch. The unit was taken for<br />\neverything f rom preparatory<br />\nschool cadets to a part of the<br />\nRegular Army.

With<br />\nan enrollment of well over three<br />\nhundred, they far surpass in point<br />\nof numbers either the engineering school or .the academic department. The degree of bachelor of<br />\nscience is given to those enrolled<br />\nin the teachers' courses who complete sufficient courses to obtain<br />\nthe required number of credits.<br />\nDespite the war situation, the<br />\nnumber of candidates for the degree has increased over that of<br />\nlast year.<br />\nThe courses are open to undergraduate students, about twenty<br />\nof whom have availed themselves<br />\nof the opportunity. A number of<br />\nthese are engineering students<br />\nwho are taking one or another of<br />\nthe English courses. A number<br />\nof graduate students, including<br />\nseveral from the Medical School,<br />\nare also enrolled, many of them<br />\nendeavoring in this way to pass<br />\noff a condition which stands in<br />\nthe way of a doctor's degree. The<br />\nmajority of the graduates are taking French or German.<br />\nDr. Buchner, the director of the<br />\nteachers' courses, in an interview<br />\nwith a representative of THE<br />\nNEWS-LETTER, pointed out the<br />\nmany occupations represented by<br />\nthose attending the classes. \"In<br />\naddition to teachers,\" he said,<br />\n\"and to the undergraduate, graduate and Medical School students,<br />\nthere are enrolled State and city<br />\nofficials, lawyers, engineers, physicians, nurses and clergymen.\"<br />\nThirty-four courses are given<br />\nthis year, some in the afternoon<br />\nand some at night. They include<br />\ncourses in art, chemistry, philosophy, history, education, political<br />\nscience, political economy, drawing, English, French, German,<br />\nSpanish and Oriental languages.<br />\nThe new courses are highly interesting. Dr. Slonimsky is conducting one on the history of philosophy; Dr. Latane will give another in American diplomacy; and<br />\na third will be under the leadership of Dr. Robinson, on Greek<br />\nsculpture.
