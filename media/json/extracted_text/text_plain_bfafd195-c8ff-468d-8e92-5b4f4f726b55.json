To determine how this statement can<br />\nbe true, we must first interpret the meaning<br />\nof the word \"freshman.\"<br />\nA reputable dictionary describes a \"freshman\" as \"a college student in the first year of<br />\nthe course.\" According to this definition, the<br />\nonly determining factor is the time element.<br />\nBut after having been in college for two years<br />\nand having closely observed many students<br />\nduring that period we venture to disagree<br />\nwith accepted definitions of \"freshman.\"<br />\nBreaking the word into its component<br />\nparts we get, fresh man, which is about the<br />\nsimplest and best definition it is possible to<br />\nmake. Thus, we see that a freshman is a man<br />\nwho is new to the ways and ideas of the University, and is trying to become acclimated to<br />\nthem.<br />\nHow can a freshman become acclimated?<br />\nThis is a difficult question to answer because<br />\nits solution has to deal with mental rather<br />\nthan physical factors. But the closest we can<br />\ncome to it is to say that a man has not become<br />\nacclimated to the University until he has acquired the Hopkins Spirit. This inevitably<br />\nleads to the query, \"What is the Hopkins<br />\nSpirit'?\" And here we run into an obstacle<br />\nwhich we can't hurdle.<br />\nThe Hopkins Spirit is something intangible.

Louis is in the best tradition of a line that runs all the way<br />\ndown from Tom Devereaux, who wazAmerican champion in 1810, to tn,<br />\nelusive Kid Chocolate, last of th t<br />\ngreat dusky warriors. He has, it ap<br />\npears, all the skill of Peter Jackson<br />\nand Joe Gans, coupled with the power<br />\nof Sam Langford and Joe Wolcott.<br />\nHowever, Jack Johnson, now a portly<br />\nHarlem gin salesman and once holder of the crown universally conceded<br />\nto Louis, still keeps hi.\u00a7 place in the<br />\nsun. It is all of twenty years since<br />\nLil' Ahthah, still wearing the famous<br />\n\"golden smile\", eased his great length<br />\nto the canvas in response to a wild<br />\npush of Jess Willard's, and, with one<br />\nhuge arm upraised to keep off the<br />\nblazing Cuban sun, placidly heard<br />\nthe fatal count; yet the legend of his<br />\nprowess still runs through the dark<br />\nbelt. Johnson's timing is said to be<br />\nstill so remarkable that he can pick<br />\nflies out cif the air. Unlike Joe Louis,<br />\nhowever, he blazed no meteoric trail<br />\nto the top. In fact, during the early<br />\npart of his career, Johnson lost three<br />\nfights in one week.<br />\nALTHOUGH the obsequies may be<br />\na trifle premature, it appears at this<br />\nwriting as though the Chicago Cubs<br />\nare going to be the first of nineteen<br />\nhundred and thirty-five's \"destiny<br />\nriders\" to fail in achieving the ultimate triumphs. In a year which produced Sam Parks, Wilmer Allison,<br />\nand Jimmy Braddock, the men of<br />\nGrimm seem unable to overcome the<br />\ntwin bugaboos of bad luck and form.<br />\nA Cub victory would be a fitting climax to a topsy-turvy year, as well as<br />\nwarming the hearts of sports fans,<br />\nwho are romantics to the care.

To determine how this statement can<br />\nbe true, we must first interpret the meaning<br />\nof the word \"freshman.\"<br />\nA reputable dictionary describes a \"freshman\" as \"a college student in the first year of<br />\nthe course.\" According to this definition, the<br />\nonly determining factor is the time element.<br />\nBut after having been in college for two years<br />\nand having closely observed many students<br />\nduring that period we venture to disagree<br />\nwith accepted definitions of \"freshman.\"<br />\nBreaking the word into its component<br />\nparts we get, fresh man, which is about the<br />\nsimplest and best definition it is possible to<br />\nmake. Thus, we see that a freshman is a man<br />\nwho is new to the ways and ideas of the University, and is trying to become acclimated to<br />\nthem.<br />\nHow can a freshman become acclimated?<br />\nThis is a difficult question to answer because<br />\nits solution has to deal with mental rather<br />\nthan physical factors. But the closest we can<br />\ncome to it is to say that a man has not become<br />\nacclimated to the University until he has acquired the Hopkins Spirit. This inevitably<br />\nleads to the query, \"What is the Hopkins<br />\nSpirit'?\" And here we run into an obstacle<br />\nwhich we can't hurdle.<br />\nThe Hopkins Spirit is something intangible.

Louis is in the best tradition of a line that runs all the way<br />\ndown from Tom Devereaux, who wazAmerican champion in 1810, to tn,<br />\nelusive Kid Chocolate, last of th t<br />\ngreat dusky warriors. He has, it ap<br />\npears, all the skill of Peter Jackson<br />\nand Joe Gans, coupled with the power<br />\nof Sam Langford and Joe Wolcott.<br />\nHowever, Jack Johnson, now a portly<br />\nHarlem gin salesman and once holder of the crown universally conceded<br />\nto Louis, still keeps hi.\u00a7 place in the<br />\nsun.

Johnson's timing is said to be<br />\nstill so remarkable that he can pick<br />\nflies out cif the air. Unlike Joe Louis,<br />\nhowever, he blazed no meteoric trail<br />\nto the top.
