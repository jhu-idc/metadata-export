SRYGLEY<br />\nRecently in the Dayton Daily<br />\nNews-Journal Herald there was an<br />\narticle by Jim Fain on a recent<br />\nevent at Antioch college, nearby in<br />\nYellow Springs. In response to the<br />\ncurrent wave of streaking sweeping<br />\nthe country, ten male and five<br />\nfemale students stripped on the<br />\nsteps of Antioch Hall \u2014 and a<br />\ncompletely dressed male streaked<br />\nby, uninhibited by his outmoded<br />\nclothing. Mr. Fain quotes the<br />\norganizer of the demonstration as<br />\nremarking on \"Antioch's higher<br />\ncultural level compared to the<br />\nmany straight schools around the<br />\ncountry just now discovering<br />\nnudity.\"<br />\nIf only an insignificant<br />\ndemonstration, Antioch's display<br />\nwas at least an appropriate<br />\ncomment on one of Hopkins' more<br />\nbasic problems. Certainly this is a<br />\nstraight school, and there is<br />\nnothing wrong with that, if only its<br />\nstudents would remain constant<br />\nwith such a description. As the<br />\nrecent streaking indicates,<br />\nhowever, there are those<br />\nsubversives who would promote an<br />\natmosphere of lucidity, complete<br />\nwith nudity in the library.<br />\nUnfortunately, where this<br />\ncampaign seems to be going<br />\nsomewhere on other- campuses, at<br />\nHopkins there is only unisexual<br />\nnudity, albeit the one girl streaker<br />\non Friday. In fact, there are many<br />\nwould-be streakers walking around<br />\ntoday wondering who that young<br />\nlady was. It makes a<br />\ndifference...and that's the<br />\ndifference between Antioch and<br />\nHopkins.<br />\nI could thank all those who<br />\nstreaked, and all those who<br />\ncontributed the thousand dollars<br />\nto the Cancer Fund, but somehow<br />\nI just can't do it without<br />\nquestioning their real motives.<br />\nObviously the ends obtained by<br />\nthe streak are unquestionable and<br />\n<br />\nhousing<br />\nIt states in the Hopkins undergraduate catalog sonething to<br />\nthe effect that after a year of blitheful security in the<br />\nfreshman dorms, the party's over. At that point in time, the<br />\nUniversity, in keeping with its catalog-caricature of the<br />\nHopkins student as being independent, and self-reliant, lets<br />\ngo of the hand of the undergraduate and leaves him homeless<br />\non the streets of Baltimore with few palces to go for housing<br />\ncome next year.<br />\nSome students, quite understandably, might not know<br />\nhow to handle such a dilemma when thrust upon them. After<br />\nall, Baltimore's been known for some of the more lurid<br />\nfeatures that abound in most of America's bigger cities.<br />\nOthers might not want to take the time away from<br />\nChemistry or the laboratory to seek an apartment or<br />\nrowhouse. Inhabitable ones are not as easy to come by these<br />\ndays.<br />\nAnd so, the unfortunate undergraduate, looking to the<br />\nUniversity for accomodations, receives yet another slap in the<br />\nface - from its Housing Office when dealing with an<br />\nimconpetant administration. The student \"take-over\" of the<br />\nHousing Office's priority system with respect to University<br />\nhousing serves as a frightening illustration of administrative<br />\nincompetence.<br />\nThe action taken by the student to move to a sign-up<br />\nsystem automatically eliminated any threat from fellow<br />\nhousing-purveyors who, unaware of any such instituted<br />\npractice, have not yet made their pilgrimmage to the Housing<br />\nOffice.<br />\nkThis rather frightening display of desperation on the part<br />\nof student might have easily been qualmed and fairness of<br />\nsport restored had the Housing Director seen fit to throw out<br />\nthe sign-up system and insist on the students' leaving the<br />\nbuilding prior to a more reasonable hour.<br />\nDue to a lack of fortitude and insight on the part of those<br />\nresponsible, Wolman Hall became the scene of a giant<br />\nslumber party last night. And, for some, that might be the<br />\nlast of Unversity housing that they will experience.<br />\n<br />\nsome of my friends who streaked gain the better vantage point; I<br />\nwill admonish me for questioning would only like to ask the<br />\nthe means, but I cannot decide organizers if that was What they<br />\nwhether the Cancer drive was an had intended, and find out why<br />\nexcuse for another streak or vice they didn't pass the hat again after<br />\nversa. I cannot query the Fund the show. None of it seemed to<br />\npromoters their methods or their juxtapose with my conception of a<br />\nqualified success, but I would ask drive for a needy cause, but<br />\nthem if they could have raised so nothing's really changed.

It generally has<br />\na greater number of books and<br />\njournals to offer, but especially<br />\naround paper writing time when<br />\nthe Goucher library shelves are<br />\nwiped clean of books it is an<br />\nabsolute necessity to go elsewhere.<br />\nHopkins is easiest to get to, there's<br />\nfree transportation, and it's open<br />\ntwo hours longer than the Goucher<br />\nlibrary. And for what it's worth, it<br />\ndoes afford the Goucher students a<br />\nchange of scenery, which can be a<br />\nnecessity in itself.<br />\nI feel that it is most unfortunate<br />\nthat Goucher students must<br />\ntolerate the abusive labels (i.e.<br />\nhusband hunter pre-wed M.R.S.<br />\ncandidate, etc , etc., etc.) bestowed<br />\nupon them by the more ignorant<br />\nfactions at Hopkins, but to in fact<br />\nbe called such things by a fellow<br />\nGoucher student (of which I am<br />\nnot completely convinced) would<br />\nbe intolerable. It serves only to<br />\nperpetuate the very attitude most<br />\nof us are trying to dispell. All I can<br />\nsay is that I was very sorry to see<br />\nthat ridiculous letter printed.<br />\nLydia Bellia<br />\n<br />\nDick<br />\nTo the editor:<br />\nThe cry that student activism<br />\nhas given way to student apathy is<br />\nby now an overworked cliche, and<br />\nit was with little surprise that this<br />\nthreadbare idea appeared as the<br />\nmajor theme of Dick Waring's swan<br />\nsong. It is. however, distressing<br />\nthat Waring and his little band of<br />\njournalists. no doubt believing<br />\nwhat they read in Newsweek have<br />\ndone more to foster that sense of<br />\napathy than has anyone else on<br />\nthis particular campus. That a<br />\nNews-Letter reporter would not<br />\ndream of writing on \"abstract<br />\nissues like peace\" etc. reflects the<br />\n<br />\nbe lett to neneve that he is afraid<br />\n<br />\nk\\Ae.<br />\n<br />\ninterest<br />\nin events<br />\n\u2022<br />\n<br />\nand to create a<br />\n<br />\nclimate of activism and debate, not<br />\nmerely to drift placidly along<br />\nthrough doldrums.<br />\nThe major characteristic of the<br />\napathetic campus, according to<br />\nWaring, is students who \"have<br />\nbecome more concerned with their<br />\nown personal interests and likely<br />\nwould not involve themselves in<br />\nany activity that did not result in<br />\nimmediate and tangible personal<br />\nrewards.\" Hence, the News-Letter,<br />\nnever one to be at odds with<br />\nNewsweek's remote perceptions,<br />\nhas dealt with such burning issues<br />\nas the honor commission, the<br />\nmisadventures of Campus Patrol,<br />\nand the right to express oneself<br />\nthrough streaking. Nor is mere<br />\nmediocrity the News-Letter's sole<br />\nsin. The paper has gone out of its<br />\nway to douse whatever embers of<br />\nactivism there are on campus. In<br />\nthe very issue in which Waring<br />\ncomplains so much, a letter from<br />\nthe Committee on Human Rights<br />\nin Chile was not printed,<br />\nannouncing an important meeting<br />\nfor tonight, presumable to make<br />\nspace for the larger-than-life photo<br />\nof Waring's press card (suitable for<br />\nframing). Hopefully, that letter<br />\nwill appear, a bit belatedly, in this<br />\nissue. Nor was there any coverage<br />\nof Don Luce's excellent talk on the<br />\ncontinuing war in Viet Nam,<br />\nsponsored by the newly created<br />\nHopkins In do-China Peace<br />\nCampaign. One wonders if Hopkins<br />\nmight not be a more active place if<br />\npeople knew about these events...<br />\nWe hope the new editors will<br />\nfoster a greater spirit of activism<br />\non campus, and not just apologize<br />\nfor their inability to help<br />\nrejuvenate a dull campus.<br />\n<br />\n)<br />\n*W'\u2018N A7*/1\u2018<br />\n421/)<br />\n\u2022;17<br />\n\"<br />\n\u201dN<br />\n'<br />\n?<br />\n3 te ven<br />\nmailer heard<br />\n<br />\n'\"<br />\nk\u2018<br />\n<br />\nfrom<br />\n<br />\nsomebody else?\" First of all Andy<br />\nSavitz speaks and works for the<br />\nstudent body.

Time and again he<br />\ncame up with a strong save to kill<br />\npotential momentum-building<br />\nBlue Jay threats. At theother end<br />\nof the field, sophomore Mike<br />\nGodack had a trying day in his<br />\nfirst start in the Hopkins crease.<br />\nWith undue regularity, the<br />\nCavaliers unleashed open shots at<br />\npoint blank range which even the<br />\nbest could not have stopped.<br />\n\"We couldn't be more pleased<br />\nwith Godack's performance,\"<br />\nclaimed Coach Bob Scott. Often<br />\nin excellent position, Godack<br />\nturned aside 25 shots on goal<br />\nwhile Virginia maintained a<br />\n<br />\nseason.\" However, he feels that<br />\nthis year's freshman crop is not<br />\nquite as experienced as it has<br />\nbeen in the past.<br />\nWith this in mind, Coach<br />\nMcDermott anticipates a tough<br />\nseason going against a tough set<br />\nof opponents. \"I've reviewed all<br />\nthe matches of teams we faced<br />\nlast year and have found that<br />\neach team has 90% of its starters<br />\nback,\" commented Coach<br />\nMcDermott. \"It's hard facing<br />\nopponents like Delaware,<br />\nMaryland and Swarthmore. These<br />\nteams have indoor facilities<br />\nwhich allows them to play year<br />\nround. Before they come to<br />\nHomewood, they will have<br />\nplayed five to eight matches on a<br />\nsouthern trip.\"<br />\nDespite this seemingly<br />\npessimistic outlook, McDermott<br />\nnotes that after several weeks<br />\nworkout in the gym, his team is<br />\nin fairly good shape and if the<br />\nweather stays nice, they will have<br />\npractice outdoors in preparation<br />\nfor Friday's opener.

Of that group only<br />\none is a senior so the future looks<br />\nbright for the continued success<br />\nof the Hopkins swimming<br />\nprogram. However that senior's<br />\nsuit will be a hard one to fill<br />\nbecause Bill Milne is currently<br />\nwearing it. Milne will be<br />\ndefending personal<br />\nchampionships in the NCAA's<br />\nthis weekend. The Alubuquerque<br />\nstandout won titles in the 200<br />\nyard individual medley, the 100<br />\nyard butterfly, and the 200 yard<br />\nbutterfly. This year lie will also<br />\nbe swimming in all three relay<br />\nevents.<br />\nA trio of juniors, Mark<br />\nHorning, Tom Stenovec and Jim<br />\nFinnerty add their talents to the<br />\nHopkins contingent. Horning will<br />\nbe defending his title in the 100<br />\nyard backstroke, as well as<br />\nswimming the 200 yard<br />\nindividual medley and the 200<br />\nyard backstroke. Although<br />\nStenovec missed most of the<br />\nseason because of a broken hand,<br />\n<br />\nlie still qualified for three events.<br />\nHe will be competing in two<br />\nevents he has placed in<br />\npreviously, the 1650 yard<br />\nfreestyle and the 400 yard IM. In<br />\naddition, lie qualified in the 200<br />\nyard IM, an event new to him<br />\nthis year. Finnerty will be<br />\nmaking his third appearance at<br />\nthe nationals although he hasn't<br />\nplaced in previous outings. He'll<br />\nbe swimming the 50, 100 and<br />\n200 yard freestyles as well as the<br />\nlead leg of the 400 yard freestyle<br />\nrelay. According to Coach<br />\nComfort, \"He's been swimming<br />\nvery well.\"<br />\nTwo sophomores and three<br />\nfreshmen complete the swimming<br />\nroster.

In the<br />\n880 yard run, lettermen Chuck<br />\nMick and freshman Carig Synder<br />\nlook strong. Andy Schreiber has<br />\nthe upper hand in the quarter<br />\nmile with Earl Dryer close<br />\nbehind. The sprints also appear<br />\nstrong with letterman Lon<br />\nMassaglia and newcomer Brett<br />\nMiles running.<br />\nPerhaps the strongest area of<br />\ncompetition for the Jays is the<br />\nfield events.

Last year, Schreiber<br />\nplaced third in the long jump at<br />\nthe MAC championship.

SRYGLEY<br />\nRecently in the Dayton Daily<br />\nNews-Journal Herald there was an<br />\narticle by Jim Fain on a recent<br />\nevent at Antioch college, nearby in<br />\nYellow Springs. In response to the<br />\ncurrent wave of streaking sweeping<br />\nthe country, ten male and five<br />\nfemale students stripped on the<br />\nsteps of Antioch Hall \u2014 and a<br />\ncompletely dressed male streaked<br />\nby, uninhibited by his outmoded<br />\nclothing. Mr. Fain quotes the<br />\norganizer of the demonstration as<br />\nremarking on \"Antioch's higher<br />\ncultural level compared to the<br />\nmany straight schools around the<br />\ncountry just now discovering<br />\nnudity.\"<br />\nIf only an insignificant<br />\ndemonstration, Antioch's display<br />\nwas at least an appropriate<br />\ncomment on one of Hopkins' more<br />\nbasic problems. Certainly this is a<br />\nstraight school, and there is<br />\nnothing wrong with that, if only its<br />\nstudents would remain constant<br />\nwith such a description. As the<br />\nrecent streaking indicates,<br />\nhowever, there are those<br />\nsubversives who would promote an<br />\natmosphere of lucidity, complete<br />\nwith nudity in the library.<br />\nUnfortunately, where this<br />\ncampaign seems to be going<br />\nsomewhere on other- campuses, at<br />\nHopkins there is only unisexual<br />\nnudity, albeit the one girl streaker<br />\non Friday. In fact, there are many<br />\nwould-be streakers walking around<br />\ntoday wondering who that young<br />\nlady was. It makes a<br />\ndifference...and that's the<br />\ndifference between Antioch and<br />\nHopkins.<br />\nI could thank all those who<br />\nstreaked, and all those who<br />\ncontributed the thousand dollars<br />\nto the Cancer Fund, but somehow<br />\nI just can't do it without<br />\nquestioning their real motives.<br />\nObviously the ends obtained by<br />\nthe streak are unquestionable and<br /><br />\nhousing<br />\nIt states in the Hopkins undergraduate catalog sonething to<br />\nthe effect that after a year of blitheful security in the<br />\nfreshman dorms, the party's over. At that point in time, the<br />\nUniversity, in keeping with its catalog-caricature of the<br />\nHopkins student as being independent, and self-reliant, lets<br />\ngo of the hand of the undergraduate and leaves him homeless<br />\non the streets of Baltimore with few palces to go for housing<br />\ncome next year.<br />\nSome students, quite understandably, might not know<br />\nhow to handle such a dilemma when thrust upon them. After<br />\nall, Baltimore's been known for some of the more lurid<br />\nfeatures that abound in most of America's bigger cities.<br />\nOthers might not want to take the time away from<br />\nChemistry or the laboratory to seek an apartment or<br />\nrowhouse. Inhabitable ones are not as easy to come by these<br />\ndays.<br />\nAnd so, the unfortunate undergraduate, looking to the<br />\nUniversity for accomodations, receives yet another slap in the<br />\nface - from its Housing Office when dealing with an<br />\nimconpetant administration. The student \"take-over\" of the<br />\nHousing Office's priority system with respect to University<br />\nhousing serves as a frightening illustration of administrative<br />\nincompetence.<br />\nThe action taken by the student to move to a sign-up<br />\nsystem automatically eliminated any threat from fellow<br />\nhousing-purveyors who, unaware of any such instituted<br />\npractice, have not yet made their pilgrimmage to the Housing<br />\nOffice.<br />\nkThis rather frightening display of desperation on the part<br />\nof student might have easily been qualmed and fairness of<br />\nsport restored had the Housing Director seen fit to throw out<br />\nthe sign-up system and insist on the students' leaving the<br />\nbuilding prior to a more reasonable hour.<br />\nDue to a lack of fortitude and insight on the part of those<br />\nresponsible, Wolman Hall became the scene of a giant<br />\nslumber party last night. And, for some, that might be the<br />\nlast of Unversity housing that they will experience.<br /><br />\nsome of my friends who streaked gain the better vantage point; I<br />\nwill admonish me for questioning would only like to ask the<br />\nthe means, but I cannot decide organizers if that was What they<br />\nwhether the Cancer drive was an had intended, and find out why<br />\nexcuse for another streak or vice they didn't pass the hat again after<br />\nversa. I cannot query the Fund the show. None of it seemed to<br />\npromoters their methods or their juxtapose with my conception of a<br />\nqualified success, but I would ask drive for a needy cause, but<br />\nthem if they could have raised so nothing's really changed.

When I remember the have been a little more than<br />\nthree hundred or so cooing cranes slightly embarrassed if you had<br />\non the sidelines that night, asked them what they were so<br />\nstraining necks and elbowing to interested in? And if the streaking<br /><br />\nwas really the harmless success it<br />\nseems to be, judging by the waves<br />\nit's created, then where were the<br />\nlithe and illustrious proportion of<br />\nwomen? Surely a coeducational<br />\ninstitution such as Hopkins, full of<br />\nhealthy-minded young women,<br />\nthere would be an equal<br />\nproportion\u2014or a greater<br />\nproportion, considering the early<br />\nmaturity of girls as compared to<br />\nmales\u2014of long feline bodies among<br />\nthe incredible masculinity.

It generally has<br />\na greater number of books and<br />\njournals to offer, but especially<br />\naround paper writing time when<br />\nthe Goucher library shelves are<br />\nwiped clean of books it is an<br />\nabsolute necessity to go elsewhere.<br />\nHopkins is easiest to get to, there's<br />\nfree transportation, and it's open<br />\ntwo hours longer than the Goucher<br />\nlibrary. And for what it's worth, it<br />\ndoes afford the Goucher students a<br />\nchange of scenery, which can be a<br />\nnecessity in itself.<br />\nI feel that it is most unfortunate<br />\nthat Goucher students must<br />\ntolerate the abusive labels (i.e.<br />\nhusband hunter pre-wed M.R.S.<br />\ncandidate, etc , etc., etc.) bestowed<br />\nupon them by the more ignorant<br />\nfactions at Hopkins, but to in fact<br />\nbe called such things by a fellow<br />\nGoucher student (of which I am<br />\nnot completely convinced) would<br />\nbe intolerable. It serves only to<br />\nperpetuate the very attitude most<br />\nof us are trying to dispell. All I can<br />\nsay is that I was very sorry to see<br />\nthat ridiculous letter printed.<br />\nLydia Bellia<br /><br />\nDick<br />\nTo the editor:<br />\nThe cry that student activism<br />\nhas given way to student apathy is<br />\nby now an overworked cliche, and<br />\nit was with little surprise that this<br />\nthreadbare idea appeared as the<br />\nmajor theme of Dick Waring's swan<br />\nsong. It is. however, distressing<br />\nthat Waring and his little band of<br />\njournalists. no doubt believing<br />\nwhat they read in Newsweek have<br />\ndone more to foster that sense of<br />\napathy than has anyone else on<br />\nthis particular campus. That a<br />\nNews-Letter reporter would not<br />\ndream of writing on \"abstract<br />\nissues like peace\" etc. reflects the<br /><br />\nbe lett to neneve that he is afraid<br /><br />\nk\\Ae.<br /><br />\ninterest<br />\nin events<br />\n\u2022<br /><br />\nand to create a<br /><br />\nclimate of activism and debate, not<br />\nmerely to drift placidly along<br />\nthrough doldrums.<br />\nThe major characteristic of the<br />\napathetic campus, according to<br />\nWaring, is students who \"have<br />\nbecome more concerned with their<br />\nown personal interests and likely<br />\nwould not involve themselves in<br />\nany activity that did not result in<br />\nimmediate and tangible personal<br />\nrewards.\" Hence, the News-Letter,<br />\nnever one to be at odds with<br />\nNewsweek's remote perceptions,<br />\nhas dealt with such burning issues<br />\nas the honor commission, the<br />\nmisadventures of Campus Patrol,<br />\nand the right to express oneself<br />\nthrough streaking. Nor is mere<br />\nmediocrity the News-Letter's sole<br />\nsin. The paper has gone out of its<br />\nway to douse whatever embers of<br />\nactivism there are on campus. In<br />\nthe very issue in which Waring<br />\ncomplains so much, a letter from<br />\nthe Committee on Human Rights<br />\nin Chile was not printed,<br />\nannouncing an important meeting<br />\nfor tonight, presumable to make<br />\nspace for the larger-than-life photo<br />\nof Waring's press card (suitable for<br />\nframing). Hopefully, that letter<br />\nwill appear, a bit belatedly, in this<br />\nissue. Nor was there any coverage<br />\nof Don Luce's excellent talk on the<br />\ncontinuing war in Viet Nam,<br />\nsponsored by the newly created<br />\nHopkins In do-China Peace<br />\nCampaign. One wonders if Hopkins<br />\nmight not be a more active place if<br />\npeople knew about these events...<br />\nWe hope the new editors will<br />\nfoster a greater spirit of activism<br />\non campus, and not just apologize<br />\nfor their inability to help<br />\nrejuvenate a dull campus.<br /><br />\n)<br />\n*W'\u2018N A7*/1\u2018<br />\n421/)<br />\n\u2022;17<br />\n\"<br />\n\u201dN<br />\n'<br />\n?<br />\n3 te ven<br />\nmailer heard<br /><br />\n'\"<br />\nk\u2018<br /><br />\nfrom<br /><br />\nsomebody else?\" First of all Andy<br />\nSavitz speaks and works for the<br />\nstudent body.

If Raab truly<br />\nbelieves that it's time Muller heard<br />\nfrom somebody else, then I must<br />\nask him to first let the students<br />\nhear from him.

In the<br />\n880 yard run, lettermen Chuck<br />\nMick and freshman Carig Synder<br />\nlook strong. Andy Schreiber has<br />\nthe upper hand in the quarter<br />\nmile with Earl Dryer close<br />\nbehind. The sprints also appear<br />\nstrong with letterman Lon<br />\nMassaglia and newcomer Brett<br />\nMiles running.<br />\nPerhaps the strongest area of<br />\ncompetition for the Jays is the<br />\nfield events. Senior Al Schiff<br />\nheads the list of shotputters and<br />\nis hopeful of breaking the current<br /><br />\nHopkins shotput record this year.<br />\nJunior Lou Wolfin and freshman<br />\nGeorge Skegas head the way in<br />\nthe discus.

Last year, Schreiber<br />\nplaced third in the long jump at<br />\nthe MAC championship. Several<br />\nfreshmen are also looking<br />\nimpressive, particularly Chris<br />\nBeczak in the high jump and<br />\nMiles in the long jump.
