John was sitting in<br />\na chair, his legs crossed, his arms<br />\nfolded and his head back.<br />\nHe told us the story of his lacrosse<br />\ncareer. In 1935, his first year at City<br />\nCollege, John was fortunate enough<br />\nto make the varsity first team wing<br />\ndefense. This is a tough position for<br />\na 15 year old, tall, and lanky fellow<br />\nto hold. In the course of the season<br />\nhe injured his spine and was forced<br />\nto drop out for the rest of the season and to remain in bed for nine<br />\nmonths.<br />\nBecause of his injury he could not<br />\ntake part in Eppie's 1935 championship team. However, in 1936, wearing<br />\na brace on his back he returned to<br />\nthe old Indian game, hardy and full<br />\nof vim and vigor, ready to aid Eppie<br />\nto another championship.<br />\n\"This time, I took over the close-in<br />\nPost,\" said John, looking ever so<br />\noften over to Evans Sith who was<br />\nwriting something on the blackboard.<br />\n\"After winning the state championship we climaxed that season with<br />\na trip to New York and the National<br />\nLacrosse championship. The next season I returned as a veteran to the<br />\nteam. Again we won the national<br />\nchampionship. That ended my career<br />\nat City College.\"<br />\nJohn forgot to mention that both<br />\nyears that he played he was picked<br />\non the All Maryland high school team<br />\nas best bet.

The talk<br />\nhighlighted an informal reception for<br />\nDr Yin and Miss Pearl Teh-Wei Liu,<br />\nthe Chinese delegates to last summer's World Youth Congress.<br />\nAttacking Japan's official reasons<br />\nfor the invasion of China as false,<br />\nDr Yin accused the aggressor of reintroducing the wide spread of<br />\nopium, and of destroying China's<br />\ncultural institutions so as to keep<br />\nthe Chinese an ignorant subject<br />\nrace.<br />\n\"In 1937,\" said Dr Yin, \"80% of<br />\nthe Japanese farms were in debt,<br />\nwages dropped 20%, and the cost of<br />\nliving rose 25%. This economic crisis made an immediate foreign war<br />\nnecessary, and brought into operation Japan's program of world empire through domination of the Pacific ocean.\"<br />\nThe Chinese have won the war already, in strategy it was claimed by<br />\nDr Yin. \"We are bewildered by the<br />\nsight of our greatest friend sending<br />\nsupplies to Japan, but we feel that if<br />\nwe are able to keep on fighting we<br />\nwill be able to exhaust Japan's finan-<br /><br />\n... how fast that<br />\nsays itfor smokers...refreshing mildness.\u2022. better taste<br />\nmore pleasing aroma...<br />\neverything you could ask for in<br />\na cigarette<br /><br />\ncial resources.\"<br />\nIt was the 1931 invasion of China,<br />\nasserted Dr Yin, which set a precedent for the events in Ethiopia,<br />\nAustria, and Czechoslovakia. \"Those<br />\nincidents would not have followed if<br />\nManchuria had been settled in a different way.\"<br />\nDespite his generally optimistic<br />\nview of China's future, Dr Yin declared. \"The end of the war may mean<br />\ndestruction of two peoples and their<br />\nwork of centuries.\" '<br />\nMiss Liu, formerly a Shanghai<br />\nschool teacher, followed Dr Yin with<br />\na short sketch of the part played by<br />\nChinese women in the defense of<br />\ntheir country, and an appeal to the<br />\nwomen of America to boycott silk<br />\nstockings.
