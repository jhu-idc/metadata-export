He explained that producers of this<br />\ntype of material have been<br />\nprevented from doing experimental work by financial<br />\nconstraints. Organizations<br />\nwhich commission documentary work often pay very little<br />\nin view of the amount of time<br />\nrequired to produce an original<br />\nprogram. In addition, these<br />\norganizations often demand to<br />\nbe granted all rights to the work<br />\nin perpetuity, while only broadcasting it a few times, after<br />\nwhich time the tape \"sits on the<br />\nshelf,\" said Creagh.<br />\nThe programs to be aired will<br />\n<br />\neither be funded entirely by<br />\nWJHU or completed with funding from the station. The station will make its facilities for<br />\nturning \"raw tape\" into finished programs available to the<br />\nshows' producers; Creagh<br />\ndescribed the station as \"one of<br />\nthe best facilities in the counfor<br />\nthis \"posttry\"<br />\nproduction\" work.

This<br />\nproposal defeated two others<br />\nthat would have permitted a<br />\nCoalition-built shanty to be<br />\ntorn down.<br />\nBond said that early Monday<br />\nmorning, the wood used for the<br />\nshanty, dubbed \"Son of Shanty\" by the Coalition, was<br />\nsecretly brought onto campus<br />\n\"under security's eyes\" and<br />\nwas stored in Ames Hall.<br />\n\"We put the pieces in Ames<br />\nand then dropped them over the<br />\nledge,\" said Bond, referring to<br />\nthe stairs between Rowland and<br />\nAmes. When the trustees arrived at 11 a.m. they were greeted<br />\n<br />\nby the sight of posters, including one large banner hung<br />\non the pediment of Shriver<br />\nHall, and \"nets\" made of yarn<br />\nwhich covered many of the benches and trees on the lower<br />\nquads. One security guard stationed outside of Shriver Hall<br />\nduring the trustees' meeting<br />\ndescribed the trustees' arrival as<br />\n\"pretty orderly\" without incident from Coalition members.<br />\nAt 11:45 a.m. the Coalition<br />\nmembers had a scheduled<br />\nmeeting with the investment<br />\ncommittee and presented their<br />\nopinions on divestment.<br />\nAccording to Fisher, who<br />\nwas present at the meeting,<br />\n\"the finance committee of the<br />\nTrustees had a good talk with<br />\nthe Coalition this morning. It is<br />\nthe beginning of a very constructive dialogue, the kind of<br />\ndialogue that we'd like to see<br />\nmore of.\"<br />\nAfter the trustees broke for<br />\nlunch, the Coalition erected the<br />\nshanty. According to Bond, the<br />\nhammering went unnoticed<br />\nbecause, \"everyone must have<br />\nthought it was normal construction. It was all very exciting,\"<br />\nadded Bond.<br />\nThe roofless shanty was built<br />\non the lower quad and made<br />\nfrom remnants of the former<br />\nshanties, including the one that<br />\nwas firebombed. It was constructed quickly, according to<br />\nMichael Johns.<br />\nIn an interview Wednesday,<br />\nFisher said, \"Making a decision<br />\nto erect a shanty within a few<br />\nhours [of the meeting] was<br />\npremature. The trustees could<br />\nnot possibly have reacted in a<br />\nsubstative way within that time<br />\nperiod and to them, the act of<br />\nerecting a shanty under those<br />\ncircumstances could seem<br />\nstrongly confrontational.\"<br />\nEven some people who supported the Coalition felt that<br />\nthe shanty was limiting their<br />\nnegotiating power. Richard<br />\nCone, a professor of the<br />\nbiophysics department, who<br />\nacted as liaison between Jakie<br />\nHall and the Coalition warned<br />\nthe Coalition that the \"strong<br />\n<br />\npossibility\" of having a meeting<br />\nwith the administration would<br />\nnot materialize \"if the shanty<br />\ndoesn't come down.\"<br />\nIt was Cone, along with<br />\nDavid Harvey of the geography<br />\nand environmental engineering<br />\ndepartment, and Emily Martin<br />\nof the anthropology department that ran back and forth<br />\nthroughout the day shuttling<br />\nnews between Hall and the<br />\nCoalition.

Eisenhower<br />\nSymposium has oscillated dramatically,<br />\nHappily, M.S.E. Symposium '86 entitled Religion and Politics: The Separation<br />\nof Church and State, is apparently continuing the swing toward improvement<br />\nthat characterized the planning of last<br />\nyear's series,<br />\nThis year the Symposium, which was<br />\nfounded by students twenty-seven years<br />\nago in honor of former University President Milton S. Eisenhower, will feature<br />\ntwo nationally prominent figures wellknown for their positions with respect to<br />\nchurch/state issues, namely Pat Robertson and John Cardinal O'Connor. Three<br />\nlesser known but equally interesting<br />\nspeakers will complete the line-up.<br />\nConsidering the financial limitations<br />\nof the Symposium and the relatively<br />\nsmall audiences it can hope to attract, the<br />\nacquisition of at least two well-known<br />\nspeakers is certainly an accomplishment<br />\nfor M.S.E. Symposiufn Co-Chairmen,<br />\nZeid Raad and Paul Carliner. But<br />\nperhaps their greater accomplishment<br />\nhas been the careful selection of a wellbalanced range of speakers.<br />\nLast November when the church/state<br />\n<br />\ntopic was chosen and Zeid Raad, a<br />\nmember of the Jordanian royal family,<br />\nwas picked to be a co-chairman, a storm<br />\nof controversy broke out. Some critics<br />\nagrued that the Symposium might<br />\nbecome a forum for anti-Israeli propaganda. Even a cursory glance at the<br />\nlist of the speakers and their topics for<br />\nthis symposium reveals that those fears<br />\nwere groundless.<br />\nThe three keynote Shriver lecturers<br />\nthis year represent each of the three principal religious denominations in this<br />\ncountry. Furthermore, the two Garrett<br />\nRoom Seminars (a new addition to the<br />\nSymposium this year) will focus on fundamentalism using Islam and Judaism as<br />\ncase studies. The balance overall is<br />\ncommendable.<br />\nNo Symposium can hope to address<br />\ncompletely the range of issues suggested<br />\nby its topic, particularly when the topic<br />\nis as broad as the separation of church<br />\nand state. The best any Symposium can.<br />\ndo is to treat all sides of its topic evenhandedly.<br />\nThis year, with such a well-balanced<br />\nrange of symposium speakers, the<br />\nHopkins community can applaud Raad<br />\nand Carliner for a job well done.<br />\n<br />\nA Shameful Day<br />\nMonday, September 28 was a<br />\nshameful day for Hopkins indeed.<br />\nFor the first time in the history of this<br />\ninstitution, students were arrested for<br />\npeaceful demonstration. As Homewood<br />\nadministrators looked on, a contingent<br />\nof security forces dragged fourteen prodivestment protestors off to jail and<br />\ndemolished a protest shanty erected on<br />\nthe lower quad that day.<br />\nMonday's clash was an ugly<br />\nskirmish\u2014the kind of conflict no one<br />\nwants to witness. Fortunately, a decision<br />\nmade at an emergency meeting of the Executuve Committee of the Board of<br />\nTrustees late last night will likely prevent<br />\nthe kind of unsavory confrontation that<br />\noccu red Monday from happening in the<br />\nfuture.<br />\nAccording to the late-breaking decision (which comes on the eve of the<br />\nCoalition's newest scheduled shanty construction project) the Coalition will be<br />\nallowed to build a shanty or shanties on<br />\nthe lower quad provided that the structures meet applicable fire and safety<br />\nregulations and that no one inhabits<br />\nthem.<br />\nWe applaud that decision.<br />\nThe issue which has divided the Coalition and the administration all along can<br />\nbe traced to a conflict between two<br />\nspecific sets of concerns. On the one<br />\nhand, the Coalition has maintained that<br />\nits members have a right to protest the<br />\nUniversity's divestment policy. For the<br />\nCoalition, the physical safety of protesters has always been a secondary<br />\nconcern.<br />\n<br />\nThe administration, however, has insisted continually that safety must come<br />\nfirst and foremost. According to the administration, matters of safety can<br />\noutweigh freedom of speech concerns.<br />\nBoth sides have made very legitimate<br />\narguments. Strangely enough, both sides<br />\nalso seem to have been in fundamental<br />\nagreement all along concerning the importance of freedom of expression and<br />\nsafety. The only area of difference, until now, has been the priority that should<br />\nbe given to the two sets of concerns.<br />\nWith so much in common, it's surprising that the Coalition and the administration couldn't have reached a cordial settlement on the issue of shanty<br />\nconstruction earlier. All along, the administration simply should have allowed demonstrators to build protest shanties provided the shanties were structurally safe.<br />\nThe Coalition members for their part<br />\nshould have publically committed<br />\nthemselves to paying scrupulous attention to fire and safety laws.<br />\nThis morning, an impending sequel to<br />\nMonday's ignoble events seems to have<br />\nbeen averted. Reason has apparently<br />\ntriumphed over the brute force tactics used earlier this week.<br />\nWe can only hope that the latest decision to permit the construction of safe<br />\nprotest shanties will foreshadow a<br />\nclimate of cooperation between protestors and the University and prevent<br />\nunnecessary and mutually unproductive<br />\nhostilities in the future.<br />\n<br />\nNineteen eighty-five was the<br />\nyear when South Africa came<br />\nto the forefront of the electronic media's attention, and in<br />\nso doing, it galvanized the will<br />\nof many of our compatriots to<br />\nvoice their objections against<br />\nthe brutally unjust system of<br />\napartheid in South Africa.<br />\nPerhaps spearheading the<br />\nmovement of American antiapartheid activism are the<br />\nstudents of American universities. They more than any<br />\nother group have been able to<br />\nin a rather heavy handed way<br />\n<br />\ndivestment indignation to the<br />\nuniversity policy. This week's<br />\nunfortunate incident marks the<br />\nfirst time when force has been<br />\nused by the University--a move<br />\nthat can only greaten the rift.<br />\nWe are thus left at a<br />\ncrossroads of sorts, with the<br />\nCoalition fuming, and the<br />\nUniversity looking quite bad<br />\nfrom a political standpoint.<br />\nIt is quite unfortunate that it<br />\nshould come to this, for it is entirely obvious that Hopkins,<br />\nand indeed any university<br />\nshould be politically blind. To<br />\n<br />\njoseph chen<br />\nforce many universities to<br />\ndivest from companies doing<br />\nbusiness in South Africa.<br />\nThis University's student<br />\nbody is no exception, as a fair<br />\nminority of students and this<br />\nnewspaper have jumped on the<br />\nanti-apartheid bandwagon.<br />\nUnfortunately, the rhetoric<br />\nsurrounding this most important and serious of issues has<br />\nbeen of rather low quality as of<br />\nlate. Both the more leftist<br />\nCoalition for a Free South<br />\nAfrica, and the perhaps more<br />\nmoderate to right of center<br />\ntrustees of the University and<br />\nCollege Republicans have been<br />\noversimplifying the issue to the<br />\npoint of absurdity. Where the<br />\npro-divestment factions seem to<br />\nlack the sense to properly<br />\nevaluate the ramifications of<br />\ndivestment, the status quo affirmers seem to lack the \"milk<br />\nof human kindness.\"<br />\nThe on-campus conflict has<br />\nescalated with last May's<br />\nfirebombing, the subsequent<br />\nshanty banning, and pro-<br />\n<br />\npreserve the academic freedoms<br />\nthat we all enjoy, the University should not take the actively<br />\npolitical stance that divestment<br />\nwould entail. This is not to say<br />\nthat faculty members and<br />\nstudents should not be allowed<br />\nto express themselves freely in<br />\nthe manner that the Constitution sanctions, and act upon<br />\ntheir convictions. Rather, the<br />\nUniversity as an institution<br />\nwhich shelters a wide variety of<br />\npolitical viewpoints should not<br />\nengage in the politics of endorsing one side or another.<br />\nPolitics is a realm that the<br />\nuniversity was not designed<br />\nfor. By acting politically on<br />\nthis issue, many universities<br />\nhave set a dangerous<br />\nprecedent\u2014one that may<br />\nforfeit the sense of free expression now found on university<br />\ncampuses.

Bulletin boards add to<br />\nthe vitality of a university campus. They are a necessary<br />\nmeans of communication between students. Often a glance<br />\nat a crowded bulletin board can<br />\ninform a student quickly and<br />\neffectively of happenings on<br />\ncampus: sales, events, political<br />\nopinions and general news.

It has always been the<br />\nposition of the Board that<br />\nbulletin boards should be an effective means of communication for both students and student groups. The poster policy<br />\nrepresents an attempt to improve their effectiveness. What<br />\nhas been suggested is that the<br />\nboards be divided with a section<br />\nfor personal advertisements.<br />\nSecond, David Shade announced that the fines for illegal posters would be raised to<br />\n$20 for the first three posters<br />\nand $5 for each additional one.<br />\nWhile the idea was brought up<br />\nat the Board meeting, it was<br />\nnever voted upon or approved.<br />\nThus, the fine for illegal posters<br />\nis still $1 for each illegal poster.<br />\nNow, for the benefit of all<br />\nposterers on campus, the poster<br />\npolicy, as passed by the SAC<br />\nExecutive Board and Student<br />\nCouncil, is as follows:<br />\n1. All posters must be placed on bulletin boards only. Only one poster per board per<br />\nevent is permitted.<br />\n2. Each poster should have a<br />\nclearly marked expiration date.<br />\n3. Posters must be affixed<br />\nwith thumbtacks or tape, not<br />\nstaples.<br />\n4. A fine of one dollar will be<br />\nassessed for each illegal poster.<br />\nThis includes both posters that<br />\nare not on bulletin boards and<br />\nexcessive postering on a bulletin<br />\nboard. The money collected<br />\nwill go into a fund for purchasing new bulletin boards.<br />\nI hope this letter will clear up<br />\nany confusion about the poster<br />\npolicy.

This haphazard comparison between freedom of<br />\nreligion and expression of<br />\npolitical views is invidious. The<br />\nUniversity has continually<br />\ngranted the Jews on campus a<br />\nsite upon which to observe this<br />\nholiday. The threat to our<br />\nreligious practices inherent in<br />\nthe GRO's statement does<br />\nnothing but debase their antiapartheid arguments. A university is a place for both<br />\nreligious practice and intellectual debate.

Unfortunately<br />\nDavid Gitlitz, this is another<br />\nletter about divestment and<br />\napartheid. First of all, I hope<br />\nthat you read the interview of<br />\nPat Naidoo.<br />\nMr. Gitlitz, some of your<br />\nstatements were shamefully indefensible. How you attempt to<br />\ncompare the action of individuals (the \"slaughter of a<br />\n<br />\ncompletely innocent white<br />\nfamily\") with that of an entire<br />\nsystem of government is<br />\nbeyond me. Apartheid is a<br />\nsystematic denial of all humanness to an entire group of people based on color of their skin.<br />\nYour position on what you call<br />\n\"quick fix solutions\" shows<br />\nyour lack of understanding of<br />\nan issue you have been aware of<br />\nsince your sophomore year in<br />\nhigh school. For all of you out<br />\nthere who entertain the<br />\npossibility of the present racist<br />\nregime in South Africa<br />\npeacefully allowing the majority of South Africans the basic<br />\nrights of being human, I am<br />\nsorry to say that this will never<br />\nhappen.<br />\nAs Pat Naidoo stated in his<br />\ninterview, the situation is getting worse, not better. You see,<br />\nthe mind set of this racist<br />\nregime is that blacks are subhuman. They believe that it is<br />\ntheir divine destiny to rule over<br />\nthese \"savages.\" What fuels<br />\nthis mind set most is fear. Their<br />\nfear of having to deal with<br />\nblacks as equals will prevent<br />\nthem from ever negotiating to<br />\nrelease blacks from their<br />\nenslavement. Armed to the<br />\nteeth and backed by the most<br />\npowerful economic and<br />\nmilitary power in the world,<br />\nBotha and his people are more<br />\nthan willing to fight it out.<br />\nIt is because of this that<br />\ndivestment<br />\nmust<br />\nbe<br />\nundertaken.<br />\nThe Presbyterian Church of<br />\nthe U.S.A. put it this way: faced with an intractable situation,<br />\ndivestment is the only alternative. It has been shown that\u2022<br />\nincreased U.S. involvement is<br />\nnot the answer, as U.S. investment in South Africa increased<br />\n920 percent from 1960-1985,<br />\nContinued on Page 11<br />\n<br />\n\fNEWS-LETTER/11<br />\n<br />\nLetters<br />\nContinued from Page 10<br />\nand apartheid has only gotten<br />\nstronger. It has also been<br />\nshown that stock-holder resolutions are far from successful in<br />\ngetting U.S. companies to<br />\nwithdraw from South Africa.<br />\n(Because of the limit on space<br />\n1 can not provide you with the<br />\nevidence for this, but if you<br />\ndesire it, feel free to contact me)<br />\nThus, the situation for the investor is two-fold. Either keep<br />\nyour money in a firm that continues to provide vital economic<br />\nsupport to a racist regime, or<br />\nput your money elsewhere. This<br />\nis the dilemma that faces the<br />\nJ.H.U. Board of Trustees. As<br />\nthe Presbyterian Church put it,<br />\ndivestment is the only<br />\nalternative.<br />\nOne final Point: as long as injustices exist, those attempting<br />\nto bring attention to it have yet<br />\nto make their point.<br />\n<br />\nvestments in slavery, to plan to<br />\nattend the next coalition event.<br />\nBring a friend and show your<br />\nsupport\u2014it is now that you are<br />\nneeded most.

To<br />\nnon-member students, it also<br />\nprovides a social outlet in addition to those offered by other<br />\nUniversity groups.<br />\nAnother important aspect of<br />\nour Greek system is that it<br />\nbenefits various organizations<br />\nin the Baltimore area. Examples of this include: fundraisers and contributions to the<br />\nHeart Fund and Santa Claus<br />\nAnonymous, participation in<br />\nthe Big Brother and Sister Pro-<br />\n<br />\ngram of Maryland, volunteering at the Chimes School for<br />\nRetarded Children, supporting<br />\nfood drives and blood drives, as<br />\nwell as other philanthropic activities too numerous to<br />\nmention.<br />\nWe encourage the printing of<br />\nthis letter due to the fact that<br />\nmany readers may be unaware<br />\nof the positive effects that<br />\nfraternities/sororities have on<br />\nthe Hopkins community and<br />\nthe Baltimore community at<br />\nlarge.<br />\nIt is high time that something<br />\nother than the negative is<br />\npublicized about our Greek<br />\nsystem, as this is essential to the<br />\nsurvival of the much needed<br />\nHopkins Greek system.<br />\nThe Student Council of The<br />\nJohns Hopkins University passed a resolution formalizing its<br />\nsupport of Greek System and<br />\n<br />\nthe Inter-Fraternity Council.<br />\nWe hope that the balance of the<br />\nHopkins community and that<br />\nthe city if Baltimore will join in<br />\nthis show of support.<br />\nChristopher Verica<br />\nPres., Class of 1987<br />\nSusan J.

When<br />\ndebate was refused in the boardrooms, the students took the<br />\nissue to the campus grounds\u2014<br />\nto engage the campus community directly\u2014only to have<br />\nthe university clamp down in a<br />\nmanner perilously close to<br />\nviolence.

Unfortunately, it is not.<br />\nSouth Africa has been in the<br />\npast a target of sanctions. For<br />\nexample, South Africa has had<br />\nmilitary sanctions imposed<br />\nupon it by the U.N. for many<br />\nyears. As a result, the South<br />\nAfricans have shown unusual<br />\nresiliency. They have built their<br />\nmilitary industry to major proportions, producing arms that<br />\nequal or surpass the quality of<br />\nthose being produced in other<br />\nwestern countries.<br />\nSouth Africa is a largely self<br />\nsufficient country. They do not<br />\nneed the West. In reality, the<br />\nWest needs South Africa. It is<br />\nrivaled only by the Soviet<br />\nUnion in its production of<br />\nstrategic minerals and precious<br />\nmetals. Its mineral resources<br />\nare the heart of the South<br />\nAfrican economy. Divestment<br />\nand sanctions would be uncomfortable to the South Africans,<br />\nbut they would not hurt them.<br />\nThe value of South African<br />\n<br />\nmineral reserves would be forced upwards. In the end, the<br />\nSouth Africans would not lose<br />\nappreciably, as their metals will<br />\nfind their way to Western<br />\nmarkets by one route or<br />\nanother.<br />\nYet what might appear as<br />\nSouth Africa's strength is also<br />\nits greatest weakness. By using<br />\ngovernmental reserves to drive<br />\ndown the price of precious<br />\nmetals, the South African<br />\nwhites would be put under<br />\nmore pressure than would they<br />\nunder<br />\ndivestment<br />\nand<br />\nsanctions.<br />\nThe Coalition thus has not<br />\ncome to address the complexities of the larger issue.

He explained that producers of this<br />\ntype of material have been<br />\nprevented from doing experimental work by financial<br />\nconstraints. Organizations<br />\nwhich commission documentary work often pay very little<br />\nin view of the amount of time<br />\nrequired to produce an original<br />\nprogram. In addition, these<br />\norganizations often demand to<br />\nbe granted all rights to the work<br />\nin perpetuity, while only broadcasting it a few times, after<br />\nwhich time the tape \"sits on the<br />\nshelf,\" said Creagh.<br />\nThe programs to be aired will<br /><br />\neither be funded entirely by<br />\nWJHU or completed with funding from the station.

One security guard stationed outside of Shriver Hall<br />\nduring the trustees' meeting<br />\ndescribed the trustees' arrival as<br />\n\"pretty orderly\" without incident from Coalition members.<br />\nAt 11:45 a.m. the Coalition<br />\nmembers had a scheduled<br />\nmeeting with the investment<br />\ncommittee and presented their<br />\nopinions on divestment.<br />\nAccording to Fisher, who<br />\nwas present at the meeting,<br />\n\"the finance committee of the<br />\nTrustees had a good talk with<br />\nthe Coalition this morning.

According to Bond, the<br />\nhammering went unnoticed<br />\nbecause, \"everyone must have<br />\nthought it was normal construction. It was all very exciting,\"<br />\nadded Bond.<br />\nThe roofless shanty was built<br />\non the lower quad and made<br />\nfrom remnants of the former<br />\nshanties, including the one that<br />\nwas firebombed. It was constructed quickly, according to<br />\nMichael Johns.<br />\nIn an interview Wednesday,<br />\nFisher said, \"Making a decision<br />\nto erect a shanty within a few<br />\nhours [of the meeting] was<br />\npremature.

Eisenhower<br />\nSymposium has oscillated dramatically,<br />\nHappily, M.S.E. Symposium '86 entitled Religion and Politics: The Separation<br />\nof Church and State, is apparently continuing the swing toward improvement<br />\nthat characterized the planning of last<br />\nyear's series,<br />\nThis year the Symposium, which was<br />\nfounded by students twenty-seven years<br />\nago in honor of former University President Milton S. Eisenhower, will feature<br />\ntwo nationally prominent figures wellknown for their positions with respect to<br />\nchurch/state issues, namely Pat Robertson and John Cardinal O'Connor. Three<br />\nlesser known but equally interesting<br />\nspeakers will complete the line-up.<br />\nConsidering the financial limitations<br />\nof the Symposium and the relatively<br />\nsmall audiences it can hope to attract, the<br />\nacquisition of at least two well-known<br />\nspeakers is certainly an accomplishment<br />\nfor M.S.E. Symposiufn Co-Chairmen,<br />\nZeid Raad and Paul Carliner. But<br />\nperhaps their greater accomplishment<br />\nhas been the careful selection of a wellbalanced range of speakers.<br />\nLast November when the church/state<br /><br />\ntopic was chosen and Zeid Raad, a<br />\nmember of the Jordanian royal family,<br />\nwas picked to be a co-chairman, a storm<br />\nof controversy broke out. Some critics<br />\nagrued that the Symposium might<br />\nbecome a forum for anti-Israeli propaganda. Even a cursory glance at the<br />\nlist of the speakers and their topics for<br />\nthis symposium reveals that those fears<br />\nwere groundless.<br />\nThe three keynote Shriver lecturers<br />\nthis year represent each of the three principal religious denominations in this<br />\ncountry. Furthermore, the two Garrett<br />\nRoom Seminars (a new addition to the<br />\nSymposium this year) will focus on fundamentalism using Islam and Judaism as<br />\ncase studies. The balance overall is<br />\ncommendable.<br />\nNo Symposium can hope to address<br />\ncompletely the range of issues suggested<br />\nby its topic, particularly when the topic<br />\nis as broad as the separation of church<br />\nand state. The best any Symposium can.<br />\ndo is to treat all sides of its topic evenhandedly.<br />\nThis year, with such a well-balanced<br />\nrange of symposium speakers, the<br />\nHopkins community can applaud Raad<br />\nand Carliner for a job well done.<br /><br />\nA Shameful Day<br />\nMonday, September 28 was a<br />\nshameful day for Hopkins indeed.<br />\nFor the first time in the history of this<br />\ninstitution, students were arrested for<br />\npeaceful demonstration. As Homewood<br />\nadministrators looked on, a contingent<br />\nof security forces dragged fourteen prodivestment protestors off to jail and<br />\ndemolished a protest shanty erected on<br />\nthe lower quad that day.<br />\nMonday's clash was an ugly<br />\nskirmish\u2014the kind of conflict no one<br />\nwants to witness. Fortunately, a decision<br />\nmade at an emergency meeting of the Executuve Committee of the Board of<br />\nTrustees late last night will likely prevent<br />\nthe kind of unsavory confrontation that<br />\noccu red Monday from happening in the<br />\nfuture.<br />\nAccording to the late-breaking decision (which comes on the eve of the<br />\nCoalition's newest scheduled shanty construction project) the Coalition will be<br />\nallowed to build a shanty or shanties on<br />\nthe lower quad provided that the structures meet applicable fire and safety<br />\nregulations and that no one inhabits<br />\nthem.<br />\nWe applaud that decision.<br />\nThe issue which has divided the Coalition and the administration all along can<br />\nbe traced to a conflict between two<br />\nspecific sets of concerns. On the one<br />\nhand, the Coalition has maintained that<br />\nits members have a right to protest the<br />\nUniversity's divestment policy. For the<br />\nCoalition, the physical safety of protesters has always been a secondary<br />\nconcern.<br /><br />\nThe administration, however, has insisted continually that safety must come<br />\nfirst and foremost. According to the administration, matters of safety can<br />\noutweigh freedom of speech concerns.<br />\nBoth sides have made very legitimate<br />\narguments. Strangely enough, both sides<br />\nalso seem to have been in fundamental<br />\nagreement all along concerning the importance of freedom of expression and<br />\nsafety. The only area of difference, until now, has been the priority that should<br />\nbe given to the two sets of concerns.<br />\nWith so much in common, it's surprising that the Coalition and the administration couldn't have reached a cordial settlement on the issue of shanty<br />\nconstruction earlier. All along, the administration simply should have allowed demonstrators to build protest shanties provided the shanties were structurally safe.<br />\nThe Coalition members for their part<br />\nshould have publically committed<br />\nthemselves to paying scrupulous attention to fire and safety laws.<br />\nThis morning, an impending sequel to<br />\nMonday's ignoble events seems to have<br />\nbeen averted. Reason has apparently<br />\ntriumphed over the brute force tactics used earlier this week.<br />\nWe can only hope that the latest decision to permit the construction of safe<br />\nprotest shanties will foreshadow a<br />\nclimate of cooperation between protestors and the University and prevent<br />\nunnecessary and mutually unproductive<br />\nhostilities in the future.<br /><br />\nNineteen eighty-five was the<br />\nyear when South Africa came<br />\nto the forefront of the electronic media's attention, and in<br />\nso doing, it galvanized the will<br />\nof many of our compatriots to<br />\nvoice their objections against<br />\nthe brutally unjust system of<br />\napartheid in South Africa.<br />\nPerhaps spearheading the<br />\nmovement of American antiapartheid activism are the<br />\nstudents of American universities. They more than any<br />\nother group have been able to<br />\nin a rather heavy handed way<br /><br />\ndivestment indignation to the<br />\nuniversity policy. This week's<br />\nunfortunate incident marks the<br />\nfirst time when force has been<br />\nused by the University--a move<br />\nthat can only greaten the rift.<br />\nWe are thus left at a<br />\ncrossroads of sorts, with the<br />\nCoalition fuming, and the<br />\nUniversity looking quite bad<br />\nfrom a political standpoint.<br />\nIt is quite unfortunate that it<br />\nshould come to this, for it is entirely obvious that Hopkins,<br />\nand indeed any university<br />\nshould be politically blind. To<br /><br />\njoseph chen<br />\nforce many universities to<br />\ndivest from companies doing<br />\nbusiness in South Africa.<br />\nThis University's student<br />\nbody is no exception, as a fair<br />\nminority of students and this<br />\nnewspaper have jumped on the<br />\nanti-apartheid bandwagon.<br />\nUnfortunately, the rhetoric<br />\nsurrounding this most important and serious of issues has<br />\nbeen of rather low quality as of<br />\nlate. Both the more leftist<br />\nCoalition for a Free South<br />\nAfrica, and the perhaps more<br />\nmoderate to right of center<br />\ntrustees of the University and<br />\nCollege Republicans have been<br />\noversimplifying the issue to the<br />\npoint of absurdity. Where the<br />\npro-divestment factions seem to<br />\nlack the sense to properly<br />\nevaluate the ramifications of<br />\ndivestment, the status quo affirmers seem to lack the \"milk<br />\nof human kindness.\"<br />\nThe on-campus conflict has<br />\nescalated with last May's<br />\nfirebombing, the subsequent<br />\nshanty banning, and pro-<br /><br />\npreserve the academic freedoms<br />\nthat we all enjoy, the University should not take the actively<br />\npolitical stance that divestment<br />\nwould entail. This is not to say<br />\nthat faculty members and<br />\nstudents should not be allowed<br />\nto express themselves freely in<br />\nthe manner that the Constitution sanctions, and act upon<br />\ntheir convictions. Rather, the<br />\nUniversity as an institution<br />\nwhich shelters a wide variety of<br />\npolitical viewpoints should not<br />\nengage in the politics of endorsing one side or another.<br />\nPolitics is a realm that the<br />\nuniversity was not designed<br />\nfor. By acting politically on<br />\nthis issue, many universities<br />\nhave set a dangerous<br />\nprecedent\u2014one that may<br />\nforfeit the sense of free expression now found on university<br />\ncampuses.

We ask Dave Shade<br />\none question: What is the purpose of a bulletin board? We<br />\nare referring to the SAC's new<br />\nposter policy. Quoting from the<br />\nNews-Letter of September 26,<br />\n\"...the bulletin board near the<br /><br />\nLevering Hall game room is the<br />\nonly [one] on campus to which<br />\nstudents may attach posters for<br />\nprivate use.\"<br />\nAgain we see the attempts of<br />\na petty bourgeoisie few to suppress the free speech of an<br />\nalready stifled student body. Indeed, we see more freedom of<br />\nexpression on Communist<br />\nChina's Wall of Democracy<br />\nthan under this Orwellian<br />\nclimate created by the SAC<br />\nwith fines and threats of<br />\nimprisonment.<br />\nBy far the most important<br />\nuse of the public bulletin boards<br />\nat Hopkins is for individual<br />\ncommunication<br />\nbetween<br />\nstudents. Bulletin boards add to<br />\nthe vitality of a university campus. They are a necessary<br />\nmeans of communication between students. Often a glance<br />\nat a crowded bulletin board can<br />\ninform a student quickly and<br />\neffectively of happenings on<br />\ncampus: sales, events, political<br />\nopinions and general news. At<br />\nworst bulletin boards serve as a<br />\nharmless<br />\nform<br />\nof<br />\nentertainment.<br />\nAnd who has the power of<br />\nlife and death over these<br />\nposters? What criteria differentiates a public from a private<br />\nposter? Who should decide?<br />\nJudge Wapner? Another adhoc committee? Or will his<br />\nEminence Dave Shade himself<br />\ngive the \"thumbs-down\" to<br />\nundesirable posters? The obvious answer is that the individual should decide which<br />\nposters are important and<br />\nwhich are not.<br />\nPrevious SAC policy dictated<br />\nthat no more than one poster<br />\nper event be placed on a<br />\nbulletin board.

The<br />\nproblem then might lie in a lack<br />\nof proper enforcement.<br />\nWith the new poster policy,<br />\nthe SAC is defecating upon the<br />\nFirst Amendment. Will they<br />\nnext remove our rights to a petition of grievances or rights to<br />\nFree assembly? How can we<br />\nconcern ourselves with oppression anywhere eke when we<br />\ncannot uproot the weeds of tyrratty from our own backyards!<br />\nLoren Heilweil<br /><br />\nPostering Policy<br />\nTo the Editor:<br />\nAs a third-term member of<br />\nthe SAC Executive Board and<br />\nSAC Secretary, I wish to correct what SAC Chairman<br />\nDavid Shade announced at the<br />\nStudent Council meeting last<br />\nWednesday as reported by the<br />\nNews-Letter.<br />\nFirst, the members or the<br />\nSAC Executive Board have<br />\nnever proposed to restrict<br />\nposters for private use to one<br />\nbulletin board on campus until<br />\nDavid Shade suggested it during the Student Council<br />\nmeeting. It has always been the<br />\nposition of the Board that<br />\nbulletin boards should be an effective means of communication for both students and student groups. The poster policy<br />\nrepresents an attempt to improve their effectiveness. What<br />\nhas been suggested is that the<br />\nboards be divided with a section<br />\nfor personal advertisements.<br />\nSecond, David Shade announced that the fines for illegal posters would be raised to<br />\n$20 for the first three posters<br />\nand $5 for each additional one.<br />\nWhile the idea was brought up<br />\nat the Board meeting, it was<br />\nnever voted upon or approved.<br />\nThus, the fine for illegal posters<br />\nis still $1 for each illegal poster.<br />\nNow, for the benefit of all<br />\nposterers on campus, the poster<br />\npolicy, as passed by the SAC<br />\nExecutive Board and Student<br />\nCouncil, is as follows:<br />\n1. All posters must be placed on bulletin boards only. Only one poster per board per<br />\nevent is permitted.<br />\n2. Each poster should have a<br />\nclearly marked expiration date.<br />\n3. Posters must be affixed<br />\nwith thumbtacks or tape, not<br />\nstaples.<br />\n4. A fine of one dollar will be<br />\nassessed for each illegal poster.<br />\nThis includes both posters that<br />\nare not on bulletin boards and<br />\nexcessive postering on a bulletin<br />\nboard. The money collected<br />\nwill go into a fund for purchasing new bulletin boards.<br />\nI hope this letter will clear up<br />\nany confusion about the poster<br />\npolicy. Any suggestions for improving the policy is more than<br />\nwelcome by the SAC Executive<br />\nBoard.<br />\nRichard Pan<br />\nSAC Secretary<br /><br />\nSukkahs and Shanties<br /><br />\n5TE.ALTI4 BALANcED<br />\nBUDGET<br /><br />\n5TEALT14 FIGHTER<br /><br />\nTo the Editor:<br />\nAt the GRO/Coalition's<br />\n\"open<br />\ndiscussion\"<br />\non<br />\nSeptember 30, a question was<br />\ndirected to President Muller<br />\nstating \"if the Jews on campus<br />\nhave the right to a Sukkah, why<br />\ndon't we have the right to a<br />\nshanty?\"(A Sukkah is a nonpermanent religious construction, which facilitates the observance of the Jewish Agricultural New Year.)<br />\nThis statement is found to be<br />\ninflammatory and irresponsible. This haphazard comparison between freedom of<br />\nreligion and expression of<br />\npolitical views is invidious. The<br />\nUniversity has continually<br />\ngranted the Jews on campus a<br />\nsite upon which to observe this<br />\nholiday. The threat to our<br />\nreligious practices inherent in<br />\nthe GRO's statement does<br />\nnothing but debase their antiapartheid arguments. A university is a place for both<br />\nreligious practice and intellectual debate. When such irresponsible statements are<br />\nmade, the intellectual foundations of this institution are<br />\nthreatened. Hopefully in the<br />\nfuture the GRI/Coalition will<br />\nshow more consideration to the<br />\nJewish community on campus.<br />\nDave B.

During this<br />\nmix-up, I was able to watch the<br />\nviolent, surreal scene of a man<br />\npounding down the shanty, well<br />\nlit by camera lights. How was<br />\nthis malicious destruction any<br />\ndifferent from the fire bombing<br />\nlast spring? Again, no one<br />\nlooked inside the shanty to be<br />\nsure it was empty and again, it<br />\nwas destroyed because of<br />\npolitical intolerance.<br />\nWhile the five women were<br />\nwaiting in the paddy wagon at<br />\nthe Northern Men's Jail, before<br />\nbeing driven to the Women's<br />\nDetention Center downtown,<br />\nRobert Larkin, the head of<br />\nHopkins' Security said to me,<br />\nin an obviously hostile and<br />\npatronizing tone, that there had<br />\nbeen some great shots of me<br /><br />\n4.1..111<br /><br />\n5TEALT1I( ARMS CoNTRoL<br /><br />\nElN<br />\nizccocs( N4114.

However, we must not<br />\nforget where the real blame lies.<br />\nThe injunction and banning of<br />\nshanties as well as their<br />\nculmination in the arrests and<br />\nlock up of fourteen of us could<br />\nhave all been avoided if President Muller, the Truestees,<br />\nJakie Hall, Chris Columbo and<br />\nthe administration in general<br />\nhad been open to a dialogue<br />\nwith the Coalition. Why did<br />\nMuller refuse to meet with us<br />\nuntil Wednesday morning,<br />\nafter the arrests had already occurred? Why did Dean Columbo come to talk with us through<br />\na window in our jail cell and<br />\nnot previously? Our requests<br />\nfor feedback from the administration have been consistently ignored. Hence, we<br />\nwere forced to act on our own<br />\ncommitment that Hopkins<br />\nmust divest.

Unfortunately<br />\nDavid Gitlitz, this is another<br />\nletter about divestment and<br />\napartheid. First of all, I hope<br />\nthat you read the interview of<br />\nPat Naidoo.<br />\nMr. Gitlitz, some of your<br />\nstatements were shamefully indefensible. How you attempt to<br />\ncompare the action of individuals (the \"slaughter of a<br /><br />\ncompletely innocent white<br />\nfamily\") with that of an entire<br />\nsystem of government is<br />\nbeyond me. Apartheid is a<br />\nsystematic denial of all humanness to an entire group of people based on color of their skin.<br />\nYour position on what you call<br />\n\"quick fix solutions\" shows<br />\nyour lack of understanding of<br />\nan issue you have been aware of<br />\nsince your sophomore year in<br />\nhigh school. For all of you out<br />\nthere who entertain the<br />\npossibility of the present racist<br />\nregime in South Africa<br />\npeacefully allowing the majority of South Africans the basic<br />\nrights of being human, I am<br />\nsorry to say that this will never<br />\nhappen.<br />\nAs Pat Naidoo stated in his<br />\ninterview, the situation is getting worse, not better. You see,<br />\nthe mind set of this racist<br />\nregime is that blacks are subhuman. They believe that it is<br />\ntheir divine destiny to rule over<br />\nthese \"savages.\" What fuels<br />\nthis mind set most is fear. Their<br />\nfear of having to deal with<br />\nblacks as equals will prevent<br />\nthem from ever negotiating to<br />\nrelease blacks from their<br />\nenslavement. Armed to the<br />\nteeth and backed by the most<br />\npowerful economic and<br />\nmilitary power in the world,<br />\nBotha and his people are more<br />\nthan willing to fight it out.<br />\nIt is because of this that<br />\ndivestment<br />\nmust<br />\nbe<br />\nundertaken.<br />\nThe Presbyterian Church of<br />\nthe U.S.A. put it this way: faced with an intractable situation,<br />\ndivestment is the only alternative. It has been shown that\u2022<br />\nincreased U.S. involvement is<br />\nnot the answer, as U.S. investment in South Africa increased<br />\n920 percent from 1960-1985,<br />\nContinued on Page 11<br /><br />\nNEWS-LETTER/11<br /><br />\nLetters<br />\nContinued from Page 10<br />\nand apartheid has only gotten<br />\nstronger. It has also been<br />\nshown that stock-holder resolutions are far from successful in<br />\ngetting U.S. companies to<br />\nwithdraw from South Africa.<br />\n(Because of the limit on space<br />\n1 can not provide you with the<br />\nevidence for this, but if you<br />\ndesire it, feel free to contact me)<br />\nThus, the situation for the investor is two-fold. Either keep<br />\nyour money in a firm that continues to provide vital economic<br />\nsupport to a racist regime, or<br />\nput your money elsewhere. This<br />\nis the dilemma that faces the<br />\nJ.H.U. Board of Trustees. As<br />\nthe Presbyterian Church put it,<br />\ndivestment is the only<br />\nalternative.<br />\nOne final Point: as long as injustices exist, those attempting<br />\nto bring attention to it have yet<br />\nto make their point.<br /><br />\nvestments in slavery, to plan to<br />\nattend the next coalition event.<br />\nBring a friend and show your<br />\nsupport\u2014it is now that you are<br />\nneeded most.

To<br />\nnon-member students, it also<br />\nprovides a social outlet in addition to those offered by other<br />\nUniversity groups.<br />\nAnother important aspect of<br />\nour Greek system is that it<br />\nbenefits various organizations<br />\nin the Baltimore area. Examples of this include: fundraisers and contributions to the<br />\nHeart Fund and Santa Claus<br />\nAnonymous, participation in<br />\nthe Big Brother and Sister Pro-<br /><br />\ngram of Maryland, volunteering at the Chimes School for<br />\nRetarded Children, supporting<br />\nfood drives and blood drives, as<br />\nwell as other philanthropic activities too numerous to<br />\nmention.<br />\nWe encourage the printing of<br />\nthis letter due to the fact that<br />\nmany readers may be unaware<br />\nof the positive effects that<br />\nfraternities/sororities have on<br />\nthe Hopkins community and<br />\nthe Baltimore community at<br />\nlarge.<br />\nIt is high time that something<br />\nother than the negative is<br />\npublicized about our Greek<br />\nsystem, as this is essential to the<br />\nsurvival of the much needed<br />\nHopkins Greek system.<br />\nThe Student Council of The<br />\nJohns Hopkins University passed a resolution formalizing its<br />\nsupport of Greek System and<br /><br />\nthe Inter-Fraternity Council.<br />\nWe hope that the balance of the<br />\nHopkins community and that<br />\nthe city if Baltimore will join in<br />\nthis show of support.<br />\nChristopher Verica<br />\nPres., Class of 1987<br />\nSusan J.

It's a<br />\nneoclassic revivalist mansion-and a fascinating part of<br />\nHopkins.<br />\nIt's the Evergreen House.<br />\nAlthough few Hopkins<br />\nstudents know much about it,<br />\nEvergreen House was bequeathed to the Johns Hopkins<br />\nUniversity in 1942 by John W.<br />\nGarrett. It houses much of the<br />\nEisenhower Library's Rare<br />\nBooks Collection. In addition,<br />\nHopkins hosts seminars, lectures and meetings there. Mrs.<br />\nMeredith Millspaugh, Director<br />\nof Evergreen House, said, \"the<br />\nmansion was intended to be used for purely educational purposes\" and Hopkins likes to<br />\nuse it \"when they want to put<br />\ntheir best foot forward.\"<br />\nGarrett left his mansion to<br />\nthe University with the<br />\nunderstanding that his wife,<br />\nAlice, would live there until her<br />\ndeath. In 1952(the year of her<br />\ndeath), Mrs. Garrett established the Evergreen House Foundation as a research library and<br />\nmuseum.<br />\nThe John Work Garrett Rare<br />\nBooks Library is open to<br />\nHopkins affiliates and anyone<br />\nwho has a scholarly reason for<br />\nusing the books. The library's<br />\ncollection was started by Garrett's father, T. Harrison Gar-<br /><br />\nrett, who was an avid birdwatcher and collector ofhatural<br />\nhistory books. The library itself<br />\nwas added to the mansion in<br />\n1928 and was designed by<br />\nBaltimore architect Laurence<br />\nHall Fowler. Fowler left his collection of architectural books to<br />\nthe library; in addition, it holds<br />\nworks from Chaucer, the four<br />\nShakespeare folios, a collection<br />\nof early Maryland history,<br />\nmany old Bibles, and a wailful<br />\nof Incunabula (books printed<br />\nbefore 1501.) There are about<br />\n7,0(X) books in this beautiful,<br />\nwalnut-paneled room. But<br />\nthere are also priceless pieces of<br />\nfurniture, eighteenth-century<br />\nChinese screens made of jade,<br />\nand other faulous works of art.<br />\nOnly the most fragile of the<br />\nlibrary's collection is kept in<br />\nthis room because it is climate<br />\nand humidity-controlled; the<br />\nhouse itself contains a total of<br />\n20-25,0(X) books.<br />\nIn the hall outside the library<br />\nis an enormous display case in<br />\nwhich there is currently a<br />\ndisplay of books about voyage<br />\nand discovery.

The<br />\nonly sad note was a disappointing 1-0 loss to Franklin and<br />\nMarshall last Thursday.<br />\nThe Lady Jays began their<br />\ncurrent streak of two wins last<br />\nSunday against Juniata. For the<br />\nfirst score, midfielder Laura<br /><br />\nPerlinn passed the ball to forward Jen Kenoian, who dodged<br />\ntwo Juniata players and then<br />\npassed it to a wide open Jackie<br />\nFatula, who aimed it past the<br />\ngoalie and into the cage. Fatula<br />\nalso scored the second goal,<br />\nconnecting on a pass from<br />\ncenter midfielder Kathy Hart.<br />\nThe third goal came on a penalty corner when Jen Kenoian hit<br />\nthe ball out from the endline to<br />\nApril Savoye, who then stopped<br />\nit and slammed it into the right<br /><br />\nhand corner of the goal.<br />\nGoalkeepers Rachel McGuckian<br />\nand Jennie O'Hara shared credit<br />\nfor the shutout.<br />\n\"We are playing so much<br />\nmore aggressively,\" said Coach<br />\nSally Beth Anderson. \"The<br />\nmidfielders Hart, Laura<br />\nPerlinn, Heather Klink and<br />\nAlice Collins are keeping it<br />\nbottled up nicely. It was due to<br />\nthe great playing of the midfielders and defense that we<br />\nwere on the attack so much.\"<br />\nThe hocksters kept up their<br />\nlevel of play against Catholic,<br />\ndefeating them 2-1 in the hot<br />\nand humid weather of Tuesday,<br />\nSeptember 30. Hopkins came<br />\nout roaring and scored on a<br />\npenalty corner in less than five<br />\nminutes. Kenoian hit the ball<br />\nout to Savoye, who stopped it<br />\nand passed it across to Fatula,<br />\nwho drove it into the cage. This<br />\nsame play worked again in the<br />\nsecond half and put the Lady<br />\nJays up 2-0. Unfortunately, the<br />\nshutout was spoiled when a<br />\nCatholic forward slipped the<br />\nball past Hopkins goalkeeper<br />\nO'Hara.<br />\nThe game at Franklin and<br />\nMarshall on September 25 was<br />\na battle between two equal<br />\nteams. Either team could have<br />\nwon, but Hopkins couldn't<br />\nscore and ended up losing 1-0.<br />\nThe winning goal came off a<br />\nlong hit that hit the stick of an<br />\nF&amp;M forward and was deflected<br />\naround goalie McGuckian.

According to Coach<br />\nAnderson, \"We played well at<br />\nF&amp;M.

Varsity halfback Laura<br />\nPerlinn scored from right wing<br />\nto put the Jays up 1-0 midway<br />\nthrough the first half. F&amp;M tied<br />\nit up in the second half, but<br />\nminutes later, freshman Chris<br />\nSullivan, coming off a great<br />\ngame as varsity left halfback,<br /><br />\nscored the winning goal.<br />\nThe varsity's current record<br />\nstands at 3 wins, 4 losses, and 1<br />\ntie. The team has won all their<br />\ngames played at home on the<br />\nturf but has yet to win away on<br />\ngrass. The hocksters continue<br />\ntheir home stand, and hopefully<br />\ntheir winning streak, on Saturday, October 4, when they take<br />\non Mount St. Mary's at 10:30<br />\na.m. This matchup should be exceptionally interesting, as Mount<br />\nSt. Mary's won the regular season game last year 2-1 in double<br />\novertime, while Hopkins came<br />\nback to beat them 2-1 in the<br />\nBaltimore College Championship game in tie-breaking penalty strokes.

Coach<br />\nBill Tierney is very pleased with<br />\nhis charges and points out that<br />\nthis was the first opening league<br />\nwin over Haverford in six<br />\nyears. The game had been a<br />\nscoreless tie until the eleven<br />\nminute mark in the second half<br />\nwhen junior midfielder Steve<br />\nGallo blasted a shot into the<br />\nnets on an assist from fellow<br />\njunior midfielder, Kevin Flynn.<br />\nAn insurance goal was added<br /><br />\nDiego Marodona<br /><br />\nSome action from last Saturday's rout of St. Mary's at Homewood Field.<br /><br />\nby senior forward, Charles<br />\nDigby.
