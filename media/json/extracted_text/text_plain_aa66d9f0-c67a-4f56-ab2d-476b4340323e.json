For this ten dollars the<br />\nstudent will receive not only his<br />\nlocker, but also towels and a season<br />\nticket to Homewood. The Board<br />\nwill submit the proposition with the<br />\nrecommendation that it be adopted.<br />\nThe present fee is five dollars.<br />\nThere are several reasons for this<br />\nchange. In the first place the present fee is very low when compared<br />\nwith those of other colleges of the<br />\nstanding of Johns Hopkins, where<br />\nit is generally fifteen dollars. Secondly, it will enable every student<br />\nto be present at all games which are<br />\nplayed at Homewood, and thereby<br />\ndo much to increase college spirit.<br />\nThirdly, it will make much simpler<br />\nthe collection of money as the locker<br />\nfee, towel service, and season tickets<br />\nare all paid for separately at present.<br />\nBefore the change can go into effect, however, it must be approved<br />\nby the Board of Trustees. The<br />\nAthletic Board feels sure that this<br />\napproval will be given, provided the<br />\nstudents themselves are in favor of<br />\nsuch a step.<br />\nThis action by the athletic authorities is sure to be favorably received, as it has been urged strongly<br />\nby many members of the University<br />\nfor several years. It is a progressive move in the right direction,<br />\nand although some will probably<br />\noppose it, it will most likely be in<br />\noperation next fall.<br />\nRock Hill Game Off.<br />\n<br />\nThe opening game of the University's baseball season\u2014that with<br />\nRock Hill College\u2014was called off<br />\nSaturday because of cold weather<br />\nand the condition of the Rock Hill<br />\ndiamond, which was a patchwork<br />\nof snow and marsh. It has not yet<br />\nbeen decided whether the game will<br />\nbe played later on in the season,<br />\nbut inasmuch as it is a factor in<br />\nthe race for the State championship,<br />\nthere is a strong probability of<br />\nanother date being named.<br />\nThe University will play Princeton Saturday at Princeton, and the<br />\nlacrosse team will open the season<br />\nat Homewood with a picked alumni<br />\nteam for its opponent.<br />\nHopkins and Rock Hill were not<br />\nthe only teams disappointed Saturday, for the Navy-Maryland \"Aggies\" and Georgetown-Mount St.<br />\nJoseph's games were also cancelled.<br />\n<br />\n\f2<br />\n<br />\nTHE NEWS\u2014LETTER, MARCH<br />\n<br />\nNOTICE<br />\n<br />\n.23, 1914.<br />\n<br />\nTEAMS BEGIN OUTDOOR PRACTICE<br />\n<br />\nHOPKINS TO HAVE BIG VISITOR<br />\n<br />\nBaseball and Lacrosse Squads Respond<br />\nto Call of First Fine Days Field<br />\nat Homewood Still Soft.<br />\n<br />\nPresident Landes of University of Washington to Be Here Soon in Search<br />\nof Men for His Faculty.<br />\n<br />\nA\u2022revised alphabetical list of<br />\nadvertisers will be ready by the<br />\nlatter part of the week.

The Association<br />\nhopes in the very near future to<br />\nbe able to establish a central college<br />\nnews bureau to furnish exchanges<br />\nto the constituent members.<br />\nThe New Freshman Rule.<br />\n<br />\nThe suggestion that freshman attendance at the organization meetings of the college's various activities be made compulsory, which<br />\nwas embodied in a letter from \"A<br />\nMuch Interested Alumnus,\" printed<br />\nlast week, has met with the approval of a majority of the students<br />\nand has received the unanimous endorsement of the members of the<br />\nStudent Council.<br />\nBriefly, the suggestion is this:<br />\nFor the purpose of getting every<br />\none of the members of the incoming class interested in the college's<br />\nactivities, and making them feel that<br />\nthey are wanted as candidates for<br />\nthe various athletic teams and as<br />\nmembers of the Musical Clubs and<br />\nthe Literary Society\u2014providing, of<br />\ncourse, that they have the neces-.<br />\nsary talents\u2014it is proposed that a<br />\nrule be inserted in the \"Code of<br />\nFreshman Regulations\" providing<br />\ncompulsory freshman attendance at<br />\nthe organization meetings.<br />\n<br />\nThere is significance in the rapidity<br />\nwith which articles on the colleges arc<br />\nappearing in the public press; evidently<br />\ncolleges are growing in some sort of<br />\nreputation and are receiving notice accordingly. The latest discussion is in<br />\nthe current Outlook and is a substantiated opinion that colleges are giving<br />\nvaluable business training. This is<br />\nscarcely in accord with Mr. Bok, who<br />\nstated in the same magazine last summer<br />\nthat good business men avoid col:ege<br />\ngraduates until they have had time to<br />\nhave foolish ideals and ideas knocked<br />\nfrom their heads.. And this article does<br />\nnot blame the college for the fools<br />\nthat sometimes graduate from it. Mr.<br />\nDraper, the author of the recent article,<br />\nhas taken the trouble to get actual facts<br />\nfrom a number of prominent industrial<br />\nexecutives. This is more than most<br />\ncritics of the college have done, and the<br />\nresult is that his conclusions differ from<br />\nmost of theirs. He says that \"the consensus of opinion and the weight of evidence show that, as a rule, the college<br />\nman goes the non-college man one<br />\nbetter.\"<br />\nThat is the conclusion. What are the<br />\nreasons? In the first place, Mr. Draper<br />\nbelieves that no man can lead a business<br />\nwithout clear and \"workable\" ideas; and<br />\nthat \"the harnessing of the imagination\"<br />\ncan best be learned in college, for in<br />\ncollege \"he who knows, but cannot express what he knows, is no better off<br />\nthan as if he did not know at all.\" In<br />\nthe second place, \"college life is a life<br />\namong ideals,\" and business is fast learning that it is not \"alone a game of outwitting and profiting,\" but of \"benefiting<br />\nthe community\" and individual, \"morally,<br />\nas well as materially.\"<br />\nYet, Mr. Draper is not all praise. He<br />\nsays that we cannot get away from the<br />\nfact that college men are apt to be extravagant, careless and lacking in application. Fortunately, these generally<br />\nprove to be superficial traits, soon overcome, but they indicate the course which<br />\ncollege men should pursue in their reforms. We know from experience that<br />\ncarelessness, at least, is a college failing.<br />\nReading of \"Enoch Arden.\"<br />\n<br />\nThe reading of Tennyson's \"Enoch<br />\nArden\" to Strauss's musical setting,<br />\nwhich was given last Friday evening in McCoy Hall by Mr. Herbert<br />\nBard, assisted by Mr. Thomas<br />\nMoss, pianist, of the Tome School<br />\nfor Boys, afforded a most delightful evening's entertainment for the<br />\nlarge number of people present.<br />\nMr. Bard's reading of the poem<br />\nwas most pleasing; he was easily<br />\nheard and understood throughout<br />\nthe hall, and his interpretation of<br />\nthe characters was intensely fascinating in its reality of impression<br />\n<br />\n;7.<br />\n<br />\n\u2022;.<br />\n<br />\nmittnintin<br />\n<br />\nWYMAN<br />\n<br />\nLEFRANC & AULT<br />\n<br />\nCOLLEGE SHOES<br />\nFOR<br />\nCOLLEGE MEN<br />\nThey look well-- fit well\u2014wear well.<br />\nWe guarantee satisfaction.<br />\nThe YALE<br />\n$4.00<br />\nThe PRINCETON<br />\n4.50<br />\nThe ENGLISH<br />\n5.00<br />\nThe MARYLAND (broad toe) 5.00<br />\n<br />\nWYMAN, 19 Lexington St.<br />\n,Daltimore's Largest Shoe Store<br />\n<br />\nARE SHOWING<br />\n<br />\nNEW NECKWEAR<br />\nAND NEW SHIRTS<br />\nAT THE<br />\n<br />\n\"SHIRT SHOP\"<br />\n421 N.

For this ten dollars the<br />\nstudent will receive not only his<br />\nlocker, but also towels and a season<br />\nticket to Homewood. The Board<br />\nwill submit the proposition with the<br />\nrecommendation that it be adopted.<br />\nThe present fee is five dollars.<br />\nThere are several reasons for this<br />\nchange. In the first place the present fee is very low when compared<br />\nwith those of other colleges of the<br />\nstanding of Johns Hopkins, where<br />\nit is generally fifteen dollars. Secondly, it will enable every student<br />\nto be present at all games which are<br />\nplayed at Homewood, and thereby<br />\ndo much to increase college spirit.<br />\nThirdly, it will make much simpler<br />\nthe collection of money as the locker<br />\nfee, towel service, and season tickets<br />\nare all paid for separately at present.<br />\nBefore the change can go into effect, however, it must be approved<br />\nby the Board of Trustees. The<br />\nAthletic Board feels sure that this<br />\napproval will be given, provided the<br />\nstudents themselves are in favor of<br />\nsuch a step.<br />\nThis action by the athletic authorities is sure to be favorably received, as it has been urged strongly<br />\nby many members of the University<br />\nfor several years. It is a progressive move in the right direction,<br />\nand although some will probably<br />\noppose it, it will most likely be in<br />\noperation next fall.<br />\nRock Hill Game Off.<br /><br />\nThe opening game of the University's baseball season\u2014that with<br />\nRock Hill College\u2014was called off<br />\nSaturday because of cold weather<br />\nand the condition of the Rock Hill<br />\ndiamond, which was a patchwork<br />\nof snow and marsh. It has not yet<br />\nbeen decided whether the game will<br />\nbe played later on in the season,<br />\nbut inasmuch as it is a factor in<br />\nthe race for the State championship,<br />\nthere is a strong probability of<br />\nanother date being named.<br />\nThe University will play Princeton Saturday at Princeton, and the<br />\nlacrosse team will open the season<br />\nat Homewood with a picked alumni<br />\nteam for its opponent.<br />\nHopkins and Rock Hill were not<br />\nthe only teams disappointed Saturday, for the Navy-Maryland \"Aggies\" and Georgetown-Mount St.<br />\nJoseph's games were also cancelled.<br /><br />\n2<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS\u2014LETTER, MARCH<br /><br />\nNOTICE<br /><br />\n.23, 1914.<br /><br />\nTEAMS BEGIN OUTDOOR PRACTICE<br /><br />\nHOPKINS TO HAVE BIG VISITOR<br /><br />\nBaseball and Lacrosse Squads Respond<br />\nto Call of First Fine Days Field<br />\nat Homewood Still Soft.<br /><br />\nPresident Landes of University of Washington to Be Here Soon in Search<br />\nof Men for His Faculty.<br /><br />\nA\u2022revised alphabetical list of<br />\nadvertisers will be ready by the<br />\nlatter part of the week.

The Association<br />\nhopes in the very near future to<br />\nbe able to establish a central college<br />\nnews bureau to furnish exchanges<br />\nto the constituent members.<br />\nThe New Freshman Rule.<br /><br />\nThe suggestion that freshman attendance at the organization meetings of the college's various activities be made compulsory, which<br />\nwas embodied in a letter from \"A<br />\nMuch Interested Alumnus,\" printed<br />\nlast week, has met with the approval of a majority of the students<br />\nand has received the unanimous endorsement of the members of the<br />\nStudent Council.<br />\nBriefly, the suggestion is this:<br />\nFor the purpose of getting every<br />\none of the members of the incoming class interested in the college's<br />\nactivities, and making them feel that<br />\nthey are wanted as candidates for<br />\nthe various athletic teams and as<br />\nmembers of the Musical Clubs and<br />\nthe Literary Society\u2014providing, of<br />\ncourse, that they have the neces-.<br />\nsary talents\u2014it is proposed that a<br />\nrule be inserted in the \"Code of<br />\nFreshman Regulations\" providing<br />\ncompulsory freshman attendance at<br />\nthe organization meetings.<br /><br />\nThere is significance in the rapidity<br />\nwith which articles on the colleges arc<br />\nappearing in the public press; evidently<br />\ncolleges are growing in some sort of<br />\nreputation and are receiving notice accordingly. The latest discussion is in<br />\nthe current Outlook and is a substantiated opinion that colleges are giving<br />\nvaluable business training. This is<br />\nscarcely in accord with Mr. Bok, who<br />\nstated in the same magazine last summer<br />\nthat good business men avoid col:ege<br />\ngraduates until they have had time to<br />\nhave foolish ideals and ideas knocked<br />\nfrom their heads.. And this article does<br />\nnot blame the college for the fools<br />\nthat sometimes graduate from it. Mr.<br />\nDraper, the author of the recent article,<br />\nhas taken the trouble to get actual facts<br />\nfrom a number of prominent industrial<br />\nexecutives. This is more than most<br />\ncritics of the college have done, and the<br />\nresult is that his conclusions differ from<br />\nmost of theirs. He says that \"the consensus of opinion and the weight of evidence show that, as a rule, the college<br />\nman goes the non-college man one<br />\nbetter.\"<br />\nThat is the conclusion. What are the<br />\nreasons? In the first place, Mr. Draper<br />\nbelieves that no man can lead a business<br />\nwithout clear and \"workable\" ideas; and<br />\nthat \"the harnessing of the imagination\"<br />\ncan best be learned in college, for in<br />\ncollege \"he who knows, but cannot express what he knows, is no better off<br />\nthan as if he did not know at all.\" In<br />\nthe second place, \"college life is a life<br />\namong ideals,\" and business is fast learning that it is not \"alone a game of outwitting and profiting,\" but of \"benefiting<br />\nthe community\" and individual, \"morally,<br />\nas well as materially.\"<br />\nYet, Mr. Draper is not all praise. He<br />\nsays that we cannot get away from the<br />\nfact that college men are apt to be extravagant, careless and lacking in application. Fortunately, these generally<br />\nprove to be superficial traits, soon overcome, but they indicate the course which<br />\ncollege men should pursue in their reforms. We know from experience that<br />\ncarelessness, at least, is a college failing.<br />\nReading of \"Enoch Arden.\"<br /><br />\nThe reading of Tennyson's \"Enoch<br />\nArden\" to Strauss's musical setting,<br />\nwhich was given last Friday evening in McCoy Hall by Mr. Herbert<br />\nBard, assisted by Mr. Thomas<br />\nMoss, pianist, of the Tome School<br />\nfor Boys, afforded a most delightful evening's entertainment for the<br />\nlarge number of people present.<br />\nMr. Bard's reading of the poem<br />\nwas most pleasing; he was easily<br />\nheard and understood throughout<br />\nthe hall, and his interpretation of<br />\nthe characters was intensely fascinating in its reality of impression<br /><br />\n;7.<br /><br />\n\u2022;.<br /><br />\nmittnintin<br /><br />\nWYMAN<br /><br />\nLEFRANC &amp; AULT<br /><br />\nCOLLEGE SHOES<br />\nFOR<br />\nCOLLEGE MEN<br />\nThey look well-- fit well\u2014wear well.<br />\nWe guarantee satisfaction.<br />\nThe YALE<br />\n$4.00<br />\nThe PRINCETON<br />\n4.50<br />\nThe ENGLISH<br />\n5.00<br />\nThe MARYLAND (broad toe) 5.00<br /><br />\nWYMAN, 19 Lexington St.<br />\n,Daltimore's Largest Shoe Store<br /><br />\nARE SHOWING<br /><br />\nNEW NECKWEAR<br />\nAND NEW SHIRTS<br />\nAT THE<br /><br />\n\"SHIRT SHOP\"<br />\n421 N.

It is highly desirable<br />\nto have all students attend each organization meeting, and by compelling, by the means suggested, the<br />\nfreshman to attend such meetings,<br />\nmay inspire in him a permanent interest in student and University activities. If that end is accomplished,<br />\nthen the suggestion is good.<br />\n\"As for the suggestion relative<br />\nto fussing, I am not in favor of it.<br />\nI believe in a manly, University<br />\nregulation of freshmen, and not in<br />\na boyish high school form of regulation.\" Hiram W.
