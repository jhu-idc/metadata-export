Dr. Muller's refreshing candor<br />\ndominated his inaugural message which showed his deep<br />\ninsight into the University. He rightly steered us back to<br />\nthe road of daring so necessary for greatness, and it is<br />\nnoteworthy that the first problem that he asked the<br />\ncommunity to tackle was undergraduate education. But<br />\nDr. Muller seemed to back off when he defended the<br />\ntraditional role of the University as a socially inactive<br />\ninstitution.

The agencies<br />\nadvertising in the Hopkins<br />\nNews-Letter and other college or<br />\nhip papers in this area have been<br />\ntested by Planned Parenthood<br />\nstaffers. Although the degree of<br />\nsensitivity in the voice at the end<br />\nof the line did vary, the basic<br />\n'message stated by each agency<br />\nwas \"send us the money, and<br />\nwe'll tell you where you can go<br />\nfor an abortion.\" Little<br />\nattention, if any, was paid to the<br />\nuncertainty that the tester<br />\nexpressed about having an<br />\nabortion, or in fact, whether or<br />\nnot she was even pregnant. And<br />\nwith the exception of one case,<br />\nwhen the agency was told that<br />\nthe caller did not have any<br />\nmoney and was literally begging<br />\nfor another resource that would<br />\ndo the abortion for a lower price,<br />\nthe caller was told that she would<br />\nhave to get the money or get no<br />\nabortion.<br />\nAnd the.money: the fees were<br />\nanywhere from $25 to $100<br />\nhigher than the going rates at<br />\nhospitals and free standing<br />\nclinics. In addition to this,<br />\nmisinformation was very<br />\ncommon.
