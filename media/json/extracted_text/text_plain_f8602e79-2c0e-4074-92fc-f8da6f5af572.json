Bates' incompetence and leadership problems are<br />\nnot significantly different from the rest of the SC<br />\nmembers. The removal of Bates is unlikely, since he said<br />\nafter the meeting that he does not plan to resign. So<br />\nsingling out Gerry Bates for a scolding from eight other<br />\nCouncil members is a useless exercise that can only deepen<br />\nthe personality feuds that have hampered the Council this<br />\nyear. Everyone in the Council, including Bates, should try<br />\nto tighten the bonds between them and the students they<br />\nare supposed to represent, as well as move forward<br />\neffectively on gaining policy-making power for Bates.<br />\nBates, though, has failed in a number of key leadership<br />\nareas. He has not provided vigorous enough leadership and<br />\ndirection to a badly-split Council. At the same time, he has<br />\nbeen ignoring democratic methods with such acts as<br />\npushing through a replacement for former Vice-President<br />\nEsta Baker without consulting either the student body or<br />\nthe Council itself. But the opposition that surfaced<br />\nofficially last evening might prove to be a beneficial<br />\neducation for Bates\u2014otherwise, he indeed should resign.<br />\n<br />\nActivities funds<br />\nThe financial difficulties which face campus activities,<br />\nthreatened with the failure of a proposed fee hike and the<br />\nending of administration funding, has prompted Student<br />\nActivities Commission Chairman Dick Heddleson to seek a<br />\ncomfortable resting place within the University budget.<br />\nAlthough he plans to keep the student activities fee for<br />\nthis year as \"something we can fall back on\" if not<br />\nsatisfied with administration funding, he implied that the<br />\nactivities fee might be ended as soon as next year. The<br />\nresult for both smaller organizations and larger groups<br />\ncould be dangerous. All campus activities would be subject<br />\nto University fiscal review, a threatening situation ripe for<br />\npotential abuse of the administration's budgetary power.<br />\nThis year, the administration might very well provide<br />\nadequate funding for student groups without cracking<br />\ndown on those critical of University policies. But this<br />\ncould prove merely a ruse to convince the SAC to end the<br />\nactivities fee\u2014and once ended, the fee is not easily<br />\nreinstated.

A lot of people tell the<br />\nthumbies that they only picked them up<br />\nbecause they look like their son. \"I<br />\ndon't usually pick up hitchhikers, but<br />\nmy son looks like you and since he went<br />\nto college, he's been hitching, and I just<br />\nwouldn't feel right passing you by,\"<br />\nthey say.<br />\nOf course, these people make up a<br />\nrather small fraction of the hitchhiker's<br />\nbenefactors. Most of the time, the<br />\npeople who pick up hitchers, fall into<br />\nthree main groups. There are the<br />\ngreasers, the rednecks and the freaks.<br />\nGreasers<br />\nThe greasers usually drive Mustangs<br />\nwith huge engines, double overhead<br />\ncams, hood scoops and dice dangling<br />\nfrom the rear view mirror. After looking<br />\n<br />\nI. TH0U61-11 POI,IT(C5<br />\n1.0166 THE Ik/J51,0ER<br />\n<br />\nat the sign, standard equipment for all<br />\nhitchers, they ask, \"Where are you<br />\nheaded,\" just giving one the odd<br />\nimpression that greasers can't read.<br />\nDuring the drive, the patented greaser<br />\nstrategy is to look bored. Therefore,<br />\nthey don't talk.<br />\nNot Alone<br />\nBut the greaser is not alone in his<br />\nsilence. For many of the people who<br />\npick up hitchers do it to feel superior to<br />\nsomeone, as if to say, \"You're<br />\ndependent on my charity, so therefore,<br />\nI must be better than you.\"<br />\nOften, the rednecks who pick up<br />\nhitchhikers do it only to tell them how<br />\nmuch they hate long-hairs and kids. And<br />\nthey will talk about their own sons.<br />\n\"My son, he's so dumb. He's stupid as<br />\nshit.\" Which makes one wonder why he<br />\npicks up kids in the 'first place.<br />\n<br />\nBy FOCAL<br />\nIt's never been easy.<br />\nAnd it's getting harder. Hitchhiking<br />\ndepends on motorists being both willing<br />\nand able to pick up strangers. Modern<br />\ntimes: more speed, more paranoia (!),<br />\nmore arrests both for hitching and for<br />\nstopping.<br />\nStill, the thumbing art persists, with<br />\nvariations. The walking school of<br />\nhitching has been reborn, after years,<br />\ngolden everything's-freaky years, of<br />\nthirty-second standing waits and<br />\n\"why-don't-I-take-you-there\" rides.<br />\nPerhaps we only imagined them.<br />\nFor every loss, though, there is some<br />\nconcomitant gain. The<br />\nBaltimore-Washington ride that in the<br />\npast was quicker than the train now<br />\ntakes an hour and thirty minutes\u2014but<br />\nmore often than not sacramental smoke<br />\n<br />\n... ten miles behind<br />\n<br />\nFlashes on the New Jersey Turnpike:<br />\nfriends busted, friends framed, friends<br />\nbrutalized. Some that make you smile.<br />\nCalifornia perversity; The Man sees a<br />\nfreak, a friend, picked up. Sirens and<br />\nlights, slowly to the side, for there are<br />\nfour ounces of Rhode Apple Red in the<br />\ncar; frenetic activity. Fatcat uniform,<br />\nsuperdry smile: \"Made you eat it, didn't<br />\nI?\" Zap.<br />\nAnd I Say<br />\nBack on the pavement. That feel of<br />\nsolid ground makes every ride a dream.<br />\nWashington to New York is long enough<br />\nto blur the first three into one; there is<br />\n:no reality in sitting down and moving<br />\nanyway. Time divides itself into<br />\nintervals marked by the closing of car<br />\ndoors, and frequently gets out of hand<br />\nentirely. Nothing brings it back so well<br />\nas danger.<br />\nThe first ride ever with a really<br />\ndrunken fool tests your mettle as a<br />\nthumber. When is it time to jump? Eyes<br />\nclosed or open? And a kiss for the earth<br />\nwhen it's over. Back on the shoulder;<br />\nmore reality.<br />\n<br />\nme and ten<br />\n<br />\nHello<br />\n<br />\nthousand more to go ..<br />\nBut the rednecks are frequently<br />\ngenerous. As if there is some mystical<br />\nceremony of the road, known only to<br />\ntruckers and hitchhikers, they always<br />\noffer cigarettes. They seem to be<br />\nfulfilled if the hitcher takes a cigarette,<br />\nas if they really do have something to<br />\noffer. The brand they palm is inevitably<br />\nCamels or Luckies. And the redneck<br />\nacts disappointed if the new passenger<br />\nsays he doesn't smoke.<br />\nFreaks<br />\nIn the end, the most likely candidates<br />\nto pick up hitchhikers are freaks. Often<br />\ndriving old beatup cars, such as<br />\nStudebakers and Nashes, they always<br />\nstop.\"Hey man, how're you doing?\"<br />\n\"Okay.\"<br />\n\"Where you going? ... I'll take you up<br />\nto the Mass Pike...You won't have any<br />\ntrouble hitching from there. Hitching's<br />\nreally good up there.\"<br />\n\"Yeah, it's good in a lot of places.\"<br />\n<br />\nE3UT<br />\n<br />\n1-1 FAII,EP<br />\n<br />\n\u2022<br />\n<br />\nclouds the windshield.

Mother always<br />\nsaid not to take rides from strangers.<br />\nTime, and time again, the obvious is<br />\nemphasized: to get over the next hill, to<br />\nthe next town, the next state, the body<br />\nmust be moved. Concentrate, eyes<br />\nclosed,will as hard as possible...still the<br />\nbody must be moved.<br />\nIt's never been easy.<br />\nGoodbye<br />\nThere is a continuing competition<br />\nover the \"Strangest Trip\" award. Top<br />\nthis: left by a feuding Arizona couple,<br />\nnameless, ninety miles out of Phoenix,<br />\nwith their car, their baby, a head full of<br />\nacid, and instructions to leave the car<br />\nanywhere in San Diego. The current<br />\nchampion.<br />\n<br />\nMost amazing of all is the fact that<br />\nhitchhiking works. It is, after all,<br />\npossible to move the body without<br />\nhiring someone to do it for you. There<br />\nis always a ride\u2014eventually. Even after<br />\nthree frozen-ass hours in Wilkes-Bane,<br />\nPennsylvania, there is a ride. Perhaps an<br />\nup-country sales manager, Jack Daniels<br />\nhis co-pilot and heating system, driving<br />\na route as large and desolate as the<br />\nMojave; perhaps a farmer whose son<br />\nhitches back and forth between<br />\nRenssalaer and Upper Darby, who will<br />\ntalk to you of cattle and the Movement,<br />\nand smile as he leaves Route 83 and his<br />\npassenger.<br />\nBack on the road.

Bates' incompetence and leadership problems are<br />\nnot significantly different from the rest of the SC<br />\nmembers. The removal of Bates is unlikely, since he said<br />\nafter the meeting that he does not plan to resign. So<br />\nsingling out Gerry Bates for a scolding from eight other<br />\nCouncil members is a useless exercise that can only deepen<br />\nthe personality feuds that have hampered the Council this<br />\nyear. Everyone in the Council, including Bates, should try<br />\nto tighten the bonds between them and the students they<br />\nare supposed to represent, as well as move forward<br />\neffectively on gaining policy-making power for Bates.<br />\nBates, though, has failed in a number of key leadership<br />\nareas. He has not provided vigorous enough leadership and<br />\ndirection to a badly-split Council. At the same time, he has<br />\nbeen ignoring democratic methods with such acts as<br />\npushing through a replacement for former Vice-President<br />\nEsta Baker without consulting either the student body or<br />\nthe Council itself. But the opposition that surfaced<br />\nofficially last evening might prove to be a beneficial<br />\neducation for Bates\u2014otherwise, he indeed should resign.<br /><br />\nActivities funds<br />\nThe financial difficulties which face campus activities,<br />\nthreatened with the failure of a proposed fee hike and the<br />\nending of administration funding, has prompted Student<br />\nActivities Commission Chairman Dick Heddleson to seek a<br />\ncomfortable resting place within the University budget.<br />\nAlthough he plans to keep the student activities fee for<br />\nthis year as \"something we can fall back on\" if not<br />\nsatisfied with administration funding, he implied that the<br />\nactivities fee might be ended as soon as next year. The<br />\nresult for both smaller organizations and larger groups<br />\ncould be dangerous. All campus activities would be subject<br />\nto University fiscal review, a threatening situation ripe for<br />\npotential abuse of the administration's budgetary power.<br />\nThis year, the administration might very well provide<br />\nadequate funding for student groups without cracking<br />\ndown on those critical of University policies. But this<br />\ncould prove merely a ruse to convince the SAC to end the<br />\nactivities fee\u2014and once ended, the fee is not easily<br />\nreinstated.

I also presume, with the<br />\nsame cause, that my opinions,<br />\nlike Dr. Shaffer's own, are<br />\ndeserving of more attention than<br />\nthose of the less gifted sex who<br />\nmight complain of the<br />\ninhumanity which refuses to give<br />\near to long-formulated criticisms<br />\nof social structure and<br />\nexpressions of desires not<br />\nallowed to be fulfilled; nor, I<br />\nhope, can these opinions be<br />\nattributed to menstrual or<br />\nmenopausal frenzy.<br />\nIn my experience as an<br />\nundergradu.ate at a<br />\nco-educational college, and as a<br />\ngraduate student here, my<br />\ncontact with women colleagues<br />\nand teachers (though of the<br />\nlatter there were remarkably<br />\nfew, and none, I would guess,<br />\nwas physiologically<br />\nunexceptionable) was invaluable<br />\nto my education for a<br />\ndistinguished career. In addition,<br />\nmy extra-academic contact with<br />\nwomen who might be called<br />\nprofessional if their salaries did<br />\nnot deprive the title of any<br />\nsignificance, has led me to wish<br />\nfor nothing more than an<br />\nincrease in their numbers; for<br />\nthey have at the least been<br />\ninstrumental in helping and<br />\nencouraging me onward in the<br />\ncareer for which I was<br />\npredestined by my maker (my<br />\nfather, of course).<br />\nKenny Marotta<br />\nFULL PROFS<br />\nTo The Editors:<br />\nIn an article by M.

This campaign is deadly<br />\nserious and of the utmost importance. At a time<br />\nwhen the capitalist world economy teeters and<br />\nstaggers towards world disaster the comfortable<br />\npundits of Academia carry on business as usual,<br />\ndisplaying with less than regal assuredness that<br />\nwhat they have to say corresponds in no way to<br />\nreality. The crass and vulgar disdain that college<br />\nteachers of economics show to the problems of<br />\nreal economies is demonstrated daily by their<br />\navoidance of debates with NCLC members over<br />\nwhat is really happening in the world we live in.<br />\nStudent pressure, however, is undermining the<br />\nimperviousness of these mandarins. Students will<br />\nno longer listen to nonsense about<br />\n\"depression-free\" economomies and \"built-in<br />\nstabilizers\" when these crackpot ideas are belied<br />\nby such authorities as their daily newspapers.<br />\nAlready Samuelson, Keynes, Galbraith inc., are<br />\nbeing treated with the quaint curiousity one<br />\nreserves for alchemical recipes and medieval herb.<br />\nDr. Stephen Pepper, Art History, submitted<br />\nr//'f 1\"-`<br /><br />\ncures. \"Just rub one GNP twice daily over the<br />\nrising unemployment rate and it will go away.\"<br />\nTake these men up.

In some<br />\nplaces, it is dangerous. In all places, it is<br />\nthe cheapest, as well as the most<br />\neducation al way of getting from one<br />\nplace to another. And sometimes, it<br />\nprovides an opportunity to meet people<br />\none would never expect to meet.<br />\nIt is called hitchhiking. Illegal on<br />\nmost of the major highways in the<br />\nUnited States, it is still one of the<br />\nnation's most popular outdoor sports.<br />\nIt's also nice if one likes to think he<br />\nknows the way to rip off TWA or the<br />\nGreyhound bus company. But there is more to it than that. For<br />\nif the hitcher chooses to think about<br />\nanything more than where the next ride<br />\nis coming from, he will be amazed at the<br />\nfact that he is idealistic enough to<br />\ndepend on the charity of Americans to<br />\nget him from one place to another.<br />\nAmerica's Charity<br />\nMost of the time, America's charity<br />\nwill indeed get him from here to there,<br />\nbut there can be some long and lonely<br />\nwaits for the next ride.<br />\nAnd when it comes, a paradox often<br />\naccompanies it. For the driver of the<br />\ncar, if he is a middle-aged, affluent sort,<br />\nwill often say, \"I don't usually pick up<br />\nhitchhikers, but I couldn't resist your<br />\nsign for Boston.\" One wonders why<br />\nanyone feels apologetic about being<br />\ncharitable.<br />\nOften, the hitchhiker will discover<br />\nthat there are a lot of loney people<br />\ndriving around. Salesmen, driving the<br />\nfour hours from Baltimore to New<br />\nYork, sometimes find irresistible the<br />\nchance for a little company on the<br />\nboring drive. A lot of people tell the<br />\nthumbies that they only picked them up<br />\nbecause they look like their son. \"I<br />\ndon't usually pick up hitchhikers, but<br />\nmy son looks like you and since he went<br />\nto college, he's been hitching, and I just<br />\nwouldn't feel right passing you by,\"<br />\nthey say.<br />\nOf course, these people make up a<br />\nrather small fraction of the hitchhiker's<br />\nbenefactors. Most of the time, the<br />\npeople who pick up hitchers, fall into<br />\nthree main groups. There are the<br />\ngreasers, the rednecks and the freaks.<br />\nGreasers<br />\nThe greasers usually drive Mustangs<br />\nwith huge engines, double overhead<br />\ncams, hood scoops and dice dangling<br />\nfrom the rear view mirror. After looking<br /><br />\nI. TH0U61-11 POI,IT(C5<br />\n1.0166 THE Ik/J51,0ER<br /><br />\nat the sign, standard equipment for all<br />\nhitchers, they ask, \"Where are you<br />\nheaded,\" just giving one the odd<br />\nimpression that greasers can't read.<br />\nDuring the drive, the patented greaser<br />\nstrategy is to look bored. Therefore,<br />\nthey don't talk.<br />\nNot Alone<br />\nBut the greaser is not alone in his<br />\nsilence. For many of the people who<br />\npick up hitchers do it to feel superior to<br />\nsomeone, as if to say, \"You're<br />\ndependent on my charity, so therefore,<br />\nI must be better than you.\"<br />\nOften, the rednecks who pick up<br />\nhitchhikers do it only to tell them how<br />\nmuch they hate long-hairs and kids. And<br />\nthey will talk about their own sons.<br />\n\"My son, he's so dumb. He's stupid as<br />\nshit.\" Which makes one wonder why he<br />\npicks up kids in the 'first place.<br /><br />\nBy FOCAL<br />\nIt's never been easy.<br />\nAnd it's getting harder. Hitchhiking<br />\ndepends on motorists being both willing<br />\nand able to pick up strangers. Modern<br />\ntimes: more speed, more paranoia (!),<br />\nmore arrests both for hitching and for<br />\nstopping.<br />\nStill, the thumbing art persists, with<br />\nvariations. The walking school of<br />\nhitching has been reborn, after years,<br />\ngolden everything's-freaky years, of<br />\nthirty-second standing waits and<br />\n\"why-don't-I-take-you-there\" rides.<br />\nPerhaps we only imagined them.<br />\nFor every loss, though, there is some<br />\nconcomitant gain. The<br />\nBaltimore-Washington ride that in the<br />\npast was quicker than the train now<br />\ntakes an hour and thirty minutes\u2014but<br />\nmore often than not sacramental smoke<br /><br />\n... ten miles behind<br /><br />\nFlashes on the New Jersey Turnpike:<br />\nfriends busted, friends framed, friends<br />\nbrutalized. Some that make you smile.<br />\nCalifornia perversity; The Man sees a<br />\nfreak, a friend, picked up. Sirens and<br />\nlights, slowly to the side, for there are<br />\nfour ounces of Rhode Apple Red in the<br />\ncar; frenetic activity. Fatcat uniform,<br />\nsuperdry smile: \"Made you eat it, didn't<br />\nI?\" Zap.<br />\nAnd I Say<br />\nBack on the pavement. That feel of<br />\nsolid ground makes every ride a dream.<br />\nWashington to New York is long enough<br />\nto blur the first three into one; there is<br />\n:no reality in sitting down and moving<br />\nanyway. Time divides itself into<br />\nintervals marked by the closing of car<br />\ndoors, and frequently gets out of hand<br />\nentirely. Nothing brings it back so well<br />\nas danger.<br />\nThe first ride ever with a really<br />\ndrunken fool tests your mettle as a<br />\nthumber. When is it time to jump? Eyes<br />\nclosed or open? And a kiss for the earth<br />\nwhen it's over. Back on the shoulder;<br />\nmore reality.<br /><br />\nme and ten<br /><br />\nHello<br /><br />\nthousand more to go ..<br />\nBut the rednecks are frequently<br />\ngenerous. As if there is some mystical<br />\nceremony of the road, known only to<br />\ntruckers and hitchhikers, they always<br />\noffer cigarettes. They seem to be<br />\nfulfilled if the hitcher takes a cigarette,<br />\nas if they really do have something to<br />\noffer. The brand they palm is inevitably<br />\nCamels or Luckies. And the redneck<br />\nacts disappointed if the new passenger<br />\nsays he doesn't smoke.<br />\nFreaks<br />\nIn the end, the most likely candidates<br />\nto pick up hitchhikers are freaks. Often<br />\ndriving old beatup cars, such as<br />\nStudebakers and Nashes, they always<br />\nstop.\"Hey man, how're you doing?\"<br />\n\"Okay.\"<br />\n\"Where you going? ... I'll take you up<br />\nto the Mass Pike...You won't have any<br />\ntrouble hitching from there. Hitching's<br />\nreally good up there.\"<br />\n\"Yeah, it's good in a lot of places.\"<br /><br />\nE3UT<br /><br />\n1-1 FAII,EP<br /><br />\n\u2022<br /><br />\nclouds the windshield.

Mother always<br />\nsaid not to take rides from strangers.<br />\nTime, and time again, the obvious is<br />\nemphasized: to get over the next hill, to<br />\nthe next town, the next state, the body<br />\nmust be moved. Concentrate, eyes<br />\nclosed,will as hard as possible...still the<br />\nbody must be moved.<br />\nIt's never been easy.<br />\nGoodbye<br />\nThere is a continuing competition<br />\nover the \"Strangest Trip\" award. Top<br />\nthis: left by a feuding Arizona couple,<br />\nnameless, ninety miles out of Phoenix,<br />\nwith their car, their baby, a head full of<br />\nacid, and instructions to leave the car<br />\nanywhere in San Diego. The current<br />\nchampion.<br /><br />\nMost amazing of all is the fact that<br />\nhitchhiking works. It is, after all,<br />\npossible to move the body without<br />\nhiring someone to do it for you. There<br />\nis always a ride\u2014eventually. Even after<br />\nthree frozen-ass hours in Wilkes-Bane,<br />\nPennsylvania, there is a ride. Perhaps an<br />\nup-country sales manager, Jack Daniels<br />\nhis co-pilot and heating system, driving<br />\na route as large and desolate as the<br />\nMojave; perhaps a farmer whose son<br />\nhitches back and forth between<br />\nRenssalaer and Upper Darby, who will<br />\ntalk to you of cattle and the Movement,<br />\nand smile as he leaves Route 83 and his<br />\npassenger.<br />\nBack on the road.
