According to<br />\nGlazer, the world events fostering Israel's dependence upon<br />\nforce are leading Jews to become<br />\nmore conservative. \"American<br />\nJews have been brought to this<br />\n(conservatism) by facts,\" he<br />\nclaimed. \"They have been<br />\nbrought to realize that Israel can<br />\nonly survive through strength,\"<br />\nGlazer added, noting further<br />\nthat this traditionally liberal<br />\ngroup has shifted its political<br />\nideology on the basis that \"after<br />\nlooking at history, one starts to<br />\nbelieve in the power of force<br />\n<br />\nrather than the power of reason.\"<br />\nGlazer observed that American Jews have reluctantly accepted the idea that the world is<br />\nruled by force, not values. \"For<br />\nmost Jews, this realization is like<br />\nbeing shoved in a cold shower,\"<br />\nhe explained, adding that Jews<br />\nwho are opposed to military<br />\nforce have, come to realize its<br />\nnecessity.<br />\n\"The United States is the<br />\nonly outspoken supporter of<br />\nIsrael,\" Glazer noted.

Simons<br />\nintroduced<br />\nbegan by reading a letter that<br />\nRonald Reagan wrote to PATCO<br />\nwhile he was still a candidate<br />\nrunning for President. In the<br />\nletter Reagan condemend President Carter and promised cooperation between the presidency<br />\nand air traffic controllers. The<br />\naudience found this letter<br />\nwithin<br />\nbecause<br />\nhumorous<br />\nmonths of Reagan's inauguration, contract disputes led to a<br />\ncontrollers strike and President<br />\nReagan's firing of the striking<br />\nPATCO members who direct<br />\n<br />\nairplane traffic at all of the<br />\nnation's airports.<br />\nSimons attributed the labor<br />\ndispute to the Federal Aviation<br />\nAdministration (FAA), the<br />\nagency<br />\ngovernment<br />\nwhich<br />\n<br />\nMinn JIMUIIN 1.11.1113<br />\n<br />\noversees all air travel. Simons<br />\nexplained that the FAA always<br />\nholds air traffic controllers partially responsible for any airline<br />\naccident or mishap even if the<br />\ncontroller was not actually at<br />\n<br />\nPATCO and<br />\n<br />\nFAA<br />\n<br />\nes<br />\n<br />\nsersistzsc<br />\nuzapasa,a.<br />\n<br />\nfault. This, he said, is done so<br />\nthat the U.S. government appears to be acting responsibly.<br />\nThe problem, according to<br />\nSimons, is that this policy places<br />\ntoo much pressure on the<br />\ncontrollers. \"They see an unsympathetic FAA that is not supporting its own employees,\" he<br />\nsaid.<br />\nHe added that the FAA is<br />\nsubjected to political and economic pressures to maintain<br />\nminimum standards, and that<br />\nthe agency has in turn placed<br />\nheavy pressures on the air<br />\ncontrollers. \"I think that the<br />\ngovernment has to get out of the<br />\nair traffic controlling business,\"<br />\nSimons said, noting that prior to<br />\nthe 1940's, controlling was<br />\nhandled by private enterprise.<br />\nSimons believes that the<br />\ndissatisfaction with the FAA is<br />\nbroad-based. \"If striking were<br />\nlegal,\" he said,\"you would have<br />\nseen more than eighty percent of<br />\nthe controllers on strike. You<br />\nwould have seen one hundred<br />\npercent, or more than one<br />\nhundred percent because some<br />\nsupervisors would have walked<br />\nout also.\"<br />\nAlthough Simons feels that<br />\nthe strike was justified because<br />\nof the types of pressures placed<br />\non the controllers by the FAA,<br />\nhe said that the PATCO union<br />\nhandled the strike improperly.<br />\n\"PATCO didn't do its home-<br />\n<br />\nwork\" he remarked often during<br />\nthe forum.<br />\nBefore the strike was called,<br />\nhe said, union officials agreed on<br />\nwhat was needed to make it<br />\nsuccessful. The union felt that it<br />\nneeded the support of eight<br />\npercent of its membership. It<br />\nwas also necessary, according to<br />\nSimons, for the union to take<br />\naccount of the political as well<br />\nas the economic climate at the<br />\ntime of the strike.<br />\n\"PATCO didn't take its own<br />\nadvice,\" Simons claimed. \"The<br />\nstrike was designed for Carter,<br />\nnot Reagan,\" he added, noting<br />\nthat the President had just won<br />\ntwo major victories on Capitol<br />\nHill and was about to go on<br />\nvacation, and that Congress was<br />\nabout to recess when the controllers strike was called.<br />\nSimons feels that PATCO<br />\nwould have been better off if it<br />\nhad pressed Congress for reforms<br />\nafter negotiations broke down<br />\nwith the FAA. He said that<br />\nCongress would have been more<br />\nsympathetic to the needs of the<br />\ncontrollers.<br />\nAlthough he blamed the<br />\nPATCO organization for the bad<br />\npublicity and the firing of the<br />\ncontrollers that followed the<br />\nstrike, he maintained that the<br />\nproblems at issue were caused by<br />\nthe FAA.\"They wouldn't negotiate,\" he said. \"They wouldn't<br />\neven listen to our suggestions.\"<br />\n<br />\n\fPAGE 4 / NOVEMBER 6. 1981<br />\n<br />\nDon't Kill The Judicial Code<br />\n<br />\nThe Hopkins<br />\n<br />\nNews-Lefler<br />\nWe get turds in the mail, too.<br />\nThe .Vews-Letter is published weekly during the school year by the<br />\nstudents of the Johns llopkins University.

I have become<br />\nconvinced that the level of<br />\nmaturity here is entirely too<br />\nhigh. People look at the world<br />\nthrough the eyes of Plato,<br />\nDante, and Lehninger entirely<br />\ntoo often. There must be more<br />\nto life than intellectual discourses and self-analytical postulates. The question then arises:<br />\n\"What can we, mature individuals, do to become immature?\"<br />\nThe University itself has<br />\nstarted us on the road to Duck,<br />\nDuck, Goose.

The code's chief purpose<br />\nwas to provide all members of the Hopkins community with a means of pursuing<br />\ngrievances against students: a corollary aim<br />\nof the code was to protect the rights of the<br />\nstudent accused. Key features of the<br />\nproposed code were the right of the<br />\naccused to have his case heard by either<br />\na board of his peers or by the Director of<br />\nStudent Services: an appeal process: and<br />\nthe establishment of a Common Law Log<br />\nto maintain juridical precedents.<br />\nOn the one hand, the Council's<br />\nreason for tabling work on the code makes<br />\nsense: the code has been shot down twice<br />\nin referendum. From their point of view, it<br />\nisn't worth it to spend long hours reworking the code only to have it defeated. There<br />\nare other matters that need attention. and<br />\nat this point, the Council perception is that<br />\nthe code is doomed to rejection no matter<br />\nwhat changes in it are made. This year, the<br />\ncode would be up against a particularly<br />\n<br />\nhostile electorate: three of the four classes<br />\nhave seen it before and sent it packing.<br />\nYet, while the Council's action may<br />\nconceivably have the beneficial effect of<br />\nbringing to life diehard supporters of the<br />\ncode, it threatens at present to put the final<br />\nknife in the still-twitching document, and<br />\nin the end this would be the students' loss.<br />\nWhile there may have been many flaws in<br />\nthe code which was rejected last year, it<br />\nwas nevertheless an attempt to protect<br />\nstudents. One misconception about the<br />\ndocument, which may have ultimately<br />\nkilled it, was that it would actually make<br />\nthe student liable to a greater variety of<br />\npotential criminal charges than he was<br />\nbefore. For example. the code had a<br />\nprocedure for dealing with offenses committed by the student outside of Hopkins,<br />\nand many people believed that prior to the<br />\ncode the school would never have addressed such offenses. The truth is that the<br />\n- University has always had the prerogative<br />\nto punish students for such offenses; under<br />\nthe code, there would simply have been an<br />\nestablished procedure for doing so, one<br />\nthat might have provided additional safeguards for the student.<br />\nIn the end, it seems that student<br />\nresponse to the code has been emotional<br />\nand uninformed. It would be a shame to<br />\nsee the focus of so much work completely<br />\ntabled. Putting the code aside in the face of<br />\ncertain rejection makes sense, but attempts<br />\nshould be made to re-educate the students<br />\non this matter. Eventually, work on the<br />\ncode should continue.

Grant said Muller<br />\nwas aware that this figure<br />\n\"should be\" somewhere around<br />\n$5000.<br />\nOne factor which complicates the financial aid problem<br />\nat Hopkins, according to Grant,<br />\nis the unique structure of the<br />\ngraduate program.

He quoted<br />\nFrederick Douglass to emphasize<br />\nthat combating the new wave of<br />\nAmerican conservatism will require total mobilization: \"There<br />\ncan be no progress without a<br />\nstruggle, and a struggle there<br />\nwill be.\" He expressed faith in<br />\nMaryland, a state with a tradition of voting for pro-labor<br />\nDemocrats.<br />\nKoellein argued that the<br />\nopposition must \"keep casualties<br />\nto a minimum\" by fighting such<br />\nconservatives as Jesse Helms,<br />\nStrom Thurmond and Orrin<br />\nHatch. The Sept. 19 rally in<br />\nWashington and one planned for<br />\nFebruary in Annapolis are ways<br />\nhe suggested for people to voice<br />\ntheir discontent.<br />\nHe also said that the opposition must use voter registration<br />\ndrives to win support at the<br />\npolls. \"If we can't turn this<br />\ncountry around in 1982,\" he<br />\nadmitted, \"I don't know if<br />\nthere's any hope after that.\"<br />\nThe next speaker was Enolia<br />\nMcMillan, president of the<br />\nBaltimore Chapter of the<br />\nNAACP.\"Reaganism embodies a<br />\nnew philosophy in America,\"<br />\n<br />\nshe began, \"and therein lies the<br />\nproblem.\" She added that the<br />\ncapitalist system of supply and<br />\ndemand is not working and that<br />\nthe \"government is abdicating its<br />\nresponsibilities\" of protesting<br />\nthe poor from this system. She<br />\nstressed that Reagan's \"trickle<br />\ndown\" economics will never<br />\nsatisfy the demands of the<br />\nworkers.<br />\nMcMillan said President<br />\nReagan wants to \"water down\"<br />\nthe existing voting rights legislation and push tax cuts that favor<br />\nthe rich. \"This nation,\" she<br />\ncharged, \"is washing its hands of<br />\nresponsibility for any racial<br />\ndiscrimination.\"<br />\nThe NAACP president favored maintaining the present<br />\ncoalition against Reagan as a<br />\npartial solution to present problems. She also stressed giving the<br />\npublic \"not only an education of<br />\nthe head but of the heart, too.\"<br />\nShe explained, \"We can help<br />\nother people some. We don't<br />\nhave much money \u2014 some of us<br />\n\u2014 but we can share with others.\"<br />\nMcMillan suggested lobbying legislators by mail and<br />\ntelephone to express discontent<br />\nwith the current administration<br />\nin Washington: \"We must learn<br />\nto talk at the front gate.\"<br />\nLinda Thompson, the Solidarity Day coordinator, called<br />\nthe march \"beautiful and inspiring\" and attributed much of the<br />\nsuccess to Baltimore's participation.

She said the opposition<br />\n<br />\ncannot afford to wait for the<br />\n1982 elections to voice its<br />\nopinion. Moreover, she felt that<br />\nthe American political system<br />\nconstituted a \"bipartisan attack<br />\non workers,\" that workers must<br />\nform organizations independent<br />\nof the established parties.<br />\nDorothy Dobby of the<br />\nBaltimore Women's Coalition<br />\nwas the final speaker. She said<br />\nthe new cutbacks in government<br />\nexpenditures will affect women<br />\nmore than any other group. She<br />\nassured Koellein that there<br />\nwould be a large women's<br />\ncontingent at the February rally<br />\nin Annapolis to protest those<br />\ncutbacks and such proposed<br />\nlegislation as the Human Life<br />\nAmendment and the Family<br />\nProtection Act.<br />\nDuring the question and<br />\nanswer session which concluded<br />\nthe program, one audience member asked Koellein why labor<br />\nchooses to ally \u2022 with the Democratic Party rather than establishing its own party. Koellein<br />\nreplied that Marylanders have a<br />\ngood record for voter independence. Referring to his own<br />\nunion, however, he admitted,<br />\n\"Most of our members have<br />\ngone to sleep and our leaders are<br />\ngetting fat bellies.\"<br />\nAnother person in the audience claimed that the trade<br />\nunions do not represent the<br />\nworkers' needs.

Claude<br />\nBolling's Jazz Flute and Piano Concerto<br />\nplayed during scene changes and original<br />\n\"Bye-bye Blackbird\"-style songs sung to<br />\nShakespeare's lyrics made a curious and<br />\nsurprisingly unbothersome contrast with<br />\nthe antiquated English of the lines. When<br />\nwe remember that despite all the pleasant<br />\nfrivolity going on among these nobles<br />\nwithin the play, there is a bloody war<br />\ngoing on, the play takes on political<br />\novertones. Indeed, while these nobles get<br />\nvery worked up about their relationships,<br />\nperhaps ultimately it is Much Ado About<br />\nNothing. As the songster Balthazar says<br />\nbefore a song, \"Note this before my<br />\nnotes, there's not a note of mine that's<br />\nworth the noting.\" The play itself confesses to be merely entertaining; like the<br />\nnobles, the playwright is ignoring the war.<br />\n\"Shall I never see a bachelor of<br />\nthreescore again? Go to, i'faith! And thou<br />\nwilt needs thrust thy neck into a yoke,<br />\nwear the print of it, and sigh away<br />\nSundays.\" Benedick is a man with serious<br />\nqualms about marriage. Like Hamlet, he<br />\nis ever doubting, ever suspicious, and ever<br />\nprotecting himself from women. Claudio,<br />\na much-honored officer and noble, has<br />\nmindlessly fallen in love with the mindless Hero, and she him, and like the<br />\ndull-witted couple Woody Allen accosts<br />\nin the street in Annie Hall, their relationship is trouble free. To make this couple<br />\ninteresting, Shakespeare gives us the<br />\nvillain Don John, who, for the shabbiest<br />\nof motives, desires to ruin this happy<br />\n<br />\ncouple. Like lago, Don John uses clever<br />\ndeceptions to convince the gullible<br />\nClaudio that Hero is no hero but a whore.<br />\nTo solve this problem. Shakespeare sends<br />\nin Dogberry, the dim-witted and malaproping defender of justice. Benedict has<br />\ntroubles of his own, because the cast<br />\nmembers, jealous of his apparent wisdom,<br />\npersuade Benedick that Beatrice (the<br />\never-doubting, man-hating mirror image<br />\nof Benedick) has fallen wildly in love<br />\nwith him. He, being of essentially noble<br />\ncharacter, pities the misguided girl, and<br />\nconvinces himself that since he should<br />\nlove Beatrice, he does. Beatrice is similarly missiled by Hero_ and her maids.<br />\nThe witty exchanges between<br />\nBeatrice and Benedick are the high point<br />\nof the show. Their courtship, like two<br />\nporcupines trying to embrace, is amusing<br />\nand brings to the fore all our doubts<br />\nabout relationships. Lines like \u2022 \"We are<br />\ntoo witty to woo peaceable,\" and \"I love<br />\nthee, is that not strange?\" are far more<br />\nmodern than the idle doggerel bandied<br />\nabout in They're Playing Our Song<br />\n(which is playing at the Mechanic). But<br />\nwhen Beatrice asks Benedick, as proof of<br />\nhis love, to kill his friend Claudio, the<br />\n<br />\nClaudio (John Wojda) and Benedick (Terrance O'Quinn )<br />\naudience begins to have qualms more<br />\nserious than even Benedick's about<br />\nmale-female relationships.

It<br />\nturned out the film was Pink Flamingos, and from the<br />\nopening shot of the pink-and-gray trailer to the final<br />\nscene of Divine running dogshit through her teeth, I<br />\ncould gradually feel my previous world view taking<br />\nan irrevocable dive. Walking out of the theater, I imagined myself having just redrunk my first beer, having<br />\nset off my first M-80, having clogged up my first urinal.<br />\nAgain, all of those low-budget rock 'n' roll films I had<br />\nseen suddenly came together with the force of a perforated ulcer; the worst of it, however, was the horrible<br />\nrealization that everyone around me had been conspiring<br />\nviciously to keep me from knowing what I had to<br />\ndiscover eventually \u2014 that is, as John Waters has so aptly<br />\nput it, that \"bad taste is what entertainment is all<br />\nabout.\"<br />\n<br />\nThe<br />\nreason I relate this incident is ultimate<br />\nly<br />\ntied to my feelings about both Waters<br />\nand his first<br />\nbook, Shock Value (New York: Delta, 981, $9.95). I<br />\nhave read the book three times now,and my opinion of it<br />\nhas not altered;for me it represents not only a tribute to<br />\nthe author's perception of the world and of human nature, but also a compelling and entertaining chronicle of<br />\nthe activities of a group of people \u2014 the Dreamlanders \u2014<br />\nwho possessed the ability to exploit the shocking, silly,<br />\nand mundane aspects of both urban and suburban<br />\n\"acceptable\" conventions. This is not to proclaim that<br />\nthe book is perfect, insofar as its language and consistency are concerned, but just to say that what Waters<br />\nhas written carries no less historical value than, say, the<br />\nworks of Tom Wolfe, and certainly more value than<br />\nanything Arnold Toynbee ever puked up onto the page.<br />\nOn the other hand, Shock Value is hardly straight<br />\nhistory; it is overtly set up as autobiography, while at<br />\nthe same time it educates a generally uninformed public<br />\nabout those few who couldn't have cared less about the<br />\nBeatles, Berkeley,or Woodstock.<br />\n<br />\n\"I'm hardly what you'd<br />\ncall a mellow person.\"<br />\nfrom Chapter 2<br />\n\"Why I Love Violence\"<br />\n<br />\nShock Value, in justifying its title, could<br />\nnever have been written<br />\nas a chronicled autobiography, beginning with<br />\nWater's childhood in Lutherville, a suburb north of<br />\nBaltimore City. The first chapter, titled \"The Filthiest<br />\nPeople Alive,\" allows the reader to be introduced to<br />\nWaters' philosophy in print by the same method a fair<br />\nnumber of people have been introduced to it in his films<br />\n\u2014 that is, by describing in detail the circumstances<br />\nbehind, and the making of,Pink Flamingos.<br />\n<br />\nWaters' intent, both in writing the<br />\nbook and making his films, appears<br />\nnot to arise out of a desire to record<br />\nhis life within his characters;<br />\nrather, after reading the book,<br />\nseeing the films, and discussing the subject with him, I<br />\nam firmly convinced that his chief purposes are to express his personal tastes and to make people laugh at his<br />\nworks. This, of course, is something he freely admits but<br />\nhas a difficult time conveying to his film audiences; in<br />\nother words, people who might assume that Waters's<br />\nproducts constitute \"art\" films or that they reflect his<br />\npersonal lifestyle are, in the director's opinion, totally<br />\nmisreading him. I bring up this point because, in the<br />\n<br />\nGOOD BAD TASTE<br />\n<br />\nBAD BAD TASTE<br />\nNoteworthy incidents from the author's delinquent<br />\nyouth are scattered throughout the book, and the final<br />\n\u2022 chapter (\"Do You Have Parents?\") discusses how Mr.<br />\nand Mrs. Waters put up with, moreover supported, his<br />\nearly filmmaking efforts. Thus, in place of a formal<br />\nintroduction, rather than slowly building up to the point<br />\nwhere the reader might well expect and be prepared<br />\nfor the subject of Pink Flamingos, Waters puts it right up<br />\nfront where it appears most conspicuous. In subsequent<br />\nchapters, at least for most of the book, he alternates<br />\nbetween stating the many-faceted contents of his ideology and the personal experiences which led him to book, Waters goes out of his way to assure the reader<br />\ndevelop self-asserted deviant attitudes.<br />\nthat he is not now, nor has he ever been, the demented<br />\nlunatic people make him out to be. This idea bothered<br />\nme the first time I read the book; I was curious as to<br />\nwhy he felt the need to strip away the image he so masFor the most part, the chap- terfully cultivated, and pictured hordes of disappointed<br />\nters seem to fit into fans vowing never to see another John Waters film again.<br />\nfour categories: (1) It was almost as if the act of stripping away the mythothose concerned logy was being used vindictively, as if Waters was putwith<br />\nparticular ting himself on the defensive for no apparent reason.<br />\nprojects, such as Earlier this month I interviewed the filmmaker in his<br />\nFemale<br />\nTrouble, West Baltimore apartment, in the hope that he might<br />\nDesperate<br />\nLiving, clarify what I saw as a rather bizarre position to take:<br />\nand Pink Flamingos;<br />\n(2) those dealing with<br />\nWaters'<br />\nmajor influ- News-Letter: One of the things that<br />\nences, such as the sections bothered me about the book was the<br />\non Baltimore, murder tri- fact that I thought you were bein<br />\nals, and Russ Meyer and apologetic at times.<br />\nHersc.hell Gordon Lewis John Waters: About what?<br />\n(two great trash di<br />\nN-L: I'm thinking of, say, in the<br />\nrectors); profiles of closing paragraph of the book \u2014<br />\nhis biggest stars, \"I only think terrible thoughts,<br />\nDivine<br />\nand I do not live them.

For Waters, contrarily, nothing in New York \u2014 or anywhere else for that<br />\nmatter \u2014 comes even close to providing him with the<br />\nsort of material he requires to formulate the stories<br />\nwhich eventually find their way into his films. He devotes an entire chapter of Shock Value to the purpose of<br />\nintroducing the uninitiated to Baltimore sleaze. By far<br />\n,the most entertaining portion of the chapter is the part<br />\ndescribing Belair Road \u2014 \"the best 'hair-don't' area in<br />\nBaltimore\" \u2014 but in fact, all of the paragraphs devoted<br />\nto the hairdo phenomenon in this city will undoubtedly<br />\ncause eczema scales on even the most fashion-conscious<br />\nof New Yorkers. For example: \"Eastern Avenue is<br />\nanother fertile spot for watching hairdos, and you can<br />\nusually see women struggling to fit their huge heads<br />\ninto their cars as the wind blows old newspapers and garbage up against them.\"<br />\n<br />\nN-L: And you really thought it was necessary to state<br />\nthat outright in the book?<br />\nWaters: Well yes!

I go<br />\nto colleges and they say, \"Do you still live in the trailer?\" I mean, some people believe those movies, which is<br />\nflattering, but it's sort of scary; you should see the mail I<br />\nget. Especially since this book has come out, I've gotten<br />\nweirder mail than I've ever gotten from the movies \u2014<br />\npeople saying \"I quit my job after I read your book<br />\ntoday, and I'm either going to make a movie or kill<br />\nsomebody; and if I kill somebody I'm going to kill more<br />\nthan one because it's more economical media-wise, and<br />\nI'll save you a front seat at my trial.\" That was one letter<br />\nI got this week. So that's why maybe I'm clarifying<br />\nthings.<br />\n<br />\n\"The first thing you will<br />\nnotice are the hairdos.<br />\nBaltimore women have,<br />\nper capita, higher hair<br />\nthan their counterparts<br />\nin any other American<br />\ncity.\" from Chapter 4<br />\n\"Baltimore, Maryland<br />\nHairdo Capital<br />\nOf the World\"<br />\n<br />\nEven if one considers the tacky turn toward commerseems to be taking,<br />\ncialism that Baltimore<br />\nagree that the \"eleone must ultimately<br />\nhas continually paroment\" which Waters<br />\nnever disappear<br />\ndied in his films will<br />\nople who have<br />\nfrom the city. Pe<br />\nknow exactly<br />\nseen his films<br />\nI'm talking<br />\nwhat element<br />\nphenomenon<br />\nabout: \u2014 the<br />\npie: those<br />\nof white peo<br />\nincredibly biwho exhibit<br />\nnd behavior not<br />\nzarre fashions a<br />\neir European<br />\nindigenous to th<br />\nbackgrounds, but rather styles which they have adopted<br />\nsince moving to Baltimore; and it.seems to me that<br />\nWaters is confident that these characteristics peculiar<br />\nto Baltimoreans are positively hereditary, given the<br />\ninsular nature of Baltimore culture. For, him, the act<br />\nof parodying silly and sensational behavior is an example<br />\nof good bad taste. Bad bad taste would constitute, say, a<br />\nfilm whose purpose it was merely to show people getting<br />\ndecapitated and otherwise hacked up \u2014 devoid of<br />\nany humor, stylishness, or imagination. I believe that<br />\nWaters is essentially correct in forming a dichotomy<br />\nbetween the two, that his assertions concerning the basis<br />\nof good entertainment have been proven to be true ovei<br />\nthe years, whether they manifest themselves in the form<br />\nof movies, plays, books, or songs. For this reason it is<br />\nnot surprising, for instance, that Waters claims that he<br />\nstopped listening to new music at about the same time<br />\nthe Beatles started becoming popular; socially redeeming<br />\nart formc have no place in his conception of style.<br />\n<br />\nShould Waters' fans and readers of Shock Value be<br />\ndisappointed that the man does not live like the characters in his films? I think not. We are all aware that there<br />\nexist, and have always existed, real people who behave<br />\nlike the people he portrays, somewhere in the world, or<br />\nin Baltimore at least. Those who feel betrayed by John<br />\nWaters's sensibilities, as related in the book, must realize<br />\nthat if he actually did live like his films' characters, it is<br />\nunlikely that he ever would have been able to distance<br />\nhimself from his own sleaziness enough to write about<br />\nit.<br />\n<br />\nWhen interviewing Waters, I was particularly<br />\ninterested in his recent views in regard to what Baltimore<br />\nis becoming, what with the large amount of money that<br />\nhas been pouring into the city in the past few years, and<br />\nhow he felt about his own living situation here, at this<br />\ntime:<br />\nN-L: About this city, besides the obvious things, such as<br />\nthe building up of the harbor area\u2014<br />\nWaters: Well (laughs) I'm not exactly part of that.<br />\nN-L: I'm interested in what you think about the \"gentrification\" of the city, whether it might produced a new<br />\nand interesting \"element.\"<br />\nWaters: Oh, it just makes the rents go up and more<br />\nliberals from Washington will move near me; and you<br />\ncan always tell the first sign \u2014 plants in the windows \u2014<br />\nthat you know your rent's going to go up. I am content<br />\nto live on the \"afro-clean\" block...Now here, I like to<br />\nlive in a neighborhood where I'm not nervous about<br />\nbeing robbed because the robbers live in this neighborhood; they take the bus down to Bolton Hill if they<br />\nwant to rob. If you live in a city, you should live where<br />\nthe robbers live, not where they rob. I think Bolton Hill<br />\nis probably the most dangerous neighborhood in Baltimore.<br />\n<br />\nThis and other tasteless photos in this article are from<br />\nJohn Waters' hook Shock Value.<br />\n<br />\n\fPAGE 14 / NOVEMBER 6, 1981<br />\n<br />\n\u201e<br />\newood G.<br />\n<br />\nWE CAN GIVE YOU<br />\nTHE LOWESTSTICKER<br />\nPRICE ON YOUR<br />\nAUTO INSURANCE IF...<br />\n<br />\n+0<br />\n<br />\no<br />\nC<br />\nQ<br />\n<br />\nYOU CAN ANSWER YESTO<br />\nTHESE FOUR QUESTIONS:<br />\nYES NO<br />\n1 Do all operators of your<br />\ncar(s) have driving<br />\nrecords free of moving<br />\nviolations or convictions for at least the past<br />\nthree years,<br />\n2 Have all operators of<br />\nyour car(s) been<br />\nlicensed drivers for<br />\nthe past six years or<br />\nlonger,<br />\n3 Do you use your car(s) for<br />\npleasure purposes, including light commuting?<br />\n4 Have you had a claimfree record for<br />\nthe past three years?<br />\n<br />\nE<br />\n<br />\nEl II<br />\nLJ<br />\n<br />\nEl El<br />\n<br />\nThursday Nights<br />\n<br />\nPaul Trattner<br />\n<br />\nThe Magician<br />\n<br />\nBuick Skylark, Dodge Aspen,<br />\nPlymouth Volare, or a number of<br />\nother models that our research<br />\nhas shown cost less to repair.<br />\nCustom Auto could save you<br />\neven more. .411 together up to<br />\n20'4 annually.<br />\nPlus, if you are still with the<br />\nCustom Auto Program after<br />\nthree years and you have no<br />\nclaims . . . you can qualify for<br />\nadditional premium credits.<br />\nSo before you go shopping<br />\nfor a new car for yourself. . .<br />\nor a second car for your family<br />\n. . . stop in to see us about<br />\nCustom Auto.<br />\n<br />\nWere you able to answer<br />\nyes to four or close to it?

Originally designed to be<br />\ncalled Discipline, after a tour under that<br />\nname in England they came back as King<br />\nCrimson. Apparently they realized that<br />\nthe music they play incorporates many of<br />\nthe same sounds and concepts that<br />\nKing Crimson originally had, and that<br />\nthey were unavoidably becoming another<br />\nKing Crimson. Also the name of the<br />\nband provides a convenient backdrop of<br />\nfamiliarity that helps gain interest and<br />\npublicity for them when they would<br />\notherwise be rather obscure.<br />\nThe band's goal seems to be to<br />\nplay music that is different from anything<br />\never played before, yet when listening it's<br />\neasy to pick out familiar sounds that the<br />\nvarious members played when working on<br />\nother projects. The result is that the<br />\nsound of the band is like a culmination of<br />\nthe styles which the four musicians<br />\ndeveloped individually over the years. In<br />\nthe song \"Thela Hun Ginjeet\" the combination of Bruford's rhythmic, Africaninfluenced percussion with the chanting<br />\nvocals of Belew and searing guitar of<br />\nFripp is very similar to the sound pioneered by Talking Heads mastermind<br />\nDavid Byrne and synthesizer genius<br />\nBrian Eno, by whom Belew and Fripp<br />\nThe<br />\nhave been heavily influenced.<br />\ninstrumental \"The Sheltering Sky\"<br />\nhas an ambience that sounds very much<br />\nlike Eno-Fripp collaborations, yet the<br />\npowerful duets between Fripp and Belew,<br />\ncombined with the simple percussion of<br />\nBruford and Levin's steady rhythms on<br />\n<br />\nthe Garrett Room in the MSE Library.<br />\nThe Kyrios Dancers will discuss and<br />\ndemonstrate dance as a form of prayer,<br />\nthe origins of dance and its use in bringing man closer to his god. Admission is<br />\nfree and open to the public.<br />\n<br />\nhis stick-bass provides a sound that has<br />\nnever been fully developed before. The<br />\ntitle track of the album sounds very much<br />\nlike the music of Fripp's League of Gentlemen project in the style of its progressions, yet it has a much more interesting<br />\nflavor. This is the tone of the whole album, for we hear things that have been<br />\nhinted at before, yet never before combined into this sort of sound.<br />\nAt the concert at Painters Mill on<br />\nNov. 4 I was prepared to hear a very<br />\ndifferent type of sound live than on the<br />\nalbum, because I didn't think Crimson<br />\ncould reproduce the \"studio\" effects of<br />\nthe album live, yet the group added even<br />\nmore interesting sounds when they were<br />\nplaying live. Each musician was getting an<br />\nincredibly varied amount of sounds from<br />\nhis instruments, and in such a casual way<br />\nthat the enthusiastic audience was in awe<br />\nof their talents. Although the group<br />\nplayed all of their new album, King<br />\nCrimson also played from the last two of<br />\nits albums, Red and Lark's Tongue in<br />\nAspic, which sent the hardcore Crimson<br />\nfans wild. They also played some of their<br />\nunreleased material, which sounds promising and is something to look forward to<br />\non a future album.<br />\nIn this age of \"dead-end\" music,\"<br />\nwhere the common consensus seems to be<br />\nthat there isn't anything left to play, King<br />\nCrimson shows us that we don't have to<br />\nrevive old styles of music in desperation<br />\nfor an interesting new sound, and the<br />\ngroup provides a refreshing new outlook<br />\nfor future music.<br />\n<br />\nIM<br />\n<br />\nMB lin<br />\n<br />\n(AS LOW AS 500) PLUS<br />\n\u2022 SPECIAL PRIZES AND GIVEAWAYS<br />\nFor the benefit of the<br />\nI<br />\nJohns Hopkins Tutorial Project<br />\nI<br />\nFRIDAY, NOV-13, 11:00 AM to 8:00 PM<br />\nGlass Pavilion,Johns Hopkins University<br />\nHomewood Campus<br />\ndonated up to the time of<br />\nContributions of recordings and equipment may be<br />\nChaplain at 338-8188<br />\nthe<br />\nof<br />\nOffice<br />\nthe sale.

With 40 seconds-to go<br />\nin the first half the Blue Jays<br />\nheld a slight edge, 8-7, mostly<br />\ndue to their defense.<br />\nOn the first possession of<br />\nthe game, the Blue Jay offense<br />\ncouldn't get on track, and had to<br />\npunt the ball away. On the<br />\nensuing possession by the<br />\nColonels, the defense held them<br />\nto nothing on their first play,<br />\nbut then on second and ten. Jeff<br />\nKendall got called for pass<br />\ninterference on his own 48-yard<br />\nline, and that seemed to ignite<br />\nthe offense. Seven plays later<br />\nfullback Bob Hessling ran a<br />\nfourth down, 19-yard pass into<br />\nthe end zone, giving Wilkes the<br />\nlead with 9:08 to go in the first<br />\nquarter. That touchdown and<br />\nextra point was only the 40th<br />\npoint scored this year by the<br />\nColonels. They came into the<br />\ngame with a record of 0-6.<br />\nAfter trading punts, the<br />\nBlue Jays took over the ball<br />\nafter a 29-yard punt and a<br />\nsix-yard return at the Wilkes 29.<br />\nThe Blue Jays, who had been<br />\nsuccessful with the pass on first<br />\ndown, ran a draw to Bob<br />\nSternfeld as their first play from<br />\nscrimmage, and he took it all the<br />\nway to the 11. Brian Kane took<br />\nthe next play on the ground to<br />\nthe eight, and then Sternfeld got<br />\nthe call again.

Five seniors were lost<br />\nfrom last year's team, including<br />\nfour of the seven national<br />\nchamipons and three-fourths of<br />\nthe winning relay team. \"We're<br />\nyoung, but we'll be more exciting this year,\" says Welsh.<br />\n\"Judging from their high school<br />\ntimes, this year's freshmen are<br />\nthe fastest I've had in my five<br />\nyear's coaching here.\" Ten freshmen are on the team, at least six<br />\nof whom are expected to join<br />\nthe national squad.<br />\nSince all MAC teams are<br />\ninvited to the MAC tournament,<br />\nthe regular season is essentially a<br />\ntune-up for the tournament, and<br />\nmore important, the Nationals in<br />\nMarch., Each team sends as many<br />\nswimmers as can beat the<br />\nnational qualifying time by<br />\nMarch 5. Each school sends a<br />\nmaximum of 18 swimmers, a<br />\nnumber that the Jays would love<br />\n<br />\nthough practices don't officially<br />\nstart until mid-October. A \"dry<br />\nland program\" using running,<br />\nweight training and conditioning<br />\nexercise techniques was implemented several years ago, but<br />\nyear round swimming is still the<br />\n<br />\nto match.

Many swimmers graduated last year, including Gale Berkowitz and Monica<br />\nBay. Welsh has more swimmers<br />\nthis year than ever before, but<br />\nthey are also more inexperienced. Even though the team<br />\nwill be stronger in diving than it<br />\nhas ever been, it is not very<br />\nversatile yet, and there will be<br />\nsome holes in the lineup.<br />\nIt is a very young team,<br />\nincluding only two seniors and<br />\nmany freshmen and sophomores.<br />\nThe future looks very good, as<br />\nthe team will benefit from this<br />\nyear's improvements during the<br />\nnext few seasons.<br />\nThe Jays are led this year by<br />\nco-captains Anne Aronowitz and<br />\nTracey Smith.

On<br />\nNov. 19 the Jays will host<br />\nDickinson, a much improved<br />\nteam which the coach believes<br />\nwill be a good test for his young<br />\nsquad. Hopkins' own rivals,<br />\nGettysburg, will be coming to<br />\nHomewood Dec. 2. Defending<br />\nMAC champion Gettysburg will<br />\nbe very hard to beat, having its<br />\nfastest team ever this year.<br />\nWelsh points to the team's<br />\nhard work, as it has been practicing in water for more than a<br />\nmonth. Changes have been made<br />\nin the training program, and so<br />\nfar the swimmers look good and<br />\nare optimistic. But is a young<br />\nand inexperienced team, with its<br />\nleaders being strong and fast<br />\nbut not numerous.

Dr.<br />\nNathan Glazer, a professor of<br />\neducation and sociology at<br />\nHarvard University and author<br />\nof several books on Judaism and<br />\nimmigration, spoke before a<br />\ncrowd of nearly 175 people on<br />\n\"The Persistence of Ethnicity:<br />\nJewish Immigration to the United States.\"<br />\nGlazer said Israel is becoming more and more dependent<br />\nupon military force as a means<br />\nfor survival. According to<br />\nGlazer, the world events fostering Israel's dependence upon<br />\nforce are leading Jews to become<br />\nmore conservative. \"American<br />\nJews have been brought to this<br />\n(conservatism) by facts,\" he<br />\nclaimed. \"They have been<br />\nbrought to realize that Israel can<br />\nonly survive through strength,\"<br />\nGlazer added, noting further<br />\nthat this traditionally liberal<br />\ngroup has shifted its political<br />\nideology on the basis that \"after<br />\nlooking at history, one starts to<br />\nbelieve in the power of force<br /><br />\nrather than the power of reason.\"<br />\nGlazer observed that American Jews have reluctantly accepted the idea that the world is<br />\nruled by force, not values. \"For<br />\nmost Jews, this realization is like<br />\nbeing shoved in a cold shower,\"<br />\nhe explained, adding that Jews<br />\nwho are opposed to military<br />\nforce have, come to realize its<br />\nnecessity.<br />\n\"The United States is the<br />\nonly outspoken supporter of<br />\nIsrael,\" Glazer noted. He explained that most countries of<br />\nthe world are hostile toward the<br />\nJewish state. \"Israel is by far<br />\nthe greatest recipient of United<br />\nStates aid,\" he said.<br />\nGlazer said that America's<br />\nsupport of Israel stems from ties<br />\nof interest and sympathy.\"Sympathy and strategy keep the<br />\nUnited States almost alone in<br />\nthe world in support of Israel,\"<br />\nhe commented.<br />\nOne reason for this attitude<br />\nis \"the prevention of communist<br />\nexpansion, (which is) a present<br />\ntheme of American foreign policy.\" Another factor is that Israel<br />\nis strategically important to<br />\nthe United States. \"As instabil-<br /><br />\nity in the Arab world becomes<br />\nevident, American strategies favor Egypt and Israel,\" said<br />\nGlazer.<br />\nThe main reason for this<br />\ninterest, which in turn promoted<br />\nthe American Jews' political<br />\nideological shift to conservatism,<br />\nis the presence of what Glazer<br />\ncalled their \"primal connection\"<br />\nwith Israel.

Simons<br />\nintroduced<br />\nbegan by reading a letter that<br />\nRonald Reagan wrote to PATCO<br />\nwhile he was still a candidate<br />\nrunning for President. In the<br />\nletter Reagan condemend President Carter and promised cooperation between the presidency<br />\nand air traffic controllers. The<br />\naudience found this letter<br />\nwithin<br />\nbecause<br />\nhumorous<br />\nmonths of Reagan's inauguration, contract disputes led to a<br />\ncontrollers strike and President<br />\nReagan's firing of the striking<br />\nPATCO members who direct<br /><br />\nairplane traffic at all of the<br />\nnation's airports.<br />\nSimons attributed the labor<br />\ndispute to the Federal Aviation<br />\nAdministration (FAA), the<br />\nagency<br />\ngovernment<br />\nwhich<br /><br />\nMinn JIMUIIN 1.11.1113<br /><br />\noversees all air travel. Simons<br />\nexplained that the FAA always<br />\nholds air traffic controllers partially responsible for any airline<br />\naccident or mishap even if the<br />\ncontroller was not actually at<br /><br />\nPATCO and<br /><br />\nFAA<br /><br />\nes<br /><br />\nsersistzsc<br />\nuzapasa,a.<br /><br />\nfault. This, he said, is done so<br />\nthat the U.S. government appears to be acting responsibly.<br />\nThe problem, according to<br />\nSimons, is that this policy places<br />\ntoo much pressure on the<br />\ncontrollers. \"They see an unsympathetic FAA that is not supporting its own employees,\" he<br />\nsaid.<br />\nHe added that the FAA is<br />\nsubjected to political and economic pressures to maintain<br />\nminimum standards, and that<br />\nthe agency has in turn placed<br />\nheavy pressures on the air<br />\ncontrollers. \"I think that the<br />\ngovernment has to get out of the<br />\nair traffic controlling business,\"<br />\nSimons said, noting that prior to<br />\nthe 1940's, controlling was<br />\nhandled by private enterprise.<br />\nSimons believes that the<br />\ndissatisfaction with the FAA is<br />\nbroad-based. \"If striking were<br />\nlegal,\" he said,\"you would have<br />\nseen more than eighty percent of<br />\nthe controllers on strike. You<br />\nwould have seen one hundred<br />\npercent, or more than one<br />\nhundred percent because some<br />\nsupervisors would have walked<br />\nout also.\"<br />\nAlthough Simons feels that<br />\nthe strike was justified because<br />\nof the types of pressures placed<br />\non the controllers by the FAA,<br />\nhe said that the PATCO union<br />\nhandled the strike improperly.<br />\n\"PATCO didn't do its home-<br /><br />\nwork\" he remarked often during<br />\nthe forum.<br />\nBefore the strike was called,<br />\nhe said, union officials agreed on<br />\nwhat was needed to make it<br />\nsuccessful. The union felt that it<br />\nneeded the support of eight<br />\npercent of its membership. It<br />\nwas also necessary, according to<br />\nSimons, for the union to take<br />\naccount of the political as well<br />\nas the economic climate at the<br />\ntime of the strike.<br />\n\"PATCO didn't take its own<br />\nadvice,\" Simons claimed. \"The<br />\nstrike was designed for Carter,<br />\nnot Reagan,\" he added, noting<br />\nthat the President had just won<br />\ntwo major victories on Capitol<br />\nHill and was about to go on<br />\nvacation, and that Congress was<br />\nabout to recess when the controllers strike was called.<br />\nSimons feels that PATCO<br />\nwould have been better off if it<br />\nhad pressed Congress for reforms<br />\nafter negotiations broke down<br />\nwith the FAA. He said that<br />\nCongress would have been more<br />\nsympathetic to the needs of the<br />\ncontrollers.<br />\nAlthough he blamed the<br />\nPATCO organization for the bad<br />\npublicity and the firing of the<br />\ncontrollers that followed the<br />\nstrike, he maintained that the<br />\nproblems at issue were caused by<br />\nthe FAA.\"They wouldn't negotiate,\" he said. \"They wouldn't<br />\neven listen to our suggestions.\"<br /><br />\nPAGE 4 / NOVEMBER 6. 1981<br /><br />\nDon't Kill The Judicial Code<br /><br />\nThe Hopkins<br /><br />\nNews-Lefler<br />\nWe get turds in the mail, too.<br />\nThe .Vews-Letter is published weekly during the school year by the<br />\nstudents of the Johns llopkins University.

KARRAS<br />\nAfter having spent four<br />\nsemesters in a state far from bliss<br />\nat this esteemed institution of<br />\nhigher learning. I have become<br />\nconvinced that the level of<br />\nmaturity here is entirely too<br />\nhigh. People look at the world<br />\nthrough the eyes of Plato,<br />\nDante, and Lehninger entirely<br />\ntoo often. There must be more<br />\nto life than intellectual discourses and self-analytical postulates. The question then arises:<br />\n\"What can we, mature individuals, do to become immature?\"<br />\nThe University itself has<br />\nstarted us on the road to Duck,<br />\nDuck, Goose. It has provided us<br />\nwith a dose of pablum, the first<br /><br />\ndrools of which have fallen on<br />\nthe Reserve Room. Over the<br />\nsummer, study carrels were<br />\nerected there, successfully raising the noise levels in one<br />\nof the campus hot spots and<br />\nopening up the possibilities for<br />\nspit balls, elaborately drawn<br />\nbattle plans (does one'fire over<br />\nor under the wall), and of<br />\ncourse, overnight entrenchments.<br />\nEven more can be done.<br />\nThe Reserve Room should stock<br />\nMarvel Comics and put on puppet<br />\nshows from behind the reserve<br />\ndesk each night at nine (two<br />\nshows on Sundays).

The heartbreak of rejection proved to<br />\nbe more than the code could withstand,<br />\nand the Student Council finally put it to<br />\nsleep this week.<br />\nWhile the Council's action is understandable in light of previous response to<br />\nthe code, it ultimately goes too far. A<br />\njudicial code created by students could<br />\nand should govern the process of hearing<br />\nstudent offenses.<br />\nVeterans of Homewood have heard<br />\nmore about the code than they probably<br />\ncared to since the initial proposal in 1977,<br />\nbut for freshmen perhaps a little explanation is in order. The code's chief purpose<br />\nwas to provide all members of the Hopkins community with a means of pursuing<br />\ngrievances against students: a corollary aim<br />\nof the code was to protect the rights of the<br />\nstudent accused. Key features of the<br />\nproposed code were the right of the<br />\naccused to have his case heard by either<br />\na board of his peers or by the Director of<br />\nStudent Services: an appeal process: and<br />\nthe establishment of a Common Law Log<br />\nto maintain juridical precedents.<br />\nOn the one hand, the Council's<br />\nreason for tabling work on the code makes<br />\nsense: the code has been shot down twice<br />\nin referendum. From their point of view, it<br />\nisn't worth it to spend long hours reworking the code only to have it defeated. There<br />\nare other matters that need attention. and<br />\nat this point, the Council perception is that<br />\nthe code is doomed to rejection no matter<br />\nwhat changes in it are made. This year, the<br />\ncode would be up against a particularly<br /><br />\nhostile electorate: three of the four classes<br />\nhave seen it before and sent it packing.<br />\nYet, while the Council's action may<br />\nconceivably have the beneficial effect of<br />\nbringing to life diehard supporters of the<br />\ncode, it threatens at present to put the final<br />\nknife in the still-twitching document, and<br />\nin the end this would be the students' loss.<br />\nWhile there may have been many flaws in<br />\nthe code which was rejected last year, it<br />\nwas nevertheless an attempt to protect<br />\nstudents. One misconception about the<br />\ndocument, which may have ultimately<br />\nkilled it, was that it would actually make<br />\nthe student liable to a greater variety of<br />\npotential criminal charges than he was<br />\nbefore. For example. the code had a<br />\nprocedure for dealing with offenses committed by the student outside of Hopkins,<br />\nand many people believed that prior to the<br />\ncode the school would never have addressed such offenses. The truth is that the<br />\n- University has always had the prerogative<br />\nto punish students for such offenses; under<br />\nthe code, there would simply have been an<br />\nestablished procedure for doing so, one<br />\nthat might have provided additional safeguards for the student.<br />\nIn the end, it seems that student<br />\nresponse to the code has been emotional<br />\nand uninformed. It would be a shame to<br />\nsee the focus of so much work completely<br />\ntabled. Putting the code aside in the face of<br />\ncertain rejection makes sense, but attempts<br />\nshould be made to re-educate the students<br />\non this matter. Eventually, work on the<br />\ncode should continue. We should support<br />\nour own efforts to protect ourselves.<br /><br />\nLetters to the Editor<br />\nWe Said Overzealous<br /><br />\nalways the first to deny it to<br />\nothers.<br />\nTo the Editor:<br />\nThe following day I met<br />\nwith Rev.

Grant said Muller<br />\nwas aware that this figure<br />\n\"should be\" somewhere around<br />\n$5000.<br />\nOne factor which complicates the financial aid problem<br />\nat Hopkins, according to Grant,<br />\nis the unique structure of the<br />\ngraduate program. There is no<br /><br />\ngraduate school per se; rather,<br />\nthe departments operate as<br />\nautonomous units.

Though the killings<br />\nwere documented on the tape<br />\nand this tape was used in the<br />\ntrial, the Klansmen involved<br />\nwere acquitted. DuBose then<br />\nrecounted KKK activities over<br />\nthe past century and a half,<br />\naccusing the government of tacit<br />\nacceptance of the group's methods.<br />\nDuBose also commented on<br />\nthe Atlanta child murders. She<br />\nsaid that many parents of the<br />\nslain children believe that the<br />\nkiller is in uniform (FBI or<br />\nWayne<br />\nthat<br />\npolice), and<br />\nWilliams, the man charged with<br />\nthe slayings, is being framed.<br /><br />\nwell as a crime prevention<br />\ncenter.

He quoted<br />\nFrederick Douglass to emphasize<br />\nthat combating the new wave of<br />\nAmerican conservatism will require total mobilization: \"There<br />\ncan be no progress without a<br />\nstruggle, and a struggle there<br />\nwill be.\" He expressed faith in<br />\nMaryland, a state with a tradition of voting for pro-labor<br />\nDemocrats.<br />\nKoellein argued that the<br />\nopposition must \"keep casualties<br />\nto a minimum\" by fighting such<br />\nconservatives as Jesse Helms,<br />\nStrom Thurmond and Orrin<br />\nHatch. The Sept. 19 rally in<br />\nWashington and one planned for<br />\nFebruary in Annapolis are ways<br />\nhe suggested for people to voice<br />\ntheir discontent.<br />\nHe also said that the opposition must use voter registration<br />\ndrives to win support at the<br />\npolls. \"If we can't turn this<br />\ncountry around in 1982,\" he<br />\nadmitted, \"I don't know if<br />\nthere's any hope after that.\"<br />\nThe next speaker was Enolia<br />\nMcMillan, president of the<br />\nBaltimore Chapter of the<br />\nNAACP.\"Reaganism embodies a<br />\nnew philosophy in America,\"<br /><br />\nshe began, \"and therein lies the<br />\nproblem.\" She added that the<br />\ncapitalist system of supply and<br />\ndemand is not working and that<br />\nthe \"government is abdicating its<br />\nresponsibilities\" of protesting<br />\nthe poor from this system. She<br />\nstressed that Reagan's \"trickle<br />\ndown\" economics will never<br />\nsatisfy the demands of the<br />\nworkers.<br />\nMcMillan said President<br />\nReagan wants to \"water down\"<br />\nthe existing voting rights legislation and push tax cuts that favor<br />\nthe rich. \"This nation,\" she<br />\ncharged, \"is washing its hands of<br />\nresponsibility for any racial<br />\ndiscrimination.\"<br />\nThe NAACP president favored maintaining the present<br />\ncoalition against Reagan as a<br />\npartial solution to present problems. She also stressed giving the<br />\npublic \"not only an education of<br />\nthe head but of the heart, too.\"<br />\nShe explained, \"We can help<br />\nother people some. We don't<br />\nhave much money \u2014 some of us<br />\n\u2014 but we can share with others.\"<br />\nMcMillan suggested lobbying legislators by mail and<br />\ntelephone to express discontent<br />\nwith the current administration<br />\nin Washington: \"We must learn<br />\nto talk at the front gate.\"<br />\nLinda Thompson, the Solidarity Day coordinator, called<br />\nthe march \"beautiful and inspiring\" and attributed much of the<br />\nsuccess to Baltimore's participation. A unified voice of protest<br />\ntold Reagan and his supporters,<br />\n\"We don't want any cuts,\" she<br />\nsaid.<br />\nThompson opted for street<br />\ndemonstrations over the ballot<br />\nbox as a means of political<br />\nprotest. She said the opposition<br /><br />\ncannot afford to wait for the<br />\n1982 elections to voice its<br />\nopinion. Moreover, she felt that<br />\nthe American political system<br />\nconstituted a \"bipartisan attack<br />\non workers,\" that workers must<br />\nform organizations independent<br />\nof the established parties.<br />\nDorothy Dobby of the<br />\nBaltimore Women's Coalition<br />\nwas the final speaker. She said<br />\nthe new cutbacks in government<br />\nexpenditures will affect women<br />\nmore than any other group. She<br />\nassured Koellein that there<br />\nwould be a large women's<br />\ncontingent at the February rally<br />\nin Annapolis to protest those<br />\ncutbacks and such proposed<br />\nlegislation as the Human Life<br />\nAmendment and the Family<br />\nProtection Act.<br />\nDuring the question and<br />\nanswer session which concluded<br />\nthe program, one audience member asked Koellein why labor<br />\nchooses to ally \u2022 with the Democratic Party rather than establishing its own party. Koellein<br />\nreplied that Marylanders have a<br />\ngood record for voter independence. Referring to his own<br />\nunion, however, he admitted,<br />\n\"Most of our members have<br />\ngone to sleep and our leaders are<br />\ngetting fat bellies.\"<br />\nAnother person in the audience claimed that the trade<br />\nunions do not represent the<br />\nworkers' needs.

Or that it cannot<br />\nbe validly presented in such a<br />\nmanner?<br />\nAnd just how simple is the<br />\n\"simple elegance\" of the<br />\nSchubert?

When<br />\nwe remember that despite all the pleasant<br />\nfrivolity going on among these nobles<br />\nwithin the play, there is a bloody war<br />\ngoing on, the play takes on political<br />\novertones. Indeed, while these nobles get<br />\nvery worked up about their relationships,<br />\nperhaps ultimately it is Much Ado About<br />\nNothing. As the songster Balthazar says<br />\nbefore a song, \"Note this before my<br />\nnotes, there's not a note of mine that's<br />\nworth the noting.\" The play itself confesses to be merely entertaining; like the<br />\nnobles, the playwright is ignoring the war.<br />\n\"Shall I never see a bachelor of<br />\nthreescore again?

Like Hamlet, he<br />\nis ever doubting, ever suspicious, and ever<br />\nprotecting himself from women. Claudio,<br />\na much-honored officer and noble, has<br />\nmindlessly fallen in love with the mindless Hero, and she him, and like the<br />\ndull-witted couple Woody Allen accosts<br />\nin the street in Annie Hall, their relationship is trouble free. To make this couple<br />\ninteresting, Shakespeare gives us the<br />\nvillain Don John, who, for the shabbiest<br />\nof motives, desires to ruin this happy<br /><br />\ncouple. Like lago, Don John uses clever<br />\ndeceptions to convince the gullible<br />\nClaudio that Hero is no hero but a whore.<br />\nTo solve this problem. Shakespeare sends<br />\nin Dogberry, the dim-witted and malaproping defender of justice. Benedict has<br />\ntroubles of his own, because the cast<br />\nmembers, jealous of his apparent wisdom,<br />\npersuade Benedick that Beatrice (the<br />\never-doubting, man-hating mirror image<br />\nof Benedick) has fallen wildly in love<br />\nwith him. He, being of essentially noble<br />\ncharacter, pities the misguided girl, and<br />\nconvinces himself that since he should<br />\nlove Beatrice, he does. Beatrice is similarly missiled by Hero_ and her maids.<br />\nThe witty exchanges between<br />\nBeatrice and Benedick are the high point<br />\nof the show. Their courtship, like two<br />\nporcupines trying to embrace, is amusing<br />\nand brings to the fore all our doubts<br />\nabout relationships.

I<br />\nhave read the book three times now,and my opinion of it<br />\nhas not altered;for me it represents not only a tribute to<br />\nthe author's perception of the world and of human nature, but also a compelling and entertaining chronicle of<br />\nthe activities of a group of people \u2014 the Dreamlanders \u2014<br />\nwho possessed the ability to exploit the shocking, silly,<br />\nand mundane aspects of both urban and suburban<br />\n\"acceptable\" conventions. This is not to proclaim that<br />\nthe book is perfect, insofar as its language and consistency are concerned, but just to say that what Waters<br />\nhas written carries no less historical value than, say, the<br />\nworks of Tom Wolfe, and certainly more value than<br />\nanything Arnold Toynbee ever puked up onto the page.<br />\nOn the other hand, Shock Value is hardly straight<br />\nhistory; it is overtly set up as autobiography, while at<br />\nthe same time it educates a generally uninformed public<br />\nabout those few who couldn't have cared less about the<br />\nBeatles, Berkeley,or Woodstock.<br /><br />\n\"I'm hardly what you'd<br />\ncall a mellow person.\"<br />\nfrom Chapter 2<br />\n\"Why I Love Violence\"<br /><br />\nShock Value, in justifying its title, could<br />\nnever have been written<br />\nas a chronicled autobiography, beginning with<br />\nWater's childhood in Lutherville, a suburb north of<br />\nBaltimore City. The first chapter, titled \"The Filthiest<br />\nPeople Alive,\" allows the reader to be introduced to<br />\nWaters' philosophy in print by the same method a fair<br />\nnumber of people have been introduced to it in his films<br />\n\u2014 that is, by describing in detail the circumstances<br />\nbehind, and the making of,Pink Flamingos.<br /><br />\nWaters' intent, both in writing the<br />\nbook and making his films, appears<br />\nnot to arise out of a desire to record<br />\nhis life within his characters;<br />\nrather, after reading the book,<br />\nseeing the films, and discussing the subject with him, I<br />\nam firmly convinced that his chief purposes are to express his personal tastes and to make people laugh at his<br />\nworks. This, of course, is something he freely admits but<br />\nhas a difficult time conveying to his film audiences; in<br />\nother words, people who might assume that Waters's<br />\nproducts constitute \"art\" films or that they reflect his<br />\npersonal lifestyle are, in the director's opinion, totally<br />\nmisreading him. I bring up this point because, in the<br /><br />\nGOOD BAD TASTE<br /><br />\nBAD BAD TASTE<br />\nNoteworthy incidents from the author's delinquent<br />\nyouth are scattered throughout the book, and the final<br />\n\u2022 chapter (\"Do You Have Parents?\") discusses how Mr.<br />\nand Mrs. Waters put up with, moreover supported, his<br />\nearly filmmaking efforts. Thus, in place of a formal<br />\nintroduction, rather than slowly building up to the point<br />\nwhere the reader might well expect and be prepared<br />\nfor the subject of Pink Flamingos, Waters puts it right up<br />\nfront where it appears most conspicuous. In subsequent<br />\nchapters, at least for most of the book, he alternates<br />\nbetween stating the many-faceted contents of his ideology and the personal experiences which led him to book, Waters goes out of his way to assure the reader<br />\ndevelop self-asserted deviant attitudes.<br />\nthat he is not now, nor has he ever been, the demented<br />\nlunatic people make him out to be.

For Waters, contrarily, nothing in New York \u2014 or anywhere else for that<br />\nmatter \u2014 comes even close to providing him with the<br />\nsort of material he requires to formulate the stories<br />\nwhich eventually find their way into his films. He devotes an entire chapter of Shock Value to the purpose of<br />\nintroducing the uninitiated to Baltimore sleaze. By far<br />\n,the most entertaining portion of the chapter is the part<br />\ndescribing Belair Road \u2014 \"the best 'hair-don't' area in<br />\nBaltimore\" \u2014 but in fact, all of the paragraphs devoted<br />\nto the hairdo phenomenon in this city will undoubtedly<br />\ncause eczema scales on even the most fashion-conscious<br />\nof New Yorkers. For example: \"Eastern Avenue is<br />\nanother fertile spot for watching hairdos, and you can<br />\nusually see women struggling to fit their huge heads<br />\ninto their cars as the wind blows old newspapers and garbage up against them.\"<br /><br />\nN-L: And you really thought it was necessary to state<br />\nthat outright in the book?<br />\nWaters: Well yes!

I go<br />\nto colleges and they say, \"Do you still live in the trailer?\" I mean, some people believe those movies, which is<br />\nflattering, but it's sort of scary; you should see the mail I<br />\nget. Especially since this book has come out, I've gotten<br />\nweirder mail than I've ever gotten from the movies \u2014<br />\npeople saying \"I quit my job after I read your book<br />\ntoday, and I'm either going to make a movie or kill<br />\nsomebody; and if I kill somebody I'm going to kill more<br />\nthan one because it's more economical media-wise, and<br />\nI'll save you a front seat at my trial.\" That was one letter<br />\nI got this week.

For, him, the act<br />\nof parodying silly and sensational behavior is an example<br />\nof good bad taste. Bad bad taste would constitute, say, a<br />\nfilm whose purpose it was merely to show people getting<br />\ndecapitated and otherwise hacked up \u2014 devoid of<br />\nany humor, stylishness, or imagination. I believe that<br />\nWaters is essentially correct in forming a dichotomy<br />\nbetween the two, that his assertions concerning the basis<br />\nof good entertainment have been proven to be true ovei<br />\nthe years, whether they manifest themselves in the form<br />\nof movies, plays, books, or songs. For this reason it is<br />\nnot surprising, for instance, that Waters claims that he<br />\nstopped listening to new music at about the same time<br />\nthe Beatles started becoming popular; socially redeeming<br />\nart formc have no place in his conception of style.<br /><br />\nShould Waters' fans and readers of Shock Value be<br />\ndisappointed that the man does not live like the characters in his films? I think not. We are all aware that there<br />\nexist, and have always existed, real people who behave<br />\nlike the people he portrays, somewhere in the world, or<br />\nin Baltimore at least. Those who feel betrayed by John<br />\nWaters's sensibilities, as related in the book, must realize<br />\nthat if he actually did live like his films' characters, it is<br />\nunlikely that he ever would have been able to distance<br />\nhimself from his own sleaziness enough to write about<br />\nit.<br /><br />\nWhen interviewing Waters, I was particularly<br />\ninterested in his recent views in regard to what Baltimore<br />\nis becoming, what with the large amount of money that<br />\nhas been pouring into the city in the past few years, and<br />\nhow he felt about his own living situation here, at this<br />\ntime:<br />\nN-L: About this city, besides the obvious things, such as<br />\nthe building up of the harbor area\u2014<br />\nWaters: Well (laughs) I'm not exactly part of that.<br />\nN-L: I'm interested in what you think about the \"gentrification\" of the city, whether it might produced a new<br />\nand interesting \"element.\"<br />\nWaters: Oh, it just makes the rents go up and more<br />\nliberals from Washington will move near me; and you<br />\ncan always tell the first sign \u2014 plants in the windows \u2014<br />\nthat you know your rent's going to go up.

Originally designed to be<br />\ncalled Discipline, after a tour under that<br />\nname in England they came back as King<br />\nCrimson. Apparently they realized that<br />\nthe music they play incorporates many of<br />\nthe same sounds and concepts that<br />\nKing Crimson originally had, and that<br />\nthey were unavoidably becoming another<br />\nKing Crimson. Also the name of the<br />\nband provides a convenient backdrop of<br />\nfamiliarity that helps gain interest and<br />\npublicity for them when they would<br />\notherwise be rather obscure.<br />\nThe band's goal seems to be to<br />\nplay music that is different from anything<br />\never played before, yet when listening it's<br />\neasy to pick out familiar sounds that the<br />\nvarious members played when working on<br />\nother projects. The result is that the<br />\nsound of the band is like a culmination of<br />\nthe styles which the four musicians<br />\ndeveloped individually over the years. In<br />\nthe song \"Thela Hun Ginjeet\" the combination of Bruford's rhythmic, Africaninfluenced percussion with the chanting<br />\nvocals of Belew and searing guitar of<br />\nFripp is very similar to the sound pioneered by Talking Heads mastermind<br />\nDavid Byrne and synthesizer genius<br />\nBrian Eno, by whom Belew and Fripp<br />\nThe<br />\nhave been heavily influenced.<br />\ninstrumental \"The Sheltering Sky\"<br />\nhas an ambience that sounds very much<br />\nlike Eno-Fripp collaborations, yet the<br />\npowerful duets between Fripp and Belew,<br />\ncombined with the simple percussion of<br />\nBruford and Levin's steady rhythms on<br /><br />\nthe Garrett Room in the MSE Library.<br />\nThe Kyrios Dancers will discuss and<br />\ndemonstrate dance as a form of prayer,<br />\nthe origins of dance and its use in bringing man closer to his god.

The<br />\ntitle track of the album sounds very much<br />\nlike the music of Fripp's League of Gentlemen project in the style of its progressions, yet it has a much more interesting<br />\nflavor. This is the tone of the whole album, for we hear things that have been<br />\nhinted at before, yet never before combined into this sort of sound.<br />\nAt the concert at Painters Mill on<br />\nNov. 4 I was prepared to hear a very<br />\ndifferent type of sound live than on the<br />\nalbum, because I didn't think Crimson<br />\ncould reproduce the \"studio\" effects of<br />\nthe album live, yet the group added even<br />\nmore interesting sounds when they were<br />\nplaying live. Each musician was getting an<br />\nincredibly varied amount of sounds from<br />\nhis instruments, and in such a casual way<br />\nthat the enthusiastic audience was in awe<br />\nof their talents. Although the group<br />\nplayed all of their new album, King<br />\nCrimson also played from the last two of<br />\nits albums, Red and Lark's Tongue in<br />\nAspic, which sent the hardcore Crimson<br />\nfans wild. They also played some of their<br />\nunreleased material, which sounds promising and is something to look forward to<br />\non a future album.<br />\nIn this age of \"dead-end\" music,\"<br />\nwhere the common consensus seems to be<br />\nthat there isn't anything left to play, King<br />\nCrimson shows us that we don't have to<br />\nrevive old styles of music in desperation<br />\nfor an interesting new sound, and the<br />\ngroup provides a refreshing new outlook<br />\nfor future music.<br /><br />\nIM<br /><br />\nMB lin<br /><br />\n(AS LOW AS 500) PLUS<br />\n\u2022 SPECIAL PRIZES AND GIVEAWAYS<br />\nFor the benefit of the<br />\nI<br />\nJohns Hopkins Tutorial Project<br />\nI<br />\nFRIDAY, NOV-13, 11:00 AM to 8:00 PM<br />\nGlass Pavilion,Johns Hopkins University<br />\nHomewood Campus<br />\ndonated up to the time of<br />\nContributions of recordings and equipment may be<br />\nChaplain at 338-8188<br />\nthe<br />\nof<br />\nOffice<br />\nthe sale.

On the<br />\nensuing possession by the<br />\nColonels, the defense held them<br />\nto nothing on their first play,<br />\nbut then on second and ten. Jeff<br />\nKendall got called for pass<br />\ninterference on his own 48-yard<br />\nline, and that seemed to ignite<br />\nthe offense. Seven plays later<br />\nfullback Bob Hessling ran a<br />\nfourth down, 19-yard pass into<br />\nthe end zone, giving Wilkes the<br />\nlead with 9:08 to go in the first<br />\nquarter.

Included in this<br />\nrecord is the 1980 team, which,<br />\nfinished second to Gettysburg<br />\nCollege and participated in<br />\nA1AW Division III nationals.<br />\nHowever, the 1981 season is<br />\nfull of questions. Many swimmers graduated last year, including Gale Berkowitz and Monica<br />\nBay. Welsh has more swimmers<br />\nthis year than ever before, but<br />\nthey are also more inexperienced. Even though the team<br />\nwill be stronger in diving than it<br />\nhas ever been, it is not very<br />\nversatile yet, and there will be<br />\nsome holes in the lineup.<br />\nIt is a very young team,<br />\nincluding only two seniors and<br />\nmany freshmen and sophomores.<br />\nThe future looks very good, as<br />\nthe team will benefit from this<br />\nyear's improvements during the<br />\nnext few seasons.<br />\nThe Jays are led this year by<br />\nco-captains Anne Aronowitz and<br />\nTracey Smith.

Lisa<br />\nTurbessi is a freshman who also<br />\nshows a lot of promise. Welsh<br />\nwill be depending on these<br />\npeople to do most of the scoring<br />\nduring the season.<br />\nLast Saturday, Oct. 31, the<br /><br />\nteam participated at the MAC<br />\nRelay meet, the first time it has<br />\never been held. It had a scrimmage format, with no scoring.<br />\nHowever, according to Welsh,<br />\nthe team performed well and<br />\nlooked sharp.<br />\nThe Blue Jays will compete<br />\ntoday in the \"Comfort Classic,\"<br />\nan intersquad meet which traditionally starts the season. On<br />\nNov. 19 the Jays will host<br />\nDickinson, a much improved<br />\nteam which the coach believes<br />\nwill be a good test for his young<br />\nsquad. Hopkins' own rivals,<br />\nGettysburg, will be coming to<br />\nHomewood Dec. 2. Defending<br />\nMAC champion Gettysburg will<br />\nbe very hard to beat, having its<br />\nfastest team ever this year.<br />\nWelsh points to the team's<br />\nhard work, as it has been practicing in water for more than a<br />\nmonth. Changes have been made<br />\nin the training program, and so<br />\nfar the swimmers look good and<br />\nare optimistic. But is a young<br />\nand inexperienced team, with its<br />\nleaders being strong and fast<br />\nbut not numerous.
