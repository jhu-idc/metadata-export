He pointed out<br />\nthat the much vaunted undergraduate freedoms had been<br />\ngranted by the administration<br />\n<br />\nand, if students didn't show \"responsibility,\" the administration<br />\ncould take them away. \"The<br />\nuniversity,\" said Dean Shaffer,<br />\ngave the students freedom \"as<br />\na father does,\" and \"like a father\" it can take them away. \"You<br />\ndon't have any freedom,\" stated<br />\nthe dean, \"unless you take responsibility to hold it.\" He<br />\npointed out that it was not the<br />\nintent of the deans to take away<br />\nfreedoms. What is required, he<br />\nsaid, is that the \"house be put<br />\nin order\" under the system<br />\nwhich now exists.<br />\n<br />\nThe Johns Hopkins chapter of Phi Beta Kappa<br />\nannounced this week the election of eight<br />\ngraduate students and thirty-two undergraduate<br />\nstudents to its ranks.

They are to enforce all dormitory regulations imposed by the dean, the committee of head advisors, and the DSRC. A special orientation course will<br />\nbe held each summer for the period of five weeks to<br />\nacquaint the advisors with the some 1000 regulations now<br />\nin effect. The Committee on Undergraduate Affairs has<br />\napproved of all of these regulations and has stated unequivocably that they insure the continuance of the Hopkins' freedoms under the Gentlemen's Code.<br />\nThe orientation period for freshmen will be lengthened this year from four to six weeks to make sure that<br />\nall incoming students successfully adjust to their new<br />\nway of life as responsible citizens. Trained psychiatrists<br />\nwill staff a temporary clinic 24 hours a day. Any freshmen with severe problems may seek free advic. Specialists will he available for consultation with students who<br />\nwant to he tucked in every night, who require too many<br />\ndiaper changes, or who refuse to go to sleep unless their<br />\nmothers kiss them goodnight.<br />\nThe administration will conduct special orientation<br />\nprograms in the following subjects: the use and abuse<br />\nof the evils of smoking and drinking, temperence, and<br />\nthe expression of quiet disapproval through snapping<br />\nfingers.<br />\nDuring the first week of school every freshman<br />\nwill be assigned to a table in the dining hall.

They brought up four dormitory residents on<br />\n\"charges\" of \"violations\". If printed here these violations would show what a frivolous and ludicrous organization the DSRC is. Either the members of the DSRC<br />\nare completely mailable by the deans, or they are so<br />\nenamoured with their \"power\" that they must find every<br />\nexcuse to use it.<br />\nWe have no quarrel with the discouragement of the<br />\nuse of fireworks among these crowds. However the remaining four \"violations\" are utterly ludicrous and from<br />\nour point of view render the DSRC a laughing stock. If<br />\nthis is how the DSRC interprets the Genlemen's Code, we<br />\nwonder what is left of that lofty ideal of behaviour.<br />\nEven more improbable than the \"charges\" put forth<br />\n(if that's possible) are the penalties meted out for such<br />\n\"grave\" violations. Really, what place does social probation have on a men's campus? If misconduct has taken<br />\nplace, then the individual involved should be made aware<br />\nof it politely. Thereafter should such misconduct reoccur he would he subject to much severer and effective<br />\npunishment. When will the DSRC members realize that<br />\nthey have graduated from high school?<br />\n<br />\nHOMEWOOD, BALTIMORE, APRIL 13, 1962<br />\n<br />\nToilet Paper, Beer, Juicy Stories<br />\nLiven Dull Lunch At Levering Hall<br />\nLast week, Abel A. Caplan was<br />\nworking on toilet paper, this<br />\nweek he \"did the cigarette bit\",<br />\nand next week, it could be razor<br />\nblades, beer, or Joe Levine. Abel<br />\nA. Caplan is a professional interviewer, who also manages a<br />\nmovie house. He turned up at<br />\nHopkins this week just as the<br />\nsupply of new and interesting<br />\npeople to interview was running<br />\nout.<br />\nMr. Caplan ventured onto the<br />\ncampus after recent expeditions<br />\nto the University of Delaware<br />\nand Mount Saint Mary's College,<br />\nwhere he was working on a market research study of college<br />\nsmoking habits. His employers<br />\nare the Crossley, S-D Survey<br />\npeople in New York.<br />\nLooking at the interview from<br />\nthe opposite side, Mr. Caplan admitted that \"I hate cigarettes.<br />\nIt's a psychological thing\u2014when<br />\nI was ten years old, I was offered<br />\na cigarette and I wanted to seem<br />\nlike one of the boys. But I had a<br />\nbad case of asthma . . .didn't<br />\n<br />\nbreathe for five minutes . . .<br />\nNever smoked again 'til I was<br />\ntwenty-five.\"<br />\nThe toilet paper assignment<br />\nwas not as tough as it would<br />\nseem, since some embarrassment<br />\nwas eliminated by only interviewing males. Mr. Caplan merely inquired as to the texture of<br />\nthe product, not requiring any<br />\nparticular descriptions from the<br />\nsubjects. But the beer interviews<br />\nwere considerably more difficult,<br />\ntaking an hour or more just to<br />\nrecord the subjeci,s description<br />\nof the flavor of an unmarked<br />\nbeer.<br />\nMadison Avenue's emissary in<br />\nBaltimore commented critically<br />\non the Hopkins atmosphere.<br />\nCompared to Moult Saint Mary's<br />\nor the Univerrity of Delaware,<br />\nHopkins is \"too commercial . . .<br />\nEveryone is in a rush, however,<br />\nthey haven't been rude.\"<br />\nAbel A. Caplan can recall a<br />\nlong history of doors slammed in<br />\nhis face, but the most amusing<br />\nof his printable experiences oc-<br />\n<br />\nPro Arte<br />\n<br />\nEcstasy At Shriver<br />\nBy JOSEPH ROSENBLATT<br />\nOn Sunday night the Ceylon<br />\nNational Dancers performed before an appreciative audience in<br />\nShriver Hall. They displayed a<br />\nhigh degree of sophistication and<br />\nvirtuosity in their renditions of<br />\nSinhalese folk, ritual, and court<br />\ndances.<br />\nAccording to the narrator of<br />\nthe program, who was also the<br />\ntroupe's director, Mr. T. P.<br />\nCeylonese<br />\nthe<br />\nAmerasinghe,<br />\ndances go back over 2,000 years<br />\nand have their origins in the ancient temples and courts of the<br />\nSinhalese kings.<br />\nThe dance forms native to<br />\nCeylon differ from those native<br />\nto India in several ways. While<br />\nthe Indians use the sitar and the<br />\ntamboura as a musical accompaniment, the Ceylonese rely entirely on drums and cymbles.<br />\nSince the drum is the main instrument in their music, harmony and melody are unimportant and only limited use is<br />\nmade of counterpoint. Ceylonese<br />\ndancing is characterized by<br />\nbroad, wide-sweeping arm movements while the Indians depend<br />\nheavily on the actions of the<br />\nhands and eyes.<br />\nTwo Patterns<br />\nIn Sunday night's performance two dance patterns were<br />\ndisplayed, the Kandyan dances<br />\nof central Ceylon and the Vesmultane masked dances of southern Ceylon. In the former the<br />\nsoft-toned Gatabere drum was<br />\nused and in the Vesmultane<br />\ndances the deeper Yeakbera<br />\ndrums were used as an accompaniment. Both of these instruments resemble the bongo drum.<br />\nThe Kandyan dances dealt<br />\nwith themes derived from court<br />\nlife, imitations of animal life,<br />\nand harvest scenes. Of these the<br />\nmost spectacular dances were the<br />\nBera Tharangaya which was a<br />\nfolk-dance describing the beauty<br />\nof the movements of the cobra<br />\nand the Sammanala Vannanta<br />\nwhich portrayed the life of the<br />\nbutterfly and that animal's final<br />\ndestruction at the feet of the<br />\nLord Buddha on Adam's Peak.<br />\nIn both of these dances an amazing amount of skill, which could<br />\nonly have come with years of<br />\ntraining was displayed.<br />\nGrotesque Gestures<br />\nThe Vesmultane dances all derive their themes from the folk<br />\nanimism of the South Ceylonese<br />\nand they are typified by long<br />\ngrotesque gestures on the part<br />\nof the performers. The first offering in this category was the<br />\nSalu Paliya, which the narrator<br />\ndescribed as a \"2,000 year old<br />\nremedy to drive away the blues.\"<br />\n<br />\ncurred when he was crew leader<br />\nof a market research team. One<br />\nof his female assistants knocked<br />\non a door at the end of a long<br />\nand dark hallway. Greeted by a<br />\ngentleman in an extreme state<br />\nof undress, she staggered backward and bumped into the door<br />\nof the apartment across the hall,<br />\nHere she was confronted by a<br />\nlittle old lady, who sized up the<br />\nsituation immediately and<br />\npushed the interviewer into a<br />\nrealty vibrating chair. \"It's just<br />\nwhat you need, dearie.\" (At this<br />\npoint, Mr. Caplan goes into an<br />\nextended pantomime of his heroine's behavior in vibration.)<br />\nThe other life of Abel A. Cap-.<br />\nIan is that of a suburban movie<br />\nmanager, and the price of this<br />\ninterview was an appropriate<br />\nplug, so here it is: Abel A. Caplan invites you and your friends<br />\nto visit his theatre in Catonsville,<br />\nThe Westway, which is new<br />\nfeaturing \"King of Kings'. Mr,<br />\nCaplan will generously provide<br />\nbus transportation for a grout: A<br />\n60 people to and from the move,<br />\nbringing the total price of a<br />\nnight at the flicks to $1.25. So. if<br />\nyou've got 59 friends and $1.25,<br />\ncall Abel A. Caplan at WI 5-9659<br />\n\u2014and see what he can do lor<br />\nyou.<br />\nIn the movie game, Abel A.<br />\nCaplan sees Joseph L. Levine, the<br />\n49 year old producer, as the man<br />\nof the hour. With a reverence<br />\nDavey<br />\nfor<br />\nreserved<br />\nusually<br />\nCrockett or John Glenn, the<br />\nCatonsville Movie Magnat recalls<br />\nthe triumphs of the fabled Mr.<br />\nLevine: \"He grabbed a hold of<br />\n'Hercules' for $50,000 . . . fabulous showman . . . spent $1,000,000 for advertising and made a<br />\n(Continued on Page 5)<br />\n<br />\nEven more spectacular than<br />\nthis was a file-dance that was<br />\noriginally used to drive away<br />\nthe devils.<br />\nFinale<br />\nThe finale to the program was<br />\nthe Khomba Kankariya or Ves<br />\nNatuma which was described as<br />\nthe \"supreme mystery-ritual\".<br />\nThis dance is used today by the<br />\nVes dancer in his initiation ceremony. As the last item of the<br />\nshow it was a display of even<br />\ngreater virtuosity than anything<br />\nwhich had preceded it.

It purports to dramatize<br />\n\"the battle of the generations<br />\n. . . through the magnifying<br />\nglass of a unique historical<br />\nevent,\" namely the conflict of<br />\npersonality and ideology between<br />\nthe heir to the German throne<br />\nand his English wife, on the one<br />\nhand, and their son, the future<br />\nKaiser Wilhelm II, on the other.<br />\nIt takes place sometime in the<br />\nlate 1880's. Judging from this<br />\nplay, Miss Rossi is not a very<br />\ngood playwright.<br />\nBest Parts<br />\nThe acting the other evening<br />\nwas all that the play deserved<br />\nbut no more. The best parts\u2014<br />\nand credit for bringing the play<br />\noff as well as they did\u2014goes to<br />\nthe ladies. Vivienne Shub, as the<br />\nCrown Princess, and Barbara<br />\nCelmer, as her daughter, Moretta, oscillated between wild joy<br />\nand frantic despair for three<br />\nacts, but they were pretty and<br />\nvivacious. The male leads, Robert<br />\nWalsh, as the Crown Prince,<br />\nGeorge Edmonds, as Wilhelm II,<br />\nand Bruce Brown, as the fiance<br />\nof Moretta, did little more than<br />\n<br />\nstand straight in their R.O.T.C.<br />\nuniforms. Harry Welker and<br />\nLothar von Saleski were perhaps the best of an uninspired<br />\nsupporting cast.<br />\n'Nice' Cast<br />\nI feel badly about making the<br />\nabove remarks about a cast that<br />\nwas composed of such obviously<br />\nnice people. As a matter of fact,<br />\nthe whole evening was so very<br />\nnice, so very earnest and wholesome that, after a couple acts,<br />\nit was embarrassing when the<br />\nscript called for a \"damn\" or a<br />\n\"hell.\" If My Father's Mantle<br />\nhad been presented in some community center in Towson, for<br />\nthe benefit of the P.T.A., I<br />\nwouldn't have had the heart to<br />\ncriticize it on any account. The<br />\nunfortunate fact, however, is<br />\nthat it was produced on the<br />\ngrounds of the best-known university of one of America's largest<br />\ncities. If the Johns Hopkins Playshop and the other dramatic organizations that use the facilities<br />\nof the Barn would remember this<br />\nfact, there might be less excuse<br />\nfor this kind of wrist-slapping.<br />\nMy Father's Mantle will be<br />\nperformed again tonight, tomorrow and Sunday, at, 8:30, in the<br />\nBarn.<br />\n<br />\n\fUNDERGRADUATE STUDENTS<br />\na<br />\nl<br />\n<br />\n-<br />\n<br />\n-<br />\n<br />\n- AR<br />\n\u2022.<br />\n<br />\nGRADUATE STUDENTS and FACULTY MEMBERS<br />\n<br />\nPRIVATE CAMPS<br />\nTHE ASSOCIATION OFBoys,<br />\nGirls, Brother-Sister<br />\nding<br />\noutstan<br />\n350<br />\ning<br />\ncompris<br />\n...<br />\nlocated throughout the Now England, Midand Co-Ed Camps,<br />\ndle Atlantic States and Canada.<br />\nent as Head<br />\n...INVITES YOUR INQUIRIES concerning summer employmrs.<br />\nCounselors.

He pointed out<br />\nthat the much vaunted undergraduate freedoms had been<br />\ngranted by the administration<br /><br />\nand, if students didn't show \"responsibility,\" the administration<br />\ncould take them away. \"The<br />\nuniversity,\" said Dean Shaffer,<br />\ngave the students freedom \"as<br />\na father does,\" and \"like a father\" it can take them away. \"You<br />\ndon't have any freedom,\" stated<br />\nthe dean, \"unless you take responsibility to hold it.\" He<br />\npointed out that it was not the<br />\nintent of the deans to take away<br />\nfreedoms. What is required, he<br />\nsaid, is that the \"house be put<br />\nin order\" under the system<br />\nwhich now exists.<br /><br />\nThe Johns Hopkins chapter of Phi Beta Kappa<br />\nannounced this week the election of eight<br />\ngraduate students and thirty-two undergraduate<br />\nstudents to its ranks.

The effortless manner in<br />\nwhich she sings gives the impression of a person singing only<br />\nto herself. She sings with meaning and about things in which<br />\nshe deeply believes.<br />\nMiss Baez usually accompanies<br />\nherself in an accomplished manner on guitar, and laconically<br />\npresents herself before the audience in such a way that,<br />\nthrough the most modest of understatements, she disappears in<br />\norder to let the poetry and melody of the songs take on the<br />\nmantle of importance. Her great<br /><br />\nvocal and instrumental resources<br />\nare matched by the tasteful restraint of her manner, which<br />\nseems to say, \"Listen while I<br />\ntell you a story. . . .\"<br />\nThe current toast of the urban<br />\nfolk-music world, Joan Baez at<br />\nShriver Hall promises to be one<br />\nof the most rewarding evenings<br />\nthat Baltimoreans will experience in many a day.

Caplan was<br />\nworking on toilet paper, this<br />\nweek he \"did the cigarette bit\",<br />\nand next week, it could be razor<br />\nblades, beer, or Joe Levine. Abel<br />\nA. Caplan is a professional interviewer, who also manages a<br />\nmovie house. He turned up at<br />\nHopkins this week just as the<br />\nsupply of new and interesting<br />\npeople to interview was running<br />\nout.<br />\nMr. Caplan ventured onto the<br />\ncampus after recent expeditions<br />\nto the University of Delaware<br />\nand Mount Saint Mary's College,<br />\nwhere he was working on a market research study of college<br />\nsmoking habits. His employers<br />\nare the Crossley, S-D Survey<br />\npeople in New York.<br />\nLooking at the interview from<br />\nthe opposite side, Mr. Caplan admitted that \"I hate cigarettes.<br />\nIt's a psychological thing\u2014when<br />\nI was ten years old, I was offered<br />\na cigarette and I wanted to seem<br />\nlike one of the boys. But I had a<br />\nbad case of asthma . . .didn't<br /><br />\nbreathe for five minutes . . .<br />\nNever smoked again 'til I was<br />\ntwenty-five.\"<br />\nThe toilet paper assignment<br />\nwas not as tough as it would<br />\nseem, since some embarrassment<br />\nwas eliminated by only interviewing males. Mr. Caplan merely inquired as to the texture of<br />\nthe product, not requiring any<br />\nparticular descriptions from the<br />\nsubjects. But the beer interviews<br />\nwere considerably more difficult,<br />\ntaking an hour or more just to<br />\nrecord the subjeci,s description<br />\nof the flavor of an unmarked<br />\nbeer.<br />\nMadison Avenue's emissary in<br />\nBaltimore commented critically<br />\non the Hopkins atmosphere.<br />\nCompared to Moult Saint Mary's<br />\nor the Univerrity of Delaware,<br />\nHopkins is \"too commercial . . .<br />\nEveryone is in a rush, however,<br />\nthey haven't been rude.\"<br />\nAbel A.

They displayed a<br />\nhigh degree of sophistication and<br />\nvirtuosity in their renditions of<br />\nSinhalese folk, ritual, and court<br />\ndances.<br />\nAccording to the narrator of<br />\nthe program, who was also the<br />\ntroupe's director, Mr. T. P.<br />\nCeylonese<br />\nthe<br />\nAmerasinghe,<br />\ndances go back over 2,000 years<br />\nand have their origins in the ancient temples and courts of the<br />\nSinhalese kings.<br />\nThe dance forms native to<br />\nCeylon differ from those native<br />\nto India in several ways. While<br />\nthe Indians use the sitar and the<br />\ntamboura as a musical accompaniment, the Ceylonese rely entirely on drums and cymbles.<br />\nSince the drum is the main instrument in their music, harmony and melody are unimportant and only limited use is<br />\nmade of counterpoint. Ceylonese<br />\ndancing is characterized by<br />\nbroad, wide-sweeping arm movements while the Indians depend<br />\nheavily on the actions of the<br />\nhands and eyes.<br />\nTwo Patterns<br />\nIn Sunday night's performance two dance patterns were<br />\ndisplayed, the Kandyan dances<br />\nof central Ceylon and the Vesmultane masked dances of southern Ceylon. In the former the<br />\nsoft-toned Gatabere drum was<br />\nused and in the Vesmultane<br />\ndances the deeper Yeakbera<br />\ndrums were used as an accompaniment. Both of these instruments resemble the bongo drum.<br />\nThe Kandyan dances dealt<br />\nwith themes derived from court<br />\nlife, imitations of animal life,<br />\nand harvest scenes. Of these the<br />\nmost spectacular dances were the<br />\nBera Tharangaya which was a<br />\nfolk-dance describing the beauty<br />\nof the movements of the cobra<br />\nand the Sammanala Vannanta<br />\nwhich portrayed the life of the<br />\nbutterfly and that animal's final<br />\ndestruction at the feet of the<br />\nLord Buddha on Adam's Peak.<br />\nIn both of these dances an amazing amount of skill, which could<br />\nonly have come with years of<br />\ntraining was displayed.<br />\nGrotesque Gestures<br />\nThe Vesmultane dances all derive their themes from the folk<br />\nanimism of the South Ceylonese<br />\nand they are typified by long<br />\ngrotesque gestures on the part<br />\nof the performers. The first offering in this category was the<br />\nSalu Paliya, which the narrator<br />\ndescribed as a \"2,000 year old<br />\nremedy to drive away the blues.\"<br /><br />\ncurred when he was crew leader<br />\nof a market research team. One<br />\nof his female assistants knocked<br />\non a door at the end of a long<br />\nand dark hallway.
