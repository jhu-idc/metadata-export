What a wonderful place the Hop was.<br />\nThe creatures that lived at the Hop were<br />\nstudents, a strange variety of the species called man. Students took great pleasure in participating in many wonderful activities at the<br />\nHop. They played lacrosse. They did<br />\nresearch. They slept. They played doctor.<br />\nBut what the students liked to do most of<br />\nall was study.<br />\nSo obsessed were the students with studying that they did practically nothing else.<br />\nThey kept strange hours and grew attached<br />\nto the Hut, a room with a very high ceiling<br />\nand pretty windows. Students were also fond<br />\nof Uncle Miltie who had many books, both<br />\nnew and old. One day, Uncle Miltie wanted<br />\nto give some books to the Hut. But the<br />\nstudents who liked the Hut didn't like what<br />\nUncle Miltie wanted to do. So they got mad<br />\nfor the first time in a good while.<br />\nBut the students never cried. They didn't<br />\ncry when their Leader lied to them. She promised that she was going to make them<br />\nhappy. She never did. Students never<br />\nrespected her. They laughed at her.<br />\nBut she stood tall. Or at least she tried.<br />\nSoon other students, with a little less power,<br />\nspoke against her. But she didn't give up.<br />\nShe stood tall once again.<br />\nShe made more and more promises, and<br />\nstudents became more and more unhappy.<br />\nThey didn't like her anymore. And she probably didn't care.<br />\nIt was to be her last year in the kingdom.<br />\nShe sat back in her throne and laughed at<br />\nthe other students. She said to her loyal<br />\nfollowers, \"I can't believe they voted for me.<br />\nThey must be stupid. Why else would they<br />\nhave believed all of my promises? I can't<br />\nbelieve I pulled it off.\"<br />\nAll right. That's enough with her. She'll<br />\nsoon be forgotten.

That's<br />\nhis way to improve the social life at<br />\nHomewood. Unfortunately, too many<br />\nfactors are involved in trying to get an<br />\nexemption: high school students wandering<br />\nonto campus, the risk of visiting students<br />\ndriving back to their colleges, and the<br />\nincreasing possibility of a nationwide drinking<br />\nage of 21.<br />\nAttar must realize that there are other<br />\nways to improve the social life at<br />\nHomewood; serving alcohol is not the only<br />\nsolution.

He<br />\nknows the issues and knows how they should<br />\nbe approached. He realizes that an exemption to the drinking law is not the solution<br />\nand wants to change the programming of<br />\ncampus social events.

Being<br />\ninvolved in all types of athletics<br />\nthroughout most of our lives,<br />\nwe feel that there exists a<br />\nmutual understanding between<br />\nany coach and player. This<br />\nunderstanding involves a level<br />\nof respect both on and off the<br />\nfield regardless of their personal differences. The coach<br />\nand player have but one goal in<br />\nmind and that is to win.<br />\nAlthough we never had the<br />\nopportunity to play under<br />\nCoach Ed Doherty, many of<br />\nour pat coaches have exhibited<br />\nmethods of maintaining mental<br />\nawareness, which in comparison are at least parallel to<br />\nwhat we've witnessed at various<br />\nhome games. There are basically two schools of thought on<br />\nhow to coach a successful team.<br />\nOne method would be to exhibit a passive or controlled attitude on the sideline, which<br />\nmay give way to overblown<br />\negos. Second, the approach<br />\nshown by such collegiate<br />\ncoaches as Bobby Knight,<br />\nWoody Haye, Henry Ciaccarone (who has our undying<br />\nrespect) and Ed Doherty, which<br />\nis a more adamant, demanding<br />\nattitude placed on their players.<br />\nAlthough this coaching technique at times places an overly intensified burden on the players,<br />\nit is still extremely effective.<br />\nThe main point that we are<br />\ntrying to relate is that the letter<br />\nwritten by Nikola Nikic has no<br />\nplace in the News-Letter, and<br />\nrather should be confined between player and coach. It is interesting that Nick's editorial<br />\nappeared one week after his<br />\ncareer had ended. Subsequently, we submit to Nick that to<br />\nmake his view public is a cheap<br />\n<br />\nshot to Coach Doherty, who<br />\nhas proven himself by coaching<br />\nsuccessful teams in the past.<br />\nAlthough Nick is entitled to<br />\nhis own opinion, we feel that an<br />\napology to Coach Doherty is in<br />\norder.<br />\nWillie Odenthal<br />\nRich Glancy<br />\nDave Castle<br />\nFrank De Vita<br />\nGreg Matthews<br />\n<br />\n\"Nappy's Code\"<br />\n<br />\nshould take a good bulk of it.<br />\nHe appeared the blundering<br />\nbumbling fool as a game coach<br />\nan his actual basketball strategy<br />\ndidn't appear very effective<br />\neither.<br />\nNow,I'm not asking for the<br />\nsecond coming of Jim Valvano,<br />\nbut unless Coach Doherty<br />\ndrastically improves his tactics,<br />\nlet's find a coach who can communicate with the team and not<br />\nembarrass the school and the<br />\nplayers.<br />\n<br />\nTo the Editor:<br />\n<br />\nEthan Leder<br />\n<br />\nI am offering my support to<br />\nlast week's \"A Coach and His<br />\nTeam\" by Nikola Nikic. As an<br />\navid follower of the '83-'84<br />\nJays, I feel that Nikic's description of this sorry situation<br />\nseems accurate.<br />\nMy only objection to Nick's<br />\nletter was that it wasn't strong<br />\nenough in emphasizing the<br />\ndegradation and humiliation<br />\nthat the University and the<br />\nplayers are subjected to every<br />\ntime Coach Doherty steps foot<br />\non the court.<br />\nCoach Doherty seems to<br />\nhave alienated all of his players<br />\nthis year by incessant tirades<br />\nand inaudible speech. Even if<br />\nhis intentions were good, it<br />\nmust have been a huge strain on<br />\nthe players to play basketball<br />\nand decipher \"Nappy's Code\"<br />\nat the same time.<br />\nWhile there is such a thing as<br />\neffective emotional coaching,<br />\nCoach Doherty's style certainly doesn't apply, simply<br />\nbecause it cannot really be<br />\nreferred to as \"coaching\". His<br />\nstyle is in one word\u2014pathetic.<br />\nHis whining objections are<br />\nalmost as comical as his<br />\n\"punishment by substitution.\"<br />\nThis is when a player misses a<br />\nsingle shot or makes a single<br />\nturnover and gets pulled out of<br />\nthe game, definitely not a confidence builder.<br />\nFinally, let's face it\u2014 the<br />\n'83-'84 Jays were abundant<br />\nwith raw talent. They should<br />\nhave pulled out a winning<br />\nseason this year. While the<br />\ncoach shouldn't take all the<br />\nblame for the outcome, he<br />\n<br />\nGet Your Facts Straight<br />\nTo the Editor:<br />\nWithout getting at all into the<br />\ndispute between Joel Greenwald and Kozo Shimano over<br />\nthe Olympic Games, I must<br />\npoint out a glaring inaccuracy.<br />\nMr. Shimano states that \"Nazis<br />\nand Communists...are on opposite ends of the political spectrum\", which is absolutely not<br />\ntrue; Nazi stood for National<br />\nSocialist Party, and I do believe<br />\nthat socialism is a left-, not a<br />\nright-wing persuasion.

Obviously, this was sarcasm even on Shimano's<br />\nhumorless level.<br />\nIn addition, Shimano found<br />\nGreenwald's information concerning Sarajevo's unique<br />\ncustom of serving fried egg<br />\nupon pizza as offensive. At this<br />\npoint, one must question<br />\nShimano's right to compare<br />\nthis to eating kosher food.<br />\nEating kosher food is not an<br />\nunusual custom, but rather it is<br />\nJewish.law set forth in the Bible.

The<br />\nengineering mechanics program<br />\nis already accredited, but between now and 1987, the<br />\nDepartment of Mechanics will<br />\nbe renamed the Department of<br />\nMechanical Engineering. This<br />\nchange reflects a shift in the<br />\nresearch and instructional emphasis of the department\u2014<br />\nfrom mechanics to mechanical<br />\nengineering.<br />\nFrom 1913, when Hopkins'<br />\nfirst School of Engineering was<br />\nfounded, to about 1960, there<br />\nwas a strong program in<br />\nmechanical engineering. During<br />\nthe general retrenchment and<br />\nredefining of engineering at<br />\nHopkins in the 1960's, the<br />\nDepartment of Mechanics was<br />\nformed from the faculty of<br />\nseveral departments at<br />\nHomewood. This new department was for a long period of<br />\ntime among the strongest<br />\ndepartments at Hopkins and<br />\nwas a world-renown center for<br />\nengineering mechanics. This<br />\ndepartment, however, gradually shrank through faculty retirement and transfer to other<br />\nuniversities. In 1978, the<br />\nDepartment of Mechanics<br />\ncounted 11 faculty members.<br />\nWith the University's commitment to engineering strengthened, it was decided to reestablish a program in<br />\nmechanical engineering. With<br />\nthe formation of the Whiting<br />\nSchool, some of Mechanic's<br />\nfaculty members went into<br />\nother departments, including<br />\nChemical Engineering and<br />\nMaterial<br />\nand<br />\nScience<br />\nEngineering.<br />\nHopkins was not alone in the<br />\n1960's in its establishment of a<br />\nconsolidated engineering program in mechanics. Many<br />\nwere<br />\nprograms<br />\nsimilar<br />\nestablished throughout the U.S.<br />\nPart bf this, according to Dr.<br />\nWilliam N. Sharpe, chairman<br />\nof the department, is due to the<br />\nnation's response to the \"sputnik phenomenon.\" Then during the late 1970's many departments shifted their emphasis, as<br />\nHopkins is doing, to<br />\nmechanical engineering.<br />\n<br />\nMechanical engineering is a<br />\nbroad field which deals with the<br />\nconversion of energy through<br />\nuseful mechanical devices. Emphasis on the undergraduate<br />\nlevel is therefore thermal<br />\nsystems and mechanical<br />\nsystems. Engineering mechanics<br />\nis an area of study closely<br />\nrelated to mechanical engineering, but with increased emphasis on basic sciences and<br />\nmodern mathematical analysis.<br />\nThe two main components of<br />\nthe undergraduate curriculum<br />\nare solid mechanics and fluid<br />\nmechanics. There is a slightly<br />\ngreater flexibility in mechanics<br />\nwhich permits a student to hold<br />\na special interest.<br />\nBoth programs, engineering<br />\nmechanics and mechanical<br />\nengineering, will be maintained fracture mechanics, the<br />\nwithin the new Department of dynamic behavior of solids,<br />\nMechanical Engineering.

The result is<br />\nwhat you might expect: works<br />\nof varying quality ably staged<br />\nand performed with varying<br />\nskill. The one constant is enthusiasm. An energy crackles<br />\nthrough these productions<br />\nwhich is barely containable on<br />\nthe modest stage of the L/V<br />\nRoom,so naturally, some of it<br />\nleaps out and fires the audience.<br />\nWhich is as good a definition as<br />\nany of theater.<br />\nThe entire production is<br />\nspread over two nights. It<br />\npreviewed this past Tuesday<br />\nand Wednesday, and will be<br />\nand<br />\ntonight<br />\nrepeated<br />\ntomorrow.<br />\nThe first evening's program<br />\nconsists of five short plays<br />\nseparated by two intermissions.<br />\nFirst up is Kevin Sottak's Out<br />\nof Touch, a three-character<br />\nsketch about a college student<br />\nvisiting his senescent grandparents. The play founders a<br />\nlittle on some overblown<br />\nlanguage and has no resolution<br />\nto speak of, but it's buoyed by<br />\ngood work from Rich Bigelow<br />\nas the grandfather.<br />\nSecond is Change of Events<br />\nby Paul Murphy, a startling little blackout piece that gives new<br />\n<br />\nmeaning to the term \"male fantasy.\" John Peng and Mark<br />\nHughes contribute some lovely<br />\nbusiness as drunks in a bar<br />\nwhere the pickup scene can get<br />\npretty intense.<br />\nSermon in Stone, by Bruce<br />\nCohen, follows the first intermission. The author plays<br />\nRussell Jackalow, a high-school<br />\nsenior whose emotional reaction to his father's death three<br />\nyears before is preventing him<br />\nfrom planning his future, and<br />\ntearing him between two<br />\nsubstitute role models: an<br />\nEnglish teacher and a television<br />\ncomedian. The play is very insightful about such matters as<br />\nteacher/pupil relationships,<br />\nparental pride, and adolescent<br />\nidol worship, although again<br />\nthe resolution could use a little<br />\nwork. Deserving particular<br />\npraise here are Jim Sullivan,<br />\nwho (with the help of Cohen's<br />\nflabbergastingly accurate<br />\nmonologues) plays the comedian with just the right mix of<br />\nVegas schmaltz and New York<br />\nhipness; and Katherine Hassler,<br />\nwho, as Russell's mother, has<br />\na wonderful scene in which she<br />\ngives her son a graduation gift.<br />\nAfter another intermission<br />\ncome two plays, both of which<br />\nin their own ways are small<br />\nmarvels. Steve Barthelme's<br />\nClowns is about a couple whose<br />\nprincipal form of communication is the mindfuck, and it<br />\n<br />\ncontains some of the evening's<br />\nfinest writing. The author is<br />\nwise to the ways in which our<br />\nperceptions of others are too<br />\noften warped by our own deficiencies as human beings. The<br />\ncast (Elizabeth Levy, Larry<br />\nMilgrim, Beth Polasky) play<br />\nthe challenging roles in earnest,<br />\nbut maybe a little too earnestly: their occasionally overdramatic readings tend to<br />\ndampen the naturalism of the<br />\ndialogue, and thus of the<br />\nsituation.<br />\nThe first evening concludes<br />\nwith Joanne Hayden Coleman,<br />\n38, Suddenly, by Fae Dremock.<br />\nThis simple piece about a man<br />\nwhose stepsister's suicide drives<br />\nhim to a grief something like<br />\nmadness is a brooding, poetic<br />\nmeditation on life and death,<br />\ngiven shape by some intriguing<br />\nblocking and anchored by the<br />\npowerful performance of Bruce<br />\nMcKenzie.<br />\nThe second night consists of<br />\none full-length production, Inventory, by Jessica Kubzansky.<br />\nHilary Freer is Margaret, a thirtyish antique dealer resigned to<br />\nthe life of a spinster. Her<br />\nbrother (Gregg Heacock), a<br />\nyoung executive, and sister<br />\n(Sam Murray), whose impending marriage forms the central<br />\nconflict of the play, serve as<br />\ncontrast to Margaret's eventless<br />\nexistence. Enter Merwin (Paul<br />\nGarlinghouse), local eccentric,<br />\n<br />\nwho seems to have taken it<br />\nupon himself to bring Margaret<br />\njoy and excitement\u2014neither of<br />\nwhich she seems particularly interested in. Their odd intimacy<br />\ntakes up most of the second<br />\nhalf of the play, creating a<br />\nchance for Margaret to touch<br />\nhappiness. Will she take it?<br />\nFreer is a poignant Margaret,<br />\nparticularly in a scene in which<br />\nit pains her even to look at her<br />\nsister's engagement ring. Garling house is pleasant as Merwin, and strong support is provided by Heacock (especially in<br />\none powerful, alcohol-induced<br />\noutburst) and by Brad Powers<br />\nas Tim, Margaret's cynical yet<br />\ncongenial shopboy.<br />\n<br />\nSpecial mention must be<br />\nmade of the fluid, nimble<br />\nlighting by Dan Press and<br />\nReynerio Muradaz, and the excellent set designs by Ed Fisher,<br />\nwho on the first night does<br />\nwonders with simple geometric<br />\nshapes and on the second turns<br />\nthe stage into a fully stocked<br />\nantique shop.

When I said the words<br />\n\"prep school\" and \"New<br />\nJersey\", Gregory shrugged and<br />\nlooked at me quizzically. What<br />\ndid such things matter? The<br />\nshirt was American, and it fit<br />\nwell.<br />\nAmerican items also fit well<br />\nin his apartment.

In<br />\npolitics, he said what most intrigued him about America was<br />\nthe two-party system. He<br />\nthought that the Communist<br />\nparty, which rules unchallenged and unmotivated, would<br />\nbenefit from the sort of competition American parties face<br />\neach election year.<br />\nThis sounded to me like a<br />\n'just, intelligent observation<br />\nfrom a young Soviet.

His<br />\nbest American friends were a<br />\npair of Dartmouth students<br />\nwho spent a summer in Leningrad two years ago.

Nevertheless,<br />\none evening, as a group of her<br />\nfriends and mine were strolling<br />\naround Leningrad, politics slipped into a conversation that<br />\nwas originally about Soviet art.<br />\nWhat she did say, she said slowly, weighing her words<br />\ncarefully.<br />\n<br />\nBut something had happened<br />\nalong the way to Communism,<br />\nshe said, and the nation had not<br />\nturned out as the revolutionists<br />\nexpected. They had it all worked out, Lenin and his group of<br />\nintellectuals; but they didn't<br />\ntake into account that not<br />\neveryone was as intelligent as<br />\nthey were.<br />\nShe said that young Soviets<br />\nalmost never read Marx or<br />\nLenin, outside of what is<br />\nassigned in class, because their<br />\nideas are far too difficult and<br />\ncomplex.<br />\n\"As it is now,\" Tanya concluded, \"socialism is not much<br />\nbetter than the Capitalism of<br />\nthe West.\"<br />\nNevertheless, Tanya made<br />\nme understand that she was not<br />\nignorant of America's problems. \"America has a terribly<br />\nwide gap between its classes,\"<br />\nshe said. \"You have the very<br />\npoor and the very rich and<br />\nalmost no one in between.

Even Jim McKay would<br />\nhave shown some enthusiasm<br />\nlast weekend when Hopkins<br />\ncaptured the Middle Atlantic<br />\nConference championship title,<br />\none that had eluded them for<br />\nfour years.<br />\nSurprisingly, no one (except,<br />\nof course, the Jays) expected<br />\nthem to do it. Unofficially seeded fourth, the Blue Jays, while<br />\nsporting a 15-15 season record,<br />\nposted only a 2-3 mark within<br />\nthe MAC.<br />\nThe favorites were Haverford, the home school and<br />\ndefending champions, and<br />\nLafayette. Hopkins had lost to<br />\nboth schools during the season.<br />\nBut the Blue Jays had a game<br />\nplan and spent all week drilling<br />\non the ways to beat the key men<br />\nfrom the other schools.<br />\nJubilantly, they carried home<br />\nthe result of their efforts, the<br />\ncoveted Yale Cup.<br />\nWhat pleased the team most<br />\nis that they won the tournament; they didn't back into a<br />\nvictory. Hopkins faced the two<br />\ntop seeds in the first two<br />\nrounds. The Blue Jays then<br />\nproceeded to take eight of<br />\ntwelve bouts from the favorites,<br />\ngiving them a lead they relinquished only momentarily during the entire tournament.<br />\nOtherwise, the day was all<br />\nHopkins. The team took first<br />\nplace by a comfortable six bout<br />\nmargin over Lafayette College,<br />\n38-32. Stevens Tech followed in<br />\nthird place.<br />\nThe dual meet season, where<br />\nthe team met schools on a oneto-one basis, was a series of ups<br />\nand downs. Of the team's six<br />\n<br />\nstarters at the championship,<br />\ncoach Richard Oles could only<br />\nbe sure of the performances of<br />\nthree. Of the others, he could<br />\nonly hope.<br />\nFortunately, things fell into<br />\nplace for the team and everyone<br />\nhad a great day, putting<br />\ntogether the right combination<br />\nof tactics and moves to carry<br />\nthe team to victory. The squad<br />\ndominated psychologically, as<br />\nwell as physically, outlasting<br />\nthe other schools.<br />\nSpecifically, each of the<br />\nweapons made a better contribution than was expected.<br />\nThe epee team finished fifth,<br />\nthe sabre team surprisingly captured second place, and foil,<br />\nwhile expecting to put in a<br />\nstrong bid for the title, finished first, losing only two bouts<br />\nall day.<br />\nFor epee, Tim Cook was<br />\neven at five and five, showing<br />\na much improved performance<br />\nfrom last year's MAC's. Cook,<br />\nwho is quite tall, used his height<br />\nand reach effectively in this tall<br />\nman's weapon.<br />\nCaptain Pat Havens, starting<br />\nin his first MAC, faced all the<br />\ntop seeds early and, although<br />\nmaintaining a competitive<br />\nshowing, found himself at the<br />\nshort end of his four contests.<br />\nAlex Moen, a sophomore with<br />\nlimited experience this season,<br />\nreplaced Havens and was three<br />\nand three, winning three more<br />\nthan anyone expected.<br />\nThe sabre squad, which had<br />\nbeen frustratingly close to solid<br />\nall season, finally fell into a<br />\ngroove and captured the silver.<br />\nWales<br />\nShao,<br />\nanother<br />\nsophomore in his rookie<br />\nseason, beat many of the top<br />\nseeds and ended with a five and<br />\nfive record.<br />\nCaptain Taro Adachi, who<br />\n<br />\nhad a superlative season, was<br />\nseven and three. Finishing<br />\nfourth in the sabre, Adachi was<br />\none win short of a second place<br />\nfinish and an NCAA berth.<br />\nAdachi is hungry for next<br />\nseason when he figures to have<br />\nhis best year ever.<br />\nAndy Goldberg and Captain<br />\nDavid Wiener, who combined<br />\nfor 83 wins against only 15<br />\nlosses during the regular<br />\nseason, totally dominated the<br />\nfoil event, winning 18 out of 20<br />\nbouts. Goldberg, only a<br />\nsophomore, capped a brilliant<br />\nseason, where he lost only 4<br />\ntimes, by winning the foil with<br />\na 10-0 record. With only a few<br />\nshaky moments, like a 5-4 win<br />\nafter being down 4-1 against<br />\nyear's<br />\nchampion,<br />\nlast<br />\nGoldberg's dazzling display of<br />\ndexterity gave him first place.<br />\nWiener, a senior, took second place with an 8-2 mark,<br />\nlosing only to the Haverford<br />\nfencers. Wiener, who went to<br />\nthe NCAA's in his freshman<br />\nyear, failed to qualify the next<br />\ntwo seasons. But this year, he<br />\nand Goldberg secured the two<br />\nfoil berths from the MAC to<br />\nthis year's National Championship at Princeton.<br />\nAt the tournament, Hopkins<br />\nwas by far the most enthusiastic<br />\nsquad. Even the fencers who<br />\ndidn't get a chance to actually<br />\nfence participated by accumulating scores and keeping<br />\nthe starters abreast of the day's<br />\nevents.<br />\nJim Hoff, a sophomore who<br />\nbroke his finger and could not<br />\neven practice, .came along<br />\nanyway and offered his services<br />\nas the team's \"P.R.5!man. All<br />\nin all, the team effort was<br />\ntremendous, and the Blue Jay's<br />\nsuccess can most certainly be<br />\nattributed to it.<br />\n<br />\nMost proud of all, though,<br />\nwas Coach Oles. Besides the<br />\nteam and foil trophies, Coach<br />\nOles was awarded \"1984 Coach<br />\nof the Year\" by his colleagues.<br />\nAs he stood, surrounded by all<br />\nof his newly acquired \"hard-<br />\n<br />\nware\", the coach summed up<br />\nthe day: \"If I died today, it<br />\nwould take the undertaker a<br />\nmonth to get the grin off my<br />\nface.\"<br />\nOr the trophies out of his<br />\nhands.<br />\n<br />\nStarting From Scratch<br />\nHopkins' fencing is unique<br />\ncompared to most collegiate<br />\nprograms, relying on little or no<br />\nrecruiting. High school fencers<br />\nmust contact the coach first<br />\nbefore any talks can begin.<br />\nAlso, Hopkins awards no<br />\nfinancial incentives to lure top<br />\nlevel prospects.<br />\nAs a result, 90% of Coach<br />\nRichard Oles' freshman squad<br />\nhave never handled a blade outside of the kitchen or biology<br />\nlab. On the other hand, the<br />\nBlue Jays face teams comprised almost totally of fencers with<br />\nhigh school experience.<br />\nBut in their first varsity<br />\nseason, the \"home-growns\"<br />\nmanaged to win half their bouts<br />\nat last weekend's championship<br />\ntourney, enough to push<br />\nHopkins over the top.<br />\nThe bottom line is that<br />\nCoach Oles' methods work.<br />\nOver the twenty-two seasons,<br />\nOles has developed a program<br />\nthat pays particular attention to<br />\ndetail and precision. The fundamentals of the sport are reinforced practice after practice<br />\nwith countless (and endless)<br />\nfootwork and bladework drills.<br />\nThe coach complements this<br />\nwith athletic training that is<br />\nspecifically suited for fencing,<br />\nstressing endurance instead of<br />\nstrength.<br />\nFinally, Oles forces the team<br />\n<br />\nito know and understand all the<br />\nmany complicated rules and<br />\ntheir nuances. The result is an<br />\naura of confidence about the<br />\nfencers, a confidence that<br />\ncomes from knowing even the<br />\nmost subtle intricacies of the<br />\nsport.<br />\nOles, a recognized fencing<br />\nmaestro, offers each of his<br />\nfencers individual lessons.<br />\nThese lessons, about twenty<br />\nminutes in duration, encourage<br />\ntactical thinking as well as the<br />\nperfection of technique. Often,<br />\nthe coach will create bout-like<br />\nsituations, giving new fencers a<br />\nchance to react and move as<br />\nthey would in a real fencing<br />\nmatch; a substitute for the<br />\nmuch-needed experience that is<br />\na prerequisite for consistent<br />\nwinning.<br />\nAnd Oles does produce winners. Over the 30 years since the<br />\nMAC's inception, Hopkins is<br />\nsecond among all schools with<br />\nnine team championships.<br />\nStill, he is already looking<br />\nforward to next year. The present varsity, their competitive<br />\nseason over, is busy at work<br />\nteaching this year's crop of<br />\nfreshmen. After all, they are<br />\nonly second among the MAC<br />\nteams, and for Oles and his<br />\nBlue Jays, that's just not good<br />\nenough.<br />\n<br />\nHair Cutting & Design<br />\nSummer<br />\nLanguage Institute<br />\n<br />\nHumanities, Social Sciences,<br />\nMathematics, and Statistics<br />\n<br />\nJune 18\u2014August io<br />\n<br />\nJune 18\u2014August io<br />\n<br />\nSciences<br />\n<br />\nThe Five-Week Semester<br />\n<br />\nJune +\u2014August 10<br />\n<br />\nJuly 9\u2014August io<br />\n<br />\nYale Summer Programs<br />\n<br />\nFor Men & Women<br />\n<br />\n100 E. 33rd St. 1 BLOCK FROM CAMPUS<br />\nFor Appointment Tues-Sat Call<br />\n235-7083<br />\n10-<br />\n<br />\nYale Summer Programs present<br />\neach year a number of academic<br />\ncourses for credit.<br />\nStudents live in Silliman College\u2014<br />\none of Yale's Residential Colleges<br />\nand participate fully in the various<br />\nacademic, social, and cultural<br />\nactivities that take place during the<br />\nsummer.<br />\n<br />\nResources of the Yale University<br />\nLibrary, Art Gallery, British Art<br />\nCenter, and Peabody Museum of<br />\nNatural History are fully available<br />\nto the summer community.

Or grabbing a danish an hour after<br />\nbreakfast. At the time, you<br />\nthink you need it, but<br />\nsomewhere down the line, you<br />\nmust pay.<br />\nOver-recruiting won't hurt a<br />\ncoach's waistline. But too much<br />\nmaterial has caused more<br />\ncoaches to be fired than<br />\ncoaches getting new contracts.<br />\nThat's because a coach who<br />\nover-recruits, grabs one too<br />\nmany nosebleeders or floor<br />\ngenerals, usually ends up with<br />\na morale problem on his team,<br />\na problem that goes directly<br />\nback to playing time. It's okay<br />\nas long as you're winning, but<br />\nas soon as you stub your toe,<br />\nit's like an albatross around<br />\nyour neck.<br />\nIf a coach wants to make it ,<br />\n\"Uptown\", he must keep harmony on the end of the bench,<br />\nspread the publicity around.<br />\nThe problem is, if a guy plays<br />\n10 minutes and scores 10<br />\n<br />\npoints, he believes if he plays 40<br />\nminutes, he'll score 40 points.<br />\nPlus, the cash is affected by the<br />\nplayer's sphere of influence, his<br />\nparents, his buddies, and his<br />\ngirlfriend. They're the ones<br />\nwho are always patting him on<br />\nthe back, stroking him, saying,<br />\n\"shoot more,\" or \"why don't<br />\nyou play more?\"<br />\nI always thought, as a coach,<br />\nthat I never wanted to go past<br />\nmy seventh man, because when<br />\nyou show your eighth or ninth<br />\nman, you've suddenly got a<br />\nproblem with playing time. See,<br />\nyou must realize, barring overtime, that each player can only<br />\nplay 40 minutes, that there are<br />\nonly 200 possible minutes to a<br />\ngame.

Consequently, he said, much of<br />\nwhat is reported is not and<br />\nshould not be \"good\" or pleasant news.<br />\nKoppel also addressed the<br />\nproblem of television contribution to the poor performance of<br />\nstudents nationally in reading<br />\nand writing, and agreed that<br />\n\"to a certain degree, television<br />\nis responsible for the shortcomings of our nation's youth in<br />\nbasic communication skills.\"<br />\nHe suggested that it is the<br />\nresponsibility of parents to<br />\nwatch over their children and<br />\ntake the initiative in limiting the<br />\namount of time children spend<br />\nwatching TV.<br /><br />\nNEWS-LETTER/3<br /><br />\nCouncil Told of Dorm Space Plans Increase in<br />\nAdult<br />\nStudents<br /><br />\nby Deane Brown<br />\nAssociate Dean of Students<br />\nChris Colombo and Associate<br />\nDean for Administration C.<br />\nNorman Krueger presented<br />\nplans for the renovation of<br />\ncommon space in Alumni<br />\nMemorial Residences I and II<br />\nto the Student Council Wednesday night.<br />\nKrueger said a \"considerable<br />\namount of student input\" went<br />\ninto the plans, which were based on recommendations from a<br />\ncommittee that studied the<br />\nneeds for common space last<br />\nyear.<br />\nKrueger said the interior of<br />\nthe quads surrounding both<br />\nAMR I and II will be landscaped.

Students took great pleasure in participating in many wonderful activities at the<br />\nHop. They played lacrosse. They did<br />\nresearch. They slept. They played doctor.<br />\nBut what the students liked to do most of<br />\nall was study.<br />\nSo obsessed were the students with studying that they did practically nothing else.<br />\nThey kept strange hours and grew attached<br />\nto the Hut, a room with a very high ceiling<br />\nand pretty windows. Students were also fond<br />\nof Uncle Miltie who had many books, both<br />\nnew and old. One day, Uncle Miltie wanted<br />\nto give some books to the Hut. But the<br />\nstudents who liked the Hut didn't like what<br />\nUncle Miltie wanted to do. So they got mad<br />\nfor the first time in a good while.<br />\nBut the students never cried. They didn't<br />\ncry when their Leader lied to them. She promised that she was going to make them<br />\nhappy. She never did. Students never<br />\nrespected her.

Unfortunately, too many<br />\nfactors are involved in trying to get an<br />\nexemption: high school students wandering<br />\nonto campus, the risk of visiting students<br />\ndriving back to their colleges, and the<br />\nincreasing possibility of a nationwide drinking<br />\nage of 21.<br />\nAttar must realize that there are other<br />\nways to improve the social life at<br />\nHomewood; serving alcohol is not the only<br />\nsolution.

He also promises to bring a<br />\nfresh approach to the position of Leader.<br />\nJon Lana has been involved in student<br />\ngovernment for three years and has all the<br />\nqualifications to be Leader of the Hop. He<br />\nknows the issues and knows how they should<br />\nbe approached. He realizes that an exemption to the drinking law is not the solution<br />\nand wants to change the programming of<br />\ncampus social events. He has served on the<br />\nCommittee on Undergraduate Studies and<br />\nis familiar with its peculiar relationship with<br />\nthe Academic Council. Unfortunately, the<br />\nAcademic Council is the only group on campus that can make changes in academic<br />\npolicies. Thus, the role of CUS must be<br />\nredefined.<br />\nIt's these types of changes that need to be<br />\nmade.

At this time, we<br />\nwould like to offer our views<br />\nand inject some sense into what<br />\nhas become an exercise in<br />\npettiness.<br />\nOur remarks must begin with<br />\nthe instigator of all this trouble:<br />\nThe Hopkins News-Letter. The<br />\nValentine's Day centerfold<br />\nclearly violates the News-Letter<br />\njournalistic standards. This<br />\nfeature article fell short of its<br />\nobvious goals. The problem<br />\nbetween Hopkins men and<br />\nwomen is a worthwhile topic\u2014<br />\nto print insults, replete with<br />\nstreet language simply could<br />\nnot do justice to the issues. The<br />\neditors, in effect, compromised<br />\nthe News-Letter's reputation by<br />\nchoosing profanity over good<br />\ntaste.

I am sure that Goucher<br />\ngirls joke about us on occasion,<br />\ntoo. As long as it remains light<br />\nand verbal, it's no problem; but<br />\nprinting the vulgar comments<br />\nthat appeared in the article was<br />\noverstepping all bounds of taste<br />\nand decency.<br />\nTo all the Goucher girls who<br />\nso rightfully took offense to the<br />\narticle, please realize that the<br />\nmajority of Hopkins girls do<br />\nnot feel this way. It is only one<br />\nor perhaps a few (who but they<br />\nknow for sure) bitter girls who<br />\nstarted the whole scandal.

Being<br />\ninvolved in all types of athletics<br />\nthroughout most of our lives,<br />\nwe feel that there exists a<br />\nmutual understanding between<br />\nany coach and player. This<br />\nunderstanding involves a level<br />\nof respect both on and off the<br />\nfield regardless of their personal differences. The coach<br />\nand player have but one goal in<br />\nmind and that is to win.<br />\nAlthough we never had the<br />\nopportunity to play under<br />\nCoach Ed Doherty, many of<br />\nour pat coaches have exhibited<br />\nmethods of maintaining mental<br />\nawareness, which in comparison are at least parallel to<br />\nwhat we've witnessed at various<br />\nhome games. There are basically two schools of thought on<br />\nhow to coach a successful team.<br />\nOne method would be to exhibit a passive or controlled attitude on the sideline, which<br />\nmay give way to overblown<br />\negos. Second, the approach<br />\nshown by such collegiate<br />\ncoaches as Bobby Knight,<br />\nWoody Haye, Henry Ciaccarone (who has our undying<br />\nrespect) and Ed Doherty, which<br />\nis a more adamant, demanding<br />\nattitude placed on their players.<br />\nAlthough this coaching technique at times places an overly intensified burden on the players,<br />\nit is still extremely effective.<br />\nThe main point that we are<br />\ntrying to relate is that the letter<br />\nwritten by Nikola Nikic has no<br />\nplace in the News-Letter, and<br />\nrather should be confined between player and coach. It is interesting that Nick's editorial<br />\nappeared one week after his<br />\ncareer had ended. Subsequently, we submit to Nick that to<br />\nmake his view public is a cheap<br /><br />\nshot to Coach Doherty, who<br />\nhas proven himself by coaching<br />\nsuccessful teams in the past.<br />\nAlthough Nick is entitled to<br />\nhis own opinion, we feel that an<br />\napology to Coach Doherty is in<br />\norder.<br />\nWillie Odenthal<br />\nRich Glancy<br />\nDave Castle<br />\nFrank De Vita<br />\nGreg Matthews<br /><br />\n\"Nappy's Code\"<br /><br />\nshould take a good bulk of it.<br />\nHe appeared the blundering<br />\nbumbling fool as a game coach<br />\nan his actual basketball strategy<br />\ndidn't appear very effective<br />\neither.<br />\nNow,I'm not asking for the<br />\nsecond coming of Jim Valvano,<br />\nbut unless Coach Doherty<br />\ndrastically improves his tactics,<br />\nlet's find a coach who can communicate with the team and not<br />\nembarrass the school and the<br />\nplayers.<br /><br />\nTo the Editor:<br /><br />\nEthan Leder<br /><br />\nI am offering my support to<br />\nlast week's \"A Coach and His<br />\nTeam\" by Nikola Nikic. As an<br />\navid follower of the '83-'84<br />\nJays, I feel that Nikic's description of this sorry situation<br />\nseems accurate.<br />\nMy only objection to Nick's<br />\nletter was that it wasn't strong<br />\nenough in emphasizing the<br />\ndegradation and humiliation<br />\nthat the University and the<br />\nplayers are subjected to every<br />\ntime Coach Doherty steps foot<br />\non the court.<br />\nCoach Doherty seems to<br />\nhave alienated all of his players<br />\nthis year by incessant tirades<br />\nand inaudible speech. Even if<br />\nhis intentions were good, it<br />\nmust have been a huge strain on<br />\nthe players to play basketball<br />\nand decipher \"Nappy's Code\"<br />\nat the same time.<br />\nWhile there is such a thing as<br />\neffective emotional coaching,<br />\nCoach Doherty's style certainly doesn't apply, simply<br />\nbecause it cannot really be<br />\nreferred to as \"coaching\". His<br />\nstyle is in one word\u2014pathetic.<br />\nHis whining objections are<br />\nalmost as comical as his<br />\n\"punishment by substitution.\"<br />\nThis is when a player misses a<br />\nsingle shot or makes a single<br />\nturnover and gets pulled out of<br />\nthe game, definitely not a confidence builder.<br />\nFinally, let's face it\u2014 the<br />\n'83-'84 Jays were abundant<br />\nwith raw talent.

The<br />\nengineering mechanics program<br />\nis already accredited, but between now and 1987, the<br />\nDepartment of Mechanics will<br />\nbe renamed the Department of<br />\nMechanical Engineering. This<br />\nchange reflects a shift in the<br />\nresearch and instructional emphasis of the department\u2014<br />\nfrom mechanics to mechanical<br />\nengineering.<br />\nFrom 1913, when Hopkins'<br />\nfirst School of Engineering was<br />\nfounded, to about 1960, there<br />\nwas a strong program in<br />\nmechanical engineering. During<br />\nthe general retrenchment and<br />\nredefining of engineering at<br />\nHopkins in the 1960's, the<br />\nDepartment of Mechanics was<br />\nformed from the faculty of<br />\nseveral departments at<br />\nHomewood. This new department was for a long period of<br />\ntime among the strongest<br />\ndepartments at Hopkins and<br />\nwas a world-renown center for<br />\nengineering mechanics. This<br />\ndepartment, however, gradually shrank through faculty retirement and transfer to other<br />\nuniversities. In 1978, the<br />\nDepartment of Mechanics<br />\ncounted 11 faculty members.<br />\nWith the University's commitment to engineering strengthened, it was decided to reestablish a program in<br />\nmechanical engineering. With<br />\nthe formation of the Whiting<br />\nSchool, some of Mechanic's<br />\nfaculty members went into<br />\nother departments, including<br />\nChemical Engineering and<br />\nMaterial<br />\nand<br />\nScience<br />\nEngineering.<br />\nHopkins was not alone in the<br />\n1960's in its establishment of a<br />\nconsolidated engineering program in mechanics. Many<br />\nwere<br />\nprograms<br />\nsimilar<br />\nestablished throughout the U.S.<br />\nPart bf this, according to Dr.<br />\nWilliam N. Sharpe, chairman<br />\nof the department, is due to the<br />\nnation's response to the \"sputnik phenomenon.\" Then during the late 1970's many departments shifted their emphasis, as<br />\nHopkins is doing, to<br />\nmechanical engineering.<br /><br />\nMechanical engineering is a<br />\nbroad field which deals with the<br />\nconversion of energy through<br />\nuseful mechanical devices. Emphasis on the undergraduate<br />\nlevel is therefore thermal<br />\nsystems and mechanical<br />\nsystems. Engineering mechanics<br />\nis an area of study closely<br />\nrelated to mechanical engineering, but with increased emphasis on basic sciences and<br />\nmodern mathematical analysis.<br />\nThe two main components of<br />\nthe undergraduate curriculum<br />\nare solid mechanics and fluid<br />\nmechanics. There is a slightly<br />\ngreater flexibility in mechanics<br />\nwhich permits a student to hold<br />\na special interest.<br />\nBoth programs, engineering<br />\nmechanics and mechanical<br />\nengineering, will be maintained fracture mechanics, the<br />\nwithin the new Department of dynamic behavior of solids,<br />\nMechanical Engineering.

Sharpe feels that this is<br />\nindicative of Hopkins' interest<br />\nin maintaining a strong program in engineering science and<br />\nresearch.<br />\nFrom a present undergraduate enrollment of<br />\n20, the department hopes to<br />\ngrow to 80 or 100 by the end of<br />\nthe decade. Projections also call<br />\nfor a growth in the number of<br />\ngraduate students from eight to<br />\n40 or 50. As Sharpe explains the<br />\ntotal number of student at<br />\nHopkins' School of Engineering will never be that large\u2014<br />\nwhen compared to other<br />\nengineering schools. \"What<br />\ndistinguishes us will be the<br />\nsmaller student to faculty<br />\nratio,\" according to Sharpe.<br />\nAccompanying all the<br />\ngrowth in the Department of<br />\nMechanics is a renovation of,<br />\nand addition to, Latrobe Hall.<br />\nGround should be broken<br />\nwithin a month for an 8000<br />\nsquare foot addition at the<br /><br />\n149-B, Lubec, Maine 04652.<br />\nApplications must be received<br />\nby the committee prior to<br />\nJuly 15, 1984.<br />\nPast Audubon Expedition<br />\nInstitute scholarships have<br />\nmade possible the fulfillment<br />\nof immediate education and<br />\ncareer goals, including interning in conservation organizations or participating in the<br />\nExpedition Institute's summer<br />\nexpeditions.<br /><br />\nTues., March 7, 7:30 p.m.:<br />\nWild America\u2014Backyard<br />\nWildlife; 8:00 p.m.: National<br />\n.Geographic Special\u2014Return , The Expedition Institute, a<br />\nIto Everest.<br />\nB.S. and M.S. one- to fouryear travel/study environmenThurs., March 8, 8:00 p.m.: tal education program, uses<br />\nnature\u2014Plight of the social and natural enBumblebee.<br />\nvironments as a classroom.<br />\nThe Institute is one of the<br />\nmany educational programs<br />\nA scholarship and grant sponsored by the National<br />\nprogram for high school, col- Audubon Society.<br />\nlege, and graduate students<br />\nhas been announced by the<br />\nNational Audubon Society<br />\nMicroscapes: The Hidden<br />\nExpedition Institute.

The result is<br />\nwhat you might expect: works<br />\nof varying quality ably staged<br />\nand performed with varying<br />\nskill. The one constant is enthusiasm. An energy crackles<br />\nthrough these productions<br />\nwhich is barely containable on<br />\nthe modest stage of the L/V<br />\nRoom,so naturally, some of it<br />\nleaps out and fires the audience.<br />\nWhich is as good a definition as<br />\nany of theater.<br />\nThe entire production is<br />\nspread over two nights.

The play founders a<br />\nlittle on some overblown<br />\nlanguage and has no resolution<br />\nto speak of, but it's buoyed by<br />\ngood work from Rich Bigelow<br />\nas the grandfather.<br />\nSecond is Change of Events<br />\nby Paul Murphy, a startling little blackout piece that gives new<br /><br />\nmeaning to the term \"male fantasy.\" John Peng and Mark<br />\nHughes contribute some lovely<br />\nbusiness as drunks in a bar<br />\nwhere the pickup scene can get<br />\npretty intense.<br />\nSermon in Stone, by Bruce<br />\nCohen, follows the first intermission. The author plays<br />\nRussell Jackalow, a high-school<br />\nsenior whose emotional reaction to his father's death three<br />\nyears before is preventing him<br />\nfrom planning his future, and<br />\ntearing him between two<br />\nsubstitute role models: an<br />\nEnglish teacher and a television<br />\ncomedian. The play is very insightful about such matters as<br />\nteacher/pupil relationships,<br />\nparental pride, and adolescent<br />\nidol worship, although again<br />\nthe resolution could use a little<br />\nwork. Deserving particular<br />\npraise here are Jim Sullivan,<br />\nwho (with the help of Cohen's<br />\nflabbergastingly accurate<br />\nmonologues) plays the comedian with just the right mix of<br />\nVegas schmaltz and New York<br />\nhipness; and Katherine Hassler,<br />\nwho, as Russell's mother, has<br />\na wonderful scene in which she<br />\ngives her son a graduation gift.<br />\nAfter another intermission<br />\ncome two plays, both of which<br />\nin their own ways are small<br />\nmarvels. Steve Barthelme's<br />\nClowns is about a couple whose<br />\nprincipal form of communication is the mindfuck, and it<br /><br />\ncontains some of the evening's<br />\nfinest writing. The author is<br />\nwise to the ways in which our<br />\nperceptions of others are too<br />\noften warped by our own deficiencies as human beings. The<br />\ncast (Elizabeth Levy, Larry<br />\nMilgrim, Beth Polasky) play<br />\nthe challenging roles in earnest,<br />\nbut maybe a little too earnestly: their occasionally overdramatic readings tend to<br />\ndampen the naturalism of the<br />\ndialogue, and thus of the<br />\nsituation.<br />\nThe first evening concludes<br />\nwith Joanne Hayden Coleman,<br />\n38, Suddenly, by Fae Dremock.<br />\nThis simple piece about a man<br />\nwhose stepsister's suicide drives<br />\nhim to a grief something like<br />\nmadness is a brooding, poetic<br />\nmeditation on life and death,<br />\ngiven shape by some intriguing<br />\nblocking and anchored by the<br />\npowerful performance of Bruce<br />\nMcKenzie.<br />\nThe second night consists of<br />\none full-length production, Inventory, by Jessica Kubzansky.<br />\nHilary Freer is Margaret, a thirtyish antique dealer resigned to<br />\nthe life of a spinster. Her<br />\nbrother (Gregg Heacock), a<br />\nyoung executive, and sister<br />\n(Sam Murray), whose impending marriage forms the central<br />\nconflict of the play, serve as<br />\ncontrast to Margaret's eventless<br />\nexistence. Enter Merwin (Paul<br />\nGarlinghouse), local eccentric,<br /><br />\nwho seems to have taken it<br />\nupon himself to bring Margaret<br />\njoy and excitement\u2014neither of<br />\nwhich she seems particularly interested in. Their odd intimacy<br />\ntakes up most of the second<br />\nhalf of the play, creating a<br />\nchance for Margaret to touch<br />\nhappiness.

At<br />\nleast here everyone's about<br />\nequal.\" She also believed<br />\nsomewhat her government's<br />\nclaims that America is mercilessly plagued by violence, inflation, and unemployment;<br />\nphenomena that are almost<br />\nunheard of in the Soviet Union.<br />\nBut Tanya was far from a<br />\nvehement idealogue.

Indeed, she admitted that<br />\nher country \"might have made<br />\nsome mistakes\" at the time.<br />\nBut she truly could not understand the persistence of the<br />\nHungarian's hatred. Nevertheless, she obeyed her teachers<br />\nwhen they told the students to<br />\nspeak only English on the trip.<br />\nThis advice resulted in at<br />\nleast one embarrassment for<br />\nOlga. To account for her<br />\nEnglish, she would often tell the<br />\nHungarians she met that she<br />\nwas from America.

Cook,<br />\nwho is quite tall, used his height<br />\nand reach effectively in this tall<br />\nman's weapon.<br />\nCaptain Pat Havens, starting<br />\nin his first MAC, faced all the<br />\ntop seeds early and, although<br />\nmaintaining a competitive<br />\nshowing, found himself at the<br />\nshort end of his four contests.<br />\nAlex Moen, a sophomore with<br />\nlimited experience this season,<br />\nreplaced Havens and was three<br />\nand three, winning three more<br />\nthan anyone expected.<br />\nThe sabre squad, which had<br />\nbeen frustratingly close to solid<br />\nall season, finally fell into a<br />\ngroove and captured the silver.<br />\nWales<br />\nShao,<br />\nanother<br />\nsophomore in his rookie<br />\nseason, beat many of the top<br />\nseeds and ended with a five and<br />\nfive record.<br />\nCaptain Taro Adachi, who<br /><br />\nhad a superlative season, was<br />\nseven and three. Finishing<br />\nfourth in the sabre, Adachi was<br />\none win short of a second place<br />\nfinish and an NCAA berth.<br />\nAdachi is hungry for next<br />\nseason when he figures to have<br />\nhis best year ever.<br />\nAndy Goldberg and Captain<br />\nDavid Wiener, who combined<br />\nfor 83 wins against only 15<br />\nlosses during the regular<br />\nseason, totally dominated the<br />\nfoil event, winning 18 out of 20<br />\nbouts. Goldberg, only a<br />\nsophomore, capped a brilliant<br />\nseason, where he lost only 4<br />\ntimes, by winning the foil with<br />\na 10-0 record. With only a few<br />\nshaky moments, like a 5-4 win<br />\nafter being down 4-1 against<br />\nyear's<br />\nchampion,<br />\nlast<br />\nGoldberg's dazzling display of<br />\ndexterity gave him first place.<br />\nWiener, a senior, took second place with an 8-2 mark,<br />\nlosing only to the Haverford<br />\nfencers. Wiener, who went to<br />\nthe NCAA's in his freshman<br />\nyear, failed to qualify the next<br />\ntwo seasons. But this year, he<br />\nand Goldberg secured the two<br />\nfoil berths from the MAC to<br />\nthis year's National Championship at Princeton.<br />\nAt the tournament, Hopkins<br />\nwas by far the most enthusiastic<br />\nsquad. Even the fencers who<br />\ndidn't get a chance to actually<br />\nfence participated by accumulating scores and keeping<br />\nthe starters abreast of the day's<br />\nevents.<br />\nJim Hoff, a sophomore who<br />\nbroke his finger and could not<br />\neven practice, .came along<br />\nanyway and offered his services<br />\nas the team's \"P.R.5!man. All<br />\nin all, the team effort was<br />\ntremendous, and the Blue Jay's<br />\nsuccess can most certainly be<br />\nattributed to it.<br /><br />\nMost proud of all, though,<br />\nwas Coach Oles. Besides the<br />\nteam and foil trophies, Coach<br />\nOles was awarded \"1984 Coach<br />\nof the Year\" by his colleagues.<br />\nAs he stood, surrounded by all<br />\nof his newly acquired \"hard-<br /><br />\nware\", the coach summed up<br />\nthe day: \"If I died today, it<br />\nwould take the undertaker a<br />\nmonth to get the grin off my<br />\nface.\"<br />\nOr the trophies out of his<br />\nhands.<br /><br />\nStarting From Scratch<br />\nHopkins' fencing is unique<br />\ncompared to most collegiate<br />\nprograms, relying on little or no<br />\nrecruiting. High school fencers<br />\nmust contact the coach first<br />\nbefore any talks can begin.<br />\nAlso, Hopkins awards no<br />\nfinancial incentives to lure top<br />\nlevel prospects.<br />\nAs a result, 90% of Coach<br />\nRichard Oles' freshman squad<br />\nhave never handled a blade outside of the kitchen or biology<br />\nlab. On the other hand, the<br />\nBlue Jays face teams comprised almost totally of fencers with<br />\nhigh school experience.<br />\nBut in their first varsity<br />\nseason, the \"home-growns\"<br />\nmanaged to win half their bouts<br />\nat last weekend's championship<br />\ntourney, enough to push<br />\nHopkins over the top.<br />\nThe bottom line is that<br />\nCoach Oles' methods work.<br />\nOver the twenty-two seasons,<br />\nOles has developed a program<br />\nthat pays particular attention to<br />\ndetail and precision. The fundamentals of the sport are reinforced practice after practice<br />\nwith countless (and endless)<br />\nfootwork and bladework drills.<br />\nThe coach complements this<br />\nwith athletic training that is<br />\nspecifically suited for fencing,<br />\nstressing endurance instead of<br />\nstrength.<br />\nFinally, Oles forces the team<br /><br />\nito know and understand all the<br />\nmany complicated rules and<br />\ntheir nuances. The result is an<br />\naura of confidence about the<br />\nfencers, a confidence that<br />\ncomes from knowing even the<br />\nmost subtle intricacies of the<br />\nsport.<br />\nOles, a recognized fencing<br />\nmaestro, offers each of his<br />\nfencers individual lessons.<br />\nThese lessons, about twenty<br />\nminutes in duration, encourage<br />\ntactical thinking as well as the<br />\nperfection of technique. Often,<br />\nthe coach will create bout-like<br />\nsituations, giving new fencers a<br />\nchance to react and move as<br />\nthey would in a real fencing<br />\nmatch; a substitute for the<br />\nmuch-needed experience that is<br />\na prerequisite for consistent<br />\nwinning.<br />\nAnd Oles does produce winners. Over the 30 years since the<br />\nMAC's inception, Hopkins is<br />\nsecond among all schools with<br />\nnine team championships.<br />\nStill, he is already looking<br />\nforward to next year. The present varsity, their competitive<br />\nseason over, is busy at work<br />\nteaching this year's crop of<br />\nfreshmen. After all, they are<br />\nonly second among the MAC<br />\nteams, and for Oles and his<br />\nBlue Jays, that's just not good<br />\nenough.<br /><br />\nHair Cutting &amp; Design<br />\nSummer<br />\nLanguage Institute<br /><br />\nHumanities, Social Sciences,<br />\nMathematics, and Statistics<br /><br />\nJune 18\u2014August io<br /><br />\nJune 18\u2014August io<br /><br />\nSciences<br /><br />\nThe Five-Week Semester<br /><br />\nJune +\u2014August 10<br /><br />\nJuly 9\u2014August io<br /><br />\nYale Summer Programs<br /><br />\nFor Men &amp; Women<br /><br />\n100 E. 33rd St. 1 BLOCK FROM CAMPUS<br />\nFor Appointment Tues-Sat Call<br />\n235-7083<br />\n10-<br /><br />\nYale Summer Programs present<br />\neach year a number of academic<br />\ncourses for credit.<br />\nStudents live in Silliman College\u2014<br />\none of Yale's Residential Colleges<br />\nand participate fully in the various<br />\nacademic, social, and cultural<br />\nactivities that take place during the<br />\nsummer.<br /><br />\nResources of the Yale University<br />\nLibrary, Art Gallery, British Art<br />\nCenter, and Peabody Museum of<br />\nNatural History are fully available<br />\nto the summer community.

Or grabbing a danish an hour after<br />\nbreakfast. At the time, you<br />\nthink you need it, but<br />\nsomewhere down the line, you<br />\nmust pay.<br />\nOver-recruiting won't hurt a<br />\ncoach's waistline. But too much<br />\nmaterial has caused more<br />\ncoaches to be fired than<br />\ncoaches getting new contracts.<br />\nThat's because a coach who<br />\nover-recruits, grabs one too<br />\nmany nosebleeders or floor<br />\ngenerals, usually ends up with<br />\na morale problem on his team,<br />\na problem that goes directly<br />\nback to playing time. It's okay<br />\nas long as you're winning, but<br />\nas soon as you stub your toe,<br />\nit's like an albatross around<br />\nyour neck.<br />\nIf a coach wants to make it ,<br />\n\"Uptown\", he must keep harmony on the end of the bench,<br />\nspread the publicity around.<br />\nThe problem is, if a guy plays<br />\n10 minutes and scores 10<br /><br />\npoints, he believes if he plays 40<br />\nminutes, he'll score 40 points.<br />\nPlus, the cash is affected by the<br />\nplayer's sphere of influence, his<br />\nparents, his buddies, and his<br />\ngirlfriend. They're the ones<br />\nwho are always patting him on<br />\nthe back, stroking him, saying,<br />\n\"shoot more,\" or \"why don't<br />\nyou play more?\"<br />\nI always thought, as a coach,<br />\nthat I never wanted to go past<br />\nmy seventh man, because when<br />\nyou show your eighth or ninth<br />\nman, you've suddenly got a<br />\nproblem with playing time.
