Each year men from .these concerns come to<br />\nHomewood to interview qualified students who will be in search<br />\nof employment following graduation.<br />\nUntil this year the response for these interviews has been<br />\noverwhelming. It happens now, however, that students who<br />\nexpect to enter the armed forces upon graduation are no longer<br />\ninterested in interviewing business representatives. This is a<br />\nmistake.<br />\nAny company that sends a representative to the campus cares<br />\nlittle about the draft or ROTC status of the students. Most all<br />\norganizations will hire approved men even if they expect to be<br />\ncalled to duty within a few weeks following graduation.<br />\nThe student has only to gain from interviews with these men.<br />\nHe could secure a job following graduation, even though it be for a<br />\nshort duration of time. He will have promise of employment<br />\nupon his discharge. He will have an opportunity to make valuable<br />\ncontacts with officials of various concerns and probably what is<br />\nmore important. he will have gained much needed experience in the<br />\nmethods and practices of commercial-ill:Aft-Viewing.<br />\nAny students who .can meet the qualifications for these interviews, which will be running from now, until Spring, should. take<br />\nadvantage of them. Their cost is \u2022 but a few minutes of a day<br />\nand yet their net gain can be of infinite value.<br />\n<br />\nSTILL WORTHWHILE<br />\nThe meeting this year of the annual convention of the Middle<br />\nAtlantic Region of the International Relations Clubs, scheduled<br />\non December 27, 28 and 29 in Levering Hall, has been heralded<br />\nby the blaring of several big names which appear now to be<br />\nrealistically and dimly distant. Justice William 0. Douglas will<br />\ndefinitely not make his appearance during the three-day assembly,<br />\nwhile there is some very, very slight chance that the delegates will<br />\nbe treated to addresses by Dean Acheson and John Foster Dulles.<br />\nThose students who represented the Hopkins Club in last<br />\nyear's congregation in Montreal requested that the convention of<br />\nthe current year be held at Homewood because they felt that both<br />\nthe delegations and our University would be benefited by the<br />\narrangement. Plans have since been formulited which have<br />\nswitched the focus of attention and discussion from the area of<br />\nEurope (treated at Montreal) to the area of Asia. A potentially<br />\ninteresting, though not spectacular, schedule of debates and<br />\nspeeches with a supporting slate of well-qualified speakers has<br />\nconsequently been arranged.<br />\nAsia has been divided into three parts, which will form the<br />\nthree basic subjects of the convention's work: China and Korea,<br />\nsouth-eastern Asia, and Japan. A separate panel of speakers has<br />\nbeen, and in some cases is still being, selected to dwell entirely on<br />\neach of these subjects. All three panels are to be formed of approximately five persons, professional men and presumably experts in<br />\ntheir fields representing the press, institutions of learning and the<br />\nState Department.<br />\nAlthough planned primarily for IRC representatives, this convention will be open to all those who are sincerely interested in<br />\nattending the sessions. It is, therefore, partially unfortunate that<br />\nthe dates fall within the Christmas holidays, when tio many resident students will not be here. In spite of, and in some measure<br />\nbecause of, the lack of \"big attractions,\" the conference gives<br />\nreal promise of being successful.<br />\n<br />\n'Street Scene' By Elmer Rice<br />\nScheduled For Four Day Run<br />\nBy WM.

William Zartman, Andrew<br />\nRoberts, Bill Hinton, Herb Alterman.<br /><br />\nOVERLOOKED VALUE<br />\nThe Bureau of Appointments, eampuS headquarters for student and post graduate employment, this week announced its<br />\nlarge interview schedule for the month of January.<br />\nIn the few years the Bureau has been in existence it has<br />\nestablished firm contacts with many national and local business<br />\norganizations. Each year men from .these concerns come to<br />\nHomewood to interview qualified students who will be in search<br />\nof employment following graduation.<br />\nUntil this year the response for these interviews has been<br />\noverwhelming. It happens now, however, that students who<br />\nexpect to enter the armed forces upon graduation are no longer<br />\ninterested in interviewing business representatives. This is a<br />\nmistake.<br />\nAny company that sends a representative to the campus cares<br />\nlittle about the draft or ROTC status of the students. Most all<br />\norganizations will hire approved men even if they expect to be<br />\ncalled to duty within a few weeks following graduation.<br />\nThe student has only to gain from interviews with these men.<br />\nHe could secure a job following graduation, even though it be for a<br />\nshort duration of time. He will have promise of employment<br />\nupon his discharge. He will have an opportunity to make valuable<br />\ncontacts with officials of various concerns and probably what is<br />\nmore important. he will have gained much needed experience in the<br />\nmethods and practices of commercial-ill:Aft-Viewing.<br />\nAny students who .can meet the qualifications for these interviews, which will be running from now, until Spring, should. take<br />\nadvantage of them. Their cost is \u2022 but a few minutes of a day<br />\nand yet their net gain can be of infinite value.<br /><br />\nSTILL WORTHWHILE<br />\nThe meeting this year of the annual convention of the Middle<br />\nAtlantic Region of the International Relations Clubs, scheduled<br />\non December 27, 28 and 29 in Levering Hall, has been heralded<br />\nby the blaring of several big names which appear now to be<br />\nrealistically and dimly distant. Justice William 0. Douglas will<br />\ndefinitely not make his appearance during the three-day assembly,<br />\nwhile there is some very, very slight chance that the delegates will<br />\nbe treated to addresses by Dean Acheson and John Foster Dulles.<br />\nThose students who represented the Hopkins Club in last<br />\nyear's congregation in Montreal requested that the convention of<br />\nthe current year be held at Homewood because they felt that both<br />\nthe delegations and our University would be benefited by the<br />\narrangement. Plans have since been formulited which have<br />\nswitched the focus of attention and discussion from the area of<br />\nEurope (treated at Montreal) to the area of Asia. A potentially<br />\ninteresting, though not spectacular, schedule of debates and<br />\nspeeches with a supporting slate of well-qualified speakers has<br />\nconsequently been arranged.<br />\nAsia has been divided into three parts, which will form the<br />\nthree basic subjects of the convention's work: China and Korea,<br />\nsouth-eastern Asia, and Japan. A separate panel of speakers has<br />\nbeen, and in some cases is still being, selected to dwell entirely on<br />\neach of these subjects. All three panels are to be formed of approximately five persons, professional men and presumably experts in<br />\ntheir fields representing the press, institutions of learning and the<br />\nState Department.<br />\nAlthough planned primarily for IRC representatives, this convention will be open to all those who are sincerely interested in<br />\nattending the sessions. It is, therefore, partially unfortunate that<br />\nthe dates fall within the Christmas holidays, when tio many resident students will not be here. In spite of, and in some measure<br />\nbecause of, the lack of \"big attractions,\" the conference gives<br />\nreal promise of being successful.<br /><br />\n'Street Scene' By Elmer Rice<br />\nScheduled For Four Day Run<br />\nBy WM.
