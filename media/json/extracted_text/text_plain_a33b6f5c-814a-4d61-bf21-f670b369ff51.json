Certainly it falls into none of these<br />\ncategories, hut just as certainly it exists. And not as a mere theory; ESP<br />\nis a proren, demonstrated fact.<br />\nFor example, how many times have you walked into a place you<br />\nnever saw before and yet recog ized everything? How many times have<br />\nyou known the exact words someone was going to say before he ever<br />\nsaid them? How many times have you been absolutely certain something was going to happen hundreds or even thousands of miles awaY<br />\nand, sure enough, it did?<br />\nLet me tell you about a case I am fortunately able to document.<br />\nSome years ago I went fishing with my dear friend Donald L. Fromkiss<br />\nat a virgin lake deep in the Canadian wilds. It was hellishly difficult to<br />\nget there, but we did not mind, for the moment we dropped our lines<br />\nwe each caught a splendid crappie. Mine weighed just over :300 pounds.<br />\nDonald's was somewhat smaller, but by far the friendlier.<br />\nImagine my surprise then when, before we could throw our lines<br />\nback for another try, Donald suddenly leaped up and cried he'd had a<br />\npremonition that he must go home immediately. He could not tell me<br />\nwhy. He only knew that some one or some thing was calling him back<br />\nand he had to go at once. Apologizing profusely, he left me alone on<br />\nthe lake and portaged to the nearest town (Moose Jaw, well over a<br />\nthousand miles, and poison sumac every inch), and there he chartered<br />\na Ford Tri-Motor and flew home.<br />\nWell sir, at first he felt like an utter dolt. Everything was perfectly<br />\nnormal at home. His wife Edith was quietly reading The Sensuou.<<br />\nWoman. His son Herschel was taking his daily glassblowing lesson his dog Trey was eating his leash.<br />\nAnd yet the premonition would not leave Donald. Carefully, he<br />\nwent through the house, inch by inch, room by room. Sure enough,<br />\nwhen he got to the back hall he suddenly heard a faint whimpering<br />\nnoise outside. He flang open the door. And there, by George, he saw<br />\nwhere the whimpering was coming from: someone had left a basket oo<br />\nthe back stoop!<br />\nWell sir, who can blame Donald for crying a cry of joy and triumph? What a find! A whimpering basket! That's something you don't<br />\nsee every day, let me tell you!<br />\nAnd so today, as you know of course, Donald L.

American<br />\nPresidents are still unwilling to \"lose.\" All they can do<br />\nis \"let loose.\" And where else can you go once you've<br />\nwasted South Vietnam, Cambodia and Laos? Why,.<br />\nNorth, of course.<br />\nYesterday's news dispatches from Washington and<br />\nSaigon lend awesome credence to Morganthau's<br />\nforecast. South Vietnamese President Thieu, out talking<br />\nto the people, told them it would be \"only a matter of<br />\ntime\" before an invasion of the North. And President<br />\nNixon,in his foreign policy address to Congress, pledged<br />\nas usual to maintain troop withdrawals while expanding<br />\nthe war. He said the U.S. would be faced with difficult<br />\nchoices. Every day the President makes the foundation<br />\nfor a sustained effort more solid.<br />\nHe should remember one thing. It's spring. And while<br />\nthe anti-war movement tries to get going on the<br />\ncampuses and in the cities, the Nixon Administration is<br />\nletting loose as usual on the plains and jungles of<br />\nIndochina. Unfortunately, the Administration works full<br />\ntime. Even more unfortunately, few of us work at all.<br />\n<br />\nPaying Later?<br />\nWithin the next two years Homewood will inherit<br />\nresponsibility for the salaries of 23 full-time professors<br />\nthat were formerly paid from foundation money. The<br />\ntab for these professors (eight per cent of the total<br />\nfaculty on campus) will be $500,000 annually. The shock<br />\nof this sudden monetary blow will ensure a sizable Arts<br />\nand Sciences deficit through much of the seventies.<br />\nHow did this happen? All indications point to the<br />\nAcademic Council, which adamantly guards its right to<br />\nexclusively select all faculty appointments. In the early<br />\n60's foundation grants were awarded to the Social<br />\nRelations Department and the McCollum -Pratt<br />\nInstitute (a biology research center) for a ten-year<br />\nperiod. According to knowledgeable sources, in those<br />\nprosperous days the Academic Council accepted any<br />\nmoney that was available with little interest in its future<br />\nimpl:-..ations. So two dozen assistant, associate and full<br />\nprofessors were hired by the Council, and now, when the<br />\ngrants run out with no replacements, the chickens have<br />\nindeed come home to roost.<br />\nThe $500,000 bill could force another tuition hike of<br />\n$200. And for what?--to support two departments which<br />\nhave a history of flagrantly ignoring undergraduates.<br />\nThe Social Relations Department, although it lists 22<br />\nfaculty members, does not permit undergraduate<br />\nmajors, and by now everybody should be aware that the<br />\nBiology Department has not lived up to its teaching<br />\nobligations by any standards.<br />\nCurrently federal money is easily available in<br />\nenvironmental engineering, social anthropology,<br />\noceanography and biology. Some of these departments<br />\ncould double in size with the influx of federal funding.<br />\nBut immediate questions remain: Is this the time for<br />\nHopkins to strongly concentrate in the ecology field? If<br />\nso, should the hired professors be asked to teach as well<br />\nas research, and what arrangements can be worked out<br />\nto insure that the school is not socked with another half<br />\nmillion dollar bill after ten years?<br />\nIt is the responsibility of the Academic Council to<br />\ninvite other faculty members, students and<br />\nadministrators to openly discuss these problems.<br />\nPerhaps then the twelve professors on the Council can<br />\nbetter avoid the disastrous mistakes of their<br />\npredecessors while still maintaining Hopkins' position<br />\nin the vanguard of research.<br />\n<br />\nLetters to<br />\nthe Editors<br />\n<br />\n-I'd Like To Trade In The Whole Thing For A Guy<br />\nWith A Horse And A Couple Of Lanterns<br />\nIn A Church Steeple\"<br />\n<br />\nDo Justice<br />\nTo the Editors:<br />\nDavid Jacobson's brief summary (News-Letter),<br />\nFebruary 23) of my recent<br />\nlong Science article could<br />\nhardly do justice to the<br />\ncomplex issues it discusses.<br />\nInterested persons should<br />\nconsult pages 640-647 of the<br />\nFebruary 19 issue of Science<br />\nor ask me for a reprint of the<br />\narticle.<br />\nJulian C.

Bumper<br />\nstickers said: \"Don't Let<br />\nThem Be Forgotten.\"<br />\nA poll conducted by Gallup<br />\nInternational showed that<br />\nmost Americans who had<br />\nheard about the treatment of<br />\nNorth<br />\nprisoners inside<br />\n<br />\nVietnam believed that they<br />\nare being tortured and<br />\nbeaten, receiving poor care<br />\nand medical attention, and<br />\nto<br />\nallowed<br />\nnot<br />\nare<br />\ncommunicate with their<br />\nfamilies. Only seven per cent<br />\nof those queried thought the<br />\nAmerican prisoners were<br />\n\"treated well,\" while 33 per<br />\ncent said they were sure that<br />\nthe Vietnamese had killed<br />\nprisoners.<br />\nThe Administration seemed<br />\nto have little to do with these<br />\nimpromptu outpourings. By<br />\nearly 1971, military men were<br />\nangrily rejecting the notion<br />\nthat the publicity over the<br />\nprisoner issue was in any way<br />\naimed at public opinion.<br />\nYet, shortly after the<br />\ndecision to go public was<br />\nmade in May, 1969, newsmen<br />\nwere told and wrote that<br />\nSecretary Laird and other'<br />\nofficials believed that the<br />\nprisoner issue could be used<br />\nto turn world opinion against<br />\nHanoi: it would \"deflect some<br />\nof the heat\" over Vietnam<br />\nfrom the U.S. to North<br />\nVietnam.<br />\nIn addition, there is a great<br />\ndeal of evidence--made<br />\navailable privately to me by<br />\nwives and mothers-- that the<br />\ngovernment had far more to<br />\ndo with creating the vast<br />\namount of publicity over the<br />\nprisoner issue than it has<br />\nacknowledged.<br />\nIn fact, the Pentagon's<br />\nattitude toward the wives and<br />\nmothers can be described as<br />\na dual one: it is both<br />\nextremely considerate and<br />\nextremely purposeful.<br />\n<br />\nOn details such as pay and<br />\nallowances, the meeting - sympathetic<br />\nby<br />\naided<br />\nCongressmen--has been<br />\nanxious to ease the situation<br />\nfor the suffering families of<br />\nprisoners.<br />\nThey have been provided<br />\nextended GI education and<br />\nhome loan benefits, a chance<br />\nto invest unlimited savings at<br />\n10 per cent interest, (other<br />\nfamilies may invest up to<br />\nspecial<br />\nand<br />\n$10,000),<br />\npermission to utilize military<br />\ntransportation when<br />\navailable.<br />\nMost wives and parents<br />\nhave had nothing but the<br />\nhighest praise for the<br />\nmilitary's tact in initially<br />\ninforming them of their new<br />\nstatus.

In my<br />\nOpinion the University can<br />\ntake a constructive step<br />\nforward and regain, its<br />\nleadership in American<br />\neducation by tendering this<br />\nresponsible position to Mr.<br />\nEdward Everett.<br />\nThat Mr. Everett has not<br />\nPreviously been suggested for<br />\nthe position is likely to inspire<br />\nsome negative reaction. but I<br />\nrespectfully submit that<br />\nthose who have previously<br />\nconcerned themselves with<br />\nthis matter do not monopolize<br />\nWisdom. A careful examination has led me to the<br />\nconclusion that Mr. Everett<br />\nall<br />\nfulfills<br />\nadmirably<br />\nreasonable specifications. As<br />\nThomas Jefferson said, let<br />\nfacts be submitted to a candid<br />\nworld:<br />\n(1) The new Dean should<br />\nhave remarkable credentials<br />\nof scholarship. Edward<br />\nFaithful readers will remember<br />\nMendelsohn, campus Alton B.<br />\nParker expert..<br />\n<br />\nEverett graduated with the<br />\nhighest honors of the Harvard<br />\nclass of 1811. He was the first<br />\nAmerican to receive a Ph.D.,<br />\nfrom the University of<br />\nGottingen in 1817.<br />\n(2) The new Dean should<br />\nhave demonstrated his<br />\ncommitment to equal rights<br />\nfor all. As President of<br />\nHarvard, Edward Everett<br />\nzealously defended the rights<br />\nof Negroes to attend his<br />\ninstitution.<br />\n(3) The new Dean should<br />\nan<br />\nimpressive<br />\nhave<br />\nadministrative background.<br />\nEdward Everett was not only<br />\nPresident of Harvard, but<br />\nserved as Governor of<br />\nMassachusetts and Secretary<br />\nof State.<br />\n(4) The new Dean should<br />\nconciliate<br />\nto<br />\nattempt<br />\nantagonistic factions. As a<br />\nEdward<br />\nU.S. Senator,<br />\nEverett was interested in<br />\nachieving a compromise<br />\nbetween North and South on<br />\nthe issue of slavery.<br />\n(5) The new Dean should<br />\nhave such presence of mind<br />\nas to be willing to admit his<br />\nmistakes. In his Gettysburg<br />\nAddress (the one before<br />\nLincoln's), Edward Everett<br />\nconceded that he may have<br />\n<br />\nsought compromise for too<br />\nlong a period. However, it<br />\nshould be noted that he was a<br />\nzealous supporter of the<br />\nUnion throughout the Civil<br />\nWar.<br />\n(6) The new Dean should be<br />\ninternationally<br />\nan<br />\nprepossessing figure. In a<br />\nletter of introduction for one<br />\nof Everett's tours of Europe,<br />\nPresident Lincoln said that it<br />\nmight be more appropriate<br />\nfor Everett to introduce the<br />\nPresident.<br />\n(7) The new Dean should<br />\nhave<br />\ninterdisciplinary<br />\ninterests. Edward Everett<br />\nwas not only a formidable<br />\npolitical figure, but a poet and<br />\na scholar of Classical and<br />\nmodern languages. In his<br />\nvarious lectures, he discussed<br />\nvirtually every subject of<br />\ncontemporary interest.<br />\n(8) The new Dean should be<br />\nable to assume a large burden<br />\nof public speaking at<br />\nUniversity functions. Edward<br />\nEverett was regarded among<br />\nAmerican<br />\nthe - premier<br />\norators for a large part of the<br />\nnineteenth century.<br />\n(9) The new Dean should<br />\nhave a background specially<br />\noriented to undergraduate<br />\neducation. It will be noted<br />\n<br />\nEd Mendelsohn<br />\nthat Harvard was an<br />\nundergraduate<br />\nessentially<br />\ninstitution through the many<br />\nyears of Edward Everett's<br />\nassociation.<br />\nthe<br />\naddition,<br />\nIn<br />\nappointment of Edward<br />\nbe an<br />\nEverett would<br />\nauspicious development in<br />\nregard to the University<br />\ndeficit. I can positively state<br />\nthat, in view of a medical<br />\nphenomenon which affected<br />\nhim in early 1865, Mr. Everett<br />\nwould serve to the fullest<br />\nextent of his current vigor<br />\na<br />\ndemanding<br />\nwithout<br />\nthe<br />\nIn<br />\nsalary.<br />\ne<br />\nconsiderabl<br />\nbroadest sense, his needs are<br />\nso inconsiderable that their<br />\nfulfillment would constitute<br />\nno strain whatever on<br />\nUniversity resources.<br />\nAlthough this is a difficult<br />\nperiod for our University, we<br />\nare not yet in so pitiable a<br />\nstate as to be potentially<br />\ninsensitive to the restorative<br />\npowers of great leadership.<br />\nOur task is to summon the<br />\nbest talent available to steer<br />\nour course; and before us is a<br />\nman who knows the wind and<br />\nthe tides, who will provide a<br />\nfirm and steady hand at the<br />\ntiller. That man is Mr.<br />\nEdward Everett.<br />\n<br />\ntrips, initiated by the women<br />\nthemselves, were usually<br />\nlocal<br />\nby<br />\nfinanced<br />\nnewspapers, television<br />\nstations, or civic clubs.<br />\nThere is no direct evidence<br />\nthat the Pentagon or any<br />\nother federal agency initiated<br />\nthe first few trips overseas or<br />\nfinanced any of them, but the<br />\ncertainly<br />\nPentagon<br />\nattempted to encourage such<br />\ntrips.<br />\nOn October 7, 1969, Air<br />\nForce wives received another<br />\nprivate letter from the<br />\nservice, discussing the Paris<br />\ntrips.<br />\n\"Although the government<br />\ndoes not feel this procedure is<br />\nproper in view of the<br />\nexistence of established<br />\nchannels for exchange of such<br />\n- information,\" the Air Force<br />\nletter said, \"we do not intend<br />\nto stand in the way of any<br />\nfamily members who might<br />\ndecide to travel to Paris.\"<br />\nThe next paragraph told<br />\nwives how to apply for<br />\npassports and offered to<br />\nassist them with military<br />\nadvisers while in Paris.<br />\nWives whose husbands<br />\nwere shot down over Laos<br />\nwere urged to write the North<br />\nVietnamese and say only that<br />\nhe was \"downed by North<br />\nin<br />\nforces<br />\nVietnamese<br />\nSoutheast Asia.\" The reason,<br />\nsaid the Air Force, was that<br />\nsuch an approach would<br />\n\"thus (a,void) forcing the<br />\nNorth Vietnamese to admit<br />\ntheir involvement in the<br />\ncomplex Laotian situation.\"<br />\nAt the time, of course, it was<br />\nthe United States which was<br />\nrefusing to acknowledge that<br />\nAmerican bombers were<br />\noperating at will inside Laos.<br />\nThe family's pressure on<br />\nthe North Vietnamese at<br />\nParis tied in neatly with the<br />\nAdministration's posture at<br />\nthe peace talks.

Scott Fitzgerald has<br />\nbeen twentieth century<br />\nAmerica's tragic literary<br />\nfigure for almost thirty years<br />\nnow. All his credentials have<br />\nbeen put in proper order:<br />\nearly establishment as a<br />\n\"bright young man\" at the<br />\nage of twenty-five with This<br />\nSide of Paradise and critical<br />\nsuccess and the beginnings of<br />\nartistic maturity with The<br />\nGreat Gatsby five years<br />\nlater. He was the man who<br />\nErnest<br />\nintroduced<br />\nHemingway to his publisher,<br />\nand who was the exemplar<br />\nPar excellence of the Jazz<br />\nAge.<br />\nThe future was seemingly<br />\nhis, but in the years<br />\nafter Gatsby he was a burnedout case--in debt, alcoholic,<br />\nand only haltingly productive. When he died in<br />\n1940, his reputation has been<br />\ncritically and financially<br />\nworthless for almost a<br />\ndecade.<br />\nHow to explain such<br />\ndecline, failure, and early<br />\ndeath after so much promise?<br />\nCritics have usually asserted<br />\nthat his wife Zelda--Zelda, the<br />\nWillful, spoiled Southern<br />\nbelle slowly slipping into schizoprenia--encouraged<br />\nthe wreckless spending and<br />\nthe wild parties, and<br />\ncompounded problems with<br />\nher prolonged and costly<br />\nPsychiatric treatment. It was<br />\nShe<br />\nScott<br />\nwho drove<br />\nFitzgerald to the bottle and<br />\ncut him down in his prime.<br />\nOne does not have to look<br />\nfar to reach this sort of<br />\nconclusion. Fitzgerald was<br />\nthe most auto-biographical of<br />\nwriters; it seems as if he had<br />\nto write, to work an assault on<br />\n<br />\n\u2022\u2022._ _<br />\nC. ASSIrIED<br />\n<br />\nEUROPE-Save on any three<br />\nflight plans. Information<br />\n<br />\nhis senses through his<br />\ncreative apparatus, before he<br />\ncould understand what was<br />\nhappening to him--and his<br />\nlater works from the period of<br />\nZelda's insanity, Tender Is<br />\nThe Night and The Crack-Up,<br />\nare testaments to his<br />\ntorturous experiences with<br />\nhis wife and alcohol. The<br />\ninherent problem, however,<br />\nis that these source materials<br />\nare one-sided since they come<br />\nfrom Fitzgerald's own hand.<br />\nIn light of this, Nancy<br />\nMilford's biography of \u2022Zelda<br />\nis a tour de force for the<br />\nsimple reason that she did<br />\ncompetent<br />\nany<br />\nwhat<br />\nbiographer should do: she<br />\nwent back to the proper<br />\nsources--Zelda's letters and<br />\ndiaries, and most important,<br />\nthe records of her psychiatric<br />\ntreatment.<br />\nPlainly, it is too simple to<br />\nlook to Zelda alone as the key<br />\nto Fitzgerald's tragedy. As a<br />\nwriter primarily interested in<br />\npeople, he was not so poor a<br />\njudge of character as to be<br />\ntotally blind to his wife's<br />\nextraordinary<br />\nmore<br />\nTheir<br />\ncharacteristics.<br />\ncourtship had been rough-almost a preview of things to<br />\ncome--and in marrying Zelda<br />\nhe made a positive gesture<br />\nimplying that he was<br />\nconscious of those darkening<br />\nfirst, he<br />\nthe<br />\nFrom<br />\nvenerated Zelda as an ideal,<br />\nas the arch-typical woman<br />\nwhom he described in his<br />\nfictional heroines. They were<br />\nvivacious<br />\nand<br />\nspirited<br />\nbecause he admired such<br />\nqualities in his women,and he<br />\nwas no more equipped to<br />\ncriticize the embodiment of<br />\nhis ideal than is any other<br />\n<br />\nman.<br />\nconsequence,<br />\na<br />\nAs<br />\nFitzgerald was a passive<br />\npartner in his marriage: he<br />\nwas an adoring observer. He<br />\ncast Zelda in a role which<br />\nsuited his own personality<br />\nand artistic needs, and it was<br />\ndifficult for him to think that<br />\na time might come when one<br />\nof his own heroines, as proud<br />\nand independent as any in his<br />\nfiction, might wish to<br />\nestablish a personality of<br />\nown.<br />\nher<br />\nThe first signs of crisis<br />\ncame shortly after they<br />\nmoved to France in order for<br />\nFitzgerald to escape their<br />\ncontinual rounds of partying<br />\nand to get some serious work<br />\ndone. Zelda had been<br />\naccustomed since adolescence to being a center<br />\nof attention and the first<br />\nyears of post-marriage<br />\nfestivities had presented no<br />\nchange.<br />\nWhen the party ended, she<br />\nbegan to feel deserted; when<br />\nher husband cloistered<br />\nhimself with his writing, she<br />\nfound being known as the wife<br />\nof a famous artist too<br />\nconfining.<br />\nHer drive to create an<br />\nindividual identity<br />\nmanifested itself in ballet and<br />\nin writing. The first activity is<br />\npart of the Fitzgerald legend.<br />\nShe started serious study<br />\nwhile in her early thirties, too<br />\nlate to develop the first-rate<br />\nartistry she demanded of<br />\nherself. Nevertheless, she<br />\nextraordinary<br />\nexpended<br />\namounts of time and energy<br />\ntrying to perfect her<br />\ntechnique, and her seemingly<br />\nendless practice sessions<br />\nwere the first concrete signs<br />\nof impending collapse.<br />\n<br />\nBut ballet had been a<br />\nsecond choice as an artistic<br />\noutlet; the first had been<br />\nwriting. Her desire to write<br />\nemerged from Fitzgerald's<br />\nacknowledgment of her<br />\nconsiderable descriptive<br />\ntalents, granted when he<br />\nopenly and frequently raided<br />\nher diaries and letters for<br />\nmaterial to fashion and give<br />\nsubstance to his stories and<br />\ncharacters.<br />\nFitzgerald was at first<br />\nflattered by her attempts. He<br />\nhelped with suggestions and<br />\nrevisions, evidently<br />\nharboring the hope that his<br />\nto<br />\nbegin<br />\nwould<br />\nwife<br />\nappreciate the demands of his<br />\nwork. Yet all but a handful of<br />\nthe pieces were credited to<br />\n\"Mr. and Mrs. F. Scott<br />\nFitzgerald\" when published.<br />\nMiss Milford asserts that<br />\nthis was a way of either<br />\nindicating Fitzgerald's hand<br />\nin the final product, or<br />\ninsuring that a market would<br />\nbe found among otherwise<br />\nwary editors. Whatever the<br />\ngood intentions, the joint<br />\nauthorship device defeated<br />\nZelda's purpose for, in effect<br />\nshe remained an extention of<br />\nher husband.<br />\nSo long as Fitzgerald could<br />\nparticipate in Zelda's writing,<br />\nhe thought it a fine idea; but<br />\nwhen she wrote her only<br />\ncompleted novel,Save Me The<br />\nWaltz, and arranged to have<br />\nit published without her<br />\nhusband's foreknowledge, his<br />\nreaction only displayed the<br />\ndegree to which he was<br />\nunwilling to allow her an<br />\nindependent identity.<br />\nZelda wrote her book while<br />\nundergoing psychiatric<br />\ntreatment in Baltimore's<br />\nSheppard-Pratt.

Certainly it falls into none of these<br />\ncategories, hut just as certainly it exists. And not as a mere theory; ESP<br />\nis a proren, demonstrated fact.<br />\nFor example, how many times have you walked into a place you<br />\nnever saw before and yet recog ized everything? How many times have<br />\nyou known the exact words someone was going to say before he ever<br />\nsaid them? How many times have you been absolutely certain something was going to happen hundreds or even thousands of miles awaY<br />\nand, sure enough, it did?<br />\nLet me tell you about a case I am fortunately able to document.<br />\nSome years ago I went fishing with my dear friend Donald L. Fromkiss<br />\nat a virgin lake deep in the Canadian wilds. It was hellishly difficult to<br />\nget there, but we did not mind, for the moment we dropped our lines<br />\nwe each caught a splendid crappie. Mine weighed just over :300 pounds.<br />\nDonald's was somewhat smaller, but by far the friendlier.<br />\nImagine my surprise then when, before we could throw our lines<br />\nback for another try, Donald suddenly leaped up and cried he'd had a<br />\npremonition that he must go home immediately. He could not tell me<br />\nwhy. He only knew that some one or some thing was calling him back<br />\nand he had to go at once. Apologizing profusely, he left me alone on<br />\nthe lake and portaged to the nearest town (Moose Jaw, well over a<br />\nthousand miles, and poison sumac every inch), and there he chartered<br />\na Ford Tri-Motor and flew home.<br />\nWell sir, at first he felt like an utter dolt. Everything was perfectly<br />\nnormal at home. His wife Edith was quietly reading The Sensuou.&lt;<br />\nWoman. His son Herschel was taking his daily glassblowing lesson his dog Trey was eating his leash.<br />\nAnd yet the premonition would not leave Donald. Carefully, he<br />\nwent through the house, inch by inch, room by room. Sure enough,<br />\nwhen he got to the back hall he suddenly heard a faint whimpering<br />\nnoise outside. He flang open the door. And there, by George, he saw<br />\nwhere the whimpering was coming from: someone had left a basket oo<br />\nthe back stoop!<br />\nWell sir, who can blame Donald for crying a cry of joy and triumph? What a find! A whimpering basket! That's something you don't<br />\nsee every day, let me tell you!<br />\nAnd so today, as you know of course, Donald L. Fromkiss and<br />\nHis Whimpering Basket is one of the highest paid acts in show business.

The<br />\ntab for these professors (eight per cent of the total<br />\nfaculty on campus) will be $500,000 annually. The shock<br />\nof this sudden monetary blow will ensure a sizable Arts<br />\nand Sciences deficit through much of the seventies.<br />\nHow did this happen? All indications point to the<br />\nAcademic Council, which adamantly guards its right to<br />\nexclusively select all faculty appointments. In the early<br />\n60's foundation grants were awarded to the Social<br />\nRelations Department and the McCollum -Pratt<br />\nInstitute (a biology research center) for a ten-year<br />\nperiod. According to knowledgeable sources, in those<br />\nprosperous days the Academic Council accepted any<br />\nmoney that was available with little interest in its future<br />\nimpl:-..ations. So two dozen assistant, associate and full<br />\nprofessors were hired by the Council, and now, when the<br />\ngrants run out with no replacements, the chickens have<br />\nindeed come home to roost.<br />\nThe $500,000 bill could force another tuition hike of<br />\n$200. And for what?--to support two departments which<br />\nhave a history of flagrantly ignoring undergraduates.<br />\nThe Social Relations Department, although it lists 22<br />\nfaculty members, does not permit undergraduate<br />\nmajors, and by now everybody should be aware that the<br />\nBiology Department has not lived up to its teaching<br />\nobligations by any standards.<br />\nCurrently federal money is easily available in<br />\nenvironmental engineering, social anthropology,<br />\noceanography and biology. Some of these departments<br />\ncould double in size with the influx of federal funding.<br />\nBut immediate questions remain: Is this the time for<br />\nHopkins to strongly concentrate in the ecology field? If<br />\nso, should the hired professors be asked to teach as well<br />\nas research, and what arrangements can be worked out<br />\nto insure that the school is not socked with another half<br />\nmillion dollar bill after ten years?<br />\nIt is the responsibility of the Academic Council to<br />\ninvite other faculty members, students and<br />\nadministrators to openly discuss these problems.<br />\nPerhaps then the twelve professors on the Council can<br />\nbetter avoid the disastrous mistakes of their<br />\npredecessors while still maintaining Hopkins' position<br />\nin the vanguard of research.<br /><br />\nLetters to<br />\nthe Editors<br /><br />\n-I'd Like To Trade In The Whole Thing For A Guy<br />\nWith A Horse And A Couple Of Lanterns<br />\nIn A Church Steeple\"<br /><br />\nDo Justice<br />\nTo the Editors:<br />\nDavid Jacobson's brief summary (News-Letter),<br />\nFebruary 23) of my recent<br />\nlong Science article could<br />\nhardly do justice to the<br />\ncomplex issues it discusses.<br />\nInterested persons should<br />\nconsult pages 640-647 of the<br />\nFebruary 19 issue of Science<br />\nor ask me for a reprint of the<br />\narticle.<br />\nJulian C.

Note: The following is the<br />\nthird part of an examination \u2022 by<br />\na Pulitzer-Prize winning reporter<br />\nof the controversial question of<br />\nAmerican POW's held in North<br />\nVietnam.<br />\nBy SEYMOUR HERSH<br />\n1970,<br />\nThroughout<br />\nsympathy<br />\nAmerica's<br />\ninstinctively went out to the<br />\nwives and families of the<br />\nmissing and captured men.<br />\nDuring the year, millions of<br />\nAmericans signed petitions<br />\nasking Hanoi to stop<br />\nmistreating the captured<br />\nmen. Hundreds of thousands<br />\nof letters were mailed to<br />\nCommunist capitals around<br />\nthe world urging officials to<br />\ninto<br />\nHanoi<br />\npressure<br />\nthe<br />\nof<br />\nall<br />\nng<br />\nimplementi<br />\nprovisions of the Geneva<br />\nConvention.<br />\nMost of the Senate and<br />\nmore than 400 of the 435<br />\nmembers of the House<br />\nand<br />\ndismay<br />\nexpressed<br />\noutrage over the treatment of<br />\nUnited States prisoners. The<br />\nPost Office issued a special<br />\nstamp commemorating their<br />\nCaptivity. Wives and mothers<br />\nof the missing and captured<br />\nmen formed groups and clubs<br />\naround the nation--with a<br />\nnational office in Washington<br />\n--demanding that the Nixon<br />\nAdministration do all it could<br />\nfor their men. Bumper<br />\nstickers said: \"Don't Let<br />\nThem Be Forgotten.\"<br />\nA poll conducted by Gallup<br />\nInternational showed that<br />\nmost Americans who had<br />\nheard about the treatment of<br />\nNorth<br />\nprisoners inside<br /><br />\nVietnam believed that they<br />\nare being tortured and<br />\nbeaten, receiving poor care<br />\nand medical attention, and<br />\nto<br />\nallowed<br />\nnot<br />\nare<br />\ncommunicate with their<br />\nfamilies. Only seven per cent<br />\nof those queried thought the<br />\nAmerican prisoners were<br />\n\"treated well,\" while 33 per<br />\ncent said they were sure that<br />\nthe Vietnamese had killed<br />\nprisoners.<br />\nThe Administration seemed<br />\nto have little to do with these<br />\nimpromptu outpourings. By<br />\nearly 1971, military men were<br />\nangrily rejecting the notion<br />\nthat the publicity over the<br />\nprisoner issue was in any way<br />\naimed at public opinion.<br />\nYet, shortly after the<br />\ndecision to go public was<br />\nmade in May, 1969, newsmen<br />\nwere told and wrote that<br />\nSecretary Laird and other'<br />\nofficials believed that the<br />\nprisoner issue could be used<br />\nto turn world opinion against<br />\nHanoi: it would \"deflect some<br />\nof the heat\" over Vietnam<br />\nfrom the U.S. to North<br />\nVietnam.<br />\nIn addition, there is a great<br />\ndeal of evidence--made<br />\navailable privately to me by<br />\nwives and mothers-- that the<br />\ngovernment had far more to<br />\ndo with creating the vast<br />\namount of publicity over the<br />\nprisoner issue than it has<br />\nacknowledged.<br />\nIn fact, the Pentagon's<br />\nattitude toward the wives and<br />\nmothers can be described as<br />\na dual one: it is both<br />\nextremely considerate and<br />\nextremely purposeful.<br /><br />\nOn details such as pay and<br />\nallowances, the meeting - sympathetic<br />\nby<br />\naided<br />\nCongressmen--has been<br />\nanxious to ease the situation<br />\nfor the suffering families of<br />\nprisoners.<br />\nThey have been provided<br />\nextended GI education and<br />\nhome loan benefits, a chance<br />\nto invest unlimited savings at<br />\n10 per cent interest, (other<br />\nfamilies may invest up to<br />\nspecial<br />\nand<br />\n$10,000),<br />\npermission to utilize military<br />\ntransportation when<br />\navailable.<br />\nMost wives and parents<br />\nhave had nothing but the<br />\nhighest praise for the<br />\nmilitary's tact in initially<br />\ninforming them of their new<br />\nstatus. All four services have<br />\nspecial personnel sections<br />\ndealing with the missing and<br />\ncaptured families, and each<br />\nfamily is provided the name<br />\nof an officer on whom they<br />\ncan call for personal help or<br />\ncomfort.<br />\nMost of the family<br />\nmembers, especially the<br />\nwives, share their husband's<br />\nlove of the service. Anti-war<br />\ndemonstrators are anathema<br />\nto the families and difficult<br />\nfor the wives and mothers to<br />\nunderstand. The families are<br />\nloath to do or say anything<br />\npublicly that could hurt their<br />\npilots careers.<br />\nThe women, by and large,<br />\nhave one major point of view<br />\nin common: They will do<br />\nwhatever the Pentagon<br />\ntells them to.<br />\nThe Pentagon began asking<br />\nthem to do things shortly<br /><br />\nnews<br />\nMay<br />\nthe<br />\nafter<br />\nconference taking the issue to<br />\nthe public.

In my<br />\nOpinion the University can<br />\ntake a constructive step<br />\nforward and regain, its<br />\nleadership in American<br />\neducation by tendering this<br />\nresponsible position to Mr.<br />\nEdward Everett.<br />\nThat Mr. Everett has not<br />\nPreviously been suggested for<br />\nthe position is likely to inspire<br />\nsome negative reaction. but I<br />\nrespectfully submit that<br />\nthose who have previously<br />\nconcerned themselves with<br />\nthis matter do not monopolize<br />\nWisdom. A careful examination has led me to the<br />\nconclusion that Mr. Everett<br />\nall<br />\nfulfills<br />\nadmirably<br />\nreasonable specifications. As<br />\nThomas Jefferson said, let<br />\nfacts be submitted to a candid<br />\nworld:<br />\n(1) The new Dean should<br />\nhave remarkable credentials<br />\nof scholarship. Edward<br />\nFaithful readers will remember<br />\nMendelsohn, campus Alton B.<br />\nParker expert..<br /><br />\nEverett graduated with the<br />\nhighest honors of the Harvard<br />\nclass of 1811. He was the first<br />\nAmerican to receive a Ph.D.,<br />\nfrom the University of<br />\nGottingen in 1817.<br />\n(2) The new Dean should<br />\nhave demonstrated his<br />\ncommitment to equal rights<br />\nfor all. As President of<br />\nHarvard, Edward Everett<br />\nzealously defended the rights<br />\nof Negroes to attend his<br />\ninstitution.<br />\n(3) The new Dean should<br />\nan<br />\nimpressive<br />\nhave<br />\nadministrative background.<br />\nEdward Everett was not only<br />\nPresident of Harvard, but<br />\nserved as Governor of<br />\nMassachusetts and Secretary<br />\nof State.<br />\n(4) The new Dean should<br />\nconciliate<br />\nto<br />\nattempt<br />\nantagonistic factions. As a<br />\nEdward<br />\nU.S. Senator,<br />\nEverett was interested in<br />\nachieving a compromise<br />\nbetween North and South on<br />\nthe issue of slavery.<br />\n(5) The new Dean should<br />\nhave such presence of mind<br />\nas to be willing to admit his<br />\nmistakes. In his Gettysburg<br />\nAddress (the one before<br />\nLincoln's), Edward Everett<br />\nconceded that he may have<br /><br />\nsought compromise for too<br />\nlong a period. However, it<br />\nshould be noted that he was a<br />\nzealous supporter of the<br />\nUnion throughout the Civil<br />\nWar.<br />\n(6) The new Dean should be<br />\ninternationally<br />\nan<br />\nprepossessing figure. In a<br />\nletter of introduction for one<br />\nof Everett's tours of Europe,<br />\nPresident Lincoln said that it<br />\nmight be more appropriate<br />\nfor Everett to introduce the<br />\nPresident.<br />\n(7) The new Dean should<br />\nhave<br />\ninterdisciplinary<br />\ninterests. Edward Everett<br />\nwas not only a formidable<br />\npolitical figure, but a poet and<br />\na scholar of Classical and<br />\nmodern languages. In his<br />\nvarious lectures, he discussed<br />\nvirtually every subject of<br />\ncontemporary interest.<br />\n(8) The new Dean should be<br />\nable to assume a large burden<br />\nof public speaking at<br />\nUniversity functions. Edward<br />\nEverett was regarded among<br />\nAmerican<br />\nthe - premier<br />\norators for a large part of the<br />\nnineteenth century.<br />\n(9) The new Dean should<br />\nhave a background specially<br />\noriented to undergraduate<br />\neducation. It will be noted<br /><br />\nEd Mendelsohn<br />\nthat Harvard was an<br />\nundergraduate<br />\nessentially<br />\ninstitution through the many<br />\nyears of Edward Everett's<br />\nassociation.<br />\nthe<br />\naddition,<br />\nIn<br />\nappointment of Edward<br />\nbe an<br />\nEverett would<br />\nauspicious development in<br />\nregard to the University<br />\ndeficit. I can positively state<br />\nthat, in view of a medical<br />\nphenomenon which affected<br />\nhim in early 1865, Mr. Everett<br />\nwould serve to the fullest<br />\nextent of his current vigor<br />\na<br />\ndemanding<br />\nwithout<br />\nthe<br />\nIn<br />\nsalary.<br />\ne<br />\nconsiderabl<br />\nbroadest sense, his needs are<br />\nso inconsiderable that their<br />\nfulfillment would constitute<br />\nno strain whatever on<br />\nUniversity resources.<br />\nAlthough this is a difficult<br />\nperiod for our University, we<br />\nare not yet in so pitiable a<br />\nstate as to be potentially<br />\ninsensitive to the restorative<br />\npowers of great leadership.<br />\nOur task is to summon the<br />\nbest talent available to steer<br />\nour course; and before us is a<br />\nman who knows the wind and<br />\nthe tides, who will provide a<br />\nfirm and steady hand at the<br />\ntiller. That man is Mr.<br />\nEdward Everett.<br /><br />\ntrips, initiated by the women<br />\nthemselves, were usually<br />\nlocal<br />\nby<br />\nfinanced<br />\nnewspapers, television<br />\nstations, or civic clubs.<br />\nThere is no direct evidence<br />\nthat the Pentagon or any<br />\nother federal agency initiated<br />\nthe first few trips overseas or<br />\nfinanced any of them, but the<br />\ncertainly<br />\nPentagon<br />\nattempted to encourage such<br />\ntrips.<br />\nOn October 7, 1969, Air<br />\nForce wives received another<br />\nprivate letter from the<br />\nservice, discussing the Paris<br />\ntrips.<br />\n\"Although the government<br />\ndoes not feel this procedure is<br />\nproper in view of the<br />\nexistence of established<br />\nchannels for exchange of such<br />\n- information,\" the Air Force<br />\nletter said, \"we do not intend<br />\nto stand in the way of any<br />\nfamily members who might<br />\ndecide to travel to Paris.\"<br />\nThe next paragraph told<br />\nwives how to apply for<br />\npassports and offered to<br />\nassist them with military<br />\nadvisers while in Paris.<br />\nWives whose husbands<br />\nwere shot down over Laos<br />\nwere urged to write the North<br />\nVietnamese and say only that<br />\nhe was \"downed by North<br />\nin<br />\nforces<br />\nVietnamese<br />\nSoutheast Asia.\" The reason,<br />\nsaid the Air Force, was that<br />\nsuch an approach would<br />\n\"thus (a,void) forcing the<br />\nNorth Vietnamese to admit<br />\ntheir involvement in the<br />\ncomplex Laotian situation.\"<br />\nAt the time, of course, it was<br />\nthe United States which was<br />\nrefusing to acknowledge that<br />\nAmerican bombers were<br />\noperating at will inside Laos.<br />\nThe family's pressure on<br />\nthe North Vietnamese at<br />\nParis tied in neatly with the<br />\nAdministration's posture at<br />\nthe peace talks.

Scott Fitzgerald has<br />\nbeen twentieth century<br />\nAmerica's tragic literary<br />\nfigure for almost thirty years<br />\nnow. All his credentials have<br />\nbeen put in proper order:<br />\nearly establishment as a<br />\n\"bright young man\" at the<br />\nage of twenty-five with This<br />\nSide of Paradise and critical<br />\nsuccess and the beginnings of<br />\nartistic maturity with The<br />\nGreat Gatsby five years<br />\nlater. He was the man who<br />\nErnest<br />\nintroduced<br />\nHemingway to his publisher,<br />\nand who was the exemplar<br />\nPar excellence of the Jazz<br />\nAge.<br />\nThe future was seemingly<br />\nhis, but in the years<br />\nafter Gatsby he was a burnedout case--in debt, alcoholic,<br />\nand only haltingly productive. When he died in<br />\n1940, his reputation has been<br />\ncritically and financially<br />\nworthless for almost a<br />\ndecade.<br />\nHow to explain such<br />\ndecline, failure, and early<br />\ndeath after so much promise?<br />\nCritics have usually asserted<br />\nthat his wife Zelda--Zelda, the<br />\nWillful, spoiled Southern<br />\nbelle slowly slipping into schizoprenia--encouraged<br />\nthe wreckless spending and<br />\nthe wild parties, and<br />\ncompounded problems with<br />\nher prolonged and costly<br />\nPsychiatric treatment. It was<br />\nShe<br />\nScott<br />\nwho drove<br />\nFitzgerald to the bottle and<br />\ncut him down in his prime.<br />\nOne does not have to look<br />\nfar to reach this sort of<br />\nconclusion. Fitzgerald was<br />\nthe most auto-biographical of<br />\nwriters; it seems as if he had<br />\nto write, to work an assault on<br /><br />\n\u2022\u2022._ _<br />\nC. ASSIrIED<br /><br />\nEUROPE-Save on any three<br />\nflight plans. Information<br /><br />\nhis senses through his<br />\ncreative apparatus, before he<br />\ncould understand what was<br />\nhappening to him--and his<br />\nlater works from the period of<br />\nZelda's insanity, Tender Is<br />\nThe Night and The Crack-Up,<br />\nare testaments to his<br />\ntorturous experiences with<br />\nhis wife and alcohol. The<br />\ninherent problem, however,<br />\nis that these source materials<br />\nare one-sided since they come<br />\nfrom Fitzgerald's own hand.<br />\nIn light of this, Nancy<br />\nMilford's biography of \u2022Zelda<br />\nis a tour de force for the<br />\nsimple reason that she did<br />\ncompetent<br />\nany<br />\nwhat<br />\nbiographer should do: she<br />\nwent back to the proper<br />\nsources--Zelda's letters and<br />\ndiaries, and most important,<br />\nthe records of her psychiatric<br />\ntreatment.<br />\nPlainly, it is too simple to<br />\nlook to Zelda alone as the key<br />\nto Fitzgerald's tragedy. As a<br />\nwriter primarily interested in<br />\npeople, he was not so poor a<br />\njudge of character as to be<br />\ntotally blind to his wife's<br />\nextraordinary<br />\nmore<br />\nTheir<br />\ncharacteristics.<br />\ncourtship had been rough-almost a preview of things to<br />\ncome--and in marrying Zelda<br />\nhe made a positive gesture<br />\nimplying that he was<br />\nconscious of those darkening<br />\nfirst, he<br />\nthe<br />\nFrom<br />\nvenerated Zelda as an ideal,<br />\nas the arch-typical woman<br />\nwhom he described in his<br />\nfictional heroines. They were<br />\nvivacious<br />\nand<br />\nspirited<br />\nbecause he admired such<br />\nqualities in his women,and he<br />\nwas no more equipped to<br />\ncriticize the embodiment of<br />\nhis ideal than is any other<br /><br />\nman.<br />\nconsequence,<br />\na<br />\nAs<br />\nFitzgerald was a passive<br />\npartner in his marriage: he<br />\nwas an adoring observer. He<br />\ncast Zelda in a role which<br />\nsuited his own personality<br />\nand artistic needs, and it was<br />\ndifficult for him to think that<br />\na time might come when one<br />\nof his own heroines, as proud<br />\nand independent as any in his<br />\nfiction, might wish to<br />\nestablish a personality of<br />\nown.<br />\nher<br />\nThe first signs of crisis<br />\ncame shortly after they<br />\nmoved to France in order for<br />\nFitzgerald to escape their<br />\ncontinual rounds of partying<br />\nand to get some serious work<br />\ndone. Zelda had been<br />\naccustomed since adolescence to being a center<br />\nof attention and the first<br />\nyears of post-marriage<br />\nfestivities had presented no<br />\nchange.<br />\nWhen the party ended, she<br />\nbegan to feel deserted; when<br />\nher husband cloistered<br />\nhimself with his writing, she<br />\nfound being known as the wife<br />\nof a famous artist too<br />\nconfining.<br />\nHer drive to create an<br />\nindividual identity<br />\nmanifested itself in ballet and<br />\nin writing. The first activity is<br />\npart of the Fitzgerald legend.<br />\nShe started serious study<br />\nwhile in her early thirties, too<br />\nlate to develop the first-rate<br />\nartistry she demanded of<br />\nherself. Nevertheless, she<br />\nextraordinary<br />\nexpended<br />\namounts of time and energy<br />\ntrying to perfect her<br />\ntechnique, and her seemingly<br />\nendless practice sessions<br />\nwere the first concrete signs<br />\nof impending collapse.<br /><br />\nBut ballet had been a<br />\nsecond choice as an artistic<br />\noutlet; the first had been<br />\nwriting. Her desire to write<br />\nemerged from Fitzgerald's<br />\nacknowledgment of her<br />\nconsiderable descriptive<br />\ntalents, granted when he<br />\nopenly and frequently raided<br />\nher diaries and letters for<br />\nmaterial to fashion and give<br />\nsubstance to his stories and<br />\ncharacters.<br />\nFitzgerald was at first<br />\nflattered by her attempts. He<br />\nhelped with suggestions and<br />\nrevisions, evidently<br />\nharboring the hope that his<br />\nto<br />\nbegin<br />\nwould<br />\nwife<br />\nappreciate the demands of his<br />\nwork. Yet all but a handful of<br />\nthe pieces were credited to<br />\n\"Mr. and Mrs. F. Scott<br />\nFitzgerald\" when published.<br />\nMiss Milford asserts that<br />\nthis was a way of either<br />\nindicating Fitzgerald's hand<br />\nin the final product, or<br />\ninsuring that a market would<br />\nbe found among otherwise<br />\nwary editors. Whatever the<br />\ngood intentions, the joint<br />\nauthorship device defeated<br />\nZelda's purpose for, in effect<br />\nshe remained an extention of<br />\nher husband.<br />\nSo long as Fitzgerald could<br />\nparticipate in Zelda's writing,<br />\nhe thought it a fine idea; but<br />\nwhen she wrote her only<br />\ncompleted novel,Save Me The<br />\nWaltz, and arranged to have<br />\nit published without her<br />\nhusband's foreknowledge, his<br />\nreaction only displayed the<br />\ndegree to which he was<br />\nunwilling to allow her an<br />\nindependent identity.<br />\nZelda wrote her book while<br />\nundergoing psychiatric<br />\ntreatment in Baltimore's<br />\nSheppard-Pratt.

It<br />\npasses 1000 feet north of Fort<br />\nMcHenry and eventually<br />\njoins the J. F. Kennedy<br />\nHighway. Another segment<br />\ncontinues the Jones Falls<br />\nexpressway south, passing<br />\nthrough Fells Point.<br />\nThe highway will displace<br />\nhomes and industry in its<br />\npath and its proposed<br />\nconstruction has been the<br />\nsubject of numerous federally<br />\nrequired public hearings over<br />\nthe past few years.<br />\nSome citizens in or near the<br />\npath of the road object to any<br />\nexpressway construction at<br />\nall.
