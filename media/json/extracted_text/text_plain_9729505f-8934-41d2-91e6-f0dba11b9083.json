We agree<br />\nwith the many criticisms of the<br />\nprocess by which the seals are<br />\nawarded and feel that the best<br />\nway to truly recognize accomplishment is to leave the<br />\ndecision to the senior class.<br />\nWe feel the best way to proceed is to require all students<br />\nwho wish to be considered to<br />\nsubmit to the senior class officers a standard application<br />\nwhich includes an essay describing the student's activities. To<br />\navoid a massive influx of candidates, specific prerequisites<br />\nshould be included; one possible example is at least two years<br />\nof active participation in a student group or a Student Council committee. In addition, we<br />\nfeel that activity in a fraternity<br />\n<br />\nor sorority should be considered on equal footing with<br />\nactivity in a studetn group. By<br />\nusing this process, each student<br />\nhas the opportunity to present<br />\nhis credentials and thus<br />\neliminate the possibility of being overlooked.<br />\nWe also agree with the contention that the large number of<br />\nSAC seals reduces the<br />\nsignificance of the award. To<br />\nrectify the situation, one of two<br />\noptions should be considered:<br />\nlimiting once again the number<br />\nof seals to 25, or, as Maureen<br />\nsuggested, instituting a twotiered system where a very small<br />\nnumber of special awards will<br />\nbe given to those with exceptional contributions to student<br />\nlife and a larger number of seals<br />\nwill be given to those with<br />\nnoteworthy contributions.<br />\nIn short, we feel the current<br />\nsystem of awarding SAC seals<br />\nis inadequate and misrepresentative. A new process should be<br />\ninstituted to make these awards<br />\nmore meaningful.<br />\n<br />\nWho's Telling the Truth?<br />\nTo the Editor:<br />\n<br />\nI read last week's NewsLetter article on Campus<br />\nSecurity with both anger and<br />\ndisappointment. The NewsLetter and reporter Bruce<br />\nAlpert abandoned the journalistic responsibility for acblatantly<br />\ncuracy<br />\nand<br />\nmisrepresented<br />\nJessica<br />\nHalprin's version of the security incident of January 17 to the<br />\ndetriment of efforts to improve<br />\nsecurity in the Hopkins<br />\ncommunity.<br />\nAccording to the article,<br />\nHalprin says she was offered a<br />\nfoot escort by the officer in<br />\ncharge of that night's shift. The<br />\narticle then implies that she<br />\nrefused the offer. Precisely the<br />\nopposite is true. As clearly<br />\nstated in her letter of February<br />\n17, \"I then demanded that they<br />\nsend someone on foot to escort<br />\nme home, which was immediately refused with no explanation whatsoever.\" These<br />\nScott Schmitt two versions are completely<br />\nLaury Hutt contradictory, Alpert's incor-<br />\n<br />\nrect account effectively undermining Ms. Halprin's charges<br />\nagainst Security. At minimum<br />\nAlpert and the News-Letter owe<br />\nher a public apology. The rest<br />\nof the article displays a similar<br />\nuncritical acceptance of Major<br />\nLarkin's version of the<br />\nincident.<br />\nI have no doubts about the<br />\naccuracy of Halprin's account.<br />\n' I have known her for many<br />\nyears and she is a scrupulously<br />\nhonest person. In fact, I was in<br />\nthe library the night in question<br />\nand can vouch for much of her<br />\nstory. Besides, Major Larkin's<br />\nversion is implausible: someone<br />\nconcerned about possible attack<br />\nwould not refuse the one safe<br />\nalternative\u2014an escort\u2014if<br />\noffered.<br />\nMy suspicion about Major<br />\nLarkin's account is heightened<br />\nby the knowledge that this<br />\nwould not be the first time that<br />\nCampus Security has refused to<br />\nescort female students. I know<br />\nof several instances in which<br />\nCampus Security refused to<br />\nfulfill their obligation to provide publicly offered escort services. Rather than an isolated<br />\n<br />\nincident, the events of January<br />\nare a generic case. Someone in<br />\nCampus Security is not telling<br />\nthe truth, and it is the women<br />\nof this University who are paying the price. The bottom line<br />\nis that Campus Security is either<br />\nunwilling or unable to meet<br />\ntheir responsibilities to the<br />\nHopkins community.<br />\nThe incident of January 17<br />\nhad a happy ending\u2014Ms.<br />\nHalprin found a ride home.

The<br />\nsame cannot be said for shoddy security work.<br />\nMarcus Noland<br />\nEditor's Note: Because of a<br />\ntypographical error in Bruce<br />\nAlpert's article, it was incorrectly stated that Campus<br />\nSecurity offered Jessica Halprin<br />\nafoot escort. According to her<br />\nletter of February 17, she, in<br />\nfact, wasn't offered a foot<br />\nescort.

For example,<br />\nchallenges are being made that<br />\nalter scholars' views concerning<br />\nthe progression of history.<br />\n<br />\nWestern historians have<br />\ndepicted history as a series of<br />\npolitical events marked by the<br />\npresence of great men. While<br />\nthese catalysts change political<br />\nstructures, they often do not<br />\nsignificantly alter the position<br />\nof women. Thus, women have<br />\nby and large been ignored in<br />\nwestern history.<br />\nRevision in the areas of anpsychology,<br />\nthropology,<br />\npolitical science, sociology and<br />\neconomics are shedding new<br />\nlight on once central assumptions in these fields. There is an<br />\nimmediate need to make<br />\nHopkins curriculum responsive<br />\nto this research. Endowed with<br />\na small grant from the Kenan<br />\nFund for the improvement of<br />\nundergraduate education,<br />\nHartsock, Martin and Begus<br />\ncreated a course to meet this<br />\nneed and in doing so, set an example of innovation and<br />\nacademic excellence.<br />\n<br />\nThe nature of the material<br />\ncovered in \"Women in History,<br />\nSociety\"<br />\nand<br />\nCulture<br />\nnecessitates that it be taught as<br />\nan interdisciplinary course.<br />\nScholarly research on women<br />\ndoes not occur in isolated<br />\npockets, but transcends the<br />\ninterdisciplines.<br />\nThe<br />\ndisciplinary aspect enhances the<br />\ncourse. Exposure to scholars,<br />\nresearch and students from different, but related, fields<br />\nbroadens one's scope of<br />\nknowledge.<br />\nThe interdisciplinary outlook<br />\nof the course is reflected in the<br />\nunique format of this course on<br />\nwomen. The course is divided<br />\ninto two time periods. Each<br />\nweek, a guest speaker from the<br />\ndiscipline being studied lectures<br />\nand answers questions during a<br />\ntwo-hour class.

This<br />\nsemester's lecturers have included Rayna Rapp, a pioneer<br />\nof scholarship on women in anthropology (Department of Anthropology, the New School for<br />\nSocial Research), and Carroll<br />\nSmith-Rosenberg, the preeminent historian chronicling<br />\nwomen's roles in historical<br />\nscholarship (Departments of<br />\nHistory and Psychiatry and<br />\nDirector of Women's Studies,<br />\nUniversity of Pennysylvania),<br />\njust to name a fsw. Each lecturer represents the highest level<br />\nof scholarly research in their<br />\nfields. Not surprisingly, each<br />\nlecture attracts several of<br />\nHopkins faculty members who<br />\naudit the class. It is the<br />\nstudents, however, not the<br />\nfaculty, with whom the lecturers are impressed. Many<br />\nspeakers have commented that<br />\nthey are pleasantly surprised<br />\nwith the depth and intelligence<br />\nof students' questions and their<br />\ninterest in the subject matter.<br />\nBecause of the controversial<br />\nnature of the material presented<br />\nin this course, a one-hour section is held following each lecture. The section is used to<br />\ndiscuss assigned readings, lecture material, or anything<br />\nweighing on peoples' minds.<br />\nThe time in section is usually<br />\nspent in heated debate. Sarah<br />\nBegus says that the section is<br />\nessential because you can't give<br />\nstudents controversial material<br />\nwhich radically alters their accepted assumptions and not<br />\ngive them time to talk about it.<br />\nFor example, discussions have<br />\ncentered around women's participation in the labor force.<br />\nSuch notions as comparable<br />\npay for comparable worth and<br />\nchanging traditional family<br />\nroles reflected in labor force<br />\nparticipation have been<br />\naddressed.<br />\nWhile sitting in on \"Women<br />\n<br />\nin History, Culture and Society\", many things become evident. The first is that enthusiasm for the subject, so rare<br />\namong Hopkins faculty, exudes<br />\nfrom Sarah Begus and Emily<br />\nMartin who have undertaken<br />\nthe task of teaching the course.<br />\nThe second thing is the quality<br />\nof scholarly research presented.<br />\nHopkins students have the unique opportunity to become acquainted with research which is<br />\nnow seen as central for an<br />\nunderstanding of social science<br />\ndisciplines. Third, one sees the<br />\npopular and genuine support of<br />\nthe student body for such<br />\ncourses. Rarely do 50 men and<br />\nwomen register for a new non<br />\ncore-curriculum course. This<br />\ncertainly is a strong statement<br />\nattesting that the time for such<br />\ncourses on a permanent basis<br />\nhas come.<br />\nIn the past, Hopkins has offered courses dealing with<br />\nscholarship on women on a<br />\ndepartmental level. These<br />\ncourses, however, have unfortunately been the exception, not<br />\nthe rule. Interestingly, all major research universities including Harvard, Yale,<br />\nPrinceton, University of Pennsylvania, Duke(the list goes on)<br />\nhave active women's studies<br />\nprograms that offer courses<br />\nessential to undergraduate<br />\neducation as a whole. The success of this course proves that<br />\nJohns Hopkins should follow<br />\nsuit.<br />\n\"Women in History, Culture<br />\nand Society\" and the professors,<br />\ninvolved in it represent quality<br />\neducation at its finest. The<br />\ncourse elicits excitement from<br />\nall who are involved in it. Unfortunately, the Kenan Fund<br />\ngrant is only for one year.

The Center<br />\nhas three main areas of concentration: research, public service, and education.<br />\nIn conjunction with the<br />\nCenter's interest in international urban planning, Hopkins<br />\nhas established an urban studies<br />\ncenter in Lille, France. On<br />\nSeptember 21, 1983, Hopkins<br />\nPresident, Steven Muller, and<br />\nPresident of the Nord-Pas de<br />\nCalais Regional Council, Noel<br />\nJosephe, signed a cooperative<br />\nagreement for the establishment<br />\nof a University center for the<br />\nstudy of regional planning. The<br />\nobjectives of this new center are<br />\nto develop joint research with<br />\nFrench and European counterparts, to accommodate<br />\nmeetings and conferences on<br />\nsubjects of common interest to<br />\nthe Europeans and Americans,<br />\nand to train professionals and<br />\nadministrators in the issues confronting old industrial areas in<br />\ntheir transformation to more<br />\nmodern economic activities.<br />\n1 The center will be financed<br />\njointly by Johns Hopkins and<br />\nthe Region, and by research<br />\ngrants. The Metro Center at<br />\nHopkins has long been committed to comparative international research and study. Lille,<br />\nin the northeast of Europe, is<br />\neasily accessible to Belgium,<br />\nGermany, the Netherlands, and<br />\nEngland. Therefore, it is<br />\nfavorable to international<br />\ngatherings. Lille is also a city of<br />\nolder industrial firms, much<br />\nlike Baltimore. The Lille Center<br />\nwill provide the Metro Center<br />\nand the larger Hopkins community with a long-desired<br />\nEuropean base for studies in urban and regional planning.<br />\nResearch is done by the<br />\nCenter on various topics concerning local, state, and national metropolitan problems.<br />\nThe Center does not offer any<br />\ndegree programs, but through<br />\nthe Evening College, people can<br />\nreceive a Master of Science in<br />\nUrban Planning and Policy<br />\nManagement. The Center also<br />\nsponsors numerous seminars,<br />\nconferences, and symposia on<br />\nurban problems.<br />\nUrban Planning includes all<br />\naspects of metropolitan pro-<br />\n<br />\nKristin Comstock<br />\n<br />\nMetro Center, which was created in 1972, is directed by Jack C.

In<br />\n1857, a well known Baltimore merchant, George<br />\nPeabody, desiring to hasten the city's cultural development, proposed the establishment of an educational<br />\ninstitution consisting of a Library, Art Gallery,<br />\nAcademy of Music, and Lecture Series. The first<br />\nbuilding, housing the Conservatory, was completed in<br />\n1861, but dedication was delayed another five years<br />\nbecause of the Civil War. The Conservatory commenced formal instruction in 1868, with 148 students.<br />\nOver the next century, Peabody continued to grow<br />\nin both size and prestige, adding significantly to the<br />\ncultural life of Baltimore. Many great works of music<br />\nreceived their area premieres at Peabody, and the Institute played a major role in the establishment of the<br />\nBaltimore Symphony Orchestra. Today, there remain<br />\nclose ties between the two, with over one-third of the<br />\nof Orchestra's members being Peabody faculty.<br />\nIn 1977, financial considerations resulted in the formal affiliation of the Peabody Institute with the Johns<br />\nHopkins University. The formal relationship of the<br />\n<br />\nBill Meeker<br />\n<br />\nA Pseudo-Greek statue adorning the inside of Peabody.<br />\n<br />\ntwo schools has a strong historical precedent. Not only<br />\nhave Hopkins and Peabody often cooperated in<br />\nacademic ventures for many years, but their respective founders, George Peabody and Johns Hopkins,<br />\nwere close friends. Peabody once referred to Hopkins<br />\nas \"the only man more thoroughly anxious to make<br />\nmoney than myself.\" Much of Hopkins' inspiration<br />\nin endowing the school and hospital which bear his<br />\nname is said to have come from Peabody.<br />\nToday, the Peabody Conservatory enrolls about 500<br />\nstudents pursuing undergraduate, graduate, and<br />\nspecial degrees in various musical fields. They have<br />\ncome to Peabody from all over the United States and<br />\nseveral foreign countries, drawn by Peabody's tremendous reputation for excellence in musical education.<br />\nPeabody graduates are represented among the ranks<br />\nof the finest orchestras and opera companies in the<br />\n<br />\nLarry Volz<br />\n<br />\ncountry. The school's commitment to providing a level<br />\nof culture to the city of Baltimore remains unabated,<br />\nwith the Conservatory acting, in the words of one student, as a \"direct feeder into the Baltimore Opera<br />\nCompany and Symphony Orchestra.\"<br />\nAt first glance, Peabody would seem to represent<br />\na radically different side of the Johns Hopkins family. But talk to a Peabody student, and you will soon<br />\nfind that the Conservatory and Homewood share<br />\nmuch more than just a formal University affiliation.<br />\nPeabody students express many of the same concerns<br />\nabout their school and student life that are so often<br />\nheard here at Homewood.<br />\nLike other Hopkins institutions, Peabody has a well<br />\ndeserved reputation for academic pressure that seems<br />\nalmost a component part of the high level of academic<br />\nexcellence at the school. Just as Hopkins students must<br />\nsqueeze extra hours out of each day to complete an<br />\nOrgo lab or History paper, so do Peabody students<br />\nfind their time far too insufficient for the amount of<br />\npractice, performance, and ensemble work they are expected to complete. Students mentioned two main problems stemming from this pressure which will be all<br />\ntoo familiar to the Homewood undergraduate.<br />\nBecause of the limited number of top places in orchestras, opera companies, and such, there often<br />\ndevelops extreme competition between students. The<br />\nHopkins pre-med may be surprised to learn that<br />\nthroats exist among music students. But while there<br />\nis no mutilation of lab results, there is a problem of<br />\nsome students hogging precious practice rooms. Mary<br />\nCarole Brown, now a senior Natural Sciences major,<br />\ntransferred to Hopkins after two years as a trumpet<br />\nmajor at Peabody. Brown says that while she was at<br />\nthe Conservatory, she often saw students \"cheer\"<br />\nwhen one of their fellows made a mistake in a difficult<br />\npassage. The general attitude, as Brown saw it, was<br />\nthat the other students represented too great a tnreat<br />\nto risk helping someone improve his skills.<br />\nMost at Peabody, however, do not feel that the<br />\nsituation is so extreme. \"Our careers as musicians will<br />\nbe oriented towards a group function,\" says Marci<br />\nPlait, a graduate student in voice. She finds that most<br />\nstudents are willing to work together, and notes that<br />\nensemble requirements make some group effort<br />\nunavoidable.<br />\nAlso stemming from the severe time demands is the<br />\nlack of a strong student social life pointed to any<br />\nPeabody students. Their complaints sound iike an echo<br />\nof the continual griping of Homewoodians about the<br />\nnon-existant social life at Hopkins. Mark Paris, the<br />\nPresident of Peabody's Student Council, points out<br />\nthat the entire budget for student activities at the Conservatory is $5000, or about $10 per student. Compare<br />\nthat to the SAC budget at Hopkins and you can begin<br />\nto imagine the seriousness of the problem.<br />\nThe quality of teaching and the attitude of Professors towards students is yet another theme which<br />\nis common to both divisions. According to Tom Arnold, a voice student, the Conservatory suffers from<br />\n\"the misconception that a good performer is necessarily a good teacher.\" Paris agrees, saying that it is<br />\n\"risky\" to have musicians who are adept at the skill<br />\nof playing an instrument teaching courses not concerned with technical proficiency. While the students agree<br />\nthat the Peabody faculty abounds in excellent musicians, they feel that it includes too few excellent<br />\nteachers.<br />\n<br />\nPart of the blame, says Plait, is attributable to the<br />\nlack of any system of evaluation by students of<br />\nteachers. This problem has been addressed by the Student Council, which recently initiated course evaluations similar to those used by the Course Guide. So<br />\nfar, the evaluations have met with positive response<br />\nfrom students and teachers alike. Another Council<br />\nproposal, an award to be given at graduation to a<br />\nteacher selected by the students, is being considered<br />\nby the Peabody administration.<br />\nAnother difficulty that students often experience<br />\nregarding professors is their lack of availability for advising. \"Faculty participation with students,\" says<br />\nParis, \"is greatest during practice and ensemble sessions.\" Outside of the class or practice room, students<br />\nfeel, there is too little formal or informal interaction<br />\nbetween students and faculty. Many faculty members<br />\nare also professional musicians, and thus have little<br />\ntime to devote to their students.<br />\nThe very existence of the Student Council at<br />\nPeabody is tribute to the growing interest in improving student life at the Conservatory. When Mark Paris<br />\narrived at Peabody after receiving an undergraduate<br />\n<br />\nSpiral staircase presents aerial view of the stallaureni z<br />\ndegree in Politics from Muhlenberg, there was no Student Council and few student organizations of any<br />\nkind. \"Three years ago,\" he says, \"this place was a<br />\ndesert?' While interest among the students is still<br />\nmarginal, it is growing. The council publishes the<br />\nweekly Peabody Rag which lets members of the<br />\nPeabody community know what is going on. They<br />\nhave also instituted a Grievance Board, with Tom Arnold as chairman, to identify and attempt to resolve<br />\nstudent complaints. The Board receives complaints in<br />\nwriting and then communicates them to the appropriate administration or faculty person. In the first<br />\nmonth, the Grievance Board received six written complaints, and has received administration responses to<br />\nfour of these.<br />\nOne interesting suggestion voiced by the students is<br />\na closer tie between the students at Homewood and<br />\nthe Conservatory. Paris holds an extreme view on this<br />\nidea, expressing a desire to \"dig this whole block up<br />\nand move it up to Homewod.\" He cited the security<br />\nproblems of Peabody's campus and its isolation from<br />\nother Baltimore schools as reasons to relocate the Conservatory. However, realizing that such a solution is<br />\nmost unlikely, Paris proposes that Peabody students<br />\nmight live with students at Homewood, have some<br />\nrepresentation on the Student Council here, and participate in student activities. Others at Peabody react<br />\nfavorably to his suggestion that Conservatory students<br />\nbe welcome to join Hopkins fraternities and athletic<br />\nteams.\"We have a double bass player here who would<br />\nmake a terrific linebacker for the football team,\" says<br />\nArnold, referring to a Peabody student who has actually considered professional sports.<br />\n\"I'd like to see Peabody be the music students of<br />\nJohns Hopkins,\" says Paris. He points out that excellence in music is directly tied to excellence in other<br />\nfields around it. \"You have to be able to think before<br />\nyou can be a musician.\"<br />\nAnd the music students would not be the only ones<br />\nwho could profit from such ties. Who knows, that guy<br />\nnext to you in Orgo lab may be the next Pablo Casals<br />\njust waiting to be uncovered.<br />\n<br />\n\f\u2022<br />\n<br />\nSports<br />\nHOPKINSLACROSSE:The New Era Begins<br />\nby Bill Bernstein<br />\nWhen Don Zimmerman was named head lacrosse<br />\ncoach last October, he attained his life-long ambition.<br />\nZimmerman succeeded nine-year veteran Henry Ciccarone, who retired from coaching in order to pursue<br />\na career in business. 1984, then, will mark the beginning of a new era in Blue Jay lacrosse.<br />\nComing off a 12-2 1983 season, including a 17-16<br />\nNCAA Division I Championship Game loss to<br />\nSyracuse, second-ranked Hopkins will open the 1984<br />\nlacrosse season tomorrow when they host UMBC at<br />\n2:00 p.m.(WJHU, 88.1 FM).<br />\nUnder Ciccarone, the Blue Jays compiled an overall<br />\nrecord of 105-16 and won three national championships. Zimmerman, who was an honorable mention<br />\nAll-America midfielder at Hopkins in 1975, began<br />\nhis varsity coaching career at Princeton. He then spent<br />\nfour years as offensive coordinator on Willie Scroggs'<br />\nNorth Carolina coaching staff before returning to<br />\nHomewood in 1983. During Zimmerman's stint at<br />\nCarolina, the Tar Heels won two national<br />\nchampionships.<br />\nLast season, Zimmerman served as Ciccarone's chief<br />\nassistant, as the Blue Jays reached the NCAA finals<br />\nfor the seventh straight year. In what was perhaps one<br />\nof the most exciting lacrosse games ever played, 17,000<br />\nspectators watched Hopkins jump out to a 12-5 lead<br />\nbefore Syracuse staged an incredible comeback in the<br />\ngame's final 22 minutes.<br />\nAfter Jay defender Marty Bergin left the game with<br />\nan injury, the Hopkins defense broke down. Syracuse<br />\noutscored the Blue Jays 10-3 in the final 17 minutes<br />\nto capture their first championship since 1924.<br />\n\"It was the hardest loss of my life,\" said senior captain Willy Odenthal. \"I'm glad we learned from it.<br />\nYou can never let up.\"<br />\n1983 NCAA Division<br />\nFinal Lacrosse Rankings<br />\nNo.<br />\n,1<br />\n2<br />\n3<br />\n4<br />\n5<br />\n6<br />\n7<br />\n8<br />\n<br />\nSchool<br />\nSyracuse<br />\nJohns Hopkins<br />\nVirginia<br />\nArmy<br />\nNorth Carolina<br />\nMaryland<br />\nPenn<br />\nCornell<br />\n<br />\nRecord<br />\n14-1<br />\n12-2<br />\n10-2<br />\n11-3<br />\n9-4<br />\n9-5<br />\n10-3<br />\n8-4<br />\n<br />\n\"I thought we did very well last year,\" Zimmerman<br />\nsaid. \"With what we had, 1983's team went as far as<br />\nit could go. I was very proud of their performance.<br />\nThis season, I think we're stronger in the attack. Give<br />\nus time, and we'll be as strong in the midfield as<br />\ndefense. We'll take it one game at a time and see how<br />\nwe develop.\"<br />\nOn attack, the Jays lost Rob Lord and Gary Benninghoff to graduation. They should be easily replaced<br />\nwith three lettermen returning to the attack unit: captain Odenthal, honorable mention All-American Peter<br />\nScott, and senior Brent Ciccarone.<br />\nOdenthal was elected captain \"out of respect for his<br />\ndesire, attitude, and ability. He's doing an outstanding job,\" said Zimmerman.<br />\n\"The team has a great attitude this year. It's a<br />\nclosely knit team, and there's as much talent or more<br />\non this club than on any since my freshman year,\"<br />\nOdenthal said. \"I'm trying to stay as tight as I can<br />\nwith the players. We've been working especially hard<br />\nthis year to get that little extra that it's going to take<br />\nto win the championship.\"<br />\nIn addition to the three returning seniors, transfer<br />\nGeoff Nordberg, along with freshmen Brian Wood<br />\nand Craig Bubier should contribute to make the Blue<br />\nJay attack one of the most powerful units in the<br />\nnation.<br />\n\"We certainly have much more depth than last year.<br />\nWe'll get more production out of this year's attack as<br />\ncompared to last season's,\" the coach said.<br />\nWood, who scored seven goals in a scrimmage<br />\nagainst Delaware, will start with Scott and Odenthal.<br />\nCiccarone will share the crease responsibilities with<br />\nOdenthal.<br />\nAlthough the Jays graduated two All-America midfielders in 1983, Hopkins has another pair of AllAmerica middies returning. First team All-American<br />\nDel Dressel and third team All-American John<br />\n<br />\nKrumenacker should fill the void left by the departures<br />\nof Bill Cantelli and Henry Ciccarone, Jr.<br />\n\"It looks really promising,\" noted Dressel. \"We<br />\nhave a lot of unselfish players on offense, all of whom<br />\nare capable of scoring three goals on a given day.\"<br />\nAlso returning on the midfield are senior Rich Glancy, juniors Lee Davidson and Greg Matthews, and<br />\nsophomore Chris Schreiber. Joining these veterans are<br />\nfreshmen Bruce Chanenchuk, Tom Engelke and Jack<br />\nCrawford and transfers John Tucker, Dave Castle,<br />\nGlenn Fik:ge and Steve Mutscheller.<br />\n\"We ha-.'e some very experienced midfielders returning, and we brought in some nice players to complement them,\" Zimmerman added.<br />\nAll-Americans Dressel and Krumenacker will be<br />\nplaced on the same line this season. Along with<br />\nfreshman Chanenchuk, they will man the first line.<br />\nThis combination gives us a real potent first midfield,\" said Zimmerman.<br />\nTucker will head up the second line, teaming with<br />\nGlancy and Engelke. Schreiber, Mutscheller and Castle will staff the third line.<br />\nFidge will take faceoffs with the first unit, Matthews<br />\nwith the second, and Davison with the third.<br />\nMatthews will handle the opening faceoff in tomorrow's game, according to the coach.<br />\n\"It's a very competitive atmosphere for midfield<br />\npositions,\" Zimmerman said. \"This is going to make<br />\nus a stronger team. If guys aren't producing, there are<br />\nother people waiting to step in.\"<br />\n\"It's a healthy competition,\" agreed Dressel.<br />\n\"Coach Zimmerman is stressing that everyone is going to have a role.

Bowling<br />\nGreen went on to win that one,<br />\nbut then DePaul and coach Ray<br />\nMeyer grabbed the brass ring<br />\nby beating the Falcons, behind<br />\nGeorge Mikan, the first of the<br />\ngreat big men.<br />\nAnother memorable NIT<br />\nwould have to be 1950, when<br />\nCity College of New York<br />\nbecame the only team in college<br />\nhistory to win both the NIT and<br />\nthe NCAA in the same year.<br />\nBack in those days, you could<br />\nenter both, and Bradley University was the Beavers' victim in<br />\nthe title game both times.<br />\nOver the years, the NIT has<br />\nbeen a showcase for great<br />\nplayers, like Tommy Heinsohn,<br />\nKevin<br />\nLenny<br />\nWilkins,<br />\nLoughery, John Shumate, Gary<br />\nBrokaw and who can ever<br />\nforget Sihugo Green, who<br />\nscored 33 points in Duquesne's<br />\n1955 title victory!<br />\nPersonally, I'll never forget<br />\nwhen Southern Illinois held<br />\nGeorge (Brute Force) Thompson, Marquette's all-time<br />\nleading scorer, to 12 points and<br />\nWalt Frazier scored 21 to beat<br />\nus in the 1967 title game. And,<br />\nof course, the 1970 NIT, which<br />\nwe won, after I'd told the<br />\nNCAA to take a hike when they<br />\nsent us out of our mideast<br />\nregional to the midwest.<br />\nDuring my playing days at<br />\nSt. John's, in the early 1950's,<br />\nwe went to the NIT three times<br />\nunder Frank McGuire. Back<br />\nthen, the garden was the<br />\nZenith, Miller time, the<br />\nultimate stage for all coaches<br />\nand ballplayers to appear on.<br />\nThat's the old garden I'm talking about, on 49th St. and 8th<br />\nAve. It was the first place college basketball became big<br />\nbusiness.<br />\n<br />\nThere are, in my opinion,<br />\nthree ways the NIT might still<br />\nsurvive. One way they might exist is by taking eight of the 32<br />\nfirst-round losers from the<br />\nNCAA tourney each year, and<br />\nstage a shoot-out at the garden.<br />\nThere's always a number of<br />\nwild upsets in the first round,<br />\nwhich could end up being a<br />\nbonanza rather than a Dunkirk<br />\nfor the NIT.<br />\nThe only drawback is, they'd<br />\nhave to get permission from<br />\nShawnee Mission to do that,<br />\nand I'd bet the farm, Shawnee<br />\nmight be a little slow on the<br />\ndraw.<br />\nThe NIT could also consider<br />\ninviting four European teams<br />\nagainst four predominantly<br />\neastern teams to get the regional<br />\nflavor that would attract the<br />\nstudent bodies and alumni.<br />\nAgain, those four might be<br />\nschools that didn't make the<br />\nNCAA.<br />\nStart of the season, a preseason shoot-out on Thanksgiving weekend, bringing in eight<br />\npowers from<br />\ndynamite<br />\nthroughout the country, with a<br />\nlimited amount of flavor for<br />\nthe Big East television corridor<br />\nfrom Boston to Washington,<br />\nD.C.<br />\nBy doing that, it would allow<br />\n<br />\ncontinuity, and would keep<br />\nalive the NIT tradition that has<br />\ntruly been one of the centerpieces of collegiate basketball<br />\nfor more than 40 years.<br />\nUnless one of those three options become reality, it's taps city for the NIT. The first option<br />\nwon't happen because it would<br />\ntake away something from the<br />\nNCAA Tourney, and since<br />\nthey're in competition dollarwise and publicity-wise, it's<br />\ndoubtful the NCAA would be<br />\nthat charitable. Look for<br />\nScrooge McDuck to open his<br />\nvalue first.<br />\nThe problem with the second<br />\noption is that it would need the<br />\nclearing of various basketball<br />\nassociations to let the Europeans play, because you'd need<br />\nsome type of sanction. It'd<br />\nhave to be cleared through the<br />\nWorld Federation, through the<br />\nNCAA, the state department<br />\nand maybe even Ronnie the<br />\nHotline. Too much red tape.<br />\nWith the third idea, the problem is, most coaches want to<br />\nstart their season with cupcakes, sure wins, and don't<br />\nwant to risk a slip in the rankings or a team letdown by playing, and possibly losing to<br />\nheavyweights right out of the<br />\ngate.<br />\nBelieve me, coaches spend<br />\nmonths trying to find the<br />\nweakest teams they can play.<br />\nThey look for teams that wear<br />\nsnowshoes when they play, and<br />\nhave at least three guys that still<br />\nuse the two-hand dribble.<br />\nSo, barring a parting of the<br />\nRed Sea, it looks like March 26<br />\nand 28 will be the last two<br />\ngarden parties for the NIT. The<br />\ntide, it seems, has gone out, and<br />\nthere's no more sand in the<br />\nhourglass.<br />\n<br />\nNEWS-LETTER/19<br />\n<br />\nPkicement Bureau Interview Scheduk<br />\n3/12<br />\n<br />\nGTE-Telenet Division<br />\nUniversity of Pennsylvania MBA Program<br />\nProctor & Gamble Summer Internships<br />\n<br />\n3/13<br />\n<br />\nC&P Telephone<br />\nConDiesel Mobile Equipment Division<br />\nFMC Corp.<br />\n<br />\n3/14<br />\n<br />\nPhi Technologies<br />\nIntercad<br />\nCIA - Office of East Asia Analysis<br />\n<br />\n3/15<br />\n<br />\nMotorola<br />\nTRW<br />\nCray Research<br />\n<br />\n3/27<br />\n<br />\nEducational Resources<br />\nPeace Corps<br />\nFBI Special Agent Recruitment<br />\n<br />\n3/28<br />\n<br />\nHercules<br />\nW.W.

This race gave me a<br />\nchance to do something concrete for others,\" said David<br />\nStewart, Hopkins grad and<br />\ncoordinator of the Pablo<br />\nFargas Classic 10 Kilometer<br />\nbenefit race held 9:30 a.m. Sunday, February 26 on the Johns<br />\nHopkins campus.<br />\nStewart, the blonde and lean<br />\n24-year-old head ross country<br />\ncoach at Hopkins said, \"There<br />\nis more to me than my work.\"<br />\nHe added that his motivation to<br />\norganize the JHU Chaplain's<br />\nOffice Tutorial Program's annual race, springs from the<br />\nthree semesters he tutored 6-12<br />\nyear olds in basic math and<br />\nEnglish. \"I miss working with<br />\nyoungsters and this race keeps<br />\na tie to the program\" he said.<br />\nAlthough he finished third at<br />\n32:30 in the 1980 Fargas race,<br />\nStewart did not run Sunday.\"I<br />\njust worried,\" he commented.<br />\n\"As president of the Electric<br />\nLight Running Club, the group<br />\nthat marshalled the course, we<br />\nwere all too busy to run. We<br />\nhad to manage the 289 entrants<br />\nwho showed up for the<br />\nClassic.\"<br />\nHopkins Chaplain Chester<br />\nWickwire started the race with<br />\na wave of his hat and \"Get set.<br />\nGo,\" to the 225 men and 64<br />\nwomen runners who dashed the<br />\n6.2 mile route. Starting at<br />\nGarland Hall on a windy and<br />\nchilly day, they sprinted out to<br />\nCharles Street, north to University Parkway, then down San<br />\nMartin Drive, circling the campus three times.<br />\nThe race was divided into<br />\nfive age groups: (1) 19 and<br />\nunder,(2) 20-29,(3) 30-39,(4)<br />\n40-49,(5)50 plus, and divisions<br />\nof men and women.<br />\nMat Tobin led the pack,<br />\nfinishing at 32:45, and Julie<br />\nSmiddy flew in at 42:40 championing the women's division.<br />\nTobin, 23, also won the 1983<br />\nMaryland Marathon. Defending<br />\nAndy<br />\nchampion,<br />\nPassmore, 21, placed second at<br />\n32:52.<br />\nStewart said there were 50<br />\nHopkins participants. Julie<br />\nSmiddy, 27, is a Hopkins grad,<br />\nVivek Samnotra placed second<br />\nin the 19 and under category at<br />\n36:58, and Janice Brill took second (42:29) in the 20-29 age<br />\ngroup. Both the men and<br />\nwomen's junior divisions were<br />\nwon by Hopkins people:<br />\nGeorge Raiser at 36:22 and<br />\nCeci King, 44:27.<br />\nHopkins grad and present<br />\nTutorial Director, Tracy Stambaugh, said Stewart staged a<br />\nvery professional race. The runners were provided with split<br />\ntimes at various intervals\u2014at<br />\none, two, four, and six miles.<br />\n\"It is important for distance<br />\nrunners to maintain consistent<br />\nendurance,\" she said.<br />\nThe Tutorial Project depends<br />\non this race and other fundraisers for one-half of the program's annual budget. Hopkins<br />\nsupports the other half of the<br />\n25 year old project's expenses.<br />\nThe tutoring program consists of<br />\n<br />\nof 100 volunteers, many<br />\nHopkins stuaents, tutoring 100<br />\ninner-city children on a one-toone basis.<br />\nAsked about the race's<br />\nname, \"Pablo Fargas,\" Stambaugh said, \"You might think<br />\nhe is a famous Spanish<br />\nmarathoner or an Italian<br />\nbaseball player. Not at all. In<br />\n1980 the Chaplain's Office<br />\nwanted to give the race a title.<br />\nTen year-old Pablo Fargas'<br />\nname was picked from a hat<br />\nfull of other tutorial students'<br />\nnames.\"<br />\nStanbaugh said his full name<br />\nis Pablo Vizcarronda Fargas.<br />\nHis father is Puerto Rican, and<br />\nPablo is one of eight children.<br />\n\"He was a nice, polite, shy boy<br />\nwith a big bright smile,\" she<br />\nsaid.<br />\nA former tutor, Stewart<br />\nremembers the constant anxiety over funding. As a member<br />\n<br />\nof the Electric Light Running<br />\nClub, he knew that the club<br />\nwanted to sponsor a benefit<br />\nrace on July 4, 1980. Now the<br />\nrace has become an annual<br />\nfundraiser.<br />\nThe Running Club consists<br />\nof 30 athletes, generally in their<br />\nmiddle to late 20s. \"Running is<br />\na lonely sport, and we enjoy<br />\ncompeting with others,\"<br />\nStewart said.<br />\nOverall, the race was successful, he noted, although the<br />\nwind slowed the runners down.<br />\nEntry fees were $4 and $5.<br />\nAfter expenses, Stewart said he<br />\nexpects to net $400.<br />\nThe premiums included<br />\nblack knit caps for each participant, donated by Sunny<br />\nSurplus. Hopkins sweatshirts<br />\nwere given by Barnes and Noble to the male and female<br />\noverall winners, who also<br />\nreceived separate plaques.<br />\n<br />\nRefreshments, orange juice,<br />\ncoffee, and doughnuts were arranged by ARA.<br />\nWill he do it again next year?<br />\n\"Tentatively, yes,\" Stewart<br />\nsaid, \"but I want to see some<br />\nimprovements\u2014better outside<br />\nsponsorship, more profitability, and additional premiums. A<br />\nbig complaint was for an improved course. Racers don't<br />\nlike to repeat on a run,\"<br />\nStewart said. \"And we are professional runners.

Young stars like Darryl<br />\nStrawberry, Ron Darling, and<br />\nJesse Orosco aside, I'd give<br />\nthem half a chance if I knew<br />\nwho is going to be their 2nd<br />\nbaseman, shortstop, catcher, or<br />\nstarting pitching staff for that<br />\nmatter.<br />\nUnlike the American League<br />\nWest where there is one super<br />\nclub and a cast of also-rans, the<br />\n,N.L. West is made up of a full<br />\ngroup of contenders. The team<br />\nto beat in this division, appears<br />\nto be the team to beat in the<br />\nNational League\u2014none other<br />\nthan the L.A. Dodgers. Forget<br />\nSteve \"Whitey\" Howe and<br />\nDusty Baker, this team has the<br />\ndepth to win without them.<br />\nBy August as many as five<br />\nteams could be in contention<br />\nfor the division crown. At the<br />\nhead of that class should be the<br />\nHouston Astros. With a speedy<br />\nlineup, featuring shortstop<br />\nDickie Thon, and an excellent<br />\npitching staff, this team is<br />\ntailor-made for the Astrodome.<br />\nAnother team that is wellsuited to its park are the Atlanta Braves. The Braves rely on<br />\nheavy hitters Horner, Murphy,<br />\n<br />\nand Chambliss to rocket the<br />\nball out of the launching pad at<br />\nAtlanta's Fulton County<br />\nStadium. A thin starting staff,<br />\nand little depth, will do the<br />\nBraves in.<br />\nAs for California's other two<br />\nN.L. Teams, the San 13:ego<br />\nPadres and the San Francisco<br />\nGiants, success could also well<br />\nbe at hand. The addition of<br />\nGossage to San Diego's relief<br />\ncore should help out<br />\nsignificantly. Combining with<br />\nLuis DeLeon it appears that<br />\nPadre starters may only have to<br />\npitch five innings a game. From<br />\nthe looks of their starters<br />\nthough, it is doubtful that any<br />\none of them can do that<br />\neffectively.<br />\nThe Giants are not a bad<br />\nteam, and may surprise many<br />\npeople\u2014myself Licluded. With<br />\nAl Oliver, Jack Clark, Manny<br />\nTrillo, a solid bullpen, and a<br />\ngood manager in Frank Robinson, this team may go quite<br />\nfar\u2014then again they probably<br />\nwon't.<br />\nThe Cincinnati Reds are a<br />\nsurefire bet to finish in the<br />\ncellar. They acquired Tony<br />\nPerez in the off-season, and<br />\nironically he was the first one<br />\ngone in the dismantling of the<br />\n\"Big Red Machine\". The \"Little Reds\" have little to scare<br />\nrivals with other than fireballer<br />\nMarlo Soto. It is a shame he<br />\ndoesn't play for a winner or he<br />\ncould win twenty five games a<br />\nseason.<br />\nThat's how the chips will fall<br />\nin '84.<br />\n<br />\nRichard L.

We agree<br />\nwith the many criticisms of the<br />\nprocess by which the seals are<br />\nawarded and feel that the best<br />\nway to truly recognize accomplishment is to leave the<br />\ndecision to the senior class.<br />\nWe feel the best way to proceed is to require all students<br />\nwho wish to be considered to<br />\nsubmit to the senior class officers a standard application<br />\nwhich includes an essay describing the student's activities. To<br />\navoid a massive influx of candidates, specific prerequisites<br />\nshould be included; one possible example is at least two years<br />\nof active participation in a student group or a Student Council committee. In addition, we<br />\nfeel that activity in a fraternity<br /><br />\nor sorority should be considered on equal footing with<br />\nactivity in a studetn group. By<br />\nusing this process, each student<br />\nhas the opportunity to present<br />\nhis credentials and thus<br />\neliminate the possibility of being overlooked.<br />\nWe also agree with the contention that the large number of<br />\nSAC seals reduces the<br />\nsignificance of the award. To<br />\nrectify the situation, one of two<br />\noptions should be considered:<br />\nlimiting once again the number<br />\nof seals to 25, or, as Maureen<br />\nsuggested, instituting a twotiered system where a very small<br />\nnumber of special awards will<br />\nbe given to those with exceptional contributions to student<br />\nlife and a larger number of seals<br />\nwill be given to those with<br />\nnoteworthy contributions.<br />\nIn short, we feel the current<br />\nsystem of awarding SAC seals<br />\nis inadequate and misrepresentative. A new process should be<br />\ninstituted to make these awards<br />\nmore meaningful.<br /><br />\nWho's Telling the Truth?<br />\nTo the Editor:<br /><br />\nI read last week's NewsLetter article on Campus<br />\nSecurity with both anger and<br />\ndisappointment. The NewsLetter and reporter Bruce<br />\nAlpert abandoned the journalistic responsibility for acblatantly<br />\ncuracy<br />\nand<br />\nmisrepresented<br />\nJessica<br />\nHalprin's version of the security incident of January 17 to the<br />\ndetriment of efforts to improve<br />\nsecurity in the Hopkins<br />\ncommunity.<br />\nAccording to the article,<br />\nHalprin says she was offered a<br />\nfoot escort by the officer in<br />\ncharge of that night's shift. The<br />\narticle then implies that she<br />\nrefused the offer. Precisely the<br />\nopposite is true. As clearly<br />\nstated in her letter of February<br />\n17, \"I then demanded that they<br />\nsend someone on foot to escort<br />\nme home, which was immediately refused with no explanation whatsoever.\" These<br />\nScott Schmitt two versions are completely<br />\nLaury Hutt contradictory, Alpert's incor-<br /><br />\nrect account effectively undermining Ms. Halprin's charges<br />\nagainst Security. At minimum<br />\nAlpert and the News-Letter owe<br />\nher a public apology. The rest<br />\nof the article displays a similar<br />\nuncritical acceptance of Major<br />\nLarkin's version of the<br />\nincident.<br />\nI have no doubts about the<br />\naccuracy of Halprin's account.<br />\n' I have known her for many<br />\nyears and she is a scrupulously<br />\nhonest person. In fact, I was in<br />\nthe library the night in question<br />\nand can vouch for much of her<br />\nstory. Besides, Major Larkin's<br />\nversion is implausible: someone<br />\nconcerned about possible attack<br />\nwould not refuse the one safe<br />\nalternative\u2014an escort\u2014if<br />\noffered.<br />\nMy suspicion about Major<br />\nLarkin's account is heightened<br />\nby the knowledge that this<br />\nwould not be the first time that<br />\nCampus Security has refused to<br />\nescort female students. I know<br />\nof several instances in which<br />\nCampus Security refused to<br />\nfulfill their obligation to provide publicly offered escort services. Rather than an isolated<br /><br />\nincident, the events of January<br />\nare a generic case. Someone in<br />\nCampus Security is not telling<br />\nthe truth, and it is the women<br />\nof this University who are paying the price. The bottom line<br />\nis that Campus Security is either<br />\nunwilling or unable to meet<br />\ntheir responsibilities to the<br />\nHopkins community.<br />\nThe incident of January 17<br />\nhad a happy ending\u2014Ms.<br />\nHalprin found a ride home.

The course is divided<br />\ninto two time periods. Each<br />\nweek, a guest speaker from the<br />\ndiscipline being studied lectures<br />\nand answers questions during a<br />\ntwo-hour class.

Each lecturer represents the highest level<br />\nof scholarly research in their<br />\nfields. Not surprisingly, each<br />\nlecture attracts several of<br />\nHopkins faculty members who<br />\naudit the class. It is the<br />\nstudents, however, not the<br />\nfaculty, with whom the lecturers are impressed. Many<br />\nspeakers have commented that<br />\nthey are pleasantly surprised<br />\nwith the depth and intelligence<br />\nof students' questions and their<br />\ninterest in the subject matter.<br />\nBecause of the controversial<br />\nnature of the material presented<br />\nin this course, a one-hour section is held following each lecture. The section is used to<br />\ndiscuss assigned readings, lecture material, or anything<br />\nweighing on peoples' minds.<br />\nThe time in section is usually<br />\nspent in heated debate. Sarah<br />\nBegus says that the section is<br />\nessential because you can't give<br />\nstudents controversial material<br />\nwhich radically alters their accepted assumptions and not<br />\ngive them time to talk about it.<br />\nFor example, discussions have<br />\ncentered around women's participation in the labor force.<br />\nSuch notions as comparable<br />\npay for comparable worth and<br />\nchanging traditional family<br />\nroles reflected in labor force<br />\nparticipation have been<br />\naddressed.<br />\nWhile sitting in on \"Women<br /><br />\nin History, Culture and Society\", many things become evident. The first is that enthusiasm for the subject, so rare<br />\namong Hopkins faculty, exudes<br />\nfrom Sarah Begus and Emily<br />\nMartin who have undertaken<br />\nthe task of teaching the course.<br />\nThe second thing is the quality<br />\nof scholarly research presented.<br />\nHopkins students have the unique opportunity to become acquainted with research which is<br />\nnow seen as central for an<br />\nunderstanding of social science<br />\ndisciplines. Third, one sees the<br />\npopular and genuine support of<br />\nthe student body for such<br />\ncourses. Rarely do 50 men and<br />\nwomen register for a new non<br />\ncore-curriculum course. This<br />\ncertainly is a strong statement<br />\nattesting that the time for such<br />\ncourses on a permanent basis<br />\nhas come.<br />\nIn the past, Hopkins has offered courses dealing with<br />\nscholarship on women on a<br />\ndepartmental level. These<br />\ncourses, however, have unfortunately been the exception, not<br />\nthe rule. Interestingly, all major research universities including Harvard, Yale,<br />\nPrinceton, University of Pennsylvania, Duke(the list goes on)<br />\nhave active women's studies<br />\nprograms that offer courses<br />\nessential to undergraduate<br />\neducation as a whole. The success of this course proves that<br />\nJohns Hopkins should follow<br />\nsuit.<br />\n\"Women in History, Culture<br />\nand Society\" and the professors,<br />\ninvolved in it represent quality<br />\neducation at its finest.

The Center<br />\nhas three main areas of concentration: research, public service, and education.<br />\nIn conjunction with the<br />\nCenter's interest in international urban planning, Hopkins<br />\nhas established an urban studies<br />\ncenter in Lille, France. On<br />\nSeptember 21, 1983, Hopkins<br />\nPresident, Steven Muller, and<br />\nPresident of the Nord-Pas de<br />\nCalais Regional Council, Noel<br />\nJosephe, signed a cooperative<br />\nagreement for the establishment<br />\nof a University center for the<br />\nstudy of regional planning. The<br />\nobjectives of this new center are<br />\nto develop joint research with<br />\nFrench and European counterparts, to accommodate<br />\nmeetings and conferences on<br />\nsubjects of common interest to<br />\nthe Europeans and Americans,<br />\nand to train professionals and<br />\nadministrators in the issues confronting old industrial areas in<br />\ntheir transformation to more<br />\nmodern economic activities.<br />\n1 The center will be financed<br />\njointly by Johns Hopkins and<br />\nthe Region, and by research<br />\ngrants. The Metro Center at<br />\nHopkins has long been committed to comparative international research and study. Lille,<br />\nin the northeast of Europe, is<br />\neasily accessible to Belgium,<br />\nGermany, the Netherlands, and<br />\nEngland.

In<br />\n1857, a well known Baltimore merchant, George<br />\nPeabody, desiring to hasten the city's cultural development, proposed the establishment of an educational<br />\ninstitution consisting of a Library, Art Gallery,<br />\nAcademy of Music, and Lecture Series. The first<br />\nbuilding, housing the Conservatory, was completed in<br />\n1861, but dedication was delayed another five years<br />\nbecause of the Civil War. The Conservatory commenced formal instruction in 1868, with 148 students.<br />\nOver the next century, Peabody continued to grow<br />\nin both size and prestige, adding significantly to the<br />\ncultural life of Baltimore. Many great works of music<br />\nreceived their area premieres at Peabody, and the Institute played a major role in the establishment of the<br />\nBaltimore Symphony Orchestra. Today, there remain<br />\nclose ties between the two, with over one-third of the<br />\nof Orchestra's members being Peabody faculty.<br />\nIn 1977, financial considerations resulted in the formal affiliation of the Peabody Institute with the Johns<br />\nHopkins University. The formal relationship of the<br /><br />\nBill Meeker<br /><br />\nA Pseudo-Greek statue adorning the inside of Peabody.<br /><br />\ntwo schools has a strong historical precedent. Not only<br />\nhave Hopkins and Peabody often cooperated in<br />\nacademic ventures for many years, but their respective founders, George Peabody and Johns Hopkins,<br />\nwere close friends. Peabody once referred to Hopkins<br />\nas \"the only man more thoroughly anxious to make<br />\nmoney than myself.\" Much of Hopkins' inspiration<br />\nin endowing the school and hospital which bear his<br />\nname is said to have come from Peabody.<br />\nToday, the Peabody Conservatory enrolls about 500<br />\nstudents pursuing undergraduate, graduate, and<br />\nspecial degrees in various musical fields. They have<br />\ncome to Peabody from all over the United States and<br />\nseveral foreign countries, drawn by Peabody's tremendous reputation for excellence in musical education.<br />\nPeabody graduates are represented among the ranks<br />\nof the finest orchestras and opera companies in the<br /><br />\nLarry Volz<br /><br />\ncountry. The school's commitment to providing a level<br />\nof culture to the city of Baltimore remains unabated,<br />\nwith the Conservatory acting, in the words of one student, as a \"direct feeder into the Baltimore Opera<br />\nCompany and Symphony Orchestra.\"<br />\nAt first glance, Peabody would seem to represent<br />\na radically different side of the Johns Hopkins family. But talk to a Peabody student, and you will soon<br />\nfind that the Conservatory and Homewood share<br />\nmuch more than just a formal University affiliation.<br />\nPeabody students express many of the same concerns<br />\nabout their school and student life that are so often<br />\nheard here at Homewood.<br />\nLike other Hopkins institutions, Peabody has a well<br />\ndeserved reputation for academic pressure that seems<br />\nalmost a component part of the high level of academic<br />\nexcellence at the school. Just as Hopkins students must<br />\nsqueeze extra hours out of each day to complete an<br />\nOrgo lab or History paper, so do Peabody students<br />\nfind their time far too insufficient for the amount of<br />\npractice, performance, and ensemble work they are expected to complete. Students mentioned two main problems stemming from this pressure which will be all<br />\ntoo familiar to the Homewood undergraduate.<br />\nBecause of the limited number of top places in orchestras, opera companies, and such, there often<br />\ndevelops extreme competition between students. The<br />\nHopkins pre-med may be surprised to learn that<br />\nthroats exist among music students. But while there<br />\nis no mutilation of lab results, there is a problem of<br />\nsome students hogging precious practice rooms. Mary<br />\nCarole Brown, now a senior Natural Sciences major,<br />\ntransferred to Hopkins after two years as a trumpet<br />\nmajor at Peabody. Brown says that while she was at<br />\nthe Conservatory, she often saw students \"cheer\"<br />\nwhen one of their fellows made a mistake in a difficult<br />\npassage. The general attitude, as Brown saw it, was<br />\nthat the other students represented too great a tnreat<br />\nto risk helping someone improve his skills.<br />\nMost at Peabody, however, do not feel that the<br />\nsituation is so extreme. \"Our careers as musicians will<br />\nbe oriented towards a group function,\" says Marci<br />\nPlait, a graduate student in voice. She finds that most<br />\nstudents are willing to work together, and notes that<br />\nensemble requirements make some group effort<br />\nunavoidable.<br />\nAlso stemming from the severe time demands is the<br />\nlack of a strong student social life pointed to any<br />\nPeabody students. Their complaints sound iike an echo<br />\nof the continual griping of Homewoodians about the<br />\nnon-existant social life at Hopkins. Mark Paris, the<br />\nPresident of Peabody's Student Council, points out<br />\nthat the entire budget for student activities at the Conservatory is $5000, or about $10 per student. Compare<br />\nthat to the SAC budget at Hopkins and you can begin<br />\nto imagine the seriousness of the problem.<br />\nThe quality of teaching and the attitude of Professors towards students is yet another theme which<br />\nis common to both divisions. According to Tom Arnold, a voice student, the Conservatory suffers from<br />\n\"the misconception that a good performer is necessarily a good teacher.\" Paris agrees, saying that it is<br />\n\"risky\" to have musicians who are adept at the skill<br />\nof playing an instrument teaching courses not concerned with technical proficiency. While the students agree<br />\nthat the Peabody faculty abounds in excellent musicians, they feel that it includes too few excellent<br />\nteachers.<br /><br />\nPart of the blame, says Plait, is attributable to the<br />\nlack of any system of evaluation by students of<br />\nteachers. This problem has been addressed by the Student Council, which recently initiated course evaluations similar to those used by the Course Guide. So<br />\nfar, the evaluations have met with positive response<br />\nfrom students and teachers alike. Another Council<br />\nproposal, an award to be given at graduation to a<br />\nteacher selected by the students, is being considered<br />\nby the Peabody administration.<br />\nAnother difficulty that students often experience<br />\nregarding professors is their lack of availability for advising. \"Faculty participation with students,\" says<br />\nParis, \"is greatest during practice and ensemble sessions.\" Outside of the class or practice room, students<br />\nfeel, there is too little formal or informal interaction<br />\nbetween students and faculty. Many faculty members<br />\nare also professional musicians, and thus have little<br />\ntime to devote to their students.<br />\nThe very existence of the Student Council at<br />\nPeabody is tribute to the growing interest in improving student life at the Conservatory. When Mark Paris<br />\narrived at Peabody after receiving an undergraduate<br /><br />\nSpiral staircase presents aerial view of the stallaureni z<br />\ndegree in Politics from Muhlenberg, there was no Student Council and few student organizations of any<br />\nkind. \"Three years ago,\" he says, \"this place was a<br />\ndesert?' While interest among the students is still<br />\nmarginal, it is growing. The council publishes the<br />\nweekly Peabody Rag which lets members of the<br />\nPeabody community know what is going on. They<br />\nhave also instituted a Grievance Board, with Tom Arnold as chairman, to identify and attempt to resolve<br />\nstudent complaints. The Board receives complaints in<br />\nwriting and then communicates them to the appropriate administration or faculty person. In the first<br />\nmonth, the Grievance Board received six written complaints, and has received administration responses to<br />\nfour of these.<br />\nOne interesting suggestion voiced by the students is<br />\na closer tie between the students at Homewood and<br />\nthe Conservatory. Paris holds an extreme view on this<br />\nidea, expressing a desire to \"dig this whole block up<br />\nand move it up to Homewod.\" He cited the security<br />\nproblems of Peabody's campus and its isolation from<br />\nother Baltimore schools as reasons to relocate the Conservatory. However, realizing that such a solution is<br />\nmost unlikely, Paris proposes that Peabody students<br />\nmight live with students at Homewood, have some<br />\nrepresentation on the Student Council here, and participate in student activities. Others at Peabody react<br />\nfavorably to his suggestion that Conservatory students<br />\nbe welcome to join Hopkins fraternities and athletic<br />\nteams.\"We have a double bass player here who would<br />\nmake a terrific linebacker for the football team,\" says<br />\nArnold, referring to a Peabody student who has actually considered professional sports.<br />\n\"I'd like to see Peabody be the music students of<br />\nJohns Hopkins,\" says Paris. He points out that excellence in music is directly tied to excellence in other<br />\nfields around it. \"You have to be able to think before<br />\nyou can be a musician.\"<br />\nAnd the music students would not be the only ones<br />\nwho could profit from such ties. Who knows, that guy<br />\nnext to you in Orgo lab may be the next Pablo Casals<br />\njust waiting to be uncovered.<br /><br />\n\u2022<br /><br />\nSports<br />\nHOPKINSLACROSSE:The New Era Begins<br />\nby Bill Bernstein<br />\nWhen Don Zimmerman was named head lacrosse<br />\ncoach last October, he attained his life-long ambition.<br />\nZimmerman succeeded nine-year veteran Henry Ciccarone, who retired from coaching in order to pursue<br />\na career in business. 1984, then, will mark the beginning of a new era in Blue Jay lacrosse.<br />\nComing off a 12-2 1983 season, including a 17-16<br />\nNCAA Division I Championship Game loss to<br />\nSyracuse, second-ranked Hopkins will open the 1984<br />\nlacrosse season tomorrow when they host UMBC at<br />\n2:00 p.m.(WJHU, 88.1 FM).<br />\nUnder Ciccarone, the Blue Jays compiled an overall<br />\nrecord of 105-16 and won three national championships. Zimmerman, who was an honorable mention<br />\nAll-America midfielder at Hopkins in 1975, began<br />\nhis varsity coaching career at Princeton. He then spent<br />\nfour years as offensive coordinator on Willie Scroggs'<br />\nNorth Carolina coaching staff before returning to<br />\nHomewood in 1983. During Zimmerman's stint at<br />\nCarolina, the Tar Heels won two national<br />\nchampionships.<br />\nLast season, Zimmerman served as Ciccarone's chief<br />\nassistant, as the Blue Jays reached the NCAA finals<br />\nfor the seventh straight year. In what was perhaps one<br />\nof the most exciting lacrosse games ever played, 17,000<br />\nspectators watched Hopkins jump out to a 12-5 lead<br />\nbefore Syracuse staged an incredible comeback in the<br />\ngame's final 22 minutes.<br />\nAfter Jay defender Marty Bergin left the game with<br />\nan injury, the Hopkins defense broke down. Syracuse<br />\noutscored the Blue Jays 10-3 in the final 17 minutes<br />\nto capture their first championship since 1924.<br />\n\"It was the hardest loss of my life,\" said senior captain Willy Odenthal. \"I'm glad we learned from it.<br />\nYou can never let up.\"<br />\n1983 NCAA Division<br />\nFinal Lacrosse Rankings<br />\nNo.<br />\n,1<br />\n2<br />\n3<br />\n4<br />\n5<br />\n6<br />\n7<br />\n8<br /><br />\nSchool<br />\nSyracuse<br />\nJohns Hopkins<br />\nVirginia<br />\nArmy<br />\nNorth Carolina<br />\nMaryland<br />\nPenn<br />\nCornell<br /><br />\nRecord<br />\n14-1<br />\n12-2<br />\n10-2<br />\n11-3<br />\n9-4<br />\n9-5<br />\n10-3<br />\n8-4<br /><br />\n\"I thought we did very well last year,\" Zimmerman<br />\nsaid. \"With what we had, 1983's team went as far as<br />\nit could go. I was very proud of their performance.<br />\nThis season, I think we're stronger in the attack. Give<br />\nus time, and we'll be as strong in the midfield as<br />\ndefense. We'll take it one game at a time and see how<br />\nwe develop.\"<br />\nOn attack, the Jays lost Rob Lord and Gary Benninghoff to graduation. They should be easily replaced<br />\nwith three lettermen returning to the attack unit: captain Odenthal, honorable mention All-American Peter<br />\nScott, and senior Brent Ciccarone.<br />\nOdenthal was elected captain \"out of respect for his<br />\ndesire, attitude, and ability. He's doing an outstanding job,\" said Zimmerman.<br />\n\"The team has a great attitude this year. It's a<br />\nclosely knit team, and there's as much talent or more<br />\non this club than on any since my freshman year,\"<br />\nOdenthal said. \"I'm trying to stay as tight as I can<br />\nwith the players. We've been working especially hard<br />\nthis year to get that little extra that it's going to take<br />\nto win the championship.\"<br />\nIn addition to the three returning seniors, transfer<br />\nGeoff Nordberg, along with freshmen Brian Wood<br />\nand Craig Bubier should contribute to make the Blue<br />\nJay attack one of the most powerful units in the<br />\nnation.<br />\n\"We certainly have much more depth than last year.<br />\nWe'll get more production out of this year's attack as<br />\ncompared to last season's,\" the coach said.<br />\nWood, who scored seven goals in a scrimmage<br />\nagainst Delaware, will start with Scott and Odenthal.<br />\nCiccarone will share the crease responsibilities with<br />\nOdenthal.<br />\nAlthough the Jays graduated two All-America midfielders in 1983, Hopkins has another pair of AllAmerica middies returning. First team All-American<br />\nDel Dressel and third team All-American John<br /><br />\nKrumenacker should fill the void left by the departures<br />\nof Bill Cantelli and Henry Ciccarone, Jr.<br />\n\"It looks really promising,\" noted Dressel. \"We<br />\nhave a lot of unselfish players on offense, all of whom<br />\nare capable of scoring three goals on a given day.\"<br />\nAlso returning on the midfield are senior Rich Glancy, juniors Lee Davidson and Greg Matthews, and<br />\nsophomore Chris Schreiber. Joining these veterans are<br />\nfreshmen Bruce Chanenchuk, Tom Engelke and Jack<br />\nCrawford and transfers John Tucker, Dave Castle,<br />\nGlenn Fik:ge and Steve Mutscheller.<br />\n\"We ha-.'e some very experienced midfielders returning, and we brought in some nice players to complement them,\" Zimmerman added.<br />\nAll-Americans Dressel and Krumenacker will be<br />\nplaced on the same line this season. Along with<br />\nfreshman Chanenchuk, they will man the first line.<br />\nThis combination gives us a real potent first midfield,\" said Zimmerman.<br />\nTucker will head up the second line, teaming with<br />\nGlancy and Engelke. Schreiber, Mutscheller and Castle will staff the third line.<br />\nFidge will take faceoffs with the first unit, Matthews<br />\nwith the second, and Davison with the third.<br />\nMatthews will handle the opening faceoff in tomorrow's game, according to the coach.<br />\n\"It's a very competitive atmosphere for midfield<br />\npositions,\" Zimmerman said. \"This is going to make<br />\nus a stronger team. If guys aren't producing, there are<br />\nother people waiting to step in.\"<br />\n\"It's a healthy competition,\" agreed Dressel.<br />\n\"Coach Zimmerman is stressing that everyone is going to have a role. This is a strong point in being a<br />\nclose team.\"<br />\nThe laxers do not appear to be quite as strong in<br />\nthe defense as they are in the midfield. Last year's<br />\ntough defensive unit, led by now graduated Bergin and<br />\nJim Esposito, will be hard to duplicate.<br />\nHopkins has only one defensive starter returning\u2014<br />\nJohn DeTommaso. Although hampered in the<br />\npreseason by a torn ligament in the bottom of his foot,<br />\nDeTommaso will start tomorrow.<br />\nZimmerman said that DeTommaso, a 1983<br />\nhonorable mention All-American, is at full strength.<br />\n\"DeTommaso had a great freshman year an I expect<br />\nhim to only get better and better,\" the coach stated.<br />\nIn addition, sophomore Guy Matricciani,who was<br />\nforced to sit out last season with a broken jaw, will<br />\nstart on defense along with senior Steve Dubin.<br />\nSenior Frank DeVita and Walt Carswell, freshmen<br />\nChris Wickwire and Steve Mitchell, and sophomores<br />\nBrad McLam, Jon Krome and Dan Pallace could all<br />\nsee action on defense.<br />\nZimmerman said that he sees no weakness in the<br />\ndefense. \"Our defense needs to come together as a<br />\ncohesive unit. I'm confident, and I've been pleased<br />\nwith the way our defense has been shaping up,\" he<br />\nnoted.<br />\n1983 NCAA Division I<br />\nFirst Team All-Americans<br />\nName<br />\nTim Nelson<br />\nJim Wilkerson<br />\nFrank Giordano<br />\nPeter Voelkel<br />\nBrad Kotz<br />\nDel Dressel<br />\nBill Cantelli<br />\nSteve Byrne<br />\nBill Aliber<br />\nJeff McCormick<br />\nGeorge Slabowski<br /><br />\nSchool Position<br />\nSyracuse<br />\nMaryland<br />\nArmy<br />\nCarolina<br />\nSyracuse<br />\nHopkins<br />\nHopkins<br />\nVirginia<br />\nBrown<br />\nSyracuse<br />\nArmy<br /><br />\nA<br />\nA<br />\nA<br /><br />\n\"I think we're going to shape up as a unit,\" DeTommaso said. \"We're working hard on team defense. It's<br />\nnot three separate guys playing individual defense. Our<br />\ndefense has good movements. The three midfielders,<br />\nthree defenders, and goalie all work together as one<br />\ngroup.\"<br />\nJunior Larry Quinn will take over for graduated second team All-American Brian Holman in the goal this<br />\nyear. Quinn, who saw considerable action last season<br />\nwhen Holman injured his knee, will be backed up by<br />\njunior John Madden and freshman Stuart Jones.<br />\n\"I thought Holman was the best goalkeeper in Division I last year,\" said Zimmerman. \"Quinn could have<br />\nstarted for many teams last season. I give him a lot<br /><br />\nBill Meeker<br /><br />\nFreshmen Brian Wood and Bruce Chanenchuk<br />\nof credit for accepting his role. Now he's going to get<br />\nhis shot.\"<br />\nZimmerman cited the team's depth as the Jay's major strength, and their youth as the primary concern.<br />\n\"Last year .was a banner recruiting year for us, and<br />\nwe'll have a lot of very talented freshmen seeing playing time,\" he said.<br />\nThis will contribute to the team's inexperience, \"but<br />\nthese freshmen don't look like they're freshmen.<br />\nThey're great ballplayers,\" said Odenthal.<br />\n\"We're counting on having good leadership from<br />\nour seniors. This class has never won a national championship (the last Hopkins championship was in 1980),<br />\nand they're hungry. I hope their attitude is that they'll<br />\ndo whatever it takes to win a championship,\" the<br />\nthirty-one year old coach said.<br />\nZimmerman stated that he feels \"very comfortable\"<br />\nat the helm of the Hopkins lacrosse program. \"I know<br />\nit's a big responsibility. I feel a lot of pressure from<br />\nwithin. But I knew I would when I got into this. I just<br />\nenjoy it,\" he said.<br />\nJoe Devlin, a 1978 Hopkins graduate will join the<br />\ncoaching staff for the first time this year. Devlin, who<br />\ncoached the St. Mary's High School in Annapolis for<br />\nthe last four years, will work with the offense. Returning assistant coaches Jerry Pfeifer and Fred Smith<br />\nwill handle the defense. Dennis Townsend will work<br />\nwith the close attack, and Joe Cowan will serve as<br />\ngeneral assistant.<br />\n\"Cowan has a great knowledge and feel for the<br />\nsport. He's a tremendous game-day coach,\" noted<br />\nZimmerman. \"I'm very fortunate to have a staff of<br />\nexcellent assistant coaches.\"<br />\nThe Blue Jays defeated UMBC 15-4 last season,<br />\nand they are hoping to start off 1984 in a similar<br />\nfashion. According to Zimmerman, \"if we have the<br />\nright attitude, work hard and take each game one at<br />\na time, then I'm confident at the end we'll be right<br />\nup there.\"<br />\nThe Blue Jays have lost the last three consecutive<br />\nchampionship games by a total of four goals. As they<br />\nprogress through the 1984 season, the Hopkins players<br />\nwill always have the memory of last year's bitter 17-16<br />\nchampionship game loss to Syracuse in the back of<br />\ntheir minds. This memory should provide the inspiration necessary to recapture the national championship.<br />\n\"Any team that builds a big lead can slack off,\"<br />\nMatthews said. \"After last year, we're not going to<br />\nslack off at all.\"<br />\n\"When you come that close, it's a feeling you don't<br />\nforget,\" said Dressel.<br />\n\"We're not forgetting about it,\" DeTommaso said.<br />\n\"We're working very hard, and we're going to have<br />\nthe killer instinct.\"<br />\nThe Blue Jays players will never forget what happened to them on that sunny May afternoon in New<br />\nBrunswick last spring. And, hopefully, they will not<br />\nlet it happen again.<br />\nAs Zimmerman put it, \"that loss made us hungry.\"<br /><br />\nThe road to Delaware<br /><br />\nA Close Look at the Blue Jays' Competition<br />\nby Dave Epstein<br />\nThe 1984 lacrosse season is one of the most anticipated in recent memory.

With the NCAA going<br />\nto 64 teams next year, it would<br />\nseem to be the death knell for<br />\nthat basketball mecca called<br />\nMadison Square Garden.<br />\nThey say the beat must go on,<br />\nbut for me there's only sadness<br />\nto see the white flag go up, see<br />\nthe Goliaths finally kill David,<br />\nto watch the lights go out and<br />\nthe NIT become a part of the<br />\npast, a piece of nostalgia, like<br />\nminor league baseball, semi-pro<br />\nfootball, the nickel candy bar,<br />\nand toy soldiers made out of<br />\nlead.<br />\nEver since the NIT got its<br />\nslap on the bottom in 1938, a<br />\nyear before the NCAA saw the<br />\nlight, fans have thrilled to many<br />\ngreat moments. Like back in<br />\n1945 when Ernie Calverly made<br />\nhis shot from half-court for the<br />\nUniversity of Rhode Island, to<br />\nput the game against Bowling<br />\nGreen into overtime. Bowling<br />\nGreen went on to win that one,<br />\nbut then DePaul and coach Ray<br />\nMeyer grabbed the brass ring<br />\nby beating the Falcons, behind<br />\nGeorge Mikan, the first of the<br />\ngreat big men.<br />\nAnother memorable NIT<br />\nwould have to be 1950, when<br />\nCity College of New York<br />\nbecame the only team in college<br />\nhistory to win both the NIT and<br />\nthe NCAA in the same year.<br />\nBack in those days, you could<br />\nenter both, and Bradley University was the Beavers' victim in<br />\nthe title game both times.<br />\nOver the years, the NIT has<br />\nbeen a showcase for great<br />\nplayers, like Tommy Heinsohn,<br />\nKevin<br />\nLenny<br />\nWilkins,<br />\nLoughery, John Shumate, Gary<br />\nBrokaw and who can ever<br />\nforget Sihugo Green, who<br />\nscored 33 points in Duquesne's<br />\n1955 title victory!<br />\nPersonally, I'll never forget<br />\nwhen Southern Illinois held<br />\nGeorge (Brute Force) Thompson, Marquette's all-time<br />\nleading scorer, to 12 points and<br />\nWalt Frazier scored 21 to beat<br />\nus in the 1967 title game. And,<br />\nof course, the 1970 NIT, which<br />\nwe won, after I'd told the<br />\nNCAA to take a hike when they<br />\nsent us out of our mideast<br />\nregional to the midwest.<br />\nDuring my playing days at<br />\nSt. John's, in the early 1950's,<br />\nwe went to the NIT three times<br />\nunder Frank McGuire. Back<br />\nthen, the garden was the<br />\nZenith, Miller time, the<br />\nultimate stage for all coaches<br />\nand ballplayers to appear on.<br />\nThat's the old garden I'm talking about, on 49th St. and 8th<br />\nAve. It was the first place college basketball became big<br />\nbusiness.<br /><br />\nThere are, in my opinion,<br />\nthree ways the NIT might still<br />\nsurvive. One way they might exist is by taking eight of the 32<br />\nfirst-round losers from the<br />\nNCAA tourney each year, and<br />\nstage a shoot-out at the garden.<br />\nThere's always a number of<br />\nwild upsets in the first round,<br />\nwhich could end up being a<br />\nbonanza rather than a Dunkirk<br />\nfor the NIT.<br />\nThe only drawback is, they'd<br />\nhave to get permission from<br />\nShawnee Mission to do that,<br />\nand I'd bet the farm, Shawnee<br />\nmight be a little slow on the<br />\ndraw.<br />\nThe NIT could also consider<br />\ninviting four European teams<br />\nagainst four predominantly<br />\neastern teams to get the regional<br />\nflavor that would attract the<br />\nstudent bodies and alumni.<br />\nAgain, those four might be<br />\nschools that didn't make the<br />\nNCAA.<br />\nStart of the season, a preseason shoot-out on Thanksgiving weekend, bringing in eight<br />\npowers from<br />\ndynamite<br />\nthroughout the country, with a<br />\nlimited amount of flavor for<br />\nthe Big East television corridor<br />\nfrom Boston to Washington,<br />\nD.C.<br />\nBy doing that, it would allow<br /><br />\ncontinuity, and would keep<br />\nalive the NIT tradition that has<br />\ntruly been one of the centerpieces of collegiate basketball<br />\nfor more than 40 years.<br />\nUnless one of those three options become reality, it's taps city for the NIT. The first option<br />\nwon't happen because it would<br />\ntake away something from the<br />\nNCAA Tourney, and since<br />\nthey're in competition dollarwise and publicity-wise, it's<br />\ndoubtful the NCAA would be<br />\nthat charitable. Look for<br />\nScrooge McDuck to open his<br />\nvalue first.<br />\nThe problem with the second<br />\noption is that it would need the<br />\nclearing of various basketball<br />\nassociations to let the Europeans play, because you'd need<br />\nsome type of sanction. It'd<br />\nhave to be cleared through the<br />\nWorld Federation, through the<br />\nNCAA, the state department<br />\nand maybe even Ronnie the<br />\nHotline. Too much red tape.<br />\nWith the third idea, the problem is, most coaches want to<br />\nstart their season with cupcakes, sure wins, and don't<br />\nwant to risk a slip in the rankings or a team letdown by playing, and possibly losing to<br />\nheavyweights right out of the<br />\ngate.<br />\nBelieve me, coaches spend<br />\nmonths trying to find the<br />\nweakest teams they can play.<br />\nThey look for teams that wear<br />\nsnowshoes when they play, and<br />\nhave at least three guys that still<br />\nuse the two-hand dribble.<br />\nSo, barring a parting of the<br />\nRed Sea, it looks like March 26<br />\nand 28 will be the last two<br />\ngarden parties for the NIT.

This race gave me a<br />\nchance to do something concrete for others,\" said David<br />\nStewart, Hopkins grad and<br />\ncoordinator of the Pablo<br />\nFargas Classic 10 Kilometer<br />\nbenefit race held 9:30 a.m. Sunday, February 26 on the Johns<br />\nHopkins campus.<br />\nStewart, the blonde and lean<br />\n24-year-old head ross country<br />\ncoach at Hopkins said, \"There<br />\nis more to me than my work.\"<br />\nHe added that his motivation to<br />\norganize the JHU Chaplain's<br />\nOffice Tutorial Program's annual race, springs from the<br />\nthree semesters he tutored 6-12<br />\nyear olds in basic math and<br />\nEnglish. \"I miss working with<br />\nyoungsters and this race keeps<br />\na tie to the program\" he said.<br />\nAlthough he finished third at<br />\n32:30 in the 1980 Fargas race,<br />\nStewart did not run Sunday.\"I<br />\njust worried,\" he commented.<br />\n\"As president of the Electric<br />\nLight Running Club, the group<br />\nthat marshalled the course, we<br />\nwere all too busy to run. We<br />\nhad to manage the 289 entrants<br />\nwho showed up for the<br />\nClassic.\"<br />\nHopkins Chaplain Chester<br />\nWickwire started the race with<br />\na wave of his hat and \"Get set.<br />\nGo,\" to the 225 men and 64<br />\nwomen runners who dashed the<br />\n6.2 mile route. Starting at<br />\nGarland Hall on a windy and<br />\nchilly day, they sprinted out to<br />\nCharles Street, north to University Parkway, then down San<br />\nMartin Drive, circling the campus three times.<br />\nThe race was divided into<br />\nfive age groups: (1) 19 and<br />\nunder,(2) 20-29,(3) 30-39,(4)<br />\n40-49,(5)50 plus, and divisions<br />\nof men and women.<br />\nMat Tobin led the pack,<br />\nfinishing at 32:45, and Julie<br />\nSmiddy flew in at 42:40 championing the women's division.<br />\nTobin, 23, also won the 1983<br />\nMaryland Marathon. Defending<br />\nAndy<br />\nchampion,<br />\nPassmore, 21, placed second at<br />\n32:52.<br />\nStewart said there were 50<br />\nHopkins participants. Julie<br />\nSmiddy, 27, is a Hopkins grad,<br />\nVivek Samnotra placed second<br />\nin the 19 and under category at<br />\n36:58, and Janice Brill took second (42:29) in the 20-29 age<br />\ngroup. Both the men and<br />\nwomen's junior divisions were<br />\nwon by Hopkins people:<br />\nGeorge Raiser at 36:22 and<br />\nCeci King, 44:27.<br />\nHopkins grad and present<br />\nTutorial Director, Tracy Stambaugh, said Stewart staged a<br />\nvery professional race. The runners were provided with split<br />\ntimes at various intervals\u2014at<br />\none, two, four, and six miles.<br />\n\"It is important for distance<br />\nrunners to maintain consistent<br />\nendurance,\" she said.<br />\nThe Tutorial Project depends<br />\non this race and other fundraisers for one-half of the program's annual budget. Hopkins<br />\nsupports the other half of the<br />\n25 year old project's expenses.<br />\nThe tutoring program consists of<br /><br />\nof 100 volunteers, many<br />\nHopkins stuaents, tutoring 100<br />\ninner-city children on a one-toone basis.<br />\nAsked about the race's<br />\nname, \"Pablo Fargas,\" Stambaugh said, \"You might think<br />\nhe is a famous Spanish<br />\nmarathoner or an Italian<br />\nbaseball player. Not at all. In<br />\n1980 the Chaplain's Office<br />\nwanted to give the race a title.<br />\nTen year-old Pablo Fargas'<br />\nname was picked from a hat<br />\nfull of other tutorial students'<br />\nnames.\"<br />\nStanbaugh said his full name<br />\nis Pablo Vizcarronda Fargas.<br />\nHis father is Puerto Rican, and<br />\nPablo is one of eight children.<br />\n\"He was a nice, polite, shy boy<br />\nwith a big bright smile,\" she<br />\nsaid.<br />\nA former tutor, Stewart<br />\nremembers the constant anxiety over funding. As a member<br /><br />\nof the Electric Light Running<br />\nClub, he knew that the club<br />\nwanted to sponsor a benefit<br />\nrace on July 4, 1980. Now the<br />\nrace has become an annual<br />\nfundraiser.<br />\nThe Running Club consists<br />\nof 30 athletes, generally in their<br />\nmiddle to late 20s. \"Running is<br />\na lonely sport, and we enjoy<br />\ncompeting with others,\"<br />\nStewart said.<br />\nOverall, the race was successful, he noted, although the<br />\nwind slowed the runners down.<br />\nEntry fees were $4 and $5.<br />\nAfter expenses, Stewart said he<br />\nexpects to net $400.<br />\nThe premiums included<br />\nblack knit caps for each participant, donated by Sunny<br />\nSurplus. Hopkins sweatshirts<br />\nwere given by Barnes and Noble to the male and female<br />\noverall winners, who also<br />\nreceived separate plaques.<br /><br />\nRefreshments, orange juice,<br />\ncoffee, and doughnuts were arranged by ARA.<br />\nWill he do it again next year?<br />\n\"Tentatively, yes,\" Stewart<br />\nsaid, \"but I want to see some<br />\nimprovements\u2014better outside<br />\nsponsorship, more profitability, and additional premiums. A<br />\nbig complaint was for an improved course. Racers don't<br />\nlike to repeat on a run,\"<br />\nStewart said. \"And we are professional runners.

N.C. State will get one<br />\nof the last few bids, as the tournament committee feels a<br />\ntwinge of nostalgia allowing<br />\nthem to defend their national<br />\nchampionship.<br />\nBig East: After Patrick Ewing<br />\nand Georgetown mop the<br />\nMadison Square Garden floor<br /><br />\nwith the opposition in the Big<br />\nEast Tournament, Syracuse,<br />\nVillanova, Boston College, and<br />\neven St. John's will get NCAA<br />\nbids.<br />\nWhy so many Big East<br />\nteams? Simple\u2014people would<br />\nmuch rather watch St. John's<br />\nplay than Kansas, even though<br />\nKansas is a more deserving<br />\nteam. Don't forget that the<br />\ntournament is the NCAA's<br />\nmedia showcase\u2014and that the<br />\nNCAA will do its best to lodge<br />\nitself into the New York,<br />\nPhiladelphia and Boston television markets.<br />\nBig Eight: Oklahoma is the<br />\nclass of this conference. Kansas<br />\nand Nebraska, two good teams,<br />\nwill get caught in the numbers<br />\nrace and will be relegated to the<br />\nNIT.<br />\nBig Ten: Since the Big Ten has<br />\nno conference tournament,<br />\neither Illinois or Purdue will get<br />\nan automatic bid as conference<br />\nchampion. The loser, and In-<br /><br />\ndiana will go to the NCAA's.<br />\nMetro Seven: The conference<br />\ntournament is up for grabs between Memphis State, Louisville<br />\nand Virginia Tech, but all three<br />\nwill make the tournament.<br />\nMissouri Valley: Illinois State<br />\nand Tulsa are both good teams.<br />\nWichita State won't make it,<br />\nthough.<br />\nPacific Coast Ath. Conf.:<br />\nUNLV will run over weak opposition en route to a high<br />\nseeding.<br />\nSoutheastern: Kentucky is the<br />\nclass of the conference, but<br />\nAuburn and LSU will receive<br />\nbids.<br />\nPacific Ten: Washington and<br />\nOregon State will be a great<br />\nmatchup for the conference<br />\ntournament final. To keep<br />\nCalifornia happy, UCLA will<br />\nreceive bid number 52.<br />\nSouthwest: Houston will be the<br />\ntop seed in one regional, with<br />\nArkansas on their backs as conference runner-up.

DePaul should be the only independent in the NCAA's.<br />\nNotre Dame, Stretson, Dayton<br />\nand Marquette simply have too<br />\nmany losses.<br />\nOther Conferences: These pro-<br /><br />\nbable conference champions<br />\nwill get bids: Atlantic-10: Temple and St. Joseph's (neither<br />\ncan be ignored).

Young stars like Darryl<br />\nStrawberry, Ron Darling, and<br />\nJesse Orosco aside, I'd give<br />\nthem half a chance if I knew<br />\nwho is going to be their 2nd<br />\nbaseman, shortstop, catcher, or<br />\nstarting pitching staff for that<br />\nmatter.<br />\nUnlike the American League<br />\nWest where there is one super<br />\nclub and a cast of also-rans, the<br />\n,N.L. West is made up of a full<br />\ngroup of contenders. The team<br />\nto beat in this division, appears<br />\nto be the team to beat in the<br />\nNational League\u2014none other<br />\nthan the L.A. Dodgers. Forget<br />\nSteve \"Whitey\" Howe and<br />\nDusty Baker, this team has the<br />\ndepth to win without them.<br />\nBy August as many as five<br />\nteams could be in contention<br />\nfor the division crown. At the<br />\nhead of that class should be the<br />\nHouston Astros. With a speedy<br />\nlineup, featuring shortstop<br />\nDickie Thon, and an excellent<br />\npitching staff, this team is<br />\ntailor-made for the Astrodome.<br />\nAnother team that is wellsuited to its park are the Atlanta Braves. The Braves rely on<br />\nheavy hitters Horner, Murphy,<br /><br />\nand Chambliss to rocket the<br />\nball out of the launching pad at<br />\nAtlanta's Fulton County<br />\nStadium. A thin starting staff,<br />\nand little depth, will do the<br />\nBraves in.<br />\nAs for California's other two<br />\nN.L. Teams, the San 13:ego<br />\nPadres and the San Francisco<br />\nGiants, success could also well<br />\nbe at hand. The addition of<br />\nGossage to San Diego's relief<br />\ncore should help out<br />\nsignificantly. Combining with<br />\nLuis DeLeon it appears that<br />\nPadre starters may only have to<br />\npitch five innings a game. From<br />\nthe looks of their starters<br />\nthough, it is doubtful that any<br />\none of them can do that<br />\neffectively.<br />\nThe Giants are not a bad<br />\nteam, and may surprise many<br />\npeople\u2014myself Licluded. With<br />\nAl Oliver, Jack Clark, Manny<br />\nTrillo, a solid bullpen, and a<br />\ngood manager in Frank Robinson, this team may go quite<br />\nfar\u2014then again they probably<br />\nwon't.<br />\nThe Cincinnati Reds are a<br />\nsurefire bet to finish in the<br />\ncellar. They acquired Tony<br />\nPerez in the off-season, and<br />\nironically he was the first one<br />\ngone in the dismantling of the<br />\n\"Big Red Machine\". The \"Little Reds\" have little to scare<br />\nrivals with other than fireballer<br />\nMarlo Soto. It is a shame he<br />\ndoesn't play for a winner or he<br />\ncould win twenty five games a<br />\nseason.<br />\nThat's how the chips will fall<br />\nin '84.<br /><br />\nRichard L.
