Furthermore, the professor, who is<br />\n51, has recently started his second term on the 13altimor<br />\nCity Board of Education.<br />\nBorn ,and raised in Oberlin, Ohio, Dr. Scott went to<br />\nOberlin College and received his Ph.D. at Hopkins: \"Like<br />\nmost blacks, I viewed education as a means to an end, the<br />\nend being getting a job -- so I figured if I could major in<br />\nthe most difficult course in the curriculum I could get a<br />\njob. The most difficult course was physics, so I majored in<br />\nphysics in college and got a Master's degree in it, and for<br />\nme the most difficult part of physics was fluid dynamics,<br />\nso I got a Ph. D. in that.\"<br />\nBefore arriving at Johns Hopkins, Professor Scott<br />\ntaught at several state colleges and, as a result, his opinion<br />\nof the students here is high: \"I've spent a lot of time<br />\nteaching in state institutions, schools where if you<br />\ngraduated from high school you could get admitted. I've<br />\nhad students in the college classes who couldn't read or<br />\nwrite; so I am tremendously impressed with the Hopkins'<br />\nstudents, maybe too impressed, because of my having<br />\ntaught so much in the other schools. The students here<br />\nare outstanding.\"<br />\nMany of the non science-oriented students here are<br />\nfamiliar with Dr. Scott through his teaching of the<br />\nintroductory ..course, Astronomy and the Solar System.<br />\n(Commonly called Astrogut.) According to the Professor,<br />\nhis interest in astronomy was not accidental, but instead<br />\nresulted from his previous work in fluid dynamics: \"The<br />\ncore of the earth and some of the other planets is fluid,<br />\nand it is those fluid dynamical processes that give rise, so<br />\nthe theory says, to the magnetic fields of the earth and<br />\nthe planets. So I had a chance to apply my knowledge of<br />\nfluid dynamics to an astronomical problem, and thus I<br />\nbecame interested in astronomy.\"<br />\n<br />\nHowever, because Dr. Scott employs a flamboyant<br />\nlecture style and is prone to the unearthing of<br />\nlittle-known iaformation, wary students often question<br />\nthe factual basis of the lectures. To these complaints the<br />\nProfessor replies: \"I have read, I think, every astronomy<br />\ntext in existence, and with that kind of background it is<br />\nwry easy to prepare the kind of lectures that I do.\"<br />\n<br />\nProfessor Scott finds satisfaction in helping to formulate<br />\nthe policies of the Baltimoe City School Board, a body to<br />\nwhich he was recently renominated. by Mayor Schaefer.<br />\nThe Board, however, far from ensuring that the public<br />\nschools are as good as they can be, has had difficulties<br />\nmaintaining high standards of excellence in education in<br />\n<br />\nrecent years.<br />\n\"No, the schools are not as good as they should be, but<br />\nthis Board is going to make them better,\" declared Dr.<br />\nScott. \"I think that I helped change the Board's thinking<br />\n.-- that we should return to the basics in education. Let's<br />\nemphasize the fact that the youngsters must learn to read<br />\nand write -- that wasn't the emphasis four or five years<br />\nago.\"<br />\nDr. Scott's concern for education is by no means<br />\nlimited to the Board, for he has been active in attempts to<br />\nexpand and diversify the educational opportunities at<br />\nHopkins. Despite these efforts, he still feels that many of<br />\nthe students do not ta c advantage of the widening<br />\ncurriculum.<br />\n\"I am somewhat concerned with the tendency of the<br />\nstudents to specialize, hut that may be necessary. I do<br />\nthink the students could be a little more well-rounded<br />\nthan they are, but that's going to require more time, and<br />\nthe time is not available.<br />\n\"I did agree sonic years ago with the student<br />\ncontention that the undergraduate program As not-as<br />\nbroad as it should have been, but there's been a lot of<br />\nimprovement in that area and maybe we can see some<br />\nmore. That is, there weren't enough courses being offered,<br />\non the undergraduate level. There are more now, but I am<br />\nnot-quite sure if there are enough.\"<br />\nOf course, Professor Scott realizes that mere expansion<br />\nof the undergraduate curriculum will not guarantee<br />\nwell-rounded students, and that .the ultimate aim of the<br />\nbulk of the students to reach graduate schools limits the<br />\nvariety of courses one can take. \"I think the solution is<br />\ngoing to lie with the medical schools and the graduate<br />\nschools, and as long as spaces are limited, you're going to<br />\nhave to have this kind of competition.\"<br />\nAlthough these conditions may be harmful in some<br />\nrespects, Professor Scott feels that, overall, receiving one's<br />\neducation at Hopkins is a worthwhile experience. \"I think<br />\nwe are producing well-educated graduates. I believe the<br />\ngraduate here knows something when he le;ivcs. The goal<br />\nof Hopkins is what it has always been, and that is to make<br />\na contribution to society -- Hopkins has done that and iF<br />\ncontinuing to do that.\"<br />\n<br />\nINSIDE THIS ISSUE<br />\nAdministrators do theVarsity Rag p.3<br />\nChesanow's Declaration of Principles p.6<br />\n<br />\n\fpage 2/news-letter/april 19, 1977<br />\nThe Clydesdale horses will appear at the Johns Hopkins<br />\nHospital May 13 and volunteers are needed to solicit the crowds<br />\nfor donations.

It can get boring while still in a transitional stage,<br />\neven if your pension is near the hundred grand mark and a<br />\nton of golfing invitations flood your Secret<br />\nService-protected office every day.<br />\nFor Gerry Ford, the answer to escape that boredom is<br />\nto hit the always lucrative lecture circuit. Ford has kicked<br />\noff his series of \"informal\" visits to college campuses<br />\naround the country w ith a stop at his alma mater, Yale<br />\nUniversity. He had started his law studies there 42<br />\nyears-ago after a fair-to-middling scholastic record and a<br />\ndistinguished football career at the University of<br />\nMichigan. At Yale he coached the football team and<br />\neventually talked his way into the law school.<br />\nFord spoke to several classes, touching upon a wide<br />\nrange of topics with a guarded opinion. He said that one,<br />\nof his more regrettable decisions as president was not to<br />\ninvite the Russian dissident-exile, Aleksandr I.<br />\nSolzhenitsyn, to the White House in 1975.<br />\nTo further ease his retirement days, Ford has also been<br />\nappointed as an adjunct professor of political science at<br />\nthe U. of Michigan for the next winter term. He'll be on<br />\nthat campus for one or twol tek periods this calendar<br />\nyear while his teaching schedule is being worked out on a<br />\nmore permanent basis.

Of five existing vicepresidencies, one will be created, three will undergo<br />\nchanges in both title and function, and one will remain<br />\nbasically unchanged.<br />\nThe vice presidencies for the Homewood and Health<br />\nDivisions (Dr. George S. Benton and Dr. Richard S. Ross)<br />\nare being discontinued. The Provost (Dr. Richard<br />\nLongaker) will assume the acade,mic functions previously<br />\nperformed by these two vice-presidencies, including<br />\nsupervision of the MSE Library and the Dean of Students<br />\nOffice. On the organizational chart, the Deans at<br />\nHomewood, SAIS, and East Baltimore will be directly<br />\nresponsible to the Provost rather than these two<br />\nvice-presidencies as they were in the past.<br />\nAdministrative duties performed by these two positions<br />\nwill be transferred to the newly created vice-president for<br />\nAdministrative Services. No candidate has yet been<br />\nselected to fill this office.<br />\nThe incumbent Vice -President for Business<br />\nManagement, Robert C. Bowie, will become<br />\nVice-President for Finance and Management Systems.<br />\nThis post is designed for a staff role, monitoring fiscal and<br />\nmanagement policies within the University. Bowie will<br />\nalso be the principal budget adviser to President Muller.<br />\nAdministrative functions of the old V.P. for Business<br />\nManagement will be transferred to the V.P. for<br />\nAdministrative Services.<br />\nRoss Jones will shift from Vice-President for University<br />\nAffairs to Vice-President for Institutional Affairs, There<br />\n<br />\nhe will be-,11-ie .senior development and public relations<br />\nofficer of Hopkins institutions. Also, Dr. Richard S. Ross<br />\nwill change his title to Vice-President for Medicine, where<br />\nhe will share in the supervision of the clinical patient-care<br />\nactivities of the Hopkins institutions. He will continue to<br />\nserve as Dean of the Medical Scnool.<br />\nThe fifth vice-presidency will remain unchanged.<br />\nExecutive Vice-President and Director of the Johns.<br />\nHopkins Hospital Dr. Robert M. Heyssel will continue to<br />\ndirect operations of the Hospital.<br />\nThe primary purpose of the reorganization, according<br />\nto President Muller, is to integrate and reaffirm the joint<br />\nPresidency of the University and the Hospital. \"The joint<br />\npresidency of the two institutions has been in effect for<br />\nnearly five years,\" he commented, \"and can be more<br />\neffectively institutionalized.\"<br />\n\"Until now, we have had separate organs for the<br />\nUniversity and for the Hospital,\" he continued.\"When we<br />\nfirst had a joint President, we really didn't know how it<br />\nwould work. I myself, the Boards of Trustees, and my<br />\n\"The job was a mix of academic and non-academic<br />\ncolleagues reached the conclusion around the end of 1975 services,\" posed President Muller as another reason for the<br />\nthat the, joint Presidency should be continued and that termination of the job. \"We're somewhat discontinuing<br />\nwe ought to consider it permanent.

In keeping with the theme,<br />\nfestivities will include a masked ball, jazz music, and a<br />\nkiewe.<br />\nFair chairman Mike Posever explained that Mardi Gras<br />\nwas chosen as the theme \"because it's colorful and there's<br />\na lot of possibility in the lines of entertainment and food<br />\nthat's never been done before.<br />\n\"We're expecting up to 100,000 people. Last year we<br />\nhad 60-80,000. Booth exhibits are another of the fair's staple<br />\nattractions. Posever said, \"This year we've made a specific<br />\neffort to upgrade the arts and crafts exhibits.<br />\nThis year we'vereally tried to improve the quality.\"<br />\nIn order to qualify for a booth, a craftsman must send<br />\nsamples or pictures of his or her work for screening.<br />\nAccording to Posever, \"We goson a rolling admissions<br />\nbasis.

This annual meeting, far from being a moribund<br />\naffair, has in previous years beer: marked by a high degree<br />\nof picayune quarrelling and violence.<br />\nHowever, because the SAC budget is balanced and each<br />\nparticipating organization has already agieed to the amount<br />\nof currency it is to recieve, today's meeting will probably<br />\nproceed with an absence of fisticuffs.<br />\nThe 1977-78 operating budget is $108,000, which<br />\nfeatures an increase of $8,000 from this year. According<br />\nto Ron Bialek, outgoing head of the SAC,the increase has<br />\nboth good and bad consequences: \"The SAC was<br />\nextremely lucky to get an lye 000 increase for next year,<br />\nbut that' means that Ja<br />\nand Chris Columbo won't<br />\nhave big contingency funds to help bail out those clubs<br />\nthat get into financial difficulty.\"<br />\nOut of the $108,000, the largest outlay is for the<br />\nNews-Letter, which receives $7,200. \"In order to print<br />\nthe News-Letter twice a week,\" Bialek said, \"they need<br />\nthe cash. It's pretty legitimate.\"<br />\nYet, he continued, \"Considering the complaints I've<br />\ngotten from students about the 'content of the Friday<br />\nNews-Letter, it's hard to justify that $7,200. They feel<br />\nthat for features they could go out and buy a quality<br />\nmagazine like Time or Newsweek. I'd like to be able to<br />\npick up ' a N-L that had a combination of news and<br />\nfeatures.\"<br />\nClose behind the N-L in operating costs is Milli,<br />\nwhich is budgeted for approximately $6,300. With the<br />\ninstallation of an FM transmitter, WJHU will be able to<br />\nexpand and provide another source of campus<br />\ninformation besides the N-L.

Of course, a few political bywords come<br />\nto mind immediately; undoubtedly, we all would recall<br />\nsuch phrases as 'containing the arms race', 'support for<br />\nIi uman rights', and 'cooperation', but even these<br />\ncormerstones of action have not been emoloyed at times<br />\nwhen outside pressure beeame overpowering and when<br />\nthe real decisionswere to be made.<br />\n<br />\nWhizzes balance<br />\nHopkins bucks<br />\n<br />\ncontrary interests and ideas as well as the<br />\nnevessary might to overcome or at least severely hamper<br />\nthe President's goal plans.<br />\nOn the matter of human rights, there are also<br />\ndifferences between the policies that the President has<br />\nendorsed and those that are ultimately enacted. Among<br />\nthe human riflits principles outlined in the Helsinki<br />\nAgreement was one calling for increased travel<br />\nopportunities and exchanges of East and West business,<br />\nscientific, and cultural groups. But the recent US decision<br />\nt bar entry to three Soviet trade-union officials/ ho had<br />\nbeen invited to attend a labor conference in the US is at<br />\nvariance with our agreement at Helsinki. In this case, it<br />\nwas not Carter's decision that carried, but the opposition<br />\nof the powerful organization of the AFL-CIO leadership<br />\nand their lobbying efforts which finally swayed the<br />\ndecision.<br />\nOf equal importance as the need for consensus among<br />\nthe groups that influence and decide US foreign policy,is<br />\nthe necessity of a clear I foreign policy, is the necessity of<br />\na clear position on US involvement in disputes in other<br />\nparts of they' orld. Of prime interest at this time are the<br />\ncountries of Africa and especially Zaire, which is<br />\ncurrently being invaded by Soviet-supplied guerillas from<br />\nAngola. Mr. Carter, this time faced with a situation that<br />\ninvolved little opposition from domestic groups, decided<br />\nnot to sene military aid even though it was evident that<br />\nthe Soviet Union had militarily supplied the insurgents.<br />\nInstead, the US agreed to send 'nonlethal' material,<br />\nnecessitating the involvement and arms pledges of the<br />\nFrench, the Belgian, and several other governments.

President Carter has<br />\nstated that the US eill support any nation dedicated to<br />\n'democratic principles' but if he does not begin soon by<br />\nsupporting nations that need our military aid to remain<br />\ndemocratic, there may be none that survive.<br />\nThe foreign policy of a country with a number of<br />\npowerful interest groups like the United States cannot<br />\nconceivably be formulated by one man. Undoubtedly,<br />\nthis dilemma presents problems of enacting a consistent<br />\nforeign policy line. But in the interest of our allies,-and<br />\nthose nations that. have come to depend on the United<br />\nStates as a balancing force against the Soviet Union in<br />\nworld affairs, it is our responsibility to involve ourselves.<br />\n<br />\nFor example, the United States is committed to the<br />\nreduction and control of proliferation of nuclear<br />\nweapons, but even as Washington reporters scribbled the<br />\nrestrainingw ords Carter spoke,construction continued at<br />\na quick pace on the new US Military base on Diego Garcia<br />\nin the Indian Ocean.

Obviously, our cooperation<br />\nis unresponsive on this matter and our commitment to<br />\n'the race' is progressing in leaps and bounds.<br />\nYet it appears that President Carter is not totally to<br />\nblame for \u2022 discrepancies in US foreign policy.<br />\nUndoubtedly, Mr. Carter's rhetoric on stemming the arms<br />\nrace or reducing it draws everything from concerned<br />\nfrowns to concealed chuckles from Pentagon officials and<br />\narms dealers;, both major foreign policy formulators in<br />\ntheir own rights.

Though more of a letter than an actual<br />\ndeclaration (as part of an effort to strike all undue<br />\nformality from student government), I hope this<br />\nstatement, will,serve to reaffirm my views and, amidst the<br />\nclass primaries, perhaps define the guidelines by which the<br />\nincoming Council might operate.<br />\nThe most general, all-encompassing duties of the<br />\nStudent Council are to represent and act in the the<br />\ninterests of the Hopkins undergraduates in all matters<br />\ndirectly or indirectly pertaining to them. However, in<br />\norder to to render credence to this proposition certain<br />\nfundamental conditions must be met.<br />\nFirst, it is absolutely necessary that the Council present<br />\nitself as a cohesive front for meeting student needs.<br />\nTherefore, upon assuming office for the coming academic<br />\nyear, the entire Student Council membership must make a<br />\nconscious and concerted attempt to transcend all<br />\nbitterness and personal enmities (often arising from the<br />\nprevious elections) that could possibly hamper Council<br />\nprogress in any given direction. Unless completely devoid<br />\nof in-fighting, the Council will have damned itself from<br />\nthe \u2022 start, leaving the possibilities of accomplishing<br />\nanything of long-term consequence negligible.<br />\nSecond, the Student Council must seek the active<br />\nparticipation of the greatest possible number of<br />\nundergraduates in student<br />\ngovernment. Not only will this promote more widespread<br />\nknowledge and understanding of important issues -- as<br />\nwell as bring new issues to the fore -- but itwill greatly<br />\nfacilitate Council action in areas w here strong student<br />\nreaction can produce an impact. It is also of paramount<br />\nimportance that undergraduates know,who their Council<br />\nrepresentatives are, and utilize them to the fullest as a<br />\nmeans of articulating their concerns. By way of regular<br />\nopen forums (tentatively scheduled for . the second '<br />\n<br />\nTuesday of each month, in the Glass Pavilion) as -a<br />\nbadly-needed supplement to the weekly Council meetings,<br />\nit is hoped that more students will avail themselves of the<br />\nopportunity to make themselves heard.<br />\nThird, the new Council must strive to develop a closer<br />\nrapport ,with the Hopkins faculty. Through revitalized<br />\nstudentliasons to the individual departments, in addition<br />\nto the careful scrutiny of all facets of Hopkins education,<br />\nthe Council and faculty together may take steos toward<br />\nthe overall betterment of undergraduate academics.<br />\nFourth, a more productive wor Icing relationship<br />\nbetween the Council and University administration must<br />\nbe fortered. This does not entail passive submission to<br />\nadministration must be fostered. This does not entail<br />\npassive submission to policies that blatantly conflicbwith<br />\nundergraduate interests, in which case it would be the<br />\nCouncil's duty to spearhead swift :)nd definitive measures<br />\nto counter such an action. Rather, it must be the purpose<br />\nof the Council, through a display of pragmatism and<br />\nsound judgment, to secure a welcomed role in all<br />\npolicy-making that affects the undergraduate.<br />\nOnce the above prerequisites have been fulfilled, the<br />\nCouncil will find itself in a position to implement those<br />\nchanges it deems necessary to improve undergraduate<br />\nexistence at Johns Hopkins -- everything from intersession<br />\ncourse-offerings to the day-to-day social life on campus.<br />\nThe desire, the innovativeness, and the energy are readily<br />\napparent -- only a clear and level-headed approach is<br />\nneeded to see the plans through.

Robert Arellano will<br />\npresent six one-act plays written, directed, produced and<br />\nacted by the students in his play writing workshop. The<br />\nprogram mingles comedy and satire with realistic drama.<br />\nStudent demand led to the birth of the play writing<br />\ncourses in 1971. Arellano, an instructor in the Chemistry<br />\nDepartment, taught \"Problem Drama\" to a handful of<br />\neager undergraduates. The \"problems\" they wrote about<br />\nwere generally restricted to those at Homewood:<br />\nautomatic vending machines in Levering Hall and the<br />\ninefficient University president who just wouldn't quit.<br />\nInterestingly enough, just before five plays were<br />\nperformed, all dealing with President Lincoln Gordon's<br />\ninadequacies, he resigned his position at Johns Hopkins.<br />\nAfter the end of the Vietnamese War, protest plays were<br />\nreplaced by real-life drama.<br />\nThe young playwrights did not always enjoy the<br />\nbenefits of Levering Hall's Little Theatre. They first<br />\nperformed plays in Maryland Hall, the Garrett Room,the<br />\nJ and H Rooms, and even in Shaffer 3. Many times stage<br />\nhands w ould arrange props and lights while a nervous<br />\nprofessor was trying to wrap up his lecture. Finally, Dean<br />\n<br />\nOwen procured funds to buy floodlights and lumber for a<br />\nstage, and playwriting moved to its present'location. The<br />\nLittle Theatre seats seventy comfortably, but Arellano<br />\nclaims the record for cramming people ,in is one hundred<br />\nand two,counting those seated on the. window sills.<br />\nRobert Arellano left his native Cuba in 1959 and<br />\nreceived his B.A. and M .A. at the Massachusetts Institute<br />\nof Technology. He came to Johns Hopkins in 1961 as a<br />\nchemistry instructor; and enrolled in Writing Seminars<br />\ncourses during his spare time. He received his M.A. from<br />\nthat department the following year. .<br />\nArellano's classes, including a quickie intersession<br />\ncourse, have performed over two hundred and fifty plays<br />\nsince 1971.

He is also preparing for a summer musical.<br />\nSays Arellano about drama and chemistry, \"It's a very<br />\ngood combination because you don't get bored.\" Indeed,<br />\nhe is not the only one, as his course is ranked among the<br />\ntop by students, and at show-time the Little Theatre is<br />\nalmost always filled to capacity.<br />\n<br />\nYoung Dudes respond toYoung Dems<br />\n<br />\nfr<br />\n<br />\nThe recent article concerning attempts to force the<br />\nunionization of Southern textile plants was submitted by<br />\nthe Yotnig Democrats.

Any increase in wages gained by the union<br />\nwill lead to higher prices, a higher cost of living, and<br />\nfurther wage demands. Neither should it be forgotten that<br />\nunion membership ' costs both the worker and his<br />\nemployer money; money that might otherwise go to<br />\nwagess and capital investment. And what service does the<br />\nunion provide, that workers could not provide for<br />\nthemselves without paying the union hierarchy?<br />\nIf, as is alleged, laws have been violated, redress is<br />\navailable. It were not as if employees needed to submit to<br />\nunionization in order to have their legal rights protected.<br />\nThere is, however, an issue at stake that reaches well<br />\nbeyond the Stevens plants, sweaty or not, beyond the<br />\nSouth, beyond even the media hirelings. Those who<br />\nsupport the forced unionization of'Stevens workers claim<br />\nfor themselves the words \"freedom\" and \"justice.\"<br />\nRegardless of the price paid out of the pockets of<br />\nAmerican workers, these concepts cannot be bought.<br />\nThey cannot be annexed to a cause that has, at its basis, a<br />\nsystem of political and economic coercion.<br />\nA union election is not what it seems. In the absence of<br />\nRight-to-Work Laws, derided by unionists, a bare majority<br />\nof workers in a single plant may force their fellow<br />\nemployees to submit their own paychecks to union<br />\nsiphoning, under pain of disemployment. There is no<br />\nfreedom; there is compulsory deprivation of property.<br />\nThose unwilling workers who, valuing their livelihoods<br />\nover their indpendence, acquiesce to this dues-slavery lose<br />\ntheir political freedom as well. The supposed power of the<br />\nMeaneys and Woodcocks of the textile industry may in<br />\nthe future be built on the backs of unwilling union<br />\nmembers. Their political support is subsumed wliAn the<br />\n<br />\nlabor bosses flaunt membership figures before officials.<br />\nThere is no freedom; there is restraint of freedom of<br />\n'assocation. The same rationale that prompted the textile plants to<br />\n<br />\nbe relocated in the Sotith could, as easily, close them.

This was particularly unfortunate as top RBI man<br />\nDave Lewing followed with a double (the lone JHU<br />\nextra-base hit of the game) - a hit that certainly/ would<br />\nhave scored Emala.<br />\nA strikingly similar Jay sixth saw Frank Parreira open<br />\nwith a single followed by a clutch two-strike single by<br />\nBobby McCoy after the bunt sign was taken off.

He pitched the full ten innings,<br />\nfacing 36 batters,while giving up only one walk, yielding<br />\nonly one hit in the last five innings and picking up his<br />\nsecond victory/without a loss.<br />\nThe loyal and good sized crowd was ready in the<br />\nsecond game for thel Jays to go out and demolish the<br />\nBears early, but once again the cardiac kids yielded a<br />\nbunch of runs in the first frame.<br />\nWith little support behind him in the field and/with<br />\nseemingly no anger in hi s pitches, Jay starter and smoke<br />\nthrower Charlie Lachenbruch was wild and gave way to<br />\niron man reliver Mike Santo in the first inning.<br />\nThe Jay scoring began in the second and capitalized<br />\nagain on Ursinus throws which had little written on them<br />\nbut good distance and ,not the pockets of their<br />\nteammates' gloves.<br />\nIn the third, Emala wound up on third after a passed<br />\nball on ball four.

They weren't<br />\ndisappointed.<br />\nThe Big Red of Cornell staged an inspired second half<br />\ncomeback to nip the Blue Jays 12-11, thus preserving<br />\nCornell's top ranking and extending the Big Red's two<br />\nyear winning streak to 20 consecutive victories.<br />\nFor Hopkins, the loss was a bitter one to accept. The<br />\nJays led throughout most of the game and had even held a<br />\n7-1 advantage late in the first half. Howeifer, JHU could<br />\nnot stop the Cornell onslaught and now finds itself in the<br />\nnumber 3 position in the Coaches Poll, trailing both<br />\nCornell and Maryland.<br />\nDespite the Big Red second half rally, the game Nvas<br />\nlost by Hopkins during the first thirty minutes of play.<br />\nFor although JHU held a 7- 91ead at intermission , the<br />\nBlue Jays had -missed numerous scoring opportunities in<br />\nthe first two periods- chances which, if converted into<br />\ngoals, would probably have negated the Cornell third<br />\nperiod comeback.<br />\nWhile the offense sputtered through much of the first<br />\nhalf, the Hopkins defense performed brilliantly. Led by a<br />\nsupreme effort from goalie Kevin Mahon, the JHU<br />\nbackline totally stymied the home team offense, enabling<br />\nthe large halftime lead to be amassed.<br />\nHopkins midfielder Dave Huntley started the Jays off<br />\non the proper foot in the opening quarter.

They<br />\nquickly tied the game and, after Wayne Davis put JHU up<br />\n10-9, took control of the contest.

Cornell began to solve the<br />\nriddle of the Blue Jay defense that had stumped them so<br />\nthoroughly in the first half, while the Hopkins offense<br />\ngrinded to a halt.<br />\nThe teams traded goals to open the period, but the Big<br />\nRed then began to assert itself. Cornell tallied a pair of<br />\nunanswered scores to bring the count to 8-5 midway<br />\nthrough the period.<br />\nDuring the next series of plays, Jay middie Bob<br />\nDeSimone picked up an errant ball in his defensive zone<br />\nand began a fast break. A perfect pass to O'Neill deep in<br />\nthe Cornell zone set Mike up one-on-one with the goalie.<br />\nHowever, the shot hit the top pipe and the deep rebound<br />\nwas taken by a Big Red midfielder, who started a break in<br />\nthe opposite direction - an opportunity that culminated in<br />\na Cornell goal.<br />\nFollowing the game, JHU head Coach Henry Ciccarone<br />\npointed to that series of plays as a turning point in the<br />\ngame.<br />\n\"If Mike scores, we're up 9-5 and have some of the<br />\nmomentum,\" the Coach explained. \"Instead, it's now 8-6<br />\nand they (Cornell) still have the momentum.\"<br />\nThe Big Red continued their charge and added another<br />\n<br />\nNetmen smash their way to Success<br />\nBy ANDREW COHEN<br />\nThe Blue Jays Men's Tennis Team continued their<br />\nsmashing success by demolishing the University of<br />\nMaryland in Baltimore last Friday afternoon by the score<br />\nof 8-1 at the downtown campus.<br />\nThe Jay victory, coupled with their 9-0 drubbing of<br />\nWidener College at home earlier in the week, lifted their<br />\nseason record to .500 at 4-4. Both games were highlighted<br />\nwith ,strong performances from the singles and doubles<br />\ncorps.<br />\nAgainst Widener every one of the nine matches, bar<br />\none, went to the Blue Jays in straight sets. AT first<br />\nsingles, Ken Vogelstein took his Widener opponent<br />\nhandily 6-3 and 6-1. In the second slot, Kevin Little<br />\ncrushed his adversary 6-0, 6-2 while Mike Mont, third<br />\nsingles player, whipped the Widener third man, 6-2, 6-0.<br />\nSenior Captain Chuck McCulloch handed Widener its<br />\nmost embarassing defeat of the day when he annihilated<br />\nhis opponent 6-0, 6-0. Jeremy Levin and Ken Feinberg,<br />\nfifth and sixth singles players respectively, switched roles<br />\nfor this game, with Feinberg taking his match 6-3, 6-4 and<br />\nLevin going to three games before coming up the winner<br />\nat 64,2-6, and 6-3.<br />\nIn the doubles column the only real contest saw the<br />\nfirst team of Little and Mont edge out their opponents in<br />\nstraight sets 7-5, 6-4. Vogelstein and McCulloch easily<br />\ntook the second position by winning 6-1 and 6-0.<br />\nSophomore Mike Grohol replaced Levin in the third<br />\ndoubles spot and along with Feinberg defeated Widener<br />\n6-3, 6-4.<br />\nThe UMBC match was quite as impresive as the earlier<br />\ncontest. On this occasion, though, Mont was unable to<br />\nPlay so Grohol was called upon to fill the sixth singles<br />\nvacancy and everyone from McCulloch down moved up a<br />\nstep on the ladder. Vogelstein and Little were easy<br />\nIvrinners in their regular spots with scores of 6-3, 6-2, and<br />\n6-1, 6-3, respectively. McCulloch, Levin and Feinberg, all<br />\nin their new positions, also chalked up victories by<br />\n<br />\nrespective scores of 6-1,.7-5; 6-1, 6-1; and 6-3, 6-4. The<br />\nonly loss the Jays suffered in the contests came when<br />\nGrohol dropped his match in straight sets 6-4,64.<br />\nAgain, the Jay tennis bums swept the doubles portion<br />\nof the game. This time, though, Coach Bob Hughes<br />\nshuffled up his team play lineup. This strategic move<br />\nproved effective as Vogelstein and McCulloch, elevated to<br />\nthe first slot, Little and Levin, and Feinberg and Grohol<br />\ntook their matches 6-1, 2-6, 6-4; 6-1, 64; and 64, 6-0,<br />\nrespectively.<br />\nThese two huge victories seemed to amply make up for<br />\nthe two disappointing losses the Blue Jays were handed<br />\ntwo weeks ago. On April 8, the team traveled to<br />\nWashington, D.C. to face Catholic University.<br />\nUnfortunately, the Jays had to forfeit the second doubles<br />\nmatch and the third doubles contest fell by the wayside<br />\n<br />\ndue. t dar ness. McCulloch and Feinberg in singles, and<br />\nthe doubles tandem of Little and Mont were the, only<br />\nvictorious netmen.

Furthermore, the professor, who is<br />\n51, has recently started his second term on the 13altimor<br />\nCity Board of Education.<br />\nBorn ,and raised in Oberlin, Ohio, Dr. Scott went to<br />\nOberlin College and received his Ph.D. at Hopkins: \"Like<br />\nmost blacks, I viewed education as a means to an end, the<br />\nend being getting a job -- so I figured if I could major in<br />\nthe most difficult course in the curriculum I could get a<br />\njob. The most difficult course was physics, so I majored in<br />\nphysics in college and got a Master's degree in it, and for<br />\nme the most difficult part of physics was fluid dynamics,<br />\nso I got a Ph. D. in that.\"<br />\nBefore arriving at Johns Hopkins, Professor Scott<br />\ntaught at several state colleges and, as a result, his opinion<br />\nof the students here is high: \"I've spent a lot of time<br />\nteaching in state institutions, schools where if you<br />\ngraduated from high school you could get admitted. I've<br />\nhad students in the college classes who couldn't read or<br />\nwrite; so I am tremendously impressed with the Hopkins'<br />\nstudents, maybe too impressed, because of my having<br />\ntaught so much in the other schools. The students here<br />\nare outstanding.\"<br />\nMany of the non science-oriented students here are<br />\nfamiliar with Dr. Scott through his teaching of the<br />\nintroductory ..course, Astronomy and the Solar System.<br />\n(Commonly called Astrogut.) According to the Professor,<br />\nhis interest in astronomy was not accidental, but instead<br />\nresulted from his previous work in fluid dynamics: \"The<br />\ncore of the earth and some of the other planets is fluid,<br />\nand it is those fluid dynamical processes that give rise, so<br />\nthe theory says, to the magnetic fields of the earth and<br />\nthe planets. So I had a chance to apply my knowledge of<br />\nfluid dynamics to an astronomical problem, and thus I<br />\nbecame interested in astronomy.\"<br /><br />\nHowever, because Dr. Scott employs a flamboyant<br />\nlecture style and is prone to the unearthing of<br />\nlittle-known iaformation, wary students often question<br />\nthe factual basis of the lectures. To these complaints the<br />\nProfessor replies: \"I have read, I think, every astronomy<br />\ntext in existence, and with that kind of background it is<br />\nwry easy to prepare the kind of lectures that I do.\"<br /><br />\nProfessor Scott finds satisfaction in helping to formulate<br />\nthe policies of the Baltimoe City School Board, a body to<br />\nwhich he was recently renominated. by Mayor Schaefer.<br />\nThe Board, however, far from ensuring that the public<br />\nschools are as good as they can be, has had difficulties<br />\nmaintaining high standards of excellence in education in<br /><br />\nrecent years.<br />\n\"No, the schools are not as good as they should be, but<br />\nthis Board is going to make them better,\" declared Dr.<br />\nScott. \"I think that I helped change the Board's thinking<br />\n.-- that we should return to the basics in education. Let's<br />\nemphasize the fact that the youngsters must learn to read<br />\nand write -- that wasn't the emphasis four or five years<br />\nago.\"<br />\nDr. Scott's concern for education is by no means<br />\nlimited to the Board, for he has been active in attempts to<br />\nexpand and diversify the educational opportunities at<br />\nHopkins. Despite these efforts, he still feels that many of<br />\nthe students do not ta c advantage of the widening<br />\ncurriculum.<br />\n\"I am somewhat concerned with the tendency of the<br />\nstudents to specialize, hut that may be necessary. I do<br />\nthink the students could be a little more well-rounded<br />\nthan they are, but that's going to require more time, and<br />\nthe time is not available.<br />\n\"I did agree sonic years ago with the student<br />\ncontention that the undergraduate program As not-as<br />\nbroad as it should have been, but there's been a lot of<br />\nimprovement in that area and maybe we can see some<br />\nmore. That is, there weren't enough courses being offered,<br />\non the undergraduate level. There are more now, but I am<br />\nnot-quite sure if there are enough.\"<br />\nOf course, Professor Scott realizes that mere expansion<br />\nof the undergraduate curriculum will not guarantee<br />\nwell-rounded students, and that .the ultimate aim of the<br />\nbulk of the students to reach graduate schools limits the<br />\nvariety of courses one can take. \"I think the solution is<br />\ngoing to lie with the medical schools and the graduate<br />\nschools, and as long as spaces are limited, you're going to<br />\nhave to have this kind of competition.\"<br />\nAlthough these conditions may be harmful in some<br />\nrespects, Professor Scott feels that, overall, receiving one's<br />\neducation at Hopkins is a worthwhile experience. \"I think<br />\nwe are producing well-educated graduates. I believe the<br />\ngraduate here knows something when he le;ivcs. The goal<br />\nof Hopkins is what it has always been, and that is to make<br />\na contribution to society -- Hopkins has done that and iF<br />\ncontinuing to do that.\"<br /><br />\nINSIDE THIS ISSUE<br />\nAdministrators do theVarsity Rag p.3<br />\nChesanow's Declaration of Principles p.6<br /><br />\npage 2/news-letter/april 19, 1977<br />\nThe Clydesdale horses will appear at the Johns Hopkins<br />\nHospital May 13 and volunteers are needed to solicit the crowds<br />\nfor donations.

The Provost (Dr. Richard<br />\nLongaker) will assume the acade,mic functions previously<br />\nperformed by these two vice-presidencies, including<br />\nsupervision of the MSE Library and the Dean of Students<br />\nOffice. On the organizational chart, the Deans at<br />\nHomewood, SAIS, and East Baltimore will be directly<br />\nresponsible to the Provost rather than these two<br />\nvice-presidencies as they were in the past.<br />\nAdministrative duties performed by these two positions<br />\nwill be transferred to the newly created vice-president for<br />\nAdministrative Services. No candidate has yet been<br />\nselected to fill this office.<br />\nThe incumbent Vice -President for Business<br />\nManagement, Robert C. Bowie, will become<br />\nVice-President for Finance and Management Systems.<br />\nThis post is designed for a staff role, monitoring fiscal and<br />\nmanagement policies within the University.

Also, Dr. Richard S. Ross<br />\nwill change his title to Vice-President for Medicine, where<br />\nhe will share in the supervision of the clinical patient-care<br />\nactivities of the Hopkins institutions. He will continue to<br />\nserve as Dean of the Medical Scnool.<br />\nThe fifth vice-presidency will remain unchanged.<br />\nExecutive Vice-President and Director of the Johns.<br />\nHopkins Hospital Dr. Robert M. Heyssel will continue to<br />\ndirect operations of the Hospital.<br />\nThe primary purpose of the reorganization, according<br />\nto President Muller, is to integrate and reaffirm the joint<br />\nPresidency of the University and the Hospital. \"The joint<br />\npresidency of the two institutions has been in effect for<br />\nnearly five years,\" he commented, \"and can be more<br />\neffectively institutionalized.\"<br />\n\"Until now, we have had separate organs for the<br />\nUniversity and for the Hospital,\" he continued.\"When we<br />\nfirst had a joint President, we really didn't know how it<br />\nwould work.

Last year we<br />\nhad 60-80,000. Booth exhibits are another of the fair's staple<br />\nattractions. Posever said, \"This year we've made a specific<br />\neffort to upgrade the arts and crafts exhibits.<br />\nThis year we'vereally tried to improve the quality.\"<br />\nIn order to qualify for a booth, a craftsman must send<br />\nsamples or pictures of his or her work for screening.<br />\nAccording to Posever, \"We goson a rolling admissions<br />\nbasis.

According<br />\nto Ron Bialek, outgoing head of the SAC,the increase has<br />\nboth good and bad consequences: \"The SAC was<br />\nextremely lucky to get an lye 000 increase for next year,<br />\nbut that' means that Ja<br />\nand Chris Columbo won't<br />\nhave big contingency funds to help bail out those clubs<br />\nthat get into financial difficulty.\"<br />\nOut of the $108,000, the largest outlay is for the<br />\nNews-Letter, which receives $7,200. \"In order to print<br />\nthe News-Letter twice a week,\" Bialek said, \"they need<br />\nthe cash. It's pretty legitimate.\"<br />\nYet, he continued, \"Considering the complaints I've<br />\ngotten from students about the 'content of the Friday<br />\nNews-Letter, it's hard to justify that $7,200. They feel<br />\nthat for features they could go out and buy a quality<br />\nmagazine like Time or Newsweek. I'd like to be able to<br />\npick up ' a N-L that had a combination of news and<br />\nfeatures.\"<br />\nClose behind the N-L in operating costs is Milli,<br />\nwhich is budgeted for approximately $6,300. With the<br />\ninstallation of an FM transmitter, WJHU will be able to<br />\nexpand and provide another source of campus<br />\ninformation besides the N-L. Says Bialek, \"I've had no<br />\ncomplaints concerning the expansion of WJHU. Everyone<br />\nthat I've talked to thinks it's a great idea.\"<br />\nOne of the few organizations that will take a cut in<br />\nbudget is Ellipsis (formerly Collection of Words), whose<br />\nallocations will decrease from $1350 to $900.<br />\n\"Last year they screamed that they needed $1350 for<br />\nproduction, prize money, etc., so we gave it to them,\"<br />\nsaid Bialek. \"But they've already spent a good portion of<br />\nthat one one full-page and four quarter-page ads in the<br />\nNews-Letter. They've spent more on adskhan on prizes.<br />\nIn the SAC we have to justify this iid of spending to the<br />\nadministration and the faculty.

Of course, a few political bywords come<br />\nto mind immediately; undoubtedly, we all would recall<br />\nsuch phrases as 'containing the arms race', 'support for<br />\nIi uman rights', and 'cooperation', but even these<br />\ncormerstones of action have not been emoloyed at times<br />\nwhen outside pressure beeame overpowering and when<br />\nthe real decisionswere to be made.<br /><br />\nWhizzes balance<br />\nHopkins bucks<br /><br />\ncontrary interests and ideas as well as the<br />\nnevessary might to overcome or at least severely hamper<br />\nthe President's goal plans.<br />\nOn the matter of human rights, there are also<br />\ndifferences between the policies that the President has<br />\nendorsed and those that are ultimately enacted. Among<br />\nthe human riflits principles outlined in the Helsinki<br />\nAgreement was one calling for increased travel<br />\nopportunities and exchanges of East and West business,<br />\nscientific, and cultural groups. But the recent US decision<br />\nt bar entry to three Soviet trade-union officials/ ho had<br />\nbeen invited to attend a labor conference in the US is at<br />\nvariance with our agreement at Helsinki. In this case, it<br />\nwas not Carter's decision that carried, but the opposition<br />\nof the powerful organization of the AFL-CIO leadership<br />\nand their lobbying efforts which finally swayed the<br />\ndecision.<br />\nOf equal importance as the need for consensus among<br />\nthe groups that influence and decide US foreign policy,is<br />\nthe necessity of a clear I foreign policy, is the necessity of<br />\na clear position on US involvement in disputes in other<br />\nparts of they' orld. Of prime interest at this time are the<br />\ncountries of Africa and especially Zaire, which is<br />\ncurrently being invaded by Soviet-supplied guerillas from<br />\nAngola. Mr. Carter, this time faced with a situation that<br />\ninvolved little opposition from domestic groups, decided<br />\nnot to sene military aid even though it was evident that<br />\nthe Soviet Union had militarily supplied the insurgents.<br />\nInstead, the US agreed to send 'nonlethal' material,<br />\nnecessitating the involvement and arms pledges of the<br />\nFrench, the Belgian, and several other governments. The<br />\nSoviets have voiced their intention to make their presence<br />\nfelt in the troubled areas of theSoviets have voiced their<br />\nintention to \"make their presence felt in the troubled<br />\nareas of the world\", seemingly/ ithout constraint and if<br />\nthe United States continues to ignore the requests of<br />\ninvaded nations for arms, Soviet presence 'will .expand<br />\nsimply as a result of our inaction. President Carter has<br />\nstated that the US eill support any nation dedicated to<br />\n'democratic principles' but if he does not begin soon by<br />\nsupporting nations that need our military aid to remain<br />\ndemocratic, there may be none that survive.<br />\nThe foreign policy of a country with a number of<br />\npowerful interest groups like the United States cannot<br />\nconceivably be formulated by one man. Undoubtedly,<br />\nthis dilemma presents problems of enacting a consistent<br />\nforeign policy line. But in the interest of our allies,-and<br />\nthose nations that. have come to depend on the United<br />\nStates as a balancing force against the Soviet Union in<br />\nworld affairs, it is our responsibility to involve ourselves.<br /><br />\nFor example, the United States is committed to the<br />\nreduction and control of proliferation of nuclear<br />\nweapons, but even as Washington reporters scribbled the<br />\nrestrainingw ords Carter spoke,construction continued at<br />\na quick pace on the new US Military base on Diego Garcia<br />\nin the Indian Ocean. Not only does our new base<br />\nrepresent the United States' first permanent foothold in<br />\nthis part of the world, but it is in direct defiance of the<br />\nreiterations of the countries in this part of the world<br />\nwho,x since 1971, have requested that the Indian Ocean<br />\nbe declared a 'zone of peace'. Obviously, our cooperation<br />\nis unresponsive on this matter and our commitment to<br />\n'the race' is progressing in leaps and bounds.<br />\nYet it appears that President Carter is not totally to<br />\nblame for \u2022 discrepancies in US foreign policy.<br />\nUndoubtedly, Mr. Carter's rhetoric on stemming the arms<br />\nrace or reducing it draws everything from concerned<br />\nfrowns to concealed chuckles from Pentagon officials and<br />\narms dealers;, both major foreign policy formulators in<br />\ntheir own rights.

Though more of a letter than an actual<br />\ndeclaration (as part of an effort to strike all undue<br />\nformality from student government), I hope this<br />\nstatement, will,serve to reaffirm my views and, amidst the<br />\nclass primaries, perhaps define the guidelines by which the<br />\nincoming Council might operate.<br />\nThe most general, all-encompassing duties of the<br />\nStudent Council are to represent and act in the the<br />\ninterests of the Hopkins undergraduates in all matters<br />\ndirectly or indirectly pertaining to them. However, in<br />\norder to to render credence to this proposition certain<br />\nfundamental conditions must be met.<br />\nFirst, it is absolutely necessary that the Council present<br />\nitself as a cohesive front for meeting student needs.<br />\nTherefore, upon assuming office for the coming academic<br />\nyear, the entire Student Council membership must make a<br />\nconscious and concerted attempt to transcend all<br />\nbitterness and personal enmities (often arising from the<br />\nprevious elections) that could possibly hamper Council<br />\nprogress in any given direction. Unless completely devoid<br />\nof in-fighting, the Council will have damned itself from<br />\nthe \u2022 start, leaving the possibilities of accomplishing<br />\nanything of long-term consequence negligible.<br />\nSecond, the Student Council must seek the active<br />\nparticipation of the greatest possible number of<br />\nundergraduates in student<br />\ngovernment. Not only will this promote more widespread<br />\nknowledge and understanding of important issues -- as<br />\nwell as bring new issues to the fore -- but itwill greatly<br />\nfacilitate Council action in areas w here strong student<br />\nreaction can produce an impact. It is also of paramount<br />\nimportance that undergraduates know,who their Council<br />\nrepresentatives are, and utilize them to the fullest as a<br />\nmeans of articulating their concerns. By way of regular<br />\nopen forums (tentatively scheduled for . the second '<br /><br />\nTuesday of each month, in the Glass Pavilion) as -a<br />\nbadly-needed supplement to the weekly Council meetings,<br />\nit is hoped that more students will avail themselves of the<br />\nopportunity to make themselves heard.<br />\nThird, the new Council must strive to develop a closer<br />\nrapport ,with the Hopkins faculty. Through revitalized<br />\nstudentliasons to the individual departments, in addition<br />\nto the careful scrutiny of all facets of Hopkins education,<br />\nthe Council and faculty together may take steos toward<br />\nthe overall betterment of undergraduate academics.<br />\nFourth, a more productive wor Icing relationship<br />\nbetween the Council and University administration must<br />\nbe fortered. This does not entail passive submission to<br />\nadministration must be fostered. This does not entail<br />\npassive submission to policies that blatantly conflicbwith<br />\nundergraduate interests, in which case it would be the<br />\nCouncil's duty to spearhead swift :)nd definitive measures<br />\nto counter such an action. Rather, it must be the purpose<br />\nof the Council, through a display of pragmatism and<br />\nsound judgment, to secure a welcomed role in all<br />\npolicy-making that affects the undergraduate.<br />\nOnce the above prerequisites have been fulfilled, the<br />\nCouncil will find itself in a position to implement those<br />\nchanges it deems necessary to improve undergraduate<br />\nexistence at Johns Hopkins -- everything from intersession<br />\ncourse-offerings to the day-to-day social life on campus.<br />\nThe desire, the innovativeness, and the energy are readily<br />\napparent -- only a clear and level-headed approach is<br />\nneeded to see the plans through.

The \"problems\" they wrote about<br />\nwere generally restricted to those at Homewood:<br />\nautomatic vending machines in Levering Hall and the<br />\ninefficient University president who just wouldn't quit.<br />\nInterestingly enough, just before five plays were<br />\nperformed, all dealing with President Lincoln Gordon's<br />\ninadequacies, he resigned his position at Johns Hopkins.<br />\nAfter the end of the Vietnamese War, protest plays were<br />\nreplaced by real-life drama.<br />\nThe young playwrights did not always enjoy the<br />\nbenefits of Levering Hall's Little Theatre. They first<br />\nperformed plays in Maryland Hall, the Garrett Room,the<br />\nJ and H Rooms, and even in Shaffer 3. Many times stage<br />\nhands w ould arrange props and lights while a nervous<br />\nprofessor was trying to wrap up his lecture. Finally, Dean<br /><br />\nOwen procured funds to buy floodlights and lumber for a<br />\nstage, and playwriting moved to its present'location. The<br />\nLittle Theatre seats seventy comfortably, but Arellano<br />\nclaims the record for cramming people ,in is one hundred<br />\nand two,counting those seated on the. window sills.<br />\nRobert Arellano left his native Cuba in 1959 and<br />\nreceived his B.A. and M .A. at the Massachusetts Institute<br />\nof Technology. He came to Johns Hopkins in 1961 as a<br />\nchemistry instructor; and enrolled in Writing Seminars<br />\ncourses during his spare time. He received his M.A. from<br />\nthat department the following year. .<br />\nArellano's classes, including a quickie intersession<br />\ncourse, have performed over two hundred and fifty plays<br />\nsince 1971. Actors are allowed not more than one week<br />\nto learn their lines. Intersession students are permitted a<br />\nmere three days.<br />\nPresently Arellano is busy supervising rehearsals of two<br />\noriginal plays: \"Nicely Goodworth\",<br />\na chemical<br />\ncomedy to be presented during the Spring Fair in Remsen<br />\nHall, and \"Eleven O'clock\", to be presented the following<br />\nweekend. He is also preparing for a summer musical.<br />\nSays Arellano about drama and chemistry, \"It's a very<br />\ngood combination because you don't get bored.\" Indeed,<br />\nhe is not the only one, as his course is ranked among the<br />\ntop by students, and at show-time the Little Theatre is<br />\nalmost always filled to capacity.<br /><br />\nYoung Dudes respond toYoung Dems<br /><br />\nfr<br /><br />\nThe recent article concerning attempts to force the<br />\nunionization of Southern textile plants was submitted by<br />\nthe Yotnig Democrats. Yet, in a larger sense, the<br />\ncharacterizations of the evil magnate and the blameless<br />\nlabor organizer are the creation of well-salaried curators<br />\nof public opinion. Fifteen million dollars of workers'<br />\nsalaries buys many stereotypes.<br />\nThe migration of the American textile industry to the<br />\nSouth is not solely the result of an attempt to avoid the<br />\npower of Union bosses. Management knows well that the<br />\nhirelings of Big Labor will travel, for a price. Non-union,<br />\nas well as organized, plants moved from the Northeast.<br />\nOther aspects of overhead costs-- power, taxes, and rent -influenced the decision.<br />\nThe allegedly low wage scale of Stevens employees is<br />\noffered as evidence of management wrongdoing. To note.<br />\nonly that the STevens worker receives somewhat less than<br />\nthe averageAmerican factory worker does not take into<br />\naccount differences in skill, cost of living, and job market<br />\nconditions. Any increase in wages gained by the union<br />\nwill lead to higher prices, a higher cost of living, and<br />\nfurther wage demands. Neither should it be forgotten that<br />\nunion membership ' costs both the worker and his<br />\nemployer money; money that might otherwise go to<br />\nwagess and capital investment. And what service does the<br />\nunion provide, that workers could not provide for<br />\nthemselves without paying the union hierarchy?<br />\nIf, as is alleged, laws have been violated, redress is<br />\navailable. It were not as if employees needed to submit to<br />\nunionization in order to have their legal rights protected.<br />\nThere is, however, an issue at stake that reaches well<br />\nbeyond the Stevens plants, sweaty or not, beyond the<br />\nSouth, beyond even the media hirelings. Those who<br />\nsupport the forced unionization of'Stevens workers claim<br />\nfor themselves the words \"freedom\" and \"justice.\"<br />\nRegardless of the price paid out of the pockets of<br />\nAmerican workers, these concepts cannot be bought.<br />\nThey cannot be annexed to a cause that has, at its basis, a<br />\nsystem of political and economic coercion.<br />\nA union election is not what it seems. In the absence of<br />\nRight-to-Work Laws, derided by unionists, a bare majority<br />\nof workers in a single plant may force their fellow<br />\nemployees to submit their own paychecks to union<br />\nsiphoning, under pain of disemployment. There is no<br />\nfreedom; there is compulsory deprivation of property.<br />\nThose unwilling workers who, valuing their livelihoods<br />\nover their indpendence, acquiesce to this dues-slavery lose<br />\ntheir political freedom as well. The supposed power of the<br />\nMeaneys and Woodcocks of the textile industry may in<br />\nthe future be built on the backs of unwilling union<br />\nmembers. Their political support is subsumed wliAn the<br /><br />\nlabor bosses flaunt membership figures before officials.<br />\nThere is no freedom; there is restraint of freedom of<br />\n'assocation. The same rationale that prompted the textile plants to<br /><br />\nbe relocated in the Sotith could, as easily, close them. The<br />\nsame groups -- the same party -- that support the Stevens<br />\nventure oppose protectionism. The' two positions are<br />\ncontradictory.<br />\nsubmitted by the Young Republicans<br /><br />\nNear a Dike in the Dakotas<br />\nHer regime detracted from our union<br />\nAlthough severe press laws had been repealed<br />\nShe hid in shadows, mute but able.<br /><br />\nShe said her press conferences call for<br />\nMy indulgence and participation<br />\nYet she always answered \"I can't comment.\"<br /><br />\nWhen the tongue and its telegraph<br />\nBecome inundated in decision<br />\nWiresv ithe on,- catery ground:<br /><br />\n\u2022<br /><br />\nMust I manage emergency repairs<br />\nLike a National Guardsman crashing<br />\nSome flooded dike in the Dakotas?<br />\nThe waters reel over your wrinkling skin;<br />\nI canoe through rapids near your struggle<br />\nProffering final measures of strength.<br />\nBut you're not willing to swim or stretch<br />\nYou wallow, convulsions sweep you away<br />\nLike a tumbling old stove<br />\nMichel Krug<br /><br />\npage 8/news-letter/april, 19; 19.77<br />\nlimusimminommiemiumw mow<br /><br />\nFrom April 1 through June 14, you can fly roundtrip from<br />\nNew York to Luxembourg for only $4.10.<br />\nThat's $89 less than the youth fare you'd pay on any<br />\nother scheduled airline.(From Chicago you pay $458 and<br />\nsave $103.)

They weren't<br />\ndisappointed.<br />\nThe Big Red of Cornell staged an inspired second half<br />\ncomeback to nip the Blue Jays 12-11, thus preserving<br />\nCornell's top ranking and extending the Big Red's two<br />\nyear winning streak to 20 consecutive victories.<br />\nFor Hopkins, the loss was a bitter one to accept. The<br />\nJays led throughout most of the game and had even held a<br />\n7-1 advantage late in the first half. Howeifer, JHU could<br />\nnot stop the Cornell onslaught and now finds itself in the<br />\nnumber 3 position in the Coaches Poll, trailing both<br />\nCornell and Maryland.<br />\nDespite the Big Red second half rally, the game Nvas<br />\nlost by Hopkins during the first thirty minutes of play.<br />\nFor although JHU held a 7- 91ead at intermission , the<br />\nBlue Jays had -missed numerous scoring opportunities in<br />\nthe first two periods- chances which, if converted into<br />\ngoals, would probably have negated the Cornell third<br />\nperiod comeback.<br />\nWhile the offense sputtered through much of the first<br />\nhalf, the Hopkins defense performed brilliantly. Led by a<br />\nsupreme effort from goalie Kevin Mahon, the JHU<br />\nbackline totally stymied the home team offense, enabling<br />\nthe large halftime lead to be amassed.<br />\nHopkins midfielder Dave Huntley started the Jays off<br />\non the proper foot in the opening quarter. The<br />\nsophomore from Canada rifled home the game's first two<br />\ngoals to give the Homewood stickmen a quick 2-0 lead.<br />\nFreshman Frank Cutrone added a score late in the period<br />\nto give JHU a 3-0 advantage after fifteen minutes of play.<br />\nThe style of play continued unchanged throughout<br />\nmost of the second quarter. The dominant factor was the<br />\nJay defense, a unit that. ept the Big REd at bay most of<br />\nthe period.<br />\nHopkins middie Wayne Davis scored to give JHU a 4-0<br />\nlead early in the quarter. Cornell got onto the scoreboard<br />\nseveral minutes later, but JHU's Scott Baugher, Mike<br />\nO'Neill and George Johnson fired home unanswered goals<br />\nto up the lead to 7-1.<br /><br />\npair of goals to gain an 8-L :tie after forty-five minutes of<br />\nplay.<br />\nThe Jays, however, regained their composure for the<br />\nstart of the final period. Midfielder Steve Wey opened the<br />\nscoring in the fourth quarter, giving JHU a 9-8 lead.<br />\nUnfortunately, Cornell was not to be stopped. They<br />\nquickly tied the game and, after Wayne Davis put JHU up<br />\n10-9, took control of the contest. The Big Red whipped<br />\ndiree gOals past the beleaguered Jay defense to establish a<br />\n12-1- lead with less than two minutes'to play.<br />\nThe Jays, however, refused to die and provided an<br />\nexciting climax to the afternoon. Mike O'Neill culminated<br />\na fast break with forty seconds remainingw ith his second<br />\ngoal of the afternoon. JHU's Bob Maimone won the<br />\nensuing face-off (he won 19 of 22-on the afternoon!), but<br />\nthe Jays could not get off a good shot and time ran out.<br />\n\"We're young and we're getting better,\" Ciccarone<br />\ncommented. \"We lost a game and that was extremely<br />\ndisappointing, but I still like our chances to be in<br />\nCharlottesville (site of this year's NCAA championship<br />\ngame).\"<br />\nThe Jays face Brown this Saturday afternoon on<br />\nHomewood field beginning at 2:00. Hopkins will be<br />\nwithout the services of tri-captain Tom Myrick / ho<br />\ninjured his right knee during the third quarter of<br />\nSaturday's game. The extent of the injury is still<br />\nunknown, but the senior from Towson will probably be<br />\nlost to the team for at least three weeks.<br /><br />\n-414,<br />\nThe Big Red cut the margin to 7- Rvith less than half a<br />\nminute remaini::sr!<br />\n- in the half, but the intermission was<br />\nstill a happy time, for the Blue Jay faithful/ hh visions of<br />\na number one ranking dancing in their heads.<br />\nThe situation changed drastically, however, as play got<br />\nunderway in the third quarter. Cornell began to solve the<br />\nriddle of the Blue Jay defense that had stumped them so<br />\nthoroughly in the first half, while the Hopkins offense<br />\ngrinded to a halt.<br />\nThe teams traded goals to open the period, but the Big<br />\nRed then began to assert itself. Cornell tallied a pair of<br />\nunanswered scores to bring the count to 8-5 midway<br />\nthrough the period.<br />\nDuring the next series of plays, Jay middie Bob<br />\nDeSimone picked up an errant ball in his defensive zone<br />\nand began a fast break. A perfect pass to O'Neill deep in<br />\nthe Cornell zone set Mike up one-on-one with the goalie.<br />\nHowever, the shot hit the top pipe and the deep rebound<br />\nwas taken by a Big Red midfielder, who started a break in<br />\nthe opposite direction - an opportunity that culminated in<br />\na Cornell goal.<br />\nFollowing the game, JHU head Coach Henry Ciccarone<br />\npointed to that series of plays as a turning point in the<br />\ngame.<br />\n\"If Mike scores, we're up 9-5 and have some of the<br />\nmomentum,\" the Coach explained. \"Instead, it's now 8-6<br />\nand they (Cornell) still have the momentum.\"<br />\nThe Big Red continued their charge and added another<br /><br />\nNetmen smash their way to Success<br />\nBy ANDREW COHEN<br />\nThe Blue Jays Men's Tennis Team continued their<br />\nsmashing success by demolishing the University of<br />\nMaryland in Baltimore last Friday afternoon by the score<br />\nof 8-1 at the downtown campus.<br />\nThe Jay victory, coupled with their 9-0 drubbing of<br />\nWidener College at home earlier in the week, lifted their<br />\nseason record to .500 at 4-4. Both games were highlighted<br />\nwith ,strong performances from the singles and doubles<br />\ncorps.<br />\nAgainst Widener every one of the nine matches, bar<br />\none, went to the Blue Jays in straight sets. AT first<br />\nsingles, Ken Vogelstein took his Widener opponent<br />\nhandily 6-3 and 6-1. In the second slot, Kevin Little<br />\ncrushed his adversary 6-0, 6-2 while Mike Mont, third<br />\nsingles player, whipped the Widener third man, 6-2, 6-0.<br />\nSenior Captain Chuck McCulloch handed Widener its<br />\nmost embarassing defeat of the day when he annihilated<br />\nhis opponent 6-0, 6-0. Jeremy Levin and Ken Feinberg,<br />\nfifth and sixth singles players respectively, switched roles<br />\nfor this game, with Feinberg taking his match 6-3, 6-4 and<br />\nLevin going to three games before coming up the winner<br />\nat 64,2-6, and 6-3.<br />\nIn the doubles column the only real contest saw the<br />\nfirst team of Little and Mont edge out their opponents in<br />\nstraight sets 7-5, 6-4. Vogelstein and McCulloch easily<br />\ntook the second position by winning 6-1 and 6-0.<br />\nSophomore Mike Grohol replaced Levin in the third<br />\ndoubles spot and along with Feinberg defeated Widener<br />\n6-3, 6-4.<br />\nThe UMBC match was quite as impresive as the earlier<br />\ncontest. On this occasion, though, Mont was unable to<br />\nPlay so Grohol was called upon to fill the sixth singles<br />\nvacancy and everyone from McCulloch down moved up a<br />\nstep on the ladder. Vogelstein and Little were easy<br />\nIvrinners in their regular spots with scores of 6-3, 6-2, and<br />\n6-1, 6-3, respectively. McCulloch, Levin and Feinberg, all<br />\nin their new positions, also chalked up victories by<br /><br />\nrespective scores of 6-1,.7-5; 6-1, 6-1; and 6-3, 6-4. The<br />\nonly loss the Jays suffered in the contests came when<br />\nGrohol dropped his match in straight sets 6-4,64.<br />\nAgain, the Jay tennis bums swept the doubles portion<br />\nof the game. This time, though, Coach Bob Hughes<br />\nshuffled up his team play lineup. This strategic move<br />\nproved effective as Vogelstein and McCulloch, elevated to<br />\nthe first slot, Little and Levin, and Feinberg and Grohol<br />\ntook their matches 6-1, 2-6, 6-4; 6-1, 64; and 64, 6-0,<br />\nrespectively.<br />\nThese two huge victories seemed to amply make up for<br />\nthe two disappointing losses the Blue Jays were handed<br />\ntwo weeks ago. On April 8, the team traveled to<br />\nWashington, D.C. to face Catholic University.<br />\nUnfortunately, the Jays had to forfeit the second doubles<br />\nmatch and the third doubles contest fell by the wayside<br /><br />\ndue. t dar ness. McCulloch and Feinberg in singles, and<br />\nthe doubles tandem of Little and Mont were the, only<br />\nvictorious netmen. The scores read 4-6, 7-6,64;6-3,6-0;<br />\nand 64,6-3, respectively.<br />\nA powerful Towson State club whipped th Jays Here<br />\non April 11 by the count of 8-1. On this occasion Little<br />\nand Mont were team victors with a 64,64 score.<br />\nIndividually<br />\neinberg tops the team with a ; -'4<br />\nsingles record with Little and McCulloch just behind<br />\nsporting 4-5 records. The doubles duo of McCulloch and<br />\nVogelstein rate number one for the Jays in that category<br />\nwith a 4-2 showing.<br />\nThe Blue Jays next home match will ta 6 place this<br />\nThursday when the team faces MAC rival Ursinus College.<br />\nThe context is set to get underway at 3 pm on the tennis<br />\ncourts behind the new dorms.<br /><br />\nbermuda sports shorts<br />\nA new exercise activity has been opened by the<br />\nAthletic Department.<br />\nIt is called a \"circuit course,\" is located in the old<br />\nping-pong room in the lower front hall of the Athletic<br />\nCenter, and is designed primarily for those of any age and<br />\neither sex who want a simple, consistent, non-organized<br />\narrangement by/ hich they can wor out to improve their<br />\nphysical condition in a minimum of time.<br />\nIt requires no prior lcnowlege or experience in athletics.<br />\nor physical training, uses simple calisthenic-type exercises,<br />\nand can be carried out at any intensity the user prefers.<br />\nThe instructions are self-explanatory, so that no formal.<br />\ninstruction is needed to begin, and users can go through<br />\nthe course at their own convenienced rather than in an<br />\norganized class arrangement.<br />\nStudents and faculty are being invited to examine \\the<br />\ncirduit course to see if it provides a simple but effective<br />\nmethod for \"getting in shape\" with a minimum of ,time<br /><br />\nspent each week.
