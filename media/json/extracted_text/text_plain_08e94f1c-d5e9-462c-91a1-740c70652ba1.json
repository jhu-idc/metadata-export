As a<br />\nfreshman and a newcomer to<br />\nHopkins, I was pleased that the<br />\nBlue Jay debaters seemed to be<br />\nwinning hands down. It had<br />\nsurprised me, though, tha I was<br />\nthe only spectator in the<br />\nenormous auditorium,. Is<br />\nanybody there? Does anybody<br />\ncare? I asked myself.<br />\n\"Don't feel downhearted,little<br />\nfellow. I care. I appreciate your<br />\nsupport here today,\" a<br />\nwell-modulated voice addressed<br />\nme. I judged from the rhinestone<br />\nletters on his suit that my<br />\ncomforter was none other than<br />\nBig Ed Brokans himself, author,<br />\nparliamentarian, orator, and<br />\npolitical adviser to student<br />\ngovernments. I was pleasantly<br />\nshocked that somehow so<br />\nimportant a personage would<br />\ntake the time out to talk to a<br />\nhumble freshman. I was further<br />\nsurpised when Mr. Brokans'<br />\nopponents conceded him victory<br />\nbefore the debates even started.<br />\n, Such. was this man's reputation!<br />\n\"I have won enough trophies<br />\nfor Hopkins to fill all the steam<br />\ntunnels seven times over,\" he<br />\nexplained to me over milk and<br />\ncookies at the Rathskellar.\"Why<br />\ndo I bother, you may ask, when<br />\n<br />\nyou know we don't have room<br />\nanywhere for all of them and<br />\nthey have to be melted down or<br />\nelse thrown in the dumpster.<br />\nWell, I'll tell you. I don't do it<br />\nfor the fame I do it because I<br />\nrealize that I am the heir of a<br />\ngreat oral tradition.<br />\nSinglehandedly I have kept the<br />\nesoteric art of debate alive at this<br />\nschool. When all around me<br />\nfuzzy -brained cretins are<br />\npolluting the air with \"well,\"<br />\n\"Like,\" and the ineluctable \"you<br />\nknow,\" I remain a bastion of<br />\narticulate speech.\"<br />\nHow to shaft<br />\nI knew right there and then<br />\nthat I had found in Ed Brokans a<br />\nmodel worth emulating. Under<br />\nhis guidance, I learned how to<br />\n<br />\nput witnesses on the spot at<br />\nS.A.C. meetings, how to draw up<br />\nconstitutions, how to tear apart<br />\nothers' constitutions, how to run<br />\na meeting, how to walk out of a<br />\nmeeting somebody else is<br />\nrunning, and above all, how to<br />\nwin by intimidation.<br />\nWho knows what further<br />\nheights I would have attained<br />\nwith such a man as my teacher,<br />\nhad not a tragic accident on C<br />\nlevel buried our distinguished<br />\ndebate council president and<br />\nresident constitutionalist under<br />\nan avalanche of law books.

We are grateful for<br />\nthe pleasant patronization of<br />\nthose who came and were not<br />\nonly patient, but complimentary<br />\nof our project.

And while we were a little<br />\ndisappointed that more juniors<br />\nweren't willing to help out, we<br />\njust can't thank enough our<br />\nfriends who devoted so much<br />\ntime and effort to working at the<br />\nbreakfast, making it a success.<br />\nHopefully, next year we'll have<br />\nmore people working, and things<br />\nwill be a little easier on everyone.<br />\nOnce again\u2014thanks folks!<br />\nThe Junior Class Officers<br />\n<br />\nTo the Editor:<br />\nFar be it from me to wish to<br />\ncensor the student press.

Ed.<br />\nClass entitled simply, \"Health.\"<br />\nAfter attempting for several days<br />\nto depict the heartbreak and<br />\nfailure of the \"marijuana junkie\"<br />\nMr. Demske tossed his narcotic<br />\nmanual in a handcar to hell and<br />\nsaid with a grin; \"All right,<br />\nenough of that crap. Who wants<br />\nto get high?\" Sure enough, after<br />\na few hesitant moments of<br />\nscanning the classroom to see<br />\nwho was going to make the<br />\nPlunge, all of the eighteen<br />\nstudents threw their right hand<br />\ninto the air, much to the pleasure<br />\nof our instructor, who after this<br />\nliberation was familiarly referred<br />\nto as the good Dr. Demski or<br />\nUncle Walt.<br />\nWell, for the remaining week<br />\n<br />\nof Health Class we got stoned as<br />\nhell. Uncle Walt spoke about the<br />\ndifference between Mexican and<br />\nColumbian weed, how to smuggle<br />\nblack hashish from afghanistan<br />\nand why Top's rolling papers<br />\nafford a smoother smoke than<br />\nZig-Zag's. He showed us how to<br />\ncut a quarter pound, roach a<br />\njoint and clean a clay pipe. It was<br />\na tribute to the sophistication of<br />\nSuffolk County's youth that not<br />\none of us was suckered into a five<br />\ndollar bag of catnip.<br />\nBut my courtship with drugs<br />\ndidn't end with the good doctor's<br />\ncourse. Every day we would cut<br />\nclass, and cluster in the woods<br />\nbehind the school, tokin' and<br />\nsnortin' our brains out! And<br />\nwhile not everyone was dodging<br />\nthe \"intolerable reality\" that<br />\nsome hygiene teacher from<br />\nBergen County, N.J. dreamed up,<br />\n<br />\nit wasn't a flu epidemic that<br />\nemptied the case of Visine eye<br />\ndrops that grocer Wilson kept<br />\nbehind the counter.<br />\nOnce I mastered the ins and<br />\nouts of dope smoking, I turned<br />\nto the \"other poisons\" that were<br />\njust begging to be consumed.<br />\nBeer and acid, whiskey and<br />\nKools. And by my junior year I<br />\nwas so versed in illegal substances<br />\nthat Mr. Demske chose two<br />\nfriends and I to represent our<br />\nclass in the annual Trivia Bowl.<br />\nWith the aid of a couple bottles<br />\nof Cold Duck and three bongs of<br />\nhomegrown we took the contest<br />\nfaster than you could say \"John<br />\nDenver for a natural high!\"<br />\nBut now, after years of<br />\nchemically-induced evasion of<br />\nreality, a new element is coming<br />\ninto play for the addled cowboys<br />\nof this world. One of my friends,<br />\n<br />\nyou see, his mind is breaking<br />\ndown. He's been seen in<br />\nwhirlwinds, uprooting pot plants,<br />\noverturning infirmary pill<br />\ncannisters and angrily crushing<br />\nbeer cans. He goes blank at the<br />\nsight of an alkie, yelling<br />\n\"drunken lout, always roaming<br />\naround, spitting and sputtering,<br />\nI'll settle his hash, you bet I<br />\nwill!\"<br />\nAnd so, my friend who has<br />\nbeen dubbed \"Mr. Rocky<br />\nMountain High\" by some of my<br />\nless generous drugged cronies, is<br />\nrunning in circles with a pitiful<br />\nquioxtic gleam in his eyes,<br />\nchanting continuously \"I will not<br />\nsmoke pot, I will not smoke<br />\npot.\" The nurses say that he'll<br />\nget over this obsession and that<br />\nit's just a phase that many Bergen<br />\nCounty youths are suffering<br />\nthrough right now. But when I<br />\n<br />\ntold the doctor that my friend's<br />\ncase was indeed serious and not<br />\njust a case of the \"Carrie Nation<br />\ndelusions,\" he said to keep the<br />\npatient guarded, gag him tight<br />\nand maybe in a few weeks they'd<br />\npatch him up.<br />\nAlarmed by the sight of my<br />\ncrusading friend last weekend,<br />\nattempting, in a self-righteous<br />\nstupor to empty nine codeine<br />\nbottles at once, even I began to<br />\nquestion his misdirected zeal.<br />\nThat was a mistake. Before I<br />\ncould complete a sentence he<br />\ngrabbed my shirt and escorted<br />\nme to a table filled with drunken<br />\ndruggies. On and on he raged<br />\nabout shrunken livers, splintered<br />\nlungs and wasted bodies. He<br />\nconcluded with a plea to go<br />\nstraight and face a world filled<br />\nwith \"injustice, despair and<br />\nanxiety.\"<br />\nThere were no buyers.<br />\n<br />\nBarnduster's 'Our Town'a Heralded success--see it!!<br />\nBY ALAN FINK<br />\nThis past Wednesday, the John<br />\nHopkins school play was<br />\npresented in the Listening-Viewing room for the behalf of<br />\nthe student body. The play was<br />\nput on by the Barndusters, the<br />\ndrama group at John Hopkins,<br />\nafter three weeks of rehearsal.<br />\nThe Play, entitled \"Our Town,\"<br />\nwas written by the John Hopkins<br />\nPlaYwrighting class. According to<br />\nMr. Arellano, the play was a cross<br />\nbetween \"Arsenic and Old Lace,\"<br />\nthe well-known Brooklyn drama,<br />\nand Harold Pinter's \"The<br />\nStrangled Octopus.\" Mr. Arellano<br />\nsaid that the class was striving for<br />\na \"composite literary<br />\nachievement.\" Last year, the<br />\nPlaywrighting class did an<br />\nupdated take-off on Carroll's<br />\n\"Alice in Wonderland.\"<br />\nHERALD feels that the play was<br />\nwell-executed and reflected<br />\n<br />\nmonths of arderous preparation<br />\nby the Barndusters and other<br />\nparticipants. The male lead was<br />\nplayed by Alan Fink, who is<br />\nTreasurer of Barndusters. Alan<br />\nplayed a New York journalist<br />\nwho was plagued by recurring<br />\nvisions of portals to the fifth<br />\ndimension. He wants to marry his<br />\nnext-door neighbor in Flatbush<br />\nbut fears that she is in league<br />\nwith a modern-day<br />\nMephistopholes in a plot to kill<br />\noff the world's octopi.<br />\nWhite Man's Culture<br />\nAlan did an excellent job in<br />\nportraiting this difficult role. Mr.<br />\nArellano feels that Alan acted<br />\nwell too, since the role \"was<br />\novertly symbolic\u2014the class wrote<br />\nthat character with the idea of<br />\nfusing Cary Grant with Pinter's<br />\nUberwilde. This was, of course, a<br />\nproblematic synthesis, aimed<br />\nmore at the heart than the head.\"<br />\n<br />\n\"<br />\n<br />\n111 a jail<br />\n<br />\n* 1<br />\n<br />\n4 sons*<br />\nst.41\"'<br />\n..<br />\nsi \u2022i',<br />\ns<br />\n<br />\nAlan Fink<br />\n<br />\nThe female lead was played by<br />\nTheresa Wiggins, who is Secretary<br />\nof Barndusters. Herald feels that<br />\nTheresa did an excellent job in<br />\nplaying the role of a Brooklyn<br />\nsecretary who claims to have<br />\nbeen raped by Lucifer. Mr.<br />\nArellano said that Theresa did a<br />\ngood job in portraiting this most<br />\ndifficult character which Mr.<br />\nArellano said was \"meant to<br />\nconvey the basic indecency of<br />\nthe White man's culture.\"<br />\n\"The symbolism of the<br />\noctopi,\" said Mr. Arellano, \"is<br />\nintended to reflect .the<br />\npreoccupation of interpretation<br />\nin Anglo Saxon culture, that<br />\nAmerican consider themselves<br />\nthe highest of the scholarly<br />\nexegetes. The octopi are meant<br />\nto incite myriad well-intentioned<br />\nattempts at symbolic explication.<br />\nBetween me and you, they don't<br />\nmean a damn thing.\"<br />\n<br />\nOther actors in this play were<br />\nalso excellent. Norman<br />\nSchlossbergcr did a superlately<br />\njob of portraiting Urno, a<br />\nSamoan attorney who is<br />\nentrusted with \"dispatching the<br />\noctopi,\u2014 according to Mr.<br />\nArellano.<br />\n!Conclusion<br />\nMr. Arellano said he was<br />\noverall very satisfied with the<br />\nplay and hopes that the<br />\nproduction will encourage other<br />\nwould-be playwrights to joint the<br />\nJohn Hopkins playwrighting<br />\nclass. HERALD agrees and we<br />\nhope that Mr. Arellano will<br />\nattempt to do more \"literary<br />\ncomposites\" in the future such as<br />\n\"Our Town\" which HERALD<br />\nfeels was at least as good as<br />\n\"Alice in Wonderland,\" which<br />\nwas presented last year.<br />\nIn short, a good time was had<br />\nby all.<br />\n<br />\nHerald expose<br />\n<br />\nJoseph (Jakie) Hall is one heckuva guy for a Dean!<br />\nBy RON BIALEK<br />\nand<br />\nSTEVE PONCHAK<br />\nHERALD recently interviewed<br />\nour Dean of Students, Joseph S.<br />\nHall.

And<br />\nif nothing else it revealed what<br />\neverybody else already knew:<br />\nJakie is one heckava guy.\"<br />\nHERALD: What, if anything,<br />\nis Hopkins doing about the Cafe?<br />\nJakie: Well, I've talked to the<br />\npeople at Saga, and I've heard<br />\nthem loud and clear. I've talked<br />\nto the students. And I've heard<br />\nthem loud and clear. Now, I'm<br />\ngoing to evaluate both positions,<br />\nand then we'll go from there. I<br />\nthink both sides have valid<br />\npoints. I don't think it would be<br />\nfair of me to say at this time<br />\nwhich is more valid, in terms of<br />\nright or wrong. I am looking at<br />\nthe question, that's about all I<br />\n<br />\ncan say.<br />\nHERALD: What do you think<br />\nof the Student Council's<br />\nCommunity Committee?<br />\nJakie. I think that, in terms of<br />\nan action, it's a really_ good<br />\nattempt to get feedback. This is<br />\nreally just another part of an<br />\noverall action within the<br />\nUniversity to generate feedback<br />\nfrom the community to the<br />\nUniversity. In terms of student<br />\naction, I think it's a great start.<br />\nOf course, in terms of results, I<br />\nreally can't say what's going to<br />\ncome of it.<br />\nHERALD: Do you think<br />\nthere's a chance it will succeed.<br />\nJakie: Well, again, I really<br />\ncan't say, but I think it's fair to<br />\nassume that there may be a<br />\nchance.<br />\nHERALD: What's up with the<br />\nInfirmary.<br />\nJakie: The infirmary? Really,<br />\nthis is the first I've heard of it.<br />\nHERALD: You've never heard<br />\n<br />\nJakie flail<br />\n<br />\nof the Infirmary?<br />\nJakie: Oh no, I meant I hadn't<br />\nheard about any concerns voiced<br />\nby students, in terms of the<br />\nInfirmary. I certainly will talk to<br />\neveryone involved. I guess I'll<br />\nhave to take a crash course in<br />\nInfirmary problems.<br />\nHERALD: Jakie, could you<br />\nexplain your position, for our<br />\nreaders, your position in the<br />\ntakeover of the school paper.<br />\nJakie: Well, I talked to both<br />\nsides; and they both had good<br />\npoints to make. But I hate to<br />\nfavor one side over the other, so<br />\nI'll wait until all inputs are in<br />\nbefore I do or say, in terms of a<br />\ndecision.<br />\nHERALD: One last thing<br />\nJakie. Will you chaperone the<br />\n\"Night out at the Grad Club\"<br />\nthis Saturday nitght?<br />\nJakie: Why, I, uh don't know<br />\nwhat to say...I mean I guess so...I<br />\nmean I don't see why not.

Dr. Rogers (Mr. Abel) is the chief of the Bureau of Sexological<br />\nResearch located, according to the film, in Grant's Tomb, and so busy these days that the bureau<br />\nis adding what it calls its Dolly Madison wing.<br />\nThe movie, which is now at the Cinema Rendezvous, is, critally speaking, anarchic, superficially<br />\ndirty, often crude, and so exhuberant that it sometimes doesn't know when to stop. It is also,<br />\nmore than half of the time, very, very, funny. In short, it belongs to that honorable tradition of<br />\ncollege humor that has been more or less forgotten on the campuses, and that might have been lost<br />\nentirely if it weren't for films by people like Woody Allen, Robert Downey, and Briar De Palma.<br />\n\"Is There Sex After Death?\" is not, I realize, a movie for everybody. It's not for those people<br />\nwho mistake the fancily edited adolescent jokes of \"Laugh-In\" for what I think of as college<br />\nhumor. It's not for people so far removed from Gomorrah that they won't know exactly what the<br />\nmovie is kidding. Indeed, if audiences haven't endured their fill of revolutionary literature (the sex<br />\nnewspapers as well as scholarly treatises on the demographics of, say, foot fetishism), or haven't<br />\nsat through pious, educational TV panel discussions or group sex, they may be inclined to take \"Is<br />\nThere Sex After Death?\" as an example of the very phenomenon it insists on having its cheerful<br />\nway with. To the extent that the film could nto exist without the permissiveness that prompts it,<br />\nand that the film makes full use of it is, of course, a part of the phenomenon. However, its mind is<br />\nso sane, its imagination so free, and its fanta4es so logical, that it becomes something even more<br />\nrare than good satire, that is, it becomes good dirty satire.<br />\nThe form of the film is of an almost epic looseness of the kind that sends some movie critics off<br />\nto write condescending reviews, right after they've spend an hour or so laughing with it.

I judged from the rhinestone<br />\nletters on his suit that my<br />\ncomforter was none other than<br />\nBig Ed Brokans himself, author,<br />\nparliamentarian, orator, and<br />\npolitical adviser to student<br />\ngovernments. I was pleasantly<br />\nshocked that somehow so<br />\nimportant a personage would<br />\ntake the time out to talk to a<br />\nhumble freshman. I was further<br />\nsurpised when Mr. Brokans'<br />\nopponents conceded him victory<br />\nbefore the debates even started.<br />\n, Such. was this man's reputation!<br />\n\"I have won enough trophies<br />\nfor Hopkins to fill all the steam<br />\ntunnels seven times over,\" he<br />\nexplained to me over milk and<br />\ncookies at the Rathskellar.\"Why<br />\ndo I bother, you may ask, when<br /><br />\nyou know we don't have room<br />\nanywhere for all of them and<br />\nthey have to be melted down or<br />\nelse thrown in the dumpster.<br />\nWell, I'll tell you.

We are grateful for<br />\nthe pleasant patronization of<br />\nthose who came and were not<br />\nonly patient, but complimentary<br />\nof our project. We are impressed<br />\nwith and indebted to Saga,<br />\nbecause of the smoothness of the<br />\noperation and their willingness to<br />\nhelp in any way they could,<br />\nbesides providing top-quality<br />\nfood. And while we were a little<br />\ndisappointed that more juniors<br />\nweren't willing to help out, we<br />\njust can't thank enough our<br />\nfriends who devoted so much<br />\ntime and effort to working at the<br />\nbreakfast, making it a success.<br />\nHopefully, next year we'll have<br />\nmore people working, and things<br />\nwill be a little easier on everyone.<br />\nOnce again\u2014thanks folks!<br />\nThe Junior Class Officers<br /><br />\nTo the Editor:<br />\nFar be it from me to wish to<br />\ncensor the student press.

Who wants<br />\nto get high?\" Sure enough, after<br />\na few hesitant moments of<br />\nscanning the classroom to see<br />\nwho was going to make the<br />\nPlunge, all of the eighteen<br />\nstudents threw their right hand<br />\ninto the air, much to the pleasure<br />\nof our instructor, who after this<br />\nliberation was familiarly referred<br />\nto as the good Dr. Demski or<br />\nUncle Walt.<br />\nWell, for the remaining week<br /><br />\nof Health Class we got stoned as<br />\nhell. Uncle Walt spoke about the<br />\ndifference between Mexican and<br />\nColumbian weed, how to smuggle<br />\nblack hashish from afghanistan<br />\nand why Top's rolling papers<br />\nafford a smoother smoke than<br />\nZig-Zag's. He showed us how to<br />\ncut a quarter pound, roach a<br />\njoint and clean a clay pipe. It was<br />\na tribute to the sophistication of<br />\nSuffolk County's youth that not<br />\none of us was suckered into a five<br />\ndollar bag of catnip.<br />\nBut my courtship with drugs<br />\ndidn't end with the good doctor's<br />\ncourse. Every day we would cut<br />\nclass, and cluster in the woods<br />\nbehind the school, tokin' and<br />\nsnortin' our brains out! And<br />\nwhile not everyone was dodging<br />\nthe \"intolerable reality\" that<br />\nsome hygiene teacher from<br />\nBergen County, N.J. dreamed up,<br /><br />\nit wasn't a flu epidemic that<br />\nemptied the case of Visine eye<br />\ndrops that grocer Wilson kept<br />\nbehind the counter.<br />\nOnce I mastered the ins and<br />\nouts of dope smoking, I turned<br />\nto the \"other poisons\" that were<br />\njust begging to be consumed.<br />\nBeer and acid, whiskey and<br />\nKools. And by my junior year I<br />\nwas so versed in illegal substances<br />\nthat Mr. Demske chose two<br />\nfriends and I to represent our<br />\nclass in the annual Trivia Bowl.<br />\nWith the aid of a couple bottles<br />\nof Cold Duck and three bongs of<br />\nhomegrown we took the contest<br />\nfaster than you could say \"John<br />\nDenver for a natural high!\"<br />\nBut now, after years of<br />\nchemically-induced evasion of<br />\nreality, a new element is coming<br />\ninto play for the addled cowboys<br />\nof this world. One of my friends,<br /><br />\nyou see, his mind is breaking<br />\ndown. He's been seen in<br />\nwhirlwinds, uprooting pot plants,<br />\noverturning infirmary pill<br />\ncannisters and angrily crushing<br />\nbeer cans. He goes blank at the<br />\nsight of an alkie, yelling<br />\n\"drunken lout, always roaming<br />\naround, spitting and sputtering,<br />\nI'll settle his hash, you bet I<br />\nwill!\"<br />\nAnd so, my friend who has<br />\nbeen dubbed \"Mr. Rocky<br />\nMountain High\" by some of my<br />\nless generous drugged cronies, is<br />\nrunning in circles with a pitiful<br />\nquioxtic gleam in his eyes,<br />\nchanting continuously \"I will not<br />\nsmoke pot, I will not smoke<br />\npot.\" The nurses say that he'll<br />\nget over this obsession and that<br />\nit's just a phase that many Bergen<br />\nCounty youths are suffering<br />\nthrough right now. But when I<br /><br />\ntold the doctor that my friend's<br />\ncase was indeed serious and not<br />\njust a case of the \"Carrie Nation<br />\ndelusions,\" he said to keep the<br />\npatient guarded, gag him tight<br />\nand maybe in a few weeks they'd<br />\npatch him up.<br />\nAlarmed by the sight of my<br />\ncrusading friend last weekend,<br />\nattempting, in a self-righteous<br />\nstupor to empty nine codeine<br />\nbottles at once, even I began to<br />\nquestion his misdirected zeal.<br />\nThat was a mistake. Before I<br />\ncould complete a sentence he<br />\ngrabbed my shirt and escorted<br />\nme to a table filled with drunken<br />\ndruggies. On and on he raged<br />\nabout shrunken livers, splintered<br />\nlungs and wasted bodies. He<br />\nconcluded with a plea to go<br />\nstraight and face a world filled<br />\nwith \"injustice, despair and<br />\nanxiety.\"<br />\nThere were no buyers.<br /><br />\nBarnduster's 'Our Town'a Heralded success--see it!!<br />\nBY ALAN FINK<br />\nThis past Wednesday, the John<br />\nHopkins school play was<br />\npresented in the Listening-Viewing room for the behalf of<br />\nthe student body. The play was<br />\nput on by the Barndusters, the<br />\ndrama group at John Hopkins,<br />\nafter three weeks of rehearsal.<br />\nThe Play, entitled \"Our Town,\"<br />\nwas written by the John Hopkins<br />\nPlaYwrighting class. According to<br />\nMr. Arellano, the play was a cross<br />\nbetween \"Arsenic and Old Lace,\"<br />\nthe well-known Brooklyn drama,<br />\nand Harold Pinter's \"The<br />\nStrangled Octopus.\" Mr. Arellano<br />\nsaid that the class was striving for<br />\na \"composite literary<br />\nachievement.\" Last year, the<br />\nPlaywrighting class did an<br />\nupdated take-off on Carroll's<br />\n\"Alice in Wonderland.\"<br />\nHERALD feels that the play was<br />\nwell-executed and reflected<br /><br />\nmonths of arderous preparation<br />\nby the Barndusters and other<br />\nparticipants. The male lead was<br />\nplayed by Alan Fink, who is<br />\nTreasurer of Barndusters. Alan<br />\nplayed a New York journalist<br />\nwho was plagued by recurring<br />\nvisions of portals to the fifth<br />\ndimension. He wants to marry his<br />\nnext-door neighbor in Flatbush<br />\nbut fears that she is in league<br />\nwith a modern-day<br />\nMephistopholes in a plot to kill<br />\noff the world's octopi.<br />\nWhite Man's Culture<br />\nAlan did an excellent job in<br />\nportraiting this difficult role. Mr.<br />\nArellano feels that Alan acted<br />\nwell too, since the role \"was<br />\novertly symbolic\u2014the class wrote<br />\nthat character with the idea of<br />\nfusing Cary Grant with Pinter's<br />\nUberwilde. This was, of course, a<br />\nproblematic synthesis, aimed<br />\nmore at the heart than the head.\"<br /><br />\n\"<br /><br />\n111 a jail<br /><br />\n* 1<br /><br />\n4 sons*<br />\nst.41\"'<br />\n..<br />\nsi \u2022i',<br />\ns<br /><br />\nAlan Fink<br /><br />\nThe female lead was played by<br />\nTheresa Wiggins, who is Secretary<br />\nof Barndusters. Herald feels that<br />\nTheresa did an excellent job in<br />\nplaying the role of a Brooklyn<br />\nsecretary who claims to have<br />\nbeen raped by Lucifer. Mr.<br />\nArellano said that Theresa did a<br />\ngood job in portraiting this most<br />\ndifficult character which Mr.<br />\nArellano said was \"meant to<br />\nconvey the basic indecency of<br />\nthe White man's culture.\"<br />\n\"The symbolism of the<br />\noctopi,\" said Mr. Arellano, \"is<br />\nintended to reflect .the<br />\npreoccupation of interpretation<br />\nin Anglo Saxon culture, that<br />\nAmerican consider themselves<br />\nthe highest of the scholarly<br />\nexegetes. The octopi are meant<br />\nto incite myriad well-intentioned<br />\nattempts at symbolic explication.<br />\nBetween me and you, they don't<br />\nmean a damn thing.\"<br /><br />\nOther actors in this play were<br />\nalso excellent. Norman<br />\nSchlossbergcr did a superlately<br />\njob of portraiting Urno, a<br />\nSamoan attorney who is<br />\nentrusted with \"dispatching the<br />\noctopi,\u2014 according to Mr.<br />\nArellano.<br />\n!Conclusion<br />\nMr. Arellano said he was<br />\noverall very satisfied with the<br />\nplay and hopes that the<br />\nproduction will encourage other<br />\nwould-be playwrights to joint the<br />\nJohn Hopkins playwrighting<br />\nclass. HERALD agrees and we<br />\nhope that Mr. Arellano will<br />\nattempt to do more \"literary<br />\ncomposites\" in the future such as<br />\n\"Our Town\" which HERALD<br />\nfeels was at least as good as<br />\n\"Alice in Wonderland,\" which<br />\nwas presented last year.<br />\nIn short, a good time was had<br />\nby all.<br /><br />\nHerald expose<br /><br />\nJoseph (Jakie) Hall is one heckuva guy for a Dean!<br />\nBy RON BIALEK<br />\nand<br />\nSTEVE PONCHAK<br />\nHERALD recently interviewed<br />\nour Dean of Students, Joseph S.<br />\nHall.

I've talked<br />\nto the students. And I've heard<br />\nthem loud and clear. Now, I'm<br />\ngoing to evaluate both positions,<br />\nand then we'll go from there. I<br />\nthink both sides have valid<br />\npoints. I don't think it would be<br />\nfair of me to say at this time<br />\nwhich is more valid, in terms of<br />\nright or wrong. I am looking at<br />\nthe question, that's about all I<br /><br />\ncan say.<br />\nHERALD: What do you think<br />\nof the Student Council's<br />\nCommunity Committee?<br />\nJakie. I think that, in terms of<br />\nan action, it's a really_ good<br />\nattempt to get feedback. This is<br />\nreally just another part of an<br />\noverall action within the<br />\nUniversity to generate feedback<br />\nfrom the community to the<br />\nUniversity. In terms of student<br />\naction, I think it's a great start.<br />\nOf course, in terms of results, I<br />\nreally can't say what's going to<br />\ncome of it.<br />\nHERALD: Do you think<br />\nthere's a chance it will succeed.<br />\nJakie: Well, again, I really<br />\ncan't say, but I think it's fair to<br />\nassume that there may be a<br />\nchance.<br />\nHERALD: What's up with the<br />\nInfirmary.<br />\nJakie: The infirmary? Really,<br />\nthis is the first I've heard of it.<br />\nHERALD: You've never heard<br /><br />\nJakie flail<br /><br />\nof the Infirmary?<br />\nJakie: Oh no, I meant I hadn't<br />\nheard about any concerns voiced<br />\nby students, in terms of the<br />\nInfirmary. I certainly will talk to<br />\neveryone involved. I guess I'll<br />\nhave to take a crash course in<br />\nInfirmary problems.<br />\nHERALD: Jakie, could you<br />\nexplain your position, for our<br />\nreaders, your position in the<br />\ntakeover of the school paper.<br />\nJakie: Well, I talked to both<br />\nsides; and they both had good<br />\npoints to make. But I hate to<br />\nfavor one side over the other, so<br />\nI'll wait until all inputs are in<br />\nbefore I do or say, in terms of a<br />\ndecision.<br />\nHERALD: One last thing<br />\nJakie.

Dr. Rogers (Mr. Abel) is the chief of the Bureau of Sexological<br />\nResearch located, according to the film, in Grant's Tomb, and so busy these days that the bureau<br />\nis adding what it calls its Dolly Madison wing.<br />\nThe movie, which is now at the Cinema Rendezvous, is, critally speaking, anarchic, superficially<br />\ndirty, often crude, and so exhuberant that it sometimes doesn't know when to stop. It is also,<br />\nmore than half of the time, very, very, funny. In short, it belongs to that honorable tradition of<br />\ncollege humor that has been more or less forgotten on the campuses, and that might have been lost<br />\nentirely if it weren't for films by people like Woody Allen, Robert Downey, and Briar De Palma.<br />\n\"Is There Sex After Death?\" is not, I realize, a movie for everybody. It's not for those people<br />\nwho mistake the fancily edited adolescent jokes of \"Laugh-In\" for what I think of as college<br />\nhumor. It's not for people so far removed from Gomorrah that they won't know exactly what the<br />\nmovie is kidding. Indeed, if audiences haven't endured their fill of revolutionary literature (the sex<br />\nnewspapers as well as scholarly treatises on the demographics of, say, foot fetishism), or haven't<br />\nsat through pious, educational TV panel discussions or group sex, they may be inclined to take \"Is<br />\nThere Sex After Death?\" as an example of the very phenomenon it insists on having its cheerful<br />\nway with. To the extent that the film could nto exist without the permissiveness that prompts it,<br />\nand that the film makes full use of it is, of course, a part of the phenomenon. However, its mind is<br />\nso sane, its imagination so free, and its fanta4es so logical, that it becomes something even more<br />\nrare than good satire, that is, it becomes good dirty satire.<br />\nThe form of the film is of an almost epic looseness of the kind that sends some movie critics off<br />\nto write condescending reviews, right after they've spend an hour or so laughing with it.
