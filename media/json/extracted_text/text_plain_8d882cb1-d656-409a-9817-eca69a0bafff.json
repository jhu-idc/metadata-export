The win was the fourteenth consecutive in the regular season for<br />\nthe Blue Jays and the fourth straight over<br />\nthe Tar Heels.<br />\nHopkins, which is now 6-0 and ranked<br />\nnumber one in both the USILA and Sun<br />\npolls, jumped out to a 1-0 lead just 1:06<br />\ninto the game when senior midfielder<br />\nBrendan Kelly scored off an assist from<br />\nJeff Ihm. The Tar Heels answered right<br />\nback, however, scoring three unanswered<br />\ngoals, including two by attackman Neill<br />\nRedfern.<br />\nThe two teams began trading goals for<br />\nthe rest of the first half, as Hopkins failed<br />\nto control the tempo and run their ball-<br />\n<br />\ncontrol offense. After goals by Johns<br />\nWilkens and Matt Panetta had tied the<br />\ngame for Hopkins at the close of the first<br />\nquarter, Dennis Goldstein put the Tar<br />\nHeels back on top 4-3 by scoring on a fast<br />\nbreak just ten seconds into the second<br />\nquarter. Wilkens once again evened the<br />\nscore 2:54 into the quarter, and after each<br />\nteam tallied to make it 5-5, neither Hopkins<br />\nnor Carolina scored for the final 8:20 of<br />\nthe first half.<br />\n\"We did not execute well at all in the<br />\nfirst half of the ball game,\" commented<br />\nHopkins Coach Don Zimmerman. \"We<br />\nweren't doing things the way we should be<br />\ndoing them.

According to Klupt, the committee tried<br />\nto come up with a \"realistic list\"<br />\nof potential speakers. \"We were<br />\n<br />\nwriting letters to potential tion or to the twelve weekly<br />\nspeakers from November to phone calls the committee made<br />\nDecember,\" he said. \"We tried to his office.<br />\nMany senators, explained Fitzto get [Kansas Senator] Nancy<br />\nKassebaum,[former Secretary of Gerald, will not take the opporState] George Shultz\u2014[Drug tunity to speak unless he can have<br />\nCzar] William<br />\nBennett's a photo opportunity, or unless an<br />\nsecretary told us not to even Ivy League school is involved in<br />\nthe package.

Fortsch<br />\nA native of Louisville, KY,<br />\nSagar<br />\nLonial<br />\nis<br />\na<br />\nbiology/philosophy major who<br />\nwill graduate in June and attend<br />\nmedical school in the fall. In addition to these accomplishments,<br />\nLonial has another unique distinction of which to be proud. He has<br />\nbeen chosen as Young Trustee for<br />\nthe Class of 1989.<br />\nThe process began in March<br />\nwhen sophomores, juniors, and<br />\nseniors voted for the Young<br />\nTrustee, choosing five of twelve<br />\ncandidates on the ballot. Before<br />\nvoting, each Young Trustee candidate was required to submit an<br />\napplication entailing any relevant<br />\nbiographical information, his<br />\nfield of study, interests, and extracurricular activities, both at<br />\nHopkins and elsewhere.<br />\nAfter two sets of balloting, the<br />\nfive remaining trustee candidates<br />\nwent to the Nominating Committee of the Board of trustees,<br />\n<br />\nwhich interviewed each of the<br />\nfive finalists.<br />\nFollowing the interviewing<br />\nprocess, the Nominating Committee voted on which candidate<br />\nbest suited the position of Young<br />\nTrustee, and submitted their<br />\nrecommendation to the Board of<br />\nTrustees. Lonial was their choice.<br />\nThe Trustees approved the<br />\nnomination Monday.<br />\nA housemaster for two years as<br />\nwell as an admissions intern and<br />\nmember of the Blue Key Society, Lonial explained, \"This is an<br />\nimportant time in the University's<br />\nfuture, with the new president<br />\nand the Five-Year Plan. I am excited to be a part of what will<br />\nultimately be the future of<br />\nHopkins.\"<br />\nLonial decided to run for<br />\nYoung Trustee because \"I've enjoyed working with different people in many areas and I wanted<br />\nto continue. I will now be active<br />\nin a new and interesting way.\"<br />\n<br />\nJohn Misa<br />\n<br />\nDole, said FitzGerald, seemed<br />\nto be \"waiting for Harvard or<br />\nYale,\" to request him as a<br />\nspeaker, and therefore would not<br />\nmake a definite commitment to<br />\nHopkins either way.<br />\nThe selection committee also<br />\nhad other problems. It posted<br />\nadvertisements for its meetings,<br />\nbut these meetings attracted \"two<br />\nor three people, though these people worked really hard,\" according to Klupt. The chairs<br />\nlamented a lack of overall student<br />\nparticipation; only twenty<br />\nstudents responded to a survey<br />\nprinted in the News-Letter<br />\nsoliciting possible speaker<br />\nchoices.<br />\nAccording to Klupt, the<br />\nstudents\u2014not the University<br />\nadministration\u2014are charged with<br />\nfinding a senior class speaker.<br />\nUniversity policy may also<br />\nplace severe restrictions on the<br />\nselection of quality speakers. According to Dean of Students<br />\nSusan Boswell, the University<br />\n\"has strict policies regarding the<br />\ngranting of honorary degrees.\"<br />\nElected officials are not eligible<br />\nfor these degrees unless they are<br />\nheads of state who have \"made<br />\nexceptional contributions to<br />\nsociety.\"<br />\nUniversities sometimes find it<br />\neasier to attract high quality or<br />\nhigh profile speakers when they<br />\noffer their speakers honorary<br />\ndegrees, she said.<br />\nBoswell agreed with FitzGerald<br />\nthat \"there is not enough money\"<br />\nto attract speakers for the senior<br />\nclass. She said, though, that the<br />\nStudent Council funds the<br />\nspeaker's fee and that \"the Student Council got a substantial increase in funds this year.\"<br />\n<br />\nYoung Trustee Sagar Lonial<br />\n<br />\nSC reviews security, blocks Hott's run for office<br />\nby Craig Freeman<br />\nFormer Student Council<br />\nmember Cary Gross's declaration<br />\nthat \"the security around campus<br />\nis not sufficient\" captured the attention of Council members,<br />\nsparking a fifteen-minute discussion about Hopkins's responsibility to protect its students.<br />\nDuring Council's Wednesday<br />\nmeeting in the Shriver Board<br />\nRoom, Gross called \"watching<br />\nthe police extract a murder victim from the alley in St. Paul<br />\nCourt\" the incident that made the<br />\nissue such a pressing one. He implored Council to request tighter<br />\nsecurity and more security vans<br />\nto protect the Hopkins<br />\ncommunity.<br />\nCouncil President Lou<br />\nGiangiulio warned members not<br />\nto jump to conclusions. \"When<br />\nyou don't know all of the facts,<br />\nits hard to say Hopkins security<br />\nneeds to be tighter,\" said<br />\nGiangiulio. \"We need to have<br />\nmore legitimate student concerns<br />\nbefore\" Council brings the issue<br />\nto the administration.<br />\nIn response to his statement,<br />\nCouncil members began to list<br />\nproblems or criticisms with<br />\nsecurity.

He insisted that security need<br />\n<br />\nnot be restricted to campus boundaries, but be widened to encounpass all of Charles Village.<br />\nElection Commissions Chair<br />\nJen Willmann said, \"Hopkins is<br />\nneglecting their responsibility to<br />\nstudent, off University housing.\"<br />\nOthers added possible solutions<br />\nto security troubles, ranging from<br />\naddding more lights around campus to hiring security guards who<br />\nare licensed to carry weapons.<br />\nBefore the discussion ended,<br />\nGross brought up the point that<br />\n\"Hopkins is the second largest<br />\nlandowner in Baltimore. The [administration] has the power to talk<br />\nto the Baltimore City Council and<br />\nget more city police up here.\"<br />\nAs a result of the discussion,<br />\nCouncil decided to have a<br />\nmeeting in the AMR I Multipurpose Room with Dean of<br />\nHomewood Schools Services<br />\nChris Colombo and Security<br />\nChief Robert Larkin.

Some of the new<br />\nvendors will sell inlaid wood<br />\ncrafts, stained glass, wind<br />\nchimes, handmade flutes, and<br />\nhandpainted Ukrainian Easter<br />\neggs.<br />\nMirsky said, \"Even in the<br />\nmore common arts and crafts,<br />\nsuch as jewelry. . .there will be<br />\ndiverse types of media used to<br />\nmake these crafts.\" Some examples of these diverse media are<br />\njewelry made out of electronic<br />\ncircuits, paper, brass, ivory, and<br />\nthe traditional precious metals.<br />\nShe also said that the quality of<br />\nthe arts and crafts offered at Fair<br />\nwill be exceptionally high. Referring to last year's vendors, Mirsky said, \"If their stuff wasn't up<br />\nto the same quality level or was<br />\nmanufactured, then they were not<br />\nasked back.\" She added, \"We<br />\nhave very high quality stuff this<br />\nyear.\"<br />\nMansfield and Mirsky scouted<br />\nnew talent for Fair at a large arts<br />\nand crafts fair that took place this<br />\nspring at the Inner Harbor. The<br />\nvendors this year are from as far<br />\naway as Tennessee and Vermont,<br />\n<br />\nalthough many are from the local<br />\ncommunity. Commenting on the<br />\nease with which the arts and<br />\ncrafts committee attracted talent<br />\nthis year, Mirsky said, \"This Fair<br />\nhas a very good reputation.\"<br />\nAsked how this year's<br />\nMaritime '89 theme fits in with<br />\narts and crafts, Mirsky said the<br />\ntheme was especially popular<br />\nwith local vendors because<br />\n\". . .the harbor is the center of<br />\nlife in Baltimore.\" Many of the<br />\ncrafts offered this year will be<br />\ncentered on the maritime theme.<br />\nSome of these offerings include<br />\ndriftwood sculptures, seashell<br />\ncrafts, maritime theme silk<br />\nscreening, harbor prints, and fish<br />\nearrings. According to Mirsky,<br />\nthe vendors are going out of their<br />\nway to incorporate this year's<br />\ntheme into their crafts displays.<br />\nThis year's Fair also offers a<br />\nnumber of crafts booths for<br />\nchildren. One of the most notable<br />\nof these is a vendor who makes<br />\nmask kits for children called<br />\n\"Curiosity Kits.\" Each kit is based on a real type of mask and<br />\ncomes with an explanation of the<br />\nhistory behind the mask. These<br />\nkits are handmade especially for<br />\nchildren as educational toys.<br />\nSeveral other booths that<br />\nshould be interesting for children<br />\nare the handcarved Chinese<br />\ncheckers board booth, the wood<br />\ntoys booth, and the handprint tshirt booths.<br />\nTwo of the more exotic attractions will be a Tarot card reader<br />\nand a glass blower. The glass<br />\nblower will demonstrate from<br />\nstart to finish the ancient technique of glass blowing. His booth<br />\nwill be between Barton and<br />\nLatrobe Hall<br />\nMirsky sati this year's arts and<br />\n<br />\ncrafts section will be attractive to<br />\ncollege students. \"For the college<br />\ncommunity. . . we try to have<br />\nstuff they can afford,\" she said,<br />\nadding that the new booth run by<br />\nthe Fraternity Row store would<br />\noffer wares that will be popular<br />\namong students. Mirsky said of<br />\nHopkins students, \"I don't think<br />\nthey will be disappointed.\"<br />\nShe also said that many ,\u2022endors' applications for space were<br />\nturned down because the merchandise prices were deemed too<br />\nhigh for the Fair crowd. Mirsky<br />\nsaid, however,\"We really try to<br />\nhave something for everyone.\"<br />\nPast arts and crafts vendors<br />\nhave complained of theft problems. Mirsky said, \"It's very<br />\nhard to control what you have.<br />\nIt's an open Fair, so you can't<br />\nrestrict the people who come.\"<br />\n<br />\nAnchors aweigh!<br />\nHomewood rides<br />\nMaritime wave<br />\nby Steven Mizrach<br />\n\"Maritime '89.\" When else would you see inflatable tubes on the<br />\nlibrary?<br />\nThe Spring Fair Theme Committee has been hard at work on several<br />\nprojects. This year's theme committee chairs are seniors Michael Falk<br />\nand Grace Kung, and junior Nelson Tang. This year's theme is<br />\nnautical, hence the theme of Spring Fair is \"Maritime '89.\"<br />\nThe group's fifteen members have been meeting regularly since the<br />\nbeginning of January. As often happens, the group dismissed some<br />\nof its initial ideas as \"farfetched,\" such as turning Gilman Hall into<br />\na lighthouse.<br />\nThe committee decided to divide the campus into several areas: the<br />\narea in front of the Milton S. Eisenhower Library would appropriately<br />\nbe called the \"Beach,\" complete with artificial surf; especially for<br />\nkids area would become the \"Pirates' Cove,\" with ambling buccaneers; the Upper Quad would be the \"Upper Harbor,\" with sails<br />\nand nautical flags; and the Lower Quad would turn into \"Ten Thousand Leagues Beneath the Sea,\" complete with underwater creatures.<br />\nSince the traditional releasing of balloons is considered too much<br />\nof an environmental hazard, Fair chairs will instead dedicate the ship<br />\nS.S. Hopkins to begin the Fair. Tony Pagnotti, a reporter for WMARTV, will have the honors. As part of nighttime entertainment, the<br />\nGlass Pavilion will be turned into a \"fishbowl,\" and the Great Hall<br />\nwill be considered the deck of a ship.<br />\nMost of the committee's work in the last few weeks has involved<br />\ndecorating the campus. It has been busy designing the banners with<br />\nthe different area designations, and has also been making wooden<br />\ncutouts of waves and sea creatures such as octopi and jellyfish. The<br />\ngroup has been trying to obtain tires to use as the hump of a giant<br />\nsea monster, and to get nautical flags from the United States Coast<br />\nGuard.<br />\nTang said, \"The Theme Committee must be really dedicated, or<br />\nSpring Fair wouldn't be a cohesive whole.\" He said that the many<br />\nworked with other committees to incorporate many different aspects<br />\nof Fair into the theme, so that by Friday everything would \"fit in.,,<br />\nAll the other committees, he pointed out, can sometimes lose sight<br />\nof the theme in the day-to-day \"hustle and bustle\" of arranging events,<br />\nso the theme committees must make sure that the central theme is<br />\nfully represented in the Fair.<br />\n<br />\n\f10/APRIL 14, 1989<br />\n<br />\nSpecial Events<br />\nwants you to<br />\nFind the Anchor<br />\nby Gregory W.

Domino's will sell pizza, and crabs will<br />\n<br />\nbe available for the first time ever.<br />\nThe food booths will be spread over the<br />\nLower Quad and the Upper Quad. However,<br />\non Monday, arrangements had to be made to<br />\nmove six booths.<br />\nAccording to Janss, the Department of<br />\nPsychology is conducting experiments with<br />\nrats in the basement of Ames Hall.

White Athletic Center Saturday morning. The race,<br />\nwith separate men's, women's, and Hopkins divisions will wind<br />\naround the Homewood campus finishing on the track.<br />\nA relatively new activity for Spring Fair, the race will attract approximately 225 runners, according to Skip Bacon, race committee<br />\nchair. The course begins in front of the Athletic Center, proceeds<br />\nalong University Parkway and then down Charles Street to Wyman<br />\nPark. The course then works its way around the back of campus and<br />\nfinishes at the track.<br />\nBacon describes the race as a \"fun run on the middle ground\" between a 5K and 10K race. The committee thought that an 8K race<br />\nwould be challenging, but not too long. The race was originally intended to promote health, not competition, but that has not deterred<br />\nserious competitors from entering the event.<br />\nLast year's male winner was Anthony Grier, who won with a time<br />\nof 26:00. The female winner was Pat Milleson, with a time of 30:19.<br />\n<br />\nSandy Saluzary won the Hopkins division with a time of 33.05. This<br />\nyear Bacon predicts the competition to be as good as last year's, if<br />\nnot better.<br />\nPlanning for the race began at the start of the semester with a search<br />\nfor sponsors. Bacon explained his method for finding sponsors: \"You<br />\nbasically ask them (sponsors] how much they will give,\" he said.<br />\nThe sponsors put up $2,000 to pay for the race.<br />\nThis year's sponsors include Schaefer beer, Domino's Pizza, and<br />\nReebok shoes. Bacon said that all of the proceeds from the race go<br />\nto benefit the homeless of Baltimore.<br />\nAfter finding sponsors, Bacon and his committee had to plan the<br />\ncourse and seek city approval. \"We've been working on things one<br />\nat a time,\" he said. Since receiving permission from the city, the committee has been busily promoting the race and signing up participants.<br />\nAnyone may register for the race on Friday at the Spring Fair office or just before the race on Saturday morning. Registration is $9<br />\non Friday and $10 Saturday. Bacon said that anyone who would like<br />\nto help officiate should speak with him before the race.

Kenneth Duberstein, former<br />\nchief of staff in the Reagan administration, will<br />\naddress seniors in the afternoon of May 25.<br />\nWhile Duberstein is a relative unknown to<br />\nmany, he will doubtless send seniors out into<br />\nthe world with a rousing and challenging<br />\naddress.<br />\nMore interesting, perhaps, than the speaker<br />\nhimself, has been the drama that has unfolded<br />\nin his selection. From late starts to lack of student participation to severe budget limitations,<br />\nthe selection process has been plagued from the<br />\nvery beginning. That we have snatched a<br />\nspeaker from the jaws of defeat at all is tantamount to a miracle.<br />\nWe should not, however, bog ourselves down<br />\nin the mire of rehashing the endless details of<br />\nthis somewhat sad situation. Rather, we should<br />\nglean what lessons we can from the difficulties<br />\nthat they have faced over the course of the year.<br />\nFirst, the senior class, if they are to attract a<br />\nspeaker of reasonable caliber, ought to have<br />\nsufficient funding to support their expectations.<br />\nAt present, there is $2500 budgeted for this purpose; on the lecture circuit more sought-after<br />\nspeakers can fetch up to ten times as much.<br />\nFor those universities that do not allot large<br />\namounts of r9ch to comr\u2014ncement speakers,<br />\n<br />\nthere is often compensation in the form of an<br />\nhonorary degree for the speaker. At present,<br />\nthe University has \"strict policies\" regarding<br />\nthe granting of such degrees.<br />\nThe offer of an honorary degree might<br />\nsweeten the pot for anyone considering speaking here; however, for this to occur, the<br />\nTrustees must be given advance notice and<br />\ndeem the potential recipient as worthy of the<br />\nhonor.<br />\nWhich brings us to our final point:<br />\npossibilities for speakers must be compiled<br />\nearlier in the year than has been the practice<br />\nin years past. This year, despite the endless<br />\ndisclaimers from senior class officers, there was<br />\na serious dearth of publicity surrounding the<br />\nproject. Senior Week, ostensibly the most important responsiblity of the senior class officers,<br />\nought to be in full gear by the middle of the<br />\nfirst semester, soliciting opinions and compiling early lists in order to facilitate selection.<br />\nThese options ought to be fully communicated<br />\nto the class throughout the year. We need only<br />\nlook to the experiences of this year's class for<br />\nfailures in this sort of rapport. It seemed seniors<br />\nheard little of any plan until it was a fait accompli; this individualistic style of leadership<br />\ncreated a sense of futility and further discouraged senior class involvement.<br />\n<br />\nSecuring a position<br />\nThe appointment of Lou Giangiulio to the<br />\nsearch committee for a new Hopkins president<br />\nis an unexpected boon. After all, student contact with the Board of Trustees has been limited<br />\nto the occasional protest outside of Board<br />\nmeetings. The Trustees have preferred to<br />\nreceive their student viewpoint from the Young<br />\nTrustees, whose positions they created to meet<br />\nthis specific need.<br />\nEvents of the last year, however, have<br />\ndemonstrated that undergraduates desire more<br />\ninput into decisions that will affect them. The<br />\nFebruary brouhaha over the Five-Year Plan was<br />\ndue not<br />\nmuch to objections over the plan<br />\n<br />\nitself, but rather to students' lack of involvement in its drafting and fears of being left out<br />\nof its implementation.<br />\nBut it is noteworthy that the addition of a student to the committee is due to exhaustive efforts on the part of Giangiulio. Were it not for<br />\nhis initiative, this in all probability would never<br />\nhave occurred. We commend Giangiulio for his<br />\nenergy and note the precedent that his appointment to the committee sets in terms of administrative sensitivity to student concerns. We<br />\ncan only hope that it bodes well for further student involvement in the future.<br />\n<br />\nby James Rosen<br />\n<br />\nDue to incredible incompetence last week, we mislaid Rosen 's cartoon strip and were forced to reprint<br />\none of \"Rosen 's best.\" It was all our fault, and to make up for it, this week we're running both last<br />\nweek's and this week's strip.

To the<br />\npeople on the east side of campus,<br />\nthese stores are closer than the<br />\nones in Hamden.<br />\nThere are a number of students<br />\nwho are concerned about the safety of the Greenmount area. Jared<br />\nBrennan says that although he<br />\ndoes eat fast food on occassion,<br />\nhe would not be likely to go to<br />\nGreenmount, and certainly not as<br />\nfar south as 28th street, to get it.<br />\n\"I didn't know there were any<br />\nfast food restaurants over there.<br />\nNow that I know, I'd say I don't<br />\nlike the neighborhood.\"<br />\nEric Hymowitz, a student who<br />\ndrives the security van, says he<br />\nhas no reservations about going<br />\nover to Greenmount to pick up a<br />\nquick bite, and he even does so<br />\non occassion.

At this<br />\npoint Tennison, the winner of last<br />\n<br />\nyear's Showcase, entertained the<br />\naudience with original music that<br />\nhe played on synthesizers. His<br />\nequipment played most of the first<br />\ntwo pieces (\"Funk You\" and<br />\n\"Fanfare for the Ordinary<br />\nDude\") and he played the final<br />\npiece, \"Dissonance Boogie\"<br />\nlive, his keyboard sounding like<br />\na digitally-sampled piano.<br />\nThe judges returned at the end<br />\nof the piece, and announced that<br />\nLou Giangiulio was the winner in<br />\nthe \"miscellaneous\" category; in<br />\n\"classical,\" Michele Pineda; in<br />\n\"pop,\" Lovejoy and his Nuclear<br />\nBand. The JHU Gospel Choir<br />\nwas the overall winner of the<br />\nShowcase.<br />\n\"There was a lot of good<br />\ntalent,\" said Choir member Pat<br />\nBrown, \"so we were surprised<br />\nand moved when we won.

John Tennison<br />\nsaid he knew nothing of his victory last year. \"Either I won<br />\nsomething and I didn't know<br />\nabout it or I didn't really win<br />\nanything. I'm not sure,\" he said.<br />\nTennison declined to compete<br />\n<br />\n-..---....-----\".-.-<br />\n<br />\nThe oft-used piano is a symbol of the many offerings of the Musical Showcase.<br />\nin this year's showcase to avoid<br />\nhauling the many digital instruments he would need. Instead, he volunteered to join the<br />\nCommittee and to play during the<br />\njudging of the contest. He was offered the chance to head the<br />\nShowcase Committee, but turned<br />\ndown the opportunity.<br />\n\"I've been on that committee<br />\nsince freshman year,\" he said. \"I<br />\ndid this 'Funk You' thing and I<br />\nwas chaired out. I had my fill of<br />\n<br />\nadministration and I wanted to<br />\nwork on my compositions.\"<br />\nTennison said that this year's<br />\nShowcase was very similar to that<br />\nheld in 1988. He pointed out that<br />\nthe \"miscellaneous\" category<br />\nwas new, that Erika Horsey last<br />\nyear played the piano rather than<br />\nguitar, and that nothing on stage<br />\nlast year was as large as the<br />\nGospel Choir.<br />\nThe Musical Showcase was<br />\nfounded five years ago by Paul<br />\n<br />\nBrunetta, a former Housemaster<br />\nwho is now in medical school.<br />\nSays Director of Residential Life<br />\nAndrea Perry,\"He knew a lot of<br />\npeople who had a whole lot of<br />\ntalent that should get annual<br />\nshowing.\"<br />\n\"We're looking for more performers, especially freshmen,\"<br />\nPerry said.\"We want more people next year.\"<br />\n<br />\nYOU GOTTA BE THERE!<br />\nCollege Night at Memorial Stadium<br />\nWednesday, May 3<br />\nOrioles vs. California Angels<br />\n7:35 p.m.<br />\nGame Time<br />\nAmmir<br />\n<br />\nTickets on sale in the Student<br />\nActivities Office through April 26<br />\n$2.00<br />\n<br />\nSponsored by the ICPB<br />\n<br />\n\f20/APRIL 14, 1989'<br />\n<br />\nACROSS<br />\n<br />\n=MEM M<br />\nUMMIIMM<br />\nauu UNIMMMNM<br />\nMM. =MM. \u2022MM.<br />\nMMIIMM<br />\nMMEMINIM<br />\nMIIMM<br />\nMM.= MMINIMMU<br />\nNM<br />\nIMMMM NM'<br />\nNMI= MEM.=<br />\nNEM MOM<br />\n8<br />\n<br />\n9<br />\n<br />\n10<br />\n<br />\n6<br />\n<br />\nMu<br />\n<br />\nMINIM<br />\n<br />\nMM.=<br />\n<br />\nMIIMM<br />\n<br />\nMaulMUM=<br />\nWIMM<br />\n<br />\nNM<br />\n<br />\n1 Restricted<br />\n6 Tossed<br />\n11 Automobile's<br />\nhome<br />\n12 Lodger<br />\n14 Paradise<br />\n15 Separate<br />\n17 Diphthong<br />\n18 Cloth measure<br />\n19 Once more<br />\n20 Piece out<br />\n21 Compass point<br />\n22 Gymnastic feat<br />\n23 Winter vehicle<br />\n24 Landed<br />\nproperties<br />\n26 Bridges<br />\n27 Word of sorrow<br />\n28 Close<br />\n29 Bread maker<br />\n31 Leanest<br />\n<br />\nI<br />\n<br />\nMUMMa=<br />\n<br />\n34 Poems<br />\n35 Brief<br />\n36 Chaldean city<br />\n37 Paid notices<br />\n38 Evade an<br />\nobligation<br />\n<br />\n39 Baker's product<br />\n40 Compass point<br />\n41 Shift<br />\n42 Temporary beds<br />\n43 Marine snail<br />\n45 Runs away to be<br />\nmarried<br />\n47 Narrow, flat<br />\nboards<br />\n48 Portions of<br />\nmedicine<br />\n<br />\nDOWN<br />\n1 Dippers<br />\n2 City in Russia<br />\n3 Container<br />\n4 Symbol fo silver<br />\n5 Alliances<br />\n6 Characteristic<br />\n7 Musical<br />\ninstrument<br />\n8 Decay<br />\n9 Printer's<br />\nmeasure<br />\n10 Enfeeble<br />\n11 Web-footed<br />\nbirds<br />\n<br />\n13 Loom devices<br />\n16 Shallow vessels<br />\n19 Essence<br />\n20 Raise the<br />\nspirit of<br />\n22 Transactions<br />\n23 Gush out<br />\n25 Seizes<br />\n26 Voracious fish<br />\n28 Frolicked<br />\n29 Brag<br />\n30 Snakes<br />\n31 Part of leg<br />\n32 Retinues<br />\n33 Lock of hair<br />\n35 Keeps clear of<br />\n38 Discharged a<br />\ngun<br />\n39 Head of<br />\nCa'holic<br />\nChurch<br />\n41 Music: as<br />\nwritten<br />\n42 Race of lettuce<br />\n44 Negative prefix<br />\n46 Behold!<br />\n<br />\nCOLLEGE PRESS SERVICE<br />\n<br />\nActivities Calendar<br />\nFRIDAY, APRIL 14<br />\n<br />\nSUNDAY, APRIL 16<br />\n<br />\nTHURSDAY, APRIL 20<br />\n<br />\n12-6 p.m. SPRING FAIR\u2014MARITIME '89.<br />\n4-6 p.m HOPPY HOUR\u2014Decker Garden.<br />\nAndrew Moffit performs.<br />\n7 p.m. Barnstormers present the Tony Awardwinning The Mystery of Edwin Drood\u2014<br />\nArellano Theater. $4 students, $6 general.<br />\nAudience chooses from over 500 endings!<br />\n8 p.m. Comedian Steven Wright performs\u2014<br />\nShriver Hall.

(Exception: tenor player<br />\nBilly Pierce on \"Pee Wee.\") As<br />\n<br />\nif to compensate, Williams and<br />\nco-producer and engineer Jason<br />\nCorsaro mixed Angel Street like<br />\na rock album. Corsaro's work as<br />\na rock engineer shines through:<br />\nthe overall sound is flashy, but<br />\nnot tacky, and three brief drumonly tracks give the album a sense<br />\nof levity.

Greg Bronshvag must be thanked for the<br />\ntime he spent conducting these interviews and writing these<br />\narticles.<br />\n<br />\nCraig Weinstein will graduate<br />\nin May with a B.A. in Economics<br />\nafter lettering four times in soccer. He made the All-MAC team<br />\nthe past three years (first-team<br />\ntwice, honorable-mention once)<br />\nand was nominated for Division<br />\nIII All-American in 1986. In the<br />\nHopkins record books, he ranks<br />\nfirst in career assists, fourth in<br />\ncareer goals, and first in overall<br />\npoints scored.<br />\n\"Over the yea's, the style of<br />\nplay (at Hopkins) has changed a<br />\nlot, going from a kick-and-run<br />\nteam to a more ball-control,<br />\nEuropean-style team. We've done<br />\nno better than we should have.<br />\nWe never beat a team that we<br />\nshouldn't have beaten. Something<br />\nwas lacking.<br />\n\"When we went to the NCAAs<br />\nin 1986, we played very well<br />\ntogether. When the coach<br />\n(Tierney) quit for another job<br />\nafterwards, the soccer program<br />\ncould've gone one of two ways:<br />\nBecome even better by pushing<br />\nsoccer and hiring a full-time,<br />\nqualified soccer coach\u2014like football, basketball, fencing, wrestling, baseball, and lacrosse<br />\nteams\u2014or stay the same by hiring a part-time coach with no time<br />\nfor recruiting and building a team<br />\nin the off-season.<br />\n\"The coaching situation is one<br />\nthat not too many people in the<br />\nsoccer program are happy with,<br />\nexcept possibly for Mr. Scott,<br />\nwho designed it so that an assistant lacrosse coach also takes the<br />\nresponsibility of head soccer<br />\ncoach. Coach Haus has come a<br />\nlong way. He was put in an extremely tough situation, because<br />\nhe's never played soccer before.<br />\nIf someone offered me the headsoccer-coach job at Duke or some<br />\nother great program and told me<br />\nI would also have to coach<br />\nlacrosse, I'd take it. But that<br />\nwouldn't be fair to the lacrosse<br />\nplayers.<br />\n\"Mr. Scott supports us and<br />\nwants us to win, but he doesn't<br />\nwant us to win as much as we did.<br />\nWhen you've got players putting<br />\nin at least thirty hours a week<br />\nthink he needs to be even more<br />\nsupportive. To him, winning<br />\neight games is a good season. It's<br />\nfrustrating when everyone on the<br />\nteam wants to win more than the<br />\nA.D. wants you to.<br />\n\"I'd say that we were one of<br />\nthe best teams in Division III soccer the past two years. There<br />\nwans't one team that we couldn't<br />\nhave beaten. Still, we kept playing the same level of competition<br />\n<br />\nyear after year instead of scheduling better teams.<br />\n\"I've given a bleak outlook of<br />\nthe program, but there's a<br />\ntradeoff. If the school pushed soccer, like lacrosse, then it wouldn't<br />\nbe as much fun. It wouldn't feel<br />\nlike our team. The soccer team is<br />\nours. The only pressure to win<br />\ncame from the players<br />\nthemselves. It's just great to play.<br />\nI hope that, in the future, the program will continue to improve.<br />\n\"The truth of the matter is that<br />\nthings aren't equal. The basketball team gets new shoes every<br />\nyear, and the baseball team gets<br />\nnew uniforms and dugouts. When<br />\nyou see that, and know that<br />\neveryone else on the team sees it,<br />\nyou get upset. A really nice grass<br />\nfield would be great instead of the<br />\nlower field. You can tell that the<br />\nmoney and attention isn't being<br />\nput into soccer, which is<br />\nfrustrating.\"<br />\nHowever, when Weinstein<br />\nlooks back on it all, the positives<br />\ncome to mind first.<br />\n\"Making the NCAAs will<br />\nalways be a highlight. Also, pulling together in some close games,<br />\nand a certain goal or two. Mainly, just winning and having a<br />\ngreat time with my friends.\"<br />\nWeinstein has excelled off the<br />\nfield as well. He is a member of<br />\na fraternity, has helped inner-city<br />\nkids in the Hopkins Tutorial Program, and has been on the Dean's<br />\nList the past two years.<br />\n\"Hopkins is as good as a<br />\nschool can be academically. It<br />\nputs a lot of emphasis on<br />\nyourself, which forces you to<br />\nmotivate yourself. It's been a<br />\ngreat time for me.\"<br />\n<br />\nBrian Dulin will graduate in<br />\nMay with a B.S. in Electrical<br />\nEngineering after lettering four<br />\ntimes in football. He finished his<br />\ncareer at running back with 1,813<br />\ncareer yards, placing him third on<br />\nthe Hopkins All-Time Leading<br />\nRushers' list. He was honored in<br />\n1986 as the football team's<br />\noutstanding sophomore, and this<br />\npast year as the outstanding senior<br />\ncontributor.<br />\n\"A lot of people would say that<br />\nthe football program has gone<br />\nfrom good to bad, but that's not<br />\ntrue. It's improved as the adminstration has paid more attention to it by letting Coach Pfeifer<br />\nbring in more players. However,<br />\nhe brings in quantity, not quality. He should bring players in<br />\nfrom high schools with a tradition<br />\nof winning.\"<br />\nDulin went to Father Judge<br />\nHigh School, whose football team<br />\nwon the tough Philadelphia<br />\nCatholic League three of his four<br />\nyears.<br />\n\"I know what it's like to win,<br />\nbut sometimes I think that only<br />\nhalf of our team knows that feeling. My freshman year, we had<br />\n<br />\na winning record, and I expected<br />\nthe team to get better with every<br />\nyear. After that season, there<br />\nseemed to be a transition in<br />\nleadership at the QB position,<br />\nwhich is so vital to the offense.<br />\nNo one could step in and be a<br />\nleader. Part of the problem was<br />\nthat coach Pfeifer, who always<br />\nprepares well for a game, would<br />\nabandon somettimg if it didn't<br />\nwork immediately, which usually resulted in a player being yanked. That takes away your<br />\nconfidence.<br />\n\"On any level\u2014high school,<br />\ncollege, or pro\u2014if you go 1-9,<br />\nthe first place everyone looks is<br />\nat the head coach, whether or not<br />\nit's his fault. The coaching.staff<br />\n(at Hopkins) should be switched<br />\nthat Coach Pfeifer, who always<br />\nfensive coordinator, but as a head<br />\ncoach, he is not a great motivator.<br />\nHe gets a bum rap, even though<br />\noff the field he's a super person.<br />\nBut it takes more to be a great<br />\ncoach than that. You have to<br />\nrelate to the players and not allow<br />\nthem to get down on themselves.<br />\n\"But there's more to all this.<br />\nOverall, the team needs to be<br />\nmore serious. For instance, not<br />\neveryone works out when they're<br />\nsupposed to. It's not good for the<br />\nfreshmen to have suffered<br />\nthrough a season like this past<br />\none. A lot of talking needs to be<br />\ndone between the coaches and<br />\nplayes. Also, the team needs to be<br />\nput on a strict weightlifting<br />\nschedule, which everyone should<br />\nfollow.<br />\n\"Next year's team already has<br />\nthe best talent in the [Centennial]<br />\nleague, but it will all depend on<br />\nthe players deciding for<br />\nthemselves to change their attitude, start working hard, and<br />\nfollow the coaches instead of being against them. This team can<br />\ngo far in a very competitive<br />\nleague. The possibility of<br />\nHopkins getting an NCAA bid<br />\nexists. The team can only go in<br />\none direction, and that's up.<br />\nPositive things can happen, but<br />\nthe way things are right now, the<br />\nfirst game of the season is going<br />\nto make or break the team next<br />\nyear.\"<br />\nDulin could have gone to<br />\nCarnegie-Mellon, Gettysburg,<br />\nWagner, Widener, or an Ivy<br />\nLeague school to play football.<br />\nYet he chose Hopkins.<br />\n\"I wanted to go to a place<br />\nwhere, even if I got hurt playing<br />\nfootball, I wouldn't have to worry<br />\nbecause academics would have<br />\nbeen there all along. I knew I<br />\nwasn't going to the pros, but I<br />\nstill wanted to play. At an Ivy<br />\nschool, I wouldn've been sitting<br />\nfor two or three years before I got<br />\na chance. I'm not willing to sit on<br />\nthe bench and say I'm part of a<br />\nteam. Academics and playing<br />\nfootball were both possible at<br />\nHopkins.<br />\n\"The academics are tough<br />\nhere, and the school could do a<br />\nlot more for its students. I taught<br />\nmyself half of my courses<br />\nbecause certain professors cared<br />\nmore about their research than<br />\ntheir teaching. Still, Hopkins has<br />\nbeen a good experience for me.<br />\nI don't think I wouldn've made it<br />\nhere without my friends I'll<br />\nalways remember my friends first<br />\nand football second.\"<br />\nSee DULIN, 31<br />\n<br />\n3120<br />\n<br />\nSt.<br />\n<br />\n235-4413<br />\nTAILORING, REPAIRING SAME DAY CLEANING AND PRESSING, SHOE REPAIRING<br />\n<br />\nr<br />\nI<br />\n<br />\nBringi n this coupon with your incoming order for a --I1<br />\n<br />\n110%<br />\ndiscount on all dry cleaning'1<br />\n1<br />\nexpires 4/20/89<br />\n1<br />\n1<br />\nI\u2014<br />\n-J<br />\n<br />\nCOLLEGE MALES:4-HOW QUICKLY CAN YOU REACT?<br />\nSHOW US TO EARN $300<br />\nWork 4 DAYS in a research ,setting at<br />\nJohns Hopkins School of Medicine.

The win was the fourteenth consecutive in the regular season for<br />\nthe Blue Jays and the fourth straight over<br />\nthe Tar Heels.<br />\nHopkins, which is now 6-0 and ranked<br />\nnumber one in both the USILA and Sun<br />\npolls, jumped out to a 1-0 lead just 1:06<br />\ninto the game when senior midfielder<br />\nBrendan Kelly scored off an assist from<br />\nJeff Ihm. The Tar Heels answered right<br />\nback, however, scoring three unanswered<br />\ngoals, including two by attackman Neill<br />\nRedfern.<br />\nThe two teams began trading goals for<br />\nthe rest of the first half, as Hopkins failed<br />\nto control the tempo and run their ball-<br /><br />\ncontrol offense. After goals by Johns<br />\nWilkens and Matt Panetta had tied the<br />\ngame for Hopkins at the close of the first<br />\nquarter, Dennis Goldstein put the Tar<br />\nHeels back on top 4-3 by scoring on a fast<br />\nbreak just ten seconds into the second<br />\nquarter. Wilkens once again evened the<br />\nscore 2:54 into the quarter, and after each<br />\nteam tallied to make it 5-5, neither Hopkins<br />\nnor Carolina scored for the final 8:20 of<br />\nthe first half.<br />\n\"We did not execute well at all in the<br />\nfirst half of the ball game,\" commented<br />\nHopkins Coach Don Zimmerman. \"We<br />\nweren't doing things the way we should be<br />\ndoing them.

Fortsch<br />\nA native of Louisville, KY,<br />\nSagar<br />\nLonial<br />\nis<br />\na<br />\nbiology/philosophy major who<br />\nwill graduate in June and attend<br />\nmedical school in the fall. In addition to these accomplishments,<br />\nLonial has another unique distinction of which to be proud. He has<br />\nbeen chosen as Young Trustee for<br />\nthe Class of 1989.<br />\nThe process began in March<br />\nwhen sophomores, juniors, and<br />\nseniors voted for the Young<br />\nTrustee, choosing five of twelve<br />\ncandidates on the ballot. Before<br />\nvoting, each Young Trustee candidate was required to submit an<br />\napplication entailing any relevant<br />\nbiographical information, his<br />\nfield of study, interests, and extracurricular activities, both at<br />\nHopkins and elsewhere.<br />\nAfter two sets of balloting, the<br />\nfive remaining trustee candidates<br />\nwent to the Nominating Committee of the Board of trustees,<br /><br />\nwhich interviewed each of the<br />\nfive finalists.<br />\nFollowing the interviewing<br />\nprocess, the Nominating Committee voted on which candidate<br />\nbest suited the position of Young<br />\nTrustee, and submitted their<br />\nrecommendation to the Board of<br />\nTrustees. Lonial was their choice.<br />\nThe Trustees approved the<br />\nnomination Monday.<br />\nA housemaster for two years as<br />\nwell as an admissions intern and<br />\nmember of the Blue Key Society, Lonial explained, \"This is an<br />\nimportant time in the University's<br />\nfuture, with the new president<br />\nand the Five-Year Plan. I am excited to be a part of what will<br />\nultimately be the future of<br />\nHopkins.\"<br />\nLonial decided to run for<br />\nYoung Trustee because \"I've enjoyed working with different people in many areas and I wanted<br />\nto continue. I will now be active<br />\nin a new and interesting way.\"<br /><br />\nJohn Misa<br /><br />\nDole, said FitzGerald, seemed<br />\nto be \"waiting for Harvard or<br />\nYale,\" to request him as a<br />\nspeaker, and therefore would not<br />\nmake a definite commitment to<br />\nHopkins either way.<br />\nThe selection committee also<br />\nhad other problems. It posted<br />\nadvertisements for its meetings,<br />\nbut these meetings attracted \"two<br />\nor three people, though these people worked really hard,\" according to Klupt.

The Upper and Lower<br />\nQuads will be filled with arts and<br />\ncrafts booths for all three days of<br />\nthe fair.<br />\nAt this year's Fair, about thirty more arts and crafts vendors<br />\nwill be here, compared to last<br />\nyear's Fair. \"About half of the<br />\nvendors are here for the first<br />\ntime,\" said Mirsky. She said that<br />\nthe vendors' offerings at this<br />\nyear's Fair are more diverse than<br />\nthose last year. Some of the new<br />\nvendors will sell inlaid wood<br />\ncrafts, stained glass, wind<br />\nchimes, handmade flutes, and<br />\nhandpainted Ukrainian Easter<br />\neggs.<br />\nMirsky said, \"Even in the<br />\nmore common arts and crafts,<br />\nsuch as jewelry. . .there will be<br />\ndiverse types of media used to<br />\nmake these crafts.\" Some examples of these diverse media are<br />\njewelry made out of electronic<br />\ncircuits, paper, brass, ivory, and<br />\nthe traditional precious metals.<br />\nShe also said that the quality of<br />\nthe arts and crafts offered at Fair<br />\nwill be exceptionally high. Referring to last year's vendors, Mirsky said, \"If their stuff wasn't up<br />\nto the same quality level or was<br />\nmanufactured, then they were not<br />\nasked back.\" She added, \"We<br />\nhave very high quality stuff this<br />\nyear.\"<br />\nMansfield and Mirsky scouted<br />\nnew talent for Fair at a large arts<br />\nand crafts fair that took place this<br />\nspring at the Inner Harbor. The<br />\nvendors this year are from as far<br />\naway as Tennessee and Vermont,<br /><br />\nalthough many are from the local<br />\ncommunity. Commenting on the<br />\nease with which the arts and<br />\ncrafts committee attracted talent<br />\nthis year, Mirsky said, \"This Fair<br />\nhas a very good reputation.\"<br />\nAsked how this year's<br />\nMaritime '89 theme fits in with<br />\narts and crafts, Mirsky said the<br />\ntheme was especially popular<br />\nwith local vendors because<br />\n\". . .the harbor is the center of<br />\nlife in Baltimore.\" Many of the<br />\ncrafts offered this year will be<br />\ncentered on the maritime theme.<br />\nSome of these offerings include<br />\ndriftwood sculptures, seashell<br />\ncrafts, maritime theme silk<br />\nscreening, harbor prints, and fish<br />\nearrings. According to Mirsky,<br />\nthe vendors are going out of their<br />\nway to incorporate this year's<br />\ntheme into their crafts displays.<br />\nThis year's Fair also offers a<br />\nnumber of crafts booths for<br />\nchildren. One of the most notable<br />\nof these is a vendor who makes<br />\nmask kits for children called<br />\n\"Curiosity Kits.\" Each kit is based on a real type of mask and<br />\ncomes with an explanation of the<br />\nhistory behind the mask. These<br />\nkits are handmade especially for<br />\nchildren as educational toys.<br />\nSeveral other booths that<br />\nshould be interesting for children<br />\nare the handcarved Chinese<br />\ncheckers board booth, the wood<br />\ntoys booth, and the handprint tshirt booths.<br />\nTwo of the more exotic attractions will be a Tarot card reader<br />\nand a glass blower. The glass<br />\nblower will demonstrate from<br />\nstart to finish the ancient technique of glass blowing. His booth<br />\nwill be between Barton and<br />\nLatrobe Hall<br />\nMirsky sati this year's arts and<br /><br />\ncrafts section will be attractive to<br />\ncollege students. \"For the college<br />\ncommunity. . . we try to have<br />\nstuff they can afford,\" she said,<br />\nadding that the new booth run by<br />\nthe Fraternity Row store would<br />\noffer wares that will be popular<br />\namong students. Mirsky said of<br />\nHopkins students, \"I don't think<br />\nthey will be disappointed.\"<br />\nShe also said that many ,\u2022endors' applications for space were<br />\nturned down because the merchandise prices were deemed too<br />\nhigh for the Fair crowd. Mirsky<br />\nsaid, however,\"We really try to<br />\nhave something for everyone.\"<br />\nPast arts and crafts vendors<br />\nhave complained of theft problems.

This year's theme is<br />\nnautical, hence the theme of Spring Fair is \"Maritime '89.\"<br />\nThe group's fifteen members have been meeting regularly since the<br />\nbeginning of January. As often happens, the group dismissed some<br />\nof its initial ideas as \"farfetched,\" such as turning Gilman Hall into<br />\na lighthouse.<br />\nThe committee decided to divide the campus into several areas: the<br />\narea in front of the Milton S. Eisenhower Library would appropriately<br />\nbe called the \"Beach,\" complete with artificial surf; especially for<br />\nkids area would become the \"Pirates' Cove,\" with ambling buccaneers; the Upper Quad would be the \"Upper Harbor,\" with sails<br />\nand nautical flags; and the Lower Quad would turn into \"Ten Thousand Leagues Beneath the Sea,\" complete with underwater creatures.<br />\nSince the traditional releasing of balloons is considered too much<br />\nof an environmental hazard, Fair chairs will instead dedicate the ship<br />\nS.S. Hopkins to begin the Fair. Tony Pagnotti, a reporter for WMARTV, will have the honors. As part of nighttime entertainment, the<br />\nGlass Pavilion will be turned into a \"fishbowl,\" and the Great Hall<br />\nwill be considered the deck of a ship.<br />\nMost of the committee's work in the last few weeks has involved<br />\ndecorating the campus. It has been busy designing the banners with<br />\nthe different area designations, and has also been making wooden<br />\ncutouts of waves and sea creatures such as octopi and jellyfish. The<br />\ngroup has been trying to obtain tires to use as the hump of a giant<br />\nsea monster, and to get nautical flags from the United States Coast<br />\nGuard.<br />\nTang said, \"The Theme Committee must be really dedicated, or<br />\nSpring Fair wouldn't be a cohesive whole.\" He said that the many<br />\nworked with other committees to incorporate many different aspects<br />\nof Fair into the theme, so that by Friday everything would \"fit in.,,<br />\nAll the other committees, he pointed out, can sometimes lose sight<br />\nof the theme in the day-to-day \"hustle and bustle\" of arranging events,<br />\nso the theme committees must make sure that the central theme is<br />\nfully represented in the Fair.<br /><br />\n10/APRIL 14, 1989<br /><br />\nSpecial Events<br />\nwants you to<br />\nFind the Anchor<br />\nby Gregory W.

The race,<br />\nwith separate men's, women's, and Hopkins divisions will wind<br />\naround the Homewood campus finishing on the track.<br />\nA relatively new activity for Spring Fair, the race will attract approximately 225 runners, according to Skip Bacon, race committee<br />\nchair. The course begins in front of the Athletic Center, proceeds<br />\nalong University Parkway and then down Charles Street to Wyman<br />\nPark. The course then works its way around the back of campus and<br />\nfinishes at the track.<br />\nBacon describes the race as a \"fun run on the middle ground\" between a 5K and 10K race. The committee thought that an 8K race<br />\nwould be challenging, but not too long. The race was originally intended to promote health, not competition, but that has not deterred<br />\nserious competitors from entering the event.<br />\nLast year's male winner was Anthony Grier, who won with a time<br />\nof 26:00. The female winner was Pat Milleson, with a time of 30:19.<br /><br />\nSandy Saluzary won the Hopkins division with a time of 33.05. This<br />\nyear Bacon predicts the competition to be as good as last year's, if<br />\nnot better.<br />\nPlanning for the race began at the start of the semester with a search<br />\nfor sponsors. Bacon explained his method for finding sponsors: \"You<br />\nbasically ask them (sponsors] how much they will give,\" he said.<br />\nThe sponsors put up $2,000 to pay for the race.<br />\nThis year's sponsors include Schaefer beer, Domino's Pizza, and<br />\nReebok shoes. Bacon said that all of the proceeds from the race go<br />\nto benefit the homeless of Baltimore.<br />\nAfter finding sponsors, Bacon and his committee had to plan the<br />\ncourse and seek city approval. \"We've been working on things one<br />\nat a time,\" he said. Since receiving permission from the city, the committee has been busily promoting the race and signing up participants.<br />\nAnyone may register for the race on Friday at the Spring Fair office or just before the race on Saturday morning. Registration is $9<br />\non Friday and $10 Saturday. Bacon said that anyone who would like<br />\nto help officiate should speak with him before the race. Everyone who<br />\nworks will receive a free race t-shirt.<br /><br />\nPrimer<br />\nfor new<br />\nSpring<br />\nFairgoers<br />\nFor freshmen and other persons who are unfamiliar with<br />\nsome of the changes in basic campus services that result from<br />\nSpring Fair, here is a primer.<br />\n*Spring Fair will be held today<br />\nfrom noon to 6 p.m., Saturday<br />\nfrom 10 a.m. to 6 p.m., and Sunday from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. Admission is free.

Kenneth Duberstein, former<br />\nchief of staff in the Reagan administration, will<br />\naddress seniors in the afternoon of May 25.<br />\nWhile Duberstein is a relative unknown to<br />\nmany, he will doubtless send seniors out into<br />\nthe world with a rousing and challenging<br />\naddress.<br />\nMore interesting, perhaps, than the speaker<br />\nhimself, has been the drama that has unfolded<br />\nin his selection. From late starts to lack of student participation to severe budget limitations,<br />\nthe selection process has been plagued from the<br />\nvery beginning. That we have snatched a<br />\nspeaker from the jaws of defeat at all is tantamount to a miracle.<br />\nWe should not, however, bog ourselves down<br />\nin the mire of rehashing the endless details of<br />\nthis somewhat sad situation. Rather, we should<br />\nglean what lessons we can from the difficulties<br />\nthat they have faced over the course of the year.<br />\nFirst, the senior class, if they are to attract a<br />\nspeaker of reasonable caliber, ought to have<br />\nsufficient funding to support their expectations.<br />\nAt present, there is $2500 budgeted for this purpose; on the lecture circuit more sought-after<br />\nspeakers can fetch up to ten times as much.<br />\nFor those universities that do not allot large<br />\namounts of r9ch to comr\u2014ncement speakers,<br /><br />\nthere is often compensation in the form of an<br />\nhonorary degree for the speaker. At present,<br />\nthe University has \"strict policies\" regarding<br />\nthe granting of such degrees.<br />\nThe offer of an honorary degree might<br />\nsweeten the pot for anyone considering speaking here; however, for this to occur, the<br />\nTrustees must be given advance notice and<br />\ndeem the potential recipient as worthy of the<br />\nhonor.<br />\nWhich brings us to our final point:<br />\npossibilities for speakers must be compiled<br />\nearlier in the year than has been the practice<br />\nin years past. This year, despite the endless<br />\ndisclaimers from senior class officers, there was<br />\na serious dearth of publicity surrounding the<br />\nproject. Senior Week, ostensibly the most important responsiblity of the senior class officers,<br />\nought to be in full gear by the middle of the<br />\nfirst semester, soliciting opinions and compiling early lists in order to facilitate selection.<br />\nThese options ought to be fully communicated<br />\nto the class throughout the year. We need only<br />\nlook to the experiences of this year's class for<br />\nfailures in this sort of rapport. It seemed seniors<br />\nheard little of any plan until it was a fait accompli; this individualistic style of leadership<br />\ncreated a sense of futility and further discouraged senior class involvement.<br /><br />\nSecuring a position<br />\nThe appointment of Lou Giangiulio to the<br />\nsearch committee for a new Hopkins president<br />\nis an unexpected boon. After all, student contact with the Board of Trustees has been limited<br />\nto the occasional protest outside of Board<br />\nmeetings. The Trustees have preferred to<br />\nreceive their student viewpoint from the Young<br />\nTrustees, whose positions they created to meet<br />\nthis specific need.<br />\nEvents of the last year, however, have<br />\ndemonstrated that undergraduates desire more<br />\ninput into decisions that will affect them. The<br />\nFebruary brouhaha over the Five-Year Plan was<br />\ndue not<br />\nmuch to objections over the plan<br /><br />\nitself, but rather to students' lack of involvement in its drafting and fears of being left out<br />\nof its implementation.<br />\nBut it is noteworthy that the addition of a student to the committee is due to exhaustive efforts on the part of Giangiulio. Were it not for<br />\nhis initiative, this in all probability would never<br />\nhave occurred. We commend Giangiulio for his<br />\nenergy and note the precedent that his appointment to the committee sets in terms of administrative sensitivity to student concerns. We<br />\ncan only hope that it bodes well for further student involvement in the future.<br /><br />\nby James Rosen<br /><br />\nDue to incredible incompetence last week, we mislaid Rosen 's cartoon strip and were forced to reprint<br />\none of \"Rosen 's best.\" It was all our fault, and to make up for it, this week we're running both last<br />\nweek's and this week's strip.

I suggest a way<br />\nto challenge the practice of drug<br />\ntesting with no risk involved for<br />\nfuture employees.<br />\nDrug testing is a convenient<br />\nmethod for employers to probe<br />\ninto the personal lives of their<br />\nemployees. An employee's conduct after work hours is open to<br />\nscrutiny and approval according<br />\nto an employer's standards.<br />\nHowever, an employee's requirement is to provide skills at the<br />\nworkplace.

This will<br />\nraise capital for the construction<br />\nof new buildings, allow<br />\nstrengthening of library and<br />\nfinancial aid facilities, and help<br />\nDuke move up in prestige.<br />\nCase Western Reserve, according to Provost Richard Zdonis,<br />\nformer Vice Provost at Hopkins,<br />\nis more centralized than the<br />\nHopkins model All budgeting is<br /><br />\ndone by the central administration, which allows greater<br />\namounts of interdisciplinary<br />\nresearch and teaching. Each of<br />\nthe three faculties (Engineering,<br />\nScience and Math, and Arts and<br />\nSocial Sciences) gives a mandatory tax to a reserve fund that<br />\nsupports weaker divisions, and<br />\nalthough the faculties are selfcontained, they are operated as a<br />\nfiscal whole; the surpluses from<br />\neach go back into the main<br />\ncollege.<br />\nColumbia University has a fairly decentralized model, although<br />\nnot as decentralized as Hopkins.<br />\nAs explained by Dr. Michael<br />\nMooney, deputy Provost, the<br />\nUniversity is divided into units,<br />\nor schools; each forms a budget<br />\nfrom endowments it specifically<br />\nreceives The centralized administration has control over the<br /><br />\nunrestricted money, which it<br />\nallocates the units according to a<br />\nformula. The \"Arts and Sciences<br />\nConstruct\" is the largest of the<br />\nunrestricted budgetary units.<br />\nAside from these unrestricted<br />\nallotments, the units are given<br />\nfreedom to budget their own programs as they see fit. Each unit<br />\nis given a target that is the difference between budgeted<br />\nrevenues and budgeted expenses.<br />\nIf in one unit revenues are greater<br />\nthan expected, or expenses less,<br />\nthe unit may keep its profit,<br />\nwhich serves as an incentive program to save money. The centralized university sets these<br />\ntargets and controls the minimum<br />\namount a school can increase its<br />\ntuition, above which it may do<br />\nwhat it likes, keeping the surplus.<br /><br />\nBURGER KING<br />\nFast food restaurants<br />\nsurface along Greenmount<br />\nby Eric Ruck<br />\nOne thing that is particularly<br />\nunusual for Hopkins, as a college<br />\ncommunity, is the conspicuous<br />\nlack of fast food restaurants on or<br />\nnext to campus.<br />\nThere are in fact a number of<br />\nfast food restaurants hidden in the<br /><br />\nNEW US C HOT PRICES<br />\nIF IT'S HOT ON THE CHARTS IT'S ON SALE AT<br />\nSQUARE CIRC<br />\n-2W41'<br /><br />\n.N-<br /><br />\n1<br /><br />\n1<br /><br />\nSALE THRU 4/20/89/<br /><br />\nARTIST<br />\nTITLE<br /><br />\n\u2022LP'S WHERE AVAILABLE<br /><br />\n-)4t<br /><br />\n7-4<br />\nt<br />\n,<br />\nci1,<br /><br />\n(,\u2018.<br />\nct<br /><br />\nI XTC<br />\n7 I ORANGES&amp; LEMONS<br /><br />\n1 6.99<br /><br />\n0 I ELVIS COSTELLO<br /><br />\n1 6.99 10.99<br /><br />\n7 I SPIKE<br />\nin I THE REPLACEMENTS<br />\n3 '\" I DON'T TELL A SOUL<br />\n2<br /><br />\n4<br /><br />\nA4,<br />\n,,,<br />\n,-, q- &lt;, C.,<br /><br />\n4<br /><br />\n1 ROBYN HITCHCOCK/EGYPTIANS<br />\nQUEEN ELVIS<br /><br />\nii I FINE YOUNG CANNIBALS<br />\n5 \" I THE RAW&amp; THE COOKED<br />\nA<br /><br />\n6<br /><br />\n't<br /><br />\n7<br /><br />\n8<br /><br />\nI NEW ORDER<br />\nI<br /><br />\nTECH N IQU E<br /><br />\n1 THROWING MUSES<br />\nHUNKPAPA<br /><br />\n5 I GUADALCANAL DIARY<br />\nI FLIP-FLOP<br />\nFEMMES<br />\n9 10 1VIOLENT<br />\n3<br />\nn 1 EASTERHOUSE<br />\n10 7 1 WAITING FOR THE REDBIRD<br />\n8<br /><br />\nPIARE<br />\nM<br />\n/<br /><br />\n10.99<br /><br />\n1 6.99 10.99<br />\n1<br /><br />\n6.99 10.99<br /><br />\n1 6.99 10.99<br />\n1<br /><br />\n6.99 10.99<br /><br />\n1<br /><br />\n6.9910.99<br /><br />\n1 6.99 10.99<br />\n1 6.99 10.99<br />\n1 6.99 10.99<br /><br />\nrNE<br />\n,<br />\nDSDRT<br />\nIC1889-3855<br />\nBALTIMORE,A<br /><br />\narea, in the Greenmount shopping district.<br />\nThe Waverly Subway Sandwiches and Salads is located at<br />\n3400 Greenmount Avenue. The<br />\nname contains a reasonable<br />\ndescription of the food, and<br />\ncoupons are available in the<br />\nMoneymania booklets distributed<br />\nto all students.<br />\nAt 28th Street there is a trio of<br />\nnational fast food franchises, a<br />\nrepresentation of three of the<br />\nlargest chains. At the southwest<br />\ncorner there sits the brand-new<br />\nMcDonald's, in the shopping<br />\ncenter southeast there is a Burger<br />\nKing, and to the northeast stands<br />\nKentucky Fried Chicken.<br />\nAlthough many students, particularly the ones who live as far<br />\nfrom campus as 28th Street, tend<br />\nto eat lunch on campus, these<br />\nrestaurants can provide a quick<br />\nsource of breakfast, as well as an<br />\neasy dinner after classes.<br />\nSomewhat closer to campus, at<br />\nthe corner of Greenmount and<br />\n33rd Streets, is Mama Lucia, a<br />\nplace where one can get quick<br />\nItalian food. Although this is not<br />\ntechnically a fast food restaurant,<br />\nthe format is very similar, and<br />\nbooth-style seating and backlit,<br />\nhanging menus, as well as the<br />\nspeed of the service, add to the<br />\natmosphere.<br />\nWhy come all the way to<br />\nGreenmount Avenue when food<br />\nis as close as the deli or one of<br />\nthe carryouts on St. Paul Street?<br />\n\"The Delli's too crowded, and<br />\nCC's too greasy. The food is better here,\" says Mama Lucia<br />\npatron Michael Hendricks.<br />\nIn addition to the food, Greenmount is a busy shopping district.<br />\nThis is an attraction to the<br />\nHopkins students who are aware<br />\nof it.<br />\nBurger King is near stores like<br />\nSportsman, Western Auto, Stop<br />\nShop and Save, yet another Rite<br />\nAid, and King's Mart. To the<br />\npeople on the east side of campus,<br />\nthese stores are closer than the<br />\nones in Hamden.<br />\nThere are a number of students<br />\nwho are concerned about the safety of the Greenmount area. Jared<br />\nBrennan says that although he<br />\ndoes eat fast food on occassion,<br />\nhe would not be likely to go to<br />\nGreenmount, and certainly not as<br />\nfar south as 28th street, to get it.<br />\n\"I didn't know there were any<br />\nfast food restaurants over there.<br />\nNow that I know, I'd say I don't<br />\nlike the neighborhood.\"<br />\nEric Hymowitz, a student who<br />\ndrives the security van, says he<br />\nhas no reservations about going<br />\nover to Greenmount to pick up a<br />\nquick bite, and he even does so<br />\non occassion. He does not,<br />\nhowever, recommend it to<br />\nstudents who are worried about it.<br />\n\"The best advice would be<br />\n'don't go,' if you're afraid of it.<br />\nHe noted that the security van<br />\ndoes go that far.<br /><br />\nNEWS-LETTER/19<br /><br />\nDiverse acts perform in Showcase<br />\nStudents perform a wide range of music, from classical to popular<br />\nSHOWCASE, from 16<br />\nin the Hopkins Jazz Ensemble,<br />\ngave a performance that evoked<br />\nJazz, Dixieland, and Disneyland<br />\nat once.<br />\nAt the end of the program was<br />\nJohn Einhaus, who performed a<br />\nRachmaninoff prelude, and Atul<br />\nSachdev, who accompanied<br />\nhimself on piano as he sung \"I'll<br />\nSmile With You.\" The tune was<br />\nan original, Sachdev said, that he<br /><br />\nAnyone who has<br />\nwalked on the<br />\nShriver quad during<br />\none of the choir's<br />\nrehearsals<br />\nand<br />\nheard the singing as<br />\nfar<br />\naway<br />\nas<br />\nMaryland Hall can<br />\nimagine how this<br />\ngroup can fill a<br />\ntheater with sound.<br />\nwrote for his girlfriend \"because<br />\nI love her\u2014and this is a great way<br />\nto kiss her ass.\"<br />\nAfter the last performance, the<br />\njudges\u2014Dr. Susan Boswell, Dr.<br />\nJakie Hall, and Mrs. Kathy<br />\nWachsman\u2014left the theater to<br />\nmake their decisions. At this<br />\npoint Tennison, the winner of last<br /><br />\nyear's Showcase, entertained the<br />\naudience with original music that<br />\nhe played on synthesizers. His<br />\nequipment played most of the first<br />\ntwo pieces (\"Funk You\" and<br />\n\"Fanfare for the Ordinary<br />\nDude\") and he played the final<br />\npiece, \"Dissonance Boogie\"<br />\nlive, his keyboard sounding like<br />\na digitally-sampled piano.<br />\nThe judges returned at the end<br />\nof the piece, and announced that<br />\nLou Giangiulio was the winner in<br />\nthe \"miscellaneous\" category; in<br />\n\"classical,\" Michele Pineda; in<br />\n\"pop,\" Lovejoy and his Nuclear<br />\nBand. The JHU Gospel Choir<br />\nwas the overall winner of the<br />\nShowcase.<br />\n\"There was a lot of good<br />\ntalent,\" said Choir member Pat<br />\nBrown, \"so we were surprised<br />\nand moved when we won. We're<br />\nvery proud of our directors,<br />\nmusicians, ourselves.\"<br />\nAlthough most Choir members<br />\nare Hopkins students, Brown is a<br />\nUniversity employee in the Office<br />\nof Minority Affairs, and Choir<br />\nDirector Kevin Rogers works in<br />\nthe University's accounting<br />\ndepartment.<br />\nThough staged as a competition, the Showcase is hardly a<br />\ncutthroat affair. John Tennison<br />\nsaid he knew nothing of his victory last year. \"Either I won<br />\nsomething and I didn't know<br />\nabout it or I didn't really win<br />\nanything. I'm not sure,\" he said.<br />\nTennison declined to compete<br /><br />\n-..---....-----\".-.-<br /><br />\nThe oft-used piano is a symbol of the many offerings of the Musical Showcase.<br />\nin this year's showcase to avoid<br />\nhauling the many digital instruments he would need. Instead, he volunteered to join the<br />\nCommittee and to play during the<br />\njudging of the contest. He was offered the chance to head the<br />\nShowcase Committee, but turned<br />\ndown the opportunity.<br />\n\"I've been on that committee<br />\nsince freshman year,\" he said. \"I<br />\ndid this 'Funk You' thing and I<br />\nwas chaired out. I had my fill of<br /><br />\nadministration and I wanted to<br />\nwork on my compositions.\"<br />\nTennison said that this year's<br />\nShowcase was very similar to that<br />\nheld in 1988. He pointed out that<br />\nthe \"miscellaneous\" category<br />\nwas new, that Erika Horsey last<br />\nyear played the piano rather than<br />\nguitar, and that nothing on stage<br />\nlast year was as large as the<br />\nGospel Choir.<br />\nThe Musical Showcase was<br />\nfounded five years ago by Paul<br /><br />\nBrunetta, a former Housemaster<br />\nwho is now in medical school.<br />\nSays Director of Residential Life<br />\nAndrea Perry,\"He knew a lot of<br />\npeople who had a whole lot of<br />\ntalent that should get annual<br />\nshowing.\"<br />\n\"We're looking for more performers, especially freshmen,\"<br />\nPerry said.\"We want more people next year.\"<br /><br />\nYOU GOTTA BE THERE!<br />\nCollege Night at Memorial Stadium<br />\nWednesday, May 3<br />\nOrioles vs. California Angels<br />\n7:35 p.m.<br />\nGame Time<br />\nAmmir<br /><br />\nTickets on sale in the Student<br />\nActivities Office through April 26<br />\n$2.00<br /><br />\nSponsored by the ICPB<br /><br />\n20/APRIL 14, 1989'<br /><br />\nACROSS<br /><br />\n=MEM M<br />\nUMMIIMM<br />\nauu UNIMMMNM<br />\nMM. =MM. \u2022MM.<br />\nMMIIMM<br />\nMMEMINIM<br />\nMIIMM<br />\nMM.= MMINIMMU<br />\nNM<br />\nIMMMM NM'<br />\nNMI= MEM.=<br />\nNEM MOM<br />\n8<br /><br />\n9<br /><br />\n10<br /><br />\n6<br /><br />\nMu<br /><br />\nMINIM<br /><br />\nMM.=<br /><br />\nMIIMM<br /><br />\nMaulMUM=<br />\nWIMM<br /><br />\nNM<br /><br />\n1 Restricted<br />\n6 Tossed<br />\n11 Automobile's<br />\nhome<br />\n12 Lodger<br />\n14 Paradise<br />\n15 Separate<br />\n17 Diphthong<br />\n18 Cloth measure<br />\n19 Once more<br />\n20 Piece out<br />\n21 Compass point<br />\n22 Gymnastic feat<br />\n23 Winter vehicle<br />\n24 Landed<br />\nproperties<br />\n26 Bridges<br />\n27 Word of sorrow<br />\n28 Close<br />\n29 Bread maker<br />\n31 Leanest<br /><br />\nI<br /><br />\nMUMMa=<br /><br />\n34 Poems<br />\n35 Brief<br />\n36 Chaldean city<br />\n37 Paid notices<br />\n38 Evade an<br />\nobligation<br /><br />\n39 Baker's product<br />\n40 Compass point<br />\n41 Shift<br />\n42 Temporary beds<br />\n43 Marine snail<br />\n45 Runs away to be<br />\nmarried<br />\n47 Narrow, flat<br />\nboards<br />\n48 Portions of<br />\nmedicine<br /><br />\nDOWN<br />\n1 Dippers<br />\n2 City in Russia<br />\n3 Container<br />\n4 Symbol fo silver<br />\n5 Alliances<br />\n6 Characteristic<br />\n7 Musical<br />\ninstrument<br />\n8 Decay<br />\n9 Printer's<br />\nmeasure<br />\n10 Enfeeble<br />\n11 Web-footed<br />\nbirds<br /><br />\n13 Loom devices<br />\n16 Shallow vessels<br />\n19 Essence<br />\n20 Raise the<br />\nspirit of<br />\n22 Transactions<br />\n23 Gush out<br />\n25 Seizes<br />\n26 Voracious fish<br />\n28 Frolicked<br />\n29 Brag<br />\n30 Snakes<br />\n31 Part of leg<br />\n32 Retinues<br />\n33 Lock of hair<br />\n35 Keeps clear of<br />\n38 Discharged a<br />\ngun<br />\n39 Head of<br />\nCa'holic<br />\nChurch<br />\n41 Music: as<br />\nwritten<br />\n42 Race of lettuce<br />\n44 Negative prefix<br />\n46 Behold!<br /><br />\nCOLLEGE PRESS SERVICE<br /><br />\nActivities Calendar<br />\nFRIDAY, APRIL 14<br /><br />\nSUNDAY, APRIL 16<br /><br />\nTHURSDAY, APRIL 20<br /><br />\n12-6 p.m. SPRING FAIR\u2014MARITIME '89.<br />\n4-6 p.m HOPPY HOUR\u2014Decker Garden.<br />\nAndrew Moffit performs.<br />\n7 p.m. Barnstormers present the Tony Awardwinning The Mystery of Edwin Drood\u2014<br />\nArellano Theater. $4 students, $6 general.<br />\nAudience chooses from over 500 endings!<br />\n8 p.m. Comedian Steven Wright performs\u2014<br />\nShriver Hall.

In the<br />\nHopkins record books, he ranks<br />\nfirst in career assists, fourth in<br />\ncareer goals, and first in overall<br />\npoints scored.<br />\n\"Over the yea's, the style of<br />\nplay (at Hopkins) has changed a<br />\nlot, going from a kick-and-run<br />\nteam to a more ball-control,<br />\nEuropean-style team. We've done<br />\nno better than we should have.<br />\nWe never beat a team that we<br />\nshouldn't have beaten. Something<br />\nwas lacking.<br />\n\"When we went to the NCAAs<br />\nin 1986, we played very well<br />\ntogether. When the coach<br />\n(Tierney) quit for another job<br />\nafterwards, the soccer program<br />\ncould've gone one of two ways:<br />\nBecome even better by pushing<br />\nsoccer and hiring a full-time,<br />\nqualified soccer coach\u2014like football, basketball, fencing, wrestling, baseball, and lacrosse<br />\nteams\u2014or stay the same by hiring a part-time coach with no time<br />\nfor recruiting and building a team<br />\nin the off-season.<br />\n\"The coaching situation is one<br />\nthat not too many people in the<br />\nsoccer program are happy with,<br />\nexcept possibly for Mr. Scott,<br />\nwho designed it so that an assistant lacrosse coach also takes the<br />\nresponsibility of head soccer<br />\ncoach. Coach Haus has come a<br />\nlong way. He was put in an extremely tough situation, because<br />\nhe's never played soccer before.<br />\nIf someone offered me the headsoccer-coach job at Duke or some<br />\nother great program and told me<br />\nI would also have to coach<br />\nlacrosse, I'd take it. But that<br />\nwouldn't be fair to the lacrosse<br />\nplayers.<br />\n\"Mr. Scott supports us and<br />\nwants us to win, but he doesn't<br />\nwant us to win as much as we did.<br />\nWhen you've got players putting<br />\nin at least thirty hours a week<br />\nthink he needs to be even more<br />\nsupportive. To him, winning<br />\neight games is a good season. It's<br />\nfrustrating when everyone on the<br />\nteam wants to win more than the<br />\nA.D. wants you to.<br />\n\"I'd say that we were one of<br />\nthe best teams in Division III soccer the past two years. There<br />\nwans't one team that we couldn't<br />\nhave beaten. Still, we kept playing the same level of competition<br /><br />\nyear after year instead of scheduling better teams.<br />\n\"I've given a bleak outlook of<br />\nthe program, but there's a<br />\ntradeoff. If the school pushed soccer, like lacrosse, then it wouldn't<br />\nbe as much fun. It wouldn't feel<br />\nlike our team. The soccer team is<br />\nours. The only pressure to win<br />\ncame from the players<br />\nthemselves. It's just great to play.<br />\nI hope that, in the future, the program will continue to improve.<br />\n\"The truth of the matter is that<br />\nthings aren't equal. The basketball team gets new shoes every<br />\nyear, and the baseball team gets<br />\nnew uniforms and dugouts. When<br />\nyou see that, and know that<br />\neveryone else on the team sees it,<br />\nyou get upset. A really nice grass<br />\nfield would be great instead of the<br />\nlower field. You can tell that the<br />\nmoney and attention isn't being<br />\nput into soccer, which is<br />\nfrustrating.\"<br />\nHowever, when Weinstein<br />\nlooks back on it all, the positives<br />\ncome to mind first.<br />\n\"Making the NCAAs will<br />\nalways be a highlight.

My freshman year, we had<br /><br />\na winning record, and I expected<br />\nthe team to get better with every<br />\nyear. After that season, there<br />\nseemed to be a transition in<br />\nleadership at the QB position,<br />\nwhich is so vital to the offense.<br />\nNo one could step in and be a<br />\nleader. Part of the problem was<br />\nthat coach Pfeifer, who always<br />\nprepares well for a game, would<br />\nabandon somettimg if it didn't<br />\nwork immediately, which usually resulted in a player being yanked. That takes away your<br />\nconfidence.<br />\n\"On any level\u2014high school,<br />\ncollege, or pro\u2014if you go 1-9,<br />\nthe first place everyone looks is<br />\nat the head coach, whether or not<br />\nit's his fault.

You have to<br />\nrelate to the players and not allow<br />\nthem to get down on themselves.<br />\n\"But there's more to all this.<br />\nOverall, the team needs to be<br />\nmore serious. For instance, not<br />\neveryone works out when they're<br />\nsupposed to. It's not good for the<br />\nfreshmen to have suffered<br />\nthrough a season like this past<br />\none. A lot of talking needs to be<br />\ndone between the coaches and<br />\nplayes. Also, the team needs to be<br />\nput on a strict weightlifting<br />\nschedule, which everyone should<br />\nfollow.<br />\n\"Next year's team already has<br />\nthe best talent in the [Centennial]<br />\nleague, but it will all depend on<br />\nthe players deciding for<br />\nthemselves to change their attitude, start working hard, and<br />\nfollow the coaches instead of being against them.
