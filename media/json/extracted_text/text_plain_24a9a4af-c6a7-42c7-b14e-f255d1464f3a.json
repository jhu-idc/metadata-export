This was passed<br />\nby the convention and the Penn<br />\nPunch Bowl was appointed editor.<br />\nThe question of employing a man<br />\nto take care of national advertising<br />\nwas deemed impracticable.

Also during the<br />\nevening there will be the presentation of the J. D. Clark bowling cup<br />\nwhich was won by the Classics Department. From 9 o'clock on there<br />\nwill be dancing.
