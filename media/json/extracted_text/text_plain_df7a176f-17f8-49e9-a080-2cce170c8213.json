But the film itself<br />\nlacked any ingenuity or<br />\nimagination. The only thing that<br />\nchanged was the kind of gimmick<br />\nused during the film. As a work<br />\nof art the film was just boring,\"<br />\nsaid Gardner.<br />\n\"One might notice that in all<br />\nthe films the \"actors\" are all<br />\nwhite, and under thirty This had<br />\ntwo basic effects: it implied that<br />\nonly these people have sex, and it<br />\ndepersonalized all the actors.<br />\nEveryone in all the films looked<br />\nthe same. Everybody was going<br />\nthrough the same, mochanical<br />\nmotions,\" said Emily Toth.<br />\nMost of the critics also felt the<br />\nfilm was, in effect, boring.<br />\n\"The film itself merely<br />\nrepresented two hours of sheer<br />\nboredom. Each different film<br />\nclipping was merely another use<br />\nof a gimmick to produce some<br />\nsort of humor. Basically, these<br />\nfilms are totally worthless.,\" said<br />\nPaul Walker.<br />\n\"The only use that I could<br />\n<br />\nthink for these films would,<br />\nperhaps, be for sex education,<br />\nmarital education, or some kind<br />\nof therapy,\" he added.<br />\n\"The .only film that, at least,<br />\npresented itself as a film was the<br />\none by Dr. John Money. This<br />\nfilm did attempt to individualize<br />\nthe actors, and get some audience<br />\nparticipation.

Considering<br />\nthat inflation has bee proceeding at a rate of close to ten<br />\npercent a year since February, 1973 and that, according to<br />\nWayne Hood, associate director of financial aid, substantial<br />\nunutilized financial aid funds are still available, there should<br />\nbe no delay in putting the increase into effect.<br />\nAlthough Baltimore still does have a cost of living<br />\nsomewhat lower than that of other Eastern seaboard cities<br />\n(for example, apartment rents here are substantially lower<br />\nthar .they are in other areas) Hopkins students on financial<br />\naid are still hard-pressed to pay their tuition and their living<br />\nexpenses as well. While the argument may be raised that these<br />\nsurplus funds in the financial aid budget should be returned<br />\nto the central administration for re-allocation in the next<br />\nfiscal year, to perhaps a more vital function, it should be<br />\npointed out that there simply is no more vital function for<br />\nstudents here than that of financial aid.<br />\nOn the national scene, the financial aid picture seems<br />\nsomewhat unclear as well as the Nixon administration has<br />\nproposed a sharp cutback in the eligibility for certain loan<br />\nprograms.

Those of you who did<br />\nnot choose the right answer get our<br />\nconsolation prize, an autographed<br />\ncopy of Marc Duvoisin's latest<br />\nbook, I Was a Teenage Muckraker.<br />\nWhen I requested some space in<br />\nthe News-Letter my original 'idea<br />\nwas to write a rebuttal to some of<br />\nthe more blatantly erroneous<br />\ncharges (For example: I did not<br />\nsubmit a symposium topic, I did<br />\nnot even see any topics until after<br />\nthe submission deadline, I have<br />\nnever \"sat in\" on any selections<br />\ncommittee meetings etc., etc.)<br />\n<br />\nRather than use this space for a<br />\nrebuttal, I would like to make<br />\nsome statements concerning the<br />\nStudent Council and .Student<br />\nGovernment in general.<br />\nMany students feel that the<br />\nStudent Council is, at worst, a<br />\ntotal waste of time and at best, a<br />\ngroup of well intentioned student's<br />\nwho really have no power to effect<br />\nanything important. This, I believe<br />\nis partially true.<br />\nWhen I was a freshman, I had<br />\nthe displeasure to sit on a Student<br />\nCouncil which was an absolute<br />\nwaste of time. Fully half of the<br />\nmeeting never occured because we<br />\ncouldn't get enough members for a<br />\nquorum. When we did meet it was<br />\nusually to discuss how we could<br />\nbest abolish the Council. We were<br />\nso ineffective that we couldn't<br />\neven get rid of ourselves.<br />\nI now have the honor of<br />\npresiding over what must be one of<br />\nthe best Student Councils in the<br />\nhistory of JHU. Each member puts<br />\nin a minimum of four hours work<br />\nper week and I would guess that<br />\nmost members regard Student<br />\nCouncil as the equivalent of a sixth<br />\ncourse (no gut, this). The most<br />\ngratifying thing is that these 19<br />\nstudents really care about what is<br />\n<br />\nhappening to undergraduates at<br />\nHopkins.<br />\nWhenever you talk about<br />\nstudent Government the question<br />\nirievitably arises, \"Do they have<br />\nany power? Can the S.C. really do<br />\na'nything'?\" :To these questions I<br />\nWould ,answer \"yes and no\" and<br />\n'before I read an article entitled<br />\n\"SC PRESIDENT SEEN AS<br />\nINDECISIVE\" let me explain.<br />\nAs I see it, there are basically<br />\ntwo types of tasks that the Student<br />\nCouncil performs. The first type<br />\nconsists of internal business in<br />\nwhich the Council has absolute<br />\npower. These chores include<br />\nappointing students to committees,<br />\nselection of chairmen for various<br />\njobs, approving student activity<br />\nbudgets etc.<br />\nThe second group of<br />\nresponsibilities (which I feel . are<br />\nmuch more important) is in an area<br />\nwhere unfortunately, the Student<br />\nCouncil has no real power. This is<br />\nin dealing with the faculty and<br />\nadministration.<br />\nBelieve it or not, most people<br />\nifeel that the University exists<br />\nprimarily to serve the Students.<br />\n(This is true of faculty and<br />\nadministration although more true<br />\nof the administration). Therefore,<br />\n<br />\nletters to the editor<br />\nSuskind Stops<br />\nTo the Editor:<br />\nDean Suskind now wants to stop<br />\ncredits for minimester courses.<br />\nWhat an apt time to raise the same<br />\nquestion on a wider scope. If<br />\nintersession courses, which have<br />\nbeen legitimized by several years of<br />\ncreditable existence along with the<br />\ntwo long terms, should we not<br />\nwonder why the courses offered in<br />\nthe Spring and Fall should<br />\ncontinue to be credited?

Simple. The Spring<br />\nterm ends a month earlier and the<br />\nlikes of Prof. Sampson can be rid<br />\nof undergraduates that much<br />\nsooner. The Chairman of<br />\nMathematics seems more interested<br />\nin graduate level work. Where does<br />\nhe imagine graduate students come<br />\nfrom? Are they perhaps wafted<br />\ninto graduate departments on<br />\nclouds of topological theorems<br />\nfrom Hilbert spaces nestled in the<br />\nuttermost parts of some journal he<br />\nhappens to edit?<br />\nProf. Sampson's attitude is<br />\ncommon. Students exist because<br />\nfaculties exist. It's quite the other<br />\nway around. So now<br />\nundergraduates want to exercise<br />\ntheir Aristotelian right to desire to<br />\nknow what they are interested<br />\nin(not as in the terms when it's<br />\nwhat the instructor is interested in)<br />\nand get credit for it.<br />\nDean Suskind seems to think the<br />\nadministration is endowed with the<br />\nprerogative of applying its<br />\narbitrary scalpel where prejudice<br />\nsees fit: Academic modifications<br />\nare the exclusive province of the<br />\nfaculty. When the highest councils<br />\nof the teachers review the essential<br />\nissue, namely responding to the<br />\nnative but damageable curiosity of<br />\nthe student, I hope they will<br />\nremember how they put an end to<br />\nsuch Dean's office shenanigans last<br />\nterm as regards the pass/fail<br />\noption.

The problem with<br />\nletting students make decisions (as<br />\nI am told) is that because of the<br />\nrapid rate of student turnover,<br />\nthere is no consistency in student<br />\ndecisions. Although this this line of<br />\nreasoning is hard for me to swallow<br />\nI can see that it is true. For<br />\nexample, in 1969 the Student<br />\nCouncil (under the Presidency of<br />\nRuss Passarella \u2014 now Young<br />\nTrustee) pushed to abolish the<br />\nreading period (before exams) in<br />\nlieu of establishing a minimester.<br />\nRecently, a group of students<br />\ncontacted me wanting to reinstate<br />\nthe reading period and abolish<br />\nintersession. The fact is, that what<br />\nthis years students push for, next<br />\nyears students may push against.<br />\nThus, important decisions in areas<br />\nsuch as academics, housing and<br />\nadmissions are left up to<br />\nadministration and faculty because<br />\nthey can view these decisions in<br />\nthe \"long term.\"<br />\nWhere does the Student Council<br />\nfit into this brilliant analysis?<br />\n<br />\nthe Academic Council (which<br />\nmakes many important academic<br />\ndecisions) or the chairmen of<br />\ndepartments (they make the rest)<br />\nwe go as advisors. We can cajole,<br />\nplead, threaten and sometimes<br />\ndemand, but it is they who make<br />\nthe decisions.<br />\nProgress<br />\nThis year, the Student Council<br />\ndecided to concentrate on<br />\nacademic matters and we're<br />\nmaking some progress. The point is<br />\nthat when you're dealing under<br />\nthese circumstances it takes a lot<br />\nof time and a lot of patience. You<br />\nmay say that John Colmers is my<br />\nlackey, but I'll be damned if he<br />\ndoesn't have the respect of that<br />\nentire Academic Council. You may<br />\nsay that Hoffman is part of the<br />\nadministration but I'll be damned<br />\nif the chairmen don't sit up when<br />\nhe starts talking.

As a work<br />\nof art the film was just boring,\"<br />\nsaid Gardner.<br />\n\"One might notice that in all<br />\nthe films the \"actors\" are all<br />\nwhite, and under thirty This had<br />\ntwo basic effects: it implied that<br />\nonly these people have sex, and it<br />\ndepersonalized all the actors.<br />\nEveryone in all the films looked<br />\nthe same.

Considering<br />\nthat inflation has bee proceeding at a rate of close to ten<br />\npercent a year since February, 1973 and that, according to<br />\nWayne Hood, associate director of financial aid, substantial<br />\nunutilized financial aid funds are still available, there should<br />\nbe no delay in putting the increase into effect.<br />\nAlthough Baltimore still does have a cost of living<br />\nsomewhat lower than that of other Eastern seaboard cities<br />\n(for example, apartment rents here are substantially lower<br />\nthar .they are in other areas) Hopkins students on financial<br />\naid are still hard-pressed to pay their tuition and their living<br />\nexpenses as well. While the argument may be raised that these<br />\nsurplus funds in the financial aid budget should be returned<br />\nto the central administration for re-allocation in the next<br />\nfiscal year, to perhaps a more vital function, it should be<br />\npointed out that there simply is no more vital function for<br />\nstudents here than that of financial aid.<br />\nOn the national scene, the financial aid picture seems<br />\nsomewhat unclear as well as the Nixon administration has<br />\nproposed a sharp cutback in the eligibility for certain loan<br />\nprograms.

Those of you who did<br />\nnot choose the right answer get our<br />\nconsolation prize, an autographed<br />\ncopy of Marc Duvoisin's latest<br />\nbook, I Was a Teenage Muckraker.<br />\nWhen I requested some space in<br />\nthe News-Letter my original 'idea<br />\nwas to write a rebuttal to some of<br />\nthe more blatantly erroneous<br />\ncharges (For example: I did not<br />\nsubmit a symposium topic, I did<br />\nnot even see any topics until after<br />\nthe submission deadline, I have<br />\nnever \"sat in\" on any selections<br />\ncommittee meetings etc., etc.)<br /><br />\nRather than use this space for a<br />\nrebuttal, I would like to make<br />\nsome statements concerning the<br />\nStudent Council and .Student<br />\nGovernment in general.<br />\nMany students feel that the<br />\nStudent Council is, at worst, a<br />\ntotal waste of time and at best, a<br />\ngroup of well intentioned student's<br />\nwho really have no power to effect<br />\nanything important. This, I believe<br />\nis partially true.<br />\nWhen I was a freshman, I had<br />\nthe displeasure to sit on a Student<br />\nCouncil which was an absolute<br />\nwaste of time. Fully half of the<br />\nmeeting never occured because we<br />\ncouldn't get enough members for a<br />\nquorum. When we did meet it was<br />\nusually to discuss how we could<br />\nbest abolish the Council. We were<br />\nso ineffective that we couldn't<br />\neven get rid of ourselves.<br />\nI now have the honor of<br />\npresiding over what must be one of<br />\nthe best Student Councils in the<br />\nhistory of JHU. Each member puts<br />\nin a minimum of four hours work<br />\nper week and I would guess that<br />\nmost members regard Student<br />\nCouncil as the equivalent of a sixth<br />\ncourse (no gut, this). The most<br />\ngratifying thing is that these 19<br />\nstudents really care about what is<br /><br />\nhappening to undergraduates at<br />\nHopkins.<br />\nWhenever you talk about<br />\nstudent Government the question<br />\nirievitably arises, \"Do they have<br />\nany power? Can the S.C. really do<br />\na'nything'?\" :To these questions I<br />\nWould ,answer \"yes and no\" and<br />\n'before I read an article entitled<br />\n\"SC PRESIDENT SEEN AS<br />\nINDECISIVE\" let me explain.<br />\nAs I see it, there are basically<br />\ntwo types of tasks that the Student<br />\nCouncil performs. The first type<br />\nconsists of internal business in<br />\nwhich the Council has absolute<br />\npower. These chores include<br />\nappointing students to committees,<br />\nselection of chairmen for various<br />\njobs, approving student activity<br />\nbudgets etc.<br />\nThe second group of<br />\nresponsibilities (which I feel . are<br />\nmuch more important) is in an area<br />\nwhere unfortunately, the Student<br />\nCouncil has no real power. This is<br />\nin dealing with the faculty and<br />\nadministration.<br />\nBelieve it or not, most people<br />\nifeel that the University exists<br />\nprimarily to serve the Students.<br />\n(This is true of faculty and<br />\nadministration although more true<br />\nof the administration). Therefore,<br /><br />\nletters to the editor<br />\nSuskind Stops<br />\nTo the Editor:<br />\nDean Suskind now wants to stop<br />\ncredits for minimester courses.<br />\nWhat an apt time to raise the same<br />\nquestion on a wider scope.

Simple. The Spring<br />\nterm ends a month earlier and the<br />\nlikes of Prof. Sampson can be rid<br />\nof undergraduates that much<br />\nsooner. The Chairman of<br />\nMathematics seems more interested<br />\nin graduate level work. Where does<br />\nhe imagine graduate students come<br />\nfrom? Are they perhaps wafted<br />\ninto graduate departments on<br />\nclouds of topological theorems<br />\nfrom Hilbert spaces nestled in the<br />\nuttermost parts of some journal he<br />\nhappens to edit?<br />\nProf. Sampson's attitude is<br />\ncommon. Students exist because<br />\nfaculties exist. It's quite the other<br />\nway around. So now<br />\nundergraduates want to exercise<br />\ntheir Aristotelian right to desire to<br />\nknow what they are interested<br />\nin(not as in the terms when it's<br />\nwhat the instructor is interested in)<br />\nand get credit for it.<br />\nDean Suskind seems to think the<br />\nadministration is endowed with the<br />\nprerogative of applying its<br />\narbitrary scalpel where prejudice<br />\nsees fit: Academic modifications<br />\nare the exclusive province of the<br />\nfaculty. When the highest councils<br />\nof the teachers review the essential<br />\nissue, namely responding to the<br />\nnative but damageable curiosity of<br />\nthe student, I hope they will<br />\nremember how they put an end to<br />\nsuch Dean's office shenanigans last<br />\nterm as regards the pass/fail<br />\noption.

The problem with<br />\nletting students make decisions (as<br />\nI am told) is that because of the<br />\nrapid rate of student turnover,<br />\nthere is no consistency in student<br />\ndecisions. Although this this line of<br />\nreasoning is hard for me to swallow<br />\nI can see that it is true. For<br />\nexample, in 1969 the Student<br />\nCouncil (under the Presidency of<br />\nRuss Passarella \u2014 now Young<br />\nTrustee) pushed to abolish the<br />\nreading period (before exams) in<br />\nlieu of establishing a minimester.<br />\nRecently, a group of students<br />\ncontacted me wanting to reinstate<br />\nthe reading period and abolish<br />\nintersession. The fact is, that what<br />\nthis years students push for, next<br />\nyears students may push against.<br />\nThus, important decisions in areas<br />\nsuch as academics, housing and<br />\nadmissions are left up to<br />\nadministration and faculty because<br />\nthey can view these decisions in<br />\nthe \"long term.\"<br />\nWhere does the Student Council<br />\nfit into this brilliant analysis?<br /><br />\nthe Academic Council (which<br />\nmakes many important academic<br />\ndecisions) or the chairmen of<br />\ndepartments (they make the rest)<br />\nwe go as advisors.

The point is<br />\nthat when you're dealing under<br />\nthese circumstances it takes a lot<br />\nof time and a lot of patience. You<br />\nmay say that John Colmers is my<br />\nlackey, but I'll be damned if he<br />\ndoesn't have the respect of that<br />\nentire Academic Council. You may<br />\nsay that Hoffman is part of the<br />\nadministration but I'll be damned<br />\nif the chairmen don't sit up when<br />\nhe starts talking.

Formerly the<br />\nCarling Club and a powerhouse in<br />\nclub ranks, Pyle tied Maryland in<br />\na similar scrimmage Saturday.<br />\nHopkins will then host the<br />\nMaryland Lacrosse Club at 1:30<br />\nSaturday.<br /><br />\n\"I was impressed with the way<br />\nwe went out after them,\" said<br />\nassistant coach Henry Ciccarone<br />\nof the Hopkins effort against<br />\nPenn. So were a lot of other<br />\npeople as the Blue Jays were all<br />\nover the Quakers through much<br />\nof the scrimmage.<br />\n\"Because of the weather, we're<br />\na lot further along this spring<br />\nthan I've seen in the past few<br />\nyears,\" Ciccarone continued.<br />\nCertainly the defense comes<br />\ninto this season with more<br />\nexperience and skill then in any<br /><br />\nrecent year. Although not really<br />\ntested by Penn, the defense<br />\nlooked awesome Saturday,<br />\nhaving worked hard all week to<br />\nreach that stage of development.<br />\nOffensively, there is little<br />\nquestion about the proficiency of<br />\nthe attack. Jack Thomas was<br />\nomnipresent while on the field.<br />\nThe senior All-American figured<br />\nin eight of the Blue Jays goal,<br />\nscoring four and feeding for the<br />\nothers. Sophomore Franz<br />\nWittelsberger added three of his<br />\nown to add to the Penn misery.<br /><br />"}], "field_media_file": [{"target_id": 40883, "display": null, "description": null, "target_type": "file", "target_uuid": "734ea3dc-e25a-489a-b653-56e9808d3d38", "url": "http://digital.library.jhu.edu/system/files/2022-03/14212-Extracted%20Text.txt"}], "field_media_of": [{"target_id": 14212, "target_type": "node", "target_uuid": "89a9163d-05b4-4b9b-b59f-c807b3f6becf", "url": "/node/14212"}], "field_media_use": [{"target_id": 15, "target_type": "taxonomy_term", "target_uuid": "c6a3a700-c007-4c4f-b77a-403d89b54878", "url": "/taxonomy/term/15"}], "field_mime_type": [{"value": "text/plain"}], "field_restricted_access": [], "field_unique_id": [{"value": "60ed347a-935a-41ac-bb4c-4c7786ea6051"}]}
