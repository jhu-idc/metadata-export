The speech was<br />\none in the Round Table Talks sponsored by Delta Sigma Pi, a professional fraternity in the field of business.<br />\nExplaining the relation or Inc<br />\nAmerican social order to the New<br />\nDeal, Dr. Mattern stated that in its<br />\nearly days the American society was<br />\nrelatively simple and harmonious and<br />\ntherefore chose the democratic system as its political organization; for<br />\nsince the social order was not complicated, it necessitated a government which performed a minimum of<br />\nfunctions. \"But since that time the<br />\nsocial order of the United States has<br />\nchanged,\" he said.<br />\nComplicated ,Today<br />\n\"Today it is as complicated as it<br />\nonce was simple, as distracted as it<br />\nonce was harmonious. There is in evidence today a large number of interest groups which are not only in<br />\nbut in deadly<br />\nvicious competition<br />\nconflict with each other.\" In this<br />\nkind of a society, explained Dr. Mattern, the government should have assigned to it a larger number of functions. And thus the catastrophes<br />\nwhich have befallen the governments<br />\nof Russia, Germany, and Italy are<br />\nexplained by the political scientist,<br />\nwho has reached the conclusion that<br />\n-\"disaster follows the failure to assign to government the functions<br />\nwhich an unsocially minded order<br />\nleaves undone.

Dr. Mattern's<br />\nviews were expressed in an address<br />\ndelivered over<br /><br />\nStation<br /><br />\nWBAL<br /><br />\non<br /><br />\nThursday, March 5. The speech was<br />\none in the Round Table Talks sponsored by Delta Sigma Pi, a professional fraternity in the field of business.<br />\nExplaining the relation or Inc<br />\nAmerican social order to the New<br />\nDeal, Dr. Mattern stated that in its<br />\nearly days the American society was<br />\nrelatively simple and harmonious and<br />\ntherefore chose the democratic system as its political organization; for<br />\nsince the social order was not complicated, it necessitated a government which performed a minimum of<br />\nfunctions. \"But since that time the<br />\nsocial order of the United States has<br />\nchanged,\" he said.<br />\nComplicated ,Today<br />\n\"Today it is as complicated as it<br />\nonce was simple, as distracted as it<br />\nonce was harmonious. There is in evidence today a large number of interest groups which are not only in<br />\nbut in deadly<br />\nvicious competition<br />\nconflict with each other.\" In this<br />\nkind of a society, explained Dr. Mattern, the government should have assigned to it a larger number of functions. And thus the catastrophes<br />\nwhich have befallen the governments<br />\nof Russia, Germany, and Italy are<br />\nexplained by the political scientist,<br />\nwho has reached the conclusion that<br />\n-\"disaster follows the failure to assign to government the functions<br />\nwhich an unsocially minded order<br />\nleaves undone.

This<br />\nwill be due chiefly to the addition of<br />\ntwo freshmen to the varsity aggregation, both of whom were unbeaten<br />\nin meets against local high schools<br />\nthis season.
