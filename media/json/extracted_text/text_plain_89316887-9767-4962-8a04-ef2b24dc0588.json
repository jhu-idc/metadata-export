With the proper co-operation on the part of the student body, the bureau Should approach<br />\nan efficiency of 100 per cent.<br />\nHowever, through either an ignorance of the existence of such<br />\na bureau, or through intentional neglect, lost property has, time and<br />\nagain, been withheld from its proper owners.

Kavanaugh, secretary of the Philadelphia section,<br />\nhas extended the Hopkins chapter<br />\na very hearty invitation and seems<br />\nvery keen to have representatives<br />\nfrom this institution come over. In<br />\nview of the fact that this is the first<br />\ntime in the history of Hopkins that<br />\na body of mechanical engineering<br />\nstudents are participating in such a<br />\nconvention, the trip over is considered of great importance. It is<br />\nhoped that this will pave the way<br />\nfor our rapidly growing organization and make it possible for the<br />\nHopkins section to attend each annual congress.<br />\nSuch meetings of students from<br />\nall parts of the country afford an<br />\nOpportunity for better understanding among the men of the younger<br />\nengineering world. By intercourse<br />\nWith students from elsewhere an<br />\nengineering education may be obtained such as never could be offered by any individual institution.<br />\nThe information is supplemented,<br />\nfrequently rectified the view is<br />\nbroadened and new ideas are instituted. The result is a young engineer of broader vision and one better fitted for the practice of the profession. This insures a mechanical<br />\nengineering profession of high<br />\ncalibre and the maintenance of its<br />\nstatus on an elevated plane.<br />\nThe program is quite extensive<br />\nand covers several items which<br />\nPromise to be most inspiring.

If a power need develops, and its<br />\nlocation is more than a few hundred yards from<br />\nthe power house, the engineer at once turns to<br />\nthe electrical method for cheap and reliable<br />\ntransmission.<br />\nTo the thousands who are living their lives in<br />\nthe earlier days of the Electrical Age,it probably<br />\nseems that this situation must have always<br />\nexisted. But actually, there is many a man with<br />\nno gray in his hair can recall the days when<br />\nelectric light and power were literally unknown.<br />\nThe tremendous electrical transmission systems that have been developed during the past<br />\nthirty years owe their existence to the fact that<br />\nthey are practically, as well as technically,<br />\nright. They provide cheaper power than would<br />\notherwise be possible; and production, and the<br />\ncreation of real values, always requires comparatively low-priced power for its highest<br />\ndevelopment. And the history of low-cost<br />\npower transmission is the history of Alternating<br />\nCurrent, and especially of the Alternating Current Transformer. For one of the great factors<br />\nin the cost of electrical systems is the cost of conductors \u2014 wires\u2014 and the big thing about alternating current is that it makes possible the use of<br />\nconductors which are within the cost-limits which<br />\ncompetitive and economic conditions impose.<br />\n<br />\nThere is no room to discuss all the varied aspects of this question; but it may be said that<br />\none of the great fundamentals that has led to the<br />\nuse of alternating current transmission for about<br />\n95% of the electrical systems now in use has been<br />\nits great economy, as compared to other systems,<br />\nin the transmission of power. And the transformer, itself, is the heart of the alternating<br />\ncurrent system.<br />\nIt permits a small current, at high voltage, to<br />\nbe transformed to a large current at low voltage,<br />\nor vice versa,through the use of simple,immobile<br />\napparatus, and thus supplies the essential factor<br />\nin electrical transmission.<br />\nWilliam Stanley is remembered because it was<br />\nhe who commercially developed transformers of<br />\nhigh efficiency and satisfactory regulating qualities. He brought out the first system in which<br />\nthe transformers were connected in parallel,<br />\nacross a constant-potential system, instead of<br />\nthe series operation used by Gaulard and Gibbs.<br />\nThe system embodying this principle was put<br />\ninto operation at Great Barrington, Mass., on<br />\nMarch 16, 1886, and has been the standard<br />\nmethod ever since.<br />\nThus briefly is recorded the history of another contribution of the Westinghouse engineering organization to the electrical art; since<br />\nall the transformers which are made today are<br />\nbuilt upon the same general principles as those<br />\nfirst constructed to embody William Stanley's<br />\ninventions.<br />\n<br />\n\f", "format": "basic_html", "processed": "MUSICAL CLUBS SET FOR<br />\nANNUAL HOMEWOOD<br />\nCONCERT<br />\nTo Be Presented in C.

In<br />\nview of the fact that this is the first<br />\ntime in the history of Hopkins that<br />\na body of mechanical engineering<br />\nstudents are participating in such a<br />\nconvention, the trip over is considered of great importance. It is<br />\nhoped that this will pave the way<br />\nfor our rapidly growing organization and make it possible for the<br />\nHopkins section to attend each annual congress.<br />\nSuch meetings of students from<br />\nall parts of the country afford an<br />\nOpportunity for better understanding among the men of the younger<br />\nengineering world. By intercourse<br />\nWith students from elsewhere an<br />\nengineering education may be obtained such as never could be offered by any individual institution.<br />\nThe information is supplemented,<br />\nfrequently rectified the view is<br />\nbroadened and new ideas are instituted. The result is a young engineer of broader vision and one better fitted for the practice of the profession. This insures a mechanical<br />\nengineering profession of high<br />\ncalibre and the maintenance of its<br />\nstatus on an elevated plane.<br />\nThe program is quite extensive<br />\nand covers several items which<br />\nPromise to be most inspiring. Beginning with the inspection of the<br />\nDelaware Power Plant early in the<br />\nafternoon, the members will meet<br />\nat 6 R M. for dinner at the University of Pennsylvania. An hour<br />\nlater the engineering laboratories<br />\nWill be inspected, to be followed by<br />\nan address by Mr. W. L. Saunders<br />\nOn \"Forty-six Years Out of College,\" and by Mr. D. R. Yarnall on<br />\n\"The Value of Membership in a<br />\nNrational Society.\" The day will<br />\nbe concluded by the showing of one<br />\nof the most wonderful motion pictures of the engineering work ever<br />\nProduced: \"The Combustion in a<br />\nBoiler Furnace.\"<br />\nCHRISTIAN SERVICE CLUB MEETS<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS LETTER'S<br />\nMAILBAG<br /><br />\n111 11111<br />\n.<br />\n.<br />\n11 11Vallem11<br />\n11 .<br />\n.<br />\n111 .<br />\nI ly1<br />\n111 .<br />\n.<br /><br />\nA Column in Which the Correspondents<br />\nAre Allowed Latitude, But Shoulder the Responsibility.<br />\nAll letters intended for publication<br />\nmust be concise, written in ink on<br />\nregular letter size paper, on one side<br />\nonly.<br />\nNo attention will be paid to anonymous letters, but names signed as an<br />\nevidence of good faith will not be<br />\nprinted if request is made that they be<br />\nomitted.<br />\nThe publication of a letter is not to<br />\nbe taken as an indorsement of its views<br />\nby the \"News-Letter,\" which invites the<br />\nfreest discussion of matters of genera]<br />\ninterest.<br /><br />\nTo the Editor of the News-Letter.<br />\nDear Sir:<br />\n\"Politicus\" in the News-Letter<br />\nof March 10 objected to what he<br />\ncalled the \"graft\" of charging $10<br />\na page for writeups of activities<br />\nin the Hullabaloo.

If a power need develops, and its<br />\nlocation is more than a few hundred yards from<br />\nthe power house, the engineer at once turns to<br />\nthe electrical method for cheap and reliable<br />\ntransmission.<br />\nTo the thousands who are living their lives in<br />\nthe earlier days of the Electrical Age,it probably<br />\nseems that this situation must have always<br />\nexisted. But actually, there is many a man with<br />\nno gray in his hair can recall the days when<br />\nelectric light and power were literally unknown.<br />\nThe tremendous electrical transmission systems that have been developed during the past<br />\nthirty years owe their existence to the fact that<br />\nthey are practically, as well as technically,<br />\nright. They provide cheaper power than would<br />\notherwise be possible; and production, and the<br />\ncreation of real values, always requires comparatively low-priced power for its highest<br />\ndevelopment. And the history of low-cost<br />\npower transmission is the history of Alternating<br />\nCurrent, and especially of the Alternating Current Transformer. For one of the great factors<br />\nin the cost of electrical systems is the cost of conductors \u2014 wires\u2014 and the big thing about alternating current is that it makes possible the use of<br />\nconductors which are within the cost-limits which<br />\ncompetitive and economic conditions impose.<br /><br />\nThere is no room to discuss all the varied aspects of this question; but it may be said that<br />\none of the great fundamentals that has led to the<br />\nuse of alternating current transmission for about<br />\n95% of the electrical systems now in use has been<br />\nits great economy, as compared to other systems,<br />\nin the transmission of power. And the transformer, itself, is the heart of the alternating<br />\ncurrent system.<br />\nIt permits a small current, at high voltage, to<br />\nbe transformed to a large current at low voltage,<br />\nor vice versa,through the use of simple,immobile<br />\napparatus, and thus supplies the essential factor<br />\nin electrical transmission.<br />\nWilliam Stanley is remembered because it was<br />\nhe who commercially developed transformers of<br />\nhigh efficiency and satisfactory regulating qualities. He brought out the first system in which<br />\nthe transformers were connected in parallel,<br />\nacross a constant-potential system, instead of<br />\nthe series operation used by Gaulard and Gibbs.<br />\nThe system embodying this principle was put<br />\ninto operation at Great Barrington, Mass., on<br />\nMarch 16, 1886, and has been the standard<br />\nmethod ever since.<br />\nThus briefly is recorded the history of another contribution of the Westinghouse engineering organization to the electrical art; since<br />\nall the transformers which are made today are<br />\nbuilt upon the same general principles as those<br />\nfirst constructed to embody William Stanley's<br />\ninventions.<br /><br />"}], "field_media_file": [{"target_id": 37607, "display": null, "description": null, "target_type": "file", "target_uuid": "704cbf8e-82e9-42d6-a03d-b3f568c0a1a7", "url": "http://digital.library.jhu.edu/system/files/2022-03/12993-Extracted%20Text.txt"}], "field_media_of": [{"target_id": 12993, "target_type": "node", "target_uuid": "6bd7c7ae-a403-45d8-9f9c-a9299dcb363c", "url": "/node/12993"}], "field_media_use": [{"target_id": 15, "target_type": "taxonomy_term", "target_uuid": "c6a3a700-c007-4c4f-b77a-403d89b54878", "url": "/taxonomy/term/15"}], "field_mime_type": [{"value": "text/plain"}], "field_restricted_access": [], "field_unique_id": [{"value": "f562a67a-8ab1-4e7e-85fe-4b0cdb3577e8"}]}
