The N.C.A. does no<br />\naccrediting itself, but seeks rather<br />\nto correct the abuses of the system and to invent new methods<br />\nand establish general standards for<br />\nthe various accrediting agencies.<br />\nThe National Commission itself<br />\nIs composed of five national associations such as the Association<br />\nof Land Grant Colleges and Universities and the Association of<br />\nUrban Universities as constituant<br />\nmembers, and the institutions<br />\nwithin these associations as institutional<br />\nmembers.<br />\nIt<br />\nworks<br />\nthrough six regional accrediting<br /><br />\nBridge<br />\nBy MAC MACARTY<br />\nNorth dealer, East-West vulnerable.<br />\nNORTH<br />\nS 8 5<br />\nH K 8<br />\nD Q 7 3<br />\nC K Q 9 7 4 2<br />\nWEST<br />\nEAST<br />\nS A 7 4<br />\nS K Q 3<br />\n11 J 7 6 2<br />\nH A Q 10 9 5<br />\nDAKJ5<br />\nD 8 4 2<br />\nC 10 3<br />\nC A 6<br />\nSOUTH<br />\nS J 10 9 6 2<br />\n1143<br />\nD 10 9 6<br />\nCJ 85<br />\nThe bidding:<br />\nWest<br />\nNorth<br />\nSouth<br />\nEast<br /><br />\n4<br /><br />\n\u2022<br /><br />\n3C<br />\nPass<br />\nPass<br /><br />\n\u2022\u2022<br /><br />\n\u2022<br /><br />\n\u2022<br /><br />\n3H<br />\n5H<br />\nPass<br /><br />\nPass<br />\nPass<br />\nPass<br /><br />\n4NT<br />\n611<br /><br />\nNorth's opening bid against vulnerable opponents was quite standard while East's overcall in a major<br />\nsuit by previous agreement is a<br />\nfairly strong bid.

Turntable records are put<br />\nout by the destributors of the<br />\nJump label, and both are to be<br />\nrecommended.
