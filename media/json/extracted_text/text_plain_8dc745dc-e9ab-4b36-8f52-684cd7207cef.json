Social Director Pat Cichon, however, argued that this action would<br />\nseverely hamper the Social<br />\nCommittee for the rest of the<br />\nyear. He proposed, therefore,<br />\nthat only one quarter, or<br />\n$617.29, of the total be paid by<br />\nthe Social Committee, with an<br />\nequal amount coming from the<br />\nStudent Council Contingency<br />\nFund.

The task of the committee is to<br />\nestablish the most important non-academic<br />\nneeds of students over the next twenty years.<br />\nThe report generated by this Student Life<br />\nPlanning Committee will be used as a fundraising document in the upcoming Capital<br />\nCampaign. Although the administrators and<br />\nstudents on the committee only have a few<br />\nweeks in which to draw up a rough draft of<br />\nthis report, the subject is one of such vital<br />\nimportance that it demands undivided attention and thought.<br />\nIt is essential that the committee approach<br />\nthis task in a comprehensive and coordinated<br />\nmanner. Merely producing a shopping list<br />\nof buildings and programs that students<br />\nwould like to see would be ineffectual.<br />\nSpecific goals must be defined and suggestions for change must be geared towards<br />\nfulfilling these goals.<br />\nThe first necessary step is to identify the<br />\nmajor problems of student life at Hopkins.<br />\nTwo obvious ones stand out: the lack of a<br />\ncollegiate atmosphere and an apathetic attitude towards extracurricular activities. A<br />\nthird problem, probably of less concern to<br />\nmost undergraduates but nevertheless important, is the isolation of Hopkins students<br />\nfrom the cultural and social activities of<br />\nBaltimore. While these problems may be<br />\neasy to identify, they are difficult to solve.<br />\nAdvocating major changes necessarily involves guesswork about future student attitudes and uncontrollable external circumstances. However, there are some areas<br />\nin which changes are appropriate and would<br />\nadd to the quality of student life.<br />\nPerhaps the most vital aspect of the student environment demanding attention is<br />\nhousing. Every student requires living space,<br />\ntherefore the housing issue affects all undergraduates. In the first place, the quality of<br />\naccommodations must be upgraded. The<br />\npresent construction of new dormitories and<br />\nthe proposed renovation of existing dorms<br />\nwill contribute much to this end. However,<br />\noff-campus University-owned housing is in<br />\ndire need of rehabilitation, as plumbing,<br />\nelectrical service and appearance are rapidly dilapidating. In addition, it may be<br />\nnecessary over the next twenty years, to construct even more dormitories on campus. Efforts to place more students on the Homewood campus full time would certainly<br />\nfacilitate a more cohesive social atmosphere.<br />\nThe scattering of undergraduates throughout<br />\nthe Charles Village community is one of the<br />\nmain culprits of a dismal collegiate climate.<br />\nWhile additional on-campus housing facilities<br />\nwill be helpful, it is essential to maintain a<br />\nhigh standard of accommodation in order<br />\nto ensure that students chose to live on campus rather than in the community.<br />\nAlso central to the improvement of the<br />\nHopkins social scene is the establishment of<br />\na legitimate student union. Levering Hall is<br />\ninadequate because its facilities are shared<br />\nwith non-student concerns. At this point it<br />\nremains unknown whether the common<br />\nspace in the old dormitories will fulfill this<br />\nfunction. An ideal student union should contain a recreational room, a lounge, conference rooms and a theater. Many problems<br />\nexist with Shriver Hall and the Listening/Viewing room. Neither has enough<br />\nroom for building sets, and while Shriver<br />\ndoes have satisfactory backstage facilities,<br />\n<br />\nthe size of the hall is impractical for many<br />\nstudent productions. In order to substantially contribute to a healthy collegiate atmosphere, a student union should also contain a pub, coffee house and snack bar.<br />\nIdeally it should have a dining facility as<br />\nwell. It is appalling that there is only one<br />\nplace on campus where students can eat with<br />\na meal card. The institution of a meal plan<br />\nwith just five meals a week and an additional<br />\neating facility would be convenient and<br />\nuseful.<br />\nMuch of the student apathy at Hopkins<br />\ncan be attributed to a tough, competitive<br />\nacademic environment. However, there is<br />\nalso the possibility that more modern<br />\nfacilities would attract students to extracurricular pursuits. Improvement of some of the<br />\nathletic fields may encourage interest in intramural sports, a new theater may spur students to become involved in drama, and a<br />\nmodernized band room may generate more<br />\nmusical extracurricular activity. The<br />\nfeasibility of solutions to these problems,<br />\nhowever, must be analyzed carefully.<br />\nBuilding new facilities left and right, for example, would be a mistake because the student body at Hopkins is small and would not<br />\nbe able to sustain a large number of additions. Careful improvements, however,<br />\nwould certainly be welcomed by the student<br />\nbody.<br />\nEven with the creation of new and modernized facilities geared towards extracurricular concerns, Hopkins will remain unable<br />\nto fulfill all of the social desires of students.<br />\nThe city of Baltimore, however, has many<br />\ncultural and social activities to offer of which<br />\nmany Hopkins students fail to take advantage. The University should make a concerted effort to eliminate the barrier between<br />\nHomewood and Baltimore. Students should<br />\ncontinuously be provided with information<br />\nabout events occurring in the city, and even<br />\nmore importantly, students should be<br />\ngranted access to these activities. Few<br />\nHopkins students have cars, making<br />\ntransportation somewhat of a problem,<br />\nespecially at night. It might be a good idea<br />\nto provide a shuttle service, leaving<br />\nHomewood throughout the day and night,<br />\nmaking stops at various museums, the Inner Harbor, Fells Point, and other points of<br />\ninterest. Furthermore, the University should<br />\nactively encourage participation in community events by acquiring discount student<br />\ntickets to plays and concert.<br />\nWhatever suggestions the committee eventually decides to incorporate into its report,<br />\nthe most important thing is that they reflect<br />\na coherent philosophy of student needs.<br />\nClear directions need to be established; a<br />\nhaphazard list of student concerns must be<br />\navoided at all costs. Priorities must be set.<br />\nIt is unfortunate that the committee has<br />\nso little time in which to work. Time constraints will make input from the general student body that much more difficult. Yet, it<br />\nis important that attempts are made to ascertain students' views. One way to do this is<br />\nthrough the News-Letter. All students should<br />\nthink seriously about this subject and send<br />\ntheir thoughts to the editor next week. A<br />\nhealthy response would mean a lot to the<br />\ncommittee and to the future of Johns<br />\nHopkins. Time is short but the development<br />\nof a coordinated and sensible document<br />\noutlining student non-academic needs over<br />\nthe next twenty years is not an impossibility.<br />\n<br />\nLetters<br />\nDraft Registration: Something To Think About<br />\nTo the Editor:<br />\nI want to share some thoughts<br />\nwith you.<br />\nI recently received a letter<br />\nfrom the Selective Service. It informed me that I have been<br />\nnegligent in my duty to register<br />\nfor military service, and requested that I do so now. I expect that a number of other<br />\nmen in this area received similar<br />\nletters, and that many will have<br />\nresponded already. That does<br />\nnot make this letter obsolete.<br />\nThe questions I raise here will<br />\nremain vital as long as registration remains in effect and there<br />\nis the possibility of a draft. Furthermore, these thoughts are<br />\nnot meant only for the young<br />\nmen who still face this question.<br />\nI direct them also to the women, to the older members of<br />\nthe community and to those<br />\n\"ho have already made a decision.<br />\nAs I face this dilemma at this<br />\ntime there are clearly two fundamental possibilities: registration and non-registration. The<br />\nlatter could potentially result in<br />\nbeing asked to fight and to die<br />\nfor reasons with which I do not<br />\nagree. Obviously, neither of<br />\nthese outcomes is inevitable. It<br />\nis precisely for that reason that<br />\nI am writing, because we can<br />\ncontrol these outcomes only to<br />\nthe extent that we actively<br />\nprepare for the future. Before<br />\nI embark on any course, I feel<br />\nI need to come to terms with<br />\nwhat it could mean.<br />\nYou do, too.<br />\nHave you registered? What<br />\nwere your reasons? Are those<br />\nreasons still appropriate?<br />\nIs military service your<br />\nobligation to this country?<br />\n<br />\nWould you die for this country? In which situation?<br />\nWould you kill for this country? Can this country ask that<br />\nof you?<br />\nDo you believe that our<br />\nleaders will respect these<br />\nfeelings?<br />\nThere may be some who feel<br />\nI exaggerate by taking registration to imply a draft and even<br />\nwar. I am unable to do otherwise. Speaking of registration \u2022<br />\nwithout thinking of a draft<br />\nseems to me like speaking of intercourse without considering<br />\npregnancy. If we are ready to<br />\naccept that possibility, then we<br />\nneed only watch and wait. If<br />\nnot, however, then we owe it to<br />\nourselves to act.<br />\nYou have no obligation to<br />\nreach the same conclusions as<br />\nI do. Nor are you obligated to<br />\ntake the time to think about the<br />\nquestions I have posed. Remember, though, that when the<br />\ntime comes you may not be<br />\ngiven much of a chance to do<br />\nso. No one needs to be alone<br />\nwith this issue. Both the Chaplain's Office on campus and the<br />\nAmerican Friends Service Committee offer non-directed draft<br />\ncounseling. Do not hesitate to<br />\ncontact them with your questions.<br />\nMy purpose in writing is to<br />\nspur thought and discussion<br />\nand, I hope, action. There is<br />\nmuch that we can do for ourselves and for each other.<br />\nPlease do not let yourself believe that this does not touch<br />\nyou.

The<br />\nAcademic Council decided instead to rely only on good faith<br />\nefforts from each department.<br />\nThe Academic Council's<br />\ndecision grew from a simple<br />\ndilemma.

This letter implied that<br />\nthere was no difference between<br />\nnative and foreign TAs, and<br />\nthat problems with foreign TAs<br />\nwere based on student impressions rather than on reality.<br />\nOne of the letter's signers later<br />\nsaid the problem was one of accents, not vocabulary or grammer: \"There aren't any<br />\ngraduate students [in the<br />\nPhysics Department] who can't<br />\nspeak English.\"<br />\nThat's not what the<br />\nundergraduates say.

Dr. Anfinsen, who is a<br />\nNobel laureate in chemistry and<br />\nalso holds a joint appointment<br />\nin the Biology Department,<br />\nsays his job is \"to find sources<br />\nof support for research, to<br />\nfigure out ways of exchanging<br />\ninformation throughout the<br />\nUniversity of opportunities for<br />\nfunds, and to keep everyone informed as to what is going on<br />\nin the administration and various divisions in terms of<br />\nincome.\"<br />\nThere are similar offices in<br />\nother Hopkins institutions. Mr.<br />\nJohn Kudless says his job as<br />\ndirector of the Office of Development at the School of Hygiene is \"to identify private-<br />\n<br />\nsector funding for SHPH<br />\nprograms.\"<br />\nIndustry supports basic research by giving gifts to universities, supporting specific research programs by grants and<br />\nby financing joint universityindustry institutes. The most<br />\nprevalent at Hopkins are industry grants for specific projects, particularly at the medical<br />\ninstitutions where developments are more likely to be<br />\nmarketable. For example, the<br />\nCosmetics Association is funding basic research to develop effective in vitro toxicology tests<br />\nwhich would replace animal<br />\ntesting and ultimately make it<br />\ncheaper to test the safety of new<br />\nproducts.<br />\nAccording to Mr. Kudless,<br />\nmost industry grants are similar, \"Industry is only willing to<br />\nfund basic research if there is a<br />\nrelevance to application somewhere down the-road.\" Biotechnology, especially recombinant DNA work, dominates the university-industry<br />\nventures, but agreements have<br />\nalso been made in fields such as<br />\nmicro-electronics, polymers<br />\nand robotics. The way most of<br />\n<br />\nthese are arranged is for the<br />\nuniversity to retain any patent<br />\nrights, and the industry, in exchange for funding, to receive<br />\nexclusive rights to licensing of<br />\nany developments.<br />\nThe five year-2.5 million dollar agreement between Hopkins<br />\nand American Cyanamid to<br />\nstudy allergies and lung disorders is typical in size of most<br />\ncontracts, although they can be<br />\nas large as Monsanto's five<br />\nyear-23.5 million dollar funding<br />\nof protein and peptide research<br />\nat Washington University in St.<br />\nLouis.<br />\nThis type of funding, however, does have risks. Dr. Anfinsen says, \"We are worried<br />\nabout the impact on the attitude of research people, particularly the young guys who<br />\nmay tend to tailor their research<br />\nor the selection of projects<br />\nalong the lines that it may make<br />\na lot of money instead of<br />\nsomething which is very important fundamentally. That should<br />\nbe avoided at all costs.\"<br />\nDr. Tim Duelfer, a postdoctoral researcher at the School of<br />\nHygiene, cautions, \"Industry<br />\nfunding is good in that it takes<br />\na lot of the financial burden off<br />\nof the universities. The threat is<br />\nthat industry may exert control<br />\nover what is being done, which<br />\ncould lead to a lot of bad<br />\nresearch. I don't think Hopkins<br />\nwould want to be known for<br />\ndeveloping an improved catsup<br />\nthickener.\"<br />\nIn response to the increased<br />\ninteraction between academe<br />\nand industry, a national conference on university-corporate<br />\nrelations in science and technology was held last December<br />\n14, 15 and 16 in Philadelphia,<br />\n<br />\nIs Sex An Issue For You?<br />\nIt Is For Zeniada<br />\nAnd We Need Your Help<br />\nwriterseditorsartistspoetsproofreaders<br />\nadsellersbusinesspeoplephotographers<br />\ndesignersproductionassistantsresearchers<br />\n<br />\nCome To Our First Meeting!<br />\nCurrent Staff Expected<br />\nNew Members Welcome<br />\n<br />\nSunday, February 6, 3 p.m.<br />\nThe Little Theatre<br />\n(Chester's Place)<br />\n<br />\nhosted by eight universities, ineluding Hopkins.<br />\nIn his welcoming remarks,<br />\nSheldon Hackney, president of<br />\nthe University of Pennsylvania,<br />\nsaid,\"At this conference we intend to come to grips with the<br />\nopportunities and challenges, as<br />\nwell as the risks, of research<br />\npartnerships between industry<br />\nand academe in full view of<br />\npublic interest groups and<br />\nmedia. We must acknowledge<br />\nthe distance that divides [business and academe, including]<br />\nquestions of proprietary knowledge, and academic freedom<br />\nand the free flow of information\u2014the tensions between<br />\nbasic and applied research. We<br />\nmust find satisfactory solutions<br />\nto bridge those distances.\"<br />\nThe conference, entitled<br />\n\"Partners in the Research<br />\nEnterprise,\" was funded by the`<br />\nSmithkline Beckman Corporalion and attended by university presidents, senior corporate<br />\nofficers, government officials,<br />\nrepresentatives of the professional scientific societies, trade<br />\nassociations, public interest<br />\ngroups and the news media.<br />\n<br />\nAlthough the conference did<br />\nnot provide any solutions, it did<br />\nopen communication between-<br />\n<br />\nChristian Anfinsen<br />\n<br />\nsenior officials of government,<br />\nindustry and academe through<br />\nwhich future problems may be<br />\nsatisfactorily solved.<br />\nIt is felt that the amount of<br />\nfunding industry may eventually grant for basic research will<br />\nnot be significant compared to<br />\npublic support and will not<br />\nreplace government cuts. Dr.<br />\nHackney stated, \"Both universities and corporations recognize the need for the federal<br />\ngovernment to maintain its<br />\nlong-standing commitment to<br />\nbasic research.\"<br />\n<br />\nDitto Government<br />\nThe majority of funding for<br />\nbasic scientific research done in<br />\nthe U.S. comes from the federal<br />\nand state governments. Most of<br />\nthe state money supports state<br />\nuniversities and research on the<br />\nlocal level. Due to the federal<br />\nbudget cuts of the current administration, funding for basic<br />\nresearch, and education in gen-.<br />\neral, is becoming more difficult<br />\nto obtain. According to Dr.<br />\nTerence Risby, an associate<br />\nprofessor at the School of<br />\nHygiene, \"The effects [of the<br />\ncuts] have been felt in the last<br />\nsix months and have been devastating. Some research programs have been cut out cornpletely.\"<br />\nIn the January 3 issue of The<br />\nChemical & Engineering News,<br />\nthe fiscal 1983 research and\u2022<br />\ndevelopment budgets of the<br />\nmajor federal angencies as<br />\npassed by Congress were listed.<br />\nCongress funded all but the<br />\nDepartment of Defense at a<br />\nhigher level than requested by<br />\nPresident Reagan. The percentage of change from the 1982<br />\nfigures in each agency are as<br />\nfollows: Dept. of Defense,+14<br />\npercent; National Air and<br />\nSpace Administration;+17 percent; National Institutes of<br />\nHealth,+10 percent; Dept. of<br />\nEnergy, \u20145 percent; National<br />\nScience Foundation,+ 10 percent; Dept. of. Agriculture,+6<br />\npercent; Dept. of Commerce,-5<br />\npercent; and the Environmental Protection Agency,-723 percent. These agencies support<br />\nresearch with private companies<br />\nand by financing their own<br />\nresearch laboratories,<br />\nA researcher obtains a grant<br />\nby sending his proposal to an<br />\nappropriate angency. If the<br />\nproposal is approved, the grant<br />\n<br />\nmoney is forwarded to the<br />\nuniversity, which keeps a portion for overhead, and the remainder is given to the research<br />\ner, who uses it to finance his<br />\nlaboratory. Unfortunately, the<br />\nawarding of grants can be unfair; new or esoterical areas of<br />\nresearch are often underfunded. Also, the drafting of proposals is too time consuming,<br />\ntime which researchers feel is<br />\nwasted.<br />\nIn government contracted laboratories, an agency appropriates a certain amount of money<br />\nfor the facility to perform<br />\nresearch. The Commerce Department supports research<br />\nfacilities at the National Bureau<br />\nof Standards. The scientists do<br />\nnot have to submit proposals;<br />\nthey are allocated a fixed sum<br />\nof money to conduct their<br />\nresearch.<br />\nWith the current economic<br />\nsituation, funding for science is expected to decrease, since support for education and research<br />\nhas always been the first cut<br />\nduring hard times. Says Dr.<br />\nRisby, \"Graduate and postdoctoral support and the number<br />\nof junior faculty members will<br />\nbe hurt the most. This is very<br />\nbad for education, since these<br />\nare the educators of the fu<br />\nture. . .It will also affect the<br />\ntotal number of research programs going on, and will make<br />\nit difficult for the U.S. to maintam n superiority in the basic<br />\nsciences.\"<br />\nThe consequences of prolonged reduction in basic research will be felt in the future,<br />\nwhen the absence of new technology and inventions allows<br />\nother developed countries to<br />\nsurpass the U.S. scientifically<br />\nand economically.<br />\n<br />\n\fNEWS-LETTER/PAGE 9,<br />\n<br />\nHalls Of Fame<br />\n<br />\nRowland:A Student But Not A Park<br />\nBY PAUL G. BRUNETTA<br />\nBorn on November 26, 1848,<br />\nHenry Rowland expressed an<br />\ninterest in physics during the<br />\nearly stages of his development.<br />\nAt three years of age, he made<br />\na model of a clock from a cardboard box. At fourteen, he experimented with the new ideas<br />\nof electricity and magnetism.<br />\nRowland constructed his own<br />\nLeyden jars to supply an electrical current to his experiments. He used layers of paper<br />\nto insulate the wires, but this<br />\napproach was later patented by<br />\nsomeone else. At seventeen, he<br />\nmanufactured a furnace which<br />\nmelted iron so he could make<br />\nhis own castings for experimental equipment. Perhaps his<br />\nmost calamitous experiment<br />\nwas when he created a hot air<br />\nballoon from newspapers and<br />\nsailed it over his neighborhood.<br />\nThe invention burst into flames,<br />\ndescended onto a nearby roof<br />\nand precipitated the speedy arrival of the local fire department.<br />\nHenry Rowland's father,<br />\ngrandfather and great-grandfather were Presbyterian ministers, and it was expected that<br />\nhe, too, would join the ministry.<br />\nHis father's death in 1849 left<br />\nHarriette Rowland in custody<br />\nof her son, and she packed him<br />\noff to the Newark Academy in<br />\nNew Jersey when he was fourteen. Rowland spent three<br />\nseemingly worthless years studying Greek and Latin, and<br />\nthen transferred to the Phillips<br />\nAcademy in Andover.<br />\nBut he hated Phillips. The<br />\nprincipal once commented that<br />\nRowland had \"gained nothing<br />\nfrom the school.\" His secondary education, however, was<br />\nmonotonous enough to bore<br />\nany student. His first semester<br />\noffered Latin lessons, Latin<br />\ngrammar and Latin reading;<br />\nthe second term enforced Latin<br />\nreading, Latin grammar and<br />\nLatin prose composition; and<br />\nthe third term consisted of<br />\nLatin grammar, Roman history<br />\nin Latin, ancient history and<br />\narithmetic.<br />\nRowland's next move was to<br />\nthe Renssalaer Polytechnic Institute in Troy, New York. This<br />\nuniversity provided him with a<br />\nwelcome change from the classics and offered a strong program in Newtonian mechanics<br />\nand calculus. His interests in<br />\nelectricity and magnetism,<br />\nhowever, had to be pursued on<br />\nhis own time<br />\nRowland-spent several months<br />\nof his junior year at the Sheffield Scientific School at Yale,<br />\nand then returned to R.P.I. to<br />\ncomplete his degree in civil<br />\nengineering. From his memoirs,<br />\nit is apparent that Michael<br />\nFaraday had a tremendous influence on his life, and he kept<br />\nbound dairies of experiments<br />\nand notes on electricity and<br />\nmagnetism. Faraday's \"Experimental Researches in Electricity\" was his bible, and he<br />\npondered the difficulties of<br />\nmeasuring magnetic permeability and the magnetic effect of a<br />\nmoving body carrying an electrostatic charge.<br />\n<br />\nRowland received his degree<br />\nfrom R.P.I. in 1870 and became a surveyor for the Western New York Railroad for a<br />\nyear. He was then appointed<br />\nassistant professor of natural<br />\nscience at Wooster University in<br />\nOhio, and returned to R.P.I. a<br />\nyear later to teach electrodynamics. His students rated<br />\nhis course in the subject \"the<br />\nhardest in the institute\" and<br />\nconsidered him \"the smartest<br />\nman on the faculty.\" About his<br />\nteaching ability, they commented that he could not \"im-<br />\n<br />\nRowland secured a position<br />\nin the laboratory of Hermann<br />\nvon Helmholtz during his year<br />\nabroad before the opening of<br />\nHopkins in 1876. In Berlin, he<br />\ndecided to test one of Faraday's<br />\nunproven hypotheses on convection currents. Faraday had<br />\nspeculated that \"if a ball be<br />\nelectrified in the middle of a<br />\nroom and then be moved in any<br />\ndirection, effects will be produced as if a current in the same<br />\ndirection had existed.\"<br />\nHelmholtz had failed to detect<br />\nthese magnetic effects, but<br />\n<br />\nRowland Hall<br />\n<br />\npart knowledge to others...No<br />\none can excel him in blind<br />\nquestions, and his explanations<br />\nare useful only to himself.\"<br />\nRowland was obviously more<br />\ninterested in his own research<br />\nendeavors than in his students,<br />\nbut he was a teacher by example and always provided his<br />\nstudents with the first reports<br />\non his research.<br />\nAs a professor at Renssalaer,<br />\nhe was interested in Faraday's<br />\nobservation of the resemblance<br />\nbetween the electric field and<br />\nthe magnetic field. Rowland<br />\nconstructed a special galvanometer and carefully graphed the<br />\nmagnetic field around cores of<br />\nvarious materials excited by<br />\nelectrical currents of different<br />\nstrengths. His experimental<br />\nresults illustrated that the<br />\nstrength of the magnetic field<br />\nvaries in proportion to the<br />\nresistance of permeability of the<br />\nmaterial. These findings in magnetic permeability complemented Ohm's law of electrical resistance.<br />\n<br />\nDaniel Colt Gilman resigned<br />\nas president of the University of<br />\nCalifornia to organize the<br />\nJohns Hopkins Universitiy, his<br />\nconcept of the ultimate scientific institution. Gilman was<br />\nvisiting West Point's Military<br />\nAcademy in 1875 and met<br />\nRowland in Troy to interview<br />\nhim for a teaching position.<br />\nMaxwell's letters were excellent<br />\nrecommendations, and Gilman<br />\nhired the young man to organize the physics department at<br />\nHopkins. Classes were not<br />\nscheduled to begin until 1876,<br />\nhowever, and Gilman proposed that Rowland travel around<br />\nEurope and establish ties with<br />\nprominent physicists. He was<br />\nreceived warmly by Maxwell at<br />\nCambridge and brought considerable attention to Hopkins<br />\nupon his return in 1876. He<br />\ncontinued to teach and conduct<br />\nresearch until his death in 1901.<br />\n<br />\nRowland succeeded by adding<br />\na structure to the design of the<br />\napparatus which amplified the<br />\nweak charge produced. His results were accurate enough to<br />\ntest the ratio of the electrostatic<br />\n<br />\nforce to the electromagnetic<br />\nforce.<br />\nRowland was 27 when he was<br />\ninvited to join the founding<br />\nfaculty of Johns Hopkins University, and he lived up to<br />\nGilman's notion of the physicist<br />\nand teacher Hopkins needed.<br />\nRowland was instructed by Gilman and by the Hopkins Trustees to inspect various university physics labs during his<br />\nEuropean tour of 1875-76.<br />\nRowland compiled a list of instruments which were necessary<br />\nfor his lab, and they were purchased for approximately<br />\n56500.

Soon, the<br />\nHopkins lab was recognized by<br />\nHarvard colleagues, and described as \"far superior in all<br />\nrespects to that owned by any<br />\nAmerican university, and indeed, in the subject of electricity, larger and better than any<br />\nuniversity in Europe has in its<br />\npossession.\"<br />\nRowland's first experiment<br />\nat Hopkins involved the mechanical equivalent of heat.

He once commented that<br />\nhe had never seen a machine<br />\nwhose function he could not<br />\nimmediately comprehend.<br />\nConcerning his teaching<br />\nability at Hopkins, Rowland<br />\nwas once asked what he intended to do with his students. He<br />\nstated, \"Do with them? Do<br />\nwith them? Why, I shall neglect<br />\nthem, of course!\" Along the<br />\nsame lines, one of his students<br />\ncommented that \"To be neglected by Rowland...was more<br />\nstimulating and inspiring than<br />\nthe closest personal supervision<br />\nof lesser men.\"<br />\n<br />\nSymp Poses Simple Energy Question<br />\nBY ANDREW HURLEY<br />\nFour experts in their respective fields, a geophysicist, an<br />\neconomist, a lawyer and a<br />\nscientific journalist, were posed the question, \"Has the<br />\nenergy shortage passed?\" at an<br />\nenergy symposium held at<br />\nHomewood on January 10 and<br />\n11. Four very different answers<br />\nmerged.<br />\nGeophysicist S. Fred Singer<br />\nbegan the discussion by asserting that while many energy problems persist, much of the talk<br />\nabout an energy crisis is overstated. Singer argued that<br />\nthreats of foreign embargoes<br />\nare ineffectual because they<br />\n\"hardly ever work.\" He also<br />\nminimized the power of OPEC<br />\nby pointing out that rather than<br />\nsetting the price of oil, they<br />\nmerely ratify the price established by the international free<br />\nmarket.<br />\nYet, even allowing for continued price hikes, Singer maintained that substitution of<br />\ncheaper fuels would mitigate<br />\nany hardship. \"Nearly twothirds of the world's oil can be<br />\nreplaced by other sources which<br />\nare becoming cheaper,\" he<br />\nnoted.<br />\nAccording to Singer, the sudden tripling of petroleum prices<br />\nduring 1979-80 killed off a large<br />\nportion of the oil market. For<br />\nheat and steam production, it is<br />\nnow more economical to use<br />\nnatural gas, coal or nuclear<br />\nenergy, which he says is very<br />\ncheap to produce once construction costs are out of the<br />\nway. Singer believes future oil<br />\nddemand may decrease as auto-<br />\n<br />\nmobile efficiency increases and<br />\nas natural gas, alcohol and<br />\nmethanol become feasible trans<br />\nportation fuels. New technologies may also serve to lower<br />\nthe cost of alternate fuels, such<br />\nas coal. Singer even went as far<br />\nas to predict in the discussion<br />\ndraft he submitted that more<br />\nthan half of the world's oil<br />\nresources will remain underground.<br />\nPhilip Abelson, editor of<br />\nScience Magazine, also offered<br />\nhis projections on the domestic<br />\nenergy outlook. While Abelson<br />\npredicted that over the next<br />\nthree years oil prices would<br />\ndecline, the long-term trend will<br />\nbe upward.<br />\nEnergy economist Hans<br />\nLandsberg, however, presented<br />\na much gloomier forecast.<br />\nLandsburg expressed particular<br />\nconcern about the period between five and twenty years<br />\nfrom now. During these years,<br />\nas oil and gas supplies continue<br />\nto deplete and the expense of<br />\nextraction rises, a transformation of the nation's energy consumption patterns will become<br />\nnecessary. Yet, he fears that<br />\nsuch a transition will be<br />\ndifficult.<br />\nLandsberg's worries stem<br />\nfrom the federal government's<br />\nrecent withdrawal of funds for<br />\nresearch and development,<br />\nwhich he believes will not be<br />\npicked up by the private sector,<br />\nthe lengthy lead times generally associated with supply projects, the environmental problems associated with coal and<br />\nnuclear energy production, and<br />\nthe absence of a feasible oil<br />\n:substitute for transportation<br />\n<br />\nfuel.<br />\nJust as the panelists offered<br />\ndissimilar forecasts, they presented different explanations<br />\nfor past energy problems.<br />\nSinger, who currently works at<br />\nthe Heritage Foundation, placed the blame for previous<br />\nenergy crises squarely on the<br />\nshoulders of the federal government. Meddling in the marketplace only served to make<br />\nthings worse, he argued. \"For<br />\nexample,\" Singer wrote of the<br />\n1979 shortage in his discussion<br />\ndraft,\"in Maryland, the data<br />\nshowed much gasoline being used in beach resorts during the<br />\nsummer, and that's how the<br />\ngovernment allocated the gasoline. But,\" he added, \"drivers<br />\nwere afraid of leaving the city<br />\nfor fear of not being able to<br />\nfind gasoline for their return<br />\njourney.\" It was therefore, said<br />\nSinger, \"the misguided allocation efforts...that caused the<br />\ngasoline lines.\"<br />\nSinger's assessment of the<br />\nproper role of government was<br />\nattacked by Landsberg, who<br />\nargued that steps need to be<br />\ntaken to reduce inequities that<br />\nenergy shortages exacerbate.<br />\nThe seminar's final speaker<br />\nwas Stuart Eizenstat, a former<br />\n:White House advisor during the<br />\nCarter administration. His presentation focused on government's inability to develop a<br />\nconsistent and coordinated<br />\nenergy program.<br />\nThe two-day conference,<br />\nwhich focused on energy challenges for the Middle Atlantic<br />\nstates, was sponsored by the<br />\nEnergy Research Institute, bass ed at Hopkins.<br />\n<br />\n\fTrue TV Confessions<br />\n<br />\nLondon<br />\nBY HARRIS B. LEVITON<br />\n<br />\nBY BETH POLASKY<br />\nMy brother was a whiz kid. My sister<br />\nwas a cute kid. I was a TV kid, and I<br />\nstill am. It's an awful thing to admit,<br />\nespecially in a campus newspaper. My<br />\nclose friends have warned me not to go<br />\npublic. I know Hopkins' reputation is<br />\nat stake. I've already received a few<br />\n\"friendly\" warnings from the administration, \"Beth, don't do it. Our reputation is at stake.\" They're probably<br />\nafraid some other television addicts will<br />\nread this and want to apply here. I hope<br />\nthat won't happen. Hopkins is no place<br />\nfor a TV kid. I know.<br />\nMy parents will probably be embarrassed by this, and feel guilty, too. They<br />\nshould.<br />\nMy parents had a hard time getting a<br />\npermanent babysitter for me. Seems I<br />\nalways bit them. Once, when I was two,<br />\n1 bit the sitter so hard she<br />\ndumped me in my playpen and<br />\nleft. She did<br />\nleave a note<br />\nsaying, \"Your<br />\nkid's a brat.<br />\nWho needs the<br />\n$3.75 anyway?\"<br />\nMy parents<br />\ncame<br />\nhome to<br />\nfind me<br />\n<br />\nthoroughly engrossed in<br />\nThe Patty Duke Show.<br />\nThey were mad at the babysitter, but<br />\nglad that they had finally found a cheap<br />\nway to keep me entertained when they<br />\nwent out. They would just put me in my<br />\nplaypen, place a few clean diapers and<br />\na bottle of juice in a corner, and say,<br />\n\"Have fun, kid.\" I didn't mind. I learned how to change my own diapers by<br />\nwatching Pampers commercials.<br />\nThe folks were thrilled. So thrilled, in<br />\nfact, that they gave me a remote control<br />\ncolor TV for my third birthday. I<br />\nbecame the world's youngest computer<br />\nbrat, switching from Gilligan 'S Island to<br />\nThe Galloping Gourmet with a flip of<br />\nmy tiny wrist. By the time I was four,<br />\nI knew perfect English (and even spoke<br />\na little Italian, thanks to PBS). So what<br />\nif I didn't have any friends? I was<br />\ncultured\u2014opera, symphony, Henry the<br />\nVIII\u2014you name it, I watched it.<br />\nElementary and junior high school<br />\nwere a breeze. I patterned my life after<br />\nJan Brady, Laurie Partridge and Marcia Brady, in that order. By my junior<br />\nyear of high school, I was the three most<br />\npopular girls in Cincinnati.<br />\nI had an interesting \"getting to know<br />\nyou\" appointment with my college<br />\nguidance counselor, Ms. Turner. I told<br />\nher I was interested in Hopkins, Harvard, Princeton and Yale. She asked my<br />\ncareer goals. I said, \"assistant producer<br />\nof WJM News in Minneapolis.\" Ms.<br />\nTurner asked, \"Why don't you shoot<br />\nfor the top? Why can't you be producer?\" I was astonished. \"But that's<br />\nMr. Grant's job!\" She suggested I go to<br />\nHopkins.<br />\nI skipped my freshman year here\u2014<br />\nnot enough privacy in the dorms. Peo-<br />\n<br />\nple would laugh if they found out what<br />\na TV kid I really was. They'd kick me<br />\nout of school. I deferred my admission<br />\nand went to a community college in Cincinnati for a year. I lived at home,<br />\nwatched TV, and got straight A's. I<br />\ncame to Hopkins as a transfer sophomore.<br />\nI moved into Wolman Hall, anxious<br />\nto begin apartment living. I was a bit<br />\nworried about my new housemates\u2014I<br />\ndidn't know how they would react to my<br />\nbeing a TV kid and all. I devised a plan.<br />\nI couldn't let them know that I had a<br />\ntelevision in my room, so I put one TV<br />\nin the living room. They were kind of<br />\nshocked at first. When they asked why<br />\non earth I had brought a television to<br />\nHopkins, I casually<br />\n<br />\nsaid, \"Oh that? I don't watch it<br />\nmuch\u2014just the news, Masterpiece<br />\nTheater, maybe a few Dance In<br />\nAmerica's now and then.\" And it worked! They just shrugged their shoulders<br />\nand went back to ignoring me. They<br />\naren't too bright.<br />\nThen\u2014here comes the tricky part-1<br />\nhide my second television in my bedroom, under the bed. After class (and<br />\noften before), I come home and bolt my<br />\nbedroom door. It's sanctuary for the TV<br />\nkid. I keep the sound down very low.<br />\nEven so, my roomates think I talk to<br />\nmyself. They can't figure out why I<br />\nspend so much time in my room. I told<br />\nthem I have chronic mono and I have<br />\nto sleep a lot. They really aren't very<br />\nbright.<br />\n<br />\nwant to<br />\npeople about<br />\nreal me, but<br />\nafraid they<br />\nstop taking<br />\nseriously...\"<br />\n<br />\ntell<br />\nthe<br />\nI'm<br />\nwill<br />\nme<br />\n<br />\nA typical day for me goes like this. I<br />\nwake up to the last fifteen minutes of<br />\nGood Morning America. While David<br />\nHartman finishes his spiel, I shower. I<br />\nhave my breakfast with Phil Donahue.<br />\n<br />\nDuring the commercials I do my Spanish<br />\nhomework, and if there's time, the<br />\ndishes. At ten, I scamper off to Spanish,<br />\nwondering what Mario Thomas has got<br />\nthat I haven't. I always schedule a class<br />\nbetween ten and eleven. There isn't<br />\nmuch on except for game shows, and I<br />\ndon't watch those. That's one thing I'm<br />\nfirm about. Even a TV kid has to have<br />\nsome principles. I eat lunch at eleven,<br />\nduring The Love Boat. I used to eat my<br />\nlunch later in the day, but it's hard to<br />\nwatch the Captain and Julie and Gopher<br />\ngorge themselves with food and drink<br />\nwithout getting hungry yourself.<br />\nSometimes I manage to read a couple of<br />\nchapters for school during the show. It<br />\ndepends on which episode it is. For instance, I've seen the one with Ethel Merman thirty-seven times, so I have no<br />\nqualms about watching with just half an<br />\near.<br />\nLast semester I stayed home from<br />\ntwelve to one and went to class from one<br />\nto two. That was a mistake. I like Oprah<br />\nWinfrey, but I can't take Joe Carcionne\u2014my green grocer. All he ever<br />\ndid was hold up vegetables and tell his<br />\nviewer's to eat them,. Once he held up<br />\na turnip and said, \"Folks, this is a great<br />\nvegeTAble.\" He didn't give us one<br />\nhint as to what one actually does<br />\nwith a turnip, but he did say that<br />\nit's very nutritious. You can also<br />\nfreeze them.<br />\nThis semester I'm playing<br />\nit smart: Class from twelve<br />\nto one, All My Children<br />\nfrom one to two. It's the<br />\nonly soap opera I really<br />\nfollow. Except for GH.<br />\nLate afternoon is<br />\na blur. Sesame Street<br />\n(I'm getting a teaching<br />\ncertificate),<br />\nCharlie's<br />\nAngels,<br />\nM*A*S*H, One Day at a Time. Then<br />\nit's time for dinner. Dinner with Dan.<br />\nI watch The CBS Evening News with<br />\nDan Rather out in the living room. I<br />\neven coaxed one of my roommates into<br />\nwatching it once. I don't think she liked it though, she said it was too<br />\ndepressing.<br />\n1 study from seven to nine. The nine<br />\no'clock prime time shows serve as terrific incentives for studying, especially<br />\nthe ABC Wednesday Movie of the<br />\nWeek. It's always a doozy.<br />\nMy favorite show is on at eleven\u2014<br />\nSoap. I like to pretend that I'm one of<br />\nthe Tates. I think Jessica would make<br />\na terrific mother, but I wouldn't want<br />\nto get stuck with Chester (or Jessica's<br />\nchest for that matter). Chuck and Bob<br />\nare very funny. Chuck's a person and<br />\nBob's a dummy, but they both wear the<br />\nsame clothes so it's hard to tell them<br />\napart. The show is great because each<br />\nepisode picks up where the last one left<br />\noff. It's kind of like a soap opera.<br />\nI try to watch David Letterman every<br />\nnight. Most people don't know this, but<br />\nLate Night is very educational. I never<br />\nknew anything about Staten Island or<br />\nthe Bronx until I watched his show. He<br />\ngives guided tours.<br />\nI've watched his show for sixty-seven<br />\nnights in a row. I'm shooting for<br />\nseventy-three. I want to marry David<br />\nLetterman. I figure if I could say,<br />\n\"David, I've watched your show every<br />\nnight for seventy-three straight nights,\"<br />\nhe'd have to take me seriously.<br />\nThat's the problem. I want to tell people about the real me, but I'm afraid<br />\nthey will stop taking me seriously,<br />\nespecially Hopkins people. If only they<br />\nknew how exciting it is to be a TV kid.<br />\nI go to bed with David\u2014wake up with<br />\nPhil. It's not a bad life after all.<br />\n<br />\nAt first glance, the London School<br />\nof Economics does not seem to be a<br />\nvery imposing sort of place. Instead<br />\nof the acres and acres of green grass,<br />\nshiny new buildings and Georgian architecture one becomes accustomed<br />\nto at Hopkins, the LSE consists<br />\nmainly of five or six dirty high-rise<br />\nbuildings tucked away on a crowded<br />\nlittle street next to one of London's<br />\nbusiest intersections. Yet for all that<br />\nthe LSE lacks in lawns and construction dust, it more than makes up for<br />\nit in atmosphere and personality.<br />\nOne of the first things one notices<br />\nabout the LSE is the high level of<br />\npolitical activism in the student body.<br />\nMy year there included an almost<br />\ncontinuous stream of strikes, protest<br />\nmeetings and demonstrations over a<br />\nwide variety of issues, ranging from<br />\ndomestic transport and education<br />\npolices to U.S. intervention in El<br />\nSalvador, Chile and South Africa.<br />\nThough most seemed to think that<br />\nactivism was greatly reduced from<br />\nwhat it had been in the past, it was<br />\nstill a marked contrast to Hopkins.<br />\nOne only has to remember the controversy two years ago, when the<br />\nJ HU Student Council passed a resolution condemning U.S. actions in El<br />\nSalvador. The resultant uproar might<br />\nhave discouraged even the most<br />\nhardened activist from attempting to<br />\nmake any sort of political statement<br />\nin the council.<br />\nThe LSE Student Union, on the<br />\nother hand, regularly called meetings<br />\nsolely for political reasons, often to<br />\nsend letters, petitions and telegrams<br />\nto political leaders. Not only was this<br />\naccepted, but protest only erupted<br />\nafter the union voted to donate<br />\nseveral hundred pounds to what some<br />\nalleged was a South African terrorist<br />\norganization. Another union act involved the establishment of a scholarship fund for a black South African<br />\n<br />\n\fMore Exciting Than Baltimore: Surprised?<br />\nstudent to attend the LSE\u2014something unheard of at Hopkins, where<br />\nSpring Fair committees spend $3000<br />\non \"pizza and other inducements.\"<br />\nIn fact, LSE and other British universities have something remotely similar<br />\nto the Spring Fair called \"Rag<br />\nWeek\" (the main similarity is that<br />\nthey both occur in the spring), but all<br />\nof the activity profits from Rag<br />\nWeek are donated to charity.<br />\nThough much of the political activity at the LSE was probably<br />\n<br />\nfutile\u2014the second time you picket the<br />\nU.S. embassy they stop noticing\u2014<br />\nLSE students can be said to have<br />\nmuch more of a world view than<br />\nHopkins students do.(It is true that<br />\nthe Progressive Student Union at<br />\nHopkins has made great deal of progress in making students politically<br />\naware, however, there still seems a<br />\nlong way to go.)<br />\nIndeed, one of the most important<br />\nthings that one learns at the LSE is<br />\nthat there is a world out there. At<br />\nsome point, I was told that the LSE<br />\nhas students from over 90 countries\u2014you meet and talk to people<br />\nwho have markedly different backgrounds and outlooks, rather than<br />\nthe middle-class existence that most<br />\nat Hopkins seem to share. Students<br />\nwill be facing and trying to solve real<br />\nproblems when they return home;<br />\nLSE always likes to boast about the<br />\nnumber of its graduates who are currently prime ministers\u2014If I remember correctly, the total was 15 when<br />\nI was there.<br />\nPerhaps this sounds too idealistic,<br />\nand in a way it is, because the LSE<br />\nhas a great many \"career-oriented\"<br />\nstudents(the IBM and Citicorp tables<br />\nat career day were mobbed.) But<br />\nmany students\u2014many more than one<br />\never sees here\u2014seem genuinely dedicated and interested in what they<br />\nare studying.<br />\nThere is more to the LSE however,<br />\nthan simply the acquisition of a<br />\npolitical awareness. The school excels<br />\nin economics, offering close to two<br />\nhundred separate courses in the subject. Though the school has some<br />\nfinancial trouble and extracurricular<br />\nactivities are somewhat limited, people tend to substitute enthusiasm and<br />\nspirit for the money rieded. The LSE<br />\ndrama club for example, never had<br />\na budget over $300 for any of its productions, and yet managed to present<br />\nseveral well-performed plays, including one which was awarded \"Best<br />\nProduction\" at the University of<br />\nLondon drama festival.<br />\nThe LSE has other problems, however. Beyond economics and a dozen<br />\n<br />\nor so related topics (political science,<br />\ninternational studies, economic history, etc.) the school's offerings are<br />\nvery thin\u2014no physical or biological<br />\nsciences, little literature or languages.<br />\nand offerings by other departments<br />\ntend to be very uneven. The history<br />\ndepartment, for example, offers<br />\n15-20 survey-type courses and a<br />\nhandful of incredibly obscure topics.<br />\n(My favorite course title was \"War,<br />\nRevolution and Intervention in the<br />\nIberian Peninsula 1808-54.\" The<br />\n<br />\nschool also labors under what can only be described as a very peculiar<br />\nevaluation system. Unlike our continuous evaluation system (quizzes,<br />\ntests, papers, semester grades, etc.)<br />\nmost LSE students take year-long<br />\ncourses where the only grade received is that for the final exam. Most<br />\ncourses generally have two papers<br />\nassigned per term, but while graded,<br />\nthese do not generally count towards<br />\nthe final grade, except in borderline<br />\ncases. Foreign students have the option of not taking exams, but are<br />\ngenerally assigned more class work to<br />\nmake up for it. Even so, it is quite a<br />\nfascinating sight in late May to watch<br />\npeople try and recall things they<br />\nlearned the previous September, and<br />\nattempting to cram a year's worth of<br />\nknowledge into a three-hour exam.<br />\nStrange as this may sound, I think I<br />\nprefer mid-terms and problem sets.<br />\nAnother, more serious problem at<br />\nthe LSE is a severe budget crisis that<br />\nthe school is facing. Though the<br />\nschool did not seem to be too seriously affected by fiscal problems last<br />\nyear, there were continuous rumors<br />\nof departmental cutbacks and closures, which may ultimately do serious damage to the quality of education at the school.<br />\n<br />\nDespite all this, probably the best<br />\npart about the LSE is that it is located<br />\nin London, which is an incredibly interesting and beautiful city. It's like<br />\na vast cultural warehouse waiting to<br />\nbe sifted through\u2014$5 theater tickets,<br />\ntremendous art galleries, the best<br />\nrock-and-roll clubs in the world\u2014it's<br />\nan endlessly fascinating place. On the<br />\nsurface, London does appear to be<br />\nimpersonal and tourist-ridden, but if<br />\none takes the time to explore the side<br />\nstreets, stop for tea and crumpets in<br />\nCovent Garden, or just lie out on the<br />\ngrass in Regent's Park, it becomes<br />\ndifficult not to love it.<br />\nTwo problems with London are<br />\nthe weather and the cost. It seems to<br />\nbe raining three-fourths of the time<br />\nyou're there (except when it's snowing). London and the LSE prove to<br />\nbe a very expensive proposition\u2014<br />\nprobably a total of $11,000 vs.<br />\n$8-9000 at Hopkins, with no financial aid available, though you can get<br />\nloans for foreign study. Housing,<br />\nespecially centrally located places,<br />\ncan be very expensive and difficult to<br />\nfind. I ended up spending my life's<br />\nsavings and I'm still heavily in debt<br />\nto my parents, but my year was quite<br />\nworthwhile, something I'd do again<br />\nwithout hesitation.<br />\n<br />\nHere Is What the Gazette Does<br />\nBY CATHERINE RAEFF<br />\nTo some it is boring, to others informative. It is the Johns Hopkins Gazette<br />\nwhich is published weekly by the Office of Publications under the editorship<br />\nof Robert Hewes and the editorial<br />\nassistance of Billie Walker.<br />\nThe idea of the Gazette was proposed by University President Dr. Steven<br />\nMuller when he came to Hopkins in<br />\n1971. Hewes says, \"Muller thought it<br />\nwould be a good idea to have a regular<br />\npublication circulate among the divisions of the University to improve communication.\" He also proposed that<br />\nthere be a calendar of events for different institutions within the University. Since the first issue was published on<br />\nSeptember 1, 1971, the Gazette has remained the only official publication<br />\njoining all the University divisions,<br />\nwhich include the Peabody Institute,<br />\nSAIS, the Applied Physics Lab, the<br />\nMedical School and the Homewood<br />\nCampus.<br />\nDuring the first year of publication,<br />\nthe Gazette editors used the NewsLetter's typesetting equipment. Since its<br />\nsecond year, the Gazette has been<br />\ntypeset off-campus. The paste-up is<br />\ndone in its own offices and sent to the<br />\nprinter from there.<br />\nThe goal of the Gazette was originally, and still is, to improve communications among the different divisions of<br />\nthe University. Each week Hewes and<br />\nWalker \"collect\" the official announcements, policy statements and news releases in the public relations offices of<br />\nthe various divisions. They then put<br />\nthem together to form the Gazette. The<br />\nnotes and minutes of the academic councils are also published to enable the<br />\nvarious faculties to know what is being<br />\ndiscussed among the other faculties.<br />\nBecause it is a collection of University<br />\nstatements, there are no original reporters and there is no editorial board. As<br />\nHewes said, \"It is a very straightforward<br />\noperation.\"<br />\nStudent opinion of the Gazette is<br />\nbasically one of apathy. Hewes and<br />\nWalker realize \"that the information [itl<br />\n<br />\ncontains is not interesting to students\" Gazette is published each week of the<br />\nand that it is more relevant to the facul- academic year and four times during<br />\nty and administrators. They do feel, June and July. Although the June and<br />\nhowever, that the Gazette is \"the com- July issues are missing from Martin's<br />\nmon denominator for all associated\" collection, he will have amassed a total<br />\nwith the University. The Gazette does of 136 issues by the time he graduates.<br />\nkeep abreast of student affairs, such as Martin feels that \"The Gazette is helpful<br />\nthe Spring Fair, and it welcomes student in integrating all institutions of the<br />\ninput at any time.<br />\nUniversity. One would have to obtain<br />\nWalker said that the Gazette \"is easy and read all the papers of each into pick up and read.\" This seems to dividual institution to get the same<br />\nserve as both an advantage and a disad- knowledge.\" Martin particularly likes<br />\nvantage for the Gazette. Because of its the weekly calendar of events. He did,<br />\nbrevity, many students do not even however, have some constructive cribother reading it and consequently do ticisms to offer. He wishes that the<br />\nnot realize its value. On the other hand, Academic Council notes were more up<br />\nmany read the entire paper cover to to date. This section is very important<br />\ncover in one sitting because it is short since \"it gives a rundown of the<br />\nand direct.<br />\nHomewood AC notes, and that is where<br />\nWhen I asked students around cam- the decisions of the Hopkins underpus what they thought of the Gazette, graduates are made.\" Martin also finds<br />\nmany replied,\"Oh, I don't know. I only that \"sometimes the headline story is<br />\nread it once.\" One freshman finds it too sensationalistic.\"<br />\n\"boring.\" Another young lady said,<br />\nThough it is only four pages (unless<br />\n\"Occasionally the articles interest me,<br />\nbut not usually.\" Many students admit- a major document is printed to make it<br />\nted its value in bringing out the news of eight pages), the Gazette is a profesthe various institutions, but did not feel sional publication.

While there is no scientific app .oach to landing a summer job, there are basics<br />\ntat can give the job seeker a competitive<br />\nadvantage.<br />\n<br />\nIt's been a subtle change, but during<br />\n1982, unknown groups such as the<br />\nHuman League, A Flock of Seagulls<br />\nand Men at Work cracked the hallowed<br />\nTop 40, and \"new wave,\" only five<br />\nyears old, won over. Never accuse the<br />\npublic of being slow. But \"new wave\"<br />\nis no longer new, and neither may it be<br />\ncalled a wave. New wave, by 1983, consists of a series of fragments\u2014rockabilly<br />\nrevival, skanking ska, hammering hardcore, bloated blitz\u2014and most notably<br />\nthe purveyors of dance music for the<br />\n'80s. It is this dance music that has most<br />\nfrequently captured the mid-American<br />\nimagination: the titter-tatter of synths,<br />\nsome shimmering guitar, patently<br />\ncopied black funk bass lines, the steady<br />\ndrum beat call to the dance floor, and<br />\nsome dispassionate vocals on a passionate subject. It tends to move, but<br />\noften in a sterile, antiseptic way. You<br />\ncan dance to \"I Ran\" or \"Don't You<br />\nWant Me,\" but why listen to them at<br />\nhome?<br />\nThat's where the Simple Minds come<br />\nin. New Gold Dream (81-82-83-84)is as<br />\nwarm as it is danceable, as enjoyable on<br />\nyour stereo alone as at Girard's with<br />\nyour loved one. The title track sums it<br />\nup best: a steady, propulsive drum beat<br />\nwith lots of cymbal work and a subtle,<br />\nmoving bass line set the frame on which<br />\nto hang synthesizer washes and guitar<br />\nlines that float in and out like whippedcream clouds. The music may be pure<br />\nconfection, but it's puzzling in its<br />\ndepth\u2014there's just so much to listen to.<br />\n<br />\n3 EASY STEPS TO LANDING A SUMMER JOB<br />\nis a complete guide which tells where the jobs are<br />\nand how to land them.

Unfortunately, his frightening and touching Wings, as produced by Center Stage, gives the viewer an<br />\nevening of possibilities, strong but<br />\nseldom realized.<br />\nThe play opens with a homey scene,<br />\nas Emily Stilson (Bette Henritze) sits<br />\nreading comfortably in her living room<br />\nchair. She suffers a stroke, and what<br />\nfollows is her internal alienation from<br />\nthe melange of mental and physical<br />\nstimuli that her mind cannot quite synthesize. Periods of Faulknerian train of<br />\nthought keep the spectator reeling. Going through moments of oblivious and<br />\noften ecstatic or agonizing alienation,<br />\nEmily communicates the difficulty of<br />\nher plight\u2014or rather Kopit does\u2014<br />\nthrough extended analogy. Especially<br />\nintriguing is the ambiguous ending: does<br />\nshe die?<br />\nDespite the power of the subject,<br />\nWings never quite gets off the ground.<br />\nOriginally written for radio, the production makes use of the recorded word, an<br />\ninnovation marred by a hollow sound<br />\nsystem. Distortion and the electronic<br />\n.music at the end (reminiscent of<br />\nChariots ofFire but less than inspiring)<br />\nalso detract from the performances on<br />\nstage, which is another subject<br />\naltogether.<br />\nThe supporting roles here are inadequate at best. Keeping in mind that this<br />\nis basically a one-woman show, it seems<br />\nthat little care was given to casting the<br />\nmajority of the remaining roles. Chris-<br />\n<br />\ntopher McLann, as Billy, was a remarkable and relieving standout. Daniel<br />\nSzelag and Joanne Manley as two of the<br />\ndoctors who attempt to communicate<br />\nwith Emily portray the cold helplessness<br />\nof their positions\u2014on the outside looking in.<br />\nExhibiting a smooth and grandmotherly voice, Henritze underplays<br />\nEmily Stilson. Her credits and previous<br />\nperformances are impressive, but she is<br />\nout of her element in this type of role.<br />\nIt demands a dynamic, erratic quality<br />\nthat she simply cannot produce. She<br />\ndoes carry more than her weight during<br />\nthe warmer and more touching scenes.<br />\nwith her therapist, Amy (Phyllis Somerville in a disturbingly unfeeling performance), but her delivery of the monologues is not gripping enough; her words<br />\nflow too easily past the audience, become jumbled and lost.<br />\nWhat perhaps saves the show is the<br />\nremarkable set design, and the way<br />\ndirector Stan Wojewodski conducts the<br />\nactors within it. The set captures the<br />\nseparation experienced by Emily, embodied in a series of reflecting partitions<br />\nand boxes that are always in motion. At<br />\nseveral points during the performance,<br />\nthe doctors address one of Emily's many<br />\nreflections or shadows; they cannot<br />\nreach her (\"Is there anything you<br />\nneed?\" asks a nurse. \"A sweater<br />\nplease,\" says Emily. The nurse brings<br />\nher a pillow). The audience, too, is forced to acknowledge its position as a spectator, as it can see its own reflection<br />\nlooking in from the walls that enclose<br />\nEmily, walls that come to symbolize her<br />\nimpenetrability.<br />\nIt is a shame that a play which means<br />\n<br />\n\fNEWS-LETTER/PAGE 13<br />\n<br />\nCreating Sounds You Never Noticed Before<br />\nTopped by Jim Kerr's dubbed and poppish \"Glittering Prize,\" voted most \u2022<br />\nredubbed vocals, it's a musical sundae likely to go Top 40, the keyboard virof numerous flavors and toppings.

Geraldine<br />\nKlauber, however, seemed to be<br />\nhurt by foul trouble as she only scored six points, ten below<br />\nher season average. Amy Buchanan, another strong player,<br />\nscored 12 points, and excelled<br />\nin rebounding.<br />\nThese three players starred<br />\nagain in leading the Jays to victory over Shepherd on January<br />\n31. Unlike many of their other<br />\ngames, Hopkins began the first<br />\nhalf aggressively, outscoring<br />\nShepherd 40-32 by making 42<br />\npercent of their shots. Yet the<br />\nJays did not walk away with the<br />\ngame, as Shepherd gave them a<br />\nscare in the second half by<br />\noutscoring Hopkins 37-32.<br />\nHopkins, though, held their<br />\nown against the onslaught to<br />\nwin 72-69 after the tense final<br />\nminutes.<br />\nAs usual, Dawn Richards<br />\nwas the leading scorer with a<br />\ncareer high of 31 points.<br />\nGeraldine Klauber followed her<br />\nin scoring with 14 points, but<br />\nagain she was hampered by<br />\nfouls, especially in the second<br />\nhalf. Amy Buchanan had an exceptionally good game, scoring<br />\n13 points and grabbing 16 rebounds. She, as well as Joan<br />\nBartlett, hit important free<br />\nthrow situations toward the end<br />\nof the game. According to<br />\nCoach Kay Fowler, this was the<br />\nbest game of Amy Buchanan's<br />\nseason, and the best women's<br />\nbasketball game she has seen<br />\nplayed by Hopkins in two<br />\nyears.<br />\nThe victory over Shepherd<br />\nhas given the Jays the support<br />\nthat they need to continue the<br />\nstruggle against many strong<br />\nopponents. Coach Fowler feels<br />\nthat, \"We finally have our act<br />\ntogether. I had toughened their<br />\nschedule in comparison to last<br />\nyear's opponents, so they have<br />\nbeen, and will be, playing<br />\nagainst tough opposition. Now<br />\nI am looking forward to playing against Western Maryland,<br />\nHood and Swarthmore next<br />\nweek.\" Traditional rival Western Maryland, whom the Jays<br />\nwill be hosting on Monday at<br />\n7:00, beat the Jays last year by<br />\nonly one point. Coach Fowler<br />\nand her team now feel confident that they will be able to<br />\nplay good, close games against<br />\ntheir opposition in their upcoming contests.<br />\n<br />\nWomen Squash Swarthmore<br />\nBY JOHN BEVILACQUA<br />\nThe Hopkins women's squash<br />\nteam convincingly won its<br />\nseason opener on Friday, topping Swarthmore 6-1 in a best<br />\nof seven match.<br />\nHaving lost last year's top<br />\nthree players to graduation,<br />\nfirst-year Coach Eric Dressler<br />\nhas a very young squad of 12,<br />\nwith few seniors. Despite their<br />\nyouth and the fact that none of<br />\nthe players have ever played<br />\nhigher than fourth seed before,<br />\nthe Jays trounced Swarthmore,<br />\n6-1, with only their seventh seed<br />\n<br />\nlosing. Their next match will be<br />\nTuesday night at Franklin and<br />\nMarshall.<br />\nThe highlight of their very<br />\nshort season is the Howe Cup<br />\nTournament at Yale, February<br />\n11-13. About 30 teams compete<br />\nin the tournament that is divided into three brackets. Last<br />\nyear, the Hopkins women were<br />\nplaced in the second bracket<br />\nand did not fare very well. This<br />\nyear, however, they are in the<br />\nthird bracket where Coach Dressler feels the \"women will be<br />\nfar more competitive.\"<br />\nThe top players for Coach<br />\n<br />\nDressler are captain Kathy<br />\nChou, Jessie Chai, Gail Penny<br />\nand Ann Harnwell, with Chai<br />\nbeing their number-one seed. In<br />\npast years, Hopkins has been<br />\ncompetitive with Middle Atlantic Conference foes Swarthmore<br />\nand F&M. They have had considerably less success against<br />\nDivision I and Ivy League<br />\nrivals. This year, however,<br />\nCoach Dressler feels they will<br />\ngive the Ivy League teams<br />\n\"more of a run for the money\"<br />\n'when they meet in the University of Pennsylvania Round<br />\nRobin and the Howe Cup<br />\nTournaments.<br />\n<br />\niveZ.<br />\n<br />\nHEALTH PROFESSIONS<br />\nSCHOLARSHIPS<br />\nIf you're planning a career in<br />\nmedicine you owe it to yourself to<br />\nfind out about the Air Force's<br />\nHealth Professions Scholarship Pro\u2014<br />\ngram.<br />\nQualified<br />\nU.S.<br />\nCitizens<br />\ncan<br />\nreceive scholarships for medical or<br />\nosteopathic school.<br />\nOur scholarships include:<br />\nTuition<br />\nRequire Books<br />\nRequired Lab Fees<br />\nRequired Equipment Rental<br />\nand More Than $550 Monthly Stipend<br />\nT Sgt.

On Saturday,<br />\nthe team met MAC rival Susquehanna, and lost a close<br />\nmatch, 28-21. On Tuesday, tl-K<br />\nJays were dominated by Rutgers-Camden and York, with<br />\nfinal scores of 32-6 and 55-0,<br />\nrespectively.<br />\nThe Susquehanna match saw<br />\nstrong performances by several<br />\nwrestlers. Lee Wagstaff at 142,<br />\nRich Grohol at 177 and Steve<br />\nTristani at heavyweight all<br />\nscored pins against their opponents. Wagstaff showed fine<br />\ncontrol, scoring the fall at 2:40,<br />\nand not allowing his opponent<br />\na single point. Grohol decked<br />\nhis man at 1:03, while Tristani<br />\nneeded only 42 seconds to<br />\nsecure the pin. The remaining<br />\nteam points were scored by Has<br />\nFranklin at 190, who edged out<br />\na 13-12 decision.<br />\n<br />\nMissed opportunities, however, caused the Jays' downfall.<br />\nNick Perrin, at 150, scored a<br />\nnear fall and came within three<br />\npoints before being pinned<br />\nhimself at 5:59. Eddie Brown,<br />\nat 126, tied his match with a<br />\nreversal with less than a minute<br />\nleft, only to have his opponent<br />\nturn the tables again with 13<br />\nseconds remaining to score a<br />\n8-6 win. \"We could have won,<br />\nshould have won,\" admitted<br />\nCoach John Kohler. \"Any<br />\nsingle bout can make the match<br />\ngo one way or another.\"<br />\nThe Jays went into Tuesday's<br />\ntri-meet against experienced<br />\nYork and Rutgers-Camden<br />\nwith some apprehension, and<br />\nleft with a lot of frustration.<br />\nThe grapplers first fell to<br />\nRutgers-Camden, 34-6. Only<br />\nWagstaff and Grohol could<br />\nmanage to score decisions,<br />\nWagstaff by a 5-3 tally, and<br />\nGrohol by an 8-1 margin. The<br />\nteams then watched York handily defeat the same Rutgers<br />\n<br />\nsquad. \"We knew what we<br />\nwere in for,\" said Kohler.<br />\nAgainst York, Wagstaff and<br />\nGrohol were again the standouts, losing by decisions while<br />\nthe rest of the team was all too<br />\nefficiently pinned. Wagstaff<br />\nwas close to tying his match,<br />\nscoring a takedown to come<br />\nwithin two points of a tie, only<br />\nto have his opponent stall sufficiently until time had expired.<br />\nFrustrated? \"No,\" s2id<br />\nKohler,\"We knew we were going to have a rough time, and<br />\nit just happened that nothing<br />\nwent our way. Last year we<br />\nmanaged to give this team a<br />\nmuch better match.\"(The Jays<br />\nlost that one, 32-14)<br />\n\"Of course,\" said Eddie<br />\nBrown. \"It's humiliating to see<br />\none man after another go<br />\ndown.\"<br />\nThe Jays record now stands<br />\nat 3-6. Their next match,<br />\ntomorrow at Albright, promises to be a good bit more<br />\neven-handed than their last.<br />\n<br />\nFencers Check In At 6 & 2<br />\nBY COLIN PHOON<br />\nSix and two. The Jay swordsmen's present mark of six wins<br />\nand two losses appears, once<br />\nagain, to herald a successful<br />\n1983 Middle Atlantic Conference season. Nevertheless,<br />\none cannot help ' but think<br />\nabout a comment somebody<br />\nhad made about last year's 11-3<br />\nrecord: \"mediocre.\" Might this<br />\n1983 season simply be labeled<br />\na \"mediocre\" one for Hopkins<br />\nfencing? Perhaps, but if you<br />\ntake this year's circumstances<br />\ninto account, \"mediocre\" does<br />\nnot quite seem the appropriate<br />\nword.<br />\nThe conference season started quickly with a week-long<br />\nroad trip to northern New<br />\nJersey and the surrounding<br />\nvicinity, and has slowed to a<br />\nsomewhat more reasonable<br />\npace after Intersession. So far,<br />\nthe Jays have defeated SUNY<br />\nMaritime (19-8), Baruch<br />\n(14-13), Hunter (15-12), St.<br />\nPeter's(15-12), Trinity (16-11),<br />\nand the New Jersey Institute of<br />\nTechnology (17-10). Their only two losses came at the hands<br />\nof Lafayette (16-11) and<br />\nWilliam Paterson (14-13).<br />\nPart of the problem with this<br />\nyear's team is a lack of experience in a large fraction of<br />\nthe team. Many varsity fencers<br />\nare new, filling the ranks of<br />\nseniors who graduated or injured fencers. Of the 15 varsity<br />\nstarters, only seven have had<br />\npast varsity experience: epeeists<br />\nRoger Blauvelt and Pat Havens, sabre Taro Adachi, and<br />\nfoilsmen John Tu, Dave Weiner, John Cummings and Andy Goldberg. Of those same 15,<br />\n12 are sophomores. The team,<br />\nthen, cannot be adequately<br />\njudged simply as \"mediocre\"<br />\nbut rather as \"inexperienced.\"<br />\nFoil captain John Tu believes<br />\nthat Hopkins' inexperience was<br />\na key factor in the loss to a<br />\nveteran Lafayette team. This<br />\n<br />\nsame basic flaw probably in- has compiled a 12-10 record,<br />\nfluenced the outcome of the while sabre captain Taro<br />\nPaterson meet. William Pater- Adachi is in a slump (7-15).<br />\nson, a school which the Jays Chen is probably the team's<br />\ntraditionally conquer, nipped foremost sabreman, and conthe swordsmen this year. \"It tinues to improve.

Foilsmen John Jay swordsmen, and there is<br />\nTu and Andy Goldberg are still plenty of time for things to<br />\neach at 17-4, and Dave Weiner turn around and for the team to<br />\nis 11-4.

Through<br />\nsports we gain a sense of cornraderie, self-discipline and the<br />\nability to interact within a<br />\ngroup. Thus, athletics form one<br />\nmajor aspect of our educational<br />\nsystem. The other significant<br />\nfactor within our development<br />\nis academic pursuits. These two<br />\nimportant elements in our educational process are not mutual<br />\nly exclusive, and the person<br />\nwho strives for both athletic<br />\nand academic achievement<br />\ngains a great deal from our<br />\nsociety.<br />\nEducation is not merely a<br />\nprocess begun in one day and<br />\nfinished in one month, a year,<br />\nor twenty-five years; it is a combination of factors that continually influence a person's<br />\nlife. Sports and formal schooling play major roles in our<br />\nlives. In short, from childhood<br />\nthrough college and upward,<br />\nthe sports and academic worlds<br />\nare parts of the lives of many<br />\nof us. For some, one dominates<br />\nthe other; for the lucky few,<br />\nboth live in happy coexistence.<br />\nAs children our dreams are a<br />\nsignificant part of our reality,<br />\nand this reality is filled with<br />\nsports fantasies.

I start<br />\nthem out throwing seven minutes a day and increase the<br />\namount they throw as they progress. I also work a lot with the<br />\nrookies; for example, I've had<br />\nJohn Shelby doing a lot of bunting, both sacrifice and drag.\"<br />\nThe hitters try to get in some<br />\nkind of rhythm and toughen up<br />\ntheir hands, says Terry Crowey, \"In here it's not a question<br />\nof hitting well, it's getting your<br />\nshoulders and hips in shape so<br />\nthat you're ready when you get<br />\nout on the field later.\" On the<br />\nday the News-Letter visited, the<br />\nplayers working out included<br />\nKen Singleton, Terry Crowley,<br />\nCal Ripken, Jr., John \"Tbone\" Shelby, Mike Flanagan,<br />\nJim Palmer, Dennis Martinez,<br />\nTim Stoddard and several<br />\nminor league players.<br />\nNot all the players, though,<br />\nwork out at the stadium. Rich<br />\nDauer hasn't been in, but is<br />\nplanning to go to training camp<br />\na week early. Eddie Murray<br />\nnormally doesn't pick up a bat<br />\nuntil a week before spring training. Rick Dempsey, who lives in<br />\nCalifornia, has his own batting<br />\ncage in his backyard and many<br />\nof the Orioles who live on the<br />\nWest Coast ork out with him.<br />\nA lot of the Orioles were<br />\nhampered last year by physical<br />\nproblems, and most have been<br />\non rehabilitative programs during the off-season. Ken Singleton, who was bothered by<br />\nweakness in his right hand and<br />\nbatted only .251, says he \"feels<br />\nbetter now than at any time last<br />\nseason,\" and thinks he'll have<br />\nhis typical year. John Shelby<br />\nunderwent elbow surgery this<br />\nwinter to remove bone, chips,<br />\nbut has been throwing and<br />\nshould not be bothered by his<br />\nelbow when the season starts.<br />\nAccording to Elrod Hendricks,<br />\npitcher Tim Stoddard, who suffered a fall last September and<br />\nrequired knee surgery, is progressing well and should be 100<br />\npercent by spring training. But<br />\nHendricks says the progress of<br />\npitcher Scott McGregor, who<br />\nwas bothered by a strained<br />\nshoulder for most of the second<br />\nhalf of the season last year, has<br />\nbeen slower than hoped for.<br />\nCenterfielder Al Bumbry had a<br />\nsimilar problem with his legs,<br />\nand for he and McGregor, only time will tell how long complete recovery takes.<br />\nThe only major change in the<br />\nOrioles since last year is the new<br />\nmanager, Joe Altobelli. Altobelli spent the past two seasons<br />\nas third-base coach for the<br />\nYankees and previously served<br />\nas manager of the San Francisco Giants from 1977 to 1979.<br />\nHe has managed in the Oriole<br />\nfarm system for 11 years, including the Triple-A club at<br />\nRochester from 1971 to 1976.<br />\nWhile at Rochester, Altobelli<br />\nmanaged seven of the current<br />\nOrioles: Al Bumbry, Terry<br />\nCrowley, Rich Dauer, Mike<br />\nFlanagan, Dennis Martinez,<br />\nScott McGregor and Eddie<br />\n<br />\nMurray. Says Crowley of the<br />\nnew manager, \"I think Joe's<br />\ngoing to do just fine. He's<br />\nfamiliar with the Oriole organization and he's a good baseball<br />\nman.\"<br />\n<br />\nKen Singleton<br />\n<br />\nA minor change from last<br />\nyear was the release of pitchers<br />\nRoss Grimsley and Don Stanhouse, who are now trying to<br />\nlatch on with other clubs. Also,<br />\nthe status of leftfielder John<br />\nLowenstein, who is a free<br />\nagent, is still up in the air.<br />\n<br />\nBaltimore did not make any<br />\ntrades or acquire any free<br />\nagents in the off-season, but is<br />\nstill trying to obtain a veteran<br />\nthird baseman. They have offered a major pitcher to the<br />\nTexas Rangers for Buddy Bell,<br />\nbut have had no luck so far.<br />\nThe Orioles have been almost<br />\nas busy during the off-season as<br />\nthey were when they were playing. Besides the team workouts,<br />\neach player is put on an exercise program by the manager.<br />\nSome of the players are members of the Oriole basketball<br />\nteam, which plays in charity<br />\ngames, and many are also busy<br />\nin charity organizations or with<br />\nspeaking engagements. Ken<br />\nSingleton, besides his workouts, arm therapy and local TV<br />\nnews appearances, has been involved in the Special Olympics<br />\nand the American Cancer Society. He feels that, \"Professional athletes most definitely<br />\nhave a responsibility to be active in charity work, especially<br />\nwhen they live in a community.<br />\nBeing active in the community<br />\nis one way for us to show the<br />\nfans that we appreciate the support they give us during the<br />\nseason.\" Cal Ripken, Jr., who<br />\ntook part in the March of<br />\nDimes Telethon, says that,<br />\n\"Because of our names we are<br />\nable to do more than the everyday person; it makes you feel<br />\ngood to visit people in a<br />\nhospital.\"<br />\n<br />\n\u2022<br />\n<br />\n\u2022<br />\n<br />\nBob Wilson on the boards.<br />\nI.<br />\n<br />\n\fNE\u2018VS-LETTER/PAGE 19<br />\n<br />\nCampus Notes<br />\nhe Passano Foundation Lecture<br />\nLa Societa ltaliana will hold a Tavola<br />\npresents J.

After<br />\nour protest, they showed us<br />\nseveral rooms they were convert<br />\ning. They were too small to be<br />\nsingles.\"<br />\nAccording to Angela Wickham, the director of Housing,<br />\nthe rooms were chosen because<br />\nthey were large enough to be<br />\nconverted. \"The information<br />\nthey wanted,\" she said, \"was<br />\nlast-minute information not<br />\navailable to give to the people<br />\nwho were asking questions.\"<br />\nShe claimed that the information was posted when it became<br />\navailable, and that students<br />\nwho signed the leases were expected to have inspected the<br />\nrooms before selecting them.<br />\nThe intent was that students<br />\nwould not lease apartments<br />\nthey did not want.<br />\nDuring the summer, students<br />\nwere notified that, due to<br />\ncancellations, there were still<br /><br />\nspaces remaining in Universityowned housing. According to<br />\nKun, there is therefore no need<br />\nfor more conversions.

These<br />\ndorms will not be completed<br />\nuntil 1985, however, and the<br />\nHousing Office sees a more immediate, need, resulting in the<br />\nrecent conversions.<br />\nThe rooms that were converted cost slightly more than<br />\nhalf the price charged to one<br />\nstudent in an equivalent single<br />\nroom. For example, a room in<br />\na three-bedroom apartment for<br />\nthree people costs $1770 for a<br />\nnine-month lease, and a person<br />\nsharing a room in a threebedroom apartment for four<br />\npeople would pay only $1140,<br />\nor 64 percent of the threeperson cost.<br />\nMore rooms may be converted to doubles next year.<br /><br />\nPAGE 4/FEBRUARY 4, 1983<br /><br />\nThe Hopkins<br /><br />\nNews-Letter<br />\nNowhere To Go But Up<br />\nThe administration recently formed a committee to study student amenities at Johns<br />\nHopkins. The task of the committee is to<br />\nestablish the most important non-academic<br />\nneeds of students over the next twenty years.<br />\nThe report generated by this Student Life<br />\nPlanning Committee will be used as a fundraising document in the upcoming Capital<br />\nCampaign. Although the administrators and<br />\nstudents on the committee only have a few<br />\nweeks in which to draw up a rough draft of<br />\nthis report, the subject is one of such vital<br />\nimportance that it demands undivided attention and thought.<br />\nIt is essential that the committee approach<br />\nthis task in a comprehensive and coordinated<br />\nmanner. Merely producing a shopping list<br />\nof buildings and programs that students<br />\nwould like to see would be ineffectual.<br />\nSpecific goals must be defined and suggestions for change must be geared towards<br />\nfulfilling these goals.<br />\nThe first necessary step is to identify the<br />\nmajor problems of student life at Hopkins.<br />\nTwo obvious ones stand out: the lack of a<br />\ncollegiate atmosphere and an apathetic attitude towards extracurricular activities. A<br />\nthird problem, probably of less concern to<br />\nmost undergraduates but nevertheless important, is the isolation of Hopkins students<br />\nfrom the cultural and social activities of<br />\nBaltimore. While these problems may be<br />\neasy to identify, they are difficult to solve.<br />\nAdvocating major changes necessarily involves guesswork about future student attitudes and uncontrollable external circumstances. However, there are some areas<br />\nin which changes are appropriate and would<br />\nadd to the quality of student life.<br />\nPerhaps the most vital aspect of the student environment demanding attention is<br />\nhousing. Every student requires living space,<br />\ntherefore the housing issue affects all undergraduates. In the first place, the quality of<br />\naccommodations must be upgraded. The<br />\npresent construction of new dormitories and<br />\nthe proposed renovation of existing dorms<br />\nwill contribute much to this end. However,<br />\noff-campus University-owned housing is in<br />\ndire need of rehabilitation, as plumbing,<br />\nelectrical service and appearance are rapidly dilapidating. In addition, it may be<br />\nnecessary over the next twenty years, to construct even more dormitories on campus. Efforts to place more students on the Homewood campus full time would certainly<br />\nfacilitate a more cohesive social atmosphere.<br />\nThe scattering of undergraduates throughout<br />\nthe Charles Village community is one of the<br />\nmain culprits of a dismal collegiate climate.<br />\nWhile additional on-campus housing facilities<br />\nwill be helpful, it is essential to maintain a<br />\nhigh standard of accommodation in order<br />\nto ensure that students chose to live on campus rather than in the community.<br />\nAlso central to the improvement of the<br />\nHopkins social scene is the establishment of<br />\na legitimate student union. Levering Hall is<br />\ninadequate because its facilities are shared<br />\nwith non-student concerns. At this point it<br />\nremains unknown whether the common<br />\nspace in the old dormitories will fulfill this<br />\nfunction. An ideal student union should contain a recreational room, a lounge, conference rooms and a theater. Many problems<br />\nexist with Shriver Hall and the Listening/Viewing room. Neither has enough<br />\nroom for building sets, and while Shriver<br />\ndoes have satisfactory backstage facilities,<br /><br />\nthe size of the hall is impractical for many<br />\nstudent productions. In order to substantially contribute to a healthy collegiate atmosphere, a student union should also contain a pub, coffee house and snack bar.<br />\nIdeally it should have a dining facility as<br />\nwell. It is appalling that there is only one<br />\nplace on campus where students can eat with<br />\na meal card. The institution of a meal plan<br />\nwith just five meals a week and an additional<br />\neating facility would be convenient and<br />\nuseful.<br />\nMuch of the student apathy at Hopkins<br />\ncan be attributed to a tough, competitive<br />\nacademic environment. However, there is<br />\nalso the possibility that more modern<br />\nfacilities would attract students to extracurricular pursuits. Improvement of some of the<br />\nathletic fields may encourage interest in intramural sports, a new theater may spur students to become involved in drama, and a<br />\nmodernized band room may generate more<br />\nmusical extracurricular activity. The<br />\nfeasibility of solutions to these problems,<br />\nhowever, must be analyzed carefully.<br />\nBuilding new facilities left and right, for example, would be a mistake because the student body at Hopkins is small and would not<br />\nbe able to sustain a large number of additions. Careful improvements, however,<br />\nwould certainly be welcomed by the student<br />\nbody.<br />\nEven with the creation of new and modernized facilities geared towards extracurricular concerns, Hopkins will remain unable<br />\nto fulfill all of the social desires of students.<br />\nThe city of Baltimore, however, has many<br />\ncultural and social activities to offer of which<br />\nmany Hopkins students fail to take advantage. The University should make a concerted effort to eliminate the barrier between<br />\nHomewood and Baltimore. Students should<br />\ncontinuously be provided with information<br />\nabout events occurring in the city, and even<br />\nmore importantly, students should be<br />\ngranted access to these activities. Few<br />\nHopkins students have cars, making<br />\ntransportation somewhat of a problem,<br />\nespecially at night. It might be a good idea<br />\nto provide a shuttle service, leaving<br />\nHomewood throughout the day and night,<br />\nmaking stops at various museums, the Inner Harbor, Fells Point, and other points of<br />\ninterest. Furthermore, the University should<br />\nactively encourage participation in community events by acquiring discount student<br />\ntickets to plays and concert.<br />\nWhatever suggestions the committee eventually decides to incorporate into its report,<br />\nthe most important thing is that they reflect<br />\na coherent philosophy of student needs.<br />\nClear directions need to be established; a<br />\nhaphazard list of student concerns must be<br />\navoided at all costs. Priorities must be set.<br />\nIt is unfortunate that the committee has<br />\nso little time in which to work. Time constraints will make input from the general student body that much more difficult. Yet, it<br />\nis important that attempts are made to ascertain students' views. One way to do this is<br />\nthrough the News-Letter. All students should<br />\nthink seriously about this subject and send<br />\ntheir thoughts to the editor next week. A<br />\nhealthy response would mean a lot to the<br />\ncommittee and to the future of Johns<br />\nHopkins. Time is short but the development<br />\nof a coordinated and sensible document<br />\noutlining student non-academic needs over<br />\nthe next twenty years is not an impossibility.<br /><br />\nLetters<br />\nDraft Registration: Something To Think About<br />\nTo the Editor:<br />\nI want to share some thoughts<br />\nwith you.<br />\nI recently received a letter<br />\nfrom the Selective Service. It informed me that I have been<br />\nnegligent in my duty to register<br />\nfor military service, and requested that I do so now. I expect that a number of other<br />\nmen in this area received similar<br />\nletters, and that many will have<br />\nresponded already. That does<br />\nnot make this letter obsolete.<br />\nThe questions I raise here will<br />\nremain vital as long as registration remains in effect and there<br />\nis the possibility of a draft. Furthermore, these thoughts are<br />\nnot meant only for the young<br />\nmen who still face this question.<br />\nI direct them also to the women, to the older members of<br />\nthe community and to those<br />\n\"ho have already made a decision.<br />\nAs I face this dilemma at this<br />\ntime there are clearly two fundamental possibilities: registration and non-registration. The<br />\nlatter could potentially result in<br />\nbeing asked to fight and to die<br />\nfor reasons with which I do not<br />\nagree. Obviously, neither of<br />\nthese outcomes is inevitable. It<br />\nis precisely for that reason that<br />\nI am writing, because we can<br />\ncontrol these outcomes only to<br />\nthe extent that we actively<br />\nprepare for the future. Before<br />\nI embark on any course, I feel<br />\nI need to come to terms with<br />\nwhat it could mean.<br />\nYou do, too.<br />\nHave you registered? What<br />\nwere your reasons? Are those<br />\nreasons still appropriate?<br />\nIs military service your<br />\nobligation to this country?<br /><br />\nWould you die for this country? In which situation?<br />\nWould you kill for this country? Can this country ask that<br />\nof you?<br />\nDo you believe that our<br />\nleaders will respect these<br />\nfeelings?<br />\nThere may be some who feel<br />\nI exaggerate by taking registration to imply a draft and even<br />\nwar. I am unable to do otherwise. Speaking of registration \u2022<br />\nwithout thinking of a draft<br />\nseems to me like speaking of intercourse without considering<br />\npregnancy. If we are ready to<br />\naccept that possibility, then we<br />\nneed only watch and wait.

The<br />\nAcademic Council decided instead to rely only on good faith<br />\nefforts from each department.<br />\nThe Academic Council's<br />\ndecision grew from a simple<br />\ndilemma. They are afraid to<br />\nstep on the toes of individual<br />\ndepartments, but, as their<br />\nminutes state, \"whatever else<br />\nmight be true, we cannot be in<br />\nfavor of people teaching who<br />\ncan't speak English.\"<br />\nThe same week the Academic<br />\nCouncil made their nondecision, a group of physics<br />\nTAs sent a letter to the NewsLetter. This letter implied that<br />\nthere was no difference between<br />\nnative and foreign TAs, and<br />\nthat problems with foreign TAs<br />\nwere based on student impressions rather than on reality.<br />\nOne of the letter's signers later<br />\nsaid the problem was one of accents, not vocabulary or grammer: \"There aren't any<br />\ngraduate students [in the<br />\nPhysics Department] who can't<br />\nspeak English.\"<br />\nThat's not what the<br />\nundergraduates say.

Dr. Anfinsen, who is a<br />\nNobel laureate in chemistry and<br />\nalso holds a joint appointment<br />\nin the Biology Department,<br />\nsays his job is \"to find sources<br />\nof support for research, to<br />\nfigure out ways of exchanging<br />\ninformation throughout the<br />\nUniversity of opportunities for<br />\nfunds, and to keep everyone informed as to what is going on<br />\nin the administration and various divisions in terms of<br />\nincome.\"<br />\nThere are similar offices in<br />\nother Hopkins institutions. Mr.<br />\nJohn Kudless says his job as<br />\ndirector of the Office of Development at the School of Hygiene is \"to identify private-<br /><br />\nsector funding for SHPH<br />\nprograms.\"<br />\nIndustry supports basic research by giving gifts to universities, supporting specific research programs by grants and<br />\nby financing joint universityindustry institutes. The most<br />\nprevalent at Hopkins are industry grants for specific projects, particularly at the medical<br />\ninstitutions where developments are more likely to be<br />\nmarketable. For example, the<br />\nCosmetics Association is funding basic research to develop effective in vitro toxicology tests<br />\nwhich would replace animal<br />\ntesting and ultimately make it<br />\ncheaper to test the safety of new<br />\nproducts.<br />\nAccording to Mr. Kudless,<br />\nmost industry grants are similar, \"Industry is only willing to<br />\nfund basic research if there is a<br />\nrelevance to application somewhere down the-road.\" Biotechnology, especially recombinant DNA work, dominates the university-industry<br />\nventures, but agreements have<br />\nalso been made in fields such as<br />\nmicro-electronics, polymers<br />\nand robotics. The way most of<br /><br />\nthese are arranged is for the<br />\nuniversity to retain any patent<br />\nrights, and the industry, in exchange for funding, to receive<br />\nexclusive rights to licensing of<br />\nany developments.<br />\nThe five year-2.5 million dollar agreement between Hopkins<br />\nand American Cyanamid to<br />\nstudy allergies and lung disorders is typical in size of most<br />\ncontracts, although they can be<br />\nas large as Monsanto's five<br />\nyear-23.5 million dollar funding<br />\nof protein and peptide research<br />\nat Washington University in St.<br />\nLouis.<br />\nThis type of funding, however, does have risks. Dr. Anfinsen says, \"We are worried<br />\nabout the impact on the attitude of research people, particularly the young guys who<br />\nmay tend to tailor their research<br />\nor the selection of projects<br />\nalong the lines that it may make<br />\na lot of money instead of<br />\nsomething which is very important fundamentally. That should<br />\nbe avoided at all costs.\"<br />\nDr. Tim Duelfer, a postdoctoral researcher at the School of<br />\nHygiene, cautions, \"Industry<br />\nfunding is good in that it takes<br />\na lot of the financial burden off<br />\nof the universities. The threat is<br />\nthat industry may exert control<br />\nover what is being done, which<br />\ncould lead to a lot of bad<br />\nresearch. I don't think Hopkins<br />\nwould want to be known for<br />\ndeveloping an improved catsup<br />\nthickener.\"<br />\nIn response to the increased<br />\ninteraction between academe<br />\nand industry, a national conference on university-corporate<br />\nrelations in science and technology was held last December<br />\n14, 15 and 16 in Philadelphia,<br /><br />\nIs Sex An Issue For You?<br />\nIt Is For Zeniada<br />\nAnd We Need Your Help<br />\nwriterseditorsartistspoetsproofreaders<br />\nadsellersbusinesspeoplephotographers<br />\ndesignersproductionassistantsresearchers<br /><br />\nCome To Our First Meeting!<br />\nCurrent Staff Expected<br />\nNew Members Welcome<br /><br />\nSunday, February 6, 3 p.m.<br />\nThe Little Theatre<br />\n(Chester's Place)<br /><br />\nhosted by eight universities, ineluding Hopkins.<br />\nIn his welcoming remarks,<br />\nSheldon Hackney, president of<br />\nthe University of Pennsylvania,<br />\nsaid,\"At this conference we intend to come to grips with the<br />\nopportunities and challenges, as<br />\nwell as the risks, of research<br />\npartnerships between industry<br />\nand academe in full view of<br />\npublic interest groups and<br />\nmedia. We must acknowledge<br />\nthe distance that divides [business and academe, including]<br />\nquestions of proprietary knowledge, and academic freedom<br />\nand the free flow of information\u2014the tensions between<br />\nbasic and applied research. We<br />\nmust find satisfactory solutions<br />\nto bridge those distances.\"<br />\nThe conference, entitled<br />\n\"Partners in the Research<br />\nEnterprise,\" was funded by the`<br />\nSmithkline Beckman Corporalion and attended by university presidents, senior corporate<br />\nofficers, government officials,<br />\nrepresentatives of the professional scientific societies, trade<br />\nassociations, public interest<br />\ngroups and the news media.<br /><br />\nAlthough the conference did<br />\nnot provide any solutions, it did<br />\nopen communication between-<br /><br />\nChristian Anfinsen<br /><br />\nsenior officials of government,<br />\nindustry and academe through<br />\nwhich future problems may be<br />\nsatisfactorily solved.<br />\nIt is felt that the amount of<br />\nfunding industry may eventually grant for basic research will<br />\nnot be significant compared to<br />\npublic support and will not<br />\nreplace government cuts. Dr.<br />\nHackney stated, \"Both universities and corporations recognize the need for the federal<br />\ngovernment to maintain its<br />\nlong-standing commitment to<br />\nbasic research.\"<br /><br />\nDitto Government<br />\nThe majority of funding for<br />\nbasic scientific research done in<br />\nthe U.S. comes from the federal<br />\nand state governments. Most of<br />\nthe state money supports state<br />\nuniversities and research on the<br />\nlocal level. Due to the federal<br />\nbudget cuts of the current administration, funding for basic<br />\nresearch, and education in gen-.<br />\neral, is becoming more difficult<br />\nto obtain. According to Dr.<br />\nTerence Risby, an associate<br />\nprofessor at the School of<br />\nHygiene, \"The effects [of the<br />\ncuts] have been felt in the last<br />\nsix months and have been devastating. Some research programs have been cut out cornpletely.\"<br />\nIn the January 3 issue of The<br />\nChemical &amp; Engineering News,<br />\nthe fiscal 1983 research and\u2022<br />\ndevelopment budgets of the<br />\nmajor federal angencies as<br />\npassed by Congress were listed.<br />\nCongress funded all but the<br />\nDepartment of Defense at a<br />\nhigher level than requested by<br />\nPresident Reagan. The percentage of change from the 1982<br />\nfigures in each agency are as<br />\nfollows: Dept. of Defense,+14<br />\npercent; National Air and<br />\nSpace Administration;+17 percent; National Institutes of<br />\nHealth,+10 percent; Dept. of<br />\nEnergy, \u20145 percent; National<br />\nScience Foundation,+ 10 percent; Dept. of. Agriculture,+6<br />\npercent; Dept. of Commerce,-5<br />\npercent; and the Environmental Protection Agency,-723 percent. These agencies support<br />\nresearch with private companies<br />\nand by financing their own<br />\nresearch laboratories,<br />\nA researcher obtains a grant<br />\nby sending his proposal to an<br />\nappropriate angency. If the<br />\nproposal is approved, the grant<br /><br />\nmoney is forwarded to the<br />\nuniversity, which keeps a portion for overhead, and the remainder is given to the research<br />\ner, who uses it to finance his<br />\nlaboratory. Unfortunately, the<br />\nawarding of grants can be unfair; new or esoterical areas of<br />\nresearch are often underfunded. Also, the drafting of proposals is too time consuming,<br />\ntime which researchers feel is<br />\nwasted.<br />\nIn government contracted laboratories, an agency appropriates a certain amount of money<br />\nfor the facility to perform<br />\nresearch. The Commerce Department supports research<br />\nfacilities at the National Bureau<br />\nof Standards. The scientists do<br />\nnot have to submit proposals;<br />\nthey are allocated a fixed sum<br />\nof money to conduct their<br />\nresearch.<br />\nWith the current economic<br />\nsituation, funding for science is expected to decrease, since support for education and research<br />\nhas always been the first cut<br />\nduring hard times. Says Dr.<br />\nRisby, \"Graduate and postdoctoral support and the number<br />\nof junior faculty members will<br />\nbe hurt the most. This is very<br />\nbad for education, since these<br />\nare the educators of the fu<br />\nture. . .It will also affect the<br />\ntotal number of research programs going on, and will make<br />\nit difficult for the U.S. to maintam n superiority in the basic<br />\nsciences.\"<br />\nThe consequences of prolonged reduction in basic research will be felt in the future,<br />\nwhen the absence of new technology and inventions allows<br />\nother developed countries to<br />\nsurpass the U.S. scientifically<br />\nand economically.<br /><br />\nNEWS-LETTER/PAGE 9,<br /><br />\nHalls Of Fame<br /><br />\nRowland:A Student But Not A Park<br />\nBY PAUL G. BRUNETTA<br />\nBorn on November 26, 1848,<br />\nHenry Rowland expressed an<br />\ninterest in physics during the<br />\nearly stages of his development.<br />\nAt three years of age, he made<br />\na model of a clock from a cardboard box. At fourteen, he experimented with the new ideas<br />\nof electricity and magnetism.<br />\nRowland constructed his own<br />\nLeyden jars to supply an electrical current to his experiments. He used layers of paper<br />\nto insulate the wires, but this<br />\napproach was later patented by<br />\nsomeone else. At seventeen, he<br />\nmanufactured a furnace which<br />\nmelted iron so he could make<br />\nhis own castings for experimental equipment. Perhaps his<br />\nmost calamitous experiment<br />\nwas when he created a hot air<br />\nballoon from newspapers and<br />\nsailed it over his neighborhood.<br />\nThe invention burst into flames,<br />\ndescended onto a nearby roof<br />\nand precipitated the speedy arrival of the local fire department.<br />\nHenry Rowland's father,<br />\ngrandfather and great-grandfather were Presbyterian ministers, and it was expected that<br />\nhe, too, would join the ministry.<br />\nHis father's death in 1849 left<br />\nHarriette Rowland in custody<br />\nof her son, and she packed him<br />\noff to the Newark Academy in<br />\nNew Jersey when he was fourteen. Rowland spent three<br />\nseemingly worthless years studying Greek and Latin, and<br />\nthen transferred to the Phillips<br />\nAcademy in Andover.<br />\nBut he hated Phillips. The<br />\nprincipal once commented that<br />\nRowland had \"gained nothing<br />\nfrom the school.\" His secondary education, however, was<br />\nmonotonous enough to bore<br />\nany student. His first semester<br />\noffered Latin lessons, Latin<br />\ngrammar and Latin reading;<br />\nthe second term enforced Latin<br />\nreading, Latin grammar and<br />\nLatin prose composition; and<br />\nthe third term consisted of<br />\nLatin grammar, Roman history<br />\nin Latin, ancient history and<br />\narithmetic.<br />\nRowland's next move was to<br />\nthe Renssalaer Polytechnic Institute in Troy, New York. This<br />\nuniversity provided him with a<br />\nwelcome change from the classics and offered a strong program in Newtonian mechanics<br />\nand calculus. His interests in<br />\nelectricity and magnetism,<br />\nhowever, had to be pursued on<br />\nhis own time<br />\nRowland-spent several months<br />\nof his junior year at the Sheffield Scientific School at Yale,<br />\nand then returned to R.P.I. to<br />\ncomplete his degree in civil<br />\nengineering. From his memoirs,<br />\nit is apparent that Michael<br />\nFaraday had a tremendous influence on his life, and he kept<br />\nbound dairies of experiments<br />\nand notes on electricity and<br />\nmagnetism. Faraday's \"Experimental Researches in Electricity\" was his bible, and he<br />\npondered the difficulties of<br />\nmeasuring magnetic permeability and the magnetic effect of a<br />\nmoving body carrying an electrostatic charge.<br /><br />\nRowland received his degree<br />\nfrom R.P.I. in 1870 and became a surveyor for the Western New York Railroad for a<br />\nyear. He was then appointed<br />\nassistant professor of natural<br />\nscience at Wooster University in<br />\nOhio, and returned to R.P.I. a<br />\nyear later to teach electrodynamics. His students rated<br />\nhis course in the subject \"the<br />\nhardest in the institute\" and<br />\nconsidered him \"the smartest<br />\nman on the faculty.\" About his<br />\nteaching ability, they commented that he could not \"im-<br /><br />\nRowland secured a position<br />\nin the laboratory of Hermann<br />\nvon Helmholtz during his year<br />\nabroad before the opening of<br />\nHopkins in 1876. In Berlin, he<br />\ndecided to test one of Faraday's<br />\nunproven hypotheses on convection currents. Faraday had<br />\nspeculated that \"if a ball be<br />\nelectrified in the middle of a<br />\nroom and then be moved in any<br />\ndirection, effects will be produced as if a current in the same<br />\ndirection had existed.\"<br />\nHelmholtz had failed to detect<br />\nthese magnetic effects, but<br /><br />\nRowland Hall<br /><br />\npart knowledge to others...No<br />\none can excel him in blind<br />\nquestions, and his explanations<br />\nare useful only to himself.\"<br />\nRowland was obviously more<br />\ninterested in his own research<br />\nendeavors than in his students,<br />\nbut he was a teacher by example and always provided his<br />\nstudents with the first reports<br />\non his research.<br />\nAs a professor at Renssalaer,<br />\nhe was interested in Faraday's<br />\nobservation of the resemblance<br />\nbetween the electric field and<br />\nthe magnetic field. Rowland<br />\nconstructed a special galvanometer and carefully graphed the<br />\nmagnetic field around cores of<br />\nvarious materials excited by<br />\nelectrical currents of different<br />\nstrengths. His experimental<br />\nresults illustrated that the<br />\nstrength of the magnetic field<br />\nvaries in proportion to the<br />\nresistance of permeability of the<br />\nmaterial. These findings in magnetic permeability complemented Ohm's law of electrical resistance.<br /><br />\nDaniel Colt Gilman resigned<br />\nas president of the University of<br />\nCalifornia to organize the<br />\nJohns Hopkins Universitiy, his<br />\nconcept of the ultimate scientific institution. Gilman was<br />\nvisiting West Point's Military<br />\nAcademy in 1875 and met<br />\nRowland in Troy to interview<br />\nhim for a teaching position.<br />\nMaxwell's letters were excellent<br />\nrecommendations, and Gilman<br />\nhired the young man to organize the physics department at<br />\nHopkins. Classes were not<br />\nscheduled to begin until 1876,<br />\nhowever, and Gilman proposed that Rowland travel around<br />\nEurope and establish ties with<br />\nprominent physicists. He was<br />\nreceived warmly by Maxwell at<br />\nCambridge and brought considerable attention to Hopkins<br />\nupon his return in 1876. He<br />\ncontinued to teach and conduct<br />\nresearch until his death in 1901.<br /><br />\nRowland succeeded by adding<br />\na structure to the design of the<br />\napparatus which amplified the<br />\nweak charge produced. His results were accurate enough to<br />\ntest the ratio of the electrostatic<br /><br />\nforce to the electromagnetic<br />\nforce.<br />\nRowland was 27 when he was<br />\ninvited to join the founding<br />\nfaculty of Johns Hopkins University, and he lived up to<br />\nGilman's notion of the physicist<br />\nand teacher Hopkins needed.<br />\nRowland was instructed by Gilman and by the Hopkins Trustees to inspect various university physics labs during his<br />\nEuropean tour of 1875-76.<br />\nRowland compiled a list of instruments which were necessary<br />\nfor his lab, and they were purchased for approximately<br />\n56500. These, along with his<br />\nown personal equipment, were<br />\nmoved to a temporary lab<br />\nfacility\u2014two former boarding<br />\nhouses on the corner of Howard<br />\nand Little Ross streets in<br />\nBaltimore.<br />\nRowland organized the<br />\nphysics department to concentrate on research. Soon, the<br />\nHopkins lab was recognized by<br />\nHarvard colleagues, and described as \"far superior in all<br />\nrespects to that owned by any<br />\nAmerican university, and indeed, in the subject of electricity, larger and better than any<br />\nuniversity in Europe has in its<br />\npossession.\"<br />\nRowland's first experiment<br />\nat Hopkins involved the mechanical equivalent of heat. His<br /><br />\n\u2022<br />\n,4<br /><br />\nitrategy lc ate the production<br />\nof large and rapid rises in the<br />\ntemperature of the water, there<br />\nby reducing the uncertainty<br />\ncaused by the radiation of heat<br />\nfrom the apparatus. Joule had<br />\nmeasured his constant from a<br />\n.64 degree Celsius increase per<br />\nhour, while Rowland achieved<br />\ntemperature rises of up to 35<br />\ndegrees ner hour.<br />\nRowland was an outstanding<br />\nphysicist that history has ignored. His first approach to<br />\nconquering a new problem was<br />\nalways to build a new apparatus. He once commented that<br />\nhe had never seen a machine<br />\nwhose function he could not<br />\nimmediately comprehend.<br />\nConcerning his teaching<br />\nability at Hopkins, Rowland<br />\nwas once asked what he intended to do with his students. He<br />\nstated, \"Do with them? Do<br />\nwith them? Why, I shall neglect<br />\nthem, of course!\" Along the<br />\nsame lines, one of his students<br />\ncommented that \"To be neglected by Rowland...was more<br />\nstimulating and inspiring than<br />\nthe closest personal supervision<br />\nof lesser men.\"<br /><br />\nSymp Poses Simple Energy Question<br />\nBY ANDREW HURLEY<br />\nFour experts in their respective fields, a geophysicist, an<br />\neconomist, a lawyer and a<br />\nscientific journalist, were posed the question, \"Has the<br />\nenergy shortage passed?\" at an<br />\nenergy symposium held at<br />\nHomewood on January 10 and<br />\n11. Four very different answers<br />\nmerged.<br />\nGeophysicist S. Fred Singer<br />\nbegan the discussion by asserting that while many energy problems persist, much of the talk<br />\nabout an energy crisis is overstated. Singer argued that<br />\nthreats of foreign embargoes<br />\nare ineffectual because they<br />\n\"hardly ever work.\" He also<br />\nminimized the power of OPEC<br />\nby pointing out that rather than<br />\nsetting the price of oil, they<br />\nmerely ratify the price established by the international free<br />\nmarket.<br />\nYet, even allowing for continued price hikes, Singer maintained that substitution of<br />\ncheaper fuels would mitigate<br />\nany hardship. \"Nearly twothirds of the world's oil can be<br />\nreplaced by other sources which<br />\nare becoming cheaper,\" he<br />\nnoted.<br />\nAccording to Singer, the sudden tripling of petroleum prices<br />\nduring 1979-80 killed off a large<br />\nportion of the oil market. For<br />\nheat and steam production, it is<br />\nnow more economical to use<br />\nnatural gas, coal or nuclear<br />\nenergy, which he says is very<br />\ncheap to produce once construction costs are out of the<br />\nway. Singer believes future oil<br />\nddemand may decrease as auto-<br /><br />\nmobile efficiency increases and<br />\nas natural gas, alcohol and<br />\nmethanol become feasible trans<br />\nportation fuels. New technologies may also serve to lower<br />\nthe cost of alternate fuels, such<br />\nas coal. Singer even went as far<br />\nas to predict in the discussion<br />\ndraft he submitted that more<br />\nthan half of the world's oil<br />\nresources will remain underground.<br />\nPhilip Abelson, editor of<br />\nScience Magazine, also offered<br />\nhis projections on the domestic<br />\nenergy outlook. While Abelson<br />\npredicted that over the next<br />\nthree years oil prices would<br />\ndecline, the long-term trend will<br />\nbe upward.<br />\nEnergy economist Hans<br />\nLandsberg, however, presented<br />\na much gloomier forecast.<br />\nLandsburg expressed particular<br />\nconcern about the period between five and twenty years<br />\nfrom now. During these years,<br />\nas oil and gas supplies continue<br />\nto deplete and the expense of<br />\nextraction rises, a transformation of the nation's energy consumption patterns will become<br />\nnecessary. Yet, he fears that<br />\nsuch a transition will be<br />\ndifficult.<br />\nLandsberg's worries stem<br />\nfrom the federal government's<br />\nrecent withdrawal of funds for<br />\nresearch and development,<br />\nwhich he believes will not be<br />\npicked up by the private sector,<br />\nthe lengthy lead times generally associated with supply projects, the environmental problems associated with coal and<br />\nnuclear energy production, and<br />\nthe absence of a feasible oil<br />\n:substitute for transportation<br /><br />\nfuel.<br />\nJust as the panelists offered<br />\ndissimilar forecasts, they presented different explanations<br />\nfor past energy problems.<br />\nSinger, who currently works at<br />\nthe Heritage Foundation, placed the blame for previous<br />\nenergy crises squarely on the<br />\nshoulders of the federal government. Meddling in the marketplace only served to make<br />\nthings worse, he argued. \"For<br />\nexample,\" Singer wrote of the<br />\n1979 shortage in his discussion<br />\ndraft,\"in Maryland, the data<br />\nshowed much gasoline being used in beach resorts during the<br />\nsummer, and that's how the<br />\ngovernment allocated the gasoline. But,\" he added, \"drivers<br />\nwere afraid of leaving the city<br />\nfor fear of not being able to<br />\nfind gasoline for their return<br />\njourney.\" It was therefore, said<br />\nSinger, \"the misguided allocation efforts...that caused the<br />\ngasoline lines.\"<br />\nSinger's assessment of the<br />\nproper role of government was<br />\nattacked by Landsberg, who<br />\nargued that steps need to be<br />\ntaken to reduce inequities that<br />\nenergy shortages exacerbate.<br />\nThe seminar's final speaker<br />\nwas Stuart Eizenstat, a former<br />\n:White House advisor during the<br />\nCarter administration. His presentation focused on government's inability to develop a<br />\nconsistent and coordinated<br />\nenergy program.<br />\nThe two-day conference,<br />\nwhich focused on energy challenges for the Middle Atlantic<br />\nstates, was sponsored by the<br />\nEnergy Research Institute, bass ed at Hopkins.<br /><br />\nTrue TV Confessions<br /><br />\nLondon<br />\nBY HARRIS B.

She did<br />\nleave a note<br />\nsaying, \"Your<br />\nkid's a brat.<br />\nWho needs the<br />\n$3.75 anyway?\"<br />\nMy parents<br />\ncame<br />\nhome to<br />\nfind me<br /><br />\nthoroughly engrossed in<br />\nThe Patty Duke Show.<br />\nThey were mad at the babysitter, but<br />\nglad that they had finally found a cheap<br />\nway to keep me entertained when they<br />\nwent out. They would just put me in my<br />\nplaypen, place a few clean diapers and<br />\na bottle of juice in a corner, and say,<br />\n\"Have fun, kid.\" I didn't mind. I learned how to change my own diapers by<br />\nwatching Pampers commercials.<br />\nThe folks were thrilled. So thrilled, in<br />\nfact, that they gave me a remote control<br />\ncolor TV for my third birthday.

I said, \"assistant producer<br />\nof WJM News in Minneapolis.\" Ms.<br />\nTurner asked, \"Why don't you shoot<br />\nfor the top?

Peo-<br /><br />\nple would laugh if they found out what<br />\na TV kid I really was. They'd kick me<br />\nout of school. I deferred my admission<br />\nand went to a community college in Cincinnati for a year. I lived at home,<br />\nwatched TV, and got straight A's. I<br />\ncame to Hopkins as a transfer sophomore.<br />\nI moved into Wolman Hall, anxious<br />\nto begin apartment living. I was a bit<br />\nworried about my new housemates\u2014I<br />\ndidn't know how they would react to my<br />\nbeing a TV kid and all. I devised a plan.<br />\nI couldn't let them know that I had a<br />\ntelevision in my room, so I put one TV<br />\nin the living room. They were kind of<br />\nshocked at first. When they asked why<br />\non earth I had brought a television to<br />\nHopkins, I casually<br /><br />\nsaid, \"Oh that?

They just shrugged their shoulders<br />\nand went back to ignoring me. They<br />\naren't too bright.<br />\nThen\u2014here comes the tricky part-1<br />\nhide my second television in my bedroom, under the bed. After class (and<br />\noften before), I come home and bolt my<br />\nbedroom door. It's sanctuary for the TV<br />\nkid. I keep the sound down very low.<br />\nEven so, my roomates think I talk to<br />\nmyself. They can't figure out why I<br />\nspend so much time in my room. I told<br />\nthem I have chronic mono and I have<br />\nto sleep a lot. They really aren't very<br />\nbright.<br /><br />\nwant to<br />\npeople about<br />\nreal me, but<br />\nafraid they<br />\nstop taking<br />\nseriously...\"<br /><br />\ntell<br />\nthe<br />\nI'm<br />\nwill<br />\nme<br /><br />\nA typical day for me goes like this. I<br />\nwake up to the last fifteen minutes of<br />\nGood Morning America. While David<br />\nHartman finishes his spiel, I shower. I<br />\nhave my breakfast with Phil Donahue.<br /><br />\nDuring the commercials I do my Spanish<br />\nhomework, and if there's time, the<br />\ndishes. At ten, I scamper off to Spanish,<br />\nwondering what Mario Thomas has got<br />\nthat I haven't. I always schedule a class<br />\nbetween ten and eleven. There isn't<br />\nmuch on except for game shows, and I<br />\ndon't watch those. That's one thing I'm<br />\nfirm about. Even a TV kid has to have<br />\nsome principles. I eat lunch at eleven,<br />\nduring The Love Boat. I used to eat my<br />\nlunch later in the day, but it's hard to<br />\nwatch the Captain and Julie and Gopher<br />\ngorge themselves with food and drink<br />\nwithout getting hungry yourself.<br />\nSometimes I manage to read a couple of<br />\nchapters for school during the show. It<br />\ndepends on which episode it is. For instance, I've seen the one with Ethel Merman thirty-seven times, so I have no<br />\nqualms about watching with just half an<br />\near.<br />\nLast semester I stayed home from<br />\ntwelve to one and went to class from one<br />\nto two. That was a mistake. I like Oprah<br />\nWinfrey, but I can't take Joe Carcionne\u2014my green grocer. All he ever<br />\ndid was hold up vegetables and tell his<br />\nviewer's to eat them,. Once he held up<br />\na turnip and said, \"Folks, this is a great<br />\nvegeTAble.\" He didn't give us one<br />\nhint as to what one actually does<br />\nwith a turnip, but he did say that<br />\nit's very nutritious. You can also<br />\nfreeze them.<br />\nThis semester I'm playing<br />\nit smart: Class from twelve<br />\nto one, All My Children<br />\nfrom one to two. It's the<br />\nonly soap opera I really<br />\nfollow. Except for GH.<br />\nLate afternoon is<br />\na blur. Sesame Street<br />\n(I'm getting a teaching<br />\ncertificate),<br />\nCharlie's<br />\nAngels,<br />\nM*A*S*H, One Day at a Time. Then<br />\nit's time for dinner. Dinner with Dan.<br />\nI watch The CBS Evening News with<br />\nDan Rather out in the living room. I<br />\neven coaxed one of my roommates into<br />\nwatching it once. I don't think she liked it though, she said it was too<br />\ndepressing.<br />\n1 study from seven to nine. The nine<br />\no'clock prime time shows serve as terrific incentives for studying, especially<br />\nthe ABC Wednesday Movie of the<br />\nWeek. It's always a doozy.<br />\nMy favorite show is on at eleven\u2014<br />\nSoap. I like to pretend that I'm one of<br />\nthe Tates. I think Jessica would make<br />\na terrific mother, but I wouldn't want<br />\nto get stuck with Chester (or Jessica's<br />\nchest for that matter). Chuck and Bob<br />\nare very funny. Chuck's a person and<br />\nBob's a dummy, but they both wear the<br />\nsame clothes so it's hard to tell them<br />\napart. The show is great because each<br />\nepisode picks up where the last one left<br />\noff. It's kind of like a soap opera.<br />\nI try to watch David Letterman every<br />\nnight. Most people don't know this, but<br />\nLate Night is very educational. I never<br />\nknew anything about Staten Island or<br />\nthe Bronx until I watched his show. He<br />\ngives guided tours.<br />\nI've watched his show for sixty-seven<br />\nnights in a row. I'm shooting for<br />\nseventy-three. I want to marry David<br />\nLetterman. I figure if I could say,<br />\n\"David, I've watched your show every<br />\nnight for seventy-three straight nights,\"<br />\nhe'd have to take me seriously.<br />\nThat's the problem. I want to tell people about the real me, but I'm afraid<br />\nthey will stop taking me seriously,<br />\nespecially Hopkins people. If only they<br />\nknew how exciting it is to be a TV kid.<br />\nI go to bed with David\u2014wake up with<br />\nPhil. It's not a bad life after all.<br /><br />\nAt first glance, the London School<br />\nof Economics does not seem to be a<br />\nvery imposing sort of place. Instead<br />\nof the acres and acres of green grass,<br />\nshiny new buildings and Georgian architecture one becomes accustomed<br />\nto at Hopkins, the LSE consists<br />\nmainly of five or six dirty high-rise<br />\nbuildings tucked away on a crowded<br />\nlittle street next to one of London's<br />\nbusiest intersections. Yet for all that<br />\nthe LSE lacks in lawns and construction dust, it more than makes up for<br />\nit in atmosphere and personality.<br />\nOne of the first things one notices<br />\nabout the LSE is the high level of<br />\npolitical activism in the student body.<br />\nMy year there included an almost<br />\ncontinuous stream of strikes, protest<br />\nmeetings and demonstrations over a<br />\nwide variety of issues, ranging from<br />\ndomestic transport and education<br />\npolices to U.S. intervention in El<br />\nSalvador, Chile and South Africa.<br />\nThough most seemed to think that<br />\nactivism was greatly reduced from<br />\nwhat it had been in the past, it was<br />\nstill a marked contrast to Hopkins.<br />\nOne only has to remember the controversy two years ago, when the<br />\nJ HU Student Council passed a resolution condemning U.S. actions in El<br />\nSalvador. The resultant uproar might<br />\nhave discouraged even the most<br />\nhardened activist from attempting to<br />\nmake any sort of political statement<br />\nin the council.<br />\nThe LSE Student Union, on the<br />\nother hand, regularly called meetings<br />\nsolely for political reasons, often to<br />\nsend letters, petitions and telegrams<br />\nto political leaders. Not only was this<br />\naccepted, but protest only erupted<br />\nafter the union voted to donate<br />\nseveral hundred pounds to what some<br />\nalleged was a South African terrorist<br />\norganization. Another union act involved the establishment of a scholarship fund for a black South African<br /><br />\nMore Exciting Than Baltimore: Surprised?<br />\nstudent to attend the LSE\u2014something unheard of at Hopkins, where<br />\nSpring Fair committees spend $3000<br />\non \"pizza and other inducements.\"<br />\nIn fact, LSE and other British universities have something remotely similar<br />\nto the Spring Fair called \"Rag<br />\nWeek\" (the main similarity is that<br />\nthey both occur in the spring), but all<br />\nof the activity profits from Rag<br />\nWeek are donated to charity.<br />\nThough much of the political activity at the LSE was probably<br /><br />\nfutile\u2014the second time you picket the<br />\nU.S. embassy they stop noticing\u2014<br />\nLSE students can be said to have<br />\nmuch more of a world view than<br />\nHopkins students do.(It is true that<br />\nthe Progressive Student Union at<br />\nHopkins has made great deal of progress in making students politically<br />\naware, however, there still seems a<br />\nlong way to go.)<br />\nIndeed, one of the most important<br />\nthings that one learns at the LSE is<br />\nthat there is a world out there. At<br />\nsome point, I was told that the LSE<br />\nhas students from over 90 countries\u2014you meet and talk to people<br />\nwho have markedly different backgrounds and outlooks, rather than<br />\nthe middle-class existence that most<br />\nat Hopkins seem to share. Students<br />\nwill be facing and trying to solve real<br />\nproblems when they return home;<br />\nLSE always likes to boast about the<br />\nnumber of its graduates who are currently prime ministers\u2014If I remember correctly, the total was 15 when<br />\nI was there.<br />\nPerhaps this sounds too idealistic,<br />\nand in a way it is, because the LSE<br />\nhas a great many \"career-oriented\"<br />\nstudents(the IBM and Citicorp tables<br />\nat career day were mobbed.) But<br />\nmany students\u2014many more than one<br />\never sees here\u2014seem genuinely dedicated and interested in what they<br />\nare studying.<br />\nThere is more to the LSE however,<br />\nthan simply the acquisition of a<br />\npolitical awareness. The school excels<br />\nin economics, offering close to two<br />\nhundred separate courses in the subject. Though the school has some<br />\nfinancial trouble and extracurricular<br />\nactivities are somewhat limited, people tend to substitute enthusiasm and<br />\nspirit for the money rieded. The LSE<br />\ndrama club for example, never had<br />\na budget over $300 for any of its productions, and yet managed to present<br />\nseveral well-performed plays, including one which was awarded \"Best<br />\nProduction\" at the University of<br />\nLondon drama festival.<br />\nThe LSE has other problems, however. Beyond economics and a dozen<br /><br />\nor so related topics (political science,<br />\ninternational studies, economic history, etc.) the school's offerings are<br />\nvery thin\u2014no physical or biological<br />\nsciences, little literature or languages.<br />\nand offerings by other departments<br />\ntend to be very uneven. The history<br />\ndepartment, for example, offers<br />\n15-20 survey-type courses and a<br />\nhandful of incredibly obscure topics.<br />\n(My favorite course title was \"War,<br />\nRevolution and Intervention in the<br />\nIberian Peninsula 1808-54.\" The<br /><br />\nschool also labors under what can only be described as a very peculiar<br />\nevaluation system. Unlike our continuous evaluation system (quizzes,<br />\ntests, papers, semester grades, etc.)<br />\nmost LSE students take year-long<br />\ncourses where the only grade received is that for the final exam. Most<br />\ncourses generally have two papers<br />\nassigned per term, but while graded,<br />\nthese do not generally count towards<br />\nthe final grade, except in borderline<br />\ncases. Foreign students have the option of not taking exams, but are<br />\ngenerally assigned more class work to<br />\nmake up for it. Even so, it is quite a<br />\nfascinating sight in late May to watch<br />\npeople try and recall things they<br />\nlearned the previous September, and<br />\nattempting to cram a year's worth of<br />\nknowledge into a three-hour exam.<br />\nStrange as this may sound, I think I<br />\nprefer mid-terms and problem sets.<br />\nAnother, more serious problem at<br />\nthe LSE is a severe budget crisis that<br />\nthe school is facing. Though the<br />\nschool did not seem to be too seriously affected by fiscal problems last<br />\nyear, there were continuous rumors<br />\nof departmental cutbacks and closures, which may ultimately do serious damage to the quality of education at the school.<br /><br />\nDespite all this, probably the best<br />\npart about the LSE is that it is located<br />\nin London, which is an incredibly interesting and beautiful city. It's like<br />\na vast cultural warehouse waiting to<br />\nbe sifted through\u2014$5 theater tickets,<br />\ntremendous art galleries, the best<br />\nrock-and-roll clubs in the world\u2014it's<br />\nan endlessly fascinating place. On the<br />\nsurface, London does appear to be<br />\nimpersonal and tourist-ridden, but if<br />\none takes the time to explore the side<br />\nstreets, stop for tea and crumpets in<br />\nCovent Garden, or just lie out on the<br />\ngrass in Regent's Park, it becomes<br />\ndifficult not to love it.<br />\nTwo problems with London are<br />\nthe weather and the cost. It seems to<br />\nbe raining three-fourths of the time<br />\nyou're there (except when it's snowing). London and the LSE prove to<br />\nbe a very expensive proposition\u2014<br />\nprobably a total of $11,000 vs.<br />\n$8-9000 at Hopkins, with no financial aid available, though you can get<br />\nloans for foreign study. Housing,<br />\nespecially centrally located places,<br />\ncan be very expensive and difficult to<br />\nfind. I ended up spending my life's<br />\nsavings and I'm still heavily in debt<br />\nto my parents, but my year was quite<br />\nworthwhile, something I'd do again<br />\nwithout hesitation.<br /><br />\nHere Is What the Gazette Does<br />\nBY CATHERINE RAEFF<br />\nTo some it is boring, to others informative. It is the Johns Hopkins Gazette<br />\nwhich is published weekly by the Office of Publications under the editorship<br />\nof Robert Hewes and the editorial<br />\nassistance of Billie Walker.<br />\nThe idea of the Gazette was proposed by University President Dr. Steven<br />\nMuller when he came to Hopkins in<br />\n1971. Hewes says, \"Muller thought it<br />\nwould be a good idea to have a regular<br />\npublication circulate among the divisions of the University to improve communication.\" He also proposed that<br />\nthere be a calendar of events for different institutions within the University. Since the first issue was published on<br />\nSeptember 1, 1971, the Gazette has remained the only official publication<br />\njoining all the University divisions,<br />\nwhich include the Peabody Institute,<br />\nSAIS, the Applied Physics Lab, the<br />\nMedical School and the Homewood<br />\nCampus.<br />\nDuring the first year of publication,<br />\nthe Gazette editors used the NewsLetter's typesetting equipment. Since its<br />\nsecond year, the Gazette has been<br />\ntypeset off-campus. The paste-up is<br />\ndone in its own offices and sent to the<br />\nprinter from there.<br />\nThe goal of the Gazette was originally, and still is, to improve communications among the different divisions of<br />\nthe University. Each week Hewes and<br />\nWalker \"collect\" the official announcements, policy statements and news releases in the public relations offices of<br />\nthe various divisions. They then put<br />\nthem together to form the Gazette. The<br />\nnotes and minutes of the academic councils are also published to enable the<br />\nvarious faculties to know what is being<br />\ndiscussed among the other faculties.<br />\nBecause it is a collection of University<br />\nstatements, there are no original reporters and there is no editorial board. As<br />\nHewes said, \"It is a very straightforward<br />\noperation.\"<br />\nStudent opinion of the Gazette is<br />\nbasically one of apathy. Hewes and<br />\nWalker realize \"that the information [itl<br /><br />\ncontains is not interesting to students\" Gazette is published each week of the<br />\nand that it is more relevant to the facul- academic year and four times during<br />\nty and administrators. They do feel, June and July. Although the June and<br />\nhowever, that the Gazette is \"the com- July issues are missing from Martin's<br />\nmon denominator for all associated\" collection, he will have amassed a total<br />\nwith the University. The Gazette does of 136 issues by the time he graduates.<br />\nkeep abreast of student affairs, such as Martin feels that \"The Gazette is helpful<br />\nthe Spring Fair, and it welcomes student in integrating all institutions of the<br />\ninput at any time.<br />\nUniversity. One would have to obtain<br />\nWalker said that the Gazette \"is easy and read all the papers of each into pick up and read.\" This seems to dividual institution to get the same<br />\nserve as both an advantage and a disad- knowledge.\" Martin particularly likes<br />\nvantage for the Gazette. Because of its the weekly calendar of events. He did,<br />\nbrevity, many students do not even however, have some constructive cribother reading it and consequently do ticisms to offer. He wishes that the<br />\nnot realize its value. On the other hand, Academic Council notes were more up<br />\nmany read the entire paper cover to to date. This section is very important<br />\ncover in one sitting because it is short since \"it gives a rundown of the<br />\nand direct.<br />\nHomewood AC notes, and that is where<br />\nWhen I asked students around cam- the decisions of the Hopkins underpus what they thought of the Gazette, graduates are made.\" Martin also finds<br />\nmany replied,\"Oh, I don't know. I only that \"sometimes the headline story is<br />\nread it once.\" One freshman finds it too sensationalistic.\"<br />\n\"boring.\" Another young lady said,<br />\nThough it is only four pages (unless<br />\n\"Occasionally the articles interest me,<br />\nbut not usually.\" Many students admit- a major document is printed to make it<br />\nted its value in bringing out the news of eight pages), the Gazette is a profesthe various institutions, but did not feel sional publication.

While there is no scientific app .oach to landing a summer job, there are basics<br />\ntat can give the job seeker a competitive<br />\nadvantage.<br /><br />\nIt's been a subtle change, but during<br />\n1982, unknown groups such as the<br />\nHuman League, A Flock of Seagulls<br />\nand Men at Work cracked the hallowed<br />\nTop 40, and \"new wave,\" only five<br />\nyears old, won over. Never accuse the<br />\npublic of being slow. But \"new wave\"<br />\nis no longer new, and neither may it be<br />\ncalled a wave. New wave, by 1983, consists of a series of fragments\u2014rockabilly<br />\nrevival, skanking ska, hammering hardcore, bloated blitz\u2014and most notably<br />\nthe purveyors of dance music for the<br />\n'80s. It is this dance music that has most<br />\nfrequently captured the mid-American<br />\nimagination: the titter-tatter of synths,<br />\nsome shimmering guitar, patently<br />\ncopied black funk bass lines, the steady<br />\ndrum beat call to the dance floor, and<br />\nsome dispassionate vocals on a passionate subject. It tends to move, but<br />\noften in a sterile, antiseptic way. You<br />\ncan dance to \"I Ran\" or \"Don't You<br />\nWant Me,\" but why listen to them at<br />\nhome?<br />\nThat's where the Simple Minds come<br />\nin. New Gold Dream (81-82-83-84)is as<br />\nwarm as it is danceable, as enjoyable on<br />\nyour stereo alone as at Girard's with<br />\nyour loved one. The title track sums it<br />\nup best: a steady, propulsive drum beat<br />\nwith lots of cymbal work and a subtle,<br />\nmoving bass line set the frame on which<br />\nto hang synthesizer washes and guitar<br />\nlines that float in and out like whippedcream clouds. The music may be pure<br />\nconfection, but it's puzzling in its<br />\ndepth\u2014there's just so much to listen to.<br /><br />\n3 EASY STEPS TO LANDING A SUMMER JOB<br />\nis a complete guide which tells where the jobs are<br />\nand how to land them.

Unfortunately, his frightening and touching Wings, as produced by Center Stage, gives the viewer an<br />\nevening of possibilities, strong but<br />\nseldom realized.<br />\nThe play opens with a homey scene,<br />\nas Emily Stilson (Bette Henritze) sits<br />\nreading comfortably in her living room<br />\nchair. She suffers a stroke, and what<br />\nfollows is her internal alienation from<br />\nthe melange of mental and physical<br />\nstimuli that her mind cannot quite synthesize. Periods of Faulknerian train of<br />\nthought keep the spectator reeling. Going through moments of oblivious and<br />\noften ecstatic or agonizing alienation,<br />\nEmily communicates the difficulty of<br />\nher plight\u2014or rather Kopit does\u2014<br />\nthrough extended analogy. Especially<br />\nintriguing is the ambiguous ending: does<br />\nshe die?<br />\nDespite the power of the subject,<br />\nWings never quite gets off the ground.<br />\nOriginally written for radio, the production makes use of the recorded word, an<br />\ninnovation marred by a hollow sound<br />\nsystem. Distortion and the electronic<br />\n.music at the end (reminiscent of<br />\nChariots ofFire but less than inspiring)<br />\nalso detract from the performances on<br />\nstage, which is another subject<br />\naltogether.<br />\nThe supporting roles here are inadequate at best. Keeping in mind that this<br />\nis basically a one-woman show, it seems<br />\nthat little care was given to casting the<br />\nmajority of the remaining roles. Chris-<br /><br />\ntopher McLann, as Billy, was a remarkable and relieving standout. Daniel<br />\nSzelag and Joanne Manley as two of the<br />\ndoctors who attempt to communicate<br />\nwith Emily portray the cold helplessness<br />\nof their positions\u2014on the outside looking in.<br />\nExhibiting a smooth and grandmotherly voice, Henritze underplays<br />\nEmily Stilson. Her credits and previous<br />\nperformances are impressive, but she is<br />\nout of her element in this type of role.<br />\nIt demands a dynamic, erratic quality<br />\nthat she simply cannot produce. She<br />\ndoes carry more than her weight during<br />\nthe warmer and more touching scenes.<br />\nwith her therapist, Amy (Phyllis Somerville in a disturbingly unfeeling performance), but her delivery of the monologues is not gripping enough; her words<br />\nflow too easily past the audience, become jumbled and lost.<br />\nWhat perhaps saves the show is the<br />\nremarkable set design, and the way<br />\ndirector Stan Wojewodski conducts the<br />\nactors within it. The set captures the<br />\nseparation experienced by Emily, embodied in a series of reflecting partitions<br />\nand boxes that are always in motion. At<br />\nseveral points during the performance,<br />\nthe doctors address one of Emily's many<br />\nreflections or shadows; they cannot<br />\nreach her (\"Is there anything you<br />\nneed?\" asks a nurse. \"A sweater<br />\nplease,\" says Emily. The nurse brings<br />\nher a pillow). The audience, too, is forced to acknowledge its position as a spectator, as it can see its own reflection<br />\nlooking in from the walls that enclose<br />\nEmily, walls that come to symbolize her<br />\nimpenetrability.<br />\nIt is a shame that a play which means<br /><br />\nNEWS-LETTER/PAGE 13<br /><br />\nCreating Sounds You Never Noticed Before<br />\nTopped by Jim Kerr's dubbed and poppish \"Glittering Prize,\" voted most \u2022<br />\nredubbed vocals, it's a musical sundae likely to go Top 40, the keyboard virof numerous flavors and toppings.

Prior<br />\nto the winter break, the Jays<br />\nwere 2-2 overall, but a combination of sluggish first halves,<br /><br />\nly, only scoring 25 points to<br />\nGeorgian Court's 39. Plagued<br />\nwith foul violations, Hopkins<br />\nseemed unable to put their<br />\ngame together. Yet, in the second half, the Jays quickened<br />\ntheir pace, managed to outscore<br />\ntheir opponent and close the<br />\ngap to 54-50 with four minutes<br />\nremaining. But they were unable to retain their driving<br /><br />\n'Dawn Richards puts it up.<br /><br />\nmany fouls and minor injuries<br />\nslowed them down to their present 4-8 record. Optimism,<br />\nthough, does remain; despite a<br />\nprevious loss to Georgian<br />\nCourt, 65-54 on January 28, the<br />\nJays rallied to beat top-ranked<br />\nShepherd 72-69 on January 31.<br />\nTheir game last Friday<br />\nagainst Georgain Court opened<br />\ntypically for the Jays. During<br />\nthe first half they moved slow-<br /><br />\npower in the final minutes<br />\nagainst the strong attack and<br />\neffective defense of Georgian<br />\nCourt, and because of this, the<br />\nJays were held at a score of 54<br />\nwhile Georgian Court finished<br />\nthe game with 65 points.<br />\nDespite the loss, the Jays'<br />\nteam members had a few shining moments. Dawn Richards,<br />\nwho was consistently excellent<br />\nin both her defense and of-<br /><br />\nfense, poured in the game high<br />\nscore of 30 points. Geraldine<br />\nKlauber, however, seemed to be<br />\nhurt by foul trouble as she only scored six points, ten below<br />\nher season average. Amy Buchanan, another strong player,<br />\nscored 12 points, and excelled<br />\nin rebounding.<br />\nThese three players starred<br />\nagain in leading the Jays to victory over Shepherd on January<br />\n31. Unlike many of their other<br />\ngames, Hopkins began the first<br />\nhalf aggressively, outscoring<br />\nShepherd 40-32 by making 42<br />\npercent of their shots. Yet the<br />\nJays did not walk away with the<br />\ngame, as Shepherd gave them a<br />\nscare in the second half by<br />\noutscoring Hopkins 37-32.<br />\nHopkins, though, held their<br />\nown against the onslaught to<br />\nwin 72-69 after the tense final<br />\nminutes.<br />\nAs usual, Dawn Richards<br />\nwas the leading scorer with a<br />\ncareer high of 31 points.<br />\nGeraldine Klauber followed her<br />\nin scoring with 14 points, but<br />\nagain she was hampered by<br />\nfouls, especially in the second<br />\nhalf. Amy Buchanan had an exceptionally good game, scoring<br />\n13 points and grabbing 16 rebounds. She, as well as Joan<br />\nBartlett, hit important free<br />\nthrow situations toward the end<br />\nof the game. According to<br />\nCoach Kay Fowler, this was the<br />\nbest game of Amy Buchanan's<br />\nseason, and the best women's<br />\nbasketball game she has seen<br />\nplayed by Hopkins in two<br />\nyears.<br />\nThe victory over Shepherd<br />\nhas given the Jays the support<br />\nthat they need to continue the<br />\nstruggle against many strong<br />\nopponents. Coach Fowler feels<br />\nthat, \"We finally have our act<br />\ntogether. I had toughened their<br />\nschedule in comparison to last<br />\nyear's opponents, so they have<br />\nbeen, and will be, playing<br />\nagainst tough opposition. Now<br />\nI am looking forward to playing against Western Maryland,<br />\nHood and Swarthmore next<br />\nweek.\" Traditional rival Western Maryland, whom the Jays<br />\nwill be hosting on Monday at<br />\n7:00, beat the Jays last year by<br />\nonly one point. Coach Fowler<br />\nand her team now feel confident that they will be able to<br />\nplay good, close games against<br />\ntheir opposition in their upcoming contests.<br /><br />\nWomen Squash Swarthmore<br />\nBY JOHN BEVILACQUA<br />\nThe Hopkins women's squash<br />\nteam convincingly won its<br />\nseason opener on Friday, topping Swarthmore 6-1 in a best<br />\nof seven match.<br />\nHaving lost last year's top<br />\nthree players to graduation,<br />\nfirst-year Coach Eric Dressler<br />\nhas a very young squad of 12,<br />\nwith few seniors. Despite their<br />\nyouth and the fact that none of<br />\nthe players have ever played<br />\nhigher than fourth seed before,<br />\nthe Jays trounced Swarthmore,<br />\n6-1, with only their seventh seed<br /><br />\nlosing. Their next match will be<br />\nTuesday night at Franklin and<br />\nMarshall.<br />\nThe highlight of their very<br />\nshort season is the Howe Cup<br />\nTournament at Yale, February<br />\n11-13. About 30 teams compete<br />\nin the tournament that is divided into three brackets. Last<br />\nyear, the Hopkins women were<br />\nplaced in the second bracket<br />\nand did not fare very well. This<br />\nyear, however, they are in the<br />\nthird bracket where Coach Dressler feels the \"women will be<br />\nfar more competitive.\"<br />\nThe top players for Coach<br /><br />\nDressler are captain Kathy<br />\nChou, Jessie Chai, Gail Penny<br />\nand Ann Harnwell, with Chai<br />\nbeing their number-one seed. In<br />\npast years, Hopkins has been<br />\ncompetitive with Middle Atlantic Conference foes Swarthmore<br />\nand F&amp;M. They have had considerably less success against<br />\nDivision I and Ivy League<br />\nrivals.

On Saturday,<br />\nthe team met MAC rival Susquehanna, and lost a close<br />\nmatch, 28-21. On Tuesday, tl-K<br />\nJays were dominated by Rutgers-Camden and York, with<br />\nfinal scores of 32-6 and 55-0,<br />\nrespectively.<br />\nThe Susquehanna match saw<br />\nstrong performances by several<br />\nwrestlers. Lee Wagstaff at 142,<br />\nRich Grohol at 177 and Steve<br />\nTristani at heavyweight all<br />\nscored pins against their opponents. Wagstaff showed fine<br />\ncontrol, scoring the fall at 2:40,<br />\nand not allowing his opponent<br />\na single point. Grohol decked<br />\nhis man at 1:03, while Tristani<br />\nneeded only 42 seconds to<br />\nsecure the pin. The remaining<br />\nteam points were scored by Has<br />\nFranklin at 190, who edged out<br />\na 13-12 decision.<br /><br />\nMissed opportunities, however, caused the Jays' downfall.<br />\nNick Perrin, at 150, scored a<br />\nnear fall and came within three<br />\npoints before being pinned<br />\nhimself at 5:59. Eddie Brown,<br />\nat 126, tied his match with a<br />\nreversal with less than a minute<br />\nleft, only to have his opponent<br />\nturn the tables again with 13<br />\nseconds remaining to score a<br />\n8-6 win. \"We could have won,<br />\nshould have won,\" admitted<br />\nCoach John Kohler. \"Any<br />\nsingle bout can make the match<br />\ngo one way or another.\"<br />\nThe Jays went into Tuesday's<br />\ntri-meet against experienced<br />\nYork and Rutgers-Camden<br />\nwith some apprehension, and<br />\nleft with a lot of frustration.<br />\nThe grapplers first fell to<br />\nRutgers-Camden, 34-6. Only<br />\nWagstaff and Grohol could<br />\nmanage to score decisions,<br />\nWagstaff by a 5-3 tally, and<br />\nGrohol by an 8-1 margin.

The Jay swordsmen's present mark of six wins<br />\nand two losses appears, once<br />\nagain, to herald a successful<br />\n1983 Middle Atlantic Conference season. Nevertheless,<br />\none cannot help ' but think<br />\nabout a comment somebody<br />\nhad made about last year's 11-3<br />\nrecord: \"mediocre.\" Might this<br />\n1983 season simply be labeled<br />\na \"mediocre\" one for Hopkins<br />\nfencing? Perhaps, but if you<br />\ntake this year's circumstances<br />\ninto account, \"mediocre\" does<br />\nnot quite seem the appropriate<br />\nword.<br />\nThe conference season started quickly with a week-long<br />\nroad trip to northern New<br />\nJersey and the surrounding<br />\nvicinity, and has slowed to a<br />\nsomewhat more reasonable<br />\npace after Intersession. So far,<br />\nthe Jays have defeated SUNY<br />\nMaritime (19-8), Baruch<br />\n(14-13), Hunter (15-12), St.<br />\nPeter's(15-12), Trinity (16-11),<br />\nand the New Jersey Institute of<br />\nTechnology (17-10). Their only two losses came at the hands<br />\nof Lafayette (16-11) and<br />\nWilliam Paterson (14-13).<br />\nPart of the problem with this<br />\nyear's team is a lack of experience in a large fraction of<br />\nthe team. Many varsity fencers<br />\nare new, filling the ranks of<br />\nseniors who graduated or injured fencers. Of the 15 varsity<br />\nstarters, only seven have had<br />\npast varsity experience: epeeists<br />\nRoger Blauvelt and Pat Havens, sabre Taro Adachi, and<br />\nfoilsmen John Tu, Dave Weiner, John Cummings and Andy Goldberg. Of those same 15,<br />\n12 are sophomores. The team,<br />\nthen, cannot be adequately<br />\njudged simply as \"mediocre\"<br />\nbut rather as \"inexperienced.\"<br />\nFoil captain John Tu believes<br />\nthat Hopkins' inexperience was<br />\na key factor in the loss to a<br />\nveteran Lafayette team. This<br /><br />\nsame basic flaw probably in- has compiled a 12-10 record,<br />\nfluenced the outcome of the while sabre captain Taro<br />\nPaterson meet.

Through<br />\nsports we gain a sense of cornraderie, self-discipline and the<br />\nability to interact within a<br />\ngroup. Thus, athletics form one<br />\nmajor aspect of our educational<br />\nsystem. The other significant<br />\nfactor within our development<br />\nis academic pursuits. These two<br />\nimportant elements in our educational process are not mutual<br />\nly exclusive, and the person<br />\nwho strives for both athletic<br />\nand academic achievement<br />\ngains a great deal from our<br />\nsociety.<br />\nEducation is not merely a<br />\nprocess begun in one day and<br />\nfinished in one month, a year,<br />\nor twenty-five years; it is a combination of factors that continually influence a person's<br />\nlife. Sports and formal schooling play major roles in our<br />\nlives. In short, from childhood<br />\nthrough college and upward,<br />\nthe sports and academic worlds<br />\nare parts of the lives of many<br />\nof us. For some, one dominates<br />\nthe other; for the lucky few,<br />\nboth live in happy coexistence.<br />\nAs children our dreams are a<br />\nsignificant part of our reality,<br />\nand this reality is filled with<br />\nsports fantasies. Many dreams<br />\nconcern the cheering crowds<br />\nwho watch you circle the bases<br />\nafter hitting the winning home<br />\nrun, or see you enter the<br />\nstadium for the marathon's<br />\nfinal stretch.
