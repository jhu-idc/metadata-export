That the System has made a<br />\nVast number of positive contributions<br />\nCan hardly be denied. The high degree<br />\nof trust between the students and the<br />\nfaculty, the atmosphere of academic<br />\nfreedom, and the maturity and responsibility of the Hopkins student all have<br />\ntheir roots in the principles of the<br />\nHonor System.<br />\nIn 1948, an Honor Commission was<br />\nCreated to perpetuate the traditions of<br />\nthe Honor System. Previously, the responsibilities for .the maintenance of<br />\nthe System rested with the faculty and<br />\nthe Student Council. The Commission<br />\n<br />\n***<br />\n<br />\nexistence. And unfortunately, many<br />\ncommission members in the past have<br />\ne<br />\nlost sight of this.<br />\nIt is, therefore, imperative that the<br />\nCommission take immediate steps to<br />\neducate the student body in the problems of the system and elicit suggestions from them. The key to increasing<br />\nstudent interest in the workings of the<br />\nCommission and the System lies in<br />\ngreater contact between the Commission members and the students.<br />\nAt the present time, the Commission<br />\nIs lacking in heterogeneity. For instance, only one member of the Commission lives in a dormitory while all<br />\nbut one were or are members of fraternities. This uneven distibution tends<br />\nto narrow discussion concerning the<br />\nCommission and the System to only a<br />\npart of the Hopkins community. The<br />\nultimate solution would be for the<br />\nCommission to consciously attempt to<br />\ngain a broad cross-section of new members when consideration of new candidates occurs at the end of the year.<br />\n<br />\nPossible Media<br />\nBut there is a much better way for<br />\nthe Commission to reach a greater part<br />\nof the community. The institution of a<br />\nseries of forums where a few commission members would answer questions<br />\nand discuss important problems that<br />\nplague the Commission would be quite<br />\neffective in inducing student interest<br />\nand discussion of the vital matters of<br />\nany particular year. In addition, certain members of the community could<br />\nbe chosen after the forums to present<br />\ntheir views at Commission meetings.<br />\nThe value of student forums at HopDAVID BUCHDAHL<br />\nkins was evident last December when<br />\napproximately fifty students came on<br />\nnot<br />\nbut<br />\nyears<br />\nhas survived for twenty<br />\na snowy afternoon before Christmas vaWithout a fair share of controversy.<br />\ncation to participate in a forum on<br />\nMuch of the criticism of the Comchanges in the curriculum.<br />\nmission has centered upon personalities<br />\nCommunication could also be greatly<br />\nand has therefore been senseless and<br />\nenhanced by the use of the Newsletter.<br />\nharmful to the System.

Hopkins students and<br />\nothers all over the country are no<br />\nlonger satisfied with just seeing films,<br />\nthey want to start making them. In<br />\ndoing so they are making new demands<br />\non the university.<br />\nMaking films is becoming one of the<br />\nmost popular, but one of the most expensive forms of expression on the<br />\ncampus. Although no one seems to<br />\nknow exactly how many films are being<br />\nmade, a New York University professor<br />\nestimates that students are cranking<br />\nout :several hundred finished films every<br />\nsemester. In terms of enrollment graduate programs in film have jumped<br />\ntremendously. N.Y.U. for example went<br />\nfrom 3 in 1960 to 110 this year, while<br />\nschools in California are turning away<br />\nalmost as many applicants as they<br />\naccept.<br />\nBut the gains aren't in quality alone.<br />\nArthur Knight, film critic of the Saturday Review and one of the judges<br />\nfor the festival says, \"Fully a third of<br />\nthe films we saw gave us a very real<br />\nsense of discovery.\" He adds that many<br />\nof the films were of near professional<br />\ntechnical quality.<br />\nUniversities Respond<br />\nUniversities, both in the east and in<br />\nthe west have been responding to this<br />\nsurge of interest in film. Yale gave one<br />\nof its students $1,500 to make a film<br />\nfor his seniors honor program. The<br />\nresult was a 42 minute film called<br />\n\"Talking of Michelangelo\" which one of<br />\nthe professors at Yale called a work<br />\nof \"exceptional distinction.\"<br />\nColumbia, the Veteran of the Ivy<br />\nLeague in film, is planning to expand<br />\ntheir program in the next few years.<br />\nHaying already spent millions of dollars to develop their program to the<br />\npoint that it has reached now, they<br />\nhave found that they will have to invest even more money, energy and<br />\nimagination to meet the growing needs.<br />\nDartmouth has a small film program<br />\nwhich they plan to enlarge. Liberal<br />\nArts students at Princeton can apply<br />\nfor free film for approved projects.<br />\nProfessors at Oberlin helped students<br />\nform a club to raise money for moviemaking. Universities up and down the<br />\neast coast, from Harvard to (we hope)<br />\nJohns Hopkins, are following the example set by the pioneers.<br />\n<br />\nequipment, but many students still<br />\nspend more than their budgets allow and<br />\nhave to pay the difference themselves.<br />\nStudents figure a movie up to 10<br />\nminutes long costs about $300 for film<br />\nand proc,essing. Where film production<br />\nisn't part of the curriculum, moviemakers have the added costs of rents<br />\ning cameras and lenses.<br />\nMajor Successes<br />\nBut despite quiet beginnings; some<br />\nstudents have achieved major successes.<br />\nTwo years ago, two Has-yard University<br />\ngraduates filmed \"Nothing But a Man\",<br />\na dramatic profile of a negro railroad<br />\nlaborer.

The great danger<br />\ninherent in such public sentiment is that it breeds frustration and frustration in turn breeds the most dangerous kind of irrationality.<br />\nSuch a national psychosis made it possible for<br />\nSenator McCarthy to use the frustrations of America's<br />\nlimited world battle with the Communists and turn them<br />\nagainst a mythical threat at home. One of the first places<br />\nhe turned to find a domestic conspiracy were the colleges and universities.<br />\nWe are all aware that our University reacted to that<br />\nthreat with courage and plain good sense. We hope that<br />\nfifteen years later the University shall still see fit to<br />\nplace a greater premium on freedom of expression than<br />\nthe banal concerns of public relations.<br />\n<br />\nToday's college students have<br />\ngrown up with the MOViCS as a<br />\nkind of cultural presence. They<br />\nhave seen them on television,<br />\nprobably front early childhood.<br />\nAnd in one sense students have<br />\ntaken them more seriousty\u2014certainly more immediately\u2014titan<br />\nother traditional arts. Movies are<br />\nTHEIR art, THEIR discovery,<br />\nand increasingly THEIR means<br />\nof expressing personal and social concerns. No other art is so<br />\nnatural and common a part of<br />\nthe texture of daily student intellectual life. A student's ratio<br />\nof films to novels may be 20 to 1;<br />\nbut although the college he attends is likely to offer more titan<br />\na dozen literature courses, it is<br />\njust as likely that he will not<br />\nyet find a single course in motion picture history or criticism<br />\nor the opportunities for directed<br />\nwork in production which can<br />\nbring him to a closer understanding of the demand and<br />\nresources of the medium. This<br />\ncircumstance s e e in s strange,<br />\nespecially when one considers<br />\nthat the number of motion pictures made in the United States<br />\nlast year was greater than the<br />\nnumber of books entered into<br />\ncopyright! Further, it reflects a<br />\nsurprising neglect of an art form<br />\nrecognized around the world<br />\nwhich the United States largely<br />\nhelped to develop as an artistic<br />\nas well as an economic phenontenon.<br />\n<br />\nSpeechless<br />\nDr. Wickwire and the Student Association are to<br />\nbe commended on their most recent effort to provide<br />\nboth speakers and discussion on current issues. The<br />\nSunday night movies and discussions to be held the next<br />\nsix weeks appear to us to be worthwhile and interesting.<br />\nWe urge students to attend these events.<br />\nIt is a shame, however, that the campus must depend on the Student Association and Dr. Wickwire for<br />\na forum on controversial topics. We can only lament the<br />\nUniversity's failure to provide the students with more<br />\nstimulus in this vital area.<br />\nMike Mansfield and Robert Weaver represent the<br />\nUniversity's first semester contribution to speakers on<br />\ncampus. Even in these cases, no attempt was made to<br />\ncoordinate these speakers into a broader program of<br />\ncampus discussion and debate on the topics presented.<br />\nNo attempt has been made to expose the students to the<br />\nopinions and ideas of knowledgeable faculty members<br />\nand fellow students. Speakers (both of them) merely<br />\ncome and go and the University is content.<br />\nWe can only hope that the University will do more<br />\nto encourage and promote free campus<br />\nsemester<br />\nthis<br />\ndiscussion on current issues. Perhaps a cue can be taken<br />\nfrom Levering, and debates be arranged between opposing viewpoints on Vietnam, the War on Poverty, Black<br />\nPower, busing, open occupancy, the Warren Report, and _<br />\nother live issues. Or seminars, open discussions, and\"<br />\nforums could be promoted.<br />\nThere are knowledgeable, interesting, and opinionated persons on campus and in the community who<br />\ncould easily be obtained and Washington is nearby. Programs can be arranged in conjunctions with speakers,<br />\nfilms, plays, concerts, or on their own.<br />\nNumerous topics, formats, and speakers are available. All that is needed, as Dr. Wickwire demonstrated.<br />\nis a little initiative. It is not too late to arrange programs<br />\nfor this year and certainly for next year.

She knew verbatim the complete works<br />\nof Franz Kafka,she sang solos in stereo, she wore a black<br />\nleather jacket with an original Goya on the back.<br />\nWell sir, Crunch took one look and his jaw dropped and<br />\nhis nostrils pulsed like a bellows and his kneecaps turned<br />\nto sorghum. Never had he beheld such sophistication,such<br />\nintellect, such savoir faire. Not, mind you, that Crunch<br />\nwas a dolt. He was, to be sure, a country boy, but he had a<br />\nhead oh his shoulders, believe you me! Take, for instance,<br />\nhis choice of razor blades.

Crunch, as we have seen, was instantly<br />\nsmitten with Irmgard Champerty. All day he followed her<br />\naround campus and listened to her talk abou,t Franz Kafka<br />\nand like that, and then be went back to his dormitory and<br />\nfound this letter from his home town sweetheart Mildred:<br />\nDear Crunch:<br />\nUs kids had a keen time yesterday.

Suddenly he knew he had outgrown young, innocent<br />\nMildred; his heart now belonged to smart, sophisticated<br />\nIrmgard.<br />\nBeing above all things honorable, he returned forthwith to Cut and Shoot, Pa., and looked Mildred straight in<br />\nthe eye and said manlily, \"I do not love you any more. I<br />\nlove another. You can hit me in the stomach all your might<br />\n<br />\nif you want to:'<br />\n<br />\n\"That's okay, hey',' said Mildred amiably. \"I don't love<br />\nyou neither. I found a new boy:'<br />\n\"What is his name?\" asked Crunch.<br />\n\"Franz Kafka,\" said Mildred.<br />\n\"I hope you will be very happy:' said Crunch and shook<br />\nMildred's hand and they have remained good friends to<br />\nthis day. In fact, Crunch and Irmgard often double-date<br />\nwith Franz and Mildred and have barrels of fun.

That the System has made a<br />\nVast number of positive contributions<br />\nCan hardly be denied. The high degree<br />\nof trust between the students and the<br />\nfaculty, the atmosphere of academic<br />\nfreedom, and the maturity and responsibility of the Hopkins student all have<br />\ntheir roots in the principles of the<br />\nHonor System.<br />\nIn 1948, an Honor Commission was<br />\nCreated to perpetuate the traditions of<br />\nthe Honor System. Previously, the responsibilities for .the maintenance of<br />\nthe System rested with the faculty and<br />\nthe Student Council. The Commission<br /><br />\n***<br /><br />\nexistence. And unfortunately, many<br />\ncommission members in the past have<br />\ne<br />\nlost sight of this.<br />\nIt is, therefore, imperative that the<br />\nCommission take immediate steps to<br />\neducate the student body in the problems of the system and elicit suggestions from them. The key to increasing<br />\nstudent interest in the workings of the<br />\nCommission and the System lies in<br />\ngreater contact between the Commission members and the students.<br />\nAt the present time, the Commission<br />\nIs lacking in heterogeneity. For instance, only one member of the Commission lives in a dormitory while all<br />\nbut one were or are members of fraternities. This uneven distibution tends<br />\nto narrow discussion concerning the<br />\nCommission and the System to only a<br />\npart of the Hopkins community. The<br />\nultimate solution would be for the<br />\nCommission to consciously attempt to<br />\ngain a broad cross-section of new members when consideration of new candidates occurs at the end of the year.<br /><br />\nPossible Media<br />\nBut there is a much better way for<br />\nthe Commission to reach a greater part<br />\nof the community. The institution of a<br />\nseries of forums where a few commission members would answer questions<br />\nand discuss important problems that<br />\nplague the Commission would be quite<br />\neffective in inducing student interest<br />\nand discussion of the vital matters of<br />\nany particular year. In addition, certain members of the community could<br />\nbe chosen after the forums to present<br />\ntheir views at Commission meetings.<br />\nThe value of student forums at HopDAVID BUCHDAHL<br />\nkins was evident last December when<br />\napproximately fifty students came on<br />\nnot<br />\nbut<br />\nyears<br />\nhas survived for twenty<br />\na snowy afternoon before Christmas vaWithout a fair share of controversy.<br />\ncation to participate in a forum on<br />\nMuch of the criticism of the Comchanges in the curriculum.<br />\nmission has centered upon personalities<br />\nCommunication could also be greatly<br />\nand has therefore been senseless and<br />\nenhanced by the use of the Newsletter.<br />\nharmful to the System.

Hopkins students and<br />\nothers all over the country are no<br />\nlonger satisfied with just seeing films,<br />\nthey want to start making them. In<br />\ndoing so they are making new demands<br />\non the university.<br />\nMaking films is becoming one of the<br />\nmost popular, but one of the most expensive forms of expression on the<br />\ncampus. Although no one seems to<br />\nknow exactly how many films are being<br />\nmade, a New York University professor<br />\nestimates that students are cranking<br />\nout :several hundred finished films every<br />\nsemester. In terms of enrollment graduate programs in film have jumped<br />\ntremendously. N.Y.U. for example went<br />\nfrom 3 in 1960 to 110 this year, while<br />\nschools in California are turning away<br />\nalmost as many applicants as they<br />\naccept.<br />\nBut the gains aren't in quality alone.<br />\nArthur Knight, film critic of the Saturday Review and one of the judges<br />\nfor the festival says, \"Fully a third of<br />\nthe films we saw gave us a very real<br />\nsense of discovery.\" He adds that many<br />\nof the films were of near professional<br />\ntechnical quality.<br />\nUniversities Respond<br />\nUniversities, both in the east and in<br />\nthe west have been responding to this<br />\nsurge of interest in film. Yale gave one<br />\nof its students $1,500 to make a film<br />\nfor his seniors honor program. The<br />\nresult was a 42 minute film called<br />\n\"Talking of Michelangelo\" which one of<br />\nthe professors at Yale called a work<br />\nof \"exceptional distinction.\"<br />\nColumbia, the Veteran of the Ivy<br />\nLeague in film, is planning to expand<br />\ntheir program in the next few years.<br />\nHaying already spent millions of dollars to develop their program to the<br />\npoint that it has reached now, they<br />\nhave found that they will have to invest even more money, energy and<br />\nimagination to meet the growing needs.<br />\nDartmouth has a small film program<br />\nwhich they plan to enlarge. Liberal<br />\nArts students at Princeton can apply<br />\nfor free film for approved projects.<br />\nProfessors at Oberlin helped students<br />\nform a club to raise money for moviemaking.

Where film production<br />\nisn't part of the curriculum, moviemakers have the added costs of rents<br />\ning cameras and lenses.<br />\nMajor Successes<br />\nBut despite quiet beginnings; some<br />\nstudents have achieved major successes.<br />\nTwo years ago, two Has-yard University<br />\ngraduates filmed \"Nothing But a Man\",<br />\na dramatic profile of a negro railroad<br />\nlaborer.

The great danger<br />\ninherent in such public sentiment is that it breeds frustration and frustration in turn breeds the most dangerous kind of irrationality.<br />\nSuch a national psychosis made it possible for<br />\nSenator McCarthy to use the frustrations of America's<br />\nlimited world battle with the Communists and turn them<br />\nagainst a mythical threat at home. One of the first places<br />\nhe turned to find a domestic conspiracy were the colleges and universities.<br />\nWe are all aware that our University reacted to that<br />\nthreat with courage and plain good sense.

A student's ratio<br />\nof films to novels may be 20 to 1;<br />\nbut although the college he attends is likely to offer more titan<br />\na dozen literature courses, it is<br />\njust as likely that he will not<br />\nyet find a single course in motion picture history or criticism<br />\nor the opportunities for directed<br />\nwork in production which can<br />\nbring him to a closer understanding of the demand and<br />\nresources of the medium. This<br />\ncircumstance s e e in s strange,<br />\nespecially when one considers<br />\nthat the number of motion pictures made in the United States<br />\nlast year was greater than the<br />\nnumber of books entered into<br />\ncopyright!

A young man goes off to college,<br />\nleaving his home town sweetheart with vows of eternal<br />\nlove, and then he finds that he has outgrown her. What,in<br />\nsuch cases, is the honorable thing to do?<br />\nWell sir, you can do what Crunch Sigafoos did.<br /><br />\nWhen Crunch left his home in Cut and Shoot, Pa., to go<br />\noff to a prominent midwestern university (Florida State)<br />\nhe said to his sweetheart, a wholesome country lass named<br />\nMildred Bovine,\"My dear, though I am far away in college, I will love you always. I take a mighty oath I will<br />\nnever look at another girl. If I do, may my eyeballs parch<br />\nand wither, may my viscera writhe like adders, may my<br />\never-press slacks go baggy!\"<br />\nThen he clutched Mildred to his bosom, flicked some<br />\nhayseed from her hair, planted a final kiss upon her fragrant young skull, and went away, meaning with all his<br />\nheart to be faithful.<br />\nBut on the very first day of college he met a coed named<br />\nIrmgard Champerty who was studded with culture like a<br />\nham with cloves. She knew verbatim the complete works<br />\nof Franz Kafka,she sang solos in stereo, she wore a black<br />\nleather jacket with an original Goya on the back.<br />\nWell sir, Crunch took one look and his jaw dropped and<br />\nhis nostrils pulsed like a bellows and his kneecaps turned<br />\nto sorghum. Never had he beheld such sophistication,such<br />\nintellect, such savoir faire. Not, mind you, that Crunch<br />\nwas a dolt. He was, to be sure, a country boy, but he had a<br />\nhead oh his shoulders, believe you me! Take, for instance,<br />\nhis choice of razor blades. Crunch always shaved with<br />\nPersonna Super Stainless Steel Blades, and if that doesn't<br />\nshow good sense, I am Rex the Wonder Horse. No other<br />\nblade shaves you so comfortably so often. No other blade<br />\nbrings you such facial felicity, such epidermal elan.<br />\nPersonna Super Stainless Steel Blades take the travail out<br />\nof shaving,scrap the scrape, negate the nick, peel the pull,<br />\noust the ouch. Furthermore, Personnas are available both<br />\nin double-edge style and in injector style. If you're smart<br />\n\u2014and I'm sure you are, or how'd you get out of high school<br />\n\u2014you'll get a pack of Personnas before another sun has set.<br />\nBut I digress. Crunch, as we have seen, was instantly<br />\nsmitten with Irmgard Champerty. All day he followed her<br />\naround campus and listened to her talk abou,t Franz Kafka<br />\nand like that, and then be went back to his dormitory and<br />\nfound this letter from his home town sweetheart Mildred:<br />\nDear Crunch:<br />\nUs kids had a keen time yesterday. We went down to<br />\nthe pond and caught some frogs. I caught the most of<br />\nanybody. Then we hitched rides on trucks and did lots<br />\nof nutsy stuff like that. Well,I must close now because I<br />\ngot to whitewash the fence.<br />\nYour friend,<br />\nMildred<br />\nPS....I know how to ride backwards on my skateboard.<br />\nWell sir, Crunch thought about Mildred and then he<br />\nthought about Irmgard and then a great sadness fell upon<br />\nhim. Suddenly he knew he had outgrown young, innocent<br />\nMildred; his heart now belonged to smart, sophisticated<br />\nIrmgard.<br />\nBeing above all things honorable, he returned forthwith to Cut and Shoot, Pa., and looked Mildred straight in<br />\nthe eye and said manlily, \"I do not love you any more. I<br />\nlove another. You can hit me in the stomach all your might<br /><br />\nif you want to:'<br /><br />\n\"That's okay, hey',' said Mildred amiably. \"I don't love<br />\nyou neither. I found a new boy:'<br />\n\"What is his name?\" asked Crunch.<br />\n\"Franz Kafka,\" said Mildred.<br />\n\"I hope you will be very happy:' said Crunch and shook<br />\nMildred's hand and they have remained good friends to<br />\nthis day. In fact, Crunch and Irmgard often double-date<br />\nwith Franz and Mildred and have barrels of fun.
