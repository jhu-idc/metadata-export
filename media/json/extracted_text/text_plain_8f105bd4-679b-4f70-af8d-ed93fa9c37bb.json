In questions com\u2022ing before .the council relative to the<br />\nhonor system and such which are<br />\nclearly defined as being right\u2014or<br />\nbeing wrong, then members of the<br />\ncouncil should immediately take a<br />\nstand on these questions and have the<br />\ncourage to stick to their convictions.<br />\nHowever in those questions which<br />\nhave no defined right or wrong, but<br />\nare determined so by concensus of<br />\nopinion in majority rule, the members of the council should endeavor<br />\nto sit on the fence and hear all sides<br />\nto this 'type of question with every<br />\nangle presented. Then remembering<br />\nthat his duty is to, represent the<br />\nmembers of his class who elected him<br />\nto office, rather than any organization on the campus, any single faction, or administrative authority, the<br />\ncouncilman should take a stand<br />\nwhich in a representative one\u2014not<br />\nonly of himself as an individual but<br />\nothers around him.

In questions com\u2022ing before .the council relative to the<br />\nhonor system and such which are<br />\nclearly defined as being right\u2014or<br />\nbeing wrong, then members of the<br />\ncouncil should immediately take a<br />\nstand on these questions and have the<br />\ncourage to stick to their convictions.<br />\nHowever in those questions which<br />\nhave no defined right or wrong, but<br />\nare determined so by concensus of<br />\nopinion in majority rule, the members of the council should endeavor<br />\nto sit on the fence and hear all sides<br />\nto this 'type of question with every<br />\nangle presented. Then remembering<br />\nthat his duty is to, represent the<br />\nmembers of his class who elected him<br />\nto office, rather than any organization on the campus, any single faction, or administrative authority, the<br />\ncouncilman should take a stand<br />\nwhich in a representative one\u2014not<br />\nonly of himself as an individual but<br />\nothers around him.
