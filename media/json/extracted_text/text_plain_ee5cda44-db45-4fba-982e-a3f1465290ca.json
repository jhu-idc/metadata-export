SITE commemorates the Civil<br />\nWar battle of Antietam, sometimes called Sharpsburg. It is of outstand-<br />\ning importance in American history, since it marked the ending of General<br />\nRobert E. Lee\u2019s first invasion of the North, thereby postponing indefi-<br />\nnitely England\u2019s threatened recognition of the Confederacy and giving<br />\nPresident Lincoln the opportunity to issue his Emancipation Proclama-<br />\ntion. The neighboring Antietam National Cemetery is also under the<br />\nadministration of the National Park Service, since it is part of the historic<br />\nground over which the battle was fought. It is the burial place of Federal<br />\ndead from the battles of Antietam, South Mountain, and minor engage-<br />\nments of the region. A library and small museum, located in the adminis-<br />\ntration building at the entrance to the National Cemetery, are available<br />\nfor the use of visitors.

This old waterway, one of the least altered<br />\nof the older American canals, is an example of the ever-improving means<br />\nof transportation that helped to bind the Nation together. Through the<br />\nnatural passageway to the West afforded by the Potomac River Valley<br />\nhave passed the Indian trail, colonial wagon road, canal, railroad, tele-<br />\ngraph and telephone, and the modern superhighway. By these constantly<br />\nimproving modes of communication the once widely separated eastern<br />\nand western regions of the fast-growing Union were firmly linked both<br />\nsocially and commercially. Twenty-two miles of the old canal, between<br />\nGeorgetown, D. C., and Seneca, Maryland, have been restored by the<br />\nNational Park Service. Specially conducted tours via an old-time mule-<br />\ndrawn barge are available on the canal during the summer months.<br />\nCanoeing, boating, hiking, fishing, picnicking, nature walks, and ice<br />\nskating are among the recreational opportunities. Canoes and rowboats<br />\nmay be rented at Great Falls; and privately owned canoes are permitted<br />\non the canal.

It is the burial place of Federal<br />\ndead from the battles of Antietam, South Mountain, and minor engage-<br />\nments of the region.

This old waterway, one of the least altered<br />\nof the older American canals, is an example of the ever-improving means<br />\nof transportation that helped to bind the Nation together. Through the<br />\nnatural passageway to the West afforded by the Potomac River Valley<br />\nhave passed the Indian trail, colonial wagon road, canal, railroad, tele-<br />\ngraph and telephone, and the modern superhighway. By these constantly<br />\nimproving modes of communication the once widely separated eastern<br />\nand western regions of the fast-growing Union were firmly linked both<br />\nsocially and commercially. Twenty-two miles of the old canal, between<br />\nGeorgetown, D. C., and Seneca, Maryland, have been restored by the<br />\nNational Park Service. Specially conducted tours via an old-time mule-<br />\ndrawn barge are available on the canal during the summer months.<br />\nCanoeing, boating, hiking, fishing, picnicking, nature walks, and ice<br />\nskating are among the recreational opportunities.
