It is this latter argument that we wish to<br />\ndiscuss.<br />\n<br />\nWe have been told that most of the students entering under the<br />\nGoodnow Plan have either dropped out a short while after matriculation or have spent their time aimlessly wandering from department to<br />\ndepartment without doing any real work or progressing toward a degree. We felt that this change was so serious and, if it were true, so<br />\ndamaging to the prestige of the Graduate School that we determined<br />\nto have a complete analysis made. The NEWS-LETTER is in possession<br />\nof figures from fourteen departments of the University that tell the<br />\n:whole story. The figures follow:<br />\nNumber of New Plan students entered first half 1929-30, 27; number of New Plan students entered second half, 27; number of degrees<br />\nawarded, 9; number of students dropped, none.<br />\nUnfortunately, we were not able to gather statistics for previous<br />\nyears, but the above figures amply prove that the New Plan, this year,<br />\nis in a healthy and flourishing state. No matter if the figures for the<br />\n-past years should show less attractive results, we could neglect them,<br />\nfor the condition that exists today and the prospects for the future are<br />\nthe only important matters to consider.<br />\n<br />\nROWLAND HALL<br />\n<br />\nnUR predecessor in office urged that the new Physics Building be<br />\nnamed in honor of the great Hopkins scientist, Dr. Rowland.<br />\n\u2022 While his suggestion has not been discarded, nothing has as yet been<br />\ndone toward endowing the latest addition to the Homewood group<br />\nwith a name.<br />\nCalling the new building Rowland Hall would serve a double purpose. It would honor Dr. Rowland, perpetuating his great name. It<br />\nwould also help toward creating an \"identity\" for the building, transforming what is now merely a mass of brick and mortar to something<br />\nthat has a vital, unique existence of its own.\u2022<br />\nIf the University officials intend to call the new building Rowland<br />\nHall it should be done as quickly as possible, for a habit once formed<br />\nis difficult to break and, unless something is done quickly, we shall<br />\ngo on speaking of the structure as the \"Physics Building\" long after<br />\nit has been officially named. An example is Remsen Hall. Excluding<br />\nthe younger members of the college most of us still call it the \"Chem<br />\nLab\" after three years. There is an extraordinarily easy way of keeping<br />\nthe same duplicity of names from arising in the case of the new structure. It is to start calling the building Rowland Hall now without<br />\nwaiting for it to be officially named.\u2022 Then if it is named after the<br />\ngreat scientist we shall have avoided getting into the habit of speakins of it by another name. If it is not named \"Rowland Hall\" nothing<br />\nwill have been lost by using that appelation now since we will then<br />\nbe compelled only to forget one name instead of another.<br />\n<br />\nR.H.HANNEY<br />\nTuft's,'26<br />\nCondenser Sales<br />\n<br />\nTT is engineering that breathes the<br />\nspark of life into lifeless metal,<br />\nthat converts it into active machinery, that makes of it an adaptable<br />\nservant.

BOYLE<br />\nPratt Institute,'27<br />\nTurbine Sales<br /><br />\nWHAT IS THE NEW PLAN DOING?<br />\nnew Plan has been damned<br /><br />\nthe beginning of the year, the<br />\nSINCE<br />\nby two classes of university members; those who are afraid the<br />\nextracurricular activities,<br /><br />\nPlan will cause a growing diminution of<br />\nboth athletic and non-athletic, and those who claimed that the Plan<br />\n\u2022 has proved a failure per se. It is this latter argument that we wish to<br />\ndiscuss.<br /><br />\nWe have been told that most of the students entering under the<br />\nGoodnow Plan have either dropped out a short while after matriculation or have spent their time aimlessly wandering from department to<br />\ndepartment without doing any real work or progressing toward a degree. We felt that this change was so serious and, if it were true, so<br />\ndamaging to the prestige of the Graduate School that we determined<br />\nto have a complete analysis made. The NEWS-LETTER is in possession<br />\nof figures from fourteen departments of the University that tell the<br />\n:whole story. The figures follow:<br />\nNumber of New Plan students entered first half 1929-30, 27; number of New Plan students entered second half, 27; number of degrees<br />\nawarded, 9; number of students dropped, none.<br />\nUnfortunately, we were not able to gather statistics for previous<br />\nyears, but the above figures amply prove that the New Plan, this year,<br />\nis in a healthy and flourishing state. No matter if the figures for the<br />\n-past years should show less attractive results, we could neglect them,<br />\nfor the condition that exists today and the prospects for the future are<br />\nthe only important matters to consider.<br /><br />\nROWLAND HALL<br /><br />\nnUR predecessor in office urged that the new Physics Building be<br />\nnamed in honor of the great Hopkins scientist, Dr. Rowland.<br />\n\u2022 While his suggestion has not been discarded, nothing has as yet been<br />\ndone toward endowing the latest addition to the Homewood group<br />\nwith a name.<br />\nCalling the new building Rowland Hall would serve a double purpose. It would honor Dr. Rowland, perpetuating his great name. It<br />\nwould also help toward creating an \"identity\" for the building, transforming what is now merely a mass of brick and mortar to something<br />\nthat has a vital, unique existence of its own.\u2022<br />\nIf the University officials intend to call the new building Rowland<br />\nHall it should be done as quickly as possible, for a habit once formed<br />\nis difficult to break and, unless something is done quickly, we shall<br />\ngo on speaking of the structure as the \"Physics Building\" long after<br />\nit has been officially named. An example is Remsen Hall. Excluding<br />\nthe younger members of the college most of us still call it the \"Chem<br />\nLab\" after three years. There is an extraordinarily easy way of keeping<br />\nthe same duplicity of names from arising in the case of the new structure. It is to start calling the building Rowland Hall now without<br />\nwaiting for it to be officially named.\u2022 Then if it is named after the<br />\ngreat scientist we shall have avoided getting into the habit of speakins of it by another name. If it is not named \"Rowland Hall\" nothing<br />\nwill have been lost by using that appelation now since we will then<br />\nbe compelled only to forget one name instead of another.<br /><br />\nR.H.HANNEY<br />\nTuft's,'26<br />\nCondenser Sales<br /><br />\nTT is engineering that breathes the<br />\nspark of life into lifeless metal,<br />\nthat converts it into active machinery, that makes of it an adaptable<br />\nservant.
