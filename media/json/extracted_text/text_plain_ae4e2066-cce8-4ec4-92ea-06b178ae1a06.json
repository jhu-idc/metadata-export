Granted,<br />\nthere exists a certain amount of<br />\nunwarrantable hostility, resentment, petty jealousy, etc., a<br />\nvisible rivalry, shall we say, between Goucher and Hopkins<br />\nwomen. Is it any wonder,<br />\nespecially when such rude and<br />\nabusive comments abound (in<br />\nprint, no less!). I pity the<br />\nwomen who have so little selfrespect that they feel compelled<br />\nto downgrade other women, in<br />\nan attempt to boost their own<br />\nself-image. Come, come now,<br />\n,<br />\n<br />\ncoupled with the accusation<br />\nthat Hopkins men who seek<br />\nfriendship or romance with<br />\nGoucher women are breaking<br />\n\"the course of evolution\" by<br />\nmixing with inferior blood not<br />\nonly points to a bizarre Nazitype of separationist sentiment<br />\nbut to stupidity.<br />\nGranted, Goucher women<br />\nshow up at Hopkins for social<br />\nlife. Hopkins men take the<br />\nshuttle over to Goucher, too.<br />\nIt's a relationship which has<br />\ngone on for almost 100 years<br />\nand not even almighty coeducation will stop it. Still, it is a<br />\nminority of Hopkins men who<br />\nwill deign to profer their affections on Goucher students, and<br />\nit is ,a minority of Goucher<br />\nstudents that go crazy over<br />\nHopkins men. You really have<br />\nthem academically, socially,<br />\nand sexually 24 hours a day, so<br />\nwhy do you have to act like<br />\njealous children?<br />\nSo, I'd like to reassure the<br />\nnaive author-ettes of the piece<br />\nof journalistic tripe that no, we<br />\ndon't have all your goodlooking men.

In<br />\nseveral instances<br />\nJesus<br />\nspecifically ministered to<br />\n<br />\nwomen and let them know that<br />\nthey were as important as men<br />\nin His sight. Christ's discussion<br />\nwith the woman of Samaria; his<br />\ncuring of the \"woman who had<br />\nan issue of blood for twelve<br />\nyears\"(Mark 5:25-34), and his<br />\nmercy to Mary Magdelene are<br />\nfew of a very long list.<br />\nBason's statement that \"God<br />\nwas so turned off by women<br />\nthat He could not bear to impregnate one of them, and thus<br />\nhad His Son by a virgin\"\u2014<br />\nwhether sarcastic or serious\u2014<br />\nis simply wrong! Matthew 1:20<br />\nmakes it clear that the \"seed in<br />\nMary was conceived\u2014not of a<br />\nnatural man\u2014but of the Holy<br />\nGhost\"\u2014representative of God<br />\nHimself. The fact that Jesus'<br />\nbirth was by a virgin is further<br />\nindication of the divine aspect<br />\nof His being.<br />\nSimilarly, Wayne Johnson<br />\nsupported his views about<br />\nfeminism on the basis of scripture. Johnson asserts that Jude<br />\n16 proves the evil in women. If<br />\nJohnson had taken the passage<br />\nin its proper context, he would<br />\nhave discovered that it referred<br />\nto ungodly souls\u2014whether they<br />\nbe male or female.<br />\nAs a born-again believer, I<br />\nsuggest that before one attempts to speak on anything<br />\npertaining to God's Word, he<br />\nmust know the Lord personally.<br />\nWithout such a bond with God,<br />\none is unable to and unjustified<br />\nin interpreting His Word.

Originally a drama<br />\ncritic himself, Shaw often<br />\ncriticized those who criticized<br />\nhis works. \"The pitiful efforts<br />\nthe dramatic critics make to say<br />\nkind things about any play I<br />\nwrite are very amusing,\" he<br />\nwrote in 1900, \"they do not in<br />\nthe least understand what I am<br />\ndriving at...\"<br />\nBearing this in mind, I shall<br />\nnow proceed to say several kind<br />\nthings about Shaw's You Never<br />\nCan Tell as presented at the<br />\nCenter Stage Theater. One of<br />\nShaw's earliest dramatic works,<br />\nYou Never Can Tell is set in an<br />\nEnglish seaside resort at the<br />\nclose of the 19th century. The<br />\nstory, to give only the briefest<br />\ndescription, concerns a dentist,<br />\nMr. Valentine, and his encounter with Mrs. Clandon and<br />\nher three children. Mrs. Clandon, the author of series of<br />\ntreatises on 20th century living,<br />\nis the paradigm of the Victorian<br />\nWomen's Rights movement.<br />\nShe has brought her children up<br />\nfatherless (by choice) and has<br />\nsubjected them to growing up<br />\nin Portugal according to her<br />\nscientific methods.

For the<br />\nlast 10 years, they've been on<br />\nthe NCAA's endangered<br />\nspecies list, almost extinct in<br />\nupper stratosphere, with only a<br />\nfew bald eagles like the Irish,<br />\nMarquette, and De Paul hanging on to their nests in the lofty crags.<br />\nNow, it looks like they'll go<br />\nthe way of the buffalo,<br />\nsomething they have been forced to do just to assure<br />\nthemselves a schedule.

Leslie Matthews. M.D.<br />\n<br />\nUnion Memorial Hospital<br />\nSports Medicine Center<br />\nArthroscopy is a medical<br />\nterm which means \"looking into a joint.\"<br />\nThe term refers to a relatively new procedure which allows<br />\na physician to visually inspect<br />\nthe internal aspect of a joint by<br />\nutilizing a small fiberoptic<br />\ntelescope (\"arthroscope\"). This<br />\ninstrument is introduced into<br />\nthe joint through a small punc1<br />\n4 inch<br />\nture site approximately /<br />\nin length. By maneuvering the<br />\narthroscope within the joint,<br />\nthe entire interior aspect of the<br />\njoint can be directly inspected<br />\nfor abnormalities.<br />\nHistorically, the technique of<br />\narthroscopy was originated in<br />\nJapan in the early 1960's. The<br />\ntechnique was quickly adopted<br />\nby several surgeons in the<br />\nUnited States but it was not until several technological advancements were made that the<br />\nprocedure became more widely utilized. With the development of fiberoptics, better lens<br />\nsystems, and better instrument<br />\ndesign, clear and relatively easy<br />\nvisualization of the internal<br />\naspects of the joints then<br />\nbecame possible.<br />\n' As the knee joint is the<br />\nlargest joint in the body and is<br />\nrelatively prone to injury, arthroscopy was first utilized extensively in the diagnosis of<br />\nknee disorders. Knee disorders<br />\n<br />\nremain the most common joint<br />\nabnormality for which arthroscopic techniques are<br />\nemployed.<br />\nThe arthroscope has now proven itself to be invaluable in the<br />\ndiagnosis of a variety of knee<br />\nconditions including meniscal<br />\ntears (\"torn cartilage\"), loose<br />\nbodies, ligament injuries, and<br />\narthritis. Because arthroscopy<br />\nallows for direct visualization<br />\nof the joint, in experienced<br />\nhands it has reduced the need<br />\nfor indirect tests such as arthrograms (dye injections into<br />\nthe joint with x-rays).<br />\nArt hroscopic surgery is a<br />\ntechnique by which surgery can<br />\nbe performed using the arthroscope. In this technique,<br />\nsmall instruments are introduced inside the joint through<br />\nother punctures and surgery is<br />\nperformed under the direct<br />\nvisualization afforded by the<br />\narthroscope. Utilizing this<br />\ntechnique, such procedures as<br />\nremoval of a torn menisci,<br />\nloose bodies, and bone spurs<br />\ncan be accomplished, thus<br />\neliminating the need for conventional open sugery.<br />\nThe procedure itself can<br />\nusually be performed on an<br />\noutpatient basis. Arthroscopy is<br />\nperformed in an operating<br />\nroom under sterile conditions.<br />\nWhile art hroscopy of the knee<br />\ncan be performed under local<br />\n(Novocaine) anesthesia, it is<br />\nusually done under general<br />\nanesthesia. The arthroscope<br />\n(and other instruments if need-<br />\n<br />\ned)are introduced into the knee<br />\nthrough small puncture sites,<br />\neach requiring only one stitch to<br />\nclose following the procedure.<br />\nWith current technology, a<br />\nsmall TV camera can be attached to the scope to allow for<br />\nvisualization of the procedure<br />\non a TV monitor. Video tapes<br />\nof the procedure can thereby be<br />\nmade for permanent records.<br />\nFollowing arthroscopic<br />\nsurgery, most patients are able<br />\nto walk immediately, requiring<br />\nthe use of a cane or crutches for<br />\na few days only. Most patients<br />\nare able to return to athletic activity within four to six weeks<br />\nfollowing this procedure,<br />\ndepending on the type of problem encountered and the type<br />\nof procedure performed.<br />\nSince the techniques for arthroscopy and arthroscopic<br />\nsurgery of the knee have proven<br />\nthemselves to be significant advances in medical technology,<br />\ninvestigation is ongoing to<br />\nassess the role of these techniques in other joint disorders.<br />\nThe use of arthroscopy to<br />\ndiagnose and treat certain<br />\nshoulder disorders has already<br />\nproven itself to be effective.<br />\nArthroscopy has been successfully performed on other<br />\njoints as well, such as the ankle,<br />\nelbow, and wrist. However, the<br />\nrelatively small size and tight<br />\nconfiguration of these joints<br />\nmakes the procedure more difficult and often less rewarding.<br />\nAs further experience is gained<br />\nand tecimology evolves, these<br />\n<br />\npresent limitations may be<br />\novercome.<br />\nFinally, it must be pointed<br />\nout that arthroscopy and arthroscopic surgery are not applicable to every knee disorder.<br />\nSome knee injuries and diseases<br />\nrequire no surgery while others<br />\nstill require the routine<br />\noperative procedures for treatment. When appropriate,<br />\nhowever, art hroscopy and arthroscopic surgery offer the advantages of fewer risks to the<br />\npatient and reduced recovery<br />\ntime which can be especially important for athletes.<br />\n<br />\nNo Playoffs For Jaysl<br />\nby Bruce Solitar<br />\nThirty-one<br />\npoints<br />\nby<br />\nWidener forward Leon Jones<br />\nled the Pioneers to a 67-64 victory over the Jays last Saturday<br />\nnight at the athletic center.

Granted,<br />\nthere exists a certain amount of<br />\nunwarrantable hostility, resentment, petty jealousy, etc., a<br />\nvisible rivalry, shall we say, between Goucher and Hopkins<br />\nwomen. Is it any wonder,<br />\nespecially when such rude and<br />\nabusive comments abound (in<br />\nprint, no less!). I pity the<br />\nwomen who have so little selfrespect that they feel compelled<br />\nto downgrade other women, in<br />\nan attempt to boost their own<br />\nself-image. Come, come now,<br />\n,<br /><br />\ncoupled with the accusation<br />\nthat Hopkins men who seek<br />\nfriendship or romance with<br />\nGoucher women are breaking<br />\n\"the course of evolution\" by<br />\nmixing with inferior blood not<br />\nonly points to a bizarre Nazitype of separationist sentiment<br />\nbut to stupidity.<br />\nGranted, Goucher women<br />\nshow up at Hopkins for social<br />\nlife. Hopkins men take the<br />\nshuttle over to Goucher, too.<br />\nIt's a relationship which has<br />\ngone on for almost 100 years<br />\nand not even almighty coeducation will stop it. Still, it is a<br />\nminority of Hopkins men who<br />\nwill deign to profer their affections on Goucher students, and<br />\nit is ,a minority of Goucher<br />\nstudents that go crazy over<br />\nHopkins men. You really have<br />\nthem academically, socially,<br />\nand sexually 24 hours a day, so<br />\nwhy do you have to act like<br />\njealous children?<br />\nSo, I'd like to reassure the<br />\nnaive author-ettes of the piece<br />\nof journalistic tripe that no, we<br />\ndon't have all your goodlooking men. Its' a wonder,<br />\nthough, because after really<br />\nexamining the warped nature of<br />\nyour sexual frustration,<br />\nHopkins men should be coming<br />\nover by the shuttleload to<br />\nbecomefriends with the women<br />\nyou lambasted so severely.

Any bornagain child of God and student<br />\nof His Word believes that Jesus<br />\nChrist\u2014the express image of<br />\nGod manifested in the flesh\u2014<br />\nclarified misconceptions of<br />\nGod's view of women. In<br />\nseveral instances<br />\nJesus<br />\nspecifically ministered to<br /><br />\nwomen and let them know that<br />\nthey were as important as men<br />\nin His sight. Christ's discussion<br />\nwith the woman of Samaria; his<br />\ncuring of the \"woman who had<br />\nan issue of blood for twelve<br />\nyears\"(Mark 5:25-34), and his<br />\nmercy to Mary Magdelene are<br />\nfew of a very long list.<br />\nBason's statement that \"God<br />\nwas so turned off by women<br />\nthat He could not bear to impregnate one of them, and thus<br />\nhad His Son by a virgin\"\u2014<br />\nwhether sarcastic or serious\u2014<br />\nis simply wrong! Matthew 1:20<br />\nmakes it clear that the \"seed in<br />\nMary was conceived\u2014not of a<br />\nnatural man\u2014but of the Holy<br />\nGhost\"\u2014representative of God<br />\nHimself. The fact that Jesus'<br />\nbirth was by a virgin is further<br />\nindication of the divine aspect<br />\nof His being.<br />\nSimilarly, Wayne Johnson<br />\nsupported his views about<br />\nfeminism on the basis of scripture. Johnson asserts that Jude<br />\n16 proves the evil in women. If<br />\nJohnson had taken the passage<br />\nin its proper context, he would<br />\nhave discovered that it referred<br />\nto ungodly souls\u2014whether they<br />\nbe male or female.<br />\nAs a born-again believer, I<br />\nsuggest that before one attempts to speak on anything<br />\npertaining to God's Word, he<br />\nmust know the Lord personally.<br />\nWithout such a bond with God,<br />\none is unable to and unjustified<br />\nin interpreting His Word.

Originally a drama<br />\ncritic himself, Shaw often<br />\ncriticized those who criticized<br />\nhis works. \"The pitiful efforts<br />\nthe dramatic critics make to say<br />\nkind things about any play I<br />\nwrite are very amusing,\" he<br />\nwrote in 1900, \"they do not in<br />\nthe least understand what I am<br />\ndriving at...\"<br />\nBearing this in mind, I shall<br />\nnow proceed to say several kind<br />\nthings about Shaw's You Never<br />\nCan Tell as presented at the<br />\nCenter Stage Theater. One of<br />\nShaw's earliest dramatic works,<br />\nYou Never Can Tell is set in an<br />\nEnglish seaside resort at the<br />\nclose of the 19th century. The<br />\nstory, to give only the briefest<br />\ndescription, concerns a dentist,<br />\nMr. Valentine, and his encounter with Mrs. Clandon and<br />\nher three children. Mrs. Clandon, the author of series of<br />\ntreatises on 20th century living,<br />\nis the paradigm of the Victorian<br />\nWomen's Rights movement.<br />\nShe has brought her children up<br />\nfatherless (by choice) and has<br />\nsubjected them to growing up<br />\nin Portugal according to her<br />\nscientific methods.

To assure their<br />\nschedule, they've entered into<br />\nthis agreement, but my bet is<br />\nthat it will end up as just<br />\nanother conference down the<br />\nroad, with the winner getting<br />\nthat automatic invitation to the<br />\nNCAA's big party\u2014Miller<br />\nTime in March.<br />\nIt's sad to see the end of major independents. They were<br />\nalways charming, exciting Alice<br />\nIn Wonderland-type teams who<br />\ncould travel from coast to<br />\ncoast, border to border. They<br />\nwere refreshing, kind of off the<br />\nnormal beaten path, and their<br />\nschedule wasn't mundane, a<br />\n50-year scheduling thing of the<br />\nsame teams every year. You<br />\ncould bring in a Jacksonville,<br />\nthe Air Force Academy, St.<br />\nJohns.<br />\nWhat I liked best about being an independent was that<br />\nwhen Cinderella made the ball,<br />\nala Notre Dame or Marquette,<br />\nand went to final four, they got<br />\nto keep all the money, where<br />\nMichigan would have to go to<br />\nnine straight parties to niake<br />\nwhat the independents made.<br />\nIf the independents go, it will<br />\nput an end to the ageless argument about who has the most<br />\ndifficult schedule, the conference school or the<br />\nindependent.<br />\nI've always said, all coaches<br />\nschedule a certain amount of<br />\ncupcakes, no matter who they<br />\nare. It's just that with conference schools, their cupcakes<br />\nare in their conference and they<br />\nget to play 'them twice.<br />\nThe argument against independents is that they have a<br />\nsoft schedule, that they can kinda stroke it. Hey, I admit 1<br />\nbook my six or seven cupcakes<br />\nevery season. But the thing is,<br />\nthe conference teams would<br />\nhave their cupcakes in preconference, and then once they '<br />\nstarted conference play. they<br />\nhad four more cupcakes, too,<br />\nbecause they played everybody<br />\ntwice.<br />\nAnother advantage most<br />\nconference teams have is that<br />\nthey have three ways to gel to<br />\nthe NCAA tournament.

Leslie Matthews. M.D.<br /><br />\nUnion Memorial Hospital<br />\nSports Medicine Center<br />\nArthroscopy is a medical<br />\nterm which means \"looking into a joint.\"<br />\nThe term refers to a relatively new procedure which allows<br />\na physician to visually inspect<br />\nthe internal aspect of a joint by<br />\nutilizing a small fiberoptic<br />\ntelescope (\"arthroscope\"). This<br />\ninstrument is introduced into<br />\nthe joint through a small punc1<br />\n4 inch<br />\nture site approximately /<br />\nin length. By maneuvering the<br />\narthroscope within the joint,<br />\nthe entire interior aspect of the<br />\njoint can be directly inspected<br />\nfor abnormalities.<br />\nHistorically, the technique of<br />\narthroscopy was originated in<br />\nJapan in the early 1960's. The<br />\ntechnique was quickly adopted<br />\nby several surgeons in the<br />\nUnited States but it was not until several technological advancements were made that the<br />\nprocedure became more widely utilized. With the development of fiberoptics, better lens<br />\nsystems, and better instrument<br />\ndesign, clear and relatively easy<br />\nvisualization of the internal<br />\naspects of the joints then<br />\nbecame possible.<br />\n' As the knee joint is the<br />\nlargest joint in the body and is<br />\nrelatively prone to injury, arthroscopy was first utilized extensively in the diagnosis of<br />\nknee disorders. Knee disorders<br /><br />\nremain the most common joint<br />\nabnormality for which arthroscopic techniques are<br />\nemployed.<br />\nThe arthroscope has now proven itself to be invaluable in the<br />\ndiagnosis of a variety of knee<br />\nconditions including meniscal<br />\ntears (\"torn cartilage\"), loose<br />\nbodies, ligament injuries, and<br />\narthritis. Because arthroscopy<br />\nallows for direct visualization<br />\nof the joint, in experienced<br />\nhands it has reduced the need<br />\nfor indirect tests such as arthrograms (dye injections into<br />\nthe joint with x-rays).<br />\nArt hroscopic surgery is a<br />\ntechnique by which surgery can<br />\nbe performed using the arthroscope. In this technique,<br />\nsmall instruments are introduced inside the joint through<br />\nother punctures and surgery is<br />\nperformed under the direct<br />\nvisualization afforded by the<br />\narthroscope. Utilizing this<br />\ntechnique, such procedures as<br />\nremoval of a torn menisci,<br />\nloose bodies, and bone spurs<br />\ncan be accomplished, thus<br />\neliminating the need for conventional open sugery.<br />\nThe procedure itself can<br />\nusually be performed on an<br />\noutpatient basis. Arthroscopy is<br />\nperformed in an operating<br />\nroom under sterile conditions.<br />\nWhile art hroscopy of the knee<br />\ncan be performed under local<br />\n(Novocaine) anesthesia, it is<br />\nusually done under general<br />\nanesthesia. The arthroscope<br />\n(and other instruments if need-<br /><br />\ned)are introduced into the knee<br />\nthrough small puncture sites,<br />\neach requiring only one stitch to<br />\nclose following the procedure.<br />\nWith current technology, a<br />\nsmall TV camera can be attached to the scope to allow for<br />\nvisualization of the procedure<br />\non a TV monitor. Video tapes<br />\nof the procedure can thereby be<br />\nmade for permanent records.<br />\nFollowing arthroscopic<br />\nsurgery, most patients are able<br />\nto walk immediately, requiring<br />\nthe use of a cane or crutches for<br />\na few days only. Most patients<br />\nare able to return to athletic activity within four to six weeks<br />\nfollowing this procedure,<br />\ndepending on the type of problem encountered and the type<br />\nof procedure performed.<br />\nSince the techniques for arthroscopy and arthroscopic<br />\nsurgery of the knee have proven<br />\nthemselves to be significant advances in medical technology,<br />\ninvestigation is ongoing to<br />\nassess the role of these techniques in other joint disorders.<br />\nThe use of arthroscopy to<br />\ndiagnose and treat certain<br />\nshoulder disorders has already<br />\nproven itself to be effective.<br />\nArthroscopy has been successfully performed on other<br />\njoints as well, such as the ankle,<br />\nelbow, and wrist. However, the<br />\nrelatively small size and tight<br />\nconfiguration of these joints<br />\nmakes the procedure more difficult and often less rewarding.<br />\nAs further experience is gained<br />\nand tecimology evolves, these<br /><br />\npresent limitations may be<br />\novercome.<br />\nFinally, it must be pointed<br />\nout that arthroscopy and arthroscopic surgery are not applicable to every knee disorder.<br />\nSome knee injuries and diseases<br />\nrequire no surgery while others<br />\nstill require the routine<br />\noperative procedures for treatment. When appropriate,<br />\nhowever, art hroscopy and arthroscopic surgery offer the advantages of fewer risks to the<br />\npatient and reduced recovery<br />\ntime which can be especially important for athletes.<br /><br />\nNo Playoffs For Jaysl<br />\nby Bruce Solitar<br />\nThirty-one<br />\npoints<br />\nby<br />\nWidener forward Leon Jones<br />\nled the Pioneers to a 67-64 victory over the Jays last Saturday<br />\nnight at the athletic center.
