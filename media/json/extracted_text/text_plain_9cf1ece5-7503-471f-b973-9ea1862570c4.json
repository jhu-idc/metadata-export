Mr. Webb-Peploe has resigned from the University.<br />\nA New Rule for Freshmen.<br />\nAn alumnus now holding a position with one of the large corporation in this city, in a letter to THE<br />\nNEWS - LETTER, proposes, among<br />\nother rules, that freshmen attendance at all organization meetings<br />\nof the University's activities, be<br />\nmade compulsory. The suggestion<br />\nappeals at once, because of its<br />\nsoundness and necessity.<br />\nIt comes, too, just at a time when<br />\nthe Student Council is formulating<br />\na \"Code of Freshman Regulations,\"<br />\nand THE NEws - LETTER believes<br />\nthat it should be made into a rule.<br />\nThe men at the helm of the University's activities know how trying<br />\nit is to persuade first-year men to<br />\nbecome interested in some one of<br />\nthe activities. To get a large attendance at the organization meetings requires a personal canvass;<br />\nand then, frequently, the results are<br />\ndisappointing. Such a state of affairs should not exist. It is not<br />\nright that the leaders should \"drum<br />\nup trade\" among freshmen. The<br />\nnew men should be made to realize<br />\nat the outset that they are not only<br />\nwanted, but urged to show an active<br />\ninterest in the affairs of the college.<br />\nThey will not realize this, however, unless it is brought before<br />\nthem emphatically or even forcibly.<br />\nThis, obviously, is not the duty of<br />\nthe leaders of the specific activity;<br />\nit is the duty of the Student Council.<br />\nThen, again, a large freshman interest is necessary to maintain the<br />\ntraditions of the University\u2014espe-<br />\n<br />\ncially is this true at this era of expansion. If the University is to<br />\ngrow, its activities should become<br />\ntfk<br />\nfainumns<br />\n11111111111ho<br />\ncorrespondingly greater. The in=<br />\ncreased number of new men makes<br />\nit evident that the old order must<br />\nbe changed. The days when the<br />\nundergraduate body was just a \"big<br />\nfamily\" are passing. The leaders<br />\ncan no longer reach every individual<br />\nfor a \"little talk on football.\" This<br />\nwas apparent this year, with the<br />\nresult that a great many of the new<br />\nYOUTHS AND YOUNG MEN<br />\nmen are without some \"hobby\"<br />\nREADY TO PUT ON AND MADE 10 MEASURE<br />\nalong sporting, literary or social<br />\n-3<br />\nlines.

In the West it has always<br />\nlooked as though the multiplicity of<br />\ncoaches at Yale should bring great<br />\nresults. As a matter of fact, it has<br />\nbrought ruin.<br />\nLast season there were six different offensive coaches, each with<br />\nhis own theory of play. Shevlin<br />\nwas perhaps the most prominent.<br />\nHe boasts a distinct following that<br />\nbelieves in him utterly, but the<br />\nothers were not far behind. As a<br />\nresult, Yale was taught six different<br />\ntheories of play and naturally could<br />\nnot work any of them. In the Colgate game, where Yale suffered defeat, the eleven, bewildered by varying instructions, quit in despair. If<br />\nthe quarterback had been left alone,<br />\nhe might have saved the day by deciding for himself definitely on<br />\nsomething.

He<br />\nwill make addresses on the Japanese<br />\nbefore universities, legislatures,<br />\nchambers of commerce, boards of<br />\ntrade and other organizations in Baltimore, Athens, Ga.; Montgomery,<br />\nNew Orleans, Jackson, Cleveland,<br />\nDetroit and Buffalo. His second<br />\ntour, beginning April 8, will include<br />\nChicago, Milwaukee, St. Louis,<br />\nKansas City, Omaha and Oklahoma<br />\nCity. The arrangements have been<br />\nmade by the American Association<br />\nfor International Conciliation.<br />\nDr. Mabie spent the summer of<br />\n1913 in Japan lecturing in the universities on \"American Ideals,Character and Life.\" His object was to<br />\ninterpret America to the Japanese,<br />\nJust as, during the previous year,<br />\nDr. Nitobe had interpreted Japan<br />\nto Americans. Dr.Mabie was upusually well received and the lectures<br />\nwere reported to be tremendous<br />\nsuccesses. The Imperial University<br />\nof Tokyo found it impossible to<br />\nmeet satisfactorily the demands for<br />\ntickets of admission to his lectures.<br />\nTributes to his popularity were<br />\ngiven by the Emperor, the President of the House of Peers, the<br />\nMayor of Tokyo and others.<br />\nMore than this, it has often been<br />\nsaid that Dr. Mabie rendered conspicuous services in the interest of<br />\ngood mutual_ understanding between<br />\nthe United States and Japan. Most<br />\nof his eighty lectures were given to<br />\nstudents, who, in that country, are<br />\na most important factor in molding<br />\npublic opinion. His elucidations of<br />\nAmerican institutions and character<br />\nWere published widely in Japan.<br />\nHis accounts of Japanese life, customs and ideals should be no less<br />\ninteresting and valuable to Americans.<br /><br />\nName<br /><br />\nY.

It developed, however, that the reasons<br />\nbacking the senior claim were somewhat more clearly defined, and their<br />\nside of the question was more easily<br />\ndefended because of the fact that<br />\ndramatic opposition to the Monroe<br />\nDoctrine is not possible, and the<br />\ndecision properly went to '14.<br />\nThe most finished presentation<br />\nduring the debate was made by<br />\n\"Joe\" Bartlett, the first speaker for<br />\nthe junior team.

Mr. Webb-Peploe has resigned from the University.<br />\nA New Rule for Freshmen.<br />\nAn alumnus now holding a position with one of the large corporation in this city, in a letter to THE<br />\nNEWS - LETTER, proposes, among<br />\nother rules, that freshmen attendance at all organization meetings<br />\nof the University's activities, be<br />\nmade compulsory. The suggestion<br />\nappeals at once, because of its<br />\nsoundness and necessity.<br />\nIt comes, too, just at a time when<br />\nthe Student Council is formulating<br />\na \"Code of Freshman Regulations,\"<br />\nand THE NEws - LETTER believes<br />\nthat it should be made into a rule.<br />\nThe men at the helm of the University's activities know how trying<br />\nit is to persuade first-year men to<br />\nbecome interested in some one of<br />\nthe activities. To get a large attendance at the organization meetings requires a personal canvass;<br />\nand then, frequently, the results are<br />\ndisappointing. Such a state of affairs should not exist. It is not<br />\nright that the leaders should \"drum<br />\nup trade\" among freshmen. The<br />\nnew men should be made to realize<br />\nat the outset that they are not only<br />\nwanted, but urged to show an active<br />\ninterest in the affairs of the college.<br />\nThey will not realize this, however, unless it is brought before<br />\nthem emphatically or even forcibly.<br />\nThis, obviously, is not the duty of<br />\nthe leaders of the specific activity;<br />\nit is the duty of the Student Council.<br />\nThen, again, a large freshman interest is necessary to maintain the<br />\ntraditions of the University\u2014espe-<br /><br />\ncially is this true at this era of expansion. If the University is to<br />\ngrow, its activities should become<br />\ntfk<br />\nfainumns<br />\n11111111111ho<br />\ncorrespondingly greater. The in=<br />\ncreased number of new men makes<br />\nit evident that the old order must<br />\nbe changed. The days when the<br />\nundergraduate body was just a \"big<br />\nfamily\" are passing. The leaders<br />\ncan no longer reach every individual<br />\nfor a \"little talk on football.\" This<br />\nwas apparent this year, with the<br />\nresult that a great many of the new<br />\nYOUTHS AND YOUNG MEN<br />\nmen are without some \"hobby\"<br />\nREADY TO PUT ON AND MADE 10 MEASURE<br />\nalong sporting, literary or social<br />\n-3<br />\nlines.

In the West it has always<br />\nlooked as though the multiplicity of<br />\ncoaches at Yale should bring great<br />\nresults. As a matter of fact, it has<br />\nbrought ruin.<br />\nLast season there were six different offensive coaches, each with<br />\nhis own theory of play. Shevlin<br />\nwas perhaps the most prominent.<br />\nHe boasts a distinct following that<br />\nbelieves in him utterly, but the<br />\nothers were not far behind. As a<br />\nresult, Yale was taught six different<br />\ntheories of play and naturally could<br />\nnot work any of them. In the Colgate game, where Yale suffered defeat, the eleven, bewildered by varying instructions, quit in despair. If<br />\nthe quarterback had been left alone,<br />\nhe might have saved the day by deciding for himself definitely on<br />\nsomething. Hence Yale wants him<br />\nleft alone.<br /><br />\nSMOOTH EST<br />\nTOBACCO<br />\nT UCKY is the Junior who has found<br /><br />\nVelvet!
