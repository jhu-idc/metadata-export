President<br />\nGoodnow has been fortunate enough to obtain, to make the principle address, the Honorable Calvin<br />\nCoolidge, L. L. D., Vice-President<br />\nof the United States. The program<br />\nfor the Commemoration Day exercises is as follows:<br />\nThe trustees and faculty will assemble at 10:30 o'clock in the hall<br />\nover the main lobby.<br />\nThe official guests are invited to<br />\njoin the academic procession in the<br />\nsame place at 10:30.<br />\nThe Alumni will assemble at<br />\n10.30 in the lower hall on Maryland Avenue, whence they will proceed to reserved seats in the auditorium.<br />\nThe students will meet at 10.15<br />\nin the same room and will proceed,<br />\nunder the direction of the marshals<br />\nto seats reserved for them.

It is the wish<br />\nof President Goodnow that every<br />\nman attend who possibly can. The<br />\nexercises are not only impressive<br />\nand affective, but interesting as<br />\nwell.
