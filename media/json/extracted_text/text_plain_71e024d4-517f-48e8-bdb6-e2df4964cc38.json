A first option according to Cohen, is that of an<br />\nessentially peaceful policy\u2014<br />\n\"tightening the embargo and<br />\nwaiting for complicance on our<br />\nterms.\" This course would accomplish several important objectives, Cohen explained. First and<br />\nforemost, it would save lives. It<br />\nwould also \"maintain the coalition the President has remarkably<br />\nassembled,\" and of course, states<br />\nCohen, as long as the U.S. maintains peace, the U.S \"always has<br />\nthe war option.\"<br />\nThe coalition, he points out, is<br />\n\"quite unprecedented [and]<br />\ncreates the hope that we will curtail further Iraqi aggression. This<br />\nidea rests on the view that<br />\neconomic sanctions can work.\"<br />\nIraq's economic base will<br />\ndissolve once it is unable to sell<br />\noil, explained Cohen. This, in<br />\nturn, will \"force someone in Iraq<br />\nto deal with Sadaam and eventually, Kuwaiti government can<br />\nbe restored, and the \"damage can<br />\nbe undone.\"<br />\nAn alternative to this policy is<br />\nthe war option, according to<br />\nCohen. He points to the<br />\narguments of those in favor of<br />\nwar with Iraq. First, they claim,<br />\n\"Time is not on our side.\"<br />\nForces are operating in the Middle East beyond the control of the<br />\nU.S. The Egyptians and Saudis<br />\nsay the U.S. should go to war<br />\nnow, Cohen stated. \"If we wait,<br />\nwe will concede the initiative to<br />\nSadaam Hussein,\" Cohen<br />\nargued. Hussein may also use terror agianst the Arab states in the<br />\ncoalition, he said. Worst of all,<br />\naccording to Cohen, Sadaam<br />\n\"may offer us a deal that is too<br />\ngood to refuse,\" and which may<br />\nend up hurting the U.S. in the<br />\nlong run.<br />\nOther arguments used by those<br />\nin favor of war, according to<br />\nCohen, point to the fact that there<br />\ncan be \"no return to the status<br />\nquo [since] Kuwait is being<br />\nobliterated as a society.\" Further,<br />\n\"if Iraq survives, Israel is in<br />\ndanger. . .There will be instability in the Persain Gulf no matter<br />\nwhat. The only question is what<br />\nkind.\"<br />\n<br />\nCohen pointed out that in \"the<br />\nlong-run, Iraqi nuclear.. .potential is an enormous hazard,\u2014 and<br />\nhe questions what would happen<br />\nif this episode were to occur two<br />\nyears from now. Finally, Cohen<br />\nexplained, it is \"important to<br />\nestablish a precedent for effective<br />\nuse of force when confronted<br />\nwith this aggession.\"<br />\nAs Cohen views it, Bush has<br />\ntwo advantages in dealing with<br />\nthe crisis in the Gulf. \"He can<br />\nmake hard decisions and he can<br />\nkeep a secret.\" Unfortunately for<br />\nhim, Bush's \"inability to speak<br />\nto the heart of the American people\" reduces the overall effectiveness of the other two<br />\ncharacteristics.<br />\nIn conclusion, Cohen admitted<br />\nthat \"both strategies involve huge<br />\nrisks,\" and that to a certain<br />\ndegree, \"each stand excludes the<br />\nother.\" A policy of war, he said,<br />\nof course precludes peace, and a<br />\nstance of peace for too long of a<br />\ntime will eventually preclude<br />\naction.<br />\n\"This is a time to be grim,\"<br />\nadmonished Cohen. A feeling of<br />\n\"surrealism is caused by an<br />\nabsence of grimness in the<br />\nAmerican people.\" He emphasized that this issue cannot be treated<br />\nin a cavalier manner; it is \"no<br />\ntime to fantasize.\"<br />\n\"All in all,\" Cohen continued,<br />\n\"the alternatives will be stark\u2014<br />\neither for policy disaster or war<br />\nin the Persian Gulf, [disaster<br />\nmeaning] any situation in which<br />\nHussein makes any gains<br />\nwhatsoever.\"<br />\nCohen concluded by quoting<br />\nfrom Winston Churhill's My Early We:\"Never, never, never<br />\npresume any war will be easy.<br />\nOnce war begins, you no longer<br />\ncan control consequences. . .<br />\nThere would not be a war if the<br />\nother man did not also feel he had<br />\na reasonable chance of winning.\"<br />\n<br />\nToo much thyme on your<br />\nhands?

And choosing to kill an unborn child\u2014<br />\nthat's another human being,\" she<br />\nconcluded.<br />\nThe candidates were unable to<br />\nanswer all of the audience's questions because of a lack of time.<br />\nThe speakers were provided,<br />\nhowever, with five minutes for<br />\nclosing remarks.<br />\nBaird presented FBI statistics<br />\nabout the frequency of rape. He<br />\nconcluded by saying, \"I've given<br />\nmy life to this cause. I plead with<br />\nyou to understand\u2014the battle is<br />\nnot abortion, the battle is<br />\nfreedom.\"<br />\nFaucher's statement was more<br />\npersonal, attacking Baird and his<br />\nhistory in Working for the cause.<br />\nShe said, \u2014It bothers me greatly: why is it that he's making his<br />\nincome from the abortion industry?

Ashby said that<br />\nAfrican-Americans and blacks<br />\nfrom other countries account for<br />\nabout seven percent of Hopkins<br />\nundergraduates. She also admitted that she knew of only three<br />\nfull-time professors at Hopkins,<br />\nall teaching in the School of Arts<br />\nand Sciences.<br />\n\"The one or two blacks<br />\nrepresented on the faculty is indicative of the fact that we have<br />\na problem and is justification<br />\nenough for the issue. We do have<br />\na white sort of campus,\"<br />\nVeeraswamy said. Although<br />\nHopkins is not the only college<br />\n<br />\ncampus to experience problems<br />\nwith race, Walters said,<br />\n\"Because we are citizens of this<br />\nuniversity, this is where we<br />\nshould focus our efforts.\"<br />\nAshby agreed, saying,<br />\n\"Hopkins is like a laboratory for<br />\nsocial change where we can learn<br />\nto relate to each other. The Symposium is one of the many events<br />\nthat can help Hopkins students<br />\naddress issues of racism now and<br />\nin the future.\"<br />\nFriedman and Veeraswamy<br />\nsubmitted their idea for the Symposium to the Student Council in<br />\nNovember of last year. As part<br />\nof their proposal, they compiled<br />\na potential list of speakers and<br />\ngoals for the program and outlined a possible budget. Both Friedman and Veeraswamy decided to<br />\nfocus on the media, politics, arts<br />\nand culture, and historical and<br />\ncontemporary perspectives to investigate how race is treated in<br />\nthese<br />\ndifferent<br />\nareas.<br />\nVeeraswamy said, however,<br />\n\"The lines are not so clearcut<br />\nnow.

I'm forjustice, no matter who excellent idea to get students to examine issues in more detail than<br />\nit is for or against. I'm a human being first and foremost, and as the Symposium alone would. This combination of elements makes<br />\nsuch I'm for whoever and whatever benefits humanity as a whole.\" \"Dreams Deferred\" the most ambitious Symposium in recent<br />\n\u2014Malcolm X memory.<br />\nThirty-five years after his death, Malcolm X is<br />\nviewed by many as a hate-monger, an anarchist whose primary goal<br />\nwas nothing less than the physical and spiritual polarization of the<br />\nUnited States. Indeed, Malcolm X spent a good part of his adult life<br />\nadvocating Black Nationalism. As a preacher for the Nation of Islam,<br />\nhe argued that racism was so deeply embedded in American society<br />\nthat the only way for African-Americans to achieve any kind of upward mobility was to construct their own society\u2014a world physically and culturally separate from the one which, as he saw it, was<br />\ndominated completely by whites. Further, he insisted that the \"victories\" of the Civil Rights Movement were nothing more than examples of \"token integration\" that would benefit only a handful of<br />\nAmerica's black population.<br />\nNow, thirty-five years after the deaths of both Malcolm X and Martin Luther King Jr., the quality of life for African-Americans remains<br />\nhazy. Although a greater number of blacks have permeated the middle class and the white-collar professions, suggesting a surge of upward mobility, racially motivated killings and attacks continue to make<br />\nheadlines across the country. The recent trial of Washington Mayor<br />\nMarion Barry hinted at a level of racial polarization in the capital<br />\nthat many Americans thought had vanished after the 1960s. Statutes<br />\nproviding for \"affirmative action\" in education and the workplace<br />\nseem now to hang in the balance as the Supreme Court questions<br />\nthe guiding principles behind them. All of this suggests that black<br />\nAmericans, like every other minority in the United States, are still<br />\nbeing forced to keep their eyes on the \"prize\" of racial equality:<br />\nthey can look, but they can't touch.<br />\nThis fact alone makes the 1990 Milton S. Eisenhower Symposium,<br />\n\"Dreams Deferred: Perspectives on Race Relations,\" a timely and<br />\nsignificant one. Composed of speakers as various as James Meredith<br />\n(who now works as an assistant to Senator Jesse Helms), author Taylor<br />\nBranch, and filmmaker Spike Lee, the program virtually guarantees<br />\na broad sampling of perspectives on what is still referred to as \"the<br />\nmovement.\" Such diverse outlooks guarantee, too, that conflicting views about race in the United States\u2014what the situation is, whom<br />\nit is affecting, and how it might change in the future\u2014will clash on<br />\nthe stage in Shriver Hall. Although Lee and Merideth are almost certain to generate controversy, perhaps the most explosive event of<br />\nthe Symposium will be a panel discussion on \"The Politics of Race,\"<br />\nwhich will bring former Dukakis campaign manager Susan Estrich<br />\nonto the same stage with Ed Rollins, chairman of the National<br />\nRepublican Congressional Committee, along with two other intelligent<br />\nobservers of America's racial zeitgeist.<br />\nThis year's Symposium Chairs, Mark Friedman and Ravi<br />\nVeeraswamy, have assembled an impressive roster of speakers. Better<br />\nstill, the two put together a companion course and film series\u2014an<br />\n<br />\nWhen considering the scope of the Symposium's chosen field,<br />\nhowever, the News-Letter has some reservations about \"Dreams<br />\nDeferred.\" First among these is the question \"Whose Symposium<br />\nis it anyway?\" If it is for the benefit of the Hopkins community\u2014<br />\nstudents, faculty, and staff\u2014then it is too exclusive. Over a quarter<br />\nof Hopkins' students are Asian-Americans; blacks constitute a far<br />\nsmaller slice of the student population. Although this last fact attests<br />\nto the importance of a Symposium about African-American issues,<br />\nit also suggests that the Symposium Chairs might have concentrated<br />\non Asian-American issues entirely, or at least secured more than one<br />\nspeaker to address the subject. As it stands, Bill Wong's November<br />\n29th speech on \"Asian-Americans: Silent, or the Model Minority?\"<br />\nseems tacked onto the Symposium schedule, a break in the program's.<br />\ncontinuity and a bone tossed to an unusually neglected minority. A<br />\nSymposium about the differences between Asian-American cultures<br />\nwould be an excellent idea for next year's program.<br />\nThe News-Letter's second reservation is more a warning than a<br />\ncomplaint. Although the Symposium will parade before you a group<br />\nof formidable intellects who will speak cogently and knowledgably<br />\non their subjects, don't expect the world of them nor of the Symposium. As last year's \"Education on the Edge\" demonstrated, every<br />\nspeaker comes with his or her own agenda, and those agendas don't<br />\nalways relate to the Symposium topic, or even to the titles of their<br />\nspeeches. Some may want to plug books, or sell you on their political<br />\nparty; others may try to rip apart the Reagan or Kennedy administrations. The important thing to realize is that these folks aren't likely<br />\nto simplify the complexities of race. If they do their job, they will<br />\nmultiply them\u2014which is fine, as long as one realizes that there is<br />\nalways more to the picture than these people may suggest.<br />\nAlthough it is painfully complicated, race is also one of the most<br />\npertinent issues in American history and in America present. There's<br />\nmuch to be gained by learning about the Malcolm X's background,<br />\nfor example, or finding out who Vernon Johns and Frederick Douglass<br />\nwere. Just as profitable is reading through Martin Luther King's soaring speeches\u2014or better, hearing recordings of them\u2014and investigating<br />\nRosa Parks's real role in the Montgomery Bus Boycott. There's plenty<br />\nof material, all of it fascinating, and all of it relevent.<br />\nBut while you're sitting there in Shriver,just for kicks, try to count<br />\nthe number of administrators you see\u2014they're usually easy to spot.<br />\nThen, after the talk is over, go up to one and ask what the University is doing about hiring minorities and women. If you don't see any<br />\nadministrators at the Symposium lectures, write a letter to President<br />\nRichardson, or to Deans Armstrong or VandeLinde. Ask them the<br />\nsame question. But do ask them: it would be a shame if the insights<br />\nof the Symposium were lost on those who seem to need them most.<br />\n<br />\nLetters<br />\nThe Miranda Act<br />\nDouglass Barre<br />\nEpisode Five:<br />\nHouse Meeting Head On<br />\nWhen the time for the house<br />\nmeeting came around, Miranda<br />\nwas the only one there. Actually, that wasn't true. Zack was<br />\nthere, asleep on the couch.<br />\nZack had his own apartment,<br />\nMiranda was certain, but weeks<br />\nlike this past one, something in<br />\nthe back of her head caused her<br />\nto doubt its existence. Zack had<br />\nshown up Monday night for their<br />\nweekly Monday night study break<br />\nwatching television, and she<br />\ndidn't think he had been out of<br />\nher sight for more than an hour<br />\nsince then. And it was Thursday<br />\nnight.<br />\nShe smiled fondly at him,<br />\nsleeping, and said, \"Get a life,<br />\nZack.\"<br />\nHe gurgled something in his<br />\nsleep that sounded remarkably<br />\nlike \"touch the puppet head\" and<br />\nrolled over (or at least as much<br />\nas he could roll over on the living room couch.).<br />\nDoris poked her head in from<br />\nthe kitchen. \"I'll be at the<br />\nmeeting in a minute, Miranda,\"<br />\nshe beamed. Doris always<br />\nbeamed. It only heightened<br />\nMiranda's anticipation of the<br />\nweekly house meeting. If there<br />\nwas one thing Miranda liked<br />\nabout living with Carol and Doris<br />\nit was telling Carol and Doris<br />\nhow hard it was to live with them.<br />\nThis week, Miranda really had<br />\na lot of aggression to get out, too.<br />\nShe looked at the tablet in her lap:<br />\n\"I . Dishes. 2. Phone Bill. 3.<br />\nThat eyesore in the front hall.\"<br />\nOver the span of a week, Miranda had noted down at least twelve<br />\nthings about her roommates to<br />\nbitch about, but she knew that, in<br />\nher heart, there was only one<br />\nreason she was so anxious about<br />\nit: David.<br />\nHer boyfriend, who she only<br />\ngot to see for three months out of<br />\nthe year, had joined the army\u2014<br />\nG.I. Bill, so he could affford -to<br />\ngo to school. At this rate, they<br />\nwouldn't be in the same place for<br />\nthe next five years. Where was<br />\n<br />\nthe quality time she was promised after graduation? Miranda<br />\nsimply refused to be an army<br />\nwife.<br />\n\"Really! Just one minute!\"<br />\nDoris shouted from the kitchen.<br />\n\"The cookies are almost ready!\"<br />\n\"No rush, Doris,\" Miranda<br />\nsaid resignedly. \"The prodigal<br />\nroommate isn't back yet.\"<br />\nThe front door opened. \"I'm<br />\nback!\" Carol cried.<br />\n\"I would never have guessed,\"<br />\nMiranda muttered.<br />\n\"Great. I've got some cookies<br />\nhere, Carol.\"<br />\nDoris walked in the room with<br />\na cookie tray covered with<br />\n<br />\nDoris walked into<br />\nthe room with a cookie<br />\ntray covered with<br />\ncharred lumps<br />\n<br />\ncharred lumps that appeared to<br />\ncontain oatmeal.<br />\n\"Pass,\" Miranda said.<br />\nCarol walked in and sat on the<br />\nseat opposite the couch. \"So are<br />\nwe starting?\" she asked<br />\nimpatiently.<br />\nMiranda repressed the urge to<br />\nimpale her on Doris' spatula.<br />\n\"Yes, let's do.\"<br />\nDoris plopped herself into one<br />\nof the dining table chairs.<br />\n\"Cookies, anyone'?\"<br />\n\"Pass,\" Miranda repeated,<br />\nhoping that Doris wouldn't recall<br />\nthat she hadn't eaten anything<br />\nDoris had cooked in months.<br />\n\"No, I'm full.

In Paul's attempt to make a<br />\ngeneralization about the military, he<br />\nincorrectly assumes I am a member<br />\nof this force. If I were a cadet,<br />\n<br />\nperhaps I would identify myself as<br />\none, as Mr. Bateman did. I defend<br />\nROTC because I see it as important<br />\nto the people of the United States,<br />\nnot because I am one of its direct<br />\nbeneficiaries.<br />\nSecondly, the president of GALA<br />\nimplies that direct pressure to the<br />\ngovernment is the only way to solve<br />\nthis problem, yet General Counsel<br />\nEstelle Fishbein states, also in last<br />\nweeks News-Letter, that she has not<br />\nbeen approached about the ROTCGALA problem in her fifteen years<br />\nof service.

John Kennedy<br />\nsigned an Executive Order<br />\nwith such intentions, requiring<br />\ngovernment contractors to<br />\n\"take affirmative action to ensure that the applicants are<br />\nemployed, and that the<br />\nemployees are treated during<br />\nemployment without regard to<br />\nrace, creed, color, or national<br />\norigin.\"<br />\nIn practice, however, affirmative action differs completely with Kennedy's intentions.<br />\nToday, as a result of affirmative action, applicants and<br />\nemployees are treated with exacting regard to race or cOlor.<br />\nWhites resent this form of<br />\nlegalized discrimination.

But don't be<br />\nfooled by its title. This film is not<br />\nabout Roxy Carmichael or the<br />\nCenter for Cosmetology and<br />\nDrama she is opening up in her<br />\nhometown of Clyde, Ohio.<br />\nRather, this is the story of how<br />\nthat homecoming affects the<br />\nsleepy little town, and specifically<br />\none person, Dinky Bosetti<br />\n(Winona Ryder).<br />\nDinky is the mixed-up adopted<br />\n\"kid eccentric\" of the town. She<br />\nalways dresses in black, talks to<br />\nanimals, has chains and bolts on<br />\nher bedroom door(but leaves her<br />\nwindow open), and is generally<br />\nconsidered to be a bit weird by<br />\nmost everyone. To say that Dinky<br />\nis somewhat unhappy with her<br />\nlife is like saying Russia is \"kinda big.\" Dinky hates her mother,<br />\nfeels estranged from her father,<br />\nand is scorned by almost<br />\neveryone in school. Her parents<br />\nwant to send her to a school for<br />\n\"socially<br />\ndysfunctional\"<br />\nstudents.<br />\nDinky has other ideas. After<br />\n<br />\ntalking with Denton Webb (Jeff<br />\nDaniels), Roxy's former<br />\nboyfriend, about the baby they<br />\ngave up for adoption, Dinky<br />\nbecomes obsessed with the idea<br />\nthat she is the child of Denton and<br />\nRoxy. She concocts a plan to<br />\nescape Clyde by petitioning Roxy<br />\nto take her away from all this. To<br />\n<br />\nHollywood where we see silent<br />\nscenes of Roxy swimming, packing to leave for Clyde, riding to<br />\nthe airport.<br />\nThe movie moves toward its<br />\nfocal point, the gala Roxy Ball to<br />\nbe held at the Cosmetology and<br />\nDrama Center that Friday evening. Dinky gets herself in and out<br />\n<br />\nDinky is the mixed-up kid<br />\neccentric who dressed in black,<br />\ntalks to animals, has chains and<br />\nbolts on her bedroom door, and is<br />\ngenerally considered to be a bit<br />\nweird by almost everyone.<br />\nthis end she starts imitating<br />\nRoxy's habits. She develops a<br />\npenchant for pink (just like Roxy)<br />\nand goes as far as stealing Roxy's<br />\nshoelaces from the shrine/<br />\nmuseum the town has made out<br />\nof Roxy's old house.<br />\nWhile all this is going on in<br />\nClyde, every so often we cut to<br />\n<br />\nof trouble wandering about Clyde<br />\ncaught up in the idea that Roxy<br />\ncould be her mother. During the<br />\ncourse of the week Gerry<br />\nHowells(T. Wilson Brown), the<br />\nmost popular boy in school,<br />\nbegins to fall in love with her.<br />\nAs Dinky runs about mooning<br />\nover Roxy, Gerry runs about<br />\n<br />\nmooning over Dinky. The rest of<br />\nthy town should be so happy. All<br />\nthe town women are in an uproar<br />\ntrying to compete. One woman,<br />\nEvelyn, who was always jealous<br />\nof Roxy, decides to get her hair<br />\ncolored to look like Roxy's with,<br />\nah, interesting results.<br />\nThe performances in Roxy Carmichael are good enough to make<br />\nthis fanciful story work. Winona<br />\nRyder is perfect as the awfullyweird Dinky, and Graham Beckel<br />\ntruly becomes Dinky's tender,<br />\nconfused, and dominated father.<br />\nT. Wilson Brown's performance<br />\nas Gerry begins weakly, but<br />\nmanages to pull itself up by the<br />\nfilm's end. The acting done by<br />\nFrances Fisher, as Dinky's mom,<br />\nhowever, is unforgivable; it is<br />\nboth shallow and false.<br />\nBut the film as a whole is truly<br />\nhilarious and very touching. As<br />\nthe audience watches the<br />\ntownspeople dance about in confusion, slaves to devotion of their<br />\nlocal god, they learn much about<br />\nthemselves. All their dreams and<br />\ndesires hinge upon Roxy's<br />\nhomecoming. Does Dinky get a<br />\nmother? Will Roxy even notice<br />\nDenton, who is ruining his mar-<br />\n<br />\n(1.1)1.

You watch these performers smiling and sweating<br />\nduring the encores and there is no<br />\nquestion in your mind that they<br />\nhave worked hard.<br />\nThe Randy Warshaw Dance<br />\nCompany made its Baltimore<br />\ndebut this past weekend as the<br />\nfirst performance in the \"Dance<br />\non the Edge\" series, taking place<br />\nat the Baltimore Museum of Art.<br />\nWarshaw has been pointed out as<br />\none of the rising stars of the contemporary dance scene, and his<br />\ncompany of dancers is worthy of<br />\nsimilar acclaim for its energetic<br />\nperformance of two very different<br />\nworks.<br />\nTheir performance was visually<br />\nand acoustically stunning. In<br />\n\"Event Horizon,\" the first of two<br />\npieces performed, the set of six<br />\ndancers move in vibrant, quicklychanging patterns of alternation.<br />\nIn moments, there is a slow shif-<br />\n<br />\nting of balance and weight, then<br />\na passionate turn and an athletic<br />\nleap, which lands to become an<br />\nethereal slide. A fast, rigid figure<br />\nsuddenly becomes limp, losing<br />\nstrength and sagging slowly<br />\nbeneath the force of gravity. Interaction between dancers<br />\nchanges rapidly as well. They<br />\nwill move freely and independently, only to jump and<br />\nsnap into the arms of another<br />\npassing dancer. On occasion, one<br />\ndancer becomes the moulder of<br />\nanother, forming motions in the<br />\nother with their hands. There is<br />\na sense of organic interlocking<br />\nbetween the dancers, of spontaneity and complementarity. The<br />\nmusical background is an electronic psycho-funk score which<br />\nalternates pulsing jazz and funk<br />\nrhythms with nostalgic violin<br />\nphrases, frequently interrupted by<br />\nthe metallic rattling of drums and<br />\nwhat sound like power tools. In<br />\nperformance, the lighting is able<br />\nto work subtle emotional effects,<br />\nshifting hues as the feeling of the<br />\ndance changes. During the lyrical<br />\nviolins, the dancers move with<br />\nthe stately rigidity of wind-blown<br />\ntrees, and the stage is bathed in<br />\n<br />\nDancers in tile Randy Warshaw Company experiment with<br />\ninterlocking forms in a gymnastic performance.<br />\n<br />\nblue. Conflict erupts with the<br />\ndancers pushing and pulling, the<br />\ninstruments scream, and lights<br />\nglare orange. By the end of the<br />\npiece, you are left exhausted and<br />\nawake.<br />\nThe second piece performed<br />\nwas \"Fragile Anchor,\" whose<br />\nmood and movement replace<br />\n\"Event Horizon's\" conflict with<br />\na grand, living quality. The<br />\ndancers enter in flowing,<br />\ngossamer clothes, turning serenely about the stage in delicately<br />\nsynchronized movements. There<br />\nis free and constant motion. Arms<br />\noutstretched, they twirl, leap,<br />\nsweep their hands slowly along<br />\nthe ground. For several large portions of the piece, one performer<br />\ndances alone in a vibrant isolation, or two dancers engage in<br />\ngently interlocking pas de deux.<br />\nIn contrast to the music of the jar-<br />\n<br />\nring, violent \"Event Horizon,\"<br />\nthe soundtrack is the rich and<br />\njoyful Quartet for Strings and<br />\nMarimba, calling forth a kind of<br />\nquiet order. At one point, the<br />\nmusic turns toward the Middle<br />\nEastern themes, and the<br />\nmovements evoke the stiff<br />\nelegance of an ancient Egyptian<br />\npainting. In others, the eerie<br />\nplucking of a guitar may accompany dancers struggling in slowmotion, beneath a deep, undersea<br />\nblue. The piece ends with more<br />\nfree-flowing contact, with<br />\ndancers rolling into handstands,<br />\nflipping and turning over each<br />\nother's backs.<br />\nViewing modern dance, or indeed any kind of dance outside of<br />\na HOP event, is likely to be a<br />\nrelatively challenging experience.<br />\nIt's because dance is a form of art<br />\nthat accesses our oldest and most<br />\n<br />\npersonal symbol in its expression:<br />\nour bodies. It's a symbol that<br />\nwe're not used to reading, and<br />\nyou may be able to say, as I can,<br />\nthat you honestly did not understand anything Randy Warshaw<br />\nmeant to say by choreographing<br />\nthese excellent pieces. But you<br />\nmay feel something, and maybe<br />\nyou'll be left exhilarated without<br />\n<br />\nknowing exactly why.<br />\nThe \"Dance on the Edge\"<br />\nseries continues November 16-18<br />\nwith Maureen Fleming's performance of\"Water on the Moon,\"<br />\nan eerie and elegant minimalist<br />\nwork inspired by Japanese butoh,<br />\nthe aesthetic of precisely controlled movements.

The plot takes a sharp<br />\nturn to the ridiculous when a<br />\ndopey, out-of-work actor (Todd<br />\nRooney) attempts to secure the<br />\nnude part, no matter what risk to<br />\nhis personal pride. In the, end,<br />\nBarnstable's goal has been accomplished without any actual<br />\nnudity on the stage, and we see<br />\nman in all his foolishness and<br />\nincompetence.<br />\nAs Barnstable, Tim Woodard<br />\ngives an extremely polished performance as Artist Without Compromise.

The plot was typical John<br />\nHughes material: geeky nerds and<br />\nplain girls pitted against football<br />\nstuds and makeup queens.<br />\nMarke, Jr. has a good ear for<br />\ncomic dialogue and obviously put<br />\na lot of thought into the Arthurian<br />\nsymbolism, but he ends up covering no new ground.<br />\nLuckily, the cast of the play is<br />\na talented one. Arthur and Meg<br />\n(Eric Jeffries and Carla Berg), the<br />\nmain couple, are both likeable<br />\nand fairly uninhibited in their acting, as is Jennifer (AnnMarie<br />\nDeFiglio). Andrew Roy's<br />\nLance,<br />\nhormone-packed<br />\nhowever, is the real standout.-He<br />\n<br />\nmanages to make his character at<br />\nonce bone-headed and endearing.<br />\n\"Tell me what to say,\" he pleads<br />\nto his girlfriend at one point. \"I'll<br />\nmean it.\"<br />\nThe last play, Jean Anouilh's<br />\n\"Cecile, or The School for<br />\nFathers,\" is in some ways one of<br />\nthe best and yet most frustrating<br />\nof the four. In line with conventional French comedy,\"Cecile\"<br />\ntells the tale of a proper father<br />\nwho is caught in a contradiction:<br />\nhow to protect his daughter's<br />\nhonor and court her governess at<br />\nthe same time. At the play's<br />\nsomewhat flat climax, the cast ,<br />\nmembers are all running around<br />\nin the dark disguised as each<br />\nsome<br />\ncausing<br />\nother,<br />\nmisunderstandings.<br />\nAs Monsieur Orlas the father,<br />\nWilliam L. Houston, III is the<br />\nOne-Acts' most promising figure.<br />\nHouston struts and prances about<br />\nthe stage with an outrageously<br />\nfunny French accent; he is a joy<br />\n<br />\nto watch even when he's doing<br />\nnothing. The problem is that<br />\nnobody in the cast can match him,<br />\nand the play is left a bit one-sided.<br />\nRenata Perrone as the scheming<br />\ngoverness Araminthe comes close<br />\nbut needs a little more bite; and<br />\nthe daughter's foppish cover<br />\n(Parviez Hosseini), while amusing in his own right, renders<br />\nmany of his lines incomprehensible. Only Giang Nguyen as the<br />\nancient fellow-father Monsieur<br />\nDamiens provides a good foil for<br />\nHouston, but he emerges too late<br />\nin the action to make up for some<br />\nof the wasted time.<br />\nWhatever their minor faults,<br />\nthis year's Freshman One-Acts<br />\nhave provided the Hopkins cornmunity with some fine moments.<br />\nEven if these actors don't take to<br />\nthe stage again, they will find that<br />\ntheir achievements won't soon be<br />\nforgotten.<br />\n<br />\nATTENTION!!

This<br />\nyear he ran for the Maryland<br />\nHouse of Delegates.<br />\nAlthough Henry did not win a<br />\nseat in the legislature, the<br />\nHopkins senior learned a great<br />\ndeal from the experience and<br />\nplans to run for political office<br />\nagain.<br />\n\"I had not expected to be running alone against the incumbents,\" said Henry. Instead,<br />\nhe ran against the district's three<br />\nincumbents, who ran as a ticket<br />\nalong with the district's State<br />\nSenator and five other candidates.<br />\n<br />\nAccording to Henry, during the<br />\nbeginning of the campaign, the<br />\nticket just ignored him. Then,<br />\nafter he received some publicity<br />\nfrom the Baltimore Sun, the other<br />\ncandidates were forced to pay attention. Then, \"they outspent<br />\nme. Badly.\"<br />\nBut Henry believes that the<br />\ncampaign was worthwhile for the<br />\nname recognition and experience<br />\nhe gained. He was also very encouraged by the amount of support he had from other students.<br />\n\"One night, the members of<br />\nthe ticket and I were campaigning in the same area. They had<br />\nmore people total, but I had five<br />\nor six people campaigning with<br />\n<br />\nme, whereas each of the other<br />\ncandidates had only brought one<br />\nother person.\"<br />\nAs for what made him decide<br />\nto run in the first place. Henry<br />\nlists two reasons. First, his career<br />\nobjective is government service,<br />\n\"preferably elected office.\"<br />\nSecondly, he chose to run for<br />\nthe House of Delegates this year<br />\nbecause \"it was the first office I<br />\nwas old enough to run for.\"<br />\nHe wants to run for the<br />\nBaltimore, City Council, but he<br />\nwill not announce his candidacy<br />\nofficially until redistricting is<br />\ncompleted in February of next<br />\nyear.<br />\nHenry intends to start his cam<br />\n<br />\npaign earlier next year. He also<br />\nplans to talk to more people as<br />\nwell as making sure that they<br />\nhave \"something with his name<br />\non it in their hands on election<br />\nday.\"<br />\nHenry would also like to run on<br />\na ticket with other candidates the<br />\nnext time. He plans to concentrate<br />\non education, a city recycling<br />\npolicy, and crime, among other<br />\nissues.<br />\nHenry said he also learned two<br />\nvery important things which he<br />\nwill apply to his 1991 campaign.<br />\nFirst, he said with a smile, he will<br />\nbuy shoes with arch supports.

For those who wanted<br />\ngames but did not feel like<br />\ncreating characters, there were<br />\nothers such as Wizards and<br />\nCosmic Encounter. And, of<br />\ncourse, there were the oldfashioned board games of chess<br />\nand Monopoly, as well as<br />\nnumerous card games.<br />\nWhy all the excitement over<br />\nsome games? Well, this is one of<br />\nHopSFA's major fundraisers of<br />\nthe year, and it is always lots of<br />\nfun. Last year was the first<br />\nFallmeet, and its success has<br />\nmade it a new tradition. This<br />\nyear's meet was very similar to<br />\nthe last although there was one<br />\nmajor feature missing: the masquerade ball.<br />\nInterested students and outsiders wandered over the Glass<br />\nPavilion on Saturday to discover<br />\nof<br />\nlarge<br />\nnumber<br />\na<br />\noptions for play. Many people<br />\ndied during the day, but no one<br />\n.scented to care. It was all a game.<br />\n----When people grew tired of<br />\nplaying, there were the merchants. The Armory sent over<br />\nseveral weapons which drew<br />\ngreat amounts of attention. And,<br />\n<br />\nsince it was a gaming convention,<br />\nthere was of course a merchant<br />\nselling games. \"The Greatest<br />\nAdventure,\" a new gaming store<br />\non Charles Street, was present to<br />\nshow off (and sell) all sorts of<br />\n<br />\nMany people died<br />\nduring the day,<br />\nbut no one seemed<br />\nto care.

Everyone seemed to go<br />\naway happy, and plans are<br />\nalready underway tor next year's<br />\nmeet.<br />\nSo come next fall, again<br />\nthere'll be the clicking of dice,the<br />\nshuffling of cards, and deaths and<br />\ntreasures galore. But one small<br />\npiece of advice to those who attend: \"Never argue with a<br />\ndragon.\"<br />\n<br />\nFood for Thought: The Polo Grill<br />\nby Jessica Maxwell<br />\nLooking for somewhere to eat<br />\nwhen your parents come down<br />\nfor Parents' Weekend next week?<br />\nYou may want to consider this<br />\nweek's Food for Thought. . .The<br />\nPolo Grill at the Colonnade. According to the City Paper, this is<br />\n\"The Most Elitist Restaurant\" in<br />\nBaltimore, as well as having the<br />\nbest wine list and the best dinner<br />\nfor over $75 in the Best of<br />\nBaltimore edition.<br />\nThis is all very evident as soon<br />\nas you walk in. The theme of the<br />\ndecor is hunting, and the dominant color is green. The only flaw<br />\nI call see with the design is that<br />\nin order to get to your table, you<br />\nmust go through the bar area.<br />\nOtherwise, the atmosphere would<br />\nbe four stars.<br />\nFor an appetizer, I recommend<br />\nWoodland<br />\nthe American<br />\nMushroom Tartlette ($5.95).<br />\nThis stuffed mushroom cap is<br />\nwonderful. They also have as an<br />\nappetizer Jumbo Gulf Shrimp<br />\n($7.50). I also recommend this,<br />\nas it is equally good.<br />\nFor entrees, the menu offers a<br />\nvariety of selections. I strongly<br />\nrecommend the Penne Pasta<br />\n($13.95), which consists of pasta<br />\nwith red peppers, tomatoes and<br />\nlentils. It is excellent. Also good<br />\nis the Poached Salmon ($29.50),<br />\nas well as Panos & Paul's<br />\nFamous Fried Lobster Tail<br />\n($36.00). After speaking to a few<br />\nnative Marylanders, the .only<br />\nseafood that was not recommended to me was the Crab Cake Platter ($29.50).<br />\nAfter dinner, there are several<br />\ndesserts worth trying. They range<br />\nin price from reasonable to expensive, including Bavarian<br />\nCream Pie, Flourless Chocolate<br />\nCake, and Strawberry Shortcake.<br />\nOverall, I liked the Polo Grill.<br />\nThe servers were never out of<br />\narm's reach, the entrees were<br />\nbrought promptly, and I didn't<br />\n<br />\ntel rushed. The drawbacks to the<br />\nPolo Grill are that it's expensive<br />\nand that you need reservations. If<br />\nyou want to try the Polo Grill and<br />\ndon't have unlimited funds, two<br />\npeople can get a good lunch for<br />\naround twenty dollars. Notables<br />\non the lunch menu are the Caesar<br />\nsalad and the spinach salad, both<br />\nunder ten dollars.<br />\n<br />\n411- ;PJ<br />\nesteet,<br />\n\u2022<br />\n<br />\nThe Polo Grill<br />\nThe Inn at the Colonnade<br />\n4 West University Parkway<br />\n235-8200<br />\nAtmosphere: *** 1/2<br />\nFood: ****<br />\nPrice: $$$$<br />\nOverall: ****<br />\n<br />\nformerly...<br />\nBella Roma<br />\n<br />\nI'v'i<br />\n1.<br />\n1<br />\n\u2018<br />\n<br />\nCBS<br />\nDRIVERS WANTED<br />\n<br />\nBaltimore's<br />\nLargest Slice!!<br />\n<br />\nHaughty cuisine Donna Williamson<br />\nThe Polo Grill: Where the elite meet<br />\nto eat really expensive meat.<br />\n<br />\n(Sold until 4:00 pm)<br />\n<br />\n3600 Keswick Road<br />\n235-2595<br />\n<br />\nby Sarah Freeman<br />\nOn September 26 the JHU<br />\nGospel Choir performed at the<br />\nclosing night of the musical<br />\n\"Mama Don't\" at the Lyric<br />\ntheatre 4owntown. That night the<br />\nchoir was proud to be in the company of Gospel greats such as the<br />\nHawkins Family and the Clark<br />\nSisters. As a result of that spectacular night several of the singers<br />\nin the choir have been asked to<br />\naudition for the musical's future<br />\nperformances.<br />\nKevin Rodgers smiles sincerely<br />\nand enthusiastically when he talks<br />\nabout the Gospel Choir. He has<br />\nbeen the director of the choir for<br />\nthe past two years and he has watched it gain increasing recognition within the Baltimore<br />\ncommunity.<br />\nThe most unique feature of the<br />\nchoir is its sincere attempt at<br />\nuniting Johns Hopkins students<br />\nwith the rest of the Baltimore<br />\n<br />\ncommunity. But Rodgers also<br />\nemphasizes that aside from bringing unity to the community, he<br />\nalso hopes to spread a deeper<br />\nsense of goodwill within the<br />\nworld. He wants to use the choir<br />\nas a vehicle for spreading Christianity through song.<br />\nThe singing..is mainly focused<br />\non spirituals, anthems and<br />\nhymns, although Rodgers emphasizes that spontaneity is key.<br />\nHe likes to introduce new songs<br />\nto the repertoire.<br />\nThe choir's next major performance at JHU will be November<br />\n25 in Shriver Hall.

Erik Mont's<br />\nthree touchdowns catapulted<br />\nHopkins to a 28-7 romp over the<br />\nMuhlenberg Mules. The win improved the Blue Jays' record to<br />\n3-3 overall and 2-2 in the<br />\nconference.<br />\n\"We go as our defense goes,\"<br />\nsaid Head Coach Jim Margraff.<br />\n\"We were a very good football<br />\nteam defensively for four<br />\nquarters. Offensively, we hurt<br />\nourselves early, but once we<br />\neliminated the turnovers, we took<br />\ncontrol of the game and did a very<br />\nnice job.\"<br />\nThe offense played its most<br />\n<br />\nLacrosse Loses Classic to Tigers<br />\nScrimmage Used to Heal Injured, Evaluate New Players<br />\nby Jay Friedman<br />\nAlthough the men's lacrosse<br />\nteam entered the CHOICE Visa<br />\nLacrosse classic last weekend<br />\nhoping to win, head coach Tony<br />\nSeaman was content to use the<br />\ntournament for what it really<br />\nis\u2014 exhibition. The Blue Jays<br />\nsuffered a 12-7 loss at the hands<br />\nof the Towson State Tigers.<br />\nHowever, Seaman was not<br />\nbroken up over his first loss as<br />\nHopkins coach. \"We definitely<br />\nwanted to play Sunday [in the<br />\nchampionship game against<br />\nLoyola] but my intent was to use<br />\nthis as an opportunity to evaluate<br />\nour program. This was a scrimmage. I used it as a chance to<br />\nevaluate new players and heal the<br />\ninjured ones.\"<br />\nMake no mistake, the injured<br />\nplayers could have had a significant impact on the outcome of the<br />\ngame. However, they were never<br />\nexpected to play in the Classic<br />\nand the coaching staff had no<br />\ndesire to use injuries as an excuse<br />\nfor the lackluster performance.<br />\n\"Of course we weren't as successful as we wanted to be. We<br />\ncould have given the ball to all the<br />\nright people and come out with<br />\na one goal win, but then we<br />\nwouldn't know what to work on.<br />\nWe weren't going to change our<br />\nphilosophy for a pre-season<br />\ngame,\" Seaman said. That<br />\nphilosophy is what allowed over<br />\nthirty players to see action.<br />\nHopkins entered the Classic<br />\nagainst a hungry Tiger team.<br />\nTSU coach Carl Runk was disappointed the Tigers did not earn a<br />\ntournament bid after last season's<br />\n11-2 record (losing only to<br />\nLoyola and Hopkins), \"but that's<br />\nnot the focus this year,\" he said.<br />\nThe Tigers return their top nine<br />\nscorers of a year ago. Scoring<br />\nsensation Glenn Smith anchored<br />\na seasoned attack unit that has<br />\nbeen playing together for three<br />\nyears. Even their second string<br />\nattack is solid. The first line<br />\nreturns intact led by senior AllAmerican Rob Shek who scored<br />\nthirty goals last season. While the<br />\nteam lost All-Conference players<br />\nin goalie David\u2022 Linthicum and<br />\ndefenseman Ben Keesey,they obtained an All-American in junior<br />\ncollege transfer goalie Richard<br />\nBetcher.<br />\nTrue to form, the TSU offense<br />\nexcelled and Betcher was solid in<br />\ngoal. Smith scored the game<br />\nopener less than two minutes after<br />\nthe start of the game and added<br />\ntwo more in the third quarter.<br />\nShek added two more as did<br />\nMichael DeSimone. Betcher<br />\nmade several sparkling one-onone saves in holding the Jays to<br />\nonly seven goals.<br />\nFortunately there were several<br />\nbright spots for Hopkins.<br />\nAlthough not readily apparent by<br />\nthe score, the close defense<br />\nplayed a steady game led by<br />\njunior goalie Scott Giardina.<br />\nSeaman was understandably happy about the defensive play. \"I<br />\nthink one thing we proved is we<br />\nhave a quality Division I goalie<br />\n<br />\nwho can play this game for<br />\nanyone,\" he said. \"I think the<br />\none place we got hurt was in transition. We played a good settled<br />\ndefense.\" Indeed, the team<br />\nallowed four transition goals,<br />\nthree man-down goals (an area<br />\nwhich has not been practiced<br />\nmuch yet) and one in the closing<br />\nminute of the game. Considering<br />\nthe variety of defenses played<br />\n(five), the number of different<br />\nplayers (and units) utilized, and<br />\nthe number of goals allowed in<br />\nsettled situations (four, of which<br />\ntwo were screens), the close<br />\ndefense and goalie positions appear strong.<br />\nOne area Seaman thought<br />\nneeds work is on attack. \"Our<br />\nonly breakdown was our inabilityit h4ndle the ball offensively,\"<br />\nhe said. The dropped passes,<br />\noverthrown balls and elusive<br />\nground balls were costly for<br />\nHopkins as they allowed the<br />\nTigers several unsettled goals in<br />\nthese situations. However,junior<br />\nattackman Jeff Wills managed the<br />\nJays' two first half goals and<br />\nassisted on three others. Also<br />\nfiguring in the scoring for<br />\nHopkins were Brian Tobin,<br />\nCharlie Speno, Adam Wright,<br />\nDrew Burns, and David Town-<br />\n<br />\nsend who each scored once and<br />\nTodd Cavallaro who contributed<br />\non assist.<br />\nIn a clear indication cif the<br />\n\"Seaman Era,\" the team played<br />\nseveral defensive schemes(mostly versions of a zone), a fast<br />\nbreak offense (that had its<br />\ntroubles handling the pall) and<br />\nmiddies raced into defensh,e positions rather than the previous<br />\nyears' waving stick checks at<br />\nmidfield. Seaman was quick to<br />\npoint out the inexperience of the<br />\n<br />\nteam in the new system. \"This<br />\nwas only our second game against<br />\na different color jersey [the first<br />\nbeing a week earlier at Duke].<br />\nLast time we handled things well<br />\nbut now we know what to work<br />\non. We have to tone up offensively and get guys healthy for the<br />\nspring.\"<br />\nAccording to Seaman the team<br />\nis gearing up for the annual<br />\nVarsity-Alumni game Saturday<br />\nnight.

Going into this past<br />\nweek, they were coming off a<br />\n3-0-1 record in their last four<br />\nstarts, scoring nine goals in the<br />\nprocess while only allowing two.<br />\nThroughout this stretch they have<br />\nbeen playing with poise as well.<br />\nThe offense has managed to<br />\ncreate some stunning goals, while<br />\nthe defense has continued its<br />\nstellar play. But this, however,<br />\nwas before they entered contests<br />\nwith two of their toughest<br />\nchallenges of the season, Swarthmore and Mary Washington.<br />\nSaturday, October 13\u2014<br />\nSwarthmore College encroached the \"monster\" turf, where<br />\npreviously Hopkins was unbeaten<br />\nand unscored upon(8 goals-0). In<br />\nthe MAC Southeastern Championship last season, the Blue<br />\nJays defeated Swarthmore 1-0 on<br />\npenalty kicks and were looking on<br />\nthis rainy Saturday night to keep<br />\nup the winning tradition. A win<br />\nwould keep them in the running<br />\nfor the MAC Southeast title, and<br />\na possible, if however slim,<br />\nchance for an NCAA bid.<br />\nThe first half saw Swarthmore<br />\nopen up by attempting to take<br />\ncontrol of the game early. They<br />\nattacked the Hopkins side often,<br />\nwith all but two defensemen, in<br />\nhopes of opening up the scoring<br />\nearly. Hopkins was reserved to<br />\n<br />\nsitting back in more of 4 defensive mode and waiting for its opportunities. While they were content to wait, their unusual fan support for this game, led by the<br />\nfraternity Alpha Tau Omega, was<br />\nnot. ATO was indeed rowdy at<br />\nthis game, but they did indeed<br />\nadd to the flavor in a positive<br />\nway.<br />\nRising to the occasion under<br />\nthe Swarthmore pressure was<br />\nHopkins junior goalkeeper Jerry<br />\nIrvine, who managed to play the<br />\nslick astro-turf to perfection. Irvine came into the Swarthmore<br />\ngame with a .91 goals against<br />\naverage. Midway through the<br />\nfirst half, Swarthmore scored an<br />\napparent goal which for a moment ended the home field<br />\ndomination. This goal was<br />\ndisallowed, however, because of<br />\na Swarthmore penalty. But this<br />\nwas all Swarthmore would<br />\nmanage, for the Hopkins squad<br />\ntook over control of the game<br />\nsoon after this play. The first half<br />\nscore ended with a 0-0 tie, and<br />\nwith Hopkins knowing that they<br />\nhad to keep up the constant<br />\npressure and do something in the<br />\nsecond half to pull out the win.<br />\nA tie in this game would not help<br />\nthem in the MAC standings.<br />\nThe mood in the second half<br />\nwas extremely tense. While the<br />\nconstant chatterings from ATO<br />\nwere upbeat, and the Blue Jays attack was upbeat, they were still<br />\nnot managing to put the ball into<br />\nthe back of the net. Hopkins did<br />\nkeep the pressure on, barely<br />\nmissing on several close chances.<br />\nOne of these was a pass off a free<br />\n<br />\nkick which junior Omar<br />\nNicholson headed off the<br />\ncrossbar. Junior forward, Scott<br />\nWilson, came off the bench in the<br />\nsecond half and kept the Hopkins<br />\noffense running. Wilson's<br />\nballhandling abilities create excitement and almost led to a<br />\nHopkins goal. \"Swarthmore was<br />\nvery lucky in that some of our<br />\nshots were just off,\" commented<br />\nHopkins coach Mark Butler.<br />\nWith fifteen minutes to play,<br />\nthe nervousness of the Hopkins<br />\nteam was evident. By this time<br />\nthey were very frustrated by the<br />\nfact that they had still not scored.<br />\nThe Hopkins bench by this time<br />\nwas standing up, reacting to each<br />\nplay like it was the last play of the<br />\nseason. Hopkins coach Butler<br />\nshowed some emotion as well,<br />\nputting his hand to his chest and<br />\nlooking up to the sky just after<br />\nSwarthmore missed a scoring<br />\nopportunity.<br />\nWhat followed seemed like it<br />\nwas destined from the beginnng<br />\nof the game. The constant attack<br />\nand creative playmaking of the<br />\nHopkins forwards paid off. With<br />\njust under eleven minutes to play,<br />\nsenior co-captain Warren Jones<br />\nstood outside of the eighteen yard<br />\nbox with a free kick awaiting.<br />\nJones played the ball on the<br />\nground into the mass of players<br />\nstanding inside the box. Hopkins<br />\njunior forward Myles Flynn proceeded to fake a shot over the ball<br />\nand let the ball pass through his<br />\nlegs. This froze the Swarthmore<br />\ndefense and goalkeeper and the<br />\nball rolled leisurely into the left<br />\nContinued on page 17<br />\n<br />\nconsistent game of the year,<br />\ndespite three early interceptions<br />\nfrom Scott Cade. With Paul Ferreri still recovering from a<br />\nshoulder injury, Mont received<br />\nthe bulk of the running chores.<br />\nThe fullback did not disappoint,<br />\nas he rumbled for 93 yards on 16<br />\ncarries. Moreover, he caught two<br />\ntouchdown passes.<br />\n\"We came to play,\" said<br />\nMont. \"Any team can win on any<br />\ngiven day. It's just who wants it<br />\nmore.\"<br />\nThe defense, once again,<br />\ndelivered a stingy performance.<br />\nThe Jays sacked Muhlenberg's<br />\nquarterbacks five times, with two<br />\ncoming in the final minute of the<br />\ngame. Despite losing by three<br />\ntouchdowns, Muhlenberg moved<br />\nthe ball against Hopkins. The<br />\nMules had a first and goal on two<br />\nseparate drives, but could not<br />\nscore.<br />\n\"Our defense really played<br />\nwell again,\" said Margraff.\"We<br />\ngave up a couple of big plays, due<br />\nto blown coverages. We tried to<br />\nmake something happen and<br />\nMuhlenberg did a nice job in finding the open man.\"<br />\nThe Blue Jay defense looked<br />\nvery sharp on the opening drive.<br />\nAfter a half-back sweep and draw<br />\nplay were stifled by the Jays,<br />\nMuhlenberg's starting quarterback Mickey Rowe tried to<br />\nscramble for the first down. Stu<br />\nMarkley nearly decapitated the<br />\nquarterback, who was stopped a<br />\nyard short.<br />\nAfter a 26 yard punt, Hopkins<br />\nwent on a ten play drive that took<br />\nthem to Muhlenberg's 14 yard<br />\nline. Facing a third and eleven,<br />\nCade came under a heavy pass<br />\nrush and was intercepted by Mule<br />\nfree safety Clarke Paulus. The<br />\nJays offense returned immediately, after Brian Hepting intercepted Rowe on the very next<br />\nplay. From Muhlenberg's 24<br />\nyard line, the Jays needed four<br />\nplays before Cade found Mont on<br />\na screen pass that the fullback<br />\ntook 10 yards for the opening<br />\nscore. Trotta's kick made the<br />\nscore 7-0.<br />\nThe first quarter ended without<br />\na change in score, as the defense<br />\ncontinued to make an impression<br />\n(literally) on Muhlenberg.<br />\nMuhlenberg's offense made<br />\nsignificant gains in the second<br />\nquarter. However, their progress<br />\nwas continually retarded by the<br />\nBlue Jay pass rush. Frank<br />\nGangemi and Mark Labbe had<br />\nback to back sacks to quell<br />\nMuhlenberg's first drive in the<br />\nsecond quarter.<br />\nScott Cade, who finished the<br />\nday 16-25 for 182 yards, threw<br />\nhis third interception on the next<br />\n<br />\nseries, which gave Muhlenberg<br />\nthe ball inside the JHU 20.<br />\n\"The third interception was a<br />\nmisread,\" said Cade. \"I just<br />\ndidn't see the strong safety there.<br />\nOn the first two interceptions, I<br />\nwas trying to make something<br />\nhappen.\" Coach Mickey Rowe<br />\nquickly tied the game at 7 when<br />\nhe avoided the oncoming rush<br />\nand dashed into the endzone from<br />\n16 yards away.<br />\nThe Jays regained the lead with<br />\n35 seconds remaining in the half,<br />\nthanks to a juggling catch by<br />\nMont. The drive started four<br />\nminutes earlier with a series of<br />\nruns by Ferreri. The two week injury hiatus was not evident as<br />\nFerreri ran five times for 19 yards<br />\nin the drive. Mont's 16 yard run<br />\noff a draw gave Hopkins a first<br />\ndown from Muhlenberg's 43 yard<br />\nline. Cade began to warm up by<br />\ncompleting passes to Joe Richards<br />\nand Steve Lewis for a first down.<br />\nFrom the Mules' 32, Cade teamed up with Dave Cosenza on a<br />\nbeautiful timing pass down the<br />\nsidelines for a first and goal from<br />\nthe five. That set up Cade's two<br />\nyard toss to Mont, which was<br />\nthrown behind the receiver and<br />\nrequired Mont to spin around and<br />\ntip the ball in the air, before corralling it for the score. Marzio<br />\nTrotta missed the extra point, giving Hopkins a 13-7 lead at<br />\nhalftime.<br />\n\"Erik had an awesome game,\"<br />\nsaid Margraff. \"It was probably<br />\nthe best overall game from one of<br />\nour backs this year.

After collecting<br />\nthemselves in the second half,<br />\nHopkins tied the score on a ball<br />\nrun by junior Scott Haag. Haag<br />\npicked up a loose ball, put his<br />\nhead down, and headed for the<br />\ngoal line.

I<br />\nnever ran that fast in my life!\"<br />\nFrom that point on, the tide<br />\nturned in Hopkins' favor as they<br />\nrepeatedly drove into AU's territory.

Hopkins<br />\nthen consolidated itself and shut<br />\ndown the potent Mount offense.<br />\nShive's golden foot cut the lead<br />\nto 16-6. Five minutes before the<br />\nhalf, Hopkins displayed some<br />\nperfect rugby that advanced the<br />\nball the length of the field. The<br />\nplay ended on Joe McCullough's<br />\npass to Paul Kang, who took the<br />\nball in for the try. The score was<br />\n16-10 at the half.<br />\nIn the second. half, Shive tied<br />\nthe game with two penalty kicks<br />\n(he ended the day 4-6).

The game<br />\nwas a rout from the beginning as<br />\nHopkins thoroughly dominated<br />\nall facets of play.

Continuing the onslaught, Edwards took<br />\nthe ball on an eight-man keeper<br />\nand lunged in for his second try<br />\nof the season. Todd Fatsullo<br />\nmade an incredible conversion<br />\nkick from the far-right corner that<br />\ncurved beautifully through the<br />\nuprights to play as a desperate<br />\nFrostburg squad tried to come<br />\nfrom behind.

Thus, the women expected the game -to be a close<br />\nmatch-up, but they hoped they<br />\ncould finish the season with a big<br />\nwin. Instead they got close competition which proved to be too<br />\ntough to overcome.<br />\nHopkins stuck with the 2-4-4<br />\nformation (the use of two forwards, four halfbacks, and four<br />\nfullbacks for more support<br />\nthrough the middle) that they had<br />\nsuccessfully initiated against<br />\nMount Saint Mary's in the<br />\nprevious game, but that was not<br />\nenough to throw Loyola off, and<br />\nHopkins went into half time down<br />\nby 1. According to sophomore<br />\nJackie Fiehler, who was the goal<br />\nkeeper during the first half,<br />\n\"Loyola had a lot of really close<br />\nshots on goal,\" but Hopkins'<br />\ndefense played very well and was<br />\nable to block some very good<br />\nkicks. Fiehler went on to say,<br />\n\"Loyola and Hopkins are about<br />\nat the same level, so the game<br />\n<br />\nwas really good competition for<br />\nus.\"<br />\nHopkins made their comeback<br />\nin the second half when<br />\nsophomore Sarah Cushing scored<br />\nan unassisted goal. Coach Chuck<br />\nConnolly then decided to relieve<br />\nFiehler in the goal and put in<br />\nfreshman Sara Appleman. From<br />\nthen on both teams played extremely tough games so they were<br />\nable to prevent any further scoring, and that is the way the game<br />\nended.<br />\nOverall, the women on the<br />\nteam seem to feel that they played<br />\na very good game against Loyola,<br />\nand while a victory would have<br />\nbeen a great way to end the<br />\nseason, they played an excellent,<br />\nsolid game anyway. Fiehler even<br />\nsuggested that this game was one<br />\nof their best of the season.<br />\nMandy Weiss, a sophomore on<br />\nthe team said, \"We have gotten<br />\nmuch better; we've improved our<br />\npassing game and our teamwork<br />\nskills, it's just that they (Loyola)<br />\nhave really strong skills too.\"<br />\nWeiss noted, though, that she did<br />\nnot feel that Hopkins had as many<br />\nchances at scoring as Loyola had.<br />\nOverall, Loyola probably had<br />\nmore close shots on goal than<br />\nHopkins, but at least they were<br />\nnot able to convert them to points.<br />\nWeiss, as well as junior Heidi<br />\nContinued on page 17<br />\n<br />\neveryday throughout the year, he<br />\ncredits his performance to the<br />\nability of his instructor, Najib<br />\nAmin, and to a little luck, because<br />\nas he said, \"At this level of competition, minute factors make the<br />\ndifference.\" In reference to the<br />\nfirst of this season's East Coast<br />\nCollegiate Karate Union's tournaments, which will be held at<br />\nJHU on Saturday, October 27,<br />\nClark said that his performance<br />\nat Denver was no indication of<br />\nhow he will do again versus East<br />\nCoast Champions Ross Chasson<br />\nof Drexel University and Morris<br />\nKennedy of Temple University.<br />\nHe also noted that the young<br />\nHopkins team shows great promise for the coming season.

By recording their<br />\nseventh shutout of the season, the<br />\nBlue lays improved their record<br />\nto 8-3-2. The Jays beat Goucher<br />\nwith their most prolific offensive<br />\neffort of the season. On the way<br />\nto knocking out the starting<br />\nGopher goalie, the Jays spread<br />\nfive first half goals among four<br />\nplayers.<br />\nUnlike most of their past<br />\ngames, Hopkins took control of<br />\nthe ball early in the first half. Only five minutes into the contest,<br />\nHopkins opened the scoring when<br />\nsophomore forward Roxanne<br />\nTena knocked in a pass from<br />\nsenior co-captain Kathy Herring.<br />\nFive minutes later, from an<br />\nalmost identical spot, freshman<br />\nscoring sensation Beth Cariello<br />\npushed in a loose ball for her<br />\neighth goal of the season.<br />\nHopkins continued to score at<br />\nregular intervals throughout the<br />\nfirst half as they pounded the<br />\nGoucher goal. Sophomore Donna Williamson scored the Jays'<br />\nthird goal of the game and her<br />\nthird of the season midway<br />\nthrough the half. Tena recorded<br />\nher second goal of the game six<br />\nminutes later, giving her six for<br />\nthe season. Finally, with eight<br />\nminutes remaining in the half,<br />\nsenior Jen Chun closed out the<br />\nscoring as she whacked a rebound<br />\ninto an open goal. The goal was<br />\nher fburth of the season. That was<br />\nall the Goucher goalie could handle. During the next stoppage of<br />\nplay the lone Gopher reserve<br />\nreplaced the starting goalie.<br />\nAt the start of the second half,<br />\nHopkins coach Sally Beth Anderson wed similar strategy by<br />\n1,piacing four starters with<br />\nreserves. The largely freshman<br />\nsquad continued to pressure the<br />\nGopher goal but did allow<br />\n<br />\nGoucher two good scoring opportunities. Blue Jays's goalie Alec<br />\nKing was equal to the test. The<br />\nfirst Goucher chance was a high<br />\nshot from close in that King<br />\nknocked wide. During the closing minutes of the game Goucher<br />\nhad another chance as one of their<br />\nplayers broke through the Jays'<br />\ndefense. However, King made a<br />\nspectacular sliding save to<br />\npreserve the shutout.<br />\nSaturday, October 13\u2014<br />\nHopkins hosted undefeated<br />\nBloomsburg, the number one<br />\nteam in Division III Field<br />\nHockey. As could be expected,<br />\nthe Jays suffered their third loss<br />\nof the season as they were<br />\nshutout, 2-0, for the first time this<br />\nyear. According to Anderson, it<br />\n\"was the first time we've played<br />\nthem. They were really good.\"<br />\nWithout the services of senior<br />\ndefender Courtney DeVries or<br />\nsenior midfielder Meredith Blitz,<br />\nHopkins was forced to play<br />\ndefense for most of the game.<br />\nWhile King was busy making 13<br />\nsaves, the offense managed only<br />\n5 shots (only two of which were<br />\non goal). However, Anderson<br />\nwas satisfied with the \"good effort\" of her squad on their only<br />\npenalty corner of the game.<br />\n\"Beth ICariello] got the shot<br />\naway but it just missed,\" she<br />\nsaid.<br />\nAnderson was impressed by the<br />\ncaliber of Bloomsburg's play.<br />\n\"They played a very controlled<br />\ngame. They used the whole field<br />\nand had a great stick to stick passing.\" If there is a positive side in<br />\nlosing to a top ranked team,<br />\nAnderson sure found it. \"I like<br />\nto play a quality team like that to<br />\nlet us get better.\"<br />\nIn other notes, freshman<br />\ndefender Sonia Dickson returned<br />\nto full-time action after being<br />\nlimited by an injury.

Meanwhile, the Bucks<br />\nmight have the slowest frontcourt<br />\nin the history of the NBA. Coach<br />\nDel Harris finds a way to win<br />\ngames, however, and the Bucks<br />\n(behind guard Alvin Robertson)<br />\nwill be a thorn in many a contender's side.<br />\nAs the Bullets, Nets, and<br />\nHornets continue to flounder, the<br />\nMiami Heat should be greatly improved. Center Rony Seilkaly,<br />\nforward Glen Rice, and guard<br />\nSherman Douglas (along with<br />\nrookies Willie Burton and Alec<br />\nKessler) form a promising<br />\nnucleus.

Hopkins co-captain<br />\nGeoff Manning and leader of the<br />\nteam's defense commented on the<br />\nvictory, \"Swarthmore had a<br />\nlimited attack and our defense<br />\nreally played well.

With aieir<br />\nown offense failing, Washington<br />\nwas forced to try to play the ball<br />\nover the Hopkins defenders, a<br />\ntactic which proved just as<br />\nfruitless. In their way was the<br />\n6'6\" frame of stopper Geoff<br />\nManning, who dominated the<br />\ngame in the air. Also aiding Manning in the backfield were<br />\ndefensemen John Martinie, Nick<br />\nMartin, and Mike Vandekieft,<br />\nwho all played well under the<br />\npressure of the contest.<br />\nAs the game progressed,<br />\nHopkins was still attacking<br />\nconstantly.<br />\n\"Come on.

At stake for Hopkins<br />\nwas a possible shot at an NCAA<br />\nbid and a chance to gain the<br />\nrespect of soccer programs all<br />\nacross the country. Going into the<br />\ngame, Hopkins co-captain Warren Jones said simply, \"it's a<br />\ngrudge match. We lost to them<br />\n1-0 last year, and we don't want<br />\nthe same to happen.\"<br />\nThe Washington team was obviously not prepared for the<br />\nHopkins squad which played probably its best game of the season.<br />\nThis game was truly a pleasure<br />\nto watch, as teamwork, aggressive play, and constant<br />\npressure were exhibited for 120<br />\nminutes.<br />\nThe first half saw Hopkins<br />\nforce the pressure entirely. Mary<br />\nWashington players would.<br />\nreceive the ball and almost immediately have it stolen away by<br />\na Hopkins player. This sent a<br />\nclear message to the Washington<br />\nside as to what the Blue Jay's intentions were for the game. The<br />\nmidfielders especially were instrumental in not allowing the<br />\nWashington side to advance the<br />\nball past midfield. Once Hopkins<br />\nhad the ball, they were able to<br />\ndistribute it to all areas of the<br />\nfield. Leading the way for the<br />\nJays in this department was Omar<br />\nNicholson. Nicholson was involved throughout and used a deft<br />\ntouch to drive by Washington<br />\nplayers and pass the ball off.<br />\nSimilar to the Swarthmore<br />\ngame, while Hopkins did control<br />\nmuch of the play, they also had<br />\ntrouble converting a goal.

Meeting the attempted outlet pass at midfield<br />\nwas Nicholson, who played the<br />\nball ahead to streaking Jones.<br />\nCatching the Washington defense<br />\nby surprise, Jones found himself<br />\nalone and proceeded to take one<br />\ndribble and then blast a shot at the<br />\ngoal. His shot, however, sailed<br />\njust high of the net. On another<br />\nattempt, defender Nick Martin<br />\ncaught the ball off of a bounce<br />\nand shot for the corner, only to<br />\nhave the Washington goalkcpper<br />\ndive and catch the ball. These<br />\nnear misses were just two of the<br />\nchances Hopkins had. The teams<br />\nwere forced to go into overtime<br />\nin the scoreless game.<br />\nAll that was remaining were<br />\ntwo 15-minute overtime periods<br />\nin which both teams failed to<br />\nscore.

The reactions in<br />\nthe media and in both the<br />\nwhite and black communities,<br />\nto the recent Marion Barry<br />\ntrial and the the violent attacks<br />\nin Central Park, Howard<br />\nBeach, and Bensonhurst in New<br />\nYork demonstrate that both<br />\n<br />\nWhy should innocent<br />\nwhites pay the<br />\npenalty for<br />\ndiscrimination?<br />\nblacks and whites are becoming increasingly frustrated with<br />\nrecent trends in race relations.<br />\nBut why has opposition to<br />\naffirmative action in particular<br />\nbecome the principal means<br />\nfor whites to vent their unhappiness with race relations?<br />\nSimply put, these whites see<br />\nthe hypocrisy in legalizing a<br />\nsystem of discrimination so<br />\nshortly after the civil rights<br />\nmovement of the Sixties<br />\nsought to bring an end to judging a people by the color of<br />\ntheir skin. Calling affirmative<br />\naction a \"necessary evil\"<br />\nneeded for minorities to improve their standing only reinforces the idea that affirmative<br />\naction is, indeed, \"evil\" and<br />\nwrong.<br />\nConsequently, when they<br />\nhear of programs designed to<br />\nincrease minority representation, many whites see<br />\nthemselves as victims of<br />\nlegalized discrimination. They<br />\nmay wonder, for examale,<br />\n<br />\nwhy a white must be denied<br />\nadmission to a university in an<br />\nattempt to atone for past<br />\nwrongs. Why should he or she<br />\npay the penalty of discrimination? Why is he or she to<br />\nblame?<br />\nSeeing the success Duke enjoyed in playing off white<br />\nresentment over issues such as<br />\naffirmative action may lead<br />\nother politicians to start emphasizing racially-motivated<br />\nissues. Howell believes that<br />\n\"we will see candidates in<br />\nother places being more blunt<br />\nabout racial issues. 'Duke] is<br />\nthe strongest voice of white<br />\nbacklash that we have heard,<br />\nbut there will be more<br />\nvoices.\"<br />\nWhites therefore seem to be<br />\nlooking for outlets for their<br />\nfrustrations over such an impractical policy. They have no<br />\ndesire to see this legalized<br />\ndiscrimination continue. Thus,<br />\nthe rise of a politician like<br />\nDuke, who capitalized on<br />\nracial resentment, should not<br />\ncome as much of a surprise.<br />\nDavid Duke himself will<br />\nsoon run out of steam; his outwardly racist past will eventually overwhelm his crafty<br />\npolitical rhetoric.

A first option according to Cohen, is that of an<br />\nessentially peaceful policy\u2014<br />\n\"tightening the embargo and<br />\nwaiting for complicance on our<br />\nterms.\" This course would accomplish several important objectives, Cohen explained. First and<br />\nforemost, it would save lives. It<br />\nwould also \"maintain the coalition the President has remarkably<br />\nassembled,\" and of course, states<br />\nCohen, as long as the U.S. maintains peace, the U.S \"always has<br />\nthe war option.\"<br />\nThe coalition, he points out, is<br />\n\"quite unprecedented [and]<br />\ncreates the hope that we will curtail further Iraqi aggression. This<br />\nidea rests on the view that<br />\neconomic sanctions can work.\"<br />\nIraq's economic base will<br />\ndissolve once it is unable to sell<br />\noil, explained Cohen. This, in<br />\nturn, will \"force someone in Iraq<br />\nto deal with Sadaam and eventually, Kuwaiti government can<br />\nbe restored, and the \"damage can<br />\nbe undone.\"<br />\nAn alternative to this policy is<br />\nthe war option, according to<br />\nCohen. He points to the<br />\narguments of those in favor of<br />\nwar with Iraq. First, they claim,<br />\n\"Time is not on our side.\"<br />\nForces are operating in the Middle East beyond the control of the<br />\nU.S. The Egyptians and Saudis<br />\nsay the U.S. should go to war<br />\nnow, Cohen stated. \"If we wait,<br />\nwe will concede the initiative to<br />\nSadaam Hussein,\" Cohen<br />\nargued. Hussein may also use terror agianst the Arab states in the<br />\ncoalition, he said. Worst of all,<br />\naccording to Cohen, Sadaam<br />\n\"may offer us a deal that is too<br />\ngood to refuse,\" and which may<br />\nend up hurting the U.S. in the<br />\nlong run.<br />\nOther arguments used by those<br />\nin favor of war, according to<br />\nCohen, point to the fact that there<br />\ncan be \"no return to the status<br />\nquo [since] Kuwait is being<br />\nobliterated as a society.\" Further,<br />\n\"if Iraq survives, Israel is in<br />\ndanger. . .There will be instability in the Persain Gulf no matter<br />\nwhat. The only question is what<br />\nkind.\"<br /><br />\nCohen pointed out that in \"the<br />\nlong-run, Iraqi nuclear.. .potential is an enormous hazard,\u2014 and<br />\nhe questions what would happen<br />\nif this episode were to occur two<br />\nyears from now. Finally, Cohen<br />\nexplained, it is \"important to<br />\nestablish a precedent for effective<br />\nuse of force when confronted<br />\nwith this aggession.\"<br />\nAs Cohen views it, Bush has<br />\ntwo advantages in dealing with<br />\nthe crisis in the Gulf. \"He can<br />\nmake hard decisions and he can<br />\nkeep a secret.\" Unfortunately for<br />\nhim, Bush's \"inability to speak<br />\nto the heart of the American people\" reduces the overall effectiveness of the other two<br />\ncharacteristics.<br />\nIn conclusion, Cohen admitted<br />\nthat \"both strategies involve huge<br />\nrisks,\" and that to a certain<br />\ndegree, \"each stand excludes the<br />\nother.\" A policy of war, he said,<br />\nof course precludes peace, and a<br />\nstance of peace for too long of a<br />\ntime will eventually preclude<br />\naction.<br />\n\"This is a time to be grim,\"<br />\nadmonished Cohen. A feeling of<br />\n\"surrealism is caused by an<br />\nabsence of grimness in the<br />\nAmerican people.\" He emphasized that this issue cannot be treated<br />\nin a cavalier manner; it is \"no<br />\ntime to fantasize.\"<br />\n\"All in all,\" Cohen continued,<br />\n\"the alternatives will be stark\u2014<br />\neither for policy disaster or war<br />\nin the Persian Gulf, [disaster<br />\nmeaning] any situation in which<br />\nHussein makes any gains<br />\nwhatsoever.\"<br />\nCohen concluded by quoting<br />\nfrom Winston Churhill's My Early We:\"Never, never, never<br />\npresume any war will be easy.<br />\nOnce war begins, you no longer<br />\ncan control consequences. . .<br />\nThere would not be a war if the<br />\nother man did not also feel he had<br />\na reasonable chance of winning.\"<br /><br />\nToo much thyme on your<br />\nhands?

Ashby said that<br />\nAfrican-Americans and blacks<br />\nfrom other countries account for<br />\nabout seven percent of Hopkins<br />\nundergraduates. She also admitted that she knew of only three<br />\nfull-time professors at Hopkins,<br />\nall teaching in the School of Arts<br />\nand Sciences.<br />\n\"The one or two blacks<br />\nrepresented on the faculty is indicative of the fact that we have<br />\na problem and is justification<br />\nenough for the issue.

Although<br />\nHopkins is not the only college<br /><br />\ncampus to experience problems<br />\nwith race, Walters said,<br />\n\"Because we are citizens of this<br />\nuniversity, this is where we<br />\nshould focus our efforts.\"<br />\nAshby agreed, saying,<br />\n\"Hopkins is like a laboratory for<br />\nsocial change where we can learn<br />\nto relate to each other. The Symposium is one of the many events<br />\nthat can help Hopkins students<br />\naddress issues of racism now and<br />\nin the future.\"<br />\nFriedman and Veeraswamy<br />\nsubmitted their idea for the Symposium to the Student Council in<br />\nNovember of last year. As part<br />\nof their proposal, they compiled<br />\na potential list of speakers and<br />\ngoals for the program and outlined a possible budget. Both Friedman and Veeraswamy decided to<br />\nfocus on the media, politics, arts<br />\nand culture, and historical and<br />\ncontemporary perspectives to investigate how race is treated in<br />\nthese<br />\ndifferent<br />\nareas.<br />\nVeeraswamy said, however,<br />\n\"The lines are not so clearcut<br />\nnow.

I'm forjustice, no matter who excellent idea to get students to examine issues in more detail than<br />\nit is for or against. I'm a human being first and foremost, and as the Symposium alone would. This combination of elements makes<br />\nsuch I'm for whoever and whatever benefits humanity as a whole.\" \"Dreams Deferred\" the most ambitious Symposium in recent<br />\n\u2014Malcolm X memory.<br />\nThirty-five years after his death, Malcolm X is<br />\nviewed by many as a hate-monger, an anarchist whose primary goal<br />\nwas nothing less than the physical and spiritual polarization of the<br />\nUnited States. Indeed, Malcolm X spent a good part of his adult life<br />\nadvocating Black Nationalism. As a preacher for the Nation of Islam,<br />\nhe argued that racism was so deeply embedded in American society<br />\nthat the only way for African-Americans to achieve any kind of upward mobility was to construct their own society\u2014a world physically and culturally separate from the one which, as he saw it, was<br />\ndominated completely by whites. Further, he insisted that the \"victories\" of the Civil Rights Movement were nothing more than examples of \"token integration\" that would benefit only a handful of<br />\nAmerica's black population.<br />\nNow, thirty-five years after the deaths of both Malcolm X and Martin Luther King Jr., the quality of life for African-Americans remains<br />\nhazy. Although a greater number of blacks have permeated the middle class and the white-collar professions, suggesting a surge of upward mobility, racially motivated killings and attacks continue to make<br />\nheadlines across the country. The recent trial of Washington Mayor<br />\nMarion Barry hinted at a level of racial polarization in the capital<br />\nthat many Americans thought had vanished after the 1960s. Statutes<br />\nproviding for \"affirmative action\" in education and the workplace<br />\nseem now to hang in the balance as the Supreme Court questions<br />\nthe guiding principles behind them. All of this suggests that black<br />\nAmericans, like every other minority in the United States, are still<br />\nbeing forced to keep their eyes on the \"prize\" of racial equality:<br />\nthey can look, but they can't touch.<br />\nThis fact alone makes the 1990 Milton S. Eisenhower Symposium,<br />\n\"Dreams Deferred: Perspectives on Race Relations,\" a timely and<br />\nsignificant one. Composed of speakers as various as James Meredith<br />\n(who now works as an assistant to Senator Jesse Helms), author Taylor<br />\nBranch, and filmmaker Spike Lee, the program virtually guarantees<br />\na broad sampling of perspectives on what is still referred to as \"the<br />\nmovement.\" Such diverse outlooks guarantee, too, that conflicting views about race in the United States\u2014what the situation is, whom<br />\nit is affecting, and how it might change in the future\u2014will clash on<br />\nthe stage in Shriver Hall. Although Lee and Merideth are almost certain to generate controversy, perhaps the most explosive event of<br />\nthe Symposium will be a panel discussion on \"The Politics of Race,\"<br />\nwhich will bring former Dukakis campaign manager Susan Estrich<br />\nonto the same stage with Ed Rollins, chairman of the National<br />\nRepublican Congressional Committee, along with two other intelligent<br />\nobservers of America's racial zeitgeist.<br />\nThis year's Symposium Chairs, Mark Friedman and Ravi<br />\nVeeraswamy, have assembled an impressive roster of speakers. Better<br />\nstill, the two put together a companion course and film series\u2014an<br /><br />\nWhen considering the scope of the Symposium's chosen field,<br />\nhowever, the News-Letter has some reservations about \"Dreams<br />\nDeferred.\" First among these is the question \"Whose Symposium<br />\nis it anyway?\" If it is for the benefit of the Hopkins community\u2014<br />\nstudents, faculty, and staff\u2014then it is too exclusive. Over a quarter<br />\nof Hopkins' students are Asian-Americans; blacks constitute a far<br />\nsmaller slice of the student population. Although this last fact attests<br />\nto the importance of a Symposium about African-American issues,<br />\nit also suggests that the Symposium Chairs might have concentrated<br />\non Asian-American issues entirely, or at least secured more than one<br />\nspeaker to address the subject. As it stands, Bill Wong's November<br />\n29th speech on \"Asian-Americans: Silent, or the Model Minority?\"<br />\nseems tacked onto the Symposium schedule, a break in the program's.<br />\ncontinuity and a bone tossed to an unusually neglected minority. A<br />\nSymposium about the differences between Asian-American cultures<br />\nwould be an excellent idea for next year's program.<br />\nThe News-Letter's second reservation is more a warning than a<br />\ncomplaint. Although the Symposium will parade before you a group<br />\nof formidable intellects who will speak cogently and knowledgably<br />\non their subjects, don't expect the world of them nor of the Symposium. As last year's \"Education on the Edge\" demonstrated, every<br />\nspeaker comes with his or her own agenda, and those agendas don't<br />\nalways relate to the Symposium topic, or even to the titles of their<br />\nspeeches. Some may want to plug books, or sell you on their political<br />\nparty; others may try to rip apart the Reagan or Kennedy administrations. The important thing to realize is that these folks aren't likely<br />\nto simplify the complexities of race. If they do their job, they will<br />\nmultiply them\u2014which is fine, as long as one realizes that there is<br />\nalways more to the picture than these people may suggest.<br />\nAlthough it is painfully complicated, race is also one of the most<br />\npertinent issues in American history and in America present. There's<br />\nmuch to be gained by learning about the Malcolm X's background,<br />\nfor example, or finding out who Vernon Johns and Frederick Douglass<br />\nwere. Just as profitable is reading through Martin Luther King's soaring speeches\u2014or better, hearing recordings of them\u2014and investigating<br />\nRosa Parks's real role in the Montgomery Bus Boycott. There's plenty<br />\nof material, all of it fascinating, and all of it relevent.<br />\nBut while you're sitting there in Shriver,just for kicks, try to count<br />\nthe number of administrators you see\u2014they're usually easy to spot.<br />\nThen, after the talk is over, go up to one and ask what the University is doing about hiring minorities and women. If you don't see any<br />\nadministrators at the Symposium lectures, write a letter to President<br />\nRichardson, or to Deans Armstrong or VandeLinde. Ask them the<br />\nsame question. But do ask them: it would be a shame if the insights<br />\nof the Symposium were lost on those who seem to need them most.<br /><br />\nLetters<br />\nThe Miranda Act<br />\nDouglass Barre<br />\nEpisode Five:<br />\nHouse Meeting Head On<br />\nWhen the time for the house<br />\nmeeting came around, Miranda<br />\nwas the only one there. Actually, that wasn't true. Zack was<br />\nthere, asleep on the couch.<br />\nZack had his own apartment,<br />\nMiranda was certain, but weeks<br />\nlike this past one, something in<br />\nthe back of her head caused her<br />\nto doubt its existence. Zack had<br />\nshown up Monday night for their<br />\nweekly Monday night study break<br />\nwatching television, and she<br />\ndidn't think he had been out of<br />\nher sight for more than an hour<br />\nsince then. And it was Thursday<br />\nnight.<br />\nShe smiled fondly at him,<br />\nsleeping, and said, \"Get a life,<br />\nZack.\"<br />\nHe gurgled something in his<br />\nsleep that sounded remarkably<br />\nlike \"touch the puppet head\" and<br />\nrolled over (or at least as much<br />\nas he could roll over on the living room couch.).<br />\nDoris poked her head in from<br />\nthe kitchen. \"I'll be at the<br />\nmeeting in a minute, Miranda,\"<br />\nshe beamed. Doris always<br />\nbeamed. It only heightened<br />\nMiranda's anticipation of the<br />\nweekly house meeting. If there<br />\nwas one thing Miranda liked<br />\nabout living with Carol and Doris<br />\nit was telling Carol and Doris<br />\nhow hard it was to live with them.<br />\nThis week, Miranda really had<br />\na lot of aggression to get out, too.<br />\nShe looked at the tablet in her lap:<br />\n\"I . Dishes. 2. Phone Bill. 3.<br />\nThat eyesore in the front hall.\"<br />\nOver the span of a week, Miranda had noted down at least twelve<br />\nthings about her roommates to<br />\nbitch about, but she knew that, in<br />\nher heart, there was only one<br />\nreason she was so anxious about<br />\nit: David.<br />\nHer boyfriend, who she only<br />\ngot to see for three months out of<br />\nthe year, had joined the army\u2014<br />\nG.I. Bill, so he could affford -to<br />\ngo to school. At this rate, they<br />\nwouldn't be in the same place for<br />\nthe next five years. Where was<br /><br />\nthe quality time she was promised after graduation? Miranda<br />\nsimply refused to be an army<br />\nwife.<br />\n\"Really! Just one minute!\"<br />\nDoris shouted from the kitchen.<br />\n\"The cookies are almost ready!\"<br />\n\"No rush, Doris,\" Miranda<br />\nsaid resignedly. \"The prodigal<br />\nroommate isn't back yet.\"<br />\nThe front door opened. \"I'm<br />\nback!\" Carol cried.<br />\n\"I would never have guessed,\"<br />\nMiranda muttered.<br />\n\"Great. I've got some cookies<br />\nhere, Carol.\"<br />\nDoris walked in the room with<br />\na cookie tray covered with<br /><br />\nDoris walked into<br />\nthe room with a cookie<br />\ntray covered with<br />\ncharred lumps<br /><br />\ncharred lumps that appeared to<br />\ncontain oatmeal.<br />\n\"Pass,\" Miranda said.<br />\nCarol walked in and sat on the<br />\nseat opposite the couch. \"So are<br />\nwe starting?\" she asked<br />\nimpatiently.<br />\nMiranda repressed the urge to<br />\nimpale her on Doris' spatula.<br />\n\"Yes, let's do.\"<br />\nDoris plopped herself into one<br />\nof the dining table chairs.<br />\n\"Cookies, anyone'?\"<br />\n\"Pass,\" Miranda repeated,<br />\nhoping that Doris wouldn't recall<br />\nthat she hadn't eaten anything<br />\nDoris had cooked in months.<br />\n\"No, I'm full. Dennis and the<br />\ncrew cooked up shish kabob at<br />\ntheir apartment and I ate there.\"<br />\n\"First,\" Miranda started, \"the<br />\nphone bill came. Doris and I both<br />\nmarked off our calls, if you'd go<br />\nthrough it and do the same'?\" She<br />\nhanded Carol the bill. Carol felt<br />\nher pockets for a pencil and upon<br />\nnot finding one, opened up<br />\nContinued on page 18<br /><br />\nThe ROTC Debate Marches onand on and on.. .<br />\nTo the Editors:<br />\nThis letter is addressed to all of<br />\nyou out there who are taking the<br />\nROTC's side in the current campus<br />\ndebate about whether or not to allow<br />\nthe Corps to remain at Hopkins.<br />\nWhat you are doing, plain and simple, is saying that it is all right to<br />\ndiscriminate against gay and lesbian<br />\npeople. You try to hide behind seemingly safe rationalizations such as<br />\n\"Oh, the Corps itself doesn't determine the policy prohibiting gays and<br />\nlesbians from enrolling, so don't<br />\npick on them;\" or, \"ROTC's<br />\npresence on campus benefits<br />\neveryone,\" etc., but none .of these<br />\never holds up to serious analysis.<br />\nTrue, the ROTC doesn't make armed forces policy about admitting gays<br />\nand lesbians, but, it does zealously<br />\nenforce that policy. And, does<br />\nROTC's existence at Hopkins really benefit the campus as a whole?<br />\nThere are less than 100 people in the<br />\nprogram; that means that 2800<br />\naren't.<br />\nMore importantly than this,<br />\nhowever, you are endorsing<br />\nhomophobia. You are saying that it<br />\nis OK to treat gays and lesbians in<br />\na different, negative way. In so doing, you forget one very simple, selfevident fact: no one who is gay, lesbian, bisexual, or straight (and one<br />\nof these most likely includes you)<br />\nchose to be that way; it just happened, as did that person's skin or eye<br />\ncolor. To treat someone differently<br /><br />\nbecause of something beyond his or<br />\nher control is immoral, not to mention ignorant.

In Paul's attempt to make a<br />\ngeneralization about the military, he<br />\nincorrectly assumes I am a member<br />\nof this force. If I were a cadet,<br /><br />\nperhaps I would identify myself as<br />\none, as Mr. Bateman did.

In this game, the<br />\nneeds of the many outweigh the<br />\nneeds of the few.

But don't be<br />\nfooled by its title. This film is not<br />\nabout Roxy Carmichael or the<br />\nCenter for Cosmetology and<br />\nDrama she is opening up in her<br />\nhometown of Clyde, Ohio.<br />\nRather, this is the story of how<br />\nthat homecoming affects the<br />\nsleepy little town, and specifically<br />\none person, Dinky Bosetti<br />\n(Winona Ryder).<br />\nDinky is the mixed-up adopted<br />\n\"kid eccentric\" of the town. She<br />\nalways dresses in black, talks to<br />\nanimals, has chains and bolts on<br />\nher bedroom door(but leaves her<br />\nwindow open), and is generally<br />\nconsidered to be a bit weird by<br />\nmost everyone. To say that Dinky<br />\nis somewhat unhappy with her<br />\nlife is like saying Russia is \"kinda big.\" Dinky hates her mother,<br />\nfeels estranged from her father,<br />\nand is scorned by almost<br />\neveryone in school. Her parents<br />\nwant to send her to a school for<br />\n\"socially<br />\ndysfunctional\"<br />\nstudents.<br />\nDinky has other ideas. After<br /><br />\ntalking with Denton Webb (Jeff<br />\nDaniels), Roxy's former<br />\nboyfriend, about the baby they<br />\ngave up for adoption, Dinky<br />\nbecomes obsessed with the idea<br />\nthat she is the child of Denton and<br />\nRoxy. She concocts a plan to<br />\nescape Clyde by petitioning Roxy<br />\nto take her away from all this. To<br /><br />\nHollywood where we see silent<br />\nscenes of Roxy swimming, packing to leave for Clyde, riding to<br />\nthe airport.<br />\nThe movie moves toward its<br />\nfocal point, the gala Roxy Ball to<br />\nbe held at the Cosmetology and<br />\nDrama Center that Friday evening. Dinky gets herself in and out<br /><br />\nDinky is the mixed-up kid<br />\neccentric who dressed in black,<br />\ntalks to animals, has chains and<br />\nbolts on her bedroom door, and is<br />\ngenerally considered to be a bit<br />\nweird by almost everyone.<br />\nthis end she starts imitating<br />\nRoxy's habits. She develops a<br />\npenchant for pink (just like Roxy)<br />\nand goes as far as stealing Roxy's<br />\nshoelaces from the shrine/<br />\nmuseum the town has made out<br />\nof Roxy's old house.<br />\nWhile all this is going on in<br />\nClyde, every so often we cut to<br /><br />\nof trouble wandering about Clyde<br />\ncaught up in the idea that Roxy<br />\ncould be her mother. During the<br />\ncourse of the week Gerry<br />\nHowells(T. Wilson Brown), the<br />\nmost popular boy in school,<br />\nbegins to fall in love with her.<br />\nAs Dinky runs about mooning<br />\nover Roxy, Gerry runs about<br /><br />\nmooning over Dinky. The rest of<br />\nthy town should be so happy. All<br />\nthe town women are in an uproar<br />\ntrying to compete. One woman,<br />\nEvelyn, who was always jealous<br />\nof Roxy, decides to get her hair<br />\ncolored to look like Roxy's with,<br />\nah, interesting results.<br />\nThe performances in Roxy Carmichael are good enough to make<br />\nthis fanciful story work. Winona<br />\nRyder is perfect as the awfullyweird Dinky, and Graham Beckel<br />\ntruly becomes Dinky's tender,<br />\nconfused, and dominated father.<br />\nT. Wilson Brown's performance<br />\nas Gerry begins weakly, but<br />\nmanages to pull itself up by the<br />\nfilm's end. The acting done by<br />\nFrances Fisher, as Dinky's mom,<br />\nhowever, is unforgivable; it is<br />\nboth shallow and false.<br />\nBut the film as a whole is truly<br />\nhilarious and very touching. As<br />\nthe audience watches the<br />\ntownspeople dance about in confusion, slaves to devotion of their<br />\nlocal god, they learn much about<br />\nthemselves. All their dreams and<br />\ndesires hinge upon Roxy's<br />\nhomecoming. Does Dinky get a<br />\nmother? Will Roxy even notice<br />\nDenton, who is ruining his mar-<br /><br />\n(1.1)1.

While these annual<br />\ntwenty- to thirty-minute plays<br />\nusually don't contain enough<br />\nmeat to qualify as High Art, their<br />\nsharp humor and wry selfawareness make them among the<br />\nmost endearing of Barnstormers<br />\nproductions.

The<br />\nplay is ostensibly about a family's car trip to visit a bereaved<br />\ndaughter, although the ubiquitous<br /><br />\npresence of the stage manager<br />\n(Bob Mertz) gives the entire show<br />\na metaphysical twist.<br />\nThe star of the script is<br />\nMichelle Conroy, playing the<br />\nopinonated yet nurturing mother.<br />\nConroy seems very comfortable<br />\nonstage and delivers her lines<br />\nwith a subtle faith and tenderness.<br />\nAlso notable is Jason Sullivan in<br />\nthe role of her son Arthur; he<br />\nshows great promise in his corn-<br /><br />\nic delivery of the not-so-prodigal<br />\nson.

You watch these performers smiling and sweating<br />\nduring the encores and there is no<br />\nquestion in your mind that they<br />\nhave worked hard.<br />\nThe Randy Warshaw Dance<br />\nCompany made its Baltimore<br />\ndebut this past weekend as the<br />\nfirst performance in the \"Dance<br />\non the Edge\" series, taking place<br />\nat the Baltimore Museum of Art.<br />\nWarshaw has been pointed out as<br />\none of the rising stars of the contemporary dance scene, and his<br />\ncompany of dancers is worthy of<br />\nsimilar acclaim for its energetic<br />\nperformance of two very different<br />\nworks.<br />\nTheir performance was visually<br />\nand acoustically stunning. In<br />\n\"Event Horizon,\" the first of two<br />\npieces performed, the set of six<br />\ndancers move in vibrant, quicklychanging patterns of alternation.<br />\nIn moments, there is a slow shif-<br /><br />\nting of balance and weight, then<br />\na passionate turn and an athletic<br />\nleap, which lands to become an<br />\nethereal slide. A fast, rigid figure<br />\nsuddenly becomes limp, losing<br />\nstrength and sagging slowly<br />\nbeneath the force of gravity. Interaction between dancers<br />\nchanges rapidly as well. They<br />\nwill move freely and independently, only to jump and<br />\nsnap into the arms of another<br />\npassing dancer. On occasion, one<br />\ndancer becomes the moulder of<br />\nanother, forming motions in the<br />\nother with their hands. There is<br />\na sense of organic interlocking<br />\nbetween the dancers, of spontaneity and complementarity. The<br />\nmusical background is an electronic psycho-funk score which<br />\nalternates pulsing jazz and funk<br />\nrhythms with nostalgic violin<br />\nphrases, frequently interrupted by<br />\nthe metallic rattling of drums and<br />\nwhat sound like power tools. In<br />\nperformance, the lighting is able<br />\nto work subtle emotional effects,<br />\nshifting hues as the feeling of the<br />\ndance changes. During the lyrical<br />\nviolins, the dancers move with<br />\nthe stately rigidity of wind-blown<br />\ntrees, and the stage is bathed in<br /><br />\nDancers in tile Randy Warshaw Company experiment with<br />\ninterlocking forms in a gymnastic performance.<br /><br />\nblue. Conflict erupts with the<br />\ndancers pushing and pulling, the<br />\ninstruments scream, and lights<br />\nglare orange. By the end of the<br />\npiece, you are left exhausted and<br />\nawake.<br />\nThe second piece performed<br />\nwas \"Fragile Anchor,\" whose<br />\nmood and movement replace<br />\n\"Event Horizon's\" conflict with<br />\na grand, living quality. The<br />\ndancers enter in flowing,<br />\ngossamer clothes, turning serenely about the stage in delicately<br />\nsynchronized movements. There<br />\nis free and constant motion. Arms<br />\noutstretched, they twirl, leap,<br />\nsweep their hands slowly along<br />\nthe ground. For several large portions of the piece, one performer<br />\ndances alone in a vibrant isolation, or two dancers engage in<br />\ngently interlocking pas de deux.<br />\nIn contrast to the music of the jar-<br /><br />\nring, violent \"Event Horizon,\"<br />\nthe soundtrack is the rich and<br />\njoyful Quartet for Strings and<br />\nMarimba, calling forth a kind of<br />\nquiet order. At one point, the<br />\nmusic turns toward the Middle<br />\nEastern themes, and the<br />\nmovements evoke the stiff<br />\nelegance of an ancient Egyptian<br />\npainting. In others, the eerie<br />\nplucking of a guitar may accompany dancers struggling in slowmotion, beneath a deep, undersea<br />\nblue. The piece ends with more<br />\nfree-flowing contact, with<br />\ndancers rolling into handstands,<br />\nflipping and turning over each<br />\nother's backs.<br />\nViewing modern dance, or indeed any kind of dance outside of<br />\na HOP event, is likely to be a<br />\nrelatively challenging experience.<br />\nIt's because dance is a form of art<br />\nthat accesses our oldest and most<br /><br />\npersonal symbol in its expression:<br />\nour bodies. It's a symbol that<br />\nwe're not used to reading, and<br />\nyou may be able to say, as I can,<br />\nthat you honestly did not understand anything Randy Warshaw<br />\nmeant to say by choreographing<br />\nthese excellent pieces. But you<br />\nmay feel something, and maybe<br />\nyou'll be left exhilarated without<br /><br />\nknowing exactly why.<br />\nThe \"Dance on the Edge\"<br />\nseries continues November 16-18<br />\nwith Maureen Fleming's performance of\"Water on the Moon,\"<br />\nan eerie and elegant minimalist<br />\nwork inspired by Japanese butoh,<br />\nthe aesthetic of precisely controlled movements. It promises to<br />\nstartle and haunt, so look into it.<br /><br />\nYoung Talent Polished and Perfected<br />\nIn Legendary Freshman One Acts<br />\nContinued from page 9<br />\nplaywright Jack Barnstable (Tim<br />\nWoodard) engages the audience<br />\nin a debate on nudity in the<br />\ntheater. The plot takes a sharp<br />\nturn to the ridiculous when a<br />\ndopey, out-of-work actor (Todd<br />\nRooney) attempts to secure the<br />\nnude part, no matter what risk to<br />\nhis personal pride. In the, end,<br />\nBarnstable's goal has been accomplished without any actual<br />\nnudity on the stage, and we see<br />\nman in all his foolishness and<br />\nincompetence.<br />\nAs Barnstable, Tim Woodard<br />\ngives an extremely polished performance as Artist Without Compromise. Sarah Gershman also<br />\ndelivers her part as the nasal<br />\nsecretary with hilarious accuracy.<br />\nTodd Rooney, however, as the<br />\nbumbling stripper/actor, provides<br />\nthe sparLwhich ignites the play.<br />\nOnly Colin Chellrnan's reluctant<br />\nproducer seems a little wooden;<br />\nhe gets most Of thtlaiighs at the<br /><br />\noutset of the play but uses his<br />\ndesk as more of a shelter than a<br />\nprop.<br />\nAfter a brief intermission, the<br />\nfreshmen returned with Dickie<br />\nMarke Jr.'s \"La Venue D'Arthur.\" Although \"D'Arthur\" had<br />\nits share of laughs, the script was<br />\nmore suited for television than the<br />\nstage. The plot was typical John<br />\nHughes material: geeky nerds and<br />\nplain girls pitted against football<br />\nstuds and makeup queens.<br />\nMarke, Jr. has a good ear for<br />\ncomic dialogue and obviously put<br />\na lot of thought into the Arthurian<br />\nsymbolism, but he ends up covering no new ground.<br />\nLuckily, the cast of the play is<br />\na talented one. Arthur and Meg<br />\n(Eric Jeffries and Carla Berg), the<br />\nmain couple, are both likeable<br />\nand fairly uninhibited in their acting, as is Jennifer (AnnMarie<br />\nDeFiglio).

This<br />\nyear he ran for the Maryland<br />\nHouse of Delegates.<br />\nAlthough Henry did not win a<br />\nseat in the legislature, the<br />\nHopkins senior learned a great<br />\ndeal from the experience and<br />\nplans to run for political office<br />\nagain.<br />\n\"I had not expected to be running alone against the incumbents,\" said Henry. Instead,<br />\nhe ran against the district's three<br />\nincumbents, who ran as a ticket<br />\nalong with the district's State<br />\nSenator and five other candidates.<br /><br />\nAccording to Henry, during the<br />\nbeginning of the campaign, the<br />\nticket just ignored him. Then,<br />\nafter he received some publicity<br />\nfrom the Baltimore Sun, the other<br />\ncandidates were forced to pay attention. Then, \"they outspent<br />\nme. Badly.\"<br />\nBut Henry believes that the<br />\ncampaign was worthwhile for the<br />\nname recognition and experience<br />\nhe gained. He was also very encouraged by the amount of support he had from other students.<br />\n\"One night, the members of<br />\nthe ticket and I were campaigning in the same area. They had<br />\nmore people total, but I had five<br />\nor six people campaigning with<br /><br />\nme, whereas each of the other<br />\ncandidates had only brought one<br />\nother person.\"<br />\nAs for what made him decide<br />\nto run in the first place. Henry<br />\nlists two reasons. First, his career<br />\nobjective is government service,<br />\n\"preferably elected office.\"<br />\nSecondly, he chose to run for<br />\nthe House of Delegates this year<br />\nbecause \"it was the first office I<br />\nwas old enough to run for.\"<br />\nHe wants to run for the<br />\nBaltimore, City Council, but he<br />\nwill not announce his candidacy<br />\nofficially until redistricting is<br />\ncompleted in February of next<br />\nyear.<br />\nHenry intends to start his cam<br /><br />\npaign earlier next year. He also<br />\nplans to talk to more people as<br />\nwell as making sure that they<br />\nhave \"something with his name<br />\non it in their hands on election<br />\nday.\"<br />\nHenry would also like to run on<br />\na ticket with other candidates the<br />\nnext time. He plans to concentrate<br />\non education, a city recycling<br />\npolicy, and crime, among other<br />\nissues.<br />\nHenry said he also learned two<br />\nvery important things which he<br />\nwill apply to his 1991 campaign.<br />\nFirst, he said with a smile, he will<br />\nbuy shoes with arch supports.

For those who wanted<br />\ngames but did not feel like<br />\ncreating characters, there were<br />\nothers such as Wizards and<br />\nCosmic Encounter. And, of<br />\ncourse, there were the oldfashioned board games of chess<br />\nand Monopoly, as well as<br />\nnumerous card games.<br />\nWhy all the excitement over<br />\nsome games? Well, this is one of<br />\nHopSFA's major fundraisers of<br />\nthe year, and it is always lots of<br />\nfun. Last year was the first<br />\nFallmeet, and its success has<br />\nmade it a new tradition.

According to the City Paper, this is<br />\n\"The Most Elitist Restaurant\" in<br />\nBaltimore, as well as having the<br />\nbest wine list and the best dinner<br />\nfor over $75 in the Best of<br />\nBaltimore edition.<br />\nThis is all very evident as soon<br />\nas you walk in. The theme of the<br />\ndecor is hunting, and the dominant color is green. The only flaw<br />\nI call see with the design is that<br />\nin order to get to your table, you<br />\nmust go through the bar area.<br />\nOtherwise, the atmosphere would<br />\nbe four stars.<br />\nFor an appetizer, I recommend<br />\nWoodland<br />\nthe American<br />\nMushroom Tartlette ($5.95).<br />\nThis stuffed mushroom cap is<br />\nwonderful. They also have as an<br />\nappetizer Jumbo Gulf Shrimp<br />\n($7.50). I also recommend this,<br />\nas it is equally good.<br />\nFor entrees, the menu offers a<br />\nvariety of selections. I strongly<br />\nrecommend the Penne Pasta<br />\n($13.95), which consists of pasta<br />\nwith red peppers, tomatoes and<br />\nlentils. It is excellent. Also good<br />\nis the Poached Salmon ($29.50),<br />\nas well as Panos &amp; Paul's<br />\nFamous Fried Lobster Tail<br />\n($36.00). After speaking to a few<br />\nnative Marylanders, the .only<br />\nseafood that was not recommended to me was the Crab Cake Platter ($29.50).<br />\nAfter dinner, there are several<br />\ndesserts worth trying. They range<br />\nin price from reasonable to expensive, including Bavarian<br />\nCream Pie, Flourless Chocolate<br />\nCake, and Strawberry Shortcake.<br />\nOverall, I liked the Polo Grill.<br />\nThe servers were never out of<br />\narm's reach, the entrees were<br />\nbrought promptly, and I didn't<br /><br />\ntel rushed. The drawbacks to the<br />\nPolo Grill are that it's expensive<br />\nand that you need reservations. If<br />\nyou want to try the Polo Grill and<br />\ndon't have unlimited funds, two<br />\npeople can get a good lunch for<br />\naround twenty dollars.

That night the<br />\nchoir was proud to be in the company of Gospel greats such as the<br />\nHawkins Family and the Clark<br />\nSisters. As a result of that spectacular night several of the singers<br />\nin the choir have been asked to<br />\naudition for the musical's future<br />\nperformances.<br />\nKevin Rodgers smiles sincerely<br />\nand enthusiastically when he talks<br />\nabout the Gospel Choir. He has<br />\nbeen the director of the choir for<br />\nthe past two years and he has watched it gain increasing recognition within the Baltimore<br />\ncommunity.<br />\nThe most unique feature of the<br />\nchoir is its sincere attempt at<br />\nuniting Johns Hopkins students<br />\nwith the rest of the Baltimore<br /><br />\ncommunity. But Rodgers also<br />\nemphasizes that aside from bringing unity to the community, he<br />\nalso hopes to spread a deeper<br />\nsense of goodwill within the<br />\nworld.

Erik Mont's<br />\nthree touchdowns catapulted<br />\nHopkins to a 28-7 romp over the<br />\nMuhlenberg Mules. The win improved the Blue Jays' record to<br />\n3-3 overall and 2-2 in the<br />\nconference.<br />\n\"We go as our defense goes,\"<br />\nsaid Head Coach Jim Margraff.<br />\n\"We were a very good football<br />\nteam defensively for four<br />\nquarters. Offensively, we hurt<br />\nourselves early, but once we<br />\neliminated the turnovers, we took<br />\ncontrol of the game and did a very<br />\nnice job.\"<br />\nThe offense played its most<br /><br />\nLacrosse Loses Classic to Tigers<br />\nScrimmage Used to Heal Injured, Evaluate New Players<br />\nby Jay Friedman<br />\nAlthough the men's lacrosse<br />\nteam entered the CHOICE Visa<br />\nLacrosse classic last weekend<br />\nhoping to win, head coach Tony<br />\nSeaman was content to use the<br />\ntournament for what it really<br />\nis\u2014 exhibition. The Blue Jays<br />\nsuffered a 12-7 loss at the hands<br />\nof the Towson State Tigers.<br />\nHowever, Seaman was not<br />\nbroken up over his first loss as<br />\nHopkins coach. \"We definitely<br />\nwanted to play Sunday [in the<br />\nchampionship game against<br />\nLoyola] but my intent was to use<br />\nthis as an opportunity to evaluate<br />\nour program. This was a scrimmage. I used it as a chance to<br />\nevaluate new players and heal the<br />\ninjured ones.\"<br />\nMake no mistake, the injured<br />\nplayers could have had a significant impact on the outcome of the<br />\ngame. However, they were never<br />\nexpected to play in the Classic<br />\nand the coaching staff had no<br />\ndesire to use injuries as an excuse<br />\nfor the lackluster performance.<br />\n\"Of course we weren't as successful as we wanted to be. We<br />\ncould have given the ball to all the<br />\nright people and come out with<br />\na one goal win, but then we<br />\nwouldn't know what to work on.<br />\nWe weren't going to change our<br />\nphilosophy for a pre-season<br />\ngame,\" Seaman said. That<br />\nphilosophy is what allowed over<br />\nthirty players to see action.<br />\nHopkins entered the Classic<br />\nagainst a hungry Tiger team.<br />\nTSU coach Carl Runk was disappointed the Tigers did not earn a<br />\ntournament bid after last season's<br />\n11-2 record (losing only to<br />\nLoyola and Hopkins), \"but that's<br />\nnot the focus this year,\" he said.<br />\nThe Tigers return their top nine<br />\nscorers of a year ago. Scoring<br />\nsensation Glenn Smith anchored<br />\na seasoned attack unit that has<br />\nbeen playing together for three<br />\nyears. Even their second string<br />\nattack is solid. The first line<br />\nreturns intact led by senior AllAmerican Rob Shek who scored<br />\nthirty goals last season. While the<br />\nteam lost All-Conference players<br />\nin goalie David\u2022 Linthicum and<br />\ndefenseman Ben Keesey,they obtained an All-American in junior<br />\ncollege transfer goalie Richard<br />\nBetcher.<br />\nTrue to form, the TSU offense<br />\nexcelled and Betcher was solid in<br />\ngoal. Smith scored the game<br />\nopener less than two minutes after<br />\nthe start of the game and added<br />\ntwo more in the third quarter.<br />\nShek added two more as did<br />\nMichael DeSimone. Betcher<br />\nmade several sparkling one-onone saves in holding the Jays to<br />\nonly seven goals.<br />\nFortunately there were several<br />\nbright spots for Hopkins.<br />\nAlthough not readily apparent by<br />\nthe score, the close defense<br />\nplayed a steady game led by<br />\njunior goalie Scott Giardina.<br />\nSeaman was understandably happy about the defensive play. \"I<br />\nthink one thing we proved is we<br />\nhave a quality Division I goalie<br /><br />\nwho can play this game for<br />\nanyone,\" he said. \"I think the<br />\none place we got hurt was in transition. We played a good settled<br />\ndefense.\" Indeed, the team<br />\nallowed four transition goals,<br />\nthree man-down goals (an area<br />\nwhich has not been practiced<br />\nmuch yet) and one in the closing<br />\nminute of the game. Considering<br />\nthe variety of defenses played<br />\n(five), the number of different<br />\nplayers (and units) utilized, and<br />\nthe number of goals allowed in<br />\nsettled situations (four, of which<br />\ntwo were screens), the close<br />\ndefense and goalie positions appear strong.<br />\nOne area Seaman thought<br />\nneeds work is on attack. \"Our<br />\nonly breakdown was our inabilityit h4ndle the ball offensively,\"<br />\nhe said. The dropped passes,<br />\noverthrown balls and elusive<br />\nground balls were costly for<br />\nHopkins as they allowed the<br />\nTigers several unsettled goals in<br />\nthese situations. However,junior<br />\nattackman Jeff Wills managed the<br />\nJays' two first half goals and<br />\nassisted on three others. Also<br />\nfiguring in the scoring for<br />\nHopkins were Brian Tobin,<br />\nCharlie Speno, Adam Wright,<br />\nDrew Burns, and David Town-<br /><br />\nsend who each scored once and<br />\nTodd Cavallaro who contributed<br />\non assist.<br />\nIn a clear indication cif the<br />\n\"Seaman Era,\" the team played<br />\nseveral defensive schemes(mostly versions of a zone), a fast<br />\nbreak offense (that had its<br />\ntroubles handling the pall) and<br />\nmiddies raced into defensh,e positions rather than the previous<br />\nyears' waving stick checks at<br />\nmidfield. Seaman was quick to<br />\npoint out the inexperience of the<br /><br />\nteam in the new system. \"This<br />\nwas only our second game against<br />\na different color jersey [the first<br />\nbeing a week earlier at Duke].<br />\nLast time we handled things well<br />\nbut now we know what to work<br />\non.

Going into this past<br />\nweek, they were coming off a<br />\n3-0-1 record in their last four<br />\nstarts, scoring nine goals in the<br />\nprocess while only allowing two.<br />\nThroughout this stretch they have<br />\nbeen playing with poise as well.<br />\nThe offense has managed to<br />\ncreate some stunning goals, while<br />\nthe defense has continued its<br />\nstellar play. But this, however,<br />\nwas before they entered contests<br />\nwith two of their toughest<br />\nchallenges of the season, Swarthmore and Mary Washington.<br />\nSaturday, October 13\u2014<br />\nSwarthmore College encroached the \"monster\" turf, where<br />\npreviously Hopkins was unbeaten<br />\nand unscored upon(8 goals-0). In<br />\nthe MAC Southeastern Championship last season, the Blue<br />\nJays defeated Swarthmore 1-0 on<br />\npenalty kicks and were looking on<br />\nthis rainy Saturday night to keep<br />\nup the winning tradition. A win<br />\nwould keep them in the running<br />\nfor the MAC Southeast title, and<br />\na possible, if however slim,<br />\nchance for an NCAA bid.<br />\nThe first half saw Swarthmore<br />\nopen up by attempting to take<br />\ncontrol of the game early. They<br />\nattacked the Hopkins side often,<br />\nwith all but two defensemen, in<br />\nhopes of opening up the scoring<br />\nearly. Hopkins was reserved to<br /><br />\nsitting back in more of 4 defensive mode and waiting for its opportunities. While they were content to wait, their unusual fan support for this game, led by the<br />\nfraternity Alpha Tau Omega, was<br />\nnot. ATO was indeed rowdy at<br />\nthis game, but they did indeed<br />\nadd to the flavor in a positive<br />\nway.<br />\nRising to the occasion under<br />\nthe Swarthmore pressure was<br />\nHopkins junior goalkeeper Jerry<br />\nIrvine, who managed to play the<br />\nslick astro-turf to perfection. Irvine came into the Swarthmore<br />\ngame with a .91 goals against<br />\naverage. Midway through the<br />\nfirst half, Swarthmore scored an<br />\napparent goal which for a moment ended the home field<br />\ndomination. This goal was<br />\ndisallowed, however, because of<br />\na Swarthmore penalty. But this<br />\nwas all Swarthmore would<br />\nmanage, for the Hopkins squad<br />\ntook over control of the game<br />\nsoon after this play. The first half<br />\nscore ended with a 0-0 tie, and<br />\nwith Hopkins knowing that they<br />\nhad to keep up the constant<br />\npressure and do something in the<br />\nsecond half to pull out the win.<br />\nA tie in this game would not help<br />\nthem in the MAC standings.<br />\nThe mood in the second half<br />\nwas extremely tense. While the<br />\nconstant chatterings from ATO<br />\nwere upbeat, and the Blue Jays attack was upbeat, they were still<br />\nnot managing to put the ball into<br />\nthe back of the net. Hopkins did<br />\nkeep the pressure on, barely<br />\nmissing on several close chances.<br />\nOne of these was a pass off a free<br /><br />\nkick which junior Omar<br />\nNicholson headed off the<br />\ncrossbar. Junior forward, Scott<br />\nWilson, came off the bench in the<br />\nsecond half and kept the Hopkins<br />\noffense running. Wilson's<br />\nballhandling abilities create excitement and almost led to a<br />\nHopkins goal. \"Swarthmore was<br />\nvery lucky in that some of our<br />\nshots were just off,\" commented<br />\nHopkins coach Mark Butler.<br />\nWith fifteen minutes to play,<br />\nthe nervousness of the Hopkins<br />\nteam was evident. By this time<br />\nthey were very frustrated by the<br />\nfact that they had still not scored.<br />\nThe Hopkins bench by this time<br />\nwas standing up, reacting to each<br />\nplay like it was the last play of the<br />\nseason. Hopkins coach Butler<br />\nshowed some emotion as well,<br />\nputting his hand to his chest and<br />\nlooking up to the sky just after<br />\nSwarthmore missed a scoring<br />\nopportunity.<br />\nWhat followed seemed like it<br />\nwas destined from the beginnng<br />\nof the game. The constant attack<br />\nand creative playmaking of the<br />\nHopkins forwards paid off. With<br />\njust under eleven minutes to play,<br />\nsenior co-captain Warren Jones<br />\nstood outside of the eighteen yard<br />\nbox with a free kick awaiting.<br />\nJones played the ball on the<br />\nground into the mass of players<br />\nstanding inside the box. Hopkins<br />\njunior forward Myles Flynn proceeded to fake a shot over the ball<br />\nand let the ball pass through his<br />\nlegs. This froze the Swarthmore<br />\ndefense and goalkeeper and the<br />\nball rolled leisurely into the left<br />\nContinued on page 17<br /><br />\nconsistent game of the year,<br />\ndespite three early interceptions<br />\nfrom Scott Cade. With Paul Ferreri still recovering from a<br />\nshoulder injury, Mont received<br />\nthe bulk of the running chores.<br />\nThe fullback did not disappoint,<br />\nas he rumbled for 93 yards on 16<br />\ncarries. Moreover, he caught two<br />\ntouchdown passes.<br />\n\"We came to play,\" said<br />\nMont. \"Any team can win on any<br />\ngiven day. It's just who wants it<br />\nmore.\"<br />\nThe defense, once again,<br />\ndelivered a stingy performance.<br />\nThe Jays sacked Muhlenberg's<br />\nquarterbacks five times, with two<br />\ncoming in the final minute of the<br />\ngame. Despite losing by three<br />\ntouchdowns, Muhlenberg moved<br />\nthe ball against Hopkins. The<br />\nMules had a first and goal on two<br />\nseparate drives, but could not<br />\nscore.<br />\n\"Our defense really played<br />\nwell again,\" said Margraff.\"We<br />\ngave up a couple of big plays, due<br />\nto blown coverages. We tried to<br />\nmake something happen and<br />\nMuhlenberg did a nice job in finding the open man.\"<br />\nThe Blue Jay defense looked<br />\nvery sharp on the opening drive.<br />\nAfter a half-back sweep and draw<br />\nplay were stifled by the Jays,<br />\nMuhlenberg's starting quarterback Mickey Rowe tried to<br />\nscramble for the first down. Stu<br />\nMarkley nearly decapitated the<br />\nquarterback, who was stopped a<br />\nyard short.<br />\nAfter a 26 yard punt, Hopkins<br />\nwent on a ten play drive that took<br />\nthem to Muhlenberg's 14 yard<br />\nline. Facing a third and eleven,<br />\nCade came under a heavy pass<br />\nrush and was intercepted by Mule<br />\nfree safety Clarke Paulus. The<br />\nJays offense returned immediately, after Brian Hepting intercepted Rowe on the very next<br />\nplay. From Muhlenberg's 24<br />\nyard line, the Jays needed four<br />\nplays before Cade found Mont on<br />\na screen pass that the fullback<br />\ntook 10 yards for the opening<br />\nscore. Trotta's kick made the<br />\nscore 7-0.<br />\nThe first quarter ended without<br />\na change in score, as the defense<br />\ncontinued to make an impression<br />\n(literally) on Muhlenberg.<br />\nMuhlenberg's offense made<br />\nsignificant gains in the second<br />\nquarter. However, their progress<br />\nwas continually retarded by the<br />\nBlue Jay pass rush. Frank<br />\nGangemi and Mark Labbe had<br />\nback to back sacks to quell<br />\nMuhlenberg's first drive in the<br />\nsecond quarter.<br />\nScott Cade, who finished the<br />\nday 16-25 for 182 yards, threw<br />\nhis third interception on the next<br /><br />\nseries, which gave Muhlenberg<br />\nthe ball inside the JHU 20.<br />\n\"The third interception was a<br />\nmisread,\" said Cade. \"I just<br />\ndidn't see the strong safety there.<br />\nOn the first two interceptions, I<br />\nwas trying to make something<br />\nhappen.\" Coach Mickey Rowe<br />\nquickly tied the game at 7 when<br />\nhe avoided the oncoming rush<br />\nand dashed into the endzone from<br />\n16 yards away.<br />\nThe Jays regained the lead with<br />\n35 seconds remaining in the half,<br />\nthanks to a juggling catch by<br />\nMont. The drive started four<br />\nminutes earlier with a series of<br />\nruns by Ferreri. The two week injury hiatus was not evident as<br />\nFerreri ran five times for 19 yards<br />\nin the drive. Mont's 16 yard run<br />\noff a draw gave Hopkins a first<br />\ndown from Muhlenberg's 43 yard<br />\nline. Cade began to warm up by<br />\ncompleting passes to Joe Richards<br />\nand Steve Lewis for a first down.<br />\nFrom the Mules' 32, Cade teamed up with Dave Cosenza on a<br />\nbeautiful timing pass down the<br />\nsidelines for a first and goal from<br />\nthe five. That set up Cade's two<br />\nyard toss to Mont, which was<br />\nthrown behind the receiver and<br />\nrequired Mont to spin around and<br />\ntip the ball in the air, before corralling it for the score. Marzio<br />\nTrotta missed the extra point, giving Hopkins a 13-7 lead at<br />\nhalftime.<br />\n\"Erik had an awesome game,\"<br />\nsaid Margraff. \"It was probably<br />\nthe best overall game from one of<br />\nour backs this year.

After collecting<br />\nthemselves in the second half,<br />\nHopkins tied the score on a ball<br />\nrun by junior Scott Haag. Haag<br />\npicked up a loose ball, put his<br />\nhead down, and headed for the<br />\ngoal line. Along the way, i,!indy<br />\nPiasecki came in from behind to<br />\nhelp push Scott into the try zone.<br />\nWhen told later that Piasecki had<br />\npushed him into the try zone,<br />\nHaag responded \"No wonder! I<br />\nnever ran that fast in my life!\"<br />\nFrom that point on, the tide<br />\nturned in Hopkins' favor as they<br />\nrepeatedly drove into AU's territory. The final try of the day<br />\ncame when sophomore inside<br />\ncenter Matt Shive neatly plucked a pass from AU's outside<br />\ncenter and broke a tackle to sprint<br />\nin for the try.

Five minutes before the<br />\nhalf, Hopkins displayed some<br />\nperfect rugby that advanced the<br />\nball the length of the field. The<br />\nplay ended on Joe McCullough's<br />\npass to Paul Kang, who took the<br />\nball in for the try. The score was<br />\n16-10 at the half.<br />\nIn the second. half, Shive tied<br />\nthe game with two penalty kicks<br />\n(he ended the day 4-6). The score<br />\nstayed tied with just five minutes<br />\nto go when Mount scored on a<br />\nkick to take a 19-16 lead.<br /><br />\nHopkins seemed out of it at this<br />\npoint, but with just one minute<br />\nleft in the game,junior eight-man<br />\nJulian Edwards weaved through<br />\nthe faltering Mount defense to<br />\nscore the game-winning try. The<br />\nfinal score was 22-19. The B-side<br />\nsuffered a narrow 6-4 loss to<br />\nMount.

They hosted<br />\nFrostburg State University on the<br />\nBIA field before a standing-roomonly crowd (of mostly Frostburg<br />\nState University fans). The game<br />\nwas a rout from the beginning as<br />\nHopkins thoroughly dominated<br />\nall facets of play. The scrum was<br />\nespecially effective at driving.<br />\nhack the bigger and stronger op=<br />\nponent. The first try of the day<br />\ncame in the first half as freshman<br />\nwinger Pete Feldman, playing in<br />\nhis first A-side game, lunged into the corner of the try zone to<br />\ngive Hopkins a quick 4-0 lead.<br />\nMinutes later, Frostburg made it<br />\nclose on a penalty kick, leaving<br />\nthe score 4-3.

Continuing the onslaught, Edwards took<br />\nthe ball on an eight-man keeper<br />\nand lunged in for his second try<br />\nof the season. Todd Fatsullo<br />\nmade an incredible conversion<br />\nkick from the far-right corner that<br />\ncurved beautifully through the<br />\nuprights to play as a desperate<br />\nFrostburg squad tried to come<br />\nfrom behind. Frostburg managed only one try, leaving the final<br />\nat 16-9.<br />\nThe Hopkins B-side was lead<br />\nby tries from Josh Flavers, Ethan<br />\nBrown, and Andy Lerner as<br />\nHopkins pulled out an 18-12 victory in double overtime.<br /><br />\nClark Kicks<br />\nby Jason Stevens<br />\nOn Saturday, October 13th, the<br />\nNational Collegiate Karate<br />\nAssociation's 1990 National<br />\nChampionship was held in<br />\nDenver. Colorado. Last year's<br />\nJEW Shotokan Karate Team Captain, Adam Clark competed in the<br />\nall day event. He placed fourth in<br />\nthe advanced Kata (forms) competition, which is a prearranged<br />\nseries of techniques. In so doing<br />\nhe championed all the brown belt<br />\nand East Coast competitors.<br />\nAlthough he faulted in the final<br />\nround of Kata competition Clark<br />\nwas very pleased with his performance. He also placed in the top<br />\neight tbr Kumite (free sparing) by<br />\nadvancing to the quarter finals,<br />\nwhere he was defeated by black<br />\nbelt Morris Kennedy of Temple<br />\nUniversity.<br />\nAlthough Clark trains almost<br /><br />\nWomen's soccer has come to<br />\nthe close of its third season with<br />\na I - 1 tie against Loyola, in what<br />\nwas probably one of Hopkins'<br />\nbiggest games of the season.<br />\nLoyola, like Hopkins, is a club<br />\nteam, but they are a Division I<br />\nschool, so many of their team<br />\nmembers are accomplished<br />\nathletes. Thus, the women expected the game -to be a close<br />\nmatch-up, but they hoped they<br />\ncould finish the season with a big<br />\nwin. Instead they got close competition which proved to be too<br />\ntough to overcome.<br />\nHopkins stuck with the 2-4-4<br />\nformation (the use of two forwards, four halfbacks, and four<br />\nfullbacks for more support<br />\nthrough the middle) that they had<br />\nsuccessfully initiated against<br />\nMount Saint Mary's in the<br />\nprevious game, but that was not<br />\nenough to throw Loyola off, and<br />\nHopkins went into half time down<br />\nby 1. According to sophomore<br />\nJackie Fiehler, who was the goal<br />\nkeeper during the first half,<br />\n\"Loyola had a lot of really close<br />\nshots on goal,\" but Hopkins'<br />\ndefense played very well and was<br />\nable to block some very good<br />\nkicks. Fiehler went on to say,<br />\n\"Loyola and Hopkins are about<br />\nat the same level, so the game<br /><br />\nwas really good competition for<br />\nus.\"<br />\nHopkins made their comeback<br />\nin the second half when<br />\nsophomore Sarah Cushing scored<br />\nan unassisted goal. Coach Chuck<br />\nConnolly then decided to relieve<br />\nFiehler in the goal and put in<br />\nfreshman Sara Appleman. From<br />\nthen on both teams played extremely tough games so they were<br />\nable to prevent any further scoring, and that is the way the game<br />\nended.<br />\nOverall, the women on the<br />\nteam seem to feel that they played<br />\na very good game against Loyola,<br />\nand while a victory would have<br />\nbeen a great way to end the<br />\nseason, they played an excellent,<br />\nsolid game anyway. Fiehler even<br />\nsuggested that this game was one<br />\nof their best of the season.<br />\nMandy Weiss, a sophomore on<br />\nthe team said, \"We have gotten<br />\nmuch better; we've improved our<br />\npassing game and our teamwork<br />\nskills, it's just that they (Loyola)<br />\nhave really strong skills too.\"<br />\nWeiss noted, though, that she did<br />\nnot feel that Hopkins had as many<br />\nchances at scoring as Loyola had.<br />\nOverall, Loyola probably had<br />\nmore close shots on goal than<br />\nHopkins, but at least they were<br />\nnot able to convert them to points.<br />\nWeiss, as well as junior Heidi<br />\nContinued on page 17<br /><br />\neveryday throughout the year, he<br />\ncredits his performance to the<br />\nability of his instructor, Najib<br />\nAmin, and to a little luck, because<br />\nas he said, \"At this level of competition, minute factors make the<br />\ndifference.\" In reference to the<br />\nfirst of this season's East Coast<br />\nCollegiate Karate Union's tournaments, which will be held at<br />\nJHU on Saturday, October 27,<br />\nClark said that his performance<br />\nat Denver was no indication of<br />\nhow he will do again versus East<br />\nCoast Champions Ross Chasson<br />\nof Drexel University and Morris<br />\nKennedy of Temple University.<br />\nHe also noted that the young<br />\nHopkins team shows great promise for the coming season.

By recording their<br />\nseventh shutout of the season, the<br />\nBlue lays improved their record<br />\nto 8-3-2. The Jays beat Goucher<br />\nwith their most prolific offensive<br />\neffort of the season. On the way<br />\nto knocking out the starting<br />\nGopher goalie, the Jays spread<br />\nfive first half goals among four<br />\nplayers.<br />\nUnlike most of their past<br />\ngames, Hopkins took control of<br />\nthe ball early in the first half. Only five minutes into the contest,<br />\nHopkins opened the scoring when<br />\nsophomore forward Roxanne<br />\nTena knocked in a pass from<br />\nsenior co-captain Kathy Herring.<br />\nFive minutes later, from an<br />\nalmost identical spot, freshman<br />\nscoring sensation Beth Cariello<br />\npushed in a loose ball for her<br />\neighth goal of the season.<br />\nHopkins continued to score at<br />\nregular intervals throughout the<br />\nfirst half as they pounded the<br />\nGoucher goal. Sophomore Donna Williamson scored the Jays'<br />\nthird goal of the game and her<br />\nthird of the season midway<br />\nthrough the half. Tena recorded<br />\nher second goal of the game six<br />\nminutes later, giving her six for<br />\nthe season. Finally, with eight<br />\nminutes remaining in the half,<br />\nsenior Jen Chun closed out the<br />\nscoring as she whacked a rebound<br />\ninto an open goal. The goal was<br />\nher fburth of the season. That was<br />\nall the Goucher goalie could handle. During the next stoppage of<br />\nplay the lone Gopher reserve<br />\nreplaced the starting goalie.<br />\nAt the start of the second half,<br />\nHopkins coach Sally Beth Anderson wed similar strategy by<br />\n1,piacing four starters with<br />\nreserves. The largely freshman<br />\nsquad continued to pressure the<br />\nGopher goal but did allow<br /><br />\nGoucher two good scoring opportunities. Blue Jays's goalie Alec<br />\nKing was equal to the test. The<br />\nfirst Goucher chance was a high<br />\nshot from close in that King<br />\nknocked wide. During the closing minutes of the game Goucher<br />\nhad another chance as one of their<br />\nplayers broke through the Jays'<br />\ndefense. However, King made a<br />\nspectacular sliding save to<br />\npreserve the shutout.<br />\nSaturday, October 13\u2014<br />\nHopkins hosted undefeated<br />\nBloomsburg, the number one<br />\nteam in Division III Field<br />\nHockey. As could be expected,<br />\nthe Jays suffered their third loss<br />\nof the season as they were<br />\nshutout, 2-0, for the first time this<br />\nyear. According to Anderson, it<br />\n\"was the first time we've played<br />\nthem. They were really good.\"<br />\nWithout the services of senior<br />\ndefender Courtney DeVries or<br />\nsenior midfielder Meredith Blitz,<br />\nHopkins was forced to play<br />\ndefense for most of the game.<br />\nWhile King was busy making 13<br />\nsaves, the offense managed only<br />\n5 shots (only two of which were<br />\non goal). However, Anderson<br />\nwas satisfied with the \"good effort\" of her squad on their only<br />\npenalty corner of the game.<br />\n\"Beth ICariello] got the shot<br />\naway but it just missed,\" she<br />\nsaid.<br />\nAnderson was impressed by the<br />\ncaliber of Bloomsburg's play.<br />\n\"They played a very controlled<br />\ngame. They used the whole field<br />\nand had a great stick to stick passing.\" If there is a positive side in<br />\nlosing to a top ranked team,<br />\nAnderson sure found it. \"I like<br />\nto play a quality team like that to<br />\nlet us get better.\"<br />\nIn other notes, freshman<br />\ndefender Sonia Dickson returned<br />\nto full-time action after being<br />\nlimited by an injury.

And it's tired of<br />\nwatching Detroit streets flooded<br />\nwith jubilation.<br />\nFive of the top seven professional basketball teams played out<br />\nwest last year. Only the Pistons<br />\nand Bulls represented the Eastern<br />\nConference in the league's elite<br />\nduring the 1989-90 campaign.<br />\nThat should not change this<br />\nseason.

Once hapless, the<br />\nSuns were one Kevin Johnsonpulled hamstring away from playing the Pistons in last year's<br />\nfinals. Johnson, the lightningquick point guard, and power forward Tom Chambers are the<br />\nheart and soul of the team, but the<br />\nrest of the body is pretty healthy<br />\nas well. Guard Jeff Hornacek,<br />\ncenter Mark West, and swingman<br />\nDan Majerle are all budding<br />\nstars. Eddie Johnson, Kurt Rambis, Ed Nealy, and a cast of<br />\ntalented thousands will lend<br />\nRoe!<br />\n%Iegele k:iignt ma:<br />\ncon, but ions.

Portland has added<br />\nguard Danny Ainge to the bebt<br />\nstartinglive in the league, taking<br /><br />\ncare of their two major<br />\nweaknesses\u2014depth and outside<br />\nshooting. It may be enough to win<br />\nthe West again. In Utah, twentyfour point scorer Jeff Malone has<br />\nbeen added to superhuman forward Karl Malone (no relation)<br />\nand assist champ John Stockton.<br />\nThe Jazz would now win any<br />\nthree-on-three tournament, but<br />\ntheir bench is still suspect. Any<br />\nteam that adds a deadly shooter<br />\nto a group that won fifty-five<br />\ngames the previous year,<br />\nhowever, has to be considered a<br />\ncontender.<br />\nLast season, the San Antonio<br />\nSpurs were the NBA's most improved club. It was no coincidence that center David Robinson entered the league last year.<br />\nThe \"Admiral\" is everything he<br />\nwas advertised and more. Forward Terry Cummings and<br />\nswingmen Willie Anderson and<br />\nSean Elliot make for a nice support cast. Newcomer Paul<br />\nPressey comes over from<br />\nMilwaukee to tutor Rod<br />\nStrickland at point guard. If<br />\nStrickland reaches his potential<br />\n(and avoids the playoff jitters he<br />\nshowed last year), the Spurs will<br />\nlikely be Phoenix's major<br />\nchallengers.<br />\nDallas picked up forwards<br />\nRodney McCray and Alex<br />\nEnglish along with guard Fat<br />\nLever. Lever's acquisition is interesting because, with Derek<br />\nHarper and Rolando Blackman,<br />\nthe Mavericks already had one of<br />\nthe league's top backcourts. Expect Dallas to struggle at first to<br />\nfind the right chemistry. But, if<br />\npower forward Roy Tarpley stays<br />\ndrug-free rind the newcomers<br />\njust the, will make some playoff<br />\nnoise. What about the Lakers?<br />\nThey lost guard Michael Cooper<br />\nand forward Orlando Woolridge,<br />\nbut added forwards Sam Perkins<br />\nand Terry Teagle. The changes,<br />\nincluding Pat Riley's departure<br />\nwon't affect the team as much as<br />\nthe new Western attitude will.<br />\nThe aura of invincibility is gone;<br />\nPhoenix proved last year that the<br /><br />\nward Otis Thorpe must carry<br />\nmore of the load. Golden State<br />\nhas a wonderful backcourt and a<br />\ngreat player, forward Chris<br />\nMullin, but still lacks muscle.<br />\nDenver, Sacramento, Minnesota, and Orlando will bring up<br />\nthe rear. Denver and Sacramento are rebuilding with rookies(expect Denver guard Chris Jackson<br />\nto be rookie of the year), and<br />\nMinnesota and Orlando are just<br />\nlooking for any sort of<br />\nimprovement.<br />\nUntil someone beats them, the<br />\nEast's Detroit Pistons have to be<br />\nconsidered the favorites. This<br />\nyear, someone will beat them.<br />\nThe Pistons are growing old<br />\nbefore their time, and have yet to<br />\nsign guard Vinnie \"Microwave\"<br />\nJohnson. Joe Dumars and Isiah<br />\nThomas are terrific guards, and<br />\nDennis Rodman is a defensive<br />\nmonster. It's about time, though,<br />\nthat Chicago solves the Piston<br /><br />\nLakers can be beaten.<br />\nA mad scramble for the final<br />\ntwo spots should happen, as the<br />\nClippers, Sonics, Rockets, and<br />\nWarriors are all solid clubs. In<br />\ntwo years, the Clippers might be<br />\nLos Angeles' trendy team. Forwards Danny Manning, Charles<br />\nSmith, and Ken Norman are all<br />\nimproving, and guard Gary Grant<br />\nhas recovered from a broken<br />\nankle. Rookie Bo Kimble will<br />\ncapably hold down the off guard<br />\nspot until superstar Ron Harper<br />\nreturns from knee surgery in<br />\nJanuary. Seattle's situation is<br />\nmuddled, with 6'9\"Michael Cage<br />\nat center and forward Xavier<br />\nMcDaniel unhappy, but if rookie<br />\nShawn Kemp is as good as his<br />\nflashes of brilliance promise, and<br />\nPayton is as good as he says he<br />\nis, the Sonits will surprise.<br />\nHouston is still the home of the<br />\nAkeem Olajumon one-man-show,<br />\nand guard Sleepy Floyd and for-<br /><br />\nriddle.<br />\nThe Chicago Jordans (oops,<br />\nBulls) are loaded with good<br />\nyoung players like guard B.J.<br />\nArmstrong and forwards Scottie<br />\nPippen, Horace Grant, and<br />\nStacey King. All conversations,<br />\nhowever, start and end with<br />\nMichael Jordan. He won't let his<br />\nteam lose this year, at least not<br />\nto Detroit. Expect the Bulls to<br />\nfinally reach the Championship<br />\nSeries.<br />\nIn Philadelphia, fans believe<br />\nthey have a top contender. They<br />\ndo, but only for the Atlantic Division title. Forward Charles<br />\nBarkley is spectacular, and the<br />\nHawkins-Johnny<br />\nHersey<br />\nDawkins backcourt is emerging.<br />\nBut there is still not enough<br />\ndepth. The New York Knicks<br />\nhave decided to build around<br />\nPatrick Ewing, which is a smart<br />\nidea. What was not so<br />\nthough, was letting the rest of the<br />\nteam deteriorate. Johnny<br />\nNewman and Rod Strickland are<br />\ngone, and guard Mark Jackson<br />\nmight as well be (would someone<br />\nplease tell him he is not Magic<br />\nJohnson?). At the Boston Garden,<br />\nthe graybeards are back for one<br />\nmore turn, supported by guards<br />\nReddie Lewis and Brian Shaw.<br />\nTime is definitely not on their<br />\nside.<br />\nCleveland had better hope that<br />\nforwards Danny Ferry and Hot<br />\nRod Williams excel, for all the<br />\ntrouble the front office went<br />\nthrough to get them. As hard as<br />\ngeneral manager Wayne Embry<br />\nhas tried to screw things up, a<br />\nnucleus of guard Mark Price,<br />\ncenter Brad Daugherty, and forward Larry Nance might be<br />\nenough to lift the Cavaliers into<br />\na contending spot.<br />\nIndiana,<br />\nAtlanta,<br />\nand<br />\nMilwaukee will attempt to win<br />\nthe last two playoff positions.<br />\nBehind guard Reggie Miller and<br />\nforward Detlef Schrempf, the<br />\nPacers made strides last year. A<br />\nfocussed Chuck Person is needed to put them over the top. In<br />\nAtlanta, there aren't enough<br /><br />\nbasketballs for all the ballhogs<br />\n(forward Dominique Wilkins and<br />\ncenter Moses Malone are the<br />\nmain culprits). Guards Rumeal<br />\nRobinson (a rookie) and Doc ,<br />\nRivers(a leader) will have to take<br />\ncontrol. Meanwhile, the Bucks<br />\nmight have the slowest frontcourt<br />\nin the history of the NBA. Coach<br />\nDel Harris finds a way to win<br />\ngames, however, and the Bucks<br />\n(behind guard Alvin Robertson)<br />\nwill be a thorn in many a contender's side.<br />\nAs the Bullets, Nets, and<br />\nHornets continue to flounder, the<br />\nMiami Heat should be greatly improved. Center Rony Seilkaly,<br />\nforward Glen Rice, and guard<br />\nSherman Douglas (along with<br />\nrookies Willie Burton and Alec<br />\nKessler) form a promising<br />\nnucleus.

The pushing<br />\nand tripping ended up frustrating<br />\nand enraging many of the<br />\nHopkins women. One woman<br />\nfrom Loyola was thrown out of<br />\nthe game because she first kicked the goal keeper while the goal<br />\nkeeper had the ball, and then she<br />\ntried to hit one of the Hopkins<br />\nplayers.

Hopkins co-captain<br />\nGeoff Manning and leader of the<br />\nteam's defense commented on the<br />\nvictory, \"Swarthmore had a<br />\nlimited attack and our defense<br />\nreally played well. We were<br />\nlucky in that we got a lot of<br />\nchances off of set plays and that<br />\nwe were able to converge on<br />\none.\"<br />\nSenior defenseman John Martinie added, \"This was the first<br />\ngame where we played really well<br />\nas a team.

However, they were not<br />\nable to finish on any of these<br />\nchances.<br />\nAfter a scoreless first half in<br />\nwhich Hopkins proved to<br />\nthemselves that they could do<br />\nmuch more than keep up with the<br />\nnumber five team in the nation,<br />\nthey were ready to continue the<br />\nattack in the second. With aieir<br />\nown offense failing, Washington<br />\nwas forced to try to play the ball<br />\nover the Hopkins defenders, a<br />\ntactic which proved just as<br />\nfruitless. In their way was the<br />\n6'6\" frame of stopper Geoff<br />\nManning, who dominated the<br />\ngame in the air. Also aiding Manning in the backfield were<br />\ndefensemen John Martinie, Nick<br />\nMartin, and Mike Vandekieft,<br />\nwho all played well under the<br />\npressure of the contest.<br />\nAs the game progressed,<br />\nHopkins was still attacking<br />\nconstantly.<br />\n\"Come on.

At stake for Hopkins<br />\nwas a possible shot at an NCAA<br />\nbid and a chance to gain the<br />\nrespect of soccer programs all<br />\nacross the country. Going into the<br />\ngame, Hopkins co-captain Warren Jones said simply, \"it's a<br />\ngrudge match. We lost to them<br />\n1-0 last year, and we don't want<br />\nthe same to happen.\"<br />\nThe Washington team was obviously not prepared for the<br />\nHopkins squad which played probably its best game of the season.<br />\nThis game was truly a pleasure<br />\nto watch, as teamwork, aggressive play, and constant<br />\npressure were exhibited for 120<br />\nminutes.<br />\nThe first half saw Hopkins<br />\nforce the pressure entirely. Mary<br />\nWashington players would.<br />\nreceive the ball and almost immediately have it stolen away by<br />\na Hopkins player. This sent a<br />\nclear message to the Washington<br />\nside as to what the Blue Jay's intentions were for the game. The<br />\nmidfielders especially were instrumental in not allowing the<br />\nWashington side to advance the<br />\nball past midfield. Once Hopkins<br />\nhad the ball, they were able to<br />\ndistribute it to all areas of the<br />\nfield. Leading the way for the<br />\nJays in this department was Omar<br />\nNicholson. Nicholson was involved throughout and used a deft<br />\ntouch to drive by Washington<br />\nplayers and pass the ball off.<br />\nSimilar to the Swarthmore<br />\ngame, while Hopkins did control<br />\nmuch of the play, they also had<br />\ntrouble converting a goal.

Meeting the attempted outlet pass at midfield<br />\nwas Nicholson, who played the<br />\nball ahead to streaking Jones.<br />\nCatching the Washington defense<br />\nby surprise, Jones found himself<br />\nalone and proceeded to take one<br />\ndribble and then blast a shot at the<br />\ngoal. His shot, however, sailed<br />\njust high of the net. On another<br />\nattempt, defender Nick Martin<br />\ncaught the ball off of a bounce<br />\nand shot for the corner, only to<br />\nhave the Washington goalkcpper<br />\ndive and catch the ball. These<br />\nnear misses were just two of the<br />\nchances Hopkins had. The teams<br />\nwere forced to go into overtime<br />\nin the scoreless game.<br />\nAll that was remaining were<br />\ntwo 15-minute overtime periods<br />\nin which both teams failed to<br />\nscore. There were few chances<br />\nfor either team even though<br />\nHopkins maintained their exceptional level of play.

The reactions in<br />\nthe media and in both the<br />\nwhite and black communities,<br />\nto the recent Marion Barry<br />\ntrial and the the violent attacks<br />\nin Central Park, Howard<br />\nBeach, and Bensonhurst in New<br />\nYork demonstrate that both<br /><br />\nWhy should innocent<br />\nwhites pay the<br />\npenalty for<br />\ndiscrimination?<br />\nblacks and whites are becoming increasingly frustrated with<br />\nrecent trends in race relations.<br />\nBut why has opposition to<br />\naffirmative action in particular<br />\nbecome the principal means<br />\nfor whites to vent their unhappiness with race relations?<br />\nSimply put, these whites see<br />\nthe hypocrisy in legalizing a<br />\nsystem of discrimination so<br />\nshortly after the civil rights<br />\nmovement of the Sixties<br />\nsought to bring an end to judging a people by the color of<br />\ntheir skin. Calling affirmative<br />\naction a \"necessary evil\"<br />\nneeded for minorities to improve their standing only reinforces the idea that affirmative<br />\naction is, indeed, \"evil\" and<br />\nwrong.<br />\nConsequently, when they<br />\nhear of programs designed to<br />\nincrease minority representation, many whites see<br />\nthemselves as victims of<br />\nlegalized discrimination. They<br />\nmay wonder, for examale,<br /><br />\nwhy a white must be denied<br />\nadmission to a university in an<br />\nattempt to atone for past<br />\nwrongs. Why should he or she<br />\npay the penalty of discrimination? Why is he or she to<br />\nblame?<br />\nSeeing the success Duke enjoyed in playing off white<br />\nresentment over issues such as<br />\naffirmative action may lead<br />\nother politicians to start emphasizing racially-motivated<br />\nissues. Howell believes that<br />\n\"we will see candidates in<br />\nother places being more blunt<br />\nabout racial issues. 'Duke] is<br />\nthe strongest voice of white<br />\nbacklash that we have heard,<br />\nbut there will be more<br />\nvoices.\"<br />\nWhites therefore seem to be<br />\nlooking for outlets for their<br />\nfrustrations over such an impractical policy. They have no<br />\ndesire to see this legalized<br />\ndiscrimination continue. Thus,<br />\nthe rise of a politician like<br />\nDuke, who capitalized on<br />\nracial resentment, should not<br />\ncome as much of a surprise.<br />\nDavid Duke himself will<br />\nsoon run out of steam; his outwardly racist past will eventually overwhelm his crafty<br />\npolitical rhetoric. But the<br />\ntheme of racial resentment in<br />\npolitics will likely be employed<br />\nwith more and more frequency by more mainstream politicians in the near future, seeing what kind of success they<br />\nmay be able to enjoy by doing<br />\nso.<br />\nWhites are not to be held as<br />\nracists for being resentful of<br />\nsuch policies.

Your job is to identify<br />\nthe two other people in said triangle. (Hint: Triangle<br />\nmeans three people. Extra answers will only detract from<br />\nyour score.) In the case of more than one triangle (the<br />\ndog!), stick with the most famous one. As usual, get<br />\nyour answers to the Gatehouse by 5 o'clock Wednesday or face rejection.

Anyone who submitted a correct entry<br />\nabout one of his kid's deaths got it. Secondly, I also admit to having muffed 9uestion 16. The twins I was referring to were not, in fact, the sons of Llyr, but the sons<br />\nof Euroswydd by Llyr's wife. Too bad I didn't think<br />\nof that in time for this week's quiz. Thanks (and, of<br />\ncourse, kudos) go to Adrianne Pierce and Dana<br />\nMarinacci for pointing that out, though this week's meat<br />\nand venison go to Walt \"I Even Knew Beowulf's<br />\nFourth Monster\" Schalick for work above and beyond<br />\nthe call of duty in listing every child Llyr, his wife, and<br />\nperhaps even their dog ever had. It just goes to show<br />\nyou, verbosity can sometimes win the day. Anyway, to<br />\nthe point: 1) Zeus-commanded Hephaestus to create her<br />\nto punish Prometheus and mankind for Prometheus' theft<br />\nof fire. (As entrant Laura Nagel put it, \"See, we have<br />\na divine ordinance!\") 2) Asclepius, killed by Zeus for<br />\nraising the dead; Phaeton, killed by Zeus for joyriding<br />\nin Apollo's chariot; Orpheus, who was devoured by<br />\nmaenads, Linus, killed by a harp thrown at him by Hercules, among others, 3) She sprang full-grown from<br />\nZeus' head after Zeus had swallowed his first wife,<br />\nMetis, 4) Jason and the Argonauts, and a fleece is the<br />\nwooly hide of a ram, 5) Strangling the Nemean Lion,<br />\nkilling the Lernaean Hydra, capturing an exceedingly<br />\nfleet stag, capturing a wild boar, cleaning the Augean<br />\nstables, destroying the Stymphalian birds, capturing the<br />\nCretan bull, capturing the mares of Diomedes, stealing<br />\nthe girdle of Hippolyta, killing King Geryon and cap-<br /><br />\nPhotographs by Donna Williamson<br /><br />\n:<br /><br />\nC<br /><br />\nEY!

As entrant Charles Kinsky said,<br />\n\"For ten years her suitors were too stupid to notice.\"<br />\n9) Viii and Ve (in other texts, Hoenir and Lodur), 10)<br />\nIn Asgard, and the souls of dead warriors eat there with<br />\nOdin and his hounds, 11) His brother Hodur, with a<br />\nmistletoe arrow given to him by Loki, 12) a) The Fenris<br />\nWolf, b)The Midgard Serpent, c) Thor, 13) Trick question. His foster brother was Sir Kay, he had no real<br />\nbrother, 14) Sir Galahad, and a hand from heaven took<br />\nit away (though kudos go to Charles Kinsky, Adrianne<br />\nPierce and Dana Marinacci who also credited Indiana<br />\nJones with finding it. Alas, Monty Python never actually<br />\nfound it.) 15) Pwyll and Manawyddan, 16) Grr. Don't<br />\nask me about this. Bran and Manawyddan were Llyr's<br />\nsons, Nissyen and Evnissyen were their half-brothers.<br />\nThere were others, but you can ask Walt about those.<br />\n17) He was a bard (that was really all I needed, though<br />\nI gave credit to people who told me interesting stories.)<br />\n18) Grendel, his mom (Grendel's. . .not Beowulf's)and<br />\nthe Dragon, 19) As a youth, he killed the guard hound<br />\nof the smith Cullen, whose grief caused him to sub for<br />\nthe hound until a replacement could be found.
