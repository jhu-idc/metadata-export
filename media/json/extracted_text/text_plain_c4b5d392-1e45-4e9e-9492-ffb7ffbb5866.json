That \"what\" I'm<br />\nspeaking of is the music scene at<br />\nHopkins. Two years ago there was<br />\nlittle musical entertainment<br />\navailable at Hopkins, with. the<br />\nexception of the nine. years<br />\nrunning Shriver Hall Concert<br />\nSeries. But many things have<br />\nhappened to change that, among<br />\nthem changes in the personnel and<br />\npolicies of the student council and<br />\nparticularly the Student Activities<br />\nCommission: as well as the<br />\nformation of Flying Monkey, an<br />\nindependent musical organization<br />\nheaded by Bill Ferguson.<br />\nLast year saw three \"name\"<br />\nbands at Hopkins: -Jonathan<br />\nEdwards (which lost a considerable<br />\namount of money).

A second<br />\nconcert. featuring John<br />\nMcGlaughlin, is planned for<br />\nOctober. If the McGlaughlin<br />\nconcert is successful we may look<br />\nforward to other \"big name\"<br />\nconcerts this year on a regular<br />\nbasis.<br />\nAlive and Well<br />\nIn addition to the concerts<br />\nfeaturing contemporary music. the<br />\nShriver Hall Concert Series is very<br />\nmuch alive and well this year.<br />\nHeaded by 'Jeanne Fineberg, the<br />\nconcert series offers classical music<br />\nat extremely reasonable rates<br />\n(51.50 student admission) and is<br />\nopen to the community as well.<br />\nThe 'concert series has a board<br />\ncomposed of faculty. community<br />\nmembers and students who decide<br />\non the performers to be engaged<br />\nand who decide on the concert<br />\nseries' policies.

(Note:<br />\nMrs. Fineberg's office is moving<br />\nshortly to Shriver Hall). These are<br />\ninternational performers from all<br />\nover the world and all are<br />\ngenuinely worth seeing\u2014especially<br />\nwith the ticket prices what they<br />\nare. The concert series was just<br />\ndonated a beautiful new Steinway<br />\nfrom Germany, which is saving<br />\nthem a rental fee of S300 for every<br />\nconcert demanding a piano, and<br />\nthis is but one of the many<br />\ngenerous gifts which helps keep the<br />\nticket prices down.<br />\nJust as important as the \"big<br />\nname\" concerts at Hopkins are all<br />\nof the smaller happenings. There is<br />\nquite a bit of student participation<br />\nin the various performances on<br />\ncampus. Starting tonight at the<br />\nRathskeller is the \"open mike\".<br />\nThis is an S.A.C. sponsored event<br />\nwhich is being headed up by Mitch<br />\nClarvit. The \"open mike\" is<br />\nanybody's opportunity to express<br />\nthemselves in whatever manner<br />\nthey choose, be it singing. playing<br />\ninstruments, dancing, telling jokes<br />\nor doing a cook show. Quite a few<br />\npeople have already gotten in<br />\ntouch with the S.A.C. to express<br />\nan interest in contributing. If you<br />\nhaven't gotten in touch with the<br />\n\"open mike\" organizers and would<br />\nlike to participate,just come to the<br />\n\"open mike\" at the Rathskeller<br />\nany Tuesday night and strut your<br />\nstuff.<br />\nShell Out<br />\nAnd that's not all that's being<br />\nplanned for the Union. The formal<br />\ndedication will be held sometime<br />\nin October and will be a gala<br />\nweekend of music. food, a play (or<br />\nplays). and many surprises as well.<br />\nIn addition, the possibility of a<br />\nfine sound system for the Union is<br />\nbeing kicked around. Some S.A.C.<br />\nmembers are investigating<br />\nequipment and prices. and some<br />\nothers are trying to finagle ways of<br />\ngetting the necessary funds. The<br />\nstudent council might be<br />\nconvinced' to shell out the dough<br />\n(in the S3000 range) if it can be<br />\nshown that the purchasing of the<br />\nsystem would save money in other<br />\nrespects. Says Alan Sapakie. \"if the<br />\nsystem were one that would be<br />\nsuitable for outdoor use as well as<br />\nindoor, then we would save money<br />\nby nor having to \u2022send for Flight<br />\nThree Sound to come down and<br />\n<br />\nset up.\" Hopefully reasoning like<br />\nthat may convince the S.C. of the<br />\nnecessity of a good sound system.<br />\nWe can also look forward to the<br />\nclass- and fraternity contributions<br />\nto the entertainment situation. The<br />\nclasses didn't seem too lively when<br />\nit came to partying last<br />\nyear\u2014maybe this year they'll roll<br />\nover and rally a bit.

The local bands encountered<br />\nso far generally haven't been very<br />\ngood, but Baltimore is-a big town<br />\nand some good bands will<br />\nundoubtedly turn up.<br />\nAll in all, it looks promising<br />\naround here.

It is a great<br />\nsorrow for me, personally, that, as<br />\nMr. Chavez pointed out, they who<br />\nproduced the food in this country<br />\nhave no food themselves. These are<br />\nthe nearly three million American<br />\nmigrant farm workers, twenty five<br />\npercent of whom are children. Yet<br />\nthey are quite fortunate to be<br />\nchildren, for the infant mortality<br />\nrate is fully two hundred and fifty<br />\npercent higher than the national<br />\naverage, and they can expect to<br />\nlive to an average age of forty-nine,<br />\ntwenty years less than the national<br />\naverage.

That \"what\" I'm<br />\nspeaking of is the music scene at<br />\nHopkins. Two years ago there was<br />\nlittle musical entertainment<br />\navailable at Hopkins, with. the<br />\nexception of the nine. years<br />\nrunning Shriver Hall Concert<br />\nSeries. But many things have<br />\nhappened to change that, among<br />\nthem changes in the personnel and<br />\npolicies of the student council and<br />\nparticularly the Student Activities<br />\nCommission: as well as the<br />\nformation of Flying Monkey, an<br />\nindependent musical organization<br />\nheaded by Bill Ferguson.<br />\nLast year saw three \"name\"<br />\nbands at Hopkins: -Jonathan<br />\nEdwards (which lost a considerable<br />\namount of money).

We should<br />\nbe able to expect at least three<br />\nconcerts this year.<br />\nThe Herbie Mann concert lost a<br />\n'moderate sum of money. but was<br />\nextremely successful in that<br />\neveryone liked it. A second<br />\nconcert. featuring John<br />\nMcGlaughlin, is planned for<br />\nOctober. If the McGlaughlin<br />\nconcert is successful we may look<br />\nforward to other \"big name\"<br />\nconcerts this year on a regular<br />\nbasis.<br />\nAlive and Well<br />\nIn addition to the concerts<br />\nfeaturing contemporary music. the<br />\nShriver Hall Concert Series is very<br />\nmuch alive and well this year.<br />\nHeaded by 'Jeanne Fineberg, the<br />\nconcert series offers classical music<br />\nat extremely reasonable rates<br />\n(51.50 student admission) and is<br />\nopen to the community as well.<br />\nThe 'concert series has a board<br />\ncomposed of faculty. community<br />\nmembers and students who decide<br />\non the performers to be engaged<br />\nand who decide on the concert<br />\nseries' policies.

(Note:<br />\nMrs. Fineberg's office is moving<br />\nshortly to Shriver Hall). These are<br />\ninternational performers from all<br />\nover the world and all are<br />\ngenuinely worth seeing\u2014especially<br />\nwith the ticket prices what they<br />\nare. The concert series was just<br />\ndonated a beautiful new Steinway<br />\nfrom Germany, which is saving<br />\nthem a rental fee of S300 for every<br />\nconcert demanding a piano, and<br />\nthis is but one of the many<br />\ngenerous gifts which helps keep the<br />\nticket prices down.<br />\nJust as important as the \"big<br />\nname\" concerts at Hopkins are all<br />\nof the smaller happenings. There is<br />\nquite a bit of student participation<br />\nin the various performances on<br />\ncampus. Starting tonight at the<br />\nRathskeller is the \"open mike\".<br />\nThis is an S.A.C. sponsored event<br />\nwhich is being headed up by Mitch<br />\nClarvit. The \"open mike\" is<br />\nanybody's opportunity to express<br />\nthemselves in whatever manner<br />\nthey choose, be it singing. playing<br />\ninstruments, dancing, telling jokes<br />\nor doing a cook show. Quite a few<br />\npeople have already gotten in<br />\ntouch with the S.A.C. to express<br />\nan interest in contributing. If you<br />\nhaven't gotten in touch with the<br />\n\"open mike\" organizers and would<br />\nlike to participate,just come to the<br />\n\"open mike\" at the Rathskeller<br />\nany Tuesday night and strut your<br />\nstuff.<br />\nShell Out<br />\nAnd that's not all that's being<br />\nplanned for the Union. The formal<br />\ndedication will be held sometime<br />\nin October and will be a gala<br />\nweekend of music. food, a play (or<br />\nplays). and many surprises as well.<br />\nIn addition, the possibility of a<br />\nfine sound system for the Union is<br />\nbeing kicked around. Some S.A.C.<br />\nmembers are investigating<br />\nequipment and prices. and some<br />\nothers are trying to finagle ways of<br />\ngetting the necessary funds. The<br />\nstudent council might be<br />\nconvinced' to shell out the dough<br />\n(in the S3000 range) if it can be<br />\nshown that the purchasing of the<br />\nsystem would save money in other<br />\nrespects. Says Alan Sapakie. \"if the<br />\nsystem were one that would be<br />\nsuitable for outdoor use as well as<br />\nindoor, then we would save money<br />\nby nor having to \u2022send for Flight<br />\nThree Sound to come down and<br /><br />\nset up.\" Hopefully reasoning like<br />\nthat may convince the S.C. of the<br />\nnecessity of a good sound system.<br />\nWe can also look forward to the<br />\nclass- and fraternity contributions<br />\nto the entertainment situation. The<br />\nclasses didn't seem too lively when<br />\nit came to partying last<br />\nyear\u2014maybe this year they'll roll<br />\nover and rally a bit.

The local bands encountered<br />\nso far generally haven't been very<br />\ngood, but Baltimore is-a big town<br />\nand some good bands will<br />\nundoubtedly turn up.<br />\nAll in all, it looks promising<br />\naround here.

These are<br />\nthe nearly three million American<br />\nmigrant farm workers, twenty five<br />\npercent of whom are children.
