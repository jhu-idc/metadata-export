Over the years,<br />\nit has taken on new<br />\nresponsibilities as other bodies<br />\nhave dwindled in influence or<br />\ndisappeared.<br />\nThis powerful 12-member<br />\ngroup of prestigious senior<br />\nfaculty members considers its<br />\nmain concerns to be the formal<br />\nones of faculty promotion and<br />\nhiring, as well as the quality of<br />\nacademic programs. Although<br />\ntechnically only an advisory<br />\ngroup, it exerts direct power<br />\nover a variety of academic and<br />\nnon-academic matters. But the<br />\nCouncil members contend that<br />\nthey reluctantly handle<br />\nnon-academic matters.<br />\nOther faculty members,<br />\nhowever, attack the Academic<br />\nCouncil for its secrecy, lack of<br />\n<br />\njunior faculty representation and<br />\nalleged isolation from the rest of<br />\nthe academic community.<br />\nTen of the 12 Academic<br />\nCouncil members are nominated<br />\nfor five-year terms by the junior<br />\nand senior faculty members, and<br />\nofficially appointed by the<br />\nPresident. The other two are<br />\nappointed by the rest of the<br />\nmembers for one-year terms.<br />\nThe chairman is the University<br />\nPresident, and other top<br />\nadministrators hold non-voting<br />\nposts.<br />\nThe Council's present<br />\nauthority is great, due both to<br />\nthe prestige of its members and<br />\nthe absence<br />\nof alternative<br />\ninfluential groups.<br />\n\"Before Eisenhower took over<br />\nin 1956, the Council wasn't<br />\nreally consulted,\" noted M.<br />\nGordon Wolman of Geography<br />\nand Environmental Engineering.<br />\nJames Deese, Psychology, added,<br />\n\"Administrations tended to<br />\n<br />\nhandle problems on their own.\"<br />\nThe demise or weakening of<br />\nthree key faculty bodies in the<br />\n1960's greatly added to the<br />\nAcademic Council's influence<br />\nand responsibilities. The<br />\ncurriculum, for example, was<br />\nhandled by an academic group<br />\nwhich faded into oblivion by the<br />\nend of the decade, and that<br />\nresponsibility was shifted over to<br />\nthe Academic Council. The<br />\nmerging of the two Homewood<br />\nfaculties in 1966, the Faculty of<br />\nPhilosophy and the Faculty of<br />\nthe School of Engineering, also<br />\ngreatly strengthened the AC,<br />\nwhich had been the advisory<br />\nboard only for the Faculty of<br />\nPhilosophy.

Action at Monday's meeting, which<br />\ncurtails all cooperation between the Sc and the<br />\nadministration until the resolution of the governance issue,<br />\nhas once and for all established governance reform as the<br />\nprime target of undergraduate (and hopefully Student<br />\nCouncil) action.<br />\nWhat the Council's move means, in effect, is<br />\nthat they will continue to deal with the administration in<br />\nan effort to determine the direction the new governance<br />\nsystem will take, but they will not cooperate in any other<br />\narea. This will hardly cripple the Homewood<br />\nadministration, but it may well serve to make the<br />\nseriousness of the undergraduate demands known to those<br />\nin power.<br />\nNot only did the Council illustrate that governance is<br />\nthe key issue for undergraduates, they have sketched the<br />\noutline which that system utmost take. The over-riding<br />\ndemand is that students be given a policy-making power.<br />\nUndergraduates will no longer be content to serve a merely<br />\nadvisory function. The SC demands, as students must, that<br />\nthe new governing body have a definitive voice in<br />\ndetermining departmental course loads, class scheduling,<br />\ncourse validity, and faculty tenure and advancement<br />\nprocedures. These are the basics; students must first<br />\ndefine, then demand the coming system.<br />\nUnity among undergraduates, in stating their demands<br />\nand following them up with real action, will prove to be<br />\nthe crucial factor in the coming confrontation. The<br />\nadministration is committed to the idea of undergraduates<br />\nas nothing more than advisors in the running of the<br />\nUniversity. They will not change that commitment<br />\nwithout considerable pressure from students..<br />\nThe Student Council has taken the first major action on<br />\nbehalf of governance reform this year, but it is no more<br />\nthan that. The Council has taken first steps before, only to<br />\nstumble long before reaching their goal.<br />\nOne of the first ways undergraduates can show support<br />\nfor the Council's action (and the demand for a University.<br />\ngovernment which reflects our position here) is to turn the<br />\nupcoming Youngbloods concert into a success. The<br />\nCouncil is running the concert completely without<br />\nadministration assistance, and it important that students<br />\nshow that they will support a student-run affair. Failure to<br />\ndo so will only weaken student demands, and strenghten<br />\nthe hand of the administration.<br />\n<br />\nNEWS\u2014LETTER<br />\n<br />\nNov. 2, 1971<br />\n<br />\nLetters to<br />\nthe Editors<br />\n<br />\nThe Year The Yankees Lost The Pennant<br />\n<br />\nTo theEditors:<br />\nThis letter is in response to<br />\n<br />\nyour editorial \"Architect<br />\nUnion\" of October 22, 1971. I<br />\nwish to correct what I believe to<br />\nbe an inaccurate and misleading<br />\nseries of statements. Contrary to<br />\nthe News\u2014Letter editorial. I<br />\nbelieve that organizations had<br />\nfull input into the Planning<br />\nCommittee. Indeed, eight<br />\nsessions, not tile reported one,<br />\nwere devoted to organization's<br />\ninput.<br />\nAll activities were specifically<br />\ninvited to a session of the<br />\nCommittee. At the One meeting<br />\nI attended, there we re<br />\nrepresentatives of the Student<br />\nCouncil, the Debate Council.<br />\nand a few other activities, as well<br />\nas the Course Guide. The<br />\nmeeting was totally devoted to<br />\nseeking out organizational input<br />\nin all intelligent and responsive<br />\nway. The Student Council was<br />\ngiven more than an hour to<br />\npresent its case, and the<br />\ndiscussion was only terminated<br />\nwhen there was agreement<br />\nbetween the committee and the<br />\nSC that nothing more remained<br />\nto be discussed.<br />\nBeing the Course Guide's<br />\nrepresentative, I can say that tile<br />\n<br />\nCourse Guide received all due<br />\nattention. Useful questions were<br />\nraised by the committee, and I<br />\nwas given full time to defend my<br />\nviews and requests.<br />\nIn my view, it is counterproductive to publish inaccurate<br />\nreports and editorials such as the<br />\none in question. There are<br />\nperhaps defects in the Planning<br />\n<br />\nStudent Council<br />\n<br />\nCommittee, but it only<br />\nundermines the prestige and<br />\nintegrity of the News\u2014Letter<br />\n(not to mention the credibility<br />\nof more responsible criticism) to<br />\npublish anything but fact and<br />\nanalysis based on fact.<br />\n<br />\nGreg Dubs<br />\n4<br />\n<br />\nLaughing Matter<br />\n-!Andrew Savitz<br />\nLast week's Pews-Letter had an article imm this<br />\nspot entitled \"No Truth\" written by John C.<br />\nCrisp, a \"member in good standing of the<br />\nStudent Council.\" After reading time article I was<br />\nsure that the description \"no truth\" applied to<br />\nthe article itself rather than to the accusations<br />\nleveled against theStudent Council.To begin with,<br />\nMr. Crisp states that the reason these accusations<br />\nare erroneous is that \"no one KNOWS enough<br />\nabout the Council to make serious chargessuchas<br />\nthese, or for that matter any charges at all.\"<br />\nWell Mr. Crisp, as a \"member in good standing<br />\nof the Student Council\" myself, I charge the<br />\nStudent Council with being \"a joke, a laughing<br />\nstock, and an impediment to student progress.''<br />\nTo prove that the Student Council is active.<br />\nMr. Crisp cites Red China Day. Sha-na-na and the<br />\nreferendum on the Student Activity Fee as things<br />\nthat the Council has done.<br />\nLet me point out that the only thing the<br />\nCouncil did on these things was to give financial<br />\nsupport period. Rich Pfeffer ran China Day, Jim<br />\nPhelps ran Sha-na-na singlehandedly, and the<br />\nonly Council Member to do any actual work<br />\ndirectly was Bob Bellflower who ran the<br />\nreferendum (which was a total bust). So don't<br />\ntry to infer that the Council did anything more<br />\nstrenuous or time consuming than voting for<br />\nthese activities. In terms of genuine activity the<br />\ncouncil has done zero this year.<br />\nMr. Crisp, you say that the Council has been<br />\nworking \"very hard on a new Student Council<br />\nConstitution\" but that simply isn't so. Discussion<br />\nof the Constitution has been tabled for five<br />\nmeetings in a row. The chairman of the<br />\ncommittee has been changed either two or three<br />\ntimes and in fact, nothing has been done or<br />\nreported to the council.<br />\nA statement of yours in the article frankly<br />\namazed me. You said that the reason for last<br />\nweeks walkout \"was out of disgust that a couple<br />\nof the council members\u2014Freshmen I might<br />\nadd\u2014found it quite impossible to conduct<br />\n<br />\nAndrew Savitz is president of the freshman class.<br />\n<br />\nthemselves in a mature manner.\" Mr. Crisp, have<br />\nyou talked to the other members who walked<br />\nout of the meeting? Obviously not, because of<br />\nthe four members who walked out (Al Dimiero,<br />\nShep Hoffman you and myself) both Al and<br />\nShep say that \"immature freshmen\" had<br />\nabsolutely nothing to do with it, and since I am a<br />\nFreshman I obviously left for other reasons. So<br />\nMr. Crisp, you were the only one who walked<br />\nout for that reason. In the future I suggest that<br />\nyou refrain from stating the purpose of other<br />\nmembers'actions.<br />\nThe most blatant error in your article Mr.<br />\nCrisp is your statement that \"there is no<br />\ndissension in the Council.\" What right do you<br />\nhave to speak for the Council? Did you ask<br />\nanyone if there was any dissension'? You<br />\ncertainly didn't ask me. Last night the<br />\nVice-President of the Council resigned. I know of<br />\nat least two more members who are thinking of<br />\nquitting. If this isn't dissension, what is it? Team<br />\nSpirit'?<br />\nFinally, you put the blame on the students for<br />\nshowing apathy and for not finding out \"what's<br />\nhappening on the Council.\" Can you really blame<br />\nthe students for not showing up? They feel that<br />\nthe Council is a do-nothing organization and the<br />\nCouncil just reinforces this idea by doing<br />\nnothing. Why should the students take an<br />\ninterest? What has the Council done to interest<br />\nthem?<br />\nI guess it all boils down to what you feel the<br />\npurpose of the Council should be. I feel that it is<br />\nthe responsibility of the Student Council to<br />\npromote enthusiasm on campus. It is the<br />\nCouncil's job to give the students something to<br />\nget involved with, something to be interested in.<br />\nWhy should students come to the Council's<br />\nmeetings when the high point of the agenda is a<br />\ndiscussion of the parlimentarian<br />\nWhen the Council gives the students a reason<br />\nto come to meetings then the students will show<br />\nup. Give them an issue worth involvement and<br />\nthey will get involved. But chastise them for not<br />\ncoming to Council meetings and you'll lose them<br />\naltogether.<br />\nThe task of \"dissolving the traditional apathy\"<br />\non campus is our job...not theirs.<br />\n<br />\nA<br />\n<br />\n\fNov. 2, 1971<br />\n<br />\nNEWS\u2014LETTER<br />\n<br />\nPAGE 7<br />\n<br />\nduane allman<br />\nBy MICHAEL HILL<br />\nWith the group, he stood quietly, unobtrusively playing the licks that made<br />\nhim one of the greatest guitarists alive.<br />\nWith his shaggy hair, drooping moustache and down-home grin he seemed<br />\nout of place challenging Clapton on the<br />\nBritisher's own album.

Duane Allman was playing<br />\nback-up to more and more stars, and<br />\nmost people complained that he wasn't<br />\nmixed in loudly enough on Eric Clapton's first solo offering.

One Hopkins kick was<br />\nroutinely saved by Loyola's<br />\ngoalie, another try by Scott<br />\nTyner at center forward<br />\nnarrowly missed .the mark,<br />\nhitting the bar atop the goal and<br />\nbounding back onto the field.<br />\nTrying<br />\nCoach Bob Oliver's footmen,<br />\nnow 5-4 on the season, will seek<br />\nto stay above the .500 mark<br />\nnext Saturday when they travel<br />\nto Maryland's eastern shore to<br />\nface Washington College.<br />\n<br />\nRick Kowalchuk helps Jack Thomas make one of his 19 completions.<br />\n<br />\nCross-Country Team<br />\nBows To Towson St.<br />\nBy ED BRETHAUER<br />\nLast Saturday afternoon the<br />\nBlue Jay runners were foiled in<br />\ntheir attempt to inflict another<br />\nloss on Towson (in addition to<br />\nthe football game), as Hopkins<br />\nbowed to the Tigers in<br />\ncross-country, 22-38.<br />\nThe loss came as a severe blow<br />\nto Hopkins' cross-country fans,<br />\nwho were hoping to see the team<br />\nnotch a winning record this<br />\nseason, after last .year's<br />\ndisappointing 0-11 finish. The<br />\npossibility of doing this still<br />\nremains, but unfourtnately, it is<br />\nvery slim.

But, as has been said<br />\nbefore, one man does not a meet<br />\nwin.<br />\nPlacing<br />\nThe next Hopkins' runner to<br />\nplace was freshman, Jeff Greve,<br />\nwho took fifth with a time of<br />\n25:47.

Over the years,<br />\nit has taken on new<br />\nresponsibilities as other bodies<br />\nhave dwindled in influence or<br />\ndisappeared.<br />\nThis powerful 12-member<br />\ngroup of prestigious senior<br />\nfaculty members considers its<br />\nmain concerns to be the formal<br />\nones of faculty promotion and<br />\nhiring, as well as the quality of<br />\nacademic programs. Although<br />\ntechnically only an advisory<br />\ngroup, it exerts direct power<br />\nover a variety of academic and<br />\nnon-academic matters. But the<br />\nCouncil members contend that<br />\nthey reluctantly handle<br />\nnon-academic matters.<br />\nOther faculty members,<br />\nhowever, attack the Academic<br />\nCouncil for its secrecy, lack of<br /><br />\njunior faculty representation and<br />\nalleged isolation from the rest of<br />\nthe academic community.<br />\nTen of the 12 Academic<br />\nCouncil members are nominated<br />\nfor five-year terms by the junior<br />\nand senior faculty members, and<br />\nofficially appointed by the<br />\nPresident. The other two are<br />\nappointed by the rest of the<br />\nmembers for one-year terms.<br />\nThe chairman is the University<br />\nPresident, and other top<br />\nadministrators hold non-voting<br />\nposts.<br />\nThe Council's present<br />\nauthority is great, due both to<br />\nthe prestige of its members and<br />\nthe absence<br />\nof alternative<br />\ninfluential groups.<br />\n\"Before Eisenhower took over<br />\nin 1956, the Council wasn't<br />\nreally consulted,\" noted M.<br />\nGordon Wolman of Geography<br />\nand Environmental Engineering.<br />\nJames Deese, Psychology, added,<br />\n\"Administrations tended to<br /><br />\nhandle problems on their own.\"<br />\nThe demise or weakening of<br />\nthree key faculty bodies in the<br />\n1960's greatly added to the<br />\nAcademic Council's influence<br />\nand responsibilities. The<br />\ncurriculum, for example, was<br />\nhandled by an academic group<br />\nwhich faded into oblivion by the<br />\nend of the decade, and that<br />\nresponsibility was shifted over to<br />\nthe Academic Council. The<br />\nmerging of the two Homewood<br />\nfaculties in 1966, the Faculty of<br />\nPhilosophy and the Faculty of<br />\nthe School of Engineering, also<br />\ngreatly strengthened the AC,<br />\nwhich had been the advisory<br />\nboard only for the Faculty of<br />\nPhilosophy.

Action at Monday's meeting, which<br />\ncurtails all cooperation between the Sc and the<br />\nadministration until the resolution of the governance issue,<br />\nhas once and for all established governance reform as the<br />\nprime target of undergraduate (and hopefully Student<br />\nCouncil) action.<br />\nWhat the Council's move means, in effect, is<br />\nthat they will continue to deal with the administration in<br />\nan effort to determine the direction the new governance<br />\nsystem will take, but they will not cooperate in any other<br />\narea. This will hardly cripple the Homewood<br />\nadministration, but it may well serve to make the<br />\nseriousness of the undergraduate demands known to those<br />\nin power.<br />\nNot only did the Council illustrate that governance is<br />\nthe key issue for undergraduates, they have sketched the<br />\noutline which that system utmost take. The over-riding<br />\ndemand is that students be given a policy-making power.<br />\nUndergraduates will no longer be content to serve a merely<br />\nadvisory function. The SC demands, as students must, that<br />\nthe new governing body have a definitive voice in<br />\ndetermining departmental course loads, class scheduling,<br />\ncourse validity, and faculty tenure and advancement<br />\nprocedures. These are the basics; students must first<br />\ndefine, then demand the coming system.<br />\nUnity among undergraduates, in stating their demands<br />\nand following them up with real action, will prove to be<br />\nthe crucial factor in the coming confrontation. The<br />\nadministration is committed to the idea of undergraduates<br />\nas nothing more than advisors in the running of the<br />\nUniversity. They will not change that commitment<br />\nwithout considerable pressure from students..<br />\nThe Student Council has taken the first major action on<br />\nbehalf of governance reform this year, but it is no more<br />\nthan that. The Council has taken first steps before, only to<br />\nstumble long before reaching their goal.<br />\nOne of the first ways undergraduates can show support<br />\nfor the Council's action (and the demand for a University.<br />\ngovernment which reflects our position here) is to turn the<br />\nupcoming Youngbloods concert into a success. The<br />\nCouncil is running the concert completely without<br />\nadministration assistance, and it important that students<br />\nshow that they will support a student-run affair. Failure to<br />\ndo so will only weaken student demands, and strenghten<br />\nthe hand of the administration.<br /><br />\nNEWS\u2014LETTER<br /><br />\nNov. 2, 1971<br /><br />\nLetters to<br />\nthe Editors<br /><br />\nThe Year The Yankees Lost The Pennant<br /><br />\nTo theEditors:<br />\nThis letter is in response to<br /><br />\nyour editorial \"Architect<br />\nUnion\" of October 22, 1971. I<br />\nwish to correct what I believe to<br />\nbe an inaccurate and misleading<br />\nseries of statements. Contrary to<br />\nthe News\u2014Letter editorial. I<br />\nbelieve that organizations had<br />\nfull input into the Planning<br />\nCommittee. Indeed, eight<br />\nsessions, not tile reported one,<br />\nwere devoted to organization's<br />\ninput.<br />\nAll activities were specifically<br />\ninvited to a session of the<br />\nCommittee. At the One meeting<br />\nI attended, there we re<br />\nrepresentatives of the Student<br />\nCouncil, the Debate Council.<br />\nand a few other activities, as well<br />\nas the Course Guide. The<br />\nmeeting was totally devoted to<br />\nseeking out organizational input<br />\nin all intelligent and responsive<br />\nway. The Student Council was<br />\ngiven more than an hour to<br />\npresent its case, and the<br />\ndiscussion was only terminated<br />\nwhen there was agreement<br />\nbetween the committee and the<br />\nSC that nothing more remained<br />\nto be discussed.<br />\nBeing the Course Guide's<br />\nrepresentative, I can say that tile<br /><br />\nCourse Guide received all due<br />\nattention. Useful questions were<br />\nraised by the committee, and I<br />\nwas given full time to defend my<br />\nviews and requests.<br />\nIn my view, it is counterproductive to publish inaccurate<br />\nreports and editorials such as the<br />\none in question. There are<br />\nperhaps defects in the Planning<br /><br />\nStudent Council<br /><br />\nCommittee, but it only<br />\nundermines the prestige and<br />\nintegrity of the News\u2014Letter<br />\n(not to mention the credibility<br />\nof more responsible criticism) to<br />\npublish anything but fact and<br />\nanalysis based on fact.<br /><br />\nGreg Dubs<br />\n4<br /><br />\nLaughing Matter<br />\n-!Andrew Savitz<br />\nLast week's Pews-Letter had an article imm this<br />\nspot entitled \"No Truth\" written by John C.<br />\nCrisp, a \"member in good standing of the<br />\nStudent Council.\" After reading time article I was<br />\nsure that the description \"no truth\" applied to<br />\nthe article itself rather than to the accusations<br />\nleveled against theStudent Council.To begin with,<br />\nMr. Crisp states that the reason these accusations<br />\nare erroneous is that \"no one KNOWS enough<br />\nabout the Council to make serious chargessuchas<br />\nthese, or for that matter any charges at all.\"<br />\nWell Mr. Crisp, as a \"member in good standing<br />\nof the Student Council\" myself, I charge the<br />\nStudent Council with being \"a joke, a laughing<br />\nstock, and an impediment to student progress.''<br />\nTo prove that the Student Council is active.<br />\nMr. Crisp cites Red China Day. Sha-na-na and the<br />\nreferendum on the Student Activity Fee as things<br />\nthat the Council has done.<br />\nLet me point out that the only thing the<br />\nCouncil did on these things was to give financial<br />\nsupport period. Rich Pfeffer ran China Day, Jim<br />\nPhelps ran Sha-na-na singlehandedly, and the<br />\nonly Council Member to do any actual work<br />\ndirectly was Bob Bellflower who ran the<br />\nreferendum (which was a total bust). So don't<br />\ntry to infer that the Council did anything more<br />\nstrenuous or time consuming than voting for<br />\nthese activities. In terms of genuine activity the<br />\ncouncil has done zero this year.<br />\nMr. Crisp, you say that the Council has been<br />\nworking \"very hard on a new Student Council<br />\nConstitution\" but that simply isn't so. Discussion<br />\nof the Constitution has been tabled for five<br />\nmeetings in a row. The chairman of the<br />\ncommittee has been changed either two or three<br />\ntimes and in fact, nothing has been done or<br />\nreported to the council.<br />\nA statement of yours in the article frankly<br />\namazed me. You said that the reason for last<br />\nweeks walkout \"was out of disgust that a couple<br />\nof the council members\u2014Freshmen I might<br />\nadd\u2014found it quite impossible to conduct<br /><br />\nAndrew Savitz is president of the freshman class.<br /><br />\nthemselves in a mature manner.\" Mr. Crisp, have<br />\nyou talked to the other members who walked<br />\nout of the meeting? Obviously not, because of<br />\nthe four members who walked out (Al Dimiero,<br />\nShep Hoffman you and myself) both Al and<br />\nShep say that \"immature freshmen\" had<br />\nabsolutely nothing to do with it, and since I am a<br />\nFreshman I obviously left for other reasons. So<br />\nMr. Crisp, you were the only one who walked<br />\nout for that reason. In the future I suggest that<br />\nyou refrain from stating the purpose of other<br />\nmembers'actions.<br />\nThe most blatant error in your article Mr.<br />\nCrisp is your statement that \"there is no<br />\ndissension in the Council.\" What right do you<br />\nhave to speak for the Council? Did you ask<br />\nanyone if there was any dissension'? You<br />\ncertainly didn't ask me. Last night the<br />\nVice-President of the Council resigned. I know of<br />\nat least two more members who are thinking of<br />\nquitting. If this isn't dissension, what is it? Team<br />\nSpirit'?<br />\nFinally, you put the blame on the students for<br />\nshowing apathy and for not finding out \"what's<br />\nhappening on the Council.\" Can you really blame<br />\nthe students for not showing up? They feel that<br />\nthe Council is a do-nothing organization and the<br />\nCouncil just reinforces this idea by doing<br />\nnothing. Why should the students take an<br />\ninterest? What has the Council done to interest<br />\nthem?<br />\nI guess it all boils down to what you feel the<br />\npurpose of the Council should be. I feel that it is<br />\nthe responsibility of the Student Council to<br />\npromote enthusiasm on campus. It is the<br />\nCouncil's job to give the students something to<br />\nget involved with, something to be interested in.<br />\nWhy should students come to the Council's<br />\nmeetings when the high point of the agenda is a<br />\ndiscussion of the parlimentarian<br />\nWhen the Council gives the students a reason<br />\nto come to meetings then the students will show<br />\nup. Give them an issue worth involvement and<br />\nthey will get involved. But chastise them for not<br />\ncoming to Council meetings and you'll lose them<br />\naltogether.<br />\nThe task of \"dissolving the traditional apathy\"<br />\non campus is our job...not theirs.<br /><br />\nA<br /><br />\nNov. 2, 1971<br /><br />\nNEWS\u2014LETTER<br /><br />\nPAGE 7<br /><br />\nduane allman<br />\nBy MICHAEL HILL<br />\nWith the group, he stood quietly, unobtrusively playing the licks that made<br />\nhim one of the greatest guitarists alive.<br />\nWith his shaggy hair, drooping moustache and down-home grin he seemed<br />\nout of place challenging Clapton on the<br />\nBritisher's own album.

Bench<br />\nswings and softball fields are still the order of the day. Nevertheless, Piedmont<br />\nPark was one of the last holdouts of<br />\nHaight-Ashbury vibes in the country.<br />\nThe Pavillion wasn't really a stage, but<br />\npeople would flock from all over Atlanta to join those from the nearby hip<br />\ncommunity, cramming their bodies together on the bare, dusty ground in<br />\nfront of this makeshift stage and filling<br />\nthe grassy slope next to the tennis<br />\ncourts, to listen and perhaps to dance to<br />\nthe weekly free music.<br />\nThe Grateful Dead, Mountain, Brewer<br />\nand Shipley, Chicago, It's a Beautiful<br />\nDay, The Hampton Grease Band are<br />\nsome of the groups that have played<br />\nthere. But probably none of the performances were more important than those<br />\ngiven by the Allman Brothers.<br />\nComing from Macon, 90 miles down<br />\nthe road, they got their start in front of<br />\nPiedmont's highly critical yet appreciative audiences. Two lead guitars, two<br />\ndrummers, organ and bass. The sound<br />\nwas light, blues in the best tradition, yet<br />\nsomehow capturing the spontaneous element in a structured framework.

Duane was obviously the driving<br />\nforce behind the group, giving it the<br />\nspontaneous genius that separated it<br />\nfrom ever-growing mass of mediocre<br />\nsounds. Without him, the band will<br />\nsound empty, a shell of its previous self,<br />\nand there seems little doubt that it can't<br />\ncontinue.<br />\nBeing a hit in Piedmont Park was enough and the group quickly moved onto<br />\ntheir first album and a.few tours. Their<br />\ninitial recording, though not capturing<br />\ntheir live sound, was a beautiful creation<br />\nnonetheless. It presented now classic examples of the blues/rockjazz sound they<br />\ncould produce. Tight and together yet<br />\nsomehow always Moving. Duane was of<br />\ncourse the star, but it was disappointing<br />\nthat he didn't play more slide guitar.<br />\nTheir second album, Idlewild South,<br />\nwas different from the First. It was<br />\nabove all ,a nice album , one that made<br />\nyou happy when you listened to it. It<br />\ncontained the same moving togetherness<br />\nof the first album, a relationship expressed by the title of the album, but it<br />\nwas in something of a lower key.<br />\nAround this time, the group began to<br />\nmove. Duane Allman was playing<br />\nback-up to more and more stars, and<br />\nmost people complained that he wasn't<br />\nmixed in loudly enough on Eric Clapton's first solo offering. Dates around<br />\nthe country picked up with a steady<br />\nclimb in billing.<br />\nAt the second Atlanta Pop Festival,<br />\nheld in Macon, Johnny Winter came out<br />\nto jam with them at 3 in the morning<br />\nand in some of the most incredible electric blues ever played, Duane showed<br />\nWinter up, doing beautiful slide work on<br />\n\"Stormy Monday.\"<br />\nBill Graham recognized their talent<br />\nearly and booked them into the Fillmore East. Here again there was a<br />\nsteady climb in billing, culminated by<br />\nan invitation to headline the closing<br />\nnight last June. \"I'd like to introduce<br />\none of the most incredible, talented<br />\nrock groups _I've ever heard,\" Graham<br />\nsaid as they went on.

The Blue Jays<br />\ncombined a strong defensive<br />\neffort with several key heads-up<br />\nplays on offense to avenge last<br />\nyear's 33-6 Tiger victory in this<br />\nsecond meeting ever between the<br />\ntwo schools.<br />\nThe Blue Jays opened the<br />\ngame in seemingly lackluster<br />\nfashion. The Towson defense<br />\nkept Hopkins effectively bottled<br />\nup, and finally forced the<br /><br />\ninevitable breakthrough early in<br />\nthe second period. Gary Gist<br />\nreturned a Jack Thomas punt 33<br />\nyards to the Blue fay 16 to set<br />\nup a 4-yard scoring run by<br />\nhalfback George Cadorette. The<br />\nconversion by John Glass gave<br />\nthe Tigers a 7-0 edge with<br />\napproximately 11 minutes<br />\nremairine in the first half.<br />\nThe Blue Jays didn't put<br />\ntogether a sustained drive until<br />\nthe middle of the quarter, when<br />\nHopkins drove in for the<br />\napparent tying touchdown.<br />\nUnfortunately for the Jays, four<br />\nstraight cracks at the goal by<br />\nhalfback Butch Robey from<br />\ninside the 4 proved fruitless,<br />\nHopkins surrendering possession.<br />\nThe Hopkins defensive unit,<br />\nhowever, refused to roll over and<br /><br />\nNEWS-LETTER<br /><br />\nSPORTS<br /><br />\nforced a crucial break. On third<br />\nand ten from the one-foot line,<br />\nfullback Richard Young was<br />\ncaught in his end zone by<br />\nGunter Glocker and Craig<br />\nStevens for a safety. Four plays<br />\nfollowing the ensuing free kick,<br />\nThomas found Nolan behind<br />\ntwo defenders for the go-ahead<br />\nscore. Thomas' point after<br />\nupped the halftime score to 9-7.<br />\nThe Blue Jays took a<br />\ncommanding 23-7 edge in the<br />\nthird period. Butch Robey<br />\ncapped a 68-yard scoring march<br />\nwith a three yard run on<br />\nHopkins' first series of downs,<br />\nand Nolan broke his punt return<br />\nseveral minutes later. The Tigers<br />\npulled to 23-15 on a 20 yard<br />\naerial from Bobby Roche to Bob<br />\nRemeto, but three key Blue Jay<br />\nplays staved off the comeback.<br />\nThomas raced for a badly<br />\nneeded first down from punt<br />\nformation when lie alertly<br />\nobserved that the Tigers were<br />\nrushing nary a soul.<br /><br />\nHopkins Footmen Stung<br />\nBy BRUCE BORTZ<br />\nLoyola's undefeated soccer<br />\nmachine combined a steady<br />\noffense with a stingy defense<br />\nSaturday in shutting out<br />\nHopkins 4-0.<br />\nAn uncommonly large<br />\nHomewood crowd looking on in<br />\nsunny, seventyish comfort saw<br />\nthe visiting Greyhounds score<br />\nsingle goals in each quarter. The<br />\nremark of a reserve Hoppie<br />\namply summed up the somewhat<br />\nlopsided outcome: \"They're a<br />\nheckuva better team that we<br />\nare.\"<br />\nLoyola's aggressive corps of<br />\nforwards spent most of the first<br />\nquarter within scoring range. It<br />\nwould have scored more than<br />\nthe one goal it came away with<br />\nin the first minutes of the game<br />\nhad it not been for numerous<br />\nspectacular saves by Jay goalie<br />\nKeith Naunheim and by timely<br />\ndefense by the Jays' three<br />\nfullbacks.<br />\nThe Jay offense stemmed this<br />\nonslaght somewhat in the second<br />\nquarter. Though they managed<br />\nto keep the ball in Loyola's<br />\ndefensive backyard during much<br />\nof this period, the Jays never<br />\nreally came close to scoring.<br />\nMeanwhile, the Greyhounds<br /><br />\nwere able to convert their<br />\ninfrequent offensive chances<br />\ninto a goal:thus fashioning a 2-0<br />\nlead. This score came when a<br />\nLoyola forward stopped a<br />\nteam-mate's lead pass down the<br />\ncenter lane, turned round, and<br />\ndrilled a kick into the empty<br />\nright corner of the Hopkins'<br />\nnets.<br />\nWhile Loyola's green and<br />\nwhite 'clad booters were adding<br />\ngoals three and .four, the Jays<br />\ntried but failed to avert a<br /><br />\nshutout. One Hopkins kick was<br />\nroutinely saved by Loyola's<br />\ngoalie, another try by Scott<br />\nTyner at center forward<br />\nnarrowly missed .the mark,<br />\nhitting the bar atop the goal and<br />\nbounding back onto the field.<br />\nTrying<br />\nCoach Bob Oliver's footmen,<br />\nnow 5-4 on the season, will seek<br />\nto stay above the .500 mark<br />\nnext Saturday when they travel<br />\nto Maryland's eastern shore to<br />\nface Washington College.<br /><br />\nRick Kowalchuk helps Jack Thomas make one of his 19 completions.<br /><br />\nCross-Country Team<br />\nBows To Towson St.<br />\nBy ED BRETHAUER<br />\nLast Saturday afternoon the<br />\nBlue Jay runners were foiled in<br />\ntheir attempt to inflict another<br />\nloss on Towson (in addition to<br />\nthe football game), as Hopkins<br />\nbowed to the Tigers in<br />\ncross-country, 22-38.<br />\nThe loss came as a severe blow<br />\nto Hopkins' cross-country fans,<br />\nwho were hoping to see the team<br />\nnotch a winning record this<br />\nseason, after last .year's<br />\ndisappointing 0-11 finish. The<br />\npossibility of doing this still<br />\nremains, but unfourtnately, it is<br />\nvery slim. In order to perform<br />\nthis feat, the team must still beat<br />\nSwarthmore, the defending<br />\nchampions of the Middle<br />\nAt<br />\nConference, and an<br />\nequally solid Western Maryland<br />\nteam.<br />\nThe only good part about last<br />\nSaturday's meet for \u2022 Blue Jay<br /><br />\nfans was the performance of<br />\nRuss Dubiel, who once again<br />\ntook first place with a time of<br />\n24:44. But, as has been said<br />\nbefore, one man does not a meet<br />\nwin.<br />\nPlacing<br />\nThe next Hopkins' runner to<br />\nplace was freshman, Jeff Greve,<br />\nwho took fifth with a time of<br />\n25:47. Jeff was followed by<br />\nfellow freshman, Dave Piccoli,<br />\nwho captured ninth place with a<br />\ntime of 26:55, Ira Luke, who<br />\ntook 11th with a time of 27:15,<br />\nand Bill Schickler, who finished<br />\ntwelfth in 27:35.<br />\nAs can be seen by looking at<br />\nthese times, there was a three<br />\nminute span between the first<br />\nand last Hopkins' runners, as<br />\n/<br />\n2<br />\ncontrasted with only a 11<br />\nminute span for Towson<br />\nrunners.
