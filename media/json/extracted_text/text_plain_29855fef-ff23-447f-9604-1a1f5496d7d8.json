This is what-Captain Jack Fulton will attempt to do<br />\nnext year; and if he has the support and the material which was<br />\navailable last year he will succeed.<br />\nThe schedule for 1911 is the<br />\nhardest by far that any Hopkins<br />\nteam has ever had. Although the<br />\nschedule is not yet completed, it<br />\nhas in it already the names of<br />\nseveral big colleges, such as the<br />\nNavy and University of Virginia.<br />\nThe Navy game will be the first<br />\ngame of the season, October 7, at<br />\nAnnapolis. Accordingly, the team<br />\nwill have to round into shape before the season starts instead of<br />\npostponing practice until the week<br />\nbefore the first game, as heretofore.<br />\nThe second, also, will be played<br />\naway from home,Stevens Institute,<br />\nat Hoboken, on October 14. The<br />\nother two games that have been<br />\nsettled are with the University<br />\nof Virginia, on November i r, and<br />\nwith the Western Maryland College, at ,Hornewood, on Thanksgiving Day. The date of the'game<br />\nwith Carlisle has not yet been fixed.<br />\nCoach Lynn will be back again<br />\nnext year, and he will be able to<br />\nget a good many of the medical<br />\nmen out. The assistant coach is<br />\nuncertain, but Sieber will probably<br />\nbe on the job again. Altogether<br />\nthe prospects for the 1911 football team are such as never were<br />\nbefore and the stands at Homewood ought to be taxed to their<br />\nfull capacity at every game.<br />\n<br />\nSenior<br />\n<br />\nClass Meeting.<br />\n<br />\nAt a meeting of the senior class,<br />\nlast Thursday, several important<br />\nmatters were brought up.

Out of the forty<br />\nor more candidates, Coach Hooper<br />\npicked the eighteen who have done<br />\nthe most promising work so far,<br />\nand he will work with these until<br />\nthe team gets out of doors. As<br />\nsoon as the outdoor practice begins<br />\nall the candidates will be asked to<br />\njoin the squad again, as Manager<br />\nSattler intends to arrange a schedule for one or more strong scrub<br />\nteams. The eighteen players who<br />\nwill practice in the \"cage\"<br />\nare: Peiper Sattler, Howel, Rice,<br />\nHolmes, Fulton,Campbell, McCabe,<br />\nHardy, Sutton, Russell, Wolfe, Disney, Stewart, Dorsey, Hanzsche,<br />\nMeekins, and Carroll. 'Manager<br />\nSattler announced that the home<br />\ngames would be played at Homewood. This is good news for the<br />\nbackers of the baseball team. At<br />\nthe beginning of this year the problem of securing grounds threatened<br />\nto be a serious one. It did not seem<br />\nlikely that the Homewood committee would consent to the laying<br />\noff of a diamond on the Homewood field, especially as it will be<br />\nused so much by the lacrosse team.<br />\nSuch interest was shown in baseball and the fact that no other enclosed grounds were obtainable that<br />\nthe Homewood committee finally<br />\ngave its consent. The big games,<br />\nlike those with Harvard and the<br />\nUniversity of Pennsylvania, should<br />\ndraw large crowds, and this fact,<br />\ncoupled with the Homewood enclosed grounds, should enable the<br />\nnine to have a very successful<br />\nseason financially. The old Country<br />\nSchool grounds, which are part of<br />\nthe Homewood estate, will be used<br />\nfor the daily practice as soon as<br />\nthe squad is able to begin outdoors.<br />\nThe season will probably start<br />\non April 1st, with Eastern College,<br />\nalthough that game has not yet<br />\nbeen definitely determined upon.<br />\nFrom that date on, there will be a<br />\ngame every Saturday until the end<br />\nof May, with the single exception<br />\nof May 6; and Manager Sattler<br />\nhopes to arrange a game with<br />\nLehigh for that date.<br />\nHarvard has established a college course in printing.

The game between<br />\nPerlman and Rosenfeld was a long,<br />\ndrawn-out affair of some fifty<br />\nmoves, during which both players<br />\nmissed several opportunities to<br />\n'mate. The Hammond-Melamet<br />\ngame was by far the most interesting, and the best played. The<br />\ngame continued fairly even for<br />\nabout fifteen moves. Then Melamet began getting a somewhat<br />\nstronger position. Soon, however,<br />\nHammond thought he saw an opportunity for a quick checkmate<br />\nand sacrificed a rook to accomplish his purpose. But he had miscalculated the results of the move<br />\nand, handicapped by the loss of<br />\nhis rook, he was forced to resign<br />\nthe game to Melamet on the twentyfifth move.<br />\nKuehn had somewhat the advantage of Brown when the latter<br />\nhad to leave to catch the train to<br />\nWashington to participate in the<br />\nGeorge Washington games. If<br />\nBrown loses, the match will result<br />\nin a tie, and will probably be played<br />\nover. The match was refereed by<br />\nW. E.

Horrax won first place in<br />\nthe 50-yard hurdles, and second<br />\nin the high jump.

Lee and Reeside<br />\nwere second in the mile and halfmile, respectively, This made a<br />\ntotal of nineteen points, while the<br />\nVirginians, who won the meet,<br />\nrolled up thirty-four points.<br />\nCaptain Fulton and ex-Captain<br />\nStollenwerck were greatly missed<br />\nin the quarter and in the half, and<br />\nwith these two runners in good condition Hopkins would have won the<br />\n-meet. Ray, Dodson, Brown, Zinn,<br />\nand Catlin showed up well in their<br />\nevents, but were not quite fast<br />\nenough to place. They all\u2022showed<br />\nthat they had the makings .of good<br />\nrunners in them, and are certain to<br />\n.be heard from in some of the other<br />\nmeets, before the winter is over.<br />\nAll the rooters who accompanied<br />\nthe Black and Blue team to Washington were thrilled by the strong<br />\nfinish of Lee in the mile. He<br />\ngradually caught up with and<br />\npassed most of the contestants who<br />\nhad received large handicaps, and<br />\nhe worked hard to overtake Boyle<br />\nwho had a 40-yard start on him.<br />\nBoyle kept the lead and finished a<br />\nfew yards ahead of Lee, but if the<br />\nrace had been one lap more the<br />\nresult would almost certainly have<br />\nbeen different.<br />\nHorrax is, without doubt, the star<br />\nathlete of the Hopkins track team.<br />\nIn every meet last year he came<br />\naway with one or more medals in<br />\nspite of being put at scratch in,,<br />\nnearly all the events he was entered'<br />\nin. His versatility is wonderful.<br />\nHe is a crack hurdler, pole vaulter,<br />\nhigh jumper, broad jumper, and<br />\nhop-step-and-jump artist. He demonstrated his sterling ability again<br />\nlast Saturday and showed he is as<br />\ngood, if not better, than last year.<br />\nHe is expected to figure prominently in the joint games to be<br />\nheld by Hopkins and the Fifth<br />\nRegiment Athletic Association this<br />\nSaturday night at the Fifth Regiment Armory.

In addition, there will be<br />\na number of other individual events<br />\nin which the first prizes will be<br />\ngold watches. The prizes are indeed very liberal and it is expected<br />\nthat over two hundred teams will<br />\nbe attracted to the meet.<br /><br />\nGradually through long years of<br />\nhard work the football team has<br />\nworked itself up into a position<br />\nwhere it is able to demand recognition from stronger teams than<br />\nthose of the Maryland colleges. It<br />\nnow remains to be seen whether we<br />\nare worthy of the position and if<br />\nwe can hold it. This is what-Captain Jack Fulton will attempt to do<br />\nnext year; and if he has the support and the material which was<br />\navailable last year he will succeed.<br />\nThe schedule for 1911 is the<br />\nhardest by far that any Hopkins<br />\nteam has ever had.

Out of the forty<br />\nor more candidates, Coach Hooper<br />\npicked the eighteen who have done<br />\nthe most promising work so far,<br />\nand he will work with these until<br />\nthe team gets out of doors. As<br />\nsoon as the outdoor practice begins<br />\nall the candidates will be asked to<br />\njoin the squad again, as Manager<br />\nSattler intends to arrange a schedule for one or more strong scrub<br />\nteams. The eighteen players who<br />\nwill practice in the \"cage\"<br />\nare: Peiper Sattler, Howel, Rice,<br />\nHolmes, Fulton,Campbell, McCabe,<br />\nHardy, Sutton, Russell, Wolfe, Disney, Stewart, Dorsey, Hanzsche,<br />\nMeekins, and Carroll. 'Manager<br />\nSattler announced that the home<br />\ngames would be played at Homewood. This is good news for the<br />\nbackers of the baseball team. At<br />\nthe beginning of this year the problem of securing grounds threatened<br />\nto be a serious one. It did not seem<br />\nlikely that the Homewood committee would consent to the laying<br />\noff of a diamond on the Homewood field, especially as it will be<br />\nused so much by the lacrosse team.<br />\nSuch interest was shown in baseball and the fact that no other enclosed grounds were obtainable that<br />\nthe Homewood committee finally<br />\ngave its consent. The big games,<br />\nlike those with Harvard and the<br />\nUniversity of Pennsylvania, should<br />\ndraw large crowds, and this fact,<br />\ncoupled with the Homewood enclosed grounds, should enable the<br />\nnine to have a very successful<br />\nseason financially. The old Country<br />\nSchool grounds, which are part of<br />\nthe Homewood estate, will be used<br />\nfor the daily practice as soon as<br />\nthe squad is able to begin outdoors.<br />\nThe season will probably start<br />\non April 1st, with Eastern College,<br />\nalthough that game has not yet<br />\nbeen definitely determined upon.<br />\nFrom that date on, there will be a<br />\ngame every Saturday until the end<br />\nof May, with the single exception<br />\nof May 6; and Manager Sattler<br />\nhopes to arrange a game with<br />\nLehigh for that date.<br />\nHarvard has established a college course in printing.

The game between<br />\nPerlman and Rosenfeld was a long,<br />\ndrawn-out affair of some fifty<br />\nmoves, during which both players<br />\nmissed several opportunities to<br />\n'mate. The Hammond-Melamet<br />\ngame was by far the most interesting, and the best played. The<br />\ngame continued fairly even for<br />\nabout fifteen moves. Then Melamet began getting a somewhat<br />\nstronger position. Soon, however,<br />\nHammond thought he saw an opportunity for a quick checkmate<br />\nand sacrificed a rook to accomplish his purpose.
