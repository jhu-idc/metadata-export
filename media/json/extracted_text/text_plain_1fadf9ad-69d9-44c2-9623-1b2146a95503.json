This board will select a secretary and treasurer from its personnel, and will act as a unit in obtaining engagements, managing the<br />\nfunds, etc.<br />\nAfter the constitution was approved, the remaining elections<br />\nwere held. Edmund Spieker was<br />\nelected leader of the Glee Club and<br />\nWalter Geissel of the Instrumental<br />\nClub, both receiving unanimous<br />\nvotes. These men, together with<br />\nBaker, the president of the entire<br />\norganization, and two members<br />\nfrom the Clubs at large, will constitute the board of managers. The<br />\n. two inembers-at-large<br />\nelected were<br />\nOwens, pianist for last year's Clubs,<br />\nand Fred P. Hall, president of the<br />\n1917 class.<br />\nUnder the new constitution, the<br />\nleaders of the respective Clubs are<br />\ngiven full powers of training and<br />\nselection. To eliminate absence<br />\nfrom rehearsals and concerts a fine<br />\nWill be imposed<br />\ncut. It<br />\nis hoped in this for eachprevent<br />\na<br />\nway to<br />\nrecurrence of the very frequent and<br />\n\"timely absences which characterized many of last year's concerts.<br />\nThe dues have been fixed at three<br />\ndollars per annum, to be returned,<br />\nif possible, at the end of the year.<br />\nAny member of the University may<br />\nbecome a member of the organization. It is not necessary for him<br />\nto take an<br />\nactive part in the Clubs'<br />\nactivities--he may be a sort of silent<br />\nPartner, obtaining free admission to<br />\nall \u2022 cOncerts. Moreover, if any<br />\nmoney is made (luring the year, besides the return of the original<br />\nthree dollars, -dividends will be paid<br />\non the<br />\nstock\u2014one dollar being considered a share. The Clubs want<br />\nnot Only a successful financial sea!,on, but also desire that the entire<br />\nuniversity take an active interest<br />\nin their<br />\nwork.<br />\nFrom now on, the two Clubs will<br />\ncomplete their organizations separately. Music has been ordered<br />\nand rehearsals soon will commence.<br />\nThe Clubs are a little late in beginning to prepare for their season,<br />\nbut the organization, which has<br />\ncaused the lateness, is the reason<br />\nWhich has enabled them to have a<br />\nseason at all, and the plans just<br />\n<br />\nFollowing the Hopkins custom,<br />\na brass band will assist the rooters<br />\nin producing enthusing din and inspiring discord at the games with<br />\nWestern Maryland and St. John's,<br />\nto be played on November 21 and<br />\n26, respectively.<br />\nWe are informed by explorers<br />\nthat all peoples, even the most<br />\nprimitive, are fond of something<br />\nwhich they regard as music. Not<br />\nonly when feasting or dancing do<br />\nthey love to hear the crash of cymbals or the roll of drums, but even<br />\nmore when marching into battle<br />\nthey long for the shrill squealing<br />\nof the wry-necked fife, or the dull,<br />\nmonotonous booming of the tomtorn. What more appropriate then,<br />\nthan that the Hopkins warriors<br />\nshould be spurred on to slaughter<br />\nby strains of melody floating.over<br />\nfrom the concrete grand-stand.<br />\nThe objection that the band invariably drowns the noblest efforts<br />\nof the loyal rooters is indeed a negligible one. The great purpose of<br />\nrooting is to make a noise\u2014if the<br />\nband can make a louder noise, why<br />\nnot encourage it to (10 so? Again,<br />\nin these prevalent hard times, any<br />\nmovement which serves to give employment to an otherwise idle class<br />\nis indeed a praiseworthy one. Last<br />\nof all, \"Jack\" DeWitt, cheer leader,<br />\nwould undoubtedly appreciate a<br />\nchance to rest.<br />\nIt is just here, however, that an<br />\nunfortunate complication arises.<br />\nStrange, almost unaccountable, as<br />\nit may seem to those who have<br />\nheard the music, the band insists<br />\nupon being paid. And this affords<br />\nan opportunity for every Hopkins<br />\nman to show his college spirit. A<br />\npublic subscription AM be held, and<br />\nthe names of the committee authorized to collect the funds will be<br />\npublished in the columns of THE<br />\nNEWS-LETTnR. The rest will depend on every separate and individual student at the University.<br />\nDo your part, and see that your<br />\nfriends do theirs. Christmas is a<br />\nlong way off yet, so we can all<br />\nafford to give a little bit. Let's<br />\nmake provision for a concert that<br />\nNvill make Sousa and Victor Herbert green with envy, and leave the<br />\nBoston Symphony panting ingloriously in our rear. The figures<br />\nare a little mixed here, but our one<br />\nparamount desire is clear: We want<br />\nto out-play our opponents in the<br />\nstands as well as on the field. We<br />\nwant that band at Homewood.<br />\n<br />\nRobert Layfield, quarterback of<br />\nthe Hopkins football team, was injured in Saturday's game with Lehigh. He is in St. Luke's Hospital,<br />\nSouth Bethlehem, Pa., and with<br />\nhim are his father, Manager Allen<br />\nF. Voshell, of the 'Varsity eleven,<br />\nand John L. Dorsey, last year's<br />\nmanager, who went to South Bethleham to see the game.<br />\nLayfield was injured in the early<br />\npart of the second period. He was<br />\nplaying far behind the line when<br />\nMattern, Lehigh's right halfback,<br />\nstarted out on a long end run.<br />\nMattern got away from all the Hopkins players except Layfield, and<br />\nwas coming down through an open<br />\nfield toward the goal posts when<br />\nthe little quarterback made a flying tackle to stop the run. He<br />\ndowned Mattern, landing under<br />\nhim when they fell. Mattern got<br />\nup, but Layfield could not move.<br />\nHe was carried from the field by a<br />\nLehigh player.<br />\nManager Voshell and Dorsey<br />\nwere on the side lines and immediately took the player to St. Luke's<br />\nHospital, where some of the best<br />\ndoctors in South Bethlehem examined him. The surgeons would not<br />\nmake a statement until an X-ray<br />\nphotograph had been made. This<br />\nwas done Sunday morning, and it<br />\nwas seen that his back had not been<br />\nbroken as had been said in dispatches sent out Saturday night.<br />\nHe is paralyzed from the waist<br />\ndown, and it is believed that he has<br />\nsuffered some injury to the spinal<br />\ncord, the nature of which is not revealed. His condition was reported unchanged early Monday morning. A consultation of doctors will<br />\nbe held, to determine what course<br />\nto pursue to bring about recovery.<br />\nLayfield is a resident of Wilmington, Del. He studied at<br />\nFriends' School there and played<br />\nend on the football team. His<br />\nfather, W. R. Layfield, is president<br />\nof the Atlas Powder Works. In<br />\nBaltimore he lives at the Central<br />\nYoung Men's Christian Association.<br />\nImmediately after he was taken<br />\nto the hospital his father was notified, and Hopkins players returning<br />\nhome after the game met Mr. Layfield in Philadelphia. Coaches Cates<br />\nand Hunter (lid not accompany the<br />\nteam on the trip.<br />\nCaptain Paul Wilkinson, too, was<br />\ninjured slightly in the third quarter. He was carrying the ball and<br />\nwas touched by three Lehigh men,<br />\nwhom Ile dragged several yards,<br />\nstraining the muscles of his leg.<br />\n<br />\nA squad of eighteen men journeyed to South Bethlehem Friday<br />\nafternoon to meet the heavy Brown<br />\nand White eleven of Lehigh, who<br />\nhad a clean record of five victories<br />\nahead of them.<br />\nFor the first quarter Hopkins<br />\nplayed a decided aggressive game,<br />\ncarrying the ball to within five<br />\nyards of the opponents' goal line<br />\ntwice, when both times Lehigh's<br />\nline braced and forced Hopkins to<br />\ngive the ball up on downs. It was<br />\nonly at the end of this period that<br />\nHopkins' goal line was endangered,<br />\nwhen Lehigh succeeded in placing<br />\nthe pigskin on her opponents' '0yard line.<br />\nA few moments after the opening of the second quarter, Fullback<br />\nHoban succeeded in crossing Hopkins' goal line for the Brown and<br />\n\\\\Mite's first tally, but missed goal.<br />\nWilkinson kicked off to Lehigh<br />\nwho, after a line plunge by Greene<br />\nand a forward pass to Sawtelle,<br />\nmade their second score soon after<br />\nby well-inteferenced end runs. Lehigh had discovered a weak point<br />\nin the Hopkins line, the ends. The<br />\nball was again put into play by<br />\nWilkinson kicking off to Hallowell,<br />\n\\dio caught the ball on the fiveyard line and was nailed on the 20yard mark. Two end runs netted<br />\ngains of 30 yards. On the next<br />\nplay a shift formation was resorted<br />\nto, the whole team swerving around<br />\nour right end as interference for<br />\nthe quarterback. The ends and<br />\nbackfield men were swept off their<br />\nfeet, with the exception of Bobbie<br />\nLayfield, who remained alone to<br />\ndefend the goal. Diving under the<br />\ninterference, he laid low his man<br />\nby the prettiest tackle seen this<br />\nseason. .It was at this point that<br />\nLayfield received his injury which<br />\nforced him to retire from the game.<br />\nIt was at the end of this quarter<br />\nthat the Black and Blue threatened<br />\nto cross the Brown and White goal<br />\nline. Randall made a pretty forward pass of 20 yards to Wilkinson, who made 20 more before being downed. On the next play<br />\nWilkinson was given the ball on<br />\nan off-tackle play which netted 20<br />\nyards more, placing the pigskin on<br />\nLehigh's io-yard line. Here the<br />\nBrown and White held for the<br />\nnecessary number of downs, forcing the ball to be given up on their<br />\nfour-yard line.<br />\nShortly after the opening of the<br />\nthird quarter, Hallowell received<br />\nRandall's punt and dodging through<br />\na broken field, ran 75 yards for a<br />\ntouchdown. Captain Wilkinson re-<br />\n<br />\ncompleted should tend to make that<br />\nseason one of the most successful in<br />\nHopkins' history.<br />\n<br />\n(Continued on page S, col. 2)<br />\n<br />\n\fTHE JOHNS HOPKINS NEWS\u2014LETTER, NOVEMBER 2, 1914.<br />\n<br />\n2<br />\nLaw<br />\n<br />\nSchool of the<br />\n<br />\nUniversity of Maryland<br />\nHon.

Saulsbury<br />\nShort, editor-in-chief.<br />\nAt this meeting plans for the<br />\nsenior class-book were discussed,<br />\nand many interesting ideas and<br />\nsuggestions were submitted.<br />\nThe Board means to get down<br />\nto work at once and has decided<br />\nto hold its weekly meetings on<br />\nTuesdays at one o'clock in the<br />\nTrophy Room. It was the general<br />\nopinion of those present that the<br />\nHullabaloo, too, should be representative of the three lower classes,<br />\nas well as of the senior. The<br />\nheads of the editorial, art and<br />\nbusiness departments reported progress. The Board already has a<br />\n\"wealth of material\" that it has<br />\ncollected during the last two years.<br />\nArt Director Avra Warren invites<br />\nthe entire University to hand in<br />\nBusiness<br />\nartistic contributions.<br />\nManager Spencer reported that<br />\nmany of the men of the senior<br />\nclass had already had their pictures<br />\ntaken. He also had suggestions to<br />\nmake regarding the business end<br />\nof the Hullabaloo. The success of<br />\nthe book depends to a large degree<br />\nupon the advertisements, and Mr.<br />\nSpencer urged the other departments of the Board to co-operate<br />\nwith the advertising manager as<br />\nmuch as possible.<br />\nMembers of the senior class<br />\ncan have their pictures taken as<br />\nsoon as they obtain a slip from<br />\n\"Bill\" Baker, who is in charge of<br />\nthe photographic department. Judging by the progress made already,<br />\nthere is no reason why the 1915<br />\nHullabaloo ought not be the best<br />\nyet. The Board wants the cooperation of the entire student<br />\nbody, and believes that there will<br />\nbe an immediate response.<br />\nWhen the meeting of the Board<br />\nwas over it found awaiting it a<br />\n\"Hallowe'en party.\" While seated<br />\nat the table a \"witch\" entered bearing a placard saying \"No Pumpkin<br />\nHeads on the 1915 Hullabaloo<br />\nBoard.\" She next distributed roses<br />\nto the Board. To each rose was<br />\nattached a quotation wishing success to the 1915 book. Before the<br />\nBoard was able to find out who<br />\nthe \"witch\" was, she had vanished<br />\nas quickly as she had appeared.<br />\nThe \"witch's\" visit was taken as a<br />\nfavorable omen, and the Board<br />\nnow believes that the success of<br />\nthe book is assured. The delightful party was broken up by all<br />\narising and singing the class's anthem, \"Whan That Aprille,\" etc.,<br />\nto the tune of \"Good Night<br />\nLadies.\"<br />\nThe members of the Board are<br />\nShort, Spencer, Warren, Baker,<br />\nMerrick, Brooks, Bartlett, Troxell,<br />\nNicholson, Lindau, Weech and<br />\nTarr.<br />\n<br />\nAs announced last week, Hopkins expects to send a team to participate in the cross-country run<br />\nwhich will be held at Lexington,<br />\nVa., under the auspices of the<br />\nSouthern Intercollegiate Track Association. The small \u2022 number of<br />\ncandidates for this team indicates<br />\nclearly that the student body is<br />\nlacking in interest, or active interest, at least.<br />\nWhile only about ten men are to<br />\nbe sent to the event at Lexington,<br />\nthe number of candidates so far<br />\nis disappointing.<br />\nPractice is held every afternoon<br />\nat Homewood at 5.20 o'clock under<br />\nthe direction of Coach \"Joe\" England. The practice itself is very<br />\nsimple, and requires only a little<br />\ntime each afternoon. The candidates gradually increase the distance of their run until the required<br />\ndistance is reached. There can be<br />\nno doubt that such a systematic<br />\ntraining is of physic41 benefit to the<br />\ncandidates.<br />\nThe men who have been reporting at Homewood are: Penniman,<br />\nFred Hall, Strauss, Binford, Poole,<br />\nBrower and Niles. Several of these<br />\nmen, however, are not candidates<br />\nfor the cross-country team. Everhard Deems, '15, manager of the<br />\ntrack team, urges all candidates\u2014<br />\nold and new\u2014for the track team<br />\nto participate in this practice at<br />\nHomewood.<br />\nThe date of the meet at Lexington has not been definitely arranged, but it will probably come<br />\nin the last week of this month.<br />\nThe,building of the schedule of<br />\nthe 1915 track team is already being carried on by Manager Deems.<br />\nOn his list are the University of<br />\nVirginia, Lehigh and Navy, besides the regular annual opponents,<br />\nand meets or meetings with representative squads may be arranged.<br />\n<br />\nAfternoon and Evening Sessions<br />\nFor catalogue apply to<br />\n<br />\nEDWIN T.DICKERSON.Secretary,301 St.Paul St<br />\n<br />\nNew Xttiser oil inter (6arbru<br />\nMadison and North Ayes.<br />\n<br />\nFederoff's String Quartette<br />\n<br />\nSTRATTON<br />\n<br />\nTHE SHIRT MAKER<br />\n<br />\n226 N.

He is popular and has<br />\nmade a great many friends during<br />\nthe month he has been at Hopkins.<br />\nIt is because of this pluck and<br />\nPopularity that his friends of the<br />\nteam and in the student body wish<br />\nfor him a speedy recovery, and THE<br />\nNEWS-LTTER expresses this sentiment, reflecting the concern and<br />\nsympathy which are felt generally<br />\nbecause of his condition.<br />\nSaturday's Games and Varsity's Chances.<br />\n<br />\nThe decisive defeat of \\Vestern<br />\nMaryland by St. John's on Saturday, 34 to o, has materially increased the complexity of speculation as to the outcome of this year's<br />\nstruggle for the state championship.<br />\nThree weeks ago Maryland Agricultural College suffered defeat at<br />\nthe hands of Western Maryland,<br />\na week'later the Farmers won from<br />\nSt. John's and now St. John's defeats Western Maryland by an<br />\noverwhelming score. An explanation may partly be found in the<br />\nfact that the Aggies braced after<br />\ntheir loss to Western Maryland and<br />\nfaced St. John's with a much<br />\nstronger team than that which<br />\nplayed the up-state eleven; however, it is evident that the Annapolis team is putting up a good game,<br />\nand will undoubtedly be in fighting trim on Thanksgiving Day.<br />\nCircumstances point to a hard battle when Hopkins again meets its<br />\nold foe.<br />\nThe other games still to be played<br />\nthis year promise to be highly in-<br />\n<br />\nCan Win State Championship.<br />\n<br />\nThe Maryland Aggies, since they<br />\nhave defeated Hopkins and St.<br />\nJohn's, are beginning to lay claim<br />\nto the state championship.<br />\nThey do not recall, however, that<br />\nthey have been defeated by Western<br />\nMaryland, 20 to 13, and that St.<br />\nJohn's has defeated Western Maryland, 34 to o.<br />\nThus, the race for the title becomes an almost hopeless tangle.<br />\nBut the Aggies, although they have<br />\nput crimps in the aspirations of St.<br />\nJohn's and Hopkins, have been<br />\n\"crimped\" themselves by Western<br />\nMaryland. Western Maryland has<br />\nbeen defeated by St. John's.

Rays from fixed<br />\nsources of light were reflected by<br />\nthese mirrors on a scale placed a<br />\nshort distance in front of the apparatus, and the zero reading noted.<br />\nWhen the violin was bowed, the<br />\nresonator, whose frequency was the<br />\nsame as the fundamental note produced on the instrument, began to<br />\nvibrate, and the disk at its opening was twisted around. The intensity of its vibration was measured by the image which the mirror cast upon the scale. Vibrations<br />\nwere likewise perceived in the few<br />\nother resonators corresponding, in<br />\n..period, to the upper partials.<br />\nIn order to get more marked<br />\ndifferences, the experiments were<br />\ncarried on with violins which musicians pronounced of good quality,<br />\nand with some very inferior ones.<br />\nThe difference in quality of the<br />\ntones produced manifested itself in<br />\nthe even distribution of energy<br />\namong the component parts of the<br />\nnotes of the better instruments and<br />\nin the total irregularity in the<br />\nothers. In tile first case, a large<br />\npercentage of the total energy was<br />\nexpended on the fundamental, and<br />\na decreasing amount on the upper<br />\npartials which averaged about four<br />\nin number. In the latter, there<br />\nwere frequently vibrations of 12<br />\npartials, and no regular arrangement of the distribution of energy<br />\namong the component parts was observed, all of which really amounts<br />\nto the fact that cheap violins frequently squeak.<br />\nThe energy measured was, of<br />\ncourse, expressed in ergs.<br />\nThe judging of tone quality thus<br />\nhaving been brought to a measurable basis, it is not too much to<br />\nexpect innovations in the design of<br />\nour violins and a change for the<br />\nbetter.<br />\n<br />\nThe freshmen held their second<br />\nmeeting of the year last Thursday<br />\nat one o'clock in the chapel of the<br />\nYoung Men's Christian Association.<br />\nThe only class business of any moment was the ratification of a constitution.<br />\nThe meeting was opened by a<br />\ngeneral \"raking over the coals\" by<br />\nthe leaders of various student activities, who eloquently deplored the<br />\nfact that the \"fresilies\" had not<br />\nresponded to the calling of these<br />\nactivities as unitedly as has been<br />\nthe custom. \"Hoy\" Short, editorin-chief of THE NEws - LETTER,<br />\nmade a strong appeal for more candidates to compete for the freshman<br />\neditorships. It seems that only<br />\nabout one-third as many 1918 men<br />\nare competing for the jobs this<br />\nyear as has been the custom in previous years. C. E. Deems asked for<br />\nlarger attendance to the various<br />\nBible classes. He pointed out that<br />\nthe classes prove a source of pleasure, as well as knowledge, and that<br />\nthey deserved the hearty support<br />\nof the freshmen. \"Tommy\" Troxell advised those of the class who<br />\ndesired to go out for the lacrosse<br />\nteam to go over to the cage and<br />\nlimber up. Edmund Spieker solicited the support of the freshmen<br />\nto help make this season a successful one for the Glee Club. President Frank Sutton appealed to the<br />\nclass to uphold its honor by doing<br />\nits part to further the success of the<br />\nvarious student activities.<br />\nThe constiutional committee (Arthur Hooper, Morton Rothschild<br />\nand Page Nelson) submitted the<br />\nconstitution for ratification. It was<br />\naccepted with a few minor changes.<br />\nThe question of class colors and<br />\nclass pins was discussed and it was<br />\nfinally decided to put the matter in<br />\nthe hands of a committee.<br />\n<br />\nExaminer \u2014 Now, William, if a<br />\nman can do one-fourth of a piece<br />\nof work in two days, how long will<br />\nhe take to finish it?<br />\nWilliam\u2014Is it a contrac' job or<br />\nis he workin' by the day?\u2014Life.<br />\n<br />\nDr. Mustard Issues New Book.<br />\n<br />\nThe Johns Hopkins Press announced the publication of \"The<br />\nPiscatory Eclogues of Jacopo Sannavaro,\" edited by Dr. Wilfred P.<br />\nMustard, collegiate professor of<br />\nLatin.<br />\nThis is the second of a series of<br />\nstudies in the Latin poetry of the<br />\nRenaissance, and is uniform with<br />\nthe first study, \"The Eclogues of<br />\nBaptista Mantuanus.\"<br />\nThe book is dedicated to Dean<br />\nE.

The key to the<br />\nsituation lies in the distinction<br />\nmade last year between the clubs<br />\nand the teams. This distinction<br />\namounted to little more than a distinction of names last year, except<br />\ntrips,<br />\nin the case of some of the<br />\nManof<br />\nBoard<br />\nthe<br />\nyear<br />\nbut this<br />\nagers hopes to carry it out to the<br />\nextent to which it was originally<br />\nintended to apply.<br />\nTo define clearly the names, the<br />\nteams consist of the men chosen<br />\nthe<br />\nby the leaders to take part in the<br />\nof<br />\nmember<br />\nconcerts, while any<br />\nUniversity who is interested may<br />\nrebecome a member of the clubs,<br />\nor<br />\ntalent<br />\nmusical<br />\nhis<br />\ngardless of<br />\nability. The advantage to a man<br />\nof<br />\nwho does not take part in any<br />\nfinancial<br />\na<br />\nmainly<br />\nis<br />\nconcerts<br />\nthe<br />\none. He pays his dues\u2014three dollars at the beginning of the season<br />\nthe<br />\n\u2014just as the members who do<br />\nfurther<br />\nany<br />\nwithout<br />\nand<br />\ndo,<br />\nwork<br />\neffort on his part he is entitled to<br />\ntickets to all the concerts, and also<br />\nhis share in the profits of the club<br />\nis<br />\nat the end of the season. It<br />\nhoped that this year, under the<br />\nnew system of management, an appreciable profit will be realized, so<br />\nthat at the end of the season the<br />\nmembers will receive, in addition<br />\nto the three dollars invested, a dividend for their risk.<br />\nThe grounds for this belief are<br />\nas follows: The only venture last<br />\nyear in which money was actually<br />\nlost was the Christmas trip. So<br />\nmuch was lost, indeed, at this time<br />\nthat it was impossible to entirely<br />\nmake up the deficit during the rest<br />\nof the season. As there will be no<br />\nlong trip at Christmas time this<br />\nyear, the large loss will not recur,<br />\nand the profit from the other trips<br />\nand concerts will go into the treasury of the clubs. Another improvement that will make the smaller Baltimore concerts more successful, is<br />\nthe arrangement of the schedule<br />\nproviding these local concerts before the trips have all been made.<br />\nAs a matter of fact it was impossible to collect any money from<br />\nsome of the concerts last year,<br />\nowing to the poor attendance of<br />\nthe member of the teams.<br />\n<br />\n7<br />\n<br />\nGeorgie came with his steel-grey<br />\nThe correction of these two Then fleet<br />\nresult<br />\nto<br />\nstriking mistakes ought<br />\nTo help little Belgium, so near,<br />\nin a considerable profit, and any And he said to the crowned head of<br />\nman who has a predeliction for<br />\ne the map in this hemichuaro<br />\nnrge,<br />\nI'll E<br />\nspeculation is invited to become a<br />\nsphere.*<br />\nmember of the clubs by the investyour hand, Lord Bill, Brussells<br />\nment of three dollars when the 0 holdsaid,<br />\nd<br />\nEscall is made by the treasurer.<br />\n, strokes are wondrous, sair;<br />\nFor<br />\npecially those who are sure that Gold talers I can get many a ane,<br />\nWit cathedrals I'll never get mair.<br />\nthey will attend the McCoy Hall<br />\ndolconcert, by risking only one<br />\nThe War Lord's sons were killt one<br />\nby one,<br />\nlar more than they would pay for<br />\nUntil Billy was left alone.<br />\ntwo seats, have the chance of not<br />\nThen he prayed to King Albert, and<br />\nonly going to this and all other<br />\nNicholas, and George,<br />\nrealizactually<br />\nof<br />\nbut<br />\nfree,<br />\nconcerts<br />\nThat he might for his sins atone.<br />\ning a profit at the end of the season.<br />\nHis sons were buried in a Belgian<br />\nTim MANAGEMENT.<br />\nsquare<br />\nThanks!<br />\n<br />\nNew York, Oct. 29, 1914.<br />\nTo the Editor of THE NEWS-LETTER:<br />\nSIR \u2014 Permit me to commend<br />\n<br />\nmost sincerely the article appearing<br />\nin the present issue of THE NEWSLETTER on Sidney Lanier.

This alone was a cause<br />\nfor complaint. But when they rang<br />\nquarter-hours at the wrong time,<br />\nneighbors notified the authorities of<br />\nthe University that they were<br />\nalarmists and disturbers of the<br />\npeace. Of course people did not<br />\nunderstand that they had just been<br />\ninstalled and the false telling of<br />\ntime was part of the experiments<br />\nbeing made by workmen to see if<br />\nthe set of bells was satisfactory.<br />\nWhen the complaints were received, however, the bells were returned to the foundry. They have<br />\nbeen filed and polished, and when<br />\nreturned to the tower will be in<br />\nperfect harmony.<br />\n<br />\nBecause the colors of Harvard<br />\nUniversity are crimson and white,<br />\nstudents of the college probably<br />\nwill be prevented by law from<br />\ncarrying flags and pennants in parades and games in the Commonweath of Massachusetts.<br />\nFrequent Socialist demonstrations, all of them accompanied by<br />\nthe waving of red flags, caused a<br />\nlaw to be passed prohibiting the<br />\ncarrying of red flags in the State.<br />\nIt was meant to apply to the Socialists, and their leaders now declare that if their followers can not<br />\nbear the flaming color, neither can<br />\nany one else, and they intend to<br />\nsee to it that Harvard's crimson<br />\nreceives the same treatment as their<br />\nown color. Harvard parades, they<br />\npoint out, are always led by a standard bearer with a large red flag.<br />\nTheoretically' the law will prohibit Harvard's carrying a red flag,<br />\nand it is said that members of the<br />\nUniversity student body will walk<br />\ndown a Cambridge street with a<br />\nflag to be arrested and bring about<br />\na test case of the law. The Supreme Court has already upheld a<br />\ndecision affecting the Socialists,<br />\nand Harvard students believe it<br />\nwould be interesting to see how the<br />\nlaw will be dealt out to them.<br />\nShould the judges prohibit Harvard's flags from appearing on the<br />\nstreets, it is said that influential<br />\nalumni on the bench and at the bar<br />\nwill see that the statute is repealed.<br />\n<br />\n(THE EICHELBERGER BOOK CO.)<br />\n308 N.

This board will select a secretary and treasurer from its personnel, and will act as a unit in obtaining engagements, managing the<br />\nfunds, etc.<br />\nAfter the constitution was approved, the remaining elections<br />\nwere held. Edmund Spieker was<br />\nelected leader of the Glee Club and<br />\nWalter Geissel of the Instrumental<br />\nClub, both receiving unanimous<br />\nvotes. These men, together with<br />\nBaker, the president of the entire<br />\norganization, and two members<br />\nfrom the Clubs at large, will constitute the board of managers. The<br />\n. two inembers-at-large<br />\nelected were<br />\nOwens, pianist for last year's Clubs,<br />\nand Fred P. Hall, president of the<br />\n1917 class.<br />\nUnder the new constitution, the<br />\nleaders of the respective Clubs are<br />\ngiven full powers of training and<br />\nselection. To eliminate absence<br />\nfrom rehearsals and concerts a fine<br />\nWill be imposed<br />\ncut. It<br />\nis hoped in this for eachprevent<br />\na<br />\nway to<br />\nrecurrence of the very frequent and<br />\n\"timely absences which characterized many of last year's concerts.<br />\nThe dues have been fixed at three<br />\ndollars per annum, to be returned,<br />\nif possible, at the end of the year.<br />\nAny member of the University may<br />\nbecome a member of the organization. It is not necessary for him<br />\nto take an<br />\nactive part in the Clubs'<br />\nactivities--he may be a sort of silent<br />\nPartner, obtaining free admission to<br />\nall \u2022 cOncerts. Moreover, if any<br />\nmoney is made (luring the year, besides the return of the original<br />\nthree dollars, -dividends will be paid<br />\non the<br />\nstock\u2014one dollar being considered a share. The Clubs want<br />\nnot Only a successful financial sea!,on, but also desire that the entire<br />\nuniversity take an active interest<br />\nin their<br />\nwork.<br />\nFrom now on, the two Clubs will<br />\ncomplete their organizations separately. Music has been ordered<br />\nand rehearsals soon will commence.<br />\nThe Clubs are a little late in beginning to prepare for their season,<br />\nbut the organization, which has<br />\ncaused the lateness, is the reason<br />\nWhich has enabled them to have a<br />\nseason at all, and the plans just<br /><br />\nFollowing the Hopkins custom,<br />\na brass band will assist the rooters<br />\nin producing enthusing din and inspiring discord at the games with<br />\nWestern Maryland and St. John's,<br />\nto be played on November 21 and<br />\n26, respectively.<br />\nWe are informed by explorers<br />\nthat all peoples, even the most<br />\nprimitive, are fond of something<br />\nwhich they regard as music. Not<br />\nonly when feasting or dancing do<br />\nthey love to hear the crash of cymbals or the roll of drums, but even<br />\nmore when marching into battle<br />\nthey long for the shrill squealing<br />\nof the wry-necked fife, or the dull,<br />\nmonotonous booming of the tomtorn. What more appropriate then,<br />\nthan that the Hopkins warriors<br />\nshould be spurred on to slaughter<br />\nby strains of melody floating.over<br />\nfrom the concrete grand-stand.<br />\nThe objection that the band invariably drowns the noblest efforts<br />\nof the loyal rooters is indeed a negligible one. The great purpose of<br />\nrooting is to make a noise\u2014if the<br />\nband can make a louder noise, why<br />\nnot encourage it to (10 so? Again,<br />\nin these prevalent hard times, any<br />\nmovement which serves to give employment to an otherwise idle class<br />\nis indeed a praiseworthy one. Last<br />\nof all, \"Jack\" DeWitt, cheer leader,<br />\nwould undoubtedly appreciate a<br />\nchance to rest.<br />\nIt is just here, however, that an<br />\nunfortunate complication arises.<br />\nStrange, almost unaccountable, as<br />\nit may seem to those who have<br />\nheard the music, the band insists<br />\nupon being paid. And this affords<br />\nan opportunity for every Hopkins<br />\nman to show his college spirit. A<br />\npublic subscription AM be held, and<br />\nthe names of the committee authorized to collect the funds will be<br />\npublished in the columns of THE<br />\nNEWS-LETTnR. The rest will depend on every separate and individual student at the University.<br />\nDo your part, and see that your<br />\nfriends do theirs. Christmas is a<br />\nlong way off yet, so we can all<br />\nafford to give a little bit. Let's<br />\nmake provision for a concert that<br />\nNvill make Sousa and Victor Herbert green with envy, and leave the<br />\nBoston Symphony panting ingloriously in our rear. The figures<br />\nare a little mixed here, but our one<br />\nparamount desire is clear: We want<br />\nto out-play our opponents in the<br />\nstands as well as on the field. We<br />\nwant that band at Homewood.<br /><br />\nRobert Layfield, quarterback of<br />\nthe Hopkins football team, was injured in Saturday's game with Lehigh. He is in St. Luke's Hospital,<br />\nSouth Bethlehem, Pa., and with<br />\nhim are his father, Manager Allen<br />\nF. Voshell, of the 'Varsity eleven,<br />\nand John L. Dorsey, last year's<br />\nmanager, who went to South Bethleham to see the game.<br />\nLayfield was injured in the early<br />\npart of the second period. He was<br />\nplaying far behind the line when<br />\nMattern, Lehigh's right halfback,<br />\nstarted out on a long end run.<br />\nMattern got away from all the Hopkins players except Layfield, and<br />\nwas coming down through an open<br />\nfield toward the goal posts when<br />\nthe little quarterback made a flying tackle to stop the run. He<br />\ndowned Mattern, landing under<br />\nhim when they fell. Mattern got<br />\nup, but Layfield could not move.<br />\nHe was carried from the field by a<br />\nLehigh player.<br />\nManager Voshell and Dorsey<br />\nwere on the side lines and immediately took the player to St. Luke's<br />\nHospital, where some of the best<br />\ndoctors in South Bethlehem examined him. The surgeons would not<br />\nmake a statement until an X-ray<br />\nphotograph had been made. This<br />\nwas done Sunday morning, and it<br />\nwas seen that his back had not been<br />\nbroken as had been said in dispatches sent out Saturday night.<br />\nHe is paralyzed from the waist<br />\ndown, and it is believed that he has<br />\nsuffered some injury to the spinal<br />\ncord, the nature of which is not revealed. His condition was reported unchanged early Monday morning. A consultation of doctors will<br />\nbe held, to determine what course<br />\nto pursue to bring about recovery.<br />\nLayfield is a resident of Wilmington, Del. He studied at<br />\nFriends' School there and played<br />\nend on the football team. His<br />\nfather, W. R. Layfield, is president<br />\nof the Atlas Powder Works. In<br />\nBaltimore he lives at the Central<br />\nYoung Men's Christian Association.<br />\nImmediately after he was taken<br />\nto the hospital his father was notified, and Hopkins players returning<br />\nhome after the game met Mr. Layfield in Philadelphia. Coaches Cates<br />\nand Hunter (lid not accompany the<br />\nteam on the trip.<br />\nCaptain Paul Wilkinson, too, was<br />\ninjured slightly in the third quarter. He was carrying the ball and<br />\nwas touched by three Lehigh men,<br />\nwhom Ile dragged several yards,<br />\nstraining the muscles of his leg.<br /><br />\nA squad of eighteen men journeyed to South Bethlehem Friday<br />\nafternoon to meet the heavy Brown<br />\nand White eleven of Lehigh, who<br />\nhad a clean record of five victories<br />\nahead of them.<br />\nFor the first quarter Hopkins<br />\nplayed a decided aggressive game,<br />\ncarrying the ball to within five<br />\nyards of the opponents' goal line<br />\ntwice, when both times Lehigh's<br />\nline braced and forced Hopkins to<br />\ngive the ball up on downs. It was<br />\nonly at the end of this period that<br />\nHopkins' goal line was endangered,<br />\nwhen Lehigh succeeded in placing<br />\nthe pigskin on her opponents' '0yard line.<br />\nA few moments after the opening of the second quarter, Fullback<br />\nHoban succeeded in crossing Hopkins' goal line for the Brown and<br />\n\\\\Mite's first tally, but missed goal.<br />\nWilkinson kicked off to Lehigh<br />\nwho, after a line plunge by Greene<br />\nand a forward pass to Sawtelle,<br />\nmade their second score soon after<br />\nby well-inteferenced end runs. Lehigh had discovered a weak point<br />\nin the Hopkins line, the ends. The<br />\nball was again put into play by<br />\nWilkinson kicking off to Hallowell,<br />\n\\dio caught the ball on the fiveyard line and was nailed on the 20yard mark. Two end runs netted<br />\ngains of 30 yards. On the next<br />\nplay a shift formation was resorted<br />\nto, the whole team swerving around<br />\nour right end as interference for<br />\nthe quarterback. The ends and<br />\nbackfield men were swept off their<br />\nfeet, with the exception of Bobbie<br />\nLayfield, who remained alone to<br />\ndefend the goal. Diving under the<br />\ninterference, he laid low his man<br />\nby the prettiest tackle seen this<br />\nseason. .It was at this point that<br />\nLayfield received his injury which<br />\nforced him to retire from the game.<br />\nIt was at the end of this quarter<br />\nthat the Black and Blue threatened<br />\nto cross the Brown and White goal<br />\nline. Randall made a pretty forward pass of 20 yards to Wilkinson, who made 20 more before being downed. On the next play<br />\nWilkinson was given the ball on<br />\nan off-tackle play which netted 20<br />\nyards more, placing the pigskin on<br />\nLehigh's io-yard line. Here the<br />\nBrown and White held for the<br />\nnecessary number of downs, forcing the ball to be given up on their<br />\nfour-yard line.<br />\nShortly after the opening of the<br />\nthird quarter, Hallowell received<br />\nRandall's punt and dodging through<br />\na broken field, ran 75 yards for a<br />\ntouchdown. Captain Wilkinson re-<br /><br />\ncompleted should tend to make that<br />\nseason one of the most successful in<br />\nHopkins' history.<br /><br />\n(Continued on page S, col. 2)<br /><br />\nTHE JOHNS HOPKINS NEWS\u2014LETTER, NOVEMBER 2, 1914.<br /><br />\n2<br />\nLaw<br /><br />\nSchool of the<br /><br />\nUniversity of Maryland<br />\nHon.

Saulsbury<br />\nShort, editor-in-chief.<br />\nAt this meeting plans for the<br />\nsenior class-book were discussed,<br />\nand many interesting ideas and<br />\nsuggestions were submitted.<br />\nThe Board means to get down<br />\nto work at once and has decided<br />\nto hold its weekly meetings on<br />\nTuesdays at one o'clock in the<br />\nTrophy Room. It was the general<br />\nopinion of those present that the<br />\nHullabaloo, too, should be representative of the three lower classes,<br />\nas well as of the senior. The<br />\nheads of the editorial, art and<br />\nbusiness departments reported progress. The Board already has a<br />\n\"wealth of material\" that it has<br />\ncollected during the last two years.<br />\nArt Director Avra Warren invites<br />\nthe entire University to hand in<br />\nBusiness<br />\nartistic contributions.<br />\nManager Spencer reported that<br />\nmany of the men of the senior<br />\nclass had already had their pictures<br />\ntaken. He also had suggestions to<br />\nmake regarding the business end<br />\nof the Hullabaloo. The success of<br />\nthe book depends to a large degree<br />\nupon the advertisements, and Mr.<br />\nSpencer urged the other departments of the Board to co-operate<br />\nwith the advertising manager as<br />\nmuch as possible.<br />\nMembers of the senior class<br />\ncan have their pictures taken as<br />\nsoon as they obtain a slip from<br />\n\"Bill\" Baker, who is in charge of<br />\nthe photographic department. Judging by the progress made already,<br />\nthere is no reason why the 1915<br />\nHullabaloo ought not be the best<br />\nyet. The Board wants the cooperation of the entire student<br />\nbody, and believes that there will<br />\nbe an immediate response.<br />\nWhen the meeting of the Board<br />\nwas over it found awaiting it a<br />\n\"Hallowe'en party.\" While seated<br />\nat the table a \"witch\" entered bearing a placard saying \"No Pumpkin<br />\nHeads on the 1915 Hullabaloo<br />\nBoard.\" She next distributed roses<br />\nto the Board. To each rose was<br />\nattached a quotation wishing success to the 1915 book. Before the<br />\nBoard was able to find out who<br />\nthe \"witch\" was, she had vanished<br />\nas quickly as she had appeared.<br />\nThe \"witch's\" visit was taken as a<br />\nfavorable omen, and the Board<br />\nnow believes that the success of<br />\nthe book is assured. The delightful party was broken up by all<br />\narising and singing the class's anthem, \"Whan That Aprille,\" etc.,<br />\nto the tune of \"Good Night<br />\nLadies.\"<br />\nThe members of the Board are<br />\nShort, Spencer, Warren, Baker,<br />\nMerrick, Brooks, Bartlett, Troxell,<br />\nNicholson, Lindau, Weech and<br />\nTarr.<br /><br />\nAs announced last week, Hopkins expects to send a team to participate in the cross-country run<br />\nwhich will be held at Lexington,<br />\nVa., under the auspices of the<br />\nSouthern Intercollegiate Track Association. The small \u2022 number of<br />\ncandidates for this team indicates<br />\nclearly that the student body is<br />\nlacking in interest, or active interest, at least.<br />\nWhile only about ten men are to<br />\nbe sent to the event at Lexington,<br />\nthe number of candidates so far<br />\nis disappointing.<br />\nPractice is held every afternoon<br />\nat Homewood at 5.20 o'clock under<br />\nthe direction of Coach \"Joe\" England. The practice itself is very<br />\nsimple, and requires only a little<br />\ntime each afternoon. The candidates gradually increase the distance of their run until the required<br />\ndistance is reached. There can be<br />\nno doubt that such a systematic<br />\ntraining is of physic41 benefit to the<br />\ncandidates.<br />\nThe men who have been reporting at Homewood are: Penniman,<br />\nFred Hall, Strauss, Binford, Poole,<br />\nBrower and Niles. Several of these<br />\nmen, however, are not candidates<br />\nfor the cross-country team. Everhard Deems, '15, manager of the<br />\ntrack team, urges all candidates\u2014<br />\nold and new\u2014for the track team<br />\nto participate in this practice at<br />\nHomewood.<br />\nThe date of the meet at Lexington has not been definitely arranged, but it will probably come<br />\nin the last week of this month.<br />\nThe,building of the schedule of<br />\nthe 1915 track team is already being carried on by Manager Deems.<br />\nOn his list are the University of<br />\nVirginia, Lehigh and Navy, besides the regular annual opponents,<br />\nand meets or meetings with representative squads may be arranged.<br /><br />\nAfternoon and Evening Sessions<br />\nFor catalogue apply to<br /><br />\nEDWIN T.DICKERSON.Secretary,301 St.Paul St<br /><br />\nNew Xttiser oil inter (6arbru<br />\nMadison and North Ayes.<br /><br />\nFederoff's String Quartette<br /><br />\nSTRATTON<br /><br />\nTHE SHIRT MAKER<br /><br />\n226 N.

Vibrations<br />\nwere likewise perceived in the few<br />\nother resonators corresponding, in<br />\n..period, to the upper partials.<br />\nIn order to get more marked<br />\ndifferences, the experiments were<br />\ncarried on with violins which musicians pronounced of good quality,<br />\nand with some very inferior ones.<br />\nThe difference in quality of the<br />\ntones produced manifested itself in<br />\nthe even distribution of energy<br />\namong the component parts of the<br />\nnotes of the better instruments and<br />\nin the total irregularity in the<br />\nothers. In tile first case, a large<br />\npercentage of the total energy was<br />\nexpended on the fundamental, and<br />\na decreasing amount on the upper<br />\npartials which averaged about four<br />\nin number. In the latter, there<br />\nwere frequently vibrations of 12<br />\npartials, and no regular arrangement of the distribution of energy<br />\namong the component parts was observed, all of which really amounts<br />\nto the fact that cheap violins frequently squeak.<br />\nThe energy measured was, of<br />\ncourse, expressed in ergs.<br />\nThe judging of tone quality thus<br />\nhaving been brought to a measurable basis, it is not too much to<br />\nexpect innovations in the design of<br />\nour violins and a change for the<br />\nbetter.<br /><br />\nThe freshmen held their second<br />\nmeeting of the year last Thursday<br />\nat one o'clock in the chapel of the<br />\nYoung Men's Christian Association.<br />\nThe only class business of any moment was the ratification of a constitution.<br />\nThe meeting was opened by a<br />\ngeneral \"raking over the coals\" by<br />\nthe leaders of various student activities, who eloquently deplored the<br />\nfact that the \"fresilies\" had not<br />\nresponded to the calling of these<br />\nactivities as unitedly as has been<br />\nthe custom. \"Hoy\" Short, editorin-chief of THE NEws - LETTER,<br />\nmade a strong appeal for more candidates to compete for the freshman<br />\neditorships. It seems that only<br />\nabout one-third as many 1918 men<br />\nare competing for the jobs this<br />\nyear as has been the custom in previous years. C. E. Deems asked for<br />\nlarger attendance to the various<br />\nBible classes. He pointed out that<br />\nthe classes prove a source of pleasure, as well as knowledge, and that<br />\nthey deserved the hearty support<br />\nof the freshmen. \"Tommy\" Troxell advised those of the class who<br />\ndesired to go out for the lacrosse<br />\nteam to go over to the cage and<br />\nlimber up. Edmund Spieker solicited the support of the freshmen<br />\nto help make this season a successful one for the Glee Club.

The key to the<br />\nsituation lies in the distinction<br />\nmade last year between the clubs<br />\nand the teams. This distinction<br />\namounted to little more than a distinction of names last year, except<br />\ntrips,<br />\nin the case of some of the<br />\nManof<br />\nBoard<br />\nthe<br />\nyear<br />\nbut this<br />\nagers hopes to carry it out to the<br />\nextent to which it was originally<br />\nintended to apply.<br />\nTo define clearly the names, the<br />\nteams consist of the men chosen<br />\nthe<br />\nby the leaders to take part in the<br />\nof<br />\nmember<br />\nconcerts, while any<br />\nUniversity who is interested may<br />\nrebecome a member of the clubs,<br />\nor<br />\ntalent<br />\nmusical<br />\nhis<br />\ngardless of<br />\nability. The advantage to a man<br />\nof<br />\nwho does not take part in any<br />\nfinancial<br />\na<br />\nmainly<br />\nis<br />\nconcerts<br />\nthe<br />\none. He pays his dues\u2014three dollars at the beginning of the season<br />\nthe<br />\n\u2014just as the members who do<br />\nfurther<br />\nany<br />\nwithout<br />\nand<br />\ndo,<br />\nwork<br />\neffort on his part he is entitled to<br />\ntickets to all the concerts, and also<br />\nhis share in the profits of the club<br />\nis<br />\nat the end of the season. It<br />\nhoped that this year, under the<br />\nnew system of management, an appreciable profit will be realized, so<br />\nthat at the end of the season the<br />\nmembers will receive, in addition<br />\nto the three dollars invested, a dividend for their risk.<br />\nThe grounds for this belief are<br />\nas follows: The only venture last<br />\nyear in which money was actually<br />\nlost was the Christmas trip. So<br />\nmuch was lost, indeed, at this time<br />\nthat it was impossible to entirely<br />\nmake up the deficit during the rest<br />\nof the season. As there will be no<br />\nlong trip at Christmas time this<br />\nyear, the large loss will not recur,<br />\nand the profit from the other trips<br />\nand concerts will go into the treasury of the clubs. Another improvement that will make the smaller Baltimore concerts more successful, is<br />\nthe arrangement of the schedule<br />\nproviding these local concerts before the trips have all been made.<br />\nAs a matter of fact it was impossible to collect any money from<br />\nsome of the concerts last year,<br />\nowing to the poor attendance of<br />\nthe member of the teams.<br /><br />\n7<br /><br />\nGeorgie came with his steel-grey<br />\nThe correction of these two Then fleet<br />\nresult<br />\nto<br />\nstriking mistakes ought<br />\nTo help little Belgium, so near,<br />\nin a considerable profit, and any And he said to the crowned head of<br />\nman who has a predeliction for<br />\ne the map in this hemichuaro<br />\nnrge,<br />\nI'll E<br />\nspeculation is invited to become a<br />\nsphere.*<br />\nmember of the clubs by the investyour hand, Lord Bill, Brussells<br />\nment of three dollars when the 0 holdsaid,<br />\nd<br />\nEscall is made by the treasurer.<br />\n, strokes are wondrous, sair;<br />\nFor<br />\npecially those who are sure that Gold talers I can get many a ane,<br />\nWit cathedrals I'll never get mair.<br />\nthey will attend the McCoy Hall<br />\ndolconcert, by risking only one<br />\nThe War Lord's sons were killt one<br />\nby one,<br />\nlar more than they would pay for<br />\nUntil Billy was left alone.<br />\ntwo seats, have the chance of not<br />\nThen he prayed to King Albert, and<br />\nonly going to this and all other<br />\nNicholas, and George,<br />\nrealizactually<br />\nof<br />\nbut<br />\nfree,<br />\nconcerts<br />\nThat he might for his sins atone.<br />\ning a profit at the end of the season.<br />\nHis sons were buried in a Belgian<br />\nTim MANAGEMENT.<br />\nsquare<br />\nThanks!<br /><br />\nNew York, Oct. 29, 1914.<br />\nTo the Editor of THE NEWS-LETTER:<br />\nSIR \u2014 Permit me to commend<br /><br />\nmost sincerely the article appearing<br />\nin the present issue of THE NEWSLETTER on Sidney Lanier.

This alone was a cause<br />\nfor complaint. But when they rang<br />\nquarter-hours at the wrong time,<br />\nneighbors notified the authorities of<br />\nthe University that they were<br />\nalarmists and disturbers of the<br />\npeace. Of course people did not<br />\nunderstand that they had just been<br />\ninstalled and the false telling of<br />\ntime was part of the experiments<br />\nbeing made by workmen to see if<br />\nthe set of bells was satisfactory.<br />\nWhen the complaints were received, however, the bells were returned to the foundry. They have<br />\nbeen filed and polished, and when<br />\nreturned to the tower will be in<br />\nperfect harmony.<br /><br />\nBecause the colors of Harvard<br />\nUniversity are crimson and white,<br />\nstudents of the college probably<br />\nwill be prevented by law from<br />\ncarrying flags and pennants in parades and games in the Commonweath of Massachusetts.<br />\nFrequent Socialist demonstrations, all of them accompanied by<br />\nthe waving of red flags, caused a<br />\nlaw to be passed prohibiting the<br />\ncarrying of red flags in the State.<br />\nIt was meant to apply to the Socialists, and their leaders now declare that if their followers can not<br />\nbear the flaming color, neither can<br />\nany one else, and they intend to<br />\nsee to it that Harvard's crimson<br />\nreceives the same treatment as their<br />\nown color. Harvard parades, they<br />\npoint out, are always led by a standard bearer with a large red flag.<br />\nTheoretically' the law will prohibit Harvard's carrying a red flag,<br />\nand it is said that members of the<br />\nUniversity student body will walk<br />\ndown a Cambridge street with a<br />\nflag to be arrested and bring about<br />\na test case of the law. The Supreme Court has already upheld a<br />\ndecision affecting the Socialists,<br />\nand Harvard students believe it<br />\nwould be interesting to see how the<br />\nlaw will be dealt out to them.<br />\nShould the judges prohibit Harvard's flags from appearing on the<br />\nstreets, it is said that influential<br />\nalumni on the bench and at the bar<br />\nwill see that the statute is repealed.<br /><br />\n(THE EICHELBERGER BOOK CO.)<br />\n308 N.
