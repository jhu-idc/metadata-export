If men are to be deferred from military<br />\nduty to attend college, they must be the men who<br />\nwiliabest serve the nation when they have finished.<br />\nThey must not be prevented from preparing themselves<br />\nas the leaders of the future merely because of the<br />\nfinancial status of their parents. As a step toward<br />\nmaking the most efficient use of manpower, the Taft<br />\nbill's provision of government scholarships for needy<br />\nstudents catmot be too highly praised.<br />\nBut the method of choosing the' most capable students is not clearly indicated. Supposedly, they would<br />\nbe selected by competitir mental and physical examinations. Yet the system for administering these examinations is passed off with the mere ptovision for a single<br />\nadministrator.<br />\nIf he should set up a system of'uniform federal examinations, however, new difficulties would ensue. The<br />\nonly persons qualified to draw up and grade the examinations and to supervise their conduct are the presidents and faculties of the colleges themselves. The<br />\nremoval of these men to a centralized federal agency<br />\ncould have but one effect: a lowering of the quality of<br />\ncollege education.<br />\nBut there is one way to have education on merit<br />\nwithout depleting, college staffs: the limitation of the<br />\nfederal administrator to the establishment of scholarships, the fixing Of quotas, and the setting of broad<br />\nstandards of enrollment. The actual choosing of qualified students must be left to the individual colleges.<br />\nIf this kind of decentralization comes out of the Taft<br />\nbill, the colleges and the government will have come<br />\nto an intelligent understanding about their common<br />\npurpose.<br />\n<br />\nEnrollment<br />\nIn Wartime<br />\n<br />\nThe last week has seen<br />\ntwo<br />\n<br />\nA Tribute<br />\nAnd A Wish<br />\n<br />\nimportant changes in<br />\n<br />\nthe history department: its<br />\nchairman, Dr Kent Roberts<br />\nGreenfield,<br />\n<br />\nwas<br />\n<br />\ngranted<br />\n<br />\nleave<br />\n<br />\nof absence to become<br />\na major in the United States army; and several months<br />\nof speculation ended in the announcement that Mr J<br />\nMontgomery Gambrill is to be acting professor<br />\nof<br />\n<br />\nea<br />\nuektijaWiifiete;ortrtwei;sel teriiaiy7<br />\n<br />\nA Review<br />\n<br />\nBowman On Geopoliticians<br />\n<br />\n-forth which seem to indicate that<br />\n\"Geography vs. Geopolitics,\" by<br />\nBy ERNEST GoHN<br />\nthe \"science\" of geopolitics is nothing<br />\nIsaiah Bowman, in The GeograGuest in the House, a play by<br />\nbut an excuse for Nazi conquest;<br />\nphical Review, published quarterwhich<br />\nEunson,<br />\nDale<br />\nand<br />\nWilde<br />\nHagar<br />\nInd, indeed, the Third Reich has ally by the American Geographiwas presented on the boards of<br />\nways'made use of the incontrovertible<br />\nOctocal Society, New York, for<br />\nFord's theater .last week is one of<br />\nprinciples of its geopolitical masterber 1, 1942.<br />\nthose things which you can either<br />\nminds for propaganda material.<br />\nBy AMOS TAYLOR<br />\ntake or leave\u2014and the best thing<br />\nThis kind of hocus-pocus is felt by<br />\nBefore accepting his present posi- Dr Bowman to be an affront to the<br />\nto do is to leave it.

If men are to be deferred from military<br />\nduty to attend college, they must be the men who<br />\nwiliabest serve the nation when they have finished.<br />\nThey must not be prevented from preparing themselves<br />\nas the leaders of the future merely because of the<br />\nfinancial status of their parents. As a step toward<br />\nmaking the most efficient use of manpower, the Taft<br />\nbill's provision of government scholarships for needy<br />\nstudents catmot be too highly praised.<br />\nBut the method of choosing the' most capable students is not clearly indicated. Supposedly, they would<br />\nbe selected by competitir mental and physical examinations. Yet the system for administering these examinations is passed off with the mere ptovision for a single<br />\nadministrator.<br />\nIf he should set up a system of'uniform federal examinations, however, new difficulties would ensue. The<br />\nonly persons qualified to draw up and grade the examinations and to supervise their conduct are the presidents and faculties of the colleges themselves. The<br />\nremoval of these men to a centralized federal agency<br />\ncould have but one effect: a lowering of the quality of<br />\ncollege education.<br />\nBut there is one way to have education on merit<br />\nwithout depleting, college staffs: the limitation of the<br />\nfederal administrator to the establishment of scholarships, the fixing Of quotas, and the setting of broad<br />\nstandards of enrollment. The actual choosing of qualified students must be left to the individual colleges.<br />\nIf this kind of decentralization comes out of the Taft<br />\nbill, the colleges and the government will have come<br />\nto an intelligent understanding about their common<br />\npurpose.<br /><br />\nEnrollment<br />\nIn Wartime<br /><br />\nThe last week has seen<br />\ntwo<br /><br />\nA Tribute<br />\nAnd A Wish<br /><br />\nimportant changes in<br /><br />\nthe history department: its<br />\nchairman, Dr Kent Roberts<br />\nGreenfield,<br /><br />\nwas<br /><br />\ngranted<br /><br />\nleave<br /><br />\nof absence to become<br />\na major in the United States army; and several months<br />\nof speculation ended in the announcement that Mr J<br />\nMontgomery Gambrill is to be acting professor<br />\nof<br /><br />\nea<br />\nuektijaWiifiete;ortrtwei;sel teriiaiy7<br /><br />\nA Review<br /><br />\nBowman On Geopoliticians<br /><br />\n-forth which seem to indicate that<br />\n\"Geography vs. Geopolitics,\" by<br />\nBy ERNEST GoHN<br />\nthe \"science\" of geopolitics is nothing<br />\nIsaiah Bowman, in The GeograGuest in the House, a play by<br />\nbut an excuse for Nazi conquest;<br />\nphical Review, published quarterwhich<br />\nEunson,<br />\nDale<br />\nand<br />\nWilde<br />\nHagar<br />\nInd, indeed, the Third Reich has ally by the American Geographiwas presented on the boards of<br />\nways'made use of the incontrovertible<br />\nOctocal Society, New York, for<br />\nFord's theater .last week is one of<br />\nprinciples of its geopolitical masterber 1, 1942.<br />\nthose things which you can either<br />\nminds for propaganda material.<br />\nBy AMOS TAYLOR<br />\ntake or leave\u2014and the best thing<br />\nThis kind of hocus-pocus is felt by<br />\nBefore accepting his present posi- Dr Bowman to be an affront to the<br />\nto do is to leave it.
