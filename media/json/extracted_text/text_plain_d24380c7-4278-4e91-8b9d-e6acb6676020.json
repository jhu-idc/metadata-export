Who knows<br />\nwhat the current reason is? The Marines went into<br />\nSanto Domingo with the avowed intention of establishing<br />\na demilitarized zone to protect our citizens.

The conflict has only recently become apparent as the<br />\nwarm weather has brought both<br />\ngroups out of doors. Hence they<br />\nhave been colliding (for the<br />\nnorks have no eyes and the<br />\nsnorks no sense of smell), pitching each other off the end of the<br />\nnew library terrace into the<br />\nsculpture pit, and yelling obscene<br />\nand tasteless remarks at one another.<br />\nT. S.

MEGINNISS<br />\nIra Remsen, one day to be the<br />\nfirst professor of chemistry at the<br />\nJohns Hopkins University, was<br />\nforced by his father to study<br />\nmedicine. So he did. Sent by his<br />\nfather to the College of Physicians and Surgeons of Columbia<br />\nUniversity, he was graduated as<br />\na doctor of medicine in 1867. For<br />\na thesis, he wrote on the Fatty<br />\nDegeneration of the Liver.<br />\nBenjamin Harrow quotes Remsen as saying, eleven years later<br />\nIn 1878,\"My erudition in medical<br />\nmatters was exhibited in a thesis<br />\non the Fatty Degeneration of the<br />\nLiver, a subject on which I was<br />\nand am profoundly ignorant. I<br />\nhad, in fact, never seen a liver<br />\nwhich had undergone fatty degeneration, nor a patient who<br />\npossessed, or was supposed to<br />\npossess one; nor, I may add,<br />\nhave I had that pleasure up to<br />\nthis day.\" Yet Remsen, marvelously enough, received one of the<br />\ntwo awards given for the best<br />\nthesis! Such was the incredible<br />\nstate of medical education in the<br />\nU.S. at that time.<br />\nRemsen, as noted above, was<br />\nnot cut out for medicine. What<br />\nlittle exposure he had had to<br />\nchemistry, up to his graduation<br />\nfrom medical school, had fascinated him. Remsen himself describes what might be called his<br />\nfirst chemical experiment, which<br />\nhe performed when about 14<br />\nor 15:<br />\n\"While reading a text-book of<br />\nchemistry I came upon the statement, 'nitric acid acts upon copper.' I was getting tired of reading such ab.surb stuff and I determined to see what this meant.<br />\nCopper was more or less familiar<br />\nto me, for copper cents were<br />\nthen in use. I had seen a bottle<br />\nmarked 'nitric acid' on a table<br />\nin the doctor's office where I<br />\nwas then 'doing time.' I did not<br />\nknow its peculiarities, but I was<br />\ngetting on and likely to learn.<br />\nThe spirit of adventure was upon<br />\nme.<br />\nOpened Bottle<br />\n\"I . .<br />\nopened the bottle<br />\nmarked 'nitric acid'; poured<br />\nsome of the liquid on the copper; and prepared to take an<br />\nobservation. But what was this<br />\nwonderful thing I beheld? The<br />\ncent was already changed, and it<br />\nwas no small change either. A<br />\ngreenish blue liquid foamed and<br />\nfumed over the cent and over<br />\nthe table. The air in the neighborhood of the performance became colored dark red. A great<br />\ncloud arose. This was disagree-<br />\n<br />\nable and suffocating. How should<br />\nI stop this?<br />\n\"I tried to get rid of the<br />\nobjectionable mass by picking it<br />\nup and throwing it out of the<br />\nwindow, which I had meanwhile<br />\nopened. I learned another fact\u2014<br />\nnitric acid not only acts upon<br />\ncopper but it acts upon fingers.<br />\nThe pain led to another unpremeditated experiment. I drew<br />\nmy fingers across my trousers<br />\nand another fact was discovered.<br />\nNitric acid acts upon trousers.\"<br />\nChemistry Studied<br />\nIn 1867, Ira Remsen, M.D., set<br />\nout for Germany to study chemistry. He there studied under<br />\nVolhard and, later, Fittig, Five<br />\nyears after arriving in Germany,<br />\nhe had a Ph.D., considerable lecture and research experience,<br />\nand a ticket back to the U.S.:<br />\nbut he had no university position<br />\n<br />\nwaiting for him. He had no<br />\nchoice but to wait for an offer.<br />\nAfter long months of waiting,<br />\nhe was finally offered the position<br />\nof Professor of Chemistry at<br />\nWilliams College. When he arrived to take over his new position, he noticed that one thing<br />\nwas missing\u2014a chemistry laboratory! It took a year before he<br />\ncould get the trustees to build<br />\nhim one. During his four years<br />\nat Williams. Remsen wrote a<br />\ntextbook, Theoretical Chemistry,<br />\nand did research on the action<br />\nof ozone on various substances.<br />\nBoth his book and his research<br />\nwere successful.

The conflict has only recently become apparent as the<br />\nwarm weather has brought both<br />\ngroups out of doors. Hence they<br />\nhave been colliding (for the<br />\nnorks have no eyes and the<br />\nsnorks no sense of smell), pitching each other off the end of the<br />\nnew library terrace into the<br />\nsculpture pit, and yelling obscene<br />\nand tasteless remarks at one another.<br />\nT. S.

And if things continue, those who seek to maintain the status quo will only aid<br />\nthe diverse squad of Hopkins<br />\nsnorks.

MEGINNISS<br />\nIra Remsen, one day to be the<br />\nfirst professor of chemistry at the<br />\nJohns Hopkins University, was<br />\nforced by his father to study<br />\nmedicine. So he did. Sent by his<br />\nfather to the College of Physicians and Surgeons of Columbia<br />\nUniversity, he was graduated as<br />\na doctor of medicine in 1867. For<br />\na thesis, he wrote on the Fatty<br />\nDegeneration of the Liver.<br />\nBenjamin Harrow quotes Remsen as saying, eleven years later<br />\nIn 1878,\"My erudition in medical<br />\nmatters was exhibited in a thesis<br />\non the Fatty Degeneration of the<br />\nLiver, a subject on which I was<br />\nand am profoundly ignorant. I<br />\nhad, in fact, never seen a liver<br />\nwhich had undergone fatty degeneration, nor a patient who<br />\npossessed, or was supposed to<br />\npossess one; nor, I may add,<br />\nhave I had that pleasure up to<br />\nthis day.\" Yet Remsen, marvelously enough, received one of the<br />\ntwo awards given for the best<br />\nthesis! Such was the incredible<br />\nstate of medical education in the<br />\nU.S. at that time.<br />\nRemsen, as noted above, was<br />\nnot cut out for medicine. What<br />\nlittle exposure he had had to<br />\nchemistry, up to his graduation<br />\nfrom medical school, had fascinated him. Remsen himself describes what might be called his<br />\nfirst chemical experiment, which<br />\nhe performed when about 14<br />\nor 15:<br />\n\"While reading a text-book of<br />\nchemistry I came upon the statement, 'nitric acid acts upon copper.' I was getting tired of reading such ab.surb stuff and I determined to see what this meant.<br />\nCopper was more or less familiar<br />\nto me, for copper cents were<br />\nthen in use. I had seen a bottle<br />\nmarked 'nitric acid' on a table<br />\nin the doctor's office where I<br />\nwas then 'doing time.' I did not<br />\nknow its peculiarities, but I was<br />\ngetting on and likely to learn.<br />\nThe spirit of adventure was upon<br />\nme.<br />\nOpened Bottle<br />\n\"I . .<br />\nopened the bottle<br />\nmarked 'nitric acid'; poured<br />\nsome of the liquid on the copper; and prepared to take an<br />\nobservation. But what was this<br />\nwonderful thing I beheld? The<br />\ncent was already changed, and it<br />\nwas no small change either. A<br />\ngreenish blue liquid foamed and<br />\nfumed over the cent and over<br />\nthe table. The air in the neighborhood of the performance became colored dark red. A great<br />\ncloud arose. This was disagree-<br /><br />\nable and suffocating. How should<br />\nI stop this?<br />\n\"I tried to get rid of the<br />\nobjectionable mass by picking it<br />\nup and throwing it out of the<br />\nwindow, which I had meanwhile<br />\nopened. I learned another fact\u2014<br />\nnitric acid not only acts upon<br />\ncopper but it acts upon fingers.<br />\nThe pain led to another unpremeditated experiment.

He there studied under<br />\nVolhard and, later, Fittig, Five<br />\nyears after arriving in Germany,<br />\nhe had a Ph.D., considerable lecture and research experience,<br />\nand a ticket back to the U.S.:<br />\nbut he had no university position<br /><br />\nwaiting for him. He had no<br />\nchoice but to wait for an offer.<br />\nAfter long months of waiting,<br />\nhe was finally offered the position<br />\nof Professor of Chemistry at<br />\nWilliams College. When he arrived to take over his new position, he noticed that one thing<br />\nwas missing\u2014a chemistry laboratory! It took a year before he<br />\ncould get the trustees to build<br />\nhim one. During his four years<br />\nat Williams.
