Naturally,<br />\nthe text should have read \"the<br />\nlaw of Diminishing Returns.\"<br />\nDr. Long strongly advocated<br />\nthe increase of national economic resources spent on education. \"In this way,\" said Dr.<br />\nLong, \"We would be able to<br />\nmake college available to everYbody who is able to take advantage of advanced educational<br />\nopportunities.

Obviously<br />\nforewarned by an informer, a<br />\nGoucher campus policeman had<br />\nblocked the main entrance with<br />\na paddy wagon and brilliant red<br />\nflare. After inspecting each car<br />\nwith a flashlight, he told each<br />\ndriver in no uncertain terms to<br />\n\"get on back and don't try anything.\"<br />\nHowever, as evidenced by the<br />\nvan -colored filmy trophies later<br />\ndisplayed by a large number of<br />\nHopkins residents, the onslaught<br />\nwas not quite so unsuccessful as<br />\nhoped. A number of excited<br />\nstudents told how, after parking<br />\ntheir cars, they had approached<br />\nthe<br />\ncampus<br />\nundiscovered<br />\nthrough<br />\nwooded<br />\nareas and<br />\nreached the dormitories, gaining<br />\nentrance by breaking windows<br />\nor pushing through doors<br />\n\"It was easy,\" exclaimed one<br />\nof the raiders, later brandishing<br />\nhis prize with leopard-skin pattern and the head of a tiger<br />\nglaring stoically from the front.<br />\nHe reported that he and many<br />\nof his cohorts were readily admitted through dormitory win-<br />\n<br />\ndows by \"anxious and willing\"<br />\n\"Some<br />\nof<br />\nfemales.<br />\nthem<br />\nscreamed, but most of them<br />\ndidn't mind.

Each night while Manuel<br />\ndozed on his bough, one of Ed's brothers\u2014Fred or Jed\u2014would<br />\nsneak up the tree and replace him. \"How can I lose?\" said Ed<br />\nwith a fiendish giggle to his brother Fred or Jed.<br />\nBut Ed had a big surprise coming. For Manuel, though<br />\nhe did not know it himself, was a druid! He had been abandoned<br />\nas an infant at the hut of a poor and humble woodcutter named<br />\nCornelius Whitney Sigafoos III, who had raised the child as<br />\nhis own. So when Manuel got into the tree, he found much to<br />\nhis surprise that he had never in all his life felt so at home<br />\nand happy. He had absolutely no intention of ever leaving.<br />\nAfter seven or eight years Ed and his brothers wearied of the<br />\ncontest and conceded. Ursula Thing came to NIanuel's tree<br />\nand cried, \"I am yours! Come down and pin me!!<br />\nBut Manuel declined. Instead he asked Ursula to join him<br />\nin the tree.

When city police arrived<br />\nand discovered the invaders, \"we<br />\ndecided to leave, and fast,\" another commented.<br />\nSeveral Hopkins students were<br />\nreportedly caught and taken to<br />\npolice headquarters.

Thank heavens he didn't<br />\nsee my muddy shoes,\" a student<br />\nexplained.<br />\nHopkins Overrun<br />\nMeanwhile a similar line of<br />\ndestructive pranks were taking<br />\nplace right on the Homewood<br />\ncampus. A series of concentrated<br />\nefforts by a comparatively small<br />\ngroup of Hopkins students resulted in complete disruption of<br />\nthe area between Gilman Hall<br />\nand the dormitories.<br />\nOne of the participants in<br />\nFriday's early-morning shncligs<br />\nat Homewood gave this report:<br />\n\"The whole thing was a spurof-the moment affair, The only<br />\nthing we planned were the zeeds.<br />\nSomebody got the idea while<br />\nwatching the tractor plow up the<br />\nlawns in front of the dorms to<br />\nplant a garden where grass was<br />\nsupposed to grow.

With<br />\nabout five guys, we pushed the<br />\ncompressor into the ditch. Then<br />\nwe set to work on the power<br />\nshovel.

Charley's Aunt,<br />\nBrandon Thomas' popular theatrical warhorse, served to redeem the Barnstormers from<br />\nwhat would otherwise have been<br />\na season fraught with poor productions.<br />\nAt the risk of filling this review with superlatives, I must<br />\nadmit that the production was<br />\nexcellent. The acting was, without exception, quite good. The<br />\nsets, which were magnificently<br />\nexecuted, bore witness to the<br />\nhard work and time which went<br />\ninto their construction.<br />\nPlays To The Hilt<br />\nThe overall success of the play,<br />\nhowever, I would attribute to the<br />\ndirection by Lester Wolf. He is<br />\na master of the \"light touch\"<br />\nand is particularly successful<br />\nin directing comedy. His many<br />\nyears of acting and directing experience in the field of comedy<br />\nenabled him to make the element<br />\nof slapstick, with which the play<br />\nabounds, artful. I feel that without Mr. Wolf's guiding hand, the<br />\ntemptation to play up crudity<br />\nand slapstick would have proven<br />\ntoo much for the Barnstormers<br />\nto handle.<br />\nMichael Dale, incoming president of the Barnstormers, was<br />\nmuch more relaxed and animated<br />\nin the role of Jack Chesney than<br />\n<br />\nhe had been in his lamentable<br />\nperformance in Doctor's Dilemma a couple of months ago. Dennis Donahue, as Charley, did<br />\neverything the role demanded of<br />\nhim. Dan Tracy, as Brasset (not<br />\nBrassety, gentlemen) was con-<br />\n<br />\nvincing.<br />\nDavid Hochberg, as Charley's<br />\naunt, complete with long black<br />\ndress and wig, played his part to<br />\nthe hilt. His very expressive face<br />\nand his ability to do a \"double<br />\ntake\" greatly enhanced his performance. We particularly enjoyed the fiendish gleam in his<br />\neye when, in accepting a rose<br />\nfrom one of his \"admirers\", he<br />\nproclaimed, \"I'll have it stuffed!\"<br />\nMary Scheller, Mary Waesche,<br />\nJohn Gartland, Bill Bevans,<br />\nNancy Berendt, and Pat Lynch<br />\nwere the other members of this<br />\nfine cast.<br />\nApplaud Proposal<br />\nPerhaps the finest tribute to<br />\nthe acting ability of the Barnstormers came during the scene<br />\nbetween Michael Dale and Mary<br />\nScheller. Jack, having gotten<br />\nKitty alone, finally stammers<br />\nout a marriage proposal. When<br />\nhe finally got all the words out<br />\nand kissed Kitty, the audience<br />\nburst into spontaneous applause.<br />\nThe actors had succeeded in getting the audience to empathize<br />\nwith the characters on stage.<br />\nThe Barnstormers may be very<br />\nproud of having closed the season<br />\n<br />\nWith a good show.<br />\n<br />\n\"Played Switch\"<br />\n\"After that we got lumber<br />\nfrom the construction and built<br />\na rail fence across the road.<br />\nWhen a car came up we ran, and<br />\nI lost a loafer. But it was only a<br />\ncouple of seniors. We then<br />\nstarted playing switch with the<br />\ncars in the parking lot.\"<br />\n\"All the cars with unlocked<br />\ndoors were in trouble, because it<br />\nwas easy to release the emergency brake and push them. Two<br />\nwere pushed to the entrance of<br />\nthe lot so it was blocked off<br />\ncompletely. Another car was exchanged for fifteen milk cans<br />\nwhich we lined up on the wall<br />\nin front of the old dorms.\"<br />\n\"Next we pushed a Nash up to<br />\nthe new dorms, hoping to get it<br />\ninto the Snack Bar. It wouldn't<br />\nfit, so we left it blocking the<br />\nmain door. Finally we left some<br />\nlounge furniture on the lawn<br />\nlooking like an abandoned tea<br />\nparty, and decorated the tee&<br />\nwith toilet paper.<br />\n\"It was about 4 o'clock and<br />\ngetting light, so we broke up.

Perhaps this is due<br />\nmerely to the success of our educational system.\"<br />\nLearning for learning's sake<br />\nwas at first too visionary and<br />\nimpractical for our educational<br />\nsystem.

This I applaud. Tree-sitting is healthful and jolly and as American as<br />\napple pie. Also it keeps you off the streets.<br />\nTree-sitting is not, however, without its hazards. Take, for<br />\nexample, the dread and chilling case of Manuel Sigafoos and<br />\nEd Sweeney, both sophomores at the Nashville College of Folk<br />\nMusic and Woodworking, and both madly in love with a beautiful alto named Ursula Thing, who won their hearts singing<br />\nthat fine old folk song, I Strangled My True Love with Her Own<br />\nYellow Braids, and I'll Never Eat Her Sorghum Any More.<br />\nBoth Manuel and Ed pressed Ursula to go steady, but she<br />\ncould not choose between them, and finally it was decided that<br />\nthe boys would have a tree-sitting contest, and Ursula would<br />\nbelong to the victor. So Manuel and Ed clambered up adjoining aspens, taking with them the following necessaries: food,<br />\nclothing, bedding, reading matter, and\u2014most essential of all\u2014<br />\nplenty of Marlboro Cigarettes.<br />\nWe who live on the ground know how much you get to like<br />\nith a Marlboro.

Obviously<br />\nforewarned by an informer, a<br />\nGoucher campus policeman had<br />\nblocked the main entrance with<br />\na paddy wagon and brilliant red<br />\nflare. After inspecting each car<br />\nwith a flashlight, he told each<br />\ndriver in no uncertain terms to<br />\n\"get on back and don't try anything.\"<br />\nHowever, as evidenced by the<br />\nvan -colored filmy trophies later<br />\ndisplayed by a large number of<br />\nHopkins residents, the onslaught<br />\nwas not quite so unsuccessful as<br />\nhoped. A number of excited<br />\nstudents told how, after parking<br />\ntheir cars, they had approached<br />\nthe<br />\ncampus<br />\nundiscovered<br />\nthrough<br />\nwooded<br />\nareas and<br />\nreached the dormitories, gaining<br />\nentrance by breaking windows<br />\nor pushing through doors<br />\n\"It was easy,\" exclaimed one<br />\nof the raiders, later brandishing<br />\nhis prize with leopard-skin pattern and the head of a tiger<br />\nglaring stoically from the front.<br />\nHe reported that he and many<br />\nof his cohorts were readily admitted through dormitory win-<br /><br />\ndows by \"anxious and willing\"<br />\n\"Some<br />\nof<br />\nfemales.<br />\nthem<br />\nscreamed, but most of them<br />\ndidn't mind.

Each night while Manuel<br />\ndozed on his bough, one of Ed's brothers\u2014Fred or Jed\u2014would<br />\nsneak up the tree and replace him. \"How can I lose?\" said Ed<br />\nwith a fiendish giggle to his brother Fred or Jed.<br />\nBut Ed had a big surprise coming. For Manuel, though<br />\nhe did not know it himself, was a druid! He had been abandoned<br />\nas an infant at the hut of a poor and humble woodcutter named<br />\nCornelius Whitney Sigafoos III, who had raised the child as<br />\nhis own. So when Manuel got into the tree, he found much to<br />\nhis surprise that he had never in all his life felt so at home<br />\nand happy. He had absolutely no intention of ever leaving.<br />\nAfter seven or eight years Ed and his brothers wearied of the<br />\ncontest and conceded. Ursula Thing came to NIanuel's tree<br />\nand cried, \"I am yours! Come down and pin me!!<br />\nBut Manuel declined. Instead he asked Ursula to join him<br />\nin the tree.

A series of concentrated<br />\nefforts by a comparatively small<br />\ngroup of Hopkins students resulted in complete disruption of<br />\nthe area between Gilman Hall<br />\nand the dormitories.<br />\nOne of the participants in<br />\nFriday's early-morning shncligs<br />\nat Homewood gave this report:<br />\n\"The whole thing was a spurof-the moment affair, The only<br />\nthing we planned were the zeeds.<br />\nSomebody got the idea while<br />\nwatching the tractor plow up the<br />\nlawns in front of the dorms to<br />\nplant a garden where grass was<br />\nsupposed to grow.

Charley's Aunt,<br />\nBrandon Thomas' popular theatrical warhorse, served to redeem the Barnstormers from<br />\nwhat would otherwise have been<br />\na season fraught with poor productions.<br />\nAt the risk of filling this review with superlatives, I must<br />\nadmit that the production was<br />\nexcellent. The acting was, without exception, quite good. The<br />\nsets, which were magnificently<br />\nexecuted, bore witness to the<br />\nhard work and time which went<br />\ninto their construction.<br />\nPlays To The Hilt<br />\nThe overall success of the play,<br />\nhowever, I would attribute to the<br />\ndirection by Lester Wolf. He is<br />\na master of the \"light touch\"<br />\nand is particularly successful<br />\nin directing comedy. His many<br />\nyears of acting and directing experience in the field of comedy<br />\nenabled him to make the element<br />\nof slapstick, with which the play<br />\nabounds, artful. I feel that without Mr. Wolf's guiding hand, the<br />\ntemptation to play up crudity<br />\nand slapstick would have proven<br />\ntoo much for the Barnstormers<br />\nto handle.<br />\nMichael Dale, incoming president of the Barnstormers, was<br />\nmuch more relaxed and animated<br />\nin the role of Jack Chesney than<br /><br />\nhe had been in his lamentable<br />\nperformance in Doctor's Dilemma a couple of months ago. Dennis Donahue, as Charley, did<br />\neverything the role demanded of<br />\nhim. Dan Tracy, as Brasset (not<br />\nBrassety, gentlemen) was con-<br /><br />\nvincing.<br />\nDavid Hochberg, as Charley's<br />\naunt, complete with long black<br />\ndress and wig, played his part to<br />\nthe hilt. His very expressive face<br />\nand his ability to do a \"double<br />\ntake\" greatly enhanced his performance. We particularly enjoyed the fiendish gleam in his<br />\neye when, in accepting a rose<br />\nfrom one of his \"admirers\", he<br />\nproclaimed, \"I'll have it stuffed!\"<br />\nMary Scheller, Mary Waesche,<br />\nJohn Gartland, Bill Bevans,<br />\nNancy Berendt, and Pat Lynch<br />\nwere the other members of this<br />\nfine cast.<br />\nApplaud Proposal<br />\nPerhaps the finest tribute to<br />\nthe acting ability of the Barnstormers came during the scene<br />\nbetween Michael Dale and Mary<br />\nScheller.
