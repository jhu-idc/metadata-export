The<br />\nHopkins Ultraviolet Telescope<br />\nwill examine sources of<br />\nultraviolet light in various<br />\nregions of space.<br />\nAccording to Davidsen,<br />\n\"HUT is unique because it can<br />\nextremely<br />\nshort<br />\ndetect<br />\nultraviolet wavelengths and<br />\ntherefore allows us to see the<br />\nwhole spectrum.\" HUT was<br />\nconceived, designed, and built<br />\nby Hopkins scientists and<br />\nengineers at Homewood and<br />\nPhysics<br />\nApplied<br />\nthe<br />\nLaboratory.<br />\nResearch at the new Center<br />\nalso includes the study of observations made with the Hubble<br />\nSpace Telescope. This telescope<br />\nwill be operated by the Space<br />\nTelescope Science Institute, an<br />\nindependent organization<br />\nlocated at Homewood, made<br />\nup of members from 17 different universities.

The third major<br />\narea of study will be groundbased astronomy, the examination of data from surface<br />\ntelescopes.<br />\nDavidsen commented saying,<br />\n\"The combination of research<br />\nin space astronomy, in groundbased astronomy, and in<br />\n<br />\ntheoretical astrophysics should<br />\nmake the Johns Hopkins<br />\nHomewood Campus one of the<br />\nmost stimulating places in the<br />\nworld.\"<br />\nAccording to Davidsen, there<br />\nare several opportunities for<br />\nundergraduates to participate in<br />\nthe Center.

Mintz was<br />\nthe topic of this week's<br />\nWednesday Noon Series, in the<br />\nGarrett Room of the MSE<br />\nLibrary.<br />\nMintz, The William L.<br />\nStrauss Jr. Professor of Anthropology at Hopkins, has<br />\nreceived national attention for<br />\nhis most recent book,<br />\nSweetness and Power: The<br />\nPlace of Sugar in Modern<br />\nHistory.\" In the book he<br />\ndiscusses today's fast paced<br />\neating habits and how the<br />\nhistory of sugar during the last<br />\n300 years has affected the<br />\ndevelopment of convenience<br />\nfoods.<br />\nAfter being introduced by<br />\nSherry Gill, Director of the Office of Special Events, Mintz introduced his talk as really an<br />\nafterthought to the more<br />\nhistorical perspective of his<br />\nbook.<br />\n\"Sugar is only an idiom for<br />\nlarger changes in society,\"<br />\nMintz commented, discussing<br />\nthe wholesale alteration of<br />\nAmerican eating habits. He<br />\nadded \"Over one-third of every<br />\nfood dollar is spent on food<br />\nconsumed outside the home,<br />\nand the total national amount<br />\nspent in eating establishments<br />\nhas increased 500 percent in the<br />\nlast 16 years.\"<br />\nIn addition, he said that the<br />\nvariety of prepared foods to be<br />\neaten in the home is increasing<br />\nas well. \"You can buy Veal<br />\nOreganata, and Veal Marsala in<br />\nDiet Gourmet sections of the<br />\n<br />\nfrozen food aisle of your<br />\nfavorite supermarket and both<br />\ntaste exactly the same.\"<br />\nThe increased consumption<br />\nof sugar, he continued, is a<br />\nreflection of the addition of<br />\nmore and more processed foods<br />\nto the diet. \"If consumption is<br />\nmorally good, then more consumption is morally better,\" he<br />\ncommented, noting that purchase of processed items such<br />\nas soft drinks have risen 78 percent in the last few years. \"It's<br />\na wonder why Wienberger left<br />\nhis job at Pepsi-Cola to take a<br />\nlittle job in the Defense Department,\" Mintz remarked.<br />\nThe reason that consumption<br />\nof sugar parallels consumption<br />\nof processed foods, Mintz said,<br />\nis because some form of sugar<br />\n(cane, beet or corn) is used in<br />\nvirtually every packaged food<br />\navailable. \"Sugar is even used<br />\nin foods that don't taste<br />\n<br />\nsweet,\" he said, noting that<br />\n\"Shake and Bake [a fried<br />\nchicken coating] is 52 percent<br />\nsucrose!\"<br />\nSugar<br />\nadds<br />\n\"tenderness\" to bread,\"body\"<br />\nto soda, shelf-life to countless<br />\nfoods, and even helps in the<br />\n\"go-away\" of peanut butter\u2014<br />\nthe more sugar in the peanut<br />\nbutter, the less it sticks to the<br />\nroof of your mouth.<br />\nIt's all a reflection of the<br />\nperceived \"pressure\" of not<br />\nenough time in our society,<br />\nMintz said, noting that \"We<br />\ncombine consumptions\u2014<br />\npopcorn with a movie, drihking<br />\nwith driving, etc.\" Processed<br />\nfoods, Mintz concluded, add to<br />\nthe image of gaining \"maximum pleasure in the minimum<br />\ntime like watching the Cowboys<br />\nplay the Steelers while eating<br />\nfritos, while smoking a joint,<br />\nwith your girlfriend on your<br />\nlap\u2014that's living!\"<br />\n<br />\nuanesn tiamacnanocan<br />\n<br />\nSidney W.

That figure is<br />\nbased on someone staying here for Intersession, which doesn't cost any extra<br />\nunder the meal plan. Since most of the<br />\npeople on the meal plan are freshmen,<br />\nhowever, few stay here during January.<br />\nAnd if you don't count Intersession, a<br />\nstudent on the 14-meal plan would have<br />\nto eat\u2014get this-106.8 percent of his<br />\nmeals to save any money. How one is<br />\nsupposed to eat more meals than one has<br />\npaid for remains to be explained,<br />\nIn fairness, we probably ought to mention that the figures are a little more rational for the 19-meal-a-week plan. If<br />\nyou stay for Intersession on that plan,<br />\nfor example, you only have to eat 81.1<br />\npercent of your meals to save money\u2014<br />\nnot too difficult. If you don't stay for<br />\nIntersession, the figure goes up to 88<br />\npercent\u2014a little less likely but not<br />\nimpossible.<br />\n<br />\nIf freshmen were allowed to simply<br />\nforego the meal plan, none of this would<br />\nbe so bad. But in fact all freshmen (and<br />\neverybody else living in the dorms, for<br />\nthat matter) are required to buy one of<br />\nthe plans, whether they want it or not.<br />\nConsidering that the university is responsible for that restriction, it is surely also<br />\na responsibility of the administration to<br />\ninsure a rational plan is offered.<br />\nThis is all quite important just now<br />\nbecause the current contract with ARA<br />\nexpires this year. A food committee has<br />\nbeen formed to examine bids from<br />\nvarious companies. So even though<br />\nstudents will apparently have to suffer<br />\nthrough the spring semester with a<br />\nridiculous meal plan, perhaps the situation can be remedied for next year. In<br />\nparticular (and in ascending order of<br />\nauthority), Bettye Miller, director of auxilliary enterprises, Norman Krueger,<br />\nassociate dean for administrative services, and Robert Welch, dean of administration, should be careful to avoid<br />\nrepeating the mistakes of the past. (It<br />\nmight also be noted that it is Miller and<br />\nKrueger who are chiefly responsible for<br />\nthe current nonsense.)<br />\nThere can be no argument that this<br />\nyear's meal plan has labored under a<br />\nludicrous pricing scheme. There isn't<br />\nmuch that can be done about that now,<br />\nbut the administration ought to make<br />\nsure that a little common sense is<br />\nemployed in the future.<br />\n<br />\nSnap Judgements<br />\nThere is a tendency on the part of<br />\nstudents to be impatient. They are here,<br />\nafter all, only four years, and so they<br />\noften rush to rather quick judgements.<br />\nThat is certainly true of new administrators. When George Fisher was<br />\nappointed Dean of the School of Arts<br />\nand Sciences three years ago, students interested in such things were already calling him a failure or a success(depending<br />\non their views) by the end of the first<br />\nsemester. That's certainly understandable, but it's equally regrettable. It really takes at least two years in any new job<br />\nto get to know your way around the<br />\nplace.(That isn't to say that nothing can<br />\nbe accomplished in the first few months<br />\nof a new dean's tenure; merely that a<br />\nthorough analysis of how good a dean,<br />\nor provost, or president, so-and-so has<br />\nbeen can only be reached after an examination of his performance over<br />\nseveral years.)<br />\nUnfortunately, people seem to be<br />\nmaking the same snap judgements now<br />\nwith the newest dean\u2014Robert Welch,<br />\nthe dean of administration. Already,<br />\nsome folks are arguing about how good<br />\na job he has done. That fact is, though,<br />\nthat no one has any idea how well Welch<br />\nwill do his job (or, for that matter, how<br />\nwell the new structure of which he is the<br />\nmajor component will function). But<br />\nwhile it's too soon to form an opinion<br />\non Welch, people ought to keep an eye<br />\n<br />\non him, for rarely has a rookie been<br />\nthrown so many interesting issues. Those<br />\nissues were on display at a recent Student<br />\nCouncil meeting, when Welch talked<br />\nwith the council on a variety of things.<br />\nIn particular, student housing poses a<br />\nmajor problem for Welch. The university plans to renovate (and possibly expand) its current housing, and exactly<br />\nwhat those renovations ought to entail<br />\nremains an open question. The issue<br />\nclearly goes beyond technical questions<br />\nof when the renovations ought to be<br />\ndone and what the refurbished buildings<br />\nought to look like. The university has a<br />\nchance to change the nature of student<br />\nhousing at Hopkins. Should the new versions of Wolman and McCoy be closer<br />\nto traditional dormitories, for example?<br />\nOn an even more general level, should<br />\nuniversity-owned housing present a more<br />\ncollegiate atmosphere? (We're by no<br />\nmeans suggesting that it should; we'll<br />\nwithhold judgement on that for a while.<br />\nWe're just pointing out that a rare opportunity exists to address these<br />\nquestions.)<br />\nWelch also has several other major<br />\nproblems to deal with\u2014renovations of<br />\nGilman, admissions problems and financial aid questions all come to mind. Considering he has been at Hopkins less than<br />\nfour months, dealing with those issues<br />\nis a lot to ask. How Welch does the rest<br />\nof the year should prove interesting.<br />\n<br />\nThe professor turned to us<br />\nand smiled. \"Now, this is important if you are ever going to<br />\nbe a doctor and drive a<br />\nMercedes-Benz.\"<br />\nSome subdued laughter<br />\nrippled through the audience,<br />\nand I smiled even though it was<br />\nthe tenth time that I had heard<br />\na Hopkins professor make a<br />\ndisparaging remark about the<br />\n<br />\nhappens to want to become a<br />\ndoctor. The former case is a<br />\ngross distortion of what college<br />\nshould be. It lowers the college<br />\neducation to the level of a<br />\nperiod of wait before medical<br />\nschool, or as an intensive<br />\nMCAT preparations program<br />\nof some sort where one can<br />\ngarner more extra curriculars.<br />\nThe concept of a liberal educa-<br />\n<br />\njoe chen<br />\ntypical Hopkins natural science<br />\nstudent.<br />\nWhat the professor said<br />\nreflects, however, the typical<br />\nperception of the pre-medical<br />\nstudent. It reflects tarnished<br />\nideals, and a pragmatism on<br />\nMachiavellian proportions. It<br />\nreflects the self-imposed competitiveness and single dimensionality that people perceive<br />\npre-medical students to<br />\nembody.<br />\nAlthough this is for the most<br />\npart untrue, it does indicate a<br />\ntrend among some students in<br />\ntheir zeal to gain a place in a<br />\nmedical institution. These<br />\nstudents have seemed to have<br />\nlost touch with the purpose of<br />\na college education.<br />\nWhat the problem essentially boils down to are people who<br />\nput being a premed ahead of<br />\nbeing a college student studying<br />\nwhatever field he is happening<br />\nto study. One must not regard<br />\nhimself as a premed who happens to be, for example a<br />\nbiology undergrad, but rather<br />\nas a biology undergrad who<br />\n<br />\ntion is lost, and although<br />\ntechnically competent people<br />\nare created, many areinept as<br />\nhumans.<br />\nA few schools of medicine<br />\nhave recognized this problem,<br />\nand have sought solutions to<br />\nthis problem by trying to diversify the backgrounds of their<br />\ncandidates. The Hopkins<br />\nSchool of Medicine, as is well<br />\nknown, has dropped the<br />\nMCAT as a requirement for<br />\ntheir applicants. Yet, programs<br />\nsuch as these have been limited<br />\nin their efficacy from the standpoint of deemphasizing the<br />\ncompetitiveness and technical<br />\norientation of the premedical<br />\nstudent. In addition, it seems<br />\nsometimes as though what these<br />\nschools of medicine are saying<br />\nis vastly different from what<br />\nthey are actually doing, which<br />\nmakes their attempts at reforming the system appear to be<br />\nmore gesture and encouragement than action.

Do not tell me that this<br />\nnew injustice would correct a<br />\npast wrong.\"<br />\nWhat I want to tell you, Mr.<br />\nLevy and Ms. Hamel, is that<br />\nthe \"past wrong\" is not past.<br />\nIf people were hired \"solely on<br />\nmerit\" today, affirmative action would be unnecessary, and<br />\nacademia itself (not just the<br />\nsupport staff) would have equal<br />\nnumbers of male and female<br />\nemployees. Unfortunately, sexual discrimination in hiring is<br />\nstill with us. As evidence, I<br />\nwould like to quote from a<br />\nPsychology Today (November<br />\n1984, p.14) article entitled<br />\n\"Academia-Still<br />\na<br />\nMale<br />\nPreserve.\" In \"an experiment in<br />\nwhich heads of 'departments<br />\nwere sent identical resumes with<br />\neither a male or female name,<br />\nthe 'male name' applicants<br />\nwere judged as meriting the<br />\nrank of associate professor,<br />\nwhile the same resumes from<br />\n'female' applicants caused them<br />\nto be rated as suitable for the<br />\nlower rank of assistant proIf anyone disputes<br />\nfessor...<br />\nthese findings, he or she may<br />\nget them verified by a tenured<br />\nfemale faculty member at<br />\nHopkins, provided one can be<br />\nfound!<br />\nObviously, hiring should be<br />\nbased \"solely on merit\",<br />\nregardless of gender, or race, or<br />\nreligion, for that matter. But<br />\nuntil this happens (if it ever<br />\ndoes), affirmative action is<br />\nnecessary.<br />\nLinda Carrublm<br />\n<br />\n\f10/NOVEMBER 8, 1985<br />\n<br />\nFeatures<br />\nThe Atomic Cinematographer: Richard Chisolm<br />\nby Sujata Banerjee<br />\nWhen Richard Chisolm takes<br />\nthe stage in his Atomic Cinema<br />\nof course, something funny<br />\nhappens.<br />\nThe twenty-eight-year old<br />\ncinematographer with long<br />\nblond hair and a slight<br />\nresemblance to Tom Petty<br />\ngestures casually, but strides<br />\nwith a lanky impatience. He<br />\ncracks jokes about the films<br />\nand the students, and won't<br />\nstop short of a dance contest,<br />\njust for the hell of it.<br />\nBetween laughs, the talk is of<br />\nnuclear annihilation, camera<br />\nshots, and death. The audience<br />\ngoes silent as a student tries to<br />\nexplain what dying would mean<br />\nto him. Chisolm relaxes, temporarily. They're on track.<br />\nClose to 200 students turn up<br />\neach week for his class,<br />\nalthough there is no roll call or<br />\nfinal exam. They come to watch<br />\nthe movies, and to watch<br />\nChisolm blur the line between<br />\nentertainment and reality.<br />\n\"The topic is real hot,\"<br />\nChisolm says, shrugging deeper<br />\ninto his black leather jacket, as<br />\nhe tries to explain the course's<br />\nsuccess. \"The material is very<br />\nhardcore because it deals with<br />\na lot of fears people have, or<br />\nhave tried to deny.. .\"<br />\n\"I've tried to create a free environment with a sense of spontaneity and the present.

He began<br />\nby teaching a film-making<br />\ncourse in the humanities<br />\ndepartment. Around the time<br />\nthe adminstration shifted all<br />\nfilm courses into the writing<br />\nseminars, Chisolm, who says he<br />\nhas an \"allergy to redundance,\" changed his basic<br />\ntechnical course into a<br />\ndocumentary film survey. The<br />\ncourse was fun enough for him<br />\nto run it again, exploring a different topic in film each<br />\nsemester.<br />\nChisolm was a 15-year-old<br />\nstudent at Catonsville High<br />\nSchool when he picked up a<br />\nSuper-8 camera for the first<br />\ntime.<br />\n\"I was a really immature and<br />\ncrazy high school kid,\" he says.<br />\n\"I would get high with my<br />\nfriends and make trick films,<br />\nfilms which animated our<br />\nbodies across parking lots and<br />\nopen fields.\"<br />\nChisolm is the son of Elise T.<br />\nChisolm, the syndicated Evening Sun columnist. She has the<br />\nsame long-boned, easy grace as<br />\nher son, and the same<br />\nmischievous eyes under her<br />\ngray curls. She has weird<br />\nmemories of Richard's first<br />\nfilm.<br />\n\"He's the craziest,\" she said.<br />\n\"He has a real National Lampoon sense of humor. For his<br />\nvery first film, he went into my<br />\ndrawer and did an animation of<br />\nmy electric curlers, made them<br />\ndance around.\"<br />\nChisolm moved`on to study<br />\ncinematography at UMBC.<br />\nWhile he took classes, he made<br />\n16-millimeter films for local<br />\ncharities, and began getting<br />\npaid for work on commercials<br />\nand documentaries.<br />\nIn 1979 Chisolm made<br />\nMuseum. The 30-minute<br />\ncinema verite piece went behind<br />\nthe scenes at the Walters Art<br />\nGallery. Chisolm made the film<br />\non a $12,000 budget, but says<br />\nit looked like $50,000 because<br />\nhe borrowed his camera equipment from school, and had free<br />\n<br />\nassistance from friends. A year<br />\nlater, P.B.S. acquired the film<br />\nand began showing it on T.V.<br />\nAfter getting a B.A.,<br />\nChisolm began working as a<br />\nfreelance photographer.<br />\n\"I just lived by my phone<br />\nlike a fireman,\" he said. \"I'd<br />\nget calls to film toasters for<br />\ncommercials, or to make<br />\nmovies in Central America or<br />\nEurope.\"<br />\nChisolm has specifics about<br />\nthe kind of commercials he will<br />\nand will not do. He has turned<br />\ndown jobs on propaganda films<br />\nfor the U.S. military which<br />\ncould have earned him<br />\nthousands of dollars. He also<br />\nwouldn't make commercials for<br />\nNestle, Inc., if they asked,<br />\nbecause of their marketing<br />\npolicy in the Third World.<br />\nChisolm is trying to raise<br />\n$100,000 for a new documentary film. It's rough going in a<br />\nfield which likes to follow the<br />\nnorm.

My friend<br />\nBasil and I, over the past summer, joined a band of idealistic<br />\nrevolutionaries. I must admit,<br />\nthough, that I was skeptical<br />\nwhen Basil first came to me<br />\nwith the idea. \"I thought we<br />\nwere going to Florida,\" I said,<br />\ntrying on a pair of sporty<br />\nsunglasses. \"New Jersey? Are<br />\nyou sure they're liberals?\"<br />\n\"Are you kidding?\" Basil<br />\nassured me. \"These guys<br />\nhaven't even seen 'Beverly Hills<br />\nCop'.\" I knew then that if it<br />\nwere an iconoclastic group I<br />\nwas looking for, I had come to<br />\nthe right place.<br />\nThese radicals were clever.<br />\n<br />\nNo one would ever have<br />\nthought to look for a revolutionary's headquarters in the<br />\nsuburbs. When we got there, we<br />\nwere greeted by Dmitri, our<br />\nleader. There were quick introductions, and I struck up a<br />\nconversation with Emily, a<br />\nnosy feminist from Bryn Mawr<br />\nwith long black hair and wire<br />\nrimmed glasses.\"Do you<br />\nbelieve in the E.R.A?\" she asked me.\"Sure,\" I said. She muttered something that sounded<br />\nlike \"Derivative, totally<br />\nderivative\" and walked away.<br />\nI was in love.<br />\nDmitri gathered us all around<br />\nthe projection T.V. and revealed the secret demands we would<br />\nprotest: demands which would<br />\nchange America forever. \"We<br />\nwant to abolish sales tax on the<br />\nnecessary foods: meats,<br />\n<br />\npoultry, fruits and all.\" I looked Dmitri in the eye and broke<br />\nthe news to him: \"There isn't<br />\nany tax on those items.\" When<br />\nhe heard this, Dmitri frowned<br />\npensively, then shot his arms up<br />\ninto the air. \"Hurrah!\" he<br />\nroared. That night was spent in<br />\na victory celebration.<br />\nDuring the course of the party I learned a few things. One,<br />\nDmitri's only leadership experience had been as vicepresident of the local Parker<br />\nStevenson fan club. Two, every<br />\none of the liberals besides Basil<br />\nand myself had at one time<br />\nbeen members of the Parker<br />\nStevenson fan club. Three,<br />\nEmily refused to commit<br />\nherself to any emotional involvement so long as the<br />\nE.R.A. was ignored. I proposed a number of alternatives to<br />\n<br />\nemotional involvement, the last<br />\nof which was answered by a<br />\nslap in the face.<br />\nOver the next few days we<br />\ntalked about a new cause to<br />\norganize into protests and<br />\nrallies. I suggested a protest<br />\nagainst higher education, but it<br />\nwas thought too conservative.<br />\nAs the days dragged on, Basil<br />\nand I began to have our doubts.<br />\nFinally, Basil spoke up. \"I<br />\nheard somewhere that Parker<br />\nStevenson voted Republican.\"<br />\nThere was a violent debate,<br />\nand, I must admit, some<br />\nshedding of tears, but the outcome was momentous. Dmitri<br />\nand ourselves were going to denounce Parker Stevenson and<br />\nboycott the East Rutherford<br />\nbranch of his national fan club.<br />\nI suggested writing fiery letters<br />\nto the local paper, but it was<br />\n<br />\nthought too conservative. Basil<br />\nthought it would be best if we<br />\nspray-painted slanderous<br />\nremarks about Stevenson on<br />\nthe sides of buildings. The<br />\ngroup spent two nights doing<br />\nthis, and I suggested that in<br />\ncelebration of our victorious<br />\nprotest we get drunk, but it was<br />\nthought too conservative. Basil<br />\nended up leading us in a conga<br />\nline around the bonfire.<br />\nLiberalism is not dead. And<br />\nmay it never die, for without it<br />\nAmerica would still have the<br />\nsame values it had fifty years<br />\nago, the rich would get richer<br />\nand the poor poorer, and<br />\nmilitary strength would be<br />\nfavored over proper education.<br />\nAnd Emily has asked me to<br />\ntake her to see \"Beverly Hills<br />\nCop.\" But I thought it too<br />\nconservative.<br

/>\nby Peter Oehlkers<br />\nWhat is this \"spirit of rock<br />\n'n roll\" business? Is it really, as<br />\n98-Rock would have us believe,<br />\na bunch of long-haired guitar<br />\n\"heroes\" indulging themselves<br />\non a ten-foot stage in front of<br />\na huge mass of groveling<br />\nfanatics? Or is it, rather, a four<br />\npiece grinding out three-chord<br />\nthrash on a tiny two-foot stage<br />\nencompassed by a hot, sweaty,<br />\ncramped, hoppin' dance floor<br />\nin a hot, sweaty, cramped, hoppin' barroom down in the<br />\ndepths of the city, i.e. Richard<br />\nTaylor and the Ravers.<br />\n\"I consider Rock 'n Roll<br />\nmusic dance music. It's music<br />\nto dance to,\" says singerguitarist-song writer Richard<br />\nTaylor, and if that statement is<br />\na true indication of the rock 'n<br />\nroll spirit of the Ravers,<br />\ntonight's Senior Class Party in<br />\nthe Glass Pavilioa ought to be<br />\nthe place to be (you can save<br />\nBachelor Party til Saturday).<br />\nThe Ravers play what is<br />\nusually termed \"traditional<br />\nroots based\" rock 'n roll, according to Taylor. In other<br />\nwords, mid-60's rock with a<br />\ngood deal of scruffy slide blues,<br />\ncountry and western, and traditional pop thrown in for good<br />\nmeasure. They are not a cover<br />\nband, however, even though<br />\nthey play a lot of old Chuck<br />\nBerry, Buddy Holly, and Rolling Stones tunes. Taylor's<br />\noriginal songs make the band<br />\nwhat it is\u2014he quotes the<br />\nStones, Beatles and Bob Dylan<br />\n(of the mid-60's, not the later<br />\npsychedelic era) as his greatest<br />\ninfluences. Also, although they<br />\nplay songs by Gene Vincent and<br />\nother 50's rockers, Taylor is<br />\nquick to point out that they are<br />\nnot a \"rock-a-billy\" band\u2014a<br />\nlabel which tends to be quite<br />\nlimiting.<br />\nThe Ravers consist of<br />\nRichard Taylor on guitar, Neil<br />\nDissinger on bass, Matt<br />\nMaschal behind the drum kit,<br />\nand JHU's own senior English<br />\nmajor and guitarist, Bob Kannenberg. They will celebrate<br />\ntheir third year together next<br />\nFebruary. Taylor himself,<br />\nhowever, has a long history of<br />\nplaying in Baltimore. He was in<br />\nZen Archer, a very popular<br />\nBaltimore band of a few years<br />\nago, a band which Taylor says<br />\nwas louder, more Stoney, early Aerosmith-style rock and roll<br />\nwith as many hooks per pound<br />\nas possible.\" He emphasizes<br />\nthat then as now his band was<br />\nno place for guitar heroics, few<br />\nof the songs being longer than<br />\nthree minutes.<br />\nAfter Zen Archer broke up,<br />\nTaylor recorded a four song<br />\nsolo EP, on the basis of which<br />\nWeasel of WHFS has called<br />\nRichard Taylor and the Ravers<br />\nhis favorite band. The band<br />\nitself has put out a ten-song<br />\ncassette called Rave-On and a<br />\nsix-song EP titled This Side Up<br />\nis due to be released in three to<br />\nfour weeks. So far the critical<br />\n<br />\nDriven by energetic music<br />\ndirector Catherine Overhauser,<br />\nthe Hopkins Symphony Orchestra launched its fifth and<br />\nmost auspicious season yet last<br />\nSunday afternoon in Shriver<br />\nHall with a performance of fine<br />\nViennese works.<br />\nThough a bit awkwardly executed, the concert provided a<br />\nglimpse of this on the whole<br />\npromising group of musicians,<br />\nand offered a preview of the<br />\ncaliber of guest artists that the<br />\norchestra has managed to attract this season.<br />\nThe program began with the<br />\nOverture to Fidelio, Op. 72, by<br />\nLudwig van Beethoven. The<br />\nhistory of Fidelio, Beethoven's<br />\nonly opera, reveals that it took<br />\nthe composer four separate<br />\nwritings of the overture, all of<br />\nwhich were quite different, to<br />\ncreate the proper theatrical<br />\nquality in the piece which<br />\nwould please his friends and<br />\ncritics.<br />\nThe orchestra's french horn,<br />\nwhich is featured in the opening of the piece, but couldn't<br />\nquite accomplish the full, glowing tone finally intended by<br />\nBeethoven, and the violins<br />\n<br />\nseemed a bit tentative in their<br />\naccompaniment. Yet when the<br />\nwhole orchestra was given entrance, their confidence<br />\nmarkedly increased.<br />\nThe second piece performed<br />\nwas Haydn's Symphony No.<br />\n101 in D Major, subtitled \"The<br />\nClock\" for the bright \"ticking\"<br />\nfigure tossed about the orchestra in the second movement<br />\nwhich resembles the timekeeping of a venerable pendule. The<br />\nfirst movement opened with a<br />\n\"mysterious and misty\" section\u2014perhaps influenced by the<br />\nambience of London where<br />\nHaydn wrote the symphony\u2014<br />\nand this, too, proved challenging for the upper strings.<br />\nIn the second movement the<br />\n\"clock\" figure was initiated by<br />\nthe lower strings and the bassoon in a measured, slightly<br />\nhumorous fashion. The flute<br />\nthen took up the figure and<br />\ncontinued it with such clarity<br />\nand consistency that if one closed one's eyes, the conjured image of a fantastic and<br />\nmelodious timepiece was not<br />\neasily suppressed.<br />\nThe third movement with its<br />\npretentious style and subverting<br />\nContinued on Page 14<br />\n<br />\nWall of Voodoo<br />\nin Sammystown<br />\nby Sue Trowbridge<br />\nWall of Voodoo<br />\nSeven Days in Sammystown<br />\n(I.R.S.

As<br />\nno one ever got a record contract playing around Baltimore,<br />\nthe band is relying on massive<br />\nshipments of demo tapes to get<br />\nmajor label interest. Recently,<br />\nSlash, the large independent<br />\nlabel in Los Angeles has expressed interest in them.<br />\n<br />\nBaltimore-born John Doe of<br />\nthe band X, which started on<br />\nSlash Records, has said that<br />\nBaltimore is a great place to be<br />\ninspired by but a lousy place to<br />\nhave any rock success. Richard<br />\nTaylor agrees: \"I'm inspired by<br />\ncities\u2014I get inspiration for<br />\nsongs from street people and<br />\nclub people\u2014just the way they<br />\nlook.\"<br />\nBut he accepts the fact that<br />\nBaltimore is not an original<br />\nband town. With the closings of<br />\nthe Marble Bar, Trenton Street<br />\nStop, and the Baltimore Pub<br />\nthere are barely any places in<br />\nBaltimcfre to play anymore.<br />\nThey've resorted to playing<br />\nBackstreets Cafe in Towson<br />\nand at numerous Phi Psi<br />\nparties\u2014which Taylor says are<br />\na \"blast every time.\" But even<br />\nGirards, once a bastion for<br />\nlocal talent, has been reduced to<br />\n\"assisting\" people tuck in their<br />\nshirt-tails. Responds Richard<br />\nTaylor:\"We don't worry about<br />\nour shirt-tails.\" That statement<br />\nalone ought to tell you in whose<br />\nheart the spirit of rock 'n roll<br />\nreally resides.<br />\n<br />\nIt's quite surprising to see<br />\nthat Wall of Voodoo is back.<br />\nAfter all, they lost their major<br />\nasset\u2014Stan Ridgway's deadpan<br />\nvoice, so perfectly droll on<br />\nVoodoo favorites like \"Back in<br />\n\"Mexican<br />\nand<br />\nFlesh\"<br />\nRadio\"\u2014when Ridgway left<br />\nthe band to pursue a solo<br />\ncareer.<br />\nSeven Days in Sammystown<br />\nisn't the bust it could have<br />\nbeen, considering that only two<br />\noriginal members remain.<br />\nDespite that, the new Voodoo<br />\ntry hard to recreate that one-ofa-kind sound perfected when<br />\nRidgway was at the helm\u2014<br />\nmusic for an urban cowboy's<br />\nHalloween hoedown.

Alternatively, picture<br />\nDevo if they had grown up in<br />\nArizona instead of Akron.<br />\nSammystown plays up the<br />\nmore marketable rock side of<br />\nVoodoo's music.

Still, he's not<br />\nbad; he just had a very hard act<br />\nto follow.<br />\nPrieboy doesn't have much<br />\nto work with, either, since the<br />\n<br />\nlyrics are strictly from banal<br />\ncity\u2014\"This business of love<br />\nwill never do, not for me and<br />\nnot for you/This business of<br />\nlove will never die, not for you<br />\nand not for 1,\" goes one<br />\nchorus.<br />\nWall of Voodoo have some<br />\ncatchy tracks here\u2014the eerie<br />\n\"Mona,\" the frenetic \"Room<br />\nwith a View.\" Still Sammystown isn't entirely satisfying, and some of it is downright<br />\nlackluster, like \"Blackboard<br />\nSky,\" a plodding rocker.<br />\nMaybe the spectre of Ridgway<br />\nneeds to be exorcised, so the<br />\nnew Voodoo can come into its<br />\nown.

While one might expect<br />\nMartin Scorsese, director of<br />\nTaxi Driver and Raging Bull to<br />\nproduce a film of more<br />\nsubstance, the film should not<br />\nbe seen as a failure: After<br />\nHours succeeds on its own<br />\nterms, even though these terms<br />\nmay not be among Scorsese's<br />\nmore ambitious ones.<br />\nThe story is about one evening in the life of Paul Hackett<br />\n(Griffin Dunne), a word processor somewhat unsatisfied<br />\nwith his lot in life. While this<br />\nparticular evening may be extraordinary for the hero, it is<br />\ndoubtful that this string of<br />\ndisasters is the change of pace<br />\nHackett had in mind.<br />\nAfter work, in a New York<br />\ncoffee shop, Dunne meets Roseanna Arquette (best. known<br />\nfor her role in Desperately<br />\n<br />\nSeeking Susan), and he even<br />\nmanages to get her number.<br />\nUnfortunately, he thinks, his<br />\npen won't write at the most<br />\nvital of times. But Dunne just<br />\ncannot leave well enough alone<br />\nand accept this omen for what<br />\nit is. He calls Arquette that<br />\nevening and arranges a date for<br />\nstill later that night.<br />\nAll Dunne has in his wallet is<br />\na $20 bill (a la Easy Bank),<br />\nwhich flies out the window during his cab ride to SoHo, leaving Dunne nearly penniless in a<br />\nneighborhood far from his<br />\nown. And the more Dunne<br />\nfinds out about Arquette, the<br />\nweirder things seem to get: she's<br />\nseparated from a man whose<br />\nobsession with The Wizard of<br />\nOz spills over into bedroom activity, she seems to be undergoing treatment for some type of<br />\nsevere burns, and she can barely hold the same line of conversation for more than one<br />\nsentence at a time. Arquette's<br />\nroommate, a leather-clad<br />\nsculptress played by Linda<br />\nFiorentino, specializes in making plaster of Paris bagels with<br />\ncream cheese, and is currently<br />\nhard at work on her latest<br />\n<br />\nendeavor, a paper mache model<br />\nof a man screaming out in<br />\nagony. When things just get too<br />\nweird for Hackett, he runs out<br />\non Arquette, and proceeds to<br />\nrun into Terri Garr who plays<br />\na 60's-obsessed waitress, lava<br />\nlamp, bee-hive hairdo and all,<br />\nat the sleazy Terminal Bar, and<br />\ninto Cheech and Chong who<br />\nplay twO robbers who seem to<br />\nclean out every apartment in<br />\nSoHo before the night is<br />\nthrough.<br />\nBut run away as he might,<br />\nHackett simply cannot escape<br />\nthe SoHo streets (the 97' in his<br />\npocket just doesn't cover the<br />\nnewly-raised $1.50 subway fare,<br />\nthe fare having been raised as<br />\nof midnight that night), and as<br />\na result he finds himself:<br />\nresponsible for a suicide; on the<br />\nreceiving end of a mohawk<br />\nhaircut; accused of Cheech and<br />\nChong's robberies; pursued by<br />\na Mister Softee ice cream truck;<br />\ntrapped inside a piece of<br />\nmodern art; and the butt of<br />\nwhat seems to be hundreds of<br />\nother coincidences, all worse<br />\nthan the last.<br />\nAfter Hours maintains a high<br />\nlevel of comedy throughout this<br />\n<br />\nstring of coincidences; the ideas<br />\nbehind much of the action are<br />\nvery funny to begin with, and<br />\nthe talent of the cast serves to<br />\nmake these moments even funnier. Hackett is especially good,<br />\nas he manages to retain the<br />\nsympathy of the audience even<br />\nwhen his desire for a cheap one<br />\nnight stand, and the cruelty of<br />\nhis rejection of Arquette are<br />\nobvious to the viewer.<br />\nBut, unfortunately, After<br />\nHours never rises above being<br />\nsimply a string a bad luck and<br />\ncoincidences. The events<br />\ndepicted in After Hours seem to<br />\npile up one on top of the other<br />\nrather than heading in a particular direction that would give<br />\nthe film a true structure. As it<br />\nstands, After Hours is just a<br />\nbunch of events lacking<br />\nsomething, just one climaxing<br />\nevent, which can serve to tie it<br />\nall together. Perhaps the film's<br />\nfinal coincidence is the one<br />\nwhere the viewer is meant to see<br />\neverything fall together, since<br />\n<br />\nthe main character has come<br />\nfull circle, but there just isn't<br />\nenough build-up to this coincidence to indicate that it is the<br />\nculmination of the evening. As<br />\npresented by Scorsese, this final<br />\nevent is just one more ordinary<br />\nlink in the chain.<br />\nStill, the film's high comedy<br />\nand cleverly thought-out action<br />\nis enough to save this film from<br />\nits own plotlessness. And much<br />\nof the camera work and editing<br />\nused in the first half is also<br />\nhighly inventive and entertaining (a speeded-up cab ride, a<br />\ngracefully floating $20 bill, keys<br />\ndropped from a building falling<br />\ndirectly into the camera, and<br />\nothers), even if such work is<br />\nconspicuously absent in the<br />\nfilm's second half. It's best not<br />\nto ponder After Hours's flaws,<br />\nthough; if you turn off your<br />\nmind and just enjoy all the<br />\nlaughs of this definitely bizarre<br />\nmovie, After Hours will leave<br />\nyou satisfied.<br />\n<br />\nSenior Class Film Series<br />\n41.4440\"\"\"-<br />\n<br />\nMore Record Reviews<br />\nContinued from Page 12<br />\nstring of impressive credits, including R.E.M.'s Murmur.

Alfred A.<br />\nKnopf, Inc.<br />\n$15.95. 278 pages.<br />\nRay Bradbury has been tagged as \"The World's Greatest<br />\nLiving Science Fiction Writer.\"<br />\nThe title does not begin to<br />\ndescribe his breadth. His new<br />\ndetective novel, Death is a<br />\nLonely Business, is a full length<br />\nthriller-mystery-supernaturaldetective story, and that's quite<br />\na mouthful, which Bradbury<br />\npulls off with his characteristic<br />\nflair. This novel is his first since<br />\nSomething Wicked This Way<br />\nComes was published in 1962.<br />\n(I own a first printing in case<br />\n<br />\nyou're interested in offering a<br />\nmillion dollars for it) but still<br />\nexhibits his trademarks. At the<br />\nfore is his descriptive imagery,<br />\nhis developed characters, an involving plot and of course<br />\npages chock full of lovable<br />\neccentrics.<br />\nThe novel is set in Venice,<br />\nCalifornia, in 1949, as the<br />\nwaterfront amusement park is<br />\nbeing torn down. The hero is a<br />\nstruggling young writer who<br />\nsells his stories every now and<br />\nthen to pulp magazines, much<br />\nlike Bradbury himself did a few<br />\nages ago. One foggy haunted<br />\nnight the writer discovers a<br />\nbody in the canal, beckoning to<br />\nhim from inside an abandoned<br />\nlion cage. It is only the beginning, as more deaths tumble out<br />\n<br />\nfrom the run down houses of<br />\nVenice. From Fanny Florianna<br />\nthe 380 pound diva, to the<br />\nthousand year old lady across<br />\ntown, who sold canaries a<br />\ngeneration ago.<br />\nThe writer turned detective<br />\nmeets up with Elmo Crumley,<br />\na police detective who unfolds<br />\ninto a many faceted man and<br />\ntogether they begin to investigate the deaths, or are they<br />\nmurders? They seem accidental, but then why is someone<br />\nhaunting the two, with<br />\nseaweed? Why is Henry the<br />\nblind man standing watch?<br />\nWhy is the ugly man with the<br />\ngod's body naked in the waves?<br />\nThe plot is fast-paced and<br />\nstimulating, full of ideas and<br />\nhints and clues. One gets literally wrapped up in the story,<br />\noblivious to time, delighting in<br />\nthe ambience and mystique of<br />\nVenice in a time none of us<br />\nhave experienced. Bradbury<br />\ncreates a time and a place,<br />\npopulates it with the strangest<br />\npeople, and begins to scatter the<br />\nclues to the wind.<br />\nBradbury is the master<br />\nstoryteller and he proves it once<br />\nmore. The imagery he conjures<br />\ninto one's mind is so clear and<br />\ndefined that reading is next to<br />\nbeing there. There is not a<br />\nthought nor a scene that does<br />\nnot build towards the climax,<br />\nthe unveiling of the murderer.<br />\nAs the writer speaks in the first<br />\nperson, we are there, on the<br />\npier as the dense fog drifts<br />\nthrough Venice, or answering<br />\nthe phone on the corner in a<br />\npouring rain. Bradbury pulls all<br />\nthe right strings, without<br />\nleading the reader by the nose,<br />\nbut by involving the reader, absorbing him or her into the<br />\nstory.<br />\nRay Bradbury is not limited<br />\nas a science fiction writer, he<br />\nhas been criticised as being untrue to science, but is science<br />\nthe thing? Of course not, it's<br />\nthe story, the background is only a framework, a device to<br />\nconvey the author's ideas.<br />\n<br />\nBradbury has always used this<br />\nto his advantage. His stories are<br />\nfull of places and backgrounds,<br />\nthey are the mood creators, the<br />\nstage setters but ultimately it is<br />\nthe plot that makes Bradbury<br />\nso distinctive. He combines<br />\ngenres so well, incorporating<br />\nmysticism and the supernatural<br />\nwith history from the past and<br />\nthe future.<br />\nIn Death is a Lonely<br />\nBusiness, Bradbury spins a tale<br />\nof detectives, as Daishell Hammett would, in one of is<br />\nfavorite medums, the murky<br />\npast. The title is the key and<br />\none finds it so appropriate at<br />\nthe end of the novel. And the<br />\nkey word...Death. It permeates<br />\nthe book, the death of (the)<br />\npeople coinciding with the torturous death of the pier. The<br />\nscreaming rollercoaster grinds<br />\nto a halt and falls with twisting<br />\nmetal. Its twists and bumps and<br />\nturns. Its smoothness and then<br />\nits terrifying drops. When the<br />\ngreat rollercoaster dies, life<br />\ndoes not. Life always goes on.<br />\nThe hero, the writer finds hope<br />\nand determination, the will to<br />\ngo on to catch up to the<br />\nmurderer and stop him, or is it<br />\na her.<br />\nThe cast of characters is<br />\ntraditional Bradury, incarnations of good and evil. Bradbury grew up in Waukegan, Illinois and one of his favorites<br />\nas a child were the wandering<br />\ncircuses and gypsy shows. In<br />\nmany of his stories these people appear, and this one is no<br />\ndifferent. The characters are<br />\nmostly freaks, such as Fanny,<br />\nonce a well known soprano, but<br />\nnow reduced to living in a<br />\nchair, eating and singing. Our<br />\nnarrator, the writer, is an innocent young man with a baby<br />\nface. His name is never revealed and one might suggest that<br />\nBradbury has put himself ito<br />\nthe novel, his own hero. What<br />\nfurther sorcery but to live with<br />\none's own dream characters?<br />\nTo meet one's childhood idols<br />\nand to live in a different land,<br />\n<br />\nthe reader is subtly aware of the<br />\nfact that Venice, California is<br />\nslowly enveloping him. Bradbury's use of the first person<br />\ncompletes the effect. The<br />\ncharacters run the gamut, from<br />\nparanoid to overbearing, quiet<br />\nand shy to aggressive and confident. A spectrum of people to<br />\nlove and to hate is represented.<br />\nBradbury has brought<br />\ntogether so many elements that<br />\nit seems somewhat overwhelming. At points it may seem too<br />\ndetailed, for every crack in the<br />\ncement is there, every piercing<br />\ncry of the banshee. If one reads<br />\nwhile half asleep much of the<br />\ndetail glosses along and is<br />\nquickly forgotten. So much is<br />\npacked into 278 pages of novel<br />\nthat a few hours is not enough<br />\ntime to absorb it all. Bradbury's<br />\nuse of metaphors and similes is<br />\nexquisite and expert, but can be<br />\nconfusing. There lies my single<br />\ncomplaint, the choking feeling<br />\nof being crushed by images.<br />\nDeath is a Lonely Business is<br />\na novel written on several levels<br />\nand thus can be read on several<br />\nlevels. It's deeper than it may<br />\nseem, but taken straightforwardly it is still a fun detective<br />\nstory, suitable for children. It's<br />\nalso a look at people, scared<br />\npeople and willful people, people that become so real one<br />\nfeels that one knows them. The<br />\nnovel is also a love story, a<br />\nstory of love between people, of<br />\nlove for people and love for<br />\nideas and dreams and the truth.<br />\nIt is sure to delight all, from<br />\nthe staunch worldwide Bradbury fans to the new reader.<br />\nThe old fan will recognize<br />\nBradbury's talent and style in<br />\nthe novel while new readers will<br />\ndiscover a gripping story with<br />\na different light. Death is a<br />\nLonely Business is a fun book<br />\nto read, it encompasses all the<br />\nemotions and is presented in a<br />\nfashion that one can sink fangs<br />\ninto. Bradbury never, and I<br />\nmean never, ceases to entertain.<br />\n<br />\nHagar: He's So Horrible, Yet So Wonderful!<br />\nby Amitava 7 Biswas A.O.<br />\nHagar the Horrible's Very<br />\nNearly Complete Viking<br />\nHandbook<br />\nby Dik Browne, Workman<br />\nPublishing, Inc., $15.95. 96<br />\npages.<br />\nEveryone's favorite Viking<br />\nis back to share his knowledge<br />\nand wisdom.

People with<br />\nAIDS Related Complex(ARC)<br />\nexperience some AIDS-related<br />\nsymptoms, including fatigue<br />\nand weight loss, yet here the<br />\nHTLV-3 infection is of a nonfatal form. With AIDS patients, the virus is fatal. Some<br />\nARC patients, but not all, later<br />\ngo on to develop AIDS.<br />\nSymptoms of AIDS are<br />\nessentially those of a chronic<br />\nflu. The patient feels continually weak and feverish, has night<br />\nsweats and swollen lymph<br />\nnodes, and is likely to suffer<br />\nfrom diarrhea. As of yet, there<br />\nis no cure for AIDS and treatment is at the level of secondary<br />\ninfections. A year after<br />\ndiagnosis, the patient is very<br />\ndebilitated and his chances of<br />\nsurvival are slim. After two<br />\nyears, 80 per cent of the patients will have died, and five<br />\nyears after diagnosis, close to<br />\n100 per cent have died.<br />\nEssentially, there are four<br />\nhigh-risk groups: homosexual<br />\nmen comprising the vast majority of the AIDS cases, I.V.<br />\ndrug abusers, blood transfusion<br />\nrecipients of the last five years<br />\nincluding many hemophiliacs,<br />\nand heterosexuals whose partners are of high risk groups. A<br />\nmember of a high risk group<br />\nshould have his blood tested for<br />\nexposure to the AIDS virus.<br />\n<br />\nBlood can be tested at blood<br />\ndonation centers or at a city<br />\nhealth department.<br />\nEpidemiological evidence indicates that AIDS can be<br />\ntransmitted by sexual intercourse via semen, and via the<br />\nblood as in blood transfusions,<br />\nthe sharing of unsterile needles<br />\namong I.V. drug users, and the<br />\nmixing of maternal and fetal<br />\nblood during pregnancy and<br />\ndelivery. (The highly accurate<br />\nand sensitive ELISA screening<br />\ntest for HTLV-3 virus in blood<br />\nhas returned the nation's blood<br />\nsupply to very safe levels.) Sexually speaking, if one partner is<br />\ninfected, male to male intercourse, particularly anal intercourse, is a very high risk factor. Intercourse between an infected male and a healthy<br />\nfemale is less likely to transmit<br />\nthe disease, but nevertheless effective. Transmission is not<br />\nvery likely at all during intercourse between an infected<br />\nfemale and a healthy male. As<br />\nof yet, there is no data available<br />\non contraction of the disease<br />\nthrough oral-genital stimulation. The virus is harbored in<br />\nwhite blood cells, which are<br />\nplentiful in the blood, semen,<br />\nmilk and other bodily fluids including saliva and tears. Indeed, the virus has been<br />\ndiscovered in all these fluids.<br />\nThere is some question as to<br />\nwhether a mother may transmit<br />\nthe virus to an infant through<br />\nher milk, yet there is \"absolutely no epidemiological evidence<br />\n<br />\nto implicate saliva or tears in<br />\ntransmission of the disease.\"<br />\nNor is there any evidence that<br />\ncasual contact (shaking hands,<br />\nhugging, kissing) with an AIDS<br />\npatient, or using public<br />\nfacilities, will endanger one to<br />\nAIDS. Lack of knowledge and<br />\nfear of a disease known to be<br />\nfatal leads the general public to<br />\ntake unnecessary precautions<br />\nand to discriminate unfairly<br />\nagainst AIDS victims and<br />\nhomosexuals.<br />\nPreventing AIDS does not<br />\nrequire major changes in one's<br />\nlifestyle, but there are certain<br />\nprecautions doctors recommend to minimize chances of<br />\ncontracting it. First, sexual relations should be limited to one<br />\nperson well known to you.<br />\nSecondly, homosexual males<br />\nare advised to avoid exchanges<br />\nof body fluids and to avoid<br />\nviolent sex.

Something is different<br />\nabout the single service lane on<br />\nCharles Street, other than its<br />\ndirection of traffic. The southbound lane, which extends<br />\nfrom University Parkway to<br />\n29th Street, sparkles because<br />\nit's made of glasphalt.<br />\nAccording to James L. Kapplin of the Department of<br />\nPublic Works, glasphalt was<br />\nborn out of the environmental<br />\nmovement of the late 1960's. It<br />\nwas one of many attempts to<br />\nrecycle waste products, such as<br />\ntin cans, newspapers, and, in<br />\nthis case, glass. Regular streets<br />\nare paved with a mixture of<br />\nasphalt (which is derived from<br />\npetroleum), sand, and other<br />\ncomponents. Stone is added as<br />\nan \"aggregate,\" which is essential for binding the mixture<br />\ntogether. In glasphalt, crushed<br />\nglass replaces 30 to 40 percent<br />\nof this aggregate.<br />\nThe first street in Baltimore<br />\nresurfaced with glasphalt was<br />\nthe length of Charles between<br />\nLexington and Saratoga Streets,<br />\ndowntown. this stretch was<br />\npaved in 1971, at the suggestion<br />\nof Mayor Schaefer. Since then,<br />\nseventeen street sections have<br />\n<br />\nbeen repaved with glasphalt in<br />\nBaltimore. The lane in front of<br />\nthe MSE was done in September of 1984. Other cities, including New York, have also<br />\nused glasphalt in the past fifteen years.<br />\nGlasphalt is used only on<br />\nmain and secondary roads. It is<br />\nnot used on residential streets,<br />\nfor safety reasons. On busy<br />\nstreets, such as Charles, the<br />\nglass chips on the surface are<br />\nworn down within hours by the<br />\nheavy traffic flow. On quiet<br />\nresidential streets, however, it<br />\nwas feared that children playing in the street may be cut by<br />\nloose pieces of glass, before car<br />\ntires could smooth down the<br />\nsurface.<br />\nAlthough glasphalt was first<br />\nused for conservation, it is continued now purely for<br />\naesthetics. While citizens<br />\nbrought an excess of glass bottles to landfills for recycling in<br />\nthe early 1970's, now there is a<br />\nshortage. In order to use the<br />\nglass in the asphalt, it must first<br />\nbe \"cleaned.\" This procedure<br />\ninvolves removing, by hand, all<br />\n-the pieces of metal and paper<br />\nlabels from the bottles. Furthermore, only the opaque glass is<br />\nused in glasphalt; clear glass is<br />\nrecycled by the bottling com-<br />\n<br />\npanies. Thus, although glasphalt was originally intended to<br />\nsave money on the stone aggregate, which must be mined,<br />\nit ends up costing ten to fifteen<br />\ndollars more per ton. One ton<br />\nof asphalt translates into 18<br />\nsquare yards of pavement, one<br />\ninch thick. Therefore, since<br />\nseveral tons are needed to cover<br />\na two-to-three block area,<br />\nglasphalt is certainly not the<br />\nmost economical way of paving<br />\na street. An exception to this<br />\n<br />\nrule exists in the southern<br />\nUnited States, where stone is in<br />\nshort supply. Since stone must<br />\nbe shipped to the south from<br />\nthe northeast, the cost of<br />\nregular asphalt may be equal<br />\nto, or even more than, the cost<br />\nof glasphalt.<br />\nSo, why use glasphalt in<br />\nBaltimore? In short, because it<br />\nlooks nice. It is much more<br />\ncheerful to drive at night down<br />\na bright, sparkling street than<br />\na dull, gray asphalt one. Other<br />\n<br />\nthan the cost, there are no<br />\ndisadvantages to glasphalt. It<br />\nwears just well as regular<br />\nasphalt, it doesn't get any more<br />\nslippery in snow or rain, and is<br />\nno more prone to potholes. According to Kapplin, one or two<br />\nstreets will be done each year in<br />\nBaltimore, as the supply of<br />\nglass permits. Perhaps in ten<br />\nyears, when we come back to<br />\nvisit Hopkins, we may find that<br />\nall the streets leading here are<br />\nsparkling.<br />\n<br />\nTom Barthel<br />\n<br />\nThe Charles Street service lane, which sparkles from University Parkway to 29th Street.<br />\n<br />\n\fNEWS-LETTER/17<br />\n<br />\nResearch in AIDS<br />\nContinued from Page 16<br />\nthe immune system what to do,<br />\nhow well to do it, and when to<br />\nturn it off.\" They are the<br />\n\"primary coordinators\" of the<br />\nimmune system, and the<br />\nHTLV-3 virus \"homes in on<br />\nthese cells.\" HTLV-3 is an<br />\nRNA-virus; all its coding information is stored in RNA rather<br />\nthan DNA.

He inherits<br />\na men's team that finished sixth<br />\nin the nation last year, while<br />\ncapturing their 15th straight<br />\nMAC title, and a women's<br />\nteam that routinely places first<br />\nor second in the conference.<br />\nThe Jays may find it a little<br />\ntough to win at VCU, however,<br />\nbut not because they are a particularly tough opponent. The<br />\nproblem is that there is a water<br />\npolo tournament up at RPI,<br />\nand several top Hopkins swimmers play for the polemen. Fortunately for Kennedy's troops,<br />\nthis is the last time the two will<br />\nconflict.<br />\nLast Saturday, the squad<br />\nparticipated in the MAC relays<br />\nat Gettysburg University. For<br />\nKennedy, it was a homecoming<br />\nof sorts, as he coached the<br />\nBullets for five years before<br />\ncoming to Homewood.<br />\nThe meet itself was quite informal. Times were kept for the<br />\nracers, but point totals for each<br />\ntime were not tabulated. It did,<br />\nhowever, give all the coaches a<br />\ngood chance to see their swimmers perform in competition,<br />\nand Kennedy liked what he<br />\nsaw. The coach singled out Dan<br />\nFritch, Mark Postler, Mike<br />\nMcGinnis, Ian Brooks, and<br />\nChris Anderson on the men's<br />\nsi<br />\n)nd Michelle Scott, Janice<br />\n\" o, Katy Jenkins and<br />\nKaren Stefanko for the women<br />\n<br />\ntheir<br />\noutstanding<br />\nfor<br />\nperformances.<br />\nAs for his goals in '85, Kennedy would like to see the<br />\nwomett recapture the MAC<br />\ncrown. They fell to Gettysburg<br />\nlast year, but the coach is confident that they can return to<br />\nthe top. For the men, winning<br />\nthe conference just isn't<br />\nenough. Richard Nixon was in<br />\nhis first term as president the<br />\nlast time they failed to do this.<br />\nInstead, Kennedy is shooting<br />\nfor an improvement in the national rankings. It's unlikely<br />\nthat Hopkins can take a team<br />\ntitle this year, but a move back<br />\nup to the top three or four isn't<br />\nimpossible.<br />\n<br />\n************<br />\n<br />\nHarriers<br />\nContinued from Page 18<br />\ning at this point of the season.<br />\nThis is important as the Jays attend the most prestigious meets<br />\nof the season in the final weeks.<br />\nThis year's exceptional talent<br />\ncoupled with noteworthy<br />\ncoaching should place the Jays<br />\nin the top three slots at the<br />\nMAC's.<br />\nIn other cross country news,<br />\nthe male Harriers will attend<br />\nthe MAC meet this week in Belmont(No, not the horse racing<br />\ntrack).

The<br />\ncar rental plan will be taken up<br />\nwith Student Council since it is<br />\nnot a project which the<br />\nfreshman class would be able to<br />\ncarry out. The hotline proposal<br />\n\"has not yet been discussed,\"<br />\nsaid Howard.<br />\nEach of the six committees<br />\nset up at the meeting has a<br />\nchairman and an \"executive advisor.\" Anil Murty, the executive advisor of the FundRaising Committee, explained<br />\nthat the purpose of the advisor<br />\nsystem was \"to get a lot of<br />\nstudents involved in the committees and coordinate , them<br />\nwith each other.\" The advisors<br />\nare to act as \"overseers\" of the<br />\ncommittees.<br />\nAnimesh Agarwal, chairman<br /><br />\nCorrection<br />\nIn last week's headline and<br />\nphoto caption relating to the<br />\nNews-Letter's article on the<br />\nPhi Psi 500, the earnings of<br />\nthe event were incorrectly<br />\nreported to be $12,000.<br />\nThe correct value was that<br />\nreported in the article, namely $1,200.<br /><br />\nof the Publicity Committee said<br />\nthat his committee \"basically<br />\nneeds members. We have ten to<br />\ntwelve signed up, which would<br />\nbe good, but I don't know how<br />\nmany will be active,\" he said.<br />\nThe first job of the committee<br />\nwill be to publicize the dance on<br />\nthe fifteenth. The executive advisor of the committee is Ranjit Bagga.<br />\nJohn Faulkingham, chairman of the Social Committee,<br />\nsaid that the only \"formally<br />\nplanned\" social event so far is<br />\nthe dance on the fifteenth. His<br />\ncommittee has chosen \"Clever<br />\nLines\" as the band for the<br />\ndance. Faulkingham has heard<br />\nthe group's demo tape and<br />\ndescribed them as \"very, very<br />\ngood.\" He added that the committee is \"still looking for ideas<br />\nfor trips, parties, movies,\" and<br />\nother events, and that suggestions by members of the class<br />\nare welcome. The executive advisor of the committee is Cary<br />\nGross.<br />\nThe chairman of the FundRaising Committee is Brook<br />\nWeirs, and its advisor is Anil<br />\nMurty. The committee held its<br />\nsecond meeting on November<br />\n6, and is still \"brainstorming<br />\nfor ideas on fund-raising,\" according to Weirs. He stated<br />\nthat their goal is to have the<br />\nclass sponsor \"events that will<br />\nmake money and also serve the<br />\nfreshman class.\" The only concrete suggestion so far is for a<br />\nsale, possibly of painter's caps.<br />\nJohnathan Fubbard is \"cohelper\" to the committee.<br />\nThe Education Committee,<br />\nchaired by Kris Ann Cappelutti and advised by Erick Santos,<br />\nwill be in charge of several of<br />\nBruce Howard's proposed projects, including the test file, the<br />\nsoapbox, and discussion group<br />\norganization. The topics of the<br />\ndiscussions are on how to<br />\nstudy.<br /><br />\nThe committee has considered cooperating with the<br />\ndorm council to sponsor study<br />\nsessions before finals, holding<br />\nsome type of program during<br />\nintersession, trying to increase<br />\nfreshman alcohol awareness,<br />\nand sponsoring a new pre-frosh<br />\ntype program in which the<br />\nsenior classes of area high<br />\nschools would visit to find out<br />\nwhat college is like.<br />\nA \"career week\" for<br />\nfreshmen with different days<br />\nfor different disciplines and<br />\nspeakers from outside the<br />\nUniversity is planned for the second semester. Cappelutti said<br />\nthat the committee's primary<br />\nproblem was that \"we need<br />\npeople. We only have six<br />\nmembers.\"<br />\nThe communications committee is chaired by Sagar<br />\nLonial and its advisor is Grace<br />\nKung. Lonial said that the main<br />\npurpose of the committee is<br />\n\"making freshmen aware of<br />\nwhat's going on in Baltimore.<br />\nThere are a lot of things going<br />\non out there that are a lot of<br />\nfun, and people should know<br />\nabout them,\" he said.

At present, the<br />\nCenter is involved in the<br />\nHopkins Ultraviolet Telescope<br />\n(HUT) to be launched by the<br />\nspace shuttle in March, as well<br />\nas the Hubble Space Telescope,<br />\nwhich is scheduled for launch in<br />\n1986.<br />\nCommenting on the new<br />\nCenter, University president<br />\nSteven Muller said, \"Johns<br />\nHopkins is now widely<br />\nrecognized as a leader in<br />\nastronomy and astrophysics.<br />\nThe University is committed to<br />\nadvancing knowledge in this<br />\nfield, and the Center for<br />\nAstrophysical<br />\nSciences<br />\nrepresents an exciting new stage<br />\nin that committment. Arthur<br />\nDavidsen is a first-rate scientist<br />\nand administrator and has<br />\nalready begun to assemble a<br />\nsuperb scientific team.\"<br />\nThe HUT project is the<br />\nlargest assignment that is being<br />\nundertaken by the new Center.<br />\nThis joint Hopkins-NASA project is headed by Davidsen, the<br />\nprincipal investigator. The<br />\nHopkins Ultraviolet Telescope<br />\nwill examine sources of<br />\nultraviolet light in various<br />\nregions of space.<br />\nAccording to Davidsen,<br />\n\"HUT is unique because it can<br />\nextremely<br />\nshort<br />\ndetect<br />\nultraviolet wavelengths and<br />\ntherefore allows us to see the<br />\nwhole spectrum.\" HUT was<br />\nconceived, designed, and built<br />\nby Hopkins scientists and<br />\nengineers at Homewood and<br />\nPhysics<br />\nApplied<br />\nthe<br />\nLaboratory.<br />\nResearch at the new Center<br />\nalso includes the study of observations made with the Hubble<br />\nSpace Telescope. This telescope<br />\nwill be operated by the Space<br />\nTelescope Science Institute, an<br />\nindependent organization<br />\nlocated at Homewood, made<br />\nup of members from 17 different universities. However,<br />\naccording to Davidsen,<br />\nHopkins and the new Center,<br />\nwill have preferential access to<br />\nthe observations made with the<br />\nFaint Object Spectrograph Instrument (part of the Hubble<br />\nTelescope) which was designed<br />\nat the Center.<br />\nOnce the Hubble Telescope is<br />\nin place it will allow scientists<br />\nto see up to 7 times farther in<br />\none direction and will increase<br />\nour three dimensional view of<br />\nthe universe 350 times.<br />\nAlong with space astronomy,<br />\nthe Center will also be involved<br />\nwith the study of theoretical<br />\nastrophysics, especially examinations of the formation of<br />\nstart and the energy produced<br />\nby quasars. The third major<br />\narea of study will be groundbased astronomy, the examination of data from surface<br />\ntelescopes.<br />\nDavidsen commented saying,<br />\n\"The combination of research<br />\nin space astronomy, in groundbased astronomy, and in<br /><br />\ntheoretical astrophysics should<br />\nmake the Johns Hopkins<br />\nHomewood Campus one of the<br />\nmost stimulating places in the<br />\nworld.\"<br />\nAccording to Davidsen, there<br />\nare several opportunities for<br />\nundergraduates to participate in<br />\nthe Center.

That figure is<br />\nbased on someone staying here for Intersession, which doesn't cost any extra<br />\nunder the meal plan. Since most of the<br />\npeople on the meal plan are freshmen,<br />\nhowever, few stay here during January.<br />\nAnd if you don't count Intersession, a<br />\nstudent on the 14-meal plan would have<br />\nto eat\u2014get this-106.8 percent of his<br />\nmeals to save any money. How one is<br />\nsupposed to eat more meals than one has<br />\npaid for remains to be explained,<br />\nIn fairness, we probably ought to mention that the figures are a little more rational for the 19-meal-a-week plan. If<br />\nyou stay for Intersession on that plan,<br />\nfor example, you only have to eat 81.1<br />\npercent of your meals to save money\u2014<br />\nnot too difficult. If you don't stay for<br />\nIntersession, the figure goes up to 88<br />\npercent\u2014a little less likely but not<br />\nimpossible.<br /><br />\nIf freshmen were allowed to simply<br />\nforego the meal plan, none of this would<br />\nbe so bad. But in fact all freshmen (and<br />\neverybody else living in the dorms, for<br />\nthat matter) are required to buy one of<br />\nthe plans, whether they want it or not.<br />\nConsidering that the university is responsible for that restriction, it is surely also<br />\na responsibility of the administration to<br />\ninsure a rational plan is offered.<br />\nThis is all quite important just now<br />\nbecause the current contract with ARA<br />\nexpires this year. A food committee has<br />\nbeen formed to examine bids from<br />\nvarious companies. So even though<br />\nstudents will apparently have to suffer<br />\nthrough the spring semester with a<br />\nridiculous meal plan, perhaps the situation can be remedied for next year. In<br />\nparticular (and in ascending order of<br />\nauthority), Bettye Miller, director of auxilliary enterprises, Norman Krueger,<br />\nassociate dean for administrative services, and Robert Welch, dean of administration, should be careful to avoid<br />\nrepeating the mistakes of the past. (It<br />\nmight also be noted that it is Miller and<br />\nKrueger who are chiefly responsible for<br />\nthe current nonsense.)<br />\nThere can be no argument that this<br />\nyear's meal plan has labored under a<br />\nludicrous pricing scheme. There isn't<br />\nmuch that can be done about that now,<br />\nbut the administration ought to make<br />\nsure that a little common sense is<br />\nemployed in the future.<br /><br />\nSnap Judgements<br />\nThere is a tendency on the part of<br />\nstudents to be impatient. They are here,<br />\nafter all, only four years, and so they<br />\noften rush to rather quick judgements.<br />\nThat is certainly true of new administrators. When George Fisher was<br />\nappointed Dean of the School of Arts<br />\nand Sciences three years ago, students interested in such things were already calling him a failure or a success(depending<br />\non their views) by the end of the first<br />\nsemester. That's certainly understandable, but it's equally regrettable. It really takes at least two years in any new job<br />\nto get to know your way around the<br />\nplace.(That isn't to say that nothing can<br />\nbe accomplished in the first few months<br />\nof a new dean's tenure; merely that a<br />\nthorough analysis of how good a dean,<br />\nor provost, or president, so-and-so has<br />\nbeen can only be reached after an examination of his performance over<br />\nseveral years.)<br />\nUnfortunately, people seem to be<br />\nmaking the same snap judgements now<br />\nwith the newest dean\u2014Robert Welch,<br />\nthe dean of administration. Already,<br />\nsome folks are arguing about how good<br />\na job he has done. That fact is, though,<br />\nthat no one has any idea how well Welch<br />\nwill do his job (or, for that matter, how<br />\nwell the new structure of which he is the<br />\nmajor component will function). But<br />\nwhile it's too soon to form an opinion<br />\non Welch, people ought to keep an eye<br /><br />\non him, for rarely has a rookie been<br />\nthrown so many interesting issues. Those<br />\nissues were on display at a recent Student<br />\nCouncil meeting, when Welch talked<br />\nwith the council on a variety of things.<br />\nIn particular, student housing poses a<br />\nmajor problem for Welch. The university plans to renovate (and possibly expand) its current housing, and exactly<br />\nwhat those renovations ought to entail<br />\nremains an open question. The issue<br />\nclearly goes beyond technical questions<br />\nof when the renovations ought to be<br />\ndone and what the refurbished buildings<br />\nought to look like. The university has a<br />\nchance to change the nature of student<br />\nhousing at Hopkins. Should the new versions of Wolman and McCoy be closer<br />\nto traditional dormitories, for example?<br />\nOn an even more general level, should<br />\nuniversity-owned housing present a more<br />\ncollegiate atmosphere?

My friend<br />\nBasil and I, over the past summer, joined a band of idealistic<br />\nrevolutionaries. I must admit,<br />\nthough, that I was skeptical<br />\nwhen Basil first came to me<br />\nwith the idea. \"I thought we<br />\nwere going to Florida,\" I said,<br />\ntrying on a pair of sporty<br />\nsunglasses. \"New Jersey? Are<br />\nyou sure they're liberals?\"<br />\n\"Are you kidding?\" Basil<br />\nassured me. \"These guys<br />\nhaven't even seen 'Beverly Hills<br />\nCop'.\" I knew then that if it<br />\nwere an iconoclastic group I<br />\nwas looking for, I had come to<br />\nthe right place.<br />\nThese radicals were clever.<br /><br />\nNo one would ever have<br />\nthought to look for a revolutionary's headquarters in the<br />\nsuburbs. When we got there, we<br />\nwere greeted by Dmitri, our<br />\nleader. There were quick introductions, and I struck up a<br />\nconversation with Emily, a<br />\nnosy feminist from Bryn Mawr<br />\nwith long black hair and wire<br />\nrimmed glasses.\"Do you<br />\nbelieve in the E.R.A?\" she asked me.\"Sure,\" I said. She muttered something that sounded<br />\nlike \"Derivative, totally<br />\nderivative\" and walked away.<br />\nI was in love.<br />\nDmitri gathered us all around<br />\nthe projection T.V. and revealed the secret demands we would<br />\nprotest: demands which would<br />\nchange America forever. \"We<br />\nwant to abolish sales tax on the<br />\nnecessary foods: meats,<br /><br />\npoultry, fruits and all.\" I looked Dmitri in the eye and broke<br />\nthe news to him: \"There isn't<br />\nany tax on those items.\" When<br />\nhe heard this, Dmitri frowned<br />\npensively, then shot his arms up<br />\ninto the air. \"Hurrah!\" he<br />\nroared. That night was spent in<br />\na victory celebration.<br />\nDuring the course of the party I learned a few things. One,<br />\nDmitri's only leadership experience had been as vicepresident of the local Parker<br />\nStevenson fan club.

I suggested a protest<br />\nagainst higher education, but it<br />\nwas thought too conservative.<br />\nAs the days dragged on, Basil<br />\nand I began to have our doubts.<br />\nFinally, Basil spoke up. \"I<br />\nheard somewhere that Parker<br />\nStevenson voted Republican.\"<br />\nThere was a violent debate,<br />\nand, I must admit, some<br />\nshedding of tears, but the outcome was momentous.

The<br />\ngroup spent two nights doing<br />\nthis, and I suggested that in<br />\ncelebration of our victorious<br />\nprotest we get drunk, but it was<br />\nthought too conservative.

Peter Oehlkers<br />\nWhat is this \"spirit of rock<br />\n'n roll\" business? Is it really, as<br />\n98-Rock would have us believe,<br />\na bunch of long-haired guitar<br />\n\"heroes\" indulging themselves<br />\non a ten-foot stage in front of<br />\na huge mass of groveling<br />\nfanatics? Or is it, rather, a four<br />\npiece grinding out three-chord<br />\nthrash on a tiny two-foot stage<br />\nencompassed by a hot, sweaty,<br />\ncramped, hoppin' dance floor<br />\nin a hot, sweaty, cramped, hoppin' barroom down in the<br />\ndepths of the city, i.e. Richard<br />\nTaylor and the Ravers.<br />\n\"I consider Rock 'n Roll<br />\nmusic dance music. It's music<br />\nto dance to,\" says singerguitarist-song writer Richard<br />\nTaylor, and if that statement is<br />\na true indication of the rock 'n<br />\nroll spirit of the Ravers,<br />\ntonight's Senior Class Party in<br />\nthe Glass Pavilioa ought to be<br />\nthe place to be (you can save<br />\nBachelor Party til Saturday).<br />\nThe Ravers play what is<br />\nusually termed \"traditional<br />\nroots based\" rock 'n roll, according to Taylor. In other<br />\nwords, mid-60's rock with a<br />\ngood deal of scruffy slide blues,<br />\ncountry and western, and traditional pop thrown in for good<br />\nmeasure. They are not a cover<br />\nband, however, even though<br />\nthey play a lot of old Chuck<br />\nBerry, Buddy Holly, and Rolling Stones tunes. Taylor's<br />\noriginal songs make the band<br />\nwhat it is\u2014he quotes the<br />\nStones, Beatles and Bob Dylan<br />\n(of the mid-60's, not the later<br />\npsychedelic era) as his greatest<br />\ninfluences. Also, although they<br />\nplay songs by Gene Vincent and<br />\nother 50's rockers, Taylor is<br />\nquick to point out that they are<br />\nnot a \"rock-a-billy\" band\u2014a<br />\nlabel which tends to be quite<br />\nlimiting.<br />\nThe Ravers consist of<br />\nRichard Taylor on guitar, Neil<br />\nDissinger on bass, Matt<br />\nMaschal behind the drum kit,<br />\nand JHU's own senior English<br />\nmajor and guitarist, Bob Kannenberg. They will celebrate<br />\ntheir third year together next<br />\nFebruary. Taylor himself,<br />\nhowever, has a long history of<br />\nplaying in Baltimore. He was in<br />\nZen Archer, a very popular<br />\nBaltimore band of a few years<br />\nago, a band which Taylor says<br />\nwas louder, more Stoney, early Aerosmith-style rock and roll<br />\nwith as many hooks per pound<br />\nas possible.\" He emphasizes<br />\nthat then as now his band was<br />\nno place for guitar heroics, few<br />\nof the songs being longer than<br />\nthree minutes.<br />\nAfter Zen Archer broke up,<br />\nTaylor recorded a four song<br />\nsolo EP, on the basis of which<br />\nWeasel of WHFS has called<br />\nRichard Taylor and the Ravers<br />\nhis favorite band. The band<br />\nitself has put out a ten-song<br />\ncassette called Rave-On and a<br />\nsix-song EP titled This Side Up<br />\nis due to be released in three to<br />\nfour weeks. So far the critical<br /><br />\nDriven by energetic music<br />\ndirector Catherine Overhauser,<br />\nthe Hopkins Symphony Orchestra launched its fifth and<br />\nmost auspicious season yet last<br />\nSunday afternoon in Shriver<br />\nHall with a performance of fine<br />\nViennese works.<br />\nThough a bit awkwardly executed, the concert provided a<br />\nglimpse of this on the whole<br />\npromising group of musicians,<br />\nand offered a preview of the<br />\ncaliber of guest artists that the<br />\norchestra has managed to attract this season.<br />\nThe program began with the<br />\nOverture to Fidelio, Op. 72, by<br />\nLudwig van Beethoven. The<br />\nhistory of Fidelio, Beethoven's<br />\nonly opera, reveals that it took<br />\nthe composer four separate<br />\nwritings of the overture, all of<br />\nwhich were quite different, to<br />\ncreate the proper theatrical<br />\nquality in the piece which<br />\nwould please his friends and<br />\ncritics.<br />\nThe orchestra's french horn,<br />\nwhich is featured in the opening of the piece, but couldn't<br />\nquite accomplish the full, glowing tone finally intended by<br />\nBeethoven, and the violins<br /><br />\nseemed a bit tentative in their<br />\naccompaniment. Yet when the<br />\nwhole orchestra was given entrance, their confidence<br />\nmarkedly increased.<br />\nThe second piece performed<br />\nwas Haydn's Symphony No.<br />\n101 in D Major, subtitled \"The<br />\nClock\" for the bright \"ticking\"<br />\nfigure tossed about the orchestra in the second movement<br />\nwhich resembles the timekeeping of a venerable pendule. The<br />\nfirst movement opened with a<br />\n\"mysterious and misty\" section\u2014perhaps influenced by the<br />\nambience of London where<br />\nHaydn wrote the symphony\u2014<br />\nand this, too, proved challenging for the upper strings.<br />\nIn the second movement the<br />\n\"clock\" figure was initiated by<br />\nthe lower strings and the bassoon in a measured, slightly<br />\nhumorous fashion. The flute<br />\nthen took up the figure and<br />\ncontinued it with such clarity<br />\nand consistency that if one closed one's eyes, the conjured image of a fantastic and<br />\nmelodious timepiece was not<br />\neasily suppressed.<br />\nThe third movement with its<br />\npretentious style and subverting<br />\nContinued on Page 14<br /><br />\nWall of Voodoo<br />\nin Sammystown<br />\nby Sue Trowbridge<br />\nWall of Voodoo<br />\nSeven Days in Sammystown<br />\n(I.R.S.

Will be playing<br />\ntonight at the Glass Pavilion in what has to be the most highly publicized concert Hopkins has seen for quite some time. If crowds don't show<br />\ntonight you certainly can't use the poor publicity excuse.<br /><br />\npress Outside of Baltimore has<br />\nbeen quite appreciative of the<br />\nband's recorded output\u2014<br />\nBoston Rock, in particular,<br />\ngave his EP really good<br />\nnotices\u2014but in Baltimore so<br />\nfar he's been, in Taylor's<br />\nwords, \"raked over the coals.\"<br />\nHe has a few good words for<br />\nthe critical breed in general but<br />\nappreciates the fact that \"bad<br />\npress is the second best thing to<br />\ngood press\"\u2014it's better than<br />\nno press at all.<br />\nRichard Taylor and the<br />\nRavers is no complacent band.<br />\nAt the moment none of the<br />\nband members make rock 'n<br />\nroll their sole profession\u2014with<br />\nthe result, says Taylor, that<br />\n\"we get to play what we want<br />\nto play\"\u2014but they are definitely working towards the Big<br />\nTime. \"We eventually want to<br />\nown Beatrice,\" says Taylor. As<br />\nno one ever got a record contract playing around Baltimore,<br />\nthe band is relying on massive<br />\nshipments of demo tapes to get<br />\nmajor label interest. Recently,<br />\nSlash, the large independent<br />\nlabel in Los Angeles has expressed interest in them.<br /><br />\nBaltimore-born John Doe of<br />\nthe band X, which started on<br />\nSlash Records, has said that<br />\nBaltimore is a great place to be<br />\ninspired by but a lousy place to<br />\nhave any rock success. Richard<br />\nTaylor agrees: \"I'm inspired by<br />\ncities\u2014I get inspiration for<br />\nsongs from street people and<br />\nclub people\u2014just the way they<br />\nlook.\"<br />\nBut he accepts the fact that<br />\nBaltimore is not an original<br />\nband town. With the closings of<br />\nthe Marble Bar, Trenton Street<br />\nStop, and the Baltimore Pub<br />\nthere are barely any places in<br />\nBaltimcfre to play anymore.<br />\nThey've resorted to playing<br />\nBackstreets Cafe in Towson<br />\nand at numerous Phi Psi<br />\nparties\u2014which Taylor says are<br />\na \"blast every time.\" But even<br />\nGirards, once a bastion for<br />\nlocal talent, has been reduced to<br />\n\"assisting\" people tuck in their<br />\nshirt-tails. Responds Richard<br />\nTaylor:\"We don't worry about<br />\nour shirt-tails.\" That statement<br />\nalone ought to tell you in whose<br />\nheart the spirit of rock 'n roll<br />\nreally resides.<br /><br />\nIt's quite surprising to see<br />\nthat Wall of Voodoo is back.<br />\nAfter all, they lost their major<br />\nasset\u2014Stan Ridgway's deadpan<br />\nvoice, so perfectly droll on<br />\nVoodoo favorites like \"Back in<br />\n\"Mexican<br />\nand<br />\nFlesh\"<br />\nRadio\"\u2014when Ridgway left<br />\nthe band to pursue a solo<br />\ncareer.<br />\nSeven Days in Sammystown<br />\nisn't the bust it could have<br />\nbeen, considering that only two<br />\noriginal members remain.<br />\nDespite that, the new Voodoo<br />\ntry hard to recreate that one-ofa-kind sound perfected when<br />\nRidgway was at the helm\u2014<br />\nmusic for an urban cowboy's<br />\nHalloween hoedown. It's a fusion of rock 'n roll and the<br />\nsounds of the lone prairie,<br />\nplayed as if the performers had<br />\nbeen spent a little too long in<br />\nthe sun. Alternatively, picture<br />\nDevo if they had grown up in<br />\nArizona instead of Akron.<br />\nSammystown plays up the<br />\nmore marketable rock side of<br />\nVoodoo's music. New singer<br />\nAndy Prieboy does his best to<br />\nimitate Ridgway on \"Far Side<br />\nof Crazy\" and \"Big City,\" but<br />\nhe can't capture Stan's distinctive nasal tone. Still, he's not<br />\nbad; he just had a very hard act<br />\nto follow.<br />\nPrieboy doesn't have much<br />\nto work with, either, since the<br /><br />\nlyrics are strictly from banal<br />\ncity\u2014\"This business of love<br />\nwill never do, not for me and<br />\nnot for you/This business of<br />\nlove will never die, not for you<br />\nand not for 1,\" goes one<br />\nchorus.<br />\nWall of Voodoo have some<br />\ncatchy tracks here\u2014the eerie<br />\n\"Mona,\" the frenetic \"Room<br />\nwith a View.\" Still Sammystown isn't entirely satisfying, and some of it is downright<br />\nlackluster, like \"Blackboard<br />\nSky,\" a plodding rocker.<br />\nMaybe the spectre of Ridgway<br />\nneeds to be exorcised, so the<br />\nnew Voodoo can come into its<br />\nown.

While one might expect<br />\nMartin Scorsese, director of<br />\nTaxi Driver and Raging Bull to<br />\nproduce a film of more<br />\nsubstance, the film should not<br />\nbe seen as a failure: After<br />\nHours succeeds on its own<br />\nterms, even though these terms<br />\nmay not be among Scorsese's<br />\nmore ambitious ones.<br />\nThe story is about one evening in the life of Paul Hackett<br />\n(Griffin Dunne), a word processor somewhat unsatisfied<br />\nwith his lot in life. While this<br />\nparticular evening may be extraordinary for the hero, it is<br />\ndoubtful that this string of<br />\ndisasters is the change of pace<br />\nHackett had in mind.<br />\nAfter work, in a New York<br />\ncoffee shop, Dunne meets Roseanna Arquette (best. known<br />\nfor her role in Desperately<br /><br />\nSeeking Susan), and he even<br />\nmanages to get her number.<br />\nUnfortunately, he thinks, his<br />\npen won't write at the most<br />\nvital of times. But Dunne just<br />\ncannot leave well enough alone<br />\nand accept this omen for what<br />\nit is. He calls Arquette that<br />\nevening and arranges a date for<br />\nstill later that night.<br />\nAll Dunne has in his wallet is<br />\na $20 bill (a la Easy Bank),<br />\nwhich flies out the window during his cab ride to SoHo, leaving Dunne nearly penniless in a<br />\nneighborhood far from his<br />\nown. And the more Dunne<br />\nfinds out about Arquette, the<br />\nweirder things seem to get: she's<br />\nseparated from a man whose<br />\nobsession with The Wizard of<br />\nOz spills over into bedroom activity, she seems to be undergoing treatment for some type of<br />\nsevere burns, and she can barely hold the same line of conversation for more than one<br />\nsentence at a time. Arquette's<br />\nroommate, a leather-clad<br />\nsculptress played by Linda<br />\nFiorentino, specializes in making plaster of Paris bagels with<br />\ncream cheese, and is currently<br />\nhard at work on her latest<br /><br />\nendeavor, a paper mache model<br />\nof a man screaming out in<br />\nagony. When things just get too<br />\nweird for Hackett, he runs out<br />\non Arquette, and proceeds to<br />\nrun into Terri Garr who plays<br />\na 60's-obsessed waitress, lava<br />\nlamp, bee-hive hairdo and all,<br />\nat the sleazy Terminal Bar, and<br />\ninto Cheech and Chong who<br />\nplay twO robbers who seem to<br />\nclean out every apartment in<br />\nSoHo before the night is<br />\nthrough.<br />\nBut run away as he might,<br />\nHackett simply cannot escape<br />\nthe SoHo streets (the 97' in his<br />\npocket just doesn't cover the<br />\nnewly-raised $1.50 subway fare,<br />\nthe fare having been raised as<br />\nof midnight that night), and as<br />\na result he finds himself:<br />\nresponsible for a suicide; on the<br />\nreceiving end of a mohawk<br />\nhaircut; accused of Cheech and<br />\nChong's robberies; pursued by<br />\na Mister Softee ice cream truck;<br />\ntrapped inside a piece of<br />\nmodern art; and the butt of<br />\nwhat seems to be hundreds of<br />\nother coincidences, all worse<br />\nthan the last.<br />\nAfter Hours maintains a high<br />\nlevel of comedy throughout this<br /><br />\nstring of coincidences; the ideas<br />\nbehind much of the action are<br />\nvery funny to begin with, and<br />\nthe talent of the cast serves to<br />\nmake these moments even funnier. Hackett is especially good,<br />\nas he manages to retain the<br />\nsympathy of the audience even<br />\nwhen his desire for a cheap one<br />\nnight stand, and the cruelty of<br />\nhis rejection of Arquette are<br />\nobvious to the viewer.<br />\nBut, unfortunately, After<br />\nHours never rises above being<br />\nsimply a string a bad luck and<br />\ncoincidences. The events<br />\ndepicted in After Hours seem to<br />\npile up one on top of the other<br />\nrather than heading in a particular direction that would give<br />\nthe film a true structure. As it<br />\nstands, After Hours is just a<br />\nbunch of events lacking<br />\nsomething, just one climaxing<br />\nevent, which can serve to tie it<br />\nall together. Perhaps the film's<br />\nfinal coincidence is the one<br />\nwhere the viewer is meant to see<br />\neverything fall together, since<br /><br />\nthe main character has come<br />\nfull circle, but there just isn't<br />\nenough build-up to this coincidence to indicate that it is the<br />\nculmination of the evening. As<br />\npresented by Scorsese, this final<br />\nevent is just one more ordinary<br />\nlink in the chain.<br />\nStill, the film's high comedy<br />\nand cleverly thought-out action<br />\nis enough to save this film from<br />\nits own plotlessness. And much<br />\nof the camera work and editing<br />\nused in the first half is also<br />\nhighly inventive and entertaining (a speeded-up cab ride, a<br />\ngracefully floating $20 bill, keys<br />\ndropped from a building falling<br />\ndirectly into the camera, and<br />\nothers), even if such work is<br />\nconspicuously absent in the<br />\nfilm's second half. It's best not<br />\nto ponder After Hours's flaws,<br />\nthough; if you turn off your<br />\nmind and just enjoy all the<br />\nlaughs of this definitely bizarre<br />\nmovie, After Hours will leave<br />\nyou satisfied.<br /><br />\nSenior Class Film Series<br />\n41.4440\"\"\"-<br /><br />\nMore Record Reviews<br />\nContinued from Page 12<br />\nstring of impressive credits, including R.E.M.'s Murmur.

They only release<br />\none 12\" 45 every year or so\u2014<br />\nthat's probably all they can afford, considering their commitment to quality packaging and<br />\nproduction. But when they do<br />\nrelease a record, it's an occasion not to be missed.<br />\n\"Paradise\" is their third, and<br />\nfinest single. It further<br />\nstrengthens the argument that<br />\nthis band is going to be famous<br />\nsomeday. The danceable,<br />\nsynth-dominated sound that<br />\nthey embrace is certainly in<br />\nvogue these days; it's easy to<br />\nimagine \"Paradise\" on the<br />\nradio, fitting in with anything<br />\nfrom ABC to Power Station.<br />\nTeenage girls would love this<br />\nband; in fact,. some of the hipper ones already do.<br />\nThis may not sound like<br />\nmuch of a recommendation,<br />\nbut the truth is that Figures on<br />\na Beach are far too good to<br />\nleave to the teenybcp set. This<br />\nband should be heard, danced<br />\nto, and signed to a major label<br />\nso they can put out records<br />\nmore often! While \"In Camera<br />\nObscura\" is perfect for dance<br />\nclubs, \"Paradise\" is the more<br />\nrock-oriented midtempo side<br />\n(both songs, in fact, are here in<br />\n\"radio edits\" as well as extended versions).

Alfred A.<br />\nKnopf, Inc.<br />\n$15.95. 278 pages.<br />\nRay Bradbury has been tagged as \"The World's Greatest<br />\nLiving Science Fiction Writer.\"<br />\nThe title does not begin to<br />\ndescribe his breadth. His new<br />\ndetective novel, Death is a<br />\nLonely Business, is a full length<br />\nthriller-mystery-supernaturaldetective story, and that's quite<br />\na mouthful, which Bradbury<br />\npulls off with his characteristic<br />\nflair. This novel is his first since<br />\nSomething Wicked This Way<br />\nComes was published in 1962.<br />\n(I own a first printing in case<br /><br />\nyou're interested in offering a<br />\nmillion dollars for it) but still<br />\nexhibits his trademarks. At the<br />\nfore is his descriptive imagery,<br />\nhis developed characters, an involving plot and of course<br />\npages chock full of lovable<br />\neccentrics.<br />\nThe novel is set in Venice,<br />\nCalifornia, in 1949, as the<br />\nwaterfront amusement park is<br />\nbeing torn down. The hero is a<br />\nstruggling young writer who<br />\nsells his stories every now and<br />\nthen to pulp magazines, much<br />\nlike Bradbury himself did a few<br />\nages ago. One foggy haunted<br />\nnight the writer discovers a<br />\nbody in the canal, beckoning to<br />\nhim from inside an abandoned<br />\nlion cage. It is only the beginning, as more deaths tumble out<br /><br />\nfrom the run down houses of<br />\nVenice. From Fanny Florianna<br />\nthe 380 pound diva, to the<br />\nthousand year old lady across<br />\ntown, who sold canaries a<br />\ngeneration ago.<br />\nThe writer turned detective<br />\nmeets up with Elmo Crumley,<br />\na police detective who unfolds<br />\ninto a many faceted man and<br />\ntogether they begin to investigate the deaths, or are they<br />\nmurders? They seem accidental, but then why is someone<br />\nhaunting the two, with<br />\nseaweed? Why is Henry the<br />\nblind man standing watch?<br />\nWhy is the ugly man with the<br />\ngod's body naked in the waves?<br />\nThe plot is fast-paced and<br />\nstimulating, full of ideas and<br />\nhints and clues. One gets literally wrapped up in the story,<br />\noblivious to time, delighting in<br />\nthe ambience and mystique of<br />\nVenice in a time none of us<br />\nhave experienced. Bradbury<br />\ncreates a time and a place,<br />\npopulates it with the strangest<br />\npeople, and begins to scatter the<br />\nclues to the wind.<br />\nBradbury is the master<br />\nstoryteller and he proves it once<br />\nmore. The imagery he conjures<br />\ninto one's mind is so clear and<br />\ndefined that reading is next to<br />\nbeing there. There is not a<br />\nthought nor a scene that does<br />\nnot build towards the climax,<br />\nthe unveiling of the murderer.<br />\nAs the writer speaks in the first<br />\nperson, we are there, on the<br />\npier as the dense fog drifts<br />\nthrough Venice, or answering<br />\nthe phone on the corner in a<br />\npouring rain. Bradbury pulls all<br />\nthe right strings, without<br />\nleading the reader by the nose,<br />\nbut by involving the reader, absorbing him or her into the<br />\nstory.<br />\nRay Bradbury is not limited<br />\nas a science fiction writer, he<br />\nhas been criticised as being untrue to science, but is science<br />\nthe thing? Of course not, it's<br />\nthe story, the background is only a framework, a device to<br />\nconvey the author's ideas.<br /><br />\nBradbury has always used this<br />\nto his advantage. His stories are<br />\nfull of places and backgrounds,<br />\nthey are the mood creators, the<br />\nstage setters but ultimately it is<br />\nthe plot that makes Bradbury<br />\nso distinctive. He combines<br />\ngenres so well, incorporating<br />\nmysticism and the supernatural<br />\nwith history from the past and<br />\nthe future.<br />\nIn Death is a Lonely<br />\nBusiness, Bradbury spins a tale<br />\nof detectives, as Daishell Hammett would, in one of is<br />\nfavorite medums, the murky<br />\npast. The title is the key and<br />\none finds it so appropriate at<br />\nthe end of the novel. And the<br />\nkey word...Death. It permeates<br />\nthe book, the death of (the)<br />\npeople coinciding with the torturous death of the pier. The<br />\nscreaming rollercoaster grinds<br />\nto a halt and falls with twisting<br />\nmetal. Its twists and bumps and<br />\nturns. Its smoothness and then<br />\nits terrifying drops. When the<br />\ngreat rollercoaster dies, life<br />\ndoes not. Life always goes on.<br />\nThe hero, the writer finds hope<br />\nand determination, the will to<br />\ngo on to catch up to the<br />\nmurderer and stop him, or is it<br />\na her.<br />\nThe cast of characters is<br />\ntraditional Bradury, incarnations of good and evil. Bradbury grew up in Waukegan, Illinois and one of his favorites<br />\nas a child were the wandering<br />\ncircuses and gypsy shows. In<br />\nmany of his stories these people appear, and this one is no<br />\ndifferent. The characters are<br />\nmostly freaks, such as Fanny,<br />\nonce a well known soprano, but<br />\nnow reduced to living in a<br />\nchair, eating and singing. Our<br />\nnarrator, the writer, is an innocent young man with a baby<br />\nface. His name is never revealed and one might suggest that<br />\nBradbury has put himself ito<br />\nthe novel, his own hero. What<br />\nfurther sorcery but to live with<br />\none's own dream characters?<br />\nTo meet one's childhood idols<br />\nand to live in a different land,<br /><br />\nthe reader is subtly aware of the<br />\nfact that Venice, California is<br />\nslowly enveloping him. Bradbury's use of the first person<br />\ncompletes the effect. The<br />\ncharacters run the gamut, from<br />\nparanoid to overbearing, quiet<br />\nand shy to aggressive and confident. A spectrum of people to<br />\nlove and to hate is represented.<br />\nBradbury has brought<br />\ntogether so many elements that<br />\nit seems somewhat overwhelming. At points it may seem too<br />\ndetailed, for every crack in the<br />\ncement is there, every piercing<br />\ncry of the banshee. If one reads<br />\nwhile half asleep much of the<br />\ndetail glosses along and is<br />\nquickly forgotten. So much is<br />\npacked into 278 pages of novel<br />\nthat a few hours is not enough<br />\ntime to absorb it all. Bradbury's<br />\nuse of metaphors and similes is<br />\nexquisite and expert, but can be<br />\nconfusing. There lies my single<br />\ncomplaint, the choking feeling<br />\nof being crushed by images.<br />\nDeath is a Lonely Business is<br />\na novel written on several levels<br />\nand thus can be read on several<br />\nlevels. It's deeper than it may<br />\nseem, but taken straightforwardly it is still a fun detective<br />\nstory, suitable for children. It's<br />\nalso a look at people, scared<br />\npeople and willful people, people that become so real one<br />\nfeels that one knows them. The<br />\nnovel is also a love story, a<br />\nstory of love between people, of<br />\nlove for people and love for<br />\nideas and dreams and the truth.<br />\nIt is sure to delight all, from<br />\nthe staunch worldwide Bradbury fans to the new reader.<br />\nThe old fan will recognize<br />\nBradbury's talent and style in<br />\nthe novel while new readers will<br />\ndiscover a gripping story with<br />\na different light. Death is a<br />\nLonely Business is a fun book<br />\nto read, it encompasses all the<br />\nemotions and is presented in a<br />\nfashion that one can sink fangs<br />\ninto. Bradbury never, and I<br />\nmean never, ceases to entertain.<br /><br />\nHagar: He's So Horrible, Yet So Wonderful!<br />\nby Amitava 7 Biswas A.O.<br />\nHagar the Horrible's Very<br />\nNearly Complete Viking<br />\nHandbook<br />\nby Dik Browne, Workman<br />\nPublishing, Inc., $15.95. 96<br />\npages.<br />\nEveryone's favorite Viking<br />\nis back to share his knowledge<br />\nand wisdom.

It is<br />\nestimated that one million<br />\nAmericans have been exposed<br />\nto the virus, although most do<br />\nnot know it yet. People with<br />\nAIDS Related Complex(ARC)<br />\nexperience some AIDS-related<br />\nsymptoms, including fatigue<br />\nand weight loss, yet here the<br />\nHTLV-3 infection is of a nonfatal form. With AIDS patients, the virus is fatal. Some<br />\nARC patients, but not all, later<br />\ngo on to develop AIDS.<br />\nSymptoms of AIDS are<br />\nessentially those of a chronic<br />\nflu. The patient feels continually weak and feverish, has night<br />\nsweats and swollen lymph<br />\nnodes, and is likely to suffer<br />\nfrom diarrhea. As of yet, there<br />\nis no cure for AIDS and treatment is at the level of secondary<br />\ninfections. A year after<br />\ndiagnosis, the patient is very<br />\ndebilitated and his chances of<br />\nsurvival are slim. After two<br />\nyears, 80 per cent of the patients will have died, and five<br />\nyears after diagnosis, close to<br />\n100 per cent have died.<br />\nEssentially, there are four<br />\nhigh-risk groups: homosexual<br />\nmen comprising the vast majority of the AIDS cases, I.V.<br />\ndrug abusers, blood transfusion<br />\nrecipients of the last five years<br />\nincluding many hemophiliacs,<br />\nand heterosexuals whose partners are of high risk groups. A<br />\nmember of a high risk group<br />\nshould have his blood tested for<br />\nexposure to the AIDS virus.<br /><br />\nBlood can be tested at blood<br />\ndonation centers or at a city<br />\nhealth department.<br />\nEpidemiological evidence indicates that AIDS can be<br />\ntransmitted by sexual intercourse via semen, and via the<br />\nblood as in blood transfusions,<br />\nthe sharing of unsterile needles<br />\namong I.V. drug users, and the<br />\nmixing of maternal and fetal<br />\nblood during pregnancy and<br />\ndelivery. (The highly accurate<br />\nand sensitive ELISA screening<br />\ntest for HTLV-3 virus in blood<br />\nhas returned the nation's blood<br />\nsupply to very safe levels.) Sexually speaking, if one partner is<br />\ninfected, male to male intercourse, particularly anal intercourse, is a very high risk factor. Intercourse between an infected male and a healthy<br />\nfemale is less likely to transmit<br />\nthe disease, but nevertheless effective. Transmission is not<br />\nvery likely at all during intercourse between an infected<br />\nfemale and a healthy male. As<br />\nof yet, there is no data available<br />\non contraction of the disease<br />\nthrough oral-genital stimulation. The virus is harbored in<br />\nwhite blood cells, which are<br />\nplentiful in the blood, semen,<br />\nmilk and other bodily fluids including saliva and tears. Indeed, the virus has been<br />\ndiscovered in all these fluids.<br />\nThere is some question as to<br />\nwhether a mother may transmit<br />\nthe virus to an infant through<br />\nher milk, yet there is \"absolutely no epidemiological evidence<br /><br />\nto implicate saliva or tears in<br />\ntransmission of the disease.\"<br />\nNor is there any evidence that<br />\ncasual contact (shaking hands,<br />\nhugging, kissing) with an AIDS<br />\npatient, or using public<br />\nfacilities, will endanger one to<br />\nAIDS. Lack of knowledge and<br />\nfear of a disease known to be<br />\nfatal leads the general public to<br />\ntake unnecessary precautions<br />\nand to discriminate unfairly<br />\nagainst AIDS victims and<br />\nhomosexuals.<br />\nPreventing AIDS does not<br />\nrequire major changes in one's<br />\nlifestyle, but there are certain<br />\nprecautions doctors recommend to minimize chances of<br />\ncontracting it. First, sexual relations should be limited to one<br />\nperson well known to you.<br />\nSecondly, homosexual males<br />\nare advised to avoid exchanges<br />\nof body fluids and to avoid<br />\nviolent sex.

Something is different<br />\nabout the single service lane on<br />\nCharles Street, other than its<br />\ndirection of traffic. The southbound lane, which extends<br />\nfrom University Parkway to<br />\n29th Street, sparkles because<br />\nit's made of glasphalt.<br />\nAccording to James L. Kapplin of the Department of<br />\nPublic Works, glasphalt was<br />\nborn out of the environmental<br />\nmovement of the late 1960's. It<br />\nwas one of many attempts to<br />\nrecycle waste products, such as<br />\ntin cans, newspapers, and, in<br />\nthis case, glass. Regular streets<br />\nare paved with a mixture of<br />\nasphalt (which is derived from<br />\npetroleum), sand, and other<br />\ncomponents. Stone is added as<br />\nan \"aggregate,\" which is essential for binding the mixture<br />\ntogether. In glasphalt, crushed<br />\nglass replaces 30 to 40 percent<br />\nof this aggregate.<br />\nThe first street in Baltimore<br />\nresurfaced with glasphalt was<br />\nthe length of Charles between<br />\nLexington and Saratoga Streets,<br />\ndowntown. this stretch was<br />\npaved in 1971, at the suggestion<br />\nof Mayor Schaefer. Since then,<br />\nseventeen street sections have<br /><br />\nbeen repaved with glasphalt in<br />\nBaltimore. The lane in front of<br />\nthe MSE was done in September of 1984. Other cities, including New York, have also<br />\nused glasphalt in the past fifteen years.<br />\nGlasphalt is used only on<br />\nmain and secondary roads. It is<br />\nnot used on residential streets,<br />\nfor safety reasons. On busy<br />\nstreets, such as Charles, the<br />\nglass chips on the surface are<br />\nworn down within hours by the<br />\nheavy traffic flow. On quiet<br />\nresidential streets, however, it<br />\nwas feared that children playing in the street may be cut by<br />\nloose pieces of glass, before car<br />\ntires could smooth down the<br />\nsurface.<br />\nAlthough glasphalt was first<br />\nused for conservation, it is continued now purely for<br />\naesthetics. While citizens<br />\nbrought an excess of glass bottles to landfills for recycling in<br />\nthe early 1970's, now there is a<br />\nshortage. In order to use the<br />\nglass in the asphalt, it must first<br />\nbe \"cleaned.\" This procedure<br />\ninvolves removing, by hand, all<br />\n-the pieces of metal and paper<br />\nlabels from the bottles. Furthermore, only the opaque glass is<br />\nused in glasphalt; clear glass is<br />\nrecycled by the bottling com-<br /><br />\npanies. Thus, although glasphalt was originally intended to<br />\nsave money on the stone aggregate, which must be mined,<br />\nit ends up costing ten to fifteen<br />\ndollars more per ton. One ton<br />\nof asphalt translates into 18<br />\nsquare yards of pavement, one<br />\ninch thick. Therefore, since<br />\nseveral tons are needed to cover<br />\na two-to-three block area,<br />\nglasphalt is certainly not the<br />\nmost economical way of paving<br />\na street. An exception to this<br /><br />\nrule exists in the southern<br />\nUnited States, where stone is in<br />\nshort supply. Since stone must<br />\nbe shipped to the south from<br />\nthe northeast, the cost of<br />\nregular asphalt may be equal<br />\nto, or even more than, the cost<br />\nof glasphalt.<br />\nSo, why use glasphalt in<br />\nBaltimore? In short, because it<br />\nlooks nice. It is much more<br />\ncheerful to drive at night down<br />\na bright, sparkling street than<br />\na dull, gray asphalt one. Other<br /><br />\nthan the cost, there are no<br />\ndisadvantages to glasphalt. It<br />\nwears just well as regular<br />\nasphalt, it doesn't get any more<br />\nslippery in snow or rain, and is<br />\nno more prone to potholes. According to Kapplin, one or two<br />\nstreets will be done each year in<br />\nBaltimore, as the supply of<br />\nglass permits. Perhaps in ten<br />\nyears, when we come back to<br />\nvisit Hopkins, we may find that<br />\nall the streets leading here are<br />\nsparkling.<br /><br />\nTom Barthel<br /><br />\nThe Charles Street service lane, which sparkles from University Parkway to 29th Street.<br /><br />\nNEWS-LETTER/17<br /><br />\nResearch in AIDS<br />\nContinued from Page 16<br />\nthe immune system what to do,<br />\nhow well to do it, and when to<br />\nturn it off.\" They are the<br />\n\"primary coordinators\" of the<br />\nimmune system, and the<br />\nHTLV-3 virus \"homes in on<br />\nthese cells.\" HTLV-3 is an<br />\nRNA-virus; all its coding information is stored in RNA rather<br />\nthan DNA. To replicate in<br />\nhuman cells, the virus requires<br />\nthe enzyme reverse transcriptase to transcribe its genetic information into DNA which is<br />\nthen integrated with the T cell's<br />\nDNA. The virus may stay in a<br />\nsemi-quiescent state for a long<br />\nperiod, or, upon stimulation of<br />\nthe T cell, to grow and mature<br />\ninto a blast cell (perhaps due to<br />\nan infection or stress) the virus<br />\nmay begin to replicate in large<br />\nquantities.As the virus rapidly<br />\nreproduces, it kills its host T<br />\ncell, and its progeny are released and go on to invade other T<br />\ncells, thus debilitating the patient's immune system.<br />\nCurrent research is investigating drugs which inhibit<br />\nreverse transcriptase, and at<br />\nJohns Hopkins Medical<br />\nSchool, several studies are<br />\nunder way to study drugs that<br /><br />\ninhibit the virus at this level of<br />\nreplication. There is also current research on generating a<br />\nvaccine against AIDS. Unfortunately, this may not be very<br />\nfeasible because there are no<br />\nreliable animal models, and<br />\nbecause the virus seems to<br />\nmutate easily, thus making the<br />\neffectiveness of a vaccine more<br />\nquestionable. The development<br />\nof vaccines, according to<br />\nQuinn, will most likely be<br />\n\"many, many years in the<br />\nfuture.\" Quinn recommends<br />\nthat \"the best control of the<br />\ndisease will be through education of the public of the problem, how it can be contracted,<br />\nand how avoided.\"<br />\nMore information about<br />\nAIDS may be obtained from<br />\nThe Johns Hopkins Hospital,<br />\nDivision ofInfectious Diseases.<br />\n(301) 955-3150.
