This<br />\nplay tells the story of how Cuffs (played<br />\nby Chris Rousseau), a gay high school<br />\nstudent, comes out of the closet only to<br />\nbe subjected, at the insistance of his<br />\nparents, to unsavory psychotherapeutic<br />\nmethods in an attempt to \"cure\" his<br />\nhomosexuality. The result is a straight<br />\nmarriage frought with complications.<br />\nThe story unfolds through the flashbacks<br />\nof Jason (played by Doug Miller), a Gay<br />\nlawyer and Cuff's first lover.<br />\n\"Cuffs\" is a nickname (we never<br />\nlearn his real name) that refers to the<br />\nhandcuffs he wears at his belt. \"S and M,<br />\nhuh,\" Jason says, but Cuffs claims that<br />\nthey are just something he has always<br />\nworn. They have a deeper meaning, one<br />\nthat goes along with his fantasy about<br />\ncruising and being arrested by a vice-<br />\n<br />\nsquad ccp play-acting as a Gay.<br />\nThe play adapts its major technique from Peter Shaffer's \"Equus\", in<br />\nwhich the present action is blended with<br />\nthe action of a flashback - a device<br />\nappropriate for plays dealing with psychoanalysis and therapy. As one character recalls a scene to another character, it<br />\ncomes alive around them, drawing the<br />\nstory teller into its action. These scenes<br />\nare set within the larger framework of the<br />\nplay, which is made up of the reenacted<br />\nflashbacks of Jason. As his audience, we<br />\nplay the therapist - not the sort that<br />\nseeks to manipulate or analyze him,only<br />\nsympathetic listeners to his story.<br />\nHailer's direction of these complicated<br />\nscenes is tight and the play is fast-paced<br />\nas a result.<br />\nAs Jason, Doug Miller has a strong<br />\nlow-key stage presence throughout the<br />\nplay. He maintains the naturalness of an<br />\nexperienced lawyer before the courtroom. Chris Rousseau, by contrast, has a<br />\nstiff shyness well-suited for the character<br />\n<br />\nDoug Willer stars in sensitive portrayal of gay life.<br />\n<br />\nof Cuffs. Frank Kim brings the most<br />\nhumor to the play as the outrageous<br />\nqueen Chris, Cuffs' second lover, while<br />\nkeeping the character likable and believable. Lisa Ginsburg, Pat Madden, Richard<br />\nSeamon, and Linda Gardner are well cast<br />\nfor the other roles.<br />\nHaller has written a sensitive<br />\naccount of Gay life in mainstream America, a subject too often stereotyped or<br />\nLike Stuart Cohen's<br />\nsensationalized.<br />\nproduction of \"Downtown\" last Spring,.<br />\n\"Therapies\" is the outcome of dedicated<br />\nindependent work by a group of creative<br />\nstudents.<br />\nAfter the play, I talked with Chas<br />\nHaller, Frank Kim, and Katy Evans<br />\n(this year's president of the Barnstormers). They felt that the enthusiasm<br />\nfor theater among students and faculty<br />\njustified, almost necessitated, the formation of a drama department at Hopkins.<br />\nThis semester alone, we have seen the<br />\nproduction of \"Night Must Fall,\" \"Affects of Gamma Rays...,\" \"Anything<br />\nGoes,\" \"Therapies,\" and the initiation of<br />\n\"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest\" for<br />\nthe summer.<br />\nThe academic curriculum of Johns<br />\nHopkins is limited to the abstract realm<br />\nof language. It stretches from the extreme abstractions of mathematics and<br />\ncomputer languages to the Writing<br />\nSeminars' plain-speaking journalism and<br />\nsensual language of poetry. But the art of<br />\nlanguage is the boundary with the void.<br />\nIf Hopkins were to add a program in the<br />\narts, the next logical step would be<br />\ntheater - an art which uses language<br />\nvisibly and audibly to achieve its effect.<br />\nThe three students felt that the<br />\nraw materials for such an outgrowth<br />\nalready exist on campus. Professor<br />\nArellano's playwriting workshops . emphasize the production aspects of theater;<br />\nthe \"final exam\" for the course is the<br />\npublic presentation of several of the<br />\nplays. Professor Orgel of the English<br />\nDepartment is a specialist in Elizabethan<br />\ndrama, the most important area of<br />\ntheater history for a drama student to<br />\nstudy Professor Arrowsmith puts such a<br />\nhigh premium on the visual and audible<br />\n<br />\n111111111111111111111111111111111<br />\n<br />\n1<br />\n<br />\n01111111111111111111111111011<br />\n<br />\nexperience of Classical Greek drama that<br />\nhe perfroms one-man shows of scens and<br />\neven whole plays for his lectures Katy<br />\n-Evans said that a foundling theater<br />\nprogram would have to be a cooperative,<br />\ninterdepartmental effort of the humanities departments.<br />\nAlthough the establishment of a<br />\ndegree-granting program would take<br />\nmany years to develop, a theater concentration or minor could be possible in the<br />\nvery near future, much like the film<br />\nstudies concentration available in the<br />\nHumanities Center. A full degree program would require courses in acting,<br />\ndirecting, theater craft, drama history, and<br />\ndramatic literature (Haller added playwriting to the list), as well as the usual<br />\ndepartmental and university academic<br />\nrequirements.<br />\nA theater program, or at least a<br />\ncourse offering, would be an official<br />\nuniversity recognition of the enthusiastic<br />\nstudent efforts in the performing arts<br />\nexemplified by the Barnstormers and<br />\nplays like Chas Hailer's \"Therapies\".<br />\n<br />\nElections<br />\nAll Staff Members Can Vote<br />\nFree Refreshments Afterwards.<br />\nCourtesy of the Outgoing N-L Board<br />\nFriday (today!) at 4 p.m.<br />\n<br />\nAll Interested in the N-L Are Invited<br />\nCome to the Roscoe Riggs Memorial Cockfight!<br />\n<br />\nGunfight at Gatehouse corral.<br />\n<br />\n\fNEWS-LETTER/ PAGE 7<br />\n<br />\nLast Gasp For The Sleaze<br />\n<br />\nJHU Life a Masturbatory Fantasy<br />\n<br />\nMorrison wasn't the first who said<br />\nit, but I believe he said it best: \"This is<br />\nI'm whacking off in the Rat. the end,/my only friend, the end;/111<br />\nThat's what I'm doing right here in front never look into your eyes again.\" No,<br />\nof these people.

According to the<br />\nconductor, we would be an hour late into Philly, where<br />\neveryone except me appeared to be getting off. Once<br />\nagain, I repeated to myself the mantra from the Hopkins<br />\nDenver Alumni Meeting: \"Remember to tell the cabbie<br />\nto take you to the Homewood Campus, or else when<br />\nyou say 'Hopkins' he'll take you to the Med School,<br />\nwhich is in the ghetto and could be fatal. Oh, God.\"<br />\nI had spent most of the previous night in the<br />\ndome-car of The California Zephyr, sipping cokes and<br />\nwatching the darkness roll past. I was fine, just fine,<br />\nuntil about 4 a.m., when we clattered over the Mississippi. At that point I suddenly lost it. The brave facade<br />\ncrumbled like a stack of empty beer cans, and the true,<br />\nparalyzing, naked horror of LEAVING HOME hit<br />\nme.<br />\nI wanted my Mom.<br />\nI don't know if it was the combination of the<br />\ncokes inside me and the sight of Old Man River rolling<br />\nmuddily below, or what, but at that moment, for the<br />\nfirst time in a dozen years, I wet my pants.<br />\nTrial by water. My baptism into the faith<br />\nof Higher Education, with fluid befitting a freshman.<br />\nThus annointed, I arrived in the holy city of Baltimore, a<br />\nneophyte at the temple gates. Enlightenment would<br />\ncome slowly, if at all.<br />\n<br />\nClose Encounters<br />\nWhen lovely woman stoops to folly,<br />\nAnd finds too late that men betray,<br />\nWhat charm can soothe her melancholy?<br />\nWhat art can wash her guilt away?<br />\n--Oliver Goldsmith.<br />\nMartin was having a hard time of it. Each<br />\nafternoon we would sit together in Astrogut, listening<br />\nhalf-heartedly, and thinking more about what kind of<br />\ngastronomic monstrosity Servomation would be serving<br />\nup that night than about whether the sun was cooling<br />\noff or not. (To level headed chaps, clear and present<br />\ndangers always take priority.) And each class, without<br />\nfail, Martin would give me a progress report concerning<br />\nhis amorous exploits.<br />\nThe problem was this: Martin was in Love - or<br />\nrather, In Lust (the distinction between the two being<br />\nfrequently blurred during Freshman year.) Now the<br />\nobject of his affections was a cute little number on<br />\nthird-floor Royce who was, by all reports, equally enamored of him. As luck would have it, however, she had<br />\nbeen brought up in a form of Judaism which tended<br />\ntoward the orthodox, and hence religious taboos had so<br />\nfar prevented consumation. The poor tempted creature<br />\nseemed to transgress in cycles, and consequently my<br />\nbriefings from Martin varied from day to day. Some<br />\nafternoons he would tell of how they had teetered on<br />\nthe brink of Original Sin, while on others he had little to<br />\nreport beyond an evergrowing sense of frustration.<br />\nAt it happened, Martin's cautious concubine was<br />\nin my 9 a.m. Spanish class that semester, and I soon<br />\nbegan to observe an intriguing pattern. You see,she was<br />\nfond of wearing pieces of religious jewelry: Stars of<br />\nDavid, chais, etc., the amount and kind varying from day<br />\nto day. Varying...as I gradually came to notice, in a<br />\npattern practically identical with that of Martin's success<br />\nthe night before, infoanation of which I would receive<br />\nfrom him later in the day.<br />\nWhen she had kept his gropings to a minimum,<br />\nshe appeared with only a single cannonal accessory -- but<br />\nwhen she had faltered in her resolve, she piled it on in<br />\nproportion to the extent of her folly.

But as this last semester has<br />\nsped by (my last ever as a student, a creature freer than<br />\nmost birds), the tree and its proposed chopping began to<br />\ntake on a deeper meaning for me.<br />\n<br />\nI believe it was either Santayana or Mr. Goodwrench who once observed that many cataclysmic<br />\nmoments in history have occured in automobiles.<br />\nOffhand I can name the start of World War I,the assassination of John F. Kennedy, the conception of countless<br />\nbabies, and the moment when I first realized that<br />\nI was grown up. Details concerning the first three events<br />\nelude me, but since I was a witness to the fourth, I<br />\nconsider myself quite capable of expounding on that<br />\nportentous occasion. So I think I will.<br />\nAs I recall, my father was driving, my mother sat<br />\nobediently at his right, and I was hunched in the back<br />\nseat, staring blankly out the window. We were returning<br />\nfrom a doctor's appointment, although I forget which<br />\none of us had actually seen the doctor. It was probably<br />\nmy father, whose discs used to, and still do, slip more<br />\noften than Jerry Ford. I was 14 years old at the time,<br />\nand in a foul mood. Next to manufacturing zits, the<br />\nthing that 14-year-olds are best at is being moody.<br />\nHence my Hamletesque torpot.<br />\n<br />\nNext to manufacturing<br />\nzits, the thing<br />\n14-year-olds are best at<br />\nis being moody.<br />\n<br />\nI realized I was on the<br />\nother side. I was - ick grown up!<br />\nAll of a sudden, I noticed a car pulling up alongside ours. I watched it as it gradually passed us: tarnished chrome on the grill, muddy hubcaps,an Oldsmobile, a little rust on the door, and a very attractive lady<br />\nbehind the wheel. Casually she turned her head to see<br />\nwhom she was passing. Her gaze fell on me. Right on<br />\n<br />\nRetrospective<br />\nPerspective<br />\n<br />\nI began to fight for the tree's life. This has not<br />\nonly irked my parents, but it has also surprised them.<br />\nThey know I'm no nature nut. Far from it: insects<br />\nfrighten me more than armed muggers or the prospect<br />\nof Ronald Reagan in the White House. My hatred for<br />\ngetting sun-tanned is so intense that Coppertone and Q-T<br />\nhave me on their enemies lists.<br />\nWhy then, my parents have queried, are you so<br />\nhung up on this tree? Why indeed, I've asked myself. I<br />\nhave offered ostensible reasons like, \"It's such a beautiful and unique tree,\" \"That old maple keeps this house<br />\ncool in the summertime,\" and \"I hear that maples are<br />\nbecoming extinct.\" Though ostensible reasons, they're<br />\nall true, except, I admit,for the last one.<br />\nMy real reasons \u2014 the ones I've been too unwilling to tell my parents for fear of being laughed at or,<br />\neven worse, agreed with \u2014 have to do with my reluctance to shelve all the wild, sad, sweet, funny, dull,<br />\nwonderful things of my first 22 years (with which I have<br />\n<br />\nANGST FOR THE MEMORIES<br />\ncue, and despite my bilious disposition, I reacted as I<br />\nusually did whenever I spotted a pulchritudinous member of the female persuasion in another car. I gave her<br />\nmy patented, guaranteed-to-slay-'em, cute-but-racyraised-eyebrow -Charles-Boyer leer. Horny but not too<br />\nfar from innocence.<br />\nAs I said, the shtick was guaranteed. Every<br />\nwoman, particularly evenz_.\u2014er woman, who received<br />\nmy prize-winning ogle automatically ogled me right<br />\nback. Every woman, that is, until the lady in the Olds.<br />\nShe gave me a look that would have wilted a sequoia.<br />\nThe only previous time I had ever seen such a scowl was<br />\non my mother's face when my somewhat blotto father<br />\npinched Mrs. Bielski's derriere at a New Year's Eve<br />\nparty. Mr. Bielski had a rear end that, in the words of<br />\nGrouch\u00b0 Marx, you could play pinochle on.<br />\n- Anyway, getting back to the Olds lady. The<br />\nwoman had obviously taken me for some kind of little<br />\nleague lech. I was shocked, crushed, offended. What<br />\nhad gone wrong? Was it me or was it just her? As it<br />\nturned out, it couldn't have been just her because when<br />\none week later I tried my come-hither look on another<br />\nwoman in a passing auto, I was once again given the<br />\nhairy eyeballs. The go-thither look.<br />\nIt was me. It finally dawned on my poor pubescent brain that I was no longer a cute little kid whose<br />\namorous winks evoked giggles and air mail kisses from<br />\nladies who were old enough to be my mother. (Freud<br />\nwould've loved me!) Imagine my chagrin, nay my<br />\nhorror, goodly reader, when I realized that I was now on<br />\nthe other side. I was-- ick! \u2014grown up!<br />\n<br />\nLife seems to work that way, often putting the<br />\nmore significant moments of one's existence into symbols which are at oncy tidy and memorable. I regard the<br />\nincident with the Olds lady as the unofficial end of my<br />\nchildhood. The official end of my Wonder Years \u2014 and,<br />\nconversely, the commencement of my Rat Race Years<br />\n(onto beggar and bitter things) supposedly comes now<br />\nwith college graduation.<br />\nI don't mean to suggest, however, that donning a<br />\ndumpy gown and walking across a rented stage to shake<br />\nhands with a perfect, albeit perfectly tanned,stranger is<br />\none of those memorable symbols. Your standard<br />\ngraduation ceremony lacks drama, real emotion, or<br />\nwhatever it is that constitutes a good symbol.(Commencement exercises they're called! It sounds as if we're all<br />\n<br />\nby<br />\nP<br />\n<br />\n\u2022<br />\n<br />\natrick.. Ercolano<br />\n<br />\ngoing to jog onto Gilman Quad and do some jumping<br />\njacks and squats.)<br />\nMy own symbol for this peculiar phase stands in<br />\nmy back yard in northeast Baltimore. It's a maple tree<br />\nthat was planted a year or two after I was born. Unfortunately, the branches are getting tangled in the telephone wires that hang overhead, and the roots are<br />\ncausing the patio to crack. Thus my parents, at the<br />\neager though appropriately solemn urgings of the Baltimore Gas and Electric Company (which owns the<br />\ntelephone wires), have decided it's time to cut down the<br />\ntree.<br />\n<br />\ncome to associate the maple in our back yard). I have<br />\npictures of the tree and me, circa 1960, both of us mere<br />\nsaplings; 7-year-old me building a snow fort around<br />\nthe tree; 12-year-old me making my fist foray up into<br />\nthe branches; 21-year-old me standing next to the tree<br />\non my birthday. Chopping down the tree would be, in<br />\neffect, chopping down my childhood, cutting it into<br />\nportable pieces and saving them for some cold night by<br />\nthe fireplace.<br />\nMeanwhile, the maple tree stands in the back<br />\nyard like a prisoner on death row. The men from the<br />\nBaltimore Gas and Electric Company were supposed<br />\nto cut it down last week, but so far they haven't gotten<br />\naround to our yard. They will, sooner or later, I know<br />\nthat. I just hope they don't come to do it on the day of<br />\nmy graduation.

The budget includes<br />\na planned deficit of $549,000.<br />\nThe budgeted deficit for the<br />\ncurrent year ending June 30,<br />\n1980 is $1.2 million, although a<br />\nsmaller actual deficit is expected<br />\nby the time the books are<br />\nclosed. A three-year budget plan<br />\nintroduced last year called for a<br />\napproximately<br />\nof<br />\ndeficit<br />\n$250,000 for the coming year,<br />\nand a return to financail equilibrium by 1981-82.

It is worth noting,<br />\nhowever, that the 1971 budget<br />\nfor the University was $96<br />\nmillion, and that next year's<br /><br />\nbudget in constant 1971 dollars<br />\nis only $106 million.<br />\nOf the total University<br />\nbudget for 1980-81, $120.5<br />\nmillion represents general University funds, an increase of 16.8<br />\npercent over 1979-80. Expenditures in the form of sponsored<br />\nresearch and other externally<br />\nfunded programs are expected to<br />\nreach $108.1 million, an increase<br />\nof 10 percent from the current<br />\nyear.<br />\nOn the expenditure side, the<br />\nlargest items in the general funds<br />\nbudget include instruction and<br />\nresearch($34.9 million); clinical<br />\nservice activities ($23.1 million);<br />\ngeneral services and administration ($ 16.8 million); operation<br />\nand plant maintenance ($16.1<br />\nmillion); student aid ($11.3<br />\nmillion) and libraries ($5.1 million).<br />\nThe divisions of Homewood<br />\nFaculties, Arts and Sciences,<br />\nEngineering, Academic Centers<br />\nand Support Services, and the<br />\nEvening College have a combined 1980-81 budget of $55.4<br />\nmillion, including $39.9 million<br />\nfrom University general funds<br />\nand $15.5 million from sponsored research, training and other<br />\nprograms.<br />\nAlso included in the University's overall budget is the<br />\nPeabody Institute.

Dreary as Hell.<br />\nI had awakened in the midst of the Pennsylvania<br />\nDutch country, with pentangles on barn-gables flashing by<br />\nthe window like rolling poker chips. According to the<br />\nconductor, we would be an hour late into Philly, where<br />\neveryone except me appeared to be getting off. Once<br />\nagain, I repeated to myself the mantra from the Hopkins<br />\nDenver Alumni Meeting: \"Remember to tell the cabbie<br />\nto take you to the Homewood Campus, or else when<br />\nyou say 'Hopkins' he'll take you to the Med School,<br />\nwhich is in the ghetto and could be fatal. Oh, God.\"<br />\nI had spent most of the previous night in the<br />\ndome-car of The California Zephyr, sipping cokes and<br />\nwatching the darkness roll past. I was fine, just fine,<br />\nuntil about 4 a.m., when we clattered over the Mississippi. At that point I suddenly lost it. The brave facade<br />\ncrumbled like a stack of empty beer cans, and the true,<br />\nparalyzing, naked horror of LEAVING HOME hit<br />\nme.<br />\nI wanted my Mom.<br />\nI don't know if it was the combination of the<br />\ncokes inside me and the sight of Old Man River rolling<br />\nmuddily below, or what, but at that moment, for the<br />\nfirst time in a dozen years, I wet my pants.<br />\nTrial by water. My baptism into the faith<br />\nof Higher Education, with fluid befitting a freshman.<br />\nThus annointed, I arrived in the holy city of Baltimore, a<br />\nneophyte at the temple gates. Enlightenment would<br />\ncome slowly, if at all.<br /><br />\nClose Encounters<br />\nWhen lovely woman stoops to folly,<br />\nAnd finds too late that men betray,<br />\nWhat charm can soothe her melancholy?<br />\nWhat art can wash her guilt away?<br />\n--Oliver Goldsmith.<br />\nMartin was having a hard time of it. Each<br />\nafternoon we would sit together in Astrogut, listening<br />\nhalf-heartedly, and thinking more about what kind of<br />\ngastronomic monstrosity Servomation would be serving<br />\nup that night than about whether the sun was cooling<br />\noff or not. (To level headed chaps, clear and present<br />\ndangers always take priority.) And each class, without<br />\nfail, Martin would give me a progress report concerning<br />\nhis amorous exploits.<br />\nThe problem was this: Martin was in Love - or<br />\nrather, In Lust (the distinction between the two being<br />\nfrequently blurred during Freshman year.) Now the<br />\nobject of his affections was a cute little number on<br />\nthird-floor Royce who was, by all reports, equally enamored of him. As luck would have it, however, she had<br />\nbeen brought up in a form of Judaism which tended<br />\ntoward the orthodox, and hence religious taboos had so<br />\nfar prevented consumation. The poor tempted creature<br />\nseemed to transgress in cycles, and consequently my<br />\nbriefings from Martin varied from day to day. Some<br />\nafternoons he would tell of how they had teetered on<br />\nthe brink of Original Sin, while on others he had little to<br />\nreport beyond an evergrowing sense of frustration.<br />\nAt it happened, Martin's cautious concubine was<br />\nin my 9 a.m. Spanish class that semester, and I soon<br />\nbegan to observe an intriguing pattern. You see,she was<br />\nfond of wearing pieces of religious jewelry: Stars of<br />\nDavid, chais, etc., the amount and kind varying from day<br />\nto day. Varying...as I gradually came to notice, in a<br />\npattern practically identical with that of Martin's success<br />\nthe night before, infoanation of which I would receive<br />\nfrom him later in the day.<br />\nWhen she had kept his gropings to a minimum,<br />\nshe appeared with only a single cannonal accessory -- but<br />\nwhen she had faltered in her resolve, she piled it on in<br />\nproportion to the extent of her folly. As she stooped,so<br />\ntoo did she glitter. It was as if all those religious knickknacks would divert the thunderbolt which her conscience expected promptly from On High.<br />\nI loved it. I always felt a stir of pleasure when<br />\nmy prediction based on her level of Judaic jewelry was<br />\n.. verified by the verbal report in the afternoon. It was an<br /><br />\nGoodbye Tc<br />\nDAYS OF -WINE<br />\nby Gates<br />\ninfallible system, and once, when Martin's story didn't<br />\njive with my morning observations, I even shamed him<br />\ninto admitting that he had fibbed.<br />\nBut Martin was worried. Apparently Sha Na Na<br />\nor some other Jewish holiday was fast approaching, and<br />\nhe feared that if she was not corrupted before it arrived,<br />\nhis wet dreams would be set back by at least three<br />\nmonths. The Big Push was on.<br />\nBefore long, things were looking pretty good, for<br />\nhis girlfriend showed up in Espanol carrying an everincreasing burden of dogmatic decoration. Then, just<br />\nscant days before the holiday, the Apple was bitten.<br />\nI actually heard her that morning before I<br />\nsaw her, clanking down the hallway like a rusty Sherman<br />\ntank, or some penitential shade dragging chains in a<br />\nboneyard. There she was - from necklace to rings to<br />\nankle bracelet, she looked like a Hasidic curio shop. As<br />\nthe metallic maiden plunked down across from me, I<br />\nflashed her the most lascivious, lecherous, all-knowing<br />\ngrin I could muster, causing a crimson flush to immediately envelop her face.<br />\nLater that day I went to the drugstore, bought<br />\nMartin a fine cigar, and met him with a slap on the back<br />\nat the door to Astrogut, offering my congratulations<br />\nbefore he could get a word,out. \"But she swore me to<br />\nsecrecy!\" he protested. \"How the Hell did you find out<br />\nso quickly. She said that if anyone else found out she'd<br />\nnever see me again!\"<br />\n\"But Martin,\" I protested, \"it's all over campus.<br />\nI heard it from three different people just on the way to<br />\nthis class.\" He hung his head in his hands and began to<br />\nmoan.<br />\nAlright, alright -- so I was a title jealous.<br /><br />\nSuch arguments are admittedly enticing, especially for someone who was known as the Strikeout King of<br />\nthe Freshman Dorms, but the para-military hierarchy,<br />\nthe official gung-ho filmstrip we were shown later in the<br />\nbasement, and the sight of several shell-shocked brothers<br />\nwho shared the same nervous twitch of the facial muscles, dissuaded me in the end. There was just something<br />\nfishy about the whole operation. This frat had a \"special deal\" with a downtown distributor of something<br />\ncalled \"Joe's Ideal Beer\", which forbade them from<br />\nselling anything else at their social affairs. Not only did<br />\n\"Joe's Ideal Beer\" taste like week-old weasel piss (they<br />\ndrew it out of Tuborg taps to try and fool people), but I<br />\nthink it was also responsible for the neurological epidemic previously mentioned.

But as this last semester has<br />\nsped by (my last ever as a student, a creature freer than<br />\nmost birds), the tree and its proposed chopping began to<br />\ntake on a deeper meaning for me.<br /><br />\nI believe it was either Santayana or Mr. Goodwrench who once observed that many cataclysmic<br />\nmoments in history have occured in automobiles.<br />\nOffhand I can name the start of World War I,the assassination of John F.

So I think I will.<br />\nAs I recall, my father was driving, my mother sat<br />\nobediently at his right, and I was hunched in the back<br />\nseat, staring blankly out the window. We were returning<br />\nfrom a doctor's appointment, although I forget which<br />\none of us had actually seen the doctor. It was probably<br />\nmy father, whose discs used to, and still do, slip more<br />\noften than Jerry Ford. I was 14 years old at the time,<br />\nand in a foul mood.

I was - ick grown up!<br />\nAll of a sudden, I noticed a car pulling up alongside ours. I watched it as it gradually passed us: tarnished chrome on the grill, muddy hubcaps,an Oldsmobile, a little rust on the door, and a very attractive lady<br />\nbehind the wheel. Casually she turned her head to see<br />\nwhom she was passing. Her gaze fell on me. Right on<br /><br />\nRetrospective<br />\nPerspective<br /><br />\nI began to fight for the tree's life. This has not<br />\nonly irked my parents, but it has also surprised them.<br />\nThey know I'm no nature nut. Far from it: insects<br />\nfrighten me more than armed muggers or the prospect<br />\nof Ronald Reagan in the White House. My hatred for<br />\ngetting sun-tanned is so intense that Coppertone and Q-T<br />\nhave me on their enemies lists.<br />\nWhy then, my parents have queried, are you so<br />\nhung up on this tree? Why indeed, I've asked myself. I<br />\nhave offered ostensible reasons like, \"It's such a beautiful and unique tree,\" \"That old maple keeps this house<br />\ncool in the summertime,\" and \"I hear that maples are<br />\nbecoming extinct.\" Though ostensible reasons, they're<br />\nall true, except, I admit,for the last one.<br />\nMy real reasons \u2014 the ones I've been too unwilling to tell my parents for fear of being laughed at or,<br />\neven worse, agreed with \u2014 have to do with my reluctance to shelve all the wild, sad, sweet, funny, dull,<br />\nwonderful things of my first 22 years (with which I have<br /><br />\nANGST FOR THE MEMORIES<br />\ncue, and despite my bilious disposition, I reacted as I<br />\nusually did whenever I spotted a pulchritudinous member of the female persuasion in another car. I gave her<br />\nmy patented, guaranteed-to-slay-'em, cute-but-racyraised-eyebrow -Charles-Boyer leer. Horny but not too<br />\nfar from innocence.<br />\nAs I said, the shtick was guaranteed. Every<br />\nwoman, particularly evenz_.\u2014er woman, who received<br />\nmy prize-winning ogle automatically ogled me right<br />\nback. Every woman, that is, until the lady in the Olds.<br />\nShe gave me a look that would have wilted a sequoia.<br />\nThe only previous time I had ever seen such a scowl was<br />\non my mother's face when my somewhat blotto father<br />\npinched Mrs. Bielski's derriere at a New Year's Eve<br />\nparty. Mr. Bielski had a rear end that, in the words of<br />\nGrouch\u00b0 Marx, you could play pinochle on.<br />\n- Anyway, getting back to the Olds lady. The<br />\nwoman had obviously taken me for some kind of little<br />\nleague lech. I was shocked, crushed, offended. What<br />\nhad gone wrong? Was it me or was it just her? As it<br />\nturned out, it couldn't have been just her because when<br />\none week later I tried my come-hither look on another<br />\nwoman in a passing auto, I was once again given the<br />\nhairy eyeballs. The go-thither look.<br />\nIt was me. It finally dawned on my poor pubescent brain that I was no longer a cute little kid whose<br />\namorous winks evoked giggles and air mail kisses from<br />\nladies who were old enough to be my mother. (Freud<br />\nwould've loved me!) Imagine my chagrin, nay my<br />\nhorror, goodly reader, when I realized that I was now on<br />\nthe other side. I was-- ick! \u2014grown up!<br /><br />\nLife seems to work that way, often putting the<br />\nmore significant moments of one's existence into symbols which are at oncy tidy and memorable. I regard the<br />\nincident with the Olds lady as the unofficial end of my<br />\nchildhood. The official end of my Wonder Years \u2014 and,<br />\nconversely, the commencement of my Rat Race Years<br />\n(onto beggar and bitter things) supposedly comes now<br />\nwith college graduation.<br />\nI don't mean to suggest, however, that donning a<br />\ndumpy gown and walking across a rented stage to shake<br />\nhands with a perfect, albeit perfectly tanned,stranger is<br />\none of those memorable symbols. Your standard<br />\ngraduation ceremony lacks drama, real emotion, or<br />\nwhatever it is that constitutes a good symbol.(Commencement exercises they're called! It sounds as if we're all<br /><br />\nby<br />\nP<br /><br />\n\u2022<br /><br />\natrick.. Ercolano<br /><br />\ngoing to jog onto Gilman Quad and do some jumping<br />\njacks and squats.)<br />\nMy own symbol for this peculiar phase stands in<br />\nmy back yard in northeast Baltimore. It's a maple tree<br />\nthat was planted a year or two after I was born. Unfortunately, the branches are getting tangled in the telephone wires that hang overhead, and the roots are<br />\ncausing the patio to crack. Thus my parents, at the<br />\neager though appropriately solemn urgings of the Baltimore Gas and Electric Company (which owns the<br />\ntelephone wires), have decided it's time to cut down the<br />\ntree.<br /><br />\ncome to associate the maple in our back yard). I have<br />\npictures of the tree and me, circa 1960, both of us mere<br />\nsaplings; 7-year-old me building a snow fort around<br />\nthe tree; 12-year-old me making my fist foray up into<br />\nthe branches; 21-year-old me standing next to the tree<br />\non my birthday. Chopping down the tree would be, in<br />\neffect, chopping down my childhood, cutting it into<br />\nportable pieces and saving them for some cold night by<br />\nthe fireplace.<br />\nMeanwhile, the maple tree stands in the back<br />\nyard like a prisoner on death row. The men from the<br />\nBaltimore Gas and Electric Company were supposed<br />\nto cut it down last week, but so far they haven't gotten<br />\naround to our yard. They will, sooner or later, I know<br />\nthat. I just hope they don't come to do it on the day of<br />\nmy graduation.
