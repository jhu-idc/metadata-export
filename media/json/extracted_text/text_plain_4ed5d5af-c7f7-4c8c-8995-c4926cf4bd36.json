Circulation 6000.<br />\n<br />\nStudent Council Furniture<br />\nThe Student Council is buying new furniture for its office. For no reason at all.<br />\nOriginally, Council President Maureen<br />\nFreed proposed that a new secretarial desk,<br />\n10 stacking chairs, two executive desk chairs,<br />\nand a small conference table should be purchased for $1000. And the reason for buying the 14 pieces of furniture would be to<br />\nmake the office functional. Again.<br />\nLast year's Council, however, never complained that their office wasn't functional.<br />\nAnd thus never requested new furniture.<br />\nSo. what were Freed's reasons for the proposed $1000 expenditure?<br />\nThe secretarial desk is too small; it only<br />\nhas enough room for a typewriter. The present executive desk chair is broken. There<br />\naren't enough chairs. And there isn't a small<br />\nconference table in the office, only a long<br />\ntable where the stencil machine and the<br />\nGestetner rest.<br />\nSecretarial work, especially Council secretarial work, doesn't necessarily have to be<br />\ndone at the secretarial desk.<br />\nThe executive desk chair can be repaired.<br />\n<br />\nNo more stacking chairs are needed on<br />\ncampus.<br />\nAnd a conference table just isn't necessary.

Dr. Stoskopf, who is<br />\nalso an assistant professor of<br />\ncomparative medicine at the<br />\nKennedy Institute of the Johns<br />\nHopkins School of Medecine,<br />\nhas participated and is participating in several major<br />\nresearch projects at the<br />\naquarium. Among these are<br />\nstudies that seek to find out the<br />\neffeetc of antibiotics on sharks<br />\nand invertebrates, the effects of<br />\nthe stress of captivity on<br />\nphysiology and disease in<br />\ndolphins and fish, the interrelations and interactions of the<br />\npublic and the animals at the<br />\naquarium, and the anatomy of<br />\npelicans and sharks.<br />\nWith all of these projects and<br />\nprograms that are centered<br />\naround the aquarium, many<br />\npeople at the National Aquarium<br />\nexpressed the idea that the<br />\naquarium has grown quickly<br />\nand grown to be strong. As Dr.<br />\nStoskopf indicated, \"Even<br />\nthough it is only two years old<br />\nit is a leader in science and<br />\nmarine research . . .contributing<br />\nvery heavily to the field.\" People at the aquarium also conveyed a sense of never being<br />\nsatisfied with the accomplished,<br />\nof being eager to achieve more<br />\nand likewise, of being very incited about the maturing of the<br />\naquarium.<br />\n<br />\nDiana Spencer, the director<br />\nof the Aquadopt program explained that a program to support the aquarium's animal<br />\npopulation existed before the<br />\naquarium even opened, in<br />\nAugust 1981. In November<br />\n1982 the present Aquadopt program for animals was started.<br />\nThis rekindling of the idea for<br />\nthe public's support was marked by a special event where<br />\nSugar Ray Leonard \"adopted\"<br />\na Southern Sting Ray from the<br />\nOpen Ocean Tank. As the last<br />\nfiscal year the aquarium had<br />\nover 900 people support this<br />\nprogram and there are as Diana<br />\nSpencer said,\"proud parents in<br />\n44 States.\" People very often<br />\nchoose animals that may 'send<br />\na message' to the person for<br />\nwhom they are adopted. Such<br />\nis the case when people<br />\n\"adopt\" grunts (Blue Stripe,<br />\nCaesar's, Cottonwick, French,<br />\nSmall Mouth, or White) for<br />\nFather's Day. Diana Spencer<br />\nnoted that the Aquadopt program owes part of its success to<br />\npeople who \"adopt\" animals<br />\nand plants for people they<br />\nknow in other states and even<br />\nother countries. The Aquadopt<br />\nprogram was, until this last<br />\nspring, limited to just the<br />\n\"adoption\" of animals.

According to Dr.<br />\nLennox Cowie, the liason between the Space Telescope Institute and Johns Hopkins, the<br />\nfive instruments that will be<br />\naboard the telescope are being<br />\nbuilt at The California Institute<br />\nof Technology, Goddard Space<br />\nFlight Center, The University<br />\nof San Diego, the European<br />\nSpace Agency, and the University of Wisconsin. All the instruments are to be tested at<br />\nGoddard.<br />\nPhysics professor Arthur<br />\nDavidsen was responsible for<br />\nbringing the Space Telescope to<br />\nHopkins. A number of proposals for the institute were received by NASA. Dr. Davidsen's proposal was the one accepted. The other final proposal was to build the Space Telescope Institute at Princeton<br />\nUniversity. But, according to<br />\nCowie, there has not been much<br />\ninvolvement of any universities,<br />\nnot even Hopkins. However, in<br />\n.the coming years there will be<br />\nmore contact between The<br />\nSpace Telescope Institute and<br />\nJohns Hopkins.<br />\nBy January of 1984, two people from The Space Telescope<br />\nInstitute are to become full professors in the Physics department with 50% appointments.<br />\nOne of these people is Dr.<br />\nCowie, who presently holds the<br />\nstatus of visiting scientist. One<br />\nof the primary reasons for the<br />\njoint appointments will be to<br />\nteach graduate courses. Students will be involved to a great<br />\ndegree. The staff members of<br />\nthe institute have their individual research, and there is<br />\ntherefore, as Dr. Cowie says,<br />\n\"a crying need for students.\"<br />\nStudents will do research, even<br />\ntheses relating to the Space<br />\nTelescope. All of this will start<br />\nup slowly, but will gradually increase. In the future, the staff<br />\nat the institute will even help<br />\nteach undergraduate astronomy<br />\ncourses.<br />\nThe Physics department will<br />\ngreatly expand in the area of<br />\nastrophysics. The institute will<br />\nemploy more than one hundred<br />\npeople, thirty of whom will be<br />\nscientific staff. (That's a very<br />\nlarge number of astrophysicists<br />\nto be in one place.) Although<br />\nHopkins only holds the status<br />\nof \"guest observer institution,\"<br />\nDr. Cowie feels that it is inevitable that JHU will become<br />\na leader in astrophysics; it is<br />\n<br />\n\"almost a truism.\" Hopkins had,<br />\nbeen a leader in the field of<br />\nPhysics in the 1920's, and JHU<br />\nwill assuredly be a leader once<br />\nagain, but this time the Physics<br />\ndepartment will probably hold<br />\non to such a reputation for a<br />\nmuch greater period of time.<br />\nCowie said that in thirty to<br />\nforty years from now, there will<br />\nbe a \"substantial probability\"<br />\nthat Hopkins will be a leader in<br />\nPhysics.<br />\nThe astrophysicists already in<br />\nthe Physics department who are<br />\nnot part of the institute do not<br />\nhave a favored status.

Clark<br />\nAlthough the impressive and<br />\ncostly renovation of the freshman dorms here at Hopkins<br />\nhave attracted quite a bit of attention, they have not overshadowed the cosmetic improvements that have excited<br />\nthose that frequent, and have<br />\nsparked the interest of others<br />\nin, the Grad Club.<br />\nIt all started in 1964; a plan<br />\nto create a student center at the<br />\nsocially barren and Rathskeller-less Hopkins Campus, primarily for Graduate students.<br />\n,<br />\nThe space in the basement of<br />\nthe recently purchased apartment building, McCoy, was<br />\nsuggested. It was one room and<br />\na kitchen, dry but comfortable<br />\n(it would be two years until the<br />\nClub would receive its license to<br />\nserve liquor). With money<br />\ngained from profits and provided by the University, the Grad<br />\nClub would expand to its present three rooms. Painfully informal; the place for many to<br />\ngo when desperate: the \"Sad<br />\nClub\". Although it never really lacked in its ability to support<br />\nitself, the Grad Club was not<br />\nfrequented by a number of students because of its unattractiveness. Until, prompted by<br />\nthe slow business of the summer months, new managers,<br />\nLarry Klein and Jerry Macdonald decided it was about<br />\ntime the Grad Club became<br />\n\"civilized\".<br />\n\"Every Saturday night at<br />\nleast we'd come to the Grad<br />\nClub,\" remarked one student,<br />\n\"They've always had good<br />\nbeer.\"<br />\nHowever: \"Never, no I think<br />\nI was down there once freshman year,\" said another, \"I'm<br />\na senior now.\" Both students<br />\nwere interviewed at the new and<br />\ndifferent Grad Club.<br />\nThe first student has returned<br />\nto Hopkins for the fall discovering that the Club has become<br />\nmore than a place to get a good<br />\nimport for cheap; the other has<br />\n<br />\nfound the Grad Club no longer graduate student studying<br />\ntoo sleazy to endure.

The income<br />\nis now mostly based on the purchase of food.<br />\nAlso part of the plan for<br />\ncivilizing the Grad Club is the<br />\ngeneral improvement of the<br />\nfare.<br />\n\"We've just added kosher<br />\nhot dogs and they're going over<br />\nbig, Klein said.\"Now we'd also<br />\nlike to improve the menu in<br />\ngeneral\u2014maybe get better coffee.\" Klein and Macdonald<br />\nplan to use the microwave oven<br />\nto broaden the selection and<br />\nimprove the service of Grad<br />\n<br />\nox a s character t<br />\ngested that we \"Nuke the<br />\nJuke\".<br />\n\"If it's those weirdos who<br />\ncome in here to play bridge,\"<br />\nthe same student added, \"I<br />\ndon't think they'll get much<br />\nattention.\"<br />\n\"We're a non-profit business<br />\nhere,\" Klein said, \"a service to<br />\nprovide for everybody. The<br />\nGrad Club isn't any one<br />\ngroup's private -space.\"<br />\nThe Grad Club, as previously mentioned, was founded for<br />\nthe pleasure and entertainment<br />\nof Hopkins Graduate Students.<br />\nHowever, its creation was not<br />\nselfish, and everybody is<br />\nwelcome.<br />\n\"We wanted to make this<br />\nplacoas civilized and appealing<br />\nas possible,\" Klein added, \"not<br />\nthat business was terrible, but<br />\nwe wanted to make it nicer for<br />\ngrad students, less offensive,<br />\nmore sophisticated.

A compensation for those that cannot<br />\ntake advantage of the inexpensive beer.<br />\nThe remainder of the entertainment, live music, will be<br />\norganized by the G.R.O., affiliated with the Grad Club.<br />\nMacdonaled did, however,<br />\nmention something about a<br />\ncont. on p. 12<br />\n<br />\n\f12/SEPTEMBER 23, 1983<br />\n<br />\nRoughing it in Off Campus Housing<br />\nby Judy Peale<br />\nSomewhere in the semidarkness, a doberman is barking.

What year is this? Does Mrs.<br />\nVan Norman know there's a<br />\ndog in the dorm?!<br />\nWait a minute, it's all coming back to me now. I'm not in<br />\nthe dorm, am I?

There, he<br />\nis tormented and debased to his<br />\nfinal point of desperation, during which he goes the same unl'ortunate route as the animals<br />\nlying fried in the front yard. He<br />\nwas an average and well-meaning kind of guy. In the final act,<br />\nthe supposedly weak one is destroyed, while the embittered,<br />\nself-serving survivalist unit lives<br />\nwith dignity intact.<br />\nThe disconnected plot is<br />\ncompensated for by the colorful rantings of the characters.<br />\nThey are a family of quirky,<br />\nbitter survivalists who live by<br />\nthe Darwinian principle in a<br />\nsociety run on a system of martial law. Grandfa,(Bob Eder),<br />\nfights the overall mood of,<br />\nmalevolence. He wheels in with<br />\nthe complaint, \"They hid my<br />\nteeth in a God damn cookie<br />\njar!\" He is the only likeable<br />\ncharacter. He develops his role<br />\nas the collective conscience of<br />\nthis perturbed family with a<br />\ngood mix of subtlety and<br />\nenergy.<br />\nThe portrayal of Ruby,(Darlene Kelley), has energy, but the<br />\nsubtlety was lacking. Kate,<br />\nShakespeare's shrew, is a<br />\nsweetheart compared to this<br />\nwoman. Kelley would be more<br />\neffective it' she lowered the<br />\ndecibels occasionally, but she<br />\noverpowers everyone else with<br />\nher venomous relationship with<br />\nthe audience. A couple of<br />\nRuby's gems: \"Who would<br />\nhave thought the old man to<br />\n<br />\nhave so much salt in him?\"<br />\nAlso,\"We shall not inherit the<br />\nEarth, for it has already disinherited us.\" In general,<br />\nKelley's performance of this<br />\nmegalomaniacal woman is<br />\npowerful and not easily forgotten.<br />\nSigfrid, (John Blair), is<br />\nRuby's bisexual son. He does a<br />\n.good job of being unlikeable.<br />\nClarence, (Tom Buckley), is<br />\nSigfrid's current sex partner.<br />\nBuckley play the part of this ineffectual political dissident with<br />\nsensitivity and excellence,<br />\nLakme,(Jennifer Donelan), is<br />\nRuby's precocious daughter.<br />\nShe also does a good job of being unlikeable. The acting,<br />\noverall, is polished. The<br />\ndialogue is entertaining, but it<br />\nleads nowhere.<br />\nThe problem is the script<br />\nitself. One is left hanging; there<br />\nis no real conclusion to the<br />\ndisconnected sequence of<br />\ndialogues and the one major<br />\nevent. There is no central conflict, only a series of observations. After the show, one of<br />\nthe stage assistants commented,<br />\n\"In the first act, things are a little confused. In the second act,<br />\nthe death clears things up a little. In the third act, their reactions make things confused<br />\nagain.\" The fault lies not<br />\nwithin the production itself, but<br />\nwithin the script. All the seemingly meaningful clues were<br />\nnever strung together, thus<br />\nmaking it difficult to derive<br />\nanything cohesive or worthwhile to carry away and<br />\nremember after the show.<br />\n<br />\nby Tara Peattie<br />\n<br />\n\"One of the qualities of the<br />\nFells Point Theatre is that there<br />\ncertainly isn't a bad seat in the<br />\nplace,\" Al Tyler comments<br />\nwryly. The tiny, quaint Fells<br />\nPoint Theatre(FPT)celebrates<br />\nits tenth anniversary this<br />\nmonth, and Tyler is its faithful<br />\nmentor. He co-founded the<br />\ntheatre and currently manages<br />\nand directs its productions. He<br />\nlooks like the archetypal director. His countenance is austere<br />\nand distinguished, his eyes are<br />\nbright, his white hair and<br />\nmoustache are disordered. He<br />\nwears shabby jeans and a flannel shirt. He chain smokes and<br />\ndrinks Chocolate Royale soda,<br />\nand, in between these indulgences, he waves his arms dramatically, implementing his<br />\ndiscussion.<br />\nThe theatre itself is a rather<br />\nugly edifice squashed onto the<br />\ncorner of Broadway and Shakespeare in this picturesque PolishItalian section of Baltimore.<br />\n\"We're fortunate in that we<br />\ncan't get a better address,\"<br />\nTyler comments, but he does<br />\nhave a few complaints. For<br />\none, he would like a bigger place.<br />\nThe theatre only seats fifty people, and the backstage is almost<br />\nnonexistent. Because of the<br />\nstage limitations, they seldom<br />\nhave more than one set. Despite<br />\nthis, they have a reputation in<br />\nBaltimore community theatre<br />\nfor having had some of the<br />\nmost imaginative sets.<br />\nOver the past ten years, the<br />\nFPT has tried a bit of everything. \"We've done Neil<br />\n444000000004 Simon, Tennessee Williams,<br />\n<br />\nShakespeare, and lately we're<br />\nleaning toward modern, offbeat stuff.\" Tyler takes suggestions from his assistants and<br />\nmanagers, and then makes the<br />\nfinal decisions on what plays<br />\nwill be performed himself. He<br />\nobserves of his recent productions of modern plays, \"You<br />\ncan hardly get a newer play that<br />\ndoesn't deal with homosexuality.\" He is careful that the ones<br />\nthe FPT puts on are enjoyable<br />\nand relevant for anyone. P.S.,<br />\nYour Cat is Dead was a record<br />\nbreaking money maker for<br />\nthem last year. Other recent<br />\nsuccesses have been The Boys in<br />\nthe Band, Fortune in Man's<br />\nEyes, and My Fat Friend. Their<br />\ncurrent show, And Things That<br />\nGo Bump in the Night is a<br />\nrepeat of the first production<br />\nthey ever did. Some revisions<br />\nwere done, but there were no<br />\nchanges in emphasis. \"It was<br />\nvery successful a decade ago,\"<br />\nTyler says, \"otherwise, we<br />\ncould not have continued.\"<br />\nActors, directors and assistants are all non-equity volunteers. They have a core repertory company, but they hold<br />\nopen auditions for all plays.<br />\nCurrently, they are most in<br />\nneed of technical people and<br />\npublicity people. Part of the<br />\nFPT's purpose is to teach. The<br />\ntheatre has an informal cooperation with the Vagabond<br />\nPlayers for sets and publicity.<br />\nThe two complement each<br />\nother well because the Vagabond is more staid, while the<br />\nFPT leans toward experimental<br />\ntheater.<br />\nThis summer the FPT and<br />\ncont. on p.<br />\n<br />\n\f14/SEPTEMBER 23. 1983<br />\n<br />\nArts Calendar<br />\nTHEATRE<br />\nI Do!

This character is the funniest in the play and the most<br />\nessential. Although he is included in nearly every scene, when<br />\nhe is not present the play seems<br />\nto drag. The other performers<br />\nplay off of him well. Mikey's<br />\nexpressions and constant running to the bathroom or<br />\nswallowing of bella-donna pills<br />\nevoke precise and hilarious<br />\nreactions from the other<br />\ncharacters.<br />\nBesides lack of Mikey the<br />\nplay also loses rhythm and<br />\nslows down in spots where the<br />\nbasic plot is forgotten. It seems<br />\nDenker uses the play as a vehicle to bring other politically<br />\nrelevant issues to the audience,<br />\nin addition to: \"Why can't the<br />\nol' folks shack up like the<br />\nyoung ones do?\" Even though<br />\nthese breaks from the plot are<br />\nhumorous and are performed<br />\nwithin the limits of the<br />\ncharacters, they are distracting.<br />\nThe play deals with the sexual<br />\nrevolution; Mikey and Eleanor<br />\nair their dirty laundry in front<br />\nof their parents, arguing over<br />\nMikey's sexual overwork and<br />\nthe bad back it's caused him.<br />\n\"That was no trip to Ber-<br />\n<br />\nNEWS-LETTER/15<br />\nmuda,\" he complains to his<br />\nmother, \"but Chicago.\" The<br />\nwindy city is, of course, where<br />\nMaster's and Johnson's is<br />\nlocated.<br />\nSecond Time Around, which<br />\nwill play every Friday through<br />\nSunday until October 9th,<br />\nalthough funny and engrossing,<br />\nwould be more appreciated by<br />\nan older audience.

But the defense stiffened as Kevin McKeown came<br />\nup with a big hit, knocking<br />\nSwarthmore fullback Ed<br />\nMeehan for a one yard loss,<br />\nforcing a punt.<br />\nThe Jays went nowhere on<br />\noffense though, losing seven<br />\nyards on three plays. Punter<br />\nBob Cardwell, kicing from his<br />\nown end zone, got off a low line<br />\ndrive that was returned 30 yards<br />\nby Kurt Goering to the Hopkins<br />\nnine.<br />\nTwo plays later fullback Pete<br />\nSelverian went up the middle<br />\nfor six yards and a touchdown.<br />\nThe extra-point was good, giving Swarthmore a 7-0 lead.<br />\nThe Jays first scoring opportunity came when a pass from<br />\nSwarthmore quarterback Mike<br />\nReil was deflected by defensive<br />\nlineman Seth Baker and picked<br />\noff by middle linebacker John<br />\nByrd.<br />\nHopkins took possession on<br />\nthe Swarthmore 22. Quarterback Mark Campbell hit tight<br />\nend John Tucker over the middle for a 14 yard pick up on<br />\nfirst down. After a Brad<br />\nMcLam carry picked up four<br />\nyards, Campbell was picked off<br />\nin the end zone, ending the<br />\nHopkins threat.<br />\n<br />\nSwarthmore struck back<br />\nquickly as Reil hooked up with<br />\nhalfback Ed Meehan for a 79<br />\nyard gain. Three plays later<br />\nSwarthmore scored again on a<br />\ntwo yard sweep by halfback<br />\nPete Coveleski. The conversion<br />\nwas good, making score 14-0.<br />\nThe Hopkins offense could<br />\nnot get on track and was forced<br />\n<br />\nHopkins went to a spread<br />\nformation sending half back<br />\nTony Nutter out as a split end,<br />\nputting wingback Dickie<br />\nStromberg in the slot, and leaving McLam as the only running<br />\nback. This proved very successful as Hopkins would flood<br />\nthe zone with McLam swinging<br />\nout of the backfield for gains of<br />\n<br />\nTony Nutter gained live yards Saturday.<br />\n<br />\ned to punt after an incomplete<br />\npass on a third and one situation.<br />\nBill Broscidus returned the<br />\nHopkins punt 17 yards, giving<br />\nSwarthmore excellent field<br />\nposition once again. Blue Jay<br />\nsafety Jim Pellicane intercepted<br />\nan underthrown Mike Reil pass<br />\nat the Hopkins five yard line<br />\nreturning it to the 14.<br />\nThe Hopkins offense finally<br />\ncame to life. Campbell hit wide<br />\nreceiver Ken Loeber for a six<br />\nyard pick-up, and then hit<br />\nfullback McLam on a swing<br />\npass for another six yards and<br />\na first down.<br />\n<br />\ntwelve and five yards, sandwiching a twelve yard reception<br />\nby Stromberg.<br />\nAfter an incompletion and a<br />\npass to McLam for no gain,<br />\nquarterback Campbell was<br />\nagain intercepted in the end<br />\nzone.<br />\nTrailing 14-0 at the half the<br />\nJays came out throwing.

It was<br />\nhard to choose just one of the<br />\nmany items from my Exciting<br />\nthings to do in Baltimore on a<br />\nSunday afternoon list, but I<br />\nfinally decided to go to the<br />\nOrioles game with some<br />\nfriends.<br />\n1:30 p.m. We arrive at<br />\nMemorial Stadium and go directly to Gate E-6 to buy our<br />\nspecial discounted student<br />\ntickets.

The team<br />\nplayed well, exhibiting strength,<br />\nas well as team work, throughout the first half.<br />\nDuring the second half,<br />\nthough, Hopkins lost some of<br />\nits control as Widener played<br />\nstrongly, firing at the Jays with<br />\nmany cross-field shots.<br />\nThe Blue Jays held on to<br />\ntheir lead as goalie Wendy<br />\nAtkinson and sweeper Roleyn<br />\nLandry excelled on defense.<br />\nYet, the team's play was not on<br />\nthe same level as it was in the<br />\nfirst half.<br />\nWidener was a strong opening oppoent and Coach Anderson was pleased with the win.<br />\n\"Widener was a good team to<br />\nbeat.

For no reason at all.<br />\nOriginally, Council President Maureen<br />\nFreed proposed that a new secretarial desk,<br />\n10 stacking chairs, two executive desk chairs,<br />\nand a small conference table should be purchased for $1000. And the reason for buying the 14 pieces of furniture would be to<br />\nmake the office functional. Again.<br />\nLast year's Council, however, never complained that their office wasn't functional.<br />\nAnd thus never requested new furniture.<br />\nSo. what were Freed's reasons for the proposed $1000 expenditure?<br />\nThe secretarial desk is too small; it only<br />\nhas enough room for a typewriter. The present executive desk chair is broken. There<br />\naren't enough chairs. And there isn't a small<br />\nconference table in the office, only a long<br />\ntable where the stencil machine and the<br />\nGestetner rest.<br />\nSecretarial work, especially Council secretarial work, doesn't necessarily have to be<br />\ndone at the secretarial desk.<br />\nThe executive desk chair can be repaired.<br /><br />\nNo more stacking chairs are needed on<br />\ncampus.<br />\nAnd a conference table just isn't necessary. Last year, a conference room was added to the SAC office to provide student<br />\ngroups and Council committees with a functional meeting area.<br />\nAt the meeting, Freed said there was an<br />\nadvantage to buying the equipment. \"They<br />\nwill deliver it within 72 hours. Let's do it<br />\nonce and do it right.\"<br />\nAfter four votes(one for each type of furniture), the Council decided upon the secretarial desk and the two executive chairs,<br />\nwhich could have been purchased at an auction or a government surplus if Freed didn't<br />\nwant the furniture immediately.<br />\nCouncil will now have to defend their $470<br />\npurchase, which may annoy several SAC<br />\ngroups whose budgets were decreased this<br />\nyear due to an overall cut in the SAC budget.<br />\nMoreover, arguments concerning the 14<br />\npieces of furniture wasted most of Wednesday night's Council meeting, which could've<br />\nbeen better spent discussing Spring Fair. . .<br /><br />\nAnd Spring Fair<br /><br />\nFurthermore, the line which<br />\nthe quiz-\"master\" wrote for<br />\nLove, American Style was incorrect.

The<br />\npositions available include<br />\naquarist, in which the intern is<br />\ninvolved in the care of aquatic<br />\nspecimens, horticulture, in<br />\nwhich the intern assists in the<br />\ncare of planted areas, aviculture, in which the animals in the<br />\nrain_ forest exhibit are cared<br />\nfor; public relations; marine<br />\neducation; and graphics design.<br />\nWhile the internship program<br />\noffers no pay, the student can<br />\nobtain college credit for it.<br />\nThe Education Department<br />\nalso coordinates the training<br />\nand evaluation of the 400<br />\nvolunteers in husbandry, administration, marketing, and<br />\nother areas. The volunteer program originally started by the<br />\nJunior League of Baltimore,<br />\nconsists of people, all of whom<br />\nare age 18 or older, who teach<br />\nand assist visitors, prepare<br />\nfood, prune plants, sell gift<br />\nitems in the aqrarium shop,<br />\nand help in various offices<br />\nThese volunteers have contributed over 45,000 hours to<br />\nthe aquarium and they greatly<br />\nadd to its smooth performance.<br />\nWith all these education programs, the National Aquarium<br />\ndoes indeed generate a \"quality experience\" for all those who<br />\nare part of its activities.<br /><br />\nAquadopt Program<br /><br />\nAnimal Care<br /><br />\nAnother area in which the<br />\nNational Aquarium receives<br />\nsupport from the public is the<br />\nAquadopt program. By making<br />\na tax deductable contribution to<br />\nthe Aquadopt program (for as<br />\nlittle as $15), you can adopt the<br />\nfish, mammal, bird or plant of<br />\nyour choice for one year, and<br />\nthereby help provide for its care<br />\nand feeding. In recognition ot<br />\nyour donation the aquarium<br />\nwill send the \"adoptee\" a personalized adoption certificate<br />\nand a bumper sticker.<br /><br />\nThe chief veterinarian of' the<br />\naquarium, Dr. Michael<br />\nStoskopf, handles the tasks of<br />\npreventive medicine and clinical<br />\ncare for the aquarium's<br />\nanimals. Dr. Stoskopf, who is<br />\nalso an assistant professor of<br />\ncomparative medicine at the<br />\nKennedy Institute of the Johns<br />\nHopkins School of Medecine,<br />\nhas participated and is participating in several major<br />\nresearch projects at the<br />\naquarium. Among these are<br />\nstudies that seek to find out the<br />\neffeetc of antibiotics on sharks<br />\nand invertebrates, the effects of<br />\nthe stress of captivity on<br />\nphysiology and disease in<br />\ndolphins and fish, the interrelations and interactions of the<br />\npublic and the animals at the<br />\naquarium, and the anatomy of<br />\npelicans and sharks.<br />\nWith all of these projects and<br />\nprograms that are centered<br />\naround the aquarium, many<br />\npeople at the National Aquarium<br />\nexpressed the idea that the<br />\naquarium has grown quickly<br />\nand grown to be strong. As Dr.<br />\nStoskopf indicated, \"Even<br />\nthough it is only two years old<br />\nit is a leader in science and<br />\nmarine research . . .contributing<br />\nvery heavily to the field.\" People at the aquarium also conveyed a sense of never being<br />\nsatisfied with the accomplished,<br />\nof being eager to achieve more<br />\nand likewise, of being very incited about the maturing of the<br />\naquarium.<br /><br />\nDiana Spencer, the director<br />\nof the Aquadopt program explained that a program to support the aquarium's animal<br />\npopulation existed before the<br />\naquarium even opened, in<br />\nAugust 1981. In November<br />\n1982 the present Aquadopt program for animals was started.<br />\nThis rekindling of the idea for<br />\nthe public's support was marked by a special event where<br />\nSugar Ray Leonard \"adopted\"<br />\na Southern Sting Ray from the<br />\nOpen Ocean Tank. As the last<br />\nfiscal year the aquarium had<br />\nover 900 people support this<br />\nprogram and there are as Diana<br />\nSpencer said,\"proud parents in<br />\n44 States.\" People very often<br />\nchoose animals that may 'send<br />\na message' to the person for<br />\nwhom they are adopted. Such<br />\nis the case when people<br />\n\"adopt\" grunts (Blue Stripe,<br />\nCaesar's, Cottonwick, French,<br />\nSmall Mouth, or White) for<br />\nFather's Day. Diana Spencer<br />\nnoted that the Aquadopt program owes part of its success to<br />\npeople who \"adopt\" animals<br />\nand plants for people they<br />\nknow in other states and even<br />\nother countries. The Aquadopt<br />\nprogram was, until this last<br />\nspring, limited to just the<br />\n\"adoption\" of animals. The<br />\n\"adoption\" program that now<br />\nincludes plants, has some of its<br />\nstrongest support from people<br />\nwho frequently visit the<br />\naquarium.<br /><br />\nPlants and...<br />\nThe work of Stephen Amos,<br />\nthe<br />\naquarium's<br />\nsenior<br />\naviculturist includes aspects of<br />\nthe operation of the rain forest<br />\nand the maintenance of the puffin exhibit.

According to Dr.<br />\nLennox Cowie, the liason between the Space Telescope Institute and Johns Hopkins, the<br />\nfive instruments that will be<br />\naboard the telescope are being<br />\nbuilt at The California Institute<br />\nof Technology, Goddard Space<br />\nFlight Center, The University<br />\nof San Diego, the European<br />\nSpace Agency, and the University of Wisconsin. All the instruments are to be tested at<br />\nGoddard.<br />\nPhysics professor Arthur<br />\nDavidsen was responsible for<br />\nbringing the Space Telescope to<br />\nHopkins. A number of proposals for the institute were received by NASA. Dr. Davidsen's proposal was the one accepted. The other final proposal was to build the Space Telescope Institute at Princeton<br />\nUniversity. But, according to<br />\nCowie, there has not been much<br />\ninvolvement of any universities,<br />\nnot even Hopkins. However, in<br />\n.the coming years there will be<br />\nmore contact between The<br />\nSpace Telescope Institute and<br />\nJohns Hopkins.<br />\nBy January of 1984, two people from The Space Telescope<br />\nInstitute are to become full professors in the Physics department with 50% appointments.<br />\nOne of these people is Dr.<br />\nCowie, who presently holds the<br />\nstatus of visiting scientist. One<br />\nof the primary reasons for the<br />\njoint appointments will be to<br />\nteach graduate courses. Students will be involved to a great<br />\ndegree. The staff members of<br />\nthe institute have their individual research, and there is<br />\ntherefore, as Dr. Cowie says,<br />\n\"a crying need for students.\"<br />\nStudents will do research, even<br />\ntheses relating to the Space<br />\nTelescope. All of this will start<br />\nup slowly, but will gradually increase. In the future, the staff<br />\nat the institute will even help<br />\nteach undergraduate astronomy<br />\ncourses.<br />\nThe Physics department will<br />\ngreatly expand in the area of<br />\nastrophysics. The institute will<br />\nemploy more than one hundred<br />\npeople, thirty of whom will be<br />\nscientific staff. (That's a very<br />\nlarge number of astrophysicists<br />\nto be in one place.) Although<br />\nHopkins only holds the status<br />\nof \"guest observer institution,\"<br />\nDr. Cowie feels that it is inevitable that JHU will become<br />\na leader in astrophysics; it is<br /><br />\n\"almost a truism.\" Hopkins had,<br />\nbeen a leader in the field of<br />\nPhysics in the 1920's, and JHU<br />\nwill assuredly be a leader once<br />\nagain, but this time the Physics<br />\ndepartment will probably hold<br />\non to such a reputation for a<br />\nmuch greater period of time.<br />\nCowie said that in thirty to<br />\nforty years from now, there will<br />\nbe a \"substantial probability\"<br />\nthat Hopkins will be a leader in<br />\nPhysics.<br />\nThe astrophysicists already in<br />\nthe Physics department who are<br />\nnot part of the institute do not<br />\nhave a favored status.

Clark<br />\nAlthough the impressive and<br />\ncostly renovation of the freshman dorms here at Hopkins<br />\nhave attracted quite a bit of attention, they have not overshadowed the cosmetic improvements that have excited<br />\nthose that frequent, and have<br />\nsparked the interest of others<br />\nin, the Grad Club.<br />\nIt all started in 1964; a plan<br />\nto create a student center at the<br />\nsocially barren and Rathskeller-less Hopkins Campus, primarily for Graduate students.<br />\n,<br />\nThe space in the basement of<br />\nthe recently purchased apartment building, McCoy, was<br />\nsuggested. It was one room and<br />\na kitchen, dry but comfortable<br />\n(it would be two years until the<br />\nClub would receive its license to<br />\nserve liquor). With money<br />\ngained from profits and provided by the University, the Grad<br />\nClub would expand to its present three rooms. Painfully informal; the place for many to<br />\ngo when desperate: the \"Sad<br />\nClub\". Although it never really lacked in its ability to support<br />\nitself, the Grad Club was not<br />\nfrequented by a number of students because of its unattractiveness. Until, prompted by<br />\nthe slow business of the summer months, new managers,<br />\nLarry Klein and Jerry Macdonald decided it was about<br />\ntime the Grad Club became<br />\n\"civilized\".<br />\n\"Every Saturday night at<br />\nleast we'd come to the Grad<br />\nClub,\" remarked one student,<br />\n\"They've always had good<br />\nbeer.\"<br />\nHowever: \"Never, no I think<br />\nI was down there once freshman year,\" said another, \"I'm<br />\na senior now.\" Both students<br />\nwere interviewed at the new and<br />\ndifferent Grad Club.<br />\nThe first student has returned<br />\nto Hopkins for the fall discovering that the Club has become<br />\nmore than a place to get a good<br />\nimport for cheap; the other has<br /><br />\nfound the Grad Club no longer graduate student studying<br />\ntoo sleazy to endure.

The income<br />\nis now mostly based on the purchase of food.<br />\nAlso part of the plan for<br />\ncivilizing the Grad Club is the<br />\ngeneral improvement of the<br />\nfare.<br />\n\"We've just added kosher<br />\nhot dogs and they're going over<br />\nbig, Klein said.\"Now we'd also<br />\nlike to improve the menu in<br />\ngeneral\u2014maybe get better coffee.\" Klein and Macdonald<br />\nplan to use the microwave oven<br />\nto broaden the selection and<br />\nimprove the service of Grad<br /><br />\nox a s character t<br />\ngested that we \"Nuke the<br />\nJuke\".<br />\n\"If it's those weirdos who<br />\ncome in here to play bridge,\"<br />\nthe same student added, \"I<br />\ndon't think they'll get much<br />\nattention.\"<br />\n\"We're a non-profit business<br />\nhere,\" Klein said, \"a service to<br />\nprovide for everybody.

This Fell's<br />\nPoint Theatre production offers few clues as to what this<br />\nsomething could be, but it does<br />\noffer solace in an oft repeated<br />\nshibboleth,\"We shall prevail.\"<br />\nThis seems very reassuring, but<br />\nthe audience is left wondering,<br />\nin reality, who does prevail?<br />\nOver what are they prevailing?<br />\nThe characters did a great job<br />\nof arguing about the issues as<br />\nthe play progressed, but these<br />\nquestions are left too openended when the curtain falls.<br />\nOne gets the feeling a deep<br />\nrevelation has ocurred, yet<br />\ncomething vital was left out of<br />\nthe script, as it remains a<br />\nmystery.<br />\nThe setting is vague\u2014a basement dwelling in a politically<br />\noppressed area. The prevailing<br />\nmood is one of paranoia and<br />\nmalevolence. Ruby, bizarre<br />\nmatriarch of the bizarre family, creates this mood. She is the<br />\nflamboyant, reigning queen of<br />\nthe basement. This family<br />\nSpends its nights after the<br />\ncurfew bell has tolled in this<br />\nbarren, cell-like \"sanctuary.\"<br />\nThe characters often make dry<br />\nreferences to the electric fence<br />\nsurrounding the house that kills<br />\nabout five animals a night.<br />\nMother trounces around in<br />\nstately attire hissing vague<br />\nthreats and pessimistic credos.<br />\nShe attempts to adapt her<br />\nChildren to an exclusive cooper-<br /><br />\nation in which they shut off the<br />\noutside world consisting only of<br />\nimpure enemies.<br />\nClarence, an outsider, is<br />\nlured to the \"sanctuary\" by<br />\nRuby's son, Sigfrid. There, he<br />\nis tormented and debased to his<br />\nfinal point of desperation, during which he goes the same unl'ortunate route as the animals<br />\nlying fried in the front yard. He<br />\nwas an average and well-meaning kind of guy. In the final act,<br />\nthe supposedly weak one is destroyed, while the embittered,<br />\nself-serving survivalist unit lives<br />\nwith dignity intact.<br />\nThe disconnected plot is<br />\ncompensated for by the colorful rantings of the characters.<br />\nThey are a family of quirky,<br />\nbitter survivalists who live by<br />\nthe Darwinian principle in a<br />\nsociety run on a system of martial law. Grandfa,(Bob Eder),<br />\nfights the overall mood of,<br />\nmalevolence. He wheels in with<br />\nthe complaint, \"They hid my<br />\nteeth in a God damn cookie<br />\njar!\" He is the only likeable<br />\ncharacter. He develops his role<br />\nas the collective conscience of<br />\nthis perturbed family with a<br />\ngood mix of subtlety and<br />\nenergy.<br />\nThe portrayal of Ruby,(Darlene Kelley), has energy, but the<br />\nsubtlety was lacking. Kate,<br />\nShakespeare's shrew, is a<br />\nsweetheart compared to this<br />\nwoman. Kelley would be more<br />\neffective it' she lowered the<br />\ndecibels occasionally, but she<br />\noverpowers everyone else with<br />\nher venomous relationship with<br />\nthe audience.

The acting,<br />\noverall, is polished. The<br />\ndialogue is entertaining, but it<br />\nleads nowhere.<br />\nThe problem is the script<br />\nitself. One is left hanging; there<br />\nis no real conclusion to the<br />\ndisconnected sequence of<br />\ndialogues and the one major<br />\nevent. There is no central conflict, only a series of observations. After the show, one of<br />\nthe stage assistants commented,<br />\n\"In the first act, things are a little confused. In the second act,<br />\nthe death clears things up a little. In the third act, their reactions make things confused<br />\nagain.\" The fault lies not<br />\nwithin the production itself, but<br />\nwithin the script. All the seemingly meaningful clues were<br />\nnever strung together, thus<br />\nmaking it difficult to derive<br />\nanything cohesive or worthwhile to carry away and<br />\nremember after the show.<br /><br />\nby Tara Peattie<br /><br />\n\"One of the qualities of the<br />\nFells Point Theatre is that there<br />\ncertainly isn't a bad seat in the<br />\nplace,\" Al Tyler comments<br />\nwryly. The tiny, quaint Fells<br />\nPoint Theatre(FPT)celebrates<br />\nits tenth anniversary this<br />\nmonth, and Tyler is its faithful<br />\nmentor. He co-founded the<br />\ntheatre and currently manages<br />\nand directs its productions. He<br />\nlooks like the archetypal director. His countenance is austere<br />\nand distinguished, his eyes are<br />\nbright, his white hair and<br />\nmoustache are disordered. He<br />\nwears shabby jeans and a flannel shirt. He chain smokes and<br />\ndrinks Chocolate Royale soda,<br />\nand, in between these indulgences, he waves his arms dramatically, implementing his<br />\ndiscussion.<br />\nThe theatre itself is a rather<br />\nugly edifice squashed onto the<br />\ncorner of Broadway and Shakespeare in this picturesque PolishItalian section of Baltimore.<br />\n\"We're fortunate in that we<br />\ncan't get a better address,\"<br />\nTyler comments, but he does<br />\nhave a few complaints. For<br />\none, he would like a bigger place.<br />\nThe theatre only seats fifty people, and the backstage is almost<br />\nnonexistent. Because of the<br />\nstage limitations, they seldom<br />\nhave more than one set. Despite<br />\nthis, they have a reputation in<br />\nBaltimore community theatre<br />\nfor having had some of the<br />\nmost imaginative sets.<br />\nOver the past ten years, the<br />\nFPT has tried a bit of everything. \"We've done Neil<br />\n444000000004 Simon, Tennessee Williams,<br /><br />\nShakespeare, and lately we're<br />\nleaning toward modern, offbeat stuff.\" Tyler takes suggestions from his assistants and<br />\nmanagers, and then makes the<br />\nfinal decisions on what plays<br />\nwill be performed himself. He<br />\nobserves of his recent productions of modern plays, \"You<br />\ncan hardly get a newer play that<br />\ndoesn't deal with homosexuality.\" He is careful that the ones<br />\nthe FPT puts on are enjoyable<br />\nand relevant for anyone. P.S.,<br />\nYour Cat is Dead was a record<br />\nbreaking money maker for<br />\nthem last year. Other recent<br />\nsuccesses have been The Boys in<br />\nthe Band, Fortune in Man's<br />\nEyes, and My Fat Friend. Their<br />\ncurrent show, And Things That<br />\nGo Bump in the Night is a<br />\nrepeat of the first production<br />\nthey ever did. Some revisions<br />\nwere done, but there were no<br />\nchanges in emphasis. \"It was<br />\nvery successful a decade ago,\"<br />\nTyler says, \"otherwise, we<br />\ncould not have continued.\"<br />\nActors, directors and assistants are all non-equity volunteers. They have a core repertory company, but they hold<br />\nopen auditions for all plays.<br />\nCurrently, they are most in<br />\nneed of technical people and<br />\npublicity people. Part of the<br />\nFPT's purpose is to teach.

But the defense stiffened as Kevin McKeown came<br />\nup with a big hit, knocking<br />\nSwarthmore fullback Ed<br />\nMeehan for a one yard loss,<br />\nforcing a punt.<br />\nThe Jays went nowhere on<br />\noffense though, losing seven<br />\nyards on three plays. Punter<br />\nBob Cardwell, kicing from his<br />\nown end zone, got off a low line<br />\ndrive that was returned 30 yards<br />\nby Kurt Goering to the Hopkins<br />\nnine.<br />\nTwo plays later fullback Pete<br />\nSelverian went up the middle<br />\nfor six yards and a touchdown.<br />\nThe extra-point was good, giving Swarthmore a 7-0 lead.<br />\nThe Jays first scoring opportunity came when a pass from<br />\nSwarthmore quarterback Mike<br />\nReil was deflected by defensive<br />\nlineman Seth Baker and picked<br />\noff by middle linebacker John<br />\nByrd.<br />\nHopkins took possession on<br />\nthe Swarthmore 22. Quarterback Mark Campbell hit tight<br />\nend John Tucker over the middle for a 14 yard pick up on<br />\nfirst down. After a Brad<br />\nMcLam carry picked up four<br />\nyards, Campbell was picked off<br />\nin the end zone, ending the<br />\nHopkins threat.<br /><br />\nSwarthmore struck back<br />\nquickly as Reil hooked up with<br />\nhalfback Ed Meehan for a 79<br />\nyard gain. Three plays later<br />\nSwarthmore scored again on a<br />\ntwo yard sweep by halfback<br />\nPete Coveleski. The conversion<br />\nwas good, making score 14-0.<br />\nThe Hopkins offense could<br />\nnot get on track and was forced<br /><br />\nHopkins went to a spread<br />\nformation sending half back<br />\nTony Nutter out as a split end,<br />\nputting wingback Dickie<br />\nStromberg in the slot, and leaving McLam as the only running<br />\nback. This proved very successful as Hopkins would flood<br />\nthe zone with McLam swinging<br />\nout of the backfield for gains of<br /><br />\nTony Nutter gained live yards Saturday.<br /><br />\ned to punt after an incomplete<br />\npass on a third and one situation.<br />\nBill Broscidus returned the<br />\nHopkins punt 17 yards, giving<br />\nSwarthmore excellent field<br />\nposition once again. Blue Jay<br />\nsafety Jim Pellicane intercepted<br />\nan underthrown Mike Reil pass<br />\nat the Hopkins five yard line<br />\nreturning it to the 14.<br />\nThe Hopkins offense finally<br />\ncame to life. Campbell hit wide<br />\nreceiver Ken Loeber for a six<br />\nyard pick-up, and then hit<br />\nfullback McLam on a swing<br />\npass for another six yards and<br />\na first down.<br /><br />\ntwelve and five yards, sandwiching a twelve yard reception<br />\nby Stromberg.<br />\nAfter an incompletion and a<br />\npass to McLam for no gain,<br />\nquarterback Campbell was<br />\nagain intercepted in the end<br />\nzone.<br />\nTrailing 14-0 at the half the<br />\nJays came out throwing. On<br />\ntheir second possession after intermission, the Jays moved the<br />\nball well. Starting from their<br />\nown 39, Campbell hit Loeber<br />\non a post pattern for a 17 yard<br />\ngain. Campbell then connected<br />\nwith Stromberg who made a<br />\ndiving catch for 10 yards and<br />\nanother first down.<br /><br />\nFall Lacrosse Season Begins<br />\nby David Brengel<br />\nLacrosse is back. Fall<br />\nlacrosse, that is. The reason for<br />\nthis second season? Well, according to Coach Ciccarone, its<br />\nmain purpose is the indoctrination of freshmen and transfers<br /><br />\nAfter a one yard run and two gridders' next possession. The<br />\nincomplete passes, the Jays interception by Swarthmore's<br />\ngambled on a fourth and nine Dom Lepone was returned to<br />\nsituation. They came up short, the one foot-line and two plays<br />\nhowever, as Campbell conected later Brian Koseelansky bangwith Tucker for only a five yard ed it over, upping the score to<br />\npick up. Thus Hopkins turned 21-7.<br />\nthe ball over on downs.<br />\nThe Jays were doomed as<br />\nThe Hopkins defense came Swarthmore marched 64 yards<br />\nup with a big play as linebacker for an insurance touchdown<br />\neating up much of the clock in<br />\nthe process.<br />\nThere were some encouraging signs for the team however.<br />\nThe defense played well, considering two of Swarthmore<br />\nscoring drives were less than 10<br />\nyards. The defense also forced<br />\nthree turnovers.<br />\nThe running game looked<br />\nanemic, netting only 38 yards,<br />\nthe longest an 11 yard run by<br />\nMcLam. After Hopkins fell<br />\nbehind 14-0 the running game<br />\nwas abandoned and, aside from<br />\nthc interceptiong (four overall),<br />\nthe passing game moved the<br />\nball successfully for the final<br />\nthree quarters.<br /><br />\nbetween they work on the<br />\nbasics\u2014clears, stickwork,<br />\ngroundballs, and shooting.<br />\nThere are also half and fullfield team scrimmages.<br />\nWhile most students have<br />\nbeen suffering from the intense<br />\nheat lately, Coach Ciccarone<br /><br />\nEngelke, midfielder Bruce<br />\nChanenchuck, and goalie Stuart<br />\nJones.<br />\nWhile it is too early for<br />\nCoach Ciccarone to foresee the<br />\nemergence of any freshman as<br />\na first-stringer, with the loss of<br />\nfive starters to graduation, it is<br /><br />\nDave Simon<br /><br />\nJohn Dorsey recovered a Pete STATISTICS:<br />\nCoveleski fumble at the Swar- Rushing JHU: McLam 12-38,<br />\nthmore 42.

It was<br />\nhard to choose just one of the<br />\nmany items from my Exciting<br />\nthings to do in Baltimore on a<br />\nSunday afternoon list, but I<br />\nfinally decided to go to the<br />\nOrioles game with some<br />\nfriends.<br />\n1:30 p.m. We arrive at<br />\nMemorial Stadium and go directly to Gate E-6 to buy our<br />\nspecial discounted student<br />\ntickets. It's a real good bargain\u2014on all but 10 of the 81<br />\nhome games students can purchase a $5.50 upper reserved<br />\nseat for $3.50.<br />\nOf course, since this was the<br />\ngame I decided to attend, it was<br />\none of those 10 contests without discounted tickets for students. So, I pay $4.25 for a<br />\nlousy general admission ticket.<br />\n1:45 p.m. As we find seats in<br />\nSection 34, I observe stadium<br />\nushers carrying around cans of<br />\nbee repellent.

BRUCE HYATT<br />\nOPTOMETRIST<br />\n200 W. COLDSPRING LANE<br />\nNear N. Charles St., Across from Alonzo's<br /><br />\nBy beating Widener, 1-0, this<br />\npast Saturday, the Hopkins<br />\nField Hockey team opened their<br />\nseason with determination and<br />\nstrength.<br />\nDuring the first half, forward<br />\nJudy Schmidt scored the only<br />\ngoal of the game. Her shot<br />\ncame off an assist by Monique<br />\nMuri, as the play was set up by<br />\nJennifer O'Connor. The team<br />\nplayed well, exhibiting strength,<br />\nas well as team work, throughout the first half.<br />\nDuring the second half,<br />\nthough, Hopkins lost some of<br />\nits control as Widener played<br />\nstrongly, firing at the Jays with<br />\nmany cross-field shots.<br />\nThe Blue Jays held on to<br />\ntheir lead as goalie Wendy<br />\nAtkinson and sweeper Roleyn<br />\nLandry excelled on defense.<br />\nYet, the team's play was not on<br />\nthe same level as it was in the<br />\nfirst half.<br />\nWidener was a strong opening oppoent and Coach Anderson was pleased with the win.<br />\n\"Widener was a good team to<br />\nbeat. It has a strong reputation<br />\nin the Philadelphia area and<br />\nthat certainly reflects well on<br />\nus,\" she said.<br />\nAnd, the team is still in a<br />\ntransitional period since the<br />\nstarting varsity does not remain<br />\nconstant. At this point, Anderson is maintaining an eighteen<br />\nplayer varsity squad, most of<br />\nwhom see playing time each<br />\ngame.<br />\nBecause the team will be losing seven strong seniors, she<br />\nwants to break the freshmen in<br />\nas soon as possible in order for<br />\nthem to gain some experience.<br />\nThe line-up, then, is always<br />\nfluctuating.<br />\nStill, the forward line is<br />\nshaped mainly by five players<br />\nwho exhibit both speed and aggressiveness. Two freshmen,<br />\nSusan Bessin and Carol Butterworth, add energy to the group<br />\nwith quick action and determined play in the circle. Anderson also added that they de-<br /><br />\nmonstrate enthusiasm and great<br />\npotential.<br /><br />\nSophomore Judy Schmidt is<br />\nthe \"spark on the forward<br />\nline; she makes things happen.<br />\nSpeed, aggression, as well as<br />\nskill, distinguish veteran seniors<br />\nSharon Horvath and Monique<br />\nMuri. Anderson also termed<br />\nMuri as \"a play-maker\" who<br />\ncreates opportune situations.<br /><br />\nHopkins and Widener fight it out.<br /><br />\nDefensively, the unit is led by<br />\nCo-Captains Martha Gottling<br />\nand Wendy Atkinson. Consistently demonstrating agility and<br />\nskill in the goal, Atkinson is a<br />\nveteran player who has been<br />\nnamed to the Baltimore College<br />\nteam for the past three years.<br />\nSimilarly, Gottling has also<br />\nbeen named to this team since<br />\nher freshman year, especially<br />\nsince she is always playing at<br />\nher top level of energy and skill.<br />\nGottling receives help at midfield from senior Jennifer<br />\nO'Connor who is strong, and<br />\nwho, with Gottling, dominates<br />\nthe midfield. Returning after a<br />\nyear's absence, senior Liz<br />\nEvans is also a strong contender<br /><br />\n)41111.4)111104)411111114)41\u2022111N)11M1.0.41110.0<br /><br />\n04E0.0<br /><br />\n4111MN)<br /><br />\nPARTY<br />\nUNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO<br />\nGRADUATE SCHOOL OF BUSINESS<br /><br />\nM.B.A.<br />\nStudents of All Majors and Fields Invited<br />\nCome to our meetings to hear about our M.B.A. and<br />\nPh.D. Programs and to ask any questions about the<br />\ncurriculum, admission, financial aid, and career opportunities available in the following fields of management:<br />\nHealth Administration<br />\nFinance<br />\nPublic and NonProfit<br />\nEconomics<br />\nHuman Resources<br />\nMarketing<br />\nManagement Science<br />\nAccounting<br />\nPolicy<br />\nGeneral Management<br /><br />\nMonday, October 3, 1983<br />\nContact Placement Bureau for Sign-Ups<br /><br />\nsince she is well-skilled and<br />\nhelps the stability of the defense.

With the<br />\nstrength and capable skill of<br />\nRoleyn Landry at sweep, the<br />\nback-line portrays solidity and<br />\ndetermination.<br />\nOverall, both Anderson and<br />\nher players are excited about<br />\nthis year's team. \"As long as<br />\nwe maintain conditioning,\"<br />\nAnderson said, \"We'll retain<br />\nour high level of skill. But<br />\nperhaps more importantly, the<br />\nteam has a great time playing,<br />\nwhich certainly adds to the<br />\nladies wanting to be the best<br />\nthey can.\"<br />\nThese players themselves<br />\nregard their team with even<br />\nmore enthusiasm and pride.<br />\nSenior Sharon Horvath added,\"We have depth and we're<br />\ngood.
