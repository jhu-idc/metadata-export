That section of the State<br />\nhas too long been looked upon by Baltimoreans as being too inaccessible. As a matter of fact, it is within close proximity of this<br />\ncity, the trip being a matter of only a few hours.<br />\nAs the Barnstormers prepare for their new dramatic season<br />\nthey would do well to consider the possibility of presenting their<br />\nplay at seireral Eastern Shore towns during the Easter holidays.<br />\nIt has long seemed the height of folly for the Barnstormers, after<br />\na long period of rehearsing the manuscript and painting the scenery, to give only two public performances. By. the time the actors<br />\nhave become accustomed to playing their roles before an audience<br />\nthe play's brief engagement is over.<br />\nMembers of the club might object to this suggestion on the<br />\ngrounds of excessive freight charges for transporting stage properties. Such expenditures could easily be eliminated by borrowing<br />\nthe necessary furniture from merchants in the towns where the<br />\nclub performs.<br />\nPeople on the Eastern Shore would gladly welcome such an<br />\nenterprise. It is a well-known fact that the traveling dramatic<br />\nroad shows have long ago dropped small towns from their itineraries. Amusement seekers in such drama-starved districts must,<br />\ntherefore, live on the scanty diet provided by Adolphe Menjou,<br />\nClara Bow and other motion-picture mimes.<br />\nThe arrival of a good play, capably acted by the Barnstormers,<br />\nwould create a considerable stir in such towns and should prove<br />\nquite profitable at the box office.<br />\n<br />\nDR. GILMAN'S OLD PLEA<br />\nThere is no more striking note in the publications of the writers<br />\non higher education in this country than that of inadequacy. Despite differences of opinions as pp how the problem is to be met,<br />\nthe spirit that there is something definitely lacking is, nevertheless,<br />\nunanimous.<br />\nTypical of articles of this type is one by R. L. Duffus, entitled<br />\n\"A View of the College of Tomorrow,\" which appeared in last<br />\nSunday's New York Times. Mr. Duffus believes that one of the<br />\nchief weaknesses in American colleges today is the poor quality<br />\nof most of the faculties, caused by the insufficiency of endowments. He stresses the point that, except in the extremely rare<br />\ncase of the man who is willing to join the teaching profession<br />\nthrough pure love of his work, the best scholars and most inspiring<br />\nteachers are often lost, because these men are not willing to raise<br />\nfamilies on the average salary that most colleges can pay. Nor<br />\ndoes he believe that money alone will be the solution. \"Dull instructors beget dull instructors, pedagogically speaking,\" he says.<br />\nThere is a great deal to be said in favor of this argument. Inspiring teachers\u2014although not necessarily brilliant scholars\u2014can<br />\noften outweigh the evil effects of an inadequate or antiquated system. Although it seems to be becoming more and more patent<br />\nevery day that the American college must undergo changes in order<br />\nto fulfill its mission, it should also be recognized that no matter<br />\nhow many modifications are made in curricula, these changes<br />\nshould be accompanied by the attraction to the colleges of men<br />\nwho cannot only teach youth, but inspire him.<br />\n<br />\nTHE LITTLE THEATRE<br />\n<br />\nINTERCOLLEGIATE NEWS<br />\n<br />\nThe Johns Hopkins News-Letter<br />\n<br />\n*<br />\n<br />\n*<br />\n<br />\n*<br />\n<br />\n*<br />\n<br />\n*<br />\n<br />\nAn alumnus of the University of<br />\nChicago and the president of a large<br />\nnational concern in that city stated<br />\nin a recent address that a college<br />\neducation is worth $72,000. He<br />\nfurthermore said that this represents a profit of'1,200 per cent. on<br />\nan original investment of $6,000,<br />\nwhich is the average total cost of a<br />\nfour-year course in college. Deducting the cost of the education<br />\nitself, the student adds to his future<br />\nincome at the rate of $15,000 a year<br />\nduring the time he is in college. As<br />\nclasses are held only five days a<br />\nweek, this means potential earnings<br />\nof $70.00 a day to the student for<br />\neach day spent in the classroom.

Many of the recent graduates now living in New York, but<br />\nscarecely ever having seen one another, met with much happiness at<br />\nthe football game. A desire to have<br />\na get-together dinner was enthusiastically expressed. Accordingly, a<br />\nself-appointed committee of four<br />\nmet quite frequently for two months<br />\nto discuss the situation. They were:<br />\nVernon E. Stuart, '20: Robert E.<br />\nHeyn, '26; W. Nelson Young, '26'<br />\nand J. Albert Abraham, '27.<br />\n26 Grads Present<br />\n<br />\nIn view of the fact that there is<br />\na New York-New Jersey Alumni<br />\nAssociation in existence, negotiations were immediately carried on<br />\nby the above committee to secure cooperation in obtaining the approval<br />\nand recognition of the Association's<br />\nofficers with regard to the proposed<br />\ndinner. Personal announcements<br />\nwere sent out by the committee to<br />\nthirty men who were known to be<br />\ninterested in such a dinner. Twenty-six immediately replied with their<br />\nacceptance. Among those present<br />\nwere Dr. Charles Thach, former<br />\nProfessor of History and Honorary<br />\nPresident of Class of 1925; Mr. Edgar S. Bamberger, '03. of Newark,<br />\nN. J., prominent department store<br />\nexecutive and officially representing<br />\nthe New York-New Jersey Alumni<br />\nAssociation, of which he was for<br />\nseveral years its dependable secretary, and Mr. Charming E.

And,<br />\nconversely, why does a cat remain<br />\nfixed under the same class of stimuli? Dr. Harne explained that these<br />\ntwo antithetical operations were<br />\nmotivated by not an essentially differently constructed mental organism, but by the presence of the adrenal gland. The dual construction of<br />\nthis very small but immensely important gland consists of a cortex,<br />\nor outside, and a medulla, or nucleons. A large cortex is found in<br />\ntimid animals such as the rabbit, the<br />\nmedulla being correspondingly small.<br />\nIn the case of the cat the direct antithesis occurs; namely, the cortex is<br />\nsmall and the medulla large.<br />\n<br />\nJONES CHEVROLET SALES CO.<br />\n<br />\nThe Summit<br />\nSILVER SLIPPER<br />\n<br />\nFRANK B.

That section of the State<br />\nhas too long been looked upon by Baltimoreans as being too inaccessible. As a matter of fact, it is within close proximity of this<br />\ncity, the trip being a matter of only a few hours.<br />\nAs the Barnstormers prepare for their new dramatic season<br />\nthey would do well to consider the possibility of presenting their<br />\nplay at seireral Eastern Shore towns during the Easter holidays.<br />\nIt has long seemed the height of folly for the Barnstormers, after<br />\na long period of rehearsing the manuscript and painting the scenery, to give only two public performances. By. the time the actors<br />\nhave become accustomed to playing their roles before an audience<br />\nthe play's brief engagement is over.<br />\nMembers of the club might object to this suggestion on the<br />\ngrounds of excessive freight charges for transporting stage properties. Such expenditures could easily be eliminated by borrowing<br />\nthe necessary furniture from merchants in the towns where the<br />\nclub performs.<br />\nPeople on the Eastern Shore would gladly welcome such an<br />\nenterprise. It is a well-known fact that the traveling dramatic<br />\nroad shows have long ago dropped small towns from their itineraries. Amusement seekers in such drama-starved districts must,<br />\ntherefore, live on the scanty diet provided by Adolphe Menjou,<br />\nClara Bow and other motion-picture mimes.<br />\nThe arrival of a good play, capably acted by the Barnstormers,<br />\nwould create a considerable stir in such towns and should prove<br />\nquite profitable at the box office.<br /><br />\nDR. GILMAN'S OLD PLEA<br />\nThere is no more striking note in the publications of the writers<br />\non higher education in this country than that of inadequacy. Despite differences of opinions as pp how the problem is to be met,<br />\nthe spirit that there is something definitely lacking is, nevertheless,<br />\nunanimous.<br />\nTypical of articles of this type is one by R. L. Duffus, entitled<br />\n\"A View of the College of Tomorrow,\" which appeared in last<br />\nSunday's New York Times. Mr. Duffus believes that one of the<br />\nchief weaknesses in American colleges today is the poor quality<br />\nof most of the faculties, caused by the insufficiency of endowments. He stresses the point that, except in the extremely rare<br />\ncase of the man who is willing to join the teaching profession<br />\nthrough pure love of his work, the best scholars and most inspiring<br />\nteachers are often lost, because these men are not willing to raise<br />\nfamilies on the average salary that most colleges can pay. Nor<br />\ndoes he believe that money alone will be the solution. \"Dull instructors beget dull instructors, pedagogically speaking,\" he says.<br />\nThere is a great deal to be said in favor of this argument. Inspiring teachers\u2014although not necessarily brilliant scholars\u2014can<br />\noften outweigh the evil effects of an inadequate or antiquated system. Although it seems to be becoming more and more patent<br />\nevery day that the American college must undergo changes in order<br />\nto fulfill its mission, it should also be recognized that no matter<br />\nhow many modifications are made in curricula, these changes<br />\nshould be accompanied by the attraction to the colleges of men<br />\nwho cannot only teach youth, but inspire him.<br /><br />\nTHE LITTLE THEATRE<br /><br />\nINTERCOLLEGIATE NEWS<br /><br />\nThe Johns Hopkins News-Letter<br /><br />\n*<br /><br />\n*<br /><br />\n*<br /><br />\n*<br /><br />\n*<br /><br />\nAn alumnus of the University of<br />\nChicago and the president of a large<br />\nnational concern in that city stated<br />\nin a recent address that a college<br />\neducation is worth $72,000. He<br />\nfurthermore said that this represents a profit of'1,200 per cent. on<br />\nan original investment of $6,000,<br />\nwhich is the average total cost of a<br />\nfour-year course in college.

Many of the recent graduates now living in New York, but<br />\nscarecely ever having seen one another, met with much happiness at<br />\nthe football game. A desire to have<br />\na get-together dinner was enthusiastically expressed. Accordingly, a<br />\nself-appointed committee of four<br />\nmet quite frequently for two months<br />\nto discuss the situation. They were:<br />\nVernon E. Stuart, '20: Robert E.<br />\nHeyn, '26; W. Nelson Young, '26'<br />\nand J. Albert Abraham, '27.<br />\n26 Grads Present<br /><br />\nIn view of the fact that there is<br />\na New York-New Jersey Alumni<br />\nAssociation in existence, negotiations were immediately carried on<br />\nby the above committee to secure cooperation in obtaining the approval<br />\nand recognition of the Association's<br />\nofficers with regard to the proposed<br />\ndinner. Personal announcements<br />\nwere sent out by the committee to<br />\nthirty men who were known to be<br />\ninterested in such a dinner. Twenty-six immediately replied with their<br />\nacceptance. Among those present<br />\nwere Dr. Charles Thach, former<br />\nProfessor of History and Honorary<br />\nPresident of Class of 1925; Mr. Edgar S. Bamberger, '03. of Newark,<br />\nN. J., prominent department store<br />\nexecutive and officially representing<br />\nthe New York-New Jersey Alumni<br />\nAssociation, of which he was for<br />\nseveral years its dependable secretary, and Mr. Charming E.

In<br />\nthis manner, all arrangements were<br />\nmade without sending forth any public announcements, etc. There is indeed an object in this movement\u2014<br />\none of major interest to the Johns<br />\nHopkins University.

Dr. Harne explained that these<br />\ntwo antithetical operations were<br />\nmotivated by not an essentially differently constructed mental organism, but by the presence of the adrenal gland. The dual construction of<br />\nthis very small but immensely important gland consists of a cortex,<br />\nor outside, and a medulla, or nucleons.
