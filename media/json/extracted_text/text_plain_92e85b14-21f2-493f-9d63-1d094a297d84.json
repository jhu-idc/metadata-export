She saw the Nazi invaders possess her land and crush the emotional and ethical values<br />\nof the people. On Saturday November 12 at ten o'clock she<br />\nvisited the campus of the Hopkins University to discuss the things<br />\nshe had seen and to reflect the spirit of post-war Europe that has<br />\ntwice in thirty years been the scene of world war. The subject<br />\nof her address was titled \"Can Hopkins Students Stop Another<br />\nWar?\" Twenty students attended the talk. It was obvious on November 2 that the Hopkins student could not elect the Presi4ent<br />\nof the United States. Approximately 70% of the students of this<br />\nUniversity supported Thomas Dewey for the Presidency; only<br />\n17% expressed preference for Harry Truman. But we are reminded and appropriately that the Hopkins Poll does not represent a cross-section of the electorate. What does the Hopkins Poll<br />\nrepresent? What do the twenty people who came to hear Mrs<br />\nFlesseman discuss \"Can Hopkins Students Stop Another War?\"<br />\nreflect about this campus?<br />\n<br />\nFax Davis<br />\n<br />\nIt's a pressing problem, all right. Right now,<br />\nhurried conferences are being held in secluded<br />\nrendezvous. Couriers, disguised as Gilman Hall<br />\njanitors\u2014and every one of them loaded to the<br />\ngills\u2014steal softly across the compound bearing<br />\nmessages from secret headquarters. The password<br />\nis given, dark glances are exchanged, and the<br />\nrevolution gets underway. Comrade X is sent out<br />\nfor the master-chart, Comrade Y is sent out for<br />\ncandidates, and Comrade Z is sent out for straitjackets.<br />\nThe drum-majorette will only be the first step.<br />\nAfter that, the master strategy calls for one\u2014<br />\nontSr one, mind you\u2014McCoy College Mata Hari to<br />\noffer her services to the Student Council. It will be<br />\nvery coy, comrades, but there's no getting around<br />\nthe fact that the dialectic of the plan admits no<br />\nslips. Every move is charted. She'll offer to help<br />\nwith the typing\u2014\"oh, just when you're real busy\"\u2014<br />\nbut ,he'll be around to garner all the secrets.<br />\nThen there'll come a slight change in the doling<br />\nout of finances from the SAC offices. Instead of<br />\nthe usual snarling tycoons in that den, you'll encounter a trim young thing who's out to get every<br />\nnickel back that was ever allotted activities. You'll<br />\ngo in for a nickel to pay off the 1949 News-Letter<br />\nbudget, and you'll come out with a knife between<br />\nyour ribs. Subtle, that's what it is.<br />\nThe final result I can foresee right now. One<br />\nfine morning you'll wake up, enter Levering for<br />\nthat draft of sulfuric acid, and instead of the lacrosse team, you'll find forty members of the<br />\ngirls' Wrestling team guarding the doors. And<br />\nthat's the time, chum, when you know the women<br />\nhave at last taken us over.<br />\n<br />\nWe are busy students. Ask the fellows sitting around the<br />\ncatt teria between classes; they will remind you that leisure<br />\nmoments are few ani far between. Corner someone at ten o'clock<br />\n14'riday ; he will explain that the' assembly program sounds interesting but he has another class at twelve and can't just sit<br />\nstill and listen for three hours. Classes, reading, preparing for<br />\nexams, keep us busy. We are here to do a job, to prepare ourselves for a place in the world. Few of us have time to talk about<br />\nEurope and have discussions about world affairs. By the time<br />\nI've personally been so upset over the possibili:We graduate we are academically stuffed men, intellectually hollow<br />\nties of the thing that I've started a counterplot.<br />\nmen.<br />\nEvery day for the past week I've been interviewing<br />\nWe are not a cross-section of the electorate and we proved it. freshmen who're willing to pit their life-blood<br />\nagainst the<br />\nWe vote as we ihink\u2014narrow, shallow, selfish votes. Two wars demands, infiltration. What the new movement<br />\nmore than anything else, is the historical<br />\nshould have alarmed us. When Wendell Wilkie told us about a perspective on the Hopkins<br />\nplan.<br />\n\"One World\" concept, he had two wars as testimony of the interAnd in doing this, I think I've found the universal<br />\ndependence of the community of nations. If we are selfish, we attitude of the Hopkins man to the problem. One<br />\nhad better look out for our selfish interests\u2014world war is not for Wilmer Turtleneck, class of '52, gave me what was<br />\nthe least intelligent, but probably the most widely<br />\nour selfish interests.<br />\nWhen Mrs Flesseman discusses post-war Europe, she discusses a continent whose every activity is a concern of ours. When<br />\nthis lady from Holland reminds us that the Europeans consider<br />\nAmerica a land of the \"Babbits and movie heros,\" she is reflecting the third alarm. Ours, as American college students, is<br />\ngrowing responsibility. We are reminded by commencement<br />\nspeakers, almost without exception, that the older generation ha<br />\na mess of things, that it's time the younger generation put tl<br />\nworld in order.<br />\nThere is more tocollege than books, Parties, and footb:<br />\ngames. Maybe the twenty students who came to hear Mrs Fle<br />\nman have discovered this elusive element. Perhaps the 17%<br />\nsupported Truman are aware of it:<br />\nIt is time we crawled out of our parents' povketbooks<br />\nlistened to the world. If not the hollow men will go out wit<br />\nbang and a wimper.<br />\n<br />\nheld opinion I've gotten so far. \"It's like this,\" he told me. \"When Dan Gilman,<br />\nBill Osler, and Tom Massey set this place up after<br />\nan evening at Ross', they didn't want no skoits<br />\nhangin' aroun'.

The dance<br />\nwas characterized by a Dogpatch atmosphere and<br />\nnothing stronger than \"Klckapoo Joy Juice.\" Saturday's Pigskin Hop has a worthy challenge from<br />\nthe freshman class.

George Wackenhut, coach of the Blue Jay team came into<br />\nthe dressing room of. his losing team and shouted,over the noise<br />\nof the celebrating Loyolans in the next room,\"You played a great<br />\ngame fellows. I'm proud of you.\" The contest had decided the<br />\nMason-Dixon championship.<br />\nAnd George had'a right to he proud of his boys. They had<br />\ncome within an ace of beating a team that was superior to them<br />\nin every department. They had lost the game in the final period<br />\nafter leading almost from the opening whistle a team that had<br />\nbeen picked to run riot over them. With a few breaks it could have<br />\nbeen a Black and Blue Championship. Certainly the soccermen<br />\nhad,every right to complain about the hand that had been dealt<br />\nthem. They controlled the ball for three-quarters of the game<br />\nonly to lose on several breaks that could have gone either way and<br />\nnone of which were of their making.<br />\nVICTORVIN DEFEAT<br />\nBut although the Jay looker room. was quiet and subdued by<br />\nthe loss it was also more than a little proud. Captain Bobby Lang,<br />\nwho had played in his last Mason-Dixon contest, shook his head<br />\nand said sadly, \"I guess it just wasn't to be. They were just too<br />\ngood,for us.\"<br />\n\"Billy\" Tulezogly sat quietly in the CDrner of the room and<br />\ncursed softly. It had kept two big Greyhounds busy all afternoon<br />\nto bottle up the tricky Jay center-forward and yet he had scored<br />\nhis team's two goals. He responded quickly to Coach Wackenhut's<br />\nroutine talk about pitching into Gettysburg next week with a<br />\ndetermined \"We'll beat 'em.\"<br />\nPerhaps Bill Kinling expressed the feeling of the squad better<br />\nthan anyone else. \"We may have lost but I had a right good time<br />\nPlaying this afternoon at that,\" he said. 'Wackenhut poked him<br />\nin the ribs and called to the rest of the squad,\"Kinling had a good<br />\ntime so I guess we satisfied the principles of physical education.\"<br />\nTHEY WANTED TO WIN<br />\nIt is not to be supposed fmm the above that the Hopkins<br />\nsoccer team was indifferent as to whether or not they won or lost.<br />\nThey fought and scrapped from the start of the game until it<br />\nended in almost total darkness. They played to with all they had<br />\nin them. George Pecorilla is the perfect example of the spirit of<br />\nthe team. He had only the slightest chance of seeing action that<br />\nafternoon but he played the entire game on the bench. He pleaded,<br />\nhe mocked, he screamed for \"jiust one More.\" And the rest of the<br />\nbench was the same way.<br />\nIt is a certainty that a Hopkins team cannot always win in<br />\nathletics.

She saw the Nazi invaders possess her land and crush the emotional and ethical values<br />\nof the people. On Saturday November 12 at ten o'clock she<br />\nvisited the campus of the Hopkins University to discuss the things<br />\nshe had seen and to reflect the spirit of post-war Europe that has<br />\ntwice in thirty years been the scene of world war. The subject<br />\nof her address was titled \"Can Hopkins Students Stop Another<br />\nWar?\" Twenty students attended the talk. It was obvious on November 2 that the Hopkins student could not elect the Presi4ent<br />\nof the United States. Approximately 70% of the students of this<br />\nUniversity supported Thomas Dewey for the Presidency; only<br />\n17% expressed preference for Harry Truman. But we are reminded and appropriately that the Hopkins Poll does not represent a cross-section of the electorate. What does the Hopkins Poll<br />\nrepresent? What do the twenty people who came to hear Mrs<br />\nFlesseman discuss \"Can Hopkins Students Stop Another War?\"<br />\nreflect about this campus?<br /><br />\nFax Davis<br /><br />\nIt's a pressing problem, all right. Right now,<br />\nhurried conferences are being held in secluded<br />\nrendezvous. Couriers, disguised as Gilman Hall<br />\njanitors\u2014and every one of them loaded to the<br />\ngills\u2014steal softly across the compound bearing<br />\nmessages from secret headquarters. The password<br />\nis given, dark glances are exchanged, and the<br />\nrevolution gets underway. Comrade X is sent out<br />\nfor the master-chart, Comrade Y is sent out for<br />\ncandidates, and Comrade Z is sent out for straitjackets.<br />\nThe drum-majorette will only be the first step.<br />\nAfter that, the master strategy calls for one\u2014<br />\nontSr one, mind you\u2014McCoy College Mata Hari to<br />\noffer her services to the Student Council. It will be<br />\nvery coy, comrades, but there's no getting around<br />\nthe fact that the dialectic of the plan admits no<br />\nslips. Every move is charted. She'll offer to help<br />\nwith the typing\u2014\"oh, just when you're real busy\"\u2014<br />\nbut ,he'll be around to garner all the secrets.<br />\nThen there'll come a slight change in the doling<br />\nout of finances from the SAC offices. Instead of<br />\nthe usual snarling tycoons in that den, you'll encounter a trim young thing who's out to get every<br />\nnickel back that was ever allotted activities. You'll<br />\ngo in for a nickel to pay off the 1949 News-Letter<br />\nbudget, and you'll come out with a knife between<br />\nyour ribs. Subtle, that's what it is.<br />\nThe final result I can foresee right now. One<br />\nfine morning you'll wake up, enter Levering for<br />\nthat draft of sulfuric acid, and instead of the lacrosse team, you'll find forty members of the<br />\ngirls' Wrestling team guarding the doors. And<br />\nthat's the time, chum, when you know the women<br />\nhave at last taken us over.<br /><br />\nWe are busy students. Ask the fellows sitting around the<br />\ncatt teria between classes; they will remind you that leisure<br />\nmoments are few ani far between. Corner someone at ten o'clock<br />\n14'riday ; he will explain that the' assembly program sounds interesting but he has another class at twelve and can't just sit<br />\nstill and listen for three hours. Classes, reading, preparing for<br />\nexams, keep us busy. We are here to do a job, to prepare ourselves for a place in the world. Few of us have time to talk about<br />\nEurope and have discussions about world affairs.

When Wendell Wilkie told us about a perspective on the Hopkins<br />\nplan.<br />\n\"One World\" concept, he had two wars as testimony of the interAnd in doing this, I think I've found the universal<br />\ndependence of the community of nations. If we are selfish, we attitude of the Hopkins man to the problem. One<br />\nhad better look out for our selfish interests\u2014world war is not for Wilmer Turtleneck, class of '52, gave me what was<br />\nthe least intelligent, but probably the most widely<br />\nour selfish interests.<br />\nWhen Mrs Flesseman discusses post-war Europe, she discusses a continent whose every activity is a concern of ours. When<br />\nthis lady from Holland reminds us that the Europeans consider<br />\nAmerica a land of the \"Babbits and movie heros,\" she is reflecting the third alarm. Ours, as American college students, is<br />\ngrowing responsibility. We are reminded by commencement<br />\nspeakers, almost without exception, that the older generation ha<br />\na mess of things, that it's time the younger generation put tl<br />\nworld in order.<br />\nThere is more tocollege than books, Parties, and footb:<br />\ngames. Maybe the twenty students who came to hear Mrs Fle<br />\nman have discovered this elusive element. Perhaps the 17%<br />\nsupported Truman are aware of it:<br />\nIt is time we crawled out of our parents' povketbooks<br />\nlistened to the world. If not the hollow men will go out wit<br />\nbang and a wimper.<br /><br />\nheld opinion I've gotten so far. \"It's like this,\" he told me. \"When Dan Gilman,<br />\nBill Osler, and Tom Massey set this place up after<br />\nan evening at Ross', they didn't want no skoits<br />\nhangin' aroun'.

The dance<br />\nwas characterized by a Dogpatch atmosphere and<br />\nnothing stronger than \"Klckapoo Joy Juice.\" Saturday's Pigskin Hop has a worthy challenge from<br />\nthe freshman class.

George Wackenhut, coach of the Blue Jay team came into<br />\nthe dressing room of. his losing team and shouted,over the noise<br />\nof the celebrating Loyolans in the next room,\"You played a great<br />\ngame fellows. I'm proud of you.\" The contest had decided the<br />\nMason-Dixon championship.<br />\nAnd George had'a right to he proud of his boys. They had<br />\ncome within an ace of beating a team that was superior to them<br />\nin every department. They had lost the game in the final period<br />\nafter leading almost from the opening whistle a team that had<br />\nbeen picked to run riot over them. With a few breaks it could have<br />\nbeen a Black and Blue Championship. Certainly the soccermen<br />\nhad,every right to complain about the hand that had been dealt<br />\nthem. They controlled the ball for three-quarters of the game<br />\nonly to lose on several breaks that could have gone either way and<br />\nnone of which were of their making.<br />\nVICTORVIN DEFEAT<br />\nBut although the Jay looker room. was quiet and subdued by<br />\nthe loss it was also more than a little proud. Captain Bobby Lang,<br />\nwho had played in his last Mason-Dixon contest, shook his head<br />\nand said sadly, \"I guess it just wasn't to be. They were just too<br />\ngood,for us.\"<br />\n\"Billy\" Tulezogly sat quietly in the CDrner of the room and<br />\ncursed softly. It had kept two big Greyhounds busy all afternoon<br />\nto bottle up the tricky Jay center-forward and yet he had scored<br />\nhis team's two goals. He responded quickly to Coach Wackenhut's<br />\nroutine talk about pitching into Gettysburg next week with a<br />\ndetermined \"We'll beat 'em.\"<br />\nPerhaps Bill Kinling expressed the feeling of the squad better<br />\nthan anyone else. \"We may have lost but I had a right good time<br />\nPlaying this afternoon at that,\" he said. 'Wackenhut poked him<br />\nin the ribs and called to the rest of the squad,\"Kinling had a good<br />\ntime so I guess we satisfied the principles of physical education.\"<br />\nTHEY WANTED TO WIN<br />\nIt is not to be supposed fmm the above that the Hopkins<br />\nsoccer team was indifferent as to whether or not they won or lost.<br />\nThey fought and scrapped from the start of the game until it<br />\nended in almost total darkness. They played to with all they had<br />\nin them. George Pecorilla is the perfect example of the spirit of<br />\nthe team. He had only the slightest chance of seeing action that<br />\nafternoon but he played the entire game on the bench. He pleaded,<br />\nhe mocked, he screamed for \"jiust one More.\" And the rest of the<br />\nbench was the same way.<br />\nIt is a certainty that a Hopkins team cannot always win in<br />\nathletics.
