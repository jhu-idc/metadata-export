CATES.<br />\n<br />\nAlthough Hopkins won its second game of the season by defeating Washington College by a score<br />\nof 14 to 6, the game as a whole<br />\nwas disappointing to the coaches.<br />\nThis statement is made in the belief that Hopkins alumni desire to<br />\nknow the real situation with respect<br />\nto the team. We can be elated over<br />\nthe winning of a game, but we<br />\nshould not be blind to the weaknesses of our team developed by<br />\nthe game. Of course, the season is<br />\nstill young and we cannot expect at<br />\nthis stage either finished execution<br />\nof offensive play or impregnable defensive tactics against the offense of<br />\nthe opponents. In other words, it<br />\nis too early to expect a co-ordinated<br />\nteam offense or defense. It is not<br />\ntoo early, however, to expect individual men to do well certain<br />\nspecified acts which must be done<br />\nwell if team play is ever to be perfected.<br />\nThe disappointing feature of the<br />\ngame rested in the failure of men<br />\nto do the things which we know<br />\nthey know how to do and which<br />\nthey failed to do for some unaccountable psychological reason. For<br />\nexample, every man knows enough<br />\nabout the game to realize the importance of running down the field<br />\nunder a kick-off or punt. Not once<br />\nin the game did the team as a whole,<br />\nor an individual for that matter,<br />\nreally cover a kick. The reason for<br />\nthis can only be attributed to some<br />\nmental . deficiency which coaches<br />\ncannot supply. Failure to hear or<br />\ncomprehend the simplest signals;<br />\nfailure to tackle or hold a player<br />\nwhen tackled; failure to spill an<br />\nopponent when the only requisite<br />\nfor its accomplishment is ability to<br />\nfall down in front of him, are all<br />\nchargeable to the same deficiency.<br />\nIt's a question of mental attitude.<br />\nEach player must help in the working out of his own salvation. Until<br />\nour players develop a real desire to<br />\naccomplish a purpose so strong that<br />\nit will not be denied we cannot hope<br />\nfor real success. This desire is a<br />\npersonal matter. In some places it<br />\nis called \"spirit.\" *Whatever it is it<br />\nmust be worked out by the individual.<br />\nHopkins showed flashes of real<br />\nform in Saturday's game, but it<br />\nwas not sustained. We were very<br />\nfortunate to win. Too much praise<br />\ncannot be accorded the Washington<br />\nCollege team for its slap-dash,<br />\nslam-bang style of play.

CATES.<br /><br />\nAlthough Hopkins won its second game of the season by defeating Washington College by a score<br />\nof 14 to 6, the game as a whole<br />\nwas disappointing to the coaches.<br />\nThis statement is made in the belief that Hopkins alumni desire to<br />\nknow the real situation with respect<br />\nto the team. We can be elated over<br />\nthe winning of a game, but we<br />\nshould not be blind to the weaknesses of our team developed by<br />\nthe game. Of course, the season is<br />\nstill young and we cannot expect at<br />\nthis stage either finished execution<br />\nof offensive play or impregnable defensive tactics against the offense of<br />\nthe opponents. In other words, it<br />\nis too early to expect a co-ordinated<br />\nteam offense or defense. It is not<br />\ntoo early, however, to expect individual men to do well certain<br />\nspecified acts which must be done<br />\nwell if team play is ever to be perfected.<br />\nThe disappointing feature of the<br />\ngame rested in the failure of men<br />\nto do the things which we know<br />\nthey know how to do and which<br />\nthey failed to do for some unaccountable psychological reason. For<br />\nexample, every man knows enough<br />\nabout the game to realize the importance of running down the field<br />\nunder a kick-off or punt. Not once<br />\nin the game did the team as a whole,<br />\nor an individual for that matter,<br />\nreally cover a kick. The reason for<br />\nthis can only be attributed to some<br />\nmental . deficiency which coaches<br />\ncannot supply. Failure to hear or<br />\ncomprehend the simplest signals;<br />\nfailure to tackle or hold a player<br />\nwhen tackled; failure to spill an<br />\nopponent when the only requisite<br />\nfor its accomplishment is ability to<br />\nfall down in front of him, are all<br />\nchargeable to the same deficiency.<br />\nIt's a question of mental attitude.<br />\nEach player must help in the working out of his own salvation. Until<br />\nour players develop a real desire to<br />\naccomplish a purpose so strong that<br />\nit will not be denied we cannot hope<br />\nfor real success. This desire is a<br />\npersonal matter. In some places it<br />\nis called \"spirit.\" *Whatever it is it<br />\nmust be worked out by the individual.<br />\nHopkins showed flashes of real<br />\nform in Saturday's game, but it<br />\nwas not sustained. We were very<br />\nfortunate to win. Too much praise<br />\ncannot be accorded the Washington<br />\nCollege team for its slap-dash,<br />\nslam-bang style of play.
