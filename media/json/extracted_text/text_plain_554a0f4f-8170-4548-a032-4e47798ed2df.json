The recognition<br />\nof football by the Athletic Association last<br />\nOctober was perhaps the first outward symptom of the change. The introduction of<br />\nbasketball, the recognition of baseball, carried on bravely in the face of heavy discouragements, and the making of the ambitious football schedule of this year, are<br />\nall manifestations of the working of the new<br />\nSpirit. The season ticket plan grew out of<br />\nit. The organization of the Cotillon Club<br />\nshowed early last year that the same spirit<br />\nwas active in other fields besides athletics.<br />\nThe formation of the Dramatic Club, and the<br />\ncoming debate and chess match are merely<br />\nthe most recent results of the same great<br />\nmovement. It begins to look as if Hopkins<br />\nmight hope eventually to gain a position in<br />\nthe undergraduate world in some degree<br />\ncommensurate with the scholastic reputation<br />\nit already possesses.<br />\n<br />\nT<br />\n<br />\njustify any change in our opinion. The reason, however, is quite obvious. No member<br />\nof the Senior class has taken upon himsell<br />\nthe initiative of proposing the subject to that<br />\nclass in a direct form. So, fortunately, the<br />\nerror is one which may be easily rectified.<br />\nFrom what we have been able to gather from<br />\nthe student body and from what we know<br />\nto be the opinion of a number of graduates.<br />\nthere can be no doubt that a Hopkins night<br />\nat the theatre will be successful in every<br />\nway\u2014especially in point of a full attendance.<br />\nIt is the duty of the Senior class to give the<br />\nmovement a start, and we have every assurance that it will receive the heary approval<br />\nand co-operation of all Hopkins students.<br />\n<br />\nT is interesting to note the decay of hazing which has taken place recently at<br />\nseveral of our larger colleges\u2014notably<br />\nHarvard. The old doings of \"Bloody Monday,\" and nearly all similar events, have<br />\npractically been abolished, and now the<br />\nFreshman need have little fear of any physical maltreatment. Perhaps it is a mistake<br />\nto say \"abolished.\" Died out would be better.<br />\nThat is to say, conditions have so<br />\nchanged that hazing is of itself becoming<br />\nextinct. At Princeton, too, hazing has been<br />\nEVERAL weeks ago we called atten- voluntarily discontinued by the students,<br />\ntion to the fact that the custom o although there seems to be a temporary 1.1occasionally having a Hopkins night vival this eyar. It seems to us that some<br />\nat the theatre seems to be dying out. Since very important points can be drawn from<br />\nthat time nothing has occurred that would these two cases in regard to the question of<br />\n<br />\nS<br />\n<br />\nI<br />\n<br />\n\f2<br />\n<br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\n<br />\nabolishing hazing in colleges, which has been<br />\nso much to the fore recently. In the first<br />\nplace, it is useless for a faculty to say that<br />\nhazing shall be stopped. When the time has<br />\narrived it will stop of itself\u2014until then it<br />\nmust be tolerated. As long as conditions in<br />\nan institution are such that the students demand hazing, then hazing will continue. To<br />\ntry to overthrow the natural course of events<br />\nis just as impossible in this case as in any<br />\nother sphere of being.<br />\nHE first year ot the new system of<br />\ntutors at Princeton is, of course,<br />\nwatched with great interest by all<br />\ninterested in American education. How wii<br />\nthe tutors be able to traverse the ground<br />\ncovered by lectures they have not heard?<br />\nThis question is almost in the nature of a<br />\nproblem, and we recently heard a professor<br />\nwho has for many years been prominently<br />\nconnected with the University concerned say<br />\nthat there was some doubt in his mind how<br />\nthe difficulty could be obviated. It is probable that collateral readings will be assigned<br />\nto the students, and that the tutors wiil<br />\n\"quiz\" the men on the outside work. The<br />\nwhole object of the system seems to be to<br />\nget the student in closer touch with the<br />\nfaculty. At the Johns Hopkins, thanks to<br />\nthe relatively small size of the student body,<br />\nno such system is necessary, and we are<br />\ntherefore confronted by no such problem ae<br />\nthat which has come to the fore at Princeton.<br />\nAs Dr. Remsen has recently said, the small<br />\nUniversity has some very marked advantages over the large one. Ceratinly, we are<br />\nenabled to come into closer personal touch<br />\nwith the professors than we would, should<br />\nthe enrollment of students be greatly increased.<br />\n<br />\nT<br />\n<br />\nLL newspapers\u2014and in a broad sense<br />\nthe NEWS-LETTER may be included in<br />\nthat category\u2014pursue either one of<br />\ntwo policies in the preparation of their editorials. Either they endeavor to give a true<br />\nexpression of the trend of popular opinion,<br />\nadvocating only those measures which the<br />\npublic seems especially to desire; or they<br />\noriginate the measures themselves, endeavoring to swing the popular verdict by a skillful<br />\n<br />\nA<br />\n<br />\npresentation of their views. Both methods<br />\nhave decided advantages and disadvantages.<br />\nThe former policy fails to take into account<br />\nthe danger which must arise from supporting mistaken popular opinion; and in the<br />\nlatter policy, the views expressed tend to be<br />\nof too individualistic a character, therefore<br />\ncarrying little weight. This year, the NnwF.LETTER will make an especial effort to avoid<br />\nthe undesirable qualities of either method.<br />\nBut even more than this, it will endeavor to<br />\ngrasp the underlying yet inexpressed views<br />\nof the student body, and present them to its<br />\nreaders with some exactness of form. We<br />\nshall deem ourselves fortunate, if we succeed<br />\nin correctly interpreting some of the firm<br />\nbut silent convictions of the student body,<br />\nboth undergraduate and graduate.<br />\nN reading the daily papers last week,<br />\nthe editors of the N4w3-LETTER were<br />\nimpressed by an item in one of<br />\nthem, which stated that the faculty<br />\nof the Northwestern University had decided to hold daily quizzes on current topics. The faculty had come to<br />\nthis conclusion through their discovery that<br />\nalthough college men might be well up on<br />\nevents of the past, they are often woefully<br />\nignorant of the happenings of the present.<br />\nTheir decision is one which will probably<br />\nbe seriously considered by other colleges and<br />\nuniversities throughout the country. Failure to keep posted on current affairs while<br />\nat college, has doubtless been the main reason for the comparative scarcity of college<br />\nbred men in politics. A certain amount of<br />\nnewspaper and magazine reading is essential<br />\nto every man. Especially is it essential to<br />\na student, as an offset to the often justifiable<br />\nassertion that hard, grinding application to<br />\nbooks narrows a man's feelings and beliefs.<br />\n<br />\nI<br />\n<br />\nT<br />\n<br />\nHE NEWS-LETTtR will be perfectly<br />\n<br />\nfrank and admit that there is one<br />\ndepartment of the paper which has<br />\ncertainly shown no improvement for several<br />\nyears. We refer to the column headed<br />\n\"Alumni Notes.\" Now, why has this been<br />\nso? Because of the difficulty in collecting<br />\nnews of former students of the University.<br />\nWe have very few sources of such informa-<br />\n<br />\n\fTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\ntion except the students. In the majority<br />\nof cases, when we ask a man for alumni news;,<br />\nhe says that he can think of none. What we<br />\nwant to ask is that each undergraduate make<br />\nan effort to recall anything of interest which<br />\nhe may have heard concerning an alumnus.<br />\nWe are sure that every man knows several<br />\nalumni personally, and that he must frequently hear of some new item which concerns them. Certainly it would be little or<br />\nno trouble for a student to let us know when<br />\nanything comes to his notice. Let us hear<br />\nfrom as many fellows as possible, then, be\u2022<br />\nfore the next issue.<br />\nBOUT this time of the year the question of the advisability of holding<br />\nthe cane rush usually arises.<br />\nWe<br />\nconfess that we can see no reason except<br />\n<br />\nA<br />\n<br />\n3<br />\n<br />\ncustom for continuing the rush. We do not<br />\nbelieve the Hopkins Cane rush was ever a<br />\nnotable success. In the emasculated condition in which it existed last year, with<br />\ntwenty men on a side, it was certainly not<br />\nimposing. Worst of all, however, the method in which it is usually conducted robs it<br />\nof whatever success it would, under more<br />\nfavorable circumstances, achieve. As a rule,<br />\nthe rush is held after the class football game<br />\nis completely over, in semi-darkness, and<br />\namid such disorder and confusion that<br />\nneither spectators nor participants can get<br />\nany satisfaction out of it. Either abolish<br />\nthe cane rush this year, or by means of<br />\nproper regulation, give it a chance 10 succeed.<br />\n<br />\nLOGICAL FAILURES.<br />\nI like to study logic,<br />\nWe have it every day;<br />\nSome think 'tis very helpful,<br />\nIn a reasoning sort of way.<br />\nYet strange it is that oft at night,<br />\nIt doesn't seem to work out right.<br />\nIn arguments at college,<br />\nMy reasoning is quite fair,<br />\nI'm rapid at \"division,\"<br />\nAnd know my logic \"square.\"<br />\nYet home, why pop and sister, too,<br />\nCan wallop me right thro' and thro'.<br />\nAnd when I call on Betty,<br />\nAll logic seems forgot;<br />\nMy arguments persuasive<br />\nShe calls sure tommy-rot.<br />\n\u2014No argument could one devise,<br />\nTo match the light in Betty's eyes.<br />\nAnd so I've most decided,<br />\nThat logic is just right<br />\nIf only used at college\u2014<br />\nDiscarded quite at night.<br />\n(Which is most logical to do,<br />\nBacked up by home and Betty, too I)<br />\n<br />\n\f4<br />\n<br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\n<br />\nROUND-ABOUT WITH A SENIOR.<br />\nIII. THE TURN OF THE DIAL.<br />\nHE harsh groan of the ship's siren<br />\nsounded dismally, and as its vibrations echoed far bath the mist, the<br />\nforward watch shivered and stopped in his<br />\nmonotonous pacing to and fro to count off<br />\ntwo strokes on the big brass bell in the bow.<br />\nI wrapped my rug closer about me to shut<br />\nout the dank fog, and sucked miserable puffs<br />\nfrom my pipe. In truth, everything seemel<br />\nmiserable to me then; and it was with grim<br />\nhumor that I compared my future to the<br />\ndull colorless fog that hung ghost-like about<br />\nthe lighted cabin.<br />\n\"Happiness was only invented as a prologue to misery,\" I philosophized, as 1<br />\nclutched the damp sticky arm of my steamer<br />\nchair; and then added somewhat irrelevantly, \"Why did I ever meet her?\"<br />\n\"Bouillon, sir?\"<br />\n\"No Her,\" I snapped. And then, realizing the idiocy of my answer, turned to<br />\nglare at Biggs, the assistant steward. But<br />\nBiggs gazed abstractedly out into the blank<br />\nnothingness on the port bow, and held taward me a tray on which were two steaming<br />\ncups of bouillon. With rigid dignity, but<br />\nkeeping one eye on Biggs, I took one of th.3<br />\ncups.<br />\n\"For whom is the other cup?\" I asked<br />\nstiffly.<br />\n\"For Miss Harnold, sir. Hi thought she<br />\nwould be 'ere with you, sir.\"<br />\nI believed I detected a diabolical gleam<br />\nin Biggs' eye; and in an endeavor to appear<br />\nunconcerned, scalded my throat with the hot<br />\ncontents of my cup.<br />\n\"I am sure, Biggs, that I have no knowledge of Miss Arnold's whereabouts,\" I said<br />\nwith another miserable attempt at indifference.<br />\nBiggs took away the empty cup, but not<br />\nthe hateful conclusion which his manner had<br />\nimpressed upon me, that the world (or at<br />\nleast all that part confined within the beams<br />\n<br />\nT<br />\n<br />\nof the \"Greyhound\") was enjoying my snub<br />\nat the hands of Miss Jane Arnold.<br />\nThis blow to my fortunes had occurred at<br />\ndinner, before the eyes of the assembled<br />\npassengers and waiters. The snub was too<br />\nevident to escape the eyes of any. It diA<br />\nnot make me feel any better to sit there on<br />\ndeck cynically swearing at the fickleness of<br />\nwoman, while I knew that Biggs was discussing my humiliation with the cook in the<br />\ngalley.<br />\nMiss Jane Arnold had been the center or<br />\nattention ever since she had boarded the<br />\n\"Greyhound,\" five days before, at Liverpool. Her winning ways and captivating<br />\nsmiles had immediately made slaves of every<br />\nmale passenger in the first cabin. With<br />\nreally scandalous ease she had ordered each<br />\nand every one of us about, taking our service as a matter of course. Captain Cook,<br />\nusually gruff and boorish, actually gzi:azcd<br />\nwhen she made him show her the mysteries<br />\nof the pilot house; and more than once the<br />\nsecond mate had been compelled to call the<br />\nwatch sternly to attention when Miss Arnold was talking to her circle of admirers<br />\non the forward deck.<br />\nI puffed savagely when I recalled the<br />\nempty conceit I had held that she favored<br />\nmy suit above all others, and grimly reflected now upon the delight I had felt when she<br />\nmade me teach her shuffle-board.<br />\nThe evening before, we had sat together<br />\non deck watching the glorious plunge of the<br />\nsetting sun, and as her blond curls blew<br />\nacross my face, I had solemnly sworn my<br />\neternal devotion to her and my intention to<br />\nwait until papa should consent. With her<br />\nlarge blue eyes turned toward me she had<br />\nplaced her soft little hand on mine and<br />\nwhispered a joyful answer to my words.<br />\nBut now, all was over! The happiness<br />\nwhich her words had instilled into me was<br />\n<br />\n\fTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\nbut the prologue to the misery which had<br />\nexisted for me since dinner.<br />\nWith joy overflowing, I had escorted her<br />\nto the dining room, and led her to a chair<br />\nbeside mine. All the passengers had taken<br />\ntheir places save those whom sea-sickness<br />\ndetained, and as we entered, all eyes were<br />\nturned on us. Pride swelled in my breast<br />\nas I noted the look of envy which the men<br />\neast at me, and with a conscious flourish, I<br />\nwhirled into position the chair I had meant<br />\nfor her to occupy.<br />\nThen the Captain spoke. \"Miss Arnold,\"<br />\nhe said, \"the chair at my side, usually oc-<br />\n<br />\n5<br />\n<br />\ncupied by Mrs. Van Tyler, has been made<br />\ntemporarily vacant by the exigencies of the<br />\ndeep.

They also modestly desire to select the subject. Hopkins will<br />\nprobably yield on the points of place and<br />\nsubject, but will endeavor to have the date<br />\ndeferred until about April 1, in order to<br />\nallow the annual class debate to take place<br />\nat its accustomed time. A challenge has<br />\nalso been received from George Washington<br />\nUniversity, but will be declined.<br />\nVirginia has long been noted for the excellence of its debaters.

Washington,<br />\nthe Johns Hopkins eleven will line up against<br />\nthe Mt. Washington Club in what is, from<br />\na local standpoint, probably our most important game. Should Hopkins win to-morrow<br />\nand defeat the University of Maryland on<br />\nThanksgiving Day, and should Mt. Washington defeat the Maryland Athletic Club, then<br />\nthe undoubted championship of the State<br />\nwill belong to the black and blue eleven.<br />\nLast year both Hopkins and the Maryland<br />\nAthletic Club defeated Mt.

The signal was for<br />\na punt, but the pass was bad and there was<br />\nno chance for a kick, so Michael tucked the<br />\nball under his arm and lurched through the<br />\nWashington line for 25 yards, dodging all<br />\nwho came near him..<br />\nMagoffin played half for the first time this<br />\nyear, and showed his ability on line bucks<br />\nand end runs.<br />\nBayless played a strong game and in the<br />\nsecond half eluded every one except Stevenson, the Washington quarter, who saved the<br />\nday for his team by a brilliant tackle.<br />\nA private car containing many Hopkins<br />\nrooters went over to Washington, and those<br />\nwho took the trouble to go that distance to<br />\nsupport their college were well repaid by<br />\nthe quality of football displayed. Among<br />\nthe people bearing Hopkins colors were seen<br />\nmany ladies who had come over to cheer the<br />\nblack and blue, and on the whole Baltimore<br />\nwas very well represented in the grand<br />\nstand.<br />\nThe line-up:\u2014<br />\nCenter, Preble; guards, Michael and Moss;<br />\n<br />\ntackles, Campbell, Haas and Farr; ends, MacSherry,<br />\nHart and Estes; quarter-back, Iglehart and Brotherhood; half-backs, Bayless and Magoffin; full-back,<br />\nWorthington (capt.).<br />\n<br />\n\fTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\n<br />\n9<br />\n<br />\nsinging.

The recognition<br />\nof football by the Athletic Association last<br />\nOctober was perhaps the first outward symptom of the change. The introduction of<br />\nbasketball, the recognition of baseball, carried on bravely in the face of heavy discouragements, and the making of the ambitious football schedule of this year, are<br />\nall manifestations of the working of the new<br />\nSpirit. The season ticket plan grew out of<br />\nit. The organization of the Cotillon Club<br />\nshowed early last year that the same spirit<br />\nwas active in other fields besides athletics.<br />\nThe formation of the Dramatic Club, and the<br />\ncoming debate and chess match are merely<br />\nthe most recent results of the same great<br />\nmovement. It begins to look as if Hopkins<br />\nmight hope eventually to gain a position in<br />\nthe undergraduate world in some degree<br />\ncommensurate with the scholastic reputation<br />\nit already possesses.<br /><br />\nT<br /><br />\njustify any change in our opinion. The reason, however, is quite obvious. No member<br />\nof the Senior class has taken upon himsell<br />\nthe initiative of proposing the subject to that<br />\nclass in a direct form. So, fortunately, the<br />\nerror is one which may be easily rectified.<br />\nFrom what we have been able to gather from<br />\nthe student body and from what we know<br />\nto be the opinion of a number of graduates.<br />\nthere can be no doubt that a Hopkins night<br />\nat the theatre will be successful in every<br />\nway\u2014especially in point of a full attendance.<br />\nIt is the duty of the Senior class to give the<br />\nmovement a start, and we have every assurance that it will receive the heary approval<br />\nand co-operation of all Hopkins students.<br /><br />\nT is interesting to note the decay of hazing which has taken place recently at<br />\nseveral of our larger colleges\u2014notably<br />\nHarvard. The old doings of \"Bloody Monday,\" and nearly all similar events, have<br />\npractically been abolished, and now the<br />\nFreshman need have little fear of any physical maltreatment. Perhaps it is a mistake<br />\nto say \"abolished.\" Died out would be better.<br />\nThat is to say, conditions have so<br />\nchanged that hazing is of itself becoming<br />\nextinct. At Princeton, too, hazing has been<br />\nEVERAL weeks ago we called atten- voluntarily discontinued by the students,<br />\ntion to the fact that the custom o although there seems to be a temporary 1.1occasionally having a Hopkins night vival this eyar. It seems to us that some<br />\nat the theatre seems to be dying out. Since very important points can be drawn from<br />\nthat time nothing has occurred that would these two cases in regard to the question of<br /><br />\nS<br /><br />\nI<br /><br />\n2<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br /><br />\nabolishing hazing in colleges, which has been<br />\nso much to the fore recently. In the first<br />\nplace, it is useless for a faculty to say that<br />\nhazing shall be stopped. When the time has<br />\narrived it will stop of itself\u2014until then it<br />\nmust be tolerated. As long as conditions in<br />\nan institution are such that the students demand hazing, then hazing will continue. To<br />\ntry to overthrow the natural course of events<br />\nis just as impossible in this case as in any<br />\nother sphere of being.<br />\nHE first year ot the new system of<br />\ntutors at Princeton is, of course,<br />\nwatched with great interest by all<br />\ninterested in American education. How wii<br />\nthe tutors be able to traverse the ground<br />\ncovered by lectures they have not heard?<br />\nThis question is almost in the nature of a<br />\nproblem, and we recently heard a professor<br />\nwho has for many years been prominently<br />\nconnected with the University concerned say<br />\nthat there was some doubt in his mind how<br />\nthe difficulty could be obviated. It is probable that collateral readings will be assigned<br />\nto the students, and that the tutors wiil<br />\n\"quiz\" the men on the outside work. The<br />\nwhole object of the system seems to be to<br />\nget the student in closer touch with the<br />\nfaculty. At the Johns Hopkins, thanks to<br />\nthe relatively small size of the student body,<br />\nno such system is necessary, and we are<br />\ntherefore confronted by no such problem ae<br />\nthat which has come to the fore at Princeton.<br />\nAs Dr. Remsen has recently said, the small<br />\nUniversity has some very marked advantages over the large one. Ceratinly, we are<br />\nenabled to come into closer personal touch<br />\nwith the professors than we would, should<br />\nthe enrollment of students be greatly increased.<br /><br />\nT<br /><br />\nLL newspapers\u2014and in a broad sense<br />\nthe NEWS-LETTER may be included in<br />\nthat category\u2014pursue either one of<br />\ntwo policies in the preparation of their editorials. Either they endeavor to give a true<br />\nexpression of the trend of popular opinion,<br />\nadvocating only those measures which the<br />\npublic seems especially to desire; or they<br />\noriginate the measures themselves, endeavoring to swing the popular verdict by a skillful<br /><br />\nA<br /><br />\npresentation of their views. Both methods<br />\nhave decided advantages and disadvantages.<br />\nThe former policy fails to take into account<br />\nthe danger which must arise from supporting mistaken popular opinion; and in the<br />\nlatter policy, the views expressed tend to be<br />\nof too individualistic a character, therefore<br />\ncarrying little weight. This year, the NnwF.LETTER will make an especial effort to avoid<br />\nthe undesirable qualities of either method.<br />\nBut even more than this, it will endeavor to<br />\ngrasp the underlying yet inexpressed views<br />\nof the student body, and present them to its<br />\nreaders with some exactness of form. We<br />\nshall deem ourselves fortunate, if we succeed<br />\nin correctly interpreting some of the firm<br />\nbut silent convictions of the student body,<br />\nboth undergraduate and graduate.<br />\nN reading the daily papers last week,<br />\nthe editors of the N4w3-LETTER were<br />\nimpressed by an item in one of<br />\nthem, which stated that the faculty<br />\nof the Northwestern University had decided to hold daily quizzes on current topics. The faculty had come to<br />\nthis conclusion through their discovery that<br />\nalthough college men might be well up on<br />\nevents of the past, they are often woefully<br />\nignorant of the happenings of the present.<br />\nTheir decision is one which will probably<br />\nbe seriously considered by other colleges and<br />\nuniversities throughout the country. Failure to keep posted on current affairs while<br />\nat college, has doubtless been the main reason for the comparative scarcity of college<br />\nbred men in politics. A certain amount of<br />\nnewspaper and magazine reading is essential<br />\nto every man. Especially is it essential to<br />\na student, as an offset to the often justifiable<br />\nassertion that hard, grinding application to<br />\nbooks narrows a man's feelings and beliefs.<br /><br />\nI<br /><br />\nT<br /><br />\nHE NEWS-LETTtR will be perfectly<br /><br />\nfrank and admit that there is one<br />\ndepartment of the paper which has<br />\ncertainly shown no improvement for several<br />\nyears. We refer to the column headed<br />\n\"Alumni Notes.\" Now, why has this been<br />\nso? Because of the difficulty in collecting<br />\nnews of former students of the University.<br />\nWe have very few sources of such informa-<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\ntion except the students. In the majority<br />\nof cases, when we ask a man for alumni news;,<br />\nhe says that he can think of none. What we<br />\nwant to ask is that each undergraduate make<br />\nan effort to recall anything of interest which<br />\nhe may have heard concerning an alumnus.<br />\nWe are sure that every man knows several<br />\nalumni personally, and that he must frequently hear of some new item which concerns them. Certainly it would be little or<br />\nno trouble for a student to let us know when<br />\nanything comes to his notice. Let us hear<br />\nfrom as many fellows as possible, then, be\u2022<br />\nfore the next issue.<br />\nBOUT this time of the year the question of the advisability of holding<br />\nthe cane rush usually arises.<br />\nWe<br />\nconfess that we can see no reason except<br /><br />\nA<br /><br />\n3<br /><br />\ncustom for continuing the rush. We do not<br />\nbelieve the Hopkins Cane rush was ever a<br />\nnotable success. In the emasculated condition in which it existed last year, with<br />\ntwenty men on a side, it was certainly not<br />\nimposing. Worst of all, however, the method in which it is usually conducted robs it<br />\nof whatever success it would, under more<br />\nfavorable circumstances, achieve. As a rule,<br />\nthe rush is held after the class football game<br />\nis completely over, in semi-darkness, and<br />\namid such disorder and confusion that<br />\nneither spectators nor participants can get<br />\nany satisfaction out of it. Either abolish<br />\nthe cane rush this year, or by means of<br />\nproper regulation, give it a chance 10 succeed.<br /><br />\nLOGICAL FAILURES.<br />\nI like to study logic,<br />\nWe have it every day;<br />\nSome think 'tis very helpful,<br />\nIn a reasoning sort of way.<br />\nYet strange it is that oft at night,<br />\nIt doesn't seem to work out right.<br />\nIn arguments at college,<br />\nMy reasoning is quite fair,<br />\nI'm rapid at \"division,\"<br />\nAnd know my logic \"square.\"<br />\nYet home, why pop and sister, too,<br />\nCan wallop me right thro' and thro'.<br />\nAnd when I call on Betty,<br />\nAll logic seems forgot;<br />\nMy arguments persuasive<br />\nShe calls sure tommy-rot.<br />\n\u2014No argument could one devise,<br />\nTo match the light in Betty's eyes.<br />\nAnd so I've most decided,<br />\nThat logic is just right<br />\nIf only used at college\u2014<br />\nDiscarded quite at night.<br />\n(Which is most logical to do,<br />\nBacked up by home and Betty, too I)<br /><br />\n4<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br /><br />\nROUND-ABOUT WITH A SENIOR.<br />\nIII. THE TURN OF THE DIAL.<br />\nHE harsh groan of the ship's siren<br />\nsounded dismally, and as its vibrations echoed far bath the mist, the<br />\nforward watch shivered and stopped in his<br />\nmonotonous pacing to and fro to count off<br />\ntwo strokes on the big brass bell in the bow.<br />\nI wrapped my rug closer about me to shut<br />\nout the dank fog, and sucked miserable puffs<br />\nfrom my pipe. In truth, everything seemel<br />\nmiserable to me then; and it was with grim<br />\nhumor that I compared my future to the<br />\ndull colorless fog that hung ghost-like about<br />\nthe lighted cabin.<br />\n\"Happiness was only invented as a prologue to misery,\" I philosophized, as 1<br />\nclutched the damp sticky arm of my steamer<br />\nchair; and then added somewhat irrelevantly, \"Why did I ever meet her?\"<br />\n\"Bouillon, sir?\"<br />\n\"No Her,\" I snapped. And then, realizing the idiocy of my answer, turned to<br />\nglare at Biggs, the assistant steward. But<br />\nBiggs gazed abstractedly out into the blank<br />\nnothingness on the port bow, and held taward me a tray on which were two steaming<br />\ncups of bouillon. With rigid dignity, but<br />\nkeeping one eye on Biggs, I took one of th.3<br />\ncups.<br />\n\"For whom is the other cup?\" I asked<br />\nstiffly.<br />\n\"For Miss Harnold, sir. Hi thought she<br />\nwould be 'ere with you, sir.\"<br />\nI believed I detected a diabolical gleam<br />\nin Biggs' eye; and in an endeavor to appear<br />\nunconcerned, scalded my throat with the hot<br />\ncontents of my cup.<br />\n\"I am sure, Biggs, that I have no knowledge of Miss Arnold's whereabouts,\" I said<br />\nwith another miserable attempt at indifference.<br />\nBiggs took away the empty cup, but not<br />\nthe hateful conclusion which his manner had<br />\nimpressed upon me, that the world (or at<br />\nleast all that part confined within the beams<br /><br />\nT<br /><br />\nof the \"Greyhound\") was enjoying my snub<br />\nat the hands of Miss Jane Arnold.<br />\nThis blow to my fortunes had occurred at<br />\ndinner, before the eyes of the assembled<br />\npassengers and waiters. The snub was too<br />\nevident to escape the eyes of any. It diA<br />\nnot make me feel any better to sit there on<br />\ndeck cynically swearing at the fickleness of<br />\nwoman, while I knew that Biggs was discussing my humiliation with the cook in the<br />\ngalley.<br />\nMiss Jane Arnold had been the center or<br />\nattention ever since she had boarded the<br />\n\"Greyhound,\" five days before, at Liverpool. Her winning ways and captivating<br />\nsmiles had immediately made slaves of every<br />\nmale passenger in the first cabin. With<br />\nreally scandalous ease she had ordered each<br />\nand every one of us about, taking our service as a matter of course. Captain Cook,<br />\nusually gruff and boorish, actually gzi:azcd<br />\nwhen she made him show her the mysteries<br />\nof the pilot house; and more than once the<br />\nsecond mate had been compelled to call the<br />\nwatch sternly to attention when Miss Arnold was talking to her circle of admirers<br />\non the forward deck.<br />\nI puffed savagely when I recalled the<br />\nempty conceit I had held that she favored<br />\nmy suit above all others, and grimly reflected now upon the delight I had felt when she<br />\nmade me teach her shuffle-board.<br />\nThe evening before, we had sat together<br />\non deck watching the glorious plunge of the<br />\nsetting sun, and as her blond curls blew<br />\nacross my face, I had solemnly sworn my<br />\neternal devotion to her and my intention to<br />\nwait until papa should consent. With her<br />\nlarge blue eyes turned toward me she had<br />\nplaced her soft little hand on mine and<br />\nwhispered a joyful answer to my words.<br />\nBut now, all was over!

The signal was for<br />\na punt, but the pass was bad and there was<br />\nno chance for a kick, so Michael tucked the<br />\nball under his arm and lurched through the<br />\nWashington line for 25 yards, dodging all<br />\nwho came near him..<br />\nMagoffin played half for the first time this<br />\nyear, and showed his ability on line bucks<br />\nand end runs.<br />\nBayless played a strong game and in the<br />\nsecond half eluded every one except Stevenson, the Washington quarter, who saved the<br />\nday for his team by a brilliant tackle.<br />\nA private car containing many Hopkins<br />\nrooters went over to Washington, and those<br />\nwho took the trouble to go that distance to<br />\nsupport their college were well repaid by<br />\nthe quality of football displayed.
