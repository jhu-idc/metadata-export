The<br />\nprimary cause of this obscurity<br />\nhas been charged to negligible<br />\nsupport from the SAC, under-<br />\n<br />\ngraduate and graduate apathy,<br />\nneglect by the administration,<br />\nand unresourceful, though, supposedly, highly concerned and<br />\nmotivated former editors.<br />\nAll these reasons are true,<br />\n<br />\nPhotopgraphy Editor<br />\nAl Cohen<br />\nStudent Activities Editor<br />\nRon Spector<br />\n<br />\nArts Editor<br />\nBob Landau<br />\n<br />\nBusiness Managers<br />\nTom Smith<br />\n<br />\nJack (Pock<br />\n<br />\nA Shot In The Dark<br />\nIt is shocking to view the mass irresponsibility of<br />\nthe students enrolled at the University of Mississippi,<br />\nfor it is on their hands rather than on the hands of<br />\ntheir elders that the bloodstains of immaturity and wishful thinking will remain.<br />\nWith conservative restraint on our part, the governor and people of the oligarchy of \"Ole Miss\" can be<br />\ngranted ignorance, prejudice and an outdated position<br />\non states rights. However, more restraint is needed in<br />\nevaluating the effect of outright affirmations of white<br />\nsupremacy on the student hotly of the University of<br />\nMississippi.<br />\nRiots on the part of university students start in<br />\nour opinion, because of their intrinsic excitement, not<br />\nfor purposes of forwarding causes. As University students ourselves we can sympathize with the efforts of<br />\nmaturing adolescents who, in their maturing, endeavor<br />\nto create jovial collegiate atmospheres, and who often<br />\nindulge in wanton frivolity as they face the burdens of<br />\nadult life.<br />\nHowever, we can but marvel and be frightened at<br />\nthe gross inability of Mississippi students to take a<br />\npositive position on the singular issue of international<br />\nsignificance which occurred not only on ground upon<br />\nwhich they tread, but on ground which we presume<br />\nthey love.<br />\nMissing from our headlines and the news stories of<br />\nour press are orderly and thoughtful protests on the<br />\npart of Mississippi students on any position whatsoever.<br />\nWe do not doubt that they did vocalize, but are shocked<br />\nat their lack of ingenuity in provoking at least some<br />\nform of passive protest to the events ensuent in Oxford.<br />\nWe read only of the yielding to professional agitators by the percentage-wise few university students remaining in Oxford. Or, we read of their mass exodus<br />\nhomeward to enjoy a week of vacation while the world's<br />\neyes are focused on historical events which they could<br />\nhave changed.<br />\nWe are frightened to speculate that this passivity<br />\nrepresents the general attitude among American undergraduates. If we view the situation in Mississippi as a<br />\nunique emergency giv ing two reactions, namely mass<br />\nhysteria or mass unconcern, we may be understating ihe<br />\nsituation. Nevertheless, the question remains: Are the<br />\nreactions evoked in this extreme ease typical of those our<br />\ncontemporaries would give in a more universal<br />\nemergency?<br />\n<br />\nA Positive Contribution<br />\nThis year's student leaders have brought an unprecedented degree of organization to Hopkins undergraduate affairs. As we were promised, there are more<br />\ncommittees, involving more participants in student government, than ever before.<br />\nWe are pleasantly surprised to note that, in general,<br />\nthe newly created Student Council committees will, besides inducing greater participation in student government, meet real needs. The committee to investigate work,<br />\nstudy and travel abroad can provide a centralized source<br />\nof information where one has long been sorely wanted.<br />\nLikewise. the \"Committee to Re-evaluate Student Activities Funds\" is in a position materially to improve a<br />\nmarginal situation.<br />\nIf, however, any real value is to come from this<br />\ngreat re-organization, it must avoid the pomposity which<br />\nhas defeated similar efforts in the past. One has only<br />\nto recall last year's unfortunate incident of the Gentleman's Code Commission to see how self importance can<br />\nlead to organization for its own sake, an unrewarding<br />\nif not absolutely ridiculous spectacle.<br />\nIf it avoids this tempting pitfall, and there is<br />\nevery reason to hope that it will, the New Order may<br />\nmake a significant positive contribution to the Homewood scene.<br />\n<br />\nA Word From The Wise<br />\nWe would like to issue a reminder that the NewsLetter will, as it has in the past, maintain the Veritas<br />\nVos Liberabit column for any member of the Hopkins<br />\ncommunity who wishes to disburden himself of well<br />\nphrased opinion and/or comment.

This, however,<br />\nshould not hopefully sound like<br />\na plea of submission or for the<br />\ncommutation of what seems to<br />\nbe the universally accepted belief that Channels is or will soon<br />\nbe defunct.

The<br />\nprimary cause of this obscurity<br />\nhas been charged to negligible<br />\nsupport from the SAC, under-<br /><br />\ngraduate and graduate apathy,<br />\nneglect by the administration,<br />\nand unresourceful, though, supposedly, highly concerned and<br />\nmotivated former editors.<br />\nAll these reasons are true,<br /><br />\nPhotopgraphy Editor<br />\nAl Cohen<br />\nStudent Activities Editor<br />\nRon Spector<br /><br />\nArts Editor<br />\nBob Landau<br /><br />\nBusiness Managers<br />\nTom Smith<br /><br />\nJack (Pock<br /><br />\nA Shot In The Dark<br />\nIt is shocking to view the mass irresponsibility of<br />\nthe students enrolled at the University of Mississippi,<br />\nfor it is on their hands rather than on the hands of<br />\ntheir elders that the bloodstains of immaturity and wishful thinking will remain.<br />\nWith conservative restraint on our part, the governor and people of the oligarchy of \"Ole Miss\" can be<br />\ngranted ignorance, prejudice and an outdated position<br />\non states rights. However, more restraint is needed in<br />\nevaluating the effect of outright affirmations of white<br />\nsupremacy on the student hotly of the University of<br />\nMississippi.<br />\nRiots on the part of university students start in<br />\nour opinion, because of their intrinsic excitement, not<br />\nfor purposes of forwarding causes. As University students ourselves we can sympathize with the efforts of<br />\nmaturing adolescents who, in their maturing, endeavor<br />\nto create jovial collegiate atmospheres, and who often<br />\nindulge in wanton frivolity as they face the burdens of<br />\nadult life.<br />\nHowever, we can but marvel and be frightened at<br />\nthe gross inability of Mississippi students to take a<br />\npositive position on the singular issue of international<br />\nsignificance which occurred not only on ground upon<br />\nwhich they tread, but on ground which we presume<br />\nthey love.<br />\nMissing from our headlines and the news stories of<br />\nour press are orderly and thoughtful protests on the<br />\npart of Mississippi students on any position whatsoever.<br />\nWe do not doubt that they did vocalize, but are shocked<br />\nat their lack of ingenuity in provoking at least some<br />\nform of passive protest to the events ensuent in Oxford.<br />\nWe read only of the yielding to professional agitators by the percentage-wise few university students remaining in Oxford. Or, we read of their mass exodus<br />\nhomeward to enjoy a week of vacation while the world's<br />\neyes are focused on historical events which they could<br />\nhave changed.<br />\nWe are frightened to speculate that this passivity<br />\nrepresents the general attitude among American undergraduates. If we view the situation in Mississippi as a<br />\nunique emergency giv ing two reactions, namely mass<br />\nhysteria or mass unconcern, we may be understating ihe<br />\nsituation. Nevertheless, the question remains: Are the<br />\nreactions evoked in this extreme ease typical of those our<br />\ncontemporaries would give in a more universal<br />\nemergency?<br /><br />\nA Positive Contribution<br />\nThis year's student leaders have brought an unprecedented degree of organization to Hopkins undergraduate affairs. As we were promised, there are more<br />\ncommittees, involving more participants in student government, than ever before.<br />\nWe are pleasantly surprised to note that, in general,<br />\nthe newly created Student Council committees will, besides inducing greater participation in student government, meet real needs. The committee to investigate work,<br />\nstudy and travel abroad can provide a centralized source<br />\nof information where one has long been sorely wanted.<br />\nLikewise. the \"Committee to Re-evaluate Student Activities Funds\" is in a position materially to improve a<br />\nmarginal situation.<br />\nIf, however, any real value is to come from this<br />\ngreat re-organization, it must avoid the pomposity which<br />\nhas defeated similar efforts in the past. One has only<br />\nto recall last year's unfortunate incident of the Gentleman's Code Commission to see how self importance can<br />\nlead to organization for its own sake, an unrewarding<br />\nif not absolutely ridiculous spectacle.<br />\nIf it avoids this tempting pitfall, and there is<br />\nevery reason to hope that it will, the New Order may<br />\nmake a significant positive contribution to the Homewood scene.<br /><br />\nA Word From The Wise<br />\nWe would like to issue a reminder that the NewsLetter will, as it has in the past, maintain the Veritas<br />\nVos Liberabit column for any member of the Hopkins<br />\ncommunity who wishes to disburden himself of well<br />\nphrased opinion and/or comment. While we welcome<br />\ncontributions to this open column from students, faculty, administration and friends of the University, the<br />\neditors reserve the right of final decision on what will<br />\nappear in this space.<br /><br />\n14,11-?.10.1<br /><br />\n14ediaotewaadScene<br />\nBy T.

This, however,<br />\nshould not hopefully sound like<br />\na plea of submission or for the<br />\ncommutation of what seems to<br />\nbe the universally accepted belief that Channels is or will soon<br />\nbe defunct.

Some say that seniors know less English than freshmen<br />\nbecause all seniors major in French. This is not true. No more<br />\nthan 94 percent of seniors major in French. How about the<br />\nother six percent?<br />\nWell sir, of the other six percent, half\u2014or three percent\u2014<br />\ntake physics, and it is not hard to understand how these poor<br />\nsouls grow rusty in English when all they ever say is \"E equals<br />\nMC squared.\"<br />\nOf the remaining three percent, two-thirds\u2014or two percent\u2014<br />\nmajor in whaling, and their English too grows feeble with<br />\ndisuse. Whalers, as we all know, do not speak at all except to<br />\nshout, \"Thar she blows!\" maybe twice a year.<br />\nOf the one percent remaining, it cannot be fairly said that<br />\nthey are poor writers. The fact is, we don't know what kind of<br />\nwriters they are. Why not? Because they never write. And why<br />\ndon't they ever write? Because this remaining one percent of<br />\nAmerican college students are enrolled at the University of<br />\nAlaska, and never take their mittens off.<br />\n(Incidentally, I received quite a surprise upon first visiting<br />\nAlaska two years ago when I was invited to Juneau to crown<br />\nthe Queen of the Annual Date Palm Festival.
