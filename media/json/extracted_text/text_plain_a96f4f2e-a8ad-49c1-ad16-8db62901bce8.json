Two great storms<br />\nand much fine sailing. It was biting cold as<br />\nwe.were hauled out of the Brooklyn slip. But<br />\nwhen the pilot was dropped and the land lost<br />\nto view, the air came mild and we were tucked<br />\nup in our rugs in the steamer-chairs on deck.<br />\nThere we have lived, to all unpractical ends<br />\ntwo solid weeks, a lazy, loafing, good for nothing lot,\u2014tho' just a trifle chipper now that we<br />\nare on the Mediterranean, with fine sunny days<br />\nand a famous moon at night.<br />\n<br />\nNo. 7.<br />\n<br />\nthe dining-room. The little wooden racks were<br />\nsttetched along the tables: to help you keep<br />\nthe identity of your plate and knife and fork,<br />\nand as a needed precaution against the summary landing of your breakfast,tout and scramble, in your lap. I took my first lesson in balancing a cup of coffee in one hand while I<br />\nstabbed for a piece of steak with the other.<br />\nThis, however, is a trifle rhetorical. I did do it<br />\nagain! This first morning I made my breakfast<br />\non a bit of dry toast, and cleared out of the<br />\nstuffy cabin post haste. I knew my safety was<br />\nin fresh air, in deep and copious breaths. At<br />\nthe risk of a ducking I spent the day on deck,<br />\nlashed to my steamer-chair.<br />\nThe ocean was glorious. I have lived for<br />\nthis. The low and scudding clouds. The sea<br />\nlashed to a fury. Now raised up in a great<br />\nwall, then levelled, torn in a thousand scraps<br />\nof foaming white. Up, Up, UP! and the eye<br />\nlooks out alone on the wet, gray sky. The<br />\nsurge and rush of the wave,and the black water<br />\nis hissing at your feet. You clutch the arms of<br />\nyour chair. Vast, illimitable, lonely waters.<br />\nMajestic. Powerful. The Living Sea.<br />\nser W W<br />\n<br />\nThe worst of it was over with the second<br />\nAi<br />\nnight, and the day following we had the wind<br />\nSunday, our third day out, was pleasant sail- in the west, abaft, with the long swells pressing<br />\ning. A sermon from one of the four ministers after us, and chasing on and past us, while the<br />\naboard! (There are mutterings in the \"fo' screw threshed out a snarl.<br />\ncastle.\" The steward predicts \"tough luck!\")<br />\nThe \"ship's company\" crawled up on deck<br />\nAlong about sun-down we got a little motion like half-drowned rats, and entered into the felon. It is breezing up a bit. Several passengers lowship of a common misery.<br />\ngo down with the sun. The visible list is<br />\nWe had two or three days of fine sailing then.<br />\ndepleted.<br />\nI 'ried to read. What foolishness to have loaded<br />\nWhen I came up on deck the following morn- down my bag with books! Your eyes steal<br />\ning, Blue Monday! A heavy gale was on from furtively from the page to the broad sea, and<br />\nthe south. It was blowing like a nautical you come back with a start after a half-hour's<br />\nnovel. As our course was due east we were dreaming. (0, foolish first voyager! As if<br />\nright in the trough of the sea and rolling on Old Ocean were not better than a book.) The<br />\nour scuppers. Five or six only of our forty sky and the sea, but multitude changes! A bit<br />\npassengers answered the breakfast call. The of sun, a rainbow, a matchless green in the<br />\nberth-cabin is in a state of collapse!

It<br />\nwas a nor'easter. The mate called it \"a<br />\nbreeze.\" We lost a rail. There was a boat<br />\nstove in.<br />\nUntil you get out on the ocean, a thousand<br />\nmiles from anywhere, with the wind howling<br />\nlike a dervish and the seas smashing on the<br />\nbow, in the long, black night: to feel your shell<br />\nof a ship lifted up, the pound of the sea, the<br />\nmighty shudder of the frame, the creaking of<br />\ntimbers, the sullen rush of waters on the deck,\u2014<br />\ntill then, you have two or three emotions<br />\nunrealized. And when, after three days of this,<br />\nthe sea conies calm and you make out the first<br />\nbit of land you have seen for near a fortnight,<br />\nthen if never before, you are glad for the good<br />\ngift of life, and you go out on deck, alone, and<br />\nlift up your eyes unto the hills.<br />\n.116 .116.A6<br />\nHere we are in Naples!

Every selection given received applause enough to justify an encore;<br />\nand, indeed the most severe criticism of the<br />\nconcert WaS made with reference to the length<br />\nof the program. A great many encores were<br />\nresponded to, and the evening was thereby<br />\nprolonged.<br />\nThe men were inspired by this encouragement,<br />\nand enthusiasm succeeded the anxiety at first<br />\napparent behind the scenes. The Clubs sang and<br />\nplayed with a spirit that put to rout the heavy<br />\npredictions of failure, aroused by the early date<br />\nset for the concert. Last year it was held March<br />\n23. In no year have the Clubs played in Baltimore<br />\nbelbre Lent. A great deal of credit is due to the<br />\nmanagement and to the individual members of<br />\nthe 1901 Clubs for the hard work they have<br />\ndone during the fall. On this evening Stephen<br />\nHarwood sang his last songs for the J H. U.<br />\nThe audience did not seem satisfied, even after<br />\nhe had appeared on the stage five times. Swindell was also warmly applauded for his \"Miss<br />\nPeoebe\" and for other selections.<br />\nThe Glee Club, with \"My Bed is like a Little<br />\nBoat,\" seemed to cause the greatest pleasure of<br />\nthe evening. This Club is now in fine form as a<br />\nresult of its good training. More first tenors,<br />\nhowever, would help the balance of the Club;<br />\nand every Hopkins man who can make a high<br />\nG is urged to apply.<br />\nThe Banjo and Mandolin Clubs gave excellent<br />\nperformances. They contain much good material, which will be even better next year, as a<br />\nlarge proportion of the men are now in their<br />\nfirst season.<br />\nThe next trip of the Clubs will be made to<br />\nAnnapolis on the 26th. The management is<br />\nbeing besieged .by requests for another Baltimore Concert, and it is hoped that one can be<br />\narranged<br />\n\u2014R. S. L.<br />\n<br />\n\fTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\nHOPKINS IN THE INAUGURAL<br />\nPARADE.<br />\nTo all Hopkins Men:\u2014<br />\njust a word now seems in order as regards our<br />\ndelegation to the Inaugural Parade of March<br />\n4th. Since it was unanimously decided at the<br />\nmeeting held in Hopkins Hall, Friday, January<br />\n11th, that we should contribute a delegation to<br />\nthe intercollegiate part of the parade, now is<br />\nthe time for every loyal Hopkins man to stand<br />\nby his University and help the good cause. And<br />\nnow that we have so enthusiastically started<br />\nout,let us do it right,and in such a manner that<br />\nevery one of us will feel proud to say that the<br />\nJ. H. U. delegation was the largest, the best<br />\nequipped, the best drilled, and altogether the<br />\nfinest body of college men in line. Many of the<br />\nother colleges have already signified their intention of being represented,so I am quite confident<br />\nthat we shall have many worthy associates with<br />\nus in line. When it is considered what are our<br />\nadvantages over the more distant colleges, it<br />\nshould make every fellow feel ashamed after the<br />\nfourth of March to admit that he was not one<br />\nof the sturdy grenadiers.<br />\nThe benefits arising from such a display are<br />\nmany. The most important of all is the advertisement and public notice that will be given our<br />\nUniversity. This in itself should be enough to<br />\narouse any latent feelings in knowing that by<br />\nthus exposing himself to the most enjoyable<br />\ntime of his life he is at the same time upholding<br />\nthe dignity and bringing renown to his college.<br />\nHere is where an excellent chance is afforded for<br />\ndisplaying our far-famed intellectual abilities.<br />\nBesides, the cost of the whole affair will amount<br />\nto so very little that the good time offered will<br />\namply repay the expenditure.<br />\nThe intention of the Committee is to provide a<br />\nbrass band to accompany us.\u2014Right now let it<br />\nbe understood that the route of the parade will<br />\nextend only from the Capitol to the White House,<br />\nso there is no need of training for long distance<br />\nwalking.\u2014To insure a quick passage to Washington special cars or a train if necessary, will<br />\nbe secured for our accommodation,and arrangements will be made with some restaurant so<br />\n<br />\n3<br />\n<br />\nthat dinner will be served immediately before<br />\nthe starting of the procession. The official uniform will be black and blue jerseys or sweaters,<br />\nand Hopkins hats, and a cane.<br />\nIf possible, small flags to be fastened on the<br />\ncanes will be presented each man, and banners<br />\nwill be secured for the festivous occasion.<br />\nTo do all this, more or less capital is absolutely required, hence the need of generous contribution from every man in the University. Even if<br />\nyou can't go you are interested in the welfare;<br />\ntherefore the need for a little generosity. Remember the only expense, outside of the purchasing of your costume, will be the dollar railroad fare and the price of a Washington dinner.<br />\nAnd now, dear sirs, I sincerely trust you comprehend the gravity of our cause and will notify<br />\nmembers of the committee at once that you will<br />\nmarch with us and help carry the glorious banner of our dear Alma Mater, giving evidence<br />\nthereby to President Mac. that we will stand<br />\nby him, even if some of us don't entirely believe<br />\nin his principles.<br />\n<br />\nJ. ABNER SAYLER,JR.,<br />\nChairman.<br />\n<br />\nA LIBERAL OFFER.<br />\nTrustees of the University have decided to<br />\nTHE<br />\noffer twenty Maryland Scholarships, in addition to those already offered in the catalogue.<br />\nThe offer is made for the academic year beginning September, 1901, and is for the benefit of<br />\nall parts ofthe State. Accordingly not more than<br />\none-half of the number will be awarded to residents of the city and county of Baltimore, and<br />\nnot more than one-half to those who are now<br />\nmembers of the University, as is seen by the last<br />\nclause. This offer is a rich one for next year's<br />\nFreshman class, as it is that class that will be<br />\nlargely benefitted by it. Considering the present financial condition of Hopkins, the offer is a<br />\nmost generous one, and it is to be hoped will go<br />\ntoward bringing the rural residents of Maryland to a realization of the fact that such a University as this extends its influence, not only<br />\nover Baltimore and Maryland, but over America<br />\n\u2014ay, and over the world.<br />\n<br />\n\fTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\n<br />\n4<br />\n<br />\n\"C be Ilews.ILetter.<br />\nPublished Fortnightly during the University Year by the<br />\nStudents of THE JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY.<br />\n<br />\nJANUARY 24, 1901.<br />\nSubscription $1.50 per year.<br />\nEditor in Chief,<br />\n<br />\n10 cents a single copy.<br />\n.<br />\n<br />\n.<br />\n<br />\nAssociate Editor in Chief,<br />\nNews Editors,<br />\nAthletic Editors,<br />\nBusiness Manager,<br />\n<br />\n.<br />\n<br />\nNORMAN BOYER, 1901.<br />\n<br />\nJOHN M.

We<br />\ncan not enter a league with Swarthmore and<br />\nLehigh, as some of our men would perhaps like,<br />\nbecause Lehigh is going to stick to Stevens, and<br />\nwe may not he able to accept the invitation of<br />\nthe northern Inter-University League on account<br />\nof some strange relations which we have with<br />\nSwarthmore. So we may be forced this season<br />\nto follow a policy of independence, and attempt<br />\nto maintain our previous standing as the superior of any college team that may be sent against<br />\nUS.<br />\n<br />\nTo do this will require the hardest kind of<br />\nwork, faithful and consistent practice, and intelligent following of the instructions of the<br />\ncoaches. The practice that has been going on<br />\nin the cage since the beginning of the term has<br />\nbeen very good in its way, but it has been desultory and participated in by too few men who<br />\nhave real ability and ambition to make the<br />\nteam. Captain Tyler is trying to interest the<br />\nmen in the work,but he is very much dissatisfied<br />\nwith the way in which they respond to his appeals. The Freshmen have always been very<br />\nenthusiastic supporters of lacrosse, and the<br />\npresent Senior and Junior classes furnished a<br />\nnumber of extremely valuable players to the<br />\nwinning teams of 1899 and 1900. The Freshmen this year have not as yet measured up<br />\n<br />\nto their opportunities, and only one or two men<br />\nfrom that class have done work sufficient to<br />\nwarrant serious consideration.<br />\nThe class of 1903 owes it to itself not to be<br />\nfound deficient in interest and to the University<br />\nnot to be remiss in its athletic duty.<br />\n-U<br />\nN another column we print a letterfrom J. Abner<br />\nSayler, Jr., Chairman of the Committee of Arrangements of the proposed Hopkins representation in the Inaugural Parade at Washington. We<br />\ntake pleasure in publishing his appeal for support of this movement. It is especially proper<br />\nthat we should have a fine representation there<br />\nor none at all. That we are to send a body of<br />\nmen to Washington to march has been determined upon. It would have been humiliating if<br />\nwe had not so determined, and will be if that<br />\ndetermination is not carried out. Being but<br />\nforty miles from the Capital, we should be able<br />\nto send a delegation equal to those of Harvard<br />\nand Yale, which are hundreds of miles distant,<br />\nand the absence of any place at all in the line<br />\nwould reflect badly upon our energy and importance as a college body.<br />\nThere is, too,one other most important reason<br />\nwhy Hopkins should be represented. It may not<br />\nbe known to all that credit for the suggestion of<br />\nthis whole scheme of intercollegiate participation is given to the McKinley Club of this<br />\nUniversity, which wrote some weeks ago asking<br />\nfor a place in line. To suggest a movement and<br />\nthen be unable to follow it up is not an encouraging state of affairs. Let the McKinley Club<br />\nlook to it that the movement is successfully<br />\ncarried out.<br />\nor w<br />\nThe concert of the Musical Clubs given at<br />\nLehmann's Hall on the eleventh was a very<br />\nenjoyable affair, and was generally considered<br />\nan improvement over that of last season.

He should have been invited<br />\nto stop off in this city and visit the University,<br />\nwhere no doubt any number of men would have<br />\nbeen only too willing to conduct their guest over<br />\nthe broad expanse of our magnificent athletic<br />\ngrounds and show him our champion crews<br />\npracticing their stroke on the bosom of that<br />\ngentle stream where the waters softly lap the<br />\npiers of Union Station and the Charles Street<br />\nbridge.<br />\n<br />\n5<br />\n<br />\nA STRAIN OF MUSIC.<br />\nMusic, they say, has charms to soothe the breast<br />\nOf savage beasts, or bend the knotted oak,<br />\nTo wake the soul that slumbers in its shell,<br />\nAnd noble hearts to noble deeds convoke.<br />\nThere is a strain of music, which at times<br />\nFloats to my ear from some dim,unknown source,<br />\nBefore whose pulsing notes my soul doth sink,<br />\nO'ercotne with sadness, longing and remorse.<br />\nTo free myself I cannot, nor yet would;<br />\nA fascination holds me in its power,<br />\nThis strange, wild sadness charms while yet it chides,<br />\nAnd sweetly mournful seems the flitting hour.<br />\nAnd then a change comes o'er this strange, wierd<br />\ndream;<br />\nI hear the roaring of the lonely woods,<br />\nThe north wind soughs with melancholy wail,<br />\nAnd nature shows the saddest of her moods.<br />\nIt is the long-stilled music of the past<br />\nThat strikes its mournful chord within my soul;<br />\nThough wild the source, yet pleasant are the notes,<br />\nThe tides of thought, how strange their ceaseless<br />\nflow<br />\n\u2014N.

Mr. Harwood's selections were especially well received, and remarks<br />\namong the 50\u2014cent critics were in abundance<br />\nabout the easy time he would have on the stage.<br />\n\"We'll miss Harwood next year, he is going<br />\nto be\u2014i. e.; he is going to resign from the<br />\nClubs; but say isn't he great? why did they<br />\never place him before Swindell on the program?<br />\nSwindell is good, even excellent; but then,<br />\nHarwood is great, and they ought to have<br />\nknown the difficulty Swindell would have in<br />\novercoming comparisons with Harwood.

I<br />\nwish I could write lyrics, I would put words to<br />\nit. That is just the kind of air we need.\" The<br />\nsuggestion was good, and there are others with<br />\ndesires to write lyrics.<br />\n<br />\n\"The quartet is excellent, and those new<br />\nsongs are delightfully funny. Sorry that they<br />\nhave no more.\" That was the consensus of<br />\nopinion of the standing roomers,and apparently<br />\nof the whole audience. In fact the Glee Club<br />\nstood at the head of the performance both in<br />\nquality and quantity. All their selections except<br />\nMy Lady Lu were modern, and what that<br />\nlacked in newness was made up by its melody<br />\nand spirit. So early in the season when so few<br />\nof the comic operas have stood the test of<br />\nBaltimore audiences,it is difficult to select pieces<br />\nthat are \"catchy,\" without recourse to resurrecting by-gone successes, and when so many<br />\nencores are demanded the difficulty is made<br />\ndouble.<br />\nWW<br />\n<br />\nThe gentleman from whom the Mandola was<br />\nprocured made his appearance late in the evening,<br />\nand was much surprised at the efficient manner<br />\nin which Mr. Edgeworth Smith handled it.<br />\n\"That is the only one in the country, in fact,<br />\nthe only one ever made here, and we were lucky<br />\nin getting hold of it. Mr. Smith came down<br />\ntwo days ago, and wanted to tackle it in the<br />\nconcert, and though we very much feared that<br />\nthe undertaking was too difficult we willingly<br />\noffered the Mandola to him. So there he is<br />\nplaying it now, and playing it well.\" It certainly sounded weird and odd to hear the deeptoned instrument play a solo for the first few<br />\nbars of Slippery Quaker, but it was a novelty<br />\nthat pleased.<br />\nOr<br />\n<br />\n\"The Banjo Club is playing in great time, and<br />\nis getting more music out of the instruments<br />\nthan you generally hear from a banjo. It seems<br />\nto me that they are beating last year's work.<br />\nLast year the Mandolin Club was far superior<br />\nto the Banjo Club, but this year the Mandolin<br />\nClub has fallen off somewhat. They do not<br />\nplay as softly, or with such continuity; there<br />\nis too much individual work, and too many<br />\nstrums'\u2014to use Stephen Crane's word. The<br />\ntime is good, but the result does not give one<br />\nthe orchestral effect that it did last year.\" The<br />\nman who uttered these remarks just then went<br />\nout, and I do not know whether he was a<br />\nmusical critic or not.<br />\n<br />\nW<br />\n<br />\nAfter the concert was over, it was the general<br />\nopinion that on the whole it was a most enjoyable and creditable performance. The selections<br />\nwere good; the renditions with so little training<br />\nexcellent; and as for quantity, the thirty pieces<br />\nshould have furnished a variety fit for all sorts<br />\nand conditions of hearers.

Two great storms<br />\nand much fine sailing. It was biting cold as<br />\nwe.were hauled out of the Brooklyn slip. But<br />\nwhen the pilot was dropped and the land lost<br />\nto view, the air came mild and we were tucked<br />\nup in our rugs in the steamer-chairs on deck.<br />\nThere we have lived, to all unpractical ends<br />\ntwo solid weeks, a lazy, loafing, good for nothing lot,\u2014tho' just a trifle chipper now that we<br />\nare on the Mediterranean, with fine sunny days<br />\nand a famous moon at night.<br /><br />\nNo. 7.<br /><br />\nthe dining-room. The little wooden racks were<br />\nsttetched along the tables: to help you keep<br />\nthe identity of your plate and knife and fork,<br />\nand as a needed precaution against the summary landing of your breakfast,tout and scramble, in your lap. I took my first lesson in balancing a cup of coffee in one hand while I<br />\nstabbed for a piece of steak with the other.<br />\nThis, however, is a trifle rhetorical. I did do it<br />\nagain! This first morning I made my breakfast<br />\non a bit of dry toast, and cleared out of the<br />\nstuffy cabin post haste. I knew my safety was<br />\nin fresh air, in deep and copious breaths. At<br />\nthe risk of a ducking I spent the day on deck,<br />\nlashed to my steamer-chair.<br />\nThe ocean was glorious. I have lived for<br />\nthis. The low and scudding clouds. The sea<br />\nlashed to a fury. Now raised up in a great<br />\nwall, then levelled, torn in a thousand scraps<br />\nof foaming white. Up, Up, UP! and the eye<br />\nlooks out alone on the wet, gray sky. The<br />\nsurge and rush of the wave,and the black water<br />\nis hissing at your feet.

A heavy gale was on from furtively from the page to the broad sea, and<br />\nthe south. It was blowing like a nautical you come back with a start after a half-hour's<br />\nnovel. As our course was due east we were dreaming. (0, foolish first voyager! As if<br />\nright in the trough of the sea and rolling on Old Ocean were not better than a book.) The<br />\nour scuppers.

There was a boat<br />\nstove in.<br />\nUntil you get out on the ocean, a thousand<br />\nmiles from anywhere, with the wind howling<br />\nlike a dervish and the seas smashing on the<br />\nbow, in the long, black night: to feel your shell<br />\nof a ship lifted up, the pound of the sea, the<br />\nmighty shudder of the frame, the creaking of<br />\ntimbers, the sullen rush of waters on the deck,\u2014<br />\ntill then, you have two or three emotions<br />\nunrealized. And when, after three days of this,<br />\nthe sea conies calm and you make out the first<br />\nbit of land you have seen for near a fortnight,<br />\nthen if never before, you are glad for the good<br />\ngift of life, and you go out on deck, alone, and<br />\nlift up your eyes unto the hills.<br />\n.116 .116.A6<br />\nHere we are in Naples!

Every selection given received applause enough to justify an encore;<br />\nand, indeed the most severe criticism of the<br />\nconcert WaS made with reference to the length<br />\nof the program. A great many encores were<br />\nresponded to, and the evening was thereby<br />\nprolonged.<br />\nThe men were inspired by this encouragement,<br />\nand enthusiasm succeeded the anxiety at first<br />\napparent behind the scenes. The Clubs sang and<br />\nplayed with a spirit that put to rout the heavy<br />\npredictions of failure, aroused by the early date<br />\nset for the concert. Last year it was held March<br />\n23. In no year have the Clubs played in Baltimore<br />\nbelbre Lent. A great deal of credit is due to the<br />\nmanagement and to the individual members of<br />\nthe 1901 Clubs for the hard work they have<br />\ndone during the fall. On this evening Stephen<br />\nHarwood sang his last songs for the J H. U.<br />\nThe audience did not seem satisfied, even after<br />\nhe had appeared on the stage five times. Swindell was also warmly applauded for his \"Miss<br />\nPeoebe\" and for other selections.<br />\nThe Glee Club, with \"My Bed is like a Little<br />\nBoat,\" seemed to cause the greatest pleasure of<br />\nthe evening. This Club is now in fine form as a<br />\nresult of its good training. More first tenors,<br />\nhowever, would help the balance of the Club;<br />\nand every Hopkins man who can make a high<br />\nG is urged to apply.<br />\nThe Banjo and Mandolin Clubs gave excellent<br />\nperformances. They contain much good material, which will be even better next year, as a<br />\nlarge proportion of the men are now in their<br />\nfirst season.<br />\nThe next trip of the Clubs will be made to<br />\nAnnapolis on the 26th. The management is<br />\nbeing besieged .by requests for another Baltimore Concert, and it is hoped that one can be<br />\narranged<br />\n\u2014R. S. L.<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\nHOPKINS IN THE INAUGURAL<br />\nPARADE.<br />\nTo all Hopkins Men:\u2014<br />\njust a word now seems in order as regards our<br />\ndelegation to the Inaugural Parade of March<br />\n4th. Since it was unanimously decided at the<br />\nmeeting held in Hopkins Hall, Friday, January<br />\n11th, that we should contribute a delegation to<br />\nthe intercollegiate part of the parade, now is<br />\nthe time for every loyal Hopkins man to stand<br />\nby his University and help the good cause. And<br />\nnow that we have so enthusiastically started<br />\nout,let us do it right,and in such a manner that<br />\nevery one of us will feel proud to say that the<br />\nJ. H. U. delegation was the largest, the best<br />\nequipped, the best drilled, and altogether the<br />\nfinest body of college men in line. Many of the<br />\nother colleges have already signified their intention of being represented,so I am quite confident<br />\nthat we shall have many worthy associates with<br />\nus in line. When it is considered what are our<br />\nadvantages over the more distant colleges, it<br />\nshould make every fellow feel ashamed after the<br />\nfourth of March to admit that he was not one<br />\nof the sturdy grenadiers.<br />\nThe benefits arising from such a display are<br />\nmany. The most important of all is the advertisement and public notice that will be given our<br />\nUniversity. This in itself should be enough to<br />\narouse any latent feelings in knowing that by<br />\nthus exposing himself to the most enjoyable<br />\ntime of his life he is at the same time upholding<br />\nthe dignity and bringing renown to his college.<br />\nHere is where an excellent chance is afforded for<br />\ndisplaying our far-famed intellectual abilities.<br />\nBesides, the cost of the whole affair will amount<br />\nto so very little that the good time offered will<br />\namply repay the expenditure.<br />\nThe intention of the Committee is to provide a<br />\nbrass band to accompany us.\u2014Right now let it<br />\nbe understood that the route of the parade will<br />\nextend only from the Capitol to the White House,<br />\nso there is no need of training for long distance<br />\nwalking.\u2014To insure a quick passage to Washington special cars or a train if necessary, will<br />\nbe secured for our accommodation,and arrangements will be made with some restaurant so<br /><br />\n3<br /><br />\nthat dinner will be served immediately before<br />\nthe starting of the procession. The official uniform will be black and blue jerseys or sweaters,<br />\nand Hopkins hats, and a cane.<br />\nIf possible, small flags to be fastened on the<br />\ncanes will be presented each man, and banners<br />\nwill be secured for the festivous occasion.<br />\nTo do all this, more or less capital is absolutely required, hence the need of generous contribution from every man in the University. Even if<br />\nyou can't go you are interested in the welfare;<br />\ntherefore the need for a little generosity. Remember the only expense, outside of the purchasing of your costume, will be the dollar railroad fare and the price of a Washington dinner.<br />\nAnd now, dear sirs, I sincerely trust you comprehend the gravity of our cause and will notify<br />\nmembers of the committee at once that you will<br />\nmarch with us and help carry the glorious banner of our dear Alma Mater, giving evidence<br />\nthereby to President Mac. that we will stand<br />\nby him, even if some of us don't entirely believe<br />\nin his principles.<br /><br />\nJ. ABNER SAYLER,JR.,<br />\nChairman.<br /><br />\nA LIBERAL OFFER.<br />\nTrustees of the University have decided to<br />\nTHE<br />\noffer twenty Maryland Scholarships, in addition to those already offered in the catalogue.<br />\nThe offer is made for the academic year beginning September, 1901, and is for the benefit of<br />\nall parts ofthe State. Accordingly not more than<br />\none-half of the number will be awarded to residents of the city and county of Baltimore, and<br />\nnot more than one-half to those who are now<br />\nmembers of the University, as is seen by the last<br />\nclause. This offer is a rich one for next year's<br />\nFreshman class, as it is that class that will be<br />\nlargely benefitted by it. Considering the present financial condition of Hopkins, the offer is a<br />\nmost generous one, and it is to be hoped will go<br />\ntoward bringing the rural residents of Maryland to a realization of the fact that such a University as this extends its influence, not only<br />\nover Baltimore and Maryland, but over America<br />\n\u2014ay, and over the world.<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br /><br />\n4<br /><br />\n\"C be Ilews.ILetter.<br />\nPublished Fortnightly during the University Year by the<br />\nStudents of THE JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY.<br /><br />\nJANUARY 24, 1901.<br />\nSubscription $1.50 per year.<br />\nEditor in Chief,<br /><br />\n10 cents a single copy.<br />\n.<br /><br />\n.<br /><br />\nAssociate Editor in Chief,<br />\nNews Editors,<br />\nAthletic Editors,<br />\nBusiness Manager,<br /><br />\n.<br /><br />\nNORMAN BOYER, 1901.<br /><br />\nJOHN M.

We<br />\ncan not enter a league with Swarthmore and<br />\nLehigh, as some of our men would perhaps like,<br />\nbecause Lehigh is going to stick to Stevens, and<br />\nwe may not he able to accept the invitation of<br />\nthe northern Inter-University League on account<br />\nof some strange relations which we have with<br />\nSwarthmore. So we may be forced this season<br />\nto follow a policy of independence, and attempt<br />\nto maintain our previous standing as the superior of any college team that may be sent against<br />\nUS.<br /><br />\nTo do this will require the hardest kind of<br />\nwork, faithful and consistent practice, and intelligent following of the instructions of the<br />\ncoaches. The practice that has been going on<br />\nin the cage since the beginning of the term has<br />\nbeen very good in its way, but it has been desultory and participated in by too few men who<br />\nhave real ability and ambition to make the<br />\nteam. Captain Tyler is trying to interest the<br />\nmen in the work,but he is very much dissatisfied<br />\nwith the way in which they respond to his appeals. The Freshmen have always been very<br />\nenthusiastic supporters of lacrosse, and the<br />\npresent Senior and Junior classes furnished a<br />\nnumber of extremely valuable players to the<br />\nwinning teams of 1899 and 1900. The Freshmen this year have not as yet measured up<br /><br />\nto their opportunities, and only one or two men<br />\nfrom that class have done work sufficient to<br />\nwarrant serious consideration.<br />\nThe class of 1903 owes it to itself not to be<br />\nfound deficient in interest and to the University<br />\nnot to be remiss in its athletic duty.<br />\n-U<br />\nN another column we print a letterfrom J. Abner<br />\nSayler, Jr., Chairman of the Committee of Arrangements of the proposed Hopkins representation in the Inaugural Parade at Washington. We<br />\ntake pleasure in publishing his appeal for support of this movement. It is especially proper<br />\nthat we should have a fine representation there<br />\nor none at all. That we are to send a body of<br />\nmen to Washington to march has been determined upon. It would have been humiliating if<br />\nwe had not so determined, and will be if that<br />\ndetermination is not carried out. Being but<br />\nforty miles from the Capital, we should be able<br />\nto send a delegation equal to those of Harvard<br />\nand Yale, which are hundreds of miles distant,<br />\nand the absence of any place at all in the line<br />\nwould reflect badly upon our energy and importance as a college body.<br />\nThere is, too,one other most important reason<br />\nwhy Hopkins should be represented. It may not<br />\nbe known to all that credit for the suggestion of<br />\nthis whole scheme of intercollegiate participation is given to the McKinley Club of this<br />\nUniversity, which wrote some weeks ago asking<br />\nfor a place in line. To suggest a movement and<br />\nthen be unable to follow it up is not an encouraging state of affairs. Let the McKinley Club<br />\nlook to it that the movement is successfully<br />\ncarried out.<br />\nor w<br />\nThe concert of the Musical Clubs given at<br />\nLehmann's Hall on the eleventh was a very<br />\nenjoyable affair, and was generally considered<br />\nan improvement over that of last season. All<br />\nthe numbers were well rendered, and the progra.11 was arranged with evident taste. Harwood was in his best form, and his songs were<br />\nrendered in a style that proves that his voice has<br />\nlost none of its charm.<br />\nBut in the *ay of what may be helpful criticism, does it not seem that a little less of the<br />\nboisterous element might do just as well? Not<br /><br />\nI<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\nthat we want the formality of a Boston Symphony by any means, but then you know things<br />\ncan be a little overdone sometimes.<br />\nsr sr sr<br />\nThe committee which is making arrankements<br />\nfor the Feed expects to introduce some new<br />\nfeatures which will make this year's affair differ<br />\nmarkedly from those of the past two seasons.<br />\nIt is to be hoped that they may be enabled to<br />\ncarry out their ideas, and that they may not be<br />\nimpeded by any false modesty on the part of<br />\nthose who are desired to participate. Every<br />\nfellow, especially the Freshman, should feel it a<br />\npleasant duty to assist in any way to make the<br />\nevening enjoyable. A determined effort is to be<br />\nmade to interest the Alumni in the affair,and no<br />\nstudent should remain away if it is possible for<br />\nhim to attend.<br />\nslif sir ser<br /><br />\nLONDON OPINIONS OF HOPKINS.<br /><br />\nONE,<br /><br />\nof the editors of this paper was the<br />\ncompanion for a brief hour one<br />\nnight last week of Mr. Alfred Harmsworth, the<br />\ndistinguished millionaire-editor of the London<br />\nDaily Mail, as he journeyed southward in his<br />\nparlor car attached to the special train enroute<br />\nfor St. Augustine, Florida.<br />\nMr. Harmsworth asserted his familiarity with<br />\nthe fame of the Johns Hopkins University and<br />\nits Medical School, and paid a tribute to the<br />\nrenown of Dr. William Osler of the Medical<br />\nFaculty. \"Your Medical School,\" he said, \"is<br />\nwithout doubt the best in this country, and as<br />\na heart specialist I believe that Dr. Osler is<br />\nperhaps the best in the world.\" Mr. Harmsworth asked a number of interesting questions<br />\nrelative to the actions of Hopkins students, and<br />\ninquired particularly where they rowed and had<br />\ntheir cricket field. He should have been invited<br />\nto stop off in this city and visit the University,<br />\nwhere no doubt any number of men would have<br />\nbeen only too willing to conduct their guest over<br />\nthe broad expanse of our magnificent athletic<br />\ngrounds and show him our champion crews<br />\npracticing their stroke on the bosom of that<br />\ngentle stream where the waters softly lap the<br />\npiers of Union Station and the Charles Street<br />\nbridge.<br /><br />\n5<br /><br />\nA STRAIN OF MUSIC.<br />\nMusic, they say, has charms to soothe the breast<br />\nOf savage beasts, or bend the knotted oak,<br />\nTo wake the soul that slumbers in its shell,<br />\nAnd noble hearts to noble deeds convoke.<br />\nThere is a strain of music, which at times<br />\nFloats to my ear from some dim,unknown source,<br />\nBefore whose pulsing notes my soul doth sink,<br />\nO'ercotne with sadness, longing and remorse.<br />\nTo free myself I cannot, nor yet would;<br />\nA fascination holds me in its power,<br />\nThis strange, wild sadness charms while yet it chides,<br />\nAnd sweetly mournful seems the flitting hour.<br />\nAnd then a change comes o'er this strange, wierd<br />\ndream;<br />\nI hear the roaring of the lonely woods,<br />\nThe north wind soughs with melancholy wail,<br />\nAnd nature shows the saddest of her moods.<br />\nIt is the long-stilled music of the past<br />\nThat strikes its mournful chord within my soul;<br />\nThough wild the source, yet pleasant are the notes,<br />\nThe tides of thought, how strange their ceaseless<br />\nflow<br />\n\u2014N.

Mr. Harwood's selections were especially well received, and remarks<br />\namong the 50\u2014cent critics were in abundance<br />\nabout the easy time he would have on the stage.<br />\n\"We'll miss Harwood next year, he is going<br />\nto be\u2014i. e.; he is going to resign from the<br />\nClubs; but say isn't he great? why did they<br />\never place him before Swindell on the program?<br />\nSwindell is good, even excellent; but then,<br />\nHarwood is great, and they ought to have<br />\nknown the difficulty Swindell would have in<br />\novercoming comparisons with Harwood.

Several of the rear enders<br />\nimmediately took up the air, and still we hear<br />\nit. \"That's a great air for a college song. I<br />\nwish I could write lyrics, I would put words to<br />\nit. That is just the kind of air we need.\" The<br />\nsuggestion was good, and there are others with<br />\ndesires to write lyrics.<br /><br />\n\"The quartet is excellent, and those new<br />\nsongs are delightfully funny. Sorry that they<br />\nhave no more.\" That was the consensus of<br />\nopinion of the standing roomers,and apparently<br />\nof the whole audience.
