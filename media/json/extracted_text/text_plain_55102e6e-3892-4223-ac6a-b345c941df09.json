H.<br />\n<br />\nA Foul Fowl<br />\nAlthough the Jayword's \"Fall\" issue, which didn't<br />\nreach the open market until January 14, attempted, upon<br />\nfour occasions, to slander the News-Letter, we shall guffaw<br />\nat its enfeebled effort, regard it beneath our dignity to<br />\nretaliate with unfounded barbs, and instead offer some<br />\nconstructive criticism.<br />\nWe might suggest that the editorial board tuck its<br />\ncollective heads under its clipped wing, and totter back to<br />\nthe nest; but we do believe that. it can do better. This<br />\nissue was \"so distasteful that it (wasn't) ... fit for wrapping fish\", let alone fowl. Editors, you exhibited a reluctance to flash your own wit, an outrageously poor choice<br />\nof jokes and cartoons, and an incapacity to spell, and sightless proof-reading.<br />\nThe editorial contained seven spelling mistakes, none<br />\nof which can be attributed to incompetent typing or mismanagement at the printers (the entire issue incorporated<br />\n25 spelling errors). Editor Parkinson exhibited a resplendent array of Spanish terms, only one of which was spelled<br />\nzorrectly. Reference to President Eisenhower as \"Milty\"<br />\nwas unparalleled in its wit. We rejoiced as the bird<br />\nbloated its feathered breast, thus announcing that this<br />\nissue was \"dirtier\" than ever. But we couldn't unearth<br />\none speck ot dirt, other than that some superhuman steelworker ogled once at \"a pair of particularly well-formed<br />\nbreasts.\" At this we rejoice.<br />\nWe sugge-st that if the Jayword ever desires to rank<br />\nwith the most malignine of other campus' humor magazines that it reorganizes. The editors of any such publication should be competent writers and humorists. Their<br />\nbrainstorms, not solely the works of sundry creative writing students and incompetent cartoonists, should .compose<br />\nmost of the pages. Jokes should not be antiquated; serious<br />\npoetry has no place in a \"slightly bigger, tougher and<br />\ndirtier Jayword\"; articles such as \"JAYWORD AWARDS<br />\nFOR OUTSTANDING ACHIEVEMENT\" are overworked<br />\nin high school weeklies.<br />\nTf you want to be dirty, be dirty. A foremost requisite<br />\nof an excellent humor magazine editor is a quick wit<br />\ncoupled with a filthy mind. And we don't mind being<br />\nvilified, but, please, spell the News-Letter correctly.

(Here) there is no<br />\nwaste of human energy, no duplication.\"<br />\nProfessor Nowinski<br />\nexplained to your reporter that<br />\nin Polish universities it is unheard of to mix mechanical engineers with physics majors or<br />\nmath majors in the same classroom. Each one attends a special course geared for his eventual job. Contrasted with this is<br />\nthe U. S. picture of classrooms<br />\nof pre-meds, engineers, math<br />\nmajors,,and chemistry majors all<br />\nreceiving the same math instruction, no matter what their particular field is.<br />\n<br />\nAnother very pleasant feature is<br />\nthe easiness of movement; the<br />\nhighways are excellent.\" Continuing, he added, \"The supply,<br />\nof food is something unusual\u2014<br />\nthere are no such big stores in<br />\nEurope. There is plenty of food<br />\nand a variety of food.\" Professor<br />\nNowinski wondered how it was<br />\npossible for the U. S. to be so<br />\nstrong industrially and<br />\nalso<br />\nhave such an abundance and<br />\nvariety of food.<br />\nAs far as the Professor's work<br />\nis concerned, he is quite interested in scientific research, perhaps more than teaching. Though<br />\nhe does want to lecture, he feels,<br />\nin his own words, that \"the centroid of my activities here be put<br />\non research work.\"<br />\n<br />\nImpressions of Faculty<br />\nWhen asked about his impressions of the faculty here,<br />\nProfessor Nowinski was happy to<br />\nsay that the level of his colleagues is very high. Carefully<br />\nwording his phrases, he added<br />\nthat \"The infiltration of new<br />\ntrends and programs in science<br />\nis much quicker (here) than<br />\nanywhere else. Its connections<br />\nwith life and practice\" said the<br />\nProfessor, \"are very vivid.\"<br />\n<br />\nYes, behind that door with the<br />\nwhite plaque in Maryland ,Hall<br />\nis a very happy man.

This<br />\nissue was \"so distasteful that it (wasn't) ... fit for wrapping fish\", let alone fowl. Editors, you exhibited a reluctance to flash your own wit, an outrageously poor choice<br />\nof jokes and cartoons, and an incapacity to spell, and sightless proof-reading.<br />\nThe editorial contained seven spelling mistakes, none<br />\nof which can be attributed to incompetent typing or mismanagement at the printers (the entire issue incorporated<br />\n25 spelling errors). Editor Parkinson exhibited a resplendent array of Spanish terms, only one of which was spelled<br />\nzorrectly. Reference to President Eisenhower as \"Milty\"<br />\nwas unparalleled in its wit. We rejoiced as the bird<br />\nbloated its feathered breast, thus announcing that this<br />\nissue was \"dirtier\" than ever. But we couldn't unearth<br />\none speck ot dirt, other than that some superhuman steelworker ogled once at \"a pair of particularly well-formed<br />\nbreasts.\" At this we rejoice.<br />\nWe sugge-st that if the Jayword ever desires to rank<br />\nwith the most malignine of other campus' humor magazines that it reorganizes. The editors of any such publication should be competent writers and humorists. Their<br />\nbrainstorms, not solely the works of sundry creative writing students and incompetent cartoonists, should .compose<br />\nmost of the pages. Jokes should not be antiquated; serious<br />\npoetry has no place in a \"slightly bigger, tougher and<br />\ndirtier Jayword\"; articles such as \"JAYWORD AWARDS<br />\nFOR OUTSTANDING ACHIEVEMENT\" are overworked<br />\nin high school weeklies.<br />\nTf you want to be dirty, be dirty.

(Here) there is no<br />\nwaste of human energy, no duplication.\"<br />\nProfessor Nowinski<br />\nexplained to your reporter that<br />\nin Polish universities it is unheard of to mix mechanical engineers with physics majors or<br />\nmath majors in the same classroom. Each one attends a special course geared for his eventual job. Contrasted with this is<br />\nthe U.

There is plenty of food<br />\nand a variety of food.\" Professor<br />\nNowinski wondered how it was<br />\npossible for the U. S. to be so<br />\nstrong industrially and<br />\nalso<br />\nhave such an abundance and<br />\nvariety of food.<br />\nAs far as the Professor's work<br />\nis concerned, he is quite interested in scientific research, perhaps more than teaching. Though<br />\nhe does want to lecture, he feels,<br />\nin his own words, that \"the centroid of my activities here be put<br />\non research work.\"<br /><br />\nImpressions of Faculty<br />\nWhen asked about his impressions of the faculty here,<br />\nProfessor Nowinski was happy to<br />\nsay that the level of his colleagues is very high. Carefully<br />\nwording his phrases, he added<br />\nthat \"The infiltration of new<br />\ntrends and programs in science<br />\nis much quicker (here) than<br />\nanywhere else. Its connections<br />\nwith life and practice\" said the<br />\nProfessor, \"are very vivid.\"<br /><br />\nYes, behind that door with the<br />\nwhite plaque in Maryland ,Hall<br />\nis a very happy man.

In 1644, Poguelin,<br /><br />\nFor his topic, Professor Downer chose \"The Comic Mask of<br />\nMoliere.\" A sparse, and often<br />\ncrowd<br />\nbewildered<br />\nadmittedly<br />\nheard the speaker disqualify himself at the very outset of his talk<br />\nfrom being a Moliere \"specialist\".<br />\nDr. Downer chose to speak about<br />\nthe history and theory of comedy, including the so-called<br />\n'Pure comedy\" of Moliere, which<br />\nis a more subtle art form than<br />\ncomedy which moralizes. Many<br />\nmembers of the audience who<br />\nhad expected him to devote more<br />\ntime to considering Moliere, the<br />\nman, were quite dismayed.<br /><br />\nfor no apparent reason, changed<br />\nhis name to Moliere, and started<br />\na repertory company of his own<br />\nwhich he modestly termed \"The<br />\nIllustrious Theatre.\" His performances of French farce Were<br />\nheavily influenced by Italy's<br />\nCommedia dell' Arte, which demanded that the actors manufacture complete dialogue and<br />\naction, armed by the playwright<br />\nwith only the bare outlines of a<br />\nsituation.<br /><br />\nDowner called the comic mask,<br />\n. .. the eternal re-expression<br />\nof human self.-interest.\" The<br />\naudience at a comedy watches in<br />\na somewhat detached manner<br />\nthe antics of the characters portrayed on stage. He does not associate their boorishness with<br />\nhis own (or certainly does not<br />\nadmit any such association openly).
