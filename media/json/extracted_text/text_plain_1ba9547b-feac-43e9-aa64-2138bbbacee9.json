There were fourteen of us on the<br />\ntrail going in, and frequently at night<br />\nwhen seated around a big camp fire,<br />\nsome one would ask me for a pipeful<br />\nof Edgeworth.

I told him what<br />\nhappened to my Edgeworth\u2014that I<br />\nwas just dying for a smoke, and he<br />\nunderstood right away. He said,<br />\n\"Boy, Edgeworth is mighty scarce in<br />\nthese parts, but I reckon I can spare<br />\nwhat's left of that can.
