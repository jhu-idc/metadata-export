XXI, NO. 10.<br />\n<br />\nRtm3<br />\nr<br />\n<br />\nBALTIMORE, MD., DECEMBER 11, 1916.<br />\n<br />\nThe annual football clash staged<br />\nat Homewood'on Saturday between the freshmen and sophomores was won by the Class of<br />\n1919 by the close score of 7 to 6,<br />\nafter an exciting contest which<br />\nafforded much amusement for the<br />\nspectators, due to a very slippery<br />\nfield, a high wind and a watersoaked ball that made fumbles<br />\nthe rule rather than the exception.<br />\nBetween the halves and after<br />\nthe game, there was held the class<br />\nrush, and when final count was<br />\ntaken it was found that the coveted banner was about evenly<br />\ndistributed between the classes.<br />\nThe game was very hotly contested, as indicated by the closeness of the score. However, the<br />\ncondition of the field made good<br />\nfootball impossible. Fumbles and<br />\nerrors of every kind and description were made by both teams,<br />\nwhich, from the standpoint of the<br />\nspectators, added greatly to the<br />\nenthusiasm of the affair.<br />\nNeither team scored in the first<br />\nhalf. The ball went up and down<br />\nthe field with neither team able to<br />\ngain consistently on its opponent. The sophomores covered<br />\nmore ground than the freshmen<br />\nin this half, but the Class of 1920<br />\nprevented their opponents from<br />\nscoring by their ability to recover<br />\nfumbles. Several times it seemed<br />\nthat the Class of 1919 would<br />\nscore, but at the crucial moment<br />\nthe team fumbled or made a bad<br />\npass that was nabbed up by the<br />\nfreshmen.<br />\nAll the scoring of the game was<br />\nmade in the third quarter. The<br />\nsophomores were the first to draw<br />\nblood, soon after the opening of<br />\nthe period. On the kick-off, the<br />\nsophomores recovered the ball on<br />\na fumble on their opponent's 35yard line and in record time, by<br />\nline plunges, had the ball on their<br />\nopponent's 2-yard line, from where<br />\nCox took the ball over for a<br />\ntouchdown. Schmidt kicked goal.<br />\nNot to be outdone, the freshmen came back quickly. After<br />\nthe kick-off and an exchange of<br />\npunts, in which the Class of 1920<br />\nprofited by several costly fumbles made by the sophs, Cashell<br />\nplowed through right tackle for<br />\na touchdown. Wood failed at<br />\ngoal. Neither side was able to<br />\nscore again during the remainder<br />\nof the contest.<br />\nThe class rush was staged in two<br />\nparts.

McCabe, assistant<br />\nprofessor of economics at Princeton University, have recently published a bdok on \"Mediation, Investigation and Arbitration in Industrial Disputes.\" This book is<br />\nbased on the work done in 1915<br />\nby Professor Barnett and Professor McCabe for the Government<br />\nCommission on Industrial Relations. The authors decided to<br />\npublish their views on the subject<br />\nindependently of the report of the<br />\ncommission.<br />\nCoining at a time when the<br />\neyes of the country are turned on<br />\nthe settling of disputes between<br />\nrailroad employers and employees,<br />\nthis study on the possibilities of<br />\nmediation of differences arising<br />\nbetween capital and labor is particularly significant. The authors<br />\ndiscuss mediation, investigation<br />\nand arbitration in industrial disputes both as a State and a National issue; confining themselves,<br />\nhowever, to the problems in the<br />\nUnited States, and not applying<br />\ntheir ideas to other countries.<br />\nIn the book the existing laws<br />\non mediation and arbitration are<br />\nthoroughly reviewed, and their results, both good and bad, are<br />\nnoted. After a complete resume<br />\nof the problems involved, plans<br />\nare submitted by the writers for<br />\na new system of control of industrial disputes. In the proposed<br />\nplans the best features of present<br />\nlaws are included, and the inefficiencies of the existing methods<br />\nare guarded against.<br />\nThe plans call for a chief mediator and two assistant mediators<br />\nin each State. In special cases a<br />\nState board of arbitration and a<br />\nState board of mediation and investigation are to be also provided.<br />\nThe duties of each division are<br />\ncarefully mapped out and detailed<br />\nplans given for the handling of<br />\nthe various labor disputes within<br />\nthe State.<br />\nThe plans for the nation as a<br />\nwhole include a mediation commission appointed by the President, and an industrial council,<br />\nmade up of representatives of the<br />\nten leading employers'associations<br />\nand the ten leading employees' organizations in the country.<br />\nThe whole book is remarkable<br />\nfor the clearness of concept and<br />\nthe lucidity of treatment with<br />\nwhich all the aspects of the involved question of mediation are<br />\ndiscussed.<br />\nAt Colgate University the honor<br />\nsystem now applies to chapel cuts.<br />\nThe students are placed on their<br />\nhonor to report over-cuts to the<br />\ndean's office.<br />\n<br />\nJohns Hopkins Press<br />\nI.\u2014American Journal of Mathematics.<br />\nF.

Thorn.4en, '19.<br />\nBALTIMORE, MD., DEC. 11, 1916.<br />\nRelief for the War Prisoners.<br />\n<br />\nIt is hard\u2014almost impossible<br />\n\u2014for the average college man,<br />\npursuing his routine life, enjoying his accustomed pleasures, to<br />\nrealize that in Europe 'millions<br />\nof men not one whit different<br />\nfrom himself are fighting, suffering and dying. The thing is so<br />\nmonstrous, so volcanic, that the<br />\nfirst crash of horror has gone;<br />\nthe war, to most of us, has become a vague abnormality, talked<br />\nof in terms of defeats and victories\u2014infinitely remote. Realization can come only in sudden<br />\ngusts\u2014gusts sweeping the country from end to end\u2014resulting in<br />\na riotousness of giving of which<br />\nthe world has never seen a parallel. Those gusts represent a<br />\nsudden awakening, a passionate<br />\ndesire to help,in the puny way that<br />\nwe can help, a struggling humanity. Such was the movement<br />\nwhich resulted in the sending of<br />\ntens of millions to homeless Belgium ; such was the movement<br />\nwhich sent thousands of young<br />\nAmericans to Europe to serve in<br />\nambulance corps; such is the<br />\nmovement which today becomes a<br />\npersonal appeal to every Hopkins<br />\nman.<br />\nThe condition of the prisoners<br />\nconfined in European war camps<br />\nhas been partly described elsewhere in this issue; it has not been<br />\nfully described; some of the most<br />\n<br />\nhorrible of the details have been<br />\nwithheld. Yet, in times such as<br />\nthese the most vivid of words are<br />\npowerless to those who have not<br />\nseen with their own eyes the conception of the misery; the loathsomeness, the racking, mind-destroying monotony of those camps<br />\nis beyond all comprehension.<br />\nOne thing alone is clear. To<br />\nthe men of the colleges and universities of America has come a<br />\ngreat opportunity; an opportunity, by their own individual efforts, to ameliorate the condition<br />\nof a body of men which represents<br />\nin its midst every class of the social order\u2014the laborer and the<br />\nstudent.<br />\nThis should be more than a<br />\ngrubbing appeal or an unwilling,<br />\nlistless contribution. The sum to<br />\nbe donated by Hopkins should be<br />\na sum given voluntarily\u2014gladly\u2014<br />\nfor the performance of a great<br />\nwork. It is not a matter of going<br />\nthrough with an obvious duty;<br />\nthe thing is far bigger than that.<br />\nIt is a matter of every man realizing that here he can help, here<br />\nhe can do his part, however small<br />\n\u2014realizing it through the medium<br />\nof personal sacrifice.<br />\nThe Next step.<br />\nThe most noticeable feature of<br />\nthe present football situation is<br />\nthe fact that no one knows exactly what that situation is. There<br />\nis no clear-cut issue, no sharp defining of attitude. It is not exactly a question of whether we<br />\nwant undergraduate football or<br />\nnot, because a good many of those<br />\nopposed to the present system are<br />\nalso opposed to any system which<br />\nwould eliminate from participation in Hopkins athletics the not<br />\ninconsiderable class of graduates<br />\nwho come out for teams for the<br />\nsole reason that they Are personally and loyally interested. Nor<br />\nis the present agitation by any<br />\nmeans a thoughtless reaction to<br />\nan unsuccessful season. The dissatisfaction goes deeper than<br />\nthat; it represents ideals which<br />\nhave been stirring within the University since its conception, and<br />\nwhich ultimately are bound to be<br />\nrealized. In the minds of some,<br />\nthat ultimate goal is still distant; in the minds of others, it<br />\nis here. Meanwhile, the greatest<br />\ndanger of all is that the discussion will not be definitely settled.<br />\nTo THE NEWS-LETTER, the whole<br />\nquestion is this: What policy is<br />\nbest for the Hopkins football<br />\nteam to pursue? If the best poli-<br />\n<br />\ncy is one of strictly undergraduate football, well and good. If it<br />\nis, a four-year rule, well and good.<br />\nIf -it is the present system of recruiting a team by the grace of<br />\nProvidence, well and good. But,<br />\nin the name of all logic and common sense, let us know in which<br />\ndirection we are going. Let us<br />\nneither adopt a new system nor<br />\nadhere to an old one on the score<br />\nof general principles.<br />\nThere are four parties vitally<br />\ninterested in the football question, each of whom has a perspective of its own. They are the<br />\nundergraduate students, the graduate students, the alumni and the<br />\nfaculty. No system can be successful until every one of those<br />\nclasses is heartily behind it. No<br />\nplan can be considered adequate<br />\nunless it takes the attitude of<br />\neach of those classes into consideration. In the heat of argument, a somewhat important fact<br />\nis occasionally forgotten\u2014namely, that the motive under which<br />\nevery Hopkins man is operating<br />\nis one of consideration of what<br />\nwill be to the best interests of<br />\nthe University as a whole.<br />\nFor that reaion, and because it<br />\n.belleves that in this direction lies<br />\nthe only sane, logical solution of<br />\nthe present crisis, THE NEWSLETTER proposes the following<br />\nplan: Let a committee be appointed by President Goodnow, on<br />\nwhich shall be representatives of<br />\nthe undergraduates, the Medical<br />\nSchool students, the Alumni Association and the faculty. Let<br />\nthat committee be instructed to<br />\nprepare a statement canvassing<br />\nthe desirability of a change in the<br />\nfootball situation, and, if it decides that such a change is necessary, stating just what the new<br />\npolicy should be. Finally, let<br />\nthat report be submitted to each<br />\nbody represented.<br />\nSuch a plan would guarantee<br />\ntwo things a thorough knowledge of the entire situation and a<br />\npossibility of definite, constructive action. Without such a plan,<br />\nnothing can be accomplished. Yet,<br />\nin the plan itself, we believe that<br />\nthere can be nothing antagonistic<br />\nto either the advocate of the present system or the advocate of undergraduate football. If the present agitation is unnecessary and<br />\nharmful, it will be so proved. If,<br />\non the other hand, undergraduate<br />\nfootball is a desirable thing, the<br />\nway will be open for its adoption.<br />\nThe committee,it is to be supposed,<br />\nwould be composed of such representative men as the president of<br />\nthe Alumni Association, the graduate manager and the president<br />\nof the Athletic Association. The<br />\nwork of such a committee would<br />\nof necessity be both thorough and<br />\nimpartial, and it would bear witness to a co-ordination in which,<br />\nunfortunately, Hopkins affairs<br />\nhave sometimes been notably lacking.<br />\n<br />\nWhy Hopkins Men Should Help.<br />\nBy AVRA E. LINDLEY,<br />\nGeneral Secretary of the Y. M. C. A.<br />\n<br />\nThe college and university men<br />\nof America are called upon to<br />\nraise $150,000 to help our suffering brothers in the warring nations of Europe. The crying need<br />\nof the five and one-half million<br />\nmen .and boys in the prison<br />\ncamps, suffering what at best<br />\nmust be great privation, and of<br />\nthe more than five million in hospitals, to say nothing of the millions in actual fighting armies, is<br />\nthe warrant for this appeal to the<br />\nmen of Johns Hopkins University.<br />\nWe do not claim that the raising of $1,000 among the Hopkins<br />\nstudents and faculty will discharge our obligation or meet our<br />\nresponsibility\u2014it is only sharing<br />\nin a meagre way. When in our<br />\nimagination we visit the thousands of prison camps, where, under the best possible circumstances, there is suffering from<br />\nloneliness, hunger, cold and sickness, we are face to face with an<br />\nindescribable condition. The intense cold weather of the third<br />\nyear of the war is upon the men<br />\nand the need of food and clothing<br />\nis overwhelming. We cannot afford to live here in a land of<br />\nplenty, with comfort and luxury,<br />\nwhile our fellow-students in Europe face death from the lack of<br />\nfood and clothing. When men<br />\nwho stand in peril of their lives<br />\non the battlefield gladly minister<br />\nto those who are in greater distress than themselves\u2014sometimes<br />\ntheir enemies\u2014the students of the<br />\nUnited States in the physical security of neutrality should not be<br />\ncontent until they have exhausted<br />\ntheir ingenuity in manifesting<br />\ntheir practical sympathy and<br />\nhelpfulness.<br />\nNo language can exaggerate the<br />\ndesperate condition of the men<br />\nand boys in the prison camps.<br />\nWe are confronted with an appeal to help to the limit of our<br />\nability.<br />\nOther college and university<br />\nstudents are sacrificing that they<br />\nmay answer this Call for service.<br />\nWe believe the men here at Hopkins are just as loyal and eager<br />\nto sacrifice for the students of<br />\nEurope as they are in any other<br />\ninstitution.<br />\nThis movement deserves the<br />\nsupport of every man in the University. All should give, and some<br />\nshould give largely.<br />\n<br />\n1.<br />\n<br />\n\fTilE JOIINS ii0PKINS NEWS-LETTER, DECEMBER 11, 1916.<br />\nTRACK COACH SCORES CRITICS<br />\n<br />\nSTUDENT ACTIVITIES BUILDING<br />\n<br />\nSTUDENT COUNCIL TO CONSIDER<br />\nENFORCEMENT OF REGULATIONS<br />\n<br />\nINTERCLASS DEBATE MARCH 3<br />\n<br />\nTO BE IN USE BY JANUARY<br />\nCoach England Speaks at Track Organization Meeting Against !dea of<br />\nUndergraduate Teams\u2014Good<br />\nSchedule Announced.<br />\n<br />\nAt the organization meeting of<br />\nthe Track team, last T,hursday<br />\nafternoon in the cage, in a strong<br />\nand stirring speech, Coach England, who has been the vital force<br />\nin determing the destinies of the<br />\ntrack team for many years, severely scored those who;..as members of the University or as outsiders, have been criticising the<br />\nHopkins teams and the Athletic<br />\nAssociatibn.

There<br />\nwere present, however, most of<br />\nthe old men and a dozen or more<br />\nfreshmen. Speeches were made by<br />\nthe team officers and several<br />\nalumni, Captain Harry Straus<br />\npresiding. Doctor Abercrombie<br />\nspoke upon the opportunities for<br />\nfellowship offered by the teams.<br />\nHe also made the announcement<br />\nthat the cage and gymnasium will<br />\nbe open every afternoon, although<br />\nup to the present time this had<br />\nbeen thought impracticable.

The schedule carries out the policy which<br />\nthe team has always adhered to,<br />\nnamely, that it is better to play<br />\nteams representing institutions of<br />\nour own standards, even if they<br />\ndefeat us, than to win continually<br />\nfrom opponents of lesser importance.<br />\n<br />\n5<br />\n<br />\nChange in Time of Examinations Necessitates Later Date for Annual SeniorJunior Contest Subject Soon<br />\nto Be Announced.<br />\n<br />\nAt a meeting held last Friday,<br />\nthe Debating Council fixed the<br />\ndate for the annual senior-junior<br />\ndebate and Adams recital contest<br />\nfor March 3.<br />\nIt had been a question in the<br />\ncouncil for some time whether it<br />\nwas advisable to hold the debate<br />\n\u2022 before or after the mid-year examinations. The contest was held<br />\nlast year on January 28, but<br />\nowing to the change in the examination system, some alteration<br />\nin date for this season was necessary. The council plans to have<br />\nthe juniors and seniors debate the<br />\nsame subject as that to be used<br />\nlater in the 'Varsity debates, but<br />\nowing to the delay in the reformation of the Debating Triangle with Virginia and North<br />\nCarolina, has not as yet been able<br />\nto announce what that subject<br />\nwill -be. - For this reason, it was<br />\njudged that the time available before midyears was inSufficient for<br />\nsuitable preparation.<br />\nThe council expects to hold tryouts for the two teams some time<br />\nbefore the Christmas holidays. By<br />\nthat time, it is hoped, the subject<br />\nfor the Triangle\u2014which is to be<br />\ncontinued, with or 'without Virgin ifl\u2014will have been selected.<br />\nThe debaters will thus be able to<br />\nspend the first part of January in<br />\nworking up the material for their<br />\n:iebate, and the last three weeks<br />\nof February in developing their<br />\nspeeches.<br />\n<br />\nOn account of the laxity, and in<br />\nsome cases utter disregard, of the<br />\nfreshmen in obeying the freshmen<br />\nregulations the Student Council<br />\nexpects to call a meeting of the<br />\nSenior, Junior and Sophomore<br />\ncommittees to consider, if necessary, drastic measures for their<br />\nenforcement.<br />\nIt has been, noticeable that<br />\nmany first-year men have ceased<br />\nto wear their distinctive ties and<br />\nhats and black socks; also that<br />\nthey are using forbidden short<br />\ncuts. As a result, considerable<br />\ncriticism has been made, and unless a complete change is soon apparent in the freshmen's attitude<br />\ntoward the regulations, it is<br />\nanticipated that more stringent<br />\nmeans of enforcement will have<br />\nto be considered.<br />\nSargent '19\u2014Is Helen an athletic girl?<br />\nSargent '18\u2014Well, rather; she<br />\nthrew over one of the tackles on<br />\nthe Yale team.\u2014Harvard Lampoon.<br />\nThe Adams Medal Contest,<br />\nwhich is always held at the same<br />\ntime as the senior-junior debate,<br />\nis restricted to members of the<br />\nsophomore class.

The schools are divided into three separate groups,<br />\nwith the primary aim of aiding<br />\nteachers, business men and technical workers, but students registered in any one department are<br />\nnot restricted in their subjects<br />\nand are allowed to take courses<br />\nnot in their group.<br />\nTwo new courses were opened<br />\nlast week by Drs. Pfund and Hulburt in elementary physics and<br />\nmathematics, respectively, after it<br />\nwas found that many men had undertaken the science courses without a knowledge of the fundamental principles underlying them.<br />\nThe instruction will necessarily<br />\nbe of an elementary character,<br />\nbut will depend to a certain extent upon the needs of the individual student. It is planned to<br />\nfurther develop the college courses<br />\nfor technical workers, so that<br />\nsatisfactory work in them may be<br />\ncredited towards a degree.<br />\nThe approximate attendance in<br />\nall the schools is as follows: 07 in<br />\nchemistry, 439 in college courses<br />\nfor teachers, 482 in business economics courses, and 170 in technical courses.<br />\nThis creditable showing for the<br />\nfirst two months of the existence<br />\nof the schools is due to the fact<br />\nthat several business and industrial firms in and about the city<br />\nhave made special provisions for<br />\ntheir employees to attend the<br />\nnight schools by paying in whole<br />\nor in part or advancing the tuition, and by allowing their employees to leave an hour or half<br />\nan hour before closing time.

It has caused the other<br />\nteams to look to their own weaknesses, and a general sprucing up<br />\nall around in spirit and aggressiveness has been a direct result.<br />\nAnd all this came from blaming<br />\nthe football team when the football team was not to blame.<br />\nAs to the situation here, although it is indeed deplorable, the<br />\nfootball team is not the cause.<br />\nThis team is not the speck on the<br />\napple. It is but the flagrant and<br />\nvisible result of a rotten core.<br />\nThe criticisms and suggestions<br />\nwhich have so far appeared have<br />\nin the main dealt with football,<br />\nwhereas the trouble lies higher<br />\nup. The trouble, unfortunately,<br />\nis not with the men, nor the<br />\nspirit, but with the method of<br />\ngoverning and training these men<br />\nand our athletics in general.<br />\nI am not referring to Corner,<br />\nor to Sutton, or to the other members of the Athletic Board, or to<br />\nthe coaches. All of these men are<br />\nconscientiously and ably fulfilling their functions. They can do<br />\nno more than they are doing under the present policy. They<br />\nshould in fact be congratulated<br />\non doing so well. It is not the<br />\nmen\u2014it is the system. Hopkins,<br />\nlike every other up-to-the-minute<br />\ncollege not of the 22-calibre type,<br />\nneeds a man at the head of a<br />\nradical, intelligent organization<br />\nwho knows his business, and is<br />\nable to meet men, give them good<br />\nadvice, clear-sighted supervision,<br />\nand what is just as important,<br />\nall of his time. And while Hopkins needs such a man and such a<br />\nsystem, she has been extremely<br />\nslow in adopting them. Harvard<br />\nhas Sargent, a forceful, capable<br />\nman, who has\u2022 studied conditions<br />\nat Cambridge and is in a position<br />\nto direct them to advantage. Virginia has Lambeth, and Lambeth<br />\nhas made Virginia. Before he<br />\ncame, athletics there were slipshod, uncertain, and in a general<br />\nslump, with stock at about 100<br />\nbelow par. Since his installation<br />\nVirginia's teams are met with<br />\ndeep respect and are usually winning ones. Lambeth has put them<br />\non their feet and he has made athletics there.<br />\n<br />\nWe need such a man! We need<br />\na man who can follow conditions<br />\nhere, give advice to, our men, direct athletics, supervise the coaching, training and management of<br />\nour teams; who can meet our fellows man to man, tell them what<br />\nthey ought to know, keep them<br />\non the job while they should be<br />\non it, and take them off at the<br />\nfirst signs of disability or staleness. We need a man who can be<br />\non the job all day long, who can<br />\nlook after equipment and the<br />\ntrack and playing fields, and the<br />\nconditioning of these latter. A<br />\nman who knows athletics and athletes, and the conditions surroudding both.<br />\nSuch men are available and it<br />\nis up to us to get one. We want<br />\nan up-to-the-minute wide-awake<br />\nAmerican to take Charge of our<br />\nathletics and until we get one<br />\nour athletics will never be above<br />\n\"fair to middlin',\" and they'll be<br />\nlucky to stay there. It's not our<br />\nfellows, it's not our coaches, and<br />\nit's not our graduate managers<br />\nthat are responsible for our decrepit athletic condition; but it is<br />\nthe system under which they try<br />\nto operate, and it is the lack of a<br />\ndefinite, systematized, on-the-job<br />\nhead\u2014a head with brains on the<br />\ninside and eyes on the outside,<br />\nand lots, of both.

It was in<br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER for October 30<br />\n\u2014just after (Air defeat by George<br />\nWashington University, which followed in the wake of Gettysburg's<br />\ntriumph \u2014 that the \"Would-Be<br />\nRooter\" was aroused to cry out,<br />\n\"Our whole policy is at fault.\"<br />\nAnd now, after our final crushing defeat, this cry is again taken<br />\nup and echoed on all sides amid<br />\na chorus of suggestions for bet-<br />\n<br />\n6<br />\n<br />\nEraith Clams<br />\n<br />\noririg<br />\nVrattb<br />\nThin-Its<br />\n<br />\n11<br />\n<br />\nname with a<br />\nworld of meaning<br />\nto college men.<br />\n<br />\nHub<br />\nBALTIMORE, CHARLES AND FAYETTE<br />\n<br />\n1<br />\nF some folks changed their<br />\nown temp'ements they'd<br />\nbe better satisfied with those<br />\nof their neighbors'.<br />\nneighborly idea\u2014pass<br />\nyour tin of VELVET.<br />\n<br />\nA<br />\n<br />\nimemirmt<br />\nthe unhappy conditions.<br />\nBut is it with a clear insight into<br />\nthe situation that so much of the<br />\nblame for our defeats is heaped<br />\nupon this one phase of the question?<br />\nLet us see why it is that we do<br />\nnot have undergraduate football<br />\nnow, when nearly everyone agrees<br />\nthat in time it is going to be the<br />\nbest thing for Hopkins to adopt<br />\nsuch a policy. There are two primary causes for the weakness of<br />\nour football teams. The first is<br />\nthe lack of daylight practice. A<br />\nmid-season article in one of the<br />\nBaltimore papers described a<br />\nPrinceton practice as follows:<br />\n\"Coach Rush put the team<br />\nthrough a good three-hour practice this afternoon. In fact, so<br />\nlong did the workout last that it<br />\nwas almost dark when the players returned to the dressingroom.\" And Hopkins never gets<br />\nstarted until (lark! We have to<br />\nhave ready-made material. The<br />\nsecond big cause of our weakness<br />\ntering<br />\n<br />\nlies in the fact that such a large<br />\npercentage of the students have<br />\nlittle or no real interest in our<br />\nathletic teams.<br />\nSomeone suggests that this is<br />\ndue to the fact that the graduates<br />\nare supporting the teams, but the<br />\nreal cause lies deeper than this.<br />\nIt is embedded in our very Hopkins atmosphere. To the class of<br />\nstudents of whom Wd are speaking, Hopkins has but one phase\u2014<br />\nit is the institution in which they<br />\nare doing their work. Socially,<br />\nsentimentally, athletically, and in<br />\nthe realm of recreation in general,<br />\nit means nothing to them. These<br />\nwants are supplied by other agencies throughout the city.<br />\nIn view of these two great<br />\nstumbling blocks to the success<br />\nof our teams, those who have been<br />\ngiving their heart and soul to<br />\nkeeping Hopkins spirit alive for<br />\nso many years have had to call<br />\nupon all tile legitimate resources<br />\nat their command from which to<br />\nbuild teams. Now the great<br />\n<br />\n\fTHE JOHNS HOPKINS NEWS-LETTER, DECEMBER 11, 1916.<br />\nHomewood vision looms up, which<br />\nis to revolutionize Hopkins life<br />\nand spirit. The time is coming,<br />\nwe hope, when the two great<br />\nstumbling blocks will be removed.<br />\nWith the coming of dormitories<br />\nand the increase of out-of-town<br />\nstudents, both daylight practice<br />\nand large squads for every team<br />\nought to be made possible. But<br />\nlet us not make the mistake of<br />\n\"counting the chickens before<br />\nthey are hatched.\" We must continue our uphill struggle a few<br />\nyears more,. using..every legitimate .means. within our reach to<br />\nmake our teams as efficient and<br />\nwell-supported as possible, and as<br />\nworthy as their predecessors of<br />\nbearing and defending the name<br />\nof Hopkins.<br />\nTo summarize, the question of<br />\nundergradqate. teams is only a<br />\nside issue in the struggle toward<br />\nimproving our team. Our big<br />\nfight must_ be. made for daylight<br />\npractice, and a more centralized<br />\nand unified undergraduate body.<br />\nWhen ;these shall. have been obtained, we will be no longer making a desperate struggle for life,<br />\nand our ideal of undergraduate<br />\nteams will have become as expedient as it is praiseworthy.<br />\nF. P. HALL.<br />\nDecember 9, 1916.<br />\nWants Only One Exam a Day.\u2022<br />\n<br />\nTo the Editor of Tug NEWS-LETTER:<br />\nSir\u2014Football is not the only<br />\nthing at Hopkins. There are examinations also, and they are<br />\ndue to arrive after six more weeks<br />\nof scholastic work. For the<br />\nchange in examinations which I<br />\nwish to suggest, ample time must<br />\nbe allowed; therefore, I shall air<br />\nmy views at the present time.<br />\nThe February examinations are<br />\nto be \"final examinations\" in that<br />\nthey will dispose of all the work<br />\nwe shall have finished up to that<br />\ntime; we shall not be examined<br />\non this first term's work in June,<br />\nI understand. It stands to reason, then, that the February examinations will be of the same<br />\nduration as the \"finals\", that is,<br />\nthree hours each. Now, in past<br />\nyears, I have found it a severe<br />\nphysical strain to take two threehour examinations in one day and<br />\nthen come home and study for<br />\ntwo more which are to be taken<br />\nthe following day. Under conditions like these, It is next to impossible to do oneself justice,<br />\neither as regards taking the examination or preparing for it.<br />\nAnd so such examinations are not<br />\na fair test of the student's knowledge of his subject.<br />\nMy proposal is that no two<br />\nthree-hour examinations be given<br />\nto one student on the same day.<br />\nThe carrying out of this plan<br />\nshould be easy, as in past years<br />\nmost undergraduates have had<br />\nno exams on Thursday or Friday<br />\nof examination week. By moving<br />\nsome tests which formerly came<br />\nearly in the week to these days,<br />\nmost of the difficulties of crowd-<br />\n<br />\nTWO PROFESSORS TO BE LOST<br />\nDoctors Armstrong and Marden, of the<br />\nDepartment of Romance, Have Both<br />\nAccepted Positions at Princeton University.<br />\n<br />\nEdward Cooke Armstrong, Ph.<br />\nD., and Charles Carroll Marden,<br />\nPh.

Doctor Armstrong is to have<br />\ncharge of the graduate work in<br />\nthe French language in that institution, while Doctor Marden has<br />\nbeen appointed to fill the recently<br />\ncreated Ford professorship of<br />\nSpanish.<br />\nDoctor Armstrong is a graduate of Randolph-Macon College,<br />\nwhere he received his A.

According to the<br />\nPrinceton Alumni Magazine, \"No<br />\nFrench scholar of his age has<br />\nplayed a more prominent part in<br />\nthe training of young men for the<br />\ndoctorate in French, or has insisted on a higher standard of<br />\nability or accomplishment.

However, the<br />\ncondition of the field made good<br />\nfootball impossible. Fumbles and<br />\nerrors of every kind and description were made by both teams,<br />\nwhich, from the standpoint of the<br />\nspectators, added greatly to the<br />\nenthusiasm of the affair.<br />\nNeither team scored in the first<br />\nhalf. The ball went up and down<br />\nthe field with neither team able to<br />\ngain consistently on its opponent. The sophomores covered<br />\nmore ground than the freshmen<br />\nin this half, but the Class of 1920<br />\nprevented their opponents from<br />\nscoring by their ability to recover<br />\nfumbles. Several times it seemed<br />\nthat the Class of 1919 would<br />\nscore, but at the crucial moment<br />\nthe team fumbled or made a bad<br />\npass that was nabbed up by the<br />\nfreshmen.<br />\nAll the scoring of the game was<br />\nmade in the third quarter. The<br />\nsophomores were the first to draw<br />\nblood, soon after the opening of<br />\nthe period. On the kick-off, the<br />\nsophomores recovered the ball on<br />\na fumble on their opponent's 35yard line and in record time, by<br />\nline plunges, had the ball on their<br />\nopponent's 2-yard line, from where<br />\nCox took the ball over for a<br />\ntouchdown. Schmidt kicked goal.<br />\nNot to be outdone, the freshmen came back quickly.

Barnett, professor of statistics at Johns Hopkins,<br />\nand Dr. I). A. McCabe, assistant<br />\nprofessor of economics at Princeton University, have recently published a bdok on \"Mediation, Investigation and Arbitration in Industrial Disputes.\" This book is<br />\nbased on the work done in 1915<br />\nby Professor Barnett and Professor McCabe for the Government<br />\nCommission on Industrial Relations. The authors decided to<br />\npublish their views on the subject<br />\nindependently of the report of the<br />\ncommission.<br />\nCoining at a time when the<br />\neyes of the country are turned on<br />\nthe settling of disputes between<br />\nrailroad employers and employees,<br />\nthis study on the possibilities of<br />\nmediation of differences arising<br />\nbetween capital and labor is particularly significant. The authors<br />\ndiscuss mediation, investigation<br />\nand arbitration in industrial disputes both as a State and a National issue; confining themselves,<br />\nhowever, to the problems in the<br />\nUnited States, and not applying<br />\ntheir ideas to other countries.<br />\nIn the book the existing laws<br />\non mediation and arbitration are<br />\nthoroughly reviewed, and their results, both good and bad, are<br />\nnoted. After a complete resume<br />\nof the problems involved, plans<br />\nare submitted by the writers for<br />\na new system of control of industrial disputes. In the proposed<br />\nplans the best features of present<br />\nlaws are included, and the inefficiencies of the existing methods<br />\nare guarded against.<br />\nThe plans call for a chief mediator and two assistant mediators<br />\nin each State. In special cases a<br />\nState board of arbitration and a<br />\nState board of mediation and investigation are to be also provided.<br />\nThe duties of each division are<br />\ncarefully mapped out and detailed<br />\nplans given for the handling of<br />\nthe various labor disputes within<br />\nthe State.<br />\nThe plans for the nation as a<br />\nwhole include a mediation commission appointed by the President, and an industrial council,<br />\nmade up of representatives of the<br />\nten leading employers'associations<br />\nand the ten leading employees' organizations in the country.<br />\nThe whole book is remarkable<br />\nfor the clearness of concept and<br />\nthe lucidity of treatment with<br />\nwhich all the aspects of the involved question of mediation are<br />\ndiscussed.<br />\nAt Colgate University the honor<br />\nsystem now applies to chapel cuts.<br />\nThe students are placed on their<br />\nhonor to report over-cuts to the<br />\ndean's office.<br /><br />\nJohns Hopkins Press<br />\nI.\u2014American Journal of Mathematics.<br />\nF.

It was explained how, in<br />\nNew York, every possible precaution is taken to prevent contamination while the milk is being<br />\nhandled in its delivery to the customers.<br />\nAccording to Doctor Park, milk<br />\nis one of the most nutritious<br />\nof the dairy products, and on this<br />\nbasis also far surpasses many<br />\nother foods.

Those gusts represent a<br />\nsudden awakening, a passionate<br />\ndesire to help,in the puny way that<br />\nwe can help, a struggling humanity. Such was the movement<br />\nwhich resulted in the sending of<br />\ntens of millions to homeless Belgium ; such was the movement<br />\nwhich sent thousands of young<br />\nAmericans to Europe to serve in<br />\nambulance corps; such is the<br />\nmovement which today becomes a<br />\npersonal appeal to every Hopkins<br />\nman.<br />\nThe condition of the prisoners<br />\nconfined in European war camps<br />\nhas been partly described elsewhere in this issue; it has not been<br />\nfully described; some of the most<br /><br />\nhorrible of the details have been<br />\nwithheld. Yet, in times such as<br />\nthese the most vivid of words are<br />\npowerless to those who have not<br />\nseen with their own eyes the conception of the misery; the loathsomeness, the racking, mind-destroying monotony of those camps<br />\nis beyond all comprehension.<br />\nOne thing alone is clear.

The sum to<br />\nbe donated by Hopkins should be<br />\na sum given voluntarily\u2014gladly\u2014<br />\nfor the performance of a great<br />\nwork. It is not a matter of going<br />\nthrough with an obvious duty;<br />\nthe thing is far bigger than that.<br />\nIt is a matter of every man realizing that here he can help, here<br />\nhe can do his part, however small<br />\n\u2014realizing it through the medium<br />\nof personal sacrifice.<br />\nThe Next step.<br />\nThe most noticeable feature of<br />\nthe present football situation is<br />\nthe fact that no one knows exactly what that situation is. There<br />\nis no clear-cut issue, no sharp defining of attitude. It is not exactly a question of whether we<br />\nwant undergraduate football or<br />\nnot, because a good many of those<br />\nopposed to the present system are<br />\nalso opposed to any system which<br />\nwould eliminate from participation in Hopkins athletics the not<br />\ninconsiderable class of graduates<br />\nwho come out for teams for the<br />\nsole reason that they Are personally and loyally interested. Nor<br />\nis the present agitation by any<br />\nmeans a thoughtless reaction to<br />\nan unsuccessful season. The dissatisfaction goes deeper than<br />\nthat; it represents ideals which<br />\nhave been stirring within the University since its conception, and<br />\nwhich ultimately are bound to be<br />\nrealized. In the minds of some,<br />\nthat ultimate goal is still distant; in the minds of others, it<br />\nis here. Meanwhile, the greatest<br />\ndanger of all is that the discussion will not be definitely settled.<br />\nTo THE NEWS-LETTER, the whole<br />\nquestion is this: What policy is<br />\nbest for the Hopkins football<br />\nteam to pursue? If the best poli-<br /><br />\ncy is one of strictly undergraduate football, well and good. If it<br />\nis, a four-year rule, well and good.<br />\nIf -it is the present system of recruiting a team by the grace of<br />\nProvidence, well and good. But,<br />\nin the name of all logic and common sense, let us know in which<br />\ndirection we are going. Let us<br />\nneither adopt a new system nor<br />\nadhere to an old one on the score<br />\nof general principles.<br />\nThere are four parties vitally<br />\ninterested in the football question, each of whom has a perspective of its own. They are the<br />\nundergraduate students, the graduate students, the alumni and the<br />\nfaculty. No system can be successful until every one of those<br />\nclasses is heartily behind it. No<br />\nplan can be considered adequate<br />\nunless it takes the attitude of<br />\neach of those classes into consideration. In the heat of argument, a somewhat important fact<br />\nis occasionally forgotten\u2014namely, that the motive under which<br />\nevery Hopkins man is operating<br />\nis one of consideration of what<br />\nwill be to the best interests of<br />\nthe University as a whole.<br />\nFor that reaion, and because it<br />\n.belleves that in this direction lies<br />\nthe only sane, logical solution of<br />\nthe present crisis, THE NEWSLETTER proposes the following<br />\nplan: Let a committee be appointed by President Goodnow, on<br />\nwhich shall be representatives of<br />\nthe undergraduates, the Medical<br />\nSchool students, the Alumni Association and the faculty. Let<br />\nthat committee be instructed to<br />\nprepare a statement canvassing<br />\nthe desirability of a change in the<br />\nfootball situation, and, if it decides that such a change is necessary, stating just what the new<br />\npolicy should be. Finally, let<br />\nthat report be submitted to each<br />\nbody represented.<br />\nSuch a plan would guarantee<br />\ntwo things a thorough knowledge of the entire situation and a<br />\npossibility of definite, constructive action. Without such a plan,<br />\nnothing can be accomplished. Yet,<br />\nin the plan itself, we believe that<br />\nthere can be nothing antagonistic<br />\nto either the advocate of the present system or the advocate of undergraduate football. If the present agitation is unnecessary and<br />\nharmful, it will be so proved. If,<br />\non the other hand, undergraduate<br />\nfootball is a desirable thing, the<br />\nway will be open for its adoption.<br />\nThe committee,it is to be supposed,<br />\nwould be composed of such representative men as the president of<br />\nthe Alumni Association, the graduate manager and the president<br />\nof the Athletic Association. The<br />\nwork of such a committee would<br />\nof necessity be both thorough and<br />\nimpartial, and it would bear witness to a co-ordination in which,<br />\nunfortunately, Hopkins affairs<br />\nhave sometimes been notably lacking.<br /><br />\nWhy Hopkins Men Should Help.<br />\nBy AVRA E. LINDLEY,<br />\nGeneral Secretary of the Y. M. C. A.<br /><br />\nThe college and university men<br />\nof America are called upon to<br />\nraise $150,000 to help our suffering brothers in the warring nations of Europe. The crying need<br />\nof the five and one-half million<br />\nmen .and boys in the prison<br />\ncamps, suffering what at best<br />\nmust be great privation, and of<br />\nthe more than five million in hospitals, to say nothing of the millions in actual fighting armies, is<br />\nthe warrant for this appeal to the<br />\nmen of Johns Hopkins University.<br />\nWe do not claim that the raising of $1,000 among the Hopkins<br />\nstudents and faculty will discharge our obligation or meet our<br />\nresponsibility\u2014it is only sharing<br />\nin a meagre way. When in our<br />\nimagination we visit the thousands of prison camps, where, under the best possible circumstances, there is suffering from<br />\nloneliness, hunger, cold and sickness, we are face to face with an<br />\nindescribable condition. The intense cold weather of the third<br />\nyear of the war is upon the men<br />\nand the need of food and clothing<br />\nis overwhelming. We cannot afford to live here in a land of<br />\nplenty, with comfort and luxury,<br />\nwhile our fellow-students in Europe face death from the lack of<br />\nfood and clothing. When men<br />\nwho stand in peril of their lives<br />\non the battlefield gladly minister<br />\nto those who are in greater distress than themselves\u2014sometimes<br />\ntheir enemies\u2014the students of the<br />\nUnited States in the physical security of neutrality should not be<br />\ncontent until they have exhausted<br />\ntheir ingenuity in manifesting<br />\ntheir practical sympathy and<br />\nhelpfulness.<br />\nNo language can exaggerate the<br />\ndesperate condition of the men<br />\nand boys in the prison camps.<br />\nWe are confronted with an appeal to help to the limit of our<br />\nability.<br />\nOther college and university<br />\nstudents are sacrificing that they<br />\nmay answer this Call for service.<br />\nWe believe the men here at Hopkins are just as loyal and eager<br />\nto sacrifice for the students of<br />\nEurope as they are in any other<br />\ninstitution.<br />\nThis movement deserves the<br />\nsupport of every man in the University. All should give, and some<br />\nshould give largely.<br /><br />\n1.<br /><br />\nTilE JOIINS ii0PKINS NEWS-LETTER, DECEMBER 11, 1916.<br />\nTRACK COACH SCORES CRITICS<br /><br />\nSTUDENT ACTIVITIES BUILDING<br /><br />\nSTUDENT COUNCIL TO CONSIDER<br />\nENFORCEMENT OF REGULATIONS<br /><br />\nINTERCLASS DEBATE MARCH 3<br /><br />\nTO BE IN USE BY JANUARY<br />\nCoach England Speaks at Track Organization Meeting Against !dea of<br />\nUndergraduate Teams\u2014Good<br />\nSchedule Announced.<br /><br />\nAt the organization meeting of<br />\nthe Track team, last T,hursday<br />\nafternoon in the cage, in a strong<br />\nand stirring speech, Coach England, who has been the vital force<br />\nin determing the destinies of the<br />\ntrack team for many years, severely scored those who;..as members of the University or as outsiders, have been criticising the<br />\nHopkins teams and the Athletic<br />\nAssociatibn. Mr. England *as especially positive in regard to<br />\nthose who have ventured to refer<br />\nto a Hopkins \"system.\" Denying<br />\nthe existence of any such thing as<br />\na system, he showed that the Hopkins team has fought and won its<br />\nbattles on team spirit. \"We not<br />\nonly want graduate and 'medical<br />\nstudents, as well as undergraduates, on the team,\" emphatically<br />\ndeclared the coach, \"but we expect them to come out.\" Characterizing track work, he laid great<br />\nstress on the fact that although<br />\ntrack is a sport in which everything depends upon individual<br />\nperformances, it is not the striving after personal glory, but the<br />\nteam sidrit\u2014the esprit de corps\u2014<br />\nwhich, coupled with individual<br />\nheadwork and persistency, makes<br />\nthe great team.<br />\nThe freshman and sophomore<br />\nfootball practices formed a counter attraction to the meeting, and<br />\nthis fact, together with the in<br />\nconvenience of getting to the cage,<br />\nwas no doubt responsible for the<br />\npoor showing of the two lower<br />\nclasses at the meeting. There<br />\nwere present, however, most of<br />\nthe old men and a dozen or more<br />\nfreshmen. Speeches were made by<br />\nthe team officers and several<br />\nalumni, Captain Harry Straus<br />\npresiding. Doctor Abercrombie<br />\nspoke upon the opportunities for<br />\nfellowship offered by the teams.<br />\nHe also made the announcement<br />\nthat the cage and gymnasium will<br />\nbe open every afternoon, although<br />\nup to the present time this had<br />\nbeen thought impracticable.

The basement floor will comprise three<br />\nlunchrooms, a kitchen, a storeroom and a barber shop.<br />\nThe edifice is of red brick, with<br />\nwhite trimmings, following the<br />\nscheme of the other Hopkins<br />\nbuildings.

The schedule carries out the policy which<br />\nthe team has always adhered to,<br />\nnamely, that it is better to play<br />\nteams representing institutions of<br />\nour own standards, even if they<br />\ndefeat us, than to win continually<br />\nfrom opponents of lesser importance.<br /><br />\n5<br /><br />\nChange in Time of Examinations Necessitates Later Date for Annual SeniorJunior Contest Subject Soon<br />\nto Be Announced.<br /><br />\nAt a meeting held last Friday,<br />\nthe Debating Council fixed the<br />\ndate for the annual senior-junior<br />\ndebate and Adams recital contest<br />\nfor March 3.<br />\nIt had been a question in the<br />\ncouncil for some time whether it<br />\nwas advisable to hold the debate<br />\n\u2022 before or after the mid-year examinations. The contest was held<br />\nlast year on January 28, but<br />\nowing to the change in the examination system, some alteration<br />\nin date for this season was necessary. The council plans to have<br />\nthe juniors and seniors debate the<br />\nsame subject as that to be used<br />\nlater in the 'Varsity debates, but<br />\nowing to the delay in the reformation of the Debating Triangle with Virginia and North<br />\nCarolina, has not as yet been able<br />\nto announce what that subject<br />\nwill -be. - For this reason, it was<br />\njudged that the time available before midyears was inSufficient for<br />\nsuitable preparation.<br />\nThe council expects to hold tryouts for the two teams some time<br />\nbefore the Christmas holidays. By<br />\nthat time, it is hoped, the subject<br />\nfor the Triangle\u2014which is to be<br />\ncontinued, with or 'without Virgin ifl\u2014will have been selected.<br />\nThe debaters will thus be able to<br />\nspend the first part of January in<br />\nworking up the material for their<br />\n:iebate, and the last three weeks<br />\nof February in developing their<br />\nspeeches.<br /><br />\nOn account of the laxity, and in<br />\nsome cases utter disregard, of the<br />\nfreshmen in obeying the freshmen<br />\nregulations the Student Council<br />\nexpects to call a meeting of the<br />\nSenior, Junior and Sophomore<br />\ncommittees to consider, if necessary, drastic measures for their<br />\nenforcement.<br />\nIt has been, noticeable that<br />\nmany first-year men have ceased<br />\nto wear their distinctive ties and<br />\nhats and black socks; also that<br />\nthey are using forbidden short<br />\ncuts. As a result, considerable<br />\ncriticism has been made, and unless a complete change is soon apparent in the freshmen's attitude<br />\ntoward the regulations, it is<br />\nanticipated that more stringent<br />\nmeans of enforcement will have<br />\nto be considered.<br />\nSargent '19\u2014Is Helen an athletic girl?<br />\nSargent '18\u2014Well, rather; she<br />\nthrew over one of the tackles on<br />\nthe Yale team.\u2014Harvard Lampoon.<br />\nThe Adams Medal Contest,<br />\nwhich is always held at the same<br />\ntime as the senior-junior debate,<br />\nis restricted to members of the<br />\nsophomore class.

The schools are divided into three separate groups,<br />\nwith the primary aim of aiding<br />\nteachers, business men and technical workers, but students registered in any one department are<br />\nnot restricted in their subjects<br />\nand are allowed to take courses<br />\nnot in their group.<br />\nTwo new courses were opened<br />\nlast week by Drs. Pfund and Hulburt in elementary physics and<br />\nmathematics, respectively, after it<br />\nwas found that many men had undertaken the science courses without a knowledge of the fundamental principles underlying them.<br />\nThe instruction will necessarily<br />\nbe of an elementary character,<br />\nbut will depend to a certain extent upon the needs of the individual student. It is planned to<br />\nfurther develop the college courses<br />\nfor technical workers, so that<br />\nsatisfactory work in them may be<br />\ncredited towards a degree.<br />\nThe approximate attendance in<br />\nall the schools is as follows: 07 in<br />\nchemistry, 439 in college courses<br />\nfor teachers, 482 in business economics courses, and 170 in technical courses.<br />\nThis creditable showing for the<br />\nfirst two months of the existence<br />\nof the schools is due to the fact<br />\nthat several business and industrial firms in and about the city<br />\nhave made special provisions for<br />\ntheir employees to attend the<br />\nnight schools by paying in whole<br />\nor in part or advancing the tuition, and by allowing their employees to leave an hour or half<br />\nan hour before closing time.

It has caused the other<br />\nteams to look to their own weaknesses, and a general sprucing up<br />\nall around in spirit and aggressiveness has been a direct result.<br />\nAnd all this came from blaming<br />\nthe football team when the football team was not to blame.<br />\nAs to the situation here, although it is indeed deplorable, the<br />\nfootball team is not the cause.<br />\nThis team is not the speck on the<br />\napple. It is but the flagrant and<br />\nvisible result of a rotten core.<br />\nThe criticisms and suggestions<br />\nwhich have so far appeared have<br />\nin the main dealt with football,<br />\nwhereas the trouble lies higher<br />\nup. The trouble, unfortunately,<br />\nis not with the men, nor the<br />\nspirit, but with the method of<br />\ngoverning and training these men<br />\nand our athletics in general.<br />\nI am not referring to Corner,<br />\nor to Sutton, or to the other members of the Athletic Board, or to<br />\nthe coaches. All of these men are<br />\nconscientiously and ably fulfilling their functions. They can do<br />\nno more than they are doing under the present policy. They<br />\nshould in fact be congratulated<br />\non doing so well. It is not the<br />\nmen\u2014it is the system. Hopkins,<br />\nlike every other up-to-the-minute<br />\ncollege not of the 22-calibre type,<br />\nneeds a man at the head of a<br />\nradical, intelligent organization<br />\nwho knows his business, and is<br />\nable to meet men, give them good<br />\nadvice, clear-sighted supervision,<br />\nand what is just as important,<br />\nall of his time. And while Hopkins needs such a man and such a<br />\nsystem, she has been extremely<br />\nslow in adopting them. Harvard<br />\nhas Sargent, a forceful, capable<br />\nman, who has\u2022 studied conditions<br />\nat Cambridge and is in a position<br />\nto direct them to advantage. Virginia has Lambeth, and Lambeth<br />\nhas made Virginia. Before he<br />\ncame, athletics there were slipshod, uncertain, and in a general<br />\nslump, with stock at about 100<br />\nbelow par. Since his installation<br />\nVirginia's teams are met with<br />\ndeep respect and are usually winning ones. Lambeth has put them<br />\non their feet and he has made athletics there.<br /><br />\nWe need such a man! We need<br />\na man who can follow conditions<br />\nhere, give advice to, our men, direct athletics, supervise the coaching, training and management of<br />\nour teams; who can meet our fellows man to man, tell them what<br />\nthey ought to know, keep them<br />\non the job while they should be<br />\non it, and take them off at the<br />\nfirst signs of disability or staleness. We need a man who can be<br />\non the job all day long, who can<br />\nlook after equipment and the<br />\ntrack and playing fields, and the<br />\nconditioning of these latter. A<br />\nman who knows athletics and athletes, and the conditions surroudding both.<br />\nSuch men are available and it<br />\nis up to us to get one. We want<br />\nan up-to-the-minute wide-awake<br />\nAmerican to take Charge of our<br />\nathletics and until we get one<br />\nour athletics will never be above<br />\n\"fair to middlin',\" and they'll be<br />\nlucky to stay there. It's not our<br />\nfellows, it's not our coaches, and<br />\nit's not our graduate managers<br />\nthat are responsible for our decrepit athletic condition; but it is<br />\nthe system under which they try<br />\nto operate, and it is the lack of a<br />\ndefinite, systematized, on-the-job<br />\nhead\u2014a head with brains on the<br />\ninside and eyes on the outside,<br />\nand lots, of both. We haven't<br />\nsuch a man \u2014 sad to say, we<br />\nhaven't any man\u2014and until we<br />\nget one, you can keep on making<br />\nfour-year rules and keep on barring meds and'<br />\nkeep on hiring sundry and divers coaches until Hopkins is history and history forgotten and we won't have better<br />\nteams.<br />\nSo let's get busy.

It was in<br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER for October 30<br />\n\u2014just after (Air defeat by George<br />\nWashington University, which followed in the wake of Gettysburg's<br />\ntriumph \u2014 that the \"Would-Be<br />\nRooter\" was aroused to cry out,<br />\n\"Our whole policy is at fault.\"<br />\nAnd now, after our final crushing defeat, this cry is again taken<br />\nup and echoed on all sides amid<br />\na chorus of suggestions for bet-<br /><br />\n6<br /><br />\nEraith Clams<br /><br />\noririg<br />\nVrattb<br />\nThin-Its<br /><br />\n11<br /><br />\nname with a<br />\nworld of meaning<br />\nto college men.<br /><br />\nHub<br />\nBALTIMORE, CHARLES AND FAYETTE<br /><br />\n1<br />\nF some folks changed their<br />\nown temp'ements they'd<br />\nbe better satisfied with those<br />\nof their neighbors'.<br />\nneighborly idea\u2014pass<br />\nyour tin of VELVET.<br /><br />\nA<br /><br />\nimemirmt<br />\nthe unhappy conditions.<br />\nBut is it with a clear insight into<br />\nthe situation that so much of the<br />\nblame for our defeats is heaped<br />\nupon this one phase of the question?<br />\nLet us see why it is that we do<br />\nnot have undergraduate football<br />\nnow, when nearly everyone agrees<br />\nthat in time it is going to be the<br />\nbest thing for Hopkins to adopt<br />\nsuch a policy. There are two primary causes for the weakness of<br />\nour football teams. The first is<br />\nthe lack of daylight practice. A<br />\nmid-season article in one of the<br />\nBaltimore papers described a<br />\nPrinceton practice as follows:<br />\n\"Coach Rush put the team<br />\nthrough a good three-hour practice this afternoon. In fact, so<br />\nlong did the workout last that it<br />\nwas almost dark when the players returned to the dressingroom.\" And Hopkins never gets<br />\nstarted until (lark! We have to<br />\nhave ready-made material. The<br />\nsecond big cause of our weakness<br />\ntering<br /><br />\nlies in the fact that such a large<br />\npercentage of the students have<br />\nlittle or no real interest in our<br />\nathletic teams.<br />\nSomeone suggests that this is<br />\ndue to the fact that the graduates<br />\nare supporting the teams, but the<br />\nreal cause lies deeper than this.<br />\nIt is embedded in our very Hopkins atmosphere. To the class of<br />\nstudents of whom Wd are speaking, Hopkins has but one phase\u2014<br />\nit is the institution in which they<br />\nare doing their work. Socially,<br />\nsentimentally, athletically, and in<br />\nthe realm of recreation in general,<br />\nit means nothing to them. These<br />\nwants are supplied by other agencies throughout the city.<br />\nIn view of these two great<br />\nstumbling blocks to the success<br />\nof our teams, those who have been<br />\ngiving their heart and soul to<br />\nkeeping Hopkins spirit alive for<br />\nso many years have had to call<br />\nupon all tile legitimate resources<br />\nat their command from which to<br />\nbuild teams. Now the great<br /><br />\nTHE JOHNS HOPKINS NEWS-LETTER, DECEMBER 11, 1916.<br />\nHomewood vision looms up, which<br />\nis to revolutionize Hopkins life<br />\nand spirit. The time is coming,<br />\nwe hope, when the two great<br />\nstumbling blocks will be removed.<br />\nWith the coming of dormitories<br />\nand the increase of out-of-town<br />\nstudents, both daylight practice<br />\nand large squads for every team<br />\nought to be made possible. But<br />\nlet us not make the mistake of<br />\n\"counting the chickens before<br />\nthey are hatched.\" We must continue our uphill struggle a few<br />\nyears more,. using..every legitimate .means. within our reach to<br />\nmake our teams as efficient and<br />\nwell-supported as possible, and as<br />\nworthy as their predecessors of<br />\nbearing and defending the name<br />\nof Hopkins.<br />\nTo summarize, the question of<br />\nundergradqate. teams is only a<br />\nside issue in the struggle toward<br />\nimproving our team. Our big<br />\nfight must_ be. made for daylight<br />\npractice, and a more centralized<br />\nand unified undergraduate body.<br />\nWhen ;these shall. have been obtained, we will be no longer making a desperate struggle for life,<br />\nand our ideal of undergraduate<br />\nteams will have become as expedient as it is praiseworthy.<br />\nF. P. HALL.<br />\nDecember 9, 1916.<br />\nWants Only One Exam a Day.\u2022<br /><br />\nTo the Editor of Tug NEWS-LETTER:<br />\nSir\u2014Football is not the only<br />\nthing at Hopkins. There are examinations also, and they are<br />\ndue to arrive after six more weeks<br />\nof scholastic work. For the<br />\nchange in examinations which I<br />\nwish to suggest, ample time must<br />\nbe allowed; therefore, I shall air<br />\nmy views at the present time.<br />\nThe February examinations are<br />\nto be \"final examinations\" in that<br />\nthey will dispose of all the work<br />\nwe shall have finished up to that<br />\ntime; we shall not be examined<br />\non this first term's work in June,<br />\nI understand. It stands to reason, then, that the February examinations will be of the same<br />\nduration as the \"finals\", that is,<br />\nthree hours each. Now, in past<br />\nyears, I have found it a severe<br />\nphysical strain to take two threehour examinations in one day and<br />\nthen come home and study for<br />\ntwo more which are to be taken<br />\nthe following day. Under conditions like these, It is next to impossible to do oneself justice,<br />\neither as regards taking the examination or preparing for it.<br />\nAnd so such examinations are not<br />\na fair test of the student's knowledge of his subject.<br />\nMy proposal is that no two<br />\nthree-hour examinations be given<br />\nto one student on the same day.<br />\nThe carrying out of this plan<br />\nshould be easy, as in past years<br />\nmost undergraduates have had<br />\nno exams on Thursday or Friday<br />\nof examination week. By moving<br />\nsome tests which formerly came<br />\nearly in the week to these days,<br />\nmost of the difficulties of crowd-<br /><br />\nTWO PROFESSORS TO BE LOST<br />\nDoctors Armstrong and Marden, of the<br />\nDepartment of Romance, Have Both<br />\nAccepted Positions at Princeton University.<br /><br />\nEdward Cooke Armstrong, Ph.<br />\nD., and Charles Carroll Marden,<br />\nPh.

According to the<br />\nPrinceton Alumni Magazine, \"No<br />\nFrench scholar of his age has<br />\nplayed a more prominent part in<br />\nthe training of young men for the<br />\ndoctorate in French, or has insisted on a higher standard of<br />\nability or accomplishment.
