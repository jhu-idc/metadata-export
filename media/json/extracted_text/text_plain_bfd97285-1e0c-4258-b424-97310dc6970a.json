Beginning with this lecture,<br />\nthe Noyce Peace Endowment hopes to fund<br />\na continuing program of courses *and lectures on peace.<br />\nThe Noyce Peace Endowment, under the<br />\nauspice of the Chaplain's Office, has been<br />\nrecently established and is in need of funds.<br />\nIn asking for contributions, Chaplain Gretchen van Utt noted that none of the funds<br />\nare invested in defense-related businesses<br />\nor compaines having dealing with South<br />\nAfrica.<br />\nMcCarthy stressed the need to translate<br />\ncriticism of the existing situation into action. \"We liberals have to go beyond<br />\ngroaning and whining about this Pharaoh<br />\nwho's running our country,\" he remarked. \"In our last eight years, we've been<br />\non a high because of Reagan.<br />\n\"We go out and write Congress about<br />\nthe MX missile and maybe march across<br />\nthe country and feel good about it,\" he<br />\nsaid. \"The press will try to cover it all,<br />\nand you're on the evening news. But then<br />\nit's done, and it's still the same as<br />\nbefore. .<br />\nMcCarthy's solution to the dilemma is<br />\nto \"go into the schools\" and teach. His<br />\ncareer in teaching began five years ago<br />\nwith an invitation from a local public high<br />\nschool to teach journalism. He decided to<br />\nteach about peace instead. McCarthy has<br />\ngone on to teach at the University of<br />\nMaryland, Georgetown University, and<br />\n<br />\nelsewhere.<br />\nMcCarthy believes that the first step in<br />\nachieving world peace is to make<br />\nAmerica's youth aware of the ideas of<br />\npacifism. He sees an American society<br />\npreoccupied with success and personal<br />\ngain, and not with cooperation. In his<br />\nview, the public has been conditioned to<br />\naccept war as inevitable and to condone<br />\nmass killings and destruction.<br />\n\"I've had about a thousand students,\"<br />\nhe said. \"I have found that they're hungry<br />\nfor more.\" Currently, McCarthy heads the<br />\nCenter for Teaching Peace and is an instructor in private and public high schools<br />\nin the Washington area.<br />\nCritics have accused McCarthy of nullifying his goals by accepting federal funds.<br />\n\"Many in the peace movement do not want<br />\n<br />\nto go near the system,\" he said. \"The<br />\n, grants aren't as pure as (they) like.\"<br />\nMcCarthy said he must work within the<br />\nsystem to change it. He designed his program to offer an alternative to the Pentagon's Reserve Officers' Training Corps<br />\n(ROTC). McCarthy noted that there are<br />\nfifty campuses in America offering peace<br />\nstudies as a discipline, compared to 1,200<br />\noffering ROTC, such as Hopkins.<br />\n\"They [students in ROTC] are not in<br />\nthere because they want to go shoot people in Grenada, but because it's the only<br />\nwas to make it through college.\" According to McCarthy, additional economic<br />\npressure to deny pacifism has been placed<br />\non today's student, in addition to the<br />\nfact that the Reagan administration has<br />\nattempted to cut funding for all twenty stu-<br />\n<br />\ndent loan programs.<br />\nMcCarthy believed that the force of<br />\npacifism is just as effective as the force of<br />\narms in trying to \"change what the other<br />\nperson, other country, other government<br />\nthinks.\" He stressed that pacifists defend<br />\nthemselves with the force of ideas just as<br />\nwell as the person using his fists.<br />\nOn the other hand, he remarked, \"It is<br />\nmuch easier to teach Linear Physics speaking in Arabic than the concept of nonviolence.\" Faced with numerous obstacles<br />\nto overcome, from lack of funding to the<br />\npublic's widespread ignorance, McCarthy<br />\nadmits the possibility of defeat for<br />\npacifism.<br />\nQuoting singer Joan Baez, though, he<br />\nsaid, \"Nonviolence will always be less of<br />\na flop than violence.\"<br />\n<br />\nTHE CHRONICLE<br />\n<br />\nPell Grant program short of money<br />\nCopyright 1988, The Chronicle ofHigher<br />\nEducation.

The Office of<br />\nResidential Life has considerable input<br />\nunder the present system, albeit informal. The dejure concessions to the administration in the proposal largely entail formalizing its input into the selection process.<br />\nSo what's wrong? If the students still<br />\nbasically run the show, and the program<br />\nstands to be improved by salaried positions, what's the problem?<br />\nA first instinctual reaction is that<br />\nnothing is broken, so there should be no<br />\ngreat desire to fix it. A committee<br />\nestablished last year by Dean Colombo<br />\nto examine Orientation concluded that<br />\nHopkins' program is \"top notch and<br />\n<br />\nsuccessfully addresses the concerns of<br />\nstudents in transition.\" Yet it goes on<br />\nto assert that \"providing stipends is<br />\nessential if Orientation is to continue to<br />\nattract...highly qualified student<br />\nleaders.\" The concern hardly seems<br />\njustified, unless it was the committee's<br />\nopinion that the quality of the chairmen<br />\nhas been declining.<br />\nPerhaps something is intimidating<br />\nabout formalizing the control the administration would have over the program. Granted, the proposal calls for a<br />\ntrial year, so if non-student control was<br />\noppressive, the system could be returned to its present one. But how will that<br />\nline of \"too oppressive\" be determined, and even if it is \"too oppressive\"<br />\nwould the chairmen mind, as long as the<br />\npay is good?<br />\nSomething larger looms in the<br />\nbackground of the policy change. Orientation is a student activity, regardless of<br />\nsome clear distinctions between it and<br />\nother student activities. By crossing the<br />\nline of renumerating student extracurricular work the principle of recognizing the importance of a well-rounded<br />\neducation is tarnished. More needs to<br />\nbe done here to encourage diversity of<br />\nactivity for its own value; students don't<br />\nneed the added pressure of evaluating<br />\ntheir own positions in terms of whether<br />\nor not the University deems that they are<br />\nworthy of getting paid for it.<br />\n<br />\nDon't sqwelch the Welch<br />\nat Homewood<br />\nThis week the resignation of Dean of<br />\nHomewood Schools Administration<br />\nRobert Welch was announced. Welch<br />\nsaid that he has completed the jobs he<br />\nwas hired to do, and is moving on to<br />\nfurther his career.<br />\nWelch came to Hopkins in 1985 to fill<br />\nthe newly-created position of dean of<br />\nHomewood Schools; his responsibilities<br />\nwere to focus upon admissions, financial aid, student amenities, and housing.<br />\nAdministrators within these areas would<br />\nreport directly to him.<br />\nOf the many improvements made during Welch's administration, perhaps his<br />\ngreatest contribution was his active support of the expression of student concerns on campus. A close look at the<br />\nHuman Climate Task Force Report,<br />\nreleased last fall, reflects his efforts and<br />\nachieverr-rit. That a strong student<br />\n<br />\nvoice speaks out is to his credit; that<br />\ndefinite improvements remain show the<br />\ndirection of his continuing work.<br />\nThose who know Welch personally<br />\nbelieve he has a real understanding of<br />\nstudents' needs. He has listened long<br />\nand hard to students, and knows how to<br />\naddress their concerns with swiftness<br />\nand efficacy. Having arrived at Hopkins<br />\nfrom the University of Massachusetts,<br />\na large school quite different from<br />\nHopkins, it is remarkable that Welch<br />\nwas able to come to appreciate student<br />\nlife here in such a short time.<br />\nIt is difficult to watch such a talented,<br />\nconcerned man leave our community.<br />\nWe hope that the Administration, in<br />\nchoosing his successor, will keep in<br />\nmind Welch's goals and act<br />\naccordingly.<br />\n<br />\nAh, Rush Week\u2014the time<br />\nwhen<br />\nmemories,<br />\nalbeit<br />\nfragmented memories, are made.<br />\nAs grandparents, this year's participants will someday shock the<br />\npants off of Junior with their<br />\nnever-forgotten, oft-embellished<br />\nstories of Japanese beer and<br />\nKamikaze attacks on babes and<br />\nbeefcakes.

Many native<br />\nBaltimoreans would not agree with you, and lately a few have been<br />\nshowing it in a big way. Over the last two or three years, Baltimore<br />\nhas been gaining on New York and Miami in terms of the number<br />\nof camera crews sent here, both for the movies and television.<br />\nThis past weekend alone, as I decided to stretch my legs and walk<br />\ndown to the harbor, I passed a commotion of people, trucks,<br />\npolicemen, and tied-up traffic as a film crew worked on filming<br />\nBaltimore native Ann Tyler's The Accidental Tourist, starring William<br />\nHurt. Had I hung around, I probably could have been in the movie<br />\nas part of the crowd, but the policeman I talked to didn't think so\"meone waving to the camera and shouting, \"Hi Mom!\" would be<br />\nappropriate, so I moved on.<br />\nA few months ago, Whoopi Goldberg was up at one of the private<br />\ngrade schools\u2014Gilman, I believe\u2014filming another movie whose name<br />\nI cannot recall.

She asked her, \"Are you Whoopi Goldberg?\"<br />\nand the woman replied, \"No, I'm not Whoopi Goldberg,\" and her<br />\ntwo bodyguards said, \"No, she's not Whoopi Goldberg.\"<br />\nMany movies that people have seen and loved already have been<br />\nfilmed here. Most notable of these are Bedroom Window, Diner, Tin<br />\nMen, and Blood Circus. Well, maybe Blood Circus wasn't such a<br />\nhit, but it was fun for the people in the audience during filming. Watching Diner and Tin Men here was also entertaining, as every few<br />\nminutes at least one person in the audience would shout gleefully,<br />\n\"I know that place!\" and \"Hey, that's where we are\u2014Westview<br />\nTheater!\" One of my campers one summer went to the filming of<br />\nBedroom Window and got paid double what I was being paid as a<br />\ncounselor to be part of a crowd.<br />\nBaltimore's television triumphs aren't quite as great, but they're<br />\nthere. Anyone remember The Ellen Burstyn Show? It didn't do that<br />\nwell, running for only a few weeks, and it wasn't actually filmed in<br />\nBaltimore, but that's where it took place, and the outside shot of the<br />\nhouse in the beginning of the show was taken in Pikesville, Northwest<br />\nBaltimore County. Slightly more impressive was this New Year's bash<br />\non PBS filmed at the Baltimore Symphony Orchestra's Meyerhoff<br />\nSymphony Hall and Ethel's Place. This gala would have been a large<br />\nproject for a major network, but for PBS it was amazing, featuring<br />\nthe likes of Harry Anderson, Mel Torme, and our own David Zinrnan.<br />\nSo next time you think Baltimore is less exciting than Hicktown,<br />\nPennsylvania where at least you can have fun cow-tipping, maybe<br />\nyou should look again, a little harder.

I am particularly curious how Lee would<br />\naddress South African brutality<br />\nagainst blacks.

Lee makes his most<br />\nassinine comments in reference to<br />\nGaza. He states that \"Israelis in<br />\nGaza by necessity, not by<br />\nchoice\"? I would like to inform<br />\nLee that Israel makes a profit<br />\nfrom occupation of the Gaza<br />\n(having one of the highest population densities in the world), while<br />\n600,000 Palestinian civilians live<br />\nin deplorable, squalid conditions.<br />\nIn addition, Israel has a cheap<br />\nsupply of menial Palestinian labor<br />\nto sweep the streets of Tel Aviv<br />\nand clean the houses of Israeli<br />\ncitizens. Cheap labor from Gaza<br />\n<br />\nis what keeps the Israeli economy<br />\ngoing because most Israelis are<br />\nnot interested in \"Arab work.\"<br />\nWhat Lee has to comprehend is<br />\nthat these people, the Palestinians, are not just a bunch of<br />\nhooligans who have nothing better to do. Rather, these people are<br />\nfed up Israeli occupation and<br />\nIsraeli brutality. These people are<br />\ntired of discrimination, sick of<br />\nhaving to carry identity cards, fed<br />\nup with economic stagnation due<br />\nto Israeli laws and frustrated with<br />\nviolations of their human rights<br />\nand human dignity.

Put simply, The Carlyle is far from campus and from the bulk of student<br />\nhousing.<br />\nTaking the shortcut behind the<br />\nAthletic Center, a walk to Gilman<br />\nHall takes about ten minutes, a<br />\nnuisance in rain or snow, or when<br />\nthe paths are icy, a persistent<br />\nBaltimore problem.<br />\nThe distance also becomes a<br />\nhassle when a student forgets<br />\nsomething at home or has widelyspaced classes. Students at The<br />\nCarlyle should plan their<br />\nschedules accordingly because a<br />\nround trip from apartment to<br />\ncampus and back could easily<br />\ntake a half hour.<br />\nA second negative is that The<br />\nCarlyle is far from the great majority of student housing.<br />\nStudents living in The Carlyle,<br />\nparticularly women, should plan<br />\nto use the security shuttle at<br />\nnights, for their own safety.<br />\nA third negative, perhaps particular to The Carlyle, concerns<br />\nthe water supply. A couple of<br />\ntimes each month, residents can<br />\nexpect minimal or no hot water<br />\nfor showers. Furthermore, during<br />\nlate night and early morning<br />\nhours, little cold water comes out<br />\nof faucets in some apartments.<br />\nCarlyle officials have told us<br />\nthat they are considering plans to<br />\nreplace the boiler. Maintenance,<br />\nhowever, is good and quite fast.<br />\nThen comes the matter of rent.<br />\nThe Carlyle is not inexpensive.<br />\nMost students should plan to<br />\n<br />\nroom with at least two other<br />\nstudents to keep living at The<br />\nCarlyle from becoming prohibitively expensive.<br />\nCurrent rates for one bedroom<br />\napartments are $600 and $625 a<br />\nmonth. Two bedroom apartments<br />\ncost $800 to $840 a month. All<br />\nleases are for twelve months, and<br />\nThe Carlyle reserves the right to \u2022<br />\nraise rents after February. Rents<br />\nrose approximately five percent<br />\nlast year. Furnished apartments<br />\ncost more.<br />\nStudents should therefore expect to pay between $200 and<br />\n$325 a month for rent, which includes heat but not utilities. The<br />\naverage rent is high for the area,<br />\nbut not unreasonably so. Most<br />\nstudents will share bedrooms,<br />\nunless a group of three can convert a dining room.<br />\nIn sum, whether The Carlyle<br />\nrepresents the ideal living space<br />\ndepends on a student's priorities.<br />\nDisregarding the issue of cost, the<br />\ndecision to live in The Carlyle<br />\ncomes down to a choice between<br />\ncomfort and convenience.<br />\n<br />\nMcCoy Hall<br />\nby Aaron Davis<br />\nAlthough it won't make the inevitable sting any less severe, I'll<br />\ngive you the good news about<br />\nMcCoy first. The four-tiered<br />\nbuilding sits at the corner of 33rd<br />\nand Charles on a prime piece of<br />\nreal estate, and this, perhaps, is<br />\nMcCoy's greatest advantage. No<br />\nclass is more than five minutes<br />\naway. If you hold your breath as<br />\nyou walk out the back door, you<br />\nwill have plenty of02 to spare at<br />\nWawa and will still cling to consciousness by the time you reach<br />\nEddies.<br />\nSee McCOY, page 13<br />\n<br />\n\fNEWS-LETTER/13<br />\n<br />\nFeatures housing guide<br />\nMcCOY, from page 12<br />\nUnlike many of B'more's<br />\nsleazelords, the university housing staff is accesible\u2014just across<br />\nthe street\u2014and very friendly.<br />\nThey will do their best to make<br />\nyou comfortable. The mailroom<br />\nis just downstairs, and packages<br />\n(not that I ever get any) can be<br />\npicked up every afternoon. The<br />\nsocial lounge is great, as are the<br />\nfree-grub affairs sponsored by the<br />\ncommunity assistants.

The best ways to find one is<br />\nto wander the neighborhoods<br />\nlooking for \"for rent\" signs, or<br />\nask an upperclassman friend who<br />\nlives in one for the number of the<br />\nlandlord, who can best tell you<br />\nwhich ones will be available for<br />\nnext year.<br />\n<br />\nRowhouses<br />\nby Jay Lechtman<br />\nThere is no \"typical\"<br />\nor<br />\nrowhouse,<br />\nrowhouse<br />\napartment\u2014they range from expensively furnished with parquet<br />\nfloors, washer and dryer, parking<br />\nspace, and grand piano\u2014to dirt<br />\ncheap basement efficiency.<br />\nIn the neighborhood of<br />\nHopkins, rowhouses abound from<br />\nSt. Paul east to Barclay, University Parkway south to 25th Street,<br />\nand Maryland Avenue west to<br />\nKeswick. Prices for a rowhouse<br />\napartment tend to be much lower<br />\nthan an equivalently sized<br />\nbuilding apartment, as low as<br />\n$150-$200 per person per month<br />\nfor your own room, but they<br />\noften lack such amenities as proximity to campus, in-building laundry machines, or security entrances. There is usually plenty of<br />\nunlimited on-street parking for<br />\nthe price of a ten dollar annual city permit, parking garages are<br />\nsometimes available from the<br />\nlandlord, and some rowhouses<br />\nhave their own parking spaces in<br />\nthe alleys that run behind them.<br />\nFinding an entire rowhouse and<br />\ngrabbing five of your friends can<br />\ngrab you one of the lowest housing costs in the area, and<br />\n<br />\nWolman Hall<br />\nby Diana Zeiger<br />\nWolman Hall is situated directly across Charles Street from the<br />\nM.S.E. Library, in-between<br />\nMcCoy Hall and the Charles, and<br />\ntherein lies perhaps its greatest<br />\nadvantage\u2014it is one of the most<br />\nconveniently located sources of<br />\nhousing around, Universityowned or otherwise. It's only<br />\nabout a five-minute walk to any<br />\ncampus building you would care<br />\n<br />\nto name, the Greenway Pharmacy<br />\nis in McCoy Hall next door,<br />\nWawa is on the next block, and<br />\nit only takes five minutes to walk<br />\nto Eddie's (and 15 to 20 to get to<br />\nthe Rotunda). If you like to eat<br />\nout, Casey's is. just across St.<br />\nPaul and PizzApeel is a block<br />\naway.<br />\nAnother nice thing about<br />\nWolman Hall is space. Even the<br />\nsmaller rooms are a lot larger<br />\nthan many I have seen in other<br />\nlocations. In addition, there are<br />\nattractive wood floors in the<br />\napartments and there is plenty of<br />\ncloset and cabinet space. Whether<br />\nyou get an apartment with large<br />\nrooms and a large kitchen<br />\ndepends, literally, on the luck of<br />\nthe draw, but it's still pretty hard<br />\nto find a \"broom closet\"<br />\napartment.<br />\nIf you're wondering about<br />\nmaintenance, personal experience<br />\nhas shown that most requests are<br />\nanswered within a reasonable<br />\namount of time. If they aren't, a<br />\nlittle prodding at the Off-Campus<br />\nHousing Maintenance Office<br />\n(which is located on the first floor<br />\nof Wolman Hall) usually gets a<br />\nresponse. There's also a number<br />\nyou can call during regular work<br />\nhours, plus an emergency<br />\nmaintenance number for other<br />\ntimes. Additionally, regular extermination service is provided.<br />\nThe rest of the advantages of<br />\nliving in Wolman Hall are the<br />\nregular advantages of living in<br />\nUniversity-owned housing.<br />\nEverything but telephone is included in the rent, so there's no<br />\nworry about utility bills.

You sign 9-month<br />\nleases with the option to renew, I<br />\nso you don't have to pay rent or<br />\nfind someone to sublet during the<br />\nsommer for an apartment you<br />\naren't living in. Perhaps most importantly, there are Security<br />\nmonitors posted in the lobby and<br />\na buzzer system, also for security. And since it's only other<br />\nstudents around you (and the<br />\nwalls are pretty thick) not too<br />\nmany people mind if you play<br />\nyour stereo loud.<br />\nOf course, anywhere you live<br />\nis going to have its disadvantages<br />\nand problems. Wolman is<br />\nnotorious for a cockroach problem, but in many cases it is exaggerated. If you take advantage<br />\nof the extermination service (even<br />\nrequest additional exterminations,<br />\nif necessary), faithfully use Combat, and keep a can of Raid or DCon handy in the warmer<br />\nweather, the little buggies won't<br />\nbother you so much\u2014and they go<br />\naway, for the most part, in colder weather. Another questionable element is the condition<br />\nof the apartment itself\u2014peeling<br />\npaint, stuck windows, broken<br />\ntiles, or shabby windows. But<br />\nagain, this is a matter that can be<br />\ntaken care of\u2014the people in the<br />\nHousing Office and in the<br />\nMaintenance Office are quite<br />\nwilling to help if you just go in<br />\nand ask.<br />\nThere is, however, one disadvantage that is pretty difficult to<br />\novercome\u2014in the warmer<br />\nweather, Wolman Hall is hot, and<br />\nis not centrally air-conditioned. In<br />\nAugust, September, and late<br />\nMay, it will often feel hotter indoors than out. It is possible to<br />\nget box air conditioners installed,<br />\nbut it's expensive; it's also not<br />\npracticle to do a whole apartment.<br />\n<br />\nBring a big fan and the faith that<br />\nthe heat waves will end (they<br />\nalways do). The flip side of this<br />\nis, however, that it's nearly impossible to get cold in Wolman in<br />\nthe wintertime.<br />\nSpeaking of warmth, hot water<br />\n(or lack thereof, to be more<br />\nspecific) is occasionally a problem, but is usually quickly corrected. Also, some sink and<br />\nbathtub drains are slow to drain,<br />\nbut again, maintenance is willing<br />\nto help if you ask.<br />\nThe cost of renting apartments<br />\nat Wolman Hall starts at $2265<br />\nfor 9 months for a small, singlebedroom unit for two students<br />\nwith living room, bedroom, kitchen, and bath, and goes up to<br />\n$3805 for 9 months for a single<br />\nefficiency with combination living/bedroom, kitchen unit, and<br />\nbath. There are various options<br />\navailable for two-student shares,<br />\nas well as three-, four- and fivestudent suites and single<br />\naccommodations.<br />\nIn closing, the biggest thing to<br />\nrecommend Wolman hall is its<br />\nconvenience, from both location<br />\nand payment/one-bill expenditure<br />\nstandpoints. There are problems,<br />\nas there are anywhere, but it's up<br />\nto you to decide whether they are<br />\noutweighed by the advantages.<br />\n<br />\nbuilding is also clime to Wawa<br />\nand the group of stores on St.<br />\nPaul between 31st and 32nd.<br />\nHowever, such convenience does<br />\nnot come cheaply. The Charles<br />\nalso boasts some of the highest<br />\nrental rates around. Students can<br />\nexpect to pay between $300 and<br />\n$400 per month per person, for<br />\naccomodations ranging from oneroom efficiencies to two-bedroom<br />\napartments. Residents must pay<br />\nfor their own utilities, but heat<br />\nand hot water are included in the<br />\nrent. It must be noted, however,<br />\n<br />\nthat The Charles' prices compare<br />\nfavorably with housing of the<br />\nsame proximity to campus, including University housing.<br />\nThe Charles is one of the older<br />\nbuildings around, and lacks many<br />\nof the creature comforts that the<br />\nhigh prices warrant. There is no<br />\ntrash chute, so residents must take<br />\ntheir garbage down to the basement. This is not such an inconvenience, when (if) the<br />\nelevator is in operation. The<br />\nelevator breaks down on the<br />\naverage of once every two weeks,<br />\nand if you're lucky, someone will<br />\nbe working the service elevator.<br />\nIf not, get used to lots of exercise.<br />\nThe management is currently<br />\nrefurbishing the elevator, but it<br />\nremains to be seen whether the<br />\n`new' elevator will be an improvement. Until then, don't take<br />\nan apartment on one of the upper<br />\nfloors.<br />\nThe apartments are generally<br />\nspacious and airy, although some<br />\nof the larger apartments have<br />\nbeen divided up into somewhat<br />\nsmaller, but still nice units, and<br />\nthe front apartments offer a<br />\nbeautiful view of campus. The<br />\nkitchens are small, but adequate.<br />\nThe bathrooms are ancient, but<br />\nfunctional. Laundry facilities<br />\ncontain four washing machines<br />\n($1 each) and four dryers ($.75<br />\neach) and you can usually get a<br />\nmachine or two, if you're willing<br />\nto do your laundry at unusual<br />\nhours. However, the laundry<br />\nroom is in the basement,<br />\ntherefore your plans are subject<br />\nto the whims of the elevator,<br />\nbecause it can be difficult to carry<br />\nyour clothes up and down many<br />\nflights of stairs. Also in the basement is P.J.'s Pub, a must for<br />\nsports fans. On any given night<br />\nyou can catch college and pro<br />\nbasketball, hockey and a variety<br />\n<br />\nAwalik.C.x<br />\n<br />\nof other sports.<br />\nA year and a half ago, the<br />\nCharles and Blackstone Apartments, both under the same<br />\nmanagement, went through, it<br />\nseemed, a new manager every<br />\nmonth. It was hard to make requests, or get to know the,<br />\nmanager. Since then, there has<br />\nbeen a steady manager, who has<br />\nbrought about a lot of positive<br />\nchanges, the most impressive of<br />\nwhich is the overhaul of the<br />\nelevator mentioned above. The<br />\nmanager also does thoughtful<br />\nthings, such as a Christmas buffet of cold cuts and cake in the<br />\nlobby last year for all residents.<br />\nMaintenance in the Charles has<br />\nbeen a problem with major jobs,<br />\nlike the elevator, but they are<br />\nvery good about coming if you<br />\nhave an immediate problem such<br />\nas the sink leaking or the toilet<br />\noverflowing. They just finished<br />\nrepainting the lobby, and are in<br />\nthe process of doing so with the<br />\nhalls. Maintenance has improved<br />\non a direct scale with the tenure<br />\nof the current manager.<br />\nThe building is about 80%<br />\nstudents, but don't expect the<br />\nopen door friendliness of the<br />\ndorms. After all, The Charles is<br />\na private apartment building. The<br />\nsecurity system could use improvement, because if you look<br />\ninnocent enough, eventually<br />\nsomeone will let you into the<br />\nbuilding. The front door has been<br />\nknown to be propped open during the day. The hallways are<br />\ndarker than desirable, creating the<br />\npossibility for further security<br />\nproblems. The management has<br />\ntaken steps in this direction by<br />\nhiring a night security guard.<br />\nOverall, if you are looking for<br />\na more luxurious alternative to<br />\nSee CHARLES, page 15<br />\n<br />\nataae<br />\n,<br />\n<br />\nThe Charles<br />\nby Michael Farbowitz and<br />\nFlory Ware<br />\nThe Charles Apartments,<br />\nlocated at 3333 N.

First of all, the management is hard to contact and has<br />\nharassed us about a check that the<br />\nguys before us didn't send when<br />\nthey paid their last month's rent<br />\nat graduation last year. It has been<br />\nan ongoing problem, and the<br />\nmanager's attitude until very<br />\nrecently was that it was our duty<br />\nas current leaseholders to find the<br />\nmanagement's bookkeeping error The Northway Apartments<br />\n<br />\nThe Hopkins House is unquestionably one of the most comfortable and modern apartment<br />\nbuildings near campus, but like<br />\nany place, it has its drawbacks<br />\nand quirks.<br />\nLocated on the corner of 39th<br />\nSt. and University Parkway, the<br />\nHopkins House is wellmaintained, with a brightly lit<br />\nlobby and twenty-four hour<br />\nsecurity complemented by a<br />\ntelephone-style entry code<br />\nsystem.<br />\nDuring the summer months,<br />\nfrom May to September, the pool<br />\nand jacuzzi, situated on the<br />\ngrounds, are open. All residents<br />\nare members of the pool club<br />\nwhich on occasion stages a night<br />\nparty at the pool.<br />\nAn important thing to bear in<br />\nmind when looking at the<br />\nHopkins House is that although<br />\ndifferent apartments may be called one or two-bedroom units, the<br />\nactual Mies vary enormously.<br />\nLiving rooms in one-bedroom<br />\napartments, for example, may be<br />\nthe size of parking lots, whereas<br />\nin another unit of similar price the<br />\nliving room is much smaller. One<br />\ntends to compromise the kitchen<br />\nfor a larger living room, so make<br />\nsure you look around.<br />\nAll of the apartments are maintained in good condition and any<br />\nneeded maintenance requests are<br />\ndealt with promptly. Apartments<br />\nare repainted before a new resident moves, and they have wood<br />\nfloors, but the lease requires that<br />\nfloors be carpeted to cut down on<br />\nnoise. The apartments are fairly<br />\nwell insulated from one another,<br />\nbut one can hear footsteps in the<br />\napartment above without the requisite carpeting. All apartments<br />\nare air-conditioned, which for<br />\nthose who spend the summer in<br />\nBaltimore is almost a necessity.<br />\nby Richard Bell and Jay Engler<br />\nOn the downside, the apartments do have roaches, although<br />\nnot nearly as many as some<br />\nbuildings in the area, and the<br />\nmanagement is relatively good<br />\nabout fumigating.<br />\nOf all the disadvantages of the<br />\nHopkins House, students seem to<br />\nmind the relative distance to campus more than anything else.<br />\nAlthough the walk is fifteen<br />\nminutes or less, those can be<br />\nfiteeen minutes from Hell in this<br />\nfriendly climate. Sidewalks are<br />\nrarely shoveled, although if the<br />\nice stays around for a few days<br />\nsome sawdust may appear. Most<br />\nimportantly, the distance<br />\ndiscourages most people from<br />\nreturning home between classes,<br />\n'and generally creates a<br />\npsychological gulf between campus and home.<br />\nThe cost of the apartments is<br />\nhigh in comparison with other<br />\nhousing options. There are a total<br />\nof six different models ranging<br />\nfrom a studio to a luxury twobedroom. The costs of the different models vary with the<br />\ndesign and range from about $400<br />\nfor the minimum studio to $700<br />\nfor the two-bedroom unit.<br />\nAll utilities are included in the<br />\nrent. Parking is available adjacent<br />\nto the building for an additional<br />\n$40 per month.<br />\n<br />\ndoing ourselves. With promises<br />\nof \"next week, I'll come fix your<br />\nbathroom\" since August, we've<br />\n'had an unfinished bathroom.<br />\nWhen the maintenance guy comes<br />\nto fix it, he plasters it and never<br />\nshows back up. Those of you who<br />\nhave seen what steam does to unpainted plaster know what the<br />\nbathroom looks like now (we'd<br />\npaint it ourselves just to have it<br />\nover and done with, but the<br />\nbathroom walls have a sort of<br />\nstucco finish that we can't<br />\nduplicate).<br />\nUnfortunately, that is not the<br />\nonly problem with maintenance.<br />\nSome friends of mine had an incomprehensible and mysterious<br />\nwater leak from their ceiling last<br />\nyear in various annoying locations in their apartment. It took<br />\nthem quite some time to stop the<br />\nleaks, and they still, after at least.<br />\na year, haven't gotten any repairs<br />\ndone to their badly damaged ceiling and walls.<br />\nIf you can get an apartment<br />\nwithout any maintenance problems, the Burford is a really<br />\ngood deal. On the whole, we're<br />\nvery satisfied with our apartment,<br />\nalthough I know that the two<br />\nfriend I just mentioned aren't.<br />\nThere's one other problem, and<br />\nthat is that the Burford is not a<br />\nplace which has apartments that<br />\ncome up very often. We got ours<br />\nbecause we knew people that<br />\nwere graduating, and I should add<br />\nthat our rent is a bit lower because<br />\nwe took over their lease.

If it were<br />\na review I would say how great<br />\nthe plays were on Friday and<br />\nSaturday night. Since it's not a<br />\nreview, though, I won't say that.<br />\nThat's what this is not. What<br />\nthis is is an attempt to answer all<br />\nthose people who ask me and<br />\neveryone else who was involved<br />\nin the shows, \"What's it like to<br />\nwork with Edward Albee?\"<br />\nIt is understandable that they<br />\nask. After all, working with<br />\nAlbee is probably the most impressive-sounding thing I've done<br />\nat Hopkins. It is a real status symbol. But apart from wowing people with his name and reputation,<br />\njust what does this worldrenowned playwright bring to the<br />\nHopkins community?<br />\nFunny you should ask that.<br />\n<br />\nWe who work with Edward<br />\nAlbee have been wondering too.<br />\nIt is a major topic of conversation<br />\nevery year. And there are always<br />\ndisagreements on the real *educational usefulness of the program.<br />\nThat's the locker-room talk, in<br />\ncase you ever wondered.<br />\nPart of the problem is that<br />\nevery year the degree of Albee's<br />\ninvolvement with the show<br />\nchanges. In my sophomore year,<br />\nwhen I became involved in the<br />\nshows for the first time, Albee<br />\nwas almost invisible. I saw him<br />\nat the audition and then not again<br />\nuntil the cast party. I'm not certain that I ever even spoke to him<br />\nthat year. As far as I could tell,<br />\nhe was this luminary figure that<br />\nlent his name and aura to the program and beyond that not much<br />\nmore.<br />\nWait, no, actually he did come<br />\nin one time that year and tell us<br />\nthat the playwright was God.<br />\n<br />\nThen he smiled beneath his saltand-pepper moustache (sort of<br />\nmysteriously, it seemed to me at<br />\nthe time), tossed his scarf over his<br />\nshoulder and left.<br />\nJunior year was an entirely different story. Albee directed each<br />\nof the six plays. The plays<br />\nrehearse Monday through Friday<br />\nfor an hour and a half apiece. Six<br />\nplays meant that Albee was putting in a 9 hour day. It was not<br />\nuntil about two weeks into the<br />\nshow that he relinquished some of<br />\nhis power to the anxiously<br />\nwaiting assistant directors. These<br />\nstudents then took over conducting the rehearsals of an already<br />\nblocked show. Albee showed up<br />\na couple times a week.<br />\nThat was the best year to be an<br />\nactor or a playwright. Albee<br />\ndemanded our best work and we<br />\ngave it to him. His direction<br />\ntaught me a lot about how to take<br />\na written play and make it work<br />\n<br />\nSpinal Tap). They open with load<br />\nof jive lifted from half a dozen<br />\nassorted heavy metal shows,<br />\nreplete with Satan's horns hand<br />\ngesturing and tongue-in-cheek<br />\nGene Simmons tongue wagging.<br />\nThe crowd seems to dig it for the<br />\nmost part and the band is definitely having fun. Tonight's punk<br />\ncontingent seems content to<br />\nheckle quietly in the back. So, no<br />\nfree lunch for the openers, which<br />\nis as it should be.<br />\nFinally, the headliners, the men<br />\nwe came to see, make it to the<br />\nstage. They look a little tired but<br />\nwhat do you expect? They're<br />\nhalfway through their east coast<br />\ntour, heading south, and they<br />\ndidn't get to bed until six in the<br />\nmorning. Still, the music doesn't<br />\n<br />\nsuffer much. No, they are not the<br />\nsort of fellows who scissor kick<br />\ntheir way through a gig but what<br />\ndoes that really have to do with<br />\nthe music?<br />\nAh, yes, the music. \"What do<br />\nthey sound like?\" was a question<br />\nI got asked by just about<br />\neverybody I talked to before the<br />\nshow. \"Well, they're. . . rock<br />\nand roll. You know, guitar, bass,<br />\nand drums,\" I would say. It's<br />\ntrue but it's not the whole story.<br />\nAccording to the band's bio, they<br />\nwere around, in slightly different<br />\nform, during the \"halcyon days\"<br />\nof early punk. And it shows,<br />\nespecially on some of their more<br />\nraucous numbers. The quick tempo changes from the verse to the<br />\nchorus, the mantric quality of the<br />\nchord changes, and the abrasive<br />\ntexture of the instrumentation<br />\n(though few punks back then had<br />\nMarshall stacks), are all<br />\ntrademarks of such bands as<br />\nTelevision, and, more recently,<br />\nDie Kreuzen. Unlike many of<br />\ntheir predecessors, however,<br />\nAngst plays a full range of songs,<br />\nslower, more gentle. Their roots<br />\nare clearly in rock and blues<br />\nmusic, though they occasionally<br />\nfind themselves in jazz-like territory. All in all, they are varied<br />\nand expressive enough to keep the<br />\nlistener's interest throughout their<br />\ntwo forty-five minute sets.<br />\nTragically, as is often the case at<br />\nHopkins, other events the same<br />\nevening prevent anything more<br />\nthan a token turnout. As the evening progresses fewer and fewer<br />\npeople remain to groove. Such is<br />\n<br />\n.,<br />\nGroom to Angst in the Great Hall<br />\nby Mark W. Stewart<br />\nWell, first of all, they're late.<br />\nTheir road manager estimated arrival time at 6:30 but it's 7:45<br />\nnow and still no word. If the band<br />\nis late, they're late. If they don't<br />\ncome, they don't come. That's<br />\nwhat I tell myself.<br />\nThey get there about 9:15, very<br />\napologetic.

The actors<br />\nwould shrug in assent. It worked.<br />\nThe difficulty that year was that<br />\nthe assistant directors didn't get<br />\nenough of a chance to direct.<br />\nThey spent most of the time<br />\nobserving or taking care of the<br />\ndrudgery. Albee did the fun stuff.<br />\nStill, I think we all at least got to<br />\nsee the artist at work.<br />\nThis year Albee swung the<br />\nother way again. He showed up<br />\nsometimes and made great suggestions, but didn't really play a<br />\nconstant role. He directed only<br />\none of the six plays this year<br />\nbecause there was a no-show student director. The other plays<br />\nwere pretty much on their own.<br />\nIn many ways, this worked to our<br />\nadvantage.<br />\nAlthough Albee had given us<br />\nall a speech about the chain of<br />\ncommand (according to which the<br />\nactor and the playwright can only communicate through the<br />\ndirector), in my play we soon<br />\nthrew caution to the wind and had<br />\ngroup discussions about the play.<br />\nSometimes these got messy. Toes<br />\nwere probably stepped on. But<br />\nheck, we all learned a helluvalot<br />\nabout what the other people in the<br />\nshow were going through. There<br />\nwas a real sense of a common<br />\ngoal. We were all working<br />\ntogether to make this play the best<br />\nit possibly could be.<br />\nTalking to other people in other<br />\nshows I realize that each play<br />\ncontributed to a different kind of<br />\nexperience. I believe this year,<br />\nmore than any other, the shows<br />\ncame together. That is to say that<br />\nin years past you worked with<br />\nyour own play in your own time<br />\nslot and never got much of a<br />\nchance to see or speak to anyone<br />\nfrom another show. Because<br />\nsome of the shows had extra-large<br />\ncasts this year, there was a lot of<br />\n<br />\ninteraction.<br />\nAlbee showed up once in<br />\nawhile this year to make sure we<br />\nwere on the right track.<br />\nSometimes he would come in for<br />\nonly a few minutes and fix<br />\nsomething in the show that we<br />\nknew was a problem but didn't<br />\nknow how to solve. There'd be<br />\nthis feeling of\"A-ha, why didn't<br />\nI think of that.\" And you'd know<br />\nthat next time we would think of<br />\nthat. We had learned.<br />\nI had the feeling that if we had<br />\nreally needed his help he would<br />\nhave been there. With this safety<br />\nnet beneath us we were all able<br />\nto take some risks on our own.<br />\nWe pretty much did it ourselves.<br />\nJudging from the number of<br />\npeople who auditioned for these<br />\nshows and from the number of<br />\npeople who attended them, there is<br />\nan overwhelming demand for<br />\nquality theater on campus. The<br />\nBarnstormers make great strides<br />\nevery year, but they are students<br />\nfighting an unfriendly system. A<br />\nman with pull like Edward Albee<br />\ncan get things done administratively here that students<br />\ncannot. The rededication of the LV Room in Professor Arellano's<br />\nmemory is one example of<br />\nsomething that we all wanted to<br />\ndo. Albee just met with President<br />\nMuller and it was as good as<br />\ndone. If Hopkins has this much<br />\nrespect for Albee and he is a man<br />\nof the theater, then why don't<br />\nthey have as much respect for the<br />\nstudents interested in theater here<br />\nat Hopkins?<br />\nA student with such \"artsy\" interests could develop a real confidence problem here in the land<br />\nof practicality. And that brings us<br />\nto the best thing about working<br />\nwith Albee. He is a successful artist. This phrase has become an<br />\noxymoron here at Hopkins. Albee<br />\nintroduces a concept otherwise<br />\nforeign to Hopkins. It's OK to<br />\nwant to be an artist. You may<br />\neven succeed.<br />\n<br />\nAn entertaining<br />\nGood Morning Vietnam<br />\nby Sandrine Tiller<br />\nGood Morning Vietnam is a fun<br />\nmovie. It takes place in the early<br />\n60's in Saigon, and tells the (true)<br />\nstory of a disc jockey for the<br />\nArmed Forces network who<br />\nbecame extremely popular with<br />\nthe troops. The film starts with<br />\nthe broadcast before the new disc<br />\njockey (Robin Williams) arrives.<br />\nThis disc jockey sounds like a<br />\npresident<br />\non<br />\nuniversity<br />\nquaaludes. The radio station is<br />\nmainly populated by straightlaced, crew cut officers. Enter<br />\nRobin Williams, who begins his<br />\nbroadcast with a rousing \"GOOD<br />\nMORNING VIETNAM!\", then<br />\nproceeds to make jokes about<br />\nEthel Merman jamming up Soviet<br />\nradar, fashionable uniforms, and<br />\nthen plays some James Brown.<br />\nThis kind of \"radicalism\" draws<br />\nthe attention of some of his<br />\nsuperiors, who have different notions of humor and want to play<br />\nPerry Como instead of Martha<br />\nand the Vandellas. Williams falls<br />\nin love with a Vietnamese girl,<br />\n<br />\nteaches her English class, and<br />\nbecomes friends with her brother.<br />\nHe becomes more and more involved in the society there, and<br />\nbegins to notice many inequalities. He defends justice and<br />\nfights censorship. This eventually costs him his job.<br />\nAs previously demonstrated in<br />\nThe World According to Gatp<br />\nand Moscow on the Hudson,<br />\nWilliams is an accomplished actor. He brings a freshness and<br />\ncandor to the screen. He is at his<br />\nbest when he is improvising on<br />\nhis radio show. The military<br />\ncharacters are his foil, and often<br />\nthey seem straight out of<br />\nM*A*S*H. Sometimes the films<br />\nseems a bit too \"eighties-ish\"<br />\nwith the GIs sporting fashionable<br />\nhaircuts.<br />\nThe traditional Vietnam-movie<br />\nmoralizing is toned down and<br />\nsubtle. This makes for an entertaining, easy-viewing movie.<br />\nGood Morning Vietnam is at its<br />\nbest when it unleashes Williams'<br />\ncomic genius.<br />\n<br />\n\f20/FEBRUARY 5, 1988<br />\n<br />\nDream Disc<br />\n<br />\nThe Flip Side by Phil Gochenour<br />\nby Phil Gochenour<br />\nWell, a good friend of mine<br />\nrecently told me I should be<br />\ncovering more British albums,<br />\nbecause all the really hip stuff<br />\nhere comes from there. This, in<br />\nconjunction with my perusal of<br />\nthe year-end issue of Melody<br />\nMaker(A Brit music mag), convinced me that maybe I should<br />\nlook into some of these British<br />\ngroups. This is mainly because I<br />\nhadn't heard of half the people in<br />\ntheir top ten. So, after scouring<br />\nrecord bins from here to DC, I<br />\nhave come up with some capsule<br />\nreviews of some of the more \"important\" recent British releases.<br />\nThe Young Gods-The Young<br />\nGods (EP). Melody Maker<br />\nlavished just about every praise<br />\non these guys that you could think<br />\nof, not the least of which was the<br />\npronouncement that 'they are the<br />\nfuture.' Pretty bleak looking<br />\nplace, the future. The Young<br />\nGods are three guys with a<br />\nsampler and a drum machine, and<br />\nwhat they construct with these instruments can only be described<br />\nas a percussion track with the occassional (very occassional)<br />\nsampled guitar riff or sound<br />\nlayered in on top. Now, this<br />\ndoesn't sound like much, but the<br />\nend result is one of the densest<br />\nmixes I've ever heard, and god,<br />\nis it brutal. Flying shreds of metal<br />\nmight describe it\u2014pure animal<br />\nfury comes pretty close. Like<br />\nmost of these British releases, this<br />\nis best appreciated when heard on<br />\n<br />\na dance floor. Only a club sound<br />\nsystem can put this up to the pure<br />\near-bleeding volume it deserves.<br />\nThis is music stripped down to the<br />\nbarest bones of rhythm, which is<br />\nOK for dancing, but I don't<br />\nknow how it would wear over<br />\ntime\u2014thrash seems to be the<br />\nAmerican equivalant, and that<br />\ngets old pretty quick. But, check<br />\nit out for yourself\u2014you might<br />\nfind yourself on the cutting edge<br />\nof the future.<br />\nThe Sisters of Mercy\u2014<br />\nFlood/and. Andrew Eldritch (the<br />\nonly remaining sister since the<br />\nother sisters split to form The<br />\nMission U.K.) seems to have<br />\nlistened to a little too much Iggy<br />\nPop as produced by David<br />\nBowie. He snarls, he growls, he<br />\ndoes his best to live up to a<br />\nsinister Goth image. (Goth is a<br />\nBritish movement that has spawned such groups as The Cult, who<br />\nused to be called Southern Death<br />\nCult. That should tell you what<br />\nthe movement is like.) To a large<br />\ndegree, he succeeds. The music<br />\nis as grandiose as a Wagnerian<br />\nopera, with delicate fillagrees of<br />\nsynth and guitar filling in the upper ranges.

As His Majesty's treasury became fuller every day, the<br />\nPrincess became lazier. She neither learned the great<br />\nliteratures that the wise men in the court had created, nor<br />\nhelped in other people's activities. Each day she would finish<br />\nher breakfast, lunch, or dinner only to shut herself in a dark<br />\nroom, barred from any light, sound, or other human activities.<br />\nEveryone disliked the Princess' attitude, especially the<br />\nFairy of Spring. Up in the mountain where the Fairy dwelt,<br />\nthe sun shined, the flowers bloomed and the birds sang, full<br />\nof life. Never had she seen such a lazy person with no respect<br />\nfor life. The Fairy hurried to the Princess and said, \"From<br />\nnow on you must shed your laziness and do the things that<br />\nare meaningful in life. If not, great tragedy will fall upon you.\"<br />\nThe Princess took no heed of the warning.

AIDS<br />\nwas the big story in nearly all of<br />\nour nation's big-city hospitals as<br />\nfears mounted when the disease<br />\nspread to even greater numbers of<br />\npeople. Furthermore, last year<br />\nwas a banner year for medicine,<br />\nwith developments ranging from<br />\nheart-lung transplants to the<br />\nevidence that there is something<br />\npeople can do about their<br />\nwrinkles.<br />\nThe stories that broke last year<br />\nfill thousands of pages of our nation's journals and pop-science<br />\nmagazines, and reports of the<br />\nevents at Hopkins hold a hearty<br />\nshare of those publications. Here<br />\nin the Science section, we have<br />\ntried to present the discoveries<br />\nand trends that have been fostered<br />\nand nourished at Hopkins, and we<br />\nthought it would be fun to take a<br />\nlook back to some of the major<br />\narticles and themes that were<br />\ndescribed on these pages. Here,<br />\nthen, are what we feel to be the<br />\nmost important stories of 1987.<br />\nThe top item in 1987 definitely was the continuing AIDS<br />\nepidemic. Inner city hospitals,<br />\nJohns Hopkins included, had to<br />\nprovide for the many patients<br />\nstricken with this relatively new<br />\ndisease that mankind seems<br />\nsomewhat powerless against. As<br />\nresearchers race to find some<br />\nmore clues to the mechanism of<br />\nthe immune disorder, the disease<br />\ncontinues to spread internationally. Although the stream of news<br />\n<br />\nfrom the country's research<br />\ncenters is almost incessant with<br />\nlittle victories over the disease,<br />\nexperts pessimistically predict<br />\nthat a vaccine and cure for the<br />\ndisease will not be available until at least the start of the next<br />\ncentury.<br />\nExcitement was in the air this<br />\npast summer as scientific sponsors were making pitches at Dr.<br />\nRobert Gallo, a top U.S. researcher of AIDS at the National Institutes of Health, to come up to<br />\nBaltimore from Washington to<br />\nhead his own laboratory with support from Johns Hopkins. The<br />\nsponsors withdrew their support<br />\nthis fall, so Dr. Gallo has decided to remain in Washington to<br />\npursue his own research. That has<br />\nnot stopped Hopkins, however,<br />\nfrom opening its own AIDS<br />\nresearch center at the Hospital<br />\nwith hopes of finding a vaccine<br />\nfor the deadly retrovirus.<br />\nSuperconductors were the second biggest story last year. A<br />\npractically ignored field until just<br />\na few years ago, physicists have<br />\ntaken up the task of finding those<br />\nmaterials that can conduct electricity with extremely small<br />\nresistance. The Nobel Prize in<br />\nPhysics was awarded last year to<br />\ntwo researchers who found a<br />\nceramic material that could superconduct at temperatures that were<br />\nrelatively easy and cheap to maintain. The applications to computers, communications, and<br />\ntrain travel could be enormous.<br />\nResearchers, including a team at<br />\nHomewood, are currently working on trying to make the superconductors in shapes that industries can use\u2014wires and<br />\nsheets, for example. The work is<br />\nnot as easy as it sounds, but once<br />\nit is done many scientists feel that<br />\nthe world will undergo a second<br />\n<br />\nrevolution in electronics and<br />\ncreate the next generation of<br />\ncomputers.<br />\nAnother big story of the year<br />\nwas one we had little information<br />\nabout\u2014the Mind-Brain Institute<br />\nthat has been planned for<br />\nHomewood. Designed to be a<br />\nplace where researchers in<br />\nneuroscience, psychology,<br />\nphilosophy, and biophysics could<br />\nget together and investigate the<br />\nburgeoning field of our human<br />\nbrains and how they are different<br />\nfrom or connected to our minds.<br />\nAlready in the planning stages,<br />\nwith their headquarters located in<br />\nJenkins Hall, the Institute will<br />\neventually be housed in a building<br />\noff San Martin Drive, south of the<br />\nAthletic Center. Projected date of<br />\nthe completion of the facilities is<br />\nin the early 1990's.<br />\nAlso on San Martin Drive, the<br />\nSpace Telescope Institute is nearly doubling its office space in<br />\npreparation of the restart of space<br />\nshuttle flights later on this year.<br />\nThe Challenger disaster two years<br />\n<br />\nago was a devastating blow to<br />\nHopkins, as projects being<br />\ndeveloped by the Space Telescope<br />\nInstitute such as the HUT<br />\n(Hutzler Ultraviolet Telescope)<br />\nhad to be delayed indefinitely until NASA could ensure safe<br />\nflights into space. 1987 was a lean<br />\nyear for the STI, but hopefully<br />\nthe year has given them the time<br />\nto plan projects that will be<br />\nspaceborne soon.<br />\nA review of 1987 would not be<br />\ncomplete without a mention of the<br />\nseparation of the Binder Siamese<br />\ntwins at the Hopkins Hospital last<br />\nsummer. Patrick and Benjamin<br />\nBinder were born connected at<br />\nthe back of their heads, and it<br />\ntook a team of over 70 physicians, nurses, and assistants to<br />\nperform a grueling 22-hour<br />\noperation to separate them. It was<br />\nHopkins' first Siamese twins<br />\nseparation operation in five years,<br />\nand was by all accounts a success,<br />\ngaining Hopkins national<br />\nreknown for the difficult procedure. Latest word was that the<br />\n<br />\nA part of the Space Telescope Institute, which will see many of its projects come to fruition in '88.<br />\n<br />\nHope for heart attack victims<br />\nby Volney Sheen<br />\nA study by Johns Hopkins<br />\nphysicians has determined that<br />\nheart attack patients may beneifit<br />\nfrom a combined use of tPA/Angioplasty. Such a two-step<br />\ntherapy appears to be more effective than either the balloon<br />\nangioplasty or tissue plasminogen<br />\nactivator (t-PA)alone and can be<br />\ninitiated in virtually all hospitals<br />\nwith a well-equipped emergency<br />\nroom or any ambulance with a<br />\nwell-trained crew.<br />\nA heart attack occurs when a<br />\nblood vessel on the surface of the<br />\nheart becomes clotted, thus<br />\ndepriving the organ of an oxygen<br />\nsupply. T-PA dissolves the clots<br />\nthat block coronary arteries and,<br />\nif administered shortly after the<br />\nappearance of symptoms, can<br />\nsave the patient from more extensive damage by allowing at least<br />\nsome trickr, of blood to flow<br />\nthrough the heart. The second<br />\nprocedure would then require use<br />\nof PTCA, or balloon angioplasty, whereby the cardiologist<br />\nwould maneuver a tiny balloon<br />\ninto a coronary arterty and<br />\nrepeatedly inflate and deflate it to<br />\nflatten the clot or other material<br />\nagainst the inside wall of the<br />\n<br />\nvessel, opening it to increase<br />\nblood flow.<br />\nUse of angioplasty alone often<br />\nentails several disadvantages. An<br />\nopen operating room must be<br />\nstanding by in case the balloon<br />\nwere to pop; such a case is always<br />\npossible as the artery has<br />\npresumably been weakened under<br />\nits current condition. Angioplasty may also deprive, though temporarily, the blood flow to the<br />\nheart; and again this merely aggravates the heart in its weakened state.<br />\n\"Use of t-PA results ih improved left ventricular function at<br />\nrest and during exercise and is a<br />\nform of care that can be initiated<br />\nin any hospital in the U.S.<br />\nwithout delay or need for<br />\nemergency transport,\" Alan<br />\nGuerci, M.D., says, adding that<br />\npatients then can be transferred to<br />\ncenters capable of performing<br />\nangioplasty.<br />\nThe study taken at Hopkins involved 138 patients who were initially given placebo or t-PA.<br />\nThose who still had at least a 70<br />\npercent narrowing of the coronary artery after three days were<br />\nrandomly assigned to angioplasty or no angioplasty. The amount<br />\nof blood being pumped by the<br />\n<br />\ntwins are doing just fine.<br />\nHonorable mention goes to the<br />\nscientists at the Medical Institutions and APL for making the<br />\nlives of patients a little easier in<br />\n1987. It was the year that<br />\ndiabetics could have insulin given<br />\nto them by an implanted device<br />\nand persons suffering from certan neural disorders could have<br />\npackets of hormones internally<br />\nadministered to correct their conditions. Numerous other<br />\ndevelopments were also announced by JHMI last year, and all are<br />\nsure many will follow this year.<br />\nThis last year, of course, saw<br />\nsome very interesting advances<br />\nthat make one wonder at the<br />\nabilities of modern science. For<br />\nall the inventions and discovery,<br />\nhowever, the problems of the<br />\nmodern world seem to multiply as<br />\nthe years go on. Hopefully 1988<br />\nwill bring some answers to those<br />\nproblems, or at least a faint clue<br />\nthat might lead to a better life for<br />\nall of us.<br />\n<br />\nHopkins<br />\nScience in Brief<br />\n<br />\nheart increased in the group given<br />\nt-PA but fell in those who did not<br />\nreceive such a treatment.

Neither matches'<br />\nresults came as a surprise to the<br />\nplayers or to Coach Goodyear.<br />\nFranklin and Marshall this year<br />\nis ranked among the top five in<br />\nthe nation while Haverford's program is young and less experienced than Hopkins'.<br />\nThe results from Lancaster, PA<br />\n<br />\n(F&M) were as follows: Senior<br />\nco-captain Lisa Roy lost 15-6,<br />\n15-11, 15-8 to Lee Belknap.<br />\nPlaying number two for the Jays<br />\nwas senior Julie Heaney who lost<br />\nto Carol Gould 15-4, 15-3, 15-2.<br />\nBoth Lisa and Julie played difficult matches against F&M's<br />\nnumber one and number two<br />\nplayers, perhaps ranked among<br />\nthe top collegians in the country.<br />\nJunior Chris Emmick was<br />\ndefeated 15-11, 15-8, 15-3 and<br />\njunior Alice Collins, who has<br />\nrecently returned from a semester<br />\nabroad in Austria, fell 15-7, 15-9,<br />\n15-5. Number six player senior<br />\nIn-hei Hahn was bested 15-6,<br />\n15-11, 15-8.

One<br />\nsetback was that senior Danya<br />\nNiedzwiedzki, the other cocaptain, was sidelined with an injury suffered during Intersession.<br />\nIt is hoped that she will be able<br />\nto play at this weekend's Howe<br />\nCup at Yale. The match was further complicated by the fact that<br />\nHopkins did not carry a full roster<br />\nthat day. Junior Kathy Hart and<br />\nsenior Marlene Schwaeber, two<br />\nimportant figures in the middle of<br />\nthe ladder, were unable to participate, and the Jays had to<br />\nforfeit two of the matches. Coach<br />\nGoodyear remarked that Franklin<br />\nand Marshall was \"better certainly\" but that \"we held our own\"<br />\nand \"had nothing to be ashamed<br />\nof.\" Goodyear was \"satisfied\"<br />\nwith the performances that day,<br />\nconsidering that the Jays were<br />\n\"understaffed\" and faced such a<br />\nstrong Diplomat squad. His comments on Lisa Roy's play were<br />\nespecially positive. \"She played<br />\nas well as I've ever seen her<br />\nplay...she's in control of her<br />\ngame. I'm expecting she'll do<br />\nvery well at Howe Cup.\"<br />\nAt Haverford the action was all<br />\nHopkins. Lisa Roy handed Polly<br />\nO'Sell of Bryn Mawr a 3-0 loss.<br />\nChris Emmick won 3-1 and<br />\nMarlene Schwaeber at number<br />\nthree beat her opponent 3-1.<br />\nAlice Collins dealt a 3-0 loss to<br />\nTerry Jablonski and In-hei Hahn<br />\ncrushed her opponent 3-0.<br />\nKathryn Ng won 3-0 and Laura<br />\nGaffney finished the match with<br />\na 3-0 victory.<br />\nThe Haverford match was an<br />\nego-booster for the Jays, who<br />\nnow enter into the most challenging part of the season. This<br />\nweekend's Howe Cup (Friday 5th<br />\nto Sunday 7th) is not just an important tournament, it is THE<br />\nEVENT of the season. The best<br />\nplayers and teams in the nations<br />\nwill be vying for the top honors.<br />\nLast year Hopkins was second in<br />\ntheir division behind Wesleyan.<br />\nSince all of Coach Goodyear's<br />\nsquad is back with the exception<br />\nof Laura Newcomer, who<br />\ngraduated early, the outlook is<br />\noptimistic. If Hopkins can<br />\nmanage to stay healthy for the<br />\nnext few days and all the players<br />\nperform at their confident best,<br />\n\"we should be challenging for the<br />\ntop position.\"<br />\n<br />\n\fIFIDEDDEIGIDEIDOODOODOODIDODEJODDRA<br />\nIll<br />\n<br />\n0<br />\n<br />\nII<br />\n101<br />\nIll<br />\n111<br />\nMI<br />\nMI<br />\n<br />\nEli<br />\nEli<br />\nEli<br />\n0<br />\n0<br />\n0<br />\n1224733<br />\n0<br />\n0<br />\nEli<br />\n<br />\nii<br />\n<br />\nEli\u2022<br />\nEli<br />\nEli<br />\n<br />\nIll<br />\nEli<br />\nEli<br />\n<br />\nf<br />\nMedium<br />\nCrust<br />\nThin<br />\nCheese<br />\nPizzas<br />\n<br />\nor<br />\n2<br />\n$7.99<br />\n<br />\nI\u00e1l<br />\n<br />\nIJ<br />\n<br />\nEli<br />\n<br />\nEli<br />\n<br />\nOne coupon per party per visit<br />\n<br />\nEli<br />\n<br />\nEli<br />\nIll<br />\n<br />\nIll<br />\nEli<br />\n<br />\nadd toppings for<br />\n.50 per pizza<br />\nper topping<br />\n<br />\nEli<br />\n<br />\no00onnoo0o00<br />\n<br />\nLLLVI1LLL LLUEL<br />\n<br />\nEli<br />\nEli<br />\nEli<br />\nEl<br />\n<br />\n0<br />\n<br />\nC<br />\n<br />\n0<br />\n<br />\n0<br />\n<br />\nLIMINUIMILE OCJO<br />\n0<br />\n0<br />\n0<br />\n<br />\n(Students Against Multiple Sclerosis)<br />\n<br />\nOrgcnizctioncl Veeting:<br />\nFooruc7 10, 7:00 an,<br />\nin tno SAC 0-1c<br />\n<br />\nEli<br />\n<br />\nEli<br />\nIi<br />\nEli<br />\n<br />\no o0o 0000000000o0000000000<br />\n<br />\nEli<br />\n<br />\nEli<br />\n<br />\nExpires 2/14/88<br />\n<br />\nNEWS-LETTER/27<br />\n00000000000000o0<br />\n<br />\nAll Union 3ocrc memoers, SAVS<br />\nmemoers, & IFC memoers, cs<br />\nwell cs the genercl stucent oocy<br />\ncre invitec to cttenc<br />\n<br />\n0<br />\n<br />\n0<br />\n<br />\n0<br />\n0<br />\n0<br />\n0<br />\n<br />\n0<br />\n0<br />\n0<br />\n0<br />\n<br />\nAny bands or DJ's interested in*<br />\n*performing should also attend*<br />\nThe cance will oe Varch 11 & 12<br />\nin the ROTC oullcing<br />\n<br />\nEli<br />\nli<br />\n<br />\n3215 N.

Beginning with this lecture,<br />\nthe Noyce Peace Endowment hopes to fund<br />\na continuing program of courses *and lectures on peace.<br />\nThe Noyce Peace Endowment, under the<br />\nauspice of the Chaplain's Office, has been<br />\nrecently established and is in need of funds.<br />\nIn asking for contributions, Chaplain Gretchen van Utt noted that none of the funds<br />\nare invested in defense-related businesses<br />\nor compaines having dealing with South<br />\nAfrica.<br />\nMcCarthy stressed the need to translate<br />\ncriticism of the existing situation into action. \"We liberals have to go beyond<br />\ngroaning and whining about this Pharaoh<br />\nwho's running our country,\" he remarked. \"In our last eight years, we've been<br />\non a high because of Reagan.<br />\n\"We go out and write Congress about<br />\nthe MX missile and maybe march across<br />\nthe country and feel good about it,\" he<br />\nsaid. \"The press will try to cover it all,<br />\nand you're on the evening news. But then<br />\nit's done, and it's still the same as<br />\nbefore. .<br />\nMcCarthy's solution to the dilemma is<br />\nto \"go into the schools\" and teach. His<br />\ncareer in teaching began five years ago<br />\nwith an invitation from a local public high<br />\nschool to teach journalism. He decided to<br />\nteach about peace instead. McCarthy has<br />\ngone on to teach at the University of<br />\nMaryland, Georgetown University, and<br /><br />\nelsewhere.<br />\nMcCarthy believes that the first step in<br />\nachieving world peace is to make<br />\nAmerica's youth aware of the ideas of<br />\npacifism. He sees an American society<br />\npreoccupied with success and personal<br />\ngain, and not with cooperation. In his<br />\nview, the public has been conditioned to<br />\naccept war as inevitable and to condone<br />\nmass killings and destruction.<br />\n\"I've had about a thousand students,\"<br />\nhe said. \"I have found that they're hungry<br />\nfor more.\" Currently, McCarthy heads the<br />\nCenter for Teaching Peace and is an instructor in private and public high schools<br />\nin the Washington area.<br />\nCritics have accused McCarthy of nullifying his goals by accepting federal funds.<br />\n\"Many in the peace movement do not want<br /><br />\nto go near the system,\" he said. \"The<br />\n, grants aren't as pure as (they) like.\"<br />\nMcCarthy said he must work within the<br />\nsystem to change it. He designed his program to offer an alternative to the Pentagon's Reserve Officers' Training Corps<br />\n(ROTC). McCarthy noted that there are<br />\nfifty campuses in America offering peace<br />\nstudies as a discipline, compared to 1,200<br />\noffering ROTC, such as Hopkins.<br />\n\"They [students in ROTC] are not in<br />\nthere because they want to go shoot people in Grenada, but because it's the only<br />\nwas to make it through college.\" According to McCarthy, additional economic<br />\npressure to deny pacifism has been placed<br />\non today's student, in addition to the<br />\nfact that the Reagan administration has<br />\nattempted to cut funding for all twenty stu-<br /><br />\ndent loan programs.<br />\nMcCarthy believed that the force of<br />\npacifism is just as effective as the force of<br />\narms in trying to \"change what the other<br />\nperson, other country, other government<br />\nthinks.\" He stressed that pacifists defend<br />\nthemselves with the force of ideas just as<br />\nwell as the person using his fists.<br />\nOn the other hand, he remarked, \"It is<br />\nmuch easier to teach Linear Physics speaking in Arabic than the concept of nonviolence.\" Faced with numerous obstacles<br />\nto overcome, from lack of funding to the<br />\npublic's widespread ignorance, McCarthy<br />\nadmits the possibility of defeat for<br />\npacifism.<br />\nQuoting singer Joan Baez, though, he<br />\nsaid, \"Nonviolence will always be less of<br />\na flop than violence.\"<br /><br />\nTHE CHRONICLE<br /><br />\nPell Grant program short of money<br />\nCopyright 1988, The Chronicle ofHigher<br />\nEducation.

The Office of<br />\nResidential Life has considerable input<br />\nunder the present system, albeit informal. The dejure concessions to the administration in the proposal largely entail formalizing its input into the selection process.<br />\nSo what's wrong? If the students still<br />\nbasically run the show, and the program<br />\nstands to be improved by salaried positions, what's the problem?<br />\nA first instinctual reaction is that<br />\nnothing is broken, so there should be no<br />\ngreat desire to fix it. A committee<br />\nestablished last year by Dean Colombo<br />\nto examine Orientation concluded that<br />\nHopkins' program is \"top notch and<br /><br />\nsuccessfully addresses the concerns of<br />\nstudents in transition.\" Yet it goes on<br />\nto assert that \"providing stipends is<br />\nessential if Orientation is to continue to<br />\nattract...highly qualified student<br />\nleaders.\" The concern hardly seems<br />\njustified, unless it was the committee's<br />\nopinion that the quality of the chairmen<br />\nhas been declining.<br />\nPerhaps something is intimidating<br />\nabout formalizing the control the administration would have over the program. Granted, the proposal calls for a<br />\ntrial year, so if non-student control was<br />\noppressive, the system could be returned to its present one. But how will that<br />\nline of \"too oppressive\" be determined, and even if it is \"too oppressive\"<br />\nwould the chairmen mind, as long as the<br />\npay is good?<br />\nSomething larger looms in the<br />\nbackground of the policy change. Orientation is a student activity, regardless of<br />\nsome clear distinctions between it and<br />\nother student activities. By crossing the<br />\nline of renumerating student extracurricular work the principle of recognizing the importance of a well-rounded<br />\neducation is tarnished. More needs to<br />\nbe done here to encourage diversity of<br />\nactivity for its own value; students don't<br />\nneed the added pressure of evaluating<br />\ntheir own positions in terms of whether<br />\nor not the University deems that they are<br />\nworthy of getting paid for it.<br /><br />\nDon't sqwelch the Welch<br />\nat Homewood<br />\nThis week the resignation of Dean of<br />\nHomewood Schools Administration<br />\nRobert Welch was announced. Welch<br />\nsaid that he has completed the jobs he<br />\nwas hired to do, and is moving on to<br />\nfurther his career.<br />\nWelch came to Hopkins in 1985 to fill<br />\nthe newly-created position of dean of<br />\nHomewood Schools; his responsibilities<br />\nwere to focus upon admissions, financial aid, student amenities, and housing.<br />\nAdministrators within these areas would<br />\nreport directly to him.<br />\nOf the many improvements made during Welch's administration, perhaps his<br />\ngreatest contribution was his active support of the expression of student concerns on campus. A close look at the<br />\nHuman Climate Task Force Report,<br />\nreleased last fall, reflects his efforts and<br />\nachieverr-rit. That a strong student<br /><br />\nvoice speaks out is to his credit; that<br />\ndefinite improvements remain show the<br />\ndirection of his continuing work.<br />\nThose who know Welch personally<br />\nbelieve he has a real understanding of<br />\nstudents' needs. He has listened long<br />\nand hard to students, and knows how to<br />\naddress their concerns with swiftness<br />\nand efficacy. Having arrived at Hopkins<br />\nfrom the University of Massachusetts,<br />\na large school quite different from<br />\nHopkins, it is remarkable that Welch<br />\nwas able to come to appreciate student<br />\nlife here in such a short time.<br />\nIt is difficult to watch such a talented,<br />\nconcerned man leave our community.<br />\nWe hope that the Administration, in<br />\nchoosing his successor, will keep in<br />\nmind Welch's goals and act<br />\naccordingly.<br /><br />\nAh, Rush Week\u2014the time<br />\nwhen<br />\nmemories,<br />\nalbeit<br />\nfragmented memories, are made.<br />\nAs grandparents, this year's participants will someday shock the<br />\npants off of Junior with their<br />\nnever-forgotten, oft-embellished<br />\nstories of Japanese beer and<br />\nKamikaze attacks on babes and<br />\nbeefcakes.

Many native<br />\nBaltimoreans would not agree with you, and lately a few have been<br />\nshowing it in a big way. Over the last two or three years, Baltimore<br />\nhas been gaining on New York and Miami in terms of the number<br />\nof camera crews sent here, both for the movies and television.<br />\nThis past weekend alone, as I decided to stretch my legs and walk<br />\ndown to the harbor, I passed a commotion of people, trucks,<br />\npolicemen, and tied-up traffic as a film crew worked on filming<br />\nBaltimore native Ann Tyler's The Accidental Tourist, starring William<br />\nHurt. Had I hung around, I probably could have been in the movie<br />\nas part of the crowd, but the policeman I talked to didn't think so\"meone waving to the camera and shouting, \"Hi Mom!\" would be<br />\nappropriate, so I moved on.<br />\nA few months ago, Whoopi Goldberg was up at one of the private<br />\ngrade schools\u2014Gilman, I believe\u2014filming another movie whose name<br />\nI cannot recall. A friend of mine said she saw Whoopi walking around<br />\ndown at the Harbor. She asked her, \"Are you Whoopi Goldberg?\"<br />\nand the woman replied, \"No, I'm not Whoopi Goldberg,\" and her<br />\ntwo bodyguards said, \"No, she's not Whoopi Goldberg.\"<br />\nMany movies that people have seen and loved already have been<br />\nfilmed here. Most notable of these are Bedroom Window, Diner, Tin<br />\nMen, and Blood Circus. Well, maybe Blood Circus wasn't such a<br />\nhit, but it was fun for the people in the audience during filming. Watching Diner and Tin Men here was also entertaining, as every few<br />\nminutes at least one person in the audience would shout gleefully,<br />\n\"I know that place!\" and \"Hey, that's where we are\u2014Westview<br />\nTheater!\" One of my campers one summer went to the filming of<br />\nBedroom Window and got paid double what I was being paid as a<br />\ncounselor to be part of a crowd.<br />\nBaltimore's television triumphs aren't quite as great, but they're<br />\nthere. Anyone remember The Ellen Burstyn Show? It didn't do that<br />\nwell, running for only a few weeks, and it wasn't actually filmed in<br />\nBaltimore, but that's where it took place, and the outside shot of the<br />\nhouse in the beginning of the show was taken in Pikesville, Northwest<br />\nBaltimore County. Slightly more impressive was this New Year's bash<br />\non PBS filmed at the Baltimore Symphony Orchestra's Meyerhoff<br />\nSymphony Hall and Ethel's Place. This gala would have been a large<br />\nproject for a major network, but for PBS it was amazing, featuring<br />\nthe likes of Harry Anderson, Mel Torme, and our own David Zinrnan.<br />\nSo next time you think Baltimore is less exciting than Hicktown,<br />\nPennsylvania where at least you can have fun cow-tipping, maybe<br />\nyou should look again, a little harder.

I am particularly curious how Lee would<br />\naddress South African brutality<br />\nagainst blacks.

Lee makes his most<br />\nassinine comments in reference to<br />\nGaza. He states that \"Israelis in<br />\nGaza by necessity, not by<br />\nchoice\"?

Cheap labor from Gaza<br /><br />\nis what keeps the Israeli economy<br />\ngoing because most Israelis are<br />\nnot interested in \"Arab work.\"<br />\nWhat Lee has to comprehend is<br />\nthat these people, the Palestinians, are not just a bunch of<br />\nhooligans who have nothing better to do. Rather, these people are<br />\nfed up Israeli occupation and<br />\nIsraeli brutality. These people are<br />\ntired of discrimination, sick of<br />\nhaving to carry identity cards, fed<br />\nup with economic stagnation due<br />\nto Israeli laws and frustrated with<br />\nviolations of their human rights<br />\nand human dignity.

If you take advantage<br />\nof the extermination service (even<br />\nrequest additional exterminations,<br />\nif necessary), faithfully use Combat, and keep a can of Raid or DCon handy in the warmer<br />\nweather, the little buggies won't<br />\nbother you so much\u2014and they go<br />\naway, for the most part, in colder weather.

In<br />\nAugust, September, and late<br />\nMay, it will often feel hotter indoors than out. It is possible to<br />\nget box air conditioners installed,<br />\nbut it's expensive; it's also not<br />\npracticle to do a whole apartment.<br /><br />\nBring a big fan and the faith that<br />\nthe heat waves will end (they<br />\nalways do). The flip side of this<br />\nis, however, that it's nearly impossible to get cold in Wolman in<br />\nthe wintertime.<br />\nSpeaking of warmth, hot water<br />\n(or lack thereof, to be more<br />\nspecific) is occasionally a problem, but is usually quickly corrected. Also, some sink and<br />\nbathtub drains are slow to drain,<br />\nbut again, maintenance is willing<br />\nto help if you ask.<br />\nThe cost of renting apartments<br />\nat Wolman Hall starts at $2265<br />\nfor 9 months for a small, singlebedroom unit for two students<br />\nwith living room, bedroom, kitchen, and bath, and goes up to<br />\n$3805 for 9 months for a single<br />\nefficiency with combination living/bedroom, kitchen unit, and<br />\nbath. There are various options<br />\navailable for two-student shares,<br />\nas well as three-, four- and fivestudent suites and single<br />\naccommodations.<br />\nIn closing, the biggest thing to<br />\nrecommend Wolman hall is its<br />\nconvenience, from both location<br />\nand payment/one-bill expenditure<br />\nstandpoints.

The Charles<br />\nalso boasts some of the highest<br />\nrental rates around. Students can<br />\nexpect to pay between $300 and<br />\n$400 per month per person, for<br />\naccomodations ranging from oneroom efficiencies to two-bedroom<br />\napartments. Residents must pay<br />\nfor their own utilities, but heat<br />\nand hot water are included in the<br />\nrent. It must be noted, however,<br /><br />\nthat The Charles' prices compare<br />\nfavorably with housing of the<br />\nsame proximity to campus, including University housing.<br />\nThe Charles is one of the older<br />\nbuildings around, and lacks many<br />\nof the creature comforts that the<br />\nhigh prices warrant. There is no<br />\ntrash chute, so residents must take<br />\ntheir garbage down to the basement. This is not such an inconvenience, when (if) the<br />\nelevator is in operation. The<br />\nelevator breaks down on the<br />\naverage of once every two weeks,<br />\nand if you're lucky, someone will<br />\nbe working the service elevator.<br />\nIf not, get used to lots of exercise.<br />\nThe management is currently<br />\nrefurbishing the elevator, but it<br />\nremains to be seen whether the<br />\n`new' elevator will be an improvement.

However, the laundry<br />\nroom is in the basement,<br />\ntherefore your plans are subject<br />\nto the whims of the elevator,<br />\nbecause it can be difficult to carry<br />\nyour clothes up and down many<br />\nflights of stairs.

If it were<br />\na review I would say how great<br />\nthe plays were on Friday and<br />\nSaturday night. Since it's not a<br />\nreview, though, I won't say that.<br />\nThat's what this is not. What<br />\nthis is is an attempt to answer all<br />\nthose people who ask me and<br />\neveryone else who was involved<br />\nin the shows, \"What's it like to<br />\nwork with Edward Albee?\"<br />\nIt is understandable that they<br />\nask. After all, working with<br />\nAlbee is probably the most impressive-sounding thing I've done<br />\nat Hopkins. It is a real status symbol. But apart from wowing people with his name and reputation,<br />\njust what does this worldrenowned playwright bring to the<br />\nHopkins community?<br />\nFunny you should ask that.<br /><br />\nWe who work with Edward<br />\nAlbee have been wondering too.<br />\nIt is a major topic of conversation<br />\nevery year. And there are always<br />\ndisagreements on the real *educational usefulness of the program.<br />\nThat's the locker-room talk, in<br />\ncase you ever wondered.<br />\nPart of the problem is that<br />\nevery year the degree of Albee's<br />\ninvolvement with the show<br />\nchanges. In my sophomore year,<br />\nwhen I became involved in the<br />\nshows for the first time, Albee<br />\nwas almost invisible. I saw him<br />\nat the audition and then not again<br />\nuntil the cast party. I'm not certain that I ever even spoke to him<br />\nthat year. As far as I could tell,<br />\nhe was this luminary figure that<br />\nlent his name and aura to the program and beyond that not much<br />\nmore.<br />\nWait, no, actually he did come<br />\nin one time that year and tell us<br />\nthat the playwright was God.<br /><br />\nThen he smiled beneath his saltand-pepper moustache (sort of<br />\nmysteriously, it seemed to me at<br />\nthe time), tossed his scarf over his<br />\nshoulder and left.<br />\nJunior year was an entirely different story. Albee directed each<br />\nof the six plays. The plays<br />\nrehearse Monday through Friday<br />\nfor an hour and a half apiece. Six<br />\nplays meant that Albee was putting in a 9 hour day. It was not<br />\nuntil about two weeks into the<br />\nshow that he relinquished some of<br />\nhis power to the anxiously<br />\nwaiting assistant directors. These<br />\nstudents then took over conducting the rehearsals of an already<br />\nblocked show. Albee showed up<br />\na couple times a week.<br />\nThat was the best year to be an<br />\nactor or a playwright. Albee<br />\ndemanded our best work and we<br />\ngave it to him. His direction<br />\ntaught me a lot about how to take<br />\na written play and make it work<br /><br />\nSpinal Tap).

They look a little tired but<br />\nwhat do you expect? They're<br />\nhalfway through their east coast<br />\ntour, heading south, and they<br />\ndidn't get to bed until six in the<br />\nmorning. Still, the music doesn't<br /><br />\nsuffer much. No, they are not the<br />\nsort of fellows who scissor kick<br />\ntheir way through a gig but what<br />\ndoes that really have to do with<br />\nthe music?<br />\nAh, yes, the music. \"What do<br />\nthey sound like?\" was a question<br />\nI got asked by just about<br />\neverybody I talked to before the<br />\nshow. \"Well, they're. . . rock<br />\nand roll. You know, guitar, bass,<br />\nand drums,\" I would say. It's<br />\ntrue but it's not the whole story.<br />\nAccording to the band's bio, they<br />\nwere around, in slightly different<br />\nform, during the \"halcyon days\"<br />\nof early punk. And it shows,<br />\nespecially on some of their more<br />\nraucous numbers. The quick tempo changes from the verse to the<br />\nchorus, the mantric quality of the<br />\nchord changes, and the abrasive<br />\ntexture of the instrumentation<br />\n(though few punks back then had<br />\nMarshall stacks), are all<br />\ntrademarks of such bands as<br />\nTelevision, and, more recently,<br />\nDie Kreuzen. Unlike many of<br />\ntheir predecessors, however,<br />\nAngst plays a full range of songs,<br />\nslower, more gentle. Their roots<br />\nare clearly in rock and blues<br />\nmusic, though they occasionally<br />\nfind themselves in jazz-like territory. All in all, they are varied<br />\nand expressive enough to keep the<br />\nlistener's interest throughout their<br />\ntwo forty-five minute sets.<br />\nTragically, as is often the case at<br />\nHopkins, other events the same<br />\nevening prevent anything more<br />\nthan a token turnout.

The actors<br />\nwould shrug in assent. It worked.<br />\nThe difficulty that year was that<br />\nthe assistant directors didn't get<br />\nenough of a chance to direct.<br />\nThey spent most of the time<br />\nobserving or taking care of the<br />\ndrudgery. Albee did the fun stuff.<br />\nStill, I think we all at least got to<br />\nsee the artist at work.<br />\nThis year Albee swung the<br />\nother way again. He showed up<br />\nsometimes and made great suggestions, but didn't really play a<br />\nconstant role. He directed only<br />\none of the six plays this year<br />\nbecause there was a no-show student director. The other plays<br />\nwere pretty much on their own.<br />\nIn many ways, this worked to our<br />\nadvantage.<br />\nAlthough Albee had given us<br />\nall a speech about the chain of<br />\ncommand (according to which the<br />\nactor and the playwright can only communicate through the<br />\ndirector), in my play we soon<br />\nthrew caution to the wind and had<br />\ngroup discussions about the play.<br />\nSometimes these got messy. Toes<br />\nwere probably stepped on. But<br />\nheck, we all learned a helluvalot<br />\nabout what the other people in the<br />\nshow were going through. There<br />\nwas a real sense of a common<br />\ngoal. We were all working<br />\ntogether to make this play the best<br />\nit possibly could be.<br />\nTalking to other people in other<br />\nshows I realize that each play<br />\ncontributed to a different kind of<br />\nexperience. I believe this year,<br />\nmore than any other, the shows<br />\ncame together. That is to say that<br />\nin years past you worked with<br />\nyour own play in your own time<br />\nslot and never got much of a<br />\nchance to see or speak to anyone<br />\nfrom another show. Because<br />\nsome of the shows had extra-large<br />\ncasts this year, there was a lot of<br /><br />\ninteraction.<br />\nAlbee showed up once in<br />\nawhile this year to make sure we<br />\nwere on the right track.<br />\nSometimes he would come in for<br />\nonly a few minutes and fix<br />\nsomething in the show that we<br />\nknew was a problem but didn't<br />\nknow how to solve. There'd be<br />\nthis feeling of\"A-ha, why didn't<br />\nI think of that.\" And you'd know<br />\nthat next time we would think of<br />\nthat. We had learned.<br />\nI had the feeling that if we had<br />\nreally needed his help he would<br />\nhave been there. With this safety<br />\nnet beneath us we were all able<br />\nto take some risks on our own.<br />\nWe pretty much did it ourselves.<br />\nJudging from the number of<br />\npeople who auditioned for these<br />\nshows and from the number of<br />\npeople who attended them, there is<br />\nan overwhelming demand for<br />\nquality theater on campus. The<br />\nBarnstormers make great strides<br />\nevery year, but they are students<br />\nfighting an unfriendly system. A<br />\nman with pull like Edward Albee<br />\ncan get things done administratively here that students<br />\ncannot. The rededication of the LV Room in Professor Arellano's<br />\nmemory is one example of<br />\nsomething that we all wanted to<br />\ndo. Albee just met with President<br />\nMuller and it was as good as<br />\ndone. If Hopkins has this much<br />\nrespect for Albee and he is a man<br />\nof the theater, then why don't<br />\nthey have as much respect for the<br />\nstudents interested in theater here<br />\nat Hopkins?<br />\nA student with such \"artsy\" interests could develop a real confidence problem here in the land<br />\nof practicality. And that brings us<br />\nto the best thing about working<br />\nwith Albee. He is a successful artist. This phrase has become an<br />\noxymoron here at Hopkins. Albee<br />\nintroduces a concept otherwise<br />\nforeign to Hopkins. It's OK to<br />\nwant to be an artist. You may<br />\neven succeed.<br /><br />\nAn entertaining<br />\nGood Morning Vietnam<br />\nby Sandrine Tiller<br />\nGood Morning Vietnam is a fun<br />\nmovie. It takes place in the early<br />\n60's in Saigon, and tells the (true)<br />\nstory of a disc jockey for the<br />\nArmed Forces network who<br />\nbecame extremely popular with<br />\nthe troops. The film starts with<br />\nthe broadcast before the new disc<br />\njockey (Robin Williams) arrives.<br />\nThis disc jockey sounds like a<br />\npresident<br />\non<br />\nuniversity<br />\nquaaludes. The radio station is<br />\nmainly populated by straightlaced, crew cut officers. Enter<br />\nRobin Williams, who begins his<br />\nbroadcast with a rousing \"GOOD<br />\nMORNING VIETNAM!\", then<br />\nproceeds to make jokes about<br />\nEthel Merman jamming up Soviet<br />\nradar, fashionable uniforms, and<br />\nthen plays some James Brown.<br />\nThis kind of \"radicalism\" draws<br />\nthe attention of some of his<br />\nsuperiors, who have different notions of humor and want to play<br />\nPerry Como instead of Martha<br />\nand the Vandellas. Williams falls<br />\nin love with a Vietnamese girl,<br /><br />\nteaches her English class, and<br />\nbecomes friends with her brother.<br />\nHe becomes more and more involved in the society there, and<br />\nbegins to notice many inequalities. He defends justice and<br />\nfights censorship. This eventually costs him his job.<br />\nAs previously demonstrated in<br />\nThe World According to Gatp<br />\nand Moscow on the Hudson,<br />\nWilliams is an accomplished actor. He brings a freshness and<br />\ncandor to the screen. He is at his<br />\nbest when he is improvising on<br />\nhis radio show. The military<br />\ncharacters are his foil, and often<br />\nthey seem straight out of<br />\nM*A*S*H. Sometimes the films<br />\nseems a bit too \"eighties-ish\"<br />\nwith the GIs sporting fashionable<br />\nhaircuts.<br />\nThe traditional Vietnam-movie<br />\nmoralizing is toned down and<br />\nsubtle. This makes for an entertaining, easy-viewing movie.<br />\nGood Morning Vietnam is at its<br />\nbest when it unleashes Williams'<br />\ncomic genius.<br /><br />\n20/FEBRUARY 5, 1988<br /><br />\nDream Disc<br /><br />\nThe Flip Side by Phil Gochenour<br />\nby Phil Gochenour<br />\nWell, a good friend of mine<br />\nrecently told me I should be<br />\ncovering more British albums,<br />\nbecause all the really hip stuff<br />\nhere comes from there. This, in<br />\nconjunction with my perusal of<br />\nthe year-end issue of Melody<br />\nMaker(A Brit music mag), convinced me that maybe I should<br />\nlook into some of these British<br />\ngroups. This is mainly because I<br />\nhadn't heard of half the people in<br />\ntheir top ten. So, after scouring<br />\nrecord bins from here to DC, I<br />\nhave come up with some capsule<br />\nreviews of some of the more \"important\" recent British releases.<br />\nThe Young Gods-The Young<br />\nGods (EP). Melody Maker<br />\nlavished just about every praise<br />\non these guys that you could think<br />\nof, not the least of which was the<br />\npronouncement that 'they are the<br />\nfuture.' Pretty bleak looking<br />\nplace, the future. The Young<br />\nGods are three guys with a<br />\nsampler and a drum machine, and<br />\nwhat they construct with these instruments can only be described<br />\nas a percussion track with the occassional (very occassional)<br />\nsampled guitar riff or sound<br />\nlayered in on top. Now, this<br />\ndoesn't sound like much, but the<br />\nend result is one of the densest<br />\nmixes I've ever heard, and god,<br />\nis it brutal. Flying shreds of metal<br />\nmight describe it\u2014pure animal<br />\nfury comes pretty close. Like<br />\nmost of these British releases, this<br />\nis best appreciated when heard on<br /><br />\na dance floor. Only a club sound<br />\nsystem can put this up to the pure<br />\near-bleeding volume it deserves.<br />\nThis is music stripped down to the<br />\nbarest bones of rhythm, which is<br />\nOK for dancing, but I don't<br />\nknow how it would wear over<br />\ntime\u2014thrash seems to be the<br />\nAmerican equivalant, and that<br />\ngets old pretty quick. But, check<br />\nit out for yourself\u2014you might<br />\nfind yourself on the cutting edge<br />\nof the future.<br />\nThe Sisters of Mercy\u2014<br />\nFlood/and. Andrew Eldritch (the<br />\nonly remaining sister since the<br />\nother sisters split to form The<br />\nMission U.K.) seems to have<br />\nlistened to a little too much Iggy<br />\nPop as produced by David<br />\nBowie. He snarls, he growls, he<br />\ndoes his best to live up to a<br />\nsinister Goth image. (Goth is a<br />\nBritish movement that has spawned such groups as The Cult, who<br />\nused to be called Southern Death<br />\nCult. That should tell you what<br />\nthe movement is like.) To a large<br />\ndegree, he succeeds. The music<br />\nis as grandiose as a Wagnerian<br />\nopera, with delicate fillagrees of<br />\nsynth and guitar filling in the upper ranges. (It's no accident that<br />\ntwo of his albums singles were<br />\nproduced by Jim Steinman, who<br />\nmade Meatloaf's Bat Out of Hell<br />\nthe teen opera it is.) It's damn<br />\ndanceable too, with some moves<br />\nthat could reanimate the dead<br />\n(hmmm, makes you wonder,<br />\ngiven where it's coming from.)<br />\nThe real problem is Eldritch's<br />\nvocals. Though he does his best<br /><br />\nto sound menacing, he lacks the<br />\nmaniacal edge of Iggy, who<br />\nalways sounded like a psychopath<br />\nwho was just barely hanging onto his control. This is to the detriment of such songs as \"Flood I\"<br />\nwhich, at slightly over six<br />\nminutes, needs something more<br />\nto keep the tension high. If<br />\nEldritch could learn to keep<br />\nthings short and sweet, and put<br />\nsome expression in his voice, he<br />\ncould have some really powerful<br />\ntunes coming out. Give him some<br />\ntime to age, like rancid cheese.<br />\nSkinny Puppy\u2014Cleanse, Fold,<br />\nand Manipulate. Well, they bill<br />\nthemselves as a 'Performance Art<br />\nGroup,' and the liner notes mention such things as 'aural<br />\nsculpture.' Do not, however,<br />\nassume that this music in any way<br />\nresembles the stuff being put out<br />\nby such labels as Private Music<br />\nand Windham Hill. Try to imagine, if you will, a minor but<br />\nnonetheless malevolent demon<br />\npossessing an entire studio full of<br />\nsynths, samplers, sequencers, and<br />\nother electronic devices. Now,<br />\nput a dance beat to it. That's Skinny Puppy. The music is cut-andpaste sonic salad gleaned from<br />\nsampling, the vocals are all<br />\ngrowled from the bottom of a barrel, and the total effect is that of<br />\nmood music for the chronically<br />\ndepressed. As such, it's pretty<br />\ngood. On any given song there<br />\nare enough things going on to<br />\nkeep you interested, even if you<br />\ncan't hum along.

As His Majesty's treasury became fuller every day, the<br />\nPrincess became lazier. She neither learned the great<br />\nliteratures that the wise men in the court had created, nor<br />\nhelped in other people's activities.

AIDS<br />\nwas the big story in nearly all of<br />\nour nation's big-city hospitals as<br />\nfears mounted when the disease<br />\nspread to even greater numbers of<br />\npeople. Furthermore, last year<br />\nwas a banner year for medicine,<br />\nwith developments ranging from<br />\nheart-lung transplants to the<br />\nevidence that there is something<br />\npeople can do about their<br />\nwrinkles.<br />\nThe stories that broke last year<br />\nfill thousands of pages of our nation's journals and pop-science<br />\nmagazines, and reports of the<br />\nevents at Hopkins hold a hearty<br />\nshare of those publications. Here<br />\nin the Science section, we have<br />\ntried to present the discoveries<br />\nand trends that have been fostered<br />\nand nourished at Hopkins, and we<br />\nthought it would be fun to take a<br />\nlook back to some of the major<br />\narticles and themes that were<br />\ndescribed on these pages. Here,<br />\nthen, are what we feel to be the<br />\nmost important stories of 1987.<br />\nThe top item in 1987 definitely was the continuing AIDS<br />\nepidemic. Inner city hospitals,<br />\nJohns Hopkins included, had to<br />\nprovide for the many patients<br />\nstricken with this relatively new<br />\ndisease that mankind seems<br />\nsomewhat powerless against. As<br />\nresearchers race to find some<br />\nmore clues to the mechanism of<br />\nthe immune disorder, the disease<br />\ncontinues to spread internationally. Although the stream of news<br /><br />\nfrom the country's research<br />\ncenters is almost incessant with<br />\nlittle victories over the disease,<br />\nexperts pessimistically predict<br />\nthat a vaccine and cure for the<br />\ndisease will not be available until at least the start of the next<br />\ncentury.<br />\nExcitement was in the air this<br />\npast summer as scientific sponsors were making pitches at Dr.<br />\nRobert Gallo, a top U.S. researcher of AIDS at the National Institutes of Health, to come up to<br />\nBaltimore from Washington to<br />\nhead his own laboratory with support from Johns Hopkins. The<br />\nsponsors withdrew their support<br />\nthis fall, so Dr. Gallo has decided to remain in Washington to<br />\npursue his own research. That has<br />\nnot stopped Hopkins, however,<br />\nfrom opening its own AIDS<br />\nresearch center at the Hospital<br />\nwith hopes of finding a vaccine<br />\nfor the deadly retrovirus.<br />\nSuperconductors were the second biggest story last year. A<br />\npractically ignored field until just<br />\na few years ago, physicists have<br />\ntaken up the task of finding those<br />\nmaterials that can conduct electricity with extremely small<br />\nresistance. The Nobel Prize in<br />\nPhysics was awarded last year to<br />\ntwo researchers who found a<br />\nceramic material that could superconduct at temperatures that were<br />\nrelatively easy and cheap to maintain. The applications to computers, communications, and<br />\ntrain travel could be enormous.<br />\nResearchers, including a team at<br />\nHomewood, are currently working on trying to make the superconductors in shapes that industries can use\u2014wires and<br />\nsheets, for example. The work is<br />\nnot as easy as it sounds, but once<br />\nit is done many scientists feel that<br />\nthe world will undergo a second<br /><br />\nrevolution in electronics and<br />\ncreate the next generation of<br />\ncomputers.<br />\nAnother big story of the year<br />\nwas one we had little information<br />\nabout\u2014the Mind-Brain Institute<br />\nthat has been planned for<br />\nHomewood. Designed to be a<br />\nplace where researchers in<br />\nneuroscience, psychology,<br />\nphilosophy, and biophysics could<br />\nget together and investigate the<br />\nburgeoning field of our human<br />\nbrains and how they are different<br />\nfrom or connected to our minds.<br />\nAlready in the planning stages,<br />\nwith their headquarters located in<br />\nJenkins Hall, the Institute will<br />\neventually be housed in a building<br />\noff San Martin Drive, south of the<br />\nAthletic Center. Projected date of<br />\nthe completion of the facilities is<br />\nin the early 1990's.<br />\nAlso on San Martin Drive, the<br />\nSpace Telescope Institute is nearly doubling its office space in<br />\npreparation of the restart of space<br />\nshuttle flights later on this year.<br />\nThe Challenger disaster two years<br /><br />\nago was a devastating blow to<br />\nHopkins, as projects being<br />\ndeveloped by the Space Telescope<br />\nInstitute such as the HUT<br />\n(Hutzler Ultraviolet Telescope)<br />\nhad to be delayed indefinitely until NASA could ensure safe<br />\nflights into space. 1987 was a lean<br />\nyear for the STI, but hopefully<br />\nthe year has given them the time<br />\nto plan projects that will be<br />\nspaceborne soon.<br />\nA review of 1987 would not be<br />\ncomplete without a mention of the<br />\nseparation of the Binder Siamese<br />\ntwins at the Hopkins Hospital last<br />\nsummer. Patrick and Benjamin<br />\nBinder were born connected at<br />\nthe back of their heads, and it<br />\ntook a team of over 70 physicians, nurses, and assistants to<br />\nperform a grueling 22-hour<br />\noperation to separate them. It was<br />\nHopkins' first Siamese twins<br />\nseparation operation in five years,<br />\nand was by all accounts a success,<br />\ngaining Hopkins national<br />\nreknown for the difficult procedure. Latest word was that the<br /><br />\nA part of the Space Telescope Institute, which will see many of its projects come to fruition in '88.<br /><br />\nHope for heart attack victims<br />\nby Volney Sheen<br />\nA study by Johns Hopkins<br />\nphysicians has determined that<br />\nheart attack patients may beneifit<br />\nfrom a combined use of tPA/Angioplasty. Such a two-step<br />\ntherapy appears to be more effective than either the balloon<br />\nangioplasty or tissue plasminogen<br />\nactivator (t-PA)alone and can be<br />\ninitiated in virtually all hospitals<br />\nwith a well-equipped emergency<br />\nroom or any ambulance with a<br />\nwell-trained crew.<br />\nA heart attack occurs when a<br />\nblood vessel on the surface of the<br />\nheart becomes clotted, thus<br />\ndepriving the organ of an oxygen<br />\nsupply. T-PA dissolves the clots<br />\nthat block coronary arteries and,<br />\nif administered shortly after the<br />\nappearance of symptoms, can<br />\nsave the patient from more extensive damage by allowing at least<br />\nsome trickr, of blood to flow<br />\nthrough the heart. The second<br />\nprocedure would then require use<br />\nof PTCA, or balloon angioplasty, whereby the cardiologist<br />\nwould maneuver a tiny balloon<br />\ninto a coronary arterty and<br />\nrepeatedly inflate and deflate it to<br />\nflatten the clot or other material<br />\nagainst the inside wall of the<br /><br />\nvessel, opening it to increase<br />\nblood flow.<br />\nUse of angioplasty alone often<br />\nentails several disadvantages. An<br />\nopen operating room must be<br />\nstanding by in case the balloon<br />\nwere to pop; such a case is always<br />\npossible as the artery has<br />\npresumably been weakened under<br />\nits current condition. Angioplasty may also deprive, though temporarily, the blood flow to the<br />\nheart; and again this merely aggravates the heart in its weakened state.<br />\n\"Use of t-PA results ih improved left ventricular function at<br />\nrest and during exercise and is a<br />\nform of care that can be initiated<br />\nin any hospital in the U.S.<br />\nwithout delay or need for<br />\nemergency transport,\" Alan<br />\nGuerci, M.D., says, adding that<br />\npatients then can be transferred to<br />\ncenters capable of performing<br />\nangioplasty.<br />\nThe study taken at Hopkins involved 138 patients who were initially given placebo or t-PA.<br />\nThose who still had at least a 70<br />\npercent narrowing of the coronary artery after three days were<br />\nrandomly assigned to angioplasty or no angioplasty. The amount<br />\nof blood being pumped by the<br /><br />\ntwins are doing just fine.<br />\nHonorable mention goes to the<br />\nscientists at the Medical Institutions and APL for making the<br />\nlives of patients a little easier in<br />\n1987. It was the year that<br />\ndiabetics could have insulin given<br />\nto them by an implanted device<br />\nand persons suffering from certan neural disorders could have<br />\npackets of hormones internally<br />\nadministered to correct their conditions. Numerous other<br />\ndevelopments were also announced by JHMI last year, and all are<br />\nsure many will follow this year.<br />\nThis last year, of course, saw<br />\nsome very interesting advances<br />\nthat make one wonder at the<br />\nabilities of modern science. For<br />\nall the inventions and discovery,<br />\nhowever, the problems of the<br />\nmodern world seem to multiply as<br />\nthe years go on. Hopefully 1988<br />\nwill bring some answers to those<br />\nproblems, or at least a faint clue<br />\nthat might lead to a better life for<br />\nall of us.<br /><br />\nHopkins<br />\nScience in Brief<br /><br />\nheart increased in the group given<br />\nt-PA but fell in those who did not<br />\nreceive such a treatment.

One<br />\nsetback was that senior Danya<br />\nNiedzwiedzki, the other cocaptain, was sidelined with an injury suffered during Intersession.<br />\nIt is hoped that she will be able<br />\nto play at this weekend's Howe<br />\nCup at Yale. The match was further complicated by the fact that<br />\nHopkins did not carry a full roster<br />\nthat day. Junior Kathy Hart and<br />\nsenior Marlene Schwaeber, two<br />\nimportant figures in the middle of<br />\nthe ladder, were unable to participate, and the Jays had to<br />\nforfeit two of the matches. Coach<br />\nGoodyear remarked that Franklin<br />\nand Marshall was \"better certainly\" but that \"we held our own\"<br />\nand \"had nothing to be ashamed<br />\nof.\" Goodyear was \"satisfied\"<br />\nwith the performances that day,<br />\nconsidering that the Jays were<br />\n\"understaffed\" and faced such a<br />\nstrong Diplomat squad. His comments on Lisa Roy's play were<br />\nespecially positive. \"She played<br />\nas well as I've ever seen her<br />\nplay...she's in control of her<br />\ngame. I'm expecting she'll do<br />\nvery well at Howe Cup.\"<br />\nAt Haverford the action was all<br />\nHopkins.

This<br />\nweekend's Howe Cup (Friday 5th<br />\nto Sunday 7th) is not just an important tournament, it is THE<br />\nEVENT of the season. The best<br />\nplayers and teams in the nations<br />\nwill be vying for the top honors.<br />\nLast year Hopkins was second in<br />\ntheir division behind Wesleyan.<br />\nSince all of Coach Goodyear's<br />\nsquad is back with the exception<br />\nof Laura Newcomer, who<br />\ngraduated early, the outlook is<br />\noptimistic.
