The official<br />\nguests are invited to join the academic procession at 10 o'clock in<br />\nthe same place.

The<br />\nboxes will be reserved until this<br />\nhour for the families of the trustees and faculty, and the seats on<br />\nthe first floor not required for<br />\nthose in the procession for other<br />\npersons holding cards. After the<br />\nprocession has entered, the remaining seats will be free to the<br />\npublic. A portion of the balcony<br />\nwill also be reserved for ticket<br />\nholders until 10.15 o'clock. The<br />\nexercises will begin punctually at<br />\n10.30 o'clock and will close probably before 12.30. It would seem hardly necessary<br />\nto emphasize the fact that every<br />\nundergraduate is expected to be<br />\npresent at this memorable occasion; for the celebrity of the principal speaker should.constitute in<br />\nitself enough drawing-power even<br />\nwere there ribt the further consideration of college spirit. The<br />\nUni,yersity is 'Certainly fortunate<br />\nin being able to have Herbert C.<br />\nHoover, one of the best-known<br />\nmen in ,the world today, as the<br />\nchief orator at the observation of<br />\nthe forty-fourth anniversary of<br />\nher birth. Needless to say punctuality will be necessary in coming<br />\nto the Lyric. The audience will<br />\nundoubtedly fill the building to<br />\noverflowing despite its size, and so<br />\nto procure a seat within good<br />\nhearing distance, students must<br />\narrive promptly at 9.45.<br />\n<br />\nIn a fast, hard-played game, the<br />\nJohns Hopkins basketeers fell before the onslaughts of the Princeton quintet. The superior physical<br />\ncondition and greater stamina of<br />\nthe Orange and Black told in the<br />\nlong run, for in the first half Hopkins played them to a standstill.<br />\nHowever, when the second period<br />\nwas called, it was plainly evident<br />\nwhat the outcome, which had<br />\nhitherto been uncertain, would be,<br />\nas the local boys showed their exhaustion plainly. Princeton, on<br />\nthe other hand, sent in several<br />\nfresh men and the score piled up.<br />\nThe only thing that marred a<br />\nperfect exhibition of basket-ball<br />\nwas the long shooting on the part<br />\nof Weiner and, to some extent, of<br />\nCuneo. This fault is the one<br />\nwhich Coach Murphy has been<br />\ncombatting throughout the season<br />\nwithout being able to overcome.<br />\nThe first half was replete with<br />\nthrills. Hopkins jumped off at<br />\nthe whistle,. running up three<br />\npoints before Princeton awoke.<br />\nThree fouls on the part of Hopkins followed in quick succession,<br />\ntwo of which Netts put through<br />\nthe hoop. Immediately after,<br />\nNetts scored a difficult goal and<br />\nthe visitors were ahead. Pretty<br />\nteamwork of Flinn and Weiner resulted in a basket and Hopkins<br />\nonce more forged ahead, to hold<br />\nthis lead till near the end of the<br />\nhalf, when Princeton made a rally<br />\nand chalked up four baskets. The<br />\nhalf ended with the Tigers at the<br />\nfat half of a 13-9 score.<br />\nThe second half was a sad affair for Hopkins' supporters.<br />\nPrinceton played all around the<br />\nlocal boys, scoring almost at will.<br />\nNetts had the edge_on Cuneo in<br />\nthe foul shooting, netting six baskets out of nine tries, as opposed<br />\nto three out of seven on the part<br />\nof the Black and Blue guard.<br />\nOn the defensive play, time<br />\nOrange and Black far outshone<br />\nthe local basketeers. When a<br />\nHopkins player got his hands on<br />\nthe ball he was almost invariably<br />\nconfronted by the problem of<br />\nworking the leather through the<br />\nentire Princeton team, while many<br />\ntimes three of the visitors would<br />\ntear down the floor with but one<br />\nBlack and Blue warrior to hinder<br />\nthem.<br />\nIn the preliminary contest, the<br />\nHopkins freshmen had no trouble<br />\nin trouncing the Poly quint to the<br />\ntune of 14-4.

Manager Field has<br />\narranged games with the country's foremost collegiate baseball<br />\nteams, such as Holy Cross, Fordham, I'rinceton, Cornell, Tufts,<br />\netc. Easter week will open the<br />\nseason with an even half dozen<br />\ndiamond battles, the first of which<br />\nwill be with Priceton. Three extensive trips will be made by the<br />\nteam, one to southern climes to<br />\ntackle the University of Virginia<br />\nin her lair, and two northern colleges. The first, of a week's duration, will be undertaken the last<br />\nweek in April, on which excursion<br />\nFordham, Crescents, Columbia<br />\nand Stevens will be met. At present, Manager Fields has only two<br />\ngames on the card for the second<br />\ntrip, which will take place at the<br />\nend of the collegiate year, those<br />\nwith Boston College and Lehigh,<br />\nbut he has negotiations under way<br />\nwith several other universities.<br />\nThat the management feels safe<br />\nin binding the nine to such a rigorous contract seems to be wellgrounded, although nothing certain can be said at this date.<br />\nHowever, everything points to a<br />\nvery successful season, as the entire last year's team, with the exception of Judefind, the star<br />\ntwirler, will be found in uniform<br />\nonce more. Juclefind's place will<br />\nbe well _filled, however, as \"Ted\"<br />\nWelliver and \"Bobby\" Owings, as<br />\nwell as several new candidates,<br />\nwill adorn the mound for the<br />\nBlack and Blue this season. Welliver, it will be remembered, carried off all the pitching honors in<br />\n1918, but last year he contracted<br />\nthe flu and was forced to leave<br />\ncollege. However, he is back this<br />\nseason with bells on. \"Bobby\"<br />\nOwings, too, played in hard luck<br />\nlast year. He hails from Friends<br />\nSchool, on which team he starred<br />\nfor several years, but he was a<br />\nvictim of the blacklist, and was<br />\nunable to don the uniform.<br />\nWallace, a medico, who twirled<br />\nseveral games and led the team<br />\nwith the stick last season, will be<br />\non hand, ready to prove that he,<br />\ntoo, is in a class with Owings and<br />\nWelliver.<br />\nHerbert Armstrong, all-American inter-collegiate third baseman for two years, who has<br />\ncoached City College for several<br />\nyears, will guide the Black and<br />\nBlue through this spring.

Some have given forth<br />\nthe merry guffaw, others have<br />\nshaken their heads sadly at the<br />\nlatest signs of the mental depravity of our wisest and most venerable seekers after knowledge.<br />\nBoth have missed the point of the<br />\nmatter.<br />\nThe real facts are these: By.<br />\n,adopting canes as their private<br />\nmark of fame, the Senior Class is<br />\nforging another link into our<br />\nchain of Hopkins tradition. The<br />\ncane itself has always carried a<br />\ncertain air of distinction. Their<br />\ninfrequency of use at the present<br />\ntime is due perhaps to the rush<br />\nand hurry of the period. Our<br />\nSeniors will have, by then, almost<br />\ncompleted a period of study and of<br />\nstudent activity, and will have<br />\nbecome the leaders of the campus<br />\nlife. The cane will be a most appropriate accompaniment to'their<br />\ndignity.<br />\nThe spirit of an institution of<br />\nlearning, or, as our army circles<br />\nput it, the morale, is directly proportioned to the student traditions.

Morita was a graduate of Tokio University and was<br />\ndoing his second year's work at<br />\nHopkins.<br />\nDr. Livingston, professor of<br />\nplant physiology, considered him<br />\na fine scholar, an indefatigable<br />\nworker and a thorough gentleman,<br />\nand says that he gave great promise of becoming a leader in botanical science. Morita's experimentation was in such shape that Dr.<br />\nLivingston and Mr. H. C. Diehl<br />\nplan to prepare a brief report of<br />\nthe results of his experiments for<br />\npublication in the near future.<br />\nIn the universities of South<br />\nAmerica, subjects are commonly<br />\nstudied only for a professional<br />\nend. The scholar studies natural<br />\nsciences only in the medical school<br />\nfor their bearing on medicine, and<br />\nthe social sciences only in the law<br />\nschool for their bearing on jurisprudence. Hence the universities<br />\ngenerally contain only professional schools without any college of<br />\nliberal arts.<br />\nThe United States is carrying<br />\non two collossal experiments in<br />\neducation. One is to conduct its<br />\nschools largely through the services of unmarried ladies who average three years' teaching before<br />\nthey get married. The second is<br />\nto give education without religion.<br />\nThe United States has yet to prove<br />\nthat it will succeed in either or<br />\nboth of these experiments.\u2014Prof.<br />\nSisson, University of Montana.<br />\n<br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER'S MAILBAG<br />\nA Column in Which the Coriespondents<br />\nAre Allowed Latitude, but Shoulder the Responsibility.<br />\n<br />\nAll letters intended for publication<br />\nmust be concise.<br />\nNo attention will be paid to anonymous letters, but names signed as an<br />\nevidence of good faith will not be printed<br />\nif request is made that they be omitted.<br />\nThe publication of a letter is not to be<br />\ntaken as an indorsement of its views by<br />\nNEws-I,ErrErt, which invites the<br />\nfreest discussion of matters of general<br />\ninterest.<br />\n<br />\nThinks Hopkins is Dying of Dry Pot.<br />\nTo the Editor of THE NEWS-LETTER:<br />\n<br />\nFebruary 14, 1920.<br />\nSir\u2014it was with extreme regret<br />\nthat 1 heard of the resignation of<br />\nDr. Slonimsky from the faculty<br />\nof the Department of Philosophy.<br />\nHelping to solve the greatest probkm before the country today\u2014<br />\nthat of labor\u2014could not but make<br />\na man more capable of bringing to<br />\nhis classes a most valuable point<br />\nof view.<br />\nUniversities have often been accused of being too secluded and<br />\nout of touch with the problems of<br />\nthe world. Philosophy has lost<br />\nmuch of its erstwhile popularity<br />\nbecause it did not come in the<br />\nrealm of \"useful\" studies. And<br />\nso when a professor who is combining practical work with his<br />\nteaching is allowed to resign it<br />\nappears inexcusable.

In BO many periodicals<br />\nof this kind the editorials are so<br />\nperfunctory that they are of little<br />\n\u2022 value. Your editorial on the Kessler petition deserves the commendation of every true Hopkins man.<br />\nE.

He has, therefore,<br />\napplied \u2022 to THE NEWS-LETTER for permis\u2022 sion to preach a sermon in this week's<br />\nissue, and he sincerely hopes and trusts<br />\nthat his efforts will not be in vain. Needless<br />\nto say his request was granted, and we submit for your approval a little talk by the<br />\nRev. George Quack, D. 1).1<br />\n<br />\nBrethren, if you may be termed<br />\nas such, I am going to take may<br />\ntext this morning from the first<br />\nchapter of St. John, twenty-third<br />\nverse, \"the voice of one crying in<br />\nthe wilderness.\" The voice in<br />\nthis case I take to .\u2022 be the poor<br />\nlittle innocent freshman who finds<br />\nhimself deposited in the midst of<br />\na large university, not knowing<br />\nwhich way to turn without encountering a soph's paddle. Just<br />\na bit of advice to ye freshmen from<br />\none who has been through the<br />\nmill and knows, you can't get any<br />\nmore out of college life than you<br />\nput into it. Why, just the other<br />\nday Dr. Gilpin told me that<br />\nGeorge Wagner's kid brother (I<br />\ncan't think of his maiden name<br />\nright now) was in the midst of<br />\nmaking a concoction of silver nitrate by dissolving a dime in<br />\nnitric acid. \"Doc,\" he says, \"I<br />\nhaven't got a dime, will two<br />\nnickels do?\"<br />\nAnd then, freshmen, don't fool<br />\naway your precious hours of study<br />\nby going to the theatre- all the<br />\ntime like Chauncey Wright does.<br />\nThey tell me that he was summoned to his adviser not so long<br />\nago to receive some paternal advice. \"Lemme see your report,.<br />\nMr. Wright,\" said Dr. Gilpin.<br />\n\"Ahem, failed in two subjects,<br />\ndidn't you? Damn pity you didn't<br />\nflunk in three, and then we<br />\nwouldn't have to bother with<br />\nyou.\" Moral, don't do as I do,<br />\ndo as I say should be did.<br />\nIf you really and truly want to<br />\nmake an honest-to-gosh success of<br />\nyour college career commit some<br />\ncrime worthy of publication in my<br />\nworld-beating column. That done,<br />\nyour fame is assured for generations to come; in other words, you<br />\nhave burst into immortal print.<br />\nLike a little crowd of fellows in<br />\nBiology II have passed a bill<br />\nwhich states that the chap who<br />\nreceives the lowest mark in a quiz<br />\nhas to stand treat for the bunch.<br />\nFor the last five times Mr. Frank<br />\nSmith has footed the bill, and for<br />\nthis -unsurpassed record the other<br />\nbiologists deem him worthy of a<br />\nlittle notoriety. They are right,<br />\nMr. Smith; that, sir, is a deed<br />\nWorthy to place you before the<br />\npublic eye.<br />\n. And in conclusion, let me tell<br />\nyou, you didn't mind being paddled a bit for having your hands<br />\nin your pockets. To err is human<br />\nand to forgive divine, which goes<br />\nto prove that the sophomores are<br />\nnot divine.

Florence Lewis Speare addressed the<br />\nclub on \"Russian Dramatists and<br />\nthe Modern Russian Stage.\" Mrs.<br />\nSpeare, who has just been elected<br />\npresident of the Drama League of<br />\nBaltimore, was well qualified to<br />\nlecture. She is a graduate of<br />\nProf. George Pierce Baker's Workshop Theatre of Harvard and at<br />\npresent is director of dramatics<br />\nat Goucher College. Mrs. Speare<br />\nis a dramatic writer herself, and<br />\nthe vivid, colorful choice of words<br />\nand the interesting manner of<br />\npresentation made her lecture admirable and instructive.<br />\nMrs. Speare spoke of the Russian stage as the world's leading<br />\ntheatre where \"all the arts are<br />\ngathered together in a poem of<br />\nbeauty.\" Before the rise of the<br />\nRussian influence, the stage, both<br />\nin Europe and America, consisted<br />\nvery largely in the presentation<br />\nof elaborate realistic scenes, which<br />\nfed the senses and made no appeal<br />\nto the imagination or the intellect. Suddenly a change came;<br />\nsymbolism of the stage was born.<br />\nIt was an attempt to symbolize<br />\nthe soul of the drama in the setting. It is this symbolism in the<br />\n\"mise en scene\" which the Russian spirit demands\u2014a symbolism<br />\nwhich is Oriental in barbaric brilliancy, vivid in passionate emotion and rich in temperamental<br />\nanalysis.

He is \"intellectualizing scenery.\" This school of stage<br />\nartists give freest expression to the<br />\nimagination. There is grotesque<br />\nopulence and fairy delicacy. The<br />\ndrama has been revolutionized. It<br />\nis far more than words; it is<br />\nscenes of pictures and symphonies<br />\n\u2022of sounds.

After the<br />\nprocession has entered, the remaining seats will be free to the<br />\npublic. A portion of the balcony<br />\nwill also be reserved for ticket<br />\nholders until 10.15 o'clock. The<br />\nexercises will begin punctually at<br />\n10.30 o'clock and will close probably before 12.30.

Needless to say punctuality will be necessary in coming<br />\nto the Lyric.

The superior physical<br />\ncondition and greater stamina of<br />\nthe Orange and Black told in the<br />\nlong run, for in the first half Hopkins played them to a standstill.<br />\nHowever, when the second period<br />\nwas called, it was plainly evident<br />\nwhat the outcome, which had<br />\nhitherto been uncertain, would be,<br />\nas the local boys showed their exhaustion plainly. Princeton, on<br />\nthe other hand, sent in several<br />\nfresh men and the score piled up.<br />\nThe only thing that marred a<br />\nperfect exhibition of basket-ball<br />\nwas the long shooting on the part<br />\nof Weiner and, to some extent, of<br />\nCuneo. This fault is the one<br />\nwhich Coach Murphy has been<br />\ncombatting throughout the season<br />\nwithout being able to overcome.<br />\nThe first half was replete with<br />\nthrills. Hopkins jumped off at<br />\nthe whistle,. running up three<br />\npoints before Princeton awoke.<br />\nThree fouls on the part of Hopkins followed in quick succession,<br />\ntwo of which Netts put through<br />\nthe hoop. Immediately after,<br />\nNetts scored a difficult goal and<br />\nthe visitors were ahead. Pretty<br />\nteamwork of Flinn and Weiner resulted in a basket and Hopkins<br />\nonce more forged ahead, to hold<br />\nthis lead till near the end of the<br />\nhalf, when Princeton made a rally<br />\nand chalked up four baskets. The<br />\nhalf ended with the Tigers at the<br />\nfat half of a 13-9 score.<br />\nThe second half was a sad affair for Hopkins' supporters.<br />\nPrinceton played all around the<br />\nlocal boys, scoring almost at will.<br />\nNetts had the edge_on Cuneo in<br />\nthe foul shooting, netting six baskets out of nine tries, as opposed<br />\nto three out of seven on the part<br />\nof the Black and Blue guard.<br />\nOn the defensive play, time<br />\nOrange and Black far outshone<br />\nthe local basketeers. When a<br />\nHopkins player got his hands on<br />\nthe ball he was almost invariably<br />\nconfronted by the problem of<br />\nworking the leather through the<br />\nentire Princeton team, while many<br />\ntimes three of the visitors would<br />\ntear down the floor with but one<br />\nBlack and Blue warrior to hinder<br />\nthem.<br />\nIn the preliminary contest, the<br />\nHopkins freshmen had no trouble<br />\nin trouncing the Poly quint to the<br />\ntune of 14-4. Aaronson outshone<br />\nall his team-mates on the offense,<br /><br />\nThe Johns Hopkins baseball<br />\nteam will assume this spring the<br />\nhardest and largest schedule<br />\nwhich any Hopkins nine has ever<br />\nundertaken. Manager Field has<br />\narranged games with the country's foremost collegiate baseball<br />\nteams, such as Holy Cross, Fordham, I'rinceton, Cornell, Tufts,<br />\netc. Easter week will open the<br />\nseason with an even half dozen<br />\ndiamond battles, the first of which<br />\nwill be with Priceton. Three extensive trips will be made by the<br />\nteam, one to southern climes to<br />\ntackle the University of Virginia<br />\nin her lair, and two northern colleges. The first, of a week's duration, will be undertaken the last<br />\nweek in April, on which excursion<br />\nFordham, Crescents, Columbia<br />\nand Stevens will be met. At present, Manager Fields has only two<br />\ngames on the card for the second<br />\ntrip, which will take place at the<br />\nend of the collegiate year, those<br />\nwith Boston College and Lehigh,<br />\nbut he has negotiations under way<br />\nwith several other universities.<br />\nThat the management feels safe<br />\nin binding the nine to such a rigorous contract seems to be wellgrounded, although nothing certain can be said at this date.<br />\nHowever, everything points to a<br />\nvery successful season, as the entire last year's team, with the exception of Judefind, the star<br />\ntwirler, will be found in uniform<br />\nonce more. Juclefind's place will<br />\nbe well _filled, however, as \"Ted\"<br />\nWelliver and \"Bobby\" Owings, as<br />\nwell as several new candidates,<br />\nwill adorn the mound for the<br />\nBlack and Blue this season. Welliver, it will be remembered, carried off all the pitching honors in<br />\n1918, but last year he contracted<br />\nthe flu and was forced to leave<br />\ncollege. However, he is back this<br />\nseason with bells on. \"Bobby\"<br />\nOwings, too, played in hard luck<br />\nlast year. He hails from Friends<br />\nSchool, on which team he starred<br />\nfor several years, but he was a<br />\nvictim of the blacklist, and was<br />\nunable to don the uniform.<br />\nWallace, a medico, who twirled<br />\nseveral games and led the team<br />\nwith the stick last season, will be<br />\non hand, ready to prove that he,<br />\ntoo, is in a class with Owings and<br />\nWelliver.<br />\nHerbert Armstrong, all-American inter-collegiate third baseman for two years, who has<br />\ncoached City College for several<br />\nyears, will guide the Black and<br />\nBlue through this spring.

Some have given forth<br />\nthe merry guffaw, others have<br />\nshaken their heads sadly at the<br />\nlatest signs of the mental depravity of our wisest and most venerable seekers after knowledge.<br />\nBoth have missed the point of the<br />\nmatter.<br />\nThe real facts are these: By.<br />\n,adopting canes as their private<br />\nmark of fame, the Senior Class is<br />\nforging another link into our<br />\nchain of Hopkins tradition. The<br />\ncane itself has always carried a<br />\ncertain air of distinction. Their<br />\ninfrequency of use at the present<br />\ntime is due perhaps to the rush<br />\nand hurry of the period. Our<br />\nSeniors will have, by then, almost<br />\ncompleted a period of study and of<br />\nstudent activity, and will have<br />\nbecome the leaders of the campus<br />\nlife. The cane will be a most appropriate accompaniment to'their<br />\ndignity.<br />\nThe spirit of an institution of<br />\nlearning, or, as our army circles<br />\nput it, the morale, is directly proportioned to the student traditions.

Morita was a graduate of Tokio University and was<br />\ndoing his second year's work at<br />\nHopkins.<br />\nDr. Livingston, professor of<br />\nplant physiology, considered him<br />\na fine scholar, an indefatigable<br />\nworker and a thorough gentleman,<br />\nand says that he gave great promise of becoming a leader in botanical science. Morita's experimentation was in such shape that Dr.<br />\nLivingston and Mr. H. C. Diehl<br />\nplan to prepare a brief report of<br />\nthe results of his experiments for<br />\npublication in the near future.<br />\nIn the universities of South<br />\nAmerica, subjects are commonly<br />\nstudied only for a professional<br />\nend. The scholar studies natural<br />\nsciences only in the medical school<br />\nfor their bearing on medicine, and<br />\nthe social sciences only in the law<br />\nschool for their bearing on jurisprudence. Hence the universities<br />\ngenerally contain only professional schools without any college of<br />\nliberal arts.<br />\nThe United States is carrying<br />\non two collossal experiments in<br />\neducation. One is to conduct its<br />\nschools largely through the services of unmarried ladies who average three years' teaching before<br />\nthey get married. The second is<br />\nto give education without religion.<br />\nThe United States has yet to prove<br />\nthat it will succeed in either or<br />\nboth of these experiments.\u2014Prof.<br />\nSisson, University of Montana.<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER'S MAILBAG<br />\nA Column in Which the Coriespondents<br />\nAre Allowed Latitude, but Shoulder the Responsibility.<br /><br />\nAll letters intended for publication<br />\nmust be concise.<br />\nNo attention will be paid to anonymous letters, but names signed as an<br />\nevidence of good faith will not be printed<br />\nif request is made that they be omitted.<br />\nThe publication of a letter is not to be<br />\ntaken as an indorsement of its views by<br />\nNEws-I,ErrErt, which invites the<br />\nfreest discussion of matters of general<br />\ninterest.<br /><br />\nThinks Hopkins is Dying of Dry Pot.<br />\nTo the Editor of THE NEWS-LETTER:<br /><br />\nFebruary 14, 1920.<br />\nSir\u2014it was with extreme regret<br />\nthat 1 heard of the resignation of<br />\nDr. Slonimsky from the faculty<br />\nof the Department of Philosophy.<br />\nHelping to solve the greatest probkm before the country today\u2014<br />\nthat of labor\u2014could not but make<br />\na man more capable of bringing to<br />\nhis classes a most valuable point<br />\nof view.<br />\nUniversities have often been accused of being too secluded and<br />\nout of touch with the problems of<br />\nthe world.

In BO many periodicals<br />\nof this kind the editorials are so<br />\nperfunctory that they are of little<br />\n\u2022 value.

He has, therefore,<br />\napplied \u2022 to THE NEWS-LETTER for permis\u2022 sion to preach a sermon in this week's<br />\nissue, and he sincerely hopes and trusts<br />\nthat his efforts will not be in vain. Needless<br />\nto say his request was granted, and we submit for your approval a little talk by the<br />\nRev. George Quack, D. 1).1<br /><br />\nBrethren, if you may be termed<br />\nas such, I am going to take may<br />\ntext this morning from the first<br />\nchapter of St. John, twenty-third<br />\nverse, \"the voice of one crying in<br />\nthe wilderness.\" The voice in<br />\nthis case I take to .\u2022 be the poor<br />\nlittle innocent freshman who finds<br />\nhimself deposited in the midst of<br />\na large university, not knowing<br />\nwhich way to turn without encountering a soph's paddle. Just<br />\na bit of advice to ye freshmen from<br />\none who has been through the<br />\nmill and knows, you can't get any<br />\nmore out of college life than you<br />\nput into it. Why, just the other<br />\nday Dr. Gilpin told me that<br />\nGeorge Wagner's kid brother (I<br />\ncan't think of his maiden name<br />\nright now) was in the midst of<br />\nmaking a concoction of silver nitrate by dissolving a dime in<br />\nnitric acid. \"Doc,\" he says, \"I<br />\nhaven't got a dime, will two<br />\nnickels do?\"<br />\nAnd then, freshmen, don't fool<br />\naway your precious hours of study<br />\nby going to the theatre- all the<br />\ntime like Chauncey Wright does.<br />\nThey tell me that he was summoned to his adviser not so long<br />\nago to receive some paternal advice. \"Lemme see your report,.<br />\nMr. Wright,\" said Dr. Gilpin.<br />\n\"Ahem, failed in two subjects,<br />\ndidn't you? Damn pity you didn't<br />\nflunk in three, and then we<br />\nwouldn't have to bother with<br />\nyou.\" Moral, don't do as I do,<br />\ndo as I say should be did.<br />\nIf you really and truly want to<br />\nmake an honest-to-gosh success of<br />\nyour college career commit some<br />\ncrime worthy of publication in my<br />\nworld-beating column. That done,<br />\nyour fame is assured for generations to come; in other words, you<br />\nhave burst into immortal print.<br />\nLike a little crowd of fellows in<br />\nBiology II have passed a bill<br />\nwhich states that the chap who<br />\nreceives the lowest mark in a quiz<br />\nhas to stand treat for the bunch.<br />\nFor the last five times Mr. Frank<br />\nSmith has footed the bill, and for<br />\nthis -unsurpassed record the other<br />\nbiologists deem him worthy of a<br />\nlittle notoriety. They are right,<br />\nMr. Smith; that, sir, is a deed<br />\nWorthy to place you before the<br />\npublic eye.<br />\n. And in conclusion, let me tell<br />\nyou, you didn't mind being paddled a bit for having your hands<br />\nin your pockets. To err is human<br />\nand to forgive divine, which goes<br />\nto prove that the sophomores are<br />\nnot divine.
