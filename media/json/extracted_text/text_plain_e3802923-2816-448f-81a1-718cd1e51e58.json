As a<br />\nfirst example as to how inaccurate<br />\nthose 'first facts' can be, \"twelve<br />\nto fourteen chairs valued at $90 $100 each\" were initially reported<br />\nstolen. Since then eight of those<br />\nhave been discovered in various<br />\nodd places around, including one<br />\nespecially surprising chair that<br />\nmade its way into the tunnels<br />\nwhich catacomb the Hopkins<br />\nunderground. The resevoir whom I<br />\ntapped for this information, Alan<br />\nSapakie, could not be so genial<br />\nwhen I pressed him for further<br />\nfigures. Though he made no<br />\ncomment upon the loss of<br />\n\"hundreds\" of beer mugs, it seems<br />\nthat in one weekend the<br />\nRathskellar took a dredge in their<br />\ninventory of 130 bear mugs valued<br />\nat $.50 apiece. These losses<br />\nnotwithstanding, somebody took a<br />\nfinal inventory and the Rathskellar<br />\nis down 16 pitchers, two formica<br />\ntables worth about $200 each,<br />\nthree original lithographs worth a<br />\ntotal of $600, and every ashtray<br />\nand salt and pepper shaker in the<br />\nplace.<br />\n<br />\nIt is unfortunate that Homewood administrators deemed it<br />\nnecessary to postpone renovation of the old Gilman book<br />\nstacks, consequently forestalling an easing of the crowded<br />\nconditions in the Eisenhower library. While Dr. Benton's<br />\nassertion that there were more pressing capital improvements<br />\nto be made is probably quite valid, it is still a shame that<br />\nextra money from within or without could not be found to<br />\nhelp sustain a good library collection.<br />\nAs compared to other major University libraries, the<br />\nEisenhower library has a relatively small budget for annual<br />\npurchases. It is therefore essential that what the University<br />\ndoes have, be maintained to the highest degree possible.<br />\nPermitting parts of the library collection to fall into a<br />\ndisarray, or worse, allowing the books and journals to decay<br />\ncould cause long range problems that could be quite costly,<br />\nand damage that could be irreparable. To a University, the<br />\nweakening of its libraries is a tragic loss.<br />\nWe therefore urge Dr. Benton to consider and reconsider<br />\nthe impact of a crowded library and a soot-filled,<br />\nunacceptable storage area on the University and hope that he<br />\nwill act upon it immediately.<br />\n<br />\nprograms<br />\n\"I think that certain departments...have not offered as<br />\nmany or as varied undergraduate courses as they should.\" We<br />\nagree with this assessment of the course offering situation as<br />\nregards Hopkins undergraduates, offered by Student<br />\nOmbudsman John Colmers. We find it sad, though, that<br />\n\"undergraduate pressure\" was the only remedy that Colmers<br />\n- a person with extensive experience in student-administrative<br />\nrelations - could suggest.<br />\nIt seems incongruous that the Homewood Deans and<br />\ndepartment chairmen - in positions to effect such change would need a display of \"pressure\" to be convinced that<br />\naction is necessary. Shouldn't department heads be motivated<br />\nby a sense of duty to offer an adequate program in their<br />\ndiscipline to undergraduates? As Colmers put it, they<br />\n\"should\" offer more courses, if only out of pride and respect<br />\nfor their responsibility.<br />\nWhy would the Deans, who appointed an Ombudsman in<br />\norder to have the benefit of a \"student perspective,\" need<br />\n\"pressure\" as an incentive to better the lot of the<br />\nundergraduate?<br />\nIL<br />\n<br />\n1J<br />\n<br />\ns.orcxe.<br />\n<br />\nW<br />\n<br />\n31.1UV-111t-IlL<br />\n<br />\nUll<br />\n<br />\nllle<br />\n<br />\nt\\A-A.t. be.w,.<br />\n<br />\nLU<br />\n<br />\nprinciple -<br />\n<br />\nBy JONATHAN M.

The justice is for some and<br />\nnot for others; This is clear. But<br />\nwho stands to lose the most from<br />\nthis? We who have already lost too<br />\nmuch; the poor and the middle<br />\nclasses.<br />\n\u2022 Ironic<br />\nIt is ironic that men who<br />\nbecome outlaws for following their<br />\nconsciences, or even their instinct<br />\nfor self preservation (A tolerable<br />\nhuman trait I suppose) must suffer<br />\nthe humulation of begging for<br />\nacceptance at great cost to<br />\nthemselves, while a defiant and<br />\narrogant power hungry devel who<br />\nhas spit in the faces of the<br />\nAmerican people is shown extreme<br />\ngenerosity and compassion. This<br />\nsurely bespeaks some pathological<br />\nmisfunction of the American mind.<br />\nWhat offends me most of all is<br />\nthe \"off the wall\" nonsense about<br />\nconscience, compassion, and the<br />\nembarrassment involved in jailing<br />\nan ex-President. This is an<br />\noutgrowth of some idiotic notions<br />\nab out Presidents being divinely<br />\ninspired chosen individuals, whose<br />\nintegrity is beyond reproach, and<br />\nwho can be relied upon to conduct<br />\nthemselves in angelic fashion.<br />\nClearly Richard Nixon was perhaps<br />\nfarthest from this mold than all the<br />\nothers. I also don't need to remind<br />\n'anyone that everyone thought Czar<br />\nNicholass II was divinely inspired<br />\ntoo. Shall we pardon Adolph<br />\nHitler for his unspeakable crime<br />\nagainst humanity because he too<br />\nwas in a posiiton of political<br />\npower?<br />\nAmerica should not only<br />\nreawaken it's sensitivities to the<br />\n<br />\nPart Four:<br />\nThe good thing about having the<br />\nStudent Union running the<br />\nRathskellar has a lot to do with the<br />\n<br />\nThe Student Union.<br />\nreason its called the Student<br />\nUnion, but in the interest of<br />\nbrevity I'll say only that not<br />\neverybody is out to get us. In the<br />\npast year the price of a barrel of<br />\nNational Bohemian has gone from<br />\n$18.00 to $24.00, and in the same<br />\ntone of voice and with great<br />\nconfidence I can say that<br />\neverything has gone up.

Well, we all<br />\nknow that the disastrous cuisine<br />\nthat effuses from such contracts,<br />\nand little more need be said about<br />\nthem. When the Student Union<br />\nwas in the process of conceiving<br />\nthe Rathskellar as we know it<br />\ntoday, they wanted something of<br />\nquality in the making. Nothing has<br />\nreally changed since then, and it<br />\nshould be considered a wise move<br />\nnot to turn the Rathskellar heart,<br />\nbody, and soul over to Saga. The<br />\nmeat you see was prepared by<br />\nSaga, and served by Saga, which<br />\nwas perhaps an unavoidable<br />\nmistake in this case, but the<br />\nUniversity paid for it, and if it gets<br />\nstolen the University is going to<br />\nabsorb the loss. I haven't hitherto<br />\ndiscovered exactly how much Saga<br />\ngets paid for their services, but it<br />\nreally makes no difference at all<br />\nbecause the villain is in hiding and<br />\ncan't be hurt. If the Rathskellar<br />\never manages to survive the<br />\ntremendous cost of opening and<br />\nsee its way into the black ink its<br />\nthe Student Union which recycles<br />\nthe bulk of the profits. When they<br />\nprofit, you profit. See?<br />\n<br />\n'Why am I talking to myself?'<br />\n<br />\nletters to the editor<br />\n<br />\nTo the Editor:<br />\nI am surprised to see the<br />\nmembers of the Hopkins<br />\ncommunity reacting with such<br />\nremarkable aplomb to the recent<br />\npardon of Richard Nixon by<br />\nGerald Ford. It would seem to me<br />\nthat people connected with an<br />\ninstitution so well know for it's<br />\nactive and intelligent student body,<br />\nas future leaders in a society where<br />\nintellect is more highly regarded<br />\nthan character, would obviously<br />\nsee that a great miscarriage of<br />\njustice has taken place and feet it<br />\ntheir responsibility to issue a<br />\nstronger protest. The<br />\nconstitutional rights of the entire<br />\nAmerican people have been<br />\ncompromised and one finds little<br />\nmore than a sigh in response to it.<br />\nAs a Black, I am extremely<br />\naware that if I walked into J.C.<br />\nPenny's and \"lifted\" a pair of<br />\ndesperately needed socks or even<br />\nbread, I would be expecred to bear<br />\nthe full consequences of my<br />\naction. This of course when the<br />\n.right of free enterprise, a right only<br />\nthe rich and politically prominent<br />\nhave the power to exercise, is<br />\ncompromised in the most petty<br />\nway. This I believe firmly, despite<br />\nassurances from conservative<br />\nelements that the American system<br />\nof justice has deteriorated into a<br />\nrevolving door.<br />\nOn the contrary, if I am to<br />\naccept this assertion, then I am<br />\nconvinced that this monumental<br />\nerror is a prime example. I am<br />\nforced then to shrug lily shoulders<br />\nand answer in reply: -WELL what<br />\ndid you expect?\". On the other<br />\nhand, if I were caught in a criminal<br />\nsituation, not only would I not<br />\nescape INDICTMENT AND Trial,<br />\nas well as the loss of job and<br />\npersonal and financial injury to my<br />\nfamily, but I could not count on<br />\nbeing tucked away in the<br />\nsumptuous California sun in a<br />\nmagniticnet Spanish hideaway with<br />\na S90.000 government pension. I<br />\n<br />\nPart Two:<br />\nSO much for daylight thefts. No<br />\none can argue with Fitzpatrick on<br />\nthe probability of the point that<br />\nthese are all student thefts. Notice<br />\nhere that thefts is plural. Probably<br />\nhalf of the persons who drink beer<br />\nin the Rathskellar have a memento<br />\nmug or two on their shelves. \"Such<br />\nthievery is only logical\" \"I have<br />\nheard many say, \"when someone<br />\nrips you off, you want to rip them<br />\noff right back.\" In this case the<br />\nripperofferer is known to be none<br />\nother than the infidel Saga, whose<br />\nvegetables have greened many a<br />\nface and whose cottage cheese has<br />\nsoured many a stomach.

I am as much to blame as<br />\nanyone for I chose not to live in<br />\nthe house. You need more than 13<br />\nboarding brothers to keep the<br />\nhouse perking.<br />\nAnyone who participated in last<br />\nFebruary's Beta rush realized what<br />\n<br />\ndecadence lurked inside that<br />\nmysterious house on Canterbury<br />\nRoad. Seemingly, no one cared. It<br />\nwas just one bong after the other<br />\nand when that was through, the<br />\nbeer was flowing freeely, including<br />\non the walls, floor and stoned<br />\nBetas. But is was for this reason,<br />\nthe fact that Betas were relaxed<br />\nand not taking the rigors of this<br />\nuniversity with endless supplies of<br />\nDigel for upset studying<br />\nstomaches, that I and almoSt 20<br />\nothers decided to go Beta and no<br />\nother.<br />\nObviously, the older brothers<br />\nwere more than successful in<br />\nconveying that message to us in the<br />\nclass of '77. I think they were too<br />\nsuccessful.<br />\nTypical<br />\nSince our pledge class seemed to<br />\nhave an ample supply of typical<br />\nBeta material, we had to rely on<br />\nthe help of the senior Beta veterans<br />\nto help get us on our way.<br />\nUnfortunately, none was<br />\nforthcoming. Of our elected<br />\nofficers, the President is nowhere<br />\nto be found and hasn't bothered to<br />\nsay anything. A summer letter<br />\nfrom Beta's faculty advisor<br />\ninformed me of his fate. Our<br />\nPresident had decided to quit<br />\nschool. Our vice-president decided<br />\nlast year he wouldn't be living in<br />\nthe house. Our treasurer, perhaps<br />\n<br />\nthe one who drove the final nail<br />\ninto the coffin by moving out with<br />\ntwo pledges before most had<br />\narrived back on campus, told me to<br />\n\"let Beta die\" when I discussed<br />\nwith him my plans for writing this<br />\nstory. I felt an obligation to say<br />\nother things for the record.<br />\nAll the incoming Beta pledges<br />\nwere more than willing to do the<br />\nwork necessary to clean up that<br />\n\"lovely old house.\" They never<br />\nhad a chance to. Even if only a<br />\ndozen or so decided to live there,<br />\nBeta could have slid by another<br />\nyear hoping that the long awaited<br />\nalumni money would come<br />\nthrough. And who's to say how<br />\nmany other Betas would have<br />\nmoved in during the year? The<br />\nquestions seem to be moot since<br />\nthe fraternity has taken the course<br />\nwhich may lead to a not so<br />\nglorious end.<br />\nBut there may still.be a sliver of<br />\nhope. Not all the depledged<br />\npledges have lost interest, at least<br />\nnot yet. And I'm sure there are<br />\nsome bitter Betas out there quite<br />\nticked off because of what's<br />\nhappened to Beta.<br />\nlo<br />\nI think that anyone who ever<br />\nwalked through the front door of<br />\nthat house to attend a Beta<br />\nblowout could ever forget what<br />\n, Beta hospitality was like. And who<br />\n1<br />\n<br />\ncould deny that Beta Theta Pi had<br />\nthe all-time most rowdy parties? If<br />\nHopkins loses Beta, it won't be<br />\nsuch a tremendous loose to<br />\nnon-Betas, (there are still other<br />\nfraternities which will each absorb<br />\nthe clientele which once<br />\npatronized Beta affairs), but it will<br />\nbe a blow to Harry Gotwals, our<br />\nFaculty advisor who was willing to<br />\nstump for us since his rise to that<br />\nposition, old Betas who<br />\nremembered the way it was only a<br />\nshort year ago and the new Betas<br />\nwho wanted to be part of a real<br />\nnon-lunch fraternity.<br />\nPoor Condition<br />\nI don't think its all over yet.<br />\nThere is probably no way to<br />\nreopen the house considering the<br />\npoor condition of the place but<br />\nmaybe the still interested Beta<br />\nde-pledges can get together and do<br />\nsomething.<br />\nLet's not let our Beta character<br />\nof not giving a damn allow us to let<br />\nBeta slip away. Where else can you<br />\nburn the living room furniture in<br />\nthe fireplace for the hell ofit, turn<br />\nyour kitchen into a ruin fit only<br />\nfor the bugs that appreciated Beta<br />\ncooking? etc., etc, continuing a<br />\nlong list of fine .memories of a<br />\nsometimes boring stay at Hopkins.<br />\nThe Beta house can still work if<br />\nthere are people willing enough tr\u2022<br />\ntry it again.<br />\n<br />\n1HE NEWS-1ETTER<br />\nMarc Duvoisin, Alan Hirsch<br />\n<br />\neditors-in-chief<br />\nbusiness manager<br />\nday editors<br />\nmanaging editor<br />\nfeatures editor<br />\nphotography editors<br />\nsports editors<br />\nproduction manager<br />\n<br />\nLinda Joy<br />\nJay Goodgold, Lainy Stephans<br />\nClayton Buick<br />\nJohn Srygley<br />\nBrian Blitz, JeffPosner<br />\nStephen Levin, Robert Rosen wasser<br />\nDante Landucci<br />\n<br />\nstaff writers: John Blootnenthal, Bob Buchanan, Joe Buscema,<br />\nLouisa Davis, Bob Danner, Patrice Gallagher, Leonard Levie, Rich<br />\nLorraine, Michael Manes, Ava Saffron, Paula Tarnopol, John<br />\nTetzlaff, Liz Wallace.<br />\nproduction: Terry Carraway, Greg Diamond, Craig Nankin.<br />\nphotographers: Gary Barg, Mike Bloch, Joachitn Blunck, Arno<br />\nCohen, Leah Seidenfeld, Joanne Silberner. .<br />\ntypists: Pam Davis, Mark Hylind, Sandy Silbertnan.<br />\n<br />\nHEAWVA6VAS<br />\nA GOOD WALLFUIIVEK<br />\n<br />\nI/<br />\n<br />\nThe News-Letter is published twice each week, Tuesdays and Fridays, during<br />\nthe school year by the students of the Johns Hopkins University, Homewood<br />\nCampus, Baltimore, Maryland.

It looks like another<br />\ngood year for Coach Dennis<br />\nCox's charges, who are<br />\ncontinuing in the fine Hopkins<br />\nfootball tradition which has seen<br />\nthe past three teams compile 6-3<br />\nrecords.<br />\nThe offensive unit was hit<br />\nhardest by graduation with 6<br />\nstarters 'departing, including the<br />\nentire starting backfield. The key<br />\nloss will, of course, be<br />\nquarterback Jack Thomas. As<br />\nwell as being a fine versatile<br />\nathlete (he handled the kicking<br />\n'chores in addition to the QB's<br />\njob) Thomas was also a great<br />\nleader and that is going to be a<br />\nhard quality to replace. Coach<br />\nCox, hOwever, appears to have<br />\nfound some very capable<br />\nreplacements for the graduated<br />\nstaters.<br />\nThree quarterback prospects<br />\nare in the running to lead the<br />\nBlue Jays multiple formation<br />\noffense. Bill Norbeck the only<br />\nmember of the trio returning<br />\nfrom last year's team, looks to<br />\nhave the inside track on the<br />\nstarting jOb. At 6'3\", 180<br />\nNorbeck runs and throws well<br />\nand gained valuable game<br />\nexperience, last season. Pressing<br />\nNorbeck for the starting spot are<br />\nDave Emala, a freshman and<br />\nGeorge Keckeison, a junior.<br />\nKeckeison played as a freshman<br />\nand this will be starting his<br />\nsecond season in a Blue Jay<br />\nuniform.<br />\nEmala, from Gilman' School<br />\nhere in Baltimore, is a fine punter<br />\nas well as an outstanding<br />\nquarterback prospect. He'll<br />\nprobably handle the punting<br />\nchores for the Homewood eleven<br />\nthis year as well as backing<br />\nNorbeck.<br />\nCoach Cox has instituted an<br />\noffensive change this season.<br />\nInstead of operating from a<br />\nfour-back backfield (quarterback<br />\nand three running backs) with<br />\nonly one wide receiver, the Jays<br />\nwill be using a 3-back backfield<br />\nand two wide receivers.<br />\nReturning sophomore Sam Matz,<br />\n5'11\", 195, will draw the starting<br />\nassignment at fullback. \"Sam's<br />\nimproved 100 percent over last<br />\nyear,\" said Cox, \"He's looked<br />\nexcellent.\" Backing up Matz will<br />\nbe the two starting inside<br />\nlinebackers (all Blue Jay players<br />\nlearn two positions), Bob<br />\nMaimone and Franz<br />\nWit telsberger. Freshman John<br />\nCoad has been switched from<br />\noffensive tackle to fullback to<br />\ninsure the Jays good depth at<br />\nthat position.<br />\nThere are two fine prospects<br />\nrunning out of the tailback spot<br />\nand Coach Cox plans to make use<br />\nof both of them. Sophomore<br />\nMike Rhodey returns from last<br />\nyear's squad where he played left<br />\nhalfback. Shifted to tailback in<br />\nthis year's offense, Cox said of<br />\nthe 6'1\", 190 pound Rhodey,<br />\n\"He's improved a lot over last<br />\nyear.\" Sharing the spot with<br />\nRhodey will be outstanding<br />\n<br />\nfreshman Steve DeVeas. DeVeas,<br />\n5'11\", 190, was a 1st\"am<br />\nMaryland High School All-Star<br />\nselection and has looked very<br />\ngood so far. Supplying additional<br />\ndepth at tailback is Fran<br />\nWeigmann who Cox called \"the<br />\nbest dive back on the team.\"<br />\nAt wide receiver, the<br />\ngraduation of \"Super Gnat\" Billy<br />\nNolan, the leading receiver in the<br />\nentire state of Maryland (Thomas<br />\nwas the leading passer), is no<br />\nsmall hole to fill. Tom Cirillo<br />\nlooks to be the starting flanker in<br />\nthe new 2 wide receiver offense.<br />\nThis represents a shift for Cirillo<br />\nwho was a running back last year<br />\nbut has shown good hands and<br />\ngood speed this year in making<br />\nthe move to flanker.<br />\nBasketballer Greg Delong<br />\nreturns to action on the gridiron<br />\nfor the first time since high<br />\nschool and looks to use his 6'4\",<br />\n195 pound frame to good<br />\nadvantage. Backing him up are<br />\nJoey Devlin, 5'7\", 170 and Bruce<br />\nBaillie, 6.1\", 190.<br />\nThe offensive line appears to<br />\nbe the real proven strength of<br />\nthis year's attacking unit. \"We<br />\nhave excellent linemen ,\" Cox.<br />\nsaid, \"and we really expect them<br />\nto do a job.\" Five out of six<br />\nstarters return, with center the<br />\nonly open spot. Scott Smith is<br />\nthe returning tight end. He took<br />\nover for the injured Mike Bogdan<br />\nin the fourth game of the year<br />\nlast season and finished the year<br />\nup in fine style. The 6'1\", 205<br />\npounder is an excellent receiver<br />\nand a fine blocker. John Nutting, 6'0\", 195 and<br />\nWayne Panullo, 5'9\", 205, are<br />\nthe returning starters at guard.<br />\nNutting, a junior, is a three year<br />\nstarter and Panullo, also a junior,.<br />\nis in his second season as first<br />\nstringer.<br />\nJim Duffy, 6'2\", 220 and John<br />\nBojarski, 6'0\", 205, . man the<br />\ntackle slots. Both juniors, Duffy<br />\nhas been starting for 3 seasons<br />\nand Bojarski for two, giving the<br />\nBlue Jayg a veteran offensive line.<br />\nMarshall DeSantis., a returning<br />\njunior, looks to replace Jim<br />\nMoran at center. Excellent depth<br />\nin the offensive line is provided<br />\nby Mark Salvaggio at guard and<br />\nDick Witsil, Mark Hetherington<br />\nand Curtis Johnson at tackle.<br />\nOn defense Hopkins uses a<br />\nsplit-6 formation with the<br />\ndefensive tackles spread, leaving<br />\nthe middle to the 2 inside<br />\nlinebackers. Defensively the Jays<br />\nlook tough this season with eight<br />\nstarters returning from last year's<br />\neleven. Co-captain Bruce Parker<br />\nwill be manning the left defensive<br />\nend post with Fran Weigmann on<br />\nthe right flank. Senior Curtis<br />\nJohnson, 6'4\", 195 will be<br />\nstarting at left defensive tackle<br />\nwith Willie Oliver on the right<br />\nside.

That was<br />\n45% of Hopkin's total output,<br />\nand a team that generates just<br />\nsomewhat over one point a game,<br />\non the average, cannot, on the<br />\naverage, afford to lose 45% of its<br />\noffense.

The interview was<br />\nconducted Wednesday, September 11,<br />\nand concerns those issues with which<br />\nColmers will deal this year as<br />\nOmbudsman\u2014pass-fail policy, course<br />\nofferings, and student interaction with<br />\nthe Deans.<br />\nNews-Letter: In what areas do you<br />\nplan to concentrate this academic year as<br />\nOmbudsman?<br />\nColmers: Two areas. The first is dealing<br />\ndirectly with students and their academic<br />\nproblems, the second is in broader areas<br />\nconcerning work with the curriculum and<br />\nchanges in the'academic prop-am.<br />\nN-L: How much influence do you<br />\nreally have as regards the Deans and their<br />\ndecisions?<br />\n\u2022 Colmers: I'm really nothing more than<br />\njust somebody with easy access to the<br />\n.Deans. Any weight that the office carries<br />\n.comes from how effectively I can express<br />\nthe needs of the students to the Deans.<br />\nN-L: But will they listen to you? Will<br />\nthey attribute any importance to what<br />\nyou say?<br />\nColmers: I think if a matter is not<br />\ntrivial and I present it sincerely, they'll<br />\nlisten. But then again, what they do is a<br />\ndifferent story. I know that the Deans<br />\nwon't be in favor of everything that I'm<br />\nin favor of. But I'm sure that I'll be<br />\nlistened to on just about any topic.<br />\nN-L: Do you have any regrets that<br />\nstudents were not allowed any<br />\nparticipation in the selection of .the<br />\nOmbudsman?<br />\nColmers: I certainly think that in the<br />\nfuture\u2014nothing can be done now\u2014I'd<br />\nwelcome as much participation on the<br />\npart of the students as the Deans will<br />\npermit.<br />\nN-L: In making decisions, -whose<br />\nperspective will you adopt\u2014that of the<br />\nDeans, whose office pays your salary, or<br />\nthat ofthe students?<br />\nColmers: No question. Being a student,<br />\nI'll have a student interests foremost in<br />\nmind. That's what I bring to the office. I<br />\ntry to bring the point of view of someone<br />\n<br />\nJohn Colmers<br />\nwho is a student at\u2022Hopkins and has had<br />\nproblems with the system.<br />\nN-L: Referring back to your plans for<br />\nthis year, what specific changes are you<br />\ngoing to work for?<br />\n\u2022<br />\nColmers: I have no specific plans yet,<br />\nbut if I see something that's obviously a<br />\nhindrance to students and has a broad<br />\nbase of students against it, then I'll get to<br />\nwork on it. I'm not going to sit back, if<br />\nstudents are clamoring for change, and<br />\nsay \"that's the way it is.\" As far as<br />\nacademics go, the CUS [the Committee<br />\non Undergraduate Studies] is the major<br />\narea for undergraduate input. I foresee.<br />\nmyself workibg, with the undergraduates<br />\non the CUS in whatever capacity I can.<br />\nN-L: Since the limits and powers of the<br />\nOmbudsman position have never' been<br />\nofficially decided upon, much less 'set<br />\ndown, are you going to expand upon the<br />\npowers Shep Hoffman exercised as<br />\nOmbudsman last year?<br />\nColmers: I think I'd like to .see the<br />\n<br />\noffice be one that can work with the CUS<br />\nand the Student Council to bring about<br />\nacademic change. I think I can bring to<br />\nthe position my experience with the<br />\nStudent Council and hopefully bring new<br />\nideas to the front.<br />\nN-L: What is your opinion on the<br />\npass-fail policy for first semester<br />\nfreshman? Did you favor tile old<br />\n\"airtight\" policy or the new, more<br />\nflexible one?<br />\nColmers: I think the old system was<br />\ntoo rigid. But the attempt to change it<br />\nlast year was done in a bush league way.<br />\nThe University had an obligation to the<br />\nstudents who started on the original<br />\nsystem. I think the new system for this<br />\nyear's Freshmen could alleviate some of<br />\nthe problems of the old one. There are<br />\ndifficulties with pass- fail policy because<br />\nthere simply isn't enough documentation<br />\nto go on. A lot of supposition on<br />\neveryone's part comes into play.<br />\nThere was a problem with the old<br />\n\"airtight\" system. If this new system can<br />\nbe flexible enough to allow for the<br />\nsuccessful review of individual cases,<br />\nthere will have been a big improvement.<br />\nToo many people were treated unfairly<br />\nby the old, unyielding system\u2014students<br />\ngraduating early, scholarship. applicants,<br />\nand so on.<br />\nN-L: But didn't the changes in the<br />\npass-fail policy do damage to its original<br />\npurpose, which was to give the freshmen<br />\ntime to adjust by assuring them that their<br />\nfirst semester grades Would never be<br />\nreleased? The new system's flexibility<br />\nremoves that security, doesn't it?<br />\nColmers: First, you have to go back<br />\nand see why the old policy was \"airtight\"<br />\nin the first place. It wasn't done so that<br />\npeople could screw around for their<br />\nentire first semester here. It was done so<br />\nthat people could get used to being away<br />\nfrom home, the rigors of college life, etc.<br />\nBeing ,realistic, the medical schools are<br />\ninterested in only two grades\u2014chemistry<br />\nand calculus, so the freshmen have leeway<br />\nwith the Other grades. Plus those are<br />\ncourses which continue into the second<br />\nsemester so you have to do well first<br />\nsemester in order to be able to continue<br />\nsuccessfully. I think the new system, if<br />\npeople look at it in the right light, still<br />\noffers people,the chance to get used to<br />\nHo kins.<br />\n<br />\nN-L: How doyou feel about the<br />\nreinstitution of the Dean's List?<br />\nColmers: I don't think it's any good.<br />\nAcademics should be their own reward. It<br />\nwill tend to increase competitiveness<br />\nhere. I just think that if you do well, your<br />\nreward should be the knowledge that you<br />\nattained. There already are . ancillary<br />\nawards. For example, if you do well, your<br />\nchances for acceptance at graduate school<br />\nare enhance.<br />\nN-L: Do you agree with nwst<br />\nundergraduates that course offerings here<br />\nare insufficient? If you do, what do you<br />\nplan to do about it from your position?<br />\nColmers: I do think that certain<br />\ndepartments\u2014which will go unnamed<br />\nhere\u2014have not offered as many or .as<br />\nvaried undergraduate courses as they<br />\nshould, both introductory and 300-level<br />\ncourses. What to do about it is a<br />\ncompletely different story. I think<br />\nundergraduate pressure really is a key<br />\npoint here. If enough undergraduates go<br />\nto a department chairman and ask \"Why<br />\nisn't there such and such a course? It's<br />\nvital to this discipline,\" something will be<br />\ndone. They won't remain deaf to<br />\ncomplaints. Courses come from the<br />\nprofessors themselves. Before Dick Cone<br />\nof Biophysics offered Physiology last<br />\nyear, there had never been an<br />\nintroductory undergraduate course in<br />\nthat subject in my years here. He found<br />\nhithself with Remsen I filled with<br />\nstudents. The same With Botany. It's a<br />\nmajor part of Biology, but until this year<br />\nit was never offered to undergraduates at<br />\nan introductory level while I've been<br />\nhere. These courses came out as a<br />\nresponse to the undergraduates.<br />\nN-L: Then there is hope, you think?<br />\nColmers: There's hope, but unless<br />\nstudents make their wishes know, and<br />\nthis can be done through my position, the<br />\nCUS or the Student Council, I don't<br />\nthink there's going to be a major increase<br />\nin the number or type of courses offered.<br />\nN-L: Are students -correct in their<br />\nbelief that Deans Owen and Suskind are<br />\nsomewhat disaffected, oblivious to the<br />\ndesires of undergraduates?<br />\nConners: I realize that students get<br />\nthat impression, but I don't think it's<br />\ntrue. I think both of them make an<br />\nhonest and sincere effort to keep in touch<br />\nwith what students want.<br />\n<br />\nWhere To Buy.

As a<br />\nfirst example as to how inaccurate<br />\nthose 'first facts' can be, \"twelve<br />\nto fourteen chairs valued at $90 $100 each\" were initially reported<br />\nstolen. Since then eight of those<br />\nhave been discovered in various<br />\nodd places around, including one<br />\nespecially surprising chair that<br />\nmade its way into the tunnels<br />\nwhich catacomb the Hopkins<br />\nunderground. The resevoir whom I<br />\ntapped for this information, Alan<br />\nSapakie, could not be so genial<br />\nwhen I pressed him for further<br />\nfigures. Though he made no<br />\ncomment upon the loss of<br />\n\"hundreds\" of beer mugs, it seems<br />\nthat in one weekend the<br />\nRathskellar took a dredge in their<br />\ninventory of 130 bear mugs valued<br />\nat $.50 apiece. These losses<br />\nnotwithstanding, somebody took a<br />\nfinal inventory and the Rathskellar<br />\nis down 16 pitchers, two formica<br />\ntables worth about $200 each,<br />\nthree original lithographs worth a<br />\ntotal of $600, and every ashtray<br />\nand salt and pepper shaker in the<br />\nplace.<br /><br />\nIt is unfortunate that Homewood administrators deemed it<br />\nnecessary to postpone renovation of the old Gilman book<br />\nstacks, consequently forestalling an easing of the crowded<br />\nconditions in the Eisenhower library. While Dr. Benton's<br />\nassertion that there were more pressing capital improvements<br />\nto be made is probably quite valid, it is still a shame that<br />\nextra money from within or without could not be found to<br />\nhelp sustain a good library collection.<br />\nAs compared to other major University libraries, the<br />\nEisenhower library has a relatively small budget for annual<br />\npurchases. It is therefore essential that what the University<br />\ndoes have, be maintained to the highest degree possible.<br />\nPermitting parts of the library collection to fall into a<br />\ndisarray, or worse, allowing the books and journals to decay<br />\ncould cause long range problems that could be quite costly,<br />\nand damage that could be irreparable. To a University, the<br />\nweakening of its libraries is a tragic loss.<br />\nWe therefore urge Dr. Benton to consider and reconsider<br />\nthe impact of a crowded library and a soot-filled,<br />\nunacceptable storage area on the University and hope that he<br />\nwill act upon it immediately.<br /><br />\nprograms<br />\n\"I think that certain departments...have not offered as<br />\nmany or as varied undergraduate courses as they should.\" We<br />\nagree with this assessment of the course offering situation as<br />\nregards Hopkins undergraduates, offered by Student<br />\nOmbudsman John Colmers. We find it sad, though, that<br />\n\"undergraduate pressure\" was the only remedy that Colmers<br />\n- a person with extensive experience in student-administrative<br />\nrelations - could suggest.<br />\nIt seems incongruous that the Homewood Deans and<br />\ndepartment chairmen - in positions to effect such change would need a display of \"pressure\" to be convinced that<br />\naction is necessary. Shouldn't department heads be motivated<br />\nby a sense of duty to offer an adequate program in their<br />\ndiscipline to undergraduates? As Colmers put it, they<br />\n\"should\" offer more courses, if only out of pride and respect<br />\nfor their responsibility.<br />\nWhy would the Deans, who appointed an Ombudsman in<br />\norder to have the benefit of a \"student perspective,\" need<br />\n\"pressure\" as an incentive to better the lot of the<br />\nundergraduate?<br />\nIL<br /><br />\n1J<br /><br />\ns.orcxe.<br /><br />\nW<br /><br />\n31.1UV-111t-IlL<br /><br />\nUll<br /><br />\nllle<br /><br />\nt\\A-A.t. be.w,.<br /><br />\nLU<br /><br />\nprinciple -<br /><br />\nBy JONATHAN M.

The<br />\nmeat you see was prepared by<br />\nSaga, and served by Saga, which<br />\nwas perhaps an unavoidable<br />\nmistake in this case, but the<br />\nUniversity paid for it, and if it gets<br />\nstolen the University is going to<br />\nabsorb the loss. I haven't hitherto<br />\ndiscovered exactly how much Saga<br />\ngets paid for their services, but it<br />\nreally makes no difference at all<br />\nbecause the villain is in hiding and<br />\ncan't be hurt. If the Rathskellar<br />\never manages to survive the<br />\ntremendous cost of opening and<br />\nsee its way into the black ink its<br />\nthe Student Union which recycles<br />\nthe bulk of the profits. When they<br />\nprofit, you profit. See?<br /><br />\n'Why am I talking to myself?'<br /><br />\nletters to the editor<br /><br />\nTo the Editor:<br />\nI am surprised to see the<br />\nmembers of the Hopkins<br />\ncommunity reacting with such<br />\nremarkable aplomb to the recent<br />\npardon of Richard Nixon by<br />\nGerald Ford. It would seem to me<br />\nthat people connected with an<br />\ninstitution so well know for it's<br />\nactive and intelligent student body,<br />\nas future leaders in a society where<br />\nintellect is more highly regarded<br />\nthan character, would obviously<br />\nsee that a great miscarriage of<br />\njustice has taken place and feet it<br />\ntheir responsibility to issue a<br />\nstronger protest. The<br />\nconstitutional rights of the entire<br />\nAmerican people have been<br />\ncompromised and one finds little<br />\nmore than a sigh in response to it.<br />\nAs a Black, I am extremely<br />\naware that if I walked into J.C.<br />\nPenny's and \"lifted\" a pair of<br />\ndesperately needed socks or even<br />\nbread, I would be expecred to bear<br />\nthe full consequences of my<br />\naction. This of course when the<br />\n.right of free enterprise, a right only<br />\nthe rich and politically prominent<br />\nhave the power to exercise, is<br />\ncompromised in the most petty<br />\nway. This I believe firmly, despite<br />\nassurances from conservative<br />\nelements that the American system<br />\nof justice has deteriorated into a<br />\nrevolving door.<br />\nOn the contrary, if I am to<br />\naccept this assertion, then I am<br />\nconvinced that this monumental<br />\nerror is a prime example. I am<br />\nforced then to shrug lily shoulders<br />\nand answer in reply: -WELL what<br />\ndid you expect?\". On the other<br />\nhand, if I were caught in a criminal<br />\nsituation, not only would I not<br />\nescape INDICTMENT AND Trial,<br />\nas well as the loss of job and<br />\npersonal and financial injury to my<br />\nfamily, but I could not count on<br />\nbeing tucked away in the<br />\nsumptuous California sun in a<br />\nmagniticnet Spanish hideaway with<br />\na S90.000 government pension. I<br /><br />\nPart Two:<br />\nSO much for daylight thefts. No<br />\none can argue with Fitzpatrick on<br />\nthe probability of the point that<br />\nthese are all student thefts. Notice<br />\nhere that thefts is plural. Probably<br />\nhalf of the persons who drink beer<br />\nin the Rathskellar have a memento<br />\nmug or two on their shelves. \"Such<br />\nthievery is only logical\" \"I have<br />\nheard many say, \"when someone<br />\nrips you off, you want to rip them<br />\noff right back.\" In this case the<br />\nripperofferer is known to be none<br />\nother than the infidel Saga, whose<br />\nvegetables have greened many a<br />\nface and whose cottage cheese has<br />\nsoured many a stomach. Saga runs<br />\nthe lunch table in the Rathskellar,<br />\nselling roast beef and ham<br />\nsandwiches for what many<br />\nconsider to be exorbitant prices ..<br />\n. hence we steal steal steal from the<br />\nheartless villain whom we have<br />\nhated for so long . . . . Assuming<br />\nthat all this was true, things<br />\nwouldn't be as bad as they are, as<br />\nSaga would certianly raise prices or<br />\nlower quality to cover the costs of<br />\nreplacing all of these vanishing<br />\narticles.<br /><br />\npragmatic, the realistic and the<br />\nprogressive, but stop looking<br />\nyhrough rose colored glasses at<br />\nitself, it's people and it's leaders.<br />\nThe constitution protected the<br />\ndemocracy this time, now let it<br />\nprotect it's charges in the fashion<br />\nwhich the forefathers proposed.

Even<br />\nthough they can feel the money<br />\ncrunch as much as any other<br />\nbusiness enterprise, they can not<br />\nsimply fold under because there<br />\naren't enough dollars. Despite the<br />\nfact that you may have read two<br />\nprevious articles in this newspaper<br />\nclaiming that this fate had befallen<br />\nthe oldest frat at Hopkins, this<br />\nsimply is not the entire case. This<br />\nmay help clear the picture.<br />\nBeta isn't dead yet but it is on<br />\nthe verge of dying for still another<br />\nreason. Nobody gives a shit. Since<br />\nreturning to this campus, I, as well<br />\nas a few others who would have<br />\ncomprised the incoming pledge<br />\nclass, have found that a few Betas<br />\nhad begun making unilateral<br />\ndecisions that had led Beta to<br />\nbecome a furnitureless, lifeless<br />\nhouse.<br />\nBut Tom, you certainly were<br />\nright about some things. It takes a<br />\nlot of organization and<br />\nbrotherhood to make Beta what it<br />\nwould have been for yet another<br />\nyear. Too bad if just wasn't there<br />\nthis year. I am as much to blame as<br />\nanyone for I chose not to live in<br />\nthe house. You need more than 13<br />\nboarding brothers to keep the<br />\nhouse perking.<br />\nAnyone who participated in last<br />\nFebruary's Beta rush realized what<br /><br />\ndecadence lurked inside that<br />\nmysterious house on Canterbury<br />\nRoad. Seemingly, no one cared. It<br />\nwas just one bong after the other<br />\nand when that was through, the<br />\nbeer was flowing freeely, including<br />\non the walls, floor and stoned<br />\nBetas. But is was for this reason,<br />\nthe fact that Betas were relaxed<br />\nand not taking the rigors of this<br />\nuniversity with endless supplies of<br />\nDigel for upset studying<br />\nstomaches, that I and almoSt 20<br />\nothers decided to go Beta and no<br />\nother.<br />\nObviously, the older brothers<br />\nwere more than successful in<br />\nconveying that message to us in the<br />\nclass of '77. I think they were too<br />\nsuccessful.<br />\nTypical<br />\nSince our pledge class seemed to<br />\nhave an ample supply of typical<br />\nBeta material, we had to rely on<br />\nthe help of the senior Beta veterans<br />\nto help get us on our way.<br />\nUnfortunately, none was<br />\nforthcoming. Of our elected<br />\nofficers, the President is nowhere<br />\nto be found and hasn't bothered to<br />\nsay anything. A summer letter<br />\nfrom Beta's faculty advisor<br />\ninformed me of his fate. Our<br />\nPresident had decided to quit<br />\nschool. Our vice-president decided<br />\nlast year he wouldn't be living in<br />\nthe house. Our treasurer, perhaps<br /><br />\nthe one who drove the final nail<br />\ninto the coffin by moving out with<br />\ntwo pledges before most had<br />\narrived back on campus, told me to<br />\n\"let Beta die\" when I discussed<br />\nwith him my plans for writing this<br />\nstory. I felt an obligation to say<br />\nother things for the record.<br />\nAll the incoming Beta pledges<br />\nwere more than willing to do the<br />\nwork necessary to clean up that<br />\n\"lovely old house.\" They never<br />\nhad a chance to. Even if only a<br />\ndozen or so decided to live there,<br />\nBeta could have slid by another<br />\nyear hoping that the long awaited<br />\nalumni money would come<br />\nthrough. And who's to say how<br />\nmany other Betas would have<br />\nmoved in during the year? The<br />\nquestions seem to be moot since<br />\nthe fraternity has taken the course<br />\nwhich may lead to a not so<br />\nglorious end.<br />\nBut there may still.be a sliver of<br />\nhope. Not all the depledged<br />\npledges have lost interest, at least<br />\nnot yet. And I'm sure there are<br />\nsome bitter Betas out there quite<br />\nticked off because of what's<br />\nhappened to Beta.<br />\nlo<br />\nI think that anyone who ever<br />\nwalked through the front door of<br />\nthat house to attend a Beta<br />\nblowout could ever forget what<br />\n, Beta hospitality was like. And who<br />\n1<br /><br />\ncould deny that Beta Theta Pi had<br />\nthe all-time most rowdy parties? If<br />\nHopkins loses Beta, it won't be<br />\nsuch a tremendous loose to<br />\nnon-Betas, (there are still other<br />\nfraternities which will each absorb<br />\nthe clientele which once<br />\npatronized Beta affairs), but it will<br />\nbe a blow to Harry Gotwals, our<br />\nFaculty advisor who was willing to<br />\nstump for us since his rise to that<br />\nposition, old Betas who<br />\nremembered the way it was only a<br />\nshort year ago and the new Betas<br />\nwho wanted to be part of a real<br />\nnon-lunch fraternity.<br />\nPoor Condition<br />\nI don't think its all over yet.<br />\nThere is probably no way to<br />\nreopen the house considering the<br />\npoor condition of the place but<br />\nmaybe the still interested Beta<br />\nde-pledges can get together and do<br />\nsomething.<br />\nLet's not let our Beta character<br />\nof not giving a damn allow us to let<br />\nBeta slip away.

It looks like another<br />\ngood year for Coach Dennis<br />\nCox's charges, who are<br />\ncontinuing in the fine Hopkins<br />\nfootball tradition which has seen<br />\nthe past three teams compile 6-3<br />\nrecords.<br />\nThe offensive unit was hit<br />\nhardest by graduation with 6<br />\nstarters 'departing, including the<br />\nentire starting backfield. The key<br />\nloss will, of course, be<br />\nquarterback Jack Thomas. As<br />\nwell as being a fine versatile<br />\nathlete (he handled the kicking<br />\n'chores in addition to the QB's<br />\njob) Thomas was also a great<br />\nleader and that is going to be a<br />\nhard quality to replace. Coach<br />\nCox, hOwever, appears to have<br />\nfound some very capable<br />\nreplacements for the graduated<br />\nstaters.<br />\nThree quarterback prospects<br />\nare in the running to lead the<br />\nBlue Jays multiple formation<br />\noffense. Bill Norbeck the only<br />\nmember of the trio returning<br />\nfrom last year's team, looks to<br />\nhave the inside track on the<br />\nstarting jOb. At 6'3\", 180<br />\nNorbeck runs and throws well<br />\nand gained valuable game<br />\nexperience, last season. Pressing<br />\nNorbeck for the starting spot are<br />\nDave Emala, a freshman and<br />\nGeorge Keckeison, a junior.<br />\nKeckeison played as a freshman<br />\nand this will be starting his<br />\nsecond season in a Blue Jay<br />\nuniform.<br />\nEmala, from Gilman' School<br />\nhere in Baltimore, is a fine punter<br />\nas well as an outstanding<br />\nquarterback prospect. He'll<br />\nprobably handle the punting<br />\nchores for the Homewood eleven<br />\nthis year as well as backing<br />\nNorbeck.<br />\nCoach Cox has instituted an<br />\noffensive change this season.<br />\nInstead of operating from a<br />\nfour-back backfield (quarterback<br />\nand three running backs) with<br />\nonly one wide receiver, the Jays<br />\nwill be using a 3-back backfield<br />\nand two wide receivers.<br />\nReturning sophomore Sam Matz,<br />\n5'11\", 195, will draw the starting<br />\nassignment at fullback. \"Sam's<br />\nimproved 100 percent over last<br />\nyear,\" said Cox, \"He's looked<br />\nexcellent.\" Backing up Matz will<br />\nbe the two starting inside<br />\nlinebackers (all Blue Jay players<br />\nlearn two positions), Bob<br />\nMaimone and Franz<br />\nWit telsberger. Freshman John<br />\nCoad has been switched from<br />\noffensive tackle to fullback to<br />\ninsure the Jays good depth at<br />\nthat position.<br />\nThere are two fine prospects<br />\nrunning out of the tailback spot<br />\nand Coach Cox plans to make use<br />\nof both of them. Sophomore<br />\nMike Rhodey returns from last<br />\nyear's squad where he played left<br />\nhalfback. Shifted to tailback in<br />\nthis year's offense, Cox said of<br />\nthe 6'1\", 190 pound Rhodey,<br />\n\"He's improved a lot over last<br />\nyear.\" Sharing the spot with<br />\nRhodey will be outstanding<br /><br />\nfreshman Steve DeVeas. DeVeas,<br />\n5'11\", 190, was a 1st\"am<br />\nMaryland High School All-Star<br />\nselection and has looked very<br />\ngood so far. Supplying additional<br />\ndepth at tailback is Fran<br />\nWeigmann who Cox called \"the<br />\nbest dive back on the team.\"<br />\nAt wide receiver, the<br />\ngraduation of \"Super Gnat\" Billy<br />\nNolan, the leading receiver in the<br />\nentire state of Maryland (Thomas<br />\nwas the leading passer), is no<br />\nsmall hole to fill. Tom Cirillo<br />\nlooks to be the starting flanker in<br />\nthe new 2 wide receiver offense.<br />\nThis represents a shift for Cirillo<br />\nwho was a running back last year<br />\nbut has shown good hands and<br />\ngood speed this year in making<br />\nthe move to flanker.<br />\nBasketballer Greg Delong<br />\nreturns to action on the gridiron<br />\nfor the first time since high<br />\nschool and looks to use his 6'4\",<br />\n195 pound frame to good<br />\nadvantage. Backing him up are<br />\nJoey Devlin, 5'7\", 170 and Bruce<br />\nBaillie, 6.1\", 190.<br />\nThe offensive line appears to<br />\nbe the real proven strength of<br />\nthis year's attacking unit. \"We<br />\nhave excellent linemen ,\" Cox.<br />\nsaid, \"and we really expect them<br />\nto do a job.\" Five out of six<br />\nstarters return, with center the<br />\nonly open spot. Scott Smith is<br />\nthe returning tight end. He took<br />\nover for the injured Mike Bogdan<br />\nin the fourth game of the year<br />\nlast season and finished the year<br />\nup in fine style. The 6'1\", 205<br />\npounder is an excellent receiver<br />\nand a fine blocker.

The interview was<br />\nconducted Wednesday, September 11,<br />\nand concerns those issues with which<br />\nColmers will deal this year as<br />\nOmbudsman\u2014pass-fail policy, course<br />\nofferings, and student interaction with<br />\nthe Deans.<br />\nNews-Letter: In what areas do you<br />\nplan to concentrate this academic year as<br />\nOmbudsman?<br />\nColmers: Two areas. The first is dealing<br />\ndirectly with students and their academic<br />\nproblems, the second is in broader areas<br />\nconcerning work with the curriculum and<br />\nchanges in the'academic prop-am.<br />\nN-L: How much influence do you<br />\nreally have as regards the Deans and their<br />\ndecisions?<br />\n\u2022 Colmers: I'm really nothing more than<br />\njust somebody with easy access to the<br />\n.Deans. Any weight that the office carries<br />\n.comes from how effectively I can express<br />\nthe needs of the students to the Deans.<br />\nN-L: But will they listen to you? Will<br />\nthey attribute any importance to what<br />\nyou say?<br />\nColmers: I think if a matter is not<br />\ntrivial and I present it sincerely, they'll<br />\nlisten. But then again, what they do is a<br />\ndifferent story. I know that the Deans<br />\nwon't be in favor of everything that I'm<br />\nin favor of. But I'm sure that I'll be<br />\nlistened to on just about any topic.<br />\nN-L: Do you have any regrets that<br />\nstudents were not allowed any<br />\nparticipation in the selection of .the<br />\nOmbudsman?<br />\nColmers: I certainly think that in the<br />\nfuture\u2014nothing can be done now\u2014I'd<br />\nwelcome as much participation on the<br />\npart of the students as the Deans will<br />\npermit.<br />\nN-L: In making decisions, -whose<br />\nperspective will you adopt\u2014that of the<br />\nDeans, whose office pays your salary, or<br />\nthat ofthe students?<br />\nColmers: No question. Being a student,<br />\nI'll have a student interests foremost in<br />\nmind. That's what I bring to the office. I<br />\ntry to bring the point of view of someone<br /><br />\nJohn Colmers<br />\nwho is a student at\u2022Hopkins and has had<br />\nproblems with the system.<br />\nN-L: Referring back to your plans for<br />\nthis year, what specific changes are you<br />\ngoing to work for?<br />\n\u2022<br />\nColmers: I have no specific plans yet,<br />\nbut if I see something that's obviously a<br />\nhindrance to students and has a broad<br />\nbase of students against it, then I'll get to<br />\nwork on it. I'm not going to sit back, if<br />\nstudents are clamoring for change, and<br />\nsay \"that's the way it is.\" As far as<br />\nacademics go, the CUS [the Committee<br />\non Undergraduate Studies] is the major<br />\narea for undergraduate input. I foresee.<br />\nmyself workibg, with the undergraduates<br />\non the CUS in whatever capacity I can.<br />\nN-L: Since the limits and powers of the<br />\nOmbudsman position have never' been<br />\nofficially decided upon, much less 'set<br />\ndown, are you going to expand upon the<br />\npowers Shep Hoffman exercised as<br />\nOmbudsman last year?<br />\nColmers: I think I'd like to .see the<br /><br />\noffice be one that can work with the CUS<br />\nand the Student Council to bring about<br />\nacademic change. I think I can bring to<br />\nthe position my experience with the<br />\nStudent Council and hopefully bring new<br />\nideas to the front.<br />\nN-L: What is your opinion on the<br />\npass-fail policy for first semester<br />\nfreshman? Did you favor tile old<br />\n\"airtight\" policy or the new, more<br />\nflexible one?<br />\nColmers: I think the old system was<br />\ntoo rigid. But the attempt to change it<br />\nlast year was done in a bush league way.<br />\nThe University had an obligation to the<br />\nstudents who started on the original<br />\nsystem. I think the new system for this<br />\nyear's Freshmen could alleviate some of<br />\nthe problems of the old one. There are<br />\ndifficulties with pass- fail policy because<br />\nthere simply isn't enough documentation<br />\nto go on. A lot of supposition on<br />\neveryone's part comes into play.<br />\nThere was a problem with the old<br />\n\"airtight\" system. If this new system can<br />\nbe flexible enough to allow for the<br />\nsuccessful review of individual cases,<br />\nthere will have been a big improvement.<br />\nToo many people were treated unfairly<br />\nby the old, unyielding system\u2014students<br />\ngraduating early, scholarship. applicants,<br />\nand so on.<br />\nN-L: But didn't the changes in the<br />\npass-fail policy do damage to its original<br />\npurpose, which was to give the freshmen<br />\ntime to adjust by assuring them that their<br />\nfirst semester grades Would never be<br />\nreleased? The new system's flexibility<br />\nremoves that security, doesn't it?<br />\nColmers: First, you have to go back<br />\nand see why the old policy was \"airtight\"<br />\nin the first place. It wasn't done so that<br />\npeople could screw around for their<br />\nentire first semester here. It was done so<br />\nthat people could get used to being away<br />\nfrom home, the rigors of college life, etc.<br />\nBeing ,realistic, the medical schools are<br />\ninterested in only two grades\u2014chemistry<br />\nand calculus, so the freshmen have leeway<br />\nwith the Other grades. Plus those are<br />\ncourses which continue into the second<br />\nsemester so you have to do well first<br />\nsemester in order to be able to continue<br />\nsuccessfully. I think the new system, if<br />\npeople look at it in the right light, still<br />\noffers people,the chance to get used to<br />\nHo kins.<br /><br />\nN-L: How doyou feel about the<br />\nreinstitution of the Dean's List?<br />\nColmers: I don't think it's any good.<br />\nAcademics should be their own reward. It<br />\nwill tend to increase competitiveness<br />\nhere. I just think that if you do well, your<br />\nreward should be the knowledge that you<br />\nattained. There already are . ancillary<br />\nawards. For example, if you do well, your<br />\nchances for acceptance at graduate school<br />\nare enhance.<br />\nN-L: Do you agree with nwst<br />\nundergraduates that course offerings here<br />\nare insufficient? If you do, what do you<br />\nplan to do about it from your position?<br />\nColmers: I do think that certain<br />\ndepartments\u2014which will go unnamed<br />\nhere\u2014have not offered as many or .as<br />\nvaried undergraduate courses as they<br />\nshould, both introductory and 300-level<br />\ncourses. What to do about it is a<br />\ncompletely different story. I think<br />\nundergraduate pressure really is a key<br />\npoint here. If enough undergraduates go<br />\nto a department chairman and ask \"Why<br />\nisn't there such and such a course? It's<br />\nvital to this discipline,\" something will be<br />\ndone. They won't remain deaf to<br />\ncomplaints. Courses come from the<br />\nprofessors themselves. Before Dick Cone<br />\nof Biophysics offered Physiology last<br />\nyear, there had never been an<br />\nintroductory undergraduate course in<br />\nthat subject in my years here. He found<br />\nhithself with Remsen I filled with<br />\nstudents. The same With Botany. It's a<br />\nmajor part of Biology, but until this year<br />\nit was never offered to undergraduates at<br />\nan introductory level while I've been<br />\nhere. These courses came out as a<br />\nresponse to the undergraduates.<br />\nN-L: Then there is hope, you think?<br />\nColmers: There's hope, but unless<br />\nstudents make their wishes know, and<br />\nthis can be done through my position, the<br />\nCUS or the Student Council, I don't<br />\nthink there's going to be a major increase<br />\nin the number or type of courses offered.<br />\nN-L: Are students -correct in their<br />\nbelief that Deans Owen and Suskind are<br />\nsomewhat disaffected, oblivious to the<br />\ndesires of undergraduates?<br />\nConners: I realize that students get<br />\nthat impression, but I don't think it's<br />\ntrue. I think both of them make an<br />\nhonest and sincere effort to keep in touch<br />\nwith what students want.<br /><br />\nWhere To Buy.
