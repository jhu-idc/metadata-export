Kent<br />\nMemorial Lecture, held Wednesday evening in Shriver Hall. The<br />\n45-minute talk discussed the<br />\nrelationship between the news<br />\nmedia and politics.<br />\nAfter being introduced by<br />\nUniversity President Steven<br />\nMuller, Mudd opened his speech<br />\nwith a series of mock news<br />\nbulletins. \"President Carter has<br />\njust proposed merging the CIA<br />\nand the Postal Service,\" Mudd<br />\nannounced, \"since they already<br />\nopen our mail, they might as<br />\nwell deliver it.\" Mudd told of<br />\nSenator Edward Kennedy feeling<br />\nso hard-pressed for campaign<br />\nfunds that he had resorted to<br />\nsoliciting contributions at BWI<br />\nairport, and the Chrysler Corporation merging with New<br />\nYork City to form an entity<br />\ncalled \"The Big Lemon\".<br />\nMudd opened the serious<br />\nportion of his talk by saying he<br />\nhad long been troubled by what<br />\nhe termed the \"Hollywood -star<br />\nreaction\" of the public and<br />\n<br />\npoliticians to network reporters.<br />\n\"We are seen far differently by<br />\nthe public than we see ourselves,\" he explained. \"People<br />\nview us as either saviors or<br />\nsinners.\"<br />\nMudd told the audience that<br />\nthe first indication of the change<br />\nin the media's role \"from<br />\nspectator to player\" was the<br />\n1964 Republican National Convention at the Cow Palace in San<br />\nFrancisco, where many delegates<br />\nhooted and shook their fists at<br />\nnetwork anchormen during a<br />\nspeech which criticized the press<br />\nby former President Dwight D.<br />\nEisenhower.<br />\nThe Vietnam War further<br />\ntransformed relations between<br />\nthe media and government,<br />\naccording to Mudd. \"During<br />\nand after the war, we distrusted<br />\nthe government more and the<br />\ngovernment came to fear us,\" he<br />\nsaid. \"It got to the point where<br />\nVice President Agnew in the<br />\ninfamous Des Moines speech<br />\ncould call newsmen 'nattering<br />\nnabobs of negativism.' Of<br />\ncourse, we all know what<br />\nhappened to him.\"<br />\nMudd said the effect of the<br />\ncont, on p. 6<br />\n<br />\nA wave of vandalism plaguing<br />\nthe Homewood campus has<br />\ngrown to epidemic proportions<br />\nover the past few weeks, and has<br />\ncaused the closing of at least one<br />\nbuilding to nighttime student<br />\nactivities.<br />\nThe worst destruction occurred on Saturday, March 15,<br />\nwhen Remsen, Shriver, and<br />\nGilman Halls all sustained subdamages.<br />\nstantial<br />\nIn Remsen, where a Weekend<br />\nWonder Flix film was being<br />\nshown in the basement lecture<br />\nhall, vandals apparently broke a<br />\nwater spigot in an unlocked<br />\nCampus<br />\nsecond floor lab.<br />\nSecurity was alerted after the<br />\nleak was discovered by a graduate student working in the<br />\nbuilding.<br />\nSome doubt has been expressed by workers in the<br />\nbuilding concerning Security's<br />\nactions at that point. It reportedly took 20 minutes for<br />\nofficers to respond to the call,<br />\nand another four hours before<br />\nthe leak was sealed off.<br />\nIn any case, five rooms were<br />\ndamaged on three floors, as the<br />\nwater dripped down to the<br />\nbasement. Major repairs were<br />\nnecessary in three of those<br />\nrooms, with ceilings, walls and<br />\ncarpeting all needing to be<br />\nreplaced. Certain fils and other<br />\noffice equipment were also lost.<br />\nThe estimated damage to Remsen Hall alone on that night is<br />\n$5000.<br />\nRemsen has not been the<br />\nonly building to be vandalized.<br />\nThat same night, all the restroom areas in the basement of<br />\nShriver were damaged. Lavatories, toilet seats and dividers were<br />\nall pulled out, said Security<br />\nDaytime Supervisor Mel Widom-<br />\n<br />\nski. The repair bill here was<br />\nestimated at $500. Again, vandals gained access to the building<br />\nbecause a film was being shown<br />\nin Shriver Auditorium by the<br />\nOffice of Special Events.<br />\nOn that same night, the<br />\nreceiver was pulled out of a<br />\nrecently-installed pay phone<br />\noutside Levering Hall. The inside<br />\nof the building sustained some<br />\ndamages also. The Student Union is regularly hit by vandals--usually drunken Rathskel-.<br />\nlar patrons. Recent destruction<br />\nhas included damage to bathroom fixtures in the first floor<br />\nmen's room (March 16), paint<br />\nsplashed on the wall of the film<br />\nworkshop near the Rat (March<br />\n22), a window th the game room<br />\nbroken (March 24), and the<br />\ndouble door to the film workshop broken (March 29). The<br />\npay phone and a bulletin boar,d<br />\nnear it are destroyed \"every<br />\nweekend,\" stated Widomski.<br />\nAlso on March 15, a sledgehammer was used to smash in<br />\nthe Easy Bank in Gilman Hall.<br />\nAll of this destruction has<br />\ncaused a side effect which is seen<br />\n<br />\nto be felt by the student body.<br />\nUse of Remsen's lecture hall as a<br />\nfilm theater, or for that matter<br />\nany after hours non-academic<br />\nactivity in the building, has been<br />\nbanned. Some 19 activities,<br />\nincluding lectures and films<br />\nshown by both WWF and the<br />\nReel World, have been either<br />\ncancelled or moved to a different location as a result of the<br />\nban.<br />\nA double screening, \"Up in<br />\nSmoke\" and \"Reefer Madness\",<br />\nis scheduled for April 11 and 12<br />\nin Remsen. Neil Katin, a chairperson of the Student Council<br />\nend of the film series, said that<br />\nhe will either run the films in the<br />\nlecture hall in Maryland Hall,<br />\nwhich is half the size of the<br />\nRemsen auditorium, or cancel<br />\nthem. \"They reserved the Listening-Viewing Room and the<br />\nGreat Hall (both in the Student<br />\nUnion), but you can't show a<br />\nfilm in the L-V Room because<br />\nyou can't compete with the Rat<br />\nand the Great Hall isn't much<br />\nKatin.<br />\nbetter,\"<br />\nclaimed<br />\nThe Chaplain's Office, which<br />\ncont. on p. 3<br />\n<br />\nDrinking Age Hike<br />\nDefeated In House<br />\nBY PETER CINQUEGRANI<br />\nThe House of Delegates and<br />\nthe House Judiciary Committee<br />\nhave defeated a bill that would<br />\nhave raised the drinking age for<br />\nbeer and wine from 18 to 19.<br />\nThe Senate had already passed<br />\nthe measure 34 to 10.<br />\nThe<br />\nbill's<br />\nproponents<br />\nclaimed that raising the age to<br />\n19 would take beer out of the<br />\nhigh schools, many of which<br />\n<br />\nNRC Meeting Considers TM!Clean-Up<br />\nBY HARRY LERNER<br />\nSome 500 people filled<br />\n\"Remsen 1 to take part in a<br />\n\"scoping meeting\" conducted by<br />\nthe Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) on March 20.

There are 90 days in<br />\nwhich to consider over 3000<br />\nbills. They have to rely on what<br />\nother people tell them in order<br />\nto decide how to vote.<br />\nThe most important source<br />\nof information for legislators,<br />\nand the single thing that can<br />\nensure that a bill will be killed is<br />\nits \"Fiscal Note\". This is a<br />\nposition paper prepared by fiscal<br />\nanalysts, one for each committee<br />\nof the legislature, which tries to<br />\ndetermine how much the bill<br />\nwill cost the state in each of the<br />\nnext three years. The notes are<br />\nthe same size as the bills and are<br />\nthe same binders. VVIIGH<br />\nV<br />\ntelblett<br />\n<br />\nthe Delegate turns to the bill in<br />\nhis book he sees what the<br />\nanalyst thinks it will cost.<br />\nWhether the note says the<br />\nbill will cost a great deal or only<br />\na little or nothing goes a long<br />\nway to determining whether it<br />\nwill pass. Also, it is possible for<br />\nan analyst to change the<br />\namounts in the note by changing<br />\nthe assumptions he uses in<br />\nwriting it. If he does not like the<br />\nbill he can use worst-case<br />\nassumptions and give it a very<br />\nhigh cost, or if he likes it he can<br />\nshave the cost as much as<br />\npossible.<br />\nThe next most important<br />\nthings to delegates deciding how<br />\nto vote are the positions the<br />\nvarious departments of the government take on measures that<br />\naffect their areas.<br />\nIf the<br />\nDepartment of Transportation<br />\nopposes a bill about state<br />\nhighways it will be almost<br />\nimpossible to pass. Once again<br />\nthese positions are printed the<br />\nin n<br />\n<br />\nR<br />\n<br />\nlevel resent having to make up for, or<br />\nadjust to, the defects of a secondary<br />\nschool system which is increasingly<br />\ngeared towards the turning out of<br />\npre-bureaucrats. Nevertheless, until the<br />\nmovement, which<br />\n\"back-to-basics\"<br />\nseems to be making modest headway in<br />\nsome American high schools, becomes<br />\nmore effective, the universities will have<br />\nto bridge the gaps. The Core Curriculums. which have recently appeared<br />\nat Hopkins stem from a recognition of<br />\nthe problem and represent a step in the<br />\nright direction. More of this same type<br />\nof thinking is needed if mediocrity is not<br />\nto characterize the humanists of the 21st<br />\nCentury.<br />\nFor the moment, appropriate<br />\ncourses from the Classics department, as<br />\nwell as a course in the Bible-as-literature,<br />\nshould be incorporated into the mandatory curriculum of most liberal arts<br />\nFor the future, such<br />\ndepartments.<br />\nbasic<br />\nof<br />\nre-thinking<br />\nrequirements should<br />\ncharacterize all departments of the<br />\nUniversity.<br />\n<br />\nLetters To The Editor<br />\nOpen It Up<br />\n<br />\nPhoto Staff<br />\nPeter Choo<br />\nStephanie Kretchmer<br />\nAnne McElwee<br />\n<br />\nWhen the students in the English,<br />\nHistory, Writing Seminars, and Humanities departments are added together,the<br />\nresult is a fairly large number of people<br />\nwho are involved, directly or indirectly,<br />\nin the study of literature. All four of the<br />\nabove departments are renowned for<br />\ntheir excellence, but there is a pervasive<br />\nproblem which prevents many students<br />\nfrom mining them for all they are worth.<br />\nToday, liberal education is making<br />\nassumptions about students which are<br />\nno longer valid. Unlike his counterpart<br />\nof a half-century ago, the average incoming freshman of today enters college<br />\nwithout a basic knowledge of either<br />\nclassical mythology or the Bible. As a<br />\nresult, more than a few professors<br />\ndespair over having to painstakingly<br />\nexplicate the wealth of mythological and<br />\nBiblical allusions which are pervasive in<br />\nall phases of world literature and art. At<br />\nthe same time, the student's grasp of the<br />\nintegrity and permanence of our cultural<br />\ninheritance is seriously weakened.<br />\nMany educators at the college<br />\n<br />\nI agree completely with<br />\nBruce Smith's letter in the<br />\nlast News-Letter questioning<br />\nclosed meetings. As a Freshman<br />\nRepresentative to the Student<br />\nCouncil I have opposed closed<br />\nmeeting and have voted against<br />\nthem. I also oppose the proposed change in the Constitution<br />\nmaking it easier for the S.C. to<br />\nclose meetings.<br />\nI think the Student Council<br />\nshould do everything it can to<br />\ninform their peers about all<br />\nissues which concern them. If a<br />\nS.C. member isn't doing his or<br />\nher job, the people who elected<br />\nus should have the right to<br />\nknow. If someone's character is<br />\nbeing questioned, the students<br />\nthemselves, rather than Council<br />\nmembers, should be the judge.<br />\nWe should make every<br />\neffort to find out student views.<br />\nBefore Spring Break I took an<br />\ninformal poll in the dorm<br />\ncafeteria to find out what<br />\nstudents think about closed<br />\nmeetings. I polled 124 people at<br />\nThe results were:<br />\nrandom.<br />\n100 were against closed<br />\nmeetings<br />\n12 said there may be a need<br />\nfor them when the situation<br />\nwarrants<br />\n12 were either undecided or<br />\nhad no opinion. Of the twelve<br />\npeople who saw a need for<br />\nclosed meetings four said a<br />\nunanimous vote should be<br />\nrequired to close a meeting.<br />\nTwo people said 6/7, four said<br />\n3/4, and two said 2/3.<br />\nAdmittedly, this poll sample<br />\nis small but it does give a good<br />\nindication of student opinion.<br />\nikAnv neonle ask why the<br />\n<br />\nStudent Council is spending so<br />\nmuch time arguing about a<br />\nminor issue like closed meetings<br />\nwhen there is so much important<br />\nwork we could be doing. I agree<br />\nthat the issue by itself is minor,<br />\nbut closed meetings undermine<br />\nthe legitimacy of the Student<br />\nCouncil. To lobby for any<br />\nimportant change in this University we need strong student<br />\nsupport. In order to rally strong<br />\nstudent support behind us we<br />\nmust gain student trust and<br />\nTo make the<br />\nconfidence.<br />\nCouncil a truly representative<br />\nbody we have to become more<br />\naccessible to everyone. That<br />\nalso means we can't hide from<br />\nthe News-Letter ,What is there to<br />\nfear if the students know we are<br />\ndoing our job?<br />\nThe Student Council has a<br />\nright to exist only as long as it<br />\nrepresents the students. Anything else is a farce and a<br />\nperversion of the job the S.C.<br />\nwas established to do.<br />\n<br />\ninterests. concerning student activities. Thanks Amy.<br />\n<br />\nAs far as student activities<br />\ngo - they may soon, in fact, be<br />\ngone.

Increased and improved<br />\nsecurity forces may be one<br />\nanswer but this problem is<br />\ngetting bigger.

The sponsoring<br />\ncommittee was formed by Dr..<br />\nNorman Forer, a professor of<br />\nscience.<br />\nat<br />\nthe<br />\npolitical<br />\nUniversity of Kansas. \"The purpose of the trip,\" said Diehl,<br />\n\"was to get people outside the<br />\ngovernment involved in understanding the basis of the Iranian<br />\ncrises.\"<br />\nHe then went on to describe<br />\nhow he and approximately fifty<br />\nother American citizens were<br />\nselected to travel to Iran last<br />\nFebruary and allowed to go<br />\nanywhere they wished. Diehl<br />\nsaid that contrary to the<br />\nimpression one may get from the<br />\ntelevision news, things are very<br />\norderly in Iran. \"Things proceeded normally as in any large<br />\ncity.\" He also stated that the<br />\nIranian people were very friendly towards him and his companions.<br />\n\"Iranians believe that most<br />\nAmericans were not informed<br />\nabout the goings on in Iran until<br />\nrecently,\" said Diehl, adding<br />\n\"Taking hostages woke people<br />\nup to what was happening. The<br />\nstudents brought attention to<br />\ntheir country, but aren't getting<br />\ntheir message across.\"<br />\nAlthough Diehl himself did<br />\nnot meet with any of the hostages, eleven of them visiting<br />\nAmericans were allowed to meet<br />\nwith two of them and related<br />\nOne<br />\ntheir stories to the rest.<br />\nhostage said that he was shocked<br />\nthat the American government<br />\nhadn't returned the Shah after<br />\nthe embassy was taken over.<br />\nAnother said that he felt that<br />\nthe \"students' demands were<br />\ntoo idealistic.\"<br />\nFollowing his lecture, Diehl<br />\nanswered questions from the<br />\naudience. Although there were<br />\nonly sixteen people present,<br />\n<br />\nthere was active audience participation. This was typified by<br />\ntwo Iranian students who were<br />\ngiving their opinions and describing what it was like living in<br />\nIran. The discussion was dominated by these two for some time<br />\nwhile each recounted his tale.<br />\nOne told of how some friends<br />\nwho had been reading the<br />\n\"wrong\" type of book had been<br />\nreported and subsequently taken<br />\nfrom their homes at gunpoint by<br />\nSAVAK, the Iranian secret police, and dropped from a plane<br />\ninto some lake and never heard<br />\nfrom again. He considers the<br />\nAyatollah Khomeini a \"a very,<br />\nvery great man,\" and believes<br />\nthat after Khomeini dies, there<br />\nwill be another complete revolution. He said that the Islamic<br />\ngovernment would, in his opinion, last only about one or-two<br />\nmore years.<br />\nAs the discussion continued,<br />\nmembers of the audience<br />\nappeared quite opinionated and<br />\nknowledgeable<br />\nin<br />\nmatters<br />\nconcerning the hostage situation<br />\nand in allowing the Shah to<br />\ncome to America. It was pointed out that the United States<br />\ndoes not pay blackmail for its<br />\nambassadors and that while the<br />\nembassy was being overrun, the<br />\nMarine<br />\nguards<br />\ntold<br />\nthe<br />\nAmericans in the building not to<br />\nshow any signs of aggression and<br />\nthat help would soon be on the<br />\nway. There was made mention<br />\nof the fact that U.S. Marines<br />\nguarding embassies are supposed<br />\nto detain the onrushing crowds<br />\nby tear gas and other non-lethal<br />\nmeans long enough for secret<br />\ndocuments to be destroyed.<br />\nAfter the lecture was over, a<br />\nfew of the more interested<br />\nparticipants talked with Diehl<br />\nand tried to find out if he<br />\nthought the initial tying up of<br />\nthe hostages was justified. He<br />\nsaid that although he couldn't<br />\nfind justification in this act, he<br />\ndid find it understandable.<br />\nSome members of the<br />\naudience felt that Diehl was<br />\nrather \"one-sided\" in<br />\nhis<br />\n<br />\nD.C.

CHARLES ST<br />\nBALTIMORE. MO 21201<br />\n<br />\nR PETTUS<br />\n<br />\nI am writing in response to<br />\nMarguerite R. Vansant's letter,<br />\nCaged Canines. To begin with, I<br />\nam not \"anyone who dislikes<br />\nanimals.\" Quite the contrary, I<br />\nam a concerned human being, a<br />\nstudent at Goucher College and,<br />\ncurrently, an intern with the<br />\nMaryland SPCA (society for the<br />\nprevention of Cruelty to Animals)in Baltimore.<br />\nPersonally, I own six dogs<br />\nand, yet, I must still agree with<br />\nthe \"someone(who)complained<br />\nabout the dogs on campus.\" As<br />\na dog lover, I am forever concerned with the humane treatment of animals, in this case,<br />\ndogs. By humane treatment, I<br />\nmean the love and responsibility<br />\nthat man owes his dog.<br />\nStudents are not being responsible dog owners when they<br />\nallow their dogs to run loose on<br />\nthe Johns Hopkins University<br />\nCampus. An unleashed dog can<br />\nbe hit by a car, can become lost,<br />\ncan be stolen, can be attacked<br />\nby ill-meaning children or other<br />\ndogs, can deface public and<br />\nprivate property, defile the sidewalks and, without meaning to,<br />\ncan scare people who are afraid<br />\nof dogs. (This segment of the<br />\npopulation is greater than one<br />\nmight think.)<br />\nthe dogConsequently,<br />\ncatchers are really doing a<br />\nservice for all members of<br />\nsociety: the students, the dogs<br />\nand all others. By corralling the<br />\n<br />\n()<br />\n()<br />\n()<br />\n0<br />\n()<br />\n<br />\ndogs that run loose on the<br />\ncampus, the dogcatchers and the<br />\npeople who complain are, in<br />\nreality, the humane individuals.<br />\nBecause of their efforts, less pets<br />\nturn up in the gutter along<br />\nCharles Street.<br />\nI love dogs and I love to see<br />\nthem where they belong \u2014<br />\nalongside their owners.

His brothers<br />\nvoted for Robert Kennedy.<br />\nBuskirk himself worked for<br />\n<br />\nbecause of his anti-nuclear positions. The only other candidate<br />\nwho was thought to have a<br />\nchance at reawakening the student vote was Kennedy.<br />\nYet in the first presidential<br />\ntest-in Iowa in January--students<br />\n<br />\nTHANK<br />\nYOU.<br />\n<br />\nGeorge McGovern in 1972 and<br />\nMorris Udall in 1976. According<br />\nto form, in 1980 Buskirk should<br />\nbe an Edward Kennedy supporter.<br />\nBut he's not.<br />\n\"The man is terrible,\" Buskirk groans. \"He's a damn liar.<br />\nHe just can't be trusted.\" So in<br />\nthe March 18 Illinois primary,<br />\nBuskirk became an example<br />\nof why students are voting for<br />\nJohn Anderson.<br />\nIn a survey of selected<br />\ncollege student precincts around<br />\nthe state, Anderson took a<br />\nwhopping 59% of the student<br />\nvote in the Republican primary.<br />\nOf all student voters in both<br />\nRepublican and Democratic primaries, Anderson outpolled his<br />\nnearest rival, Ronald Reagan, by<br />\nbetter than a two-to-one margin.<br />\nAnderson took 46% of all<br />\nstudent votes in Illinois.<br />\nOf all student votes cast,<br />\nReagan got 21%, while President<br />\nCarter got 14%.

Lumped together, the student vote in New<br />\nEngland gave Anderson a lead<br />\nover Bush. The ten-term Illinois<br />\ncongressman did not campaign<br />\nin the South, but managed to<br />\nattract student support anyway.<br />\nBy the time the presidential<br />\ncontest rolled into Illinois, the<br />\ncontest for student support was<br />\nnarrowed down to Kennedy and<br />\nIllinois, however,<br />\nAnderson.<br />\nillustrated the Massachusetts senator's inability to draw support<br />\nfrom what should be his natural<br />\nconstituency.<br />\nIn the days before the vote,<br />\nKennedy's campaigns at Chicago<br />\narea campuses were almost defunct. The explanations ranged<br />\nfrom a dislike of Kennedy's<br />\npersonality--\"He's ambitious just<br />\nlike the way Caesar called Brutus<br />\nambitious,\" Northwestern senior<br />\nJohn McGlocklin says\u2014to a certain student conservatism.<br />\n\"Students are conservative<br />\non economic issues,\" says Eileen<br />\nKelly, editor of Loyola University's student paper. \"Their<br />\nparents are very business-oriented, and Kennedy's economic<br />\npolicy would be catastrophic for<br />\nthem. I just believe students are<br />\n<br />\nSTILL HAVEN'T STARTED<br />\nTHAT PAPER?<br />\n<br />\n\"The reason students are<br />\ngoing for Anderson,\" Austin<br />\nhis<br />\nexplains, \"is because<br />\ncampaign is exciting.

Perhaps the mostfamous example is<br />\nEdgar Allan Poe, who reputedly passed away in a Baltimore gutter after downing one bourbon too many at a<br />\nparty. The other and less obvious of the two is F. Scott<br />\nFitzgerald. Off and on during the late 1920's and early<br />\n'30's, Scott and Zelda plus daughter E-gnces resided in<br />\nan apartment house that stood directly epporsite the<br />\nJohns Hopkins University. Now known as Wolman Hall,<br />\nthe building served as Fitzgerald's base while his wife<br />\nunderwent care at Baltimore's Shepherd Pratt Hospital.<br />\nFitzgerald died in Hollywood in 1940, did some writing<br />\n(and no doubt some drinking) at the apartment. The<br />\nmost notable of his Baltimore books, Afternoon of an<br />\nAuthor, speaks fondly of the city and its people.<br />\nI recently conducted this hasty bit of third-rate<br />\ndetective work after being told a rather interesting story<br />\nby one Ben Button, an acquaintance of mine and a<br />\nthird-year Humanities major who lives on the 4th floor<br />\nof Wolman. I asked him if he would care to jot down his<br />\ntale for the News-Letter's faithful readership; but, like<br />\nmost conscientious Hoppies, Ben avows that his studies<br />\ncome before anything as frivolous as the school newspaper. Perforce, I had to wheel and deal with him: if he'd<br />\ndictate his story to me, I'd buy him a few brews at the<br />\nRat some weekend in the near future. The price of<br />\nbeing an enterprising young reporter.<br />\nAnyway, to shorten an already too-long story, he<br />\naccepted. And so, without further to-do, the curious<br />\ncase of Ben Button, as told to yours truly, follows.<br />\nP.E.<br />\non a<br />\na.m.<br />\n2<br />\nwas<br />\nIt was Friday night. Actually,it<br />\nhome<br />\ngone<br />\nhad<br />\nroommate<br />\nSaturday morning. My<br />\nto Pennsylvania for the weekend, and I was just settling<br />\ninto bed after having spent several debauched hours as a<br />\nTEP soiree. I couldn't have been lying down for more<br />\nthan ten minutes when I heard a noise coming from<br />\noutside my bedroom door. The noise was rather faint at<br />\nfirst, but it steadily grew louder and clearer. It sounded<br />\nlike uneven, stumbling footsteps. Then I heard a voice<br />\nsinging a song about Valencia. It was unmistakably the<br />\nvoice of someone with more than a few drinks in him.<br />\nI began feeling somewhat afraid. I sat up in bed<br />\nand tentatively called out, \"Wh-wh-who's there?\"<br />\nSuddenly-I'm not even certain how to describe itsuddenly, a white blur came through my bedroom door.<br />\nThat is, the door was closed, bolted shut in fact, and this<br />\nblur (what appeared to be a human figure) came right<br />\nthrough the door. I blinked at it and stammered what<br />\nthe hell's going on\" two or three times.<br />\nThe figure began to assume a more distinct<br />\nshape. I couldn't believe what I was seeing, but there it<br />\nstood-the ghostly apparition of a man! An impeccably<br />\ndressed man at that: He sported an ascot, a handsome<br />\njacket, and knickers. I had never seen anyone wearing<br />\nknickers before. He also had a bottle in his hand.<br />\nHe stood there in the middle of my room,<br />\nswaying, looking around. I cowered in my bed and<br />\nblurted out,\"who are you?\"<br />\nHe wheeled about and faced me. \"Oh,hello, old<br />\nsport,\" he said, as if he hadn't noticed me until that<br />\nmoment. He was very charming, and most definitely<br />\nsloshed out of his skull. \"I see you've kept this place up<br />\nnice.\" He took a hit off his bottle.<br />\n\"Who are you? What are you doing in my<br />\nroom?\"<br />\n\"Who am I? Who am I?\" He seemed indignant.<br />\n\"You don't know who I am? Don't you recognize me?<br />\nHmmm? Go on, take a guess.\"<br />\nI was confused. On top of that, my head was not<br />\nin what might be called Grade A shape. I rubbed my<br />\neyes furiously.<br />\n\"Give up? Then I shall tell you.,\" he said. He<br />\nrested his bottle on the floor, folded his arms, and<br />\ncocked his head. He was still swaying. \"I...I am the<br />\nrenowned writer of short stories, novels, screenplays...<br />\nscribe of the Jazz Age... ex-patriot former drop-out of<br />\nPrinceton University, formerly of the United States<br />\nArmy...! am F. Scott-\" he belched \"Fitzgerald.\"<br />\nMy consternation was turning into anger. Moreover, I was tired, groggy,and still unsure just what I was<br />\ndealing with. Was it something I ate, drank, dreamed?<br />\n<br />\nSitting down at the desk, I fed a piece of paper<br />\ninto the typewriter and turned the machine on. Maybe<br />\nhumoring this guy was the best way to be rid of him.<br />\n\"Okay, what do you want to dictate?\"<br />\nHe began pacing. \"I intend to complete my great<br />\nunfinished novel, The Last Typhoon.\"<br />\n\"You mean The Last Tycoon, don't you?\"<br />\n\u2022<br />\n\"Precisely. Now then, let's see. Where did I<br />\nleave off? The last paragraph of the book, I believe, was,<br />\nuh...ah, yet: `Gatsby believed in the green light, the<br />\norgiastic future that year by year recedes before us.\"<br />\n\"Uh oh,\" I said, typing.<br />\n\"It eluded us then,\" he continued,\"but that'.s<br />\nno matter--tomorrow we will run faster, stretch our arms<br />\nfarther...And one fine morning-New paragraph, old<br />\nsport. So we beat on, boats against the current, borne<br />\nback ceaselessly into the past.\"<br />\nPausing, he took a long swig from his bottle.<br />\n\"Not bad, eh, old sport? Pity I had to pass on and leave<br />\nsuch magnificent stuff unended. Until now, that is.\"<br />\nHe started pacing again. \"Uh...Ceaselessly into the past.'<br />\nThat's where the book left off, correct? Alright,<br />\nuh...add this on old sport, and make sure you get the<br />\ndots and hyphens right: The past, hyphen,the faster we<br />\nrun towards it, dot, dot, dot, the farther our arms<br />\nstretch for it, dot, dot, hyphen, the farther it becomes.<br />\nIt eludes us still. The past remains the past.\"<br />\nAll of a sudden he stopped and grew rather<br />\npensive. He walked to the window. A few car horns<br />\nhonked in the distance.<br />\n\"Ah, Charles Street looks lovely tonight,\" he<br />\nsaid. It was almost a whisper. \"I remember once when<br />\nmy dear Hilda and I went to a splendid party in New<br />\nYork and we rode on the roof of the cab.\"<br />\n\"Wasn't your wife's name Zelda?\"<br />\n\"Of course it was. When we got to the hotel<br />\nwhere the party was being given, Hilda and I jumped<br />\ninto a huge fountain and started swimming. Before long,<br />\neveryone had jumped in.\" He chuckled softly to himself. In a way, I felt sorry for him, whoever he was.<br />\nCome to think of it, I thought to myself, who is he,<br />\nanyway? \"Those were the days, old sport. The only<br />\ntime to be alive...\"<br />\nAbout-facing abruptly, he staggered back to the<br />\nmiddle of the room. \"Well, so much for reminiscing.<br />\nIt's back to work. Right now my main concern is<br />\nfinishing The Last Tie-Pin.\"<br />\n\"Excuse me, Mister, uh...Fitzgerald.\"<br />\n\"Please, call me Scott.\"<br />\n\"....I'm sorry I yelled at you earlier.\"<br />\n\"No need to apologize, old sport. You had the<br />\nright. I suppose I was--am--indeed trespassing. It's just<br />\nthat occasionally I like to revisit some of my old stomping grounds, my old haunts...\"<br />\n\"Well, no hard feelings, huh? There is just one<br />\nthing, though, that I wanted to ask.\" For some reason I<br />\nwas having a hard time asking it. \"You remember<br />\nthe very first part you dictated? The green light and the<br />\nboats against the current? Isn't that the ending of The<br />\nGreat Gatsby?\"<br />\nHe lowered his head and clutched his bottle to<br />\nhis chest. \"Didn't fool you, eh, old sport,\" he said<br />\nquietly. \"I know, I know. I don't have it anymore.<br />\nWhen you haven't written in 40 years, you get a trifle<br />\nrusty. She warned me this would happen. She told me<br />\nI'd end up like this-a pie-eyed ex-writer, boring everyoneimposing myself upon people...\"<br />\n\"Who said that?\"<br />\n\"Hilda.\"<br />\n\"You mean Zelda.\"<br />\nI jumped out of my bed and stalked over to him.<br />\nI<br />\nbuddy.<br />\nI mean Hilda, my manicurist,\" he said.<br />\nlook,<br />\n\"No,<br />\nI was really getting steamed. \"Now<br />\nBut<br />\nare.<br />\nyou<br />\ndid I ever tell you about the party in<br />\nwho<br />\nsport,<br />\nold<br />\ncare<br />\ndon't<br />\n\"Say,<br />\nI<br />\ndon't know who you are.<br />\njumped into the...\" His voice trailed<br />\ndon't\"<br />\nwe<br />\nyou<br />\nif<br />\nwhen<br />\ncops<br />\nYork<br />\nthe<br />\nNew<br />\ncall<br />\nI'm<br />\nnow,<br />\ngonna<br />\nsecond<br />\nany<br />\n\"Do me a favor, old sport.\" He stood up and off. \"I'm sorry.\"<br />\nHe seemed a bit more clear-headed than when he<br />\nheld the chair out for me.\"Do the literary world a favor.<br />\nhad entered the apartment. Still clutching the bottle, he<br />\nDo mankind a favor!\"<br />\nmoved slowly towards the door. \"Old sport,\" he said,\"I<br />\n\"Huh?\"<br />\nto thank you for your hospitality.

It had to be one of those<br />\nthings. And if it was none of those things, then naturally, I told myself, it had to be the ghost of F. Scott<br />\nFitzgerald. Of course. What else?<br />\nWhatever it was, I wanted it out of my apartment. \"Look,\" I snapped, \"if you don't vacate my<br />\nroom in ten seconds, I'm calling Security.\"<br />\n\"Please, old sport,\" my visitor said, shooshing<br />\nme as he picked up his bottle. \"Let's not have a rhubarb.\" He turned around.

It was swift,<br />\nif not altogether sure.<br />\nJournalists feared the religionists aimed to turn<br />\nthe student-run Iowa State Daily, which the \"pub<br />\nboard\" controls, into a self-consciously Christian<br />\nmedium.<br />\nFaculty members of the board, worried<br />\nabout the ease with which a special interest group got<br />\ninto the position of control of the paper, announced<br />\na boycott of board meetings. The county government<br />\nsued on the Daily's behalf. And members of the KSU<br />\nBible Study Group, while protesting their innocence,<br />\nworried that the newspaper, in trying to stop special<br />\ninterest groups from doing the same thing in the future,<br />\nmay be discriminating agianst students on the basis<br />\nof their religion.<br />\nThough the Iowa State case is especially<br />\ndramatic, such controversies arise every spring, and<br />\nusually on more than one campus at a time. The<br />\nseasonal crop of April Fool's Day and humor issues<br />\nusually include material that one campus group or<br />\nanother finds offensive. The offended group, in turn,<br />\nwill raise the most difficult question in college<br />\njournalism: who should control the content of the<br />\nstudent newspaper?<br />\nAt Iowa State, of course, the controversy did not<br />\narise out of any expressions of newroom humor. But<br />\nmost of the precedents that could determine the<br />\noutcome of what Daily staffers call a conspiracy arose<br />\nout of controversies over \"joke journalism,\" according<br />\nto Mike Simpson of the Student Press Law Center in<br />\nWashington, D.C.<br />\nThe range of response was evident last spring. In<br />\nApril, for example, The Davidsonian, the student paper<br />\nat Davidson in North Carolina, published a satirical<br />\n\"Guide to Courses\"that was roundly criticized as<br />\ntasteless, especially by alumni and administrators.<br />\nBut the price of offending student newspaper<br />\nreaders is often higher. What Simpson describes as \"a<br />\nvery conservative group\" is sponsoring a referendum to<br />\ncut off student funding for the Daily Tarheal at the<br />\nUniversity of North Carolina-Chapel Hill.<br />\nNothing seems to cause controversy more readily<br />\n<br />\nthan humorous religious references in a student paper,<br />\nhowever. A University of Minnesota Daily mock<br />\ninterview with Jesus Christ was blasted as<br />\n\"anti-religious\" and \"racist\", and lead to yet another<br />\nfund cutoff referendum. It was recently defeated by a<br />\ntwo-to-one margin.<br />\nBut it was too much for critics to take last spring<br />\nwhen the Observation Post at the City University of New<br />\nYork published a picture of a woman in a scanty nun's<br />\nhabit masturbating with a crucifix. Students voted to<br />\ncut off the paper's funding in retaliation. The picture<br />\nalso brought on a bill in the New York legislature that<br />\nwould have cut off funding for student papers at all<br />\nstate schools. The bill actually passed the Senate, but<br />\nfailed in the House.<br />\nNo one has accused the Iowa State Daily of<br />\nobscenity, but critics have occasionally protested that<br />\nthe paper has failed to take a \"moral\" view of what to<br />\ninclude in the paper.<br />\nDaily Editor Vicki Shannon recalls getting<br />\nspecific criticism of an account of a campus rape, a story<br />\nabout life in Nigeria, and satires about fraternity and<br />\nsorority \"dirty rushing.\"<br />\nShannon had heard of the group before. She<br />\ndates the tensions between the paper and the religionists<br />\nto the group's attempt several years ago to get funding<br />\nfor a Bible Study Group-produced newspaper.

In part one, the cast is<br />\ndressed as ushers and ticket takers and<br />\nruns through a fast-paced revue of eleven<br />\noriginal songs in which they pay homage<br />\nto the films, dancers, and songwriters of<br />\nthe Depression decade. Occasionally,<br />\nsome old standard tunes like \"Thanks for<br />\nthe Memory\",\"Two Sleepy People\", and<br />\n\"Too Marvelous for Words\" pop up. The<br />\npresence of these classic songs, however,<br />\nonly serves to humble the too-often<br />\ncorny and cutesy show score composed<br />\nby Dick Vosburgh and Frank Lazarus.<br />\nThe same problem applies to the cast.<br />\nThough they are all genuinely talented<br />\nsingers and dancers, they are but pallid<br />\nimitations of the movie greats they seek<br />\nto conjure -- immortals like Fred Astaire,<br />\n% Ginger Rogers, Judy Garland, and Mickey<br />\n0<br />\n0<br />\n4<br />\nMouse. Asking a young Broadway actor'<br />\nto be Fred Astaire is probably asking too<br />\nmuch. Yet, when the cast brings up<br />\nAstaire, you automatically envision one<br />\nof the greatest dancers of the century. I<br />\nhate to be the one to say it, but this<br />\nyoung cast is not among that select group<br />\nof timeless hoofers.

The fear of<br />\nfailure becomes obsessive -- you start<br />\nhearing music in your sleep, humming it<br />\nin your head, playing your program for<br />\nanyone who is within earshot.<br />\nOf course, by the time the recital<br />\ncomes, neurosis has set in and you've<br />\nbecome insufferable to your classmates<br />\nand roommates.

With all this work<br />\nto do, perhaps they might wonder what<br />\ngoes on down that road at their affiliate<br />\ninsitution, the Peabody? It is not unusual<br />\nthat a Peabody student would get by with<br />\nonly 3 papers during their undergraduate<br />\ncareer, and studying for an exam is often<br />\nconsidered real dedication (or sometimes<br />\nfoolhardy). What do all those musicians<br />\ndo down there anyway? Let me assure<br />\nyou that although Peabody students<br />\ndon't have many papers, labs and exams,<br />\nwe have something much bigger, more<br />\nexciting, and much more terrifying: the<br />\ndegree recital.<br />\nEvery student at the Peabody is<br />\nrequired to give a recital his senior year.<br />\nA recital, for those of you who don't<br />\nknow, is a performance in which one<br />\nstudent, often with an accompanist, plays<br />\nprepared pieces for approximately one<br />\nhour in front of an audience of friends,<br />\npeers, and a faculty jury.

Under a new<br />\ncoach, Robert Babb, the Jays are<br />\nshowing steady improvement in<br />\nthe field and some superb<br />\npitching. Hopes of a division<br />\nchampionship hinge on upcoming games, but the Jays record so<br />\nfar (4-2-1) is indicative of a<br />\nstrong start.<br />\nThe Jays began their season<br />\nwith a bang by defeating Wilkes<br />\nCollege 54 in a dramatic ninth<br />\ninning comeback.

Kent<br />\nMemorial Lecture, held Wednesday evening in Shriver Hall. The<br />\n45-minute talk discussed the<br />\nrelationship between the news<br />\nmedia and politics.<br />\nAfter being introduced by<br />\nUniversity President Steven<br />\nMuller, Mudd opened his speech<br />\nwith a series of mock news<br />\nbulletins. \"President Carter has<br />\njust proposed merging the CIA<br />\nand the Postal Service,\" Mudd<br />\nannounced, \"since they already<br />\nopen our mail, they might as<br />\nwell deliver it.\" Mudd told of<br />\nSenator Edward Kennedy feeling<br />\nso hard-pressed for campaign<br />\nfunds that he had resorted to<br />\nsoliciting contributions at BWI<br />\nairport, and the Chrysler Corporation merging with New<br />\nYork City to form an entity<br />\ncalled \"The Big Lemon\".<br />\nMudd opened the serious<br />\nportion of his talk by saying he<br />\nhad long been troubled by what<br />\nhe termed the \"Hollywood -star<br />\nreaction\" of the public and<br /><br />\npoliticians to network reporters.<br />\n\"We are seen far differently by<br />\nthe public than we see ourselves,\" he explained. \"People<br />\nview us as either saviors or<br />\nsinners.\"<br />\nMudd told the audience that<br />\nthe first indication of the change<br />\nin the media's role \"from<br />\nspectator to player\" was the<br />\n1964 Republican National Convention at the Cow Palace in San<br />\nFrancisco, where many delegates<br />\nhooted and shook their fists at<br />\nnetwork anchormen during a<br />\nspeech which criticized the press<br />\nby former President Dwight D.<br />\nEisenhower.<br />\nThe Vietnam War further<br />\ntransformed relations between<br />\nthe media and government,<br />\naccording to Mudd. \"During<br />\nand after the war, we distrusted<br />\nthe government more and the<br />\ngovernment came to fear us,\" he<br />\nsaid. \"It got to the point where<br />\nVice President Agnew in the<br />\ninfamous Des Moines speech<br />\ncould call newsmen 'nattering<br />\nnabobs of negativism.' Of<br />\ncourse, we all know what<br />\nhappened to him.\"<br />\nMudd said the effect of the<br />\ncont, on p. 6<br /><br />\nA wave of vandalism plaguing<br />\nthe Homewood campus has<br />\ngrown to epidemic proportions<br />\nover the past few weeks, and has<br />\ncaused the closing of at least one<br />\nbuilding to nighttime student<br />\nactivities.<br />\nThe worst destruction occurred on Saturday, March 15,<br />\nwhen Remsen, Shriver, and<br />\nGilman Halls all sustained subdamages.<br />\nstantial<br />\nIn Remsen, where a Weekend<br />\nWonder Flix film was being<br />\nshown in the basement lecture<br />\nhall, vandals apparently broke a<br />\nwater spigot in an unlocked<br />\nCampus<br />\nsecond floor lab.<br />\nSecurity was alerted after the<br />\nleak was discovered by a graduate student working in the<br />\nbuilding.<br />\nSome doubt has been expressed by workers in the<br />\nbuilding concerning Security's<br />\nactions at that point. It reportedly took 20 minutes for<br />\nofficers to respond to the call,<br />\nand another four hours before<br />\nthe leak was sealed off.<br />\nIn any case, five rooms were<br />\ndamaged on three floors, as the<br />\nwater dripped down to the<br />\nbasement. Major repairs were<br />\nnecessary in three of those<br />\nrooms, with ceilings, walls and<br />\ncarpeting all needing to be<br />\nreplaced. Certain fils and other<br />\noffice equipment were also lost.<br />\nThe estimated damage to Remsen Hall alone on that night is<br />\n$5000.<br />\nRemsen has not been the<br />\nonly building to be vandalized.<br />\nThat same night, all the restroom areas in the basement of<br />\nShriver were damaged. Lavatories, toilet seats and dividers were<br />\nall pulled out, said Security<br />\nDaytime Supervisor Mel Widom-<br /><br />\nski. The repair bill here was<br />\nestimated at $500. Again, vandals gained access to the building<br />\nbecause a film was being shown<br />\nin Shriver Auditorium by the<br />\nOffice of Special Events.<br />\nOn that same night, the<br />\nreceiver was pulled out of a<br />\nrecently-installed pay phone<br />\noutside Levering Hall. The inside<br />\nof the building sustained some<br />\ndamages also. The Student Union is regularly hit by vandals--usually drunken Rathskel-.<br />\nlar patrons. Recent destruction<br />\nhas included damage to bathroom fixtures in the first floor<br />\nmen's room (March 16), paint<br />\nsplashed on the wall of the film<br />\nworkshop near the Rat (March<br />\n22), a window th the game room<br />\nbroken (March 24), and the<br />\ndouble door to the film workshop broken (March 29). The<br />\npay phone and a bulletin boar,d<br />\nnear it are destroyed \"every<br />\nweekend,\" stated Widomski.<br />\nAlso on March 15, a sledgehammer was used to smash in<br />\nthe Easy Bank in Gilman Hall.<br />\nAll of this destruction has<br />\ncaused a side effect which is seen<br /><br />\nto be felt by the student body.<br />\nUse of Remsen's lecture hall as a<br />\nfilm theater, or for that matter<br />\nany after hours non-academic<br />\nactivity in the building, has been<br />\nbanned. Some 19 activities,<br />\nincluding lectures and films<br />\nshown by both WWF and the<br />\nReel World, have been either<br />\ncancelled or moved to a different location as a result of the<br />\nban.<br />\nA double screening, \"Up in<br />\nSmoke\" and \"Reefer Madness\",<br />\nis scheduled for April 11 and 12<br />\nin Remsen.

There are 90 days in<br />\nwhich to consider over 3000<br />\nbills. They have to rely on what<br />\nother people tell them in order<br />\nto decide how to vote.<br />\nThe most important source<br />\nof information for legislators,<br />\nand the single thing that can<br />\nensure that a bill will be killed is<br />\nits \"Fiscal Note\". This is a<br />\nposition paper prepared by fiscal<br />\nanalysts, one for each committee<br />\nof the legislature, which tries to<br />\ndetermine how much the bill<br />\nwill cost the state in each of the<br />\nnext three years. The notes are<br />\nthe same size as the bills and are<br />\nthe same binders. VVIIGH<br />\nV<br />\ntelblett<br /><br />\nthe Delegate turns to the bill in<br />\nhis book he sees what the<br />\nanalyst thinks it will cost.<br />\nWhether the note says the<br />\nbill will cost a great deal or only<br />\na little or nothing goes a long<br />\nway to determining whether it<br />\nwill pass. Also, it is possible for<br />\nan analyst to change the<br />\namounts in the note by changing<br />\nthe assumptions he uses in<br />\nwriting it. If he does not like the<br />\nbill he can use worst-case<br />\nassumptions and give it a very<br />\nhigh cost, or if he likes it he can<br />\nshave the cost as much as<br />\npossible.<br />\nThe next most important<br />\nthings to delegates deciding how<br />\nto vote are the positions the<br />\nvarious departments of the government take on measures that<br />\naffect their areas.<br />\nIf the<br />\nDepartment of Transportation<br />\nopposes a bill about state<br />\nhighways it will be almost<br />\nimpossible to pass. Once again<br />\nthese positions are printed the<br />\nin n<br /><br />\nR<br /><br />\nlevel resent having to make up for, or<br />\nadjust to, the defects of a secondary<br />\nschool system which is increasingly<br />\ngeared towards the turning out of<br />\npre-bureaucrats. Nevertheless, until the<br />\nmovement, which<br />\n\"back-to-basics\"<br />\nseems to be making modest headway in<br />\nsome American high schools, becomes<br />\nmore effective, the universities will have<br />\nto bridge the gaps. The Core Curriculums. which have recently appeared<br />\nat Hopkins stem from a recognition of<br />\nthe problem and represent a step in the<br />\nright direction. More of this same type<br />\nof thinking is needed if mediocrity is not<br />\nto characterize the humanists of the 21st<br />\nCentury.<br />\nFor the moment, appropriate<br />\ncourses from the Classics department, as<br />\nwell as a course in the Bible-as-literature,<br />\nshould be incorporated into the mandatory curriculum of most liberal arts<br />\nFor the future, such<br />\ndepartments.<br />\nbasic<br />\nof<br />\nre-thinking<br />\nrequirements should<br />\ncharacterize all departments of the<br />\nUniversity.<br /><br />\nLetters To The Editor<br />\nOpen It Up<br /><br />\nPhoto Staff<br />\nPeter Choo<br />\nStephanie Kretchmer<br />\nAnne McElwee<br /><br />\nWhen the students in the English,<br />\nHistory, Writing Seminars, and Humanities departments are added together,the<br />\nresult is a fairly large number of people<br />\nwho are involved, directly or indirectly,<br />\nin the study of literature. All four of the<br />\nabove departments are renowned for<br />\ntheir excellence, but there is a pervasive<br />\nproblem which prevents many students<br />\nfrom mining them for all they are worth.<br />\nToday, liberal education is making<br />\nassumptions about students which are<br />\nno longer valid. Unlike his counterpart<br />\nof a half-century ago, the average incoming freshman of today enters college<br />\nwithout a basic knowledge of either<br />\nclassical mythology or the Bible. As a<br />\nresult, more than a few professors<br />\ndespair over having to painstakingly<br />\nexplicate the wealth of mythological and<br />\nBiblical allusions which are pervasive in<br />\nall phases of world literature and art. At<br />\nthe same time, the student's grasp of the<br />\nintegrity and permanence of our cultural<br />\ninheritance is seriously weakened.<br />\nMany educators at the college<br /><br />\nI agree completely with<br />\nBruce Smith's letter in the<br />\nlast News-Letter questioning<br />\nclosed meetings. As a Freshman<br />\nRepresentative to the Student<br />\nCouncil I have opposed closed<br />\nmeeting and have voted against<br />\nthem. I also oppose the proposed change in the Constitution<br />\nmaking it easier for the S.C. to<br />\nclose meetings.<br />\nI think the Student Council<br />\nshould do everything it can to<br />\ninform their peers about all<br />\nissues which concern them. If a<br />\nS.C. member isn't doing his or<br />\nher job, the people who elected<br />\nus should have the right to<br />\nknow. If someone's character is<br />\nbeing questioned, the students<br />\nthemselves, rather than Council<br />\nmembers, should be the judge.<br />\nWe should make every<br />\neffort to find out student views.<br />\nBefore Spring Break I took an<br />\ninformal poll in the dorm<br />\ncafeteria to find out what<br />\nstudents think about closed<br />\nmeetings. I polled 124 people at<br />\nThe results were:<br />\nrandom.<br />\n100 were against closed<br />\nmeetings<br />\n12 said there may be a need<br />\nfor them when the situation<br />\nwarrants<br />\n12 were either undecided or<br />\nhad no opinion. Of the twelve<br />\npeople who saw a need for<br />\nclosed meetings four said a<br />\nunanimous vote should be<br />\nrequired to close a meeting.<br />\nTwo people said 6/7, four said<br />\n3/4, and two said 2/3.<br />\nAdmittedly, this poll sample<br />\nis small but it does give a good<br />\nindication of student opinion.<br />\nikAnv neonle ask why the<br /><br />\nStudent Council is spending so<br />\nmuch time arguing about a<br />\nminor issue like closed meetings<br />\nwhen there is so much important<br />\nwork we could be doing. I agree<br />\nthat the issue by itself is minor,<br />\nbut closed meetings undermine<br />\nthe legitimacy of the Student<br />\nCouncil. To lobby for any<br />\nimportant change in this University we need strong student<br />\nsupport. In order to rally strong<br />\nstudent support behind us we<br />\nmust gain student trust and<br />\nTo make the<br />\nconfidence.<br />\nCouncil a truly representative<br />\nbody we have to become more<br />\naccessible to everyone. That<br />\nalso means we can't hide from<br />\nthe News-Letter ,What is there to<br />\nfear if the students know we are<br />\ndoing our job?<br />\nThe Student Council has a<br />\nright to exist only as long as it<br />\nrepresents the students.

Thanks Amy.<br /><br />\nAs far as student activities<br />\ngo - they may soon, in fact, be<br />\ngone.

The sponsoring<br />\ncommittee was formed by Dr..<br />\nNorman Forer, a professor of<br />\nscience.<br />\nat<br />\nthe<br />\npolitical<br />\nUniversity of Kansas. \"The purpose of the trip,\" said Diehl,<br />\n\"was to get people outside the<br />\ngovernment involved in understanding the basis of the Iranian<br />\ncrises.\"<br />\nHe then went on to describe<br />\nhow he and approximately fifty<br />\nother American citizens were<br />\nselected to travel to Iran last<br />\nFebruary and allowed to go<br />\nanywhere they wished. Diehl<br />\nsaid that contrary to the<br />\nimpression one may get from the<br />\ntelevision news, things are very<br />\norderly in Iran. \"Things proceeded normally as in any large<br />\ncity.\" He also stated that the<br />\nIranian people were very friendly towards him and his companions.<br />\n\"Iranians believe that most<br />\nAmericans were not informed<br />\nabout the goings on in Iran until<br />\nrecently,\" said Diehl, adding<br />\n\"Taking hostages woke people<br />\nup to what was happening. The<br />\nstudents brought attention to<br />\ntheir country, but aren't getting<br />\ntheir message across.\"<br />\nAlthough Diehl himself did<br />\nnot meet with any of the hostages, eleven of them visiting<br />\nAmericans were allowed to meet<br />\nwith two of them and related<br />\nOne<br />\ntheir stories to the rest.<br />\nhostage said that he was shocked<br />\nthat the American government<br />\nhadn't returned the Shah after<br />\nthe embassy was taken over.<br />\nAnother said that he felt that<br />\nthe \"students' demands were<br />\ntoo idealistic.\"<br />\nFollowing his lecture, Diehl<br />\nanswered questions from the<br />\naudience. Although there were<br />\nonly sixteen people present,<br /><br />\nthere was active audience participation. This was typified by<br />\ntwo Iranian students who were<br />\ngiving their opinions and describing what it was like living in<br />\nIran. The discussion was dominated by these two for some time<br />\nwhile each recounted his tale.<br />\nOne told of how some friends<br />\nwho had been reading the<br />\n\"wrong\" type of book had been<br />\nreported and subsequently taken<br />\nfrom their homes at gunpoint by<br />\nSAVAK, the Iranian secret police, and dropped from a plane<br />\ninto some lake and never heard<br />\nfrom again. He considers the<br />\nAyatollah Khomeini a \"a very,<br />\nvery great man,\" and believes<br />\nthat after Khomeini dies, there<br />\nwill be another complete revolution. He said that the Islamic<br />\ngovernment would, in his opinion, last only about one or-two<br />\nmore years.<br />\nAs the discussion continued,<br />\nmembers of the audience<br />\nappeared quite opinionated and<br />\nknowledgeable<br />\nin<br />\nmatters<br />\nconcerning the hostage situation<br />\nand in allowing the Shah to<br />\ncome to America. It was pointed out that the United States<br />\ndoes not pay blackmail for its<br />\nambassadors and that while the<br />\nembassy was being overrun, the<br />\nMarine<br />\nguards<br />\ntold<br />\nthe<br />\nAmericans in the building not to<br />\nshow any signs of aggression and<br />\nthat help would soon be on the<br />\nway. There was made mention<br />\nof the fact that U.S. Marines<br />\nguarding embassies are supposed<br />\nto detain the onrushing crowds<br />\nby tear gas and other non-lethal<br />\nmeans long enough for secret<br />\ndocuments to be destroyed.<br />\nAfter the lecture was over, a<br />\nfew of the more interested<br />\nparticipants talked with Diehl<br />\nand tried to find out if he<br />\nthought the initial tying up of<br />\nthe hostages was justified. He<br />\nsaid that although he couldn't<br />\nfind justification in this act, he<br />\ndid find it understandable.<br />\nSome members of the<br />\naudience felt that Diehl was<br />\nrather \"one-sided\" in<br />\nhis<br /><br />\nD.C.

To begin with, I<br />\nam not \"anyone who dislikes<br />\nanimals.\" Quite the contrary, I<br />\nam a concerned human being, a<br />\nstudent at Goucher College and,<br />\ncurrently, an intern with the<br />\nMaryland SPCA (society for the<br />\nprevention of Cruelty to Animals)in Baltimore.<br />\nPersonally, I own six dogs<br />\nand, yet, I must still agree with<br />\nthe \"someone(who)complained<br />\nabout the dogs on campus.\" As<br />\na dog lover, I am forever concerned with the humane treatment of animals, in this case,<br />\ndogs. By humane treatment, I<br />\nmean the love and responsibility<br />\nthat man owes his dog.<br />\nStudents are not being responsible dog owners when they<br />\nallow their dogs to run loose on<br />\nthe Johns Hopkins University<br />\nCampus. An unleashed dog can<br />\nbe hit by a car, can become lost,<br />\ncan be stolen, can be attacked<br />\nby ill-meaning children or other<br />\ndogs, can deface public and<br />\nprivate property, defile the sidewalks and, without meaning to,<br />\ncan scare people who are afraid<br />\nof dogs. (This segment of the<br />\npopulation is greater than one<br />\nmight think.)<br />\nthe dogConsequently,<br />\ncatchers are really doing a<br />\nservice for all members of<br />\nsociety: the students, the dogs<br />\nand all others. By corralling the<br /><br />\n()<br />\n()<br />\n()<br />\n0<br />\n()<br /><br />\ndogs that run loose on the<br />\ncampus, the dogcatchers and the<br />\npeople who complain are, in<br />\nreality, the humane individuals.<br />\nBecause of their efforts, less pets<br />\nturn up in the gutter along<br />\nCharles Street.<br />\nI love dogs and I love to see<br />\nthem where they belong \u2014<br />\nalongside their owners. But,<br />\nplease, license these dogs, secure<br />\nthem with collars and leashes<br />\nand keep everyone on campus<br />\nhappy.<br />\nA concerned humane being,<br />\nKatherine Garland<br />\nGoucher College<br /><br />\nPark Threat<br />\nTo the Editor:<br />\nWords cannot adequately<br />\nexpress my anger and disappointment at the University for<br />\nplanning to mutilate Wyman<br />\nPark with further construction.<br />\nThese buildings will totally destroy its integrity as a park. I<br />\ncannot ignore the fact that there<br />\nare viable alternate sites which<br />\nwould neither necessitate destruction of present structures or<br />\ninterfere with other campus<br />\nfunctions. For example, there is<br />\nthe \"playing field\" in front<br />\nof Garland Hall, the wooded<br />\nareas near the Barn or the<br />\nNews-Letter office. The former<br />\nis seldom used and there are four<br />\nother playing fields, plus the<br />\nample area in front of the<br />\ndormitories, for athletic activities, excluding the Garland Hall<br />\narea.

His brothers<br />\nvoted for Robert Kennedy.<br />\nBuskirk himself worked for<br /><br />\nbecause of his anti-nuclear positions. The only other candidate<br />\nwho was thought to have a<br />\nchance at reawakening the student vote was Kennedy.<br />\nYet in the first presidential<br />\ntest-in Iowa in January--students<br /><br />\nTHANK<br />\nYOU.<br /><br />\nGeorge McGovern in 1972 and<br />\nMorris Udall in 1976.

The ten-term Illinois<br />\ncongressman did not campaign<br />\nin the South, but managed to<br />\nattract student support anyway.<br />\nBy the time the presidential<br />\ncontest rolled into Illinois, the<br />\ncontest for student support was<br />\nnarrowed down to Kennedy and<br />\nIllinois, however,<br />\nAnderson.<br />\nillustrated the Massachusetts senator's inability to draw support<br />\nfrom what should be his natural<br />\nconstituency.<br />\nIn the days before the vote,<br />\nKennedy's campaigns at Chicago<br />\narea campuses were almost defunct. The explanations ranged<br />\nfrom a dislike of Kennedy's<br />\npersonality--\"He's ambitious just<br />\nlike the way Caesar called Brutus<br />\nambitious,\" Northwestern senior<br />\nJohn McGlocklin says\u2014to a certain student conservatism.<br />\n\"Students are conservative<br />\non economic issues,\" says Eileen<br />\nKelly, editor of Loyola University's student paper. \"Their<br />\nparents are very business-oriented, and Kennedy's economic<br />\npolicy would be catastrophic for<br />\nthem.

Perhaps the mostfamous example is<br />\nEdgar Allan Poe, who reputedly passed away in a Baltimore gutter after downing one bourbon too many at a<br />\nparty. The other and less obvious of the two is F. Scott<br />\nFitzgerald. Off and on during the late 1920's and early<br />\n'30's, Scott and Zelda plus daughter E-gnces resided in<br />\nan apartment house that stood directly epporsite the<br />\nJohns Hopkins University. Now known as Wolman Hall,<br />\nthe building served as Fitzgerald's base while his wife<br />\nunderwent care at Baltimore's Shepherd Pratt Hospital.<br />\nFitzgerald died in Hollywood in 1940, did some writing<br />\n(and no doubt some drinking) at the apartment. The<br />\nmost notable of his Baltimore books, Afternoon of an<br />\nAuthor, speaks fondly of the city and its people.<br />\nI recently conducted this hasty bit of third-rate<br />\ndetective work after being told a rather interesting story<br />\nby one Ben Button, an acquaintance of mine and a<br />\nthird-year Humanities major who lives on the 4th floor<br />\nof Wolman. I asked him if he would care to jot down his<br />\ntale for the News-Letter's faithful readership; but, like<br />\nmost conscientious Hoppies, Ben avows that his studies<br />\ncome before anything as frivolous as the school newspaper. Perforce, I had to wheel and deal with him: if he'd<br />\ndictate his story to me, I'd buy him a few brews at the<br />\nRat some weekend in the near future. The price of<br />\nbeing an enterprising young reporter.<br />\nAnyway, to shorten an already too-long story, he<br />\naccepted. And so, without further to-do, the curious<br />\ncase of Ben Button, as told to yours truly, follows.<br />\nP.E.<br />\non a<br />\na.m.<br />\n2<br />\nwas<br />\nIt was Friday night. Actually,it<br />\nhome<br />\ngone<br />\nhad<br />\nroommate<br />\nSaturday morning. My<br />\nto Pennsylvania for the weekend, and I was just settling<br />\ninto bed after having spent several debauched hours as a<br />\nTEP soiree. I couldn't have been lying down for more<br />\nthan ten minutes when I heard a noise coming from<br />\noutside my bedroom door. The noise was rather faint at<br />\nfirst, but it steadily grew louder and clearer. It sounded<br />\nlike uneven, stumbling footsteps. Then I heard a voice<br />\nsinging a song about Valencia. It was unmistakably the<br />\nvoice of someone with more than a few drinks in him.<br />\nI began feeling somewhat afraid. I sat up in bed<br />\nand tentatively called out, \"Wh-wh-who's there?\"<br />\nSuddenly-I'm not even certain how to describe itsuddenly, a white blur came through my bedroom door.<br />\nThat is, the door was closed, bolted shut in fact, and this<br />\nblur (what appeared to be a human figure) came right<br />\nthrough the door. I blinked at it and stammered what<br />\nthe hell's going on\" two or three times.<br />\nThe figure began to assume a more distinct<br />\nshape. I couldn't believe what I was seeing, but there it<br />\nstood-the ghostly apparition of a man! An impeccably<br />\ndressed man at that: He sported an ascot, a handsome<br />\njacket, and knickers. I had never seen anyone wearing<br />\nknickers before. He also had a bottle in his hand.<br />\nHe stood there in the middle of my room,<br />\nswaying, looking around. I cowered in my bed and<br />\nblurted out,\"who are you?\"<br />\nHe wheeled about and faced me. \"Oh,hello, old<br />\nsport,\" he said, as if he hadn't noticed me until that<br />\nmoment. He was very charming, and most definitely<br />\nsloshed out of his skull. \"I see you've kept this place up<br />\nnice.\" He took a hit off his bottle.<br />\n\"Who are you? What are you doing in my<br />\nroom?\"<br />\n\"Who am I? Who am I?\" He seemed indignant.<br />\n\"You don't know who I am? Don't you recognize me?<br />\nHmmm? Go on, take a guess.\"<br />\nI was confused. On top of that, my head was not<br />\nin what might be called Grade A shape. I rubbed my<br />\neyes furiously.<br />\n\"Give up? Then I shall tell you.,\" he said. He<br />\nrested his bottle on the floor, folded his arms, and<br />\ncocked his head. He was still swaying. \"I...I am the<br />\nrenowned writer of short stories, novels, screenplays...<br />\nscribe of the Jazz Age... ex-patriot former drop-out of<br />\nPrinceton University, formerly of the United States<br />\nArmy...! am F. Scott-\" he belched \"Fitzgerald.\"<br />\nMy consternation was turning into anger. Moreover, I was tired, groggy,and still unsure just what I was<br />\ndealing with. Was it something I ate, drank, dreamed?<br /><br />\nSitting down at the desk, I fed a piece of paper<br />\ninto the typewriter and turned the machine on. Maybe<br />\nhumoring this guy was the best way to be rid of him.<br />\n\"Okay, what do you want to dictate?\"<br />\nHe began pacing. \"I intend to complete my great<br />\nunfinished novel, The Last Typhoon.\"<br />\n\"You mean The Last Tycoon, don't you?\"<br />\n\u2022<br />\n\"Precisely. Now then, let's see. Where did I<br />\nleave off? The last paragraph of the book, I believe, was,<br />\nuh...ah, yet: `Gatsby believed in the green light, the<br />\norgiastic future that year by year recedes before us.\"<br />\n\"Uh oh,\" I said, typing.<br />\n\"It eluded us then,\" he continued,\"but that'.s<br />\nno matter--tomorrow we will run faster, stretch our arms<br />\nfarther...And one fine morning-New paragraph, old<br />\nsport. So we beat on, boats against the current, borne<br />\nback ceaselessly into the past.\"<br />\nPausing, he took a long swig from his bottle.<br />\n\"Not bad, eh, old sport? Pity I had to pass on and leave<br />\nsuch magnificent stuff unended. Until now, that is.\"<br />\nHe started pacing again. \"Uh...Ceaselessly into the past.'<br />\nThat's where the book left off, correct? Alright,<br />\nuh...add this on old sport, and make sure you get the<br />\ndots and hyphens right: The past, hyphen,the faster we<br />\nrun towards it, dot, dot, dot, the farther our arms<br />\nstretch for it, dot, dot, hyphen, the farther it becomes.<br />\nIt eludes us still. The past remains the past.\"<br />\nAll of a sudden he stopped and grew rather<br />\npensive. He walked to the window. A few car horns<br />\nhonked in the distance.<br />\n\"Ah, Charles Street looks lovely tonight,\" he<br />\nsaid. It was almost a whisper. \"I remember once when<br />\nmy dear Hilda and I went to a splendid party in New<br />\nYork and we rode on the roof of the cab.\"<br />\n\"Wasn't your wife's name Zelda?\"<br />\n\"Of course it was. When we got to the hotel<br />\nwhere the party was being given, Hilda and I jumped<br />\ninto a huge fountain and started swimming. Before long,<br />\neveryone had jumped in.\" He chuckled softly to himself. In a way, I felt sorry for him, whoever he was.<br />\nCome to think of it, I thought to myself, who is he,<br />\nanyway? \"Those were the days, old sport. The only<br />\ntime to be alive...\"<br />\nAbout-facing abruptly, he staggered back to the<br />\nmiddle of the room. \"Well, so much for reminiscing.<br />\nIt's back to work. Right now my main concern is<br />\nfinishing The Last Tie-Pin.\"<br />\n\"Excuse me, Mister, uh...Fitzgerald.\"<br />\n\"Please, call me Scott.\"<br />\n\"....I'm sorry I yelled at you earlier.\"<br />\n\"No need to apologize, old sport. You had the<br />\nright. I suppose I was--am--indeed trespassing. It's just<br />\nthat occasionally I like to revisit some of my old stomping grounds, my old haunts...\"<br />\n\"Well, no hard feelings, huh? There is just one<br />\nthing, though, that I wanted to ask.\" For some reason I<br />\nwas having a hard time asking it. \"You remember<br />\nthe very first part you dictated? The green light and the<br />\nboats against the current? Isn't that the ending of The<br />\nGreat Gatsby?\"<br />\nHe lowered his head and clutched his bottle to<br />\nhis chest. \"Didn't fool you, eh, old sport,\" he said<br />\nquietly. \"I know, I know. I don't have it anymore.<br />\nWhen you haven't written in 40 years, you get a trifle<br />\nrusty. She warned me this would happen. She told me<br />\nI'd end up like this-a pie-eyed ex-writer, boring everyoneimposing myself upon people...\"<br />\n\"Who said that?\"<br />\n\"Hilda.\"<br />\n\"You mean Zelda.\"<br />\nI jumped out of my bed and stalked over to him.<br />\nI<br />\nbuddy.<br />\nI mean Hilda, my manicurist,\" he said.<br />\nlook,<br />\n\"No,<br />\nI was really getting steamed. \"Now<br />\nBut<br />\nare.<br />\nyou<br />\ndid I ever tell you about the party in<br />\nwho<br />\nsport,<br />\nold<br />\ncare<br />\ndon't<br />\n\"Say,<br />\nI<br />\ndon't know who you are.<br />\njumped into the...\" His voice trailed<br />\ndon't\"<br />\nwe<br />\nyou<br />\nif<br />\nwhen<br />\ncops<br />\nYork<br />\nthe<br />\nNew<br />\ncall<br />\nI'm<br />\nnow,<br />\ngonna<br />\nsecond<br />\nany<br />\n\"Do me a favor, old sport.\" He stood up and off. \"I'm sorry.\"<br />\nHe seemed a bit more clear-headed than when he<br />\nheld the chair out for me.\"Do the literary world a favor.<br />\nhad entered the apartment. Still clutching the bottle, he<br />\nDo mankind a favor!\"<br />\nmoved slowly towards the door. \"Old sport,\" he said,\"I<br />\n\"Huh?\"<br />\nto thank you for your hospitality.

Just as long as you promise door, the footsteps became fainter and fainter, and a sad<br />\nvoice kept calling, \"Hilda, Hilda...\"<br />\nto leave.\"<br /><br />\nWas it a hallucination, a bum off the street, a friend<br />\nplaying a practical joke? It had to be one of those<br />\nthings. And if it was none of those things, then naturally, I told myself, it had to be the ghost of F. Scott<br />\nFitzgerald. Of course. What else?<br />\nWhatever it was, I wanted it out of my apartment. \"Look,\" I snapped, \"if you don't vacate my<br />\nroom in ten seconds, I'm calling Security.\"<br />\n\"Please, old sport,\" my visitor said, shooshing<br />\nme as he picked up his bottle. \"Let's not have a rhubarb.\" He turned around. Apparently he was looking<br />\nfor something. \"Where in blazes do you keep your...<br />\nuh...?\" He made motions with his fingers as if he were<br />\ntyping in the air.<br />\n\"Typewriter?\"<br />\n\"Exactly. Where do you keep yours, old sport?\"<br />\nHe careened to the left and saw my electric Smith-Corona sitting on my desk. \"Aha!

Nothing happened; he<br />\nhadn't turned the machine on.<br />\n\"Good God,old sport,\" he bellowed,\"you really<br />\nshould get your Remington fixed.

It was swift,<br />\nif not altogether sure.<br />\nJournalists feared the religionists aimed to turn<br />\nthe student-run Iowa State Daily, which the \"pub<br />\nboard\" controls, into a self-consciously Christian<br />\nmedium.<br />\nFaculty members of the board, worried<br />\nabout the ease with which a special interest group got<br />\ninto the position of control of the paper, announced<br />\na boycott of board meetings. The county government<br />\nsued on the Daily's behalf. And members of the KSU<br />\nBible Study Group, while protesting their innocence,<br />\nworried that the newspaper, in trying to stop special<br />\ninterest groups from doing the same thing in the future,<br />\nmay be discriminating agianst students on the basis<br />\nof their religion.<br />\nThough the Iowa State case is especially<br />\ndramatic, such controversies arise every spring, and<br />\nusually on more than one campus at a time. The<br />\nseasonal crop of April Fool's Day and humor issues<br />\nusually include material that one campus group or<br />\nanother finds offensive. The offended group, in turn,<br />\nwill raise the most difficult question in college<br />\njournalism: who should control the content of the<br />\nstudent newspaper?<br />\nAt Iowa State, of course, the controversy did not<br />\narise out of any expressions of newroom humor. But<br />\nmost of the precedents that could determine the<br />\noutcome of what Daily staffers call a conspiracy arose<br />\nout of controversies over \"joke journalism,\" according<br />\nto Mike Simpson of the Student Press Law Center in<br />\nWashington, D.C.<br />\nThe range of response was evident last spring. In<br />\nApril, for example, The Davidsonian, the student paper<br />\nat Davidson in North Carolina, published a satirical<br />\n\"Guide to Courses\"that was roundly criticized as<br />\ntasteless, especially by alumni and administrators.<br />\nBut the price of offending student newspaper<br />\nreaders is often higher. What Simpson describes as \"a<br />\nvery conservative group\" is sponsoring a referendum to<br />\ncut off student funding for the Daily Tarheal at the<br />\nUniversity of North Carolina-Chapel Hill.<br />\nNothing seems to cause controversy more readily<br /><br />\nthan humorous religious references in a student paper,<br />\nhowever. A University of Minnesota Daily mock<br />\ninterview with Jesus Christ was blasted as<br />\n\"anti-religious\" and \"racist\", and lead to yet another<br />\nfund cutoff referendum. It was recently defeated by a<br />\ntwo-to-one margin.<br />\nBut it was too much for critics to take last spring<br />\nwhen the Observation Post at the City University of New<br />\nYork published a picture of a woman in a scanty nun's<br />\nhabit masturbating with a crucifix. Students voted to<br />\ncut off the paper's funding in retaliation. The picture<br />\nalso brought on a bill in the New York legislature that<br />\nwould have cut off funding for student papers at all<br />\nstate schools. The bill actually passed the Senate, but<br />\nfailed in the House.<br />\nNo one has accused the Iowa State Daily of<br />\nobscenity, but critics have occasionally protested that<br />\nthe paper has failed to take a \"moral\" view of what to<br />\ninclude in the paper.<br />\nDaily Editor Vicki Shannon recalls getting<br />\nspecific criticism of an account of a campus rape, a story<br />\nabout life in Nigeria, and satires about fraternity and<br />\nsorority \"dirty rushing.\"<br />\nShannon had heard of the group before. She<br />\ndates the tensions between the paper and the religionists<br />\nto the group's attempt several years ago to get funding<br />\nfor a Bible Study Group-produced newspaper. The<br />\npaper, though not a daily, would have competed with<br />\nthe Iowa State Daily for funds and student attention.<br />\nSome students - Shannon claims they were<br />\nmostly Bible Study Group members -- then sponsored an<br />\ninitiative that would have cut the Day off form student<br />\nfees. It failed by a three-to-one margin.<br />\nIn the meantime, however, Bible Study Group<br />\nmembers were quietly joining the low-profile<br />\nPublications Board. The board, according to Rose Marie<br />\nKing of the Daily.\"has only two jobs: make sure all the<br />\nnumbers are right, and appoint the editor.\"<br />\nShannon's primary concern is they'll appoint a<br />\nsuccessor who will \"turn the Daily into a religious<br />\npaper.\"<br />\nBible Study Group president Jeff Newburg, who<br />\nclaims a membership of 500, scoffs at fears the group is<br />\ntrying to \"take over the Daily.\"<br />\n\"What people do on their own time is their own<br /><br />\nSENIOR CLASS FILM SERIES PRESENTS. . .<br />\n'Best<br />\nPicture<br />\nGrand Prix<br />\nDu Cinema<br />\nFrancais<br /><br />\nbusiness,\" he says. I'm just glad to see students get<br />\ninvolved in these times of so much student apathy.<br />\n\"Some members of the group heard about the vacancies,<br />\nand told their friends, 'Wouldn't it be nice if we all tried<br />\nout for it?'\"<br />\nDaily business manager Spicer doesn't think it<br />\nwas that innocent. \"I've never seen such an all-out<br />\neffort. They've been at it for a year.\"<br />\nThey have been unable to elect their own editor,<br />\nhowever. Pub Board bylaws require that at least two of<br />\nthe faculty members be present at the meetings in order<br />\nto take votes. Faculty members have refused to attend<br />\nmeetings until the status of the six<br />\nBible Study<br />\nGroup members is settled.<br />\nDaily staffers hope to dislodge the members, all<br />\nof whom they found, have graduated. Graduates cannot<br />\nsit on the board, but the six fundamentalists have<br />\nre-enrolled and are taking classes. They maintain their<br />\nclasses mean they have not severed their relations<br />\nwith the university, and that they therefore can legally<br />\nsit on the board.<br />\nThe newspaper, which cannot sue its own ruling<br />\nboard, convinced the county attorney to press charges<br />\nagainst the fundamentalist board members on the<br />\ngrounds that, as graduates, they wrongly hold their board<br />\nseats. A decision is pending.<br />\nPreventing a special interest group from<br />\ndominating the board in the future is an even stickier<br />\nissue. Most Daily staffers seem to favor making it harder<br />\nfor people to get on the pub board.<br />\n\"Right now,\" Shannon say, \"applicants don't<br />\nhave to have any qualifications. The current members<br />\njust ask the applicants a few questions.\" She thinks a<br />\nmore thorough screening, perhaps including an<br />\nexamination of extracurricular activities, should be<br />\nmade.<br />\nShe also believes a better definition of the pub<br />\nboard's duties is necessary. Although the board has never<br />\nofficially \"meddled\" in editorial content, the current<br />\ncontroversy domonstrates the potential is there.<br />\nShannon, who must stay on as editor until the<br />\npub board elects a successor, is pessimistic about a quick<br />\nresolution. \"I guess the ultimate answer would be an<br />\nindependent Daily, but I don't see that for another ten<br />\nyears...\" .<br /><br />\nFRIDAY<br /><br />\nSATURDAY<br /><br />\nAPRIL4' S5<br />\nNEXT WEEK:<br />\nDr. Strangelove &amp; KING OF HEARTS<br />\nFull of fondness, rue, outrage and high<br />\nspirits.

Under a new<br />\ncoach, Robert Babb, the Jays are<br />\nshowing steady improvement in<br />\nthe field and some superb<br />\npitching. Hopes of a division<br />\nchampionship hinge on upcoming games, but the Jays record so<br />\nfar (4-2-1) is indicative of a<br />\nstrong start.<br />\nThe Jays began their season<br />\nwith a bang by defeating Wilkes<br />\nCollege 54 in a dramatic ninth<br />\ninning comeback. The score<br />\nstood 4-1 Wilkes in the top of<br />\nthe ninth inning, with Hopkins's<br />\nonly run scored when Mike April<br />\ndoubled home Brad Rosborough.<br /><br />\n\"Our defense<br />\nhas been<br />\nvery porous...\"<br />\nCoach Babb<br />\nIn the bottom of the ninth, Bill<br />\nStromberg doubled with one on<br />\nand one out and Mark Burrows<br />\nfollowed with an RBI single.<br />\nWith the score 4-2, a fielder's<br />\nchoice left runners on first and<br />\nthird with two outs.
