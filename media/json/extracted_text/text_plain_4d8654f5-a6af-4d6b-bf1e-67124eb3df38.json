As a packaging material it had<br />\neye appeal. Its uses were limited,<br />\nhowever. Perishable foods wrapped<br />\nin this cellulose film were protected<br />\nfrom contamination and were good<br />\nto look at, but they did not retain<br />\ntheir freshness. They either lost or<br />\nabsorbed moisture,depending on the<br />\nnature of the food and atmospheric<br />\nconditions.<br />\nThat was a challenge to Du Pont<br />\nresearch people.
