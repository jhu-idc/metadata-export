Calvin<br />\nMackenzie, associate professor<br />\nof government at Colby. \"But<br />\nthe umbrella of the fraternity<br />\nallows students to do things<br />\nthat their own consciences<br />\nwouldn't otherwise permit.\"<br />\n\"The sororities got the real<br />\nbad end of this,\" says senior<br />\nErick J.

Some visitors and female<br />\nstudents complain that walking<br />\npast the houses is often accompanied by harassment.<br />\nAlthough the houses are<br />\nfraternity-owned, the college<br />\nowns the land beneath them.<br />\nColby is obligated by contract<br />\nto pay the Greeks \"fair value\"<br />\nfor their houses, but the money<br />\nwill return to the college for<br />\nfraternity-named funds to<br />\nbenefit future students or the<br />\ncollege. In addition, the<br />\nchapters owe Colby $400,000<br />\nfor various debts.<br />\nAn overall willingness to disband the Greek organizations<br />\nmay be due in part to the<br />\nspecial commission's recommendation that Colby's<br />\nresidential life be completely<br />\nreorganized.

One<br />\nmanages, of course, during<br />\none's four-year stay at Hopkins<br />\nto accumulate a group of<br />\nfriends and acquaintances\u2014<br />\nindeed it's practically impossible not to in view of the small<br />\nsize of the undergraduate<br />\npopulation. But groups tend to<br />\nbe clicquish, and once established, difficult to break into. By<br />\nand large, good friendships are<br />\nhard to come by, and with few<br />\nexceptions<br />\nduring<br />\nan<br />\nundergraduate's career, friend-<br />\n<br />\nships made at Hopkins are of a<br />\nsuperficial and transient nature.<br />\nThe greatest obstacle to a<br />\nbetter social life at Hopkins is<br />\nhousing, or lack of it. During<br />\nhis first year, the freshman is<br />\nsurrounded by peers, people<br />\nwith whom he shares a great<br />\ndeal. The common bond of fear<br />\nand need for companionship in<br />\na new environment bring<br />\nfreshmen together; parties<br />\nabound, and there is ample opportunity to meet people. This<br />\nis the beginning of enduring<br />\nfriendships\u2014or should be. Unfortunately, after being forced<br />\nto move off-campus the following year and into apartments,<br />\nfriends lose contact with each<br />\nother and become increasingly<br />\n<br />\ninsular as their academic<br />\ndemands gain precedence over<br />\ntheir social life.<br />\nThe Hopkins student tends<br />\ntoward a natural selfcentredness, the result of strong<br />\nambition and determination to<br />\nsucceed, which draws most\u2022<br />\nstudents away from each other<br />\nand outside concerns. This selfcentredness only gets worse,<br />\nand by senior year, when the<br />\npressures of school are compounded by the pressures of<br />\ngetting a job or applying to<br />\ngraduate school, thoughts turn<br />\naway from such mundane matters as the Rat, fraternity parties, or visiting friends.<br />\nThe enforced dissociation of<br />\nstudents as they move from the<br />\n<br />\nAcIO<br />\naoD Ckixy CaRli?<br />\nD<br />\nWHAT SHE MFA S<br />\nWHAT SHE {I<br />\n{21<br />\n<br />\n\"DROVE<br />\nHI I'MDOWNFROMHERETHEWITHMIDWEST'?<br />\nSIXXXX<br />\nGUYS,<br />\nKEEP<br />\nUP WITHBUTME,THEY<br />\nSO ICOULDN'T<br />\nLEFT THEM.<br />\n<br />\nEY\u00b0\u00b0<br />\n<br />\nACTUALLY,<br />\nTHEY<br />\nME<br />\nAS<br />\nFAR<br />\nAS THETOOK<br />\nFLORIDA<br />\nBORDER,<br />\nBUT<br />\nTHEYANYCOULDN'T<br />\nTAKE<br />\nME<br />\nLONGER,<br />\nSO<br />\nTHEY DUMPED ME,'\"<br />\n\"IFOOTBALL<br />\nLIKE BASEBALL<br />\nAND<br />\nPLAYERS<br />\nMORE,<br />\nBUT<br />\nTHEY<br />\nDON'T<br />\nME ANYMORE!\"<br />\n\"IANSIPPED<br />\nA BEER<br />\nHOUR AND<br />\nFELLFORASLEEP<br />\nSTUDYING<br />\nCHEM!\"<br />\n<br />\n\"00000!<br />\nYOU'RE TALL!LOVEDO YOU<br />\nPLAY BASKETBALL?<br />\nBASKETBALL<br />\nCHEERLEADERPLAYERS.<br />\nAT SCHOOL..I'M A<br />\n\"MY<br />\nEYESI WAS<br />\nMUSTPARTYING<br />\nREALLY BE<br />\nRED..<br />\nVERYBAD<br />\nNIGHT.THERE\"<br />\nLATE YOULASTWEREN'T<br />\nTOO<br />\nWWI<br />\n\"WOULD<br />\nLIKE ID SLEEP SLEEP..<br />\nCOURSE, I ONLY MEAN<br />\nWITH MEYOUTONIGHT?!?!\"<br />\nMUCUS \"GOSH,<br />\nI HOPEANDYOUI WOULD...?\"<br />\nDIDN't \"IGETJUST<br />\nWANTED YOU TO<br />\nEXCITED!!!?\"<br />\nI<br />\n<br />\nLIKE<br />\n<br />\n\"Of<br />\n<br />\n.SEPARATELY!\"<br />\n<br />\nThink YOU<br />\n<br />\ndorms into apartments merely<br />\nexacerbates these tendencies. In<br />\nschools equally competitive as<br />\nHopkins, with students just as<br />\nconcerned with their studies<br />\nand their futures, but with<br />\nmore conducive living situations, social life thrives.<br />\nThe administration's lack of<br />\nconcern for undergraduate<br />\nsocial life has contributed to the<br />\nproblem as well. Leaving all the<br />\norganizing of campus events to<br />\nthe students just demonstrates<br />\nmore clearly the student's<br />\npreoccupation with their own<br />\nconcerns, and the problem remains. The New York Times<br />\nrecently cited a nationwide<br />\ntrend among colleges to take an<br />\nactive role in restructuring their<br />\ncampus social life; and<br />\nHopkins, not to be outdone,<br />\nhas begun to make improvements, primarily involving physical changes, like the<br />\nconstruction of new dorms.<br />\nAlthough the dorms are new,<br />\nand that in itself is a relief after<br />\nthe musty old dorms, the oldest<br />\nof which were built in the<br />\n1920's, that is not enough. Like<br />\nthe old dorms, their design<br />\ndoesn't encourage free socializing. There is still a need for<br />\nareas to gather in groups\u2014<br />\noutside the bedroom; and instead of the \"charm\" of the old<br />\ndorms, the new ones have the<br />\nantiseptic atmosphere of a<br />\nsanitarium.<br />\nWho can guess how far the<br />\ntrend will inspire Hopkins to<br />\ngo; but if the Administration<br />\ndoes decide to invest more<br />\nmoney to improve campus<br />\nsocial life, they would be wise<br />\nto heed the advice of those for<br />\n<br />\nwhom the changes are<br />\nintended.<br />\nMost important, there should<br />\nbe enough dorm space available<br />\nfor undergraduates to have the<br />\nchoice of living on campus or<br />\noff. In the case of those who<br />\nchoose to live off-campus, the<br />\nUniversity should take some<br />\nresponsibility for student<br />\naccomodations.<br />\nIn order to attract students to<br />\nthe dorms, there must be plenty of common space for<br />\ngathering\u2014say, for example,<br />\nlounges on every floor.

I asked<br />\nboth the store o\u2018ners and the<br />\npedestrians the same question:<br />\n<br />\nWhat is your overall opinion<br />\nof the Hopkins students with<br />\nwhom you have come in contact, and can you share any personal experiences that you have<br />\nhad in the past to give me further insight into the relationship<br />\nthat has been established between Hopkins and its surrounding community?<br />\nMost people immediately<br />\nestablished the fact that, since<br />\nwe give them the most business,<br />\nthe store owners in the community greatly appreciate<br />\nHopkins students, and have no<br />\nqualms regarding our presence<br />\nhere. Just because we frequently patronize them, however,<br />\n<br />\ndoes not put us at the top of<br />\ntheir favorite people list.<br />\nWhen I stopped at Wawa, a<br />\nLoyola student was working<br />\nbehind<br />\nthe<br />\ncounter<br />\n(workstudy?). When I inquired<br />\nabout Hopkins students, he<br />\nsaid,<br />\n\"Some of you guys come in<br />\n(here falling all over the place,<br />\nmaking a mess at all hours of<br />\nthe night.\" (I couldn't imagine<br />\nwhy we would be so clumsy.)<br />\nHe went on to say that we are<br />\n\"real friendly.\" In regard to<br />\nany outstanding personalities,<br />\nhe told me about this \"cowboy<br />\n,guy who comes in and always<br />\nsays 'Gimme one of them chili<br />\n<br />\ndogs.\" Tex, will you quit<br />\nbothering him? I went to the<br />\nback of the store to speak with<br />\nthe manager who said he had<br />\nnever seen so many junk food<br />\neaters in his life. He said,<br />\n\"There's only been one<br />\nHopkins student I haven't liked in the years I worked here<br />\nand he's not around anymore.\"<br />\nI didn't ask where he went<br />\noff to, because it wasn't significant to this story and by the<br />\nlooks of the manager, I was<br />\nafraid to find out.<br />\nThe lady behind the counter<br />\nat Greenway Pharmacy has<br />\nbeen there for 22 years. She<br />\nremembers how, back in the<br />\n<br />\nsixties, we \"blockaded Charles<br />\nStreet and playqd music and<br />\ncamped out.\" Things have<br />\nchanged. Now we get killed on<br />\nCharles Street, blast music and,<br />\nsleep out. She has developed<br />\nclose relationships with several<br />\nstudents and says that some<br />\ngraduates still write to her and<br />\neven invite her to their homes,<br />\nin places as exotic as Hawaii<br />\nand China. She also added that<br />\nthrough the years, she has seen<br />\nan intelligence increase, but<br />\nnotes a growing \"lack of common sense.\" She never really<br />\nexplained what she meant by<br />\nthis, but I guess she just has<br />\ntrouble understanding why<br />\nstudents are willing to pay $4.50<br />\nfor a tube of Crest.<br />\n\"The courting of a girl isn't<br />\nthe same as it was 15 years<br />\nago,\" remarked the owner of<br />\nBob Gordon's flower shop.(He<br />\ntried to comfort me when I<br />\nshowed my scars of proof.)The<br />\nflower selling business has<br />\nchanged direction here in<br />\nCharles Village. Sales are still<br />\nup, but instead of selling 50<br />\nbouquets a week, he sells 100<br />\nsingle stemmed flowers. \"It<br />\nseems that flowers have become<br />\nmore of a token of friendship<br />\nthan of loving devotion,\" he<br />\nsaid, and we both agreed that<br />\nthis was not only typical of<br />\nBaltimore, but all over the<br />\ncountry.

I should<br />\nhave known better than to ask<br />\nhim what I had asked the<br />\nothers, because my inquiry<br />\nopened a can of worms uglier<br />\nthan both of us. He rattled on<br />\nand on about this party and<br />\nthat party; he certainly let me<br />\nknow how annoyed he and the<br />\nrest of the force were. He told<br />\nme that as intellectuals, the<br />\nHopkins students have a surprising amount of difficulty in<br />\nunderstanding the reality that<br />\nthere are people who sleep and<br />\nwork in this community at normal, eastern standard time<br />\nhours.

However, most of<br />\nour conversation focused on<br />\nthe future\u2014of the relationship.<br />\n\"There's a very thin line,\" he<br />\nsaid, \"between maintaining<br />\nacademic excellence and<br />\nacademic isolation.\" Although<br />\nours is a private institution,<br />\nJack feels that we owe ourselves<br />\nand members of the surrounding community programs that<br />\ncall for more community/campus interaction. \"There's an<br />\nabundance of senior citizens in<br />\nthis community who would enjoy participating in free activities sponsored by the<br />\nUniversity.\" He suggested that<br />\nwe have more student and<br />\nfaculty lectures offered to the<br />\npublic, and added that both<br />\nsides would benefit from this.<br />\nHe said this would not infringe<br />\nUpon Hopkins' high academic<br />\nstandards, but the University<br />\nwould increase the quality of its<br />\nwith<br />\nthe<br />\nrelationship<br />\ncommunity.<br />\nAfter speaking with Jack, I<br />\ncontacted a representative from<br />\nthe Office of Community Affairs(OCA)at Hopkins to learn<br />\nmore about his concern. I<br />\nfound that it is a concern, but<br />\nunfortunately, that's as far as<br />\nit goes. With limited funds and<br />\nParticipants, organizations such<br />\nas OCA have difficulty procuring tangible results from their<br />\nprograms. Their projects focus<br />\non youth, the elderly, integrated/segregated community functions, and economic<br />\nwell-being. These are all crucial<br />\nPoints, and hopefully their problems will be resolved soon, by<br />\nthe community's increased<br />\nawareness of some viable solutions with some help from<br />\nHopkins.<br />\nSo..if Princeton University<br />\nput Princeton, New Jersey on<br />\nthe map, can it be said that the<br />\nJohns Hopkins University put<br />\nBaltimore on the map as well?<br />\nOr is it just Charm City's<br />\nskillful drivers and the Orioles<br />\nwho gave Baltimore national<br />\nrecognition? We might even<br />\nventure to guess the city's proximity to the nation's capitol<br />\ncreated some popularity.<br />\nIn any case, it is the people<br />\nbehind the machines who make<br />\nthem run, and the path they<br />\nchoose to travel is just as<br />\nimportant.<br />\nWhile it is amusing to<br />\nobserve Charles Village, and it<br />\nIS equally amusing to learn<br />\nWhat some of its inhabitants<br />\nthink of Hopkins we must try<br />\nto maintain and improve the<br />\nrelationship.<br />\nSome prefer to follow the<br />\napathetic doctrine of keeping a<br />\ndistance, since, as individuals,<br />\nour stay at Hopkins is limited<br />\nto four years. During these four<br />\nYears we should take advantage<br />\nof everything that Hopkins has<br />\nto offer. Participating in community projects is definitely a<br />\nworthwhile endeavor, but for<br />\nsome it cannot be the major<br />\npart of the college experience.<br />\nHowever, there is something<br />\nto be learned from the community<br />\nthat surrounds<br />\nHopkins. Somehow we must<br />\nattempt to achieve a balance<br />\n<br />\nbetween alienation and participation within the surrounding communities. We should<br />\nstart by trying to treat the<br />\nmembers of the community as<br />\nwe should a sleeping lion: not<br />\ntoo attentive so as to be more<br />\nbothersome than friendly but to<br />\nobserve from a pleasant<br />\ndistance. Also, we should smile<br />\nat the passing stranger. It can't<br />\nhurt, it can only help. Maybe he<br />\nwill respond to your genuine<br />\nwarmth.

With temperatures<br />\nhovering around 32 degrees and<br />\nthe field surrounded by mounds<br />\nof snow, it hardly looked like<br />\na day for lacrosse. Still, a large<br />\ncrowd showed up.<br />\nAs expected, the Jays started<br />\nWood, Odenthal, and Scott on<br />\nattack. At midfield were<br />\nDressel, Krumenacker, and<br />\nChanenchuk, and on defense<br />\nwere Matricciani, Dubin, and<br />\nDeTommasso. Larry Quinn<br />\nwas in goal.<br />\nThe game began as anticipated, with Hopkins<br />\ndominating. Scoring this<br />\nseason's first goal was the Jays'<br />\nleading scorer last year, Del<br />\nDressel, off a rebound shot by<br />\nWilly Odenthal. A few minutes<br />\nlater, Scott had the ball behind<br />\nthe goal with a middie covering<br />\nhim. Hopkins' other attackmen<br />\ncleared the crease to take advantage of the mismatch, and<br />\nScott easily beat his opponent<br />\nand stuffed the ball past the<br />\ngoalie.<br />\nThe Jays continued to control the play in the second<br />\nquarter as freshman Brian<br />\nWood got in close and \"ripped<br />\nthe net,\" putting Hopkins<br />\nahead 3-0. When Brent Ciccarone scored midway through<br />\nthe period, it looked as if<br />\nHopkins was going to run away<br />\nwith the game.<br />\nThen things suddenly went<br />\nsour for the Jays. Unable to<br />\nbeat the Hopkins' defense with<br />\ntheir deliberate offense, UMBC<br />\nwas able to tally three times<br />\nwhile quickly making the transition from defense to offense,<br />\ncatching the Jays off-guard.<br />\nThe final goal came with only<br />\ntwenty-two seconds left in the<br />\nhalf and cut Hopkins lead to<br />\none, at 4-3.<br />\n\"We relaxed,\" said Coach<br />\nZimmerman. \"I thought we<br />\nwere inconsistent and we didn't<br />\nmove the ball like I wanted to.\"<br />\nLarry Quinn agreed, saying,<br />\n\"We weren't concentrating.<br />\nThey took us out of our game.<br />\nWe were just running around.\"<br />\nWhen Hopkins was penalized twice early in the third<br />\nquarter, it looked as if UMBC<br />\nmight take the lead. The Jays<br />\nheld, despite being two men<br />\ndown, and began to take control of the contest. John Tucker<br />\n<br />\nled the charge with an<br />\nunassisted goal, and Scott<br />\nfollowed with his second of the<br />\ngame while Hopkins had the<br />\nextra man. Captain Willy<br />\nOdenthal extended the lead to<br />\n7-3 off a pass from Tom<br />\nEngelke as he was lying on the<br />\nground.<br />\nThe beginning of the fourth<br />\nquarter was a continuation of<br />\nthe third as the Jays kept the<br />\npressure on UMBC's defense<br />\nand were able to score three<br />\nmore unanswered goals.<br />\nWhen the Retrievers finally<br />\nscored, it looked as if they<br />\ncouldn't be stopped. UMBC's<br />\nfifth, sixth, and seventh goals<br />\nwere all scored on fast breaks<br />\nand came within a 24 second<br />\nspan. The final goal came with<br />\nonly half a minute left, but<br />\nserved to embarrass th:, Jays<br />\nfurther. Said Coach Zimmerman,\"UMBC played well, we<br />\nwere lucky to get out with the<br />\nwin.\"<br />\nOdenthal felt the game was<br />\n\"kind of a letdown,\" while<br />\nDeTommaso stated it was \"no<br />\nindication of how we've been<br />\nworking.\"<br />\nZimmerman summed it up,<br />\nsaying, \"We have to be in the<br />\ngame for the full 60 minutes.<br />\nAnd we have to play with emostrive<br />\nfor<br />\ntion<br />\nand<br />\nconsistency.\"<br />\nThe next week against Harvard, Zimmerman got a full sixty minutes out of his team, including a first half which may<br />\nhave been the most explosive in<br />\nBlue Jay history. On the way to<br />\na 23-2 victory, Hopkins scored<br />\neighteen goals in the first thirty minutes, while shutting out<br />\nHarvard.<br />\nThe Blue Jays changed<br />\naround their midfield lines for<br />\nthis game, as Rich Glancy moved onto the first line with Del<br />\nDressel and Krumenacker, with<br />\nTucker, Mutscheller, and<br />\nSchreiber the second team, and<br />\nDavidson, Chanenchuk and<br />\nCastle the third.<br />\nOnly thirty-four seconds into the game, Dressel hit Wood<br />\nfrom behind the net and<br />\nHopkins led 1-0.<br />\nA hold by Harvard put the<br />\nBlue Jays a man up, and they<br />\nwasted little time, with Dave<br />\nCastle passing to Wood who<br />\nput it past the Harvard goalie.<br />\nThree minutes later, the Jays<br />\nscored another extra-man goal.<br />\nThis time it was Del Dressel,<br />\ntaking the pass from Castle.<br />\nSteve Mutscheller scored his<br />\nfirst goal for Hopkins, on a<br />\npass from Scott. Scott himself<br />\nscored one extra-man goal on a<br />\npass from Dressel, and<br />\nHopkins led 5-0.<br />\nWhen Del Dressel scored an<br />\nunassisted goal, it was clear that<br />\nHarvard was just not in the<br />\nsame class as Hopkins. Peter<br />\nScott scored his second goal of<br />\nthe period, with Del Dressel<br />\ngetting his third assist, and the<br />\nquarter ended with Hopkins<br />\nleading 7-0.<br />\nCoach Zimmerman began<br />\nsubstituting freely in the second<br />\nperiod as goals by Wood, Del<br />\n<br />\nDel Dressel scores against UMBC.<br />\n<br />\nDressel, Schreiber, Single, Castle, Glancy, and Tucker and<br />\nEric Dressel, with two by<br />\nBubier, gave Hopkins a 18-0<br />\nlead at the half.<br />\nWith such a big lead it was<br />\nclear that Hopkins would win,<br />\nbut Zimmerman did not want<br />\nthe team to ease. \"I told the<br />\nteam at the half,\" said Zimmerman, \"to play hard and work<br />\non the things we've been working on in practice.\"<br />\nBy the end of the game, every<br />\nHopkins player got in to play<br />\nand in a slow moving second<br />\nhalf, the Jays outscored Harvard 5-2 to win the game 23-2.<br />\nAfter replacing Larry Quinn,<br />\nwho shut out the Crimson in<br />\nthe first half, John Madden did<br />\na fine job in goal, with the two<br />\nHarvard scores coming on<br />\nclose-in shots. Eventually Madden gave way to Stuart Jones,<br />\nwho finished up the game.<br />\n\"We were embarrassed after<br />\nthe UMBC game,\" commented<br />\nZimmerman,\"and I was pleased with the way we kept up the<br />\nintensity today. Last week we<br />\nwere hurt by the transition<br />\ngame and we worked on it a lot<br />\nin practice.\"<br />\nThe Hopkins man-up offense<br />\nwas especially potent, as the<br />\nJays scored four extra-man<br />\ngoals. \"Adding Tucker and<br />\nCastle to the man-up offense<br />\nreally<br />\nhelped,\"<br />\nnoted<br />\nZimmerman.<br />\nWhile the Hopkins \"big<br />\nguns\" all had good games\u2014<br />\nWood with 3 goals, Scott with<br />\n3, Del Dressel with 3 goals and<br />\n3 assists, Zimmerman was<br />\nespecially pleased with what he<br />\ntermed \"the second half guys,\"<br />\nthose who usually don't see a<br />\nlot of action. These were led by<br />\nthe other Dressel, Eric, who<br />\nalso had 3 goals, and Bill<br />\nSingle, who scored a pair on<br />\nonly two shots.<br />\nAfter only two days off, the<br />\nJays travelled to Chestertown,<br />\nMaryland, to face Division III<br />\npower Washington College, a<br />\nteam which always plays the<br />\nJays tough.<br />\n\u2022-:L.<br />\n.1<br />\n<br />\nA<br />\n<br />\nL<br />\n<br />\nL<br />\n<br />\n'<br />\n2.\u2022.3<br />\n<br />\nAfter Navy had whipped the<br />\nShoremen 12-1 a week earlier,<br />\none would not expect such a<br />\ntough game. But Hopkins<br />\nseemed to be troubled by the<br />\ngrass field, as they only had two<br />\ndays practice on the natural<br />\nturf.<br />\nAs they had in the first two<br />\ngames, Hopkins opened the<br />\nscoring, with Scott scoring off<br />\na pass by Lee Davidson. Dave<br />\nCastle scored unassisted to give<br />\nthe Jays a 2-0 lead. Washington<br />\nCollege then closed the gap to<br />\n2-1 and late in the first period,<br />\nafter Guy Matricciani picked<br />\nup a penalty for playing with a<br />\nbroken stick, Washington<br />\nscored a man-up goal to tie the<br />\nscore as the first quarter ended.<br />\nWorking the ball around<br />\nslowly, being patient, and taking only close-in shots.<br />\nWashington College was able to<br />\ncontrol the temoo of the game.<br />\nAfter a Del Dressel shot hit the<br />\ncrossbar, Washington was able<br />\nto pick the ball up and score a<br />\ngoal to take a 3-2 lead.<br />\nMinutes later, Hopkins got a<br />\nreal scare when Del Dressel,<br />\nafter making a steal, was checked hard, and was stretched out<br />\non the ground for a few<br />\nmoments. It turned out that he<br />\nonly had the wind knocked out<br />\nof him, and returned to action<br />\nshortly afterwards.<br />\nHopkins tied the score when<br />\nPeter Scott picked up a rebound of a John Krumenacker<br />\nshot and found John Tucker<br />\nalone in front, who put the ball<br />\npast the Shoreman goalkeeper.<br />\nA Brian Wood goal then<br />\ngave Hopkins a lead they would<br />\nnot relinquish. Dressel added a<br />\ngoal to give Hopkins a 5-3<br />\nhalftime lead.<br />\nGoals by Scott and Tucker<br />\nput the Jays up 7-3, and<br />\nWashington then closed to 7-4.<br />\nThough Washington College<br />\nhad a number of good opportunities, they couldn't get the<br />\nball past Quinn. Del Dressel<br />\nscored the only goal of the final<br />\nquarter for an 8-4 Hopkins win.<br />\n\"We played well in spurts,\"<br />\n.<br />\n<br />\ni Xi-A<br />\n<br />\nA<br />\n<br />\n\u2022 \u2022 I<br />\n<br />\n6 le a,'<br />\n<br />\nthought Coach Zimmerman,<br />\n\"while they played as well as<br />\nthey probably can. We were<br />\ntired today. It's tough to get<br />\nright out of the bus and play.\"<br />\nAs for Washington's stalling<br />\ntactics, Zimmerman said,\"We<br />\nexpect most teams to slow<br />\ndown against us. We just have<br />\nto be patient and wait for the<br />\nopportunities.\"<br />\nThe Princeton Tigers did not<br />\nslow down on offense against<br />\nHopkins, and the Jays took advantage of the pace of the<br />\ngame, playing their finest contest of the still young season, as<br />\nthey romped 16-6.<br />\nWilly Odenthal opened the<br />\nscoring for Hopkins, taking a<br />\npass from behind the goal by<br />\nLee Davidson and flipping the<br />\nball into the net. Scott then<br />\nscored his first of three goals<br />\ncoming from behind the net.<br />\nBrian Wood then scored a manup goal off a jump feed from<br />\nDave Castle while Hopkins was<br />\na man-up.<br />\nThe first three, as well as<br />\neleven of the sixteen, were<br />\nscored by the attack, a turnaround from last year's middie<br />\ndominated team. Said Pete<br />\nScott, \"The Princeton defense<br />\nwas very aggressive, pushing<br />\nway out. We ran by them, moved the ball well, and the attack<br />\nwas open.<br />\nPrinceton scored a pair of<br />\ngoals to cut the lead to 3-2,<br />\nwhen Dressel got wide open at<br />\nthe right corner of the goal, and<br />\nafter taking a pass from Odenthal, scored the fourth Hopkins<br />\ngoal.<br />\nJohn Krumenacker scored<br />\nhis first goal of the season,<br />\ncrossing from the left side and<br />\nfiring a bouncer from twenty<br />\nyards out.<br />\n\"I finally got the monkey off<br />\nmy back,\" said Krumenacker.<br />\n\"I've been in a slump, but I'm<br />\nfinally out.\" Krumenacker,<br />\nscored a second goal later in the<br />\ngame.<br />\nIn the second period Wood<br />\nscored from right in front to<br />\n.<br />\ncont. on p. 19<br />\n<br />\n\f18/MARCH 30, 1984<br />\n<br />\nCourt Allows Hopkins to Play Tucker and Carswell<br />\ncont. from p. 1<br />\nthem a year of eligibilicost<br />\nfall<br />\nty, and also caused Hopkins to<br />\nviolate transfer requirements,<br />\nwhich state that a transferring<br />\nplayer cannot play with his new<br />\nteam for a full year.<br />\nMatricciani played fall<br />\nlacrosse last year and one spring<br />\ngame before breaking his jaw in<br />\npractice. A player may be considered a hardship case, and \u2022<br />\ncan be \"redshirted\" (sit out the<br />\nremainder of the season<br />\nwithout losing a year of<br />\neligibility) if he plays less than<br />\n20t, of the scheduled games.<br />\nMatricciani played three fall<br />\nand one spring game which put<br />\nhim over the limit. If only<br />\nspring games counted, he<br />\nwould not have lost a year of<br />\n<br />\neligibility.<br />\nsubmitted<br />\nHopkins<br />\nCarswell's case to the NCAA<br />\nafter the season's first game<br />\nagainst UMBC, when they<br />\nrealized he had played with the<br />\nteam in the fall of 1981.<br />\nCarswell was suspended from<br />\nthe team that spring, and<br />\nbecause he was not injured, he<br />\ncould not be redshirted. Thus<br />\nCarswell's eligibility was used<br />\nup in the first fall game he<br />\nplayed in.<br />\nTucker's case is the most<br />\nunusual of the six. Tucker did<br />\nplay fall lacrosse for Towson<br />\nState University in 1982, his<br />\nsenior year. He, however, only<br />\nappeared in two games, as he<br />\ndislocated a knuckle in a scrimmage against Penn State<br />\n<br />\nUniversity.<br />\n\"We thought Tucker was a<br />\nhardship case,\" said Scott.<br />\nBut Tucker, after transferring to Hopkins last January,<br />\nplayed for the Mount<br />\nWashington Lacrosse Club that<br />\n<br />\nWalt Carswell<br />\n<br />\nspring. There is a provision in<br />\nthe hardship rule which states<br />\nthat a player must be incapacitated for the remainder<br />\nof the season and because<br />\nTucker was not, he could not be<br />\nredshirted. Thus, the two-time<br />\nhonorable-mention<br />\nAllAmerican was declared ineligible this year.<br />\nScott does not expect the<br />\nNCAA to change their rule but<br />\nhe hopes \"we can get a grandfathering of the rule.\"<br />\nThis case may have farreaching ramifications and<br />\nseveral other schools have been<br />\naffected.

Crowe<br />\nWithout a fall baseball<br />\nseason, or any preseason<br />\ngames, the Johns Hopkins<br />\nbaseball team went down to<br />\nSanford, Florida over spring<br />\nbreak and promptly won five of<br />\nits first six games. The Blue<br />\nJays dropped the last two<br />\ngames, but returned home confident after compiling a 5-3<br />\nrecord against some of the<br />\ntoughest competition it will face<br />\nall year.<br />\nHopkins offense, which was<br />\ninconsistent at best last year,<br />\nwas impressive. The team hit as<br />\na team, with production coming from up and down the<br />\nlineup, from freshmen as well<br />\nas seniors. In Florida, the Blue<br />\nJays hit over .300 as a team and<br />\ncame home with 8 home runs<br />\n(one less than the team had all<br />\nlast year).<br />\nBut, since returning to<br />\nBaltimore, the road has become<br />\na little rockier. The team has<br />\nsplit two double-headers<br />\nagainst opponents which many<br />\nof the players considered<br />\nweaker than the teams they faced in Florida. Hopkins had difficulty putting good pitching<br />\ntogether with good hitting, and<br />\nthe team defense has been costly in a few situations.<br />\nLast Saturday, against MAC<br />\nSoutheastern divison rival<br />\nSwarthmore College, the Blue<br />\nJays dropped the first game of<br />\nthe double-header 3-1.<br />\nMark Campbell (1-2, 3.60<br />\nERA) pitched an impressive<br />\ngame after the first inning, but<br />\npicked up the loss.

Jim Hobensack led off with a single and<br />\nBobby Cardwell reached base<br />\non an error by the third<br />\nbaseman. Dan Landolphi<br />\nfollowed with a RBI single scoring Hobesack.

Often<br />\npoor foot biomechanics may be<br />\nthe culprit. Specifically, excessive pronation or \"rolling<br />\nin\" of the feet is the precursor<br />\nfor bilateral knee pain.<br />\nThis \"rolling in\" causes the<br />\nlower leg to rotate excessively,<br />\nforcing the knee caps to move<br />\nabnormally. This strains and<br />\ninflames the structures surrounding the knee, causing a<br />\ndull, aching sensation just inside and under the knee cap. It<br />\noccurs during or after strenuous<br />\nactivity, while stair climbing, or<br />\nafter prolonged sitting.<br />\nRunners are usually the victims of this problem, experiencing it during a rapid increase<br />\nin mileage, a change of shoes,<br />\nor running on excessively hilly<br />\nor banked surfaces. However,<br />\nit should be noted that bilateral<br />\nknee pain is not exclusive to<br />\nrunners. Aerobic dancers,<br />\nlacrosse, football, basketball,<br />\nsoccer, and baseball players are<br />\nalso prone to this type of<br />\ninjury.<br />\nThe proper treatment for<br />\npainful knees caused by pronated feet is the wearing of or-<br />\n<br />\nthotics or inserts in the shoes.<br />\nThese orthotics balance the feet<br />\nto prevent the \"rolling in\" effect, keeping the knee pain<br />\nfrom occuring.<br />\nAll knee pain is not due to<br />\npoor foot biomechanics.<br />\nHowever, athletes with these<br />\nsymptoms should have their<br />\nfeet examined as a possible<br />\nsource of their knee pain.<br />\nSelecting the Right Running<br />\nShoe<br />\nAn expensive running shoe is<br />\nnot necessarily a good running<br />\nshoe. Running shoes need to be<br />\npurchased according to the individual, not the cost. If this is<br />\nthe case, then what should a<br />\nrunner ask himself regarding<br />\nshoes?<br />\nLet us assume that this is the<br />\nfirst pair of running shoes to be<br />\npurchased. Your primary concern should be comfort. If the<br />\nshoes are not comfortable when<br />\nyou put them on, it is doubtful<br />\nyou will adapt to them later on.<br />\nNext, check for toe box space;<br />\nyour toes should not be<br />\ncramped and should move<br />\nabout freely. Toe length should<br />\nallow for one quarter inch in<br />\nthe front of the shoe.<br />\nSlippage in the heel should be<br />\nminimal, as an increased<br />\namount can cause blistering.<br />\nThq heel counter itself must be<br />\nfairly stiff in order to prevent<br />\nexcessive motion of the rear<br />\nfoot.<br />\nAdequate cushioning is<br />\nanother quality to look for in<br />\n<br />\nthe running shoe.

What exactly is arch pain? What is the<br />\ncause\u2014symptoms\u2014treatment?<br />\nArch pain is better known in<br />\nthe medical field as plantar<br />\nfasciitis, which is an inflammation of the soft tissue structures<br />\nattaching to the tip of the<br />\ncalcaneus or heel. This inflammatory process may or may not<br />\nbe accompanied by a heel spur.<br />\nThis can be detected on x-ray.<br />\nThe athlete complains of<br />\n<br />\npain in the arch area and<br />\nsometimes in one pinpoint location under the heel. At first, the<br />\npain is felt after the activity. As<br />\nthe problem progresses, the<br />\npain is noted at the beginning<br />\nof the activity and goes away<br />\nduring the activity only to<br />\nreturn later that evening. When<br />\nthe athlete gets up the morning<br />\nafter, he feels like he has stepped on a \"sharp spike.\"<br />\nThe cause of plantar fasciitis<br />\nor heel spurs is not definite;<br />\nhowever, some experts feel that<br />\nthese problems are due to excessive pronation of the foot<br />\nduring strenuous activities. In<br />\nother words, the plantar fascia<br />\nbecomes overstretched during<br />\nexcessive pronation, thus causing inflammation. It is believed that the heel spur is a reaction to the constant tugging of<br />\nthe plantar fascia at its attachment on the under surface of'<br />\nthe heel.<br />\nThe current treatment for<br />\nplantar fasciitis and heel spurs<br />\ninclude heel cups, felt pads,<br />\ncortisone injections, and<br />\npossibly surgery. The approach<br />\nwill depend on the physician's<br />\ndecision.<br />\nIn our foot clinic, we have<br />\nhad good success with the treatment of plantar fasciitis by<br />\nbalancing the foot using an orthotic. The purpose of the orthotic is to prevent excessive<br />\npronation of the foot, thus<br />\nalleviating the strain of the<br />\nplantar fascia.<br />\n<br />\nA<br />\nCALL FOR PAPERS<br />\n<br />\nfrom<br />\n<br />\n6:00-9:00<br />\nin the<br />\n<br />\nStudent Council Office.<br />\nfor<br />\n<br />\nSTUDENT ADVISING &<br />\nORIENTATION CHAIRMEN<br />\nSign up on the Student Council Door<br />\nJob descriptions at Student Council or<br />\nResidential Life.

In addition, the<br />\nchapters owe Colby $400,000<br />\nfor various debts.<br />\nAn overall willingness to disband the Greek organizations<br />\nmay be due in part to the<br />\nspecial commission's recommendation that Colby's<br />\nresidential life be completely<br />\nreorganized.

One<br />\nmanages, of course, during<br />\none's four-year stay at Hopkins<br />\nto accumulate a group of<br />\nfriends and acquaintances\u2014<br />\nindeed it's practically impossible not to in view of the small<br />\nsize of the undergraduate<br />\npopulation. But groups tend to<br />\nbe clicquish, and once established, difficult to break into. By<br />\nand large, good friendships are<br />\nhard to come by, and with few<br />\nexceptions<br />\nduring<br />\nan<br />\nundergraduate's career, friend-<br /><br />\nships made at Hopkins are of a<br />\nsuperficial and transient nature.<br />\nThe greatest obstacle to a<br />\nbetter social life at Hopkins is<br />\nhousing, or lack of it. During<br />\nhis first year, the freshman is<br />\nsurrounded by peers, people<br />\nwith whom he shares a great<br />\ndeal. The common bond of fear<br />\nand need for companionship in<br />\na new environment bring<br />\nfreshmen together; parties<br />\nabound, and there is ample opportunity to meet people. This<br />\nis the beginning of enduring<br />\nfriendships\u2014or should be. Unfortunately, after being forced<br />\nto move off-campus the following year and into apartments,<br />\nfriends lose contact with each<br />\nother and become increasingly<br /><br />\ninsular as their academic<br />\ndemands gain precedence over<br />\ntheir social life.<br />\nThe Hopkins student tends<br />\ntoward a natural selfcentredness, the result of strong<br />\nambition and determination to<br />\nsucceed, which draws most\u2022<br />\nstudents away from each other<br />\nand outside concerns. This selfcentredness only gets worse,<br />\nand by senior year, when the<br />\npressures of school are compounded by the pressures of<br />\ngetting a job or applying to<br />\ngraduate school, thoughts turn<br />\naway from such mundane matters as the Rat, fraternity parties, or visiting friends.<br />\nThe enforced dissociation of<br />\nstudents as they move from the<br /><br />\nAcIO<br />\naoD Ckixy CaRli?<br />\nD<br />\nWHAT SHE MFA S<br />\nWHAT SHE {I<br />\n{21<br /><br />\n\"DROVE<br />\nHI I'MDOWNFROMHERETHEWITHMIDWEST'?<br />\nSIXXXX<br />\nGUYS,<br />\nKEEP<br />\nUP WITHBUTME,THEY<br />\nSO ICOULDN'T<br />\nLEFT THEM.<br /><br />\nEY\u00b0\u00b0<br /><br />\nACTUALLY,<br />\nTHEY<br />\nME<br />\nAS<br />\nFAR<br />\nAS THETOOK<br />\nFLORIDA<br />\nBORDER,<br />\nBUT<br />\nTHEYANYCOULDN'T<br />\nTAKE<br />\nME<br />\nLONGER,<br />\nSO<br />\nTHEY DUMPED ME,'\"<br />\n\"IFOOTBALL<br />\nLIKE BASEBALL<br />\nAND<br />\nPLAYERS<br />\nMORE,<br />\nBUT<br />\nTHEY<br />\nDON'T<br />\nME ANYMORE!\"<br />\n\"IANSIPPED<br />\nA BEER<br />\nHOUR AND<br />\nFELLFORASLEEP<br />\nSTUDYING<br />\nCHEM!\"<br /><br />\n\"00000!<br />\nYOU'RE TALL!LOVEDO YOU<br />\nPLAY BASKETBALL?<br />\nBASKETBALL<br />\nCHEERLEADERPLAYERS.<br />\nAT SCHOOL..I'M A<br />\n\"MY<br />\nEYESI WAS<br />\nMUSTPARTYING<br />\nREALLY BE<br />\nRED..<br />\nVERYBAD<br />\nNIGHT.THERE\"<br />\nLATE YOULASTWEREN'T<br />\nTOO<br />\nWWI<br />\n\"WOULD<br />\nLIKE ID SLEEP SLEEP..<br />\nCOURSE, I ONLY MEAN<br />\nWITH MEYOUTONIGHT?!?!\"<br />\nMUCUS \"GOSH,<br />\nI HOPEANDYOUI WOULD...?\"<br />\nDIDN't \"IGETJUST<br />\nWANTED YOU TO<br />\nEXCITED!!!?\"<br />\nI<br /><br />\nLIKE<br /><br />\n\"Of<br /><br />\n.SEPARATELY!\"<br /><br />\nThink YOU<br /><br />\ndorms into apartments merely<br />\nexacerbates these tendencies. In<br />\nschools equally competitive as<br />\nHopkins, with students just as<br />\nconcerned with their studies<br />\nand their futures, but with<br />\nmore conducive living situations, social life thrives.<br />\nThe administration's lack of<br />\nconcern for undergraduate<br />\nsocial life has contributed to the<br />\nproblem as well. Leaving all the<br />\norganizing of campus events to<br />\nthe students just demonstrates<br />\nmore clearly the student's<br />\npreoccupation with their own<br />\nconcerns, and the problem remains. The New York Times<br />\nrecently cited a nationwide<br />\ntrend among colleges to take an<br />\nactive role in restructuring their<br />\ncampus social life; and<br />\nHopkins, not to be outdone,<br />\nhas begun to make improvements, primarily involving physical changes, like the<br />\nconstruction of new dorms.<br />\nAlthough the dorms are new,<br />\nand that in itself is a relief after<br />\nthe musty old dorms, the oldest<br />\nof which were built in the<br />\n1920's, that is not enough. Like<br />\nthe old dorms, their design<br />\ndoesn't encourage free socializing. There is still a need for<br />\nareas to gather in groups\u2014<br />\noutside the bedroom; and instead of the \"charm\" of the old<br />\ndorms, the new ones have the<br />\nantiseptic atmosphere of a<br />\nsanitarium.<br />\nWho can guess how far the<br />\ntrend will inspire Hopkins to<br />\ngo; but if the Administration<br />\ndoes decide to invest more<br />\nmoney to improve campus<br />\nsocial life, they would be wise<br />\nto heed the advice of those for<br /><br />\nwhom the changes are<br />\nintended.<br />\nMost important, there should<br />\nbe enough dorm space available<br />\nfor undergraduates to have the<br />\nchoice of living on campus or<br />\noff. In the case of those who<br />\nchoose to live off-campus, the<br />\nUniversity should take some<br />\nresponsibility for student<br />\naccomodations.<br />\nIn order to attract students to<br />\nthe dorms, there must be plenty of common space for<br />\ngathering\u2014say, for example,<br />\nlounges on every floor. Each<br />\nfloor should have a common<br />\nkitchen. Being forced to partake of the meal plan<br />\ndiscourages students from wanting to live in the dorms. Each<br />\nsuite should include at least two<br />\nbedrooms, with a common<br />\nroom for small parties,<br />\nmeetings, TV, etc. This arrangement would provide<br />\nstudents with alternative areas<br />\nfor socializing should a roommate be sleeping or studying.<br />\nWalls, of course, must then he<br />\nsoundproof.<br />\nSocial life at Hopkins is<br />\nknown to be poor\u2014at least<br />\namong the undergraduates.

I should<br />\nhave known better than to ask<br />\nhim what I had asked the<br />\nothers, because my inquiry<br />\nopened a can of worms uglier<br />\nthan both of us. He rattled on<br />\nand on about this party and<br />\nthat party; he certainly let me<br />\nknow how annoyed he and the<br />\nrest of the force were. He told<br />\nme that as intellectuals, the<br />\nHopkins students have a surprising amount of difficulty in<br />\nunderstanding the reality that<br />\nthere are people who sleep and<br />\nwork in this community at normal, eastern standard time<br />\nhours.

However, most of<br />\nour conversation focused on<br />\nthe future\u2014of the relationship.<br />\n\"There's a very thin line,\" he<br />\nsaid, \"between maintaining<br />\nacademic excellence and<br />\nacademic isolation.\" Although<br />\nours is a private institution,<br />\nJack feels that we owe ourselves<br />\nand members of the surrounding community programs that<br />\ncall for more community/campus interaction. \"There's an<br />\nabundance of senior citizens in<br />\nthis community who would enjoy participating in free activities sponsored by the<br />\nUniversity.\" He suggested that<br />\nwe have more student and<br />\nfaculty lectures offered to the<br />\npublic, and added that both<br />\nsides would benefit from this.<br />\nHe said this would not infringe<br />\nUpon Hopkins' high academic<br />\nstandards, but the University<br />\nwould increase the quality of its<br />\nwith<br />\nthe<br />\nrelationship<br />\ncommunity.<br />\nAfter speaking with Jack, I<br />\ncontacted a representative from<br />\nthe Office of Community Affairs(OCA)at Hopkins to learn<br />\nmore about his concern. I<br />\nfound that it is a concern, but<br />\nunfortunately, that's as far as<br />\nit goes. With limited funds and<br />\nParticipants, organizations such<br />\nas OCA have difficulty procuring tangible results from their<br />\nprograms. Their projects focus<br />\non youth, the elderly, integrated/segregated community functions, and economic<br />\nwell-being. These are all crucial<br />\nPoints, and hopefully their problems will be resolved soon, by<br />\nthe community's increased<br />\nawareness of some viable solutions with some help from<br />\nHopkins.<br />\nSo..if Princeton University<br />\nput Princeton, New Jersey on<br />\nthe map, can it be said that the<br />\nJohns Hopkins University put<br />\nBaltimore on the map as well?<br />\nOr is it just Charm City's<br />\nskillful drivers and the Orioles<br />\nwho gave Baltimore national<br />\nrecognition?

During these four<br />\nYears we should take advantage<br />\nof everything that Hopkins has<br />\nto offer. Participating in community projects is definitely a<br />\nworthwhile endeavor, but for<br />\nsome it cannot be the major<br />\npart of the college experience.<br />\nHowever, there is something<br />\nto be learned from the community<br />\nthat surrounds<br />\nHopkins. Somehow we must<br />\nattempt to achieve a balance<br /><br />\nbetween alienation and participation within the surrounding communities. We should<br />\nstart by trying to treat the<br />\nmembers of the community as<br />\nwe should a sleeping lion: not<br />\ntoo attentive so as to be more<br />\nbothersome than friendly but to<br />\nobserve from a pleasant<br />\ndistance. Also, we should smile<br />\nat the passing stranger. It can't<br />\nhurt, it can only help. Maybe he<br />\nwill respond to your genuine<br />\nwarmth.

With temperatures<br />\nhovering around 32 degrees and<br />\nthe field surrounded by mounds<br />\nof snow, it hardly looked like<br />\na day for lacrosse. Still, a large<br />\ncrowd showed up.<br />\nAs expected, the Jays started<br />\nWood, Odenthal, and Scott on<br />\nattack. At midfield were<br />\nDressel, Krumenacker, and<br />\nChanenchuk, and on defense<br />\nwere Matricciani, Dubin, and<br />\nDeTommasso. Larry Quinn<br />\nwas in goal.<br />\nThe game began as anticipated, with Hopkins<br />\ndominating. Scoring this<br />\nseason's first goal was the Jays'<br />\nleading scorer last year, Del<br />\nDressel, off a rebound shot by<br />\nWilly Odenthal. A few minutes<br />\nlater, Scott had the ball behind<br />\nthe goal with a middie covering<br />\nhim. Hopkins' other attackmen<br />\ncleared the crease to take advantage of the mismatch, and<br />\nScott easily beat his opponent<br />\nand stuffed the ball past the<br />\ngoalie.<br />\nThe Jays continued to control the play in the second<br />\nquarter as freshman Brian<br />\nWood got in close and \"ripped<br />\nthe net,\" putting Hopkins<br />\nahead 3-0. When Brent Ciccarone scored midway through<br />\nthe period, it looked as if<br />\nHopkins was going to run away<br />\nwith the game.<br />\nThen things suddenly went<br />\nsour for the Jays. Unable to<br />\nbeat the Hopkins' defense with<br />\ntheir deliberate offense, UMBC<br />\nwas able to tally three times<br />\nwhile quickly making the transition from defense to offense,<br />\ncatching the Jays off-guard.<br />\nThe final goal came with only<br />\ntwenty-two seconds left in the<br />\nhalf and cut Hopkins lead to<br />\none, at 4-3.<br />\n\"We relaxed,\" said Coach<br />\nZimmerman. \"I thought we<br />\nwere inconsistent and we didn't<br />\nmove the ball like I wanted to.\"<br />\nLarry Quinn agreed, saying,<br />\n\"We weren't concentrating.<br />\nThey took us out of our game.<br />\nWe were just running around.\"<br />\nWhen Hopkins was penalized twice early in the third<br />\nquarter, it looked as if UMBC<br />\nmight take the lead. The Jays<br />\nheld, despite being two men<br />\ndown, and began to take control of the contest. John Tucker<br /><br />\nled the charge with an<br />\nunassisted goal, and Scott<br />\nfollowed with his second of the<br />\ngame while Hopkins had the<br />\nextra man. Captain Willy<br />\nOdenthal extended the lead to<br />\n7-3 off a pass from Tom<br />\nEngelke as he was lying on the<br />\nground.<br />\nThe beginning of the fourth<br />\nquarter was a continuation of<br />\nthe third as the Jays kept the<br />\npressure on UMBC's defense<br />\nand were able to score three<br />\nmore unanswered goals.<br />\nWhen the Retrievers finally<br />\nscored, it looked as if they<br />\ncouldn't be stopped. UMBC's<br />\nfifth, sixth, and seventh goals<br />\nwere all scored on fast breaks<br />\nand came within a 24 second<br />\nspan. The final goal came with<br />\nonly half a minute left, but<br />\nserved to embarrass th:, Jays<br />\nfurther. Said Coach Zimmerman,\"UMBC played well, we<br />\nwere lucky to get out with the<br />\nwin.\"<br />\nOdenthal felt the game was<br />\n\"kind of a letdown,\" while<br />\nDeTommaso stated it was \"no<br />\nindication of how we've been<br />\nworking.\"<br />\nZimmerman summed it up,<br />\nsaying, \"We have to be in the<br />\ngame for the full 60 minutes.<br />\nAnd we have to play with emostrive<br />\nfor<br />\ntion<br />\nand<br />\nconsistency.\"<br />\nThe next week against Harvard, Zimmerman got a full sixty minutes out of his team, including a first half which may<br />\nhave been the most explosive in<br />\nBlue Jay history. On the way to<br />\na 23-2 victory, Hopkins scored<br />\neighteen goals in the first thirty minutes, while shutting out<br />\nHarvard.<br />\nThe Blue Jays changed<br />\naround their midfield lines for<br />\nthis game, as Rich Glancy moved onto the first line with Del<br />\nDressel and Krumenacker, with<br />\nTucker, Mutscheller, and<br />\nSchreiber the second team, and<br />\nDavidson, Chanenchuk and<br />\nCastle the third.<br />\nOnly thirty-four seconds into the game, Dressel hit Wood<br />\nfrom behind the net and<br />\nHopkins led 1-0.<br />\nA hold by Harvard put the<br />\nBlue Jays a man up, and they<br />\nwasted little time, with Dave<br />\nCastle passing to Wood who<br />\nput it past the Harvard goalie.<br />\nThree minutes later, the Jays<br />\nscored another extra-man goal.<br />\nThis time it was Del Dressel,<br />\ntaking the pass from Castle.<br />\nSteve Mutscheller scored his<br />\nfirst goal for Hopkins, on a<br />\npass from Scott. Scott himself<br />\nscored one extra-man goal on a<br />\npass from Dressel, and<br />\nHopkins led 5-0.<br />\nWhen Del Dressel scored an<br />\nunassisted goal, it was clear that<br />\nHarvard was just not in the<br />\nsame class as Hopkins.

The team has<br />\nsplit two double-headers<br />\nagainst opponents which many<br />\nof the players considered<br />\nweaker than the teams they faced in Florida. Hopkins had difficulty putting good pitching<br />\ntogether with good hitting, and<br />\nthe team defense has been costly in a few situations.<br />\nLast Saturday, against MAC<br />\nSoutheastern divison rival<br />\nSwarthmore College, the Blue<br />\nJays dropped the first game of<br />\nthe double-header 3-1.<br />\nMark Campbell (1-2, 3.60<br />\nERA) pitched an impressive<br />\ngame after the first inning, but<br />\npicked up the loss.

Often<br />\npoor foot biomechanics may be<br />\nthe culprit. Specifically, excessive pronation or \"rolling<br />\nin\" of the feet is the precursor<br />\nfor bilateral knee pain.<br />\nThis \"rolling in\" causes the<br />\nlower leg to rotate excessively,<br />\nforcing the knee caps to move<br />\nabnormally. This strains and<br />\ninflames the structures surrounding the knee, causing a<br />\ndull, aching sensation just inside and under the knee cap. It<br />\noccurs during or after strenuous<br />\nactivity, while stair climbing, or<br />\nafter prolonged sitting.<br />\nRunners are usually the victims of this problem, experiencing it during a rapid increase<br />\nin mileage, a change of shoes,<br />\nor running on excessively hilly<br />\nor banked surfaces. However,<br />\nit should be noted that bilateral<br />\nknee pain is not exclusive to<br />\nrunners. Aerobic dancers,<br />\nlacrosse, football, basketball,<br />\nsoccer, and baseball players are<br />\nalso prone to this type of<br />\ninjury.<br />\nThe proper treatment for<br />\npainful knees caused by pronated feet is the wearing of or-<br /><br />\nthotics or inserts in the shoes.<br />\nThese orthotics balance the feet<br />\nto prevent the \"rolling in\" effect, keeping the knee pain<br />\nfrom occuring.<br />\nAll knee pain is not due to<br />\npoor foot biomechanics.<br />\nHowever, athletes with these<br />\nsymptoms should have their<br />\nfeet examined as a possible<br />\nsource of their knee pain.<br />\nSelecting the Right Running<br />\nShoe<br />\nAn expensive running shoe is<br />\nnot necessarily a good running<br />\nshoe. Running shoes need to be<br />\npurchased according to the individual, not the cost. If this is<br />\nthe case, then what should a<br />\nrunner ask himself regarding<br />\nshoes?<br />\nLet us assume that this is the<br />\nfirst pair of running shoes to be<br />\npurchased. Your primary concern should be comfort. If the<br />\nshoes are not comfortable when<br />\nyou put them on, it is doubtful<br />\nyou will adapt to them later on.<br />\nNext, check for toe box space;<br />\nyour toes should not be<br />\ncramped and should move<br />\nabout freely. Toe length should<br />\nallow for one quarter inch in<br />\nthe front of the shoe.<br />\nSlippage in the heel should be<br />\nminimal, as an increased<br />\namount can cause blistering.<br />\nThq heel counter itself must be<br />\nfairly stiff in order to prevent<br />\nexcessive motion of the rear<br />\nfoot.<br />\nAdequate cushioning is<br />\nanother quality to look for in<br /><br />\nthe running shoe. Forefoot as<br />\nwell as rearfoot cushioning is<br />\nimportant; however, too much<br />\ncushioning can mean inflexibility, especially in the forefoot.<br />\nBend the shoes with your hands<br />\nand make sure they are not too<br />\nrigid.<br />\nLastly, beware of various<br />\nwedges built into the shoe. Self<br />\ndiagnosis might be your worst<br />\nenemy!<br />\nNow let us assume you are an<br />\nexperienced runner who is in<br />\nneed of a second pair of shoes.<br />\nIf you have had no running<br />\nproblems in the past, changing<br />\nthe make or model of your<br />\nshoes doesn't make sense<br />\nbecause this may only lead to<br />\nproblems you've \u2022 never- experienced before. However, if<br />\nyour running history has been<br />\nriddled with tendonitis, bursitis, or problems of that nature<br />\nin the lower extremities, a<br />\nchange of shoes might be in<br />\norder.<br />\nBefore making a change in<br />\nshoes, consider the possibility<br />\nthat your lower extremity<br />\nbiomechanics do not agree with<br />\nyour running program. The<br />\nfollowing questions should then<br />\nbe asked regarding your running protocol: Am I stretching<br />\nproperly before and after running? Have I changed my running surfaces or direction<br />\nrecently? Are my shoe wear<br />\npatterns unusual?<br />\nIf the answer is yes to any of<br />\nthe above questions, you<br />\nshould hold off from blaming<br />\nthe shoes for your problems. If<br /><br />\nThe Student Council Committee on Committees<br />\nwill be holding INTERVIEWS on<br /><br />\nMon. &amp; Tues., April 2 &amp; 3<br /><br />\nthe answer is no to all questions<br />\nwith the exception of,\"Are my<br />\nshoe wear patterns unusual?\",<br />\nthen the judgment needed<br />\nshould be that of a<br />\nprofessional.<br />\nTo discuss all abnormal shoe<br />\nwear patterns would be impossible in this newsletter;<br />\nhowever, some important clues<br />\nshould be noted. The outer<br />\naspects of both soles should be<br />\nworn down, not the middle or<br />\ninside of the sole. Also the heel<br />\ncounters must be perpendicular<br />\nto a flat surface as opposed to<br />\ntilting out or in.<br />\nAn abnormal shoe wear pattern is a hint to get your<br />\nbiomechanics checked out<br />\nbefore going through every pair<br />\nof running shoes available.<br />\nRemember, good runners<br />\nminimize problems and<br />\nenhance their ability by taking<br />\ntime to examine their<br />\nequipment.<br />\nArch Pain<br />\nMany athletes, especially<br />\nrunners, are referred to the foot<br />\nclinic with arch pain. What exactly is arch pain? What is the<br />\ncause\u2014symptoms\u2014treatment?<br />\nArch pain is better known in<br />\nthe medical field as plantar<br />\nfasciitis, which is an inflammation of the soft tissue structures<br />\nattaching to the tip of the<br />\ncalcaneus or heel. This inflammatory process may or may not<br />\nbe accompanied by a heel spur.<br />\nThis can be detected on x-ray.<br />\nThe athlete complains of<br /><br />\npain in the arch area and<br />\nsometimes in one pinpoint location under the heel. At first, the<br />\npain is felt after the activity. As<br />\nthe problem progresses, the<br />\npain is noted at the beginning<br />\nof the activity and goes away<br />\nduring the activity only to<br />\nreturn later that evening. When<br />\nthe athlete gets up the morning<br />\nafter, he feels like he has stepped on a \"sharp spike.\"<br />\nThe cause of plantar fasciitis<br />\nor heel spurs is not definite;<br />\nhowever, some experts feel that<br />\nthese problems are due to excessive pronation of the foot<br />\nduring strenuous activities. In<br />\nother words, the plantar fascia<br />\nbecomes overstretched during<br />\nexcessive pronation, thus causing inflammation. It is believed that the heel spur is a reaction to the constant tugging of<br />\nthe plantar fascia at its attachment on the under surface of'<br />\nthe heel.<br />\nThe current treatment for<br />\nplantar fasciitis and heel spurs<br />\ninclude heel cups, felt pads,<br />\ncortisone injections, and<br />\npossibly surgery. The approach<br />\nwill depend on the physician's<br />\ndecision.<br />\nIn our foot clinic, we have<br />\nhad good success with the treatment of plantar fasciitis by<br />\nbalancing the foot using an orthotic. The purpose of the orthotic is to prevent excessive<br />\npronation of the foot, thus<br />\nalleviating the strain of the<br />\nplantar fascia.<br /><br />\nA<br />\nCALL FOR PAPERS<br /><br />\nfrom<br /><br />\n6:00-9:00<br />\nin the<br /><br />\nStudent Council Office.<br />\nfor<br /><br />\nSTUDENT ADVISING &amp;<br />\nORIENTATION CHAIRMEN<br />\nSign up on the Student Council Door<br />\nJob descriptions at Student Council or<br />\nResidential Life.
