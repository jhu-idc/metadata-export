In this season of pre-exam anxiety<br />\nand worrying over next year's schedules, little thought is given to<br />\nother matters, but at any Commemoration Exercise, Class Day,<br />\nor similar function, some speaker is almost sure to allude with<br />\npride to the notables who have studied or lectured at Johns Hopkins. Woodrow-Wilson is usually the first to be mentioned.<br />\nPresident Wilson's memory has been dealt with in a number<br />\nof different ways in University courses. One of the history professors speaks of him as a political idealist who might have given<br />\nthe world some sort of a panacea in the League of Nations. Time<br />\nonly will tell, he says. Many of the students of political science<br />\nreceive a more personal view of the former President.<br />\nThe contest should be a peculiarly fitting one to students of<br />\nthis University.

That which has been generally accepted is, that they wert<br />\na portion of the loot of the early<br />\nIndian raids and were buried there<br />\nby them.<br />\n* * *<br />\nTo .continue in the line of \"buried treasure,\" an interesting assemblage of Mid-Victorian china plate<br />\nwas recently discovered by workmen at Harvard University. The<br />\npieces have been received with en\u2022 thusiasm and their pattern \u2022 will undoubtedly be used in an attempt to<br />\nperpetuate the memorie-s of all that<br />\nused to be at fair Harvard.<br />\n\u2022 Another ultra mcidern or ultra<br />\nantiquarian (take your choice) college is being established .at Carbondale, Ill. In accordance with its decrees, fraternities, dancing, athletics, and student governmeni are barred; while the uses of the filthy<br />\nweed and strong waters are. banned.<br />\nLooks like there is something worse<br />\nthan the \"New Plan\" after all.<br />\n. * * *<br />\nThe well-known weakness of the<br />\nopposite sex in regard to confectionery has again come to the fore<br />\n\u2014this time at Vassar College, where<br />\nit has confounded proponents of<br />\nthe, until \u2022then successful, Honor<br />\nSystem.

In this season of pre-exam anxiety<br />\nand worrying over next year's schedules, little thought is given to<br />\nother matters, but at any Commemoration Exercise, Class Day,<br />\nor similar function, some speaker is almost sure to allude with<br />\npride to the notables who have studied or lectured at Johns Hopkins.

One of the history professors speaks of him as a political idealist who might have given<br />\nthe world some sort of a panacea in the League of Nations. Time<br />\nonly will tell, he says.
