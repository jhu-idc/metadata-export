Since it is a philosophy which is always in a state of becoming, it is both older than its official age, and yet in some<br />\nrespects it is still in gestation.<br />\nBut whatever its age, the effects of the New Plan on campus life here at Hopkins have been pervasive.

The stories will be based upon<br />\ninterviews with persons on all levels Ntthin the University from the freshman pre-med to the<br />\nDean of the Homewood Schools.<br />\nThe News-Letter has no axe to grind.

According to<br />\nMarshall Turner, director of athletics, even in the years Hopkins<br />\nfielded its best teams the squads were always small. There was a<br />\ngroup of first line wrestlers who were good enough to win the<br />\nMason-Dixon championship five times between 1941 and 1950,<br />\nlosing only once.<br />\nThis group of first line wrestlers, however, was 90 good that<br />\nthe second stringers saw that barring an injury they would never<br />\nget into a meet and therefore, simply didn't come out. The only<br />\ndifference between those years and the present time, Mr. Turner<br />\nstated, is that Hopkins doesn't have as many of those championship first stringers. The squad size is not radically that much<br />\nsmaller.<br />\n,SITUATION SIMILAR ELSEWHERE<br />\n<br />\nThe Hopkins' situation in wrestling is paralleled in other<br />\nschools. Some schools have shown an increase in wrestling but<br />\nmany have shown a decrease similar to that at Hopkins.<br />\nThe situation at Hopkins has suddenly reached a head. Over<br />\nthe mid-year vacation freshman wrestling was dropped from the<br />\nsports program. This was brought on by very poor attendance for<br />\na practice meet with Gettysburg. Of the nine weight divisions<br />\nthat usually wrestle only five were filled by the yearling grapplers.<br />\nMr. Turner then declared that unless more interest was shown at<br />\nthe practices the following week the sport would be dropped. The<br />\nattendance only increased to seven and Mr. Turner therefore,<br />\nfelt it was unwise to continue the program.<br />\nThis puts the prospects for next year's varsity in a very<br />\nof<br />\nshaky position. Early this year Mr. Turner felt that the future<br />\nNow<br />\nfreshmen.<br />\nyear's<br />\nthis<br />\non<br />\nnext year's varsity would hinge<br />\nthe<br />\nthere are for all intents and purposes no freshmen to build<br />\nto<br />\nnecessary<br />\nsquad up to the number that Mr. Turner feels is<br />\n*arrant the continuing of sport on an intercollegiate level.<br />\nThis week the athletic director stated that he would not<br />\ntolerate the conditions under which the sport was conducted this<br />\nyear and that if he felt this situation might be duplicated next year<br />\nthe wrestling team's schedule would be cancelled sometime shortly<br />\nafter the Mason-Dixon Championships.<br />\nAs yet he has been unable to decide just how he will determine whether there is enough interest to continue the sport. In<br />\nsome way he and Mr. Rees must hare a guarantee that there will<br />\nbe in the neighborhood of fifteen candidates that will stick out<br />\nnext year.<br />\nWEIGHT LIFTING RISING<br />\n<br />\nAs the wrestling team has fallen, another group has suddenly<br />\nsprung up which seems to have a great deal of interest. This<br />\ngroup is the Homewood Bar Bell Club. The group's co-coach Brad<br />\nCaffery brags of a membership of thirty people most of whom<br />\nwork out fairly regularly. At present Caffery is attempting to win<br />\ncollegiate recognition for his organization and is preparing a<br />\noonstitution for Student Council scrutiny.<br />\nHis eventual aim is to put the weight lifting group on an<br />\nintercollegiate level of competition and hopes to make the sport<br />\na letter sport. The chances of this even with a petition to the<br />\nschool seem rather remote. The thoughts of the sudden rise and<br />\nsudden fall of the swimming team three years ago are still fresh<br />\nin the minds of the athletic policy makers and they seem certain<br />\nto be hesitant to back a new sport unless it is certain of lasting past<br />\nthe graduation of the few wlio spark-plugged the organization into<br />\nexistence.<br />\nHowever, should the group show a deep interest in the sport,<br />\nbe installed as a sport.<br />\nMr. Turner said that they probably would<br />\n_<br />\n_<br />\nHe expressd the thought that this weight lilting group might spearhead the resurgence of interest in wrestling and bring the sport<br />\nback up to lofty position that it once held.<br />\n<br />\nnight at Gettysburg. This gave<br />\nthe Reesmen a two win and four<br />\nloss record.<br />\nLou Ruland proved to be the<br />\nonly bright light in the picture for<br />\nthe Hopkins grapplers as he won<br />\na 4 to 0 decision over Sam Evangelists. This gave Ruland an unblemished record to date in the<br />\n130 pound class.<br />\nDon Woods of G-Burg started<br />\nthe evening off with a thumping<br />\n8 to 0 decision over Don Courts<br />\nin the 123 pound class. In the<br />\n137 pound weight Jim Howard<br />\npinned Nick Beier, a newcomer to<br />\nthe Jays squad, in 1.21. Hopkins<br />\nwas forced to forfeit the next<br />\nclass due to the fact nobody could<br />\nsweat down to the weight.

Since it is a philosophy which is always in a state of becoming, it is both older than its official age, and yet in some<br />\nrespects it is still in gestation.<br />\nBut whatever its age, the effects of the New Plan on campus life here at Hopkins have been pervasive.

The stories will be based upon<br />\ninterviews with persons on all levels Ntthin the University from the freshman pre-med to the<br />\nDean of the Homewood Schools.<br />\nThe News-Letter has no axe to grind.

There was a<br />\ngroup of first line wrestlers who were good enough to win the<br />\nMason-Dixon championship five times between 1941 and 1950,<br />\nlosing only once.<br />\nThis group of first line wrestlers, however, was 90 good that<br />\nthe second stringers saw that barring an injury they would never<br />\nget into a meet and therefore, simply didn't come out. The only<br />\ndifference between those years and the present time, Mr. Turner<br />\nstated, is that Hopkins doesn't have as many of those championship first stringers. The squad size is not radically that much<br />\nsmaller.<br />\n,SITUATION SIMILAR ELSEWHERE<br /><br />\nThe Hopkins' situation in wrestling is paralleled in other<br />\nschools. Some schools have shown an increase in wrestling but<br />\nmany have shown a decrease similar to that at Hopkins.<br />\nThe situation at Hopkins has suddenly reached a head. Over<br />\nthe mid-year vacation freshman wrestling was dropped from the<br />\nsports program. This was brought on by very poor attendance for<br />\na practice meet with Gettysburg. Of the nine weight divisions<br />\nthat usually wrestle only five were filled by the yearling grapplers.<br />\nMr. Turner then declared that unless more interest was shown at<br />\nthe practices the following week the sport would be dropped. The<br />\nattendance only increased to seven and Mr. Turner therefore,<br />\nfelt it was unwise to continue the program.<br />\nThis puts the prospects for next year's varsity in a very<br />\nof<br />\nshaky position. Early this year Mr. Turner felt that the future<br />\nNow<br />\nfreshmen.<br />\nyear's<br />\nthis<br />\non<br />\nnext year's varsity would hinge<br />\nthe<br />\nthere are for all intents and purposes no freshmen to build<br />\nto<br />\nnecessary<br />\nsquad up to the number that Mr. Turner feels is<br />\n*arrant the continuing of sport on an intercollegiate level.<br />\nThis week the athletic director stated that he would not<br />\ntolerate the conditions under which the sport was conducted this<br />\nyear and that if he felt this situation might be duplicated next year<br />\nthe wrestling team's schedule would be cancelled sometime shortly<br />\nafter the Mason-Dixon Championships.<br />\nAs yet he has been unable to decide just how he will determine whether there is enough interest to continue the sport. In<br />\nsome way he and Mr. Rees must hare a guarantee that there will<br />\nbe in the neighborhood of fifteen candidates that will stick out<br />\nnext year.<br />\nWEIGHT LIFTING RISING<br /><br />\nAs the wrestling team has fallen, another group has suddenly<br />\nsprung up which seems to have a great deal of interest. This<br />\ngroup is the Homewood Bar Bell Club. The group's co-coach Brad<br />\nCaffery brags of a membership of thirty people most of whom<br />\nwork out fairly regularly. At present Caffery is attempting to win<br />\ncollegiate recognition for his organization and is preparing a<br />\noonstitution for Student Council scrutiny.<br />\nHis eventual aim is to put the weight lifting group on an<br />\nintercollegiate level of competition and hopes to make the sport<br />\na letter sport. The chances of this even with a petition to the<br />\nschool seem rather remote. The thoughts of the sudden rise and<br />\nsudden fall of the swimming team three years ago are still fresh<br />\nin the minds of the athletic policy makers and they seem certain<br />\nto be hesitant to back a new sport unless it is certain of lasting past<br />\nthe graduation of the few wlio spark-plugged the organization into<br />\nexistence.<br />\nHowever, should the group show a deep interest in the sport,<br />\nbe installed as a sport.<br />\nMr. Turner said that they probably would<br />\n_<br />\n_<br />\nHe expressd the thought that this weight lilting group might spearhead the resurgence of interest in wrestling and bring the sport<br />\nback up to lofty position that it once held.<br /><br />\nnight at Gettysburg. This gave<br />\nthe Reesmen a two win and four<br />\nloss record.<br />\nLou Ruland proved to be the<br />\nonly bright light in the picture for<br />\nthe Hopkins grapplers as he won<br />\na 4 to 0 decision over Sam Evangelists.
