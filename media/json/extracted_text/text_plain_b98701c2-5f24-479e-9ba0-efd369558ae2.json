Social concern is not<br />\na luxury that we can do without, but a necessity for the<br />\nhuman vitality of any community; it is a commodity that<br />\nwe possess only in the accidental minimum of inevitability.<br />\nIt is inevitable that a few of the thousands of men<br />\nwho inhabit or frequent this island, Hopkins, must be<br />\naware of problems outside these confines and willing to<br />\nact toward their solution. So CONCERN has come and<br />\ngone, to he fortunately superseded by the Students for a<br />\nDemocratic Society. After these very active agents of<br />\nliberal thought come the Young Democrats and Young<br />\nRepublicans, which groups deserve the name of organized awareness, if not the name of action. These groups<br />\ncomprise a minority upon which most of us look with<br />\ndisdain, if at all. Perhaps we are peculiar in our attitude<br />\nand ignorance, for on the campuses of other \"best\"<br />\ncolleges and universities, political thought and social<br />\naction are an accepted part of life, if not the ruling<br />\npassion.<br />\nWe really have no right to feel that the demands of<br />\nindividuality prevent our involvement with the faceless<br />\nmass of society. The beat generation has grown up, and<br />\nseems to have been replaced here by a generation of<br />\nlazy self-interest. We need not ask ourselves to jump in<br />\nand conform, as that is not the issue. The issues are<br />\nunemployment and poverty, prejudice and injustice, war<br />\nand peace. We need to think and act, after deciding to<br />\ncare, rather than ignore in a comfortable apathy.<br />\nNo doubt we all agree that the university life should<br />\nbe a human experience as well as an educational one;<br />\nthat an educated individual and a mature social being<br />\nshould he one and the same product here. Maturity as<br />\nperceived in the serious undergraduate-in-a-fog is but an<br />\nillusion if maturity means to be fully grown. To be a<br />\ngrown and functional human being involves a great deal<br />\nof distinctively human responsibility that most of us will<br />\nnot be able to ignore forever.

Be that as it<br />\nmay, it seems that at least one<br />\nof us is. Bob Smith, a senior in<br />\nArts and Sciences, has reached<br />\nwhat is considered in some circles the pinnacle of social success: an invitation to dinner at<br />\nthe White House (the one in<br />\nWashington).<br />\n<br />\nThe occasion is a buffet in<br />\nhonor of student leaders from<br />\nrepresentative colleges and universities across the country. According to the White House,<br />\nthese students, \"while maintaining a good academic record have<br />\nalso shown special qualities of<br />\ncharacter, leadership, and interest in college affairs.\"<br />\nThe News-Letter asked Smith<br />\nhow he happened to be<br />\ngiven the invitation; he confessed that he wasn't really sure.<br />\n\"Last Friday, I got a call from<br />\n<br />\nHomewood Scene<br />\n<br />\nComposition Piglet<br />\nBy JIM FREEDMAN<br />\n<br />\nRoss Jones, (one of Dr. Eisenhower's assistants) who asked<br />\nme to drop over to Homewood<br />\nHouse.

They know that the issue<br />\nof discrimination is charged with the emotion that usually leads to the formation of two adamant and opposing<br />\ngroups. Students recognize the problem, but they know<br />\nthat it cannot be solved unless an outburst of that emotion is prevented.<br />\nNo solution will he found unless fortitude and<br />\npatience are shown by all concerned. Nor will any<br />\nsolution be found unless those who seek to end discrimination also try to understand the problems of whatever fraternities are involved.<br />\nThere are many aspects to the problems of discrimination in fraternities. Most people will agree that<br />\ndiscrimination according to race or religion is wrong.<br />\nOn the other hand, few will disagree that one should<br />\nbe able to choose his friends according to whatever<br />\nstandards he sets. And a fraternity is essentially a group<br />\nof friends. We cannot, however, drop the matter here,<br />\nbecause fraternities are an integral part of the University.<br />\nBy allowing fraternity men to visit the dormitories<br />\nto rush freshmen, the University is, in effect, supporting<br />\nfraternities. The involvement of the University, whether<br />\nintended or not, makes the problem of discrimination<br />\nin fraternities a valid subject for discussion in the Student Council and the finding of a solution to that problem essential.

There is, however, another lack which should<br />\nhave priority for correction.<br />\nTo turn a phrase, \"a lot of learning is a dangerous<br />\nthing.\" Too easily the undergraduate, whether intense<br />\nfor knowledge or enrolled by chance and the new convention of taking a degree, adapts to the rarified air of<br />\nacademia by hermetically sealing himself off from the<br />\nless pure airs of our larger society. Social concern is not<br />\na luxury that we can do without, but a necessity for the<br />\nhuman vitality of any community; it is a commodity that<br />\nwe possess only in the accidental minimum of inevitability.<br />\nIt is inevitable that a few of the thousands of men<br />\nwho inhabit or frequent this island, Hopkins, must be<br />\naware of problems outside these confines and willing to<br />\nact toward their solution. So CONCERN has come and<br />\ngone, to he fortunately superseded by the Students for a<br />\nDemocratic Society. After these very active agents of<br />\nliberal thought come the Young Democrats and Young<br />\nRepublicans, which groups deserve the name of organized awareness, if not the name of action. These groups<br />\ncomprise a minority upon which most of us look with<br />\ndisdain, if at all. Perhaps we are peculiar in our attitude<br />\nand ignorance, for on the campuses of other \"best\"<br />\ncolleges and universities, political thought and social<br />\naction are an accepted part of life, if not the ruling<br />\npassion.<br />\nWe really have no right to feel that the demands of<br />\nindividuality prevent our involvement with the faceless<br />\nmass of society. The beat generation has grown up, and<br />\nseems to have been replaced here by a generation of<br />\nlazy self-interest. We need not ask ourselves to jump in<br />\nand conform, as that is not the issue. The issues are<br />\nunemployment and poverty, prejudice and injustice, war<br />\nand peace. We need to think and act, after deciding to<br />\ncare, rather than ignore in a comfortable apathy.<br />\nNo doubt we all agree that the university life should<br />\nbe a human experience as well as an educational one;<br />\nthat an educated individual and a mature social being<br />\nshould he one and the same product here. Maturity as<br />\nperceived in the serious undergraduate-in-a-fog is but an<br />\nillusion if maturity means to be fully grown. To be a<br />\ngrown and functional human being involves a great deal<br />\nof distinctively human responsibility that most of us will<br />\nnot be able to ignore forever. Though each man's first<br />\nresponsibility is to himself, if not to God, the rest of<br />\nJinen cannot be ignored.<br />\nUpon graduation, most of us will have social involvement thrust upon us by the exigencies of occupation and housekeeping in some community. Why wait?<br />\n'Why separate ourselves from the world as long as passible? Far from deserving this little vacation on the<br />\ngreen and in the stacks, as future leaders in the world we<br />\nneed some education in its ways. A man not involved<br />\nwith the rest of the world is an island, and a handful<br />\nof dust is the lowest state of man.<br /><br />\nHOMEWOOD, BALTIMORE, OCTOBER 2, 1964<br /><br />\nHoppie in the White House<br />\nBy STEPHEN JARRETT<br />\nWe understand, from what<br />\nwe've been told by a few of our<br />\nlady friends, that Johns Hopkins<br />\nmen aren't as socially acceptable<br />\nas they might be.

They know that the issue<br />\nof discrimination is charged with the emotion that usually leads to the formation of two adamant and opposing<br />\ngroups. Students recognize the problem, but they know<br />\nthat it cannot be solved unless an outburst of that emotion is prevented.<br />\nNo solution will he found unless fortitude and<br />\npatience are shown by all concerned. Nor will any<br />\nsolution be found unless those who seek to end discrimination also try to understand the problems of whatever fraternities are involved.<br />\nThere are many aspects to the problems of discrimination in fraternities. Most people will agree that<br />\ndiscrimination according to race or religion is wrong.<br />\nOn the other hand, few will disagree that one should<br />\nbe able to choose his friends according to whatever<br />\nstandards he sets. And a fraternity is essentially a group<br />\nof friends. We cannot, however, drop the matter here,<br />\nbecause fraternities are an integral part of the University.<br />\nBy allowing fraternity men to visit the dormitories<br />\nto rush freshmen, the University is, in effect, supporting<br />\nfraternities. The involvement of the University, whether<br />\nintended or not, makes the problem of discrimination<br />\nin fraternities a valid subject for discussion in the Student Council and the finding of a solution to that problem essential.
