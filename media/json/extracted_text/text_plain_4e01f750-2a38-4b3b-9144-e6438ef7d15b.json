Before the game, everything pointed towards an easy victory for the Annapolitans. They<br />\noutweighed the Hopkins players by<br />\nat least fifteen pounds to a man,<br />\nand started football practice about<br />\ntwo weeks earlier, with every man<br />\nin the squad reporting on the first<br />\nday. The victory is of small credit<br />\nto the Navy team under these circumstances, and with the exception<br />\nof being saved at the last moment<br />\nfrom the ignominy of defeat at the<br />\nhands of Hopkins, the Middies can<br />\nderive little consolation from the<br />\nresult.<br />\nCaptain Gillett put Hopkins in the<br />\nlead early in the first quarter, by<br />\ndrop-kicking a field goal from the<br />\n25-yard line, after Hopkins had<br />\nsecured the pigskin within striking<br />\ndistance of the Middie's goal, as<br />\na rrsult of a fumble and several<br />\nmisplays on the part of Navy players. Navy then tried to carry the<br />\nball through the Hopkins line by<br />\nsheer weight. Although Navy<br />\nmade first downs at various times<br />\nthroughout the game by line plunging, the Hopkins defence was strong<br />\nenough to prevent Navy from<br />\nsteadily advancing the ball by this<br />\nmeans.<br />\nAfter scoring the field goal, Hopkins was on the defense most of the<br />\ntime, and put up one of the gamest<br />\nfights ever seen at Annapolis. Time<br />\nand again, after bertng blocked at<br />\nevery turn by the comparatively<br />\nlight Hopkins line, the future admirals were forced to resort to<br />\npunting. Alexander and Ccillins of<br />\nthe Navy eleven made a number of<br />\nexcellent punts during the game,<br />\nand the Hopkins backfield handled<br />\nthe kicks very poorly. Under anything -like an even break of luck the<br />\nNavy team would have gained on<br />\nalmost all the exchanges of punts,<br />\nbut after misjudging kicks, the Hopkins backs usually secured the ball<br />\nowing to lucky bounces of the p;gskin after striking the gridiron.<br />\nThe first half ended with the<br />\nscore still 3 to o. The Hopkins<br />\nrooters who had journeyed to the<br />\nState capital to see the game could<br />\nhardly believe what they had seen<br />\nwith their eyes, and the Middies<br />\nseemed dazed and lifeless. The<br />\n<br />\nOnce again the Y. M. C. A.flung<br />\nopen its hospitable doors to welcom.the new students to their new life<br />\nat Hopkins. Once again a feast<br />\nwas spread, worthy of the gods, but<br />\nwhat's much more practical just<br />\nabout suited to the taste of everybody present. But before the doors<br />\nof. the inner room, where the ice<br />\ncream and cake were laid out, were<br />\nthrown open, the students present<br />\n<br />\nThere is a much larger squad at<br />\nHomewood every , afternoon than<br />\nhas ever been known in the history<br />\nof Hopkins football. Most of the<br />\ncredit for this big showing is due<br />\nthe classes of 1914 and 1916. The<br />\njuniors have nine representatives<br />\non the field, and the freshmen fourteen. The 1916 men deserve a good<br />\ndeal of credit for the show they<br />\nare making, and the sophies will<br />\n<br />\nOn Thursday evening, the Y. M.<br />\nC. A. of the Medical School held its<br />\nannual reception to the incoming<br />\nclass. Upon enterinc, the lobby,<br />\neach man was labelled with his<br />\nname and class, after which he proceeded to get acquainted with the<br />\nmany whom he did not know, girls<br />\nincluded, for at the Medical School<br />\nco-eds are invited to Y. M. C. A.<br />\nreceptions. This looks odd to the<br />\nnew men, but they soon get used to<br />\nthem. About 9.30 the real enjoyment began, for as President Remsen said in the first speech of the<br />\nevening: \"Speech-making is the<br />\nAmerican way of having a good<br />\ntime.\" He also stated that the University was going to move to<br />\nHomewood and would no doubt be<br />\nthere by the time the entering class<br />\ngraduated. The real significance<br />\nof this remark can only be appreciated by a Hopkins undergraduate<br />\nof an upper class. He was followed<br />\nby Dean Williams, Dr. Kelly, Dr.<br />\nFinney and Dr. Howell, all of<br />\nwhom, by their wit, thoroughly<br />\nmixed with good, sound advice,<br />\nmade the men feel glad they had<br />\ncome.<br />\nPossibly the strongest and most<br />\nimportant thing said, was when Dr.<br />\nKelly stated that if a student during his four years at the Medical<br />\nSchool threw off the spiritual ties<br />\nof his earlier life, he lost what was<br />\nworth more to him than anything<br />\nlie could possibly gain while there,<br />\nno matter if when he graduated he<br />\nwas pronounced the most brilliant<br />\nscholar who had ever received a<br />\n(liploma.<br />\nAnother thing mentioned was that<br />\nthe present entering class is the<br />\nfirst to be selected from a larger<br />\nnumber of applicants\u2014the class being limited to ninety-five.<br />\nA point from Dean Williams'<br />\nspeech of interest to all Hopkins<br />\nmen was that because the Medical<br />\nSchool is just as much a part of<br />\nthe University as the Graduate<br />\nSchool or any other branch, the<br />\nmedical students are therefore entitled to play on University teams,<br />\nand he stated that within reason the<br />\nmedical faculty not only tolerated<br />\nsuch a diversion from study but<br />\nurged the students to go out for<br />\nthe teams.<br />\nMr. Faust closed the talks by a<br />\nstatement of the works of the Y.<br />\nM.

A. and the part which should<br />\nbe taken by the students.<br />\nThe evening closed with a general<br />\ngood time in the way of a feed and<br />\ndance<br />\n<br />\n(Continued on page 6, col. 2.)<br />\n<br />\n\u2022<br />\n<br />\nTHE SQUAD THAT GAVE THE NAVY A HARD RUB.<br />\n<br />\nwere entertained by a series of<br />\nspeeches in which they were told<br />\nof. various Hopkins activities\u2014not<br />\nwithout reference to the very serious activity of study.<br />\nDr. Magoffin, president of the<br />\nY. M. C. A., said he would have<br />\nto make the same kind of mistake<br />\na little boy made who translated<br />\nthe first line of Cxsar's Gallic Wars<br />\nas: \"All Gaul is quarted in three<br />\nparts,\" for he wished to say that<br />\nto be an all around man, one has<br />\nto have three sides\u2014mind, body,<br />\nspirit. He then introduced various<br />\nspeakers, who told the new men<br />\nhow to develop their three sides.<br />\nThe first speaker, President Remsen, said that when the University<br />\nwas first opened it was hoped that<br />\nstudents would be willing to come<br />\nand study without expecting any<br />\ndegree as a reward for doing specified work; but it was soon found<br />\nthat without some definite program<br />\nto go by, the students made hash<br />\nof their studies. But now that a<br />\ndegree is given, the graduate students do only the work required<br />\n<br />\nhave to hustle to put up a team<br />\nagainst them.

The founder of<br />\nthis famous annual prize for poetry<br />\nwas Sir Roger Newdigate, who<br />\ndied in 1806, and was a scholar of<br />\nconsiderable excellence. A glance<br />\nthrough the list of winners durinothe more than a century since the<br />\nestablishment of this prize reveals<br />\nthe fact that the honor has been<br />\nsecured by very few who have subsequently risen to great eminence<br />\nin the field of letters. It is worth<br />\nwhile, however, to be placed in the<br />\nsame class with such men as Principal Shairp, Dean Stanley, Dean<br />\nMilman, F. W. Faber, John Ruskin, Matthew Arnold, John Addington Symonds and Edwin Arnold.<br />\n<br />\nESTABLISHED 1818<br />\n<br />\nieeded<br />\n<br />\nyeah<br />\n-<br />\n<br />\nC\u00e7LOTHIING<br />\nrntlrttirico rurntelitit0\u2022<br />\nBROADWAY<br />\n<br />\nTWENTY\u2022SECOND ST.<br />\n<br />\nCCM<br />\nP.C.W<br />\n<br />\nYORK.<br />\n<br />\nFLANNELS FOR TOWN AND<br />\nCOUNTRY<br />\nSOFT AND STRAW HATS<br />\nOUTFITTINGS FOR TRAVEL AT<br />\nHOME OR ABROAD<br />\n<br />\nSend for Illustrated Catalogue.<br />\n<br />\nThe Chas.

Your<br />\nstudies at college will not be, for<br />\nthe most part, the mechanical subjects of the high school curriculum,<br />\nwhich require only an exercise of<br />\nthe memory. They will not only<br />\nmake it necessary for you to think,<br />\nbut they will teach you how to<br />\nthink, and you will find that in the<br />\nlast analysis, ability to think is<br />\nequally as valuable as a knowledge<br />\nof human nature.<br />\nA Transition Year.<br />\n<br />\nThe present year is a year of<br />\ntransition in the life of the University.

All this attracted me much<br />\nmore than the rules about solecisms;<br />\nbut I had strength to resist and ran<br />\nquickly into McCoy Hall.<br />\nIn passing before the blackboard<br />\nin the basement, where notices are<br />\nposted, I saw a number of fellows<br />\nstopping. I thought to myself<br />\nwithout stopping, \"What can it be<br />\nnow?\" Then, as I was runnng<br />\nthrough the basement, the barber,<br />\nWalter, who was there with Sam,<br />\non his way to read the notice, cried<br />\nout to me: \"Don't be in such a<br />\nhurry, sir, you will be quite early<br />\nenough for your class.\"<br />\nI thought he was making fun of<br />\n<br />\nT14E<br />\nSMOOTHE5T<br />\n<br />\nTOBACCO'<br />\n<br />\nFT in the moony night with pipe and Velvet<br />\n\u2014that's enjoyment enough for some of us.<br />\n<br />\nO<br />\n<br />\nVelvet tobacco\u2014the finest leaf in the great tobacco<br />\ncountry\u2014hung in big warehouses for over 2 years\u2014a<br />\nmellowing process impossible to counterfeit\u2014only time,<br />\nlittle by little, can change the leaf\u2014eliminate the harshness(you call it bite!).

I noticed that he had on his<br />\ndress suit, which, till that day, he<br />\nhad not worn, except when he intended addressing the Woman's<br />\nLiterary Club of Roland Park.<br />\n\"Gentlemen,\" he said, \"this is the<br />\nlast time that I shall teach you Hill's<br />\nRhetoric. The order has come<br />\nfrom the authorities that only<br />\nBrewster's English Composition is<br />\nto be taught in this class henceforward. The new books arrive tomorrow. Today is your last lesson in Hill. I shall ask you to be<br />\nvery attentive.\"<br />\nAh, the wretch! This, then, was<br />\nwhat had been posted in the basement.<br />\nMy last lesson in Hill! How I<br />\nlonged for the wasted time, for the<br />\nclasses I had cut to promenade<br />\nCharles street, or to go to the<br />\nAlcazar. The book which I usuairy found so dry, so heavy to carry,<br />\nnow seemed to me an old friend<br />\nwith whom I was very sorry to<br />\npart.<br />\nThen, after speaking of one thing<br />\nand 'another, Dr. French began to<br />\ntalk to us about Hill's Rhetoric,saying that it was the most logical in the<br />\nworld, the clearest, best in technique.<br />\nThe lecture finished, we passed to<br />\nwriting a theme on the spire of the<br />\nFirst Church. From time to time,<br />\nwhen I raised my eyes from the<br />\npage, I saw Dr. French motionless<br />\nin his chair, looking fixedly at his<br />\nHill, as if he would like to absorb<br />\nin his eyes the very letters of the<br />\nbook. Think of it! For seven<br />\nyears he had taught the same book,<br />\nand he had studied out of it himself. What a heart-break it must be<br />\nfor this poor man to leave his<br />\nbook! All the same, what courage<br />\nhe had to carry out the class to<br />\nthe end!<br />\nSuddenly the ten-minutes-of bell<br />\nsounded, then the hour. At the<br />\nsame moment, the tramp of the students changing classes was heard.<br />\nDr. French rose from his chair,<br />\nturning very pale. Never had he<br />\nlooked so tall.<br />\n\"My friends,\" he said, \"my<br />\nfriends, I\u2014I.\" But something<br />\nchoked him. He could not finish<br />\nthe sentence. Then he turned to the<br />\nblackboard, took a piece of chalk,<br />\nand pressing with all his might, he<br />\nwrote as large as he could: \"Long<br />\nLive Hill.\"<br />\nThen he remained there, leaning<br />\nhis head against the wall, and, without speaking, with his hand made<br />\nthe sign to us: \"All is over; you<br />\nG.

Before the game, everything pointed towards an easy victory for the Annapolitans. They<br />\noutweighed the Hopkins players by<br />\nat least fifteen pounds to a man,<br />\nand started football practice about<br />\ntwo weeks earlier, with every man<br />\nin the squad reporting on the first<br />\nday. The victory is of small credit<br />\nto the Navy team under these circumstances, and with the exception<br />\nof being saved at the last moment<br />\nfrom the ignominy of defeat at the<br />\nhands of Hopkins, the Middies can<br />\nderive little consolation from the<br />\nresult.<br />\nCaptain Gillett put Hopkins in the<br />\nlead early in the first quarter, by<br />\ndrop-kicking a field goal from the<br />\n25-yard line, after Hopkins had<br />\nsecured the pigskin within striking<br />\ndistance of the Middie's goal, as<br />\na rrsult of a fumble and several<br />\nmisplays on the part of Navy players. Navy then tried to carry the<br />\nball through the Hopkins line by<br />\nsheer weight. Although Navy<br />\nmade first downs at various times<br />\nthroughout the game by line plunging, the Hopkins defence was strong<br />\nenough to prevent Navy from<br />\nsteadily advancing the ball by this<br />\nmeans.<br />\nAfter scoring the field goal, Hopkins was on the defense most of the<br />\ntime, and put up one of the gamest<br />\nfights ever seen at Annapolis. Time<br />\nand again, after bertng blocked at<br />\nevery turn by the comparatively<br />\nlight Hopkins line, the future admirals were forced to resort to<br />\npunting. Alexander and Ccillins of<br />\nthe Navy eleven made a number of<br />\nexcellent punts during the game,<br />\nand the Hopkins backfield handled<br />\nthe kicks very poorly. Under anything -like an even break of luck the<br />\nNavy team would have gained on<br />\nalmost all the exchanges of punts,<br />\nbut after misjudging kicks, the Hopkins backs usually secured the ball<br />\nowing to lucky bounces of the p;gskin after striking the gridiron.<br />\nThe first half ended with the<br />\nscore still 3 to o. The Hopkins<br />\nrooters who had journeyed to the<br />\nState capital to see the game could<br />\nhardly believe what they had seen<br />\nwith their eyes, and the Middies<br />\nseemed dazed and lifeless. The<br /><br />\nOnce again the Y. M. C. A.flung<br />\nopen its hospitable doors to welcom.the new students to their new life<br />\nat Hopkins. Once again a feast<br />\nwas spread, worthy of the gods, but<br />\nwhat's much more practical just<br />\nabout suited to the taste of everybody present. But before the doors<br />\nof. the inner room, where the ice<br />\ncream and cake were laid out, were<br />\nthrown open, the students present<br /><br />\nThere is a much larger squad at<br />\nHomewood every , afternoon than<br />\nhas ever been known in the history<br />\nof Hopkins football. Most of the<br />\ncredit for this big showing is due<br />\nthe classes of 1914 and 1916. The<br />\njuniors have nine representatives<br />\non the field, and the freshmen fourteen. The 1916 men deserve a good<br />\ndeal of credit for the show they<br />\nare making, and the sophies will<br /><br />\nOn Thursday evening, the Y. M.<br />\nC. A. of the Medical School held its<br />\nannual reception to the incoming<br />\nclass. Upon enterinc, the lobby,<br />\neach man was labelled with his<br />\nname and class, after which he proceeded to get acquainted with the<br />\nmany whom he did not know, girls<br />\nincluded, for at the Medical School<br />\nco-eds are invited to Y. M. C. A.<br />\nreceptions. This looks odd to the<br />\nnew men, but they soon get used to<br />\nthem. About 9.30 the real enjoyment began, for as President Remsen said in the first speech of the<br />\nevening: \"Speech-making is the<br />\nAmerican way of having a good<br />\ntime.\" He also stated that the University was going to move to<br />\nHomewood and would no doubt be<br />\nthere by the time the entering class<br />\ngraduated. The real significance<br />\nof this remark can only be appreciated by a Hopkins undergraduate<br />\nof an upper class. He was followed<br />\nby Dean Williams, Dr. Kelly, Dr.<br />\nFinney and Dr. Howell, all of<br />\nwhom, by their wit, thoroughly<br />\nmixed with good, sound advice,<br />\nmade the men feel glad they had<br />\ncome.<br />\nPossibly the strongest and most<br />\nimportant thing said, was when Dr.<br />\nKelly stated that if a student during his four years at the Medical<br />\nSchool threw off the spiritual ties<br />\nof his earlier life, he lost what was<br />\nworth more to him than anything<br />\nlie could possibly gain while there,<br />\nno matter if when he graduated he<br />\nwas pronounced the most brilliant<br />\nscholar who had ever received a<br />\n(liploma.<br />\nAnother thing mentioned was that<br />\nthe present entering class is the<br />\nfirst to be selected from a larger<br />\nnumber of applicants\u2014the class being limited to ninety-five.<br />\nA point from Dean Williams'<br />\nspeech of interest to all Hopkins<br />\nmen was that because the Medical<br />\nSchool is just as much a part of<br />\nthe University as the Graduate<br />\nSchool or any other branch, the<br />\nmedical students are therefore entitled to play on University teams,<br />\nand he stated that within reason the<br />\nmedical faculty not only tolerated<br />\nsuch a diversion from study but<br />\nurged the students to go out for<br />\nthe teams.<br />\nMr. Faust closed the talks by a<br />\nstatement of the works of the Y.<br />\nM.

All this attracted me much<br />\nmore than the rules about solecisms;<br />\nbut I had strength to resist and ran<br />\nquickly into McCoy Hall.<br />\nIn passing before the blackboard<br />\nin the basement, where notices are<br />\nposted, I saw a number of fellows<br />\nstopping. I thought to myself<br />\nwithout stopping, \"What can it be<br />\nnow?\" Then, as I was runnng<br />\nthrough the basement, the barber,<br />\nWalter, who was there with Sam,<br />\non his way to read the notice, cried<br />\nout to me: \"Don't be in such a<br />\nhurry, sir, you will be quite early<br />\nenough for your class.\"<br />\nI thought he was making fun of<br /><br />\nT14E<br />\nSMOOTHE5T<br /><br />\nTOBACCO'<br /><br />\nFT in the moony night with pipe and Velvet<br />\n\u2014that's enjoyment enough for some of us.<br /><br />\nO<br /><br />\nVelvet tobacco\u2014the finest leaf in the great tobacco<br />\ncountry\u2014hung in big warehouses for over 2 years\u2014a<br />\nmellowing process impossible to counterfeit\u2014only time,<br />\nlittle by little, can change the leaf\u2014eliminate the harshness(you call it bite!).

I noticed that he had on his<br />\ndress suit, which, till that day, he<br />\nhad not worn, except when he intended addressing the Woman's<br />\nLiterary Club of Roland Park.<br />\n\"Gentlemen,\" he said, \"this is the<br />\nlast time that I shall teach you Hill's<br />\nRhetoric. The order has come<br />\nfrom the authorities that only<br />\nBrewster's English Composition is<br />\nto be taught in this class henceforward. The new books arrive tomorrow. Today is your last lesson in Hill. I shall ask you to be<br />\nvery attentive.\"<br />\nAh, the wretch! This, then, was<br />\nwhat had been posted in the basement.<br />\nMy last lesson in Hill! How I<br />\nlonged for the wasted time, for the<br />\nclasses I had cut to promenade<br />\nCharles street, or to go to the<br />\nAlcazar. The book which I usuairy found so dry, so heavy to carry,<br />\nnow seemed to me an old friend<br />\nwith whom I was very sorry to<br />\npart.<br />\nThen, after speaking of one thing<br />\nand 'another, Dr. French began to<br />\ntalk to us about Hill's Rhetoric,saying that it was the most logical in the<br />\nworld, the clearest, best in technique.<br />\nThe lecture finished, we passed to<br />\nwriting a theme on the spire of the<br />\nFirst Church. From time to time,<br />\nwhen I raised my eyes from the<br />\npage, I saw Dr. French motionless<br />\nin his chair, looking fixedly at his<br />\nHill, as if he would like to absorb<br />\nin his eyes the very letters of the<br />\nbook. Think of it! For seven<br />\nyears he had taught the same book,<br />\nand he had studied out of it himself. What a heart-break it must be<br />\nfor this poor man to leave his<br />\nbook! All the same, what courage<br />\nhe had to carry out the class to<br />\nthe end!<br />\nSuddenly the ten-minutes-of bell<br />\nsounded, then the hour. At the<br />\nsame moment, the tramp of the students changing classes was heard.<br />\nDr. French rose from his chair,<br />\nturning very pale. Never had he<br />\nlooked so tall.<br />\n\"My friends,\" he said, \"my<br />\nfriends, I\u2014I.\" But something<br />\nchoked him. He could not finish<br />\nthe sentence. Then he turned to the<br />\nblackboard, took a piece of chalk,<br />\nand pressing with all his might, he<br />\nwrote as large as he could: \"Long<br />\nLive Hill.\"<br />\nThen he remained there, leaning<br />\nhis head against the wall, and, without speaking, with his hand made<br />\nthe sign to us: \"All is over; you<br />\nG.

The<br />\nheavy Navy backs then advanced<br />\nthe spheroid by line plunging, and<br />\nGilchrist, the Navy quarterback,<br />\ncarried it across the line. Alexander kicked' goal.
