The academic challenge at this<br />\nUniversity presents something new and different for every<br />\nfreshman; yet, it is not the most valuable part of being a<br />\nstudent here. Everyone has had classes before, in prep or<br />\nhigh school and before that in grammar school. Many will<br />\ngo on to still more classes in other institutions after leaving<br />\nHopkins. Through an academic program here, a person can<br />\nlearn a great deal, grow intellectually, and prepare for a<br />\ncareer later in life. But by themselves, classes are not the<br />\nrichest part of being a student at Johns Hopkins.<br />\nThe total life experience available to an undergraduate<br />\nenrolled at this University is of tremendous value. It is a<br />\nfairy-tale method for passing from the adolescent to the<br />\nadult world. A student can arrange his life any way he<br />\nchooses; yet he is still protected in some ways by a guardian<br />\nangel, the University. People who circulate about<br />\nHomewood are nothing if not diverse; birds of all kinds find<br />\nthemselves Blue Jays. You might come across an expert<br />\nchess player or scuba diver, or somebody who has been to<br />\nTogo and back. You will definitely come across somebody<br />\nwho can wiggle a webbed stick. The male-female student<br />\nratio is lamentable, but still the social scene at Hopkins<br />\noffers great potential for stimulation.<br />\nRegrettably, a considerable number of undergraduates at<br />\nthis University consider their present occupation as simply a<br />\nmeans to an end. No matter how successfully they may<br />\npursue their goals, they waste their time here. The JHU<br />\nexperience can and should be fulfilling in itself...<br />\nSo relax and enjoy your stay at Johns Hopkins--it's a part<br />\nof your life that you will only have once.<br />\n<br />\nGood Luck, GRO<br />\nGraduate students form an unusually large and active<br />\npart of the Hopkins community. Thus, the recent move to<br />\nestablish an organization to represent them here comes as a<br />\nwelcome break I from the customary philosophy of<br />\nindependent dealings within each department. The potential<br />\nfor unity among grads in all fields stands out as a promising<br />\nfeature of the proposed group.<br />\nAn effective organization could obtain tangible benefits<br />\nfor its constituents. Financial dealings between the<br />\nacademic departments and their graduate students, like too<br />\nmuch of what occurs in faculty circles, have<br />\ntraditionally been shrouded in secrecy. This situation is<br />\nagainst the interests of most grads, since they have .no real<br />\nway of knowing how much stipend students have received<br />\nin the vast and in other departments. An active G.R.O.<br />\ncould notionly articulate graduate student needs; it could<br />\nalso provide a mechanism for the long and persistent<br />\ninvestigations needed to pierce the shroud. But with this as<br />\nwith any project the proof of the pudding is in the eating.<br />\nWe can only say good luck, and wait to see what the new<br />\ngroup can do.<br />\n<br />\nOpinion,<br />\n<br />\nGRAD STUDENTS, UNITE!<br />\nTwo years ago Johns Hopkins<br />\nUniversity celebrated the 100th<br />\nanniversary of its foundation as<br />\nthe first graduate school in<br />\nAmerica. Throughout 1975-6 the<br />\nUniversity administration<br />\nemphasized repeatedly the<br />\nachievements of graduate<br />\neducation. Ironically, the only<br />\norganized body of students to<br />\nplay a role in those celebrations<br />\nwas an organization representing<br />\nundergraduates\u2014the Student<br />\nCouncil.<br />\nGraduate students, who are<br />\nbeing trained for future roles as<br />\nleaders for the intellectual<br />\ncommunity, take no part in the<br />\ndecisions that shape their lives<br />\nhere and now in the Hopkins<br />\ncommunity. There exists no<br />\nuniversity-wide organization<br />\nwhich can give a voice to<br />\ngraduate students' interests.<br />\nGraduate students are parochially<br />\ndivided into their departments,<br />\nand even inside the majority of<br />\nthose have no forum through<br />\nwhich to express their opinions<br />\nor needs.<br />\nYet graduate students share<br />\nmany common interests<br />\nconcerning the most basic issues.<br />\nAll graduate students need a<br />\nminimum level of support that<br />\nwill allow them to teach and do<br />\nresearch. Stipends and salaries are<br />\nallocated to departments by<br />\npolicy determined entirely<br />\nbehind closed doors. The support<br />\ngiven the average student, as well<br />\nas the availability of low-cost<br />\nloans and other financial aid, has<br />\ndeclined sharply over the last ten<br />\nyears. Most graduate students,<br />\neven those who teach, are<br />\nsupported at a level far below<br />\nthat of other universities, and<br />\nbelow what they can possibly live<br />\non. At the same time, the ratio of<br />\ngraduates to undergraduates has<br />\nchanged from roughly l -to-1 to<br />\n1 -to-2, so that demands on<br />\ngraduate students to serve as<br />\nteachers have increased. Not only<br />\n<br />\ndo graduate students suffer, but<br />\nundergraduates do as well, for<br />\nthey cannot expect the quality of<br />\ntheir instruction to improve<br />\nwhen those who are asked to do<br />\na major part of the teaching lack<br />\nsufficient time because they must<br />\nalso take outside jobs.<br />\nMoney is by no means the<br />\nonly issue which affects all<br />\ngraduate students. University<br />\nhousing, and outside housing, are<br />\nin increasingly short supply while<br />\nrents rise sharply. Health<br />\ninsurance costs have spiraled.<br />\nLibrary conditions have<br />\nworsened while suitable study<br />\nand office space is virtually<br />\nunavailable. Access to books and<br />\nother working tools is often<br />\ndifficult. Women students<br />\nencounter obstacles in many<br />\nareas of university life. Most<br />\nimportant, graduate students are<br />\nnot represented on either<br />\ndepartmental or university levels<br />\nin the decisions on all these issues<br />\nthat shape their personal and<br />\nprofessional lives.<br />\nNot all graduate students are<br />\naffected equally by all of these<br />\nquestions. Others may have other<br />\nconcerns. But all graduate<br />\nstudents will continue to be<br />\nignored in the decision-making<br />\nprocesses long as they have no<br />\nmeans to make their views<br />\nknown to the University.<br />\nWhatever their concerns, they<br />\nwill remain unvoiced; they will<br />\nnot even be informed when<br />\ndecisions vital to their welfare are<br />\nto be made.<br />\nTo remedy this situation,<br />\ngraduate students began to work<br />\ntogether last spring to form a<br />\nuniversity -wide organization.<br />\nMore than 200 graduate students<br />\nattended meetings or expressed<br />\ninterest. A provisional council of<br />\nrepresentatives was formed,<br />\nrepresenting 24 of the 26<br />\ndepartments at Homewood, and<br />\nhas continued to work hard since<br />\nthat time. It has approved a draft<br />\nof a constitution for a Graduate<br />\n<br />\n(7<br />\n<br />\nRepresentative Organization<br />\nwhich will be presented for<br />\ndiscussion at a mass meeting<br />\nWednesday, September 13 at<br />\n5:00 in the Listening-Viewing<br />\nRoom.<br />\nThe provisional council has<br />\nnegotiated with the University to<br />\nobtain representatives<br />\non University committees and a<br />\nbudget for a graduate student<br />\norganization. It also organized<br />\nthe first University orientation<br />\nprogram for new graduate<br />\nstudents and will hold a free<br />\npicnic in Gilman quad this<br />\nSaturday afternoon for graduate<br />\nstudents from all departments.<br />\nAt the same time, committees on<br />\nnumerous issues have continued<br />\nto work, collecting information<br />\nand examining University<br />\npolicies.<br />\nWe believe all of these<br />\nactivities are vital to all graduate<br />\nstudents at Johns Hopkins. None<br />\nof our projects can be completed,<br />\nnor our hopes brought to<br />\nfruition, without the active<br />\nparticipation of large numbers of<br />\ngraduate students from all<br />\ndepartments. But by joining<br />\ntogether to establish a Graduate<br />\nRepresentative Organization,<br />\ngraduate students can begin to<br />\nplay the role that is their right in<br />\ndecisions affecting their lives.<br />\nThrough a Graduate<br />\nRepresentative Organization we<br />\ncan express and defend our<br />\ninterests, as well as develop a<br />\ncommunity that extends beyond<br />\ndepartment boundaries. We urge<br />\nall graduate students to takepart<br />\nin forming that community by<br />\ncoming to Saturday's picnic, and<br />\nwe urge you to help found the<br />\nGraduate Representative<br />\nOrganization in your<br />\ndepartments and at next<br />\nWednesday's open meeting.<br />\nThis opinion editorial was<br />\nprepared by the Provisional<br />\nCouncil of the Graduate<br />\nRepresentative Organization.<br />\n<br />\nr<br />\n<br />\n7<br />\n1<br />\n<br />\nLibrary Stiffs<br />\n<br />\n54<br />\n)<br />\n<br />\nsummer's fun MSEL/project was a confusing<br />\nrearrangemdnt of the D,level stacks. Again this year,<br />\nstudents and professors who were finally acquiring a feeble<br />\nsense of direction in the MSEL must now adapt to the inane<br />\njuggling of resources. The former Reference Room is now a<br />\nmap room sure to attract a paltry few. Gone are the<br />\ncomfortable chairs that were quite useful for informal<br />\nmeetings. A lack of furniture is also apparent in the new<br />\nreference area. Moreover, the dull roar of the Circulation<br />\nDesk and checkout areas will void any attempts at seroius<br />\nreference study.'<br />\n<br />\nstaff writers: Christy Jo Anderson, Roger Blumenthal,<br />\nPeter Cinquegrani, Gayle Cohen, Paul Cooper, Kevil<br />\nDuhon, Mark Fischer, Kevin Granville, Adam Gruen,<br />\nCarol Huber, Tim Hutchins, Mitch Hyman, Dan<br />\nKingsbury, Mike Myers, Chris Stutz.<br />\nphoto staff: Steffan Burns, John Gunn.<br />\nproduction staff:.

But what<br />\nabout people who don't have a<br />\nclass until 10 or 11, and don't<br />\nfeel like losing an hour or two of<br />\nsleep just to wait around at<br />\nLevering or in the Library? 'r<br />\nwhat if you're someone who<br />\nnever makes it anyplace until the<br />\nlast minute? For those of us vkho<br />\nare too sleepy and lazy to get<br />\nhere early in the morning, it is<br />\nindeed possible to find a parking<br />\nspace and walk to class in no<br />\nlonger than ten minutes every<br />\nday.All it takes is a rudimentary<br />\ntalent for parallel parking and a<br />\nlittle knowledge of where to<br />\nlook.<br />\nIt is most difficult to find a<br />\nparking place in the vicinity of<br />\nthe Homewood campus[ between<br />\n8:40 a.m. and 2:00 p.m. on<br />\nweekdays. During those hours,<br />\nevery space on campus isoccupied, with the exception of<br />\nthe metered areas and the back<br />\nlot on the other side of Wyman<br />\nPark Drive. Getting anywhere on<br />\ncampus from the back lot<br />\nrequires a long walk up a steep<br />\nhill. A convenient alternative is<br />\nto find a spot off-campus but<br />\nnear enough to the University<br />\nbuildings to be a short walk.<br />\nSince Homewood was divided<br />\ninto two disconnected parts by<br />\n<br />\nexecutive order a year ago, there<br />\nare two separate routes feasible<br />\nfor approaching the University;<br />\none in the north and one in the<br />\nsouth. In the north, the choicest<br />\nspots are in the 1 block East<br />\nUniversity Parkway, the first<br />\nblock on the other side of<br />\nCharles Street from Hopkins.<br />\nThere are no parking restrictions<br />\non either side, and the area is just<br />\na short distaance from the<br />\ndormitories, the library and<br />\nGilman Hall.<br />\nIf no space is open going from<br />\nSaint Paul Street northwest on<br />\nUniversity Parkway, cross Charles<br />\nStreet, then turn right on San<br />\nMartin Drive. Look for a space<br />\nalong University Parkway next to<br />\nthe baseball field, but these are<br />\nnot common on weekdays. San<br />\nMartin Drive, the first right off<br />\nUniversity Parkway, is<br />\nunrestricted on both sides.<br />\nSpaces can occasionally be found<br />\nthere. If not, turn at the first<br />\nstop onto Charles Street. Parking<br />\non southbound Charles isn't legal<br />\nuntil 10:00 a.m., which makes it<br />\nuseless unless your first class isn't<br />\nuntil 11:00, but if that's when<br />\nyour first class is, it's easy to get<br />\na space there and you can stay all<br />\nday. The northbound lane,<br />\nheaded away from campus, is<br />\ngood early in the morning and<br />\nthere usually are spaces. Just be<br />\ncertain to be gone by 3:00 p.m.,<br />\nor your car and your ticket will<br />\nboth be towed away.<br />\nEvery morning is different, but<br />\ngenerally a p'romising method is<br />\n<br />\narea not on campus is virtually<br />\nalways open, but it is a little<br />\nfarther away than the others<br />\nmentioned here. This is Saint<br />\nPaul Street, north of University<br />\nParkway.<br />\nIf you arrive on campus before<br />\n8:40 a.m., the simplest place to<br />\npark is in the large lot south of<br />\nGarland Hall. It is worth looking<br />\nfor a spot there until about 8:50,<br />\nwhen it is definitely full. If there<br />\nis nothing open after you get<br />\nthere, you still have several<br />\noptions.<br />\n<br />\nto turn south on Charles Street,<br />\nand then left onto University<br />\nParkway. Check that side for a<br />\ngood spot, and if one still fails to<br />\nmanifest itself, make a sharp<br />\nright onto Greenway. This is a<br />\none-way street with unmetered<br />\ntwo-hour ,parking.<br />\nEvery morning is different, but<br />\ngenerally a promising method is<br />\nto turn south on Charles Street,<br />\nand then left onto University<br />\nParkway. Check that side for a<br />\ngood spot, and if one still fails to<br />\nmanifest itself, make a sharp<br />\nright onto Greenway. This is a<br />\none-way street with unmetered<br />\ntwo-hour parking on both sides.<br />\nThis restriction is rarely if ever<br />\nenforced. It is almost always safe<br />\nto stay longer than two hours,<br />\neven all day. It's still illegal,<br />\nthough, so maybe one day<br />\nsomebody will get a ticket.<br />\nSpaces are usually available<br />\nalong Greenway, but if one fails<br />\nto appear, you can turn right on<br />\nthe access road next to Charles<br />\nStreet. This is another unmeteied<br />\ntwo-hour area.<br />\nThere are two other possible<br />\nplaces to park around the<br />\nnorthern half of campus. For<br />\nType II permit holders, it is<br />\nsometimes possible to find a<br />\nspace in the lot behind the<br />\nAthletic Center. The entrance is<br />\nlocated in back of the campus,<br />\noff the road which winds through<br />\nWyman Park, which makes it<br />\ninconvenient in case there isn't a<br />\nspot there.<br />\nIf worst comes to worst, one<br />\n<br />\nStarting from the road in front<br />\nof the News-Letter office, turn<br />\nright onto Art Museum Drive.<br />\nFrom there to the other side \u00b0I<br />\nthe Museum are several large<br />\nunmetered two-hour zones. Last<br />\nwinter one car parked there<br />\ncontinuously for at least three<br />\nweeks, during which a six-inch<br />\nlayer of snow sat undisturbed on<br />\ntop. No ticket was issued. These<br />\nspaces are especially tempting<br />\nbecause they are very ,close to<br />\ncampus buildings, particularly<br />\nShaffer Hall.<br />\n<br />\n11I-Level Reshuffled<br />\ncont. from p. 1<br />\nabolished. According to Ms.<br />\nBessie Hahn, Read& Services<br />\nLibrarian, more cuts may come<br />\nin the future.<br />\nNo decision has been made on<br />\nthe future use of the former Map<br />\nRoom locativn on A-level. One<br />\noption is to enlarge the already<br />\ncramped stack area of the<br />\nAudio-Visual Room. Ms. Hahn<br />\nnoted that more space would be<br />\nneeded because more materials<br />\nwould have to be put on<br />\nmicrofilm in the coming years<br />\ndue the physical deterioration of<br />\nmany paper documents. The<br />\nspace might also be used to hold<br />\nmore books. At present,<br />\noverflow from the library general<br />\nstacks is stored in the former<br />\nRowland Library in Gilman Hall.<br />\nThe bulletin boards displaced<br />\nby the card catalogs ,may be<br />\nrelocated in the cloak room<br />\n<br />\nbehind the telephone. Wall space<br />\nand shelf space are scarce in the<br />\nlibrary. Finally, the seating<br />\ncapacity of the Reserve Room<br />\nhas been enlarged by taking over<br />\nsome of the space vacated by the<br />\nold General Reference Room.<br />\n\u2022<br />\n<br />\nApartheid<br />\ncont. from. p.1<br />\nChaplain Cheser Wickwire and<br />\nBob Cheeks, of the Welfare<br />\nRights Organization.

Oh yeah, we need writers too. Any kind of<br />\nwriters, but especially ones with reefer.

Take, for<br />\ninstance, all the separate bits of technology which were<br />\nneeded just to bring me to my present state: there were<br />\nthe roaring engines of my Lear Jet, the silicone in my<br />\nbuxom secretary's mammary glands, and the chemical<br />\npreservatives in the plump grapes which she is even now<br />\ndropping into my eagerly-awaiting mouth. You, as college<br />\nstudents, must be prepared to meet the challenge of this<br />\nmost demanding era of history. It is you who must build<br />\nthe jet engines, swell the boobs and preserve the grapes of<br />\ntomorrow...no easy task. I assure you. Believe it or not,<br />\nwas once like you are--a scared, unsure, nauseatingly<br />\ninnocent freshman, but, through hard work and<br />\ndetermination, and of course the invaluable help of Johns<br />\nHopkins, I managed to find a gravy train that puts even<br />\nthe GSA to shame. If General Burritos wasn't waiting for<br />\nme on the first tee I'd be glad to tell you all about it, but<br />\ntime does not permit. Good luck, young Hoppie, my<br />\nthoughts are with you!<br />\n<br />\nA Message<br />\nFrom The<br />\nDean<br />\nAt ease. Now I know that a lot of you people come to<br />\nHopkins with your heads full of big ideas about how<br />\nthings are gonna be. You probably drooled all over your<br />\npopcorn during<br />\nAnimal House in panting anticipation<br />\nof all the free beer, free love, and expensive drugs that<br />\nyou were going to indulge in during your four-year stint<br />\nat Homewood. Well, you just better forget that shit right<br />\nnow, and I mean pronto, pizzaface! Your parents are<br />\nshelling out a lot of good, hard-earned dough to send you<br />\nhere, and my job is to see that it doesn't all get wasted<br />\nsupporting cocaine dealers and prophylactic<br />\nmanufacturers. I kissed a lot of ass to get this job and if<br />\nyou think I'm gonna let a bunch of spoiled would-be<br />\nintellectuals make me look bad, then you've got quite<br />\nanother think coming. One screw-up, just one, and you<br />\ncan kiss Med School goodbye along with whatever's left of<br />\nyour backside when I get through with it. We have only<br />\none rule here: Obey the rules! Obey that and we'll get<br />\nalong. Ignore it and I'll rip your liver out, I swear. Thank<br />\nyou for your cooperation.<br />\n<br />\nOrganizations<br />\nStudent Union<br />\nThe Hopkins Student Union, local 433, was formed in<br />\n1931 to insure the student body a decent living wage and a<br />\nstable place in the American dream.

The comedy in Sleeper is physical, and in<br />\nLove and Death which followed, it is verbal. But on the<br />\nperiphery of these comedies, there is a feeling of drama<br />\nfor the first time. The films are no longer merely a vehicle<br />\nfor Allen's humor; they have become an expression of<br />\nAllen's art as a director. The visual style has much greater<br />\nimportance in his films, and this results in a more total<br />\nfilm.<br />\nThe technique used in these two films was synthesized<br />\nto create Annie Hall, which is truly a comic masterpiece.<br />\nThe verbal and physical comedy has been integrated, and<br />\nthe drama which was on the sideline enters the picture.<br />\nThe balance is perfect, and the visual style of Annie Hall<br />\nbecomes as important as the story. Thus it is a very<br />\npivotal film in Allen's career, considering the nature of his<br />\nlatest film, Interiors. This film is pure drama with Allen<br />\nonly as writer-director, not as actor or comedian. The<br />\ncomedy is only on the periphery, but never in the film.<br />\ntalents that<br />\nInteriors exhibits Allen's great directorial<br />\nhad been present, but overshadowed, in his later<br />\ncomedies. As a result, it seems apparent that Woody Allen<br />\nis not only America's greatest comic, but also its<br />\ngreatest director.<br />\n<br />\nfourteen years ago, and although the sound is occasionally<br />\nfamiliar, the results are not as great as before. The<br />\ncompositions on the album could be called sexist; they<br />\nare a rather degrading exploration of \"some girls.\" The<br />\nmusic is less exploitive, though, and more erotic and<br />\nperversely sensual. Mick Jagger's voice is in good form,<br />\nand it creates a certain mystique surrounding the<br />\nsexuality that pervades the album. The sound is not<br />\nimitative of the past as it integrates a wide variety of<br />\nmusical styles. There is everything from the upbeat disco<br />\nof \"Miss You\" to the country-western sound of<br />\n\"Far-Away Eyes,\" and there is some excellent rock and<br />\nroll in songs such as \"When the Whip Comes Down\" and<br />\n\"Before They Make Me Run.\" The main themes are girls<br />\nand New York City, but the ideas and lyrics are in way<br />\nrepetitive. The songs are pessimistic as they describe the<br />\nwily ways of different types of girls, and the images of<br />\nNew York accentuate the feeling of isolation and<br />\nloneliness. The Stones have always been fascinated by<br />\ngirls, but the collection they have assembled on the new<br />\nalbum is impressive. It's good to have a new Stones album<br />\nafter such a long wait--and Some Girls is a good<br />\nalbum--but it cannot compare with their great albums of<br />\nthe past.<br />\n<br />\nHere, Poison Is<br />\nPure Pleasure<br />\nBY ROS RESNICK<br />\nArsenic and Old Lace, Hopkins' premiere student<br />\nproduction, opened the season with zany humor and<br />\ndelightful death. Although parts of the play were out,of<br />\nsynch, its excellent acting and irony made the production<br />\nvery enjoyable.<br />\nJoseph Kesselreig's play, produced here by Writing<br />\nSeminars professor Robert Arellano, concerns the<br />\neccentric Brewster family, whose members demonstrate<br />\ntheir individuality in deadly ways. Two spinster sisters,<br />\nAbby and Martha, take pity on twelve elderly<br />\n\"gentlemen\" by lulling them to the Big Sleep with<br />\nelderberry wine. Their nephew, who thinks he's Teddy<br />\nRoosevelt, joyfully buries what he thinks are malaria<br />\nvictim; in the locks of the Panama Canal. Later on in the<br />\nplay, another nephew turns out to be a wanted murderer<br />\nand competes with his aunts in the \"most victims\"<br />\ncontest.<br />\nChris Stutz (Abby) steals the show with her matronly<br />\ndelicacy and gossipy giggle. One of the play's funniest<br />\nscenes occurs when Abby and Martha shamelessly tell<br />\ntheir only normal nephew about their little secret. Joanna<br />\nShwartz (Martha), who replaced Celeste Yousoof in the<br />\nThursday production, deserves much credit for her quick<br />\nmemorization and ease in playing second fiddle to Chris.<br />\nRick Vaum (Jonathan) must be the most sinister presence<br />\nto hit the stage since Boris Karloff. Robert Anthenelli<br />\n(Mortimer) succeeds as the fidgety, but not homicidal,<br />\nnephew and drama critic.<br />\nSet in Brooklyn, Arsenic and Old Lace demands long<br />\nhours of practicing accents. Ruth Bosch (Officer O'Hara)<br />\ncharms with her flawless Irish brogue and Basil Zaharias<br />\n(Officer Klein) does a Brooklyn accent that even the<br />\nLords of Flatbush would consider cool. Mark Wolkow<br />\n(Mr. Gibbs) is also full of other witty tidbits such as the<br />\ncontinual stream of jibes against play reviewers. As the<br />\nultimate insult, Mortimer's girlfriend yells after him,<br />\n\"You critic!\"<br />\nArsenic and Old Lace is playing in the<br />\nListening/Viewing Room on September 8 and 9 at 7:30<br />\nP.M.<br />\n<br />\n\fNEWS-LETTER / PAGE 13<br />\n<br />\nYour chance to make<br />\na difference!<br />\n<br />\nDon't be ignorant.

There are the<br />\nbig sports like lacrosse and<br />\nswimming, in both of which we<br />\nhold national championships, as<br />\nwell as smaller ones in which the<br />\neffort and desire are just as great<br />\nif not greater. For those less<br />\nwilling or able to devote their<br />\ntime and \u2022effort to sports, there<br />\nare a wide range of intramural<br />\nathletics.<br />\nThere is another component of<br />\nsports that tends to be belittled<br />\nin these \"do-it-yourself\" times,<br />\nand that is the role of the<br />\nspectator. In the professional<br />\narena, the main function of the<br />\nspectator is simple and readily<br />\napparent: no fans = no money =<br />\nno team. But on the collegiate<br />\nlevel, it becomes a much<br />\ndifferent story. in the strictly<br />\nfinancial sense, a collegiate team<br />\ncan exist as long as there are<br />\ninterested players, a coach, and<br />\nfinancial support from the<br />\nathletic department. In other<br />\nwords, a collegiate team can<br />\nsurvive financially without the<br />\n<br />\nsupport of the fans. The<br />\nimportance of the collegiate fan<br />\nshifts from economic to moral.<br />\nAthletes can play for a team and {<br />\nfor themselves, but they actually<br />\nplay for an institution as its '<br />\nrepresentatives. There has to be a<br />\ngive-and-take relationship<br />\nbetween he team and the fans,<br />\nand empty seats, brick walls, and<br />\nfence posts do not chant and<br />\n<br />\ncheer too well. The fans have a<br />\njob to do and the responsibility<br />\nto fulfill it because they owe<br />\nsome support to all those men<br />\nand women out there busting<br />\ntheir butts for old JHU. Ft's<br />\npretty hard to keep at your best<br />\nconsistently without a little<br />\noutside help. A complete sports<br />\nprogram needs fans just as much<br />\nas it needs athletes, coaches, and<br />\n<br />\nequipment. I am not asking you<br />\nto root for the team no matter<br />\nwhat.

Theoretically, the<br />\nrepaid money will be lent to<br />\nmore needy students. When<br />\ndefaults occur,Congress has the<br />\noption of injecting more funds<br />\ninto the system.

The academic challenge at this<br />\nUniversity presents something new and different for every<br />\nfreshman; yet, it is not the most valuable part of being a<br />\nstudent here. Everyone has had classes before, in prep or<br />\nhigh school and before that in grammar school. Many will<br />\ngo on to still more classes in other institutions after leaving<br />\nHopkins. Through an academic program here, a person can<br />\nlearn a great deal, grow intellectually, and prepare for a<br />\ncareer later in life. But by themselves, classes are not the<br />\nrichest part of being a student at Johns Hopkins.<br />\nThe total life experience available to an undergraduate<br />\nenrolled at this University is of tremendous value. It is a<br />\nfairy-tale method for passing from the adolescent to the<br />\nadult world. A student can arrange his life any way he<br />\nchooses; yet he is still protected in some ways by a guardian<br />\nangel, the University. People who circulate about<br />\nHomewood are nothing if not diverse; birds of all kinds find<br />\nthemselves Blue Jays. You might come across an expert<br />\nchess player or scuba diver, or somebody who has been to<br />\nTogo and back. You will definitely come across somebody<br />\nwho can wiggle a webbed stick. The male-female student<br />\nratio is lamentable, but still the social scene at Hopkins<br />\noffers great potential for stimulation.<br />\nRegrettably, a considerable number of undergraduates at<br />\nthis University consider their present occupation as simply a<br />\nmeans to an end. No matter how successfully they may<br />\npursue their goals, they waste their time here. The JHU<br />\nexperience can and should be fulfilling in itself...<br />\nSo relax and enjoy your stay at Johns Hopkins--it's a part<br />\nof your life that you will only have once.<br /><br />\nGood Luck, GRO<br />\nGraduate students form an unusually large and active<br />\npart of the Hopkins community. Thus, the recent move to<br />\nestablish an organization to represent them here comes as a<br />\nwelcome break I from the customary philosophy of<br />\nindependent dealings within each department. The potential<br />\nfor unity among grads in all fields stands out as a promising<br />\nfeature of the proposed group.<br />\nAn effective organization could obtain tangible benefits<br />\nfor its constituents. Financial dealings between the<br />\nacademic departments and their graduate students, like too<br />\nmuch of what occurs in faculty circles, have<br />\ntraditionally been shrouded in secrecy. This situation is<br />\nagainst the interests of most grads, since they have .no real<br />\nway of knowing how much stipend students have received<br />\nin the vast and in other departments. An active G.R.O.<br />\ncould notionly articulate graduate student needs; it could<br />\nalso provide a mechanism for the long and persistent<br />\ninvestigations needed to pierce the shroud. But with this as<br />\nwith any project the proof of the pudding is in the eating.<br />\nWe can only say good luck, and wait to see what the new<br />\ngroup can do.<br /><br />\nOpinion,<br /><br />\nGRAD STUDENTS, UNITE!<br />\nTwo years ago Johns Hopkins<br />\nUniversity celebrated the 100th<br />\nanniversary of its foundation as<br />\nthe first graduate school in<br />\nAmerica. Throughout 1975-6 the<br />\nUniversity administration<br />\nemphasized repeatedly the<br />\nachievements of graduate<br />\neducation. Ironically, the only<br />\norganized body of students to<br />\nplay a role in those celebrations<br />\nwas an organization representing<br />\nundergraduates\u2014the Student<br />\nCouncil.<br />\nGraduate students, who are<br />\nbeing trained for future roles as<br />\nleaders for the intellectual<br />\ncommunity, take no part in the<br />\ndecisions that shape their lives<br />\nhere and now in the Hopkins<br />\ncommunity. There exists no<br />\nuniversity-wide organization<br />\nwhich can give a voice to<br />\ngraduate students' interests.<br />\nGraduate students are parochially<br />\ndivided into their departments,<br />\nand even inside the majority of<br />\nthose have no forum through<br />\nwhich to express their opinions<br />\nor needs.<br />\nYet graduate students share<br />\nmany common interests<br />\nconcerning the most basic issues.<br />\nAll graduate students need a<br />\nminimum level of support that<br />\nwill allow them to teach and do<br />\nresearch. Stipends and salaries are<br />\nallocated to departments by<br />\npolicy determined entirely<br />\nbehind closed doors. The support<br />\ngiven the average student, as well<br />\nas the availability of low-cost<br />\nloans and other financial aid, has<br />\ndeclined sharply over the last ten<br />\nyears. Most graduate students,<br />\neven those who teach, are<br />\nsupported at a level far below<br />\nthat of other universities, and<br />\nbelow what they can possibly live<br />\non. At the same time, the ratio of<br />\ngraduates to undergraduates has<br />\nchanged from roughly l -to-1 to<br />\n1 -to-2, so that demands on<br />\ngraduate students to serve as<br />\nteachers have increased. Not only<br /><br />\ndo graduate students suffer, but<br />\nundergraduates do as well, for<br />\nthey cannot expect the quality of<br />\ntheir instruction to improve<br />\nwhen those who are asked to do<br />\na major part of the teaching lack<br />\nsufficient time because they must<br />\nalso take outside jobs.<br />\nMoney is by no means the<br />\nonly issue which affects all<br />\ngraduate students. University<br />\nhousing, and outside housing, are<br />\nin increasingly short supply while<br />\nrents rise sharply. Health<br />\ninsurance costs have spiraled.<br />\nLibrary conditions have<br />\nworsened while suitable study<br />\nand office space is virtually<br />\nunavailable. Access to books and<br />\nother working tools is often<br />\ndifficult. Women students<br />\nencounter obstacles in many<br />\nareas of university life. Most<br />\nimportant, graduate students are<br />\nnot represented on either<br />\ndepartmental or university levels<br />\nin the decisions on all these issues<br />\nthat shape their personal and<br />\nprofessional lives.<br />\nNot all graduate students are<br />\naffected equally by all of these<br />\nquestions. Others may have other<br />\nconcerns. But all graduate<br />\nstudents will continue to be<br />\nignored in the decision-making<br />\nprocesses long as they have no<br />\nmeans to make their views<br />\nknown to the University.<br />\nWhatever their concerns, they<br />\nwill remain unvoiced; they will<br />\nnot even be informed when<br />\ndecisions vital to their welfare are<br />\nto be made.<br />\nTo remedy this situation,<br />\ngraduate students began to work<br />\ntogether last spring to form a<br />\nuniversity -wide organization.<br />\nMore than 200 graduate students<br />\nattended meetings or expressed<br />\ninterest. A provisional council of<br />\nrepresentatives was formed,<br />\nrepresenting 24 of the 26<br />\ndepartments at Homewood, and<br />\nhas continued to work hard since<br />\nthat time. It has approved a draft<br />\nof a constitution for a Graduate<br /><br />\n(7<br /><br />\nRepresentative Organization<br />\nwhich will be presented for<br />\ndiscussion at a mass meeting<br />\nWednesday, September 13 at<br />\n5:00 in the Listening-Viewing<br />\nRoom.<br />\nThe provisional council has<br />\nnegotiated with the University to<br />\nobtain representatives<br />\non University committees and a<br />\nbudget for a graduate student<br />\norganization. It also organized<br />\nthe first University orientation<br />\nprogram for new graduate<br />\nstudents and will hold a free<br />\npicnic in Gilman quad this<br />\nSaturday afternoon for graduate<br />\nstudents from all departments.<br />\nAt the same time, committees on<br />\nnumerous issues have continued<br />\nto work, collecting information<br />\nand examining University<br />\npolicies.<br />\nWe believe all of these<br />\nactivities are vital to all graduate<br />\nstudents at Johns Hopkins. None<br />\nof our projects can be completed,<br />\nnor our hopes brought to<br />\nfruition, without the active<br />\nparticipation of large numbers of<br />\ngraduate students from all<br />\ndepartments. But by joining<br />\ntogether to establish a Graduate<br />\nRepresentative Organization,<br />\ngraduate students can begin to<br />\nplay the role that is their right in<br />\ndecisions affecting their lives.<br />\nThrough a Graduate<br />\nRepresentative Organization we<br />\ncan express and defend our<br />\ninterests, as well as develop a<br />\ncommunity that extends beyond<br />\ndepartment boundaries. We urge<br />\nall graduate students to takepart<br />\nin forming that community by<br />\ncoming to Saturday's picnic, and<br />\nwe urge you to help found the<br />\nGraduate Representative<br />\nOrganization in your<br />\ndepartments and at next<br />\nWednesday's open meeting.<br />\nThis opinion editorial was<br />\nprepared by the Provisional<br />\nCouncil of the Graduate<br />\nRepresentative Organization.<br /><br />\nr<br /><br />\n7<br />\n1<br /><br />\nLibrary Stiffs<br /><br />\n54<br />\n)<br /><br />\nsummer's fun MSEL/project was a confusing<br />\nrearrangemdnt of the D,level stacks. Again this year,<br />\nstudents and professors who were finally acquiring a feeble<br />\nsense of direction in the MSEL must now adapt to the inane<br />\njuggling of resources.

But what<br />\nabout people who don't have a<br />\nclass until 10 or 11, and don't<br />\nfeel like losing an hour or two of<br />\nsleep just to wait around at<br />\nLevering or in the Library? 'r<br />\nwhat if you're someone who<br />\nnever makes it anyplace until the<br />\nlast minute? For those of us vkho<br />\nare too sleepy and lazy to get<br />\nhere early in the morning, it is<br />\nindeed possible to find a parking<br />\nspace and walk to class in no<br />\nlonger than ten minutes every<br />\nday.All it takes is a rudimentary<br />\ntalent for parallel parking and a<br />\nlittle knowledge of where to<br />\nlook.<br />\nIt is most difficult to find a<br />\nparking place in the vicinity of<br />\nthe Homewood campus[ between<br />\n8:40 a.m. and 2:00 p.m. on<br />\nweekdays. During those hours,<br />\nevery space on campus isoccupied, with the exception of<br />\nthe metered areas and the back<br />\nlot on the other side of Wyman<br />\nPark Drive. Getting anywhere on<br />\ncampus from the back lot<br />\nrequires a long walk up a steep<br />\nhill. A convenient alternative is<br />\nto find a spot off-campus but<br />\nnear enough to the University<br />\nbuildings to be a short walk.<br />\nSince Homewood was divided<br />\ninto two disconnected parts by<br /><br />\nexecutive order a year ago, there<br />\nare two separate routes feasible<br />\nfor approaching the University;<br />\none in the north and one in the<br />\nsouth. In the north, the choicest<br />\nspots are in the 1 block East<br />\nUniversity Parkway, the first<br />\nblock on the other side of<br />\nCharles Street from Hopkins.<br />\nThere are no parking restrictions<br />\non either side, and the area is just<br />\na short distaance from the<br />\ndormitories, the library and<br />\nGilman Hall.<br />\nIf no space is open going from<br />\nSaint Paul Street northwest on<br />\nUniversity Parkway, cross Charles<br />\nStreet, then turn right on San<br />\nMartin Drive. Look for a space<br />\nalong University Parkway next to<br />\nthe baseball field, but these are<br />\nnot common on weekdays. San<br />\nMartin Drive, the first right off<br />\nUniversity Parkway, is<br />\nunrestricted on both sides.<br />\nSpaces can occasionally be found<br />\nthere. If not, turn at the first<br />\nstop onto Charles Street. Parking<br />\non southbound Charles isn't legal<br />\nuntil 10:00 a.m., which makes it<br />\nuseless unless your first class isn't<br />\nuntil 11:00, but if that's when<br />\nyour first class is, it's easy to get<br />\na space there and you can stay all<br />\nday. The northbound lane,<br />\nheaded away from campus, is<br />\ngood early in the morning and<br />\nthere usually are spaces. Just be<br />\ncertain to be gone by 3:00 p.m.,<br />\nor your car and your ticket will<br />\nboth be towed away.<br />\nEvery morning is different, but<br />\ngenerally a p'romising method is<br /><br />\narea not on campus is virtually<br />\nalways open, but it is a little<br />\nfarther away than the others<br />\nmentioned here. This is Saint<br />\nPaul Street, north of University<br />\nParkway.<br />\nIf you arrive on campus before<br />\n8:40 a.m., the simplest place to<br />\npark is in the large lot south of<br />\nGarland Hall. It is worth looking<br />\nfor a spot there until about 8:50,<br />\nwhen it is definitely full. If there<br />\nis nothing open after you get<br />\nthere, you still have several<br />\noptions.<br /><br />\nto turn south on Charles Street,<br />\nand then left onto University<br />\nParkway. Check that side for a<br />\ngood spot, and if one still fails to<br />\nmanifest itself, make a sharp<br />\nright onto Greenway. This is a<br />\none-way street with unmetered<br />\ntwo-hour ,parking.<br />\nEvery morning is different, but<br />\ngenerally a promising method is<br />\nto turn south on Charles Street,<br />\nand then left onto University<br />\nParkway. Check that side for a<br />\ngood spot, and if one still fails to<br />\nmanifest itself, make a sharp<br />\nright onto Greenway. This is a<br />\none-way street with unmetered<br />\ntwo-hour parking on both sides.<br />\nThis restriction is rarely if ever<br />\nenforced. It is almost always safe<br />\nto stay longer than two hours,<br />\neven all day. It's still illegal,<br />\nthough, so maybe one day<br />\nsomebody will get a ticket.<br />\nSpaces are usually available<br />\nalong Greenway, but if one fails<br />\nto appear, you can turn right on<br />\nthe access road next to Charles<br />\nStreet. This is another unmeteied<br />\ntwo-hour area.<br />\nThere are two other possible<br />\nplaces to park around the<br />\nnorthern half of campus. For<br />\nType II permit holders, it is<br />\nsometimes possible to find a<br />\nspace in the lot behind the<br />\nAthletic Center. The entrance is<br />\nlocated in back of the campus,<br />\noff the road which winds through<br />\nWyman Park, which makes it<br />\ninconvenient in case there isn't a<br />\nspot there.<br />\nIf worst comes to worst, one<br /><br />\nStarting from the road in front<br />\nof the News-Letter office, turn<br />\nright onto Art Museum Drive.<br />\nFrom there to the other side \u00b0I<br />\nthe Museum are several large<br />\nunmetered two-hour zones. Last<br />\nwinter one car parked there<br />\ncontinuously for at least three<br />\nweeks, during which a six-inch<br />\nlayer of snow sat undisturbed on<br />\ntop. No ticket was issued. These<br />\nspaces are especially tempting<br />\nbecause they are very ,close to<br />\ncampus buildings, particularly<br />\nShaffer Hall.<br /><br />\n11I-Level Reshuffled<br />\ncont. from p. 1<br />\nabolished. According to Ms.<br />\nBessie Hahn, Read&amp; Services<br />\nLibrarian, more cuts may come<br />\nin the future.<br />\nNo decision has been made on<br />\nthe future use of the former Map<br />\nRoom locativn on A-level. One<br />\noption is to enlarge the already<br />\ncramped stack area of the<br />\nAudio-Visual Room. Ms. Hahn<br />\nnoted that more space would be<br />\nneeded because more materials<br />\nwould have to be put on<br />\nmicrofilm in the coming years<br />\ndue the physical deterioration of<br />\nmany paper documents. The<br />\nspace might also be used to hold<br />\nmore books. At present,<br />\noverflow from the library general<br />\nstacks is stored in the former<br />\nRowland Library in Gilman Hall.<br />\nThe bulletin boards displaced<br />\nby the card catalogs ,may be<br />\nrelocated in the cloak room<br /><br />\nbehind the telephone. Wall space<br />\nand shelf space are scarce in the<br />\nlibrary. Finally, the seating<br />\ncapacity of the Reserve Room<br />\nhas been enlarged by taking over<br />\nsome of the space vacated by the<br />\nold General Reference Room.<br />\n\u2022<br /><br />\nApartheid<br />\ncont. from. p.1<br />\nChaplain Cheser Wickwire and<br />\nBob Cheeks, of the Welfare<br />\nRights Organization.

You, as college<br />\nstudents, must be prepared to meet the challenge of this<br />\nmost demanding era of history.

This week's films display his matured and<br />\ndeveloped comic technique and a directorial eye that is<br />\namong the best of any American filmmaker's today.<br />\nSleeper is about life 200 years in the future. Allen, a<br />\n20th-century Rip van Winkle, wakes in this new era and<br />\nencounters everything from robot butlers to crazed<br />\nrevolutionaries still trying to overthrow the government.<br />\nAnnie Hall is a \"nervous romance,\" somewhat<br /><br />\nKeaton and Allen<br /><br />\nautobiographical, about Allen's relationships with women,<br />\nespecially Diane Keaton, who won Best Actress for her<br />\nperformance in the film.<br />\nThe comic technique in his earlier films was rather<br />\ncorny, and occasionally stupid. The plot was good, but<br />\noften seemed dictated by his attempt to make a joke.<br />\nThese jokes were puns and one-liners that came after a<br />\nseries of developments that led to the punch line. Allen<br />\n.was a stand-upcomedian before turning to film, and Play<br />\nIt Again Sam and Take the Money and Run often seem<br />\nlike a stand-up routine on film with a plot weaving in and<br />\nout of the humor.<br />\nThe technique in his later films is much more<br />\nsophisticated. The comedy in Sleeper is physical, and in<br />\nLove and Death which followed, it is verbal. But on the<br />\nperiphery of these comedies, there is a feeling of drama<br />\nfor the first time. The films are no longer merely a vehicle<br />\nfor Allen's humor; they have become an expression of<br />\nAllen's art as a director. The visual style has much greater<br />\nimportance in his films, and this results in a more total<br />\nfilm.<br />\nThe technique used in these two films was synthesized<br />\nto create Annie Hall, which is truly a comic masterpiece.<br />\nThe verbal and physical comedy has been integrated, and<br />\nthe drama which was on the sideline enters the picture.<br />\nThe balance is perfect, and the visual style of Annie Hall<br />\nbecomes as important as the story. Thus it is a very<br />\npivotal film in Allen's career, considering the nature of his<br />\nlatest film, Interiors. This film is pure drama with Allen<br />\nonly as writer-director, not as actor or comedian. The<br />\ncomedy is only on the periphery, but never in the film.<br />\ntalents that<br />\nInteriors exhibits Allen's great directorial<br />\nhad been present, but overshadowed, in his later<br />\ncomedies. As a result, it seems apparent that Woody Allen<br />\nis not only America's greatest comic, but also its<br />\ngreatest director.<br /><br />\nfourteen years ago, and although the sound is occasionally<br />\nfamiliar, the results are not as great as before. The<br />\ncompositions on the album could be called sexist; they<br />\nare a rather degrading exploration of \"some girls.\" The<br />\nmusic is less exploitive, though, and more erotic and<br />\nperversely sensual. Mick Jagger's voice is in good form,<br />\nand it creates a certain mystique surrounding the<br />\nsexuality that pervades the album. The sound is not<br />\nimitative of the past as it integrates a wide variety of<br />\nmusical styles. There is everything from the upbeat disco<br />\nof \"Miss You\" to the country-western sound of<br />\n\"Far-Away Eyes,\" and there is some excellent rock and<br />\nroll in songs such as \"When the Whip Comes Down\" and<br />\n\"Before They Make Me Run.\" The main themes are girls<br />\nand New York City, but the ideas and lyrics are in way<br />\nrepetitive. The songs are pessimistic as they describe the<br />\nwily ways of different types of girls, and the images of<br />\nNew York accentuate the feeling of isolation and<br />\nloneliness. The Stones have always been fascinated by<br />\ngirls, but the collection they have assembled on the new<br />\nalbum is impressive. It's good to have a new Stones album<br />\nafter such a long wait--and Some Girls is a good<br />\nalbum--but it cannot compare with their great albums of<br />\nthe past.<br /><br />\nHere, Poison Is<br />\nPure Pleasure<br />\nBY ROS RESNICK<br />\nArsenic and Old Lace, Hopkins' premiere student<br />\nproduction, opened the season with zany humor and<br />\ndelightful death. Although parts of the play were out,of<br />\nsynch, its excellent acting and irony made the production<br />\nvery enjoyable.<br />\nJoseph Kesselreig's play, produced here by Writing<br />\nSeminars professor Robert Arellano, concerns the<br />\neccentric Brewster family, whose members demonstrate<br />\ntheir individuality in deadly ways. Two spinster sisters,<br />\nAbby and Martha, take pity on twelve elderly<br />\n\"gentlemen\" by lulling them to the Big Sleep with<br />\nelderberry wine. Their nephew, who thinks he's Teddy<br />\nRoosevelt, joyfully buries what he thinks are malaria<br />\nvictim; in the locks of the Panama Canal. Later on in the<br />\nplay, another nephew turns out to be a wanted murderer<br />\nand competes with his aunts in the \"most victims\"<br />\ncontest.<br />\nChris Stutz (Abby) steals the show with her matronly<br />\ndelicacy and gossipy giggle. One of the play's funniest<br />\nscenes occurs when Abby and Martha shamelessly tell<br />\ntheir only normal nephew about their little secret. Joanna<br />\nShwartz (Martha), who replaced Celeste Yousoof in the<br />\nThursday production, deserves much credit for her quick<br />\nmemorization and ease in playing second fiddle to Chris.<br />\nRick Vaum (Jonathan) must be the most sinister presence<br />\nto hit the stage since Boris Karloff.

In the professional<br />\narena, the main function of the<br />\nspectator is simple and readily<br />\napparent: no fans = no money =<br />\nno team. But on the collegiate<br />\nlevel, it becomes a much<br />\ndifferent story. in the strictly<br />\nfinancial sense, a collegiate team<br />\ncan exist as long as there are<br />\ninterested players, a coach, and<br />\nfinancial support from the<br />\nathletic department. In other<br />\nwords, a collegiate team can<br />\nsurvive financially without the<br /><br />\nsupport of the fans.
