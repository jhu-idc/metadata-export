However, from whatVI e understand of the matter, wa believe that the action was a wise one. At least the new idea<br />\nis worth a trial.<br />\nThe truth of the matter is, that for the<br />\nlast two or three years, trial for places has<br />\nWith an unlimited<br />\nbeen made too easy.<br />\nnumber of places open, men have been able<br />\nto make these places with almost no difficulty, until the idea naturally developed<br />\namong the students, that to be a member of<br />\nthe clubs was no great honor. Consequently<br />\nattendance at rehearsals became more and<br />\nmore indifferent, while members began to<br />\nparticipate in only such concerts that promised a considerable amount of \"fun.\" To<br />\nsuch an extent was this true that the management was often placed in an embarassing,<br />\nif not dishonorable light, before its patrons.<br />\nWhen concerts are arranged with societies,<br />\nit is necessary for the management to specify<br />\nthe number of men to take part. Frequently<br />\nas with the Christmas trip this year, only<br />\nhalf the specified number seemed to feel in<br />\nany way bound to appear. Consequently<br />\ntwo concerts of the tour had to be canceled.<br />\n<br />\nM<br />\n<br />\nUnder the new arrangement, by limiting<br />\nthe Glee Club to Eighteen men, it is thought<br />\nthat competition will be created for a place<br />\non the club and that better results will be<br />\nobtained.<br />\nGAIN we take occasion to congratulate<br />\nthe Dance Committee on the arrangements at the last dance. The arrangements last Friday evening, we think,<br />\nwere possibly even superior to those at the<br />\nfirst dance. Certainly the change in the<br />\nstyle of the programme was an improvement,<br />\nand the addition of coffee to the supper menu<br />\nwas a happy one.<br />\nIt should be gratifying to the committee<br />\nto recall the splendid attendance, when it<br />\nis remembered that on that same evening the<br />\nThe latter is<br />\n\"Fridays\" gave a dance.<br />\npopular among the younger set, but it was<br />\nnoticeable that many of the couples that<br />\n.danced in McCoy Hall are either members<br />\nof, or usually attend the \"Fridays.\"<br />\nConsidering this growing popularity of<br />\nthe Hopkins cotillions under the present<br />\nmanagement, we think that the chaperones<br />\nshould feel more than ever called upon to<br />\nlend their charming presence at the dances.<br />\nIndeed, had it not been for the two of the<br />\ntwenty-two selected matrons who were present on last Friday evening, the condition<br />\nwould have been a most embarassing one,<br />\n<br />\nA<br />\n<br />\n\f2<br />\n<br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\n<br />\nT seems, that, despite the general criticism expressed among the students of<br />\nthe University regarding the disgraceof care given to the Trophy Room,<br />\nlack<br />\nful<br />\nno steps whatever are being taken to remedy<br />\nthe evil. The matter has become so pressing that it demands the immediate and special attention of the Athletic Association.<br />\nThe banners and pennants\u2014which, from<br />\ntheir associations with hard-won contests,<br />\nand their material expression of a proud athletic record, should be handled with respect<br />\n\u2014are slapped against the wall with no more<br />\nconsideration than were they valued only for<br />\nthe cloth that is in them. Absolutely no<br />\nthought seems to be given as to whether they<br />\nare hung in the right places, or at what<br />\nangle they point; and indeed visitors are<br />\noften compelled to express amused wonder<br />\nto find the trophy of one victory hanging<br />\non top of that of another.<br />\nWhen attempts are made to find the reasons for such a condition, the blame is conveniently shifted from one shoulder to another with all the blandness of Chinese<br />\ndiplomacy. Men in the Athletic Association,<br />\nwho, by virtue of their high positions, should<br />\nconsider themselves responsible for the management of the Association, and a consequent shame for the existing condition, insist that the fault is with the \"Dance\" committee, protesting that since the latter<br />\ndraws upon the Trophy Room for<br />\ndecorations, it is the latter's business to see<br />\nthat the banners, etc., are returned to their<br />\nproper places. Such an explanation may be<br />\nsatisfactory to those who hide behind it, but<br />\nit certainly discloses a woeful absence of<br />\nsystematic administration.<br />\nIt is within the power of the Association<br />\nto say by whom these trophies may be used,<br />\nand upon what conditions. If these conditions are not observed, it is the business<br />\nof the Association to revoke the privilege.<br />\n<br />\nI<br />\n<br />\nThe American Economic Convention which<br />\nwas recently held at this University afforded<br />\nan excellent example of the shortcomings of<br />\nthe English language. Dr. Hollander in his<br />\npaper, \"The Present State of the Theory of<br />\nDistribution,\" made an earnest appeal that<br />\n<br />\nmore political enonomists devote themselves<br />\nto a thorough study of present conditions<br />\ninstead of spending so much time in theorizing. \"It is much easier,\" said Dr. Hollander,\"'to spin cob-webs in a closet,' than<br />\nto get down to real work, and the remedy<br />\nlay in 'theorization through facts.'\" At<br />\nthe close of his address, a number of distinguished economists eagerly struggled for the<br />\nright to tell the audience that they were immensely surprised to find that Dr. Hollander<br />\nwas so diametrically opposed to all theorization, and mis-spent a great deal of energy in<br />\nproving the value of good theorization\u2014as<br />\na matter of fact just what Dr. Hollander had<br />\nbeen advocating. Truly, when the English<br />\nlanguage when carefully used can be so easily misunderstood even by the most aeute<br />\nminds, how can we ever be sure of presenting our views so that they may be invariably<br />\nintelligent to the general reader?<br />\nApropos the same convention, there was<br />\nan excellent warning given to those who put<br />\nthings off to the morrow, so that they may<br />\nbe able to come to a definite conclusion. The<br />\nexact point in question was in regard to having all one's facts at hand before forming a<br />\ntheory. \"No matter if we wait until Judgment Day,\" said an economist from one of<br />\nour northern colleges, \"the theory that we<br />\nmake will not be correct\u2014it will only be<br />\ncorrect for the day before Judgment Day.\"<br />\nIf we wait until we are conclusively sure<br />\nthat we are right, the chances are that we<br />\nhave waited so long that we can't go ahead!<br />\nCertainly it has been someone's fault that<br />\nthe official football \"H's\" were not awarded<br />\ntill the middle of January. The men who<br />\nplayed on the football team have had every<br />\nright to feel that they have been badly<br />\ntreated in this respect, and yet we see no<br />\nexplanation forthcoming. At first glance, it<br />\nseems as if the Athletic Association was at<br />\nfault, but with some degree of success they<br />\nshift the blame to manager and captain.<br />\nHowever .this may be, we have no intention<br />\nat present of trying to find the guilty party<br />\nor parties. The fact, and the all important<br />\n<br />\n\fTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\n<br />\n3<br />\n<br />\none, is that not until the middle of January<br />\nwere the official football \"H's\" awarded,<br />\nwhen, this year above all others, we had a<br />\nfast, conscientious, and successful team.<br />\nTruly, the least that could have been done<br />\nwould have been to award the \"H's\" as<br />\nsoon as possible, and not only the team but<br />\nthe whole undergraduate body had a right<br />\nto expect such action. It is most unfortunate<br />\nthat a condition of affairs so unnecessary<br />\nand so inexcusable should occur, and while<br />\nwe believe that the set-back it has given to<br />\ngrowing Hopkins spirit is but temporary,<br />\nyet great care should be taken in every<br />\nbranch of athletics to see that such a deplorable neglect of duty should not again exist.<br />\n<br />\nin its efforts from the fact that the first<br />\ndefinite steps toward .such an introduction<br />\nhave already been taken. There were some<br />\nwho hoped that the system might be introduced before the Xmas examinations, but<br />\nit was soon seen that such hasty action would<br />\nbe unwise. In fact, the NEWS-LETTER wishes<br />\nto emphasize the fact that unless the Honor<br />\nSystems at the several colleges are thoroughly investigated, and unless a great deal of<br />\ncare is taken to choose that system which<br />\nwould seem most to harmonize with the conditions peculiar to this University, that the<br />\nresult will be most unsatisfactory. By all<br />\nmeans we want an honor system at the Johns<br />\nHopkins, but let us be sure that we get the<br />\nHE NEWS-LETTER for a long time has best one. Any system other than the best<br />\nbeen advocating the introduction of is not only necessarily doomed to failure, but<br />\nthe Honor System into the Univer- will make the opposition against any honor<br />\nsity and therefore it feels much encouraged system very powerful.<br />\n<br />\nT<br />\n<br />\nSparks.<br />\nPeople who live in glass houses must suffer<br />\npanes.<br />\n<br />\nA little college is a dangerous thing.<br />\nDrink deep\u2014and you're caught.<br />\n<br />\nAll are not stole, that quit-us.<br />\nGraft, and the world grafts with you\u2014<br />\nSteal, and you steal into jail.<br />\nMore waste, less feed.<br />\nWords on the weather flock together.<br />\n<br />\nNever put off till to-morrow, what you<br />\nshould wear to-day.<br />\n\"I am only a field event,\" sighed the<br />\nJohnny-Jump-up, as he gazed at the coaches<br />\non the track.<br />\n<br />\nTHE ICE BERG.<br />\nA fairy princess sails the sea,<br />\nShe sings full long her siren song,<br />\nAnd she is garbed in fearful white<br />\nAnd glistens light of greenish sheen:<br />\nThe Ocean Vixen, She!<br />\nShe rides the waves with motion free<br />\nAnd smoothly glides through welling<br />\ntides;<br />\nBut gleaming 'hind her luring lips-Beware, oh ships!\u2014lest it be you<br />\nShe tastes in hellish glee.<br />\n<br />\n\f4<br />\n<br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\n<br />\nShall we Have the Honor System?<br />\nThe matter of introducing some form of the<br />\nhonor system at the University has been considered several times during the past few<br />\nyears, but has never received very serious<br />\nattention. This year, however, the classes<br />\nhave brought the question up, apparently<br />\nwith more serious intent. We feel, therefore, that the way has been prepared for<br />\nsuch a system at the Hopkins, and that now<br />\nis the time for definite action to be taken.<br />\nAccordingly the NEWS-LXTT4R considered<br />\nthat it would be well to get the opinion of<br />\nthe President and the Dean, as representative of the Faculty, and of the class presidents as representative of the student body,<br />\nwith regard to the advisability of introducing the Honor System at the Hopkins.<br />\nThe answers of those asked to express<br />\nopinions were in substance as follows:\u2014<br />\nDr. Remsen\u2014\"I am heartily in favor of<br />\nsome form of honor system. The question<br />\nof just what form to adopt is one which<br />\nshould be given careful consideration. It<br />\nseems to me advisable to investigate the<br />\nhonor systems in use at other colleges and<br />\nthen to adopt one embodying the good features of these.\"<br />\nDr. Griffin\u2014\"I was very glad indeed when<br />\nI heard that the students had spontaneously<br />\nbrought up the idea of having an honor system at the University. I think the adoption<br />\nof the honor system, even in its simplest<br />\nform, would be a long step forward. As to<br />\nthe \"police\" side of the system, I do not<br />\nthink it a good plan to pledge each man to<br />\nreport his neighbor to the faculty; for in<br />\npractice, I do not believe this would be carried out, and we do not want a system in<br />\nname only, which is not enforced. I think<br />\na good way would be to have a committee,<br />\ncomposed, say, of the presidents of the classes, which would act on all eases brought to<br />\nits notice. Then every man could be pledged<br />\neither to report each case to this committee;<br />\nor, if this restriction is not desired, to use<br />\nall his influence in stopping any cheating<br />\nwhich he may observe. This last form of<br />\n<br />\npromise would give a man some chance to<br />\nuse his own judgment, and in case the<br />\noffender did not apparently deserve the disgrace of being brought before the committee,<br />\npersonal influence could be brought to bear<br />\nupon him and the desired result secured in<br />\nthis way. But even if there is no \"police\"<br />\npledge at all, I am strongly in favor of an<br />\nhonor system. I am sure that even a simple<br />\nagreement made by the students in a body,<br />\nand a simple pledge signed to each examination paper that no help had been either given<br />\nor received, would be of very great benefit<br />\nto the moral tone of the University. Also<br />\nif the system is adopted, I think it very important that some means should be taken to<br />\nkeep it effective in coming years. For this<br />\nend, one of the upper classmen might each<br />\nyear be chosen to explain the system to the<br />\nIn this way the system<br />\nincoming class.<br />\ncould never deteriorate.\"<br />\nPresident Shackelford of the Senior Class<br />\nexpressed himself in favor of the system,<br />\nand suggested that the good points of other<br />\nsystems be accepted and the bad ones rejected.<br />\nPres. Blanck of the Junior Class said that<br />\nhe was in favor of an honor system, but did<br />\nnot think that cases should be reported to<br />\nthe faculty.<br />\nPres. Streett of the Freshman Class expressed himself as unqualifiedly in favor of<br />\nan honor system.<br />\nNo one can fail to recognize from these<br />\nopinions that there is a strong sentiment in<br />\nfavor of the adoption of an honor system,<br />\nboth among the Faculty, and among the students. Now is the time for action, and the<br />\nNEws-LETTER hopes that this action will be<br />\nAlready, in accordance<br />\nmade promptly.<br />\nwith the advice of Dr. Remsen, investigations have been made of the forms of the<br />\nsystem in use at other institutions, and the<br />\nexecutive committee of the Senior Class has<br />\nthem under consideration. By all means,<br />\nlet us have the Honor System now.<br />\n<br />\n\fTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\n<br />\n0<br />\n<br />\nTHE MUSICAL CLUBS.<br />\n<br />\nUNIVERSITY NOTES.<br />\n<br />\nThe Christmas trip of the Musical Clubs<br />\ncan not be called a great success. The failure, however, of the trip to come up to what<br />\nwas expected, is in no way due to the management, but to the poor support of the<br />\nAfter a most attractive<br />\nundergraduates.<br />\nitinerary had been arranged, half of the<br />\nclubs, especially tenors on the Glee Club,<br />\nbacked out and as a result two of the concerts had to be canceled. The two which<br />\nwere given, however, proved fairly successful. The first at Wilmington went off very<br />\nwell, was followed by a dance, and overnight the clubs were entertained at private<br />\nhouses. At Elkton there was a little too<br />\nmuch rain for things to be very pleasant, but<br />\nthe men managed to keep warm splashing<br />\naround.<br />\nIt was realized, however, that the present<br />\nconditions could not be tolerated. Half the<br />\nmen did not know the pieces, scarcely anyone had been coming out to rehearsals, and<br />\nafter the trip, Manager Maynard decided<br />\nthat a meeting must be called to take action<br />\nand see if any improvements could be made.<br />\nAs a result of the stormy meeting which was<br />\nheld last week, the clubs were entirely reorganized. In the first place, it was decided<br />\nthat, hereafter, no one be allowed to participate in a concert who does not know how<br />\nto play or to sing. Furthermore, it was decided to limit the Glee Club to 18 regular<br />\nmen: 5 first tenors, 4 seconds, 4 first bassos<br />\nand 5 second bassos.<br />\nThis will not only<br />\nmake a balanced club, but will set up some<br />\ncompetition.<br />\nA committee was also appointed to draw up a set of by-laws for the<br />\nclubs. The first action of the committee has<br />\nbeen to make a rule that any man who misses<br />\nthree consecutive rehearsals be dropped from<br />\nthe club. It is to be hoped that under this<br />\nnew organization the clubs will be more fortunate. If only every man in the undergraduate department who is eligible would<br />\ncome out, no difficulty would be encountered<br />\nin producing a club worthy of its predecessors.<br />\n<br />\nAt the meeting of the Board of Trustees of<br />\nthe Johns Hopkins University, held January<br />\n8, Mr. Waldo Newcomer was elected a member of the Board.

Thilik<br />\nof me as a poor devil, who, more<br />\nthan two hundred years after you wrote the<br />\nabove lines, is sitting (as probably you used<br />\nto sit), with legs crossed, cussing fate, and<br />\nwishing that suicide was not such a disagreeable death. But then you never were a<br />\nmartyr to science\u2014at least history doesn't<br />\nrecord the fact. If you ever were while on<br />\nearth, I trust that you run enough graft in<br />\nyour present abode to assure a warm reception for all scientists\u2014chemists in particular<br />\n\u2014who shuffle off the mortal coil. I don't<br />\nsuppose that the above quotation is exactly<br />\napropos of my case, but I wanted to start<br />\noff with a quotation from you, and that was<br />\nthe only one I could think of. Anyway, I<br />\nam a martyr to science, and it does not make<br />\nmuch difference whether the martyrdom was<br />\nin the programme of \"inevitable fate\" or<br />\nnot, considering\u2014but I'll begin from the beginning, and let you judge for yourself.<br />\nYou see, Helene\u2014(and please don't forget<br />\nthe final \"e\"), but possibly I had better say<br />\nMiss Thurston, seeing that I am addressing<br />\na comparative stranger. You see, Miss<br />\nThurston and I have been very good friends<br />\nfor some time.<br />\nWell, I love Miss Thurston\u2014and you<br />\nneedn't get such a Cimmerian grin on\u2014I<br />\nlove her because she is the most beautiful<br />\nwoman in all the world, because\u2014 well;<br />\nwhat's the use, it's all over. All over because I allowed myself to be a martyr to<br />\nthe science of my erstwhile friend, Septimus<br />\nBunsen, who has been plugging away at<br />\nchemistry for three years, and who invents<br />\na new chemical theory after each meal.<br />\nAs I have said, I have been in love with<br />\nMiss Thurston for several years.<br />\nShe is<br />\ndecidedly a popular girl owing to her ex-<br />\n<br />\n-S<br />\n<br />\ntreme beauty, her loveliness, her\u2014, and I<br />\nnaturally felt flattered that she permitted<br />\nme to see her so often. We walked together, drove together, sang together, in<br />\nshort, my existence up to recently had been<br />\nalmost an ideal one.<br />\nOne obstacle alone marred my happiness.<br />\nI had never told her of my love, and all indications pointed to the possibility that I never<br />\nwould be able to. The explanation is simple.<br />\nWhenever I would get to the point of confessing to her, by some peculiar nervousness,<br />\nthe circulation throughout my entire body<br />\nwould seem to cease instantly. I would turn<br />\nas cold as a block of ice. My skin, even to<br />\nmy scalp, would draw up, and I would shake<br />\nlike a man with the ague. No amount of<br />\nwill power would ever seem to put any<br />\nwarmth into me on these occasions, and,<br />\nwhile these occasions were rare, by reason of<br />\nmy affliction, I saw that Miss Thurston became sensibly alarmed at my conduct.<br />\nMy despair grew worse and worse. No<br />\nmedicine I could take seemed to correct the<br />\ntrouble, and each day brought me closer and<br />\ncloser to the realization, that, unless I found<br />\nsome means of proposing to Helene soon, my<br />\nchances of getting her would be nil.<br />\nWell, to make a long story short, I was<br />\ntaking dinner with Bunsen one evening before calling on Helene, and, as is always the<br />\ncase, he did most of the talking, confining<br />\nhis subjects entirely to his work in chemistry.<br />\nI was thinking too much of my own troubles<br />\nto pay much attention to him, until suddenly<br />\nhe began to talk of some new lozenge he had<br />\ncompounded.<br />\n\"My discovery will be the epoch of the<br />\nage,\" he was saying, just as he had declared<br />\nwith every new idea of his. \"What a blessing it will be to the thinly clad poor, when<br />\nthe cold winds of February chill their marrow.\"<br />\nI shuddered. \"What the devil are you<br />\ntalking about?\" I asked sympathetically.<br />\n\"My new lozenges which I have invented,<br />\nand which I shall call `Flammae.'

But there<br />\nshould be no injustice to \"Flammae.\" My<br />\ncase was as stubborn a case of chills as ever<br />\nthey would be up against, and I determined<br />\nto swallow two \"Flammae,\" just as soon as<br />\nI got into the vestibule of No. 129<br />\nSt.<br />\nA light was burning in the parlor (in anticipation of my coming, I assured myself<br />\nwith satisfaction). I closed the storm doors<br />\nbehind me and as I pulled the inner doorbell, two innocent looking little \"Flammae\"<br />\nslipped down my throat. Biggs, the haughty<br />\nbutler, ushered me in with the cheerful announcement that \"Miss Helene had just gone<br />\nup to dress!\"<br />\nSuffering Caesar! that meant a wait of<br />\nat least three-quarters of an hour, and I had<br />\nnot the least idea how soon the lozenges<br />\nwould get to work. A vague idea soon appeared, however. The room began to feel<br />\nuncomfortably oppressive, and I took the<br />\nlibrety to turn off the iron radiator in the<br />\ncorner. The radiators within me were just<br />\ngetting up steam. The perspiration began<br />\nto bead out on my forehead, and I pulled<br />\nout a handkerchief. The irritation caused<br />\nby the cloth passing over my skin only<br />\nseemed to augment the porous emission, and<br />\nwith a recklessness that surprised me, I be-<br />\n<br />\n7<br />\n<br />\ngan to fan vigorously with my prospective<br />\nmother-in-law's picture, which I found on<br />\nthe mantelpiece.<br />\nTo my horror, my collar began to wilt, and<br />\nalthough the mercury stood at only 45\u00b0 outside, I seemed fairly to sizzle. I stopped<br />\nfanning, and tried to cool myself by gazing<br />\nfixedly at a painting of \"Winter in Russia.\"<br />\nThe snow may as well have represented cotton so far as its effect on me was concerned,<br />\nand I started to think what fools painters<br />\nwere. Somehow I could not concentrate my<br />\nmind on painters for long, and I realized<br />\nthat \"Flammae\" was calculated to give<br />\nbrain fever, if taken in large enough doses.<br />\nI got up and walked toward the window.<br />\nThe floor seemed to be clouds, on which I<br />\nfelt my feet touch now and then with the<br />\ntread of angels. Then I tried to picture<br />\nangels walking on Axminster carpets, but<br />\nby some strange arrangement, the angels<br />\nseemed to be roller-skating on \"Flammae\"<br />\nlozenges. Suddenly I seemed to hear a voice<br />\na way off\u2014but where\u2014bu\u2014wh\u2014voice\u2014a<br />\nI don't remember any more. The hospital<br />\nsurgeon told me that when the ambulance<br />\narrived, the orderlies took me up from<br />\nthe floor where I lay in a heap, motherin-law's picture stuffed down my shirt<br />\nbosom. He says I was muttering something<br />\nabout steam heaters on Mt. Arrarat. Mr.<br />\nThurston, he says, ordered me to be taken to<br />\nthe hospital, and cared for tenderly in the<br />\ninsane word. And Helene\u2014ah, that's too<br />\nhorrible to think about. Anyway, I saw an<br />\nannouncement to-day of her engagement to<br />\n\"Mr. Septimus Bunsen, the talented young<br />\nchemist.\"<br />\nMORNING MAIL.<br />\nPostmaster Green\u2014There is a bill in your<br />\nbox.<br />\nInsolvent One\u2014Ah, 'tis but a fee mail.<br />\nLIGHTS ON HISTORY.<br />\nDr. B.

Many of the leading<br />\ncolleges, like Penn., Swarthmore, Georgetown and University of Virginia have signified their intention of sending competitors,<br />\nwhile the prep. schools and Y. M. C.

Hopkins men are urged to avail<br />\nthemselves of this opportunity to learn of<br />\n<br />\nthe missionary activity in the American colleges. It is interesting to note that over<br />\n12,000 students were engaged in systematic<br />\nmission study during the past academic year.<br />\nA mission study class is now meeting regularly on Tuesdays, under the leadership of<br />\nJ. F. Gressitt. Another class is to be started<br />\nshortly.<br />\nA senior Bible study class started this<br />\nmonth, with Mr. R. V. D.

These were<br />\nMessrs. B. M. Pavaloff, R. V. D. Magoffin,<br />\nDaniel Ellison, W. H. Gahan, Isaac Potts,<br />\nand J. M. Matthhews. Since there has previously been difficulty in arranging dates for<br />\nthe meetings of the club, it was decided to<br />\nmake the fourth Friday of each month the<br />\nregular time for meeting. The next date<br />\nwill, therefore be January 26 and, after this<br />\nearly notice, a large attendance is expected.<br />\nAt this meeting it was also decided to have<br />\nMr. Addison appoint a Committee of Instruction for the benefit of new members of the<br />\nclub. Three of the best chess players of the<br />\nUniversity will be on this committee, and it<br />\nis hoped that this will encourage new men<br />\nto come out.<br />\n<br />\n*******************************************************************<br />\nAN OPPORTUNITY TO.

However, from whatVI e understand of the matter, wa believe that the action was a wise one. At least the new idea<br />\nis worth a trial.<br />\nThe truth of the matter is, that for the<br />\nlast two or three years, trial for places has<br />\nWith an unlimited<br />\nbeen made too easy.<br />\nnumber of places open, men have been able<br />\nto make these places with almost no difficulty, until the idea naturally developed<br />\namong the students, that to be a member of<br />\nthe clubs was no great honor. Consequently<br />\nattendance at rehearsals became more and<br />\nmore indifferent, while members began to<br />\nparticipate in only such concerts that promised a considerable amount of \"fun.\" To<br />\nsuch an extent was this true that the management was often placed in an embarassing,<br />\nif not dishonorable light, before its patrons.<br />\nWhen concerts are arranged with societies,<br />\nit is necessary for the management to specify<br />\nthe number of men to take part. Frequently<br />\nas with the Christmas trip this year, only<br />\nhalf the specified number seemed to feel in<br />\nany way bound to appear. Consequently<br />\ntwo concerts of the tour had to be canceled.<br /><br />\nM<br /><br />\nUnder the new arrangement, by limiting<br />\nthe Glee Club to Eighteen men, it is thought<br />\nthat competition will be created for a place<br />\non the club and that better results will be<br />\nobtained.<br />\nGAIN we take occasion to congratulate<br />\nthe Dance Committee on the arrangements at the last dance. The arrangements last Friday evening, we think,<br />\nwere possibly even superior to those at the<br />\nfirst dance. Certainly the change in the<br />\nstyle of the programme was an improvement,<br />\nand the addition of coffee to the supper menu<br />\nwas a happy one.<br />\nIt should be gratifying to the committee<br />\nto recall the splendid attendance, when it<br />\nis remembered that on that same evening the<br />\nThe latter is<br />\n\"Fridays\" gave a dance.<br />\npopular among the younger set, but it was<br />\nnoticeable that many of the couples that<br />\n.danced in McCoy Hall are either members<br />\nof, or usually attend the \"Fridays.\"<br />\nConsidering this growing popularity of<br />\nthe Hopkins cotillions under the present<br />\nmanagement, we think that the chaperones<br />\nshould feel more than ever called upon to<br />\nlend their charming presence at the dances.<br />\nIndeed, had it not been for the two of the<br />\ntwenty-two selected matrons who were present on last Friday evening, the condition<br />\nwould have been a most embarassing one,<br /><br />\nA<br /><br />\n2<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br /><br />\nT seems, that, despite the general criticism expressed among the students of<br />\nthe University regarding the disgraceof care given to the Trophy Room,<br />\nlack<br />\nful<br />\nno steps whatever are being taken to remedy<br />\nthe evil. The matter has become so pressing that it demands the immediate and special attention of the Athletic Association.<br />\nThe banners and pennants\u2014which, from<br />\ntheir associations with hard-won contests,<br />\nand their material expression of a proud athletic record, should be handled with respect<br />\n\u2014are slapped against the wall with no more<br />\nconsideration than were they valued only for<br />\nthe cloth that is in them. Absolutely no<br />\nthought seems to be given as to whether they<br />\nare hung in the right places, or at what<br />\nangle they point; and indeed visitors are<br />\noften compelled to express amused wonder<br />\nto find the trophy of one victory hanging<br />\non top of that of another.<br />\nWhen attempts are made to find the reasons for such a condition, the blame is conveniently shifted from one shoulder to another with all the blandness of Chinese<br />\ndiplomacy. Men in the Athletic Association,<br />\nwho, by virtue of their high positions, should<br />\nconsider themselves responsible for the management of the Association, and a consequent shame for the existing condition, insist that the fault is with the \"Dance\" committee, protesting that since the latter<br />\ndraws upon the Trophy Room for<br />\ndecorations, it is the latter's business to see<br />\nthat the banners, etc., are returned to their<br />\nproper places. Such an explanation may be<br />\nsatisfactory to those who hide behind it, but<br />\nit certainly discloses a woeful absence of<br />\nsystematic administration.<br />\nIt is within the power of the Association<br />\nto say by whom these trophies may be used,<br />\nand upon what conditions. If these conditions are not observed, it is the business<br />\nof the Association to revoke the privilege.<br /><br />\nI<br /><br />\nThe American Economic Convention which<br />\nwas recently held at this University afforded<br />\nan excellent example of the shortcomings of<br />\nthe English language. Dr. Hollander in his<br />\npaper, \"The Present State of the Theory of<br />\nDistribution,\" made an earnest appeal that<br /><br />\nmore political enonomists devote themselves<br />\nto a thorough study of present conditions<br />\ninstead of spending so much time in theorizing. \"It is much easier,\" said Dr. Hollander,\"'to spin cob-webs in a closet,' than<br />\nto get down to real work, and the remedy<br />\nlay in 'theorization through facts.'\" At<br />\nthe close of his address, a number of distinguished economists eagerly struggled for the<br />\nright to tell the audience that they were immensely surprised to find that Dr. Hollander<br />\nwas so diametrically opposed to all theorization, and mis-spent a great deal of energy in<br />\nproving the value of good theorization\u2014as<br />\na matter of fact just what Dr. Hollander had<br />\nbeen advocating. Truly, when the English<br />\nlanguage when carefully used can be so easily misunderstood even by the most aeute<br />\nminds, how can we ever be sure of presenting our views so that they may be invariably<br />\nintelligent to the general reader?<br />\nApropos the same convention, there was<br />\nan excellent warning given to those who put<br />\nthings off to the morrow, so that they may<br />\nbe able to come to a definite conclusion. The<br />\nexact point in question was in regard to having all one's facts at hand before forming a<br />\ntheory. \"No matter if we wait until Judgment Day,\" said an economist from one of<br />\nour northern colleges, \"the theory that we<br />\nmake will not be correct\u2014it will only be<br />\ncorrect for the day before Judgment Day.\"<br />\nIf we wait until we are conclusively sure<br />\nthat we are right, the chances are that we<br />\nhave waited so long that we can't go ahead!<br />\nCertainly it has been someone's fault that<br />\nthe official football \"H's\" were not awarded<br />\ntill the middle of January. The men who<br />\nplayed on the football team have had every<br />\nright to feel that they have been badly<br />\ntreated in this respect, and yet we see no<br />\nexplanation forthcoming. At first glance, it<br />\nseems as if the Athletic Association was at<br />\nfault, but with some degree of success they<br />\nshift the blame to manager and captain.<br />\nHowever .this may be, we have no intention<br />\nat present of trying to find the guilty party<br />\nor parties. The fact, and the all important<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br /><br />\n3<br /><br />\none, is that not until the middle of January<br />\nwere the official football \"H's\" awarded,<br />\nwhen, this year above all others, we had a<br />\nfast, conscientious, and successful team.<br />\nTruly, the least that could have been done<br />\nwould have been to award the \"H's\" as<br />\nsoon as possible, and not only the team but<br />\nthe whole undergraduate body had a right<br />\nto expect such action. It is most unfortunate<br />\nthat a condition of affairs so unnecessary<br />\nand so inexcusable should occur, and while<br />\nwe believe that the set-back it has given to<br />\ngrowing Hopkins spirit is but temporary,<br />\nyet great care should be taken in every<br />\nbranch of athletics to see that such a deplorable neglect of duty should not again exist.<br /><br />\nin its efforts from the fact that the first<br />\ndefinite steps toward .such an introduction<br />\nhave already been taken. There were some<br />\nwho hoped that the system might be introduced before the Xmas examinations, but<br />\nit was soon seen that such hasty action would<br />\nbe unwise. In fact, the NEWS-LETTER wishes<br />\nto emphasize the fact that unless the Honor<br />\nSystems at the several colleges are thoroughly investigated, and unless a great deal of<br />\ncare is taken to choose that system which<br />\nwould seem most to harmonize with the conditions peculiar to this University, that the<br />\nresult will be most unsatisfactory. By all<br />\nmeans we want an honor system at the Johns<br />\nHopkins, but let us be sure that we get the<br />\nHE NEWS-LETTER for a long time has best one.

This year, however, the classes<br />\nhave brought the question up, apparently<br />\nwith more serious intent. We feel, therefore, that the way has been prepared for<br />\nsuch a system at the Hopkins, and that now<br />\nis the time for definite action to be taken.<br />\nAccordingly the NEWS-LXTT4R considered<br />\nthat it would be well to get the opinion of<br />\nthe President and the Dean, as representative of the Faculty, and of the class presidents as representative of the student body,<br />\nwith regard to the advisability of introducing the Honor System at the Hopkins.<br />\nThe answers of those asked to express<br />\nopinions were in substance as follows:\u2014<br />\nDr. Remsen\u2014\"I am heartily in favor of<br />\nsome form of honor system. The question<br />\nof just what form to adopt is one which<br />\nshould be given careful consideration. It<br />\nseems to me advisable to investigate the<br />\nhonor systems in use at other colleges and<br />\nthen to adopt one embodying the good features of these.\"<br />\nDr. Griffin\u2014\"I was very glad indeed when<br />\nI heard that the students had spontaneously<br />\nbrought up the idea of having an honor system at the University. I think the adoption<br />\nof the honor system, even in its simplest<br />\nform, would be a long step forward. As to<br />\nthe \"police\" side of the system, I do not<br />\nthink it a good plan to pledge each man to<br />\nreport his neighbor to the faculty; for in<br />\npractice, I do not believe this would be carried out, and we do not want a system in<br />\nname only, which is not enforced. I think<br />\na good way would be to have a committee,<br />\ncomposed, say, of the presidents of the classes, which would act on all eases brought to<br />\nits notice. Then every man could be pledged<br />\neither to report each case to this committee;<br />\nor, if this restriction is not desired, to use<br />\nall his influence in stopping any cheating<br />\nwhich he may observe. This last form of<br /><br />\npromise would give a man some chance to<br />\nuse his own judgment, and in case the<br />\noffender did not apparently deserve the disgrace of being brought before the committee,<br />\npersonal influence could be brought to bear<br />\nupon him and the desired result secured in<br />\nthis way. But even if there is no \"police\"<br />\npledge at all, I am strongly in favor of an<br />\nhonor system. I am sure that even a simple<br />\nagreement made by the students in a body,<br />\nand a simple pledge signed to each examination paper that no help had been either given<br />\nor received, would be of very great benefit<br />\nto the moral tone of the University. Also<br />\nif the system is adopted, I think it very important that some means should be taken to<br />\nkeep it effective in coming years. For this<br />\nend, one of the upper classmen might each<br />\nyear be chosen to explain the system to the<br />\nIn this way the system<br />\nincoming class.<br />\ncould never deteriorate.\"<br />\nPresident Shackelford of the Senior Class<br />\nexpressed himself in favor of the system,<br />\nand suggested that the good points of other<br />\nsystems be accepted and the bad ones rejected.<br />\nPres. Blanck of the Junior Class said that<br />\nhe was in favor of an honor system, but did<br />\nnot think that cases should be reported to<br />\nthe faculty.<br />\nPres. Streett of the Freshman Class expressed himself as unqualifiedly in favor of<br />\nan honor system.<br />\nNo one can fail to recognize from these<br />\nopinions that there is a strong sentiment in<br />\nfavor of the adoption of an honor system,<br />\nboth among the Faculty, and among the students. Now is the time for action, and the<br />\nNEws-LETTER hopes that this action will be<br />\nAlready, in accordance<br />\nmade promptly.<br />\nwith the advice of Dr. Remsen, investigations have been made of the forms of the<br />\nsystem in use at other institutions, and the<br />\nexecutive committee of the Senior Class has<br />\nthem under consideration. By all means,<br />\nlet us have the Honor System now.<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br /><br />\n0<br /><br />\nTHE MUSICAL CLUBS.<br /><br />\nUNIVERSITY NOTES.<br /><br />\nThe Christmas trip of the Musical Clubs<br />\ncan not be called a great success. The failure, however, of the trip to come up to what<br />\nwas expected, is in no way due to the management, but to the poor support of the<br />\nAfter a most attractive<br />\nundergraduates.<br />\nitinerary had been arranged, half of the<br />\nclubs, especially tenors on the Glee Club,<br />\nbacked out and as a result two of the concerts had to be canceled. The two which<br />\nwere given, however, proved fairly successful. The first at Wilmington went off very<br />\nwell, was followed by a dance, and overnight the clubs were entertained at private<br />\nhouses. At Elkton there was a little too<br />\nmuch rain for things to be very pleasant, but<br />\nthe men managed to keep warm splashing<br />\naround.<br />\nIt was realized, however, that the present<br />\nconditions could not be tolerated. Half the<br />\nmen did not know the pieces, scarcely anyone had been coming out to rehearsals, and<br />\nafter the trip, Manager Maynard decided<br />\nthat a meeting must be called to take action<br />\nand see if any improvements could be made.<br />\nAs a result of the stormy meeting which was<br />\nheld last week, the clubs were entirely reorganized. In the first place, it was decided<br />\nthat, hereafter, no one be allowed to participate in a concert who does not know how<br />\nto play or to sing. Furthermore, it was decided to limit the Glee Club to 18 regular<br />\nmen: 5 first tenors, 4 seconds, 4 first bassos<br />\nand 5 second bassos.<br />\nThis will not only<br />\nmake a balanced club, but will set up some<br />\ncompetition.<br />\nA committee was also appointed to draw up a set of by-laws for the<br />\nclubs. The first action of the committee has<br />\nbeen to make a rule that any man who misses<br />\nthree consecutive rehearsals be dropped from<br />\nthe club. It is to be hoped that under this<br />\nnew organization the clubs will be more fortunate. If only every man in the undergraduate department who is eligible would<br />\ncome out, no difficulty would be encountered<br />\nin producing a club worthy of its predecessors.<br /><br />\nAt the meeting of the Board of Trustees of<br />\nthe Johns Hopkins University, held January<br />\n8, Mr. Waldo Newcomer was elected a member of the Board.

The explanation is simple.<br />\nWhenever I would get to the point of confessing to her, by some peculiar nervousness,<br />\nthe circulation throughout my entire body<br />\nwould seem to cease instantly. I would turn<br />\nas cold as a block of ice. My skin, even to<br />\nmy scalp, would draw up, and I would shake<br />\nlike a man with the ague.

I closed the storm doors<br />\nbehind me and as I pulled the inner doorbell, two innocent looking little \"Flammae\"<br />\nslipped down my throat. Biggs, the haughty<br />\nbutler, ushered me in with the cheerful announcement that \"Miss Helene had just gone<br />\nup to dress!\"<br />\nSuffering Caesar! that meant a wait of<br />\nat least three-quarters of an hour, and I had<br />\nnot the least idea how soon the lozenges<br />\nwould get to work. A vague idea soon appeared, however. The room began to feel<br />\nuncomfortably oppressive, and I took the<br />\nlibrety to turn off the iron radiator in the<br />\ncorner. The radiators within me were just<br />\ngetting up steam. The perspiration began<br />\nto bead out on my forehead, and I pulled<br />\nout a handkerchief. The irritation caused<br />\nby the cloth passing over my skin only<br />\nseemed to augment the porous emission, and<br />\nwith a recklessness that surprised me, I be-<br /><br />\n7<br /><br />\ngan to fan vigorously with my prospective<br />\nmother-in-law's picture, which I found on<br />\nthe mantelpiece.<br />\nTo my horror, my collar began to wilt, and<br />\nalthough the mercury stood at only 45\u00b0 outside, I seemed fairly to sizzle. I stopped<br />\nfanning, and tried to cool myself by gazing<br />\nfixedly at a painting of \"Winter in Russia.\"<br />\nThe snow may as well have represented cotton so far as its effect on me was concerned,<br />\nand I started to think what fools painters<br />\nwere. Somehow I could not concentrate my<br />\nmind on painters for long, and I realized<br />\nthat \"Flammae\" was calculated to give<br />\nbrain fever, if taken in large enough doses.<br />\nI got up and walked toward the window.<br />\nThe floor seemed to be clouds, on which I<br />\nfelt my feet touch now and then with the<br />\ntread of angels. Then I tried to picture<br />\nangels walking on Axminster carpets, but<br />\nby some strange arrangement, the angels<br />\nseemed to be roller-skating on \"Flammae\"<br />\nlozenges. Suddenly I seemed to hear a voice<br />\na way off\u2014but where\u2014bu\u2014wh\u2014voice\u2014a<br />\nI don't remember any more. The hospital<br />\nsurgeon told me that when the ambulance<br />\narrived, the orderlies took me up from<br />\nthe floor where I lay in a heap, motherin-law's picture stuffed down my shirt<br />\nbosom. He says I was muttering something<br />\nabout steam heaters on Mt. Arrarat.
