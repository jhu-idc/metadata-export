These Baltimore birds were that<br />\nfreshman's sole companions until the Office of Residential Life<br />\nopened at 9:00 a.m. Soon dozens of orange shirted orientation<br />\nworkers emerged from the streets of Baltimore to drag the anxious<br />\nfreshman from their more than anxious (almost neurotic in some<br />\ncases) parents. The male orientation workers, though stuffed with<br />\nfree, stale, doughnuts were still hungry enough to scan the long lines<br />\nof waiting cars for glimpses of the incoming beauties from the<br />\nswamps of New Jersey. As those chosen few were divested of<br />\neverything of value, the others, in due time, were eventually<br />\nserviced.<br />\nEveryone was relieved of their prized possessions and it was the<br />\nsame prized possessions every time;stereo, hairdryer, television, high<br />\nschool I.D. card, posters, tennis racket, teddy bears, golf clubs,<br />\npotted plants, pot plants, high school yearbook, electric fan,lacrosse<br />\nsticks and Mom's last minute care packages.<br />\nNaturally, their most prized possessions, plants and student<br />\nHandbooks, were cradled in their hands. Much to each freshman's<br />\nrelief, he or she was soon on his or her way to the dormitory,<br />\nensuring that those precious popcorn poppers made their way to<br />\n<br />\ntheir rooms while those shrewd orientation workers were pushing<br />\nMom and Dad toward the distant parking fields of Garland Hall. Left<br />\nin the room, these desperately brave neophytes confronted their<br />\ngrimy, miniscule, unpainted cages and promptly went into catatonia.<br />\nAdding insult to injury, if the room wasn't enough, there was the<br />\nroommate. Moment of silence. Sigh. (Mental Note: \"Next year be<br />\nsure to insist upon a single room .... At least I got the bed I wanted<br />\n...

Gradually,<br />\nhowever, your senses come back, and in a few days, you begin to<br />\nrealize how John Mitchell must feel living in a minimum security<br />\nprision camp.<br />\nIf it's any comfort, countless freshmen have felt the same way<br />\nthroughout the century-old ritual of moving-in at Hopkins. Take,<br />\nfor instance, the vision of Woodrow Wilson (Ph.D.'86) moving into<br />\nhis lodgings a ramshackle rooming hourse near the original Hopkins<br />\ncampus where the Walters Art Gallery now squats. Over his bony<br />\nshoulder is slung a long canvas bag filled with hickory shafted golf<br />\nclubs and music from his Glee Club days at Princeton. Behind him a<br />\nporter carrying a large trunk on his back puffs his way up the narrow<br />\nstairs and manages to gasp, \"Is we here yet, Mistuh Wilson?\"<br />\n\"No, not quite,\" answers Woody (as his friends call him) with a<br />\npeculiar glint in his eyes that could only recall the twenty bricks he<br />\nhad packed in the trunk as a ruse on the aged blackamoor.<br />\nIn a matter of minutes they reach the loft where they find one<br />\nPhineas Beanstock (of the Boston Beanstocks) stretched lazily on<br />\nthe ostremoor. \"Do you wish to join me in a cup of tea, my dear<br />\nboy?\"<br />\n\"I don't think there's enough room for both us, you malicious<br />\nwiseacre,\" chortles Woody,\"and you, Jones, place that trunk in a safe<br />\nspot.''<br />\n\"Dere's no safe spot in Mobtown, Mistuh Wilson,\" grunts the<br />\nporter.<br />\n\"Oh dear me,\" sighs Woody, \"I am begining to think Baltimore is<br />\n<br />\nas barbarous as I thought it was. And 1 didn't bring an interpreter.<br />\nalong.\" And we last see Woody Wilson getting himself a cup of tea<br />\nand fortifying it with several jiggers of Jack Daniels.<br />\nThen there is the celebrated case of Frank \"Mugsy\" Muldoon (of<br />\nthe Southside Muldoons) who tried to sneak a still into his room in<br />\n1927, scarely a year after the Old dorms were opened. Mugsy had a<br />\ngood head for business and knew his sour mash enterprise would pay<br />\nfor his tuition many times over. Smuggling in the still was a very<br />\neasy matter; Mugsy painted the palms of the porters- with ten dollar<br />\nbills and slipped a Mickey Finn into the Dean's tea at an Orientation<br />\nluncheon. Let it be said that the class of '31 was the happiest on<br />\nrecord, despite the unfortunate Depression.<br />\nThe Big Band Era was in full swing when an awkward teenager<br />\nwith a foul mouth arrived from the wilds of West Baltimore to take<br />\nup residence in the dorms. His name was Spiro T. Agnew and his<br />\ncareer at Hopkins Lasted little more than a semester. From the start<br />\nit was obvious \"Teddy\" was a strange bird and unable to fit into the<br />\nHopkins ideal. On his very first day here, he called his fellow<br />\ndOrmmates \"impudent snobs, the motherfuckers,\" and complained<br />\nto anyone who would come close to him that there was no eatery in<br />\nthe immediate area that served tunafish milkshakes.<br />\nHappier days were in store for Hopkins as the calendar flipped to<br />\nthe fifties. The freshmen beanie was just large enough to contain the<br />\nconsciousness of the. typical Hopkins student, as the file on Otis<br />\nMcGuirk will show. Upon his arrival, Otis went into a tissy when he<br />\nlearned that Hopkins had no Civil Defense Plan, that the nearest<br />\nbomb shelter to the dorms was Gilman Hall. \"That's nearly two<br />\nhundred yards,\" the paranoid cried. Well, poor Otis couldn't take<br />\nthe anxiety and he left school after Thanksgiving to become a<br />\nconductor on the Philadelphia subway system.<br />\n<br />\n\fEJAYS*BLUEJAYS*BLU<br />\nA History of Homewood Sports<br />\nBy Andrew Cohen<br />\n<br />\nFor many years the game of Lacrosse has been<br />\nsynonymous with sports at Johns Hopkins. In<br />\nrecent years, though, strong finishes by the<br />\nbaseball, swimming, basketball, and soccer teams,<br />\nas well as new entries from the growing women's<br />\nathletic department have taken some of the<br />\nlimelight from the perennial contending laxers.<br />\n<br />\n\fL<br />\n<br />\nooking back, it was exactly 42 years ago<br />\nwhen Johns Hopkins began its first year with<br />\na collegiate sports program on the amateur<br />\nlevel. In doing so, they accepted the<br />\nphilosophy of the then University President<br />\nAmes who believed that college athletics<br />\nexisted for all students and not just the<br />\ntalented few. Up until 1935, Hopkins had<br />\nbeen part of the increasing<br />\ncommercialization of intercollegiate sports<br />\nby offering huge scholarships and guarantees<br />\nto star athletes and charging steep admission<br />\nrates to all spectators.<br />\nToday, according to Director of Athletics<br />\nRobert Scott, this philosophy of \"sports for<br />\nall\" remains central to the Hopkins program.<br />\nJohns Hopkins continues as one of the only<br />\nschools of its caliber not offering an athletic<br />\nscholarship program. It should also be noted<br />\nthat all Blue Jay sporting events, with the<br />\nexception of lacrosse, will go without an<br />\nadmission fee in 1977-78.<br />\nAnother major date was January, 1965,<br />\nthe month in which the Newton H. White<br />\nAthletic Center opened its doors to the<br />\nHopkins community. Named after Colonel<br />\nNewton White, a philanthropic friend of the<br />\nUniversity, the center has served as a focal<br />\npoint for all the athletic as well as much of<br />\nthe social life that has occured here over the<br />\npast 12 years. The Athletic Center continues<br />\nto be a meeting ground for all, open daily 10<br />\na.m.-10 p.m., Sundays, 1 p.m.-9 p.m.<br />\nOver the past ten years lacrosse has<br />\ndominated the Hopkins sports scene, and<br />\nrightfully so, due to its many successes. In<br />\n1968, Coach Robert Scott put together one<br />\nof the finest teams in Hopkin's illustrious lax<br />\nhistory. Led by all-American Downie<br />\nMcCarty, Phil Kneip, and Joe Cowan, the<br />\nJays ran roughshod over all opponents,<br />\ndefeating Maryland 10-8 in the<br />\nchampionship game. The 1969 season saw<br />\ndefensemen Mike Clark and Paul Weiss take<br />\ncharge, sending the Blue Jays to their second<br />\nstraight championship, this time sharing the<br />\nhonors with West Point.<br />\nAfter fighting off some lean years in '70<br />\nand '71 and losing in the final to Maryland<br />\nin '72 and '73 the Jays finally brought the<br />\ncrown back to Homewood with an<br />\nincredible 17-12 championship win over the<br />\nTerps in 1974. The Hopkins lax team came<br />\nclose to taking another championship just<br />\nlast year, but was overpowered by a strong<br />\nCornell team 16-8 in the season's finale.<br />\nThe exploits of the swimming team over<br />\nthe past few years have offered reasons for<br />\nstudent cheer. In 1970, under the reigns of<br />\nFrank Comfort, an outstanding coach who<br />\nhas since left for North Carolina, the<br />\nswimmers won the Middle Atlantic<br />\n<br />\nConference and Mason-Dixon<br />\nchampionships, defeating perennial winner<br />\nCatholic University. Since then, Blue Jay<br />\nswimmers have never failed to take these<br />\nchampionships and, in fact, have continued<br />\nto move forward in the NCAA College<br />\nDivision, taking that championship just last<br />\nyear. The list of individual all-Americans on<br />\nthe Jay squad continues to grow, with such<br />\nnames as Bill Milne, Mark Horning, Mike<br />\nBay, and Maria Mock.<br />\nThe Hopkins baseball team completed<br />\ntheir most successful season in history in<br />\n1977. For the first time the Blue Jay nine,<br />\nunder the guidance of coach Dennis Cox,<br />\nfinished first in the Southeast Division of the<br />\nMiddle Atlantic Conference, defeating a<br />\nhighly acclaimed Widener team in the finals<br />\nby the score of 2-1. Stars of both the<br />\nsuccessful 1976 and 1977 teams, Dave<br />\nEmala and Dave Lewing were named to the<br />\nAcademic all-American team of 1977. Emala<br />\nhas since been signed by the Baltimore<br />\nOrioles and is playing in the minor leagues.<br />\nRecent football at Hopkins reached its<br />\npeak under Coach Denny Cox from<br />\n1971-1973. In those seasons, led by Jack<br />\nThomas and Bill Nolan, the team posted<br />\nconsecutive 5-3 records with notable<br />\nvictories over arch rival Western Maryland.<br />\n1974-1977 saw the quality of play drop as<br />\nthe team ran up consecutive 3-5 records.<br />\nAccording to Coach Cox, though, the future<br />\nholds pleasant surprises.<br />\nSoccer at Hopkins was never considered<br />\nto be a significant sport until Coach Bob<br />\nOliver turned out a championship team in<br />\n<br />\n1976. Led by top scorers Greg Cunningham<br />\nand Joe Rutkowski and goalie Ken Seusse,<br />\nthe team compliled a record breaking 15-3-1<br />\nmark and was declared Middle Atlantic<br />\nSouthern Division Champions.<br />\nThe Blue Jay basketball team began to<br />\ntake shape when Coach Gary Rupert entered<br />\nthe scene in 1970. \"That championship<br />\nseason\" came in 1973-74 when the cagers<br />\ntook the Middle States championship with<br />\nan outstanding 17-7 record. Top scorer Bob<br />\nFriedman, key assist man John Rutter, and<br />\ntop rebounder Bill Jews,led the way.<br />\nOther varsity sports such as fencing,<br />\nwrestling, track and field, cross country, and<br />\ntennis have continued to offer fan interest<br />\nthroughout the past ten years.<br />\nA woman's program developed in 1971 by<br />\nDr. Joyce Hogan and now under the<br />\nleadership of Micul Morse has grown to the<br />\npoint where the women athletes of Hopkins<br />\nare today competing successfully in the areas<br />\nof fencing, tennis, swimming, squash,<br />\nbasketball, field hockey, and lacrosse. Such<br />\nfemale stars as olympic swimmer Maria<br />\nMock and junior olympic fencer Lori<br />\nKelleher have come up through the Hopkins<br />\nprogram.<br />\nIndeed Johns Hopkins has had a glorious<br />\nhistory in the athletic world. For along with<br />\nall the championships the University has<br />\ncollected, it has uniquely remained steadfast<br />\nin its philosophy that sports are for all to<br />\nenjoy and the University is not to be made,<br />\nas Dr. Wilson Shaffer wrote in his recent<br />\nbook, \"a pawn of promotional activities that<br />\nmake (them) simply public entertainment\".<br />\n<br />\n\fWelcome<br />\nNew and Returning Students<br />\n<br />\nMCAT<br />\n<br />\nYoung Adult Fellowship provides opportunities for Bible<br />\nstudies, worship, prayer meetings, picnics, social action, hikes,<br />\nsongfests, and whatever needs may be suggested.<br />\n<br />\nPREPARATION<br />\n<br />\n9:00 a.m. student-led worship<br />\n9:30 a.m. Bible study<br />\n11:00 a.m. worship<br />\nSunday Sept. 11 - Be our guest at lunch.

For example, this year,<br />\ntuition is $3750 for undergraduates, a rise of $250 over the<br />\npreceeding year. This is an increase of about 6%. Over the same<br />\nperiod, the estimated rate of inflation was also about 6%, so the<br />\nvalue of tuition this year is nearly the same as it was last year.<br />\nThe real dollar cost to Hopkins students and their families has<br />\nbeen close to level over the last decade. In 1966-67, tuition was<br />\n$1825. Measured in 1967 dollars, last year's cost ($3500) would<br />\namount to $1, 987, an increase of less than 1%. The real value of<br />\nHopkins' tuition has actually declined from a peak in 1971-72, when<br />\nthe fee of $2700 would have valued $2190 in 1967 dollars.<br />\nTuitiOn for 1978-79 is projected to be about $3950, with the<br />\nadministration holding the figure under $4000 until 1979-80. By the<br />\ntime today's freshmen are seniors, tuition will probably be about<br />\n$4500.<br />\n<br />\nAccording to Krueger, tuition is one of the first items determined<br />\nduring the annual Hopkins budget procedure. In addition to the<br />\nprojected inflation rate, competitiveness with other private<br />\nuniversities is considered before a final figure is reached. Other<br />\nprivate institutions around the country are feeling the same<br />\ninflationary squeeze. Indeed, Hopkins may hold the line In<br />\n1975-76, tuition here was $3300. Last year, it went to $3500, an<br />\nincrement of $200. Over the same period, tuition at Yale rose from<br />\n$4050 to $4400; at the University of Pennsylvania it soared from<br />\n$3790 to $4125; at Amherst, it increased from $3795 to $3975; and<br />\nat Tufts it went from $3550 to $3800.<br />\nThe amount of tuition charged is made with input from many<br />\npeople in the administration. Krueger describes it as \"one of the<br />\nhardest thought out decisions we make around here. We don't want<br />\nto be the front-runner with tuition increases, but we just can't afford<br />\nto lag.\"<br />\nYoung people today should not fear the astronomical costs<br />\nprojected for educating children in twenty years, says Krueger.<br />\n\"People's incomes today are not what they were ten years ago.<br />\nEducation still takes, and will still take, the same percentage of a<br />\nfamily's income..., student aid has also tried to keep up with higher<br />\ncosts.\"<br />\n<br />\nChristrnas Reservations<br />\nTake advantage of the special fares<br />\nnow available.

These Baltimore birds were that<br />\nfreshman's sole companions until the Office of Residential Life<br />\nopened at 9:00 a.m. Soon dozens of orange shirted orientation<br />\nworkers emerged from the streets of Baltimore to drag the anxious<br />\nfreshman from their more than anxious (almost neurotic in some<br />\ncases) parents. The male orientation workers, though stuffed with<br />\nfree, stale, doughnuts were still hungry enough to scan the long lines<br />\nof waiting cars for glimpses of the incoming beauties from the<br />\nswamps of New Jersey. As those chosen few were divested of<br />\neverything of value, the others, in due time, were eventually<br />\nserviced.<br />\nEveryone was relieved of their prized possessions and it was the<br />\nsame prized possessions every time;stereo, hairdryer, television, high<br />\nschool I.D. card, posters, tennis racket, teddy bears, golf clubs,<br />\npotted plants, pot plants, high school yearbook, electric fan,lacrosse<br />\nsticks and Mom's last minute care packages.<br />\nNaturally, their most prized possessions, plants and student<br />\nHandbooks, were cradled in their hands. Much to each freshman's<br />\nrelief, he or she was soon on his or her way to the dormitory,<br />\nensuring that those precious popcorn poppers made their way to<br /><br />\ntheir rooms while those shrewd orientation workers were pushing<br />\nMom and Dad toward the distant parking fields of Garland Hall. Left<br />\nin the room, these desperately brave neophytes confronted their<br />\ngrimy, miniscule, unpainted cages and promptly went into catatonia.<br />\nAdding insult to injury, if the room wasn't enough, there was the<br />\nroommate. Moment of silence. Sigh. (Mental Note: \"Next year be<br />\nsure to insist upon a single room .... At least I got the bed I wanted<br />\n...

Gradually,<br />\nhowever, your senses come back, and in a few days, you begin to<br />\nrealize how John Mitchell must feel living in a minimum security<br />\nprision camp.<br />\nIf it's any comfort, countless freshmen have felt the same way<br />\nthroughout the century-old ritual of moving-in at Hopkins. Take,<br />\nfor instance, the vision of Woodrow Wilson (Ph.D.'86) moving into<br />\nhis lodgings a ramshackle rooming hourse near the original Hopkins<br />\ncampus where the Walters Art Gallery now squats. Over his bony<br />\nshoulder is slung a long canvas bag filled with hickory shafted golf<br />\nclubs and music from his Glee Club days at Princeton. Behind him a<br />\nporter carrying a large trunk on his back puffs his way up the narrow<br />\nstairs and manages to gasp, \"Is we here yet, Mistuh Wilson?\"<br />\n\"No, not quite,\" answers Woody (as his friends call him) with a<br />\npeculiar glint in his eyes that could only recall the twenty bricks he<br />\nhad packed in the trunk as a ruse on the aged blackamoor.<br />\nIn a matter of minutes they reach the loft where they find one<br />\nPhineas Beanstock (of the Boston Beanstocks) stretched lazily on<br />\nthe ostremoor. \"Do you wish to join me in a cup of tea, my dear<br />\nboy?\"<br />\n\"I don't think there's enough room for both us, you malicious<br />\nwiseacre,\" chortles Woody,\"and you, Jones, place that trunk in a safe<br />\nspot.''<br />\n\"Dere's no safe spot in Mobtown, Mistuh Wilson,\" grunts the<br />\nporter.<br />\n\"Oh dear me,\" sighs Woody, \"I am begining to think Baltimore is<br /><br />\nas barbarous as I thought it was. And 1 didn't bring an interpreter.<br />\nalong.\" And we last see Woody Wilson getting himself a cup of tea<br />\nand fortifying it with several jiggers of Jack Daniels.<br />\nThen there is the celebrated case of Frank \"Mugsy\" Muldoon (of<br />\nthe Southside Muldoons) who tried to sneak a still into his room in<br />\n1927, scarely a year after the Old dorms were opened. Mugsy had a<br />\ngood head for business and knew his sour mash enterprise would pay<br />\nfor his tuition many times over. Smuggling in the still was a very<br />\neasy matter; Mugsy painted the palms of the porters- with ten dollar<br />\nbills and slipped a Mickey Finn into the Dean's tea at an Orientation<br />\nluncheon. Let it be said that the class of '31 was the happiest on<br />\nrecord, despite the unfortunate Depression.<br />\nThe Big Band Era was in full swing when an awkward teenager<br />\nwith a foul mouth arrived from the wilds of West Baltimore to take<br />\nup residence in the dorms. His name was Spiro T. Agnew and his<br />\ncareer at Hopkins Lasted little more than a semester. From the start<br />\nit was obvious \"Teddy\" was a strange bird and unable to fit into the<br />\nHopkins ideal. On his very first day here, he called his fellow<br />\ndOrmmates \"impudent snobs, the motherfuckers,\" and complained<br />\nto anyone who would come close to him that there was no eatery in<br />\nthe immediate area that served tunafish milkshakes.<br />\nHappier days were in store for Hopkins as the calendar flipped to<br />\nthe fifties. The freshmen beanie was just large enough to contain the<br />\nconsciousness of the. typical Hopkins student, as the file on Otis<br />\nMcGuirk will show. Upon his arrival, Otis went into a tissy when he<br />\nlearned that Hopkins had no Civil Defense Plan, that the nearest<br />\nbomb shelter to the dorms was Gilman Hall. \"That's nearly two<br />\nhundred yards,\" the paranoid cried. Well, poor Otis couldn't take<br />\nthe anxiety and he left school after Thanksgiving to become a<br />\nconductor on the Philadelphia subway system.<br /><br />\nEJAYS*BLUEJAYS*BLU<br />\nA History of Homewood Sports<br />\nBy Andrew Cohen<br /><br />\nFor many years the game of Lacrosse has been<br />\nsynonymous with sports at Johns Hopkins. In<br />\nrecent years, though, strong finishes by the<br />\nbaseball, swimming, basketball, and soccer teams,<br />\nas well as new entries from the growing women's<br />\nathletic department have taken some of the<br />\nlimelight from the perennial contending laxers.<br /><br />\nL<br /><br />\nooking back, it was exactly 42 years ago<br />\nwhen Johns Hopkins began its first year with<br />\na collegiate sports program on the amateur<br />\nlevel. In doing so, they accepted the<br />\nphilosophy of the then University President<br />\nAmes who believed that college athletics<br />\nexisted for all students and not just the<br />\ntalented few. Up until 1935, Hopkins had<br />\nbeen part of the increasing<br />\ncommercialization of intercollegiate sports<br />\nby offering huge scholarships and guarantees<br />\nto star athletes and charging steep admission<br />\nrates to all spectators.<br />\nToday, according to Director of Athletics<br />\nRobert Scott, this philosophy of \"sports for<br />\nall\" remains central to the Hopkins program.<br />\nJohns Hopkins continues as one of the only<br />\nschools of its caliber not offering an athletic<br />\nscholarship program. It should also be noted<br />\nthat all Blue Jay sporting events, with the<br />\nexception of lacrosse, will go without an<br />\nadmission fee in 1977-78.<br />\nAnother major date was January, 1965,<br />\nthe month in which the Newton H. White<br />\nAthletic Center opened its doors to the<br />\nHopkins community. Named after Colonel<br />\nNewton White, a philanthropic friend of the<br />\nUniversity, the center has served as a focal<br />\npoint for all the athletic as well as much of<br />\nthe social life that has occured here over the<br />\npast 12 years. The Athletic Center continues<br />\nto be a meeting ground for all, open daily 10<br />\na.m.-10 p.m., Sundays, 1 p.m.-9 p.m.<br />\nOver the past ten years lacrosse has<br />\ndominated the Hopkins sports scene, and<br />\nrightfully so, due to its many successes. In<br />\n1968, Coach Robert Scott put together one<br />\nof the finest teams in Hopkin's illustrious lax<br />\nhistory. Led by all-American Downie<br />\nMcCarty, Phil Kneip, and Joe Cowan, the<br />\nJays ran roughshod over all opponents,<br />\ndefeating Maryland 10-8 in the<br />\nchampionship game. The 1969 season saw<br />\ndefensemen Mike Clark and Paul Weiss take<br />\ncharge, sending the Blue Jays to their second<br />\nstraight championship, this time sharing the<br />\nhonors with West Point.<br />\nAfter fighting off some lean years in '70<br />\nand '71 and losing in the final to Maryland<br />\nin '72 and '73 the Jays finally brought the<br />\ncrown back to Homewood with an<br />\nincredible 17-12 championship win over the<br />\nTerps in 1974. The Hopkins lax team came<br />\nclose to taking another championship just<br />\nlast year, but was overpowered by a strong<br />\nCornell team 16-8 in the season's finale.<br />\nThe exploits of the swimming team over<br />\nthe past few years have offered reasons for<br />\nstudent cheer. In 1970, under the reigns of<br />\nFrank Comfort, an outstanding coach who<br />\nhas since left for North Carolina, the<br />\nswimmers won the Middle Atlantic<br /><br />\nConference and Mason-Dixon<br />\nchampionships, defeating perennial winner<br />\nCatholic University. Since then, Blue Jay<br />\nswimmers have never failed to take these<br />\nchampionships and, in fact, have continued<br />\nto move forward in the NCAA College<br />\nDivision, taking that championship just last<br />\nyear. The list of individual all-Americans on<br />\nthe Jay squad continues to grow, with such<br />\nnames as Bill Milne, Mark Horning, Mike<br />\nBay, and Maria Mock.<br />\nThe Hopkins baseball team completed<br />\ntheir most successful season in history in<br />\n1977. For the first time the Blue Jay nine,<br />\nunder the guidance of coach Dennis Cox,<br />\nfinished first in the Southeast Division of the<br />\nMiddle Atlantic Conference, defeating a<br />\nhighly acclaimed Widener team in the finals<br />\nby the score of 2-1. Stars of both the<br />\nsuccessful 1976 and 1977 teams, Dave<br />\nEmala and Dave Lewing were named to the<br />\nAcademic all-American team of 1977. Emala<br />\nhas since been signed by the Baltimore<br />\nOrioles and is playing in the minor leagues.<br />\nRecent football at Hopkins reached its<br />\npeak under Coach Denny Cox from<br />\n1971-1973. In those seasons, led by Jack<br />\nThomas and Bill Nolan, the team posted<br />\nconsecutive 5-3 records with notable<br />\nvictories over arch rival Western Maryland.<br />\n1974-1977 saw the quality of play drop as<br />\nthe team ran up consecutive 3-5 records.<br />\nAccording to Coach Cox, though, the future<br />\nholds pleasant surprises.<br />\nSoccer at Hopkins was never considered<br />\nto be a significant sport until Coach Bob<br />\nOliver turned out a championship team in<br /><br />\n1976. Led by top scorers Greg Cunningham<br />\nand Joe Rutkowski and goalie Ken Seusse,<br />\nthe team compliled a record breaking 15-3-1<br />\nmark and was declared Middle Atlantic<br />\nSouthern Division Champions.<br />\nThe Blue Jay basketball team began to<br />\ntake shape when Coach Gary Rupert entered<br />\nthe scene in 1970. \"That championship<br />\nseason\" came in 1973-74 when the cagers<br />\ntook the Middle States championship with<br />\nan outstanding 17-7 record. Top scorer Bob<br />\nFriedman, key assist man John Rutter, and<br />\ntop rebounder Bill Jews,led the way.<br />\nOther varsity sports such as fencing,<br />\nwrestling, track and field, cross country, and<br />\ntennis have continued to offer fan interest<br />\nthroughout the past ten years.<br />\nA woman's program developed in 1971 by<br />\nDr. Joyce Hogan and now under the<br />\nleadership of Micul Morse has grown to the<br />\npoint where the women athletes of Hopkins<br />\nare today competing successfully in the areas<br />\nof fencing, tennis, swimming, squash,<br />\nbasketball, field hockey, and lacrosse. Such<br />\nfemale stars as olympic swimmer Maria<br />\nMock and junior olympic fencer Lori<br />\nKelleher have come up through the Hopkins<br />\nprogram.<br />\nIndeed Johns Hopkins has had a glorious<br />\nhistory in the athletic world. For along with<br />\nall the championships the University has<br />\ncollected, it has uniquely remained steadfast<br />\nin its philosophy that sports are for all to<br />\nenjoy and the University is not to be made,<br />\nas Dr. Wilson Shaffer wrote in his recent<br />\nbook, \"a pawn of promotional activities that<br />\nmake (them) simply public entertainment\".<br /><br />\nWelcome<br />\nNew and Returning Students<br /><br />\nMCAT<br /><br />\nYoung Adult Fellowship provides opportunities for Bible<br />\nstudies, worship, prayer meetings, picnics, social action, hikes,<br />\nsongfests, and whatever needs may be suggested.<br /><br />\nPREPARATION<br /><br />\n9:00 a.m. student-led worship<br />\n9:30 a.m. Bible study<br />\n11:00 a.m. worship<br />\nSunday Sept. 11 - Be our guest at lunch.

For example, this year,<br />\ntuition is $3750 for undergraduates, a rise of $250 over the<br />\npreceeding year. This is an increase of about 6%. Over the same<br />\nperiod, the estimated rate of inflation was also about 6%, so the<br />\nvalue of tuition this year is nearly the same as it was last year.<br />\nThe real dollar cost to Hopkins students and their families has<br />\nbeen close to level over the last decade. In 1966-67, tuition was<br />\n$1825. Measured in 1967 dollars, last year's cost ($3500) would<br />\namount to $1, 987, an increase of less than 1%. The real value of<br />\nHopkins' tuition has actually declined from a peak in 1971-72, when<br />\nthe fee of $2700 would have valued $2190 in 1967 dollars.<br />\nTuitiOn for 1978-79 is projected to be about $3950, with the<br />\nadministration holding the figure under $4000 until 1979-80. By the<br />\ntime today's freshmen are seniors, tuition will probably be about<br />\n$4500.<br /><br />\nAccording to Krueger, tuition is one of the first items determined<br />\nduring the annual Hopkins budget procedure. In addition to the<br />\nprojected inflation rate, competitiveness with other private<br />\nuniversities is considered before a final figure is reached. Other<br />\nprivate institutions around the country are feeling the same<br />\ninflationary squeeze. Indeed, Hopkins may hold the line In<br />\n1975-76, tuition here was $3300. Last year, it went to $3500, an<br />\nincrement of $200. Over the same period, tuition at Yale rose from<br />\n$4050 to $4400; at the University of Pennsylvania it soared from<br />\n$3790 to $4125; at Amherst, it increased from $3795 to $3975; and<br />\nat Tufts it went from $3550 to $3800.<br />\nThe amount of tuition charged is made with input from many<br />\npeople in the administration. Krueger describes it as \"one of the<br />\nhardest thought out decisions we make around here. We don't want<br />\nto be the front-runner with tuition increases, but we just can't afford<br />\nto lag.\"<br />\nYoung people today should not fear the astronomical costs<br />\nprojected for educating children in twenty years, says Krueger.<br />\n\"People's incomes today are not what they were ten years ago.<br />\nEducation still takes, and will still take, the same percentage of a<br />\nfamily's income..., student aid has also tried to keep up with higher<br />\ncosts.\"<br /><br />\nChristrnas Reservations<br />\nTake advantage of the special fares<br />\nnow available.
