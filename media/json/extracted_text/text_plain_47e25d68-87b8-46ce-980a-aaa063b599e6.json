A member of the team cannot do justice<br />\nto the team as a coach and also do credit to the<br />\nteam as a player; and, besides, a man playing<br />\non the team never has as much influence with<br />\nthe other members of the team as an outsider.<br />\nNor can much help at present be expected<br />\nfrom our alumni;for can a business man,a doctor, or a lawyer devote enough time to coaching<br />\na team regularly, even if he had the inclination? Why, certainly not.<br />\nYet there are at least a dozen of our alumni<br />\nin Baltimore who keep up with modern football<br />\nand who might come out once a week and<br />\ncoach a Hopkins football team. But any reasoner would say that this would not do, because<br />\neach man might be teaching the team different<br />\ntactics, and contradicting and undoing the<br />\nwork of his fellow coaches, thus mixing the<br />\nteam up worse than ever.<br />\nNow, my plan is to get around this very<br />\npoint. It is this: Let the captain of the team<br />\nchoose 9 or 10 of our alumni who know football, and ask them to act as a board of coaches,<br />\nand appoint or let the board appoint a chairman or head coach. This board, I am sure,<br />\ncould be gotten together three or four times<br />\nduring the first part of the season, and with<br />\nthe aid of the captain decide on the style of<br />\nplay the team should adopt; what men should<br />\ncompose the team; what teams should be<br />\nplayed and everything regarding the team's<br />\nplay. Then the members of the board could<br />\neach have different afternoons to come out on<br />\n<br />\nt.<br />\n<br />\nNo. 2<br />\n<br />\nthe field or in the cage to watch and supervise<br />\nthe play, each giving instruction in his own<br />\nway, but having all instruction go to the same<br />\nend\u2014namely, of perfecting the plans of the<br />\nboard of coaches.<br />\nIn thinking over some of our alumni footballists who would, no doubt, if properly approached, devote two or three hours a week<br />\nto our football team, I might name Dr. Sidney<br />\nCone, who played end on Pennsylvania; Dr.<br />\nJames F. Mitchell, one of the best line men<br />\nHopkins has ever had; Messrs. Lawrason<br />\nBrown, fullback on the fine '93 team; Harry<br />\nMarshall and Warrington Cottman, both of the<br />\n'93 team. On looking still farther back we see<br />\nMessrs. Johnson Poe and Riggs, both of whom<br />\nhave played on Princeton, and Allan McLane,<br />\na fullback in the old days. To this list might<br />\nbe added several others, including Dr. Paul<br />\nDashiell, the well-known athlete, who could,<br />\nI haven't a doubt, be induced to make a trip or<br />\ntwo from the Naval Academy to give the team<br />\n(and the board, for that matter) some of his<br />\nblackboard football talks, from which the<br />\nNaval Academy hustlers derive so much benefit.<br />\nOf course, men like these would not care to<br />\ncoach a team when only eight or nine of the<br />\nregular men show up each afternoon, or when<br />\nlittle attention is given to their coaching ; so<br />\nthe team would have to do its part before anyone could expect such men to take the scheme<br />\nin hand.<br />\nIf this plan could be worked up, I do not see<br />\nwhy the Hopkins football team could not derive some advantage from being in a city where<br />\nthe coaches could be procured to counterbalance some of the many disadvantages that the<br />\ncity presents, and in time establish a system of<br />\ncoaching which could apply to all Hopkins<br />\nteams, and could be perpetuated by the everincreasing Baltimore alumni.<br />\n<br />\nG. CANBY ROBINSON, '99.<br />\n<br />\n\f2<br />\n<br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\n<br />\nCollege Congress Organized.<br />\nThe organization of the Johns Hopkins<br />\nCongress has been effected. Senators and congressmen now expatiate on the advantages to<br />\nbe gained from this bill and that resolution.<br />\nEverywhere within the limits of the undergraduate department the shades of future statesmen<br />\nare visible.<br />\nThe House of Representatives, consisting of<br />\nthe members of the junior class, was organized<br />\nWednesday, October 13. The meeting was<br />\ncalled to order by the \"Censor,\" Mr. Guy<br />\nCarleton Lee. The constitution and by-laws<br />\ngoverning this body were read and adopted,<br />\nand officers were elected. Mr. French was<br />\nelected speaker, Mr. Grimes speaker pro tern.<br />\nand Mr. Fooks sergeant-at-arms. Mr. Spillman and Mr. Knapp were appointed by the<br />\nspeaker to serve as clerks for the meeting. The<br />\nsubject to be debated at the next meeting \u2014<br />\n\"Resolved, That city government be independent of national party lines\"\u2014was given out and<br />\ndebaters chosen. The affirmative side will be<br />\ntaken by Messrs. Ver Planck, Hanna, Harry<br />\nand Homer; that of the negative by Grimes,<br />\nJoyner, Small and Gemmill. The meeting then<br />\nadjourned.<br />\nMr. Lee met the members of '98 on last<br />\nWednesday. They form the Senate. The Senate, it was fully explained, is to occupy much<br />\nthe same relation to the House (composed of<br />\n'99 men) as exists between the two houses in<br />\nWashington. Extemporaneous speeches will<br />\nbe the principal work of the Senate, although<br />\nsome prepared work will be required. In the<br />\nHouse the prepared debates will be the chief requirement, with voluntary addresses as a secondary consideration.<br />\nThere was a full attendance at the opening<br />\nsession of the Senate. Several graduate students were present. Mr. Lee read the constitution for the government of the body, which<br />\nwas adopted. The Senate and the House meet<br />\nbi-weekly. The House assembled yesterday;<br />\nthe Senate will convene next Wednesday.<br />\n<br />\nOfficers were chosen without nominations as<br />\nfollows: President, Albert C. Dieffenbach ;<br />\nvice-president, Edgeworth Smith; sergeantat arms, Powhatan J. Wooldridge. President<br />\nDieffenbach appointed George B. Scholl secretary and Frank J. Clunet reading clerk of the<br />\nmeeting. In an address to the Senate the president pointed out the necessity of handling<br />\nwith care the bills sent up from the lower house.<br />\nThere will be at Easter a public debate between<br />\nrepresentatives of the two houses. Handsome<br />\nprizes will be given, and, it is believed, the<br />\nevent will be a notable one.<br />\nIn the Senate the subject for debate for the<br />\ncoming meeting is : \"Resolved, That city government be independent of national party<br />\nlines.\" Senators V. E. Smith, Renouf and<br />\nLucke have the affirmative, and Senators Pyle,<br />\nYoung and Hirshberg the negative.<br />\n<br />\nY. M. C. A.

Besides the pleasure<br />\nof seeing one's work in print, there is a distinct<br />\nadvantage, for the student who wishes to do<br />\ngood work, in the opportunity to criticise his<br />\nown writing in the same form as the literature<br />\nhe reads every day.<br />\nTHE NEWS - LETTER, therefore, asks for<br />\ncompositions in prose and verse. It seeks to<br />\nencourage real, honest efforts to make good<br />\nliterature. To this end the staff offers two<br />\nprizes of $io each\u2014one for the best collection<br />\nof verses not exceeding thirty lines, and the<br />\nother for the best short story of not less than<br />\ni,000 nor more than 2,000 words.<br />\nFurther particulars in regard to the competition are given in another column.<br />\n<br />\nLITERARY WORK AT HOPKINS.:<br />\n<br />\nThe new cage and gymnasium are nearing<br />\ncompletion, and we expect from them a great<br />\nadvance in Hopkins athletics. The College<br />\nCongress is now fully organized, and we look<br />\nforward to great things in oratory. Both these<br />\nmovements were made because it was recognized that we were deficient in athletics and<br />\npublic speaking. Now and then we hear comparisons little to \u2022our advantage between the<br />\nliterary work done here and in some of the<br />\nlarge colleges and universities in the North.<br />\nIt is true, perhaps, that in this particular, too,<br />\nwe are weak. Our course in English composition is thorough, but it does not have a very<br />\nprominent place in the curriculum. The average student writes only what he must, and that,<br />\nif he would do it well, under pressure for time.<br />\nBeyond the first year he finds no opportunity<br />\nfor university work in composition, and no incentive for private effort. Such an outlook offers little encouragement to a plea for more<br />\nliterary work. And yet THE NEWS-LETTER<br />\ndoes make such a plea. It undertakes to provide some incentive for good work and a medium for its publication.<br />\n<br />\nrOOTBALL.<br />\nAlthough we have made our first trial of<br />\nstrength of the season on the gridiron and have<br />\ncome off only second best ; and though the victorious team represented a college which in<br />\nprevious years had generally proved \"easy\"<br />\nfor us ; yet, if we take all the circumstances of<br />\nthe case into account, the result of the Haverford game should be distinctly encouraging to<br />\nus. Lack of practice proved a great handicap,<br />\nand much of our weakness was d u e to<br />\nthis cause. A considerable difference in weight<br />\nwas also against us. But, in spite of the<br />\nhandicaps, we played a fast and plucky game,<br />\nand not a few brilliant plays were made. If the<br />\nweight of the team should be increased by the<br />\naccession of a few of the heavy-weights so plentiful among the graduates and at the Medical<br />\nSchool ; if the team continues to practice faithfully; and, most important of all, if a good<br />\nscrub can be organized to play the 'Varsity,<br />\nHopkins should make a much better showing<br />\nin football than she has done for several years<br />\npast.<br />\n<br />\n\fTHE NEWS-LETTE R.<br />\n<br />\nLACROSSE.<br />\nThe refusal of Maddren to accept a re-election as captain of the lacrosse team is a great<br />\ndisappointment. His work last year in turning<br />\na crowd of novices into one of the strongest<br />\ncollege teams in the country led us to hope for<br />\nstill greater results from his direction in the<br />\ncoming year. The press of his work at the<br />\nMedical School compelled him to resign the<br />\ncaptaincy. He will, however, play on the team<br />\nand give as much of his time as possible to<br />\ncoaching it.<br />\nCaptain Robinson, who succeeds him, was<br />\nfirst attack on last year's team. He played a<br />\nsteady, reliable game throughout the \u2022season,<br />\nand is also thoroughly acquainted with the theory of the game.<br />\nOn Saturday, October 16, The Baltimore<br />\nNews devoted two-thirds of a column on the<br />\neditorial page to the first number of THE<br />\nNEWS-LETTER.

REIZENSTE1N'S APPOINTrIENT.<br />\n<br />\nDr. Milton Reizenstein, who has been serving as sociological expert for the Baron de<br />\nHirsch fund, has lately prepared a report recommending the removal into the country districts of the congested masses of Russian Jews<br />\nnow living in the notorious Ghetto of New<br />\nYork City. It is estimated that 50,000 Hebrews will be benefited directly, though it is<br />\nnot the purpose of the managers that the<br />\nmoney shall be distributed as charity.<br />\n<br />\n5<br />\n<br />\nBesides the depopulation of the Ghetto, the<br />\nmain features in the plans are the location of<br />\ntrade schools and a non-sectarian home for<br />\ngirls. These measures will be conducted on a<br />\ngigantic plan, as $2,000,000 have been contributed by Baron de Hirsch for the cause.<br />\nFriends of the University will be interested<br />\nto know that such an important position, carrying with it the practical disposition of such a<br />\nlarge sum has been given to a former student of<br />\nthe University.<br />\n<br />\nTHE MEDICAL SCHOOL.<br />\nDr. H.(in Ostrology): \"I think that I have<br />\nsaid all that is necessary concerning the coccyx ; there is no need of going further into<br />\nde-tail.\"<br />\nThe tennis courts in the yard of the Cenatornical Laboratory have been repaired, and we<br />\nget occasional glimpses of white-trousered<br />\nmen taking a little healthful exercise after the<br />\nconfining work in the laboratory.<br />\nThe first group of dissectors of the first year<br />\ncommenced their work on Wednesday.

The game was played at the<br />\nMaryland Oval. Rain had been falling all the<br />\nmorning,and in consequence the grounds were<br />\na mass of mud, with here and there a miniature<br />\nlake outspread. There were four of these lakes<br />\non the grounds in which the contestants<br />\nplunged boldly in pursuit of the coveted<br />\nspheroid.<br />\nAt 3.15 o'clock Armstrong kicked off for<br />\nHopkins. The ball was downed on Haverford's<br />\nthirty-yard line. Then by steady rushes between tackle and end Haverford carried the<br />\nball across the field, finally scoring a touchdown by a twenty-five-yard run Hopkins'<br />\nleft end. This was nine minutes after play began. The goal was missed.<br />\nFor the rest of the half no further scoring<br />\nwas done, although Hopkins had one close<br />\nshave. Near the end of the half, with only<br />\ntwenty-five seconds to play, Haverford had the<br />\nball on Hopkins' one-yard line. Haverford<br />\ntried centre. The two teams swayed like a<br />\npendulum toward Hopkins' line, and it seemed<br />\nas if Haverford's superior weight would win.<br />\nBut, no! As if by superhuman effort, the mass<br />\nof players swayed back again, and by dint of<br />\nHopkins' pluck and muscle the ball was<br />\ndowned on the one-yard line. The half was<br />\nover.<br />\nIt had been noticed by this time that Hopkins had several defects in her line. The backs,<br />\nas yet, had not had a chance to run with the<br />\nball, so could not be accurately judged. The<br />\nindividual work of many of the men had been of<br />\na high order. But one man's strength was<br />\ncounterbalanced by another's weakness. One<br />\ncould not depend on his neighbor. However,<br />\nthe weakness lay more in lack of practice and<br />\nteam inexperience than in the calibre of the<br />\nplayers. The second half, indeed, showed better the quality of our boys than did the first.<br />\n<br />\nHaverford kicked off to Cabrera, who advanced the ball to Hopkins' forty-yard line before he was downed. Then the ball alternated<br />\nbetween Hopkins and Haverford. Hopkins'<br />\nline and ends were playing a plucky game and<br />\ntime and again the ball was given to Hopkins<br />\non downs. Here the Hopkins backs showed<br />\ntheir weakness in an utter inability to advance<br />\nthe ball, Hopkins depending on her strong<br />\npunting to hold her own. Finally Haverford<br />\nblocked a kick and made a touchdown. Goal<br />\nwas kicked.<br />\nScore: Hopkins o, Haverford 10.<br />\nThe game was called a few minutes later<br />\nwith the ball in Haverford's territory.,<br />\nThe defensive work of the 'Varsity team was<br />\nrather a surprise, while the work back of the<br />\nline was poor, although a fair idea could not be<br />\nformed on account of the wretched condition of<br />\nthe grounds. Our backs could get no foothold,<br />\nand therefore could not get started quickly.<br />\nOn Saturday, October 16, Haverford played<br />\nDickinson, and was defeated 6 to 5, Dickinson scoring her touchdown in the latter<br />\npart of t h e last half by breaking the line.<br />\nOn Wednesday, October 20, Lehigh defeated<br />\nDickinson 5 to o by a lucky goal from the field,<br />\nalthough she was plainly outplayed by the latter, the ball being continually in her territory.<br />\nThis seems to place the Johns Hopkins University in a good light, as her weakness was<br />\nmainly due to lack of practice.<br />\n<br />\nBASEBALL.<br />\nMuch cannot be said in regard to baseball<br />\nmatters thus early in the season. Haulenbeek<br />\nand Clarke have been elected, respectively,<br />\nmanager and captain of the team for '98. Manager Haulenbeek thinks that some good material may be lurking within the baseball fold<br />\nof freshmen, but as yet it has not made its appearance. The old men have all signified their<br />\nwillingness to play on the team. Grimes will<br />\ntry for short.<br />\nManager Haulenbeek is contemplating an<br />\nelaborate schedule, and has started out well in<br />\n<br />\n\fTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\nsecuring a game with Harvard. This game<br />\nwill be played here, and the 'Varsity team<br />\nshould make a good showing, as it will have<br />\nthe benefit of cage practice.<br />\nTRACK TEAM<br />\n<br />\nThe track team which will compete in the<br />\nGeorgetown games is rapidly getting into condition. Several scalps should hang from the<br />\nbelts of the 'Varsity men when they return.<br />\nRobert Garrett has consented to wear the black<br />\nand blue on this occasion. He will enter the<br />\ndiscus-throwing contest and the broad jump.<br />\nGeorge B. Scholl will enter the jumps. George<br />\nW. Knapp, Jr., the holder of the thirty-fiveyard championship of Maryland, and J. Morfit<br />\nMullen, Hopkins' champion quarter mile<br />\nsprinter, will enter the runs. The team is practicing regularly at Maryland Oval.<br />\nArmstrong made good gains by his successful punts. Only on one occasion was his<br />\nkick blocked.<br />\nBrady was a tower of strength at the end,<br />\nbreaking up interference and tackling extremely well. Only twice were gains made<br />\naround his end.<br />\nRobinson played an exceptionally steady<br />\ngame throughout, and his tackling saved much<br />\nground for Hopkins.<br />\nGuggenheimer made some good gains<br />\nthrough the line, and Captain Hodges also deserves commendation for his work.<br />\nHaverford used a peculiar and very effective<br />\nform of interference. It consisted of playing<br />\nthe ends back of the line and next to quarter,<br />\nthus giving great compactness, and a force almost irresistible on such slippery ground, to<br />\nall plays around the ends.<br />\nThe Western High School of Washington<br />\nhas challenged the Hopkins scrub for a<br />\ngame<br />\nearly in November.

A member of the team cannot do justice<br />\nto the team as a coach and also do credit to the<br />\nteam as a player; and, besides, a man playing<br />\non the team never has as much influence with<br />\nthe other members of the team as an outsider.<br />\nNor can much help at present be expected<br />\nfrom our alumni;for can a business man,a doctor, or a lawyer devote enough time to coaching<br />\na team regularly, even if he had the inclination? Why, certainly not.<br />\nYet there are at least a dozen of our alumni<br />\nin Baltimore who keep up with modern football<br />\nand who might come out once a week and<br />\ncoach a Hopkins football team. But any reasoner would say that this would not do, because<br />\neach man might be teaching the team different<br />\ntactics, and contradicting and undoing the<br />\nwork of his fellow coaches, thus mixing the<br />\nteam up worse than ever.<br />\nNow, my plan is to get around this very<br />\npoint. It is this: Let the captain of the team<br />\nchoose 9 or 10 of our alumni who know football, and ask them to act as a board of coaches,<br />\nand appoint or let the board appoint a chairman or head coach. This board, I am sure,<br />\ncould be gotten together three or four times<br />\nduring the first part of the season, and with<br />\nthe aid of the captain decide on the style of<br />\nplay the team should adopt; what men should<br />\ncompose the team; what teams should be<br />\nplayed and everything regarding the team's<br />\nplay. Then the members of the board could<br />\neach have different afternoons to come out on<br /><br />\nt.<br /><br />\nNo. 2<br /><br />\nthe field or in the cage to watch and supervise<br />\nthe play, each giving instruction in his own<br />\nway, but having all instruction go to the same<br />\nend\u2014namely, of perfecting the plans of the<br />\nboard of coaches.<br />\nIn thinking over some of our alumni footballists who would, no doubt, if properly approached, devote two or three hours a week<br />\nto our football team, I might name Dr. Sidney<br />\nCone, who played end on Pennsylvania; Dr.<br />\nJames F. Mitchell, one of the best line men<br />\nHopkins has ever had; Messrs. Lawrason<br />\nBrown, fullback on the fine '93 team; Harry<br />\nMarshall and Warrington Cottman, both of the<br />\n'93 team. On looking still farther back we see<br />\nMessrs. Johnson Poe and Riggs, both of whom<br />\nhave played on Princeton, and Allan McLane,<br />\na fullback in the old days. To this list might<br />\nbe added several others, including Dr. Paul<br />\nDashiell, the well-known athlete, who could,<br />\nI haven't a doubt, be induced to make a trip or<br />\ntwo from the Naval Academy to give the team<br />\n(and the board, for that matter) some of his<br />\nblackboard football talks, from which the<br />\nNaval Academy hustlers derive so much benefit.<br />\nOf course, men like these would not care to<br />\ncoach a team when only eight or nine of the<br />\nregular men show up each afternoon, or when<br />\nlittle attention is given to their coaching ; so<br />\nthe team would have to do its part before anyone could expect such men to take the scheme<br />\nin hand.<br />\nIf this plan could be worked up, I do not see<br />\nwhy the Hopkins football team could not derive some advantage from being in a city where<br />\nthe coaches could be procured to counterbalance some of the many disadvantages that the<br />\ncity presents, and in time establish a system of<br />\ncoaching which could apply to all Hopkins<br />\nteams, and could be perpetuated by the everincreasing Baltimore alumni.<br /><br />\nG. CANBY ROBINSON, '99.<br /><br />\n2<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br /><br />\nCollege Congress Organized.<br />\nThe organization of the Johns Hopkins<br />\nCongress has been effected. Senators and congressmen now expatiate on the advantages to<br />\nbe gained from this bill and that resolution.<br />\nEverywhere within the limits of the undergraduate department the shades of future statesmen<br />\nare visible.<br />\nThe House of Representatives, consisting of<br />\nthe members of the junior class, was organized<br />\nWednesday, October 13. The meeting was<br />\ncalled to order by the \"Censor,\" Mr. Guy<br />\nCarleton Lee. The constitution and by-laws<br />\ngoverning this body were read and adopted,<br />\nand officers were elected. Mr. French was<br />\nelected speaker, Mr. Grimes speaker pro tern.<br />\nand Mr. Fooks sergeant-at-arms. Mr. Spillman and Mr. Knapp were appointed by the<br />\nspeaker to serve as clerks for the meeting. The<br />\nsubject to be debated at the next meeting \u2014<br />\n\"Resolved, That city government be independent of national party lines\"\u2014was given out and<br />\ndebaters chosen. The affirmative side will be<br />\ntaken by Messrs. Ver Planck, Hanna, Harry<br />\nand Homer; that of the negative by Grimes,<br />\nJoyner, Small and Gemmill. The meeting then<br />\nadjourned.<br />\nMr. Lee met the members of '98 on last<br />\nWednesday. They form the Senate. The Senate, it was fully explained, is to occupy much<br />\nthe same relation to the House (composed of<br />\n'99 men) as exists between the two houses in<br />\nWashington. Extemporaneous speeches will<br />\nbe the principal work of the Senate, although<br />\nsome prepared work will be required. In the<br />\nHouse the prepared debates will be the chief requirement, with voluntary addresses as a secondary consideration.<br />\nThere was a full attendance at the opening<br />\nsession of the Senate. Several graduate students were present. Mr. Lee read the constitution for the government of the body, which<br />\nwas adopted. The Senate and the House meet<br />\nbi-weekly. The House assembled yesterday;<br />\nthe Senate will convene next Wednesday.<br /><br />\nOfficers were chosen without nominations as<br />\nfollows: President, Albert C. Dieffenbach ;<br />\nvice-president, Edgeworth Smith; sergeantat arms, Powhatan J. Wooldridge. President<br />\nDieffenbach appointed George B. Scholl secretary and Frank J. Clunet reading clerk of the<br />\nmeeting. In an address to the Senate the president pointed out the necessity of handling<br />\nwith care the bills sent up from the lower house.<br />\nThere will be at Easter a public debate between<br />\nrepresentatives of the two houses. Handsome<br />\nprizes will be given, and, it is believed, the<br />\nevent will be a notable one.<br />\nIn the Senate the subject for debate for the<br />\ncoming meeting is : \"Resolved, That city government be independent of national party<br />\nlines.\" Senators V. E. Smith, Renouf and<br />\nLucke have the affirmative, and Senators Pyle,<br />\nYoung and Hirshberg the negative.<br /><br />\nY. M. C. A.

Besides the pleasure<br />\nof seeing one's work in print, there is a distinct<br />\nadvantage, for the student who wishes to do<br />\ngood work, in the opportunity to criticise his<br />\nown writing in the same form as the literature<br />\nhe reads every day.<br />\nTHE NEWS - LETTER, therefore, asks for<br />\ncompositions in prose and verse. It seeks to<br />\nencourage real, honest efforts to make good<br />\nliterature. To this end the staff offers two<br />\nprizes of $io each\u2014one for the best collection<br />\nof verses not exceeding thirty lines, and the<br />\nother for the best short story of not less than<br />\ni,000 nor more than 2,000 words.<br />\nFurther particulars in regard to the competition are given in another column.<br /><br />\nLITERARY WORK AT HOPKINS.:<br /><br />\nThe new cage and gymnasium are nearing<br />\ncompletion, and we expect from them a great<br />\nadvance in Hopkins athletics. The College<br />\nCongress is now fully organized, and we look<br />\nforward to great things in oratory. Both these<br />\nmovements were made because it was recognized that we were deficient in athletics and<br />\npublic speaking. Now and then we hear comparisons little to \u2022our advantage between the<br />\nliterary work done here and in some of the<br />\nlarge colleges and universities in the North.<br />\nIt is true, perhaps, that in this particular, too,<br />\nwe are weak. Our course in English composition is thorough, but it does not have a very<br />\nprominent place in the curriculum. The average student writes only what he must, and that,<br />\nif he would do it well, under pressure for time.<br />\nBeyond the first year he finds no opportunity<br />\nfor university work in composition, and no incentive for private effort. Such an outlook offers little encouragement to a plea for more<br />\nliterary work. And yet THE NEWS-LETTER<br />\ndoes make such a plea. It undertakes to provide some incentive for good work and a medium for its publication.<br /><br />\nrOOTBALL.<br />\nAlthough we have made our first trial of<br />\nstrength of the season on the gridiron and have<br />\ncome off only second best ; and though the victorious team represented a college which in<br />\nprevious years had generally proved \"easy\"<br />\nfor us ; yet, if we take all the circumstances of<br />\nthe case into account, the result of the Haverford game should be distinctly encouraging to<br />\nus. Lack of practice proved a great handicap,<br />\nand much of our weakness was d u e to<br />\nthis cause. A considerable difference in weight<br />\nwas also against us. But, in spite of the<br />\nhandicaps, we played a fast and plucky game,<br />\nand not a few brilliant plays were made. If the<br />\nweight of the team should be increased by the<br />\naccession of a few of the heavy-weights so plentiful among the graduates and at the Medical<br />\nSchool ; if the team continues to practice faithfully; and, most important of all, if a good<br />\nscrub can be organized to play the 'Varsity,<br />\nHopkins should make a much better showing<br />\nin football than she has done for several years<br />\npast.<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTE R.<br /><br />\nLACROSSE.<br />\nThe refusal of Maddren to accept a re-election as captain of the lacrosse team is a great<br />\ndisappointment. His work last year in turning<br />\na crowd of novices into one of the strongest<br />\ncollege teams in the country led us to hope for<br />\nstill greater results from his direction in the<br />\ncoming year. The press of his work at the<br />\nMedical School compelled him to resign the<br />\ncaptaincy. He will, however, play on the team<br />\nand give as much of his time as possible to<br />\ncoaching it.<br />\nCaptain Robinson, who succeeds him, was<br />\nfirst attack on last year's team. He played a<br />\nsteady, reliable game throughout the \u2022season,<br />\nand is also thoroughly acquainted with the theory of the game.<br />\nOn Saturday, October 16, The Baltimore<br />\nNews devoted two-thirds of a column on the<br />\neditorial page to the first number of THE<br />\nNEWS-LETTER. In addition to characterizing<br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER as the University's bright<br />\npaper, The News reprinted the article on the<br />\ncage in full, made reference to the editorial on<br />\nathletics and published an extract from the<br />\narticle on the Congress.<br />\nThe plan for a system of coaching which<br />\nheads the column of this issue seems quite feasible, and should, if adopted, give good results.<br />\nIt is to be hoped that this suggestion may bear<br />\nfruit. The Athletic Association would do well<br />\nto give it careful consideration.<br />\nDR. REIZENSTE1N'S APPOINTrIENT.<br /><br />\nDr. Milton Reizenstein, who has been serving as sociological expert for the Baron de<br />\nHirsch fund, has lately prepared a report recommending the removal into the country districts of the congested masses of Russian Jews<br />\nnow living in the notorious Ghetto of New<br />\nYork City. It is estimated that 50,000 Hebrews will be benefited directly, though it is<br />\nnot the purpose of the managers that the<br />\nmoney shall be distributed as charity.<br /><br />\n5<br /><br />\nBesides the depopulation of the Ghetto, the<br />\nmain features in the plans are the location of<br />\ntrade schools and a non-sectarian home for<br />\ngirls. These measures will be conducted on a<br />\ngigantic plan, as $2,000,000 have been contributed by Baron de Hirsch for the cause.<br />\nFriends of the University will be interested<br />\nto know that such an important position, carrying with it the practical disposition of such a<br />\nlarge sum has been given to a former student of<br />\nthe University.<br /><br />\nTHE MEDICAL SCHOOL.<br />\nDr. H.(in Ostrology): \"I think that I have<br />\nsaid all that is necessary concerning the coccyx ; there is no need of going further into<br />\nde-tail.\"<br />\nThe tennis courts in the yard of the Cenatornical Laboratory have been repaired, and we<br />\nget occasional glimpses of white-trousered<br />\nmen taking a little healthful exercise after the<br />\nconfining work in the laboratory.<br />\nThe first group of dissectors of the first year<br />\ncommenced their work on Wednesday.

There were four of these lakes<br />\non the grounds in which the contestants<br />\nplunged boldly in pursuit of the coveted<br />\nspheroid.<br />\nAt 3.15 o'clock Armstrong kicked off for<br />\nHopkins. The ball was downed on Haverford's<br />\nthirty-yard line. Then by steady rushes between tackle and end Haverford carried the<br />\nball across the field, finally scoring a touchdown by a twenty-five-yard run Hopkins'<br />\nleft end. This was nine minutes after play began. The goal was missed.<br />\nFor the rest of the half no further scoring<br />\nwas done, although Hopkins had one close<br />\nshave. Near the end of the half, with only<br />\ntwenty-five seconds to play, Haverford had the<br />\nball on Hopkins' one-yard line. Haverford<br />\ntried centre. The two teams swayed like a<br />\npendulum toward Hopkins' line, and it seemed<br />\nas if Haverford's superior weight would win.<br />\nBut, no! As if by superhuman effort, the mass<br />\nof players swayed back again, and by dint of<br />\nHopkins' pluck and muscle the ball was<br />\ndowned on the one-yard line. The half was<br />\nover.<br />\nIt had been noticed by this time that Hopkins had several defects in her line. The backs,<br />\nas yet, had not had a chance to run with the<br />\nball, so could not be accurately judged. The<br />\nindividual work of many of the men had been of<br />\na high order. But one man's strength was<br />\ncounterbalanced by another's weakness. One<br />\ncould not depend on his neighbor. However,<br />\nthe weakness lay more in lack of practice and<br />\nteam inexperience than in the calibre of the<br />\nplayers. The second half, indeed, showed better the quality of our boys than did the first.<br /><br />\nHaverford kicked off to Cabrera, who advanced the ball to Hopkins' forty-yard line before he was downed. Then the ball alternated<br />\nbetween Hopkins and Haverford. Hopkins'<br />\nline and ends were playing a plucky game and<br />\ntime and again the ball was given to Hopkins<br />\non downs. Here the Hopkins backs showed<br />\ntheir weakness in an utter inability to advance<br />\nthe ball, Hopkins depending on her strong<br />\npunting to hold her own. Finally Haverford<br />\nblocked a kick and made a touchdown. Goal<br />\nwas kicked.<br />\nScore: Hopkins o, Haverford 10.<br />\nThe game was called a few minutes later<br />\nwith the ball in Haverford's territory.,<br />\nThe defensive work of the 'Varsity team was<br />\nrather a surprise, while the work back of the<br />\nline was poor, although a fair idea could not be<br />\nformed on account of the wretched condition of<br />\nthe grounds. Our backs could get no foothold,<br />\nand therefore could not get started quickly.<br />\nOn Saturday, October 16, Haverford played<br />\nDickinson, and was defeated 6 to 5, Dickinson scoring her touchdown in the latter<br />\npart of t h e last half by breaking the line.<br />\nOn Wednesday, October 20, Lehigh defeated<br />\nDickinson 5 to o by a lucky goal from the field,<br />\nalthough she was plainly outplayed by the latter, the ball being continually in her territory.<br />\nThis seems to place the Johns Hopkins University in a good light, as her weakness was<br />\nmainly due to lack of practice.<br /><br />\nBASEBALL.<br />\nMuch cannot be said in regard to baseball<br />\nmatters thus early in the season. Haulenbeek<br />\nand Clarke have been elected, respectively,<br />\nmanager and captain of the team for '98. Manager Haulenbeek thinks that some good material may be lurking within the baseball fold<br />\nof freshmen, but as yet it has not made its appearance. The old men have all signified their<br />\nwillingness to play on the team. Grimes will<br />\ntry for short.<br />\nManager Haulenbeek is contemplating an<br />\nelaborate schedule, and has started out well in<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\nsecuring a game with Harvard. This game<br />\nwill be played here, and the 'Varsity team<br />\nshould make a good showing, as it will have<br />\nthe benefit of cage practice.<br />\nTRACK TEAM<br /><br />\nThe track team which will compete in the<br />\nGeorgetown games is rapidly getting into condition. Several scalps should hang from the<br />\nbelts of the 'Varsity men when they return.<br />\nRobert Garrett has consented to wear the black<br />\nand blue on this occasion. He will enter the<br />\ndiscus-throwing contest and the broad jump.<br />\nGeorge B. Scholl will enter the jumps. George<br />\nW. Knapp, Jr., the holder of the thirty-fiveyard championship of Maryland, and J. Morfit<br />\nMullen, Hopkins' champion quarter mile<br />\nsprinter, will enter the runs. The team is practicing regularly at Maryland Oval.<br />\nArmstrong made good gains by his successful punts. Only on one occasion was his<br />\nkick blocked.<br />\nBrady was a tower of strength at the end,<br />\nbreaking up interference and tackling extremely well. Only twice were gains made<br />\naround his end.<br />\nRobinson played an exceptionally steady<br />\ngame throughout, and his tackling saved much<br />\nground for Hopkins.<br />\nGuggenheimer made some good gains<br />\nthrough the line, and Captain Hodges also deserves commendation for his work.<br />\nHaverford used a peculiar and very effective<br />\nform of interference. It consisted of playing<br />\nthe ends back of the line and next to quarter,<br />\nthus giving great compactness, and a force almost irresistible on such slippery ground, to<br />\nall plays around the ends.<br />\nThe Western High School of Washington<br />\nhas challenged the Hopkins scrub for a<br />\ngame<br />\nearly in November.
