Whiting School of<br />\nEngineering has begun the process of seeking national accreditation for most of the academic<br />\ndepartments offering Bachelor<br />\nof Engineering Science' degrees.<br />\nIn anticipation of future<br />\naccreditation possibilities, - the<br />\nBioengineering<br />\nprogram has<br />\nchanged its name to Biomedical<br />\nEngineering while at the same<br />\ntime, the Committee-run program has been replaced by its<br />\nown separate department. Most<br />\nof the professors who served on<br />\nthe original committee were<br />\nfaculty members from the<br />\nHopkins School of Medicine.<br />\nWith the establishment of a<br />\nseparate department at Homewood, many professors will now<br />\nhold joint appointments -with<br />\nother departments at Homewood or with the Medical<br />\nInstitutions. Dean of Faculty of<br />\nEngineering David Vande Linde<br />\nexplained, \"the separate department will only helpstrengthen<br />\nthe present program.This fall, the Accrediting<br />\nBoard for Engineering and Technology (ABEAT) - a consortium of professional societies<br />\n<br />\npreviously called the Engineering<br />\nCouncil for Professional Development - will begin reviewing<br />\nthe programs in the departments<br />\nof Mechanics, Materials Science,<br />\nand Electrical Engineering - one<br />\nHopkins department that has<br />\nbeen accredited since the establishment of the engineering<br />\naccrediting boards.<br />\nUnder the guidelines set<br />\n<br />\nforth by ABEAT, all students<br />\nmust satisfy certain distribution<br />\nrequirements: a minimum num,<br />\nber of credits in the non-engineering disciplines and a set<br />\nnumber of credit hours in design<br />\ncourses and basic sciences.<br />\nMoreover, a department under<br />\nconsideration for accreditation<br />\nmust have at least some upperclass students in the current<br />\n<br />\nseniors are receiving,\" for there<br />\nprogram.<br />\nFor this reason and because must be some \"evolutionary<br />\nof the name change, the Bio- changes\" to make a program<br />\nmedical Engineering Department into an accreditable one.

Under his direction, CBI contributed to the<br />\nunderstanding of the marine<br />\norganisms in the Bay and helped<br />\ndevelop the new fields of ecology and environmental science.<br />\n<br />\nAccording to George Fisher,<br />\nchairman of the Department of<br />\nEarth and Planetary Sciences, in<br />\n1969 the Department of Oceanography, the Department of<br />\nGeology and several people<br />\ninterested in geography ,and<br />\nmechanics came together to<br />\nform the Department of Earth<br />\nand Planetary Sciences.

In 1970, 15 percent of<br />\nRemington's people lived below<br />\nthe federally defined poverty<br />\nlevel (S6,600 a year for a family<br />\nof four) and 80 percent hadn't<br />\nfinished high school. Today<br />\nvery few even begin; the dropout<br />\nrate is up around 9 out of 10.<br />\nThere is a shrinking job pool and<br />\nconsiderable racial tension where<br />\ncontact exists.

One<br />\nrelatively new organization in<br />\n<br />\nRemington is the four-year-old<br />\nCommunity Survival Center at<br />\n207 W. 25th Street, founded in<br />\nOctober 1977 by Tom Culotta<br />\nand a group of young Remingtonians.<br />\nAccording to its<br />\ndirector it was conceived with<br />\nthe philosophy of \"community<br />\ncontrol through collectivization- it aims to create a broadly<br />\nbased grass roots organization in<br />\norder to promote self-development and greater participation in<br />\nmaking the decisions which<br />\nvitally affect the area's people.<br />\nThe activities of the Center are<br />\ndesigned to address and resolve<br />\nsocial, educational and economic<br />\nproblems which are destructive<br />\nforces in the community.<br />\nThe problems facing Remington overlap to a great extent.<br />\nAccording to Culotta, the area's<br />\neconomic disability is the product, at least in part, of its<br />\ncont. on p. 7<br />\n<br />\n\fPAGE 2 SEPTEMBER 25,, 1981<br />\n<br />\nCommunity Notes<br />\nBY SUNITA HANJURA<br />\n<br />\ncommenkily<br />\nPSU Marches On Washington<br />\nBY MARK TRACHTENBERG<br />\n<br />\nGHCC Opposes GAM<br />\nAt its first meeting since this summer, the Greater Homewood Community Corporation (GHCC) Board voted Tuesday<br />\nnight to support the Charles Village Civic Association in opposing<br />\nPhi Gamma Delta's relocation to Charles Street.<br />\nCVCA chairman Jeffrey Hanes outlined the issues raised<br />\nby the fraternity's proposed move and suggested that the GHCC<br />\ndraft a letter backing the Civic Association. Calling GAM \"the<br />\nbiggest Animal House on the Hopkins campus,\" Hanes alleged<br />\nthat the security and peace of mind of the neighborhood residents would be threatened by GAM's presence on the 29th block<br />\nof Charles Street. \"Those kids will do anything but mug you,\"<br />\ncommented one Board member. \"They leave litter on the lawns,<br />\ncreate a lot of noise, keep people awake.\"<br />\nSome Board members wondered whether the group should<br />\ntake a position without consulting the Tuscany-Canterbury<br />\nrepresentative of the GliCC, who was absent at the meeting.<br />\nHowever, since the hearing to determine the zoning status of the<br />\nhouse on Charles Street is scheduled for Oct. 6, the Board decided to act. A motion to draft a letter to send to the Board of<br />\nMunicipal and Zoning Appeals in opposition to GAM's proposed<br />\nmove passed 7-4 with three abstentions.<br />\nSince no member of the Hopkins Student Council attended<br />\nthe meeting, the only University representative present was Dea<br />\nKline, head of Community Affairs.

It's true that activity organizations \u2014 and the News-Letter is no exception \u2014 tend to be cliquish. Each organization has its core group, the people who are<br />\ngenuinely interested and who put regular<br />\ntime into the organization's upkeep, and<br />\nnot surprisingly, these people tend to end<br />\nup running the show.<br />\nWho's running the shows is the big<br />\nquestion at WJHU right now, but the<br />\nanswer presents more problems than simply<br />\n\"a clique.\" The clique at what is supposedly the Hopkins radio station has a number<br />\nof members who arc not Hopkins students,<br />\nor even former Hopkins students. Personnel, both on the management and disc<br />\njockey level, include an assortment of<br />\noutsiders who range from high school kids<br />\nto 35-year-old unemployed professionals.<br />\nOne undeniable result has been that there<br />\nare Hopkins students who haven't gotten<br />\nshows. It is not clear that whether this has<br />\nhappened because of intentional exclusionary tactics on the part of the station, or<br />\nbecause of just plain incompetence, but the<br />\nfact is that students who have made repeated demonstration tapes have often not had<br />\ntheir tapes listened to or approved.<br />\nThe situation seems to be improving<br />\nthis semester, but the issue has been a<br />\nrecurring one over the past few years.

They also say that<br />\nthe non-students are hired in the summer,<br />\n<br />\nwhen students supposedly aren't around,<br />\nand are then retained during the school<br />\nyear to insure continuity.<br />\nThe absence of a WJHU constitution<br />\nfurther frees the station from any duty to<br />\nhire students.<br />\nThe issue here is what the true<br />\npurpose of a college radio station should<br />\nbe. First and foremost, it should be a place<br />\nwhere college students can get experience<br />\non the air. Professionalism is a commendable objective, but there's plenty of time in<br />\nlater life for it to be an overriding concern.<br />\nWhile WJHU, with its FCC license, does<br />\nhave an obligation to its listeners \u2014 an<br />\nobligation that will become increasingly<br />\nimportant as the station expands in range \u2014<br />\nits primary obligation should always be to<br />\nthe students at this university. If that<br />\noutlook is in danger of changing, perhaps<br />\nan FCC license is simply not worth it.<br />\nIf WJHU is really forced to hire<br />\nnon-students in the summer \u2014 and this<br />\nseems questionable, as many students hang<br />\naround in the summer, and the station does<br />\nlittle to publicize openings at that time of<br />\nyear \u2014 then at the very least it should<br />\nreserve a majority of slots for students<br />\nat the start of the new semester. If unemployed professionals are willing to put in a<br />\nlot of time for no pay, they'll be willing to<br />\nput in a little less at the same salary.<br />\nThe station should also revive its old<br />\nAM station as a training ground for new<br />\npeople, but this should in no way serve as a<br />\nrationale for having a closed door policy on<br />\nFM.<br />\n<br />\nEnough people have complained<br />\nabout WJHU's accessibility to make it clear<br />\nthat the station is being run by a clique<br />\nmore exclusive than usual. The University<br />\nadministration, while it still controls the<br />\nstation's purse-strings, should establish<br />\nsome guide-lines for the management of<br />\nWJHU that will ensure unhampered student<br />\nparticipation.

Unfortunately, if the<br />\nsale was rejected only on this<br />\n<br />\nground, the President might feel<br />\nembittered toward Israel and the<br />\nAmerican Jews who fought<br />\nagainst his proposal. If Israel is<br />\nseen as having engineered the<br />\nsale's defeat, the resulting strain<br />\nin relations with the Administration would probably be more<br />\n<br />\ndangerous to Israel in the long<br />\nrun than if the Saudis got the<br />\nAWACS in the first place.<br />\nThe crucial point is that the<br />\nAWACS sale should be rejected<br />\nanyway, for a number of reasons<br />\ndistinct from its threat to Israel.<br />\ncont. on p. 10<br />\n<br />\nGive Them The AWACS<br />\ncont. from p. 5<br />\nests. They are not obliged in<br />\nany way to charge less for their<br />\noil, nor to produce far more<br />\nthan their budget requires, both<br />\nof which they do. The glut on<br />\nthe market that this causes<br />\nforces the more militant OPEC<br />\nmembers to keep their own price<br />\nlevels moderate. On top of all<br />\nthis, the Saudis purchased about<br />\n5.8 billion dollars worth of<br />\nimports from the .United States<br />\nlast year, while using American<br />\nmanagement and technology for<br />\ntheir development programs.<br />\nCan one blame Saudi<br />\nArabia, then, for doubting<br />\n<br />\nAmerica's commitment,especially in light of the AWACS controversy? The Saudis have accepted<br />\nalmost every stringent condition'<br />\nthat could be put on the sale,<br />\nshort of forever allowing only<br />\nAmerican pilots to fly the<br />\nplanes. They have agreed (1)<br />\nnot to fly the planes outside<br />\ntheir own airspace. If they did,<br />\nthe relatively slow 530-miles-perhour speed of these modified<br />\n707 jetlines would be no match<br />\nfor Israeli warplanes, even with<br />\nSaudi fighter cover. Apart from<br />\nbeing less sophisticated, the<br />\nplanes will also lack certain<br />\nelectronic devices used on U.S.<br />\n<br />\nH hire Hater Ion and excitement on the heautilul .Shenandoah River!<br />\n<br />\nand NATO AWACS. most notaThis<br />\nbly anti-jamming gear.<br />\nmeans that, in effect, if the<br />\nSaudis used the planes offensively, they would be forced to<br />\ncommunicate by voice to their<br />\npilots and ground stations,<br />\nwhich would\" allow easy monitoring by the Israelis.<br />\n(2) Although the planes will<br />\nultimately be flown by Saudi<br />\npilots and crew, U.S. experts will<br />\nthe<br />\nmonitor<br />\nintelligencegathering at radar stations on the<br />\nground.<br />\nIn addition, U.S.<br />\nground crews will be stationed in<br />\nSaudi Arabia for years to maintain the aircraft.<br />\n(3) The Saudis have also<br />\nagreed not to pass AWACS<br />\ninformation to other countries<br />\nwithout American approval, and<br />\nalso not to let foreign nationals<br />\nwork on the planes.<br />\nIt seems quite obvious that<br />\nthese planes are vital for the<br />\nlong-term security of the Persian<br />\nGulf.<br />\nThey are desperately<br />\nneeded to deter possible Soviet<br />\nor Soviet-inspired aggression<br />\nagainst the oil fields. It would<br />\ngive the U.S. another chance to<br />\ninject its own military power<br />\nand national prestige into the<br />\nMiddle East.<br />\n<br />\naround me? They have baloney<br />\nsandwiches, cheese sandwiches,<br />\nsliced turkey sandwiches. Nothing that I like.<br />\nBut today, today--it's what?<br />\nMonday, egg salad Monday I've<br />\ndecided and I hope it becomes<br />\negg salad Monday through Sunday. There's a long line. Well,<br />\nthat's not unusual. Three people<br />\nin front of me. Person number<br />\none asks for egg salad on rye.<br />\nEgg salad? I think. Come on,<br />\nthey never have it, so why even<br />\nask for it. It isn't even on the<br />\nsandwich board. It never is. But<br />\nthe sandwich maker says \"Lettuce and tomato on that?\" and<br />\nthe egg salad woman customer<br />\nsays no. Person two asks for an<br />\negg salad on whole wheat to take<br />\nout. She gets it. Three: egg<br />\nsalad on white. White? Oh god,<br />\nbut all right: she gets it and to<br />\ntake out. Now it's my turn.<br />\n\"What'll you have?\" the<br />\nsandwich maker says.<br />\n\"Egg salad on rye,\" I say,\"<br />\n\u2014 but you don't toast it?\"<br />\n\"Toast it?\"<br />\n\"Okay, you don't. On rye,<br />\nuntoasted, no mayonaise on the<br />\nbread, and with lettuce and<br />\ntomato.\"<br />\nSo there you are. Four<br />\npeople in a row. That proves it.<br />\nEgg salad is the most popular<br />\nsandwich at the cafeteria. But<br />\nThe person after me.<br />\nwait.<br />\n\"They have egg salad?\" she<br />\nsays.<br />\n\"Egg salad, yes,\" I say.<br />\n\"Every time I come here<br />\nthey don.t have it and I love egg<br />\nsalad.\"<br />\n\"Same here,\" I say. Now<br />\nthis could've been the basis for<br />\nthe beginning of a relationship,<br />\nbut I'm already hooked up with<br />\nsomeone who loves egg salad.<br />\nSo I got my black coffee,<br />\nglass of ice water, a fork to pick<br />\nup all the egg salad that would<br />\nfall out of the sandwich, and<br />\npaid at the cashier's stand--egg<br />\nsalad, even with lettuce and<br />\ntomato on it, is the cheapest<br />\nsandwich at the cafeteria--and<br />\nsat down at one of the tables.<br />\nThe sandwich was not only<br />\ngood, it was great. There's<br />\nsomeone at Levering who knows<br />\nhow to make egg salad: plenty<br />\nof eggs and celery and not<br />\noverloaded with salt and mayonaise. So I'm saying--I'm sort of<br />\npleading: egg salad every day at<br />\nthe cafeteria, please? To save<br />\nstgdents money, because it's<br />\nnutritious, and because it's obviously a sandwich that students<br />\n<br />\nRide the River with<br />\n<br />\nBLUE RIDGE OUTFITTERS<br />\nNo previous experience is required.

I offer the following<br />\ncontext within which this issue<br />\nmay be viewed.<br />\nAny grading system has<br />\n1)<br />\nbasically two distinct purposes.<br />\nFirst of all, it tells the student<br />\nhow he is doing. Second, it tells<br />\nothers how that person has<br />\ndone. The requirements set by<br />\nthese criteria are not identical.<br />\nIf, in the News-Letier's view, it<br />\nis desirable that a student 'not<br />\nkid himself' about how he is<br />\ndoing, then the logical conclusion involves a straight percentage style grade, out of 100.<br />\nThus, there would be no reasonable doubt on anyone's part.<br />\nHowever, any grading system<br />\nmust take into .account our<br />\nsecond factor, and this one is the<br />\nmost important. Students expect to use their grades to some<br />\nconcrete purpose: grad school,<br />\netc. In this respect, the Hopkins<br />\nstudent is set against students<br />\nfrom all over the country, and<br />\nthe fairest system in this case is<br />\nquite simply the one which<br />\nallows for a fair comparison.<br />\n2) Nobody is perfect. Grades<br />\ninherently reflect a subjective<br />\nevaluation by one person of<br />\nanother's performance. Further<br />\ncategorization of grades is inherently more precise on paper. but<br />\ndoes it accurately reflect a<br />\nstudent's grasp of the material?<br />\nThe whole point of the five<br />\ngrades is that they correspond to<br />\nfive different levels of achievement-A=excellent,etc. What the<br />\nAcademic Council and the NewsLetter seem to have forgotten<br />\nin this whole muddle is that<br />\nletter grades symbolize these<br />\nideas.as the Hopkins catalogue<br />\nindicates. Anyone who has done<br />\nexcellent work receives an 'A'.<br />\nWhat is our equivalent to an<br />\nA-minus, 'sort of excellent?'<br />\nThe whole point is that grades<br />\nwhere designed to designate<br />\ngeneral levels of achievement,<br />\nrather than to single out the<br />\nminutiae of one's performance.<br />\nFurther accuracy may not really<br />\nbe accurate .at all in terms of<br />\nevaluating a student's general<br />\nperformance in a subject area.<br />\nAt some point, one simply must<br />\naccept the idea of arbitrary<br />\nlevels of performance. and.let's<br />\nface it, the differences between<br />\nan A and an A-minus in any sort<br />\nof subject are much more likely<br />\nto reflect the bias of an instructor, or a chance slip on the part<br />\nof the student, than to accurately measure general knowledge.<br />\nIn conclusion, I feel that<br />\ngrades ought to indicate the<br />\nGENERAL quality of a student's work. The more specific<br />\none becomes, the more the<br />\nhuman element intrudes into<br />\nthis measurement.<br />\nDavid Hurwitz<br />\n<br />\n\f' PAU' 10<br />\n<br />\nSF PTI 11131't<br />\n<br />\n9 1<br />\n<br />\n-<br />\n<br />\nPINE BROOK CHINESE RESTAURANT<br />\n11 Northern & Szechuan Style Cuisine<br />\nr 1011 W.36th Street<br />\nr Baltimore, Maryland<br />\n<br />\nAREAS fiNEST<br />\n<br />\n4674499<br />\n<br />\neilkiRCUTTiN9<br />\n<br />\nrWhy spend so much money for a meal at<br />\nWhe other restaurants?

If a radical regime<br />\nassumed power in Saudi Arabia,<br />\nthere is no reason why that<br />\nregime wouldn't use our technology to pursue objectives we<br />\nnever intended it for.<br />\nThis is why some, like<br />\nSenator John Glenn, have suggested that we share control of<br />\nthe AWACS with the Saudis to<br />\nmake sure the weapons are used<br />\nproperly. Unfortunately. Secretary of State Haig rejected this<br />\nidea on the grounds that it<br />\nwould offend the Saudis and be<br />\nseen as meddling in their internal<br />\naffairs. How Haig then rationalizes our involvement in El<br />\nSalvador is a mystery to me.<br />\nWhat isn't a mystery is the<br />\nfoolishness of selling a highly<br />\nsophisticated weapons system to<br />\na politically backward country<br />\nin one of the most volatile<br />\nregions of the world without<br />\nhave definite control over its<br />\nuse. Besides, if the Soviets or<br />\none of their proxies have their<br />\neye on Saudi Arabia, were<br />\nprobably going to get involved<br />\nanyway.<br />\nWhat I find more alarming<br />\nthat the sale of the AWACS<br />\nitself is that this is yet another<br />\nexample of President Reagan's<br />\nnarrow military mentality. He<br />\nseems preoccupied with armaments as a means of increasing<br />\nsecurity at a time when diplomatic initiatives are far more<br />\nimportant. Just as increased<br />\narms sales to Israel continue to<br />\navoid dealing with the Palestinian issue, so do arms sales to<br />\nSaudi Arabia fail to come to<br />\ngrips with the Saudis' continued<br />\ndenial of Israel's existence and<br />\ncont. on p.16<br />\n<br />\nHAIR STUDIO<br />\n<br />\nBREWED AND BOTTLED IN CANADA. imported by Martlet Importing Co.

The word conjures up a vision of an elegant stone building surrounded by cobbled streets, trees,<br />\nand monuments. Yet what is there in it all for you, the Homewood student? Well, as a Hopkins student you are<br />\nentitled to take one course per semester at the Peabody Conservatory. Surprisingly, given the musically-deprived<br />\natmosphere at Homewood, few of you have taken advantage of this unique opportunity. Peabody offers private<br />\nclassical music instruction in a wide range of instruments, as well as in voice. Courses are also offered in classical<br />\nmusic theory and history and, for those with more modern tastes, in jazz, electronic, and computer music. Other<br />\nactivities such as the Peabody Choir, chamber ensembles, and dance classes (in the Preparatory Division) are also<br />\nopen to Hopkins students.<br />\nWhen the Peabody Conservatory became affiliated with JHU back in 1977, a variety of cross-institutional<br />\nopportunities were made available to both Hopkins and Peabody students. According to Tinka Knopf, associate<br />\ndean of the conservatory, the JHU-Peabody program has been, on the whole,successful, with increased participation over the years, especially on the part of Hopkins students, and an expansion of interests from private instruction to courses such as music theory and history. Yet she sees room for more participation and communication<br />\namong students. Dean Knopf was particularly receptive to the possible needs of Hopkins students: \"There is<br />\nsomething at Peabody for everyone who loves classical music.\"<br />\nIf you are a relatively serious musician, Peabody provides you the opportunity to take private instruction<br />\nunder some of the very best teachers. A word of warning, however: the conservatory seldom sacrifices its professional standards, so be ready to put in those long hours of practice. Piano majors, for instance, are expected to<br />\npractice an average of six hours a day, and most Peabody teachers will expect as much from you as from their<br />\npiano majors. The case may vary, of course, depending on the nature of the instrument involved. Playing a wind<br />\ninstrument or singing for six consecutive hours could be physically harmful. If you are interested in taking private<br />\nlessons, do some research. Talk to some Peabody students and try to find a teacher who motivates you. Then<br />\naudition. If worst comes to worst, you will be referred to the Preparatory Division (The Prep). Hopkins pays 50<br />\npercent of the cost of a half hour a week of private instruction at the Conservatory and 25 percent of the cost of a<br />\nhalf hour a week lesson at the Prep.<br />\nPeabody offers courses in music theory for those of you who are interested in composing or simply in<br />\nacquiring a deeper understanding of music. These courses are on the hard side, however. The music history<br />\ncourses might be of greater interest, especially to those of you who would like to strengthen or broaden your<br />\nknowledge of a particular area or period in music. Some of the courses offered are \"Piano Literature,\" (Renaissance to Classical) or (Romantic to Present), \"Opera Literature,\" \"Music of the 19th Century,\" \"Music of the<br />\nBaroque,\" \"Guitar History and Literature,\" and \"History of Music in America.\" One of the newest problems with<br />\nthe cross-registration process, according to Dean Knopf, is that Hopkins students are signing up for courses with<br />\nattractive titles without being aware of possible prerequisites. \"Students may go around in circles without talking<br />\nto the right people and end up in a class which is way over their heads with a teacher who doesn't know that they<br />\nare Hopkins,- she explains. To tackle the placement problem. Hopkins students are advised to consult Dean Knopf<br />\nor Dr. Morris before signing up for a course at the Conservatory.<br />\nMoving away from the classical scene, Peabody 'offers a program in jazz that is worth looking into. An<br />\ninteresting History of Jazz course is offered by Nina Sheldon,a top New York jazz pianist. Don't take it if you're<br />\nlooking for a gut though;the course is said to be rigorous. This year witnesses the beginning of a new Ja Improvi-<br />\n<br />\nA Piano Lesson W.<br />\n<br />\nby Martin Carlson<br />\nIt was a .Thursday afternoon, so that meant I had<br />\nmy piano lesson at Peabody, right after lunch. I caught<br />\nthe Med School shuttle at Homewood and hopped off<br />\nnext to Mt. Vernon Place. Seeing the elegant townhouses, stone paved streets, the Washington Monument,<br />\nand the Conservatory itself immediately put me in a<br />\ndifferent frame of mind. I left all the nerds down on<br />\nD-level and opted for an hour of music instead of one of<br />\nstudying. I followed the spiral staircase past the statue<br />\nand up to the second story, where my teacher's studio<br />\nwas located.<br />\nAs 1 waited for my teacher to return from his<br />\nmidday break. I read the notices concerning a variety of<br />\nmusical and non-musical subjects: competitions, conventions, lectures, jobs, apartments for rent, and so on.<br />\nThe requests for conductors of various ethnic singing<br />\ngioups (e.g., the Jewish Women's Chorus)always looked<br />\ninteresting; but the thought of attending an International Tuba Convention continues to strike my fancy.<br />\nThen a short figure approached, slowly but<br />\nsurely, impeccably dressed in a dark suit. I accosted him<br />\nand shook him and shook his hand as he greeted me with<br />\nhis customary,\"Como estas?\" We exchanged words,for<br />\nhe was always affable but never overwhelming. He<br />\nmethodically pulled out his keys, unlocked his studio,<br />\n<br />\nA4.<br />\n<br />\nThe main staircase at The Pea<br />\n<br />\njai\u00b0 Esteban<br />\n<br />\nand entered. After checking his mail, he assumed his<br />\nposition in the chair beside me. He asked what I had<br />\nprepared for him. I whipped out some Bach, and my<br />\nlesson with Julio Esteban began.<br />\nI'm really not a good pianist, and I invariably<br />\nscrewed up the Bach, but Mr. Esteban remained forever<br />\ncalm and encouraging; honest, but tasteful.<br />\n\"Not bad--but not good, either,\" he 'commented<br />\nin his light and always charming Spanish accent. \"You<br />\nhave to play this part very, very softly. and you don't do<br />\nthat. You have to be more delicate here-this isn't some<br />\nmachine you're dealing with.\"<br />\nThe Beethoven went about the same, but when I<br />\ngot to the Spanish-flavored Debussy, he criticized me for<br />\nlacking feeling. \"You can't just use your mind with this<br />\npiece; you must put your blood into it. Sangre, Inas<br />\nsangre.\" He then shooed me off the bench to show me<br />\nhow it should have been played, Mediterranean blood<br />\nand all. Julio Esteban is no young man, but one could<br />\nnever tell from the way he demonstrated the pieces.<br />\nMy hour all too quickly came to an end, and I<br />\nhad to be off. We courteously exchanged hasta luegos<br />\nand adioses as he began the next hour by greeting the<br />\nfollowing student.<br />\n\"Como estas?\"<br />\nBy anyone's standards, Julio Esteban has been<br />\naround. He Nk.'is born in Shanghai, China (he won't say<br />\nwhen) while his Spanish father was conducting the city's<br />\norchestra, but moved to Barcelona when he was one year<br />\nold, after his father's death. For 18 years he received his<br />\neducation on Spanish soil, then chose to head for the<br />\nPhilipine Islands, where much of his family already lived.<br />\nBy 1947 Mr. Esteban was the director of the<br />\nConservatory of Music of the University of Santo<br />\nTomas. After having sent students to study in the<br />\nUnited States, he decided in 1954 to make the trip<br />\nhimself to visit some of the institutions of this country.<br />\nWhile at the Peabody Conservatory, the directors offered<br />\nhim a one-year teaching position. A permanent post as a<br />\nmember of the piano faculty followed, and Julio<br />\nEsteban changed his home to Charm City, USA.<br />\n<br />\nWhen asked, don Julio will talk about his past,<br />\nbut his enthusiasm lies in the present and future. The<br />\nvoyage that ended a couple of weeks ago took him to<br />\nAustralia and the Philipines, where he visited relatives,<br />\ngave lectures and conducted masters' classes. He was<br />\nexcited about the warm reception at his former school,<br />\nand was amazed by the new cultural center at the<br />\nUniversity of the Philipines. He heavily praises the<br />\nPhilipines for their warmth and openness, but notes the<br />\nunbearably hot climate.<br />\nIn all his worldly travels, Julio. Esteban has<br />\nencountered many well-known musicians and other<br />\ndignitaries. He commented, nevertheless,\"I'm not going<br />\nto talk about all the people I know --I know them all, but<br />\nI think it would be in bad taste to turn this interview<br />\ninto a name-dropping session.\"<br />\nI ask don Julio about regional tensions in his<br />\nnative Spain between the Castillians, the Basques, the<br />\nCatalonians, and others. \"I'll tell you this,\" he states<br />\nauthoritatively, \"I go all over Spain and speak with the<br />\npeople and they speak with me. As long as you're nice<br />\nto someone,they will be nice to you.\"<br />\nThat could very well be Julio Esteban's basic<br />\nphilosophy of life. People interacting with people will<br />\ninvariably penetrate the forced hostilities of governments working with governments. \"People are nice-that's all there is to it,\" he adds. \"I've just been to the<br />\nPhilipines and Australia, where the people were always<br />\nopen and friendly. I love them and they love me.\"<br />\nMr. Esteban is one of those rare souls who<br />\npractice what they preach. During a Friday afternoon<br />\nrepertory class--where his students gathered to perform<br />\nfor themselves--I saw the rapport that he had with his<br />\nstudents.<br />\nThe first student on stage played some Bach, but<br />\nshe goofed a little. After the entire rep class, Mr.<br />\nEsteban would talk privately with those who had performed, but often he three in comments between<br />\nstudents. \"We'll have to work on that one a little<br />\nmore,\" he said simply. \"We need to develop your<br />\nconfidence.\"<br />\ncont. on p. 14<br />\n<br />\n\fby'ramie Weeramantly)<br />\nMartin Carlson) Joe Levine<br />\n<br />\n-<br />\n<br />\nl'!<br />\n<br />\nhe Peabody Conserratory.<br />\n<br />\nsation Clinic, taught by Vito Cuscuna. The clinic will cover several jazz styles, such as \"blues,\" \"rock,\" and \"cool.\"<br />\nThe Peabody Jazz Ensemble is, of course, open to students.<br />\nThe Conservatory also has a strong electronic music studio. Dr. lbey's Electronic Music course provides<br />\nhands-on experience with the Moog synthesizer and other studio equipment, as well as an introduction to the<br />\nliterature and compositional aspects of electronic music. Concerts of electronic music from the Peabody studio are<br />\ngiven several times annually.<br />\nFor the past year, the Peabody Electronic Music Studio has been attempting to gain a foothold in the<br />\nexciting field of computer music. Computer-generated sound offers the composer virtually unlimited control over<br />\nthe auditory medium at the expense of the tedium of sitting at a computer terminal for hours to generate a few<br />\nseconds of music. For some, however, this tedium is liberation from the more arduous task of mastering a conventional instrument and working within the limitations of its repertoire. The results are a lavish, intricate sound<br />\nwhich makes synthesized music seem plodding by comparison. A prototype computer music system may be<br />\noperating at Peabody sometime during this academic year, using software developed at Stanford and Bell Labs.<br />\nAnyone interested in working on the computer music project is encouraged to contact Geoffrey Wright at the<br />\nPeabody Electronic Music Studio or JP Lewis at the JHU Computing Center.<br />\nMany of the activities listed above have only one common prerequisite--the enjoyment of music. Interaction<br />\nwith others who share this same pursuit could be stimulating, relaxing or even good for one's social life. For those<br />\nof you who are interested, Peabody offers various forms of group activities. If, for instance, you play a recorder<br />\nand love Bach,, why not audition for the Baroque Ensemble? Chamber ensembles include ones for flute, piano,<br />\npercussion, string, wind, and brass. Likewise, if you enjoy singing in a group,-consider auditioning for the Peabody<br />\nChoir. Last year, the choir performed several large choral works for which it had to recruit talent from all over<br />\nBaltimore. The choir meets for four hours a week. Many Peabody piano majors take choir to meet their ensemble<br />\nrequirement. And for a change of pace, those of you who enjoy dancing are eligible to take one free course a<br />\nsemester at the Prep. You are also given a 25 percent discount on a 2nd dance class. Classes are offered at all levels<br />\nin ballet, moden, Spanish, and character dance. So if you're concerned about staying in shape, how about some<br />\nballet? It can be more strenuous than football practice. Or if you'd like something more exotic, why not a class<br />\nin Flamenco? Whatever activity you choose, you're bound to make some friends in the process.<br />\nAbove all, it is this saine ability to communicate that Dean Knopf seeks to develop through the JHUPeabody program. This does not necessarily entail taking a course at Peabody. Hopkins students could, for<br />\nexample, attend student recitals. \"These may only be student recitals yet they can be very exciting because some<br />\nof these young people will someday make it big,\" Knopf observes. \"Andre Watts, for instance, was once a Peabody<br />\nstudent.\" And from a pragmatic standpoint, if you just need a piano to practice on, you should take out some<br />\ntime and go to Peabody. The Conservatory has 134 grand pianos and the Prep has four floors of them, in contrast<br />\nto the three uprights in Levering Hall. Outsiders might also sense a strong competitive element at Peabody, yet<br />\nmost students there seem to accept it. In the words of one freshman: \"Despite the highly competitive spirit<br />\nhere, people are still fairly open and warm.\" A graduate student added that \"Competition is inevitable at an<br />\ninstitution of higher study like Peabody but the students are able to rise above it to create an amiable atmosphere.\"<br />\nIf you walk into the Peabody cafeteria and see groups of talented people chatting comfortably together. you will<br />\nno doubt agree.<br />\n<br />\nCharles C \u2022ton And ACC That Jazz<br />\nChess occupies an only slightly less important<br />\nby Joe Levine<br />\nI cannot claim that I know about Charles Coving-\u2022 position than music in Covington's life.

Otherwise; however, Covington<br />\nhas chosen to stay out of sight.<br />\n\"If people see you all the time,<br />\nthey say, 'Oh, that's just Charlie,' and<br />\nthey don't want to see you anymore,\" he<br />\nsays. \"Besides, the whole thing's a<br />\nracket.

It quickly<br />\nbecomes apparent just how much time<br />\nand thought he has put into organizing<br />\nhis ideas and expanding the limits of what<br />\nhe, and therefore you, can do. While<br />\nstandard jazz improvisation courses require the student to memorize a variety<br />\nof modal scales, until he is fluent enough<br />\nto improvise with the notes of these<br />\nscales, Covington rescues his students<br />\nfrom the drudgery of scales, by writing<br />\nsongs which contain the scales arranged in<br />\nan endless variety of patterns. The songs<br />\nare beautiful enough to be thoroughly<br />\nenjoyed for their, own sake, and completely functional as exercises.<br />\n\"I like to make it interesting for<br />\nboth of us,\" Covington says. \"I learn a<br />\nlot from teaching, because it helps me<br />\n<br />\nsystematize my work.\"<br />\nThrough each of his lessons, he<br />\ncontinues to convey the sense of his own<br />\noriginal approach to music.

He did<br />\nnot carry himself with an<br />\nathlete's grace, nor did he seem<br />\nto want to. He had a unique,<br />\nround head of blonde, very<br />\nstraight hair that often covered<br />\nhis narrow, slitted eyes. He<br />\nsported a rather large belly for<br />\nsuch a great athlete \u2014 a belly<br />\nenlarged by the numerous bouts<br />\nthat we all had with the<br />\n\"brews.\"<br />\nThe unusual thing about<br />\nthis guy, as great a person as he<br />\n<br />\nwas, as great a pitcher as he<br />\nwas, was that he never once got<br />\nconceited. The guy was genuinely unselfish, humble, and just<br />\na touch naive. Most importantly, though, he was our true<br />\nfriend. He touched our lives in a<br />\nway that we never thought<br />\nanyone could have in such a<br />\nshort period of time.

He told us of their<br />\nexperiences and triumphs in<br />\nsuch a way that by the end of<br />\nthe year we all felt very close to<br />\neach one of them.

But statistics were<br />\nthe furthest thing from Tim's<br />\nmind. What was important was<br />\nthat Hopkins was winning and<br />\nwinning consistently. You see,<br />\nin addition to all of the wins,<br />\nsaves, and strikeouts he gave to<br />\nthe 1981 squad, he gave something of far greater value. He<br />\ngave the spirit to win. He was a<br />\ntotal team player. He pitched<br />\nhis heart out for the team's sake,<br />\nnot his own. He loved to savor<br />\nthe victories; he took the losses<br />\n<br />\nas hard as anyone.

Whiting School of<br />\nEngineering has begun the process of seeking national accreditation for most of the academic<br />\ndepartments offering Bachelor<br />\nof Engineering Science' degrees.<br />\nIn anticipation of future<br />\naccreditation possibilities, - the<br />\nBioengineering<br />\nprogram has<br />\nchanged its name to Biomedical<br />\nEngineering while at the same<br />\ntime, the Committee-run program has been replaced by its<br />\nown separate department. Most<br />\nof the professors who served on<br />\nthe original committee were<br />\nfaculty members from the<br />\nHopkins School of Medicine.<br />\nWith the establishment of a<br />\nseparate department at Homewood, many professors will now<br />\nhold joint appointments -with<br />\nother departments at Homewood or with the Medical<br />\nInstitutions. Dean of Faculty of<br />\nEngineering David Vande Linde<br />\nexplained, \"the separate department will only helpstrengthen<br />\nthe present program.This fall, the Accrediting<br />\nBoard for Engineering and Technology (ABEAT) - a consortium of professional societies<br /><br />\npreviously called the Engineering<br />\nCouncil for Professional Development - will begin reviewing<br />\nthe programs in the departments<br />\nof Mechanics, Materials Science,<br />\nand Electrical Engineering - one<br />\nHopkins department that has<br />\nbeen accredited since the establishment of the engineering<br />\naccrediting boards.<br />\nUnder the guidelines set<br /><br />\nforth by ABEAT, all students<br />\nmust satisfy certain distribution<br />\nrequirements: a minimum num,<br />\nber of credits in the non-engineering disciplines and a set<br />\nnumber of credit hours in design<br />\ncourses and basic sciences.<br />\nMoreover, a department under<br />\nconsideration for accreditation<br />\nmust have at least some upperclass students in the current<br /><br />\nseniors are receiving,\" for there<br />\nprogram.<br />\nFor this reason and because must be some \"evolutionary<br />\nof the name change, the Bio- changes\" to make a program<br />\nmedical Engineering Department into an accreditable one.

The Institute now<br />\noccupies a seven-acre waterfront<br />\nproperty valued at S1.5 million,<br />\nthe former location of Gould<br />\nElectronics' Chesapeake Instrument Division.<br />\nCBI was founded in 1948 at<br />\nHomewood as a part of the<br />\nDepartment of Oceanography.<br />\nThe first director was Donald W.<br />\nPritchard, a well-known physical<br />\noceanographer. Under his direction, CBI contributed to the<br />\nunderstanding of the marine<br />\norganisms in the Bay and helped<br />\ndevelop the new fields of ecology and environmental science.<br /><br />\nAccording to George Fisher,<br />\nchairman of the Department of<br />\nEarth and Planetary Sciences, in<br />\n1969 the Department of Oceanography, the Department of<br />\nGeology and several people<br />\ninterested in geography ,and<br />\nmechanics came together to<br />\nform the Department of Earth<br />\nand Planetary Sciences. This<br /><br />\narrangement did not satisfy CBI<br />\nbecause the Institute was specifically interested only in the<br />\nChesapeake Bay. The administration of CBI was therefore<br />\nseparated from the Department<br />\nof Earth and Planetary Sciences,<br />\nFisher explained.<br />\nSince Gould Electronics offered the Shady Side plant to<br /><br />\nHopkins, the University has<br />\nspent more than Si million onits<br />\nrenovation.

The News-Letter has received complaints from present<br />\nand former members of the<br />\nWJHU staff about the inaccessibility of on-the-air positions to<br />\nHopkins students.<br />\nThe station, which is one of<br />\nthe few organizations on campus<br />\nwhich does not receive funding<br />\nfrom the Student Activities<br />\nCommission (SAC), is also one<br />\nof the few which include<br />\nnon-students<br />\nas<br />\nmembers.<br />\nEdmund Newman, General Manager of the station, has estimated<br />\nthat about 20 out of the 100<br />\nstaff members are non-students,<br />\nknown to other WJHU workers<br />\nas \"community members.According to Karen Malkin,<br />\nwho hosts a bi-weekly evening<br />\nprogram of progressive rock,<br />\n\"When I go down to do my<br />\nshow, I'm surrounded by nonstudents.<br />\nA lot are not in<br />\nofficial positions. They hang<br />\naround and put more time in<br />\nthan studentS. can and, after a<br />\nwhile, they get a lot more<br />\nresponsibility.\"<br /><br />\nNewman explained the station's policy. \"The basic reason<br />\n(for recruiting community members) is because we couldn't get<br />\nalong without them,\" he said.<br />\n\"During summer, Christmas vacation, spring breaks, most students go home.\"<br />\nPeter Brieloff, a former DJ<br />\nwho has been trying since last<br />\nyear to return to the station,<br />\nbelieves WJHU's managers have<br />\nnot tried hard enough to recruit<br />\nHopkins students to fill summer<br />\npositions, \"If they would advertise a lot more for students, they<br />\ncould get people to fill the<br />\nslots. No one knows they need<br />\nals. There are a lot of Hopkins<br />\nstudents around here during the<br />\nsummer. A lot of people would<br />\nbe interested if they knew about<br />\nit.\"<br />\nUnlike other student organizations, WJHU is not regulated<br />\nby the SAC.

In 1970, 15 percent of<br />\nRemington's people lived below<br />\nthe federally defined poverty<br />\nlevel (S6,600 a year for a family<br />\nof four) and 80 percent hadn't<br />\nfinished high school. Today<br />\nvery few even begin; the dropout<br />\nrate is up around 9 out of 10.<br />\nThere is a shrinking job pool and<br />\nconsiderable racial tension where<br />\ncontact exists. Relations between police and the community<br />\nhave in the past been explosive<br />\nand remain strained.<br />\nHowever, despite the dawn<br />\nof an era which holds little<br />\npromise of governmental support for communities like<br />\nRemington, there are people<br />\nthere who are trying to build<br />\ntheir community by improving<br />\nexisting institutions and sometimes by creating new ones. One<br />\nrelatively new organization in<br /><br />\nRemington is the four-year-old<br />\nCommunity Survival Center at<br />\n207 W. 25th Street, founded in<br />\nOctober 1977 by Tom Culotta<br />\nand a group of young Remingtonians.<br />\nAccording to its<br />\ndirector it was conceived with<br />\nthe philosophy of \"community<br />\ncontrol through collectivization- it aims to create a broadly<br />\nbased grass roots organization in<br />\norder to promote self-development and greater participation in<br />\nmaking the decisions which<br />\nvitally affect the area's people.<br />\nThe activities of the Center are<br />\ndesigned to address and resolve<br />\nsocial, educational and economic<br />\nproblems which are destructive<br />\nforces in the community.<br />\nThe problems facing Remington overlap to a great extent.<br />\nAccording to Culotta, the area's<br />\neconomic disability is the product, at least in part, of its<br />\ncont. on p. 7<br /><br />\nPAGE 2 SEPTEMBER 25,, 1981<br /><br />\nCommunity Notes<br />\nBY SUNITA HANJURA<br /><br />\ncommenkily<br />\nPSU Marches On Washington<br />\nBY MARK TRACHTENBERG<br /><br />\nGHCC Opposes GAM<br />\nAt its first meeting since this summer, the Greater Homewood Community Corporation (GHCC) Board voted Tuesday<br />\nnight to support the Charles Village Civic Association in opposing<br />\nPhi Gamma Delta's relocation to Charles Street.<br />\nCVCA chairman Jeffrey Hanes outlined the issues raised<br />\nby the fraternity's proposed move and suggested that the GHCC<br />\ndraft a letter backing the Civic Association. Calling GAM \"the<br />\nbiggest Animal House on the Hopkins campus,\" Hanes alleged<br />\nthat the security and peace of mind of the neighborhood residents would be threatened by GAM's presence on the 29th block<br />\nof Charles Street. \"Those kids will do anything but mug you,\"<br />\ncommented one Board member. \"They leave litter on the lawns,<br />\ncreate a lot of noise, keep people awake.\"<br />\nSome Board members wondered whether the group should<br />\ntake a position without consulting the Tuscany-Canterbury<br />\nrepresentative of the GliCC, who was absent at the meeting.<br />\nHowever, since the hearing to determine the zoning status of the<br />\nhouse on Charles Street is scheduled for Oct. 6, the Board decided to act. A motion to draft a letter to send to the Board of<br />\nMunicipal and Zoning Appeals in opposition to GAM's proposed<br />\nmove passed 7-4 with three abstentions.<br />\nSince no member of the Hopkins Student Council attended<br />\nthe meeting, the only University representative present was Dea<br />\nKline, head of Community Affairs. Kline objected on procedural<br />\ngrounds, complaining that since Hanes' presentation was not on<br />\nthe agenda for the meeting she had had no chance to ascertain the<br />\nUniversity's stand on the issue.<br /><br />\nMusical Group Plans Conceits<br />\nHodie Inc., a nelv musical group, is planning a series of<br />\nfour concerts at the first Unitarian Church on Charles Street<br />\nbetween October 18 and April 4. This group of young professional musicians is devoted to performing and building an audience for contemporary (20th century) music. In its repertoire of<br />\nrecent artists. Hodie will pay particular attention to Baltimore<br />\nand Maryland composers.<br /><br />\nThe American left can still<br />\nturn out a crowd.<br />\nThat was the message delivered by the massive \"Solidarity<br />\nDay\" demonstration held last<br />\nSaturday in Washington, D.C.<br />\nThe news media said 250,000<br />\npeople attended; organizers<br />\nclaimed more than 500,000.<br />\nWhichever figure you believe,<br />\nthe event was big - as big as any<br />\nprotest ever staged in the capital.<br />\nFrom a vantage point 200 yards<br />\nor so west of the Capitol, the<br />\ncrowd seemed to stretch all the<br />\nway down the Mall to the<br />\nWashington Monument.<br />\nThe march had the air of a<br />\npep rally. At the assembly near<br />\nthe Monument, one could hear<br />\nmarching bands as they turned<br />\nthe corner of 15th and ConstituBoth AFSCME (the<br />\ntion.<br />\nAmerican Federation of State,<br />\nCounty, and Municipal Employees) and the AFL-CIO \u2014 the<br />\nmain organizer of the event \u2014<br />\nhad large, blimp-shaped balloons; the AFL-CIO's was painted red, white,,and blue. On the<br />\nstreet in front of where the<br />\nstudent activists gathered stood<br />\na sea of red pennants with an<br />\nAmerican flag attached; those<br />\nwere carried by members of the<br />\nSteamfitters Union. They were<br />\nfollowed by a sea of blue-andwhite caps; those were the<br /><br />\nMachinists.<br />\nSuch display caused some<br />\ngrumbling among other marchers. \"They're advertising their<br />\nfucking locals and not solidarity,\"<br />\ncomplained<br />\nAndrew<br />\nSpence, a member of the Hopkins Progressive Students Union.<br />\nHowever, most PSUers<br />\nseemed to accept the reasons<br />\nbehind the showiness: demonstrating the support of the<br />\nrank-and-file for their leaders'<br />\nanti-Reagan stand and counteracting Reagan's attempt to portray his opposition as selfishly<br />\nunpatriotic. \"We are America,\"<br />\nsaid a speaker at the assembly<br />\npoint.

As they were preparing<br />\nto march, the students chanted<br />\nslogans like \"The people, united,<br />\nwill never be defeated,\" \"Hey,<br />\nhey, ho, ho, we won't fight for<br />\nTexaco,\" and \"Money for tuition, not for ammunition.\"<br />\nMany wore backpacks and<br />\nIndian headbands.<br />\nOne sign<br />\ncont. on p. 19<br /><br />\nPSU members were among the 250,000 who attended the rally.<br /><br />\n0/11011010011011\u2022110114111\u2022NO110110114,11111111011\u2022N\u202211\u202211\u2022N\u2022V\u202211\u202211\u202211\u202211\u202211\u202211\u2022N\u202211\u202211\u2022N\u2022NOMON$<br /><br />\n\u2022<br />\n4<br /><br />\nFRESHMEM!*<br /><br />\n6<br /><br />\na<br /><br />\nClass Office Petitions<br /><br />\n6<br />\n4<br />\n4<br /><br />\nand Statements<br /><br />\naaa<br />\naa<br />\na<br /><br />\nS<br />\n4<br />\n6<br />\n6<br />\n6<br />\n6<br /><br />\ndue Monday, Sept. 2Q\u2022<br /><br />\na<br />\na<br />\nt by 5pm in the S.C.

It's true that activity organizations \u2014 and the News-Letter is no exception \u2014 tend to be cliquish. Each organization has its core group, the people who are<br />\ngenuinely interested and who put regular<br />\ntime into the organization's upkeep, and<br />\nnot surprisingly, these people tend to end<br />\nup running the show.<br />\nWho's running the shows is the big<br />\nquestion at WJHU right now, but the<br />\nanswer presents more problems than simply<br />\n\"a clique.\" The clique at what is supposedly the Hopkins radio station has a number<br />\nof members who arc not Hopkins students,<br />\nor even former Hopkins students. Personnel, both on the management and disc<br />\njockey level, include an assortment of<br />\noutsiders who range from high school kids<br />\nto 35-year-old unemployed professionals.<br />\nOne undeniable result has been that there<br />\nare Hopkins students who haven't gotten<br />\nshows. It is not clear that whether this has<br />\nhappened because of intentional exclusionary tactics on the part of the station, or<br />\nbecause of just plain incompetence, but the<br />\nfact is that students who have made repeated demonstration tapes have often not had<br />\ntheir tapes listened to or approved.<br />\nThe situation seems to be improving<br />\nthis semester, but the issue has been a<br />\nrecurring one over the past few years.

They also say that<br />\nthe non-students are hired in the summer,<br /><br />\nwhen students supposedly aren't around,<br />\nand are then retained during the school<br />\nyear to insure continuity.<br />\nThe absence of a WJHU constitution<br />\nfurther frees the station from any duty to<br />\nhire students.<br />\nThe issue here is what the true<br />\npurpose of a college radio station should<br />\nbe. First and foremost, it should be a place<br />\nwhere college students can get experience<br />\non the air. Professionalism is a commendable objective, but there's plenty of time in<br />\nlater life for it to be an overriding concern.<br />\nWhile WJHU, with its FCC license, does<br />\nhave an obligation to its listeners \u2014 an<br />\nobligation that will become increasingly<br />\nimportant as the station expands in range \u2014<br />\nits primary obligation should always be to<br />\nthe students at this university. If that<br />\noutlook is in danger of changing, perhaps<br />\nan FCC license is simply not worth it.<br />\nIf WJHU is really forced to hire<br />\nnon-students in the summer \u2014 and this<br />\nseems questionable, as many students hang<br />\naround in the summer, and the station does<br />\nlittle to publicize openings at that time of<br />\nyear \u2014 then at the very least it should<br />\nreserve a majority of slots for students<br />\nat the start of the new semester. If unemployed professionals are willing to put in a<br />\nlot of time for no pay, they'll be willing to<br />\nput in a little less at the same salary.<br />\nThe station should also revive its old<br />\nAM station as a training ground for new<br />\npeople, but this should in no way serve as a<br />\nrationale for having a closed door policy on<br />\nFM.<br /><br />\nEnough people have complained<br />\nabout WJHU's accessibility to make it clear<br />\nthat the station is being run by a clique<br />\nmore exclusive than usual. The University<br />\nadministration, while it still controls the<br />\nstation's purse-strings, should establish<br />\nsome guide-lines for the management of<br />\nWJHU that will ensure unhampered student<br />\nparticipation.

To<br />\nknowingly purport misinformation as a priori truth is an insult<br />\nto the intelligence of the reading<br />\naudience, and this is the crime of<br />\n\"Supply-Side , Theory and Practice\" (N-L, 9/18/81). \"Supply<br />\nSide\" contained purely biased<br />\nopinion, and unreasoned opinion<br />\nat that. I shall expose the facts<br />\nin order to dispell \"Supply<br />\nSide's malicious misinformation.<br />\nThe first and most salient<br />\npoint is that Reagan's economic<br />\nprogram goes into effect October 1, 1981, and it is therefore<br />\nerroneous to state that \"But in<br />\npractice, the theory will not<br />\nwork as perfectly.\" Most likely,<br />\nthe full effects of the program<br />\nwill not be felt until near the<br />\nbeginning of the second quarter<br />\nof 1982, when individuals file<br />\ntheir tax returns.<br />\nSecondly, to say that<br />\n\"Much of Reagan's program was<br />\nby<br />\nimplemented<br />\nalready<br />\nThatcher in Britain\" without<br />\nexamining the dFlerilt economic conditions is a sign of rashness. The British government<br />\nemploys directly 33% of the<br />\npopulation (from The Year in<br />\nReview by Nigel Tree), and<br /><br />\nPup<br />\nPap<br /><br />\nregularly bails out--a la Chrysler-its nationalized industries, such<br />\nas British Air and British Steel.<br />\nTaxes also range around 30-50%<br />\n(Time, 2/16/81). It is true that<br />\nthe Tories enacted strict monetary controls (as in America),<br />\nbut they have also kept tight<br />\ncontrol of the money lending<br />\nrate (this is not the case in<br />\nAmerica); the combination of<br />\nthese two factors in particular<br />\nforced private industry in Britain<br />\nto constrict and curb investment, and so workers were laid<br />\noff. Tight money conditions<br />\nforced both the public and<br />\nnationalized sectors to lay off<br />\nalso, and so all these workers<br />\nbegan receiving unemployment<br />\nbenefits. In order to finance<br />\nthese benefits, the government<br />\nhad to print more money (which<br />\nthe U.S. is not doing) which was<br />\nthen promptly taxed. At the<br />\nsame time, civil servants got a<br />\n28% pay hike.

Since Israel is a more<br />\nvaluable ally in the region,<br />\nendangering its security might be<br />\nseen as indirectly endangering<br />\nour own. Unfortunately, if the<br />\nsale was rejected only on this<br /><br />\nground, the President might feel<br />\nembittered toward Israel and the<br />\nAmerican Jews who fought<br />\nagainst his proposal. If Israel is<br />\nseen as having engineered the<br />\nsale's defeat, the resulting strain<br />\nin relations with the Administration would probably be more<br /><br />\ndangerous to Israel in the long<br />\nrun than if the Saudis got the<br />\nAWACS in the first place.<br />\nThe crucial point is that the<br />\nAWACS sale should be rejected<br />\nanyway, for a number of reasons<br />\ndistinct from its threat to Israel.<br />\ncont. on p. 10<br /><br />\nGive Them The AWACS<br />\ncont. from p. 5<br />\nests. They are not obliged in<br />\nany way to charge less for their<br />\noil, nor to produce far more<br />\nthan their budget requires, both<br />\nof which they do. The glut on<br />\nthe market that this causes<br />\nforces the more militant OPEC<br />\nmembers to keep their own price<br />\nlevels moderate. On top of all<br />\nthis, the Saudis purchased about<br />\n5.8 billion dollars worth of<br />\nimports from the .United States<br />\nlast year, while using American<br />\nmanagement and technology for<br />\ntheir development programs.<br />\nCan one blame Saudi<br />\nArabia, then, for doubting<br /><br />\nAmerica's commitment,especially in light of the AWACS controversy? The Saudis have accepted<br />\nalmost every stringent condition'<br />\nthat could be put on the sale,<br />\nshort of forever allowing only<br />\nAmerican pilots to fly the<br />\nplanes. They have agreed (1)<br />\nnot to fly the planes outside<br />\ntheir own airspace. If they did,<br />\nthe relatively slow 530-miles-perhour speed of these modified<br />\n707 jetlines would be no match<br />\nfor Israeli warplanes, even with<br />\nSaudi fighter cover. Apart from<br />\nbeing less sophisticated, the<br />\nplanes will also lack certain<br />\nelectronic devices used on U.S.<br /><br />\nH hire Hater Ion and excitement on the heautilul .Shenandoah River!<br /><br />\nand NATO AWACS. most notaThis<br />\nbly anti-jamming gear.<br />\nmeans that, in effect, if the<br />\nSaudis used the planes offensively, they would be forced to<br />\ncommunicate by voice to their<br />\npilots and ground stations,<br />\nwhich would\" allow easy monitoring by the Israelis.<br />\n(2) Although the planes will<br />\nultimately be flown by Saudi<br />\npilots and crew, U.S. experts will<br />\nthe<br />\nmonitor<br />\nintelligencegathering at radar stations on the<br />\nground.<br />\nIn addition, U.S.<br />\nground crews will be stationed in<br />\nSaudi Arabia for years to maintain the aircraft.<br />\n(3) The Saudis have also<br />\nagreed not to pass AWACS<br />\ninformation to other countries<br />\nwithout American approval, and<br />\nalso not to let foreign nationals<br />\nwork on the planes.<br />\nIt seems quite obvious that<br />\nthese planes are vital for the<br />\nlong-term security of the Persian<br />\nGulf.<br />\nThey are desperately<br />\nneeded to deter possible Soviet<br />\nor Soviet-inspired aggression<br />\nagainst the oil fields. It would<br />\ngive the U.S. another chance to<br />\ninject its own military power<br />\nand national prestige into the<br />\nMiddle East.<br /><br />\naround me? They have baloney<br />\nsandwiches, cheese sandwiches,<br />\nsliced turkey sandwiches. Nothing that I like.<br />\nBut today, today--it's what?<br />\nMonday, egg salad Monday I've<br />\ndecided and I hope it becomes<br />\negg salad Monday through Sunday. There's a long line. Well,<br />\nthat's not unusual. Three people<br />\nin front of me. Person number<br />\none asks for egg salad on rye.<br />\nEgg salad? I think. Come on,<br />\nthey never have it, so why even<br />\nask for it. It isn't even on the<br />\nsandwich board. It never is. But<br />\nthe sandwich maker says \"Lettuce and tomato on that?\" and<br />\nthe egg salad woman customer<br />\nsays no. Person two asks for an<br />\negg salad on whole wheat to take<br />\nout. She gets it. Three: egg<br />\nsalad on white. White? Oh god,<br />\nbut all right: she gets it and to<br />\ntake out. Now it's my turn.<br />\n\"What'll you have?\" the<br />\nsandwich maker says.<br />\n\"Egg salad on rye,\" I say,\"<br />\n\u2014 but you don't toast it?\"<br />\n\"Toast it?\"<br />\n\"Okay, you don't. On rye,<br />\nuntoasted, no mayonaise on the<br />\nbread, and with lettuce and<br />\ntomato.\"<br />\nSo there you are. Four<br />\npeople in a row. That proves it.<br />\nEgg salad is the most popular<br />\nsandwich at the cafeteria. But<br />\nThe person after me.<br />\nwait.<br />\n\"They have egg salad?\" she<br />\nsays.<br />\n\"Egg salad, yes,\" I say.<br />\n\"Every time I come here<br />\nthey don.t have it and I love egg<br />\nsalad.\"<br />\n\"Same here,\" I say. Now<br />\nthis could've been the basis for<br />\nthe beginning of a relationship,<br />\nbut I'm already hooked up with<br />\nsomeone who loves egg salad.<br />\nSo I got my black coffee,<br />\nglass of ice water, a fork to pick<br />\nup all the egg salad that would<br />\nfall out of the sandwich, and<br />\npaid at the cashier's stand--egg<br />\nsalad, even with lettuce and<br />\ntomato on it, is the cheapest<br />\nsandwich at the cafeteria--and<br />\nsat down at one of the tables.<br />\nThe sandwich was not only<br />\ngood, it was great. There's<br />\nsomeone at Levering who knows<br />\nhow to make egg salad: plenty<br />\nof eggs and celery and not<br />\noverloaded with salt and mayonaise. So I'm saying--I'm sort of<br />\npleading: egg salad every day at<br />\nthe cafeteria, please?

I offer the following<br />\ncontext within which this issue<br />\nmay be viewed.<br />\nAny grading system has<br />\n1)<br />\nbasically two distinct purposes.<br />\nFirst of all, it tells the student<br />\nhow he is doing. Second, it tells<br />\nothers how that person has<br />\ndone. The requirements set by<br />\nthese criteria are not identical.<br />\nIf, in the News-Letier's view, it<br />\nis desirable that a student 'not<br />\nkid himself' about how he is<br />\ndoing, then the logical conclusion involves a straight percentage style grade, out of 100.<br />\nThus, there would be no reasonable doubt on anyone's part.<br />\nHowever, any grading system<br />\nmust take into .account our<br />\nsecond factor, and this one is the<br />\nmost important. Students expect to use their grades to some<br />\nconcrete purpose: grad school,<br />\netc. In this respect, the Hopkins<br />\nstudent is set against students<br />\nfrom all over the country, and<br />\nthe fairest system in this case is<br />\nquite simply the one which<br />\nallows for a fair comparison.<br />\n2) Nobody is perfect. Grades<br />\ninherently reflect a subjective<br />\nevaluation by one person of<br />\nanother's performance. Further<br />\ncategorization of grades is inherently more precise on paper. but<br />\ndoes it accurately reflect a<br />\nstudent's grasp of the material?<br />\nThe whole point of the five<br />\ngrades is that they correspond to<br />\nfive different levels of achievement-A=excellent,etc. What the<br />\nAcademic Council and the NewsLetter seem to have forgotten<br />\nin this whole muddle is that<br />\nletter grades symbolize these<br />\nideas.as the Hopkins catalogue<br />\nindicates. Anyone who has done<br />\nexcellent work receives an 'A'.<br />\nWhat is our equivalent to an<br />\nA-minus, 'sort of excellent?'<br />\nThe whole point is that grades<br />\nwhere designed to designate<br />\ngeneral levels of achievement,<br />\nrather than to single out the<br />\nminutiae of one's performance.<br />\nFurther accuracy may not really<br />\nbe accurate .at all in terms of<br />\nevaluating a student's general<br />\nperformance in a subject area.<br />\nAt some point, one simply must<br />\naccept the idea of arbitrary<br />\nlevels of performance. and.let's<br />\nface it, the differences between<br />\nan A and an A-minus in any sort<br />\nof subject are much more likely<br />\nto reflect the bias of an instructor, or a chance slip on the part<br />\nof the student, than to accurately measure general knowledge.<br />\nIn conclusion, I feel that<br />\ngrades ought to indicate the<br />\nGENERAL quality of a student's work. The more specific<br />\none becomes, the more the<br />\nhuman element intrudes into<br />\nthis measurement.<br />\nDavid Hurwitz<br /><br />\n' PAU' 10<br /><br />\nSF PTI 11131't<br /><br />\n9 1<br /><br />\n-<br /><br />\nPINE BROOK CHINESE RESTAURANT<br />\n11 Northern &amp; Szechuan Style Cuisine<br />\nr 1011 W.36th Street<br />\nr Baltimore, Maryland<br /><br />\nAREAS fiNEST<br /><br />\n4674499<br /><br />\neilkiRCUTTiN9<br /><br />\nrWhy spend so much money for a meal at<br />\nWhe other restaurants?

If a radical regime<br />\nassumed power in Saudi Arabia,<br />\nthere is no reason why that<br />\nregime wouldn't use our technology to pursue objectives we<br />\nnever intended it for.<br />\nThis is why some, like<br />\nSenator John Glenn, have suggested that we share control of<br />\nthe AWACS with the Saudis to<br />\nmake sure the weapons are used<br />\nproperly. Unfortunately. Secretary of State Haig rejected this<br />\nidea on the grounds that it<br />\nwould offend the Saudis and be<br />\nseen as meddling in their internal<br />\naffairs. How Haig then rationalizes our involvement in El<br />\nSalvador is a mystery to me.<br />\nWhat isn't a mystery is the<br />\nfoolishness of selling a highly<br />\nsophisticated weapons system to<br />\na politically backward country<br />\nin one of the most volatile<br />\nregions of the world without<br />\nhave definite control over its<br />\nuse. Besides, if the Soviets or<br />\none of their proxies have their<br />\neye on Saudi Arabia, were<br />\nprobably going to get involved<br />\nanyway.<br />\nWhat I find more alarming<br />\nthat the sale of the AWACS<br />\nitself is that this is yet another<br />\nexample of President Reagan's<br />\nnarrow military mentality. He<br />\nseems preoccupied with armaments as a means of increasing<br />\nsecurity at a time when diplomatic initiatives are far more<br />\nimportant. Just as increased<br />\narms sales to Israel continue to<br />\navoid dealing with the Palestinian issue, so do arms sales to<br />\nSaudi Arabia fail to come to<br />\ngrips with the Saudis' continued<br />\ndenial of Israel's existence and<br />\ncont. on p.16<br /><br />\nHAIR STUDIO<br /><br />\nBREWED AND BOTTLED IN CANADA. imported by Martlet Importing Co.

The word conjures up a vision of an elegant stone building surrounded by cobbled streets, trees,<br />\nand monuments. Yet what is there in it all for you, the Homewood student? Well, as a Hopkins student you are<br />\nentitled to take one course per semester at the Peabody Conservatory. Surprisingly, given the musically-deprived<br />\natmosphere at Homewood, few of you have taken advantage of this unique opportunity. Peabody offers private<br />\nclassical music instruction in a wide range of instruments, as well as in voice. Courses are also offered in classical<br />\nmusic theory and history and, for those with more modern tastes, in jazz, electronic, and computer music. Other<br />\nactivities such as the Peabody Choir, chamber ensembles, and dance classes (in the Preparatory Division) are also<br />\nopen to Hopkins students.<br />\nWhen the Peabody Conservatory became affiliated with JHU back in 1977, a variety of cross-institutional<br />\nopportunities were made available to both Hopkins and Peabody students. According to Tinka Knopf, associate<br />\ndean of the conservatory, the JHU-Peabody program has been, on the whole,successful, with increased participation over the years, especially on the part of Hopkins students, and an expansion of interests from private instruction to courses such as music theory and history. Yet she sees room for more participation and communication<br />\namong students. Dean Knopf was particularly receptive to the possible needs of Hopkins students: \"There is<br />\nsomething at Peabody for everyone who loves classical music.\"<br />\nIf you are a relatively serious musician, Peabody provides you the opportunity to take private instruction<br />\nunder some of the very best teachers. A word of warning, however: the conservatory seldom sacrifices its professional standards, so be ready to put in those long hours of practice. Piano majors, for instance, are expected to<br />\npractice an average of six hours a day, and most Peabody teachers will expect as much from you as from their<br />\npiano majors. The case may vary, of course, depending on the nature of the instrument involved. Playing a wind<br />\ninstrument or singing for six consecutive hours could be physically harmful. If you are interested in taking private<br />\nlessons, do some research. Talk to some Peabody students and try to find a teacher who motivates you. Then<br />\naudition. If worst comes to worst, you will be referred to the Preparatory Division (The Prep). Hopkins pays 50<br />\npercent of the cost of a half hour a week of private instruction at the Conservatory and 25 percent of the cost of a<br />\nhalf hour a week lesson at the Prep.<br />\nPeabody offers courses in music theory for those of you who are interested in composing or simply in<br />\nacquiring a deeper understanding of music. These courses are on the hard side, however. The music history<br />\ncourses might be of greater interest, especially to those of you who would like to strengthen or broaden your<br />\nknowledge of a particular area or period in music. Some of the courses offered are \"Piano Literature,\" (Renaissance to Classical) or (Romantic to Present), \"Opera Literature,\" \"Music of the 19th Century,\" \"Music of the<br />\nBaroque,\" \"Guitar History and Literature,\" and \"History of Music in America.\" One of the newest problems with<br />\nthe cross-registration process, according to Dean Knopf, is that Hopkins students are signing up for courses with<br />\nattractive titles without being aware of possible prerequisites. \"Students may go around in circles without talking<br />\nto the right people and end up in a class which is way over their heads with a teacher who doesn't know that they<br />\nare Hopkins,- she explains. To tackle the placement problem. Hopkins students are advised to consult Dean Knopf<br />\nor Dr. Morris before signing up for a course at the Conservatory.<br />\nMoving away from the classical scene, Peabody 'offers a program in jazz that is worth looking into. An<br />\ninteresting History of Jazz course is offered by Nina Sheldon,a top New York jazz pianist. Don't take it if you're<br />\nlooking for a gut though;the course is said to be rigorous. This year witnesses the beginning of a new Ja Improvi-<br /><br />\nA Piano Lesson W.<br /><br />\nby Martin Carlson<br />\nIt was a .Thursday afternoon, so that meant I had<br />\nmy piano lesson at Peabody, right after lunch. I caught<br />\nthe Med School shuttle at Homewood and hopped off<br />\nnext to Mt. Vernon Place. Seeing the elegant townhouses, stone paved streets, the Washington Monument,<br />\nand the Conservatory itself immediately put me in a<br />\ndifferent frame of mind. I left all the nerds down on<br />\nD-level and opted for an hour of music instead of one of<br />\nstudying. I followed the spiral staircase past the statue<br />\nand up to the second story, where my teacher's studio<br />\nwas located.<br />\nAs 1 waited for my teacher to return from his<br />\nmidday break. I read the notices concerning a variety of<br />\nmusical and non-musical subjects: competitions, conventions, lectures, jobs, apartments for rent, and so on.<br />\nThe requests for conductors of various ethnic singing<br />\ngioups (e.g., the Jewish Women's Chorus)always looked<br />\ninteresting; but the thought of attending an International Tuba Convention continues to strike my fancy.<br />\nThen a short figure approached, slowly but<br />\nsurely, impeccably dressed in a dark suit. I accosted him<br />\nand shook him and shook his hand as he greeted me with<br />\nhis customary,\"Como estas?\" We exchanged words,for<br />\nhe was always affable but never overwhelming. He<br />\nmethodically pulled out his keys, unlocked his studio,<br /><br />\nA4.<br /><br />\nThe main staircase at The Pea<br /><br />\njai\u00b0 Esteban<br /><br />\nand entered. After checking his mail, he assumed his<br />\nposition in the chair beside me. He asked what I had<br />\nprepared for him. I whipped out some Bach, and my<br />\nlesson with Julio Esteban began.<br />\nI'm really not a good pianist, and I invariably<br />\nscrewed up the Bach, but Mr. Esteban remained forever<br />\ncalm and encouraging; honest, but tasteful.<br />\n\"Not bad--but not good, either,\" he 'commented<br />\nin his light and always charming Spanish accent. \"You<br />\nhave to play this part very, very softly. and you don't do<br />\nthat. You have to be more delicate here-this isn't some<br />\nmachine you're dealing with.\"<br />\nThe Beethoven went about the same, but when I<br />\ngot to the Spanish-flavored Debussy, he criticized me for<br />\nlacking feeling. \"You can't just use your mind with this<br />\npiece; you must put your blood into it. Sangre, Inas<br />\nsangre.\" He then shooed me off the bench to show me<br />\nhow it should have been played, Mediterranean blood<br />\nand all. Julio Esteban is no young man, but one could<br />\nnever tell from the way he demonstrated the pieces.<br />\nMy hour all too quickly came to an end, and I<br />\nhad to be off. We courteously exchanged hasta luegos<br />\nand adioses as he began the next hour by greeting the<br />\nfollowing student.<br />\n\"Como estas?\"<br />\nBy anyone's standards, Julio Esteban has been<br />\naround. He Nk.'is born in Shanghai, China (he won't say<br />\nwhen) while his Spanish father was conducting the city's<br />\norchestra, but moved to Barcelona when he was one year<br />\nold, after his father's death. For 18 years he received his<br />\neducation on Spanish soil, then chose to head for the<br />\nPhilipine Islands, where much of his family already lived.<br />\nBy 1947 Mr. Esteban was the director of the<br />\nConservatory of Music of the University of Santo<br />\nTomas. After having sent students to study in the<br />\nUnited States, he decided in 1954 to make the trip<br />\nhimself to visit some of the institutions of this country.<br />\nWhile at the Peabody Conservatory, the directors offered<br />\nhim a one-year teaching position. A permanent post as a<br />\nmember of the piano faculty followed, and Julio<br />\nEsteban changed his home to Charm City, USA.<br /><br />\nWhen asked, don Julio will talk about his past,<br />\nbut his enthusiasm lies in the present and future. The<br />\nvoyage that ended a couple of weeks ago took him to<br />\nAustralia and the Philipines, where he visited relatives,<br />\ngave lectures and conducted masters' classes. He was<br />\nexcited about the warm reception at his former school,<br />\nand was amazed by the new cultural center at the<br />\nUniversity of the Philipines. He heavily praises the<br />\nPhilipines for their warmth and openness, but notes the<br />\nunbearably hot climate.<br />\nIn all his worldly travels, Julio. Esteban has<br />\nencountered many well-known musicians and other<br />\ndignitaries. He commented, nevertheless,\"I'm not going<br />\nto talk about all the people I know --I know them all, but<br />\nI think it would be in bad taste to turn this interview<br />\ninto a name-dropping session.\"<br />\nI ask don Julio about regional tensions in his<br />\nnative Spain between the Castillians, the Basques, the<br />\nCatalonians, and others. \"I'll tell you this,\" he states<br />\nauthoritatively, \"I go all over Spain and speak with the<br />\npeople and they speak with me. As long as you're nice<br />\nto someone,they will be nice to you.\"<br />\nThat could very well be Julio Esteban's basic<br />\nphilosophy of life. People interacting with people will<br />\ninvariably penetrate the forced hostilities of governments working with governments. \"People are nice-that's all there is to it,\" he adds. \"I've just been to the<br />\nPhilipines and Australia, where the people were always<br />\nopen and friendly. I love them and they love me.\"<br />\nMr. Esteban is one of those rare souls who<br />\npractice what they preach. During a Friday afternoon<br />\nrepertory class--where his students gathered to perform<br />\nfor themselves--I saw the rapport that he had with his<br />\nstudents.<br />\nThe first student on stage played some Bach, but<br />\nshe goofed a little. After the entire rep class, Mr.<br />\nEsteban would talk privately with those who had performed, but often he three in comments between<br />\nstudents. \"We'll have to work on that one a little<br />\nmore,\" he said simply. \"We need to develop your<br />\nconfidence.\"<br />\ncont. on p. 14<br /><br />\nby'ramie Weeramantly)<br />\nMartin Carlson) Joe Levine<br /><br />\n-<br /><br />\nl'!<br /><br />\nhe Peabody Conserratory.<br /><br />\nsation Clinic, taught by Vito Cuscuna. The clinic will cover several jazz styles, such as \"blues,\" \"rock,\" and \"cool.\"<br />\nThe Peabody Jazz Ensemble is, of course, open to students.<br />\nThe Conservatory also has a strong electronic music studio. Dr. lbey's Electronic Music course provides<br />\nhands-on experience with the Moog synthesizer and other studio equipment, as well as an introduction to the<br />\nliterature and compositional aspects of electronic music. Concerts of electronic music from the Peabody studio are<br />\ngiven several times annually.<br />\nFor the past year, the Peabody Electronic Music Studio has been attempting to gain a foothold in the<br />\nexciting field of computer music. Computer-generated sound offers the composer virtually unlimited control over<br />\nthe auditory medium at the expense of the tedium of sitting at a computer terminal for hours to generate a few<br />\nseconds of music. For some, however, this tedium is liberation from the more arduous task of mastering a conventional instrument and working within the limitations of its repertoire. The results are a lavish, intricate sound<br />\nwhich makes synthesized music seem plodding by comparison. A prototype computer music system may be<br />\noperating at Peabody sometime during this academic year, using software developed at Stanford and Bell Labs.<br />\nAnyone interested in working on the computer music project is encouraged to contact Geoffrey Wright at the<br />\nPeabody Electronic Music Studio or JP Lewis at the JHU Computing Center.<br />\nMany of the activities listed above have only one common prerequisite--the enjoyment of music. Interaction<br />\nwith others who share this same pursuit could be stimulating, relaxing or even good for one's social life. For those<br />\nof you who are interested, Peabody offers various forms of group activities. If, for instance, you play a recorder<br />\nand love Bach,, why not audition for the Baroque Ensemble? Chamber ensembles include ones for flute, piano,<br />\npercussion, string, wind, and brass. Likewise, if you enjoy singing in a group,-consider auditioning for the Peabody<br />\nChoir. Last year, the choir performed several large choral works for which it had to recruit talent from all over<br />\nBaltimore. The choir meets for four hours a week. Many Peabody piano majors take choir to meet their ensemble<br />\nrequirement. And for a change of pace, those of you who enjoy dancing are eligible to take one free course a<br />\nsemester at the Prep. You are also given a 25 percent discount on a 2nd dance class. Classes are offered at all levels<br />\nin ballet, moden, Spanish, and character dance. So if you're concerned about staying in shape, how about some<br />\nballet? It can be more strenuous than football practice. Or if you'd like something more exotic, why not a class<br />\nin Flamenco? Whatever activity you choose, you're bound to make some friends in the process.<br />\nAbove all, it is this saine ability to communicate that Dean Knopf seeks to develop through the JHUPeabody program. This does not necessarily entail taking a course at Peabody. Hopkins students could, for<br />\nexample, attend student recitals. \"These may only be student recitals yet they can be very exciting because some<br />\nof these young people will someday make it big,\" Knopf observes. \"Andre Watts, for instance, was once a Peabody<br />\nstudent.\" And from a pragmatic standpoint, if you just need a piano to practice on, you should take out some<br />\ntime and go to Peabody. The Conservatory has 134 grand pianos and the Prep has four floors of them, in contrast<br />\nto the three uprights in Levering Hall. Outsiders might also sense a strong competitive element at Peabody, yet<br />\nmost students there seem to accept it. In the words of one freshman: \"Despite the highly competitive spirit<br />\nhere, people are still fairly open and warm.\" A graduate student added that \"Competition is inevitable at an<br />\ninstitution of higher study like Peabody but the students are able to rise above it to create an amiable atmosphere.\"<br />\nIf you walk into the Peabody cafeteria and see groups of talented people chatting comfortably together. you will<br />\nno doubt agree.<br /><br />\nCharles C \u2022ton And ACC That Jazz<br />\nChess occupies an only slightly less important<br />\nby Joe Levine<br />\nI cannot claim that I know about Charles Coving-\u2022 position than music in Covington's life.

Otherwise; however, Covington<br />\nhas chosen to stay out of sight.<br />\n\"If people see you all the time,<br />\nthey say, 'Oh, that's just Charlie,' and<br />\nthey don't want to see you anymore,\" he<br />\nsays. \"Besides, the whole thing's a<br />\nracket.

It quickly<br />\nbecomes apparent just how much time<br />\nand thought he has put into organizing<br />\nhis ideas and expanding the limits of what<br />\nhe, and therefore you, can do. While<br />\nstandard jazz improvisation courses require the student to memorize a variety<br />\nof modal scales, until he is fluent enough<br />\nto improvise with the notes of these<br />\nscales, Covington rescues his students<br />\nfrom the drudgery of scales, by writing<br />\nsongs which contain the scales arranged in<br />\nan endless variety of patterns. The songs<br />\nare beautiful enough to be thoroughly<br />\nenjoyed for their, own sake, and completely functional as exercises.<br />\n\"I like to make it interesting for<br />\nboth of us,\" Covington says. \"I learn a<br />\nlot from teaching, because it helps me<br /><br />\nsystematize my work.\"<br />\nThrough each of his lessons, he<br />\ncontinues to convey the sense of his own<br />\noriginal approach to music. But then<br />\nCharles Covington has always gone his<br />\nown way.<br />\nThese days, while big names are<br />\ncoming and going, Charles Covington is<br />\ngetting better at just about everything.<br />\nHe lives with his wife and his I 2-year-old<br />\ndaughter, and divides his time between<br />\nmusic, chess, magic, and painting.

The first is whether one should be<br />\ndedicated to staying in one's homeland,<br />\nwhere one's roots are, even when life<br />\nbecomes miserable.

Since we're not sure we<br />\nunderstand the characters' motivations,<br />\n(for example, why Piet is so dedicated to<br />\nstaying in a miserable South Africa) it is<br />\nhard to sympathize with them.
