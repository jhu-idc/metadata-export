Strange? Not at all! Congress<br />\nattempts to regulate morals by legislation; Goucher pursues the<br />\nsame course.<br />\nThe hypocrisy of the Goucher regulations have been brought out<br />\nmore strongly than ever this year, perhaps, because the local papers<br />\nhave been more successful in securing the news of punishments<br />\nmeted out to the lassies for such very execrable sins as smoking.<br />\nIn reality, however, this year is no exception. It is a more or less<br />\nwell-known fact that Goucher students disobey what they feel to<br />\nbe an unfair rule by smoking whenever an opportunity presents<br />\nitself. Not only do they grasp every opportunity to smoke, but<br />\nthey \"sign out,\" ostensibly to spend an evening reading or listening<br />\nto the radio at some girl's home, and then attend parties till the<br />\nwee hours of the morning.<br />\nWe can't blame the girls. They fully realize that the so-called<br />\nSocial Regulations have become anachronisms, and, therefore, pay<br />\nno attention to them. Unfortunately, as always happens in cases<br />\nwhere perfectly harmless things are prohibited, practices which are<br />\ninnocuous enough in moderation are carried to extremes.<br />\nAny rules that are laid down by the authorities at a girls' college<br />\nare the result of a feeling of responsibility for the students' welfare. Well and good. When the rules are totally out of tune with<br />\ngenerally accepted notions of contemporary morals, however, the<br />\npendulum swings the other way. And as long as Goucher makes'<br />\nit sin to smoke or to go riding with \"gentlemen\" after six o'clock,<br />\nthe Baltimore papers will continue to print stories of girls being<br />\nput on the restricted list!<br />\n<br />\nIS DEBATING DEAD?<br />\nThe steadily decreasing interest in debating at Johns Hopkins<br />\n-has been evoking comment as to the advisability of its continuance.<br />\nFormerly, an intercollegiate debate would draw fairly large crowds,<br />\n-and interclass debates would always be attended with considerable<br />\nenthusiasm. Now, the few intercollegiate contests that have been<br />\nheld have been particularly significant both by the small number<br />\nOf people who have been present at the debates and the complete<br />\nlack of interest in them on the campus.<br />\nThe situation is perhaps worse in the interclass debates. The<br />\nnumber of candidates for the senior team this year was actually<br />\nless than the number of men required: men had to be recruited<br />\nand almost begged to take their places on the team. And even<br />\nthen, up to within a week before the debate, no preparation whatsoever had been made. If it were not for the more or less lucrative<br />\nprizes offered, we doubt seriously whether there would be either<br />\na senior team or a junior team.<br />\nWe know perfectly well that there are always some who don't<br />\nlike attention to be called to the fact that any existing institution\"<br />\nis atrophying. They say that unless the critic can offer constructive criticism, he would do better to keep quiet. In the case of<br />\ndebating at Hopkins,however,we believe that the continued apathy<br />\nof the student body has proved that the most constructive criticism<br />\nthat can be offered is the recommendation that debating be dropped<br />\nfrom the roster of student activities. -<br />\n<br />\nYES AND NO<br />\n<br />\nTHE LITTLE THEATRE<br />\nNorth Howard at Franklin<br />\nPerformances from 2 to II P.

However, everyone came to<br />\nknow this seat and its usefulness<br />\npassed beyond.

Strange? Not at all! Congress<br />\nattempts to regulate morals by legislation; Goucher pursues the<br />\nsame course.<br />\nThe hypocrisy of the Goucher regulations have been brought out<br />\nmore strongly than ever this year, perhaps, because the local papers<br />\nhave been more successful in securing the news of punishments<br />\nmeted out to the lassies for such very execrable sins as smoking.<br />\nIn reality, however, this year is no exception. It is a more or less<br />\nwell-known fact that Goucher students disobey what they feel to<br />\nbe an unfair rule by smoking whenever an opportunity presents<br />\nitself. Not only do they grasp every opportunity to smoke, but<br />\nthey \"sign out,\" ostensibly to spend an evening reading or listening<br />\nto the radio at some girl's home, and then attend parties till the<br />\nwee hours of the morning.<br />\nWe can't blame the girls. They fully realize that the so-called<br />\nSocial Regulations have become anachronisms, and, therefore, pay<br />\nno attention to them. Unfortunately, as always happens in cases<br />\nwhere perfectly harmless things are prohibited, practices which are<br />\ninnocuous enough in moderation are carried to extremes.<br />\nAny rules that are laid down by the authorities at a girls' college<br />\nare the result of a feeling of responsibility for the students' welfare. Well and good. When the rules are totally out of tune with<br />\ngenerally accepted notions of contemporary morals, however, the<br />\npendulum swings the other way. And as long as Goucher makes'<br />\nit sin to smoke or to go riding with \"gentlemen\" after six o'clock,<br />\nthe Baltimore papers will continue to print stories of girls being<br />\nput on the restricted list!<br /><br />\nIS DEBATING DEAD?<br />\nThe steadily decreasing interest in debating at Johns Hopkins<br />\n-has been evoking comment as to the advisability of its continuance.<br />\nFormerly, an intercollegiate debate would draw fairly large crowds,<br />\n-and interclass debates would always be attended with considerable<br />\nenthusiasm. Now, the few intercollegiate contests that have been<br />\nheld have been particularly significant both by the small number<br />\nOf people who have been present at the debates and the complete<br />\nlack of interest in them on the campus.<br />\nThe situation is perhaps worse in the interclass debates. The<br />\nnumber of candidates for the senior team this year was actually<br />\nless than the number of men required: men had to be recruited<br />\nand almost begged to take their places on the team. And even<br />\nthen, up to within a week before the debate, no preparation whatsoever had been made. If it were not for the more or less lucrative<br />\nprizes offered, we doubt seriously whether there would be either<br />\na senior team or a junior team.<br />\nWe know perfectly well that there are always some who don't<br />\nlike attention to be called to the fact that any existing institution\"<br />\nis atrophying. They say that unless the critic can offer constructive criticism, he would do better to keep quiet. In the case of<br />\ndebating at Hopkins,however,we believe that the continued apathy<br />\nof the student body has proved that the most constructive criticism<br />\nthat can be offered is the recommendation that debating be dropped<br />\nfrom the roster of student activities. -<br /><br />\nYES AND NO<br /><br />\nTHE LITTLE THEATRE<br />\nNorth Howard at Franklin<br />\nPerformances from 2 to II P.

E. Seniors very carefully examined their<br />\nchairs before sittibg down. The real<br />\nreason dated back tothe day before,<br />\nwhen attempts were made to seemingly electrocute several of their<br />\nnumber.<br />\nThis vile plot originated in a simple, apparently harmless chair, one<br />\nof whose legs was loose and which<br />\nwould precipitate its occupant floorwards. However, everyone came to<br />\nknow this seat and its usefulness<br />\npassed beyond. Three very ingenious seniors then devised the<br />\n\"electric chair.\"<br />\nThese three conspirators met on<br />\nFriday night and laid their trap. A<br />\nbattery was put on the roof and a<br />\nFord spark coil attached to it. The<br />\nswitch was placed in a desk drawer<br />\nbehind the victim's seat. From the<br />\ndrawer fine wires were led to the<br />\nnails in the seat of the chair. The<br />\ninfernal machine was tested and<br />\nproved satisfactory through four<br />\novercoats. Then the plotters retired<br />\nto their beds.<br /><br />\nOn Monday morning the first<br />\nclass was conducted by a new instructor so that nothing was done.<br />\nThe second class was the Dean's,<br />\nso still nothing shocking occurred.<br />\nBut the third period was Mr.<br />\nLampe's. Then it happened.<br />\nLeo,\"Virgin,\" Baberich was in the<br />\n\"chair.\" This unfortunate youth<br />\nhad pulled himself well up to his<br />\ntable.<br />\nMr. Lampe's back was<br />\nturned. The air became tense.<br />\nSuddenly a shriek rang out. When<br />\nMr. Lampe whirled around he saw<br />\nLeo reaching for the ceiling. But,<br />\nalas! poor boy, the table pinned his<br />\nlegs in place. It was a touching<br />\nscene, but \"Virgin\" was held fast.<br />\nFinally he freed himself, though he<br />\nwas imprisoned long enough for the<br />\nclass to really enjoy the spectacle.<br />\nThe day wore on, and many were<br />\nthe victims who sat in that fateful<br />\nchair.

For twelve<br />\nyears I had smoked Edgeworth without being tempted by any other brand,<br />\nbut the fragrance emanating from the<br />\npipe of the gentleman beside me was<br />\nso agreeable that I could not resist<br />\nthe temptation to speak of it.<br />\n\"That is wonderfully fragrant tobacco you have there,\" I remarked.<br />\n\"Would you mind telling me the name<br />\nof it?\"<br />\n\"It is Edgeworth,\" he answered.<br />\nWe then congratulated each other<br />\nupon our mutual good taste, and I<br />\ndecided that I would continue to use<br />\nhis brand and mine.<br />\nSincerely yours,<br />\nS. H.<br /><br />\nEdgeworth<br /><br />\net-rite for particulars to<br /><br />\nExtra High Grade<br /><br />\nG.
