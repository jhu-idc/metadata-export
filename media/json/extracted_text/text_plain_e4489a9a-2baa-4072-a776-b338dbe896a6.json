He said that it<br />\nis really pitiful to see the utter ignorance of the law evidenced by<br />\nthose who received the call for<br />\njury duty and other court work.<br />\nThe remedy is positive: citizens<br />\nshould arrange at frequent intervals to stop at the Courthouse to<br />\nget an insight on practical court<br />\nproceedings. The psychiatrist<br />\nurged Hopkins students especially<br />\nto take a trip to the Courthouse,<br />\npromising personally to conduct<br />\nand introduce them to actual court<br />\nproceedings.<br />\nTypes of Criminals<br />\n<br />\nDr. Oliver discussed the various<br />\ntypes of criminal's. The murderer<br />\nisn't really a criminal at all, he<br />\nsaid. He is a man who has made<br />\na mistake and pays for it the rest<br />\nof his life. He is the victim of<br />\nfate, which brings together simultaneously the elements of hate,<br />\nanger, gun, and man.<br />\nThe criminal is no different<br />\nfrom anyone else. He gets into a<br />\njam and is simply too weak to get<br />\nout of it. The worst type of criminal is the confidence man, the scurrile thief who, undergoing no danger to himself, lives on deceit,<br />\nwrecking lives, and ruining life<br />\nplans. This man gets a short sentence, gets out, and does the same<br />\nthing over again.<br />\nThen there is the new type of<br />\nholdup man, who looks like any<br />\nundergraduate in college. He is<br />\nthe , nerveless kind whose gun<br />\nshakes in his hand. People should<br />\nnot submit docilely to such a man.<br />\nAS cuff will send him scurrying.<br />\nFinally, there is the organized<br />\nclass of criminal which makes<br />\ncrime a profession. He hasn't the<br />\nslightest regard for human life.<br />\nDr. Oliver set forth the notorious<br />\nWhittemore as an example.

The affair was deplorable from every angle. It is the first<br />\ntime in several years that the unwritten rule against bad feeling<br />\nin freshman-sophomore clashes has been broken to any serious<br />\nextent. Far worse than that, the fight occurred at a time when<br />\nthe University was, in a sense of the word, on exhibition before<br />\nthe public. About half the crowd, which included many outsiders,<br />\nwitnessed the episode, and doubtless did not carry away any<br />\nheightened impression of the University.<br />\nAt the time of writing we do not know any of the details<br />\nof the combat; we are not especially interested. Very probably<br />\nneither of the men deserves any more blame than the other. The<br />\nsophomore, beyond question, believed that he was carrying out<br />\nhis duty, and he was. In the past regulations had always been<br />\nenforced at games, why should they not continue to be enforced?<br />\nThe freshman, with an equal show of reason, resisted the strongarm methods of the sophs. No man wants to be humiliated before a crowd of two thousand people. The resulting fight was<br />\nunquestionably disgraceful, but not all of the blame can be laid<br />\nupon either of the principals. They were to some extent the victims of circumstance; the system itself is at fault.<br />\nIt is remarkable that no serious trouble has occurred before.<br />\nFootball games are not the place to enforce regulations. Outsiders who come to the games pay their admission to see a football game, not to watch the punishment of unruly freshmen.<br />\nMany of them do not understand what such occasions mean; they<br />\nnever heard of regulations or have the slightest inkling of their<br />\nsignificance. Naturally they look upon the activities of the Pep<br />\nCommittee as pure rowdyism. Also, from the point of view of a<br />\nfreshman punishment which under ordinary conditions would be<br />\naccepted as just becomes ten times as bitter when administered<br />\nbefore a large audience.<br />\nWe do not mean that regulations should not be in effect during games, but merely that they should not be enforced there.<br />\nThe Pep Committee could very easily make out a list of all freshmen ,breaking regulations. These offenders could be summoned<br />\nat the beginning of the next week, perhaps a double share of punishment should be meted out to them. At all events, however,<br />\nsome method must be adopted to remove the necessity of washing<br />\nour dirty linen in public.<br />\n<br />\nAs you have probably guessed by this time, we think we are<br />\na very bored, sophisticated, thrilless undergrad, but we received<br />\nwhat we consider the supreme thrill a few evenings ago while<br />\nsupping at the Barn.

Oliver, psychiatrist of the<br />\nBaltimore Police Department and<br />\nMedical Officer of the Baltimore<br />\nSupreme.Bench, speaking on the<br />\nsubject of \"Criminals, Murderers<br />\nand Detective's\" at last Thursday's<br />\nassembly.<br />\nLittle contact with the law, and<br />\nthat limited to the traffic court,<br />\nwas the reason Dr. Oliver gave<br />\nfor this assertion. He said that it<br />\nis really pitiful to see the utter ignorance of the law evidenced by<br />\nthose who received the call for<br />\njury duty and other court work.<br />\nThe remedy is positive: citizens<br />\nshould arrange at frequent intervals to stop at the Courthouse to<br />\nget an insight on practical court<br />\nproceedings. The psychiatrist<br />\nurged Hopkins students especially<br />\nto take a trip to the Courthouse,<br />\npromising personally to conduct<br />\nand introduce them to actual court<br />\nproceedings.<br />\nTypes of Criminals<br /><br />\nDr. Oliver discussed the various<br />\ntypes of criminal's. The murderer<br />\nisn't really a criminal at all, he<br />\nsaid. He is a man who has made<br />\na mistake and pays for it the rest<br />\nof his life. He is the victim of<br />\nfate, which brings together simultaneously the elements of hate,<br />\nanger, gun, and man.<br />\nThe criminal is no different<br />\nfrom anyone else. He gets into a<br />\njam and is simply too weak to get<br />\nout of it. The worst type of criminal is the confidence man, the scurrile thief who, undergoing no danger to himself, lives on deceit,<br />\nwrecking lives, and ruining life<br />\nplans. This man gets a short sentence, gets out, and does the same<br />\nthing over again.<br />\nThen there is the new type of<br />\nholdup man, who looks like any<br />\nundergraduate in college. He is<br />\nthe , nerveless kind whose gun<br />\nshakes in his hand. People should<br />\nnot submit docilely to such a man.<br />\nAS cuff will send him scurrying.<br />\nFinally, there is the organized<br />\nclass of criminal which makes<br />\ncrime a profession. He hasn't the<br />\nslightest regard for human life.<br />\nDr. Oliver set forth the notorious<br />\nWhittemore as an example.

The affair was deplorable from every angle. It is the first<br />\ntime in several years that the unwritten rule against bad feeling<br />\nin freshman-sophomore clashes has been broken to any serious<br />\nextent. Far worse than that, the fight occurred at a time when<br />\nthe University was, in a sense of the word, on exhibition before<br />\nthe public. About half the crowd, which included many outsiders,<br />\nwitnessed the episode, and doubtless did not carry away any<br />\nheightened impression of the University.<br />\nAt the time of writing we do not know any of the details<br />\nof the combat; we are not especially interested. Very probably<br />\nneither of the men deserves any more blame than the other. The<br />\nsophomore, beyond question, believed that he was carrying out<br />\nhis duty, and he was. In the past regulations had always been<br />\nenforced at games, why should they not continue to be enforced?<br />\nThe freshman, with an equal show of reason, resisted the strongarm methods of the sophs. No man wants to be humiliated before a crowd of two thousand people. The resulting fight was<br />\nunquestionably disgraceful, but not all of the blame can be laid<br />\nupon either of the principals. They were to some extent the victims of circumstance; the system itself is at fault.<br />\nIt is remarkable that no serious trouble has occurred before.<br />\nFootball games are not the place to enforce regulations. Outsiders who come to the games pay their admission to see a football game, not to watch the punishment of unruly freshmen.<br />\nMany of them do not understand what such occasions mean; they<br />\nnever heard of regulations or have the slightest inkling of their<br />\nsignificance. Naturally they look upon the activities of the Pep<br />\nCommittee as pure rowdyism. Also, from the point of view of a<br />\nfreshman punishment which under ordinary conditions would be<br />\naccepted as just becomes ten times as bitter when administered<br />\nbefore a large audience.<br />\nWe do not mean that regulations should not be in effect during games, but merely that they should not be enforced there.<br />\nThe Pep Committee could very easily make out a list of all freshmen ,breaking regulations. These offenders could be summoned<br />\nat the beginning of the next week, perhaps a double share of punishment should be meted out to them. At all events, however,<br />\nsome method must be adopted to remove the necessity of washing<br />\nour dirty linen in public.<br /><br />\nAs you have probably guessed by this time, we think we are<br />\na very bored, sophisticated, thrilless undergrad, but we received<br />\nwhat we consider the supreme thrill a few evenings ago while<br />\nsupping at the Barn. We were sitting at a table by ourselves,<br />\nmusing aimlessly and deeply absorbed in fantastic reverie when<br />\nwe were rudely interrupted by a female voice from behind piping,<br />\n\"Vernon, who is this D. H.

We hate to put ourselves in the light of an<br />\neavesdropper, but a conversation we happened to overhear one<br />\nevening while returning via United Railways from Dr. Boas's<br />\nlecture on French Philosophy of the Nineteenth Century is just<br />\na bit too typical to leave unprinted.
