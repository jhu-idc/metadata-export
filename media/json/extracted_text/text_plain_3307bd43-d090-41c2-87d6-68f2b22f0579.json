Bertrand R.ussell, the noted English philosopher who is lecturing..in this country, said recently in an interview reported in<br />\nTlie.New Student that \"if you cannot liberalize the student, there<br />\nis no hope for America. . . . There is too much, tendency in<br />\nthis cOnntry for liberals to sit around and talk only. It is not<br />\ngood for a man of 20 to sit around and think all of the world's<br />\nproblems are solved.\"<br />\nIf Mr. Russell believes that the average undergraduate in the<br />\nAmerican college can be liberalized to the point where he is seriously-interested in world problems, he is an optimist indeed. Most<br />\ncollege students would not claim to think that all of the world's<br />\nproblems are solved, but they do not care whether they are solved<br />\nor not. And beyond the issues which strike home to them personally\u2014e. g., the prohibition question\u2014they know little or care<br />\nlittle.abOut even national problems.<br />\nThe av.erage college undergraduate finds himself in a miniature<br />\nworld :of his own, the complexities of which differ only in degree<br />\nfrom those of the world into which he suddenly finds himself<br />\nprecipitated after his education has been \"completed.\" He takes<br />\nhis four years of college more or less for granted, particularly<br />\nif he does not have to, work his way through. His exposure to<br />\nthe problems that grip the world around him is usually limited to<br />\na cursory scanning of the daily newspaper or an occasional plunge<br />\ninto the depths of one of the so-called \"intellectual\" magazines.<br />\nFew .of the bugaboos that haunt people all over the world come<br />\nwithin his. orbit, except occasionally as curious bits of the day's<br />\nnews. It is going to be a difficult task to \"liberalize\" the American<br />\nstudent:<br />\nIt would be difficult, because most college students realize how<br />\neasy it is.for average fairly intelligent Americans to achieve financial success. Liberals\u2014that is, among people who are not inordinately unselfish\u2014are not made from those who are or can be materially satisfied easily. They may be imbued with certain liberal<br />\nideas, and may even believe in the efficacy of certain liberal doctrines, but belief is the limit.<br />\nMr. Russell also says in the same interview that American liberals are \"too unrealistic and unwilling to face the facts.\" The<br />\ntrouble is that most Americans are too realistic and cannot see<br />\nbeyond those facts which present themselves to immediate perception. American students are, after all, pre-eminently Americans,<br />\nand consequently are the heirs to all the foibles and weaknesses<br />\nthat are attributable to Americans as a nation.<br />\n<br />\nFor all words are weapons, and silence is a vulnerable shield.<br />\nThe blunt man lays about him with a mallet, or if he be pacific,<br />\nhe counters heavily, and sharp, subtle stinging darts are smashed<br />\nand shattered by his crude hammer blows. Blunt men have<br />\nbruised me most with their words; I am stunned by one solid rap,<br />\nand when at last I prepare to draw my sword it is too late; it<br />\nsqueaks in the scabbard, and silence reigns.<br />\nVoltaire\u2014yes, I know it's been said before\u2014used a rapier; the<br />\nbest people do.

There are many men<br />\nwho wander through life with slim, glittering foils ever in hand;<br />\nthey are the men who create through annihilation, who stab the<br />\nstolid heart of the bourgeois and are hated and admired for their<br />\ndiabolical agility.<br />\nA subtler and usually a less effective weapon is the poets. Slow<br />\npoisoning is usually the method of these monsters, who slyly pour<br />\ntheir deadly drops into the warm and tantalizing wines they brew,<br />\nso that the crime is done artistically. Death, madness, stupor<br />\nor absurdity often result; there are those, however, who are said<br />\nto be impervious to this weapon, and who scorn the methods and<br />\ntheir employers.<br />\nOur Cal is unique in a preference for pins; their cheapness,<br />\ntheir quantity, or the fact that they help to conceal nakedness even<br />\nwhile they irritate, may explain this.<br />\nThe Y.

They state,<br />\nin the report, that \"A conservative<br />\nestimate of receipts was balanced<br />\nagainst a liberal estimate of expenditures\" in the drawing up of<br />\ntheir budget.<br />\nFrom the experience of other<br />\nyears a gate receipt of $800 was<br />\nconsidered a conservative figure; the<br />\nreceipts totaled only about $300,<br />\nwhich, of course,. was enough in<br />\nitself to account for more than the<br />\ndeficit. Added to this was the very<br />\nlow gate receipt on Alumni Night,<br />\nso that the deficit being only $401,<br />\ngives proof to the fact that the rest<br />\nof the receipt items had been treated<br />\nconservatively.<br />\nEight Suggestions<br />\n<br />\nBecause of the experience of the<br />\n1927 June Week Committee, they<br />\nsubmitted the following recommendations:<br />\n1.

But<br />\nMonday the main line of the B. & 0. was cleared for a through<br />\ntrip and the British locomotive went into action.<br />\nStarting its 543-ton train of coaches from Camden Station that<br />\nmorning without the slightest bit of jerkiness, the King George V<br />\nmoved smoothly down the tracks, showing no outward sign of the<br />\nstrain of power in those prettily-painted cylinders. The engine<br />\ngradually gathered momentum, and in a few minutes was swinging along toward Washington. Through the \"bad lands\" on the<br />\noutskirts of the city, past the fair grounds at Halethorpe, over<br />\nthe Carrollton viaduct near Relay, it rolled on toward Washington,<br />\nincreasing its speed as the British engineer opened the throttle.<br />\nIn the dynamometer car, directly behind the tender, sat a number<br />\nof ralroad men intently watching various scientific instruments<br />\nrecording the number of feet traveled per second, the draw-bar<br />\npull, the boiler - pressure, and other power and distance measurements.<br />\nThen came the thrill. The dial indicator registered 70 miles<br />\nper hour. A spirit of tenseness showed itself in the faces of the<br />\nmen in the car. After all, this was a brand new engine, not yet<br />\ntuned in service, running on strange rails. Anything might<br />\nhappen.<br />\nThe hand of the dial moved again and electric pens, magnetically<br />\ncontrolled and writing on a chart, clicked off more than 100 feet<br />\na second\u2014seventy-six miles an hour! The rhythmic rattle of the<br />\ncoaches merged into a steady hu.m. Booming on the up-grade,<br />\nthe Capitol Limited shot past in one dark streak.

There were questionable curves<br />\nahead. One of the tense faces in the dynamometer car suddenly<br />\nopened its mouth in terse comment: \"Too damned fast. Better<br />\ncut it down some.\"<br />\nThe warning was telephoned to the cab and the train slowed<br />\ndown to a more moderate pace. That maximum speed was not<br />\nreached again, neither on the return to Baltimore nor on the round<br />\n<br />\npre-war<br />\n<br />\ntrip to Philadelphia.<br />\nThe first thrill was over, but the novelty refused to wear off,<br />\nfor there was plenty of food for thought to sustain the interest<br />\nof the trip. A little over a century ago, a dinky little steam<br />\nengine, the \"Stourbridge Lion,\" was sent to these shores from<br />\nEngland\u2014the first locomotive to run on rails in America. And<br />\nhere now was another British engine, at the other end of the scale,<br />\nthe last word in modern stearn power in Europe, again hauling<br />\nan American train. A pleasant occupation to glance back over<br />\nthe perspective of a hundred years and picture in the mind's eye<br />\nthe successive stages bridging the vast gap between these two<br />\niron horses.<br />\nOther associated ideas kept drawing up for review\u2014the striking differences, for instance, between the English engine and the<br />\ntypical American locomotive. The latter is usually described in<br />\nappearance as monster-like, massive, overwhelming, formidable;<br />\nwhile the \"King George V\" reminds one more of the greyhound,<br />\nsleek, trim, slender, its potential resources hidden beneath the<br />\nsurface. The English locomotive has no bell, no headlight and<br />\nnone of the other complicated safety devices required in this<br />\ncountry, which gives the locomotive here its formidable aspect.<br />\nThe \"King George V,\" painted bright green and gold, with<br />\nsimple lines and rounded edges, looks like some great toy when<br />\nplaced beside a President engine of the Capitol Limited, which<br />\nhas a more rugged symmetry. In point of performance, there is<br />\nnot much basis for comparison between the two engines, for the<br />\nrailroad problems of England and the United States are widely<br />\ndivergent because of geographical differences. England has none<br />\nof the steep mountain grades and curves of this country.<br />\nIn addition to the dynamometer car, the \"King George V\"<br />\npulled three individual seat coaches, two Pullman cars and an<br />\nofficial observation car\u2014a train heavier by 50 tons than the<br />\naverage large passenger train run in England.<br />\nAltogether, it was an unusual and entertaining trip\u2014a novel<br />\nvariation, in a new key, of the song of the twin-track trail.<br />\n<br />\netothe5<br />\nlurni5bino<br />\niimtg<br />\n*boeg<br />\n<br />\nCAHN'S<br />\n<br />\n5<br />\n<br />\nHOP<br />\nUAUTY Clothes<br />\n<br />\n\"Wettnp\"<br />\nNopnton\u2014<br />\n<br />\n-Collar-Hug\"<br />\n<br />\nBaltimore and LibertySts.<br />\n<br />\nHopkins<br />\nRepresentative<br />\n<br />\n2000 Suitsduort!trIg Anniversary Sale<br />\n$28<br />\nAfter Sale $35<br />\nSNAPPY COLLEGIATE MODELS<br />\n<br />\n5TEWART1141r<br />\nIx Caro., it. ow AUCP\u2022er, 0.C*, New Yr.&<br />\n<br />\nIIOWARD AND LEXINGTON STREETS<br />\n<br />\nau do gei More<br />\nMilea5e Fro<br />\nMILES OFSMILES<br />\n<br />\n\f", "format": "basic_html", "processed": "tn<br /><br />\nVOL.

Bertrand R.ussell, the noted English philosopher who is lecturing..in this country, said recently in an interview reported in<br />\nTlie.New Student that \"if you cannot liberalize the student, there<br />\nis no hope for America. . . . There is too much, tendency in<br />\nthis cOnntry for liberals to sit around and talk only. It is not<br />\ngood for a man of 20 to sit around and think all of the world's<br />\nproblems are solved.\"<br />\nIf Mr. Russell believes that the average undergraduate in the<br />\nAmerican college can be liberalized to the point where he is seriously-interested in world problems, he is an optimist indeed. Most<br />\ncollege students would not claim to think that all of the world's<br />\nproblems are solved, but they do not care whether they are solved<br />\nor not. And beyond the issues which strike home to them personally\u2014e. g., the prohibition question\u2014they know little or care<br />\nlittle.abOut even national problems.<br />\nThe av.erage college undergraduate finds himself in a miniature<br />\nworld :of his own, the complexities of which differ only in degree<br />\nfrom those of the world into which he suddenly finds himself<br />\nprecipitated after his education has been \"completed.\" He takes<br />\nhis four years of college more or less for granted, particularly<br />\nif he does not have to, work his way through. His exposure to<br />\nthe problems that grip the world around him is usually limited to<br />\na cursory scanning of the daily newspaper or an occasional plunge<br />\ninto the depths of one of the so-called \"intellectual\" magazines.<br />\nFew .of the bugaboos that haunt people all over the world come<br />\nwithin his. orbit, except occasionally as curious bits of the day's<br />\nnews. It is going to be a difficult task to \"liberalize\" the American<br />\nstudent:<br />\nIt would be difficult, because most college students realize how<br />\neasy it is.for average fairly intelligent Americans to achieve financial success. Liberals\u2014that is, among people who are not inordinately unselfish\u2014are not made from those who are or can be materially satisfied easily. They may be imbued with certain liberal<br />\nideas, and may even believe in the efficacy of certain liberal doctrines, but belief is the limit.<br />\nMr. Russell also says in the same interview that American liberals are \"too unrealistic and unwilling to face the facts.\" The<br />\ntrouble is that most Americans are too realistic and cannot see<br />\nbeyond those facts which present themselves to immediate perception. American students are, after all, pre-eminently Americans,<br />\nand consequently are the heirs to all the foibles and weaknesses<br />\nthat are attributable to Americans as a nation.<br /><br />\nFor all words are weapons, and silence is a vulnerable shield.<br />\nThe blunt man lays about him with a mallet, or if he be pacific,<br />\nhe counters heavily, and sharp, subtle stinging darts are smashed<br />\nand shattered by his crude hammer blows.

Slow<br />\npoisoning is usually the method of these monsters, who slyly pour<br />\ntheir deadly drops into the warm and tantalizing wines they brew,<br />\nso that the crime is done artistically.

But due to the<br />\npost-season game with Oglethorpe,<br />\nDecember 17 appears as the logical<br />\ndate.<br />\nThe nature of the rush was also<br />\nbrought up, but nothing definite was<br />\ndecided, although several suggestions, some of which 'varied greatly<br />\nfrom last year's mud-and-garbage<br />\nbattle, were made.<br /><br />\nSophomore Class<br />\nWill Meet Today<br /><br />\nInc.<br /><br />\nEstablished 1817<br /><br />\nJEWELERS AND<br />\nSILVERSMITHS<br />\nCharles and Franklin Streets<br /><br />\nce\u2022-\u2022t..0<br />\nwi4w<br />\nev,<br />\ni<br />\nlifite<br />\neve<br />\nr itt<br />\nryst<br />\n,,,, :.....01....,1 \u2022<br />\n.........twairrii<br />\nWel<br />\n\u202241<br />\n. tk,\"3/<br /><br />\nNo Date For Class Rush<br /><br />\nThe sophomore class will hold an<br />\nimportant meeting today in the Civil<br />\nEngineering Building at 12.30,<br />\nPurnell Hall, president of the second-year students, announced.<br />\nAccording to Hall, the purpose of<br />\nthis meeting will be to elect captains and managers of the various<br />\nathletic teams.

Albert Abraham, treasurer of the committee,<br />\nattributed the deficit to over calculation on the receipts of Alumni Night<br />\nand of the Senior Ball. They state,<br />\nin the report, that \"A conservative<br />\nestimate of receipts was balanced<br />\nagainst a liberal estimate of expenditures\" in the drawing up of<br />\ntheir budget.<br />\nFrom the experience of other<br />\nyears a gate receipt of $800 was<br />\nconsidered a conservative figure; the<br />\nreceipts totaled only about $300,<br />\nwhich, of course,. was enough in<br />\nitself to account for more than the<br />\ndeficit. Added to this was the very<br />\nlow gate receipt on Alumni Night,<br />\nso that the deficit being only $401,<br />\ngives proof to the fact that the rest<br />\nof the receipt items had been treated<br />\nconservatively.<br />\nEight Suggestions<br /><br />\nBecause of the experience of the<br />\n1927 June Week Committee, they<br />\nsubmitted the following recommendations:<br />\n1. That June Week be a more<br />\ncomplete Hopkins affair.<br />\n2. A reduction in the cost of<br />\nthe Senior Ball.<br />\n3. Reduction in admission price<br />\nof Senior Ball.<br />\n4. Elimination of lacrosse game.<br />\n5. Earlier Alumni campaign.<br />\n6. A reduction in the cost of<br />\nprinting.<br />\n7. A reduction in the cost of<br />\nbooklet programmes.<br />\n8.

But<br />\nMonday the main line of the B. &amp; 0. was cleared for a through<br />\ntrip and the British locomotive went into action.<br />\nStarting its 543-ton train of coaches from Camden Station that<br />\nmorning without the slightest bit of jerkiness, the King George V<br />\nmoved smoothly down the tracks, showing no outward sign of the<br />\nstrain of power in those prettily-painted cylinders. The engine<br />\ngradually gathered momentum, and in a few minutes was swinging along toward Washington. Through the \"bad lands\" on the<br />\noutskirts of the city, past the fair grounds at Halethorpe, over<br />\nthe Carrollton viaduct near Relay, it rolled on toward Washington,<br />\nincreasing its speed as the British engineer opened the throttle.<br />\nIn the dynamometer car, directly behind the tender, sat a number<br />\nof ralroad men intently watching various scientific instruments<br />\nrecording the number of feet traveled per second, the draw-bar<br />\npull, the boiler - pressure, and other power and distance measurements.<br />\nThen came the thrill. The dial indicator registered 70 miles<br />\nper hour. A spirit of tenseness showed itself in the faces of the<br />\nmen in the car. After all, this was a brand new engine, not yet<br />\ntuned in service, running on strange rails. Anything might<br />\nhappen.<br />\nThe hand of the dial moved again and electric pens, magnetically<br />\ncontrolled and writing on a chart, clicked off more than 100 feet<br />\na second\u2014seventy-six miles an hour! The rhythmic rattle of the<br />\ncoaches merged into a steady hu.m. Booming on the up-grade,<br />\nthe Capitol Limited shot past in one dark streak. Telephone poles<br />\ncame and went with a swift, rigid motion. On the other side, a<br />\nblurred freight train roared by, its cars a rapid succession of<br />\nflashes. The throttle was seventy-five per cent open, sending<br /><br />\nJONES CHEVROLET<br />\nSALES COMPANY<br />\n\"A Friendly Organization\"<br />\nChevrolet Models<br />\nTouring\u2014Disc wheels<br />\nTouring\u2014Wood wheels<br />\nRoadster\u2014Disc wheels..<br />\nRoadster\u2014Wood wheels<br />\nCoach\u2014Disc wheels<br />\nCoupe\u2014Disc wheels.<br />\nSedan\u2014Disc wheels<br />\nLandau\u2014Disc wheels<br />\nImperial\u2014Disc wheels<br />\nCabriolet\u2014Disc wheels<br /><br />\n$525 Attractive Terms<br />\n$535<br />\n$525<br />\n$535 We Will Trade<br />\n$595<br />\nYour Old Car<br />\n$625<br />\n$695<br />\n$745<br />\n$745 Open Every Day<br />\n$715<br />\nUntil 10 P.

There were questionable curves<br />\nahead. One of the tense faces in the dynamometer car suddenly<br />\nopened its mouth in terse comment: \"Too damned fast. Better<br />\ncut it down some.\"<br />\nThe warning was telephoned to the cab and the train slowed<br />\ndown to a more moderate pace. That maximum speed was not<br />\nreached again, neither on the return to Baltimore nor on the round<br /><br />\npre-war<br /><br />\ntrip to Philadelphia.<br />\nThe first thrill was over, but the novelty refused to wear off,<br />\nfor there was plenty of food for thought to sustain the interest<br />\nof the trip. A little over a century ago, a dinky little steam<br />\nengine, the \"Stourbridge Lion,\" was sent to these shores from<br />\nEngland\u2014the first locomotive to run on rails in America. And<br />\nhere now was another British engine, at the other end of the scale,<br />\nthe last word in modern stearn power in Europe, again hauling<br />\nan American train. A pleasant occupation to glance back over<br />\nthe perspective of a hundred years and picture in the mind's eye<br />\nthe successive stages bridging the vast gap between these two<br />\niron horses.<br />\nOther associated ideas kept drawing up for review\u2014the striking differences, for instance, between the English engine and the<br />\ntypical American locomotive. The latter is usually described in<br />\nappearance as monster-like, massive, overwhelming, formidable;<br />\nwhile the \"King George V\" reminds one more of the greyhound,<br />\nsleek, trim, slender, its potential resources hidden beneath the<br />\nsurface. The English locomotive has no bell, no headlight and<br />\nnone of the other complicated safety devices required in this<br />\ncountry, which gives the locomotive here its formidable aspect.<br />\nThe \"King George V,\" painted bright green and gold, with<br />\nsimple lines and rounded edges, looks like some great toy when<br />\nplaced beside a President engine of the Capitol Limited, which<br />\nhas a more rugged symmetry. In point of performance, there is<br />\nnot much basis for comparison between the two engines, for the<br />\nrailroad problems of England and the United States are widely<br />\ndivergent because of geographical differences.
