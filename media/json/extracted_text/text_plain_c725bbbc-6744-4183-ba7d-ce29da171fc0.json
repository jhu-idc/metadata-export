Of<br />\nthis four it happened that exactly<br />\none hundred per cent were members<br />\nof the fair sex.<br />\n<br />\nNumerous excited comments and<br />\nqueries were recently being passed<br />\naround the campus of the University of Kansas when thirty-one<br />\npledges were officially detained by<br />\nthe police while engaged in sonic of<br />\nthose duties which are the necessary<br />\nelements of \"hell week\" or fraternity initiations. As a result the student council of the University has<br />\nfiled a protest with the city officials<br />\ncomplaining against the drastic action.<br />\n<br />\nA verbal chastisement was recently presented the student body of<br />\nOhio Wesleyan by the faculty of<br />\nthat institution. It seems as though<br />\nthe students have been allowed so<br />\nmuch authority of late that they<br />\nhave gone so far as to suggest that<br />\nthey be allowed admittance to faculty proceedings.<br />\nThe President<br />\nsummed up the situation by rather<br />\nsarcastically stating that the .students were \"too busy running the<br />\nUniversity.\"<br />\n<br />\n(<br />\n<br />\nA petition of 116 students of Boston University was recently presented to the Dean, requesting that<br />\nbridge playing between classes<br />\nshould be countenanced.
