Asta<br />\n\"Roots: Two Ideas of Interpretation,\" was tne topic of the<br />\n1985 G. Harry Pouder<br />\nMemorial Lecture, given this<br />\npast Wednesday by Umberto<br />\nEco, novelist and scholar. Eco<br />\nis a professor at the University<br />\nof Bologna and author of the<br />\nbestselling novel The Name of<br />\nthe Rose.<br />\nBorn in Alessandria, Italy,<br />\nEco is currently a professor of<br />\nsemiotics, the analysis of the<br />\nrelationships of sign and symbols in language, at the University of Bologna. Eco is the first<br />\nperson to hold such a chair at<br />\nany university.<br />\nHis early works include a<br />\nbook on medieval asthetics,<br />\nOpera Aperta, and a pioneer<br />\nstudy in semiotics, La Struttura<br />\nAssente. He is the secretary<br />\ngeneral of the International<br />\nAssociation for Semiotic<br />\nStudies, the editor of VS and an<br />\neminent critic of James Joyce.<br />\nHis recent publications in<br />\nEnglish include A Theory of<br />\nSemiotics, and The Role of The<br />\nReader: Explorations in the<br />\nSemiotics of Texts. He is probably familiar to most<br />\nAmericans for his first novel,<br />\n<br />\nThe Name of the Rose, which<br />\nwas published in the United<br />\nStates in 1983, and subsequently became a bestseller.<br />\nProfessor Eco noted that<br />\nthere may have been a<br />\nmisunderstanding stemming<br />\nfrom the titling of his lecture.<br />\nHe stated that it had nothing to<br />\ndo with the concept of ancestry,<br />\nas the word 'roots' is often<br />\ntaken to mean, because of Alex<br />\nHaley's novel.<br />\nHis lecture was a treatment<br />\nof the classical dispute between<br />\nthe meaning intended to a piece<br />\nof writing and the meaning interpreted by the reader. These<br />\ntwo stances are, according to<br />\nEco, \"interpretive phanticism.\"<br />\nSaid Eco, \"The tracing of<br />\nthese two viewpoints to an intermediate position is done by<br />\nfollowing the intended meaning<br />\nforwards and the implicated<br />\nmeaning backwards.\" Added<br />\nEco,\"These poles and their interpretations, have influenced<br />\nmodern criticism.<br />\nThe intermediate position<br />\nwas broken down into two<br />\nterms: symbolism and allegory.<br />\n\"Symbolism is defined as<br />\nsomething that is representative,\" stated Eco. \"Sym-<br />\n<br />\nTutu Lecture Set For<br />\nJanuary at Hopkins<br />\nContinued Irom l'age I<br />\nin their love and hurl!anity,\"<br />\nexplained Watkins.<br />\nWhen Tutu accepted the invitation however, he expressed<br />\nconcern about possible attempts by the South African<br />\ngovernment to detain him.<br />\nTwice before, Tutu's passport<br />\nwas seized by the South African<br />\ngovernment and he has been<br />\nforced to travel with documents<br />\ndescribing his nationality as<br />\n\"undetermined\" for the past<br />\nfour years.<br />\n<br />\n\"If he doesn't come, we'd<br />\nconsider a number of other<br />\npeople,\" Watkins said.

Eco spoke on the topic 'Roots: Two Ideas of Interpretation' at the occasion of the G. Hart, Pouder Memorial Lecture.<br />\n<br />\nbolism, because of its nature, is<br />\npurposely imprecise, nebulous,<br />\nand unexploitable,\" added<br />\nEco. \"It is inadequate in expressing everything fully. Its<br />\nambiguity is brought to height<br />\nin the romantic sense and in<br />\nmathematics,\" continued Eco.<br />\n\"The word 'symbol' is denyed from the Greek, \"stated<br />\nEco. It originally referred to a<br />\npiece of something that recalled the whole. Eco said,\"An example is a ticket stub given at<br />\na theatre performance. All<br />\ncomprehend its meaning and<br />\nfunction as bestowing attendance.\"<br />\nIn discussing allegory, Eco<br />\nnoted, \"The classical sense of<br />\n'symbol' was quite synonymous<br />\nwith 'allegory.' They were both<br />\npart of the unknown, and so<br />\neach was used to explain God<br />\nand the writings of scripture.\"<br />\nScriptural interpretations<br />\ncenter around the Old and New<br />\nTestament. \"The Old Testament is the signifier,\" stated<br />\nEco,\"while the New Testament<br />\nis a letter of moral duties.\"<br />\n\"The Scriptures have the<br />\n3120 St. Paul<br />\nHAIR (e- 2.35.0741<br />\nUN LINII\"TEI)<br />\n<br />\nOPEN MONDAY<br />\n1 Till 6<br />\nTUES - SAT<br />\n10 Till 6<br />\n<br />\nHair Cutting -Henna -Frosting<br />\nPerms & Body Waves<br />\nSpecial Children's Rates<br />\n<br />\nSTOP SWEAT<br />\nFOR 6 WEEKS<br />\n<br />\npotential to say everything, but<br />\nthey have been pored over by<br />\npersons looking for only one<br />\nthing,\" Eco continued. \"Every<br />\npossible meaning in the Scriptures is governed by a code in<br />\nthe allegorical sense. Its interpretation on the literal,<br />\nallegorical, moral, and mystical<br />\nmeanings.\"<br />\nThe Scriptures have been<br />\nlikened to an ocean or \"an infinite forest of senses,''<br />\ntranslated Eco from St.<br />\nJerome. Their truths are phrased many ways: \"same thing,<br />\nsame game, different ways,\"<br />\nremarked Eco.<br />\nEco also discussed the role of<br />\nSt. Augustine in determining<br />\nwhen to recognize a symbol.

The committee has<br />\ndone its job, some will say, so the issue<br />\nis closed. Wrong. The issue is just now<br />\ncoming into its most critical moment.<br />\nThe administration needs to act\u2014<br />\nquickly\u2014on the report's worthwhile<br />\nrecommendations.<br />\nLet's first say the obvious: parts of the<br />\nreport are not only not worthwhile, they<br />\nare ridiculous. In particular, the report<br />\nadvocates the hiring of dozens of additional personnel. At a small university,<br />\nthat simply isn't possible; the money just<br />\nisn't there.<br />\nThe report says blithely, for example,<br />\nthat four new tenured faculty positions<br />\nought to be created specifically for<br />\nwomen. Leaving aside for the moment<br />\n<br />\nwhether or not that's a good idea, it's utterly unreasonable.<br />\nPerhaps the committtee members<br />\nthought that by asking for a mile they<br />\ncould bargain down to an inch. It's more<br />\nlikely people will disregard the report as<br />\nunrealistic rantings.<br />\nThat would be unfortunate, for there<br />\nis much in the report that makes a lot of<br />\nsense. In particular, we like the emphasis<br />\nplaced on increasing the number of<br />\nwomen on the faculty. Dean of the<br />\nSchool of Arts and Sciences George<br />\nFisher has said he and the other deans<br />\nwill appoint a committee to study the<br />\nreport's recommendations in that area.<br />\nBut why hasn't such a committee already<br />\nstarted working? Admittedly not much<br />\ncan be done in the summer, but the<br />\nacademic year is a month old. Fisher promises the committee in a few days. We'll<br />\nkeep an eye on him, but so should<br />\nstudents.<br />\nThe report's call for a day care center<br />\nalso deserves attention. Fisher says there<br />\nwill be \"conversations\" about the<br />\ncenter's establishment. He is indisputably honest, but that sounds like<br />\nfoot dragging. Recommendations on<br />\npublicizing the problems of sexual<br />\nharassment and improving educational<br />\nopportunities for employees are also<br />\nreasonable.<br />\nSo far, the administration has done<br />\nvirtually nothing to implement anything<br />\ncontained in the report. We'll grant that<br />\nit's early in the year, but visible progress<br />\nneeds to be made soon. At the same<br />\ntime, the committee should be chastised<br />\nfor having written a report which at<br />\ntimes is completely unrealistic. At this<br />\npoint, nobody has much to be proud of.<br />\n<br />\nA Day in the Park<br />\nRelations between Hopkins and the<br />\nsurrounding community have never been<br />\nexactly wonderful. After this summer's<br />\nbrouhaha over Wyman Park, they may<br />\nbe worse than ever.<br />\nIn short, the university asked permission to develop five acres of the park.<br />\nAdditional space is needed for research,<br />\nso the school planned to build two new<br />\noffice complexes. The mayor had apparently suggested the idea, but backed<br />\naway due to community uproar.<br />\nThe community claimed the university didn't really need the land, and argued<br />\nthe park is a valuable asset to the area.<br />\nThe matter is to be resolved this<br />\nmonth.<br />\nWhatever the outcome, it seems clear<br />\nthe university committed a public relations blunder.<br />\nPresumably the timing of the move\u2014<br />\nsmack in the middle of the summer\u2014<br />\nwas thought to be beneficial. Students<br />\nand faculty, the two university-connected<br />\ngroups most likely to sympathize with<br />\nthe community, would be out of touch<br />\nwith the school; many community<br />\nmembers would be on vacation. In<br />\n<br />\nretrospect, though, the timing could not<br />\nhave been worse. It looked as if the<br />\nuniversity was trying to sneak one by<br />\neverybody.<br />\nThen, in attempting to make matters<br />\nbetter, University President Steven<br />\nMuller may have made them worse. In<br />\na letter to The Sun (which is reprinted<br />\non the page opposite), he included a<br />\npreachy reference to the dictionary that<br />\ncould only have served to anger more<br />\npeople.<br />\nThe matter is a serious one because<br />\nHopkins has often had trouble with the<br />\nrest of Baltimore in the past. That isn't<br />\ntoo surprising\u2014Hopkins is clearly a bastion of upper-class privilege in a profoundly middle class area, and students<br />\nno doubt often come off as arrogant<br />\nsmart alecks. In that sense, no matter<br />\nwhat the university does, some members<br />\nof the community won't like it.<br />\nStill, there was no reason for Hopkins<br />\nto antagonize so many people with its<br />\nmove to take over the park. Handled<br />\ncorrectly, the expansion could have come<br />\noff smoothly.<br />\n<br />\nTwo weeks ago in an article a student-run station to a highon Brad Marks' Public Interest power professionally managed<br />\nInvestment Advisory Commit- operation took place with little<br />\ntee report to the Student Coun- consideration to student input.<br />\ncil, I wrote that Marks said he As far as I know, no one asked<br />\ndid not know much about a undergraduates if they wanted<br />\nresolution University President a third Homewood dean. ConMuller submitted to the cerning JHU's possible<br />\nTrustees concerning investment takeover of Wyman Park,<br />\nin South Africa. I quoted Brad students are invariably the last<br />\nto say: \"Muller sometimes to know what's going on.<br />\nBut then again, Hopkins adforgets to clear these things<br />\nthrough me.\" He made the ministrators cannot listen to<br />\nremark in jest, of course, and our concerns if we don't voice<br />\nit was in that spirit that I includ- them. The administration con-<br />\n<br />\nbill riesen<br />\ned it in the article.

PIIAC submitted a<br />\nresolution of its own concerning divestment last spring, and<br />\nit is not clear whether Muller's<br />\nproposal mirrors it, falls short<br />\nof it, goes beyond it, or opposes<br />\nit completely. The message is<br />\nclear in any case: what students<br />\nhave to say does not matter in<br />\nhigh-level university decisions.<br />\nMuller's resolution is only<br />\none instance of when the<br />\npowers that be at Hopkins<br />\n\"sometimes forget to clear<br />\nthese things\" with the students.<br />\nThe conversion of WJHU from<br />\n<br />\nstantly<br />\nthat<br />\nstresses<br />\nundergraduate education is only a small (and apparently inconsequential) part of a university that also includes a hospital<br />\nand medical school, SAIS, the<br />\nApplied Physics Lab, and<br />\nresearch of all sorts. We cannot<br />\ntacitly accept this implication<br />\nthat undergraduates are unimportant at Johns Hopkins. Instead, we must make our views<br />\ncount\u2014after all, it's our<br />\nschool.<br />\nIf you care about investment<br />\nin South Africa or weapons<br />\nmanufacture, talk to Brad<br />\nMarks. If you have something<br />\nto say about some other aspect<br />\nof Hopkins, talk to your Student Council representatives or<br />\nthe Homewood deans.

It was designed to<br />\npublicize the current controversy over the park. Members of<br />\nthe Hopkins community should<br />\nhave taken a look if only to find<br />\nout what all the fuss is about.<br />\nThe \"fuss\" began last July<br />\n17th when President Muller<br />\n(apparently encouraged by<br />\nMayor Schaefer) requested that<br />\nthe city turn over Wyman Park<br />\nto the university for development. The Park Board (appointed by the Mayor) appeared ready to act within three<br />\nweeks.

Perhaps Kadri is simply<br />\nreferring to views on the politics<br />\nof the Federal government, but<br />\nthe resolution makes no mention of the policies of the<br />\nFederal government, only the<br />\nissue of apartheid.

The sacrifice of park<br />\nspace to any particular interest,<br />\nif it is to be contemplated at all,<br />\nshould be a very last resort. So<br />\nsay many of the concerned<br />\ncitizens of Baltimore.<br />\nThe University, on the other<br />\nhand, claims it needs space to<br />\nexpand and accomodate affiliated institutions. None of<br />\nthe community people I know<br />\nquestions the right of the<br />\nUniversity to expand although<br />\nthere are many faculty who<br />\nworry that we are straying too<br />\nfar from the conception of a<br />\nuniversity and too close to a<br />\nmultinational R & D corporation for our own comfort. Be<br />\nthat as it may, the University's<br />\ndemand for public space poses<br />\ntwo immediate questions:<br />\n\u2022 Is there a way to find that<br />\nspace within the confines of the<br />\nexisting campus? The answer is<br />\nobviously \"yes\" though not<br />\nwithout some sacrifice of<br />\nperhaps<br />\nand<br />\namenities<br />\naesthetics. Is it reasonable to<br />\nforce others to sacrifice their<br />\n<br />\namenities and aesthetics in<br />\norder to preserve our own?<br />\n\u2022 The University says it will<br />\ndevelop only five acres of the<br />\npark. Why then does it seek<br />\ncontrol over all thirty-five<br />\nacres? The suspicion lurks and<br />\nhistory teaches that more is at<br />\nstake than just those five acres.<br />\nOnce in control, the university<br />\nwill probably be as high-handed<br />\nin its decisions on the western<br />\nside of the park as it has been<br />\non the eastern side. And the<br />\ndecisions are often questionable. The present plan for<br />\nthe park is a case in point.<br />\nBuilding complexes at both the<br />\nsouth and north end of the park<br />\n(the latter armed with a 600 car<br />\nparking facility) are to be connected by a road that runs the<br />\nlength of the ravine and straddles the stream. That turns the<br />\npark into a parkway, does not<br />\na little environmental damage,<br />\nincrease noise and pollution,<br />\nand reduces the aesthetic value<br />\nof the stream and ravine to<br />\nnothing.<br />\nThe university claims it<br />\nwishes to develop the park as a<br />\n\"partly public\" facility integrated into the Homewood<br />\nCampus. Community people<br />\nare skeptical of that on a<br />\nnumber of grounds.<br />\nThe management of the part<br />\nof the park Hopkins does control is poor. Just look at the old<br />\ndesks and chairs tipped down<br />\ninto the ravine by the playing<br />\nfield, the filthy run-off (containing who knows what toxics)<br />\ninto Stony Run and the total<br />\nneglect of the Wyman Spring<br />\nand path.

He is entitles to his opinion but then so are those who<br />\nlike the park the way it is. How<br />\nare conflicts of that sort to be<br />\naired?<br />\nThe President now claims he<br />\nwants to work with the community to improve the park for<br />\nall. The community again has<br />\nreason to be skeptical. Experience teaches that the university never consults the community about major decisions<br />\n(the building of Olin Hall, the<br />\nSpace Telescope, the playing<br />\nfield, all on the university side<br />\nof the park).

When his<br />\nparents' plantation failed in<br />\n1932, he was forced to got to<br />\nwork in the mines, and by 1950<br />\nhad become the most powerful<br />\nof the notorious congoleum<br />\nmagnates, with over one hundred mines and a personal fortune in the millions.<br />\nChanging domestic conditions eventually forced him to<br />\nleave the newly-formed Zaire<br />\nand his newly-married French<br />\nbride, Baleine Beriberi; in 1954<br />\nvon Ruminaant left for the<br />\nUnited States on H.M.S.<br />\nRedolent (which wa, to fall<br />\nprey to the infamous \"Brain<br />\nTrauma Boys\" only a week<br />\nlater).<br />\n<br />\nWhen von Ruminaant landed in Baltimore, he took to<br />\n\"The Hopkins\" immediately.<br />\nWhen an overjoyed biology<br />\ndepartment discovered that he<br />\nspoke only Flemish, Afrikaans,<br />\nand Etruscan, he was given a<br />\nteaching assistantship in his<br />\nnew interest. By the end of the<br />\nfirst semester, he had overcome<br />\nhis severe cultural handicaps<br />\nand begun to fit in at the new<br />\nschool, carrying a set of basis<br />\nvectors in a pocket-protector<br />\nand shopping at Giant, using a<br />\nspecially engineered cart equipped with antiroll bars.

(Chief<br />\nJustice Marshall declared the<br />\nplaintiff, Marbury, to be legally 'repugnant' and therefore to<br />\nunable to sue in a United States<br />\ncourt.) He attempted to take a<br />\ndegree in Physics at this time<br />\n(1959), but was never taken<br />\nseriously due to an unfortunate<br />\nlack of facial hair.<br />\n<br />\nAlthough he lost his first fortune in the 1960's, wher, the<br />\ndevelopment of synthetic<br />\nlyssomes and effete and recursive polymers ended the days of<br />\nhigh-profit congoleum mining,<br />\nhe soon rebuilt in the importexport business.

After all, I had liked<br />\nthem back in the days when<br />\nthey probably couldn't have<br />\nfilled Shriver Hall, much less<br />\nthe Civic Center; I really<br />\nwanted to go see them, and I<br />\nwasn't going to let ten thousand<br />\n15-year-olds with paisley jeans<br />\nand perfectly moussed hair deter<br />\nme.<br />\nOn the bus to the concert, I<br />\nsuddenly realized that I had<br />\nforgotten to bring my good old<br />\nFlents earplugs. This was a major mistake.

Whiting School of<br />\nEngineering. This program<br />\nconsisted of renovation of<br />\nMaryland Hall and Latrobe<br />\nHall and the construction of a<br />\n10,000-square-foot addition to<br />\nLatrobe Hall. Both Maryland<br />\nand Latrobe Halls, built with a<br />\n$600,000 grant made by the<br />\nState of Maryland in 1912, are<br />\namong the oldest academic<br />\nbuildings on the Homewood<br />\ncampus.<br />\nThe renovation work that<br />\nwas done in Maryland Hall was<br />\ncentered on rebuilding the rear<br />\nwing of Maryland that was<br />\nknown as Machinery Hall.<br />\nMachinery Hall was itself a<br />\ntwo-story addition that provided lab space for professors who<br />\nrequired a large open area.<br />\nOver the years experiments of<br />\nall types had taken place in<br />\nMachinery Hall and slowly<br />\nthese experiments also took<br />\ntheir toll on the structure.<br />\nEverything from a large mass<br />\nof 18-inch thick concrete radio<br />\nfrequency shielding, to a wind<br />\ntunnel, to large pieces of<br />\nmachinery, and even a ceiling<br />\ncrane, had found itself in the<br />\nhall. With the 1977 deicision to<br />\nre-establish the School of<br />\nEngineering at Hopkins came<br />\nthe commitment to re-equip<br />\nthis new school. This commitment came to an early fruition<br />\nin the decision to renovate<br />\nMaryland Machinery Hall.<br />\nThe commitment, to return<br />\nengineering at Hopkins to its<br />\nearlier level of excellence, was<br />\naccompanied by the need to re-<br />\n<br />\nestablish two new departments,<br />\nCivil<br />\nEngineering<br />\nand<br />\nMechanical Engineering. The<br />\ncreation of these two departments, it was recognized, would<br />\ncreate a great need for additional lab and classroom space.<br />\nFortunately for the Whiting<br />\nSchool, just at the time that it<br />\nwas growing, the University<br />\nreceived a gift to build Olin<br />\nHall for the Department of<br />\nEarth and Planetary Sciences.<br />\nWith this department no longer<br />\nin Latrobe Hall, the Whiting<br />\nSchool had substantially more<br />\nspace. The long term use of<br />\nLatrobe Hall, however, required a major renovation of<br />\nthe entire structure. The need<br />\nfor even more space for<br />\nengineering was becoming apparent. Thus, when Dean V.<br />\nDavid VandeLinde developed<br />\nthe idea that the earth depression behind Latrobe Hall be<br />\nfilled in with an underground<br />\nlab wing the suggestion was<br />\ntaken seriously.<br />\nOne may wonder what were<br />\nsome of the events that created<br />\nthis need for more space. On<br />\nthe most fundamental level, it<br />\nwas a growth in the number of<br />\npeople<br />\nassociated<br />\nwith<br />\nengineering at Hopkins. In<br />\n1978, there were 363<br />\nundergraduates majoring in<br />\nengineering and 138 engineering<br />\ngraduate students. The 1983-84<br />\nschool<br />\nyear<br />\nsaw<br />\n597<br />\nundergraduates and 235<br />\ngraduate students in the fulltime program. Enrollment in<br />\nthe part-time engineering program saw the number of<br />\nmasters degree candidates double from the 1978 school year<br />\nto the present with more than<br />\n1,500 people now in the program. The number of faculty<br />\nmembers has grown by more<br />\nthan 30 since 1979.

Lee<br />\nThe track is cluttered with<br />\ngroups of silent young women.<br />\nThey all possess a purpose, an<br />\nunderstanding. Their common<br />\ngoal is to run 5,000 meters over<br />\ntough terrain and to run the<br />\ndistance as fast as each is<br />\ncapable on the given day. Of<br />\nthe several teams, one stands<br />\nout as calmer and more determined than the rest. This group<br />\nis the varsity Jay's Cross Country squad, a.k.a. The Magnificent Seven.<br />\nRunning their first home<br />\nmeet of the season, the Lady<br />\nJay's had to be victorious to<br />\ncontinue their winning streak.<br />\nLining up against competitors<br />\nfrom Swarthmore, Loyola,<br />\nCedar Crest and the Haverford/Bryn Mawr Cross Country Club, the Jay's felt the<br />\nweight on their shoulders. Most<br />\nof this burden lay on the<br />\nslender shoulders of pre-race<br />\nfavorite, Maureen Shea. Having proven herself in earlier<br />\nraces, Shea was going against<br />\nunknown challengers.<br />\nWatching the runners line up<br />\nfor the start on the track, one<br />\nis immersed in a sea of bright<br />\nforms. The teams stand side by<br />\nside, color by color, as they<br />\nawait the sound of the starter's<br />\ngun. This is total stillness until<br />\na shot releases the wave of colors. Runners charge for a narrow gate whose only purpose is<br />\nto impede the bulk of the pack.<br />\nOff quickly and in the lead, is<br />\nShea in fashionable Hopkins'<br />\nblue followed by frosh Molly<br />\nBardsley. The first mile is fast<br />\nas Shea leads the pack through<br />\nin 5:57. She runs as if possessed, with a distinctly unorthodox<br />\n<br />\nstride.<br />\nComing into the second mile,<br />\nShea is still in front with a 70meter lead over Betty Veronica<br />\nKraut from Bryn Mawr, who is<br />\nin turn followed by Bardsley.<br />\nHearing the second mile split,<br />\nthe runners are confused as the<br />\ntime told to them is extremely<br />\nfast. Apparently the time is inaccurate for the distance<br />\ncovered. As the pack runs on<br />\nfor the home stretch, coaches<br />\nEleanor Simonsick and Gary<br />\nGreen describe the opposition<br />\nas \"dropping like birds over industrial New Jersey.\"<br />\nBreaking the tape in 19:59 is<br />\nShea. She beats her nearest opponent by 120 meters. Quite an<br />\nimpressive victory for a<br />\nnewcomer with an inefficient<br />\nstride. Coming in third place is<br />\nBardsley fdllowed by Cecilia<br />\nKing in fifth place, Suzi<br />\nMcGinn in seventh place, Anita<br />\n<br />\nKim in eighth place, and Nonnie Estella in 15th place. By<br />\nplacing so many of their runners amongst the top finishers,<br />\nThe Magnificent Seven manage<br />\nto score shut-outs against opponents Loyola and Cedar<br />\nCrest and also defeat Swarthmore and Bryn MawrHaverford.<br />\nAfter such a satisfying victory, the Jay harriers are found<br />\naround the track in various<br />\nstates of physical depletion.<br />\nNevertheless, they are all in<br />\ngood spirits. Much of the<br />\nbackbone and spiritedness of<br />\nthis squad belongs to runners<br />\nsuch as Sarah Lazar and Emily<br />\nDeCoster who are dedicated<br />\ncompetitors if not always top<br />\nfinishers.

Again, the<br />\nJays completely controlled the<br />\ngame's play and outshot their<br />\nopponent 15-0. Two goals from<br />\n<br />\nCharlie Digby and single tallies<br />\nfrom Dave Gallo, Andy<br />\nNichols, Grenville Jones, and<br />\nCraig Weinstein accounted for<br />\nthe scoring in this lopsided affair. Goalies Eric Shaw and<br />\nGiuriceo combined to make<br />\nfive saves in the team's fourth<br />\nshutout of the year. Head<br />\nCoach William Tierney was<br />\nvery pleased with the team's<br />\nperformance and especially the<br />\nplay of senior tri-captain Dan<br />\nOlszewki.<br />\n\"Dan played by far his best<br />\ngame of the year,\" the coach<br />\nremarked. \"He's been a steady<br />\nplayer all season but he really<br />\ncame to life against York. He<br />\naccounted for an assist, but the<br />\nimportant things that he does<br />\nfor us don't show up in the<br />\nscoring column.\"<br />\nIf the defense continues to<br />\nstymie opponents and the scoring threats connect, one can only be led to believe that the<br />\n<br />\nHooters are playoff-bound.<br />\nThe squad has an excellent<br />\nbalance of youth and experience, and the upcoming<br />\ngames should be a good<br />\nmeasuring stick of just how<br />\nstrong the Jays really are.<br />\nCoach Tierney wants to take<br />\none game at a time rather than<br />\nlook ahead.<br />\n\"We're in a good positon<br />\nnow,\" Tierney remarked. \"The<br />\nattitude and depth of talent on<br />\nthis team are both excellent.<br />\nWith successive wins, we gain<br />\nconfidence and place ourselves<br />\nin a better positon to realize our<br />\ngoals.

She's listed as a setter,<br />\nbut in actuality she serves as<br />\nboth a setter and a hitter.<br />\n\"Everything Ilga does, she does<br />\nwell,\" said Finnessy.<br />\nCelmins is joined in the starting lineup by juniors Debbi<br />\nOlson and Susie Stickney,<br />\nsophomore Ashi Rafi, and<br />\nFrosh Ayesha Rook, Allison<br />\nUnger, and Jacki Mazarella.<br />\nAccording to Finnessy, \"Debbie, Susie, and Ashi have all<br />\nprogressed a great deal.

Asta<br />\n\"Roots: Two Ideas of Interpretation,\" was tne topic of the<br />\n1985 G. Harry Pouder<br />\nMemorial Lecture, given this<br />\npast Wednesday by Umberto<br />\nEco, novelist and scholar. Eco<br />\nis a professor at the University<br />\nof Bologna and author of the<br />\nbestselling novel The Name of<br />\nthe Rose.<br />\nBorn in Alessandria, Italy,<br />\nEco is currently a professor of<br />\nsemiotics, the analysis of the<br />\nrelationships of sign and symbols in language, at the University of Bologna. Eco is the first<br />\nperson to hold such a chair at<br />\nany university.<br />\nHis early works include a<br />\nbook on medieval asthetics,<br />\nOpera Aperta, and a pioneer<br />\nstudy in semiotics, La Struttura<br />\nAssente. He is the secretary<br />\ngeneral of the International<br />\nAssociation for Semiotic<br />\nStudies, the editor of VS and an<br />\neminent critic of James Joyce.<br />\nHis recent publications in<br />\nEnglish include A Theory of<br />\nSemiotics, and The Role of The<br />\nReader: Explorations in the<br />\nSemiotics of Texts. He is probably familiar to most<br />\nAmericans for his first novel,<br /><br />\nThe Name of the Rose, which<br />\nwas published in the United<br />\nStates in 1983, and subsequently became a bestseller.<br />\nProfessor Eco noted that<br />\nthere may have been a<br />\nmisunderstanding stemming<br />\nfrom the titling of his lecture.<br />\nHe stated that it had nothing to<br />\ndo with the concept of ancestry,<br />\nas the word 'roots' is often<br />\ntaken to mean, because of Alex<br />\nHaley's novel.<br />\nHis lecture was a treatment<br />\nof the classical dispute between<br />\nthe meaning intended to a piece<br />\nof writing and the meaning interpreted by the reader. These<br />\ntwo stances are, according to<br />\nEco, \"interpretive phanticism.\"<br />\nSaid Eco, \"The tracing of<br />\nthese two viewpoints to an intermediate position is done by<br />\nfollowing the intended meaning<br />\nforwards and the implicated<br />\nmeaning backwards.\" Added<br />\nEco,\"These poles and their interpretations, have influenced<br />\nmodern criticism.<br />\nThe intermediate position<br />\nwas broken down into two<br />\nterms: symbolism and allegory.<br />\n\"Symbolism is defined as<br />\nsomething that is representative,\" stated Eco. \"Sym-<br /><br />\nTutu Lecture Set For<br />\nJanuary at Hopkins<br />\nContinued Irom l'age I<br />\nin their love and hurl!anity,\"<br />\nexplained Watkins.<br />\nWhen Tutu accepted the invitation however, he expressed<br />\nconcern about possible attempts by the South African<br />\ngovernment to detain him.<br />\nTwice before, Tutu's passport<br />\nwas seized by the South African<br />\ngovernment and he has been<br />\nforced to travel with documents<br />\ndescribing his nationality as<br />\n\"undetermined\" for the past<br />\nfour years.<br /><br />\n\"If he doesn't come, we'd<br />\nconsider a number of other<br />\npeople,\" Watkins said.

Eco spoke on the topic 'Roots: Two Ideas of Interpretation' at the occasion of the G. Hart, Pouder Memorial Lecture.<br /><br />\nbolism, because of its nature, is<br />\npurposely imprecise, nebulous,<br />\nand unexploitable,\" added<br />\nEco. \"It is inadequate in expressing everything fully. Its<br />\nambiguity is brought to height<br />\nin the romantic sense and in<br />\nmathematics,\" continued Eco.<br />\n\"The word 'symbol' is denyed from the Greek, \"stated<br />\nEco. It originally referred to a<br />\npiece of something that recalled the whole. Eco said,\"An example is a ticket stub given at<br />\na theatre performance. All<br />\ncomprehend its meaning and<br />\nfunction as bestowing attendance.\"<br />\nIn discussing allegory, Eco<br />\nnoted, \"The classical sense of<br />\n'symbol' was quite synonymous<br />\nwith 'allegory.' They were both<br />\npart of the unknown, and so<br />\neach was used to explain God<br />\nand the writings of scripture.\"<br />\nScriptural interpretations<br />\ncenter around the Old and New<br />\nTestament. \"The Old Testament is the signifier,\" stated<br />\nEco,\"while the New Testament<br />\nis a letter of moral duties.\"<br />\n\"The Scriptures have the<br />\n3120 St. Paul<br />\nHAIR (e- 2.35.0741<br />\nUN LINII\"TEI)<br /><br />\nOPEN MONDAY<br />\n1 Till 6<br />\nTUES - SAT<br />\n10 Till 6<br /><br />\nHair Cutting -Henna -Frosting<br />\nPerms &amp; Body Waves<br />\nSpecial Children's Rates<br /><br />\nSTOP SWEAT<br />\nFOR 6 WEEKS<br /><br />\npotential to say everything, but<br />\nthey have been pored over by<br />\npersons looking for only one<br />\nthing,\" Eco continued. \"Every<br />\npossible meaning in the Scriptures is governed by a code in<br />\nthe allegorical sense. Its interpretation on the literal,<br />\nallegorical, moral, and mystical<br />\nmeanings.\"<br />\nThe Scriptures have been<br />\nlikened to an ocean or \"an infinite forest of senses,''<br />\ntranslated Eco from St.<br />\nJerome. Their truths are phrased many ways: \"same thing,<br />\nsame game, different ways,\"<br />\nremarked Eco.<br />\nEco also discussed the role of<br />\nSt. Augustine in determining<br />\nwhen to recognize a symbol. St.<br />\nAugustine's ruling on when a<br />\nfact is not literal but figurative<br />\nwas the first instance of modern<br />\ntextural interpretive theory.<br /><br />\nArthur S.

The committee has<br />\ndone its job, some will say, so the issue<br />\nis closed. Wrong. The issue is just now<br />\ncoming into its most critical moment.<br />\nThe administration needs to act\u2014<br />\nquickly\u2014on the report's worthwhile<br />\nrecommendations.<br />\nLet's first say the obvious: parts of the<br />\nreport are not only not worthwhile, they<br />\nare ridiculous. In particular, the report<br />\nadvocates the hiring of dozens of additional personnel. At a small university,<br />\nthat simply isn't possible; the money just<br />\nisn't there.<br />\nThe report says blithely, for example,<br />\nthat four new tenured faculty positions<br />\nought to be created specifically for<br />\nwomen. Leaving aside for the moment<br /><br />\nwhether or not that's a good idea, it's utterly unreasonable.<br />\nPerhaps the committtee members<br />\nthought that by asking for a mile they<br />\ncould bargain down to an inch. It's more<br />\nlikely people will disregard the report as<br />\nunrealistic rantings.<br />\nThat would be unfortunate, for there<br />\nis much in the report that makes a lot of<br />\nsense. In particular, we like the emphasis<br />\nplaced on increasing the number of<br />\nwomen on the faculty. Dean of the<br />\nSchool of Arts and Sciences George<br />\nFisher has said he and the other deans<br />\nwill appoint a committee to study the<br />\nreport's recommendations in that area.<br />\nBut why hasn't such a committee already<br />\nstarted working? Admittedly not much<br />\ncan be done in the summer, but the<br />\nacademic year is a month old. Fisher promises the committee in a few days. We'll<br />\nkeep an eye on him, but so should<br />\nstudents.<br />\nThe report's call for a day care center<br />\nalso deserves attention. Fisher says there<br />\nwill be \"conversations\" about the<br />\ncenter's establishment. He is indisputably honest, but that sounds like<br />\nfoot dragging. Recommendations on<br />\npublicizing the problems of sexual<br />\nharassment and improving educational<br />\nopportunities for employees are also<br />\nreasonable.<br />\nSo far, the administration has done<br />\nvirtually nothing to implement anything<br />\ncontained in the report. We'll grant that<br />\nit's early in the year, but visible progress<br />\nneeds to be made soon. At the same<br />\ntime, the committee should be chastised<br />\nfor having written a report which at<br />\ntimes is completely unrealistic. At this<br />\npoint, nobody has much to be proud of.<br /><br />\nA Day in the Park<br />\nRelations between Hopkins and the<br />\nsurrounding community have never been<br />\nexactly wonderful. After this summer's<br />\nbrouhaha over Wyman Park, they may<br />\nbe worse than ever.<br />\nIn short, the university asked permission to develop five acres of the park.<br />\nAdditional space is needed for research,<br />\nso the school planned to build two new<br />\noffice complexes. The mayor had apparently suggested the idea, but backed<br />\naway due to community uproar.<br />\nThe community claimed the university didn't really need the land, and argued<br />\nthe park is a valuable asset to the area.<br />\nThe matter is to be resolved this<br />\nmonth.<br />\nWhatever the outcome, it seems clear<br />\nthe university committed a public relations blunder.<br />\nPresumably the timing of the move\u2014<br />\nsmack in the middle of the summer\u2014<br />\nwas thought to be beneficial. Students<br />\nand faculty, the two university-connected<br />\ngroups most likely to sympathize with<br />\nthe community, would be out of touch<br />\nwith the school; many community<br />\nmembers would be on vacation. In<br /><br />\nretrospect, though, the timing could not<br />\nhave been worse. It looked as if the<br />\nuniversity was trying to sneak one by<br />\neverybody.<br />\nThen, in attempting to make matters<br />\nbetter, University President Steven<br />\nMuller may have made them worse. In<br />\na letter to The Sun (which is reprinted<br />\non the page opposite), he included a<br />\npreachy reference to the dictionary that<br />\ncould only have served to anger more<br />\npeople.<br />\nThe matter is a serious one because<br />\nHopkins has often had trouble with the<br />\nrest of Baltimore in the past. That isn't<br />\ntoo surprising\u2014Hopkins is clearly a bastion of upper-class privilege in a profoundly middle class area, and students<br />\nno doubt often come off as arrogant<br />\nsmart alecks. In that sense, no matter<br />\nwhat the university does, some members<br />\nof the community won't like it.<br />\nStill, there was no reason for Hopkins<br />\nto antagonize so many people with its<br />\nmove to take over the park. Handled<br />\ncorrectly, the expansion could have come<br />\noff smoothly.<br /><br />\nTwo weeks ago in an article a student-run station to a highon Brad Marks' Public Interest power professionally managed<br />\nInvestment Advisory Commit- operation took place with little<br />\ntee report to the Student Coun- consideration to student input.<br />\ncil, I wrote that Marks said he As far as I know, no one asked<br />\ndid not know much about a undergraduates if they wanted<br />\nresolution University President a third Homewood dean. ConMuller submitted to the cerning JHU's possible<br />\nTrustees concerning investment takeover of Wyman Park,<br />\nin South Africa. I quoted Brad students are invariably the last<br />\nto say: \"Muller sometimes to know what's going on.<br />\nBut then again, Hopkins adforgets to clear these things<br />\nthrough me.\" He made the ministrators cannot listen to<br />\nremark in jest, of course, and our concerns if we don't voice<br />\nit was in that spirit that I includ- them. The administration con-<br /><br />\nbill riesen<br />\ned it in the article. But underlying his lighthearted comment is<br />\na serious issue, one of the problems at Hopkins that troubles<br />\nme most.<br />\nMarks represents the<br />\nundergraduates to PIIAC, and<br />\nin that role he is our voice\u2014<br />\nour only voice\u2014 in the financial workings of the university.<br />\nThat the president's office has<br />\nleft him and the rest of PIIAC<br />\nin the dark about South<br />\nAfrican investment plans is<br />\ndisturbing. PIIAC submitted a<br />\nresolution of its own concerning divestment last spring, and<br />\nit is not clear whether Muller's<br />\nproposal mirrors it, falls short<br />\nof it, goes beyond it, or opposes<br />\nit completely. The message is<br />\nclear in any case: what students<br />\nhave to say does not matter in<br />\nhigh-level university decisions.<br />\nMuller's resolution is only<br />\none instance of when the<br />\npowers that be at Hopkins<br />\n\"sometimes forget to clear<br />\nthese things\" with the students.<br />\nThe conversion of WJHU from<br /><br />\nstantly<br />\nthat<br />\nstresses<br />\nundergraduate education is only a small (and apparently inconsequential) part of a university that also includes a hospital<br />\nand medical school, SAIS, the<br />\nApplied Physics Lab, and<br />\nresearch of all sorts. We cannot<br />\ntacitly accept this implication<br />\nthat undergraduates are unimportant at Johns Hopkins. Instead, we must make our views<br />\ncount\u2014after all, it's our<br />\nschool.<br />\nIf you care about investment<br />\nin South Africa or weapons<br />\nmanufacture, talk to Brad<br />\nMarks.

Political views are opinions on the formulation and<br />\nexecution of policies of a<br />\ngovernment, which are, it<br />\nseems to me, the primary concerns of a president of any<br />\ngovernmental body, and the<br />\nprincipal criteria for choosing<br />\none. Perhaps Kadri is simply<br />\nreferring to views on the politics<br />\nof the Federal government, but<br />\nthe resolution makes no mention of the policies of the<br />\nFederal government, only the<br />\nissue of apartheid. Since this<br />\nissue is obviously an important<br />\none to many Hopkins students,<br />\nand particularly if the Student<br />\nCouncil is going to take a stand<br />\non such an issue, it seems that<br />\na view on such an issue, and<br />\nopinions on forming policy<br />\nwith regards to the issue, would<br />\nbe important criteria for electing a student council president.<br />\nIn the same paragraph, he says,<br />\n\"But I will support whatever<br />\ndecides.\"<br />\ncouncil<br />\nthe<br />\nRegardless of his political<br />\nviews, the president of the Student Council should be a leader<br />\nof the council, not a follower.<br />\nSecondly, I was bothered by<br />\nthe idea of the resolution.<br />\nShowing a stand on the apartheid issue is one thing, but encouraging students to skip<br /><br />\nclasses is clearly an improper<br />\naction on the part of the Student Council. Additionally, the<br />\nterm \"boycotting classes\" gives<br />\nthe impression that the university is the party against the<br />\ngrievance exists in this case, just<br />\nas boycotting a merchant is an<br />\nindication of a grievance<br />\nagainst him, and a method of<br />\npressuring that merchant to<br />\nchange his policies. The university has already passed a resolution providing for at least a partial disinvestment of holdings<br />\nin South Africa, so a protest<br />\nagainst the university is inappropriate. Indeed, even were<br />\nsuch a protest in order, a<br />\nboycott of classes is a protest<br />\ncertain to do more harm to the<br />\nstudents than to the university.<br />\nA protester whose method of<br />\nprotest is to threaten harm to<br />\nhimself unless his demands are<br />\ngranted represents a very<br />\ntwisted morality, and is<br />\nhypocritical in that such a protest can only be effective<br />\nagainst a person who holds a<br />\nmore benevolent morality than<br />\nthe protester. I am paying tens<br />\nof thousands of dollars for my<br />\nHopkins education, and I do<br />\nnot intend to endanger any<br />\nparts of it in an irrational protest for the sake of people in<br />\nwhose interests I have no stake,<br />\nand who most certainly hold no<br />\nconcern for my interests.<br />\nSteve Jameson<br /><br />\nMuller: Wyman as<br />\nPart of Homewood<br />\nContinued from Page 9<br />\na public park is not a wilderness<br />\nbut an open public area with<br />\nplanned amenities. And total<br />\nwildness may be a refuge for<br />\nwild creatures one enjoys, but<br />\nalso for rats and for human<br />\nwildness.<br />\nOur need at Hopkins is to expand the Homewood campus,<br />\nboth to add to our academic<br />\nfacilities\u2014without overbuilding<br />\nour beautiful setting\u2014and to<br />\naccommodate one or two prized affiliated organizations, on<br />\nthe order of the Department of<br />\nEmbryology of the Carnegie Institution, which has been at<br />\nHomewood for two decades\u2014<br />\nand Space Telescope Science.<br />\nInstitute. Our own colleagues<br />\nand the staff of the new affiliates want and need to be on<br />\nthe campus\u2014near the Library,<br />\nthe Gym, the Hopkins Club,<br />\nand their colleagues.<br />\nBringing such new affiliated<br />\norganizations to a larger<br />\nHomewood campus is desirable<br />\nnot only for Hopkins but for<br />\nBaltimore\u2014not least because<br />\nnew job opportunities come<br />\nwith them. Our immediate<br />\nneighbors may already have<br />\nemployment, but other<br />\nBaltimoreans will benefit. And<br />\nwe may hope that it may no<br />\nlonger be necessary to make the<br />\ncase that Space Telescope<br />\nScience Institute is already one<br />\nof Baltimore's major new<br />\nassets\u2014and destined to become<br />\neven more so after Space<br />\nTelescope's launch into orbit<br />\nnext year.<br /><br />\nThe Sun has asked editorially what Hopkins might do in<br />\nreturn for the enlargement of<br />\nthe Homewood campus. A full<br />\nreply would be lengthy, but two<br />\nrecent actions can be quickly<br />\nnoted. We have just made some<br />\nof our land available to the<br />\nBaltimore Museum of Art to<br />\nhelp that neighbor accommodate both an addition to its<br />\noutdoor sculpture garden on<br />\none side and a more attractive<br />\nparking area on the other. And<br />\nHomewood House is in the<br />\nprocess of being restored and<br />\nrefurbished as a period house<br />\nand a major new public<br />\nattraction.<br />\nWe at Hopkins have as much<br />\nor more at stake in preserving<br />\nand enhancing the open<br />\nbeauties of Homewood as any<br />\nneighbor. Dire fears were expressed a few years ago when<br />\nwe first began construction on<br />\nthe western side of San Martin<br />\nDrive.<br />\nSome<br />\nof<br />\nour<br />\nneighbors\u2014and a then member<br />\nof the City Council\u2014<br />\nvigorously lobbied NASA not<br />\nto bring Space Telescope<br />\nScience<br />\nInstitute<br />\nto<br />\nHomewood. Those fears of<br />\nyesterday<br />\nhave<br />\nproven<br />\ngroundless. We are confident<br />\nthat the inclusion of Wyman<br />\nPark in the Homewood campus<br />\nwill prove to be an asset to our<br />\nneighbors and to the City. And<br />\nwe are committed to work with<br />\nthe community to develop the<br />\npark\u2014as<br />\npart<br />\nof<br />\nHomewood\u2014in ways that all<br />\nof us would find most<br />\nattractive.<br /><br />\nContinued from Page 9<br />\nters of protest, and suddenly<br />\nconfronted with a city-wide<br />\ncoalition of Communities<br />\nUnited to Save Wyman Park,<br />\nconceded that no action would<br />\nbe taken before October 1st.<br />\nThe subsequent debate pitted<br />\npopular pro-park sentiment<br />\nfrom all corners of the city<br />\nagainst powerful elements of<br />\nBalitmore's power structure.<br />\nThe Mayor, beholden to one<br />\nfor financial support and to the<br />\nothers for votes was caught in<br />\nthe middle. Three main issues<br />\ndivide the contestants: the need<br />\nfor space, the park as a managed amenity, and how decisions<br />\nabout the park are to be<br />\nreached.<br />\nParks belong to the people<br />\nand should ever remain that<br />\nway. The sacrifice of park<br />\nspace to any particular interest,<br />\nif it is to be contemplated at all,<br />\nshould be a very last resort. So<br />\nsay many of the concerned<br />\ncitizens of Baltimore.<br />\nThe University, on the other<br />\nhand, claims it needs space to<br />\nexpand and accomodate affiliated institutions. None of<br />\nthe community people I know<br />\nquestions the right of the<br />\nUniversity to expand although<br />\nthere are many faculty who<br />\nworry that we are straying too<br />\nfar from the conception of a<br />\nuniversity and too close to a<br />\nmultinational R &amp; D corporation for our own comfort. Be<br />\nthat as it may, the University's<br />\ndemand for public space poses<br />\ntwo immediate questions:<br />\n\u2022 Is there a way to find that<br />\nspace within the confines of the<br />\nexisting campus? The answer is<br />\nobviously \"yes\" though not<br />\nwithout some sacrifice of<br />\nperhaps<br />\nand<br />\namenities<br />\naesthetics. Is it reasonable to<br />\nforce others to sacrifice their<br /><br />\namenities and aesthetics in<br />\norder to preserve our own?<br />\n\u2022 The University says it will<br />\ndevelop only five acres of the<br />\npark. Why then does it seek<br />\ncontrol over all thirty-five<br />\nacres? The suspicion lurks and<br />\nhistory teaches that more is at<br />\nstake than just those five acres.<br />\nOnce in control, the university<br />\nwill probably be as high-handed<br />\nin its decisions on the western<br />\nside of the park as it has been<br />\non the eastern side. And the<br />\ndecisions are often questionable. The present plan for<br />\nthe park is a case in point.<br />\nBuilding complexes at both the<br />\nsouth and north end of the park<br />\n(the latter armed with a 600 car<br />\nparking facility) are to be connected by a road that runs the<br />\nlength of the ravine and straddles the stream. That turns the<br />\npark into a parkway, does not<br />\na little environmental damage,<br />\nincrease noise and pollution,<br />\nand reduces the aesthetic value<br />\nof the stream and ravine to<br />\nnothing.<br />\nThe university claims it<br />\nwishes to develop the park as a<br />\n\"partly public\" facility integrated into the Homewood<br />\nCampus. Community people<br />\nare skeptical of that on a<br />\nnumber of grounds.<br />\nThe management of the part<br />\nof the park Hopkins does control is poor. Just look at the old<br />\ndesks and chairs tipped down<br />\ninto the ravine by the playing<br />\nfield, the filthy run-off (containing who knows what toxics)<br />\ninto Stony Run and the total<br />\nneglect of the Wyman Spring<br />\nand path. And there has been<br />\na significant loss of tree cover<br />\nunder university management.<br />\nWill the university truly be willing to commit scarce financial<br />\nresources (tuition monies?) to<br />\nthe maintenance of fitness and<br />\nhiking trails, the kid's play area<br /><br />\nat 34th and Beech, all open to<br />\nthe public?<br />\nClaims that university control will improve security in the<br />\npark likewise fall on deaf ears.<br />\nThere is far more crime on<br />\ncampus than there is in<br />\nWyman Park. Just look at the<br />\ndata. And the cost of ensuring<br />\nsecurity across that sprawled<br />\nbe<br />\nwill<br />\npark<br />\ncampus<br />\nastronomical.<br />\nThe \"partly public\" claim<br />\nalso has a strange ring to it.<br />\nWhile it is true that some outside groups and individual use<br />\ncampus facilities now, the use<br />\nis rather tightly controlled.<br />\nPresident Muller wants to see<br />\nthe park developed as an \"urban\" park rather than as a<br />\ncurious piece of wilderness in<br />\nthe city. He is entitles to his opinion but then so are those who<br />\nlike the park the way it is. How<br />\nare conflicts of that sort to be<br />\naired?<br />\nThe President now claims he<br />\nwants to work with the community to improve the park for<br />\nall. The community again has<br />\nreason to be skeptical. Experience teaches that the university never consults the community about major decisions<br />\n(the building of Olin Hall, the<br />\nSpace Telescope, the playing<br />\nfield, all on the university side<br />\nof the park). And why that sudden land-grab in the height of<br />\nsummer?<br />\nRobert Bowie, vice-president<br />\nin charge of financial affairs<br />\nwas plain enough about that.<br />\n\"I'm not really interested in<br />\nhaving the community tell us<br />\nwhat our alternatives are,\" he<br />\ntold The Sun, \"any more than<br />\nthey are interested in us telling<br />\nthem where to live.\"<br />\nStatements like that only fuel<br />\nan opposition that strongly<br />\nbelieves public space is a vital<br />\nand sacrosanct public resource.<br /><br />\nCHICA,G0 PIZZERIA,<br />\n5914 York Road<br />\n433-0114<br /><br />\nSAVE 25C ON<br />\nOUR BUFFET!<br /><br />\n15 W Penna.

/><br />\n14/OCTOBER 4, 1985<br /><br />\nArts<br />\nTears For Fears: It's a Civic Center World<br />\nby Sue Trowbridge<br />\nI seldom venture into arenas.<br />\nBut the prospect of Tears for<br />\nFears playing a mere thirty-five<br />\nblocks from my home was hard<br />\nto resist. After all, I had liked<br />\nthem back in the days when<br />\nthey probably couldn't have<br />\nfilled Shriver Hall, much less<br />\nthe Civic Center; I really<br />\nwanted to go see them, and I<br />\nwasn't going to let ten thousand<br />\n15-year-olds with paisley jeans<br />\nand perfectly moussed hair deter<br />\nme.<br />\nOn the bus to the concert, I<br />\nsuddenly realized that I had<br />\nforgotten to bring my good old<br />\nFlents earplugs. This was a major mistake. Many hours after<br />\nthe show, I'm still a bit deaf in<br />\nmy left ear, the one that was<br />\nfacing the wall of speakers on<br />\nthe stage.<br />\nArriving at the Civic Center,<br />\nI surveyed the crowd. Although<br />\nit was predominantly young<br />\nand female, there were also<br />\nbiker types with tatoos, lots of<br />\ncollege-aged people, even someone wearing a jacket with<br />\nthe logo of D.C. hardcore band<br />\nMinor Threat on the back.<br />\nMost of them were still<br />\nroaming the corridors when the<br />\nopening band, The Adventures,<br />\ncame on at 7:35 p.m. In the<br />\ngrand tradition of warmup<br /><br />\nTears For Fears: The Guys\u2014The Haircuts<br /><br />\nacts, they were overwhelmingly mediocre, pumping out<br />\nunoriginal pop-rock tunes for a<br />\nmercifully short half hour. Of<br />\ncourse, they also had the<br />\nobligatory female backup<br />\nvocalist in tight pants banging<br />\non a tamborine.<br />\nIt took about 45 minutes for<br />\nTears For Fears to take the<br />\nstage. As I waited, I decided<br />\nthat being at a concert with lots<br />\nof young teens had its<br />\nadvantages\u2014there was hardly<br />\nany smoke in the air, cigarette<br />\nor otherwise.<br />\n' But, when the lights went<br /><br />\ndown, I realized that life is indeed full of little tradeoffs.<br />\nSeated right behind me were<br />\nhalf a dozen girls who were apparently finalists in the<br />\nPillsbury Scream-Off.<br />\nTears For Fears kicked their<br />\nset with a lukewarm version of<br />\n\"Mothers Talk,\" but things<br />\npicked up when they launched<br />\ninto their current single,\" Head<br />\nOver Heels,\" which has got to<br />\nbe the most gorgeous song to<br />\nhit the pop charts in ages.<br />\nSinger Roland Orzabal's voice<br />\nsounded wonderful here, soaring easily into a falsetto. Listen-<br /><br />\ning to Orzabal sing may have<br />\nbeen a pure pleasure, but unfortunately, his between-song<br />\npatter was like something out<br />\nof a bad Las Vegas revue\u2014<br />\n\"God bless you and your<br />\nchildren, and your children's<br />\nchildren,\" etc.<br />\nOf course, not all of Tears<br />\nFor Fears' songs are as good as<br />\n\"Head Over Heels\" or \"Pale<br />\nShelter,\" their third number.<br />\nThere were a couple of slow<br />\nand boring ones in the middle.<br />\nDuring the plodding \"Start<br />\nof the Breakdown,\" I amused<br />\nmyself by watching the drama<br />\nof a girl near the stage who<br />\nthrew a large hoop earring at<br />\nCurt Smith, Tears For Fears<br />\nother lead singer. She was promptly accosted by a brawny<br />\nsecurity guard who began to<br />\nlead her away, but she must<br />\nhave pleat-bargained, since she<br />\nmanaged to stay put.<br />\nAmong the show's highlights<br />\nwas \"The Working Hour,\"<br />\nanother beauty from Songs<br />\nFrom The Chair, their current<br />\nLP. Their saxophonist was put<br />\nto particularly good use here,<br />\ncontributing an elegant solo.<br />\nThey also did an excellent<br />\nversion of their big hit<br />\n\"Shout,\" which finished off<br />\nwith all seven members of the<br />\nband at the front of the stage,<br />\nchanting the mindless but cat-<br /><br />\nchy lyrics to the accompaniment of a drum machine.<br />\nAll in all, each of the eight<br />\nsongs on Songs From The Big<br />\nChair were played (although<br />\nthe version of \"Listen\" was<br />\npurely an instrumental interlude before the curtain went<br />\nup). But they also did many of<br />\ntheir early tracks from The<br />\nHurting, which rivals Joy Division for stark depressing lyrics.<br />\nI never thought I'd see thousand of jubilant, Bic-flicking<br />\nteens swaying along to rhymes<br />\nlike Mad World's \"I find it<br />\nkind of funny, I find it kind of<br />\nsad/The dreams in which I'm<br />\ndying are the best I ever had.\"<br />\nOther pluses\u2014the lighting<br />\nwas incredible, and the drummer provided a mighty beat.<br />\nThe sound, in fact, was better<br />\nthan I can ever remember hearing at any arena show, instead<br />\nof the muddy mess that often<br />\nresults in such cavernous<br />\nvenues.<br />\nBut then again, my last arena<br />\nshow was two and a half years<br />\nago.

Whiting School of<br />\nEngineering. This program<br />\nconsisted of renovation of<br />\nMaryland Hall and Latrobe<br />\nHall and the construction of a<br />\n10,000-square-foot addition to<br />\nLatrobe Hall. Both Maryland<br />\nand Latrobe Halls, built with a<br />\n$600,000 grant made by the<br />\nState of Maryland in 1912, are<br />\namong the oldest academic<br />\nbuildings on the Homewood<br />\ncampus.<br />\nThe renovation work that<br />\nwas done in Maryland Hall was<br />\ncentered on rebuilding the rear<br />\nwing of Maryland that was<br />\nknown as Machinery Hall.<br />\nMachinery Hall was itself a<br />\ntwo-story addition that provided lab space for professors who<br />\nrequired a large open area.<br />\nOver the years experiments of<br />\nall types had taken place in<br />\nMachinery Hall and slowly<br />\nthese experiments also took<br />\ntheir toll on the structure.<br />\nEverything from a large mass<br />\nof 18-inch thick concrete radio<br />\nfrequency shielding, to a wind<br />\ntunnel, to large pieces of<br />\nmachinery, and even a ceiling<br />\ncrane, had found itself in the<br />\nhall. With the 1977 deicision to<br />\nre-establish the School of<br />\nEngineering at Hopkins came<br />\nthe commitment to re-equip<br />\nthis new school. This commitment came to an early fruition<br />\nin the decision to renovate<br />\nMaryland Machinery Hall.<br />\nThe commitment, to return<br />\nengineering at Hopkins to its<br />\nearlier level of excellence, was<br />\naccompanied by the need to re-<br /><br />\nestablish two new departments,<br />\nCivil<br />\nEngineering<br />\nand<br />\nMechanical Engineering. The<br />\ncreation of these two departments, it was recognized, would<br />\ncreate a great need for additional lab and classroom space.<br />\nFortunately for the Whiting<br />\nSchool, just at the time that it<br />\nwas growing, the University<br />\nreceived a gift to build Olin<br />\nHall for the Department of<br />\nEarth and Planetary Sciences.<br />\nWith this department no longer<br />\nin Latrobe Hall, the Whiting<br />\nSchool had substantially more<br />\nspace. The long term use of<br />\nLatrobe Hall, however, required a major renovation of<br />\nthe entire structure. The need<br />\nfor even more space for<br />\nengineering was becoming apparent. Thus, when Dean V.<br />\nDavid VandeLinde developed<br />\nthe idea that the earth depression behind Latrobe Hall be<br />\nfilled in with an underground<br />\nlab wing the suggestion was<br />\ntaken seriously.<br />\nOne may wonder what were<br />\nsome of the events that created<br />\nthis need for more space. On<br />\nthe most fundamental level, it<br />\nwas a growth in the number of<br />\npeople<br />\nassociated<br />\nwith<br />\nengineering at Hopkins. In<br />\n1978, there were 363<br />\nundergraduates majoring in<br />\nengineering and 138 engineering<br />\ngraduate students. The 1983-84<br />\nschool<br />\nyear<br />\nsaw<br />\n597<br />\nundergraduates and 235<br />\ngraduate students in the fulltime program. Enrollment in<br />\nthe part-time engineering program saw the number of<br />\nmasters degree candidates double from the 1978 school year<br />\nto the present with more than<br />\n1,500 people now in the program. The number of faculty<br />\nmembers has grown by more<br />\nthan 30 since 1979. Each of<br />\nthese students, faculty, and<br />\nstaff just simply required more<br /><br />\nMichael Runge<br /><br />\nThe new wing of Latrobe Hall, which houses underground laboratory space.<br /><br />\nroom!

I'm always seeing<br />\nimprovement.\" The coach feels<br />\nthat right now, Hopkins is<br /><br />\nalready on a par with all the<br />\nlocal colleges such as Notre<br />\nDame and Goucher. \"We<br />\nusually play up to or down to<br />\nthe level of the other team.\"<br />\nLeading this year's squad is<br />\nIlga Celmins, the team's lone<br />\nsenior. She's listed as a setter,<br />\nbut in actuality she serves as<br />\nboth a setter and a hitter.<br />\n\"Everything Ilga does, she does<br />\nwell,\" said Finnessy.<br />\nCelmins is joined in the starting lineup by juniors Debbi<br />\nOlson and Susie Stickney,<br />\nsophomore Ashi Rafi, and<br />\nFrosh Ayesha Rook, Allison<br />\nUnger, and Jacki Mazarella.<br />\nAccording to Finnessy, \"Debbie, Susie, and Ashi have all<br />\nprogressed a great deal. They've<br />\nshown a Wimprovement each<br /><br />\nyear.\"<br />\nAs for the freshmen, Rook is<br />\na hitter that has shown great<br />\nimprovement already. With<br />\nmore game experience, she<br />\nshould advance even more.<br />\nUnger and Mazarella are both<br />\nsetters that carry much potential for the future. Finnessy<br />\ncites both for their outstanding<br />\ntransitional play.<br />\nThe spikers are rounded out<br />\nby junior alternates Karen<br />\nKawanoto, Helen Kim, Deena<br />\nKjeldsen and Esther Wagner.<br />\nAll are hitters and \"they're all<br />\ntough defensively and they get<br />\ngood passes off.\"<br />\nWhat does the future hold<br />\nfor the women's volleyball<br />\nteam? This years schedule includes eleven matches plus a<br />\ntournament at Gallaudet at the<br />\nend of the season. The lone<br />\nhome games are on October 16<br />\nwhen Hopkins will face Sheppard at 6:00 p.m. and then<br />\nCatholic at 8:00 p.m. Next<br />\nyear, Finnessy plans a bigger<br />\nschedule, with a mixture and<br />\nstrong and weak teams.<br /><br />\nSusan Shiber<br /><br />\nThe Hooters make final preparations for big games against Ursinus and<br />\nUMBC in the upcoming week.<br /><br />\nHocksters Tie Juniata<br />\nby Laura Perlinn<br />\nOn September 28, the<br />\nwomen's field hockey team<br />\nbattled MAC rival Juniata College, beating them in every<br />\ncategory but the final score.<br />\nThe Jays had more shots on<br />\ngoal, free hits, and penalty corners, but after two 10-minute<br />\novertime periods, the game<br />\nended in a 1-1 tie.<br />\nJuniata got on the board first<br />\nwith a goal midway through the<br />\nfirst half, after a skirmish in<br />\nfront of the goal from right<br />\nwing April Savoye.<br />\n\"We played a great game in<br />\nthe middle of the field,\" said<br />\nCoach Sally Beth Anderson,<br />\n\"but once we got into scoring<br /><br />\nTHE WEEK IN SPORTS<br />\nSaturday, October 5<br />\nFootball vs. Gettysburg<br />\nSoccer vs. Ursinus<br />\nField Hockey vs. Mt.
