The management says that<br />\nthe men get as much as they want<br />\nof first class quality food.<br />\nFor the midday meal, the diners, chiefly young instructors,<br />\nusually have a roast, two vegetables, and dessert. These are supplemented very often, though, by<br />\nother delicacies left over from the<br />\nday before. This is particularly<br />\ntrue of desserts. Occasionally a<br />\nfew extra pies will be baked, put<br />\ninto the pantry, and added to the<br />\nfollowing day's menu. Then some<br />\nsharp-eyed<br />\nprofessor, passing<br />\nthrough the pantry, will spy the<br />\npie and make short work of it.<br />\nDesserts, 'however, are not the<br />\nonly food from which the profs<br />\ncan choose. The chef knows the<br />\nfancies and peculiarities of each<br />\nman's diet, and tries to give everyone just what he wants. For instance, one man may not like<br />\nroasts. Something else will then<br />\nbe provided for him\u2014cold meats.<br />\nor possibly a canned vegetable.<br />\nThere is always something on<br />\nhand to fall back on.

In addition to these,<br />\ntwelve to fifteen usually eat breakfast and dinner there. More men<br />\ntake their lunch at the Club, however, than any other meal. The<br />\nreason for this, of course, is that<br />\nmany of the diners have their own<br />\nhomes in other parts of the city,<br />\nand consequently have breakfast<br />\nand dinner with their families.<br />\nWednesday is the biggest day ot<br />\nthe week, when over forty eat at<br />\nthe club.

The management says that<br />\nthe men get as much as they want<br />\nof first class quality food.<br />\nFor the midday meal, the diners, chiefly young instructors,<br />\nusually have a roast, two vegetables, and dessert. These are supplemented very often, though, by<br />\nother delicacies left over from the<br />\nday before. This is particularly<br />\ntrue of desserts. Occasionally a<br />\nfew extra pies will be baked, put<br />\ninto the pantry, and added to the<br />\nfollowing day's menu. Then some<br />\nsharp-eyed<br />\nprofessor, passing<br />\nthrough the pantry, will spy the<br />\npie and make short work of it.<br />\nDesserts, 'however, are not the<br />\nonly food from which the profs<br />\ncan choose.

In addition to these,<br />\ntwelve to fifteen usually eat breakfast and dinner there. More men<br />\ntake their lunch at the Club, however, than any other meal. The<br />\nreason for this, of course, is that<br />\nmany of the diners have their own<br />\nhomes in other parts of the city,<br />\nand consequently have breakfast<br />\nand dinner with their families.<br />\nWednesday is the biggest day ot<br />\nthe week, when over forty eat at<br />\nthe club.
