This \u2022<br />\nreferendum is not to be taken lightly. Too many<br />\ntimes in 'the past has the Council succeeded in<br />\nramrodding the students. Indeed, we urge that<br />\neveryone slog their way through the Constitution<br />\nas it is presented in today's issue and decide, with<br />\nsome ch ought, the relative merits of this<br />\ndocument. After giving the proposal much<br />\nconsideration, the News-Letter has no qualms in<br />\nurging a \"No\" vote.<br />\nTo go through the constituion clause by clause would take up too much .space and time.<br />\nHowever, there are several major points which are<br />\nindicative of the Constitution's shortcomings..<br />\nThe proposed Constitution is filled with -bad<br />\nwriting, murky definitions, useless verbiage and<br />\nvapid content. Supposedly the Council has been<br />\nworking since the beginning of the school year on<br />\nthe proposal. The effort is not readily apparent.<br />\nIn the first articles we are presented with a<br />\npicture of the Imperial Council. \"The Student<br />\nCouncil and its designates are the sole<br />\nrepresentatives of the Students.\" Are the<br />\nstudents incapable of representing themselves by<br />\nother means? To answer this question in the<br />\naffirmative (as the Council seemingly has). is<br />\nabsurd. The students are very capable of acting<br />\nand speaking for themselves. The students have a<br />\ngolden opportunity to prove this by voting \"No\"<br />\nnext week.<br />\nThe exclusiveness of the Imperial Council<br />\npermeates Article II. \"Any Student who shows<br />\nsincere interest and ability ill working with the<br />\n<br />\nStudent Council, may work on a Student council<br />\ncommittee.\" Exactly how is a \"sincere interest<br />\nand ability\" evaluated? More often than not, it is<br />\nevaluated by the closeness of the personal<br />\nrelationship between the chooser and chosen. It<br />\nis hardly believable that the Council would be so<br />\nblatantly political in a proposal presented to the<br />\nentire student body. Maybe it is just another<br />\nindication of the Council's low esteem of the<br />\nstudents.<br />\nA deluded omnipotence is the main feature of<br />\nArticle III. \"A. Inquire, speak, and act on behalf<br />\nof the Students. B. Coordinate and implement a<br />\nvaried and invigorating social calendar.\" It is<br />\ngetting almost comical now to read the COuncil's<br />\ncondescension towards the students. Now we<br />\ndiscover one of their main goals is to keep us<br />\n\"invigorated\" with an exciting menu of social<br />\nevents. Whoopee. This must be overwhelmingly<br />\nimportant to the Council because in Article IV,<br />\nthe executive position of Social Director is<br />\ncreated, a position before known only in summer<br />\ncamps and resort hotels. The image of two<br />\nthousand Hopkins students standing in the lower<br />\nquad playing \"Simon Says\" comes easily to<br />\nmind. Needless to say, the idea of a campus-wide<br />\nvote on a Social Director is ridiculous. We would<br />\nmuch rather prefer the simple and logicil<br />\nprocedure of letting the Selections Committee<br />\nappoint a Social Committee chairman. The vision<br />\nof a student being elected Social Director on his<br />\npromise of more beer nights in the Rat is<br />\ncertainly horrifying.<br />\nHidden in the back of the Constitution is<br />\nArticle VII which deals with impeachment.<br />\nTwenty per cent of the students (approximately<br />\n<br />\n400 people, the size of a large Chemistry class)<br />\nare needed to sign an impeachment petition.<br />\nBefore this petition can be acted upon by a<br />\nstudent referendum, the cause for impeachment<br />\nmust be verified by the student members of the<br />\nAcademic Ethics Board. Nowhere in. this<br />\nConstitution can one find any definition of the<br />\ngrounds for impeachment. Apparently, the valid<br />\nreasons are a secret known only to the Academic<br />\nEthics Board. The student members of the board<br />\n(numbering no more than ten) can squelch the<br />\nvoice of 400 students. Surely if one wanted to<br />\navoid impeachment, this is the easiest way to go<br />\nabout it.<br />\nThe Council has seemingly never heard of tile<br />\nSunshine Laws being passed in almost every state.<br />\nIn Article VIII, the Council proposes a complex<br />\nset of rules to establish and regulate closed<br />\nsessions. We find it mighty hard to conceive of a<br />\nset of circumstances that would necessitate a<br />\nclosed session. Perhaps a clandestine meeting to.<br />\ndiscuss ways of buffaloing this Constituion<br />\nthrough the Students would be a possibility.<br />\nWe won't even bother to mention the tangled<br />\nweb of bureaucratic doubletalk concerning SAC<br />\ngroups. This was the part of the old Constitution<br />\nthat needed the most revision but of course not<br />\neven the slightest change was made. There is little<br />\nrecommend in this new Constitution. Perhaps the<br />\nonly re-deeming feature of this \"document\" is<br />\nthat it presents proof of. the Council's<br />\nineffectiveness and ineptitude in ascertaining its<br />\nown role. Perhaps their motive is to keep us as<br />\nuninformed as themselves.<br />\n<br />\nletters to the editor<br />\nT o the Editor:<br />\nRe: Corrections to the article I<br />\nof February 17, 1978, Volume<br />\nLXXII, Number XVIII, pages 1<br />\nand 2, \"Residents protest Charles<br />\nSecurity, Heat Conditions\", by<br />\nDan Wile.<br />\nSeveral errors occurred in the<br />\nprinting of that article.

I recall<br />\none incident in particular which illustrates this<br />\nphenomenon perfectly: Dixie Dick and I had cornered<br />\ntwo busty beauties in the corner of a crowded Tephousc<br />\nanteroom, and were avidly trying to assess their\u2022<br />\nwillingness towards accepting a ride back to their<br />\nrespective campuses. The one next to me innocently<br />\nblurts out--\"lt must be very exciting being a writer.\"--and<br />\nbefore I could work up a lecherous grin I feel the weight<br />\nof Dixie Dick's arm around my shoulder and hear a tiny<br />\nthud as his car keys clandestinely drop into my coat<br />\npocket. Not to be outdone, the one next to Dixie turns<br />\nup her devastating baby browns and coos--\"You look<br />\nasthough you work out a lot.\" It hurts, but I can't deny<br />\nthe facts. Finding a quick jocular excuse to fling my arm<br />\naround Dixie Dick's shoulders, I reluctantly redeposit the<br />\nkeys in his jacket.<br />\nAs if on cue, my chesty cherub now bubbles--\"I'm so<br />\ntired of this party. I wish I could wrangle a ride home<br />\nfrom somebody nice.\" Again the arm falling across my<br />\ncollarbone and my roommate's deep-thtoated laugh cover<br />\nthe keys' jangle,as they fall into place against my hip. For<br />\na moment it looks like close cooperation has carried the<br />\nday once .again. For a second it seems as though selfless<br />\nsacrifice will make yet another grab at the golden ring<br />\npossible for this lonely scribe. Unfortunately, all the<br />\npawing Dixie Dick ..;ind I have been doing at each other<br />\nduring the course of this complicated operation has<br />\nthoroughly - convinced the - two girls that we are<br />\nhomosexuals of the first water--they quickly excuse<br />\nthemselves amid stilled giggles and walk away in disgust..<br />\n<br />\nBy tar the most exciting aspect of frat life is that<br />\ninterval between Rush Week and the first flowering of<br />\nSpring, when, all over campus, the new pledges do battle<br />\nwith their brothers-to-be. Many people are disgusted by<br />\nthese \u2022 annual antics, labeling them as \"juvenile\" or<br />\n\"class,\" but I see them as nothing more sinister than<br />\nharmless entertainment for the student body. I think it<br />\nadds a touch of drama to the mundane collegiate grind to<br />\nsee groups of marauders sneaking about, whip cream in<br />\nhand, waiting to savagely pounce on an unsuspecting<br />\nvictim.<br />\n.1 remember my freshman year, when quite a few of my<br />\nfriends were sleeping with one eye open and never turning<br />\ntheir goose-pimply backs to open doorways. There was<br />\none .chap at the end of our hall who, by using his<br />\nformidable wits, had somehow miraculously avoided<br />\nchastisement of any kind all spring. But the word was<br />\nout--he was a hunted man. Determined not to succumb,<br />\nhe locked himself in his room and struck a deal with me. I<br />\nwas to slip beef jerky under the door three times a day<br />\nand supply him with adequate fresh water. The latter<br />\nwas accomplished by placing a small bucket in front of the<br />\n\u2022door and slipping a long, plastic tube into the room which<br />\nhe could suck like a straw. In this way he hoped to spend<br />\nthe weekend in complete safety until the official end of<br />\nhostilities on Monday morning. (Oh, yes, he also<br />\nconsumed mass quantities of Kaopectate in order to<br />\nkeen'bodily wastes at a minimum.) Ilis brothers tried time<br />\nand time again to lure him out, but since he would<br />\nrespond only to my voice, their efforts were in vain.<br />\nThen, Sunday night, they came to me with a<br />\nproposition of their own. If! would sell my pal, they said,<br />\nI would be the proud owner of a bottle of Gin. Naturally,<br />\nI was indignant. Being a man of honor and high moral<br />\nprinciples, I informed them that I could be had for<br />\nnothing less than a bottle of Chevas. This they happily<br />\nproduced. So, while I told my captive chum to prepare<br />\nfor what he thought was a cool drink, the fratman quietly<br />\nconnected the end of the tube to a small glass of Tobasco<br />\nsauce. I must admit, I felt a twinge of guilt when I heard<br />\nthe scream of animal pain which erupted from behind the<br />\nlocked door. What followed was a loud choking that<br />\nsounded like someone was drowning cats, and then a long<br />\n-cry of\"Waaatcer!! Waaaater!!!\"<br />\n\"Come on out, pledge,\" taunted the fratmen, \"we've<br />\ngot water!!\"<br />\nIndeed they did--two trash cans full. And mixed in with<br />\nit were some of the vilest liquids it's ever been<br />\nmymisfortune to smell. Needless to say, my even more<br />\nunfortunate friend wound up wearing it. Funniest damn<br />\nthing I ever did see.<br />\n<br />\nLOST INNOCENCE<br />\n<br />\nMiss Fill and the lucky winner.<br />\n\"Down in front!\" shrieked the drunk pre-nled,<br />\nwishing to instigate a nasty ruckus I moved to or<br />\nbut still the bespectacled and besmirched nerd scl<br />\n\"Down in front! Goddamnit! Down in front!\"<br />\nAt that moment I realized his wino whines<br />\nmeant for my ears, but for the rather lubricio'<br />\nvisible talents of Miss Fifi, the slatternly strippef '<br />\nto entice innocent freshmen like myself into<br />\nof iniquity. My head w:s lost in the head of the tlat<br />\ncontinually flushed down my throat. Was I e<br />\npledge? Would they accept me if I did?

Of course there was no Rat back<br />\nthen, so the houses really had,a monopoly on getting<br />\npeople wasted, but there was more to it then that--much<br />\nmore. I remember one fella in particular, by the name of<br />\nJoJo Samples, who really lived for 'em, know what I<br />\nmean? Now JoJo was about six-three and two-thirty at<br />\nleast, and he'd put the brew away a quart at a time<br />\nwithout stopping for air. Never had to hit the can<br />\neither--it just disappeared down his throat and wasn't ever<br />\nheard from again. All the brothers were petrified<br />\nWhenever JoJo stepped through their door, because they<br />\nknew damn well before he left someone or something<br />\nwould get busted up pretty good. J recall one night when<br />\nthere was an altercation at Sig Ep, and for reasons. that<br />\nnever became clear, JoJo got pushed out the third story<br />\nwindow and landed on his head. Needless to say, a crowd<br />\nquickly gathered around him on the lawn. A passing<br />\npatrolman walked up and asked, \"What happened, son?\"<br />\n\"I don't know,\" said JoJo, \"I just got here myself.\"<br />\nNot long on brains, ole JoJo, but one hell of a partyer.<br />\n\"Then there was the time he was refused service at a<br />\nfrat when it became clear that he . was intoxicated far<br />\nbeyond the point of no return. Upon hearing the refusal,<br />\nhe leveled a stare at the barkeep that would have made<br />\nSatan himself soil his drawers, and silently marched out<br />\nthe door. All those involved breathed a sigh of relief<br />\nbut their peace of mind was destined to be short-lived.<br />\nJoJo returned barely half an hour later brandishing a .006<br />\nshotgun and a six-inch Bowie knife. \u2022 He proceeded<br />\nunmolested to the bar, leveled his weapon at the petrified<br />\npledge behind it, and snai led, \"Start pourin', pissant!\" He<br />\nhad\" finished six glasses in quick succession and was<br />\nworking on his seventh when he suddenly pitched<br />\nbackwards and collapsed into a fermenting heap on the<br />\nfloor. The -scatter- gun was later found to be empty and<br />\nthe knife nothing but a rubber imitation, but, in the<br />\nfuture, all JoJo's requests for ,liquid refreshment were<br />\nanswered as proMptly, and courteously, as was humanly<br />\nPossible.<br />\n\"Nosir,\" says the cap'n, returning from his nostalgic<br />\nteverie, \"they just don't make 'em like ole JoJo Samples<br />\nanymore.

Drifting in the foggy nether-world twixt<br />\nalcoholic stupor and bedwetting sleep, a distant, rhythmic<br />\nchanting came wafting in from the hall. \"Some asshole<br />\npracticing his mantra,\" I mumbled, and, opening the<br />\ndoor, prepared to give the miscreant a rather derogatory<br />\nassessment of Eastern religions. I was ill prepared forwhat<br />\nI saw.. Coming down the hallway were six figures<br />\ncompletely covered with heavy -purple cloaks, which<br />\ndraggedalong behind them on the floor! One of these<br />\nghostly apparitions carried an incense burner in one hand<br />\nand an ornate sceptre in the other. A thousand panicky<br />\nthoughts darted through my eighty-proof brain:<br />\nThe Ku Klux Klan!<br />\nThe Mansons!<br />\nCrazed Dominicans!!!<br />\nMercifully, the eerie crew passed by without even a<br />\nsideways glance, and filed silently into the room next<br />\ndoor. Ear pressed to the cinderblock, I listened as the<br />\ninterrogation began.<br />\n\"Pledge!! Do you love your<br />\nbrothers?\"<br />\n'Ye-ye-yes.\" came the halting reply.<br />\n\"Would you do anything for your brothers?\"<br />\n'Ye-yes.

I've seen pre-meds go crazy in Hutzler, a<br />\nsudden geyser of notes and books, a resounding,\"Fuck it<br />\nall!\" I've seen nitwits fry theirl brains in too much acid<br />\nand prance about campus do-dahing Pink Floyd songs<br />\nand in the middle of May innocently ask, \"Why didn't<br />\nyou tell me there were final exams?\" Well, I'd thought I'd<br />\nseen it all, until one 'rush party at Sig Ep (you would<br />\nfigure it out anyway) just a few weeks ago. It sort of<br />\nshakes up an old man's day for something unpredictable<br />\nto happen.<br />\nI was feeling quite mellow, as is my wont on Friday<br />\nnight after a tough week of classes. My tongue was<br />\nloosened by several shots of cheap whiskey and thusly<br />\nbecame the lucid instrument of witty execution one<br />\nwould expect of Jerry Lewis at a debutante ball. \"What<br />\ndo you expect when you mix gin and milk of magnesia?\"<br />\n\"A Phillips Screwdriver!\" Boy, was I hot that night!<br />\n.Not as hot, however, as a certain couple by the pinball<br />\nmachine. My eyes just happened to take a gander over in<br />\nthat direction and I saw them intertwined like a double<br />\nhelix. By itself that is not enough to raise even an<br />\neyebrow,but the way their bodies churned and grinded,<br />\nand the way his hand ran mad circles over her back and<br />\nlower still, disappearing in the close space between them,<br />\na glimpse of a darting tongue, the groans for chrissakes,<br />\nthe groans! Oh, no, all this was too much for my tired and<br />\nlonely bones. Were they actually mAing love?

No<br />\nsooner would he join a group (or form one, as would<br />\noften be the case later in his career), therthe would walk<br />\nout, bored. For this<br />\nreason, Clapton is somewhat<br />\nof a refreshing rarity in a business where stagnation is<br />\noften accepted by artists once they find a comfortable<br />\nand wealthy niche.<br />\nClapton's track record is as follows: after a year's stint<br />\nWith the Yardbirds, he quit when he decided they were<br />\naiming only for success of the Top 40 variety. This was<br />\nhis blues period; anything else was sacrilegious. In 1965,<br />\nhe joined John Mayan's Bluesbreakers and shared lead<br />\nguitar duties with Jimmy Page. The Mayall band broke up<br />\nIn 1967, the year that saw the dawn of psychedelia and<br />\nCream, the prototypical 3-man group that was admittedly<br />\nClapton and a rhythm section (although Ginger Baker and<br />\nJack Bruce are not your run-of-the-mill rhythm section).<br />\nTwo years later, Clapton tired of the explosive energy<br />\nof Cream, left the group, and began jamming and touring<br />\nIn America with more laid-back musicians like Delaney<br />\nand Bonnie and Friends. Clapton released his first solo<br />\nalbum back in 1970 and one year later formed Derek and<br />\n<br />\nHalf A Dozen<br />\n<br />\nthe Dominos. The Dominos put out the legendary Layla,<br />\ntoured once, disbanded, and for Clapton the next three<br />\nyears were ones of seclusion and heroin addiction.<br />\nIn 1975, he rebounded gamely and his music took yet<br />\nanother new direction. The nickname \"Slowhand\" started<br />\nlosing some of its irony and took on a certain<br />\nappropriateness. Clapton now shied away from the<br />\ntrademark tortuous licks, and his guitar became more a<br />\npart of the rhythm section. There was also an added<br />\nemphasis on his voice. The first album to reflect this shift<br />\nin style was 461 Ocean Boulevard, which included<br />\nClapton's first hit single in nearly 4 years, \"I Shot the<br />\nSheriff.\" Though sticking with this more basic style<br />\nduring his last three or four albums, he continues to<br />\nexplore, going from blues to reggae to Latin to pop, and<br />\nso on.<br />\nThat brings us to the present and Clapton's most recent<br />\nrelease, Siowhand. This album is more pop-oriented,<br />\nthough not in the ordinary sense of the word (to most<br />\npeople, \"pop\" means the Bee Gees or Barry Manilow).<br />\nUnlike common pop fare, the songs on Slowhand, which<br />\nmight be described as accessible,do not go stale after<br />\nseveral listens; rather, they grow on one. The album opens<br />\nwith, \"Cocaine,\" a tune written by one of Clapton's<br />\nfavorite songwriters, J.J. Cale. With its surging double<br />\nguitar lead, the song is reminiscent of early Credence<br />\nClearwater Revival.<br />\nThe term \"infectious beat\" may be a cliche, but it's the<br />\n<br />\nModern Exhibit<br />\nBy CHRIS STUTZ<br />\n<br />\nBY ROS RESNICK<br />\nSix Men by Alistairc Cooke. 205 pp. Alfred A.

In Six Men, Cooke draws upon his intimate<br />\nknowledge of American and British celebrities to provide<br />\nPithy, anecdotal sketches that reveal not only the<br />\nPersonalities of famous men, but also that of Cooke, then<br />\nan aspiring journalist.<br />\nCooke's Six Men arc Charlie Chaplin, Edward VIII,<br />\nMencken, Adlai Stevenson, Bertrand Russell, and<br />\nHumphrey Bogart. In his preface, Cooke states that he<br />\nselected this ensemble because \"they arc six men I have<br />\nadmired and also liked.\" Cooke also answers the riddle of<br />\nhow he, \"an obscure journalist,\" managed to become<br />\nintimate with these \"gods.\" It appears that these greats<br />\ntook to him for both personal and PR reasons.<br />\nSix Men examines these celebrities' personal lives,<br />\ntouching upon their charms and frailties. Cooke is quick<br />\nto announce his admiration of these men, but, as an<br />\nonmiscient observer, he cannot help but portray their<br />\ntragic flaws and absurdities. The Chaplin sketch, perhaps<br />\nthe collection's best, demonstrates the dichotomy<br />\nbetween Chaplin -the -little-tramp and<br />\nChaplin-the-individual. We see the young Cooke, recently<br />\narrived on a fellowship to study American theatre, being<br />\nCharmed by Chaplin and taken into his confidence. The<br />\nOlder Cooke more objectively notes Chaplin's<br />\nIdiosy nc racies<br />\nhis sexual excapades, intellectual<br />\nbragadoccio, whimsical mood shifts, and misunderstood<br />\nPolitical views. Yet Cooke does not condemn. He<br />\nconcludes the chapter: \"The film industry, which in the<br />\nscary decade after the Second War had hastened to keep<br />\nhir at a distance...made it up to him in a stagy<br />\nSycophantic way when he was in his 86th year.... He was<br />\nvery old and trembly and groping through the thickening<br />\nfog of memory for a few simple sentences. A senile,<br />\nharmless doll, he was now \u2014 as the song says \u2014 easy to<br />\nlove, absolutely safe to adore.\"<br />\nCooke renders an excellent sketch of Baltimore's own<br />\nMencken, steadfastly turning out unpopular political<br />\nCopy and equally steadfastly supporting his Sunpapers.<br />\nThe Humphrey Bogart piece does not quite measure up to<br />\nthe 'ame high quality of the others \u2014 mainly because<br />\n.11ogart turns out to be a reticent gentleman with Puritan<br />\nI nstincts. Cooke does better to stick with the eccentrics.<br />\nRe-viewing the past from the vantage point of age and<br />\nsuccess, Cooke examines his early egotism. He recalls that<br />\nUPon discovering that he and Edward VIII were wearing<br />\ni dentical suits, \"this happy co-incidence, on the snobbish<br />\n\u00b0xford scorecard of the day, put me one up with one<br />\nhole to play.\" The Edward VIII sketch also lights upon<br />\nCooke's frenzied broadcasts of the Wallis Simpson affair<br />\na trying and thrilling time for a young journalist.<br />\nThough excellent in all respects, Six Men must not be<br />\n<br />\nTwo exhibits of modem art opened this month at the<br />\nBaltimore Museum of Art. One, selections from the<br />\ncollection of Robert and Jane Meyerhoff, features he<br />\nwork of contemporary artists such as Rothko, de<br />\nKooning, Frank Stella and Robert Rauschenberg. The<br />\ntwenty paintings hanging in the May Gallery represent the<br />\nAbstract Expressionists of the late fifties and early sixties,<br />\nas well as the post-Abstract Expressionist generation<br />\n(Stella, Rauschenberg, Noland, and Ellsworth Kelly).<br />\nFor those who are unable to visit New York museums<br />\nand galleries, this show offers a taste of some of the best<br />\npainting in recent years. However, if one is accustomed to<br />\nviewing art such as that found in the Museum of Modern<br />\nArt and the Guggenheim, for example, this show just<br />\nmight be somewhat of a bore.<br />\nAs one would expect, the Rauschenbergs stand out. So<br />\ndoes the Dubuffet. The assembly of works by Rothko,<br />\nStill, de Kooning, Pollock, Albers, and minimalist Agnes<br />\nMartin, while certainly impressive in name, is<br />\ndisappointing. Very little about these artists is exciting<br />\nanymore. Their painting has become so recognizable that<br />\nit carries little impact.<br />\nA very exciting show in the main gallery area is the<br />\nphotography of New Yorker Russell Drisch. Drisch<br />\ncombines photography and watercolor to acieve unusual<br />\nartistic effects.<br />\nUnlike Photo Realism, a style of painting which<br />\nemulated photography, D isch's technique is to embellish<br />\nthe photographic image with watercolor paint and<br />\nread as definitive biography. Cooke recounts a personal<br />\nhistory, in a sense similar to Fawn Brodie's controversial<br />\npsycho-history of Thomas Jefferson. Private anecdotes<br />\nmake only one-third the man; the remaining portion<br />\nincludes his public actions and image. But I do not mean<br />\nto label Cooke as superficial. Each sketch emits the<br />\nauthoritative ring so familiar to viewers of Masterpiece<br />\nTheatre.<br />\n<br />\nAltman's \"Three Women\" will be here<br />\n<br />\nthis weekend.<br />\n<br />\nbest way to describe,\"Lay Down Sally,\" which includes a<br />\nbeautifully understated lead by Clapton. It's interesting to<br />\ncontrast his work on this song with his playing on, say,<br />\n\"Crossroads\" by Cream. \"Lay Down Sally\" recently<br />\nentered the Top 40 charts and is making AM radio a little<br />\nmore palatable these days.<br />\nAnother highlight of Slowhand is \"The Core,\" which<br />\nrecalls \"Let It Rain,\" from Eric Clapton, and \"Keep On<br />\nGrowing,\" from Layla. Exciting instrumental work, like<br />\nthe duel between Mel Collins' saxophone and Clapton's<br />\nguitar, make this one of the more powerful tracks on the<br />\nalbum.<br />\n\"Mean Old Frisco\" answers the question of what would<br />\nhappen if one of rock's best guitarists tried his hand at<br />\nslide. The results are pleasantly surprising. Though<br />\nClapton is no Duane Allman, he handles himself quite<br />\ncapably and manages to come up with his own distinctive<br />\nstyle of playing slide.<br />\nOverall, Slowhand is a competent piece of rock music.<br />\nClapton's musicals as usual excel at providing clean and<br />\ntasteful backup, while his voice sounds as relaxed as ever.<br />\nThe record-buyer looking for meaningful lyrics might<br />\nbeware; though not at all embarrassing, the words are<br />\nsecondary in these songs. The emphasis with Clapton is on<br />\ninstrumentation, which is always of a high quality.<br />\nIt's usually interesting when Eric Clapton comes out<br />\nwith a new record just to see what changes he's currently<br />\ntaking his music through,<br />\n\u2022<br />\nsometimes pencil, to create unnatural shadows and<br />\nillusions. The result is a large photograph which resembles<br />\na painting. Particularly striking is the \"Yaddo\" series, in<br />\nwhich Drisch uses pencil to augment he grainy texture of<br />\nsculpture.<br />\nThe Meyerhoff show will be at the museum through<br />\nApril 19. and the Drisch show will run throug.h April 16.<br />\n<br />\nRobert Rauschenberg mixed media<br />\niconstruction at Baltimore museum.<br />\n<br />\nTheatre Project<br />\nFilms, music, and dance comprise the weekend fare at the<br />\nTheatre Project, 45 West Presto:i Street, through Sunday.<br />\nIn collaboration with the Baltimore Film Forum, the<br />\nTheatre Project's Studio Theatre will present its first<br />\n\"Weekend of Film\" series, featuring Chaplin movies at 8<br />\nP.M., 1,0 P.M., and midnight Friday.

Why<br />\nhad the coach called a sudden<br />\npre-practice meeting? But even<br />\nthis slight curiousity could not<br />\nspoil the air of excitement and<br />\njubilation that had overcome the<br />\nbasketball players for the past<br />\nweek. And why not? They had<br />\njust capped an eleven win out of<br />\nthirteen game streak with a<br />\nmagnificent victory over Franklin<br />\nand Marshall; a victory that had<br />\neluded them for the past five<br />\nyears. They had just placed<br />\nsecond in the Southeastern<br />\nDivision of the Middle Atlantic<br />\nConference; a spot that had<br />\nescaped them for the past three<br />\nyears. And, of course, they had<br />\njust earned the right to go to the<br />\nMAC playoffs, to face a team<br />\nthat they knew in their hearts<br />\nthey could beat.<br />\nYes, they had travelled a long<br />\nroad to get to this point. Way<br />\nback in November and December<br />\nthey had battled haplessly against<br />\nmuch stronger teams and came<br />\nout of it smelling rather bad with<br />\nan 0-10 mark. But during that<br />\ntime tbe boys had built up their<br />\nconfidence, built up their ability,<br />\nand were ready to face the rest of<br />\ntheir competition. Players like<br />\nRandy Lovallo, Kevin Kabat, and<br />\nHoward Drew who had more<br />\nthan doubled their scoring<br />\naverages over last season were set<br />\nto take on the challenge offered<br />\nby the MAC.

The<br />\nmost obvious cause was the flu,<br />\nwhich had affected many<br />\nmembers of the team; in<br />\nparticular, Dave Mann, the team's<br />\nnumber one epee fencer, had to<br />\nsit out the meet (the epee team<br />\nwas 1-8 against William and<br />\nMary).

This \u2022<br />\nreferendum is not to be taken lightly. Too many<br />\ntimes in 'the past has the Council succeeded in<br />\nramrodding the students. Indeed, we urge that<br />\neveryone slog their way through the Constitution<br />\nas it is presented in today's issue and decide, with<br />\nsome ch ought, the relative merits of this<br />\ndocument. After giving the proposal much<br />\nconsideration, the News-Letter has no qualms in<br />\nurging a \"No\" vote.<br />\nTo go through the constituion clause by clause would take up too much .space and time.<br />\nHowever, there are several major points which are<br />\nindicative of the Constitution's shortcomings..<br />\nThe proposed Constitution is filled with -bad<br />\nwriting, murky definitions, useless verbiage and<br />\nvapid content. Supposedly the Council has been<br />\nworking since the beginning of the school year on<br />\nthe proposal. The effort is not readily apparent.<br />\nIn the first articles we are presented with a<br />\npicture of the Imperial Council. \"The Student<br />\nCouncil and its designates are the sole<br />\nrepresentatives of the Students.\" Are the<br />\nstudents incapable of representing themselves by<br />\nother means? To answer this question in the<br />\naffirmative (as the Council seemingly has). is<br />\nabsurd. The students are very capable of acting<br />\nand speaking for themselves. The students have a<br />\ngolden opportunity to prove this by voting \"No\"<br />\nnext week.<br />\nThe exclusiveness of the Imperial Council<br />\npermeates Article II. \"Any Student who shows<br />\nsincere interest and ability ill working with the<br /><br />\nStudent Council, may work on a Student council<br />\ncommittee.\" Exactly how is a \"sincere interest<br />\nand ability\" evaluated? More often than not, it is<br />\nevaluated by the closeness of the personal<br />\nrelationship between the chooser and chosen. It<br />\nis hardly believable that the Council would be so<br />\nblatantly political in a proposal presented to the<br />\nentire student body. Maybe it is just another<br />\nindication of the Council's low esteem of the<br />\nstudents.<br />\nA deluded omnipotence is the main feature of<br />\nArticle III. \"A. Inquire, speak, and act on behalf<br />\nof the Students. B. Coordinate and implement a<br />\nvaried and invigorating social calendar.\" It is<br />\ngetting almost comical now to read the COuncil's<br />\ncondescension towards the students. Now we<br />\ndiscover one of their main goals is to keep us<br />\n\"invigorated\" with an exciting menu of social<br />\nevents. Whoopee. This must be overwhelmingly<br />\nimportant to the Council because in Article IV,<br />\nthe executive position of Social Director is<br />\ncreated, a position before known only in summer<br />\ncamps and resort hotels. The image of two<br />\nthousand Hopkins students standing in the lower<br />\nquad playing \"Simon Says\" comes easily to<br />\nmind. Needless to say, the idea of a campus-wide<br />\nvote on a Social Director is ridiculous. We would<br />\nmuch rather prefer the simple and logicil<br />\nprocedure of letting the Selections Committee<br />\nappoint a Social Committee chairman. The vision<br />\nof a student being elected Social Director on his<br />\npromise of more beer nights in the Rat is<br />\ncertainly horrifying.<br />\nHidden in the back of the Constitution is<br />\nArticle VII which deals with impeachment.<br />\nTwenty per cent of the students (approximately<br /><br />\n400 people, the size of a large Chemistry class)<br />\nare needed to sign an impeachment petition.<br />\nBefore this petition can be acted upon by a<br />\nstudent referendum, the cause for impeachment<br />\nmust be verified by the student members of the<br />\nAcademic Ethics Board. Nowhere in. this<br />\nConstitution can one find any definition of the<br />\ngrounds for impeachment. Apparently, the valid<br />\nreasons are a secret known only to the Academic<br />\nEthics Board. The student members of the board<br />\n(numbering no more than ten) can squelch the<br />\nvoice of 400 students. Surely if one wanted to<br />\navoid impeachment, this is the easiest way to go<br />\nabout it.<br />\nThe Council has seemingly never heard of tile<br />\nSunshine Laws being passed in almost every state.<br />\nIn Article VIII, the Council proposes a complex<br />\nset of rules to establish and regulate closed<br />\nsessions. We find it mighty hard to conceive of a<br />\nset of circumstances that would necessitate a<br />\nclosed session. Perhaps a clandestine meeting to.<br />\ndiscuss ways of buffaloing this Constituion<br />\nthrough the Students would be a possibility.<br />\nWe won't even bother to mention the tangled<br />\nweb of bureaucratic doubletalk concerning SAC<br />\ngroups. This was the part of the old Constitution<br />\nthat needed the most revision but of course not<br />\neven the slightest change was made. There is little<br />\nrecommend in this new Constitution. Perhaps the<br />\nonly re-deeming feature of this \"document\" is<br />\nthat it presents proof of. the Council's<br />\nineffectiveness and ineptitude in ascertaining its<br />\nown role. Perhaps their motive is to keep us as<br />\nuninformed as themselves.<br /><br />\nletters to the editor<br />\nT o the Editor:<br />\nRe: Corrections to the article I<br />\nof February 17, 1978, Volume<br />\nLXXII, Number XVIII, pages 1<br />\nand 2, \"Residents protest Charles<br />\nSecurity, Heat Conditions\", by<br />\nDan Wile.<br />\nSeveral errors occurred in the<br />\nprinting of that article.

I recall<br />\none incident in particular which illustrates this<br />\nphenomenon perfectly: Dixie Dick and I had cornered<br />\ntwo busty beauties in the corner of a crowded Tephousc<br />\nanteroom, and were avidly trying to assess their\u2022<br />\nwillingness towards accepting a ride back to their<br />\nrespective campuses. The one next to me innocently<br />\nblurts out--\"lt must be very exciting being a writer.\"--and<br />\nbefore I could work up a lecherous grin I feel the weight<br />\nof Dixie Dick's arm around my shoulder and hear a tiny<br />\nthud as his car keys clandestinely drop into my coat<br />\npocket. Not to be outdone, the one next to Dixie turns<br />\nup her devastating baby browns and coos--\"You look<br />\nasthough you work out a lot.\" It hurts, but I can't deny<br />\nthe facts. Finding a quick jocular excuse to fling my arm<br />\naround Dixie Dick's shoulders, I reluctantly redeposit the<br />\nkeys in his jacket.<br />\nAs if on cue, my chesty cherub now bubbles--\"I'm so<br />\ntired of this party. I wish I could wrangle a ride home<br />\nfrom somebody nice.\" Again the arm falling across my<br />\ncollarbone and my roommate's deep-thtoated laugh cover<br />\nthe keys' jangle,as they fall into place against my hip. For<br />\na moment it looks like close cooperation has carried the<br />\nday once .again. For a second it seems as though selfless<br />\nsacrifice will make yet another grab at the golden ring<br />\npossible for this lonely scribe. Unfortunately, all the<br />\npawing Dixie Dick ..;ind I have been doing at each other<br />\nduring the course of this complicated operation has<br />\nthoroughly - convinced the - two girls that we are<br />\nhomosexuals of the first water--they quickly excuse<br />\nthemselves amid stilled giggles and walk away in disgust..<br /><br />\nBy tar the most exciting aspect of frat life is that<br />\ninterval between Rush Week and the first flowering of<br />\nSpring, when, all over campus, the new pledges do battle<br />\nwith their brothers-to-be. Many people are disgusted by<br />\nthese \u2022 annual antics, labeling them as \"juvenile\" or<br />\n\"class,\" but I see them as nothing more sinister than<br />\nharmless entertainment for the student body. I think it<br />\nadds a touch of drama to the mundane collegiate grind to<br />\nsee groups of marauders sneaking about, whip cream in<br />\nhand, waiting to savagely pounce on an unsuspecting<br />\nvictim.<br />\n.1 remember my freshman year, when quite a few of my<br />\nfriends were sleeping with one eye open and never turning<br />\ntheir goose-pimply backs to open doorways. There was<br />\none .chap at the end of our hall who, by using his<br />\nformidable wits, had somehow miraculously avoided<br />\nchastisement of any kind all spring. But the word was<br />\nout--he was a hunted man. Determined not to succumb,<br />\nhe locked himself in his room and struck a deal with me. I<br />\nwas to slip beef jerky under the door three times a day<br />\nand supply him with adequate fresh water. The latter<br />\nwas accomplished by placing a small bucket in front of the<br />\n\u2022door and slipping a long, plastic tube into the room which<br />\nhe could suck like a straw. In this way he hoped to spend<br />\nthe weekend in complete safety until the official end of<br />\nhostilities on Monday morning. (Oh, yes, he also<br />\nconsumed mass quantities of Kaopectate in order to<br />\nkeen'bodily wastes at a minimum.) Ilis brothers tried time<br />\nand time again to lure him out, but since he would<br />\nrespond only to my voice, their efforts were in vain.<br />\nThen, Sunday night, they came to me with a<br />\nproposition of their own. If! would sell my pal, they said,<br />\nI would be the proud owner of a bottle of Gin. Naturally,<br />\nI was indignant. Being a man of honor and high moral<br />\nprinciples, I informed them that I could be had for<br />\nnothing less than a bottle of Chevas. This they happily<br />\nproduced. So, while I told my captive chum to prepare<br />\nfor what he thought was a cool drink, the fratman quietly<br />\nconnected the end of the tube to a small glass of Tobasco<br />\nsauce. I must admit, I felt a twinge of guilt when I heard<br />\nthe scream of animal pain which erupted from behind the<br />\nlocked door. What followed was a loud choking that<br />\nsounded like someone was drowning cats, and then a long<br />\n-cry of\"Waaatcer!! Waaaater!!!\"<br />\n\"Come on out, pledge,\" taunted the fratmen, \"we've<br />\ngot water!!\"<br />\nIndeed they did--two trash cans full. And mixed in with<br />\nit were some of the vilest liquids it's ever been<br />\nmymisfortune to smell. Needless to say, my even more<br />\nunfortunate friend wound up wearing it. Funniest damn<br />\nthing I ever did see.<br /><br />\nLOST INNOCENCE<br /><br />\nMiss Fill and the lucky winner.<br />\n\"Down in front!\" shrieked the drunk pre-nled,<br />\nwishing to instigate a nasty ruckus I moved to or<br />\nbut still the bespectacled and besmirched nerd scl<br />\n\"Down in front! Goddamnit! Down in front!\"<br />\nAt that moment I realized his wino whines<br />\nmeant for my ears, but for the rather lubricio'<br />\nvisible talents of Miss Fifi, the slatternly strippef '<br />\nto entice innocent freshmen like myself into<br />\nof iniquity. My head w:s lost in the head of the tlat<br />\ncontinually flushed down my throat. Was I e<br />\npledge? Would they accept me if I did?

Of course there was no Rat back<br />\nthen, so the houses really had,a monopoly on getting<br />\npeople wasted, but there was more to it then that--much<br />\nmore. I remember one fella in particular, by the name of<br />\nJoJo Samples, who really lived for 'em, know what I<br />\nmean? Now JoJo was about six-three and two-thirty at<br />\nleast, and he'd put the brew away a quart at a time<br />\nwithout stopping for air. Never had to hit the can<br />\neither--it just disappeared down his throat and wasn't ever<br />\nheard from again. All the brothers were petrified<br />\nWhenever JoJo stepped through their door, because they<br />\nknew damn well before he left someone or something<br />\nwould get busted up pretty good. J recall one night when<br />\nthere was an altercation at Sig Ep, and for reasons. that<br />\nnever became clear, JoJo got pushed out the third story<br />\nwindow and landed on his head. Needless to say, a crowd<br />\nquickly gathered around him on the lawn. A passing<br />\npatrolman walked up and asked, \"What happened, son?\"<br />\n\"I don't know,\" said JoJo, \"I just got here myself.\"<br />\nNot long on brains, ole JoJo, but one hell of a partyer.<br />\n\"Then there was the time he was refused service at a<br />\nfrat when it became clear that he . was intoxicated far<br />\nbeyond the point of no return. Upon hearing the refusal,<br />\nhe leveled a stare at the barkeep that would have made<br />\nSatan himself soil his drawers, and silently marched out<br />\nthe door. All those involved breathed a sigh of relief<br />\nbut their peace of mind was destined to be short-lived.<br />\nJoJo returned barely half an hour later brandishing a .006<br />\nshotgun and a six-inch Bowie knife. \u2022 He proceeded<br />\nunmolested to the bar, leveled his weapon at the petrified<br />\npledge behind it, and snai led, \"Start pourin', pissant!\" He<br />\nhad\" finished six glasses in quick succession and was<br />\nworking on his seventh when he suddenly pitched<br />\nbackwards and collapsed into a fermenting heap on the<br />\nfloor. The -scatter- gun was later found to be empty and<br />\nthe knife nothing but a rubber imitation, but, in the<br />\nfuture, all JoJo's requests for ,liquid refreshment were<br />\nanswered as proMptly, and courteously, as was humanly<br />\nPossible.<br />\n\"Nosir,\" says the cap'n, returning from his nostalgic<br />\nteverie, \"they just don't make 'em like ole JoJo Samples<br />\nanymore.

Drifting in the foggy nether-world twixt<br />\nalcoholic stupor and bedwetting sleep, a distant, rhythmic<br />\nchanting came wafting in from the hall. \"Some asshole<br />\npracticing his mantra,\" I mumbled, and, opening the<br />\ndoor, prepared to give the miscreant a rather derogatory<br />\nassessment of Eastern religions. I was ill prepared forwhat<br />\nI saw.. Coming down the hallway were six figures<br />\ncompletely covered with heavy -purple cloaks, which<br />\ndraggedalong behind them on the floor! One of these<br />\nghostly apparitions carried an incense burner in one hand<br />\nand an ornate sceptre in the other. A thousand panicky<br />\nthoughts darted through my eighty-proof brain:<br />\nThe Ku Klux Klan!<br />\nThe Mansons!<br />\nCrazed Dominicans!!!<br />\nMercifully, the eerie crew passed by without even a<br />\nsideways glance, and filed silently into the room next<br />\ndoor. Ear pressed to the cinderblock, I listened as the<br />\ninterrogation began.<br />\n\"Pledge!! Do you love your<br />\nbrothers?\"<br />\n'Ye-ye-yes.\" came the halting reply.<br />\n\"Would you do anything for your brothers?\"<br />\n'Ye-yes.

As an old-timer I've<br />\nseen it all. I've seen pre-meds go crazy in Hutzler, a<br />\nsudden geyser of notes and books, a resounding,\"Fuck it<br />\nall!\" I've seen nitwits fry theirl brains in too much acid<br />\nand prance about campus do-dahing Pink Floyd songs<br />\nand in the middle of May innocently ask, \"Why didn't<br />\nyou tell me there were final exams?\" Well, I'd thought I'd<br />\nseen it all, until one 'rush party at Sig Ep (you would<br />\nfigure it out anyway) just a few weeks ago. It sort of<br />\nshakes up an old man's day for something unpredictable<br />\nto happen.<br />\nI was feeling quite mellow, as is my wont on Friday<br />\nnight after a tough week of classes. My tongue was<br />\nloosened by several shots of cheap whiskey and thusly<br />\nbecame the lucid instrument of witty execution one<br />\nwould expect of Jerry Lewis at a debutante ball. \"What<br />\ndo you expect when you mix gin and milk of magnesia?\"<br />\n\"A Phillips Screwdriver!\" Boy, was I hot that night!<br />\n.Not as hot, however, as a certain couple by the pinball<br />\nmachine. My eyes just happened to take a gander over in<br />\nthat direction and I saw them intertwined like a double<br />\nhelix. By itself that is not enough to raise even an<br />\neyebrow,but the way their bodies churned and grinded,<br />\nand the way his hand ran mad circles over her back and<br />\nlower still, disappearing in the close space between them,<br />\na glimpse of a darting tongue, the groans for chrissakes,<br />\nthe groans! Oh, no, all this was too much for my tired and<br />\nlonely bones. Were they actually mAing love?

No<br />\nsooner would he join a group (or form one, as would<br />\noften be the case later in his career), therthe would walk<br />\nout, bored. For this<br />\nreason, Clapton is somewhat<br />\nof a refreshing rarity in a business where stagnation is<br />\noften accepted by artists once they find a comfortable<br />\nand wealthy niche.<br />\nClapton's track record is as follows: after a year's stint<br />\nWith the Yardbirds, he quit when he decided they were<br />\naiming only for success of the Top 40 variety. This was<br />\nhis blues period; anything else was sacrilegious. In 1965,<br />\nhe joined John Mayan's Bluesbreakers and shared lead<br />\nguitar duties with Jimmy Page. The Mayall band broke up<br />\nIn 1967, the year that saw the dawn of psychedelia and<br />\nCream, the prototypical 3-man group that was admittedly<br />\nClapton and a rhythm section (although Ginger Baker and<br />\nJack Bruce are not your run-of-the-mill rhythm section).<br />\nTwo years later, Clapton tired of the explosive energy<br />\nof Cream, left the group, and began jamming and touring<br />\nIn America with more laid-back musicians like Delaney<br />\nand Bonnie and Friends. Clapton released his first solo<br />\nalbum back in 1970 and one year later formed Derek and<br /><br />\nHalf A Dozen<br /><br />\nthe Dominos. The Dominos put out the legendary Layla,<br />\ntoured once, disbanded, and for Clapton the next three<br />\nyears were ones of seclusion and heroin addiction.<br />\nIn 1975, he rebounded gamely and his music took yet<br />\nanother new direction. The nickname \"Slowhand\" started<br />\nlosing some of its irony and took on a certain<br />\nappropriateness. Clapton now shied away from the<br />\ntrademark tortuous licks, and his guitar became more a<br />\npart of the rhythm section. There was also an added<br />\nemphasis on his voice. The first album to reflect this shift<br />\nin style was 461 Ocean Boulevard, which included<br />\nClapton's first hit single in nearly 4 years, \"I Shot the<br />\nSheriff.\" Though sticking with this more basic style<br />\nduring his last three or four albums, he continues to<br />\nexplore, going from blues to reggae to Latin to pop, and<br />\nso on.<br />\nThat brings us to the present and Clapton's most recent<br />\nrelease, Siowhand. This album is more pop-oriented,<br />\nthough not in the ordinary sense of the word (to most<br />\npeople, \"pop\" means the Bee Gees or Barry Manilow).<br />\nUnlike common pop fare, the songs on Slowhand, which<br />\nmight be described as accessible,do not go stale after<br />\nseveral listens; rather, they grow on one. The album opens<br />\nwith, \"Cocaine,\" a tune written by one of Clapton's<br />\nfavorite songwriters, J.J. Cale. With its surging double<br />\nguitar lead, the song is reminiscent of early Credence<br />\nClearwater Revival.<br />\nThe term \"infectious beat\" may be a cliche, but it's the<br /><br />\nModern Exhibit<br />\nBy CHRIS STUTZ<br /><br />\nBY ROS RESNICK<br />\nSix Men by Alistairc Cooke. 205 pp. Alfred A. Knopf.<br />\n$8.95. Available at the Johns Hopkins Book Center.<br />\nBetter known to younger Americans as the host of<br />\nBBC's Masterpiece Theatre, Alistaire Cooke is a renowned<br />\nJournalist who has informed BBC radio audiences about<br />\nAmerica for several decades. In 1973, Cooke published<br />\nAmerica, his televised geographical history of the United<br />\nStates. In Six Men, Cooke draws upon his intimate<br />\nknowledge of American and British celebrities to provide<br />\nPithy, anecdotal sketches that reveal not only the<br />\nPersonalities of famous men, but also that of Cooke, then<br />\nan aspiring journalist.<br />\nCooke's Six Men arc Charlie Chaplin, Edward VIII,<br />\nMencken, Adlai Stevenson, Bertrand Russell, and<br />\nHumphrey Bogart. In his preface, Cooke states that he<br />\nselected this ensemble because \"they arc six men I have<br />\nadmired and also liked.\" Cooke also answers the riddle of<br />\nhow he, \"an obscure journalist,\" managed to become<br />\nintimate with these \"gods.\" It appears that these greats<br />\ntook to him for both personal and PR reasons.<br />\nSix Men examines these celebrities' personal lives,<br />\ntouching upon their charms and frailties. Cooke is quick<br />\nto announce his admiration of these men, but, as an<br />\nonmiscient observer, he cannot help but portray their<br />\ntragic flaws and absurdities. The Chaplin sketch, perhaps<br />\nthe collection's best, demonstrates the dichotomy<br />\nbetween Chaplin -the -little-tramp and<br />\nChaplin-the-individual. We see the young Cooke, recently<br />\narrived on a fellowship to study American theatre, being<br />\nCharmed by Chaplin and taken into his confidence. The<br />\nOlder Cooke more objectively notes Chaplin's<br />\nIdiosy nc racies<br />\nhis sexual excapades, intellectual<br />\nbragadoccio, whimsical mood shifts, and misunderstood<br />\nPolitical views. Yet Cooke does not condemn. He<br />\nconcludes the chapter: \"The film industry, which in the<br />\nscary decade after the Second War had hastened to keep<br />\nhir at a distance...made it up to him in a stagy<br />\nSycophantic way when he was in his 86th year.... He was<br />\nvery old and trembly and groping through the thickening<br />\nfog of memory for a few simple sentences. A senile,<br />\nharmless doll, he was now \u2014 as the song says \u2014 easy to<br />\nlove, absolutely safe to adore.\"<br />\nCooke renders an excellent sketch of Baltimore's own<br />\nMencken, steadfastly turning out unpopular political<br />\nCopy and equally steadfastly supporting his Sunpapers.<br />\nThe Humphrey Bogart piece does not quite measure up to<br />\nthe 'ame high quality of the others \u2014 mainly because<br />\n.11ogart turns out to be a reticent gentleman with Puritan<br />\nI nstincts. Cooke does better to stick with the eccentrics.<br />\nRe-viewing the past from the vantage point of age and<br />\nsuccess, Cooke examines his early egotism. He recalls that<br />\nUPon discovering that he and Edward VIII were wearing<br />\ni dentical suits, \"this happy co-incidence, on the snobbish<br />\n\u00b0xford scorecard of the day, put me one up with one<br />\nhole to play.\" The Edward VIII sketch also lights upon<br />\nCooke's frenzied broadcasts of the Wallis Simpson affair<br />\na trying and thrilling time for a young journalist.<br />\nThough excellent in all respects, Six Men must not be<br /><br />\nTwo exhibits of modem art opened this month at the<br />\nBaltimore Museum of Art. One, selections from the<br />\ncollection of Robert and Jane Meyerhoff, features he<br />\nwork of contemporary artists such as Rothko, de<br />\nKooning, Frank Stella and Robert Rauschenberg. The<br />\ntwenty paintings hanging in the May Gallery represent the<br />\nAbstract Expressionists of the late fifties and early sixties,<br />\nas well as the post-Abstract Expressionist generation<br />\n(Stella, Rauschenberg, Noland, and Ellsworth Kelly).<br />\nFor those who are unable to visit New York museums<br />\nand galleries, this show offers a taste of some of the best<br />\npainting in recent years. However, if one is accustomed to<br />\nviewing art such as that found in the Museum of Modern<br />\nArt and the Guggenheim, for example, this show just<br />\nmight be somewhat of a bore.<br />\nAs one would expect, the Rauschenbergs stand out. So<br />\ndoes the Dubuffet. The assembly of works by Rothko,<br />\nStill, de Kooning, Pollock, Albers, and minimalist Agnes<br />\nMartin, while certainly impressive in name, is<br />\ndisappointing. Very little about these artists is exciting<br />\nanymore. Their painting has become so recognizable that<br />\nit carries little impact.<br />\nA very exciting show in the main gallery area is the<br />\nphotography of New Yorker Russell Drisch. Drisch<br />\ncombines photography and watercolor to acieve unusual<br />\nartistic effects.<br />\nUnlike Photo Realism, a style of painting which<br />\nemulated photography, D isch's technique is to embellish<br />\nthe photographic image with watercolor paint and<br />\nread as definitive biography. Cooke recounts a personal<br />\nhistory, in a sense similar to Fawn Brodie's controversial<br />\npsycho-history of Thomas Jefferson. Private anecdotes<br />\nmake only one-third the man; the remaining portion<br />\nincludes his public actions and image. But I do not mean<br />\nto label Cooke as superficial. Each sketch emits the<br />\nauthoritative ring so familiar to viewers of Masterpiece<br />\nTheatre.<br /><br />\nAltman's \"Three Women\" will be here<br /><br />\nthis weekend.<br /><br />\nbest way to describe,\"Lay Down Sally,\" which includes a<br />\nbeautifully understated lead by Clapton. It's interesting to<br />\ncontrast his work on this song with his playing on, say,<br />\n\"Crossroads\" by Cream. \"Lay Down Sally\" recently<br />\nentered the Top 40 charts and is making AM radio a little<br />\nmore palatable these days.<br />\nAnother highlight of Slowhand is \"The Core,\" which<br />\nrecalls \"Let It Rain,\" from Eric Clapton, and \"Keep On<br />\nGrowing,\" from Layla. Exciting instrumental work, like<br />\nthe duel between Mel Collins' saxophone and Clapton's<br />\nguitar, make this one of the more powerful tracks on the<br />\nalbum.<br />\n\"Mean Old Frisco\" answers the question of what would<br />\nhappen if one of rock's best guitarists tried his hand at<br />\nslide. The results are pleasantly surprising. Though<br />\nClapton is no Duane Allman, he handles himself quite<br />\ncapably and manages to come up with his own distinctive<br />\nstyle of playing slide.<br />\nOverall, Slowhand is a competent piece of rock music.<br />\nClapton's musicals as usual excel at providing clean and<br />\ntasteful backup, while his voice sounds as relaxed as ever.<br />\nThe record-buyer looking for meaningful lyrics might<br />\nbeware; though not at all embarrassing, the words are<br />\nsecondary in these songs. The emphasis with Clapton is on<br />\ninstrumentation, which is always of a high quality.<br />\nIt's usually interesting when Eric Clapton comes out<br />\nwith a new record just to see what changes he's currently<br />\ntaking his music through,<br />\n\u2022<br />\nsometimes pencil, to create unnatural shadows and<br />\nillusions. The result is a large photograph which resembles<br />\na painting. Particularly striking is the \"Yaddo\" series, in<br />\nwhich Drisch uses pencil to augment he grainy texture of<br />\nsculpture.<br />\nThe Meyerhoff show will be at the museum through<br />\nApril 19. and the Drisch show will run throug.h April 16.<br /><br />\nRobert Rauschenberg mixed media<br />\niconstruction at Baltimore museum.<br /><br />\nTheatre Project<br />\nFilms, music, and dance comprise the weekend fare at the<br />\nTheatre Project, 45 West Presto:i Street, through Sunday.<br />\nIn collaboration with the Baltimore Film Forum, the<br />\nTheatre Project's Studio Theatre will present its first<br />\n\"Weekend of Film\" series, featuring Chaplin movies at 8<br />\nP.M., 1,0 P.M., and midnight Friday.

Why<br />\nhad the coach called a sudden<br />\npre-practice meeting? But even<br />\nthis slight curiousity could not<br />\nspoil the air of excitement and<br />\njubilation that had overcome the<br />\nbasketball players for the past<br />\nweek. And why not? They had<br />\njust capped an eleven win out of<br />\nthirteen game streak with a<br />\nmagnificent victory over Franklin<br />\nand Marshall; a victory that had<br />\neluded them for the past five<br />\nyears. They had just placed<br />\nsecond in the Southeastern<br />\nDivision of the Middle Atlantic<br />\nConference; a spot that had<br />\nescaped them for the past three<br />\nyears. And, of course, they had<br />\njust earned the right to go to the<br />\nMAC playoffs, to face a team<br />\nthat they knew in their hearts<br />\nthey could beat.<br />\nYes, they had travelled a long<br />\nroad to get to this point.

But during that<br />\ntime tbe boys had built up their<br />\nconfidence, built up their ability,<br />\nand were ready to face the rest of<br />\ntheir competition. Players like<br />\nRandy Lovallo, Kevin Kabat, and<br />\nHoward Drew who had more<br />\nthan doubled their scoring<br />\naverages over last season were set<br />\nto take on the challenge offered<br />\nby the MAC.
