The grant<br />\nstipulates that $4 million be raised in fundraising for the library.<br />\nMcClain and Martin both expressed hopes that this goal can<br />\nbe achieved.<br />\nOne consequence of increasing<br />\nthe number of books ordered is<br />\nthe cutback in journal subscriptions. \"Prices of journal<br />\nsubscriptions are going right<br />\nthrough the roof,\" said Martin.<br />\n\"It's not unusual for the cost of<br />\n<br />\nThe extensions to the library's bookshelves.<br />\na foreign scientific journal to have Martin is considering relocating<br />\nincreased by 100 to 150 nonessential library staff offices<br />\npercent.\"<br />\noutside of MSE.<br />\nSenior David Piehl, a member<br />\nA team of University-hired arof the Library Advisory Commit- chitects has presented a feasibilitee, said \"We're in the process ty study on library expansion to<br />\nof deciding who's going to bear the Board of Trustees.

Users of the IBM,<br />\nVMS operating system, and the<br />\nAT&T 3B20 Unix operating<br />\nbeen<br />\nnot<br />\nhave<br />\nsystem<br />\novercharged.<br />\nThe Tex processing language is<br />\n<br />\ndifferent from the standard form<br />\nof printing. Tex language has a<br />\ngreater quality and gives printouts<br />\nthe look of being typeset or<br />\nprinted in a print shop. Users of<br />\nthis type of laser printing are the<br />\nonly ones being affected by the<br />\novercharging.<br />\n\"The overcharging came as a<br />\nresult of doing some upgrading to<br />\nour operating system,\" said<br />\nDavid Binko, director of<br />\nacademic computing. \"It's not<br />\njust an overcharge, but an erratic<br />\ncharge. The problem has been<br />\nfound and corrected.\"<br />\nSenior Systems Programmer<br />\n<br />\nEric Moyer<br />\n<br />\nThe Shaffer 100 computer room.<br />\n<br />\nRonald Ray concurred, saying,<br />\n\"The problem arose when the<br />\nnewest version of the operating<br />\nsystem was installed. There was<br />\na bug in the system which kept<br />\ntrack of how the pages were<br />\ncounted for printouts, resulting in<br />\nthe overcharging.\"<br />\nCost to VMS operating system<br />\nusers is expected to be minimal<br />\nbecause the problem began during Intersession and was<br />\ndiscovered quite recently.<br />\nThe computing facilities at<br />\nHopkins, for most, work on an<br />\naccount system in which users are<br />\nalloted three \"computer\" dollars<br />\nper day of computer time and<br />\nmay accumulate up to $9 for use<br />\nin one day. Printouts cost ten<br />\ncents per page.<br />\nWith a system overcharging<br />\nusers, valuable computer time<br />\ncan be be wasted. For professors,<br />\nhowever, the problems could be<br />\nmuch worse.<br />\nProfessors pay to use the computer facilities with money from<br />\ntheir grants. The large amount of<br />\ncomputer time needed, coupled<br />\nwith an overcharging system,<br />\ncould put a real strain on the<br />\nbudgets of professors, according<br />\nto graduate student Xiao-Wei<br />\nZhu, who had a friend bring the<br />\nproblem to her attention after he<br />\nwas charged $5 for seven pages<br />\nof printout.<br />\n\"Many people I spoke with<br />\nwere simply assuming that the<br />\nprice for printouts went up,\" she<br />\nsaid. \"Everyone who used the<br />\nlaser printer was being overcharged, but no one was questioning the sudden rise in printout<br />\ncost.\"<br />\n<br />\nOfficial claims U.S. should seek<br />\npolitically stable South Korea<br />\nby Weijen Chang<br />\nThe American \"security interest\" in South Korea does not<br />\novershadow its interest in the<br />\ndevelopment of an economically<br />\nand politically stable and independent South Korea, said Thomas<br />\nDunlop, director of the Office of<br />\nKorean Affairs at the Department<br />\nof State, last Thursday at 8 p.m.<br />\nin the Great Hall.<br />\nThe Johns Hopkins University<br />\nForum on Korean Affairs, in conjunction with the Department of<br />\nPolitical Science, invited Dunlop<br />\nto speak in the first of a threelecture series titled, \"Korea: A<br />\nNation in Transition.\"<br />\nDunlop began by stressing the<br />\nimportance of South Korea's<br />\ngeopolitical position in Asia\u2014<br />\nSeoul being \"equidistant from<br />\nVostok, Beijing, and Tokyo\"\u2014<br />\nand the importance of a \"stable<br />\nand peaceful Korea\" to the U.S.<br />\nBut \"because we are<br />\nAmericans,\" the U.S. does not<br />\nbelieve in forcing policies, ideals,<br />\nand governments on South<br />\nKorea, said Dunlop.<br />\n\"Unless there was a stable<br />\ngovernment [in South Korea]<br />\nwith a broad base of support,<br />\ninstability\u2014political<br />\nand<br />\neconomic\u2014would ensue,\" said<br />\nDunlop.<br />\nDespite recent trade friction,<br />\nthe U.S. would also like to see<br />\n<br />\n\"continued growth of the commercial and trade relationship\"<br />\nbetween the U.S. and South<br />\nKorea, said Dunlop.<br />\nCigarettes, beef, and insurance, three markets in South<br />\nKorea recently found to be almost<br />\nclosed to U.S. companies, make<br />\nup only about five percent of<br />\ntrade between the two nations,<br />\nstressed Dunlop.<br />\nEntry into other markets is still<br />\ndifficult for U.S. competitors,<br />\nadded Dunlop, and if the South<br />\nKorean government does not in:<br />\ncrease the rate of opening markets<br />\nto the U.S., Congress could<br />\nbecome \"punitive and protectionist\" in pasing the upcoming<br />\nOmnibus Trade Bill.<br />\nDunlop added that South Korea<br />\nis a nation which \"must export to<br />\nlive,\" and must import U.S.<br />\ngoods fairly if the U.S. imports<br />\nKorean goods fairly.<br />\nTurning to a lighter subject,<br />\nDunlop praised the strengthening<br />\ncultural ties between the U.S. and<br />\nSouth Korea, especially in light<br />\nof the rapidly growing immigration rate of Koreans to the United<br />\nStates.<br />\nAmerican politicians, added<br />\n' Dunlop, should keep in mind that<br />\na \"large and positively contributing Korean society\" will<br />\nsoon be a major part of the<br />\nAmerican constituency.<br />\nA question-and-answer session<br />\n<br />\nfollowed tfie lecture, in which the<br />\nfirst audience member asked<br />\nwhether the U.S. State Department believed that North Korea<br />\nwas responsible for the recent<br />\ncrash of a Korean Air Lines jet<br />\nover Burma, in which 115 people died.<br />\nDunlop replied that the United<br />\nStates had come to the \"horrible<br />\nconclusion\" that North Korea<br />\nhad indeed bombed the airliner,<br />\npresumably to undermine international confidence in South<br />\nKorea's ability to hold the upcoming Summer Olympic Games<br />\nin Seoul.<br />\nAsked what steps the U.S.<br />\nwould take against North Korea,<br />\nDunlop replied that although the<br />\nU.S. has tried to focus international attention and condemnation<br />\non North Korea, the government<br />\nof South Korea ultimately must<br />\ntake action itself.<br />\n\"It isn't so much what we [the<br />\nU.S.] are going to do, it is what<br />\nthe people and government of<br />\n[South] Korea are going to do,\"<br />\nhe said. \"It's their plane and their<br />\nOlympiad.\"<br />\nAlthough the U.S. has since<br />\nplaced North Korea on a \"terrorist nation list,\" the U.S. has<br />\nhad no commercial or political<br />\nties with North Korea since the<br />\nKorean War, said Dunlop, who<br />\nSee KOREA, 6<br />\n<br />\nEric Moyer<br />\n<br />\nDavid Binko, director of academic computing, who explained why<br />\nstudents and faculty have been overcharged for laser printouts.<br />\nVarious steps are being taken<br />\nto insure that the problem is rectified. The Accounting Office<br />\nprovided a \"work around\" for<br />\nusers. Several commands that can<br />\nbe used for Tex output are listed<br />\nwhen users \"log on\" to the<br />\nsystem.<br />\nAlso, Accounting requested that<br />\nthose persons who have printed<br />\nTex output should come into the<br />\noffice or send electronic mail to<br />\nthe account \"ACCOUNT\" to see<br />\nif a refund is in order.<br />\n\"We will work with the user to<br />\nfigure out what kind of refund or<br />\ncredit is due and get that to them<br />\nas soon as possible,\" said Ray.<br />\nBinko noted, \"Unfortunately,<br />\n, charges for that laser printer are<br />\nlumped into the regular printing<br />\ncharges. So, we have no way of<br />\nunraveling<br />\nthe<br />\nactual<br />\novercharges.\"<br />\n<br />\nWhile the problem has been<br />\ncorrected, Binko urged that VAX<br />\n8600 Tex output users continue to<br />\nkeep records of their printouts<br />\nand fees to insure that they are not<br />\nor have not been overcharged.<br />\nAlso, he said, if users are going to be printing Tex output,<br />\nthey should utilize the command<br />\nTEX PRINT, which should insure that the pages are counted<br />\ncorrectly.<br />\nAnother area of concern for<br />\ncomputer facility terminal users<br />\nis the recent moving of the computer room's daily closing from<br />\n4 a.m. to 2 a.m. this semester.<br />\n\"Our main problem is that we<br />\ncannot find enough proctors to<br />\nwork the night shifts,\" explained Binko. \"We're budgeted to be<br />\nopen twenty-four hours a day.<br />\nWe just need people to work the<br />\nlater hours.\"<br />\n<br />\nGET BACK TO YOUR ROOTS<br />\n<br />\nOn Friday, February 19th,<br />\nJohn Waters will turn the<br />\n60s on its ear with a<br />\ncomedy that shows no mercy<br />\n<br />\nmovie by John Wters<br />\n<br />\nHAiR<br />\ngPR<br />\nMI LIR<br />\nWTI MUT V INCIMIAL MIT RN norm -1111.41LIF rems NM MI<br />\nIIVIV MIN \u2022 MIN \u2022 NM Lee \u2022 IJCII Lai us MIS 31111/1,,,,UI.PiAUNIA<br />\nmumnima OM Lit Nem MU=UMW EMI an 3,11.1 OMR MINIM MEM Mitmein INNIS<br />\nmum sr LIM TuALa wino so norm or Am114TILI<br />\n<br />\n(ULTPIA.111T111111111or<br />\n<br />\n*NES,<br />\n<br />\nWA C 1%1%14<br />\now..mon.mmirsimirm<br />\n<br />\n\f6/FEBRUARY 19, 1988<br />\n<br />\nMuller defends tuition hike<br />\nin light of budget problems<br />\n1Pledges sizable rise in student aid budget,<br />\nTUITION, from 1<br />\nwith reference to Robert Welch's<br />\nresignation as dean of<br />\nadministration.<br />\nNoting that Welch's position is<br />\nvery helpful to students because<br />\nthey go to him to address student<br />\nissues, FitzGerald asked, \"With<br />\nthe suggestion that[Welch] not be<br />\nreplaced, but instead that his<br />\nresponsibilities be shifted to the<br />\nacademic deans, will there still be<br />\nthe opportunities for students to<br />\nexpound on their grievances<br />\ntowards things like new dormitory housing and better student<br />\nfacilities?\"<br />\nHe continued, \"Will we be<br />\nable to go to a specific person for<br />\nthese things and will the extra<br />\nmoney that we're paying next<br />\nyear be directed towards these<br />\ngoals?\"<br />\nMuller stated that \"the reasons<br />\nfor [Welch's] leaving do not have<br />\nanything to do with the fiscal<br />\nsituations at the University.\"<br />\nHe added, \"While it is quite<br />\nclear that we need someone to<br />\nplay the role Bob Welch has<br />\nplayed,'' the present administrative hierarchy resulted in<br />\na \"complicated relationship\" between the Homewood deans,<br />\nwhich resulted in \"a great difficulty in clarifying the lines of<br />\nresponsibility.\"<br />\nThe President then deferred to<br />\nLloyd Armstrong, dean of the<br />\nSchool of Arts and Sciences, and<br />\nV.

Emotionally, it is hard<br />\nto accept a $1000 rise in tuition in a<br />\nsingle year.<br />\nWhile University President Steven<br />\nMuller addressed the Student Council<br />\nthis week, he proposed that students<br />\nmust help pay for improving the school.<br />\nThe increase, according to Muller, is<br />\ngoing toward renovation and expansion<br />\nof facilities.<br />\nFielding questions from Council<br />\nmembers, Muller maintained that this<br />\nwas the only cause for the increase. The<br />\nsituation for Homewood, in other<br />\nwords, is status quo. Budget deficits and<br />\nother projects such as the Nanjing<br />\nCenter are not sucking up under-<br />\n<br />\nup, and up<br />\n<br />\ngraduate tuition money.<br />\nOther matters that are in Hopkins<br />\ndirect interest besides improving<br />\nfacilities do lay claim to our money.<br />\nQuite justly, 20 cents on every dollar<br />\nof tuition goes to financial aid. Muller<br />\nacknowledges how important this is,<br />\nand how still more must be done.<br />\nA more natural conclusion than any<br />\nother is that Hopkins is acting with fiscal<br />\nresponsibility; rising costs and maintaining and upgrading the school is costing<br />\neveryone involved more money.<br />\nThe issue of constantly rising tuition<br />\nraises serious concern. If this increase<br />\ncomes in a status quo situation, is a 6%<br />\nannual increase a permanent fixture? If<br />\nso, the future has a somewhat gloomy<br />\ntint for years of students facing<br />\nastronomical bills for higher education;<br />\nit looks still gloomier for universities<br />\nwho will inevitably take cuts in the<br />\ndiversity and quality of the students who<br />\ncan attend them.<br />\n<br />\nA Little Leeway<br />\n<br />\nGratuitous Gunplay<br />\nby A. Lee Davis<br />\nOn my way into Super-Food,<br />\ndown on Greenmount, I glanced<br />\nat the window of a neighboring<br />\nvideo store, and there saw<br />\nsomething I found at once too<br />\nironic to go by unreported. In the<br />\ncorner of the window,just above<br />\nthe sill, was a poster which<br />\ndepicted the business end of a<br />\n.38. Underneath were the words,<br />\n\"If you see a gun, call.\" I'd seen<br />\nthe poster before\u2014in WaWa,outside of 7-11\u2014but I'd never<br />\nglimpsed it in the decidedly incongruous circumstances which<br />\nthen confronted me. Above the<br />\nposter was Charles Bronson, a<br />\n.44 as big as his head jutting from<br />\nhis grip. To the right were Lee<br />\nMarvin and Chuch Norris, submachine guns blazing. To the left<br />\nwas some no-name with a determined grimace and a gleaming<br />\npistol. It was almost funny. If you<br />\nsee a gun . . .<br />\nSkin-flicks and vengeanceoriented films have many things<br />\nin common. They are both easy<br />\nto write, cast, and shoot. They<br />\nboth sacrifice artistic quality for<br />\nmass appeal to questionable emotions. They both bring in big<br />\nbucks for a relatively paltry investment. Much time, and even<br />\nmore money, has been spent investigating how exposure to pornography affects male viewers.<br />\nDoes watching blue movies incite<br />\nmen to commit rape? From what<br />\nI've read, the answer is no.<br />\nHowever, men who were constantly exposed to pornographic<br />\nimages did ossify in one specific<br />\nway. The movies created an attitude of tolerance; brutality<br />\n<br />\ntowards women began to be<br />\noverlooked.<br />\nNow, in most video store,s, a<br />\nfifteen-year-old can't get his<br />\nhands on \"All American Girls in<br />\nHeat,\" but he has his choice of<br />\nthe newest revenge/slasher/shoot<br />\n'em ups. If he has access to a<br />\nVCR and $1.50 to spare, he can<br />\nwatch (in slow motion) a bullet<br />\npierce someone's brain, obliterate<br />\nsomeone's chest, knock someone<br />\nthrough a ten-story window.<br />\nWhile everyone who watches<br />\nthese movies will not go out and<br />\nshoot someone, again, an attitude<br />\nis created in the viewer, a belief<br />\nthat violence is always justified,<br />\nthat for every situation, a gun is<br />\nthe answer.<br />\nIn these films, potency is<br />\nequated with violence. The<br />\ncharacter's very gender is incorportated in his weapon. Who is<br />\nDirty Harry without his Smith &<br />\nWesson? Who is Rambo without<br />\nhis ridiculously phallic 12-inch<br />\nknife? This association is not as<br />\ndangerous to me or my peers as<br />\nit is to young men still in their<br />\nvaguely defined \"formative<br />\nyears.\" According to these<br />\nmovies, to be a man is to blow<br />\naway those who have offended<br />\nyou. Gender identification is that<br />\nsimple.<br />\nI'm particularly concerned<br />\nabout the young men of Baltimore<br />\nCity, whose penchant for<br />\nshooting each other has<br />\nsociologists, religious leaders,<br />\nand community spokesmen<br />\nscreaming for a halt.

Many have hoped he would<br />\nenter this year's presidential race;<br />\nperhaps it is his abstinence which has<br />\nmade him that much more appealing.<br />\nRegradless, Cuomo is likely to provide a most interesting speech for those<br />\nin attendance this May.<br />\nWe commend the speaker committee<br />\nfor their ability to aquire such a widelyrecognized, quality speaker. The committee has to work within stringent<br />\nbudgetary constraints while trying to attract a lucrative speaker. Past commit-<br />\n<br />\ntees, working under similar limitations,<br />\nwere sometimes far less successful.<br />\nEven last year's speaker choice was a<br />\ndubious one. The committee selected<br />\nHoward Cosell\u2014a well-known personality, yes; however, the sportscaster<br />\nseemed to be an unlikely choice, considering the nature of the school. (Or<br />\nperhaps it was his tragic flaw\u2014his<br />\nreference to the John Hopkins<br />\nUniversity\u2014which left everyone with a<br />\nsour taste in their mouths.)<br />\nMario Cuomo, on the other hand, has<br />\na popular appeal which is enhanced by<br />\nhis intellectual ability. In this election<br />\nyear, his presence will be that much<br />\nmore timely.<br />\nThe Graduation Speaker Committee<br />\ndeserves a special thanks for their efforts; this year's Commencement will<br />\nsurely be a memorable one.<br />\n<br />\nBrad Handler, Elizabeth Harrigan<br />\nEditors<br />\nFlory Ware<br />\nBusiness Manager<br />\nGlen Weiss<br />\nManaging Editor<br />\nAnn Ginsberg, Diana Zeiger<br />\nProduction Managers<br />\nEly Brown<br />\nLayout Editor<br />\nKathleen McCarthy, Jonathan Stempel<br />\nNews Editors<br />\nPhil Gochenour, Mark W.

But I would<br />\nlike to call to the attention of the<br />\nNews-Letter's readership two<br />\ntelephone calls I received the day<br />\nof that issue's publication.<br />\nMy comic strip for that issue<br />\nfocused three of its four panels on<br />\nthe completely and obviously fictitious conversation between the<br />\ntwo Editors-in-Chief of the NewsLetter, Elizabeth Harrigan and<br />\nBrad Handler. As the strip went,<br />\nBrad wondered increduously how<br />\nLiz could include the condoms in<br />\nthat week's News-Letter without<br />\nfirst checking with any administration officials, particularly Dean of Students Chris Colombo. Liz replied that Brad was<br />\noverreacting: \"You never know<br />\nwhat [Dean Colombo's] reaction<br />\nmight be . . .\"The fourth panel of<br />\nthe strip featured an impressive<br />\ndesktop and accompanying chair,<br />\nobviously Dean Colombo's office, and an anonymous thoughtballoon, obviously the Snoopyesque \"unattributed\" words of<br />\nDean Colombo himself: \"Whoa?<br />\nWhat's this. . . A condom\u2014.. .<br />\nMmm . . .Goucher, here I<br />\ncome!\"<br />\nWell, that Friday afternoon, I<br />\nreceived a telephone call from a<br />\ngirl who identified herself as a<br />\nGoucher student. She asked me to<br />\n\"explain\" my strip, as she<br />\n\"didn't see any humor in it at<br />\nall.\" I explained that I'd be pleased to do so, but that first she<br />\nwould have to tell me what she<br />\nsupposed I meant by the strip; had<br />\nshe any clue at all? \"You can't<br />\neven construct a simple<br />\nhypothesis as to what it might<br />\nmean?\" My caller admitted that<br />\nthis was indeed a task beyond her<br />\ncapabilities.<br />\nI explained the humor in the<br />\ncartoon (despite my conviction<br />\nthat analysis kills humor), by trying to convey the incongruity of<br />\nan administration official: A)not<br />\nbeing told beforehand about<br />\nsomething like putting condoms<br />\nin the school newspaper; B) not<br />\nminding that someone put condoms in the school newspaper;<br />\nand C), actually glad for the fact,<br />\nand ready to take advantage of his<br />\ngood fortune by chasing collegeaged girls at a traditional nearby<br />\nmixing scene.<br />\n<br />\nJust when 1 thought that she<br />\nwas an inch closer to getting this<br />\nremarkably subtle and complex<br />\njoke, she told me that the cartoon<br />\n\"was a sick portrayal of Goucher<br />\nstudents.\" Stung, I responded<br />\nthat no portrayal of any Goucher<br />\nstudent actually appeared in the<br />\ncartoon\u2014only one man's obviously facetious perception of<br />\nGoucher, for his chances for<br />\n\"scoring\" there were actually<br />\nportrayed. After awhile, I thanked her for her time and<br />\ninitiative\u2014after all, I am always<br />\neager to hear any comments about<br />\n\"With Eyes Closed\"\u2014and hung<br />\nup.<br />\nNot more than three minutes<br />\nlater, I received a call from<br />\nanother girl, who also identified<br />\nherself as a Goucher student. And<br />\nalthough this new caller dialed<br />\nmy number to complain about the<br />\nstrip only seconds after the first<br />\nGoucher student, she claimed not<br />\nto know her predecessor. Fancy<br />\nthat! No calls on a strip for nearly two years, and then two<br />\nstrangers call to complain about<br />\nthe same strip within minutes of<br />\none another! I must remember to<br />\nget in touch with Ripley's.<br />\nAnyway, the second caller raised similar objections, and<br />\ndemanded an apology, which she<br />\nclaimed was something more than<br />\na few Goucher students wanted<br />\nfrom me. (And, although I was<br />\nlater told by a friend that several<br />\nangry letters were on their way,<br />\nthe News-Letter has to date not<br />\nreceived any.) \"All humor is at<br />\nsomeone's expense,\" I told her.<br />\nShe begged to differ with that, but<br />\nstopped doing so once I told her<br />\nthat that was a quotation from<br />\nGroucho Marx, who I presumed<br />\nknew more about humor than<br />\neither one of us. I then also explained that I failed to see how a<br />\nGoucher student could construe<br />\nthe humor of this cartoon as being at Goucher College's<br />\nexpense.<br />\nThe real point here is that my<br />\nstrip was wholly inoffensive, and,<br />\nas such, I can't really see<br />\napologizing to anyone, least of all<br />\nGoucher students, who were not<br />\neven satirized in any way. My second caller said that any school's<br />\nname could have gone in place of<br />\nGoucher's, and I reminded her<br />\nthat Goucher has historically been<br />\nlinked to Johns Hopkins,<br />\nespecially as a social scene for<br />\nmales, since the female-male<br />\n<br />\nratio at Goucher exceeds our<br />\nown. To whom is this not an accepted fact? She went on to argue<br />\nthat I was helping to perpetuate<br />\na myth of Goucherian promiscuity, and I told her that in actuality, the strip gave no indication as<br />\nto the likelihood of Dean Colombo's chances at using the condom<br />\nat Goucher.<br />\nAs an aside, it seems worth<br />\nnoting that even if! had satirized<br />\nGoucher in some way, I don't<br />\nthink that anyone who reads the<br />\ncomic strip would really believe<br />\nthat they were receiving reliable,<br />\nfactual and unexaggerated information from the strip. They read<br />\nthe articles for that. I view my<br />\ntiny little assignment as a chance<br />\nto maybe throw some light on<br />\ncertain things by taking real-life<br />\nevents to a new level of absurdity, a point from which we might<br />\nbe able to see those events with<br />\na little more irony or wistfulness.<br />\nI do not now consider Goucher<br />\ngirls promiscuous, nor have I<br />\never, for reasons even beside my<br />\nown experiences with them. I<br />\nhave only the deepest respect for<br />\nGoucher as an academic institution, and for the people who attend Goucher. Nor was my cartoon meant to convey any sentiments to the contrary. Usually<br />\nmy cartoon is structured so<br />\nsimplistically that it's almost impossible to have difficulty discerning any satiric victims. I don't<br />\nthink this cartoon represented a<br />\nsignificant departure.<br />\nIn closing I wish to invoke the<br />\nBeatles lyric from which the comic strip's name was taken: \"Living is easy with eyes closed/<br />\nMisunderstanding all you<br />\nsee... .\"Open your eyes, ladies,<br />\nand maybe you'll start to understand the comic strips you read<br />\ntogether.<br />\n<br />\nThe namesfrom the preceding account were purposefully deleted.<br />\nIncidentally, James Rosen felt<br />\nthat the names ofthe participants<br />\nshould have been included.

My anger was not<br />\nantecedent to the film, waiting to<br />\nbe drawn out; it was provoked by<br />\nit. In \"real-life\" my anger never<br />\nexisted.

His knowledge<br />\nof baseball is excellent, and the<br />\ncolumn spiced up a flat Sports<br />\nsection.

Your writing is<br />\nfine; it's the timing that is bad.<br />\nGreg Bronsvag<br />\n<br />\nInvolvement in Honor<br />\nTo the Editor:<br />\nSeveral weeks ago, the Student<br />\nCouncil formed an ad hoc committee to investigate the possibility of reintroducing an honor<br />\nsystem to Hopkins. As a member<br />\nof this committee, lam writing to<br />\nurge students to become actively<br />\ninvolved in this committee and its<br />\nfunctions.<br />\nStudent involvement will make<br />\nor break any honor system.<br />\nThis fact has already been<br />\n<br />\nclearly seen here at Hopkins.<br />\nBoth the old honor system's abandonment in the mid 1970's and<br />\nthe ineffectiveness of the present<br />\nethics system can be attributed to<br />\nlow student participation. From<br />\nour experiences at Hopkins, we<br />\nknow that any honor system that<br />\nis introduced here must have the<br />\nfull support of the student body<br />\nin order to be effective.<br />\nThis committee is presently<br />\nconsidering instituting an entirely student-run honor system<br />\nsimilar to those at Princeton and<br />\nthe University of Virginia.<br />\nSeveral details of the proposed<br />\nsystem are disclosed in the adjoining letters. Hopefully, the<br />\ncharacteristics of this system will<br />\nencourage students to take an active role in upholding academic<br />\nhonor at Hopkins.<br />\nDetails of the proposal aside,<br />\nthe fact remains that Hopkins<br />\nstudents must make a conscious<br />\neffort to be active in the development and maintenance of such a<br />\nsystem. I urge interested students<br />\nto become involved with this<br />\ncommittee. I also urge every student to talk amongst their friends<br />\nabout this idea and about what<br />\nhonor means to a University community. If Hopkins students are<br />\never to enjoy the benefits of a<br />\nstudent-run honor system, they<br />\nmust be active in its implementation now.<br />\n<br />\nHC Feasibility<br />\nTo the Editor:<br />\n<br />\nMany questions emerge as we<br />\ndiscuss a viable alternative to the<br />\ncurrent ethics code. One issue<br />\nwith which we are grappling is<br />\nhow to inject an honor code into<br />\nthe current climate. Most people<br />\nconsider the honor code a good<br />\nand noble idea, if only we lived<br />\nin an ideal world.<br />\nI agree; it is simply unrealistic<br />\nto consider such an option.<br />\nHopkins may not be ideal, but<br />\nover time, I believe we can<br />\ndevelop an honor code which<br />\nmay be phased in over a period<br />\nof several years. The Admissions<br />\nprocess and Orientation program<br />\ncan inculcate a sensitivity to and<br />\npride in an honor code from the<br />\n'beginning.<br />\nFirst, we need to introduce applicants to the honor code in the<br />\nadmissions process, establishing<br />\nan awareness of the issue prior to<br />\ntheir arrival at Hopkins. From<br />\nthere, it can be continued in the<br />\nOrientation program. Orientation<br />\noffers an opportune time to introduce students to the Hopkins<br />\nethics policy. Ethics could be a<br />\nfocal point in the speeches and<br />\ntours to which freshmen are subjected to upon their arrival.<br />\nDiscussions of what it is, of the<br />\nresponsibilities inherent in it, of<br />\nDavid Hannan the benefits derived, and of why<br />\n<br />\nit developed are placed easily<br />\namong the programs. Student Advising and Housemaster training<br />\naffords another captive audience.<br />\nAs the creators of first impressions, we can establish a tone<br />\nconducive to an honor code.<br />\nWe have discussed a program<br />\nwith features to be added and<br />\nchanged with each incoming<br />\nclass, and as awareness and<br />\nresponsibility grow in the community. Feasibility must be<br />\nweighed in all these considerations. Ultimately, in four to five<br />\nyears we would like to see selfscheduled, unproctored exams.<br />\nHowever, we need to give the<br />\ncommunity time to adjust to the<br />\nnew program, and to develop a<br />\nsense of pride in the system. Most<br />\npeople concede that the current<br />\nsystem does not really work. We<br />\nneed suggestions and concerns<br />\nfrom the entire student body.<br />\nHopkins students deserve better<br />\nthan the current system. A wellthought out, phased program<br />\nevaluated annually just might<br />\nwork.<br />\nWhat have we got to lose?<br />\nLora Sims<br />\n<br />\nHC: Improving Climate<br />\nTo the Editor:<br />\nWhen the Human Climate Task<br />\nForce issued its report this fall,<br />\none of the concerns addressed<br />\n<br />\nUNIVERSITY TRAVEL<br />\n<br />\nTS<br />\nLIS<br />\nCIA<br />\nSPERIGHT<br />\nINyoultmcgorARTY<br />\n'WE'RE<br />\n<br />\nTHE TRAVEL<br />\nCONNECTION<br />\n<br />\n\u2022:=CD<br />\n<br />\n467-9300<br />\n<br />\n\u00e7cz<br />\n<br />\nCONVENIENTLY LOCATED IN THE ROTUNDA MALL,<br />\nUP THE IiAMP FROM THE GIANT<br />\nHOPKINS SHUTTLE OR JUST CALL<br />\nTHE<br />\nTAKE<br />\n<br />\nwas the atmosphere among<br />\nstudents. Tension, lack of trust,<br />\nand cutthroat competition all contribute to a feeling of unease and<br />\nintensity that is counterproductive. Students go away to college<br />\nnot only to study, but to learn<br />\nhow to cope with real life, how<br />\nto rely on each other for<br />\nassistance, and to develop faith in<br />\ntheir peers.<br />\nIt has been said that a student<br />\ncan learn as much from a twohour discussion with a friend late<br />\nat night in the dorms as she can<br />\nin three weeks worth of lectures.<br />\nThis is true not only because we<br />\ncan learn from others' ex-,<br />\nperiences, but because such<br />\ndiscussion helps clarify our own<br />\nvalues while instilling a tolerance<br />\nfor other opinions. Unfortunately, because of the intensely<br />\nsingle-minded academic atmosphere-at Hopkins, there is little opportunity to foster such contact and maturity.<br />\nInstead, at Hopkins students are<br />\nwary of one another, the competition for \"the edge\" squeezing out<br />\nmuch of the comraderie that is<br />\npresent at other undergraduate<br />\nschools and even professional<br />\nschools and which usually tends<br />\nto cement bonds of fellowship and<br />\ngoodwill.<br />\nThere is very little sense of<br />\n\"we are all in this together,\" but<br />\ninstead competition is carried to<br />\nsuch an extreme that it is the end<br />\npurpose; the goal is not<br />\nknowledge or learning, but who<br />\ncan score the highest on a given<br />\nexam or in a particular class.

Gitlitz<br />\n<br />\nHC: Promoting Values<br />\nTo the Editor:<br />\nI have, on prior occasions, used this forum to charaterize the<br />\ncampus environment here as \"oppressive and stifling\" and to lament the \"insane quest for GPA<br />\npoints\" which seems to be the<br />\nprimary activity of every Hopkins<br />\nstudent. On this occasion, I wish<br />\nto utilize this forum to discuss a<br />\nway in which we can effect a fundamental change in the nature of<br />\nour school and thereby render my<br />\nprevious observations invalid.<br />\nThe way is to reestablish an<br />\nHonor Code at Hopkins. An active Honor Code would effectively control one key phenomenon<br />\nthat is a complete anathema to the<br />\nbuilding of a true campus community: cutthroat competition.<br />\nCertain students at Hopkins,<br />\nseeking to compete with their<br />\nclassmates for academic honors<br />\nand prestige, utilize methods to<br />\nimprove their standing in this ,<br />\ncompetition which are in direct<br />\nviolation with the standards of the<br />\nUniversity and of common<br />\nhuman decency. The paranoia<br />\nthat is created by this contest<br />\nfosters distrust among the<br />\nstudents. Unity can never be<br />\nachieved in this environment.<br />\nIn this day and age when<br />\nacademic excellence is so highly<br />\nprized, and thus, so richly<br />\nrewarded, we have lost sight of<br />\nthe basic mission of this school:<br />\nto educate its students. We are not<br />\nhere to compete against one<br />\nanother, but against ourselves, to<br />\nachieve our own individual levels<br />\nof excellence. We the students,<br />\nwith common bonds and common<br />\nbelieves, are all here together to<br />\nbetter ourselves. Why must we<br />\nconsistently tear ourselves apart<br />\nover the drive to become #1?<br />\nThe reinstitution of an Honor<br />\nCode at Hopkins will cause us to<br />\nremember many of the basic<br />\nvalues we learned as children:<br />\n<br />\nresponsibility, trust, sharing and<br />\nhonor. At the same time, it will<br />\ncause us to recall those actions<br />\nwhich we have always considered<br />\nto.be wrong: lying, stealing and<br />\ncheating. Once we finally<br />\nrecognize the lunacy of our present endeavors, and move to<br />\nreinstitute an Honor Code, all of<br />\nus will benefit, if not from a<br />\nmarked improvement in the<br />\nqualitiy of life, then certainly<br />\nfrom a marked improvement in<br />\nthe clarity of our consciences.<br />\n<br />\nIf you would like to get involved or have questions, please call<br />\nme at 889-5145.<br />\nTy Hyderally<br />\n<br />\nHC and Integrity<br />\nTo the Editor:<br />\nWhy are we as students tempted to cheat?

Knowing that<br />\nanyone could turn you in would<br />\nprevent many of the ethics violations that take place. We would<br />\nhave an environment where<br />\nstudents would avoid cheating in<br />\nfront of other students, and<br />\nrealistically how often does someone cheat without anyone else<br />\nknowing about it?<br />\nPresenting the anonymity issue,<br />\nthe question of false accusations<br />\narises. This requirement that the<br />\ncase be proven on material<br />\nevidence should prevent false accusations. Additionally, the<br />\nPrinceton code states that lying<br />\nbefore the committee is a violation of the code. This too should<br />\ndeter false accusations.<br />\nA final argument against an<br />\nhonor code is that it would create<br />\nanimosity between students. I<br />\nargue that this will instead create<br />\na sense of responsibility among<br />\nstudents that we at Hopkins sorely<br />\nlack. It should be our responibility to enforce our ethical standards. The students in a class are<br />\nhurt by cheating, so it should be<br />\nthe students who prevent it, rather<br />\nthan relying on a professor to enforce an ethical standard.<br />\nLETTERS, from 13<br />\n<br />\nminority.

I<br />\nhasten to add that in the West<br />\nBank and Gaza under Arab rule<br />\nthe average income was $100 per<br />\nannum while under the Israelis it<br />\nrose to $1000. Perhaps, conditions are not as they should be<br />\nyet; but Israel is making an effort<br />\nthat the Arab states never made.<br />\nRather, the Arab states have been<br />\nthe worst enemies of the Palestinians. From 1948-1967, Egypt<br />\nmade no effort to create a Palestinian state in Gaza; nor did Jordan from 1950-1967 when they<br />\n<br />\nhas led a search for Arab leaders<br />\nable and willing to negotiate. Only Sadat has made the step while\"<br />\nthe other Arab leaders have rejected negotiations and challenged Israel's right to exist.<br />\nHarrell speaks with seeming<br />\nsupport for the PLO and questions why Israel does not<br />\nnegotiate with them. The PLO is<br />\nnot a nation, but rather an extreme fringe of terrorists. Arafat<br />\nspeaking on radio Amman has<br />\ncalled for stronger riots in the territories and for violence to start<br />\nwithin Israel proper. Arafat's<br />\nclaim is as it always was: the<br />\nliberation of all of Palestine (pre<br />\n1967 included) by armed struggle. Arafat never mentions compromise or negotiations.<br />\nWhen Israel has attempted<br />\nnegotiations with responsible<br />\nPalestinian leaders, the PLO frequently intervened.

He was<br />\nassasinated by the PLO and so<br />\nwere many others like him.<br />\nHence, local moderates are intimidated from voicing their willingness to talk to Israel.<br />\nHarrell asks for an explanation<br />\nof the detention of Hanna Siniora<br />\nand of efforts to deport Mubarek<br />\nAwad. Both men have intimate<br />\nties to the PLO. If Harrell did his<br />\nhomework he would see that<br />\nAwad has been very involved<br />\nwith armed struggle and preaches<br />\nnon-violent action only in addition to very violent action.<br />\nHowever, I would assume that<br />\nthat fact held no use for Harrell.<br />\nPaul Diamond<br />\n<br />\nArab\u2014Israeli Conflict<br />\nTo the Editor:<br />\nAssuming that all that the supporters of the Israeli idea hold<br />\nagainst Arabs is true, does that<br />\nwin the case for Israel, for, clearly, we acquiesce to all of its proponent attacks?<br />\nWe do not think so, and for the<br />\nmain reason: we believe that what<br />\nshould preoccupy the interested<br />\nobserver is not so much the past<br />\nArab-Israeli behaviour as the<br />\nquestion of Israel, or rather Israel<br />\nand its legitimacy as a question.<br />\nFor assuming we do prove the il-<br />\n<br />\nlegitimacy of Israel, does not that<br />\nwin the case against Israel and,<br />\nfrom this point of view, settle the<br />\nwhole Arab-Israeli issue?<br />\nAnd for us, legitimacy is established by demonstrated land<br />\nproprietorship and not devious<br />\nnotions of biblical rights. For the<br />\nsake of our argument, consider<br />\nthis: In the 1920's the Jewish<br />\ncommunity consisted of 10 percent of the total population that<br />\ninhabited the region that we shall<br />\ncall, for historical reasons,<br />\nPalestine. By the late 1940's that<br />\ncommunity grew to form 30 percent of the total, an increase<br />\nmostly due to immigration of<br />\nJewish war survivors. In 1948,<br />\nthe community, half of which<br />\nconsisted of recent immigrants<br />\nwho could not have lived in<br />\nPalestine for more than five<br />\nyears, claimed 56 percent of the<br />\nPalestinian territory for the creation of the Israeli state.<br />\nToday, after two additional<br />\nwars, the Jewish comunity, expanded by subsequent incomers<br />\nfrom the rest of the world, controls the whole of Palestine. Now,<br />\nthe lands seized since 1948 have<br />\nbeen victory fruits of wars that,<br />\nwe will admit, the Arabs provoked. Consequently, if the 1948<br />\nIsraeli state proves to be<br />\nlegitimate, that is if the Jewish<br />\ncommunity behind its creation did<br />\nown every square inch of the land<br />\nit claimed for its statehood, then<br />\nIsrael had the right to exist in<br />\n1948, the subsequent Arab at-<br />\n<br />\ntacks were unwarranted, the further occupation of Arab territories is a consequence of<br />\nwrongdoings that must be accepted and, finally, today's Israeli<br />\npolicies in the occupied territories<br />\ndefensive<br />\nare justifiable<br />\nmeasures. But if, on the other<br />\nhand, it is not the case that 20 percent of the population (an extremely generous figure; 10 percent for the original Jewish inhabitants and 10 percent more for<br />\nhalf of the subsequent immigrants<br />\nwho did actually purchase land)<br />\nshould have owned 56 percent of<br />\nthe territory, then Israel could not<br />\nhave come about without illegtimate and therefore forceful<br />\nland appropriations at the expense<br />\nof native populations, and, furthermore, the present measures in<br />\nthe occupied territories are acts<br />\nthat aim at the preservation of a<br />\nstate which is fundamentally illegitimate. In that case, we can<br />\nnot speak of Israel's right to exist before that right is at least legal<br />\nand legitimate. But do not<br />\nmisunderstand us: we are not<br />\nclaiming the contested lands actually belonged to Arabs, nor that<br />\nthey were part of a Palestinian<br />\nstate; it is quite all right that the<br />\nlands should belong to no one; let<br />\nthem be for everyone's use but let<br />\nno one unjustifiably appropriate<br />\nthem. So, above all, do not<br />\nmistake us for what we aren't; we<br />\nsimply hold the view that Israel<br />\nis illegitimate and we do so<br />\nbecause many of us were victims<br />\n<br />\nof such illegitimacy and had to<br />\nlose their land to provide for someone else's house. In the ArabIsraeli conflict we should be<br />\npreoccupied more by justice than<br />\nanything else, especially an unjust<br />\npeace.<br />\nNehme Ayoub<br />\n<br />\nJustifying Absurdity<br />\nTo the Editor:<br />\nReading the last issue of the<br />\nNews-Letter one cannot help but<br />\nsmile at the absurdity of some of<br />\nthe letters to the editor. The absurdity is not the attempted<br />\njustification of the barbaric<br />\nmeasures taken by the Israelis<br />\nagains unarmed, civilian<br />\ndemonstrators. There really is no<br />\nneed for justifying such actions<br />\nbecause anyone who has closely<br />\nmonitoried the conflict would<br />\nhave anticipated the Israelis to<br />\ntake precisely these measures.<br />\nThe absurdity lies in the<br />\nunderlying attempts at justifying<br />\nIsrael's land claims. Indeed by<br />\nreferring to the ocupied territories<br />\nas Judea and Samaia, the Israelis<br />\nand their apologists are reminding<br />\nus of the Biblical claims of the<br />\nJews over these lands. I still cannot believe how, at the dawn of<br />\nthe 21st century, some ostensibly<br />\nrational people are justifying<br />\npolitical and military actions by<br />\nthe alleged land claims of what<br />\ncan be viewed as a 6000 year-old<br />\n<br />\ntribal god.<br />\nIf we must regress ourselves to<br />\nthe maturity of 4000 B.C.E.<br />\npolitics, I feel compelled to present the land claims of my own<br />\npeople. Baal, the god of my<br />\nPhoenician ancestors, tells us that<br />\nwe are his chosen people. In fact,<br />\nPhoenicia (today's Lebanon extended north to Tartous in Syria<br />\nand south to Jaffa) is our divine<br />\nright. Baal, as a matter of fact,<br />\nmade his revelations to the<br />\nPhoenician before Yahweh made<br />\nhis revelations to Moses. First<br />\ncome, first served: Northern<br />\nIsrael belongs to Lebanon.<br />\nAs a curiosity, I must point out<br />\nthat Israel was 'originally<br />\ninhabited by the Philistines (hence<br />\nPalestine) who the Hebrew tribes,<br />\nafter escaping the tyranny of the<br />\nPharoah, massacred and then<br />\nturned the survivors into slaves.<br />\nIt is a marvel how history has the<br />\npropensity to repeat itself.<br />\nWhile I do not expect Israeli<br />\npolitics to move to the 20th century overnight, I hope that they<br />\nwill soon move to 500 B.C.E. to<br />\nbegin learning about democracy<br />\nfrom the Athenians.<br />\nThis is not an attack against<br />\nJews or Judaism.

Remember the lack<br />\nof a reading period, the buildup<br />\nof papers and exams within the<br />\nspace of a few days, and if you<br />\nwere particularly unlucky, exams<br />\nlasting until December 23?<br />\nSophomore Gregory Francis<br />\ndescribed the period as \"ruinous,<br />\nsimply ruinous.\" Francis, a<br />\npolitical science major, felt extremely pressured because he had<br />\nseveral upper-level humanities<br />\ncourses which each required \"a<br />\nlarge final paper as well as a final<br />\nexam.\"<br />\nAssociate Dean and Director of<br />\nAcademic Advising Martha A.<br />\nRoseman noted that some<br />\nstudents grades \"went down as a<br />\nresult\" of last semester's finals<br />\nschedule.<br />\nDue to these and other problems, changes are being pro<br />\nposed in the final exam system.<br />\nA draft proposal to correct the<br />\nsituation has been presented to the<br />\nCommittee on Undergraduate<br />\nStudies(CUS)by Associate Dean<br />\nof the School of Arts and<br />\nSciences P. Kyle McCarter.<br />\nRoseman said that the administration \"was trying to accomodate students' concerns.\"<br />\nDean of Administration Robert<br />\nWelch acknowledged several major problems that were faced by<br />\nstudents at the end of last<br />\nsemester: the loss of a reading<br />\nperiod (and requisite loss of study<br />\ntime); the finals schedule not being distributed until November 9,<br />\nmaking it too late for some<br />\nstudents to get discount or in<br />\nsome cases even regular flights<br />\nhome in time for Christmas or<br />\nChanukkah; and the closing of the<br />\ndorms on December 23\u2014the last<br />\nday of exams\u2014leaving some<br />\nstudents with nowhere to stay if<br />\ntheir flights were on the 24th.<br />\nRegistrar Robert Cyphers listed<br />\nseveral factors causing these<br />\n<br />\nproblems:<br />\n\u2022 According to a decision made<br />\nby Student Council 5 years ago,<br />\nthe fall semester will not start until the Thursday after Labor Day.<br />\nThere are between 105 to 111<br />\ndays between Labor Day and<br />\nChristmas Eve. This year had 105<br />\ndays, allowing no room for a<br />\nreading period. Under this present system, next year there will<br />\nbe a reading period of one day.<br />\n\u2022 The decision tq include a Fall<br />\nBreak of one day into the calendar pushed the finals period a day<br />\ncloser to Christmas Eve.<br />\n\u2022The actual eight-day final exam period further crammed the<br />\nschedule. Until the academic year<br />\n1986-87, there was a ten-day final<br />\nexam period and no Fall Break.<br />\nThe present final exam system<br />\nschedules exams in groups.<br />\nGroups are composed of classes<br />\nmeeting at the same times and of<br />\nsequential subject matter. For example, in one group there might<br />\nbe the mathematics sequence of<br />\nPre-Calculus through Calculus<br />\nIV; in another sequence, intro<br />\nand upper-level chemistry<br />\ncourses.<br />\nAccording to Cyphers, there<br />\nare 18 groups based purely on the<br />\ntime of the first meeting day of<br />\nclass. With an exam period of 16<br />\nexam times (2 per day), some<br />\ni groups had to be combined.<br />\nThe class time schedule is not<br />\nabsolute. Some small seminar<br />\nclasses which change meeting<br />\ntimes do not follow this pattern.<br />\nAlso, the registrar's office tries<br />\nto accommodate faculty requests<br />\nto change exam days and times.<br />\nCyphers noted that another factor which was considered was<br />\nseparating large, predominantly<br />\nfreshman class exams by one day.<br />\nAs for why the finals schedule<br />\ndid not come out until November,<br />\nthe Registrar explained that the<br />\nschedule could not be made up<br />\nuntil enrollment had stabilized.<br />\nHopkins schedules exams by<br />\n<br />\nFile Photo<br />\n<br />\nAssociate Dean and Director of Academic Advising Martha A. Roseman\u2014\"trying to accomodate student concerns.\"<br />\n<br />\nhand. Cyphers said that Hopkins<br />\ntried scheduling by computer but<br />\nbelieves hand scheduling works<br />\nbetter. He believes the process<br />\n\"is more of an art than a science\"<br />\nand is subject to personal judgement to resolve various conflicts.<br />\nWhat changes are being proposed to improve the finals<br />\n.scheduling process? According to<br />\nMcCarter's draft proposal, which<br />\n'came out of a meeting of the<br />\nHomewood Deans, the finals<br />\nschedule would be published<br />\nwhen students were scheduling<br />\ntheir classes for the semester.<br />\nThis would allow them to choose<br />\nclasses with the consideration of<br />\nwhen finals were going to occur.<br />\nIn addition, the scheduling of<br />\nfinal exams would be based on<br />\nthe first meeting time of the week<br />\nfor a class.<br />\nAt that meeting, students on the<br />\nCUS suggested changes in this<br />\n<br />\nproposal. One problem cited was<br />\naccommodating faculty who<br />\nwanted to give exams outside this<br />\nfixed period.<br />\nRoseman said that the idea<br />\nbehind this proposal was to allow<br />\nstudents and faculty \"to know in<br />\nadvance when the exams were<br />\ngoing to be,\" if conflicts arose.<br />\nCUS member Jeff De Cagna<br />\nbelieves that the proposal is a<br />\n\"good schedule because it provides students with flexibility. . . and time to work out<br />\nscheduling conflicts.\" De Cagna<br />\nadded that it would also allow<br />\nmore flexibility in making travel<br />\nplans.<br />\nAs for solutions to the dormitory problems faced by<br />\nfreshmen, Welch explained that<br />\nthere was a security problem<br />\nwhen few students are left in the<br />\ndorms. The numbers of students<br />\nprovide security, but when there<br />\nare only a few students scattered<br />\nthroughout the dorms, it is much<br />\nharder to make sure that they are<br />\nsafe. Assistant Director of Housing Tracey Angel said that it was<br />\n<br />\nin the housing contract to close<br />\nthe dorms on the last day of<br />\nfinals; however, if a significant<br />\nnumber of students had problems,<br />\nthe university would try to accomodate them.<br />\nAccording to Welch, any student who could not leave by the<br />\nnight of the 23rd, when the dorms<br />\nclosed, should have received<br />\novernight housing from the<br />\nuniversity. Angel said that threefreshmen asked for and received<br />\nuniversity guest rooms.<br />\nHowever, freshman Paul<br />\nRobinson was told by a Housing<br />\nOffice receptionist that \"there<br />\nwasn't anything available.\"<br />\nWhen he told her that he knew of<br />\nanother student who had received housing, the receptionist<br />\n\"basically told me it was too<br />\nlate.\"<br />\n\"If that was the case,\" said<br />\nWelch, commenting on the above<br />\nsituation, \"then it was an unfortunate case of misinformation on<br />\nthe part of the University<br />\nemployee. lam not aware of any<br />\ndeadline.<br />\n<br />\nHow other schools<br />\nschedule finals<br />\nOther universities face<br />\nsimilar concerns when scheduling finals.

Hopkins students are<br />\nculturally retarded. What other<br />\nconclusion could be drawn from<br />\nthe fact that the full-house audience at The Beaux Arts Trio's<br />\nconcert in Shriver Saturday night<br />\ncontained only a handful of<br />\nstudents.<br />\nThe concert was part of the<br />\n<br />\nShriver Hall Concert Series. The<br />\nseries has been attracting major<br />\nclassical performers since 1966.<br />\nSo why doesn't it attract more<br />\nstudents?<br />\nMoney, you say? Wrong you<br />\nare. While tickets for the general<br />\npopulation are eleven dollars, student tickets are only five. This is<br />\ncheaper than a night at the<br />\nmovies.<br />\nPoor publicity, you say?<br />\n<br />\nWrong you are. The posters have<br />\nbeen up advertising the concert<br />\nfor days. They even hit the dorm<br />\nbulletin boards.<br />\nBetter things to do, you say?<br />\nNot bloody likely. This is<br />\nHopkins. There aren't too many<br />\nthings going on on campus these<br />\ndays. This concert series is one<br />\nof the few impressive things<br />\nHopkins offers.<br />\nSo O.K., you say.

What<br />\nmakes it different now is that instead of using other records simply as references or breaks, D.J.'s<br />\nare using records as the entire<br />\nbody of the song, adding only<br />\ndrums and bassline to distinguish<br />\ntheir song from another. The<br />\nD.J.'s art, then, is to cut and mix<br />\nthese other records into a collage<br />\nthat keeps the people's interest<br />\n(i.e. keep them dancing.)<br />\nIt's a competitive field. What<br />\nis fresh one week is nowhere the<br />\nnext.(Seems like every time you<br />\nturn around Warhol's 15 minutes<br />\nhas been compressed a little<br />\nmore.) New 12\" dance singles<br />\nare put out, and almost before they<br />\nreach the shops, some enterprising D.J. cuts up a piece of it and<br />\nputs it on his own record, which<br />\nin turn gets used in someone<br />\nelse's record. The cycle continues, accelerating with every<br />\nturn.<br />\nPart of what is causing this<br />\nspeed up is the advent of cheap ;<br />\ndigital samplers\u2014machines that<br />\ncan record a sound and play it<br />\nback with computer controlled<br />\naccuracy. Such devices are<br />\ngodsends to the D.J.'s but<br />\nnightmares for producers. In effect, they allow the D.J.'s to control the context of the music.

I usually do not sit down<br />\nand just listen to a string quartet<br />\nwithout otherwise occupying<br />\nmyself.<br />\nPlus, I only have about six<br />\nclassical albums.

I<br />\nsometimes feel like I, in my vast<br />\nignorance of musical technique<br />\nand theory, get more out of these<br />\nconcerts than the more seasoned<br />\nlisteners. I am able to surrender<br />\ncompletely to the music without<br />\ngetting hung up on missed notes<br />\nor gauging degrees of tonal<br />\nquality.<br />\nSo you see, there is something<br />\nto be gained by going to these<br />\nconcerts. They are enjoyable.<br />\nThey are an escape.

For those who have not<br />\nyet had the pleasure, this is the<br />\nalbum for you. Hedges plays a<br />\nwide range of his songs, instrumentals and vocal numbers, as<br />\nwell as a few rather interesting<br />\ncovers. He is not what you call<br />\n\"your average guitar player.\"<br />\nHis innovative techniques involve<br />\nslapping and pounding the guitar<br />\nand an adrenalized punk-rock<br />\nthrasher. Highlights include the<br />\npoignant \"Woman of the<br />\nWorld,\" \"Silent Anticipations\"<br />\nand an extremely funky cover of<br />\nSheila E.'s hit, \"A Love<br />\nBizarre.\"<br />\nI could go on trying to convince<br />\nyou how great this music is. I fear<br />\nI may not have done it justice.<br />\nWorse, I fear I may have<br />\noverstepped my role as critic and<br />\nentered into the realm of the<br />\nfanatic. That's all right, as long<br />\nas the greater interest is served.<br />\nAnd this music is definitely the<br />\ngreater interest.<br />\n<br />\nbeing distributed by Warner'<br />\nBrothers, or simply because he<br />\nran out of ideas.

The leader of the<br />\nmovement is a guy named Dap,<br />\nand he suitably cajoles the attendant students into realizing the<br />\nneed for action.

Both writers take<br />\na spectator's viewpoint on their<br />\nsubjects: Boswell on baseball,<br />\nWill on politics.<br />\nWill's appeal to the educated<br />\nmasses rests on this sort of<br />\nwriting. Will does not claim any<br />\ninsider's right to Truth, yet he is<br />\ncapable of discussing a complex<br />\nissue, presidential politics, on a<br />\nlevel which anyone may understand. Will demystifies an often<br />\nmisunderstood issue by extending<br />\nanalogies of sports to politics.<br />\nThat Dizzy Dean, former pitcher<br />\nfor the St. Louis Cardinals,<br />\nshould have anything to say about<br />\nthe way we elect presidents may<br />\nastonish the reader at first, but it<br />\nis with this sort of comparative<br />\nanalysis that Will raises the<br />\n<br />\nGeorge F. Will<br />\nreader's interest in politics.<br />\nLike Boswell, Will believes<br />\nthat the more one knows about the<br />\nvariables of presidential politics<br />\n(or baseball, depending on the<br />\nauthor), one becomes astounded<br />\nby its complexities. It may not<br />\nsurprise, then, that Will called<br />\nstatistician Bill James' revolutionary mathematical observations of baseball statistics \"the<br />\nmost important scientific treatise<br />\nsince Newton's Principia.\"<br />\nWill's fascination with details and<br />\nstastistical analysis is probably<br />\nthe reason for his in-depth,<br />\nsometimes rambling, review of<br />\nvoting percentages in different<br />\ntates. It must be said, however,<br />\ntha Will's numbers are hardly<br />\nobvious, since the media has been<br />\nignorant of them so far.<br />\nWill's analysis of the '88<br />\npresidential race forms the<br />\npremise behind the book. But<br />\neven though Will reviews the<br />\nfacts necessary to understand the<br />\nupcoming election, he does not<br />\noffer a prediction of the outcome.<br />\nAs Will notes, political analysts<br />\nmay make the mistake, for instance, of declaring that the candidate who best imitates Ronald<br />\nReagan's telegenic attributes will<br />\nbe the winner in '88. Will<br />\ndestroys the \"presidents-areactors\" theory, favoring instead<br />\na \"guiding light\" approach. The<br />\nReagan candidacies, both in '80<br />\nand '84, were successful, Will<br />\nsays, because Reagan stressed an<br />\noverriding policy, an emotion,<br />\nwhich the electorate could readily absorb.

Though tremendous<br />\nsacrifices and academic pressures<br />\nare often placed upon the student,<br />\nsuch hardship sometimes is unnecessarily forced upon the individual by himself. In the opinion of Dr. John Gryder, the<br />\nhealth professions adviser and<br />\nprofessor of chemistry, the<br />\naverage Hopkins student worries<br />\ntoo much about gaining entrance<br />\ninto medical school. The national<br />\ntrend toward the medical profession has dropped among college<br />\nstudents, and some of the fears<br />\nassociated with entrance into<br />\nmedicine are unfounded.<br />\nA typical graduating class from<br />\nJHU includes some 150 to 160<br />\napplicants to medical school. In<br />\n1986, from this size group, all but<br />\none student with a grade point<br />\naverage above 3.2 gained acceptance to some school. Even the<br />\none remaining student was an exceptional case, as his stay at<br />\nHopkins had been for only three<br />\nyears and his failure to obtain entrance merely left him the option<br />\nof completing his senior year.<br />\nStudents with a cummulative<br />\nG.P.A. between 3.0 and 3.2<br />\nfound a 3 in 4 chance of entering<br />\nmedical school, and surprisingly,<br />\n58 percent of individuals with<br />\n<br />\nbelow 3.0 were accepted. Obviously, the anxiety over succeeding in the classroom is not<br />\njustified.<br />\nWhat then are the medical<br />\nschools looking for in the student? Dr. Gryder feels that a<br />\ntypical school will first examine<br />\nthe individual's grades and scores<br />\non the Medical College Admissions Test (MCAT). This may<br />\ncount for up to half of the application. It may be noted, however,<br />\nthat two schools, Hopkins and<br />\nRochester, do not require the<br />\nMCAT, but in honesty, neglecting to take these tests may be<br />\nhazardous, unless one assumes he<br />\nwill gain acceptance to such a<br />\nschool. The remaining criteria used to judge a student are recommendations, the interview, and<br />\nactivities.<br />\nextracurricular<br />\nGenerally, a quarter of the application is dependent upon the<br />\nrecommendations and activities,<br />\nand the remaining quarter is left<br />\nto the discretion of the interviewer. A medical institution is,<br />\naccording to Dr. Gryder, \"looking for motivation in a student, a<br />\nstudent who has demonstrated<br />\nconcern for other people,\" and<br />\none who has not \"done things just<br />\nto look good\" but rather has<br />\n\"done things that truly interest<br />\nhim.\" Schools also examine the<br />\nstudent's interaction with other<br />\npeople and seek maturity in an<br />\n<br />\nindividual. Simply put, Dr.<br />\nGryder believes that each interviewer \"has his ideal view of<br />\nwhat a physician should be and<br />\nmatches the student to this ideal.\"<br />\nThough medical schools may<br />\nseek a certain type of individual,<br />\nthere is the common belief that<br />\ncertain fields of undergraduate<br />\nstudy give the student some advantage over his or her peers.<br />\nBiology and chemistry are often<br />\nthought as the traditional premedical backgrounds. Students in<br />\nthese disciplines do tend to enter<br />\nthe medical schools, but again the<br />\nstudent must realize that such<br />\nfields of study are scienceintensive and consequently are<br />\nappropriate and beneficial for the<br />\nfirst two years of medical school.<br />\nThere is also the impression that<br />\nnon-science majors may have a<br />\nbetter chance of acceptance. Such<br />\na view may have been true once,<br />\nbut as this approach became more<br />\npopular, the advantage seems to<br />\nhave been lost. In Dr. Gryder's<br />\nopinion, the non-science major,<br />\nat a time when few in his or her<br />\ndiscipline actually applied to<br />\nmedical school, did hold some<br />\ngreater appeal to the interviewer.<br />\nIt is as if the interviewer would<br />\nmeet six or seven students who<br />\nwould discuss their research in<br />\n\"enzymatic crystallization\" and<br />\nthen chance upon the non-science<br />\nstudent who would discuss a book<br />\n<br />\nDr. John Gryder aids and assists medical school applicants as Health Pro<br />\nfessions Advisor<br />\nhe has read.

Sean Bramble<br />\nHere we are on the eve of<br />\nspring training, so I'll take this<br />\nopportunity to assess the 1988<br />\nrace. This will be a four-part article to be continued in the next<br />\nthree issues of the News-Letter, as<br />\nI'll be examining one division at<br />\na time.<br />\nHere's how I see the National<br />\nLeague West:<br />\n1. Cincinnati Reds. How many<br />\ntimes over the past few years<br />\nhave the Reds been picked to<br />\nfinish first? I don't know, but<br />\neach year they seem to finish<br />\nworse than predicted. Now that<br />\nthey've lost Dave Parker, people<br />\nare starting to assume that the<br />\nReds will finally slip the other<br />\nway. I disagree; I think it was a<br />\nheckuva time to trade the 36 yearold first baseman. His on-base<br />\npercentage last year was just<br />\nbarely over .300, his defensive<br />\nmobility is wretched, and even<br />\nhis arm isn't much good<br />\nanymore. Granted, the best prospect the Reds received in return<br />\nfor Parker was Jose Rijo (the A's<br />\nversion of a \"puzzle wrapped inside an enigma\"), but considering the state of the Reds' starting<br />\nstaff, I think it was a worthwhile<br />\ngamble. And don't forget that<br />\nthey've acquired Danny Jackson,<br />\none of the game's best pitchers.<br />\n2. San Francisco Giants. Picking the Giants to finish second<br />\nisn't my way of picking on the<br />\nteam, it's just my way of saying<br />\n<br />\nhow much I think of the Reds.<br />\nThe Giants are a solid club in<br />\nevery respect. But 1987 was just<br />\nanother example of a solid club<br />\nhaving everything break right for<br />\nit. I myself have doubts about<br />\nKevin Mitchell as a third<br />\nbaseman, about whether or not<br />\nRick Reuschel can do it another<br />\nyear, and about the entire pitching<br />\nstaff repeating its performance of<br />\nlast year. Sure, Roger Craig is a<br />\npitching genius; the Baltimore<br />\nOrioles once prided themselves<br />\non knowing a lot about pitching,<br />\ntoo.<br />\n3. Los Angeles Dodgers. The<br />\nfiring of Al Campanis was a<br />\nblessing in disguise for the<br />\nDodgers, for it gave them the opportunity to install a new GM,<br />\nFred Claire. Claire has been active, acquiring Sutton, Orosco,<br />\nGibson, Mike Davis, Jay Howell,<br />\nand Alfredo Griffin. Personally,<br />\nI think Gibson is the best of the<br />\npickups, but you can say that any<br />\nof the new Dodgers has helped fill<br />\na hole. But there's also a lot of<br />\ndiscontent in Tinseltown: Lasorda wants to be GM,Pedro doesn't<br />\nwant to be an outfielder, Pedro<br />\ndoesn't want to play anywhere<br />\nbut first base, Mike Marshall<br />\ndoesn't want to be moved from<br />\nfirst just for Pedro's sake. And<br />\nwho will play third for the<br />\nDodgers? Sax? Marshall? German Rivera? Steve Garvey? The<br />\nDodgers will be exciting and even<br />\ncontend, but I don't see them<br />\nwinning.<br />\n<br />\nCAMPUS NOTES<br />\nNOTES, from 28<br />\nAll welcome to an open talk on \"Hell<br />\nand Pain.\" Question and answer session afterward.

Houston Astros. As I said in<br />\nthe Giants comment, picking a<br />\nclub to finish lower than expected<br />\nisn't to denigrate the talents of the<br />\nclub, only to acknowledge that<br />\nthere are other good teams out<br />\nthere as well. Houston has Bill<br />\nDoran, Kevin Bass, Glenn Davis,<br />\nNolan Ryan, Mike Scott, and<br />\nDave Smith, plus the very<br />\ncapable Hal Lanier. But who will<br />\ncatch? And what is the left side<br />\nof the infield going to look like?<br />\nSo far, the Astros haven't offered<br />\nany good answers to those questions; instead, they have calmed<br />\nthemselves into thinking they can<br />\nwin with the talent nucleus they<br />\nalready have, propped up with a<br />\nfew retreads. That's a very<br />\ndangerous game to play.<br />\n5. San Diego Padres. A team<br />\nof great strengths and<br />\nweaknesses. In the strength column, the Padres can offer John<br />\nKruk, Tony Gwynn, Benito Santiago, and Eric Show. In the<br />\nweakness column, the Padres<br />\nhave Garry Templeton, Ed Whitson, losing Goose Gossage, and<br />\nacquiring Keith Moreland. I<br />\nmean, they picked up Moreland<br />\nbecause they needed power,<br />\nright? Well, away from Wrigley,<br />\nMoreland's homer totals have<br />\nbeen 3 (1984), 3 (1985), and 4<br />\n(1986). If you think he's a slugger, then you probably think<br />\nRafael Santana is a major league<br />\nballplayer, too.<br />\n6. Atlanta Braves.

Get your entries to the News-Letter Saloon by Wednesday, Feb. 24th at 5 o'clock,<br />\nin order to make last call.<br />\nwell done 'zlings. Many entries. The QM was very impressed<br />\nwith the 'zlings. Many entries, many correct answers, many laughs. Due to the mature (and<br />\nyes, embarrassing) nature of the quiz, the Eds have pleaded with me not to run the answers.<br />\nHowever, some will be run, so as to satiate the readers. Last week was National Condom<br />\nWeek, All in the Family first showed full frontal nudity (while changing Joey's diapers),<br />\nand yes, believe it or not, there are two sizes for condoms, one sold in the States, and the<br />\nother sold in the Orient. Oh and by the way, we have winners this week. No, it's not those<br />\nsame guys who won the last two weeks, but then again anyone who knows them knows that<br />\nbetween the three of them, they know nothing on the subject. The winners were Chetan The<br />\nkhinky ghuy Kharod, and Micah The gloved one Jackson. Chongrats ghuys, come by to<br />\ncollect your prize during our business hours. And please redeem your coupons within two<br />\nweeks! Or else you lose da beer!!<br />\n<br />\nResults: Well, well, very<br />\n<br />\nP.S.: Well the QM misjudged the 'zlings twice this past week. He thought it was a waste<br />\nto give out presents in last week's News-Letter. What would the average student here do with<br />\na condom, anyway? Then as the QM crossed the campus, he saw condom wrappers<br />\neverywhere. He thought he was at a real school, but thought the least people could do was<br />\nwait until they were back in their rooms to use them. Misjudgement #1. Upon closer examination, it was apparent that these condoms were not opened. So,just as soon as the QM<br />\nwas happy to learn he was wrong about Hoppies, he realized he was in fact right. Misjudgement #2. Gang, make love, not litter. If you don't want a condom, give it, sell it, or throw<br />\nit away properly. Leaving them lying on the campus is no solution, although it would make<br />\nBlue Keys' job much easier.<br />\nBy the way, the predictions found in the Sports section in no way reflect those of yours<br />\ntruly.

Tuition will go<br />\nup from the present $11,000 to<br />\n$12,000 dollars,\" said University<br />\nPresident Steven Muller Tuesday<br />\nto the Student Council.<br />\nThe increase of 9.1 percent<br />\nrepresents the fourteenth consecutive year that tuition has risen<br />\nby more than six percent. It has<br />\nrisen in constant dollars in each<br />\nof the last nine years, rising<br />\nroughly $3,100 in 1982 dollars.<br />\nDefending the tuition increase<br />\nwhen the current inflation index<br />\nis only four percent, Muller, accompanied by several deans,<br /><br />\ncited the increased expenditures<br />\nof the School of Arts and<br />\nSciences and the G.W.C.<br />\nWhiting School of Engineering<br />\non renovation and expansion of<br />\nfacilities as the primary reason.<br />\n\"Since students will benefit<br />\nfrom the improvements of<br />\nfacilities, it is legitimate to charge<br />\na small fraction of that expenditure to the students,\" said<br />\nMuller.<br />\nConsidering financial aid,<br />\nMuller added that the University<br />\nexpects to increase the<br />\nundergraduate student aid budget<br />\nby no less than the amount of the<br />\ntuition increase.

The grant<br />\nstipulates that $4 million be raised in fundraising for the library.<br />\nMcClain and Martin both expressed hopes that this goal can<br />\nbe achieved.<br />\nOne consequence of increasing<br />\nthe number of books ordered is<br />\nthe cutback in journal subscriptions. \"Prices of journal<br />\nsubscriptions are going right<br />\nthrough the roof,\" said Martin.<br />\n\"It's not unusual for the cost of<br /><br />\nThe extensions to the library's bookshelves.<br />\na foreign scientific journal to have Martin is considering relocating<br />\nincreased by 100 to 150 nonessential library staff offices<br />\npercent.\"<br />\noutside of MSE.<br />\nSenior David Piehl, a member<br />\nA team of University-hired arof the Library Advisory Commit- chitects has presented a feasibilitee, said \"We're in the process ty study on library expansion to<br />\nof deciding who's going to bear the Board of Trustees.

Users of the IBM,<br />\nVMS operating system, and the<br />\nAT&amp;T 3B20 Unix operating<br />\nbeen<br />\nnot<br />\nhave<br />\nsystem<br />\novercharged.<br />\nThe Tex processing language is<br /><br />\ndifferent from the standard form<br />\nof printing. Tex language has a<br />\ngreater quality and gives printouts<br />\nthe look of being typeset or<br />\nprinted in a print shop. Users of<br />\nthis type of laser printing are the<br />\nonly ones being affected by the<br />\novercharging.<br />\n\"The overcharging came as a<br />\nresult of doing some upgrading to<br />\nour operating system,\" said<br />\nDavid Binko, director of<br />\nacademic computing. \"It's not<br />\njust an overcharge, but an erratic<br />\ncharge. The problem has been<br />\nfound and corrected.\"<br />\nSenior Systems Programmer<br /><br />\nEric Moyer<br /><br />\nThe Shaffer 100 computer room.<br /><br />\nRonald Ray concurred, saying,<br />\n\"The problem arose when the<br />\nnewest version of the operating<br />\nsystem was installed. There was<br />\na bug in the system which kept<br />\ntrack of how the pages were<br />\ncounted for printouts, resulting in<br />\nthe overcharging.\"<br />\nCost to VMS operating system<br />\nusers is expected to be minimal<br />\nbecause the problem began during Intersession and was<br />\ndiscovered quite recently.<br />\nThe computing facilities at<br />\nHopkins, for most, work on an<br />\naccount system in which users are<br />\nalloted three \"computer\" dollars<br />\nper day of computer time and<br />\nmay accumulate up to $9 for use<br />\nin one day. Printouts cost ten<br />\ncents per page.<br />\nWith a system overcharging<br />\nusers, valuable computer time<br />\ncan be be wasted. For professors,<br />\nhowever, the problems could be<br />\nmuch worse.<br />\nProfessors pay to use the computer facilities with money from<br />\ntheir grants. The large amount of<br />\ncomputer time needed, coupled<br />\nwith an overcharging system,<br />\ncould put a real strain on the<br />\nbudgets of professors, according<br />\nto graduate student Xiao-Wei<br />\nZhu, who had a friend bring the<br />\nproblem to her attention after he<br />\nwas charged $5 for seven pages<br />\nof printout.<br />\n\"Many people I spoke with<br />\nwere simply assuming that the<br />\nprice for printouts went up,\" she<br />\nsaid. \"Everyone who used the<br />\nlaser printer was being overcharged, but no one was questioning the sudden rise in printout<br

/>\novershadow its interest in the<br />\ndevelopment of an economically<br />\nand politically stable and independent South Korea, said Thomas<br />\nDunlop, director of the Office of<br />\nKorean Affairs at the Department<br />\nof State, last Thursday at 8 p.m.<br />\nin the Great Hall.<br />\nThe Johns Hopkins University<br />\nForum on Korean Affairs, in conjunction with the Department of<br />\nPolitical Science, invited Dunlop<br />\nto speak in the first of a threelecture series titled, \"Korea: A<br />\nNation in Transition.\"<br />\nDunlop began by stressing the<br />\nimportance of South Korea's<br />\ngeopolitical position in Asia\u2014<br />\nSeoul being \"equidistant from<br />\nVostok, Beijing, and Tokyo\"\u2014<br />\nand the importance of a \"stable<br />\nand peaceful Korea\" to the U.S.<br />\nBut \"because we are<br />\nAmericans,\" the U.S. does not<br />\nbelieve in forcing policies, ideals,<br />\nand governments on South<br />\nKorea, said Dunlop.<br />\n\"Unless there was a stable<br />\ngovernment [in South Korea]<br />\nwith a broad base of support,<br />\ninstability\u2014political<br />\nand<br />\neconomic\u2014would ensue,\" said<br />\nDunlop.<br />\nDespite recent trade friction,<br />\nthe U.S. would also like to see<br /><br />\n\"continued growth of the commercial and trade relationship\"<br />\nbetween the U.S. and South<br />\nKorea, said Dunlop.<br />\nCigarettes, beef, and insurance, three markets in South<br />\nKorea recently found to be almost<br />\nclosed to U.S. companies, make<br />\nup only about five percent of<br />\ntrade between the two nations,<br />\nstressed Dunlop.<br />\nEntry into other markets is still<br />\ndifficult for U.S. competitors,<br />\nadded Dunlop, and if the South<br />\nKorean government does not in:<br />\ncrease the rate of opening markets<br />\nto the U.S., Congress could<br />\nbecome \"punitive and protectionist\" in pasing the upcoming<br />\nOmnibus Trade Bill.<br />\nDunlop added that South Korea<br />\nis a nation which \"must export to<br />\nlive,\" and must import U.S.<br />\ngoods fairly if the U.S. imports<br />\nKorean goods fairly.<br />\nTurning to a lighter subject,<br />\nDunlop praised the strengthening<br />\ncultural ties between the U.S. and<br />\nSouth Korea, especially in light<br />\nof the rapidly growing immigration rate of Koreans to the United<br />\nStates.<br />\nAmerican politicians, added<br />\n' Dunlop, should keep in mind that<br />\na \"large and positively contributing Korean society\" will<br />\nsoon be a major part of the<br />\nAmerican constituency.<br />\nA question-and-answer session<br /><br />\nfollowed tfie lecture, in which the<br />\nfirst audience member asked<br />\nwhether the U.S. State Department believed that North Korea<br />\nwas responsible for the recent<br />\ncrash of a Korean Air Lines jet<br />\nover Burma, in which 115 people died.<br />\nDunlop replied that the United<br />\nStates had come to the \"horrible<br />\nconclusion\" that North Korea<br />\nhad indeed bombed the airliner,<br />\npresumably to undermine international confidence in South<br />\nKorea's ability to hold the upcoming Summer Olympic Games<br />\nin Seoul.<br />\nAsked what steps the U.S.<br />\nwould take against North Korea,<br />\nDunlop replied that although the<br />\nU.S. has tried to focus international attention and condemnation<br />\non North Korea, the government<br />\nof South Korea ultimately must<br />\ntake action itself.<br />\n\"It isn't so much what we [the<br />\nU.S.] are going to do, it is what<br />\nthe people and government of<br />\n[South] Korea are going to do,\"<br />\nhe said. \"It's their plane and their<br />\nOlympiad.\"<br />\nAlthough the U.S. has since<br />\nplaced North Korea on a \"terrorist nation list,\" the U.S. has<br />\nhad no commercial or political<br />\nties with North Korea since the<br />\nKorean War, said Dunlop, who<br />\nSee KOREA, 6<br /><br />\nEric Moyer<br /><br />\nDavid Binko, director of academic computing, who explained why<br />\nstudents and faculty have been overcharged for laser printouts.<br />\nVarious steps are being taken<br />\nto insure that the problem is rectified. The Accounting Office<br />\nprovided a \"work around\" for<br />\nusers. Several commands that can<br />\nbe used for Tex output are listed<br />\nwhen users \"log on\" to the<br />\nsystem.<br />\nAlso, Accounting requested that<br />\nthose persons who have printed<br />\nTex output should come into the<br />\noffice or send electronic mail to<br />\nthe account \"ACCOUNT\" to see<br />\nif a refund is in order.<br />\n\"We will work with the user to<br />\nfigure out what kind of refund or<br />\ncredit is due and get that to them<br />\nas soon as possible,\" said Ray.<br />\nBinko noted, \"Unfortunately,<br />\n, charges for that laser printer are<br />\nlumped into the regular printing<br />\ncharges. So, we have no way of<br />\nunraveling<br />\nthe<br />\nactual<br />\novercharges.\"<br /><br />\nWhile the problem has been<br />\ncorrected, Binko urged that VAX<br />\n8600 Tex output users continue to<br />\nkeep records of their printouts<br />\nand fees to insure that they are not<br />\nor have not been overcharged.<br />\nAlso, he said, if users are going to be printing Tex output,<br />\nthey should utilize the command<br />\nTEX PRINT, which should insure that the pages are counted<br />\ncorrectly.<br />\nAnother area of concern for<br />\ncomputer facility terminal users<br />\nis the recent moving of the computer room's daily closing from<br />\n4 a.m. to 2 a.m. this semester.<br />\n\"Our main problem is that we<br />\ncannot find enough proctors to<br />\nwork the night shifts,\" explained Binko. \"We're budgeted to be<br />\nopen twenty-four hours a day.<br />\nWe just need people to work the<br />\nlater hours.\"<br /><br />\nGET BACK TO YOUR ROOTS<br /><br />\nOn Friday, February 19th,<br />\nJohn Waters will turn the<br />\n60s on its ear with a<br />\ncomedy that shows no mercy<br /><br />\nmovie by John Wters<br /><br />\nHAiR<br />\ngPR<br />\nMI LIR<br />\nWTI MUT V INCIMIAL MIT RN norm -1111.41LIF rems NM MI<br />\nIIVIV MIN \u2022 MIN \u2022 NM Lee \u2022 IJCII Lai us MIS 31111/1,,,,UI.PiAUNIA<br />\nmumnima OM Lit Nem MU=UMW EMI an 3,11.1 OMR MINIM MEM Mitmein INNIS<br />\nmum sr LIM TuALa wino so norm or Am114TILI<br /><br />\n(ULTPIA.111T111111111or<br /><br />\n*NES,<br /><br />\nWA C 1%1%14<br />\now..mon.mmirsimirm<br /><br />\n6/FEBRUARY 19, 1988<br /><br />\nMuller defends tuition hike<br />\nin light of budget problems<br />\n1Pledges sizable rise in student aid budget,<br />\nTUITION, from 1<br />\nwith reference to Robert Welch's<br />\nresignation as dean of<br />\nadministration.<br />\nNoting that Welch's position is<br />\nvery helpful to students because<br />\nthey go to him to address student<br />\nissues, FitzGerald asked, \"With<br />\nthe suggestion that[Welch] not be<br />\nreplaced, but instead that his<br />\nresponsibilities be shifted to the<br />\nacademic deans, will there still be<br />\nthe opportunities for students to<br />\nexpound on their grievances<br />\ntowards things like new dormitory housing and better student<br />\nfacilities?\"<br />\nHe continued, \"Will we be<br />\nable to go to a specific person for<br />\nthese things and will the extra<br />\nmoney that we're paying next<br />\nyear be directed towards these<br />\ngoals?\"<br />\nMuller stated that \"the reasons<br />\nfor [Welch's] leaving do not have<br />\nanything to do with the fiscal<br />\nsituations at the University.\"<br />\nHe added, \"While it is quite<br />\nclear that we need someone to<br />\nplay the role Bob Welch has<br />\nplayed,'' the present administrative hierarchy resulted in<br />\na \"complicated relationship\" between the Homewood deans,<br />\nwhich resulted in \"a great difficulty in clarifying the lines of<br />\nresponsibility.\"<br />\nThe President then deferred to<br />\nLloyd Armstrong, dean of the<br />\nSchool of Arts and Sciences, and<br />\nV.

Usually, he said, this<br />\nwith<br />\nmoney is donated<br />\nrestrictions.<br />\n\"The bulk of our donors are<br />\nsimply not the undergraduate<br />\nalumni of Johns Hopkins,\" he<br />\nsaid. \"Some of the largest gifts<br />\ncome from grateful patients of<br />\nour physicians and slightly more<br />\nthan half of the $450 million is<br />\ndesignated for Hopkins Medical<br />\nSchool.\"<br />\nAs a result, continued Muller,<br />\n\"it is difficult to raise money in<br />\nsupport of the Department of<br />\nEnglish or the Department of<br />\nHistory than it is to raise money<br />\nfor opthalmology, cancer<br />\nresearch, or any of the medical<br />\nproblems that beset the human<br />\nrace. . . because nobody ever died<br />\nof English.\"<br />\nSaying that \"there is virtually<br />\nno discretionary money in that<br />\n$403 million\" that has already<br />\nbeen raised, Muller conclued, \"I<br />\ncan tell you quite certainly that<br />\nArts and Sciences is running at a<br />\ndeficit and will continue to run at<br />\na deficit. This would be brutally<br /><br />\nMuller responded that tuition is<br />\nnot directly allocated back to the<br />\ndepartments. Tuition stays in<br />\neither school and is used by the<br />\nrespective dean to fund operations. \"The departments simply<br />\ndo not have the funds that would<br />\nallow for a great duplication of<br />\nmaterials that they want the<br />\nstudents to read,\" said Muller.<br />\nSophomore Class Representative George Lerner then asked<br />\nif money being allocated to such<br />\nprograms as the Nanjing Center<br />\nare, in effect, hurting the<br />\nundergraduates by taking funds<br />\naway from the School of Arts and<br />\nSciences, which is facing a<br />\n_budget deficit.<br />\nMuller answered, \"I do not<br />\nthink that undergraduates are affected by the budgetary situations<br />\nin Arts and Sciences. The suspension of commitments has been<br />\nlifted ...and there will be<br />\nreplacements of people, particularly people who teach<br />\nundergraduates, who have either<br />\nleft or died.

He<br />\nasked what would be done to insure that these students will not<br />\nbe squeezed out of the system as<br />\na result of trends in increasing<br />\ntuition.<br />\nMuller responded, \"I am concerned about squeezing out the<br />\nmiddle income students.

Emotionally, it is hard<br />\nto accept a $1000 rise in tuition in a<br />\nsingle year.<br />\nWhile University President Steven<br />\nMuller addressed the Student Council<br />\nthis week, he proposed that students<br />\nmust help pay for improving the school.<br />\nThe increase, according to Muller, is<br />\ngoing toward renovation and expansion<br />\nof facilities.<br />\nFielding questions from Council<br />\nmembers, Muller maintained that this<br />\nwas the only cause for the increase. The<br />\nsituation for Homewood, in other<br />\nwords, is status quo. Budget deficits and<br />\nother projects such as the Nanjing<br />\nCenter are not sucking up under-<br /><br />\nup, and up<br /><br />\ngraduate tuition money.<br />\nOther matters that are in Hopkins<br />\ndirect interest besides improving<br />\nfacilities do lay claim to our money.<br />\nQuite justly, 20 cents on every dollar<br />\nof tuition goes to financial aid. Muller<br />\nacknowledges how important this is,<br />\nand how still more must be done.<br />\nA more natural conclusion than any<br />\nother is that Hopkins is acting with fiscal<br />\nresponsibility; rising costs and maintaining and upgrading the school is costing<br />\neveryone involved more money.<br />\nThe issue of constantly rising tuition<br />\nraises serious concern. If this increase<br />\ncomes in a status quo situation, is a 6%<br />\nannual increase a permanent fixture? If<br />\nso, the future has a somewhat gloomy<br />\ntint for years of students facing<br />\nastronomical bills for higher education;<br />\nit looks still gloomier for universities<br />\nwho will inevitably take cuts in the<br />\ndiversity and quality of the students who<br />\ncan attend them.<br /><br />\nA Little Leeway<br /><br />\nGratuitous Gunplay<br />\nby A. Lee Davis<br />\nOn my way into Super-Food,<br />\ndown on Greenmount, I glanced<br />\nat the window of a neighboring<br />\nvideo store, and there saw<br />\nsomething I found at once too<br />\nironic to go by unreported. In the<br />\ncorner of the window,just above<br />\nthe sill, was a poster which<br />\ndepicted the business end of a<br />\n.38. Underneath were the words,<br />\n\"If you see a gun, call.\" I'd seen<br />\nthe poster before\u2014in WaWa,outside of 7-11\u2014but I'd never<br />\nglimpsed it in the decidedly incongruous circumstances which<br />\nthen confronted me. Above the<br />\nposter was Charles Bronson, a<br />\n.44 as big as his head jutting from<br />\nhis grip. To the right were Lee<br />\nMarvin and Chuch Norris, submachine guns blazing. To the left<br />\nwas some no-name with a determined grimace and a gleaming<br />\npistol. It was almost funny. If you<br />\nsee a gun . . .<br />\nSkin-flicks and vengeanceoriented films have many things<br />\nin common. They are both easy<br />\nto write, cast, and shoot. They<br />\nboth sacrifice artistic quality for<br />\nmass appeal to questionable emotions. They both bring in big<br />\nbucks for a relatively paltry investment. Much time, and even<br />\nmore money, has been spent investigating how exposure to pornography affects male viewers.<br />\nDoes watching blue movies incite<br />\nmen to commit rape? From what<br />\nI've read, the answer is no.<br />\nHowever, men who were constantly exposed to pornographic<br />\nimages did ossify in one specific<br />\nway. The movies created an attitude of tolerance; brutality<br /><br />\ntowards women began to be<br />\noverlooked.<br />\nNow, in most video store,s, a<br />\nfifteen-year-old can't get his<br />\nhands on \"All American Girls in<br />\nHeat,\" but he has his choice of<br />\nthe newest revenge/slasher/shoot<br />\n'em ups. If he has access to a<br />\nVCR and $1.50 to spare, he can<br />\nwatch (in slow motion) a bullet<br />\npierce someone's brain, obliterate<br />\nsomeone's chest, knock someone<br />\nthrough a ten-story window.<br />\nWhile everyone who watches<br />\nthese movies will not go out and<br />\nshoot someone, again, an attitude<br />\nis created in the viewer, a belief<br />\nthat violence is always justified,<br />\nthat for every situation, a gun is<br />\nthe answer.<br />\nIn these films, potency is<br />\nequated with violence. The<br />\ncharacter's very gender is incorportated in his weapon. Who is<br />\nDirty Harry without his Smith &amp;<br />\nWesson? Who is Rambo without<br />\nhis ridiculously phallic 12-inch<br />\nknife? This association is not as<br />\ndangerous to me or my peers as<br />\nit is to young men still in their<br />\nvaguely defined \"formative<br />\nyears.\" According to these<br />\nmovies, to be a man is to blow<br />\naway those who have offended<br />\nyou. Gender identification is that<br />\nsimple.<br />\nI'm particularly concerned<br />\nabout the young men of Baltimore<br />\nCity, whose penchant for<br />\nshooting each other has<br />\nsociologists, religious leaders,<br />\nand community spokesmen<br />\nscreaming for a halt.

Many have hoped he would<br />\nenter this year's presidential race;<br />\nperhaps it is his abstinence which has<br />\nmade him that much more appealing.<br />\nRegradless, Cuomo is likely to provide a most interesting speech for those<br />\nin attendance this May.<br />\nWe commend the speaker committee<br />\nfor their ability to aquire such a widelyrecognized, quality speaker. The committee has to work within stringent<br />\nbudgetary constraints while trying to attract a lucrative speaker. Past commit-<br /><br />\ntees, working under similar limitations,<br />\nwere sometimes far less successful.<br />\nEven last year's speaker choice was a<br />\ndubious one. The committee selected<br />\nHoward Cosell\u2014a well-known personality, yes; however, the sportscaster<br />\nseemed to be an unlikely choice, considering the nature of the school. (Or<br />\nperhaps it was his tragic flaw\u2014his<br />\nreference to the John Hopkins<br />\nUniversity\u2014which left everyone with a<br />\nsour taste in their mouths.)<br />\nMario Cuomo, on the other hand, has<br />\na popular appeal which is enhanced by<br />\nhis intellectual ability. In this election<br />\nyear, his presence will be that much<br />\nmore timely.<br />\nThe Graduation Speaker Committee<br />\ndeserves a special thanks for their efforts; this year's Commencement will<br />\nsurely be a memorable one.<br /><br />\nBrad Handler, Elizabeth Harrigan<br />\nEditors<br />\nFlory Ware<br />\nBusiness Manager<br />\nGlen Weiss<br />\nManaging Editor<br />\nAnn Ginsberg, Diana Zeiger<br />\nProduction Managers<br />\nEly Brown<br />\nLayout Editor<br />\nKathleen McCarthy, Jonathan Stempel<br />\nNews Editors<br />\nPhil Gochenour, Mark W.

But I would<br />\nlike to call to the attention of the<br />\nNews-Letter's readership two<br />\ntelephone calls I received the day<br />\nof that issue's publication.<br />\nMy comic strip for that issue<br />\nfocused three of its four panels on<br />\nthe completely and obviously fictitious conversation between the<br />\ntwo Editors-in-Chief of the NewsLetter, Elizabeth Harrigan and<br />\nBrad Handler. As the strip went,<br />\nBrad wondered increduously how<br />\nLiz could include the condoms in<br />\nthat week's News-Letter without<br />\nfirst checking with any administration officials, particularly Dean of Students Chris Colombo. Liz replied that Brad was<br />\noverreacting: \"You never know<br />\nwhat [Dean Colombo's] reaction<br />\nmight be . . .\"The fourth panel of<br />\nthe strip featured an impressive<br />\ndesktop and accompanying chair,<br />\nobviously Dean Colombo's office, and an anonymous thoughtballoon, obviously the Snoopyesque \"unattributed\" words of<br />\nDean Colombo himself: \"Whoa?<br />\nWhat's this. . . A condom\u2014.. .<br />\nMmm . . .Goucher, here I<br />\ncome!\"<br />\nWell, that Friday afternoon, I<br />\nreceived a telephone call from a<br />\ngirl who identified herself as a<br />\nGoucher student. She asked me to<br />\n\"explain\" my strip, as she<br />\n\"didn't see any humor in it at<br />\nall.\" I explained that I'd be pleased to do so, but that first she<br />\nwould have to tell me what she<br />\nsupposed I meant by the strip; had<br />\nshe any clue at all? \"You can't<br />\neven construct a simple<br />\nhypothesis as to what it might<br />\nmean?\" My caller admitted that<br />\nthis was indeed a task beyond her<br />\ncapabilities.<br />\nI explained the humor in the<br />\ncartoon (despite my conviction<br />\nthat analysis kills humor), by trying to convey the incongruity of<br />\nan administration official: A)not<br />\nbeing told beforehand about<br />\nsomething like putting condoms<br />\nin the school newspaper; B) not<br />\nminding that someone put condoms in the school newspaper;<br />\nand C), actually glad for the fact,<br />\nand ready to take advantage of his<br />\ngood fortune by chasing collegeaged girls at a traditional nearby<br />\nmixing scene.<br /><br />\nJust when 1 thought that she<br />\nwas an inch closer to getting this<br />\nremarkably subtle and complex<br />\njoke, she told me that the cartoon<br />\n\"was a sick portrayal of Goucher<br />\nstudents.\" Stung, I responded<br />\nthat no portrayal of any Goucher<br />\nstudent actually appeared in the<br />\ncartoon\u2014only one man's obviously facetious perception of<br />\nGoucher, for his chances for<br />\n\"scoring\" there were actually<br />\nportrayed. After awhile, I thanked her for her time and<br />\ninitiative\u2014after all, I am always<br />\neager to hear any comments about<br />\n\"With Eyes Closed\"\u2014and hung<br />\nup.<br />\nNot more than three minutes<br />\nlater, I received a call from<br />\nanother girl, who also identified<br />\nherself as a Goucher student. And<br />\nalthough this new caller dialed<br />\nmy number to complain about the<br />\nstrip only seconds after the first<br />\nGoucher student, she claimed not<br />\nto know her predecessor. Fancy<br />\nthat! No calls on a strip for nearly two years, and then two<br />\nstrangers call to complain about<br />\nthe same strip within minutes of<br />\none another! I must remember to<br />\nget in touch with Ripley's.<br />\nAnyway, the second caller raised similar objections, and<br />\ndemanded an apology, which she<br />\nclaimed was something more than<br />\na few Goucher students wanted<br />\nfrom me. (And, although I was<br />\nlater told by a friend that several<br />\nangry letters were on their way,<br />\nthe News-Letter has to date not<br />\nreceived any.) \"All humor is at<br />\nsomeone's expense,\" I told her.<br />\nShe begged to differ with that, but<br />\nstopped doing so once I told her<br />\nthat that was a quotation from<br />\nGroucho Marx, who I presumed<br />\nknew more about humor than<br />\neither one of us. I then also explained that I failed to see how a<br />\nGoucher student could construe<br />\nthe humor of this cartoon as being at Goucher College's<br />\nexpense.<br />\nThe real point here is that my<br />\nstrip was wholly inoffensive, and,<br />\nas such, I can't really see<br />\napologizing to anyone, least of all<br />\nGoucher students, who were not<br />\neven satirized in any way. My second caller said that any school's<br />\nname could have gone in place of<br />\nGoucher's, and I reminded her<br />\nthat Goucher has historically been<br />\nlinked to Johns Hopkins,<br />\nespecially as a social scene for<br />\nmales, since the female-male<br /><br />\nratio at Goucher exceeds our<br />\nown. To whom is this not an accepted fact?

His knowledge<br />\nof baseball is excellent, and the<br />\ncolumn spiced up a flat Sports<br />\nsection. But to have to read about<br />\nbaseball in November overdid it.<br />\nAnd now in early February, he is<br />\nback. Sean, can't you write about<br />\nthe NBA, NHL, or Winter Olympics and save your baseball for<br />\nthe week before Major League<br />\nbaseball starts? Your writing is<br />\nfine; it's the timing that is bad.<br />\nGreg Bronsvag<br /><br />\nInvolvement in Honor<br />\nTo the Editor:<br />\nSeveral weeks ago, the Student<br />\nCouncil formed an ad hoc committee to investigate the possibility of reintroducing an honor<br />\nsystem to Hopkins. As a member<br />\nof this committee, lam writing to<br />\nurge students to become actively<br />\ninvolved in this committee and its<br />\nfunctions.<br />\nStudent involvement will make<br />\nor break any honor system.<br />\nThis fact has already been<br /><br />\nclearly seen here at Hopkins.<br />\nBoth the old honor system's abandonment in the mid 1970's and<br />\nthe ineffectiveness of the present<br />\nethics system can be attributed to<br />\nlow student participation. From<br />\nour experiences at Hopkins, we<br />\nknow that any honor system that<br />\nis introduced here must have the<br />\nfull support of the student body<br />\nin order to be effective.<br />\nThis committee is presently<br />\nconsidering instituting an entirely student-run honor system<br />\nsimilar to those at Princeton and<br />\nthe University of Virginia.<br />\nSeveral details of the proposed<br />\nsystem are disclosed in the adjoining letters. Hopefully, the<br />\ncharacteristics of this system will<br />\nencourage students to take an active role in upholding academic<br />\nhonor at Hopkins.<br />\nDetails of the proposal aside,<br />\nthe fact remains that Hopkins<br />\nstudents must make a conscious<br />\neffort to be active in the development and maintenance of such a<br />\nsystem. I urge interested students<br />\nto become involved with this<br />\ncommittee. I also urge every student to talk amongst their friends<br />\nabout this idea and about what<br />\nhonor means to a University community. If Hopkins students are<br />\never to enjoy the benefits of a<br />\nstudent-run honor system, they<br />\nmust be active in its implementation now.<br /><br />\nHC Feasibility<br />\nTo the Editor:<br /><br />\nMany questions emerge as we<br />\ndiscuss a viable alternative to the<br />\ncurrent ethics code. One issue<br />\nwith which we are grappling is<br />\nhow to inject an honor code into<br />\nthe current climate. Most people<br />\nconsider the honor code a good<br />\nand noble idea, if only we lived<br />\nin an ideal world.<br />\nI agree; it is simply unrealistic<br />\nto consider such an option.<br />\nHopkins may not be ideal, but<br />\nover time, I believe we can<br />\ndevelop an honor code which<br />\nmay be phased in over a period<br />\nof several years. The Admissions<br />\nprocess and Orientation program<br />\ncan inculcate a sensitivity to and<br />\npride in an honor code from the<br />\n'beginning.<br />\nFirst, we need to introduce applicants to the honor code in the<br />\nadmissions process, establishing<br />\nan awareness of the issue prior to<br />\ntheir arrival at Hopkins. From<br />\nthere, it can be continued in the<br />\nOrientation program. Orientation<br />\noffers an opportune time to introduce students to the Hopkins<br />\nethics policy. Ethics could be a<br />\nfocal point in the speeches and<br />\ntours to which freshmen are subjected to upon their arrival.<br />\nDiscussions of what it is, of the<br />\nresponsibilities inherent in it, of<br />\nDavid Hannan the benefits derived, and of why<br /><br />\nit developed are placed easily<br />\namong the programs. Student Advising and Housemaster training<br />\naffords another captive audience.<br />\nAs the creators of first impressions, we can establish a tone<br />\nconducive to an honor code.<br />\nWe have discussed a program<br />\nwith features to be added and<br />\nchanged with each incoming<br />\nclass, and as awareness and<br />\nresponsibility grow in the community. Feasibility must be<br />\nweighed in all these considerations. Ultimately, in four to five<br />\nyears we would like to see selfscheduled, unproctored exams.<br />\nHowever, we need to give the<br />\ncommunity time to adjust to the<br />\nnew program, and to develop a<br />\nsense of pride in the system. Most<br />\npeople concede that the current<br />\nsystem does not really work. We<br />\nneed suggestions and concerns<br />\nfrom the entire student body.<br />\nHopkins students deserve better<br />\nthan the current system.

Tension, lack of trust,<br />\nand cutthroat competition all contribute to a feeling of unease and<br />\nintensity that is counterproductive. Students go away to college<br />\nnot only to study, but to learn<br />\nhow to cope with real life, how<br />\nto rely on each other for<br />\nassistance, and to develop faith in<br />\ntheir peers.<br />\nIt has been said that a student<br />\ncan learn as much from a twohour discussion with a friend late<br />\nat night in the dorms as she can<br />\nin three weeks worth of lectures.<br />\nThis is true not only because we<br />\ncan learn from others' ex-,<br />\nperiences, but because such<br />\ndiscussion helps clarify our own<br />\nvalues while instilling a tolerance<br />\nfor other opinions. Unfortunately, because of the intensely<br />\nsingle-minded academic atmosphere-at Hopkins, there is little opportunity to foster such contact and maturity.<br />\nInstead, at Hopkins students are<br />\nwary of one another, the competition for \"the edge\" squeezing out<br />\nmuch of the comraderie that is<br />\npresent at other undergraduate<br />\nschools and even professional<br />\nschools and which usually tends<br />\nto cement bonds of fellowship and<br />\ngoodwill.<br />\nThere is very little sense of<br />\n\"we are all in this together,\" but<br />\ninstead competition is carried to<br />\nsuch an extreme that it is the end<br />\npurpose; the goal is not<br />\nknowledge or learning, but who<br />\ncan score the highest on a given<br />\nexam or in a particular class.

Gitlitz<br /><br />\nHC: Promoting Values<br />\nTo the Editor:<br />\nI have, on prior occasions, used this forum to charaterize the<br />\ncampus environment here as \"oppressive and stifling\" and to lament the \"insane quest for GPA<br />\npoints\" which seems to be the<br />\nprimary activity of every Hopkins<br />\nstudent. On this occasion, I wish<br />\nto utilize this forum to discuss a<br />\nway in which we can effect a fundamental change in the nature of<br />\nour school and thereby render my<br />\nprevious observations invalid.<br />\nThe way is to reestablish an<br />\nHonor Code at Hopkins. An active Honor Code would effectively control one key phenomenon<br />\nthat is a complete anathema to the<br />\nbuilding of a true campus community: cutthroat competition.<br />\nCertain students at Hopkins,<br />\nseeking to compete with their<br />\nclassmates for academic honors<br />\nand prestige, utilize methods to<br />\nimprove their standing in this ,<br />\ncompetition which are in direct<br />\nviolation with the standards of the<br />\nUniversity and of common<br />\nhuman decency. The paranoia<br />\nthat is created by this contest<br />\nfosters distrust among the<br />\nstudents. Unity can never be<br />\nachieved in this environment.<br />\nIn this day and age when<br />\nacademic excellence is so highly<br />\nprized, and thus, so richly<br />\nrewarded, we have lost sight of<br />\nthe basic mission of this school:<br />\nto educate its students.

We the students,<br />\nwith common bonds and common<br />\nbelieves, are all here together to<br />\nbetter ourselves. Why must we<br />\nconsistently tear ourselves apart<br />\nover the drive to become #1?<br />\nThe reinstitution of an Honor<br />\nCode at Hopkins will cause us to<br />\nremember many of the basic<br />\nvalues we learned as children:<br /><br />\nresponsibility, trust, sharing and<br />\nhonor. At the same time, it will<br />\ncause us to recall those actions<br />\nwhich we have always considered<br />\nto.be wrong: lying, stealing and<br />\ncheating. Once we finally<br />\nrecognize the lunacy of our present endeavors, and move to<br />\nreinstitute an Honor Code, all of<br />\nus will benefit, if not from a<br />\nmarked improvement in the<br />\nqualitiy of life, then certainly<br />\nfrom a marked improvement in<br />\nthe clarity of our consciences.<br /><br />\nIf you would like to get involved or have questions, please call<br />\nme at 889-5145.<br />\nTy Hyderally<br /><br />\nHC and Integrity<br />\nTo the Editor:<br />\nWhy are we as students tempted to cheat? Some would argue<br />\nthat the system itself with its intense academic competitiveness<br />\nand grades based upon curves virtually compels one to cheat.

I<br />\nhasten to add that in the West<br />\nBank and Gaza under Arab rule<br />\nthe average income was $100 per<br />\nannum while under the Israelis it<br />\nrose to $1000. Perhaps, conditions are not as they should be<br />\nyet; but Israel is making an effort<br />\nthat the Arab states never made.<br />\nRather, the Arab states have been<br />\nthe worst enemies of the Palestinians.

Only Sadat has made the step while\"<br />\nthe other Arab leaders have rejected negotiations and challenged Israel's right to exist.<br />\nHarrell speaks with seeming<br />\nsupport for the PLO and questions why Israel does not<br />\nnegotiate with them. The PLO is<br />\nnot a nation, but rather an extreme fringe of terrorists.

Both men have intimate<br />\nties to the PLO. If Harrell did his<br />\nhomework he would see that<br />\nAwad has been very involved<br />\nwith armed struggle and preaches<br />\nnon-violent action only in addition to very violent action.<br />\nHowever, I would assume that<br />\nthat fact held no use for Harrell.<br />\nPaul Diamond<br /><br />\nArab\u2014Israeli Conflict<br />\nTo the Editor:<br />\nAssuming that all that the supporters of the Israeli idea hold<br />\nagainst Arabs is true, does that<br />\nwin the case for Israel, for, clearly, we acquiesce to all of its proponent attacks?<br />\nWe do not think so, and for the<br />\nmain reason: we believe that what<br />\nshould preoccupy the interested<br />\nobserver is not so much the past<br />\nArab-Israeli behaviour as the<br />\nquestion of Israel, or rather Israel<br />\nand its legitimacy as a question.<br />\nFor assuming we do prove the il-<br /><br />\nlegitimacy of Israel, does not that<br />\nwin the case against Israel and,<br />\nfrom this point of view, settle the<br />\nwhole Arab-Israeli issue?<br />\nAnd for us, legitimacy is established by demonstrated land<br />\nproprietorship and not devious<br />\nnotions of biblical rights. For the<br />\nsake of our argument, consider<br />\nthis: In the 1920's the Jewish<br />\ncommunity consisted of 10 percent of the total population that<br />\ninhabited the region that we shall<br />\ncall, for historical reasons,<br />\nPalestine. By the late 1940's that<br />\ncommunity grew to form 30 percent of the total, an increase<br />\nmostly due to immigration of<br />\nJewish war survivors. In 1948,<br />\nthe community, half of which<br />\nconsisted of recent immigrants<br />\nwho could not have lived in<br />\nPalestine for more than five<br />\nyears, claimed 56 percent of the<br />\nPalestinian territory for the creation of the Israeli state.<br />\nToday, after two additional<br />\nwars, the Jewish comunity, expanded by subsequent incomers<br />\nfrom the rest of the world, controls the whole of Palestine. Now,<br />\nthe lands seized since 1948 have<br />\nbeen victory fruits of wars that,<br />\nwe will admit, the Arabs provoked. Consequently, if the 1948<br />\nIsraeli state proves to be<br />\nlegitimate, that is if the Jewish<br />\ncommunity behind its creation did<br />\nown every square inch of the land<br />\nit claimed for its statehood, then<br />\nIsrael had the right to exist in<br />\n1948, the subsequent Arab at-<br /><br />\ntacks were unwarranted, the further occupation of Arab territories is a consequence of<br />\nwrongdoings that must be accepted and, finally, today's Israeli<br />\npolicies in the occupied territories<br />\ndefensive<br />\nare justifiable<br />\nmeasures. But if, on the other<br />\nhand, it is not the case that 20 percent of the population (an extremely generous figure; 10 percent for the original Jewish inhabitants and 10 percent more for<br />\nhalf of the subsequent immigrants<br />\nwho did actually purchase land)<br />\nshould have owned 56 percent of<br />\nthe territory, then Israel could not<br />\nhave come about without illegtimate and therefore forceful<br />\nland appropriations at the expense<br />\nof native populations, and, furthermore, the present measures in<br />\nthe occupied territories are acts<br />\nthat aim at the preservation of a<br />\nstate which is fundamentally illegitimate. In that case, we can<br />\nnot speak of Israel's right to exist before that right is at least legal<br />\nand legitimate. But do not<br />\nmisunderstand us: we are not<br />\nclaiming the contested lands actually belonged to Arabs, nor that<br />\nthey were part of a Palestinian<br />\nstate; it is quite all right that the<br />\nlands should belong to no one; let<br />\nthem be for everyone's use but let<br />\nno one unjustifiably appropriate<br />\nthem. So, above all, do not<br />\nmistake us for what we aren't; we<br />\nsimply hold the view that Israel<br />\nis illegitimate and we do so<br />\nbecause many of us were victims<br /><br />\nof such illegitimacy and had to<br />\nlose their land to provide for someone else's house. In the ArabIsraeli conflict we should be<br />\npreoccupied more by justice than<br />\nanything else, especially an unjust<br />\npeace.<br />\nNehme Ayoub<br /><br />\nJustifying Absurdity<br />\nTo the Editor:<br />\nReading the last issue of the<br />\nNews-Letter one cannot help but<br />\nsmile at the absurdity of some of<br />\nthe letters to the editor. The absurdity is not the attempted<br />\njustification of the barbaric<br />\nmeasures taken by the Israelis<br />\nagains unarmed, civilian<br />\ndemonstrators. There really is no<br />\nneed for justifying such actions<br />\nbecause anyone who has closely<br />\nmonitoried the conflict would<br />\nhave anticipated the Israelis to<br />\ntake precisely these measures.<br />\nThe absurdity lies in the<br />\nunderlying attempts at justifying<br />\nIsrael's land claims. Indeed by<br />\nreferring to the ocupied territories<br />\nas Judea and Samaia, the Israelis<br />\nand their apologists are reminding<br />\nus of the Biblical claims of the<br />\nJews over these lands. I still cannot believe how, at the dawn of<br />\nthe 21st century, some ostensibly<br />\nrational people are justifying<br />\npolitical and military actions by<br />\nthe alleged land claims of what<br />\ncan be viewed as a 6000 year-old<br /><br />\ntribal god.<br />\nIf we must regress ourselves to<br />\nthe maturity of 4000 B.C.E.<br />\npolitics, I feel compelled to present the land claims of my own<br />\npeople. Baal, the god of my<br />\nPhoenician ancestors, tells us that<br />\nwe are his chosen people. In fact,<br />\nPhoenicia (today's Lebanon extended north to Tartous in Syria<br />\nand south to Jaffa) is our divine<br />\nright.

Kyle McCarter.<br />\nRoseman said that the administration \"was trying to accomodate students' concerns.\"<br />\nDean of Administration Robert<br />\nWelch acknowledged several major problems that were faced by<br />\nstudents at the end of last<br />\nsemester: the loss of a reading<br />\nperiod (and requisite loss of study<br />\ntime); the finals schedule not being distributed until November 9,<br />\nmaking it too late for some<br />\nstudents to get discount or in<br />\nsome cases even regular flights<br />\nhome in time for Christmas or<br />\nChanukkah; and the closing of the<br />\ndorms on December 23\u2014the last<br />\nday of exams\u2014leaving some<br />\nstudents with nowhere to stay if<br />\ntheir flights were on the 24th.<br />\nRegistrar Robert Cyphers listed<br />\nseveral factors causing these<br /><br />\nproblems:<br />\n\u2022 According to a decision made<br />\nby Student Council 5 years ago,<br />\nthe fall semester will not start until the Thursday after Labor Day.<br />\nThere are between 105 to 111<br />\ndays between Labor Day and<br />\nChristmas Eve. This year had 105<br />\ndays, allowing no room for a<br />\nreading period. Under this present system, next year there will<br />\nbe a reading period of one day.<br />\n\u2022 The decision tq include a Fall<br />\nBreak of one day into the calendar pushed the finals period a day<br />\ncloser to Christmas Eve.<br />\n\u2022The actual eight-day final exam period further crammed the<br />\nschedule. Until the academic year<br />\n1986-87, there was a ten-day final<br />\nexam period and no Fall Break.<br />\nThe present final exam system<br />\nschedules exams in groups.<br />\nGroups are composed of classes<br />\nmeeting at the same times and of<br />\nsequential subject matter. For example, in one group there might<br />\nbe the mathematics sequence of<br />\nPre-Calculus through Calculus<br />\nIV; in another sequence, intro<br />\nand upper-level chemistry<br />\ncourses.<br />\nAccording to Cyphers, there<br />\nare 18 groups based purely on the<br />\ntime of the first meeting day of<br />\nclass. With an exam period of 16<br />\nexam times (2 per day), some<br />\ni groups had to be combined.<br />\nThe class time schedule is not<br />\nabsolute. Some small seminar<br />\nclasses which change meeting<br />\ntimes do not follow this pattern.<br />\nAlso, the registrar's office tries<br />\nto accommodate faculty requests<br />\nto change exam days and times.<br />\nCyphers noted that another factor which was considered was<br />\nseparating large, predominantly<br />\nfreshman class exams by one day.<br />\nAs for why the finals schedule<br />\ndid not come out until November,<br />\nthe Registrar explained that the<br />\nschedule could not be made up<br />\nuntil enrollment had stabilized.<br />\nHopkins schedules exams by<br /><br />\nFile Photo<br /><br />\nAssociate Dean and Director of Academic Advising Martha A.

He believes the process<br />\n\"is more of an art than a science\"<br />\nand is subject to personal judgement to resolve various conflicts.<br />\nWhat changes are being proposed to improve the finals<br />\n.scheduling process? According to<br />\nMcCarter's draft proposal, which<br />\n'came out of a meeting of the<br />\nHomewood Deans, the finals<br />\nschedule would be published<br />\nwhen students were scheduling<br />\ntheir classes for the semester.<br />\nThis would allow them to choose<br />\nclasses with the consideration of<br />\nwhen finals were going to occur.<br />\nIn addition, the scheduling of<br />\nfinal exams would be based on<br />\nthe first meeting time of the week<br />\nfor a class.<br />\nAt that meeting, students on the<br />\nCUS suggested changes in this<br /><br />\nproposal. One problem cited was<br />\naccommodating faculty who<br />\nwanted to give exams outside this<br />\nfixed period.<br />\nRoseman said that the idea<br />\nbehind this proposal was to allow<br />\nstudents and faculty \"to know in<br />\nadvance when the exams were<br />\ngoing to be,\" if conflicts arose.<br />\nCUS member Jeff De Cagna<br />\nbelieves that the proposal is a<br />\n\"good schedule because it provides students with flexibility. . . and time to work out<br />\nscheduling conflicts.\" De Cagna<br />\nadded that it would also allow<br />\nmore flexibility in making travel<br />\nplans.<br />\nAs for solutions to the dormitory problems faced by<br />\nfreshmen, Welch explained that<br />\nthere was a security problem<br />\nwhen few students are left in the<br />\ndorms. The numbers of students<br />\nprovide security, but when there<br />\nare only a few students scattered<br />\nthroughout the dorms, it is much<br />\nharder to make sure that they are<br />\nsafe. Assistant Director of Housing Tracey Angel said that it was<br /><br />\nin the housing contract to close<br />\nthe dorms on the last day of<br />\nfinals; however, if a significant<br />\nnumber of students had problems,<br />\nthe university would try to accomodate them.<br />\nAccording to Welch, any student who could not leave by the<br />\nnight of the 23rd, when the dorms<br />\nclosed, should have received<br />\novernight housing from the<br />\nuniversity. Angel said that threefreshmen asked for and received<br />\nuniversity guest rooms.<br />\nHowever, freshman Paul<br />\nRobinson was told by a Housing<br />\nOffice receptionist that \"there<br />\nwasn't anything available.\"<br />\nWhen he told her that he knew of<br />\nanother student who had received housing, the receptionist<br />\n\"basically told me it was too<br />\nlate.\"<br />\n\"If that was the case,\" said<br />\nWelch, commenting on the above<br />\nsituation, \"then it was an unfortunate case of misinformation on<br />\nthe part of the University<br />\nemployee. lam not aware of any<br />\ndeadline.<br /><br />\nHow other schools<br />\nschedule finals<br />\nOther universities face<br />\nsimilar concerns when scheduling finals.

Hopkins students are<br />\nculturally retarded. What other<br />\nconclusion could be drawn from<br />\nthe fact that the full-house audience at The Beaux Arts Trio's<br />\nconcert in Shriver Saturday night<br />\ncontained only a handful of<br />\nstudents.<br />\nThe concert was part of the<br /><br />\nShriver Hall Concert Series.

This is<br />\ncheaper than a night at the<br />\nmovies.<br />\nPoor publicity, you say?<br /><br />\nWrong you are. The posters have<br />\nbeen up advertising the concert<br />\nfor days.

What<br />\nmakes it different now is that instead of using other records simply as references or breaks, D.J.'s<br />\nare using records as the entire<br />\nbody of the song, adding only<br />\ndrums and bassline to distinguish<br />\ntheir song from another. The<br />\nD.J.'s art, then, is to cut and mix<br />\nthese other records into a collage<br />\nthat keeps the people's interest<br />\n(i.e. keep them dancing.)<br />\nIt's a competitive field. What<br />\nis fresh one week is nowhere the<br />\nnext.(Seems like every time you<br />\nturn around Warhol's 15 minutes<br />\nhas been compressed a little<br />\nmore.) New 12\" dance singles<br />\nare put out, and almost before they<br />\nreach the shops, some enterprising D.J. cuts up a piece of it and<br />\nputs it on his own record, which<br />\nin turn gets used in someone<br />\nelse's record. The cycle continues, accelerating with every<br />\nturn.<br />\nPart of what is causing this<br />\nspeed up is the advent of cheap ;<br />\ndigital samplers\u2014machines that<br />\ncan record a sound and play it<br />\nback with computer controlled<br />\naccuracy. Such devices are<br />\ngodsends to the D.J.'s but<br />\nnightmares for producers. In effect, they allow the D.J.'s to control the context of the music.

I am able to surrender<br />\ncompletely to the music without<br />\ngetting hung up on missed notes<br />\nor gauging degrees of tonal<br />\nquality.<br />\nSo you see, there is something<br />\nto be gained by going to these<br />\nconcerts.

For those who have not<br />\nyet had the pleasure, this is the<br />\nalbum for you. Hedges plays a<br />\nwide range of his songs, instrumentals and vocal numbers, as<br />\nwell as a few rather interesting<br />\ncovers. He is not what you call<br />\n\"your average guitar player.\"<br />\nHis innovative techniques involve<br />\nslapping and pounding the guitar<br />\nand an adrenalized punk-rock<br />\nthrasher. Highlights include the<br />\npoignant \"Woman of the<br />\nWorld,\" \"Silent Anticipations\"<br />\nand an extremely funky cover of<br />\nSheila E.'s hit, \"A Love<br />\nBizarre.\"<br />\nI could go on trying to convince<br />\nyou how great this music is. I fear<br />\nI may not have done it justice.<br />\nWorse, I fear I may have<br />\noverstepped my role as critic and<br />\nentered into the realm of the<br />\nfanatic.

Both writers take<br />\na spectator's viewpoint on their<br />\nsubjects: Boswell on baseball,<br />\nWill on politics.<br />\nWill's appeal to the educated<br />\nmasses rests on this sort of<br />\nwriting. Will does not claim any<br />\ninsider's right to Truth, yet he is<br />\ncapable of discussing a complex<br />\nissue, presidential politics, on a<br />\nlevel which anyone may understand. Will demystifies an often<br />\nmisunderstood issue by extending<br />\nanalogies of sports to politics.<br />\nThat Dizzy Dean, former pitcher<br />\nfor the St. Louis Cardinals,<br />\nshould have anything to say about<br />\nthe way we elect presidents may<br />\nastonish the reader at first, but it<br />\nis with this sort of comparative<br />\nanalysis that Will raises the<br /><br />\nGeorge F. Will<br />\nreader's interest in politics.<br />\nLike Boswell, Will believes<br />\nthat the more one knows about the<br />\nvariables of presidential politics<br />\n(or baseball, depending on the<br />\nauthor), one becomes astounded<br />\nby its complexities. It may not<br />\nsurprise, then, that Will called<br />\nstatistician Bill James' revolutionary mathematical observations of baseball statistics \"the<br />\nmost important scientific treatise<br />\nsince Newton's Principia.\"<br />\nWill's fascination with details and<br />\nstastistical analysis is probably<br />\nthe reason for his in-depth,<br />\nsometimes rambling, review of<br />\nvoting percentages in different<br />\ntates. It must be said, however,<br />\ntha Will's numbers are hardly<br />\nobvious, since the media has been<br />\nignorant of them so far.<br />\nWill's analysis of the '88<br />\npresidential race forms the<br />\npremise behind the book. But<br />\neven though Will reviews the<br />\nfacts necessary to understand the<br />\nupcoming election, he does not<br />\noffer a prediction of the outcome.<br />\nAs Will notes, political analysts<br />\nmay make the mistake, for instance, of declaring that the candidate who best imitates Ronald<br />\nReagan's telegenic attributes will<br />\nbe the winner in '88.

The<br />\nReagan candidacies, both in '80<br />\nand '84, were successful, Will<br />\nsays, because Reagan stressed an<br />\noverriding policy, an emotion,<br />\nwhich the electorate could readily absorb.

Though tremendous<br />\nsacrifices and academic pressures<br />\nare often placed upon the student,<br />\nsuch hardship sometimes is unnecessarily forced upon the individual by himself. In the opinion of Dr. John Gryder, the<br />\nhealth professions adviser and<br />\nprofessor of chemistry, the<br />\naverage Hopkins student worries<br />\ntoo much about gaining entrance<br />\ninto medical school. The national<br />\ntrend toward the medical profession has dropped among college<br />\nstudents, and some of the fears<br />\nassociated with entrance into<br />\nmedicine are unfounded.<br />\nA typical graduating class from<br />\nJHU includes some 150 to 160<br />\napplicants to medical school. In<br />\n1986, from this size group, all but<br />\none student with a grade point<br />\naverage above 3.2 gained acceptance to some school. Even the<br />\none remaining student was an exceptional case, as his stay at<br />\nHopkins had been for only three<br />\nyears and his failure to obtain entrance merely left him the option<br />\nof completing his senior year.<br />\nStudents with a cummulative<br />\nG.P.A. between 3.0 and 3.2<br />\nfound a 3 in 4 chance of entering<br />\nmedical school, and surprisingly,<br />\n58 percent of individuals with<br /><br />\nbelow 3.0 were accepted. Obviously, the anxiety over succeeding in the classroom is not<br />\njustified.<br />\nWhat then are the medical<br />\nschools looking for in the student? Dr. Gryder feels that a<br />\ntypical school will first examine<br />\nthe individual's grades and scores<br />\non the Medical College Admissions Test (MCAT). This may<br />\ncount for up to half of the application. It may be noted, however,<br />\nthat two schools, Hopkins and<br />\nRochester, do not require the<br />\nMCAT, but in honesty, neglecting to take these tests may be<br />\nhazardous, unless one assumes he<br />\nwill gain acceptance to such a<br />\nschool. The remaining criteria used to judge a student are recommendations, the interview, and<br />\nactivities.<br />\nextracurricular<br />\nGenerally, a quarter of the application is dependent upon the<br />\nrecommendations and activities,<br />\nand the remaining quarter is left<br />\nto the discretion of the interviewer. A medical institution is,<br />\naccording to Dr. Gryder, \"looking for motivation in a student, a<br />\nstudent who has demonstrated<br />\nconcern for other people,\" and<br />\none who has not \"done things just<br />\nto look good\" but rather has<br />\n\"done things that truly interest<br />\nhim.\" Schools also examine the<br />\nstudent's interaction with other<br />\npeople and seek maturity in an<br /><br />\nindividual. Simply put, Dr.<br />\nGryder believes that each interviewer \"has his ideal view of<br />\nwhat a physician should be and<br />\nmatches the student to this ideal.\"<br />\nThough medical schools may<br />\nseek a certain type of individual,<br />\nthere is the common belief that<br />\ncertain fields of undergraduate<br />\nstudy give the student some advantage over his or her peers.<br />\nBiology and chemistry are often<br />\nthought as the traditional premedical backgrounds. Students in<br />\nthese disciplines do tend to enter<br />\nthe medical schools, but again the<br />\nstudent must realize that such<br />\nfields of study are scienceintensive and consequently are<br />\nappropriate and beneficial for the<br />\nfirst two years of medical school.<br />\nThere is also the impression that<br />\nnon-science majors may have a<br />\nbetter chance of acceptance. Such<br />\na view may have been true once,<br />\nbut as this approach became more<br />\npopular, the advantage seems to<br />\nhave been lost. In Dr. Gryder's<br />\nopinion, the non-science major,<br />\nat a time when few in his or her<br />\ndiscipline actually applied to<br />\nmedical school, did hold some<br />\ngreater appeal to the interviewer.<br />\nIt is as if the interviewer would<br />\nmeet six or seven students who<br />\nwould discuss their research in<br />\n\"enzymatic crystallization\" and<br />\nthen chance upon the non-science<br />\nstudent who would discuss a book<br /><br />\nDr. John Gryder aids and assists medical school applicants as Health Pro<br />\nfessions Advisor<br />\nhe has read.

Sean Bramble<br />\nHere we are on the eve of<br />\nspring training, so I'll take this<br />\nopportunity to assess the 1988<br />\nrace. This will be a four-part article to be continued in the next<br />\nthree issues of the News-Letter, as<br />\nI'll be examining one division at<br />\na time.<br />\nHere's how I see the National<br />\nLeague West:<br />\n1. Cincinnati Reds. How many<br />\ntimes over the past few years<br />\nhave the Reds been picked to<br />\nfinish first? I don't know, but<br />\neach year they seem to finish<br />\nworse than predicted. Now that<br />\nthey've lost Dave Parker, people<br />\nare starting to assume that the<br />\nReds will finally slip the other<br />\nway. I disagree; I think it was a<br />\nheckuva time to trade the 36 yearold first baseman. His on-base<br />\npercentage last year was just<br />\nbarely over .300, his defensive<br />\nmobility is wretched, and even<br />\nhis arm isn't much good<br />\nanymore. Granted, the best prospect the Reds received in return<br />\nfor Parker was Jose Rijo (the A's<br />\nversion of a \"puzzle wrapped inside an enigma\"), but considering the state of the Reds' starting<br />\nstaff, I think it was a worthwhile<br />\ngamble. And don't forget that<br />\nthey've acquired Danny Jackson,<br />\none of the game's best pitchers.<br />\n2. San Francisco Giants. Picking the Giants to finish second<br />\nisn't my way of picking on the<br />\nteam, it's just my way of saying<br /><br />\nhow much I think of the Reds.<br />\nThe Giants are a solid club in<br />\nevery respect. But 1987 was just<br />\nanother example of a solid club<br />\nhaving everything break right for<br />\nit. I myself have doubts about<br />\nKevin Mitchell as a third<br />\nbaseman, about whether or not<br />\nRick Reuschel can do it another<br />\nyear, and about the entire pitching<br />\nstaff repeating its performance of<br />\nlast year. Sure, Roger Craig is a<br />\npitching genius; the Baltimore<br />\nOrioles once prided themselves<br />\non knowing a lot about pitching,<br />\ntoo.<br />\n3. Los Angeles Dodgers. The<br />\nfiring of Al Campanis was a<br />\nblessing in disguise for the<br />\nDodgers, for it gave them the opportunity to install a new GM,<br />\nFred Claire. Claire has been active, acquiring Sutton, Orosco,<br />\nGibson, Mike Davis, Jay Howell,<br />\nand Alfredo Griffin. Personally,<br />\nI think Gibson is the best of the<br />\npickups, but you can say that any<br />\nof the new Dodgers has helped fill<br />\na hole. But there's also a lot of<br />\ndiscontent in Tinseltown: Lasorda wants to be GM,Pedro doesn't<br />\nwant to be an outfielder, Pedro<br />\ndoesn't want to play anywhere<br />\nbut first base, Mike Marshall<br />\ndoesn't want to be moved from<br />\nfirst just for Pedro's sake. And<br />\nwho will play third for the<br />\nDodgers? Sax? Marshall? German Rivera? Steve Garvey? The<br />\nDodgers will be exciting and even<br />\ncontend, but I don't see them<br />\nwinning.<br /><br />\nCAMPUS NOTES<br />\nNOTES, from 28<br />\nAll welcome to an open talk on \"Hell<br />\nand Pain.\" Question and answer session afterward.

Houston Astros. As I said in<br />\nthe Giants comment, picking a<br />\nclub to finish lower than expected<br />\nisn't to denigrate the talents of the<br />\nclub, only to acknowledge that<br />\nthere are other good teams out<br />\nthere as well. Houston has Bill<br />\nDoran, Kevin Bass, Glenn Davis,<br />\nNolan Ryan, Mike Scott, and<br />\nDave Smith, plus the very<br />\ncapable Hal Lanier. But who will<br />\ncatch? And what is the left side<br />\nof the infield going to look like?<br />\nSo far, the Astros haven't offered<br />\nany good answers to those questions; instead, they have calmed<br />\nthemselves into thinking they can<br />\nwin with the talent nucleus they<br />\nalready have, propped up with a<br />\nfew retreads. That's a very<br />\ndangerous game to play.<br />\n5. San Diego Padres. A team<br />\nof great strengths and<br />\nweaknesses. In the strength column, the Padres can offer John<br />\nKruk, Tony Gwynn, Benito Santiago, and Eric Show. In the<br />\nweakness column, the Padres<br />\nhave Garry Templeton, Ed Whitson, losing Goose Gossage, and<br />\nacquiring Keith Moreland. I<br />\nmean, they picked up Moreland<br />\nbecause they needed power,<br />\nright? Well, away from Wrigley,<br />\nMoreland's homer totals have<br />\nbeen 3 (1984), 3 (1985), and 4<br />\n(1986). If you think he's a slugger, then you probably think<br />\nRafael Santana is a major league<br />\nballplayer, too.<br />\n6. Atlanta Braves.

They are known for frequenting bars. This week, I want you to name the bars where these celebs are often seen. For<br />\nbonus points you might want to name the shows, movies, books, or cities where these bars<br />\ncan be found. Get your entries to the News-Letter Saloon by Wednesday, Feb. 24th at 5 o'clock,<br />\nin order to make last call.<br />\nwell done 'zlings. Many entries. The QM was very impressed<br />\nwith the 'zlings. Many entries, many correct answers, many laughs. Due to the mature (and<br />\nyes, embarrassing) nature of the quiz, the Eds have pleaded with me not to run the answers.<br />\nHowever, some will be run, so as to satiate the readers. Last week was National Condom<br />\nWeek, All in the Family first showed full frontal nudity (while changing Joey's diapers),<br />\nand yes, believe it or not, there are two sizes for condoms, one sold in the States, and the<br />\nother sold in the Orient. Oh and by the way, we have winners this week. No, it's not those<br />\nsame guys who won the last two weeks, but then again anyone who knows them knows that<br />\nbetween the three of them, they know nothing on the subject. The winners were Chetan The<br />\nkhinky ghuy Kharod, and Micah The gloved one Jackson. Chongrats ghuys, come by to<br />\ncollect your prize during our business hours. And please redeem your coupons within two<br />\nweeks! Or else you lose da beer!!<br /><br />\nResults: Well, well, very<br /><br />\nP.S.: Well the QM misjudged the 'zlings twice this past week. He thought it was a waste<br />\nto give out presents in last week's News-Letter. What would the average student here do with<br />\na condom, anyway? Then as the QM crossed the campus, he saw condom wrappers<br />\neverywhere. He thought he was at a real school, but thought the least people could do was<br />\nwait until they were back in their rooms to use them. Misjudgement #1. Upon closer examination, it was apparent that these condoms were not opened. So,just as soon as the QM<br />\nwas happy to learn he was wrong about Hoppies, he realized he was in fact right. Misjudgement #2. Gang, make love, not litter. If you don't want a condom, give it, sell it, or throw<br />\nit away properly. Leaving them lying on the campus is no solution, although it would make<br />\nBlue Keys' job much easier.<br />\nBy the way, the predictions found in the Sports section in no way reflect those of yours<br />\ntruly. As in the past, the Offi,,-./QM predictions will be found in the Gala Baseball Quiz,<br />\nprinted one week after my Rotisserie Draft. That way, no one will throat me.<br />\nA last note, finally. The QM lied to you earlier, and the guilt is devastating. The Eds did<br />\nnot tell me I shouldn't print the answers.
