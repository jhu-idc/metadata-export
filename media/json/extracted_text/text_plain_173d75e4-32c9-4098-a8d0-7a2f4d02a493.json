Its members are and will<br />\nalways be upper classmen, it being<br />\ngenerally agreed that there is less<br />\nlikelihood on any mistake in the<br />\nchoice of men after their first year<br />\nin college, which is usually sufficient to bring out both good and<br />\n\u2022 bad points.<br />\nAt present seven of the nine fraternities represented on the interfraternity board, as well'as three<br />\nothers which have no chapters at<br />\nHopkins, have members in Sigma<br />\nChi Beta and .it is expected that<br />\nall will be represented directly<br />\nafter the election of new members,<br />\ndue to take place shortly, and to<br />\nadd some dozen men to the chapter roll. According to a provision<br />\nof the constitution, no more than<br />\nfour members of one fraternity<br />\nmay at the same time be active<br />\nmembers of the honorary society,<br />\nthus removing all possibility of<br />\none chapter gaining control.<br />\nContrary to views held* by some<br />\non the campus, Sigma Chi Beta is<br />\nto be in no way construed as to be<br />\nrunning in opposition to Omicron<br />\nDelta Kappa. Whereas 0. D.

Out of the seven events on the<br />\nprogram Hopkins'scored six' firsts and six seconds, Baxter of Swarthmore coming out ahead in the fancy dive and his teammate, McAllister, placing in the plunge. Coady finished the 220-yard swim in the<br />\n5, knocking 11/5 seconds off the old Hopkins record<br />\n/<br />\nfast time of 2.482<br />\nmade last year. In the plunge Hambleton bettered the old mark by<br />\n2 feet, while Reins bettered his old<br />\nfive feet six inches by plunging 591/<br />\n2 of a second.<br />\n/5 seconds for the back stroke by 1/<br />\nrecord of 271.<br />\n0 D K TO AWARD CUP<br />\nWill Honor Student Who Has Done<br />\nMost For Hopkins During College<br />\nLife\u2014Convention To Be Held<br />\n.At Lexington, Va.<br />\n<br />\nAt the last meeting ot Omicron<br />\nDelta Kappa last Thursday night<br />\nthe circle _decided to give a silver<br />\ncup as an award to the 6tudent<br />\nwho has done most for Hopkins<br />\nduring his college'course. The conditions of the award have not been<br />\ndfinitely dcided, but the object is<br />\nto recognize and reward tl..e most<br />\nconspicuous service to the University. A conimittee is looking into<br />\nthe best method of selecting the<br />\nrecipient of this honor and the<br />\nchoice of judges, as well as the<br />\nbasis of selection, will be decided<br />\nat the next meeting. The circle<br />\nis endeavoring to promote several<br />\nmethods of fostering activities,<br />\nand it is hoped that this prize will<br />\nincite interest and keen competition.<br />\nThe national convention of O.

Norman Keyes has been<br />\nelected to represent Hopkins and<br />\nDr. French, who is president of<br />\nthe society, will also attend. The<br />\nnext meeting has been postponed<br />\non account of examinations 'to Friday, February 11, at 12.30 o'clock.<br />\nThe list of charter members of<br />\nthe new fraternity follows: T.

The fancy diving came<br />\nnext and Baxter, of Swarthmore,<br />\nearned the decision over Call.<br />\nRowland won the 40-yard dash<br />\nwith room to spare, but Johnston<br />\nand Martin, of Swarthmore,<br />\nfought it out for second, with the<br />\nformer winning by inches. Early<br />\nin the 220 it was seen that Coady<br />\nwas hitting up a fast pace and he<br />\ndrew away from his competitors.<br />\nHe weakened toward the last, however, and Gould drew up, with a<br />\npretty finish between them resulting. In the plunge Hambleton<br />\nfailed by six inches to make the<br />\nlength of the pool, but he was far<br />\nahead of his nearest rival. At the<br />\nrequest of Swarthmore the breast<br />\nstroke was eliminated and the<br />\nback stroke swum in its place.<br />\nReins and \"Bob\" Hall finished this<br />\nin what seemed almost a dead<br />\nheat, but which the judges decided<br />\nwas not, Reins being given the decision. Swarthmore deserves great<br />\ncredit for carrying out this event,<br />\nas neither of her entrants had ap:<br />\nparently swum the back stroke before. The 100-yard swim finished<br />\nthe meet with Rowland and Buhrer, of Hopkins, nosing out Baker,<br />\nof Swarthmore.<br />\nThe support accorded the team<br />\nwas disgusting. The number of<br />\nstudents present could almost be<br />\ncounted on the fingers of both<br />\nhands and they received the announcements of the. breaking of<br />\nthe records with philosophical<br />\ncalm. It is hard for a team to do<br />\nits best if the student-body is not<br />\nbehind it, so it is hoped that every'body will turn out for the cOming<br />\nmeets.

President Trew Explains<br />\nDifficulties.<br />\n<br />\n(<br />\n<br />\nAll because of one woman the<br />\nDramatic Club has found it necessary to change the play for March<br />\n11 from \"Lady Windermere's Fan\"<br />\nto \"Arms and the Man,\" by George<br />\nBernard Shaw. It is probably not<br />\nSO much because of this\u2022 one<br />\nwoman as the lack of one since it<br />\nwas found impossible to find anywhere in the University an actor<br />\n\u2022to take the leading feminine role<br />\nof Mrs. Erlynne. There were several aspirants but just as in the<br />\ncase of casting Eurelia in \"Captain Jinks of the Horse Marine\"<br />\nthere were none who had the<br />\nnatural charms to put themselves<br />\nnaturally in the part and carry it<br />\nas Oscar Wilde has made. it.<br />\nThe new choice, \"Arms and the<br />\nMan,\" will have seven speaking<br />\nparts and several non-speaking<br />\nwhich will be filled by those who<br />\nhave shown up best in the tryouts<br />\nand rehearsals which have been<br />\ngoing on since the early part of<br />\nthe. year. The plav is in three acts<br />\nstaged in Bulgaria during the<br />\nSerbo-Bulgarian War of 1885 and<br />\ndepicts a romance involving officers of both sides.<br />\nBartus Trew, president of the<br />\nclub, in a letter to the NEWS-LETTER has made the following report<br />\non the change:<br />\nAs the University has been following with so much interest the<br />\nactivities of the Dramatic Club,<br />\nnot only in a general way but by<br />\nits allotment in the new nonathletic budget has shown a material<br />\ninterest, it is only fair that a<br />\nstatement should be made to the<br />\n<br />\nPIPES<br />\n<br />\nBASKETBALL GAMES .<br />\n\u2022<br />\nCANCELLED<br />\nThe Princeton basketball game<br />\nhas been called off and that with<br />\nVirginia indefinitely postponed<br />\nwith a possibility of playing it in<br />\nBaltimore.<br />\nUniversity for what must seem an<br />\napparent delay in the choice of a<br />\nplay as the major production for<br />\nthis year.<br />\nWhat may seem indecision is in<br />\nreality experimentation; which is<br />\nhi its very nature essential to play.<br />\nproducing. it is impossible to<br />\njudge of the ability of an actor<br />\nuntil lie has been tried out. It is<br />\nto be remembered that last year<br />\n.:t matic Club lost six experienced men by graduation and<br />\nwhen activities were again resumed this fall not only were the<br />\nofficers of the club but also Miss<br />\nWalter ignorant of the available<br />\nmaterial. Although nearly 50 men<br />\ntried out, it was found impossible<br />\nto cast the first play decided upon,<br />\n\"Captain Jinks,\" which was unfortunate both because it offered<br />\na large cast and because it embodied a little of the idea of musical comedy, an end toward which<br />\nthe club is striving. The second<br />\nchoice proved equally unsuccessful and our final selection has been<br />\nmade to fit our material, always<br />\nremembering that \"Arms and the<br />\nMan\" embodies all the literary<br />\nvalues and effects of the club's<br />\nformer production.<br />\nI may say still further the very<br />\nheavy expense involved in the pro-,<br />\nduction of many plays that could<br />\notherwise have been done precluded them, as the club is financially unable to stand a production<br />\n,f this type.<br />\nI am certain that the studentbody will agree with the Dramatic<br />\nClub in their final - action and<br />\ntherefore leave the advisability of<br />\nit to you all who witness \"Arms<br />\nand the Man\" at the Lyric on<br />\nMarch 11.<br />\nBAirrus TRIM, President.<br />\n<br />\n\"Eddie\" Hulburt Elected Honorary<br />\nPresident Of '23.<br />\n<br />\nDr. Edward Hulburt was<br />\nelected honorary class president<br />\nat a meeting of the Sophomore<br />\nclass held last Thursday at 12.20<br />\no'clock. .

After having<br />\ndefeated the quintet from the<br />\nPark Avenue School several weeks<br />\nago by a narrow margin at the<br />\nArmory and having gained a de<br />\neisive victory over the Severn<br />\nSchool last week, the Freshmen<br />\nwere confident of their third consecutive win in as many starts<br />\nwhen they lined up for action<br />\nWednesday evening, but the Quakers set a mark in the first half<br />\nwhich the first-year men did not<br />\npass nor even equal at any stage<br />\nof the game.<br />\nFrom the time the first whistle<br />\nblew every Quaker was in the fray<br />\nwith all his might and main and<br />\nthey fooght like Trojans, allowing<br />\nonly one point to be scored against<br />\nthem in the first half while they<br />\ntotaled 11, due mainly to the brilliant work of Berndt, who was<br />\neasily the individual star of the<br />\ngame, scoring 11 of the 15 points<br />\nwhich his team made in the entire game.<br />\nIn the second half the Freshmen<br />\ncame back strengthened; they<br />\nfought hard and it seemed as<br />\nthough they would win, gradually<br />\novercoming the lead which Friends<br />\nhad taken during the earlier<br />\nstages of the game,but the Quakers<br />\nproved equal to the occasion and<br />\nwhen time was called the score<br />\nstood 15 to 11 in their favor. In<br />\nthis period the \"Freshies\" scored<br />\n10 points to their opponents' 4,<br />\nwhich in itself is indicative of the<br />\nfact that the first-year men fought<br />\nand fought hard. Captain Strouse<br />\ndid not show up well in shooting<br />\nfouls, caging only two out of eight<br />\ntrials and making only one field<br />\ngoal.

R. W. WOOD GIVES nitely until the liquefaction temperature is reached. It is only re\" INTERESTING LECTURE<br />\nLiquefaction<br />\n<br />\nof<br />\n<br />\nGases Subject of<br />\n<br />\nTalk\u2014Illustrates Some<br />\n<br />\nof the<br />\n<br />\nQualities of Liquid Air.<br />\n<br />\n-<br />\n<br />\nLast Thursday, during the general assembly hour, Prof. Robert<br />\nW. Wood gave a most interesting<br />\nlecture on the liquefaction of gases<br />\nbefore an audience of students<br />\nwhich taxed the capacity of the<br />\nM. E. lecture-room. The lecture<br />\nwas arranged by Professor Bliss<br />\nmainly for the benefit of his<br />\nphysics classes, but the interest<br />\nof the subject and the reputation<br />\nof the speaker drew many in addition. Professor Wood is well<br />\nknown throughout the country for<br />\nthe wonderful work he did for the<br />\nGovernment on balloon gases during the war and his remarkable<br />\ndiscovery of the \"invisible eye,\"<br />\nWhich sees with ease colors in the<br />\nspectroscope which heretofore no<br />\none has known much about.<br />\nProfessor Wood opened his talk<br />\nWith a short discussion of the<br />\ntheory of the liquefaction of gases,<br />\ntelling of the early discoveries of<br />\nthe fact that they could be liquefied. Michael Faraday was the<br />\nfirst to realize that some oily<br />\ndrops, in a tube of chlorine which<br />\nhe had, were in reality liquid<br />\nchlorine. Professor Wood went<br />\non to tell of the first attempts to<br />\nliquefy other gases and the failures which resulted. It was not<br />\nuntil the apparatus now commonly used was thought of that the<br />\ngases most difficult to liquefy were<br />\nconquered. This apparatus depends on the fact that a gas cools<br />\nas it expands. The gas is first put<br />\nunder great pressure and then<br />\nPassed through a series of copper<br />\ncoils which allow it to expand.<br />\nThese coils are,in turn,surrounded<br />\nby an outer jacket, so that when<br />\nthe first of the gas comes out of<br />\nthe stopcock at the bottom it is<br />\ncooled probably 30 degrees below<br />\nroom temperature and passes up<br />\nbetween the coils and the jacket,<br />\nbringing the former to its temperature. Thus when the second portion of gas comes out it is reduced<br />\nto 60 degrees below room temperature. This is continued indefi-<br />\n<br />\ncently that helium, which requires<br />\nthe lowest temperature, has been<br />\nliquefied by first subcooling it<br />\nwith liquid air.<br />\nProfessor Wood next brought<br />\nout some liquid air and displayed \u2022<br />\nsome of its qualities. It was quite<br />\na surprise to many that the air<br />\ncan be kept a number of days in<br />\nreceptacles like thermos bottles.<br />\nAs the air was poured from vessel<br />\nto vessel it boiled and hissed, giving it quite a fearsome appearance.<br />\nProfessor Wood dropped alcohol<br />\nand mercury into it and they froze<br />\ninstantly. Flowers when dipped<br />\ninto it appeared the same, but<br />\ncrumbled to nothing at a touch.<br />\nProfessor Wood closed the lecture by taking some of the air<br />\ninto his mouth for a minute.

Nevertheless itismuch<br />\nbetter that an official statement<br />\nshould have been given out so as<br />\nto completely remove any lingering doubt which any one may have<br />\nentertained.<br />\nThe thing to do now is for every<br />\nman to get squarely behind the<br />\nStudent Council and back up the<br />\nhonor system to the limit. It is,<br />\nof course, the only way of Dinning<br />\nthings at a university. The hardest part of it for the average than<br />\nis the reporting of one of las f'1low-students whom he sees vioIt must be<br />\nlating the system.<br />\nrealized that this is practically as<br />\nimportant as not violating the system oneself.<br />\nIt should not be<br />\nthought of in the light of \"peachmg\" on a fellow or of being<br />\nsneaky. On the contrary, h is<br />\nsneaky if anyone sees cheating awl<br />\nfails to report the person Coing<br />\nSO. It is acknowledged that it<br />\ntakes the highest kind cr. moral<br />\n<br />\ncourage to do this, but we should<br />\nall try get it, in fact, we must all<br />\nget it if the honor system is to be<br />\na full success.<br />\nHONOR SYSTEM.<br />\n<br />\nCORONA<br />\n<br />\nJ.

In addition<br />\nto the college stars many of the<br />\nbest club and high school stars<br />\nwill be on hand for the competition.<br />\nThe seating arrangements will<br />\nprovide unusual facilities for a<br />\nclear view of the proceedings.<br />\nHomewood's circus seats will be<br />\nset up all around the 220-yard<br />\ntrack and one section at each end<br />\nwill be reserved for the contestants<br />\nso that they will not obstruct the<br />\nview of the spectators. These seats<br />\nand those in the first row of the<br />\nnorth and south balconies will set<br />\nthe enthusiast back $1.50, war tax<br />\nincluded. The second and third<br />\nrows in these balconies will tax<br />\ntheir occupants only $1, and the<br />\nmob can stand for a paltry 75<br />\ncents.<br />\nAmong the big feature races<br />\nwill be the renewal of the Varsity<br />\n1000-yard special, the South Atlantic collegiate mile relay championships, the Middle States mile<br />\nrelay championships, the Maryland Interscholastic mile relay<br />\nchampionship and the four-mile<br />\ninternational schoolboy relay between City College and Toronto.<br />\nThe Hopkins tearn is fast rounding into unusually good shape for<br />\nthis season of the year. The unusual number and high quality of<br />\nthe candidates make sure a good<br />\nshowing at the games at which<br />\nthey will act as hosts. It is highly<br />\nprobable that there will be few<br />\nraces in which two or three of<br />\nthe leading contenders are not<br />\nHopkins men. The weakness in<br />\nfield events is being remedied and<br />\nwith the appearance of a few more<br />\nweight-throwers and jumpers this<br />\nbranch of the sport should be as<br />\nstrong as the running side.<br />\nHonor System Is Live Topic.<br />\n<br />\nThe honor system continues to<br />\nbe the subject of discussion in<br />\nAmerican colleges. It has recently<br />\nbeen adopted in the military department of Colorado Agricultural<br />\nCollege by the students of Ohio<br />\nS tat e University, GustavusAdolphus College, Minnesota, and<br />\nValparaiso University, Indiana.<br />\nOther student bodies having the<br />\nsame under consideration are<br />\nBethany College, West Virginia;<br />\nCoe College, Iowa; University of<br />\nMichigan and Oklahoma Agricultural and Mechanical College.<br />\n<br />\nTryouts were held Friday to select an undergraudate of the University, who will be sent to the<br />\nUniversity of North Carolina in<br />\nMarch to represent Johns Hopkins<br />\nin the Annual Southern Oratorical<br />\nContest.<br />\nOut of twelve men who participated in the trials, C. I. T. Gould,<br />\nJr., was chosen as representative<br />\nand P. C. Williams as alternate.<br />\nTheir subjects were \"Business Reconstruction\" and \"The Restriction of Immigration,\" respectively.<br />\nThe Southern Oratorical League<br />\nis formed of seven universities,<br />\nnamely, Vanderbilt, Tennessee,<br />\nKentucky, Alabama, North Carolina, Virginia and Johns Hopkins.<br />\nA contest is held each year at one<br />\nof the competing colleges; where<br />\nspeeches not exceeding 20 'minutes in length are made dealing with subjects of current, political or social interest.<br />\nCash prizes are awarded for<br />\nfirst, second and third place.. Last<br />\nyear the prizes were $25, $15 and<br />\n$10.<br />\nThe trials for speakers to compete for the .Tocqueville Medal,<br />\nawarded by Baron Pierre de Couberten, will be held February 11<br />\nand the finals will be given during<br />\nassembly several weeks later. The<br />\nsubject for the year 1921 will be<br />\n\"France as a Colonial Power,\" and<br />\ncontestants will choose a subtopic<br />\nupon which they will speak for a<br />\nperiod of five minutes.<br />\n<br />\nUndergraduate Orchestra To Play At<br />\nStudent Assemblies.<br />\n<br />\nThe Undergraduate Orchestra,<br />\nunder the capable direction of<br />\n\"Mike\" Bowers, is rapidly acquiring a finished touch. The orchestra was inaugurated at the beginning of the collegiate year, when<br />\nit was evident that there .waFi sufficient talent among the students to<br />\njustify the formation of such an<br />\norganization and regular renearsals have been held every Thursday night since.<br />\nThe student orchestra has given<br />\nseveral public performances which<br />\nhas reflected favorably upon the<br />\norchestra and the University. A<br />\nrehearsal was recently given at<br />\nthe Baltimore City College, and<br />\nwas greatly appreciated by the<br />\naudience. The quality of the music<br />\nrendered by the orchestra at the<br />\nFreshmen-Sophomore debate was<br />\nmost creditable and added much<br />\nto the pleasure of the evening. The<br />\norchestra is now directing it activity in anticipation of its performance at the Dramatic Club<br />\nplay. The orchestra also is planning to play at a number of the<br />\ngeneral assemblies later in the<br />\nyear.<br />\nOn the whole the new niusical<br />\nbody at Hopkins has made mani-<br />\n<br />\nA name<br />\nthat means<br />\nthe best<br />\nin clothes<br />\nIn China a prince wears<br />\na mandarin coat.<br />\nIn Baltimore he wears<br />\nSlesingers shoes.<br />\n<br />\nCLOTHES<br />\n<br />\nSLESINGERS<br />\nOn Charles St.<br />\n216 North.<br />\n<br />\n211-213 E.

By far the major number<br />\nof games will be played at Homewood this year and, as stated in<br />\nthe NEWS-LETTER several weeks<br />\nago, there will be plenty of interval between each match so that<br />\npitchers will not be played out as<br />\nthey were \u2022 last season. For this<br />\nyear, even more than last, promises to see the University short of<br />\ntwirlers.<br />\nThe latest addition to the<br />\nschedule is a game with Dartmouth on April 2.

Its members are and will<br />\nalways be upper classmen, it being<br />\ngenerally agreed that there is less<br />\nlikelihood on any mistake in the<br />\nchoice of men after their first year<br />\nin college, which is usually sufficient to bring out both good and<br />\n\u2022 bad points.<br />\nAt present seven of the nine fraternities represented on the interfraternity board, as well'as three<br />\nothers which have no chapters at<br />\nHopkins, have members in Sigma<br />\nChi Beta and .it is expected that<br />\nall will be represented directly<br />\nafter the election of new members,<br />\ndue to take place shortly, and to<br />\nadd some dozen men to the chapter roll. According to a provision<br />\nof the constitution, no more than<br />\nfour members of one fraternity<br />\nmay at the same time be active<br />\nmembers of the honorary society,<br />\nthus removing all possibility of<br />\none chapter gaining control.<br />\nContrary to views held* by some<br />\non the campus, Sigma Chi Beta is<br />\nto be in no way construed as to be<br />\nrunning in opposition to Omicron<br />\nDelta Kappa. Whereas 0. D.

Out of the seven events on the<br />\nprogram Hopkins'scored six' firsts and six seconds, Baxter of Swarthmore coming out ahead in the fancy dive and his teammate, McAllister, placing in the plunge. Coady finished the 220-yard swim in the<br />\n5, knocking 11/5 seconds off the old Hopkins record<br />\n/<br />\nfast time of 2.482<br />\nmade last year. In the plunge Hambleton bettered the old mark by<br />\n2 feet, while Reins bettered his old<br />\nfive feet six inches by plunging 591/<br />\n2 of a second.<br />\n/5 seconds for the back stroke by 1/<br />\nrecord of 271.<br />\n0 D K TO AWARD CUP<br />\nWill Honor Student Who Has Done<br />\nMost For Hopkins During College<br />\nLife\u2014Convention To Be Held<br />\n.At Lexington, Va.<br /><br />\nAt the last meeting ot Omicron<br />\nDelta Kappa last Thursday night<br />\nthe circle _decided to give a silver<br />\ncup as an award to the 6tudent<br />\nwho has done most for Hopkins<br />\nduring his college'course. The conditions of the award have not been<br />\ndfinitely dcided, but the object is<br />\nto recognize and reward tl..e most<br />\nconspicuous service to the University. A conimittee is looking into<br />\nthe best method of selecting the<br />\nrecipient of this honor and the<br />\nchoice of judges, as well as the<br />\nbasis of selection, will be decided<br />\nat the next meeting. The circle<br />\nis endeavoring to promote several<br />\nmethods of fostering activities,<br />\nand it is hoped that this prize will<br />\nincite interest and keen competition.<br />\nThe national convention of O. D.<br />\nK. is to be held on February 5 at<br />\nLexington Va., where there is a<br />\ncircle in Washington and Lee University. Norman Keyes has been<br />\nelected to represent Hopkins and<br />\nDr. French, who is president of<br />\nthe society, will also attend. The<br />\nnext meeting has been postponed<br />\non account of examinations 'to Friday, February 11, at 12.30 o'clock.<br />\nThe list of charter members of<br />\nthe new fraternity follows: T.

The fancy diving came<br />\nnext and Baxter, of Swarthmore,<br />\nearned the decision over Call.<br />\nRowland won the 40-yard dash<br />\nwith room to spare, but Johnston<br />\nand Martin, of Swarthmore,<br />\nfought it out for second, with the<br />\nformer winning by inches. Early<br />\nin the 220 it was seen that Coady<br />\nwas hitting up a fast pace and he<br />\ndrew away from his competitors.<br />\nHe weakened toward the last, however, and Gould drew up, with a<br />\npretty finish between them resulting. In the plunge Hambleton<br />\nfailed by six inches to make the<br />\nlength of the pool, but he was far<br />\nahead of his nearest rival. At the<br />\nrequest of Swarthmore the breast<br />\nstroke was eliminated and the<br />\nback stroke swum in its place.<br />\nReins and \"Bob\" Hall finished this<br />\nin what seemed almost a dead<br />\nheat, but which the judges decided<br />\nwas not, Reins being given the decision. Swarthmore deserves great<br />\ncredit for carrying out this event,<br />\nas neither of her entrants had ap:<br />\nparently swum the back stroke before. The 100-yard swim finished<br />\nthe meet with Rowland and Buhrer, of Hopkins, nosing out Baker,<br />\nof Swarthmore.<br />\nThe support accorded the team<br />\nwas disgusting. The number of<br />\nstudents present could almost be<br />\ncounted on the fingers of both<br />\nhands and they received the announcements of the. breaking of<br />\nthe records with philosophical<br />\ncalm. It is hard for a team to do<br />\nits best if the student-body is not<br />\nbehind it, so it is hoped that every'body will turn out for the cOming<br />\nmeets.

President Trew Explains<br />\nDifficulties.<br /><br />\n(<br /><br />\nAll because of one woman the<br />\nDramatic Club has found it necessary to change the play for March<br />\n11 from \"Lady Windermere's Fan\"<br />\nto \"Arms and the Man,\" by George<br />\nBernard Shaw. It is probably not<br />\nSO much because of this\u2022 one<br />\nwoman as the lack of one since it<br />\nwas found impossible to find anywhere in the University an actor<br />\n\u2022to take the leading feminine role<br />\nof Mrs. Erlynne. There were several aspirants but just as in the<br />\ncase of casting Eurelia in \"Captain Jinks of the Horse Marine\"<br />\nthere were none who had the<br />\nnatural charms to put themselves<br />\nnaturally in the part and carry it<br />\nas Oscar Wilde has made. it.<br />\nThe new choice, \"Arms and the<br />\nMan,\" will have seven speaking<br />\nparts and several non-speaking<br />\nwhich will be filled by those who<br />\nhave shown up best in the tryouts<br />\nand rehearsals which have been<br />\ngoing on since the early part of<br />\nthe. year. The plav is in three acts<br />\nstaged in Bulgaria during the<br />\nSerbo-Bulgarian War of 1885 and<br />\ndepicts a romance involving officers of both sides.<br />\nBartus Trew, president of the<br />\nclub, in a letter to the NEWS-LETTER has made the following report<br />\non the change:<br />\nAs the University has been following with so much interest the<br />\nactivities of the Dramatic Club,<br />\nnot only in a general way but by<br />\nits allotment in the new nonathletic budget has shown a material<br />\ninterest, it is only fair that a<br />\nstatement should be made to the<br /><br />\nPIPES<br /><br />\nBASKETBALL GAMES .<br />\n\u2022<br />\nCANCELLED<br />\nThe Princeton basketball game<br />\nhas been called off and that with<br />\nVirginia indefinitely postponed<br />\nwith a possibility of playing it in<br />\nBaltimore.<br />\nUniversity for what must seem an<br />\napparent delay in the choice of a<br />\nplay as the major production for<br />\nthis year.<br />\nWhat may seem indecision is in<br />\nreality experimentation; which is<br />\nhi its very nature essential to play.<br />\nproducing. it is impossible to<br />\njudge of the ability of an actor<br />\nuntil lie has been tried out. It is<br />\nto be remembered that last year<br />\n.:t matic Club lost six experienced men by graduation and<br />\nwhen activities were again resumed this fall not only were the<br />\nofficers of the club but also Miss<br />\nWalter ignorant of the available<br />\nmaterial. Although nearly 50 men<br />\ntried out, it was found impossible<br />\nto cast the first play decided upon,<br />\n\"Captain Jinks,\" which was unfortunate both because it offered<br />\na large cast and because it embodied a little of the idea of musical comedy, an end toward which<br />\nthe club is striving. The second<br />\nchoice proved equally unsuccessful and our final selection has been<br />\nmade to fit our material, always<br />\nremembering that \"Arms and the<br />\nMan\" embodies all the literary<br />\nvalues and effects of the club's<br />\nformer production.<br />\nI may say still further the very<br />\nheavy expense involved in the pro-,<br />\nduction of many plays that could<br />\notherwise have been done precluded them, as the club is financially unable to stand a production<br />\n,f this type.<br />\nI am certain that the studentbody will agree with the Dramatic<br />\nClub in their final - action and<br />\ntherefore leave the advisability of<br />\nit to you all who witness \"Arms<br />\nand the Man\" at the Lyric on<br />\nMarch 11.<br />\nBAirrus TRIM, President.<br /><br />\n\"Eddie\" Hulburt Elected Honorary<br />\nPresident Of '23.<br /><br />\nDr. Edward Hulburt was<br />\nelected honorary class president<br />\nat a meeting of the Sophomore<br />\nclass held last Thursday at 12.20<br />\no'clock. .

R. W. WOOD GIVES nitely until the liquefaction temperature is reached. It is only re\" INTERESTING LECTURE<br />\nLiquefaction<br /><br />\nof<br /><br />\nGases Subject of<br /><br />\nTalk\u2014Illustrates Some<br /><br />\nof the<br /><br />\nQualities of Liquid Air.<br /><br />\n-<br /><br />\nLast Thursday, during the general assembly hour, Prof. Robert<br />\nW. Wood gave a most interesting<br />\nlecture on the liquefaction of gases<br />\nbefore an audience of students<br />\nwhich taxed the capacity of the<br />\nM. E. lecture-room. The lecture<br />\nwas arranged by Professor Bliss<br />\nmainly for the benefit of his<br />\nphysics classes, but the interest<br />\nof the subject and the reputation<br />\nof the speaker drew many in addition. Professor Wood is well<br />\nknown throughout the country for<br />\nthe wonderful work he did for the<br />\nGovernment on balloon gases during the war and his remarkable<br />\ndiscovery of the \"invisible eye,\"<br />\nWhich sees with ease colors in the<br />\nspectroscope which heretofore no<br />\none has known much about.<br />\nProfessor Wood opened his talk<br />\nWith a short discussion of the<br />\ntheory of the liquefaction of gases,<br />\ntelling of the early discoveries of<br />\nthe fact that they could be liquefied. Michael Faraday was the<br />\nfirst to realize that some oily<br />\ndrops, in a tube of chlorine which<br />\nhe had, were in reality liquid<br />\nchlorine. Professor Wood went<br />\non to tell of the first attempts to<br />\nliquefy other gases and the failures which resulted. It was not<br />\nuntil the apparatus now commonly used was thought of that the<br />\ngases most difficult to liquefy were<br />\nconquered. This apparatus depends on the fact that a gas cools<br />\nas it expands. The gas is first put<br />\nunder great pressure and then<br />\nPassed through a series of copper<br />\ncoils which allow it to expand.<br />\nThese coils are,in turn,surrounded<br />\nby an outer jacket, so that when<br />\nthe first of the gas comes out of<br />\nthe stopcock at the bottom it is<br />\ncooled probably 30 degrees below<br />\nroom temperature and passes up<br />\nbetween the coils and the jacket,<br />\nbringing the former to its temperature. Thus when the second portion of gas comes out it is reduced<br />\nto 60 degrees below room temperature. This is continued indefi-<br /><br />\ncently that helium, which requires<br />\nthe lowest temperature, has been<br />\nliquefied by first subcooling it<br />\nwith liquid air.<br />\nProfessor Wood next brought<br />\nout some liquid air and displayed \u2022<br />\nsome of its qualities. It was quite<br />\na surprise to many that the air<br />\ncan be kept a number of days in<br />\nreceptacles like thermos bottles.<br />\nAs the air was poured from vessel<br />\nto vessel it boiled and hissed, giving it quite a fearsome appearance.<br />\nProfessor Wood dropped alcohol<br />\nand mercury into it and they froze<br />\ninstantly. Flowers when dipped<br />\ninto it appeared the same, but<br />\ncrumbled to nothing at a touch.<br />\nProfessor Wood closed the lecture by taking some of the air<br />\ninto his mouth for a minute. This<br />\nfeat elicited much applause.<br /><br />\nYOUNG MEN'S OVERCOATS REDUCED!<br />\nULSTERETTES AND BELTED MODELS\u2014<br />\nGREYS, BROWNS AND MIXTURES\u2014<br /><br />\nNOW $29.50, $37.50 and $47.50<br />\nBaltimore's Best Store<br /><br />\nHOCHSCHILD,KOHN gc Co.<br />\nHoward and Lexington<br /><br />\nFURNITURE OF QUALITY<br />\nand individuality is offered here at prices that are not<br />\nand cannot be underquoted by any house at any time.<br />\n11 Besides the reputation of an old-established firm<br />\nis back of each sale with a guarantee.<br /><br />\nJOHN C.

Nevertheless itismuch<br />\nbetter that an official statement<br />\nshould have been given out so as<br />\nto completely remove any lingering doubt which any one may have<br />\nentertained.<br />\nThe thing to do now is for every<br />\nman to get squarely behind the<br />\nStudent Council and back up the<br />\nhonor system to the limit. It is,<br />\nof course, the only way of Dinning<br />\nthings at a university. The hardest part of it for the average than<br />\nis the reporting of one of las f'1low-students whom he sees vioIt must be<br />\nlating the system.<br />\nrealized that this is practically as<br />\nimportant as not violating the system oneself.<br />\nIt should not be<br />\nthought of in the light of \"peachmg\" on a fellow or of being<br />\nsneaky. On the contrary, h is<br />\nsneaky if anyone sees cheating awl<br />\nfails to report the person Coing<br />\nSO. It is acknowledged that it<br />\ntakes the highest kind cr. moral<br /><br />\ncourage to do this, but we should<br />\nall try get it, in fact, we must all<br />\nget it if the honor system is to be<br />\na full success.<br />\nHONOR SYSTEM.<br /><br />\nCORONA<br /><br />\nJ.

In addition<br />\nto the college stars many of the<br />\nbest club and high school stars<br />\nwill be on hand for the competition.<br />\nThe seating arrangements will<br />\nprovide unusual facilities for a<br />\nclear view of the proceedings.<br />\nHomewood's circus seats will be<br />\nset up all around the 220-yard<br />\ntrack and one section at each end<br />\nwill be reserved for the contestants<br />\nso that they will not obstruct the<br />\nview of the spectators. These seats<br />\nand those in the first row of the<br />\nnorth and south balconies will set<br />\nthe enthusiast back $1.50, war tax<br />\nincluded. The second and third<br />\nrows in these balconies will tax<br />\ntheir occupants only $1, and the<br />\nmob can stand for a paltry 75<br />\ncents.<br />\nAmong the big feature races<br />\nwill be the renewal of the Varsity<br />\n1000-yard special, the South Atlantic collegiate mile relay championships, the Middle States mile<br />\nrelay championships, the Maryland Interscholastic mile relay<br />\nchampionship and the four-mile<br />\ninternational schoolboy relay between City College and Toronto.<br />\nThe Hopkins tearn is fast rounding into unusually good shape for<br />\nthis season of the year. The unusual number and high quality of<br />\nthe candidates make sure a good<br />\nshowing at the games at which<br />\nthey will act as hosts. It is highly<br />\nprobable that there will be few<br />\nraces in which two or three of<br />\nthe leading contenders are not<br />\nHopkins men. The weakness in<br />\nfield events is being remedied and<br />\nwith the appearance of a few more<br />\nweight-throwers and jumpers this<br />\nbranch of the sport should be as<br />\nstrong as the running side.<br />\nHonor System Is Live Topic.<br /><br />\nThe honor system continues to<br />\nbe the subject of discussion in<br />\nAmerican colleges. It has recently<br />\nbeen adopted in the military department of Colorado Agricultural<br />\nCollege by the students of Ohio<br />\nS tat e University, GustavusAdolphus College, Minnesota, and<br />\nValparaiso University, Indiana.<br />\nOther student bodies having the<br />\nsame under consideration are<br />\nBethany College, West Virginia;<br />\nCoe College, Iowa; University of<br />\nMichigan and Oklahoma Agricultural and Mechanical College.<br /><br />\nTryouts were held Friday to select an undergraudate of the University, who will be sent to the<br />\nUniversity of North Carolina in<br />\nMarch to represent Johns Hopkins<br />\nin the Annual Southern Oratorical<br />\nContest.<br />\nOut of twelve men who participated in the trials, C. I. T. Gould,<br />\nJr., was chosen as representative<br />\nand P. C. Williams as alternate.<br />\nTheir subjects were \"Business Reconstruction\" and \"The Restriction of Immigration,\" respectively.<br />\nThe Southern Oratorical League<br />\nis formed of seven universities,<br />\nnamely, Vanderbilt, Tennessee,<br />\nKentucky, Alabama, North Carolina, Virginia and Johns Hopkins.<br />\nA contest is held each year at one<br />\nof the competing colleges; where<br />\nspeeches not exceeding 20 'minutes in length are made dealing with subjects of current, political or social interest.<br />\nCash prizes are awarded for<br />\nfirst, second and third place.. Last<br />\nyear the prizes were $25, $15 and<br />\n$10.<br />\nThe trials for speakers to compete for the .Tocqueville Medal,<br />\nawarded by Baron Pierre de Couberten, will be held February 11<br />\nand the finals will be given during<br />\nassembly several weeks later. The<br />\nsubject for the year 1921 will be<br />\n\"France as a Colonial Power,\" and<br />\ncontestants will choose a subtopic<br />\nupon which they will speak for a<br />\nperiod of five minutes.<br /><br />\nUndergraduate Orchestra To Play At<br />\nStudent Assemblies.<br /><br />\nThe Undergraduate Orchestra,<br />\nunder the capable direction of<br />\n\"Mike\" Bowers, is rapidly acquiring a finished touch. The orchestra was inaugurated at the beginning of the collegiate year, when<br />\nit was evident that there .waFi sufficient talent among the students to<br />\njustify the formation of such an<br />\norganization and regular renearsals have been held every Thursday night since.<br />\nThe student orchestra has given<br />\nseveral public performances which<br />\nhas reflected favorably upon the<br />\norchestra and the University. A<br />\nrehearsal was recently given at<br />\nthe Baltimore City College, and<br />\nwas greatly appreciated by the<br />\naudience. The quality of the music<br />\nrendered by the orchestra at the<br />\nFreshmen-Sophomore debate was<br />\nmost creditable and added much<br />\nto the pleasure of the evening. The<br />\norchestra is now directing it activity in anticipation of its performance at the Dramatic Club<br />\nplay. The orchestra also is planning to play at a number of the<br />\ngeneral assemblies later in the<br />\nyear.<br />\nOn the whole the new niusical<br />\nbody at Hopkins has made mani-<br /><br />\nA name<br />\nthat means<br />\nthe best<br />\nin clothes<br />\nIn China a prince wears<br />\na mandarin coat.<br />\nIn Baltimore he wears<br />\nSlesingers shoes.<br /><br />\nCLOTHES<br /><br />\nSLESINGERS<br />\nOn Charles St.<br />\n216 North.<br /><br />\n211-213 E. Baltimore St.<br />\nHopkins Twirlers To Meet Dartmouth.<br /><br />\nThe baseball schedule for the<br />\nspring season is shaping up well<br />\nand promises to be one of the best<br />\nthat Hopkins has had for several<br />\nyears. By far the major number<br />\nof games will be played at Homewood this year and, as stated in<br />\nthe NEWS-LETTER several weeks<br />\nago, there will be plenty of interval between each match so that<br />\npitchers will not be played out as<br />\nthey were \u2022 last season. For this<br />\nyear, even more than last, promises to see the University short of<br />\ntwirlers.<br />\nThe latest addition to the<br />\nschedule is a game with Dartmouth on April 2.
