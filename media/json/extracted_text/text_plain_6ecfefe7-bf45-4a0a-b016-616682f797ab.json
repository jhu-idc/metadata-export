This the the first<br />\nmatch ever scheduled between these<br />\ntwo universities. Although the<br />\ncross-country team has had easy<br />\nvictories over its competitors so<br />\nfar this season, it faces a hard struggle when it meets Columbia. Not<br />\nmuch is known about the team from<br />\nNew York as no meets have taken<br />\nplace by which a comparison could<br />\nbe made. However, their first man,<br />\nHagen, an all-American two-miler<br />\nof last year has only been beaten<br />\nonce.

He has<br />\nnow fully recovered and is expected<br />\nto place regularly in the coming<br />\nmeets. Besides these two, there are<br />\nother veterans such as Emerson,<br />\nWaters and Miller who should also<br />\nprove a great help in keeping Hopkins cross-country men in the lead.<br />\nA fair number of the yearlings<br />\nare trying out for the team.

A petition was sent in<br />\nto Dean Berry recently asking that<br />\nthe Barn be allowed to continue<br />\nbusiness, under the supervision of<br />\n\"Doc\" Adams. This petition was<br />\nsigned by 165 Hopkins men. Nevertheless, it came to naught because<br />\nof this reason: When the Levering<br />\nHall cafeteria came on the campus<br />\nthe proprietors were assured that<br />\nno competition on the Hopkins<br />\nCampus would be permitted. For<br />\nthis reason the petition expressing<br />\nthe feelings of the Campus had to<br />\nbe disregarded.<br />\nThe Barn was the scene of many<br />\na happy time for the older sudents<br />\nof the University. It especially<br />\nbrings back memories of the \"Freshman Regulation\" days. For those<br />\nwho don't know the meaning of this<br />\nterm, we are speaking of the days<br />\nwhen cruel persecution of the freshmen, for not wearing black ties, for<br />\nwearing garters, going without his<br />\nbutton or cap, or for not attending<br />\nfootball games and so on and so<br />\nforth.<br />\nThe Student Council actually<br />\nused to permit the Sophs to use<br />\nlong, wooden paddles, sometimes<br />\npunctured with small round holes,<br />\nto force the frosh to obey these<br />\nrules.

The coach expects<br />\nto take the whole squad on the trip<br />\nand to give all the men an opportunity to play. The yearling team,<br />\nthough handicapped by the loss of<br />\none of its star players through an<br />\ninjury, has rallied and is confident<br />\nof victory. Some of the outstanding<br />\nplayers who will probably start the<br />\ngame are: Davis, Henderson, Cook,<br />\nSeitz and Davidson.

This the the first<br />\nmatch ever scheduled between these<br />\ntwo universities. Although the<br />\ncross-country team has had easy<br />\nvictories over its competitors so<br />\nfar this season, it faces a hard struggle when it meets Columbia. Not<br />\nmuch is known about the team from<br />\nNew York as no meets have taken<br />\nplace by which a comparison could<br />\nbe made.

A petition was sent in<br />\nto Dean Berry recently asking that<br />\nthe Barn be allowed to continue<br />\nbusiness, under the supervision of<br />\n\"Doc\" Adams. This petition was<br />\nsigned by 165 Hopkins men. Nevertheless, it came to naught because<br />\nof this reason: When the Levering<br />\nHall cafeteria came on the campus<br />\nthe proprietors were assured that<br />\nno competition on the Hopkins<br />\nCampus would be permitted. For<br />\nthis reason the petition expressing<br />\nthe feelings of the Campus had to<br />\nbe disregarded.<br />\nThe Barn was the scene of many<br />\na happy time for the older sudents<br />\nof the University.
