It is the result of motions made by representatives Chuck Crowell and John Sanborn at the Council's meeting last Monday.<br />\nTo the Inter-Fraternity Council:<br />\nThe question concerning discrimination in fraternities<br />\nwas brought before the Student Council and discussed. It was<br />\nconcluded that while the Student Council is opposed to discrimination in any form or organization on or off the campus,<br />\nfraternities, as private social organizations, are independent of<br />\nthe student governmental structure. Therefore the Council<br />\nhas no formal coercive power over them.<br />\nRecent social trends can not be ignored, however, and<br />\nwe would urge the fraternity system to be aware of its responsibilities as a representative of the University. If the<br />\npolicy of national fraternities prohibits acceptance of all<br />\nstudents, then our local chapters should do all in their power<br />\nto reverse that policy at the earliest possible date.<br />\n<br />\nConcert tickets will be on sale<br />\non Tuesday, October 20, in the<br />\nYMCA office, for $.75 and $1.00.<br />\n<br />\nThe Student Council<br />\n<br />\nSC Condemns Discrimination<br />\nThe Student Council placed itself publicly against discrimination among Johns Hopkins organizations, whether on or off<br />\ncampus, in last Monday's meeting.<br />\nThe Council's action followed<br />\ndiscussion on a report by IFC<br />\nrepresentative Jon Shanser concerning discrimination among<br />\ncampus fraternities. As reported<br />\nby Shanser, Phi Gamma Delta is<br />\nthe only Hopkins fraternity still<br />\nmaintaining discrimination on<br />\nthe basis of race or religion. In<br />\nthis case the discrimination is<br />\nagainst, Negroes and Orthodox<br />\nJews.<br />\nNo Waiver<br />\nPhi Gam reported to the IFC<br />\nthat it will not get a waiver from<br />\nits national and doesn't want the<br />\nUniversity to help them get one.<br />\nThe fraternity feels that University interference in this area<br />\nWould be unprecedented and is<br />\nWilling to take its chances<br />\nagainst its occurrence. As the<br />\n<br />\nmatter now stands they are willing to go into second semester<br />\nrushing without the waiver and<br />\ntake their chances with the<br />\nfreshmen. The IFC took no action after hearing this position.<br />\nPhi Gam currently thinks that<br />\nneither they nor their national<br />\ncan do anything about the situation. They cite alumni pressure<br />\nas the reason for their stand.<br />\nOught To Do Something<br />\nIt was in relation to this, and<br />\nto the failure of the IFC to do<br />\nanything further that the council made its resolution.<br />\nDick Benzinger said, \"I think<br />\nthe Student Council ought to do<br />\nsomething, things having gone<br />\nthis far.\" At the same ,time, the<br />\nCouncil felt that its powers were<br />\nlimited in this area. Hence the<br />\nmotion for the public letter was<br />\nadopted.<br />\nDorm Discrimination<br />\nA freshman representative, living in Gildersleeve, asked the<br />\nCouncil why Negro residents in<br />\n<br />\nthe freshman dorms seemed to<br />\nbe paired together. He wanted to<br />\nknow if this were entirely by accident.<br />\nDSRC representative Benzinger replied that in roommate<br />\nselection compatibility is important and hence there is a<br />\npolicy of pairing Negroes when<br />\npossible; otherwise they are<br />\nmatched with Jewish boys, under<br />\nthe theory that they would be<br />\nleast likely to object. Roommate<br />\nselection is in the hands of Mrs.<br />\nVan Norman.<br />\nIn other business, the Council<br />\nheard arguments from a pretty<br />\nTowson State mathematics major urging Hopkins to join the<br />\nInter Collegiate Council. The<br />\nICC is an organization comprised<br />\nof representatives from local colleges for coordinating activities<br />\namong its members. The Council voted against membership at<br />\nits previous meeting and the<br />\nspokeswoman's figures generally<br />\nfell on deaf ears.<br />\n<br />\npolice and the courts are becoming increasingly tired of having<br />\nto deal with the problem of sanitation at Hopkins' fraternity<br />\nhouses.<br />\nCited were a number of instances from the past few years<br />\nwhen neighbors lodged complaints about excessive garbage<br />\nand trash on the grounds of<br />\ncertain frat houses. These unsanitary conditions encouraged<br />\nrat infestation, according to police, to such a degree that one<br />\nhouse last year was required to<br />\nhave its entire grounds dug up<br />\nand treated by rat exterminators.<br />\nCann Explains<br />\nIn defense of Delta Upsilon,<br />\nCann stated that the summer<br />\nresidents of the fraternity h J.:se<br />\ndid not attempt to keep the<br />\ngrounds in order, even after inspections by the Sanitation Department, nor did they inform<br />\neither Cann or any other regular<br />\nmember of the summer inspections.<br />\nHe also claimed that the city<br />\ntrash collectors refused to take<br />\naway all of the rubbish gathered<br />\ntogether by the D.U. members.<br />\nWhen a private concern agreed<br />\nto pick up the balance and then<br />\ndid not do so, the uncovered<br />\ntrash remained on the street<br />\novernight, resulting in the lodging of a complaint.<br />\nWant Amicable Settlement<br />\n\"Garbage and trash must be<br />\nplaced in proper containers with<br />\ntight-fitting lids,\" one officer<br />\nstated. He added that the police<br />\n\"want to settle this amicably,\"<br />\nbut that further violations will<br />\nbe promptly prosecuted. A copy<br />\nof the notice sent to the fraternity from the Sanitation Department would also be sent to the<br />\nPresident of the University.<br />\nJon Harlow, president of the<br />\nIFC. noted that a neighborhood<br />\nis always opposed to the opening<br />\nof a frat house, is extremely sensitive to its movements, and is<br />\nready to complain if given only<br />\nslight provocation.<br />\nHe also recognized the responsibilities of the frateinity in a<br />\nresidential section, saying, \"The<br />\nresidents have lived in the neighborhood before the arrival of the<br />\nfraternity and must live there<br />\nafter it is gone. The fraternities<br />\nmust always exercise respect and<br />\nconsideration for their neighbors.\"<br />\nThe IFC presently has in operation an inspection system,<br />\nwhereby the vice-president makes<br />\nregular checks of fraternity<br />\ngrounds, while Harlow makes<br />\nunannounced spot inspections.<br />\nAny fraternity found in an unsanitary condition will be fined<br />\n$100 and will be brought before<br />\nthe IFC Judicial Board.<br />\nHarlow also plans to pass a<br />\nlaw requiring that during the<br />\nsummer a house must be either<br />\nclosed down or be placed under<br />\nthe supervision of the fraternity<br />\npresident or a responsible alumnus.<br />\n<br />\nRepublican Presidential candidate Barry M.

Mr. Johnson stressed throughout the need<br />\nfor a national unity. This was in<br />\nkeeping with<br />\nhis campaign<br />\ntheme of rising above partisan<br />\npolitics and being president of<br />\n\"all the people\".<br />\nPartisan Speech<br />\nMr. Goldwater, on the other<br />\nhand, is expected to speak in a<br />\nmuch more partisan vein. He will<br />\nlikely attack expanding federal<br />\ngovernment, unbalanced budgets,<br />\nBobby Baker, and Billie Sod<br />\nEstes.<br />\nSenator Goldwater is now considered by most political \"experts\" to have little chance of<br />\nwinning election to the presidency, and it is even conceded by<br />\nmany that he will run far behind<br />\nlocal candidates in many areas<br />\nof the country.<br />\nHowever, experts feel that his<br />\nchances have been considerably<br />\nimproved by the arrest tnis week<br />\nof a top aide in the Johnson<br />\nAdministration, Walter W.

The Student Council has investigated the clause,<br />\nthe Interfraternity Council has discussed it, and the<br />\nNews-Letter has publicized it.<br />\nAll parties acknowledge that Phi Gam could not<br />\nvoluntarily dissociate itself from the clause, even if it<br />\nwished to do so. A Phi Gam chapter can obtain a dispensation from the national fraternity headquarters only if<br />\nits university's or college's administration notifies the<br />\nnational that unless the dispensation is granted the<br />\nchapter will lose all campus privileges.<br />\nConfronted with these facts, the IFC has decided<br />\nthat the matter should he dropped and that Phi Gam<br />\nshould be left to face whatever consequences may arise<br />\nfrom the public knowledge of its clause.<br />\nThe Student Council went a hit further when it<br />\ndeclared its opposition to all forms of discrimination on<br />\ncampus. The Council also noted that it has no coercive<br />\npower over fraternities.<br />\nBoth IFC and Student Council leaders have expressed fear of intervention by the Administration.<br />\nThere are some fraternity men who are opposed to<br />\ndiscriminatory clauses, but who also fear that if the<br />\nAdministration were to step in now and notify the Phi<br />\nGam national that the Hopkins chapter must be given a<br />\ndispensation, it would be setting a precedent for further,<br />\nperhaps unwarranted, Administration interference.<br />\nFear of Administration action is understandable,<br />\nhut it cannot be said that such action mould he unprecedented. In the spring of 1962 a group of Administration and faculty leaders emerged from a secret<br />\ntwo (lay meeting to tell students of sweeping revisions<br />\nof undergraduate life that they had adopted. Included<br />\nin the revisions was an announcement that fraternities<br />\nwould henceforth rush in the spring rather than in the<br />\nfall. Like every other part of the group's report, the<br />\nfraternity section was dreamt up without consulting any<br />\nstudents. Such action by the Administration was blatant<br />\ninterference.<br />\nWhy, then, worry about a precedent that has already been set? A problem has been brought out that<br />\nstudents cannot solve themselves. Their only recourse<br />\nis to the Administration.<br />\nThe Administration might be reluctant to act,<br />\nclaiming that a fraternity's choice of members is its<br />\nown business. The Phi Gam national itself follows this<br />\nreasoning. In a recent issue of the fraternity magazine,<br />\nthe national urged chapters to \"make it clear that selfdetermination, not 'discrimination' is the issue.\" When,<br />\nhowever, a clause is interpreted to mean that neither<br />\nNegroes nor Orthodox Jews can he pledged, it is difficult to believe that the issue can he anything but diserimination.<br />\nThe Administration must intervene.<br />\n<br />\nHopkins Law School?<br />\nIn an interview with the Baltimore Sun published<br />\nlast Saturday, Dr. Eisenhower expressed hope for \"a<br />\nlaw school characterized by research as other graduate<br />\nschools are,\" and intimated that one would be located<br />\nat the Homewood but for the lack of $10,000,000.<br />\nThough these statements from another man might be<br />\nshrugged off as pipe-dreaming, one aware of our president's silent and sure administrative fashion and knowing that he is not at all given to idle conjecture can<br />\nonly conclude that the feasibility of such a school will<br />\nbe fully investigated, contingent upon which fund raising may be instigated.<br />\nMoney, it seems, is the only obstacle. The fact<br />\nthat Maryland does not need another source of practicing lawyers is no real objection to the school for<br />\n\"creative research\" in the law, as Dr. Eisenhower envisions it. Such an approach is, of course, the hallmark<br />\nof the Hopkins orientation in all matters, and was suggested here by the short life of the Institute of Law<br />\nwhich operated at the Homewood from 1928 until it<br />\ndied in the depression of 1933. One observer described<br />\nthe aim of that organization as to \"furnish to those<br />\nwhose function it is to make or expound the law landmarks by which they can chart their course.\"<br />\nAn addition of this sort, particularly at a time of<br />\nevolution toward excellence in the social sciences here,<br />\nwould go far towards establishing Hopkins as an outstanding force in the understanding of matters governmental and humane, and would compliment well our<br />\nprogress in those sciences which have made reconsidera'ion of governmental and humane values necessary.<br />\n<br />\nMR.

Mr. Whitehill, a<br />\ngraduate student in the Hopkins<br />\nWriting Seminars, looks beneath<br />\nthe superficial crust of prosperity<br />\nand production to examine the<br />\nhuman element. What he finds<br />\nis not pleasant.<br />\nOur society, as Mr. Whitehill<br />\nsees it., is the first in all history<br />\nto be devoted to the use of production as an end, rather than<br />\nas a means to an end. He sees<br />\noUr country as a nation \"given<br />\nto gadgetry.\" A real materialism,<br />\nhe feels, would be hard to criticize if it made folks happy, but<br />\nwe are afflicted with a \"mock<br />\nmaterialism\" that cannot be justified. As evidence, he points to<br />\nDetroit's \"8,000,000-car year\"; to<br />\nhim, the emphasis is all wrong,<br />\nThe question being asked is not<br />\n\"What do the people need?\" but<br />\nrather \"How many cars can we<br />\nsell?\" This is just one illustration of the aimlessness, pointlessness, and \"lack of conscience\" of<br />\nthe modern, non-academic society. This tall, handsome writer<br />\nsays that it is \"obviously an<br />\nimmature civilization that devotes its best minds and most of<br />\nits efforts to chicanery.\"<br />\nWrites From Personal Experience<br />\nJoseph Whitehill writes from<br />\npersonal experience. While working as an electrical engineer,<br />\nafter graduating from Harvard<br />\nand the University of Tulsa, he<br />\nhad ample opportunity to observe<br />\n\"the less savory aspects\" of our<br />\nindustrial machine.

To those Westerners<br />\nPresent whose sense of aesthetics<br />\nhas developed beyond the stage<br />\nof class associations, the concert<br />\nwas a truly beautiful and enlightening emotional experience.<br />\nTo the nearly fifty percent of<br />\nthe audience that was Indian the<br />\nconcert must have meant many<br />\nOther things as well.<br />\nThe music of India is at once<br />\nVery different from ours and yet<br />\nnot quite so different as I once<br />\nhad thought. It is not based on<br />\nChord structure but rather on<br />\nMelodic line, drones, and comPlex rhythms. The harmony is<br />\nderived from the interplay of the<br />\nMelody and the drone strings in<br />\nthe same manner as the Scottish<br />\nPipes but with more drones and<br />\nin much more intricate and subtle ways. Indian music nevertheless is far more versatile than<br />\nours because it uses many different scales rather than just one<br />\nor two. Instead of thirteen steps<br />\nPer octave, why not seven or<br />\neighteen? On Sunday, however,<br />\nMr. Shankar was kind to our uneducated ears and played music<br />\nUsing only a thirteen equal step<br />\nscale although he left out the<br />\nhalf step above the tonic and<br />\nthe sixth of our scale. If he had<br />\nUsed others, nearly every note<br />\nwould have sounded out of tune<br />\nto us. Since there is no distinction between major and minor<br />\nscales he would often switch from<br />\nUsing a primarily major to a<br />\nMinor and back again causing<br />\nstrange intervals and surprising<br />\neffects to Western ears.<br />\nThe tone of the sitar itself is<br />\neerie and beautiful and sweet.<br />\nThe instrument has about six<br />\nstrings on which the melody is<br />\nPlayed plus several drone strings<br />\n<br />\nand nineteen unplayed strings<br />\nbelow the bridgelike sliding<br />\nfrets\u2014one string for each note<br />\nof the scale being used which<br />\nsimply resonates sympathetically. The twang in the tone comes<br />\nfrom the design of the nut on<br />\n<br />\nThe total effect was wonderful.<br />\nThe urgency of the drones, the<br />\nincense from the stage, the delicate force of the sitar and the<br />\nintensity of the rhythms we were<br />\nunable to follow made those of<br />\nus who were there very grateful<br />\nto the \"Y\" for having gambled<br />\nonce more on the intellectual<br />\ncuriosity and aesthetic interest<br />\nof the Hopkins student body.<br />\nRAVI SHANKAR<br />\n<br />\nthe bridge at the lower end of<br />\nthe instrument.

As Klarner led us<br />\nthrough, over, under and about<br />\nthe construction workers at the<br />\nhalf-finished building, he gave<br />\nus a running commentary of dimensions, facts and figures of<br />\nthe center.<br />\nThe single largest room in the<br />\nplace is that in which the swimming areas are found.

For instance, swimmers in lanes one and six will be<br />\nflanked by ropes on both sides,<br />\nrather than by rope on one side<br />\nand the wall of the pool on the<br />\nother.

It is the result of motions made by representatives Chuck Crowell and John Sanborn at the Council's meeting last Monday.<br />\nTo the Inter-Fraternity Council:<br />\nThe question concerning discrimination in fraternities<br />\nwas brought before the Student Council and discussed. It was<br />\nconcluded that while the Student Council is opposed to discrimination in any form or organization on or off the campus,<br />\nfraternities, as private social organizations, are independent of<br />\nthe student governmental structure. Therefore the Council<br />\nhas no formal coercive power over them.<br />\nRecent social trends can not be ignored, however, and<br />\nwe would urge the fraternity system to be aware of its responsibilities as a representative of the University. If the<br />\npolicy of national fraternities prohibits acceptance of all<br />\nstudents, then our local chapters should do all in their power<br />\nto reverse that policy at the earliest possible date.<br /><br />\nConcert tickets will be on sale<br />\non Tuesday, October 20, in the<br />\nYMCA office, for $.75 and $1.00.<br /><br />\nThe Student Council<br /><br />\nSC Condemns Discrimination<br />\nThe Student Council placed itself publicly against discrimination among Johns Hopkins organizations, whether on or off<br />\ncampus, in last Monday's meeting.<br />\nThe Council's action followed<br />\ndiscussion on a report by IFC<br />\nrepresentative Jon Shanser concerning discrimination among<br />\ncampus fraternities. As reported<br />\nby Shanser, Phi Gamma Delta is<br />\nthe only Hopkins fraternity still<br />\nmaintaining discrimination on<br />\nthe basis of race or religion. In<br />\nthis case the discrimination is<br />\nagainst, Negroes and Orthodox<br />\nJews.<br />\nNo Waiver<br />\nPhi Gam reported to the IFC<br />\nthat it will not get a waiver from<br />\nits national and doesn't want the<br />\nUniversity to help them get one.<br />\nThe fraternity feels that University interference in this area<br />\nWould be unprecedented and is<br />\nWilling to take its chances<br />\nagainst its occurrence. As the<br /><br />\nmatter now stands they are willing to go into second semester<br />\nrushing without the waiver and<br />\ntake their chances with the<br />\nfreshmen. The IFC took no action after hearing this position.<br />\nPhi Gam currently thinks that<br />\nneither they nor their national<br />\ncan do anything about the situation. They cite alumni pressure<br />\nas the reason for their stand.<br />\nOught To Do Something<br />\nIt was in relation to this, and<br />\nto the failure of the IFC to do<br />\nanything further that the council made its resolution.<br />\nDick Benzinger said, \"I think<br />\nthe Student Council ought to do<br />\nsomething, things having gone<br />\nthis far.\" At the same ,time, the<br />\nCouncil felt that its powers were<br />\nlimited in this area. Hence the<br />\nmotion for the public letter was<br />\nadopted.<br />\nDorm Discrimination<br />\nA freshman representative, living in Gildersleeve, asked the<br />\nCouncil why Negro residents in<br /><br />\nthe freshman dorms seemed to<br />\nbe paired together. He wanted to<br />\nknow if this were entirely by accident.<br />\nDSRC representative Benzinger replied that in roommate<br />\nselection compatibility is important and hence there is a<br />\npolicy of pairing Negroes when<br />\npossible; otherwise they are<br />\nmatched with Jewish boys, under<br />\nthe theory that they would be<br />\nleast likely to object. Roommate<br />\nselection is in the hands of Mrs.<br />\nVan Norman.<br />\nIn other business, the Council<br />\nheard arguments from a pretty<br />\nTowson State mathematics major urging Hopkins to join the<br />\nInter Collegiate Council. The<br />\nICC is an organization comprised<br />\nof representatives from local colleges for coordinating activities<br />\namong its members. The Council voted against membership at<br />\nits previous meeting and the<br />\nspokeswoman's figures generally<br />\nfell on deaf ears.<br /><br />\npolice and the courts are becoming increasingly tired of having<br />\nto deal with the problem of sanitation at Hopkins' fraternity<br />\nhouses.<br />\nCited were a number of instances from the past few years<br />\nwhen neighbors lodged complaints about excessive garbage<br />\nand trash on the grounds of<br />\ncertain frat houses. These unsanitary conditions encouraged<br />\nrat infestation, according to police, to such a degree that one<br />\nhouse last year was required to<br />\nhave its entire grounds dug up<br />\nand treated by rat exterminators.<br />\nCann Explains<br />\nIn defense of Delta Upsilon,<br />\nCann stated that the summer<br />\nresidents of the fraternity h J.:se<br />\ndid not attempt to keep the<br />\ngrounds in order, even after inspections by the Sanitation Department, nor did they inform<br />\neither Cann or any other regular<br />\nmember of the summer inspections.<br />\nHe also claimed that the city<br />\ntrash collectors refused to take<br />\naway all of the rubbish gathered<br />\ntogether by the D.U. members.<br />\nWhen a private concern agreed<br />\nto pick up the balance and then<br />\ndid not do so, the uncovered<br />\ntrash remained on the street<br />\novernight, resulting in the lodging of a complaint.<br />\nWant Amicable Settlement<br />\n\"Garbage and trash must be<br />\nplaced in proper containers with<br />\ntight-fitting lids,\" one officer<br />\nstated. He added that the police<br />\n\"want to settle this amicably,\"<br />\nbut that further violations will<br />\nbe promptly prosecuted. A copy<br />\nof the notice sent to the fraternity from the Sanitation Department would also be sent to the<br />\nPresident of the University.<br />\nJon Harlow, president of the<br />\nIFC. noted that a neighborhood<br />\nis always opposed to the opening<br />\nof a frat house, is extremely sensitive to its movements, and is<br />\nready to complain if given only<br />\nslight provocation.<br />\nHe also recognized the responsibilities of the frateinity in a<br />\nresidential section, saying, \"The<br />\nresidents have lived in the neighborhood before the arrival of the<br />\nfraternity and must live there<br />\nafter it is gone. The fraternities<br />\nmust always exercise respect and<br />\nconsideration for their neighbors.\"<br />\nThe IFC presently has in operation an inspection system,<br />\nwhereby the vice-president makes<br />\nregular checks of fraternity<br />\ngrounds, while Harlow makes<br />\nunannounced spot inspections.<br />\nAny fraternity found in an unsanitary condition will be fined<br />\n$100 and will be brought before<br />\nthe IFC Judicial Board.<br />\nHarlow also plans to pass a<br />\nlaw requiring that during the<br />\nsummer a house must be either<br />\nclosed down or be placed under<br />\nthe supervision of the fraternity<br />\npresident or a responsible alumnus.<br /><br />\nRepublican Presidential candidate Barry M.

The Student Council has investigated the clause,<br />\nthe Interfraternity Council has discussed it, and the<br />\nNews-Letter has publicized it.<br />\nAll parties acknowledge that Phi Gam could not<br />\nvoluntarily dissociate itself from the clause, even if it<br />\nwished to do so. A Phi Gam chapter can obtain a dispensation from the national fraternity headquarters only if<br />\nits university's or college's administration notifies the<br />\nnational that unless the dispensation is granted the<br />\nchapter will lose all campus privileges.<br />\nConfronted with these facts, the IFC has decided<br />\nthat the matter should he dropped and that Phi Gam<br />\nshould be left to face whatever consequences may arise<br />\nfrom the public knowledge of its clause.<br />\nThe Student Council went a hit further when it<br />\ndeclared its opposition to all forms of discrimination on<br />\ncampus. The Council also noted that it has no coercive<br />\npower over fraternities.<br />\nBoth IFC and Student Council leaders have expressed fear of intervention by the Administration.<br />\nThere are some fraternity men who are opposed to<br />\ndiscriminatory clauses, but who also fear that if the<br />\nAdministration were to step in now and notify the Phi<br />\nGam national that the Hopkins chapter must be given a<br />\ndispensation, it would be setting a precedent for further,<br />\nperhaps unwarranted, Administration interference.<br />\nFear of Administration action is understandable,<br />\nhut it cannot be said that such action mould he unprecedented. In the spring of 1962 a group of Administration and faculty leaders emerged from a secret<br />\ntwo (lay meeting to tell students of sweeping revisions<br />\nof undergraduate life that they had adopted. Included<br />\nin the revisions was an announcement that fraternities<br />\nwould henceforth rush in the spring rather than in the<br />\nfall. Like every other part of the group's report, the<br />\nfraternity section was dreamt up without consulting any<br />\nstudents. Such action by the Administration was blatant<br />\ninterference.<br />\nWhy, then, worry about a precedent that has already been set? A problem has been brought out that<br />\nstudents cannot solve themselves. Their only recourse<br />\nis to the Administration.<br />\nThe Administration might be reluctant to act,<br />\nclaiming that a fraternity's choice of members is its<br />\nown business. The Phi Gam national itself follows this<br />\nreasoning. In a recent issue of the fraternity magazine,<br />\nthe national urged chapters to \"make it clear that selfdetermination, not 'discrimination' is the issue.\" When,<br />\nhowever, a clause is interpreted to mean that neither<br />\nNegroes nor Orthodox Jews can he pledged, it is difficult to believe that the issue can he anything but diserimination.<br />\nThe Administration must intervene.<br /><br />\nHopkins Law School?<br />\nIn an interview with the Baltimore Sun published<br />\nlast Saturday, Dr. Eisenhower expressed hope for \"a<br />\nlaw school characterized by research as other graduate<br />\nschools are,\" and intimated that one would be located<br />\nat the Homewood but for the lack of $10,000,000.<br />\nThough these statements from another man might be<br />\nshrugged off as pipe-dreaming, one aware of our president's silent and sure administrative fashion and knowing that he is not at all given to idle conjecture can<br />\nonly conclude that the feasibility of such a school will<br />\nbe fully investigated, contingent upon which fund raising may be instigated.<br />\nMoney, it seems, is the only obstacle. The fact<br />\nthat Maryland does not need another source of practicing lawyers is no real objection to the school for<br />\n\"creative research\" in the law, as Dr. Eisenhower envisions it. Such an approach is, of course, the hallmark<br />\nof the Hopkins orientation in all matters, and was suggested here by the short life of the Institute of Law<br />\nwhich operated at the Homewood from 1928 until it<br />\ndied in the depression of 1933. One observer described<br />\nthe aim of that organization as to \"furnish to those<br />\nwhose function it is to make or expound the law landmarks by which they can chart their course.\"<br />\nAn addition of this sort, particularly at a time of<br />\nevolution toward excellence in the social sciences here,<br />\nwould go far towards establishing Hopkins as an outstanding force in the understanding of matters governmental and humane, and would compliment well our<br />\nprogress in those sciences which have made reconsidera'ion of governmental and humane values necessary.<br /><br />\nMR.

Mr. Whitehill, a<br />\ngraduate student in the Hopkins<br />\nWriting Seminars, looks beneath<br />\nthe superficial crust of prosperity<br />\nand production to examine the<br />\nhuman element. What he finds<br />\nis not pleasant.<br />\nOur society, as Mr. Whitehill<br />\nsees it., is the first in all history<br />\nto be devoted to the use of production as an end, rather than<br />\nas a means to an end. He sees<br />\noUr country as a nation \"given<br />\nto gadgetry.\" A real materialism,<br />\nhe feels, would be hard to criticize if it made folks happy, but<br />\nwe are afflicted with a \"mock<br />\nmaterialism\" that cannot be justified. As evidence, he points to<br />\nDetroit's \"8,000,000-car year\"; to<br />\nhim, the emphasis is all wrong,<br />\nThe question being asked is not<br />\n\"What do the people need?\" but<br />\nrather \"How many cars can we<br />\nsell?\" This is just one illustration of the aimlessness, pointlessness, and \"lack of conscience\" of<br />\nthe modern, non-academic society. This tall, handsome writer<br />\nsays that it is \"obviously an<br />\nimmature civilization that devotes its best minds and most of<br />\nits efforts to chicanery.\"<br />\nWrites From Personal Experience<br />\nJoseph Whitehill writes from<br />\npersonal experience. While working as an electrical engineer,<br />\nafter graduating from Harvard<br />\nand the University of Tulsa, he<br />\nhad ample opportunity to observe<br />\n\"the less savory aspects\" of our<br />\nindustrial machine.

To those Westerners<br />\nPresent whose sense of aesthetics<br />\nhas developed beyond the stage<br />\nof class associations, the concert<br />\nwas a truly beautiful and enlightening emotional experience.<br />\nTo the nearly fifty percent of<br />\nthe audience that was Indian the<br />\nconcert must have meant many<br />\nOther things as well.<br />\nThe music of India is at once<br />\nVery different from ours and yet<br />\nnot quite so different as I once<br />\nhad thought. It is not based on<br />\nChord structure but rather on<br />\nMelodic line, drones, and comPlex rhythms. The harmony is<br />\nderived from the interplay of the<br />\nMelody and the drone strings in<br />\nthe same manner as the Scottish<br />\nPipes but with more drones and<br />\nin much more intricate and subtle ways. Indian music nevertheless is far more versatile than<br />\nours because it uses many different scales rather than just one<br />\nor two. Instead of thirteen steps<br />\nPer octave, why not seven or<br />\neighteen? On Sunday, however,<br />\nMr. Shankar was kind to our uneducated ears and played music<br />\nUsing only a thirteen equal step<br />\nscale although he left out the<br />\nhalf step above the tonic and<br />\nthe sixth of our scale. If he had<br />\nUsed others, nearly every note<br />\nwould have sounded out of tune<br />\nto us. Since there is no distinction between major and minor<br />\nscales he would often switch from<br />\nUsing a primarily major to a<br />\nMinor and back again causing<br />\nstrange intervals and surprising<br />\neffects to Western ears.<br />\nThe tone of the sitar itself is<br />\neerie and beautiful and sweet.<br />\nThe instrument has about six<br />\nstrings on which the melody is<br />\nPlayed plus several drone strings<br /><br />\nand nineteen unplayed strings<br />\nbelow the bridgelike sliding<br />\nfrets\u2014one string for each note<br />\nof the scale being used which<br />\nsimply resonates sympathetically. The twang in the tone comes<br />\nfrom the design of the nut on<br /><br />\nThe total effect was wonderful.<br />\nThe urgency of the drones, the<br />\nincense from the stage, the delicate force of the sitar and the<br />\nintensity of the rhythms we were<br />\nunable to follow made those of<br />\nus who were there very grateful<br />\nto the \"Y\" for having gambled<br />\nonce more on the intellectual<br />\ncuriosity and aesthetic interest<br />\nof the Hopkins student body.<br />\nRAVI SHANKAR<br /><br />\nthe bridge at the lower end of<br />\nthe instrument.

As Klarner led us<br />\nthrough, over, under and about<br />\nthe construction workers at the<br />\nhalf-finished building, he gave<br />\nus a running commentary of dimensions, facts and figures of<br />\nthe center.<br />\nThe single largest room in the<br />\nplace is that in which the swimming areas are found.
