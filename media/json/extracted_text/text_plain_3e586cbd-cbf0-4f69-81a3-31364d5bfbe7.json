Some said it was<br />\nin honor of the representatives<br />\nelected to the Board of Governors<br />\nfrom that entry, sort of an election celebration. Several baskets<br />\nof over-ripe apples and an incalculable amount of water were consumed. Undoubtedly, it was the<br />\nbest combat of its kind in the history of the dormitory. It was different from any other battle, in<br />\nthat following the encounter everyone joined in cleaning up the mess.<br />\nA real feeling of fellowship was<br />\npromoted.<br />\nThe arrangement of separate, independent entries in the dormitory<br />\nis excellent. The value of this system, an English one, was admirably<br />\nillustrated Monday evening. Residents in the other entries were not<br />\nonly undisturbed by the apple affair<br />\nbut were not even aware of it.<br />\nContinued on Page 3, Col. 1<br /><br />\nA. H.
