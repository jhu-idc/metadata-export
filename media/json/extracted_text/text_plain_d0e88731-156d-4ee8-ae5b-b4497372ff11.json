He said \"The late Dr. Osler<br />\nis reputed to have said that after a<br />\nman reaches forty he should be<br />\nchloroformed.'.' This remark is interesting for two reasons : for the<br />\nremarkable vitality of the legend<br />\nthat makes it a commonplace in the<br />\nthought of a student born some<br />\nyears after the event; and for the<br />\ngenerous expansion of Dr. Osier's<br />\nwhimsey with the years.<br />\nOf course Dr. Osler said nothing<br />\nof the sort. Venerable as forty<br />\nmay seem to undergraduates and<br />\nmuch as some of their instructors<br />\nmav 'seem to them to deserve<br />\neuthanasia, nobody thinks the<br />\nworld would be better off for such<br />\na wholesale termination of the professional career. I heard Dr. Osler's address and remember it well.<br />\n_One did not easily forget the man<br />\nor his words. He was deliveringFebruary 22, 1905-his public fare- \u00b7<br />\nwell to his Hopkins colleag-ues before leaving to become Regius Professor at Oxford; and he adopted<br />\na lighter mood and tone to hide the<br />\nfeeling of sorrow that was inevitable in such a parting. After some<br />\nhalf-serious talk about the desirability of frequent changes in academic<br />\nfaculties, he confessed to two fixed<br />\nideas, \"harmless obsessions\" with. which he bored his friends : the<br />\n\"comparative uselessness o( men<br />\nabove 40\u00b7 years of age\" and \"the<br />\nuselessness of men above 60 years<br />\nof \u2022age and the incalculable benefit<br />\nit would be in commercial, political,<br />\na:1d professional life if, as a matte'\u00b7<br />\nof course\u00b7 men stopped work at ti1is<br />\nage.\" The chloroform legend is<br />\nbased on the following:<br />\n\"In th~t charming novel, The<br />\nFixed Period, Anthony Trollope<br />\ndiscitsses the practical advantages in<br />\nmodern life of a return to this ancient usage, and the pk1t hinges on<br />\nthe admirable scheme \u00b7Of a co:lege<br />\ninto which \u00b7at sixty men retired for<br />\na \u00b7 year on contemplation before a<br />\npeaceful departure by chloroform.<br />\nThat incalculable benefits might<br />\nfollow such a scheme is apparent to<br />\nany one who, like myself, is nearing\u00b7<br />\nthe limit, and who has \"made a careful study of the calamities which<br />\nmay befall men during the seventh<br />\nand eighth decades.\"<br />\nThe newspapers made a sensation<br />\nof this and mauy old men-to Osier's distress-took it seriously and<br />\n\u00b7 kit hurt by the news that a famou;<br />\nphysician thought they were useless<br />\nand ought to be chloroformed.<br />\nBefore he turned to the serious<br />\npart of bis address the speaker aliowed himself one more jest. \"The<br />\nteacher's life should have three<br />\nperiods-study until 25, investigation until 40, profession until 60, at<br />\nwhich age I would have him retired on a double allowance.\" May<br />\nI rnggest that you have v0u:\u00b7 reporter try that suggestion on the<br />\nnext professor to be interviewed on<br />\nhis birthday?

He said \"The late Dr. Osler<br />\nis reputed to have said that after a<br />\nman reaches forty he should be<br />\nchloroformed.'.' This remark is interesting for two reasons : for the<br />\nremarkable vitality of the legend<br />\nthat makes it a commonplace in the<br />\nthought of a student born some<br />\nyears after the event; and for the<br />\ngenerous expansion of Dr. Osier's<br />\nwhimsey with the years.<br />\nOf course Dr. Osler said nothing<br />\nof the sort. Venerable as forty<br />\nmay seem to undergraduates and<br />\nmuch as some of their instructors<br />\nmav 'seem to them to deserve<br />\neuthanasia, nobody thinks the<br />\nworld would be better off for such<br />\na wholesale termination of the professional career. I heard Dr. Osler's address and remember it well.<br />\n_One did not easily forget the man<br />\nor his words. He was deliveringFebruary 22, 1905-his public fare- \u00b7<br />\nwell to his Hopkins colleag-ues before leaving to become Regius Professor at Oxford; and he adopted<br />\na lighter mood and tone to hide the<br />\nfeeling of sorrow that was inevitable in such a parting. After some<br />\nhalf-serious talk about the desirability of frequent changes in academic<br />\nfaculties, he confessed to two fixed<br />\nideas, \"harmless obsessions\" with. which he bored his friends : the<br />\n\"comparative uselessness o( men<br />\nabove 40\u00b7 years of age\" and \"the<br />\nuselessness of men above 60 years<br />\nof \u2022age and the incalculable benefit<br />\nit would be in commercial, political,<br />\na:1d professional life if, as a matte'\u00b7<br />\nof course\u00b7 men stopped work at ti1is<br />\nage.\" The chloroform legend is<br />\nbased on the following:<br />\n\"In th~t charming novel, The<br />\nFixed Period, Anthony Trollope<br />\ndiscitsses the practical advantages in<br />\nmodern life of a return to this ancient usage, and the pk1t hinges on<br />\nthe admirable scheme \u00b7Of a co:lege<br />\ninto which \u00b7at sixty men retired for<br />\na \u00b7 year on contemplation before a<br />\npeaceful departure by chloroform.<br />\nThat incalculable benefits might<br />\nfollow such a scheme is apparent to<br />\nany one who, like myself, is nearing\u00b7<br />\nthe limit, and who has \"made a careful study of the calamities which<br />\nmay befall men during the seventh<br />\nand eighth decades.\"<br />\nThe newspapers made a sensation<br />\nof this and mauy old men-to Osier's distress-took it seriously and<br />\n\u00b7 kit hurt by the news that a famou;<br />\nphysician thought they were useless<br />\nand ought to be chloroformed.<br />\nBefore he turned to the serious<br />\npart of bis address the speaker aliowed himself one more jest. \"The<br />\nteacher's life should have three<br />\nperiods-study until 25, investigation until 40, profession until 60, at<br />\nwhich age I would have him retired on a double allowance.\" May<br />\nI rnggest that you have v0u:\u00b7 reporter try that suggestion on the<br />\nnext professor to be interviewed on<br />\nhis birthday?
