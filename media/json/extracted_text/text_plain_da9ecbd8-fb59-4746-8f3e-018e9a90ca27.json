No one denies that for<br />\nyears he has been unconventional and even radical<br />\nin style and content, which characteristics have very<br />\njustly contributed to his popular appeal. On that<br />\nscore we join in the respect and admiration which the<br />\npublic has accorded him.<br />\nBut throughout practically his whole career his<br />\nremarks have been offered in the spirit of a certain<br />\nethical code; he has been courteous and gentlemanly<br />\neven when most rabid, and there is little proof of his<br />\nhaving spoken in poor taste. Outspoken, certainly;<br />\nbut in the manner of the court jester, not as the<br />\nboorish Saxon thane.<br />\nHe most obviously lapsed from good taste and<br />\ngood sense, however, when, in his recent Evening Sun<br />\narticles on the lynching, he painted President Ames<br />\nin a false light, namely, as a sympathizer with the<br />\nSomerset County murderers. His criticism of Dr.<br />\nAmes, which led him to observe uncouthly that sending an ear to the President would be appropriate, was<br />\nbased upon a letter which President Ames wrote to<br />\nthe editor of the Saulisbury Times, at the latter's request, in which he stated that he had no fault to find<br />\nwith the civilization of the Eastern Shore, and had<br />\n\"often said he would like to live there.\"<br />\nHow any man in the full possession of his senses<br />\ncan find pro-lynching sentiments in a letter of that<br />\ntenor is not apparent. Quite evidently the President<br />\nof the Hopkins was declining to make any public<br />\ndeclaration of his opinion and merely stated, in passing, that, from the slight association which he had had<br />\nwith respectable families on the Shore, it is a fine<br />\nplace. Certainly, anyone claiming as little knowledge<br />\nof the place as that would not commit himself to any<br />\nopinion, one way or the other, particularly when that<br />\nperson is as experienced in matters of public interest<br />\nas Dr. Ames. Mr. Mencken overstepped himself in<br />\nimputing partisanship on the basis of that meager,<br />\nnon-comittal letter.<br />\nNor did the President line himself and the faculty<br />\non the side of the lynchers when he also said that<br />\nthe opinions of Dr. Mitchell were not necessarily the<br />\nopinions of the whole faculty. That is not a \"repudiation\", as Mr. Mencken is pleased to term it, of Dr.<br />\nMitchell's ideas. It merely leaves the rest of the staff<br />\nfree to take individual stands upon the matter. It is<br />\nundeniably the duty of the president of a university<br />\nto make it clear that a particular act is not one of<br />\n<br />\nThe Reign Of Despondency<br />\nWriting today upon current political, social, and<br />\neconomic matters is colored by a spirit which has<br />\nprobably never before made itself felt to such an extent by contributors to American periodicals. It is<br />\nmore than an undercurrent of pessimism\u2014that feeling<br />\nat least implies a background of opinion about the<br />\nsituation prevailing. It is rather a pervading sense<br />\nof futility, inadequacy, incompetence to meet the exigencies of a chaotic system.<br />\nPep-talking and enthusiasm have long since deserted us. The Hearstian supplications to the noble<br />\nmanhood of America to \"stand shoulder-to-shoulder<br />\nto fend off the spectre of destruction\" have given way<br />\nto partly resentful picking and unsettled dissatisfaction.

No one denies that for<br />\nyears he has been unconventional and even radical<br />\nin style and content, which characteristics have very<br />\njustly contributed to his popular appeal. On that<br />\nscore we join in the respect and admiration which the<br />\npublic has accorded him.<br />\nBut throughout practically his whole career his<br />\nremarks have been offered in the spirit of a certain<br />\nethical code; he has been courteous and gentlemanly<br />\neven when most rabid, and there is little proof of his<br />\nhaving spoken in poor taste. Outspoken, certainly;<br />\nbut in the manner of the court jester, not as the<br />\nboorish Saxon thane.<br />\nHe most obviously lapsed from good taste and<br />\ngood sense, however, when, in his recent Evening Sun<br />\narticles on the lynching, he painted President Ames<br />\nin a false light, namely, as a sympathizer with the<br />\nSomerset County murderers. His criticism of Dr.<br />\nAmes, which led him to observe uncouthly that sending an ear to the President would be appropriate, was<br />\nbased upon a letter which President Ames wrote to<br />\nthe editor of the Saulisbury Times, at the latter's request, in which he stated that he had no fault to find<br />\nwith the civilization of the Eastern Shore, and had<br />\n\"often said he would like to live there.\"<br />\nHow any man in the full possession of his senses<br />\ncan find pro-lynching sentiments in a letter of that<br />\ntenor is not apparent. Quite evidently the President<br />\nof the Hopkins was declining to make any public<br />\ndeclaration of his opinion and merely stated, in passing, that, from the slight association which he had had<br />\nwith respectable families on the Shore, it is a fine<br />\nplace. Certainly, anyone claiming as little knowledge<br />\nof the place as that would not commit himself to any<br />\nopinion, one way or the other, particularly when that<br />\nperson is as experienced in matters of public interest<br />\nas Dr. Ames. Mr. Mencken overstepped himself in<br />\nimputing partisanship on the basis of that meager,<br />\nnon-comittal letter.<br />\nNor did the President line himself and the faculty<br />\non the side of the lynchers when he also said that<br />\nthe opinions of Dr. Mitchell were not necessarily the<br />\nopinions of the whole faculty. That is not a \"repudiation\", as Mr. Mencken is pleased to term it, of Dr.<br />\nMitchell's ideas. It merely leaves the rest of the staff<br />\nfree to take individual stands upon the matter. It is<br />\nundeniably the duty of the president of a university<br />\nto make it clear that a particular act is not one of<br /><br />\nThe Reign Of Despondency<br />\nWriting today upon current political, social, and<br />\neconomic matters is colored by a spirit which has<br />\nprobably never before made itself felt to such an extent by contributors to American periodicals. It is<br />\nmore than an undercurrent of pessimism\u2014that feeling<br />\nat least implies a background of opinion about the<br />\nsituation prevailing. It is rather a pervading sense<br />\nof futility, inadequacy, incompetence to meet the exigencies of a chaotic system.<br />\nPep-talking and enthusiasm have long since deserted us. The Hearstian supplications to the noble<br />\nmanhood of America to \"stand shoulder-to-shoulder<br />\nto fend off the spectre of destruction\" have given way<br />\nto partly resentful picking and unsettled dissatisfaction. The press, instead of its former unquenchable<br />\navidity for new complications to explain away, now<br />\nfrankly admits its ignorance and seems but to be<br />\nfilling in time, waiting for definite issues to emerge.<br />\nIndustry, palpably disgruntled and verging on<br />\nrebelliousness, gives evidences of unwillingness to<br />\ntrust itself to further wildcat experimentalism. Even<br />\nsocialistic and communistic panaceas find no widely<br />\ncurrent vogue among social rehabilitators. Washington, formerly the hot-bed of ideas for political salvation, now is grimly desperate. The White House<br />\nstrives frenziedly to divert attention from reality to<br />\nquestionably justified schemes.<br />\nIn keeping with the ruling spirit, then, we have<br />\nnothing definite to say. There seems to be nothing<br />\nto say. The best minds in the country are patently at<br />\nan impasse. If we were to lie down on the job in this<br />\nfashion under any other circumstances we would<br />\njustly deserve charges of mental and moral cowardice.<br />\nBut the better part of wisdom, after a manner of<br />\nthinking, seems to be in this case to dig a hole and<br />\nwait for the cataclysm.

Contrary<br />\nto placing America's monetary unit back on normal<br />\nlevel, the new policy seemed actually making matters<br />\nworse.<br />\nAnd now, even more radical measures come to<br />\nlight. In a desperate attempt to raise prices and<br />\nrestore currency values without inflation, it is planned<br />\nto reach into Old World fields in search of gold.
