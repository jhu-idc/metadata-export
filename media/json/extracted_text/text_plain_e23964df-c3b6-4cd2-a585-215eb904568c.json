Who else<br />\ninsults his audience more often than the records under<br />\nreview? Nay, not even the early John Simon was ever so<br />\ncaustic, egocentric and pretentious. Surely Considine has<br />\nalienated more readers than any other critic. How many<br />\ntimes can you, as a reader, be told tnat you're stupid<br />\nbefore you finally conclude that Considine's head is on a<br />\nplane so lofty that even Plato would be bewildered there?<br />\n,So iiere is Monsieur Considine with another of his hefty<br />\nanthologies, all of which, I might note, have been<br />\npublished for the Christmas season, as if we all had<br />\nnothing better to do daring the noliday season than<br />\nponder the same reviews in hardback that we suffered<br />\nthrough wiien they appeared in the thankfully somewhat<br />\nmore ephemeral pages of the Baltimore City Squeeze, the<br />\nJohns Hopkins News-Letter, and the Baltimore<br />\nSunpapers. This particular monster is a collection of<br />\nConsidine pieces from his Hopkins period. A reliable<br />\nBaltimore source, who, in fact, was a drinking companion<br />\nof Mr. Considine's before a heated discussion caused him<br />\nto heft a typewriter at the lanky musicologist, once told ' Tiiat brings us to a discussion of iiis style, which is<br />\nme over a sangria that during the Hopkins period surely the nippest, most repetitious tooting of his own<br />\nConsidine was notorious for writing his copy as much as a horn that this reviewer has encountered in his many<br />\nhalf day after the posted copy deadline, and, deep breath, :centuries of critical study. Records, for Considine, are<br />\nas if that weren't bad enough, writing stories in a matter either hip or not hip, and truly great records are \"really<br />\nof minutes, and right on the composer! The only thing hip\" or \"really hot shit.\" Then there's ids penchant for<br />\nadmirable about that paicedure was that the articles, French. One recent Squeeze article included in this<br />\nthough utterly ungrammatical, were brief. Now those anthology begins by calling its reading audience petit<br />\nshort critical blasts have been eternalized in hardback, and .bourgeois,then goes on to call the albums of the Doobie<br />\nthere's even been talk that the Anthony Braxton Press Brothers deja-ecoute.

Indeed, the book could only be of interest to a few French fragments are meant to let the reader know that<br />\nindividuals other than Considine, and they are the few Monsieur Considine is fluent, uu courant, avant-garde, intl.<br />\nThe conceit goes much further than that. Posing as a<br />\nartists he has ever had a kind word for. Like the early<br />\nSimon, when Considine likes someone's music, wiiich isn't pan-everything, Mr. Considine constantly forces iiis own<br />\noften, he throws up all over the living room furniture in rather shallow political and social comments on us, as if<br />\nhis praise. Sure Anthony Braxton, Ornette Coleman and readers of a Mozart review really need to know how<br />\nRay Charles will read this book, tiloagh the latter will Considine feels about Carter. This 730 page volume is his<br />\nhave to wait for the Braille edition soon to be published encyclopedia of tributes to himself, his meandering<br />\nby the Schonberg Foundation, but will Linda Ronstadt wanderings into toe lofty and secluded corridors of his<br />\nread it?

That's a 'lefty title, but the book,<br />\nat twenty-six pages, is terse, and Galkin, like this reviewer,<br />\ndismisses Considine's bass playing in two pages(padded at<br />\nthat), 'Lis academic career in one page (actually it's a<br />\nxerox of Considine's Hopkins' transcript, with the word<br />\n\"sic\" typed maliciously beneath it), and Considine's sex<br />\nlife is included in that brief passage on his bass playing in<br />\na few rather vague sentences dealing with tile unusually<br />\nstrong hands that bass players have. Galkin is probably<br />\njust being discreet. Still GalKin's, expose of Considine is<br />\nfascinating reading, as is another volume on Considine,<br />\nthis one a spin-off from Bellow's Humboldt's Gift,<br />\nCharley Citrine's Great Modern Bores, in which Considine<br />\nis dismissed as \"the hippest wordster and hottest shitter<br />\nyet produced in petit bourgeois America.

Both<br />\nfilms were adapted from little-known novels by the<br />\nfamous Italian-American writer Peter Rodino which told<br />\nthe continuing story of two families, the Spumonis and<br />\nthe Tortonis in their constant struggle against the<br />\nunfairness of the American capitalist<br />\nsystem<br />\n_and the way grinds down tue individual, de-humanizes<br />\nthe soul, and overall promotes a state of uncertainty and<br />\nboredom and intellectual dullness inherent,<br />\nunfortunately, in the Italian-American.<br />\nThe film opens with Giacomo Spumoni(George Brent)<br />\ntraining for the Golden Gloves. He's a welterweight and<br />\nthe first line spoken in the film is \"You know, Vito, Wop<br />\nspelled backwards is POW,\" whereupon Giacomo<br />\naccidentally decks Vito Tortoni, his trainer (William<br />\nFrawley). In the background, a member of The Black<br />\nHand, Noodles Oregano (superbly played by Farley<br />\nGranger) looks on. Fans of Farley Granger should be<br />\nwarned that this is the only scene in which lie appears and<br />\nthat there is no further mention of the Black Hand in tile<br />\nfilm, which some may find sloppy work on Wellmen's<br />\npart, 'but I find truly indicative of The Black Hand's<br />\ninfluence in America, or, for that matter, Sicily.

We<br />\ndidn't think nothin' of it at the time--matter of fact, there<br />\nwas a few of us who .thought it was the biggest pile of<br />\ndoodly-squat ole Mikey had put down in quite a spell, but<br />\nthat just goes to show that there ain't no accountin' for<br />\ntaste. Wellsir, it warn't more than a day after it hit the<br />\nstreets that the phone started ringin'. The first call was<br />\nfrom some religious group squawkin' about how Mike's<br />\narticle was obscene and sacreligious and all--but from filen<br />\non it was all bigshots callin' in from New York City and<br />\nLondon and Cleveland and a whole mess of other places<br />\ntoo, and they was all wantin' to jaw with Mike. It seems<br />\nsome of them literary fellas up Princeton way got a hold<br />\nof a stray NewsLetter and were so tickled about that<br />\narticle that they damn near busted a gut. They say ole<br />\nMike's a genius and ought to be famous and lecture and<br />\nall that. Then came the big newspaper boys wavin'<br />\ncontracts and talkin' big bucks and how Mikey was to<br />\nhave a regular column with his picture next to the byline<br />\nand everything. (There was also a sissyfied fella from<br />\nHollywood who looked like he coulda changed a nine<br />\nwith three threes, but J.D. got pissed off and threw ilim<br />\nout pretty quick.) Next thing we know, Mike's been writ<br />\nup in this fancy journal by this Princeton fella Cliff Note.<br />\nWellsir, I still don't rightly know what all the fuss is about<br />\nbut they say that Mikey just won Mr. Pulitzer's prize. I<br />\nshure hope there's some cash somewhere in that prize<br />\ncause Mikey could use some newduds real bad. Anyiloo,<br />\nseem' as how-it's Mike's twenty-first birthday and all, we<br />\ndecided to reprint that Princeton fella's article and show<br />\neverybody just how far a good ole boy from the<br />\nNewsLetter can go if he puts his mind to it.<br />\n<br />\nMIKE DEAK'S \"COMING OF AGE IN THE 1970's\"<br />\nA DIALECTICAL HOMERIC VISION<br />\nby J. Cliff Note<br />\n<br />\nDeak dives right in, tearing the fabric of objectivity<br />\nasunder. Transcending time and space, he transforms life<br />\ninto a freeze-dried exclamation point.<br />\nSomething is wrong here. The elements of this picture are<br />\nnot consistant with tile overall context and the frame is<br />\nmuch too bourgeois and celluloid jor my liking.<br />\nRight away we are hit in the groin as it were, by the<br />\nongoing class struggle. The bourgeois frame is trying to<br />\nenclose and envelope the proletariat painting, cutting off<br />\nits vital contact with the enlightened masses mu)come to<br />\ngaze at it and experience spontaneous demonstrations of<br />\naltered reality. Deak obviously sees modern free-form art<br />\nas tile only escape from the reactionary snapshot<br />\nscrapbook of modern America.<br />\nThe truth is dear reader, that I hate even the wildest of<br />\nparties._<br />\nWhat a touching vision of the alienation of twentieth<br />\ncentury man! What an electrifying grasp he has of the<br />\nstark walls and dark corners of the megalopolis<br />\nmindframe! Notice the clever Use of\u2022the comma, which<br />\ndivides the sentence into two parts.<br />\nDeak now turns his back on the gloomy wasteland of<br />\nthe present and gazes towards the golden past, the lost joy<br />\nof childhood, the half-remembered dream-warmth of the<br />\nwomb.<br />\nIn front of me are two nerdish nebishes executing a game<br />\nof slightly bacchanalian backgammon...and four from a<br />\nnathical Cercian land called \"Goucher\"...<br />\nThe sublime alliteration in the \"nerd\" passage sets up the<br />\nprimal beat so vital to all digretions toward Greek<br />\nmythology. As we read we can almost hear Zeus and Pan<br />\nchanting as black rolls<br />\ndouble sixes. By bringing in<br />\nGreece at this particular moment, Deal, is reminding us of<br />\nthe neo-ionic forces which make themselves felt at every<br />\nlevel of contemporary regionalistic art forms. At another<br />\nlevel, the mezzanine to be exact. this passage can be seen in<br />\n<br />\nPortrait of the Artist as a Young Man<br />\nthe context of a thinly veiled poke at the decadance of<br />\nmodern collegiate life. At still another level this passage<br />\ncan be seen in blacklight, but this makes it very difficult<br />\nto read.<br />\nThe watershed rapidly approaching, time becomes<br />\nunfrozen and the author moves on to discredit language<br />\nitself.<br />\n...size's strumming a guitar and singing songs she calls<br />\n\"mellow\", but are really fblk\".<br />\nDeak underscored the confusion and 'ultimately the<br />\nuselessness of language by graphically revealing the<br />\nsubjective nature of words and contrasting them to the<br />\n\"pure\" and \"unspoiled\" strains of the guitar. The<br />\nsimilarities between the shape of a guitar (at least tho.,e of<br />\nthe acoustic genre) and woman's body are obvious, and<br />\nMike undoubtedly sees the instrument as a ,urrogate<br />\nlover. This sexual theme is given a Faulknerian twist in<br />\nthe next passage.<br />\nShe reminds me of my sister, but tn., sister is not fat nor<br />\nhas red hair, but did ,'lay guitar and sing folk songs bcck<br />\nwhen she was young and foolish.<br />\nIncest is a subjeci very close to Mr. Deak's heart. His<br />\nstriking ugliness probably led him to idolize his sister in<br />\nplace of the other girls at school, who undoubtedly had<br />\nsevere cri mps whenever ne walked by. Notice the words<br />\n\"young\" and \"foolish\"--expressing the deep-rooted sham.:<br />\nover past sibling-sexual indiscretions . This inwardly<br />\nspiralling matrix of tinter-family relationships comes out<br />\nagain and again as he attempts to define his role in the<br />\nextended family of off-campus living:<br />\nI wonder about my relatio. ship to these kids. Am I a<br />\nbrother, father, offunny uncle?<br />\nObviously tiring of incest, Deak does not manipulate this<br />\ntheme gently yet insistantly to its shuddering climax,inor<br />\ndoes 1ie attempt to hungrily pry the dark portals oi\u2022<br />\nfragrani misgivings aside anide and plunge holly into the<br />\ndark depths of the enigma, but rather, he pulls out<br />\nsuddenly and lets the argument fall of its won accord. All<br />\nhe leaves us with is till:, melancholy image of frozen<br />\nerogenous zones:<br />\nIt is a cold night and the frost is on the bumpkin.<br />\n<br />\nMiddle row,second from left.<br />\n<br />\nto cases. A clo\u201ee reading of the text clearly reveals a great<br />\ndeal of what lies heavily en the author's mind.<br />\n(by now I can get one fist completely into action like 14<br />\nperpetual motion machine pumping up and dowa the<br />\ndrillshaft to draw the white gold from the bowels of the<br />\nearth)<br />\nPerhaps the most quoted line of the article, we see here<br />\nthe author's deep disgust with technological \u2022 society. In a<br />\nworld where an act as tender and gentle as jerking off has<br />\nbecome just another sterile, degrading job, Deak is<br />\nsearching for a former.pastoral existence where men can<br />\nlive as God meant them to, and paddle the pickle without<br />\nshame. Unfortunately, however, ite cannot escape from<br />\nthe self-loathing wilich early ciiildhood training has made<br />\nsynonymous with hammering the ho.,e.

Clearly, Deak is an artist deeply tied<br />\nto his past, who sees auto-eroticism as an escape from<br />\nwhat he feels is a suffocating heritage which will attempt<br />\nto pigeonhole him into conformity.<br />\nAfter a careful reading of this famous sequence, who<br />\namong us can doubt that Mike Deak is a master as well as<br />\na masturbator?<br />\nNow we bid farewell to the purely sensual world of sex<br />\nand venture forth into the scientific.<br />\nI want to know a zillion and one things, to jump over the<br />\nluxon wall and join the tachyonic particles travelling at<br />\nsupernatural velocities, now and then giving off a burst of<br />\nphotons (get out those Cerenkov counters boys and girls)<br />\nin the form ofan article like OILS. hy do I wish to reduce<br />\nmy consciousness to a particle?

I guess it has something to do<br />\nwith it having always been hip to disdain<br />\nwhatever the masses found to be hip, and the<br />\nelite (as music critics, journalists, and other<br />\nassorted hangers-on tend to class themselves)<br />\ngenerally view the masses in an 'us against them'<br />\nfashion. It is important that you bear this in<br />\nmind, because since journalism of this sort<br />\namounts to a great deal of posturing to pad out<br />\nrather testy prose, it becomes very difficult to<br />\nwrite if you aren't sure of the proper posture.<br />\nTo begin with, I had never been to a disco<br />\nbefore. This was something I rather artfully<br />\nmanaged to conceal when the arrangements were<br />\nmade which put me behind the turntables last<br />\nThursday. Of course, I was not a complete<br />\nnovice; through the airshifts I had garnered while<br />\nat two of Baltimore's Public Radio stations.<br />\nfamiliar with both the equipment and the<br />\nconcept of playing music for public consumption.<br />\nDue to the nature of my employment (I sell<br />\nrecords for fun and tuition),! had access to the<br />\nproper albums and singles. Not only did I know<br />\nwhat was hot, but I had heard so many of them I<br />\nhad begun to think of my store as the world's<br />\nonly disco with a classical section.<br />\nBut just because you know what to play does<br />\nnot mean that you know when to play it. So it<br />\nwas with no small anxiety that I approached the<br />\ntable, turntable and records in hand, at which I<br />\nwas to spend the evening.<br />\nAs a disc jockey of sorts, I have been long<br />\naccustomed to the disillusioning lack of glamour<br />\ninvolved in radio studios. The table, however, was<br />\nless than I had expected. It was, well, a table,<br />\nwith one questionable turntable already sitting on<br />\nit, a bunch of wires (I always panic when<br />\nconfronted with a mass of wiring), a mixer board,<br />\nand possibly the brightest desk lamp I have ever<br />\nencountered.<br />\nOnce the obliging tech crew got my borrowed<br />\nturntable plugged in, they wanted to get a sound<br />\ncheck. Eager to please, I put my trusty Seatvind<br />\nalbum on the turntable, and they hit the volume<br />\nand began adjusting the equalizer. I looked out<br />\nonto the floor, and lo and behold, there was<br />\nsomeone dancing. I was impressed. As I kept the<br />\nmusic going, the levels having been pronounced<br />\n`ok,' this young lady was joined by occasional<br />\ndancers, but she remained my standard. Playing<br />\nthis and that, I put on the Bee Gees' You Should<br />\nBe Dancing. Hot damn! at least five couples on<br />\nthe floor. All right, we're rolling now! Feeling<br />\nrather smug with success. I put on K.C. and the<br />\nSunshitte Band,<br />\ninoafi.)

What are they, dead? So I put on<br />\nCalypso Breakdown, from Ralph MacDonald's<br />\nalbum. The number doubles.<br />\nNow we're rolling. They keep dancing, and as<br />\nscramble for the next cut, a Goucher girl comes<br />\nover to ask about what was being played. She was<br />\na customer at the store all summer, and upon<br />\nrecognizing me asks, \"How are you? I didn't<br />\nknow you did this!\" Well, I responded, actually<br />\nI'm researching .a story for the News-Letter.<br />\n\"Uh-huh.\"<br />\nAs things gather steam, I begin to get requests.<br />\nOne young lady begins to go through my records,<br />\nmaking sure, I assume, that I knew what I was<br />\ndoing. Slowly. I began to realize some of the<br />\nmistakes I had made in choosing my records. All I<br />\nhad from Stevie Wonder was I Wish, which was<br />\nalmost enough, but not quite. I had forgotten<br />\nvifth of Beethoven. I should have brought more<br />\n<br />\nwhat the floor looked like, except for thOse<br />\nnearest the turntables. But I could see the people<br />\nsitting nearby, and that was enough. Like the girl<br />\nin the kimono and white-face. Uh-huh. Perhaps<br />\nwhat was most disturbing was that no one else<br />\nthought it odd that she was sitting there in a<br />\nkimono and white-face._<br />\nMost of the people, though, were average folks,<br />\nranging from the friends who I had told to come<br />\ndown and say hello, to those who recognized me<br />\nand displayed minor shock. What can I say? As a<br />\ngirl in one of my classes put it, \"What's a nice<br />\nboy like you doing in a place like this?\" Just<br />\ngetting the facts, ma'm.<br />\nAll went well until I cued up Rubberband Man<br />\non the crusty Garrard I had been provided. What<br />\ncame from the speakers._when the volume went<br />\nup . is still under discussion, but the general<br />\nconsensus was that it was a relative of<br />\nSensurround from the film Earthquake.<br />\nSomething else, quick, so I grabbed the Brothers<br />\nJohnson album, and the slightly annoyed crowd<br />\nwas calmed down by HI Be Good .to You.<br />\nQuickly dumping the Spinners single, I readied<br />\nShame, Shame, Shame. The volume went up, and<br />\nL.A. crumbled again.<br />\nI don't know what the story was. I don't care,<br />\nreally. Maybe God, in His infinite wisdom, didn't<br />\nwant to hear those tunes at that particular time..<br />\nWho knows? All I can say is that it's a damn good<br />\nthing there were several good dance tunes on the<br />\nBrothers Johnson album. As I scrambled for<br />\nthings to play, my associate , tower of rationality,<br />\nsaid, -\"Don't worry, there's another turntable on<br />\nthe way.\" So the tech crew continued to operate,<br />\nunsuccessfully, on the accursed turntable, while I<br />\nmoved very fast, trying to create the illusion that<br />\nall was well.<br />\nIndeed, the other turntable did arrive, and I<br />\nwill be forever grateful. And indeed, I finished<br />\nout the evening with only a few other minor<br />\ndisasters. But do you know what surprised me<br />\nmore than anything, more than the fact that<br />\npeople danced to the Beach Boys, more than the<br />\nwoman in the kimono, more than the number of<br />\nthings that could have gone wrong and did? I had<br />\nfun.. I had fun despite the hassles, the nerves, the<br />\nmusic, the equipment. I had fun despite my need<br />\nto be as hip as possible. I just plain had full.<br />\n<br />\nt.<br />\n<br />\nScaggs. And so on. Some of the requests gea little odd, like the guy who asked fo,Acrosmith. At a disco?<br />\nThere was a suprisingly strong facti,,,;<br />\ndemanding Beach Boys, as well as a you.ig<br />\nwoman who wandered around shouting for an<br />\n\"all Beatles night!\" I for one have never<br />\nunderstood the appeal of the Beach Boys, but I<br />\nhad come prepared anyway. California Girls went<br />\non. and they danced. A warning came that Beach<br />\nBoys tunes went best in pairs, and so Fun, Fun,<br />\nUun followed. Finally back to business, as the<br />\nBrothers Johnson proceeded to get'the funk out\u2022<br />\nma face. .<br />\nOf course, a disco is more than just music.<br />\nDisco people seem to be a fair amount of the<br />\nattraction, and there certainly were some people<br />\nthere that night.

Considine's<br />\ngot more hot wax than any other musicologist on the<br />\nblock. Hissizzling, searing, outrageous, and never tasteful<br />\none-liners are the terror of the music industry. Who else<br />\ninsults his audience more often than the records under<br />\nreview? Nay, not even the early John Simon was ever so<br />\ncaustic, egocentric and pretentious. Surely Considine has<br />\nalienated more readers than any other critic. How many<br />\ntimes can you, as a reader, be told tnat you're stupid<br />\nbefore you finally conclude that Considine's head is on a<br />\nplane so lofty that even Plato would be bewildered there?<br />\n,So iiere is Monsieur Considine with another of his hefty<br />\nanthologies, all of which, I might note, have been<br />\npublished for the Christmas season, as if we all had<br />\nnothing better to do daring the noliday season than<br />\nponder the same reviews in hardback that we suffered<br />\nthrough wiien they appeared in the thankfully somewhat<br />\nmore ephemeral pages of the Baltimore City Squeeze, the<br />\nJohns Hopkins News-Letter, and the Baltimore<br />\nSunpapers. This particular monster is a collection of<br />\nConsidine pieces from his Hopkins period. A reliable<br />\nBaltimore source, who, in fact, was a drinking companion<br />\nof Mr. Considine's before a heated discussion caused him<br />\nto heft a typewriter at the lanky musicologist, once told ' Tiiat brings us to a discussion of iiis style, which is<br />\nme over a sangria that during the Hopkins period surely the nippest, most repetitious tooting of his own<br />\nConsidine was notorious for writing his copy as much as a horn that this reviewer has encountered in his many<br />\nhalf day after the posted copy deadline, and, deep breath, :centuries of critical study. Records, for Considine, are<br />\nas if that weren't bad enough, writing stories in a matter either hip or not hip, and truly great records are \"really<br />\nof minutes, and right on the composer! The only thing hip\" or \"really hot shit.\" Then there's ids penchant for<br />\nadmirable about that paicedure was that the articles, French. One recent Squeeze article included in this<br />\nthough utterly ungrammatical, were brief. Now those anthology begins by calling its reading audience petit<br />\nshort critical blasts have been eternalized in hardback, and .bourgeois,then goes on to call the albums of the Doobie<br />\nthere's even been talk that the Anthony Braxton Press Brothers deja-ecoute.

Indeed, the book could only be of interest to a few French fragments are meant to let the reader know that<br />\nindividuals other than Considine, and they are the few Monsieur Considine is fluent, uu courant, avant-garde, intl.<br />\nThe conceit goes much further than that. Posing as a<br />\nartists he has ever had a kind word for. Like the early<br />\nSimon, when Considine likes someone's music, wiiich isn't pan-everything, Mr. Considine constantly forces iiis own<br />\noften, he throws up all over the living room furniture in rather shallow political and social comments on us, as if<br />\nhis praise. Sure Anthony Braxton, Ornette Coleman and readers of a Mozart review really need to know how<br />\nRay Charles will read this book, tiloagh the latter will Considine feels about Carter. This 730 page volume is his<br />\nhave to wait for the Braille edition soon to be published encyclopedia of tributes to himself, his meandering<br />\nby the Schonberg Foundation, but will Linda Ronstadt wanderings into toe lofty and secluded corridors of his<br />\nread it?

That's a 'lefty title, but the book,<br />\nat twenty-six pages, is terse, and Galkin, like this reviewer,<br />\ndismisses Considine's bass playing in two pages(padded at<br />\nthat), 'Lis academic career in one page (actually it's a<br />\nxerox of Considine's Hopkins' transcript, with the word<br />\n\"sic\" typed maliciously beneath it), and Considine's sex<br />\nlife is included in that brief passage on his bass playing in<br />\na few rather vague sentences dealing with tile unusually<br />\nstrong hands that bass players have. Galkin is probably<br />\njust being discreet. Still GalKin's, expose of Considine is<br />\nfascinating reading, as is another volume on Considine,<br />\nthis one a spin-off from Bellow's Humboldt's Gift,<br />\nCharley Citrine's Great Modern Bores, in which Considine<br />\nis dismissed as \"the hippest wordster and hottest shitter<br />\nyet produced in petit bourgeois America.

He's a welterweight and<br />\nthe first line spoken in the film is \"You know, Vito, Wop<br />\nspelled backwards is POW,\" whereupon Giacomo<br />\naccidentally decks Vito Tortoni, his trainer (William<br />\nFrawley). In the background, a member of The Black<br />\nHand, Noodles Oregano (superbly played by Farley<br />\nGranger) looks on. Fans of Farley Granger should be<br />\nwarned that this is the only scene in which lie appears and<br />\nthat there is no further mention of the Black Hand in tile<br />\nfilm, which some may find sloppy work on Wellmen's<br />\npart, 'but I find truly indicative of The Black Hand's<br />\ninfluence in America, or, for that matter, Sicily.

We<br />\ndidn't think nothin' of it at the time--matter of fact, there<br />\nwas a few of us who .thought it was the biggest pile of<br />\ndoodly-squat ole Mikey had put down in quite a spell, but<br />\nthat just goes to show that there ain't no accountin' for<br />\ntaste. Wellsir, it warn't more than a day after it hit the<br />\nstreets that the phone started ringin'. The first call was<br />\nfrom some religious group squawkin' about how Mike's<br />\narticle was obscene and sacreligious and all--but from filen<br />\non it was all bigshots callin' in from New York City and<br />\nLondon and Cleveland and a whole mess of other places<br />\ntoo, and they was all wantin' to jaw with Mike. It seems<br />\nsome of them literary fellas up Princeton way got a hold<br />\nof a stray NewsLetter and were so tickled about that<br />\narticle that they damn near busted a gut. They say ole<br />\nMike's a genius and ought to be famous and lecture and<br />\nall that. Then came the big newspaper boys wavin'<br />\ncontracts and talkin' big bucks and how Mikey was to<br />\nhave a regular column with his picture next to the byline<br />\nand everything. (There was also a sissyfied fella from<br />\nHollywood who looked like he coulda changed a nine<br />\nwith three threes, but J.D. got pissed off and threw ilim<br />\nout pretty quick.)

Cliff Note<br /><br />\nDeak dives right in, tearing the fabric of objectivity<br />\nasunder. Transcending time and space, he transforms life<br />\ninto a freeze-dried exclamation point.<br />\nSomething is wrong here. The elements of this picture are<br />\nnot consistant with tile overall context and the frame is<br />\nmuch too bourgeois and celluloid jor my liking.<br />\nRight away we are hit in the groin as it were, by the<br />\nongoing class struggle. The bourgeois frame is trying to<br />\nenclose and envelope the proletariat painting, cutting off<br />\nits vital contact with the enlightened masses mu)come to<br />\ngaze at it and experience spontaneous demonstrations of<br />\naltered reality. Deak obviously sees modern free-form art<br />\nas tile only escape from the reactionary snapshot<br />\nscrapbook of modern America.<br />\nThe truth is dear reader, that I hate even the wildest of<br />\nparties._<br />\nWhat a touching vision of the alienation of twentieth<br />\ncentury man! What an electrifying grasp he has of the<br />\nstark walls and dark corners of the megalopolis<br />\nmindframe! Notice the clever Use of\u2022the comma, which<br />\ndivides the sentence into two parts.<br />\nDeak now turns his back on the gloomy wasteland of<br />\nthe present and gazes towards the golden past, the lost joy<br />\nof childhood, the half-remembered dream-warmth of the<br />\nwomb.<br />\nIn front of me are two nerdish nebishes executing a game<br />\nof slightly bacchanalian backgammon...and four from a<br />\nnathical Cercian land called \"Goucher\"...<br />\nThe sublime alliteration in the \"nerd\" passage sets up the<br />\nprimal beat so vital to all digretions toward Greek<br />\nmythology. As we read we can almost hear Zeus and Pan<br />\nchanting as black rolls<br />\ndouble sixes. By bringing in<br />\nGreece at this particular moment, Deal, is reminding us of<br />\nthe neo-ionic forces which make themselves felt at every<br />\nlevel of contemporary regionalistic art forms. At another<br />\nlevel, the mezzanine to be exact. this passage can be seen in<br /><br />\nPortrait of the Artist as a Young Man<br />\nthe context of a thinly veiled poke at the decadance of<br />\nmodern collegiate life. At still another level this passage<br />\ncan be seen in blacklight, but this makes it very difficult<br />\nto read.<br />\nThe watershed rapidly approaching, time becomes<br />\nunfrozen and the author moves on to discredit language<br />\nitself.<br />\n...size's strumming a guitar and singing songs she calls<br />\n\"mellow\", but are really fblk\".<br />\nDeak underscored the confusion and 'ultimately the<br />\nuselessness of language by graphically revealing the<br />\nsubjective nature of words and contrasting them to the<br />\n\"pure\" and \"unspoiled\" strains of the guitar. The<br />\nsimilarities between the shape of a guitar (at least tho.,e of<br />\nthe acoustic genre) and woman's body are obvious, and<br />\nMike undoubtedly sees the instrument as a ,urrogate<br />\nlover. This sexual theme is given a Faulknerian twist in<br />\nthe next passage.<br />\nShe reminds me of my sister, but tn., sister is not fat nor<br />\nhas red hair, but did ,'lay guitar and sing folk songs bcck<br />\nwhen she was young and foolish.<br />\nIncest is a subjeci very close to Mr. Deak's heart. His<br />\nstriking ugliness probably led him to idolize his sister in<br />\nplace of the other girls at school, who undoubtedly had<br />\nsevere cri mps whenever ne walked by. Notice the words<br />\n\"young\" and \"foolish\"--expressing the deep-rooted sham.:<br />\nover past sibling-sexual indiscretions . This inwardly<br />\nspiralling matrix of tinter-family relationships comes out<br />\nagain and again as he attempts to define his role in the<br />\nextended family of off-campus living:<br />\nI wonder about my relatio. ship to these kids. Am I a<br />\nbrother, father, offunny uncle?<br />\nObviously tiring of incest, Deak does not manipulate this<br />\ntheme gently yet insistantly to its shuddering climax,inor<br />\ndoes 1ie attempt to hungrily pry the dark portals oi\u2022<br />\nfragrani misgivings aside anide and plunge holly into the<br />\ndark depths of the enigma, but rather, he pulls out<br />\nsuddenly and lets the argument fall of its won accord. All<br />\nhe leaves us with is till:, melancholy image of frozen<br />\nerogenous zones:<br />\nIt is a cold night and the frost is on the bumpkin.<br /><br />\nMiddle row,second from left.<br /><br />\nto cases. A clo\u201ee reading of the text clearly reveals a great<br />\ndeal of what lies heavily en the author's mind.<br />\n(by now I can get one fist completely into action like 14<br />\nperpetual motion machine pumping up and dowa the<br />\ndrillshaft to draw the white gold from the bowels of the<br />\nearth)<br />\nPerhaps the most quoted line of the article, we see here<br />\nthe author's deep disgust with technological \u2022 society. In a<br />\nworld where an act as tender and gentle as jerking off has<br />\nbecome just another sterile, degrading job, Deak is<br />\nsearching for a former.pastoral existence where men can<br />\nlive as God meant them to, and paddle the pickle without<br />\nshame. Unfortunately, however, ite cannot escape from<br />\nthe self-loathing wilich early ciiildhood training has made<br />\nsynonymous with hammering the ho.,e.

Clearly, Deak is an artist deeply tied<br />\nto his past, who sees auto-eroticism as an escape from<br />\nwhat he feels is a suffocating heritage which will attempt<br />\nto pigeonhole him into conformity.<br />\nAfter a careful reading of this famous sequence, who<br />\namong us can doubt that Mike Deak is a master as well as<br />\na masturbator?<br />\nNow we bid farewell to the purely sensual world of sex<br />\nand venture forth into the scientific.<br />\nI want to know a zillion and one things, to jump over the<br />\nluxon wall and join the tachyonic particles travelling at<br />\nsupernatural velocities, now and then giving off a burst of<br />\nphotons (get out those Cerenkov counters boys and girls)<br />\nin the form ofan article like OILS. hy do I wish to reduce<br />\nmy consciousness to a particle?

Of course, I was not a complete<br />\nnovice; through the airshifts I had garnered while<br />\nat two of Baltimore's Public Radio stations.<br />\nfamiliar with both the equipment and the<br />\nconcept of playing music for public consumption.<br />\nDue to the nature of my employment (I sell<br />\nrecords for fun and tuition),! had access to the<br />\nproper albums and singles. Not only did I know<br />\nwhat was hot, but I had heard so many of them I<br />\nhad begun to think of my store as the world's<br />\nonly disco with a classical section.<br />\nBut just because you know what to play does<br />\nnot mean that you know when to play it. So it<br />\nwas with no small anxiety that I approached the<br />\ntable, turntable and records in hand, at which I<br />\nwas to spend the evening.<br />\nAs a disc jockey of sorts, I have been long<br />\naccustomed to the disillusioning lack of glamour<br />\ninvolved in radio studios. The table, however, was<br />\nless than I had expected. It was, well, a table,<br />\nwith one questionable turntable already sitting on<br />\nit, a bunch of wires (I always panic when<br />\nconfronted with a mass of wiring), a mixer board,<br />\nand possibly the brightest desk lamp I have ever<br />\nencountered.<br />\nOnce the obliging tech crew got my borrowed<br />\nturntable plugged in, they wanted to get a sound<br />\ncheck. Eager to please, I put my trusty Seatvind<br />\nalbum on the turntable, and they hit the volume<br />\nand began adjusting the equalizer. I looked out<br />\nonto the floor, and lo and behold, there was<br />\nsomeone dancing. I was impressed. As I kept the<br />\nmusic going, the levels having been pronounced<br />\n`ok,' this young lady was joined by occasional<br />\ndancers, but she remained my standard. Playing<br />\nthis and that, I put on the Bee Gees' You Should<br />\nBe Dancing. Hot damn! at least five couples on<br />\nthe floor. All right, we're rolling now! Feeling<br />\nrather smug with success. I put on K.C. and the<br />\nSunshitte Band,<br />\ninoafi.)

But I had them dancing.<br />\nYoa saw it: the Bee Gees were singing \"You<br />\nshould be dancing,\" and damned if they weren't.<br />\nWhat had I done? What if they don't ever get up?<br />\nSome story that would make.<br />\nO.K., suckers, it's the big guns now. Stevie<br />\nWonder's I Wish (my associate mumbles, \"I went<br />\nto a band showcase this weekend, and every<br />\ngroup I saw played this song...\"), and three<br /><br />\ncouples get up. What are they, dead? So I put on<br />\nCalypso Breakdown, from Ralph MacDonald's<br />\nalbum. The number doubles.<br />\nNow we're rolling. They keep dancing, and as<br />\nscramble for the next cut, a Goucher girl comes<br />\nover to ask about what was being played. She was<br />\na customer at the store all summer, and upon<br />\nrecognizing me asks, \"How are you? I didn't<br />\nknow you did this!\" Well, I responded, actually<br />\nI'm researching .a story for the News-Letter.<br />\n\"Uh-huh.\"<br />\nAs things gather steam, I begin to get requests.<br />\nOne young lady begins to go through my records,<br />\nmaking sure, I assume, that I knew what I was<br />\ndoing. Slowly. I began to realize some of the<br />\nmistakes I had made in choosing my records. All I<br />\nhad from Stevie Wonder was I Wish, which was<br />\nalmost enough, but not quite. I had forgotten<br />\nvifth of Beethoven. I should have brought more<br /><br />\nwhat the floor looked like, except for thOse<br />\nnearest the turntables. But I could see the people<br />\nsitting nearby, and that was enough. Like the girl<br />\nin the kimono and white-face. Uh-huh. Perhaps<br />\nwhat was most disturbing was that no one else<br />\nthought it odd that she was sitting there in a<br />\nkimono and white-face._<br />\nMost of the people, though, were average folks,<br />\nranging from the friends who I had told to come<br />\ndown and say hello, to those who recognized me<br />\nand displayed minor shock. What can I say? As a<br />\ngirl in one of my classes put it, \"What's a nice<br />\nboy like you doing in a place like this?\" Just<br />\ngetting the facts, ma'm.<br />\nAll went well until I cued up Rubberband Man<br />\non the crusty Garrard I had been provided. What<br />\ncame from the speakers._when the volume went<br />\nup . is still under discussion, but the general<br />\nconsensus was that it was a relative of<br />\nSensurround from the film Earthquake.<br />\nSomething else, quick, so I grabbed the Brothers<br />\nJohnson album, and the slightly annoyed crowd<br />\nwas calmed down by HI Be Good .to You.<br />\nQuickly dumping the Spinners single, I readied<br />\nShame, Shame, Shame. The volume went up, and<br />\nL.A. crumbled again.<br />\nI don't know what the story was. I don't care,<br />\nreally. Maybe God, in His infinite wisdom, didn't<br />\nwant to hear those tunes at that particular time..<br />\nWho knows? All I can say is that it's a damn good<br />\nthing there were several good dance tunes on the<br />\nBrothers Johnson album. As I scrambled for<br />\nthings to play, my associate , tower of rationality,<br />\nsaid, -\"Don't worry, there's another turntable on<br />\nthe way.\" So the tech crew continued to operate,<br />\nunsuccessfully, on the accursed turntable, while I<br />\nmoved very fast, trying to create the illusion that<br />\nall was well.<br />\nIndeed, the other turntable did arrive, and I<br />\nwill be forever grateful. And indeed, I finished<br />\nout the evening with only a few other minor<br />\ndisasters. But do you know what surprised me<br />\nmore than anything, more than the fact that<br />\npeople danced to the Beach Boys, more than the<br />\nwoman in the kimono, more than the number of<br />\nthings that could have gone wrong and did? I had<br />\nfun.. I had fun despite the hassles, the nerves, the<br />\nmusic, the equipment. I had fun despite my need<br />\nto be as hip as possible. I just plain had full.<br /><br />\nt.<br /><br />\nScaggs. And so on. Some of the requests gea little odd, like the guy who asked fo,Acrosmith. At a disco?<br />\nThere was a suprisingly strong facti,,,;<br />\ndemanding Beach Boys, as well as a you.ig<br />\nwoman who wandered around shouting for an<br />\n\"all Beatles night!\" I for one have never<br />\nunderstood the appeal of the Beach Boys, but I<br />\nhad come prepared anyway. California Girls went<br />\non. and they danced. A warning came that Beach<br />\nBoys tunes went best in pairs, and so Fun, Fun,<br />\nUun followed. Finally back to business, as the<br />\nBrothers Johnson proceeded to get'the funk out\u2022<br />\nma face. .<br />\nOf course, a disco is more than just music.<br />\nDisco people seem to be a fair amount of the<br />\nattraction, and there certainly were some people<br />\nthere that night. Because of the glare from 'my<br />\never-present desk lamp.
