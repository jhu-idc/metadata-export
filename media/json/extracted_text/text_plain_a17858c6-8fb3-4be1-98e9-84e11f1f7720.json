It<br />\nis a principle of survival that looks<br />\nupon any notions of spiritual transcendence as a painful fantasy for<br />\nthe unreasonable. To suggest that<br />\nreligion is a saving grace for humankind is to illicit instant heartburn in every Objectivist within<br />\nearshot.<br />\nThat kind of dispiriting aplomb<br />\ntakes a measurable amount of gall.<br />\nBut then, a little gall is always fun<br />\nwhen detected in someone else. Especially if the listener can back off<br />\nat will. And hence my state of<br />\ngleeful anticipation with the recent<br />\ncampus appearance of a journal<br />\nwith an \"Objectivist frame of reference.\"<br />\n<br />\nBy JAMES BENNETT<br />\n<br />\nRoger C. Toll<br />\n<br />\nToward this end, and with any and all means, we do not ask, but<br />\ndemand, recognition of a list of student rights. This list, signed by representatives of the administration and faculty along with the students, would put in concrete terms the relationship of the students<br />\ntoward the faculty and the administration.<br />\nThe Student Council has moved to draw up a student bill of<br />\nrights. We hope that its efforts will be successful, and that its product will be accepted by the administration.<br />\nThe American Association of University Professors has endorsed<br />\nthe student rights of several universities, and we hope that such<br />\nagreement and acceptance will be forthcoming from the Hopkins administration. If Homewood proves stodgy and unmoving in entering<br />\ninto dialogue on this point, it may well prove to be a grevious mistake on their part.<br />\nA student bill of rights would cover all fields of university activity,<br />\nincluding academic, social, and policy-making aspects.<br />\nIn the academic realm students should be given a voice on faculty<br />\ncommittees that decide choice of courses. Students should have an<br />\nappeal on grades. Students should have a voice on the Bookstore<br />\nCommittee.<br />\nIn respect to the social side of university life, students should<br />\nhave power to eradicate or create rules governing campus behavior.<br />\nStudents should have an active voice in the policy of the Plant Manager's Office. In this area, more than anywhere else, the student<br />\nshould follow rules that have been instituted by himself or his peers.<br />\nThe most important area of students' rights would be in policymaking. There should be student representation on the Long Range<br />\nPlanning Committee, on the Academic Council, and on the Budget<br />\nCommittee. In this way policies could be developed and instituted<br />\nthat would serve the interest of the faculty, the administration, and<br />\nthe students. The institution of the new drop date was sprung as a<br />\nsurprise on the student body,the group most affected by the change.<br />\nBy having students on the policy-making level this kind of the unpleasant trick could be avoided.<br />\nThere should also be a list of general student rights such as no administration reprisal for demonstrations, automatic review for all suspensions and dismissals, and a long term acceptance of the bill of<br />\nrights itself.<br />\nA student bill of rights should also command the respect and adherance of the students. It would not be a mandate for unreasonable<br />\nactions, but insurance against administration tyranny. It would not<br />\nbe anarchy, but democracy. It would not lead to chaos, but would<br />\nalleviate frustration. It would finally bring the students into an equal<br />\npartnership with the rest of the community, allowing graduate and<br />\nundergraduates to control their environment to a greater degree. It<br />\nwould improve the University so that future students could be the<br />\nbeneficiaries of a new, truly free educational institution.<br />\nWe await anxiously the administration reply.<br />\n<br />\nHOMEWOOD,BALTIMORE, NOVEMBER 10, 196<br />\n<br />\nObjectivisim is the philosophy<br />\nof Ayn Rand.

Classification of their music is impossible. It is so multifaceted that it overlaps the purely psychedelic or<br />\nthe purely satirical. Their previous records and performances have been composed of \"chance music\"<br />\nand comments on the Great Society. Under the<br />\ntechnological direction of Frank Zappa,(composer<br />\nand arranger) they are moving toward a pure expression of electronic music.<br />\nThis movement eliminates the negative note in<br />\ntheir reaction towards the \"middle class America\"<br />\nand builds toward the positive climax of a serious<br />\nmusical trend. Electronics is a field of its own.<br />\nBasically, it involves the extraction of different<br />\ntones from a pure sound. The \"Mothers\" first<br />\nprinciple is that the natural voice or one natural<br />\nnote can be amplified, interrupted or changed to<br />\nproduce different tonal qualities. This technique is<br />\naccomplished through the use of devices such as<br />\nthe ring modulator, oscillator and music snythesizer which receive the standard note or chord and<br />\nremove the naturalness of the sound. Through adjustment of various pitches two or more sounds<br />\nfrom the original one are produced.<br />\nThe Mothers are as unique as what they hope to<br />\nproduce. Their seriousness as artists cannot be denied. Taken as a whole, the group lives within the<br />\nmedia they use for communication. There is no<br />\naura of pretentiousness surrounding any member<br />\nof the band - - they are as honest in their appearance as in what they say.<br />\nIn the expression of their attitudes they have<br />\naroused a fear for the unknown, one of the greatest threats to conservative society.<br />\nBecause of this, it is easier to develop a dislike<br />\nfor the Mothers, than a comprehension of what<br />\nthey are trying to do. Their music demands a receptive and creative audience. An audience that<br />\nWill accept the \"Mothers\" for what they are and<br />\nnot for their reputation as a pure drug group.<br />\nWhen their first two albums were released their<br />\nmain concern was exposing the weakness of popular music. Concommitant with this was the first<br />\ncommercial experimentation in electronic music<br />\nusing different amplifications of standard instruments such as the guitar and organ. The press and<br />\nOther media were unable to provide a basis for critical evaluation or a categorization of this new<br />\ndevelopment and labeled it \"psychedelic\" for lack<br />\nof a better word.

The Doors<br />\nare on speed.<br />\nBut the show is all Morrison, who kisses, licks,<br />\nstrokes and plays with the microphone as if it were<br />\nthe Symbol.

Morrison<br />\n\u2022 puts on his mask again after looking bored. \"Mother, I'd like to . . .

Come, Come.\" The insides have been taken out and twisted, the head<br />\nswims.<br />\nMorrison throws his jacket on the stage and<br />\njumps around it, never jumping on it. He takes<br />\nthe microphone off the stand and starts to whip<br />\nthe jacket with the cord.<br />\nIf you listen quietly you can hear the breathing<br />\nfaster, the eyes wide.

It was very interesting that<br />\nthe Times did the article on the<br />\ngirl who was murdered. It was kind<br />\nof nauseating. In a way it is interesting to read that ;let mother<br />\nstill refers to her daughter in the<br />\npresent tense. And they did this<br />\nincredibly sentimental thing about<br />\nputting this one part in italics, the<br />\nbad part. This double life that this<br />\nchick has, as though she were the<br />\nfirst to lie to their parents. I wonder if the family was insulted by<br />\nthat. They were terribly exploited<br />\nby that whole article; like its the<br />\nworst kind of Daily News sensationalism. I wondered why the<br />\nTimes didn't run the same kind of<br />\narticle on one of the accused murderers. Go back to see his mother<br />\nor his father and dig out the whole<br />\nstory. They should trace a child<br />\ngrowing up in a black community<br />\nand his reactions to the hippies.<br />\nThat would really be worthwhile.<br />\nBut, I don't think the Times will<br />\ndo that - - I wonder sometimes<br />\nwhere they get their reporters.<br />\nLike today, for instance, they ended a long article on the Joan Baez<br />\narrest, and in the last paragraph<br />\nthey said that there was a marijuana smell around her.

Three did<br />\ntheir prize-winning work at Cal<br />\nTech and three laureates are still<br />\nthere. Berkeley gave six of the<br />\nlaureates their Ph. D.'s. Seven winners did their, major work there and<br />\nBerkeley now sports eight prize<br />\nwinners. Harvard trained eleven<br />\nlaureates and fourteen prizes were<br />\nwon for work 'done in Cambridge.<br />\nSeven winners now reside there.<br />\nJohns Hopkins trained six Nobel<br />\nPrize winners. None did their work<br />\nhere and none are here now.<br />\nDoes this absence of laureates<br />\nconstitute a lack in the Hopkins<br />\nCommunity? Dr. Richard Macksey,<br />\nProfessor of Humanities, thinks<br />\nthat perhaps it does,although such<br />\nan absence cannot be the sole<br />\ncriterion for judging the excellence<br />\nof a faculty. \"I certainly would<br />\nhave been worried if we hadn't<br />\ntrained any of them, though.\"Certainly,\" he says,\"it would<br />\nbe nice to have some monuments<br />\naround.- But although \"any university can buy one or two laureates, they may be, in fact, empty<br />\nshells by the time they are bought.\"<br />\nDr. Macksey went on to say<br />\nthat the fact that I lopkins has not<br />\nbeen able to keep its people is relevant in judging the .University.<br />\nDr. Allyn Kimball, Dean of Arts<br />\nand Sciences, pointed out the fact<br />\nthat the problem is ;tot necessarily<br />\nkeeping the people. Instead, it is<br />\nrecognizing talent and getting it<br />\nfrom wherever it is at the time.<br />\nHe cites the case of Harvard, which<br />\n<br />\nnever hires the people whom it<br />\nawards Ph.D.'s. \"They let them<br />\ngo, and in a few years, if they<br />\nlook good, get them back.\"<br />\nReasons Why<br />\nThere are several reasons why<br />\nHopkins has had no laureate work<br />\ndone, and has no prize winners on<br />\nits staff. The first disadvantage<br />\nfrom which the school suffers is a<br />\nlack of funds. Many departments<br />\ndo not have enough money to<br />\noperate normally, much less expand their programs. Also, equipment for the departments is very<br />\nhard to finance. Thus, many people, especially in the sciences, are<br />\nforced to leave for lack of equipment. Dr. Macksey cited the National Institute of Health and the<br />\nNational Science Foundation as<br />\ncontributors of funds and the \"salvation\" of many departments at<br />\nHopkins. Ile says that the University's proximity to/ Washington<br />\n<br />\nhelps it obtain funds from the two<br />\norganizations.<br />\nAnother problem, closely related to that of finances, is the lack<br />\nof size and scope in the school. Dr.<br />\nKimball states, \"The Long-Range<br />\nPlanning Committee report showed us that we were too small.- He<br />\nsays that in a department with<br />\nonly five people, such. as the Near<br />\nEastern Studies Department \"if<br />\none person leaves, it leaves an entire area of study wiped out.-<br />\n<br />\nPyramid Structure<br />\nDr. Macksey points out that<br />\nHopkins has trouble enticing the<br />\nFinally, Hopkins has traditionbest people to come because the ally pursued a policy of training,<br />\ndepartments are too narrow.

And they're<br />\nan uncompromising lot. Faithful<br />\nguardians of a closed system, an<br />\nimplacably dogmatic philosophy<br />\nof materialism. Smack in the center of a World without God, reason becomes man's compass, the<br />\ninstrument with which to plot his<br />\nown destiny of personal desires. It<br />\nis a principle of survival that looks<br />\nupon any notions of spiritual transcendence as a painful fantasy for<br />\nthe unreasonable. To suggest that<br />\nreligion is a saving grace for humankind is to illicit instant heartburn in every Objectivist within<br />\nearshot.<br />\nThat kind of dispiriting aplomb<br />\ntakes a measurable amount of gall.<br />\nBut then, a little gall is always fun<br />\nwhen detected in someone else. Especially if the listener can back off<br />\nat will. And hence my state of<br />\ngleeful anticipation with the recent<br />\ncampus appearance of a journal<br />\nwith an \"Objectivist frame of reference.\"<br /><br />\nBy JAMES BENNETT<br /><br />\nRoger C. Toll<br /><br />\nToward this end, and with any and all means, we do not ask, but<br />\ndemand, recognition of a list of student rights. This list, signed by representatives of the administration and faculty along with the students, would put in concrete terms the relationship of the students<br />\ntoward the faculty and the administration.<br />\nThe Student Council has moved to draw up a student bill of<br />\nrights. We hope that its efforts will be successful, and that its product will be accepted by the administration.<br />\nThe American Association of University Professors has endorsed<br />\nthe student rights of several universities, and we hope that such<br />\nagreement and acceptance will be forthcoming from the Hopkins administration. If Homewood proves stodgy and unmoving in entering<br />\ninto dialogue on this point, it may well prove to be a grevious mistake on their part.<br />\nA student bill of rights would cover all fields of university activity,<br />\nincluding academic, social, and policy-making aspects.<br />\nIn the academic realm students should be given a voice on faculty<br />\ncommittees that decide choice of courses. Students should have an<br />\nappeal on grades. Students should have a voice on the Bookstore<br />\nCommittee.<br />\nIn respect to the social side of university life, students should<br />\nhave power to eradicate or create rules governing campus behavior.<br />\nStudents should have an active voice in the policy of the Plant Manager's Office. In this area, more than anywhere else, the student<br />\nshould follow rules that have been instituted by himself or his peers.<br />\nThe most important area of students' rights would be in policymaking. There should be student representation on the Long Range<br />\nPlanning Committee, on the Academic Council, and on the Budget<br />\nCommittee. In this way policies could be developed and instituted<br />\nthat would serve the interest of the faculty, the administration, and<br />\nthe students. The institution of the new drop date was sprung as a<br />\nsurprise on the student body,the group most affected by the change.<br />\nBy having students on the policy-making level this kind of the unpleasant trick could be avoided.<br />\nThere should also be a list of general student rights such as no administration reprisal for demonstrations, automatic review for all suspensions and dismissals, and a long term acceptance of the bill of<br />\nrights itself.<br />\nA student bill of rights should also command the respect and adherance of the students. It would not be a mandate for unreasonable<br />\nactions, but insurance against administration tyranny. It would not<br />\nbe anarchy, but democracy. It would not lead to chaos, but would<br />\nalleviate frustration. It would finally bring the students into an equal<br />\npartnership with the rest of the community, allowing graduate and<br />\nundergraduates to control their environment to a greater degree. It<br />\nwould improve the University so that future students could be the<br />\nbeneficiaries of a new, truly free educational institution.<br />\nWe await anxiously the administration reply.<br /><br />\nHOMEWOOD,BALTIMORE, NOVEMBER 10, 196<br /><br />\nObjectivisim is the philosophy<br />\nof Ayn Rand.

Judging<br />\nfrom the sizeable number of oohs<br />\nand ahs emanating from the assembled Miss Rand came across strong.<br />\nSo strong, in fact, that I suspect<br />\nmany of the viewers were expectting her, any moment there, to<br />\nstart in on the nutritive merits of<br />\neating nails for breakfast.

Classification of their music is impossible. It is so multifaceted that it overlaps the purely psychedelic or<br />\nthe purely satirical. Their previous records and performances have been composed of \"chance music\"<br />\nand comments on the Great Society. Under the<br />\ntechnological direction of Frank Zappa,(composer<br />\nand arranger) they are moving toward a pure expression of electronic music.<br />\nThis movement eliminates the negative note in<br />\ntheir reaction towards the \"middle class America\"<br />\nand builds toward the positive climax of a serious<br />\nmusical trend. Electronics is a field of its own.<br />\nBasically, it involves the extraction of different<br />\ntones from a pure sound. The \"Mothers\" first<br />\nprinciple is that the natural voice or one natural<br />\nnote can be amplified, interrupted or changed to<br />\nproduce different tonal qualities. This technique is<br />\naccomplished through the use of devices such as<br />\nthe ring modulator, oscillator and music snythesizer which receive the standard note or chord and<br />\nremove the naturalness of the sound. Through adjustment of various pitches two or more sounds<br />\nfrom the original one are produced.<br />\nThe Mothers are as unique as what they hope to<br />\nproduce. Their seriousness as artists cannot be denied. Taken as a whole, the group lives within the<br />\nmedia they use for communication. There is no<br />\naura of pretentiousness surrounding any member<br />\nof the band - - they are as honest in their appearance as in what they say.<br />\nIn the expression of their attitudes they have<br />\naroused a fear for the unknown, one of the greatest threats to conservative society.<br />\nBecause of this, it is easier to develop a dislike<br />\nfor the Mothers, than a comprehension of what<br />\nthey are trying to do. Their music demands a receptive and creative audience. An audience that<br />\nWill accept the \"Mothers\" for what they are and<br />\nnot for their reputation as a pure drug group.<br />\nWhen their first two albums were released their<br />\nmain concern was exposing the weakness of popular music. Concommitant with this was the first<br />\ncommercial experimentation in electronic music<br />\nusing different amplifications of standard instruments such as the guitar and organ. The press and<br />\nOther media were unable to provide a basis for critical evaluation or a categorization of this new<br />\ndevelopment and labeled it \"psychedelic\" for lack<br />\nof a better word.

Morrison<br />\n\u2022 puts on his mask again after looking bored. \"Mother, I'd like to . . .

It was very interesting that<br />\nthe Times did the article on the<br />\ngirl who was murdered. It was kind<br />\nof nauseating. In a way it is interesting to read that ;let mother<br />\nstill refers to her daughter in the<br />\npresent tense. And they did this<br />\nincredibly sentimental thing about<br />\nputting this one part in italics, the<br />\nbad part. This double life that this<br />\nchick has, as though she were the<br />\nfirst to lie to their parents. I wonder if the family was insulted by<br />\nthat. They were terribly exploited<br />\nby that whole article; like its the<br />\nworst kind of Daily News sensationalism. I wondered why the<br />\nTimes didn't run the same kind of<br />\narticle on one of the accused murderers. Go back to see his mother<br />\nor his father and dig out the whole<br />\nstory. They should trace a child<br />\ngrowing up in a black community<br />\nand his reactions to the hippies.<br />\nThat would really be worthwhile.<br />\nBut, I don't think the Times will<br />\ndo that - - I wonder sometimes<br />\nwhere they get their reporters.<br />\nLike today, for instance, they ended a long article on the Joan Baez<br />\narrest, and in the last paragraph<br />\nthey said that there was a marijuana smell around her.

Three did<br />\ntheir prize-winning work at Cal<br />\nTech and three laureates are still<br />\nthere. Berkeley gave six of the<br />\nlaureates their Ph. D.'s. Seven winners did their, major work there and<br />\nBerkeley now sports eight prize<br />\nwinners. Harvard trained eleven<br />\nlaureates and fourteen prizes were<br />\nwon for work 'done in Cambridge.<br />\nSeven winners now reside there.<br />\nJohns Hopkins trained six Nobel<br />\nPrize winners. None did their work<br />\nhere and none are here now.<br />\nDoes this absence of laureates<br />\nconstitute a lack in the Hopkins<br />\nCommunity? Dr. Richard Macksey,<br />\nProfessor of Humanities, thinks<br />\nthat perhaps it does,although such<br />\nan absence cannot be the sole<br />\ncriterion for judging the excellence<br />\nof a faculty. \"I certainly would<br />\nhave been worried if we hadn't<br />\ntrained any of them, though.\"Certainly,\" he says,\"it would<br />\nbe nice to have some monuments<br />\naround.- But although \"any university can buy one or two laureates, they may be, in fact, empty<br />\nshells by the time they are bought.\"<br />\nDr. Macksey went on to say<br />\nthat the fact that I lopkins has not<br />\nbeen able to keep its people is relevant in judging the .University.<br />\nDr. Allyn Kimball, Dean of Arts<br />\nand Sciences, pointed out the fact<br />\nthat the problem is ;tot necessarily<br />\nkeeping the people. Instead, it is<br />\nrecognizing talent and getting it<br />\nfrom wherever it is at the time.<br />\nHe cites the case of Harvard, which<br /><br />\nnever hires the people whom it<br />\nawards Ph.D.'s. \"They let them<br />\ngo, and in a few years, if they<br />\nlook good, get them back.\"<br />\nReasons Why<br />\nThere are several reasons why<br />\nHopkins has had no laureate work<br />\ndone, and has no prize winners on<br />\nits staff. The first disadvantage<br />\nfrom which the school suffers is a<br />\nlack of funds. Many departments<br />\ndo not have enough money to<br />\noperate normally, much less expand their programs. Also, equipment for the departments is very<br />\nhard to finance. Thus, many people, especially in the sciences, are<br />\nforced to leave for lack of equipment. Dr. Macksey cited the National Institute of Health and the<br />\nNational Science Foundation as<br />\ncontributors of funds and the \"salvation\" of many departments at<br />\nHopkins. Ile says that the University's proximity to/ Washington<br /><br />\nhelps it obtain funds from the two<br />\norganizations.<br />\nAnother problem, closely related to that of finances, is the lack<br />\nof size and scope in the school. Dr.<br />\nKimball states, \"The Long-Range<br />\nPlanning Committee report showed us that we were too small.- He<br />\nsays that in a department with<br />\nonly five people, such. as the Near<br />\nEastern Studies Department \"if<br />\none person leaves, it leaves an entire area of study wiped out.-<br /><br />\nPyramid Structure<br />\nDr. Macksey points out that<br />\nHopkins has trouble enticing the<br />\nFinally, Hopkins has traditionbest people to come because the ally pursued a policy of training,<br />\ndepartments are too narrow.
