Meet Of Success<br />\n<br />\nJay Walks<br />\n<br />\nSeveral Hopkins Natators To<br />\nKeep In Shape Until April<br />\n5; Jay Relay Team Ready<br />\nWith only the South Atlantics in<br />\nfront of them, the Jay natators have<br />\ncompleted a rather<br />\n<br />\nmediocre dual<br />\n<br />\nmeet season, dropping five of their<br />\nseven engagements. The Jays were<br />\nvictorious only over Villanova and<br />\nGeorge Washington, while they dropped encounters to Franklin and<br />\nMarshall, Lafayette, Delaware, Virginia, and Manhattan.<br />\nAlthough Hopkins did not show up<br />\nso well in the won and lost columns,<br />\nseveral individual performances were<br />\noutstanding, with two new records<br />\nbeing established. These were accounted for by Bill Hazlett and Johnny MacGill.<br />\nHazlett set up a new mark in his<br />\nspecialty, the 200-yard breaststroke,<br />\nin the Villanova contest, which the<br />\nJays captured 30-20. Bill led home<br />\nthe opposition by almost twenty yards<br />\ncovering the distance in 2m. 47s. The<br />\nold record was held by Eddie Sadtler,<br />\nlast year's captain, at 2:5 1-4. Hazlett was defeated in only two meets<br />\nthis season, securing first places in<br />\n5 of the 7 engagements in which the<br />\nteam participated.<br />\nBackstroke Mark Falls<br />\nThe backstroke mark took a severe lacing, as three times a Jay natator succeeded in hitting a new low<br />\nfor the event. While Johnny MacGill<br />\naccounted for the final time of 1:55.0.<br />\nDan Weiner started the proceedings<br />\nwith a 1:57 in the first meet of the<br />\nyear with Lafayette, as compared<br />\nwith the record of 1:59. Weiner's<br />\ntime withstood the dorsal assaults<br />\nuntil the G. W. encounter, when MacGill stroked through to victory in<br />\n1:55.2.<br />\nThe Hopkins high-point scorer was<br />\nLou Adler, sprint star, who showed<br />\ngreat consistency throughout the<br />\ncampaign. Adler made his best record in the 100-yard dash. obtaining<br />\n3 wins and 3 seconds in the 6 century<br />\nswims in which he competed. This<br />\nrecord, in addition to 15 points scored<br />\nin the 50-yard dash, accounted for his<br />\nhigh total of 42 markers.<br />\nKoenig, McConnell Star<br />\nBill Koenig and Capt. Bill McConnell formed a consistent pair in the<br />\ndiving, managing to secure at least<br />\n3 points in every engagement. The<br />\nformer turned in a fine performance<br />\nagainst Manhattan, winning the event<br />\nby a narrow margin from Stadelberger, the New York ace.<br />\nBill Bishop, Don Noonan, Charlie<br />\nJones, Eddie Scheer, and Buddy Adler were the other Hopkins swimmers<br />\nwho aided the team considerably<br />\nthroughout the season. Bishop joined<br />\nup with Hazlett in the breaststroke,<br />\nand usually placed second to his teammate. Don Noonan, and Charlie Jones<br />\ncompeted for the Black and Blue in<br />\nthe sprint and relay; Eddie Scheer<br />\nrepresented Hopkins in the 220 and<br />\nrelay; while Bud Adler performed in<br />\nthe 220 and 440-yard races.<br />\nCoach Hambleton's men inaugurated their season inauspiciously, succumbing to the Lafayette aggregation by the score of 44-24.<br />\nThe<br />\nBlack and Blue had received a severe<br />\nblow when Capt. Woody White left<br />\nschool, and this occurrence, in addition to the fact that the team had<br />\nhad insufficient practice, handicapped<br />\nHopkins greatly in their meet with<br />\nthe Quakers.<br />\nManhattan Meet Close<br />\nUndoubtedly, the closest contest of<br />\nthe year was the one with Manhattan. The Jays scored as many points<br />\nas their opponents, the final count<br />\nbeing 34-34, but in accordance with<br />\nIntercollegiate rules, the New Yorkers' victory in the relay automatically gave them the meet. The Black<br />\nand Blue captured the breaststroke,<br />\nbackstroke and dive, Manhattan taking every free-style event.<br />\nIt is undecided as to whether or not<br />\nHopkins will put a complete squad in<br />\nthe South Atlanticc, but several Jay<br />\nnatators will definitely compete. Lou<br />\nAdler will swim in the sprints; Don<br />\nWeiner and John MacGill will team<br />\nup in the backstroke; and Bud Adler<br />\nwill race in the 220. In all probability, a Jay relay team will be entered,<br />\nand several other Black and Blue<br />\nmembers are considering performing<br />\nIn their specialties.<br />\n<br />\nDr. Shaffer told me last Saturday<br />\nafternoon he counted 250 people engaged in some sort of athletic activity in and around the gym at one<br />\ntime. During the course of the afternoon there were probably 50 or so<br />\nmore men in the gym, which means<br />\nthat over a third of the undergraduate<br />\nenrollment was taking advantage of<br />\nthe opportunities offered by the rerevamped administration.<br />\nI don't want to give the impression<br />\nof having deteriorated into a press<br />\nagent for these men (no implications<br />\nmeant), but it must be pointed out<br />\nthat this is really a magnificent<br />\nachievement. Effervescent and optimistic as fresh administrations always are at heart, the new Department of Physical Training and Athletics never hoped to realize such success the first year as that exemplified<br />\nby the statement in the previous paragraph.<br />\nIt is by such concrete demonstrations of student interest as this that<br />\nathletic budgets are increased, that<br />\nprovisions are made to equip more<br />\nmen for more sports. But Hopkins,<br />\nhard-pressed financially, can increase<br />\nthe athletic appropriations only to a<br />\ncertain extent. The rest must come<br />\nfrom alumni contributions labeled exmust be some alumni interested in<br />\npressly for an athletic fund. There<br />\nJay sports and able to back up their<br />\ninterest with something palpable.<br />\n0-0<br />\n<br />\nLean Years<br />\nAhead?<br />\nFrank Dotterweich is in the process<br />\nof completing an ambitious and meaty<br />\nschedule for the yearling stickmen.<br />\nWhen completed, the schedule will<br />\nprobably include about 12 games,<br />\nFrank says. This in itself is enough<br />\nto turn the varsity several shades of<br />\ngreen. But there is another point.<br />\nMore out-of-town men than ever before have come out to learn something<br />\nabout lacrosse. Most of them have<br />\nnever even seen a lacrosse game, but,<br />\nimpelled by a new spirit that has<br />\nmade a democracy of athletics, they<br />\nhave come out for a Hopkins team.<br />\nThe enthusiasm that anyone who<br />\nplays the game is bound to get will<br />\nbe carried by them back to their home<br />\ntowns\u2014to Passaic, to the Bronx, to<br />\nBrooklyn, to Newark, and so on. Clem<br />\nSpring, St. John's attack man of five<br />\nyears ago, did that very thing. These<br />\nHopkins men will do the same thing.<br />\nLacrosse will take root in their home<br />\ntown high schools, and pretty soon<br />\nthe northern colleges will creep up<br />\non Maryland.<br />\nThis means that interest in varsity<br />\nlacrosse at Hopkins will have to be<br />\nstrengthened. It is no secret that we<br />\ndidn't get our fair share of local high<br />\nschool stars this year. The reason was<br />\nthe uncertainty of football here. Most<br />\nlacrosse men are also football men.<br />\nThey would like to play the grid game<br />\nin college as well as lacrosse. Jay<br />\nfootball was dangling in mid-air this<br />\npast summer, so the lacrosse men who<br />\nwanted their football, too, went some<br />\nplace else.<br />\n0--0<br />\n<br />\nFirst Step<br />\nTo Fat Years<br />\nThe remedy for this is a live-wire<br />\npublicity department. Football has<br />\n\u2022been put on a sound basis\u2014there is<br />\nnothipig ambiguous about the Jay<br />\npolicy in that regard any longer.<br />\nWhy not drive the point home?

One article is easily overlooked. I have talked<br />\nwith a lot of our local shc)olboys who<br />\nhave asked me to explain the situation to them. They didn't know and<br />\nthere are a lot more who still don't<br />\nknow.<br />\nThere are all sorts of copy that<br />\nmight be sent to the local papers amplifying the positiveness of Hopkins<br />\nfootball.

Washington, Maryland and<br />\nHopkins. Although head coach of lacrosse, Kelso Morrill, did not attend,<br />\nHopkins was well represented by Ed<br />\nLotz and Gardner Mallonee.<br />\nSome of the more important<br />\nchanges follow:<br />\n1. If a player not participating in<br />\nthe play goes off side, he is called<br />\nback on his side and not penalized.<br />\n2. A ball, going out of bounds on<br />\nthe fly, shall go to the side opposite<br />\nthe one that caused it to go out of<br />\nbounds.<br />\n3. A ball rolling out of bounds shall<br />\nbe given to the man first reaching the<br />\npoint where it went out of bounds.<br />\nIt is hoped that these changes will<br />\neliminate all former conflicts over the<br />\ninterpretations of the former rules.<br />\n<br />\nGrad Volleyball<br />\nLeague Formed<br />\nDr. Trott Organizes League<br />\nIncluding Eight Teams;<br />\nInterest In Game Is Keen<br />\nA volleyball league, under the supervision of Dr. Richard Trott, has<br />\nbeen formed for graduate students<br />\nand teachers, and includes eight<br />\nteams.<br />\nThose that are competing are the<br />\nMathematics, Geology, Engineer, Biology, Psychology History, Romance<br />\nLanguage, and Chemistry teams.<br />\nAll of the players on the teams are<br />\nnovices at the game but are rapidly<br />\nlearning the fine points.

Meet Of Success<br /><br />\nJay Walks<br /><br />\nSeveral Hopkins Natators To<br />\nKeep In Shape Until April<br />\n5; Jay Relay Team Ready<br />\nWith only the South Atlantics in<br />\nfront of them, the Jay natators have<br />\ncompleted a rather<br /><br />\nmediocre dual<br /><br />\nmeet season, dropping five of their<br />\nseven engagements. The Jays were<br />\nvictorious only over Villanova and<br />\nGeorge Washington, while they dropped encounters to Franklin and<br />\nMarshall, Lafayette, Delaware, Virginia, and Manhattan.<br />\nAlthough Hopkins did not show up<br />\nso well in the won and lost columns,<br />\nseveral individual performances were<br />\noutstanding, with two new records<br />\nbeing established. These were accounted for by Bill Hazlett and Johnny MacGill.<br />\nHazlett set up a new mark in his<br />\nspecialty, the 200-yard breaststroke,<br />\nin the Villanova contest, which the<br />\nJays captured 30-20. Bill led home<br />\nthe opposition by almost twenty yards<br />\ncovering the distance in 2m. 47s. The<br />\nold record was held by Eddie Sadtler,<br />\nlast year's captain, at 2:5 1-4. Hazlett was defeated in only two meets<br />\nthis season, securing first places in<br />\n5 of the 7 engagements in which the<br />\nteam participated.<br />\nBackstroke Mark Falls<br />\nThe backstroke mark took a severe lacing, as three times a Jay natator succeeded in hitting a new low<br />\nfor the event. While Johnny MacGill<br />\naccounted for the final time of 1:55.0.<br />\nDan Weiner started the proceedings<br />\nwith a 1:57 in the first meet of the<br />\nyear with Lafayette, as compared<br />\nwith the record of 1:59. Weiner's<br />\ntime withstood the dorsal assaults<br />\nuntil the G. W. encounter, when MacGill stroked through to victory in<br />\n1:55.2.<br />\nThe Hopkins high-point scorer was<br />\nLou Adler, sprint star, who showed<br />\ngreat consistency throughout the<br />\ncampaign. Adler made his best record in the 100-yard dash. obtaining<br />\n3 wins and 3 seconds in the 6 century<br />\nswims in which he competed. This<br />\nrecord, in addition to 15 points scored<br />\nin the 50-yard dash, accounted for his<br />\nhigh total of 42 markers.<br />\nKoenig, McConnell Star<br />\nBill Koenig and Capt. Bill McConnell formed a consistent pair in the<br />\ndiving, managing to secure at least<br />\n3 points in every engagement. The<br />\nformer turned in a fine performance<br />\nagainst Manhattan, winning the event<br />\nby a narrow margin from Stadelberger, the New York ace.<br />\nBill Bishop, Don Noonan, Charlie<br />\nJones, Eddie Scheer, and Buddy Adler were the other Hopkins swimmers<br />\nwho aided the team considerably<br />\nthroughout the season. Bishop joined<br />\nup with Hazlett in the breaststroke,<br />\nand usually placed second to his teammate. Don Noonan, and Charlie Jones<br />\ncompeted for the Black and Blue in<br />\nthe sprint and relay; Eddie Scheer<br />\nrepresented Hopkins in the 220 and<br />\nrelay; while Bud Adler performed in<br />\nthe 220 and 440-yard races.<br />\nCoach Hambleton's men inaugurated their season inauspiciously, succumbing to the Lafayette aggregation by the score of 44-24.<br />\nThe<br />\nBlack and Blue had received a severe<br />\nblow when Capt. Woody White left<br />\nschool, and this occurrence, in addition to the fact that the team had<br />\nhad insufficient practice, handicapped<br />\nHopkins greatly in their meet with<br />\nthe Quakers.<br />\nManhattan Meet Close<br />\nUndoubtedly, the closest contest of<br />\nthe year was the one with Manhattan. The Jays scored as many points<br />\nas their opponents, the final count<br />\nbeing 34-34, but in accordance with<br />\nIntercollegiate rules, the New Yorkers' victory in the relay automatically gave them the meet. The Black<br />\nand Blue captured the breaststroke,<br />\nbackstroke and dive, Manhattan taking every free-style event.<br />\nIt is undecided as to whether or not<br />\nHopkins will put a complete squad in<br />\nthe South Atlanticc, but several Jay<br />\nnatators will definitely compete. Lou<br />\nAdler will swim in the sprints; Don<br />\nWeiner and John MacGill will team<br />\nup in the backstroke; and Bud Adler<br />\nwill race in the 220. In all probability, a Jay relay team will be entered,<br />\nand several other Black and Blue<br />\nmembers are considering performing<br />\nIn their specialties.<br /><br />\nDr. Shaffer told me last Saturday<br />\nafternoon he counted 250 people engaged in some sort of athletic activity in and around the gym at one<br />\ntime. During the course of the afternoon there were probably 50 or so<br />\nmore men in the gym, which means<br />\nthat over a third of the undergraduate<br />\nenrollment was taking advantage of<br />\nthe opportunities offered by the rerevamped administration.<br />\nI don't want to give the impression<br />\nof having deteriorated into a press<br />\nagent for these men (no implications<br />\nmeant), but it must be pointed out<br />\nthat this is really a magnificent<br />\nachievement. Effervescent and optimistic as fresh administrations always are at heart, the new Department of Physical Training and Athletics never hoped to realize such success the first year as that exemplified<br />\nby the statement in the previous paragraph.<br />\nIt is by such concrete demonstrations of student interest as this that<br />\nathletic budgets are increased, that<br />\nprovisions are made to equip more<br />\nmen for more sports. But Hopkins,<br />\nhard-pressed financially, can increase<br />\nthe athletic appropriations only to a<br />\ncertain extent. The rest must come<br />\nfrom alumni contributions labeled exmust be some alumni interested in<br />\npressly for an athletic fund.

This in itself is enough<br />\nto turn the varsity several shades of<br />\ngreen. But there is another point.<br />\nMore out-of-town men than ever before have come out to learn something<br />\nabout lacrosse. Most of them have<br />\nnever even seen a lacrosse game, but,<br />\nimpelled by a new spirit that has<br />\nmade a democracy of athletics, they<br />\nhave come out for a Hopkins team.<br />\nThe enthusiasm that anyone who<br />\nplays the game is bound to get will<br />\nbe carried by them back to their home<br />\ntowns\u2014to Passaic, to the Bronx, to<br />\nBrooklyn, to Newark, and so on. Clem<br />\nSpring, St. John's attack man of five<br />\nyears ago, did that very thing. These<br />\nHopkins men will do the same thing.<br />\nLacrosse will take root in their home<br />\ntown high schools, and pretty soon<br />\nthe northern colleges will creep up<br />\non Maryland.<br />\nThis means that interest in varsity<br />\nlacrosse at Hopkins will have to be<br />\nstrengthened. It is no secret that we<br />\ndidn't get our fair share of local high<br />\nschool stars this year. The reason was<br />\nthe uncertainty of football here. Most<br />\nlacrosse men are also football men.<br />\nThey would like to play the grid game<br />\nin college as well as lacrosse. Jay<br />\nfootball was dangling in mid-air this<br />\npast summer, so the lacrosse men who<br />\nwanted their football, too, went some<br />\nplace else.<br />\n0--0<br /><br />\nFirst Step<br />\nTo Fat Years<br />\nThe remedy for this is a live-wire<br />\npublicity department. Football has<br />\n\u2022been put on a sound basis\u2014there is<br />\nnothipig ambiguous about the Jay<br />\npolicy in that regard any longer.<br />\nWhy not drive the point home?

One article is easily overlooked. I have talked<br />\nwith a lot of our local shc)olboys who<br />\nhave asked me to explain the situation to them. They didn't know and<br />\nthere are a lot more who still don't<br />\nknow.<br />\nThere are all sorts of copy that<br />\nmight be sent to the local papers amplifying the positiveness of Hopkins<br />\nfootball.

Washington, Maryland and<br />\nHopkins. Although head coach of lacrosse, Kelso Morrill, did not attend,<br />\nHopkins was well represented by Ed<br />\nLotz and Gardner Mallonee.<br />\nSome of the more important<br />\nchanges follow:<br />\n1. If a player not participating in<br />\nthe play goes off side, he is called<br />\nback on his side and not penalized.<br />\n2. A ball, going out of bounds on<br />\nthe fly, shall go to the side opposite<br />\nthe one that caused it to go out of<br />\nbounds.<br />\n3. A ball rolling out of bounds shall<br />\nbe given to the man first reaching the<br />\npoint where it went out of bounds.<br />\nIt is hoped that these changes will<br />\neliminate all former conflicts over the<br />\ninterpretations of the former rules.<br /><br />\nGrad Volleyball<br />\nLeague Formed<br />\nDr. Trott Organizes League<br />\nIncluding Eight Teams;<br />\nInterest In Game Is Keen<br />\nA volleyball league, under the supervision of Dr. Richard Trott, has<br />\nbeen formed for graduate students<br />\nand teachers, and includes eight<br />\nteams.<br />\nThose that are competing are the<br />\nMathematics, Geology, Engineer, Biology, Psychology History, Romance<br />\nLanguage, and Chemistry teams.<br />\nAll of the players on the teams are<br />\nnovices at the game but are rapidly<br />\nlearning the fine points.
