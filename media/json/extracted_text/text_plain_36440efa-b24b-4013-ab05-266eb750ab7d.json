Eisenhower Symposium.<br />\nCreated in 1967 to honor the former university president, it is billed as \"an annual program of public interest.\" The symposium<br />\nhas since its inception attracted wellknown, quality speakers and has developed<br />\na fine reputation.<br />\nThis year is no exception. Chairmen Ranjit Bagga and Ujjal Goshtagore have<br />\nassembled an impressive roster of speakers<br />\non a timely and meaningful topic, our nation's deficit and its possible implications<br />\nfor our future. It is a well-conceived and<br />\nwell-planned venture and we have every expectation that it will succeed and be<br />\nremembered as a solid, if unspectacular,<br />\nmember of symposiums past.<br />\nCouncil announced this week that it is accepting applications for next year's symposium chairs. Along those lines, we'd like<br />\nto make a few recommendations.<br />\nFor many years now,the symposium has<br />\ntended toward more politically oriented<br />\ntopics. Indeed, any undergraduate now at<br />\nHopkins would never have seen any other<br />\ntype. This, however, doesn't have to be the<br />\n<br />\ncase\u2014it wasn't always. Past topics have included a sociological perspective on the role<br />\nof television within society and\u2014surprise\u2014<br />\nsex. Both were popular and incorporated<br />\nsubject areas other than hard-core political<br />\nscience-related issues.<br />\nThe point, then, is that the symposium<br />\nneed not be, and should not be, constrained by the boundaries of any one academic<br />\ndiscipline. It is one of the few opportunities<br />\nundergraduates have to strut their stuff to<br />\nthe Homewood and surrounding communities. As such, students ought not to limit<br />\nthemselves and look to as many other<br />\ndepartments as their interests dictate. Those<br />\nother areas deserve a chance to share the<br />\nspotlight.<br />\nSo, when students set about preparing<br />\nproposals in the coming weeks, we urge<br />\nthem to consider less obvious subjects.<br />\nWhy not examine medical ethics, or<br />\nperhaps a theme from the humanities?<br />\nThere is a veritable wealth of possibilities.<br />\nSurely a Hopkins student can put together<br />\na well-conceived topic with a non-political<br />\ncontext.<br />\n<br />\nA Self-Defeating Situation<br />\nThe difficulties experienced by the<br />\nPolitical Science Department as reported<br />\nthis week may come as a surprise to some.<br />\nAfter all, the majors of political science and<br />\ninternational relations combine to make the<br />\ndepartment the most popular among undergraduates. Further, the University is wellrenowned for its foreign and domestic<br />\ncenters for the study of political affairs.<br />\nApparently, it is presumptuous to assume<br />\nthat political science at Homewood,<br />\narguably the core of the University system,<br />\noperates as efficaciously as it should. The<br />\nproblems of the department are, at first<br />\nglance, of a purely mathematical nature.<br />\nThe number of students majoring in political science and international relations has<br />\nroughly doubled in the past few years,<br />\nwhile the number of faculty has remained<br />\nthe same. This translates into severe con-<br />\n<br />\ncerns for both parties. The students suffer<br />\nbecause of the necessarily higher class<br />\nenrollments and faculty/student ratios.<br />\nFaculty suffer as well from larger classes<br />\nwith increased burdens. Both faculty and<br />\nstudents want from the lack of interaction;<br />\nprofessors are unable to give time and<br />\ndirection, and students are deprived of mentor relationships, often forced to rely on<br />\nteaching assistants.<br />\nThe University must address this problem<br />\ndirectly\u2014it is inconceivable that the department with the most of undergraduate majors would want for anything, particularly<br />\nits most vital component\u2014professors.<br />\nDeficit or no deficit, the University must<br />\nrealize that to keep admitting larger<br />\nnumbers of poli sci majors is ultimately<br />\nself-defeating without making the necessary<br />\nimprovements in the department.<br />\n<br />\nOpinion<br />\nCooper: On Classics<br />\nI would like to correct some inaccuracies in your article on the<br />\nClassics Department, and to put<br />\nin context some of the remarks attributed to me.<br />\nIt was unfortunate that the article began with the quotation,<br />\n\"Even the best-intentioned dean<br />\nwould have trouble rebuilding the<br />\nClassics Department.\" Only a<br />\ncomplete and careful reading of<br />\nthe article would enable a reader<br />\nto reconstruct the context of that<br />\nstatement, which was as follows:<br />\nThe University is committed to<br />\nmaintaining Hopkins' strong<br />\ntradition of classical studies.<br />\nHowever, during the current<br />\nfinancial crisis, when departments and programs are scram-<br />\n<br />\nbling for pieces of an ever shrinking pie, even a dean who made<br />\nclassics his very top priority<br />\nwould not be immediately able to<br />\nspend the money necessary to<br />\nbring the department up to its<br />\nnormal complement of five fulltime faculty members.<br />\nLast year the Classics Department was not permitted to fill its<br />\nvacant position in classical archaeology, and so was reduced to<br />\nfour members. Two of those four.<br />\nresigned to take attractive positions elsewhere. Two regular<br />\nfaculty members remain, and one<br />\nvisitor has been hired to cover archaeology. The department has<br />\nalso hired one post-doctoral<br />\nfellow in historical linguistics,<br />\n<br />\nand one part-time visiting professor commutes weekly from<br />\nBryn Mawr to teach the Greek<br />\nseminar.<br />\nWhat is at stake for<br />\nundergraduates? As your article<br />\ncorrectly stated, a coherent<br />\ngraduate program cannot be<br />\nmaintained with only two faculty<br />\nmembers and a parade of visitors,<br />\nhowever capable or even<br />\ndistinguished. If good graduate<br />\nstudents don't come to Hopkins,<br />\nthe staffing of the beginning and<br />\nintermediate Greek and Latin<br />\ncourses is affected: they will be<br />\ntaught poorly or not at all.<br />\nBut more is at stake than inSee COOPER, 8<br />\n<br />\nIt's late on Saturday night and<br />\nyou, Joe Hopkins, are at a dying<br />\nfraternity party. The keg is almost<br />\nkicked, everyone who wanted to<br />\nbe in a fistfight has been, and<br />\nalthough you know you don't<br />\nreally want to go back to your<br />\napartment, the friends you came<br />\nwith are leaving and want to<br />\nknow if you're coming. You<br />\nfigure you'll stay and get a little<br />\ndrunker, maybe try to pick someone up.<br />\nYou graba beer and walk over<br />\nto Joanne Hopkins, who is talking with a girlfriend of hers<br />\nwhom you don't recognize.<br />\nYou've known Joanne since your<br />\nfreshman year, when she lived on<br />\nyour floor in the dorms. After<br />\nseveral long, philosophical<br />\ndiscussions with her in the middle of the night after colliding on<br />\nthe way to the bathroom, the two<br />\nof you became pretty good<br />\nfriends. You are always glad to<br />\nsee Joanne.<br />\nAfter a little while, Joanne's<br />\nfriend excuses herself with a wink<br />\nat Joanne, who rolls her eyes in<br />\nreturn. You hadn't really thought<br />\nabout it before, but it hits you<br />\nnow that Joanne is very attractive. You're both really drunk,<br />\nand she keeps leaning on you for<br />\nsupport, laughing and joking.<br />\nSince the party has become really lame and it's late, you ask her<br />\nif she'd like you to walk her<br />\nhome. You figure, what the hell?<br />\nShe looks for her friend, but she<br />\nis no longer here; Joanne shrugs<br />\nand says yeah, sure, walk me<br />\nhome.<br />\nThe two of you get to her apartment and soon are making out in<br />\nthe doorway. She doesn't seem as<br />\ninto it as you are, and it takes a<br />\nlittle while before she lets you in-<br />\n<br />\nto the apartment. But you're both<br />\nreally gone, and Joanne seems<br />\nwilling to go along with whatever<br />\nhappens. You're sure it's mutual<br />\nattraction.<br />\nWhat would you say if someone told you that you had just<br />\nraped Joanne? Most people, male<br />\nor female, would not consider what had happened rape.<br />\nThere was no physical struggle,<br />\nno slapping or hitting, no physical<br />\nviolence at all. But according to<br />\nMehala Vaidhyanathan, Lieutenant Governor of the Harbour<br />\nFront Division of Circle K International, rape may have occurred. Not date rape, neccessarily,<br />\nbut aquaintance rape. Is there a<br />\ndifference?<br />\n\"Yes,\" said Vaidhyanathan.<br />\n\"Acquaintance rape is not date<br />\nrape, but date rape is a torm of<br />\nacquaintance rape. Twenty percent<br />\nof all rapes are date rapes. That is<br />\nwhere a man and a woman are out<br />\non a date and end up in a rape<br />\nsituation. 75-80 percent of all<br />\nrapes are acquaintance rape. Acquaintance rape is when you are<br />\nraped by someone you know and<br />\nhave had contact with before.<br />\nThis can be a date rape.\"<br />\n\"The definition of rape is forced sexual behavior on another individual,\" she continues, \"It<br />\ndoes not have to lead to penetration.\"<br />\nWhat are the characteristics of<br />\nacquaintance rape?<br />\n\"The characteristics vary. It<br />\ncan be when a guy walks you<br />\nhome from a party, starts to get<br />\n'touchy feely' and you're too<br />\ndrunk to fight them off.

While<br />\nI agree wholeheartedly with the<br />\npoint of his letter, that our concerns for human rights should not<br />\nbe ideologically biased, I find<br />\nfault with many of the assertions<br />\nthat he makes and I feel that these<br />\ncannot go uncorrected.<br />\nMr. Marino's primary examples of nations which coil-pared to South Africa as \"equally deplorable\" are simply not internationally recognized as such.<br />\nWhen the 44th Session of the UN<br />\nHuman Rights Commission convened this year, it identified<br />\nSouth Africa, Chile, Israel, El<br />\nSalvador, Iran, and Afghanistan<br />\nas the primary violators of human<br />\nrights in the world. Cuba and<br />\nNicaragua, which figure prominently in Mr. Marino's discussion, actually received high<br />\nmarks in some crucial areas,<br />\nespecially when compared to<br />\ntheir pre-revolutionary governments. Similarly, Amnesty International's recently released report<br />\nof rights violations in 1987 makes<br />\ngrave charges against South<br />\nAfrica, but it does not make nearly the same sorts of criticisms of<br />\nNicaragua nor of Cuba.<br />\nThis is not an apology for<br />\nMarxist governments. AfghanSyria, and<br />\nistan, Iraq,<br />\nmany other Marxist states are<br />\nserious violators of human rights.<br />\nWhile Cuba and Nicaragua have<br />\nbeen cited with certain categories<br />\nof rights violations, these cannot<br />\nbe described as \"exterminations\"<br />\nas Marino does, nor can they be<br />\ncompared in scope or degree to<br />\nthose in South Africa.<br />\nFinally, it is worth considering<br />\nthe fact that this University does<br />\nnot invest its money in companies<br />\nwhich do business in Cuba. This<br />\nis because such investment is prohibited by a U.S. economic<br />\n<br />\nblockade. If Mr. Marino does<br />\nbelieve that Cuba and South<br />\nAfrica have \"equally deplorable\"<br />\nconditions, shouldn't a similar<br />\nblockade be enacted against South<br />\nAfrica?<br />\nJay Kaufman<br />\neliNANOVII.V.0.40%04.0ft<br />\n<br />\n\"Right Stuff\" Muller<br />\nci.the Editors:<br />\nThe recent conference on the<br />\nGerman Mind symbolized more<br />\nthan just prestige points for<br />\nHopkins. Besides assembling an<br />\nimpressively expert array of<br />\nthinkers, the forum gave President Muller the opportunity to<br />\nshine with his own ingeniously<br />\ndramatic conceptualization of the<br />\nconference's main issue.<br />\nInterrupting Dr. Habermas,<br />\narguably the foremost living German philosopher, to enable the<br />\npanel and audience to view<br />\nAmerica's space shuttle launch<br />\ndemonstrated perfectly what each<br />\nparticipant grappled with in<br />\npreparation for this conference:<br />\nhow political and historical issues<br />\nsuch as German Nationalism impact on a country's intellectual<br />\ndevelopment.<br />\nThroughout the morning,<br />\nMuller's eager updates on the<br />\nlaunch situation built the tension,<br />\nmasterfully setting the stage for<br />\nthe conferences' dramatic<br />\nculmination. Until, finally, in an<br />\nact of admirable humility, the<br />\npresident stepped aside and<br />\nallowed Dan Rather's triumphant<br />\ncall, \"America is back!\" to conclusively resolve the issue all<br />\nwere present to examine.<br />\nWho didn't feel like cheering at<br />\nsuch subtle yet effective artistry?<br />\nWhereas before the interruption<br />\nnone could be quite sure what impact such an intellectual conference could have on day to day<br />\nreality, afterwards not a soul was<br />\nin doubt.

The<br />\n'weather is turning cooler. The<br />\nleaves are beginning to fall. Paid<br />\nparking on campus is in full<br />\nbloom. Yes, the benevolent giant<br />\nthat is Johns Hopkins has solved<br />\nthose nasty old parking problems<br />\nof yesteryear for us with their<br />\nnew \"almost completely dehumanized\" paid parking system.<br />\nSo now on top of paying<br />\nthousands for tuition, we have the<br />\nprivilege of paying hundreds for<br />\nparking. Ah, but there are more<br />\nspaces now, I hear some administrator mumble. Oh, yes, the<br />\ncreation of U lot increases the<br />\ntotal number of spaces, but every<br />\nindividual lot on campus has had<br />\nits number of available spaces<br />\n<br />\nreduced significantly in order to<br />\nput in these lovely access gates<br />\nand huts.<br />\nYou know, many women I<br />\nknow used to feel somewhat<br />\nsecure about working in the evenings on campus since they could<br />\npark close to where they work.<br />\nBut now, since open parking<br />\ndoesn't start till 10 p.m., they'<br />\neither have to pay or stay home.<br />\nThat's too bad, since most of<br />\nthem only drive to campus, rather<br />\nthan walk, for safety reasons.<br />\nWell, at least there will be<br />\n<br />\nsome cash flow generated for<br />\nArts and Sciences. I suppose the<br />\nClassics Dept. can survive just as<br />\nwell on money derived from<br />\nparking fees as on money derived from a University commitment<br />\nto academic excellence; and<br />\nJohns Hopkins won't be looked<br />\ndown upon by the business community for not taking advantage<br />\nof this obvious money making<br />\nopportunity.<br />\nI can't wait till winter.<br />\nVincent J.

Is that good enough for<br />\nthe rest of us? For if the current<br />\nestimates of probable electoral<br />\ncollege results are anywhere near<br />\ncorrect, Dan Quayle may well be<br />\nthe next Vice-President of the<br />\nUnited States. This may be flogging a dead horse for the mediaweary public, but bear with me<br />\nfor a few paragraphs. One last<br />\nlook at Dan Quayle may lead to<br />\nsome interesting conclusions.<br />\nThose who watched the Vice<br />\nPresidential \"debate\" often<br />\nwitnessed Quayle's shifts into the<br />\n\"sacrificial lamb\" mode, the<br />\nstandard response whenever his<br />\nrecord is questioned. \"I have<br />\nnever professed to be anything<br />\nbut an average student,\" he said<br />\nhumbly. True. But \"average\"<br />\nmight be a generous evaluation of<br />\nlow \"C\" work at DePauw College in Indiana. Quayle also<br />\ndidn't mention flunking the qualifying exam in his major field,<br />\npolitical science. He was allowed to retake the exam\u2014strictly<br />\nagainst the college's rules\u2014but<br />\nhasn't explained how he managed that privilege. He graduated<br />\nwithout fulfilling all of the necessary requirements. How? It's<br />\nimpossible to tell. Senator<br />\n\"Most-Investigated\" Quayle has<br />\nhis academic records under lock<br />\nand key.<br />\nJump into the present tense:<br />\nQuayle has been undergoing intense programming and cramming with top Bush advisers ever<br />\nsince his nomination, a crash<br />\ncourse that requires him to adhere<br />\nstrictly to prepared scripts and to<br />\nhold no spontaneous Q and A sessions with reporters. If one works<br />\nunder the assumption that the Dan<br />\n<br />\nQuayle seen in the debate is close<br />\nenough to his finished product\u2014<br />\ngarbling answers, thumbing<br />\nthrough mental crib notes, hiding<br />\nbehind a high-powered weaponry<br />\nvocabulary\u2014the notion is<br />\ntroubling.<br />\nMost analysts agree, however,<br />\nthat Quayle's problem is a striking lack of maturity and what columnist Tom Wicker has called his<br />\n\"verbal infelicity.\" Flying off into spirited harangues, screaming<br />\nat his opponents' supporters,<br />\nQuayle has beaten a path of glaring blunders during this campaign, blunders which seem to<br />\nhave gone unnoticed. At one<br />\npoint, in Chicago, Quayle rejected his prepared script on<br />\ndefense issues, and made up a<br />\nspeech on the spot based on the<br />\nnovel,\"A Red Storm Rising,\" a<br />\nnovel about World War III. His<br />\naudience was first friendly, then<br />\npuzzled, then angry. On another<br />\noccasion, Quayle called the<br />\nHolocaust an obscene period in<br />\nour nation's history [my italics],<br />\nthen added \"I didn't live in this<br />\ncentury.\" Huh?<br />\nDan Quayle is not under the<br />\nmagnifying glass because people<br />\nare out to get him. He is there<br />\nbecause he does not appear to be<br />\nequipped to handle the VicePresidency. In addition to the<br />\ncuriousities mentioned above, he<br />\ndisplays an alarming lack of<br />\nknowledge about current politics<br />\n(he recently called 'perestroika'<br />\nnothing more than refined<br />\nStalinism) and his own<br />\nachievements (he has compared<br />\nhimself to Franklin Delano<br />\nRoosevelt and Winston Churchill<br />\namong others).

For example,<br />\nthe Luce Scholarship offers a one<br />\nyear tenure in Asia in an internship or job. The St. Andrew's<br />\nAward consists of $10,000 for<br />\none year of graduate study at a<br />\nScottish university.

Other awards frequently given to Hopkins students<br />\ninclude the Churchill, Fulbright,<br />\nMarshall, and Rhodes.<br />\nWhile most of the scholarships<br />\nare for juniors or seniors,<br />\nstudents should look into scholarship possibilities earlier, says Dr.<br />\nCatherine Evans. Not only should<br />\nstudents be aware that there are<br />\nscholarships out there, but they<br />\nshould learn the requirements and<br />\ndeadlines early. The Rhodes<br />\nScholarship, for instance, requires eight recommendations.<br />\nThe applications themselves<br />\nusually inquire about activities,<br />\nacademics and GPA,\"good<br />\ncharacter,\" and a well-thought<br />\nout project. Some also want<br />\nathletics. Most want the student<br />\nto specify exactly the \"who,<br />\nwhat, when, where, why, and<br />\nhow\" of their scholarship if<br />\nawarded. The scholarship committees want a strong sense of<br />\npurpose on the part of the student.<br />\nSome scholarships have other<br />\nrequirements as well. The Churchill, Fulbright, Luce, and<br />\nRhodes request applicants have a<br />\nB.A. You must be of Scottish<br />\ndescent to apply for the St. Andrew's. The Daad-Direktstipendien requires proficiency in<br />\nGerman and is not open to<br />\nstudents interest in medicine,<br />\ndentistry, or pharmacy. The<br />\nBeinecke, awarded only to<br />\n<br />\njuniors grants $2,000 for the<br />\nsenior year and $15,000 for each<br />\nof the first two years of graduate<br />\nstudy.<br />\nMost applications have to be in<br />\nby November 15 or earlier. The<br />\nWatson, Marshall, and Rhodes<br />\nhad their deadline on September<br />\n30. Students interested in the<br />\nDaad-Direktstipendien should<br />\nhave their applications in by October 21.

It fused hip hop<br />\nbeats with sharp allegorical raps<br />\nand simple guitar and keyboard<br />\nmelodies in singular fashion,<br />\ndefining a unique group sound. It<br />\nwas Jones' first album since his<br />\nenforced departure from the<br />\nClash and it was his chance to<br />\nshow them (actually, co-Clash<br />\nmate Joe Strummer)that he could<br />\nmanage just as well on his own.<br />\nAfter a similarly well-received<br />\nfollow-up, largely co-written with<br />\na reconciled Strummer, Jones has<br />\ndecided to alter his direction<br />\nsomewhat. Tighten Up Vol.88 attempts to strip down the structures of its songs, to lessen their<br />\nweight. The album's closing song<br />\n(and first single), \"Just Play<br />\nMusic,\" is somewhat of a<br />\nmanifesto in this regard. It is an<br />\nideal for a body of fun, uncomplicated music. \"I don't care<br />\n<br />\nby Phil Gochenour<br />\n<br />\nis the place to go 'cause you can<br />\nalways head next door to the CC<br />\nif you want to mellow out.<br />\nLast, and most certainly least,<br />\nis Cignel's, ostensibly the only<br />\nplace a Hopkins undergraduate<br />\ncan get in, since it's an all ages<br />\nclub with a juice bar.

A soundtrack<br />\nfor the Witching Hour, it continues in the same vein as<br />\nprevious works, presenting nine<br />\nbeautifully crafted productions<br />\ndetailing the dark fascinations of<br />\nsongwriters, Siouxsie Sioux and<br />\nSteven Severin.<br />\nPeepshow, however, seems to<br />\nbe a distillation of these interests.<br />\nThe band has always had a lyrical<br />\n(and musical) obsession with the<br />\nawful beauty of evil, but here<br />\nthey've gone beyond that and<br />\nhave written a set of songs that<br />\ntruly live up to the Banshees'<br />\n\"gothic rock\" appelation. Unlike<br />\nthose on previous albums, these<br />\nsongs don't really have individual<br />\nthemes as such. It's as if Sioux<br />\nand Severin decided to write<br />\nsongs in the form of three minute<br />\nhorror,stories\u2014The Banshees'<br />\npresent Tales from the Crypt.<br />\nMusically, the album is fairly<br />\nrepresentative of the Banshees'<br />\nsound though there are a few<br />\nnotable deviations. The first cut,<br />\n\"Peek-A-Boo,\" for example, indicates they've been listening to<br />\na bit of \"urban contemporary\"<br />\nradio. Its tape edited drum patterns, rubbery synth-bass line,<br />\nand chugging horns and accordian assimilate some of the<br />\naspects of hip-hop while remaining entirely within the Banshee<br />\ncanon. Ms. Sioux's vocal alternates between the sing-song of the<br />\nsong's tag line and a shrill<br />\ndescription of some demented<br />\ncarnival freak show. \"Burn Up\"<br />\nanother of Ms. Sioux's composi-<br />\n<br />\nFbRTSCAL<br />\nweek<br />\nWeekend<br />\nThis<br />\nWonderflix is running Baltimore<br />\nfave, Hairspray, director John<br />\nWaters' attempt at producing a<br />\n\"normal\" movie.

The<br />\nsong is, in every way, exactly the<br />\nkind of music Jones is singing<br />\nabout. \"You don't need to be<br />\nprofound/in fact don't speak/just<br />\nplay that sound.\" Jones is making a great point, especially for<br />\nthose people who've become<br />\nalmost anesthesized by unremittingly intellectualized music.<br />\nIn other songs this new approach doesn't work quite as<br />\nwell. At times, it seems Jones is<br />\nmistaking simple for simplistic.<br />\nTake for example, \"Hip, Neck,<br />\n& Thigh.\" It has a simple<br />\nmelody, a happy beat, and lyrics<br />\nconsisting of \"I rock, you<br />\nroll/Baby, I don't care/you rock,<br />\nI roll/stay and make a pair.\" Admittedly, it's no dumber than<br />\nyour average disco bubblegum<br />\nbut coming from someone who<br />\nwrote \"Hitsville U.K.\" it sounds<br />\nmore lazy than inspired. \"2000<br />\nShoes\" is another good example.<br />\nIt's an amusing but terribly outof-date number based on the life<br />\nand sales receipts of shoe-fetishist<br />\nImelda Marcos. It makes a stab<br />\nat political relevance but doesn't<br />\nbother to back it up with anything<br />\nmore than a passing thought.<br />\n<br />\nIn stripping the music down to<br />\nits bare bones and reducing the<br />\nlyrics to simple catchy phrases,<br />\none places a premium on true inspiration. Even a good mix can't<br />\nalways save a song, and it doesn't<br />\nsound as though Jones, who also<br />\nproduced the record, took the<br />\ntime to try. Still, Tighten Up does<br />\nhave its moments.<br />\n\"Applecart\" is a song about<br />\nthe plight of a working class married couple who suddenly realize<br />\nthey never took the time to get Ic.<br />\nknow each other. It's a beautiful<br />\npiece of pop craft with its synthesized string section and bittersweet refrain, \"Don't rock the<br />\nboat/upset the applecart.\" Other<br />\nhighlights include \"Rock Non<br />\nStop (All Night Long),\" \"The<br />\nBattle of All Saints Road\"(about<br />\nthe day the rockers and the rastas<br />\ngot together and played), and the<br />\ntitle track.<br />\nIn spite of its difficulties,<br />\nthere's a lot to listen to here.<br />\nEven when he's not trying to say<br />\nmuch of anything at all, Mick<br />\nJones has more to say than most.<br />\nAnd when he says as little as well<br />\nas he does on \"Just Play Music,\"<br />\nit's almost worth the price of admission itself.<br />\n<br />\n\f14/OCTOBER 14, 1988<br />\n<br />\nScience<br />\nThe high cost of Hopkins laboratory research<br />\nCopyright 1988, The Chronicle can be staggering.

Mr.<br />\n<br />\nFulghum is a teacher at The<br />\nLakeside Sch(x)I in Seattle, where<br />\nhe has taught drawing and painting for over twenty years.<br />\nThe genesis of Fulghum's book<br />\nwas an essay of the same title<br />\nwhich he delivered as a commencement address to a primary<br />\nschool class in Seattle. It is a few<br />\nsimple statements that make a<br />\ngood deal of sense.

Knopf<br />\n<br />\nby Pamela A. Marthinuss<br />\nA visit to an abortionist opens<br />\nthe story in \"False Starts,\" a<br />\nnovel by Terri McFerrin Smith.<br />\nThe novel's central character<br />\nMara is a young woman to whom<br />\nwe become introduced through a<br />\nvariety of short scenes that attempt to acquaint the reader with<br />\nbits of her past and to come to<br />\nsome understanding as to her present life. However, there is no<br />\nvisible chronlogical order as the<br />\nnovel darts back and forth in<br />\ntime, which leaves the reader in<br />\nconfusion.<br />\nA menagerie of characters<br />\nwhich visit each glimpse of<br />\nMara's life are thoughtlessly<br />\npresented. There seems to be no<br />\nmethod to the madness in which<br />\nMcFerrin Smith introduces the<br />\ncharacters. We are not told who<br />\nthese people are until the reader<br />\n<br />\nhas struggled through countless<br />\nvisits. People that reappear later<br />\nhave no connection to their earlier<br />\nappearances. Mara's father is an<br />\nalcoholic and her mother is addicted to food, but when we are<br />\nreintroduced to them, these<br />\ncharacteristics disappear. There is<br />\nno consistency in the characters.<br />\nTowards the end the characters<br />\ncome into sharper focus, but why<br />\nshould any reader have to wade<br />\nthrough one hundred or so pages<br />\nto understand a character that<br />\nwasn't very interesting to begin<br />\nwith?<br />\nMara, as the central character<br />\nis weak, one dimensional, and<br />\ndevoid of personality. Only once<br />\ndoes she stick up for her rights<br />\n(when she's discussing a<br />\nwoman's rights), but other than<br />\nthat Mara is a character who is<br />\nalong for the journey. Mara<br />\nallows the other characters to rule<br />\nthe pages. There are no motivations behind her actions, at least<br />\nto the reader, because McFerrin<br />\nSmith hasn't presented a clear<br />\nview into Mara's past or her present worlds. Mara doesn't react<br />\nto situations with any sort of fire<br />\nor personality\u2014there is nothing<br />\nshe really cares about except her<br />\ndaughter, who is born and raised<br />\nentirely in the last scenes of this<br />\n<br />\nnovel. Mara doesn't even care<br />\nabout herself. \"She was not accustomed to being listened to\" by<br />\nothers in the book, nor by the<br />\nreader. Probably the best advice<br />\nused by the author is a letter from<br />\nMara to her mother; finally, the<br />\nreader can grasp some sort of personality within Mara, but it<br />\ndoesn't last.<br />\nHowever, descriptions within<br />\n<br />\nsonal thoughts, but other opinions<br />\nseem to stray out of the air such<br />\nas a commentary on the scenery.<br />\nIs it McFerrin Smith? If so, why<br />\ndoes she enter at will, destroying<br />\nthe fragile coherency of this<br />\nnovel?<br />\nEvents occur that seem to have<br />\nno purpose. Why does Mara<br />\nleave Mac?

McFerrin Smith masterfully describes the scenic beauty<br />\nof Montana and Missouri, but<br />\nwhat is the purpose of beautiful<br />\nscenery when the characters don't<br />\nmake sense?<br />\nThere is no coherency to the<br />\nnarration in \"False Starts.\" Is it<br />\nMara? Is it the author? Both are<br />\na possibility, but the author cannot decide. We get Mara's per,<br />\n. k,<br />\n<br />\nWho are these characters?<br />\nMcFerrin Smith has a difficult<br />\ntime answering the basic questions that abound in this novel.<br />\nEither she ignores them by a<br />\nchronological jump or she glosses<br />\nover the events and goes on. Very<br />\ndisappointing.<br />\nThe author seems unable to use<br />\nsymbolism; either it is overused<br />\nor misrepresented. In one scene<br />\nMara throws away a plastic ring<br />\nthat her boyfriend has given her,<br />\nsupposedly telling the reader that<br />\nMara wants nothing more to do<br />\nwith him, but in the next scene<br />\nt_t \u00ea t k.s.. .4 1.i<br />\n<br />\nAi..4.it I 44<br />\n<br />\nMara is moving in with Mac.<br />\nWhy? Why does she leave him in<br />\nthe first place? Why does she get<br />\ntogether with him?<br />\nWith the end of the novel in<br />\nsight, there is finally some<br />\ncoherency as Mara attempts to<br />\nwork through problems of<br />\npregnancy, solitude, and unfaithfulness. When Mara decided<br />\nto raise the child instead of having another abortion, we see<br />\nsome semblance of maturity of a<br />\ncharacter whose age is never<br />\nmentioned. Then, the novelfinally achieves chronological order,<br />\nand that is reassuring to the<br />\nreader. The ending is unfulfilling<br />\nand suggests the author is unsure<br />\nnot only of her craft, but also of<br />\nhow to answer numerous problems that arise in this novel. The<br />\nreader is left with only a vague<br />\nidea of what has been accomplished by this novel, if<br />\nanything.<br />\nThe novel is a valiant attempt<br />\nby a first time author, but revisions with an eye towards a focused, coherent final product would<br />\nbenefit this novel immensely. The<br />\nmore I read, the more I was convinced that the novel would have<br />\nmade a great collection of short<br />\nstories.

They have<br />\nplayed brilliantly, holding their<br />\nopponents to an average of only<br />\n17 points per game while the<br />\nwishbone has managed only 18<br />\npoints in the first four games.<br />\nLast Saturday, the offense finally exploded for 28 points, but this<br />\ntime it was the defense that<br />\nfaltered as Ursinus used a balanced attack to upend Hopkins<br />\n34-28.<br />\nThe two teams traded touchdowns in the first half, with Brian<br />\nDulin running it in from 26 yards<br />\nout for Hopkins. The Bears,<br />\nhowever, took command in the<br />\nthird quarter with two<br />\ntouchdowns as they stretched<br />\ntheir lead to 19-7. It was in the<br />\nfourth quarter that the \"new<br />\nlook\" Blue Jay offense finally<br />\nbegan to click.<br />\nHopkins had been running the<br />\nwishbone all season, but were<br />\nunable to effectively use the<br />\nhalfback option. On Saturday, the<br />\nJays went back to the multiple set<br />\noffense they have used in past<br />\nseasons and had immediate success. Ironically, it was the option<br />\npasses and sweeps, the very plays<br />\nthat make the wishbone so deadly, that provided the big plays for<br />\nHopkins.<br />\nIn the fourth quarter, Gary<br />\nRupert led the Blue Jays on a<br />\npassing assault, combining most<br />\n<br />\noften with junior wide receiver<br />\nBrandon Rosser. Rosser, who<br />\ncaught six passes two weeks ago<br />\nagainst Gettysburg, had seven<br />\ncatches for 113 yards. Rupert<br />\ncapped off two beautiful Hopkins<br />\ndrives with TD runs to put the<br />\nJays in front 20-19. The Bears'<br />\nLou Haenel, however, returned<br />\nthe ensuing kickoff 80 yards for<br />\na touchdown, and after a two<br />\npoint conversion, Ursinus regained the lead 27-20.<br />\nThe rejuvenated Hopkins offense came right back on the next<br />\ndrive for yet another touchdown.<br />\nAfter freshman Eric Williams ran<br />\nthe ball in from 10 yards out,<br />\nRupert connected with Rosser for<br />\na two point conversion to give<br />\nHopkins a 28-27 lead with only<br />\n2:10 to play.<br />\nThe Blue Jay defense was<br />\nunable to hold, however, as Ursinus scored on a ten yard pass<br />\nfrom quarterback Brian Thomas<br />\nto Kevin Ross with only 33<br />\nseconds to play to take a 34-28<br />\nlead. Thomas was brilliant all<br />\nafternoon, as he burned the<br />\nHopkins secondary by completing<br />\n19 of 30 passes for 209 yards and<br />\nthree touchdowns. The Bears used a balanced attack all afternoon,<br />\nracking up 192 yards on the<br />\nground and 401 yards of total<br />\noffense.<br />\nSo yet again the Blue Jays were<br />\nunable to play well on both sides<br />\nof the ball as they fell to 0-5.<br />\nDespite their record, most of the<br />\nteam is keeping a fairly positive<br />\n<br />\noutlook on the rest of the season.<br />\n\"We're 0-5, but we don't<br />\nrealize it,\" said Rosser. \"We're<br />\na gocd team, and we have the<br />\ntaleneand potential to win. Last<br />\nweek was a turning point and a<br />\nconfidence builder for the offense. We just have to take it a<br />\nweek at a time.\"<br />\nThis week, the Blue Jays will<br />\nplay host to the Muhlenberg<br />\nMules. Last year, when the Mules<br />\nwent 7-3 and fielded eight allconference players, Hopkins<br />\nupset Muhlenberg 29-13 and<br />\nruined their homecoming.<br />\nQuarterback Chris Elser, an allCentennial selection last year,<br />\nreturned at QB and should provide<br />\na tough test for the Jays' defense.<br />\nSenior linebacker John Murphy<br />\nled a defense which surrendered 399 yards passing and<br />\n470 total yards to the Blue Jays<br />\nlast season. This Saturday's game<br />\nmarks the beginning of an extremely difficult four game<br />\nstretch for Hopkins, during which<br />\nthey will face such opponents as<br />\nDickinson, Georgetown, and<br />\nFranklin & Marshall. With only<br />\nfive games remaining, hopes of a<br />\n.500 record are extremely dim.<br />\n\"Our goal is to go 5-0,\" said<br />\nCoach Jerry Pfeifer. \"We know<br />\nthat's going to be tough to do, but<br />\nwe feel we can hit with anyone.\"<br />\nNotes: According to Pfeifer,<br />\nthe wishbone will resurface<br />\nperiodically throughout the rest of<br />\nthe season, but it will no longer<br />\nbe the main offense for the Jays.<br />\n<br />\nMuhlenberg is currently 3-2 with<br />\na 2-2 conference record, and they<br />\nare riding a two game winning<br />\nstreak.

Juniata is not expected<br />\nto beat Gettysburg, since Gettysburg beat Hopkins 3-1 and<br />\nHopkins beat Juniata 3-0, but the<br />\ngame is at Juniata and the home<br />\nteam has the talent to possibly<br />\npull out a close win.

Jackie Fatula scored on a<br />\npass from Meredith Blitz less than<br />\nthree minutes into the game, but<br />\n<br />\nafter that the offense fell apart.<br />\n\"We weren't very sharp, we<br />\ncouldn't get an attack going the<br />\nwhole first half,\" said Coach<br />\nAnderson. The Jays were still<br />\nable to score again, as Patti Ordonez pushed a ball off the<br />\ngoalie's pads into the goal, a play<br />\nset up by Blitz. \"Our players find<br />\na way to win,\" Anderson stated.<br />\nThe key to the victory was<br />\ngoalie Jennifer O'Hara, who had<br />\nfifteen saves in her fourth shutout<br />\nof the season.

Four racers, junior Udai<br />\nKammula, senior Kyu-Tae Lee,<br />\nand sophomores Chad Mynhier<br />\nand Chuck Young, gave their best<br />\non the dark and cloudy Labor<br />\nDay. The event opened with a<br />\n10K individual time trial (Ti'),<br />\nbetter known as the \"race of<br />\ntruth\" since this kind of race pits<br />\na solo rider against time.<br />\nHowever, a poorly marked turnaround point sent nearly half of<br />\nthe riders on an unexpected tour<br />\nof Harford county and made the<br />\n10K stage more like a 10 mile<br />\nstage. \"It was really disastrous,\"<br />\nrecounted Mynhier, \"but almost<br />\neveryone else missed the turnaround too, so there wasn't<br />\nmuch we oculd do except try to<br />\nrally back during the next two<br />\nstages.\" And rally back they did<br />\nduring stage two, a 22 mile road<br />\nrace that wound its way through<br />\nthe beautiful countryside of northern Maryland. However, none<br />\nof the racers had time to take in<br />\nthe scenery because near the<br />\n<br />\nseven mile mark a crash took<br />\ndown three riders, including<br />\nChuck Young. Ironically, it was<br />\nthis crash that launched Lee and<br />\nMynhier off the front. By the time<br />\nthe duo reached the line, the<br />\nnearest rider was still two minutes<br />\nback, and the rest of the pack, being controlled by Udai Kammula,<br />\nwas four minutes down. The final<br />\nstage was a 10 mile criterium<br />\naround a short half mile closed<br />\nloop course. Right off the start<br />\nLee and Young rolled off the<br />\nfront of the pack while Kammula<br />\nand Mynhier stayed back to slow<br />\ndown the rest of the field. Both<br />\nmanaged to lap the field for the<br />\nsecond Hopkins 1-2 finish of the<br />\nday, and Mynhier and Kammula<br />\nbrought it all home with a 3-4<br />\nfinish in the field sprint, making<br />\nit an all Hopkins sweep. The<br />\noverall standings for general<br />\nclassification(GC)saw Lee first,<br />\nMynhier second, Kammula<br />\nfourth, and Young eighth.<br />\nThe next race saw the biggest<br />\nHopkins turnout yet as ten<br />\nFighting Jays came out to duke it<br />\nout in the pack. The Eastern<br />\nShore Velo Club sponsored its<br />\nannual two day, three stage event<br />\nsee CYCLING, 23<br />\n<br />\nThe women's cross country<br />\ndisplayed its greatest team effort<br />\nof the season, as they won the<br />\nDickinson Invitational last Saturday. The Blue Jays finished first<br />\nout of nine teams, of which seven<br />\nwere MAC competitors. Hopkins<br />\nplaced five runners in the top<br />\ntwenty and emerged as one of the<br />\nfavorites in next month's MAC<br />\nChampionships.<br />\nMolly Bardsley led the Lady<br />\nJays with a time of 18:57, which<br />\nsecured her a second place medal<br />\nin the race. Anna Lee Bamforth<br />\nwas the next Hopkins runner to<br />\ncross the finish line in an impressive time of 19:45. Suzi<br />\nMcGinn turned in a gutsy performance, as she posted a time of<br />\n19:54, despite being quite ill.<br />\nDiana Logan became the fourth<br />\nHopkins runner to break the<br />\ntwenty minute barrier, as she ran<br />\nat 19:59 and improved on her<br />\ntime from last year by seven<br />\nminutes.

Hopkins<br />\ntook three of the top five spots as<br />\nBrian Brewer came flying in with<br />\na time of 20:32 to take first. Laing came in third, and Lee was<br />\nfifth.<br />\nHalf an hour later the field was<br />\nrolling along the road again, this<br />\ntime on an 18 mile road race. The<br />\nmain battle for control of the pack<br />\ntook place between Hopkins and<br />\nNavy, who also fielded a strong<br />\nteam. The race was marred with<br />\na crash that sent one rider to the<br />\nhospital. Luckily, no serious injuries occurred and all the Jays<br />\nmade it through unscathed. As the<br />\nfinal sprint came rolling arouild,<br />\n<br />\nLaing and Brewer picked up the<br />\npace in an effort to string out the<br />\npack so that some of the team's<br />\nsprinters would have a clearer<br />\nshot at winning. The teamwork<br />\npaid off as Lee came in for the<br />\nstage win, and Brewer still<br />\nmanaged to place fifth. At the end<br />\nof the day Lee was tied with<br />\nanother rider for first place in GC<br />\nand Laing was tied in second<br />\nplace with a rider from Navy.<br />\nThe next day brought on a<br />\nflurry of action in the final stage,<br />\na 36 mile road race. Four laps<br />\naround a 9 mile circuit brought<br />\nabout plenty of sprints as<br />\n\"primes\"<br />\n(pronounced<br />\n\"preems\"), usually time<br />\nbonuses, points, or prizes, were<br />\ngiven out to the first rider across<br />\nthe line on all but the first lap.<br />\nConsequently all the riders were<br />\nkeying in on winning the sprints.<br />\nNavy tried to send off a rider on<br />\na break to win the first prime, but<br />\nthe pack, led by Hopkins, reeled<br />\nhim in before he could get away.<br />\nThen with 400 meters to go,<br />\nBrewer let loose and came across<br />\nto take the first prime fo the day.<br />\nThe next time around Brewer<br />\nagain took off with another Jay,<br />\nChuck Young, but this time with<br />\nmore than a half mile to go.<br />\nSeveral Hopkins riders tried to<br />\nblock and slow down the peloton,<br />\nbut a strong chase by Navy reeled Brewer back in. Although<br />\nmost other riders would have<br />\ngiven up after being swallowed<br />\nup again, Brewer counter-attacked<br />\nand flew across the line to take<br />\nthe second prime, also. Then as<br />\nthe pack rolled around for the last<br />\nlap, the pace slowed as everyone<br />\n<br />\ntried to rest up for the final sprint<br />\nof the day, the one to win the<br />\nrace.<br />\nCome the final sprint Navy<br />\nended up taking the stage while<br />\nLee came in for second and<br />\nBrewer took fourth. Said Lee of<br />\nthe final spring,' It was a really<br />\nscary sprint. We were all lined up<br />\nacross the road so it was hard just<br />\ntrying to sprint around the slower<br />\nriders. On top of that the Navy<br />\nriders kept bumping me to try to<br />\nslow me down. In the final sprint<br />\none of them actually forced me<br />\ninto another rider.\"<br />\nAfter all was said and done,<br />\nHopkins still came out on top<br />\nwith Lee winning overall and<br />\nBrewer taking fifth. Navy took<br />\nsecond and fourth. \"I guess if<br />\nyou average things out, both<br />\nteams made out even, but we took<br />\nall of the prime sprints, too, so<br />\nI think we proved ourselves as a<br />\nstronger team,\" said Gurland.<br />\n\"Also the strength of our entire<br />\nteam was suprising, especially the<br />\nnewcomers to the team like Edwin (Dair) and Jon (Budelman).<br />\nAt the end of the race they were<br />\nall up there with the lead group<br />\nand hanging tough with the more<br />\nseasoned riders,\" aded Mynhier.<br />\nAll told the Hopkins Cycling<br />\nTeam brought home five overall<br />\nwins and four stage victories this<br />\nseason so far. But wait! There's<br />\nstill more action to come. Two<br />\nmore races are slated for the<br />\nseason before it comes to an end,<br />\nand at least one fun Fall Tour is<br />\nin the works so anyone interested<br />\nin riding and/or racing should<br />\ncontact either Lance or Kyu at<br />\n467-3203.<br />\n<br />\nWHAT IF YOU<br />\nDON'T GET<br />\nINTO THE GRAD<br />\nSCHOOL OF<br />\nYOUR CHOICE?<br />\n<br />\n1KAPLAN<br />\n<br />\nSTANLEY H.

That year,<br />\nforty students enrolled in the IR program<br />\nwhile thirty-one students enrolled in political<br />\nscience.<br />\nIn 1988, the figures jumped to 337 applicants expressing interest in IR and 196<br />\nstudents in political science.

One may be that students have<br />\ndiscovered \"our international studies and<br />\npolitical science options are among the finest<br />\nin the country.\" said Jerome Schnydman,<br /><br />\nJoe Crawford<br /><br />\nGermaine Hoston, director of undergraduate<br />\nstudies for political science, called the department's student-faculty ratio \"demoralizing\" for<br />\ninternational studies and political science majors.<br /><br />\ndirector of admissions.<br />\nAccording to Hoston, the rise can also be<br />\nattributed to the number of students who once<br />\npreferred to major in the social and behavioral<br />\nsciences, but have switched over to IR<br />\nbecause of new, stricter requirements for the<br />\nformer major.<br />\n\"We've reached a point where we have this<br />\ncrisis,\" said Hoston. \"Students are being<br />\nlocked out of classes that they have to take<br />\nfor their major. Their parents find out and put<br />\npressure on the administration. The administration in turn puts pressure on the faculty to take the enrollment limits off of their<br />\nclasses. But that's not going to solve the<br />\nproblem.\"<br />\nRichard Flathman, chairman of political<br />\nscience, added,\"You will unfortunately have<br />\nlarge enrollments in the intro-level courses as<br />\nwell as some of the 300-level courses.

Eisenhower Symposium.<br />\nCreated in 1967 to honor the former university president, it is billed as \"an annual program of public interest.\" The symposium<br />\nhas since its inception attracted wellknown, quality speakers and has developed<br />\na fine reputation.<br />\nThis year is no exception. Chairmen Ranjit Bagga and Ujjal Goshtagore have<br />\nassembled an impressive roster of speakers<br />\non a timely and meaningful topic, our nation's deficit and its possible implications<br />\nfor our future. It is a well-conceived and<br />\nwell-planned venture and we have every expectation that it will succeed and be<br />\nremembered as a solid, if unspectacular,<br />\nmember of symposiums past.<br />\nCouncil announced this week that it is accepting applications for next year's symposium chairs. Along those lines, we'd like<br />\nto make a few recommendations.<br />\nFor many years now,the symposium has<br />\ntended toward more politically oriented<br />\ntopics. Indeed, any undergraduate now at<br />\nHopkins would never have seen any other<br />\ntype. This, however, doesn't have to be the<br /><br />\ncase\u2014it wasn't always. Past topics have included a sociological perspective on the role<br />\nof television within society and\u2014surprise\u2014<br />\nsex. Both were popular and incorporated<br />\nsubject areas other than hard-core political<br />\nscience-related issues.<br />\nThe point, then, is that the symposium<br />\nneed not be, and should not be, constrained by the boundaries of any one academic<br />\ndiscipline. It is one of the few opportunities<br />\nundergraduates have to strut their stuff to<br />\nthe Homewood and surrounding communities. As such, students ought not to limit<br />\nthemselves and look to as many other<br />\ndepartments as their interests dictate. Those<br />\nother areas deserve a chance to share the<br />\nspotlight.<br />\nSo, when students set about preparing<br />\nproposals in the coming weeks, we urge<br />\nthem to consider less obvious subjects.<br />\nWhy not examine medical ethics, or<br />\nperhaps a theme from the humanities?<br />\nThere is a veritable wealth of possibilities.<br />\nSurely a Hopkins student can put together<br />\na well-conceived topic with a non-political<br />\ncontext.<br /><br />\nA Self-Defeating Situation<br />\nThe difficulties experienced by the<br />\nPolitical Science Department as reported<br />\nthis week may come as a surprise to some.<br />\nAfter all, the majors of political science and<br />\ninternational relations combine to make the<br />\ndepartment the most popular among undergraduates. Further, the University is wellrenowned for its foreign and domestic<br />\ncenters for the study of political affairs.<br />\nApparently, it is presumptuous to assume<br />\nthat political science at Homewood,<br />\narguably the core of the University system,<br />\noperates as efficaciously as it should. The<br />\nproblems of the department are, at first<br />\nglance, of a purely mathematical nature.<br />\nThe number of students majoring in political science and international relations has<br />\nroughly doubled in the past few years,<br />\nwhile the number of faculty has remained<br />\nthe same. This translates into severe con-<br /><br />\ncerns for both parties. The students suffer<br />\nbecause of the necessarily higher class<br />\nenrollments and faculty/student ratios.<br />\nFaculty suffer as well from larger classes<br />\nwith increased burdens. Both faculty and<br />\nstudents want from the lack of interaction;<br />\nprofessors are unable to give time and<br />\ndirection, and students are deprived of mentor relationships, often forced to rely on<br />\nteaching assistants.<br />\nThe University must address this problem<br />\ndirectly\u2014it is inconceivable that the department with the most of undergraduate majors would want for anything, particularly<br />\nits most vital component\u2014professors.<br />\nDeficit or no deficit, the University must<br />\nrealize that to keep admitting larger<br />\nnumbers of poli sci majors is ultimately<br />\nself-defeating without making the necessary<br />\nimprovements in the department.<br /><br />\nOpinion<br />\nCooper: On Classics<br />\nI would like to correct some inaccuracies in your article on the<br />\nClassics Department, and to put<br />\nin context some of the remarks attributed to me.<br />\nIt was unfortunate that the article began with the quotation,<br />\n\"Even the best-intentioned dean<br />\nwould have trouble rebuilding the<br />\nClassics Department.\" Only a<br />\ncomplete and careful reading of<br />\nthe article would enable a reader<br />\nto reconstruct the context of that<br />\nstatement, which was as follows:<br />\nThe University is committed to<br />\nmaintaining Hopkins' strong<br />\ntradition of classical studies.<br />\nHowever, during the current<br />\nfinancial crisis, when departments and programs are scram-<br /><br />\nbling for pieces of an ever shrinking pie, even a dean who made<br />\nclassics his very top priority<br />\nwould not be immediately able to<br />\nspend the money necessary to<br />\nbring the department up to its<br />\nnormal complement of five fulltime faculty members.<br />\nLast year the Classics Department was not permitted to fill its<br />\nvacant position in classical archaeology, and so was reduced to<br />\nfour members. Two of those four.<br />\nresigned to take attractive positions elsewhere. Two regular<br />\nfaculty members remain, and one<br />\nvisitor has been hired to cover archaeology. The department has<br />\nalso hired one post-doctoral<br />\nfellow in historical linguistics,<br /><br />\nand one part-time visiting professor commutes weekly from<br />\nBryn Mawr to teach the Greek<br />\nseminar.<br />\nWhat is at stake for<br />\nundergraduates? As your article<br />\ncorrectly stated, a coherent<br />\ngraduate program cannot be<br />\nmaintained with only two faculty<br />\nmembers and a parade of visitors,<br />\nhowever capable or even<br />\ndistinguished. If good graduate<br />\nstudents don't come to Hopkins,<br />\nthe staffing of the beginning and<br />\nintermediate Greek and Latin<br />\ncourses is affected: they will be<br />\ntaught poorly or not at all.<br />\nBut more is at stake than inSee COOPER, 8<br /><br />\nIt's late on Saturday night and<br />\nyou, Joe Hopkins, are at a dying<br />\nfraternity party. The keg is almost<br />\nkicked, everyone who wanted to<br />\nbe in a fistfight has been, and<br />\nalthough you know you don't<br />\nreally want to go back to your<br />\napartment, the friends you came<br />\nwith are leaving and want to<br />\nknow if you're coming. You<br />\nfigure you'll stay and get a little<br />\ndrunker, maybe try to pick someone up.<br />\nYou graba beer and walk over<br />\nto Joanne Hopkins, who is talking with a girlfriend of hers<br />\nwhom you don't recognize.<br />\nYou've known Joanne since your<br />\nfreshman year, when she lived on<br />\nyour floor in the dorms. After<br />\nseveral long, philosophical<br />\ndiscussions with her in the middle of the night after colliding on<br />\nthe way to the bathroom, the two<br />\nof you became pretty good<br />\nfriends. You are always glad to<br />\nsee Joanne.<br />\nAfter a little while, Joanne's<br />\nfriend excuses herself with a wink<br />\nat Joanne, who rolls her eyes in<br />\nreturn. You hadn't really thought<br />\nabout it before, but it hits you<br />\nnow that Joanne is very attractive. You're both really drunk,<br />\nand she keeps leaning on you for<br />\nsupport, laughing and joking.<br />\nSince the party has become really lame and it's late, you ask her<br />\nif she'd like you to walk her<br />\nhome. You figure, what the hell?<br />\nShe looks for her friend, but she<br />\nis no longer here; Joanne shrugs<br />\nand says yeah, sure, walk me<br />\nhome.<br />\nThe two of you get to her apartment and soon are making out in<br />\nthe doorway. She doesn't seem as<br />\ninto it as you are, and it takes a<br />\nlittle while before she lets you in-<br /><br />\nto the apartment. But you're both<br />\nreally gone, and Joanne seems<br />\nwilling to go along with whatever<br />\nhappens. You're sure it's mutual<br />\nattraction.<br />\nWhat would you say if someone told you that you had just<br />\nraped Joanne? Most people, male<br />\nor female, would not consider what had happened rape.<br />\nThere was no physical struggle,<br />\nno slapping or hitting, no physical<br />\nviolence at all. But according to<br />\nMehala Vaidhyanathan, Lieutenant Governor of the Harbour<br />\nFront Division of Circle K International, rape may have occurred. Not date rape, neccessarily,<br />\nbut aquaintance rape. Is there a<br />\ndifference?<br />\n\"Yes,\" said Vaidhyanathan.<br />\n\"Acquaintance rape is not date<br />\nrape, but date rape is a torm of<br />\nacquaintance rape. Twenty percent<br />\nof all rapes are date rapes. That is<br />\nwhere a man and a woman are out<br />\non a date and end up in a rape<br />\nsituation. 75-80 percent of all<br />\nrapes are acquaintance rape. Acquaintance rape is when you are<br />\nraped by someone you know and<br />\nhave had contact with before.<br />\nThis can be a date rape.\"<br />\n\"The definition of rape is forced sexual behavior on another individual,\" she continues, \"It<br />\ndoes not have to lead to penetration.\"<br />\nWhat are the characteristics of<br />\nacquaintance rape?<br />\n\"The characteristics vary. It<br />\ncan be when a guy walks you<br />\nhome from a party, starts to get<br />\n'touchy feely' and you're too<br />\ndrunk to fight them off.

While<br />\nI agree wholeheartedly with the<br />\npoint of his letter, that our concerns for human rights should not<br />\nbe ideologically biased, I find<br />\nfault with many of the assertions<br />\nthat he makes and I feel that these<br />\ncannot go uncorrected.<br />\nMr. Marino's primary examples of nations which coil-pared to South Africa as \"equally deplorable\" are simply not internationally recognized as such.<br />\nWhen the 44th Session of the UN<br />\nHuman Rights Commission convened this year, it identified<br />\nSouth Africa, Chile, Israel, El<br />\nSalvador, Iran, and Afghanistan<br />\nas the primary violators of human<br />\nrights in the world. Cuba and<br />\nNicaragua, which figure prominently in Mr. Marino's discussion, actually received high<br />\nmarks in some crucial areas,<br />\nespecially when compared to<br />\ntheir pre-revolutionary governments. Similarly, Amnesty International's recently released report<br />\nof rights violations in 1987 makes<br />\ngrave charges against South<br />\nAfrica, but it does not make nearly the same sorts of criticisms of<br />\nNicaragua nor of Cuba.<br />\nThis is not an apology for<br />\nMarxist governments. AfghanSyria, and<br />\nistan, Iraq,<br />\nmany other Marxist states are<br />\nserious violators of human rights.<br />\nWhile Cuba and Nicaragua have<br />\nbeen cited with certain categories<br />\nof rights violations, these cannot<br />\nbe described as \"exterminations\"<br />\nas Marino does, nor can they be<br />\ncompared in scope or degree to<br />\nthose in South Africa.<br />\nFinally, it is worth considering<br />\nthe fact that this University does<br />\nnot invest its money in companies<br />\nwhich do business in Cuba. This<br />\nis because such investment is prohibited by a U.S. economic<br /><br />\nblockade. If Mr. Marino does<br />\nbelieve that Cuba and South<br />\nAfrica have \"equally deplorable\"<br />\nconditions, shouldn't a similar<br />\nblockade be enacted against South<br />\nAfrica?<br />\nJay Kaufman<br />\neliNANOVII.V.0.40%04.0ft<br /><br />\n\"Right Stuff\" Muller<br />\nci.the Editors:<br />\nThe recent conference on the<br />\nGerman Mind symbolized more<br />\nthan just prestige points for<br />\nHopkins. Besides assembling an<br />\nimpressively expert array of<br />\nthinkers, the forum gave President Muller the opportunity to<br />\nshine with his own ingeniously<br />\ndramatic conceptualization of the<br />\nconference's main issue.<br />\nInterrupting Dr. Habermas,<br />\narguably the foremost living German philosopher, to enable the<br />\npanel and audience to view<br />\nAmerica's space shuttle launch<br />\ndemonstrated perfectly what each<br />\nparticipant grappled with in<br />\npreparation for this conference:<br />\nhow political and historical issues<br />\nsuch as German Nationalism impact on a country's intellectual<br />\ndevelopment.<br />\nThroughout the morning,<br />\nMuller's eager updates on the<br />\nlaunch situation built the tension,<br />\nmasterfully setting the stage for<br />\nthe conferences' dramatic<br />\nculmination. Until, finally, in an<br />\nact of admirable humility, the<br />\npresident stepped aside and<br />\nallowed Dan Rather's triumphant<br />\ncall, \"America is back!\" to conclusively resolve the issue all<br />\nwere present to examine.<br />\nWho didn't feel like cheering at<br />\nsuch subtle yet effective artistry?<br />\nWhereas before the interruption<br />\nnone could be quite sure what impact such an intellectual conference could have on day to day<br />\nreality, afterwards not a soul was<br />\nin doubt.

The<br />\n'weather is turning cooler. The<br />\nleaves are beginning to fall. Paid<br />\nparking on campus is in full<br />\nbloom. Yes, the benevolent giant<br />\nthat is Johns Hopkins has solved<br />\nthose nasty old parking problems<br />\nof yesteryear for us with their<br />\nnew \"almost completely dehumanized\" paid parking system.<br />\nSo now on top of paying<br />\nthousands for tuition, we have the<br />\nprivilege of paying hundreds for<br />\nparking. Ah, but there are more<br />\nspaces now, I hear some administrator mumble. Oh, yes, the<br />\ncreation of U lot increases the<br />\ntotal number of spaces, but every<br />\nindividual lot on campus has had<br />\nits number of available spaces<br /><br />\nreduced significantly in order to<br />\nput in these lovely access gates<br />\nand huts.<br />\nYou know, many women I<br />\nknow used to feel somewhat<br />\nsecure about working in the evenings on campus since they could<br />\npark close to where they work.<br />\nBut now, since open parking<br />\ndoesn't start till 10 p.m., they'<br />\neither have to pay or stay home.<br />\nThat's too bad, since most of<br />\nthem only drive to campus, rather<br />\nthan walk, for safety reasons.<br />\nWell, at least there will be<br /><br />\nsome cash flow generated for<br />\nArts and Sciences. I suppose the<br />\nClassics Dept. can survive just as<br />\nwell on money derived from<br />\nparking fees as on money derived from a University commitment<br />\nto academic excellence; and<br />\nJohns Hopkins won't be looked<br />\ndown upon by the business community for not taking advantage<br />\nof this obvious money making<br />\nopportunity.<br />\nI can't wait till winter.<br />\nVincent J.

Is that good enough for<br />\nthe rest of us? For if the current<br />\nestimates of probable electoral<br />\ncollege results are anywhere near<br />\ncorrect, Dan Quayle may well be<br />\nthe next Vice-President of the<br />\nUnited States. This may be flogging a dead horse for the mediaweary public, but bear with me<br />\nfor a few paragraphs. One last<br />\nlook at Dan Quayle may lead to<br />\nsome interesting conclusions.<br />\nThose who watched the Vice<br />\nPresidential \"debate\" often<br />\nwitnessed Quayle's shifts into the<br />\n\"sacrificial lamb\" mode, the<br />\nstandard response whenever his<br />\nrecord is questioned. \"I have<br />\nnever professed to be anything<br />\nbut an average student,\" he said<br />\nhumbly. True. But \"average\"<br />\nmight be a generous evaluation of<br />\nlow \"C\" work at DePauw College in Indiana. Quayle also<br />\ndidn't mention flunking the qualifying exam in his major field,<br />\npolitical science. He was allowed to retake the exam\u2014strictly<br />\nagainst the college's rules\u2014but<br />\nhasn't explained how he managed that privilege. He graduated<br />\nwithout fulfilling all of the necessary requirements. How? It's<br />\nimpossible to tell. Senator<br />\n\"Most-Investigated\" Quayle has<br />\nhis academic records under lock<br />\nand key.<br />\nJump into the present tense:<br />\nQuayle has been undergoing intense programming and cramming with top Bush advisers ever<br />\nsince his nomination, a crash<br />\ncourse that requires him to adhere<br />\nstrictly to prepared scripts and to<br />\nhold no spontaneous Q and A sessions with reporters. If one works<br />\nunder the assumption that the Dan<br /><br />\nQuayle seen in the debate is close<br />\nenough to his finished product\u2014<br />\ngarbling answers, thumbing<br />\nthrough mental crib notes, hiding<br />\nbehind a high-powered weaponry<br />\nvocabulary\u2014the notion is<br />\ntroubling.<br />\nMost analysts agree, however,<br />\nthat Quayle's problem is a striking lack of maturity and what columnist Tom Wicker has called his<br />\n\"verbal infelicity.\" Flying off into spirited harangues, screaming<br />\nat his opponents' supporters,<br />\nQuayle has beaten a path of glaring blunders during this campaign, blunders which seem to<br />\nhave gone unnoticed. At one<br />\npoint, in Chicago, Quayle rejected his prepared script on<br />\ndefense issues, and made up a<br />\nspeech on the spot based on the<br />\nnovel,\"A Red Storm Rising,\" a<br />\nnovel about World War III. His<br />\naudience was first friendly, then<br />\npuzzled, then angry. On another<br />\noccasion, Quayle called the<br />\nHolocaust an obscene period in<br />\nour nation's history [my italics],<br />\nthen added \"I didn't live in this<br />\ncentury.\" Huh?<br />\nDan Quayle is not under the<br />\nmagnifying glass because people<br />\nare out to get him. He is there<br />\nbecause he does not appear to be<br />\nequipped to handle the VicePresidency. In addition to the<br />\ncuriousities mentioned above, he<br />\ndisplays an alarming lack of<br />\nknowledge about current politics<br />\n(he recently called 'perestroika'<br />\nnothing more than refined<br />\nStalinism) and his own<br />\nachievements (he has compared<br />\nhimself to Franklin Delano<br />\nRoosevelt and Winston Churchill<br />\namong others).

For example,<br />\nthe Luce Scholarship offers a one<br />\nyear tenure in Asia in an internship or job. The St. Andrew's<br />\nAward consists of $10,000 for<br />\none year of graduate study at a<br />\nScottish university.

Other awards frequently given to Hopkins students<br />\ninclude the Churchill, Fulbright,<br />\nMarshall, and Rhodes.<br />\nWhile most of the scholarships<br />\nare for juniors or seniors,<br />\nstudents should look into scholarship possibilities earlier, says Dr.<br />\nCatherine Evans. Not only should<br />\nstudents be aware that there are<br />\nscholarships out there, but they<br />\nshould learn the requirements and<br />\ndeadlines early. The Rhodes<br />\nScholarship, for instance, requires eight recommendations.<br />\nThe applications themselves<br />\nusually inquire about activities,<br />\nacademics and GPA,\"good<br />\ncharacter,\" and a well-thought<br />\nout project. Some also want<br />\nathletics. Most want the student<br />\nto specify exactly the \"who,<br />\nwhat, when, where, why, and<br />\nhow\" of their scholarship if<br />\nawarded. The scholarship committees want a strong sense of<br />\npurpose on the part of the student.<br />\nSome scholarships have other<br />\nrequirements as well. The Churchill, Fulbright, Luce, and<br />\nRhodes request applicants have a<br />\nB.A. You must be of Scottish<br />\ndescent to apply for the St. Andrew's. The Daad-Direktstipendien requires proficiency in<br />\nGerman and is not open to<br />\nstudents interest in medicine,<br />\ndentistry, or pharmacy.

It<br />\nwas Jones' first album since his<br />\nenforced departure from the<br />\nClash and it was his chance to<br />\nshow them (actually, co-Clash<br />\nmate Joe Strummer)that he could<br />\nmanage just as well on his own.<br />\nAfter a similarly well-received<br />\nfollow-up, largely co-written with<br />\na reconciled Strummer, Jones has<br />\ndecided to alter his direction<br />\nsomewhat. Tighten Up Vol.88 attempts to strip down the structures of its songs, to lessen their<br />\nweight. The album's closing song<br />\n(and first single), \"Just Play<br />\nMusic,\" is somewhat of a<br />\nmanifesto in this regard. It is an<br />\nideal for a body of fun, uncomplicated music. \"I don't care<br /><br />\nby Phil Gochenour<br /><br />\nis the place to go 'cause you can<br />\nalways head next door to the CC<br />\nif you want to mellow out.<br />\nLast, and most certainly least,<br />\nis Cignel's, ostensibly the only<br />\nplace a Hopkins undergraduate<br />\ncan get in, since it's an all ages<br />\nclub with a juice bar.

Given the<br />\ncrowd and the music, I generally<br />\nthink of Cignel's as being like a<br />\ndress-in-black, faggy English<br />\nversion of Dance Party, USA.<br />\nCignel's is the Scene, where you<br />\ngo to see and be seen, but really,<br />\nwho gives a damn about being<br />\n\"seen\" by a bunch of sixteen<br />\nyear olds who are probably drunk<br />\nor stoned anyway?

A soundtrack<br />\nfor the Witching Hour, it continues in the same vein as<br />\nprevious works, presenting nine<br />\nbeautifully crafted productions<br />\ndetailing the dark fascinations of<br />\nsongwriters, Siouxsie Sioux and<br />\nSteven Severin.<br />\nPeepshow, however, seems to<br />\nbe a distillation of these interests.<br />\nThe band has always had a lyrical<br />\n(and musical) obsession with the<br />\nawful beauty of evil, but here<br />\nthey've gone beyond that and<br />\nhave written a set of songs that<br />\ntruly live up to the Banshees'<br />\n\"gothic rock\" appelation. Unlike<br />\nthose on previous albums, these<br />\nsongs don't really have individual<br />\nthemes as such. It's as if Sioux<br />\nand Severin decided to write<br />\nsongs in the form of three minute<br />\nhorror,stories\u2014The Banshees'<br />\npresent Tales from the Crypt.<br />\nMusically, the album is fairly<br />\nrepresentative of the Banshees'<br />\nsound though there are a few<br />\nnotable deviations. The first cut,<br />\n\"Peek-A-Boo,\" for example, indicates they've been listening to<br />\na bit of \"urban contemporary\"<br />\nradio. Its tape edited drum patterns, rubbery synth-bass line,<br />\nand chugging horns and accordian assimilate some of the<br />\naspects of hip-hop while remaining entirely within the Banshee<br />\ncanon. Ms. Sioux's vocal alternates between the sing-song of the<br />\nsong's tag line and a shrill<br />\ndescription of some demented<br />\ncarnival freak show. \"Burn Up\"<br />\nanother of Ms. Sioux's composi-<br /><br />\nFbRTSCAL<br />\nweek<br />\nWeekend<br />\nThis<br />\nWonderflix is running Baltimore<br />\nfave, Hairspray, director John<br />\nWaters' attempt at producing a<br />\n\"normal\" movie.

The<br />\nsong is, in every way, exactly the<br />\nkind of music Jones is singing<br />\nabout. \"You don't need to be<br />\nprofound/in fact don't speak/just<br />\nplay that sound.\" Jones is making a great point, especially for<br />\nthose people who've become<br />\nalmost anesthesized by unremittingly intellectualized music.<br />\nIn other songs this new approach doesn't work quite as<br />\nwell. At times, it seems Jones is<br />\nmistaking simple for simplistic.<br />\nTake for example, \"Hip, Neck,<br />\n&amp; Thigh.\" It has a simple<br />\nmelody, a happy beat, and lyrics<br />\nconsisting of \"I rock, you<br />\nroll/Baby, I don't care/you rock,<br />\nI roll/stay and make a pair.\" Admittedly, it's no dumber than<br />\nyour average disco bubblegum<br />\nbut coming from someone who<br />\nwrote \"Hitsville U.K.\" it sounds<br />\nmore lazy than inspired. \"2000<br />\nShoes\" is another good example.<br />\nIt's an amusing but terribly outof-date number based on the life<br />\nand sales receipts of shoe-fetishist<br />\nImelda Marcos. It makes a stab<br />\nat political relevance but doesn't<br />\nbother to back it up with anything<br />\nmore than a passing thought.<br /><br />\nIn stripping the music down to<br />\nits bare bones and reducing the<br />\nlyrics to simple catchy phrases,<br />\none places a premium on true inspiration. Even a good mix can't<br />\nalways save a song, and it doesn't<br />\nsound as though Jones, who also<br />\nproduced the record, took the<br />\ntime to try. Still, Tighten Up does<br />\nhave its moments.<br />\n\"Applecart\" is a song about<br />\nthe plight of a working class married couple who suddenly realize<br />\nthey never took the time to get Ic.<br />\nknow each other. It's a beautiful<br />\npiece of pop craft with its synthesized string section and bittersweet refrain, \"Don't rock the<br />\nboat/upset the applecart.\" Other<br />\nhighlights include \"Rock Non<br />\nStop (All Night Long),\" \"The<br />\nBattle of All Saints Road\"(about<br />\nthe day the rockers and the rastas<br />\ngot together and played), and the<br />\ntitle track.<br />\nIn spite of its difficulties,<br />\nthere's a lot to listen to here.<br />\nEven when he's not trying to say<br />\nmuch of anything at all, Mick<br />\nJones has more to say than most.<br />\nAnd when he says as little as well<br />\nas he does on \"Just Play Music,\"<br />\nit's almost worth the price of admission itself.<br /><br />\n14/OCTOBER 14, 1988<br /><br />\nScience<br />\nThe high cost of Hopkins laboratory research<br />\nCopyright 1988, The Chronicle can be staggering.

Now imagine this occurrence<br />\nfrom the spider's perspective.<br />\nRobert Fulghum does exactly<br />\nthis, and it's outrageously funny.<br />\nFulghum's new book is entitled,<br />\nAll I Really Need To Know 1<br />\nLearned in Kindergarten: Uncommon Thoughts on Common<br />\nThings.<br />\nRobert Fulghum's book is a<br />\ncollection of independent amusing anecdotes, most of which<br />\ncould only come from a person<br />\nwhose life has been as varied and<br />\nunique as his has.

He now lives<br />\non a houseboat in Seattle. Mr.<br /><br />\nFulghum is a teacher at The<br />\nLakeside Sch(x)I in Seattle, where<br />\nhe has taught drawing and painting for over twenty years.<br />\nThe genesis of Fulghum's book<br />\nwas an essay of the same title<br />\nwhich he delivered as a commencement address to a primary<br />\nschool class in Seattle. It is a few<br />\nsimple statements that make a<br />\ngood deal of sense. The essay<br />\ndeserves repeating here.<br /><br />\nAll I Really Need to Know<br />\nabout how to live and what to<br />\ndo and how to be I learned in<br />\nKindergarten.

Or, if all<br />\ngovernments had as a basic policy<br />\nto always put things back where<br />\nthey found them and to clean up<br />\ntheir own mess?<br />\nPerhaps the most attractive<br />\nquality of this book is that it is<br />\nsimple.

Knopf<br /><br />\nby Pamela A. Marthinuss<br />\nA visit to an abortionist opens<br />\nthe story in \"False Starts,\" a<br />\nnovel by Terri McFerrin Smith.<br />\nThe novel's central character<br />\nMara is a young woman to whom<br />\nwe become introduced through a<br />\nvariety of short scenes that attempt to acquaint the reader with<br />\nbits of her past and to come to<br />\nsome understanding as to her present life. However, there is no<br />\nvisible chronlogical order as the<br />\nnovel darts back and forth in<br />\ntime, which leaves the reader in<br />\nconfusion.<br />\nA menagerie of characters<br />\nwhich visit each glimpse of<br />\nMara's life are thoughtlessly<br />\npresented. There seems to be no<br />\nmethod to the madness in which<br />\nMcFerrin Smith introduces the<br />\ncharacters. We are not told who<br />\nthese people are until the reader<br /><br />\nhas struggled through countless<br />\nvisits. People that reappear later<br />\nhave no connection to their earlier<br />\nappearances. Mara's father is an<br />\nalcoholic and her mother is addicted to food, but when we are<br />\nreintroduced to them, these<br />\ncharacteristics disappear. There is<br />\nno consistency in the characters.<br />\nTowards the end the characters<br />\ncome into sharper focus, but why<br />\nshould any reader have to wade<br />\nthrough one hundred or so pages<br />\nto understand a character that<br />\nwasn't very interesting to begin<br />\nwith?<br />\nMara, as the central character<br />\nis weak, one dimensional, and<br />\ndevoid of personality. Only once<br />\ndoes she stick up for her rights<br />\n(when she's discussing a<br />\nwoman's rights), but other than<br />\nthat Mara is a character who is<br />\nalong for the journey. Mara<br />\nallows the other characters to rule<br />\nthe pages. There are no motivations behind her actions, at least<br />\nto the reader, because McFerrin<br />\nSmith hasn't presented a clear<br />\nview into Mara's past or her present worlds. Mara doesn't react<br />\nto situations with any sort of fire<br />\nor personality\u2014there is nothing<br />\nshe really cares about except her<br />\ndaughter, who is born and raised<br />\nentirely in the last scenes of this<br /><br />\nnovel. Mara doesn't even care<br />\nabout herself. \"She was not accustomed to being listened to\" by<br />\nothers in the book, nor by the<br />\nreader. Probably the best advice<br />\nused by the author is a letter from<br />\nMara to her mother; finally, the<br />\nreader can grasp some sort of personality within Mara, but it<br />\ndoesn't last.<br />\nHowever, descriptions within<br /><br />\nsonal thoughts, but other opinions<br />\nseem to stray out of the air such<br />\nas a commentary on the scenery.<br />\nIs it McFerrin Smith? If so, why<br />\ndoes she enter at will, destroying<br />\nthe fragile coherency of this<br />\nnovel?<br />\nEvents occur that seem to have<br />\nno purpose. Why does Mara<br />\nleave Mac? Does he leave her?<br />\nAnd why does he come back?<br /><br />\n\"Thefingers in her left hand spread<br />\nas she sucked and gripped the<br />\ncylinder again.\"\u2014from the novel.<br />\neach individual scene are vivid,<br />\nforcing the reader to focus, but<br />\nwith each new character we are<br />\nmerely along for an extremely<br />\nbumpy trip with people we don't<br />\nknow. McFerrin Smith masterfully describes the scenic beauty<br />\nof Montana and Missouri, but<br />\nwhat is the purpose of beautiful<br />\nscenery when the characters don't<br />\nmake sense?<br />\nThere is no coherency to the<br />\nnarration in \"False Starts.\" Is it<br />\nMara? Is it the author? Both are<br />\na possibility, but the author cannot decide. We get Mara's per,<br />\n. k,<br /><br />\nWho are these characters?<br />\nMcFerrin Smith has a difficult<br />\ntime answering the basic questions that abound in this novel.<br />\nEither she ignores them by a<br />\nchronological jump or she glosses<br />\nover the events and goes on. Very<br />\ndisappointing.<br />\nThe author seems unable to use<br />\nsymbolism; either it is overused<br />\nor misrepresented. In one scene<br />\nMara throws away a plastic ring<br />\nthat her boyfriend has given her,<br />\nsupposedly telling the reader that<br />\nMara wants nothing more to do<br />\nwith him, but in the next scene<br />\nt_t \u00ea t k.s.. .4 1.i<br /><br />\nAi..4.it I 44<br /><br />\nMara is moving in with Mac.<br />\nWhy? Why does she leave him in<br />\nthe first place? Why does she get<br />\ntogether with him?<br />\nWith the end of the novel in<br />\nsight, there is finally some<br />\ncoherency as Mara attempts to<br />\nwork through problems of<br />\npregnancy, solitude, and unfaithfulness. When Mara decided<br />\nto raise the child instead of having another abortion, we see<br />\nsome semblance of maturity of a<br />\ncharacter whose age is never<br />\nmentioned. Then, the novelfinally achieves chronological order,<br />\nand that is reassuring to the<br />\nreader. The ending is unfulfilling<br />\nand suggests the author is unsure<br />\nnot only of her craft, but also of<br />\nhow to answer numerous problems that arise in this novel. The<br />\nreader is left with only a vague<br />\nidea of what has been accomplished by this novel, if<br />\nanything.<br />\nThe novel is a valiant attempt<br />\nby a first time author, but revisions with an eye towards a focused, coherent final product would<br />\nbenefit this novel immensely. The<br />\nmore I read, the more I was convinced that the novel would have<br />\nmade a great collection of short<br />\nstories.

They have<br />\nplayed brilliantly, holding their<br />\nopponents to an average of only<br />\n17 points per game while the<br />\nwishbone has managed only 18<br />\npoints in the first four games.<br />\nLast Saturday, the offense finally exploded for 28 points, but this<br />\ntime it was the defense that<br />\nfaltered as Ursinus used a balanced attack to upend Hopkins<br />\n34-28.<br />\nThe two teams traded touchdowns in the first half, with Brian<br />\nDulin running it in from 26 yards<br />\nout for Hopkins. The Bears,<br />\nhowever, took command in the<br />\nthird quarter with two<br />\ntouchdowns as they stretched<br />\ntheir lead to 19-7. It was in the<br />\nfourth quarter that the \"new<br />\nlook\" Blue Jay offense finally<br />\nbegan to click.<br />\nHopkins had been running the<br />\nwishbone all season, but were<br />\nunable to effectively use the<br />\nhalfback option. On Saturday, the<br />\nJays went back to the multiple set<br />\noffense they have used in past<br />\nseasons and had immediate success. Ironically, it was the option<br />\npasses and sweeps, the very plays<br />\nthat make the wishbone so deadly, that provided the big plays for<br />\nHopkins.<br />\nIn the fourth quarter, Gary<br />\nRupert led the Blue Jays on a<br />\npassing assault, combining most<br /><br />\noften with junior wide receiver<br />\nBrandon Rosser. Rosser, who<br />\ncaught six passes two weeks ago<br />\nagainst Gettysburg, had seven<br />\ncatches for 113 yards. Rupert<br />\ncapped off two beautiful Hopkins<br />\ndrives with TD runs to put the<br />\nJays in front 20-19. The Bears'<br />\nLou Haenel, however, returned<br />\nthe ensuing kickoff 80 yards for<br />\na touchdown, and after a two<br />\npoint conversion, Ursinus regained the lead 27-20.<br />\nThe rejuvenated Hopkins offense came right back on the next<br />\ndrive for yet another touchdown.<br />\nAfter freshman Eric Williams ran<br />\nthe ball in from 10 yards out,<br />\nRupert connected with Rosser for<br />\na two point conversion to give<br />\nHopkins a 28-27 lead with only<br />\n2:10 to play.<br />\nThe Blue Jay defense was<br />\nunable to hold, however, as Ursinus scored on a ten yard pass<br />\nfrom quarterback Brian Thomas<br />\nto Kevin Ross with only 33<br />\nseconds to play to take a 34-28<br />\nlead. Thomas was brilliant all<br />\nafternoon, as he burned the<br />\nHopkins secondary by completing<br />\n19 of 30 passes for 209 yards and<br />\nthree touchdowns. The Bears used a balanced attack all afternoon,<br />\nracking up 192 yards on the<br />\nground and 401 yards of total<br />\noffense.<br />\nSo yet again the Blue Jays were<br />\nunable to play well on both sides<br />\nof the ball as they fell to 0-5.<br />\nDespite their record, most of the<br />\nteam is keeping a fairly positive<br /><br />\noutlook on the rest of the season.<br />\n\"We're 0-5, but we don't<br />\nrealize it,\" said Rosser. \"We're<br />\na gocd team, and we have the<br />\ntaleneand potential to win. Last<br />\nweek was a turning point and a<br />\nconfidence builder for the offense. We just have to take it a<br />\nweek at a time.\"<br />\nThis week, the Blue Jays will<br />\nplay host to the Muhlenberg<br />\nMules. Last year, when the Mules<br />\nwent 7-3 and fielded eight allconference players, Hopkins<br />\nupset Muhlenberg 29-13 and<br />\nruined their homecoming.<br />\nQuarterback Chris Elser, an allCentennial selection last year,<br />\nreturned at QB and should provide<br />\na tough test for the Jays' defense.<br />\nSenior linebacker John Murphy<br />\nled a defense which surrendered 399 yards passing and<br />\n470 total yards to the Blue Jays<br />\nlast season. This Saturday's game<br />\nmarks the beginning of an extremely difficult four game<br />\nstretch for Hopkins, during which<br />\nthey will face such opponents as<br />\nDickinson, Georgetown, and<br />\nFranklin &amp; Marshall. With only<br />\nfive games remaining, hopes of a<br />\n.500 record are extremely dim.<br />\n\"Our goal is to go 5-0,\" said<br />\nCoach Jerry Pfeifer. \"We know<br />\nthat's going to be tough to do, but<br />\nwe feel we can hit with anyone.\"<br />\nNotes: According to Pfeifer,<br />\nthe wishbone will resurface<br />\nperiodically throughout the rest of<br />\nthe season, but it will no longer<br />\nbe the main offense for the Jays.<br /><br />\nMuhlenberg is currently 3-2 with<br />\na 2-2 conference record, and they<br />\nare riding a two game winning<br />\nstreak.

Juniata is not expected<br />\nto beat Gettysburg, since Gettysburg beat Hopkins 3-1 and<br />\nHopkins beat Juniata 3-0, but the<br />\ngame is at Juniata and the home<br />\nteam has the talent to possibly<br />\npull out a close win. If Gettysburg<br />\nbeats or ties Juniata, then they<br />\nfinish number one in the MAC<br />\nSouthwest section and Hopkins<br />\nfinishes second. If Hopkins<br />\nmakes the playoffs, they will play<br />\neither Lebanon Valley or Messiah<br />\nin the first round.<br />\nOn Tuesday's game at<br />\nWashington College, the home<br />\nteam must have been very<br />\nfrustrated. Hopkins had only<br />\nthree shots on goal, scoring on<br />\ntwo of them, while Washington<br />\nhad twenty-three and scored on<br />\nnone. Jackie Fatula scored on a<br />\npass from Meredith Blitz less than<br />\nthree minutes into the game, but<br /><br />\nafter that the offense fell apart.<br />\n\"We weren't very sharp, we<br />\ncouldn't get an attack going the<br />\nwhole first half,\" said Coach<br />\nAnderson. The Jays were still<br />\nable to score again, as Patti Ordonez pushed a ball off the<br />\ngoalie's pads into the goal, a play<br />\nset up by Blitz. \"Our players find<br />\na way to win,\" Anderson stated.<br />\nThe key to the victory was<br />\ngoalie Jennifer O'Hara, who had<br />\nfifteen saves in her fourth shutout<br />\nof the season. According to<br />\nCoach Anderson, \"She had a<br />\ngreat game.

Four racers, junior Udai<br />\nKammula, senior Kyu-Tae Lee,<br />\nand sophomores Chad Mynhier<br />\nand Chuck Young, gave their best<br />\non the dark and cloudy Labor<br />\nDay. The event opened with a<br />\n10K individual time trial (Ti'),<br />\nbetter known as the \"race of<br />\ntruth\" since this kind of race pits<br />\na solo rider against time.<br />\nHowever, a poorly marked turnaround point sent nearly half of<br />\nthe riders on an unexpected tour<br />\nof Harford county and made the<br />\n10K stage more like a 10 mile<br />\nstage. \"It was really disastrous,\"<br />\nrecounted Mynhier, \"but almost<br />\neveryone else missed the turnaround too, so there wasn't<br />\nmuch we oculd do except try to<br />\nrally back during the next two<br />\nstages.\" And rally back they did<br />\nduring stage two, a 22 mile road<br />\nrace that wound its way through<br />\nthe beautiful countryside of northern Maryland. However, none<br />\nof the racers had time to take in<br />\nthe scenery because near the<br /><br />\nseven mile mark a crash took<br />\ndown three riders, including<br />\nChuck Young. Ironically, it was<br />\nthis crash that launched Lee and<br />\nMynhier off the front. By the time<br />\nthe duo reached the line, the<br />\nnearest rider was still two minutes<br />\nback, and the rest of the pack, being controlled by Udai Kammula,<br />\nwas four minutes down. The final<br />\nstage was a 10 mile criterium<br />\naround a short half mile closed<br />\nloop course. Right off the start<br />\nLee and Young rolled off the<br />\nfront of the pack while Kammula<br />\nand Mynhier stayed back to slow<br />\ndown the rest of the field. Both<br />\nmanaged to lap the field for the<br />\nsecond Hopkins 1-2 finish of the<br />\nday, and Mynhier and Kammula<br />\nbrought it all home with a 3-4<br />\nfinish in the field sprint, making<br />\nit an all Hopkins sweep. The<br />\noverall standings for general<br />\nclassification(GC)saw Lee first,<br />\nMynhier second, Kammula<br />\nfourth, and Young eighth.<br />\nThe next race saw the biggest<br />\nHopkins turnout yet as ten<br />\nFighting Jays came out to duke it<br />\nout in the pack. The Eastern<br />\nShore Velo Club sponsored its<br />\nannual two day, three stage event<br />\nsee CYCLING, 23<br /><br />\nThe women's cross country<br />\ndisplayed its greatest team effort<br />\nof the season, as they won the<br />\nDickinson Invitational last Saturday. The Blue Jays finished first<br />\nout of nine teams, of which seven<br />\nwere MAC competitors. Hopkins<br />\nplaced five runners in the top<br />\ntwenty and emerged as one of the<br />\nfavorites in next month's MAC<br />\nChampionships.<br />\nMolly Bardsley led the Lady<br />\nJays with a time of 18:57, which<br />\nsecured her a second place medal<br />\nin the race. Anna Lee Bamforth<br />\nwas the next Hopkins runner to<br />\ncross the finish line in an impressive time of 19:45. Suzi<br />\nMcGinn turned in a gutsy performance, as she posted a time of<br />\n19:54, despite being quite ill.<br />\nDiana Logan became the fourth<br />\nHopkins runner to break the<br />\ntwenty minute barrier, as she ran<br />\nat 19:59 and improved on her<br />\ntime from last year by seven<br />\nminutes.

Hopkins<br />\ntook three of the top five spots as<br />\nBrian Brewer came flying in with<br />\na time of 20:32 to take first. Laing came in third, and Lee was<br />\nfifth.<br />\nHalf an hour later the field was<br />\nrolling along the road again, this<br />\ntime on an 18 mile road race. The<br />\nmain battle for control of the pack<br />\ntook place between Hopkins and<br />\nNavy, who also fielded a strong<br />\nteam. The race was marred with<br />\na crash that sent one rider to the<br />\nhospital. Luckily, no serious injuries occurred and all the Jays<br />\nmade it through unscathed. As the<br />\nfinal sprint came rolling arouild,<br /><br />\nLaing and Brewer picked up the<br />\npace in an effort to string out the<br />\npack so that some of the team's<br />\nsprinters would have a clearer<br />\nshot at winning. The teamwork<br />\npaid off as Lee came in for the<br />\nstage win, and Brewer still<br />\nmanaged to place fifth. At the end<br />\nof the day Lee was tied with<br />\nanother rider for first place in GC<br />\nand Laing was tied in second<br />\nplace with a rider from Navy.<br />\nThe next day brought on a<br />\nflurry of action in the final stage,<br />\na 36 mile road race. Four laps<br />\naround a 9 mile circuit brought<br />\nabout plenty of sprints as<br />\n\"primes\"<br />\n(pronounced<br />\n\"preems\"), usually time<br />\nbonuses, points, or prizes, were<br />\ngiven out to the first rider across<br />\nthe line on all but the first lap.<br />\nConsequently all the riders were<br />\nkeying in on winning the sprints.<br />\nNavy tried to send off a rider on<br />\na break to win the first prime, but<br />\nthe pack, led by Hopkins, reeled<br />\nhim in before he could get away.<br />\nThen with 400 meters to go,<br />\nBrewer let loose and came across<br />\nto take the first prime fo the day.<br />\nThe next time around Brewer<br />\nagain took off with another Jay,<br />\nChuck Young, but this time with<br />\nmore than a half mile to go.<br />\nSeveral Hopkins riders tried to<br />\nblock and slow down the peloton,<br />\nbut a strong chase by Navy reeled Brewer back in. Although<br />\nmost other riders would have<br />\ngiven up after being swallowed<br />\nup again, Brewer counter-attacked<br />\nand flew across the line to take<br />\nthe second prime, also. Then as<br />\nthe pack rolled around for the last<br />\nlap, the pace slowed as everyone<br /><br />\ntried to rest up for the final sprint<br />\nof the day, the one to win the<br />\nrace.<br />\nCome the final sprint Navy<br />\nended up taking the stage while<br />\nLee came in for second and<br />\nBrewer took fourth. Said Lee of<br />\nthe final spring,' It was a really<br />\nscary sprint. We were all lined up<br />\nacross the road so it was hard just<br />\ntrying to sprint around the slower<br />\nriders. On top of that the Navy<br />\nriders kept bumping me to try to<br />\nslow me down. In the final sprint<br />\none of them actually forced me<br />\ninto another rider.\"<br />\nAfter all was said and done,<br />\nHopkins still came out on top<br />\nwith Lee winning overall and<br />\nBrewer taking fifth. Navy took<br />\nsecond and fourth. \"I guess if<br />\nyou average things out, both<br />\nteams made out even, but we took<br />\nall of the prime sprints, too, so<br />\nI think we proved ourselves as a<br />\nstronger team,\" said Gurland.<br />\n\"Also the strength of our entire<br />\nteam was suprising, especially the<br />\nnewcomers to the team like Edwin (Dair) and Jon (Budelman).<br />\nAt the end of the race they were<br />\nall up there with the lead group<br />\nand hanging tough with the more<br />\nseasoned riders,\" aded Mynhier.<br />\nAll told the Hopkins Cycling<br />\nTeam brought home five overall<br />\nwins and four stage victories this<br />\nseason so far. But wait! There's<br />\nstill more action to come. Two<br />\nmore races are slated for the<br />\nseason before it comes to an end,<br />\nand at least one fun Fall Tour is<br />\nin the works so anyone interested<br />\nin riding and/or racing should<br />\ncontact either Lance or Kyu at<br />\n467-3203.<br /><br />\nWHAT IF YOU<br />\nDON'T GET<br />\nINTO THE GRAD<br />\nSCHOOL OF<br />\nYOUR CHOICE?<br /><br />\n1KAPLAN<br /><br />\nSTANLEY H.
