LICKSON<br />\nPres. Blue Key Club<br />\nWe who have the good fortune<br />\nto be attending this noble University are aware of the fact<br />\nthat it is among the finest in<br />\nthe world. The graduate departments are probably the most<br />\nfamous. I refer, especially, to<br />\nthe Medical School, the other<br />\nscientific departments, and those<br />\nliberal arts departments whose<br />\nprofessors command the respect<br />\nnecessary to appeal to the top<br />\ngraduates of the world's undergraduate schools.<br />\nThe catalogue of this University boa.sts of many schools, located in this country and abroad.<br />\nBut, to the keen academic eye,<br />\nthere Is one large gap. Johns<br />\nHopkins has no Law School. That<br />\nis not to say law is not studied,<br />\nhere. The ironic thing is that<br />\nwe are fortunate enough to have<br />\non our staff one of the outstand-<br />\n<br />\ning experts on American Constitutional Law and Jurisprudence. We also have very competant young professors whose<br />\nfields are International Law and<br />\nComparative<br />\nLaw.<br />\nHopkins'<br />\nLibrary has a very large collection of books in field of law<br />\nincluding the reports from most<br />\nstates, the entire federal system,<br />\nand many key foreign reports.<br />\nHopkins has begun new departments with far less to work<br />\nwith than this. Ls this not a<br />\nsubstantial nucleus from which<br />\na separate law school could possibly radiate? To those who<br />\nwould ask the question as to<br />\nfunds, a reference ought to be<br />\nmade to the huge number of<br />\nlawyers who are alumni of Hopkins. Many of Baltimore's largest<br />\nlaw firms are inhabited by Hopkins men. If they were approached, as well as the various<br />\nlocal bar associations, the ed-<br />\n<br />\nucational\u2022<br />\nfoundations,<br />\nand<br />\nAlumni and friends of the University, a large sum could be<br />\nraised. Reinforced by the tuition<br />\nto be charged law students, the<br />\nfinances could be arranged.<br />\nThere are many lovely old buildings and houses that would serve<br />\nas ample location for a Law<br />\n<br />\nOne important problem that<br />\nfaces the fraternity system at<br />\nHopkins is the question of fraternity housing. Many of the<br />\nfraternity houses are neither<br />\nadequate nor comfortable enough<br />\nto accommodate the large number of brothers who desire to live<br />\nin the house. Many fraternity<br />\nmen must resort to renting<br />\napartments in the vicinity of the<br />\ncampus or living in the dormitory. As a result, there is a lack<br />\nof unity and strength within the<br />\nfraternity itself, resulting in a<br />\nloosely knit organization. Accommodation for all the brothers<br />\nin the fraternity house would<br />\ncreate a tighter inner cohesion<br />\nwithin the fraternity, promote<br />\ngreater spirit and perhaps reduce<br />\nmuch of the apathy that has<br />\noverspread our campus in recent<br />\nyears.<br />\nIdeal Situation<br />\nThe ideal situation would be<br />\nfor the administration to build<br />\na fraternity row on campus involving a long-term lease with<br />\neach fraternity. The fraternity<br />\nhouses could be constructed to<br />\nmeet the individual needs of the<br />\nfourteen fraternities here at<br />\nHopkins. The administration has<br />\ndiscussed the possibility of building a,dormitory-type fraternity<br />\ndwelling, with two or three separate dining halls, but this is<br />\ntotally unacceptable as it defeats<br />\nthe principal of uniqueness in a<br />\nfraternity and would result in<br />\none huge dormitory club. Since<br />\nI do not foresee any compromise<br />\nresulting between the fraternities<br />\nand the administration in ,the<br />\nnear future, the next alternative<br />\n<br />\nis to look toward Canterbury<br />\nRoad.<br />\nAs a result of the diligent efforts of one of our fraternities,<br />\nthere is a possible opportunity<br />\nthat adequate and comfortable<br />\nhouses will be available in the<br />\nvicinity of Canterbury Road.<br />\nThis move would further accommodate the needs of the fraternity men at Hopkins and<br />\nwould create a more spirited and<br />\nbinding fraternity system.<br />\nIntellectual Block<br />\nThe second problem that the<br />\nfraternities face at the Homewood is a serious intellectual<br />\nblock. The trend at Hopkins in<br />\nthe past four years is to attract<br />\nthe student who excels only in<br />\nachievement. This<br />\nscholastic<br />\ntrend is definitely a good attainment on the part of the administration, but while devoting<br />\nmuch attention to high school<br />\nscholastic achievement and seven<br />\nhundred College Board scores, we<br />\nshould not overlook the versatile<br />\nwell-rounded individual. Let us<br />\nnot sacrifice quality of character<br />\nand achievement in all aspects<br />\nof the student for the complete<br />\nintellectual prig. It would be to<br />\nthe advantage of \u2022 our fraternity<br />\nsystem, the entire student body<br />\nand the name Johns Hopkins to<br />\naccept the well-rounded individual rather than the pseudo ivyleague reject.<br />\n<br />\nFRANK DOUGHERTY<br />\n<br />\n-New Dance Step-<br />\n<br />\nSchool.

LICKSON<br />\nPres. Blue Key Club<br />\nWe who have the good fortune<br />\nto be attending this noble University are aware of the fact<br />\nthat it is among the finest in<br />\nthe world. The graduate departments are probably the most<br />\nfamous. I refer, especially, to<br />\nthe Medical School, the other<br />\nscientific departments, and those<br />\nliberal arts departments whose<br />\nprofessors command the respect<br />\nnecessary to appeal to the top<br />\ngraduates of the world's undergraduate schools.<br />\nThe catalogue of this University boa.sts of many schools, located in this country and abroad.<br />\nBut, to the keen academic eye,<br />\nthere Is one large gap. Johns<br />\nHopkins has no Law School. That<br />\nis not to say law is not studied,<br />\nhere. The ironic thing is that<br />\nwe are fortunate enough to have<br />\non our staff one of the outstand-<br /><br />\ning experts on American Constitutional Law and Jurisprudence. We also have very competant young professors whose<br />\nfields are International Law and<br />\nComparative<br />\nLaw.<br />\nHopkins'<br />\nLibrary has a very large collection of books in field of law<br />\nincluding the reports from most<br />\nstates, the entire federal system,<br />\nand many key foreign reports.<br />\nHopkins has begun new departments with far less to work<br />\nwith than this. Ls this not a<br />\nsubstantial nucleus from which<br />\na separate law school could possibly radiate? To those who<br />\nwould ask the question as to<br />\nfunds, a reference ought to be<br />\nmade to the huge number of<br />\nlawyers who are alumni of Hopkins. Many of Baltimore's largest<br />\nlaw firms are inhabited by Hopkins men. If they were approached, as well as the various<br />\nlocal bar associations, the ed-<br /><br />\nucational\u2022<br />\nfoundations,<br />\nand<br />\nAlumni and friends of the University, a large sum could be<br />\nraised.

Many of the<br />\nfraternity houses are neither<br />\nadequate nor comfortable enough<br />\nto accommodate the large number of brothers who desire to live<br />\nin the house. Many fraternity<br />\nmen must resort to renting<br />\napartments in the vicinity of the<br />\ncampus or living in the dormitory. As a result, there is a lack<br />\nof unity and strength within the<br />\nfraternity itself, resulting in a<br />\nloosely knit organization. Accommodation for all the brothers<br />\nin the fraternity house would<br />\ncreate a tighter inner cohesion<br />\nwithin the fraternity, promote<br />\ngreater spirit and perhaps reduce<br />\nmuch of the apathy that has<br />\noverspread our campus in recent<br />\nyears.<br />\nIdeal Situation<br />\nThe ideal situation would be<br />\nfor the administration to build<br />\na fraternity row on campus involving a long-term lease with<br />\neach fraternity. The fraternity<br />\nhouses could be constructed to<br />\nmeet the individual needs of the<br />\nfourteen fraternities here at<br />\nHopkins. The administration has<br />\ndiscussed the possibility of building a,dormitory-type fraternity<br />\ndwelling, with two or three separate dining halls, but this is<br />\ntotally unacceptable as it defeats<br />\nthe principal of uniqueness in a<br />\nfraternity and would result in<br />\none huge dormitory club. Since<br />\nI do not foresee any compromise<br />\nresulting between the fraternities<br />\nand the administration in ,the<br />\nnear future, the next alternative<br /><br />\nis to look toward Canterbury<br />\nRoad.<br />\nAs a result of the diligent efforts of one of our fraternities,<br />\nthere is a possible opportunity<br />\nthat adequate and comfortable<br />\nhouses will be available in the<br />\nvicinity of Canterbury Road.<br />\nThis move would further accommodate the needs of the fraternity men at Hopkins and<br />\nwould create a more spirited and<br />\nbinding fraternity system.<br />\nIntellectual Block<br />\nThe second problem that the<br />\nfraternities face at the Homewood is a serious intellectual<br />\nblock. The trend at Hopkins in<br />\nthe past four years is to attract<br />\nthe student who excels only in<br />\nachievement. This<br />\nscholastic<br />\ntrend is definitely a good attainment on the part of the administration, but while devoting<br />\nmuch attention to high school<br />\nscholastic achievement and seven<br />\nhundred College Board scores, we<br />\nshould not overlook the versatile<br />\nwell-rounded individual. Let us<br />\nnot sacrifice quality of character<br />\nand achievement in all aspects<br />\nof the student for the complete<br />\nintellectual prig.
