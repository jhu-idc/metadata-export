The first of these facts might be<br />\ncalled the building up of the modern worldEvery decade destroys more and<br />\nmarket.<br />\nmore completely that local economic isolation<br />\nwhich was the rule before the introduction of<br />\nsteam power in manufactures and transportation. The growing relative importance of foreign trade as a factor in national prosperity is<br />\nmore and more apparent. It is rapidly coming<br />\nto be the dominant factor. National isolation<br />\nin economic matters is becoming ever more<br />\nimpossible. The German Government by its<br />\nrules for meat inspection can dictate how our<br />\nbeef and pork shall be produced and prepared. We cannot lay a new import duty<br />\nwithout a storm of angry protests from foreign<br />\ncountries. The price of our wheat and our<br />\nsilver is fixed in London. There tends more<br />\nand more to be a world rate of interest on loans<br />\nof capital.<br />\nOur earlier policy of national isolation in<br />\npolitical affairs rested upon the fact of economic isolation due to the existence of no better motive power than wind for ocean transportation. There can be little doubt that were<br />\nWashington alive today he would express decided views in favor of our national expansion. Privately and officially he was always<br />\nin favor of expansion. He planned to secure<br />\ncanals and roads into the country across the<br />\nAlleghenies in order to prevent the population there from going over to Louisiana. He<br />\nforesaw much of the expansion of the country<br />\nand favored governmental action to secure<br />\nthat expansion. And he saw that the extent<br />\nof expansion depended primarily upon the conManila today is<br />\ndition of transportation.<br />\nnearer to the United States than was the Mis-<br />\n<br />\nNo. 9<br />\n<br />\nsissippi in Washington's time to the thirteen<br />\noriginal State's. Mere separation by sea is no<br />\nlonger a real obstacle to national expansion.<br />\nIf the question of military defense be raised, a<br />\nglance at our history shows that we have<br />\nalways been more conspicuously capable in seafighting than in land-fighting.<br />\nThe second economic fact in favor of expansion is the recent rapid growth in our exports<br />\nof manufactures. Since 1888 our yearly exports of iron and steel have increased fourfold<br />\nin value, copper and its manufactured products<br />\nninefold, agricultural implements threefold,<br />\npaper over fivefold. Our total exports of manufactures were, in 1888, $13o,000,000 ; in<br />\n1898, $29o,000,000. This is not a mere temporary spurt, but rests on deep and permanent<br />\nmovements. We have completed the extensive occupation of our territory and have developed our manufacturing power beyond the<br />\nAnyone who<br />\nneeds of our home market.<br />\nknows our national characteristics in business<br />\nknows that henceforth, whatever policy the<br />\ngovernment may adopt for the time, our manufactures as well as our agricultural products<br />\nwill seize wider and wider markets in the<br />\nworld. We are entering the general struggle<br />\nfor supremacy in the world's commercial and<br />\nfinancial market to win. It lies within the<br />\nchoice of our Government to accept or to<br />\nthrow away a magnificent position of advantage in this struggle. It is not the trade of the<br />\nPhilippines which is at stake. That is a mere<br />\nbagatelle. The demand of China and other<br />\nEastern countries for modern manufactures<br />\nwill grow soon to enormous proportions. By<br />\ngeographical position we naturally ought to<br />\nhave the lion's share in that development.<br />\nPlanting ourselves firmly in the Southern Pacific as we have in the Northern, we shall be<br />\nable to check the efforts of European nations<br />\nto squeeze us out of this trade, We must con-<br />\n<br />\n\f2<br />\n<br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\n<br />\nvince Asia and Europe that we mean to hold<br />\nour own in this struggle. Commerce is not a<br />\nbenevolent understanding in which each party<br />\ntries to give away the utmost to his neighbor.<br />\nIt is an active struggle between rivals, and<br />\nmust be aggressive in every legitimate way.<br />\nWe ought to have a national spirit in this matter and an alert governmental policy to push<br />\nour commercial interests.<br />\nWould the holding of the Philippines be<br />\nunjust to their people ? Look at the facts.<br />\nWould their abandonment to the scramble of<br />\nthe European nations be any more just? They<br />\nare now incapable of self-government, and<br />\ncannot defend themselves against Europe. We<br />\nhave done the last act in rendering them helpless. We would be dishonorable in the last degree to abandon them now. Our duty and our<br />\ninterest in this case coincide.<br />\nIf there be a constitutional objection\", as Jefferson thought there was in the case of Louisiana, why not amend the Constitution ? Our<br />\nfathers, whom we so deeply malign by trying<br />\nto make them out to be the enemies of progress,<br />\nprovided a way by which the Constitution<br />\nmight be changed.<br />\nOne thing is certain : Our people, with the<br />\nsure instinct of their race, have seized the logic<br />\nof the situation. They have always expanded,<br />\nand they always will until the growth of national spirit is checked and decadence sets in.<br />\nSIDNEY SHERWOOD.<br />\n<br />\npulse and am confident that I can govern an<br />\nisland,' And so we say of ourselves. But are<br />\nyou sure of this ? We have no such need of<br />\ncolonizing as Great Britain, with her small<br />\ninsular area and surplus population. Our situation is rather like Russia in creeping over<br />\na continent, and making one vast area from<br />\nocean to ocean the sphere of our influence.<br />\nShould it appear that in order to gain a colonial trade worth $500,000 our corresponding<br />\nexpenditure would be $1,000,000, we should<br />\nnot be the gainers by such a trade, but losers,<br />\nand with this disadvantage\u2014that the burden<br />\nof expenditure would fall upon our whole people, while the gain would be mostly the monopoly of a favored few.<br />\n\"Then, as to the government of such colonies, if, as Great Britain treated us, our great<br />\neffort would be the greed of gain in a new<br />\nmarket, as spirited a race might in time win<br />\ntheir own independence of us and condemn our<br />\ncourse in history. But if, on the other hand,<br />\nwe hold the mastery over a subject race, then<br />\nretribution may await us as in 186r. At all<br />\nevents, what Burke said should be remembered\u2014that a nation should not seek to govern<br />\nanother people by their own methods without<br />\ndue deference to the tastes and habits of the<br />\npeople themselves.\"<br />\nos<br />\nTHE PUBLIC DEBATE.<br />\n<br />\nThe provisional debating teams of the Senate<br />\n.14<br />\nand House have been selected, and have already<br />\nANOTHER POINT OF VIEW.<br />\nbegun active training.

Any<br />\nman who fails to appear at the appointed<br />\ntimes will be summarily dropped, and his place<br />\nfilled by another member of his class. Dr.<br />\nLee has appointed nine men from each body<br />\non the so-called provisional teams. From these,<br />\nthree on each side will be retained to act as<br />\nadvisers to the actual speakers. Their names<br />\nwill be announced about the middle of February. Of the remaining candidates, three<br />\nwill be chosen as the speakers on each side, all<br />\nof whom will have an alternate. This last<br />\nselection will not be made until about the<br />\noth of March.<br />\nThe work of training for the debate will be<br />\nunder the general supervision of Dr. Lee.<br />\nEach team has had a chairman appointed from<br />\nits own members, who has direct charge of the<br />\nmen, and will report to Dr. Lee. John C.<br />\nFrench and W. P. Shriver hold these offices<br />\namong the Seniors and Juniors, respectively.<br />\nIn this way the contestants are thrown somewhat on their own resources, and are made to<br />\nfeel the necessity of hard, conscientious work<br />\nin preparation.<br />\nOn the same evening picked members of the<br />\nfreshman class will hold a contest in public<br />\nspeaking. Preliminary selections have already<br />\nbeen made from that class, and the speakers<br />\nwill soon be finally decided.<br />\nDr. Adams has generously offered, as he<br />\ndid last year, to provide a trophy to be contested for by the teams, and also individual<br />\nprizes for the various successful speakers. A<br />\nnumber of prominent lawyers of the city will<br />\nbe asked to serve as judges of the contests, and<br />\neverything points to a most successful evening.<br />\nDr. Lee has made the following appointments : Robert H. Grimes ('99), Chairman<br />\n-of general Committee of Arrangements. Chairmen of sub-committees : James L. A. Burrell (1900), Invitations; G. Canby Robinson<br />\n('99), Reception; J.

By the<br />\nwill of Johns, Hopkins, the most of his large<br />\nestate was bequeathed to a board of trustees,<br />\nwhom he had previously selected, to manage<br />\nthe University and Hospital that bear his name.<br />\nOf these trustees Galloway Cheston was president. The remaining members of the board<br />\nwere George W. Dobbin, George William<br />\nBrown, Francis King, Thomas M. Smith,<br />\nJames Carey Thomas, Charles J. M. Gwinn,<br />\nLewis N. Hopkins, Reverdy Johnson, Jr., and<br />\nFrancis White. Their first meeting after Mr.<br />\nHopkins' death was held February 6, 1874, so<br />\nthat just twenty-five years have passed since<br />\nthey undertook their responsibility.<br />\nOnly three of the members of the board are<br />\nnow living, namely : Francis White, treasurer ; Lewis N. Hopkins, secretary, and Reverdy Johnson, who was for several years chairman of the executive committee.<br />\nIn commemoration of this beginning of<br />\nthe work, the trustees have requested President<br />\nGilman to deliver a discourse on The History<br />\nand Prospects of the Johns Hopkins University. The exercises will be held in McCoy Hall<br />\nand as usual everyone belonging to the University is expected to be present. A number<br />\nof degrees will be conferred. It is expected<br />\nthat on that day recently painted portraits of<br />\nProfessor Sylvester and of Professor Remsen<br />\nwill be presented to the University.<br />\nThe Alumni Association of the University<br />\nwill hold its annual dinner on the evening of<br />\nCommemoration Day at the Rennert. Rev.<br />\nMaltbie D. Babcock, D. D., pastor of Brown<br />\nMemorial Church, will speak on The Proper<br />\nRelations of College Men to the Poor and the<br />\nAfflicted in a Large City. Professor Osler,<br />\nand Judge McSherry of the Court of Appeals<br />\nwill also make after-dinner speeches.

OTTLEY'S timely article in this issue on<br />\nLong-Distance Running suggests the vital importance of training to the athlete, whether<br />\nfor track or field. It is a dangerous, certainly a foolish, risk for a man whose general physical condition has been impaired,<br />\neither through self-indulgence or the sedentary<br />\nlife of the student, to submit himself to the<br />\nsevere strain on nerves, heart, and lungs involved in athletic competition. While the end<br />\nof athletics is not prizes, but the pleasure of<br />\ncompetition, and the physical benefit to be derived, a man out of condition misses all of<br />\nthese. He wins no prizes, reflects no credit on<br />\nthe colors he wears, and is more than likely to<br />\nsuffer physical harm. If Hopkins athletes are<br />\nnot well trained, it is their own fault. Every<br />\nreasonable facility is afforded them : the new<br />\ngymnasium, complete in its equipment of apparatus and baths ; a cage for indoor pracTHE NEWS-LETTER in this issue prints two tice, up to date in all its appointments ; rubtimely articles on Expansion\u2014one from the bers, and witch hazel ad libitum, and an outpen of Dr. Sherwood, associate professor of door director, who, from his long experience,<br />\neconomics ; the other, an interview with Pro- ought to be qualified to give every needed adfessor Schouler, now lecturing at the Univer- vice. Little more could be asked. It means<br />\nsity. Mr. Ottley, of the Medical School, who that apart from these outside agencies there<br />\nlast spring won the mile walk for Hopkins at must be, inside the man, a determination to live<br />\nthe Princeton games, furnishes the second in up to the spirit of the training pledge ; that he<br />\nthe series of Points on Athletics. In the next will conscientiously and without prodding folnumber Mr. F. J. Walz, local forecast official, low the advice of the trainer. Nothing short<br />\nstationed at the Hopkins Observatory, will tell of this is enough.<br />\n<br />\nCHANGES in the Board of Editors noted above<br />\nhave been occasioned by the resignation of<br />\nJohn C. French as editor-in-chief because of<br />\nexacting editorial work on The Hullabaloo.<br />\nMr. French has been identified with THE<br />\nNEWS-LETTER almost from its inception, and<br />\nin the line of editorial succession followed<br />\nEdgeworth Smith, the founder of the paper.<br />\nA conscientious editor and painstaking writer,<br />\nhe has contributed largely to make the paper<br />\nwhat it is\u2014without a long blast from our own<br />\nhorn\u2014a not unworthy representative of Johns<br />\nHopkins in the field of college journalism. The<br />\nstaff takes this way of making permanent an<br />\nexpression of their warm personal regard for<br />\nMr. French, and the pleasure they have had in<br />\nsharing with him the work of \"getting out the<br />\npaper.\"<br />\n<br />\n\fTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\nHopkins teams have suffered in other days<br />\nfrom a representation of poorly trained men.<br />\nFlagrant breaches of training rules witnessed<br />\non the baseball team last season color the mind<br />\nlike a bad dream. But there is reason now to<br />\nexpect better things. By a rule of the gymnasium committee of the faculty, further<br />\nadopted by the Board of the Athletic Association, the outdoor director is held responsible<br />\nfor the physical condition of the men in his<br />\ndepartment, candidates for, and members of<br />\nteams. The University will look to the outdoor director to strictly enforce the training<br />\nrules. A man who intentionally violates the<br />\nsame should be promptly and summarily dealt<br />\nwith. It is hoped, however, that a recognition<br />\nof the importance of proper training, if honors<br />\nare to be won for the University, will inspire<br />\nour athletes with a devotion to their work<br />\nthat will make such an unpleasant task entirely<br />\nuncalled for.<br />\n<br />\n3ffair0 of a ortnflpt.<br />\n<br />\n5<br />\n<br />\nways win. Competition/ is a good thing in<br />\ntrade and on the track. Defeat, though a bitter dose, may prove a powerful stimulant.<br />\nThe recent resolute stand of the Virginia<br />\nMilitary Institute in dismissing an entire graduating class for a breach of discipline is calculated to spread terror in the heart of the<br />\nundergraduate in all sections. For a time the<br />\nauthorities seem to be on top. Whether this<br />\nterror struck the heart of the Class of<br />\nNaughty-Naught, or whether they swore off,<br />\nfrom purely philanthropic motives, does not<br />\nappear. At any rate, the Juniors will make<br />\nno effort to molest the freshmen on the eve<br />\nof their banquet. Since the upper-classmen<br />\nare supposedly on the aggressive, the freshmen will have no grounds for retaliation. It<br />\nlooks as though the chief of the few traditional<br />\ncustoms of Hopkins has been kidnapped by the<br />\nfaculty. Timid mothers may no longer hesitate to send their sons to our model and moral<br />\nschool.<br />\n<br />\nThe subject for the inter-class debate in<br />\nMarch has been announced, and Professor<br />\nAdams has again generously offered a trophy,<br />\nand medals for the successful contestants.

Long-Distance Running.<br />\n<br />\nBy long-distance running is understood a<br />\nrace of one-half mile or over, the usual distances being 88o yards, one, and three miles.<br />\nI. GENERAL CONDITIONS.<br />\n<br />\n(a) Physical Examination.\u2014No one should<br />\nbegin to train for any athletic contest without an assurance that his heart and lungs<br />\nare in good condition.<br />\n(b) Preliminary Work.\u2014Should be begun<br />\nin the gymnasium in the winter and should<br />\nconsist of a general development, especial attention being paid to the chest and arms. A<br />\nrunner not infrequently tires in his arms before<br />\nhis legs are exhausted. All kinds of heavy<br />\nwork render the muscles sluggish and should<br />\nbe avoided.<br />\n(c) Diet.\u2014It is just as necessary to cultivate a good, strong stomach as a good pair of<br />\nlegs. This can only be done by at all times<br />\nabstaining from articles of food and drink<br />\nwhich cause indigestion. The question of diet<br />\nis largely a personal matter. In general, however, the following articles are tabooed in season and out of season : Alcoholic liquors, tobacco, mince pie, boiled cabbage, etc. In general, meats and eggs tend to produce strength,<br />\nwhile carbohydrates (brea(l, fruits and vegetables) induce flesh. A person should be governed by no hard and fast rules in the matter<br />\nof diet, hut should take such food and in such<br />\nquantities as his appetite demands.<br />\n(d) Baths and Massage are very helpful.<br />\nThe bath should be begun warm, and gradually<br />\ntempered down to cold.<br />\nFor rubbing, alcohol and witch hazel make<br />\na good liniment, but the rubbing is more important than the material used.<br />\n<br />\ntance races. One should not think of contenting himself with a stride of less than five feet,<br />\nwhile seven and a half feet are within the range<br />\nof possibility of long-legged individuals.<br />\nTo further this end, one should plant one<br />\nfoot immediately in front of the other. This<br />\nis best learned by running on a chalked line.<br />\nOne's arms should not be carried as dead wood,<br />\nbut should be freely swung from before backwards, never from side to side. One should<br />\nnot hesitate to use the mouth in breathing when<br />\n\" winded.\"<br />\n(b) Endurance.\u2014 The average neophyte<br />\noverdoes the thing from the start ; becomes<br />\nstiff, sore, discouraged, and soon quits. Let<br />\nus suppose a man is training for the mile run.<br />\nHe should by no means run the full distance<br />\nthe first day. A quarter of a mile at a moderate gait is sufficient for a first trial. Very<br />\ngradually increase this distance until the full<br />\nlimit is reached, all the time paying due attention to form. One should not, even then,<br />\nrun the full distance at top speed more than<br />\nonce a week. On other days, practice starting,<br />\nsprints, and quarters. Occasionally one should<br />\nrun a little farther than his distance. Most<br />\nmen do best by training daily; some by working two or three times a week. If one feels<br />\nstale, he should never go on the track.<br />\nIII. RACE.<br />\n<br />\nNo really hard work should be done for five<br />\nor six days prior to a race, and no work whatever should be attempted on the day preceding.<br />\nThe meal prior to a race should be a light<br />\none and should be taken from two to three<br />\nhours in advance of the event. But little fluid<br />\nshould be drunk.<br />\nThe most important point in a race is to<br />\nknow one's ability and to run accordingly.

OTTLEY.<br />\n,b$<br />\nGOSSIP OF THE COITION ROOM<br />\n<br />\nDr. Crenshaw has issued a call to the classes<br />\nto prepare their entries in the athletic exhibition, which is to be held in March, and has<br />\nmade known the conditions of competition.<br />\nEach class is to have at least ten men in the<br />\nfree exercises, five, or all of whom, are to enter<br />\nthe parallel bar, horse, and possibly the horizontal bar exercises. There must also be a tugof-war team from each class. No man may<br />\ncompete unless he is a regular attendant at the<br />\ngymnasium from February 5th on. The scoring will be five for a first, three for a second,<br />\nand two for a third. The class which has the<br />\nhighest score will win the University trophy.<br />\nMr. William Hilles will give a gold medal<br />\nfor wrestling ; Mr. James L. McLane, a medal<br />\nfor all-around gymnastics ; Lieutenant James<br />\nHughes, a member of the championship tug-ofwar team in 1896, a medal for this contest.<br />\nE. D. Loane.

It would<br />\nbe a source of thanksgiving and pride to ourselves, and our posterity to the third and fourth<br />\ngeneration. The press of the land would herald the news to the remotest quarters. The<br />\nsons of old Eli would clasp hands with us<br />\nover the humbling of their ancient rival.<br />\n<br />\nThe date of the inter-collegiate gymnastic<br />\ncontest, to be held under the auspices of the<br />\nNew York University, in their gymnasium at<br />\nUniversity Heights, New York City, has been<br />\nset for Friday evening, March 24. A cup for<br />\nfirst, second and third places will be given in<br />\nthe following events : Rings, horizontal bar,<br />\ntumbling, parallel bars, club-swinging, and<br />\nhorse. A cup will also be presented to the contestant making the greatest number of points<br />\nin the all-round competition, he to be known<br />\nas the champion all-round college gymnast.<br />\nThis meet will be the first of its kind ever atii<br />\ntempted, and the promoters are making great<br />\nIt is probable that the baseball team will efforts to make it a great success.

Several photographs of General Lee,<br />\ntogether with a number of specimens of manuscript written while he was in command at<br />\nWest Point, and later when he was President<br />\nof Washington and Lee, were presented to the<br />\nUniversity, and will be placed in the Donovan<br />\nRoom. Mr. Hulliken was elected president of<br />\nthe Association for the ensuing year, and Mr.<br />\nCanter secretary, and an executive committee<br />\nwas appointed.<br />\nShortly after the death of Dr. Louis E. Livingood in the La Bourgogne disaster of July<br />\nlast, it was proposed to establish a permanent<br />\nmemorial to him in connection with the Pathological Department of the Johns Hopkins<br />\nHospital, in which he was an associate, and in<br />\nwhich he took particular interest. This movement originated among the men of Princeton,<br />\nwhere Dr. Livingood was graduated in 189o,<br />\nhut it soon spread to this University. Under<br />\nthe direction of Dr. J. M. T. Finney, a considerable fund has been collected. The memorial<br />\nwill probably consist of a collection of pathological books suitably inscribed to commemorate the honesty of purpose and remarkable<br />\ndegree of success which were typified in the<br />\nlife of Dr. Livingood.<br />\n<br />\nThere is a general tendency among the universities to try to place themselves in closer<br />\nsympathy with the masses of the people. President Gilman and Professor Remsen, as well as<br />\nother members of this University, have delivered addresses in various parts of the country<br />\non this subject. Mr. George T. Powell, of<br />\nNew York, recently lectured here on the extension of university methods and ideas to the<br />\ncommon schools of the country districts. In<br />\n<br />\nan interesting way he showed a method of<br />\nsolving many of the spectre-like economic and<br />\nsocial problems that stare us in the face by inculcating the proper ideas in the minds of the<br />\ncountry children, and by arousing in them an<br />\nimproving interest in the life around them.<br />\n,(51<br />\nOne of the most interesting lectures in the<br />\nteachers' course which Dr. Adams has instituted, was that entitled The Land of Shakespeare, given by Professor Albert H. Smyth,<br />\nformerly librarian of this University, and now<br />\nprofessor of English in the Central High<br />\nSchool of Philadelphia. Dr. Smyth is an eminent Shakespearean scholar and the author of<br />\na recently published monograph, Shakespeare's<br />\nPericles and Apollonius of Tyre. His lecture<br />\nlast Friday related especially to the early environment and education of Shakespeare, to the<br />\nscenery and the historic associations of Warwickshire, to the famous affair with Sir<br />\nThomas Lucy, and the houses in Stratford connected with Shakespeare's life and family.<br />\nHopkins professors and graduates have been<br />\nespecially prominent among the writers of recently published books. Dr. William Keith<br />\nBrooks has collected the lectures he delivered<br />\nbefore the graduate students of Johns Hopkins and of Columbia, and the Macmillan Company presents them as The Foundations of<br />\nZoology in the Columbia University Biological<br />\nseries. Dr. Herbert Adams has published his<br />\nstudies on the relations of Jared Sparks and<br />\nAlexis de Tocqueville. The History of State<br />\nBanking in Maryland, by H. C. Bryan, a former Hopkins student, furnishes valuable information on monetary problems which Maryland has encountered ; while Dr. James has<br />\ngiven to colonial history an exhaustive account<br />\nof the Labadist movement in Maryland. Mr.<br />\nSchmekebier's History of the Know-Nothing<br />\nParty in Maryland is another contribution of<br />\nthe Johns Hopkins to historical and political<br />\nscience,<br />\n<br />\n\f...

The first of these facts might be<br />\ncalled the building up of the modern worldEvery decade destroys more and<br />\nmarket.<br />\nmore completely that local economic isolation<br />\nwhich was the rule before the introduction of<br />\nsteam power in manufactures and transportation. The growing relative importance of foreign trade as a factor in national prosperity is<br />\nmore and more apparent. It is rapidly coming<br />\nto be the dominant factor. National isolation<br />\nin economic matters is becoming ever more<br />\nimpossible. The German Government by its<br />\nrules for meat inspection can dictate how our<br />\nbeef and pork shall be produced and prepared. We cannot lay a new import duty<br />\nwithout a storm of angry protests from foreign<br />\ncountries. The price of our wheat and our<br />\nsilver is fixed in London. There tends more<br />\nand more to be a world rate of interest on loans<br />\nof capital.<br />\nOur earlier policy of national isolation in<br />\npolitical affairs rested upon the fact of economic isolation due to the existence of no better motive power than wind for ocean transportation. There can be little doubt that were<br />\nWashington alive today he would express decided views in favor of our national expansion. Privately and officially he was always<br />\nin favor of expansion. He planned to secure<br />\ncanals and roads into the country across the<br />\nAlleghenies in order to prevent the population there from going over to Louisiana. He<br />\nforesaw much of the expansion of the country<br />\nand favored governmental action to secure<br />\nthat expansion. And he saw that the extent<br />\nof expansion depended primarily upon the conManila today is<br />\ndition of transportation.<br />\nnearer to the United States than was the Mis-<br /><br />\nNo. 9<br /><br />\nsissippi in Washington's time to the thirteen<br />\noriginal State's. Mere separation by sea is no<br />\nlonger a real obstacle to national expansion.<br />\nIf the question of military defense be raised, a<br />\nglance at our history shows that we have<br />\nalways been more conspicuously capable in seafighting than in land-fighting.<br />\nThe second economic fact in favor of expansion is the recent rapid growth in our exports<br />\nof manufactures. Since 1888 our yearly exports of iron and steel have increased fourfold<br />\nin value, copper and its manufactured products<br />\nninefold, agricultural implements threefold,<br />\npaper over fivefold. Our total exports of manufactures were, in 1888, $13o,000,000 ; in<br />\n1898, $29o,000,000. This is not a mere temporary spurt, but rests on deep and permanent<br />\nmovements. We have completed the extensive occupation of our territory and have developed our manufacturing power beyond the<br />\nAnyone who<br />\nneeds of our home market.<br />\nknows our national characteristics in business<br />\nknows that henceforth, whatever policy the<br />\ngovernment may adopt for the time, our manufactures as well as our agricultural products<br />\nwill seize wider and wider markets in the<br />\nworld. We are entering the general struggle<br />\nfor supremacy in the world's commercial and<br />\nfinancial market to win. It lies within the<br />\nchoice of our Government to accept or to<br />\nthrow away a magnificent position of advantage in this struggle. It is not the trade of the<br />\nPhilippines which is at stake. That is a mere<br />\nbagatelle. The demand of China and other<br />\nEastern countries for modern manufactures<br />\nwill grow soon to enormous proportions. By<br />\ngeographical position we naturally ought to<br />\nhave the lion's share in that development.<br />\nPlanting ourselves firmly in the Southern Pacific as we have in the Northern, we shall be<br />\nable to check the efforts of European nations<br />\nto squeeze us out of this trade, We must con-<br /><br />\n2<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br /><br />\nvince Asia and Europe that we mean to hold<br />\nour own in this struggle. Commerce is not a<br />\nbenevolent understanding in which each party<br />\ntries to give away the utmost to his neighbor.<br />\nIt is an active struggle between rivals, and<br />\nmust be aggressive in every legitimate way.<br />\nWe ought to have a national spirit in this matter and an alert governmental policy to push<br />\nour commercial interests.<br />\nWould the holding of the Philippines be<br />\nunjust to their people ? Look at the facts.<br />\nWould their abandonment to the scramble of<br />\nthe European nations be any more just? They<br />\nare now incapable of self-government, and<br />\ncannot defend themselves against Europe. We<br />\nhave done the last act in rendering them helpless. We would be dishonorable in the last degree to abandon them now. Our duty and our<br />\ninterest in this case coincide.<br />\nIf there be a constitutional objection\", as Jefferson thought there was in the case of Louisiana, why not amend the Constitution ? Our<br />\nfathers, whom we so deeply malign by trying<br />\nto make them out to be the enemies of progress,<br />\nprovided a way by which the Constitution<br />\nmight be changed.<br />\nOne thing is certain : Our people, with the<br />\nsure instinct of their race, have seized the logic<br />\nof the situation. They have always expanded,<br />\nand they always will until the growth of national spirit is checked and decadence sets in.<br />\nSIDNEY SHERWOOD.<br /><br />\npulse and am confident that I can govern an<br />\nisland,' And so we say of ourselves. But are<br />\nyou sure of this ? We have no such need of<br />\ncolonizing as Great Britain, with her small<br />\ninsular area and surplus population. Our situation is rather like Russia in creeping over<br />\na continent, and making one vast area from<br />\nocean to ocean the sphere of our influence.<br />\nShould it appear that in order to gain a colonial trade worth $500,000 our corresponding<br />\nexpenditure would be $1,000,000, we should<br />\nnot be the gainers by such a trade, but losers,<br />\nand with this disadvantage\u2014that the burden<br />\nof expenditure would fall upon our whole people, while the gain would be mostly the monopoly of a favored few.<br />\n\"Then, as to the government of such colonies, if, as Great Britain treated us, our great<br />\neffort would be the greed of gain in a new<br />\nmarket, as spirited a race might in time win<br />\ntheir own independence of us and condemn our<br />\ncourse in history. But if, on the other hand,<br />\nwe hold the mastery over a subject race, then<br />\nretribution may await us as in 186r. At all<br />\nevents, what Burke said should be remembered\u2014that a nation should not seek to govern<br />\nanother people by their own methods without<br />\ndue deference to the tastes and habits of the<br />\npeople themselves.\"<br />\nos<br />\nTHE PUBLIC DEBATE.<br /><br />\nThe provisional debating teams of the Senate<br />\n.14<br />\nand House have been selected, and have already<br />\nANOTHER POINT OF VIEW.<br />\nbegun active training.

Any<br />\nman who fails to appear at the appointed<br />\ntimes will be summarily dropped, and his place<br />\nfilled by another member of his class. Dr.<br />\nLee has appointed nine men from each body<br />\non the so-called provisional teams. From these,<br />\nthree on each side will be retained to act as<br />\nadvisers to the actual speakers. Their names<br />\nwill be announced about the middle of February. Of the remaining candidates, three<br />\nwill be chosen as the speakers on each side, all<br />\nof whom will have an alternate. This last<br />\nselection will not be made until about the<br />\noth of March.<br />\nThe work of training for the debate will be<br />\nunder the general supervision of Dr. Lee.<br />\nEach team has had a chairman appointed from<br />\nits own members, who has direct charge of the<br />\nmen, and will report to Dr. Lee. John C.<br />\nFrench and W. P. Shriver hold these offices<br />\namong the Seniors and Juniors, respectively.<br />\nIn this way the contestants are thrown somewhat on their own resources, and are made to<br />\nfeel the necessity of hard, conscientious work<br />\nin preparation.<br />\nOn the same evening picked members of the<br />\nfreshman class will hold a contest in public<br />\nspeaking. Preliminary selections have already<br />\nbeen made from that class, and the speakers<br />\nwill soon be finally decided.<br />\nDr. Adams has generously offered, as he<br />\ndid last year, to provide a trophy to be contested for by the teams, and also individual<br />\nprizes for the various successful speakers. A<br />\nnumber of prominent lawyers of the city will<br />\nbe asked to serve as judges of the contests, and<br />\neverything points to a most successful evening.<br />\nDr. Lee has made the following appointments : Robert H. Grimes ('99), Chairman<br />\n-of general Committee of Arrangements. Chairmen of sub-committees : James L. A. Burrell (1900), Invitations; G. Canby Robinson<br />\n('99), Reception; J.

By the<br />\nwill of Johns, Hopkins, the most of his large<br />\nestate was bequeathed to a board of trustees,<br />\nwhom he had previously selected, to manage<br />\nthe University and Hospital that bear his name.<br />\nOf these trustees Galloway Cheston was president. The remaining members of the board<br />\nwere George W. Dobbin, George William<br />\nBrown, Francis King, Thomas M. Smith,<br />\nJames Carey Thomas, Charles J. M. Gwinn,<br />\nLewis N. Hopkins, Reverdy Johnson, Jr., and<br />\nFrancis White. Their first meeting after Mr.<br />\nHopkins' death was held February 6, 1874, so<br />\nthat just twenty-five years have passed since<br />\nthey undertook their responsibility.<br />\nOnly three of the members of the board are<br />\nnow living, namely : Francis White, treasurer ; Lewis N. Hopkins, secretary, and Reverdy Johnson, who was for several years chairman of the executive committee.<br />\nIn commemoration of this beginning of<br />\nthe work, the trustees have requested President<br />\nGilman to deliver a discourse on The History<br />\nand Prospects of the Johns Hopkins University. The exercises will be held in McCoy Hall<br />\nand as usual everyone belonging to the University is expected to be present. A number<br />\nof degrees will be conferred. It is expected<br />\nthat on that day recently painted portraits of<br />\nProfessor Sylvester and of Professor Remsen<br />\nwill be presented to the University.<br />\nThe Alumni Association of the University<br />\nwill hold its annual dinner on the evening of<br />\nCommemoration Day at the Rennert. Rev.<br />\nMaltbie D. Babcock, D. D., pastor of Brown<br />\nMemorial Church, will speak on The Proper<br />\nRelations of College Men to the Poor and the<br />\nAfflicted in a Large City.

OTTLEY'S timely article in this issue on<br />\nLong-Distance Running suggests the vital importance of training to the athlete, whether<br />\nfor track or field. It is a dangerous, certainly a foolish, risk for a man whose general physical condition has been impaired,<br />\neither through self-indulgence or the sedentary<br />\nlife of the student, to submit himself to the<br />\nsevere strain on nerves, heart, and lungs involved in athletic competition. While the end<br />\nof athletics is not prizes, but the pleasure of<br />\ncompetition, and the physical benefit to be derived, a man out of condition misses all of<br />\nthese. He wins no prizes, reflects no credit on<br />\nthe colors he wears, and is more than likely to<br />\nsuffer physical harm. If Hopkins athletes are<br />\nnot well trained, it is their own fault. Every<br />\nreasonable facility is afforded them : the new<br />\ngymnasium, complete in its equipment of apparatus and baths ; a cage for indoor pracTHE NEWS-LETTER in this issue prints two tice, up to date in all its appointments ; rubtimely articles on Expansion\u2014one from the bers, and witch hazel ad libitum, and an outpen of Dr. Sherwood, associate professor of door director, who, from his long experience,<br />\neconomics ; the other, an interview with Pro- ought to be qualified to give every needed adfessor Schouler, now lecturing at the Univer- vice. Little more could be asked. It means<br />\nsity. Mr. Ottley, of the Medical School, who that apart from these outside agencies there<br />\nlast spring won the mile walk for Hopkins at must be, inside the man, a determination to live<br />\nthe Princeton games, furnishes the second in up to the spirit of the training pledge ; that he<br />\nthe series of Points on Athletics. In the next will conscientiously and without prodding folnumber Mr. F. J. Walz, local forecast official, low the advice of the trainer. Nothing short<br />\nstationed at the Hopkins Observatory, will tell of this is enough.<br /><br />\nCHANGES in the Board of Editors noted above<br />\nhave been occasioned by the resignation of<br />\nJohn C. French as editor-in-chief because of<br />\nexacting editorial work on The Hullabaloo.<br />\nMr. French has been identified with THE<br />\nNEWS-LETTER almost from its inception, and<br />\nin the line of editorial succession followed<br />\nEdgeworth Smith, the founder of the paper.<br />\nA conscientious editor and painstaking writer,<br />\nhe has contributed largely to make the paper<br />\nwhat it is\u2014without a long blast from our own<br />\nhorn\u2014a not unworthy representative of Johns<br />\nHopkins in the field of college journalism. The<br />\nstaff takes this way of making permanent an<br />\nexpression of their warm personal regard for<br />\nMr. French, and the pleasure they have had in<br />\nsharing with him the work of \"getting out the<br />\npaper.\"<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\nHopkins teams have suffered in other days<br />\nfrom a representation of poorly trained men.<br />\nFlagrant breaches of training rules witnessed<br />\non the baseball team last season color the mind<br />\nlike a bad dream. But there is reason now to<br />\nexpect better things. By a rule of the gymnasium committee of the faculty, further<br />\nadopted by the Board of the Athletic Association, the outdoor director is held responsible<br />\nfor the physical condition of the men in his<br />\ndepartment, candidates for, and members of<br />\nteams. The University will look to the outdoor director to strictly enforce the training<br />\nrules. A man who intentionally violates the<br />\nsame should be promptly and summarily dealt<br />\nwith. It is hoped, however, that a recognition<br />\nof the importance of proper training, if honors<br />\nare to be won for the University, will inspire<br />\nour athletes with a devotion to their work<br />\nthat will make such an unpleasant task entirely<br />\nuncalled for.<br /><br />\n3ffair0 of a ortnflpt.<br /><br />\n5<br /><br />\nways win. Competition/ is a good thing in<br />\ntrade and on the track. Defeat, though a bitter dose, may prove a powerful stimulant.<br />\nThe recent resolute stand of the Virginia<br />\nMilitary Institute in dismissing an entire graduating class for a breach of discipline is calculated to spread terror in the heart of the<br />\nundergraduate in all sections. For a time the<br />\nauthorities seem to be on top. Whether this<br />\nterror struck the heart of the Class of<br />\nNaughty-Naught, or whether they swore off,<br />\nfrom purely philanthropic motives, does not<br />\nappear. At any rate, the Juniors will make<br />\nno effort to molest the freshmen on the eve<br />\nof their banquet. Since the upper-classmen<br />\nare supposedly on the aggressive, the freshmen will have no grounds for retaliation. It<br />\nlooks as though the chief of the few traditional<br />\ncustoms of Hopkins has been kidnapped by the<br />\nfaculty. Timid mothers may no longer hesitate to send their sons to our model and moral<br />\nschool.<br /><br />\nThe subject for the inter-class debate in<br />\nMarch has been announced, and Professor<br />\nAdams has again generously offered a trophy,<br />\nand medals for the successful contestants. It<br />\nwould be a good thing if something could be<br />\nsubstituted for the medals. The college man<br />\ndoes not wear his honors hung about his neck<br />\nlike a decoration from the Queen ; in truth,<br />\nhe has sufficient taste not to wear them at all.<br />\nHis medals, if he has any, ordinarily wind up<br />\nin the top bureau drawer, in later years to<br />\nbe given to the baby to cut his teeth on.

Long-Distance Running.<br /><br />\nBy long-distance running is understood a<br />\nrace of one-half mile or over, the usual distances being 88o yards, one, and three miles.<br />\nI. GENERAL CONDITIONS.<br /><br />\n(a) Physical Examination.\u2014No one should<br />\nbegin to train for any athletic contest without an assurance that his heart and lungs<br />\nare in good condition.<br />\n(b) Preliminary Work.\u2014Should be begun<br />\nin the gymnasium in the winter and should<br />\nconsist of a general development, especial attention being paid to the chest and arms. A<br />\nrunner not infrequently tires in his arms before<br />\nhis legs are exhausted. All kinds of heavy<br />\nwork render the muscles sluggish and should<br />\nbe avoided.<br />\n(c) Diet.\u2014It is just as necessary to cultivate a good, strong stomach as a good pair of<br />\nlegs. This can only be done by at all times<br />\nabstaining from articles of food and drink<br />\nwhich cause indigestion. The question of diet<br />\nis largely a personal matter. In general, however, the following articles are tabooed in season and out of season : Alcoholic liquors, tobacco, mince pie, boiled cabbage, etc. In general, meats and eggs tend to produce strength,<br />\nwhile carbohydrates (brea(l, fruits and vegetables) induce flesh. A person should be governed by no hard and fast rules in the matter<br />\nof diet, hut should take such food and in such<br />\nquantities as his appetite demands.<br />\n(d) Baths and Massage are very helpful.<br />\nThe bath should be begun warm, and gradually<br />\ntempered down to cold.<br />\nFor rubbing, alcohol and witch hazel make<br />\na good liniment, but the rubbing is more important than the material used.<br /><br />\ntance races. One should not think of contenting himself with a stride of less than five feet,<br />\nwhile seven and a half feet are within the range<br />\nof possibility of long-legged individuals.<br />\nTo further this end, one should plant one<br />\nfoot immediately in front of the other. This<br />\nis best learned by running on a chalked line.<br />\nOne's arms should not be carried as dead wood,<br />\nbut should be freely swung from before backwards, never from side to side. One should<br />\nnot hesitate to use the mouth in breathing when<br />\n\" winded.\"<br />\n(b) Endurance.\u2014 The average neophyte<br />\noverdoes the thing from the start ; becomes<br />\nstiff, sore, discouraged, and soon quits. Let<br />\nus suppose a man is training for the mile run.<br />\nHe should by no means run the full distance<br />\nthe first day. A quarter of a mile at a moderate gait is sufficient for a first trial. Very<br />\ngradually increase this distance until the full<br />\nlimit is reached, all the time paying due attention to form. One should not, even then,<br />\nrun the full distance at top speed more than<br />\nonce a week. On other days, practice starting,<br />\nsprints, and quarters. Occasionally one should<br />\nrun a little farther than his distance. Most<br />\nmen do best by training daily; some by working two or three times a week. If one feels<br />\nstale, he should never go on the track.<br />\nIII. RACE.<br /><br />\nNo really hard work should be done for five<br />\nor six days prior to a race, and no work whatever should be attempted on the day preceding.<br />\nThe meal prior to a race should be a light<br />\none and should be taken from two to three<br />\nhours in advance of the event. But little fluid<br />\nshould be drunk.<br />\nThe most important point in a race is to<br />\nknow one's ability and to run accordingly. Do<br />\nnot be led off into sprinting at first and break<br />\nII. TRAINING.<br />\ndown before the race is over.

OTTLEY.<br />\n,b$<br />\nGOSSIP OF THE COITION ROOM<br /><br />\nDr. Crenshaw has issued a call to the classes<br />\nto prepare their entries in the athletic exhibition, which is to be held in March, and has<br />\nmade known the conditions of competition.<br />\nEach class is to have at least ten men in the<br />\nfree exercises, five, or all of whom, are to enter<br />\nthe parallel bar, horse, and possibly the horizontal bar exercises. There must also be a tugof-war team from each class. No man may<br />\ncompete unless he is a regular attendant at the<br />\ngymnasium from February 5th on. The scoring will be five for a first, three for a second,<br />\nand two for a third. The class which has the<br />\nhighest score will win the University trophy.<br />\nMr. William Hilles will give a gold medal<br />\nfor wrestling ; Mr. James L. McLane, a medal<br />\nfor all-around gymnastics ; Lieutenant James<br />\nHughes, a member of the championship tug-ofwar team in 1896, a medal for this contest.<br />\nE. D. Loane.

It would<br />\nbe a source of thanksgiving and pride to ourselves, and our posterity to the third and fourth<br />\ngeneration. The press of the land would herald the news to the remotest quarters. The<br />\nsons of old Eli would clasp hands with us<br />\nover the humbling of their ancient rival.<br /><br />\nThe date of the inter-collegiate gymnastic<br />\ncontest, to be held under the auspices of the<br />\nNew York University, in their gymnasium at<br />\nUniversity Heights, New York City, has been<br />\nset for Friday evening, March 24. A cup for<br />\nfirst, second and third places will be given in<br />\nthe following events : Rings, horizontal bar,<br />\ntumbling, parallel bars, club-swinging, and<br />\nhorse. A cup will also be presented to the contestant making the greatest number of points<br />\nin the all-round competition, he to be known<br />\nas the champion all-round college gymnast.<br />\nThis meet will be the first of its kind ever atii<br />\ntempted, and the promoters are making great<br />\nIt is probable that the baseball team will efforts to make it a great success.

Several photographs of General Lee,<br />\ntogether with a number of specimens of manuscript written while he was in command at<br />\nWest Point, and later when he was President<br />\nof Washington and Lee, were presented to the<br />\nUniversity, and will be placed in the Donovan<br />\nRoom. Mr. Hulliken was elected president of<br />\nthe Association for the ensuing year, and Mr.<br />\nCanter secretary, and an executive committee<br />\nwas appointed.<br />\nShortly after the death of Dr. Louis E. Livingood in the La Bourgogne disaster of July<br />\nlast, it was proposed to establish a permanent<br />\nmemorial to him in connection with the Pathological Department of the Johns Hopkins<br />\nHospital, in which he was an associate, and in<br />\nwhich he took particular interest. This movement originated among the men of Princeton,<br />\nwhere Dr. Livingood was graduated in 189o,<br />\nhut it soon spread to this University. Under<br />\nthe direction of Dr. J. M. T. Finney, a considerable fund has been collected. The memorial<br />\nwill probably consist of a collection of pathological books suitably inscribed to commemorate the honesty of purpose and remarkable<br />\ndegree of success which were typified in the<br />\nlife of Dr. Livingood.<br /><br />\nThere is a general tendency among the universities to try to place themselves in closer<br />\nsympathy with the masses of the people. President Gilman and Professor Remsen, as well as<br />\nother members of this University, have delivered addresses in various parts of the country<br />\non this subject. Mr. George T. Powell, of<br />\nNew York, recently lectured here on the extension of university methods and ideas to the<br />\ncommon schools of the country districts. In<br /><br />\nan interesting way he showed a method of<br />\nsolving many of the spectre-like economic and<br />\nsocial problems that stare us in the face by inculcating the proper ideas in the minds of the<br />\ncountry children, and by arousing in them an<br />\nimproving interest in the life around them.<br />\n,(51<br />\nOne of the most interesting lectures in the<br />\nteachers' course which Dr. Adams has instituted, was that entitled The Land of Shakespeare, given by Professor Albert H. Smyth,<br />\nformerly librarian of this University, and now<br />\nprofessor of English in the Central High<br />\nSchool of Philadelphia. Dr. Smyth is an eminent Shakespearean scholar and the author of<br />\na recently published monograph, Shakespeare's<br />\nPericles and Apollonius of Tyre. His lecture<br />\nlast Friday related especially to the early environment and education of Shakespeare, to the<br />\nscenery and the historic associations of Warwickshire, to the famous affair with Sir<br />\nThomas Lucy, and the houses in Stratford connected with Shakespeare's life and family.<br />\nHopkins professors and graduates have been<br />\nespecially prominent among the writers of recently published books. Dr. William Keith<br />\nBrooks has collected the lectures he delivered<br />\nbefore the graduate students of Johns Hopkins and of Columbia, and the Macmillan Company presents them as The Foundations of<br />\nZoology in the Columbia University Biological<br />\nseries. Dr. Herbert Adams has published his<br />\nstudies on the relations of Jared Sparks and<br />\nAlexis de Tocqueville. The History of State<br />\nBanking in Maryland, by H. C. Bryan, a former Hopkins student, furnishes valuable information on monetary problems which Maryland has encountered ; while Dr. James has<br />\ngiven to colonial history an exhaustive account<br />\nof the Labadist movement in Maryland. Mr.<br />\nSchmekebier's History of the Know-Nothing<br />\nParty in Maryland is another contribution of<br />\nthe Johns Hopkins to historical and political<br />\nscience,<br /><br />\n...
