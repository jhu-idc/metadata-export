According to 3400's<br />\nprogram of events, this year's rejuvenation is to be effected<br />\nthrough \"fond memories, fun, and entertainment:\"<br />\nWe cannot disagree wtih those who hold that nostalgia, fun and<br />\nentertainment are appropriate ways to celebrate the arrival of<br />\nspring. But a far more important arrival, that of<br />\nUniversity-community coopertaion and involvement, ahs yet to be<br />\nrealized.<br />\nLooking back on our \"fond memories,\" we may find that the<br />\nformer isolation of the University from the life and lives which<br />\nsurrounded it during the days which we now celebrate indeed still<br />\nare still with us today, rendered far more disconcerting by the<br />\ncomplexity of the modern problems facing both the community<br />\nand the University.<br />\n<br />\nIn other opening day action.<br />\n<br />\nConfromtation of urban problems, such as housing, pollution,<br />\ntransportation, and eroding educational systems, should not rest<br />\nsolely upon the shoulders of community leaders. Rising housing<br />\ncosts effect Hopkins students as much if not more than they do<br />\nthe area wage-earner. The air on the Homewood campus is no<br />\ncleaner than that on the other side of Charles Street. In short, the<br />\nproblems of the community cannot be entirely differentiated from<br />\nthose of the University, and until both institutions resolve to<br />\nconfront them together, neither will be able to celebrate the<br />\narrival of spring without ignoring their present conditions and<br />\nlookind fondly back to a time when things seemed to be a little<br />\nbetter.<br />\n<br />\n\u2022 \u2022<br />\n<br />\nphoto essay<br />\nby bill waters<br />\n<br />\nletters<br />\nto the editor<br />\n<br />\nWhile the Orioles were .taking batting<br />\npractice before opening day victory over the<br />\nMilwaukee Brewers, hundreds of fa<br />\n. ns<br />\nshowed up jor a noontime rally last Thursday at Hopkins Plaza, located in downtown's<br />\nCharles Center.<br />\nAt least one of the fans was celebrating<br />\nbefore the ballgame even started.<br />\nOther photos show a superfan hawking<br />\nsouveneirs; the Baltimore Post Office's 5man Dixieland band; and one warmly<br />\nbundled girl, whose face seems to tell<br />\nanother story.<br />\n<br />\n04,610120/300<br />\n\u00b0Oelt<br />\n40000i00. 41<br />\n,0i005<br />\n4\".\u00b0<br />\n<br />\n00\u00b013<br />\n<br />\n(:f1!\u2022<br />\ntelifteogicr00,0410<br />\nr<br />\n<br />\n4<br />\n<br />\n4<br />\n<br />\n00'0600vt,<br />\n09\u00a700600<br />\n00000P.<br />\n45\u00b0000<br />\n* At;<br />\n<br />\nCaveat Emptor<br />\nTo the Editors:<br />\nDean Suskind recently<br />\nrecommended, and pushed<br />\nthrough, certain alterations in<br />\nacademic guidelines.

This letter<br />\nis meant for all those \"Indians.\"<br />\nI was one of the lucky chiefs<br />\nwho, very early in his career here,<br />\nlearned how important these<br />\nIndians were to any success he<br />\nmight have. I faced a number of<br />\nmajor and minor crises in my early<br />\ndays as Athletic Director\u2014most of<br />\nthem caused by my own<br />\ninexperience. These Indians were<br />\nconstantly bailing me out, and I<br />\nam very proud to say that some of<br />\nthose early Indians are still around,<br />\nare still helping me out, and I can<br />\nstill call them friends.<br />\n<br />\nThere is hardly an office or a<br />\nservice department in this<br />\nUniversity that we do not need in<br />\nsome degree to help put together a<br />\nsports and recreation program for<br />\nour students. Some of the<br />\nsecretaries and workers in these<br />\nplaces I know personally, but<br />\nmany I do not. I therefore wanted<br />\nto take this means to let every one<br />\nof these people know how much I<br />\nappreciate their help and effort<br />\nover the years. I can honestly say<br />\nthat if it were not for the support<br />\nof all these Indians, this<br />\nabout-to-be ex-chief would not<br />\nhave lasted as long as he did. My<br />\nsincerest thanks and best wishes to<br />\neach one of them.<br />\nMarshall S. Turner, Jr.<br />\nDirector of Athletics<br />\n<br />\nIn Baltimore<br />\n<br />\nLeft bank jazz society takes in some Mingus<br />\nBy ANDREW LASHLEY<br />\nOn entering the door beneath<br />\nThe Famous Ballroom marquee on<br />\nCharles Street, on is confronted by<br />\na flight of stairs leading to a<br />\ncavernous oom whose ceiling paint<br />\nroughly resembles a starlit sky. At<br />\nthe tope of the stairs the cavern<br />\nturns ou to be the dance floor of<br />\nthe Famous Ballroom, its<br />\nemmensity obscured by the tables<br />\nfull of people on hand for The Left<br />\nBank Jazz Society's presentation<br />\nof four hours' music by<br />\noutstntanding jazz artists. The<br />\nLBJS concerts run from iive p.m.<br />\nuntil nine p.m. on virtually every<br />\nSunday of the year, and reflect the<br />\ndifferent styles and directions of<br />\ncomtemporary jazz. Within the last<br />\n<br />\nyear bands ranigorng from Woody<br />\nHerman's orchestra to Pharoah<br />\nSander's quintet have played The<br />\nFamous, making it unique in his<br />\nsustained ability to present superb<br />\nand widely varied talent. The<br />\naudience is invariably receptive,<br />\nbul it maintains a sense of the<br />\ncriiieal oftentimes lacking in<br />\ncurrent rock audiences.<br />\nApplause After Breaks<br />\nLast Sunday's Left Bank Jazz<br />\nSociety's production featured the<br />\nCharles Mingus Quintet, with<br />\nMingus on bass, Roy Brooks,<br />\ndrums, George Adams, tenor sax,<br />\nCharles Mcgee, trumpet, and Ron<br />\n<br />\nPullen, piano. The quintet was<br />\nextremely capable as a group, and<br />\nequally competent in the solo<br />\ncategory. Adams and Mcgee<br />\nconsistently dazzled the audience<br />\nwith their virtuoso horn work,<br />\nwhich ranged from the beautifully<br />\nplacid to traumatically frantic.<br />\nBrooks demonstrated incredible<br />\nability on drums, drawing applause<br />\nat the end of each of his breaks.<br />\nPullen's keyboardwork was<br />\ncompetent, but not quite' up to the<br />\nflash of the Quintet's horn section<br />\nor Brook's drumming. Mingus did<br />\nnot stnad out in terms of his solo<br />\nplaying, but his underlying<br />\n<br />\n3400 on stage<br />\n<br />\npresence was the unifying factor<br />\nabove all Mingus makes the band<br />\none f the tightest in jazz.<br />\nA Major Force<br />\nMingus has been one of the<br />\nmajor forces in jazz since the<br />\n1950's. The list of greats with<br />\nwhome he has played includes<br />\nCharlie Parker, Stan Getz, Thad<br />\nJones, Art Tantum, and Eric<br />\nDolphy. He has always been a<br />\ncontroversial figure in terms of<br />\nboth his music andh is life. Mingus'<br />\nrole ,as a musical crusader spans<br />\never twenty years of constant<br />\nwarfare with dishonest promoters,<br />\ncorrupt record companies, and<br />\nracial prejudice. He has chronicled<br />\nhis struggles in an autobiography<br />\n<br />\nand<br />\nhas attempted<br />\nto<br />\ncircumvent the pitfalls of the<br />\nmusic industry by forming several<br />\nmusicians cooperative labels.<br />\nMingus' music is highly, eclectic,<br />\nas evidenced by last Sunday's<br />\nconcert, which featured a range<br />\nfrom the latest trends in<br />\ninpressionistic jazz to an almost<br />\npurely traditional blues number.<br />\nAlthough he never broke through<br />\nwith the sole bass lines for which<br />\nhe is famous, his strong bass<br />\ncounterpoint to the horn section<br />\nwas overpowering. Mingus'<br />\nseething presence was the factor<br />\nthat carried the Quintet's<br />\nperformance, and made the highly<br />\ncomplex music intelligible to the<br />\nnon-initiates present.<br />\n<br />\nNEws-IrrirER<br />\n<br />\nTHI<br />\neditor-in-chief<br />\nbusiness manager<br />\ncontributing editors<br />\nday editors<br />\nmanaging editors<br />\nphotography editors<br />\nsports editor<br />\ncirculation manager<br />\nphoto-production manager<br />\n<br />\n'I WAS ALWAYS THANKFUL HE WASN'T A POLITICAL CARTOONIST!'<br />\n<br />\nGeriatric at the wheelof antique car<br />\nat last year's .7400 on stage<br />\n<br />\nRichard Waring<br />\nFred Slone<br />\nBill Abbott, B.H.

Noon Series on aspects of sleep<br />\nBy RICHARD BLAND<br />\n\"Sleep Onset and Hypnotic<br />\nDrugs\" was the topic of this<br />\nweek's Wednesday Noon Series,<br />\ndiscussed by Dr. Clinton Brown,<br />\nDirector of Basic Sciences<br />\nResearch at the Maryland<br />\nPsychiatric Center.<br />\nBrown, former director of<br />\nSleep Study Labs for the<br />\nDepartment of Psychiatry and<br />\nBehavioral Science from<br />\n1967-69, criticized the abuse of<br />\nsleeping aids and maintained that<br />\ntheir use is often harmful to<br />\nnormal sleeping habits.<br />\nBrown explained that a person<br />\nunder the influence of a sleeping<br />\npill \"was not asleep, but in a<br />\ndrugged state.\" He added that<br />\nsleep studies have indicated that<br />\npersons who do not use sleeping<br />\naids are \"better able to perform<br />\nthe task of being awake.\"<br />\n\"One's level of awareness can<br />\nbe reduced by sleep-inducing<br />\ndrugs,\" Brown commented.<br />\nBrown described the four<br />\nlevels of sleep that are common<br />\nto human beings.<br />\nSleep begins, he explained,<br />\nwith a latency period of<br />\napproximately 17.5 minutes for<br />\nthe average person. At this point<br />\nthe first stage of sleep,<br />\ncharacterized by rapid eyeball<br />\nmovement (REM), usually<br />\ncommences. The REM stage, as<br />\nthis first level is called, is<br />\ncommonly associated with<br />\ndreaming.<br />\nThe period of deepest sleep,<br />\n<br />\nN<br />\n<br />\naccording to Brown, is stage four.<br />\nHe noted that sleep-walking,<br />\ntooth grinding, and bed-wetting<br />\noccur in this stage.<br />\nDuring the course of a night's<br />\nsleep, people cycle back and<br />\nforth between the four stages of<br />\nsleep, and may awaken for spells<br />\nduring the night without realizing<br />\nit, he added.<br />\nBrown also indicated that lab<br />\nstudies have shown stage four to<br />\nbe the most imnortant for<br />\nmetabolic andphysiological repair.<br />\nPatients who have been<br />\ndeprived of both REM and stage<br />\nfour sleep will inevitably make<br />\nup the stage four sleep first,<br />\nwhile letting the REM sleep wait.<br />\nREM-deprived patients exhibit<br />\nconfusion and irritability,<br />\n<br />\nSpeaking on the subject of<br />\nsleeping hypnotics, Brown noted<br />\nthat in Great Britain, the sale of<br />\nhypnotics surpasses that of<br />\nasprin. In the United States, he<br />\nsaid, there are 87 types of<br />\nhypnotics on the market, \"with<br />\nno real difference in content.\"<br />\nAnswering questions from an<br />\naudience of approximately thirty<br />\npersons, Brown maintained that a<br />\nshot of alcohol may be a helpful<br />\ninducer of sleep, but that<br />\nalcoholism is damaging to<br />\ngenerally healthy sleeping habits.<br />\nAnother questioner asked<br />\nwhether there was any \"normal\"<br />\namount of sleep for human<br />\nbeings. Brown answered that<br />\nalthough age could be a factor,<br />\nthere was really no such thing as<br />\n<br />\nDr. Clinton Brown<br />\na \"normal\" amount of sleep. He<br />\npeople in their fifties who are<br />\nstated that it varied from babies<br />\ngenerally accustomed to five or<br />\nwho sleep 72% of the time to<br />\nsix hours.<br />\n<br />\nPre-Meds face new recommendations plan<br />\nBy MITCH TENZER<br />\nHopkins students seeking<br />\nrecommendations to medical<br />\nschools in 1974 will receive them<br />\nfrom a new Pre -Medical<br />\nRecommendations Committee,<br />\nchaired by Dr. Martin Larrabee,<br />\nBiophysics.<br />\nThe committee system<br />\nreplaces the method used in<br />\nprevious years, which required<br />\nstudents to obtain<br />\nrecommendations from faculty<br />\nmembers with whom they were<br />\nfamiliar. According to Larrabee,<br />\n<br />\nthe procedure lack coordination.<br />\nThe old system resulted in a<br />\n\"phony\" recommendations<br />\ncommittee of some seventy<br />\nmembers, none of whome were<br />\nparticularly instructed in the<br />\nprocedures of writing<br />\nrecommendations. \"Once a<br />\nfaculty member. had been<br />\ncontacted by a student,\" said<br />\nLarrabee, \"he automatically<br />\nbecame a member.\"<br />\nThis year the Pre-Medical<br />\nRecommendations Committee<br />\nwill consist of 24 faculty<br />\nmembers, representing various A.<br />\n<br />\n& S. fields, including Social<br />\nSciences, Humanities, as well as<br />\nNatural Sciences.<br />\nThe chairman of the<br />\nCommittee will assign each<br />\napplicant to a Committee<br />\nmember who will be responsible<br />\nfor the preparation of the<br />\nstudent's recommendation. If a<br />\ncommittee member is already<br />\nacquainted with a student, the<br />\nstudent may request him to<br />\nprepare the recommendation.<br />\n\"We hope to overhaul the<br />\nsystem, to get it working better \u2022<br />\nby collecting more information<br />\n<br />\non the student and stressing<br />\nuniformity in recommendations<br />\nprocedures,'' commented<br />\nLarrabee.<br />\n\"Students may be uneasy<br />\nwith this new system, simply<br />\nbecause it is new and because the<br />\nold system did place 80 percent<br />\ninto med school,\" he<br />\ncommented.<br />\nHe asserted that the<br />\ncommittee system will protect<br />\nthe credibility of the<br />\nrecommendations so that \"we<br />\ncan get our best students into top<br />\nschools.\"<br />\n<br />\nL Hop-Comp<br />\n<br />\nDear Sirs:<br />\nW it h the rising composition costS in the printing field today,<br />\nhigh quality, attractive composition has<br />\nbeen priced out of the range of many<br />\npeople and organizations who might wish<br />\nto take advantage of this service.

Sanders<br />\ncommented that \"the magazine<br />\noverhaul is still not yet finished.<br />\n<br />\nIrwin heads new arts quarterly<br />\nBy A. P. SMITHWICK<br />\nA new quarterly of the arts,<br />\n\"Strivers' Row\", is to begin<br />\npublication this summer under<br />\nthe editorial and financial<br />\nauspices of Dr. John Irwin,<br />\nEnglish.<br />\nAccording to Irwin, the<br />\nmagazine will emphasize modern<br />\n\"synesthetic\" art, or that which<br />\nembodies two or more artistic<br />\ngenres.<br />\n\"An example of synesthetic<br />\nart would be a poem written in<br />\nthe shape of a sculpture,\" Irwin<br />\nsaid, continuing, \"Thus a [work<br />\nof] art will take on the<br />\n<br />\nachievment of another and try to<br />\nreproduce it.\".<br />\nThe, most widely-known<br />\nsynesthetic artist in the U.S.<br />\ntoday is e.e. cummings, whose<br />\npoetry achieves both audio and<br />\nfisual effect through the relative<br />\npositions of his lines, words, and<br />\npunctuation marks.<br />\nThe quarterly's board of<br />\nadvisory editors will include<br />\nnewly-appointed faculty member<br />\nand writer John Barth, Jackson<br />\nCope, a former English professor<br />\nhere, now occupying an endowed<br />\nchair at U.S.C., James Dickey,<br />\nWilliam Heyen, and other<br />\n<br />\nwell-known writers, critics,<br />\nmusicians, and artists.<br />\n\"We've successfully attracted<br />\nbig names to the magazine,\" said<br />\nIrwin, \"because when readers<br />\nrecognize these names they will<br />\nassume [the quarterly to be] of<br />\nhigh quality. These highly<br />\ntalented advisory editors will<br />\ncontribute and steer the efforts<br />\nof their friends.\"<br />\nContributors to the first issue<br />\nof the magazine include Joyce<br />\nCarol Oates, Mona Van Duyn,<br />\nMark<br />\nJohn Hollander,<br />\nMcClockey, and Monroe Spears.<br />\nBecause the quarterly is to be<br />\nfinanced completely by Irwin,<br />\nwithout advertixing revenues, a<br />\nspecial edition of each issue will<br />\nbe produced in order to establish<br />\na \"financial cushion\" with which<br />\nto survive the first few years of<br />\npublication.<br />\nIn reture for the $20 special<br />\nedition subscription fee, readers<br />\nwill receive manuscripts signed<br />\nby the authors, in addition to<br />\nspecially printed copies of<br />\netchings, prints, and paintings.<br />\n<br />\nMore ordering will have to be<br />\ndone over the summer. But by<br />\nfall, the magazine selection<br />\nshould be much better.\"<br />\nAmong The New<br />\nIn coordination with Dr.<br />\nRichard Macksey, Humanities<br />\nCenter, Sanders has introduced a<br />\nwide range of previously<br />\nand<br />\nun o ffe re d quarterlies<br />\njournals.

The Blue<br />\nJays and Cavaliers have virtually<br />\nshared the top spot in the major<br />\nlacrosse polls ever since the<br />\nseason's opening face off, but by<br />\nthe dinner hour one team will<br />\nstand alone.<br />\nPermeating the air tomorrow<br />\nwill be memories lingering from<br />\nthe last meeting of the titans,<br />\nwhen Virginia trimmed the Blue<br />\nJay feathers, 13-12, to capture<br />\nthe NCAA crown. Hopkins, solid<br />\nfavorites in that game, will seek<br />\nretaliation before the.anticipated<br />\n8000 Parents' Day spectators in<br />\nstriving to keep its unblemished<br />\n1973 record intact.<br />\nIn addition to being defending<br />\nNCAA campions, the Cavalier<br />\nsquad comes into Baltimore with<br />\ntwo consecutive Hero's<br />\nInvitational Tournament titles<br />\nunder its belt. There can be no<br />\ndoubt that Virginia is better in<br />\nevery phase of the game than any<br />\ncollege team Hopkins has faced<br />\nthis year.<br />\nThe Wahoos have a fine goalie<br />\nin Rod Rullman, a self-assured<br />\nsophomore with lightening quick<br />\nreflexes. After Virginia had<br />\nplodded halfway through a so-so<br />\nseason marked by indecision on<br />\nwhich of two freshman to use in<br />\nthe nets, Rullman earned the<br />\npost with a remarkable sequance<br />\nof goaltending. With Washington<br />\nand Lee leading 7-3 and ready to<br />\nput the game out of reach,<br />\nRullman blocked three point<br />\nblank shots within a five second<br />\nspan. This effort inspired his<br />\nteammates to a come from<br />\n<br />\nbehind victory which salvaged a<br />\nberth in the NCAA tourney. The<br />\nCavaliers have not lost since then<br />\nand own the longest winning<br />\nstreak among major powers.<br />\nRullman has continued his<br />\nsparkling display this season on<br />\nroute ter-unanimous selection as<br />\nthe Most Valuable Player in the<br />\nHero's Tourney. On successive<br />\ndays his presence stymied Carling<br />\nand Maryland as the Wahoos won<br />\nboth games by single goal<br />\nmargins to take the honors.<br />\nDefensively, Virginia fields an<br />\nexperienced trio composed of<br />\nsecond team All-American Bruce<br />\nMangeIs, Boo Smith, and Ed<br />\nSpencer that is the mainstay of<br />\nthe 1973 squad. MangeIs is a<br />\nsenior who has been a concensus<br />\nchoice as the premier crease<br />\ndefenseman in the country for<br />\ntwo years in a row. Smith has<br />\nalso performed well for the unit<br />\nand had one of his best games in<br />\nthe June finale last year. In that<br />\ngame he held fellow junior Jack<br />\nThomas to two goals and one<br />\nassist, giving up only one tally in<br />\nsettled situations. Spencet, now a<br />\nsophomore at Virginia, started<br />\nlast year and promises to pester<br />\nmany an attackman before he<br />\ngraduates. 4<br />\nLeading the Wahoos on attack<br />\nis senior Tom Duquette, who has<br />\nearned All-American recognition<br />\nall three years in Charlottesville.<br />\nNolonger eclipsed by Jay Connor,<br />\nwho graduated last year,<br />\nDuquette is thriving in his role as<br />\nthe cornerstone of the Cavalier<br />\noffense. Classmate Rick Bergland<br />\nis also having an excellent spring,<br />\nworking well with Duquette.<br />\nThe midfields are also strong<br />\nthreats at both ends of the field.<br />\nStandouts for Virginia include<br />\nsecond team All-American Doug<br />\nCooper and sophomore Richie<br />\nWerner. Both are crafty dodgers<br />\n<br />\nwho like to score and have<br />\nplayed will against Hopkins in<br />\nthe past.<br />\n\u2022 Coaclf Bob Scott looks forward<br />\nto another close contest as he<br />\nconsiders both clubs to be just<br />\nabout as strong as last year. For<br />\nrecent regular season encounters<br />\nwith the Cavaliers, 'Scott. has<br />\nunveiled surprise tactics such as<br />\nthe stall that almost upset the<br />\nvastly superior 1971 Wahoos.<br />\nAlthough he refused to admit<br />\nplanning anything special -for<br />\ntomorrow, Blue Jay fans should<br />\nnot be surprised if his sleeveful of<br />\ntricks catches Virginia off guard.<br />\nThe key to victory will be ball<br />\ncontrol and depends on having<br />\nthe Blue Jays pressure the Wahoo<br />\ndefense, so effective ground ball<br />\ncoverage is essential. A strong<br />\ndefensive effort and the<br />\n<br />\nLes Matthews directs Ferguson and Barbera on defense.<br />\navoidance of penalties which<br />\nhampered the June comeback<br />\nattempt will also be required.<br />\nWhatever the result, lacrosse<br />\n<br />\nHop thinclads place in tri-meet<br />\nBy CHUCK SLON1M<br />\nThe wintery winds of spring<br />\nstormed the ,Homewood' field<br />\nWednesday afternoon as the Blue<br />\nJay track team played host to<br />\nGettysburg and Albright<br />\nColleges. The Hopkins squad split<br />\nthe tri-meet, bowing to<br />\nGettysburg and leaving Albright<br />\nmuch behind. As the final event<br />\nfinished, the Jays saw themselves<br />\nwith 74 points, just shy of<br />\nGettysburg's 81 points and well<br />\nahead of Albright's 26.<br />\nThe meet got underway with<br />\nthe javelin, shot put, long jump,<br />\nand pole vault. Freshman Sty<br />\nDickinson vaulted 11'6\" to win<br />\n<br />\nthat event for the day. Although<br />\nthe second and third placers also<br />\ncleared that height, Dickinson<br />\nhad no misses making it on his<br />\nfirst try. Sophomore Jack<br />\nCoulter took fourth with an<br />\n1 1-foot vault. Meanwhile, ten<br />\nyeards behind the pole vault<br />\nrunway, junior Al Schiff,<br />\naveraging about 43 feet per<br />\nthrow, put the shot 44'21<br />\n/<br />\n2<br />\n\" on<br />\nhis sixth throw to capture first<br />\nplace in the shot put. Senior Hal<br />\nAltman brought in fourth place<br />\nwith a put of 41'91<br />\n/<br />\n2\".<br />\nDirectly beside both of these<br />\nevents, the long jump was taking<br />\nplace.

The polojays,<br />\nhopeful of attaining varsity status<br />\non the basis of strong showings in<br />\nmatches such as these, have been<br />\nlooking forward to this game for<br />\nweeks.<br />\nSince the club is trying to<br />\nimpress the community of its<br />\npotential as a varsity sport,<br />\ntonight's squad will consist<br />\nentirely of undergrads instead of<br />\nthe usual crew that includes<br />\ngraduates and other community<br />\nmembers.<br />\nVillanova is a member of the<br />\nEastern Conference and finished<br />\nthis season with a .500 record.<br />\nAlso a member of the conference<br />\nis east coast powerhouse Yale.<br />\nThe last time Villanova met<br />\nthe polojays was in October of<br />\n1971, when the visitors<br />\nchallenged the' Hopkins phys ed<br />\nclass.

The Hoyas<br />\nhanded the Blue Jays their worst<br />\nsetback of the season, 17-4. With<br />\nthe outcome determined early in<br />\nthe game, Coach Dennis Cox<br />\ntook advantage of the<br />\nopportunity to give many of his<br />\nfreshman invaluable playing<br />\nexperience against top-flight<br />\ncompetition.<br />\nGary Rostkowski, on of the<br />\nfreshmen Coach Cox was able to<br />\nget into the game, provided the<br />\nhighlight of the muzzled Hopkins<br />\nattack when he socked a 400<br />\nfoot home run.

Hopefully, Bill<br />\nJones' sore shoulder will have<br />\nhealed in time for him to pitch<br />\nagainst the Bears.

Though this was 20 feet<br />\nshy of the first place throw, it<br />\nwas far enough to capture second<br />\nplace. Sophomore John, Veil<br />\nfollowed Stenifels with a third<br />\nplace throw of 165'6\".<br />\nAltman won the discus with a<br />\nthrow of 1 25'8\", while<br />\nsophomore Louis Wolfin placed<br />\nthird.

This<br />\nmatch was both the first victory<br />\nfor the team and the first<br />\nMason-Dixon Conference match<br />\nof the season. In the past week<br />\nHopkins was shut out by<br />\nDelaware, Swathmore, and Navy<br />\nas Rob Fink's single set win<br />\nagainst Delaware was the only<br />\nbright spot in the three matches.<br />\nChilling<br />\nThings were different in the<br />\nchilling temperatures on<br />\nWednesday afternoon. In fact<br />\n<br />\nsports<br />\n<br />\nBaby Jay stickers are undefeated<br />\nBy MIKE LaTAPE<br />\nThe \"B\" lacrosse team has had<br />\na busy spring. Having emerged<br />\nvictorious in the nine scrimmages<br />\nand the one game already played,<br />\nthe Baby Jays were to have taken<br />\non arch-rival Towson State's JV<br />\nsquad. But due to a unique set of<br />\ncircumstances, Coach Willie<br />\nScroggs Was unable to et the<br />\ngame played.<br />\nIn addition to being<br />\nundefeated, Hopkins has outshot<br />\nand outgroundballed every<br />\nopponent, controlled at least half<br />\nthe lace-offs in each encounter,<br />\nand has cleared the ball much<br />\nbetter than the. opposition. With<br />\nthe exception of the Calvert Hall<br />\nscrimmage, the opposing goalie<br />\nhas been called on to make more<br />\nsaves than required of the<br />\nHopkins duo of Mike Godack<br />\nand Dave Wilbur.<br />\nScrimmage victims included<br />\nEssex C.C. (11-7), Loyola High<br />\n(8-4), the University of Notre<br />\nDame's fledgling Club (7-4),<br />\nArmy Prep, (16-7), Gilman<br />\n(12-6), Calvert Hall (13-4),<br />\nArchbishop Curley (14-2), UMBC<br />\nJV (9-6), and McDonough (5-3).<br />\nIn the lone game played to<br />\ndate, HOpkins outshot Anne<br />\nArundel C.C. by a. 54-27 margin<br />\nas the Baby Jays ran away with<br />\nthe 14-6 decision.<br />\nThe game started rather<br />\ninauspiciously for the Anne<br />\nArundel goalie. Four of the first<br />\nfive Baby Jay shots went. by him<br />\ninto the net for goals. Hopkins<br />\nenjoyed a 5-2 lead after the first<br />\nquarter. At the half, the lead had<br />\nbeen upped to 9-2.<br />\nIt was all downhill from there<br />\nas Scroggs freely substituted for<br />\nhis starters. The starting attack of<br />\nPaul Botzler, John Bender, \u2022 and<br />\nLarry Leonard accounted for<br />\nthree goals and four assists before<br />\nsitting down. But the bulk of the<br />\ngoals were scored by the first<br />\nmidfield of Randy Dase, font<br />\nCirillo, and Bruce Parker who<br />\ncombined for 7 goals and two<br />\nassists.<br />\n<br />\nGrabbing the rest of the points<br />\nwas the second midfield of Mike<br />\nCollins, Pete Barrow, and Bill<br />\n\"Pinky\" Norbeck. Top<br />\ngroundball hogs were Cirillo,<br />\nParker, and Harry Kogelschatz.<br />\nKogelschatz and Barrow<br />\ncontrolled 14 of the 25 face-offs<br />\ncontested.<br />\nIt was a dull game after the<br />\nfirst five minutes. The Baby Jays<br />\nwere by far the superior team as<br />\nthe starting defense of Mike.,<br />\nRiley, Bruce Shapiro, and Jim<br />\nMoorhead limited Anne Arundel<br />\nto only six shots on goal through<br />\nthe first three periods. In that<br />\nsame time, Hopkins poured 26<br />\nshots on goal with countless<br />\nothers just missing.<br />\nBut much better competition<br />\nis on the offing. Next week<br />\n<br />\nHopkins travels to St. Paul's on<br />\nMonday and entertains Nassau<br />\nC.C. on Thursday. Following<br />\nthose contests, the Baby Jays do<br />\nbattle with the Penn Frosh,,<br />\nCommunity College of<br />\nBaltimore, and the Navy Plebes.<br />\nOne thing that may hamper<br />\nthe Baby Jays as the season<br />\nprogresses is, being a \"B\" team,<br />\none .of their duties is to prepare<br />\nthe varsity for Saturday. As<br />\nHopkins gets closer to the end of<br />\nthe season and the play-offs,<br />\nmore and more pressure may be<br />\nplaced on the \"B\" squad to ready<br />\nthe varsity.<br />\nThat, along with the fact that<br />\nthey must share the practice field<br />\nwith the varsity, may not leave<br />\nthe \"13\" team with sufficient<br />\ntime to prepare for their games.<br />\n<br />\nHopkins won this match in<br />\nstraight sets. The winning<br />\nrun-down is as follows: first<br />\nsingles\u2014Ted Pabst 6-0, 6-3,<br />\nsecond singles\u2014John Newman<br />\n6-3, 6-2, third singles\u2014Rob Fink<br />\n6-2, 6-2, fourth singles\u2014Jeff<br />\nGould 6 -3 , 6-0. fifth<br />\nsingles\u2014Mark Unis 6-4, 7-5, sixth<br />\nsingles\u2014Jeff Rosenberg 6-2, 6-0,<br />\nfirst doubles\u2014Scott Broffman<br />\nand Iry Bonder 7-5, 7-6, and<br />\nsecond doubles Gary Swimmer<br />\nand Jerome Hansen in two sets as<br />\nwell. The third doubles was a<br />\nforfeit victory.<br />\nRecord<br />\nWith a 1-5 record the team<br />\nmight have its hardest matches of<br />\nthe season behind them. It was<br />\n<br />\npointed out to this reporter that<br />\nlast year while the team finished<br />\nwith a 10-5 record, the matches<br />\nlost then were the five lost thus<br />\nfar this year. However it is<br />\nsignificant that several of the top<br />\nperformers especially those who<br />\nwere expected to help carry the<br />\nteam, for various reasons are not<br />\nwith the squad this year.<br />\nRival<br />\nStill the prospects of a victory<br />\nin the Mason-Dixon League look<br />\nfairly good. The top rival for<br />\nHopkins will be Towson State.<br />\nThe match against Towson was<br />\nscheduled for yesterday and the<br />\nresults will be reported next<br />\nweek.<br />\n<br />\nBalto.'s bitter spring<br />\ntakes toll of golfers<br />\nBy JAY GOODGOLD<br />\nOn a day that one might prefer<br />\nto ski or ice skate, the Johns<br />\nHopkins Golf Team succombed<br />\nto the weather and finished third<br />\nin a match pitting them against<br />\nDickinson College and Delaware<br />\nValley.

Taking a<br />\n422 into the clubhouse, they<br />\nnosed out Dickinson 426, while<br />\nHopkins posted a dismal 441.<br />\nThe gusty winds, semi-frigid<br />\ntemperatures and wet grounds<br />\nconstantly hindered play on the<br />\ncourse as no player on any team<br />\ncame close to the par 71. The<br />\nbest card for the day was turned<br />\nin by Angelo Petraglia of<br />\nDelaware Valley, having shot 78.<br />\nThrough the first nine holes of<br />\nthe match, the Blue Jay golfers<br />\nheld their own as they were only<br />\nfour strokes behind the leader at<br />\nthe midway pint. But as the<br />\nweather chilled so did out<br />\n<br />\ngolfers. Frank Healey, Steve<br />\nErdman, Ken Leopold, Bill<br />\nBlubaugh, and Skip Miller, the<br />\nfive Blue Jays scoring for the<br />\nsquad, had final rounds of 85,<br />\n86, 87, 90, and 93 respectively.<br />\nCaptain Jay Conaty, finishing<br />\nsixth for Hopkins, tied Miller<br />\nwith a 93 on the back green.<br />\nInconsistant<br />\nCoach Win Smith felt that the<br />\nweather was most responsible for<br />\nthe team's poor showing<br />\nTuesday. He believed that the<br />\nmatch was inconsistant and<br />\nunreliable in judging a player's<br />\nperformance. He stated that on a<br />\nclear day a team's score would be<br />\n\"twenty strokes better.\"<br />\nTwo golfers, Bob Chimel and<br />\nChuck Brunicardi, were added to<br />\nthe golf team's starting line-up as<br />\nthey carded rounds of 81 and 85<br />\nrespectively in try-out runs at the<br />\nmatch.<br />\nThe team's next match is at<br />\nIi o me against F ordham this<br />\nafternoon.<br />\n<br />\nHas the slumber of Birds'sluggers ended?<br />\nBy MICHAEL BERESTON<br />\nThe baffling mystery of silent<br />\nbats among the Baltimore Orioles<br />\nwas once again opened to the<br />\npublic last week as the Memorial<br />\nStadium \u2022tenants began their<br />\n1973 season. Earl Weaver can<br />\nonly wait and see what happens<br />\nwhile some fans are already<br />\nhollering for Sherlock Holmes<br />\nand Watson to investigate.<br />\nThe Orioles have some<br />\nproblems but the pitching is not<br />\nsupposed to be of primary<br />\nconcern, although some feel the<br />\nBirds lack last season's depth<br />\ncourtesy of the Earl Williams<br />\ndeal. Pat Dobson and Rorie<br />\nHarrison are hard to replace but<br />\nMcNally and Cuellar's arms<br />\nshould have at least one or two<br />\nyears left with any kind of luck.<br />\nPalmer, barring injury, may<br />\n\"only\" have another ten solid<br />\nyears remaining in his powerful<br />\nright wing. Weaver s immediate<br />\nworry will be a replacement for<br />\nDobson, with Doyle Alexander<br />\nexpected to fill the void.<br />\n<br />\nAlexander has a history of erratic<br />\nperformances, but being given a<br />\npermanent spot in the rotation<br />\nmight allow him to \"find<br />\nhimselr' as a hurler.<br />\nThe vaunted Oriole defense<br />\nremains intact despite a loss in<br />\ndepth now that Johnson is gone.<br />\nThe result of this deal is that<br />\nBelanger will regain his starting<br />\nrole at shortstop and Grich's<br />\npermanent home will be second<br />\nbase. With Robinson at third and<br />\ndespite a mediocre Powell at<br />\nfirst, the Orioles have probably<br />\nthe best defensive infield in<br />\nbaseball.<br />\nBaseball experts have always<br />\nmaintained that championship<br />\nball clubs must be strong \"up the<br />\nmiddle.\" Having Mark Belanger<br />\nand Bobby Grich in the infield<br />\nand Paul Blair patrolling center<br />\nfield, the Orioles would seem to<br />\nbe in 'clover. Alongside Blair in<br />\ncenter, Don Baylor will start in<br />\nleft .field and Mery Rettenmund<br />\nwill cover right field. The<br />\nquestion mark lies behind the<br />\n<br />\nplate where heavy hitting Earl<br />\nWilliams brings a reputation of<br />\nsporadic fielding.<br />\nThe initial concern remains<br />\n<br />\nhitting with the only new<br />\naddition to the Oriole lineup<br />\nbeing Earl Williams. Fans should<br />\nnot get the wrong idea about the<br />\nformer Braves star. He is not<br />\nanother Frank Robinson and no<br />\none should expect him to be.<br />\nRobinson averaged 30 home<br />\nruns, 100 runs batted in, 100<br />\nruns scored, and a .300 batting<br />\naverage annually, not to mention<br />\nhis sensational fielding,<br />\nbaserunning and leadership.<br />\nWilliams has never been a .300<br />\nhitter, .nor a great fielder but he<br />\nhas power. If fan pressure lets up,<br />\nhe's capable of prod.\u2022ing<br />\nsomewhere around 40 home runs<br />\nin a season. There aren't many<br />\nFrank Robinsons around and the<br />\nOrioles did not acquire a new<br />\none. Instead they have a long ball<br />\nthreat backed up. by an entire<br />\nteam that is coming of an<br />\nuncharacteristically bad year at the<br />\nplate. It is unlikely they will<br />\nrepeat that feat. If this is the<br />\ncase, the American league is in<br />\nfor a lot of trouble.<br />\n<br />\n\fpage 16/news1etter/april 13, 1973<br />\n<br />\nLegislative Wrapup<br />\n<br />\nRent control, SB 848 get top University billing<br />\nBy BILL ABBOTT<br />\nThe Maryland General<br />\nAssembly's controversial rent<br />\ncontrol act, which limits rate<br />\nincreases to 5.1 percent<br />\nretro-active to January 11, will<br />\napply to University owned<br />\nhousing facilities in East<br />\nBalitmore and Homewood unless<br />\namended by the Baltimore City<br />\nCouncil.<br />\nCity Councilman Robert<br />\nFitzpatrick, also Homewood's<br />\nDean of Students and a veteran<br />\nadvocate of rent control<br />\negislation, said any such action<br />\nby the Council on behalf of the<br />\nUniveristy would be \"highly<br />\nunlikely.\"<br />\nThe rent control measure was<br />\none of many bills under<br />\nconsiderationd uring the Gernal<br />\nAssembly's 1973 session ending<br />\nlast Monday which came withing<br />\nth lobbying periphery of Ellery<br />\nWoodworth, President Muller's<br />\nSpecial Assistant for Legislative<br />\nAffairs.<br />\nWoodworth's most important<br />\nand time consuming activity as a<br />\nregistered lobbyist in Annapolis<br />\nthis year centered on Senate Bill<br />\n848, the aid to private graduate<br />\ninstitutions bill which authroizes<br />\n$573,000 in unconditional funds<br />\nfor Hopkins.

I let<br />\na series of ten rings die out and when the<br />\nnext series began I started to rise. It had to<br />\nbe a wrong number because my friends knew<br />\nnot to call this early. When I picked up the<br />\nphone, Mitchell didn't wait for me to say<br />\nanything. \"Something terrible has happened,\"<br />\nhe said. \"You lost your wallet again?\"<br />\n\"There's been a fire. Jimmy's dead.\"<br />\nI always thought that thirddegree burns were the worst pain.<br />\n\"It's good that he didn't have to suffer,\" I thought. But then I remembered that Neal -- who knew about<br />\nsuch things -- had told me that dolor<br />\n10 was what they called the worst<br />\npain and that it came in two packages: childbirth and something called<br />\ntic douloureux. But then who's counting?<br />\n<br />\nAlan Gelb<br />\n<br />\nSo now he'd fill a role for us<br />\nyoung artists. Now we could write poems<br />\nabout him, stories about him. One of our<br />\nkind snatched in the bloom of youth. Who'd<br />\nbe the first? Neal, Claire, me, Marty? Probably Claire, maybe me.<br />\nI'm a breakfast eater, the<br />\nonly one I know. Eggs, bacon, hot cereal,<br />\ncoffee. I make it the meal of the day. I don't<br />\nbelieve it, Claire would scream, I can't even<br />\nsee straight in the morning. Just read Addle<br />\n<br />\nSomething terrible<br />\nhas happened. I didn't want to hear<br />\nabout it. I never want to hear about<br />\nterrible things. Nothing terrible has<br />\never, happened in my life -- not a<br />\nfuneral, not a suicide, not even a<br />\ngrandfather with a kidneystone. And<br />\nyet I sit motionless in chairs a great<br />\ndeal, I scream snently among library<br />\nstacks, and I awake in the morning<br />\nwith distress of the colon.<br />\n<br />\nHe had a little sensitive Jewish raccoon face. His hands<br />\nhad slender fingers that always<br />\nplayed with his hair. I told him once<br />\nthat it was a form of masturbation<br />\nand he believed me so he stopped<br />\ndoing it in public. He could be very<br />\nstupid about such things and it<br />\ntaught me to control my mouth.<br />\n<br />\n\"Jimmy's dead.\" You're<br />\nkidding. Why do people always say \"you're<br />\nkidding\" at times like that? Not even a<br />\nmaniac would make such a joke and Mitchell's not a maniac. You're kidding, you're<br />\nkidding. Sit down and pull yourself together,<br />\nhe said to me like a Dutch uncle. Oh fuck<br />\noff, I'm sick, I said, and then I heard<br />\nmewlish sounds of reproach on the other end<br />\nof the phone.<br />\nHe only had a mother. She<br />\nworked at Social Security and now her life<br />\nwould be ruined. We'd have to take turns<br />\ngoing over for dinner when time had passed a<br />\nbit. And long evenings would be spent talking<br />\nabout him. Did she have a photograph<br />\nalbum? Yes, she had a photogriph album.<br />\n<br />\nI wish I hadn't answered the<br />\nphone. I often don't, for days even. Nobody<br />\nseems to mind much except my mother, back<br />\nhome in New York, who, when she finally<br />\ngets me on the phone, spends the entire time<br />\ntelling me how hysterical she's been. And I'm<br />\nsure she has been. As you can see, I harbor<br />\nan hysterical gene which I control quite well.<br />\nA wave of nausea<br />\nI waited at a red<br />\nas<br />\nmc<br />\novercame<br />\nlight. I choked it down twice, but on<br />\nthe third trip it won and I tried to<br />\nleave most of it in my hankerchief<br />\nbut some spilled out onto the upholstery. Never mind: it will clean out.<br />\nNo, maybe I should leave it: a memento, a souvenir. No, on third<br />\nthought, I'd better use a little Afta<br />\non it or it will stink the car up good.<br />\n<br />\nYou lost your wallet<br />\nagain. In a year or maybe six<br />\nmonths, Mitchell would be able to<br />\ntell that story to Jean, to Marty, to<br />\nClaire, and make them laugh their<br />\ncontrolled laughter and make them<br />\nshake their heads at my foolishness.<br />\nAnd then I shall hurt with pain, but<br />\nI'll take a sip of beer and yes, I'll go<br />\nalong with the joke.<br />\n<br />\nI started to shiver as<br />\nI put on my. clothes. My knees<br />\nknocked, my shoulders went into<br />\nuncontrollable rhythms. I went back<br />\nto bed and covered myself from head<br />\nto toe with a heavy wool blanket but<br />\nit did no good. And so I dressed warmly,<br />\nmuch too warmly for May, and I had to be<br />\nuncomfortable all of that long day.<br />\n<br />\nHe was good in that special<br />\ngood people can be.<br />\nperfectly<br />\nway that only<br />\nSmiling, laughing, foolishly innocent. We used<br />\nto make such fun of him but it never hurt<br />\nhis feelings because he trusted us in that special way. Cut the Billy Budd act, we'd yell at<br />\nhim, and he'd just smile. \"A smiling boy,<br />\nmuch beloved in the neighborhood,\" we'd<br />\ncackle in Yiddish accents, and he'd just smile.<br />\nSometimes it drove you insane.<br />\n<br />\n\"We were very tired,<br />\nwe were very merry. We went back<br />\nand forth all night on the ferry.\" Or<br />\nsomething like that. Claire recited it<br />\none night over Rhine wine.

(I would be happy to honk for Jesus, sir,<br />\nexcept I'm afraid lie might think I'm honking at you to get your ass moving.) It has<br />\nbecome perfectly clear that I must look to other baskets for my eggs.<br />\nWords, words, words. If there weren't words there would be no lies and then where<br />\nwould we be? \"The sky is blue.\" \"No, it's not. It's green.\" \"How do you know?\"<br />\nThat's infantile alright. Maybe the Pope can help me. I will not, however, put a coffee<br />\ncup stain on the page to avoid charges of misrepresenation, because I couldn't drink<br />\nenough cups of coffee to keep up with the distribution the manuscript deserves and<br />\nwill get, if I can find more baskets.<br />\nThree weeks have come and gone. I wonder if, during that period, the universe<br />\nturned the corner and is coming home again. I suspect not since there wasn't a jolt and<br />\neast is still east and west is still west, although America's overseas business concerns are<br />\nworking quite diligently to correct this mammoth inconsideration. (Throw rocks and<br />\nkeep Ike away and then steal Don Buford, eh? You impertinent yellow midgets. We<br />\ndidn't beat you bad enough.) No baskets in the Orient, Mr. Businessman.<br />\nDjuna and her boring brother come by to see me. I could only report three<br />\nparagraphs progress (more, more\u2014six chickens in every pot). She scolded me with her<br />\nmasculine eyes, her hands not hiding the, mustache. Needless to say, the whole affair<br />\nwent right by her brother who is not as sensitive and vulnerable. He carried a .357<br />\nMagnum in a shoulder holster which, all in all, was exceptionally nifty. He let me hold<br />\nit, not releasing the safety, but I felt like Woody Allen. (Maybe there's a place for this<br />\nmanuscript in one of those little reviews?) He was boring even though he had read The<br />\nBest and the Brightest. I'm boring even though I haven't. Djuna brought some<br />\nmarijuana. (He, Fred, thought it was spelled with an \"h\", but was otherwise very good<br />\nabout the legal transgression.) and we became silly. Fred threw up, laughing<br />\nthroughout. I wrote some notes thinking, perhaps, that in the future (will we then be<br />\ncoming home?) I could remember a few trains of thought. Djuna is much better at<br />\nthat, but I try. We listened to Hubert Laws and early Rick Nelson while he(Fred)was<br />\nthrowing up and then, inevitably, I grew dependent upon her for reassurance of the<br />\nsuccess of the ms. (Maybe I could peddle it among the workers to promote the<br />\n<br />\nEllen Carter<br />\n<br />\nongoing socialist revolution?) Djuna has switched to Chesterfields since some doubt has<br />\nbeen thrown upon the clean bill of health previously ascribed to little cigars. They<br />\naren't Marlbpros, but then neither is this manuscript. Ask the \"workers\" if they would<br />\nrather have a copy of The Sunlight Dialogues or three cartons of Marlboros, then offer<br />\nthis manuscript as a third alternative. If I put words some out of order...experimental?<br />\n(See \"Words Out of Order\" by Barry Cats, Partisan Review, Spring 1972.)<br />\nThat article could be by Pablo Neruda\u2014if we are still going out. If we are still going<br />\nout, the Surrealists and the Anarchists gave up too soon. I want verification! (In the<br />\nfuture, the tape recorder will handle the problems posed by the accassionally necessary<br />\nemployment of exclamation points and adverbs.) Who cares anyway? We're busy<br />\nproducing a generation of functional illiterates.<br />\n\"Illiterates of the world unite! (exclamation point unnecessary if spoken) Too long<br />\nhave you been oppressed, your illiterate women raped, your sacred oral traditions<br />\nplundered by the so-called \"literate\" minority. The time has come to throw down the<br />\ncloak of oppressive books and pick up pictures! (Ibid.) I say to you that extremism in<br />\nthe defense of illiteracy is no vice. Gasoline is still gasoline no matter what the name.<br />\nA house is not a home without someone there to love you. So then, my brothers, in<br />\nthe name of illiterate love, a love which knows no grammatical limitations, rise up and<br />\noverthrow your oppressor and tlien, once again, we may dance in the sun, bath in the<br />\nrain, and sing like monkeys jumping on typewriters. Up against the wall you<br />\nmotherfucker librarians!\" (Ibid.)(I later apologized for using a dirty word.)<br />\nAfter the rally, Djuna complimented me on my speech, said I had real \"balls,\"<br />\nwhatever that means. She's quite a person, though. She related to me that she had had<br />\na dream last week in which everyone was a subsistence organic farmer. She grew<br />\norganic okra while I, her neighbor, grew organic tomatoes. We'd meet occasionally to<br />\nprepare vats of organic okra gumbo. She thought that was nice, but then awakened in<br />\na cold, slightly erotic sweat when an organic mustard gas factory was erected on her<br />\nsouth forty. I held her, Caressed her hair, and pooh-poohed the dream and she was<br />\ncalmed. Then I began to think...that's so heavy and far-out. Is that where we're at,<br />\nman You know? (See \"Heavy and Far Out\" by John Lennon, Rolling Stone,<br />\nDecember 16,1972)<br />\nMeanwhile, the manuscript is not getting anywhere and there's not a basket in sight.<br />\nBut since we're in the twentieth century, we have to deal with the problem of death.<br />\nDeath is a relatively new concept, originating in the diseased minds of liberals and<br />\natheists. To be sure, we have not swept the subject under the proverbial carpet for one<br />\nhundred thousand years, but it's just that, gee whiz, since the disappearance of God<br />\n(See \"Is God Dead?\" Time, January 8,1966), the thought has become more terrifying<br />\nin the wormrot-obsessed minds of American citizens. I get very nervous about, so I<br />\nsmoke more cigarettes and drink more alcohol (no shit). It's the least I can do to prove<br />\nI'm no different.<br />\nI went to see Djuna with progress report of five more paragraphs in a week. She<br />\nsnickered and said I didn't know the first thing about plot, characterization, or<br />\nsymbolism. I told her I knew I could excise her and that was argurrtent enough. It's<br />\nfunny that, after the previous paragraph, she should mention my smoking and<br />\ndrinking. It's been bothering her.

On the Mutual Attraction of Bodies<br />\nNewton discovered gravity one autumn day while sitting in his garden. Everyone<br />\nknows that story. What most people do not know is that Leibnitz did not believe in<br />\ngravity. In his mind, Leibnitz imagined the solar system. He looked at the planets.<br />\n--Where are the strings, he asked. --How do the planets stay up there, in motion, he<br />\ninquired. --Do they love each other, Leibnitz asked. Obviously, he did not understand the nature of gravity.<br />\nNewton, who was born in 1643,abhorred old age. --I did mv best work when I<br />\nwas younger, and before senility set in, he would say. --I am an old man and can no<br />\nlonger think clearly, he would say, when he became eligible for Medicare. Isaac was a<br />\ndeeply introspective young man. The year the universities closed, he went<br />\nhome and spent many long and happy days thinking silently to himself,<br />\nand thinking aloud to others. --Think silently, lssac, his friends would<br />\noften say. In later life, he tried to keep up with his voluminous<br />\ncorrespondence. --I'd like to explain gravity to you in person, but you wouldn't understand, he wanted to write Leibnitz.<br />\n<br />\ncat, three goldfish, a dying parakeet.

Dr.<br />\nBentley believed in Divine Providence, which is<br />\nlocated in Rhode Island and every.\u2022<br />\nwhere else. Newton believed in<br />\nGod, though he had never<br />\nbeen to America. Newton also believed that Dr. Bentley did not believe what he, Newton, had said about God.<br />\nTherefore, in a letter, Newton wrote, --There<br />\nis yet another argument for a deity, which I take<br />\nto be a very strong one; but until the principles<br />\non which it is grounded are better received, I<br />\nthink it more advisable to let it sleep.<br />\n<br />\n..\u2022 ,;: \u2022<br />\n\u2022_ \u201eere<br />\n<br />\n\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022<br />\n<br />\n\u2022<br />\n<br />\n1,_\u2022200\u2018.<br />\n<br />\n;\u2018,Ifearitt<br />\n..<br />\nqb\u2022S \u2022**<br />\n<br />\n\u2022<br />\n<br />\n\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2018<br />\n<br />\n\u2022\u2022\u25a0\u2022\u2022<br />\n<br />\nor'<br />\n<br />\n\u2022ti<br />\n<br />\n\u2022<br />\n<br />\nNor-<br />\n<br />\nFrom this, it would appear that Newton was a<br />\ncautious man, but this is not so.

She had just telephoned them, saying that she had spotted their cat chasing birds in her<br />\nback yard, and insisted that they come to get him at once. She saw the children now, racing each other up<br />\nthe hill to her house, and wondered why they came along the roadway instead of through the woods that<br />\ndivided their homes.<br />\nMrs. Greenwood greeted them at the door as they arrived, pink-cheeked and<br />\nout of breath from running.<br />\n\"I'm sure he's your cat,\" she said. \"lie's right out back now, probably<br />\nhiding in the bushes. Just a minute ago he was right beneath a bird feeder hanging from<br />\nthe pine tree.\"<br />\nThe children followed her quick steps through the house and up<br />\nthe narrow staircase to her \"lookout\" in one of the rear bedrooms. Her windowseat was piled high with books about birds, several pairs of field glasses and a<br />\nfew used dishes. But she figured the clutter wouldn't matter to the children, as<br />\n!<br />\nthey seemed to be quite intrigued by her house.

Apparently she was the only one of the three who remembered Peter.<br />\nThe two boys, unconcerned with their surroundings, had already perched<br />\nthemselves on the window-seat, and appeared to be straining to catch a<br />\nglimpse of their pet. Mrs. Greenwood touched the bun of hair set on top of<br />\nher head.<br />\n\"Yes,\" she said, thinking of Peter. She was always<br />\nafraid that someone would remind her of his death, which seemed so long<br />\nago now. How long was it really? Only three years since the helicopter accident over the Arctic just after he'd joined the service. She returned their<br />\nattention to the cat.<br />\n\"I'm sure he's out there still,\" she said. \"A normal, healthy cat wouldn't just wander away from birds flying so close to the ground.\"<br />\nphoto:john rogers<br />\nThe three children watched as a cardinal landed on the ground<br />\n\"I suppose I'll<br />\nquickly,<br />\nsaid<br />\nshe<br />\nyour<br />\ncat,\"<br />\nnot<br />\nhe's<br />\nif<br />\n\"Well,<br />\nbelow the feeder.

Mitchell asked and I said I'm fine, I'm<br />\nfine, as fine as I can be.<br />\n<br />\nThe rain started so soon that<br />\nI looked heavenwards and laughed. How unsubtle, I chided, and then I shook my fists.<br />\nThe name they give it is not<br />\nso very frightening: tic douloureux, tic douloureux. Peaceful almost, soft, melodic. But<br />\nthey say when the pain comes it's like hot<br />\nneedles and your hair stands on end and tries<br />\nto climb the walls.<br />\nIf I had only known that he<br />\nknew a great deal more than I did I might<br />\nhave been able to learn something. But I<br />\ndon't listen carefully to people who speak<br />\nlow and too often the choicest words of wisdom are lost in the din of my raucous<br />\nscreaming.<br />\nThe territory had by now become familiar: stores which knew me as a<br />\ncustomer, bus stops which always had the<br />\nsame people waiting, the rowhouses of<br />\nfriends and acquaintances. So why was it that<br />\nI wove down the street like a drunkard? Because the streets had burst with open pits<br />\nand I swerved to avoid them as best I could.<br />\nWhen he came to visit me in<br />\nmy crystal lodgings, he smiled and said, Is<br />\nthis any way to live; \"I'm happy,\" I said, and<br />\nafter he had left, I climbed into the refrigerator and closed the door behind me.<br />\nIt must have been spontaneous combustion: he rubbed his hands together and fire popped out. I warned him<br />\nthat nobody could live by his rules and expect to survive, but he smiled and said he<br />\nknew what he was doing.<br />\nThe pain began to grip me. It<br />\n<br />\nUn ciego pasa y recoje una del suelo,<br />\nhilmeda, suave como una tela mojada,<br />\nel ciego se la pone an la cara;<br />\nmarchitas la cara y la hoja se pegan<br />\nbuscando calor, buscando destellos rojos.<br />\n<br />\nstarted below my eyes and traveled in an arc<br />\nto the base of my nose. I howled and<br />\nmoaned but the windows were closed and<br />\npedestrians must have thought I was singing a<br />\nsong.<br />\n<br />\nlike a white cat. The street was so quiet, so<br />\nempty of people. The wind whistled and<br />\nblew. Two nuns flew by, flapping their black<br />\nsleeves like wings. I closed my eyes a<br />\nmoment and tried to catch my breath.<br />\n<br />\nMaybe we would all dress in<br />\nblack cloaks and hoist him on our shoulders<br />\nand walk through fields of rye until we<br />\nfound a suitable place to lay him down. And<br />\nthen again, maybe we wouldn't.<br />\n<br />\nListen, I said, I've got all<br />\nthese problems. There's this and then there's<br />\nthis and this and this and this. He was patient, helpful, and kind. And I threw him out<br />\nat eight o'clock sharp because I was expecting an important message.<br />\n<br />\nHe's dead he's sick-dead he's<br />\nwithout any breath in it<br />\ncurio<br />\na godforsaken<br />\nhe's nothing at all he's dead shrunken up to<br />\nskin. But I'd wrap him around a spool and<br />\ncarry him in my pocket if I thought I<br />\nwouldn't get too many funny looks.<br />\nThe motorcycle blew up. The<br />\nfire lept out and lighted on his skin. It<br />\nthought it might find a home there but what<br />\na fool the fire was when it burned up its host<br />\nand there was nothing left for either of them<br />\nto work with.<br />\nWell, Jimmy, you had the last<br />\nlaugh. You little wise guy. You who knew so<br />\nmuch. What were you about to tell me that<br />\nlast time you called? When Kathleen tugged<br />\nat my leg and I said I'd call you back. Was it<br />\nsomething special, Jimmy? If so, why did<br />\nyou wait so goddamn long?<br />\nMy face on fire. I stagger<br />\nfall backwards against a<br />\nand<br />\ncar<br />\nfrom the<br />\nlamppost. Some disfunction of the nerve.<br />\nYou said it baby! Somehow in my sleep<br />\nsome evil spirits sneaked in and planted a<br />\nfilament in each cheek and now they pushed<br />\na button and light me up good. 0, Jesus! Do<br />\nyou hear me, Jesus, do you hear me?<br />\nThey were sitting inside waiting for me. Already a bottle of Irish whiskey<br />\nsat on the top of Claire's chiffarobe. If someone mentions Finnegans Wake, I said to<br />\nmyself, I'll retch on the floor and then I'll<br />\nstart thrashing.<br />\nThe sky became so dark, On<br />\nthe chimney of the rowhouse, the sun sat<br />\n<br />\nClaire opened the door. Behind her lavender glasses, you could see a<br />\nsprinkling of red around the lower rims. We<br />\nembraced and she took my hand. Everyone<br />\nelse had been there some time, she said, and<br />\nwhen we got near the back room I heard the<br />\ntinkling of ice cubes against glass and the<br />\nsounds of throaty laughter attacked my spine<br />\nlike a school of predatory fish.<br />\nExcuse me, won't you Claire?<br />\nI ducked into the bathcould.<br />\nI<br />\nbest<br />\nas<br />\nI said<br />\nroom and turned on the cold water tap full<br />\nforce. I cupped the icy water in my palms<br />\nand applied it to my face and for a moment<br />\nI felt relieved. But then the twitching pain<br />\nstarted again and I gripped the sink and I<br />\ntried not to look into the mirror.<br />\nJimmy, your face is as remote<br />\nto them now as a newspaper photo of an<br />\nastronaut. 'Your words have become scrabble<br />\ntiles scattered over a table top. They know<br />\nyou now as \"deceased friend.\" They'll plug<br />\nyou into some brain pocket and pull you out<br />\nwhen they need you.<br />\nThe room in which they were<br />\ngathered was dark and small. Everybody was<br />\nthere. Neal and Marty were in the corner<br />\ntalking about Ezra Pound. Jean was lying on<br />\nthe couch, covering her eyes with her hair.<br />\nMitchell looked at the record collection.<br />\n\"Hello,\" they all said, and then they flinched<br />\nat my unhappy face.<br />\ncontinued on page 10<br />\n<br />\n\fpage 2/april 1973/a collection of virorch<br />\n<br />\nTIC DOULOUREUX<br />\ncontinued from page one<br />\n<br />\nthen again, I didn't try to escape. I wish now<br />\nthat I had thought of cutting things to say<br />\nabout people who said things behind his<br />\nback. But then, he wouldn't have liked that,<br />\neven if it were in his own behalf.<br />\nThere was a fire, Mitchell<br />\nsaid. I thought first of his face in bandages,<br />\nand his arms all burnt, suspended at right<br />\nangles to his body. I whispered \"No,\" and<br />\nMitchell said, Yes, will you listen?<br />\nWhen I was young, there was<br />\na fire at Our Lady of the Angels in Chicago,<br />\nI think. Maybe St. Louis? The nuns crouched<br />\non window ledges, their black habits orange<br />\nwith flame. The faces of children trapped behind glass panes. Mothers had to identify<br />\nbodies by unburned shoes, lunch boxes soldered to tiny hands. 0, Jimmy! I'm coming<br />\nto help you!<br />\nJimmy the Mascot, someone<br />\nhad called him. I think it was Neal. Ah yes,<br />\nhe let the words slip out from behind his<br />\nbushy black mustache and then he petted<br />\nthat mustache as if it had done good work.<br />\nAh yes, it was considered a clever joke. Can<br />\nsomebody tell me: what was funny?<br />\nAnd now I remember more:<br />\nthere's a choice involved in tic douloureux.<br />\nThe pain comes in waves, days or weeks between, and you can stand at an open window<br />\nand breathe in the air and try to live with it.<br />\nOr else you can have the pain excised -- is it<br />\nthe ganglia they remove? -- but then your<br />\nface becomes slack and wrong, like after a<br />\nserious stroke. But, yes, there is indeed a<br />\nchoice.<br />\nThe funny thing is that he<br />\nwas the last person you would expect to see<br />\n<br />\nclosest ally. I owed him money for books,<br />\nbut when I opened my wallet there was<br />\nnot hing.<br />\n<br />\nAlan Gelb<br />\n<br />\non a motorcycle. A bicycle, yes: wearing an<br />\nEnglish racing cap, a picnic lunch in the<br />\nwicker basket beside him, perhaps whistling<br />\n\"Daisy.\" And so when he roared up to where<br />\nwe were all gathered one day, his face lost<br />\nwithin the white helmet on his head, we all<br />\nchoked with laughter and he laughed too, although we could see he was hurt.<br />\n\"He died last night,\" Mitchell<br />\nsaid. Last night? Last night I took a bath<br />\nwith Kathleen, we drank a bottle of wine,<br />\nshe fell asleep early, I rewrote chapter five.<br />\nHe couldn't have died last night, I would<br />\nhave felt it, messages would have come to my<br />\nmind.<br />\nCars formed a cortege behind me and they didn't even know it. I<br />\nlooked into the rear-view mirror to see the<br />\nfaces of bereaved friends but they turned out<br />\nto be busdrivers with grey caps or black<br />\nwomen in white uniforms. I opened the window to let the rain beat down on my face<br />\nand then I smoked half a cigarette.<br />\nHis talent was considered<br />\ngood if limited. Moral fables, mystical tales<br />\nthat peeled like fruit to reveal seeds of truth<br />\nat the core. Some, like Claire, like Neal,<br />\nthought they were dull sermons, \"poor man's<br />\nHesse.\" Nobody really thought he could<br />\nmake a go of it. But then he had other skills,<br />\ncarpentry and welding, and we all knew we<br />\ndidn't have to worry about him.<br />\nAnd yes, there is an ultimate<br />\ncapacity for pain. Reassuring to know, isn't<br />\nit? So at some nightmare point the body will<br />\nsay \"Just a moment, that's enough\" and<br />\nfloat itself into oblivion.<br />\n\"He died last night.\" Last<br />\nnight? And they didn't tell me until now?<br />\nAnd I, I his closest friend, and he, he my<br />\n<br />\nTwo Poems<br />\n<br />\nOn his birthday we gave him<br />\nCheese, meat, a fish course,<br />\nsupper.<br />\na fine<br />\nloaves of bread, goblets of wine. Ten or<br />\ntwelvel..iof us gathered around, wolfing down<br />\nthe fine food. I sat at his right and watched<br />\nhim: his long hair falling in his face as he<br />\nbent over to eat his food, and then, when he<br />\nstraightened up, a smile could be seen. Get<br />\nthe lights right so we can get a picture! I<br />\nhear, and I aimed the lamps at his face and I<br />\njoined arms with the group as we gathered on<br />\neither side of him.<br />\nThe sky grew darker as I<br />\nmerged onto a small parkway that fell down<br />\na steep slope. His face was a planet that hung<br />\nin the grey sky, the eyes as bright as beams,<br />\nand I covered my eyes for a moment and I<br />\nprayed. Jimmy, 0, Jimmy. The dancers are<br />\nall gone under the hill, my friend, and what<br />\nis there for those left behind?<br />\nLet us have a moment of sigether out thoughts. Let us<br />\nto<br />\nwhich<br />\nlence in<br />\nhave a moment of silence to remember important words.<br />\nI'll dig his grave if they want<br />\nme to, but can't it wait a week? My bones<br />\nare recovering from a night on the town and<br />\nmy head -- it feels like hell.<br />\nOnce he showed me the Bible<br />\nand said this is the way things should be<br />\nwritten. And I said No! Make it ugly so they<br />\ncan feel it, make it hurt so it won't go away.<br />\nHe looked at me and shook his head and<br />\nwhen I felt my face the contortions were as<br />\nfixed as locks.<br />\nAnd then Mitchell told me<br />\nthe whole story. Senseless, senseless. He was<br />\ncleaning his motorcycle with kerosene and it<br />\nall blew up on him. There was never. any .<br />\nhope.

According to 3400's<br />\nprogram of events, this year's rejuvenation is to be effected<br />\nthrough \"fond memories, fun, and entertainment:\"<br />\nWe cannot disagree wtih those who hold that nostalgia, fun and<br />\nentertainment are appropriate ways to celebrate the arrival of<br />\nspring. But a far more important arrival, that of<br />\nUniversity-community coopertaion and involvement, ahs yet to be<br />\nrealized.<br />\nLooking back on our \"fond memories,\" we may find that the<br />\nformer isolation of the University from the life and lives which<br />\nsurrounded it during the days which we now celebrate indeed still<br />\nare still with us today, rendered far more disconcerting by the<br />\ncomplexity of the modern problems facing both the community<br />\nand the University.<br /><br />\nIn other opening day action.<br /><br />\nConfromtation of urban problems, such as housing, pollution,<br />\ntransportation, and eroding educational systems, should not rest<br />\nsolely upon the shoulders of community leaders.

I therefore wanted<br />\nto take this means to let every one<br />\nof these people know how much I<br />\nappreciate their help and effort<br />\nover the years. I can honestly say<br />\nthat if it were not for the support<br />\nof all these Indians, this<br />\nabout-to-be ex-chief would not<br />\nhave lasted as long as he did.

At<br />\nthe tope of the stairs the cavern<br />\nturns ou to be the dance floor of<br />\nthe Famous Ballroom, its<br />\nemmensity obscured by the tables<br />\nfull of people on hand for The Left<br />\nBank Jazz Society's presentation<br />\nof four hours' music by<br />\noutstntanding jazz artists. The<br />\nLBJS concerts run from iive p.m.<br />\nuntil nine p.m. on virtually every<br />\nSunday of the year, and reflect the<br />\ndifferent styles and directions of<br />\ncomtemporary jazz. Within the last<br /><br />\nyear bands ranigorng from Woody<br />\nHerman's orchestra to Pharoah<br />\nSander's quintet have played The<br />\nFamous, making it unique in his<br />\nsustained ability to present superb<br />\nand widely varied talent. The<br />\naudience is invariably receptive,<br />\nbul it maintains a sense of the<br />\ncriiieal oftentimes lacking in<br />\ncurrent rock audiences.<br />\nApplause After Breaks<br />\nLast Sunday's Left Bank Jazz<br />\nSociety's production featured the<br />\nCharles Mingus Quintet, with<br />\nMingus on bass, Roy Brooks,<br />\ndrums, George Adams, tenor sax,<br />\nCharles Mcgee, trumpet, and Ron<br /><br />\nPullen, piano. The quintet was<br />\nextremely capable as a group, and<br />\nequally competent in the solo<br />\ncategory. Adams and Mcgee<br />\nconsistently dazzled the audience<br />\nwith their virtuoso horn work,<br />\nwhich ranged from the beautifully<br />\nplacid to traumatically frantic.<br />\nBrooks demonstrated incredible<br />\nability on drums, drawing applause<br />\nat the end of each of his breaks.<br />\nPullen's keyboardwork was<br />\ncompetent, but not quite' up to the<br />\nflash of the Quintet's horn section<br />\nor Brook's drumming. Mingus did<br />\nnot stnad out in terms of his solo<br />\nplaying, but his underlying<br /><br />\n3400 on stage<br /><br />\npresence was the unifying factor<br />\nabove all Mingus makes the band<br />\none f the tightest in jazz.<br />\nA Major Force<br />\nMingus has been one of the<br />\nmajor forces in jazz since the<br />\n1950's. The list of greats with<br />\nwhome he has played includes<br />\nCharlie Parker, Stan Getz, Thad<br />\nJones, Art Tantum, and Eric<br />\nDolphy. He has always been a<br />\ncontroversial figure in terms of<br />\nboth his music andh is life. Mingus'<br />\nrole ,as a musical crusader spans<br />\never twenty years of constant<br />\nwarfare with dishonest promoters,<br />\ncorrupt record companies, and<br />\nracial prejudice. He has chronicled<br />\nhis struggles in an autobiography<br /><br />\nand<br />\nhas attempted<br />\nto<br />\ncircumvent the pitfalls of the<br />\nmusic industry by forming several<br />\nmusicians cooperative labels.<br />\nMingus' music is highly, eclectic,<br />\nas evidenced by last Sunday's<br />\nconcert, which featured a range<br />\nfrom the latest trends in<br />\ninpressionistic jazz to an almost<br />\npurely traditional blues number.<br />\nAlthough he never broke through<br />\nwith the sole bass lines for which<br />\nhe is famous, his strong bass<br />\ncounterpoint to the horn section<br />\nwas overpowering. Mingus'<br />\nseething presence was the factor<br />\nthat carried the Quintet's<br />\nperformance, and made the highly<br />\ncomplex music intelligible to the<br />\nnon-initiates present.<br /><br />\nNEws-IrrirER<br /><br />\nTHI<br />\neditor-in-chief<br />\nbusiness manager<br />\ncontributing editors<br />\nday editors<br />\nmanaging editors<br />\nphotography editors<br />\nsports editor<br />\ncirculation manager<br />\nphoto-production manager<br /><br />\n'I WAS ALWAYS THANKFUL HE WASN'T A POLITICAL CARTOONIST!'<br /><br />\nGeriatric at the wheelof antique car<br />\nat last year's .7400 on stage<br /><br />\nRichard Waring<br />\nFred Slone<br />\nBill Abbott, B.H.

Noon Series on aspects of sleep<br />\nBy RICHARD BLAND<br />\n\"Sleep Onset and Hypnotic<br />\nDrugs\" was the topic of this<br />\nweek's Wednesday Noon Series,<br />\ndiscussed by Dr. Clinton Brown,<br />\nDirector of Basic Sciences<br />\nResearch at the Maryland<br />\nPsychiatric Center.<br />\nBrown, former director of<br />\nSleep Study Labs for the<br />\nDepartment of Psychiatry and<br />\nBehavioral Science from<br />\n1967-69, criticized the abuse of<br />\nsleeping aids and maintained that<br />\ntheir use is often harmful to<br />\nnormal sleeping habits.<br />\nBrown explained that a person<br />\nunder the influence of a sleeping<br />\npill \"was not asleep, but in a<br />\ndrugged state.\" He added that<br />\nsleep studies have indicated that<br />\npersons who do not use sleeping<br />\naids are \"better able to perform<br />\nthe task of being awake.\"<br />\n\"One's level of awareness can<br />\nbe reduced by sleep-inducing<br />\ndrugs,\" Brown commented.<br />\nBrown described the four<br />\nlevels of sleep that are common<br />\nto human beings.<br />\nSleep begins, he explained,<br />\nwith a latency period of<br />\napproximately 17.5 minutes for<br />\nthe average person. At this point<br />\nthe first stage of sleep,<br />\ncharacterized by rapid eyeball<br />\nmovement (REM), usually<br />\ncommences. The REM stage, as<br />\nthis first level is called, is<br />\ncommonly associated with<br />\ndreaming.<br />\nThe period of deepest sleep,<br /><br />\nN<br /><br />\naccording to Brown, is stage four.<br />\nHe noted that sleep-walking,<br />\ntooth grinding, and bed-wetting<br />\noccur in this stage.<br />\nDuring the course of a night's<br />\nsleep, people cycle back and<br />\nforth between the four stages of<br />\nsleep, and may awaken for spells<br />\nduring the night without realizing<br />\nit, he added.<br />\nBrown also indicated that lab<br />\nstudies have shown stage four to<br />\nbe the most imnortant for<br />\nmetabolic andphysiological repair.<br />\nPatients who have been<br />\ndeprived of both REM and stage<br />\nfour sleep will inevitably make<br />\nup the stage four sleep first,<br />\nwhile letting the REM sleep wait.<br />\nREM-deprived patients exhibit<br />\nconfusion and irritability,<br /><br />\nSpeaking on the subject of<br />\nsleeping hypnotics, Brown noted<br />\nthat in Great Britain, the sale of<br />\nhypnotics surpasses that of<br />\nasprin. In the United States, he<br />\nsaid, there are 87 types of<br />\nhypnotics on the market, \"with<br />\nno real difference in content.\"<br />\nAnswering questions from an<br />\naudience of approximately thirty<br />\npersons, Brown maintained that a<br />\nshot of alcohol may be a helpful<br />\ninducer of sleep, but that<br />\nalcoholism is damaging to<br />\ngenerally healthy sleeping habits.<br />\nAnother questioner asked<br />\nwhether there was any \"normal\"<br />\namount of sleep for human<br />\nbeings. Brown answered that<br />\nalthough age could be a factor,<br />\nthere was really no such thing as<br /><br />\nDr. Clinton Brown<br />\na \"normal\" amount of sleep. He<br />\npeople in their fifties who are<br />\nstated that it varied from babies<br />\ngenerally accustomed to five or<br />\nwho sleep 72% of the time to<br />\nsix hours.<br /><br />\nPre-Meds face new recommendations plan<br />\nBy MITCH TENZER<br />\nHopkins students seeking<br />\nrecommendations to medical<br />\nschools in 1974 will receive them<br />\nfrom a new Pre -Medical<br />\nRecommendations Committee,<br />\nchaired by Dr. Martin Larrabee,<br />\nBiophysics.<br />\nThe committee system<br />\nreplaces the method used in<br />\nprevious years, which required<br />\nstudents to obtain<br />\nrecommendations from faculty<br />\nmembers with whom they were<br />\nfamiliar. According to Larrabee,<br /><br />\nthe procedure lack coordination.<br />\nThe old system resulted in a<br />\n\"phony\" recommendations<br />\ncommittee of some seventy<br />\nmembers, none of whome were<br />\nparticularly instructed in the<br />\nprocedures of writing<br />\nrecommendations. \"Once a<br />\nfaculty member. had been<br />\ncontacted by a student,\" said<br />\nLarrabee, \"he automatically<br />\nbecame a member.\"<br />\nThis year the Pre-Medical<br />\nRecommendations Committee<br />\nwill consist of 24 faculty<br />\nmembers, representing various A.<br /><br />\n&amp; S. fields, including Social<br />\nSciences, Humanities, as well as<br />\nNatural Sciences.<br />\nThe chairman of the<br />\nCommittee will assign each<br />\napplicant to a Committee<br />\nmember who will be responsible<br />\nfor the preparation of the<br />\nstudent's recommendation. If a<br />\ncommittee member is already<br />\nacquainted with a student, the<br />\nstudent may request him to<br />\nprepare the recommendation.<br />\n\"We hope to overhaul the<br />\nsystem, to get it working better \u2022<br />\nby collecting more information<br /><br />\non the student and stressing<br />\nuniformity in recommendations<br />\nprocedures,'' commented<br />\nLarrabee.<br />\n\"Students may be uneasy<br />\nwith this new system, simply<br />\nbecause it is new and because the<br />\nold system did place 80 percent<br />\ninto med school,\" he<br />\ncommented.<br />\nHe asserted that the<br />\ncommittee system will protect<br />\nthe credibility of the<br />\nrecommendations so that \"we<br />\ncan get our best students into top<br />\nschools.\"<br /><br />\nL Hop-Comp<br /><br />\nDear Sirs:<br />\nW it h the rising composition costS in the printing field today,<br />\nhigh quality, attractive composition has<br />\nbeen priced out of the range of many<br />\npeople and organizations who might wish<br />\nto take advantage of this service.

Sanders<br />\ncommented that \"the magazine<br />\noverhaul is still not yet finished.<br /><br />\nIrwin heads new arts quarterly<br />\nBy A. P. SMITHWICK<br />\nA new quarterly of the arts,<br />\n\"Strivers' Row\", is to begin<br />\npublication this summer under<br />\nthe editorial and financial<br />\nauspices of Dr. John Irwin,<br />\nEnglish.<br />\nAccording to Irwin, the<br />\nmagazine will emphasize modern<br />\n\"synesthetic\" art, or that which<br />\nembodies two or more artistic<br />\ngenres.<br />\n\"An example of synesthetic<br />\nart would be a poem written in<br />\nthe shape of a sculpture,\" Irwin<br />\nsaid, continuing, \"Thus a [work<br />\nof] art will take on the<br /><br />\nachievment of another and try to<br />\nreproduce it.\".<br />\nThe, most widely-known<br />\nsynesthetic artist in the U.S.<br />\ntoday is e.e. cummings, whose<br />\npoetry achieves both audio and<br />\nfisual effect through the relative<br />\npositions of his lines, words, and<br />\npunctuation marks.<br />\nThe quarterly's board of<br />\nadvisory editors will include<br />\nnewly-appointed faculty member<br />\nand writer John Barth, Jackson<br />\nCope, a former English professor<br />\nhere, now occupying an endowed<br />\nchair at U.S.C., James Dickey,<br />\nWilliam Heyen, and other<br /><br />\nwell-known writers, critics,<br />\nmusicians, and artists.<br />\n\"We've successfully attracted<br />\nbig names to the magazine,\" said<br />\nIrwin, \"because when readers<br />\nrecognize these names they will<br />\nassume [the quarterly to be] of<br />\nhigh quality. These highly<br />\ntalented advisory editors will<br />\ncontribute and steer the efforts<br />\nof their friends.\"<br />\nContributors to the first issue<br />\nof the magazine include Joyce<br />\nCarol Oates, Mona Van Duyn,<br />\nMark<br />\nJohn Hollander,<br />\nMcClockey, and Monroe Spears.<br />\nBecause the quarterly is to be<br />\nfinanced completely by Irwin,<br />\nwithout advertixing revenues, a<br />\nspecial edition of each issue will<br />\nbe produced in order to establish<br />\na \"financial cushion\" with which<br />\nto survive the first few years of<br />\npublication.<br />\nIn reture for the $20 special<br />\nedition subscription fee, readers<br />\nwill receive manuscripts signed<br />\nby the authors, in addition to<br />\nspecially printed copies of<br />\netchings, prints, and paintings.<br /><br />\nMore ordering will have to be<br />\ndone over the summer. But by<br />\nfall, the magazine selection<br />\nshould be much better.\"<br />\nAmong The New<br />\nIn coordination with Dr.<br />\nRichard Macksey, Humanities<br />\nCenter, Sanders has introduced a<br />\nwide range of previously<br />\nand<br />\nun o ffe re d quarterlies<br />\njournals.

The Blue<br />\nJays and Cavaliers have virtually<br />\nshared the top spot in the major<br />\nlacrosse polls ever since the<br />\nseason's opening face off, but by<br />\nthe dinner hour one team will<br />\nstand alone.<br />\nPermeating the air tomorrow<br />\nwill be memories lingering from<br />\nthe last meeting of the titans,<br />\nwhen Virginia trimmed the Blue<br />\nJay feathers, 13-12, to capture<br />\nthe NCAA crown. Hopkins, solid<br />\nfavorites in that game, will seek<br />\nretaliation before the.anticipated<br />\n8000 Parents' Day spectators in<br />\nstriving to keep its unblemished<br />\n1973 record intact.<br />\nIn addition to being defending<br />\nNCAA campions, the Cavalier<br />\nsquad comes into Baltimore with<br />\ntwo consecutive Hero's<br />\nInvitational Tournament titles<br />\nunder its belt. There can be no<br />\ndoubt that Virginia is better in<br />\nevery phase of the game than any<br />\ncollege team Hopkins has faced<br />\nthis year.<br />\nThe Wahoos have a fine goalie<br />\nin Rod Rullman, a self-assured<br />\nsophomore with lightening quick<br />\nreflexes. After Virginia had<br />\nplodded halfway through a so-so<br />\nseason marked by indecision on<br />\nwhich of two freshman to use in<br />\nthe nets, Rullman earned the<br />\npost with a remarkable sequance<br />\nof goaltending. With Washington<br />\nand Lee leading 7-3 and ready to<br />\nput the game out of reach,<br />\nRullman blocked three point<br />\nblank shots within a five second<br />\nspan. This effort inspired his<br />\nteammates to a come from<br /><br />\nbehind victory which salvaged a<br />\nberth in the NCAA tourney. The<br />\nCavaliers have not lost since then<br />\nand own the longest winning<br />\nstreak among major powers.<br />\nRullman has continued his<br />\nsparkling display this season on<br />\nroute ter-unanimous selection as<br />\nthe Most Valuable Player in the<br />\nHero's Tourney. On successive<br />\ndays his presence stymied Carling<br />\nand Maryland as the Wahoos won<br />\nboth games by single goal<br />\nmargins to take the honors.<br />\nDefensively, Virginia fields an<br />\nexperienced trio composed of<br />\nsecond team All-American Bruce<br />\nMangeIs, Boo Smith, and Ed<br />\nSpencer that is the mainstay of<br />\nthe 1973 squad. MangeIs is a<br />\nsenior who has been a concensus<br />\nchoice as the premier crease<br />\ndefenseman in the country for<br />\ntwo years in a row. Smith has<br />\nalso performed well for the unit<br />\nand had one of his best games in<br />\nthe June finale last year. In that<br />\ngame he held fellow junior Jack<br />\nThomas to two goals and one<br />\nassist, giving up only one tally in<br />\nsettled situations. Spencet, now a<br />\nsophomore at Virginia, started<br />\nlast year and promises to pester<br />\nmany an attackman before he<br />\ngraduates. 4<br />\nLeading the Wahoos on attack<br />\nis senior Tom Duquette, who has<br />\nearned All-American recognition<br />\nall three years in Charlottesville.<br />\nNolonger eclipsed by Jay Connor,<br />\nwho graduated last year,<br />\nDuquette is thriving in his role as<br />\nthe cornerstone of the Cavalier<br />\noffense. Classmate Rick Bergland<br />\nis also having an excellent spring,<br />\nworking well with Duquette.<br />\nThe midfields are also strong<br />\nthreats at both ends of the field.<br />\nStandouts for Virginia include<br />\nsecond team All-American Doug<br />\nCooper and sophomore Richie<br />\nWerner. Both are crafty dodgers<br /><br />\nwho like to score and have<br />\nplayed will against Hopkins in<br />\nthe past.<br />\n\u2022 Coaclf Bob Scott looks forward<br />\nto another close contest as he<br />\nconsiders both clubs to be just<br />\nabout as strong as last year. For<br />\nrecent regular season encounters<br />\nwith the Cavaliers, 'Scott. has<br />\nunveiled surprise tactics such as<br />\nthe stall that almost upset the<br />\nvastly superior 1971 Wahoos.<br />\nAlthough he refused to admit<br />\nplanning anything special -for<br />\ntomorrow, Blue Jay fans should<br />\nnot be surprised if his sleeveful of<br />\ntricks catches Virginia off guard.<br />\nThe key to victory will be ball<br />\ncontrol and depends on having<br />\nthe Blue Jays pressure the Wahoo<br />\ndefense, so effective ground ball<br />\ncoverage is essential. A strong<br />\ndefensive effort and the<br /><br />\nLes Matthews directs Ferguson and Barbera on defense.<br />\navoidance of penalties which<br />\nhampered the June comeback<br />\nattempt will also be required.<br />\nWhatever the result, lacrosse<br /><br />\nHop thinclads place in tri-meet<br />\nBy CHUCK SLON1M<br />\nThe wintery winds of spring<br />\nstormed the ,Homewood' field<br />\nWednesday afternoon as the Blue<br />\nJay track team played host to<br />\nGettysburg and Albright<br />\nColleges. The Hopkins squad split<br />\nthe tri-meet, bowing to<br />\nGettysburg and leaving Albright<br />\nmuch behind. As the final event<br />\nfinished, the Jays saw themselves<br />\nwith 74 points, just shy of<br />\nGettysburg's 81 points and well<br />\nahead of Albright's 26.<br />\nThe meet got underway with<br />\nthe javelin, shot put, long jump,<br />\nand pole vault. Freshman Sty<br />\nDickinson vaulted 11'6\" to win<br /><br />\nthat event for the day. Although<br />\nthe second and third placers also<br />\ncleared that height, Dickinson<br />\nhad no misses making it on his<br />\nfirst try. Sophomore Jack<br />\nCoulter took fourth with an<br />\n1 1-foot vault. Meanwhile, ten<br />\nyeards behind the pole vault<br />\nrunway, junior Al Schiff,<br />\naveraging about 43 feet per<br />\nthrow, put the shot 44'21<br />\n/<br />\n2<br />\n\" on<br />\nhis sixth throw to capture first<br />\nplace in the shot put. Senior Hal<br />\nAltman brought in fourth place<br />\nwith a put of 41'91<br />\n/<br />\n2\".<br />\nDirectly beside both of these<br />\nevents, the long jump was taking<br />\nplace.

This<br />\nmatch was both the first victory<br />\nfor the team and the first<br />\nMason-Dixon Conference match<br />\nof the season. In the past week<br />\nHopkins was shut out by<br />\nDelaware, Swathmore, and Navy<br />\nas Rob Fink's single set win<br />\nagainst Delaware was the only<br />\nbright spot in the three matches.<br />\nChilling<br />\nThings were different in the<br />\nchilling temperatures on<br />\nWednesday afternoon. In fact<br /><br />\nsports<br /><br />\nBaby Jay stickers are undefeated<br />\nBy MIKE LaTAPE<br />\nThe \"B\" lacrosse team has had<br />\na busy spring. Having emerged<br />\nvictorious in the nine scrimmages<br />\nand the one game already played,<br />\nthe Baby Jays were to have taken<br />\non arch-rival Towson State's JV<br />\nsquad. But due to a unique set of<br />\ncircumstances, Coach Willie<br />\nScroggs Was unable to et the<br />\ngame played.<br />\nIn addition to being<br />\nundefeated, Hopkins has outshot<br />\nand outgroundballed every<br />\nopponent, controlled at least half<br />\nthe lace-offs in each encounter,<br />\nand has cleared the ball much<br />\nbetter than the. opposition. With<br />\nthe exception of the Calvert Hall<br />\nscrimmage, the opposing goalie<br />\nhas been called on to make more<br />\nsaves than required of the<br />\nHopkins duo of Mike Godack<br />\nand Dave Wilbur.<br />\nScrimmage victims included<br />\nEssex C.C. (11-7), Loyola High<br />\n(8-4), the University of Notre<br />\nDame's fledgling Club (7-4),<br />\nArmy Prep, (16-7), Gilman<br />\n(12-6), Calvert Hall (13-4),<br />\nArchbishop Curley (14-2), UMBC<br />\nJV (9-6), and McDonough (5-3).<br />\nIn the lone game played to<br />\ndate, HOpkins outshot Anne<br />\nArundel C.C. by a. 54-27 margin<br />\nas the Baby Jays ran away with<br />\nthe 14-6 decision.<br />\nThe game started rather<br />\ninauspiciously for the Anne<br />\nArundel goalie. Four of the first<br />\nfive Baby Jay shots went. by him<br />\ninto the net for goals. Hopkins<br />\nenjoyed a 5-2 lead after the first<br />\nquarter. At the half, the lead had<br />\nbeen upped to 9-2.<br />\nIt was all downhill from there<br />\nas Scroggs freely substituted for<br />\nhis starters. The starting attack of<br />\nPaul Botzler, John Bender, \u2022 and<br />\nLarry Leonard accounted for<br />\nthree goals and four assists before<br />\nsitting down. But the bulk of the<br />\ngoals were scored by the first<br />\nmidfield of Randy Dase, font<br />\nCirillo, and Bruce Parker who<br />\ncombined for 7 goals and two<br />\nassists.<br /><br />\nGrabbing the rest of the points<br />\nwas the second midfield of Mike<br />\nCollins, Pete Barrow, and Bill<br />\n\"Pinky\" Norbeck. Top<br />\ngroundball hogs were Cirillo,<br />\nParker, and Harry Kogelschatz.<br />\nKogelschatz and Barrow<br />\ncontrolled 14 of the 25 face-offs<br />\ncontested.<br />\nIt was a dull game after the<br />\nfirst five minutes. The Baby Jays<br />\nwere by far the superior team as<br />\nthe starting defense of Mike.,<br />\nRiley, Bruce Shapiro, and Jim<br />\nMoorhead limited Anne Arundel<br />\nto only six shots on goal through<br />\nthe first three periods. In that<br />\nsame time, Hopkins poured 26<br />\nshots on goal with countless<br />\nothers just missing.<br />\nBut much better competition<br />\nis on the offing. Next week<br /><br />\nHopkins travels to St. Paul's on<br />\nMonday and entertains Nassau<br />\nC.C. on Thursday. Following<br />\nthose contests, the Baby Jays do<br />\nbattle with the Penn Frosh,,<br />\nCommunity College of<br />\nBaltimore, and the Navy Plebes.<br />\nOne thing that may hamper<br />\nthe Baby Jays as the season<br />\nprogresses is, being a \"B\" team,<br />\none .of their duties is to prepare<br />\nthe varsity for Saturday. As<br />\nHopkins gets closer to the end of<br />\nthe season and the play-offs,<br />\nmore and more pressure may be<br />\nplaced on the \"B\" squad to ready<br />\nthe varsity.<br />\nThat, along with the fact that<br />\nthey must share the practice field<br />\nwith the varsity, may not leave<br />\nthe \"13\" team with sufficient<br />\ntime to prepare for their games.<br /><br />\nHopkins won this match in<br />\nstraight sets.

Frank Healey, Steve<br />\nErdman, Ken Leopold, Bill<br />\nBlubaugh, and Skip Miller, the<br />\nfive Blue Jays scoring for the<br />\nsquad, had final rounds of 85,<br />\n86, 87, 90, and 93 respectively.<br />\nCaptain Jay Conaty, finishing<br />\nsixth for Hopkins, tied Miller<br />\nwith a 93 on the back green.<br />\nInconsistant<br />\nCoach Win Smith felt that the<br />\nweather was most responsible for<br />\nthe team's poor showing<br />\nTuesday.

Earl Weaver can<br />\nonly wait and see what happens<br />\nwhile some fans are already<br />\nhollering for Sherlock Holmes<br />\nand Watson to investigate.<br />\nThe Orioles have some<br />\nproblems but the pitching is not<br />\nsupposed to be of primary<br />\nconcern, although some feel the<br />\nBirds lack last season's depth<br />\ncourtesy of the Earl Williams<br />\ndeal. Pat Dobson and Rorie<br />\nHarrison are hard to replace but<br />\nMcNally and Cuellar's arms<br />\nshould have at least one or two<br />\nyears left with any kind of luck.<br />\nPalmer, barring injury, may<br />\n\"only\" have another ten solid<br />\nyears remaining in his powerful<br />\nright wing. Weaver s immediate<br />\nworry will be a replacement for<br />\nDobson, with Doyle Alexander<br />\nexpected to fill the void.<br /><br />\nAlexander has a history of erratic<br />\nperformances, but being given a<br />\npermanent spot in the rotation<br />\nmight allow him to \"find<br />\nhimselr' as a hurler.<br />\nThe vaunted Oriole defense<br />\nremains intact despite a loss in<br />\ndepth now that Johnson is gone.<br />\nThe result of this deal is that<br />\nBelanger will regain his starting<br />\nrole at shortstop and Grich's<br />\npermanent home will be second<br />\nbase. With Robinson at third and<br />\ndespite a mediocre Powell at<br />\nfirst, the Orioles have probably<br />\nthe best defensive infield in<br />\nbaseball.<br />\nBaseball experts have always<br />\nmaintained that championship<br />\nball clubs must be strong \"up the<br />\nmiddle.\" Having Mark Belanger<br />\nand Bobby Grich in the infield<br />\nand Paul Blair patrolling center<br />\nfield, the Orioles would seem to<br />\nbe in 'clover. Alongside Blair in<br />\ncenter, Don Baylor will start in<br />\nleft .field and Mery Rettenmund<br />\nwill cover right field. The<br />\nquestion mark lies behind the<br /><br />\nplate where heavy hitting Earl<br />\nWilliams brings a reputation of<br />\nsporadic fielding.<br />\nThe initial concern remains<br /><br />\nhitting with the only new<br />\naddition to the Oriole lineup<br />\nbeing Earl Williams. Fans should<br />\nnot get the wrong idea about the<br />\nformer Braves star. He is not<br />\nanother Frank Robinson and no<br />\none should expect him to be.<br />\nRobinson averaged 30 home<br />\nruns, 100 runs batted in, 100<br />\nruns scored, and a .300 batting<br />\naverage annually, not to mention<br />\nhis sensational fielding,<br />\nbaserunning and leadership.<br />\nWilliams has never been a .300<br />\nhitter, .nor a great fielder but he<br />\nhas power. If fan pressure lets up,<br />\nhe's capable of prod.\u2022ing<br />\nsomewhere around 40 home runs<br />\nin a season. There aren't many<br />\nFrank Robinsons around and the<br />\nOrioles did not acquire a new<br />\none. Instead they have a long ball<br />\nthreat backed up. by an entire<br />\nteam that is coming of an<br />\nuncharacteristically bad year at the<br />\nplate. It is unlikely they will<br />\nrepeat that feat.

One of our<br />\nkind snatched in the bloom of youth. Who'd<br />\nbe the first? Neal, Claire, me, Marty? Probably Claire, maybe me.<br />\nI'm a breakfast eater, the<br />\nonly one I know. Eggs, bacon, hot cereal,<br />\ncoffee. I make it the meal of the day. I don't<br />\nbelieve it, Claire would scream, I can't even<br />\nsee straight in the morning. Just read Addle<br /><br />\nSomething terrible<br />\nhas happened. I didn't want to hear<br />\nabout it. I never want to hear about<br />\nterrible things. Nothing terrible has<br />\never, happened in my life -- not a<br />\nfuneral, not a suicide, not even a<br />\ngrandfather with a kidneystone. And<br />\nyet I sit motionless in chairs a great<br />\ndeal, I scream snently among library<br />\nstacks, and I awake in the morning<br />\nwith distress of the colon.<br /><br />\nHe had a little sensitive Jewish raccoon face. His hands<br />\nhad slender fingers that always<br />\nplayed with his hair. I told him once<br />\nthat it was a form of masturbation<br />\nand he believed me so he stopped<br />\ndoing it in public. He could be very<br />\nstupid about such things and it<br />\ntaught me to control my mouth.<br /><br />\n\"Jimmy's dead.\" You're<br />\nkidding. Why do people always say \"you're<br />\nkidding\" at times like that? Not even a<br />\nmaniac would make such a joke and Mitchell's not a maniac. You're kidding, you're<br />\nkidding. Sit down and pull yourself together,<br />\nhe said to me like a Dutch uncle. Oh fuck<br />\noff, I'm sick, I said, and then I heard<br />\nmewlish sounds of reproach on the other end<br />\nof the phone.<br />\nHe only had a mother. She<br />\nworked at Social Security and now her life<br />\nwould be ruined. We'd have to take turns<br />\ngoing over for dinner when time had passed a<br />\nbit. And long evenings would be spent talking<br />\nabout him. Did she have a photograph<br />\nalbum? Yes, she had a photogriph album.<br /><br />\nI wish I hadn't answered the<br />\nphone. I often don't, for days even. Nobody<br />\nseems to mind much except my mother, back<br />\nhome in New York, who, when she finally<br />\ngets me on the phone, spends the entire time<br />\ntelling me how hysterical she's been. And I'm<br />\nsure she has been. As you can see, I harbor<br />\nan hysterical gene which I control quite well.<br />\nA wave of nausea<br />\nI waited at a red<br />\nas<br />\nmc<br />\novercame<br />\nlight. I choked it down twice, but on<br />\nthe third trip it won and I tried to<br />\nleave most of it in my hankerchief<br />\nbut some spilled out onto the upholstery. Never mind: it will clean out.<br />\nNo, maybe I should leave it: a memento, a souvenir. No, on third<br />\nthought, I'd better use a little Afta<br />\non it or it will stink the car up good.<br /><br />\nYou lost your wallet<br />\nagain. In a year or maybe six<br />\nmonths, Mitchell would be able to<br />\ntell that story to Jean, to Marty, to<br />\nClaire, and make them laugh their<br />\ncontrolled laughter and make them<br />\nshake their heads at my foolishness.<br />\nAnd then I shall hurt with pain, but<br />\nI'll take a sip of beer and yes, I'll go<br />\nalong with the joke.<br /><br />\nI started to shiver as<br />\nI put on my. clothes. My knees<br />\nknocked, my shoulders went into<br />\nuncontrollable rhythms. I went back<br />\nto bed and covered myself from head<br />\nto toe with a heavy wool blanket but<br />\nit did no good. And so I dressed warmly,<br />\nmuch too warmly for May, and I had to be<br />\nuncomfortable all of that long day.<br /><br />\nHe was good in that special<br />\ngood people can be.<br />\nperfectly<br />\nway that only<br />\nSmiling, laughing, foolishly innocent. We used<br />\nto make such fun of him but it never hurt<br />\nhis feelings because he trusted us in that special way. Cut the Billy Budd act, we'd yell at<br />\nhim, and he'd just smile. \"A smiling boy,<br />\nmuch beloved in the neighborhood,\" we'd<br />\ncackle in Yiddish accents, and he'd just smile.<br />\nSometimes it drove you insane.<br /><br />\n\"We were very tired,<br />\nwe were very merry. We went back<br />\nand forth all night on the ferry.\" Or<br />\nsomething like that. Claire recited it<br />\none night over Rhine wine. She<br />\nwears lavender-blue glasses, Claire<br />\ndoes, and recites Millay, Claire does.<br />\nIn 1972! And we don't even laugh.<br />\nDolar 10. The worst<br />\npain.

I had to miss it that<br />\npain suffered will cause the mother to rip the<br />\nmorning. I'm not complaining, I'm not being<br />\nchild apart. But worse than an ember held in<br />\ncallous. I wouldn't even have been able to<br />\nhand? Worse than burning kerosene<br />\nthe<br />\nlook at it, but I knew it would make matters<br />\ncrawling up a shirtfront?<br />\nworse.<br />\n0, Jimmy, we hardly knew<br />\nsome Irish poem? I pull<br />\nfrom<br />\nthat<br />\nIsn't<br />\nye.<br />\nmy car out of the driveway and I say those<br />\nwords again and again. Goddamn Irish bullshit, so stupid, so perfect. I wish I knew<br />\nmore so I could make an ass out of myself to<br />\nthe rear-view mirror.<br />\nNow I remember: tic douloureux, painful tic, a form of facial neuralgia<br />\nvictims to suicide. They have<br />\nthat has<br />\ninto the sinuses or somealcohol<br />\nto shoot<br />\nthing like that. You can imagine how painful<br />\nit is, Neal told me, if a doctor, of all people,<br />\nterms it douloureux. But worse than skin<br />\nburnt off and muscle laid bare? 0, Jimmy,<br />\nwe hardly knew ye.<br /><br />\nHumor is a funny thing. I<br />\nthink that's the tag end of a joke.

I departed, the disgruntled doctor declining<br />\nto rise.<br />\nI realize now how heavily I have come to depend upon Djuna for the projected<br />\nanthological success of (or failing that, critical acclaim for) my manuscript. Too<br />\nmany eggs in her basket\u2014an unwise, unconscious abdication, although her<br />\nencouragement has been a necessary impetus. (I would be happy to honk for Jesus, sir,<br />\nexcept I'm afraid lie might think I'm honking at you to get your ass moving.) It has<br />\nbecome perfectly clear that I must look to other baskets for my eggs.<br />\nWords, words, words. If there weren't words there would be no lies and then where<br />\nwould we be? \"The sky is blue.\" \"No, it's not. It's green.\" \"How do you know?\"<br />\nThat's infantile alright. Maybe the Pope can help me. I will not, however, put a coffee<br />\ncup stain on the page to avoid charges of misrepresenation, because I couldn't drink<br />\nenough cups of coffee to keep up with the distribution the manuscript deserves and<br />\nwill get, if I can find more baskets.<br />\nThree weeks have come and gone. I wonder if, during that period, the universe<br />\nturned the corner and is coming home again. I suspect not since there wasn't a jolt and<br />\neast is still east and west is still west, although America's overseas business concerns are<br />\nworking quite diligently to correct this mammoth inconsideration. (Throw rocks and<br />\nkeep Ike away and then steal Don Buford, eh? You impertinent yellow midgets. We<br />\ndidn't beat you bad enough.) No baskets in the Orient, Mr. Businessman.<br />\nDjuna and her boring brother come by to see me. I could only report three<br />\nparagraphs progress (more, more\u2014six chickens in every pot). She scolded me with her<br />\nmasculine eyes, her hands not hiding the, mustache. Needless to say, the whole affair<br />\nwent right by her brother who is not as sensitive and vulnerable. He carried a .357<br />\nMagnum in a shoulder holster which, all in all, was exceptionally nifty. He let me hold<br />\nit, not releasing the safety, but I felt like Woody Allen. (Maybe there's a place for this<br />\nmanuscript in one of those little reviews?) He was boring even though he had read The<br />\nBest and the Brightest. I'm boring even though I haven't. Djuna brought some<br />\nmarijuana. (He, Fred, thought it was spelled with an \"h\", but was otherwise very good<br />\nabout the legal transgression.) and we became silly. Fred threw up, laughing<br />\nthroughout. I wrote some notes thinking, perhaps, that in the future (will we then be<br />\ncoming home?) I could remember a few trains of thought. Djuna is much better at<br />\nthat, but I try. We listened to Hubert Laws and early Rick Nelson while he(Fred)was<br />\nthrowing up and then, inevitably, I grew dependent upon her for reassurance of the<br />\nsuccess of the ms. (Maybe I could peddle it among the workers to promote the<br /><br />\nEllen Carter<br /><br />\nongoing socialist revolution?) Djuna has switched to Chesterfields since some doubt has<br />\nbeen thrown upon the clean bill of health previously ascribed to little cigars. They<br />\naren't Marlbpros, but then neither is this manuscript. Ask the \"workers\" if they would<br />\nrather have a copy of The Sunlight Dialogues or three cartons of Marlboros, then offer<br />\nthis manuscript as a third alternative. If I put words some out of order...experimental?<br />\n(See \"Words Out of Order\" by Barry Cats, Partisan Review, Spring 1972.)<br />\nThat article could be by Pablo Neruda\u2014if we are still going out. If we are still going<br />\nout, the Surrealists and the Anarchists gave up too soon. I want verification! (In the<br />\nfuture, the tape recorder will handle the problems posed by the accassionally necessary<br />\nemployment of exclamation points and adverbs.) Who cares anyway? We're busy<br />\nproducing a generation of functional illiterates.<br />\n\"Illiterates of the world unite! (exclamation point unnecessary if spoken) Too long<br />\nhave you been oppressed, your illiterate women raped, your sacred oral traditions<br />\nplundered by the so-called \"literate\" minority. The time has come to throw down the<br />\ncloak of oppressive books and pick up pictures! (Ibid.) I say to you that extremism in<br />\nthe defense of illiteracy is no vice. Gasoline is still gasoline no matter what the name.<br />\nA house is not a home without someone there to love you. So then, my brothers, in<br />\nthe name of illiterate love, a love which knows no grammatical limitations, rise up and<br />\noverthrow your oppressor and tlien, once again, we may dance in the sun, bath in the<br />\nrain, and sing like monkeys jumping on typewriters. Up against the wall you<br />\nmotherfucker librarians!\" (Ibid.)(I later apologized for using a dirty word.)<br />\nAfter the rally, Djuna complimented me on my speech, said I had real \"balls,\"<br />\nwhatever that means. She's quite a person, though. She related to me that she had had<br />\na dream last week in which everyone was a subsistence organic farmer. She grew<br />\norganic okra while I, her neighbor, grew organic tomatoes. We'd meet occasionally to<br />\nprepare vats of organic okra gumbo. She thought that was nice, but then awakened in<br />\na cold, slightly erotic sweat when an organic mustard gas factory was erected on her<br />\nsouth forty. I held her, Caressed her hair, and pooh-poohed the dream and she was<br />\ncalmed. Then I began to think...that's so heavy and far-out. Is that where we're at,<br />\nman You know? (See \"Heavy and Far Out\" by John Lennon, Rolling Stone,<br />\nDecember 16,1972)<br />\nMeanwhile, the manuscript is not getting anywhere and there's not a basket in sight.<br />\nBut since we're in the twentieth century, we have to deal with the problem of death.<br />\nDeath is a relatively new concept, originating in the diseased minds of liberals and<br />\natheists.

I get very nervous about, so I<br />\nsmoke more cigarettes and drink more alcohol (no shit). It's the least I can do to prove<br />\nI'm no different.<br />\nI went to see Djuna with progress report of five more paragraphs in a week. She<br />\nsnickered and said I didn't know the first thing about plot, characterization, or<br />\nsymbolism. I told her I knew I could excise her and that was argurrtent enough. It's<br />\nfunny that, after the previous paragraph, she should mention my smoking and<br />\ndrinking. It's been bothering her. She gave me a reefer.<br />\nIs it enough to rain upon a cigarette floating in a urinal? Or perhaps I should fish it<br />\nout, knowing all the while that the filter, following the inevitable degeneration of the<br />\nremainder, may clog the plumbing? I don't have the stomach (or \"balls\"?) to stick my<br />\nhand in the yellow poison, I decide,anyway. There are persons trained and paid to<br />\nperform this function. They are technicians. Honor is sludge.<br />\nThe ROTC general came to see me about the possibility of employing several<br />\nquotes from my rally speech in their new, revised recruiting campaign. I declined<br />\nbecause of Djuna's brother, Fred. I didn't tell him that. I told him that I knew<br />\nsomeone who was going to know John Barth within a reasonable space.liedidn't<br />\nunderstand when I said I had to wait.<br /><br />\na collection of words/april 1973/page 7<br /><br />\nI Came Here<br /><br />\nWhat could we say?<br />\nMimi Bilzor<br /><br />\nThis is the high G that breaks the glass<br /><br />\nPaul Grosswiler<br /><br />\nChris Mason<br /><br />\nKnow<br /><br />\nLeft-over dreams don't go away<br />\nLonely things come<br />\nTo watch rays of the evening sun<br />\nBurnt-up candles and antique ?naps<br />\nBroken ships on mother-of-pearl<br />\nIt'e came.<br />\nPlace<br />\nWe go by place<br />\nAngry sounds left long ago<br />\nThe wagon trail fades<br />\nTulip and maple, honeysuckle and creeping cedar<br />\nAnd miniature - meadow hushes<br />\nAre why we came<br />\nTime<br />\nWe are this place<br />\nThere is pain --- but not here<br />\nNot here because here there is a southern pine<br />\nThat catches the wind for a moment<br />\nAnd shares it with all of us<br />\nWhere we stay<br /><br />\nIn another place<br />\nWe feel there is something<br />\nWe wonder and we know<br />\nRain on rotting leaves<br />\nEarth crosses Moon<br />\nAnd still we are here<br />\nWe will always be here<br /><br />\nWhat could we say to them<br />\nStanding at the corner<br />\nPuffing out our chests<br />\nSlamming our fists together?<br />\nOur T\u2014shirts stretched<br />\nAt the necks<br />\nWe had no weapons<br />\nWe had not come to fight<br />\nThe best of us could only<br />\nDo 20 push-ups.<br />\nTheir pimpled faces jumped at us<br />\nTheir shiny black jackets had<br />\nLittle Zippe red pockets<br />\nUp and down the sides<br />\nTheir shiny black hair<br />\nCurled up and twisted<br />\nForward and shot back<br />\nAcross their temples.<br />\nWe'd said it before,<br />\nI remembered, as the old pharmacist<br />\nIn the drugstore beside us<br />\ndropped the pills he had measured<br />\nWhen he saw the knives.<br />\nThe brass funnel made no sound.<br />\nWe'd said we were tougher than shit<br />\nAnd punched at our shoulders and laughed.<br /><br />\nAny one of us<br />\ncan be lodged in the belly of a whale and live.<br />\nWe have all trembled<br />\nlike a frog beneath a flashlight,<br />\nwhile the fog rolls away<br />\ntaking all our posse'sSi6ns-,'1'<br />\nThough our shoefare \"seldOrn'tied:;;I:n1<br />\nwe can walk fine.'<br /><br />\nAnd yet a simple tone of voice,<br />\nthe way someone talks,<br />\nthough straight from the throat and stomach,<br />\ncan crack<br />\nthe two-b'4ours'inside thy mind.<br />\nSome smells,<br />\nrubbed upon your skin,<br />\nwill drive you away from your home.<br />\nIt is possible<br />\nto wriggle out of the whale's mouth<br />\nand shake the hands<br />\nof the fishermen on the shore.<br />\nBut this is the scrape<br />\nof chalk against the blackboard.<br />\nIt sits in your fingers and quivers.<br />\nIt drives you away from the village.<br /><br />\nI remembered as I ran<br />\nOur sneakers could not carry us<br />\nFast enough.<br /><br />\nMr. Burke's Funeral<br /><br />\nThree Poems<br />\nRecipe: Dream Punch<br /><br />\nJohn Owen<br /><br />\nDigestion<br />\nDevouring me in the darkness<br />\nMy bed has grown accustomed<br />\nTo feeling me in its stomach<br />\nWaiting longer each morning \u2014 Regurgitation.<br />\nSoon I will settle well with the others.<br /><br />\nFill tub with hot water.<br />\nGently step' in -- relax,<br />\nCount the tiles on the wall<br />\nAs you grow accustomed to the water.<br />\nReach for the razor that lies nearby<br />\nAnd slash the wrist,<br />\nSo that the blood rushes fast<br />\nAnd hard in great spurts.<br />\nImmerse the head in that amniotic fluid<br />\nAnd breathe deeply of it.<br />\nRest quietly on the bottom<br />\nAnd Dream.<br /><br />\nAn Alternative Cure For Waiting<br />\nBob Mergehenn<br />\nconsider adapting the manuscript for the stage, set to music.

What most people do not know is that Leibnitz did not believe in<br />\ngravity. In his mind, Leibnitz imagined the solar system. He looked at the planets.<br />\n--Where are the strings, he asked. --How do the planets stay up there, in motion, he<br />\ninquired. --Do they love each other, Leibnitz asked. Obviously, he did not understand the nature of gravity.<br />\nNewton, who was born in 1643,abhorred old age. --I did mv best work when I<br />\nwas younger, and before senility set in, he would say. --I am an old man and can no<br />\nlonger think clearly, he would say, when he became eligible for Medicare. Isaac was a<br />\ndeeply introspective young man. The year the universities closed, he went<br />\nhome and spent many long and happy days thinking silently to himself,<br />\nand thinking aloud to others. --Think silently, lssac, his friends would<br />\noften say. In later life, he tried to keep up with his voluminous<br />\ncorrespondence. --I'd like to explain gravity to you in person, but you wouldn't understand, he wanted to write Leibnitz.<br /><br />\ncat, three goldfish, a dying parakeet.

She had just telephoned them, saying that she had spotted their cat chasing birds in her<br />\nback yard, and insisted that they come to get him at once.

Mrs. Greenwood touched the bun of hair set on top of<br />\nher head.<br />\n\"Yes,\" she said, thinking of Peter. She was always<br />\nafraid that someone would remind her of his death, which seemed so long<br />\nago now. How long was it really? Only three years since the helicopter accident over the Arctic just after he'd joined the service.

The nuns crouched<br />\non window ledges, their black habits orange<br />\nwith flame. The faces of children trapped behind glass panes. Mothers had to identify<br />\nbodies by unburned shoes, lunch boxes soldered to tiny hands. 0, Jimmy! I'm coming<br />\nto help you!<br />\nJimmy the Mascot, someone<br />\nhad called him. I think it was Neal. Ah yes,<br />\nhe let the words slip out from behind his<br />\nbushy black mustache and then he petted<br />\nthat mustache as if it had done good work.<br />\nAh yes, it was considered a clever joke. Can<br />\nsomebody tell me: what was funny?<br />\nAnd now I remember more:<br />\nthere's a choice involved in tic douloureux.<br />\nThe pain comes in waves, days or weeks between, and you can stand at an open window<br />\nand breathe in the air and try to live with it.<br />\nOr else you can have the pain excised -- is it<br />\nthe ganglia they remove? -- but then your<br />\nface becomes slack and wrong, like after a<br />\nserious stroke. But, yes, there is indeed a<br />\nchoice.<br />\nThe funny thing is that he<br />\nwas the last person you would expect to see<br /><br />\nclosest ally. I owed him money for books,<br />\nbut when I opened my wallet there was<br />\nnot hing.<br /><br />\nAlan Gelb<br /><br />\non a motorcycle. A bicycle, yes: wearing an<br />\nEnglish racing cap, a picnic lunch in the<br />\nwicker basket beside him, perhaps whistling<br />\n\"Daisy.\" And so when he roared up to where<br />\nwe were all gathered one day, his face lost<br />\nwithin the white helmet on his head, we all<br />\nchoked with laughter and he laughed too, although we could see he was hurt.<br />\n\"He died last night,\" Mitchell<br />\nsaid. Last night? Last night I took a bath<br />\nwith Kathleen, we drank a bottle of wine,<br />\nshe fell asleep early, I rewrote chapter five.<br />\nHe couldn't have died last night, I would<br />\nhave felt it, messages would have come to my<br />\nmind.<br />\nCars formed a cortege behind me and they didn't even know it. I<br />\nlooked into the rear-view mirror to see the<br />\nfaces of bereaved friends but they turned out<br />\nto be busdrivers with grey caps or black<br />\nwomen in white uniforms. I opened the window to let the rain beat down on my face<br />\nand then I smoked half a cigarette.<br />\nHis talent was considered<br />\ngood if limited. Moral fables, mystical tales<br />\nthat peeled like fruit to reveal seeds of truth<br />\nat the core. Some, like Claire, like Neal,<br />\nthought they were dull sermons, \"poor man's<br />\nHesse.\" Nobody really thought he could<br />\nmake a go of it. But then he had other skills,<br />\ncarpentry and welding, and we all knew we<br />\ndidn't have to worry about him.<br />\nAnd yes, there is an ultimate<br />\ncapacity for pain. Reassuring to know, isn't<br />\nit? So at some nightmare point the body will<br />\nsay \"Just a moment, that's enough\" and<br />\nfloat itself into oblivion.<br />\n\"He died last night.\" Last<br />\nnight? And they didn't tell me until now?<br />\nAnd I, I his closest friend, and he, he my<br /><br />\nTwo Poems<br /><br />\nOn his birthday we gave him<br />\nCheese, meat, a fish course,<br />\nsupper.<br />\na fine<br />\nloaves of bread, goblets of wine. Ten or<br />\ntwelvel..iof us gathered around, wolfing down<br />\nthe fine food. I sat at his right and watched<br />\nhim: his long hair falling in his face as he<br />\nbent over to eat his food, and then, when he<br />\nstraightened up, a smile could be seen. Get<br />\nthe lights right so we can get a picture! I<br />\nhear, and I aimed the lamps at his face and I<br />\njoined arms with the group as we gathered on<br />\neither side of him.<br />\nThe sky grew darker as I<br />\nmerged onto a small parkway that fell down<br />\na steep slope. His face was a planet that hung<br />\nin the grey sky, the eyes as bright as beams,<br />\nand I covered my eyes for a moment and I<br />\nprayed. Jimmy, 0, Jimmy. The dancers are<br />\nall gone under the hill, my friend, and what<br />\nis there for those left behind?<br />\nLet us have a moment of sigether out thoughts. Let us<br />\nto<br />\nwhich<br />\nlence in<br />\nhave a moment of silence to remember important words.<br />\nI'll dig his grave if they want<br />\nme to, but can't it wait a week? My bones<br />\nare recovering from a night on the town and<br />\nmy head -- it feels like hell.<br />\nOnce he showed me the Bible<br />\nand said this is the way things should be<br />\nwritten. And I said No! Make it ugly so they<br />\ncan feel it, make it hurt so it won't go away.<br />\nHe looked at me and shook his head and<br />\nwhen I felt my face the contortions were as<br />\nfixed as locks.<br />\nAnd then Mitchell told me<br />\nthe whole story. Senseless, senseless. He was<br />\ncleaning his motorcycle with kerosene and it<br />\nall blew up on him. There was never. any .<br />\nhope. His features fell from his face like fruit<br />\nshaken from the bough of a tree.
