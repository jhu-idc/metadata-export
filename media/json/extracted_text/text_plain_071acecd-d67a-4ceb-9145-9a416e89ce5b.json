Here the godless undergraduate was discussed by his teachers from the poin of<br />\nview of the change in his religious attitude.<br />\nAs we might have suspected, the most intelligent opinion was<br />\nexpressed by President Enoch B. Garey of St. Johns, who said, \"I<br />\nquestion whether a religion born 2,000 years ago in Asia is necessarily the last word for today.\" Dr. Garey, moreover, was, according to dispatches from the daily press, more inclined than any of<br />\nhis colleagues to credit the undergraduate with having a more or<br />\nless satisfactory basis for his apparent scepticism. Dean Sperry<br />\nof the Harvard Divinity School believes that the reason why<br />\nreligion apparently has so little influence on college students is that<br />\nstudents are an unthinking, gullible lot who have merely shifted<br />\ntheir credulity from the Sunday-school teacher to the biology<br />\nprofessor. Between these two extremes were other views, but<br />\nthe leaning was toward the belief that undergraduates are preeminently irreligious.<br />\nThe fact of the matter is, however, that most college students<br />\nare really agnostic; they don't know. Those who give any thought<br />\nat all to religion realize that the sheer impotency of man is evidence of the existence of some greater power, to which he applies<br />\nthe name God. But few students conceive of any definite tangible'<br />\nrelationship between God and themselves. Moreover, they are<br />\ninclined to be intellectually lazy; they accept the surface values<br />\nof life without caring about its other possibilities. In addition,<br />\nthe average student, being young and untouched by great emotional<br />\nupheavals, does not find the necessity for faith. Is it any wonder,<br />\nthen, that when the forms of religion do not appeal to the student,<br />\nwhen there seems to be so many descrepancies between what<br />\nreligion teaches him and what he finds in the world around him,<br />\nand when his life apparently is sufficiently full without religion,<br />\nthat religion exerts little or no influence upon him?<br />\nWe full well realize that we utter the grossest kind of platitude<br />\nwhen we say that college students do not think. This fact does<br />\nnot indicate, however, that they are necessarily gullible. The<br />\nreason for the general irreligious attitude of undergraduates, and<br />\nfor that of much of the world as a whole, for that matter, will be<br />\nmore likely, ultimately, to be found in Dr. Garey's statement than<br />\nin Dean Sperry's.<br />\n<br />\nHome Concert Seats<br />\nSelling Rapidly<br />\nFull House Expected to Greet Glee<br />\nClub at Maryland Casualty<br />\nClubhouse, Friday<br />\n<br />\nAll seats at the Maryland Casualty Clubhouse will probably be filled<br />\nFriday night for the Johns Hopkins Musical Club concert, according to Ostnar P.

Here the godless undergraduate was discussed by his teachers from the poin of<br />\nview of the change in his religious attitude.<br />\nAs we might have suspected, the most intelligent opinion was<br />\nexpressed by President Enoch B. Garey of St. Johns, who said, \"I<br />\nquestion whether a religion born 2,000 years ago in Asia is necessarily the last word for today.\" Dr. Garey, moreover, was, according to dispatches from the daily press, more inclined than any of<br />\nhis colleagues to credit the undergraduate with having a more or<br />\nless satisfactory basis for his apparent scepticism. Dean Sperry<br />\nof the Harvard Divinity School believes that the reason why<br />\nreligion apparently has so little influence on college students is that<br />\nstudents are an unthinking, gullible lot who have merely shifted<br />\ntheir credulity from the Sunday-school teacher to the biology<br />\nprofessor. Between these two extremes were other views, but<br />\nthe leaning was toward the belief that undergraduates are preeminently irreligious.<br />\nThe fact of the matter is, however, that most college students<br />\nare really agnostic; they don't know. Those who give any thought<br />\nat all to religion realize that the sheer impotency of man is evidence of the existence of some greater power, to which he applies<br />\nthe name God. But few students conceive of any definite tangible'<br />\nrelationship between God and themselves. Moreover, they are<br />\ninclined to be intellectually lazy; they accept the surface values<br />\nof life without caring about its other possibilities. In addition,<br />\nthe average student, being young and untouched by great emotional<br />\nupheavals, does not find the necessity for faith. Is it any wonder,<br />\nthen, that when the forms of religion do not appeal to the student,<br />\nwhen there seems to be so many descrepancies between what<br />\nreligion teaches him and what he finds in the world around him,<br />\nand when his life apparently is sufficiently full without religion,<br />\nthat religion exerts little or no influence upon him?<br />\nWe full well realize that we utter the grossest kind of platitude<br />\nwhen we say that college students do not think. This fact does<br />\nnot indicate, however, that they are necessarily gullible. The<br />\nreason for the general irreligious attitude of undergraduates, and<br />\nfor that of much of the world as a whole, for that matter, will be<br />\nmore likely, ultimately, to be found in Dr. Garey's statement than<br />\nin Dean Sperry's.<br /><br />\nHome Concert Seats<br />\nSelling Rapidly<br />\nFull House Expected to Greet Glee<br />\nClub at Maryland Casualty<br />\nClubhouse, Friday<br /><br />\nAll seats at the Maryland Casualty Clubhouse will probably be filled<br />\nFriday night for the Johns Hopkins Musical Club concert, according to Ostnar P.
