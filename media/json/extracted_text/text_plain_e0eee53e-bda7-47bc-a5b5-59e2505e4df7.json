D. CONSIDINE<br />\nThis is the third in a series of<br />\narticles on Rapid Transit in<br />\nBaltimore.<br />\nRapid Transit, like most issues<br />\nin Baltimore, does not appear to<br />\nbe much of an issue at all. Yet,<br />\nunder a seemingly dreary ebb and<br />\nflow of press releases and news<br />\nconferences lies some of the most<br />\nlively wheeling and dealing in<br />\ndomestic politics.<br />\nOnce a community concern,<br />\nBaltimore's Rapid Transit System<br />\n(RTS) has become an only<br />\noccaisional concern for the<br />\naverage citizen. The initial<br />\nground-breaking last October<br />\ncaused little more than a yawn,<br />\nand the ensuing snail's pace of<br />\nconstruction has caused most<br />\nBaltimoreans to believe that an<br />\nRTS will never come to be\u2014and<br />\nthey are very probably right.<br />\nState support of the RTS<br />\nproject has almost dropped out<br />\nentirely. In addition to the<br />\npreviously reported suggestions<br />\nfrom Governor Marvin Mandel<br />\nthat the state will refuse to<br />\nsupport RTS if it is a losing<br />\nventure, Lt. Gov. Blair Lee has<br />\nannounced that the strain of RTS<br />\nconstruction will force a freeze<br />\non all highway construction in<br />\nthe state.<br />\n<br />\nIt has since been rumored that<br />\nthe Maryland Highway<br />\nContractor's Association is<br />\nplanning to obtain a court<br />\ninjunction to prevent<br />\nconstruction of the RTS, in<br />\nresponse to Lee's statement.<br />\nLee's motives, however, might<br />\nwell be worth analysis. By<br />\nannouncing the impending<br />\nstoppage of all highway<br />\nconstruction, Lee has presented a<br />\npossible starvation of an entire<br />\nindustry. To compound the issue,<br />\nit has been pointed out that there.<br />\nare no qualified tunnel<br />\ncontractors in the area, which<br />\nmeans that RTS will deprive<br />\nsome Marylanders of their<br />\nlivelihood, and take their dollars<br />\nout of state.<br />\nThe other effect of the Lt.<br />\nGovernor's apparent ploy will be<br />\nto create regional support for<br />\nhimself.<br />\nBy announcing a possible<br />\ntermination of highway<br />\nconstruction, the areas he most<br />\nstrongly affects are the outer<br />\nreaches of the state, especially<br />\nWestern Maryland. Furthermore,<br />\nsince RTS would be of no value<br />\nto outer Maryland, a factionalism<br />\nalready felt between Baltimore<br />\nCity and the extreme reaches of<br />\nthe state would be exacerbated.<br />\n<br />\nThe motives behind Lee's<br />\nactions come more clearly into<br />\nfocus when one looks at the<br />\ngubernatorial situation in<br />\nMaryland. As Lt. Gov., Lee is<br />\nnext in line, should the Governor<br />\nbe forced to resign. Inasmuch as<br />\nthe Governor is currently under<br />\ninvestigation by a federal<br />\ncorruption probe (which earlier<br />\nin its ancestry had nabbed<br />\nCounty Executive Dale Anderson<br />\nand former Vice President Spiro<br />\n<br />\nAgnew), it is little wonder that<br />\nLee is looking ahead.<br />\nEven without the aspect of<br />\nMandel's indictment or<br />\nconviction, there is the<br />\nconsideration that Mandel may<br />\nrun for the Senate, which leaves<br />\nLee in a position to run for<br />\nGovernor.<br />\nPolitical machinations aside,<br />\nprospects for RTS still seem dim.<br />\nPublic opinion, ambivalent at<br />\nbest, seems set in the notion that<br />\n<br />\nSimon wins frosh presidency<br />\nBy LAINY STEPHANS<br />\nAnne Simon won the freshman<br />\nclass presidency in an election<br />\nwhich brought over half the class<br />\nof 1979 to the polls last week.<br />\nSimon captured 159 votes to<br />\napponent Bob Meirowitz's 102.<br />\nJeff Feinstein, who received<br />\n85 votes and Cindy Simon, who<br />\ncaptured 99 will vie for the vice<br />\npresidency of the class in<br />\nrunn-off voting this Wednesday,<br />\nThursday, and Friday.<br />\nWanda Olson ran unopposed<br />\nfor the office of freshman class<br />\nsecretary.<br />\nBarry Altman won the race for<br />\ntreasurer of the class of 1979<br />\n<br />\nwith 158 votes, defeating Harold<br />\nPotischman who received 87<br />\nvotes.<br />\nOf the 16 candidates who ran<br />\nfor the three positions as Student<br />\nCouncil representatives, six will<br />\nvie in run-offs later this<br />\nweek\u2014Timothy C.

Comparisons<br />\nwere made by category (dairy,<br />\nmeat or produce) of the food<br />\nitems.<br />\nThe survey was taken by a task<br />\nforce of thirteen students.. Each<br />\nstore was surveyed each Friday<br />\nafternoon for four weeks. At the<br />\nend of the four weeks, the results<br />\nwere tabulated. Chairing the task<br />\nforce was Bill Foster, head of<br />\nconsumer activities for the<br />\nHopkins chapter of, MARYpirg.<br />\n\"Two years ago, when this<br />\nsurvey was first run, the results<br />\nproved how one can save money<br />\nby comparison shopping. This is<br />\na futile conclusion, for one<br />\ncannot expect people to go<br />\nshopping at six different stores<br />\neach week.<br />\n\"What we are trying to do this<br />\ntime is to make the student<br />\naware of the fact that he may be<br />\nable to save money by shopping<br />\ndifferent stores on subsequent<br />\nweeks. By taking some time out,<br />\nand checking for sales, and then<br />\nrelating those items on sale to<br />\ntheir needs, the student can save<br />\nmoney.<br />\n<br />\n\"Eddie's, for example, may be<br />\nthe most convenient place to<br />\nshop for many people, but in<br />\nmost instances one can save<br />\nmoney by walking a few extra<br />\nblocks, and going elsewhere. In<br />\nthis way, one can save money in<br />\na reasonable fashion.<br />\nA follow-up to this survey is<br />\nplanned in the future by<br />\nMARYpirg, probably in the<br />\nspringtime.<br />\nThe dairy list surveyed<br />\nincluded four items: milk,<br />\nAmerican Cheese (Kraft), eggs<br />\nand butter (Land-O-Lakes). Over<br />\nthe four weeks of the survey<br />\n(Sept. 19 to Oct. 10) the sum<br />\ntotal price ranges for these items<br />\nwas as follows: Eddie's (St. Paul)$3 .8 0 to $4; Eddie's<br />\n(Greenmount)-$3.80 to $4;<br />\nGiant-$3.86 to $4.01; Pantry<br />\nPride-$3.65 to $3.81; A&P-$3.75<br />\nto $3.81 and Acme $3.71 to<br />\n$3.75.<br />\nAccording to the Baltimore<br />\nRetail Food Price Report, the<br />\naverage price range for these<br />\nsame four items in Baltimore for<br />\nthese same four weeks was $3.51<br />\nto $3.87. In all six stores there<br />\nwas a significant rise in butter<br />\nprices during the four week span.<br />\nAlso, Eddie's milk prices were<br />\nhigher than those of ether stores<br />\nbecause Eddie's has no store<br />\nbrand items\u2014a factor which<br />\ncaused many of their items to be<br />\nhigher in the survey.<br />\nUsing store brand cheeses and<br />\nbutter at other stores, one could<br />\nsave up to 20 cents in a week. In<br />\naddition, according to this same<br />\nsurvey done in the Spring of<br />\n1974, these same items now cost<br />\nmore by: 2 cents-Eddie's (both),<br />\n23 cents-Giant, 13 cents-Pantry<br />\nPride, 20 cents-A&P, and 14<br />\ncents-Acme.

But,<br />\nregrettably, they have a big one to face\u2014the ever-escalating<br />\nindirect cost recovery rate imposed by the University<br />\nadministration on all outside monies raised by faculty<br />\nresearchers.<br />\nDetermined in conjunction with federal HEW officers, this<br />\nrate continues to grow at a rate greater than inflation, a trend<br />\nwhich threatens to hamper, if not stifle entirely, sponsored<br />\nresearch.<br />\nThree years ago, the rate was fixed at 34 per cent; thence<br />\nit was raised to 38 per cent, and last year to 48 per cent.<br />\nSponsored Research officials here predict that the rate will<br />\njump to 52 per cent next year, so that more than one third of<br />\nthe money raised by Hopkins' faculty will be 'ultimately<br />\nreturned to the University to cover \"indirect costs.\"<br />\nThe effect of this continuing escalation in the recovery<br />\nrate has been\u2014and will continue to be\u2014to demoralize faculty<br />\nfund-raisers, who find ever more of their hard-earned<br />\nsponsorship being appropriated by the administration. The<br />\nannual hikes have been especially devastating to researchers<br />\nworking on long-term projects, who have found that the rate<br />\nhas increased far beyond what it was when they first<br />\nrequested research sponsorship and delineated the goals of<br />\ntheir projects.<br />\nFaculty in this position have found it necessary to cut<br />\nback on staff salaries to make ends meet or cut back on the<br />\ngoals of their projects, a regrettable result. Some researchers<br />\nhave been forced to devote more vacation, research, and<br />\nteaching time to fund-raising, in the hope that the problem of<br />\nthe escalating recovery rate can be circumvented if ever larger<br />\nsponsorships are acquired.<br />\nCuriously, this problem is one of the least publicized<br />\nexamples of economic concerns impacting adversely on an<br />\nacademic pursuit. The University administration apparently<br />\nfeels that it should avoid problems in negotiations which<br />\ninvolve the government, as do the the Sponsored Research<br />\narbitrations. To tamper in such decisions would be to risk<br />\nlosing federal support.<br />\nThough Hopkins does not have to fear losing faculty to<br />\nother schools\u2014since the recovery rate is uniformly high at<br />\nprivate universities\u2014iC does have to face the fact that the<br />\nquality of research here and elsewhere may deteriorate due to<br />\na trend which the federal government and private universities<br />\nwould do well to offset.<br />\n<br />\nCampaign Act still has problems<br />\nBy STEVE SCHULTZ<br />\n\"Experience should teach us<br />\nto be most on our guard to<br />\nprotect<br />\nliberty when the<br />\nGovernment's purposes are<br />\nbeneficent. Men born to freedom<br />\nare naturally alert to repel<br />\ninvasion of their liberty by<br />\nevil-minded rulers. The greatest<br />\ndangers to liberty lurk in<br />\ninsidious encroachment by men<br />\nof zeal, well-meaning but without<br />\nunderstanding.\"<br />\nIt is well worth pondering<br />\nthese words of our great Supreme<br />\nCourt Justice Louis D. Brandeis<br />\nin light of the developing<br />\npost-Watergate mentality. In its<br />\nwake, a rash of \"reform\" bills<br />\nhave been stampeded through<br />\nlocal, state, and national<br />\nlegislatures in what resembles a<br />\nmodern day throwback to<br />\nancient purification rites.<br />\nWith bi-partisan support, both<br />\nhouses of Congress had no<br />\ndifficulty in passing the new<br />\nFederal Election Campaign Act<br />\nof 1974 (FECA). Proponents<br />\nargue that such legislation is<br />\nnecessary in order to sever the<br />\nties which exist between big<br />\nmoney and politics and, to the<br />\nrout out the corruption which is<br />\nso pervasive in high governmental<br />\npositions.<br />\nWhile such liberal sponsors as<br />\nRep. Morriss Udall (D-Arizona)<br />\nclaim that the FECA will cleanse<br />\nthe political process, they ignore<br />\nsome serious constitutional<br />\nquestions that are raised. Such<br />\ncriticism cannot simply be<br />\nwritten off as academic<br />\nnit-picking, for many sections of<br />\nthis statute do represent a<br />\nsubstantial threat to the civil<br />\nliberties of millions of American<br />\ncitizens.<br />\nFirst, FECA places a limitation<br />\non the amount of money that<br />\ncandidates for federal office may<br />\nspend to communicate with the<br />\nelectorate. In effect, this<br />\namounts to an abridgement of<br />\nthe First Amendment right to<br />\nfreedom of expression. Such a<br />\nrestriction on expenditures in<br />\ncampaigns has led many critics to<br />\nrelabel this new federal law,\"The<br />\nIncumbent Protection Act,\" for<br />\nidentical spending ceilings are put<br />\non the challenger as well as the<br />\nincumbent. (It must be pointed<br />\n<br />\nout that the majority of the<br />\nchallengers who were able to<br />\ndefeat incumbents in the 1972<br />\nand 1974 congressional races did<br />\nso by spending more than this<br />\nnew law would allow.) Especially<br />\nhurt will be political dissidents<br />\nwhose views do not normally<br />\nreceive press exposure.<br />\nSecond, this bill restricts the<br />\namount of money that one<br />\nperson can contribute to political<br />\ncandidates ($1,000). However,<br />\n<br />\nFECA is filled with loopholes to<br />\nmaintain the privileged influence<br />\nof special interests. Wealthy<br />\ncontributors can still dictate to<br />\nelected officials through the<br />\nformation of \"voluntary\"<br />\npolitical funds.<br />\nThird, all candidates and<br />\npolitical committees are required<br />\nto keep a \"detailed account\" of<br />\neach contributor's \"full name<br />\nand the full address of his<br />\nprincipal place of residence.\"<br />\nThese records are available for<br />\ngovernment inspection at any<br />\ntime. The effect of this provision,<br />\nthen, is to erode the right of<br />\nprivacy. By mandating disclosure<br />\nof small contributors who cannot<br />\npossibly purchase campaign<br />\ncommitments, the law will deter<br />\nmany from active participation in<br />\nthe political process. It will<br />\nessentially legalize past<br />\ngovernment programs of<br />\nharassment against leftist<br />\npolitical groups and give added<br />\nimpetus to future disruptive<br />\ncampaigns. Those with radical or<br />\n<br />\nunpopular stands will think twice<br />\nbefore adding their names to yet<br />\nanother dossier.<br />\nFourth, FECA gives public<br />\nfunding to candidates and parties<br />\nfor Presidential primaries,<br />\nconventions, and the general<br />\nelection. The \"catch,\" though, is<br />\nthat only the Democrats and<br />\nRepublicans would receive such<br />\nfunding. A spokesman for the<br />\n\"public-interest\" group Common<br />\nCause neatly summed up what<br />\nwould be the law's effect: \"There<br />\nis nothing in the Constitution<br />\nthat says you cannot by law<br />\nfocus the energies of the nation<br />\ninto two major political parties.\"<br />\nThe FECA effectively screens out<br />\nminor parties, while giving<br />\nwelfare handouts to the two<br />\nmajor parties.<br />\nTo be vehemently opposed to<br />\nsuch reformist shams does not<br />\nmean that one is against true<br />\nreforms. However, this bill<br />\nmaintains the \"status quo\" while<br />\nfronting as a liberal \"reform.\"<br />\nOpposition to FECA is unique, in<br />\nthat the political boundaries<br />\nwhich normally define right and<br />\nleft evaporate, being no longer<br />\nrelevant to the issue. In fact, it<br />\nwas an odd couple indeed who<br />\nled an unsuccessful challenge in<br />\nthe U.S. Court of Appeals in<br />\nWashington\u2014former Minnesota<br />\nSenator Eugene McCarthy and<br />\nNew York's Senator James<br />\nBuckley\u2014and are now taking<br />\ntheir appeal to the Supreme<br />\nCourt. Natural allies in many<br />\npolitical battles, Common Cause<br />\nand The American Civil Liberties<br />\nUnion have taken diametrically<br />\nopposed stands on the issue, with<br />\nthe latter calling the law a serious<br />\nthreat to constitutional rights.<br />\nIf, as a result of the Watergate<br />\naffair, we are to clamp down on<br />\npolitical diversity and stifle free<br />\nexpression, then we have learned<br />\nprecious little about the workings<br />\nof a pluralist democracy.<br />\nWell-intentioned reformers have<br />\nas their goal nothing less than to<br />\nrestore American government to<br />\nits people.

The<br />\nperformances of Hal Holbrook as<br />\nMark Twain and James Whitmore<br />\nas Harry Truman have been two<br />\nof the most distinguished<br />\ntheatrical displays in the last<br />\ndecade and have brought .wide<br />\nacclaim to this previously<br />\nunheralded form. More than<br />\nanything else these\u2022 one-man<br />\nShows have been characterizations, deriving their strength<br />\nfrom warmth and personality of<br />\nthe men portrayed.<br />\nEmlyn Williams, a<br />\ndistinguished British playwright<br />\nand actor, brought a different<br />\nsort of one-man show to the<br />\nHopkins campus Sunday. Those<br />\nwho went to see Williams<br />\nexpecting a re-creation of the<br />\nman who \"never wrote a book<br />\nthat didn't sell' were<br />\ndisappointed.\"Emlyn Williams as<br />\nCharles Dickens\" was a<br />\nre-creation of the readings done<br />\non tour by Charles Dickens in<br />\n1853, and not an attempt to<br />\nrecapture the essence of the man.<br />\nWilliams said his<br />\ncharacterization of Dickens on<br />\nthe stage comes not from<br />\nresearch into the man but simply<br />\nfrom his impressions of Dickens<br />\nthrough his novels. \"If I were<br />\nDickens that's how I'd have done<br />\nthe readings.\"William's purpose in<br />\nhis performance was clear. His<br />\nPrimary intent was simply to<br />\nentertain his audience, not to be<br />\nDickens for an evening.<br />\nWhich is not to say that<br />\nmerely entertaining an audience<br />\nis bad. That was Dickens'<br />\nforemost purpose in writing, so<br />\nperhaps the most honest tribute<br />\nWilliams could have paid the<br />\nauthor was to put on the most<br />\nentertaining show he possibly<br />\nCould. Nevertheless, while<br />\nWilliams's performance was,<br />\n\"Triumphant. A uniquely rich<br />\nperformance,\" in the words of<br />\n<br />\none critic, it lacked the depth<br />\nand balance of a Dickens novel.<br />\nFor only recently has the world<br />\nof literary criticism<br />\nacknowledged the presence of<br />\nthese qualities in Dickens.<br />\nResemblance<br />\nWilliams, who in his make-up<br />\nbears a remarkable resemblance<br />\nto pictures of Dickens, admitted<br />\nafter the show Sunday that he<br />\ndoes direct his efforts in the<br />\nshow towards the wit of Dickens'<br />\nnovels at the expense of the<br />\npathos and sentimentality in<br />\nthem. \"I don't emphasize the<br />\nsentimental because today that<br />\nwould be cloying,\" he remarked.<br />\n<br />\nThe selections given Sunday<br />\nfor the most part poked fun at<br />\n19th Century England's high<br />\nsociety and bourgeois, which are<br />\ninteresting as historical<br />\ncounterpoints but which are alien<br />\nand irrelevant to both the<br />\nbackround and humor of the<br />\nAmerican audience of the 1970's<br />\nSentimentality<br />\nI think Williams was wrong in<br />\nhis assessment of audiences<br />\ntoday. There is still a place for<br />\nsentimentality in the American<br />\nTheatre. The witty, satirical<br />\ndescription and dialogue in<br />\nDickens provides the texture of<br />\nthe novels. Sentimentality,<br />\n<br />\nRomanticism, and to some<br />\nextent, tragedy, lie at the core of<br />\nmany of Dickens's novels, and it<br />\nis on this basis that I take<br />\nexception with Williams's<br />\nperformance. Williams, in<br />\nattempting to convey the sense<br />\nof the man from his writings,<br />\nfailed to do so, for he neglected<br />\nto make the audience aware of<br />\nwhat lay at the heart of Dickens's<br />\nliterary endeavors\u2014a<br />\nromantically sentimental view of<br />\nthe human condition.<br />\nBalance<br />\nThere was not enough of the<br />\nemotion and romantic idealism in<br />\nthe performance to give the work<br />\n<br />\nbalance. There were not enough<br />\npowerful lines such as the closing<br />\nof A Tale of Two Cities: \"It is a<br />\nfar, far better thing that I do,<br />\nthan I have ever done; it is a far,<br />\nfar better rest that I go to than I<br />\nhave ever known.\" Williams, in<br />\nhis desire to please his audience,<br />\ngave a less than satisfying<br />\nperformance. His selection of<br />\nreadings did not adequately<br />\nreflect both sides of the man or<br />\nhis writing. It was certainly not<br />\nWilliams's performance that was<br />\nlacking, but rather the idea that a<br />\nre-creation of Dickens's tour<br />\nalone could yield a thoroughly<br />\nsuccessful dramatic presentation.<br />\n<br />\nThe rains keep a'comin',the magic,whither has it fled?<br />\nBy RUSS SMITH<br />\nMaybe we've been spoiled, but<br />\nthe World Series isn't supposed<br />\nto be up for grabs this late in<br />\nOctober. Strange rains are<br />\nflooding Boston, along with the<br />\nwinds and unseasonably cold<br />\nweather that are usually reserved<br />\nfor the most crucial football<br />\ngames. After three consecutive<br />\nrainouts and a dubious forecast<br />\nfor today's contest, it wouldn't<br />\nbe too bold to say that things are<br />\ngetting just a little eerie up in<br />\nFenway Park.<br />\nAfter all, the Series should<br />\nhave been decided last Sunday.<br />\nWhen Cincinnati won the fifth<br />\ngame last Thursday at Riverfront<br />\nStadium, the plan for the<br />\nremainder of the Series seemed<br />\nsealed. The Red Soxwould march<br />\nback to Fenway, in the enviable<br />\nunderdog position, and with the<br />\naid of 35,000 screaming and<br />\nbottle-throwing Bosox rooters,<br />\nwould rout the Reds in the final<br />\ntwo games, taking their first<br />\nSeries since the days of Black<br />\nSox scandal.<br />\nThe Red Sox couldn't miss in<br />\n<br />\n'75.

D. CONSIDINE<br />\nThis is the third in a series of<br />\narticles on Rapid Transit in<br />\nBaltimore.<br />\nRapid Transit, like most issues<br />\nin Baltimore, does not appear to<br />\nbe much of an issue at all. Yet,<br />\nunder a seemingly dreary ebb and<br />\nflow of press releases and news<br />\nconferences lies some of the most<br />\nlively wheeling and dealing in<br />\ndomestic politics.<br />\nOnce a community concern,<br />\nBaltimore's Rapid Transit System<br />\n(RTS) has become an only<br />\noccaisional concern for the<br />\naverage citizen. The initial<br />\nground-breaking last October<br />\ncaused little more than a yawn,<br />\nand the ensuing snail's pace of<br />\nconstruction has caused most<br />\nBaltimoreans to believe that an<br />\nRTS will never come to be\u2014and<br />\nthey are very probably right.<br />\nState support of the RTS<br />\nproject has almost dropped out<br />\nentirely. In addition to the<br />\npreviously reported suggestions<br />\nfrom Governor Marvin Mandel<br />\nthat the state will refuse to<br />\nsupport RTS if it is a losing<br />\nventure, Lt. Gov. Blair Lee has<br />\nannounced that the strain of RTS<br />\nconstruction will force a freeze<br />\non all highway construction in<br />\nthe state.<br /><br />\nIt has since been rumored that<br />\nthe Maryland Highway<br />\nContractor's Association is<br />\nplanning to obtain a court<br />\ninjunction to prevent<br />\nconstruction of the RTS, in<br />\nresponse to Lee's statement.<br />\nLee's motives, however, might<br />\nwell be worth analysis. By<br />\nannouncing the impending<br />\nstoppage of all highway<br />\nconstruction, Lee has presented a<br />\npossible starvation of an entire<br />\nindustry. To compound the issue,<br />\nit has been pointed out that there.<br />\nare no qualified tunnel<br />\ncontractors in the area, which<br />\nmeans that RTS will deprive<br />\nsome Marylanders of their<br />\nlivelihood, and take their dollars<br />\nout of state.<br />\nThe other effect of the Lt.<br />\nGovernor's apparent ploy will be<br />\nto create regional support for<br />\nhimself.<br />\nBy announcing a possible<br />\ntermination of highway<br />\nconstruction, the areas he most<br />\nstrongly affects are the outer<br />\nreaches of the state, especially<br />\nWestern Maryland. Furthermore,<br />\nsince RTS would be of no value<br />\nto outer Maryland, a factionalism<br />\nalready felt between Baltimore<br />\nCity and the extreme reaches of<br />\nthe state would be exacerbated.<br /><br />\nThe motives behind Lee's<br />\nactions come more clearly into<br />\nfocus when one looks at the<br />\ngubernatorial situation in<br />\nMaryland. As Lt. Gov., Lee is<br />\nnext in line, should the Governor<br />\nbe forced to resign. Inasmuch as<br />\nthe Governor is currently under<br />\ninvestigation by a federal<br />\ncorruption probe (which earlier<br />\nin its ancestry had nabbed<br />\nCounty Executive Dale Anderson<br />\nand former Vice President Spiro<br /><br />\nAgnew), it is little wonder that<br />\nLee is looking ahead.<br />\nEven without the aspect of<br />\nMandel's indictment or<br />\nconviction, there is the<br />\nconsideration that Mandel may<br />\nrun for the Senate, which leaves<br />\nLee in a position to run for<br />\nGovernor.<br />\nPolitical machinations aside,<br />\nprospects for RTS still seem dim.<br />\nPublic opinion, ambivalent at<br />\nbest, seems set in the notion that<br /><br />\nSimon wins frosh presidency<br />\nBy LAINY STEPHANS<br />\nAnne Simon won the freshman<br />\nclass presidency in an election<br />\nwhich brought over half the class<br />\nof 1979 to the polls last week.<br />\nSimon captured 159 votes to<br />\napponent Bob Meirowitz's 102.<br />\nJeff Feinstein, who received<br />\n85 votes and Cindy Simon, who<br />\ncaptured 99 will vie for the vice<br />\npresidency of the class in<br />\nrunn-off voting this Wednesday,<br />\nThursday, and Friday.<br />\nWanda Olson ran unopposed<br />\nfor the office of freshman class<br />\nsecretary.<br />\nBarry Altman won the race for<br />\ntreasurer of the class of 1979<br /><br />\nwith 158 votes, defeating Harold<br />\nPotischman who received 87<br />\nvotes.<br />\nOf the 16 candidates who ran<br />\nfor the three positions as Student<br />\nCouncil representatives, six will<br />\nvie in run-offs later this<br />\nweek\u2014Timothy C. Hutchens,<br />\nNancy Loeb, Paul Molina, Eric<br />\nSchwartz, Lian Schwartz, and<br />\nLeonard Shaver.<br />\nThe new freshman class<br />\npresident said she was \"excited<br />\nabout working on the Council.<br />\nEveryone seems so active in<br />\ncampus affairs.\"<br />\nShe said she considers unifying<br />\nthe class to be the main problem<br />\nfacing the new freshman officers.<br />\n\"The class has to become close<br />\nnow, because after this year we<br />\nwon't necessarily be living on<br />\ncampus anymore. If we're not<br />\nfriends by the time we move out<br />\ncents more than it is now, on the<br />\nof the dorms, we'll never be.\"<br />\naverage.<br />\nThe earth and planetary<br />\nMeat<br />\nsciences major said that<br />\nThe following were the meat organizing social programs will be<br />\nitems used in the survey: ground<br />\none way of bringing the class<br />\nbeef-regular, sirloin steak, pork together.<br />\nchops-center cut, chicken-whole<br />\n\"We're also going to make<br />\nfryers and franks housing one of our major<br />\n(Esskay-skinless) all in 1 lb concerns.

Of these items, the get involved with the University's<br />\nprice ranges were: Eddie's-$7.81<br />\npurchase of more student<br />\nto $8.61; Eddie's-$7.65 to $7.75; housing and to coordinate all the<br />\nGiant-$6.37 to $7.75; Pantry on-campus and off-campus<br />\nPride-$6.77 to $7.53; A&amp;P-$6.25<br />\nhousing offices so all students<br />\nto $7.41; Acme-$6.61 to $7.81; will know what options are open<br />\nand the average Baltimore City<br />\nto them,\" Simon said.<br />\nprice range-$5.85 to $7.79. Meat<br />\nShe said she was surprised that<br />\nprices fluctuate from day to day so few freshman voted. \"I hope<br />\nbecause of sales.<br />\nmore people are interested in the<br /><br />\nMaryPIRG rates six area stores<br />\nBy ERIC SCHWARTZ<br />\nThe recent results of a<br />\nMaryland Public Interest<br />\nResearch Group (MARYpirg)<br />\ncomparative supermarket survey<br />\nof six area stores shows that the<br />\ntwo Eddie's(Greenmount and St.<br />\nPaul Sts.) charge the highest<br />\nprices for the 57-item sample.<br />\nAcme supermarket<br />\n(downtown-Eager St.) is the least<br />\nexpensive according to the<br />\nsurvey.<br />\nThe survey, conducted by<br />\nHopkins MARYpirg volunteers,<br />\nwas also taken at Pantry Pride<br />\n(28th and Greenmount Ave.)<br />\nA&amp;P (Greenmount and 33rd),<br />\nand Giant (the Rotunda<br />\nShopping Center). Comparisons<br />\nwere made by category (dairy,<br />\nmeat or produce) of the food<br />\nitems.<br />\nThe survey was taken by a task<br />\nforce of thirteen students.. Each<br />\nstore was surveyed each Friday<br />\nafternoon for four weeks. At the<br />\nend of the four weeks, the results<br />\nwere tabulated. Chairing the task<br />\nforce was Bill Foster, head of<br />\nconsumer activities for the<br />\nHopkins chapter of, MARYpirg.<br />\n\"Two years ago, when this<br />\nsurvey was first run, the results<br />\nproved how one can save money<br />\nby comparison shopping. This is<br />\na futile conclusion, for one<br />\ncannot expect people to go<br />\nshopping at six different stores<br />\neach week.<br />\n\"What we are trying to do this<br />\ntime is to make the student<br />\naware of the fact that he may be<br />\nable to save money by shopping<br />\ndifferent stores on subsequent<br />\nweeks. By taking some time out,<br />\nand checking for sales, and then<br />\nrelating those items on sale to<br />\ntheir needs, the student can save<br />\nmoney.<br /><br />\n\"Eddie's, for example, may be<br />\nthe most convenient place to<br />\nshop for many people, but in<br />\nmost instances one can save<br />\nmoney by walking a few extra<br />\nblocks, and going elsewhere. In<br />\nthis way, one can save money in<br />\na reasonable fashion.<br />\nA follow-up to this survey is<br />\nplanned in the future by<br />\nMARYpirg, probably in the<br />\nspringtime.<br />\nThe dairy list surveyed<br />\nincluded four items: milk,<br />\nAmerican Cheese (Kraft), eggs<br />\nand butter (Land-O-Lakes). Over<br />\nthe four weeks of the survey<br />\n(Sept. 19 to Oct. 10) the sum<br />\ntotal price ranges for these items<br />\nwas as follows: Eddie's (St. Paul)$3 .8 0 to $4; Eddie's<br />\n(Greenmount)-$3.80 to $4;<br />\nGiant-$3.86 to $4.01; Pantry<br />\nPride-$3.65 to $3.81; A&amp;P-$3.75<br />\nto $3.81 and Acme $3.71 to<br />\n$3.75.<br />\nAccording to the Baltimore<br />\nRetail Food Price Report, the<br />\naverage price range for these<br />\nsame four items in Baltimore for<br />\nthese same four weeks was $3.51<br />\nto $3.87. In all six stores there<br />\nwas a significant rise in butter<br />\nprices during the four week span.<br />\nAlso, Eddie's milk prices were<br />\nhigher than those of ether stores<br />\nbecause Eddie's has no store<br />\nbrand items\u2014a factor which<br />\ncaused many of their items to be<br />\nhigher in the survey.<br />\nUsing store brand cheeses and<br />\nbutter at other stores, one could<br />\nsave up to 20 cents in a week. In<br />\naddition, according to this same<br />\nsurvey done in the Spring of<br />\n1974, these same items now cost<br />\nmore by: 2 cents-Eddie's (both),<br />\n23 cents-Giant, 13 cents-Pantry<br />\nPride, 20 cents-A&amp;P, and 14<br />\ncents-Acme. Milk was then 10<br /><br />\nan RTS is needed, but really<br />\nshould not be built. The prospect<br />\nof inner-city minority groups<br />\nhaving easy access to the suburbs<br />\ndoes not please some<br />\nsuburbanites, and the amount of<br />\nmoney involved is none too<br />\nappealing to taxpayers.<br />\nThus it may be that Rapid<br />\nTransit. like prohibition and<br />\nhonor codes, is something that is<br />\ndesirable in theory, but not in<br />\npractice.<br /><br />\nAnne Simon<br />\nrun-offs, but I think the lack of a<br />\nbig turn-out is due to a lack of<br />\nadequate exposure to the<br />\ncandidates.\"<br />\nPam Chevers, Student Council<br />\nElections Committee chairman,<br />\nexpressed mixed satisfaction with<br />\nthe voter turnout.<br />\n\"I guess we got a pretty good<br />\nturnout\u2014we got over half the<br />\nclass\u2014but I had hoped there<br />\nwould be more,\" Chevers said. \"I<br />\nthink less people voted because<br />\nthey didn't know enough about<br />\nthe candidates.\"<br />\nThe candidates held an<br />\ninformal forum Tuesday evening<br />\nin the Dorm Social Lounge where<br />\nstudents were invited to ask<br />\nquestions on campus issues.<br />\nChevers said approximately 75<br />\nstudents attended the discussion.<br /><br />\nCommuters work themselves in<br />\nBy STEVEN EADDY<br />\n\"The implementation of a<br />\ncommuter lounge and Commuter<br />\nCommittee has done wonders to<br />\nincrease resident students'<br />\nawareness of commuting<br />\nstudents,\" asserted Alan Fink,<br />\nco-chairman of the newly<br />\norganized Commuter Committee.<br />\nThe Commuter Committee<br />\nand the lounge are just two of<br />\nthe major initiatives by a group<br />\nof commuter students here to<br />\nfurther integrate the non-resident<br />\nstudent into campus life.<br />\n\"In the past, there was no real<br />\nmovement by University officials<br />\nto accept the commuters as a<br />\nviable part of campus structure,\"<br />\nsays Monroe Zeffert, a freshman<br />\nmember of the Commuter<br />\nCommittee.

The<br />\nannual hikes have been especially devastating to researchers<br />\nworking on long-term projects, who have found that the rate<br />\nhas increased far beyond what it was when they first<br />\nrequested research sponsorship and delineated the goals of<br />\ntheir projects.<br />\nFaculty in this position have found it necessary to cut<br />\nback on staff salaries to make ends meet or cut back on the<br />\ngoals of their projects, a regrettable result. Some researchers<br />\nhave been forced to devote more vacation, research, and<br />\nteaching time to fund-raising, in the hope that the problem of<br />\nthe escalating recovery rate can be circumvented if ever larger<br />\nsponsorships are acquired.<br />\nCuriously, this problem is one of the least publicized<br />\nexamples of economic concerns impacting adversely on an<br />\nacademic pursuit. The University administration apparently<br />\nfeels that it should avoid problems in negotiations which<br />\ninvolve the government, as do the the Sponsored Research<br />\narbitrations.

Men born to freedom<br />\nare naturally alert to repel<br />\ninvasion of their liberty by<br />\nevil-minded rulers. The greatest<br />\ndangers to liberty lurk in<br />\ninsidious encroachment by men<br />\nof zeal, well-meaning but without<br />\nunderstanding.\"<br />\nIt is well worth pondering<br />\nthese words of our great Supreme<br />\nCourt Justice Louis D. Brandeis<br />\nin light of the developing<br />\npost-Watergate mentality. In its<br />\nwake, a rash of \"reform\" bills<br />\nhave been stampeded through<br />\nlocal, state, and national<br />\nlegislatures in what resembles a<br />\nmodern day throwback to<br />\nancient purification rites.<br />\nWith bi-partisan support, both<br />\nhouses of Congress had no<br />\ndifficulty in passing the new<br />\nFederal Election Campaign Act<br />\nof 1974 (FECA). Proponents<br />\nargue that such legislation is<br />\nnecessary in order to sever the<br />\nties which exist between big<br />\nmoney and politics and, to the<br />\nrout out the corruption which is<br />\nso pervasive in high governmental<br />\npositions.<br />\nWhile such liberal sponsors as<br />\nRep. Morriss Udall (D-Arizona)<br />\nclaim that the FECA will cleanse<br />\nthe political process, they ignore<br />\nsome serious constitutional<br />\nquestions that are raised. Such<br />\ncriticism cannot simply be<br />\nwritten off as academic<br />\nnit-picking, for many sections of<br />\nthis statute do represent a<br />\nsubstantial threat to the civil<br />\nliberties of millions of American<br />\ncitizens.<br />\nFirst, FECA places a limitation<br />\non the amount of money that<br />\ncandidates for federal office may<br />\nspend to communicate with the<br />\nelectorate. In effect, this<br />\namounts to an abridgement of<br />\nthe First Amendment right to<br />\nfreedom of expression. Such a<br />\nrestriction on expenditures in<br />\ncampaigns has led many critics to<br />\nrelabel this new federal law,\"The<br />\nIncumbent Protection Act,\" for<br />\nidentical spending ceilings are put<br />\non the challenger as well as the<br />\nincumbent. (It must be pointed<br /><br />\nout that the majority of the<br />\nchallengers who were able to<br />\ndefeat incumbents in the 1972<br />\nand 1974 congressional races did<br />\nso by spending more than this<br />\nnew law would allow.) Especially<br />\nhurt will be political dissidents<br />\nwhose views do not normally<br />\nreceive press exposure.<br />\nSecond, this bill restricts the<br />\namount of money that one<br />\nperson can contribute to political<br />\ncandidates ($1,000). However,<br /><br />\nFECA is filled with loopholes to<br />\nmaintain the privileged influence<br />\nof special interests. Wealthy<br />\ncontributors can still dictate to<br />\nelected officials through the<br />\nformation of \"voluntary\"<br />\npolitical funds.<br />\nThird, all candidates and<br />\npolitical committees are required<br />\nto keep a \"detailed account\" of<br />\neach contributor's \"full name<br />\nand the full address of his<br />\nprincipal place of residence.\"<br />\nThese records are available for<br />\ngovernment inspection at any<br />\ntime. The effect of this provision,<br />\nthen, is to erode the right of<br />\nprivacy. By mandating disclosure<br />\nof small contributors who cannot<br />\npossibly purchase campaign<br />\ncommitments, the law will deter<br />\nmany from active participation in<br />\nthe political process. It will<br />\nessentially legalize past<br />\ngovernment programs of<br />\nharassment against leftist<br />\npolitical groups and give added<br />\nimpetus to future disruptive<br />\ncampaigns. Those with radical or<br /><br />\nunpopular stands will think twice<br />\nbefore adding their names to yet<br />\nanother dossier.<br />\nFourth, FECA gives public<br />\nfunding to candidates and parties<br />\nfor Presidential primaries,<br />\nconventions, and the general<br />\nelection. The \"catch,\" though, is<br />\nthat only the Democrats and<br />\nRepublicans would receive such<br />\nfunding. A spokesman for the<br />\n\"public-interest\" group Common<br />\nCause neatly summed up what<br />\nwould be the law's effect: \"There<br />\nis nothing in the Constitution<br />\nthat says you cannot by law<br />\nfocus the energies of the nation<br />\ninto two major political parties.\"<br />\nThe FECA effectively screens out<br />\nminor parties, while giving<br />\nwelfare handouts to the two<br />\nmajor parties.<br />\nTo be vehemently opposed to<br />\nsuch reformist shams does not<br />\nmean that one is against true<br />\nreforms. However, this bill<br />\nmaintains the \"status quo\" while<br />\nfronting as a liberal \"reform.\"<br />\nOpposition to FECA is unique, in<br />\nthat the political boundaries<br />\nwhich normally define right and<br />\nleft evaporate, being no longer<br />\nrelevant to the issue. In fact, it<br />\nwas an odd couple indeed who<br />\nled an unsuccessful challenge in<br />\nthe U.S. Court of Appeals in<br />\nWashington\u2014former Minnesota<br />\nSenator Eugene McCarthy and<br />\nNew York's Senator James<br />\nBuckley\u2014and are now taking<br />\ntheir appeal to the Supreme<br />\nCourt.

Those<br />\nwho went to see Williams<br />\nexpecting a re-creation of the<br />\nman who \"never wrote a book<br />\nthat didn't sell' were<br />\ndisappointed.\"Emlyn Williams as<br />\nCharles Dickens\" was a<br />\nre-creation of the readings done<br />\non tour by Charles Dickens in<br />\n1853, and not an attempt to<br />\nrecapture the essence of the man.<br />\nWilliams said his<br />\ncharacterization of Dickens on<br />\nthe stage comes not from<br />\nresearch into the man but simply<br />\nfrom his impressions of Dickens<br />\nthrough his novels. \"If I were<br />\nDickens that's how I'd have done<br />\nthe readings.\"William's purpose in<br />\nhis performance was clear. His<br />\nPrimary intent was simply to<br />\nentertain his audience, not to be<br />\nDickens for an evening.<br />\nWhich is not to say that<br />\nmerely entertaining an audience<br />\nis bad. That was Dickens'<br />\nforemost purpose in writing, so<br />\nperhaps the most honest tribute<br />\nWilliams could have paid the<br />\nauthor was to put on the most<br />\nentertaining show he possibly<br />\nCould. Nevertheless, while<br />\nWilliams's performance was,<br />\n\"Triumphant.

There is still a place for<br />\nsentimentality in the American<br />\nTheatre. The witty, satirical<br />\ndescription and dialogue in<br />\nDickens provides the texture of<br />\nthe novels. Sentimentality,<br /><br />\nRomanticism, and to some<br />\nextent, tragedy, lie at the core of<br />\nmany of Dickens's novels, and it<br />\nis on this basis that I take<br />\nexception with Williams's<br />\nperformance. Williams, in<br />\nattempting to convey the sense<br />\nof the man from his writings,<br />\nfailed to do so, for he neglected<br />\nto make the audience aware of<br />\nwhat lay at the heart of Dickens's<br />\nliterary endeavors\u2014a<br />\nromantically sentimental view of<br />\nthe human condition.<br />\nBalance<br />\nThere was not enough of the<br />\nemotion and romantic idealism in<br />\nthe performance to give the work<br /><br />\nbalance. There were not enough<br />\npowerful lines such as the closing<br />\nof A Tale of Two Cities: \"It is a<br />\nfar, far better thing that I do,<br />\nthan I have ever done; it is a far,<br />\nfar better rest that I go to than I<br />\nhave ever known.\" Williams, in<br />\nhis desire to please his audience,<br />\ngave a less than satisfying<br />\nperformance. His selection of<br />\nreadings did not adequately<br />\nreflect both sides of the man or<br />\nhis writing. It was certainly not<br />\nWilliams's performance that was<br />\nlacking, but rather the idea that a<br />\nre-creation of Dickens's tour<br />\nalone could yield a thoroughly<br />\nsuccessful dramatic presentation.<br /><br />\nThe rains keep a'comin',the magic,whither has it fled?<br />\nBy RUSS SMITH<br />\nMaybe we've been spoiled, but<br />\nthe World Series isn't supposed<br />\nto be up for grabs this late in<br />\nOctober.
