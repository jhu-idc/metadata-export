Constant effort and originality, together with a ready adaptability to new and<br />\ndifficult situations must characterize the Council president.

His attention must also be directed to the<br />\nsomewhat ludicrous provision of the code that even<br />\nthough the student is \"on his honor\" he must not,<br />\nunder any circumstances, leave the room during an<br />\n.examination.
