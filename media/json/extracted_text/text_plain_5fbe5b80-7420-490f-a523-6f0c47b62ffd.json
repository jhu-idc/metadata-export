The<br />\nreport presented plans for both<br />\ncooperation and merger, Plan A<br />\nand Plan B, respectively, and<br />\nstated, \"the proposals in Plan<br />\nA...in no way conflict with those<br />\nin Plan B.\"<br />\nThe faculty action, which has<br />\nnot been announced to Goucher<br />\nstudents, is expected to influence.<br />\nthe College's Board of Trustees<br />\nto support increased cooperation,<br />\nand not merger, at its monthly<br />\nmeeting tomorrow, on the<br />\nTowson campus.<br />\nReached yesterday, Walter<br />\nSondheim, Jr., Chairman of<br />\nGoucher's Board, remarked,\"l'm<br />\n<br />\nnot going to comment on this to<br />\nthe News\u2014Letter because I don't<br />\nthink it's right to discuss in a<br />\nnewspaper a matter that's up<br />\nbefore a college community.\"<br />\nDr. Rhoda Dorsey, Goucher's<br />\nacting president, declined to<br />\ncoThment on the faculty meeting,<br />\nand stated, \"I don't think this is<br />\na terribly good time to comment.<br />\nI'm not going to say anything<br />\nuntil this matter is finished.\"<br />\nDorsey indicated that the<br />\nTrustees are expected to<br />\ncomplete their review of the<br />\nproposals at tomorrow's meeting,<br />\n\"But they might ask for some<br />\nmore time,\" she said.<br />\nOne faculty member, who<br />\nasked not to be identified,<br />\n<br />\nNew discipline code gets SC nod<br />\nBy ALLEN SHORT<br />\nIn action which signalled the<br />\ndemise of the proposed Code on<br />\nStudent Rights and Disciplinary<br />\nProcedures, the Student Council<br />\nTuesday gave tentative approval<br />\nto an alternative code written<br />\nand introduced by council<br />\npresident Andrew W.

Both men favor a<br />\nunified University identification<br />\nsystem which would facilitate the<br />\nborrowing of books within the<br />\nUniversity's divisions.

Nevertheless, one<br />\ndepartment, the Humanities<br />\nCenter, was surprised to learn<br />\nthat they offered an accelerated<br />\nB.A.\u2014M.A. program for<br />\nexceptional undergraduates \u2014 a<br />\nfact unknown to them prior to<br />\nthe Circular's publication.<br />\nKleis stated that, overall, the<br />\nresearch and information<br />\ngathered over the period<br />\nextending from October 1972 to<br />\nJuly was correct and accurate to<br />\nthe best of anyone's ability. The<br />\ndirector, commenting on the<br />\neffort, said,\"When you have that<br />\nmany people involved, there are<br />\ngoing to be errors \u2014 there have to<br />\nbe errors.\"<br />\n<br />\nFarber also stated that Abzug<br />\nwould speak at Hopkins<br />\nsometime this year. \"We were<br />\noffered dates in October and<br />\nNovember, but with Congress in<br />\nsession, we thought she might<br />\nhave to cancel, so we'll probably<br />\nhave her in February,\" Farber<br />\nsaid.<br />\nCissy Farenthold, a<br />\nDemocratic candidate for<br />\ngovernor of Texas in 1972, is also<br />\na possible speaker, she noted.<br />\nFarber, co-founder of the<br />\ncenter, also described at the<br />\nmeeting the difficult conditions<br />\nfaced by women at Hopkins in<br />\nrecent years.

We join Goucher's students<br />\nand faculty in a sigh of relief.<br />\n<br />\nGoucher Trustee action favoring increased cooperation<br />\nbetween the two institutions is as welcome as it is anticipated.<br />\nBut there is no reason for the University and the College, with<br />\ntheir complementary facilities and faculties, to engage in this<br />\nelaborate charade, this absurd rite d'amour, again. If, as the<br />\nreport states, Plan A (cooperation) may lead to Plan B (merger),<br />\nwhen the translettric leap is next proposed, as it assuredly will<br />\nbe, the mockery which both institutions have made of \"open<br />\ndiscussions\" must not re-emerge.<br />\nFor a plan to be discussed on its merits, in a more-or-less<br />\nrational manner, would be more becoming of both academic<br />\ncommunities than the spectacle which has up to now been<br />\nwitnessed. As these things go, the proposals facing both schools<br />\nare serious business, and it is not fitting for administrators to<br />\neither clam up (as with Goucher's staff), or to shoot from the<br />\nhip (as did President Muller on September 5, when, referring to<br />\nGoucher, he said, \"The gun is at their head.\")<br />\n<br />\n'<br />\n<br />\nMuller's remark, which has not been followed by any<br />\nresponsible public statement from his office, has unfortunately<br />\nset the tone and substance of much of the informal discussions<br />\nnow going on here at Hopkins.<br />\nThe situation at Goucher is no less upsetting. For that<br />\nCollege's students not to be informed of last Saturday's faculty<br />\naction begs for explanation.

Kent<br />\nThe Humanities Center<br />\n<br />\nTo the Editor:<br />\nThe blatant use of propaganda<br />\nfound on page one of the<br />\nNews-Letter (September 14,1973)<br />\nwas revolting. I found the<br />\nphotograph of the bulletin board<br />\ndepicted as one for the posting of<br />\nbridal and engagement<br />\nannouncements (which, by the<br />\nway, is located in the post office of<br />\nGoucher's College Center and not<br />\nthe Student Center as stated by the<br />\npicture's caption): to be a<br />\ncontinued propagation of the false<br />\nconception that women go to<br />\nGoucher in order to receive their<br />\n\"Mrs. degree.\" This picture was in<br />\nno way directly relevant to the<br />\narticle which accompanied it \u2014<br />\ncertainly, a more representative<br />\nview of Goucher could have been<br />\nchosen. That the Editor would<br />\napprove the use of such a picture<br />\nindicates that the macho way of<br />\nthinking obviously dominates at<br />\nHopkins. I, for one, refuse to ever<br />\nbecome a second-class citizen at<br />\nany institution which calls itself<br />\n\"the Goucher College of Johns<br />\nHopkins University.\"<br />\nLinda A. Moore<br />\nGoucher College<br />\n<br />\nTo the Editor:<br />\nIn the four years I've been at<br />\nHopkins I've suffered some defeats<br />\nat Goucher, and yet also I've<br />\nenjoyed knowing some wonderful<br />\ngirls out there. My experience has<br />\nbeen, however, that to a large part,<br />\nrelationships are predicated by the<br />\ncircumstances underwhich you<br />\nmeet someone. I wonder if the<br />\npeople who've recently written<br />\nletters to this column enjoyed<br />\nmore interpersonal success at a<br />\nbeach or on a blind date? The fact<br />\nremains that both Hopkins and<br />\nGoucher are intense schools where<br />\neveryone could benefit from a<br />\nmore relaxed atmosphere. If<br />\nrelationships could be fostered<br />\nrather than picked at a mixer, the<br />\nexperience would be different. At<br />\nthe same time, each school would<br />\nenjoy a greater depth in curriculum<br />\nand thought. If Goucher students<br />\nvote down the coordinated<br />\nprogram this weekend, then both<br />\nschools lose, probably due to the<br />\nvocality of a few personal<br />\nvendettas.<br />\n<br />\nTam<br />\n<br />\nOver seven-hundred years ago,<br />\nexceptions, amends every section<br />\nyoung English noblemen were<br />\nin the state code by substituting<br />\nrecognized by their elders to be<br />\neighteen for twenty-one The<br />\nadults at twenty-one because at<br />\nchange was considerable.

The varsity soccer team is<br />\nloaded, with skill and talent<br />\nexisting not only in the veteran<br />\nhalf but also in the rookie<br />\nmembers of the squad. But as<br />\none may have noticed in the<br />\npreseason games, the skills<br />\ntended to vanish due to some<br />\nmental attitude that seems to<br />\nhave covered the team like a<br />\nblanket. This blanket doesn't<br />\nseem to block the skills, rather it<br />\n<br />\nkeeps the players from using<br />\ntheir skills properly.<br />\nThe Blue Jays travelled to<br />\nGeorge Washington University<br />\nlast Saturday to initiate the<br />\nColonials in what was the first<br />\ngame of their season but only a<br />\nscrimmage for the Hopkins team.<br />\nThe game was constantly<br />\nill-flavored with touches of the<br />\nroller-derby spirit and with only<br />\none referee, the game sometimes<br />\ngot out of control.<br />\nBut no matter what the tone<br />\nof the game was, soccer coach<br />\nRobert Oliver still tries to reason<br />\nwhy a team as good as his<br />\nmanaged fewer than ten shots in<br />\nthe 90-minute game.<br />\nThe only threat to the Blue<br />\nJays defensively this year as it<br />\nwas last year, will be the fast<br />\nbreak.

The<br />\nsad part of the story is the<br />\nnumber of opportunities prior to<br />\nBukowski's goal that the more<br />\nexperienced offensive squad did<br />\nnot take advantage of. In simple<br />\nterms, he wasn't afraid to put his<br />\nfoot to the ball and take a shot.<br />\n<br />\nCountless times in the past<br />\nscrimmages, there appeared to be<br />\nan \"I'm afraid I might miss it\"<br />\nattitude. It's almost like the ball<br />\nis made of glass and everyone is<br />\nafraid to kick it for fear of<br />\nbreaking it.<br />\nCoach Oliver<br />\nCoach Oliver can sometimes be<br />\nseen on the sideline, pleading<br />\nwith a player on the field to<br />\nshoot the ball, but to no avail as<br />\nthe player decides he better pass<br />\nthe ball or dribble out of the<br />\ncrowd. To this day, coach Oliver<br />\nhas never been the slightest bit<br />\n<br />\ndispleased with someone who<br />\nattempted a shot.<br />\nWhat the team needs is a<br />\nmood, not the frightened and shy<br />\nmood which they have been<br />\ndisplaying in the past, but a<br />\npositive, easy mood that won't<br />\nallow fear to enter into a game.<br />\nIt's almost out of the hands of<br />\ncoach Oliver whose superior<br />\ncoaching abilities has put the<br />\nteam in the position to go all the<br />\nway this season. Now it's up to<br />\nthe players. Tomorrow's game<br />\nshould be very interesting; come<br />\nout and see it.<br />\n<br />\nDon Masken: a successful coach<br />\nIf anything is to speak well of<br />\na coach, it has to be how much<br />\nhe has improved the quality of<br />\nthe teams he has coached. If this<br />\nis the criteria for evaluation, then<br />\nDon Masken certainly has to be<br />\nconsidered successful.<br />\nIn his six years as coach, the<br />\ncross-country teams have<br />\nprogressed from rarely winning<br />\nto near the .500 mark in the last<br />\ntwo campaigns, and his track<br />\nteams have gone over the .750<br />\nmark in the same span. What<br />\nmakes this more outstanding is<br />\nthat Masken is one of the<br />\nHopkins part-time coaches,<br />\nalthough any veteran team<br />\nmember will tell you that no one<br />\nis around more often than Don<br />\nMasken is, even in the off-season.<br />\nA resident of Baltimore, Coach<br />\nMasken is a former track star at<br />\nBaltimore City College, and later<br />\n<br />\nat Towson State. He ran<br />\ncross-country and track,<br />\nsometimes tripling in the half,<br />\nthe mile and the two-mile \"when<br />\nI had a chance to get a good<br />\nplace in all three.\" He is a former<br />\nchairman of the track and field<br />\ndivision of the Maryland AAU,<br />\nand is currently in the real estate<br />\nfield.<br />\nOne of the strong points of his<br />\ncoaching has to be the attention<br />\nMasken pays to each of the<br />\nindividuals on his teams. His<br />\nchief concern is personal<br />\nimprovement, and he is satisfied<br />\nif a runner improves his previous<br />\nbest time even if he doesn't win.<br />\nResurgence<br />\nIt may have been this<br />\nde-emphasis on pressure that<br />\nprompted 1969 team captain Al<br />\nGoldberg to coax eight of his<br />\nfraternity brothers to run track.<br />\n<br />\nOn of the things that leaves a<br />\nbitter taste for Coach Masken is<br />\nthat each year there is a pool of<br />\nHopkins track talent that doesn't<br />\ncome out for the team. But in<br />\ngeneral the academic - pursuits of<br />\nhis runners do not make his job<br />\nany more difficult.

This effort is being<br />\nconcentrated in approximately<br />\n63 cities across the country<br />\nincluding Baltimore.<br />\nAccording to Bill Randall, a<br />\nspokesman for the UFW<br />\nBaltimore Boycott Office, the<br />\nboycott in Baltimore is being<br />\ndirected primarily against A&P<br />\nfoodstores. \"We are one of the<br />\n<br />\n\"I'm all for the Union<br />\nbusiness\" Belli remarked \"but<br />\nmy experience in the past with<br />\ntheir product has been that it has<br />\noften been of inferior quality to<br />\nnon-union lettuce.\"<br />\n\"I just can't afford to take a<br />\nchance with the quality,\" she<br />\nadded. Belli also commented that<br />\nshe had received no requests to<br />\nbuy Union lettuce. Tom Tanglos.<br />\nmanager for the dorm cafeteria<br />\nwas unavailable for comment.<br />\n\"We have been having good<br />\nsuccess on the picket lines and<br />\nthe store managers haven't been<br />\nhassling us too much,\" Randall<br />\nremarked. He explained that<br />\nmost people were very<br />\nunderstanding and that the<br />\nsuccess of the boycott was<br />\n<br />\nlargely do to the 1 -to-1<br />\ninteraction between the pickets<br />\nand consumers.<br />\nRandall further explained that<br />\nin addition to the boycott, he<br />\nand his fellow Union members<br />\nwere seeking support from<br />\nchurch and community groups<br />\nand students.<br />\nIn a conversation Tuesday<br />\nwith University Chaplain Dr.<br />\nChester Wickwire, Randall<br />\ndiscussed the possibility of<br />\ndrumming up student support for<br />\nthe A&P boycott. \"Students<br />\nseem to have -a fair amount of<br />\nfree time,\" Randall said \"and we<br />\nfeel that they could help the<br />\nFarm Workers in their struggle.\"<br />\nRandall commented that he<br />\nhas been going to many of the<br />\n<br />\narea campuses investigating the<br />\nextent and use of non-union<br />\nlettuce and the level of student<br />\nsupport.<br />\nBoth Wickwire and Randall<br />\nnoted that UFW leader Cesar<br />\nChavez would be in town at the<br />\nend of October or the beginning<br />\nof November and that some plans<br />\nwere being considered to have<br />\nhim speak on campus.<br />\nThe current boycott against<br />\nlettuce and grapes began in April<br />\nwhen Coachella Valley growers<br />\ncancelled contract negotiations<br />\nwith the Farm Workers and<br />\nsigned with the Teamsters.<br />\nFollowing an outbreak of<br />\nviolence in the Delano Valley and<br />\nthe subsequent murder of two<br />\nUFW union members, the<br />\n<br />\nTeamsters repudiated the 30<br />\nDelano Valley contracts which<br />\nthey had signed. Randall termed<br />\nthis a \"publicity stunt\" and said<br />\nthat the contracts are still valid<br />\nand that the repudiation means<br />\nnothing unless new negotiations<br />\nare begun.'<br />\nThe problem centers around<br />\nthe fact that the Teamsters claim<br />\nto represent the Farm Workers<br />\nwhile in fact the UFW has<br />\nemphasized that this is not so.<br />\nNevertheless, the grape and<br />\nlettuce growers have refused to<br />\ndeal with the UFW,alleging that<br />\nthe problem must be worked out<br />\namong the union leadership.

Nevertheless, one<br />\ndepartment, the Humanities<br />\nCenter, was surprised to learn<br />\nthat they offered an accelerated<br />\nB.A.\u2014M.A. program for<br />\nexceptional undergraduates \u2014 a<br />\nfact unknown to them prior to<br />\nthe Circular's publication.<br />\nKleis stated that, overall, the<br />\nresearch and information<br />\ngathered over the period<br />\nextending from October 1972 to<br />\nJuly was correct and accurate to<br />\nthe best of anyone's ability. The<br />\ndirector, commenting on the<br />\neffort, said,\"When you have that<br />\nmany people involved, there are<br />\ngoing to be errors \u2014 there have to<br />\nbe errors.\"<br /><br />\nFarber also stated that Abzug<br />\nwould speak at Hopkins<br />\nsometime this year. \"We were<br />\noffered dates in October and<br />\nNovember, but with Congress in<br />\nsession, we thought she might<br />\nhave to cancel, so we'll probably<br />\nhave her in February,\" Farber<br />\nsaid.<br />\nCissy Farenthold, a<br />\nDemocratic candidate for<br />\ngovernor of Texas in 1972, is also<br />\na possible speaker, she noted.<br />\nFarber, co-founder of the<br />\ncenter, also described at the<br />\nmeeting the difficult conditions<br />\nfaced by women at Hopkins in<br />\nrecent years.

We join Goucher's students<br />\nand faculty in a sigh of relief.<br /><br />\nGoucher Trustee action favoring increased cooperation<br />\nbetween the two institutions is as welcome as it is anticipated.<br />\nBut there is no reason for the University and the College, with<br />\ntheir complementary facilities and faculties, to engage in this<br />\nelaborate charade, this absurd rite d'amour, again. If, as the<br />\nreport states, Plan A (cooperation) may lead to Plan B (merger),<br />\nwhen the translettric leap is next proposed, as it assuredly will<br />\nbe, the mockery which both institutions have made of \"open<br />\ndiscussions\" must not re-emerge.<br />\nFor a plan to be discussed on its merits, in a more-or-less<br />\nrational manner, would be more becoming of both academic<br />\ncommunities than the spectacle which has up to now been<br />\nwitnessed. As these things go, the proposals facing both schools<br />\nare serious business, and it is not fitting for administrators to<br />\neither clam up (as with Goucher's staff), or to shoot from the<br />\nhip (as did President Muller on September 5, when, referring to<br />\nGoucher, he said, \"The gun is at their head.\")<br /><br />\n'<br /><br />\nMuller's remark, which has not been followed by any<br />\nresponsible public statement from his office, has unfortunately<br />\nset the tone and substance of much of the informal discussions<br />\nnow going on here at Hopkins.<br />\nThe situation at Goucher is no less upsetting. For that<br />\nCollege's students not to be informed of last Saturday's faculty<br />\naction begs for explanation.

Kent<br />\nThe Humanities Center<br /><br />\nTo the Editor:<br />\nThe blatant use of propaganda<br />\nfound on page one of the<br />\nNews-Letter (September 14,1973)<br />\nwas revolting. I found the<br />\nphotograph of the bulletin board<br />\ndepicted as one for the posting of<br />\nbridal and engagement<br />\nannouncements (which, by the<br />\nway, is located in the post office of<br />\nGoucher's College Center and not<br />\nthe Student Center as stated by the<br />\npicture's caption): to be a<br />\ncontinued propagation of the false<br />\nconception that women go to<br />\nGoucher in order to receive their<br />\n\"Mrs. degree.\" This picture was in<br />\nno way directly relevant to the<br />\narticle which accompanied it \u2014<br />\ncertainly, a more representative<br />\nview of Goucher could have been<br />\nchosen. That the Editor would<br />\napprove the use of such a picture<br />\nindicates that the macho way of<br />\nthinking obviously dominates at<br />\nHopkins. I, for one, refuse to ever<br />\nbecome a second-class citizen at<br />\nany institution which calls itself<br />\n\"the Goucher College of Johns<br />\nHopkins University.\"<br />\nLinda A. Moore<br />\nGoucher College<br /><br />\nTo the Editor:<br />\nIn the four years I've been at<br />\nHopkins I've suffered some defeats<br />\nat Goucher, and yet also I've<br />\nenjoyed knowing some wonderful<br />\ngirls out there. My experience has<br />\nbeen, however, that to a large part,<br />\nrelationships are predicated by the<br />\ncircumstances underwhich you<br />\nmeet someone. I wonder if the<br />\npeople who've recently written<br />\nletters to this column enjoyed<br />\nmore interpersonal success at a<br />\nbeach or on a blind date? The fact<br />\nremains that both Hopkins and<br />\nGoucher are intense schools where<br />\neveryone could benefit from a<br />\nmore relaxed atmosphere. If<br />\nrelationships could be fostered<br />\nrather than picked at a mixer, the<br />\nexperience would be different. At<br />\nthe same time, each school would<br />\nenjoy a greater depth in curriculum<br />\nand thought. If Goucher students<br />\nvote down the coordinated<br />\nprogram this weekend, then both<br />\nschools lose, probably due to the<br />\nvocality of a few personal<br />\nvendettas.<br /><br />\nTam<br /><br />\nOver seven-hundred years ago,<br />\nexceptions, amends every section<br />\nyoung English noblemen were<br />\nin the state code by substituting<br />\nrecognized by their elders to be<br />\neighteen for twenty-one The<br />\nadults at twenty-one because at<br />\nchange was considerable.

Both<br />\nare currently members of the<br />\nHopkins coaching staff.<br />\nThe alumni make up an even<br />\nlarger portion of the Club squad.<br />\nAttackman Downy McCarty joins<br />\nmid fielders Gary Handleman,<br />\nCharley Coker, Homer Schwartz,<br />\nand \"Bazooka\" Bergofsky, in an<br />\neffort to top the younger set.<br />\nThe Homewood contingent is<br />\nnot the only group participating<br />\nin the game, as several of the<br />\ncurrent All Americans will be<br />\nhere and the club ranks provide<br />\nsome of the stellar stickers of the<br />\npast decade.<br />\nHalftime entertainment will be<br />\nprovided as Maryland coach<br />\nBuddy Beardmore presides over<br />\nan exhibition of goal shooting by<br />\nmembers of the sports media.<br />\nTickets may be purchased in<br />\nadvance, $2.00 for adults, $1.00<br />\nfor children under 12.<br />\nTickets are available for<br />\nadvance sale at the Lacrosse Hall<br />\nof Fame in the Athletic Center,<br />\ndt the Crease Restaurant in<br />\nTowson, Bacharach-Rasin, and<br />\nSTX Inc. Ticket prices at the gate<br />\nwill be a dollar more!<br /><br />\nbacks and the composure of the<br />\nteam falls apart.<br />\nMaybe the members of the<br />\nteam need the spirits of<br />\nsophomore Jack Bukowski, who<br />\nscored one of the first three goals<br />\nwhen put into the Dundalk<br />\nCommunity College scrimmage as<br />\na right wing last Tuesday. The<br />\nsad part of the story is the<br />\nnumber of opportunities prior to<br />\nBukowski's goal that the more<br />\nexperienced offensive squad did<br />\nnot take advantage of. In simple<br />\nterms, he wasn't afraid to put his<br />\nfoot to the ball and take a shot.<br /><br />\nCountless times in the past<br />\nscrimmages, there appeared to be<br />\nan \"I'm afraid I might miss it\"<br />\nattitude. It's almost like the ball<br />\nis made of glass and everyone is<br />\nafraid to kick it for fear of<br />\nbreaking it.<br />\nCoach Oliver<br />\nCoach Oliver can sometimes be<br />\nseen on the sideline, pleading<br />\nwith a player on the field to<br />\nshoot the ball, but to no avail as<br />\nthe player decides he better pass<br />\nthe ball or dribble out of the<br />\ncrowd. To this day, coach Oliver<br />\nhas never been the slightest bit<br /><br />\ndispleased with someone who<br />\nattempted a shot.<br />\nWhat the team needs is a<br />\nmood, not the frightened and shy<br />\nmood which they have been<br />\ndisplaying in the past, but a<br />\npositive, easy mood that won't<br />\nallow fear to enter into a game.<br />\nIt's almost out of the hands of<br />\ncoach Oliver whose superior<br />\ncoaching abilities has put the<br />\nteam in the position to go all the<br />\nway this season. Now it's up to<br />\nthe players. Tomorrow's game<br />\nshould be very interesting; come<br />\nout and see it.<br /><br />\nDon Masken: a successful coach<br />\nIf anything is to speak well of<br />\na coach, it has to be how much<br />\nhe has improved the quality of<br />\nthe teams he has coached. If this<br />\nis the criteria for evaluation, then<br />\nDon Masken certainly has to be<br />\nconsidered successful.<br />\nIn his six years as coach, the<br />\ncross-country teams have<br />\nprogressed from rarely winning<br />\nto near the .500 mark in the last<br />\ntwo campaigns, and his track<br />\nteams have gone over the .750<br />\nmark in the same span. What<br />\nmakes this more outstanding is<br />\nthat Masken is one of the<br />\nHopkins part-time coaches,<br />\nalthough any veteran team<br />\nmember will tell you that no one<br />\nis around more often than Don<br />\nMasken is, even in the off-season.<br />\nA resident of Baltimore, Coach<br />\nMasken is a former track star at<br />\nBaltimore City College, and later<br /><br />\nat Towson State. He ran<br />\ncross-country and track,<br />\nsometimes tripling in the half,<br />\nthe mile and the two-mile \"when<br />\nI had a chance to get a good<br />\nplace in all three.\" He is a former<br />\nchairman of the track and field<br />\ndivision of the Maryland AAU,<br />\nand is currently in the real estate<br />\nfield.<br />\nOne of the strong points of his<br />\ncoaching has to be the attention<br />\nMasken pays to each of the<br />\nindividuals on his teams. His<br />\nchief concern is personal<br />\nimprovement, and he is satisfied<br />\nif a runner improves his previous<br />\nbest time even if he doesn't win.<br />\nResurgence<br />\nIt may have been this<br />\nde-emphasis on pressure that<br />\nprompted 1969 team captain Al<br />\nGoldberg to coax eight of his<br />\nfraternity brothers to run track.<br /><br />\nOn of the things that leaves a<br />\nbitter taste for Coach Masken is<br />\nthat each year there is a pool of<br />\nHopkins track talent that doesn't<br />\ncome out for the team. But in<br />\ngeneral the academic - pursuits of<br />\nhis runners do not make his job<br />\nany more difficult. As he said<br />\nwith a grin, \"I've never met a<br />\nreally stupid runner.\"<br />\nDon Masken works really hard<br />\nto make track and cross-country<br />\na pleasant experience, one of the<br />\nfew places in the Hopkins sport<br />\nscene where all you need is the<br />\ndesire to be part of the team.<br />\nThis raised the team numbers to<br />\na respectable 20 man squad and<br />\nmarked the beginning of the<br />\nresurgence in Hopkins track.<br /><br />\ncross-country schedule<br /><br />\nsoccer schedule<br /><br />\nVARSITY<br />\nSat., Sept. 22 Haverford<br />\nWed., Sept. 26 Loyola<br />\nSat., Sept. 29 Towson State<br />\nWed., Oct. 3 Delaware<br />\nSat:, Oct. 6,Dickinson<br />\nWed., Oct. 10 Washington &amp; Lee<br />\nSat., Oct. 13 Swarthmore<br />\nThu., Oct. 18 Gettysburg<br />\nSat., Oct. 20 F &amp; M<br />\nSat., Oct. 27 UMBC<br />\nSat., Nov. 3 Washington<br />\nTue., Nov. 6 Western Maryland<br />\nSat., Nov 10 Widener<br /><br />\nBluejay Booters in Action<br /><br />\n12 Noon H<br />\n3-00 p.m. H<br />\n11 -00 a.m. A<br />\n3:00 p.m. H<br />\n12 Noon H<br />\n3-00 p.m. II<br />\n2-00 p.m A<br />\n3-00 p.m. H<br />\n2-00 p.m. A<br />\n12 Noon H<br />\n2-00 p.m. A<br />\n2-00 p.m. H<br />\n11:00 a.m. A<br /><br />\nSat., Sept. 29 Loyola<br />\nSat., Oct. 6 Dickinson &amp;<br />\nUrsinus<br />\nWed., Oct. 10 W.

This effort is being<br />\nconcentrated in approximately<br />\n63 cities across the country<br />\nincluding Baltimore.<br />\nAccording to Bill Randall, a<br />\nspokesman for the UFW<br />\nBaltimore Boycott Office, the<br />\nboycott in Baltimore is being<br />\ndirected primarily against A&amp;P<br />\nfoodstores. \"We are one of the<br /><br />\n\"I'm all for the Union<br />\nbusiness\" Belli remarked \"but<br />\nmy experience in the past with<br />\ntheir product has been that it has<br />\noften been of inferior quality to<br />\nnon-union lettuce.\"<br />\n\"I just can't afford to take a<br />\nchance with the quality,\" she<br />\nadded. Belli also commented that<br />\nshe had received no requests to<br />\nbuy Union lettuce. Tom Tanglos.<br />\nmanager for the dorm cafeteria<br />\nwas unavailable for comment.<br />\n\"We have been having good<br />\nsuccess on the picket lines and<br />\nthe store managers haven't been<br />\nhassling us too much,\" Randall<br />\nremarked. He explained that<br />\nmost people were very<br />\nunderstanding and that the<br />\nsuccess of the boycott was<br /><br />\nlargely do to the 1 -to-1<br />\ninteraction between the pickets<br />\nand consumers.<br />\nRandall further explained that<br />\nin addition to the boycott, he<br />\nand his fellow Union members<br />\nwere seeking support from<br />\nchurch and community groups<br />\nand students.<br />\nIn a conversation Tuesday<br />\nwith University Chaplain Dr.<br />\nChester Wickwire, Randall<br />\ndiscussed the possibility of<br />\ndrumming up student support for<br />\nthe A&amp;P boycott. \"Students<br />\nseem to have -a fair amount of<br />\nfree time,\" Randall said \"and we<br />\nfeel that they could help the<br />\nFarm Workers in their struggle.\"<br />\nRandall commented that he<br />\nhas been going to many of the<br /><br />\narea campuses investigating the<br />\nextent and use of non-union<br />\nlettuce and the level of student<br />\nsupport.<br />\nBoth Wickwire and Randall<br />\nnoted that UFW leader Cesar<br />\nChavez would be in town at the<br />\nend of October or the beginning<br />\nof November and that some plans<br />\nwere being considered to have<br />\nhim speak on campus.<br />\nThe current boycott against<br />\nlettuce and grapes began in April<br />\nwhen Coachella Valley growers<br />\ncancelled contract negotiations<br />\nwith the Farm Workers and<br />\nsigned with the Teamsters.<br />\nFollowing an outbreak of<br />\nviolence in the Delano Valley and<br />\nthe subsequent murder of two<br />\nUFW union members, the<br /><br />\nTeamsters repudiated the 30<br />\nDelano Valley contracts which<br />\nthey had signed. Randall termed<br />\nthis a \"publicity stunt\" and said<br />\nthat the contracts are still valid<br />\nand that the repudiation means<br />\nnothing unless new negotiations<br />\nare begun.'<br />\nThe problem centers around<br />\nthe fact that the Teamsters claim<br />\nto represent the Farm Workers<br />\nwhile in fact the UFW has<br />\nemphasized that this is not so.<br />\nNevertheless, the grape and<br />\nlettuce growers have refused to<br />\ndeal with the UFW,alleging that<br />\nthe problem must be worked out<br />\namong the union leadership. In<br />\nthe meantime, the growers have<br />\nchosen to deal only with the<br />\nTeamsters.<br /><br />\nMayor appoints municipal advisory panel<br /><br />\nDr. Chester Wickwire<br />\nprime boycott areas,\" said<br />\nRandall. \"A&amp;P considers<br />\nBaltimore one of its best areas<br />\nfor sale\" The boycott against<br />\nA&amp;P and Safeway Stores was<br />\nbegun last month and according<br />\nto Randall has been \"quite<br />\nsuccessful.\" Spokesmen for A&amp;P<br />\nwere unavailable for comment on<br />\nthe matter.<br />\nRandall has charged that Saga<br />\nFood Co., which provides the<br />\ncampus food service at Hopkins<br />\nwas using non-union lettuce.<br />\nRandall admitted, however, that<br />\nin fact he had not talked with<br />\nanyone from Saga.<br />\nAndrea Belli, Saga<br />\nrepresentative for the Levering<br />\nHall food service, stated that she<br />\nwas not using union lettuce.<br /><br />\nBy RONALD S.
