The seminar was given<br />\nfree by Citizens Against Crime,<br />\na private national safety organization that has forty offices across<br />\nthe country.<br />\nJulie Beckman, regional director of Citizens Against Crime and<br />\nthe seminar leader, began by asking, \"Do I have to convince you<br />\nthat crime is a problem?\" She<br />\nwent on to say that always<br />\nremembering that crime is a problem is the first step in preventing it from occurring.<br />\n\"Everybody has the potential to<br />\nbe a victim,\" she said. \"Once<br />\nyou believe that, you heighten<br />\nyour awareness and immediately<br />\ndecrease the chances that it will<br />\nbe you.\"<br />\nDuring the short, informative<br />\nseminar, Beckman pointed out<br />\nmany common sense tips that<br />\napply directly to students and can<br />\nbe employed to avoid becoming<br />\na victim. But first, she suggested<br />\na look at the criminal's perspective: \"Criminals do not strike at<br />\nrandom. They are looking for<br />\nvictims who are quick, easy, and<br />\nno risk.\" To reduce the chances<br />\nof being a victim, she said,\"You<br />\nneed to give a criminal a reason<br />\nto pass you by.\"<br />\nBeckman suggested that<br />\n<br />\nNews-Letter file<br />\n<br />\nSecurity director Robert Larkin said freshmen and other new students<br />\nshould be aware of their own security needs as soon as they arrive.<br />\nstudents walk confidently and<br />\nwith purpose, pay attention at all<br />\ntimes, and make eye contact with<br />\npeople on the street. If approached and threatened, students<br />\nshould go ahead and give money<br />\nor something of value rather than<br />\nput their well-being in jeopardy.<br />\nBeckman advised against<br />\nfighting in most cases, but said,<br />\n\"If you fight, fight to incapacitate, and use distance and<br />\nthe element of surprise to your<br />\nadvantage.\"<br />\n\"It's all about having a plan.\"<br />\nThis is Beckman's\u2014and many<br />\nsafety seminars'\u2014basic message.<br />\n<br />\nThough most of the tips are simple and seem obvious, talking<br />\nabout them, reemphasizing them,<br />\nand offering a different perspective raises awareness and ideally<br />\nencourages students to have in<br />\ntheir minds a smart way to handle difficult situations.<br />\nWhat, then, about students who<br />\ndo not \"have a plan\"?

However,<br />\nmany students do not take the<br />\ntime to attend a safety seminar<br />\nduring their time at Hopkins,<br />\neven though some come to<br />\nBaltimore totally unprepared for<br />\nHopkins's urban setting.<br />\nMany persons assume that<br />\nstudents receive all the information and training they need during the Orientation program, but<br />\nthat is not always so. As Perry explained, students receive security manuals when they arrive, and<br />\nthat her office tries to stress<br />\nrepeatedly some instructions on<br />\nthe major points of safety around<br />\nthe dorms, which include locking<br />\nboth individual and outside doors.<br />\nSecurity meetings are supposed to be held within each dorm.<br />\nYet Larkin reported that this year<br />\nHopkins Security met with only<br />\na few groups of freshmen, and<br />\nadded that most security information sessions held here are poorly attended. \"We can't get to the<br />\nfreshmen,\" he said.<br />\nLarkin emphasized the importance of informing freshmen early, before their living habits are<br />\nformed, so that common sense<br />\nand basic security measures can<br />\nbecome part of their natural indoctrination to Hopkins. Larkin<br />\nalso expressed regret that, under<br />\ncurrent programs, many students<br />\nare not contacted at all, particularly first-year grad students,<br />\n<br />\ncommuter students, and transfer<br />\nstudents. These are students who<br />\ndo not participate in Orientation<br />\nbut may come to Baltimore unprepared for the urban setting.<br />\nSusan Boswell, dean of<br />\nstudents, offers a balanced<br />\nperspective on the dual responsibilities of the student and the administration with regard to taking<br />\nmeasures to ensure an adequate<br />\nlevel of security.<br />\n\"I think that students need to<br />\ntake some responsibility for<br />\nthemselves and each other, and to<br />\ndo what they can to enhance their<br />\nown personal security,\" she said.<br />\n\"The main role of the administration, on the other hand, is to raise<br />\npeople's consciousness about the<br />\nrealities of living in a city.<br />\n\"That is not to say, however,<br />\nthat campus security has no<br />\nresponsibility,\" said Boswell. \"I<br />\nthink there's a real and genuine<br />\nconcern on the part of administration about the safety of students.\"<br />\nBoswell noted various efforts<br />\nthat the administration has taken<br />\nto enhance the safety of students,<br />\nincluding the regular sponsorship<br />\nof self-defense workshops and,<br />\nmore recently, a series of three<br />\nseminars on personal safety held<br />\nin conjunction with the Baltimore<br />\nPolice Department.<br />\nIn addition, Hopkins Campus<br />\nSecurity provides a variety of services of which many students are<br />\neither unaware or do not take full<br />\nadvantage. These include:<br />\n*Foot escorts in the immediate<br />\n<br />\narea around campus from 5 p.m.<br />\nto 6 a.m.<br />\n*Free use of an engraving tool,<br />\nwhich students can use to etch<br />\ntheir social security number on<br />\nvalubles such as stereos and<br />\ntelevisions so that the items can<br />\nbe traced by the Federal Bureau<br />\nof Investigation should they get<br />\nstolen.<br />\n*The availability of Krypton<br />\nbike locks, which Security considers the most secure, at cost for<br />\n$16 (they usually sell for over<br />\n$35);<br />\n*Escort van service, which<br />\noperates within a mile radius of<br />\nthe Hopkins campus daily between 5 p.m. and 2 a.m., and<br />\n*Twenty-four hour on-call service, at x7777, in case of an<br />\nemergency.<br />\nCampus security will also<br />\npatrol an office or lab when<br />\nstudents or staff are working late<br />\ninto the evening, both for safety<br />\nand because the potential for accidents occurring in a lab can be<br />\nhigh. In extreme circumstances<br />\nwhen the student has no recourse,<br />\ncampus patrol can pick up a<br />\nstranded student from as far away<br />\nas Towson State University or<br />\nGoucher College.<br />\n\"We're not here just to write<br />\ntickets,\" said Dara D'Adio, a<br />\ncampus security officer. \"I want<br />\nstudents here to realize that they<br />\nare my boss, and that I work for<br />\nthem. I want them to call on me<br />\nwhenever they need me for<br />\nwhatever reason.\"<br />\n<br />\nNews-Letter file<br />\n<br />\nDean of Students Susan Boswell said students should take more responsibility for their own security.<br />\nThe Hopkins Security employs<br />\ntwenty-seven full-time security<br />\nofficers, many of whom, like<br />\nD'Adio, are graduates of police<br />\nacademies and have worked as<br />\nregular city police. Although they<br />\nare not allowed to carry guns,<br />\ncampus security officers do have<br />\npowers of arrest, and search and<br />\nseizure.<br />\nLarkin noted that while the rate<br />\nof Baltimore crime has gone up,<br />\nthe rate of crimes committed on<br />\ncampus has, as a whole, declined.<br />\nTempesta attributes the relative<br />\nsecurity of the area surrounding<br />\nHomewood to the high visibility<br />\nof the Baltimore street police.<br />\n\"The police here take an active<br />\npursuit in the safety of<br />\nresidents,\" said Tempesta.\"We<br />\nget visits from police even when<br />\nthey're not on duty.\"<br />\n<br />\nOrin Hughes, a Hopkins<br />\nsecurity officer, believes the<br />\nquality of security around the area<br />\ncan be strengthened by two<br />\nelements: students input and suggestions; and campus security's<br />\nclose working relationship with<br />\nthe Baltimore Police Department.<br />\n\"It is remarkable that our student body cooperates so well and<br />\nso consistently with the security<br />\noffice in terms of feedback and<br />\nsuggestions,\" said Hughes.<br />\n\"Many of the ideas of students<br />\nwere implemented. For example,<br />\nthe escort van was made available<br />\nat the suggestion of several<br />\nstudents.<br />\n\"We also work hand and glove<br />\nwith the Baltimore Police,\" continued Hughes. \"I think it's best<br />\nwhen all parties concerned work<br />\ntogether.\"<br />\n<br />\nHOPPY HOUR<br />\nFriday, April 21<br />\nGlass Pavilion<br />\n4:30,=A7:00<br />\nFeaturing This Week:<br />\n<br />\nANDY MOFFITT<br />\nLOU GIANGIULIO<br />\nCo-sponsored by the Blue Key Society and FSI<br />\nOn Wednesday, May 3 there will be College Night at Memorial Stadium<br />\nwith the Orioles vs. the California Angels.

It may be<br />\nuseful if I address some of the<br />\nconcerns that have been raised.<br />\nThe Chaplain's Office fills<br />\nmany roles. We coordinate<br />\nvolunteer projects for students,<br />\noffer interfaith services, counseling, weddings, and Bible study<br />\nand discussion groups, and sponsor a variety of educational programs, including academic<br />\ncourses, lectures, plays,<br />\nworkshops, and forums. We provide a home for several student<br />\ngroups, and opportunities for<br />\nmembers of the Hopkins community to become involved in the<br />\nlarger community, through local<br />\nchurches and organizations and<br />\nthrough projects with a national<br />\nor international focus.<br />\nThe programs that have been<br />\ncontroversial take up a relatively<br />\nsmall portion of our energy. Yet<br />\nthey are important. In addition to<br />\nits other functions, the Chaplain's<br />\nOffice has traditionally provided<br />\na forum for the expression of<br />\nalternative views and positions<br />\n<br />\nwhich challenge accepted<br />\n\"truths.\" This remains a vital<br />\naspect of what we do. The conventional voices are heard<br />\nthroughout our society and our<br />\nUniversity. We are enriched by<br />\nbringing alternative voices to<br />\ncampus so that we can learn from<br />\nthose outside the mainstream of<br />\nour social, political, and religious<br />\ninstitutions. We will not all agree<br />\nwith the views presented. Some<br />\nideas will be disturbing and uncomfortable. But we need these<br />\nalternative voices to encourage us<br />\nto look beyond our accepted ways<br />\nof thinking. Doung so is essential<br />\nin a university whose purpose is<br />\nnot merely to transmit the<br />\nestablished truth, but to create<br />\nnew truths by questioning the old.<br />\nIf we are unable or unwilling to<br />\nhear those who challenge our<br />\nbeliefs and the norms of our<br />\nsociety, we will be unable to envision and create a more just and<br />\nhumane world. We will all be<br />\npoorer\u2014intellectually, morally,<br />\nand spiritually.<br />\nThe issue which has emerged<br />\nas the center of concern is that of<br />\nthe proper relation between<br />\nreligion and social/political ac-<br />\n<br />\ntion. Two questions are being<br />\nasked: should the Chaplain's Office or the Chaplain be involved<br />\nin political issues at all, and is it<br />\nappropriate for the office or the<br />\nindividual to take stands on<br />\npolitical issues? These questions<br />\nare best approached from a<br />\nreligious perspective.<br />\nIn the Hebrew and Christian<br />\nscriptures, two major themes<br />\nemerge on these topics. First, in<br />\nthe Biblical tradition the religious<br />\nand the secular are not two<br />\nseparate worlds. The world is one<br />\nworld and the Bible is an earthy,<br />\nthis-worldly record of a people's<br />\nexperience of the Holy in history,<br />\nthrough concrete social, political,<br />\nand interpersonal events and<br />\nstruggles. God meets us in this<br />\nworld, chooses to be known in<br />\nthis world, empowers us to act in<br />\nthis world, and calls us to be cocreators, transforming this world<br />\nin accordance with divine ideals<br />\nof justice and mercy.<br />\nFaith is not concerned only<br />\nwith those things we describe as<br />\nspiritual, pious or supernatural,<br />\nonly with ritual and doctrine.

Taught by a lawyer, the course will<br />\ncompare the legal concepts of the world's oldest know systems with those of<br />\nmodern law.<br />\n130.452-453 Modern Hebrew Literature M3, W9, 3 credits, Instructor: Dr.<br />\nlwry<br />\nThis course will start off with a series of preliminary exercises designed to<br />\ntrain the students in the art of close reading and analyzing of Modern<br />\nHebrew texts, accessible short stories, excerpts from popular novellas, or<br />\n*ridged pieces from current periodicals. The main target of the course will<br />\nbe the perusal of a limited selection of writings by S.J. Angon, the Nobel<br />\nPrize Laureate of Hebrew Literature. This will include some of his<br />\nautobiographical stories, his traditional epic narratives, and a couple of his<br />\nwonder tales of a surrealistic nature. Similarly, for the sake of comparative<br />\norientation, one or two items 1-Nrm contemporary Israeli writers, such as A.B.<br />\nYehoshua and Amos Oz, will be included.<br />\nAll through the course, which will be conducted in Hebrew, emphasis will be<br />\ngiven to the phenomena of style and grammatical construction, thematic con-<br />\n<br />\ntext, and the characteristic milieu of the works selected. To improve the<br />\nquality of speaking and writing skills, a few summaries or short compositions<br />\nplus a limited amount of weekly reading will be requested.<br />\n130.470 Arabic I MTW 10, 3 credits, Instructor: Dr. Krotkoff<br />\nThis is probably the last time that Arabic will be offered at JHU in Baltimore.<br />\nThis introductory language course is taught during both semesters of the<br />\nacademic year, and according to University regulations credit is given only to<br />\nthose who enroll for both terms. Arabic is not a homogenous language, and<br />\nwe distinguish between Classical, Modern Literary, and numerous local vernaculars. The latter are used in everyday conversation, but only the literary<br />\n(aka MSA 5 Modern Standard Arabic) is the same for the entire Arab world<br />\nand considered fit for writing. It is, therefore advisable to start with MSA.<br />\nLearning Arabic , barring some ulterior motivations, should be taken as an<br />\nintellectual exercise and adventure. Learners must accept that there is more<br />\nthan one *ay of expressing thought and agree to acquire a set of rules different from that of their own language, including a completely new script.<br />\nThose who know their own language well and who have given language<br />\nsome thought before will be at an advantage. The instruction will concentrate<br />\non reading, grammatical analysis, translation, structure, semantics, and<br />\ncultural differences. A professor-published study aid and a dictionary must<br />\nbe acquired. Interest and continuous preparedness in class are the most important conditions for success. . , ,<br />\n132.600-601 Elementary Akkadian, 4 credits TBA, Instructor: Dr. Westbrook<br />\nThe language of ancient Babylonia and Assyria, written in cuneiform script.<br />\nMastery of the language and script presents an unusual challenge to the student who is not looking for a soft option.

In the past it<br />\nhas been up to students to find out<br />\nabout the program. \"I discovered<br />\nit while leafing through the<br />\nundergraduate catalog,\" said<br />\nKim.<br />\nIt wasn't until last semester that<br />\nthe Honors Board decided to actively recruit students. You might<br />\nwonder why they waited until<br />\nnow to publicize the program.<br />\nAccording to Brigette Gerl, a<br />\ngraduate student in Humanities,<br />\nthere are less than ten students<br />\n<br />\ncurrently involved, and \"with the<br />\ncurrent financial situation, we<br />\ncouldn't justify a program having<br />\nso few participants.\"<br />\nWhile the Board's primary<br />\nsource for recruitment is the GPA<br />\nlist of sophomores in the social<br />\nsciences and humanities, Gerl<br />\nsays \"interested science majors<br />\nwho have taken enough<br />\nhumanities courses are welcome<br />\nto apply. We want students who<br />\nwork<br />\nto<br />\nwilling<br />\nare<br />\nindependently.\"<br />\nThe application process is<br />\nlengthy, but fairly straightforward. Candidates should find two<br />\n'professors in humanities that are<br />\nwilling to advise them through the<br />\n40- to 100-page honors essay that<br />\nrepresents the culmination of the<br />\nprogram. \"At least one of the advisors must be a professor with<br />\nwhom the student has taken a<br />\nclass,\" Gerl stresses, but even<br />\nwith the proposed faculty reduction, she doesn't feel that student<br />\ninterest will exceed the amdunt of<br />\navailable advisors. Kim found the<br />\nfaculty \"very supportive of<br />\nstudents that show an interest.\"<br />\nAlthough the Board prefers<br />\nstudents with Honors-level<br />\nGPAs, Gerl stresses that \"There<br />\nis no strict rule. If they have great<br />\ngrades in humanities, we're not<br />\nworried about slightly lower<br />\ngrades in courses that cldn't concern us.\" Focus is placed on the<br />\ntwo required faculty recommendations and on the project proposal, which should be well-<br />\n<br />\nwritten and demonstrate the student's seriousness of purpose.<br />\nFollowing application and,<br />\nideally, acceptance into the program at the end of the sophomore<br />\nyear or at the beginning of the<br />\njunior year, \"most honors candidates take an independent study<br />\nper term, and in exceptional<br />\ncases, two,\" says Gerl. In addition, it is strongly suggested that<br />\nstudents take classes offered by<br />\ntheir advisor; however, the pro-<br />\n<br />\ngrams can be individually designed at the discretion of the student and his or her advisor. Some<br />\nstudents choose to include a<br />\njunior year abroad (through the<br />\nOffice of Academic Advising)for<br />\nsummer travel and study, for<br />\nwhich some funding is available<br />\nthrough the Rose Traveling<br />\nFellowship.<br />\nBut is all this extra work really<br />\nworth it? Kim, who hopes to<br />\nwrite a thesis that will qualify him<br />\n<br />\nfor the combined bachelor's and<br />\nmaster's degree, seems to think<br />\nso. \"It's the best way for me to<br />\ndecide whether I want to attend<br />\ngraduate school.

Do the<br />\nmuses smile favorably on those<br />\nwho live on streets lined with<br />\ntrees and lawns? According to<br />\ntwenty-one year old Nova Scotian<br />\nSara McLachlan, whose debut<br />\nalbum, Touch, came out about a<br />\nmonth ago, the explanation is<br />\nsimple: there's not a hell of a lot<br />\nelse to do in Halifax, and starting<br />\na band is as good a way as any<br />\nto inject a little adrenalin into an<br />\notherwise placid life.<br />\nMcLachlan knows from experience. At age 17, she and her<br />\nband October Game were opening a show at the local university<br />\nfor Moev, a Canadian group signed to a Vancouver-based record<br />\nlabel, Nettwerk. Moev's guitarist<br />\n(and head of Nettwerk's A&R<br />\ndepartment) was so impressed by<br />\nSarah's powerful soprano that he<br />\ninvited the teenager to come to<br />\nVancouver to cut a few demos.<br />\nSarah's parents, in her own<br />\nwords, \"freaked,\" and absolute-<br />\n<br />\nly refused to give their permission. Understandably disappointed, but obedient, she continued on in Halifax. She entered<br />\nart college, where she hoped to<br />\nbecome an illustrator and fashion<br />\ndesigner. She kept in periodic<br />\ncontact with her would-be<br />\nbenefactors, but nobody expected<br />\nanything to come of it.<br />\nMcLachlan certainly wasn't expecting it. \"When I was 19,<br />\nTerry McBride, the president [of<br />\nNettwerk], came to Halifax with<br />\nthe band and offered me a fiverecord contract out of the blue,\"<br />\nshe explains, still struck by her<br />\ngood fortune. McLachlan clearly values the patience Nettwerk<br />\nshowed by waiting those two<br />\ncrucial years. Whether by contract or company policy, she<br />\nseems to enjoy complete creative<br />\ncontrol as well. Being signed to<br />\nNettwerk, best known for their<br />\nwild industrial dance music, and<br />\nhaving a pressing and distribution<br />\ndeal with a major label (Arista)<br />\nis possibly the ideal arrangement<br />\n\u2022 for a young independent-minded<br />\nmusician like McLachlan.<br />\nCreative control with corporate<br />\nsupport is a major achievement<br />\nthese days. McLachlan, like<br />\nothers of her generation,<br />\nunderstands the realities of the<br />\nmusic business and the need for<br />\nself-determination. She doesn't,<br />\nfor example, tolerate the kind of<br />\nart-department packaging that<br />\npasses for personality for so many<br />\nsexpot disco divas.

Of the<br />\ncreative process, McLachlan expreses a classic conflict. \"I know<br />\nhow I want it, how it should end,<br />\nbut getting it there is not the easy<br />\npart.

Violinists Piotr Buczek and<br />\nJerzy Kaplanek, violist Adam<br />\nSmyla, and cellist Zbiimiew<br />\nSzoltysek brought their tightly<br />\nwoven sound and perfectly matched intonation to several different contemporary pieces and<br />\nselections from the early<br />\nrepertoire.<br />\nGrazyna Bacewicz's \"String<br />\n<br />\nHomewood Friends Meeting.

High scorers for<br />\nthe Jays were sophomore Kathy<br />\n<br />\nHerring(4 goals, 1 assist), Junior<br />\nPatty Lagator(4 goals, 1 assist),<br />\nand,Senior Kathy Hart(3 goals).<br />\nAccording to Lagator, \"The<br />\nwhole team played well.\"<br />\nIt was a different story<br />\nWednesday afternoon when the<br />\nBlue Jays took the road to play<br />\nMary Washington College.<br />\nDespite winning the tough grass<br />\ngame, Hopkins did not play up to<br />\ntheir characteristic high level of<br />\nskill. \"We weren't sharp,\" stated<br />\nCoach Sally Beth Anderson.<br />\n\"We didn't get out feet moving<br />\n*until late in the game.\"<br />\nThe Jays lost almost every<br />\ndraw (comparable to the face-off<br />\nin men's lacrosse), and consequently came up with few possessions. \"We wouldn't have had<br />\nmuch of a problem with (Mary<br />\nWashington) had we come up<br />\nwith the draw,\" said Anderson.<br />\nWith the halftime score of 5-4,<br />\n<br />\ngoals went back and forth until<br />\nLagator netted an unassisted goal<br />\nwith 4:26 left in the game to pull<br />\nthe Jays ahead 10-9. A pass from<br />\nHerring to sophomore Tara<br />\nFrame with 57 seconds remaining resulted in the goal that clinched the game for Hopkins and<br />\nleft the final score at 11-9. Cole<br />\nhad eleven saves on the<br />\nafternoon.<br />\nThe slight two-goal difference<br />\nin the victory over Mary<br />\nWashington hurt the Jays against<br />\na much weaker NCAA South<br />\nteam. Hopkins remains in a threeway tie in the MAC West Division with Western Maryland and<br />\nWashington Colleges.

He was the<br />\nquarterback for the 1988 Hopkins<br />\nfootball team, and despite battling injuries his entire senior<br />\nseason, came back to lead the<br />\nJays over Western Maryland in<br />\nthe season finale.<br />\n\"Football has had its ups and<br />\ndowns. The only major change<br />\nhas been in our record. There are<br />\nmore changes going on in the<br />\nother teams we play. Some teams<br />\nhave made major changes in their<br />\nprogram while Hopkins has made<br />\nsome minor changes.<br />\n\"Next year, the team could<br />\neither do really well or the same<br />\nas this past season. Because a lot<br />\n<br />\nof guys will be graduating, there<br />\nwill be a lot of inexperience at<br />\nmany key positions. It's going to<br />\nbe up to the team to pick up the<br />\nslack. If they do that, they'll have<br />\na good season.<br />\n\"A definite plus is the fact that<br />\nCoach Pfeifer recruits a lot of<br />\ngreat athletes. For instance, my<br />\nsophomore year we had ten<br />\nquarterbacks in camp. Now, two<br />\nplay linebacker, one plays defensive back, and another plays wide<br />\nreceiver. We have linebackers<br />\nwho switched to offensive<br />\nlinemen. It helps to have so many<br />\ngreat athletes.<br />\n\"The defense is always good,<br />\nand that's because Coach Babb<br />\nalways does a good job. And<br />\nwhen it comes to designing plays,<br />\nCoach Pfeifer is very smart. Like<br />\nI said before, it's up to the players<br />\nthemselves next year.\"<br />\nAfter playing football for four<br />\nyears, Rupert has both good and<br />\nbad memories. \"The Dickinson<br />\ngame two years ago was great.<br />\nWe were losing going into the<br />\nfourth quarter, and yet we won.<br />\nAfter that, we walked into the<br />\nBull Roast, and nobody would<br />\nbelieve that we had won because<br />\nthey all left the game early to go<br />\neat.<br />\n\"One thing I'd like to forget is<br />\ngetting hurt. I've been injured<br />\nevery year I've played. No matter who the team is, everyone is<br />\nout to get the quarterback. So I'd<br />\nget cheap shots taken at me all the<br />\ntime, usually after I'd released the<br />\nball. After that, moving around<br />\nthe house the next day was painful. Sometimes, I wouldn't be<br />\n<br />\nable to practice until the following Wednesday.<br />\n\"I chose Hopkins for its<br />\nacademics and name. People are<br />\nalways impressed with Hopkins<br />\ngraduates. I've enjoyed it, and<br />\nbecause of it, I've done a lot of<br />\nother things and made many<br />\nfriends for life.<br />\n\"But people [at Hopkins] need<br />\nto relax a little more and just have<br />\nfun. There's nothing wrong with<br />\ncoming to watch the football team<br />\non a Saturday afternoon,<br />\nregardless of whether or not the<br />\nteam wins. I know people here<br />\nwho'll sit and watch the<br />\nhometown pro-football team lose<br />\n50-0 on TV on Sunday, and yet<br />\nthey won't come up on a Saturday to watch our game.<br />\n\"Good crowds would definitely help at football games. You get<br />\nmore pumped up playing before<br />\na noisy crowd. Nobody went to<br />\nthe basketball games until the end<br />\nof the season when they were<br />\nwinning, except for someone like<br />\nMr. Scott. He's done a really<br />\ngood job.

The seminar was given<br />\nfree by Citizens Against Crime,<br />\na private national safety organization that has forty offices across<br />\nthe country.<br />\nJulie Beckman, regional director of Citizens Against Crime and<br />\nthe seminar leader, began by asking, \"Do I have to convince you<br />\nthat crime is a problem?\" She<br />\nwent on to say that always<br />\nremembering that crime is a problem is the first step in preventing it from occurring.<br />\n\"Everybody has the potential to<br />\nbe a victim,\" she said. \"Once<br />\nyou believe that, you heighten<br />\nyour awareness and immediately<br />\ndecrease the chances that it will<br />\nbe you.\"<br />\nDuring the short, informative<br />\nseminar, Beckman pointed out<br />\nmany common sense tips that<br />\napply directly to students and can<br />\nbe employed to avoid becoming<br />\na victim. But first, she suggested<br />\na look at the criminal's perspective: \"Criminals do not strike at<br />\nrandom. They are looking for<br />\nvictims who are quick, easy, and<br />\nno risk.\" To reduce the chances<br />\nof being a victim, she said,\"You<br />\nneed to give a criminal a reason<br />\nto pass you by.\"<br />\nBeckman suggested that<br /><br />\nNews-Letter file<br /><br />\nSecurity director Robert Larkin said freshmen and other new students<br />\nshould be aware of their own security needs as soon as they arrive.<br />\nstudents walk confidently and<br />\nwith purpose, pay attention at all<br />\ntimes, and make eye contact with<br />\npeople on the street. If approached and threatened, students<br />\nshould go ahead and give money<br />\nor something of value rather than<br />\nput their well-being in jeopardy.<br />\nBeckman advised against<br />\nfighting in most cases, but said,<br />\n\"If you fight, fight to incapacitate, and use distance and<br />\nthe element of surprise to your<br />\nadvantage.\"<br />\n\"It's all about having a plan.\"<br />\nThis is Beckman's\u2014and many<br />\nsafety seminars'\u2014basic message.<br /><br />\nThough most of the tips are simple and seem obvious, talking<br />\nabout them, reemphasizing them,<br />\nand offering a different perspective raises awareness and ideally<br />\nencourages students to have in<br />\ntheir minds a smart way to handle difficult situations.<br />\nWhat, then, about students who<br />\ndo not \"have a plan\"?

However,<br />\nmany students do not take the<br />\ntime to attend a safety seminar<br />\nduring their time at Hopkins,<br />\neven though some come to<br />\nBaltimore totally unprepared for<br />\nHopkins's urban setting.<br />\nMany persons assume that<br />\nstudents receive all the information and training they need during the Orientation program, but<br />\nthat is not always so. As Perry explained, students receive security manuals when they arrive, and<br />\nthat her office tries to stress<br />\nrepeatedly some instructions on<br />\nthe major points of safety around<br />\nthe dorms, which include locking<br />\nboth individual and outside doors.<br />\nSecurity meetings are supposed to be held within each dorm.<br />\nYet Larkin reported that this year<br />\nHopkins Security met with only<br />\na few groups of freshmen, and<br />\nadded that most security information sessions held here are poorly attended. \"We can't get to the<br />\nfreshmen,\" he said.<br />\nLarkin emphasized the importance of informing freshmen early, before their living habits are<br />\nformed, so that common sense<br />\nand basic security measures can<br />\nbecome part of their natural indoctrination to Hopkins. Larkin<br />\nalso expressed regret that, under<br />\ncurrent programs, many students<br />\nare not contacted at all, particularly first-year grad students,<br /><br />\ncommuter students, and transfer<br />\nstudents. These are students who<br />\ndo not participate in Orientation<br />\nbut may come to Baltimore unprepared for the urban setting.<br />\nSusan Boswell, dean of<br />\nstudents, offers a balanced<br />\nperspective on the dual responsibilities of the student and the administration with regard to taking<br />\nmeasures to ensure an adequate<br />\nlevel of security.<br />\n\"I think that students need to<br />\ntake some responsibility for<br />\nthemselves and each other, and to<br />\ndo what they can to enhance their<br />\nown personal security,\" she said.<br />\n\"The main role of the administration, on the other hand, is to raise<br />\npeople's consciousness about the<br />\nrealities of living in a city.<br />\n\"That is not to say, however,<br />\nthat campus security has no<br />\nresponsibility,\" said Boswell. \"I<br />\nthink there's a real and genuine<br />\nconcern on the part of administration about the safety of students.\"<br />\nBoswell noted various efforts<br />\nthat the administration has taken<br />\nto enhance the safety of students,<br />\nincluding the regular sponsorship<br />\nof self-defense workshops and,<br />\nmore recently, a series of three<br />\nseminars on personal safety held<br />\nin conjunction with the Baltimore<br />\nPolice Department.<br />\nIn addition, Hopkins Campus<br />\nSecurity provides a variety of services of which many students are<br />\neither unaware or do not take full<br />\nadvantage. These include:<br />\n*Foot escorts in the immediate<br /><br />\narea around campus from 5 p.m.<br />\nto 6 a.m.<br />\n*Free use of an engraving tool,<br />\nwhich students can use to etch<br />\ntheir social security number on<br />\nvalubles such as stereos and<br />\ntelevisions so that the items can<br />\nbe traced by the Federal Bureau<br />\nof Investigation should they get<br />\nstolen.<br />\n*The availability of Krypton<br />\nbike locks, which Security considers the most secure, at cost for<br />\n$16 (they usually sell for over<br />\n$35);<br />\n*Escort van service, which<br />\noperates within a mile radius of<br />\nthe Hopkins campus daily between 5 p.m. and 2 a.m., and<br />\n*Twenty-four hour on-call service, at x7777, in case of an<br />\nemergency.<br />\nCampus security will also<br />\npatrol an office or lab when<br />\nstudents or staff are working late<br />\ninto the evening, both for safety<br />\nand because the potential for accidents occurring in a lab can be<br />\nhigh. In extreme circumstances<br />\nwhen the student has no recourse,<br />\ncampus patrol can pick up a<br />\nstranded student from as far away<br />\nas Towson State University or<br />\nGoucher College.<br />\n\"We're not here just to write<br />\ntickets,\" said Dara D'Adio, a<br />\ncampus security officer. \"I want<br />\nstudents here to realize that they<br />\nare my boss, and that I work for<br />\nthem. I want them to call on me<br />\nwhenever they need me for<br />\nwhatever reason.\"<br /><br />\nNews-Letter file<br /><br />\nDean of Students Susan Boswell said students should take more responsibility for their own security.<br />\nThe Hopkins Security employs<br />\ntwenty-seven full-time security<br />\nofficers, many of whom, like<br />\nD'Adio, are graduates of police<br />\nacademies and have worked as<br />\nregular city police. Although they<br />\nare not allowed to carry guns,<br />\ncampus security officers do have<br />\npowers of arrest, and search and<br />\nseizure.<br />\nLarkin noted that while the rate<br />\nof Baltimore crime has gone up,<br />\nthe rate of crimes committed on<br />\ncampus has, as a whole, declined.<br />\nTempesta attributes the relative<br />\nsecurity of the area surrounding<br />\nHomewood to the high visibility<br />\nof the Baltimore street police.<br />\n\"The police here take an active<br />\npursuit in the safety of<br />\nresidents,\" said Tempesta.\"We<br />\nget visits from police even when<br />\nthey're not on duty.\"<br /><br />\nOrin Hughes, a Hopkins<br />\nsecurity officer, believes the<br />\nquality of security around the area<br />\ncan be strengthened by two<br />\nelements: students input and suggestions; and campus security's<br />\nclose working relationship with<br />\nthe Baltimore Police Department.<br />\n\"It is remarkable that our student body cooperates so well and<br />\nso consistently with the security<br />\noffice in terms of feedback and<br />\nsuggestions,\" said Hughes.<br />\n\"Many of the ideas of students<br />\nwere implemented. For example,<br />\nthe escort van was made available<br />\nat the suggestion of several<br />\nstudents.<br />\n\"We also work hand and glove<br />\nwith the Baltimore Police,\" continued Hughes. \"I think it's best<br />\nwhen all parties concerned work<br />\ntogether.\"<br /><br />\nHOPPY HOUR<br />\nFriday, April 21<br />\nGlass Pavilion<br />\n4:30,=A7:00<br />\nFeaturing This Week:<br /><br />\nANDY MOFFITT<br />\nLOU GIANGIULIO<br />\nCo-sponsored by the Blue Key Society and FSI<br />\nOn Wednesday, May 3 there will be College Night at Memorial Stadium<br />\nwith the Orioles vs. the California Angels.

It may be<br />\nuseful if I address some of the<br />\nconcerns that have been raised.<br />\nThe Chaplain's Office fills<br />\nmany roles. We coordinate<br />\nvolunteer projects for students,<br />\noffer interfaith services, counseling, weddings, and Bible study<br />\nand discussion groups, and sponsor a variety of educational programs, including academic<br />\ncourses, lectures, plays,<br />\nworkshops, and forums. We provide a home for several student<br />\ngroups, and opportunities for<br />\nmembers of the Hopkins community to become involved in the<br />\nlarger community, through local<br />\nchurches and organizations and<br />\nthrough projects with a national<br />\nor international focus.<br />\nThe programs that have been<br />\ncontroversial take up a relatively<br />\nsmall portion of our energy. Yet<br />\nthey are important. In addition to<br />\nits other functions, the Chaplain's<br />\nOffice has traditionally provided<br />\na forum for the expression of<br />\nalternative views and positions<br /><br />\nwhich challenge accepted<br />\n\"truths.\" This remains a vital<br />\naspect of what we do. The conventional voices are heard<br />\nthroughout our society and our<br />\nUniversity. We are enriched by<br />\nbringing alternative voices to<br />\ncampus so that we can learn from<br />\nthose outside the mainstream of<br />\nour social, political, and religious<br />\ninstitutions. We will not all agree<br />\nwith the views presented. Some<br />\nideas will be disturbing and uncomfortable. But we need these<br />\nalternative voices to encourage us<br />\nto look beyond our accepted ways<br />\nof thinking. Doung so is essential<br />\nin a university whose purpose is<br />\nnot merely to transmit the<br />\nestablished truth, but to create<br />\nnew truths by questioning the old.<br />\nIf we are unable or unwilling to<br />\nhear those who challenge our<br />\nbeliefs and the norms of our<br />\nsociety, we will be unable to envision and create a more just and<br />\nhumane world. We will all be<br />\npoorer\u2014intellectually, morally,<br />\nand spiritually.<br />\nThe issue which has emerged<br />\nas the center of concern is that of<br />\nthe proper relation between<br />\nreligion and social/political ac-<br /><br />\ntion. Two questions are being<br />\nasked: should the Chaplain's Office or the Chaplain be involved<br />\nin political issues at all, and is it<br />\nappropriate for the office or the<br />\nindividual to take stands on<br />\npolitical issues? These questions<br />\nare best approached from a<br />\nreligious perspective.<br />\nIn the Hebrew and Christian<br />\nscriptures, two major themes<br />\nemerge on these topics. First, in<br />\nthe Biblical tradition the religious<br />\nand the secular are not two<br />\nseparate worlds. The world is one<br />\nworld and the Bible is an earthy,<br />\nthis-worldly record of a people's<br />\nexperience of the Holy in history,<br />\nthrough concrete social, political,<br />\nand interpersonal events and<br />\nstruggles. God meets us in this<br />\nworld, chooses to be known in<br />\nthis world, empowers us to act in<br />\nthis world, and calls us to be cocreators, transforming this world<br />\nin accordance with divine ideals<br />\nof justice and mercy.<br />\nFaith is not concerned only<br />\nwith those things we describe as<br />\nspiritual, pious or supernatural,<br />\nonly with ritual and doctrine.

The<br />\nclass will read together this brief, but very significant, part of the Bible. As<br />\nneeded, the instructor will direct students to other works that are useful in<br />\nunderstanding Genesis, and in a broader sense, the whole of the Jewish and<br />\nChristian scriptures. Students will do the reading described above in close<br />\nconnection with writing a generous number of essays. The instructor and the<br />\nclass will work together at the various stages of writing about the Bible, including such processes as choosing a topic, adopting a point of view,<br />\ngathering information, outlining, writing, and revision.

Main topics: sources of law, property and family law, contract and debt,<br />\ncrime and tort, constitutional and international law. Required reading consists<br />\nmainly of original sources in translation. Taught by a lawyer, the course will<br />\ncompare the legal concepts of the world's oldest know systems with those of<br />\nmodern law.<br />\n130.452-453 Modern Hebrew Literature M3, W9, 3 credits, Instructor: Dr.<br />\nlwry<br />\nThis course will start off with a series of preliminary exercises designed to<br />\ntrain the students in the art of close reading and analyzing of Modern<br />\nHebrew texts, accessible short stories, excerpts from popular novellas, or<br />\n*ridged pieces from current periodicals. The main target of the course will<br />\nbe the perusal of a limited selection of writings by S.J. Angon, the Nobel<br />\nPrize Laureate of Hebrew Literature. This will include some of his<br />\nautobiographical stories, his traditional epic narratives, and a couple of his<br />\nwonder tales of a surrealistic nature. Similarly, for the sake of comparative<br />\norientation, one or two items 1-Nrm contemporary Israeli writers, such as A.B.<br />\nYehoshua and Amos Oz, will be included.<br />\nAll through the course, which will be conducted in Hebrew, emphasis will be<br />\ngiven to the phenomena of style and grammatical construction, thematic con-<br /><br />\ntext, and the characteristic milieu of the works selected. To improve the<br />\nquality of speaking and writing skills, a few summaries or short compositions<br />\nplus a limited amount of weekly reading will be requested.<br />\n130.470 Arabic I MTW 10, 3 credits, Instructor: Dr. Krotkoff<br />\nThis is probably the last time that Arabic will be offered at JHU in Baltimore.<br />\nThis introductory language course is taught during both semesters of the<br />\nacademic year, and according to University regulations credit is given only to<br />\nthose who enroll for both terms. Arabic is not a homogenous language, and<br />\nwe distinguish between Classical, Modern Literary, and numerous local vernaculars. The latter are used in everyday conversation, but only the literary<br />\n(aka MSA 5 Modern Standard Arabic) is the same for the entire Arab world<br />\nand considered fit for writing. It is, therefore advisable to start with MSA.<br />\nLearning Arabic , barring some ulterior motivations, should be taken as an<br />\nintellectual exercise and adventure. Learners must accept that there is more<br />\nthan one *ay of expressing thought and agree to acquire a set of rules different from that of their own language, including a completely new script.<br />\nThose who know their own language well and who have given language<br />\nsome thought before will be at an advantage. The instruction will concentrate<br />\non reading, grammatical analysis, translation, structure, semantics, and<br />\ncultural differences. A professor-published study aid and a dictionary must<br />\nbe acquired. Interest and continuous preparedness in class are the most important conditions for success. . , ,<br />\n132.600-601 Elementary Akkadian, 4 credits TBA, Instructor: Dr. Westbrook<br />\nThe language of ancient Babylonia and Assyria, written in cuneiform script.<br />\nMastery of the language and script presents an unusual challenge to the student who is not looking for a soft option.

You might<br />\nwonder why they waited until<br />\nnow to publicize the program.<br />\nAccording to Brigette Gerl, a<br />\ngraduate student in Humanities,<br />\nthere are less than ten students<br /><br />\ncurrently involved, and \"with the<br />\ncurrent financial situation, we<br />\ncouldn't justify a program having<br />\nso few participants.\"<br />\nWhile the Board's primary<br />\nsource for recruitment is the GPA<br />\nlist of sophomores in the social<br />\nsciences and humanities, Gerl<br />\nsays \"interested science majors<br />\nwho have taken enough<br />\nhumanities courses are welcome<br />\nto apply. We want students who<br />\nwork<br />\nto<br />\nwilling<br />\nare<br />\nindependently.\"<br />\nThe application process is<br />\nlengthy, but fairly straightforward. Candidates should find two<br />\n'professors in humanities that are<br />\nwilling to advise them through the<br />\n40- to 100-page honors essay that<br />\nrepresents the culmination of the<br />\nprogram. \"At least one of the advisors must be a professor with<br />\nwhom the student has taken a<br />\nclass,\" Gerl stresses, but even<br />\nwith the proposed faculty reduction, she doesn't feel that student<br />\ninterest will exceed the amdunt of<br />\navailable advisors. Kim found the<br />\nfaculty \"very supportive of<br />\nstudents that show an interest.\"<br />\nAlthough the Board prefers<br />\nstudents with Honors-level<br />\nGPAs, Gerl stresses that \"There<br />\nis no strict rule. If they have great<br />\ngrades in humanities, we're not<br />\nworried about slightly lower<br />\ngrades in courses that cldn't concern us.\" Focus is placed on the<br />\ntwo required faculty recommendations and on the project proposal, which should be well-<br /><br />\nwritten and demonstrate the student's seriousness of purpose.<br />\nFollowing application and,<br />\nideally, acceptance into the program at the end of the sophomore<br />\nyear or at the beginning of the<br />\njunior year, \"most honors candidates take an independent study<br />\nper term, and in exceptional<br />\ncases, two,\" says Gerl. In addition, it is strongly suggested that<br />\nstudents take classes offered by<br />\ntheir advisor; however, the pro-<br /><br />\ngrams can be individually designed at the discretion of the student and his or her advisor. Some<br />\nstudents choose to include a<br />\njunior year abroad (through the<br />\nOffice of Academic Advising)for<br />\nsummer travel and study, for<br />\nwhich some funding is available<br />\nthrough the Rose Traveling<br />\nFellowship.<br />\nBut is all this extra work really<br />\nworth it? Kim, who hopes to<br />\nwrite a thesis that will qualify him<br /><br />\nfor the combined bachelor's and<br />\nmaster's degree, seems to think<br />\nso. \"It's the best way for me to<br />\ndecide whether I want to attend<br />\ngraduate school.

Or would you? Look at<br />\nsome of the great musical figures<br />\n,who've come out of small towns:<br />\nR.E.M. got started in the college<br />\ntown of Athens, Georgia; the<br />\nMinutemen in San Pedro,<br />\nCalifornia. Elvis was born in<br />\nTupelo, Mississippi, and found<br />\nhis first successes in Kilgore,<br />\nTexas, of all places. Do the<br />\nmuses smile favorably on those<br />\nwho live on streets lined with<br />\ntrees and lawns? According to<br />\ntwenty-one year old Nova Scotian<br />\nSara McLachlan, whose debut<br />\nalbum, Touch, came out about a<br />\nmonth ago, the explanation is<br />\nsimple: there's not a hell of a lot<br />\nelse to do in Halifax, and starting<br />\na band is as good a way as any<br />\nto inject a little adrenalin into an<br />\notherwise placid life.<br />\nMcLachlan knows from experience. At age 17, she and her<br />\nband October Game were opening a show at the local university<br />\nfor Moev, a Canadian group signed to a Vancouver-based record<br />\nlabel, Nettwerk. Moev's guitarist<br />\n(and head of Nettwerk's A&amp;R<br />\ndepartment) was so impressed by<br />\nSarah's powerful soprano that he<br />\ninvited the teenager to come to<br />\nVancouver to cut a few demos.<br />\nSarah's parents, in her own<br />\nwords, \"freaked,\" and absolute-<br /><br />\nly refused to give their permission. Understandably disappointed, but obedient, she continued on in Halifax. She entered<br />\nart college, where she hoped to<br />\nbecome an illustrator and fashion<br />\ndesigner. She kept in periodic<br />\ncontact with her would-be<br />\nbenefactors, but nobody expected<br />\nanything to come of it.<br />\nMcLachlan certainly wasn't expecting it. \"When I was 19,<br />\nTerry McBride, the president [of<br />\nNettwerk], came to Halifax with<br />\nthe band and offered me a fiverecord contract out of the blue,\"<br />\nshe explains, still struck by her<br />\ngood fortune. McLachlan clearly values the patience Nettwerk<br />\nshowed by waiting those two<br />\ncrucial years. Whether by contract or company policy, she<br />\nseems to enjoy complete creative<br />\ncontrol as well. Being signed to<br />\nNettwerk, best known for their<br />\nwild industrial dance music, and<br />\nhaving a pressing and distribution<br />\ndeal with a major label (Arista)<br />\nis possibly the ideal arrangement<br />\n\u2022 for a young independent-minded<br />\nmusician like McLachlan.<br />\nCreative control with corporate<br />\nsupport is a major achievement<br />\nthese days. McLachlan, like<br />\nothers of her generation,<br />\nunderstands the realities of the<br />\nmusic business and the need for<br />\nself-determination. She doesn't,<br />\nfor example, tolerate the kind of<br />\nart-department packaging that<br />\npasses for personality for so many<br />\nsexpot disco divas.

Settled into her apartment<br />\nwith an eight-track recorder,<br />\nkeyboard, and guitar, McLachlan<br />\ntoiled for six months straight,<br />\nleaving home only to pick up supplies at the corner store. Of the<br />\ncreative process, McLachlan expreses a classic conflict. \"I know<br />\nhow I want it, how it should end,<br />\nbut getting it there is not the easy<br />\npart. It takes a long time to get<br />\nit to that point.\"<br />\nSee TOUCH, 14<br /><br />\nPolish Quartet Excels at BMA<br />\nby Willa J. Conrad<br />\nIt doesn't happen often. A<br />\ngroup of talented Polish musicians coming to Baltimore and<br />\npresenting works by 20th-century<br />\ncomposers of the same nationality is simply not an everyday<br />\noccurrence.<br />\nBut last Sunday at the<br />\nBaltimore Museum of Art, the<br />\nPenderecki String Quartet did just<br />\nthat. Violinists Piotr Buczek and<br />\nJerzy Kaplanek, violist Adam<br />\nSmyla, and cellist Zbiimiew<br />\nSzoltysek brought their tightly<br />\nwoven sound and perfectly matched intonation to several different contemporary pieces and<br />\nselections from the early<br />\nrepertoire.<br />\nGrazyna Bacewicz's \"String<br /><br />\nHomewood Friends Meeting.

The quartet's splitsecond timing made the piece's<br />\ninherent rhythmic drive and syncopations exciting. This same<br />\nensemble precision provided a<br />\nfoundation for the contrasting<br />\nlyricism of the third movement,<br />\nwhen sweet snatches of melody<br />\nmoved from part to part.<br />\nWhile Bacewicz was considered to be a gifted composer,<br />\nthe \"String Quartet #3\" does not<br />\ndisplay a unique musical<br />\nlanguage.

With the<br />\nplayful spirit of a child enjoying<br />\nthe noise he can produce with a<br />\nviolin, the composer asks the<br />\nplayers to pluck and strum the<br />\nstrings, tap the wood, and use<br />\nmany unusual bowings for special<br />\neffects. The resulting impression<br />\nis that the instruments are buzzing like insects, yawning, sighing,<br />\nand thumping together.<br />\nThis is not to say that the music<br />\nis in any way infantile.

He was the<br />\nquarterback for the 1988 Hopkins<br />\nfootball team, and despite battling injuries his entire senior<br />\nseason, came back to lead the<br />\nJays over Western Maryland in<br />\nthe season finale.<br />\n\"Football has had its ups and<br />\ndowns. The only major change<br />\nhas been in our record. There are<br />\nmore changes going on in the<br />\nother teams we play. Some teams<br />\nhave made major changes in their<br />\nprogram while Hopkins has made<br />\nsome minor changes.<br />\n\"Next year, the team could<br />\neither do really well or the same<br />\nas this past season. Because a lot<br /><br />\nof guys will be graduating, there<br />\nwill be a lot of inexperience at<br />\nmany key positions. It's going to<br />\nbe up to the team to pick up the<br />\nslack. If they do that, they'll have<br />\na good season.<br />\n\"A definite plus is the fact that<br />\nCoach Pfeifer recruits a lot of<br />\ngreat athletes. For instance, my<br />\nsophomore year we had ten<br />\nquarterbacks in camp. Now, two<br />\nplay linebacker, one plays defensive back, and another plays wide<br />\nreceiver. We have linebackers<br />\nwho switched to offensive<br />\nlinemen. It helps to have so many<br />\ngreat athletes.<br />\n\"The defense is always good,<br />\nand that's because Coach Babb<br />\nalways does a good job. And<br />\nwhen it comes to designing plays,<br />\nCoach Pfeifer is very smart. Like<br />\nI said before, it's up to the players<br />\nthemselves next year.\"<br />\nAfter playing football for four<br />\nyears, Rupert has both good and<br />\nbad memories. \"The Dickinson<br />\ngame two years ago was great.<br />\nWe were losing going into the<br />\nfourth quarter, and yet we won.<br />\nAfter that, we walked into the<br />\nBull Roast, and nobody would<br />\nbelieve that we had won because<br />\nthey all left the game early to go<br />\neat.<br />\n\"One thing I'd like to forget is<br />\ngetting hurt. I've been injured<br />\nevery year I've played. No matter who the team is, everyone is<br />\nout to get the quarterback. So I'd<br />\nget cheap shots taken at me all the<br />\ntime, usually after I'd released the<br />\nball. After that, moving around<br />\nthe house the next day was painful. Sometimes, I wouldn't be<br /><br />\nable to practice until the following Wednesday.<br />\n\"I chose Hopkins for its<br />\nacademics and name. People are<br />\nalways impressed with Hopkins<br />\ngraduates. I've enjoyed it, and<br />\nbecause of it, I've done a lot of<br />\nother things and made many<br />\nfriends for life.<br />\n\"But people [at Hopkins] need<br />\nto relax a little more and just have<br />\nfun. There's nothing wrong with<br />\ncoming to watch the football team<br />\non a Saturday afternoon,<br />\nregardless of whether or not the<br />\nteam wins. I know people here<br />\nwho'll sit and watch the<br />\nhometown pro-football team lose<br />\n50-0 on TV on Sunday, and yet<br />\nthey won't come up on a Saturday to watch our game.<br />\n\"Good crowds would definitely help at football games. You get<br />\nmore pumped up playing before<br />\na noisy crowd. Nobody went to<br />\nthe basketball games until the end<br />\nof the season when they were<br />\nwinning, except for someone like<br />\nMr. Scott. He's done a really<br />\ngood job. He shows up at every<br />\ngame for all sports here. He<br />\nknows all the athletes by name<br />\nand congratulates them after<br />\nevery game. He always show his<br />\nsupport.
