The<br />\nPresident briefly touched on the<br />\nfinancial condition of the<br />\nUniversity, the size of the<br />\ngraduate and iundergraduate<br />\nstudent bodies, the scope of the<br />\nhousing problem and<br />\nadministrative priorities.<br />\nRegarding the budgetary<br />\ndifficulties of the last few years,<br />\nMuller said, \"we are doing<br />\nbetter.\" Adding that it had not<br />\nbeen easy to come from a $5<br />\nmillion deficit three iears ago,<br />\nMuller expressed optimism over<br />\nthe budget for 1973-74. \"I think<br />\nWe'll have a balanced budget and<br />\nthat we can keep a balanced<br />\nbudget for the future with some<br />\nluck and good management.\"<br />\nMuller asserted that even<br />\nthough the University had been<br />\nforced to curtail some amenities,<br />\nit is still academically sound and<br />\nthat it can be kept sound while a<br />\nbalanced budget is maintained.<br />\nMuller said that the University,<br />\nto maintain this balance, needed<br />\nnot only the support from public<br />\n<br />\nfunds, but also those from the<br />\nalumni.<br />\nAddressing himself to more<br />\ngeneral matters, the President<br />\nstated quite frankly that<br />\n\"Hopkins should not pretend to<br />\n,be a purely undergraduate<br />\ninstitution.\" Muller contended<br />\nthat the University \"does a good<br />\njob\", but that people must<br />\nremember that the school is for a<br />\nsmall clientele and that Hopkins<br />\nis not a big undergraduate<br />\ncampus.<br />\n\u2022<br />\nSpeaking about<br />\nundergraduates in general, Muller<br />\ncommented that an \"increase in<br />\nthe size of the student body<br />\nwould not be wise, primarily<br />\nbecause we just don't have the<br />\nfacilities.\" The President<br />\npredicted that in three to four<br />\nyears the student body would<br />\nreach a roughly stable level. \"I<br />\nthink that at that time we will<br />\nsee close to 700 coeds in an<br />\nundergraduate body of just over<br />\n2,000,\" he stated.<br />\nMuller additionally cautioned<br />\nthat it is \"an illusion\" to think<br />\nthat tuition costs could be<br />\nreduced by merely increasing the<br />\nsize of the student body. He<br />\nbased this remark on the fact<br />\nthat even at present, the tuition<br />\nnow paid by undergraduates only<br />\ncovers half the cost of their<br />\neducation.<br />\nCommenting on the faculty of<br />\nthe University, Muller remarked,<br />\n\"We have a good faculty now and<br />\n<br />\nNew transfer students<br />\nfollow normal trend<br />\nj<br />\ni<br />\n<br />\nBy RICHARD BLAND<br />\nOnly six new students have<br />\ntransferred to Hopkins this<br />\nsemester.<br />\nAccording to Glen A.

He<br />\n\u2022 noted that<br />\nabout ten of these<br />\nintended to major in the sciences,<br />\nWith most of the rest in the<br />\nh umanities.<br />\nThe admissions office also<br />\ni ndicated<br />\nthat there was less<br />\ne mphasis now upon the<br />\nadmission of women transfer<br />\nstudents than there had been<br />\nWhen women first came to<br />\nHopkins in 1970.<br />\nDistribution Goes<br />\nOf the six new transfer<br />\nstudents,<br />\nfour are women. The<br />\nclass distribution goes as follows:<br />\n<br />\none freshman, two sophomores<br />\nand three juniors. The six are<br />\nenrolled in either social sciences<br />\nor humanities.<br />\nThomas attributed a yearly<br />\nrise of transfer enrollment to \"a<br />\nsubstantial increase among<br />\nstudents wanting to transfer.\"<br />\nHe also commented that each<br />\napplicant for transfer was<br />\nscreened \"on an individual<br />\nbasis,\" making interviews an<br />\nintegral part of the application<br />\nprocedure.<br />\n<br />\nour efforts will be to make it as<br />\nperfect as we can.\" He warned<br />\nthat people should not judge the<br />\nquality of the various<br />\ndepartments purely on their size.<br />\n\"Our departments are going to<br />\nstay small,\" he asserted,\"and we<br />\ncan have good departments (with<br />\nless than 20 people) as long as we<br />\nmaintain a tradition in seeing<br />\nthat every member is as superb<br />\nprofessionally as we can find.\"<br />\nRegarding the current housing<br />\nsituation, Muller stressed that the<br />\nproblem \"is serious.\" He said this<br />\nwas in part due to the fact that<br />\nthe University feels it has an<br />\nobligation to all coeds to offer<br />\nthem university housing and as a<br />\nresult, many undergraduate men<br />\n<br />\nhave been forced to find housing<br />\non their own. While granting that<br />\nit would be difficult to solve the<br />\nproblem in the immediate future,<br />\nMuller did say that the situation<br />\nwould be examined over the<br />\nsummer. \"We are going to try to<br />\nspend a good part of the summer<br />\nworking on a long range solution<br />\nto the housing problem and to<br />\ntake a hard look at the<br />\nneighborhood around<br />\nHomewood,\" he remarked.<br />\nMuller concluded by saying<br />\nthat despite the problems faced<br />\nby Hopkins, \"I have no doubts<br />\nabout the future.\" After a year in<br />\nthe Presidency,\" he commented,<br />\n\"I am fonder of the school now<br />\nthan when I came.\"<br />\n<br />\nGroup seeks infirmary upgrade<br />\nBy ANDREW LASHLEY<br />\nGeneral dissatisfaction with the Student Health<br />\nService on the part of students and administration<br />\nhas led to a pledge of improvement and hints of<br />\ncomplete overhaul from Dean of Students Robert<br />\nFitzpatrick.<br />\n<br />\n\"I'm absolutely committed to getting changes<br />\nand improvements in the Brown Infirmary<br />\nservice,\" said Fitzpatrick. \"A study group<br />\ncomposed of undergraduates and graduate<br />\nstudents has been formed under the Homewood<br />\nAdvisory Council.

He stated that a leader<br />\n\"can advise, propose, adjust,<br />\nexplain, condemn and exhort - he<br />\ncannot control.\"<br />\nMuller spent three years<br />\nWriting his thesis, which appeared<br />\nin February, 1958, and no doubt<br />\nSpent a long time developing<br />\nsome of the ideas in it. Fifteen<br />\nYears later, as he begins his<br />\nsecond year as President of<br />\nHopkins, some of them are still<br />\nevident in what he does and what<br />\nhe says.<br />\nHe is still willing to take risks,<br />\nto do what has not been done<br />\nbefore and to lead, not by force,<br />\nbut by careful planning and<br />\naction.<br />\nWhen he arrived here as<br />\nProvost in April 1971, Hopkins<br />\nwas in serious trouble. There was<br />\nno permanent president, no<br />\nWorthwhile fundraising, and no<br />\n\u00b0Ile office committed to the<br />\nn on-academic life of students. No<br />\n\u00b0Ile administrator was<br />\nresponsible for the nuts and bolts<br />\naoministration of the Homewood<br />\ncampus and oddly, no<br />\nundergraduate had ever been a<br />\nRhodes scholar, as he had been.<br />\nWithin seven months of his<br />\nassuming the presidency, Muller<br />\nChanged all that. Most<br />\nI mportantly, last October, her<br />\nProposed to the Board of<br />\nT rustees, meeting in<br />\nWilliamsburg, Va., that Hopkins<br />\nu ndertake a $200 million<br />\ncentennial capital campaign,<br />\nI ncluding 100 endowed<br />\nProfessorships worth $1 million<br />\neach. He told the Board,\" For<br />\nthe University to ask for one<br />\n.hundred endowed positions for<br />\nIts faculty will be a dramatic<br />\n<br />\nchallenge, and one that will once<br />\nmore turn the eyes of not only<br />\nour own community , but of the<br />\nwhole nation, on us.\"<br />\nHe added,\" We; propose doing<br />\nsomething on a scale no other<br />\nuniversity in this country, or for<br />\nthat matter in the world, has<br />\nattempted to do before.\" The<br />\ncampaign, which is expected to<br />\ntake several years to complete,<br />\nwill be announced formally at<br />\nCommemoration Day February<br />\n22nd.<br />\nAlthough fundraising is one of<br />\nthe chief concerns of any<br />\nuniversity president, Muller has<br />\nnot spent all his time on it during<br />\nhis first year. He has spent<br />\nconsiderable time dealing with<br />\nadministrative problems both in<br />\nthe University and in the<br />\nHospital, of which he became<br />\nPresident on October 1st.<br />\nMost important to students at<br />\nHomewood, Muller fulfilled one<br />\nof the key recommendations of<br />\nlast year's Blue Ribbon Panel on<br />\nUndergraduate Education by<br />\nreviving the position of Dean of<br />\nStudents, which had been<br />\nallowed to lapse following the<br />\ndeath of W. Kelso Morrill in<br />\n1968.<br />\nBut instead of giving the job to<br />\na professor who couldn't quite<br />\nmake it academically, or to a<br />\ncollegiate version of a high school<br />\nguidance counselor, he gave it to<br />\nRobert Fitzpatrick, a Baltimore<br />\nCity Councilman and aide to<br />\nformer Senator Joseph Tydings.<br />\nHe did it in culmination of a<br />\nsurprising episode.<br />\nWhen trouble erupted out of a<br />\nparty at the Phi Gamma Delta<br />\nfraternity house last May, the<br />\nstory was in the Sun and Muller<br />\ncalled Fitzpatrick, who<br />\nrepresents the area around the<br />\nGam house, and asked him what<br />\nhe intended to do about it.<br />\n<br />\nSteven Muller and his wife, Margie greet a guest at his installation<br />\nreception last year. Trustee chairman Robert D.H. Harvey and his<br />\nWife are in the background.<br />\n<br />\nFitzpatrick thought a moment<br />\nand replied, \"It's your problem.<br />\nYou take care of it.\" Soon after,<br />\nFitzpatrick found out that he<br />\nwas to be offered the deanship.<br />\nFew university presidents would<br />\nallow themselves to be in a<br />\nposition where they could be<br />\neasily upstaged by an ambitious<br />\nyoung politician. And in fact,<br />\nFitzpatrick is in the Sunpapers<br />\nand on television more often<br />\nthan Muller is.<br />\nFitzpatrick, with his city post,<br />\nis very free to challenge Muller<br />\nand other University<br />\nadministrators on their decisions<br />\nand policies. He has already done<br />\njust that about the quality of<br />\ncampus food service, especially in<br />\nthe dorm cafeteria.<br />\nMuller moved very shrewdly in<br />\nsome other administrative<br />\nappointments he made soon after<br />\ntaking office. In creating the post<br />\nof Vice President for the<br />\nHomewood Divisions and in<br />\nasking former Dean George<br />\nBenton to fill! it, he<br />\naccomplished two important<br />\nends: first, he centralized what<br />\nhad been an absurd, helter skelter<br />\nadministrative structure-nearly all<br />\nthe administrative offices on the<br />\nHomewood campus which once<br />\nreported to one of three officers<br />\nnow report directly to Vice<br />\n<br />\nPresident Benton; second, he<br />\nforced Benton to work on the<br />\nvery administrative weknesses<br />\nthe former dean had so bitterly<br />\ncriticized during the Gordon<br />\nyears, effectively silencing a very<br />\npowerful and influential critic.<br />\nBenton even found himself with<br />\ntime to teach a course last<br />\nsemester and is often out of town<br />\na day or two a week.<br />\nEqually as clever and as<br />\nnecessary to start his<br />\nadministration effectively, Muller<br />\nreplaced Benton as Dean with Dr.<br />\nGeorge Owen, then chairman of<br />\nthe physics department and a<br />\nleader of the faculty group<br />\nwhich toppled Lincoln Gordon<br />\nfrom the presidency on March<br />\n12, 1971. For Owen, things look<br />\nvery different now from the<br />\nDean's office than they did two<br />\nyears ago from his spot in the<br />\nPhysics department. It is unlikely<br />\nthat Owen would challenge<br />\nMuller as he once challenged<br />\nGordon. Also, the deanship<br />\nOwens now holds is far, less<br />\ninfluential than the one Benton<br />\nheld; many of the dean's<br />\nadministrative responsibilities<br />\nwere shifted away, thus reducing<br />\nthe influence of the job.<br />\nFar less dramatic, but no less<br />\nimportant to the image of<br />\nHopkins, Muller helped obtain a<br />\n<br />\nRhodes scholarship for Senior<br />\nClass President Bud Sheppard,<br />\nwho was certainly well qualified<br />\nfor the honor, both in terms<br />\nof his academic work and his<br />\noutside activities.<br />\nThere is no doubt that Muller<br />\nhas accomplished a lot in his first<br />\nyear, but some students suspect<br />\nhe is only using Hopkins as a<br />\nstepping stone and needs to make<br />\na good record. About that, no<br />\none can be sure, but whatever his<br />\nplans are, nothing can take away<br />\nfrom the sheer quality of his<br />\nadministrative skill.<br />\nDean Owen commented,\"In<br />\nhis first year, he has provided a<br />\nbrilliant display of leadership.<br />\nHe's provided a very positive<br />\nfeeling about this place.\"<br />\nMuller himself would likely be<br />\nmore cautious, for,. he was the<br />\none who wrote that the evolution<br />\nof leadership is seldom<br />\ndramatically clear.\" He would<br />\nprobably say that only -time will<br />\ntell the quality of leadership he<br />\nhas provided.<br />\nEnd of Part I<br />\nThe second part of the series<br />\non Steven Muller and his first<br />\nyear as president of Hopkins will<br />\nappear on Tuesday.<br />\n<br />\n\fTHE HOPKINS<br />\n<br />\nbetter health<br />\n<br />\n.

They had some parties<br />\nand other things, the things I had<br />\nanticipated from college in a general way.<br />\nAnd I know that the fraternity has<br />\nenriched my experience here: My<br />\nsophomore and junior years have been<br />\nenjoyable, but I hated it as a freshman; I<br />\nwas writing away for transfer information<br />\nand that type of things. There was too<br />\nmuch pressure.<br />\nIs this the reason why fraternities exist<br />\nat Hopkins?<br />\nNo, and I don't think the fraternities at<br />\nHopkins are typical. At Southern schools<br />\nthey're usually thought of as being<br />\nconservative bulwarks against the tide of<br />\nliberalism, but Hopkins fraternities are<br />\ndistinct. A lot of people in the dorms are<br />\nusually interested in med school and<br />\nstudying\u2014they already know their<br />\ninterests\u2014while in the fraternities, the<br />\npeople usually aren't so sure about what<br />\nthey want, they're more undecided;<br />\nthey're more interested in people. Too<br />\noften you meet people who are interested<br />\nin you as a brain and not as a<br />\nperson\u2014they're interested in you as an<br />\nachiever.<br />\nI think there's a lot more personal<br />\nresponsibility in a fraternity. In a dorm<br />\nyou don't have to talk to people. If you<br />\nget mad at someone, you can go down<br />\nthe hall to your room and just shut the<br />\ndoor. But in a fraternity house, you can't<br />\nignore someone if you don't get along<br />\nwith him. The thing that holds<br />\nfraternities together at Hopkins is<br />\nfriendships, not structure. ...They're a<br />\nplace for upperclassmen to go. You don't<br />\nthink of upperclassmen going to the<br />\nsnack bar in the dorms.<br />\nWhat about the relationship between<br />\nfraternities and the University? Is it a<br />\nvery hostile thing or is everyone satisfied?<br />\nThis is a pretty big question, and I<br />\ndon't have any real answers. As far as<br />\nrush, the school uses about the same<br />\ntheory that they do for freshmen: they're<br />\nnot trying to be substitute parents. You<br />\nguys do the work, and we (the school)<br />\nwill give you a few guidelines. They try to<br />\ncontrol us at fingertips, in that there is no<br />\nreally firm control.<br />\nWhat can the University threaten as a<br />\nsanction against a fraternity?<br />\nThe school can withdraw recognition<br />\nfrom a House, as it did temporarily with<br />\nPhi Gam. It's questionable what effect<br />\nthat has. No\u2014it can have a lot of effect:<br />\nIt could prevent us from rushing in the<br />\ndorms, and that would be very serious.<br />\nThe sanctions are either all or nothing, so<br />\nmost things get talked out at the personal<br />\nlevel.<br />\nIs this how it should be?<br />\nWell, when Eisenhower was here, there<br />\n<br />\nwas a proposal for the school to build<br />\nfraternity houses, but the fraternities<br />\nwould have been subject to the same rules<br />\nas the dormitories were at that time\u2014the<br />\nsame food plan, parietals, and so on. The<br />\nproposal was voted down at the time, and<br />\nI don't think most fraternities want any<br />\ncontrol now. We like it when the<br />\nUniversity helps us out, but they don't go<br />\nout of their way.<br />\nYou still haven't said whether this is<br />\nthe way the Council on Interfraternity<br />\nAffairs(C.I.A.) thinks it should be.<br />\nI think the consensus is that we really<br />\ndon't want to be controlled by the<br />\nUniversity. The school says do what you<br />\n(the fraternities) want, but we want to<br />\nhelp you. We organize rush at our own<br />\nexpense, but they can come in and try to<br />\ntell us how it should be done.<br />\nHas the school ever disciplined a<br />\nfraternity, outside of the incident with<br />\nPhi Gam this fall, and has the fraternity<br />\ncouncil ever disciplined one of its own<br />\nnipmhorc?<br />\nWell, again need to mention the idea<br />\nEt,a lila!? will come<br />\n<br />\n111<br />\n<br />\noccasionally<br />\n<br />\nto our meetings. They're not tough guys<br />\n<br />\nor hard asses about it. The way it is now,<br />\nFitzpatrick does a good job.<br />\nThe old Inter Fraternity Council was<br />\nalmost defunct last year, and the<br />\nUniversity wanted to meet with all the<br />\nnew fraternity presidents in the spring. So<br />\nwe had a meeting, and we(the C.I.A.)<br />\ntook it over from there. We wanted to<br />\nmake a good impression on the freshmen;<br />\nwe wanted to do something about the<br />\nstereotypes. We operate by unanimous<br />\ndecisions. A seven-to-one or eight-to-one<br />\nvote isn't any good\u2014everything is done<br />\non a unanimous basis.<br />\nAgain, has the fraternity council ever<br />\ndisciplined one of its members?<br />\nNo, there have been any incidents-.<br />\nLet's go back to what the C.I.A. thinks<br />\nits relationship with the University should<br />\nbe. What would be the ideal set up?<br />\n<br />\nIt would be better if there were some<br />\nintermediate steps, not just the all or<br />\nnothing sanctions. Hopkins could help us<br />\nout, for example, with beer kegs. The<br />\nprice of kegs is going up every semester,<br />\nand during rush that involves a lot of<br />\nmoney. There was a proposal for the<br />\nfraternities to be able to get the kegs<br />\nthrough the Grad Club, which has a beer<br />\nlicense, but there were problems and it<br />\nwas delayed and delayed. If the<br />\nUniversity could supply us with that<br />\nservice, it would be doing something for<br />\nus and could eliminate some of the<br />\nresentment that exists. I think all the<br />\nfraternities have this feeling.<br />\nYou're saying that this idea beer keg<br />\nservice would be an example of an<br />\nintermediate type of control by the<br />\nschool?<br />\nYes. If the school didn't like the way<br />\nwe were planning rush, for instance, they<br />\nwould be able to say, all right, no beer.\u2022<br />\nThey could withdraw their service.<br />\nft wpm IflUt 5 uecri puuticiztu a<br />\nvoar hag hp ra the> rp \u2022<br />\nLritiliz<br />\n<br />\nfi<br />\n<br />\nt<br />\n<br />\nt he<br />\n<br />\nfnnr<br />\n<br />\nWI<br />\n<br />\ninn<br />\n<br />\nnorthern<br />\n<br />\nfraternities belong to the neighborhood<br />\nassociation, and all except one of the<br />\nfraternities south of the campus belong to<br />\nthe Charles Village Association. I'm not<br />\nsure about Sig Ep; they may not actually<br />\nbe in Charles Village. TEP and Phi Gam<br />\nhave had a cocktail party for the<br />\nneighbors, and it made a tremendous<br />\ndifference. Before, the neighbors<br />\nprobably saw us as something to be afraid<br />\nof-18 or 20 guys moving into the<br />\nneighborhood and things like that. We're<br />\ndoing as much as we can to get along with<br />\nthem.<br />\nOne real problem we have is with<br />\nnoise. During rush, I think all the houses<br />\nare going to have some problems with<br />\nthis. We're going to have monitors<br />\nououtside each house to try to keep<br />\npeople quiet when they leave. We're<br />\nmaking the effort<br />\n<br />\nBy B.H. COHEN<br />\n(first ofa series)<br />\nWith God on our sides, and the<br />\nspirit of the Lord in our political<br />\nleaders, America will prosper<br />\nforever. This is the spirit which<br />\ngave birth to the Presidential<br />\nPrayer Breakfast, begun in<br />\nFebruary, 1953 when Conrad<br />\nHilton picked up the tab for 400<br />\nof the faithful, including<br />\nPresident Eisenhower and the<br />\nReverend Billy Graham.<br />\nYesterday, I attended the<br />\ntwenty-first annual National<br />\nPrayer Breakfast, sponsored by<br />\nthe weekly prayer groups in the<br />\nSenate and House. I was in the<br />\nGrand Ballroom of the<br />\nWashington Hilton not as a<br />\nreporter, but as an invited guest,<br />\nnominated by Steven Muller to<br />\nhelp represent the University at<br />\nthis momentous event. From<br />\nacross half the Nation, seventy<br />\nstudents had gathered-from the<br />\nNorth Carolina State coed who<br />\nhad run her school's YVP, to a<br />\n<br />\ne7(40.4\"1<br />\n<br />\navid de Afads<br />\n<br />\nGardens is made powerful by \u2022 the brief<br />\nrendition on the piano of a child-like<br />\ntune, while the plain lament of Song for<br />\nMartin is all-too- poignantly felt in the<br />\nunadorned threnody of the harmonica.<br />\nAnd pervading all of this simplicity is<br />\nthe essence of gentleness that is the mood<br />\nof the album. The melodies are soft and<br />\npleasing, as are the lyrics. Even in the<br />\nseveral songs with awkward and<br />\nunpleasant subject matters, those subjects<br />\nare approached with a delicateness that<br />\ngives those songs warmth and innocence.<br />\nThe listener can feel the sadness present<br />\nwhen Miss Collins tells of the suicide of<br />\nMartin, but he can also feel that it is a<br />\nsoft sadness, bound in gentleness,<br />\nunderstanding, and sympathy. The regret<br />\nin Holly Ann is surrounded by love.<br />\nAn exception<br />\nThe only song for which this does not<br />\nhold true is Tom Paxton's The<br />\nHostage.The song is not a bad song,<br />\nbut it is seemingly closer to those rough<br />\nblues of those earlier albums, songs such<br />\nas Pretty Polly and Bird on the Wire .<br />\nHowever, it is by far the shortest piece on<br />\nthe record and thus swallowed up the the<br />\nother eight songs, taking up less than<br />\nthree minutes of time on an album that<br />\nruns for over forty minutes. Since it is<br />\nsituated before Song for Martin andChe<br />\non side two, those two songs easily<br />\nmanage to reinstate the quiet mood of<br />\nthe album.

After several years of<br />\nmarring potentially outstanding albums<br />\nsuch as Who Knows Where the Time Goes<br />\nand Living by vacillating between rough<br />\nsemi-blues-folk on one cut and amiable,<br />\nquiet folk on the next, she has finally<br />\nmade an album, the just released (Elektra<br />\n75053). in which she takes hold of one<br />\nsong style, the amiable, quiet folk style,<br />\nand keeps a firm grip on that style<br />\nthroughout almost the entire record.<br />\nGentleness<br />\nTrue Stories and Other Dreams is a<br />\ngentle album. Each melody is simply<br />\nwritten and simply performed, enriched<br />\nonly by careful but not complicated<br />\narranging and the strong sweet voice of<br />\nMiss Collins. And yet, the simple qualities<br />\nthat are present in each song are<br />\nintricately dovetailed to create a<br />\npowerful, emotional work. Whether the<br />\nsong is about the loss of childhood, as in<br />\nSecret Gardens the gradual disintegration<br />\nof a close friendship, such as in Song for<br />\nMartin or even the death of a<br />\nrevolutionary figure, as in Che the<br />\nsentiment and feeling emerge from within<br />\nthe carefully constructed matrix of<br />\nsimplicity and are felt with the full force<br />\nintended. Perhaps the most effective<br />\naspect of these constructions, apart from<br />\nthe singing of Miss Collins, is the<br />\ninstrumental accompaniment. The<br />\nsadness of lost childhood in Secret<br />\n<br />\ne/de 9Zsl4dt.5fa/8i<br />\n<br />\ncarefully built through the other songs,<br />\nthe album is strong enough not to let this<br />\ndeviation detract much from this mood.<br />\nThe person<br />\nBut what really makes the album an<br />\n-overwhelming success is Collins herself.<br />\nShe is probably the most prominent<br />\nfemale folk vocalist in the United States<br />\ntoday, and her popularity is<br />\nwell-deserved. She is at her best on True<br />\nStories and Other Dreams , seizing each<br />\nsong and then letting it go with all the<br />\npower necessary to drive it across to the<br />\nlistener. With that clear and forceful voice<br />\nof hers she is able to project the emotion<br />\nbehind the song. In Cook With Honey ,<br />\nprobably the best song on the record, she<br />\nis able to make the listener feel the<br />\nhappiness and joy that the song intends.<br />\nShe makes the lyrics, innocent yet droll<br />\ndouble entendres (\"I always cook with<br />\nhoney, To sweeten up the night, We<br />\nalways cook with honey, Tell me how's<br />\nyour appetite, For some sweet love\")<br />\nseem to bounce . Likewise, the listener<br />\ncan also feel the revolutionary fervor<br />\nintended in Che as Miss Collins tells the<br />\nstory of the death of Che Guevara and<br />\nwhat he represented in life. She sings it in<br />\na strong clear voice, and, despite the<br />\nmessage intended in the lyrics, the song is<br />\nan uplifting experience that is<br />\ntremendously inspiring. Above all, it is<br />\nJudy Collins who makes True Stories and<br />\nOther Dreams the gentle music that it iF<br />\nShe has learned her lesson well.<br />\n<br />\nesisimval ade.\"4 40<br />\n<br />\neTweal4.41;da'1:2%<br />\n<br />\n..444noesisi\u2022 crA<br />\n<br />\nsa,*444<br />\n<br />\nloaeisootsAmosoval<br />\ngiaAsda<br />\n\"<br />\nd tAZIC\u2022aeme,<br />\n<br />\n9AI<br />\n<br />\nabout my zip code.

But the Blue their ninth win in 16 outings.<br />\nJays were out to redeem (5-2 in the MAC).<br />\nthemselves after a Tuesday<br />\nFor Hopkins, Bobby<br />\nevening loss to arch rival Towson Freedman led all scorers with 19<br />\nState by a score of 84-77.

He scored<br />\neight minutes into the half. From only four points (about average<br />\nthen on, Hopkins built its lead, for him), but handed out assists<br />\ntaking only the good shots and like crazy and did a yeoman's job<br />\nplaying tenacious defense. At the on the Lebanon Valley guards.<br />\nhalf, the Blue Jays led by a score<br />\nAnother key to the hard<br />\nof 39-31.<br />\nearned and well deserved victory<br />\nHopkins and Lebanon Valley was the rebounding of the<br />\ntraded baskets to start the second shorter Blue Jays.

That seemed to The spirited play of the Blue Jay<br />\nrattle the /usually confident front four also denied Lebanon<br />\nFlying Dutchmen who started to Valley easy baskets.

He<br />\ntermed the victory a \"super\"<br />\nwin. Nationally, this Blue Jay<br />\nvictory has to be the upset of the<br />\nyear in small college basketball.<br />\nThe most impressive aspect of<br />\nthe 68-62 win was that Hopkins<br />\nwas able to bounCe back just two<br />\ndays after losing to Towson. In<br />\nthat game, Hopkins played the<br />\nTigers evenly in the first half,<br />\nleaving the .floor with a 43-41<br />\nlead. But the second half was a<br />\ndifferent story as Towson (with<br />\nthe aid of a few questionable<br />\ncalls by the referees who.<br />\nofficiated the second half with<br />\nseeing eye dogs) outrebounded<br />\nand outshot the Blue Jays.<br />\nHappy Birthday<br />\nBill Jews, celebrating his<br />\nbirthday, scored 26 points and<br />\nbagged 15 rebounds.

The Knicks dropped the<br />\nBullets early and Clark still was<br />\nunsigned. The Bullets stayed with<br />\nBoston until the final minutes in<br />\nthe fourth quarter when John<br />\nHavlicek put the game away and<br />\nstill Clark was waiting.<br />\nRookie Kevin Porter and<br />\nyear man Phil Chenier<br />\nsecond<br />\nfive between them.<br />\nthe job--Porter down<br />\ndoing<br />\nwere<br />\nOles<br />\nDick<br />\nBy this time, Coach<br />\nrunning offense and<br />\nthe<br />\nstretch<br />\na<br />\nof<br />\nvisions<br />\nhad<br />\nhave<br />\nmust<br />\nstunning upset, but the sabremen Chenier carrying the scoring<br />\nquickly put him at ease.

Debusschere pumped in<br />\na 25-foot howitzer at the buzzer<br />\nwinning his first two bouts.<br />\nand the Knicks were saved from<br />\nDissatisfied<br />\nOles<br />\nBaum and Green then won embarrassment. Embarrassment?<br />\nEven with Flynn Robinson<br />\ntheir second matches to pad the<br />\nfinal margin to a more and Phil Chernier sitting home<br />\nrespectable 16-11 tally.

That's<br />\nLivingston and Green for their been the enigma of this year's<br />\nvictories and Pantel and Roberts team.

After dropping the<br />\nheartbreaker to the Knicks, the<br />\nBullets downed Milwaukee in a<br />\nbarnburner on the road.<br />\nMilwaukee just wasn't up to par<br />\nmost of the press corps agreed<br />\nand that was that.<br />\nWhat most people failed to<br />\nrealize is that in the previous<br />\nthirteen encounters with the<br />\nBucks dating back to the potent<br />\ntwilight era of Gus Johnson, the<br />\nBullets had won only once. The<br />\ntime they did win came only<br />\nwhen Unseld and Johnson<br />\ncleared the boards igniting the<br />\nBullet fast break to lightning<br />\nproportions. When the dust<br />\nfinally settled in the first half,<br />\nthe Bullets led by 30 and coasted<br />\non in. The Bullets couldn't win<br />\nthe close ones from Milwaukee,<br />\nthat is, until this year.<br />\nWith Chenier and Robinson<br />\nstill sidelined and Stallworth<br />\nforced to perform sporadically at<br />\nguard, the Bullets upset<br />\nMilwaukee. Still nobody payed<br />\nattention to the Bullets. This win<br />\nwas a fluke and Archie's shadow<br />\nhad the fans wondering what<br />\nwould have happened if Clark<br />\nhad played from the beginning.<br />\nNo one can say and no one will<br />\nbe able to say how much the<br />\nlayoff hurts, but 31 year old<br />\nguards aren't helped by layoffs.<br />\nSo Archie Clark, one of last<br />\nyear's N.B.A. scoring leaders,<br />\nsigned while the Bullets were on<br />\na three game winning streak.<br />\n<br />\nWithout Clark the Bullets<br />\nmanaged well, giving Porter<br />\nvaluable experience that he<br />\ncouldn't have had if the Bullets<br />\nace backcourter had signed<br />\noriginally. And, since Mann has<br />\nbeen gone via the Hayes trade,<br />\nMike Riordan has come into his<br />\nown at forward. With IClark now,<br />\nthe Bullets have added firepower<br />\nthat brings home championships.<br />\nEven with Clark rusty the<br />\nBullets managed to extend their<br />\nwin streak to seven going into<br />\ntonight's scheduled Civil War at<br />\nthe Civic Center against the New<br />\nYork Knicks, Baltimore has<br />\ntaken ten of their last eleven.<br />\nJuggernaut<br />\nLast Sunday, Clark put the<br />\nclamp on Lenny Wilkens and that<br />\nwas the end of the Cavaliers but<br />\nperhaps last Tuesday's 104-86<br />\nvictory over Golden State is a<br />\nbetter indicator of Bullet<br />\nefficiency. Wes Unseld snatched<br />\n20 rebounds and held super giant<br />\nNate Thurmond to eleven points,<br />\nElvin Hayes canned 21 points,<br />\nRiordon scored 24 and held high<br />\nscoring Rick Barry to a dismal 13<br />\npoints, and Archie Clark pumped<br />\nin 24 tallies and handed out<br />\neleven assists.<br />\nStill the talk is whether it will<br />\nbe the Knicks or the Celtics in<br />\nthe N.B.A. championship series<br />\nwith each Baltimore win being<br />\nlabeled upset. If things keep up<br />\nthe way they're going, the Knicks<br />\nand the Celtics will be upset also;<br />\nby a juggernaut that no none ever<br />\nsaw come out of Baltimore.<br />\n<br />\n\ffebruary 2,1973/news-letter/page 11<br />\n<br />\nAthletic center enjoys wide use by women<br />\nBy DAN MYERS<br />\nThe second semester offers<br />\nHopkin's females the<br />\nopportunity to participate in a<br />\ngreat variety of sports, and it<br />\nappears that they are taking good<br />\nadvantage of this.

As<br />\n150-pounder Greg Goldman<br />\ncommented,\"We should've won.\"<br />\nSuccessful grapplers for<br />\nHopkins were 134-pounder Clark<br />\nKingery, who romped to a 13-7<br />\nwin=highlighted by 3 takedowns;<br />\n142-pounder Rob Fink, a 13-4<br />\nvictor with 3 near pins; Craig<br />\nStevens with 5 minutes of riding<br />\ntime and a 6-0 whitewash in the<br />\n167 pound class;undefeated 190<br />\n<br />\npound junior Neil Hazard, who<br />\ndestroyed highly-touted Clarion<br />\nState transfer Steve Sank, 14-5;<br />\nand freshman heavyweight Gary<br />\nMurza, who rolled to a 16-3 win.<br />\nThe losses were more difficult<br />\nto swallow and much more<br />\nclosely contested-especially in<br />\nthe 158 pound class. In that<br />\ndivision, freshman Dave Myrlock<br />\nhad a commanding 6-2 lead and<br />\nwas in complete control against<br />\nLebanon Valley co-captain Doren<br />\nLeathers, only to slip up for an<br />\n<br />\ninstant and allow himself to be<br />\npinned. Almost as frustrating<br />\nwere Mike Priviterra's 7-6 riding<br />\ntime defeat in the 126 pound<br />\nclass, and Greg Goldman's<br />\nnarrow 9-7 loss to 10 pounder<br />\nGuy Lesser, whom Greg<br />\ndescribed as \"a professional<br />\nstaller\" . Other vanquished Blue<br />\nJays were Ron Pucillo, a 7-3 loser<br />\nin the 118 pound category, and<br />\n177 pound Wayne Panullo, who<br />\ndropped an 8-2 decision to Alan<br />\nShortell-the only wrestler to<br />\n<br />\ndefeat Neil Hazard last year.<br />\nAshamed<br />\nAll in all, Hopkins won five<br />\nof the ten matches, but was<br />\nedged on points. However, the<br />\nmargin was considerably closer<br />\nthan last year's 24-18 loss at<br />\nLebanon Valley, and the Jay<br />\ngrapplers have nothing to be<br />\nashamed of.

In a<br />\nDecember 19, 1971 story in the<br />\nBaltimore Sun Ray stated that he would<br />\nnot accept the new job if it were<br />\noffered.\" He has stated however, that he<br />\nwould be willing to serve as a scientific<br />\nadvisor.<br />\nIn the letter to Russell Train, Lewis<br />\nRegenstein, National Coordinator of the<br />\nFund for Animals charged that Ray may<br />\nhave been responsible for the creation of<br />\nthe Commission and therefore, that his<br />\ninvolvement in the Commission would be<br />\n<br />\na case of \"political pork barreling.\"<br />\nWhen asked about the Commission,<br />\nRay said, \"I won't tell you where it came<br />\nfrom but it didn't come from me. But I<br />\nthink it's a damn good idea.\"<br />\nRay stated that he originally became<br />\ninvolved with the Mammal Protection Bill<br />\nas a result of a request by Representative<br />\nJohn D. Dingell (D.

I wish they didn't, but as long as<br />\nthey do, they might as well kill<br />\nproperly,\" Ray asserted.<br />\nThe controversy surrounding Ray and<br />\nhis possible selection to the Scientific<br />\nAdvisory Committee of the Marine<br />\nMammal Commission stems from his<br />\nalledged lobbying against a stron revised<br />\nversion of the Marine Mammal Bill which<br />\ncontained a provision for a moratorium<br />\non the killing of marine mammals such as<br />\nwhales.<br />\nThe original ocean mammal bills<br />\nsponsored by Senator Fred R. Harris(D.,<br />\nOkla.) and Representative David Pryor<br />\n(D., Ark.) called for a permanent halt to<br />\nall killing of ocean mammals. Opposition<br />\nfrom hunting and fishing groups, the<br />\nNRA and some industry and conservation<br />\ngroups caused the bill to be labeled as an<br />\n\"oversimplification\" and forced it to be<br />\nrewritten.<br />\nA weaker substitue bill, introduced by<br />\nGlen M. Anderson (d., Calif.) was<br />\nsupported by wildlife subcommittee<br />\nchairman Dingell and was labeled by Ray<br />\nas a \"good first step.\"<br />\nLewis Regenstein of the Fund for<br />\nAnimals in a May 31, 1972 Washington<br />\nPost article charged that a similar bill'<br />\ndrafted by Senator Ernest Hollings (D.,<br />\nS.C.) of the senate subcommittee on<br />\nOceans and Atmosphere contained a<br />\nflagrant exemption to the ban on imports<br />\nof Marine Mammal products given to the<br />\nfur industry. He also stated that the bill<br />\nas written allows \"unlimited imports of<br />\nseal skins and finished products for sale<br />\nin the U'S', even during the moratorium<br />\nperiod during which time all other<br />\nproducts are effectively banned.\"<br />\nFinal appointments to the newly<br />\ncreated Marine Mammal Commission will<br />\nbe made by President Nixon. Five names<br />\n<br />\nhave been sent to the President and of-those, three will be selected.<br />\nThe Fund for Animals, while opposing<br />\nthe appointments of Ray, Norris and<br />\nSchevill of the Smithsonian Marine<br />\nMammal Council, did reccommend Mr.<br />\nScott McVay, of Princeton University,<br />\nDr. Roger S.

Animal Fund<br />\nofficial's claim that Chapman, who has<br />\nlong been identified with the<br />\nInternational Whaling Commission, would<br />\nnot be a suitable canidate for the<br />\nCommission. In testimony offered before<br />\nthe House Foreign Affairs Committee in<br />\nJune 1971, Chapman unsuccessfully<br />\nopposed the resolutions calling for a<br />\nmoratorium on whaling. Regenstein's<br />\nletter notes that Chapman emphasized his<br />\nopposition to Interior Secretary Hickel's<br />\nearlier action in placing eight species of<br />\ngreat whales on his Department's<br />\nendangered species list.<br />\nDespite what appears to be bitter<br />\nantagonism between the Smithsonian<br />\nMarine Ma\u201eal Council members and<br />\nmembers of The Fund for Anima s, Dr.<br />\nRay does not see their positions as<br />\ncompletely antithetical.

The<br />\nPresident briefly touched on the<br />\nfinancial condition of the<br />\nUniversity, the size of the<br />\ngraduate and iundergraduate<br />\nstudent bodies, the scope of the<br />\nhousing problem and<br />\nadministrative priorities.<br />\nRegarding the budgetary<br />\ndifficulties of the last few years,<br />\nMuller said, \"we are doing<br />\nbetter.\" Adding that it had not<br />\nbeen easy to come from a $5<br />\nmillion deficit three iears ago,<br />\nMuller expressed optimism over<br />\nthe budget for 1973-74. \"I think<br />\nWe'll have a balanced budget and<br />\nthat we can keep a balanced<br />\nbudget for the future with some<br />\nluck and good management.\"<br />\nMuller asserted that even<br />\nthough the University had been<br />\nforced to curtail some amenities,<br />\nit is still academically sound and<br />\nthat it can be kept sound while a<br />\nbalanced budget is maintained.<br />\nMuller said that the University,<br />\nto maintain this balance, needed<br />\nnot only the support from public<br /><br />\nfunds, but also those from the<br />\nalumni.<br />\nAddressing himself to more<br />\ngeneral matters, the President<br />\nstated quite frankly that<br />\n\"Hopkins should not pretend to<br />\n,be a purely undergraduate<br />\ninstitution.\" Muller contended<br />\nthat the University \"does a good<br />\njob\", but that people must<br />\nremember that the school is for a<br />\nsmall clientele and that Hopkins<br />\nis not a big undergraduate<br />\ncampus.<br />\n\u2022<br />\nSpeaking about<br />\nundergraduates in general, Muller<br />\ncommented that an \"increase in<br />\nthe size of the student body<br />\nwould not be wise, primarily<br />\nbecause we just don't have the<br />\nfacilities.\" The President<br />\npredicted that in three to four<br />\nyears the student body would<br />\nreach a roughly stable level. \"I<br />\nthink that at that time we will<br />\nsee close to 700 coeds in an<br />\nundergraduate body of just over<br />\n2,000,\" he stated.<br />\nMuller additionally cautioned<br />\nthat it is \"an illusion\" to think<br />\nthat tuition costs could be<br />\nreduced by merely increasing the<br />\nsize of the student body. He<br />\nbased this remark on the fact<br />\nthat even at present, the tuition<br />\nnow paid by undergraduates only<br />\ncovers half the cost of their<br />\neducation.<br />\nCommenting on the faculty of<br />\nthe University, Muller remarked,<br />\n\"We have a good faculty now and<br /><br />\nNew transfer students<br />\nfollow normal trend<br />\nj<br />\ni<br /><br />\nBy RICHARD BLAND<br />\nOnly six new students have<br />\ntransferred to Hopkins this<br />\nsemester.<br />\nAccording to Glen A. Thomas,<br />\nan admissions officer, the<br />\nnumber is \"about normal\" for<br />\nSpring transfer admissions. \"Not<br />\ntoo many students were<br />\ninterested since often their<br />\nprograms wouldn't fit in with<br />\nsecond semester offerings,\" he<br />\nexplained.<br />\n'.These<br />\nThomas added that between<br />\n30 and 40<br />\nstudents had asked to<br />\nbe considered for transfer<br />\nadmission in the spring semester.<br />\nMost of these, he said, were<br />\ne ncouraged to delay a final<br />\napplication until the fall semster.<br />\nThomas also reported that 86<br />\ntransfer students had been<br />\naccepted in the fall of 1972. He<br />\n\u2022 noted that<br />\nabout ten of these<br />\nintended to major in the sciences,<br />\nWith most of the rest in the<br />\nh umanities.<br />\nThe admissions office also<br />\ni ndicated<br />\nthat there was less<br />\ne mphasis now upon the<br />\nadmission of women transfer<br />\nstudents than there had been<br />\nWhen women first came to<br />\nHopkins in 1970.<br />\nDistribution Goes<br />\nOf the six new transfer<br />\nstudents,<br />\nfour are women. The<br />\nclass distribution goes as follows:<br /><br />\none freshman, two sophomores<br />\nand three juniors. The six are<br />\nenrolled in either social sciences<br />\nor humanities.<br />\nThomas attributed a yearly<br />\nrise of transfer enrollment to \"a<br />\nsubstantial increase among<br />\nstudents wanting to transfer.\"<br />\nHe also commented that each<br />\napplicant for transfer was<br />\nscreened \"on an individual<br />\nbasis,\" making interviews an<br />\nintegral part of the application<br />\nprocedure.<br /><br />\nour efforts will be to make it as<br />\nperfect as we can.\" He warned<br />\nthat people should not judge the<br />\nquality of the various<br />\ndepartments purely on their size.<br />\n\"Our departments are going to<br />\nstay small,\" he asserted,\"and we<br />\ncan have good departments (with<br />\nless than 20 people) as long as we<br />\nmaintain a tradition in seeing<br />\nthat every member is as superb<br />\nprofessionally as we can find.\"<br />\nRegarding the current housing<br />\nsituation, Muller stressed that the<br />\nproblem \"is serious.\" He said this<br />\nwas in part due to the fact that<br />\nthe University feels it has an<br />\nobligation to all coeds to offer<br />\nthem university housing and as a<br />\nresult, many undergraduate men<br /><br />\nhave been forced to find housing<br />\non their own. While granting that<br />\nit would be difficult to solve the<br />\nproblem in the immediate future,<br />\nMuller did say that the situation<br />\nwould be examined over the<br />\nsummer. \"We are going to try to<br />\nspend a good part of the summer<br />\nworking on a long range solution<br />\nto the housing problem and to<br />\ntake a hard look at the<br />\nneighborhood around<br />\nHomewood,\" he remarked.<br />\nMuller concluded by saying<br />\nthat despite the problems faced<br />\nby Hopkins, \"I have no doubts<br />\nabout the future.\" After a year in<br />\nthe Presidency,\" he commented,<br />\n\"I am fonder of the school now<br />\nthan when I came.\"<br /><br />\nGroup seeks infirmary upgrade<br />\nBy ANDREW LASHLEY<br />\nGeneral dissatisfaction with the Student Health<br />\nService on the part of students and administration<br />\nhas led to a pledge of improvement and hints of<br />\ncomplete overhaul from Dean of Students Robert<br />\nFitzpatrick.<br /><br />\n\"I'm absolutely committed to getting changes<br />\nand improvements in the Brown Infirmary<br />\nservice,\" said Fitzpatrick. \"A study group<br />\ncomposed of undergraduates and graduate<br />\nstudents has been formed under the Homewood<br />\nAdvisory Council. I want it to isolate problems<br />\nwith the service, and give specific reccomendations<br />\non necessary improvements,\" he stated.<br />\nFrank Kollman, head of the study group formed<br />\non January 31, stated his own problems with the<br />\nHealth Service as the precipatating factor in his<br />\ncommittee activity.<br />\n\"A lot of people complain about incorrect<br />\ndiagnosis over there. In my case, an intestinal<br />\ninfection was diagnosed as a twenty-four hour bug.<br />\nThree weeks later I phoned my family doctor in<br />\nNew Jersey, and, on his advice, received treatment<br />\nat Union Memorial Hospital,\" noted Kollman.<br />\nKollman indicated that the purpose of his<br />\ncommittee should be two-fold: 1) to find out and<br />\nreport problems, and 2) to investigate, verify, or<br />\ndisprove rumors of bad treatment at the infirmary.<br />\n\"My main concern is to set up a group to find<br />\nout the problems with the Brown Infirmary and to<br />\ninvestigate atrocity rumors,\" Kollman said.<br />\nA variety of complaints voiced by Hopkins<br />\ncommunity members include the inadequacy of<br />\nfacilities and testing services, and the<br />\nincorrvenience of the Infirmary for studnets living<br />\noff campus. At the present, the Health Service<br />\ncannot treat undergraduate or graduate student's<br />\nfamilies due to budget limitations.<br />\n\"Part of the problem that the clinic has faced is<br />\nthat it floated as an orphan between East<br />\nBaltimore and Homewood for years. Funding has<br />\nalways been a problem, and is now provided for by<br />\nHomewood,\" Fitzpatrick said.<br />\nFitzpatrick explained that<br />\nthere are a number of<br />\npossibilities for improved health<br />\ncare for the Homewood<br />\nHutzler Reading Room, Sydnor mentioned were the community. \"The direction I<br />\ncoffee house to be sponsored by would like to go is toward a<br />\nMARYPIRG, a video tape<br />\nthe freshman and sophomore system like Yale's , which has a<br />\nmachine, a pinball machine, and<br />\nclasses and the junior class $180 per year mandatory health<br />\nthe Hullaballoo.<br />\nconcert series in April.<br />\n\"I don't expect many more<br />\nprogram charge, which covers<br />\nAt the end of the term, any insurance and all medical<br />\npeople to vote, so the top three<br />\nclass money that is unbudgeted services. \u2022 There is a possibility,<br />\nwill probably stand,\"Sheppard<br />\nor unexpended will be divided<br />\nsaid.<br />\nhowever, of using Union<br />\nevenly; half to be held in escrow<br />\nAfter the budget is finally<br />\nMemorial Hospital facilities when<br />\nfor the next class president's their new building is completed,\"<br />\nformulated, it will go before the<br />\nbudget and half is reverted to the<br />\nSAC Executive Committee for<br />\nFitzpatrick stated.<br />\nSAC contingency fund as of June<br />\napproval.<br />\nDemand.<br />\n30th of that fiscal year.<br />\nHopkins Union Director Jim<br />\nThe only recent additional<br />\nClass monies that are unspent<br />\nSydnor forsees no trouble in the<br />\nservice offerred at the Brown<br />\napproval of the senior class or unencumbered by May 1st of Infirmary is the Ob-Gyn clinic<br />\n,the senior class graduating year ,which operates free of charge for<br />\nbudget.<br />\nwill be allocated by a special<br />\nHopkins students Tuesday<br />\nSome Good Class<br />\n\"We've gotten some good class committee consisting of the<br />\nevenings, and with a minimal<br />\nprojects and I think that the senior class president, the senior<br />\ncharge Thursday evenings for<br />\nclass treasurer, the president of<br />\nreferendum is a strong enough<br />\nHopkins dependents.

He stated that a leader<br />\n\"can advise, propose, adjust,<br />\nexplain, condemn and exhort - he<br />\ncannot control.\"<br />\nMuller spent three years<br />\nWriting his thesis, which appeared<br />\nin February, 1958, and no doubt<br />\nSpent a long time developing<br />\nsome of the ideas in it. Fifteen<br />\nYears later, as he begins his<br />\nsecond year as President of<br />\nHopkins, some of them are still<br />\nevident in what he does and what<br />\nhe says.<br />\nHe is still willing to take risks,<br />\nto do what has not been done<br />\nbefore and to lead, not by force,<br />\nbut by careful planning and<br />\naction.<br />\nWhen he arrived here as<br />\nProvost in April 1971, Hopkins<br />\nwas in serious trouble. There was<br />\nno permanent president, no<br />\nWorthwhile fundraising, and no<br />\n\u00b0Ile office committed to the<br />\nn on-academic life of students. No<br />\n\u00b0Ile administrator was<br />\nresponsible for the nuts and bolts<br />\naoministration of the Homewood<br />\ncampus and oddly, no<br />\nundergraduate had ever been a<br />\nRhodes scholar, as he had been.<br />\nWithin seven months of his<br />\nassuming the presidency, Muller<br />\nChanged all that. Most<br />\nI mportantly, last October, her<br />\nProposed to the Board of<br />\nT rustees, meeting in<br />\nWilliamsburg, Va., that Hopkins<br />\nu ndertake a $200 million<br />\ncentennial capital campaign,<br />\nI ncluding 100 endowed<br />\nProfessorships worth $1 million<br />\neach. He told the Board,\" For<br />\nthe University to ask for one<br />\n.hundred endowed positions for<br />\nIts faculty will be a dramatic<br /><br />\nchallenge, and one that will once<br />\nmore turn the eyes of not only<br />\nour own community , but of the<br />\nwhole nation, on us.\"<br />\nHe added,\" We; propose doing<br />\nsomething on a scale no other<br />\nuniversity in this country, or for<br />\nthat matter in the world, has<br />\nattempted to do before.\" The<br />\ncampaign, which is expected to<br />\ntake several years to complete,<br />\nwill be announced formally at<br />\nCommemoration Day February<br />\n22nd.<br />\nAlthough fundraising is one of<br />\nthe chief concerns of any<br />\nuniversity president, Muller has<br />\nnot spent all his time on it during<br />\nhis first year. He has spent<br />\nconsiderable time dealing with<br />\nadministrative problems both in<br />\nthe University and in the<br />\nHospital, of which he became<br />\nPresident on October 1st.<br />\nMost important to students at<br />\nHomewood, Muller fulfilled one<br />\nof the key recommendations of<br />\nlast year's Blue Ribbon Panel on<br />\nUndergraduate Education by<br />\nreviving the position of Dean of<br />\nStudents, which had been<br />\nallowed to lapse following the<br />\ndeath of W. Kelso Morrill in<br />\n1968.<br />\nBut instead of giving the job to<br />\na professor who couldn't quite<br />\nmake it academically, or to a<br />\ncollegiate version of a high school<br />\nguidance counselor, he gave it to<br />\nRobert Fitzpatrick, a Baltimore<br />\nCity Councilman and aide to<br />\nformer Senator Joseph Tydings.<br />\nHe did it in culmination of a<br />\nsurprising episode.<br />\nWhen trouble erupted out of a<br />\nparty at the Phi Gamma Delta<br />\nfraternity house last May, the<br />\nstory was in the Sun and Muller<br />\ncalled Fitzpatrick, who<br />\nrepresents the area around the<br />\nGam house, and asked him what<br />\nhe intended to do about it.<br /><br />\nSteven Muller and his wife, Margie greet a guest at his installation<br />\nreception last year. Trustee chairman Robert D.H. Harvey and his<br />\nWife are in the background.<br /><br />\nFitzpatrick thought a moment<br />\nand replied, \"It's your problem.<br />\nYou take care of it.\" Soon after,<br />\nFitzpatrick found out that he<br />\nwas to be offered the deanship.<br />\nFew university presidents would<br />\nallow themselves to be in a<br />\nposition where they could be<br />\neasily upstaged by an ambitious<br />\nyoung politician. And in fact,<br />\nFitzpatrick is in the Sunpapers<br />\nand on television more often<br />\nthan Muller is.<br />\nFitzpatrick, with his city post,<br />\nis very free to challenge Muller<br />\nand other University<br />\nadministrators on their decisions<br />\nand policies. He has already done<br />\njust that about the quality of<br />\ncampus food service, especially in<br />\nthe dorm cafeteria.<br />\nMuller moved very shrewdly in<br />\nsome other administrative<br />\nappointments he made soon after<br />\ntaking office. In creating the post<br />\nof Vice President for the<br />\nHomewood Divisions and in<br />\nasking former Dean George<br />\nBenton to fill! it, he<br />\naccomplished two important<br />\nends: first, he centralized what<br />\nhad been an absurd, helter skelter<br />\nadministrative structure-nearly all<br />\nthe administrative offices on the<br />\nHomewood campus which once<br />\nreported to one of three officers<br />\nnow report directly to Vice<br /><br />\nPresident Benton; second, he<br />\nforced Benton to work on the<br />\nvery administrative weknesses<br />\nthe former dean had so bitterly<br />\ncriticized during the Gordon<br />\nyears, effectively silencing a very<br />\npowerful and influential critic.<br />\nBenton even found himself with<br />\ntime to teach a course last<br />\nsemester and is often out of town<br />\na day or two a week.<br />\nEqually as clever and as<br />\nnecessary to start his<br />\nadministration effectively, Muller<br />\nreplaced Benton as Dean with Dr.<br />\nGeorge Owen, then chairman of<br />\nthe physics department and a<br />\nleader of the faculty group<br />\nwhich toppled Lincoln Gordon<br />\nfrom the presidency on March<br />\n12, 1971. For Owen, things look<br />\nvery different now from the<br />\nDean's office than they did two<br />\nyears ago from his spot in the<br />\nPhysics department. It is unlikely<br />\nthat Owen would challenge<br />\nMuller as he once challenged<br />\nGordon. Also, the deanship<br />\nOwens now holds is far, less<br />\ninfluential than the one Benton<br />\nheld; many of the dean's<br />\nadministrative responsibilities<br />\nwere shifted away, thus reducing<br />\nthe influence of the job.<br />\nFar less dramatic, but no less<br />\nimportant to the image of<br />\nHopkins, Muller helped obtain a<br /><br />\nRhodes scholarship for Senior<br />\nClass President Bud Sheppard,<br />\nwho was certainly well qualified<br />\nfor the honor, both in terms<br />\nof his academic work and his<br />\noutside activities.<br />\nThere is no doubt that Muller<br />\nhas accomplished a lot in his first<br />\nyear, but some students suspect<br />\nhe is only using Hopkins as a<br />\nstepping stone and needs to make<br />\na good record. About that, no<br />\none can be sure, but whatever his<br />\nplans are, nothing can take away<br />\nfrom the sheer quality of his<br />\nadministrative skill.<br />\nDean Owen commented,\"In<br />\nhis first year, he has provided a<br />\nbrilliant display of leadership.<br />\nHe's provided a very positive<br />\nfeeling about this place.\"<br />\nMuller himself would likely be<br />\nmore cautious, for,. he was the<br />\none who wrote that the evolution<br />\nof leadership is seldom<br />\ndramatically clear.\" He would<br />\nprobably say that only -time will<br />\ntell the quality of leadership he<br />\nhas provided.<br />\nEnd of Part I<br />\nThe second part of the series<br />\non Steven Muller and his first<br />\nyear as president of Hopkins will<br />\nappear on Tuesday.<br /><br />\nTHE HOPKINS<br /><br />\nbetter health<br /><br />\n.

In this interview<br />\nRobert Ruby questions John Gibson,<br />\nchairman of the Council on<br />\nInterfraternity Affairs.)<br />\nNews-Letter: The most obvious<br />\nquestion to ask is probably the lamest,<br />\nbut it's still important. What is the<br />\npurpose of fraternities at a small<br />\nco-educational school?<br />\nJohn Gibson: Fraternities are even<br />\nmore essential at a small co-educational<br />\nschool than they are at the large schools.<br />\nIn my own case, I came. to Hopkins<br />\nknowing that I didn't want to become a<br />\nstereotyped fraternity man, and I had to<br />\nfind out for myself that the stereotypes<br />\nweren't true. I was in Adams House at the<br />\ndorms, and a lot of the people there were<br />\nstudying all the time, which was a big<br />\nchange from high school. There was a lot<br />\nof pressure, partially because the school is<br />\nso small<br /><br />\na lot of academic nressurP<br /><br />\nPeople were learning about chemistry,<br />\nimpressed<br /><br />\ntwirl<br /><br />\nthe group\u2014they<br /><br />\nwere<br /><br />\nnormal people. They had some parties<br />\nand other things, the things I had<br />\nanticipated from college in a general way.<br />\nAnd I know that the fraternity has<br />\nenriched my experience here: My<br />\nsophomore and junior years have been<br />\nenjoyable, but I hated it as a freshman; I<br />\nwas writing away for transfer information<br />\nand that type of things. There was too<br />\nmuch pressure.<br />\nIs this the reason why fraternities exist<br />\nat Hopkins?<br />\nNo, and I don't think the fraternities at<br />\nHopkins are typical. At Southern schools<br />\nthey're usually thought of as being<br />\nconservative bulwarks against the tide of<br />\nliberalism, but Hopkins fraternities are<br />\ndistinct. A lot of people in the dorms are<br />\nusually interested in med school and<br />\nstudying\u2014they already know their<br />\ninterests\u2014while in the fraternities, the<br />\npeople usually aren't so sure about what<br />\nthey want, they're more undecided;<br />\nthey're more interested in people. Too<br />\noften you meet people who are interested<br />\nin you as a brain and not as a<br />\nperson\u2014they're interested in you as an<br />\nachiever.<br />\nI think there's a lot more personal<br />\nresponsibility in a fraternity. In a dorm<br />\nyou don't have to talk to people. If you<br />\nget mad at someone, you can go down<br />\nthe hall to your room and just shut the<br />\ndoor. But in a fraternity house, you can't<br />\nignore someone if you don't get along<br />\nwith him. The thing that holds<br />\nfraternities together at Hopkins is<br />\nfriendships, not structure. ...They're a<br />\nplace for upperclassmen to go. You don't<br />\nthink of upperclassmen going to the<br />\nsnack bar in the dorms.<br />\nWhat about the relationship between<br />\nfraternities and the University? Is it a<br />\nvery hostile thing or is everyone satisfied?<br />\nThis is a pretty big question, and I<br />\ndon't have any real answers. As far as<br />\nrush, the school uses about the same<br />\ntheory that they do for freshmen: they're<br />\nnot trying to be substitute parents. You<br />\nguys do the work, and we (the school)<br />\nwill give you a few guidelines. They try to<br />\ncontrol us at fingertips, in that there is no<br />\nreally firm control.<br />\nWhat can the University threaten as a<br />\nsanction against a fraternity?<br />\nThe school can withdraw recognition<br />\nfrom a House, as it did temporarily with<br />\nPhi Gam. It's questionable what effect<br />\nthat has. No\u2014it can have a lot of effect:<br />\nIt could prevent us from rushing in the<br />\ndorms, and that would be very serious.<br />\nThe sanctions are either all or nothing, so<br />\nmost things get talked out at the personal<br />\nlevel.<br />\nIs this how it should be?<br />\nWell, when Eisenhower was here, there<br /><br />\nwas a proposal for the school to build<br />\nfraternity houses, but the fraternities<br />\nwould have been subject to the same rules<br />\nas the dormitories were at that time\u2014the<br />\nsame food plan, parietals, and so on. The<br />\nproposal was voted down at the time, and<br />\nI don't think most fraternities want any<br />\ncontrol now. We like it when the<br />\nUniversity helps us out, but they don't go<br />\nout of their way.<br />\nYou still haven't said whether this is<br />\nthe way the Council on Interfraternity<br />\nAffairs(C.I.A.) thinks it should be.<br />\nI think the consensus is that we really<br />\ndon't want to be controlled by the<br />\nUniversity. The school says do what you<br />\n(the fraternities) want, but we want to<br />\nhelp you. We organize rush at our own<br />\nexpense, but they can come in and try to<br />\ntell us how it should be done.<br />\nHas the school ever disciplined a<br />\nfraternity, outside of the incident with<br />\nPhi Gam this fall, and has the fraternity<br />\ncouncil ever disciplined one of its own<br />\nnipmhorc?<br />\nWell, again need to mention the idea<br />\nEt,a lila!? will come<br /><br />\n111<br /><br />\noccasionally<br /><br />\nto our meetings. They're not tough guys<br /><br />\nor hard asses about it. The way it is now,<br />\nFitzpatrick does a good job.<br />\nThe old Inter Fraternity Council was<br />\nalmost defunct last year, and the<br />\nUniversity wanted to meet with all the<br />\nnew fraternity presidents in the spring. So<br />\nwe had a meeting, and we(the C.I.A.)<br />\ntook it over from there. We wanted to<br />\nmake a good impression on the freshmen;<br />\nwe wanted to do something about the<br />\nstereotypes. We operate by unanimous<br />\ndecisions. A seven-to-one or eight-to-one<br />\nvote isn't any good\u2014everything is done<br />\non a unanimous basis.<br />\nAgain, has the fraternity council ever<br />\ndisciplined one of its members?<br />\nNo, there have been any incidents-.<br />\nLet's go back to what the C.I.A. thinks<br />\nits relationship with the University should<br />\nbe. What would be the ideal set up?<br /><br />\nIt would be better if there were some<br />\nintermediate steps, not just the all or<br />\nnothing sanctions. Hopkins could help us<br />\nout, for example, with beer kegs. The<br />\nprice of kegs is going up every semester,<br />\nand during rush that involves a lot of<br />\nmoney. There was a proposal for the<br />\nfraternities to be able to get the kegs<br />\nthrough the Grad Club, which has a beer<br />\nlicense, but there were problems and it<br />\nwas delayed and delayed. If the<br />\nUniversity could supply us with that<br />\nservice, it would be doing something for<br />\nus and could eliminate some of the<br />\nresentment that exists. I think all the<br />\nfraternities have this feeling.<br />\nYou're saying that this idea beer keg<br />\nservice would be an example of an<br />\nintermediate type of control by the<br />\nschool?<br />\nYes. If the school didn't like the way<br />\nwe were planning rush, for instance, they<br />\nwould be able to say, all right, no beer.\u2022<br />\nThey could withdraw their service.<br />\nft wpm IflUt 5 uecri puuticiztu a<br />\nvoar hag hp ra the&gt; rp \u2022<br />\nLritiliz<br /><br />\nfi<br /><br />\nt<br /><br />\nt he<br /><br />\nfnnr<br /><br />\nWI<br /><br />\ninn<br /><br />\nnorthern<br /><br />\nfraternities belong to the neighborhood<br />\nassociation, and all except one of the<br />\nfraternities south of the campus belong to<br />\nthe Charles Village Association. I'm not<br />\nsure about Sig Ep; they may not actually<br />\nbe in Charles Village. TEP and Phi Gam<br />\nhave had a cocktail party for the<br />\nneighbors, and it made a tremendous<br />\ndifference. Before, the neighbors<br />\nprobably saw us as something to be afraid<br />\nof-18 or 20 guys moving into the<br />\nneighborhood and things like that. We're<br />\ndoing as much as we can to get along with<br />\nthem.<br />\nOne real problem we have is with<br />\nnoise. During rush, I think all the houses<br />\nare going to have some problems with<br />\nthis. We're going to have monitors<br />\nououtside each house to try to keep<br />\npeople quiet when they leave. We're<br />\nmaking the effort<br /><br />\nBy B.H.

I was in the<br />\nGrand Ballroom of the<br />\nWashington Hilton not as a<br />\nreporter, but as an invited guest,<br />\nnominated by Steven Muller to<br />\nhelp represent the University at<br />\nthis momentous event.

The melodies are soft and<br />\npleasing, as are the lyrics.

Each melody is simply<br />\nwritten and simply performed, enriched<br />\nonly by careful but not complicated<br />\narranging and the strong sweet voice of<br />\nMiss Collins. And yet, the simple qualities<br />\nthat are present in each song are<br />\nintricately dovetailed to create a<br />\npowerful, emotional work. Whether the<br />\nsong is about the loss of childhood, as in<br />\nSecret Gardens the gradual disintegration<br />\nof a close friendship, such as in Song for<br />\nMartin or even the death of a<br />\nrevolutionary figure, as in Che the<br />\nsentiment and feeling emerge from within<br />\nthe carefully constructed matrix of<br />\nsimplicity and are felt with the full force<br />\nintended. Perhaps the most effective<br />\naspect of these constructions, apart from<br />\nthe singing of Miss Collins, is the<br />\ninstrumental accompaniment. The<br />\nsadness of lost childhood in Secret<br /><br />\ne/de 9Zsl4dt.5fa/8i<br /><br />\ncarefully built through the other songs,<br />\nthe album is strong enough not to let this<br />\ndeviation detract much from this mood.<br />\nThe person<br />\nBut what really makes the album an<br />\n-overwhelming success is Collins herself.<br />\nShe is probably the most prominent<br />\nfemale folk vocalist in the United States<br />\ntoday, and her popularity is<br />\nwell-deserved. She is at her best on True<br />\nStories and Other Dreams , seizing each<br />\nsong and then letting it go with all the<br />\npower necessary to drive it across to the<br />\nlistener. With that clear and forceful voice<br />\nof hers she is able to project the emotion<br />\nbehind the song. In Cook With Honey ,<br />\nprobably the best song on the record, she<br />\nis able to make the listener feel the<br />\nhappiness and joy that the song intends.<br />\nShe makes the lyrics, innocent yet droll<br />\ndouble entendres (\"I always cook with<br />\nhoney, To sweeten up the night, We<br />\nalways cook with honey, Tell me how's<br />\nyour appetite, For some sweet love\")<br />\nseem to bounce . Likewise, the listener<br />\ncan also feel the revolutionary fervor<br />\nintended in Che as Miss Collins tells the<br />\nstory of the death of Che Guevara and<br />\nwhat he represented in life. She sings it in<br />\na strong clear voice, and, despite the<br />\nmessage intended in the lyrics, the song is<br />\nan uplifting experience that is<br />\ntremendously inspiring. Above all, it is<br />\nJudy Collins who makes True Stories and<br />\nOther Dreams the gentle music that it iF<br />\nShe has learned her lesson well.<br /><br />\nesisimval ade.\"4 40<br /><br />\neTweal4.41;da'1:2%<br /><br />\n..444noesisi\u2022 crA<br /><br />\nsa,*444<br /><br />\nloaeisootsAmosoval<br />\ngiaAsda<br />\n\"<br />\nd tAZIC\u2022aeme,<br /><br />\n9AI<br /><br />\nabout my zip code.
