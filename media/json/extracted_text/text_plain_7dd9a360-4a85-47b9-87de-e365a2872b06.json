The<br />\nstudy will be continued this corning year.<br />\n\"The most important changes<br />\ninvolve an attempt to give the<br />\nstudents in their first years a<br />\nclearer picture of what a college<br />\neducation is designed to do, and<br />\nalso the introduction of methods<br />\nto give students a reading know-<br />\n<br />\nledge of French and German in as<br />\nshort a time as possible.

These changes were<br />\ndesigned to train more effectively<br />\nthose students who may be looking forward to entering the School<br />\nof Higher Studies as New Plan<br />\nstudents and also to broaden and<br />\nmodernize the opportunities of<br />\nthose students wishing a liberal<br />\neducation leading to the A.B. degree.
