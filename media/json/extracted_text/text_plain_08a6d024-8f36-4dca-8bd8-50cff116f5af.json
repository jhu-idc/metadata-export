Lewin<br />\nstated that only two of those<br />\nshowed for the interviews<br />\nWednesday.<br />\nThe committee will have<br />\nseveral factors to consider when<br />\nreviewing the qualifications of<br />\neach candidate.<br />\nLewin explained that some of<br />\nthis year's applicants had been<br />\ninvolved in a workshop<br />\nsponsored earlier in the year 1;;,^<br />\nthe Union, under the direction of<br />\nAlan Sapakie. According to<br />\nLewin, the six to seven week<br />\nsession with an \"Orientation<br />\nguy\" from Cornell has given<br />\nsome applicants time and<br />\nexposure to thinking about the<br />\nproblems of Orientation, thereby<br />\nproviding them a stronger base<br />\ngrom which to voice their ideas<br />\nfor the fall event.<br />\nIt's the type of thing where,by<br />\ntalking about Orientation for six<br />\nor seven weeks, they've gained<br />\nsome expertise in the area.\"<br />\nLewin commented.<br />\nThe senior blamed pool<br />\n<br />\npublicity of the workshop for the<br />\nlack of attendence exhibited by<br />\nmost of the Orientation<br />\napplicants.<br />\n\"Most of the people I asked<br />\nsaid that they just hadn't known<br />\nabout the workshops,\" Lewin<br />\ncontinued.<br />\n\"Ignorance is certainly a valid<br />\nexcuse in this case as I feel that<br />\nthe project didn't receive enough<br />\npublicity.\"<br />\nLewin also cited the<br />\n\"Head-on\" competition that had<br />\ndeveloped between membersof<br />\nthe original workshop who had<br />\nsince decided to apply for the<br />\nposition. Two of the seven<br />\nworkshop attendents are involved<br />\nin the selection.<br />\nLewin stressed that objectivity<br />\nwould be maintained on his part<br />\ndespite the circumstances that<br />\nhad evolved out of the workshop<br />\nseries. He also expressed hope<br />\nthat the other members of the<br />\nSelections Committee would<br />\nhold as objective a viewpoint as<br />\npossible under the circumstances.<br />\n\"The position should be open<br />\nto the student body and not just<br />\not those who attended the<br />\nworkshops,\" Lewin asserted.<br />\n\"EAch applicant will be<br />\n<br />\nlooked at as anyone else.\"<br />\nAnother issue that the SC<br />\nChairman and his Committee<br />\nmembers will have to contend<br />\nwith is the situation of having<br />\none of its members applying for<br />\nthee position on whichshe will<br />\nhave a deciding vote.<br />\n\"Shep Hoffman and I brought<br />\nup the issue that Sue Matson<br />\nconsider resigning from the<br />\nSElections Committee at last<br />\nTuesday's SC meeting,\"<br />\ncontinued Lewin.<br />\n\"I was concerned over the<br />\ncredibility of the Council if they<br />\nbacked any member who pursued<br />\na student position during their<br />\nSC term. At last Tuesday's<br />\nmeeting, everyone backed her<br />\n100%.\"<br />\nAs for last fall's Orientation,<br />\nLewin stated that the Union had<br />\nfelt \"too many hass1;,ss behind the<br />\nscenes\" and complained of an<br />\noverall lack of organization,<br />\nthough execution of the<br />\nweek-long activities went<br />\nrelatively well.<br />\nLewin stated that Sapakie had<br />\nexpressed concern over the<br />\ndistribution of authority and felt<br />\nthat \"not enough people had<br />\ngotten involved in Orientation.\"<br />\n<br />\nHe accused George S. Benton,<br />\nVice-President for Homewood<br />\nDivisions and chairman of the<br />\nEnergy Committee, of \"using the<br />\ncommittee as a rubber stamp for<br />\nhis own policies.\" He added,<br />\n\"Every one on the committee is<br />\nbeing abused.\"<br />\nShep Hoffmann, Senior Class<br />\nPresident, pointed out that any<br />\nUniversity closing was a de facto<br />\nincrease in tuition for the<br />\nHopkins student population.\"We<br />\nare not prepared to sanction a<br />\nshutdown to save the University<br />\nmoney,\" he declared and SAvitz<br />\npromptly seconded him.<br />\nLater these concerns gave way<br />\nto the fear, expressed by Bob<br />\nLewin, Selections Committee<br />\nchairman, that the selection of<br />\nSusan Matson, Junior Class<br />\nrepresentative, as Orientation<br />\nchairman for next fall would<br />\nexpose her and the Selections<br />\nCommittee of which she is a<br />\nmember to charges of conflicting<br />\ninterst, and favoritism.<br />\n<br />\nInformed<br />\nLewin was supported by<br />\nHoffmann in suggesting that<br />\nMatson might better resign from<br />\nher position on the Committee,<br />\n\"smelling not like a rose but with<br />\nno odor at all.\"<br />\nMatson evidently was<br />\nuncomfortable with her position<br />\nand appeared reluctant to leave<br />\nthe Selections Committee. Most<br />\nStudent Council members saw<br />\nlittle reason to dispute her. Ben<br />\nMansfield, Senior Class<br />\nrepresentative, noted that a<br />\nCouncil decision on this matter<br />\nwould set a precedent. In<br />\nparticular, she said, the<br />\nrepurcussions might be felt by<br />\nSavitz himself who has indicated<br />\ninterest in presenting a topic for<br />\nthe Eisenhower Symposium. The<br />\nsame point was not lost on<br />\nSAvitz who gave the chair to<br />\nJohn Colmers, Vice-President , to<br />\npreside over the rest of the<br />\ndiscussion.<br />\nThe question was in the end<br />\nleft to the Selections Committee<br />\nitself to decide.<br />\n<br />\n\fpage 4/news-letter/february 8, 1974<br />\n<br />\nDr. Paulson named to Mellon chair in the Humanities<br />\nDr. Ronald Paulson, chairman<br />\nof the English Department, has<br />\nbeen named to the newly<br />\nestablished Andrew W.

Rallying<br />\nfrom an early deficit, the Blue<br />\nJays relied on the hot hands of<br />\nGreg DeLong and Bobby<br />\nFreedman to keep them alive in<br />\nthe opening period, then used the<br />\nfirepower of Paul Spence and Bill<br />\nJews to come from behind once<br />\nmore for the victory. In addition,<br />\nthe excellent defensive work of<br />\nall four as well as Doug Campbell<br />\nrestrained a squad with a decided<br />\nphysical advantage.<br />\nz<br />\nts<br />\nIn the opening minutes of the z<br />\ncontest, Hopkins began with its<br />\ntypical sluggish and careless early<br />\nperformance. Fortunately for the<br />\nJays, Ursinus sought to capitalize<br />\non these lapses by being more<br />\naggressive, a strategy that netted<br />\ntheir center, George Kinek, four<br />\nfouls in the opening twelve<br />\nminutes. With the MAC's leading<br />\nrebounder on the bench, the<br />\nBears could do no better than<br />\nmatch Hopkins in turning the<br />\nball over. As Freedman's hand<br />\nwarmed, the Jays found<br />\nthemselves battling for the lead<br />\nonce again after having trailed by<br />\nas many as seven. Ursinus held a<br />\n35-31 halftime advantage, a<br />\n<br />\nremarkable feat for the Blue Jays<br />\nconsidering that Hopkins shot<br />\nonly 35% while the Bears hit<br />\n50%.<br />\nThe Jays made one alteration<br />\nin their lineup at the half,<br />\nstarting the 6-1 Spence in place<br />\nof the 6-6 Fender. With the<br />\nBears' Kinek still on the bench,<br />\nthis left the bulk of the<br />\n<br />\nIL<br />\n<br />\nBobby Freedman scores two against Ursinus<br />\n<br />\nLeague!<br />\n<br />\nLeague 11<br />\nDU<br />\n-ATO<br />\nComets<br />\nBatslax<br />\nMinor<br />\nIndependents<br />\nPiK A<br />\nConquistidores<br />\nHill<br />\nPhi Gam 69<br />\nHoly Rollers 49<br />\nBoston 46<br />\nRoots 59<br />\nBatslax 75<br />\nFenton 111<br />\nScotch 53<br />\nLevering Hall 43<br />\nOur Team 55<br />\nRoyce 46<br />\nGildersleeve 41<br />\nSylvester 1 (forfeit)<br />\nJennings 48<br />\nGriffin 53<br />\nDU 47<br />\nthe J.D.'s 54<br />\nCountry Pie 60<br />\nBSU 75<br />\nATO 72<br />\nBatslax 57<br />\nComets 57<br />\nTEP 71<br />\nFenton 87<br />\nScotch 71<br />\nRoyce 39<br />\nWilson-Wood 38<br />\nGildersleeve 35<br />\nJennings 58<br />\nHollander 56<br />\n<br />\n2-0<br />\n2-0<br />\n1-0<br />\n2-1<br />\n2-1<br />\n1-2<br />\n1-2<br />\n0-2<br />\n0-3<br />\n<br />\n3-0<br />\n2-0<br />\n2-0<br />\n3-1<br />\n1-2<br />\n1-2<br />\n1-2<br />\n0-3<br />\n0-3<br />\n<br />\nminutes of play as Ursinus came<br />\nalive with the return of their big<br />\nman.

Playing without<br />\nJews, who was sidelined with<br />\nshin splints, the Jays held their<br />\nown against an excellent<br />\ndefensive squad. Poor shooting,<br />\nhowever, proved to be their<br />\ndownfall as the Middies pulled<br />\naway in the late going.

Lewin<br />\nstated that only two of those<br />\nshowed for the interviews<br />\nWednesday.<br />\nThe committee will have<br />\nseveral factors to consider when<br />\nreviewing the qualifications of<br />\neach candidate.<br />\nLewin explained that some of<br />\nthis year's applicants had been<br />\ninvolved in a workshop<br />\nsponsored earlier in the year 1;;,^<br />\nthe Union, under the direction of<br />\nAlan Sapakie. According to<br />\nLewin, the six to seven week<br />\nsession with an \"Orientation<br />\nguy\" from Cornell has given<br />\nsome applicants time and<br />\nexposure to thinking about the<br />\nproblems of Orientation, thereby<br />\nproviding them a stronger base<br />\ngrom which to voice their ideas<br />\nfor the fall event.<br />\nIt's the type of thing where,by<br />\ntalking about Orientation for six<br />\nor seven weeks, they've gained<br />\nsome expertise in the area.\"<br />\nLewin commented.<br />\nThe senior blamed pool<br /><br />\npublicity of the workshop for the<br />\nlack of attendence exhibited by<br />\nmost of the Orientation<br />\napplicants.<br />\n\"Most of the people I asked<br />\nsaid that they just hadn't known<br />\nabout the workshops,\" Lewin<br />\ncontinued.<br />\n\"Ignorance is certainly a valid<br />\nexcuse in this case as I feel that<br />\nthe project didn't receive enough<br />\npublicity.\"<br />\nLewin also cited the<br />\n\"Head-on\" competition that had<br />\ndeveloped between membersof<br />\nthe original workshop who had<br />\nsince decided to apply for the<br />\nposition. Two of the seven<br />\nworkshop attendents are involved<br />\nin the selection.<br />\nLewin stressed that objectivity<br />\nwould be maintained on his part<br />\ndespite the circumstances that<br />\nhad evolved out of the workshop<br />\nseries. He also expressed hope<br />\nthat the other members of the<br />\nSelections Committee would<br />\nhold as objective a viewpoint as<br />\npossible under the circumstances.<br />\n\"The position should be open<br />\nto the student body and not just<br />\not those who attended the<br />\nworkshops,\" Lewin asserted.<br />\n\"EAch applicant will be<br /><br />\nlooked at as anyone else.\"<br />\nAnother issue that the SC<br />\nChairman and his Committee<br />\nmembers will have to contend<br />\nwith is the situation of having<br />\none of its members applying for<br />\nthee position on whichshe will<br />\nhave a deciding vote.<br />\n\"Shep Hoffman and I brought<br />\nup the issue that Sue Matson<br />\nconsider resigning from the<br />\nSElections Committee at last<br />\nTuesday's SC meeting,\"<br />\ncontinued Lewin.<br />\n\"I was concerned over the<br />\ncredibility of the Council if they<br />\nbacked any member who pursued<br />\na student position during their<br />\nSC term. At last Tuesday's<br />\nmeeting, everyone backed her<br />\n100%.\"<br />\nAs for last fall's Orientation,<br />\nLewin stated that the Union had<br />\nfelt \"too many hass1;,ss behind the<br />\nscenes\" and complained of an<br />\noverall lack of organization,<br />\nthough execution of the<br />\nweek-long activities went<br />\nrelatively well.<br />\nLewin stated that Sapakie had<br />\nexpressed concern over the<br />\ndistribution of authority and felt<br />\nthat \"not enough people had<br />\ngotten involved in Orientation.\"<br /><br />\nHe accused George S. Benton,<br />\nVice-President for Homewood<br />\nDivisions and chairman of the<br />\nEnergy Committee, of \"using the<br />\ncommittee as a rubber stamp for<br />\nhis own policies.\" He added,<br />\n\"Every one on the committee is<br />\nbeing abused.\"<br />\nShep Hoffmann, Senior Class<br />\nPresident, pointed out that any<br />\nUniversity closing was a de facto<br />\nincrease in tuition for the<br />\nHopkins student population.\"We<br />\nare not prepared to sanction a<br />\nshutdown to save the University<br />\nmoney,\" he declared and SAvitz<br />\npromptly seconded him.<br />\nLater these concerns gave way<br />\nto the fear, expressed by Bob<br />\nLewin, Selections Committee<br />\nchairman, that the selection of<br />\nSusan Matson, Junior Class<br />\nrepresentative, as Orientation<br />\nchairman for next fall would<br />\nexpose her and the Selections<br />\nCommittee of which she is a<br />\nmember to charges of conflicting<br />\ninterst, and favoritism.<br /><br />\nInformed<br />\nLewin was supported by<br />\nHoffmann in suggesting that<br />\nMatson might better resign from<br />\nher position on the Committee,<br />\n\"smelling not like a rose but with<br />\nno odor at all.\"<br />\nMatson evidently was<br />\nuncomfortable with her position<br />\nand appeared reluctant to leave<br />\nthe Selections Committee. Most<br />\nStudent Council members saw<br />\nlittle reason to dispute her. Ben<br />\nMansfield, Senior Class<br />\nrepresentative, noted that a<br />\nCouncil decision on this matter<br />\nwould set a precedent. In<br />\nparticular, she said, the<br />\nrepurcussions might be felt by<br />\nSavitz himself who has indicated<br />\ninterest in presenting a topic for<br />\nthe Eisenhower Symposium. The<br />\nsame point was not lost on<br />\nSAvitz who gave the chair to<br />\nJohn Colmers, Vice-President , to<br />\npreside over the rest of the<br />\ndiscussion.<br />\nThe question was in the end<br />\nleft to the Selections Committee<br />\nitself to decide.<br /><br />\npage 4/news-letter/february 8, 1974<br /><br />\nDr. Paulson named to Mellon chair in the Humanities<br />\nDr. Ronald Paulson, chairman<br />\nof the English Department, has<br />\nbeen named to the newly<br />\nestablished Andrew W.

The<br />\nappointment of a scholar of<br />\nRonald Paulson's stature to an<br />\nendowed chair in this field<br />\nrepresents a major step toward<br />\nthat goal,\" commented President<br />\nMuller.<br />\nPaulson, who has been a<br /><br />\nGUS to act later on add-drop<br />\nCUS, from page 1<br />\nstudents lobby with members of<br />\nthe CUS, especially the students,<br />\nto indicated their approval of the<br />\nAdd-Drop proposal.<br />\nThe Sub-committee of the<br />\nCUS on the Freshman grading<br />\npolicy will probably submit its<br />\nreport and recommendation on<br />\nwhether to change that policy at<br /><br />\nthe CUS's next meeting, said<br />\nHoffman, a member of that<br />\nsub-committee.<br />\nThe possibility of making<br />\nintersession courses strictly for<br />\nno credit will in all likelihood, be<br />\ndiscussed in a meeting of the<br />\nFaculty General Assmebly today<br />\nand then be referred to the CUS,<br />\nHoffman noted. Therefore, the<br /><br />\nSymposium conflict looms<br />\nSAVITZ, from page 1<br />\nSymposium matter if he should<br />\nsubmit a topic, Savitz stated, \"I<br />\ndon't care about a conflict of<br />\ninterest because there isn't one\"<br />\nIf he does submit a proposal,<br />\nhe reportedly intends to offer it<br />\nwith junior Susan Blum as<br />\nco-chairman, and he said<br />\nyesterday, \"I don't think Sue's<br /><br />\n&amp; sge of<br />\nOrigilai<br />\ngraphics<br />\niOr<br /><br />\nchances for doing it should be<br />\nhurt because of me.\"<br />\nHe stated last week that if his<br />\nproposal for the Symposium is<br />\nselected by the Committee and<br />\nchosen by the undergraduate<br />\nreferendum, he will not run for<br />\nre-election to the Council<br />\nPresidency.

For<br />\nothers, very likely a bit more ambitious or a bit more<br />\ntalented than the average, the Hopkins experience can be<br />\na good deal more. That is certainly the case for many of<br />\nthe student leaders here, who get the opportunity to<br />\nspeak out on issues, to be near the powerful of the<br />\nUniversity, to have the feeling that perhaps they can<br />\naffect .the course of an institution.<br />\nIn a few cases, rare in a place where the population is<br />\nso tmisient as here,a student moves very' quicisly into a<br />\nposition of power and keeps it for a long while. Such is<br />\nplainly the case for Student Council Presieent Andrew W.<br />\nSavitz, presently considering either running for a third<br />\nterm as Council president or submitting a topic for the<br />\n1974 Eisenhower Symposium. Perhaps Savitz has been in<br />\na prominent position for too long, if his conduct, as he<br />\nconsiders his options for his final year as an<br />\nundergraduate here is any indication.<br />\nFor he has shown a marked insensitivity to the<br />\npotential conflict of interest that exists due to his<br />\nCouncil position and his possible submission of a<br />\nSymposium topic. The fact that he has been in a<br />\nposition the past two weeks to screen symposium topics<br />\nsubmitted to the Council through his post office box is<br />\nenough immediately to cast suspicion on any topic he<br />\nmight eventually propose as his own. Although it is true<br />\nthat Savitz has claimed no topics have come to his<br />\nmailbox, the potentialfor abuse of his office has existed;<br />\nto insure that no one will gain from that potentialabuse,<br />\nthe Council's Selection Committee should, out of hand,<br />\nreject any topic Savitz might submit today.<br /><br />\nhenry t. rowell<br />\nWe never met Henry T. Rowell, but we talked to him<br />\non the phone a couple of times toward the end of his<br />\ncareer.

The win further solidified<br />\nthe Jays' lead in the MAC<br />\nstandings, as they now enjoy a<br />\ntwo-game margin over their<br />\nclosest pursuers.<br />\nThe victory was a team effort<br />\nin every sense of the word, as<br />\neach player made a valuable<br />\ncontribution in putting down the<br />\nBears, now 94 overall. Rallying<br />\nfrom an early deficit, the Blue<br />\nJays relied on the hot hands of<br />\nGreg DeLong and Bobby<br />\nFreedman to keep them alive in<br />\nthe opening period, then used the<br />\nfirepower of Paul Spence and Bill<br />\nJews to come from behind once<br />\nmore for the victory. In addition,<br />\nthe excellent defensive work of<br />\nall four as well as Doug Campbell<br />\nrestrained a squad with a decided<br />\nphysical advantage.<br />\nz<br />\nts<br />\nIn the opening minutes of the z<br />\ncontest, Hopkins began with its<br />\ntypical sluggish and careless early<br />\nperformance. Fortunately for the<br />\nJays, Ursinus sought to capitalize<br />\non these lapses by being more<br />\naggressive, a strategy that netted<br />\ntheir center, George Kinek, four<br />\nfouls in the opening twelve<br />\nminutes. With the MAC's leading<br />\nrebounder on the bench, the<br />\nBears could do no better than<br />\nmatch Hopkins in turning the<br />\nball over. As Freedman's hand<br />\nwarmed, the Jays found<br />\nthemselves battling for the lead<br />\nonce again after having trailed by<br />\nas many as seven. Ursinus held a<br />\n35-31 halftime advantage, a<br /><br />\nremarkable feat for the Blue Jays<br />\nconsidering that Hopkins shot<br />\nonly 35% while the Bears hit<br />\n50%.<br />\nThe Jays made one alteration<br />\nin their lineup at the half,<br />\nstarting the 6-1 Spence in place<br />\nof the 6-6 Fender.
