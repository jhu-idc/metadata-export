The town of the Lowells<br />\nand the Cabots refuses to allow its citizens to read such naughty<br />\ndemoralizing books as \"An.American Tragedy,\" but, we dare say,<br />\nit has never refused its budding young geniuses the right to seek<br />\nother outlets for their pent-up literary enthusiasm. And this<br />\n(alas!) is just what the Press Club of our fair sisters has done.<br />\nIt has told all little G.oucherites that they may not, under penalty\u2014<br />\n\u2022 - well, we're not sure just what the penalty is\u2014to contribute to the<br />\nBlack and Blue Jay.<br />\n..The edict, which was so nastily unchivalrous as to mention<br />\nthe Jay specifically, said that Goucher girls might not contribute to<br />\nperiodicals of which a prototype did not exist at Goucher. Poor<br />\nAtlantic Monthly! And what is more, the ruling seems to have<br />\ncome about through the continued appearance in the Jay of drawings by Goucherites.<br />\nWe appeal to the Press- Club to rescind this cruel and vicious<br />\nordinance. What harm can there be in Goucher's helping to enliven and embellish the poor Jay? Certainly, it seems to us, glory<br />\nwill accrue to Goucher rather than be detracted from her by these<br />\ncontributions. We believe that the Club has erred, or at least has<br />\nbeen wearing smoked glasses.

We are glad to see that he is about to receive a tangible<br />\nindication of the high regard in which he is held on the campus.<br />\n<br />\nYES and NO<br />\nThere are beautiful scenes in Baltimore, if one forgets that<br />\nBaltimore is home; if one puts aside his naturally casual acceptance of familiar scenes, closes that take-it-for-granted unseeing<br />\neye, and looks about him with the eagerness of a stranger or a<br />\nreturning prodigal son. The method of achieving such an appreciative state is simple; fall in love in May, spend some soft, misty<br />\nevening with the object of your affections, and walk very slowly<br />\nhome at midnight. Then, I warrant, you will see. Walk through<br />\nEutaw Place, where stiff red tulips pierce the dim night with<br />\nawful loveliness, where trees hang new festoons of dusky lacy<br />\nleaves, where an iron swan spouts upright yvhispering water unceasingly from his slender throat ;\u2014sit for a moment on a bench<br />\nand look, and drink the exotic very warming wine of Spring, and<br />\nnight, and a city's old loveliness; for there is a charm in Eutaw<br />\nPlace at midnight, when only an occasional motor car brings back<br />\nthe .hideous remembrance of the maddening crowd, and over<br />\none,\u2014pervasive, subtle as the intangible sensation a whiff of lilac<br />\nbrings, restful as death on a bed of crushed violet, or sleep on<br />\nthe trembling fragrant bosom, of the heart's desire, while the<br />\ntumbling tumult of her hair brushes your weary eyelids, caresses<br />\nyour forehead from frowns to. pleasant intangible dreamings-over one there creeps a quiet ecstasy of detachment, safety, peace.<br />\nThere are many white stone steps in certain of the unique<br />\n\"neighborhoods\" of ffaltimore. In Spring they are rather cold<br />\nto sit on after sun-set, unless the damsel fetches a cushion;. but<br />\nthey are invariably spotless (in certain neighborhoods) and made<br />\nof virgin marble,\u2014or perhaps very respectably married marble,<br />\nfor they have a staid and proper look\u2014and their whiteness is cool<br />\nand restful to the eyes under the fluctuating light of street-lamps.<br />\nAbove these lamps the green leaves hang. There is one such<br />\ncombination that I love very dearly,\u2014not because of anything<br />\nthat occurred on the steps beneath it, but because* of its very<br />\nfamiliarity, because of the unfailing thrill brought by each<br />\nSpring's recognition of the same leaves hovering over the same<br />\nsmall flame. I have always thought of that particular flame as<br />\nwithout heat, because the eager foliage forever seems to woo it,<br />\nbending against its stolid impregnable globe with a graceful<br />\nsophisticated caress. The lamp never puffs in a tremor of excitement, nor do the gentle twigs sacrifice their poise, except occasionally when a passionate May storm whips their emotions to a<br />\nfrenzy. . . . And the habit of adoration grows year by year, in<br />\nmy romance self as well as in the soul of that romantic tree, so<br />\nthat wandering wordlessly homeward at some tiny hour of a<br />\nSpring night, I unfailingly catch my breath at the ineffable cool,<br />\nclean, very green grace of the lea:yes, and the lambent hazy light<br />\nof the worshipful lamp.<br />\n_<br />\n.. . two contributions from J.

The town of the Lowells<br />\nand the Cabots refuses to allow its citizens to read such naughty<br />\ndemoralizing books as \"An.American Tragedy,\" but, we dare say,<br />\nit has never refused its budding young geniuses the right to seek<br />\nother outlets for their pent-up literary enthusiasm. And this<br />\n(alas!) is just what the Press Club of our fair sisters has done.<br />\nIt has told all little G.oucherites that they may not, under penalty\u2014<br />\n\u2022 - well, we're not sure just what the penalty is\u2014to contribute to the<br />\nBlack and Blue Jay.<br />\n..The edict, which was so nastily unchivalrous as to mention<br />\nthe Jay specifically, said that Goucher girls might not contribute to<br />\nperiodicals of which a prototype did not exist at Goucher. Poor<br />\nAtlantic Monthly! And what is more, the ruling seems to have<br />\ncome about through the continued appearance in the Jay of drawings by Goucherites.<br />\nWe appeal to the Press- Club to rescind this cruel and vicious<br />\nordinance. What harm can there be in Goucher's helping to enliven and embellish the poor Jay? Certainly, it seems to us, glory<br />\nwill accrue to Goucher rather than be detracted from her by these<br />\ncontributions. We believe that the Club has erred, or at least has<br />\nbeen wearing smoked glasses. Let's all be friends: how about it?<br /><br />\nFATHER BILL<br />\nThe movement_ undertaken by the lacrosse team to secure<br />\nto \"Father Bill\" Schmeisser<br />\n\u2022 sufficient funds to present<br />\n_ a gift<br />\nthat will be commensurate with his long service to the University<br />\nis one worthy of much commendation. \"Father Bill\", like \"Pop\"<br />\nSwindell, has given his time and his invaluable advice to the team<br />\nyear after year, and has consistently declined to accept a salary<br />\nof any sort.<br />\nNo wordy panegyric is needed to inform Hopkins people of<br />\n\"Father Bill's\" contribution to Hopkins' lacrosse success. That<br />\n\u2022 all know. We are glad to see that he is about to receive a tangible<br />\nindication of the high regard in which he is held on the campus.<br /><br />\nYES and NO<br />\nThere are beautiful scenes in Baltimore, if one forgets that<br />\nBaltimore is home; if one puts aside his naturally casual acceptance of familiar scenes, closes that take-it-for-granted unseeing<br />\neye, and looks about him with the eagerness of a stranger or a<br />\nreturning prodigal son. The method of achieving such an appreciative state is simple; fall in love in May, spend some soft, misty<br />\nevening with the object of your affections, and walk very slowly<br />\nhome at midnight. Then, I warrant, you will see. Walk through<br />\nEutaw Place, where stiff red tulips pierce the dim night with<br />\nawful loveliness, where trees hang new festoons of dusky lacy<br />\nleaves, where an iron swan spouts upright yvhispering water unceasingly from his slender throat ;\u2014sit for a moment on a bench<br />\nand look, and drink the exotic very warming wine of Spring, and<br />\nnight, and a city's old loveliness; for there is a charm in Eutaw<br />\nPlace at midnight, when only an occasional motor car brings back<br />\nthe .hideous remembrance of the maddening crowd, and over<br />\none,\u2014pervasive, subtle as the intangible sensation a whiff of lilac<br />\nbrings, restful as death on a bed of crushed violet, or sleep on<br />\nthe trembling fragrant bosom, of the heart's desire, while the<br />\ntumbling tumult of her hair brushes your weary eyelids, caresses<br />\nyour forehead from frowns to. pleasant intangible dreamings-over one there creeps a quiet ecstasy of detachment, safety, peace.<br />\nThere are many white stone steps in certain of the unique<br />\n\"neighborhoods\" of ffaltimore. In Spring they are rather cold<br />\nto sit on after sun-set, unless the damsel fetches a cushion;. but<br />\nthey are invariably spotless (in certain neighborhoods) and made<br />\nof virgin marble,\u2014or perhaps very respectably married marble,<br />\nfor they have a staid and proper look\u2014and their whiteness is cool<br />\nand restful to the eyes under the fluctuating light of street-lamps.<br />\nAbove these lamps the green leaves hang. There is one such<br />\ncombination that I love very dearly,\u2014not because of anything<br />\nthat occurred on the steps beneath it, but because* of its very<br />\nfamiliarity, because of the unfailing thrill brought by each<br />\nSpring's recognition of the same leaves hovering over the same<br />\nsmall flame. I have always thought of that particular flame as<br />\nwithout heat, because the eager foliage forever seems to woo it,<br />\nbending against its stolid impregnable globe with a graceful<br />\nsophisticated caress. The lamp never puffs in a tremor of excitement, nor do the gentle twigs sacrifice their poise, except occasionally when a passionate May storm whips their emotions to a<br />\nfrenzy. . . . And the habit of adoration grows year by year, in<br />\nmy romance self as well as in the soul of that romantic tree, so<br />\nthat wandering wordlessly homeward at some tiny hour of a<br />\nSpring night, I unfailingly catch my breath at the ineffable cool,<br />\nclean, very green grace of the lea:yes, and the lambent hazy light<br />\nof the worshipful lamp.<br />\n_<br />\n.. . two contributions from J.
