Singewald, Jr.,<br />\nassociate in economic geology at<br />\nJohns Hopkins University, has just<br />\nreturned from a seven months' tour<br />\nof South and Central America,<br />\nbringing with him the most valuable collection of South American<br />\nores that has ever been brought<br />\ntogether at one time. He was accompanied on the trip by Prof.<br />\nBenjamin L. Miller, of Lehigh<br />\nUniversity, a graduate in geology<br />\nof this University.<br />\nThe purpose of the trip was to<br />\nmake a study of the ore deposits<br />\nof Latin America. In the course<br />\nof the trip, Professor Singewald<br />\nvisited practically all of the most<br />\nimportant mines of the countries<br />\nthrough which he passed.<br />\nIn addition to the value of this<br />\nmaterial for museum and lecture<br />\nPurposes, much of it is of scientific<br />\nimportance, It includes fossils<br />\nfrom two series of rocks in Bolivia<br />\nin which fossils had never before<br />\nbeen found, whose study is expected to throw great light upon the<br />\ngeological history of the Andes.<br />\nData was also collected from the<br />\nnitrate fields of Chile which will<br />\nProbably help to settle the vexatious problem of their origin. Results bearing on the problems of<br />\nore genesis are expected from the<br />\nlaboratory investigations of the ore<br />\nspecimens.<br />\nSouth America has the most<br />\nvaried mineral deposits of all the<br />\ncontinents, and many mineralogical<br />\nspecimens of particular value were<br />\nobtained. Among the most striking additions to the mineral collections of the University are large<br />\nspecimens of native bismuth from<br />\nHuayna Potosi, near La Paz, Bolivia, a mineral that is only found<br />\nin small quantities elsewhere; a<br />\nmagnificent specimen of silver ore<br />\nfrom near Cerro de Pasco, Peru;<br />\narborescent bunches of native copner from Coroco, Bolivia; and<br />\ngreat quantities of the otherwise<br />\nrare oxidized basic copper ores that<br />\noccur so abundantly in the Atacama<br />\ndesert in Chile.<br />\nDr. Singewald was much impressed with the \u2022important position<br />\nthat South America deserves and is<br />\nrapidly establishing for herself as a<br />\ncontributor to the world's supply<br />\nof metals. Her progress in this<br />\nspect is shown by the number of<br />\nPoints in which she holds first place.<br />\nDr. Singewald also came into contact in every region which he visited with the activities of foreign<br />\nnations in the development of the<br />\ncountry.<br />\n<br />\nThe annual freshman-sophomore<br />\nfootball game, played Saturday at<br />\nHomewood, ended in a scoreless tie.<br />\nIt was a hard-fought battle throughout, with the sophomores perhaps<br />\nhaving a little the better of the argument. The play was in freshman<br />\nterritory practically the whole game,<br />\nthe second-year men twice getting<br />\nwithin striking distance of the freshmen's goal. But the sophomores<br />\nlacked the punch at the critical moments, and the first-year men were<br />\nable to keep their goal line untouched.<br />\nHoffman had two chances to<br />\ndrop-kick, but both attempts went<br />\nfar from their mark. At the end<br />\nof the first half the sophomores<br />\nwere close to the goal line, but instead of attempting a drop-kick the<br />\nsecond-year men tried for a touchdown and were held for downs by<br />\nthe freshies on their i-yard line.<br />\nThe contest started off with a<br />\nrush. Hoffman kicked off. The<br />\nsophs were very fast getting down<br />\nthe field and a general scramble for<br />\nthe ball ensued. A first-year man<br />\nfinally fell on it. They failed to<br />\ngain, and on the fourth down Frock<br />\nkick ed to Hoffman. Duncan<br />\nplunged through center and made it<br />\nfirst down. In three successive<br />\nrushes Hoffman netted twenty-two<br />\nyards, but after each gain his team<br />\nwas penalized, and he was forced<br />\nto kick.<br />\nHere ensued a kicking duel between Frock and Hoffman, the<br />\nquarter ending with the ball in the<br />\nfreshmen's possession.<br />\nAt the beginning of the second<br />\nquarter, the freshmen were forced<br />\nto kick. Cort missed the ball and<br />\na freshman fell on it. The freshmen then tried a trick play, which<br />\nonly netted them five yards. The<br />\nball went over on downs.<br />\nHoffman and Duncan now alternated in carrying the ball, and were<br />\nable to advance within a yard of<br />\nthe goal line, but here the freshies<br />\ntook a brace and held them on the<br />\nfourth down. Frock kicked out of<br />\ndanger. The sophs tried a forward<br />\npass, but missed out by a small<br />\nmargin.<br />\nThe half ended with the ball almost in the center of the field.<br />\nThe third quarter consisted mainly of a kicking duel between Hoffman and Frock, with the advantage<br />\nslightly in the soph's favor.<br />\nThe fourth quarter almost saw<br />\na sophomore victory. Repeated<br />\ngains by Duncan and Hoffman<br />\nbrought the ball under the freshies'<br />\n<br />\nDr. Robert Wood, Johns Hopkins' celebrated professor of experimental physics, has just retttrned to the University after<br />\nmaking a successful series of experiments at the Mt. Wilson Observatory, situated at Pasadena,<br />\nCal. Dr. Wood's visit to California<br />\nwas primarily for the purpose of<br />\nphotographing the moon through<br />\nthe powerful 60-inch telescope on<br />\nMt. Wilson. However, so much<br />\nmore material for study was found<br />\namong the planets that Dr. Wood<br />\nchanged his intentions and spent<br />\nmost of his time photographing<br />\nthem instead of the 1110011.<br />\nIn his work, Dr. Wood photographed the moon, Mars, Jupiter<br />\nand Saturn with the aid of yellow<br />\nlight and the ultra-violet and infrared rays. It was found that substances that could be photographed<br />\nby means of ultra-violet rays were<br />\nat times not shown on the plates<br />\ntaken with the infra-red rays. For<br />\nexample, on the ultra-violet photographs Saturn showed a broad,<br />\ndark belt around the equator that<br />\ncould not be seen on the proofs of<br />\nthe infra-red photographs. Differences in the polar caps and the<br />\nrings of Saturn were also noticed.<br />\nDr. Wood explained these phenomena by saying that the atmosphere of the planet possibly contained finely-divided dust or some<br />\ngas that was opaque to one kind of<br />\nray and transparent to another.<br />\nJupiter, as well as Saturn,<br />\nshowed such differences. In order<br />\nto discover the nature, of the materials that photograph so differently<br />\nunder the various rays, it will be<br />\nnecessary, Dr. Wood says, to make<br />\nfurther investigations. This is now<br />\nbeing done at the California observatory.<br />\nIn photographing with the infrared and the ultra-violet rays,<br />\nscreens have to be arranged that<br />\nexclude all except the particular<br />\nkind of ray to, be used. In the<br />\nuse of the ultra-violet rays the<br />\nlight is filtered by means of a glass<br />\ncell, closed by quartz and containing bromine vapor.<br />\nDr. Wood is particularly pleased<br />\nwith the results of these experiments. It is unknown yet just<br />\nwhat importance these facts will<br />\nhave on our ideas of the planets;<br />\nbut, at any rate, Dr. Wood's observations are the first of their kind,<br />\nand to Dr. Wood belongs the credit<br />\nof the discoveries.<br />\n<br />\nHopkins men were very much in<br />\nevidence at the mass-meeting for<br />\nnational defense, held at the Lyric<br />\nSaturday night. The ushers and<br />\nmany of the vice-presidents were<br />\nrepresentatives of the University,<br />\nand there were many Hopkins men<br />\nin the audience. Governor Goldsborough presided over the meeting.<br />\nMr. James M. Beck was the principal speaker of the evening. In<br />\nthe course of his speech, he read<br />\nan extract from an article which he<br />\nsaid was written by a professor at<br />\nJohns Hoplcins.<br />\nHe attacked American colleges,<br />\ncalling them \"mere social clubs.\"<br />\nHe said that in the teaching of<br />\nAmerican history the points that<br />\nwe could not feel proud of were<br />\nomitted, while the bright points<br />\nwere dwelt upon. A college degree<br />\nshould not be granted, he declared,<br />\nunless the student had the knowledge of both the good and the bad<br />\nparts of American history. He said<br />\nhe would like to try an experiment<br />\non a hundred students composed of<br />\nthe ten brightest students from each<br />\nof the ten leading colleges. He<br />\nsaid he was willing to wager that<br />\nof this number not more than one<br />\ncould correctly answer when America first received help from France.<br />\nHe favored a standing army of<br />\n550,000 men, which number, although only about one-quarter of<br />\nthe size of the standing armies of<br />\nGermany and France, he thought<br />\nsufficient to protect our shores. As<br />\nto our coast defenses, he pointed out<br />\nthat they were strong enough to<br />\nresist a direct attack from the front,<br />\nbut that as the guns could not be<br />\nreversed they would easily fall if<br />\nattacked from the rear by a land<br />\nforce.<br />\nHe favored international arbitration, not because he believed it<br />\nwould do away with war, but because it would minimize the chance<br />\nfor war.<br />\nMr.William Marbury spoke next.<br />\nFollowing his address, a telegram<br />\nfrom Theodore Roosevelt, complimenting the patriotic spirit of<br />\nMaryland, was read by Governor<br />\nGoldsborough.<br />\n<br />\n(Continued on page 8, col. 2)<br />\n<br />\nThe alumni of the University of<br />\nNew York have resumed their campaign to raise a million dollars for<br />\nthe financial support of the university.

The freshman-sophomore contest on Saturday marked<br />\nthe close of a football career that,<br />\nstarting at City College three years<br />\nago, gradually ascended until this<br />\nseason it lifted Hoffman head and<br />\nshoulders above every other halfback in the State, and even placed<br />\nhim in the same ranks as the best<br />\nmen of the larger college teams.<br />\nThis came rather as a surprise.<br />\nExcept for having his wind knocked<br />\nout for a few minutes in the recent St. John's game, Hoffman<br />\nhas never been hurt or knocked<br />\nunconscious during his whole football career. He has always trained<br />\nfaithfully and this, combined, with<br />\na solid, sturdy build, has kept him<br />\nsafe from all ordinary injuries. He<br />\nknows how to fall when tackled,<br />\nand can be hurled hard against the<br />\nground and become the bottom of<br />\na struggling, fighting mass without<br />\nbeing hurt in the least.<br />\nBut in spite of this, Hoffman<br />\nhas decided not to play again. Although his parents have not absolutely forbidden him to play, still<br />\nHoffman, knowing that they strongly object, has determined to do as<br />\nthey wish him to and give up the<br />\ngame.<br />\nWith Hoffman out of the game,<br />\nnext year's team will have difficulty<br />\nin finding a back who can run and<br />\nkick as Hoffman can. Bobby has<br />\nequaled the best in this country in<br />\ndrop-kicking. It is safe to say that<br />\nfew, if any, other college men in<br />\nthe United States can surpass this<br />\nHopkins player in the precision,<br />\nspeed and distance of his kicks.<br />\nBesides drop-kicking, Hoffman has<br />\ndone all the punting for Hopkins<br />\nthis year, and in almost every game<br />\nfar outdistanced his opponents. As<br />\na broken-field runner and as a line<br />\nplunger Bobby held his own with<br />\nany man in the State.<br />\nHopkins' football .will suffer, but<br />\nthen the Black and Blue will still<br />\nhave Hoffman on the lacrosse team.<br />\nHere he is also a shining light, being one of the steadiest defense<br />\nmen Hopkins has had for years,<br />\nand this somewhat helps us to forget his loss to the football team.<br />\n<br />\nPittsburgh or Cornell, Which?<br />\n<br />\nWho won the Eastern inter-collegiate football championship, PittsPittsburgh<br />\nburgh or Cornell?<br />\nthinks it has a right to the title<br />\nand has issued a challenge to Cornell asking that a game be played<br />\nbetween the two colleges sometime<br />\nwithin the next two weeks. It is<br />\nnot likely that Cornell will play<br />\nPitt, as her players have already<br />\nbroken training and it would take<br />\ntime to get them again into prime<br />\ncondition.<br />\nHarvard is also ready to dispute<br />\nfor the championship, claiming that<br />\nher team was not playing in its<br />\nusual form when it met Cornell.<br />\nSyracuse also had a team of<br />\nchampionship ability, and would<br />\nhave been a strong contender for<br />\nthe title if she had not been nosed<br />\nout by Princeton by a close score.<br />\n<br />\nBruce Williams and Edgar Fell,of Political Economy Department, Leave<br />\nwith Peace Delegation of<br />\nAutomobile King.<br />\n<br />\nBruce Williams and Edgar Fell.<br />\ngraduate students in the political<br />\nscience department of this University, sailed Saturday with Mr.<br />\nHenry Ford on the Oscar II for<br />\nEurope.

'They will eat Bagley's<br />\nteam up.\"<br />\nNo date for the contest has as<br />\nyet been set, as Brickley's eligibility<br />\nhas not been fully conceded by the<br />\nindependents. The game will probably take place next week, however, and, with favorable climatic<br />\nconditions, a record-breaking crowd<br />\nis expected to be present.<br />\nThe rival line-ups follow:<br />\nHomewoods\u2014Wilkinson, center;<br />\nLeibensperger, right forward;<br />\nBrickley, left forward; Brinton,<br />\nright guard; Schmidt, left guard.<br />\nIndependents \u2014 Bagley, center;<br />\nBranham, right forward; Pfitsch,<br />\nleft forward; Brooks, right guard;<br />\nMartindale, left guard.<br />\nTimekeepers\u2014C.

The plan<br />\nproposed for the removal of the<br />\nbooks is that boxes just as long as<br />\nthe shelves of the library be constructed and that entire shelves of<br />\nbooks conveyed to Homewood intact. This will avoid confusion of<br />\nthe books and will facilitate the task<br />\nof replacing them on the shelves of<br />\nthe new library.<br />\nAt the time set for the removal<br />\nthe examinations will be about over<br />\nand most of the books will be available. Owing to the fact that the<br />\nsummer session will be held in<br />\nMcCoy Hall this year, some of the<br />\nbooks will have to be left; these will<br />\nbe shelved in the main reading-room<br />\nwhile needed by the summer students.<br />\nPresent circumstances forecast<br />\nthe successful carrying out of all<br />\nplans.

He was accompanied on the trip by Prof.<br />\nBenjamin L.

Among the most striking additions to the mineral collections of the University are large<br />\nspecimens of native bismuth from<br />\nHuayna Potosi, near La Paz, Bolivia, a mineral that is only found<br />\nin small quantities elsewhere; a<br />\nmagnificent specimen of silver ore<br />\nfrom near Cerro de Pasco, Peru;<br />\narborescent bunches of native copner from Coroco, Bolivia; and<br />\ngreat quantities of the otherwise<br />\nrare oxidized basic copper ores that<br />\noccur so abundantly in the Atacama<br />\ndesert in Chile.<br />\nDr. Singewald was much impressed with the \u2022important position<br />\nthat South America deserves and is<br />\nrapidly establishing for herself as a<br />\ncontributor to the world's supply<br />\nof metals. Her progress in this<br />\nspect is shown by the number of<br />\nPoints in which she holds first place.<br />\nDr. Singewald also came into contact in every region which he visited with the activities of foreign<br />\nnations in the development of the<br />\ncountry.<br /><br />\nThe annual freshman-sophomore<br />\nfootball game, played Saturday at<br />\nHomewood, ended in a scoreless tie.<br />\nIt was a hard-fought battle throughout, with the sophomores perhaps<br />\nhaving a little the better of the argument. The play was in freshman<br />\nterritory practically the whole game,<br />\nthe second-year men twice getting<br />\nwithin striking distance of the freshmen's goal. But the sophomores<br />\nlacked the punch at the critical moments, and the first-year men were<br />\nable to keep their goal line untouched.<br />\nHoffman had two chances to<br />\ndrop-kick, but both attempts went<br />\nfar from their mark. At the end<br />\nof the first half the sophomores<br />\nwere close to the goal line, but instead of attempting a drop-kick the<br />\nsecond-year men tried for a touchdown and were held for downs by<br />\nthe freshies on their i-yard line.<br />\nThe contest started off with a<br />\nrush. Hoffman kicked off. The<br />\nsophs were very fast getting down<br />\nthe field and a general scramble for<br />\nthe ball ensued. A first-year man<br />\nfinally fell on it. They failed to<br />\ngain, and on the fourth down Frock<br />\nkick ed to Hoffman. Duncan<br />\nplunged through center and made it<br />\nfirst down. In three successive<br />\nrushes Hoffman netted twenty-two<br />\nyards, but after each gain his team<br />\nwas penalized, and he was forced<br />\nto kick.<br />\nHere ensued a kicking duel between Frock and Hoffman, the<br />\nquarter ending with the ball in the<br />\nfreshmen's possession.<br />\nAt the beginning of the second<br />\nquarter, the freshmen were forced<br />\nto kick. Cort missed the ball and<br />\na freshman fell on it. The freshmen then tried a trick play, which<br />\nonly netted them five yards. The<br />\nball went over on downs.<br />\nHoffman and Duncan now alternated in carrying the ball, and were<br />\nable to advance within a yard of<br />\nthe goal line, but here the freshies<br />\ntook a brace and held them on the<br />\nfourth down. Frock kicked out of<br />\ndanger. The sophs tried a forward<br />\npass, but missed out by a small<br />\nmargin.<br />\nThe half ended with the ball almost in the center of the field.<br />\nThe third quarter consisted mainly of a kicking duel between Hoffman and Frock, with the advantage<br />\nslightly in the soph's favor.<br />\nThe fourth quarter almost saw<br />\na sophomore victory. Repeated<br />\ngains by Duncan and Hoffman<br />\nbrought the ball under the freshies'<br /><br />\nDr. Robert Wood, Johns Hopkins' celebrated professor of experimental physics, has just retttrned to the University after<br />\nmaking a successful series of experiments at the Mt. Wilson Observatory, situated at Pasadena,<br />\nCal. Dr. Wood's visit to California<br />\nwas primarily for the purpose of<br />\nphotographing the moon through<br />\nthe powerful 60-inch telescope on<br />\nMt. Wilson. However, so much<br />\nmore material for study was found<br />\namong the planets that Dr. Wood<br />\nchanged his intentions and spent<br />\nmost of his time photographing<br />\nthem instead of the 1110011.<br />\nIn his work, Dr. Wood photographed the moon, Mars, Jupiter<br />\nand Saturn with the aid of yellow<br />\nlight and the ultra-violet and infrared rays. It was found that substances that could be photographed<br />\nby means of ultra-violet rays were<br />\nat times not shown on the plates<br />\ntaken with the infra-red rays. For<br />\nexample, on the ultra-violet photographs Saturn showed a broad,<br />\ndark belt around the equator that<br />\ncould not be seen on the proofs of<br />\nthe infra-red photographs. Differences in the polar caps and the<br />\nrings of Saturn were also noticed.<br />\nDr. Wood explained these phenomena by saying that the atmosphere of the planet possibly contained finely-divided dust or some<br />\ngas that was opaque to one kind of<br />\nray and transparent to another.<br />\nJupiter, as well as Saturn,<br />\nshowed such differences. In order<br />\nto discover the nature, of the materials that photograph so differently<br />\nunder the various rays, it will be<br />\nnecessary, Dr. Wood says, to make<br />\nfurther investigations. This is now<br />\nbeing done at the California observatory.<br />\nIn photographing with the infrared and the ultra-violet rays,<br />\nscreens have to be arranged that<br />\nexclude all except the particular<br />\nkind of ray to, be used. In the<br />\nuse of the ultra-violet rays the<br />\nlight is filtered by means of a glass<br />\ncell, closed by quartz and containing bromine vapor.<br />\nDr. Wood is particularly pleased<br />\nwith the results of these experiments. It is unknown yet just<br />\nwhat importance these facts will<br />\nhave on our ideas of the planets;<br />\nbut, at any rate, Dr. Wood's observations are the first of their kind,<br />\nand to Dr. Wood belongs the credit<br />\nof the discoveries.<br /><br />\nHopkins men were very much in<br />\nevidence at the mass-meeting for<br />\nnational defense, held at the Lyric<br />\nSaturday night.

The freshman-sophomore contest on Saturday marked<br />\nthe close of a football career that,<br />\nstarting at City College three years<br />\nago, gradually ascended until this<br />\nseason it lifted Hoffman head and<br />\nshoulders above every other halfback in the State, and even placed<br />\nhim in the same ranks as the best<br />\nmen of the larger college teams.<br />\nThis came rather as a surprise.<br />\nExcept for having his wind knocked<br />\nout for a few minutes in the recent St. John's game, Hoffman<br />\nhas never been hurt or knocked<br />\nunconscious during his whole football career. He has always trained<br />\nfaithfully and this, combined, with<br />\na solid, sturdy build, has kept him<br />\nsafe from all ordinary injuries. He<br />\nknows how to fall when tackled,<br />\nand can be hurled hard against the<br />\nground and become the bottom of<br />\na struggling, fighting mass without<br />\nbeing hurt in the least.<br />\nBut in spite of this, Hoffman<br />\nhas decided not to play again.

Bobby has<br />\nequaled the best in this country in<br />\ndrop-kicking. It is safe to say that<br />\nfew, if any, other college men in<br />\nthe United States can surpass this<br />\nHopkins player in the precision,<br />\nspeed and distance of his kicks.<br />\nBesides drop-kicking, Hoffman has<br />\ndone all the punting for Hopkins<br />\nthis year, and in almost every game<br />\nfar outdistanced his opponents. As<br />\na broken-field runner and as a line<br />\nplunger Bobby held his own with<br />\nany man in the State.<br />\nHopkins' football .will suffer, but<br />\nthen the Black and Blue will still<br />\nhave Hoffman on the lacrosse team.<br />\nHere he is also a shining light, being one of the steadiest defense<br />\nmen Hopkins has had for years,<br />\nand this somewhat helps us to forget his loss to the football team.<br /><br />\nPittsburgh or Cornell, Which?<br /><br />\nWho won the Eastern inter-collegiate football championship, PittsPittsburgh<br />\nburgh or Cornell?<br />\nthinks it has a right to the title<br />\nand has issued a challenge to Cornell asking that a game be played<br />\nbetween the two colleges sometime<br />\nwithin the next two weeks.

Captain Bagley immediately<br />\nset about putting his men through a<br />\nmost rigorous drill, however, and<br />\nthey should now prove able to give<br />\nthe challengers a terrible fight for<br />\nhonors.
