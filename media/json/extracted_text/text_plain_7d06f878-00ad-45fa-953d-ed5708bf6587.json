Unfortunately, some of these are the ones<br />\nthat most concern students.<br />\nCase in point: this year's Student<br />\nCouncil Education Committee does not<br />\nconsist of petty politicos, but of enthusiastic, capable people who have already<br />\ninstituted a student referendum on plusminus grading and an extension - of the<br />\nstudent faculty advising period. This past<br />\nMonday night, however, the Education<br />\nCommittee attempted to tackle an outgrowth of one of the age-old problems at<br />\nJHU, and ran. into an equally old brick<br />\nwall. The outgrowth was that of growing<br />\nstudent discontent over teaching assistants<br />\nwho are unable to speak English. The<br />\nproblem underlying it is the excessively<br />\nhigh premium this University places on<br />\nresearch achievement by its faculty, at the<br />\nexpense of basic teaching and communication skills.<br />\nThe stereotype of the foreign<br />\nmath/sci whiz whose English-speaking<br />\nabilities render him functionally autistic is<br />\na much-exploited joke, but the fact is that<br />\nstudents in<br />\nintroductory<br />\ncourses are<br />\nrunning into TAs who can't communicate.<br />\nDean Hooker himself agrees that the<br />\n<br />\nsituation is \"scandalous\" (his word), but<br />\nrejects alternatives dutifully submitted<br />\nby the Education Committee. The bottom<br />\nline, he says, is money: the University<br />\ncannot afford to instruct its faculty in the<br />\nrudiments of English, nor will it pay<br />\nprofessors to pick up the teaching load<br />\ncurrently assumed by the TAs. But that's<br />\nokay, Hooker says, because Hopkins<br />\npublicizes the fact that it is not for<br />\neveryone,\" not a place where students<br />\ncome \"for individual attention, but for<br />\ncontact with top-level people.\" The old<br />\ntrickle down theory, in other words.<br />\nHooker is equally blunt about the<br />\nfact that the reason why non-Englishspeaking students are made TAs is that<br />\nthey are the best scholars.<br />\nOne can swallow these justifications<br />\non the graduate level, where contact with<br />\nthe big names is at least as important as<br />\ngood \"instruction,\" but one can only<br />\nregurgitate them on the undergraduate<br />\nlevel. Understanding basic information is<br />\nessential in introductory courses, particularly in math and science, which are already<br />\nforeign languages unto themselves. It's<br />\nhard enough for the math/sci concentrator<br />\nto deal with inarticulate TAs. but it<br />\nbecomes insult added to injury for a<br />\nnon-concentrator fulfilling a requirement.<br />\nThis is an area where change may be<br />\nnext to impossible without loud student<br />\nbelly-aching. The administration has previously buried some amazingly comprehensive Education Committee reports on the<br />\ndistribution of teaching load among professors and junior faculty, and on tenure, to<br />\nname just two hot topics. But we're paying<br />\nthousands of dollars for a top quality<br />\neducation, and it doesn't seem too much to<br />\nask that our teachers speak the language<br />\nat least as well as we do. We'll just have to<br />\nask louder, that's all.<br />\n<br />\n..1d Production<br />\nJean Preston<br />\nMargaret Lipschutz<br />\n<br />\nHelene Caloir<br />\n<br />\nCover by<br />\nDFG<br />\n0<br />\n<br />\n\u2022<br />\n<br />\nBourgeois Feminism:<br />\nNew Can Of Worms<br />\nThe actual realization of<br />\nequal rights for women (and I<br />\ndon't mean simply the ratification of the amendment) will<br />\nhave a profound influence on<br />\nsuch diverse topics as the economy, male-female relationships,<br />\nand human life-styles. If the<br />\nwomen's movement is shortsighted in its aims: such as<br />\nstriving only for female independence, the likely result is that<br />\nmale-female relationships will<br />\ngrow touchy, community structure will break down, and all of<br />\nus will find ourselves fallen prey<br />\nto the interests of the rich<br />\nbourgeoisie. Let me explain.<br />\nMale-female<br />\nrelationships<br />\nare changing fundamentally.<br />\nMarriage used - to be a power<br />\nrelationship \u2014 the woman need-<br />\n<br />\nNot So Secure<br />\nTo the Editor:<br />\n<br />\n\u2022<br />\n<br />\nBY WALTER HOOK<br />\n<br />\nLetters to the Editor<br />\n<br />\nsupport financially because<br />\nthe world was unwilling to let<br />\nher support herself. In order to<br />\nsurvive, the woman married, and<br />\nin doing so sacrificed much of<br />\nher freedom (actually, before<br />\nmarriage the woman was controlled by her parents). Ah ha!<br />\nSo now women are able to<br />\nsupport themselves, and many<br />\nare realizing that for them<br />\nmarriage, at least in the minds of<br />\ntheir husbands, means that they<br />\nmust sacrifice careers and social<br />\nlife. For both mean and women<br />\nmarriage often meant isolation<br />\nof the couple from friends.<br />\nThough this often led to stress in<br />\nthe relationship, usually their<br />\nmutual solitude or obligation to<br />\nchildren kept them together<br />\nuntil one or the other died,<br />\nleaving the other totally isolated.<br />\ncont. on p. 5<br />\ned<br />\n<br />\nI'd like to tell about two<br />\nincidents regarding myself and<br />\ncampus police that occurred last<br />\nyear(my freshman year). About<br />\nthis time last year, my dorm<br />\nroom was broken into by a<br />\nnon-student. Luckily, a maintenance person witnessed the<br />\nevent and dialed campus police.<br />\nOfficers arrived in seconds to<br />\napprehend the criminal.<br />\nDuring the course of the<br />\nyear I was required to appear in<br />\ncourt twice to present evidence<br />\nagainst the defendant (who by<br />\nthe way was convicted and<br />\nsentenced to three years in<br />\nprison). Each of those two days,<br />\na campus police officer assigned<br />\nto my case went out of his way<br />\nto drive me to court and back.<br />\nHe also stayed with me during<br />\nthe proceedings as I was quite<br />\nnervous.<br />\nI want to again express my<br />\nappreciation to the campus<br />\npolice for their quick action the<br />\nmorning of the crime. I would<br />\nalso like to thank the officer for<br />\n<br />\nhis assistance during the pretrial<br />\nhearing and during the trial.<br />\nAnother incident occurred<br />\nlast year involving a different<br />\nofficer, a friend, and myself. My<br />\nfriend had just switched dorm<br />\nrooms and I was helping him<br />\nmove his belongings. We were<br />\napproached by an officer and<br />\nquestioned for quite a length of<br />\ntime regarding the nature of the<br />\ncontents of the boxes we were<br />\ncarrying, where we were going,<br />\nand from where we came. He<br />\nthen searched the boxes (the<br />\nitems were pots, pans, dishes,<br />\nnonperishable food, etc.), and<br />\nordered us to show him our<br />\nidentification cards. He then<br />\nwrote down our names, dorm<br />\nrooms, and a description of the<br />\npots, pans, dishes, nonperishable<br />\nfood, etc. that we were carrying.<br />\nI understand that there may<br />\nhave been some concern and/or<br />\nsuspicion on his part regarding<br />\nour actions, but I feel that both<br />\nhis lengthy interrogation and his<br />\nsearch through the boxes were<br />\nunnecessary and embarrassing.<br />\nIf we were in the same place,<br />\nsame time, etc., but carrying<br />\ntextbooks and notebooks in-<br />\n<br />\nstead of pots, pans, dishes,<br />\nnonperishable food, etc., would<br />\nwe have been subjected to a<br />\nsimilar detainment and search?<br />\nDave Breznick<br />\nClass of 1984<br />\n<br />\nBowl Full O'RedTape.<br />\nEd. note: Just as we were<br />\ntucking ourselves in one night last<br />\nweek, there was a dreadful<br />\nclatter on the roof and the<br />\nfollowing bit of doggerel drifted<br />\ndown into the fireplace.

Once you<br />\ndecide whether to sit in the front row or<br />\nthe back row (your only choices), you<br />\nwill find yourself confronted by about<br />\nthe best serious theater Baltimore has to<br />\noffer. Aside from Center Stage and<br />\nTheater Hopkins, they are the only<br />\ncompany to present regularly a healthy<br />\nselection of the classics. Its most unique<br />\ncharacteristic is its size; seating a bare 50,<br />\nit brings the audience close enough to the<br />\nactors to see them think. This presents<br />\nthe cast with an unusual challenge to<br />\ntheir acting abilities, and one that they<br />\ntake on quite successfully.<br />\nThe Play is a funny thing; Pinter<br />\nshows us that life is absurd as it is painful.<br />\nThe play is a tormented cry from a<br />\nmodern world we can either choose not<br />\nto understand or choose to make sense<br />\nof.<br />\nPinter's method is to present a<br />\nflipped coin. On one side are the followers of the absurd theater who contend<br />\nthat the play should not be limited by<br />\ndramatic classification. Pinter himself<br />\ndislikes dramatic interpretation and rarely<br />\ncomments on the meaning of his works.<br />\nOn the other side are those<br />\npeople who need to fit this play into a<br />\narising out of the<br />\ncategorical scheme<br />\n19th-century drawing-room drama, or<br />\n<br />\nto giw Marxist interpretations to the petitbourgeois Pinter household.<br />\nBoth sides of the coin are correct.<br />\nThis is why the play is a \"theatrical<br />\nexperience\" different for each individual.<br />\nThe boundaries of interpretation are<br />\nlimited only by each person's capacity to<br />\n\"experience\" the play in his own mind.<br />\nIn short, the audience writes the play.<br />\nTo spite the play's vague structure, the dramatic situation is simple. A<br />\nman and his wife, well-to-do and well<br />\neducated, entertain a female friend,<br />\nwhom 20 years ago was the wife's roommate. From this, the conflict moves back<br />\nand forth in time, unfolding the past lives<br />\nof these people.<br />\nAt one time the roommates had a<br />\nlesbian relationship, and at one time the<br />\nvisiting girlfriend was the husband's lover.<br />\nWhen the past becomes present, their<br />\nrelationships become disturbingly intertwined. When the lesbian relationship<br />\nseems renewed the husband becomes<br />\nthreatened and backs himself into a trap<br />\nfrom which there is no escape.<br />\nIn the end the play becomes the<br />\npower of women to rip at the souls of<br />\ncallous men. A moment is relived where<br />\nthe wife refuses to comply sexually. The<br />\npresent becomes unbearable: the husband<br />\nbreaks down and is forced to turn his<br />\nback, escaping the female world.<br />\nOf course this is only one plausible interpretation constructed out of a<br />\nPinter montage. Old Times provides only<br />\nbits of data. Language is simple and<br />\noften without syntax or coherence.<br />\n<br />\nPauses are dark and have the power to<br />\nkill. Above all, time is incidental. This<br />\nis the beauty of the play: the audience is<br />\ncalled upon to make meaning out of a<br />\nmysterious world.<br />\nThe Fells Point Theater is an ideal<br />\nenvironment for Old Times, because of its<br />\n'small size. Each member of the audience<br />\ncan be intimately involved in the triangle<br />\nrelationship. In a play with so few lines,<br />\nfacial expressions and subtle eye contact<br />\nbecome major ways of understanding<br />\nthe drama.<br />\nThe performances of Elizabeth<br />\nRyan, King W. White III. and Gloria<br />\nHenderson are well executed. As the play<br />\nprogresses, their relationships become<br />\ntenuously defined. The anxiety building<br />\nbetween the performers is shared by the<br />\naudience. When the lights come on, in<br />\nthe final moments of the play, a dramatic<br />\nghostly truth forces the small audience to<br />\nface each other in the present.<br />\nThis is a memory play in which<br />\nthe memories of the past taint the reality<br />\nof the present. There is no one adequate<br />\nsolution to the mysteries. The more you<br />\ntry to make sense out of the production<br />\nthe more pleasure you get. In an age<br />\nwhen commercial theaters house audiences in the hundreds, the production is<br />\nan unusual opportunity for intimate<br />\ntheatrical collaboration.<br />\nThe Fells Point Theater Production of<br />\nOld Times runs through October 18.

Throughout<br />\nthe 1950s and, especially, the 1960s Wickwire practiced his own brand of activism at Hopkins which earned<br />\nhim a reputation as a controversial figure. He struggled<br />\nfor integration, for civil rights, and civil liberties within<br />\nthe University and outside in the community.<br />\nOver the years, Wickwire's efforts to promote the<br />\ncauses of political freedom and civil rights have often<br />\nbeen unappreciated, to say the least, by Hopkins and<br />\ncommunity people alike in times when such ideals were<br />\nnot generally accepted. Wickwire has been a liberal and<br />\nan activist at what is generally considered a quiet.<br />\nconservative university.<br />\nIn introducing Dr. Wickwire and his achievements at Hopkins, one must consider what some see<br />\nas. his conflicting religious and secular roles. Wickwire<br />\ndisputes, characterizations of his political views as<br />\n\"radical,\" and members of the University administration, faculty, and religious groups comment on his<br />\nperformance as chaplain.<br />\nWickwire's expressed goal as Chaplain at JHU is<br />\nto integrate the campus with the community around it.<br />\n\"There is a temptation for any kind of an institution<br />\nto sort of withdraw, and I think that in. a city like<br />\nBaltimore where you have, in a sense, a vast laboratory<br />\nit's important to keep this in mind - that there are<br />\npossibilities for increasing one's awareness and enhancing<br />\none's education; so we have tried to relate the campus to<br />\nthe community...What we've tried to do is to work with<br />\npeople in the city.\"<br />\nThe programs that Wickwire has initiated at<br />\nHopkins have certainly opened the campus to the<br />\nneighborhood, but more importantly, Wickwire feels, it<br />\nhas provided Hopkins students the opportunity to open<br />\ntheir eyes to the community. - The two programs for<br />\nwhich the Chaplain's Office is well noted in terms of<br />\ntheir community involvement are the Tutoring Program.<br />\nfor inner city youths and the Free University for adult<br />\neducation.<br />\n<br />\nMost people inside and outside of Hopkins have<br />\nbeen supportive of these efforts. Chris Colombo commented that the Chaplain's Office has been committed<br />\nto the Homewood community in a positive way for<br />\nyears. He says of Wickwire, \"He tries to enlighten the<br />\nstudent body and the Homewood community, and to<br />\nget people involved both politically and socially.\"<br />\nJohn Roemer said that many times Wickwire has<br />\nseemed to be Hopkins' only connection with the city<br />\nand its social justice concerns. Roemer said that despite<br />\nthe fact that Hopkins is often perceived as an elitist<br />\ninstitution, it is clear that Wickwire has \"enormous<br />\nrespect\" from black civil rights and clergy leaders in the<br />\ncity.<br />\nDr. Francis Rourke spoke of Wickwire's impressive range of activities, stressing his tenacity in pursuing<br />\nhis objectives and adding that Wickwire is one of the few<br />\nwhite persons who is accepted in the black community.<br />\nSome of the programs for which the Chaplain's<br />\nOffice is well noted in this area of community involvement are the Tutoring Program for inner-city children<br />\nand the Free University for adult education. When<br />\nasked about these programs, Wickwire commented,<br />\n\"Well, I think that they are worthwhile. I think the<br />\nTutoring Program is very significant. We've been doing<br />\ntutoring since the 1950's; and yes, I would say the<br />\nprograms are worthwhile \u2022 for a/number of reasons. It's<br />\nnot only true that we help the kids, we do something for<br />\nthem in terms of performance and in attitude, selfimage, daily relationships to teachers in their own<br />\nschools, and in their attitude toward what they're about.<br />\nOn the other hand, I think that the Tutoring Program is<br />\nextremely important for our students here at Homewood and other volunteers because many people in this<br />\ninstitution have not had an opportunity to be in contact<br />\nwith this'part of our society on the other side of North<br />\nAvenue and this can give them insights into what the life<br />\nis like for those people, what some of the problems are,<br />\nso it's very possible that there's a certain sense in which<br />\nwe do more for our own students in terms of their<br />\nlearning from these kids in their situation than maybe<br />\nwe do for anybody else; and I think that as far as our<br />\nstudents are concerned, it is an opportunity to assume<br />\nresponsibility, to develop within themselves, to let<br />\nsomebody else know the); care. It's very important.<br />\nAlso, it's possible that when they leave .here they're<br />\ngoing to vote differently because of this kind of..experience that took them away from campus and gave them<br />\nsome new insights into what life is like.\"<br />\nIn this area, as well, Wickwire has received much<br />\npraise and support. Dr. Rourke called the Tutoring<br />\n--Program an invaluable experience for students and tutees<br />\nalike. Chris Colombo noted that the Chaplain's Office'<br />\noften does programming that the Office of Student<br />\n'Services would be unable to do.<br />\nS1-11 TAR OR RELIGIOUS?<br />\n<br />\nihrioriliorix.._<br />\n.<br />\n0,<br />\nq.<br />\nt ..,<br />\n,...,..<br />\n\"\"\u2022-\u2022\u2022\u2022,..,.,...\u201e--..... -.sp..<br />\n...Air.Av.... - - ,. \u2022<br />\n.......40-r - \u2022-.......-- \u2014<br />\n.....<br />\n,.................:-Aiiimitaiiiiiiit...,z- .:... ----..............-- ....-- 7-\u2022-\u2022<br />\nRelaxing after a lesson in the Tutoring Program<br />\n-..,...<br />\n<br />\nHe was responsible for bringing black speakers<br />\nand entertainers to JHU in the '50s and `60s , and the<br />\nTutoring Program for inner-city youths and the Free<br />\nUniversity, which provides adult education, are Wickwire<br />\ncreations.

Dr.<br />\nRobert Hearn agreed, saying that Wickwire is controversial in the sense that people disagree with his programs, but he expressed the thought that controversial<br />\ntopics guarantee constructive criticism.<br />\nThe efforts of the Chaplain's Office have been<br />\ngeared, mainly, towards an openness on campus and a<br />\ncloser relationship between the University and the rest<br />\nof the community. Many have criticized Wickwire's<br />\nspecific efforts to achieve these goals in the past especially in the areas of civil rights and'civil liberties where he<br />\nwas responsible for bringing controversial speakers<br />\nto the campus. Today, though, Wickwire's work in the<br />\nareas of.civil rights and political freedom is generally<br />\nrespected. Few would criticize and, in fact, most praise<br />\nhis programs such as the Free University and the Tutoring Program. These have certainly become an accepted<br />\npart of the work of the Chaplain's Office. His ideals of<br />\nopenness and equality have their place in the Hopkins<br />\ncommunity today.

Unfortunately, some of these are the ones<br />\nthat most concern students.<br />\nCase in point: this year's Student<br />\nCouncil Education Committee does not<br />\nconsist of petty politicos, but of enthusiastic, capable people who have already<br />\ninstituted a student referendum on plusminus grading and an extension - of the<br />\nstudent faculty advising period. This past<br />\nMonday night, however, the Education<br />\nCommittee attempted to tackle an outgrowth of one of the age-old problems at<br />\nJHU, and ran. into an equally old brick<br />\nwall. The outgrowth was that of growing<br />\nstudent discontent over teaching assistants<br />\nwho are unable to speak English. The<br />\nproblem underlying it is the excessively<br />\nhigh premium this University places on<br />\nresearch achievement by its faculty, at the<br />\nexpense of basic teaching and communication skills.<br />\nThe stereotype of the foreign<br />\nmath/sci whiz whose English-speaking<br />\nabilities render him functionally autistic is<br />\na much-exploited joke, but the fact is that<br />\nstudents in<br />\nintroductory<br />\ncourses are<br />\nrunning into TAs who can't communicate.<br />\nDean Hooker himself agrees that the<br /><br />\nsituation is \"scandalous\" (his word), but<br />\nrejects alternatives dutifully submitted<br />\nby the Education Committee. The bottom<br />\nline, he says, is money: the University<br />\ncannot afford to instruct its faculty in the<br />\nrudiments of English, nor will it pay<br />\nprofessors to pick up the teaching load<br />\ncurrently assumed by the TAs. But that's<br />\nokay, Hooker says, because Hopkins<br />\npublicizes the fact that it is not for<br />\neveryone,\" not a place where students<br />\ncome \"for individual attention, but for<br />\ncontact with top-level people.\" The old<br />\ntrickle down theory, in other words.<br />\nHooker is equally blunt about the<br />\nfact that the reason why non-Englishspeaking students are made TAs is that<br />\nthey are the best scholars.<br />\nOne can swallow these justifications<br />\non the graduate level, where contact with<br />\nthe big names is at least as important as<br />\ngood \"instruction,\" but one can only<br />\nregurgitate them on the undergraduate<br />\nlevel. Understanding basic information is<br />\nessential in introductory courses, particularly in math and science, which are already<br />\nforeign languages unto themselves. It's<br />\nhard enough for the math/sci concentrator<br />\nto deal with inarticulate TAs. but it<br />\nbecomes insult added to injury for a<br />\nnon-concentrator fulfilling a requirement.<br />\nThis is an area where change may be<br />\nnext to impossible without loud student<br />\nbelly-aching. The administration has previously buried some amazingly comprehensive Education Committee reports on the<br />\ndistribution of teaching load among professors and junior faculty, and on tenure, to<br />\nname just two hot topics. But we're paying<br />\nthousands of dollars for a top quality<br />\neducation, and it doesn't seem too much to<br />\nask that our teachers speak the language<br />\nat least as well as we do. We'll just have to<br />\nask louder, that's all.<br /><br />\n..1d Production<br />\nJean Preston<br />\nMargaret Lipschutz<br /><br />\nHelene Caloir<br /><br />\nCover by<br />\nDFG<br />\n0<br /><br />\n\u2022<br /><br />\nBourgeois Feminism:<br />\nNew Can Of Worms<br />\nThe actual realization of<br />\nequal rights for women (and I<br />\ndon't mean simply the ratification of the amendment) will<br />\nhave a profound influence on<br />\nsuch diverse topics as the economy, male-female relationships,<br />\nand human life-styles. If the<br />\nwomen's movement is shortsighted in its aims: such as<br />\nstriving only for female independence, the likely result is that<br />\nmale-female relationships will<br />\ngrow touchy, community structure will break down, and all of<br />\nus will find ourselves fallen prey<br />\nto the interests of the rich<br />\nbourgeoisie.

In order to<br />\nsurvive, the woman married, and<br />\nin doing so sacrificed much of<br />\nher freedom (actually, before<br />\nmarriage the woman was controlled by her parents). Ah ha!<br />\nSo now women are able to<br />\nsupport themselves, and many<br />\nare realizing that for them<br />\nmarriage, at least in the minds of<br />\ntheir husbands, means that they<br />\nmust sacrifice careers and social<br />\nlife. For both mean and women<br />\nmarriage often meant isolation<br />\nof the couple from friends.<br />\nThough this often led to stress in<br />\nthe relationship, usually their<br />\nmutual solitude or obligation to<br />\nchildren kept them together<br />\nuntil one or the other died,<br />\nleaving the other totally isolated.<br />\ncont. on p. 5<br />\ned<br /><br />\nI'd like to tell about two<br />\nincidents regarding myself and<br />\ncampus police that occurred last<br />\nyear(my freshman year). About<br />\nthis time last year, my dorm<br />\nroom was broken into by a<br />\nnon-student. Luckily, a maintenance person witnessed the<br />\nevent and dialed campus police.<br />\nOfficers arrived in seconds to<br />\napprehend the criminal.<br />\nDuring the course of the<br />\nyear I was required to appear in<br />\ncourt twice to present evidence<br />\nagainst the defendant (who by<br />\nthe way was convicted and<br />\nsentenced to three years in<br />\nprison). Each of those two days,<br />\na campus police officer assigned<br />\nto my case went out of his way<br />\nto drive me to court and back.<br />\nHe also stayed with me during<br />\nthe proceedings as I was quite<br />\nnervous.<br />\nI want to again express my<br />\nappreciation to the campus<br />\npolice for their quick action the<br />\nmorning of the crime. I would<br />\nalso like to thank the officer for<br /><br />\nhis assistance during the pretrial<br />\nhearing and during the trial.<br />\nAnother incident occurred<br />\nlast year involving a different<br />\nofficer, a friend, and myself. My<br />\nfriend had just switched dorm<br />\nrooms and I was helping him<br />\nmove his belongings. We were<br />\napproached by an officer and<br />\nquestioned for quite a length of<br />\ntime regarding the nature of the<br />\ncontents of the boxes we were<br />\ncarrying, where we were going,<br />\nand from where we came. He<br />\nthen searched the boxes (the<br />\nitems were pots, pans, dishes,<br />\nnonperishable food, etc.), and<br />\nordered us to show him our<br />\nidentification cards. He then<br />\nwrote down our names, dorm<br />\nrooms, and a description of the<br />\npots, pans, dishes, nonperishable<br />\nfood, etc. that we were carrying.<br />\nI understand that there may<br />\nhave been some concern and/or<br />\nsuspicion on his part regarding<br />\nour actions, but I feel that both<br />\nhis lengthy interrogation and his<br />\nsearch through the boxes were<br />\nunnecessary and embarrassing.<br />\nIf we were in the same place,<br />\nsame time, etc., but carrying<br />\ntextbooks and notebooks in-<br /><br />\nstead of pots, pans, dishes,<br />\nnonperishable food, etc., would<br />\nwe have been subjected to a<br />\nsimilar detainment and search?<br />\nDave Breznick<br />\nClass of 1984<br /><br />\nBowl Full O'RedTape.<br />\nEd. note: Just as we were<br />\ntucking ourselves in one night last<br />\nweek, there was a dreadful<br />\nclatter on the roof and the<br />\nfollowing bit of doggerel drifted<br />\ndown into the fireplace.

Once you<br />\ndecide whether to sit in the front row or<br />\nthe back row (your only choices), you<br />\nwill find yourself confronted by about<br />\nthe best serious theater Baltimore has to<br />\noffer. Aside from Center Stage and<br />\nTheater Hopkins, they are the only<br />\ncompany to present regularly a healthy<br />\nselection of the classics. Its most unique<br />\ncharacteristic is its size; seating a bare 50,<br />\nit brings the audience close enough to the<br />\nactors to see them think. This presents<br />\nthe cast with an unusual challenge to<br />\ntheir acting abilities, and one that they<br />\ntake on quite successfully.<br />\nThe Play is a funny thing; Pinter<br />\nshows us that life is absurd as it is painful.<br />\nThe play is a tormented cry from a<br />\nmodern world we can either choose not<br />\nto understand or choose to make sense<br />\nof.<br />\nPinter's method is to present a<br />\nflipped coin. On one side are the followers of the absurd theater who contend<br />\nthat the play should not be limited by<br />\ndramatic classification. Pinter himself<br />\ndislikes dramatic interpretation and rarely<br />\ncomments on the meaning of his works.<br />\nOn the other side are those<br />\npeople who need to fit this play into a<br />\narising out of the<br />\ncategorical scheme<br />\n19th-century drawing-room drama, or<br /><br />\nto giw Marxist interpretations to the petitbourgeois Pinter household.<br />\nBoth sides of the coin are correct.<br />\nThis is why the play is a \"theatrical<br />\nexperience\" different for each individual.<br />\nThe boundaries of interpretation are<br />\nlimited only by each person's capacity to<br />\n\"experience\" the play in his own mind.<br />\nIn short, the audience writes the play.<br />\nTo spite the play's vague structure, the dramatic situation is simple. A<br />\nman and his wife, well-to-do and well<br />\neducated, entertain a female friend,<br />\nwhom 20 years ago was the wife's roommate. From this, the conflict moves back<br />\nand forth in time, unfolding the past lives<br />\nof these people.<br />\nAt one time the roommates had a<br />\nlesbian relationship, and at one time the<br />\nvisiting girlfriend was the husband's lover.<br />\nWhen the past becomes present, their<br />\nrelationships become disturbingly intertwined. When the lesbian relationship<br />\nseems renewed the husband becomes<br />\nthreatened and backs himself into a trap<br />\nfrom which there is no escape.<br />\nIn the end the play becomes the<br />\npower of women to rip at the souls of<br />\ncallous men. A moment is relived where<br />\nthe wife refuses to comply sexually. The<br />\npresent becomes unbearable: the husband<br />\nbreaks down and is forced to turn his<br />\nback, escaping the female world.<br />\nOf course this is only one plausible interpretation constructed out of a<br />\nPinter montage. Old Times provides only<br />\nbits of data. Language is simple and<br />\noften without syntax or coherence.<br /><br />\nPauses are dark and have the power to<br />\nkill. Above all, time is incidental. This<br />\nis the beauty of the play: the audience is<br />\ncalled upon to make meaning out of a<br />\nmysterious world.<br />\nThe Fells Point Theater is an ideal<br />\nenvironment for Old Times, because of its<br />\n'small size. Each member of the audience<br />\ncan be intimately involved in the triangle<br />\nrelationship. In a play with so few lines,<br />\nfacial expressions and subtle eye contact<br />\nbecome major ways of understanding<br />\nthe drama.<br />\nThe performances of Elizabeth<br />\nRyan, King W. White III. and Gloria<br />\nHenderson are well executed. As the play<br />\nprogresses, their relationships become<br />\ntenuously defined. The anxiety building<br />\nbetween the performers is shared by the<br />\naudience. When the lights come on, in<br />\nthe final moments of the play, a dramatic<br />\nghostly truth forces the small audience to<br />\nface each other in the present.<br />\nThis is a memory play in which<br />\nthe memories of the past taint the reality<br />\nof the present. There is no one adequate<br />\nsolution to the mysteries. The more you<br />\ntry to make sense out of the production<br />\nthe more pleasure you get. In an age<br />\nwhen commercial theaters house audiences in the hundreds, the production is<br />\nan unusual opportunity for intimate<br />\ntheatrical collaboration.<br />\nThe Fells Point Theater Production of<br />\nOld Times runs through October 18.

Throughout<br />\nthe 1950s and, especially, the 1960s Wickwire practiced his own brand of activism at Hopkins which earned<br />\nhim a reputation as a controversial figure. He struggled<br />\nfor integration, for civil rights, and civil liberties within<br />\nthe University and outside in the community.<br />\nOver the years, Wickwire's efforts to promote the<br />\ncauses of political freedom and civil rights have often<br />\nbeen unappreciated, to say the least, by Hopkins and<br />\ncommunity people alike in times when such ideals were<br />\nnot generally accepted. Wickwire has been a liberal and<br />\nan activist at what is generally considered a quiet.<br />\nconservative university.<br />\nIn introducing Dr. Wickwire and his achievements at Hopkins, one must consider what some see<br />\nas. his conflicting religious and secular roles. Wickwire<br />\ndisputes, characterizations of his political views as<br />\n\"radical,\" and members of the University administration, faculty, and religious groups comment on his<br />\nperformance as chaplain.<br />\nWickwire's expressed goal as Chaplain at JHU is<br />\nto integrate the campus with the community around it.<br />\n\"There is a temptation for any kind of an institution<br />\nto sort of withdraw, and I think that in. a city like<br />\nBaltimore where you have, in a sense, a vast laboratory<br />\nit's important to keep this in mind - that there are<br />\npossibilities for increasing one's awareness and enhancing<br />\none's education; so we have tried to relate the campus to<br />\nthe community...What we've tried to do is to work with<br />\npeople in the city.\"<br />\nThe programs that Wickwire has initiated at<br />\nHopkins have certainly opened the campus to the<br />\nneighborhood, but more importantly, Wickwire feels, it<br />\nhas provided Hopkins students the opportunity to open<br />\ntheir eyes to the community. - The two programs for<br />\nwhich the Chaplain's Office is well noted in terms of<br />\ntheir community involvement are the Tutoring Program.<br />\nfor inner city youths and the Free University for adult<br />\neducation.<br /><br />\nMost people inside and outside of Hopkins have<br />\nbeen supportive of these efforts. Chris Colombo commented that the Chaplain's Office has been committed<br />\nto the Homewood community in a positive way for<br />\nyears. He says of Wickwire, \"He tries to enlighten the<br />\nstudent body and the Homewood community, and to<br />\nget people involved both politically and socially.\"<br />\nJohn Roemer said that many times Wickwire has<br />\nseemed to be Hopkins' only connection with the city<br />\nand its social justice concerns. Roemer said that despite<br />\nthe fact that Hopkins is often perceived as an elitist<br />\ninstitution, it is clear that Wickwire has \"enormous<br />\nrespect\" from black civil rights and clergy leaders in the<br />\ncity.<br />\nDr. Francis Rourke spoke of Wickwire's impressive range of activities, stressing his tenacity in pursuing<br />\nhis objectives and adding that Wickwire is one of the few<br />\nwhite persons who is accepted in the black community.<br />\nSome of the programs for which the Chaplain's<br />\nOffice is well noted in this area of community involvement are the Tutoring Program for inner-city children<br />\nand the Free University for adult education. When<br />\nasked about these programs, Wickwire commented,<br />\n\"Well, I think that they are worthwhile. I think the<br />\nTutoring Program is very significant. We've been doing<br />\ntutoring since the 1950's; and yes, I would say the<br />\nprograms are worthwhile \u2022 for a/number of reasons. It's<br />\nnot only true that we help the kids, we do something for<br />\nthem in terms of performance and in attitude, selfimage, daily relationships to teachers in their own<br />\nschools, and in their attitude toward what they're about.<br />\nOn the other hand, I think that the Tutoring Program is<br />\nextremely important for our students here at Homewood and other volunteers because many people in this<br />\ninstitution have not had an opportunity to be in contact<br />\nwith this'part of our society on the other side of North<br />\nAvenue and this can give them insights into what the life<br />\nis like for those people, what some of the problems are,<br />\nso it's very possible that there's a certain sense in which<br />\nwe do more for our own students in terms of their<br />\nlearning from these kids in their situation than maybe<br />\nwe do for anybody else; and I think that as far as our<br />\nstudents are concerned, it is an opportunity to assume<br />\nresponsibility, to develop within themselves, to let<br />\nsomebody else know the); care. It's very important.<br />\nAlso, it's possible that when they leave .here they're<br />\ngoing to vote differently because of this kind of..experience that took them away from campus and gave them<br />\nsome new insights into what life is like.\"<br />\nIn this area, as well, Wickwire has received much<br />\npraise and support. Dr. Rourke called the Tutoring<br />\n--Program an invaluable experience for students and tutees<br />\nalike. Chris Colombo noted that the Chaplain's Office'<br />\noften does programming that the Office of Student<br />\n'Services would be unable to do.<br />\nS1-11 TAR OR RELIGIOUS?<br /><br />\nihrioriliorix.._<br />\n.<br />\n0,<br />\nq.<br />\nt ..,<br />\n,...,..<br />\n\"\"\u2022-\u2022\u2022\u2022,..,.,...\u201e--..... -.sp..<br />\n...Air.Av.... - - ,. \u2022<br />\n.......40-r - \u2022-.......-- \u2014<br />\n.....<br />\n,.................:-Aiiimitaiiiiiiit...,z- .:... ----..............-- ....-- 7-\u2022-\u2022<br />\nRelaxing after a lesson in the Tutoring Program<br />\n-..,...<br /><br />\nHe was responsible for bringing black speakers<br />\nand entertainers to JHU in the '50s and `60s , and the<br />\nTutoring Program for inner-city youths and the Free<br />\nUniversity, which provides adult education, are Wickwire<br />\ncreations.

There might be cases on the campus where it commented that Wickwire tries very hard to allow for all<br />\nmight be important to bring in people the represented forms of expression of religious beliefs.<br />\nparticular points of view which are almost never given<br />\nany hearing. My definition, my interpretation of what it<br />\nWickwire has considerable support for this view<br />\nmeans to be involved in religion is in this area of social of his duties.

I think there are other signs too, of<br />\nlife, of concern.\"<br />\nPerhaps Dr. Wickwire has been a controversial<br />\nfigure on campus in the past, but not so anymore.<br />\nChris Colombo commented that Wickwire is not really<br />\ncontroversial but that some of his programs are. Dr.<br />\nRobert Hearn agreed, saying that Wickwire is controversial in the sense that people disagree with his programs, but he expressed the thought that controversial<br />\ntopics guarantee constructive criticism.<br />\nThe efforts of the Chaplain's Office have been<br />\ngeared, mainly, towards an openness on campus and a<br />\ncloser relationship between the University and the rest<br />\nof the community. Many have criticized Wickwire's<br />\nspecific efforts to achieve these goals in the past especially in the areas of civil rights and'civil liberties where he<br />\nwas responsible for bringing controversial speakers<br />\nto the campus. Today, though, Wickwire's work in the<br />\nareas of.civil rights and political freedom is generally<br />\nrespected. Few would criticize and, in fact, most praise<br />\nhis programs such as the Free University and the Tutoring Program. These have certainly become an accepted<br />\npart of the work of the Chaplain's Office. His ideals of<br />\nopenness and equality have their place in the Hopkins<br />\ncommunity today. It appears that after- twenty-eight<br />\nyears of activism, Wickwire's ideas have found acceptance in the general community, both inside and outside<br />\nChester's Place provides young musicians<br />\nof Hopkins.<br />\nthe opportunity to display their talents.<br /><br />\nA C:1.; 14'OCTOBER<br /><br />\n16 19R1<br />\nA<br /><br />\nV<br /><br />\nHey Parents!<br />\nHaving a good time?<br />\nYOU KNOW, EVERY WEEKEND<br />\nCAN BE PARENTS WEEKEND<br />\nWITH THE HOPKINS NEWS LETTER.<br />\nSubscribe now and a little bit of Johns<br />\nor Janes Hopkins will come home for a visit<br />\nevery week.<br />\nAnd it won't be out till all hours with<br />\nfriends either.

It's as if<br />\ntheir lives are temporarily in fast<br />\nforward.

The<br />\nfirst day run about a block and<br />\nthen take the subway or bus<br />\na mile or two. Gradually increase the distance until you're<br />\nrunning about a mile and riding<br />\nabout five miles. Then increase<br />\nboth proportionally and work<br />\non increasing speed.<br />\nS&amp;M: What's the best way for a<br />\nrunner to build up his speed?<br />\nDr. Quackenbush: Well, one<br />\nway is to run in Central Park<br />\naround midnight with a $100<br />\nbill hanging from your back. If<br />\nyou don't want to lose the<br />\nmoney, you'll run fast.<br />\nS&amp;M: Very interesting. Is there<br />\nany skill involved in running?<br />\nDr. Quackenbush: Not really.<br /><br />\nThat's one of the great things<br />\nabout running. There are a<br />\nfew techniques, however. For<br />\ninstance,. if a good-looking person of the opposite sex is<br />\nrunning up ahead, there's skill<br />\ninvolved in keeping the proper<br />\nangle for the best possible view.<br />\nS&amp;M: That mustbe crucial. Dr.<br />\nQuackenbush, what about advice<br />\nfor people training for a marathon?<br />\nDr. Quackenbush: First of all,<br />\nanyone who runs 26 miles is<br />\nmeshugah, so you have to learn<br />\nsome tricks.
