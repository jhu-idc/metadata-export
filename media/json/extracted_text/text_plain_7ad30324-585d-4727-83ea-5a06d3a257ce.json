At<br />\nthe end of the game the score<br />\nstood 2 to 2. An extra period of<br />\n10 minutes was started, and nine<br />\nminutes of this was played to a<br />\nstandsill when Murphy shot the<br />\ndeciding goal in the last minute<br />\nof play. The game was the first<br />\non the schedule for the Army, and,<br />\nas it is their first year at lacrosse,<br />\nthey show wonderful possibilities<br />\nof developing a championship<br />\nteam. They have a big, fighting<br />\nteam, in perfect physical condition, and the men seem to know a<br />\nlot more about the game than<br />\nwould be supposed at thik stage of<br />\nthe season.

The<br />\noriginal plan suggested Saturday<br />\nnight for the banquet but by the<br />\nvote of a large majority it was<br />\nchanged to Monday night. On<br />\nSunday every Senior will attend<br />\nthe bacculaureate service at one<br />\nof the city's best churches and will<br />\nbe in cap and gown if the old tradition is adhered to.

The<br />\noriginal plan suggested Saturday<br />\nnight for the banquet but by the<br />\nvote of a large majority it was<br />\nchanged to Monday night. On<br />\nSunday every Senior will attend<br />\nthe bacculaureate service at one<br />\nof the city's best churches and will<br />\nbe in cap and gown if the old tradition is adhered to.
