C in:illation 7000.<br />\n<br />\nBridging The Gap Demands<br />\nInitiative From The Top<br />\nThe administrators and faculty who make<br />\n\u2022 policy concerning undergraduate education<br />\nlack a clear understanding of student opinion and often exhibit a disregard of student<br />\ninterests. This year's Student Council realizes<br />\nthis and is making an effort to bridge the gap<br />\nbetween students and administrators and<br />\nfaculty with softball games and \"take the<br />\nteacher to lunch week.\" While these efforts<br />\nare commendable, the problem will remain<br />\nuntil the administration and faculty take the<br />\ninitiative to improve relations.<br />\nImportant<br />\npolicies<br />\nregarding<br />\nundergraduate education and student life at<br />\nHopkins are generally formed without student input. From time to time, policy makers<br />\nattempt to gauge student opinion by reading<br />\nTheNews-Letter or consulting Student Council members. Yet these views can be rejected<br />\nor accepted at the discretion of the policy<br />\nmakers. Student groups' lack of power and<br />\ninfluence has been reflected in several recent<br />\nissues. Last year, for instance, the Academic<br />\nCouncil voted to implement plus/minus<br />\ngrading before learning that students were<br />\noverwhelmingly opposed to it. In the spring,<br />\nthe same body allowed professors to give lectures or exams during reading week, again<br />\nignoring student opinion. Even now, as the<br />\nadministration decides how to allocate vacant offices in Levering Hall, the Student<br />\nUnion, undergraduate concerns may not be<br />\nconsidered.<br />\nOne reason that administrators and facul<br />\n<br />\nty offer in defense of student exclusion from<br />\npolicy decisions is that students are transient.<br />\nThey feel that because a different set of<br />\nundergraduates come to Hopkins every four<br />\nyears that student attitudes shift radically<br />\nover long periods of time.<br />\nThe News-Letter believes this to be false.<br />\nWhat concerns students today will likely still<br />\nconcern them ten or twenty years from now,<br />\nbarring any radical change in the type of<br />\nundergraduates Hopkins recruits. The very<br />\nbasic educational, social, economic and<br />\npolitical needs of students do not fluctuate.<br />\nUnfortunately, students have few ways to<br />\nexert pressure on Hopkins policy makers.<br />\nUnless the political process is changed so as<br />\nto guarantee greater student involvement, we<br />\nmust rely on the faculty and administrators<br />\nto increase their consideration of student<br />\nconcerns and attitudes. The News-Letter<br />\nurges important administrators and<br />\nAcademic Council members to take the initiative and actively seek student opinion.<br />\nThe Academic Council should consult the<br />\nCommittee on Undergraduate Studies and<br />\nthe Student Council more frequently, and<br />\nmake a concerted effort to meet with individual students on a regular basis. The Student Council is on the right track when it<br />\norganize events to foster closer ties between<br />\nthe students and those who decide their fate.<br />\nYet progress will probably be minimal until<br />\nthe faculty and administration themselves<br />\ndevelop a new attitude and start to really<br />\nlisten to the students.<br />\n<br />\nLetters<br />\nStudent Council Descends To Tamany Hall Practices<br />\nTo the Editor:<br />\nOn April 13, 1982 the election for Class officers and reps<br />\nfor Classes of '83,'84, and '85<br />\nwere held, as always, under the<br />\nprovisions of the Elections<br />\nCommission Constitution.<br />\nA new rule was introduced<br />\nsuddenly \"after the votes were<br />\ncounted,\" without anyone<br />\nbothering either before the elections or for several months<br />\nafter to go through the formality of changing the constitution.<br />\nIndeed, this rule was not announced in any form, to the<br />\ncandidates or anyone else,<br />\nbefore the election was over.<br />\nThe constitution called for<br />\nelection without run-off of<br />\nReps whose name appeared<br />\n\"on the majority of the<br />\nballots.\" In one race for my<br />\nclass ('83) Grant Lally was<br />\nvoted for on 69 of 133 ballots<br />\n(276 votes cast) and thus was<br />\nelected\u2014according to everyone<br />\nbut the Elections Commission<br />\nchairman, Keith Jones, who<br />\nruled that \"majority of the<br />\nballots\" should be interpreted<br />\naccording to a new formula<br />\n<br />\n(v'h/(1(2 1)sl, with v5votes needed, n' votes cast, and k the<br />\nnumber of seats, for you<br />\nstatistics bugs)and thus Lally's<br />\nelection threshhold was 70.<br />\nThus, Lally was not elected,<br />\nand as far as Council is con<br />\ncerned, never will be.<br />\nA !notion was passed by<br />\nCouncil at the instance of<br />\nHarry Davis to deny Lally's appeal. An amendment has since<br />\nbeen passed by Council at their<br />\nSept. 15, 1982 meeting which<br />\nretroactively legitimized this<br />\n\"ruling\"(by amending the constitution), but the application<br />\nof this rule \"after the ballots<br />\nhad been counted\", as admitted by Davis, the author of the<br />\nsuccessful motion before Council at the May 5th meeting to<br />\n\"accept the results of the elections as announced\" and thus<br />\nto close the only avenue of appeal regarding the practices of<br />\nthe Elections Committee, is in<br />\nmy view of things a travesty.<br />\nThe Council endorsed the application of a September<br />\namendment to an April election<br />\nissue raised in May! Either that<br />\nor Keith Jones somehow<br />\n<br />\nmanaged to convince himself<br />\nthat the formula (a quarterplus-one of the votes) can be<br />\nderived from the constitutional<br />\nprovision that the runoff shall<br />\nbe held from among those not<br />\nnamed on \"the majority of the<br />\nballots cast.\"<br />\nIt is this writer's contention<br />\nthat Council's decision was<br />\nblatantly political, in light of<br />\nthe fact, among others, that the<br />\nsame Grant Lally whose petition was rejected had less than<br />\na month earlier lost a runoff<br />\nelection for S.C. Treasurer to<br />\nnone other than Harry Davis,<br />\nproponent of the \"gag rule.\"<br />\nTuesday, Sept. 28 there will<br />\nbe a referendum to seat Lally.<br />\nOne of the Council Reps from<br />\n'83 is resigning, and Council<br />\nwants to fill the vacancy by appointment. Please vote to let<br />\nLally take the seat.

(Don't worry\u2014<br />\nwe're just as wise to the ways<br />\nof the world as the rest of you.)<br />\nThe decision was left entirely up<br />\nto the senior class officers. In<br />\naddition, the reporter did not<br />\nexamine the key issue of the<br />\nmatter, which is he consequences of showing such a<br />\nmovie and why the decision to<br />\ndo so should not have been<br />\nmade independently by the film<br />\nseries chair people. It does not<br />\nseem too difficult to understand<br />\nwhy such a film has the potential to cause enormous problems; and for anyone to ignore<br />\nthis is foolishness. We are not<br />\ntalking about rights.<br />\nWe do not live in a vacuum;<br />\nand those who favor showing<br />\nthis film seem to conveniently<br />\nignore that fact. First of all, the<br />\nfilm series is part of the senior<br />\nclass, which is only a small part<br />\nof the entire university, which<br />\nis an important part of an entire community. Each group<br />\nhas a certain obligation to the<br />\nothers to behave responsibly,<br />\nand the decision of two individuals to shirk that responsibility without any consideration of its effects beyond the<br />\npremise that another X rated<br />\nmovie was shown last year and<br />\nthat \"This will be a big<br />\nmoneymaker\" is absolutely<br />\nabsurd.<br />\nThere are important reasons<br />\nfor not wanting to show \"Deep<br />\nThroat.\" But more important<br />\nat this point is for everyone to<br />\nunderstand the impropriety of<br />\nthe chain of events that has occured in relation to this movie.<br />\nMoral considerations aside,<br />\n(how anyone around here<br />\nchooses to get their thrills is<br />\ntheir own business) the point is<br />\nthat the selection and planned<br />\nshowing of this movie, without<br />\nany advice or consent from<br />\n<br />\nthose who may be offended,<br />\nwas not a judicious decision.<br />\nThe University does not currently have a film policy; supposedly on the premise that<br />\nthose who show films have<br />\nenough discretion and common<br />\nsense to weigh the potential<br />\nmerits and drawbacks of any<br />\nfilm they plan to show. An<br />\nevent like this may change that,<br />\nwhich will bring all films under<br />\nthe scrutiny of a limited and<br />\nstructured set of rules.<br />\nFreedom of speech is one<br />\nthing, but inconsiderate and offensive actions are something<br />\nthat I would like no part of.<br />\nVery truly yours,<br />\nStephanie Kretchmer<br />\nVice-President.

Of all the proposals<br />\nsubmitted, Johns Hopkins was<br />\nthe one chosen.<br />\nThe building that will house<br />\nthe Space Telescope Institute is<br />\nlocated on San Martin Drive. 11<br />\nwill be occupied in April.<br />\nJohns Hopkins owns the<br />\nbuilding, and will rent it to the<br />\ngovernment. The scientific staff<br />\nof the Institute will be a sort of<br />\n\"extended faculty\", with opportunities for adjunct and full<br />\njoint appointments to the<br />\nphysics<br />\ndepartment<br />\nat<br />\nHomewood. Like faculty, they<br />\nwill have access to all benefits<br />\nof the University such as the<br />\nlibrary and the athletic center.<br />\nThey will have their own<br />\n<br />\ngraduate students, enrolled at<br />\nHomewood, who will also be<br />\nhired as research and data<br />\nassistants. Presently, the staff<br />\nof the Institute numbers fifty,<br />\ntwenty of whom are scientific<br />\nstaff.<br />\n<br />\naway than can now be seen with<br />\nground-based telescopes. It' the<br />\n<br />\ntwo percent of its present age.<br />\nThe instruments aboatd the<br />\n<br />\nassistance of the Space Shuttle.<br />\nEvers' four or five years a crew<br />\n<br />\nFacilities in the building will<br />\ninclude a library, an<br />\nauditorium,<br />\noffices,<br />\nlaboratories, instruments to<br />\ncollect data, an archive for the<br />\ndata, and instruments to position the telescope. The building<br />\nwill also house a computer with<br />\nterminals, but will not be accessible to the students.<br />\nThe telescope itself will be<br />\nlaunched in February of 1985.<br />\nAt that time the staff of the Institute will have grown to 200,<br />\nfirty of whom will be part of<br />\nthe scientific staff. The<br />\ntelescope will be approximately 300 miles above the earth,<br />\nwell out of the atmosphere.<br />\nThe fact that there will be no<br />\natmospheric obstruction makes<br />\nthe Space Telescope a major<br />\nadvance for scientific observation. Researchers will be able to<br />\nview objects which are dozens<br />\nof times fainter and further<br />\n<br />\nScience<br />\n<br />\nJo,<br />\n<br />\nproponents of the Big Bang<br />\ntheory of the origin of the<br />\nuniverse are correct, it may be<br />\npossible to collect massive<br />\namounts of data about the<br />\nbeginning of the universe.<br />\nScientists thus may be able to,<br />\nin effect, look back to a time<br />\nwhen the Universe was one or<br />\n<br />\ntelescope include a computer,<br />\na high-speed photometer, inmeasure<br />\nstruments<br />\nto<br />\nultraviolet light, and instruments to measure the position of stars.<br />\nTo repair the Space<br />\nTelescope<br />\nrequires<br />\nthe<br />\n<br />\nof astronauts will board the<br />\nshuttle and pay a visit to the<br />\ntelescope. Repairs and replacement of entire modules will be<br />\neffected. The astronauts will<br />\ntake the telescope further from<br />\nEarth, to prevent it from one<br />\nday crashing down as did<br />\nSkylab.<br />\n<br />\n\fRestaurant Review<br />\n<br />\nFeast Awaits in The Rotunda<br />\nBY CHARLES KRUZANSKV<br />\nThe most important thing about the new<br />\n\"Smorgasbord\" in the Rotunda just north of<br />\ncampus is that it is nothing like the Horn and<br />\nHorn cafeteria that was there for years. Don't<br />\nlet any of those bad memories or disgusting<br />\nstories prevent you from going to this innovative<br />\neating place.. The name that is used,<br />\n\"Smorgasbord,\" is appropriate if only because<br />\nit cannot be called a restaurant or cafeteria. The<br />\nformat is all-you-can-eat, but not just of one<br />\nFood or one special of the day, as was the case<br />\nin the old cafeteria. \"The Smorgasbord\" is allyou-can-eat of everything in a self-serve fashion.<br />\nThe food is laid out in a long row that can be<br />\napproached from either side. There are always<br />\nseven main dishes, bread, soup, hot and cold<br />\ndrinks, and several desserts including vanilla and<br />\nchocoiate ice cream and toppings.<br />\nThe main dish area is always the first to be hit.<br />\nAmong the main dishes available at a recent visit<br />\nwere veal parmigiana, lasagna, fish cakes,<br />\nmacaroni and cheese, and fried chicken.<br />\nThe good variety of cooked and fresh<br />\nvegetables are always plentiful. The desserts consist of apple, peach, and blueberry with cake<br />\ncombinations including some type of chocolate<br />\ncake,_ There _is soda, coffee, tea, milk, and an<br />\nassortment of fruit drinks.<br />\nFor the strategist who knows what he wants<br />\nout of an all-you-can-eat establishment, the<br />\n\"Smorgasbord\" is the ultimate challenge. It is<br />\nvery possible to get a very good meal there for<br />\n<br />\na very low price. Lunch, served every weekday<br />\nfrom 11:00 a.m. to 2:30 p.m. costs only $3.47<br />\nwhile dinner, served 4:00 to 8:00 p.m. weekdays<br />\nand all day Saturday and Sunday, is an<br />\neconomical $4.95.<br />\nThe main courses are the focal point of any<br />\nassault. They must be sampled and then the best<br />\nones should be attacked at a moderate, constant<br />\npace. Salads, breads, soups and vegetables<br />\nshould be consumed in small portions to prevent<br />\npremature fullness.<br />\nThe desserts are situated between the patron<br />\nand the main dishes, undoubtedly to tempt the<br />\nweaker and less skilled devourers into making a<br />\nsneak attack before the substantive foods have<br />\nbeen blitzed. These eye-pleasing and tasty<br />\ndesserts are quite good. Nevertheless, they should<br />\nnot be attacked before the main foods have been<br />\nthoroughly bombarded, nor can they be<br />\nassaulted on a full stomach. Careful deliberate<br />\ndecisions are the key to optimizing effectivenes3<br />\nat the \"Smorgasbord.\"<br />\nThe relaxed, quiet, unrushed atmosphere is<br />\nconducive to tactical planning. The place is very<br />\ncomfortable in this respect. Even the haphazard,<br />\nlight eater has a good time there, it seems. The<br />\nfood is wholesome, but not at all gourmet.<br />\nIf you enjoy relaxed, unlimited, inexpensive<br />\neating, then the Horn and Horn \"Smorgasbord\"<br />\nis the place for you to mark on your maps as the<br />\nnext target. Bring your heaviest artillery because<br />\nthe food keeps coming, and the variety makes<br />\nit difficult to anticipate the best courses of action.<br />\n<br />\neatures<br />\nAmillftt<br />\n\\<br />\n<br />\nHam on Wn,<br />\n<br />\nPeople Who've Beaten Me Up<br />\nBY MIKE KUN<br />\nMy nose has been broken 28 times. I swear<br />\nthat I'm not making that up-28 times. An xray of my nasal area looks kind of like a jigsaw<br />\npuzzle, although my doctor says it reminds him<br />\nof Hiroshima. You see, I used to get into a lot<br />\nof fights. My dad says it was because I was a<br />\nwise-ass. My mom said it was because all of the<br />\nother kids were jealous of me. My mom is a really nice lady. I like her.<br />\nThe following is a partial list of people who<br />\nhave done physical damage to me(most of these<br />\nencounters resulted in me having to cot:<br />\nton balls stuck up my nostrils for an extended<br />\nperiod of time):<br />\n1. Jeff Hill<br />\nJeff was a good friend of mine in grade school,<br />\nbut he was terminally hyperactive. We used to<br />\nsit next to each other in Mrs. Converse's social<br />\nstudies course, and when Mrs. Converse would<br />\nleave the room to readjust her slip, Jeff would<br />\nbelt me over the head with his binder. The one<br />\npleasure which I took in Jeff's hyperactivity was<br />\nthat he always managed to hurt himself. Once,<br />\nin the third grade, he broke his arm on a field<br />\ntrip to Newport, R.I.. He slept over at my house<br />\nlater that week, and when I wouldn't let him eat<br />\nmy new Avengers comic book, he bashed me in<br />\nthe face with his cast. I stopped breathing for<br />\nabout a week.<br />\n2. Tom Barry<br />\nTom was a neighbor in Rhode Island. We<br />\nstopped being friends when he drew a moustache<br />\non my Tom Seaver baseball card. Well, I got<br />\nreally angry and put his best frog under the tire<br />\nof his mom's car. When he found out, he came<br />\n<br />\nover to my house and gave me a really bad Indian rub on my right wrist and tried to shove my<br />\nturtle in my mouth. Then, he put dog manure<br />\nin my Red Sox batting helmet, but I didn't find<br />\nout about that until later.<br />\n3. Mr. Barry<br />\nMr. Barry was Tom's dad, and he had a really disgusting scar on his face which resembled<br />\nLake Champlain. He was really mad because he<br />\nhad bought that frog for Tom (I thought<br />\neveryone got their frogs over at Dubner's Pond).<br />\nThen he had the nerve to accuse me of setting<br />\nfire to their dog Pepper with my magnifying glass<br />\n(which I did but wasn't about to admit).<br />\nAnyhow, he chased me around for a while on<br />\nhis riding lawnmower before he rubbed my face<br />\nagainst his stucco house.<br />\n4. Todd Foxx<br />\nI called Todd a queer because,he was staring<br />\nat everyone in the shower after gym, and he took<br />\nit personally. He followed me home from school<br />\non his moped and broke my arm with his.<br />\nbaseball bat. Then I punched him in the mouth<br />\nand broke his jaw which was a really stupid thing<br />\nto do since it just made him angrier and he broke<br />\nmy nose. It was even stupider since Mr. Foxx was<br />\nmy soccer coach and made me sit on the bench<br />\nall season.<br />\n5. Doody Gumpis<br />\nDoody had the gall to tell me that Nancy<br />\nO'Hare, my junior high dream girl, had a<br />\ngoldfish-shaped mole on her left breast. Attempting to defend her honor, I got my ribs beat up,<br />\npretty good. Even worse, Doody ended up taking Nancy to the graduation dance, and, while<br />\ndoing the Latin hustle, he ripped off her dress<br />\nto reveal the mole. It was shaped more.like a<br />\n<br />\nwide-mouth bass than a goldfish, though.<br />\n6. The Ridgewood Braves basketball team<br />\nSometimes I get pretty excited when I'm in a<br />\nclose game. Sometimes I go a bit overboard.<br />\nAnyhow, this time we were up by four points<br />\nwith a minute to go, so they fouled me just to<br />\nstop the clock. Their center grabbed me around<br />\nthe neck and threw me down. So, I jumped up<br />\nand yelled, \"C'mon, I'll take you all on.\" They<br />\naccepted.<br />\n7. Scott Hilmer<br />\nI told everyone that I went out with Scott's<br />\nsister when I really didn't. She was so embarassed that she made her whole family move to<br />\nanother state. Scott got mad because he wanted<br />\nto stay.<br />\n8. Debbie Kastern<br />\nI would really rather not talk about this one,<br />\nokay?<br />\n9. Mr. Carlson<br />\nMr. Carlson was my homeroom teacher in<br />\nfifth grade. I once ran into him at a drugstore<br />\non a day when I had stayed home even though<br />\nI was supposed to give an oral report on the<br />\nhistory of Dutch housing. He said that he was<br />\nglad to see that I was feeling better. Then he ran<br />\ninto me with his car.<br />\n10. Mrs. Hallowell<br />\nMrs. Hallowell was our next door neighbor in<br />\nWalnut Creek, California. She got very upset<br />\nwhen I spit in the sterno during her Labor Day<br />\nparty and all the Swedish meatballs got cold. She<br />\nhit me over the head with some Corningware.<br />\n11. Two big guys who must be in a frat<br />\nI tried to give them beer from the \"waste<br />\nbucket\" at a college party. I learned that this was<br />\na mistake.<br />\n<br />\n\fThe Childhood of Charle8Village<br />\nBY NORMA PEREZ<br />\nThe Charles Village which was once considered afigment of Grace Darin's imagination<br />\nhas so firmly rooted its identity as an intellectual enclave in Baltimore, that many are unaware<br />\nthat it was born just fifteen years ago.<br />\nA good deal of the driving force behind<br />\nPeabody Heights' transition into Charles Village<br />\nin 1967 came from the fabrications of Grace<br />\nDarin, a villager dissatisfied with her area's lack<br />\nof identity and with its confusion over the<br />\nPeabody Conservatory area.<br />\nGrace Darin has resided in the Village since<br />\nthe late 1940's and was, at the time, a reporter<br />\nfor The Baltimore Sun. She convinced real estate<br />\ndealers that it would be profitable to plant promotions in their columns for a new center of intellectual creativity called Charles Village. Darin<br />\ndescribed the yet-to-be Charles Village in a manner alluring to the youth of the 60's. When Darin<br />\nwas asked by the elderly of the village why she<br />\npersisted in introducing such tomfoolery notions<br />\nin their, quiet, troublefree community, she<br />\nreplied, \"We have peace now, but it the peace<br />\nof the graveyard.\"<br />\nCharles Village became Darin's pet hobby. It<br />\nbegan as an indulgence which she planned to pursue for at least three years\u2014time enough for any<br />\nsubstantial changes in the scheme of the Village<br />\nto become evident. The result was ten years of<br />\ndedicated expenditure of energy and money. For<br />\nexample, Darin initiated, as well as financially<br />\n<br />\nl'he Margaret Brent School.<br />\n<br />\nsponsored, a newsletter which still circulates, as<br />\none promotional device. She recalls feeling<br />\nstrange when she saw one of her articles about<br />\nCharles Village make the cover of Sun Magazine<br />\nwithout having devised its appearance. Her<br />\nmemories of reading this publication resemble<br />\nthose of a mother witnessing the newborn she<br />\nhad carried for so long. Enthusiam for Grace<br />\nDarin's child, Charles Village, spread like<br />\nwildfire.<br />\nAs Darin had hoped, the young generation arrived in the village and caused a type of<br />\nintellectual revolution. Young parents brought<br />\nconcern for a better educational system.<br />\nThe Barkely-Brent Education Association was<br />\nformed to improve Barkely and Margaret Brent,<br />\nthe two best grammar schools in the Village.<br />\n<br />\nPhotos by Richard Hara<br />\n<br />\nMany designers were hired, and various grants<br />\nwere received Tor a creative playground project.<br />\nStan Edmeister, a sculptor and psychiatrist in<br />\nresidency at Hopkins, analyzed the psychological<br />\nmotivations of children at play there. Fellowships<br />\nwere arranged for teachers from these two<br />\nschools to enroll in summer courses. Streets for<br />\nPeople, an organization Grace Darin refers to<br />\nas the \"town guerilla group\" waged the battle<br />\nto ease parking restrictions on St. Paul and<br />\nMaryland streets. Neighborhood House Tours<br />\nwere established to encourage and display<br />\nrenovations. The Civic Association held a<br />\nfleamarket for several years.<br />\nOne of the most successful ventures in fundraising was the Charles Village Cookbook. It<br />\nwas of a homemade, typed format that became<br />\nso popular that additional printings were required. The motivation behind the cookbook was<br />\nto tap into varied groups of people, cutting<br />\nacross generational lines: everyone knows that<br />\ntheir grandmothers make the best oatmeal, that<br />\nmen are natural-born barbecuers and chefs, and<br />\neven kids discover unique goodies by experimental combinations. Cookbook dinners were held<br />\nfor people to bring dishes they had attempted.<br />\nTen years later, a second edition containing Indian, Chinese, and international recipes missing<br />\nfrom the first volume was printed. These additions indicated that Charles Village had attracted<br />\nmany students from abroad. Elderly people participated in the bustling culture of Charles Village<br />\nby writing journals of their pasts.<br />\nPeople living in Charles Village generally<br />\nrelished the village's innovative character,<br />\nregardless of their initial motivations for coming.

One<br />\nvarsity lacrosse. However, four Eagel<br />\ncoach<br />\ndescribed<br />\nyears ago a man came to Johns Stromberg as \"a very talented<br />\nKid with good hands who runs<br />\nroutes very well. He may not be<br />\nthe fastest guy (4.6 seconds in<br />\nthe 40 yard dash), but he has<br />\ngood technique and fundamentals.\" Even Eagle head coach<br />\nDick<br />\nVermeil<br />\npraised<br />\nStromberg when he said, \"this<br />\nguy can play in this league.\"<br />\nWhile Stromberg was impressing the Philadelphia<br />\ncoaching staff with his ability<br />\nand intelligence, Hopkins football fans kept a watchful eye on<br />\nthe PhiIly roster cuts. For<br />\nseveral weeks Stromberg's<br />\nname remained off the list, and<br />\nBlue Jay followers wondered<br />\n<br />\nwhether a Division 111 all-Star<br />\ncould really qualify \u2022for an<br />\nN.F.L. squad. The 'maybes'<br />\nturned to \"probablies\" as the<br />\nweeks passed, but when<br />\nStromberg pulled his hamstring<br />\nonly two weeks before the<br />\nopening preseason game, the<br />\nskeptics resurfaced. According<br />\nto some Philly coaches,<br />\nStromberg \"fell behind because<br />\nof the injury, and was not able<br />\nto really show his ability.\"<br />\nHowever, Philadelphia did<br />\nnot give up on the injured<br />\nreceiver. Stromberg returned<br />\nfor the second preseason game<br />\nand caught three passes.<br />\nAlthough he \"looked good\",<br />\nStromberg never overcame the<br />\ninjury and was released a few<br />\n<br />\nbelieve that the leg problem was<br />\nthe main reason for the<br />\ndecision.<br />\nTherefore, when<br />\nThe<br />\nNewsletter spoke to Stromberg,<br />\nhe seemed dissappointed, but<br />\nnot distraught. He believes that<br />\nhe is \"a better receiver than<br />\nsome of the ones on the team.\"<br />\nMore \u2022 importantly, he optimistically emphasized that he<br />\nwants to give pro football his<br />\n\"best shot\" and<br />\nthe<br />\nPhiladelphia experience die not<br />\nfullfill these expectations. To<br />\nacheive his goal, Stromberg last<br />\nweek signed a contract with the<br />\nUnited States Football League's<br />\nPhiladelphia Stars.<br />\nIn January, Bill Stromberg<br />\nwill suit up for his new team,<br />\nand by May he might well be<br />\ndays later. Many Eagle officials catching footballs on profesincluding Coach Vermeil, sional fields as he did at<br />\nHopkins head coach Jerry Homewood Field. Throughout<br />\nPfiefer and Stromber himself his career at Hopkins<br />\n<br />\nStromberg teamed with another<br />\ngraduated senior, quarterback<br />\nJim Margraff, to set many offensive records. As previously<br />\nnoted, Stromberg leads Division II and III in career receptions falling only two short ot<br />\nthe Division I record. Additionally, he is ranked third,<br />\n<br />\nbehind two quarterbacks, for<br />\ntotal -offense in Blue Jay<br />\nhistory. Finally, he has the<br />\nlongest reception, 97 yards, and<br />\nmost touchdowns by a Hopkins<br />\nplayer. Blue Jay coach Jerry<br />\nPfiefer, who came to Hopkins<br />\nwith Stromberg and Margreff,<br />\nsaid,\"We are going to miss<br />\nthem, not only their physical<br />\nabilities, but also their leadership qualities.\" He added<br />\nphilosophically, while describ<br />\ning this year's squad without his<br />\n, stars, that \"every year is an adjustment period.\" Similarly<br />\nBill Stromberg must adjust to<br />\npro football and show major<br />\nfootball fans what Blue Jav<br />\nsupporters saw for four years.<br />\n<br />\nHopkins University with similar<br />\nbut additional goals; Bill<br />\nStromberg wanted to become<br />\nthe best receiver in Hopkins<br />\nhistory.<br />\nStromberg not only became<br />\nthe best at Hopkins, his 259<br />\ncareer receptions make him the<br />\nall-time leading pass catcher in<br />\nNCAA Division II and III football history. In addition to<br />\nleading the Blue Jays to an impressive 7-2 1981 campaign, in<br />\nwhich he had 78 receptions, he<br />\nmaintained a high grade point<br />\naverage, earning him several<br />\nlob offers from major corporations. These offers, however,<br />\nhave taken a back seat to this<br />\nlwo-time All American's desire<br />\n<br />\n* *<br />\n<br />\nBlue Jays Lose Opener, Face Widener Tonight<br />\nBY CHRISTOPHER<br />\nMENGLER<br />\n<br />\nteam had penetrated their opponents' 25-yard line.

A few key players to watch<br />\nin tonight's game: the<br />\nbackfield is looking good, and<br />\nthey have a good running attack to the outside.

The kicking game and<br />\nspecial' teams are superb this<br />\nyear. The fine punting of John<br />\nFlynn and place kicking of<br />\n<br />\nJohn O'Melia have strengthened the Jay kicking attack. The<br />\nonly positions when the Blue<br />\nJays showed a weakness is the<br />\nsecondary,<br />\n\u2018especially at the<br />\n<br />\nsafety spots, mostly due to the<br />\nloss of Kama!

This year's Student Council realizes<br />\nthis and is making an effort to bridge the gap<br />\nbetween students and administrators and<br />\nfaculty with softball games and \"take the<br />\nteacher to lunch week.\" While these efforts<br />\nare commendable, the problem will remain<br />\nuntil the administration and faculty take the<br />\ninitiative to improve relations.<br />\nImportant<br />\npolicies<br />\nregarding<br />\nundergraduate education and student life at<br />\nHopkins are generally formed without student input. From time to time, policy makers<br />\nattempt to gauge student opinion by reading<br />\nTheNews-Letter or consulting Student Council members. Yet these views can be rejected<br />\nor accepted at the discretion of the policy<br />\nmakers. Student groups' lack of power and<br />\ninfluence has been reflected in several recent<br />\nissues. Last year, for instance, the Academic<br />\nCouncil voted to implement plus/minus<br />\ngrading before learning that students were<br />\noverwhelmingly opposed to it. In the spring,<br />\nthe same body allowed professors to give lectures or exams during reading week, again<br />\nignoring student opinion. Even now, as the<br />\nadministration decides how to allocate vacant offices in Levering Hall, the Student<br />\nUnion, undergraduate concerns may not be<br />\nconsidered.<br />\nOne reason that administrators and facul<br /><br />\nty offer in defense of student exclusion from<br />\npolicy decisions is that students are transient.<br />\nThey feel that because a different set of<br />\nundergraduates come to Hopkins every four<br />\nyears that student attitudes shift radically<br />\nover long periods of time.<br />\nThe News-Letter believes this to be false.<br />\nWhat concerns students today will likely still<br />\nconcern them ten or twenty years from now,<br />\nbarring any radical change in the type of<br />\nundergraduates Hopkins recruits. The very<br />\nbasic educational, social, economic and<br />\npolitical needs of students do not fluctuate.<br />\nUnfortunately, students have few ways to<br />\nexert pressure on Hopkins policy makers.<br />\nUnless the political process is changed so as<br />\nto guarantee greater student involvement, we<br />\nmust rely on the faculty and administrators<br />\nto increase their consideration of student<br />\nconcerns and attitudes. The News-Letter<br />\nurges important administrators and<br />\nAcademic Council members to take the initiative and actively seek student opinion.<br />\nThe Academic Council should consult the<br />\nCommittee on Undergraduate Studies and<br />\nthe Student Council more frequently, and<br />\nmake a concerted effort to meet with individual students on a regular basis. The Student Council is on the right track when it<br />\norganize events to foster closer ties between<br />\nthe students and those who decide their fate.<br />\nYet progress will probably be minimal until<br />\nthe faculty and administration themselves<br />\ndevelop a new attitude and start to really<br />\nlisten to the students.<br /><br />\nLetters<br />\nStudent Council Descends To Tamany Hall Practices<br />\nTo the Editor:<br />\nOn April 13, 1982 the election for Class officers and reps<br />\nfor Classes of '83,'84, and '85<br />\nwere held, as always, under the<br />\nprovisions of the Elections<br />\nCommission Constitution.<br />\nA new rule was introduced<br />\nsuddenly \"after the votes were<br />\ncounted,\" without anyone<br />\nbothering either before the elections or for several months<br />\nafter to go through the formality of changing the constitution.<br />\nIndeed, this rule was not announced in any form, to the<br />\ncandidates or anyone else,<br />\nbefore the election was over.<br />\nThe constitution called for<br />\nelection without run-off of<br />\nReps whose name appeared<br />\n\"on the majority of the<br />\nballots.\" In one race for my<br />\nclass ('83) Grant Lally was<br />\nvoted for on 69 of 133 ballots<br />\n(276 votes cast) and thus was<br />\nelected\u2014according to everyone<br />\nbut the Elections Commission<br />\nchairman, Keith Jones, who<br />\nruled that \"majority of the<br />\nballots\" should be interpreted<br />\naccording to a new formula<br /><br />\n(v'h/(1(2 1)sl, with v5votes needed, n' votes cast, and k the<br />\nnumber of seats, for you<br />\nstatistics bugs)and thus Lally's<br />\nelection threshhold was 70.<br />\nThus, Lally was not elected,<br />\nand as far as Council is con<br />\ncerned, never will be.<br />\nA !notion was passed by<br />\nCouncil at the instance of<br />\nHarry Davis to deny Lally's appeal. An amendment has since<br />\nbeen passed by Council at their<br />\nSept. 15, 1982 meeting which<br />\nretroactively legitimized this<br />\n\"ruling\"(by amending the constitution), but the application<br />\nof this rule \"after the ballots<br />\nhad been counted\", as admitted by Davis, the author of the<br />\nsuccessful motion before Council at the May 5th meeting to<br />\n\"accept the results of the elections as announced\" and thus<br />\nto close the only avenue of appeal regarding the practices of<br />\nthe Elections Committee, is in<br />\nmy view of things a travesty.<br />\nThe Council endorsed the application of a September<br />\namendment to an April election<br />\nissue raised in May! Either that<br />\nor Keith Jones somehow<br /><br />\nmanaged to convince himself<br />\nthat the formula (a quarterplus-one of the votes) can be<br />\nderived from the constitutional<br />\nprovision that the runoff shall<br />\nbe held from among those not<br />\nnamed on \"the majority of the<br />\nballots cast.\"<br />\nIt is this writer's contention<br />\nthat Council's decision was<br />\nblatantly political, in light of<br />\nthe fact, among others, that the<br />\nsame Grant Lally whose petition was rejected had less than<br />\na month earlier lost a runoff<br />\nelection for S.C.

(Don't worry\u2014<br />\nwe're just as wise to the ways<br />\nof the world as the rest of you.)<br />\nThe decision was left entirely up<br />\nto the senior class officers. In<br />\naddition, the reporter did not<br />\nexamine the key issue of the<br />\nmatter, which is he consequences of showing such a<br />\nmovie and why the decision to<br />\ndo so should not have been<br />\nmade independently by the film<br />\nseries chair people. It does not<br />\nseem too difficult to understand<br />\nwhy such a film has the potential to cause enormous problems; and for anyone to ignore<br />\nthis is foolishness. We are not<br />\ntalking about rights.<br />\nWe do not live in a vacuum;<br />\nand those who favor showing<br />\nthis film seem to conveniently<br />\nignore that fact. First of all, the<br />\nfilm series is part of the senior<br />\nclass, which is only a small part<br />\nof the entire university, which<br />\nis an important part of an entire community. Each group<br />\nhas a certain obligation to the<br />\nothers to behave responsibly,<br />\nand the decision of two individuals to shirk that responsibility without any consideration of its effects beyond the<br />\npremise that another X rated<br />\nmovie was shown last year and<br />\nthat \"This will be a big<br />\nmoneymaker\" is absolutely<br />\nabsurd.<br />\nThere are important reasons<br />\nfor not wanting to show \"Deep<br />\nThroat.\" But more important<br />\nat this point is for everyone to<br />\nunderstand the impropriety of<br />\nthe chain of events that has occured in relation to this movie.<br />\nMoral considerations aside,<br />\n(how anyone around here<br />\nchooses to get their thrills is<br />\ntheir own business) the point is<br />\nthat the selection and planned<br />\nshowing of this movie, without<br />\nany advice or consent from<br /><br />\nthose who may be offended,<br />\nwas not a judicious decision.<br />\nThe University does not currently have a film policy; supposedly on the premise that<br />\nthose who show films have<br />\nenough discretion and common<br />\nsense to weigh the potential<br />\nmerits and drawbacks of any<br />\nfilm they plan to show. An<br />\nevent like this may change that,<br />\nwhich will bring all films under<br />\nthe scrutiny of a limited and<br />\nstructured set of rules.<br />\nFreedom of speech is one<br />\nthing, but inconsiderate and offensive actions are something<br />\nthat I would like no part of.<br />\nVery truly yours,<br />\nStephanie Kretchmer<br />\nVice-President.

Of all the proposals<br />\nsubmitted, Johns Hopkins was<br />\nthe one chosen.<br />\nThe building that will house<br />\nthe Space Telescope Institute is<br />\nlocated on San Martin Drive. 11<br />\nwill be occupied in April.<br />\nJohns Hopkins owns the<br />\nbuilding, and will rent it to the<br />\ngovernment. The scientific staff<br />\nof the Institute will be a sort of<br />\n\"extended faculty\", with opportunities for adjunct and full<br />\njoint appointments to the<br />\nphysics<br />\ndepartment<br />\nat<br />\nHomewood. Like faculty, they<br />\nwill have access to all benefits<br />\nof the University such as the<br />\nlibrary and the athletic center.<br />\nThey will have their own<br /><br />\ngraduate students, enrolled at<br />\nHomewood, who will also be<br />\nhired as research and data<br />\nassistants. Presently, the staff<br />\nof the Institute numbers fifty,<br />\ntwenty of whom are scientific<br />\nstaff.<br /><br />\naway than can now be seen with<br />\nground-based telescopes. It' the<br /><br />\ntwo percent of its present age.<br />\nThe instruments aboatd the<br /><br />\nassistance of the Space Shuttle.<br />\nEvers' four or five years a crew<br /><br />\nFacilities in the building will<br />\ninclude a library, an<br />\nauditorium,<br />\noffices,<br />\nlaboratories, instruments to<br />\ncollect data, an archive for the<br />\ndata, and instruments to position the telescope. The building<br />\nwill also house a computer with<br />\nterminals, but will not be accessible to the students.<br />\nThe telescope itself will be<br />\nlaunched in February of 1985.<br />\nAt that time the staff of the Institute will have grown to 200,<br />\nfirty of whom will be part of<br />\nthe scientific staff. The<br />\ntelescope will be approximately 300 miles above the earth,<br />\nwell out of the atmosphere.<br />\nThe fact that there will be no<br />\natmospheric obstruction makes<br />\nthe Space Telescope a major<br />\nadvance for scientific observation. Researchers will be able to<br />\nview objects which are dozens<br />\nof times fainter and further<br /><br />\nScience<br /><br />\nJo,<br /><br />\nproponents of the Big Bang<br />\ntheory of the origin of the<br />\nuniverse are correct, it may be<br />\npossible to collect massive<br />\namounts of data about the<br />\nbeginning of the universe.<br />\nScientists thus may be able to,<br />\nin effect, look back to a time<br />\nwhen the Universe was one or<br /><br />\ntelescope include a computer,<br />\na high-speed photometer, inmeasure<br />\nstruments<br />\nto<br />\nultraviolet light, and instruments to measure the position of stars.<br />\nTo repair the Space<br />\nTelescope<br />\nrequires<br />\nthe<br /><br />\nof astronauts will board the<br />\nshuttle and pay a visit to the<br />\ntelescope. Repairs and replacement of entire modules will be<br />\neffected. The astronauts will<br />\ntake the telescope further from<br />\nEarth, to prevent it from one<br />\nday crashing down as did<br />\nSkylab.<br /><br />\nRestaurant Review<br /><br />\nFeast Awaits in The Rotunda<br />\nBY CHARLES KRUZANSKV<br />\nThe most important thing about the new<br />\n\"Smorgasbord\" in the Rotunda just north of<br />\ncampus is that it is nothing like the Horn and<br />\nHorn cafeteria that was there for years. Don't<br />\nlet any of those bad memories or disgusting<br />\nstories prevent you from going to this innovative<br />\neating place.. The name that is used,<br />\n\"Smorgasbord,\" is appropriate if only because<br />\nit cannot be called a restaurant or cafeteria. The<br />\nformat is all-you-can-eat, but not just of one<br />\nFood or one special of the day, as was the case<br />\nin the old cafeteria. \"The Smorgasbord\" is allyou-can-eat of everything in a self-serve fashion.<br />\nThe food is laid out in a long row that can be<br />\napproached from either side. There are always<br />\nseven main dishes, bread, soup, hot and cold<br />\ndrinks, and several desserts including vanilla and<br />\nchocoiate ice cream and toppings.<br />\nThe main dish area is always the first to be hit.<br />\nAmong the main dishes available at a recent visit<br />\nwere veal parmigiana, lasagna, fish cakes,<br />\nmacaroni and cheese, and fried chicken.<br />\nThe good variety of cooked and fresh<br />\nvegetables are always plentiful. The desserts consist of apple, peach, and blueberry with cake<br />\ncombinations including some type of chocolate<br />\ncake,_ There _is soda, coffee, tea, milk, and an<br />\nassortment of fruit drinks.<br />\nFor the strategist who knows what he wants<br />\nout of an all-you-can-eat establishment, the<br />\n\"Smorgasbord\" is the ultimate challenge. It is<br />\nvery possible to get a very good meal there for<br /><br />\na very low price. Lunch, served every weekday<br />\nfrom 11:00 a.m. to 2:30 p.m. costs only $3.47<br />\nwhile dinner, served 4:00 to 8:00 p.m. weekdays<br />\nand all day Saturday and Sunday, is an<br />\neconomical $4.95.<br />\nThe main courses are the focal point of any<br />\nassault. They must be sampled and then the best<br />\nones should be attacked at a moderate, constant<br />\npace. Salads, breads, soups and vegetables<br />\nshould be consumed in small portions to prevent<br />\npremature fullness.<br />\nThe desserts are situated between the patron<br />\nand the main dishes, undoubtedly to tempt the<br />\nweaker and less skilled devourers into making a<br />\nsneak attack before the substantive foods have<br />\nbeen blitzed. These eye-pleasing and tasty<br />\ndesserts are quite good. Nevertheless, they should<br />\nnot be attacked before the main foods have been<br />\nthoroughly bombarded, nor can they be<br />\nassaulted on a full stomach. Careful deliberate<br />\ndecisions are the key to optimizing effectivenes3<br />\nat the \"Smorgasbord.\"<br />\nThe relaxed, quiet, unrushed atmosphere is<br />\nconducive to tactical planning. The place is very<br />\ncomfortable in this respect. Even the haphazard,<br />\nlight eater has a good time there, it seems. The<br />\nfood is wholesome, but not at all gourmet.<br />\nIf you enjoy relaxed, unlimited, inexpensive<br />\neating, then the Horn and Horn \"Smorgasbord\"<br />\nis the place for you to mark on your maps as the<br />\nnext target. Bring your heaviest artillery because<br />\nthe food keeps coming, and the variety makes<br />\nit difficult to anticipate the best courses of action.<br /><br />\neatures<br />\nAmillftt<br />\n\\<br /><br />\nHam on Wn,<br /><br />\nPeople Who've Beaten Me Up<br />\nBY MIKE KUN<br />\nMy nose has been broken 28 times. I swear<br />\nthat I'm not making that up-28 times. An xray of my nasal area looks kind of like a jigsaw<br />\npuzzle, although my doctor says it reminds him<br />\nof Hiroshima. You see, I used to get into a lot<br />\nof fights. My dad says it was because I was a<br />\nwise-ass. My mom said it was because all of the<br />\nother kids were jealous of me. My mom is a really nice lady. I like her.<br />\nThe following is a partial list of people who<br />\nhave done physical damage to me(most of these<br />\nencounters resulted in me having to cot:<br />\nton balls stuck up my nostrils for an extended<br />\nperiod of time):<br />\n1. Jeff Hill<br />\nJeff was a good friend of mine in grade school,<br />\nbut he was terminally hyperactive. We used to<br />\nsit next to each other in Mrs. Converse's social<br />\nstudies course, and when Mrs. Converse would<br />\nleave the room to readjust her slip, Jeff would<br />\nbelt me over the head with his binder. The one<br />\npleasure which I took in Jeff's hyperactivity was<br />\nthat he always managed to hurt himself. Once,<br />\nin the third grade, he broke his arm on a field<br />\ntrip to Newport, R.I.. He slept over at my house<br />\nlater that week, and when I wouldn't let him eat<br />\nmy new Avengers comic book, he bashed me in<br />\nthe face with his cast. I stopped breathing for<br />\nabout a week.<br />\n2. Tom Barry<br />\nTom was a neighbor in Rhode Island. We<br />\nstopped being friends when he drew a moustache<br />\non my Tom Seaver baseball card. Well, I got<br />\nreally angry and put his best frog under the tire<br />\nof his mom's car. When he found out, he came<br /><br />\nover to my house and gave me a really bad Indian rub on my right wrist and tried to shove my<br />\nturtle in my mouth. Then, he put dog manure<br />\nin my Red Sox batting helmet, but I didn't find<br />\nout about that until later.<br />\n3. Mr. Barry<br />\nMr. Barry was Tom's dad, and he had a really disgusting scar on his face which resembled<br />\nLake Champlain. He was really mad because he<br />\nhad bought that frog for Tom (I thought<br />\neveryone got their frogs over at Dubner's Pond).<br />\nThen he had the nerve to accuse me of setting<br />\nfire to their dog Pepper with my magnifying glass<br />\n(which I did but wasn't about to admit).<br />\nAnyhow, he chased me around for a while on<br />\nhis riding lawnmower before he rubbed my face<br />\nagainst his stucco house.<br />\n4. Todd Foxx<br />\nI called Todd a queer because,he was staring<br />\nat everyone in the shower after gym, and he took<br />\nit personally. He followed me home from school<br />\non his moped and broke my arm with his.<br />\nbaseball bat. Then I punched him in the mouth<br />\nand broke his jaw which was a really stupid thing<br />\nto do since it just made him angrier and he broke<br />\nmy nose. It was even stupider since Mr. Foxx was<br />\nmy soccer coach and made me sit on the bench<br />\nall season.<br />\n5. Doody Gumpis<br />\nDoody had the gall to tell me that Nancy<br />\nO'Hare, my junior high dream girl, had a<br />\ngoldfish-shaped mole on her left breast. Attempting to defend her honor, I got my ribs beat up,<br />\npretty good. Even worse, Doody ended up taking Nancy to the graduation dance, and, while<br />\ndoing the Latin hustle, he ripped off her dress<br />\nto reveal the mole. It was shaped more.like a<br /><br />\nwide-mouth bass than a goldfish, though.<br />\n6. The Ridgewood Braves basketball team<br />\nSometimes I get pretty excited when I'm in a<br />\nclose game. Sometimes I go a bit overboard.<br />\nAnyhow, this time we were up by four points<br />\nwith a minute to go, so they fouled me just to<br />\nstop the clock. Their center grabbed me around<br />\nthe neck and threw me down. So, I jumped up<br />\nand yelled, \"C'mon, I'll take you all on.\" They<br />\naccepted.<br />\n7. Scott Hilmer<br />\nI told everyone that I went out with Scott's<br />\nsister when I really didn't. She was so embarassed that she made her whole family move to<br />\nanother state. Scott got mad because he wanted<br />\nto stay.<br />\n8. Debbie Kastern<br />\nI would really rather not talk about this one,<br />\nokay?<br />\n9. Mr. Carlson<br />\nMr. Carlson was my homeroom teacher in<br />\nfifth grade. I once ran into him at a drugstore<br />\non a day when I had stayed home even though<br />\nI was supposed to give an oral report on the<br />\nhistory of Dutch housing. He said that he was<br />\nglad to see that I was feeling better. Then he ran<br />\ninto me with his car.<br />\n10. Mrs. Hallowell<br />\nMrs. Hallowell was our next door neighbor in<br />\nWalnut Creek, California. She got very upset<br />\nwhen I spit in the sterno during her Labor Day<br />\nparty and all the Swedish meatballs got cold. She<br />\nhit me over the head with some Corningware.<br />\n11. Two big guys who must be in a frat<br />\nI tried to give them beer from the \"waste<br />\nbucket\" at a college party. I learned that this was<br />\na mistake.<br /><br />\nThe Childhood of Charle8Village<br />\nBY NORMA PEREZ<br />\nThe Charles Village which was once considered afigment of Grace Darin's imagination<br />\nhas so firmly rooted its identity as an intellectual enclave in Baltimore, that many are unaware<br />\nthat it was born just fifteen years ago.<br />\nA good deal of the driving force behind<br />\nPeabody Heights' transition into Charles Village<br />\nin 1967 came from the fabrications of Grace<br />\nDarin, a villager dissatisfied with her area's lack<br />\nof identity and with its confusion over the<br />\nPeabody Conservatory area.<br />\nGrace Darin has resided in the Village since<br />\nthe late 1940's and was, at the time, a reporter<br />\nfor The Baltimore Sun. She convinced real estate<br />\ndealers that it would be profitable to plant promotions in their columns for a new center of intellectual creativity called Charles Village. Darin<br />\ndescribed the yet-to-be Charles Village in a manner alluring to the youth of the 60's. When Darin<br />\nwas asked by the elderly of the village why she<br />\npersisted in introducing such tomfoolery notions<br />\nin their, quiet, troublefree community, she<br />\nreplied, \"We have peace now, but it the peace<br />\nof the graveyard.\"<br />\nCharles Village became Darin's pet hobby. It<br />\nbegan as an indulgence which she planned to pursue for at least three years\u2014time enough for any<br />\nsubstantial changes in the scheme of the Village<br />\nto become evident. The result was ten years of<br />\ndedicated expenditure of energy and money. For<br />\nexample, Darin initiated, as well as financially<br /><br />\nl'he Margaret Brent School.<br /><br />\nsponsored, a newsletter which still circulates, as<br />\none promotional device. She recalls feeling<br />\nstrange when she saw one of her articles about<br />\nCharles Village make the cover of Sun Magazine<br />\nwithout having devised its appearance. Her<br />\nmemories of reading this publication resemble<br />\nthose of a mother witnessing the newborn she<br />\nhad carried for so long. Enthusiam for Grace<br />\nDarin's child, Charles Village, spread like<br />\nwildfire.<br />\nAs Darin had hoped, the young generation arrived in the village and caused a type of<br />\nintellectual revolution. Young parents brought<br />\nconcern for a better educational system.<br />\nThe Barkely-Brent Education Association was<br />\nformed to improve Barkely and Margaret Brent,<br />\nthe two best grammar schools in the Village.<br /><br />\nPhotos by Richard Hara<br /><br />\nMany designers were hired, and various grants<br />\nwere received Tor a creative playground project.<br />\nStan Edmeister, a sculptor and psychiatrist in<br />\nresidency at Hopkins, analyzed the psychological<br />\nmotivations of children at play there. Fellowships<br />\nwere arranged for teachers from these two<br />\nschools to enroll in summer courses. Streets for<br />\nPeople, an organization Grace Darin refers to<br />\nas the \"town guerilla group\" waged the battle<br />\nto ease parking restrictions on St. Paul and<br />\nMaryland streets. Neighborhood House Tours<br />\nwere established to encourage and display<br />\nrenovations. The Civic Association held a<br />\nfleamarket for several years.<br />\nOne of the most successful ventures in fundraising was the Charles Village Cookbook. It<br />\nwas of a homemade, typed format that became<br />\nso popular that additional printings were required. The motivation behind the cookbook was<br />\nto tap into varied groups of people, cutting<br />\nacross generational lines: everyone knows that<br />\ntheir grandmothers make the best oatmeal, that<br />\nmen are natural-born barbecuers and chefs, and<br />\neven kids discover unique goodies by experimental combinations. Cookbook dinners were held<br />\nfor people to bring dishes they had attempted.<br />\nTen years later, a second edition containing Indian, Chinese, and international recipes missing<br />\nfrom the first volume was printed. These additions indicated that Charles Village had attracted<br />\nmany students from abroad. Elderly people participated in the bustling culture of Charles Village<br />\nby writing journals of their pasts.<br />\nPeople living in Charles Village generally<br />\nrelished the village's innovative character,<br />\nregardless of their initial motivations for coming.

One<br />\nvarsity lacrosse. However, four Eagel<br />\ncoach<br />\ndescribed<br />\nyears ago a man came to Johns Stromberg as \"a very talented<br />\nKid with good hands who runs<br />\nroutes very well. He may not be<br />\nthe fastest guy (4.6 seconds in<br />\nthe 40 yard dash), but he has<br />\ngood technique and fundamentals.\" Even Eagle head coach<br />\nDick<br />\nVermeil<br />\npraised<br />\nStromberg when he said, \"this<br />\nguy can play in this league.\"<br />\nWhile Stromberg was impressing the Philadelphia<br />\ncoaching staff with his ability<br />\nand intelligence, Hopkins football fans kept a watchful eye on<br />\nthe PhiIly roster cuts. For<br />\nseveral weeks Stromberg's<br />\nname remained off the list, and<br />\nBlue Jay followers wondered<br /><br />\nwhether a Division 111 all-Star<br />\ncould really qualify \u2022for an<br />\nN.F.L. squad. The 'maybes'<br />\nturned to \"probablies\" as the<br />\nweeks passed, but when<br />\nStromberg pulled his hamstring<br />\nonly two weeks before the<br />\nopening preseason game, the<br />\nskeptics resurfaced. According<br />\nto some Philly coaches,<br />\nStromberg \"fell behind because<br />\nof the injury, and was not able<br />\nto really show his ability.\"<br />\nHowever, Philadelphia did<br />\nnot give up on the injured<br />\nreceiver. Stromberg returned<br />\nfor the second preseason game<br />\nand caught three passes.<br />\nAlthough he \"looked good\",<br />\nStromberg never overcame the<br />\ninjury and was released a few<br /><br />\nbelieve that the leg problem was<br />\nthe main reason for the<br />\ndecision.<br />\nTherefore, when<br />\nThe<br />\nNewsletter spoke to Stromberg,<br />\nhe seemed dissappointed, but<br />\nnot distraught. He believes that<br />\nhe is \"a better receiver than<br />\nsome of the ones on the team.\"<br />\nMore \u2022 importantly, he optimistically emphasized that he<br />\nwants to give pro football his<br />\n\"best shot\" and<br />\nthe<br />\nPhiladelphia experience die not<br />\nfullfill these expectations. To<br />\nacheive his goal, Stromberg last<br />\nweek signed a contract with the<br />\nUnited States Football League's<br />\nPhiladelphia Stars.<br />\nIn January, Bill Stromberg<br />\nwill suit up for his new team,<br />\nand by May he might well be<br />\ndays later. Many Eagle officials catching footballs on profesincluding Coach Vermeil, sional fields as he did at<br />\nHopkins head coach Jerry Homewood Field. Throughout<br />\nPfiefer and Stromber himself his career at Hopkins<br /><br />\nStromberg teamed with another<br />\ngraduated senior, quarterback<br />\nJim Margraff, to set many offensive records. As previously<br />\nnoted, Stromberg leads Division II and III in career receptions falling only two short ot<br />\nthe Division I record. Additionally, he is ranked third,<br /><br />\nbehind two quarterbacks, for<br />\ntotal -offense in Blue Jay<br />\nhistory. Finally, he has the<br />\nlongest reception, 97 yards, and<br />\nmost touchdowns by a Hopkins<br />\nplayer. Blue Jay coach Jerry<br />\nPfiefer, who came to Hopkins<br />\nwith Stromberg and Margreff,<br />\nsaid,\"We are going to miss<br />\nthem, not only their physical<br />\nabilities, but also their leadership qualities.\" He added<br />\nphilosophically, while describ<br />\ning this year's squad without his<br />\n, stars, that \"every year is an adjustment period.\" Similarly<br />\nBill Stromberg must adjust to<br />\npro football and show major<br />\nfootball fans what Blue Jav<br />\nsupporters saw for four years.<br /><br />\nHopkins University with similar<br />\nbut additional goals; Bill<br />\nStromberg wanted to become<br />\nthe best receiver in Hopkins<br />\nhistory.<br />\nStromberg not only became<br />\nthe best at Hopkins, his 259<br />\ncareer receptions make him the<br />\nall-time leading pass catcher in<br />\nNCAA Division II and III football history. In addition to<br />\nleading the Blue Jays to an impressive 7-2 1981 campaign, in<br />\nwhich he had 78 receptions, he<br />\nmaintained a high grade point<br />\naverage, earning him several<br />\nlob offers from major corporations.
