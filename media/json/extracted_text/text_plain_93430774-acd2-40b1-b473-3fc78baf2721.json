The Indians, who<br />\nwere the originators of this game, displayed unwonted sagacity in inventing a<br />\nform of exercise which tends to develop all the qualities of the perfect athlete,\u2014<br />\nmuscular prowess, speed, agility, dexterity, and together with these physical at<br />\ntributes, quick mental perception as well. The charm for the individual player<br />\nis far in excess of that afforded by either baseball or football, because of the continual excitement and uncertainty under which the player labors in never knowing where the next play is going to be. There is far more scientific individual<br />\nplay in lacrosse than in any other usual collegiate game, and it eliminates to a<br />\ngreat extent the ULTRA dangerous element of football. Perhaps I am a trifle<br />\nprejudiced in its favor, but I repeat that I consider it the very best form of exercise. All this is the player's side of it; but from the spectator's point of view<br />\nI consider it the most interesting because of the open work which permits a<br />\nclose observance of the game in all its details.<br />\nThough the game is being developed at more American colleges every year,<br />\nthe one reason why it has not yet superseded baseball is because it is not an<br />\nAmerican sport. It is a Canadian game, and baseball is a native American<br />\ngame. Therefore the American colleges, like Hopkins, C. C. N. Y., Stevens,<br />\nLehigh, etc., which have always kept the lacrosse standard on a high level, will<br />\nfind it hard to induce the other colleges to adopt it at the expense of football.<br />\nStill, it has grown, and will, I think, continue to grow in popularity.<br />\nDuring my entire career at the City College of New York, I engaged in all<br />\nathletic 'sports,\u2014baseball, football, and lacrosse; and in my graduating year<br />\nWas captain of the lacrosse team, succeeding Jack Curry, who, I believe, once<br />\ncoached Hopkins. Our team that year won the championship, and many of<br />\nOur League games were veritable \"hair-raisers.\" In our game with Lehigh we<br />\nwere defeated, and previous to that game the New York Athletic Club had<br />\nbeaten Lehigh, so, going by comparative scores, we seemed predestined to defeat<br />\nwhen our turn came to play N. Y. A. C. I remember the game perfectly as one<br />\nof the fastest and best contested I ever played, and only by the hardest kind of<br />\nwork did we succeed in scoring, thus defeating our rivals by the score of one to<br />\nnothing. It was flattering for me to note that on the All American lacrosse<br />\nteam of 1891-92, were four of my men.<br />\n44<br />\n<br />\n\f2<br />\n<br />\nTHE NEWS\u2014LETTER.<br />\n<br />\nSeveral times I have played against Stevens, and I must say I found them<br />\nrather rough in their style of play. My position on the lacrosse team was first<br />\ndefense.<br />\nI have met several men who have contributed largely to the success of lacrosse in Baltimore. Mr. Maddren, who, I have heard, \"made\" lacrosse at<br />\nHopkins, I met during his connection with the Crescents, and I became acquainted with the five Penniman boys in 1895, when, as a delegate to a convention at the Hopkins, I visited Baltimore for the first time.<br />\nVictor Mapes, who wrote my version of \"Don Caesar's Return\" was a Columbia man of great athletic standing, holding the American Intercollegiate<br />\nhurdle and broad jump records, His broad jump record of 22 feet 6 inches, was<br />\nonly recently broken. In 1891 Mapes was president of the American Intercollegiate Athletic Association, and I was treasurer; so it seems quite a coincidence<br />\nthat he and I should be associated now in our life work as we were in college<br />\ndays.<br />\nAfter graduating from the City College of New York I entered the New<br />\nYork School of Law. The same year I captained the Law School football team,<br />\nplaying, at different times, end and half back Incidentally I may state that, as<br />\nfar as I am aware, I was the first man to wear a rubber nose-guard on the football field. It was in a game with Fordham, where I was lined up against a<br />\nbig fellow, that I donned it for the first time. I found it extremely satisfactory,<br />\ninasmuch as I was spared the pain of a broken nose, though I must confess that<br />\nnose-guard felt awkward at first, and the astonishment created among both players and spectators was really amusing. It was in the same year, 1892, in a<br />\ngame against Rutgers that I sustained a severe injury which confined me to the<br />\nhospital for two months, and it was during this period that I finally determined<br />\nupon the stage as my life career.<br />\nCollege dramatics always proved of much interest to me, and I always entered into them with great spirit. We had a strong number of men at the C.<br />\nC. N. *Y., who showed histrionic ability, and our efforts were generally successful. Not only did we have plenty of sport getting up plays, but the real<br />\nadvantage as training for the stage was remarkable. The benefits derived from<br />\na college dramatic society are well worth any trouble necessary in organization.<br />\nBesides the college dramatic society to which I belonged, I was also a member<br />\nof nearly every amateur club in New York for five years.<br />\nIn addition to the academic training afforded by my college career, I consider the time spent there as valuable in laying a broad foundation for my life<br />\nwork, and I look back upon my college days as pleasant and well spent.''<br />\n<br />\nJAMES K. HACKETT.<br />\nTHE PERSECUTION OF MAN.<br />\n\u2014<br />\n<br />\nt<br />\n<br />\nHE powers of Smith College have shown a remarkable amount of acuteness<br />\nand ability to understand human nature in the means they have adopted<br />\nto abate, the male nuisance at the college.<br />\nThere had existed a mutual admiration society between the good looking<br />\nyoung ladies at Smith and the good looking young men at Amherst, which re-<br />\n<br />\n\fTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\n<br />\n3<br />\n<br />\nsuited in the almost eternal presence of Amherst men inside the walls of the<br />\nyoung ladies' seminary, not to mention innumerable little walks, and cozy little<br />\ntheatre parties of two. Every Saturday and Sunday the halls of the Smith<br />\nhomes were \"converted into reception rooms for Amherst fellows,\" so that the<br />\nwork for Monday\u2014and other days\u2014was neglected, in the pursuit of social<br />\npleasures. Of course the education of young women should be on more serious<br />\nlines than these, so the faculty thought stringent laws were necessary. A set<br />\nof rules were consequently drawn up, which are destined to put an end to all<br />\nthese frivolities. All walks, talks, and those cozy little theatre parties of two<br />\nwill have to be abandoned, unless the girl is engaged to the fellow. The penalty<br />\ncertainly is severe, but as students of human nature, we very much fear that the<br />\nparties concerned will not consider it in this light. It is extremely difficult for<br />\ncertain people to realize the value of careful oversight by one's elders and<br />\nbetters.<br />\nLater notice from Massachusetts Twenty engagements of Smith girls to<br />\nAmherst men were announced this week.<br />\n<br />\nSCHOLARS AS ATHLETES.<br />\nHE prominence of athletics as a fundamental feature in college life has<br />\ngrown ste dily the last few years. Probably the most patent reason for<br />\nthis advancement, and the liberal acknowledgement of athletics by college<br />\nauthorities, is the interest taken in sports by the scholastically inclined as well<br />\nas by the so called \"athletes.\" Each year the records show a large number of<br />\nmen carrying off academic honors, and winning athletic glory at the same time.<br />\nHere at Hopkins a glance will suffice to support this statement; some of the<br />\nbest men on the football, track, and lacrosse teams are honor men, and leaders of<br />\ntheir respective classes. At Columbia, last year, the report of the dean showed<br />\nthat twenty prominent athletes were among those receiving high academic<br />\nhonors, and at all the other colleges statistics point the same way. The reason<br />\nfor this is apparent, and is powerfully stated in the famous definition of education given by Thomas Huxley.<br />\n\"That man, I think, has had a liberal education, who has been so trained<br />\nin his youth that his body is the ready servant of his will and does with ease<br />\nand pleasure all the work that, as a mechanism, it is capable of; whose intellect<br />\nis a clear, cold, logic engine, with all its parts of equal strength, and in smooth<br />\nworking order; ready, like a steam engine, to be turned to any kind of work,<br />\nand spin the gossamers as well as forge the anchors of the mind; whose mind<br />\nis stoied with a knowledge of the great and fundamental truths of nature and<br />\nof the laws of her operations; one, who no stunted ascetic, is full of life and<br />\nfire, but whose passions are trained to come to heel by a vigorous will, the<br />\nservant of a tender conscience; who has learned to love all beauty, whether of<br />\nnature or of art, to hate all vileness, and to respect others as himself.\"<br />\n<br />\ne<br />\n<br />\n\f007--<br />\n<br />\nTHE NEWS\u2014LETTER.<br />\nWITH THE AID OF GEORGE ADE AND APOLOGIES TO<br />\nTHE AFORESAID.<br />\nNCE there was a Time when this University had not Yet been moved to<br />\nHomewood, because the last Thirty-Nine cents of an Endowment was<br />\nHard to Raise from the people of Baltimore. During this Period there<br />\nexisted In Two Classes of the University a Feeling that each one was Better<br />\nthan the Other, and it was often demonstrated that Such was the Case.<br />\nThe facts were that One of these Classes had been Hauled over the Rough<br />\nRoad of Book learning for a Year, while the other was a Young Infant, and had<br />\njust entered the Race for Knowing Things. For this reason the Former imagined<br />\nthat they were Hellers ad Libitum of the Neighborhood, and that the Other Class<br />\nshould do Fealty to Them; consequently, a spirit of Hostility Existed until Something had to be Decided. There being a Precedent that Such Feelings should be<br />\nsettled by a Football game, and in Case Some were alive after this was Over, a<br />\nCane rush should be instituted whereby the Rest might be killed without anyone<br />\nbeing Arrested for Manslaughter. These Classes decided that it was Up to Them<br />\nto do This.<br />\nWhen the Seventh Day of December, being the appointed time for the Killme quick, had arrived, the Junior Aggregate feeling that They were too much of a<br />\nSecond-to-None to be Hauled on the Baltimore Consolidated, procured the money<br />\nsomehow to Hire a Bus, or, maybe it is not Paid for yet; we don't know. It is<br />\nsaid, that the Freshmen were actuated by an Impulse to do the Same, but That<br />\nwas All. Anyhow, they all got There.<br />\nBefore any definite Steps of Procedure were taken, Both teams let their<br />\nPhisiognomies be Photographed, so that Mother might see how Brave her Boy<br />\nlooked before he was Served up to her on a Stretcher. After this they Backed<br />\nup opposite each other, and got Ready to do Biz. The Junior team felt from the<br />\nBeginning that they were to be Leading Lady during the whole Matinee, and went<br />\nat it in a King Midas sort of Way that suggested that Every time they Landed,<br />\nTouchdowns could be Seen.<br />\nBut there was One among the Other Team who had Some Nerve with him and<br />\nwas Willing to Work. The Rest of the Team felt that He would give them a<br />\nhappy Issue out of All their afflictions if he Could, and Helped him with all their<br />\nHeart. There were, on the Other hand,some ancient Aniniases among the Junior<br />\nTeam, who could identify Themselves as Handlers of the Pigskin as it Should be<br />\nHandled, and inteuded to Go Way up behind the Goal posts with the Ball and Sit<br />\ndown, when they Felt like it.<br />\nAlas, for these Gridiron Terrors! One Ham Jr. had rubbed some kind of<br />\nSalve into the oval,till it was Greasy as a Yard of Free Lunch,and had a Tendency<br />\nto play Hide and Seek with itself. The Juniors were frequently \"It.\"<br />\nDuring the first Half both Teams avoided the Goal Posts with such Precision<br />\nthat when time was Up there were no Touchdowns pinned to the Jackets of Either.<br />\nBut in the second Semi, the Juniors saw that their Reputation was at Stake, and<br />\nbegan to Pass the Pigskin up the Line at a frequent Rate, till two Touchdowns<br />\nand almost a Third was the Result of their Rushes. When the Agony was Over,<br />\n<br />\nO<br />\n<br />\n\fTHE NEWS\u2014LETTER.<br />\n<br />\n5<br />\n<br />\nthe Junior Ensemble could count Twelve Points for themselves, and the Freshites gave Evidence of That tired Feeling, and seemed to be Satisfied.<br />\nIn the Meantime, one of the Ancient order of Cop, with a Paunch that<br />\nHelped-to make Milwaukee-famous, had a Bad Dream, and began to do some<br />\nDuty on a Junior who had done Nothing, and said to him, Come with Me.<br />\nWhen this Ward-heeler reached the Station with his Victim, amid Shouts of<br />\nderision, which didn't seem to Phrase him, He was Told that he Bore about the<br />\nsame relation to the Force as the Appendix does to the Human Anatomy, and it<br />\nwas True. The Prisoner had now Become a Hero, and had Sympathy served up<br />\nto him in large Hunks. Maidens in the Grandstand Heaved heavy Sighs, Rolled<br />\ntheir Eyes Heavenward, and Said, Poor Mr. Bryan; isn't Thatjust Awful!<br />\nBut the Cane rush couldn't be Stopped on his Account, and the two Classes<br />\nfaced each other Desperately, with a Sigh of Regret that Such indeed was the Case.<br />\nWhen the whistle Blew, the Carnage began, and Many a Spectator's Soul<br />\nwithin him Burned to see the Exploits of those so Young. They Connected with<br />\na Crash, and many a Wretch at the Bottom of the Heap was heard to Curse unseen, and waste his Profanity on the Desert Air. Some who were so Unfortunate<br />\nas to Ring in a Little Late, leaped around on top of the Heap and Dished out<br />\nCourageous Words to their mates Below.<br />\nWhen enough Time was given for Those Underneath to be planted in Soil<br />\nand to Realize what a H\u2014 on Earth was, the whistle Blew again, to Show that<br />\nit was All over and the Ambulance Corps was in Order.<br />\nLater, it was Found that Eleven hands gripped the cane. Nine of these were<br />\nTraced to Grease Spots in the Ground,which were Analyzed and found to Contain<br />\nthe Essential Elements of Juniority. The other two were Followed to a wisp of<br />\nHair in the Soil, and found by a Reductio ad Absurdum to have Originally grown<br />\non the Pate of the Dickey bird. Now that It was Over, everybody seemed to be<br />\nHappy again, and, with the Exception of two or three Stray ears, and a Sprinkling of Teeth\u2014which were Identified and Claimed\u2014nobody was Hurt, and all<br />\nwere glad that Some one had Won. Happy youth who could Say that he was<br />\nthree layers Deep under the Cane, and would have had a Hand on it if \u2014. But<br />\nthe details are Many.<br />\nThe Victors again Mounted their Haul-me-Home and Travelled down the<br />\nStreet, giving Everybody the Glad Glance, while the Vanquished were Happy to<br />\nHear themselves Praised by Female admirers, and the Dickey bird could have<br />\nHad Several feminine Hearts to Do as he Pleased with if Some overheard Snags<br />\nof Conversation were Correct.<br />\nOn the Whole no one was Sorry that he had been There. It was Suggested<br />\nthat the Absence of a Coin grabber at the gate would Account for the numerousness of Wistful Watchers present, but Anyone who brought Friends with him<br />\nwould say This was a Lie, if you accused him of It.<br />\nMoral.

U.; or box 398, Medical School of Johns Hopkins Hospital.<br />\n<br />\nT HAS become almost a daily occurrence to read of the vast sums of money<br />\ngiven away in this country for the purpose of endowing colleges. Only<br />\nlast week we were astonished to read of an offer, made by Andrew Carnegie, of ten million dollars for the purpose of founding a National University,<br />\nand the very same paper informed us that the total value of gifts made by Mrs.<br />\nStanford, to Leland Stanford University, amounted to twenty-five millions.<br />\nWhile we congratulate the latter University upon its good fortune, we cannot<br />\nbut feel somewhat grieved over the apparent indifference manifested by Baltimoreans toward the Johns Hopkins University. Nearly a year ago two public<br />\nspirited gentlemen of this city presented our University with a valuable tract of<br />\nland, to be used as a site for new buildings, upon the condition that an endowment fund of one million dollars be raised. As yet this money has not been<br />\nforthcoming in spite of all the efforts made by the President and Trustees of the<br />\nUniversity, to appeal to the generosity, public spirit, and patriotism of Marylanders, and especially Baltimoreans. These citizens seem utterly blind to the<br />\nfact that by aiding the University they will be advancing their own interests,<br />\nand furthering the cause of humanity and civilization. The Johns Hopkins<br />\nUniversity is to-day a source of untold wealth and honor to this city and this<br />\nstate, and yet take away the support of a few of our loyal and most devoted<br />\nsupporters\u2014a handful of men who have given their time, talents, and money to<br />\nthe furtherance of higher education at our University\u2014and we might as well be<br />\non the other side of the ocean for all the interest taken in us, and encouragement and aid given us by the rest of Baltimore.

During Mr.<br />\nHackett's recent visit to Baltimore, as \"Don Caesar de Bazan,\" he very<br />\nkindly consented to furnish us with a leading article relative to his college days,<br />\nand more particularly to his athletic career, while at the C. C. N. Y. This<br />\narticle, by one who has been an all-round athlete, and who has excelled in lacrosse<br />\nand football, cannot fail to interest the student body. Mr. Hackett, with his<br />\nsuperb physique, manly bearing, and frank cordiality, is one of the finest types<br />\nof the American college man; a representative of that class of college men who,<br />\nof late years, have brought themselves to the very top of the ladder in every<br />\ncalling. Moreover Mr. Hackett possesses in abundance that most admirable<br />\nquality, college spirit, for, notwithstanding the fact that he has been out of college, and deeply engrossed in his dramatic work for nearly ten years, his college days are not forgotten, and to-day he discusses with vivacity and interest<br />\nthe lacrosse and foot ball battles he fought and won ten years ago. So we take<br />\npleasure in presenting our readers with an article by him who to-day stands in<br />\nthe foremost rank of the world's actors, and who is perhaps almost as well<br />\nknown by the name of Rudolph Rassendyl as by his own name, James K.<br />\nHackett.<br />\nT LAST forensic interest at Hopkins has manifested itself to the point of<br />\nintercollegiate debates. The question has been agitated a number of<br />\ntimes but never before has it taken definite shape. Now it is highly<br />\nprobable that next spring will witness, besides our annual Junior-Senior<br />\ndebate, a debate with some university of recognized standing, perhaps the<br />\nUniversity of South Carolina. There is every reason in the world why Hopkins should indulge in these debating contests, just as all other colleges do;<br />\nbut at the same time it is equally important that the adversary we choose<br />\nshould be a first-class college or university\u2014a foe, in every sense, worthy of<br />\nour steel. Our failure in the past to arouse sufficient interest among the student<br />\nbody to enable us to participate in intercollegiate debates, has been the cause of<br />\nsome wonder and comment among other colleges. This year our undergraduate<br />\ndepartment has evinced a desire to inaugurate the plan. It is an excellent idea,<br />\nand should receive the hearty support of both faculty and students. Hopkins<br />\ncertainly produces debating talent qualified to meet that of any other university. Already we have received a number of proposals to debate for colleges<br />\nand universities, north and south, and it only remains for us to use discrimination in choosing an antagonist.<br />\n<br />\n\fTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\n<br />\n8<br />\n<br />\nHE NEWS-LETTICR submits to its readers the following letter, and asks for<br />\nan expression of opinion upon the subject. The writer appears to be<br />\njustified in his objection to \"piling up,\" and though we have not considered the matter deeply, we think his suggestion good.<br />\n<br />\nt<br />\n<br />\nTo THE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\n<br />\nMR. EDITOR:<br />\nCan you suggest through the columns of your paper a substitute for our annual canerush; something by means of which future Junior and Freshman classes may be enabled<br />\nto work off their exuberant spirits. Last year, and year before last, I participated in the<br />\nrush, and this year, being a Senior, I looked on. From both observation and experience<br />\n(for both years I happened to be near the bottom of the pile) I am of the opinion that,<br />\nowing to the number of students which participate in it, the annual cane-rush is too dangerous a sport to be continued. Two years ago the president of our class had two ribs<br />\nbroken in the rush, this year the president of the Freshman class was picked up unconscious, and such injuries will frequently result when some seventy or eighty men are piled<br />\nup on one another in a writhing, struggling mass. It is absolutely necessary to have some<br />\ngeneral melee in which all members of both classes may participate, but why not substitute<br />\nsomething which will not necessitate nearly a hundred men piling upon one another, for<br />\nthose at the bottom must suffer. I would suggest ;a flag-fight which would be just as spirited, last a little longer, contain all the elements of a class \"scrap,\" and still avoid the<br />\npiling-up of an organized cane rush. What is the opinion of the student body?<br />\nA SENIOR.<br />\n<br />\nITHIN the next few weeks there will be at least one vacancy, and perhaps two or three, upon the staff of editors, and these vacancies will be<br />\nfilled from the Junior and Freshman classes. We strongly urge that<br />\nthose men desiring a place upon the paper, begin handing in specimens of their<br />\nwork at once. These should be in the form of accounts of concerts or games,<br />\noriginal matter, or any items of university news which may interest the student<br />\nbody. The Freshman class in particular we urge to exert themselves along<br />\nthis line.<br />\n<br />\nV<br />\n<br />\nTO AN OLD PHOTOGRAPH.<br />\n'Tis through a mist of years I gaze at thee,<br />\nSweet vision of the days that are no more,<br />\nWhile mem'ries fond and fancies odd and free<br />\nBreathe softly from the old times' golden shore.<br />\nI seem to hear thy voice so sweet and true,<br />\nTo feel the tender pressure of thy hands,<br />\nAnd see the lovelight in those -eyes of blue<br />\nThat speak of azure skies in far-off lands.<br />\nOhl heart of hearts, would that thou now were here<br />\nTo cast thy spell of love o'er ev'ry fear,<br />\nTo guide my soul from earth's dark, dreary way,<br />\nFrom sorrow's night to hope's bright dawning day.<br />\nR.

Since this time last year I've been through<br />\nsome fearful trials and hardships. I worked hard all the spring and managed<br />\nto pass enough examinations to get in the Johns Hopkins University. I<br />\nthought it was grand. You know it makes you feel fine to go to Hopkins.<br />\n(There are a crowd of fellows there, though, who haven't the first rudiments of<br />\ncommon politeness, and instead of welcoming me in a hospitable manner, they<br />\ntreated me like a little yellow dog.)<br />\nI went down there to study, and didn't propose to stand for any roughhouse, but they made me take off my hat,\u2014sometimes my shoes, pushed me<br />\nhead first out of the elevator, forced me to buy chocolate at the slot ma-<br />\n<br />\n\fTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\n<br />\n16<br />\n<br />\nchine, and insisted upon making me do the hoola-hoola dance on the trophyroom table. Now you know that wasn't fair. It wasn't wright.<br />\nUpon entering the university, I considered myself a man, and felt that I<br />\nought to shave; so I bought a mug and put it in the barber shop. The nasty,<br />\nmean things took it, and a few days afterward, made me stand on the lockers<br />\nunder the gymnasium, lather one of my fellow classmen out of my own mug,<br />\nand shave him with the butt end of a golf stick. Then he shaved me the same<br />\nway. I was so angry I most cried. But what could I do with the horrid<br />\ncreatures jeering at me and telling me not to whimper?<br />\nThese are only a few of the mean tricks, hut I think they are enough to<br />\nmake you pity me and put what I want in my stocking.<br />\nI am awful anxious to wear a black and blue jersey, hut haven't dared to<br />\ndo it yet; for I saw the juniors jerk one off a fellow's back so fast that I thought<br />\nhis arms would come too. After Christmas, though, I think they will let us<br />\nwear them, so please bring me one. I wear boy's size, No. 22.<br />\nI really think I am big enough to begin smoking, but hardly know whether<br />\nit would be healthy for me or not. You might bring me a pipe and I'll wait a<br />\nfew weeks before using it. I also want a cow bell for Christmas. Next year I<br />\nam going to ask you to bring me a cane. Please bring me these, Santa Claus.<br />\nI haven't had a very good time since September.<br />\nA FRESHMAN.<br />\nThe unfortunate freshman who wrote the above can hardly be blamed for<br />\nsaying that the treatment received at the hands of the juniors was not \"wright.\"<br />\nHe has evidently been one of the marks.<br />\nWe are glad to know that he is \"awful anxious\" to wear a black and blue<br />\njersey, and hope he will not be molested after Christmas for so doing.<br />\nLet him take hope in the thought that better times are coming.<br />\nY.

With this end<br />\nin view, the NEWS-LETTER publishes the following theatrical guide for the<br />\ncurrent week:<br />\nFord's\u2014Mrs. Carter in \"Dew-Berry.\" Mrs. Carter's sweet, domestic play,<br />\n\"Zaza,\" is fresh in the memory of University students.<br />\n<br />\n3<br />\n<br />\n\fTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\n<br />\n17<br />\n<br />\nAcademy\u2014The King's Carnivora\u2014First class \"Bridge\" show.<br />\nHolliday St.\u2014Select tragedy for the aesthetic. Material for the Dean's<br />\nEssay.<br />\nAuditorium\u2014White Rats Company. This cozy, home-like resort proves<br />\nparticularly attractive to Hopkins students. The sweet pastoral plays point<br />\ntheir own moral, and leave good impression upon the mind of verdant youth<br />\n(particularly Freshmen).<br />\nN. B.

It fills a position in Baltimore parallel to the Corcoran Gallery in<br />\nWashington. We append a few rules of the house:<br />\n1. You are requested to patronize our polite attendants. 2. You are requested to report to the bouncer any inattention on the part of the ushers. The<br />\nbouncer will see that you are promptly attended to. 3. Don't throw our glassware on the floor after you have finished examining its interior. It costs<br />\nmoney. 4. Leave your valuables at the ticket office before entering. The<br />\nhouse needs the money. 5. Refrain from making remarks about the actors or<br />\nactresses while the show is going on.

The Indians, who<br />\nwere the originators of this game, displayed unwonted sagacity in inventing a<br />\nform of exercise which tends to develop all the qualities of the perfect athlete,\u2014<br />\nmuscular prowess, speed, agility, dexterity, and together with these physical at<br />\ntributes, quick mental perception as well. The charm for the individual player<br />\nis far in excess of that afforded by either baseball or football, because of the continual excitement and uncertainty under which the player labors in never knowing where the next play is going to be. There is far more scientific individual<br />\nplay in lacrosse than in any other usual collegiate game, and it eliminates to a<br />\ngreat extent the ULTRA dangerous element of football. Perhaps I am a trifle<br />\nprejudiced in its favor, but I repeat that I consider it the very best form of exercise. All this is the player's side of it; but from the spectator's point of view<br />\nI consider it the most interesting because of the open work which permits a<br />\nclose observance of the game in all its details.<br />\nThough the game is being developed at more American colleges every year,<br />\nthe one reason why it has not yet superseded baseball is because it is not an<br />\nAmerican sport. It is a Canadian game, and baseball is a native American<br />\ngame. Therefore the American colleges, like Hopkins, C. C. N. Y., Stevens,<br />\nLehigh, etc., which have always kept the lacrosse standard on a high level, will<br />\nfind it hard to induce the other colleges to adopt it at the expense of football.<br />\nStill, it has grown, and will, I think, continue to grow in popularity.<br />\nDuring my entire career at the City College of New York, I engaged in all<br />\nathletic 'sports,\u2014baseball, football, and lacrosse; and in my graduating year<br />\nWas captain of the lacrosse team, succeeding Jack Curry, who, I believe, once<br />\ncoached Hopkins. Our team that year won the championship, and many of<br />\nOur League games were veritable \"hair-raisers.\" In our game with Lehigh we<br />\nwere defeated, and previous to that game the New York Athletic Club had<br />\nbeaten Lehigh, so, going by comparative scores, we seemed predestined to defeat<br />\nwhen our turn came to play N. Y. A. C. I remember the game perfectly as one<br />\nof the fastest and best contested I ever played, and only by the hardest kind of<br />\nwork did we succeed in scoring, thus defeating our rivals by the score of one to<br />\nnothing. It was flattering for me to note that on the All American lacrosse<br />\nteam of 1891-92, were four of my men.<br />\n44<br /><br />\n2<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS\u2014LETTER.<br /><br />\nSeveral times I have played against Stevens, and I must say I found them<br />\nrather rough in their style of play. My position on the lacrosse team was first<br />\ndefense.<br />\nI have met several men who have contributed largely to the success of lacrosse in Baltimore. Mr. Maddren, who, I have heard, \"made\" lacrosse at<br />\nHopkins, I met during his connection with the Crescents, and I became acquainted with the five Penniman boys in 1895, when, as a delegate to a convention at the Hopkins, I visited Baltimore for the first time.<br />\nVictor Mapes, who wrote my version of \"Don Caesar's Return\" was a Columbia man of great athletic standing, holding the American Intercollegiate<br />\nhurdle and broad jump records, His broad jump record of 22 feet 6 inches, was<br />\nonly recently broken. In 1891 Mapes was president of the American Intercollegiate Athletic Association, and I was treasurer; so it seems quite a coincidence<br />\nthat he and I should be associated now in our life work as we were in college<br />\ndays.<br />\nAfter graduating from the City College of New York I entered the New<br />\nYork School of Law. The same year I captained the Law School football team,<br />\nplaying, at different times, end and half back Incidentally I may state that, as<br />\nfar as I am aware, I was the first man to wear a rubber nose-guard on the football field. It was in a game with Fordham, where I was lined up against a<br />\nbig fellow, that I donned it for the first time. I found it extremely satisfactory,<br />\ninasmuch as I was spared the pain of a broken nose, though I must confess that<br />\nnose-guard felt awkward at first, and the astonishment created among both players and spectators was really amusing. It was in the same year, 1892, in a<br />\ngame against Rutgers that I sustained a severe injury which confined me to the<br />\nhospital for two months, and it was during this period that I finally determined<br />\nupon the stage as my life career.<br />\nCollege dramatics always proved of much interest to me, and I always entered into them with great spirit. We had a strong number of men at the C.<br />\nC. N. *Y., who showed histrionic ability, and our efforts were generally successful. Not only did we have plenty of sport getting up plays, but the real<br />\nadvantage as training for the stage was remarkable. The benefits derived from<br />\na college dramatic society are well worth any trouble necessary in organization.<br />\nBesides the college dramatic society to which I belonged, I was also a member<br />\nof nearly every amateur club in New York for five years.<br />\nIn addition to the academic training afforded by my college career, I consider the time spent there as valuable in laying a broad foundation for my life<br />\nwork, and I look back upon my college days as pleasant and well spent.''<br /><br />\nJAMES K. HACKETT.<br />\nTHE PERSECUTION OF MAN.<br />\n\u2014<br /><br />\nt<br /><br />\nHE powers of Smith College have shown a remarkable amount of acuteness<br />\nand ability to understand human nature in the means they have adopted<br />\nto abate, the male nuisance at the college.<br />\nThere had existed a mutual admiration society between the good looking<br />\nyoung ladies at Smith and the good looking young men at Amherst, which re-<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br /><br />\n3<br /><br />\nsuited in the almost eternal presence of Amherst men inside the walls of the<br />\nyoung ladies' seminary, not to mention innumerable little walks, and cozy little<br />\ntheatre parties of two. Every Saturday and Sunday the halls of the Smith<br />\nhomes were \"converted into reception rooms for Amherst fellows,\" so that the<br />\nwork for Monday\u2014and other days\u2014was neglected, in the pursuit of social<br />\npleasures. Of course the education of young women should be on more serious<br />\nlines than these, so the faculty thought stringent laws were necessary. A set<br />\nof rules were consequently drawn up, which are destined to put an end to all<br />\nthese frivolities. All walks, talks, and those cozy little theatre parties of two<br />\nwill have to be abandoned, unless the girl is engaged to the fellow. The penalty<br />\ncertainly is severe, but as students of human nature, we very much fear that the<br />\nparties concerned will not consider it in this light. It is extremely difficult for<br />\ncertain people to realize the value of careful oversight by one's elders and<br />\nbetters.<br />\nLater notice from Massachusetts Twenty engagements of Smith girls to<br />\nAmherst men were announced this week.<br /><br />\nSCHOLARS AS ATHLETES.<br />\nHE prominence of athletics as a fundamental feature in college life has<br />\ngrown ste dily the last few years. Probably the most patent reason for<br />\nthis advancement, and the liberal acknowledgement of athletics by college<br />\nauthorities, is the interest taken in sports by the scholastically inclined as well<br />\nas by the so called \"athletes.\" Each year the records show a large number of<br />\nmen carrying off academic honors, and winning athletic glory at the same time.<br />\nHere at Hopkins a glance will suffice to support this statement; some of the<br />\nbest men on the football, track, and lacrosse teams are honor men, and leaders of<br />\ntheir respective classes. At Columbia, last year, the report of the dean showed<br />\nthat twenty prominent athletes were among those receiving high academic<br />\nhonors, and at all the other colleges statistics point the same way. The reason<br />\nfor this is apparent, and is powerfully stated in the famous definition of education given by Thomas Huxley.<br />\n\"That man, I think, has had a liberal education, who has been so trained<br />\nin his youth that his body is the ready servant of his will and does with ease<br />\nand pleasure all the work that, as a mechanism, it is capable of; whose intellect<br />\nis a clear, cold, logic engine, with all its parts of equal strength, and in smooth<br />\nworking order; ready, like a steam engine, to be turned to any kind of work,<br />\nand spin the gossamers as well as forge the anchors of the mind; whose mind<br />\nis stoied with a knowledge of the great and fundamental truths of nature and<br />\nof the laws of her operations; one, who no stunted ascetic, is full of life and<br />\nfire, but whose passions are trained to come to heel by a vigorous will, the<br />\nservant of a tender conscience; who has learned to love all beauty, whether of<br />\nnature or of art, to hate all vileness, and to respect others as himself.\"<br /><br />\ne<br /><br />\n007--<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS\u2014LETTER.<br />\nWITH THE AID OF GEORGE ADE AND APOLOGIES TO<br />\nTHE AFORESAID.<br />\nNCE there was a Time when this University had not Yet been moved to<br />\nHomewood, because the last Thirty-Nine cents of an Endowment was<br />\nHard to Raise from the people of Baltimore. During this Period there<br />\nexisted In Two Classes of the University a Feeling that each one was Better<br />\nthan the Other, and it was often demonstrated that Such was the Case.<br />\nThe facts were that One of these Classes had been Hauled over the Rough<br />\nRoad of Book learning for a Year, while the other was a Young Infant, and had<br />\njust entered the Race for Knowing Things. For this reason the Former imagined<br />\nthat they were Hellers ad Libitum of the Neighborhood, and that the Other Class<br />\nshould do Fealty to Them; consequently, a spirit of Hostility Existed until Something had to be Decided. There being a Precedent that Such Feelings should be<br />\nsettled by a Football game, and in Case Some were alive after this was Over, a<br />\nCane rush should be instituted whereby the Rest might be killed without anyone<br />\nbeing Arrested for Manslaughter. These Classes decided that it was Up to Them<br />\nto do This.<br />\nWhen the Seventh Day of December, being the appointed time for the Killme quick, had arrived, the Junior Aggregate feeling that They were too much of a<br />\nSecond-to-None to be Hauled on the Baltimore Consolidated, procured the money<br />\nsomehow to Hire a Bus, or, maybe it is not Paid for yet; we don't know. It is<br />\nsaid, that the Freshmen were actuated by an Impulse to do the Same, but That<br />\nwas All. Anyhow, they all got There.<br />\nBefore any definite Steps of Procedure were taken, Both teams let their<br />\nPhisiognomies be Photographed, so that Mother might see how Brave her Boy<br />\nlooked before he was Served up to her on a Stretcher. After this they Backed<br />\nup opposite each other, and got Ready to do Biz. The Junior team felt from the<br />\nBeginning that they were to be Leading Lady during the whole Matinee, and went<br />\nat it in a King Midas sort of Way that suggested that Every time they Landed,<br />\nTouchdowns could be Seen.<br />\nBut there was One among the Other Team who had Some Nerve with him and<br />\nwas Willing to Work. The Rest of the Team felt that He would give them a<br />\nhappy Issue out of All their afflictions if he Could, and Helped him with all their<br />\nHeart. There were, on the Other hand,some ancient Aniniases among the Junior<br />\nTeam, who could identify Themselves as Handlers of the Pigskin as it Should be<br />\nHandled, and inteuded to Go Way up behind the Goal posts with the Ball and Sit<br />\ndown, when they Felt like it.<br />\nAlas, for these Gridiron Terrors! One Ham Jr. had rubbed some kind of<br />\nSalve into the oval,till it was Greasy as a Yard of Free Lunch,and had a Tendency<br />\nto play Hide and Seek with itself. The Juniors were frequently \"It.\"<br />\nDuring the first Half both Teams avoided the Goal Posts with such Precision<br />\nthat when time was Up there were no Touchdowns pinned to the Jackets of Either.<br />\nBut in the second Semi, the Juniors saw that their Reputation was at Stake, and<br />\nbegan to Pass the Pigskin up the Line at a frequent Rate, till two Touchdowns<br />\nand almost a Third was the Result of their Rushes. When the Agony was Over,<br /><br />\nO<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS\u2014LETTER.<br /><br />\n5<br /><br />\nthe Junior Ensemble could count Twelve Points for themselves, and the Freshites gave Evidence of That tired Feeling, and seemed to be Satisfied.<br />\nIn the Meantime, one of the Ancient order of Cop, with a Paunch that<br />\nHelped-to make Milwaukee-famous, had a Bad Dream, and began to do some<br />\nDuty on a Junior who had done Nothing, and said to him, Come with Me.<br />\nWhen this Ward-heeler reached the Station with his Victim, amid Shouts of<br />\nderision, which didn't seem to Phrase him, He was Told that he Bore about the<br />\nsame relation to the Force as the Appendix does to the Human Anatomy, and it<br />\nwas True. The Prisoner had now Become a Hero, and had Sympathy served up<br />\nto him in large Hunks. Maidens in the Grandstand Heaved heavy Sighs, Rolled<br />\ntheir Eyes Heavenward, and Said, Poor Mr. Bryan; isn't Thatjust Awful!<br />\nBut the Cane rush couldn't be Stopped on his Account, and the two Classes<br />\nfaced each other Desperately, with a Sigh of Regret that Such indeed was the Case.<br />\nWhen the whistle Blew, the Carnage began, and Many a Spectator's Soul<br />\nwithin him Burned to see the Exploits of those so Young. They Connected with<br />\na Crash, and many a Wretch at the Bottom of the Heap was heard to Curse unseen, and waste his Profanity on the Desert Air. Some who were so Unfortunate<br />\nas to Ring in a Little Late, leaped around on top of the Heap and Dished out<br />\nCourageous Words to their mates Below.<br />\nWhen enough Time was given for Those Underneath to be planted in Soil<br />\nand to Realize what a H\u2014 on Earth was, the whistle Blew again, to Show that<br />\nit was All over and the Ambulance Corps was in Order.<br />\nLater, it was Found that Eleven hands gripped the cane. Nine of these were<br />\nTraced to Grease Spots in the Ground,which were Analyzed and found to Contain<br />\nthe Essential Elements of Juniority. The other two were Followed to a wisp of<br />\nHair in the Soil, and found by a Reductio ad Absurdum to have Originally grown<br />\non the Pate of the Dickey bird. Now that It was Over, everybody seemed to be<br />\nHappy again, and, with the Exception of two or three Stray ears, and a Sprinkling of Teeth\u2014which were Identified and Claimed\u2014nobody was Hurt, and all<br />\nwere glad that Some one had Won.

U.; or box 398, Medical School of Johns Hopkins Hospital.<br /><br />\nT HAS become almost a daily occurrence to read of the vast sums of money<br />\ngiven away in this country for the purpose of endowing colleges. Only<br />\nlast week we were astonished to read of an offer, made by Andrew Carnegie, of ten million dollars for the purpose of founding a National University,<br />\nand the very same paper informed us that the total value of gifts made by Mrs.<br />\nStanford, to Leland Stanford University, amounted to twenty-five millions.<br />\nWhile we congratulate the latter University upon its good fortune, we cannot<br />\nbut feel somewhat grieved over the apparent indifference manifested by Baltimoreans toward the Johns Hopkins University. Nearly a year ago two public<br />\nspirited gentlemen of this city presented our University with a valuable tract of<br />\nland, to be used as a site for new buildings, upon the condition that an endowment fund of one million dollars be raised. As yet this money has not been<br />\nforthcoming in spite of all the efforts made by the President and Trustees of the<br />\nUniversity, to appeal to the generosity, public spirit, and patriotism of Marylanders, and especially Baltimoreans. These citizens seem utterly blind to the<br />\nfact that by aiding the University they will be advancing their own interests,<br />\nand furthering the cause of humanity and civilization. The Johns Hopkins<br />\nUniversity is to-day a source of untold wealth and honor to this city and this<br />\nstate, and yet take away the support of a few of our loyal and most devoted<br />\nsupporters\u2014a handful of men who have given their time, talents, and money to<br />\nthe furtherance of higher education at our University\u2014and we might as well be<br />\non the other side of the ocean for all the interest taken in us, and encouragement and aid given us by the rest of Baltimore. Truly a \"prophet is not with-<br /><br />\n3<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS\u2014LETTER.<br /><br />\n7<br /><br />\nout honor save in his own country,\" and the Johns Hopkins University, esteemed and respected by Europe, and most of America, is treated with indifference, and coldly refused support by Maryland.<br /><br />\nHE NEWS-LETTER calls special attention to the leading article in this issue,<br /><br />\nZ<br /><br />\nby the, famous American actor, Mr. James K. Hackett. During Mr.<br />\nHackett's recent visit to Baltimore, as \"Don Caesar de Bazan,\" he very<br />\nkindly consented to furnish us with a leading article relative to his college days,<br />\nand more particularly to his athletic career, while at the C. C. N. Y. This<br />\narticle, by one who has been an all-round athlete, and who has excelled in lacrosse<br />\nand football, cannot fail to interest the student body. Mr. Hackett, with his<br />\nsuperb physique, manly bearing, and frank cordiality, is one of the finest types<br />\nof the American college man; a representative of that class of college men who,<br />\nof late years, have brought themselves to the very top of the ladder in every<br />\ncalling. Moreover Mr. Hackett possesses in abundance that most admirable<br />\nquality, college spirit, for, notwithstanding the fact that he has been out of college, and deeply engrossed in his dramatic work for nearly ten years, his college days are not forgotten, and to-day he discusses with vivacity and interest<br />\nthe lacrosse and foot ball battles he fought and won ten years ago. So we take<br />\npleasure in presenting our readers with an article by him who to-day stands in<br />\nthe foremost rank of the world's actors, and who is perhaps almost as well<br />\nknown by the name of Rudolph Rassendyl as by his own name, James K.<br />\nHackett.<br />\nT LAST forensic interest at Hopkins has manifested itself to the point of<br />\nintercollegiate debates. The question has been agitated a number of<br />\ntimes but never before has it taken definite shape. Now it is highly<br />\nprobable that next spring will witness, besides our annual Junior-Senior<br />\ndebate, a debate with some university of recognized standing, perhaps the<br />\nUniversity of South Carolina. There is every reason in the world why Hopkins should indulge in these debating contests, just as all other colleges do;<br />\nbut at the same time it is equally important that the adversary we choose<br />\nshould be a first-class college or university\u2014a foe, in every sense, worthy of<br />\nour steel. Our failure in the past to arouse sufficient interest among the student<br />\nbody to enable us to participate in intercollegiate debates, has been the cause of<br />\nsome wonder and comment among other colleges. This year our undergraduate<br />\ndepartment has evinced a desire to inaugurate the plan. It is an excellent idea,<br />\nand should receive the hearty support of both faculty and students. Hopkins<br />\ncertainly produces debating talent qualified to meet that of any other university. Already we have received a number of proposals to debate for colleges<br />\nand universities, north and south, and it only remains for us to use discrimination in choosing an antagonist.<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br /><br />\n8<br /><br />\nHE NEWS-LETTICR submits to its readers the following letter, and asks for<br />\nan expression of opinion upon the subject. The writer appears to be<br />\njustified in his objection to \"piling up,\" and though we have not considered the matter deeply, we think his suggestion good.<br /><br />\nt<br /><br />\nTo THE NEWS-LETTER.<br /><br />\nMR. EDITOR:<br />\nCan you suggest through the columns of your paper a substitute for our annual canerush; something by means of which future Junior and Freshman classes may be enabled<br />\nto work off their exuberant spirits. Last year, and year before last, I participated in the<br />\nrush, and this year, being a Senior, I looked on. From both observation and experience<br />\n(for both years I happened to be near the bottom of the pile) I am of the opinion that,<br />\nowing to the number of students which participate in it, the annual cane-rush is too dangerous a sport to be continued. Two years ago the president of our class had two ribs<br />\nbroken in the rush, this year the president of the Freshman class was picked up unconscious, and such injuries will frequently result when some seventy or eighty men are piled<br />\nup on one another in a writhing, struggling mass. It is absolutely necessary to have some<br />\ngeneral melee in which all members of both classes may participate, but why not substitute<br />\nsomething which will not necessitate nearly a hundred men piling upon one another, for<br />\nthose at the bottom must suffer. I would suggest ;a flag-fight which would be just as spirited, last a little longer, contain all the elements of a class \"scrap,\" and still avoid the<br />\npiling-up of an organized cane rush. What is the opinion of the student body?<br />\nA SENIOR.<br /><br />\nITHIN the next few weeks there will be at least one vacancy, and perhaps two or three, upon the staff of editors, and these vacancies will be<br />\nfilled from the Junior and Freshman classes. We strongly urge that<br />\nthose men desiring a place upon the paper, begin handing in specimens of their<br />\nwork at once. These should be in the form of accounts of concerts or games,<br />\noriginal matter, or any items of university news which may interest the student<br />\nbody. The Freshman class in particular we urge to exert themselves along<br />\nthis line.<br /><br />\nV<br /><br />\nTO AN OLD PHOTOGRAPH.<br />\n'Tis through a mist of years I gaze at thee,<br />\nSweet vision of the days that are no more,<br />\nWhile mem'ries fond and fancies odd and free<br />\nBreathe softly from the old times' golden shore.<br />\nI seem to hear thy voice so sweet and true,<br />\nTo feel the tender pressure of thy hands,<br />\nAnd see the lovelight in those -eyes of blue<br />\nThat speak of azure skies in far-off lands.<br />\nOhl heart of hearts, would that thou now were here<br />\nTo cast thy spell of love o'er ev'ry fear,<br />\nTo guide my soul from earth's dark, dreary way,<br />\nFrom sorrow's night to hope's bright dawning day.<br />\nR.

After Christmas, though, I think they will let us<br />\nwear them, so please bring me one. I wear boy's size, No. 22.<br />\nI really think I am big enough to begin smoking, but hardly know whether<br />\nit would be healthy for me or not. You might bring me a pipe and I'll wait a<br />\nfew weeks before using it. I also want a cow bell for Christmas. Next year I<br />\nam going to ask you to bring me a cane.
