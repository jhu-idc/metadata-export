Dissertation.<br />\nThe latest publication of the Johns<br />\nHopkins Press is a substantial, and<br />\nyet interesting contribution to the<br />\nknowledge of the French Revolution<br />\nand its effect on English public opinion.<br />\nDr. Laprade undertook his<br />\nstudy with the purpose of showing<br />\nto what extent the English social and<br />\npolitical life of the period contemporaneous with the French Revolution was influenced by that event, or,<br />\nin other words, whether the popular<br />\nagitations in England, which attracted the attention of the English government at this time owed their origin to the revolution taking place in<br />\nFrance. Some of these conditions in<br />\nEngland were, the author says due<br />\nto inside influences, but nevertheless the effect which the French<br />\nRevolution had upon the political<br />\ntho' ght of the great English leaders<br />\nsuch as Pitt, Burke and other cabinet officials is noticeable.<br />\nThe author, after what must have<br />\nbeen a vast amount of work in the<br />\nlibraries of Baltimore, Washington,<br />\nand London, has analyzed very carefully and critically the influence<br />\nwhich worked upon the political literature of the day and the corresinnding reaction upon the policies of<br />\nthe goN ernr lent.<br />\nDr. Laprade presents the following conclusions: \"In its early stages<br />\nthe French Revolution was regarded favorably by the majority of Engw%s corr;dered a subject rather for speculation than as<br />\nvital to the interests of England.<br />\nGradually the favorable view of the<br />\nrevolution gave way to one that was<br />\ndistinctly hostile, due as it is commonly supposed to the writings of<br />\nEdmund Burke. We believe, however, that this change of opinion may<br />\nbe attributed in a slight measure, if<br />\nat all, to the advocacy of the great<br />\norator, but unexpected by the deliberate efforts of the adherents of William Pitt in order to secure his political advantage. .<br />\n..<br />\n\"It is therefore, reasonable to conclude that the uprising in France playedbut a minor role in the dramatic history of England in the years from<br />\n1789 to 1797, except as far as it was<br />\nused by Pitt and his colleagues for<br />\ntheir own political purposes as a future and for reviving the old time<br />\nstruggle with France for supremacy<br />\nin the commercial and the colonial<br />\nworld.\"<br />\nDr. Laprade's conclusion seems to<br />\nindicate that the research which he<br />\nhas done was useless, except so far<br />\nas it affected Pitt and his associates.<br />\nA better title for the work, it seems<br />\nto us, would have been English Public Opinion and the French Revolution, with incidental allusions to Pitt<br />\nand his followers in so far as their<br />\nopinions were part of the political<br />\nthought of the time. Then the volume would have made a capital coin-<br />\n<br />\n21,<br />\n<br />\n1910.<br />\n<br />\npanion work to\"Contemporary American Opinions of the French Revolution,\" by C. D. Hazen, published as<br />\nan extra volume to the \"Studies.\"<br />\nNow, after being told in the preface<br />\nthat the work is to treat the effect<br />\nupon \"the English Social Organization as a Whole,\" and learning that<br />\nthe real effect is upon Pitt, the scope<br />\nof the study seems to have been<br />\ngreatly narrowed and the vast amount<br />\nof literature which explored seems to<br />\nhave no bearing upon the conclusion.<br />\nIn other words, there was no reference upon England as a whole; therefore the title is misleading. The influence upon Pitt forms only a small<br />\npart of the work and so the rest is<br />\nuseless. The better method, as we<br />\nhave said, would have been to treat<br />\nthe political thought as a whole,<br />\nand make conclusions with regard<br />\nto it.<br />\nINTERCOLLEGIATE ITEMS<br />\nCongratulations to Columbia for<br />\nhaving a president who came out openly in favor of academic credit being given to managers of athletic<br />\nteams, musical and dramatic clubs,<br />\nand editors of college publications.<br />\nPurdue has refused to grant the<br />\nathletic insignia to its football team<br />\nthis season on the ground that it was<br />\nnot up to the usual standard.

Dissertation.<br />\nThe latest publication of the Johns<br />\nHopkins Press is a substantial, and<br />\nyet interesting contribution to the<br />\nknowledge of the French Revolution<br />\nand its effect on English public opinion.<br />\nDr. Laprade undertook his<br />\nstudy with the purpose of showing<br />\nto what extent the English social and<br />\npolitical life of the period contemporaneous with the French Revolution was influenced by that event, or,<br />\nin other words, whether the popular<br />\nagitations in England, which attracted the attention of the English government at this time owed their origin to the revolution taking place in<br />\nFrance. Some of these conditions in<br />\nEngland were, the author says due<br />\nto inside influences, but nevertheless the effect which the French<br />\nRevolution had upon the political<br />\ntho' ght of the great English leaders<br />\nsuch as Pitt, Burke and other cabinet officials is noticeable.<br />\nThe author, after what must have<br />\nbeen a vast amount of work in the<br />\nlibraries of Baltimore, Washington,<br />\nand London, has analyzed very carefully and critically the influence<br />\nwhich worked upon the political literature of the day and the corresinnding reaction upon the policies of<br />\nthe goN ernr lent.<br />\nDr. Laprade presents the following conclusions: \"In its early stages<br />\nthe French Revolution was regarded favorably by the majority of Engw%s corr;dered a subject rather for speculation than as<br />\nvital to the interests of England.<br />\nGradually the favorable view of the<br />\nrevolution gave way to one that was<br />\ndistinctly hostile, due as it is commonly supposed to the writings of<br />\nEdmund Burke. We believe, however, that this change of opinion may<br />\nbe attributed in a slight measure, if<br />\nat all, to the advocacy of the great<br />\norator, but unexpected by the deliberate efforts of the adherents of William Pitt in order to secure his political advantage. .<br />\n..<br />\n\"It is therefore, reasonable to conclude that the uprising in France playedbut a minor role in the dramatic history of England in the years from<br />\n1789 to 1797, except as far as it was<br />\nused by Pitt and his colleagues for<br />\ntheir own political purposes as a future and for reviving the old time<br />\nstruggle with France for supremacy<br />\nin the commercial and the colonial<br />\nworld.\"<br />\nDr. Laprade's conclusion seems to<br />\nindicate that the research which he<br />\nhas done was useless, except so far<br />\nas it affected Pitt and his associates.<br />\nA better title for the work, it seems<br />\nto us, would have been English Public Opinion and the French Revolution, with incidental allusions to Pitt<br />\nand his followers in so far as their<br />\nopinions were part of the political<br />\nthought of the time. Then the volume would have made a capital coin-<br /><br />\n21,<br /><br />\n1910.<br /><br />\npanion work to\"Contemporary American Opinions of the French Revolution,\" by C. D. Hazen, published as<br />\nan extra volume to the \"Studies.\"<br />\nNow, after being told in the preface<br />\nthat the work is to treat the effect<br />\nupon \"the English Social Organization as a Whole,\" and learning that<br />\nthe real effect is upon Pitt, the scope<br />\nof the study seems to have been<br />\ngreatly narrowed and the vast amount<br />\nof literature which explored seems to<br />\nhave no bearing upon the conclusion.<br />\nIn other words, there was no reference upon England as a whole; therefore the title is misleading. The influence upon Pitt forms only a small<br />\npart of the work and so the rest is<br />\nuseless. The better method, as we<br />\nhave said, would have been to treat<br />\nthe political thought as a whole,<br />\nand make conclusions with regard<br />\nto it.<br />\nINTERCOLLEGIATE ITEMS<br />\nCongratulations to Columbia for<br />\nhaving a president who came out openly in favor of academic credit being given to managers of athletic<br />\nteams, musical and dramatic clubs,<br />\nand editors of college publications.<br />\nPurdue has refused to grant the<br />\nathletic insignia to its football team<br />\nthis season on the ground that it was<br />\nnot up to the usual standard.
