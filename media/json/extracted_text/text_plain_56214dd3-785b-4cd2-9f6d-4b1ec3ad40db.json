Loyola's action is particularly gracious, may we be<br />\npermitted to say, in view of the unfortunate pettinesses that have<br />\narisen in past relations between her and Johns Hopkins. For this<br />\nreason, therefore, her offer will be even more appreciated, and is,<br />\nmoreover, an omen of an era of good will between the two colleges.<br />\n<br />\nREVERIE<br />\nWithin the next two months the class of 1928 will have resigned<br />\nits offices in the activities of the college, will have finished a complete course in reminiscences, and have begun to worry about what<br />\nwill become of them in June. Oh, yes, some few poor scapegoats<br />\nwill continue to slave on through May: the editors of the Hullabaloo, the recipients of Phi Beta Kappa who feel that they must<br />\ncontinue to uphold their hard-earned standards, and, with unfeigned anxiety, those seniors who must get 7.0's in all their<br />\nsubjects in order to graduate.<br />\nSome one hundred and twenty-five men will receive degrees in<br />\nJune, and then sever their official connections with Hopkins. They<br />\nwill become engineers, or medical students, or Babbitts, or law students, or loafers in their fathers' offices, or maybe even teachers<br />\nor coaches or candidates for Ph. D.'s.

Loyola's action is particularly gracious, may we be<br />\npermitted to say, in view of the unfortunate pettinesses that have<br />\narisen in past relations between her and Johns Hopkins. For this<br />\nreason, therefore, her offer will be even more appreciated, and is,<br />\nmoreover, an omen of an era of good will between the two colleges.<br /><br />\nREVERIE<br />\nWithin the next two months the class of 1928 will have resigned<br />\nits offices in the activities of the college, will have finished a complete course in reminiscences, and have begun to worry about what<br />\nwill become of them in June. Oh, yes, some few poor scapegoats<br />\nwill continue to slave on through May: the editors of the Hullabaloo, the recipients of Phi Beta Kappa who feel that they must<br />\ncontinue to uphold their hard-earned standards, and, with unfeigned anxiety, those seniors who must get 7.0's in all their<br />\nsubjects in order to graduate.<br />\nSome one hundred and twenty-five men will receive degrees in<br />\nJune, and then sever their official connections with Hopkins. They<br />\nwill become engineers, or medical students, or Babbitts, or law students, or loafers in their fathers' offices, or maybe even teachers<br />\nor coaches or candidates for Ph. D.'s. The graduates of the School<br />\nof Business Economics can always ,secure positions With prosperous insurance companies or bond houses, or the street railways company; the E. E.'s and M.

All of them, anyhow,<br />\nwill suddenly find out that it isn't nearly as pleasant to be at work<br />\nat 8.30 every morning and sit around waiting for something to<br />\nwin up, because one has to eat, than to go to a pleasant 9.30, take<br />\nnotes or not take notes, as the spirit moves one, do a bit of cursory<br />\ncollateral reading, and take from an hour to the whole afternoon<br />\nfor lunch! \u2022<br />\nBy this time, probably, we have been maligned for dragging any<br />\npatient reader this far without having said one single thing that<br />\nhe, poor soul, didn't know before.
