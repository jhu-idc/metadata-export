The Johns Hopkins University<br />\nshould have teams which fairly<br />\nrepresent the University.<br />\n2. The University has five hundred and sixty-five graduate and<br />\nmedical students .and one hundred<br />\nahd eighty2one undergraduates (including- specials).<br />\n3. These grads and meds. have,<br />\nin nearly every instance, already<br />\nSpent four years, or more, in college.<br />\n4. The four-year rule originated<br />\nat undergraduate colleges, where<br />\nthe full course is four years. It<br />\nWas never designed to bar bona<br />\nfide students from games, but<br />\nSolely to prevent athletes from<br />\nstaying in college for athletic purPoses after four years.<br />\n5. To apply it to a university,<br />\nseventy-five per cent, of whose students have already spent four<br />\nYears, or more, in college, would<br />\ntend to work a serious injustice.<br />\n<br />\nHUTZLER 131WHEM<br />\nJANUARY REDUCTIONS<br />\nIN OUR<br />\n<br />\nMEN'S STORE<br />\n$2.50 and $3.00 Shirts for $1.95<br />\n$2.00 Shirts for $1.38<br />\n$1.50 Shills fur $1.15<br />\nOne-third off usual price of Turkish<br />\nend Blanket Robes.<br />\n<br />\nTHE ELECTRIC LINE<br />\nTHE BEST WAY TO TRAVEL BETWEEN<br />\n<br />\nWashington=Baltimore=Annapolis<br />\nFast and Frequent Service Every Thirty Minutes<br />\nBetween Baltimore and Washington, From 6.00<br />\nA.

This was never the intent<br />\nof the framers of the rule.<br />\nImagine anyone, for example,<br />\nendeavoring to apply such a rule<br />\nto an institution, every one of whose<br />\nstudents had already spent four<br />\nyears in college.<br />\n6. Hopkins has never been bothered by \"athletic students.\" The<br />\nman who endeavored to enter the<br />\nHopkins Medical School for the<br />\npurpose of playing on a team would<br />\nquickly find his way to the psychiatric ward.<br />\n7. The intent of the rule to secure only bona fide students and to<br />\nbar \"athletic students\" is subserved<br />\nat the Johns Hopkins University<br />\nby the faculty rules now in existence. These rules require every<br />\nstudent to be certified to by<br />\nfaculty representatives as a bona<br />\nfide student; and, further, such student must have an average of<br />\nseventy per cent., or better, in his<br />\nstudies.<br />\nEvery team that plays Hopkins<br />\nmay rely upon the fact that her<br />\nmen are bona fide students of certified amateur standing.<br />\n8. We want good games at<br />\nHomewood, with good schedules.<br />\nTo do this we must have representative teams\u2014grads and undergrads\u2014and not endeavor to apply<br />\nundergraduate rules to both alike.<br />\nReasons for the four-year rule:<br />\n1. Other colleges have the fouryear rule. A list of forty-four<br />\ncolleges is given.<br />\nAns.\u2014Every one of these colleges<br />\nis undergraduate. Hopkins stands<br />\npractically alone in its percentage<br />\nof graduate students. A graduate<br />\ncollege course is eight years; you<br />\ncannot put a four-year suit on an<br />\neight-year boy and expect him to<br />\nindulge in athletics without hampering him and endangering the fouryear suit.<br />\n2. It won't hurt.<br />\nAns.\u2014A highly \"immoral\" reason for adopting a principle advocated on \"moral' grounds.<br />\n3.

U.,<br />\nand for many years the delegate<br />\nfrom the Intercollegiate Athletic<br />\nAssociation. Mr. Kirby is careful<br />\nto indicate that the letter expresses<br />\nonly his personal opinion:<br />\n\"Coming to the so-called fouryear rule, I personally see no reason why Johns Hopkins should debar a great many of its students<br />\nwho desire to take part in sport<br />\nfrom so doing, eielier by reason of<br />\nthe four-year rule or the one-year<br />\nrule. Athletic competition is, after<br />\nall, only a means of recreation;<br />\nand, more important than this, only<br />\nthe means to an end and not the<br />\nend itself; and when we find a<br />\n<br />\n3<br />\nuniversity with the high ideals of<br />\nJohns Hopkins, and with other universities willing to compete with its<br />\nstudents, be they graduates of other<br />\nuniversities or not, I personally<br />\ncan see no reason why any, who are<br />\nscholastically eligible, should not be<br />\npermitted to continue their athletic careers.\"<br />\n=111=1111\u2022111=1.11<br />\nWalter Vincent Johnson.<br />\n<br />\nWalter V lucent Johnson, A.

The Johns Hopkins University<br />\nshould have teams which fairly<br />\nrepresent the University.<br />\n2. The University has five hundred and sixty-five graduate and<br />\nmedical students .and one hundred<br />\nahd eighty2one undergraduates (including- specials).<br />\n3. These grads and meds. have,<br />\nin nearly every instance, already<br />\nSpent four years, or more, in college.<br />\n4. The four-year rule originated<br />\nat undergraduate colleges, where<br />\nthe full course is four years. It<br />\nWas never designed to bar bona<br />\nfide students from games, but<br />\nSolely to prevent athletes from<br />\nstaying in college for athletic purPoses after four years.<br />\n5. To apply it to a university,<br />\nseventy-five per cent, of whose students have already spent four<br />\nYears, or more, in college, would<br />\ntend to work a serious injustice.<br /><br />\nHUTZLER 131WHEM<br />\nJANUARY REDUCTIONS<br />\nIN OUR<br /><br />\nMEN'S STORE<br />\n$2.50 and $3.00 Shirts for $1.95<br />\n$2.00 Shirts for $1.38<br />\n$1.50 Shills fur $1.15<br />\nOne-third off usual price of Turkish<br />\nend Blanket Robes.<br /><br />\nTHE ELECTRIC LINE<br />\nTHE BEST WAY TO TRAVEL BETWEEN<br /><br />\nWashington=Baltimore=Annapolis<br />\nFast and Frequent Service Every Thirty Minutes<br />\nBetween Baltimore and Washington, From 6.00<br />\nA.

This was never the intent<br />\nof the framers of the rule.<br />\nImagine anyone, for example,<br />\nendeavoring to apply such a rule<br />\nto an institution, every one of whose<br />\nstudents had already spent four<br />\nyears in college.<br />\n6. Hopkins has never been bothered by \"athletic students.\" The<br />\nman who endeavored to enter the<br />\nHopkins Medical School for the<br />\npurpose of playing on a team would<br />\nquickly find his way to the psychiatric ward.<br />\n7. The intent of the rule to secure only bona fide students and to<br />\nbar \"athletic students\" is subserved<br />\nat the Johns Hopkins University<br />\nby the faculty rules now in existence. These rules require every<br />\nstudent to be certified to by<br />\nfaculty representatives as a bona<br />\nfide student; and, further, such student must have an average of<br />\nseventy per cent., or better, in his<br />\nstudies.<br />\nEvery team that plays Hopkins<br />\nmay rely upon the fact that her<br />\nmen are bona fide students of certified amateur standing.<br />\n8. We want good games at<br />\nHomewood, with good schedules.<br />\nTo do this we must have representative teams\u2014grads and undergrads\u2014and not endeavor to apply<br />\nundergraduate rules to both alike.<br />\nReasons for the four-year rule:<br />\n1. Other colleges have the fouryear rule. A list of forty-four<br />\ncolleges is given.<br />\nAns.\u2014Every one of these colleges<br />\nis undergraduate. Hopkins stands<br />\npractically alone in its percentage<br />\nof graduate students. A graduate<br />\ncollege course is eight years; you<br />\ncannot put a four-year suit on an<br />\neight-year boy and expect him to<br />\nindulge in athletics without hampering him and endangering the fouryear suit.<br />\n2. It won't hurt.<br />\nAns.\u2014A highly \"immoral\" reason for adopting a principle advocated on \"moral' grounds.<br />\n3.

Better teams.<br />\nAns.\u2014A little illogical to expect<br />\nbetter teams by excluding better<br />\nmen.<br />\nIt has been urged that Johns<br />\nHopkins University adopt,the rule<br />\nand try it.

It would<br />\nthen be too late to \"educate the<br />\npublic.\" It's like going into a<br />\nnunnery; once in, whether you<br />\nmake a mistake or not, you can't<br />\nget out. No group of men now<br />\ninterested in athletics, no classes<br />\nnow, passing through Hopkins,<br />\nshould be unwise or unjust enough<br />\nto tie the hands of those who follow.<br />\nFurthermore, adopt the rule because undergraduate institutions<br />\nhave it and you must consistently<br />\napply it to all branches of athletics<br />\n\u2014track as well as football and baseball. Other undergraduate rules,<br />\nsuch as the one-year rule, will rise<br />\nto plague you and further limit<br />\nthe full exercise of your powers..<br />\nSuch faults as now exist are purely coaching rule defects. Every<br />\nundergraduate 'and graduate student should stand on precisely the<br />\nsame footing\u2014with the same responsibilities, the same training<br />\nrules, the same opportunities\u2014this<br />\nis the correct sporting spirit.

In 1907<br />\nHopkins played the smaller colleges and local teams, and won one<br />\ngame out of seven (tying one);<br />\nin 1911, with the stiffest schedule<br />\never tackled, we won four (really<br />\nfive) out of nine games; in 1910<br />\nwe did even better, losing only to<br />\nStevens and the Carlisle Indians.<br />\nIn 1911 the receipts from games<br />\nindicate that the season's attendance was probably six times that<br />\nof 1907. We do not want any<br />\nretrogressive policy.<br />\nThere are certain conditions that<br />\ncan be, and should be, improved<br />\nupon, to give a more even chance<br />\nto all candidates.

U.,<br />\nand for many years the delegate<br />\nfrom the Intercollegiate Athletic<br />\nAssociation. Mr. Kirby is careful<br />\nto indicate that the letter expresses<br />\nonly his personal opinion:<br />\n\"Coming to the so-called fouryear rule, I personally see no reason why Johns Hopkins should debar a great many of its students<br />\nwho desire to take part in sport<br />\nfrom so doing, eielier by reason of<br />\nthe four-year rule or the one-year<br />\nrule. Athletic competition is, after<br />\nall, only a means of recreation;<br />\nand, more important than this, only<br />\nthe means to an end and not the<br />\nend itself; and when we find a<br /><br />\n3<br />\nuniversity with the high ideals of<br />\nJohns Hopkins, and with other universities willing to compete with its<br />\nstudents, be they graduates of other<br />\nuniversities or not, I personally<br />\ncan see no reason why any, who are<br />\nscholastically eligible, should not be<br />\npermitted to continue their athletic careers.\"<br />\n=111=1111\u2022111=1.11<br />\nWalter Vincent Johnson.<br /><br />\nWalter V lucent Johnson, A.
