Thus,<br />\ncontrary to the dark predictions of last fall that noone who<br />\nwithheld his first semester grades would ever get into medical<br />\nschool seem somewhat extreme.<br />\nUnfortunately, when the entire grading matter came up<br />\nlast fall, decisions were made and positions were stated, but<br />\nno one had any idea what the situation really was. Neither<br />\nthe Dean's office nor students involved in the controversy<br />\nmade any systematic effort to find out how much the<br />\nabsence of a student's first semester grades would actually<br />\naffect his chances of getting into a graduate school.<br />\nOne member of the subcommittee said of the study<br />\nresults, \"The responses could be read either way,\" and<br />\nanother member stated, \"They were vague and indecisive.\" If<br />\nanyone had bothered to ask graduate schools last semester,<br />\nall the bitterness and recrimination that took place could<br />\nhave been avoided. Next time a major issue hits the campus,<br />\nwe hope that the people involved, both administrators and<br />\nstudents, will make an effort to find out what the facts of the<br />\nmatter are, instead of becoming arouseds and making<br />\ndecisions without having any idea what is really going on.<br />\n<br />\nBy CHARLES PINNING<br />\nAs their first production of<br />\n1974, the Barnstormers have<br />\nchosen to stage the classic Ibsen<br />\nplay Hedda Gabler. Technically,<br />\nthe show is very clean, the work is<br />\nconsistent and the cast under the<br />\ndirection of Alan Wade, who is<br />\nassociated with Center Stage, is<br />\nwell disciplined. Unlike most<br />\ncollege productions, they have<br />\nsurmounted the problems of<br />\ndropping lines and awkward<br />\nblocking. At times, however, this<br />\nparticular production obscures the<br />\nstory within lbsen's Play, to the<br />\npoint where much of the action<br />\nlo ses its credibility.<br />\nIn his script, Ibsen gives us the<br />\nstory of a woman who has been<br />\ndealt, fate's most severe blow: a<br />\nlife without purpose. Hedda is the<br />\ndaughter of the late General<br />\nGabler. It is implicit in the story<br />\nthat, as Hedda grew up, her father<br />\npaved a smooth road for her,<br />\nremoving all obstacles and<br />\nsupplying her with all of the<br />\nmaterial needs she desired<br />\nPerhaps he had led an exciting<br />\nlife, rich with dangerous and<br />\nexciting adventures, but we can be<br />\nassured that all Hedda was allowed<br />\nto know of pain, risk and<br />\nadventure were the stories he<br />\nwould relate to her. Because she<br />\nwas a female and his daughter, she<br />\nwas sheltered from all<br />\ninconvenience and pain and any<br />\n<br />\nletters to the editor<br />\nTo the Editor:<br />\nI would like to comment on the<br />\nemotional atmosphere provided by<br />\nthis school. I feel that it is one that<br />\nis unfortunate and in need of<br />\nchange.<br />\nThe freshman situation is the<br />\nmost evident of this problem, and<br />\nthe one with which I have the most<br />\ncontact. In this instance, pressures<br />\nare close at hand and hard to<br />\navoid. Students, forced out of<br />\nfrustation, have resorted to acts of<br />\nviolence and immaturity, which I<br />\nbelieve would not have occured<br />\nunder more normal circumstances.<br />\n..<br />\nThe unusual' ptessutes of this<br />\n<br />\nMoscow or Peking or Havana is<br />\n<br />\ngood. It's fine when the rights of<br />\nthe people are abridged by<br />\nAllende, but when a military junta<br />\ndoes it, all hell breaks loose. The<br />\nleftist mind salivates over Mao what's a few million people more<br />\nor less, and after all he was hard at<br />\nwork on his writings and probably<br />\ndidn't notice all those purges and then goes positively paranoid<br />\nat the very mention of words like<br />\n\"rightwing\" and \"military\" except when the military is<br />\nGolda's, that is.<br />\nI've known Gary Green<br />\npersonal% for four years. Being the<br />\n<br />\nand increase the offernings. If<br />\n\"fly-by-night\" credit courses exist<br />\nthen the department and the<br />\nprofessor should be criticized, not<br />\nthe students who are taking the<br />\ncourse. Thus the burden of<br />\nresponsibility is on the faculty, and<br />\nif they vote to drop the<br />\nminimester, then, as some say,<br />\nthey are \"copping out.\"<br />\nCertainly no one will be hurt by<br />\na stronger minimester, for the<br />\nfaculty will be teaching and<br />\nstudents will be learning, and that's<br />\nsupposed to be what it's all about.<br />\nRight?...<br />\n<br />\nne y are<br />\n<br />\nTflTW<br />\n<br />\nu ins<br />\n<br />\npressures to which I refer are those idealism - oh how I tried!- but he<br />\n<br />\ncaused by inter-student relations.<br />\nStudents motivated by the<br />\ndesire to succeed have become<br />\nsel f-centered. Friendship is<br />\nabandoned for competition. I<br />\nspeak not of a healthy competitive<br />\nspirit, but of a blind competition<br />\nto get ahead, regardless of the<br />\neffects on your peers.<br />\nThose that suffer have found<br />\nthat life for them means more than<br />\na 4.0 grade average, more than<br />\nnightly discussions on Chemistry.<br />\nWhat does a diploma from the<br />\nuniversity mean ii its recipients are<br />\ncapable of dealing with the world<br />\nin only a dollar and cents manner?<br />\nDoctors and lawyers who are<br />\nperfected in the skills of their<br />\ntrade, but have no mechanisms for<br />\ndealing with their clients on a<br />\npersonal level are worthless.<br />\nI will not criticize without<br />\noffering suggestions. Perhaps the<br />\nschool should re-evaluate its<br />\nadmissions policy. A more even<br />\ndistribution of majors on a large<br />\nscale would help. If this is not<br />\nfeasible, because of the internal<br />\nstructure of the school, then at<br />\nleast make prospective students<br />\naware of what they will be facing.<br />\nA student written letter could be<br />\nsent to applicants advising them of<br />\nwhat they will be up against.<br />\nRegardless, something must be<br />\ndone.<br />\nI hope this plea will not be<br />\nignored. If no remedy is found, I<br />\nfear for this university and its<br />\ngraduates.<br />\nLeah Seidenfeld<br />\n<br />\nTo the Editor:<br />\nThe letter by Feinberg shows<br />\nthe typical leftist ivory-tower<br />\n\"Ubermensch\" mentality at work<br />\nagain: don't bother with such<br />\nbourgeois things as logic and<br />\nrefuting arguments, just throw the<br />\nusual propaganda pharases and<br />\nhope everybody's too snowed to<br />\nnotice. When he gets done with his<br />\ncould be's and could also's and<br />\nmight wonderings and might<br />\nquestionings, we get down to the<br />\nnitty-gritty, which is the simplistic<br />\nequation of fascism with<br />\ngovernment by the military, a<br />\ndubious assumption at best. For<br />\nleftists such as Feinberg, the<br />\ndouble standard runs rampant on a<br />\nfield of hypocrisy: a dictatorship<br />\nrun by the local military is bad, a<br />\ndictatorship manipulated by<br />\n<br />\nwent to Chile even more<br />\nentrenched in it than ever. It is<br />\nabsolutely inconceivable to me<br />\ntherefore, that the man is a)lying,<br />\nb) a mental incompetent, c) an<br />\nideological turncoat within two<br />\nmonths, or d) having a rifle<br />\npointed at his head as he writes.<br />\nTherefore, the only conclusion one<br />\ncan make - an incredible one, I<br />\nadmit! - is that Feinberg, never<br />\nhaving been to Chile, just doesn't<br />\nknow the score. Unless, of course<br />\nhe's been there under secret orders<br />\nfrom Hanoi Jane and I've just<br />\nblown his cover. Sorry about that,<br />\nJoel.<br />\nIf this is the best example of<br />\nNew-Old Left reasoning, what's a<br />\nyouthful idealist like me got left to<br />\nbelieve in?<br />\nDick Oles<br />\nTo the Editor:<br />\nI read with a great deal of<br />\ninterest your article and editorial<br />\nabout the possibility of ending<br />\nintersession in Friday's<br />\nNews-Letter. In particular I noted<br />\nwith interest the quotes of Dr.<br />\nJoseph Sampson. While I do not<br />\nknow this distinguished gentleman,<br />\nmust take exception to some of<br />\nhis ideas about the nature of Johns<br />\nHopkins. Even if many of our<br />\nstudents do go on to do graduate<br />\nwork, should this be any reason for<br />\npart of our faculty not to have the<br />\ndesire to teach and work with<br />\nstudents as undergraduates?<br />\nThe university exists for<br />\nstudents, and faculty should meet<br />\ntheir needs, as well as those in their<br />\nown professional disciplines. If<br />\nnot, let's just turn Homewood into<br />\na research center and forget about<br />\nteaching! I believe those faculty<br />\nmembers who are supposed to<br />\nwork with undergraduates and<br />\ndon't, are cheating the students<br />\nwho pay a good share of their<br />\nsalaries (something many faculty<br />\nmembers forget all too easily).<br />\nOur students have expressed<br />\ngreat deal of interest and<br />\nenthusiasm for the minimester<br />\nconcept. But what haver several<br />\ndepartments done? Little or<br />\nnothing. Departments should offer<br />\ncourses, it's that simple. If the<br />\nattendance is very poor or<br />\nnon-existant, then drop it -- but at<br />\nleast try to offer something.<br />\nPerhaps my view is just too<br />\nsimple, or maybe too darn honest,<br />\nbut let's keep minimester credit<br />\n<br />\nsituations that might bring on<br />\nthese conditions. From birth,<br />\nHedda settles complacently into a<br />\nvicarious life. She becomes a<br />\nvoyeur.<br />\nThe most vivid recollection Miss<br />\nTesman has of Hedda as a child is<br />\n\"riding with her father\"... wearing<br />\na \"long, black riding outfit.\"<br />\nHedda Gabler as child/corpse.<br />\nHedda is physically beautiful both<br />\nas a child and as a woman, but has<br />\na bad trait: envy. She has the<br />\ndesire both as a child and as a<br />\nwoman to burn the hair of a fellow<br />\nschoolmate because it is more<br />\nbeautiful than her own. This shell<br />\nof a person becomes dangerous<br />\nbecause she has been irrevocably<br />\nsocialized into an eternally<br />\nfrustrated life and has turned her<br />\nenergies to the task of<br />\nmanipulating other lives as she has<br />\nno idea of what to do with her<br />\nown.<br />\nShe marries George Tesman, an<br />\nacademic who spends most of his<br />\ntime doing research with the hopes<br />\nof publishing a book and thus<br />\nacquiring a professorship. She<br />\nmarries because it is convenient<br />\nand respectable and because her<br />\n\"time had come.\" Since their is<br />\nnothing inside of Hedda her life is<br />\nall important in terms of outward<br />\nappearances. Her marriage to<br />\nTesman is nothing but a superficial<br />\nmanifestation of what she believes<br />\nto be right. Her marriage is what<br />\nshe is: an appearance with nothing<br />\nbehind it. George marries Hedda<br />\nfor much the same reasons, but<br />\nunlike Hedda he has a life of his<br />\nown: his scholarly research.<br />\nAs the play progresses Eilert<br />\nLovborg surfaces. Prior to Hedda's<br />\nmarriage to Tesman, Lovborg was<br />\none of Hedda's numerous suitors.<br />\nHer favorite, in fact. Why then did<br />\nHedda not marry Lovborg?<br />\nBecause, despite his talents as a<br />\nwriter, he has a reputation as a<br />\ndebaucher. It would not have<br />\nlooked good for Hedda to have<br />\nmarried Lovborg.<br />\nThe play beings. Hedda and<br />\nTesman have just returned to their<br />\nnew villa after a honeymoon of<br />\nnearly six months the bulk of<br />\nwhich Tesman spent doing research<br />\nin various European libraries and<br />\nHedda spent sitting alone in hotel<br />\nrooms or acquiring new dresses.<br />\nMCI<br />\n<br />\no<br />\n<br />\nuy<br />\nje<br />\n<br />\nesiianS<br />\n<br />\nIllb<br />\n<br />\nIn case those of you who smoke<br />\npot haven't realized, pot has a very<br />\nstrong odor.

Not if you consider the<br />\nspecifics.<br />\nTake the problem of graduate medical education. It's a period of your life the Air Force can make<br />\nconsiderably easier with comfortable salary and living conditions.<br />\nCreature comforts aside, the Air Force offers<br />\nprofessional advantages. Besides receiving training<br />\nin your own specialty, you'd be in contact with<br />\nphysicians in all of the medical specialties. You'll<br />\nfunction in an environment which is intellectually<br />\nstimulating and professionally challenging.<br />\nNot all physicians pursue post residency fellowships. But if you are interested, the Air Force conducts them both in-house and at civilian institutions.<br />\nThe physician already in practice can look forward to other things. If you want training in the<br />\npractice of the medicine of the future, you'll find it<br />\nin the Air Force. For example, there's emphasis on<br />\ngroup medicine and preventive medicine, and the<br />\ngrowing specialty of \"family physician.\" Whatever<br />\nyour interest, there are few specialties which are not<br />\nbeing practiced in today's Air Force.<br />\nThe physician starting his practice in civilian<br />\nlife has to take into account the cost of setting up an<br />\noffice. The physician commencing his -practice in<br />\n<br />\nthe Air Force does not. He finds his office established<br />\nfor him. Supplies and equipment readily available.<br />\nHe has many options available to him when treating<br />\npatients. For example,he can consult with Air Force<br />\nspecialists. He also has referral to other Air Force<br />\nfacilities via aeromedical evacuation.

The contest resulted in a<br />\nmoral victory for the Jays, who<br />\nplayed excellent ball against a<br />\nheavily favored foe, but this fact<br />\nprovided little solace for a squad<br />\nattempting to tie the school<br />\nmark for consecutive wins.<br />\nHopkins came out firing in the<br />\nfirst half, running a bit more than<br />\ntheir patterned offense usually<br />\nallows. Shooting at a better than<br />\n50% clip, the Jays seemed to<br />\nsurprise even themselves by<br />\nkeeping up with their hosts.<br />\nGradually gaining confidence, the<br />\n<br />\nJays handcuffed Drexel's leading<br />\nscorers while Bobby Freedman<br />\nand Greg DeLong bombed away<br />\nfrom the fringes. The Dragons<br />\nmissed 12 consecutive shots at<br />\none point- while Freedman rifled<br />\nhome five in a row, resulting in a<br />\nBlue Jay lead of 32-22. A pair of<br />\ncold spells by the Jays were<br />\nnegated in the closing minutes by<br />\nthe Birds' excellent defense and<br />\nHopkins owned a 34-26 edge at<br />\nhalftime.<br />\nDrexel had nowhere to go but<br />\nup in the second half, realizing<br />\ntheir College Division opponent<br />\nwas not to be taken lightly. It fell<br />\nupon the shoulders of 6-3 guard<br />\nGreg Newman to make things<br />\n<br />\nNEws-krret<br />\n<br />\nhappen for the Dragons. The<br />\nsenior co-captain had destroyed<br />\nthe Blue Jays at Homewood last<br />\nseason with an 18 point, 10<br />\nrebound outburst, but had been<br />\nless a factor in the rematch to<br />\nthis point. Newman found his<br />\noutside shot once again in the<br />\nopening minutes of the second<br />\nstanza, however and the Dragons<br />\nwere back in the game.<br />\nThe Jays maintained their<br />\n10-point lead throughout<br />\nNewman's opening barrage with<br />\nsome sharpshooting on the part<br />\nof Greg DeLong, but Newman,<br />\nwith the help of a little<br />\nprotection from .the men in<br />\nstriped shirts, found additional<br />\n<br />\nsports<br />\n<br />\nSwimmers defeat LaSalle, 58-55<br />\nBy STEVEN LEVIN<br />\nThe LaSalle Explorers were<br />\nthe victims when the Hopkins<br />\nSwimmers travelled to<br />\nPhiladelphia and came away with<br />\na 58-55 victory Saturday.<br />\nHowever, it seemed that the Jays<br />\nwere the real \"Explorers\" since it<br />\n/<br />\n2 hours to<br />\ntook the team bus 41<br />\nventure from Homewood to<br />\nPhiladelphia.<br />\nScheduled to start at 3:00, the<br />\nmeet finally got underway at<br />\n4:00 and the Comforteers, tired<br />\nfrom the long bus ride, took to<br />\nthe water in what was to be one<br />\nof the closest meets in \u2022 Coach<br />\nComfort's 5 years at Hopkins.<br />\nThe Jays started the meet off<br />\nwith a splash, as their best relay<br />\nteam, Horning, Stoever, Milne<br />\nand Patzschke, won the 400 yd.<br />\n<br />\nmedley relay in 3:40.116. But<br />\nthe order of finish in the next<br />\nevent, the 1000 yd. freestyle, set<br />\nthe tone for the rest of the meet.<br />\nEric Engelmann won it in<br />\n10:24.61 but LaSalle took 2nd<br />\nand 3rd place. This pattern<br />\ncontinued throughout the meet<br />\nas Stoever's victories in the 200<br />\nyd. individual medlye and 200<br />\nyd. breaststroke, Patzschke's win<br />\nin the 100 yd. freestyle,<br />\nHorning's triumph in the 200 yd.<br />\nbackstroke and Milne's rout in<br />\nthe 500 yd. freestyle; all found<br />\nHopkins taking 1st while losing<br />\n2nd and 3rd.<br />\nSweet Revenge<br />\nThough there were no record<br />\nbreaking performances, the Jays<br />\nwere led by 3 double winners:<br />\nMilne, Stoever and Patzschke.<br />\n<br />\nAlso Fred Rudolph's<br />\ncome-from -behind 2nd place<br />\nfinish in the 200 yd. butterfly<br />\nand Marc Tohir's 2nd in the 3<br />\nmeter divingswere the highlights<br />\nof the competition.<br />\nThere was almost a first in so<br />\nfar as Hopkins swimming goes.<br />\nBut, for lack of a bathing suit,<br />\nBlue Jay fresh(man?) mermaid,<br />\nRoxanne Miller, missed her first<br />\ntry in varsity competition.(None<br />\nof the guys even offered to lend<br />\nher a suit; what kind of team<br />\nspirit is that??) Well, maybe next<br />\nmeet. The next meet for the<br />\nComforteers is Saturday,<br />\nFebruary 9, at home against<br />\nanother NCAA University<br />\ndivision opponent: Westchester<br />\nState (Pa.).

His efforts,<br />\nwhich earlier had produced<br />\noffensive fouls, now resulted in<br />\nthree-point plays and two-shot<br />\nopportunities.<br />\nIlopkins adjusted to the<br />\nincreased mayhem by turning the<br />\nother cheek, preferring to set up<br />\nfor the open shot rather than run<br />\nthe risk of incurring additional<br />\nfouls. Drexel took this<br />\nopportunity to hold the Jays<br />\nscoreless for six minutes and<br />\nforty seconds, reducing an<br />\neight-point Hopkins lead to a tie<br />\nat 51. Bill Jews broke the spell<br />\nwith 2:35 remaining, but the<br />\npersistent Newman hit twice<br />\nmore to give the Dragons a<br />\ntwo-point lead. Greg DeLong's<br />\njumper from 15 feet tied the<br />\ngame for the last time, and with<br />\n1:10 to go, the Dragons seemed<br />\nwell in command.<br />\nDrexel brought the ball down<br />\ndeliberately, then suddenly<br />\nstepped up the tempo, hopking<br />\nto pick up another three-point<br />\ngift from the officials. Alas, the<br />\nDragons had not counted on the<br />\ninconsistency of referee Joe<br />\nVanak, whose astigmatism<br />\nimproved sufficiently to whistle<br />\nDragons' center Terry Parks for a<br />\npersonal with thirty-seven<br />\nseconds remaining.

He ran<br />\nhis dual meet record to 7-1 when<br />\nhe took a 10-2 decison from<br />\nTowson's Dave Wittenburg.<br />\nLazzaro was stalemated on his<br />\nfeet in the first period, but an<br />\nescape and take down in the<br />\nsecond period gave him a 3-0<br />\nedge going into the final period.<br />\nLazzaro then turned Wittenburg<br />\ntwice with the head and ribs<br />\ncradle en route to victory.<br />\nThe Dynamic Duo found the<br />\ngoing rough during the past week<br />\nas both Ron Pucillo and Mike<br />\nPrivitera dropped decisions<br />\nagainst their American and<br />\nTowson State opponents. Pucillo<br />\nfaced Ed Garono of Towson<br />\nState. Garono was last year's<br />\nMason-Dixon champion for the<br />\nTigers.<br />\nHopkins had one shut out in<br />\nthe Towson State match. It was<br />\nClark Kingery at 142 pounds<br />\nblanking Larry Lidard by the<br />\nscore of 5-0 Kingery was good<br />\non his feet but Lidard refused to<br />\ngive Kingery the takedown.<br />\nKingery rode out Lidard superbly<br />\nin the second period. Going into<br />\nthe third period, the match was<br />\n<br />\nscoreless But Clark turned things<br />\naround as he reversed Lidard<br />\nearly in the third period. Kingery<br />\nthen turned Lidard to his back<br />\nfor a near fall and was awarded<br />\none point for riding time, giving<br />\nhim a well-deserved 5-0 shutout.<br />\nSpace Cowboy<br />\nHad Hopkins turned the 2<br />\nsingle point losses into victories,<br />\nthe final score Saturday would<br />\nhave been 18-16 in favor of the<br />\nBlue Jays.<br />\n<br />\nAgain a little overanxious play<br />\nspelled defeat when DeLong<br />\npassed inside with 22 seconds<br />\nleft. The ubiquitious Newman<br />\nreached in to make the steal,<br />\nthen pumped the ball home from<br />\ntwenty feet with three seconds<br />\nshowing to ice the contest.<br />\nThe game was a bitter loss for<br />\nCoach Gary Rupert. who felt his<br />\nteam played a \"near-flawless<br />\ngame.\" The Jays outshot the<br />\nDragons from the floor by eight<br />\npoints, yet managed 5 of 6 from<br />\nthe line to Drexel's 15 of 15.<br />\nAlthough Hopkins lost the battle<br />\nof the boards 34-32 they held<br />\ntheir own against a much more<br />\nphysical squad.<br />\nThe loss drops Hopkins to a<br />\n10-6 record, but does not affect<br />\ntheir 6-1 conference mark.

Technically,<br />\nthe show is very clean, the work is<br />\nconsistent and the cast under the<br />\ndirection of Alan Wade, who is<br />\nassociated with Center Stage, is<br />\nwell disciplined. Unlike most<br />\ncollege productions, they have<br />\nsurmounted the problems of<br />\ndropping lines and awkward<br />\nblocking. At times, however, this<br />\nparticular production obscures the<br />\nstory within lbsen's Play, to the<br />\npoint where much of the action<br />\nlo ses its credibility.<br />\nIn his script, Ibsen gives us the<br />\nstory of a woman who has been<br />\ndealt, fate's most severe blow: a<br />\nlife without purpose. Hedda is the<br />\ndaughter of the late General<br />\nGabler. It is implicit in the story<br />\nthat, as Hedda grew up, her father<br />\npaved a smooth road for her,<br />\nremoving all obstacles and<br />\nsupplying her with all of the<br />\nmaterial needs she desired<br />\nPerhaps he had led an exciting<br />\nlife, rich with dangerous and<br />\nexciting adventures, but we can be<br />\nassured that all Hedda was allowed<br />\nto know of pain, risk and<br />\nadventure were the stories he<br />\nwould relate to her. Because she<br />\nwas a female and his daughter, she<br />\nwas sheltered from all<br />\ninconvenience and pain and any<br /><br />\nletters to the editor<br />\nTo the Editor:<br />\nI would like to comment on the<br />\nemotional atmosphere provided by<br />\nthis school.

In this instance, pressures<br />\nare close at hand and hard to<br />\navoid.

If<br />\nnot, let's just turn Homewood into<br />\na research center and forget about<br />\nteaching! I believe those faculty<br />\nmembers who are supposed to<br />\nwork with undergraduates and<br />\ndon't, are cheating the students<br />\nwho pay a good share of their<br />\nsalaries (something many faculty<br />\nmembers forget all too easily).<br />\nOur students have expressed<br />\ngreat deal of interest and<br />\nenthusiasm for the minimester<br />\nconcept.

She has the<br />\ndesire both as a child and as a<br />\nwoman to burn the hair of a fellow<br />\nschoolmate because it is more<br />\nbeautiful than her own. This shell<br />\nof a person becomes dangerous<br />\nbecause she has been irrevocably<br />\nsocialized into an eternally<br />\nfrustrated life and has turned her<br />\nenergies to the task of<br />\nmanipulating other lives as she has<br />\nno idea of what to do with her<br />\nown.<br />\nShe marries George Tesman, an<br />\nacademic who spends most of his<br />\ntime doing research with the hopes<br />\nof publishing a book and thus<br />\nacquiring a professorship. She<br />\nmarries because it is convenient<br />\nand respectable and because her<br />\n\"time had come.\" Since their is<br />\nnothing inside of Hedda her life is<br />\nall important in terms of outward<br />\nappearances. Her marriage to<br />\nTesman is nothing but a superficial<br />\nmanifestation of what she believes<br />\nto be right.

If<br />\nonly the director could let us see<br />\nthe Consumate agony of anomie<br />\non her face as she looks out the<br />\nwindows into the blue instead .<br />\nhaving her turn her full back to us<br />\nand have her appear as a plotting<br />\nschemer. She also throws away<br />\nseveral important lines, most<br />\nnotably in the last scene where in a<br />\nfinal effort she approaches Tesman<br />\nand asks, \"Is there nothing I can<br />\ndo to make myself useful?\" and he<br />\ndismisses her by saying,\"NO, not a<br />\nthing.\" This is the story of Hedda's<br />\nlife. As she was probably shunted<br />\noff by her father so she is now by<br />\nher husband.<br />\nThis production allows us to feel<br />\nno sympathy for Hedda. It simply<br />\ncreates a somewhat sinister bitch<br />\nsho shoots herself and we're glad<br />\nthat she does. In the end Hedda<br />\nasks that question she must have<br />\nasked as a little girl and again is<br />\nrejected.<br />\nSo she goes into the back room<br />\nand bangs on the piano for<br />\nattention and is reproached.

Not if you consider the<br />\nspecifics.<br />\nTake the problem of graduate medical education. It's a period of your life the Air Force can make<br />\nconsiderably easier with comfortable salary and living conditions.<br />\nCreature comforts aside, the Air Force offers<br />\nprofessional advantages. Besides receiving training<br />\nin your own specialty, you'd be in contact with<br />\nphysicians in all of the medical specialties. You'll<br />\nfunction in an environment which is intellectually<br />\nstimulating and professionally challenging.<br />\nNot all physicians pursue post residency fellowships. But if you are interested, the Air Force conducts them both in-house and at civilian institutions.<br />\nThe physician already in practice can look forward to other things. If you want training in the<br />\npractice of the medicine of the future, you'll find it<br />\nin the Air Force. For example, there's emphasis on<br />\ngroup medicine and preventive medicine, and the<br />\ngrowing specialty of \"family physician.\" Whatever<br />\nyour interest, there are few specialties which are not<br />\nbeing practiced in today's Air Force.<br />\nThe physician starting his practice in civilian<br />\nlife has to take into account the cost of setting up an<br />\noffice. The physician commencing his -practice in<br /><br />\nthe Air Force does not. He finds his office established<br />\nfor him. Supplies and equipment readily available.<br />\nHe has many options available to him when treating<br />\npatients. For example,he can consult with Air Force<br />\nspecialists.

The contest resulted in a<br />\nmoral victory for the Jays, who<br />\nplayed excellent ball against a<br />\nheavily favored foe, but this fact<br />\nprovided little solace for a squad<br />\nattempting to tie the school<br />\nmark for consecutive wins.<br />\nHopkins came out firing in the<br />\nfirst half, running a bit more than<br />\ntheir patterned offense usually<br />\nallows. Shooting at a better than<br />\n50% clip, the Jays seemed to<br />\nsurprise even themselves by<br />\nkeeping up with their hosts.<br />\nGradually gaining confidence, the<br /><br />\nJays handcuffed Drexel's leading<br />\nscorers while Bobby Freedman<br />\nand Greg DeLong bombed away<br />\nfrom the fringes. The Dragons<br />\nmissed 12 consecutive shots at<br />\none point- while Freedman rifled<br />\nhome five in a row, resulting in a<br />\nBlue Jay lead of 32-22. A pair of<br />\ncold spells by the Jays were<br />\nnegated in the closing minutes by<br />\nthe Birds' excellent defense and<br />\nHopkins owned a 34-26 edge at<br />\nhalftime.<br />\nDrexel had nowhere to go but<br />\nup in the second half, realizing<br />\ntheir College Division opponent<br />\nwas not to be taken lightly. It fell<br />\nupon the shoulders of 6-3 guard<br />\nGreg Newman to make things<br /><br />\nNEws-krret<br /><br />\nhappen for the Dragons. The<br />\nsenior co-captain had destroyed<br />\nthe Blue Jays at Homewood last<br />\nseason with an 18 point, 10<br />\nrebound outburst, but had been<br />\nless a factor in the rematch to<br />\nthis point.

Well, maybe next<br />\nmeet. The next meet for the<br />\nComforteers is Saturday,<br />\nFebruary 9, at home against<br />\nanother NCAA University<br />\ndivision opponent: Westchester<br />\nState (Pa.).

His efforts,<br />\nwhich earlier had produced<br />\noffensive fouls, now resulted in<br />\nthree-point plays and two-shot<br />\nopportunities.<br />\nIlopkins adjusted to the<br />\nincreased mayhem by turning the<br />\nother cheek, preferring to set up<br />\nfor the open shot rather than run<br />\nthe risk of incurring additional<br />\nfouls. Drexel took this<br />\nopportunity to hold the Jays<br />\nscoreless for six minutes and<br />\nforty seconds, reducing an<br />\neight-point Hopkins lead to a tie<br />\nat 51. Bill Jews broke the spell<br />\nwith 2:35 remaining, but the<br />\npersistent Newman hit twice<br />\nmore to give the Dragons a<br />\ntwo-point lead. Greg DeLong's<br />\njumper from 15 feet tied the<br />\ngame for the last time, and with<br />\n1:10 to go, the Dragons seemed<br />\nwell in command.<br />\nDrexel brought the ball down<br />\ndeliberately, then suddenly<br />\nstepped up the tempo, hopking<br />\nto pick up another three-point<br />\ngift from the officials. Alas, the<br />\nDragons had not counted on the<br />\ninconsistency of referee Joe<br />\nVanak, whose astigmatism<br />\nimproved sufficiently to whistle<br />\nDragons' center Terry Parks for a<br />\npersonal with thirty-seven<br />\nseconds remaining.

He ran<br />\nhis dual meet record to 7-1 when<br />\nhe took a 10-2 decison from<br />\nTowson's Dave Wittenburg.<br />\nLazzaro was stalemated on his<br />\nfeet in the first period, but an<br />\nescape and take down in the<br />\nsecond period gave him a 3-0<br />\nedge going into the final period.<br />\nLazzaro then turned Wittenburg<br />\ntwice with the head and ribs<br />\ncradle en route to victory.<br />\nThe Dynamic Duo found the<br />\ngoing rough during the past week<br />\nas both Ron Pucillo and Mike<br />\nPrivitera dropped decisions<br />\nagainst their American and<br />\nTowson State opponents.

It was<br />\nClark Kingery at 142 pounds<br />\nblanking Larry Lidard by the<br />\nscore of 5-0 Kingery was good<br />\non his feet but Lidard refused to<br />\ngive Kingery the takedown.<br />\nKingery rode out Lidard superbly<br />\nin the second period. Going into<br />\nthe third period, the match was<br /><br />\nscoreless But Clark turned things<br />\naround as he reversed Lidard<br />\nearly in the third period.
