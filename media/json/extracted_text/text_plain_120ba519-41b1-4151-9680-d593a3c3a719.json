One hundred plus<br />\nstudents gathered in the lobby of<br />\nthe Milton S. Eisenhower Library<br />\nto protest the complete absence of<br />\nstudent involvement in the formulation of the new Five-Year<br />\nPlan, as well as the lack of a<br />\nmechanism for student input in<br />\nthe plan's implementation. What<br />\nis significant about this student<br />\nprotest is not the number of<br />\nstudents who participated\u2014<br />\nclearly only a small fraction of the<br />\nundergraduate population was<br />\ninvolved\u2014but rather the fact that<br />\nHopkins students took a vigorous<br />\nstance against the unilateralism of<br />\nthe administration's decisionmaking process.<br />\nThe Five-Year Plan was<br />\nunveiled publicly just as the fall<br />\nsemester was ending, at a time<br />\nwhen<br />\nthe<br />\nmajority<br />\nof<br />\nundergraduates had already<br />\ndeparted for the holidays.<br />\n<br />\nLETTERS, from 7<br />\nSciences faculty and increasing<br />\nthe undergraduate enrollment, the<br />\nadministration is compromising<br />\none of Hopkins' oldest traditions,<br />\ni.e. allowing undergraduates to<br />\nstudy in small seminars or independently with outstanding<br />\nscholars in a particular field.<br />\nAs a history major, I have<br />\nalready felt the effect of the Arts<br />\nand Sciences deficit.

Since the administration has<br />\nSee LETTERS, 9<br />\n<br />\nMoreover, at no time during the<br />\nprocess of the plan's preparation<br />\nwere any students consulted for<br />\ninput into the Five-Year Plan.<br />\nThe students, once presented with<br />\nthese basic facts, found them<br />\nquite difficult to swallow and<br />\ndecided to make a strong and<br />\nunambiguous statement of disapproval. To say the impact of the<br />\nprotest held ten days ago was<br />\nanything less than powerful is<br />\nthoroughly inaccurate.<br />\nThe undergraduates must be<br />\ngiven reason to believe that their<br />\nconcerns are viewed by the administration with the same<br />\nseriousness as the concerns of<br />\nother members of the University<br />\ncommunity. To this point no such<br />\nreason has been provided and<br />\nnone seems forthcoming. It is my<br />\nhope that the students' unswerving commitment to positive<br />\nreform will be able to transcend<br />\nthe historical intransigence of the<br />\nadministration toward questions<br />\nimportant to the undergraduates.<br />\n<br />\nLet me emphasize that the<br />\nundergraduates recognize the importance of eradicating the Arts<br />\n& Sciences budget deficit and<br />\nsupport the administration's efforts to accomplish that objective.<br />\nFurthermore, it is widely<br />\nunderstood that economic austerity is not a desirable policy but<br />\noften a necessary one. What is<br />\nclearly wrong is that students<br />\nwere completely excluded from<br />\nthe process of charting a course<br />\nfor their university, a wrong further compounded by the<br />\nundeniable fact that major student<br />\ninterests will be directly\u2014and<br />\nnegatively\u2014impacted by the<br />\ncourse ultimately chosen.<br />\nIt is now the time to rectify this<br />\nsituation. The undergraduates<br />\nmust have a voice and a vote in<br />\ndecisionmaking pertaining to the<br />\nFive-Year Plan. Furthermore, the<br />\nadministration should take this<br />\nopportunity to reevaluate its position on dealing with the<br />\nundergraduates. A fundamental<br />\n<br />\nchange for the better is needed in<br />\nthis relationship and the timing is<br />\npropitious. Both sides must continue the dialogue that has begun<br />\nin an effort to open channels of<br />\ncommunication, foster a mutual<br />\nunderstanding and, most importantly, establish once and for all<br />\nthe importance of undergraduate<br />\neducation on this campus. To<br />\npursue any other course would be<br />\nan error.<br />\nThe protest was a watershed<br />\nevent, a clear indication that<br />\nHopkins students will not tolerate<br />\nhaving their core interests ignored.

Does that make Francis<br />\nan anti-semite? Not necessarily,<br />\nbut this brings us to two odd<br />\nfacts. Fact 2: CR Francis has yet<br />\nto offer any explanation of how<br />\nhe came to advocate Liddy as an<br />\nappropriate person to pair with<br />\nHoffman. Fact 3: Neither Francis apologists nor anybody else<br />\nhas addressed any of my actual<br />\ncharges against Francis and the<br />\nCR's.<br />\nFact 4: Despite this total<br />\nsilence, I believe it is time to tentatively set aside the question of<br />\nanti-semitism. Why? Because of<br />\ntwo further facts. Fact 5: I have<br />\nbeen assured both publicly and<br />\nprivately that Francis is not<br />\nwillfully anti-semitic. Fact 6:<br />\nWhile Francis has neither<br />\napologized for nor formally<br />\nwithdrawn his advocacy of Liddy, he has stopped repeating it.<br />\nGiven these two facts, I understand Francis' silence about Liddy as an admission that Liddy is<br />\nan inappropriate speaker for us.<br />\nGiven this, I am willing to trust<br />\nthat, in the words of David Lang,<br />\n\"Francis poses no immediate<br />\nthreat [to the Jews].\"<br />\nFact 7: My central charge<br />\nagainst the CR's continues to be<br />\nthat they are disingenuous.

The main<br />\norganizers spanned the Hopkins<br />\nwith<br />\nspectrum beginning<br />\nfreshmen, supported by upperclassmen. and organized with<br />\ngraduate students, and endorsed<br />\nby most faculty members. In fact,<br />\nall of the feedback I have received is that this sort of rally should<br />\nhave happened years ago. This<br />\nwas a rally where people of opposite political views and socioeconomic backgrounds came<br />\ntogether demanding the same<br />\ngoals.<br />\nThis 5-year plan effects every<br />\naspect of the Hopkins community. That the administration had<br />\nthe audacity to propose such a<br />\ndrastic plan (after categorically<br />\nignoring the students) shows<br />\neveryone the sincerity of our administrators.

Here at<br />\nJohns Hopkins, many groups<br />\norganized a number of events in<br />\nrecognition of Black History.<br />\nAlthough this year's programs<br />\nwere highly successful and<br />\nreceived a large turnout, many<br />\npeople feel that more needs to be<br />\ndone each year and that more of<br />\nthe Hopkins community must get<br />\ninvolved.<br />\nThe Black Student Union<br />\nscheduled one or two events each<br />\nweek, including an African Dinner at the Terrace Room, arranged<br />\nwith the help of Minority Affairs. Margo Butler kindled the<br />\ncafeteria's usual atmosphere and<br />\ndecor with the spirit of native<br />\nmusic from Cameron Africa,<br />\nposters featuring figures from<br />\ncolorful<br />\nHistory,<br />\nBlack<br />\nstreamers, and a video on the<br />\nHarlem Renaissance.<br />\nGabriel, a vendor of African<br />\nartifacts, was a special addition to<br />\nthe festivities. Daryl Price, cochair of the NAACP's education<br />\ncommittee, met Gabriel last year<br />\nselling his wares on the lower<br />\nquad, and listened to him recount<br />\nhis extensive travels through<br />\nmany different countries, including Ghana, Nigeria, Kenya,<br />\nand Saudi Arabia.<br />\nGabriel's tales about African<br />\nculture \"instilled fire\" in Price,<br />\ninspiring more than just pride.<br />\nPrice acquired a sense of \"knowing where [he] came from and<br />\nwhere [he was] going,\" knowing<br />\nthat he could trace his heritage<br />\nback to a \"land pf kings and<br />\n<br />\nqueens.\" Gabriel's travels, inspired by a curiosity about different peoples and cultures,<br />\nstimulated the same curiosity and<br />\ninquiry in many of his listeners.<br />\nThe BSU also showed a variety of movies, and sponsored a<br />\nperformance by the OLU dance<br />\ntroupe, an American school<br />\ntrained in native American dance.<br />\nRobert Johnson, sophomore, attended the performance and felt<br />\nit was entertaining and \"extremely well done.\" Johnson said that<br />\nthe troup encouraged audience<br />\nparticipation, making everyone<br />\nfeel \"like a part of what was going on.\"<br />\nPrice, who joined Johnson in<br />\nthe audience, felt drawn into a<br />\n\"cohesive unit\" and enjoyed being caught up in the novel realm<br />\nof African dance, music, and<br />\nculture.<br />\nThe dancers kicked off the performance with the ritual dance of<br />\nwelcome, and highlighted the<br />\nshow by explaining the<br />\nsignificance of various masks and<br />\ndemonstrating native African instruments such as the African<br />\nTalking Drum and the resonating<br />\nShakeray, which Price described<br />\nas a gourd in a netting of beads.<br />\nOne of the younger pupils, a little girl, surprised everyone by<br />\ngetting up and dancing for the audience.

During this era of new<br />\ndirections in art, literature,<br />\ndance, and poetry, black writers<br />\nsuch as Langston Hughes and<br />\nZora Neale Hurston rose in<br />\nprestige and overcame cultural<br />\nstereotypes. Johnson saw the film<br />\nand was inspired by those who<br />\npartook of the renaissance and<br />\nbecame \"more aware of their<br />\nsurroundings, taking control of<br />\nwhat was going on around them\"<br />\nand becoming great artists and<br />\nintellectuals.<br />\nThe NAACP also brought a<br />\nomw<br />\nrillealt<br />\n\"\"4<br />\n;0;<br />\n<br />\n4111111**<br />\n1101*.11110<br />\n<br />\n11,<br />\n\u2022<br />\n<br />\n11<br />\n<br />\neducation committee.<br />\nDaryl Price, co-chair of the NAACP's<br />\n<br />\nguest lecturer to campus, Professor Hudson, an expert on<br />\nAfrican-American art who taught<br />\nat JHU over the past intersession.<br />\nJohnson attended Professor Hudson's lecture and expressed an interest in establishing a permanent<br />\nplace for Hudson at Hopkins to<br />\nbegin to remedy the dire shortage<br />\nof black instructors here. During<br />\nthe lecture Hudson presented a<br />\nsynopsis of the diverse types of<br />\nAfrican and Afro-American art<br />\nand of the ways in which artists<br />\ncould be inspired.<br />\nJohnson found the subject matter new and exciting, and was inspired to learn more about<br />\nAfrican and Afro-American<br />\nhistory. Amazed at the number of<br />\nrenowned black artists, Johnson<br />\nsuddenly began to imagine how<br />\nmany reputable blacks there must<br />\nbe in other fields. Unfortunately,<br />\nthere are only a minimal number<br />\nof courses offered at Hopkins that<br />\npertain to African and AfroAmerican studies.<br />\nt.Programs were held by other<br />\ncampus organizations as well.<br />\nThe Hopkins Jewish League and<br />\nthe Black Student Union held a<br />\nforum that, according to Johnson,<br />\nwas a \"well-attended attempt to<br />\nimprove relations.\" Johnson was<br />\nalso pleasantly surprised to find<br />\nthe Chaplain's Office presenting<br />\nfilms such as Eyes on the Prize as<br />\na part of Black History Month.<br />\nJust last weekend, Black<br />\nHistory Month here at Hopkins<br />\nreached its peak with the music<br />\nof Ladysmith Black Mambazo,<br />\nfeaturing Smitty of Uganda. The<br />\ngroup, featured on Paul Simon's<br />\nGrace/and album, sang a cape/la<br />\nin their native tongue. Although<br />\nhe could not understand what the<br />\nwords meant, Price said \"the<br />\nsound was pleasing.\"<br />\n\"They didn't just stand<br />\nthere\u2014they marched and danced.<br />\nThey were really filled with<br />\nenergy,\" said Price. The rhythm<br />\nand harmony exhilarated the<br />\n<br />\ncrowd and, after three finales,<br />\nLadysmith received a standing<br />\novation. Price said that he found<br />\nthe performance of the African<br />\nNational Anthem especially moving, since it symbolized for him<br />\nthe struggle of the blacks in South<br />\nAfrica.<br />\nMost people felt that the month<br />\nhad been a great success.

The top eight<br />\ncandidates will compete in a run-off. After the<br />\nrun-off, Board members will interview the top<br />\nfive candidates and nominate one before the<br />\nBoard's April meeting.<br />\nThe twelve candidates include: Michael<br />\nReid Fenzel, Scott J.

If any writein candidate receives more than ten percent<br />\nof the vote for a position, however, a run-off<br />\nfor that position will be held.<br />\nBelow are Giangiulio's responses to several<br />\nquestions we posed relating to his candidacy<br />\nand to his views on current Hopkins issues.<br />\nOn the three following pages are excerpts<br />\nfrom information forms which the Young<br />\nTrustee candidates submitted a few weeks<br />\nago. The deadline for submission passed<br />\nbefore the Board of Trustees passed the FiveYear Plan.<br />\nThe information and statements have been<br />\nedited for style only slightly, and their content<br />\nhas not been changed.

John Misa took the photographs.<br />\n<br />\nLou<br />\n<br />\nGIANGIULIO<br />\n<br />\nAcademic Area: Economics<br />\nJHU Activities/Athletics: Student Council President,<br />\n1988-89; member, wrestling team; member, Blue Key<br />\nSociety; member, Phi Gamma Delta fraternity.<br />\nHobbies/Interests: Cycling, playing the accordion,<br />\ngoing to Hoppy Hours, FIJI Islander party.<br />\nWhat will be your top priority as<br />\nPresident?<br />\nMy top priority as President will continue to be to keep as many students as involved and informed about their school as<br />\npossible. This can be achieved through<br />\nopen forums, surveys, News-Letter op-eds,<br />\nand especially through the alreading existing standing committees of the Student<br />\nCouncil.<br />\nThe top priority of the Council as a<br />\nwhole should be to maintain a consistent<br />\nagenda of items so that work that was done<br />\nthis year and in the past can be followed<br />\nup on as long-term goals for the future.<br />\nThis can be done while addressing the<br />\neveryday concerns which invariably arise.<br />\nWhat do you think about the FiveYear Plan's content?<br />\nThe Five-Year Plan is a broad<br />\nframework to set all of the University's<br />\ndivisions, but especially Arts and Sciences,<br />\non solid financial ground. It calls for some<br />\nstrict measures in the School of Arts and<br />\nSciences to raise revenues and increase expenditures for which students and faculty<br />\ncannot but feel short-changed.<br />\nHowever, many people tend to forget<br />\nabout the provisions in the Plan which call<br />\n<br />\nfor large sums of money to come from<br />\nother divisions to aid Arts and Sciences,<br />\nwhich is perennially underendowed. This<br />\nis a landmark step for the University, and<br />\nif it leads to a more centralized structure<br />\nfor Johns Hopkins, this could be especially beneficial for undergraduates.<br />\nJust how this Five-Year Plan is interpreted will either make or break the<br />\nUniversity, in my opinion. My main concern is that students were not consulted<br />\nprevious to the Plan's release, and at present there is no mechanism for future student involvement. This input is crucial for<br />\na course of action which so directly affects<br />\nour quality of education.<br />\nHow ought students be involved in implementing the Plan? As president, how<br />\nwill you insure that involvement?<br />\nStudents out to be involved in both an<br />\nadvisory capacity to the Dean of Arts and<br />\nSciences and also at a decision-making<br />\nlevel in the implementation of the Plan.<br />\nThis is necessary since members of the advisory committee to the Dean could give<br />\ntheir overall status reports on departmental conditions for undergraduates and<br />\ngraduate students alike.<br />\nBut whether the Dean's office is<br />\n<br />\nallocated the resources needed to put these<br />\nrecommendations into effect is the consideration of a financial review group for<br />\nthe overseeing of the Five-Year Plan, on<br />\nwhich there should be student representation. As president I will work to insure this<br />\ninvolvement by meeting with Provost<br />\nLombardi, Dean Armstrong, and all concerned to tbster the type of discussion<br />\nneeded to create such student input.<br />\nI urge other students to become involved in the process by writing letters to<br />\nboth their Deans and the Provost with their<br />\nspecific concerns, as well as participating<br />\nresponsibly in all open forums of<br />\ndiscussion.<br />\nHas the Human Climate Task Force<br />\nReport been forgotten? How would you,<br />\nand can you implement its recommendations?<br />\nThe Human Climate Task Force Report<br />\naddressed a broad range of issues for concern on the Homewood campus and for the<br />\nmost part was right on target. Its recommendations should be used to guide the<br />\nlong-term planning of a consistent agenda<br />\nfor the Student Council in the near future,<br />\nsince most of the problems focus on issues<br />\nwhich are not readily resolved. But I would<br />\n<br />\nurge that the Student Council address these<br />\nitems one at a time, so as not to lose focus,<br />\nuntil some concrete resolution is found.<br />\nOnly in this fashion can real progress be<br />\nmade.<br />\nName two or three other issues that<br />\nyou plan to address in more detail next<br />\nyear.<br />\nI can foresee the Five-Year Plan and its<br />\nimplications involving a lot of the Council's time and efforts for next year.<br />\nHowever, I would like to see issues such<br />\nas the faculty advising structure in the<br />\nSchool of Arts and Sciences, an<br />\nundergraduate judicial board and honor<br />\nsystem, and the contracting and service<br />\naspects of the campus bookstore continue<br />\nto be addressed in detail.<br />\nI am especially interested in maintaining close contact with our alumni groups<br />\nto work on setting goals for long-term<br />\namenities. A major issue of importance<br />\nwhich should be addressed as soon as<br />\npossible is to establish student representation in the search process for the next<br />\npresident of the University. This will continue into the following year.<br />\n<br />\n\f14/M1ARCH<br />\n<br />\n1989<br />\n<br />\nYOUNG TRUSTEE '89<br />\nMichcol -R ic<br />\n<br />\nUjjal <umcr<br />\n<br />\nFENZEL<br />\n<br />\nGHOSHTAGORE<br />\n<br />\nOrganizations and Activities: Football (1-4)\u2014Captain 1988; Track 1; Vice<br />\nPresident (Junior Class); ROTC<br />\n(1-4)\u2014Ranger Commander (Cadet<br />\nMajor); Student Council Representative; University's Public Interest Investment Advisory Committee (3-4);<br />\nconducted Advanced Physical Training sessions three times a week (present); conduct and instruct classes on<br />\ntactics three times a week (present).<br />\nAcademic Area: Economics<br />\nOutside Activities: Sales Representative, W.R.

Although I realize that a<br />\nYoung Trustee's influence is limited, I<br />\nhope to fulfill the position's promise by<br />\nexpressing student concerns\u2014about<br />\nhousing, the 5-year plan, etc.\u2014to<br />\nJohns Hopkins' Trustees.<br />\nStudent facilities at Homewood, particularly housing, are seriously inadequate. The shortage of University<br />\nhousing keeps rents high and, more<br />\nimportantly, makes it difficult for upperclassmen to maintain a sense of<br />\ncommunity. In the competitive atmosphere which often prevails at<br />\nHopkins, such a sense of community<br />\nshould be encouraged, through the<br />\nthoughtful addition of new housing.<br />\nMany of us came here because of<br />\nsmall classes and Hopkins' reputation.<br />\nIf, as proposed, enrollment is raised<br />\nand faculty are not replaced, Hopkins'<br />\n<br />\nreputation will certainly decline, and<br />\nwe will be forever cheated. Instead,<br />\nthe University's structure should be<br />\ncentralized to allow its profit-making<br />\ndivisions to bear part of Homewood's<br />\ncosts. Effecting such a change will require convincing the Board that a topnotch undergraduate reputation does<br />\nhave significant value.<br />\nIf these issues concern you, I hope<br />\nyou will give me the chance to express<br />\nthem, as Young Trustee '89.<br />\n<br />\nScott J<br />\n<br />\n'Davi\u00b0 J.<br />\n<br />\nFITZGERALD<br />\n<br />\nGIARRACCO<br />\n<br />\nOrganizations and Activities: President of the Student Council; President<br />\nof the Senior Class; President of the<br />\nSophomore Class; President of the<br />\nDormitory Council; Chairman of the<br />\nEducation Committee; Member of the<br />\nVarsity Crew Team; Member of the<br />\nJunior Varsity Basketball Team;<br />\nMember of the Sailing Team; Cofounder and President of the Hopkins<br />\nHomeless Shelter Project; Member of<br />\nthe Delta Upsilon Fraternity.<br />\nAcademic Area: International<br />\nStudies<br />\nOutside Activities: Staff worker at<br />\nhomeless shelter; Nautilus Fitness instructor; Stack Assistant in Library;<br />\nCampus Posterer.<br />\nI plan to attend law school in either<br />\nWashington, D.C. or New York City.<br />\nStatement: During the past four<br />\nyears, it has been my pleasure to participate in a wide variety of extracurricular activities at Johns Hopkins.<br />\nFrom the Presidency ol the Student<br />\nCouncil to rowing varsity crew, from<br />\nbrotherhood in the Delta Upsilon<br />\nFraternity to being co-founder and current Director of the Hopkins Homeless<br />\nShelter Project, I have enjoyed a<br />\nbroad and rewarding collegiate experience. As a candidate for the office<br />\nof Young Trustee, I am called upon to<br />\nput forth the qualifications and<br />\nperspectives which make me the best<br />\nchoice for this important position. Yet,<br />\neven more importantly, I must present<br />\nthe reasons why I desire to be a<br />\nYoung Trustee.<br />\n<br />\nOur university faces a period of transition. From the deficit in the School of<br />\nArts and Sciences and the subsequent<br />\nintroduction of the Five-Year Plan, to<br />\nthe expansion of next year's freshman<br />\nclass and the implementation of a two<br />\ntiered system of tuition, important decisions are being made which will affect<br />\nall of us, as undergraduates, and even<br />\nas alumni. I feel that I have the experience and the proved dedication to<br />\naddress these issues from an informed and tested perspective.

At this<br />\npoint in time, it is even more apparent<br />\nthat responsible fiscal planning must<br />\nbe demanded of University officials.<br />\nSince my sophomore year I have<br />\nbeen directly involved in the \"recruitment\" of students, because I believe<br />\nthat The Johns Hopkins University is<br />\none of the better institutions where an<br />\neducation can be obtained. This includes all the aspects of an education.<br />\nDuring my four years here I, like many<br />\nof the other candidates, have<br />\ndeveloped a genuine love and appreciation of this school. I would like<br />\nto strengthen my connection with<br />\nJohns Hopkins by fulfilling the role of<br />\na Young Trustee.<br />\nThe position of Trustee would allow<br />\nme to be involved in the decision making that occurs within the administration. I would also influence the course<br />\n<br />\nthat Johns Hopkins will follow in the<br />\nfuture, and I know that I could effectively communicate the concerns and<br />\nphilosophies of Hopkins students.

Jay<br />\nCalkins, who is continuing to<br />\nprove himself as a proficient<br />\nsniper, also scored two goals in<br />\nthe first period. Kirby Perry continued the scoring spree, finding<br />\nthe upper corner on a penetrating<br />\nslapshot, followed by two quick<br />\ngoals from Dematos. Rounding<br />\nout the offensive barrage were<br />\nBill Marquardt, Pat Gibbons,<br />\nVinnie Alfi, and Mike Holmes.<br />\nAlso worth mentioning are goalie<br />\nDave Bowyer, who made some<br />\nkey saves at the beginning of the<br />\ngame, and Joe Zangara, whose<br />\ntransition to defense is improving<br />\nevery game.<br />\nThe Blue Jays' next games are<br />\nthis Thursday against U.

One hundred plus<br />\nstudents gathered in the lobby of<br />\nthe Milton S. Eisenhower Library<br />\nto protest the complete absence of<br />\nstudent involvement in the formulation of the new Five-Year<br />\nPlan, as well as the lack of a<br />\nmechanism for student input in<br />\nthe plan's implementation. What<br />\nis significant about this student<br />\nprotest is not the number of<br />\nstudents who participated\u2014<br />\nclearly only a small fraction of the<br />\nundergraduate population was<br />\ninvolved\u2014but rather the fact that<br />\nHopkins students took a vigorous<br />\nstance against the unilateralism of<br />\nthe administration's decisionmaking process.<br />\nThe Five-Year Plan was<br />\nunveiled publicly just as the fall<br />\nsemester was ending, at a time<br />\nwhen<br />\nthe<br />\nmajority<br />\nof<br />\nundergraduates had already<br />\ndeparted for the holidays.<br /><br />\nLETTERS, from 7<br />\nSciences faculty and increasing<br />\nthe undergraduate enrollment, the<br />\nadministration is compromising<br />\none of Hopkins' oldest traditions,<br />\ni.e. allowing undergraduates to<br />\nstudy in small seminars or independently with outstanding<br />\nscholars in a particular field.<br />\nAs a history major, I have<br />\nalready felt the effect of the Arts<br />\nand Sciences deficit.

To say the impact of the<br />\nprotest held ten days ago was<br />\nanything less than powerful is<br />\nthoroughly inaccurate.<br />\nThe undergraduates must be<br />\ngiven reason to believe that their<br />\nconcerns are viewed by the administration with the same<br />\nseriousness as the concerns of<br />\nother members of the University<br />\ncommunity. To this point no such<br />\nreason has been provided and<br />\nnone seems forthcoming. It is my<br />\nhope that the students' unswerving commitment to positive<br />\nreform will be able to transcend<br />\nthe historical intransigence of the<br />\nadministration toward questions<br />\nimportant to the undergraduates.<br /><br />\nLet me emphasize that the<br />\nundergraduates recognize the importance of eradicating the Arts<br />\n&amp; Sciences budget deficit and<br />\nsupport the administration's efforts to accomplish that objective.<br />\nFurthermore, it is widely<br />\nunderstood that economic austerity is not a desirable policy but<br />\noften a necessary one. What is<br />\nclearly wrong is that students<br />\nwere completely excluded from<br />\nthe process of charting a course<br />\nfor their university, a wrong further compounded by the<br />\nundeniable fact that major student<br />\ninterests will be directly\u2014and<br />\nnegatively\u2014impacted by the<br />\ncourse ultimately chosen.<br />\nIt is now the time to rectify this<br />\nsituation. The undergraduates<br />\nmust have a voice and a vote in<br />\ndecisionmaking pertaining to the<br />\nFive-Year Plan. Furthermore, the<br />\nadministration should take this<br />\nopportunity to reevaluate its position on dealing with the<br />\nundergraduates. A fundamental<br /><br />\nchange for the better is needed in<br />\nthis relationship and the timing is<br />\npropitious. Both sides must continue the dialogue that has begun<br />\nin an effort to open channels of<br />\ncommunication, foster a mutual<br />\nunderstanding and, most importantly, establish once and for all<br />\nthe importance of undergraduate<br />\neducation on this campus. To<br />\npursue any other course would be<br />\nan error.<br />\nThe protest was a watershed<br />\nevent, a clear indication that<br />\nHopkins students will not tolerate<br />\nhaving their core interests ignored.

Here at<br />\nJohns Hopkins, many groups<br />\norganized a number of events in<br />\nrecognition of Black History.<br />\nAlthough this year's programs<br />\nwere highly successful and<br />\nreceived a large turnout, many<br />\npeople feel that more needs to be<br />\ndone each year and that more of<br />\nthe Hopkins community must get<br />\ninvolved.<br />\nThe Black Student Union<br />\nscheduled one or two events each<br />\nweek, including an African Dinner at the Terrace Room, arranged<br />\nwith the help of Minority Affairs. Margo Butler kindled the<br />\ncafeteria's usual atmosphere and<br />\ndecor with the spirit of native<br />\nmusic from Cameron Africa,<br />\nposters featuring figures from<br />\ncolorful<br />\nHistory,<br />\nBlack<br />\nstreamers, and a video on the<br />\nHarlem Renaissance.<br />\nGabriel, a vendor of African<br />\nartifacts, was a special addition to<br />\nthe festivities. Daryl Price, cochair of the NAACP's education<br />\ncommittee, met Gabriel last year<br />\nselling his wares on the lower<br />\nquad, and listened to him recount<br />\nhis extensive travels through<br />\nmany different countries, including Ghana, Nigeria, Kenya,<br />\nand Saudi Arabia.<br />\nGabriel's tales about African<br />\nculture \"instilled fire\" in Price,<br />\ninspiring more than just pride.<br />\nPrice acquired a sense of \"knowing where [he] came from and<br />\nwhere [he was] going,\" knowing<br />\nthat he could trace his heritage<br />\nback to a \"land pf kings and<br /><br />\nqueens.\" Gabriel's travels, inspired by a curiosity about different peoples and cultures,<br />\nstimulated the same curiosity and<br />\ninquiry in many of his listeners.<br />\nThe BSU also showed a variety of movies, and sponsored a<br />\nperformance by the OLU dance<br />\ntroupe, an American school<br />\ntrained in native American dance.<br />\nRobert Johnson, sophomore, attended the performance and felt<br />\nit was entertaining and \"extremely well done.\" Johnson said that<br />\nthe troup encouraged audience<br />\nparticipation, making everyone<br />\nfeel \"like a part of what was going on.\"<br />\nPrice, who joined Johnson in<br />\nthe audience, felt drawn into a<br />\n\"cohesive unit\" and enjoyed being caught up in the novel realm<br />\nof African dance, music, and<br />\nculture.<br />\nThe dancers kicked off the performance with the ritual dance of<br />\nwelcome, and highlighted the<br />\nshow by explaining the<br />\nsignificance of various masks and<br />\ndemonstrating native African instruments such as the African<br />\nTalking Drum and the resonating<br />\nShakeray, which Price described<br />\nas a gourd in a netting of beads.<br />\nOne of the younger pupils, a little girl, surprised everyone by<br />\ngetting up and dancing for the audience. When somebody asked<br />\nwho the little one was, one of her<br />\nparents, proud and delighted,<br />\nshouted, \"She's mine! She's<br />\nmine! She's mine!\"<br />\nThe dancers ended the performance with a question and answer<br />\nsession, followed by an African<br />\nBanquet on the upper level of<br />\nShriver Hall, where the dancers<br />\nand audience intermingled and ate<br />\ncurried lamb, wheat cakes, rice<br />\nstew, cornhead, rum cake, and<br />\nalthough they couldn't remember<br /><br />\nSusan Moss<br /><br />\nand the NAACP for attracting so much enthusiastic parSophomore Robert Johnson congratulates the BSU<br />\nticipation and for \"spreading the word.\"<br />\nthe proper names for the native<br />\ndishes they tried, they found all<br />\nof them interesting, if not<br />\ndelicious.<br />\nAs a new addition to the<br />\nHopkins community, the<br />\nNAACP featured a short but informative film on the Harlem<br />\nRenaissance, an historical period<br />\nof Black American Cultural<br />\ndevelopment in the early 20th<br />\ncentury. During this era of new<br />\ndirections in art, literature,<br />\ndance, and poetry, black writers<br />\nsuch as Langston Hughes and<br />\nZora Neale Hurston rose in<br />\nprestige and overcame cultural<br />\nstereotypes. Johnson saw the film<br />\nand was inspired by those who<br />\npartook of the renaissance and<br />\nbecame \"more aware of their<br />\nsurroundings, taking control of<br />\nwhat was going on around them\"<br />\nand becoming great artists and<br />\nintellectuals.<br />\nThe NAACP also brought a<br />\nomw<br />\nrillealt<br />\n\"\"4<br />\n;0;<br /><br />\n4111111**<br />\n1101*.11110<br /><br />\n11,<br />\n\u2022<br /><br />\n11<br /><br />\neducation committee.<br />\nDaryl Price, co-chair of the NAACP's<br /><br />\nguest lecturer to campus, Professor Hudson, an expert on<br />\nAfrican-American art who taught<br />\nat JHU over the past intersession.<br />\nJohnson attended Professor Hudson's lecture and expressed an interest in establishing a permanent<br />\nplace for Hudson at Hopkins to<br />\nbegin to remedy the dire shortage<br />\nof black instructors here. During<br />\nthe lecture Hudson presented a<br />\nsynopsis of the diverse types of<br />\nAfrican and Afro-American art<br />\nand of the ways in which artists<br />\ncould be inspired.<br />\nJohnson found the subject matter new and exciting, and was inspired to learn more about<br />\nAfrican and Afro-American<br />\nhistory. Amazed at the number of<br />\nrenowned black artists, Johnson<br />\nsuddenly began to imagine how<br />\nmany reputable blacks there must<br />\nbe in other fields. Unfortunately,<br />\nthere are only a minimal number<br />\nof courses offered at Hopkins that<br />\npertain to African and AfroAmerican studies.<br />\nt.Programs were held by other<br />\ncampus organizations as well.<br />\nThe Hopkins Jewish League and<br />\nthe Black Student Union held a<br />\nforum that, according to Johnson,<br />\nwas a \"well-attended attempt to<br />\nimprove relations.\" Johnson was<br />\nalso pleasantly surprised to find<br />\nthe Chaplain's Office presenting<br />\nfilms such as Eyes on the Prize as<br />\na part of Black History Month.<br />\nJust last weekend, Black<br />\nHistory Month here at Hopkins<br />\nreached its peak with the music<br />\nof Ladysmith Black Mambazo,<br />\nfeaturing Smitty of Uganda. The<br />\ngroup, featured on Paul Simon's<br />\nGrace/and album, sang a cape/la<br />\nin their native tongue. Although<br />\nhe could not understand what the<br />\nwords meant, Price said \"the<br />\nsound was pleasing.\"<br />\n\"They didn't just stand<br />\nthere\u2014they marched and danced.<br />\nThey were really filled with<br />\nenergy,\" said Price. The rhythm<br />\nand harmony exhilarated the<br /><br />\ncrowd and, after three finales,<br />\nLadysmith received a standing<br />\novation. Price said that he found<br />\nthe performance of the African<br />\nNational Anthem especially moving, since it symbolized for him<br />\nthe struggle of the blacks in South<br />\nAfrica.<br />\nMost people felt that the month<br />\nhad been a great success. Price<br />\npinpointed Margo Butler as the<br />\nkey asset to the success of the<br />\nAfrican Dinner. \"She did things<br />\nother people didn't want to do\u2014<br />\nshe really made things happen.\"<br />\nJohnson congratulated both the<br />\nBSU and the NAACP for attracting so much enthusiastic participation and for \"spreading the<br />\nword.\" He said he had witnessed the exuberance \"spilling over<br />\ninto the community\" and drawing more people together for<br />\nBlack History Month than ever<br />\nbefore.<br />\nJohnson feels, however, that<br />\nmore must be done each year until the community can \"make<br />\ntheir voices heard above everyone<br />\nelse's\" and persuade the administration to pay more attention<br />\nto minority concerns, despite the<br />\ntaxing times.<br />\nBoth Johnson and Price thought<br />\nthat people outside of the black<br />\ncommunity showed a marked<br />\nlack of interest and participation.<br />\nThey stressed that involvement in<br />\nthese affairs is in no way confined to blacks, that events during<br />\nBlack History Month were open<br />\nto all.<br />\nIn spite of the large attendance,<br />\nJohnson \"only saw black students<br />\nat a lot of these functions.

The<br />\ncandidates this year are:<br />\nPresident: Lou Giangiulio.<br />\nVice President: Dianna DeVore and<br />\nJonathan Missner.<br />\nTreasurer: Christian Reutter.<br />\nSecretary: Shamina Jaffer and Jeff<br />\nPerlstein.<br />\nHOP Director: Howie Fried.<br />\nSophomores,juniors, and seniors are eligi-<br /><br />\nble to vote for Young Trustee. This year,<br />\ntwelve seniors are vying for the position. A<br />\nYoung Trustee serves as a full member of the<br />\nUniversity's Board of Trustees for four years.<br />\nStudents may vote for as many as five of<br />\nthe Young Trustee candidates. The top eight<br />\ncandidates will compete in a run-off. After the<br />\nrun-off, Board members will interview the top<br />\nfive candidates and nominate one before the<br />\nBoard's April meeting.<br />\nThe twelve candidates include: Michael<br />\nReid Fenzel, Scott J.

If any writein candidate receives more than ten percent<br />\nof the vote for a position, however, a run-off<br />\nfor that position will be held.<br />\nBelow are Giangiulio's responses to several<br />\nquestions we posed relating to his candidacy<br />\nand to his views on current Hopkins issues.<br />\nOn the three following pages are excerpts<br />\nfrom information forms which the Young<br />\nTrustee candidates submitted a few weeks<br />\nago.

This can be achieved through<br />\nopen forums, surveys, News-Letter op-eds,<br />\nand especially through the alreading existing standing committees of the Student<br />\nCouncil.<br />\nThe top priority of the Council as a<br />\nwhole should be to maintain a consistent<br />\nagenda of items so that work that was done<br />\nthis year and in the past can be followed<br />\nup on as long-term goals for the future.<br />\nThis can be done while addressing the<br />\neveryday concerns which invariably arise.<br />\nWhat do you think about the FiveYear Plan's content?<br />\nThe Five-Year Plan is a broad<br />\nframework to set all of the University's<br />\ndivisions, but especially Arts and Sciences,<br />\non solid financial ground. It calls for some<br />\nstrict measures in the School of Arts and<br />\nSciences to raise revenues and increase expenditures for which students and faculty<br />\ncannot but feel short-changed.<br />\nHowever, many people tend to forget<br />\nabout the provisions in the Plan which call<br /><br />\nfor large sums of money to come from<br />\nother divisions to aid Arts and Sciences,<br />\nwhich is perennially underendowed. This<br />\nis a landmark step for the University, and<br />\nif it leads to a more centralized structure<br />\nfor Johns Hopkins, this could be especially beneficial for undergraduates.<br />\nJust how this Five-Year Plan is interpreted will either make or break the<br />\nUniversity, in my opinion. My main concern is that students were not consulted<br />\nprevious to the Plan's release, and at present there is no mechanism for future student involvement. This input is crucial for<br />\na course of action which so directly affects<br />\nour quality of education.<br />\nHow ought students be involved in implementing the Plan? As president, how<br />\nwill you insure that involvement?<br />\nStudents out to be involved in both an<br />\nadvisory capacity to the Dean of Arts and<br />\nSciences and also at a decision-making<br />\nlevel in the implementation of the Plan.<br />\nThis is necessary since members of the advisory committee to the Dean could give<br />\ntheir overall status reports on departmental conditions for undergraduates and<br />\ngraduate students alike.<br />\nBut whether the Dean's office is<br /><br />\nallocated the resources needed to put these<br />\nrecommendations into effect is the consideration of a financial review group for<br />\nthe overseeing of the Five-Year Plan, on<br />\nwhich there should be student representation. As president I will work to insure this<br />\ninvolvement by meeting with Provost<br />\nLombardi, Dean Armstrong, and all concerned to tbster the type of discussion<br />\nneeded to create such student input.<br />\nI urge other students to become involved in the process by writing letters to<br />\nboth their Deans and the Provost with their<br />\nspecific concerns, as well as participating<br />\nresponsibly in all open forums of<br />\ndiscussion.<br />\nHas the Human Climate Task Force<br />\nReport been forgotten? How would you,<br />\nand can you implement its recommendations?<br />\nThe Human Climate Task Force Report<br />\naddressed a broad range of issues for concern on the Homewood campus and for the<br />\nmost part was right on target. Its recommendations should be used to guide the<br />\nlong-term planning of a consistent agenda<br />\nfor the Student Council in the near future,<br />\nsince most of the problems focus on issues<br />\nwhich are not readily resolved. But I would<br /><br />\nurge that the Student Council address these<br />\nitems one at a time, so as not to lose focus,<br />\nuntil some concrete resolution is found.<br />\nOnly in this fashion can real progress be<br />\nmade.<br />\nName two or three other issues that<br />\nyou plan to address in more detail next<br />\nyear.<br />\nI can foresee the Five-Year Plan and its<br />\nimplications involving a lot of the Council's time and efforts for next year.<br />\nHowever, I would like to see issues such<br />\nas the faculty advising structure in the<br />\nSchool of Arts and Sciences, an<br />\nundergraduate judicial board and honor<br />\nsystem, and the contracting and service<br />\naspects of the campus bookstore continue<br />\nto be addressed in detail.<br />\nI am especially interested in maintaining close contact with our alumni groups<br />\nto work on setting goals for long-term<br />\namenities. A major issue of importance<br />\nwhich should be addressed as soon as<br />\npossible is to establish student representation in the search process for the next<br />\npresident of the University. This will continue into the following year.<br /><br />\n14/M1ARCH<br /><br />\n1989<br /><br />\nYOUNG TRUSTEE '89<br />\nMichcol -R ic<br /><br />\nUjjal \n<br />\nFENZEL<br /><br />\nGHOSHTAGORE<br /><br />\nOrganizations and Activities: Football (1-4)\u2014Captain 1988; Track 1; Vice<br />\nPresident (Junior Class); ROTC<br />\n(1-4)\u2014Ranger Commander (Cadet<br />\nMajor); Student Council Representative; University's Public Interest Investment Advisory Committee (3-4);<br />\nconducted Advanced Physical Training sessions three times a week (present); conduct and instruct classes on<br />\ntactics three times a week (present).<br />\nAcademic Area: Economics<br />\nOutside Activities: Sales Representative, W.R.

Although I realize that a<br />\nYoung Trustee's influence is limited, I<br />\nhope to fulfill the position's promise by<br />\nexpressing student concerns\u2014about<br />\nhousing, the 5-year plan, etc.\u2014to<br />\nJohns Hopkins' Trustees.<br />\nStudent facilities at Homewood, particularly housing, are seriously inadequate. The shortage of University<br />\nhousing keeps rents high and, more<br />\nimportantly, makes it difficult for upperclassmen to maintain a sense of<br />\ncommunity. In the competitive atmosphere which often prevails at<br />\nHopkins, such a sense of community<br />\nshould be encouraged, through the<br />\nthoughtful addition of new housing.<br />\nMany of us came here because of<br />\nsmall classes and Hopkins' reputation.<br />\nIf, as proposed, enrollment is raised<br />\nand faculty are not replaced, Hopkins'<br /><br />\nreputation will certainly decline, and<br />\nwe will be forever cheated. Instead,<br />\nthe University's structure should be<br />\ncentralized to allow its profit-making<br />\ndivisions to bear part of Homewood's<br />\ncosts. Effecting such a change will require convincing the Board that a topnotch undergraduate reputation does<br />\nhave significant value.<br />\nIf these issues concern you, I hope<br />\nyou will give me the chance to express<br />\nthem, as Young Trustee '89.<br /><br />\nScott J<br /><br />\n'Davi\u00b0 J.<br /><br />\nFITZGERALD<br /><br />\nGIARRACCO<br /><br />\nOrganizations and Activities: President of the Student Council; President<br />\nof the Senior Class; President of the<br />\nSophomore Class; President of the<br />\nDormitory Council; Chairman of the<br />\nEducation Committee; Member of the<br />\nVarsity Crew Team; Member of the<br />\nJunior Varsity Basketball Team;<br />\nMember of the Sailing Team; Cofounder and President of the Hopkins<br />\nHomeless Shelter Project; Member of<br />\nthe Delta Upsilon Fraternity.<br />\nAcademic Area: International<br />\nStudies<br />\nOutside Activities: Staff worker at<br />\nhomeless shelter; Nautilus Fitness instructor; Stack Assistant in Library;<br />\nCampus Posterer.<br />\nI plan to attend law school in either<br />\nWashington, D.C. or New York City.<br />\nStatement: During the past four<br />\nyears, it has been my pleasure to participate in a wide variety of extracurricular activities at Johns Hopkins.<br />\nFrom the Presidency ol the Student<br />\nCouncil to rowing varsity crew, from<br />\nbrotherhood in the Delta Upsilon<br />\nFraternity to being co-founder and current Director of the Hopkins Homeless<br />\nShelter Project, I have enjoyed a<br />\nbroad and rewarding collegiate experience.

Yet,<br />\neven more importantly, I must present<br />\nthe reasons why I desire to be a<br />\nYoung Trustee.<br /><br />\nOur university faces a period of transition. From the deficit in the School of<br />\nArts and Sciences and the subsequent<br />\nintroduction of the Five-Year Plan, to<br />\nthe expansion of next year's freshman<br />\nclass and the implementation of a two<br />\ntiered system of tuition, important decisions are being made which will affect<br />\nall of us, as undergraduates, and even<br />\nas alumni.

At this<br />\npoint in time, it is even more apparent<br />\nthat responsible fiscal planning must<br />\nbe demanded of University officials.<br />\nSince my sophomore year I have<br />\nbeen directly involved in the \"recruitment\" of students, because I believe<br />\nthat The Johns Hopkins University is<br />\none of the better institutions where an<br />\neducation can be obtained. This includes all the aspects of an education.<br />\nDuring my four years here I, like many<br />\nof the other candidates, have<br />\ndeveloped a genuine love and appreciation of this school.

My friends and neighbors<br />\nworked at the University. These experiences, naturally, drew me closer<br />\nto Hopkins.<br />\nNone of the current Young Trustees<br />\nare engineers. The Whiting School of<br />\nEngineering has been steadily growing since I've been here, and should<br />\nhave representation on the Board. As<br /><br />\nan electrical engineering major, I can<br />\nbe that representative, and hence, will<br />\nbe able to discuss issues and concerns facing our engineering students<br />\nand faculty.<br />\nKnowing that Hopkins is concerned<br />\nwith recruiting and retention of minority students, I (being a minority) will be<br />\nable to give a view of JHU from a different perspective.<br />\nBecause of my relationship to the<br />\ncommunity and to Hopkins I should be<br />\nthe next Young Trustee of this<br />\nUniversity.<br /><br />\nOrganizations and Activities: Chairman, Senior Class Speaker Committee; Chairman, Student Activities Commission (3); Treasurer, Student Council (3); Student Council Career Advising Committee (1,2); Student Council<br />\nEducation Committee (1,2,3); Spring<br />\nFair Social Committee (1,2,3); Orientation Staff (1,2); Class of 1989 Social<br />\nCommittee.<br />\nAcademic Area: Economics<br />\nOutside Activities: Red Cross<br />\nVolunteer<br />\nFuture Plans: Graduate School in<br />\nPublic Policy and then on to a career<br />\nin Public Service.<br />\nStatement: Like most of the other<br />\napplicants for the position of Young<br />\nTrustee, I will attempt to represent the<br />\nviews of the undergraduate population<br />\nof Homewood Campus. I, however,<br />\nwish to accomplish more than this.<br />\nTaking several of my classes at SAIS<br />\nover the past year has permitted me<br />\nto see a side of Hopkins that I never<br />\nknew existed. Few of the students at<br />\nHomewood know of the opportunities<br />\nwhich are available to them at the<br />\nother campuses which compose our<br />\nuniversity.
