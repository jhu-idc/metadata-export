The<br />\ngroup switched to Phi Kappa Psi<br />\nthis summer because they were<br />\nnot satisfied with the response<br />\nthey received from Pike.<br />\nAccording to Harold Barr,<br />\npresident of the fraternity and<br />\ngroup spokesman,\"Phi Kappa Psi<br />\nNational and area Alumni are<br />\nvery interest in revelling the<br />\nHopkins Chapter.\" ;le continued<br />\n, \"Our main objective now is to<br />\nget a house. At Hopkins, it is<br />\npractically impossible for a<br />\nfraternity to exist without one.''<br />\nThe fraternity had tried to<br />\npurchase a row house of the<br />\n2900 block of St. Paul Street,<br />\nbut were turned down by the<br />\nzoning board because of a<br />\npetition against the move<br />\nsubmitted by the Charles Village<br />\nCivic Association.<br />\nBeta House, 3906 Canterbury<br />\nRoad, was sold for $20,500. Barr<br />\nsaid that Beta Theta Pi National<br />\nattended the auction and actually<br />\nbid against the Phi Kappa<br />\nrepresentative from Charles<br />\nTown Investment, Inc.<br />\nHe explained, \"Beta- wanted to<br />\ninsure that the mortgage that<br />\nthey held on the house would be<br />\ncovered. If the building was going<br />\nto sell for less than the value of<br />\nthe two mortgages on it, they<br />\nwould have bought it for resale.\"<br />\nBesides the purchase price of<br />\nthe house, Phi Kappa must<br />\nborrow an estimated $20,000 to<br />\n$30,000 for renovations which<br />\nwill be required .before the new<br />\nfraternity can move in.<br />\n<br />\nDr. Allen Wingrove, chairman<br />\nof chemistry at Towson State<br />\nand Director of Alumni Affairs<br />\non the East Coast for Phi Kappa<br />\nPsi National, will chair the<br />\nHopkins Phi Kappa Psi Housing<br />\nCorporation which, will be<br />\ncomposed of Alumni and whose<br />\nfunction will be to institute loans<br />\nin order to finance the house<br />\npurchase and the needed<br />\nrenovations.<br />\nAt present, the fraternity<br />\n. hopes to make the house<br />\n<br />\nBeta House<br />\n<br />\nGeorge Owen<br />\n<br />\ninhabitable by February 1, in<br />\ntime for rush.

The<br />\nfirst came on a 14-yard pass from<br />\nLion quarterback Glen Sliker to<br />\nHarsharny.

The<br />\nmajority of transfers are majoring<br />\nin the Social and Behavioral<br />\nSciences or the Humanities, while<br />\ntwo students are registered in the<br />\nQuantitative Sciences, three in<br />\nEngineering, and three are<br />\nundecided. According to<br />\nThomas, the number of transfer<br />\napplications have declined<br />\nslightly in the past two years, in<br />\nspite of what many educators see<br />\nas a trend toward greater<br />\nmobility. Substantial increases in<br />\ntwo-year community college<br />\nenrollment were expected 'to<br />\ncause an increase in transfer<br />\nstudents.

The Hopkins<br />\nteam obviously outclassed their<br />\nopponents, but were unable<br />\nuse this advantage to tally the<br />\ngo-ahead score.<br />\nThe lone Hopkins goal was<br />\nscored in the first half by right<br />\nwinger Karen Mosely. Loyola<br />\ntallied its lone score in the<br />\nsecond half. This is also Loyola's<br /><br />\nbefore yielding two touchdowns<br />\nlate in the second quarter. The<br />\nfirst came on a 14-yard pass from<br />\nLion quarterback Glen Sliker to<br />\nHarsharny. Stako's conversion<br />\n(the first of four on the day) gave<br />\nthe Garden Staters a 7-6 edge.<br />\nThat looked to be the halftime<br />\nscore but, with only ten seconds<br />\nremaining in the second quarter,<br />\nSliker spotted Taylor and fired a<br />\n31-yeard scoring strike to him.<br />\nThe successful conversion gave<br />\nTrenton State a 14-6 lead to take<br />\ninto the locker room.<br />\nThe second half was all State<br />\nas the Blue Jays were unable to<br />\nstrike paydirt.

Unable to pinpoint the<br />\nexact causes of the Jays' loss,<br />\nCoach Dennis Cox chalked it up<br />\nto \"inexperience.\" Many areas of<br />\nthe Blue Jays' game showed signs<br />\nof definite improvement.
