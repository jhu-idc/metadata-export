We do not correct spelling or grammar.<br />\n<br />\nUnfortunantly this was not the case. In an effort to get<br />\nmy artical printed in the Newsletter. 1 was subjected to a<br />\nbarrage of snide remarks, criticism, and just general<br />\nrunaround, all to convince me, the writer, that my<br />\n<br />\nTo the Editor:<br />\n<br />\ninterest was totally unessesary. Throughout the entire<br />\nescapade, I was quietly assured by many of the editors of<br />\n<br />\nThere are many procedures and policies within this<br />\nUniversity which I object to and am angered by.<br />\nsomehow it is easier to accept the conflicts which Yet,<br />\noccur<br />\nbetween administration and students, than<br />\nthe<br />\nantagonisms which arise between students. I expect the<br />\nformer, yet the fact that students, given power, will act<br />\nand react no better (or worse) than administrators shocks<br />\nInc.<br />\nThis point was sadly driven home upon my enterence<br />\ninto the Newsletter Office last Wednesday night. I had<br />\nbeen prepared, through a previous experience with tile<br />\nNewktter, to defend my artical. Still, no amount of<br />\nforewarning could have eased my amazement at the<br />\nextreme example of \"editor chauvanism\" I found there.<br />\nThe fact that I had written an artical on the controversal<br />\nissue of ealestine is not totally unconnected with the<br />\ndubiols \"welcome\" I received at the Newsletter. Yet,<br />\nmore finportantly, the simple reality that I, a student at<br />\nJohns Hopkins University, had written something wnich<br />\nhad seemed to me to be relevant to the student body,and<br />\nthat 1, again a student at Hopkins nad risen out of my<br />\nown, and general campus, apathy, to take a personal stand<br />\non this issue, should entitle me to the printing of my<br />\nartical without creating too much hardship.<br />\n<br />\ntheir natural \"literary genius\" which, of course, was<br />\nentirely capable of creating a newspaper masterpeice on<br />\nits own.<br />\nAlthough I was \"lucky\" enough, after the general<br />\ncorrections, rewording, and threats of'rewriting, to get the<br />\neditors' approval for publication, there was still the<br />\nadmonition that there might not be enough space in I his<br />\nissue to include my article or that further editing might<br />\noccur. Naturally, when I returned the next day, I<br />\nfound,<br />\nto the editors' complete \"sorrow\", that were was no<br />\nroom within the Newsletter for my article that week.<br />\nWhat I later learned was that the editor nad deemed my<br />\n,article irrelevent to 'campus news since it .did not deal<br />\ndirectly with toe island of Johns Hopkins (a (reatful<br />\nDead Concert was relevent!). I suppose I should have been<br />\nencouraged by the call of \"1 do hope you will write for<br />\nthe newsletter again!\" yet somehow this remark could not<br />\nplacate the feeling of frustration and anger I felt upon<br />\nleaving the Newletter Office.<br />\nSitting at my desk now, I have many harsn words for<br />\nthe staff of the New/encr - a small and exclusive elite<br />\nwithin Johns Hopkins University.

Today, students have replaced this eagerness by<br />\na new attitude to succeed--the need for above-average<br />\ngrades. This new attitude makes for scholarly work that is<br />\nadmirable, but work for a different reason. At one time,<br />\nthe education itself was most important. Now, the grades<br />\nreceived while being educated are of primary concern.<br />\nThis new attitude was caused in many ways by the<br />\nstudents themselves, but other factors have also made for<br />\nthe change. The greatest cause of this change came from<br />\nthe graduate institutions requirement of near perfection<br />\nfor admittance. A student cannot help but be affected by<br />\nthis dread of rejection at such an early stage in life. Yet<br />\nStill, the students themselves further alter the past<br />\neducational philosophy. Students make course selections<br />\noften solely on the ease with which one can receive an A.<br />\nStudents avoid courses that might well interest tilem, and<br />\nthe student's own new attitudes has drawn him away<br />\nfrom the fundamental purpose of education. Perhaps<br />\nthe future was more certain for a hard-working student a<br />\ndecade ago, but the improvement ofthe mind still<br />\nmotivated students to lear . Today's student often ends<br />\nfour years of undergraduate study with a dark future<br />\nahead, even after studying hard. We cannot change the<br />\nbitter competition wat admission to graduate school<br />\nbrings out, but perhaps a student's ideals of success can be<br />\nreevaluated. Success doesnot have to be measured by the<br />\nA's received so that one can be admitted to graduate<br />\nschool, but by the knowledge an undergraduate has<br />\ngained. In other words, what students of a decade ago<br />\ntook for granted; that is, eagerness, fervor, and a desire to<br />\nearn, tne students of today should reinstill.<br />\n<br />\nSenior Class president Frank Faillace hard at work<br />\n<br />\nPreMeds<br />\nOver sixty per cent of the Hopkins students who<br />\napplied to medical schools were accepted, according to a<br />\nreport presented by Dr. John Gryder, chairman of tile<br />\npre-medical recommendations committee, Tuesday night.<br />\nA statistical breakdown of acceptances according to<br />\nGPA showed that 62% of those that applied to medical<br />\nschool from the class of '77 were accepted. 19% of tilose<br />\napplicants with GPA's below 3.0 were granted admission.<br />\n31% of those applying with GPA's between 3.0 and 3.2<br />\nwere accepted. There was 47% acceptance of those with<br />\naverages between 3.2 and 3.4, 76% acceptance with<br />\naverages between 3.4 and 3.6, and 87% acceptance with<br />\naverages between 3.6 and 3.8. 100% of those with averages<br />\nbetween 3.8 and 4.0 were granted admission. These<br />\nfigures have not been corrected for those accepted to the<br />\n2-5 program or for early graduates accepted to medical<br />\nschool without their college degrees. Dr. Gryder<br />\nemphasized that comparison of acceptance rates between<br />\ncolleges may be misleading. Schools compile their<br />\nstatistical data differently, so meaningful comparisons<br />\ncannot be made until the details of the statistical analysis<br />\nare known.<br />\nTwo main criteria used by medical schools in evaluating<br />\napplications are grade averages and MCAT .scores. A<br />\nscatter plot of acceptances versus MCAT scores and GPA<br />\nfor the class of '77 showed that acceptances were more<br />\nclosely correlated to the GPA than the MCAT score.<br />\nAccording to Dr. Gryder, Hopkins pre-med students t,:nd<br />\nto do well on weir medical boards.

It's just that my time here at JHU is finally<br />\ndrawing to a close, and frankly I'm damn gl ad of it.<br />\nI remember back when I was a sophomore, and we<br />\nwere planning the Centennial issue of the N-L. The idea<br />\ncame up to nave some of the more famous alumni of the<br />\npaper write articies about their days on the paper. It was<br />\nimmediately dismissed on tile grounds that contacting<br />\nsuch luminaries as Russell Baker and requesting their<br />\nservices would be utterly futile. At the time I couldn't<br />\nunderstand why someone like Russell Baker wouldn't be<br />\nthrilled at the prospect of recounting his college days, but<br />\nas my term at this University passed, I began to.<br />\nunderstand: College lias but one purpose. Getting out.<br />\nPerhaps the allusion to RussellBaker may be somewhat<br />\npresumptious; after all, it seems fairly doubtful that I will<br />\nsomeday be an editorial writer for the New York Times.<br />\nBut it's easy to see how distance and bitterness could<br />\nfilter in.<br />\nThis past semester, I have been all but in abstensia from.<br />\nmany of my classes, and campus life in general. A large<br />\nmeasure of this was due to the fact that in addition to the<br />\njob I have had for the past three years in Towson, I have<br />\nbeen working as the music editor for The ity Paper. I am<br />\nbecoming a professional journalist, and frankly, classes are<br />\nbecoming irrelevant.<br />\nI hesitate to say that, though, because it often seems<br />\nthat it's not so much what I'm being taught is out of place<br />\nbut rather that it's my fellow students who seem out of<br />\nstep with reality. A few weeks ago, I had a terrible dream<br />\nthat Hopkins had turned into a grotesquely large high<br />\nschool. I wound up spending most of my time running<br />\n<br />\ninto hall monitors (who curiously resemble our student<br />\ngovernment functionaries), wiio wouldn't believe me<br />\nwhen I told them that they couldn't do anything to me<br />\nbecause I had graduated. I wound up being given<br />\ndetention, and woke up as I was being hauled screaming<br />\nto the graduate stacks on D level.<br />\nOf course, it's easy to say that considering my dealings<br />\nwith student government functionaries over the past four<br />\nyears it's a wonder I'm not a total paranoid, but<br />\nnonetheless, the point stands: you Hoppies then to take<br />\nyour little microcosm far too seriously. Hey, don't get me<br />\nwrong -- this is no high-horse speech. I've been just as<br />\nguilty in my time as the worst of you. But I've seen tile<br />\nreal world, and, uh, this ain't it....<br />\nIn all fairness, the blame should be realistically<br />\napproportioned, and this particular delusion is obviously<br />\none that nas emanated from the top of our little social<br />\nsystem. It's easy to see how the faculty of a research<br />\noriented University such as ours (didja catch Uncle<br />\nStevie's little spiel in the Sun the other night?) would<br />\ntend to nurture an intellectual insularity, and many<br />\nprofessors, assistant professors, grad students and lab<br />\nassistants feel almost righteous in their assertion that<br />\nHopkins is both the best and the only of all possible<br />\nworlds.<br />\nAnd why shouldn't they? I mean, that is wilat they're<br />\ngetting paid for. All I ask is, hey! keep in mind that there<br />\nare those of us who believe that there is life beyond the<br />\nlibraries and laboratories. I had an instructor once who<br />\ntold me that I would be best advised to forsake my<br />\ninvolvements with music and journalism and devote my<br />\ntime to his subject, which was Roman Imperial<br />\ngovernment. Had I been the sarcastic sort, I could have<br />\npointed out to him that his devotion to tne glory days of<br />\nRome had yet to earn nim a doctorate, let alone a<br />\nprofessorship, but instead I stumbled out of his office,<br />\nnumbly mumbling \"fuck you\" under my breatn.<br />\nI did pass his course (barely), but I also kept up my<br />\nwork in those secular fields he so disdained. To date, my<br />\ntravails in music and journalism have earned me a<br />\nsignificant portion of my income in addition to the thrill<br />\n<br />\nof becoming published in local arid national organs of the<br />\npress, while on the other hand my knowledge of the inner<br />\nworkings of Imperial Rome has only come into use when<br />\nwatching 1 Claudius on tv.<br />\nSo why, you may ask, have I spent my last four years<br />\nand several thousand dollars (many of wnich I could not<br />\na fford) to stay on at this particular station of Academic<br />\nisolationism? Because, at its best, Hopkins is still the best<br />\nschool I could 'lave chosen, and certainly tile only one I<br />\nwould go to if I had to do it all over again. Why? Because<br />\ndespite the occasional stupidities of the place, they have<br />\nprovided me with an excellent liberal arts education \\voile<br />\nat the same time leaving me enough iilone that I could not<br />\nonly decide for myself how to mink und what to do, but<br />\nto excel at bob'.<br />\nPerhaps that's wag galls me the most, that tiiis is such<br />\nan excellent place, and yet it still is riddled wit,'<br />\nproblems. I feel that the enormous tuition, nowever much'<br />\nI may nave suffered to scrape it together (yes, me; my<br />\neducation has been self-funded since my sophomore<br />\nyear), was somehow worth it; and yet like tne owner of a<br />\nlarge and expensive car, I fed that I have the right to be<br />\nincensed with even the tiniest flaws. Because, dLimmit, it<br />\nmeans too mum to just slough it off....<br />\nYean, well, enough passion for one article. I'm leaving<br />\nHopkins in a few months, and when I finally leave<br />\nBaltimore, I doubt I will return to Homewood. I may<br />\nkeep in touch with tire few faculty members whom I have<br />\ncome to admire, but the rest of my time will be devoted<br />\nto becoming a career journalist and ignoring letters asking<br />\ncontributions to the alumni funds. They managed to get<br />\nmy tuition (at least, so far they have) -- that will probably<br />\nbe it.<br />\nSo farewell, JHU. And to those of you \\vim remain,<br />\njust remember that however you wind up mien you leave,<br />\nwhat you are is what you've made yourself.

Faculty members are completing the current<br />\nphase of their research in anticipation of the summer<br />\nbreak. Adminstrators are winding up the semester's<br />\nbusiness and look forward to not having.to deal with<br />\nstudents and faculty for three months. The issues of<br />\nrunning Concern -- tenure, teaching, and the rest -- will<br />\nlikewise enjoy their annual respite, and it seems fair to<br />\nSpeculate that no new issues will erupt ,before the term<br />\nends. As a graduating senior, I'm not going Co mourn my<br />\nsojourn at Hopkins, \u2022 nor will I stoop to the disgusting<br />\nsentimentalism of reminiscence -- I'll leave that to some<br />\nOther offensive schlep. Insofar as this University is<br />\nconcerned, my interest is not in its past, but in its future.<br />\nHopkins continues to rank among the leading academic<br />\ninstitutions in the country. But it has its problems and<br />\nweaknessses, as well as its strengths: there at.3 fissures<br />\nWithin the Homcw000d community -- diffecences in<br />\noutlook between students. an faculty and between<br />\nstudents and adminstrators. From an undergraduate<br />\nPerspective, it is easy to fault the faculty and<br />\nadministration for some of these. And frankly. I think a<br />\nPortion of the fault is well-placed -- not all, but some. Too<br />\ninfrequently is -student input actively solicited or heeded<br />\nin major policy formulation. Too often are students -individual students and individual Student Councils -- seen<br />\nas transient phenomena warranting no special credence or<br />\nConsultation. Too often. it is true, undergraduate<br />\n,education takes a back seat to graduate study and<br />\nresearch. I am informed that Daniel Coit Gilman's grand<br />\nscheme was to found an undergraduate institution<br />\n<br />\njennifer bishop<br />\n<br />\nMonkey Business<br />\n<br />\nBy David Chesanow<br />\nuniquely designed to forge capable scholars for graduate<br />\nstudy. But the \"best laid schemes\" we all know,somehow<br />\nget screwed up. Either the bulk of emphasis is wrongly<br />\ndiverted away from undergraduate instruction, or efforts<br />\nto remedy the situation by introducing \"innovative\"<br />\nprgrams are shoddy or haphazard. Labeled<br />\n\"experimental\" in order to silence their crtics, and then<br />\nexpected to succeed. So what's the point in balancing the<br />\nbudget, or keeping tuition increases minimal, when that<br />\nlittle mutant bastard called Mediocrity squeezes out some<br />\nother crack in the basement moulding. You can create as.<br />\nmany \"innovative\" )legree programs as there were hairs<br />\non Dainel Gilman's hoary head, but .teaching suffers all<br />\nthe same, and though we look with hope to the upcoming<br />\nCurriculum Review to help set things right, it is<br />\ndiscouraging that we have had to wait so long.<br />\nWhat does all this mean in terms of student<br />\nparticipation in the decision-making process. It means the<br />\nstruggle (not to sound melodramatic) is all uphill. The<br />\ncredibility of the Student Council as a means of<br />\npromulgating the student viewpoint has always been<br />\n<br />\nquestioned in all sectors of the Hopkins community. Most<br />\ndistressing, however, is that this doubt is a consequence of<br />\nthe rampant apathy that characterizes the students<br />\nthemselves. A year ago, I contended that the source of the<br />\nCouncil's power is the support of the student body. I<br />\nsupport the assertion all the more vehemently now. The<br />\nStudent Council will be consigned to impotence<br />\nunless<br />\nthe students at large express their interest, lend<br />\na hand,<br />\nand stand behind it. Yet in the referendum on<br />\nthe<br />\nStudent Body Constitution, the 25% voting required<br />\nto<br />\nvalidate the results was barely attained. And the<br />\nCounc,i1<br />\nis till viewed as a clique of power hungry pllitical<br />\nbosses<br />\nout to serve no one but themselves. What<br />\nstudents fail to<br />\nrealize is that Council members are not servants,<br />\nbut<br />\nstudents, elected by other students to further<br />\ntlieir<br />\ncollective interests. Unlike tl_eir counterparts at various<br />\nother universities, they receive neither academic credit<br />\nnor salary, yet they are still the target of petty and<br />\nunfounded derision. And all the while, interest lags, and<br />\nlittle gets done. Only when c. crisis impends do<br />\nstudents<br />\nsnap to and mobilize. Amidst the Calendar<br />\nChange<br />\ncontroversy last year, a placard was slung from the<br />\nstaue<br />\nof William Welch before Shriver Hall. It read<br />\n\"What does<br />\nMuller really want?\" More pressing still, what<br />\ndo the<br />\nstudents really want?

We used to do it absolutely nonstop; first<br />\nthing in the morning, between classes, after lunch, before<br />\nrunning, after dinner and so on tnrough the nignt. We<br />\nnever did any work, and we never felt guilty about it.<br />\neither. As far as we were concerned, that's what wewere<br />\nthere for - blowing dope and having a good time.<br />\nAnd was it ever a good the! Most of our parties were<br />\nheld at The Dam, a secluded paradise dominated by a<br />\nhuge lawn looking out over a crystal-clear lake which<br />\ndisappeared down a spectacular waterfall . The lave was<br />\nused for skinny-dipping, after which hordes of us would<br />\nlie around in the sun loafing, throwing frisbees and<br />\nsmoking until we nad no brains to feel.<br />\nSo there I was - fourteen years old with my flair just<br />\nbeginning to creep down over the edge of my collar,<br />\nsurrounded by radiant, nubile females passing me bowl<br />\nafter bowl of black moroccan nash. Can you blame me<br />\nwiten I say it never occurred to me to do anything else?<br />\nDoes it surprise you wnen I say I wanted nothing more<br />\nout of life than to stay stoned 24 nours a day? I admit<br />\nthat boarding school occasionally got a little stifling - but<br />\nso what if I had to go to cnapel every morning, and eat at<br />\nan assigned table, and be in bed by 9:30 every night? I<br />\ndidn't care. Rules are made to be broken, and besides, I<br />\nknew everything would be all right once I made it to<br />\ncollege.<br />\nAh, college! From the moment I started reading about<br />\nit in Time magazine, I knew what it would be like: heavy<br />\npolitics, free love and LSD - not to mention unlimited<br />\nquantities of Columbian Gold. I could nardly wait. After.<br />\nall, wasn't this what education is all about? Being given a<br />\nlittle freedom and a safe place to test your wings? If our<br />\nparties at boarding school were extravagant, think of wilat<br />\nlife at college would be like!<br />\n<br />\n\u2022 A freshman from New York City, intent on<br />\nevaluating his first year at Hopkins, prefaced his remarks<br />\nwith an apologetic, \"although I do get stoned all the<br />\ntime....\" He accompanied this statement with an<br />\nexpressive, exasperated rollirk of nis bloodshot eyes. The<br />\nimplication was clearly that this was not iiis desired state,<br />\nyet like so many closet tokers left over from the fabulous<br />\nSixties, he continues to smoke - furtively, in secret, and<br />\noften alone.<br />\nTite salient feature of these illustrations is not that<br />\nthese people are \"addicted\" to marijuana. The crux of the<br />\nmatter is that, unlike most alcoholics, heavy marijuana<br />\nsmokers tend to be highly' aware of and extremely<br />\ndepressed about their habit - especially when they get<br />\nstoned.<br />\nDon't get me wrong. I'm not proud that I smoke dope,<br />\neither. In fact, I'm ashamed of it - just like everybody<br />\nelse. What I want to determine is exactly what causes this<br />\nshame - for it seems to me to be not so much related to<br />\nthe fact of being addicted to a drug as being a direct<br />\nbyproduct of the drug itself.<br />\n<br />\nwas first beginning to come into vogue, it really was a<br />\nsymbol of rebellion - and nothing more. Now that we<br />\n\"revolution\" is \"over,\" people are discovering that tile<br />\neffects of even moderate smoking are not really all that<br />\npleasant. Many of us are also learning that there is such a<br />\nthing as addiction to marijuana, even if it's only<br />\npsychological. And believe me, constant puffing can get<br />\nto be a real drag.<br />\nStill, old ways die hard, and many people wit\u00b0 wish to<br />\nreject conventional society still narbor the vague notion<br />\nthat smoking dope is somehow a prerequisite to joining<br />\nthe counterculture. Consequently, once these people<br />\nmake the all-important decision not to smoke, they feel<br />\nobliged to emphasize that their abstinence does not<br />\nconstitute a rejection of the drug.<br />\nThis increasingly prevalent attitude creates a new, and<br />\nfascinating, double standard. For example, a close friend<br />\nof mine and I were recently discussing tile possibility of<br />\ndriving out to a-farm in western Maryland this afternoon.<br />\nEarly in our conversation lie warned me, \"I'm afraid I<br />\nwon't want to smoke any dope.\" He paused, then added<br />\n<br />\n\u2014 \u2014Ar<br />\nLast fall I came to Johns Hopkins as a freshman, six<br />\nyears older and only a little wiser. Granted, I've settled<br />\ndown a bit since the nalcyon years of my youth - but I<br />\nfully expected to be able to cut loose and enjoy a good<br />\nparty once in a while. As a matter of fact, after a couple<br />\nof years of working and living alone I was really looking<br />\nforward to it. Imagine my surprise, then, wilen I<br />\ndiscovered that nobody on this campus smokes dope.<br />\nI don't mean that literally, of course - quite a few<br />\nHoppies like to catch a buzz over the weekend, or stay<br />\nstoned during Rush Week, or sneak a quick bong hit<br />\nbefore they go to bed at night. But it's different. It really<br />\nis. Somehow, smoking dope isn't thought of as being<br />\nmuch fun anymore.<br />\nTo begin with, the stoner community at Hopkins seems<br />\nto be virtually devoid of females, and those girls who do<br />\nindulge tend to do so in small groups, behind closed<br />\ndoors. For that matter, it never seems to occur to anyone<br />\nto move the party outside. Perhaps it's just the fact that<br />\nwe live in a city, but I'm willing to bet that most of the<br />\nbongs on this campus nave never seen the lignt of day.<br />\nMore importantly, however, the few students at<br />\nHopkins who continue to get high regularly seem totally<br />\ndifferent from the tokers of yesteryear. When I was a<br />\nyoungster, people were proud they smoked dope. They<br />\nused to brag about it, convince their friends to try it, talk<br />\nabout the goddamn stuff all the time. Nowadays, if a<br />\nperson consumes an inordinate amount of zeet, they like<br />\nto keep it a secret. Not because it's illegal - that's not a<br />\nconsideration anymore. But marijuana seems to nave gone<br />\nthe way of the cigarette: in a remarkably short period of<br />\ntime, blatant, carefree smoking has become tabOo.<br />\nFurthermore, those persons who do smoke heavily often<br />\nconsider themselves trapped by the drug, and make<br />\nfrequent (and unsuccessful) attempts to give it up.<br />\nPerhapsia couple of examples will better illustrate my<br />\npoint:<br />\n\u2022A fellow boarding school veteran on my floor - and a<br />\nfrequent smoking companion - made a resolution during<br />\nthe first week of the fall term to give up smoking after ne<br />\nhad finished his final summer ounce. That resolution has<br />\nbeen repeated innumerable times since - only to be<br />\nrescinded within 48 hours due to a sudden, irresistible<br />\ncraving which can only be alleviated by rushing out of the<br />\ndorm at midnight and scoring a nickel bag. Last weekend,<br />\nin a desperate attempt to study for nis exams, this student<br />\nentrusted our housemaster with nis bong because as ne<br />\nexplains it, \"I don't trust myself with it anymore.\"<br />\nPAGE8/MAY 5, 1978'<br />\n<br />\nillustration by Lisa Kay Pease<br />\n<br />\nAfter all, surely nobody can argue that marijuana is<br />\nmore dangerous than alcohol - yet drinking nas never been<br />\nmore popular. Why? Because despite its dangers, getting<br />\nplastered can be a hell of a lot of fun. It breaks down our<br />\ndeepest inhibitions, making us giddy, and wild, and<br />\ngenerally enables us to loosen up and have a good time.<br />\nDope's not like that. It tends to make the user<br />\nextremely introspective, reminding him of all ais troubles<br />\ninstead of nelping him to forget. What's worse, after<br />\nrepeated usage it starts to grow on him, like a cancer, so<br />\nthat before long lie's not really happy when he is stoned;<br />\nit's just that ne's miserable when he's not.<br />\nTaking all this into consideration, the obvious question<br />\nis: why did it seem like so much fun in the first place?<br />\nAre my happy memories of boarding school merely an<br />\nillusion? Or is ther,2, some fundamental difference between<br />\nthe way people smoked dope then and the way they do<br />\nnow?<br />\nI'm inclined to favor the latter alternative - and unless<br />\nI'm mistaken, it has something to do with marijuana<br />\nbecoming a part of the status quo. For back when dope<br />\n<br />\nin an encouraging tone,\"But you can go anead and smoke<br />\nas much as you like!\"<br />\nWhat's going on here? Why do we nave to apologize foi<br />\nbeing straight? After all, we already feel guilty when we<br />\ndo smoke marijuana - do we also have to feel guilty when<br />\nwe don't? The real kicker nere is that by continuing to<br />\nencourage others to smoke, we sustain the social pressure<br />\nwhich makes it so difficult for us to quit. It all seems so<br />\ncomplicated....<br />\nEnougn. If there's a message hidden behind all this, I<br />\ncertainly can't decipher it. I'm still in favor of<br />\nlegalization, and there's no question that I'll continue to<br />\nindulge. Still, as I sit huddled ill my damp little single,<br />\nfilled with self-loatning as I fIll up another bong, my<br />\nthoughts drift back to the fall of 1971, when girls smoked<br />\nfreely and parties were neld outdoors. Because dammit,<br />\ngetting stoned still meant something then.<br />\nBill Newlin is also addicted to nicotine, caffeine,<br />\ncodeine, and various other substances too numerous to be<br />\nmentioned here.<br />\n<br />\n\fIrtre, \u2022<br />\nig<br />\n<br />\nBeing of the campus we were naturally heir to a certain<br />\ngood-natured elitism, which manifested from time to time<br />\nin the unhurried cocking of an ear or the nonchalant<br />\nbrush of a paw. If anything, we felt pity, not scornifor the<br />\nscores of apartment dogs who were daily led through the<br />\nquadrangles at such a somnambular pace by thier doting<br />\nStubby legged and leashed, they seemed to<br />\nmasters.<br />\nfear us and our freedom more than envy it -- their grassy<br />\nbrowsing always being accomplished with a bit of<br />\nill-concealed uneasiness. Caligula, in one of his more<br />\ncharitable moments(so rare towards the end) told us that<br />\nWe suffered no leashes because our young masters had not<br />\nyet accepted theirs: not yet felt the fear of things free<br />\nand unordered that weighed down so heavily upon their<br />\nelders. But Caligula was full of parables vague and ominous,<br />\nand often seemed to pronounce them only to himself and<br />\nthe night air, despairing that the rest of us, dullards all,<br />\nwould ever understand. Many times we did not, but that<br />\nonly increased our devotion, for we sensed that he had<br />\ngone far beyond us on a road that was both dark and<br />\nexciting at the same time. Since he was the first to travel<br />\nthat road he did not --could not-- see where it would lead.<br />\nI saw its bloody terminus that awful spring day and<br />\nthought to turn away from it forever, only to be so<br />\nnerversely curious now, in the quite moments of the night.<br />\nOne pronouncement of his, however, we had no<br />\ntrouble understanding. \"Man,\" he said from the<br />\nbeginning, \"is the cruelest of creatures. And that is<br />\nPrecisely why he rules.\" No, their cruelty was never in<br />\nquestion. It is something you learn early on about men,<br />\nand yet it never really ceases to amaze you, no matter<br />\nnow many seasons you have seen. Not cruelty to US, you<br />\nunderstand-- oh n it is never been anything but pets and<br />\ncooings for us, nothing but laughter and gentle hugs. The<br />\ncruelty they save for themselves, hoarding it to their<br />\nSpecies like misers. Caligula said that that was why they<br />\nkept us \u2014 that they desperately, pitifully, needed some<br />\nkind of living creature to love, and could find none among<br />\nthemselves. We rind to be there, Je said, or they would'surely<br />\ngo mad fromloneliness. True, the rooms and hallways of men<br />\nare always the same, permiated with that faint smell of<br />\nsadness, so a part of everything Man that nothing can<br />\nwash it away. The scent of every man may be different,<br />\nbut it is always variations on a somber theme;<br />\npermutations of the same, stifling loneliness.<br />\nHow can I explain what it is like? How can I describe<br />\nthe desolate odor of those beings? Loneliness is a<br />\nalways sets<br />\nsensation so alien to our kind that it<br />\nour nostrils to burning and raises our fur, though it has<br />\nbecome familiar beyond remembering. It is awful, it is<br />\nfrightening, and it eminates solely from Man. Even on the<br />\nfrestiest spring days, when Nature was bougn-bent wito<br />\nlove and life, the stench of loneliness could rise from their<br />\nassembled bodies basking in the sun and move like a<br />\nnoxious cloud over the freshly mown grass. It never left<br />\nt hem completely, even when they were happiest.<br />\nHappiness-- how rarely they knew its touch! Occasionally<br />\nWe came across a pair of lovers gently caressing on the<br />\ngrass,. lost in playful anticipation of intimacies to come,<br />\nand only a trace of it would remain. Such couples were<br />\nusually annoyed at the way we clustered about them<br />\nduririg those interludes, quitely resenting our wet noses<br />\nand playful growling; but they did not understand what an<br />\nawsome relief it was for us - to approach the creatures<br />\nwho loved us and fed us without being constantly<br />\nreminded of their crippled souls. I mention it because it<br />\nWas the loneliness of Man that drove Caligula to his own,<br />\nsolitary end.<br />\nWhen I remeber Caligula now, the picture is almost<br />\nalways nocturnal. That was when he was at his most<br />\nInspiring; black, sainy coat adding to the mystery he<br />\nProjected so well. It was his eyes that really made<br />\n\"lowers of us, though. Gleaming in the lamplight, you<br />\nknew that something intensely important was going on<br />\nbehind them, sometiiing that could be approached but<br />\nnever grasped, like a red hot coal on a grate. We followed<br />\nthose eyes on countless midnight forays, not really<br />\nUnderstanding what we were doing, but feeling a great<br />\nIndistinct purpose behind it all. Lurking outside lighted<br />\nw indows, we silently watched tile men. Caligula was<br />\nalway s closest to the glass, sometimes with his paws on<br />\nthe sill, breath clouding the pane. The sadness in dis eyes<br />\nas he wateched them made me fear for him terribly, and it<br />\n\"vas at those times that the sense of danger ceased to be<br />\nJust a vague shadow and actually emerged form the night<br />\nto crouoh menacingly behind the nearest bush. We<br />\nwatched them toil over books, microscopes, models, and<br />\nendless disarrayed papers. We watched as they laughed and<br />\nw_evt. We saw Ltem mating on beds, tables, cnairs, stacks<br />\n\u00b0st books, or \u201eressed<br />\ntiy against the wail. We saw them<br />\n`aress and beat each other. We looked on as scenes of<br />\nPassion, hatted, kindness, and calculation were performed<br />\n<br />\na<br />\nle<br />\nle<br />\nat<br />\na<br />\nly<br />\n<br />\nle<br />\n<br />\n)t<br />\n<br />\nrttfi'<br />\n\u2022 ,,,ttAkois.,<br />\n0,1.;\\<br />\n<br />\nnervously over his shoulder now and then to gaze down<br />\ntue hill at the yelllow lights of Lie dorms. He was too<br />\nconcerned witti the things of Man, too much occupied<br />\nwitti questions tuat didn't concern him, or any of our<br />\nkind. We are what we are and Man is what he is -- it is our<br />\nblessing and our curse. It is the way things are. Caliguia,<br />\nwoo had always been our leader, by definition the best<br />\nexploiter of things as they were, was now dissatisfied wit.<br />\nthe world -- and helpless to change it.<br />\nFrom then on his great change was apparent to<br />\neverybody. His enastizements became crueler and mvre<br />\nfrequent, hardly a day going by when one of us failed to feel<br />\nthe tig of his fangs for some minor offence. He forbade<br />\nus to beg our food and curtailed our play whenever iie<br />\ncould, oblivious to the, whispered rowls of protest.

Ttie men had ,Lealed all the<br />\ndry, brittle leaves into great mounds, and tile topmost<br />\nlayers were picking up and floating from pile to pile in a<br />\ngentle wind-borne exchange. It was a lazy day, but<br />\nCaligula ,had plans. When i first saw him, he was emerging<br />\nfrom one, of the buildings at a trot. Clettened in his<br />\npowerful jaws was a burning stick, ,iliered from some<br />\nfireplace inside, and it left a trail of grey swirling smoke as<br />\nhe ran. He was naliway to the fir.A pile of leaves wnen<br />\nwind changed abruptly, blowing the flame directly into<br />\nhis face. With a yei. of pain he momentarily dropped the<br />\nstick, only to \u201elea it up in the other side of his moutit and<br />\ncontinue on. , Again the gu.,ts came and again he was<br />\nburned, but, hardly seeming to care, he dragged, carried,<br />\nand rolled the flaming stick toward tne leaves with<br />\nmaniacal endurance. When the distance had finally been<br />\ntraversed, however, and the stick pushed under the<br />\nmound, it was all for 'taught because the flame had<br />\nalready died. He stood there looking at us, eyes burning<br />\nwith pain and humiliating, hairs singed and melted, even<br />\nthen silently voicing .115 proud contempt. He had tried at<br />\nleast, he seemed to say. He had tried...we tied not and<br />\nnever would. Caligula ALIA railed against the taboo of fire<br />\nand lost terribly, but on ins face I perceived a gaze of sad<br />\ntriumpn tnat made me jealous despite myself.<br />\nThat night I followed him out to inc open fields and<br />\ntried to talk with him, tried once and for all to<br />\nunderstand what was driving nim so violently and<br />\ninexorably from us. He called me a fool and worse,<br />\nabused me terribly, but all I could manage to feel was pity<br />\nfor his crushing sorrow. A sorrow that screamed from nis<br />\neyes louder than any of nis curses. After too long, I<br />\nturned away from his ravings and started back, only to be<br />\nstopped dead when I neard iiim whimper my name in a<br />\ntone I thought ne had lost forever.

The hallway is painted<br />\nhistory and the imprint of that instant you carry forever,<br />\nblack and we sit in the kitchen when the television<br />\nlike a set of dog tags. \"You won't believe this, but I've<br />\nblabbers; somebody passes a joint and Bert Parks crowns<br />\nnever done anything like this before.\"<br />\nMiss America and I'm going to scream.<br />\nA sardonic smile twists his lips. \"You really do live out<br />\nSometimes I think of my freshman year as a<br />\nin the sticks.\"<br />\nnine-month-long bout in a sickbed.

I never masturbated.<br />\nI laughed for five minutes when I heard that Andy<br />\nHartman, a wimp back home in Jersey, had enlisted, in<br />\nthe Air Force. I was high at the time, the cocktail hour<br />\nbetween my library work and dinner. Praise the Lord and<br />\npass the bong and every paragraph is getting shorter. And<br />\nshorter.<br />\nThe center is weakening. I wanted to get good grades; I<br />\nwanted to go to grad school and become a clinical<br />\npsychologist. I wanted to help people. But any hopes for<br />\ngrad school and a professional career were quashed in the<br />\nspring of my freshman year. To this day I have no inkling<br />\nof what happened to cause such a radical degeneration of<br />\nmy mental facilities. I remember working hard....Perhaps<br />\nJohns Hopkins demanded a more astute student than<br />\nmyself. A B performance on my finals converted the<br />\nmidterm Fs into terminal Cs. Did I dare tiptoe to the<br />\nbrink of a nervous collapse?<br />\nIn those late February days, my body trembled with<br />\nnervous laughter. Should I join a frat? Negative. Let's get<br />\nthe high before we go out partying. That's the only way I<br />\ncan face the. I only remember the scattered fragments;<br />\nthe process is like picking up pieces of a broken glass. At<br />\nlunch I choke on eggplant parmesan and scare poor Bob<br />\nhalf to death. I laugh hysterically at Don Knotts,\"Brush<br />\nyour dentist twice a day and visit your teeth once a year.\"<br />\nLosing control of my faci.<br />\nSomehow I muster the strength to buck up. The viral<br />\ninfection in my brain has passed, and I recover intime to<br />\nsave my academic skin. I can not express the desperation I<br />\nfelt during that time, the empty confusion behavioral<br />\npsychologists call learned helplessness.<br />\nI must regain my perspective.- Years from now I<br />\nsuppose laughter will come easily upon memories of my<br />\nnaivete and inexperience. The road to tragedy is paved<br />\nwith comedy, but now at the end of my fourth and final<br />\nyear at Hopkins, I feel nothing but sadness. I should have<br />\ngone to the White House for help, but I was too cocksure<br />\nand smart-assed to admit the problem. Passivity is an<br />\naddictive failure, and those were the days of wine and<br />\nneurosis. Perhaps I'm blowing this miniscule malaise out<br />\nof proportion\u2014there's nothing more boring than the<br />\nteary-eyed tale of a troubled adolescent. Yet, my entire<br />\nfuture was altered by this mental breakdown. A 1.76<br />\naverage can never be saved; graduate work and a<br />\nprofessional career just weren't in the cards the fates had<br />\ndealt.<br />\nI can't write about pain anymore. The happiest<br />\nmoment in my freshman year was when I handed in the<br />\nkey to my room and then, seeing my father waving from<br />\nthe packed car, I walk out, like maddop, Englishmen, and<br />\nHopkins students, into the midday sun.<br />\n<br />\nThe Blessed<br />\nRage<br />\nOh! Blessed rage for order, pale Rarnon the maker's rage<br />\nto order words of the sea, words of the fragrant portal,<br />\ndirty-stained, and of ourselves and of our origins, in<br />\nghostlier demarcations, keener sounds, Wallace Stevens,<br />\n\"The Idea of Order at Key West.\"<br />\nUsually I don't drink in the afternoon but today<br />\nmake an exception. I've just learned that th brillo-haired<br />\nEnglish TA will flunk me because I didn't bother to<br />\nattend his horrific conference sections. Of course I<br />\nhanded in some of the papers late, but I did all of them<br />\nand hell, I'm only taking the course pass-fail. But that<br />\ncesspool-breathed grad student has taken it upon himself<br />\nto create his own precious little flunkie in his first (and<br />\nhopefully,last) teaching position. Whatever happened to<br />\nthe solidarity of students? Comrade, you're only a few<br />\nyears older so why can't we unite to fight the capitalistic<br />\noppression so rampant in American academics?<br />\nI hate studying and grades. Yet here I am proposing to<br />\ntell the story of my academic career. What a longtwo<br />\nyears it has been since I resolved to exterminate that<br />\ntermite grad student if I should come up three credits<br />\nshort of graduation. Johns Hopkins just isn't the place for<br />\nthe pre-nothing I became after my freshman year. I<br />\nhonestly believe the system itself is not all that bad; the<br />\nfault, dear students, lies not in the stars but in ourselves.<br />\nLet's face it\u2014Hopkins would be great if it wasn't for<br />\nthose greedy, throaty, nerdy pre-people that fill the<br />\nstudent Directory.<br />\n<br />\n\fIf I sound bitter that's because I am. The<br />\npre-professional competition at Hopkins ruins the college<br />\nexperience for quixotic derelicts like myself who see<br />\nsimple valor in the simple absorption of ideas, and honor<br />\nwhatsoever in rubbing noses against the shriveled buttocks<br />\nof aged professors. Grades are nefarious symbols, the<br />\nmere indicators of how well the eager pupil has mastered<br />\nthe tricks of the academic trade. I wish I could name<br />\nnames here to prove my unbiased contention that<br />\nintelligence is no correlate to good grades, but the<br />\nstringent laws oflibel prevent me from publicly debunking<br />\nsuch supnosedlv respectable people.<br />\nSome of my courses have been soiled by this horde of<br />\ngreedy academical locusts. In an upper-levelpsychology<br />\ncourse reputed to be gutsville, I felt so ashamed at my<br />\nfellow students' nagging that I almost went up to the<br />\nprofessor and apologized for their infantile whims. They<br />\nberated the poor professor needlesslywith the pickiest of<br />\nexam details, and anyone with the least bit of cool knew<br />\nthe A was well in the bag. Occasionally, when my nearly<br />\nimpeccable defenses are at their weakest, my bitterness<br />\nbubbles over into amercilessly delivered tirade against my<br />\nbest friends (innocent though they may be). I call these<br />\nfine people misers, leeches, lechers, vermin and varmints.<br />\nAfterwards I cower in profuse apologies for my<br />\nmisanthropicabuse. I should be more tolerant of those<br />\nunfortunate enough to believe the ersatz side of<br />\neducation. Of course pity mixes with anger and disgust<br />\nwhen I regard the few who still cling to a child's ocncept<br />\nof education, that knowledge is a quantitative function, a<br />\ntangible. Even sadder are those who carry this demented<br />\nphilosophy over to the humanities; for them there really<br />\nis no hope. As a leaving senior, I can only say that I look<br />\nat you all. sympathetically, while my transcript gently<br />\nweeps. Naturally the question arises as to the purpose of<br />\na college education. At Homewood the answer is very<br />\nsimple; Hopkins is nothing more than a glorified liberal<br />\nprep school, readying its students for the big casino of<br />\nGrad school. I suppose there once were some halycon<br />\ndays when a mere B.A. from Hopkins waas worth<br />\nsomething in the world. \"There goes a Hopkins man,\"<br />\nthey whisper in hushed reverence. Now a B.A.in Social<br />\nand Behavioral Science will get you ,along with fifty cents,<br />\na ride on the New York subway.<br />\nSometimes I find it hard to understand that peculiar<br />\npersonality quirk that allows one to tolerate tie four<br />\nmore years in a classroom after high school. Quite<br />\nobviously these gluttons have never matured and now<br />\nthey're afraid of what might lurk outside the academic<br />\ncocoon. The teacher is a surrogate parent; you realized<br />\nthat in your first crawl into kindergarden and the same<br />\nPsychological relationship was maintained, either<br />\nconsciously or unconsciously, for the next twenty years.<br />\nAt darkest moments,'when the grim face of failure smiles<br />\nalluringly, I suddenly have more admiration for those<br />\nroughnecks back home in Jersey who just barely<br />\ngraduated from high school and now have jobs, menial by<br />\nour sophisticated Hopkins standards, Inumping gas ,<br />\nsurveying farmlands, etc. More importantly, however,<br />\nadmire their courage to be independent, to take that<br />\nProverbial giant step into what we cushioned academic<br />\nPansies call cruel reality.<br />\nIt is at moments like this (6:47 p.m. Tuesday, May 15,<br />\n1976) in the Rat licking the foam off the inside of a beer<br />\nmug that I regret not possessing the gumption or talent to<br />\nbecome an authentic renegade. The merry vagabond I<br />\nChopping wood in an Oregon commune and then coming<br />\nhome with the kindling for mu kindred, little Garth a<br />\nsuckling at my lactescent soulmate, the spiritual outrigger<br />\nwho shares my straw mattress.Of course I am hardly<br />\nstrong enough to lift an axe, let alone fell the mighty trees<br />\nmy father probably planted back in '37 as a member of<br />\nthe CCC, a touch of irony only approaching that of the<br />\nrole Steven Muller played in the handling of the militant<br />\ntakeover of Willard Straight Hall in Cornell in 1968 wile<br />\nmy brother played and drank gin in his dorm room and<br />\neventually flunked out, and now Steven Muller refuses to<br />\neven say hello at a reception. I shouldn't write when the<br />\nbubbly gets the better of me; the ideas are spiced with<br />\nbrilliance (just as mashed potatoes are spiked with<br />\nSaltpeter at exclusive prep schools) but lack organization<br />\nand flex unrealistically with the illogic of emotions. I<br />\nmust return to more serious matters.<br />\nMY my senior year was the Pfeffer case, which<br />\nquestioned the value of a profejmr's teaching ability. The<br />\nstudents raised their puny voicei muted protest, but<br />\nalas to no avail. Suddenly students became aware of the<br />\nfact that research, not teaching, is emphasized among the<br />\nranks at Hopkins. These complaints have, at most, hollow<br />\nValidity The quality of teaching at this University will<br />\nnever improve unless the students tnemselves take a more<br />\nactive interest in learning and not in getting good grades<br />\nUnless professors are convinced that their pupils are truly<br />\ninterested in learning, there is absolutely no reason for<br />\n<br />\ndotoN Japuual\"<br />\n<br />\nMore Tristes<br />\n<br />\nthem to care about callous youth who exploit tile faculty<br />\nfor their own advancement. The nearsightedness of youth<br />\ndoes not see the fact that the famed Hopkins coolness is<br />\nperfect training for the type of rigorous academics the<br />\nmajority will face in grad school. Hopkins' dedication to<br />\nresearch is publicized to the point of boredom so that we<br />\nshould have known before we came what was in store.<br />\nI can not believe my bitterness. Selfishly I repine in my<br />\nown peculiar vitriolic way against the whole of the<br />\nHopkins student body, the majority of whom I haven't<br />\neven met. I think I know the source of my anger. Fiinally,<br />\nnow in the fast-fading twilight of my days here, I realize<br />\nthat 1 am only to blame for iii,' relative failure at<br />\nHopkins. It's easier, psychologically and physically, to<br />\nblame the external factors rather than admit the truth and<br />\none's own failures. As the old guidance counselor cliche<br />\ngoes, I just didn't apply myself after that disastrous<br />\nfreshman year. Sure, I maintained a B average, but my<br />\nheart and mind were far removed from the effort. I will<br />\nhave gotten no tangible rewards from my college career<br />\nsave for the piece of sheepskin Dr. Muller hands to me.<br />\nHas the ilard-earned and lent money been wasted by this<br />\nbag of lazybones? I don't know; only the future will tell.<br />\nMy eyelids are beginning to sag under the weight of all<br />\nthe beer. It is time to go home now, nerhaps liave some<br />\nsupper, and then sleep off the drunk. I walk slowly across<br />\nthe campus as the sun sets behind Hampden and the<br />\nlengthening shadows stretch across the glory that is<br />\nHopkins.<br />\n<br />\nIn the Crease<br />\nAt the end of it all Frank Merriwell tells the villainous<br />\nHopkins man, \"I don't know how you happened to be<br />\nchosen the captain of the Hopkins team. You can play<br />\nlacrosse, but you are a dirty fellow.\"<br />\nBob Scott<br />\nLacrosse<br />\n<br />\nBut I still wish there were something less painful and<br />\nquicker than looking for love at a Notre Dame mixer.<br />\nAnonymous<br />\nA little after-dinner coitus does much to ease digestion,<br />\nbut unfortunately I've never had the chance to test this<br />\norgiastic antacid. I'm a real die-hardsadsack. At the end<br />\nof my sophomore year, I sat down and set th<br />\ne<br />\nobjectives I wished to accomplish during the remainder of<br />\nmy Hopkins years. In reverseorder of importance: a) to be<br />\neditor of the News-Letter, b) to be captain of the golf<br />\nteam, and c) to get laid. Now that it's time to divvy up<br />\nthe score, I realize that two out of three ain't bad.<br />\nI know that I'm not the most sociable gent to stalk the<br />\ndance floor. To be perfectly truthful, I'm a rather dull<br />\nblade who doesn't cut a sharp figure in public. The<br />\nhighlight of the social season back home was when the<br />\nwhole family packed into the Hupmobile for the fifty<br />\nmile drive to the annual Perkasie Firemen's Day Parade,<br />\nguzzled beer all afternoon, and then belched all the way<br />\nhome. As the attentive reader will readily recall, I arrived<br />\nat palatial Homewood with visions of becoming a dashing<br />\nrogue, in language more attuned to the customs and<br />\nmanners of the natives, a stud. Hopkins seemed such a<br />\nsocially obtuse oblivion that I reckoned I could pull off<br />\nthe ruse. The scheme was a blunder; I miscalculated my<br />\nfellow inmates' intentions.They too possessed the<br />\ndispositions of dolts and likewise formulated an identical<br />\ntrategy of masquerade. Appearances being merely<br />\n:dative, circumstances soon relegated me to the smelly pit<br />\nof solitude to which as a writer I have grown accustomed.<br />\nI've always defended the sparse social life at Hopkins as<br />\npreparation for the relentless boredom of maturity,<br />\ngranted that such an argument is nothing more than an<br />\nacute rationalization for a dingus like myself. Hopkins<br />\ndoes not coddle its students, which is too bad because<br />\nso 'many of them seem to need that exact kind<br />\noftreatment. I never realized until I came to Hopkins how<br />\nmany funny-looking people there were in the world.11ow<br />\nclearly one can see the pain of a ravaged adolescence<br />\n, etched upon their faces.

Red six on black<br />\nSeven.<br />\nA smooth spring breeze oozed through the screen. In<br />\nthe distance there was laughter and Westerly turned up<br />\nthe radio to cover the noise. He scruffed; the song was<br />\n\"Nowhere Man,\" and that's precisely what Westerly<br />\nthought of nimself that early May night. Here he was, a<br />\nyoung man about to graduate from the esteemed Johns<br />\nHopkins University with 3.23 average and what does he<br />\nhave to show for ins efforts? Westerly has no job, the<br />\ndemand for Social Relations majors being what it is; he<br />\ncould have gone to grad school if he had wanted to.<br />\nWesterly felt selfishly unloved and unwanted. He felt very<br />\ninsignificant, a speck of dust in the cosmic wind, to fall<br />\nback on a song on tile radio now. There's no place for the<br />\nred nine.<br />\nWesterly once had a lover. She was in one of his<br />\nseminars and they got to talking one day in the reserrve<br />\nroom. They ended u going to the movies that weekend<br />\nand he kissed her goodnight was before her door. He<br />\ndidn't particularly feel like kissing her, but of course he<br />\ndidn't ven know how he should feel.<br />\nWesterly had few girlfriends before this: He could never<br />\nexpress his love of solitude, yet he knew he was lonely<br />\nand needed someone. He wanted to take a girl's hand in<br />\nhis, or, even better, slip his arm around her wz.dst and<br />\nstroll across campus together to publicly declare their<br />\nyouth and affection. Yet, with Sally or any other girl, he<br />\ncould never bring himself to do any of this. Four years of<br />\nsocial science had distanced him from iiimself in a way lie<br />\ndidn't understand. He felt alien to himself. Things refused<br />\nto be simple for Westerly. He thought he was either gifted<br />\nor cursed, or a combination of the two.<br />\nBefore Sally nobody seemed to care for him in any but<br />\na superficilial way. They merely liked him as a nice guy<br />\nwhich was fine because he was incapable of feeling a deep<br />\npassion. Or so he thought. Sally lost his virginity. The<br />\nepisode seemed too commonplace to be special yet this is<br />\ntheway Westerly remembers it, as he does almost every<br />\nnight, in that space of time before turning out hte lights<br />\nand falling asleep. After a movie, they went to the Rat<br />\nand shared two pitchers of beer. They laughed and talked<br />\nand finally straggled back to her apartment when the<br />\nbartender came and shooed them away at closing time.<br />\nFor a time they talked on her couch, holding hands, then<br />\nshe disappeared and reappeared in her nightgown. Even<br />\nWesterly knew what this meant, and he followed her into<br />\nher room, and stripped, and after that first anxious<br />\nlovemaking, they clung together like two sheep in a storm<br />\nand stayed that way until the light of dawn came to save<br />\ntheir souls.<br />\n<br />\nTristesopkins<br />\nH<br />\n<br />\nMean motherfuckers yes we are and we mean business.<br />\nWhen a blue jay eats a Monarch butterfly, he goes<br />\nYeah manman, somebody get John.

Perhaps I<br />\nam an idealist, but I believe, that if the staff of the<br />\nNewletter would allow a viable channel for student<br />\nopinion and ideas, not only could the Hopkins<br />\ncommunity expand its narrow perspective, but that<br />\nstudents would rise to the occation and even write for the<br />\nNewletter!<br />\nIn concluding this letter, there are a few questions that<br />\nmust be asked. For whom is the Johns Hopkins<br />\nNewsletter written? By whom is it written? Who's opinion<br />\ndoes the Newsletter represent? Are the ideas and opinions<br />\nof students w/in this University worthwhile publishing<br />\nmaterial? Should the Newletter only concern itself with<br />\nthe ideas, and opinions which pertain to the 'narrow<br />\nscope of this university? Or, should it welcome ideas,<br />\nopinion, and that relates to other aspects of tnis world? If<br />\nwe do not concern ourselves with the outside world, what<br />\nkind of educational experience are we really allowing<br />\nourselves?<br />\nJenny Fox<br />\nTo the Editor: The Board of Intramural Athletics<br />\ntakes great exception to the accusations perpetrated in<br />\nlast Friday's Editorial and Letter to the Editor. The<br />\nclaims of discrimination against females are just as<br />\nPreposterous now as they were four years ago, when<br />\nwomen first applied and were accepted onto the BIA,<br />\nwhich was before varsity women's sports ever existed. It is<br />\nunfortunate that the editorial staff chose to indulge again<br />\nin the practice of irresponsible journalism by blindly<br />\nparroting the cornplaints of one<br />\nmis-informed<br />\nindividual about the program that involves more students<br />\nthan any other on campus. Now is a good time to set toe<br />\nrecord straight point by point.<br />\nIn response to the over-generalization that there \"are<br />\ncurrently no BIA sports for women,\" it sliould be noted<br />\nthat EVERY intramural event, with the possible<br />\nexception of wrestling, is open to coed participation. This<br />\nis explicitly stated in the BIA Bylaws as well as the rules<br />\nfor each sport (copies available upon . request). In<br />\naddition, all publicity announcements include the<br />\nstatement-open to all undergraduates.<br />\nBut have women been asked directly? The answer is<br />\nyes. In fact, coed volleyball failed during last term<br />\nbecause most teams could not fulfill the mandatory<br />\ntwo-girl per team requirement. As far as tile freshmen are<br />\nconcerned, the housemasters and the athletic reps of all<br />\ndorms, including Adams and Baker, nave gotten every<br />\nannouncement and scandal sheet in their mailboxes and<br />\nStill not a peep out of them.<br />\nCould it be that the girls need separate events because<br />\nthey cannot compete fairly against guys? This seems<br />\n<br />\nextremely unlikely in cases such as the. bike race, tennis,<br />\nbilliards, swimming, badminton, golf and softball. In fact,<br />\nit is only in football, baseball and lacrosse that women<br />\nhave a physical or ability disadvantage. For this reason, it<br />\nwas quite disappointing that when a special survey was<br />\nmade last fall to determine interest in :gymnastics, a sport<br />\nin which women usually excel, only two responses were<br />\nreceived. Only last year there was a soccer team entered<br />\nthat was composed entirely of women.<br />\nThe BIA exists to provide opportunities for interested<br />\nstudents to participate. It cannot go out recruiting people<br />\nall the time to form teams. By way of example, graduate<br />\nstudents are generally excluded from BIA events because<br />\nof age and skill differences. This year, many grad students<br />\nasked to play in BIA basketball. Since enough graduates<br />\nshowed interest by forming their own teams, there was set<br />\nup a Graduate League, complete with playoffs. On the<br />\nother hand, not a single Hopkins woman, even though<br />\nfully eligible from the start, ever expressed interest in<br />\nplaying intramural ball.<br />\nActually, it would be quite surprising to find many girls<br />\nplaying intramurals when the varsity women's program is<br />\nstruggling to improve. As claimed in the letter last Friday,<br />\n\"given the large number of women who try out for varsity<br />\nsports.\"the field hockey and basketball teams did not<br />\nhave enough members at their practices to hold full<br />\nscrimmages. Other sports, fielding smaller teams, must<br />\nrely on freshmen many of whom do not return to play for<br />\na second year, and a small core of women who play two<br />\nor more sports. .<br />\nThis doesn't alter the fact that not only are there<br />\npresently many BIA sports for women, but there have<br />\nbeen numerrous attempts in the past to arouse interest,<br />\nand there will be even more planned for the future. Next<br />\nyear's officers are already looking forward to promoting<br />\nwomen's entries, setting up girl's leagues, and improving<br />\nworking relations with the Coordinator of Women's<br />\nAthletics.<br />\nIt remains totally unexplained, however, why this has<br />\nnot been done in the past. Especially since the BIA has<br />\nhad two female members each of the past two years, and<br />\none for two years before that. Amazingly enough, every<br />\ngirl that has applied has professed to have contacts with<br />\nmany interested women, and the desire to foster women's<br />\nparticipation. Yet over the last four years, these women<br />\nhave accomplished relatively little to further their cause.<br />\nThey have been organizing the events, but they need<br />\nothers to participate.<br />\nNext year, the president should no longer suffer this<br />\nsupposed \"lack of support from his fellow board<br />\nmembers.\" Out of 13 applicants to next year's BIA, four<br />\nwere women; that is 30%. There were three women (30%)<br />\namong the 10 new-members selected.

These figures compare favorably to the<br />\nundergraduate female population, but far surpasses tne<br />\nproportion of females in intercollegiate athletics. With<br />\nresults such as these, the selection proceedings are<br />\ncertainly not biased, or politically motivated.<br />\nIn fact, fraternity members will be in the minority on<br />\nnext year's Board, further weakening the influence they<br />\nwield over intramural policy. In the past, the BIA has<br />\nbeen very attentive to the needs of dorms and frats<br />\nbecause intramural sports were sometimes the only<br />\nactivities keeping them together. During Lie past two<br />\nyears, however, there has been a noticeable emphasis on<br />\nparticipation by independents. The results have been so<br />\npromising that an Indep league was established this year<br />\nand trophy points awarded, while next year will probably<br />\nsee the institution of a year-long indep trophy.<br />\nIndependent entries have risen dramatically tills year,<br />\nover last year's unprecedented turnout football teams<br />\nwent from 6 to 7, baseball entries increased from 20 to<br />\n25, softball jumped from 1 to 16, and lacrosse from 8 to<br />\n10. Most smaller sports were equally well attended,<br />\nespecially tennis.<br />\nTo achieve turnouts such as tilese, there must have<br />\nbeen some sort of publicity. Articles have appeared in this<br />\npublication regularly and announcements are mailed and<br />\nposted campus-wide. Admittedly there is room for<br />\nimprovement in any organization's publicity on this<br />\ncampus. The BIA is again requesting funding for a 24-hour<br />\nrecorded message phone line to provide B1A's news<br />\nwhenever needed, which was turned down last fall.<br />\nNevertheless, publicity must be somewhat effective if 400<br />\npeople turn out for six weeks of basketball alone, when<br />\nthe Student Council can just barely find 25% of the<br />\nstudent body to take five minutes to vote. Besides, if so<br />\nmany people disapprove of the way the BIA is run, mere<br />\nshould have been many more applicants. As it were, more<br />\npeople applied for membership on the BIA than ran for<br />\nSC Office!?<br />\nIn conclusion, it should be apparent taat tile BIA is<br />\nextremely biased in its dedication to providing a widely<br />\nvaried program of intramural sports to as many students<br />\nas possible. Granted there are sometimes restrictions and<br />\nmistakes and maybe even less than perfectioQ. At least tile<br />\nBoard's aware of this and strives to minimize it. Public<br />\nsmear editorials and sensationalization of myopic<br />\nopinions in the News-Letter will achieve little, for<br />\nunbeknowns to the editors, the students at Hopkins know<br />\nwhat the Board of Intramural Athletics has gotten done.<br />\nSincerely,<br />\nAudrey Zettick<br />\nPhillip Gilly<br />\n<br />\nM.D./D.V.M.

Yet,<br />\nmore finportantly, the simple reality that I, a student at<br />\nJohns Hopkins University, had written something wnich<br />\nhad seemed to me to be relevant to the student body,and<br />\nthat 1, again a student at Hopkins nad risen out of my<br />\nown, and general campus, apathy, to take a personal stand<br />\non this issue, should entitle me to the printing of my<br />\nartical without creating too much hardship.<br /><br />\ntheir natural \"literary genius\" which, of course, was<br />\nentirely capable of creating a newspaper masterpeice on<br />\nits own.<br />\nAlthough I was \"lucky\" enough, after the general<br />\ncorrections, rewording, and threats of'rewriting, to get the<br />\neditors' approval for publication, there was still the<br />\nadmonition that there might not be enough space in I his<br />\nissue to include my article or that further editing might<br />\noccur. Naturally, when I returned the next day, I<br />\nfound,<br />\nto the editors' complete \"sorrow\", that were was no<br />\nroom within the Newsletter for my article that week.<br />\nWhat I later learned was that the editor nad deemed my<br />\n,article irrelevent to 'campus news since it .did not deal<br />\ndirectly with toe island of Johns Hopkins (a (reatful<br />\nDead Concert was relevent!).

Today, students have replaced this eagerness by<br />\na new attitude to succeed--the need for above-average<br />\ngrades. This new attitude makes for scholarly work that is<br />\nadmirable, but work for a different reason. At one time,<br />\nthe education itself was most important. Now, the grades<br />\nreceived while being educated are of primary concern.<br />\nThis new attitude was caused in many ways by the<br />\nstudents themselves, but other factors have also made for<br />\nthe change. The greatest cause of this change came from<br />\nthe graduate institutions requirement of near perfection<br />\nfor admittance. A student cannot help but be affected by<br />\nthis dread of rejection at such an early stage in life. Yet<br />\nStill, the students themselves further alter the past<br />\neducational philosophy. Students make course selections<br />\noften solely on the ease with which one can receive an A.<br />\nStudents avoid courses that might well interest tilem, and<br />\nthe student's own new attitudes has drawn him away<br />\nfrom the fundamental purpose of education. Perhaps<br />\nthe future was more certain for a hard-working student a<br />\ndecade ago, but the improvement ofthe mind still<br />\nmotivated students to lear . Today's student often ends<br />\nfour years of undergraduate study with a dark future<br />\nahead, even after studying hard. We cannot change the<br />\nbitter competition wat admission to graduate school<br />\nbrings out, but perhaps a student's ideals of success can be<br />\nreevaluated. Success doesnot have to be measured by the<br />\nA's received so that one can be admitted to graduate<br />\nschool, but by the knowledge an undergraduate has<br />\ngained. In other words, what students of a decade ago<br />\ntook for granted; that is, eagerness, fervor, and a desire to<br />\nearn, tne students of today should reinstill.<br /><br />\nSenior Class president Frank Faillace hard at work<br /><br />\nPreMeds<br />\nOver sixty per cent of the Hopkins students who<br />\napplied to medical schools were accepted, according to a<br />\nreport presented by Dr. John Gryder, chairman of tile<br />\npre-medical recommendations committee, Tuesday night.<br />\nA statistical breakdown of acceptances according to<br />\nGPA showed that 62% of those that applied to medical<br />\nschool from the class of '77 were accepted. 19% of tilose<br />\napplicants with GPA's below 3.0 were granted admission.<br />\n31% of those applying with GPA's between 3.0 and 3.2<br />\nwere accepted. There was 47% acceptance of those with<br />\naverages between 3.2 and 3.4, 76% acceptance with<br />\naverages between 3.4 and 3.6, and 87% acceptance with<br />\naverages between 3.6 and 3.8. 100% of those with averages<br />\nbetween 3.8 and 4.0 were granted admission. These<br />\nfigures have not been corrected for those accepted to the<br />\n2-5 program or for early graduates accepted to medical<br />\nschool without their college degrees. Dr. Gryder<br />\nemphasized that comparison of acceptance rates between<br />\ncolleges may be misleading. Schools compile their<br />\nstatistical data differently, so meaningful comparisons<br />\ncannot be made until the details of the statistical analysis<br />\nare known.<br />\nTwo main criteria used by medical schools in evaluating<br />\napplications are grade averages and MCAT .scores.

It's just that my time here at JHU is finally<br />\ndrawing to a close, and frankly I'm damn gl ad of it.<br />\nI remember back when I was a sophomore, and we<br />\nwere planning the Centennial issue of the N-L. The idea<br />\ncame up to nave some of the more famous alumni of the<br />\npaper write articies about their days on the paper. It was<br />\nimmediately dismissed on tile grounds that contacting<br />\nsuch luminaries as Russell Baker and requesting their<br />\nservices would be utterly futile. At the time I couldn't<br />\nunderstand why someone like Russell Baker wouldn't be<br />\nthrilled at the prospect of recounting his college days, but<br />\nas my term at this University passed, I began to.<br />\nunderstand: College lias but one purpose. Getting out.<br />\nPerhaps the allusion to RussellBaker may be somewhat<br />\npresumptious; after all, it seems fairly doubtful that I will<br />\nsomeday be an editorial writer for the New York Times.<br />\nBut it's easy to see how distance and bitterness could<br />\nfilter in.<br />\nThis past semester, I have been all but in abstensia from.<br />\nmany of my classes, and campus life in general. A large<br />\nmeasure of this was due to the fact that in addition to the<br />\njob I have had for the past three years in Towson, I have<br />\nbeen working as the music editor for The ity Paper. I am<br />\nbecoming a professional journalist, and frankly, classes are<br />\nbecoming irrelevant.<br />\nI hesitate to say that, though, because it often seems<br />\nthat it's not so much what I'm being taught is out of place<br />\nbut rather that it's my fellow students who seem out of<br />\nstep with reality. A few weeks ago, I had a terrible dream<br />\nthat Hopkins had turned into a grotesquely large high<br />\nschool. I wound up spending most of my time running<br /><br />\ninto hall monitors (who curiously resemble our student<br />\ngovernment functionaries), wiio wouldn't believe me<br />\nwhen I told them that they couldn't do anything to me<br />\nbecause I had graduated. I wound up being given<br />\ndetention, and woke up as I was being hauled screaming<br />\nto the graduate stacks on D level.<br />\nOf course, it's easy to say that considering my dealings<br />\nwith student government functionaries over the past four<br />\nyears it's a wonder I'm not a total paranoid, but<br />\nnonetheless, the point stands: you Hoppies then to take<br />\nyour little microcosm far too seriously. Hey, don't get me<br />\nwrong -- this is no high-horse speech. I've been just as<br />\nguilty in my time as the worst of you. But I've seen tile<br />\nreal world, and, uh, this ain't it....<br />\nIn all fairness, the blame should be realistically<br />\napproportioned, and this particular delusion is obviously<br />\none that nas emanated from the top of our little social<br />\nsystem. It's easy to see how the faculty of a research<br />\noriented University such as ours (didja catch Uncle<br />\nStevie's little spiel in the Sun the other night?) would<br />\ntend to nurture an intellectual insularity, and many<br />\nprofessors, assistant professors, grad students and lab<br />\nassistants feel almost righteous in their assertion that<br />\nHopkins is both the best and the only of all possible<br />\nworlds.<br />\nAnd why shouldn't they? I mean, that is wilat they're<br />\ngetting paid for. All I ask is, hey! keep in mind that there<br />\nare those of us who believe that there is life beyond the<br />\nlibraries and laboratories. I had an instructor once who<br />\ntold me that I would be best advised to forsake my<br />\ninvolvements with music and journalism and devote my<br />\ntime to his subject, which was Roman Imperial<br />\ngovernment. Had I been the sarcastic sort, I could have<br />\npointed out to him that his devotion to tne glory days of<br />\nRome had yet to earn nim a doctorate, let alone a<br />\nprofessorship, but instead I stumbled out of his office,<br />\nnumbly mumbling \"fuck you\" under my breatn.<br />\nI did pass his course (barely), but I also kept up my<br />\nwork in those secular fields he so disdained. To date, my<br />\ntravails in music and journalism have earned me a<br />\nsignificant portion of my income in addition to the thrill<br /><br />\nof becoming published in local arid national organs of the<br />\npress, while on the other hand my knowledge of the inner<br />\nworkings of Imperial Rome has only come into use when<br />\nwatching 1 Claudius on tv.<br />\nSo why, you may ask, have I spent my last four years<br />\nand several thousand dollars (many of wnich I could not<br />\na fford) to stay on at this particular station of Academic<br />\nisolationism? Because, at its best, Hopkins is still the best<br />\nschool I could 'lave chosen, and certainly tile only one I<br />\nwould go to if I had to do it all over again. Why? Because<br />\ndespite the occasional stupidities of the place, they have<br />\nprovided me with an excellent liberal arts education \\voile<br />\nat the same time leaving me enough iilone that I could not<br />\nonly decide for myself how to mink und what to do, but<br />\nto excel at bob'.<br />\nPerhaps that's wag galls me the most, that tiiis is such<br />\nan excellent place, and yet it still is riddled wit,'<br />\nproblems. I feel that the enormous tuition, nowever much'<br />\nI may nave suffered to scrape it together (yes, me; my<br />\neducation has been self-funded since my sophomore<br />\nyear), was somehow worth it; and yet like tne owner of a<br />\nlarge and expensive car, I fed that I have the right to be<br />\nincensed with even the tiniest flaws. Because, dLimmit, it<br />\nmeans too mum to just slough it off....<br />\nYean, well, enough passion for one article. I'm leaving<br />\nHopkins in a few months, and when I finally leave<br />\nBaltimore, I doubt I will return to Homewood. I may<br />\nkeep in touch with tire few faculty members whom I have<br />\ncome to admire, but the rest of my time will be devoted<br />\nto becoming a career journalist and ignoring letters asking<br />\ncontributions to the alumni funds. They managed to get<br />\nmy tuition (at least, so far they have) -- that will probably<br />\nbe it.<br />\nSo farewell, JHU.

Too often. it is true, undergraduate<br />\n,education takes a back seat to graduate study and<br />\nresearch. I am informed that Daniel Coit Gilman's grand<br />\nscheme was to found an undergraduate institution<br /><br />\njennifer bishop<br /><br />\nMonkey Business<br /><br />\nBy David Chesanow<br />\nuniquely designed to forge capable scholars for graduate<br />\nstudy. But the \"best laid schemes\" we all know,somehow<br />\nget screwed up. Either the bulk of emphasis is wrongly<br />\ndiverted away from undergraduate instruction, or efforts<br />\nto remedy the situation by introducing \"innovative\"<br />\nprgrams are shoddy or haphazard. Labeled<br />\n\"experimental\" in order to silence their crtics, and then<br />\nexpected to succeed. So what's the point in balancing the<br />\nbudget, or keeping tuition increases minimal, when that<br />\nlittle mutant bastard called Mediocrity squeezes out some<br />\nother crack in the basement moulding. You can create as.<br />\nmany \"innovative\" )legree programs as there were hairs<br />\non Dainel Gilman's hoary head, but .teaching suffers all<br />\nthe same, and though we look with hope to the upcoming<br />\nCurriculum Review to help set things right, it is<br />\ndiscouraging that we have had to wait so long.<br />\nWhat does all this mean in terms of student<br />\nparticipation in the decision-making process. It means the<br />\nstruggle (not to sound melodramatic) is all uphill. The<br />\ncredibility of the Student Council as a means of<br />\npromulgating the student viewpoint has always been<br /><br />\nquestioned in all sectors of the Hopkins community. Most<br />\ndistressing, however, is that this doubt is a consequence of<br />\nthe rampant apathy that characterizes the students<br />\nthemselves. A year ago, I contended that the source of the<br />\nCouncil's power is the support of the student body. I<br />\nsupport the assertion all the more vehemently now. The<br />\nStudent Council will be consigned to impotence<br />\nunless<br />\nthe students at large express their interest, lend<br />\na hand,<br />\nand stand behind it. Yet in the referendum on<br />\nthe<br />\nStudent Body Constitution, the 25% voting required<br />\nto<br />\nvalidate the results was barely attained. And the<br />\nCounc,i1<br />\nis till viewed as a clique of power hungry pllitical<br />\nbosses<br />\nout to serve no one but themselves. What<br />\nstudents fail to<br />\nrealize is that Council members are not servants,<br />\nbut<br />\nstudents, elected by other students to further<br />\ntlieir<br />\ncollective interests. Unlike tl_eir counterparts at various<br />\nother universities, they receive neither academic credit<br />\nnor salary, yet they are still the target of petty and<br />\nunfounded derision. And all the while, interest lags, and<br />\nlittle gets done. Only when c. crisis impends do<br />\nstudents<br />\nsnap to and mobilize. Amidst the Calendar<br />\nChange<br />\ncontroversy last year, a placard was slung from the<br />\nstaue<br />\nof William Welch before Shriver Hall. It read<br />\n\"What does<br />\nMuller really want?\" More pressing still, what<br />\ndo the<br />\nstudents really want?

We used to do it absolutely nonstop; first<br />\nthing in the morning, between classes, after lunch, before<br />\nrunning, after dinner and so on tnrough the nignt. We<br />\nnever did any work, and we never felt guilty about it.<br />\neither. As far as we were concerned, that's what wewere<br />\nthere for - blowing dope and having a good time.<br />\nAnd was it ever a good the! Most of our parties were<br />\nheld at The Dam, a secluded paradise dominated by a<br />\nhuge lawn looking out over a crystal-clear lake which<br />\ndisappeared down a spectacular waterfall . The lave was<br />\nused for skinny-dipping, after which hordes of us would<br />\nlie around in the sun loafing, throwing frisbees and<br />\nsmoking until we nad no brains to feel.<br />\nSo there I was - fourteen years old with my flair just<br />\nbeginning to creep down over the edge of my collar,<br />\nsurrounded by radiant, nubile females passing me bowl<br />\nafter bowl of black moroccan nash. Can you blame me<br />\nwiten I say it never occurred to me to do anything else?<br />\nDoes it surprise you wnen I say I wanted nothing more<br />\nout of life than to stay stoned 24 nours a day? I admit<br />\nthat boarding school occasionally got a little stifling - but<br />\nso what if I had to go to cnapel every morning, and eat at<br />\nan assigned table, and be in bed by 9:30 every night? I<br />\ndidn't care. Rules are made to be broken, and besides, I<br />\nknew everything would be all right once I made it to<br />\ncollege.<br />\nAh, college! From the moment I started reading about<br />\nit in Time magazine, I knew what it would be like: heavy<br />\npolitics, free love and LSD - not to mention unlimited<br />\nquantities of Columbian Gold. I could nardly wait. After.<br />\nall, wasn't this what education is all about? Being given a<br />\nlittle freedom and a safe place to test your wings? If our<br />\nparties at boarding school were extravagant, think of wilat<br />\nlife at college would be like!<br /><br />\n\u2022 A freshman from New York City, intent on<br />\nevaluating his first year at Hopkins, prefaced his remarks<br />\nwith an apologetic, \"although I do get stoned all the<br />\ntime....\" He accompanied this statement with an<br />\nexpressive, exasperated rollirk of nis bloodshot eyes. The<br />\nimplication was clearly that this was not iiis desired state,<br />\nyet like so many closet tokers left over from the fabulous<br />\nSixties, he continues to smoke - furtively, in secret, and<br />\noften alone.<br />\nTite salient feature of these illustrations is not that<br />\nthese people are \"addicted\" to marijuana. The crux of the<br />\nmatter is that, unlike most alcoholics, heavy marijuana<br />\nsmokers tend to be highly' aware of and extremely<br />\ndepressed about their habit - especially when they get<br />\nstoned.<br />\nDon't get me wrong. I'm not proud that I smoke dope,<br />\neither. In fact, I'm ashamed of it - just like everybody<br />\nelse. What I want to determine is exactly what causes this<br />\nshame - for it seems to me to be not so much related to<br />\nthe fact of being addicted to a drug as being a direct<br />\nbyproduct of the drug itself.<br /><br />\nwas first beginning to come into vogue, it really was a<br />\nsymbol of rebellion - and nothing more. Now that we<br />\n\"revolution\" is \"over,\" people are discovering that tile<br />\neffects of even moderate smoking are not really all that<br />\npleasant. Many of us are also learning that there is such a<br />\nthing as addiction to marijuana, even if it's only<br />\npsychological. And believe me, constant puffing can get<br />\nto be a real drag.<br />\nStill, old ways die hard, and many people wit\u00b0 wish to<br />\nreject conventional society still narbor the vague notion<br />\nthat smoking dope is somehow a prerequisite to joining<br />\nthe counterculture. Consequently, once these people<br />\nmake the all-important decision not to smoke, they feel<br />\nobliged to emphasize that their abstinence does not<br />\nconstitute a rejection of the drug.<br />\nThis increasingly prevalent attitude creates a new, and<br />\nfascinating, double standard. For example, a close friend<br />\nof mine and I were recently discussing tile possibility of<br />\ndriving out to a-farm in western Maryland this afternoon.<br />\nEarly in our conversation lie warned me, \"I'm afraid I<br />\nwon't want to smoke any dope.\" He paused, then added<br /><br />\n\u2014 \u2014Ar<br />\nLast fall I came to Johns Hopkins as a freshman, six<br />\nyears older and only a little wiser. Granted, I've settled<br />\ndown a bit since the nalcyon years of my youth - but I<br />\nfully expected to be able to cut loose and enjoy a good<br />\nparty once in a while. As a matter of fact, after a couple<br />\nof years of working and living alone I was really looking<br />\nforward to it. Imagine my surprise, then, wilen I<br />\ndiscovered that nobody on this campus smokes dope.<br />\nI don't mean that literally, of course - quite a few<br />\nHoppies like to catch a buzz over the weekend, or stay<br />\nstoned during Rush Week, or sneak a quick bong hit<br />\nbefore they go to bed at night. But it's different. It really<br />\nis. Somehow, smoking dope isn't thought of as being<br />\nmuch fun anymore.<br />\nTo begin with, the stoner community at Hopkins seems<br />\nto be virtually devoid of females, and those girls who do<br />\nindulge tend to do so in small groups, behind closed<br />\ndoors. For that matter, it never seems to occur to anyone<br />\nto move the party outside. Perhaps it's just the fact that<br />\nwe live in a city, but I'm willing to bet that most of the<br />\nbongs on this campus nave never seen the lignt of day.<br />\nMore importantly, however, the few students at<br />\nHopkins who continue to get high regularly seem totally<br />\ndifferent from the tokers of yesteryear. When I was a<br />\nyoungster, people were proud they smoked dope. They<br />\nused to brag about it, convince their friends to try it, talk<br />\nabout the goddamn stuff all the time. Nowadays, if a<br />\nperson consumes an inordinate amount of zeet, they like<br />\nto keep it a secret. Not because it's illegal - that's not a<br />\nconsideration anymore. But marijuana seems to nave gone<br />\nthe way of the cigarette: in a remarkably short period of<br />\ntime, blatant, carefree smoking has become tabOo.<br />\nFurthermore, those persons who do smoke heavily often<br />\nconsider themselves trapped by the drug, and make<br />\nfrequent (and unsuccessful) attempts to give it up.<br />\nPerhapsia couple of examples will better illustrate my<br />\npoint:<br />\n\u2022A fellow boarding school veteran on my floor - and a<br />\nfrequent smoking companion - made a resolution during<br />\nthe first week of the fall term to give up smoking after ne<br />\nhad finished his final summer ounce. That resolution has<br />\nbeen repeated innumerable times since - only to be<br />\nrescinded within 48 hours due to a sudden, irresistible<br />\ncraving which can only be alleviated by rushing out of the<br />\ndorm at midnight and scoring a nickel bag. Last weekend,<br />\nin a desperate attempt to study for nis exams, this student<br />\nentrusted our housemaster with nis bong because as ne<br />\nexplains it, \"I don't trust myself with it anymore.\"<br />\nPAGE8/MAY 5, 1978'<br /><br />\nillustration by Lisa Kay Pease<br /><br />\nAfter all, surely nobody can argue that marijuana is<br />\nmore dangerous than alcohol - yet drinking nas never been<br />\nmore popular. Why? Because despite its dangers, getting<br />\nplastered can be a hell of a lot of fun. It breaks down our<br />\ndeepest inhibitions, making us giddy, and wild, and<br />\ngenerally enables us to loosen up and have a good time.<br />\nDope's not like that. It tends to make the user<br />\nextremely introspective, reminding him of all ais troubles<br />\ninstead of nelping him to forget. What's worse, after<br />\nrepeated usage it starts to grow on him, like a cancer, so<br />\nthat before long lie's not really happy when he is stoned;<br />\nit's just that ne's miserable when he's not.<br />\nTaking all this into consideration, the obvious question<br />\nis: why did it seem like so much fun in the first place?<br />\nAre my happy memories of boarding school merely an<br />\nillusion? Or is ther,2, some fundamental difference between<br />\nthe way people smoked dope then and the way they do<br />\nnow?<br />\nI'm inclined to favor the latter alternative - and unless<br />\nI'm mistaken, it has something to do with marijuana<br />\nbecoming a part of the status quo. For back when dope<br /><br />\nin an encouraging tone,\"But you can go anead and smoke<br />\nas much as you like!\"<br />\nWhat's going on here? Why do we nave to apologize foi<br />\nbeing straight? After all, we already feel guilty when we<br />\ndo smoke marijuana - do we also have to feel guilty when<br />\nwe don't? The real kicker nere is that by continuing to<br />\nencourage others to smoke, we sustain the social pressure<br />\nwhich makes it so difficult for us to quit. It all seems so<br />\ncomplicated....<br />\nEnougn. If there's a message hidden behind all this, I<br />\ncertainly can't decipher it. I'm still in favor of<br />\nlegalization, and there's no question that I'll continue to<br />\nindulge. Still, as I sit huddled ill my damp little single,<br />\nfilled with self-loatning as I fIll up another bong, my<br />\nthoughts drift back to the fall of 1971, when girls smoked<br />\nfreely and parties were neld outdoors. Because dammit,<br />\ngetting stoned still meant something then.<br />\nBill Newlin is also addicted to nicotine, caffeine,<br />\ncodeine, and various other substances too numerous to be<br />\nmentioned here.<br /><br />\nIrtre, \u2022<br />\nig<br /><br />\nBeing of the campus we were naturally heir to a certain<br />\ngood-natured elitism, which manifested from time to time<br />\nin the unhurried cocking of an ear or the nonchalant<br />\nbrush of a paw. If anything, we felt pity, not scornifor the<br />\nscores of apartment dogs who were daily led through the<br />\nquadrangles at such a somnambular pace by thier doting<br />\nStubby legged and leashed, they seemed to<br />\nmasters.<br />\nfear us and our freedom more than envy it -- their grassy<br />\nbrowsing always being accomplished with a bit of<br />\nill-concealed uneasiness. Caligula, in one of his more<br />\ncharitable moments(so rare towards the end) told us that<br />\nWe suffered no leashes because our young masters had not<br />\nyet accepted theirs: not yet felt the fear of things free<br />\nand unordered that weighed down so heavily upon their<br />\nelders. But Caligula was full of parables vague and ominous,<br />\nand often seemed to pronounce them only to himself and<br />\nthe night air, despairing that the rest of us, dullards all,<br />\nwould ever understand. Many times we did not, but that<br />\nonly increased our devotion, for we sensed that he had<br />\ngone far beyond us on a road that was both dark and<br />\nexciting at the same time. Since he was the first to travel<br />\nthat road he did not --could not-- see where it would lead.<br />\nI saw its bloody terminus that awful spring day and<br />\nthought to turn away from it forever, only to be so<br />\nnerversely curious now, in the quite moments of the night.<br />\nOne pronouncement of his, however, we had no<br />\ntrouble understanding. \"Man,\" he said from the<br />\nbeginning, \"is the cruelest of creatures. And that is<br />\nPrecisely why he rules.\" No, their cruelty was never in<br />\nquestion. It is something you learn early on about men,<br />\nand yet it never really ceases to amaze you, no matter<br />\nnow many seasons you have seen. Not cruelty to US, you<br />\nunderstand-- oh n it is never been anything but pets and<br />\ncooings for us, nothing but laughter and gentle hugs. The<br />\ncruelty they save for themselves, hoarding it to their<br />\nSpecies like misers. Caligula said that that was why they<br />\nkept us \u2014 that they desperately, pitifully, needed some<br />\nkind of living creature to love, and could find none among<br />\nthemselves. We rind to be there, Je said, or they would'surely<br />\ngo mad fromloneliness. True, the rooms and hallways of men<br />\nare always the same, permiated with that faint smell of<br />\nsadness, so a part of everything Man that nothing can<br />\nwash it away. The scent of every man may be different,<br />\nbut it is always variations on a somber theme;<br />\npermutations of the same, stifling loneliness.<br />\nHow can I explain what it is like? How can I describe<br />\nthe desolate odor of those beings? Loneliness is a<br />\nalways sets<br />\nsensation so alien to our kind that it<br />\nour nostrils to burning and raises our fur, though it has<br />\nbecome familiar beyond remembering. It is awful, it is<br />\nfrightening, and it eminates solely from Man. Even on the<br />\nfrestiest spring days, when Nature was bougn-bent wito<br />\nlove and life, the stench of loneliness could rise from their<br />\nassembled bodies basking in the sun and move like a<br />\nnoxious cloud over the freshly mown grass. It never left<br />\nt hem completely, even when they were happiest.<br />\nHappiness-- how rarely they knew its touch! Occasionally<br />\nWe came across a pair of lovers gently caressing on the<br />\ngrass,. lost in playful anticipation of intimacies to come,<br />\nand only a trace of it would remain. Such couples were<br />\nusually annoyed at the way we clustered about them<br />\nduririg those interludes, quitely resenting our wet noses<br />\nand playful growling; but they did not understand what an<br />\nawsome relief it was for us - to approach the creatures<br />\nwho loved us and fed us without being constantly<br />\nreminded of their crippled souls. I mention it because it<br />\nWas the loneliness of Man that drove Caligula to his own,<br />\nsolitary end.<br />\nWhen I remeber Caligula now, the picture is almost<br />\nalways nocturnal. That was when he was at his most<br />\nInspiring; black, sainy coat adding to the mystery he<br />\nProjected so well. It was his eyes that really made<br />\n\"lowers of us, though. Gleaming in the lamplight, you<br />\nknew that something intensely important was going on<br />\nbehind them, sometiiing that could be approached but<br />\nnever grasped, like a red hot coal on a grate. We followed<br />\nthose eyes on countless midnight forays, not really<br />\nUnderstanding what we were doing, but feeling a great<br />\nIndistinct purpose behind it all. Lurking outside lighted<br />\nw indows, we silently watched tile men. Caligula was<br />\nalway s closest to the glass, sometimes with his paws on<br />\nthe sill, breath clouding the pane. The sadness in dis eyes<br />\nas he wateched them made me fear for him terribly, and it<br />\n\"vas at those times that the sense of danger ceased to be<br />\nJust a vague shadow and actually emerged form the night<br />\nto crouoh menacingly behind the nearest bush. We<br />\nwatched them toil over books, microscopes, models, and<br />\nendless disarrayed papers. We watched as they laughed and<br />\nw_evt. We saw Ltem mating on beds, tables, cnairs, stacks<br />\n\u00b0st books, or \u201eressed<br />\ntiy against the wail. We saw them<br />\n`aress and beat each other.

We are what we are and Man is what he is -- it is our<br />\nblessing and our curse. It is the way things are. Caliguia,<br />\nwoo had always been our leader, by definition the best<br />\nexploiter of things as they were, was now dissatisfied wit.<br />\nthe world -- and helpless to change it.<br />\nFrom then on his great change was apparent to<br />\neverybody. His enastizements became crueler and mvre<br />\nfrequent, hardly a day going by when one of us failed to feel<br />\nthe tig of his fangs for some minor offence.

Ttie men had ,Lealed all the<br />\ndry, brittle leaves into great mounds, and tile topmost<br />\nlayers were picking up and floating from pile to pile in a<br />\ngentle wind-borne exchange. It was a lazy day, but<br />\nCaligula ,had plans. When i first saw him, he was emerging<br />\nfrom one, of the buildings at a trot. Clettened in his<br />\npowerful jaws was a burning stick, ,iliered from some<br />\nfireplace inside, and it left a trail of grey swirling smoke as<br />\nhe ran. He was naliway to the fir.A pile of leaves wnen<br />\nwind changed abruptly, blowing the flame directly into<br />\nhis face. With a yei. of pain he momentarily dropped the<br />\nstick, only to \u201elea it up in the other side of his moutit and<br />\ncontinue on. , Again the gu.,ts came and again he was<br />\nburned, but, hardly seeming to care, he dragged, carried,<br />\nand rolled the flaming stick toward tne leaves with<br />\nmaniacal endurance. When the distance had finally been<br />\ntraversed, however, and the stick pushed under the<br />\nmound, it was all for 'taught because the flame had<br />\nalready died. He stood there looking at us, eyes burning<br />\nwith pain and humiliating, hairs singed and melted, even<br />\nthen silently voicing .115 proud contempt. He had tried at<br />\nleast, he seemed to say. He had tried...we tied not and<br />\nnever would.

The wonderous freedom I<br />\nrealization that after I leave for Baltimore in two hours,<br />\nhad expected had been transformed into a web of<br />\nnothing will ever be the same again.<br />\nrestrictions. I lacked definition. My essence stunk like a<br />\npair of sweaty gym shorts hanging in a locker.<br />\nI got drunk on my first excursion into darkest<br />\nI've finished crying now. My roommate wears a yamulke<br />\nBaltimore, though it was only a block party on 34th<br />\nand a heavy Yiddish accent. Neither was allowed in<br />\nStreet sponsored by the Grad Club. The ejuarters my auitt<br />\ncentral New Jersey. I've been here eight hours now and<br />\nhad willed me for laundry money paid for innumerable<br />\nstill don't know where the bathroom is. For dinner I<br />\nbeers served, mind you, to a sniveling seventeen -year-old<br />\nsuffered the cafeteria's dreaded veal cutlet; the<br />\nwho was glad they only winked at the warning red streak<br />\nhumiliation of eating alone amidst all the mirth<br />\non his ID card. The details of the evening have slipped my<br />\nand rivrriment destroyed any chance for happy digestion,<br />\nconsciousness. Oh, there was that girl we met who looked<br />\nso now my intestines writhe like molting snakes. I try to<br />\nlike a poodle---was her name Carrie? We went to Harley's,<br />\nnap, but the noise of the promised concupisence on the<br />\nof all places, for a pizza. (We were just freshmen and<br />\nquad keeps my eyes jumping. Already I am an outcast and<br />\ndidn't know any better) Carrie wasn't a student at<br />\nIdecide, with all my moral fortitude, to forget about<br />\nHopkins but lived at 2972 Calvert. Why are we sitting on<br />\nhaving a good time and dedicate my time in this cell to<br />\nthe curb waiting for a bus? Excuse me but I gotta take a<br />\nthe achievement of academic excellence.<br />\nwhiz, so I used the restroom hi that smokey bar across the<br />\nThe first turn of the screw. As John Knowles wrote in<br />\nstreet, the Blue Jay. Might as well walk you home, it's<br />\nA Separate Peace, everyone has a unique moment in<br />\nonly a few blocks. But it's night. The hallway is painted<br />\nhistory and the imprint of that instant you carry forever,<br />\nblack and we sit in the kitchen when the television<br />\nlike a set of dog tags. \"You won't believe this, but I've<br />\nblabbers; somebody passes a joint and Bert Parks crowns<br />\nnever done anything like this before.\"<br />\nMiss America and I'm going to scream.<br />\nA sardonic smile twists his lips. \"You really do live out<br />\nSometimes I think of my freshman year as a<br />\nin the sticks.\"<br />\nnine-month-long bout in a sickbed.

The room begins to smell like what I always<br />\nroomie left for classes, I stayed in bed and squeezed the<br /><br />\nblood pimples on my weakling's chest. How far will th<br />\nblood spurt? I never masturbated.<br />\nI laughed for five minutes when I heard that Andy<br />\nHartman, a wimp back home in Jersey, had enlisted, in<br />\nthe Air Force. I was high at the time, the cocktail hour<br />\nbetween my library work and dinner. Praise the Lord and<br />\npass the bong and every paragraph is getting shorter. And<br />\nshorter.<br />\nThe center is weakening. I wanted to get good grades; I<br />\nwanted to go to grad school and become a clinical<br />\npsychologist. I wanted to help people. But any hopes for<br />\ngrad school and a professional career were quashed in the<br />\nspring of my freshman year. To this day I have no inkling<br />\nof what happened to cause such a radical degeneration of<br />\nmy mental facilities. I remember working hard....Perhaps<br />\nJohns Hopkins demanded a more astute student than<br />\nmyself. A B performance on my finals converted the<br />\nmidterm Fs into terminal Cs. Did I dare tiptoe to the<br />\nbrink of a nervous collapse?<br />\nIn those late February days, my body trembled with<br />\nnervous laughter. Should I join a frat? Negative. Let's get<br />\nthe high before we go out partying. That's the only way I<br />\ncan face the. I only remember the scattered fragments;<br />\nthe process is like picking up pieces of a broken glass. At<br />\nlunch I choke on eggplant parmesan and scare poor Bob<br />\nhalf to death. I laugh hysterically at Don Knotts,\"Brush<br />\nyour dentist twice a day and visit your teeth once a year.\"<br />\nLosing control of my faci.<br />\nSomehow I muster the strength to buck up. The viral<br />\ninfection in my brain has passed, and I recover intime to<br />\nsave my academic skin. I can not express the desperation I<br />\nfelt during that time, the empty confusion behavioral<br />\npsychologists call learned helplessness.<br />\nI must regain my perspective.- Years from now I<br />\nsuppose laughter will come easily upon memories of my<br />\nnaivete and inexperience. The road to tragedy is paved<br />\nwith comedy, but now at the end of my fourth and final<br />\nyear at Hopkins, I feel nothing but sadness. I should have<br />\ngone to the White House for help, but I was too cocksure<br />\nand smart-assed to admit the problem. Passivity is an<br />\naddictive failure, and those were the days of wine and<br />\nneurosis. Perhaps I'm blowing this miniscule malaise out<br />\nof proportion\u2014there's nothing more boring than the<br />\nteary-eyed tale of a troubled adolescent. Yet, my entire<br />\nfuture was altered by this mental breakdown. A 1.76<br />\naverage can never be saved; graduate work and a<br />\nprofessional career just weren't in the cards the fates had<br />\ndealt.<br />\nI can't write about pain anymore. The happiest<br />\nmoment in my freshman year was when I handed in the<br />\nkey to my room and then, seeing my father waving from<br />\nthe packed car, I walk out, like maddop, Englishmen, and<br />\nHopkins students, into the midday sun.<br /><br />\nThe Blessed<br />\nRage<br />\nOh! Blessed rage for order, pale Rarnon the maker's rage<br />\nto order words of the sea, words of the fragrant portal,<br />\ndirty-stained, and of ourselves and of our origins, in<br />\nghostlier demarcations, keener sounds, Wallace Stevens,<br />\n\"The Idea of Order at Key West.\"<br />\nUsually I don't drink in the afternoon but today<br />\nmake an exception. I've just learned that th brillo-haired<br />\nEnglish TA will flunk me because I didn't bother to<br />\nattend his horrific conference sections. Of course I<br />\nhanded in some of the papers late, but I did all of them<br />\nand hell, I'm only taking the course pass-fail. But that<br />\ncesspool-breathed grad student has taken it upon himself<br />\nto create his own precious little flunkie in his first (and<br />\nhopefully,last) teaching position. Whatever happened to<br />\nthe solidarity of students? Comrade, you're only a few<br />\nyears older so why can't we unite to fight the capitalistic<br />\noppression so rampant in American academics?<br />\nI hate studying and grades. Yet here I am proposing to<br />\ntell the story of my academic career. What a longtwo<br />\nyears it has been since I resolved to exterminate that<br />\ntermite grad student if I should come up three credits<br />\nshort of graduation. Johns Hopkins just isn't the place for<br />\nthe pre-nothing I became after my freshman year. I<br />\nhonestly believe the system itself is not all that bad; the<br />\nfault, dear students, lies not in the stars but in ourselves.<br />\nLet's face it\u2014Hopkins would be great if it wasn't for<br />\nthose greedy, throaty, nerdy pre-people that fill the<br />\nstudent Directory.<br /><br />\nIf I sound bitter that's because I am. The<br />\npre-professional competition at Hopkins ruins the college<br />\nexperience for quixotic derelicts like myself who see<br />\nsimple valor in the simple absorption of ideas, and honor<br />\nwhatsoever in rubbing noses against the shriveled buttocks<br />\nof aged professors. Grades are nefarious symbols, the<br />\nmere indicators of how well the eager pupil has mastered<br />\nthe tricks of the academic trade. I wish I could name<br />\nnames here to prove my unbiased contention that<br />\nintelligence is no correlate to good grades, but the<br />\nstringent laws oflibel prevent me from publicly debunking<br />\nsuch supnosedlv respectable people.<br />\nSome of my courses have been soiled by this horde of<br />\ngreedy academical locusts. In an upper-levelpsychology<br />\ncourse reputed to be gutsville, I felt so ashamed at my<br />\nfellow students' nagging that I almost went up to the<br />\nprofessor and apologized for their infantile whims. They<br />\nberated the poor professor needlesslywith the pickiest of<br />\nexam details, and anyone with the least bit of cool knew<br />\nthe A was well in the bag. Occasionally, when my nearly<br />\nimpeccable defenses are at their weakest, my bitterness<br />\nbubbles over into amercilessly delivered tirade against my<br />\nbest friends (innocent though they may be). I call these<br />\nfine people misers, leeches, lechers, vermin and varmints.<br />\nAfterwards I cower in profuse apologies for my<br />\nmisanthropicabuse. I should be more tolerant of those<br />\nunfortunate enough to believe the ersatz side of<br />\neducation. Of course pity mixes with anger and disgust<br />\nwhen I regard the few who still cling to a child's ocncept<br />\nof education, that knowledge is a quantitative function, a<br />\ntangible. Even sadder are those who carry this demented<br />\nphilosophy over to the humanities; for them there really<br />\nis no hope. As a leaving senior, I can only say that I look<br />\nat you all. sympathetically, while my transcript gently<br />\nweeps. Naturally the question arises as to the purpose of<br />\na college education. At Homewood the answer is very<br />\nsimple; Hopkins is nothing more than a glorified liberal<br />\nprep school, readying its students for the big casino of<br />\nGrad school. I suppose there once were some halycon<br />\ndays when a mere B.A. from Hopkins waas worth<br />\nsomething in the world. \"There goes a Hopkins man,\"<br />\nthey whisper in hushed reverence. Now a B.A.in Social<br />\nand Behavioral Science will get you ,along with fifty cents,<br />\na ride on the New York subway.<br />\nSometimes I find it hard to understand that peculiar<br />\npersonality quirk that allows one to tolerate tie four<br />\nmore years in a classroom after high school. Quite<br />\nobviously these gluttons have never matured and now<br />\nthey're afraid of what might lurk outside the academic<br />\ncocoon. The teacher is a surrogate parent; you realized<br />\nthat in your first crawl into kindergarden and the same<br />\nPsychological relationship was maintained, either<br />\nconsciously or unconsciously, for the next twenty years.<br />\nAt darkest moments,'when the grim face of failure smiles<br />\nalluringly, I suddenly have more admiration for those<br />\nroughnecks back home in Jersey who just barely<br />\ngraduated from high school and now have jobs, menial by<br />\nour sophisticated Hopkins standards, Inumping gas ,<br />\nsurveying farmlands, etc. More importantly, however,<br />\nadmire their courage to be independent, to take that<br />\nProverbial giant step into what we cushioned academic<br />\nPansies call cruel reality.<br />\nIt is at moments like this (6:47 p.m. Tuesday, May 15,<br />\n1976) in the Rat licking the foam off the inside of a beer<br />\nmug that I regret not possessing the gumption or talent to<br />\nbecome an authentic renegade. The merry vagabond I<br />\nChopping wood in an Oregon commune and then coming<br />\nhome with the kindling for mu kindred, little Garth a<br />\nsuckling at my lactescent soulmate, the spiritual outrigger<br />\nwho shares my straw mattress.Of course I am hardly<br />\nstrong enough to lift an axe, let alone fell the mighty trees<br />\nmy father probably planted back in '37 as a member of<br />\nthe CCC, a touch of irony only approaching that of the<br />\nrole Steven Muller played in the handling of the militant<br />\ntakeover of Willard Straight Hall in Cornell in 1968 wile<br />\nmy brother played and drank gin in his dorm room and<br />\neventually flunked out, and now Steven Muller refuses to<br />\neven say hello at a reception. I shouldn't write when the<br />\nbubbly gets the better of me; the ideas are spiced with<br />\nbrilliance (just as mashed potatoes are spiked with<br />\nSaltpeter at exclusive prep schools) but lack organization<br />\nand flex unrealistically with the illogic of emotions. I<br />\nmust return to more serious matters.<br />\nMY my senior year was the Pfeffer case, which<br />\nquestioned the value of a profejmr's teaching ability. The<br />\nstudents raised their puny voicei muted protest, but<br />\nalas to no avail. Suddenly students became aware of the<br />\nfact that research, not teaching, is emphasized among the<br />\nranks at Hopkins. These complaints have, at most, hollow<br />\nValidity The quality of teaching at this University will<br />\nnever improve unless the students tnemselves take a more<br />\nactive interest in learning and not in getting good grades<br />\nUnless professors are convinced that their pupils are truly<br />\ninterested in learning, there is absolutely no reason for<br /><br />\ndotoN Japuual\"<br /><br />\nMore Tristes<br /><br />\nthem to care about callous youth who exploit tile faculty<br />\nfor their own advancement. The nearsightedness of youth<br />\ndoes not see the fact that the famed Hopkins coolness is<br />\nperfect training for the type of rigorous academics the<br />\nmajority will face in grad school. Hopkins' dedication to<br />\nresearch is publicized to the point of boredom so that we<br />\nshould have known before we came what was in store.<br />\nI can not believe my bitterness. Selfishly I repine in my<br />\nown peculiar vitriolic way against the whole of the<br />\nHopkins student body, the majority of whom I haven't<br />\neven met. I think I know the source of my anger. Fiinally,<br />\nnow in the fast-fading twilight of my days here, I realize<br />\nthat 1 am only to blame for iii,' relative failure at<br />\nHopkins. It's easier, psychologically and physically, to<br />\nblame the external factors rather than admit the truth and<br />\none's own failures. As the old guidance counselor cliche<br />\ngoes, I just didn't apply myself after that disastrous<br />\nfreshman year. Sure, I maintained a B average, but my<br />\nheart and mind were far removed from the effort. I will<br />\nhave gotten no tangible rewards from my college career<br />\nsave for the piece of sheepskin Dr. Muller hands to me.<br />\nHas the ilard-earned and lent money been wasted by this<br />\nbag of lazybones? I don't know; only the future will tell.<br />\nMy eyelids are beginning to sag under the weight of all<br />\nthe beer. It is time to go home now, nerhaps liave some<br />\nsupper, and then sleep off the drunk. I walk slowly across<br />\nthe campus as the sun sets behind Hampden and the<br />\nlengthening shadows stretch across the glory that is<br />\nHopkins.<br /><br />\nIn the Crease<br />\nAt the end of it all Frank Merriwell tells the villainous<br />\nHopkins man, \"I don't know how you happened to be<br />\nchosen the captain of the Hopkins team. You can play<br />\nlacrosse, but you are a dirty fellow.\"<br />\nBob Scott<br />\nLacrosse<br /><br />\nBut I still wish there were something less painful and<br />\nquicker than looking for love at a Notre Dame mixer.<br />\nAnonymous<br />\nA little after-dinner coitus does much to ease digestion,<br />\nbut unfortunately I've never had the chance to test this<br />\norgiastic antacid. I'm a real die-hardsadsack. At the end<br />\nof my sophomore year, I sat down and set th<br />\ne<br />\nobjectives I wished to accomplish during the remainder of<br />\nmy Hopkins years. In reverseorder of importance: a) to be<br />\neditor of the News-Letter, b) to be captain of the golf<br />\nteam, and c) to get laid. Now that it's time to divvy up<br />\nthe score, I realize that two out of three ain't bad.<br />\nI know that I'm not the most sociable gent to stalk the<br />\ndance floor. To be perfectly truthful, I'm a rather dull<br />\nblade who doesn't cut a sharp figure in public. The<br />\nhighlight of the social season back home was when the<br />\nwhole family packed into the Hupmobile for the fifty<br />\nmile drive to the annual Perkasie Firemen's Day Parade,<br />\nguzzled beer all afternoon, and then belched all the way<br />\nhome. As the attentive reader will readily recall, I arrived<br />\nat palatial Homewood with visions of becoming a dashing<br />\nrogue, in language more attuned to the customs and<br />\nmanners of the natives, a stud. Hopkins seemed such a<br />\nsocially obtuse oblivion that I reckoned I could pull off<br />\nthe ruse. The scheme was a blunder; I miscalculated my<br />\nfellow inmates' intentions.They too possessed the<br />\ndispositions of dolts and likewise formulated an identical<br />\ntrategy of masquerade. Appearances being merely<br />\n:dative, circumstances soon relegated me to the smelly pit<br />\nof solitude to which as a writer I have grown accustomed.<br />\nI've always defended the sparse social life at Hopkins as<br />\npreparation for the relentless boredom of maturity,<br />\ngranted that such an argument is nothing more than an<br />\nacute rationalization for a dingus like myself. Hopkins<br />\ndoes not coddle its students, which is too bad because<br />\nso 'many of them seem to need that exact kind<br />\noftreatment. I never realized until I came to Hopkins how<br />\nmany funny-looking people there were in the world.11ow<br />\nclearly one can see the pain of a ravaged adolescence<br />\n, etched upon their faces.

Red six on black<br />\nSeven.<br />\nA smooth spring breeze oozed through the screen. In<br />\nthe distance there was laughter and Westerly turned up<br />\nthe radio to cover the noise. He scruffed; the song was<br />\n\"Nowhere Man,\" and that's precisely what Westerly<br />\nthought of nimself that early May night. Here he was, a<br />\nyoung man about to graduate from the esteemed Johns<br />\nHopkins University with 3.23 average and what does he<br />\nhave to show for ins efforts? Westerly has no job, the<br />\ndemand for Social Relations majors being what it is; he<br />\ncould have gone to grad school if he had wanted to.<br />\nWesterly felt selfishly unloved and unwanted. He felt very<br />\ninsignificant, a speck of dust in the cosmic wind, to fall<br />\nback on a song on tile radio now. There's no place for the<br />\nred nine.<br />\nWesterly once had a lover. She was in one of his<br />\nseminars and they got to talking one day in the reserrve<br />\nroom. They ended u going to the movies that weekend<br />\nand he kissed her goodnight was before her door. He<br />\ndidn't particularly feel like kissing her, but of course he<br />\ndidn't ven know how he should feel.<br />\nWesterly had few girlfriends before this: He could never<br />\nexpress his love of solitude, yet he knew he was lonely<br />\nand needed someone. He wanted to take a girl's hand in<br />\nhis, or, even better, slip his arm around her wz.dst and<br />\nstroll across campus together to publicly declare their<br />\nyouth and affection. Yet, with Sally or any other girl, he<br />\ncould never bring himself to do any of this. Four years of<br />\nsocial science had distanced him from iiimself in a way lie<br />\ndidn't understand. He felt alien to himself. Things refused<br />\nto be simple for Westerly. He thought he was either gifted<br />\nor cursed, or a combination of the two.<br />\nBefore Sally nobody seemed to care for him in any but<br />\na superficilial way. They merely liked him as a nice guy<br />\nwhich was fine because he was incapable of feeling a deep<br />\npassion. Or so he thought. Sally lost his virginity. The<br />\nepisode seemed too commonplace to be special yet this is<br />\ntheway Westerly remembers it, as he does almost every<br />\nnight, in that space of time before turning out hte lights<br />\nand falling asleep. After a movie, they went to the Rat<br />\nand shared two pitchers of beer. They laughed and talked<br />\nand finally straggled back to her apartment when the<br />\nbartender came and shooed them away at closing time.<br />\nFor a time they talked on her couch, holding hands, then<br />\nshe disappeared and reappeared in her nightgown. Even<br />\nWesterly knew what this meant, and he followed her into<br />\nher room, and stripped, and after that first anxious<br />\nlovemaking, they clung together like two sheep in a storm<br />\nand stayed that way until the light of dawn came to save<br />\ntheir souls.<br /><br />\nTristesopkins<br />\nH<br /><br />\nMean motherfuckers yes we are and we mean business.<br />\nWhen a blue jay eats a Monarch butterfly, he goes<br />\nYeah manman, somebody get John.

Perhaps I<br />\nam an idealist, but I believe, that if the staff of the<br />\nNewletter would allow a viable channel for student<br />\nopinion and ideas, not only could the Hopkins<br />\ncommunity expand its narrow perspective, but that<br />\nstudents would rise to the occation and even write for the<br />\nNewletter!<br />\nIn concluding this letter, there are a few questions that<br />\nmust be asked. For whom is the Johns Hopkins<br />\nNewsletter written? By whom is it written? Who's opinion<br />\ndoes the Newsletter represent? Are the ideas and opinions<br />\nof students w/in this University worthwhile publishing<br />\nmaterial? Should the Newletter only concern itself with<br />\nthe ideas, and opinions which pertain to the 'narrow<br />\nscope of this university? Or, should it welcome ideas,<br />\nopinion, and that relates to other aspects of tnis world? If<br />\nwe do not concern ourselves with the outside world, what<br />\nkind of educational experience are we really allowing<br />\nourselves?<br />\nJenny Fox<br />\nTo the Editor: The Board of Intramural Athletics<br />\ntakes great exception to the accusations perpetrated in<br />\nlast Friday's Editorial and Letter to the Editor. The<br />\nclaims of discrimination against females are just as<br />\nPreposterous now as they were four years ago, when<br />\nwomen first applied and were accepted onto the BIA,<br />\nwhich was before varsity women's sports ever existed. It is<br />\nunfortunate that the editorial staff chose to indulge again<br />\nin the practice of irresponsible journalism by blindly<br />\nparroting the cornplaints of one<br />\nmis-informed<br />\nindividual about the program that involves more students<br />\nthan any other on campus. Now is a good time to set toe<br />\nrecord straight point by point.<br />\nIn response to the over-generalization that there \"are<br />\ncurrently no BIA sports for women,\" it sliould be noted<br />\nthat EVERY intramural event, with the possible<br />\nexception of wrestling, is open to coed participation. This<br />\nis explicitly stated in the BIA Bylaws as well as the rules<br />\nfor each sport (copies available upon . request). In<br />\naddition, all publicity announcements include the<br />\nstatement-open to all undergraduates.<br />\nBut have women been asked directly? The answer is<br />\nyes. In fact, coed volleyball failed during last term<br />\nbecause most teams could not fulfill the mandatory<br />\ntwo-girl per team requirement. As far as tile freshmen are<br />\nconcerned, the housemasters and the athletic reps of all<br />\ndorms, including Adams and Baker, nave gotten every<br />\nannouncement and scandal sheet in their mailboxes and<br />\nStill not a peep out of them.<br />\nCould it be that the girls need separate events because<br />\nthey cannot compete fairly against guys? This seems<br /><br />\nextremely unlikely in cases such as the. bike race, tennis,<br />\nbilliards, swimming, badminton, golf and softball. In fact,<br />\nit is only in football, baseball and lacrosse that women<br />\nhave a physical or ability disadvantage. For this reason, it<br />\nwas quite disappointing that when a special survey was<br />\nmade last fall to determine interest in :gymnastics, a sport<br />\nin which women usually excel, only two responses were<br />\nreceived. Only last year there was a soccer team entered<br />\nthat was composed entirely of women.<br />\nThe BIA exists to provide opportunities for interested<br />\nstudents to participate. It cannot go out recruiting people<br />\nall the time to form teams. By way of example, graduate<br />\nstudents are generally excluded from BIA events because<br />\nof age and skill differences. This year, many grad students<br />\nasked to play in BIA basketball. Since enough graduates<br />\nshowed interest by forming their own teams, there was set<br />\nup a Graduate League, complete with playoffs. On the<br />\nother hand, not a single Hopkins woman, even though<br />\nfully eligible from the start, ever expressed interest in<br />\nplaying intramural ball.<br />\nActually, it would be quite surprising to find many girls<br />\nplaying intramurals when the varsity women's program is<br />\nstruggling to improve. As claimed in the letter last Friday,<br />\n\"given the large number of women who try out for varsity<br />\nsports.\"the field hockey and basketball teams did not<br />\nhave enough members at their practices to hold full<br />\nscrimmages. Other sports, fielding smaller teams, must<br />\nrely on freshmen many of whom do not return to play for<br />\na second year, and a small core of women who play two<br />\nor more sports. .<br />\nThis doesn't alter the fact that not only are there<br />\npresently many BIA sports for women, but there have<br />\nbeen numerrous attempts in the past to arouse interest,<br />\nand there will be even more planned for the future. Next<br />\nyear's officers are already looking forward to promoting<br />\nwomen's entries, setting up girl's leagues, and improving<br />\nworking relations with the Coordinator of Women's<br />\nAthletics.<br />\nIt remains totally unexplained, however, why this has<br />\nnot been done in the past. Especially since the BIA has<br />\nhad two female members each of the past two years, and<br />\none for two years before that. Amazingly enough, every<br />\ngirl that has applied has professed to have contacts with<br />\nmany interested women, and the desire to foster women's<br />\nparticipation. Yet over the last four years, these women<br />\nhave accomplished relatively little to further their cause.<br />\nThey have been organizing the events, but they need<br />\nothers to participate.<br />\nNext year, the president should no longer suffer this<br />\nsupposed \"lack of support from his fellow board<br />\nmembers.\" Out of 13 applicants to next year's BIA, four<br />\nwere women; that is 30%. There were three women (30%)<br />\namong the 10 new-members selected.

These figures compare favorably to the<br />\nundergraduate female population, but far surpasses tne<br />\nproportion of females in intercollegiate athletics. With<br />\nresults such as these, the selection proceedings are<br />\ncertainly not biased, or politically motivated.<br />\nIn fact, fraternity members will be in the minority on<br />\nnext year's Board, further weakening the influence they<br />\nwield over intramural policy. In the past, the BIA has<br />\nbeen very attentive to the needs of dorms and frats<br />\nbecause intramural sports were sometimes the only<br />\nactivities keeping them together. During Lie past two<br />\nyears, however, there has been a noticeable emphasis on<br />\nparticipation by independents. The results have been so<br />\npromising that an Indep league was established this year<br />\nand trophy points awarded, while next year will probably<br />\nsee the institution of a year-long indep trophy.<br />\nIndependent entries have risen dramatically tills year,<br />\nover last year's unprecedented turnout football teams<br />\nwent from 6 to 7, baseball entries increased from 20 to<br />\n25, softball jumped from 1 to 16, and lacrosse from 8 to<br />\n10. Most smaller sports were equally well attended,<br />\nespecially tennis.<br />\nTo achieve turnouts such as tilese, there must have<br />\nbeen some sort of publicity. Articles have appeared in this<br />\npublication regularly and announcements are mailed and<br />\nposted campus-wide. Admittedly there is room for<br />\nimprovement in any organization's publicity on this<br />\ncampus. The BIA is again requesting funding for a 24-hour<br />\nrecorded message phone line to provide B1A's news<br />\nwhenever needed, which was turned down last fall.<br />\nNevertheless, publicity must be somewhat effective if 400<br />\npeople turn out for six weeks of basketball alone, when<br />\nthe Student Council can just barely find 25% of the<br />\nstudent body to take five minutes to vote. Besides, if so<br />\nmany people disapprove of the way the BIA is run, mere<br />\nshould have been many more applicants. As it were, more<br />\npeople applied for membership on the BIA than ran for<br />\nSC Office!?<br />\nIn conclusion, it should be apparent taat tile BIA is<br />\nextremely biased in its dedication to providing a widely<br />\nvaried program of intramural sports to as many students<br />\nas possible. Granted there are sometimes restrictions and<br />\nmistakes and maybe even less than perfectioQ. At least tile<br />\nBoard's aware of this and strives to minimize it. Public<br />\nsmear editorials and sensationalization of myopic<br />\nopinions in the News-Letter will achieve little, for<br />\nunbeknowns to the editors, the students at Hopkins know<br />\nwhat the Board of Intramural Athletics has gotten done.<br />\nSincerely,<br />\nAudrey Zettick<br />\nPhillip Gilly<br /><br />\nM.D./D.V.M.
