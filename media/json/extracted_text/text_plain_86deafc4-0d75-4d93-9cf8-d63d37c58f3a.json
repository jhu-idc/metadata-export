The<br />\nprofessor added, however, that<br />\nthe mixed student sentiment is<br />\nnothing new, and that reaction is<br />\ntypically varied to introductory<br />\neconomics courses.<br />\nIn light of these statements of<br />\ndisenchantment, many professors<br />\nhave elected to change<br />\ntheintroductory course. At<br />\nHopkins, Professor Hamilton says<br />\nthat he makes a concerted effort<br />\nto emphasize what economics has<br />\nto say about the problems of<br />\nunemployment, inflation,<br />\ntransportation, health care,<br />\npollution, and other student<br />\ninterest areas. \"While students<br />\ndon't learn anything about the<br />\nstock market in my course, we<br />\ncan offer a fairly crude<br />\nunderstanding of what can and<br />\ncannot be done regarding specific<br />\nproblem areas,\" Hamilton<br />\n<br />\nasserted.<br />\nNiehans contends that his<br />\nintroductory course is not<br />\ndesigned to offer practical, direct<br />\nhelp to students' individual<br />\nproblems. \"Students should take<br />\nbusiness courses to satisfy those<br />\nneeds,\" he remarked. The<br />\nprofessor said that the purpose of<br />\nhis introductory course is instead<br />\nto \"make students understand<br />\nwhat's going on today in the<br />\ndevelopment of the American<br />\neconomy.\" \"I hope to allow<br />\nstudents to better judge<br />\neconomic policy and to be able<br />\nto distinguish between correct<br />\nand fallacious arguments.\"<br />\nMany instructors feel that the<br />\nproblems of the introductory<br />\ncourse begin with the textbooks<br />\nused. Niehans spoke of certain<br />\nshortcomings in the most widely<br />\nknown economics text, Paul A.<br />\nSamuelson's \"Economics\". While<br />\nregarding this text, the one used<br />\nfor both of Hopkins introductory<br />\ncourses, as the most intellectually<br />\nenlightening and scientific,<br />\nNiehans admitted that the book<br />\nwas \"developed many years ago<br />\nwithout benefit of the present<br />\nlevel of economics' experience.\"<br />\n<br />\n1-le said this has led to various<br />\ninconsistencies between the book<br />\nand what is said in his<br />\nintroductory course lectures. \"I<br />\ndon't teach things which I feel<br />\nare obsolete,\" he concluded.<br />\nFor example, the long-run<br />\ndirect relationship posited in the<br />\nNobel Prize-winning Samuelson's<br />\ntext between inflation and<br />\nunemployment has been<br />\ndisproven in recent years.<br />\nNiehans, who shares the view<br />\nwith most other economists<br />\ntoday that unemployment<br />\ncannot be reduced in the<br />\nlong-run by exacting high<br />\ninflation, refuses to teach this<br />\nconcept to students.<br />\nWith so many students at<br />\nHopkins huddled before the altar<br />\nof the profession, there would<br />\nseem to be an unparalled<br />\nopportunity to attract new<br />\nblood. But the profession<br />\napparently takes another view of<br />\nwhat stands to be gained by the<br />\ndevelopment. \"I would hope, not<br />\nso much for an increased number<br />\nof economists, but rather, I hope<br />\nthat through this we can as a<br />\nprofession be more widely<br />\nappreciated,\" Hamilton said.<br />\n<br />\nsystem is \"not so much abuses in<br />\ndistributing funds, but the<br />\namount of money each district<br />\nreceives.\"<br />\nThe senator pointed out that<br />\nalthough different state<br />\nsub-divisions have different<br />\nfinancial needs, each district gets<br />\nthe same amount of money<br />\n($14,500). He was quick to add<br />\nthat \"most senators give them<br />\nout as fairly as possible.\"<br />\nSenator LaPides has previously<br />\nvoted to institute a program<br />\nwhere awards were granted solely<br />\non need so that \"scholarships<br />\nwould not be in the area of<br />\npolitics.\"<br />\nSeveral measures now before<br />\nthe Senate and the House of<br />\nDelegates would transfer the<br />\nauthority for awarding funds<br />\nfrom the legislators to an<br />\nimpartial body.

Friends continuously<br />\npester me with bizarre stories<br />\nabout their laundry and queries<br />\nabout when and where I wash tny<br />\nclothes. The issue, though, is<br />\nbasically a simple one. And<br />\ntherefore, I will try to supply<br />\nsome simple answers.<br />\nThe first step in doing laundry<br />\nis to acquire some dirty clothes.<br />\nWhile this is not a problem for<br />\nmost people, there are some very<br />\ntidy personages who may find<br />\nthis a difficult task. My basic<br />\nadvice to the dirt-deficient types<br />\nIs \"sweat a little.\" Get into those<br />\ntight spots that require a little<br />\nsquirming and wriggling. Don't<br />\navoid trouble\u2014look for it. Walk<br />\ndown Greenmount Avenue after<br />\ndark. Take biochemistry. Call<br />\nSteven Muller a fascist at a<br />\nTrustee meeting.<br />\nOnce you have those grimy<br />\nPieces of cloth, the next step is<br />\nto change them, preferably every<br />\nday. Now by 'changing' I do not<br />\nmean, as the old joke goes, that<br />\nYou are supposed to<br />\nchange with your roommate or<br />\nlab partner, but that you are to<br />\nfind new clothes every day\u2014a<br />\nthough task, I admit, one that<br />\nmany people find difficult to<br />\nremember, but necessary<br />\nnonetheless.<br />\nOf course, this constant influx<br />\nof dirty, smelly vestments will<br />\nPresent a buildup of various<br />\nun-niceties in your room, among<br />\nthem: a stench rivalled only by<br />\nthe one emanating from the<br />\nGovernor's Mansion in<br />\nAnnapolis, several insects drawn<br />\nto the warmth the moisture of<br />\n<br />\nyour clothes heap, and possibly<br />\neven a note from your roommate<br />\nexplaining his decision to move<br />\nto another part of town. But<br />\ndon't let these pitfalls discourage<br />\nyou; there are -hays to cope. You<br />\ncould, of course, burn your<br />\nclothes immediately after soiling<br />\nthem, avoiding the need to do<br />\nyour laundry at all, but<br />\nmanufacturers agree that this sort<br />\nof treatment diminishes the<br />\nwear-life of yOur garments. A<br />\nbetter choice would be to keep<br />\nyour dirties in their own<br />\ncontainer, preferably a sanitized<br />\none, to keep them off the floct<br />\nand out of the air. There are<br />\nmany styles of laundry holders<br />\nand each student should pick the<br />\none that best suits his needs.<br />\nThere is always the handy-dandy<br />\nJHU laundry bag, made of the<br />\nfinest quality imported silk or<br />\ncheapest cotton (whichever is<br />\navailable at the bookstore). The<br />\nJHU bag is a fine example of<br />\ngood ole American know-how:<br />\nthe cost of the bag is enough to<br />\npay for a year's washings. More<br />\n<br />\nfrugal students may elect to use<br />\nmore common, less expensive<br />\nitems, such as: paper bags, boxes,<br />\npillow cases, a balloon (dubious),<br />\nor even, appropriately, a Hefty<br />\nplastic garbage bag. Looks are of<br />\nno import here, so don't be<br />\nafraid to be original. And<br />\nremember, when it comes to<br />\nlaundry holders, the bigger the<br />\nbetter, because then you have<br />\nmore time between washings;less<br />\ntime to face that awful battle<br />\nbetween man and machine\u2014the<br />\nconfrontation of trouble and<br />\nbubbles.<br />\nNow that you're well-versed in<br />\nthe prerequisites for<br />\nlaundry-doing, it's time to get<br />\ndown to the grass roots issue<br />\nitself\u2014the actual doing of the<br />\nwash. The idea of laundromat<br />\netiquette has been around for<br />\nquite some time, but people who<br />\nadhere to Amy Vanderbilt's lofty<br />\nstandards often take days trying<br />\nto do a single load. The strategy<br />\nis to be aggressive, push and<br />\nshove your way through to get<br />\nthe painful drudgery over with as<br />\nquickly as possibly. If someone's .E<br />\nthings are sitting idly after a<br />\nwash, toss them out of the<br />\nmachine and get ; yours going, Of<br />\ncourse, you'd better have<br />\nremembered to bring the exact<br />\nnumber of quarters, dimes, and<br />\nkopeks to start the machines, or<br />\nelse your wash will just sit there<br />\nlike beers at a temperance<br />\nmeeting. If you have forgotten<br />\nyour money and must leave the<br />\n'mat' to get more, you run the<br />\nrisk of having your precious<br />\npossessions being strewn about<br />\nthe room, which some people<br />\nmight call justice.

American had come<br />\noff a strong victory over<br />\nWashington and Lee the night<br />\nbefore and was psyched for the<br />\nJays. This forced Coach Frank<br />\nComfort to make some<br />\nlast-minute adjustments in<br />\ncertain events to match Blue Jay<br />\nstrengths with the Eagles'.<br />\nThe meet got off to an<br />\nexcellent start for the Jays as the<br />\n400-yard medley relay team of<br />\n<br />\nMike Bay, Dean Buchenauer,<br />\nFrank McGovern, and Jim<br />\nSpiering finished with a time of<br />\n3:45.0. This broke the American<br />\npool record of 3:46.6 set two<br />\nyears ago.<br />\nFor the rest of the individual<br />\nevents, each team was limited to<br />\nonly two swimmers due to the<br />\nsmall size of the pool (i.e., 4<br />\nlanes). Freshman Brad Procton<br />\ntook second place in the<br />\n1000-yard freestyle followed by<br />\nTy Lanahan in third.<br />\nThe 200-yard freestyle<br />\nfollowed as freshman Frank<br />\nJones finished second, just ahead<br />\n<br />\nof Bob Stoever. The 50-yard<br />\nfreestyle was one of the closest<br />\nevents of the afternoon as<br />\nfreshman Roy Beveridge was<br />\nnosed out by .09 seconds by an<br />\nAmerican swimmer.<br />\nThe following event put the<br />\nspotlight on freshman Mike Bay<br />\nwho went on to set two pool<br />\nindividual records, besides his<br />\npart in the record setting time<br />\nturned in by the medley relay<br />\nteam. In the 200-yard individual<br />\nmedley, Bay's time of 2:02.6<br />\nbettered the old mark of 2:04.<br />\nHe then destroyed the old mark<br />\nof 2:02.7 in the 200-yard<br />\n<br />\nbackstroke as he ran away from<br />\nthe rest of the field and finished<br />\nwith a time of 1:59.3!<br />\nThe diving events saw the top<br />\ntwo spots split between<br />\nHomewooders; freshman Mike<br />\nDiCio and sophomore Jay<br />\nDarrell. Darrell edged out DiCio<br />\nin the one-meter competition<br />\n140.8-139.2 as the next<br />\nAmerican diver posted a score of<br />\n73.4. The three-meter event was<br />\ntaken by DiCio with a score of<br />\n228.6 as Darrell finished second<br />\nwith no American divers entered<br />\nin the competition.<br />\nSteadily improving senior Bob<br />\n<br />\nBaltimore's best<br />\n<br />\nDean Uhler named local hoopster of week<br />\nBy KEN LEESER<br />\nHighlighting the varsity<br />\nbasketball action this week are<br />\ntwo home games; Thursday<br />\nagainst Swarthmore, and<br />\nSaturday a contest with Widener<br />\nCollege for first place in the<br />\nMAC-southeastern conference.<br />\nThe big news, however, this week<br />\nwas the announcement by the<br />\nBaltimore Metropolitan Coaches<br />\nAssociation that Hopkins' reserve<br />\ncenter, Dean Uhler, had been<br />\nnamed Baltimore's College Player<br />\nof the Week.<br />\nDean, a 6'8\" junior, who<br />\ngraduated from Franklin High<br />\nSchool here in Baltimore, had<br />\ntwo impressive games last week.<br />\nOne was in a losing effort at the<br />\nNaval Academy, and the second<br />\nwas in a winning cause, home,<br />\nagainst Ursinus.<br />\nThe Navy game saw Dean<br />\nscore 14 points (second high for<br />\nHopkins behind Paul Paytas' 15)<br />\nand haul in seven rebounds (again<br />\nsecond, behind Andy<br />\nScheinfeld's eight).

The<br />\nprofessor added, however, that<br />\nthe mixed student sentiment is<br />\nnothing new, and that reaction is<br />\ntypically varied to introductory<br />\neconomics courses.<br />\nIn light of these statements of<br />\ndisenchantment, many professors<br />\nhave elected to change<br />\ntheintroductory course.

Dr. Glazer began<br />\nhis lecture by formulating<br />\nproblems and questions basic to<br />\nthe analysis of all ethnic group<br />\nleadership, including the<br />\nAmerican Jewish community, his<br />\nown field of research: how to<br />\ndistinguish leaders who are<br /><br />\nwell\u2014known to the outside world<br />\nfrom those prominent only<br />\nwithin the ethnic group itself;<br />\nwho is entitled to exercise<br />\nleadership; what should be the<br />\nstyle of leadership; what conflicts<br />\nare likely to arise between ethnic<br />\ngroup interests and the interest]<br />\nof the public at large?<br />\nDr. Glazer, co-author with<br />\nDaniel Patrick Moynihan of<br />\nBeyond the Melting Pot (a study<br />\nof the major ethnic groups of<br />\nNew York City and their<br />\ninterrelationships) and author of<br />\nthe newly- published work<br />\nAffirmative Discrimination,<br />\napplied those questions to the<br />\nhistory of American Jews.<br />\nHomogeneous<br />\nBetween I 840-1880, according<br />\nto Dr. Glazer, the American<br />\nJewish community was largely<br />\nhomogeneous, composed of<br />\nGerman\u2014speaking Jewish<br />\nimmigrants and their desendants.<br />\nAlmost all were Republican<br />\npolitically, \"reformed\" in<br />\nreligious belief, and very few<br />\nwere artisans. But with the<br />\nimmigration of many East<br />\nEuropean, Yiddish\u2014speaking<br />\nJews to America from the 1880's<br />\nonward, the American Jewish<br />\ncommunity becamemore diverse.<br />\nThe newer immigrants were<br />\nmuch poorer and more intensely<br />\nreligious than the \"German\"<br />\nJews and many had socialist<br />\npolitical leanings.

In a stand-off instance such<br />\nas this, vindicating the guilty is<br />\nthe only answer.

American had come<br />\noff a strong victory over<br />\nWashington and Lee the night<br />\nbefore and was psyched for the<br />\nJays. This forced Coach Frank<br />\nComfort to make some<br />\nlast-minute adjustments in<br />\ncertain events to match Blue Jay<br />\nstrengths with the Eagles'.<br />\nThe meet got off to an<br />\nexcellent start for the Jays as the<br />\n400-yard medley relay team of<br /><br />\nMike Bay, Dean Buchenauer,<br />\nFrank McGovern, and Jim<br />\nSpiering finished with a time of<br />\n3:45.0. This broke the American<br />\npool record of 3:46.6 set two<br />\nyears ago.<br />\nFor the rest of the individual<br />\nevents, each team was limited to<br />\nonly two swimmers due to the<br />\nsmall size of the pool (i.e., 4<br />\nlanes). Freshman Brad Procton<br />\ntook second place in the<br />\n1000-yard freestyle followed by<br />\nTy Lanahan in third.<br />\nThe 200-yard freestyle<br />\nfollowed as freshman Frank<br />\nJones finished second, just ahead<br /><br />\nof Bob Stoever. The 50-yard<br />\nfreestyle was one of the closest<br />\nevents of the afternoon as<br />\nfreshman Roy Beveridge was<br />\nnosed out by .09 seconds by an<br />\nAmerican swimmer.<br />\nThe following event put the<br />\nspotlight on freshman Mike Bay<br />\nwho went on to set two pool<br />\nindividual records, besides his<br />\npart in the record setting time<br />\nturned in by the medley relay<br />\nteam. In the 200-yard individual<br />\nmedley, Bay's time of 2:02.6<br />\nbettered the old mark of 2:04.<br />\nHe then destroyed the old mark<br />\nof 2:02.7 in the 200-yard<br /><br />\nbackstroke as he ran away from<br />\nthe rest of the field and finished<br />\nwith a time of 1:59.3!<br />\nThe diving events saw the top<br />\ntwo spots split between<br />\nHomewooders; freshman Mike<br />\nDiCio and sophomore Jay<br />\nDarrell. Darrell edged out DiCio<br />\nin the one-meter competition<br />\n140.8-139.2 as the next<br />\nAmerican diver posted a score of<br />\n73.4.
