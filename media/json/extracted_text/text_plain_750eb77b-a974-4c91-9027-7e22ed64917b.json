They<br />\nturned around and said, I don't know, what are<br />\nyou going to; do?\" Lipsey explained.<br />\n, When questioned \u2022 about . academic pursuits<br />\nduring the last three weeks, Vice President and<br />\nProvost Dr. William Bevan, said, \"It's too early<br />\nfor an opinion on the success of the intersession.<br />\nI'm not disappointed. We didn't know how<br />\nmany students were interested in it, and once<br />\nwe get the figures in we can evaluate it.\" But<br />\n<br />\na partial survey of faculty and graduate students<br />\nindicates that only a smattering of offerings was<br />\nmade outside of the Psychology Department.<br />\nThe poor showing was variously attributed<br />\nto bad publicity, insufficient time for preparation of courses, the fact that the Academic<br />\nCouncil refused credit to students working during the minimester, and the newness of the idea<br />\nat Hopkins. There appears also to have been<br />\nsome confusion in Dean Carl Swanson's office.<br />\nThe Dean's office, in memo to all faculty members asking them to submit plans for the minimester, promised that publicity would be forth.<br />\ncoming. No schedule of course offerings was<br />\never distributed.<br />\nThe courses offered by the Psychology Department covered a wide range of topics from<br />\nthe purely practical \"Computer Practicum\" under Dr. Green to the philosophical \"Structure<br />\nand Content\" dealing with the separation between form and meaning in psychological models.<br />\nSeveral courses dealt with various works of Sigmund Freud, and four others covered various<br />\naspects of language and communication. In all,<br />\ntwo faculty members and eleven graduate students taught fifteen courses which met on the<br />\naverage for four hours a week. In addition, fourteen colloquium meetings were held in which<br />\nfaculty members described current departmental<br />\n(continued on page 7)<br />\n<br />\nCouncil Drops P.E. For Non-Strikers;<br />\nCharry Calls Administration Childish<br />\nBy MICHAEL HILL<br />\nPhysical Education, the last University-wide<br />\nrequirement for graduation, has fallen to the<br />\nPressure of a student boycott.<br />\nThe Academic Council voted to withdraw<br />\nthe one-year requirement following a recommendation from the Committee on Student<br />\nAffairs. However, in an attempt to keep from<br />\nrewarding the boycotters, the Council made this<br />\neffective only for students entering after January, 1970.<br />\nAnyone who completed one semester of<br />\nPhysical education last semester is considered<br />\nto have satisfied the previous one-year requirement. Those people who failed last semester,<br />\nhowever, will be required to make up their failure in order to graduate. The freshman boycotters, numbering more than two hundred, are<br />\nin this latter group.<br />\nIn response to this action, Dave Charry,<br />\nPresident of the freshman class and leader of the<br />\nboycott, is writing Dean Swanson, protesting<br />\nthat the make-up requirement is merely punishment for the boycotters and should be eliminated.<br />\nCharry further argues that since the administration has agreed that the physical education<br />\nprogram is poor, it is ridiculous to require students to continue with it. Charry also points<br />\nout that this action is not consistent with the<br />\n<br />\nway in which the foriegn language requirement<br />\nwas removed.<br />\nAccording to Charry, \"the administration is<br />\nacting childish about this whole thing\"; he claimed that \"all but ten or fifteen\" of the boycotters<br />\nare refusing to sign up for the make-up sessions.<br />\nThe letter will be signed by the three freshman<br />\nclass officers, Charry, Paul Hyduke, Vice-President, and Jeff Prebluda, Secretary-Treasurer.<br />\nThe committee on Student Affairs, in recommending that the requirement be removed,<br />\noverrode the recommendation of its sub-committee on Physical Education which had reported<br />\nthat the requirement should be retained, but the<br />\nofferings should be improved.<br />\nThe Committee of Student Affairs disclosed<br />\nits decision at an open meeting held before the<br />\nholidays, at which Dr. John Mann commended<br />\n\u2022<br />\nthe boycotters.<br />\nThe Department of Physical Education will<br />\ncontinue to offer courses on an elective basis.<br />\nThey will be open to all full-time graduate and<br />\nundergraduate students. This policy begins with<br />\nthis semester which will be divided into three<br />\nfour five week sessions.<br />\nOfferings for the first session, which will be<br />\nfrom January 26 through February 24, are<br />\nweight training, swimming, paddle racquets and<br />\nsquash, badminton and bowling. Freshmen were<br />\nallowed to sign up for these during the registra-<br />\n<br />\nDavid Chaffy, Freshman class president, has protested<br />\nthat the gym requirement changes are being used to<br />\npunish the phys. ed. boycotters.<br />\nplc by hoffmann<br />\n<br />\ntion period. All other students are requested to<br />\ncall the athletic office to arrange scheduling.<br />\nStudents who failed both sessions offered<br />\nin the fall term will be required to make up two<br />\nsessions this semester, or at some later date;<br />\nstudents failing only one session must make up<br />\nonly one. None of this, according to current<br />\nrulings, will be retro-active. Thus those students<br />\nwho have failed physical education in the past<br />\nby taking more than the allowable number of<br />\ncuts will still be required to complete the course<br />\nin order to graduate.<br />\nFreshmen, asked to comment on the new<br />\nruling, indicated that they did not intend to sign<br />\nup for the courses offered, but did want to continue to use the gymnasium's facilities.<br />\n<br />\n\fPAGE 2<br />\n<br />\nJan; 97, 1970<br />\n<br />\nNEWS\u2014LETTER<br />\n<br />\nTo Insure Our Rights:Writ of Habeas Data?'<br />\nA leading legal scholar suggested<br />\nearlier this month that a new \"writ<br />\nof habeas data' is required to insure<br />\nindividual rights in the computer age.<br />\nIn a speech prepared for delivery at<br />\na Hopkins-Brookings computer symposium in Washington, D.C., Alan F. Westin, professor of public law and government at Columbia University, said that<br />\nman had progressed over the centuries<br />\nfrom the status of a subject of the ruler<br />\nto that of a citizen in a constitutional<br />\nstate.<br />\n\"What I think we must be careful<br />\nto avert,\" he said, \"is a situation in<br />\nwhich the press of government for systematic information and the powerful<br />\ntechnology of computers reverse this<br />\nhistorical process in the second half<br />\nof the 20th century.\"<br />\n<br />\n\"You Have The Data\"<br />\nWestin commented that possibly the<br />\ngreatest legal device to facilitate the<br />\nmovement from subject to citizen in<br />\nEngland was the writ of habeas corpus,<br />\nthe command of the courts to the Crown<br />\nto produce the body of a person being<br />\nheld and to justify his imprisonment.<br />\n\"What we may need in the electronic<br />\nage,\" he said, \"is a writ of habeas<br />\ndata, commanding government and powerful private organizations to produce<br />\nthe data they have collected and are<br />\nusing to make judgments about an individual, and to justify their using it.<br />\n\"If the Great Writ of English constitutional development could bring kings<br />\nto the rule of law, perhaps a new Great<br />\nWrit can do the same for the computer.\"<br />\nWestin's speech was prepared for<br />\nthe<br />\nsymposium, \"Computers, Communications, and the Public Interest,\"<br />\n<br />\nsponsored by Hopkins and the Brookings Institution, in Washington.<br />\nDavid L. Bazelon, chief judge of the<br />\nU.S. Court of Appeals for the Washington, D.C. Circuit, presided at the symposium. Others asked to comment on<br />\nWestin's talk were Charles Schultze,<br />\nformer director of the Bureau of the<br />\nBudget, and Ralph Nader, the research<br />\nlawyer who has spearheaded efforts in<br />\nbehalf of consumer and individual rights.<br />\nWestin told the symposium that the<br />\nclaim to personal and group privacy<br />\ncannot be absolute in a \"real-world<br />\nenvironment,\" and added:<br />\n<br />\nInformation-Rich<br />\n\"We have to be clear about the functions served by privacy and due process in a democratic society, and consider how to re-constitute those functions in a high-technology, informationrich age.\"<br />\nHe said there was still time in the<br />\nevolution of information-gathering processes to think through the privacy<br />\nand due process issues. Commenting<br />\nthat these are not technical questions<br />\nbut matters of public policy, he said:<br />\n\"If public policy declares that individuals should have notice of information put into systems about them,<br />\nopportunities to see and challenge the<br />\nrecords ,before the administration of<br />\nthe system, and some appeal to a higher authority, system designers can provide highly imaginative ways to arrange<br />\nthe hardware and software to make this<br />\npossible. Indeed, they can do this far<br />\nbetter with computerized data systems<br />\nthan with manual files.\"<br />\nWestin proposed some approaches that<br />\nmight be considered to insure individual<br />\nrights in the further development of in-<br />\n<br />\nformation-gathering processes:<br />\n-- \"careful empirical studies of the<br />\nparticular computerized data systems<br />\nthat are evolving, with attention to their<br />\nprocedures for protecting privacy and<br />\ndue process.\"<br />\n-- Congressional investigation, particularly since the federal government's<br />\ngrants-in-aid programs are a major<br />\nstimulant and standard-setter for many<br />\nsuch efforts by local, state and regional<br />\ngovernments.<br />\n-- action by regulatory agencies(possibly the new Telecommunications Agency that is under consideration could<br />\nhave basic jurisdiction over the issue<br />\nof insuring the rights of citizens in new<br />\ncomputer-communication systems).<br />\n-- a central registry for governmental databanks and those private databanks that are used for purposes such<br />\nas credit, employment and insurance<br />\ninvestigations.<br />\n<br />\nThis calendar is prepared by the Office of<br />\nPublic Information, Shriver Hall.

A third was heard to<br />\ncomplain that he had spent \"nine bucks<br />\nto get a picture book of all of Crawford's friends.\"<br />\nJoel Crawford, the book's editor and<br />\nChief photographer, is receiving most<br />\nof the criticism both from members<br />\n<br />\nof the staff and from subscribers. Although many of the financial difficulties<br />\nof the publication can be attributed to<br />\ntwo thefts of photographic equipment<br />\nvalued at more than $1800, the necessity of spending that much money for<br />\nequipment has been questioned. The<br />\npublication,,despite an added $1000 appropriation by the Student Council, owes<br />\nthe University $2115, according to Robert<br />\nBilgrave, Director of Student Affairs.<br />\n<br />\nRoughly Six?<br />\nThe 1969 yearbook can be roughly<br />\ndivided into six parts. Sixty pages<br />\neach carry one photograph of a selected individual in the administration, faculty or student bod37. Six and one-half<br />\npages are devoted to the graduating<br />\nclass. Between the two sections are<br />\nseveral parts devoted to mood shots of<br />\nthe campus, the occupation of Homewood<br />\nHouse last spring, the Lacrosse season<br />\nand the various extracurricular activities on campus.<br />\nThe only written material in the book,<br />\naside from the haphazard identification<br />\nof those photographed, is two short,<br />\nuncredited poems and a statement at<br />\nthe end of the senior sectionwhich reads,<br />\n\"The editor regrets that the senior section does not contain the usual detailed<br />\ninformation for each graduate.\" Rumor<br />\nhas it that Crawford was retaliating against the class for failing to contribute<br />\nits usual $1000 for publication of the<br />\nyearbook.<br />\n<br />\nbook can be published at all. His plans<br />\ninclude expanding the book to 224 pages<br />\n(versus last year's 152), playing down<br />\nthe use of photographs in favor of a<br />\nmore broadly based commentary about<br />\nthe campus, and giving the students<br />\nmore of \"what they want, rather than<br />\nwhat the editor wants.\" Also, Adams<br />\nclaims, \"the senior section will be expanded by 350%--which will only bring<br />\nus back to where we always were.\"<br />\nAdams is the first editor in several<br />\nyears who is not a photographer and he<br />\nfeels that this may be the factor which<br />\nwill help distinguish this yearbook from<br />\nrecent ones. The past three editions of<br />\nthe yearbook have caused a storm of<br />\ncontroversy over their merits and representation of student life. Adams<br />\nhopes to break this routine by concen-<br />\n<br />\ntrating heavily on lay-out, social and<br />\npolitical commentary and a tighter organization of material.<br />\n\"The Hullabaloo,\" Adams says, \"is<br />\noperating under the stigma of past years.<br />\nFrom talking to others we think we have<br />\nwhat they want. We hope we don't crunch<br />\nunder the weight of non-subscription.\"<br />\nThe fixed costs of the publication are<br />\napproximately $5,000. If the present<br />\nyearbook gets the same number of subscriptions as last year's 550, Adams<br />\nis confident that he can come out \"in<br />\nthe black.\" If he does not come close<br />\nto that number, the book may not be<br />\npublished at all. \"If the students don't<br />\nwant it and don't buy it, there's no sense<br />\nin continuing the damn book, is there?\"<br />\nAs of Saturday, the Hullabaloo had sold<br />\n350 subscriptions.<br />\n<br />\n224 Pages<br />\n111111111101\"._<br />\nThe finished product: Joel Crawford's Yearpic by lemm<br />\nbook of 1969.<br />\n<br />\nJohn Adams, the yearbook's present<br />\neditor, is currently involved in an allout campaign to raise enough subscription money to ensure that this year's<br />\n<br />\nFellowship<br />\nEach fellowship for single fellows has a total value of $4,540.<br />\nBeginning this June, fellows will<br />\nserve a three-month internship<br />\neither with a department of the<br />\nState Government of Alabama,<br />\nKentucky or Tennessee or with<br />\na federal<br />\nagency in the South,<br />\nsuch as the TVA.

The Psychology Department, under the direction of<br />\ngraduate student Mark Lipsey, and Professor James Deese,<br />\nput together a program that was ambitious, well planned,<br />\nand interesting to the 70-80 students who signed up for it.<br />\nThe Psychology Department's performance speaks well<br />\nfor the Department and the individual faculty merfibers<br />\nand graduate students who participated. It is also encouraging to note that the organization and impetus for the program came from the graduate students. Graduates are<br />\noften accused of not caring what kind of undergraduate<br />\neducation is provided at Hopkins. A few more performances like this would be a welcome contradiction of these<br />\naccusations.<br />\nThe Psychology faculty also deserves praise. The colloquium series featured talks by fourteen members of the<br />\nDepartment, each speaking on a subject within his field of<br />\nexpertise. For the first time in memory, Flopkins came<br />\nclose to fulfilling the promises made in the undergraduate<br />\ncatalogue.<br />\nThe intersession also reminded us of some of Hopkins'<br />\ndisturbing characteristics. The great majority of Hopkins'<br />\n29 departments made no effort to make the three week<br />\nperiod instructive, interesting or in any way valuable for<br />\ngraduates or undergraduates. In November, Dean Swanson<br />\nsent a letter around to all departments, asking what had<br />\nbeen done for the intersession and recommending that<br />\nplans be made to organize programs. Apparently, the letter<br />\nwas widely disregarded.<br />\nCertainly, this should come as no surprise. An uninterrupted three weeks of research must be attractive to<br />\nHopkins professors; the General Assembly voted last<br />\nMarch to charge students no tuition for the mini-semester<br />\nand to pay faculty members no salaries for teaching. But<br />\nthe example of the Psychology Department has shown<br />\nthat intersession could be the most valuable three weeks in<br />\nthe academic year.<br />\nIf salaries must be paid, or tuition charged to involve<br />\nmore students in truly worthwhile programs, we would<br />\nlike to see it done. Whatever need be done to get Hopkins'<br />\ndepartments to show some interest in undergraduate<br />\neducation should be on the top of the University's priority list. Undergraduates reacted well to the programs<br />\nwhich were offered. The classes were lively, informal and<br />\nenjoyable. If the Psychology offerings are regarded as an<br />\nexperiment, the results certainly indicate that more effort<br />\nby other departments is needed.<br />\n<br />\nThe Tuesday Edition<br />\nThis is the first time in the past several decades that the<br />\nNews-Letter is attempting a twice-weekly publication<br />\nschedule. The last effort ended, ultimately, in failure.<br />\nWe hope not only to make the venture succeed financially, but journalistically and aesthetically as well. Coverage of the campus, the medical institutions and the city<br />\nwill be expanded and we hope to maintain a greater continuity in our reporting.

Snow wrote that all intellectual pursuits could be divided into two categories, the<br />\nscientific and the humanistic.<br />\nBiologists, physicists and others who operate<br />\nthrough the scientific method were, he said, so<br />\ntotally isolated from literature, the arts and<br />\nthose that fashioned their lives around these<br />\nthings, that the resulting Two Cultures were<br />\nnever to be reconciled again.<br />\nSeveral years later, Jacque Barzun wrote that<br />\nSnow was wrong. The humanities, Barzun wrote,<br />\nwere merely pathetic imitators of the sciences<br />\nand Snow's Two Cultures were in fact one<br />\nscientific culture. The intellectual focus of the<br />\npast decade has shown us that Barzun was right.<br />\nNowhere is the pervasive influence of science<br />\nmore readily observed than in the university,<br />\nin particular our own.<br />\nThe scientific method, whereby something is<br />\nbroken down, examined and reassembled through<br />\nthe lenses of a particular theory, has engulfed<br />\nthe humanities. Whether it be a novel, an objet<br />\nd' art or a piece of music, it is today assumed<br />\nthat one cannot understand without minute examination of every detail and facet. Observe the<br />\nabsurd lengths to which literary scholars go in<br />\nanalyzing a novel. Faulkner, for one, found this<br />\nextremely amusing. One scholar spent a lifetime examing the use of a particular color in<br />\nthe writings of Joyce. Similarly, a great architect called homes \"machines for living\" with<br />\nslight mention of color and space. Art is presently captivated by geometric constructs of every<br />\nvariety. Euclid would marvel at the retrogression.<br />\n<br />\nSociological Tool<br />\nThe social studies are now the social sciences<br />\nand examine the mysteries of human groups and<br />\nthe human psyche by means of the quantitative<br />\napproach. Philosophy is highly technical and concerned with semantics. The primary tool of the<br />\nSociologist is the survey. Political Science today<br />\nis meaningless without quantitative analysis and<br />\nPsychologists have turned to the Norway rat<br />\nfor the study of man.<br />\nIf the sciences corrupted the humanities and<br />\n\"soft\" sciences, they did so with the aid and<br />\nencouragement of the universities. Everywhere,<br />\nand painfully obviously at this school, the humanities dwindle in size each year. The reason<br />\nfor this is obvious. Humanits, literary scholars,<br />\nphilosophers, musicians, painters and the like<br />\naren't in vogue; science is. Moreover, humanists<br />\n<br />\nFIRST j H.APIED<br />\ntatil5LF,<br />\n<br />\ndon't solve problems, cure cancer, split atoms<br />\nand build bridges. Most of what they produce<br />\nrequires taste in order to appreciate.<br />\nAdd to this the fact that the university is a<br />\nbureaucracry, with departments representing the<br />\nvarious disciplines and all requiring more money;<br />\none has a situation in which those departments<br />\nwith the most people, money and status receive<br />\nthe biggest slices of the budgetary pie.<br />\n<br />\nSolution To Atrophy<br />\nThe only solution to the atrophy of the humanities is the willful and voluntary act of the<br />\nseveral strong departments in the university of<br />\nfeeding other than their own gaping mouths.<br />\nSuch an event is difficult to imagine. It would<br />\nrequire, perhaps, the use of laboratory equipment that is not the newest, the subsidization<br />\nof fewer grants for crucial scientific programs.<br />\nThe men, ideas, courses and atmosphere that<br />\nwould result from the strengthening of the arts<br />\nwould benefit all in the university community.<br />\nIn viewing the common cultural products each<br />\nday consumed by the American people, a depressing picture results. Since we cannot adequately<br />\ngauge the influence of the university on society,<br />\nwe can at least decide that there is some.<br />\nIn idolizing the sciences, both the university and<br />\nthe community have created a vacuum in which<br />\nthe Jacquelin Susanns are able to heap their<br />\ntrash on the cultural consumer. The universities<br />\nmust ask themselves to what degree they are<br />\nresponsible for this cultural waste.<br />\nStudents, also, are unwittingly abetting this<br />\ntrend. The call for relevance in a university<br />\ncurriculum is usually directed at the non-humanistic departments. After all, music, literature<br />\nand such studies are not only in dollars and<br />\ncents, the commodities offered by the humanities<br />\nare not readily measured. The apparent lack of<br />\nstudent concern for study in these areas reveals<br />\na deep materialism of a different variety.<br />\nBecause of all these reasons, the artist has<br />\nnever been so completely isolated from the community which studies his work. It was not always<br />\nso.<br />\nThough we live in a culture dominated by<br />\nscience and partly because of the order of<br />\npriorities in the American university, only the<br />\ninstitutions which created this situation can reverse it.

We have presented<br />\nthe coach's side, but Director of Athletics Marshall Turner, hindered by a<br />\nminimal athletic budget, has to look at<br />\nthese proposals differently.<br />\nTurner admits that \"it certainlywould<br />\nbe nice to include a holiday tournament<br />\nfor the basketball team.\" Yet, he feels<br />\nthat the schedule should not be dependent on this every year.<br />\n<br />\nHe does, however, feel that the present<br />\nschedule should be upped by one or two<br />\ngames. Turner's conservatism stems<br />\nfrom his attempts to maximize the<br />\namount of participation with the minimal<br />\nathletic budget. This unfortunate situation has plagued the athletic center for at<br />\nleast the last ten years; and its origin<br />\nprobably goes much further back in<br />\nHopkins' lore.<br />\nTwo factors further<br />\ncomplicate<br />\nTurner's<br />\nseemingly insurmountable<br />\ntask. The first is the effect inflation<br />\nhas, straining an already heavily taxed<br />\nbudget. The second is the fact that<br />\nscheduling, being as complicated as it is<br />\nwith games having to be scheduled in<br />\nTurner's words \"two, sometimes three<br />\nyears in advance\" does not coincide<br />\nwith budget allottments for the following<br />\n<br />\nWrestlers Are Tough,<br />\nFace Tough Opposition<br />\nBy ED BRETHAUER<br />\nThe Hopkins' Varsity Wrestling Team<br />\nhas competed in five matches so far<br />\nthis season, and has won three of those,<br />\nhaving beaten Washington College (2413), Loyola (26-13), and Dickinson (2318).<br />\nAs one can see from these scores,<br />\nHopkins is 2-0 in the Mason-Dixon<br />\nConference so far, with two tough matches coming up against Western Maryland and Towson State. Victories in<br />\nthese two matches would definitely make<br />\nup for losses to Delaware (40-0) and<br />\nLebanon Valley (30-8).<br />\nThe team has been good despite the<br />\nlatter scores, as can be witnessed in<br />\nthe records of several individuals. Nick<br />\nPratt has won three matches all by<br />\npins, of which the most notable was<br />\nhis victory over Frank Filippi of Washington College in the 190 LB. class.<br />\nCarl Betta, in a lower weight class,<br />\nhas won two of his matches, while Jeff<br />\nTurshen has also done an outstanding<br />\njob for the team.<br />\n<br />\nJack Haneman has done a fine job<br />\nas captain of the team, winning some<br />\nvery close matches, such as his 3-2<br />\ndecision over Steve Golding of WashThe most improved<br />\nington College.<br />\nwrestler so far this season, though,<br />\nwould have to be Bob Sanborn, who<br />\nwas credited with a fall against Loyola,<br />\nand a 14-3 decision over Kneeland of<br />\nDickinson.<br />\nThe big problem for the varsity this<br />\nseason has been the schedule itself,<br />\nwhich was set up before the academic<br />\nyear was reorganized. Thus, the varsity had a lot of its wrestlers taken<br />\naway during the exam period, forcing<br />\nthe team to forfeit a great deal of<br />\nmatches. For example, in the Lebanon<br />\nValley meet, Hopkins gave up fifteen<br />\npoints immediately by forfeiting the<br />\n118,126, and Heavyweight matches. The<br />\nsituation did not get better directly<br />\nafter the exam period, though, because<br />\nthose boys who were forced to leave<br />\nthe team during this period did not return in January.<br />\n<br />\nschool year which are made in the<br />\nSpring and are worked out in the preceeding winter.<br />\nTherefore, Turner is forced to make<br />\ncommitments before he knows what his<br />\nbudget will be. He is reluctant to make<br />\nfurther commitments on the grounds that<br />\nthere is no assurance that Dean Kimball<br />\nwould approve budgetary requests for<br />\nsuch events as a Christmas tournament.<br />\nAdmittedly, in past year's briefings about<br />\nthe budget that would eventually be submitted Turner has been discouraged from<br />\nincluding such a category. He is also<br />\nreluctant, because the inclusion of such<br />\na tournament might result in having to<br />\ncut down some other aspect of the athletic program - a move which he vehemently resists.<br />\nTurner feels that such a sludge fund,<br />\nIf you want to call it that, should not be<br />\nalloted for one specific sport. If such<br />\na fund were to come into existence, one<br />\nyear it might go to the basketball team,<br />\nthe next the swimming team,thenwrestling squad, and maybe a Southern trip<br />\nfor the golf or tennis team, etc. Some<br />\nlogical rotation would be set up to give<br />\nall the sports a fair share of the pie.<br />\nIn upcoming meetings of the Athletic<br />\nCommittee, the topic of post season<br />\nplay will be taken up. We sincerely<br />\nhope that their discussions will include<br />\nsome serious talk of this whole matter<br />\nof a contingency fund and Hopkins'sponsored tournaments.<br />\nSo where do these money worries lead<br />\n'us? Right back to the question of a city<br />\ntournament and a Christmas tourney for<br />\nthe basketball team.When asked about the<br />\ncity tournament, Turner mentioned that<br />\ninformal inquiries with Loyola were met<br />\nby a less than enthusiastic response.<br />\nLoyola, which has played in the Civic<br />\nCenter several times, has been the victim of sports promoters and is unwilling to get involved unless it be through<br />\n\"institutional impetus\". Turner insists<br />\nthat Hopkins will not take the initiative<br />\nsince he does not have the time to devote<br />\nto the necessary legwork.<br />\nHowever, he leaves the door openwhen<br />\nhe says that Hopkins would not be totally<br />\n<br />\nDROP OUT?

He was<br />\nless than enthusiastic about Hopkins'<br />\ninterest if the initiative were to come<br />\nfrom Baltimore University.<br />\nAlthough the formal excuse is that B.U.<br />\nis not fully accredited, an underlying<br />\nreason is that in the past B.U. has been<br />\nguilty of \"cutting corners\". When asked<br />\nto explain, Turner sighted several infractions such as playing students under.<br />\n\"assumed names\", the playing of night<br />\nschool students, and the almost nonexistent academic requirements of the<br />\ninstitution. Turner points out that this<br />\nsituation has changed in the past few<br />\nyears, but still remained wary of a<br />\ntournament bid from this direction.<br />\nOn the other side of a rather gloomy<br />\npicture, Turner notes \"that it is conceivable that Hopkins might join with<br />\nLoyola in bringing in two teams to play<br />\non the last weekend before Christmas,\"<br />\nbut by Turner's own estimates this is<br />\nat least two years away. Nothing definite<br />\nhas been set up. Problems in paying for<br />\ntransportation and room and board have<br />\nalso kept Hopkins from participating in<br />\nother holiday tournaments. Feelers had<br />\nbeen received from Washington and Lee<br />\nin Virginia, and from Sacred Heart<br />\nUniversity in Bridgeport, Conn.

In the<br />\nwords of Ellery Woodworth, Hopkins is<br />\n\"gearing up\" for the biggest capital<br />\ncampaign in its history.<br />\nWoodworth is Hopkins' Vice-President<br />\nfor Development and his office in Homewood House is the headquarters for the<br />\ndevelopment campaign. His responsibility is \"to organize the development<br />\npossibilities here and bring to Hopkins<br />\nthe experienced staff to plan and prosecute the campaign successfully.\"<br />\n<br />\nthough the federal government is becoming less and less inclined to pick<br />\nup the tab. The foundations, which had .<br />\npreviously contributed a great deal toward the support of programs at Hopkins,<br />\nwere hit hard by the recent tax reform<br />\nbill. Increasingly, support for private<br />\nhigher education will have to come<br />\nfrom private sources. It is these sources which the coming campaign hopes<br />\nto reach, and according to Woodworth,<br />\nthe stakes are high. \"The whole future<br />\nof this institution depends on our setting<br />\na goal and meeting it,\" he said.<br />\nThe setting of that goal is the affair<br />\nof President Gordon and the Board of<br />\nTrustees. At present, there is no word<br />\non what the goal will be. Woodworth<br />\nstated that the goal may be \"substantially in excess of $100 million.\" He<br />\nemphasized that this was his personal<br />\nestimate.<br />\n<br />\nMoney Trouble<br />\nThe major development program will<br />\ninvolve all divisions of the University<br />\nand the Hospital. Central to the campaign is the notion that it will end in<br />\n1976, Hopkins' centennial year. Woodworth, who came to Hopkins seven monthis ago, estimates that the total development program now being planned may<br />\ncontinue considerably past the centennial<br />\nmark. He visualizes a ten-year program<br />\nof development beginning with a capital<br />\ncampaign lasting approximately five<br />\nyears. At present it appears that the<br />\ncampaign will begin in 1971.<br />\n<br />\nWilliam Bevan on what the University's<br />\nneeds will be in the coming years. Bevan<br />\nwill have to weigh and sift all plans,<br />\nrequests and programs to see which qualify for a place in the list of the University's \"prime needs.\"<br />\nAll of the information from Bevan's<br />\noffice and from John Price Jones Company will go to President Gordon and<br />\nthe Board of Trustees, who will then<br />\ndetermine the goal of the funds campaign.<br />\nOnce the goal is determined, Woodworth and the Development staff will<br />\nattempt to figure what type of contributions are needed. Before the campaign<br />\nis announced to the public, \"special<br />\ngift solicitation\" will begin. This entails approaching wealthy potential contributors and giving them \"first shot\"<br />\nat the lists of what is needed.<br />\n<br />\nSpecial Gifts<br />\nPrime Needs<br />\nThe goal will be determined by two<br />\nmajor factors. The first is the outcome<br />\nof a study now being conducted by John<br />\nPrice Jones Comapny, of New York.<br />\nThe firm has had much experience in<br />\nthe field of fund-raising for colleges<br />\nand universities. It is presently attempting to determine the amounts of money<br />\nwhich Hopkins might raise and from<br />\nwhat sources. Its report should be presented to Hopkins around March 1, and<br />\ncontain the firm's recommendatons on<br />\na \"feasible\" fund raising goal.<br />\nThe second major factor in determining the goal of the drive will be<br />\nthe report of the deans, faculty and<br />\n<br />\nBut the development program and<br />\ncapital campaign is hardly due delay in<br />\nthe to a casual approach. Hopkins is<br />\nin trouble for money and it looks as<br />\n<br />\nSpecial gifts are generally the largest<br />\nof the contributions and serve to make<br />\nup a large percentage of the final campaign intake.<br />\nOnce the campaign is made public, all<br />\npotential contributors will receive a copy<br />\nof the \"case statement.\" This is a<br />\ndocument describing the campaign, Hopkins and future needs of the university.<br />\nThe first prose section is to be followed<br />\nby a rather detailed list of the needs<br />\nof Hopkins and the possible contributions<br />\nto be made; the list can be completed<br />\nonly. after the \"prime needs\" of the<br />\nUniversity have been decided upon.<br />\nThe case statement will give the<br />\n<br />\n'<br />\nc<br />\nt<br />\n<br />\n\\--;\u2022\u2022<br />\n:<br />\n<br />\nENGINEERS-SCIENTISTS-MATHEMATICIANS<br />\n<br />\n<Th4<br />\n<br />\n<<br />\n2<br />\n:<br />\n<br />\n<<br />\n<br />\n<<br />\n2<br />\n:<br />\n<br />\nLINK YOUR COUNTRY'S FUTURE<br />\nWITH YOUR OWN<br />\n<br />\nWINTER PENGUINS<br />\n...NEW<br />\nCAMPUS<br />\n<br />\n3'<br />\n<br />\n<J:<br />\n<br />\n<D:<br />\n<br />\nGREENBELT, MD.<br />\n<br />\nShopping List<br />\nFeingold is presently working on a.<br />\ndraft of the first section of the statement. Woodworth hired Feingold for the<br />\nDevelopment Staff three months ago.Before the end of next year, the staff will<br />\nexpand from its present size of fifteen<br />\nprofessionals to a total of thirty. The<br />\nnumber of professionals does not include clerical help or volunteers.<br />\nOne of the most important considerations in a campaign such as this is<br />\nthe \"kind\" of contributions received.<br />\nWoodworth and Feingold emphasized that<br />\nlarge private contributions are the best<br />\nkind to receive. The industrial andfoundation contributions are made only for<br />\nvery specific purposes and only after<br />\ndetailed prospecti and proposals are<br />\nsubmitted. Private donations, on the<br />\nother hand, are often made without<br />\nrestrictions as to the use of the funds.<br />\nThe campaign will concentrate on these<br />\nprivate contributions instead of foundation grants which have provided a<br />\nlarge percentage of program revenue in<br />\nthe past.<br />\n<br />\nTV<br />\n\\MAA MMWMMM6<br />\n()<br />\nf)0<br />\n<br />\nGROW WITH THE SPACE AGE AT<br />\n<br />\nGODDARD<br />\nSPACE<br />\nFLIGHT<br />\nCENTER<br />\n<br />\n\"price\" of a building, a faculty chair,<br />\na continuing scholarship, etc. The con-:<br />\n.tributor then knows that if he wants a<br />\nbuilding in his name, it will cost him<br />\n$10 million.

However, in an attempt to keep from<br />\nrewarding the boycotters, the Council made this<br />\neffective only for students entering after January, 1970.<br />\nAnyone who completed one semester of<br />\nPhysical education last semester is considered<br />\nto have satisfied the previous one-year requirement. Those people who failed last semester,<br />\nhowever, will be required to make up their failure in order to graduate. The freshman boycotters, numbering more than two hundred, are<br />\nin this latter group.<br />\nIn response to this action, Dave Charry,<br />\nPresident of the freshman class and leader of the<br />\nboycott, is writing Dean Swanson, protesting<br />\nthat the make-up requirement is merely punishment for the boycotters and should be eliminated.<br />\nCharry further argues that since the administration has agreed that the physical education<br />\nprogram is poor, it is ridiculous to require students to continue with it. Charry also points<br />\nout that this action is not consistent with the<br /><br />\nway in which the foriegn language requirement<br />\nwas removed.<br />\nAccording to Charry, \"the administration is<br />\nacting childish about this whole thing\"; he claimed that \"all but ten or fifteen\" of the boycotters<br />\nare refusing to sign up for the make-up sessions.<br />\nThe letter will be signed by the three freshman<br />\nclass officers, Charry, Paul Hyduke, Vice-President, and Jeff Prebluda, Secretary-Treasurer.<br />\nThe committee on Student Affairs, in recommending that the requirement be removed,<br />\noverrode the recommendation of its sub-committee on Physical Education which had reported<br />\nthat the requirement should be retained, but the<br />\nofferings should be improved.<br />\nThe Committee of Student Affairs disclosed<br />\nits decision at an open meeting held before the<br />\nholidays, at which Dr. John Mann commended<br />\n\u2022<br />\nthe boycotters.<br />\nThe Department of Physical Education will<br />\ncontinue to offer courses on an elective basis.<br />\nThey will be open to all full-time graduate and<br />\nundergraduate students.

Westin, professor of public law and government at Columbia University, said that<br />\nman had progressed over the centuries<br />\nfrom the status of a subject of the ruler<br />\nto that of a citizen in a constitutional<br />\nstate.<br />\n\"What I think we must be careful<br />\nto avert,\" he said, \"is a situation in<br />\nwhich the press of government for systematic information and the powerful<br />\ntechnology of computers reverse this<br />\nhistorical process in the second half<br />\nof the 20th century.\"<br /><br />\n\"You Have The Data\"<br />\nWestin commented that possibly the<br />\ngreatest legal device to facilitate the<br />\nmovement from subject to citizen in<br />\nEngland was the writ of habeas corpus,<br />\nthe command of the courts to the Crown<br />\nto produce the body of a person being<br />\nheld and to justify his imprisonment.<br />\n\"What we may need in the electronic<br />\nage,\" he said, \"is a writ of habeas<br />\ndata, commanding government and powerful private organizations to produce<br />\nthe data they have collected and are<br />\nusing to make judgments about an individual, and to justify their using it.<br />\n\"If the Great Writ of English constitutional development could bring kings<br />\nto the rule of law, perhaps a new Great<br />\nWrit can do the same for the computer.\"<br />\nWestin's speech was prepared for<br />\nthe<br />\nsymposium, \"Computers, Communications, and the Public Interest,\"<br /><br />\nsponsored by Hopkins and the Brookings Institution, in Washington.<br />\nDavid L. Bazelon, chief judge of the<br />\nU.S. Court of Appeals for the Washington, D.C. Circuit, presided at the symposium. Others asked to comment on<br />\nWestin's talk were Charles Schultze,<br />\nformer director of the Bureau of the<br />\nBudget, and Ralph Nader, the research<br />\nlawyer who has spearheaded efforts in<br />\nbehalf of consumer and individual rights.<br />\nWestin told the symposium that the<br />\nclaim to personal and group privacy<br />\ncannot be absolute in a \"real-world<br />\nenvironment,\" and added:<br /><br />\nInformation-Rich<br />\n\"We have to be clear about the functions served by privacy and due process in a democratic society, and consider how to re-constitute those functions in a high-technology, informationrich age.\"<br />\nHe said there was still time in the<br />\nevolution of information-gathering processes to think through the privacy<br />\nand due process issues. Commenting<br />\nthat these are not technical questions<br />\nbut matters of public policy, he said:<br />\n\"If public policy declares that individuals should have notice of information put into systems about them,<br />\nopportunities to see and challenge the<br />\nrecords ,before the administration of<br />\nthe system, and some appeal to a higher authority, system designers can provide highly imaginative ways to arrange<br />\nthe hardware and software to make this<br />\npossible. Indeed, they can do this far<br />\nbetter with computerized data systems<br />\nthan with manual files.\"<br />\nWestin proposed some approaches that<br />\nmight be considered to insure individual<br />\nrights in the further development of in-<br /><br />\nformation-gathering processes:<br />\n-- \"careful empirical studies of the<br />\nparticular computerized data systems<br />\nthat are evolving, with attention to their<br />\nprocedures for protecting privacy and<br />\ndue process.\"<br />\n-- Congressional investigation, particularly since the federal government's<br />\ngrants-in-aid programs are a major<br />\nstimulant and standard-setter for many<br />\nsuch efforts by local, state and regional<br />\ngovernments.<br />\n-- action by regulatory agencies(possibly the new Telecommunications Agency that is under consideration could<br />\nhave basic jurisdiction over the issue<br />\nof insuring the rights of citizens in new<br />\ncomputer-communication systems).<br />\n-- a central registry for governmental databanks and those private databanks that are used for purposes such<br />\nas credit, employment and insurance<br />\ninvestigations.<br /><br />\nThis calendar is prepared by the Office of<br />\nPublic Information, Shriver Hall.

A third was heard to<br />\ncomplain that he had spent \"nine bucks<br />\nto get a picture book of all of Crawford's friends.\"<br />\nJoel Crawford, the book's editor and<br />\nChief photographer, is receiving most<br />\nof the criticism both from members<br /><br />\nof the staff and from subscribers. Although many of the financial difficulties<br />\nof the publication can be attributed to<br />\ntwo thefts of photographic equipment<br />\nvalued at more than $1800, the necessity of spending that much money for<br />\nequipment has been questioned. The<br />\npublication,,despite an added $1000 appropriation by the Student Council, owes<br />\nthe University $2115, according to Robert<br />\nBilgrave, Director of Student Affairs.<br /><br />\nRoughly Six?<br />\nThe 1969 yearbook can be roughly<br />\ndivided into six parts. Sixty pages<br />\neach carry one photograph of a selected individual in the administration, faculty or student bod37. Six and one-half<br />\npages are devoted to the graduating<br />\nclass. Between the two sections are<br />\nseveral parts devoted to mood shots of<br />\nthe campus, the occupation of Homewood<br />\nHouse last spring, the Lacrosse season<br />\nand the various extracurricular activities on campus.<br />\nThe only written material in the book,<br />\naside from the haphazard identification<br />\nof those photographed, is two short,<br />\nuncredited poems and a statement at<br />\nthe end of the senior sectionwhich reads,<br />\n\"The editor regrets that the senior section does not contain the usual detailed<br />\ninformation for each graduate.\" Rumor<br />\nhas it that Crawford was retaliating against the class for failing to contribute<br />\nits usual $1000 for publication of the<br />\nyearbook.<br /><br />\nbook can be published at all. His plans<br />\ninclude expanding the book to 224 pages<br />\n(versus last year's 152), playing down<br />\nthe use of photographs in favor of a<br />\nmore broadly based commentary about<br />\nthe campus, and giving the students<br />\nmore of \"what they want, rather than<br />\nwhat the editor wants.\" Also, Adams<br />\nclaims, \"the senior section will be expanded by 350%--which will only bring<br />\nus back to where we always were.\"<br />\nAdams is the first editor in several<br />\nyears who is not a photographer and he<br />\nfeels that this may be the factor which<br />\nwill help distinguish this yearbook from<br />\nrecent ones. The past three editions of<br />\nthe yearbook have caused a storm of<br />\ncontroversy over their merits and representation of student life. Adams<br />\nhopes to break this routine by concen-<br /><br />\ntrating heavily on lay-out, social and<br />\npolitical commentary and a tighter organization of material.<br />\n\"The Hullabaloo,\" Adams says, \"is<br />\noperating under the stigma of past years.<br />\nFrom talking to others we think we have<br />\nwhat they want. We hope we don't crunch<br />\nunder the weight of non-subscription.\"<br />\nThe fixed costs of the publication are<br />\napproximately $5,000. If the present<br />\nyearbook gets the same number of subscriptions as last year's 550, Adams<br />\nis confident that he can come out \"in<br />\nthe black.\" If he does not come close<br />\nto that number, the book may not be<br />\npublished at all. \"If the students don't<br />\nwant it and don't buy it, there's no sense<br />\nin continuing the damn book, is there?\"<br />\nAs of Saturday, the Hullabaloo had sold<br />\n350 subscriptions.<br /><br />\n224 Pages<br />\n111111111101\"._<br />\nThe finished product: Joel Crawford's Yearpic by lemm<br />\nbook of 1969.<br /><br />\nJohn Adams, the yearbook's present<br />\neditor, is currently involved in an allout campaign to raise enough subscription money to ensure that this year's<br /><br />\nFellowship<br />\nEach fellowship for single fellows has a total value of $4,540.<br />\nBeginning this June, fellows will<br />\nserve a three-month internship<br />\neither with a department of the<br />\nState Government of Alabama,<br />\nKentucky or Tennessee or with<br />\na federal<br />\nagency in the South,<br />\nsuch as the TVA.

The Psychology Department, under the direction of<br />\ngraduate student Mark Lipsey, and Professor James Deese,<br />\nput together a program that was ambitious, well planned,<br />\nand interesting to the 70-80 students who signed up for it.<br />\nThe Psychology Department's performance speaks well<br />\nfor the Department and the individual faculty merfibers<br />\nand graduate students who participated. It is also encouraging to note that the organization and impetus for the program came from the graduate students. Graduates are<br />\noften accused of not caring what kind of undergraduate<br />\neducation is provided at Hopkins. A few more performances like this would be a welcome contradiction of these<br />\naccusations.<br />\nThe Psychology faculty also deserves praise. The colloquium series featured talks by fourteen members of the<br />\nDepartment, each speaking on a subject within his field of<br />\nexpertise. For the first time in memory, Flopkins came<br />\nclose to fulfilling the promises made in the undergraduate<br />\ncatalogue.<br />\nThe intersession also reminded us of some of Hopkins'<br />\ndisturbing characteristics. The great majority of Hopkins'<br />\n29 departments made no effort to make the three week<br />\nperiod instructive, interesting or in any way valuable for<br />\ngraduates or undergraduates. In November, Dean Swanson<br />\nsent a letter around to all departments, asking what had<br />\nbeen done for the intersession and recommending that<br />\nplans be made to organize programs. Apparently, the letter<br />\nwas widely disregarded.<br />\nCertainly, this should come as no surprise. An uninterrupted three weeks of research must be attractive to<br />\nHopkins professors; the General Assembly voted last<br />\nMarch to charge students no tuition for the mini-semester<br />\nand to pay faculty members no salaries for teaching. But<br />\nthe example of the Psychology Department has shown<br />\nthat intersession could be the most valuable three weeks in<br />\nthe academic year.<br />\nIf salaries must be paid, or tuition charged to involve<br />\nmore students in truly worthwhile programs, we would<br />\nlike to see it done. Whatever need be done to get Hopkins'<br />\ndepartments to show some interest in undergraduate<br />\neducation should be on the top of the University's priority list. Undergraduates reacted well to the programs<br />\nwhich were offered. The classes were lively, informal and<br />\nenjoyable. If the Psychology offerings are regarded as an<br />\nexperiment, the results certainly indicate that more effort<br />\nby other departments is needed.<br /><br />\nThe Tuesday Edition<br />\nThis is the first time in the past several decades that the<br />\nNews-Letter is attempting a twice-weekly publication<br />\nschedule. The last effort ended, ultimately, in failure.<br />\nWe hope not only to make the venture succeed financially, but journalistically and aesthetically as well. Coverage of the campus, the medical institutions and the city<br />\nwill be expanded and we hope to maintain a greater continuity in our reporting. Thank you for your support.<br /><br />\nOlander<br /><br />\nO<br />\nIn the 1950's, C.P. Snow wrote that all intellectual pursuits could be divided into two categories, the<br />\nscientific and the humanistic.<br />\nBiologists, physicists and others who operate<br />\nthrough the scientific method were, he said, so<br />\ntotally isolated from literature, the arts and<br />\nthose that fashioned their lives around these<br />\nthings, that the resulting Two Cultures were<br />\nnever to be reconciled again.<br />\nSeveral years later, Jacque Barzun wrote that<br />\nSnow was wrong. The humanities, Barzun wrote,<br />\nwere merely pathetic imitators of the sciences<br />\nand Snow's Two Cultures were in fact one<br />\nscientific culture. The intellectual focus of the<br />\npast decade has shown us that Barzun was right.<br />\nNowhere is the pervasive influence of science<br />\nmore readily observed than in the university,<br />\nin particular our own.<br />\nThe scientific method, whereby something is<br />\nbroken down, examined and reassembled through<br />\nthe lenses of a particular theory, has engulfed<br />\nthe humanities. Whether it be a novel, an objet<br />\nd' art or a piece of music, it is today assumed<br />\nthat one cannot understand without minute examination of every detail and facet. Observe the<br />\nabsurd lengths to which literary scholars go in<br />\nanalyzing a novel. Faulkner, for one, found this<br />\nextremely amusing. One scholar spent a lifetime examing the use of a particular color in<br />\nthe writings of Joyce. Similarly, a great architect called homes \"machines for living\" with<br />\nslight mention of color and space. Art is presently captivated by geometric constructs of every<br />\nvariety. Euclid would marvel at the retrogression.<br /><br />\nSociological Tool<br />\nThe social studies are now the social sciences<br />\nand examine the mysteries of human groups and<br />\nthe human psyche by means of the quantitative<br />\napproach. Philosophy is highly technical and concerned with semantics. The primary tool of the<br />\nSociologist is the survey. Political Science today<br />\nis meaningless without quantitative analysis and<br />\nPsychologists have turned to the Norway rat<br />\nfor the study of man.<br />\nIf the sciences corrupted the humanities and<br />\n\"soft\" sciences, they did so with the aid and<br />\nencouragement of the universities. Everywhere,<br />\nand painfully obviously at this school, the humanities dwindle in size each year. The reason<br />\nfor this is obvious. Humanits, literary scholars,<br />\nphilosophers, musicians, painters and the like<br />\naren't in vogue; science is.

It would<br />\nrequire, perhaps, the use of laboratory equipment that is not the newest, the subsidization<br />\nof fewer grants for crucial scientific programs.<br />\nThe men, ideas, courses and atmosphere that<br />\nwould result from the strengthening of the arts<br />\nwould benefit all in the university community.<br />\nIn viewing the common cultural products each<br />\nday consumed by the American people, a depressing picture results. Since we cannot adequately<br />\ngauge the influence of the university on society,<br />\nwe can at least decide that there is some.<br />\nIn idolizing the sciences, both the university and<br />\nthe community have created a vacuum in which<br />\nthe Jacquelin Susanns are able to heap their<br />\ntrash on the cultural consumer. The universities<br />\nmust ask themselves to what degree they are<br />\nresponsible for this cultural waste.<br />\nStudents, also, are unwittingly abetting this<br />\ntrend. The call for relevance in a university<br />\ncurriculum is usually directed at the non-humanistic departments. After all, music, literature<br />\nand such studies are not only in dollars and<br />\ncents, the commodities offered by the humanities<br />\nare not readily measured. The apparent lack of<br />\nstudent concern for study in these areas reveals<br />\na deep materialism of a different variety.<br />\nBecause of all these reasons, the artist has<br />\nnever been so completely isolated from the community which studies his work. It was not always<br />\nso.<br />\nThough we live in a culture dominated by<br />\nscience and partly because of the order of<br />\npriorities in the American university, only the<br />\ninstitutions which created this situation can reverse it.

We have presented<br />\nthe coach's side, but Director of Athletics Marshall Turner, hindered by a<br />\nminimal athletic budget, has to look at<br />\nthese proposals differently.<br />\nTurner admits that \"it certainlywould<br />\nbe nice to include a holiday tournament<br />\nfor the basketball team.\" Yet, he feels<br />\nthat the schedule should not be dependent on this every year.<br /><br />\nHe does, however, feel that the present<br />\nschedule should be upped by one or two<br />\ngames. Turner's conservatism stems<br />\nfrom his attempts to maximize the<br />\namount of participation with the minimal<br />\nathletic budget. This unfortunate situation has plagued the athletic center for at<br />\nleast the last ten years; and its origin<br />\nprobably goes much further back in<br />\nHopkins' lore.<br />\nTwo factors further<br />\ncomplicate<br />\nTurner's<br />\nseemingly insurmountable<br />\ntask. The first is the effect inflation<br />\nhas, straining an already heavily taxed<br />\nbudget. The second is the fact that<br />\nscheduling, being as complicated as it is<br />\nwith games having to be scheduled in<br />\nTurner's words \"two, sometimes three<br />\nyears in advance\" does not coincide<br />\nwith budget allottments for the following<br /><br />\nWrestlers Are Tough,<br />\nFace Tough Opposition<br />\nBy ED BRETHAUER<br />\nThe Hopkins' Varsity Wrestling Team<br />\nhas competed in five matches so far<br />\nthis season, and has won three of those,<br />\nhaving beaten Washington College (2413), Loyola (26-13), and Dickinson (2318).<br />\nAs one can see from these scores,<br />\nHopkins is 2-0 in the Mason-Dixon<br />\nConference so far, with two tough matches coming up against Western Maryland and Towson State. Victories in<br />\nthese two matches would definitely make<br />\nup for losses to Delaware (40-0) and<br />\nLebanon Valley (30-8).<br />\nThe team has been good despite the<br />\nlatter scores, as can be witnessed in<br />\nthe records of several individuals. Nick<br />\nPratt has won three matches all by<br />\npins, of which the most notable was<br />\nhis victory over Frank Filippi of Washington College in the 190 LB. class.<br />\nCarl Betta, in a lower weight class,<br />\nhas won two of his matches, while Jeff<br />\nTurshen has also done an outstanding<br />\njob for the team.<br /><br />\nJack Haneman has done a fine job<br />\nas captain of the team, winning some<br />\nvery close matches, such as his 3-2<br />\ndecision over Steve Golding of WashThe most improved<br />\nington College.<br />\nwrestler so far this season, though,<br />\nwould have to be Bob Sanborn, who<br />\nwas credited with a fall against Loyola,<br />\nand a 14-3 decision over Kneeland of<br />\nDickinson.<br />\nThe big problem for the varsity this<br />\nseason has been the schedule itself,<br />\nwhich was set up before the academic<br />\nyear was reorganized. Thus, the varsity had a lot of its wrestlers taken<br />\naway during the exam period, forcing<br />\nthe team to forfeit a great deal of<br />\nmatches. For example, in the Lebanon<br />\nValley meet, Hopkins gave up fifteen<br />\npoints immediately by forfeiting the<br />\n118,126, and Heavyweight matches. The<br />\nsituation did not get better directly<br />\nafter the exam period, though, because<br />\nthose boys who were forced to leave<br />\nthe team during this period did not return in January.<br /><br />\nschool year which are made in the<br />\nSpring and are worked out in the preceeding winter.<br />\nTherefore, Turner is forced to make<br />\ncommitments before he knows what his<br />\nbudget will be. He is reluctant to make<br />\nfurther commitments on the grounds that<br />\nthere is no assurance that Dean Kimball<br />\nwould approve budgetary requests for<br />\nsuch events as a Christmas tournament.<br />\nAdmittedly, in past year's briefings about<br />\nthe budget that would eventually be submitted Turner has been discouraged from<br />\nincluding such a category. He is also<br />\nreluctant, because the inclusion of such<br />\na tournament might result in having to<br />\ncut down some other aspect of the athletic program - a move which he vehemently resists.<br />\nTurner feels that such a sludge fund,<br />\nIf you want to call it that, should not be<br />\nalloted for one specific sport. If such<br />\na fund were to come into existence, one<br />\nyear it might go to the basketball team,<br />\nthe next the swimming team,thenwrestling squad, and maybe a Southern trip<br />\nfor the golf or tennis team, etc. Some<br />\nlogical rotation would be set up to give<br />\nall the sports a fair share of the pie.<br />\nIn upcoming meetings of the Athletic<br />\nCommittee, the topic of post season<br />\nplay will be taken up. We sincerely<br />\nhope that their discussions will include<br />\nsome serious talk of this whole matter<br />\nof a contingency fund and Hopkins'sponsored tournaments.<br />\nSo where do these money worries lead<br />\n'us? Right back to the question of a city<br />\ntournament and a Christmas tourney for<br />\nthe basketball team.When asked about the<br />\ncity tournament, Turner mentioned that<br />\ninformal inquiries with Loyola were met<br />\nby a less than enthusiastic response.<br />\nLoyola, which has played in the Civic<br />\nCenter several times, has been the victim of sports promoters and is unwilling to get involved unless it be through<br />\n\"institutional impetus\". Turner insists<br />\nthat Hopkins will not take the initiative<br />\nsince he does not have the time to devote<br />\nto the necessary legwork.<br />\nHowever, he leaves the door openwhen<br />\nhe says that Hopkins would not be totally<br /><br />\nDROP OUT?

He was<br />\nless than enthusiastic about Hopkins'<br />\ninterest if the initiative were to come<br />\nfrom Baltimore University.<br />\nAlthough the formal excuse is that B.U.<br />\nis not fully accredited, an underlying<br />\nreason is that in the past B.U. has been<br />\nguilty of \"cutting corners\". When asked<br />\nto explain, Turner sighted several infractions such as playing students under.<br />\n\"assumed names\", the playing of night<br />\nschool students, and the almost nonexistent academic requirements of the<br />\ninstitution. Turner points out that this<br />\nsituation has changed in the past few<br />\nyears, but still remained wary of a<br />\ntournament bid from this direction.<br />\nOn the other side of a rather gloomy<br />\npicture, Turner notes \"that it is conceivable that Hopkins might join with<br />\nLoyola in bringing in two teams to play<br />\non the last weekend before Christmas,\"<br />\nbut by Turner's own estimates this is<br />\nat least two years away. Nothing definite<br />\nhas been set up. Problems in paying for<br />\ntransportation and room and board have<br />\nalso kept Hopkins from participating in<br />\nother holiday tournaments. Feelers had<br />\nbeen received from Washington and Lee<br />\nin Virginia, and from Sacred Heart<br />\nUniversity in Bridgeport, Conn. Western<br />\nMaryland is participating in the Washington and Lee affair this year, and both<br />\nSwarthmore and Kickinson are playing<br />\nin the Bridgeport tourney. Turner cites<br />\nthat the Swarthmore players would have<br />\nto pay for their own meals on 4 days<br />\nout of their vacation time while practicing at the Garnet campus.<br />\nIn closing Turner viewed program<br />\nadditions as a worthwile thing, but, before one could start financing new projects, money has to be available to<br />\nfinance the old program.<br />\nTurner has a valid point which we<br />\nunderstand, even if we don't always<br />\nagree with him. At any rate, it is sobering to hear from the other side every<br />\nonce in a while. The whole University,<br />\nnot just the Athletic Center, is in dire<br />\nfinancial straits.

In the<br />\nwords of Ellery Woodworth, Hopkins is<br />\n\"gearing up\" for the biggest capital<br />\ncampaign in its history.<br />\nWoodworth is Hopkins' Vice-President<br />\nfor Development and his office in Homewood House is the headquarters for the<br />\ndevelopment campaign. His responsibility is \"to organize the development<br />\npossibilities here and bring to Hopkins<br />\nthe experienced staff to plan and prosecute the campaign successfully.\"<br /><br />\nthough the federal government is becoming less and less inclined to pick<br />\nup the tab. The foundations, which had .<br />\npreviously contributed a great deal toward the support of programs at Hopkins,<br />\nwere hit hard by the recent tax reform<br />\nbill. Increasingly, support for private<br />\nhigher education will have to come<br />\nfrom private sources. It is these sources which the coming campaign hopes<br />\nto reach, and according to Woodworth,<br />\nthe stakes are high. \"The whole future<br />\nof this institution depends on our setting<br />\na goal and meeting it,\" he said.<br />\nThe setting of that goal is the affair<br />\nof President Gordon and the Board of<br />\nTrustees. At present, there is no word<br />\non what the goal will be. Woodworth<br />\nstated that the goal may be \"substantially in excess of $100 million.\" He<br />\nemphasized that this was his personal<br />\nestimate.<br /><br />\nMoney Trouble<br />\nThe major development program will<br />\ninvolve all divisions of the University<br />\nand the Hospital. Central to the campaign is the notion that it will end in<br />\n1976, Hopkins' centennial year. Woodworth, who came to Hopkins seven monthis ago, estimates that the total development program now being planned may<br />\ncontinue considerably past the centennial<br />\nmark. He visualizes a ten-year program<br />\nof development beginning with a capital<br />\ncampaign lasting approximately five<br />\nyears. At present it appears that the<br />\ncampaign will begin in 1971.<br /><br />\nWilliam Bevan on what the University's<br />\nneeds will be in the coming years. Bevan<br />\nwill have to weigh and sift all plans,<br />\nrequests and programs to see which qualify for a place in the list of the University's \"prime needs.\"<br />\nAll of the information from Bevan's<br />\noffice and from John Price Jones Company will go to President Gordon and<br />\nthe Board of Trustees, who will then<br />\ndetermine the goal of the funds campaign.<br />\nOnce the goal is determined, Woodworth and the Development staff will<br />\nattempt to figure what type of contributions are needed. Before the campaign<br />\nis announced to the public, \"special<br />\ngift solicitation\" will begin. This entails approaching wealthy potential contributors and giving them \"first shot\"<br />\nat the lists of what is needed.<br /><br />\nSpecial Gifts<br />\nPrime Needs<br />\nThe goal will be determined by two<br />\nmajor factors. The first is the outcome<br />\nof a study now being conducted by John<br />\nPrice Jones Comapny, of New York.<br />\nThe firm has had much experience in<br />\nthe field of fund-raising for colleges<br />\nand universities. It is presently attempting to determine the amounts of money<br />\nwhich Hopkins might raise and from<br />\nwhat sources. Its report should be presented to Hopkins around March 1, and<br />\ncontain the firm's recommendatons on<br />\na \"feasible\" fund raising goal.<br />\nThe second major factor in determining the goal of the drive will be<br />\nthe report of the deans, faculty and<br /><br />\nBut the development program and<br />\ncapital campaign is hardly due delay in<br />\nthe to a casual approach. Hopkins is<br />\nin trouble for money and it looks as<br /><br />\nSpecial gifts are generally the largest<br />\nof the contributions and serve to make<br />\nup a large percentage of the final campaign intake.<br />\nOnce the campaign is made public, all<br />\npotential contributors will receive a copy<br />\nof the \"case statement.\" This is a<br />\ndocument describing the campaign, Hopkins and future needs of the university.<br />\nThe first prose section is to be followed<br />\nby a rather detailed list of the needs<br />\nof Hopkins and the possible contributions<br />\nto be made; the list can be completed<br />\nonly. after the \"prime needs\" of the<br />\nUniversity have been decided upon.<br />\nThe case statement will give the<br /><br />\n'<br />\nc<br />\nt<br /><br />\n\\--;\u2022\u2022<br />\n:<br /><br />\nENGINEERS-SCIENTISTS-MATHEMATICIANS<br /><br /><br />\n&lt;<br />\n2<br />\n:<br /><br />\n&lt;<br /><br />\n&lt;<br />\n2<br />\n:<br /><br />\nLINK YOUR COUNTRY'S FUTURE<br />\nWITH YOUR OWN<br /><br />\nWINTER PENGUINS<br />\n...NEW<br />\nCAMPUS<br /><br />\n3'<br /><br /><br /><br />\nGREENBELT, MD.<br /><br />\nShopping List<br />\nFeingold is presently working on a.<br />\ndraft of the first section of the statement. Woodworth hired Feingold for the<br />\nDevelopment Staff three months ago.Before the end of next year, the staff will<br />\nexpand from its present size of fifteen<br />\nprofessionals to a total of thirty. The<br />\nnumber of professionals does not include clerical help or volunteers.<br />\nOne of the most important considerations in a campaign such as this is<br />\nthe \"kind\" of contributions received.<br />\nWoodworth and Feingold emphasized that<br />\nlarge private contributions are the best<br />\nkind to receive. The industrial andfoundation contributions are made only for<br />\nvery specific purposes and only after<br />\ndetailed prospecti and proposals are<br />\nsubmitted. Private donations, on the<br />\nother hand, are often made without<br />\nrestrictions as to the use of the funds.<br />\nThe campaign will concentrate on these<br />\nprivate contributions instead of foundation grants which have provided a<br />\nlarge percentage of program revenue in<br />\nthe past.<br /><br />\nTV<br />\n\\MAA MMWMMM6<br />\n()<br />\nf)0<br /><br />\nGROW WITH THE SPACE AGE AT<br /><br />\nGODDARD<br />\nSPACE<br />\nFLIGHT<br />\nCENTER<br /><br />\n\"price\" of a building, a faculty chair,<br />\na continuing scholarship, etc. The con-:<br />\n.tributor then knows that if he wants a<br />\nbuilding in his name, it will cost him<br />\n$10 million. According to Ed Feingold,<br />\nDirector of Public Affairs for the Campaign, people pick what they want to<br />\ncontribute to and specify exactly what<br />\ntheir contributions may be used for.<br />\n\"Of course,\" added Feingold,. \"if a<br />\ncontributor only comes up with $8.5<br />\nmillion, we'll find the rest.\"<br /><br />\n&lt;<br />\n:<br />\n2<br /><br />\nISRAEL AND THE ARABS.
