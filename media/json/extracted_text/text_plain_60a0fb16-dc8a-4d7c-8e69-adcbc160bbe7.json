Baseball is an<br />\n<br />\nexcellent game to play and, while .lacking the speed of lacrosse, is an<br />\ninteresting sport to watch, particularly if the spectators are conversant<br />\nwith the intricacies of the game. The sports writers of the country,<br />\nin a recent poll, praised baseball as the game most fitted for college<br />\nmen. They claimed that the game is fine exercise for all the muscles<br />\nof the body and that it does not exert the tremendous physical and<br />\nnervous strain upon the player that lacrosse and football do.<br />\nNevertheless, we feel that the athletic authorities will never consent<br />\nto a baseball team at Hopkins. From their point of view, they are<br />\nright, for baseball is a game that requires a great deal of financial outlay without drawing large enough crowds to compensate for the expense involved.. Furthermore, the undergraduate body at Hopkins is<br />\ntoo small to furnish enough material for both good lacrosse and baseball teams. Even if there were enough material, the lure of the diamond would coax many men from the crease just as track now claims<br />\nmen who are potential lacrosse stars. And the athletic authorities will<br />\ndo nothing to dim the wonderful reputation which Hopkins has now<br />\nin lacrosse.<br />\nSo the baseball enthusiasts must resign themselves to failure, worthy<br />\nas their cause is. It is a great pity that our athletic appropriation is<br />\n, . not large enough to increase the variety of teams representing Hopkins.<br />\n<br />\nMORE CONGRATULATIONS<br />\nHopkins students were given a big boost toward success<br />\nSIXTEEN<br />\nin their chosen profession when they were admitted to the Medical<br />\nSchool last week. These students can claim without fear of contradiction that their college years have been successful.<br />\nThe start in life which the Hopkins Medical School gives its graduates is equalled by no other educational institution in the country. It<br />\nsurpasses its nearest rival, the Harvard School of Law, in the universal<br />\nesteem with which it endows its graduates. A man is not made simply<br />\nbecause he has received his M. D. from Hopkins, but, other things<br />\nbeing equal, he has a great advantage over his fellows at the start.<br />\nParticularly so if he intends to practice in Baltimore or the vicinity.<br />\nThe reputation of the Medical School works only one evil; it<br />\novershadows the other departments of the University. Because the<br />\nMedical School is so well known, laymen throughout the country believe that all Hopkins men are students of medicine or are, at least,<br />\npursuing a pre-medical course.

Baseball is an<br /><br />\nexcellent game to play and, while .lacking the speed of lacrosse, is an<br />\ninteresting sport to watch, particularly if the spectators are conversant<br />\nwith the intricacies of the game. The sports writers of the country,<br />\nin a recent poll, praised baseball as the game most fitted for college<br />\nmen. They claimed that the game is fine exercise for all the muscles<br />\nof the body and that it does not exert the tremendous physical and<br />\nnervous strain upon the player that lacrosse and football do.<br />\nNevertheless, we feel that the athletic authorities will never consent<br />\nto a baseball team at Hopkins. From their point of view, they are<br />\nright, for baseball is a game that requires a great deal of financial outlay without drawing large enough crowds to compensate for the expense involved.. Furthermore, the undergraduate body at Hopkins is<br />\ntoo small to furnish enough material for both good lacrosse and baseball teams. Even if there were enough material, the lure of the diamond would coax many men from the crease just as track now claims<br />\nmen who are potential lacrosse stars. And the athletic authorities will<br />\ndo nothing to dim the wonderful reputation which Hopkins has now<br />\nin lacrosse.<br />\nSo the baseball enthusiasts must resign themselves to failure, worthy<br />\nas their cause is.

It<br />\nsurpasses its nearest rival, the Harvard School of Law, in the universal<br />\nesteem with which it endows its graduates. A man is not made simply<br />\nbecause he has received his M. D. from Hopkins, but, other things<br />\nbeing equal, he has a great advantage over his fellows at the start.<br />\nParticularly so if he intends to practice in Baltimore or the vicinity.<br />\nThe reputation of the Medical School works only one evil; it<br />\novershadows the other departments of the University. Because the<br />\nMedical School is so well known, laymen throughout the country believe that all Hopkins men are students of medicine or are, at least,<br />\npursuing a pre-medical course. However, all Hopkins men puff with<br />\npride at the mention of the Medical School even though they must<br />\nconstantly explain that there really are other departments to the University.<br />\nOnce more we congratulate the students who have been admitted<br />\nto the Medical School with the wish that they take full advantage of<br />\nthe opportunity offered them.<br /><br />\nThe California Daily Bruin carries an interesting clipping concerning a novelty at the University of<br />\nNevada: \"Not since the days of<br />\nforty-niners in Nevada has there<br />\nbeen such a revival of the red-blooded, old-fashioned pastime of growing whiskers as that to be witnessed<br />\non the chins of the students of the<br />\nState University here.
