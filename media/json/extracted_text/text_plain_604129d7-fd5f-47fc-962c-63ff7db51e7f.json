One area concerns<br />\nCouncil representatives who have<br />\nthe attitude that, having once<br />\nbeen elected by 'popularity contest' to the Council, they no longer feel obligated to devote an<br />\nadequate amount of time and<br />\nenergy to the Council.<br />\nThis attitude is dissolving as<br />\nthe Council takes on more work.<br />\nIt should also be pointed out that<br />\nas the committee chairmen aslime more responsibility, and as<br />\n<br />\neach Council member shows more<br />\ninitiative, the better the status<br />\nof the Council. (To this end,<br />\nFreshmen Council members have<br />\nassigned responsibilities.)<br />\nThe second, and most important, area of concern is the Council's lack of support from the<br />\nstudents whom they are supposed<br />\nto represent, and from the faculty and Administration as well.<br />\nAlthough valid, this point too<br />\nlong has been depicted as a general Hopkins' trait to be argued<br />\nhere. Nevertheless, if the Student<br />\nCouncil is to act as a responsible,<br />\nrepresentative body, it must have<br />\na greater amount of support from<br />\nthe campus.<br />\nIn my estimation, the Student<br />\nCouncil has at least taken those<br />\npreliminary steps to deserve increased support. In the weeks to<br />\ncome, besides the present activities of the Council, I hope to investigate the advising system and<br />\nthe orientation program given to<br />\nfreshmen.<br />\nIntermediary Position<br />\nThe Council has made greater<br />\nefforts to serve as an intermediary between Administration, faculty, and students. Letters and<br />\n<br />\nspecial meetings between Council<br />\nrepresentatives and administrative and faculty members have<br />\nserved to represent student opinion and provide a liason between<br />\nthe undergraduate body and the<br />\nDirector of Student Activities, Dr.<br />\nW. Kelso Morrill; the President's<br />\nOffice; the Public Relations Office; the Admissions Office; the<br />\nRegistrar; the Plant Manager's<br />\nOffice; and Dean Shaffer.<br />\nThe Executive Committee has<br />\nmet twice this semester to discuss general Council policy, and<br />\nunder the direction of the Vice<br />\nPresident, Penn Lupovich, to direct comlnittee action with the<br />\nchairman of each permanent<br />\ncommittee of the Council.<br />\nEfficient Committees<br />\nThe Elections Committee under<br />\nthe Chairmanship of Tom Gibson has done a very efficient job<br />\nin conducting the election procedure for Freshman Officers and<br />\nfor the Referendum on the revised Student Council Constitution. (In the previous two elections, the Council was faced with<br />\ncontested results and, hence, had<br />\nto run re-elections.)<br />\nT h e Assembly Committee<br />\nboasts a very active program.<br />\n<br />\nBob Baensch, Chairman, has<br />\nworked hard to conduct the five<br />\nassemblies which have already<br />\nbeen presented. They are: (1) An<br />\nAddress by President Milton S.<br />\nEisenhower, (2) The film, \"Our<br />\nMister Sun,\" (3) An Address by<br />\nRichard Niebuhr co-sponsored<br />\nwith the Y.M.C.A. and the Council of Religious Groups, (4) The<br />\nAnnual Christmas Assembly, and<br />\n(5) The Hungarian Relief Rally,<br />\nwhich was also supported by<br />\nother campus organizations.<br />\nOne of the most active committees this year has been the<br />\nPublic Relations Committee. Paul<br />\nGordon, the original Chairman,<br />\nhas worked in close cooperation<br />\nwith the Admissions office in<br />\nconducting a series of 'Introduction to College Life' programs<br />\nwith many local high schools.<br />\nThis committee has helped conduct the various tours of the<br />\nHopkins campus for visitors. .<br />\nThe Council has also acted as<br />\nhost during the President's teas,<br />\nwhere it introduced faculty<br />\nguests to the receiving lines.<br />\nTony Salem is the present chairman of the Committee.<br />\nLupovitch Lauded<br />\nOne of the biggest jobs of this<br />\nyear's Council was done by Penn<br />\nLupovitch who headed the Constitution Committee. After three<br />\nyears of effort the Council fin-<br />\n<br />\nally finished the revision of its<br />\nconstitution and after much publicity, special meetings, and letters, placed it before the student<br />\nbody. The Referendum was passed by a vote of 517 to 101.<br />\nThe Council has taken under<br />\nconcerned consideration the badly neglected area of student conduct and responsibility. A permanent Gentleman's Code Committee was established with Iry<br />\nSekulow as chairman. This Committee, using the Gentleman's<br />\nCode as a basic premise, introduced to the Council a series of<br />\nresolutions, and then, with a<br />\nspecial meeting of activity 'heads'<br />\nand with a careful explanation in<br />\nthe News-Letter, attempted to<br />\ncall attention- to.the student body<br />\nof those areas where students and<br />\nstudent organizations were not<br />\nassuming sufficient responsibility.<br />\nIn dealing with the SAC, the<br />\nCouncil passed a rule and set up<br />\na procedure giving the Student<br />\nCouncil the right to approve any<br />\naction taken by the SAC. In an<br />\neffort to aid the SAC and a group<br />\nof students known as the Central Publicity Office (CPO), the<br />\nCouncil has formed a temporary<br />\nCentral Publicity Committee to<br />\ngive official recognition to these<br />\nstudents until they become an<br />\nestablished organization.<br />\n<br />\nE.E.'s, M.E.'s, A.E.'s, Math,Physics & Chemistry Majors:<br />\n<br />\n$45.00\u2014Harris Tweed Sport Coats<br />\n<br />\nDevelop & Extend<br />\nYour Capabilities<br />\nAPL Where a Unique Combination of Industrial<br />\nand Academic Approaches is Applied to R & D Problems<br />\n<br />\n$50.00\u2014Harris Tweed Top Coats ;tow $39.50<br />\n$60.00\u2014Ivy<br />\n<br />\nnow $43.50<br />\n<br />\nSuifs<br />\n<br />\n$15.00\u2014Wool Flannel Ivy Slacks<br />\n<br />\nrgow $10.95<br />\n<br />\nM.

One area concerns<br />\nCouncil representatives who have<br />\nthe attitude that, having once<br />\nbeen elected by 'popularity contest' to the Council, they no longer feel obligated to devote an<br />\nadequate amount of time and<br />\nenergy to the Council.<br />\nThis attitude is dissolving as<br />\nthe Council takes on more work.<br />\nIt should also be pointed out that<br />\nas the committee chairmen aslime more responsibility, and as<br /><br />\neach Council member shows more<br />\ninitiative, the better the status<br />\nof the Council. (To this end,<br />\nFreshmen Council members have<br />\nassigned responsibilities.)<br />\nThe second, and most important, area of concern is the Council's lack of support from the<br />\nstudents whom they are supposed<br />\nto represent, and from the faculty and Administration as well.<br />\nAlthough valid, this point too<br />\nlong has been depicted as a general Hopkins' trait to be argued<br />\nhere. Nevertheless, if the Student<br />\nCouncil is to act as a responsible,<br />\nrepresentative body, it must have<br />\na greater amount of support from<br />\nthe campus.<br />\nIn my estimation, the Student<br />\nCouncil has at least taken those<br />\npreliminary steps to deserve increased support. In the weeks to<br />\ncome, besides the present activities of the Council, I hope to investigate the advising system and<br />\nthe orientation program given to<br />\nfreshmen.<br />\nIntermediary Position<br />\nThe Council has made greater<br />\nefforts to serve as an intermediary between Administration, faculty, and students. Letters and<br /><br />\nspecial meetings between Council<br />\nrepresentatives and administrative and faculty members have<br />\nserved to represent student opinion and provide a liason between<br />\nthe undergraduate body and the<br />\nDirector of Student Activities, Dr.<br />\nW. Kelso Morrill; the President's<br />\nOffice; the Public Relations Office; the Admissions Office; the<br />\nRegistrar; the Plant Manager's<br />\nOffice; and Dean Shaffer.<br />\nThe Executive Committee has<br />\nmet twice this semester to discuss general Council policy, and<br />\nunder the direction of the Vice<br />\nPresident, Penn Lupovich, to direct comlnittee action with the<br />\nchairman of each permanent<br />\ncommittee of the Council.<br />\nEfficient Committees<br />\nThe Elections Committee under<br />\nthe Chairmanship of Tom Gibson has done a very efficient job<br />\nin conducting the election procedure for Freshman Officers and<br />\nfor the Referendum on the revised Student Council Constitution. (In the previous two elections, the Council was faced with<br />\ncontested results and, hence, had<br />\nto run re-elections.)<br />\nT h e Assembly Committee<br />\nboasts a very active program.<br /><br />\nBob Baensch, Chairman, has<br />\nworked hard to conduct the five<br />\nassemblies which have already<br />\nbeen presented. They are: (1) An<br />\nAddress by President Milton S.<br />\nEisenhower, (2) The film, \"Our<br />\nMister Sun,\" (3) An Address by<br />\nRichard Niebuhr co-sponsored<br />\nwith the Y.M.C.A. and the Council of Religious Groups, (4) The<br />\nAnnual Christmas Assembly, and<br />\n(5) The Hungarian Relief Rally,<br />\nwhich was also supported by<br />\nother campus organizations.<br />\nOne of the most active committees this year has been the<br />\nPublic Relations Committee. Paul<br />\nGordon, the original Chairman,<br />\nhas worked in close cooperation<br />\nwith the Admissions office in<br />\nconducting a series of 'Introduction to College Life' programs<br />\nwith many local high schools.<br />\nThis committee has helped conduct the various tours of the<br />\nHopkins campus for visitors. .<br />\nThe Council has also acted as<br />\nhost during the President's teas,<br />\nwhere it introduced faculty<br />\nguests to the receiving lines.<br />\nTony Salem is the present chairman of the Committee.<br />\nLupovitch Lauded<br />\nOne of the biggest jobs of this<br />\nyear's Council was done by Penn<br />\nLupovitch who headed the Constitution Committee. After three<br />\nyears of effort the Council fin-<br /><br />\nally finished the revision of its<br />\nconstitution and after much publicity, special meetings, and letters, placed it before the student<br />\nbody. The Referendum was passed by a vote of 517 to 101.<br />\nThe Council has taken under<br />\nconcerned consideration the badly neglected area of student conduct and responsibility. A permanent Gentleman's Code Committee was established with Iry<br />\nSekulow as chairman. This Committee, using the Gentleman's<br />\nCode as a basic premise, introduced to the Council a series of<br />\nresolutions, and then, with a<br />\nspecial meeting of activity 'heads'<br />\nand with a careful explanation in<br />\nthe News-Letter, attempted to<br />\ncall attention- to.the student body<br />\nof those areas where students and<br />\nstudent organizations were not<br />\nassuming sufficient responsibility.<br />\nIn dealing with the SAC, the<br />\nCouncil passed a rule and set up<br />\na procedure giving the Student<br />\nCouncil the right to approve any<br />\naction taken by the SAC. In an<br />\neffort to aid the SAC and a group<br />\nof students known as the Central Publicity Office (CPO), the<br />\nCouncil has formed a temporary<br />\nCentral Publicity Committee to<br />\ngive official recognition to these<br />\nstudents until they become an<br />\nestablished organization.<br /><br />\nE.E.'s, M.E.'s, A.E.'s, Math,Physics &amp; Chemistry Majors:<br /><br />\n$45.00\u2014Harris Tweed Sport Coats<br /><br />\nDevelop &amp; Extend<br />\nYour Capabilities<br />\nAPL Where a Unique Combination of Industrial<br />\nand Academic Approaches is Applied to R &amp; D Problems<br /><br />\n$50.00\u2014Harris Tweed Top Coats ;tow $39.50<br />\n$60.00\u2014Ivy<br /><br />\nnow $43.50<br /><br />\nSuifs<br /><br />\n$15.00\u2014Wool Flannel Ivy Slacks<br /><br />\nrgow $10.95<br /><br />\nM.
