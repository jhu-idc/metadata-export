M. C. A. by Large Score.<br />\n<br />\nAt the meeting of the Board of<br />\nTrustees last Tuesday, President<br />\nDaniel Willard of the Baltimore<br />\nand Ohio Railroad was unanimously elected a trustee of the University. Mr. Willard succeeds Dr.<br />\nWilliam H. Buckler the noted archaeologist who, at one time, was<br />\nconsidered the probable next president of the University.<br />\nDr. Buckler resigned from the<br />\nBoard two years ago, when he went<br />\nabroad to carry on archaeological<br />\ninvestigation in Asia.<br />\nOwing to the fact that he has<br />\nkept in constant touch with Hopkins matters, and although absent,<br />\nhas done much for the advancement<br />\nof the University, the place had not<br />\nbeen filled.<br />\nA committee, consisting of Dr.<br />\nWilliam H. Welch, chairman of<br />\nthe Board of Administration; R.<br />\nBrent Keyser, chairman of the<br />\nBoard of Trustees, and B. Howell<br />\nGriswold, Jr., called on Mr. Willard<br />\nseveral weeks ago and urged him<br />\nto accept the Hopkins trusteeship.<br />\nAs Mr. Willard wrote his letter of<br />\nacceptance last week, the meeting<br />\nof the trustees was'merely in the<br />\nnature of a formal ratification of<br />\nhis acceptance.<br />\nMr.. Keyser said that Mr. Willard's acceptance was a source of<br />\ngreat gratification to him and the<br />\nother members of the Board. He<br />\nregards Mr. Willard as a strong<br />\nacquisition.<br />\nDean Griffin also expressed this<br />\ngratification at the selection of such<br />\na talented executive as Mr. Willard for the position of trustee of<br />\nthe University.<br />\n\u2022<br />\nThe new trustee is a man of the<br />\nhighest intellectual and executive<br />\nabilities. He is a self-made man<br />\nin the highest sense of the word,<br />\nhaving risen to his present high<br />\nposition from the humble position<br />\nof section foreman. He has always<br />\nbeen a close personal friend of Dr.<br />\n\\Velch and Mr. Keyser, and the<br />\nconsequent close touch with the<br />\naims and ideals of the University<br />\nhas aroused in him a very keen interest in its future. Mr. Willard,<br />\nthough a comparatively young railroad president, was very recently<br />\nchosen by his colleagues to represent all the railroad systems of the<br />\nEast at the recent rate, hearings before the Interstate Commerce Commission.<br />\n<br />\nThe University Musical Clubs<br />\nmade a trip to Port Deposit last<br />\nSaturday, and gave a concert there<br />\nin Memorial Hall of the Tome<br />\nSchool. The following men made<br />\nthe trip: Messrs. White, Hayes,<br />\nEiseman, Bowden, Scovell, Spieker,<br />\nSupplee, Snyder, Rutledge, Weber,<br />\nMelamet, Stollenwerck, Primrose,<br />\nHall, Weech, Lynch, Smith, Geissel,<br />\nHowell, Doub, Gailey, Baker, Biser,<br />\nReier, Lauchheimer, Owens, Coblentz, Bacchus, Gillet, Fulton and<br />\nE. L. R. Smith. Leaving Baltimore<br />\nabout one o'clock, the musicians arrived at Tome in time to play a very<br />\namateurish basketball game with<br />\nthe Tome team. Our men had no<br />\npractice and of course were badly<br />\nbeaten. The concert at night was<br />\ngiven in the Memorial Hall. There<br />\nwere about 3oo in the audience.<br />\nmostly boys, with some members of<br />\nthe faculty and a few ladies. The<br />\naudience was, no doubt, the most<br />\nappreciative one that our men have<br />\never played to. It did one good<br />\nto hear them applaud; it went and<br />\ncame straight from the heart. It<br />\nseemed to put new life into our<br />\nmen and they gave the best concert<br />\nof this season, in spite of their depleted numbers. The quartet drew<br />\nforth thunderous applause, and<br />\n\"Jack and Gill\" walked away with<br />\ntheir usual honors. In spite of the<br />\nbad weather, the musicians all declared they had had a \"large\" time,<br />\nnot excluding the eats.<br />\nThe Tome concert has given the<br />\nClubs excellent practice for the<br />\nMcCoy Hall concert. The weak<br />\npoints showed up, and the fine<br />\npoints have begun to peer forth.<br />\nAll that remains is for the students<br />\nto get busy with the tickets and provide just as large an audience on<br />\nFebruary 6.<br />\nOn the seventh a very limited<br />\nnumber of the musicians will make<br />\na trip to Frederick, where they will<br />\ngive a concert in the auditorium of<br />\nTiood College.<br />\n<br />\nDispatches from Washington were<br />\nsent over the country yesterday telling of the rumor that President<br />\nWilson was considering Dr. Jacob<br />\nH. Hollander, head of the economic<br />\ndepartment, for membership on the<br />\nnew Federal Reserve Board. Senator Hollis, of New Hampshire, it<br />\nwas said, is believed to be Dr. Hollander's sponsor, and friends of the<br />\nprofessor attach more credence to<br />\nthe dispatches because he and the<br />\nPresident have known each other<br />\nas university professors.<br />\nIt is remembered that Dr. Hollander has done excellent service<br />\nfor the country before in handling<br />\nthe finances of Santo Domingo;<br />\nsuggesting government reforms for<br />\nCuba, and in organizing the treasury of Porto Rico when the island<br />\nwas taken over by the United States<br />\nafter the Spanish. war.<br />\nThe rumor that he is now slated<br />\nfor membership on the Reserve<br />\nBoard is based on a speech delivered before the Bankers' Association of Washington on Saturday<br />\nnight. Senator Hollis said in his<br />\nspeech that the senate had agreed<br />\nnot to suggest names for the Board<br />\nto the President, but that he had<br />\nviolated the compact by suggesting<br />\none name. He further said:<br />\n\"He is a Republican, too; I consider him one of the greatest financial experts in the world. One of<br />\nthe remarkable things he did was to<br />\nwrite an article in which he pointed<br />\nout the faults of the old banking<br />\nand currency system and predicted<br />\nthat a nation-wide money panic<br />\nwould result. Well, the panic came.<br />\nIt seemed to me that a man so<br />\nthoroughly familiar with currency<br />\nproblems would be a good man to<br />\nhave on that Board.\"<br />\nSenator Hollis, from the point of<br />\nview of university men, is quite correct in his praise of Dr. Hollander,<br />\nbut he is perhaps mistaken in calling the professor a Republican.<br />\n(Continued on page 5, col. 2)<br />\n<br />\nBy defeating the team of the Baltimore Y. M. C. A. to the tune of<br />\n74 to 25 in the initial meet of the<br />\nseason last Saturday night, in which<br />\nfour cage records were smashed,<br />\nthe track men made a beginning<br />\nthat prophesies a bright season for<br />\nthis year. The Y. M. C. A. men<br />\nput up a good fight throughout, but.<br />\nin most cases were no match for the<br />\ncollegians. The Association's star<br />\nmiler, J. B. (Spike) Brown, who<br />\nestablished the former cage record<br />\nlast year, was able to clip off a<br />\nsecond from his old time, completing his distance in four minutes<br />\nfifty-eight seconds.<br />\nThe most interesting event was<br />\nthe 440-yard dash, which Lloyd<br />\n(J. H. U.) won in record time. The<br />\nprevious record established by former Capt. Herbert Catlin was 583'5<br />\nseconds, but Lloyd covered the distance in a beautiful race in 58 flat.<br />\nGroover(J. H. U.) finished second,<br />\nnot far behind the winner, and<br />\nEveret (Y. M. C. A.) followed<br />\nclosely. The 88o-yard run was also<br />\na pretty race, won by Uhler(J. H.<br />\nU.) in the exceedingly good time<br />\nseconds.<br />\nof 2 minutes<br />\nHopkins was victOrious in both<br />\nthe relay events, breaking the cage<br />\nrecords in both. The 88o-yard relay, in which four men run each<br />\ntwo laps around the cage, was done<br />\n5 seconds, taking off<br />\nin I minute 387<br />\nfour-fifths of a second from the old<br />\nrecord. Straus, Thompson, Wells<br />\nand Sutton, three of whom are<br />\nfreshmen, made up this team for<br />\nHopkins. In the r,600-yard relay<br />\n375 seconds were clipped off the<br />\nformer time, Wagner, Binford,<br />\nGroover and Lloyd covering the<br />\ndistance in 3 minutes 2975 seconds.<br />\nTappan, Conolly and Iddings made<br />\na clean sweep of the high jump for<br />\nHopkins, the first two tying for<br />\nfirst place at 5 feet 44 inches.<br />\nHildebrandt won the shot-put for<br />\nY. M. C. A. with a put of 36 feet<br />\n4 inches. He and Brown were<br />\n7/<br />\nthe only Association men to capture<br />\nfirst places.<br />\nThere were also sonic novicc<br />\nevents run off for the purpose of<br />\ngiving the men on the squad, who<br />\nhad not yet had an opportunity to<br />\ncompete, a chance to show their<br />\nskill. In these, Steinback took first<br />\nplace in the 30-yard dash; McEwen<br />\n(J. H. U.) won the 220, and Frank.<br />\nalso of Hopkins, carried off the honors in the 449.<br />\nThe rain prevented a crowd from<br />\nattending.

But they are still just plain<br />\nrumors. The trustees have not<br />\nselected the president, but they are<br />\nnearing the goal.<br />\n\u2022 Rumors that Gilman Hall will be<br />\nused next fall for lecture-rooms and<br />\nfor the library have also been circulated. The magnificent new structure is practically finished, but it<br />\nwill not be occupied until the laboratories and other necessary structures complete the University group<br />\nat Homewood. The new technical<br />\nbuilding, however, is an exception.<br />\nAs soon as it is turned over by the<br />\ncontractors it will be fitted for instruction, and the engineering students will work there next October.<br />\nThere is, unfortunately, a current<br />\nopinion that the trustees are \"too<br />\nslow.\" Some think that a new<br />\npresident should be selected at once<br />\nand -that everything should be<br />\nmoved to Homewood on the day<br />\nafter his inauguration. It would be<br />\nvery good if this could be done<br />\nsuccessfully, i. e., without injury to<br />\nthe University. But such an action,<br />\nin the minds of the trustees, would<br />\nbe folly. Hopkins is not the richest<br />\nUniversity in the country, and its<br />\nmoves, involving both finance and<br />\npolicy, must be subjected to serious<br />\nforethought.<br />\nThe trustees of the University,<br />\na body both conservative and progressive, are fully aware of the fact<br />\n<br />\nthat delay is embarrassing, but when<br />\nthe delay means betterment, as it<br />\ndoes in the case of Homewood and<br />\nthe *president, they feel justified in<br />\ntaking time.<br />\nRumors are very funny things;<br />\nsome of those concerning the new<br />\npresident are actually hilarious. The<br />\nbest plan for all connected with<br />\nHopkins is that they devote the<br />\ntime they employ in gossiping about<br />\nthe new president to studying, and<br />\nperhaps in a few years they will be<br />\nqualified to be considered as candidates for the position themselves.<br />\nJack Cates, Coach.<br />\n<br />\nEveryone in the University is<br />\ngratified at the re-election of Mr.<br />\nCates to the 'Varsity head-coachship. When, early last season, it<br />\nwas announced that he had been<br />\nsecured as advisory coach, and that<br />\nhe could not devote his entire time<br />\nto the squad, it was considered a<br />\nmost fortunate acquisition for the<br />\nstaff. Later on in the season, however, he was induced to become<br />\nhead coach, and it was felt that<br />\nmuch progress would be made. The<br />\nteam did \"pick up\" materially, and<br />\nwhile the season was not a glowing<br />\nsuccess, there were no persons who<br />\nlaid the shortcomings of the team<br />\nor its candidates at the feet of Mr.<br />\nCates.<br />\nThe athletic leaders, the candidates for the team, and the student<br />\nbody, in fact, everyone interested in<br />\nHopkins football, were very highly<br />\npleased with Mr. Cates as coach,<br />\nand the opinion prevailed that he<br />\nshould be retained.<br />\nWith his recent re-election comes<br />\nthe prediction that the \"very best<br />\npossible\" showing will be made by<br />\nthe football team next fall. This<br />\nmeans that Mr. Cates will get as<br />\nmuch out of the squad as is possible.<br />\nIt now remains for the University<br />\nto provide an efficient squad. There<br />\nwill have to be a campaign, such as<br />\nis made by Harvard, Yale, Virginia,<br />\nPrinceton, and all other large colleges, carried on in the immediate<br />\nvicinity of Hopkins. The attractions of Hopkins, both as regards<br />\nstudy and sport, will have to be set<br />\nforth to promising athletes of<br />\nneighboring preparatory and high<br />\nschools. In other words, we shall<br />\nhave to get more material.<br />\nBesides, interest in football must<br />\nbe aroused right here in the University. The good players we now<br />\nhave must be retained, and new<br />\nplayers must be developed.<br />\nIt is not to be believed that the<br />\nAthletic Association can select one<br />\nof the very best coaches in the<br />\ncountry and then expect him \"to<br />\nmake a silk purse out of a sow's<br />\near.\"<br />\nMr. Cates will have to be supplied with the very best material<br />\navailable, and the only possible way<br />\nto bring this about is to begin right<br />\nnow to recruit forces for next fall's<br />\nteam.<br />\nWe have the best coach Johns<br />\nHopkins has ever had, and we shall<br />\nhave the best team we ever had if<br />\nwe begin now to get it together.<br />\n<br />\nal HUHN5111111111111111111111no<br />\n<br />\n4iitt11101111111111111117<br />\n<br />\nCLOTHES<br />\n<br />\nSMART<br />\n<br />\nYOUTHS AND YOUNG MEN<br />\nREADY TO PUT ON AND MADE TO MEASURE<br />\n<br />\nPLAZA BLDG.<br />\n<br />\n19 EAST<br />\nFAYETTE ST. \u2022<br />\n<br />\nE11111111111111111111191111111111IIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIII111111111111111111111111111IIIIIIIIII111111111111111a<br />\n<br />\nmimunri<br />\n<br />\nnflUHlllli<br />\n<br />\nLEFRANC & AULT<br />\n<br />\nWYMAN<br />\n<br />\nCOLLEGE SHOES<br />\nFOR<br />\nCOLLEGE MEN<br />\nThey look well\u2014 fit well\u2014wear well.<br />\nWe guarantee satisfaction<br />\n$4.00<br />\nThe YALE<br />\n4.50<br />\nThe PRINCETON<br />\n5.00<br />\nThe ENGLISH<br />\nThe MARYLAND (broad toe) 5.00<br />\n<br />\n( TAN<br />\n<br />\nGREY<br />\nGLOVES WHITE<br />\nCHAMOIS<br />\n<br />\n$1.00 to $2.00<br />\nAT THE<br />\n<br />\nVVYMAN, 19 Lexington St.<br />\n<br />\n\"SHIRT SHOP'<br />\n<br />\nXaltimore's Largest Shoe Store<br />\n<br />\n421 N.

Charles Francis Adams of Boston and Washington delivered the first of his course of<br />\neight lectures last Thursday before<br />\na representative audience that filled<br />\nevery available bit of space in McCoy Hall. The general subject of<br />\nthe course is \"1643-1865; a Nationality: Its Inception, Developand Birth.\" The first lecture was<br />\nentitled \"Principia,\" which served<br />\nmerely as an introduction to the<br />\nseries.<br />\nDr. Adams began by telling of<br />\nthe series of four lectures which he<br />\ndelivered under the Cecil Rhodes<br />\nFoundation at Oxford last spring.<br />\nHe described the audiences he met<br />\nand some of the experiences he had<br />\nwhile in England and dwelt in some<br />\ndetail on a correspendence he has<br />\nhad with Lord Bryce on the subject. He then proceeded to bridge<br />\nthe gap between himself and the<br />\naudience by giving a hasty review<br />\nof his antecedents and of his life.<br />\nAfter having done this, the lecturer<br />\ngave what he considered the three<br />\nmain issues which resulted from the<br />\nCivil War, namely: the growth of<br />\nUnited States nationality, the end<br />\nof man's dominion over man and<br />\nthe great impetus given to the cause<br />\nof democracy. These issues, Dr.<br />\nAdams said, he hoped to develop<br />\nfully without the usual obstacles<br />\nwhich generally hamper historians,<br />\nnamely: religion, patriotism and political preconception.<br />\nJudging by the introductory lecture, the series gives signs of being a highly instructive and interesting one.<br />\nThe remaining lectures of the<br />\ncourse and their dates are: Tuesday, January 27, \"The Pitfall of<br />\na Divided Sovereignty\"; Thursday,<br />\nFebruary 5, \"King Cotton\"; Thursday, February 12, \"The Lancashire<br />\nArmageddon\"; Thursday, February<br />\n19, \"British Civil War Cartoons\";<br />\nThursday, February 26, \"A Crisis<br />\nin Downing Street\"; Thursday,<br />\nMarch 5, \"Expende Hannibalem\";<br />\nThursday, March 12, \"Vae Victis,<br />\nand Reconstruction.\" .<br />\n<br />\nThe Johns Hopkins Alumni Association of New York and New<br />\nJersey has authorized the preparation of a catalogue of all present<br />\nand former officers and students of<br />\nthe University, to be presented to<br />\nthe trustees of our alma mater on<br />\nthe occasion of the inauguration of<br />\nthe buildings on the new site at<br />\nHomewood. In order to facilitate<br />\nthe work, two cards have been sent<br />\nto all the students and alumni of<br />\nthe University, with the request<br />\nthat they be filled out in duplicate<br />\nand forwarded to the committee.<br />\nOne of these cards will be kept in<br />\nthe New York office of the committee, while the publication is in<br />\ncourse of preparation, and the other<br />\nwill be filed with the Registrar of<br />\nthe University at Baltimore.<br />\nGreat difficulty is being experienced in securing a reasonably complete register of names. In order,<br />\ntherefore, that this work, which has<br />\nbeen aptly described as a \"Who's<br />\nWho From J. H.

M. C.

Mr. Willard succeeds Dr.<br />\nWilliam H. Buckler the noted archaeologist who, at one time, was<br />\nconsidered the probable next president of the University.<br />\nDr. Buckler resigned from the<br />\nBoard two years ago, when he went<br />\nabroad to carry on archaeological<br />\ninvestigation in Asia.<br />\nOwing to the fact that he has<br />\nkept in constant touch with Hopkins matters, and although absent,<br />\nhas done much for the advancement<br />\nof the University, the place had not<br />\nbeen filled.<br />\nA committee, consisting of Dr.<br />\nWilliam H. Welch, chairman of<br />\nthe Board of Administration; R.<br />\nBrent Keyser, chairman of the<br />\nBoard of Trustees, and B. Howell<br />\nGriswold, Jr., called on Mr. Willard<br />\nseveral weeks ago and urged him<br />\nto accept the Hopkins trusteeship.<br />\nAs Mr. Willard wrote his letter of<br />\nacceptance last week, the meeting<br />\nof the trustees was'merely in the<br />\nnature of a formal ratification of<br />\nhis acceptance.<br />\nMr.. Keyser said that Mr. Willard's acceptance was a source of<br />\ngreat gratification to him and the<br />\nother members of the Board. He<br />\nregards Mr. Willard as a strong<br />\nacquisition.<br />\nDean Griffin also expressed this<br />\ngratification at the selection of such<br />\na talented executive as Mr. Willard for the position of trustee of<br />\nthe University.<br />\n\u2022<br />\nThe new trustee is a man of the<br />\nhighest intellectual and executive<br />\nabilities. He is a self-made man<br />\nin the highest sense of the word,<br />\nhaving risen to his present high<br />\nposition from the humble position<br />\nof section foreman. He has always<br />\nbeen a close personal friend of Dr.<br />\n\\Velch and Mr. Keyser, and the<br />\nconsequent close touch with the<br />\naims and ideals of the University<br />\nhas aroused in him a very keen interest in its future. Mr. Willard,<br />\nthough a comparatively young railroad president, was very recently<br />\nchosen by his colleagues to represent all the railroad systems of the<br />\nEast at the recent rate, hearings before the Interstate Commerce Commission.<br /><br />\nThe University Musical Clubs<br />\nmade a trip to Port Deposit last<br />\nSaturday, and gave a concert there<br />\nin Memorial Hall of the Tome<br />\nSchool. The following men made<br />\nthe trip: Messrs. White, Hayes,<br />\nEiseman, Bowden, Scovell, Spieker,<br />\nSupplee, Snyder, Rutledge, Weber,<br />\nMelamet, Stollenwerck, Primrose,<br />\nHall, Weech, Lynch, Smith, Geissel,<br />\nHowell, Doub, Gailey, Baker, Biser,<br />\nReier, Lauchheimer, Owens, Coblentz, Bacchus, Gillet, Fulton and<br />\nE. L. R. Smith. Leaving Baltimore<br />\nabout one o'clock, the musicians arrived at Tome in time to play a very<br />\namateurish basketball game with<br />\nthe Tome team. Our men had no<br />\npractice and of course were badly<br />\nbeaten. The concert at night was<br />\ngiven in the Memorial Hall. There<br />\nwere about 3oo in the audience.<br />\nmostly boys, with some members of<br />\nthe faculty and a few ladies. The<br />\naudience was, no doubt, the most<br />\nappreciative one that our men have<br />\never played to. It did one good<br />\nto hear them applaud; it went and<br />\ncame straight from the heart.

Hollander, head of the economic<br />\ndepartment, for membership on the<br />\nnew Federal Reserve Board. Senator Hollis, of New Hampshire, it<br />\nwas said, is believed to be Dr. Hollander's sponsor, and friends of the<br />\nprofessor attach more credence to<br />\nthe dispatches because he and the<br />\nPresident have known each other<br />\nas university professors.<br />\nIt is remembered that Dr. Hollander has done excellent service<br />\nfor the country before in handling<br />\nthe finances of Santo Domingo;<br />\nsuggesting government reforms for<br />\nCuba, and in organizing the treasury of Porto Rico when the island<br />\nwas taken over by the United States<br />\nafter the Spanish. war.<br />\nThe rumor that he is now slated<br />\nfor membership on the Reserve<br />\nBoard is based on a speech delivered before the Bankers' Association of Washington on Saturday<br />\nnight. Senator Hollis said in his<br />\nspeech that the senate had agreed<br />\nnot to suggest names for the Board<br />\nto the President, but that he had<br />\nviolated the compact by suggesting<br />\none name. He further said:<br />\n\"He is a Republican, too; I consider him one of the greatest financial experts in the world. One of<br />\nthe remarkable things he did was to<br />\nwrite an article in which he pointed<br />\nout the faults of the old banking<br />\nand currency system and predicted<br />\nthat a nation-wide money panic<br />\nwould result. Well, the panic came.<br />\nIt seemed to me that a man so<br />\nthoroughly familiar with currency<br />\nproblems would be a good man to<br />\nhave on that Board.\"<br />\nSenator Hollis, from the point of<br />\nview of university men, is quite correct in his praise of Dr. Hollander,<br />\nbut he is perhaps mistaken in calling the professor a Republican.<br />\n(Continued on page 5, col. 2)<br /><br />\nBy defeating the team of the Baltimore Y.

The trustees have not<br />\nselected the president, but they are<br />\nnearing the goal.<br />\n\u2022 Rumors that Gilman Hall will be<br />\nused next fall for lecture-rooms and<br />\nfor the library have also been circulated.

The new technical<br />\nbuilding, however, is an exception.<br />\nAs soon as it is turned over by the<br />\ncontractors it will be fitted for instruction, and the engineering students will work there next October.<br />\nThere is, unfortunately, a current<br />\nopinion that the trustees are \"too<br />\nslow.\" Some think that a new<br />\npresident should be selected at once<br />\nand -that everything should be<br />\nmoved to Homewood on the day<br />\nafter his inauguration. It would be<br />\nvery good if this could be done<br />\nsuccessfully, i. e., without injury to<br />\nthe University. But such an action,<br />\nin the minds of the trustees, would<br />\nbe folly.

The<br />\nbest plan for all connected with<br />\nHopkins is that they devote the<br />\ntime they employ in gossiping about<br />\nthe new president to studying, and<br />\nperhaps in a few years they will be<br />\nqualified to be considered as candidates for the position themselves.<br />\nJack Cates, Coach.<br /><br />\nEveryone in the University is<br />\ngratified at the re-election of Mr.<br />\nCates to the 'Varsity head-coachship. When, early last season, it<br />\nwas announced that he had been<br />\nsecured as advisory coach, and that<br />\nhe could not devote his entire time<br />\nto the squad, it was considered a<br />\nmost fortunate acquisition for the<br />\nstaff. Later on in the season, however, he was induced to become<br />\nhead coach, and it was felt that<br />\nmuch progress would be made. The<br />\nteam did \"pick up\" materially, and<br />\nwhile the season was not a glowing<br />\nsuccess, there were no persons who<br />\nlaid the shortcomings of the team<br />\nor its candidates at the feet of Mr.<br />\nCates.<br />\nThe athletic leaders, the candidates for the team, and the student<br />\nbody, in fact, everyone interested in<br />\nHopkins football, were very highly<br />\npleased with Mr. Cates as coach,<br />\nand the opinion prevailed that he<br />\nshould be retained.<br />\nWith his recent re-election comes<br />\nthe prediction that the \"very best<br />\npossible\" showing will be made by<br />\nthe football team next fall. This<br />\nmeans that Mr. Cates will get as<br />\nmuch out of the squad as is possible.<br />\nIt now remains for the University<br />\nto provide an efficient squad. There<br />\nwill have to be a campaign, such as<br />\nis made by Harvard, Yale, Virginia,<br />\nPrinceton, and all other large colleges, carried on in the immediate<br />\nvicinity of Hopkins. The attractions of Hopkins, both as regards<br />\nstudy and sport, will have to be set<br />\nforth to promising athletes of<br />\nneighboring preparatory and high<br />\nschools. In other words, we shall<br />\nhave to get more material.<br />\nBesides, interest in football must<br />\nbe aroused right here in the University. The good players we now<br />\nhave must be retained, and new<br />\nplayers must be developed.<br />\nIt is not to be believed that the<br />\nAthletic Association can select one<br />\nof the very best coaches in the<br />\ncountry and then expect him \"to<br />\nmake a silk purse out of a sow's<br />\near.\"<br />\nMr. Cates will have to be supplied with the very best material<br />\navailable, and the only possible way<br />\nto bring this about is to begin right<br />\nnow to recruit forces for next fall's<br />\nteam.<br />\nWe have the best coach Johns<br />\nHopkins has ever had, and we shall<br />\nhave the best team we ever had if<br />\nwe begin now to get it together.<br /><br />\nal HUHN5111111111111111111111no<br /><br />\n4iitt11101111111111111117<br /><br />\nCLOTHES<br /><br />\nSMART<br /><br />\nYOUTHS AND YOUNG MEN<br />\nREADY TO PUT ON AND MADE TO MEASURE<br /><br />\nPLAZA BLDG.<br /><br />\n19 EAST<br />\nFAYETTE ST. \u2022<br /><br />\nE11111111111111111111191111111111IIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIII111111111111111111111111111IIIIIIIIII111111111111111a<br /><br />\nmimunri<br /><br />\nnflUHlllli<br /><br />\nLEFRANC &amp; AULT<br /><br />\nWYMAN<br /><br />\nCOLLEGE SHOES<br />\nFOR<br />\nCOLLEGE MEN<br />\nThey look well\u2014 fit well\u2014wear well.<br />\nWe guarantee satisfaction<br />\n$4.00<br />\nThe YALE<br />\n4.50<br />\nThe PRINCETON<br />\n5.00<br />\nThe ENGLISH<br />\nThe MARYLAND (broad toe) 5.00<br /><br />\n( TAN<br /><br />\nGREY<br />\nGLOVES WHITE<br />\nCHAMOIS<br /><br />\n$1.00 to $2.00<br />\nAT THE<br /><br />\nVVYMAN, 19 Lexington St.<br /><br />\n\"SHIRT SHOP'<br /><br />\nXaltimore's Largest Shoe Store<br /><br />\n421 N.

Charles Francis Adams' First Lecture is Well Received The Series<br />\nInstructing and Interesting.<br /><br />\nNew York and New Jersey Societies<br />\nGetting Up Volume as Homewood<br />\nInauguration Souvenir.<br /><br />\nThe Hon. Charles Francis Adams of Boston and Washington delivered the first of his course of<br />\neight lectures last Thursday before<br />\na representative audience that filled<br />\nevery available bit of space in McCoy Hall. The general subject of<br />\nthe course is \"1643-1865; a Nationality: Its Inception, Developand Birth.\" The first lecture was<br />\nentitled \"Principia,\" which served<br />\nmerely as an introduction to the<br />\nseries.<br />\nDr. Adams began by telling of<br />\nthe series of four lectures which he<br />\ndelivered under the Cecil Rhodes<br />\nFoundation at Oxford last spring.<br />\nHe described the audiences he met<br />\nand some of the experiences he had<br />\nwhile in England and dwelt in some<br />\ndetail on a correspendence he has<br />\nhad with Lord Bryce on the subject. He then proceeded to bridge<br />\nthe gap between himself and the<br />\naudience by giving a hasty review<br />\nof his antecedents and of his life.<br />\nAfter having done this, the lecturer<br />\ngave what he considered the three<br />\nmain issues which resulted from the<br />\nCivil War, namely: the growth of<br />\nUnited States nationality, the end<br />\nof man's dominion over man and<br />\nthe great impetus given to the cause<br />\nof democracy. These issues, Dr.<br />\nAdams said, he hoped to develop<br />\nfully without the usual obstacles<br />\nwhich generally hamper historians,<br />\nnamely: religion, patriotism and political preconception.<br />\nJudging by the introductory lecture, the series gives signs of being a highly instructive and interesting one.<br />\nThe remaining lectures of the<br />\ncourse and their dates are: Tuesday, January 27, \"The Pitfall of<br />\na Divided Sovereignty\"; Thursday,<br />\nFebruary 5, \"King Cotton\"; Thursday, February 12, \"The Lancashire<br />\nArmageddon\"; Thursday, February<br />\n19, \"British Civil War Cartoons\";<br />\nThursday, February 26, \"A Crisis<br />\nin Downing Street\"; Thursday,<br />\nMarch 5, \"Expende Hannibalem\";<br />\nThursday, March 12, \"Vae Victis,<br />\nand Reconstruction.\" .<br /><br />\nThe Johns Hopkins Alumni Association of New York and New<br />\nJersey has authorized the preparation of a catalogue of all present<br />\nand former officers and students of<br />\nthe University, to be presented to<br />\nthe trustees of our alma mater on<br />\nthe occasion of the inauguration of<br />\nthe buildings on the new site at<br />\nHomewood. In order to facilitate<br />\nthe work, two cards have been sent<br />\nto all the students and alumni of<br />\nthe University, with the request<br />\nthat they be filled out in duplicate<br />\nand forwarded to the committee.<br />\nOne of these cards will be kept in<br />\nthe New York office of the committee, while the publication is in<br />\ncourse of preparation, and the other<br />\nwill be filed with the Registrar of<br />\nthe University at Baltimore.<br />\nGreat difficulty is being experienced in securing a reasonably complete register of names. In order,<br />\ntherefore, that this work, which has<br />\nbeen aptly described as a \"Who's<br />\nWho From J. H. U.,\" shall be as<br />\nnearly complete as possible, the<br />\ncommittee particularly requests that<br />\nspecial attention be given to the last<br />\nquestion on the cards, which asks<br />\nfor information regarding any of<br />\nthe former 'Hopkins men with<br />\nwhom the signer may be acquainted.<br />\nThe Committee in charge of this<br />\nwork consists of Elgin R.
