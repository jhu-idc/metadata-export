Many people at Johns Hopkins (official and unofficial)<br />\nconsider axiomatic the assertion that a student must entertain a<br />\nsort of fanatical enthusiasm for his studies to be rated a \"good\"<br />\nstudent.<br />\nSuch people would naturally deprecate activities unqualifiedly<br />\nwithout attempting to discover wherein the undesirability lies. And<br />\nthere is a danger, it is true.<br />\nThe danger, as has been said many times in the past, lies in<br />\noverdoing them. It is unfortunate that, as soon as a man finds<br />\nhimself successful in one activity, he believes it his duty to himself or his fraternity to try out two or three more. His success<br />\nin the first endeavor gives him a reputation on which he rides to\u2022<br />\ngreater heights in the succeeding attempts.<br />\nThe results are obvious. Activities become the man's vocation instead of his avocation. He becomes a \"campus leader.\" He<br />\nstudies whenever he may find time. He achieves Success, and incidentally forfeits part of his education.<br />\nAnother result of the existing scheme of activities is that the<br />\nreal \"kick\" derived from participation is tasted by a small minority.<br />\nMost students think that the only ones who genuinely enjoy their<br />\nwork on activities are those at the head, those about whom a certain glamor attaches itself. Consequently, these others take no interest. Moreover, if a student knows that he has not sufficient time<br />\nto devote to three or four activities, he will not attempt any at all.<br />\nPresident Goodnow does not entertain the belief that under<br />\nthe New Plan it will be possible for a man to devote time to more<br />\nthan one or two activities. He does, probably, hope that activities<br />\nwill exist as avocations, for he will not allow them to be raisons<br />\nd'etre of students' college careers.<br />\n<br />\nGO GET 'EM, BOYS!<br />\nThe most colorful tradition on the campus is undoubtedly<br />\nthe banquet season. Everyone, from the Hopkins reporters on the<br />\ndailies to the members of the Greek department, catches the banquet Spirit in much the same way as young and old throw themselves into the spirit of Christmas. The banquet excitement, coming at the very time when spring fever is most likely to creep into<br />\n, the veins of man, should, in reality be indicative of the expenditure<br />\nget 'em, boys!<br />\nof much energy.<br />\n<br />\na<br />\n<br />\nOne of the best was a New Plan<br />\nstudent who tried to name the last<br />\nfive deans of the College of Arts<br />\nand Sciences.

Many people at Johns Hopkins (official and unofficial)<br />\nconsider axiomatic the assertion that a student must entertain a<br />\nsort of fanatical enthusiasm for his studies to be rated a \"good\"<br />\nstudent.<br />\nSuch people would naturally deprecate activities unqualifiedly<br />\nwithout attempting to discover wherein the undesirability lies. And<br />\nthere is a danger, it is true.<br />\nThe danger, as has been said many times in the past, lies in<br />\noverdoing them. It is unfortunate that, as soon as a man finds<br />\nhimself successful in one activity, he believes it his duty to himself or his fraternity to try out two or three more. His success<br />\nin the first endeavor gives him a reputation on which he rides to\u2022<br />\ngreater heights in the succeeding attempts.<br />\nThe results are obvious. Activities become the man's vocation instead of his avocation. He becomes a \"campus leader.\" He<br />\nstudies whenever he may find time. He achieves Success, and incidentally forfeits part of his education.<br />\nAnother result of the existing scheme of activities is that the<br />\nreal \"kick\" derived from participation is tasted by a small minority.<br />\nMost students think that the only ones who genuinely enjoy their<br />\nwork on activities are those at the head, those about whom a certain glamor attaches itself. Consequently, these others take no interest. Moreover, if a student knows that he has not sufficient time<br />\nto devote to three or four activities, he will not attempt any at all.<br />\nPresident Goodnow does not entertain the belief that under<br />\nthe New Plan it will be possible for a man to devote time to more<br />\nthan one or two activities. He does, probably, hope that activities<br />\nwill exist as avocations, for he will not allow them to be raisons<br />\nd'etre of students' college careers.<br /><br />\nGO GET 'EM, BOYS!<br />\nThe most colorful tradition on the campus is undoubtedly<br />\nthe banquet season. Everyone, from the Hopkins reporters on the<br />\ndailies to the members of the Greek department, catches the banquet Spirit in much the same way as young and old throw themselves into the spirit of Christmas.
