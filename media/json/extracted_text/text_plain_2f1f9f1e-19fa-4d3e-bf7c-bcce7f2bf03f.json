Although his appointment<br />\nis not yet official, Michael<br />\nMcCormick is in the process of<br />\njoining the faculty at Harvard<br />\nUnversity.<br />\nHarvard's offer to McCormick, a Byzantinist, was an<br />\nacademic opportunity that<br />\nHopkins probably could not have<br />\nmatched. According to McCormick, the \"opportunity for<br />\nmedieval studies may be greater<br />\nat [Harvard] than [Hopkins].\"<br />\nDepartment Chair Richard<br />\nGoldthwaite speculated that Harvard's resources, including its<br />\nenormous library and the \"larger<br />\nscholarly community in his<br />\nfield...might make the place<br />\nmuch more appealing.\"<br />\nGreene, a specialist in<br />\n<br />\nAmerican colonial history, said<br />\nthat there were' no powerful push<br />\nfactors\" involved in his decision<br />\nto leave Hopkins, although there<br />\n\"were some pull factors.\"<br />\nGreene cited his desire to live in<br />\nSouthern California as one of<br />\nthese.<br />\nAccording to Freehling, \"the<br />\nposition I was offered [at SUNYBuffalo] was so much better in<br />\nevery way\" that it was far<br />\nsuperior to anything Hopkins<br />\nhads to offer. Freehling, who is<br />\npopular among undergraduates,<br />\nwas offered the John Lockwood<br />\nendowed chair, a $25,000<br />\nresearch grant, a half-time<br />\nsecretary, and a salary estimated<br />\nat twice that he had at Hopkins.<br />\nIn the absence of a counter offer by Hopkins, Freehling said he<br />\naccepted. He added that \"no real<br />\neffort was made\" on the part of<br />\nthe University, and noted the two<br />\npositions currently vacant in the<br />\nhistory department.<br />\nGreene said the University<br />\n\"could have acted long before the<br />\noffer materialized\" to keep<br />\nFreehling. He added that younger<br />\nprofessors like Freehling have<br />\nbeen \"enormously underpaid\"<br />\nand were \"not quite treated as<br />\nwell as older professors.\"<br />\nAccording to Goldthwaite, a<br />\ndepartment as exceptional as<br />\nHopkins' continually finds its<br />\nfaculty receiving job offers. \"It's<br />\na fact of the academic market,\"<br />\n<br />\nhe said. \"You have a good faculty so other universities are going<br />\nto want them.<br />\n\"We try to resist these offers,<br />\nbut we're not always successful,\"<br />\nhe said.<br />\nMcCormick agreed that it is a<br />\n\"normal situation [for] distinguished departments [to receive]<br />\noffers every year.\" He felt,<br />\nhowever, that there should be<br />\n\"concern when offers begin to be<br />\naccepted.\"<br />\nThe loss of Greene and Freehling, a specialist in Antebellum<br />\nU.S. history, has hurt\u2014some<br />\nwould say crippled\u2014the department's American history program<br />\nat Hopkins. Goldthwaite said he<br />\nhas not yet talked with Dean of<br />\nArts and Sciences Lloyd Armstrong, but \"assumes that [the<br />\ndepartment] will be able to recruit<br />\npeople.\"<br />\nHe said that Daniel Walkowitz,<br />\na full professor at New York<br />\nUniversity, Will be a visiting<br />\nscholar next year. He added that<br />\n\"there is a possibility [that the<br />\ndepartment] may get some temporary teaching assistants.\"<br />\n<br />\nAccording to Freehling,<br />\nhowever, \"bringing in a visiting<br />\nprofessor cannot change\" the<br />\nenormous hole left in American<br />\nhistory.<br />\nGoldthwaite said that the size<br />\nof Hopkins places limitations on<br />\nhis department that it must contend with when competing with<br />\nlarger peer departments. Because<br />\nof financial constraints, he said<br />\nhis department attempts to<br />\n\"create a more congenial environment for scholars to work<br />\nin\" with \"the kind of program [it<br />\nhas].\"<br />\nAccording to Greene, though,<br />\nthere are growing concerns<br />\namong faculty, and notjust within<br />\nthe history department, that the<br />\nunique character of Hopkins is in<br />\njeopardy.

To the accusation that Kanner's facts were<br />\nunfounded, Roberts cited the<br />\nsources from which these<br />\nnumbers were taken.

This wasn't the way<br />\nthe year was supposed to finish.<br />\nShe was supposed to go out with<br />\na smile and a wink and say<br />\nsomething pithy about how they'd<br />\nall do it again next year.<br />\nUnfortunately, she was breaking up with her boyfriend. This,<br />\nin her opinion, was not the way<br />\nto end a year.<br />\nShe languidly shuffled out of<br />\nher room and towards the kitchen. Zack was laying on the<br />\ncouch asleep. This almost made<br />\nher feel better, but then she<br />\nremembered that she was determined that her last days at school<br />\nwould be filled with self-pity.<br />\nDoris had a glass in the<br />\nmicrowave again. Miranda<br />\nwasn't even amused. Breaking up<br />\nhad that sort of effect on you. All<br />\nthe old jokes weren't funny<br />\nanymore. Heck, even the new<br />\njokes weren't funny anymore,<br />\nwhich she could tell by Zack's<br />\ncontinued presence.<br />\nDoris came in, sobbing. Great,<br />\nMiranda thought. Last night was<br />\nDoris' big goodbye to Chris.<br />\nMiranda hoped the goodbye<br />\nwasn't as big as it seemed.<br />\n\"What's wrong, Doris?\" she<br />\nasked with as much interest as she<br />\ncould muster.<br />\n\"I don't want to talk about<br />\nit,\"Doris sobbed.<br />\n\"Fine by me,\" Miranda said,<br />\nturning back to the kitchen.<br />\nDoris broke out in a cry.<br />\nMiranda could ignore sobbing,<br />\nbut a cry demanded even her<br />\napathetic attentions.<br />\n\"Now what, Doris?\"<br />\n\"Nothing.\"<br />\n\"Oh?\"<br />\n\"HebrokeupwithmeIhatehimIhatemyselfIjustwanttoDIE!\"<br />\nMiranda chalked off another<br />\none for Spring. Even though<br />\nDoris hadn't been going out for<br />\nthree years, even though she<br />\nhadn't come a hair-breadth's<br />\naway from marriage, even though<br />\nshe didn't have to conduct her<br />\n<br />\nrelationship over three thousand<br />\nmiles, she probably still needed<br />\ncaring and compassion.<br />\n\"Is that all?\" Miranda asked.<br />\nDoris pushed it up to a wail.<br />\n\"Hrnhmm?\" hrnhmmed Zack,<br />\nwalking into the hall groggily.<br />\n\"Doris and Chris broke up.\"<br />\nDoris moved from a wail to a<br />\nscreech. Miranda wondered how<br />\n<br />\nIn the final installment<br />\nof 'The Miranda Act,'<br />\nDoris weeps, Zack<br />\nconfesses, Carol breaks<br />\nup, and Miranda seethes<br />\n<br />\nmany settings she came with.<br />\n\"Oh,\" Zack said, mustering<br />\nabout as much sympathy as<br />\nMiranda was able.<br />\nDeciding that taunting Doris<br />\nwas probably out of taste, Miranda instead turned on Zack.<br />\n\"Besides, why are you still<br />\nhere anyway?\" she demanded.<br />\n\"I'm a running gag,\" Zack<br />\nquipped. \"Besides, didn't we go<br />\nthrough this whole thing already?<br />\nI'm only a guest.\"<br />\n\"Even after we set up your<br />\nwhole apartment and all?\"<br />\n\"Especially after. You don't<br />\nget it, do you?\"<br />\n\"Get what?\"<br />\n\"Why I never leave.\"<br />\n\"You're broke?\"<br />\n\"Well, other than that.\"<br />\n\"What.\"<br />\n\"I'd actually miss you guys.\"<br />\nThat did it for Doris, who<br />\nstarted bawling and hugging<br />\nZack. Miranda thought of a snide<br />\nobservation, but for once kept it<br />\nto herself.<br />\n\"Come on, Zack. You've got<br />\na life. . . what about your<br />\ngirlfriend?\"<br />\n\"Huh? Who?\"<br />\nMiranda almost hit him, but<br />\nthen he seemed to remember.<br />\n\"Oh, we broke up a while<br />\nContinued on page 5<br />\n<br />\nDear William<br />\nKing Richard Williamson XX was undoubtedly the happiest man<br />\nin the northeastern United States. From the piddling beginnings of<br />\nhis predecessors, he had managed to expand the Johns Hopkins<br />\nKingdom into a vibrant corporation, a profitable enterprise that cast<br />\nits shadow over continents as large as Africa and Asia. William had<br />\nhis hands in more pies than he could count\u2014polystyrene for the poor,<br />\nan archival project with 20th-century quadrophonic recordings, giraffe<br />\nand antelope cloning, and a proposed renaissance of acidic paper for<br />\nhistory books\u2014and the number grew every day. Six hundred years<br />\nhad passed since the schizophrenic Johns Hopkins had founded his<br />\nuniversity on the German model in 1876; now it controlled the lives<br />\nof billions. If the sun had never set ,on the Victorian Empire, who<br />\ncared? William had subsidiary rights to the sun and was underwriting<br />\nthe manufacture of another to speed global warming. Progress, he<br />\nhad learned, often came in strange guises.<br />\nLately, though, William had been haunted by ghosts from the past.<br />\nAn archival team from the Chesapeake Division had begun excavation of the university's original property to prepare it for the sexticentennial celebration next year, and he was expected to sift through<br />\nthe findings. The majority of the stuff was straightforward: evidence<br />\nof the 22nd-century administration genocide (a nasty business), pamphlets announcing the 2005 Tuition Hike Riot, and a mountain of<br />\nhumanitarian awards presented to William Richardson, his 20thcentury forerunner who had mangled the corporate structure in the<br />\nname of \"improving education.\" Silly man\u2014his time was long past.<br />\nBut King William was tickled by the minutiae the team had ex-<br />\n<br />\ntracted from what one operative called 'the little ditch building,' apparently the office for the student newspaper. The findings were thin<br />\n(the little nips, it seemed, had kept rather sloppy records) but there<br />\nwas a healthy amount of rotting paper from 1987 to 1991, the years<br />\njust before the building was annihilated by a wandering Patriot<br />\nmissile\u2014built, William noted, with Johns Hopkins APL technology.<br />\nWhat audacity the little newspaper twerps had had! He leafed through<br />\nthe issues from 1991, stunned into silence by the cavilling tone, the<br />\npathetic demands of the students. Smaller faculty? Lower tuition?<br />\nCampus diversity? He imagined the reaction of the administration<br />\nat the time. They probably listened patiently, tossed the paper into<br />\none of those quaint recycling buckets the team had dug up, and then<br />\nlaughed the students out the door.<br />\nWilliam, for his part, would have crushed them like ants. He could<br />\nsee no function for a student newspaper\u2014even then, when administrators might have read it. It stood in the way of progress, championed bourgeois values, and provided a forum\u2014William felt his pancreas flutter in disgust\u2014for student opinion. He glanced gratefully<br />\nat the portrait of Steven Muller, the university president who had<br />\nat least laid the groundwork for the oppression of the stupid publication. There was a man, he thought, who had priorities.<br />\nSeveral hours later, after sifting through more of the student<br />\neditorials than he cared to remember, William unleashed a relaxing<br />\nfart. His eye had locked on an item from an editorial page almost<br />\n500 years old. It read, \"Dear William\"<br />\n<br />\nLetters<br />\nWho Filched the Flags?; P.C. Is Wrong, but Don't Let the<br />\nBacklash Damage Progress; Hearing Cries of 'Union!'<br />\nTo the Editors:<br />\nOn Thursday night, April 18,just<br />\nas the the Spring Fair committee<br />\nmembers were finishing the final<br />\npreparations for Fair, eight flags<br />\nwhich had been hung in the<br />\nbreezeways between Merganthaler<br />\nand Remsen and Krieger and Ames,<br />\nwere discovered to have been stolen.<br />\nThe flags, which were intended to be<br />\ndecorations to complement the international theme of this year's Fair,<br />\nhad all been loaned to Spring Fair by<br />\nforeign embassies, under the condition that they be returned after Fair<br />\nunharmed. Unfortunately, this will<br />\nnot happen.<br />\nSpring Fair assumes part of the<br />\nblame for the loss of the flags, having naively overestimated the<br />\nmaturity and common sense of the<br />\nstudent population. Security, as well,<br />\nwas nowhere to be seen on the night<br />\nthe flags disappeared. Regardless of<br />\nwhere the blame lies, Spring Fair is<br />\nnow in the embarrassing position of<br />\nhaving to explain to eight foreign<br />\nembassies why, at one of the nation's<br />\nmost prestigious universities, this<br />\nwas allowed to happen.<br />\nOn a more positive note, one<br />\nanonymous person returned the<br />\nNigerian flag to the Spring Fair Office on Monday morning. Let's hope<br />\nmore than one person on this campus has a conscience. Flags can be<br />\nreturned, no questions asked, to the<br />\nSpring Fair Office in Levering Hall,<br />\neither by hand or through Campus<br />\nMail. We would really appreciate it.<br />\nLuciene Pisa<br />\nTo the Editors:<br />\nI am writing to respond to a statement made in the April 1991, issue<br />\nof the Spectator. Many of the unthinkable statements made in the<br />\nissue reflect a dangerous undercurrent to its backlash against the<br />\nPolitically Correct movement.<br />\nIn David Cohen's article<br />\n(\"Politics' Corruption of Higher<br />\nEducation: Tenured Radicals\") he<br />\nderisively states, \"Navajo farming<br />\ntechniques are to be accorded the<br />\nsame respect as Platonic<br />\nphilosophy.\" While I don't believe<br />\nthat agricultural practices are<br />\ngenerally on the same level as<br />\nphilosophy, I wonder if the author<br />\nhas ever considered the nature of the<br />\nNavajo religion, a religion much<br />\nmore entwined with the natural<br />\nworld than traditional Western<br />\nreligions. For all Mr. Cohen knows,<br />\nNavajo farming techniques could be<br />\nreflective of something as profound<br />\nas The Allegory of the Cave, but it<br />\ndoesn't seem to be something he has<br />\nlooking into.<br />\nUnfortunately, ignorance in Native<br />\nhistory is the norm. Consider Allan<br />\nBloom, who is mentioned in the next<br />\nparagraph as having \"fired the first<br />\nsalvo in defense of traditional learning.\" Although I have not read his<br />\nbook, I did attend his MSE<br />\nSymposium-sponsored speech last<br />\nyear. My most vivid memory of the<br />\nwhole evening was his out-of-hand<br />\nrejection (during the question-andanswer session) that any American<br />\nIndian tribe could have had<br />\ndemocratic governments before<br />\nEuropeans arrived. Whether or not<br />\nthey did (and many of them did), this<br />\nattitude is deeply offensive to me as<br />\na Native American. The traditonal<br />\nlearning he defends does not include<br />\nstudy of the Six Nations of the Iroquois Confederation. Nor does it include study of present day Native<br />\n<br />\nAmericans, like Wilma Mankiller,<br />\nPrincipal Chief of the Cherokee Nation (a sovereign nation with<br />\nsovereign laws).<br />\nI agree with the Spectator that the<br />\nPC school of thought, and especially its methods, are dangerous, but it<br />\nseems to me that all it offers is an<br />\nAllan Bloom-ish return to the status<br />\nqui ante. There is much enthnocentricity ingrained in American society, beginning with the idea that Columbus \"discovered\" America 500<br />\nyears ago, and sadly not ending with<br />\nAllen Bloom. There are inequalities<br />\nthat need to be addressed, especially when ignorance leads to pockets<br />\nof the Third World in America. Our<br />\nsociety is not going to ameliorate the<br />\ndesperate conditions of many tribes<br />\nif it doesn't know they exist. Traditional learning needs to change to<br />\nreflect real life. Obviously the PC<br />\nmovement is not the way to go about<br />\nit, but neither is what the Spectator<br />\nsuggests.<br />\nKrista Hegburg<br />\nTo the Editors:<br />\nOver the course of the last several<br />\nmonths, the University has been going through the process of planning<br />\nextensive renovations for Levering<br />\nHall (the Student Union). Several<br />\nmonths ago, a preliminary report<br />\nwas issued on the subject which<br />\nmany subjects had access to. Student<br />\nopinion on that report was solicited<br />\nat that time by the administration. In<br />\nthe past few weeks, a new report was<br />\nreceived by the University from the<br />\narchitects. The contents of this report<br />\nhave not yet been made available to<br />\nstudents.<br />\nI have been told by the administration that at the moment there is no<br />\nset time table for making final plans<br />\non renovations, and that I shouldn't<br />\nworry about student input being lost.<br />\nThat type of statement worries me.<br />\nWith no time table existing, I fear<br />\nthat these decisions are going to be<br />\nput off until the summer, at which<br />\ntime there will be little chance of<br />\nreceiving student input. It would be<br />\na big mistake to make decisions over<br />\nthe summer that will have such far<br />\nreaching effects on students for years<br />\nto come. The new Student Union is<br />\njust too important for that to happen.<br />\nI want to urge the administration to<br />\nset and publicize a time table on<br />\nplanning, as well as publicizing<br />\nmethods through which students can<br />\nvoice their opinions. The student<br />\nbody knows better than anyone else<br />\nwhat they want to see in a Student<br />\n<br />\nSince this is the last issue of<br />\nthe News-Letter for the<br />\nSpring 1991 semester, we<br />\nask that you hold all hate<br />\nmail until the beginning of<br />\nnext semester. At that time,<br />\nwe will gladly accept your<br />\npompous opinions and give<br />\nyou a chance to hop on your<br />\nvery own soapbox as long<br />\nas you follow these requirements: letters must be<br />\ntyped, double spaced, no<br />\nmore than 350 words, and<br />\ninclude the author's name<br />\nand telephone number. Letters must be signed by at<br />\nleast one but no more than<br />\n<br />\nUnion, and it would be a tragic<br />\nmistake not to listen to students on<br />\nthis matter.<br />\nDavid DuTot<br />\nTo the Editors:<br />\nIn fairness to all prospective<br />\nfreshman who will be deciding, over<br />\nthe next two weeks, whether or not<br />\nto attend Johns Hopkins, I feel<br />\nobligated to comment on the April<br />\n19 editorial \"Spy Before You buy.\"<br />\nThe writer may have attempted objectivity, but what came through was<br />\nthe ever-prevalent Hopkins Inferiority Complex.<br />\nThis love that much of our student<br />\nbody has for whining and harping on<br />\nproblems gets ludicrous after a<br />\nwhile. We have all chosen to attend<br />\nthis school, and while some students<br />\nmay have turned to Hopkins as a second choice, I have trouble believing that many chose to pay the<br />\n$20,000 pricetag as a last resort. I<br />\nfor one had a difficult time choosing between colleges, and I chose<br />\nHopkins as my first choice, not due<br />\nto a lack of alternatives.<br />\nWe at Hopkins are lucky to be surrounded by a beautiful campus in a<br />\ndiverse city. We study under a<br />\nbrilliant faculty, many of whom are<br />\neager to work with undergraduates<br />\nwho take the time to seek them out.<br />\nA large number of activities are constantly available on campus, and as<br />\na founder of Octopodes (a cappella<br />\nsingers), I can vouch for the willingness of a school staff and students<br />\nto support new ideas.(Despite comments about the SAC in the editorial,<br />\nwe exist as a student group<br />\nregardless of not meeting all the<br />\ncriteria of the SAC\u2014the student activities office is quite flexible.) As<br />\nfor living conditions, almost<br />\neveryone I know loved dorm life,<br />\nand required sophomore housing<br />\nmay help build a much-needed sense<br />\nof community. And the opportunity<br />\nafter dorm life to live in the middle<br />\nof Baltimore, in a rowhouse full of<br />\nstudents, is something my friends at<br />\nother colleges envy\u2014we seem to<br />\nhave the best of both worlds, so what<br />\nare we complaining about?<br />\nam not suggesting that Hopkins<br />\nstudents become a bunch of Pollyannas, eternally cheerful, oblivious to<br />\nwhat problems we really do have\u2014<br />\nthis would be dangerous. What I do<br />\nask is that we look at what we have<br />\nhere and then at the image we are<br />\ngiving potential students by<br />\ndownplaying our assets and<br />\nhighlighting negative attitudes.

What you really did<br />\nwas paint a very negative and unfair<br />\npicture of our University. You were<br />\nright in your assessment of Hopkins<br />\nfaculty being top-notch, but otherwise your information was decidedly wrong. The School of Arts and<br />\nSciences and the Whiting'Sth'ool'of<br />\nEngineering together employ 346<br />\nfull time and 428 part time faculty<br />\nmembers. Of those, 99 percent hold<br />\na Ph.D. and 1 percent have their<br />\nMasters. These faculty members<br />\nteach 98 percent of the classes here<br />\nat Hopkins while TA's and outside<br />\nprofessionals teach only a very small<br />\npercentage of classes.<br />\nAs a Blue Key Society member,<br />\nand a tour guide who you say has<br />\nsomething to gain by giving prospective students good or bad reviews,<br />\nI would like to remind you of<br />\nsomething. Blue Key, which<br />\ncelebrated its thirtieth anniversary<br />\nthis year, has always been and still<br />\nis a purely voluntary organization<br />\nrun by Hopkins students. Also, contrary to what you believe, tour<br />\nguides are average students and our<br />\nopinions and experiences aren't any<br />\nless important than any other student's. We know that Hopkins isn't<br />\nperfect and we never portray it to be.<br />\nWe accentuate the positive without<br />\nignoring the negative and give honest<br />\ncommentary about what is right and<br />\nwrong at Hopkins. We give tours to<br />\nprospective students and their<br />\nfamilies because we like our university and because we want their first<br />\nimpression to be a positive one.<br />\nThank God that their first contact<br />\nwith a Hopkins student is with one<br />\nof us and not with you.<br />\nSarah Christiano<br />\nTo the Editors:<br />\nAnuj Gupta did not write the<br />\nAmerican Green about Earth Day<br />\nlast week; I did. As Anuj's name<br />\nwas not printed anywhere on the<br />\noriginal copy, this fabrication<br />\ndisturbs me greatly, especially in<br />\nlight of the recent behavior of the<br />\neditorial staff. Two major mistakes<br />\nthat the News-Letter staff was informed of at least three times have<br />\nstill not been corrected in print. In<br />\nthe American Green ozone article,<br />\nthere is an important typo that reads<br />\n\"These treaties will replenish the<br />\nlost ozone\" when in fact they will<br />\nnot. Typographical errors can be<br />\nforgiven, but immediate correction<br />\nin print as soon as it is informed of<br />\nthe error is the responsibility of any<br />\neven semi-professional publication.<br />\nThe other error was the complete<br />\nrewording of a sentence in the<br />\nScience article on paper and<br />\nstyrofoam, which had the effect of<br />\ncompletely inverting the meaning.<br />\nLaura C.

After<br />\nfour years of intense education at<br />\na renowned private preparatory<br />\nschool, the most intelligent<br />\nremark they could offer in the<br />\nheat of the moment was a \"You<br />\nonly got in because you're<br />\nBlack!\"<br />\nEven today, four years later,<br />\nmy peers continue to demonstrate<br />\nignorance and blind faith in their<br />\nown egos. My reference is to<br />\nDeborah Kanner, one of the<br />\neditors of the National<br />\nEnquirer\u2014! mean Hopkins Spectator \u2014and her recent article \"A<br />\nDouble-Edged Sword,\" which<br />\ndisplays not only a serious lack<br />\nof<br />\nunderstanding<br />\nabout<br />\naffirmative action, but a disregard<br />\nfor journalistic ethics as well.<br />\nLike many other people, Kanner<br />\nerroneously believes that affirmative action is a policy aimed at<br />\nbringing unqualified AfricanAmericans and other culturally<br />\nand linguistically diverse peoples,<br />\ninto universities like Johns<br />\nHopkins. This is bull, plain and<br />\nsimple. The true and valid reason<br />\n<br />\nfor instituting affirmative action<br />\nprograms is that such policies aim<br />\nat bringing qualified AfricanAmericans into this and other<br />\nuniversities. Why? Because<br />\n\"Only the educated are free.\"<br />\nThis is an end which all Blacks<br />\nseek, in one form or another. The<br />\nJohns Hopkins University motto<br />\nis: Veritas vos Liberabit or \"The<br />\nTruth [Education] will set you<br />\nFree.\" It's ironic that a minority<br />\nof the Johns Hopkins population<br />\nis taking it upon themselves to<br />\nchallenge our very rights to gain<br />\nthis key to unlock true freedom.<br />\nThe history of AfricanAmericans is testimony to this<br />\nquest for education and freedom.<br />\nFirst we started in bondage, obviously not free. During this<br />\nperiod, education belonged only<br />\nto free men, white men. Even<br />\nafter the abolition of slavery,<br />\neducation was unavailable to<br />\nblack people. Still today, many<br />\nAfrican-Americans remain<br />\nwithout equitable resources, opportunities, and education.<br />\nTherefore, the black man remains<br />\nunfree.

We are<br />\nlearning more and more that cars<br />\nare a luxury we cannot afford.<br />\nOver the past ten years, more<br />\nAmericans<br />\nhave<br />\nbeen<br />\nkilled in automobile accidents<br />\nthan in both World Wars, the<br />\nKorean War, and the Vietnam<br />\nWar combined. Cars are one of<br />\nthe most noxious polluting<br />\ndevices we have. They are inefficient and dangerous, and better<br />\nmeans of transportation are<br />\nalready available. In fact, as late<br />\nas the 1940s, mass transportation<br />\nwas still the most commonly<br />\nused means of getting around.<br />\nDriving the equivalent of one<br />\ntank of gasoline produces 400<br />\npounds of carbon dioxide, one of<br />\nthe primary greenhouse gasses.<br />\n24 percent of all the carbon<br />\ndioxide produced in the U.S. is<br />\nproduced by car exhaust. Almost<br />\n<br />\nall the parts of a car are toxic or<br />\npolluting. Car batteries contain<br />\nheavy metals and very strong<br />\nacids. Air conditioners contain<br />\nCFCs, the major chemicals<br />\nresponsible for depleting the<br />\nozone in the ozone layer. Wiper<br />\nfluid, antifreeze, transmission<br />\nfluid, and brake fluid are all<br />\ndangerously toxic. And how<br />\nmuch of a car gets recycled or<br />\nreused after it has finished up its<br />\nshockingly short 5 year life span?<br />\nIn the U.S., the average<br />\nmileage of cars is a mere 19 miles<br />\nper gallon, but the average<br />\nmileage of cars in Western<br />\nEurope, Japan and America<br />\ntogether is 30 mpg. Already,<br />\nthere are production-line cars<br />\navailable on the market that get<br />\nmore than 50, and there have<br />\nbeen prototypes built which get<br />\nmore than 120 miles per gallon.<br />\nIf the average mileage of cars<br />\nin America was raised 2.8 miles<br />\nper gallon, we would save more<br />\noil than we used to import annual-<br />\n<br />\nPer Jambeck<br />\nly from Kuwait and Iraq combined. One half of the world's<br />\nconsumption of oil is used in cars.<br />\nWe are only 5 percent of the<br />\nworld's population, but we use 30<br />\npercent of its energy. The U.S.<br />\nuses three times the energy it produces and two-thirds of its oil is<br />\nused by cars.<br />\nWithin a city, there is no excuse for needing a car. In cities,<br />\nwhere cars sit in traffic jams and<br />\nidle at red lights, most cars spend<br />\na lot of their gasoline and energy<br />\ngoing nowhere. This is an incredible waste. If we got cars out<br />\nof our cities, we could make a<br />\nsignificant dent in the smog problem. Currently, in American<br />\ncities, cars produce one-half of all<br />\nnitrous oxides, which form nitric<br />\nacid in the air, two-thirds of all<br />\ncarbon monoxides, which<br />\n<br />\npoisonously replaces oxygen in<br />\nthe blood, and one half of all<br />\nhydrocarbons, which combine<br />\nwith nitrous oxides to produce<br />\nozone. Ozone high in the<br />\nstratosphere protects us from<br />\nultraviolet light, but ozone at<br />\nground level where it can be<br />\nbreathed destroys human lung<br />\ntissue.<br />\nImagine how much of a city<br />\ncould be used for other things,<br />\nsuch as parks, if it didn't have to<br />\nbe used for roads and parking<br />\nlots. Currently, one-half of all urban land area is pavement. In<br />\nL.A., two-thirds of the land area<br />\nis paved over for cars. Over all,<br />\n60,000 square miles of land in the<br />\ncontinental U.S. is paved. That's<br />\n2 percent of the total land area of<br />\nthe continental U.S., about the<br />\nsize of Georgia, or the size of<br />\n<br />\nMaryland, Virginia, Delaware<br />\nand New Jersey combined.<br />\nImagine every one of the MidAtlantic states paved over in<br />\nasphalt and concrete. Bush has<br />\nrecently called for doubling the<br />\nsize of our interstate highway<br />\nsystem, although nothing has<br />\ncome of it yet.<br />\nThe point is that there are better modes of transportation<br />\nalready available. Mass transit is<br />\nfaster and much more efficient.<br />\nIn the space equivalent to one lane<br />\nof highway, a bus lane can carry<br />\nup to 9,000 people per hour, a<br />\nlight rail can carry up to 15,000<br />\npeople per hour, and a heavy rail<br />\ncan carry up to 34,000 people per<br />\nhour. A lane of highway carrying cars can carry only 2,250<br />\npeople per hour, even assuming<br />\nthat the cars are carrying four<br />\n<br />\npeople each. How many people<br />\ndrive alone to work? Travelling<br />\non mass transportation is often<br />\neasier and entails less of a hassle<br />\nthan trying to deal with rush hour<br />\ntraffic.<br />\nTrains are faster, easier, and<br />\nmore available to everyone, particularly handicapped people who<br />\ncan't drive and poor people who<br />\ncan't afford a car. If we<br />\nswitched to mass transit, we<br />\ncould cut emissions of hydrocarbons in our cities by 90 percent,<br />\nof nitrous oxides by 75 percent,<br />\nand of carbon monoxides by 75<br />\npercent.<br />\nThe main point is that the more<br />\npeople who use mass transit, the<br />\nmore efficient it is. Baltimore has<br />\na very good mass transit system<br />\nof buses, and Amtrak goes almost<br />\neverywhere on the East Coast. If<br />\nyou need to go to DC, take the<br />\nMARC train.

Make no mistake,<br />\nwe're not talking heavy artistic or<br />\nmoral statement here.<br />\nBut basking in the post-Persian<br />\nGulf glow, this engaging action<br />\ndrama, starring a cadre of young<br />\nactors, never pretends to be one.<br />\nInstead, Toy Soldiers gives its<br />\nyoung audience exactly what it<br />\nbargains for: a rousing, not too<br />\ncomplex battle between good and<br />\nevil, with all-American delinquents resourcefully banishing<br />\ngreasy foreigners. It's a kind of<br />\nHome Alone for the Stridex set.<br />\nThe film opens with a hostage<br />\ncrisis in Mexico, where Luis Cali<br />\n(Andrew Divoff) has attempted to<br />\nforce the release of his father<br />\nEnrique (Jesse Doran), who is being extradited to the United States<br />\nfor trial on drug charges. When<br />\nit becomes clear that Enrique has<br />\nalready left Mexico, Luis drops<br />\n<br />\nhis hostages\u2014literally, from a<br />\nhelicopter\u2014and moves to the<br />\nUnited States to terrorize there.<br />\nHe lands at the Regis School,<br />\na gorgeous walled estate in<br />\nVirginia, where the son of the<br />\njudge assigned to his father's case<br />\ngoes to school. The boy is<br />\nhustled out under.federal protection, but Luis commandeers the<br />\nschool anyway, since many of the<br />\nother kids have parents influential enough to cause the necessary<br />\nhostage hysteria.<br />\nSo what kind of kids are we<br />\ndealing with at the Regis school?<br />\nFive spoiled, irreverent rejects<br />\nare the heroic focus of Toy<br />\nSoldiers. The students are barely held in check by Dean Edward<br />\nParker (Lou Gossett) and Headmaster Robert Gould (Denholm<br />\nElliott). Ringleader Billy Tepper<br />\n(Sean Astin) sells liquor to his<br />\nclassmates in mouthwash bottles<br />\nwhen he's not hotwiring phone<br />\nsex onto a homemade intercom<br />\nsystem.<br />\nThe terrorists aren't playing<br />\ngames, however, and they set<br />\n<br />\nelaborate traps to insure that none<br />\nof the students make an effort to<br />\nescape or thwart them. But you<br />\ncan't keep a bad kid down, and<br />\neventually the five young boys<br />\nhatch a plan of their own to regain<br />\nthe school.<br />\nBesides Tepper, the four<br />\nclassmates are basically fillers:<br />\nother than Joey Trotta (Wil<br />\nWheaton), the son of a mafia<br />\nleader, these characters aren't<br />\ngiven even one interesting trait.<br />\nPetrie's long sequences between<br />\nthe action are plodding and barely<br />\nkeep our attention, failing to complicate the characters in any way<br />\nthat might have separated this<br />\nfilm from the rest of the brat pack<br />\nflicks.<br />\nAs Tepper, Astin shines in the<br />\nlater sequences of the film as he<br />\nconfronts and confounds the terrorists. But he's a little too wise<br />\nto be playing such a wisecracker,<br />\nand even worse, he seems to<br />\nknow it. The character seems to<br />\nbore him, and Astin's the one actor in Toy Soldiers who seems<br />\nready for bigger and better things.<br />\n<br />\nIn the role of Joey Trotta,<br />\nWheaton has the part with the<br />\nmost potential. But he slips in and<br />\nout of his New York accent with<br />\nembarassing ease, and looks so<br />\nweak physically that his apparent<br />\nmental strength and ill-fated<br />\nresistance are laughable.<br />\nObviously, Regis doesn't house<br />\nthe world's junior rocket scientists, but we have to believe that<br />\nsomething beyond a mere survival instinct inspires their actions. Regrettably, no evidence is<br />\never given. We care whether the<br />\nyoungsters live or die only<br />\nbecause they are youngsters, and<br />\nroot them on for the same cheap<br />\nreason.<br />\nWriter/director Petrie sets up<br />\nthe plot points explicitly, but fails<br />\nto move between them with any<br />\nfinesse or director's sense of tension. He merely-ticks them off as<br />\npart of an overall mission accomplished. Somewhere along<br />\nthe line, however, he seems to<br />\nhave forgotten what the mission<br />\nwas.<br />\nThere's a perverse kind of glee<br />\n<br />\nA hardy band of rebellious teens play Home Alone with international<br />\nterrorist baddies in Toy Soldiers.<br />\nin the pranks of Tepper and his the tone is far too grim overall.<br />\nbuddies, and as predictable as the In separating this \"good\" film<br />\nemotions the film generates may from any number of \"great\"<br />\nbe, there is no denying their films, one realizes how far apart<br />\nexistence.

(For a complete<br />\ntranscript, send two dollars to my<br />\ncampus mailbox).<br />\n<br />\nin the world, but it's not as easy<br />\nas it looks, either. In this farewell<br />\nessay, I'd like to explain myself,<br />\nif possible. I'm not making excuses, mind you\u2014and I still hate<br />\nHome Alone\u2014but what ends up<br />\non the page in a review isn't<br />\nalways the whole story. Not to be<br />\npretentious, but there's a whole<br />\nphilosophy behind writing film<br />\nreviews, and as the final bell tolls<br />\nI think I've finally figured mine<br />\nout<br />\nThe aura of star power is<br />\nsomething tough to overcome.<br />\nThe first film I reviewed in<br />\nSeptember 1989 was Sea ofLove.<br />\nAs I left the theater, I had a vague<br />\nsense of discomfort. I didn't particularly like the film, but why?<br />\nAnd who was I to criticize Al<br />\nPacino for looking too old?<br />\n<br />\nThe perfect film is one that mirrors<br />\nlife, teaches about it, or even<br />\ntransforms it. Film can do that if it's<br />\ndone with care.<br />\nBy comparison, in 1990, Roger<br />\nEbert gave the thumbs-up to 64<br />\npercent of the movies he<br />\nreviewed. At the other end of the<br />\nscale, Hal Hinson of The<br />\nWashington Post praised only 34<br />\npercent. So that places me<br />\nsomewhere down towards the bitter and resentful end of the critical<br />\nequation. Call me the Butcher of<br />\nBaltimore.<br />\nBut!don't consider myself Mr.<br />\nNegative Critic. I love movies. I<br />\nwouldn't spend hours each week<br />\nat the theater and in front of the<br />\nVCR if I didn't. And I certainly<br />\nwouldn't be leaving Hopkins next<br />\nmonth to go spend three years and<br />\na lot of money in film school.<br />\nSure, it's not the toughest job<br />\n<br />\nIt took about a week to get over<br />\nit. After that, buoyed by the<br />\nnegative notices the film received from many critics(Hinson<br />\nliked it, by the way), I plunged<br />\nright ahead. Go with what you<br />\nknow, read as many other<br />\nreviews as you can after you've<br />\nwritten yours, and act like you<br />\nknow what you're talking about.<br />\nIt worked wonders. Suddenly, I<br />\nthought, I do know what I'm talking about.<br />\nWhat makes a movie good or<br />\nbad? In my opinion, a great director with all the visual tricks in the<br />\nworld cannot salvage a bad<br />\nscreenplay. I'll take the<br />\nstoryteller (Spielberg) over the<br />\nstylist(Stone) any day. It's more<br />\n<br />\nimportant that the characters have<br />\ndepth than that the director<br />\nthought it was a brilliant idea to<br />\nattach the camera to a character's<br />\ngenitals during a lovemaking<br />\nscene.<br />\nOn the other hand, a sitcom<br />\ndirector can do no wrong with a<br />\nfairy tale about a make-good<br />\nhooker, who happens to be<br />\nplayed by the hottest young actress in Hollywood. I could have<br />\ndirected Pretty Woman; a blind<br />\nman could have directed it.<br />\nThere's plenty of sufficiently<br />\ntalented directors out there<br />\nwaiting for a modestly competent<br />\nscript and a little casting luck to<br />\nmake them look good.<br />\nHow often do the two\u2014quality<br />\ndirection and quality writing\u2014<br />\ncome together? I have no idea. I<br />\ndon't know much about directing,<br />\neven less about acting, except<br />\nwhat I've learned on this job. My<br />\nbackground is in writing, and it<br />\nqualifies me to write film reviews<br />\nbecause writing happens to be the<br />\nmost important part. If a line of<br />\ndialogue sounds natural, anyone<br />\ncan say it or film it. A great<br />\nmovie can't exist without a great<br />\nscript.<br />\nThe biggest beef I hear from<br />\npeople who disagree with my<br />\nreviews is that they go to the<br />\nmovies for enjoyment. The implication, of course, is that I<br />\ndon't. They envision me sitting<br />\nin a dark theater, grimly shaking<br />\nmy head and jotting down this<br />\nand that, harpooning the more<br />\ntalented and successful if I can<br />\nthink of a witty phrase to match.<br />\nIn a way, they're right. I expect a certain amount of intelligence in a film. I expect that<br />\nmy ever-increasing ticket investment be taken seriously. Every<br />\nfilm begins with promise: the<br />\nchance that it may be the perfect<br />\nfilm, the one that mirrors life,<br />\nteaches about it, or even<br />\ntransforms it. Film can do that if<br />\n<br />\nFilm reviewer Mark Friedman awakens to find his ultimate nightmare, that of transforming into Macaulay<br />\nCulkin, has come true.<br />\n<br />\nby Paul Kramer<br />\nMy grandmother picks up the<br />\nNews-Letter some weeks and<br />\nsays, \"It's nice, but you didn't do<br />\nanything this issue.\"<br />\nThat's what it's like to be an<br />\neditor.<br />\nI try to explain to her the<br />\nartistic subtleties of my layout. I<br />\nsay to her, \"Grandma, if you<br />\ndon't see it, then that means I did<br />\nit.\"<br />\nThis sounds like Zen to Grandma.

You other NewsLetter folks know what I'm talking about.<br />\nYou sit at the typesetter for<br />\nhours giggling and dreaming up<br />\nheadlines you'll never run<br />\n(Needle will run them).<br />\nYour writers get on you<br />\nbecause you say that, as editor,<br />\nyou might need to edit them.

I'll skewer whoever<br />\nthe hell I want if they renege on<br />\nthe promise built into the filmgoing experience, and you should<br />\ntoo. These people get paid far too<br />\nmuch money to be \"enjoyed\"<br />\nwithout question. Make them<br />\nwork harder. Hate some of them.<br />\nDon't go to others.

Observed nationwide also<br />\nas National Victim's Week, this<br />\nevent serves, as expressed by<br />\nMarilyn Gall, R.N., of the Student Health Clinic, \"to do exactly<br />\nas it says, help people recognize<br />\nthat it can happen, and that they<br />\nmust remain aware so that they<br />\ncan react to a possibly dangerous<br />\nsituation before they find<br />\nthemselves trapped in it.\"<br />\nGall explained that Rape<br />\nAwareness Week is highlighted<br />\nby the Student Health Clinic as<br />\nare all events dedicated to raising<br />\nawareness on serious health<br />\nissues, such as National Condom<br />\nWeek. Although the Rape Crisis<br />\nCenter is more active in promoting rape awareness and<br />\ntreating victims, Gall says that the<br />\nclinic often learns of cases of rape<br />\nweeks, months, or even years<br />\nafter the fact. Students come in<br />\nfor other health concerns, and the<br />\nclinic is able to help him or her<br />\nin finding a treatment facility.<br />\nThe Health Clinic also provides<br />\nfree screenings to students concerned about the possibility of<br />\npregnancy or contraction of sexually transmitted disease.<br />\nGall emphasized that, especially on college campuses, issues of<br />\nsexual assault go beyond simple<br />\nviolence.<br />\n\"It's often the subtleties of<br />\ngender relations and sexual<br />\nassault that pose problems in<br />\ncommunities such as this,\" she<br />\nsaid. \"People don't recognize<br />\ntheir vulnerabilities in groups.<br />\nWhen alcohol is involved and<br />\ncertain individuals act on<br />\nmisinterpretations of sexual relationships, one or the other often<br />\nfinds themselves being forced<br />\ninto having a sexual experience<br />\nthey didn't want.\"<br />\nSharon Reynold, Assistant<br />\nDirector of Residential Life and<br />\na Medical Advocate at the Sexual Assault Recovery Center<br />\n(SARC) explains that the weeklong event is organized nationally by various social action<br />\ncoalitions.<br />\nIn Maryland and Baltimore, the<br />\nGovernor and Mayor respectively<br />\nhave issued official proclamations<br />\nof Rape Awareness Week, and<br />\nthe media has focused on<br />\nstatistics, awareness, and community efforts to bring down the<br />\nnumber of victims. Recent<br />\nstatistics in the Baltimore Sun<br />\nindicate that in 1990, 21,084<br />\nrapes were reported in Maryland,<br />\na 23 percent increase from 1989.<br />\nFurther studies suggest that these<br />\nreported rapes account for only<br />\napproximately 10 percent of the<br />\nactual total.<br />\nMs. Reynolds cited various<br />\nSARC-sponsored workshops and<br />\ninformation sessions aimed at<br />\n<br />\npromoting general awareness and<br />\ncommunication between the sexes<br />\nas examples of community<br />\nactivities during the week, and<br />\nencouraged all interested individuals to attend the \"Take<br />\nBack the Night\" Rally to be held<br />\ntonight, April 26th, at 6:30 p.m.<br />\nat Rash Field .near the Inner<br />\nHarbor.<br />\n\"It's purpose is to help get the<br />\nnight back for people to be safe,\"<br />\nshe explained. \"It hopes to raise<br />\nawareness on safety issues and<br />\nrape prevention, and should be<br />\nattended by several speakers on<br />\nviolence toward women.\"<br />\n<br />\nReynolds has taken an active<br />\nrole herself in promoting rape<br />\nawareness, speaking earlier this<br />\nweek at a Brown Bag Luch Series<br />\nLecture on issues of safety and<br />\nprevention.<br />\n\"I think the biggest problem is<br />\nthat people just aren't prepared,\"<br />\nshe says. \"We need to be aware<br />\nof our surroundings all the time,<br />\n<br />\nand have a game plan in case of<br />\nemergency.\"<br />\nBoth Gall and Reynolds agree<br />\nthat if Rape Awareness Week<br />\nserves its purpose, it will help<br />\nbring about an overall awareness<br />\nand commitment to precaution by<br />\nall members of the community.<br />\n\"Everybody is at risk all the<br />\ntime,\" concluded Gall. \"It's important to think in advance<br />\nbecause when a situation arises<br />\nour reaction time is always<br />\nslowed. It may be that bit of extra planning that helps us carry<br />\nthrough when the time comes.\"<br />\nSome safety tips noted by Gall<br />\nand Reynolds include:<br />\n\u2014take account of your surroundings and devise a game plan<br />\nin advance<br />\n\u2014when walking to your car,<br />\nhave your keys in hand and check<br />\nunderneath the car before approaching to unlock the door<br />\n\u2014travel in groups after dark<br />\nand in risky areas: even traveling<br />\nin two's is often not enough<br />\n\u2014know the individuals well<br />\nwith whom you put yourself in<br />\npotentially dangerous situations<br />\n\u2014\"yes\" means yes and \"no\"<br />\nmeans no<br />\nSARC's twenty-four hour<br />\nhotline is 366-RAPE, and the<br />\nHealth Clinic or its answering<br />\nservice can also be contacted at<br />\nany hour for assistance at<br />\n338-8270.<br />\n<br />\nSexual Assault Recovery<br />\nCenter Program<br />\n<br />\nLet me take you down,cause<br />\nCamden Fields, soon to be real.<br />\n<br />\nO's on the Move<br />\nBaltimore Building New Ballpark<br />\nby Steve Rhim<br />\nBaltimore's new downtown<br />\nCamden Yards ballpark will open<br />\nin 1992 in what the Maryland<br />\nStadium Authority calls a true<br />\n\"Opening Day.\" The stadium, a<br />\n105.4 million dollar project, will<br />\nreplace Memorial Stadium as<br />\nhome to the Orioles. Although<br />\nmost people support the building<br />\nof the new stadium, there are<br />\nthose who are not sure that the<br />\nconstruction is necessary.<br />\nMemorial Stadium will still<br />\nhold more seats than the<br />\ndowntown park.

The new facilities<br />\ninclude skyboxes, handicapped<br />\nseating, club level seating, private<br />\nand party suites, and bleacher and<br />\ngeneral admissions seating. The<br />\nconstruction of Memorial<br />\nStadium had not permitted such<br />\nfeatures at a reasonable cost.<br />\nThe popularity of the new<br />\nCamden Yards stadium has contributed to Baltimore's selection<br />\nas the site of the 1993 Major<br />\nLeague All-Star Game. It is<br />\nestimated that such an event will<br />\nbring more than 50 million dollar<br />\nin economic benefits to the area<br />\n<br />\n0100.40041.1..ibs.T<br />\n<br />\nApril 26:<br />\n9:00 a.m.\u2014Health Fair at Franklin Square<br />\nHospital<br />\n<br />\nApril 30; May 1, May 2, May 6, May 7:<br />\nPhone-A-Thon\u2014Sexual Assault Recovery Center<br />\npresents a five-night telethon beginning on April<br />\n30 on Channel 2.<br />\n<br />\ndiminish the amount of traffic<br />\nentering the downtown area. By<br />\nhaving the stadium downtown,<br />\ntraffic leaving the Inner Harbor<br />\narea will also be diminished. It is<br />\nexpected that residents of<br />\ndowntown Baltimore will walk to<br />\nthe ballpark.<br />\nThe Light Rail System, in<br />\naddition to improvements in the<br />\nMARC commuter service and the<br />\nMTA bus service, will expand the<br />\nInner Harbor area commercially<br />\nand demographically. It iq<br />\nestimated that the stadium will<br />\n<br />\npeople, while the new stadium<br />\nwill hold only 47,000. The<br />\nYards stadium,<br />\nCamden<br />\nhowever, will have no obstructed<br />\nview seating.<br />\nParking facilities will also be<br />\nimproved. Moving from<br />\nMemorial Stadium to Camden<br />\nYards is expected to lessen traffic problems in the city. The site<br />\nhas 5,000 parking spaces;<br />\nhowever, 20,000 more are<br />\navailable in the downtown area.<br />\nResidents of north Baltimore,<br />\nTowson, and the Cockeysville<br />\narea will be able to take the<br />\nplanned Light Rail System to the<br />\nstadium. The rail system will<br />\n<br />\ngenerate 1.1 billion dollars in<br />\nrevenues for the city. The new<br />\nstadium will definitely impact the<br />\ncity's economy in a positive way<br />\nsince no tax-payer dollars are being used in construction. Funding<br />\nfor the stadium comes solely from<br />\nthe sales of revenue bonds.<br />\nMaryland citizens support the<br />\nproject only through the purchase<br />\nof instant lotteries dedicated to the<br />\nMaryland Stadium Authority, or<br />\nby attending a game at the new<br />\nballpark. Returns from the<br />\nstadium investment will contribute to the funding of hospitals,<br />\nhomeless shelters, educational<br />\nenhancements and welfare<br />\nassistance.<br />\nAnother important reason for<br />\nthe construction of the Camden<br />\nYards park is the preservation of<br />\nthe Orioles as a Baltimore based<br />\nteam. The new stadium assures<br />\nthat the Orioles will remain in<br />\nMaryland for at least fifteen more<br />\nyears. The variety in seating<br />\narrangements will ensure that<br />\n<br />\nLIOW<br />\n<br />\nPOPCC<br />\n<br />\nin a single week.<br />\nEven with the construction of<br />\nthe new ballpark, old Memorial<br />\nStadium will not lose its importance. Once the Camden Yards<br />\npark is completed, arrangements<br />\nwill be made to give Baltimore a<br />\nprofessional football team.<br />\nMemorial Stadium will be used<br />\nas a provisional stadium for the<br />\nfootball team. There are future<br />\nplans to eventually build a football stadium next to Camden<br />\nYards baseball park. It is hoped<br />\nthat these new developments will<br />\nbring both status and economic<br />\nbenefits to the city and the state.<br />\n<br />\nOrchestrating the HSO<br />\nby Elizabeth Lipnick<br />\n<br />\nViolins, violence, silence...<br />\nThe BMA ain't the only one around here with culture.<br />\n<br />\nLoren Reith<br />\n<br />\nThe Hopkins Symphony Orchestra(HSO)has been alive and<br />\nkicking for 70 years, but it first<br />\nattracted attention in the early<br />\n1980s when a Peabody graduate<br />\nstudent, Catherine Overhauser,<br />\nexpanded the orchestra's mission.<br />\nThe HSO is a community<br />\norchestra comprised of approximately 70 musicians from the<br />\nBaltimore community, as well as<br />\nHopkins students, faculty and<br />\nstaff.

But those reports were apparently based on tests with contaminated material. What I found<br />\nwith the purified left-handed<br />\nsugar was that it tasted the same<br />\nas right-handed sugar.\"<br />\nHowever, do not expect to see<br />\nLev-0-Cal in your diet soda<br />\ntomorrow. Biospherics has a few<br />\nproblems to work out before Lev0-Cal can be put into daily use.<br />\nFor one, Lev-0-Cal is still quite<br />\nexpensive to make. Regular<br />\nsugar, and even Nutra-Sweet,<br />\ncost about thirty-three cents a<br />\npound to make. Lev-0-Cal costs<br />\nabout one hundred dollars a<br />\npound. Why such a high price?<br />\nThe production of Lev-0-Cal requires only inexpensive raw<br />\nmaterials. The process, however,<br />\nrequires a long and complicated<br />\nseries of chemical and enzymatic<br />\nmodifications, and product is lost<br />\nwith each step. Dr. Lee Zehner,<br />\nthe research director at<br />\nBiospherics, expects nonetheless<br />\nthat the price can and will be<br />\nbrought down: \"If we can improve the efficiency and yield of<br />\nthe processes, that's money in the<br />\nbank.\"<br />\nEven with a lower cost of production, Lev-0-Cal may still be<br />\na long way from the stores.<br />\n<br />\nBiospherics must get FDA approval for Lev-O-Cal before it<br />\ncan be marketed. Other artificial<br />\nsweetners have encountered problems in this area, sometimes(as<br />\nin the case of saccharin) getting<br />\napproval and later being implicated as a carcinogen. Zehner<br />\ndoes not anticipate problems like<br />\nthese. Although Lev-O-Cal cannot be broken down into the<br />\nbody, there is no data suggesting<br />\nadverse effects. Three years of<br />\nlaboratory tests in animals have<br />\nshown no side effects from Lev0-Cal. \"If it went into fatty<br />\ndeposits or became attached to a<br />\nprotein, then you'd have a problem. But it's eliminated so<br />\nquickly\u2014ninety-nine percent<br />\nwithin forty-eight hours.\"<br />\nThe missing one percent, Dr.<br />\nZehner believes, is lost to experimental error\u2014\"as with any<br />\nexperiment, you have that one or<br />\ntwo percent that gets away from<br />\nyou.\" Still, the researches at<br />\nBiospherics will perform more<br />\nextensive tests for the FDA, using multiple doses daily over a<br />\ntwo-week period to assure that<br />\nthe unmetabolized sugar does not<br />\naccumulate and pose a health<br />\nrisk. If the FDA does approve the<br />\nuse of Lev-O-Cal, it may be in<br />\nstores in the form of low-calorie<br />\ncakes, pasteries, candy, etc., by<br />\n1995, providing an appealing<br />\nalternative to sugar.

The Terpsjumped ahead to<br />\na 3-1 lead before the Jays called<br />\ntime-out. That seemed to work as<br />\nHopkins scored once more in the<br />\nfirst, on a ten yarder from Seth<br />\nTierney, and then tied the game<br />\nto start the second quarter when<br />\nVecchione scored his second, off<br />\nanother faceoff.<br />\nThat's when Maryland took<br />\nover.

The<br />\nTerps used length-of-the-field<br />\n<br />\npassing to break the Hopkins ten 1<br />\nman ride and to generate several<br />\nempty net opportunities.

With<br />\nHopkins' goalie Scott Giardina<br />\ncoming out of the net to cover a<br />\nMaryland attacker, the Terps<br />\ntook several long range shots.<br />\nAlthough none of them scored,<br />\nthey forced Giardina to play<br />\ncloser to the goal than he would<br />\nhave liked.<br />\nInjuries didn't help the Jays any<br />\nthis week either. Thirteen goal<br />\nscorer Adam Wright was sitting<br />\nout the game with a separated<br />\nshoulder. Second line midfielder<br />\nCharlie Speno also watched the<br />\ngame from the sidelines. Seth<br />\nTierney played, but with an injured wrist. The two injuries<br />\nforced the Jays to shuffle their<br />\nnormal midfield lines by replacing Wright with Scott Mollica and<br />\nSpeno with Alex Wadkovsky.<br />\nThe Jays, though hurt in transition, generally played solid<br />\ndefense in settled situations. Nick<br />\nShevillo had a particularly strong<br />\ngame covering Wurzburger in<br />\nman-to-man coverage. Considering Hopkins does not have a real<br />\n\"take-away\" defenseman, they<br />\ndid a good job of getting the ball<br />\n<br />\non the ground.

The ground balls<br />\nand effective clearing, combined<br />\nwith some poor shooting by the<br />\nJays, had Maryland in a great<br />\nposition as they went into the<br />\nlocker room. When they came<br />\nout, they shut the Jays out for the<br />\nthird quarter while scoring three<br />\ntimes themselves.

Of course, these are the<br />\nsame officials who saw<br />\nWurzburger slash Brian Lukacz<br />\nso badly that Wurzburger spent<br />\n<br />\nthe next two minutes trying to<br />\nbend his stick back, and didn't<br />\nmake a call. At least the Terps<br />\nfailed to score on the extended<br />\nman-up, but the three minutes<br />\nthat ran off the clock were just as<br />\nsignificant to the stalling<br />\nMaryland squad.<br />\nWith 10:07 remaining in the<br />\ngame, Wills scored on a jumper<br />\nto cut the deficit to 10-5.<br />\nHowever, when the Jays threw<br />\naway another good scoring opportunity, it looked like another<br />\ncase of too little too late. Todd<br />\nCavallaro received a pass from<br />\nbehind, after a deflected shot, and<br />\nscored with 6:43 left, giving the<br />\nJays hope. But when Maryland<br />\nwon the following faceoff, they<br />\nwent back to stalling.<br />\nAs if they hadn't been gambling enough with a full field ride,<br />\nthe Jays were forced to try to double team with Giardina whenever<br />\nthey could.

They will have to<br />\nchallenge Georgetown, which is<br />\nperennially strong in the men's<br />\neight division, as well as equally<br />\ncompetitive boats from Ithaca,<br />\nthe Coast Guard Academy, and<br />\nTufts. If they can continue to improve and stay healthy, the men's<br />\nheavyweight four should also do<br />\nwell at the Dad Vails. The men's<br />\nand women's novice eights may<br />\nbe the boats to most likely benefit<br />\nfrom competing at the Dad Vails,<br />\ngaining much needed experience<br />\nfor next year.<br />\nThe fact that Hopkins has a<br />\nnumber of boats actually vying<br />\nfor honors at the prestigious Dad<br />\nVails speaks volumes about the<br />\nkind of improvement the crews<br />\nhave achieved.

Although his appointment<br />\nis not yet official, Michael<br />\nMcCormick is in the process of<br />\njoining the faculty at Harvard<br />\nUnversity.<br />\nHarvard's offer to McCormick, a Byzantinist, was an<br />\nacademic opportunity that<br />\nHopkins probably could not have<br />\nmatched. According to McCormick, the \"opportunity for<br />\nmedieval studies may be greater<br />\nat [Harvard] than [Hopkins].\"<br />\nDepartment Chair Richard<br />\nGoldthwaite speculated that Harvard's resources, including its<br />\nenormous library and the \"larger<br />\nscholarly community in his<br />\nfield...might make the place<br />\nmuch more appealing.\"<br />\nGreene, a specialist in<br /><br />\nAmerican colonial history, said<br />\nthat there were' no powerful push<br />\nfactors\" involved in his decision<br />\nto leave Hopkins, although there<br />\n\"were some pull factors.\"<br />\nGreene cited his desire to live in<br />\nSouthern California as one of<br />\nthese.<br />\nAccording to Freehling, \"the<br />\nposition I was offered [at SUNYBuffalo] was so much better in<br />\nevery way\" that it was far<br />\nsuperior to anything Hopkins<br />\nhads to offer. Freehling, who is<br />\npopular among undergraduates,<br />\nwas offered the John Lockwood<br />\nendowed chair, a $25,000<br />\nresearch grant, a half-time<br />\nsecretary, and a salary estimated<br />\nat twice that he had at Hopkins.<br />\nIn the absence of a counter offer by Hopkins, Freehling said he<br />\naccepted. He added that \"no real<br />\neffort was made\" on the part of<br />\nthe University, and noted the two<br />\npositions currently vacant in the<br />\nhistory department.<br />\nGreene said the University<br />\n\"could have acted long before the<br />\noffer materialized\" to keep<br />\nFreehling. He added that younger<br />\nprofessors like Freehling have<br />\nbeen \"enormously underpaid\"<br />\nand were \"not quite treated as<br />\nwell as older professors.\"<br />\nAccording to Goldthwaite, a<br />\ndepartment as exceptional as<br />\nHopkins' continually finds its<br />\nfaculty receiving job offers. \"It's<br />\na fact of the academic market,\"<br /><br />\nhe said. \"You have a good faculty so other universities are going<br />\nto want them.<br />\n\"We try to resist these offers,<br />\nbut we're not always successful,\"<br />\nhe said.<br />\nMcCormick agreed that it is a<br />\n\"normal situation [for] distinguished departments [to receive]<br />\noffers every year.\" He felt,<br />\nhowever, that there should be<br />\n\"concern when offers begin to be<br />\naccepted.\"<br />\nThe loss of Greene and Freehling, a specialist in Antebellum<br />\nU.S. history, has hurt\u2014some<br />\nwould say crippled\u2014the department's American history program<br />\nat Hopkins. Goldthwaite said he<br />\nhas not yet talked with Dean of<br />\nArts and Sciences Lloyd Armstrong, but \"assumes that [the<br />\ndepartment] will be able to recruit<br />\npeople.\"<br />\nHe said that Daniel Walkowitz,<br />\na full professor at New York<br />\nUniversity, Will be a visiting<br />\nscholar next year. He added that<br />\n\"there is a possibility [that the<br />\ndepartment] may get some temporary teaching assistants.\"<br /><br />\nAccording to Freehling,<br />\nhowever, \"bringing in a visiting<br />\nprofessor cannot change\" the<br />\nenormous hole left in American<br />\nhistory.<br />\nGoldthwaite said that the size<br />\nof Hopkins places limitations on<br />\nhis department that it must contend with when competing with<br />\nlarger peer departments. Because<br />\nof financial constraints, he said<br />\nhis department attempts to<br />\n\"create a more congenial environment for scholars to work<br />\nin\" with \"the kind of program [it<br />\nhas].\"<br />\nAccording to Greene, though,<br />\nthere are growing concerns<br />\namong faculty, and notjust within<br />\nthe history department, that the<br />\nunique character of Hopkins is in<br />\njeopardy. He said professors are<br />\nconcerned that the size of the<br />\nundergraduate body has grown<br />\ntoo fast, and also feel that the<br />\n\"deans may be behaving in a way<br />\nthat is changing the nature of[the<br />\nUniversity] that will change the<br />\nnature of graduate study.<br />\n\"There is a fear that Hopkins<br />\nContinued on page 2<br /><br />\nBoard Names Kim As<br />\nNew Young Trustee<br />\nby Alex Varon<br />\n\"I see my responsibility as<br />\nmaking the board more aware of<br />\nthe issues which now face the<br />\nUniversity,\" said Suzy Kim.<br />\nKim, who was named the new<br />\nYoung Trustee by the Board of<br />\nTrustees on Monday, said that<br />\nshe is unsure of what, precisely,<br />\nher new responsibilities will be.<br />\n\"Once I learn how things are<br />\ndone, I might have a better idea.<br />\nRight now, what most concerns<br />\nme are the HRCD policy for<br />\ninstitutional change and the faculty advising program for<br />\nstudents.\"<br />\nShe also listed other issues<br />\nwhich she feels are important,<br />\namong them, the question of<br />\ngovernment funding and indirect<br />\ncosts and the opportunity for a<br />\nbroader range of courses to be offered due to faculty turnover.<br />\n\"I think Hopkins is becoming<br />\nmore popular\u2014which is interesting to know, considering<br />\nthat the college applicant pool is<br />\nshrinking. This could be tied to<br />\nthe new renovations, such as<br />\nWolman, but I think we are<br />\nbeginning to see student life<br />\nbecoming a major priority.

This year, that<br />\nnumber had grown to twelve.\"<br />\nKim noted that the competition<br />\nthis year was very strong.<br />\n\"The five finalists were a very<br />\nstrong group of candidates,\" she<br />\nsaid. \"I think the board was looking for someone who was active<br />\nand had been involved with different departments of the University.

The applicant pool was very qualified,\"<br />\nAssociate Dean of Arts and<br />\nSciences Jacquelyn Mitchell said.<br />\nAccording to Mitchell, approximately 50 graduate students applied for the fellowships. Each of<br />\nthem had to receive nominations<br />\nfrom their respective department<br />\nchairs, submit information about<br />\ntheir teaching ability, have letters<br />\nof recommendation, and give<br />\ndescriptions of the relevance of<br />\ntheir proposed course.<br />\n\"I'd say 99 percent of the applicants submitted syllabuses [sic]<br /><br />\nfor me to review along with their<br />\napplications,\" Mitchell said.<br />\n\"On a few, the professors wrote<br />\nthe syllabus, but I rejected those<br />\noutright.\"<br />\nOf the eighteen courses to be<br />\ntaught by graduate students, three<br />\nare in the Department of History<br />\nand four are from the Department<br />\nof Political Science.

Following her defense, she left the<br />\nmeeting.<br />\nAlso attending were numerous<br />\nactive black students from<br />\nHopkins, who expressed great<br />\ndiscontent with the content and<br />\nimport of her work, as well as the<br />\nlack of tact displayed by the Spectator in publishing such a piece.<br />\nJay Lee, who presides on the<br />\nexecutive board for the NAACP,<br />\nbelieved that there was \"a great<br />\ndeal wrong with the article.\"<br />\nAlthough it initially addresses<br />\nminorities in general, it progressively focuses upon the black<br />\npopulace, rather than maintaining<br />\na more broad perspective, he<br />\nsaid.<br />\nHe also cited various incorrect<br />\ndata that Kanner uses in supporting her beliefs, including her<br />\nassertion that the admissions office adds 200 points to the scores<br />\nof black applicants to Hopkins.<br />\nJay asked \"that the 1991-1992<br />\nJHU Student Council examine<br />\nthis issue being unfounded and a<br /><br />\nculturally biased opinion concerning admission of black students.\"<br />\nJerome Ponder, another concerned black student wondered<br />\nwhether the Spectator was subject<br />\nto any journalist ethics.<br />\nCouncil President Bob Nelson<br />\nsaid that there is a protective umbrella for all SAC groups, enabling them to slander other groups,<br />\nan action to which the affected<br />\ngroup cannot rebut. However, the<br />\nSpectator is not an SAC group<br />\nand thus does not fall under this<br />\nblanket, he said.<br />\nNelson added that the only individuals who could take any action would be Deans Boswell or<br />\nColumbo; Council could make<br />\nsuggestions, he said, but is otherwise unable to assume further<br />\nresponsibility.<br />\nRoberta Anisti asked \"why an<br />\ninstitution of the caliber of Johns<br />\nHopkins [would] accept inept<br />\nstudents, such as blacks, as the<br />\narticle implicates?\"<br />\nRepresenting Kanner and the<br />\nSpectator, Editor Lab Roberts addressed some of the questions and<br />\nconcerns presented. To the accusation that Kanner's facts were<br />\nunfounded, Roberts cited the<br />\nsources from which these<br />\nnumbers were taken. He said that<br />\nthe Academic Subcommittee of<br />\nthe Homewood Schools Services<br />\nAdvisory Committee stated that<br />\ndue to the lower SAT scores<br />\nachieved by blacks, 200 points<br />\nare added.<br />\nHe said that the Spectator attempts to follow all journalistic<br />\nethics displayed by all major<br />\nmagazines, and offered that<br /><br />\nDoreen Patron<br />\nJunior Class Representative Paz Haynes takes issue with Deborah<br />\nKanner's Spectator article at Student Council.<br /><br />\n\"anyone who supports different<br />\nopinions than Kanner should submit their views and they [The<br />\nSpectator] will print it up.\"<br />\nJerome Ponder took that opportunity to submit an article.<br />\nAdditional students expressed<br />\ndiscontent and offered data to<br />\ncontradict Kanner's. Roberts<br />\nfielded questions and clarified<br />\nconfusion. He continued to stress<br />\nthat students should submit their<br />\nopinions, as the magazine serves<br />\nas a vehicle for debate.<br />\nHe also said that the meeting<br />\nhad taken on a persecutive atmosphere. Senior class representative Jeff Perlstein said that the<br />\nmeeting was not meant to be a<br />\nprosecution since no action has<br />\nbeen proposed.<br />\nJunior class representative, Paz<br />\nHaynes, closed discussion by requesting that the article as well as<br />\nthe minutes for the meeting of<br />\nApril 23 be distributed to all<br />\ncouncil officers and to Kanner.<br /><br />\nGrad Fellowships Awarded<br />\nNot Way of Offering Courses Cheap<br />\nContinued from page 1<br />\na major deciding factor.<br />\nlooked for timely issues.<br />\nFor example, one student will be<br />\nteaching a course dealing with<br />\nChinese politics and this student<br />\nwas actually there recently,\"<br />\nMitchell said<br />\n\"What ex 'ences the student<br />\ncan bring in was important. . .I<br />\nalso looked for courses not currently offered at Hopkins. For example, there will be a class dealing with contemporary African<br />\nliterature, and the student who<br />\nwill run it lived in South Africa.\"<br />\nAlthough there are critics of the<br />\nplan to have graduates teach<br />\nundergraduates, Mitchell is confident that the program, although<br />\nan \"experiment\" of sorts next<br />\nyear, will do well.<br />\n\"I don't think you have to have<br />\na Ph.D to be the best teacher<br />\nhere,\" Mitchell said. \"Many of<br />\nthe students are actually experts<br />\nin their fields. A few of their<br />\nmentors are even going to actually take their course to learn.\"<br />\nRichard Macksey, a Department of Humanities professor<br />\nwho will serve as a mentor for<br />\nShaun Warn, agrees that students<br />\ncan have expertise in particular<br />\nfields, even over and above that<br />\nof their mentors.<br />\n\"We've always had exceptional graduate students teach<br />\ncourses. This isn't really that new<br />\nan idea,\" Macksey said. \"The<br />\nrecompense and attention is new<br />\nthough. . A think it's a good idea<br />\neven if the cynics think that this<br />\nis just a way of offering courses<br />\ncheap.\"<br />\nFor those who are critical of<br />\nthe whole program, Mitchell says<br /><br />\nthat the system has its own<br />\n\"checks and balances\" of sorts,<br />\nas well as a new support system.<br />\n\"Each student will have the<br />\nguidance of a mentor, as far as<br />\npedagogical methods,\" Mitchell<br />\nsaid. \"Before I accepted any of<br />\nthe students, they had to negotiate<br />\na contract with their mentors that<br />\nensured that the mentor would be<br />\ncommitted to them.\"<br />\nMitchell is also creating a<br />\nDean's Teaching Fellows<br />\nSeminar, which will be an informal \"get-together\" of the student<br />\nteachers twice a month so that<br />\nthey can share problems and concerns about their teaching<br />\nexperiences.<br />\nThe courses that the student<br />\nteachers will be allowed to teach<br />\nare all seminar-like, very intimate<br />\nwith a twenty-five student limit.<br />\n\"This will protect the graduate<br />\nstudents from exploitation,\"<br />\nMitchell said. \"They will not be<br />\nput in the position where they're<br />\noverloaded with hundreds of<br />\nstudents.\"<br />\nWhen asked what course of action would be taken if one of the<br />\nselected teachers proves to be ineffectual, Mitchell replied that \"a<br />\nmeeting would be called for the<br />\nstudent and the mentor and the<br />\nappropiate action would be<br />\ndetermined.\"<br />\nStudents seem receptive to the<br />\nidea of graduate students teaching<br />\ncourses. Sophomore Jonathan Ko<br />\nsaid that the fact that graduate<br />\nstudents will teach does not<br />\nbother him if they are really<br />\nqualified in the field.<br />\n\"I have no problems with it,\"<br />\nKo said. \"Being closer to our<br />\nage, they may even be able to<br /><br />\n.<br />\n1<br /><br />\nrelate better to us<br />\nThe Black Students Union<br />\nCommittee on Research and<br />\nEducation has been lobbying for<br />\ncourses that deal with AfricanAmerican culture.

If this student<br />\nis really qualified to teach the<br />\ncourse, then yes, I think this is a<br />\ngood thing.

Many members expressed discontent with the new<br />\nchanges. Jessica Oyugi, vicepresident elect, was irritated with<br />\nthe fact that the position for which<br />\nshe had run successfully had been<br />\naltered significantly.<br />\nNelson said that there had been<br />\na constitutional convention to<br />\nwhich all council members were<br />\ninvited and recommended to attend, during which these changes<br />\nwere made.

His office duties had been changed from<br />\nthat for which he had run. Neither<br />\ndid he attend the constitutional<br />\nrevision session.<br />\nAfter considerable debate and<br />\nnegotiation, there was a proposal<br />\nto strongly recommend to the<br />\nBoard of Elections to withdraw<br />\nthe newly-revised constitution<br />\nfrom being subject to referendum<br />\non April 24. This action<br />\nnecessitated that the Board of<br />\nElections hold a meeting to<br />\ndiscuss the issue and make a final<br />\ndecision.<br />\nOpinions were split as many<br />\nbelieved that Council should<br />\nfinish what had been started, and<br />\nthat such an action would only be<br />\ndetrimental to next year's Council.

This wasn't the way<br />\nthe year was supposed to finish.<br />\nShe was supposed to go out with<br />\na smile and a wink and say<br />\nsomething pithy about how they'd<br />\nall do it again next year.<br />\nUnfortunately, she was breaking up with her boyfriend. This,<br />\nin her opinion, was not the way<br />\nto end a year.<br />\nShe languidly shuffled out of<br />\nher room and towards the kitchen. Zack was laying on the<br />\ncouch asleep. This almost made<br />\nher feel better, but then she<br />\nremembered that she was determined that her last days at school<br />\nwould be filled with self-pity.<br />\nDoris had a glass in the<br />\nmicrowave again. Miranda<br />\nwasn't even amused. Breaking up<br />\nhad that sort of effect on you. All<br />\nthe old jokes weren't funny<br />\nanymore. Heck, even the new<br />\njokes weren't funny anymore,<br />\nwhich she could tell by Zack's<br />\ncontinued presence.<br />\nDoris came in, sobbing. Great,<br />\nMiranda thought. Last night was<br />\nDoris' big goodbye to Chris.<br />\nMiranda hoped the goodbye<br />\nwasn't as big as it seemed.<br />\n\"What's wrong, Doris?\" she<br />\nasked with as much interest as she<br />\ncould muster.<br />\n\"I don't want to talk about<br />\nit,\"Doris sobbed.<br />\n\"Fine by me,\" Miranda said,<br />\nturning back to the kitchen.<br />\nDoris broke out in a cry.<br />\nMiranda could ignore sobbing,<br />\nbut a cry demanded even her<br />\napathetic attentions.<br />\n\"Now what, Doris?\"<br />\n\"Nothing.\"<br />\n\"Oh?\"<br />\n\"HebrokeupwithmeIhatehimIhatemyselfIjustwanttoDIE!\"<br />\nMiranda chalked off another<br />\none for Spring. Even though<br />\nDoris hadn't been going out for<br />\nthree years, even though she<br />\nhadn't come a hair-breadth's<br />\naway from marriage, even though<br />\nshe didn't have to conduct her<br /><br />\nrelationship over three thousand<br />\nmiles, she probably still needed<br />\ncaring and compassion.<br />\n\"Is that all?\" Miranda asked.<br />\nDoris pushed it up to a wail.<br />\n\"Hrnhmm?\" hrnhmmed Zack,<br />\nwalking into the hall groggily.<br />\n\"Doris and Chris broke up.\"<br />\nDoris moved from a wail to a<br />\nscreech. Miranda wondered how<br /><br />\nIn the final installment<br />\nof 'The Miranda Act,'<br />\nDoris weeps, Zack<br />\nconfesses, Carol breaks<br />\nup, and Miranda seethes<br /><br />\nmany settings she came with.<br />\n\"Oh,\" Zack said, mustering<br />\nabout as much sympathy as<br />\nMiranda was able.<br />\nDeciding that taunting Doris<br />\nwas probably out of taste, Miranda instead turned on Zack.<br />\n\"Besides, why are you still<br />\nhere anyway?\" she demanded.<br />\n\"I'm a running gag,\" Zack<br />\nquipped. \"Besides, didn't we go<br />\nthrough this whole thing already?<br />\nI'm only a guest.\"<br />\n\"Even after we set up your<br />\nwhole apartment and all?\"<br />\n\"Especially after. You don't<br />\nget it, do you?\"<br />\n\"Get what?\"<br />\n\"Why I never leave.\"<br />\n\"You're broke?\"<br />\n\"Well, other than that.\"<br />\n\"What.\"<br />\n\"I'd actually miss you guys.\"<br />\nThat did it for Doris, who<br />\nstarted bawling and hugging<br />\nZack. Miranda thought of a snide<br />\nobservation, but for once kept it<br />\nto herself.<br />\n\"Come on, Zack. You've got<br />\na life. . . what about your<br />\ngirlfriend?\"<br />\n\"Huh? Who?\"<br />\nMiranda almost hit him, but<br />\nthen he seemed to remember.<br />\n\"Oh, we broke up a while<br />\nContinued on page 5<br /><br />\nDear William<br />\nKing Richard Williamson XX was undoubtedly the happiest man<br />\nin the northeastern United States. From the piddling beginnings of<br />\nhis predecessors, he had managed to expand the Johns Hopkins<br />\nKingdom into a vibrant corporation, a profitable enterprise that cast<br />\nits shadow over continents as large as Africa and Asia. William had<br />\nhis hands in more pies than he could count\u2014polystyrene for the poor,<br />\nan archival project with 20th-century quadrophonic recordings, giraffe<br />\nand antelope cloning, and a proposed renaissance of acidic paper for<br />\nhistory books\u2014and the number grew every day. Six hundred years<br />\nhad passed since the schizophrenic Johns Hopkins had founded his<br />\nuniversity on the German model in 1876; now it controlled the lives<br />\nof billions. If the sun had never set ,on the Victorian Empire, who<br />\ncared? William had subsidiary rights to the sun and was underwriting<br />\nthe manufacture of another to speed global warming. Progress, he<br />\nhad learned, often came in strange guises.<br />\nLately, though, William had been haunted by ghosts from the past.<br />\nAn archival team from the Chesapeake Division had begun excavation of the university's original property to prepare it for the sexticentennial celebration next year, and he was expected to sift through<br />\nthe findings. The majority of the stuff was straightforward: evidence<br />\nof the 22nd-century administration genocide (a nasty business), pamphlets announcing the 2005 Tuition Hike Riot, and a mountain of<br />\nhumanitarian awards presented to William Richardson, his 20thcentury forerunner who had mangled the corporate structure in the<br />\nname of \"improving education.\" Silly man\u2014his time was long past.<br />\nBut King William was tickled by the minutiae the team had ex-<br /><br />\ntracted from what one operative called 'the little ditch building,' apparently the office for the student newspaper. The findings were thin<br />\n(the little nips, it seemed, had kept rather sloppy records) but there<br />\nwas a healthy amount of rotting paper from 1987 to 1991, the years<br />\njust before the building was annihilated by a wandering Patriot<br />\nmissile\u2014built, William noted, with Johns Hopkins APL technology.<br />\nWhat audacity the little newspaper twerps had had! He leafed through<br />\nthe issues from 1991, stunned into silence by the cavilling tone, the<br />\npathetic demands of the students. Smaller faculty? Lower tuition?<br />\nCampus diversity? He imagined the reaction of the administration<br />\nat the time. They probably listened patiently, tossed the paper into<br />\none of those quaint recycling buckets the team had dug up, and then<br />\nlaughed the students out the door.<br />\nWilliam, for his part, would have crushed them like ants. He could<br />\nsee no function for a student newspaper\u2014even then, when administrators might have read it. It stood in the way of progress, championed bourgeois values, and provided a forum\u2014William felt his pancreas flutter in disgust\u2014for student opinion. He glanced gratefully<br />\nat the portrait of Steven Muller, the university president who had<br />\nat least laid the groundwork for the oppression of the stupid publication. There was a man, he thought, who had priorities.<br />\nSeveral hours later, after sifting through more of the student<br />\neditorials than he cared to remember, William unleashed a relaxing<br />\nfart. His eye had locked on an item from an editorial page almost<br />\n500 years old. It read, \"Dear William\"<br /><br />\nLetters<br />\nWho Filched the Flags?; P.C. Is Wrong, but Don't Let the<br />\nBacklash Damage Progress; Hearing Cries of 'Union!'<br />\nTo the Editors:<br />\nOn Thursday night, April 18,just<br />\nas the the Spring Fair committee<br />\nmembers were finishing the final<br />\npreparations for Fair, eight flags<br />\nwhich had been hung in the<br />\nbreezeways between Merganthaler<br />\nand Remsen and Krieger and Ames,<br />\nwere discovered to have been stolen.<br />\nThe flags, which were intended to be<br />\ndecorations to complement the international theme of this year's Fair,<br />\nhad all been loaned to Spring Fair by<br />\nforeign embassies, under the condition that they be returned after Fair<br />\nunharmed. Unfortunately, this will<br />\nnot happen.<br />\nSpring Fair assumes part of the<br />\nblame for the loss of the flags, having naively overestimated the<br />\nmaturity and common sense of the<br />\nstudent population. Security, as well,<br />\nwas nowhere to be seen on the night<br />\nthe flags disappeared. Regardless of<br />\nwhere the blame lies, Spring Fair is<br />\nnow in the embarrassing position of<br />\nhaving to explain to eight foreign<br />\nembassies why, at one of the nation's<br />\nmost prestigious universities, this<br />\nwas allowed to happen.<br />\nOn a more positive note, one<br />\nanonymous person returned the<br />\nNigerian flag to the Spring Fair Office on Monday morning. Let's hope<br />\nmore than one person on this campus has a conscience. Flags can be<br />\nreturned, no questions asked, to the<br />\nSpring Fair Office in Levering Hall,<br />\neither by hand or through Campus<br />\nMail. We would really appreciate it.<br />\nLuciene Pisa<br />\nTo the Editors:<br />\nI am writing to respond to a statement made in the April 1991, issue<br />\nof the Spectator. Many of the unthinkable statements made in the<br />\nissue reflect a dangerous undercurrent to its backlash against the<br />\nPolitically Correct movement.<br />\nIn David Cohen's article<br />\n(\"Politics' Corruption of Higher<br />\nEducation: Tenured Radicals\") he<br />\nderisively states, \"Navajo farming<br />\ntechniques are to be accorded the<br />\nsame respect as Platonic<br />\nphilosophy.\" While I don't believe<br />\nthat agricultural practices are<br />\ngenerally on the same level as<br />\nphilosophy, I wonder if the author<br />\nhas ever considered the nature of the<br />\nNavajo religion, a religion much<br />\nmore entwined with the natural<br />\nworld than traditional Western<br />\nreligions. For all Mr. Cohen knows,<br />\nNavajo farming techniques could be<br />\nreflective of something as profound<br />\nas The Allegory of the Cave, but it<br />\ndoesn't seem to be something he has<br />\nlooking into.<br />\nUnfortunately, ignorance in Native<br />\nhistory is the norm. Consider Allan<br />\nBloom, who is mentioned in the next<br />\nparagraph as having \"fired the first<br />\nsalvo in defense of traditional learning.\" Although I have not read his<br />\nbook, I did attend his MSE<br />\nSymposium-sponsored speech last<br />\nyear. My most vivid memory of the<br />\nwhole evening was his out-of-hand<br />\nrejection (during the question-andanswer session) that any American<br />\nIndian tribe could have had<br />\ndemocratic governments before<br />\nEuropeans arrived. Whether or not<br />\nthey did (and many of them did), this<br />\nattitude is deeply offensive to me as<br />\na Native American. The traditonal<br />\nlearning he defends does not include<br />\nstudy of the Six Nations of the Iroquois Confederation. Nor does it include study of present day Native<br /><br />\nAmericans, like Wilma Mankiller,<br />\nPrincipal Chief of the Cherokee Nation (a sovereign nation with<br />\nsovereign laws).<br />\nI agree with the Spectator that the<br />\nPC school of thought, and especially its methods, are dangerous, but it<br />\nseems to me that all it offers is an<br />\nAllan Bloom-ish return to the status<br />\nqui ante. There is much enthnocentricity ingrained in American society, beginning with the idea that Columbus \"discovered\" America 500<br />\nyears ago, and sadly not ending with<br />\nAllen Bloom. There are inequalities<br />\nthat need to be addressed, especially when ignorance leads to pockets<br />\nof the Third World in America. Our<br />\nsociety is not going to ameliorate the<br />\ndesperate conditions of many tribes<br />\nif it doesn't know they exist. Traditional learning needs to change to<br />\nreflect real life. Obviously the PC<br />\nmovement is not the way to go about<br />\nit, but neither is what the Spectator<br />\nsuggests.<br />\nKrista Hegburg<br />\nTo the Editors:<br />\nOver the course of the last several<br />\nmonths, the University has been going through the process of planning<br />\nextensive renovations for Levering<br />\nHall (the Student Union). Several<br />\nmonths ago, a preliminary report<br />\nwas issued on the subject which<br />\nmany subjects had access to. Student<br />\nopinion on that report was solicited<br />\nat that time by the administration. In<br />\nthe past few weeks, a new report was<br />\nreceived by the University from the<br />\narchitects. The contents of this report<br />\nhave not yet been made available to<br />\nstudents.<br />\nI have been told by the administration that at the moment there is no<br />\nset time table for making final plans<br />\non renovations, and that I shouldn't<br />\nworry about student input being lost.<br />\nThat type of statement worries me.<br />\nWith no time table existing, I fear<br />\nthat these decisions are going to be<br />\nput off until the summer, at which<br />\ntime there will be little chance of<br />\nreceiving student input. It would be<br />\na big mistake to make decisions over<br />\nthe summer that will have such far<br />\nreaching effects on students for years<br />\nto come. The new Student Union is<br />\njust too important for that to happen.<br />\nI want to urge the administration to<br />\nset and publicize a time table on<br />\nplanning, as well as publicizing<br />\nmethods through which students can<br />\nvoice their opinions. The student<br />\nbody knows better than anyone else<br />\nwhat they want to see in a Student<br /><br />\nSince this is the last issue of<br />\nthe News-Letter for the<br />\nSpring 1991 semester, we<br />\nask that you hold all hate<br />\nmail until the beginning of<br />\nnext semester. At that time,<br />\nwe will gladly accept your<br />\npompous opinions and give<br />\nyou a chance to hop on your<br />\nvery own soapbox as long<br />\nas you follow these requirements: letters must be<br />\ntyped, double spaced, no<br />\nmore than 350 words, and<br />\ninclude the author's name<br />\nand telephone number. Letters must be signed by at<br />\nleast one but no more than<br /><br />\nUnion, and it would be a tragic<br />\nmistake not to listen to students on<br />\nthis matter.<br />\nDavid DuTot<br />\nTo the Editors:<br />\nIn fairness to all prospective<br />\nfreshman who will be deciding, over<br />\nthe next two weeks, whether or not<br />\nto attend Johns Hopkins, I feel<br />\nobligated to comment on the April<br />\n19 editorial \"Spy Before You buy.\"<br />\nThe writer may have attempted objectivity, but what came through was<br />\nthe ever-prevalent Hopkins Inferiority Complex.<br />\nThis love that much of our student<br />\nbody has for whining and harping on<br />\nproblems gets ludicrous after a<br />\nwhile. We have all chosen to attend<br />\nthis school, and while some students<br />\nmay have turned to Hopkins as a second choice, I have trouble believing that many chose to pay the<br />\n$20,000 pricetag as a last resort. I<br />\nfor one had a difficult time choosing between colleges, and I chose<br />\nHopkins as my first choice, not due<br />\nto a lack of alternatives.<br />\nWe at Hopkins are lucky to be surrounded by a beautiful campus in a<br />\ndiverse city. We study under a<br />\nbrilliant faculty, many of whom are<br />\neager to work with undergraduates<br />\nwho take the time to seek them out.<br />\nA large number of activities are constantly available on campus, and as<br />\na founder of Octopodes (a cappella<br />\nsingers), I can vouch for the willingness of a school staff and students<br />\nto support new ideas.(Despite comments about the SAC in the editorial,<br />\nwe exist as a student group<br />\nregardless of not meeting all the<br />\ncriteria of the SAC\u2014the student activities office is quite flexible.) As<br />\nfor living conditions, almost<br />\neveryone I know loved dorm life,<br />\nand required sophomore housing<br />\nmay help build a much-needed sense<br />\nof community. And the opportunity<br />\nafter dorm life to live in the middle<br />\nof Baltimore, in a rowhouse full of<br />\nstudents, is something my friends at<br />\nother colleges envy\u2014we seem to<br />\nhave the best of both worlds, so what<br />\nare we complaining about?<br />\nam not suggesting that Hopkins<br />\nstudents become a bunch of Pollyannas, eternally cheerful, oblivious to<br />\nwhat problems we really do have\u2014<br />\nthis would be dangerous. What I do<br />\nask is that we look at what we have<br />\nhere and then at the image we are<br />\ngiving potential students by<br />\ndownplaying our assets and<br />\nhighlighting negative attitudes. If we<br /><br />\ntwo persons. Letters which<br />\ndo not meet these conditions<br />\nwill not be printed.

What you really did<br />\nwas paint a very negative and unfair<br />\npicture of our University. You were<br />\nright in your assessment of Hopkins<br />\nfaculty being top-notch, but otherwise your information was decidedly wrong. The School of Arts and<br />\nSciences and the Whiting'Sth'ool'of<br />\nEngineering together employ 346<br />\nfull time and 428 part time faculty<br />\nmembers. Of those, 99 percent hold<br />\na Ph.D. and 1 percent have their<br />\nMasters. These faculty members<br />\nteach 98 percent of the classes here<br />\nat Hopkins while TA's and outside<br />\nprofessionals teach only a very small<br />\npercentage of classes.<br />\nAs a Blue Key Society member,<br />\nand a tour guide who you say has<br />\nsomething to gain by giving prospective students good or bad reviews,<br />\nI would like to remind you of<br />\nsomething. Blue Key, which<br />\ncelebrated its thirtieth anniversary<br />\nthis year, has always been and still<br />\nis a purely voluntary organization<br />\nrun by Hopkins students. Also, contrary to what you believe, tour<br />\nguides are average students and our<br />\nopinions and experiences aren't any<br />\nless important than any other student's. We know that Hopkins isn't<br />\nperfect and we never portray it to be.<br />\nWe accentuate the positive without<br />\nignoring the negative and give honest<br />\ncommentary about what is right and<br />\nwrong at Hopkins. We give tours to<br />\nprospective students and their<br />\nfamilies because we like our university and because we want their first<br />\nimpression to be a positive one.<br />\nThank God that their first contact<br />\nwith a Hopkins student is with one<br />\nof us and not with you.<br />\nSarah Christiano<br />\nTo the Editors:<br />\nAnuj Gupta did not write the<br />\nAmerican Green about Earth Day<br />\nlast week; I did. As Anuj's name<br />\nwas not printed anywhere on the<br />\noriginal copy, this fabrication<br />\ndisturbs me greatly, especially in<br />\nlight of the recent behavior of the<br />\neditorial staff. Two major mistakes<br />\nthat the News-Letter staff was informed of at least three times have<br />\nstill not been corrected in print. In<br />\nthe American Green ozone article,<br />\nthere is an important typo that reads<br />\n\"These treaties will replenish the<br />\nlost ozone\" when in fact they will<br />\nnot. Typographical errors can be<br />\nforgiven, but immediate correction<br />\nin print as soon as it is informed of<br />\nthe error is the responsibility of any<br />\neven semi-professional publication.<br />\nThe other error was the complete<br />\nrewording of a sentence in the<br />\nScience article on paper and<br />\nstyrofoam, which had the effect of<br />\ncompletely inverting the meaning.<br />\nLaura C. Nagel<br />\nEds. note: The News-Letter did<br />\nindeed make mistakes; correc-<br /><br />\ntions appear on the opposite<br />\npage. Asfor the recent behavior<br />\nofthe staff, tell us something we<br />\ndon't know\u2014they're animals.<br /><br />\nNEWS-LETTER/5<br /><br />\n\u2022<br /><br />\nDouble-Edged Pen<br />\n\"You only got in because<br />\nyou're Black!\"<br />\nWith every incoming acceptance letter into a highly<br />\nacclaimed college or university,<br />\nI received this response from my<br />\nwhite peers in high school. After<br />\nfour years of intense education at<br />\na renowned private preparatory<br />\nschool, the most intelligent<br />\nremark they could offer in the<br />\nheat of the moment was a \"You<br />\nonly got in because you're<br />\nBlack!\"<br />\nEven today, four years later,<br />\nmy peers continue to demonstrate<br />\nignorance and blind faith in their<br />\nown egos. My reference is to<br />\nDeborah Kanner, one of the<br />\neditors of the National<br />\nEnquirer\u2014! mean Hopkins Spectator \u2014and her recent article \"A<br />\nDouble-Edged Sword,\" which<br />\ndisplays not only a serious lack<br />\nof<br />\nunderstanding<br />\nabout<br />\naffirmative action, but a disregard<br />\nfor journalistic ethics as well.<br />\nLike many other people, Kanner<br />\nerroneously believes that affirmative action is a policy aimed at<br />\nbringing unqualified AfricanAmericans and other culturally<br />\nand linguistically diverse peoples,<br />\ninto universities like Johns<br />\nHopkins. This is bull, plain and<br />\nsimple. The true and valid reason<br /><br />\nfor instituting affirmative action<br />\nprograms is that such policies aim<br />\nat bringing qualified AfricanAmericans into this and other<br />\nuniversities. Why? Because<br />\n\"Only the educated are free.\"<br />\nThis is an end which all Blacks<br />\nseek, in one form or another. The<br />\nJohns Hopkins University motto<br />\nis: Veritas vos Liberabit or \"The<br />\nTruth [Education] will set you<br />\nFree.\" It's ironic that a minority<br />\nof the Johns Hopkins population<br />\nis taking it upon themselves to<br />\nchallenge our very rights to gain<br />\nthis key to unlock true freedom.<br />\nThe history of AfricanAmericans is testimony to this<br />\nquest for education and freedom.<br />\nFirst we started in bondage, obviously not free. During this<br />\nperiod, education belonged only<br />\nto free men, white men. Even<br />\nafter the abolition of slavery,<br />\neducation was unavailable to<br />\nblack people. Still today, many<br />\nAfrican-Americans remain<br />\nwithout equitable resources, opportunities, and education.<br />\nTherefore, the black man remains<br />\nunfree. Affirmative action is one<br />\nof the few means by which<br />\nAmerica attempts to assist this<br />\ngroup to obtain the education by<br />\nwhich real freedom can be won.<br />\nKanner contends that there is a<br /><br />\nClose Enough<br />\nIt was one of those weeks that to recapture the magic of moving.<br />\nWhile having all of your worldproves the old adage, \"Bad luck<br />\ncomes in five hundred twenty- ly goods in cardboard boxes is<br />\nthrees.\" Shortly after having my undeniably romantic, there is<br />\ncitizenship revoked for swearing, more to moving than the conI discovered that vandals had tainers.

We are<br />\nlearning more and more that cars<br />\nare a luxury we cannot afford.<br />\nOver the past ten years, more<br />\nAmericans<br />\nhave<br />\nbeen<br />\nkilled in automobile accidents<br />\nthan in both World Wars, the<br />\nKorean War, and the Vietnam<br />\nWar combined. Cars are one of<br />\nthe most noxious polluting<br />\ndevices we have. They are inefficient and dangerous, and better<br />\nmeans of transportation are<br />\nalready available. In fact, as late<br />\nas the 1940s, mass transportation<br />\nwas still the most commonly<br />\nused means of getting around.<br />\nDriving the equivalent of one<br />\ntank of gasoline produces 400<br />\npounds of carbon dioxide, one of<br />\nthe primary greenhouse gasses.<br />\n24 percent of all the carbon<br />\ndioxide produced in the U.S. is<br />\nproduced by car exhaust. Almost<br /><br />\nall the parts of a car are toxic or<br />\npolluting. Car batteries contain<br />\nheavy metals and very strong<br />\nacids. Air conditioners contain<br />\nCFCs, the major chemicals<br />\nresponsible for depleting the<br />\nozone in the ozone layer. Wiper<br />\nfluid, antifreeze, transmission<br />\nfluid, and brake fluid are all<br />\ndangerously toxic. And how<br />\nmuch of a car gets recycled or<br />\nreused after it has finished up its<br />\nshockingly short 5 year life span?<br />\nIn the U.S., the average<br />\nmileage of cars is a mere 19 miles<br />\nper gallon, but the average<br />\nmileage of cars in Western<br />\nEurope, Japan and America<br />\ntogether is 30 mpg. Already,<br />\nthere are production-line cars<br />\navailable on the market that get<br />\nmore than 50, and there have<br />\nbeen prototypes built which get<br />\nmore than 120 miles per gallon.<br />\nIf the average mileage of cars<br />\nin America was raised 2.8 miles<br />\nper gallon, we would save more<br />\noil than we used to import annual-<br /><br />\nPer Jambeck<br />\nly from Kuwait and Iraq combined. One half of the world's<br />\nconsumption of oil is used in cars.<br />\nWe are only 5 percent of the<br />\nworld's population, but we use 30<br />\npercent of its energy. The U.S.<br />\nuses three times the energy it produces and two-thirds of its oil is<br />\nused by cars.<br />\nWithin a city, there is no excuse for needing a car. In cities,<br />\nwhere cars sit in traffic jams and<br />\nidle at red lights, most cars spend<br />\na lot of their gasoline and energy<br />\ngoing nowhere. This is an incredible waste. If we got cars out<br />\nof our cities, we could make a<br />\nsignificant dent in the smog problem. Currently, in American<br />\ncities, cars produce one-half of all<br />\nnitrous oxides, which form nitric<br />\nacid in the air, two-thirds of all<br />\ncarbon monoxides, which<br /><br />\npoisonously replaces oxygen in<br />\nthe blood, and one half of all<br />\nhydrocarbons, which combine<br />\nwith nitrous oxides to produce<br />\nozone. Ozone high in the<br />\nstratosphere protects us from<br />\nultraviolet light, but ozone at<br />\nground level where it can be<br />\nbreathed destroys human lung<br />\ntissue.<br />\nImagine how much of a city<br />\ncould be used for other things,<br />\nsuch as parks, if it didn't have to<br />\nbe used for roads and parking<br />\nlots. Currently, one-half of all urban land area is pavement. In<br />\nL.A., two-thirds of the land area<br />\nis paved over for cars. Over all,<br />\n60,000 square miles of land in the<br />\ncontinental U.S. is paved. That's<br />\n2 percent of the total land area of<br />\nthe continental U.S., about the<br />\nsize of Georgia, or the size of<br /><br />\nMaryland, Virginia, Delaware<br />\nand New Jersey combined.<br />\nImagine every one of the MidAtlantic states paved over in<br />\nasphalt and concrete. Bush has<br />\nrecently called for doubling the<br />\nsize of our interstate highway<br />\nsystem, although nothing has<br />\ncome of it yet.<br />\nThe point is that there are better modes of transportation<br />\nalready available. Mass transit is<br />\nfaster and much more efficient.<br />\nIn the space equivalent to one lane<br />\nof highway, a bus lane can carry<br />\nup to 9,000 people per hour, a<br />\nlight rail can carry up to 15,000<br />\npeople per hour, and a heavy rail<br />\ncan carry up to 34,000 people per<br />\nhour. A lane of highway carrying cars can carry only 2,250<br />\npeople per hour, even assuming<br />\nthat the cars are carrying four<br /><br />\npeople each. How many people<br />\ndrive alone to work? Travelling<br />\non mass transportation is often<br />\neasier and entails less of a hassle<br />\nthan trying to deal with rush hour<br />\ntraffic.<br />\nTrains are faster, easier, and<br />\nmore available to everyone, particularly handicapped people who<br />\ncan't drive and poor people who<br />\ncan't afford a car. If we<br />\nswitched to mass transit, we<br />\ncould cut emissions of hydrocarbons in our cities by 90 percent,<br />\nof nitrous oxides by 75 percent,<br />\nand of carbon monoxides by 75<br />\npercent.<br />\nThe main point is that the more<br />\npeople who use mass transit, the<br />\nmore efficient it is. Baltimore has<br />\na very good mass transit system<br />\nof buses, and Amtrak goes almost<br />\neverywhere on the East Coast. If<br />\nyou need to go to DC, take the<br />\nMARC train.

Make no mistake,<br />\nwe're not talking heavy artistic or<br />\nmoral statement here.<br />\nBut basking in the post-Persian<br />\nGulf glow, this engaging action<br />\ndrama, starring a cadre of young<br />\nactors, never pretends to be one.<br />\nInstead, Toy Soldiers gives its<br />\nyoung audience exactly what it<br />\nbargains for: a rousing, not too<br />\ncomplex battle between good and<br />\nevil, with all-American delinquents resourcefully banishing<br />\ngreasy foreigners. It's a kind of<br />\nHome Alone for the Stridex set.<br />\nThe film opens with a hostage<br />\ncrisis in Mexico, where Luis Cali<br />\n(Andrew Divoff) has attempted to<br />\nforce the release of his father<br />\nEnrique (Jesse Doran), who is being extradited to the United States<br />\nfor trial on drug charges. When<br />\nit becomes clear that Enrique has<br />\nalready left Mexico, Luis drops<br /><br />\nhis hostages\u2014literally, from a<br />\nhelicopter\u2014and moves to the<br />\nUnited States to terrorize there.<br />\nHe lands at the Regis School,<br />\na gorgeous walled estate in<br />\nVirginia, where the son of the<br />\njudge assigned to his father's case<br />\ngoes to school. The boy is<br />\nhustled out under.federal protection, but Luis commandeers the<br />\nschool anyway, since many of the<br />\nother kids have parents influential enough to cause the necessary<br />\nhostage hysteria.<br />\nSo what kind of kids are we<br />\ndealing with at the Regis school?<br />\nFive spoiled, irreverent rejects<br />\nare the heroic focus of Toy<br />\nSoldiers. The students are barely held in check by Dean Edward<br />\nParker (Lou Gossett) and Headmaster Robert Gould (Denholm<br />\nElliott). Ringleader Billy Tepper<br />\n(Sean Astin) sells liquor to his<br />\nclassmates in mouthwash bottles<br />\nwhen he's not hotwiring phone<br />\nsex onto a homemade intercom<br />\nsystem.<br />\nThe terrorists aren't playing<br />\ngames, however, and they set<br /><br />\nelaborate traps to insure that none<br />\nof the students make an effort to<br />\nescape or thwart them. But you<br />\ncan't keep a bad kid down, and<br />\neventually the five young boys<br />\nhatch a plan of their own to regain<br />\nthe school.<br />\nBesides Tepper, the four<br />\nclassmates are basically fillers:<br />\nother than Joey Trotta (Wil<br />\nWheaton), the son of a mafia<br />\nleader, these characters aren't<br />\ngiven even one interesting trait.<br />\nPetrie's long sequences between<br />\nthe action are plodding and barely<br />\nkeep our attention, failing to complicate the characters in any way<br />\nthat might have separated this<br />\nfilm from the rest of the brat pack<br />\nflicks.<br />\nAs Tepper, Astin shines in the<br />\nlater sequences of the film as he<br />\nconfronts and confounds the terrorists. But he's a little too wise<br />\nto be playing such a wisecracker,<br />\nand even worse, he seems to<br />\nknow it. The character seems to<br />\nbore him, and Astin's the one actor in Toy Soldiers who seems<br />\nready for bigger and better things.<br /><br />\nIn the role of Joey Trotta,<br />\nWheaton has the part with the<br />\nmost potential. But he slips in and<br />\nout of his New York accent with<br />\nembarassing ease, and looks so<br />\nweak physically that his apparent<br />\nmental strength and ill-fated<br />\nresistance are laughable.<br />\nObviously, Regis doesn't house<br />\nthe world's junior rocket scientists, but we have to believe that<br />\nsomething beyond a mere survival instinct inspires their actions. Regrettably, no evidence is<br />\never given.

In this farewell<br />\nessay, I'd like to explain myself,<br />\nif possible. I'm not making excuses, mind you\u2014and I still hate<br />\nHome Alone\u2014but what ends up<br />\non the page in a review isn't<br />\nalways the whole story. Not to be<br />\npretentious, but there's a whole<br />\nphilosophy behind writing film<br />\nreviews, and as the final bell tolls<br />\nI think I've finally figured mine<br />\nout<br />\nThe aura of star power is<br />\nsomething tough to overcome.<br />\nThe first film I reviewed in<br />\nSeptember 1989 was Sea ofLove.<br />\nAs I left the theater, I had a vague<br />\nsense of discomfort. I didn't particularly like the film, but why?<br />\nAnd who was I to criticize Al<br />\nPacino for looking too old?<br /><br />\nThe perfect film is one that mirrors<br />\nlife, teaches about it, or even<br />\ntransforms it. Film can do that if it's<br />\ndone with care.<br />\nBy comparison, in 1990, Roger<br />\nEbert gave the thumbs-up to 64<br />\npercent of the movies he<br />\nreviewed. At the other end of the<br />\nscale, Hal Hinson of The<br />\nWashington Post praised only 34<br />\npercent. So that places me<br />\nsomewhere down towards the bitter and resentful end of the critical<br />\nequation. Call me the Butcher of<br />\nBaltimore.<br />\nBut!don't consider myself Mr.<br />\nNegative Critic. I love movies. I<br />\nwouldn't spend hours each week<br />\nat the theater and in front of the<br />\nVCR if I didn't. And I certainly<br />\nwouldn't be leaving Hopkins next<br />\nmonth to go spend three years and<br />\na lot of money in film school.<br />\nSure, it's not the toughest job<br /><br />\nIt took about a week to get over<br />\nit. After that, buoyed by the<br />\nnegative notices the film received from many critics(Hinson<br />\nliked it, by the way), I plunged<br />\nright ahead. Go with what you<br />\nknow, read as many other<br />\nreviews as you can after you've<br />\nwritten yours, and act like you<br />\nknow what you're talking about.<br />\nIt worked wonders. Suddenly, I<br />\nthought, I do know what I'm talking about.<br />\nWhat makes a movie good or<br />\nbad? In my opinion, a great director with all the visual tricks in the<br />\nworld cannot salvage a bad<br />\nscreenplay. I'll take the<br />\nstoryteller (Spielberg) over the<br />\nstylist(Stone) any day. It's more<br /><br />\nimportant that the characters have<br />\ndepth than that the director<br />\nthought it was a brilliant idea to<br />\nattach the camera to a character's<br />\ngenitals during a lovemaking<br />\nscene.<br />\nOn the other hand, a sitcom<br />\ndirector can do no wrong with a<br />\nfairy tale about a make-good<br />\nhooker, who happens to be<br />\nplayed by the hottest young actress in Hollywood. I could have<br />\ndirected Pretty Woman; a blind<br />\nman could have directed it.<br />\nThere's plenty of sufficiently<br />\ntalented directors out there<br />\nwaiting for a modestly competent<br />\nscript and a little casting luck to<br />\nmake them look good.<br />\nHow often do the two\u2014quality<br />\ndirection and quality writing\u2014<br />\ncome together? I have no idea. I<br />\ndon't know much about directing,<br />\neven less about acting, except<br />\nwhat I've learned on this job. My<br />\nbackground is in writing, and it<br />\nqualifies me to write film reviews<br />\nbecause writing happens to be the<br />\nmost important part. If a line of<br />\ndialogue sounds natural, anyone<br />\ncan say it or film it. A great<br />\nmovie can't exist without a great<br />\nscript.<br />\nThe biggest beef I hear from<br />\npeople who disagree with my<br />\nreviews is that they go to the<br />\nmovies for enjoyment. The implication, of course, is that I<br />\ndon't. They envision me sitting<br />\nin a dark theater, grimly shaking<br />\nmy head and jotting down this<br />\nand that, harpooning the more<br />\ntalented and successful if I can<br />\nthink of a witty phrase to match.<br />\nIn a way, they're right. I expect a certain amount of intelligence in a film. I expect that<br />\nmy ever-increasing ticket investment be taken seriously. Every<br />\nfilm begins with promise: the<br />\nchance that it may be the perfect<br />\nfilm, the one that mirrors life,<br />\nteaches about it, or even<br />\ntransforms it.

Observed nationwide also<br />\nas National Victim's Week, this<br />\nevent serves, as expressed by<br />\nMarilyn Gall, R.N., of the Student Health Clinic, \"to do exactly<br />\nas it says, help people recognize<br />\nthat it can happen, and that they<br />\nmust remain aware so that they<br />\ncan react to a possibly dangerous<br />\nsituation before they find<br />\nthemselves trapped in it.\"<br />\nGall explained that Rape<br />\nAwareness Week is highlighted<br />\nby the Student Health Clinic as<br />\nare all events dedicated to raising<br />\nawareness on serious health<br />\nissues, such as National Condom<br />\nWeek. Although the Rape Crisis<br />\nCenter is more active in promoting rape awareness and<br />\ntreating victims, Gall says that the<br />\nclinic often learns of cases of rape<br />\nweeks, months, or even years<br />\nafter the fact. Students come in<br />\nfor other health concerns, and the<br />\nclinic is able to help him or her<br />\nin finding a treatment facility.<br />\nThe Health Clinic also provides<br />\nfree screenings to students concerned about the possibility of<br />\npregnancy or contraction of sexually transmitted disease.<br />\nGall emphasized that, especially on college campuses, issues of<br />\nsexual assault go beyond simple<br />\nviolence.<br />\n\"It's often the subtleties of<br />\ngender relations and sexual<br />\nassault that pose problems in<br />\ncommunities such as this,\" she<br />\nsaid. \"People don't recognize<br />\ntheir vulnerabilities in groups.<br />\nWhen alcohol is involved and<br />\ncertain individuals act on<br />\nmisinterpretations of sexual relationships, one or the other often<br />\nfinds themselves being forced<br />\ninto having a sexual experience<br />\nthey didn't want.\"<br />\nSharon Reynold, Assistant<br />\nDirector of Residential Life and<br />\na Medical Advocate at the Sexual Assault Recovery Center<br />\n(SARC) explains that the weeklong event is organized nationally by various social action<br />\ncoalitions.<br />\nIn Maryland and Baltimore, the<br />\nGovernor and Mayor respectively<br />\nhave issued official proclamations<br />\nof Rape Awareness Week, and<br />\nthe media has focused on<br />\nstatistics, awareness, and community efforts to bring down the<br />\nnumber of victims. Recent<br />\nstatistics in the Baltimore Sun<br />\nindicate that in 1990, 21,084<br />\nrapes were reported in Maryland,<br />\na 23 percent increase from 1989.<br />\nFurther studies suggest that these<br />\nreported rapes account for only<br />\napproximately 10 percent of the<br />\nactual total.<br />\nMs. Reynolds cited various<br />\nSARC-sponsored workshops and<br />\ninformation sessions aimed at<br /><br />\npromoting general awareness and<br />\ncommunication between the sexes<br />\nas examples of community<br />\nactivities during the week, and<br />\nencouraged all interested individuals to attend the \"Take<br />\nBack the Night\" Rally to be held<br />\ntonight, April 26th, at 6:30 p.m.<br />\nat Rash Field .near the Inner<br />\nHarbor.<br />\n\"It's purpose is to help get the<br />\nnight back for people to be safe,\"<br />\nshe explained. \"It hopes to raise<br />\nawareness on safety issues and<br />\nrape prevention, and should be<br />\nattended by several speakers on<br />\nviolence toward women.\"<br /><br />\nReynolds has taken an active<br />\nrole herself in promoting rape<br />\nawareness, speaking earlier this<br />\nweek at a Brown Bag Luch Series<br />\nLecture on issues of safety and<br />\nprevention.<br />\n\"I think the biggest problem is<br />\nthat people just aren't prepared,\"<br />\nshe says. \"We need to be aware<br />\nof our surroundings all the time,<br /><br />\nand have a game plan in case of<br />\nemergency.\"<br />\nBoth Gall and Reynolds agree<br />\nthat if Rape Awareness Week<br />\nserves its purpose, it will help<br />\nbring about an overall awareness<br />\nand commitment to precaution by<br />\nall members of the community.<br />\n\"Everybody is at risk all the<br />\ntime,\" concluded Gall. \"It's important to think in advance<br />\nbecause when a situation arises<br />\nour reaction time is always<br />\nslowed. It may be that bit of extra planning that helps us carry<br />\nthrough when the time comes.\"<br />\nSome safety tips noted by Gall<br />\nand Reynolds include:<br />\n\u2014take account of your surroundings and devise a game plan<br />\nin advance<br />\n\u2014when walking to your car,<br />\nhave your keys in hand and check<br />\nunderneath the car before approaching to unlock the door<br />\n\u2014travel in groups after dark<br />\nand in risky areas: even traveling<br />\nin two's is often not enough<br />\n\u2014know the individuals well<br />\nwith whom you put yourself in<br />\npotentially dangerous situations<br />\n\u2014\"yes\" means yes and \"no\"<br />\nmeans no<br />\nSARC's twenty-four hour<br />\nhotline is 366-RAPE, and the<br />\nHealth Clinic or its answering<br />\nservice can also be contacted at<br />\nany hour for assistance at<br />\n338-8270.<br /><br />\nSexual Assault Recovery<br />\nCenter Program<br /><br />\nLet me take you down,cause<br />\nCamden Fields, soon to be real.<br /><br />\nO's on the Move<br />\nBaltimore Building New Ballpark<br />\nby Steve Rhim<br />\nBaltimore's new downtown<br />\nCamden Yards ballpark will open<br />\nin 1992 in what the Maryland<br />\nStadium Authority calls a true<br />\n\"Opening Day.\" The stadium, a<br />\n105.4 million dollar project, will<br />\nreplace Memorial Stadium as<br />\nhome to the Orioles. Although<br />\nmost people support the building<br />\nof the new stadium, there are<br />\nthose who are not sure that the<br />\nconstruction is necessary.<br />\nMemorial Stadium will still<br />\nhold more seats than the<br />\ndowntown park. Memorial<br />\nStadium has a capacity of53,371<br /><br />\nC<br /><br />\nMay 14:<br />\n6:30\u2014Volunteer Orientation at Sexual Assault<br />\nRecovery Center<br />\nJune 11-20:<br />\nVolunteer Training Program<br /><br />\nalr1At4 W 1.1 CE.1 BACK jfiI<br />\nTV.= SrAODS \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022<br />\n00<br /><br />\n6:00 p.m.\u2014Take Back the Night March<br />\nParticipants are invited to meet in downtown<br />\nBaltimore for a one-mile march to a rally where<br />\nspeakers will address the issue of sexual assault.<br /><br />\nMay 5:<br />\nA Sunday In the Park With Saks\u2014<br />\nCrafts and flower displays presented to benefit<br />\nthe Sexual Assault Recovery Center<br /><br />\nrevenues are enough to allow the<br />\nOrioles to remain competitive in<br />\nthe market. The new facilities<br />\ninclude skyboxes, handicapped<br />\nseating, club level seating, private<br />\nand party suites, and bleacher and<br />\ngeneral admissions seating. The<br />\nconstruction of Memorial<br />\nStadium had not permitted such<br />\nfeatures at a reasonable cost.<br />\nThe popularity of the new<br />\nCamden Yards stadium has contributed to Baltimore's selection<br />\nas the site of the 1993 Major<br />\nLeague All-Star Game. It is<br />\nestimated that such an event will<br />\nbring more than 50 million dollar<br />\nin economic benefits to the area<br /><br />\n0100.40041.1..ibs.T<br /><br />\nApril 26:<br />\n9:00 a.m.\u2014Health Fair at Franklin Square<br />\nHospital<br /><br />\nApril 30; May 1, May 2, May 6, May 7:<br />\nPhone-A-Thon\u2014Sexual Assault Recovery Center<br />\npresents a five-night telethon beginning on April<br />\n30 on Channel 2.<br /><br />\ndiminish the amount of traffic<br />\nentering the downtown area. By<br />\nhaving the stadium downtown,<br />\ntraffic leaving the Inner Harbor<br />\narea will also be diminished. It is<br />\nexpected that residents of<br />\ndowntown Baltimore will walk to<br />\nthe ballpark.<br />\nThe Light Rail System, in<br />\naddition to improvements in the<br />\nMARC commuter service and the<br />\nMTA bus service, will expand the<br />\nInner Harbor area commercially<br />\nand demographically. It iq<br />\nestimated that the stadium will<br /><br />\npeople, while the new stadium<br />\nwill hold only 47,000. The<br />\nYards stadium,<br />\nCamden<br />\nhowever, will have no obstructed<br />\nview seating.<br />\nParking facilities will also be<br />\nimproved. Moving from<br />\nMemorial Stadium to Camden<br />\nYards is expected to lessen traffic problems in the city. The site<br />\nhas 5,000 parking spaces;<br />\nhowever, 20,000 more are<br />\navailable in the downtown area.<br />\nResidents of north Baltimore,<br />\nTowson, and the Cockeysville<br />\narea will be able to take the<br />\nplanned Light Rail System to the<br />\nstadium. The rail system will<br /><br />\ngenerate 1.1 billion dollars in<br />\nrevenues for the city. The new<br />\nstadium will definitely impact the<br />\ncity's economy in a positive way<br />\nsince no tax-payer dollars are being used in construction. Funding<br />\nfor the stadium comes solely from<br />\nthe sales of revenue bonds.<br />\nMaryland citizens support the<br />\nproject only through the purchase<br />\nof instant lotteries dedicated to the<br />\nMaryland Stadium Authority, or<br />\nby attending a game at the new<br />\nballpark. Returns from the<br />\nstadium investment will contribute to the funding of hospitals,<br />\nhomeless shelters, educational<br />\nenhancements and welfare<br />\nassistance.<br />\nAnother important reason for<br />\nthe construction of the Camden<br />\nYards park is the preservation of<br />\nthe Orioles as a Baltimore based<br />\nteam. The new stadium assures<br />\nthat the Orioles will remain in<br />\nMaryland for at least fifteen more<br />\nyears. The variety in seating<br />\narrangements will ensure that<br /><br />\nLIOW<br /><br />\nPOPCC<br /><br />\nin a single week.<br />\nEven with the construction of<br />\nthe new ballpark, old Memorial<br />\nStadium will not lose its importance. Once the Camden Yards<br />\npark is completed, arrangements<br />\nwill be made to give Baltimore a<br />\nprofessional football team.<br />\nMemorial Stadium will be used<br />\nas a provisional stadium for the<br />\nfootball team. There are future<br />\nplans to eventually build a football stadium next to Camden<br />\nYards baseball park. It is hoped<br />\nthat these new developments will<br />\nbring both status and economic<br />\nbenefits to the city and the state.<br /><br />\nOrchestrating the HSO<br />\nby Elizabeth Lipnick<br /><br />\nViolins, violence, silence...<br />\nThe BMA ain't the only one around here with culture.<br /><br />\nLoren Reith<br /><br />\nThe Hopkins Symphony Orchestra(HSO)has been alive and<br />\nkicking for 70 years, but it first<br />\nattracted attention in the early<br />\n1980s when a Peabody graduate<br />\nstudent, Catherine Overhauser,<br />\nexpanded the orchestra's mission.<br />\nThe HSO is a community<br />\norchestra comprised of approximately 70 musicians from the<br />\nBaltimore community, as well as<br />\nHopkins students, faculty and<br />\nstaff.

But those reports were apparently based on tests with contaminated material. What I found<br />\nwith the purified left-handed<br />\nsugar was that it tasted the same<br />\nas right-handed sugar.\"<br />\nHowever, do not expect to see<br />\nLev-0-Cal in your diet soda<br />\ntomorrow. Biospherics has a few<br />\nproblems to work out before Lev0-Cal can be put into daily use.<br />\nFor one, Lev-0-Cal is still quite<br />\nexpensive to make. Regular<br />\nsugar, and even Nutra-Sweet,<br />\ncost about thirty-three cents a<br />\npound to make. Lev-0-Cal costs<br />\nabout one hundred dollars a<br />\npound. Why such a high price?<br />\nThe production of Lev-0-Cal requires only inexpensive raw<br />\nmaterials. The process, however,<br />\nrequires a long and complicated<br />\nseries of chemical and enzymatic<br />\nmodifications, and product is lost<br />\nwith each step. Dr. Lee Zehner,<br />\nthe research director at<br />\nBiospherics, expects nonetheless<br />\nthat the price can and will be<br />\nbrought down: \"If we can improve the efficiency and yield of<br />\nthe processes, that's money in the<br />\nbank.\"<br />\nEven with a lower cost of production, Lev-0-Cal may still be<br />\na long way from the stores.<br /><br />\nBiospherics must get FDA approval for Lev-O-Cal before it<br />\ncan be marketed. Other artificial<br />\nsweetners have encountered problems in this area, sometimes(as<br />\nin the case of saccharin) getting<br />\napproval and later being implicated as a carcinogen. Zehner<br />\ndoes not anticipate problems like<br />\nthese. Although Lev-O-Cal cannot be broken down into the<br />\nbody, there is no data suggesting<br />\nadverse effects. Three years of<br />\nlaboratory tests in animals have<br />\nshown no side effects from Lev0-Cal. \"If it went into fatty<br />\ndeposits or became attached to a<br />\nprotein, then you'd have a problem. But it's eliminated so<br />\nquickly\u2014ninety-nine percent<br />\nwithin forty-eight hours.\"<br />\nThe missing one percent, Dr.<br />\nZehner believes, is lost to experimental error\u2014\"as with any<br />\nexperiment, you have that one or<br />\ntwo percent that gets away from<br />\nyou.\" Still, the researches at<br />\nBiospherics will perform more<br />\nextensive tests for the FDA, using multiple doses daily over a<br />\ntwo-week period to assure that<br />\nthe unmetabolized sugar does not<br />\naccumulate and pose a health<br />\nrisk. If the FDA does approve the<br />\nuse of Lev-O-Cal, it may be in<br />\nstores in the form of low-calorie<br />\ncakes, pasteries, candy, etc., by<br />\n1995, providing an appealing<br />\nalternative to sugar.

But the Jays came right<br />\nback as Steve Vecchione won the<br />\nensuing faceoff and ran down to<br />\nscore untouched seven seconds<br />\nlater. The Terpsjumped ahead to<br />\na 3-1 lead before the Jays called<br />\ntime-out. That seemed to work as<br />\nHopkins scored once more in the<br />\nfirst, on a ten yarder from Seth<br />\nTierney, and then tied the game<br />\nto start the second quarter when<br />\nVecchione scored his second, off<br />\nanother faceoff.<br />\nThat's when Maryland took<br />\nover. Or at least took advantage<br />\nof what the Jays were giving. The<br />\nTerps used length-of-the-field<br /><br />\npassing to break the Hopkins ten 1<br />\nman ride and to generate several<br />\nempty net opportunities. At the<br />\nvery least, the Terps were getting<br />\nthe ball in the Jays' zone in<br />\nunsettled situations. With<br />\nHopkins' goalie Scott Giardina<br />\ncoming out of the net to cover a<br />\nMaryland attacker, the Terps<br />\ntook several long range shots.<br />\nAlthough none of them scored,<br />\nthey forced Giardina to play<br />\ncloser to the goal than he would<br />\nhave liked.<br />\nInjuries didn't help the Jays any<br />\nthis week either. Thirteen goal<br />\nscorer Adam Wright was sitting<br />\nout the game with a separated<br />\nshoulder. Second line midfielder<br />\nCharlie Speno also watched the<br />\ngame from the sidelines. Seth<br />\nTierney played, but with an injured wrist.
