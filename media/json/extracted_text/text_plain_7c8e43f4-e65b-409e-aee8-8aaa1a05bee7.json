It measures<br />\nthe toughness, stability, over-all performance and economy characteristics<br />\nof the cars that take up its challenge\u2014<br />\nin a way that compresses years of driving<br />\npunishment into 500 blazing miles. This<br />\nyear mechanical failures claimed over 50<br />\nper cent of the cars that entered. That's<br />\nwhy Tiny Lund's victory in a Ford (with<br />\nfour other Fords right behind him) is a<br />\nremarkable testimony to sheer engineering excellence.<br />\nLund attributed his victory in part to<br />\nthe \"missing pit stop.\" He made one less<br />\npit stop for fuel than his competition\u2014<br />\nproving that Ford economy can pay off<br />\nin some fairly unlikely situations!<br />\nEconomy and the winner of the Daytona 500 might sound like odd bedfellows<br />\nat first. Yet economy is basic in every car<br />\nwe make... yes, even the Thunderbird<br />\nis an economy car in its own way. Here's<br />\nwhat we mean .<br />\nEconomy is the measure of service and<br />\nsatisfaction the customer receives in relation to the price he pays for it. It does<br />\nnot mean, however, austerity ... you<br />\nhave taught us this. Americans want\u2014<br />\nand we try hard to give them\u2014cars that<br />\nare comfortable to ride in, fun to drive,<br />\nand powerful enough to get out of their<br />\nown way. Not many Americans want to<br />\nsettle for basic transportation. You see<br />\nthis in our sales figures\u2014more than half<br />\nof our 1963 sales are coming from the top<br />\nof each model line. We're selling convertibles, hardtops, the jazzy cars ...<br />\nthe bucket-seat, high-performance, luxury editions are going like hot cakes.<br />\nYet for all the fun that people are<br />\ndemanding in their cars, they still are<br />\n<br />\nvery conscious of the element of thrift\u2014<br />\nof avoiding unnecessary expense. This is<br />\nthe kind of economy we build into every<br />\ncar from the compact Falcon to the luxurious Thunderbird.<br />\nThere's a special economy,for instance,<br />\nIn Ford's freedom from service. Every<br />\ncar and virtually every wagon can travel<br />\n36,000 miles before it needs a major<br />\nchassis lubrication. Other routine service<br />\nhas been reduced, too\u2014because these<br />\nFords are simply built better\u2014and of<br />\nbetter materials\u2014than ever before.<br />\nIn its own elegant way, even the<br />\nThunderbird gives you economy. It will<br />\ntravel 100,000 miles or 3 years before you<br />\nhave to lubricate the chassis. Thunderbirds have a way of becoming classics\u2014<br />\nas a look at their remarkably high resale<br />\nvalue will quickly tell you.

Ken Lassen<br />\nMotto: \"THAT YELLOW RAG PRINTS TRUTH, SOMETIMES.\"<br />\n\u2014Dean G. Wilson Shaffer<br />\n<br />\nAnd Round Again<br />\nNow that the poorly handled elections have capped<br />\nthe term of the out-going Student Council with an appropriate crescendo of ineptitude, it behooves us to address the last worn segment of our nearly used typewriter<br />\nribbon to the equally worn problem of the nature and<br />\nJunction of representative government on a University<br />\ncampus. The question is, as it has always been, to define<br />\nthe place of a political body in a community which is<br />\nessentially apolitical and our mind is, quite frankly,<br />\ndivided on the subject. We have suggested that there is<br />\nno place for representative government under the present<br />\norganization of the Hopkins community; we have suggested ways to carve out such a place. Either reaction<br />\nwould be valid under the circumstances and either way<br />\na more realistic organization would be achieved.<br />\nThe point is that there are too many people doing<br />\nthe same kind of thing. Autonomous organizations such<br />\nas the Booster Club, Cotillion Board, and D.S.R.C. operate within their own fairly well defined spheres of activity, and in general, operate effectively. Thus, when<br />\nthe Student Council ventures to do something, it inevitably encroaches on someone else's political turf. The<br />\nresult of this has been apparent this year as a completely inactive and ineffective Council was scarcely<br />\nmissed in the community it is supposed to represent<br />\nbecause all of its functions were either non-vital or<br />\naccounted for by someone else.<br />\nThe lesson of the last few years is that there is<br />\npresently no need for an autonomous Student Council<br />\nand a set of equally autonomous activities at Hopkins.<br />\nThe solution would he either to subordinate the Council<br />\nto the activities by establishing a co-ordinating committee of organization heads or to subordinate the activities<br />\nto the Council by giving the Council their functions and<br />\nestablishing them as committees of the parent group.<br />\nIn either case efficiency, the summum bonurn of the<br />\norganizers among us, would be served without serious<br />\ndamage to our present relaxed, irresponsible, apathetic<br />\ncarefree way of life.<br />\nSteve Roth, newly elected Student Council president, has another solution to the problem of making<br />\nrepresentative government meaningful. Realizing that<br />\nwhat the Council needs is an extended sphere of activity,<br />\nhe proposes to expand into realms which are now the<br />\ndomain of the Administration.<br />\nHe does not, unfortunately, specify what these are.<br />\nAnd the Administration has shown that it has little<br />\npatience with undergraduate schemes that are not<br />\nworked out in meticulous detail. Consequently, while<br />\nwe are entirely in sympathy with Roth's motivations,<br />\nwe must, on practical grounds, remain just a wee bit<br />\nskeptical.<br />\nBy setting himself this kind of a task, Roth runs<br />\nhead on into the bog which has nonchalantly absorbed<br />\nthe best efforts of past groups. The Council must set a<br />\ndirection for itself, a concrete goal involving concrete<br />\nmeans to an extremely nebulous end. We wish them luck.<br />\n<br />\nThe Battle For Peace<br />\nThe Active Pacifists, a phenomen as characteristic<br />\nof the season as the blooming magnolias, have come<br />\nforth to remind us that there may never be another<br />\nSpring for them to demonstrate in. Decked out for<br />\nEaster in their finest Social Involvement, the members<br />\nof CONCERN have made an admirable effort to turn us<br />\ntoward peace with their Easter-Passover peace walk.<br />\nThe involvement of the name of Johns Hopkins<br />\nin this effort, and the presence of a number of men<br />\namong the marchers, who command respect, make it<br />\nimpossible to ignore the questions raised by the demonstration. There 18 no necessity here to discuss peace, the<br />\nBomb, Cuba etc. Audacity does not extend that far. What<br />\ndoes hear consideration is the nature of the Peace movement itself, specifically the politically unrealistic nature<br />\nof its appeals.<br />\nTo he sure, a public demonstration increases the<br />\ngeneral awareness of the problem. The political effectiveness of such a rally remains, however, extremely dubious.<br />\nOne suspects that cries of anguish have singularly little<br />\neffect on the politic ans who make things happen in this<br />\nthreatened world. And unless someone in an effective<br />\nposition of power is profoundly influenced, all of the<br />\npublic outrage in the world will do no good.<br />\nTo be sure public opinion counts for something,<br />\nbut it would appear that the considerable intellectual<br />\ntalent which strolled on Easter Sunday would be put to<br />\nmuch better use if it were directed towards influencing<br />\nthe real powers in this country in the language to which<br />\nthey are accustommed. Were these men to bend their<br />\nefforts towards the establishment of a Peace lobby (or<br />\nthe support of one if it already exists) their message<br />\nwould be far more likely to take effect where it would do<br />\nthe most good.<br />\nIt would seem that effective political action would<br />\nhe more readily influenced by effective political infighting than by more spectacular but less immediate means.<br />\n<br />\n'David And Lisa Lacks<br />\nPerfection Of 'Cybele'<br />\nIf David and Lisa is the best walks through the park with<br />\nAmerican film of past years, as Cybele, the strange magical symits being touted, then so much bols they use when together (cirthe worse for American films. cles in the water, spirits in the<br />\nFrank Perry, the director, has trees), and the juxtaposition of<br />\nmade, with the greatest inten- fragmentary scenes, by use of<br />\ntions and the smallest budget, a sound, overlapping music, and<br />\nvery ordinary movie out of very highly imaginative camera work<br />\nunordinary material.

This, too, is a \"first film\"<br />\nby Serge Bourguignon and it's<br />\nabout a difficult, strange relationship, so it invites comparison. Here, it is the story of a<br />\nman with amnesia, caused by<br />\nthe shocks of seeing a little girl's\"<br />\nface through his machine-gunsight during a bombing mission<br />\nin Tibet.

It measures<br />\nthe toughness, stability, over-all performance and economy characteristics<br />\nof the cars that take up its challenge\u2014<br />\nin a way that compresses years of driving<br />\npunishment into 500 blazing miles. This<br />\nyear mechanical failures claimed over 50<br />\nper cent of the cars that entered. That's<br />\nwhy Tiny Lund's victory in a Ford (with<br />\nfour other Fords right behind him) is a<br />\nremarkable testimony to sheer engineering excellence.<br />\nLund attributed his victory in part to<br />\nthe \"missing pit stop.\" He made one less<br />\npit stop for fuel than his competition\u2014<br />\nproving that Ford economy can pay off<br />\nin some fairly unlikely situations!<br />\nEconomy and the winner of the Daytona 500 might sound like odd bedfellows<br />\nat first. Yet economy is basic in every car<br />\nwe make... yes, even the Thunderbird<br />\nis an economy car in its own way. Here's<br />\nwhat we mean .<br />\nEconomy is the measure of service and<br />\nsatisfaction the customer receives in relation to the price he pays for it. It does<br />\nnot mean, however, austerity ... you<br />\nhave taught us this. Americans want\u2014<br />\nand we try hard to give them\u2014cars that<br />\nare comfortable to ride in, fun to drive,<br />\nand powerful enough to get out of their<br />\nown way. Not many Americans want to<br />\nsettle for basic transportation. You see<br />\nthis in our sales figures\u2014more than half<br />\nof our 1963 sales are coming from the top<br />\nof each model line. We're selling convertibles, hardtops, the jazzy cars ...<br />\nthe bucket-seat, high-performance, luxury editions are going like hot cakes.<br />\nYet for all the fun that people are<br />\ndemanding in their cars, they still are<br /><br />\nvery conscious of the element of thrift\u2014<br />\nof avoiding unnecessary expense. This is<br />\nthe kind of economy we build into every<br />\ncar from the compact Falcon to the luxurious Thunderbird.<br />\nThere's a special economy,for instance,<br />\nIn Ford's freedom from service. Every<br />\ncar and virtually every wagon can travel<br />\n36,000 miles before it needs a major<br />\nchassis lubrication. Other routine service<br />\nhas been reduced, too\u2014because these<br />\nFords are simply built better\u2014and of<br />\nbetter materials\u2014than ever before.<br />\nIn its own elegant way, even the<br />\nThunderbird gives you economy. It will<br />\ntravel 100,000 miles or 3 years before you<br />\nhave to lubricate the chassis. Thunderbirds have a way of becoming classics\u2014<br />\nas a look at their remarkably high resale<br />\nvalue will quickly tell you.

Ken Lassen<br />\nMotto: \"THAT YELLOW RAG PRINTS TRUTH, SOMETIMES.\"<br />\n\u2014Dean G. Wilson Shaffer<br /><br />\nAnd Round Again<br />\nNow that the poorly handled elections have capped<br />\nthe term of the out-going Student Council with an appropriate crescendo of ineptitude, it behooves us to address the last worn segment of our nearly used typewriter<br />\nribbon to the equally worn problem of the nature and<br />\nJunction of representative government on a University<br />\ncampus. The question is, as it has always been, to define<br />\nthe place of a political body in a community which is<br />\nessentially apolitical and our mind is, quite frankly,<br />\ndivided on the subject. We have suggested that there is<br />\nno place for representative government under the present<br />\norganization of the Hopkins community; we have suggested ways to carve out such a place. Either reaction<br />\nwould be valid under the circumstances and either way<br />\na more realistic organization would be achieved.<br />\nThe point is that there are too many people doing<br />\nthe same kind of thing. Autonomous organizations such<br />\nas the Booster Club, Cotillion Board, and D.S.R.C. operate within their own fairly well defined spheres of activity, and in general, operate effectively. Thus, when<br />\nthe Student Council ventures to do something, it inevitably encroaches on someone else's political turf. The<br />\nresult of this has been apparent this year as a completely inactive and ineffective Council was scarcely<br />\nmissed in the community it is supposed to represent<br />\nbecause all of its functions were either non-vital or<br />\naccounted for by someone else.<br />\nThe lesson of the last few years is that there is<br />\npresently no need for an autonomous Student Council<br />\nand a set of equally autonomous activities at Hopkins.<br />\nThe solution would he either to subordinate the Council<br />\nto the activities by establishing a co-ordinating committee of organization heads or to subordinate the activities<br />\nto the Council by giving the Council their functions and<br />\nestablishing them as committees of the parent group.<br />\nIn either case efficiency, the summum bonurn of the<br />\norganizers among us, would be served without serious<br />\ndamage to our present relaxed, irresponsible, apathetic<br />\ncarefree way of life.<br />\nSteve Roth, newly elected Student Council president, has another solution to the problem of making<br />\nrepresentative government meaningful. Realizing that<br />\nwhat the Council needs is an extended sphere of activity,<br />\nhe proposes to expand into realms which are now the<br />\ndomain of the Administration.<br />\nHe does not, unfortunately, specify what these are.<br />\nAnd the Administration has shown that it has little<br />\npatience with undergraduate schemes that are not<br />\nworked out in meticulous detail. Consequently, while<br />\nwe are entirely in sympathy with Roth's motivations,<br />\nwe must, on practical grounds, remain just a wee bit<br />\nskeptical.<br />\nBy setting himself this kind of a task, Roth runs<br />\nhead on into the bog which has nonchalantly absorbed<br />\nthe best efforts of past groups. The Council must set a<br />\ndirection for itself, a concrete goal involving concrete<br />\nmeans to an extremely nebulous end. We wish them luck.<br /><br />\nThe Battle For Peace<br />\nThe Active Pacifists, a phenomen as characteristic<br />\nof the season as the blooming magnolias, have come<br />\nforth to remind us that there may never be another<br />\nSpring for them to demonstrate in. Decked out for<br />\nEaster in their finest Social Involvement, the members<br />\nof CONCERN have made an admirable effort to turn us<br />\ntoward peace with their Easter-Passover peace walk.<br />\nThe involvement of the name of Johns Hopkins<br />\nin this effort, and the presence of a number of men<br />\namong the marchers, who command respect, make it<br />\nimpossible to ignore the questions raised by the demonstration. There 18 no necessity here to discuss peace, the<br />\nBomb, Cuba etc. Audacity does not extend that far. What<br />\ndoes hear consideration is the nature of the Peace movement itself, specifically the politically unrealistic nature<br />\nof its appeals.<br />\nTo he sure, a public demonstration increases the<br />\ngeneral awareness of the problem. The political effectiveness of such a rally remains, however, extremely dubious.<br />\nOne suspects that cries of anguish have singularly little<br />\neffect on the politic ans who make things happen in this<br />\nthreatened world. And unless someone in an effective<br />\nposition of power is profoundly influenced, all of the<br />\npublic outrage in the world will do no good.<br />\nTo be sure public opinion counts for something,<br />\nbut it would appear that the considerable intellectual<br />\ntalent which strolled on Easter Sunday would be put to<br />\nmuch better use if it were directed towards influencing<br />\nthe real powers in this country in the language to which<br />\nthey are accustommed. Were these men to bend their<br />\nefforts towards the establishment of a Peace lobby (or<br />\nthe support of one if it already exists) their message<br />\nwould be far more likely to take effect where it would do<br />\nthe most good.<br />\nIt would seem that effective political action would<br />\nhe more readily influenced by effective political infighting than by more spectacular but less immediate means.<br /><br />\n'David And Lisa Lacks<br />\nPerfection Of 'Cybele'<br />\nIf David and Lisa is the best walks through the park with<br />\nAmerican film of past years, as Cybele, the strange magical symits being touted, then so much bols they use when together (cirthe worse for American films. cles in the water, spirits in the<br />\nFrank Perry, the director, has trees), and the juxtaposition of<br />\nmade, with the greatest inten- fragmentary scenes, by use of<br />\ntions and the smallest budget, a sound, overlapping music, and<br />\nvery ordinary movie out of very highly imaginative camera work<br />\nunordinary material.
