The remaining 392,500<br />\nwill be wasting their time at \"educational rabbit-warrens known as<br />\nState Universities\" or a whole<br />\n\"alphabet of liberal arts colleges<br />\nwhich turn out a splendid facsimile of the Ivy League product.\"<br />\nThe one basic assumption that<br />\nthe author of the Holiday article<br />\nmakes is that this Ivy League<br />\nproduct is superior to all other<br />\ncollege graduates, by mere dint<br />\nof the fact that they are \"Ivy<br />\nMen.\" He loudly applauds the<br />\ncompulsory General Studies Program of Harvard and the Contemporary Civilization course at<br />\nhis Alma Mater.

In<br />\nfact he is rather vehement about it. While we agree with him<br />\nthat the major cause of lost games is not the formation, we<br />\nwould like to explore this \"formation\" question a little farther.<br />\nThere have been, and are, some very successful teams<br />\nWhich employ the single wing. UCLA is one team that comes<br />\nto mind as having<br />\nused the single wing very successfully this<br />\nYear.

The single wing is<br />\nknown as a power formation. Although deception is possible,<br />\nthe single wing<br />\nshows the ball more as the ball has to travel<br />\nsome three to four<br />\nyards to the fullback or tailback. Quick<br />\nopeners are not an integral part of single wing football, for<br />\nthe runner has<br />\nto wait for the ball to reach him before he<br />\nCan gather speed. In the \"T\" a quick opener is one of the most<br />\nsuccessful weapons. Why the emphasis on the quick opener?<br />\nBecause it requires a quick initial thrust on the part of the<br />\nlineman which enables a lighter man to get the jump on a<br />\nheavier opponent. By the time the opposing lineman has recovered, the play should be past him. In the single wing,<br />\nShoulder blocking is called upon more often than in the \"T\",<br />\nWhere a brush<br />\nblock is in order some of the time. Although<br />\ntherei may be<br />\nexceptions to this general rule of thumb, the<br />\nWing<br />\nfor a lack of requires a big heavy team which can make up<br />\nspeed through sheer manpower.

Therefore,<br />\nthe Jays are lacking one of the prime requirements of<br />\nI<br />\nLne single wing, power. Another point is that almost all the<br />\n'Joys that have played<br />\nhigh school ball or are playing Freshman ball this<br />\nnew Plays, year were taught the \"T\". That means learning<br />\nnew blocking, and new requirements for the<br />\nvarious positions.

We will come back to this question of speed in a<br />\nmoment.<br />\n, Mr. Bridgers' third point is that he lacks a \"T\" quarterback and a couple<br />\nof fast halfbacks.

The remaining 392,500<br />\nwill be wasting their time at \"educational rabbit-warrens known as<br />\nState Universities\" or a whole<br />\n\"alphabet of liberal arts colleges<br />\nwhich turn out a splendid facsimile of the Ivy League product.\"<br />\nThe one basic assumption that<br />\nthe author of the Holiday article<br />\nmakes is that this Ivy League<br />\nproduct is superior to all other<br />\ncollege graduates, by mere dint<br />\nof the fact that they are \"Ivy<br />\nMen.\" He loudly applauds the<br />\ncompulsory General Studies Program of Harvard and the Contemporary Civilization course at<br />\nhis Alma Mater.

This wee-Rend may add a \"one\" to the credit side of the ledger because<br />\nSwarthmore brings to town a team not as strong as the<br />\nBlack-and-Blue's first<br />\nfive opponents.<br />\nMr. Bridgers pointed out two weeks ago and has reiterated several times since that he does not feel that the use of<br />\nthe single wing formation is a<br />\ncause for the poor showing. In<br />\nfact he is rather vehement about it. While we agree with him<br />\nthat the major cause of lost games is not the formation, we<br />\nwould like to explore this \"formation\" question a little farther.<br />\nThere have been, and are, some very successful teams<br />\nWhich employ the single wing. UCLA is one team that comes<br />\nto mind as having<br />\nused the single wing very successfully this<br />\nYear. Tennessee and<br />\nPrinceton are two other schools that<br />\nhave had a lot of winning seasons with the single wing. Of<br />\ncourse there are<br />\n\"T\", but<br />\nthe fact is quite many, many more teams using the<br />\nclear: if you have the manpower, most any<br />\nformation will work.<br /><br />\nPhoto by Bill Bain<br /><br />\nJERRY CARR deflects pass to Dick Burroughs in recent game with Randolph Macon.<br /><br />\nFormation Differences<br /><br />\nBut what are the characteristics of the two formations in<br />\nquestion, the \"T\" and the single wing? The single wing is<br />\nknown as a power formation. Although deception is possible,<br />\nthe single wing<br />\nshows the ball more as the ball has to travel<br />\nsome three to four<br />\nyards to the fullback or tailback. Quick<br />\nopeners are not an integral part of single wing football, for<br />\nthe runner has<br />\nto wait for the ball to reach him before he<br />\nCan gather speed. In the \"T\" a quick opener is one of the most<br />\nsuccessful weapons. Why the emphasis on the quick opener?<br />\nBecause it requires a quick initial thrust on the part of the<br />\nlineman which enables a lighter man to get the jump on a<br />\nheavier opponent. By the time the opposing lineman has recovered, the play should be past him. In the single wing,<br />\nShoulder blocking is called upon more often than in the \"T\",<br />\nWhere a brush<br />\nblock is in order some of the time. Although<br />\ntherei may be<br />\nexceptions to this general rule of thumb, the<br />\nWing<br />\nfor a lack of requires a big heavy team which can make up<br />\nspeed through sheer manpower. The single wing<br />\nis<br />\nsynonymous with \"power.\"<br />\n'T' Emphasizes Speed<br /><br />\nOn the other hand the \"T\" is known as a formation of<br />\nand deception which can make up for a lack of beef.<br />\nThere will<br />\nimmediately be those who will point out that the<br />\nInost successful<br />\n\"T\" teams have very heavy lines. Weight<br />\nisn't\u201e<br />\na handicap if there is sufficient speed in any formation<br />\nthat we<br />\nknow of. The point is that in the \"T\u201d the weight adYantage is not as absolute an advantage as in the single wing.<br />\nSo far the discussion has been academic. We are working<br />\nUnder the assumption<br />\nthat the teams have the top manpower.<br />\nTherefore it is<br />\ncould defeat a conceivable that a light single wing team<br />\nheavier \"T\" team. But let's get down tia cases,<br />\nHopkins' case to be specific. We have a light team. Bridgers<br />\nhas said that<br />\nwe will probably be out-weighed by every team<br />\nwe play,<br />\nsometimes by as much as 15-20 pounds a man. Therefore,<br />\nthe Jays are lacking one of the prime requirements of<br />\nI<br />\nLne single wing, power. Another point is that almost all the<br />\n'Joys that have played<br />\nhigh school ball or are playing Freshman ball this<br />\nnew Plays, year were taught the \"T\". That means learning<br />\nnew blocking, and new requirements for the<br />\nvarious positions. True, a boy who knows how to block and<br />\n.<br />\ntackle and has a lot<br />\nof ability can make the transition without<br />\ntoo much trouble,<br />\nbut is this Hopkins?<br />\nspeed<br /><br />\nTeams Lack Speed<br /><br />\nMr. Bridgers points out that his team lacks speed which<br />\n9,uite necessary in the \"T\". This may be true. If it is, the<br />\n,:11 would not be as successful as it might be. But we wonder<br />\nnow slow the squad<br />\nis. If Hopkins used the \"T\", not as much<br />\nw_ eight would be<br />\nrequired and lighter, faster men might be<br />\nemployed. We will come back to this question of speed in a<br />\nmoment.<br />\n, Mr. Bridgers' third point is that he lacks a \"T\" quarterback and a couple<br />\nof fast halfbacks. There might not be a<br />\nquarterback out for football now, but we know of at least one<br />\n.<br />\nw11,0 is in<br />\nschool.<br />\nisn't big enough Why isn't he out for football? Because he<br />\nto take the pounding of the tailback and<br />\nisn t the<br />\nspeed demon necessary for a wingback. He is, however, a passer, kicker, and a sufficient speedster to be an<br />\n.asset rather than<br />\na liability as a runner\u2014the Eddie LeBaron<br />\n,<br />\ntype of player. With Wood, Bates, and Kady there are three<br />\n'Joys who could carry the mail from the halfback post. Lawr.ei,nce<br />\ni_<br />\nis no slow poke from the fullback slot. It is admitted that<br />\nis \"T\" team<br />\nwould not be the best in the land and that by<br />\nChanging<br />\nformations<br />\nthe Jays would not be transformed into<br />\nan<br />\nundefeated terror of the gridiron.<br />\n(Continued on Page 8)<br /><br />\nSPORTS SECTION<br />\nSwarthmore, Jays<br />\nIn Cross Country<br />\nMeet Tomorrow<br /><br />\nCrippled Grid Squad<br />\nTo Face Swarthmore<br /><br />\nHopkins varsity cross country<br />\ncontinues its '55 campaign as the<br />\nharriers take on the visiting<br />\nSwarthmore aggregation tomorrow, at Homewood.<br />\nJay Coach Lincoln Simon, using comparative times against a<br />\ncommon opponent, expects the<br />\ngoing to be a \"tight squeeze.\"<br />\nBoth the Blue Jays and the Garnets were beaten by Delaware, but<br />\nthe visitors did just slightly better in comparative times. \"If<br />\nboth teams run the way they did<br />\ntomorrow's<br />\nDelaware,<br />\nagainst<br />\nmeet should be a real humdinger,\" states the varsity mentor.<br />\nLast Saturday, the Hopkins<br />\nacross<br />\nhill-and-dalers traveled<br />\nthe state line to oppose a highlyrated Delaware team, and returned on the losing end of a 5 to 49<br />\nscore.
