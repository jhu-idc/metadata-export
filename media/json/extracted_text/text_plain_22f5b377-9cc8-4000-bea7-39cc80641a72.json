Assisted by Marshall Turner and Mickey Cochrane,<br />\nfrom the athletic department, and Jim Phinney, social director,<br />\nas advisors, Jennings is setting up pilot plant operation for the<br />\nnew dormitory, which will be open next year. To aid discipline,<br />\nhe has re-defined the old \"code of the gentleman,\" the guiding<br />\nprinciple of the DSRC, by setting clear and intelligent rules<br />\nwhere formerly the Council relied on the judgment of the<br />\nindividuals.<br />\nSocially, Jim Phinney plans to start a much more extensive<br />\n\u2022<br />\nprogram than ever before. He intends to replace some of the<br />\nequipment already in the Commons Room, and is installing a<br />\nping-pong table in a game room downstairs. He is thinking in<br />\nterms of inter-entry competition in outdoor sports, bridge, and<br />\nchess. He has already set up a Hopkins-Goucher committee which<br />\nwill work to bring Goucher girls to Hopkins athletic events and<br />\nto the dormitory social hours which are scheduled to follow them.<br />\nHe is planning for several discussion and musical evenings.<br />\nHe is also working on arrangements for several evening dances.<br />\nTo help him carry out this program, to provide transportation for the Goucher girls, and refreshments for the dances,<br />\nand to buy athletic equipment, this week he is asking each dorm<br />\nstudent to pay five dollars yearly dues. We wish him all the success<br />\nwith this venture.<br />\n<br />\nLowell Reed expects to remain<br />\npresident of the Johns Hopkins<br />\nUniversity for only three years\u2014<br />\neasily the shortest tenure of any<br />\nof the University's seven presidents<br />\n\u2014but he wants it positively understood that he is not to be considered an interlude or \"stopgap\"<br />\npresident.<br />\n\"As I told the Trustees,\" he<br />\nsays, flashing his cherubic grin and<br />\nwink, \"I am an operator. When I<br />\nget the machinery in my hands, I<br />\nlike to drive it.\" But he will not<br />\nannounce any particular goals or<br />\nambitions for his term, since he<br />\nfeels that he has not been on the<br />\njob long enough for such pronouncements.<br />\nPresident Reed took office on<br />\nSeptember 1, 1953, emerging from<br />\none of the shortest retirements on<br />\nrecord.

Dr. Reed had no presidential aspirations, but the trustees approached him and persuaded him that he was the only<br />\nman with sufficient ability, experience, and familiarity with Hopkins<br />\ninstitutions to handle the job.<br />\nAfter considering it for about a<br />\nmonth, Dr. Reed accepted. \"I<br />\nwas virtually drafted,\" he says.<br />\nIsaiah Bowman set the retirement age for Hopkins presidents<br />\nat 70, and retired at that age himself, in 1948. Dr. Reed, a plump,<br />\nfriendly, softspoken gentleman, of<br />\n67 years, expects to follow suit.

Kirkpatrick,<br />\nDirector of Food Service, has started on a Publicity campaign<br />\nof releases to the News-Letter and mimeographed circulars to<br />\nemployees at Hopkins and students at the dormitory. In almost<br />\nall of these he has stressed that suggestions and criticism will be<br />\naccepted and judged according to their financial practicality<br />\nand their appeal to the majority of those who eat at the dorm<br />\nand at Levering Cafeteria.<br />\nAll this is new to Hopkins, and at the dormitory particularly<br />\nrepresents a radical departure from tradition. Now, the time<br />\nhas come when Mr. Kirkpatrick 's publicity statements will be<br />\nput to test. At the dormitory, although nearly everyone is convinced that the quality of the food has greatly improved, there<br />\nhas been a general complaint about the quantity. Meanwhile, at<br />\nLevering the complaint has been that the quality has declined<br />\nslightly, and the size of the serving for a given price has been cut.<br />\nWe are not in a position to judge the validity of these<br />\ncomplaints, nor to evaluate various ways of dealing with them.<br />\nFurthermore, we suspect that a great deal of the complaining<br />\nis the standard gripe about the chow which goes on at any<br />\ninstitution. But we feel the complaints are serious enough that<br />\nMr. Kirkpatrick, if he is to continue the start he has made, must<br />\nanswer these complaints either by action or by An explanation<br />\nof the financial picture which does not allow him to meet the.<br />\ndemands being made.<br />\n<br />\ndevelop the intellectual capacity<br />\nof the individual.\"<br />\nHe anticipates no great changes<br />\nin the educational policies of his<br />\npredecessor.

Assisted by Marshall Turner and Mickey Cochrane,<br />\nfrom the athletic department, and Jim Phinney, social director,<br />\nas advisors, Jennings is setting up pilot plant operation for the<br />\nnew dormitory, which will be open next year. To aid discipline,<br />\nhe has re-defined the old \"code of the gentleman,\" the guiding<br />\nprinciple of the DSRC, by setting clear and intelligent rules<br />\nwhere formerly the Council relied on the judgment of the<br />\nindividuals.<br />\nSocially, Jim Phinney plans to start a much more extensive<br />\n\u2022<br />\nprogram than ever before. He intends to replace some of the<br />\nequipment already in the Commons Room, and is installing a<br />\nping-pong table in a game room downstairs. He is thinking in<br />\nterms of inter-entry competition in outdoor sports, bridge, and<br />\nchess. He has already set up a Hopkins-Goucher committee which<br />\nwill work to bring Goucher girls to Hopkins athletic events and<br />\nto the dormitory social hours which are scheduled to follow them.<br />\nHe is planning for several discussion and musical evenings.<br />\nHe is also working on arrangements for several evening dances.<br />\nTo help him carry out this program, to provide transportation for the Goucher girls, and refreshments for the dances,<br />\nand to buy athletic equipment, this week he is asking each dorm<br />\nstudent to pay five dollars yearly dues. We wish him all the success<br />\nwith this venture.<br /><br />\nLowell Reed expects to remain<br />\npresident of the Johns Hopkins<br />\nUniversity for only three years\u2014<br />\neasily the shortest tenure of any<br />\nof the University's seven presidents<br />\n\u2014but he wants it positively understood that he is not to be considered an interlude or \"stopgap\"<br />\npresident.<br />\n\"As I told the Trustees,\" he<br />\nsays, flashing his cherubic grin and<br />\nwink, \"I am an operator. When I<br />\nget the machinery in my hands, I<br />\nlike to drive it.\" But he will not<br />\nannounce any particular goals or<br />\nambitions for his term, since he<br />\nfeels that he has not been on the<br />\njob long enough for such pronouncements.<br />\nPresident Reed took office on<br />\nSeptember 1, 1953, emerging from<br />\none of the shortest retirements on<br />\nrecord.

Dr. Reed had no presidential aspirations, but the trustees approached him and persuaded him that he was the only<br />\nman with sufficient ability, experience, and familiarity with Hopkins<br />\ninstitutions to handle the job.<br />\nAfter considering it for about a<br />\nmonth, Dr. Reed accepted. \"I<br />\nwas virtually drafted,\" he says.<br />\nIsaiah Bowman set the retirement age for Hopkins presidents<br />\nat 70, and retired at that age himself, in 1948. Dr. Reed, a plump,<br />\nfriendly, softspoken gentleman, of<br />\n67 years, expects to follow suit.

They often make their decisions on the physical environment favorable to research<br />\nin seeking the truth, and then to<br />\nplant and the opportunities for extra-curricular activities.<br /><br />\nKirkpatrick Faces The Test<br />\nSince he has taken office this summer, Russell C. Kirkpatrick,<br />\nDirector of Food Service, has started on a Publicity campaign<br />\nof releases to the News-Letter and mimeographed circulars to<br />\nemployees at Hopkins and students at the dormitory. In almost<br />\nall of these he has stressed that suggestions and criticism will be<br />\naccepted and judged according to their financial practicality<br />\nand their appeal to the majority of those who eat at the dorm<br />\nand at Levering Cafeteria.<br />\nAll this is new to Hopkins, and at the dormitory particularly<br />\nrepresents a radical departure from tradition. Now, the time<br />\nhas come when Mr. Kirkpatrick 's publicity statements will be<br />\nput to test. At the dormitory, although nearly everyone is convinced that the quality of the food has greatly improved, there<br />\nhas been a general complaint about the quantity. Meanwhile, at<br />\nLevering the complaint has been that the quality has declined<br />\nslightly, and the size of the serving for a given price has been cut.<br />\nWe are not in a position to judge the validity of these<br />\ncomplaints, nor to evaluate various ways of dealing with them.<br />\nFurthermore, we suspect that a great deal of the complaining<br />\nis the standard gripe about the chow which goes on at any<br />\ninstitution. But we feel the complaints are serious enough that<br />\nMr. Kirkpatrick, if he is to continue the start he has made, must<br />\nanswer these complaints either by action or by An explanation<br />\nof the financial picture which does not allow him to meet the.<br />\ndemands being made.<br /><br />\ndevelop the intellectual capacity<br />\nof the individual.\"<br />\nHe anticipates no great changes<br />\nin the educational policies of his<br />\npredecessor. The so-called \"Bronk<br />\nPlan,' in which each student is<br />\nallowed to proceed at his own<br />\nrate of speed, will be continued.<br />\n\"Bronk just reiterated the principles of Gilman and others,' Dr.<br />\nReed says, \"It doesnt matter<br />\nwhether you call it the Goodnow<br />\nPlan, the Bronk Plan, or simply<br />\nthe Hopkins Plan.\"<br />\nBacks Biophysics<br />\nDr. Bronk was a biophysicist,<br />\nand whtn he accepted the Hopkins<br />\npresidency, he brought a number of competent biophysicists with<br />\nhim.
