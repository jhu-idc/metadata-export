We see that our worthy contemporary, the Evening<br />\nSun, laments the absence of \"intellectual freedom\" at the University of West Virginia. Now this wail, we believe, is a most<br />\nnoble one, and one that should be wailed whenever such stupidity<br />\nas was exercised at West Virginia is demonstrated. On the other<br />\nhand, however, the president of the university offered an excuse<br />\nwhich could easily find validity in many of the underlying arguments of Evening Sun editorials.<br />\nPresident Trotter said that the reason why a certain pacifist was<br />\nnot allowed to speak at West Virginia was that \"this is a Statesupported institution and too much turmoil had been caused by<br />\nthe invitation.\" Or, in other words, West Virginia is John.<br />\nSmith, taxpayer's college, and if John Smith doesn't want some<br />\none to talk at his college, that some one isn't going to talk\u2014that's<br />\nall there is to it!<br />\nThe former principle, it seems to us, is.the more commendable<br />\nof the two; intellectual freedom is a higher ideal than a slim tax<br />\nrate. Or, perhaps, this is one occasion upon which John Smith<br />\npays his money and then has nothing more to say about it!.<br />\n<br />\nTHE NAVY IS RIGHT<br />\nIt seems pre-eminently ludicrous to us that Yale should bar<br />\nBruce Caldwell from her football team because of participation<br />\nin two games during his freshman year at Brown, and expect<br />\nPrinceton to do the same thing under similar circumstances, when<br />\nthe United States Military Academy plays bona fide games with<br />\nall the leading colleges of the country with men in her line-up<br />\nplaying their seventh year of college football. If Princeton or<br />\nDartmouth were to use men who were playing their fourth year<br />\nof football, Yale should probably protest vehemently; nevertheless,<br />\nthe Army game is one of the high spots of the Eli schedule every<br />\nyear.<br />\nWe cannot blame the Navy for kicking. Why should Navy<br />\nhave to develop her material each year and go into the biggest<br />\ngame of the season against men who had been picked on AllAmerican teams before members of the Navy team were out of<br />\nhigh school? It is true that \"Biff\" 'Jones, the Army coach,<br />\nstrongly denies trying to convince star football players of the<br />\npleasures and amenities of the great Army life, but it does seem<br />\na little more than a coincidence that the bulwarks of the West<br />\nPoint elevens for the past few years have been former stars at<br />\nother colleges.<br />\nThe fault lies as much with the large colleges who comprise<br />\nthe Army schedule as it does with the Army herself. If Yale<br />\nand Notre Dame and Bucknell would insist upon Army's barring<br />\nmen who have already had one football career, Army would have<br />\nto fall into line. The Navy, acting alone, seems powerless to cause<br />\nany change. It would be, indeed, deplorable if one of the most<br />\ncolorful annual football classics should be discontinued because<br />\none of the teams insisted upon adhering to an eligibility code that<br />\ndiffered from that of every college in the country.<br />\n<br />\nThere is a delightful bit of verse, possessed of that brand of<br />\ninanity essential to the immortality of a nursery-rhyme, which\u2014<br />\nperhaps because of the insidious influence of the recent red-hot<br />\nissue of the Black and Blue Jay\u2014occurs to me whenever some<br />\nproud or disconsolate \"brother\" tells me how many men his fraternity \"got.\" It is a rhyme which the less callous readers will,<br />\nin a spirit of unavowed sentiment, associate with that time when<br />\ntheir toes were as tender,as their souls:<br />\nThis little pig went to market,<br />\nThis little pig stayed home.<br />\nThis little pig had roast beef,<br />\nThis little pig had none.<br />\nThis little pig said \"boo-hoo-hoo!\" all the way home.<br />\nSome time, when no one is watching, rehearse it\u2014big toe, next<br />\ntoe, etc. Then apply it to five freshmen, substituting a name\u2014<br />\nof course\u2014for each pig.

However, the next simile\u2014a worse one, I warn you, than the first\u2014is<br />\nalso of the barnyard variety. It is concerned with the mysteries<br />\nrelevant to the separation of the sheep and the goats. Of course,<br />\nwe have goats on the left hand and sheep on the right, but how<br />\ndo they get there? It is a matter of everlasting mystery, to one<br />\nunendowed with divine powers of selection, that the potential<br />\nfraternity men of each ensuing freshman class are apparently<br />\nautomatically distinguished from those who are (also inexplicably) not eligible. Is it by common consent of the recording<br />\nangels who have observed the lives of these poor miserable offenders that A should be sought by all fraternities\u2014and the Buccaneers\u2014while B goes home unpledged, unhonored and unsung?<br />\nOr are these cattle easily judged\u2014by the fleece, by the pound, by<br />\nthe teeth? Sheep and goats. You to the left; you to the right;<br />\nyou get a bid; you get left. The fallacy in this simile lies in the<br />\nauthor's ignorance of which is which; is the lucky freshman led<br />\nlike a sheep to slaughter\u2014or is he the goat? It has always been<br />\nmy intention to ask some sobered and sensible fraternity man,<br />\nin an upper class, to which species he belonged, but the dangerous<br />\npossibility of his being of a third\u2014and long-eared\u2014family, has<br />\ninvariably prevented my inquiry. However (here again the likeness is stretched to the breaking point, or beyond), the cattle are<br />\nrustled, lassoed, bound by a thousand threats, promises, and suggestions, and eventually each is branded with a Greek letter; Hester Prynne got much the same treatment when she won her \"A.\"<br />\nThe first little pig, he of the market trip, in all probability put<br />\nup a stall\u2014not in the market, but before he got there\u2014and after<br />\nhe went to market he thought how much better he would have<br />\ndone to go elsewhere.

But he could always tell<br />\nhis children, in later life, of the other seven bids.<br />\nHistory is kind to the fourth little pig. Perhaps he was a<br />\ncrank and didn't want a bid. More probably, no one ever knew<br />\nwhether or not he was bitterly disappointed.<br />\nAnd this little pig said \"Boo-hoo-hoo\" all the way home.

The fact that none<br />\nof them come from Europe is evidenced by the absence of any instances in which the hero is Christianized.

The second type of<br />\nframe story has to do with a demon<br />\nwho is tricked by a beautiful woman<br />\nwho is in his power.

They swarm into his brain<br />\nliterally begging to be put on paper.\"<br />\nAt times, however, as MI Feuillerat<br />\nPointed out, Shakespeare's figures<br />\nbecome too long until the effect is<br />\nlost. It is at this stage that they<br />\ndegenerate into bombast.

Why should Navy<br />\nhave to develop her material each year and go into the biggest<br />\ngame of the season against men who had been picked on AllAmerican teams before members of the Navy team were out of<br />\nhigh school? It is true that \"Biff\" 'Jones, the Army coach,<br />\nstrongly denies trying to convince star football players of the<br />\npleasures and amenities of the great Army life, but it does seem<br />\na little more than a coincidence that the bulwarks of the West<br />\nPoint elevens for the past few years have been former stars at<br />\nother colleges.<br />\nThe fault lies as much with the large colleges who comprise<br />\nthe Army schedule as it does with the Army herself. If Yale<br />\nand Notre Dame and Bucknell would insist upon Army's barring<br />\nmen who have already had one football career, Army would have<br />\nto fall into line. The Navy, acting alone, seems powerless to cause<br />\nany change. It would be, indeed, deplorable if one of the most<br />\ncolorful annual football classics should be discontinued because<br />\none of the teams insisted upon adhering to an eligibility code that<br />\ndiffered from that of every college in the country.<br /><br />\nThere is a delightful bit of verse, possessed of that brand of<br />\ninanity essential to the immortality of a nursery-rhyme, which\u2014<br />\nperhaps because of the insidious influence of the recent red-hot<br />\nissue of the Black and Blue Jay\u2014occurs to me whenever some<br />\nproud or disconsolate \"brother\" tells me how many men his fraternity \"got.\" It is a rhyme which the less callous readers will,<br />\nin a spirit of unavowed sentiment, associate with that time when<br />\ntheir toes were as tender,as their souls:<br />\nThis little pig went to market,<br />\nThis little pig stayed home.<br />\nThis little pig had roast beef,<br />\nThis little pig had none.<br />\nThis little pig said \"boo-hoo-hoo!\" all the way home.<br />\nSome time, when no one is watching, rehearse it\u2014big toe, next<br />\ntoe, etc. Then apply it to five freshmen, substituting a name\u2014<br />\nof course\u2014for each pig. Thus;<br />\nThis little(?) went Beta,<br />\nThis little (pain?) stayed home.<br />\nThis little (lion) had eight bids,<br />\nThis (poor mutt) had none.<br />\nAnd the last line may be repeated in its original form.<br />\nWhy an essay on the mysteries of fraternity-rushing should<br />\nrequire all the equipment of a pastoral is an open question. However, the next simile\u2014a worse one, I warn you, than the first\u2014is<br />\nalso of the barnyard variety. It is concerned with the mysteries<br />\nrelevant to the separation of the sheep and the goats. Of course,<br />\nwe have goats on the left hand and sheep on the right, but how<br />\ndo they get there? It is a matter of everlasting mystery, to one<br />\nunendowed with divine powers of selection, that the potential<br />\nfraternity men of each ensuing freshman class are apparently<br />\nautomatically distinguished from those who are (also inexplicably) not eligible. Is it by common consent of the recording<br />\nangels who have observed the lives of these poor miserable offenders that A should be sought by all fraternities\u2014and the Buccaneers\u2014while B goes home unpledged, unhonored and unsung?<br />\nOr are these cattle easily judged\u2014by the fleece, by the pound, by<br />\nthe teeth? Sheep and goats. You to the left; you to the right;<br />\nyou get a bid; you get left. The fallacy in this simile lies in the<br />\nauthor's ignorance of which is which; is the lucky freshman led<br />\nlike a sheep to slaughter\u2014or is he the goat? It has always been<br />\nmy intention to ask some sobered and sensible fraternity man,<br />\nin an upper class, to which species he belonged, but the dangerous<br />\npossibility of his being of a third\u2014and long-eared\u2014family, has<br />\ninvariably prevented my inquiry. However (here again the likeness is stretched to the breaking point, or beyond), the cattle are<br />\nrustled, lassoed, bound by a thousand threats, promises, and suggestions, and eventually each is branded with a Greek letter; Hester Prynne got much the same treatment when she won her \"A.\"<br />\nThe first little pig, he of the market trip, in all probability put<br />\nup a stall\u2014not in the market, but before he got there\u2014and after<br />\nhe went to market he thought how much better he would have<br />\ndone to go elsewhere. But once in market he could not get out;<br />\nin the course of time he did away with vain regrets, and became<br />\nso much ham.<br />\nThe second pig stayed home. Pathetic porker! He cut a<br />\nnine-thirty waiting for the car that never came.<br />\nHe who got eight bids unquestionably accepted the worst of<br />\nthe eight. These unworldly pigs are overwhelmed by numbers<br />\nand by the semblance of popularity. But he could always tell<br />\nhis children, in later life, of the other seven bids.<br />\nHistory is kind to the fourth little pig. Perhaps he was a<br />\ncrank and didn't want a bid. More probably, no one ever knew<br />\nwhether or not he was bitterly disappointed.<br />\nAnd this little pig said \"Boo-hoo-hoo\" all the way home. Even<br />\nin infancy, when it was represented by my own pink tiny \"tootsie,\"<br />\nI felt indescribably sorry for that little pig.<br /><br />\nWOE UNTO THOSE WHO TRY TO CRASH<br />\nTHE GATE AT HOMEWOOD, SAYS FRANK<br />\nFew Hopkins students properly<br />\nappreciate either the efficiency or<br />\nthe majesty of the Johns Hopkins<br />\narm of the law, and hence there is<br />\noccasion for another of those perennial eulogies in praise of our<br />\ndoughty Sergeant.<br />\nThis time it has to do with the<br />\nback gate at Homewood field, so<br />\nfamiliar to Hopkins students.

The second type of<br />\nframe story has to do with a demon<br />\nwho is tricked by a beautiful woman<br />\nwho is in his power.

Shakespeare<br />\ncannot contemplate an object without calling to mind a host of associations. They swarm into his brain<br />\nliterally begging to be put on paper.\"<br />\nAt times, however, as MI Feuillerat<br />\nPointed out, Shakespeare's figures<br />\nbecome too long until the effect is<br />\nlost.
