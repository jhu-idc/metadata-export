Over a two week<br />\nperiod the old system, which<br />\nconsisted of folding signs,<br />\nobstruction barrels and physical<br />\nclosures to regulate southbound<br />\nCharles Street traffic, will be<br />\nphased out to allow for an advanced and more practical<br />\nsystem.<br />\nFor several months, following a serious automobile accident in October of 1982, involving a Johns Hopkins Medical<br />\nSchool employee, the City of<br />\nBaltimore worked with the<br />\ncommunity, the Johns Hopkins<br />\nUniversity, and the Johns<br />\nHopkins Student Life Committee, chaired by Jon Lana, in<br />\norder to reduce auto-pedestrian<br />\nrelated hazards, especially at<br />\nthe section of Charles Street<br />\nbetween University Parkway<br />\nand 29th Street. In support for<br />\nthis campaign, Richard H.<br />\n<br />\nTrainor, Director of Transportation, endorsed the variable<br />\nmessage signal and sign system<br />\nin the hopes of avoiding potential accidents. With this resolution in early 1983 came<br />\nrestricted use of southbound<br />\naccess to Charles Street through<br />\na temporary traffic regulatory<br />\nsystem which was operated by<br />\nlocal police.<br />\nMore than one year after the<br />\nplanned date of operation, the<br />\n2\u00bc square foot fiber optic signs<br />\nconnected to the Office of<br />\nTransportation and Control at<br />\n414 N. Calvert Street will<br />\nautomatically adjust to accommodate southbound traffic patterns. The brightly lit signs<br />\nlocated over Charles Street, the<br />\ncritical approach lanes of<br />\nUniversity Parkway, Greenway<br />\nand 34th, 33rd, and 31st<br />\nStreets, will also allow greater<br />\nreaction times for motorists,<br />\nsince fiber optical signs are<br />\nmore readily visible at greater<br />\ndistances than are conventional<br />\ntraffic cigns. With the manual-<br />\n<br />\nly operated system, the southbound Charles Street lane will<br />\nbe open from 7-9 a.m., Monday through Friday, as well as<br />\nsouth from 33rd Street after<br />\nstadium events. Furthermore,<br />\nthe automated system will allow<br />\nadditional access at other nonscheduled times and in turn<br />\nreduce access at predesignated<br />\naccess times depending upon<br />\ntraffic flow.<br />\nThe lane control system is<br />\njust one aspect of Mayor<br />\nSchaefer's public safety program. New pedestrian signals,<br />\ncrosswalks, lane markings and<br />\nsidewalk improvements, combined with the new variable<br />\nmessage system, will help to<br />\nreduce the possibilities of autopedestrian<br />\naccidents<br />\nthroughout Baltimore, the<br />\nmayor hopes. Jon Lana, one of<br />\nthe founders of this campaign,<br />\nis optimistic about the effectiveness of this system and \"is<br />\nLarry Volz<br />\nvery pleased that the city has<br />\nOne of the new fiber optic signs that has been put up to control traffic<br />\nfulfilled its commitment to<br />\non Charles Street.

At the<br />\nsame time, Grauer defended<br />\ncolumnists in general.<br />\n\"I believe that the role of today's columnists remain invaluable,\" he said. \"I think<br />\ntheir voices are needed, and I<br />\ndon't think they're likely to be<br />\nstilled.\"<br />\nGrauer's book is a series of<br />\nprofiles of 12 well-known<br />\nsydicate columists: Jack Anderson, Russel Baker, Erma<br />\nBombeck, Jimmy Breslin,<br />\nDavid Broder, Art Buckwald,<br />\nWilliam F. Buckley, Jr., Ellen<br />\nGoodman, James J. Kilpatrick,<br />\nCarl T. Rowan, Mike Royko<br />\nand George F. Will. In addition<br />\nto writing the book, Grauer\u2014<br />\na Hopkins alumnus\u2014drew a<br />\ncaricature of the columnists<br />\nprofiled.<br />\n\"Columnists are the people<br />\nin the press we feel we actually<br />\nknow,\" Grauer said. \"They are<br />\nour friends in high places.\"<br />\nGrauer said he does not<br />\n<br />\nbelieve, as many do, that<br />\nnewspapers, and therefore columnists, are on their way out.<br />\nGrauer admitted that within the<br />\nlast few years, some major<br />\nmetropolitan newspapers have<br />\ncollapsed, but added that there<br />\nare still as many newspapers as<br />\n. there were 20 years ago.<br />\n\"If the newspaper industry is<br />\nill, it is certainly a lively invalid,\" Grauer said.<br />\nGrauer added, however, that<br />\nhe thinks it is possible fewer<br />\n\"national stars\" will emerge<br />\nfrom the columnists' ranks. He<br />\nattributed this to the fact that<br />\ncolumnists now write less frequently than they use to. Most<br />\nof today's columistis write two<br />\nor three columns a week,<br />\nwhereas many used to write<br />\neverday.<br />\nGrauer said he selected the<br />\ncolumists profiled in his book<br />\nfor a variety of reasons. He said<br />\nthey had to be very widely syndicated and well-known, and<br />\nthat he wanted geographical<br />\ndiversity. He noted that since<br />\nthere are more than 800 columnists nationwide, he had a wide<br />\nselection.<br />\n\"Each of these columnists<br />\nalso possesses a solid record of<br />\nachievement in an extremely<br />\ntough job for a very long<br />\ntime,\" Grauer said.<br />\nGrauer said that most of the<br />\ncolumnists he profiled \"hesitate<br />\nto claim any great influence.\"<br />\nHe said James Kilpatrick told<br />\nhim that he believed columns<br />\n\"probably don't have much influence, but in some cases they<br />\n<br />\nprobably have a decisive<br />\ninfluence.\"<br />\nGrauer also noted that columnists often have influence<br />\naside from their column<br />\nwriting.

The full-time staff,<br />\n<br />\nwhich is salaried, includes the<br />\ndirector, assistant director and<br />\nthree and a half counselors.<br />\nPart-time staff includes<br />\nvolunteers and persons in training. The volunteers include 20<br />\nsocial workers, psychologists,<br />\nand physicians who donate<br />\ntime.

Their<br />\ndegrees include masters in<br />\nsocial work, psychology, and<br />\nmental health.<br />\nAll part-time staff members<br />\nin training have had some experience in psychotherapy prior<br />\nto their arrival at the White<br />\nHouse.

In the meantime, we<br />\nmust assume we are dealing<br />\nwith someone who doesn't care<br />\nabout us.<br />\n<br />\nTo the Editor:<br />\n<br />\nPau-tract<br />\nHopkins Housing<br />\nOff campus housing owned by the Johns<br />\nHopkins University has been a source of<br />\nfrustration for students for years. It's rather<br />\ninteresting to note that complaints remain<br />\nfairly consistent even though the<br />\nundergraduate population is constantly<br />\nchanging.<br />\nStudents who have lived in university<br />\nhousing can present a vast array of<br />\nmaintenance horror stories, ranging from<br />\nbroken toilet seats to moldy walls.<br />\nCockroach infestation is another fringe<br />\nbenefit of McCoy Hall, in particular.<br />\nResponse to tenant gripes is painfully slow\u2014<br />\nthat is, if there is any response at all.<br />\nAnother distinctive feature of Hopkins<br />\nhousing is the confusion which results from<br />\nthe annual lottery for dwelling space.<br />\nStudents have little knowledge of potential<br />\napartments when they sign their leases. The<br />\nslide show presented by the Housing Office<br />\nis outdated, and poorly printed floor plans<br />\nrequire considerable imagination to interpret. Additionally, the codes used to identify available spaces introduce an uncomfortable element of chance to an undergraduate's choice of living quarters.<br />\nIn general, Hopkins students have encountered a significant amount of difficulty in dealing with the Housing Office. This<br />\nfact is underscored by the indifferent, even<br />\ncold, attitude students encounter when they<br />\nenter the Housing Office itself. Students<br />\nshould not feel like intruders when attempting to use a service designed for them.<br />\nHowever, undergraduates in the past have<br />\n<br />\nnot been overly effective in working with<br />\nHousing to try to alleviate these problems.<br />\nThis lack of accomplishment may be traced<br />\nto an absence of continuity on a year by year<br />\nbasis. The Student Council's Housing Committee, the most notable link between<br />\nundergraduates and housing, has a new<br />\nchairman practically every year. The prevailing attitude has been that, since so little can<br />\nbe achieved, why try?<br />\nThis year's Housing Committee appears<br />\nto have adopted an uncommon perspective,<br />\nthough. This group seems to be getting<br />\nthings done.<br />\nMeetings with Dean Norman Krueger concerning the introduction of monitors and<br />\nresidential assistants, which may curb the<br />\nrecurring vandalism in University-owned<br />\nbuildings, are steps in a positive direction.<br />\nAnother outstanding move is the proposal<br />\nto rewrite the housing lottery information<br />\npackage. And a strong suggestion has been<br />\nmade to review the method of rent payments. Students currently are required to pay<br />\nfor an entire semester which can present problems for those living on a budget. The present concern is to allow an option of paying<br />\non a monthly basis as tenants are commonly expected to do.<br />\nWe should support the Housing Committee with our input and feedback. Compared<br />\nto previous years, they have done a commendable job within the first six weeks of their<br />\nexistence.<br />\nIt's a nice change.<br />\n<br />\nIs Honor Outdated?<br />\nIn his speech to the freshmen at the beginning of the semester, President Muller called for a return to \"civility\" at Hopkins. He<br />\nwas specifically referring to his concern that<br />\nundergraduates should reestablish the Honor<br />\nCode, which was abolished by students at<br />\nHomewood over a decade ago. Muller reiterated his belief during a recent interview, yet<br />\nemphasized that such a system could only<br />\nbe brought about the students. The administration cannot \"ordain\" an Honor<br />\nCode; it can merely provide support for<br />\nundergraduates interested in doing so.<br />\nOur first reaction to this proposition is one<br />\nof doubt. Realistically, students argue an<br />\nhonor system wouldn't work at an institution such as Hopkins. Undergraduates are<br />\ntoo intense, too grade-conscious, too preprofessional to make such a proposal feasible. One may refer to a recent letter from<br />\nthe Undergraduate Ethics Board to support<br />\nthis skepticism. According to the letter, there<br />\nhas been a substantial increase in the in-<br />\n<br />\ncidence of cheating, or being caught at<br />\ncheating, at Homewood. This is a sobering<br />\nfact and the notion that an Honor Code be<br />\nintroduced to the current student population<br />\nseems foolhardy.<br />\nYet, the letter from the Ethics Board indicates something else. It indicates that the<br />\npresent system isn't working. Students are,<br />\nin fact, cheating now more than ever. They<br />\nmay be responding to the intensity of<br />\nundergraduate education at Hopkins. Or<br />\nperhaps people cheat because the system expects them to cheat. This is a disturbing<br />\nthought and something surely needs to be<br />\ndone.<br />\nAn Honor Code may not be the best solution to the absence of \"civility\" at Hopkins.<br />\nBut it is doubtful that any system would<br />\neliminate cheating altogether. An Honor<br />\nCode would give students something that is<br />\npresently lacking, however. It would give us<br />\nself-respect.<br />\n<br />\nLloyd Melnick<br />\n<br />\nI found the recent interview Pro Wrestling<br />\nwith President Muller both<br />\namusing and disturbing.

It is quite alarming that such an attitude exists<br />\nin such high circles. I wonder if<br />\nMrs. Bush's sentiments are not<br />\nshared by the Vice President<br />\nhimself. On or off the record,<br />\nthese remarks are disgraceful.<br />\nThey are, in addition, wholly<br />\nfalse. I have not seen, nor have<br />\nI heard of, Mrs. Ferraro standing in an unemployment line<br />\nor waiting for a ration of<br />\ngovernment cheese in order to<br />\nfeign poverty.<br />\n<br />\nIN THIS<br />\nCOMPUTERIZED<br />\nAGEIDONT<br />\nSEE HOW<br />\nYOU CAN SAY<br />\nAPTITUDE<br />\nIN MATH IS<br />\nSLIPPING...<br />\n<br />\nIf the remarks stem from a<br />\ndisagreement over the way two<br />\ndifferent individuals feel the<br />\ncountry should be run, then<br />\nthere is no call for one to assail<br />\nthe other. It is simply a difference of opinion. These differences should be aired in a<br />\npublic forum, such as a debate,<br />\nand should only encompass<br />\nmatters of government. The<br />\nspouses of the candidates<br />\nshould understand this and<br />\nabide by this. It is unfortunate<br />\nthat such attacks are made<br />\nupon a person's good name for<br />\nno other reason than a difference of opinion.<br />\nIt is only fear of that which<br />\nwe do not know or understand<br />\nor take the time to understand<br />\nthat promotes such jealousy,<br />\nhatred and in some cases<br />\ndiscrimination. Had Mrs. Ferraro or Mrs. Bush been of the<br />\nsame party they might have had<br />\nthe opportunity to become<br />\nfriends. Even with different<br />\npartisan affiliations that<br />\npossibility always existed,<br />\nthough it may be gone now.<br />\nWe must not fail to see that<br />\nwhich is good in those who do<br />\nnot always share our opinions.<br />\nIf that were not the case, many<br />\nof us would be friendless. Difficult as it may be to practice<br />\nwhat has just been preached, it<br />\nmust be done to preserve the integrity of our leadership and<br />\npolitical institutions.

If<br />\nthe Jays, possessors of a 7-2-3<br />\nrecord and 1-0-1 in Southwest<br />\nDivision play, manage to win<br />\nthe 3:00 contest, they and the<br />\nGettysburg Bullets will be the<br />\ndivisional representatives to the<br />\nall-conference tournament.<br />\ntie must-win situation<br />\ncomes about as a result of the<br />\nJays' September 20th tie with<br />\nGettysburg, and last week's tie<br />\nbetween the Bullets and the<br />\nGreen Terrors. The top two<br />\nteams in the Southwest Division, which also includes the<br />\nDickinson Red Devils and the<br />\nJuniata Indians, will advance.<br />\nGettysburg, with its two ties<br />\nand probable victories over<br />\nDickinson (1-4 overall) and<br />\nJuniata (0-4 overall) figures to<br />\nfinish with a 2-0-2 record. The<br />\nwinner of today's game, contigent on a win over the Red<br />\nDevils, will probably finish at<br />\n3-0-1, while the loser should be<br />\neliminated at 2-1-1. The Indians, 0-2 in division play, and<br />\nthe Red Devils, 0-0, are not expected to enter into the picture.<br />\n\"Attitude will be important<br />\nin this game,\" said Head Coach<br />\nSally Beth Anderson. \"We<br />\nhave to maintain our intensity<br />\nthrough the entire _contest.\"<br />\nThe Jays have faced tough opponents before, several from<br />\n<br />\nDivision I, but have never been<br />\nin a do-or-die situation. That<br />\nmakes for a good deal of<br />\npressure on the young team,<br />\nwhich is playing its first season<br />\nin the conference.<br />\n\"The home field advantage<br />\nshould be our big edge,\" said<br />\nsenior co-captain Karen<br />\nMcGuire. \"We're very comfortable on the turf.\" The Jays<br />\nhave posted a 4-1-1 record on<br />\nHomewood Field this season,<br />\nincluding victories in three of<br />\nfour games in the current five<br />\ngame homestand.<br />\nDespite provisions for two<br />\nten-minute overtime periods, a<br />\ntie is a common occurence in<br />\nfield hockey, and if the Jays<br />\nand Terrors play to a deadlock<br />\ntoday, the potential exists for a<br />\nthree-way tie for first place in<br />\nthe division. This would not<br />\neliminate the Jays, but it would<br />\ncertainly not win them the berth<br />\nthat a victory should clinch.<br />\nAnderson expects a playoff<br />\ngame in case of a deadlock, but<br />\nthe details have not been formalized as yet.<br />\nIf momentum is an important factor in the hocksters'<br />\nperformance this afternoon,<br />\nthen Tuesday's 5-0 victory over<br />\nHood college was an key one<br />\nfor the team's confidence.<br />\nFreshman forward Jennifer<br />\nKenoian returned to her highscoring form with her eighth<br />\nand ninth tallies of the season,<br />\nand junior co-captain Judy<br />\nSchmidt added two of her own<br />\nto extend her recent scoring<br />\nstreak.<br />\n<br />\n\"We took a lot more shots<br />\non goal than we had in the<br />\npast.\" said Anderson. \"And<br />\nwere able to set up our goals.\"<br />\nThe Jays forced the Blazer<br />\ngoalkeeper to make twelve<br />\nsaves in the effort, finally<br />\nbreaking the Hood defense with<br />\nSchmidt's goal, assisted by<br />\n<br />\nBessin at 25:20, and again by<br />\nKenoian just twenty seconds<br />\nlater.

Hopkins had six on the<br />\nday, five of which resulted in<br />\nturnovers. Amazingly, four of<br />\nthe turnovers were in the first<br />\nhalf when the Jays scored all<br />\ntwenty of their points despite<br />\nthis. According to Head Coach<br />\nJerry Pfeifer, \"we could have<br />\nbeen up by five touchdowns.\"<br />\nOn the other side of the ball,<br />\nPfeifer was very impressed with<br />\nhis defense in the first half, but<br />\ndisappointed in their eventual<br />\ncollapse. Jon Byrd led the way<br />\nin tackles, with eight solo stops<br />\n<br />\nMark Campbell<br />\n<br />\nDave Shapiro<br />\n<br />\nand 11 assisted ones, including<br />\na forced fumble and two sacks<br />\nof the quarterback. Karl Herman was close behind with<br />\nseven solo tackles and 12<br />\nassisted tackles, one sack, and<br />\na fumble recovery.<br />\nOffensively, the Jays moved<br />\nwell in the beginning, only to<br />\ncollapse in the second half<br />\nwhen the defense started to let<br />\nup points. Quarterback Mark<br />\nCampbell was nine for 13 for 91<br />\nyards and two TD's after two<br />\nquarters, but then ran into<br />\ntrouble. He still finished with<br />\ngood stats, however(13 for 25,<br />\n131 yards, no interceptions).<br />\nSteve Mitchell hauled in four<br />\nmore passes, giving him 19 for<br />\nthe year. He leads the team in<br />\nthis category, in addition to setting the pace in yards per<br />\ncatch(21.2), and touchdowns<br />\n(four, one on Saturday).<br />\nThe running game followed<br />\nthe suit of everyone else as<br />\nHopkins gained 118 yards on<br />\nthe ground, but only 20 after<br />\nthe intermission. Brad McLam<br />\nled the team in yardage with 44<br />\non 18 carries, though his fumbling problems continued as he<br />\ncoughed up the ball two times.<br />\nHe also caught three passes,<br />\nreturned five punts, and four<br />\nkickoffs, finished with an impressive sum of 204 total yards.<br />\nTony Nutter added 43 yards on<br />\nonly 10 carries, in addition to<br />\nthree pass receptions.<br />\nThe Blue Jays got the game<br />\noff to a quick start, taking on-<br />\n<br />\nly 3:49 to get on the board.<br />\nCampbell hit Mitchell in the<br />\nend zone from eight yards out<br />\nand Tom Loftus added title conversion to make it 7-0.<br />\nBefore the quarter was over,<br />\nHopkins struck again. This<br />\ntime, McLam bulled in from<br />\neight yards out for his second<br />\nscore of the year, both on the<br />\nground. Loftus hit again to put<br />\nthe lead at 14-0.<br />\nJHU moved out to a twenty<br />\npoint edge early in the second\"<br />\nquarter and the rout was seemingly on. From the Ursinus 20,<br />\nCampbell hit tight end Ed<br />\nWilliams, and the senior went<br />\nin for his first score of the year.<br />\n<br />\ntouchdown in each of the final<br />\nthree periods, the final one<br />\ncoming on a one yard's run<br />\nwith a full 10 minutes to go.<br />\nThe Jays couldn't move tough<br />\nand Ursinus was able to kill the<br />\nclock and end the game.<br />\nThe Blue Jays will try to<br />\nbounce back tomorrow as they<br />\nhost the Muhlenburg team at<br />\n1:30p.m.<br />\nJHU will have to play well to<br />\nwin, as Pfeifer feels that<br />\nMuhlenburg \"may be the best<br />\nteam in the conference.

This<br />\nyear's overwhelming turn-out<br />\nfor the Crew has started off the<br />\nseason with a bang, but has<br />\ncreated a dilemma, in that there<br />\nare eight crews (five more than<br />\nlast year) and only four shells.<br />\nThat's rowing jargon for not<br />\nenotiph eauiment. Thus.<br />\nHopkins crew launches its first<br />\n(and hopefully last) successful<br />\nfundraising campaign. President Tim Ruzan and captains<br />\nMike Book and Gillian Black<br />\nwere appalled to find that JHU<br />\nhad launched their campaign<br />\nfirst. Nevertheless, the true diehards in crew are proceeding<br />\nrelentlessly in the shadow of the<br />\nCapital Campaign. But,<br />\nenough fooling around.<br />\nThe Crew has begun to raise<br />\nfunds by selling the famous<br />\nHopkins Crew t-shirt, with the<br />\ndesign that was stolen from<br />\nthem by no less than the International Olympic Committee.<br />\nThese shirts are presently on<br />\nsale, for seven dollars.<br />\nThe upcoming Ergothon is<br />\nalso a major part of this campaign. Crew members and<br />\nspecial celebrities will engage in<br />\nno more than 30 minutes of<br />\nsheer pain and agony on a<br />\nspecial rowing machine called<br />\nan Ergometer. There are two<br />\nergometers in the weight room<br />\nof the athletic center. It looks<br />\nsimilar to a twisted bicycle and<br />\nwas created especially for practicing the fundamentals of row-<br />\n<br />\ning.Each member of the team<br />\nwill be out looking for people<br />\nto pledge money for the<br />\namount of miles he or she can<br />\nrow.

Over a two week<br />\nperiod the old system, which<br />\nconsisted of folding signs,<br />\nobstruction barrels and physical<br />\nclosures to regulate southbound<br />\nCharles Street traffic, will be<br />\nphased out to allow for an advanced and more practical<br />\nsystem.<br />\nFor several months, following a serious automobile accident in October of 1982, involving a Johns Hopkins Medical<br />\nSchool employee, the City of<br />\nBaltimore worked with the<br />\ncommunity, the Johns Hopkins<br />\nUniversity, and the Johns<br />\nHopkins Student Life Committee, chaired by Jon Lana, in<br />\norder to reduce auto-pedestrian<br />\nrelated hazards, especially at<br />\nthe section of Charles Street<br />\nbetween University Parkway<br />\nand 29th Street. In support for<br />\nthis campaign, Richard H.<br /><br />\nTrainor, Director of Transportation, endorsed the variable<br />\nmessage signal and sign system<br />\nin the hopes of avoiding potential accidents. With this resolution in early 1983 came<br />\nrestricted use of southbound<br />\naccess to Charles Street through<br />\na temporary traffic regulatory<br />\nsystem which was operated by<br />\nlocal police.<br />\nMore than one year after the<br />\nplanned date of operation, the<br />\n2\u00bc square foot fiber optic signs<br />\nconnected to the Office of<br />\nTransportation and Control at<br />\n414 N. Calvert Street will<br />\nautomatically adjust to accommodate southbound traffic patterns. The brightly lit signs<br />\nlocated over Charles Street, the<br />\ncritical approach lanes of<br />\nUniversity Parkway, Greenway<br />\nand 34th, 33rd, and 31st<br />\nStreets, will also allow greater<br />\nreaction times for motorists,<br />\nsince fiber optical signs are<br />\nmore readily visible at greater<br />\ndistances than are conventional<br />\ntraffic cigns. With the manual-<br /><br />\nly operated system, the southbound Charles Street lane will<br />\nbe open from 7-9 a.m., Monday through Friday, as well as<br />\nsouth from 33rd Street after<br />\nstadium events. Furthermore,<br />\nthe automated system will allow<br />\nadditional access at other nonscheduled times and in turn<br />\nreduce access at predesignated<br />\naccess times depending upon<br />\ntraffic flow.<br />\nThe lane control system is<br />\njust one aspect of Mayor<br />\nSchaefer's public safety program. New pedestrian signals,<br />\ncrosswalks, lane markings and<br />\nsidewalk improvements, combined with the new variable<br />\nmessage system, will help to<br />\nreduce the possibilities of autopedestrian<br />\naccidents<br />\nthroughout Baltimore, the<br />\nmayor hopes. Jon Lana, one of<br />\nthe founders of this campaign,<br />\nis optimistic about the effectiveness of this system and \"is<br />\nLarry Volz<br />\nvery pleased that the city has<br />\nOne of the new fiber optic signs that has been put up to control traffic<br />\nfulfilled its commitment to<br />\non Charles Street. The new system will replace the old manually operated<br />\npublic safety.\"<br />\nsystem for shutting down the southbound commuter lane.<br /><br />\nHopkins Alum Discusses Syndicated Columnists<br />\nby Ethan Rarick<br />\nWriting a sydicated newspaper<br />\ncolumn, according to Neil<br />\nGrauer, is a lot like being married to a nymphomaniac: \"As<br />\nsoon as you get through, you<br />\nhave to start all over again.\"<br />\nGrauer, author of Wits &amp;<br />\nSages, a recent book on nationally known columnists,<br />\nspoke at this week's Wednesday<br />\nNoon Series presentation in the<br />\nGarrett Room.<br />\nGrauer said that he believes<br />\nwriting a regular column is extremely difficult because one<br />\nmust write so often. At the<br />\nsame time, Grauer defended<br />\ncolumnists in general.<br />\n\"I believe that the role of today's columnists remain invaluable,\" he said. \"I think<br />\ntheir voices are needed, and I<br />\ndon't think they're likely to be<br />\nstilled.\"<br />\nGrauer's book is a series of<br />\nprofiles of 12 well-known<br />\nsydicate columists: Jack Anderson, Russel Baker, Erma<br />\nBombeck, Jimmy Breslin,<br />\nDavid Broder, Art Buckwald,<br />\nWilliam F. Buckley, Jr., Ellen<br />\nGoodman, James J. Kilpatrick,<br />\nCarl T. Rowan, Mike Royko<br />\nand George F. Will. In addition<br />\nto writing the book, Grauer\u2014<br />\na Hopkins alumnus\u2014drew a<br />\ncaricature of the columnists<br />\nprofiled.<br />\n\"Columnists are the people<br />\nin the press we feel we actually<br />\nknow,\" Grauer said. \"They are<br />\nour friends in high places.\"<br />\nGrauer said he does not<br /><br />\nbelieve, as many do, that<br />\nnewspapers, and therefore columnists, are on their way out.<br />\nGrauer admitted that within the<br />\nlast few years, some major<br />\nmetropolitan newspapers have<br />\ncollapsed, but added that there<br />\nare still as many newspapers as<br />\n. there were 20 years ago.<br />\n\"If the newspaper industry is<br />\nill, it is certainly a lively invalid,\" Grauer said.<br />\nGrauer added, however, that<br />\nhe thinks it is possible fewer<br />\n\"national stars\" will emerge<br />\nfrom the columnists' ranks. He<br />\nattributed this to the fact that<br />\ncolumnists now write less frequently than they use to. Most<br />\nof today's columistis write two<br />\nor three columns a week,<br />\nwhereas many used to write<br />\neverday.<br />\nGrauer said he selected the<br />\ncolumists profiled in his book<br />\nfor a variety of reasons. He said<br />\nthey had to be very widely syndicated and well-known, and<br />\nthat he wanted geographical<br />\ndiversity.

In the meantime, we<br />\nmust assume we are dealing<br />\nwith someone who doesn't care<br />\nabout us.<br /><br />\nTo the Editor:<br /><br />\nPau-tract<br />\nHopkins Housing<br />\nOff campus housing owned by the Johns<br />\nHopkins University has been a source of<br />\nfrustration for students for years. It's rather<br />\ninteresting to note that complaints remain<br />\nfairly consistent even though the<br />\nundergraduate population is constantly<br />\nchanging.<br />\nStudents who have lived in university<br />\nhousing can present a vast array of<br />\nmaintenance horror stories, ranging from<br />\nbroken toilet seats to moldy walls.<br />\nCockroach infestation is another fringe<br />\nbenefit of McCoy Hall, in particular.<br />\nResponse to tenant gripes is painfully slow\u2014<br />\nthat is, if there is any response at all.<br />\nAnother distinctive feature of Hopkins<br />\nhousing is the confusion which results from<br />\nthe annual lottery for dwelling space.<br />\nStudents have little knowledge of potential<br />\napartments when they sign their leases. The<br />\nslide show presented by the Housing Office<br />\nis outdated, and poorly printed floor plans<br />\nrequire considerable imagination to interpret. Additionally, the codes used to identify available spaces introduce an uncomfortable element of chance to an undergraduate's choice of living quarters.<br />\nIn general, Hopkins students have encountered a significant amount of difficulty in dealing with the Housing Office. This<br />\nfact is underscored by the indifferent, even<br />\ncold, attitude students encounter when they<br />\nenter the Housing Office itself. Students<br />\nshould not feel like intruders when attempting to use a service designed for them.<br />\nHowever, undergraduates in the past have<br /><br />\nnot been overly effective in working with<br />\nHousing to try to alleviate these problems.<br />\nThis lack of accomplishment may be traced<br />\nto an absence of continuity on a year by year<br />\nbasis. The Student Council's Housing Committee, the most notable link between<br />\nundergraduates and housing, has a new<br />\nchairman practically every year. The prevailing attitude has been that, since so little can<br />\nbe achieved, why try?<br />\nThis year's Housing Committee appears<br />\nto have adopted an uncommon perspective,<br />\nthough. This group seems to be getting<br />\nthings done.<br />\nMeetings with Dean Norman Krueger concerning the introduction of monitors and<br />\nresidential assistants, which may curb the<br />\nrecurring vandalism in University-owned<br />\nbuildings, are steps in a positive direction.<br />\nAnother outstanding move is the proposal<br />\nto rewrite the housing lottery information<br />\npackage. And a strong suggestion has been<br />\nmade to review the method of rent payments. Students currently are required to pay<br />\nfor an entire semester which can present problems for those living on a budget. The present concern is to allow an option of paying<br />\non a monthly basis as tenants are commonly expected to do.<br />\nWe should support the Housing Committee with our input and feedback. Compared<br />\nto previous years, they have done a commendable job within the first six weeks of their<br />\nexistence.<br />\nIt's a nice change.<br /><br />\nIs Honor Outdated?<br />\nIn his speech to the freshmen at the beginning of the semester, President Muller called for a return to \"civility\" at Hopkins. He<br />\nwas specifically referring to his concern that<br />\nundergraduates should reestablish the Honor<br />\nCode, which was abolished by students at<br />\nHomewood over a decade ago. Muller reiterated his belief during a recent interview, yet<br />\nemphasized that such a system could only<br />\nbe brought about the students. The administration cannot \"ordain\" an Honor<br />\nCode; it can merely provide support for<br />\nundergraduates interested in doing so.<br />\nOur first reaction to this proposition is one<br />\nof doubt. Realistically, students argue an<br />\nhonor system wouldn't work at an institution such as Hopkins. Undergraduates are<br />\ntoo intense, too grade-conscious, too preprofessional to make such a proposal feasible. One may refer to a recent letter from<br />\nthe Undergraduate Ethics Board to support<br />\nthis skepticism. According to the letter, there<br />\nhas been a substantial increase in the in-<br /><br />\ncidence of cheating, or being caught at<br />\ncheating, at Homewood. This is a sobering<br />\nfact and the notion that an Honor Code be<br />\nintroduced to the current student population<br />\nseems foolhardy.<br />\nYet, the letter from the Ethics Board indicates something else. It indicates that the<br />\npresent system isn't working. Students are,<br />\nin fact, cheating now more than ever. They<br />\nmay be responding to the intensity of<br />\nundergraduate education at Hopkins. Or<br />\nperhaps people cheat because the system expects them to cheat. This is a disturbing<br />\nthought and something surely needs to be<br />\ndone.<br />\nAn Honor Code may not be the best solution to the absence of \"civility\" at Hopkins.<br />\nBut it is doubtful that any system would<br />\neliminate cheating altogether. An Honor<br />\nCode would give students something that is<br />\npresently lacking, however. It would give us<br />\nself-respect.<br /><br />\nLloyd Melnick<br /><br />\nI found the recent interview Pro Wrestling<br />\nwith President Muller both<br />\namusing and disturbing.

The wife of Vice President George Bush made a comment in the presence of<br />\nreporters in which she said that<br />\nshe and her husband were content with their social position<br />\nand that they live comfortably,<br />\nbut that they don't \"pretend to<br />\nbe poor like that four million<br />\ndollar...I can't say it but it<br />\nrhymes with rich.\"<br />\nMrs. Bush, who thought her<br />\nremarks were to be \"off the<br />\nrecord,\" later apologized to<br />\nMrs. Ferraro, but told reporters<br />\nthe word which she could not<br />\nthen state was \"witch.\" It was<br />\nin extremely poor taste to say<br />\nsuch a thing even if \"witch\"<br />\nwas truly the word implied.<br />\nSome would accuse me of<br />\nnit-picking by discussing this<br />\ntopic, but something as simple<br />\nas good taste or courtesy bids<br />\nme continue. It is quite alarming that such an attitude exists<br />\nin such high circles. I wonder if<br />\nMrs. Bush's sentiments are not<br />\nshared by the Vice President<br />\nhimself. On or off the record,<br />\nthese remarks are disgraceful.<br />\nThey are, in addition, wholly<br />\nfalse. I have not seen, nor have<br />\nI heard of, Mrs. Ferraro standing in an unemployment line<br />\nor waiting for a ration of<br />\ngovernment cheese in order to<br />\nfeign poverty.<br /><br />\nIN THIS<br />\nCOMPUTERIZED<br />\nAGEIDONT<br />\nSEE HOW<br />\nYOU CAN SAY<br />\nAPTITUDE<br />\nIN MATH IS<br />\nSLIPPING...<br /><br />\nIf the remarks stem from a<br />\ndisagreement over the way two<br />\ndifferent individuals feel the<br />\ncountry should be run, then<br />\nthere is no call for one to assail<br />\nthe other. It is simply a difference of opinion. These differences should be aired in a<br />\npublic forum, such as a debate,<br />\nand should only encompass<br />\nmatters of government. The<br />\nspouses of the candidates<br />\nshould understand this and<br />\nabide by this. It is unfortunate<br />\nthat such attacks are made<br />\nupon a person's good name for<br />\nno other reason than a difference of opinion.<br />\nIt is only fear of that which<br />\nwe do not know or understand<br />\nor take the time to understand<br />\nthat promotes such jealousy,<br />\nhatred and in some cases<br />\ndiscrimination. Had Mrs. Ferraro or Mrs. Bush been of the<br />\nsame party they might have had<br />\nthe opportunity to become<br />\nfriends. Even with different<br />\npartisan affiliations that<br />\npossibility always existed,<br />\nthough it may be gone now.<br />\nWe must not fail to see that<br />\nwhich is good in those who do<br />\nnot always share our opinions.<br />\nIf that were not the case, many<br />\nof us would be friendless.

The top two<br />\nteams in the Southwest Division, which also includes the<br />\nDickinson Red Devils and the<br />\nJuniata Indians, will advance.<br />\nGettysburg, with its two ties<br />\nand probable victories over<br />\nDickinson (1-4 overall) and<br />\nJuniata (0-4 overall) figures to<br />\nfinish with a 2-0-2 record. The<br />\nwinner of today's game, contigent on a win over the Red<br />\nDevils, will probably finish at<br />\n3-0-1, while the loser should be<br />\neliminated at 2-1-1.

Hopkins had six on the<br />\nday, five of which resulted in<br />\nturnovers. Amazingly, four of<br />\nthe turnovers were in the first<br />\nhalf when the Jays scored all<br />\ntwenty of their points despite<br />\nthis. According to Head Coach<br />\nJerry Pfeifer, \"we could have<br />\nbeen up by five touchdowns.\"<br />\nOn the other side of the ball,<br />\nPfeifer was very impressed with<br />\nhis defense in the first half, but<br />\ndisappointed in their eventual<br />\ncollapse.

Karl Herman was close behind with<br />\nseven solo tackles and 12<br />\nassisted tackles, one sack, and<br />\na fumble recovery.<br />\nOffensively, the Jays moved<br />\nwell in the beginning, only to<br />\ncollapse in the second half<br />\nwhen the defense started to let<br />\nup points. Quarterback Mark<br />\nCampbell was nine for 13 for 91<br />\nyards and two TD's after two<br />\nquarters, but then ran into<br />\ntrouble. He still finished with<br />\ngood stats, however(13 for 25,<br />\n131 yards, no interceptions).<br />\nSteve Mitchell hauled in four<br />\nmore passes, giving him 19 for<br />\nthe year. He leads the team in<br />\nthis category, in addition to setting the pace in yards per<br />\ncatch(21.2), and touchdowns<br />\n(four, one on Saturday).<br />\nThe running game followed<br />\nthe suit of everyone else as<br />\nHopkins gained 118 yards on<br />\nthe ground, but only 20 after<br />\nthe intermission. Brad McLam<br />\nled the team in yardage with 44<br />\non 18 carries, though his fumbling problems continued as he<br />\ncoughed up the ball two times.<br />\nHe also caught three passes,<br />\nreturned five punts, and four<br />\nkickoffs, finished with an impressive sum of 204 total yards.<br />\nTony Nutter added 43 yards on<br />\nonly 10 carries, in addition to<br />\nthree pass receptions.<br />\nThe Blue Jays got the game<br />\noff to a quick start, taking on-<br /><br />\nly 3:49 to get on the board.<br />\nCampbell hit Mitchell in the<br />\nend zone from eight yards out<br />\nand Tom Loftus added title conversion to make it 7-0.<br />\nBefore the quarter was over,<br />\nHopkins struck again. This<br />\ntime, McLam bulled in from<br />\neight yards out for his second<br />\nscore of the year, both on the<br />\nground.

This<br />\nyear's overwhelming turn-out<br />\nfor the Crew has started off the<br />\nseason with a bang, but has<br />\ncreated a dilemma, in that there<br />\nare eight crews (five more than<br />\nlast year) and only four shells.<br />\nThat's rowing jargon for not<br />\nenotiph eauiment. Thus.<br />\nHopkins crew launches its first<br />\n(and hopefully last) successful<br />\nfundraising campaign.

Nevertheless, the true diehards in crew are proceeding<br />\nrelentlessly in the shadow of the<br />\nCapital Campaign. But,<br />\nenough fooling around.<br />\nThe Crew has begun to raise<br />\nfunds by selling the famous<br />\nHopkins Crew t-shirt, with the<br />\ndesign that was stolen from<br />\nthem by no less than the International Olympic Committee.<br />\nThese shirts are presently on<br />\nsale, for seven dollars.<br />\nThe upcoming Ergothon is<br />\nalso a major part of this campaign. Crew members and<br />\nspecial celebrities will engage in<br />\nno more than 30 minutes of<br />\nsheer pain and agony on a<br />\nspecial rowing machine called<br />\nan Ergometer. There are two<br />\nergometers in the weight room<br />\nof the athletic center.
