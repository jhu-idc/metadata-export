Even the<br />\nDemocratic primary in<br />\nSeptember, which usually<br />\nfeatures more than a few close<br />\nraces, attracted scant interest.<br />\nFour reasons account for this<br />\nsituation. First, the people of the<br />\ncity believe that Mayor William<br />\nDonald Schaefer has indeed done<br />\na good job during his first term.<br />\nMoreover, the Mayor faced little<br />\nopposition in the primary, as<br />\nexpected, permitting him to keep<br />\nhis confident image intact. To be<br />\nsure, Schaefer has made a good<br />\nshowing as the City's number one<br />\ncheerleader\u2014rushing from Italian<br />\nfestivals to Spanish fiestas.<br />\nHowever, his concrete<br />\ncontributions are not nearly as<br />\nobvious. The lack of candidates<br />\nhas allowed Schaefer to escape<br />\neither defending his programs or<br />\nannouncing new objectives.<br />\nThe Mayor's opponer.et is an<br />\nunknown 41--year-old<br />\nhousewife\u2014Claudette Chandler.<br />\nThe ex-schoolteacher's efforts<br />\nhave drawn little notice, though<br />\nshe would stand a slim chance of<br />\nwinning in a municipality where<br />\nvoter registration runs six to one<br />\nDemocrat, even if she received<br />\ngreater publicity.<br />\nThe contest for City Council<br />\nPresident is somewhat more<br />\ninteresting. Walter Orlinslcy, a<br />\nJohns Hopkins graduate and<br />\nformer epicurean supreme, won a<br />\nclear-cut victory in the primary.<br />\nHis opponent, Reverend Mariom<br />\nC. Bascom, has attracted<br />\nsignificant attention because of<br />\nhis background as a community<br />\nleader and his vigorous campaign<br />\nstressing racial unity. Still,<br />\nOrlinsky should prevail easily.<br />\nHyman Pressman is running<br />\nuncontested- for the<br />\nComptroller's post. Pressman, the<br />\nself proclaimed \"watch dog\" of<br />\nthe Baltimore City ledger, writes<br />\n<br />\nperhaps the most amusing poetry<br />\nthis side of Ali. His victory<br />\nparties which are usually assured,<br />\nrank as the best among the local<br />\npoliticos.<br />\nOnly two City Council<br />\ndistricts seem to warrant general<br />\nelection interest. The second<br />\ndistrict, which encompasses<br />\nHopkins, will probably send<br />\nClarence Burns, Mary Pat Clarke,<br />\nand Nathan C. Irby to the<br />\nCouncil.

A.<br />\nReeves, can defeat one of the<br />\nthree Democratic nominees. In<br />\nthe primary campaign, Reeves<br />\nfailed to gain a finalist slot on the<br />\nDemocratic ticket due in part to<br />\nthe fact that another participant<br />\nwith the same last name was<br />\nincluded on the ballot at the<br />\nlast moment. Since that time, he<br />\nhas waged a vigorous battle in the<br />\nhope that he can get enough<br />\nvotes from the West and<br />\nNorthwest Baltimore Black<br />\ncommunity to produce a victory.<br />\n<br />\nRev.

New real estate purchases<br />\nconstitute a financial risk in a strapped economy and during<br />\nan era when student enrollments and preferences remain<br />\nunstable.

Many students presently<br />\nlive in the surrounding apartment houses, despite the lack of<br />\na Hopkins crest above the entrances. And as anyone familiar<br />\nwith the University's housing policies knows, rents in such<br />\nfacilities will certainly skyrocket once Hopkins appropriates<br />\nthem.<br />\nThus, we urge University officials to employ the better<br />\npart of valor in reacting to the current student demands for<br />\nHopkins and refrain from pursuing courses of action which<br />\nmay jeopardize the school financially and in its relations with campus with his presence, Mr.<br />\nthe community.

It was<br />\ninteresting to see how Gregory<br />\ntried to resolve this tension.<br />\nAfter establishing at<br />\natmosphere of anxiety with his<br />\ninitial CIA crack and a hint that<br />\n\"The Company\" indeed had<br />\nrepresentatives right there in<br />\nShriver Hall last Thursday night,<br />\nGregory relaxed and told a few<br />\ninnocuous Jaws jokes (e.g. \"my<br />\ncousin's so afraid of being bitten<br />\nhe hasn't been to the toilet in six<br />\nmonths\"). Americans are afraid<br />\nof the wrong things; the state of<br />\nthe economy deserves more<br />\nthought than killer sharks.<br />\nWorking the theme of high<br />\nprices, Gregory then launched<br />\ninto a wildly funny comic<br />\nfantasy of the coming sugar<br />\npanic: sugar junkies hanging out<br />\n<br />\non street corners carrying coffee<br />\ncups, trying to get a fix; a new<br />\nbreed of ruthless cop\u2014the<br />\nsugar-buster\u2014with his fearsome<br />\ncockroach assistants trained to<br />\ndetect sugar in a parallel to<br />\nmarijuana-sniffing canines<br />\ncurrently employed by the Freds.<br />\nI waited for the inevitable George<br />\nCarlin line (\"sugar's so expensive<br />\nnow they're cuttin' it with horse<br />\nin the A & P\"), but Gregory<br />\ndidn't use it. When you reach a<br />\ncertain level in the profession,<br />\nyou don't steal from other<br />\ncomedians.<br />\nThere followed a digression on<br />\nthat legendary figure of ghetto<br />\nfolklore: the cockroach (\"the<br />\nfirst time I was called nigger was<br />\nby a cockroach; you sprayed 'em<br />\nwith Black Flag and it just got<br />\n'em high'.). They audience loved<br />\nit, but where was all this leading?<br />\nTo yet more familiar ground: the<br />\nmocking of racial stereotypes and<br />\ndiscredited politicians (\"Nixon<br />\nwas a po' white boy who stole<br />\ntoo much too fast\" whereas<br />\n\"when we gets the shopping bag<br />\nfull, we quit\").<br />\nThe the, politician theme<br />\nbrought up a serious concern of<br />\nGregory's. He believes the<br />\nassassinations of J.F.K., Malcolm<br />\nX, R.F.K., Martin Luther King,<br />\nJr., Mrs. Martin Luther King, Sr.,<br />\nas well as the attempts on George<br />\nWallace and Gerald Ford were all<br />\nthe result of conspiracies or one<br />\nbig conspiracy. Patty Hearst fit in<br />\nthere somewhere, too. I'm<br />\nlumping all these events together<br />\nin a vague manner, simply<br />\nbecause that's what Gregory did<br />\nin his presentation here. A more<br />\nbrutal commentator than myself<br />\nwould call this view paranoid; I'll<br />\nsuspend judgment until I see<br />\nGregory's evidence. After all, the<br />\nevents of the last decade and a<br />\nhalf in this country have divested<br />\n<br />\nthat word \"paranoid\" of most,if<br />\nnot all, of its meaning. Gregory<br />\ncut short his tangent in<br />\nmid-course; he said he didn't<br />\nhave time to go into the<br />\nassassination controversy in<br />\ndetail but gave an address to<br />\nwrite to for more information.<br />\nThe assassination references<br />\nmarked the end of the laughs.<br />\nGregory was angry and serious<br />\nnow; he had started out funny<br />\nwith the anger subdued. One now<br />\nrealized (if one was not already<br />\nfamiliar with Gregory's outlook)<br />\nthat the notion of a big<br />\nConspiracy is central to his world<br />\nview, and that American<br />\ncorporations seemed to be at the<br />\nheart of this Conspiracy to<br />\nstarve, to hoard, to poison, to<br />\nmalnourish, to deceive, to<br />\nconceal. And the American<br />\npublic, out of despairing<br />\nresignation or mindless<br />\ncomplacency, refuses to<br />\nacknowledge the existence of the<br />\nConspiracy, let alone to fight it.<br />\n\"The whole country's gone stone<br />\ncrazy,\" Gregory lamented.<br />\n\"We're locked into a death<br />\nsyndrome.\"<br />\n<br />\nlarge portion of the world's food<br />\nsupply out of concern for their<br />\nown profits. This priviliged few,<br />\nhe claims, constitute a genuine<br />\nruling class, controlling the<br />\ngovernment, formulating social<br />\npolicy, and generally engineering<br />\n\"the Conspiracy.\" \"The rest of<br />\nyou white folks are just niggers<br />\nto them.\"<br />\n\"Y'all got a big job. Turn this<br />\nthing around,\" Gregory urged,<br />\nleaving the audience with some<br />\nhope that the Conspiracy can still<br />\nbe stopped. But how? Gregory<br />\nwaited until the last three<br />\nminutes of his presentation to<br />\nsketch his solutions to the hunger<br />\nproblem. Before hearing his ideas<br />\nfor feeding the masses, the<br />\naudience was first treated to his<br />\ncritique of colleges and the<br />\nmorality of today's college<br />\nstudents.(Shades of Agnew!)<br />\n\"What's this institution all<br />\nabout?\" he asked rhetorically,<br />\nthen elaborated. \"You walk past<br />\nlive human beings to go to a<br />\nlibrary and read a dead<br />\nbook\u2014and you pay for it.\"<br />\nCollege students, to Gregory are<br />\nno less complacent and selfish<br />\nInjustice<br />\nthan the rest of the population.<br />\nGregory does not advocate \"Smoking pot is not an<br />\nbirth control as a means of anti-system act! Who supplies it<br />\nsolving the hunger problem. He `.o you, punk?\" The Conspiracy,<br />\nto make students\u2014potential<br />\nsees a shortage of justice, not a<br />\nsuperfluity of people, as the revolutionaries\u2014more passive, of<br />\ncause of the problem. In his view course. Yet Gregory is depending<br />\nof the situation in India\u2014based on this hedonistic group which<br />\non a report he claimed the U.N. he chides for its lack of<br />\nitself had tried to suppress-65% self-discipline and commitment<br />\nof the grain there is consumed by to \"do the job,\" to \"turn this<br />\nrodents. \"The problem is too thing around.\"<br />\nWhat after all the charisma,<br />\nmany rodents, not too many<br />\nIndians.\" This perspective was wit, anger, and rhetoric did<br />\nprobably novel to most of the Gregory have to advocate? It<br />\nboiled down to fasting one day a<br />\ncrowd.<br />\nAccording to Gregory, week, growing your own food,<br />\n\"There's a handful of rich supporting food co-operatives<br />\naristocratic white folks running and UNICEF, and\u2014get<br />\nthis country,\" who manipulate a this\u2014agitating for reform of the<br />\n<br />\nnation's food policy within the<br />\nexisting political system. \"We<br />\nneed federal legislation to<br />\nsubsidize the eater; we've been<br />\nsubsidizing the farmer.\" One<br />\nwonders how Gregory, with his<br />\nview of a Conspiracy controlling<br />\nthe government, can seriously<br />\nexpect the federal legislature to<br />\ndo anything to solve the hunger<br />\nproblem. After all, isn't Congress<br />\neither part or puppet of the<br />\nconspiratorial power structure he<br />\npostulated? Gregory's remedies,<br />\nvague, individualist, voluntaristic,<br />\npiecemeal, and tepid, are no<br />\nmatch for the problem he<br />\noutlined. His plan for selling<br />\nbasic staples like beans and rice<br />\nfor ten cents a 'pound and<br />\nsubsidizing the producers is<br />\nwroth exploring, but what if the<br />\nCongress refuses to pass the<br />\nenabling laws? After all, our<br />\nChief Executive not so long ago<br />\nresponded to hundreds of<br />\nthousands of people marching on<br />\nWashington to end the Vietnam<br />\nWar by watching a football game<br />\non the tube.<br />\nGregory urged his Hopkins<br />\naudience to write to him at PO<br />\nBox 266 Plymouth,<br />\nMassachusetts 02360 for more<br />\ninformation about how to<br />\nsurvive, how to discipline one's<br />\nself, and how to feed the hungry.<br />\nI'm certainly going to write to<br />\nhim, to see if he has a more<br />\nnherent program than the one<br />\nhe presented here. For all his<br />\nconcern and sincerity, despite the<br />\nbrilliant insights in his humor,<br />\nDick Gregory as an economist<br />\nand political analyst leaves much<br />\nto be desired.<br />\nMy views are probably not in<br />\nconcordance with those of most<br />\nof the audience, which responded<br />\nwith great enthusiasm to<br />\nGregory's lecture. Perhaps I<br />\nmissed something.<br />\n<br />\n\fpage 6/news-letter/november 4, 1975<br />\n<br />\nf<br />\n<br />\n\"ALL YOU CAN EAT\" PANCAKE BREAKFAST<br />\nNOV. 9 - 10:00 AM to 2 PM - LEVERING<br />\nPROCEEDS TO TUITION RELIEF FUND<br />\n<br />\nStudents '2.00<br />\nOthers '2.50<br />\n<br />\n41111. .1101.

Even the<br />\nDemocratic primary in<br />\nSeptember, which usually<br />\nfeatures more than a few close<br />\nraces, attracted scant interest.<br />\nFour reasons account for this<br />\nsituation.

Walter Orlinslcy, a<br />\nJohns Hopkins graduate and<br />\nformer epicurean supreme, won a<br />\nclear-cut victory in the primary.<br />\nHis opponent, Reverend Mariom<br />\nC. Bascom, has attracted<br />\nsignificant attention because of<br />\nhis background as a community<br />\nleader and his vigorous campaign<br />\nstressing racial unity.

Gregory made that<br />\naccusation right from the start:<br />\n\"You know, I like to work this<br />\nclose to CIA headquarters\u2014that<br />\nway those dudes can't get<br />\ntraveling expenses.\" So there is<br />\none advantage to being in<br />\nBaltimore after all\u2014if you<br />\nhappen to be Dick Gregory.<br />\nThere's nothing funny about<br />\npeople starving. Dick Gregory is a<br />\nsocial activist working to alleviate<br />\nthe hunger problem in the United<br />\nStates and the rest of the world.<br />\nHe is also a humorist\u2014one<br />\npossessed with that rarest of all<br />\ngifts\u2014the ability to stand in front<br />\nof a large group of people and<br />\nmake them laugh. He is<br />\napparently unwilling to give up<br />\nhumor in his effort to raise<br />\npeople's consciousness of an issue<br />\nso important and so horrifying<br />\nthat it would, one might think,<br />\npreclude humor. It was<br />\ninteresting to see how Gregory<br />\ntried to resolve this tension.<br />\nAfter establishing at<br />\natmosphere of anxiety with his<br />\ninitial CIA crack and a hint that<br />\n\"The Company\" indeed had<br />\nrepresentatives right there in<br />\nShriver Hall last Thursday night,<br />\nGregory relaxed and told a few<br />\ninnocuous Jaws jokes (e.g. \"my<br />\ncousin's so afraid of being bitten<br />\nhe hasn't been to the toilet in six<br />\nmonths\"). Americans are afraid<br />\nof the wrong things; the state of<br />\nthe economy deserves more<br />\nthought than killer sharks.<br />\nWorking the theme of high<br />\nprices, Gregory then launched<br />\ninto a wildly funny comic<br />\nfantasy of the coming sugar<br />\npanic: sugar junkies hanging out<br /><br />\non street corners carrying coffee<br />\ncups, trying to get a fix; a new<br />\nbreed of ruthless cop\u2014the<br />\nsugar-buster\u2014with his fearsome<br />\ncockroach assistants trained to<br />\ndetect sugar in a parallel to<br />\nmarijuana-sniffing canines<br />\ncurrently employed by the Freds.<br />\nI waited for the inevitable George<br />\nCarlin line (\"sugar's so expensive<br />\nnow they're cuttin' it with horse<br />\nin the A &amp; P\"), but Gregory<br />\ndidn't use it. When you reach a<br />\ncertain level in the profession,<br />\nyou don't steal from other<br />\ncomedians.<br />\nThere followed a digression on<br />\nthat legendary figure of ghetto<br />\nfolklore: the cockroach (\"the<br />\nfirst time I was called nigger was<br />\nby a cockroach; you sprayed 'em<br />\nwith Black Flag and it just got<br />\n'em high'.). They audience loved<br />\nit, but where was all this leading?<br />\nTo yet more familiar ground: the<br />\nmocking of racial stereotypes and<br />\ndiscredited politicians (\"Nixon<br />\nwas a po' white boy who stole<br />\ntoo much too fast\" whereas<br />\n\"when we gets the shopping bag<br />\nfull, we quit\").<br />\nThe the, politician theme<br />\nbrought up a serious concern of<br />\nGregory's. He believes the<br />\nassassinations of J.F.K., Malcolm<br />\nX, R.F.K., Martin Luther King,<br />\nJr., Mrs. Martin Luther King, Sr.,<br />\nas well as the attempts on George<br />\nWallace and Gerald Ford were all<br />\nthe result of conspiracies or one<br />\nbig conspiracy. Patty Hearst fit in<br />\nthere somewhere, too. I'm<br />\nlumping all these events together<br />\nin a vague manner, simply<br />\nbecause that's what Gregory did<br />\nin his presentation here. A more<br />\nbrutal commentator than myself<br />\nwould call this view paranoid; I'll<br />\nsuspend judgment until I see<br />\nGregory's evidence. After all, the<br />\nevents of the last decade and a<br />\nhalf in this country have divested<br /><br />\nthat word \"paranoid\" of most,if<br />\nnot all, of its meaning. Gregory<br />\ncut short his tangent in<br />\nmid-course; he said he didn't<br />\nhave time to go into the<br />\nassassination controversy in<br />\ndetail but gave an address to<br />\nwrite to for more information.<br />\nThe assassination references<br />\nmarked the end of the laughs.<br />\nGregory was angry and serious<br />\nnow; he had started out funny<br />\nwith the anger subdued. One now<br />\nrealized (if one was not already<br />\nfamiliar with Gregory's outlook)<br />\nthat the notion of a big<br />\nConspiracy is central to his world<br />\nview, and that American<br />\ncorporations seemed to be at the<br />\nheart of this Conspiracy to<br />\nstarve, to hoard, to poison, to<br />\nmalnourish, to deceive, to<br />\nconceal. And the American<br />\npublic, out of despairing<br />\nresignation or mindless<br />\ncomplacency, refuses to<br />\nacknowledge the existence of the<br />\nConspiracy, let alone to fight it.<br />\n\"The whole country's gone stone<br />\ncrazy,\" Gregory lamented.<br />\n\"We're locked into a death<br />\nsyndrome.\"<br /><br />\nlarge portion of the world's food<br />\nsupply out of concern for their<br />\nown profits. This priviliged few,<br />\nhe claims, constitute a genuine<br />\nruling class, controlling the<br />\ngovernment, formulating social<br />\npolicy, and generally engineering<br />\n\"the Conspiracy.\" \"The rest of<br />\nyou white folks are just niggers<br />\nto them.\"<br />\n\"Y'all got a big job. Turn this<br />\nthing around,\" Gregory urged,<br />\nleaving the audience with some<br />\nhope that the Conspiracy can still<br />\nbe stopped. But how? Gregory<br />\nwaited until the last three<br />\nminutes of his presentation to<br />\nsketch his solutions to the hunger<br />\nproblem. Before hearing his ideas<br />\nfor feeding the masses, the<br />\naudience was first treated to his<br />\ncritique of colleges and the<br />\nmorality of today's college<br />\nstudents.(Shades of Agnew!)<br />\n\"What's this institution all<br />\nabout?\" he asked rhetorically,<br />\nthen elaborated. \"You walk past<br />\nlive human beings to go to a<br />\nlibrary and read a dead<br />\nbook\u2014and you pay for it.\"<br />\nCollege students, to Gregory are<br />\nno less complacent and selfish<br />\nInjustice<br />\nthan the rest of the population.<br />\nGregory does not advocate \"Smoking pot is not an<br />\nbirth control as a means of anti-system act! Who supplies it<br />\nsolving the hunger problem. He `.o you, punk?\" The Conspiracy,<br />\nto make students\u2014potential<br />\nsees a shortage of justice, not a<br />\nsuperfluity of people, as the revolutionaries\u2014more passive, of<br />\ncause of the problem. In his view course. Yet Gregory is depending<br />\nof the situation in India\u2014based on this hedonistic group which<br />\non a report he claimed the U.N. he chides for its lack of<br />\nitself had tried to suppress-65% self-discipline and commitment<br />\nof the grain there is consumed by to \"do the job,\" to \"turn this<br />\nrodents. \"The problem is too thing around.\"<br />\nWhat after all the charisma,<br />\nmany rodents, not too many<br />\nIndians.\" This perspective was wit, anger, and rhetoric did<br />\nprobably novel to most of the Gregory have to advocate? It<br />\nboiled down to fasting one day a<br />\ncrowd.<br />\nAccording to Gregory, week, growing your own food,<br />\n\"There's a handful of rich supporting food co-operatives<br />\naristocratic white folks running and UNICEF, and\u2014get<br />\nthis country,\" who manipulate a this\u2014agitating for reform of the<br /><br />\nnation's food policy within the<br />\nexisting political system. \"We<br />\nneed federal legislation to<br />\nsubsidize the eater; we've been<br />\nsubsidizing the farmer.\" One<br />\nwonders how Gregory, with his<br />\nview of a Conspiracy controlling<br />\nthe government, can seriously<br />\nexpect the federal legislature to<br />\ndo anything to solve the hunger<br />\nproblem. After all, isn't Congress<br />\neither part or puppet of the<br />\nconspiratorial power structure he<br />\npostulated? Gregory's remedies,<br />\nvague, individualist, voluntaristic,<br />\npiecemeal, and tepid, are no<br />\nmatch for the problem he<br />\noutlined. His plan for selling<br />\nbasic staples like beans and rice<br />\nfor ten cents a 'pound and<br />\nsubsidizing the producers is<br />\nwroth exploring, but what if the<br />\nCongress refuses to pass the<br />\nenabling laws? After all, our<br />\nChief Executive not so long ago<br />\nresponded to hundreds of<br />\nthousands of people marching on<br />\nWashington to end the Vietnam<br />\nWar by watching a football game<br />\non the tube.<br />\nGregory urged his Hopkins<br />\naudience to write to him at PO<br />\nBox 266 Plymouth,<br />\nMassachusetts 02360 for more<br />\ninformation about how to<br />\nsurvive, how to discipline one's<br />\nself, and how to feed the hungry.<br />\nI'm certainly going to write to<br />\nhim, to see if he has a more<br />\nnherent program than the one<br />\nhe presented here. For all his<br />\nconcern and sincerity, despite the<br />\nbrilliant insights in his humor,<br />\nDick Gregory as an economist<br />\nand political analyst leaves much<br />\nto be desired.<br />\nMy views are probably not in<br />\nconcordance with those of most<br />\nof the audience, which responded<br />\nwith great enthusiasm to<br />\nGregory's lecture.
