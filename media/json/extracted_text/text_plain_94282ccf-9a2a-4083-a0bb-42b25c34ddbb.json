However, in 1886 the tenth anniversary of the opening of the institution was regarded as an important<br />\nmilestone and was celebrated with<br />\nconsiderable seriousness. As part of<br />\nthis celebration a luncheon was held<br />\nin the gymnasium, attended by faculty, students, and alumni, and, of<br />\ncourse, enlivened by speeches. After<br />\nthe speaking Associate Professor<br />\nCraig, one of the most brilliant of<br />\nthat notable group of original Fellows, moved \"that an organization of<br />\ngraduates of the University be<br />\nformed.\" His motion was carried and<br />\na committee of ten was appointed to<br />\nput it into effect.<br />\nOnly three members of that committee are living, and those three are<br />\nresidents of Baltimore and well known<br />\nin its history: W.

In the new association the<br />\nPh.D. graduates, though less numerous, were more influential and more<br />\nactive, in spite of the fact that most<br />\nof them were also graduates of other<br />\ncolleges, which might have been assumed to have first claim on their<br />\nloyalty.<br />\nAs years passed the association<br />\ncontinued its activities, with some decline, I suspect, in the dignity and<br />\nsobriety of its annual dinners.

As one contribution to the solution of these problems the association offered a wholly new venture\u2014<br />\nthe establishment of an alumni magazine. It was clearly recognized that<br />\nthere might be less solidarity among<br />\nHopkins alumni than among the<br />\ngraduates of a university like Harvard or Yale, in which the college<br />\ntradition was ancient and dominantly established. It was hoped that the<br />\nnew periodical would tend \"to keep<br />\nalive the Hopkins spirit among all<br />\nclasses of our alumni.\" To give this<br />\nspirit meaning and value an Alumni<br />\nCouncil had shortly before been created with the thought that it would<br />\noccasionally meet with the Trustees,<br />\nand the hope was expressed that it<br />\nwould exercise a strong influence<br />\nupon the destinities of the University.<br />\nThe magazine is still in existence and<br />\nhas fulfilled the expectations of its<br />\nfounders, though the same can hardly<br />\nbe said of the Alumni Council.<br />\nActive Alumni Desirable<br />\nThe editors of the NEWS-LETTER<br />\nhave asked me to give my reasons for<br />\nthinking a live alumni association at<br />\nHopkins desirable. The historical<br />\nsketch which I have just given is my<br />\nfirst reason. An organization that<br />\nonce commanded the respect and support of men like Royce and Wilson<br />\nmust have had something to commend<br />\nit. An organization that has persisted for half a century, even though<br />\nmoribund for the past decade, can<br />\nhardly be unworthy of our serious<br />\nattention today. To me, at<br />\nit<br />\nseems a cause for real regret that the<br />\ntwentieth century has not built more<br />\nworthily upon the foundation laid by<br />\nthe nineteenth.<br />\n<br />\n\"To err is human; to forgive, dithe candidates carried on, at the<br />\nvery ballot box, a systematic cam- vine.

The Frosh A. B. defeated the Soph Electricals by a 28-13<br />\nscore and the T. A. 0. beat the Phi<br />\nAlphas, scoring 22 runs to the Alphas' 9. Other victories were posted<br />\nby 0.

The Dorms took second honors last season, while Soph Mechanicals copped the third position. Other<br />\n<br />\ncombines showing enough ability to<br />\nbe contenders for the title are the<br />\nFrosh A. B., Engineers A, Swats, and<br />\nNew Jersey All-Stars.

He has been pleased by the<br />\nmanner in which some of the teams<br />\nhave organized themselves into wellformed clubs.

Huxley House,<br />\nNew York, 1936. 227 pp.<br />\nDr. Robinson, renowned archaeologist and lecturer, has in the last<br />\ndecade proven himself one of the most<br />\nprolific authors in the Johns Hopkins<br />\nUniversity. Besides the\u2022 present histol'y of Greece, which is his seventeenth full-length volume; Dr. Robinson has to his credit well over three<br />\nhundred magazine articles. It is interesting to note that the book has<br />\nbeen dedicated to Isaiah Bowman,<br />\n\"Executive, Geographer, Instigator to<br />\nInvestigation, Humanist and Friend.\"<br />\nPerhaps one's first reaction in seeing the title of the book, A Short History of Greece, is that here is something superfluous, an unnecessary addition to an already large selection of<br />\nvolumes on the subject. Even a cursory perusal of Dr. Robinson's book,<br />\nhowever, will reveal the fact that it<br />\nis valuable for several reasons. First,<br />\nin its brevity it performs a service<br />\nto the lay reader and to the student<br />\nof elementary Greek history; and at<br />\nthe same time it avoids the other extreme of being too incomplete or too<br />\nsketchy. Second, Dr. Robinson has<br />\nstepped outside the customary pale<br />\nof history. Not only has he covered<br />\nthe orthodox ground of ancient history, but he has taken into account<br />\nmodern developments in archaeological and epigraphical research, and<br />\nhas made a specific effort to point out<br />\nthe debts owed by modern literature<br />\nand civilization to Greece.<br />\nIt is the latter point which forms<br />\nthe most interesting phase of the<br />\nvolume. Dr. Laurence Foster, of the<br />\nUniversity of Pennsylvania, in a brief<br />\nforeword, says that A Short History<br />\nof Greece \" . . . is the first book on<br />\nGreece to be written from the point<br />\nof view of civilization. Hence it is<br />\nunique. In addition to covering the<br />\ntraditional ground, the book takes<br />\ndue account of all contemporary research . . . The work is a coordinated<br />\nunit with sections on art, literature,<br />\nand philosophy as well as general<br />\nhistory. In order to lend true historical perspective, Professor Robinson<br />\nhas shown the influence of the Greeks<br />\non succeeding civilizations. All of the<br />\nvarious phases of Greek life are treated on such a high level of scholarship<br />\nthat the book is by far the most scholarly work in its field.\"<br />\nOf course, it was to be expected that<br />\nDr. Robinson would devote a fair portion of his history of Greece to the<br />\nstory of Olynthus, for the discovery<br />\nand excavation of which he will undoubtedly be long remembered. As a<br />\nmatter of fact, at least twenty pages<br />\nout of two hundred, are devoted to<br />\nthe results of one of the most astounding and significant excavational discoveries of modern times, which<br />\n\"has changed our ideas of the Greek<br />\nhouse, of mosaics, and has broken<br />\n<br />\nTi<br />\nWed<br />\nIf p]<br />\nbe s<br />\nrot<br />\nlater<br />\n<br />\ndown part of the barrier between Hellenic and Hellenistic civilization.\"<br />\n\u2014W. D.<br />\nMONOGRAM by G. B. Stern. Macmillan Company, New York.<br />\n1936. 293 pp. $2.50.<br />\n\"I did not want, and still do not<br />\nwant, to write a \"proper autobiography,\" said Miss Stern. And she did<br />\nnot!<br />\nHere is an autobiography that differs from others in its resolution to<br />\navoid conventionalities, to escape all<br />\nthe dulling, whimsical, over-intimate<br />\northodoxies of genuine biography.<br />\nWorking on the hypothesis that a life<br />\nstory is essentially the description of<br />\na mind rather than the narration of<br />\na personal history, Miss Stern decided, in writing the book, merely to use<br />\nherself as her subject and to write<br />\n\"with as much of myself as possible<br />\nto be left out.\"<br />\nThe result is a charming and witty picture of a human mind and a<br />\nhuman temperament. Monogram reduced itself to a comparatively disunited, rambling series of commentary, observation, associations, wit,<br />\npeople, places, and thoughts\u2014all the<br />\nresults of the association of ideas.<br />\nMiss Stern, in her very first paragraph, states her purpose when she<br />\npromises to avoid taking a straight<br />\nline and the shortest distance between<br />\ntwo points. Instead she chooses three<br />\nrandom points, connects them, and<br />\nexplores the enclosed area of the resultant triangle. Perhaps the idea is<br />\nbest expressed in a bit of dialogue<br />\ntaken by the authoress from a Marx<br />\nBrothers film:<br />\n\"It is my opinion that the missing<br />\npicture is hidden in the house next<br />\ndoor.\"<br />\n\"But there isn't a house next door.\"<br />\n\"Then we'll build one!\"<br />\nEven the interesting roaming of<br />\nMiss Stern's mind, however, does not<br />\nkeep her from describing a few details of her . family and family life.<br />\nBut these are, after all, the least important part of the volume. In Monogram, Miss Stern writes brilliantly<br />\non a great variety of subjects, on literature and life, on theatres and people, on an almost incredible selection<br />\nof subjects. It is notable that from<br />\nmodern life the authoress draws a<br />\nparticularly pessimistic moral: \"swift<br />\nlogic, decisive action, ruthless effici<br />\nency, hundred per cent organizationi<br />\nand the result nonsense.\"<br />\nMiss Stern relates a particularly<br />\nsavory \"legend called Hollywood\",<br />\nwhich is worth repetition. It seems<br />\nthat a \"voluptuous star went to see<br />\nthe 'Invisible Man' film, and was so<br />\ndelighted with the acting of the lead<br />\nthat she asked for an introduction.<br />\nSeveral months later (in a legend<br />\ncalled Hollywood) she was seen walking down Sunset Boulevard, wheeling<br />\na perambulator with absolutely nothing in it.\"\u2014W.

He wrote:<br /><br />\nFor the first ten years of its history, the Johns Hopkins University<br />\nhad no alumni organization of any<br />\nkind and doubtless felt no need of<br />\none, for the number of graduates was<br />\nsmall. However, in 1886 the tenth anniversary of the opening of the institution was regarded as an important<br />\nmilestone and was celebrated with<br />\nconsiderable seriousness. As part of<br />\nthis celebration a luncheon was held<br />\nin the gymnasium, attended by faculty, students, and alumni, and, of<br />\ncourse, enlivened by speeches. After<br />\nthe speaking Associate Professor<br />\nCraig, one of the most brilliant of<br />\nthat notable group of original Fellows, moved \"that an organization of<br />\ngraduates of the University be<br />\nformed.\" His motion was carried and<br />\na committee of ten was appointed to<br />\nput it into effect.<br />\nOnly three members of that committee are living, and those three are<br />\nresidents of Baltimore and well known<br />\nin its history: W. H. Howell, A.B. '81;<br />\nPh.D. '84; John Glenn, Jr., A.B. '85;<br />\nand Allan McLane, A.B,'86. The Committee presented its report on February 22, 1887, when a constitution was<br />\nadopted and Allan Marquard, Ph.D.<br />\n'80, then professor of art at Princeton,<br />\nwas elected as the first president.<br />\nAfter the usual Commemoration Day<br />\nexercises the Society assembled at the<br />\nSt. James Hotel for the first alumni<br />\ndinner. Josiah Royce, Ph.D. '78, one<br />\nof the four earliest graduates and<br />\nlong a distinguished professor of<br />\nphilosophy at Harvard, was the second president, and Woodrow Wilson<br />\nwas the third.<br />\n203 Alumni In First Ten Years<br />\nAt the end of the first ten years<br />\nthere had been 203 graduates, 119<br />\nwith the A.B. degree and 84 with the<br />\nPh.D. A study of the activities of all<br />\nformer students\u2014of course, a much<br />\nlarger number than the recipients of<br />\ndegrees\u2014showed that 178 had engaged in teaching, 80 had studied<br />\nmedicine, 38 were preachers, and 34<br />\nlawyers. In the new association the<br />\nPh.D. graduates, though less numerous, were more influential and more<br />\nactive, in spite of the fact that most<br />\nof them were also graduates of other<br />\ncolleges, which might have been assumed to have first claim on their<br />\nloyalty.<br />\nAs years passed the association<br />\ncontinued its activities, with some decline, I suspect, in the dignity and<br />\nsobriety of its annual dinners. Twenty-five years after its first meeting,<br />\nthe University was faced by many<br />\nnew problems. The long-awaited removal to Homewood was imminent;<br />\nthe creation of a school of engineering was under consideration; and the<br />\nstatus of the College in the new surroundings was a matter of serious debate. As one contribution to the solution of these problems the association offered a wholly new venture\u2014<br />\nthe establishment of an alumni magazine. It was clearly recognized that<br />\nthere might be less solidarity among<br />\nHopkins alumni than among the<br />\ngraduates of a university like Harvard or Yale, in which the college<br />\ntradition was ancient and dominantly established. It was hoped that the<br />\nnew periodical would tend \"to keep<br />\nalive the Hopkins spirit among all<br />\nclasses of our alumni.\" To give this<br />\nspirit meaning and value an Alumni<br />\nCouncil had shortly before been created with the thought that it would<br />\noccasionally meet with the Trustees,<br />\nand the hope was expressed that it<br />\nwould exercise a strong influence<br />\nupon the destinities of the University.<br />\nThe magazine is still in existence and<br />\nhas fulfilled the expectations of its<br />\nfounders, though the same can hardly<br />\nbe said of the Alumni Council.<br />\nActive Alumni Desirable<br />\nThe editors of the NEWS-LETTER<br />\nhave asked me to give my reasons for<br />\nthinking a live alumni association at<br />\nHopkins desirable. The historical<br />\nsketch which I have just given is my<br />\nfirst reason. An organization that<br />\nonce commanded the respect and support of men like Royce and Wilson<br />\nmust have had something to commend<br />\nit. An organization that has persisted for half a century, even though<br />\nmoribund for the past decade, can<br />\nhardly be unworthy of our serious<br />\nattention today. To me, at<br />\nit<br />\nseems a cause for real regret that the<br />\ntwentieth century has not built more<br />\nworthily upon the foundation laid by<br />\nthe nineteenth.<br /><br />\n\"To err is human; to forgive, dithe candidates carried on, at the<br />\nvery ballot box, a systematic cam- vine.

Robinson, Ph.D., LL.D.,<br />\nL.H.D., Litt.D. Huxley House,<br />\nNew York, 1936. 227 pp.<br />\nDr. Robinson, renowned archaeologist and lecturer, has in the last<br />\ndecade proven himself one of the most<br />\nprolific authors in the Johns Hopkins<br />\nUniversity. Besides the\u2022 present histol'y of Greece, which is his seventeenth full-length volume; Dr. Robinson has to his credit well over three<br />\nhundred magazine articles. It is interesting to note that the book has<br />\nbeen dedicated to Isaiah Bowman,<br />\n\"Executive, Geographer, Instigator to<br />\nInvestigation, Humanist and Friend.\"<br />\nPerhaps one's first reaction in seeing the title of the book, A Short History of Greece, is that here is something superfluous, an unnecessary addition to an already large selection of<br />\nvolumes on the subject. Even a cursory perusal of Dr. Robinson's book,<br />\nhowever, will reveal the fact that it<br />\nis valuable for several reasons. First,<br />\nin its brevity it performs a service<br />\nto the lay reader and to the student<br />\nof elementary Greek history; and at<br />\nthe same time it avoids the other extreme of being too incomplete or too<br />\nsketchy. Second, Dr. Robinson has<br />\nstepped outside the customary pale<br />\nof history. Not only has he covered<br />\nthe orthodox ground of ancient history, but he has taken into account<br />\nmodern developments in archaeological and epigraphical research, and<br />\nhas made a specific effort to point out<br />\nthe debts owed by modern literature<br />\nand civilization to Greece.<br />\nIt is the latter point which forms<br />\nthe most interesting phase of the<br />\nvolume. Dr. Laurence Foster, of the<br />\nUniversity of Pennsylvania, in a brief<br />\nforeword, says that A Short History<br />\nof Greece \" . . . is the first book on<br />\nGreece to be written from the point<br />\nof view of civilization. Hence it is<br />\nunique. In addition to covering the<br />\ntraditional ground, the book takes<br />\ndue account of all contemporary research . . . The work is a coordinated<br />\nunit with sections on art, literature,<br />\nand philosophy as well as general<br />\nhistory. In order to lend true historical perspective, Professor Robinson<br />\nhas shown the influence of the Greeks<br />\non succeeding civilizations. All of the<br />\nvarious phases of Greek life are treated on such a high level of scholarship<br />\nthat the book is by far the most scholarly work in its field.\"<br />\nOf course, it was to be expected that<br />\nDr. Robinson would devote a fair portion of his history of Greece to the<br />\nstory of Olynthus, for the discovery<br />\nand excavation of which he will undoubtedly be long remembered. As a<br />\nmatter of fact, at least twenty pages<br />\nout of two hundred, are devoted to<br />\nthe results of one of the most astounding and significant excavational discoveries of modern times, which<br />\n\"has changed our ideas of the Greek<br />\nhouse, of mosaics, and has broken<br /><br />\nTi<br />\nWed<br />\nIf p]<br />\nbe s<br />\nrot<br />\nlater<br /><br />\ndown part of the barrier between Hellenic and Hellenistic civilization.\"<br />\n\u2014W. D.<br />\nMONOGRAM by G. B. Stern. Macmillan Company, New York.<br />\n1936. 293 pp. $2.50.<br />\n\"I did not want, and still do not<br />\nwant, to write a \"proper autobiography,\" said Miss Stern. And she did<br />\nnot!<br />\nHere is an autobiography that differs from others in its resolution to<br />\navoid conventionalities, to escape all<br />\nthe dulling, whimsical, over-intimate<br />\northodoxies of genuine biography.<br />\nWorking on the hypothesis that a life<br />\nstory is essentially the description of<br />\na mind rather than the narration of<br />\na personal history, Miss Stern decided, in writing the book, merely to use<br />\nherself as her subject and to write<br />\n\"with as much of myself as possible<br />\nto be left out.\"<br />\nThe result is a charming and witty picture of a human mind and a<br />\nhuman temperament. Monogram reduced itself to a comparatively disunited, rambling series of commentary, observation, associations, wit,<br />\npeople, places, and thoughts\u2014all the<br />\nresults of the association of ideas.<br />\nMiss Stern, in her very first paragraph, states her purpose when she<br />\npromises to avoid taking a straight<br />\nline and the shortest distance between<br />\ntwo points. Instead she chooses three<br />\nrandom points, connects them, and<br />\nexplores the enclosed area of the resultant triangle. Perhaps the idea is<br />\nbest expressed in a bit of dialogue<br />\ntaken by the authoress from a Marx<br />\nBrothers film:<br />\n\"It is my opinion that the missing<br />\npicture is hidden in the house next<br />\ndoor.\"<br />\n\"But there isn't a house next door.\"<br />\n\"Then we'll build one!\"<br />\nEven the interesting roaming of<br />\nMiss Stern's mind, however, does not<br />\nkeep her from describing a few details of her . family and family life.<br />\nBut these are, after all, the least important part of the volume. In Monogram, Miss Stern writes brilliantly<br />\non a great variety of subjects, on literature and life, on theatres and people, on an almost incredible selection<br />\nof subjects. It is notable that from<br />\nmodern life the authoress draws a<br />\nparticularly pessimistic moral: \"swift<br />\nlogic, decisive action, ruthless effici<br />\nency, hundred per cent organizationi<br />\nand the result nonsense.\"<br />\nMiss Stern relates a particularly<br />\nsavory \"legend called Hollywood\",<br />\nwhich is worth repetition. It seems<br />\nthat a \"voluptuous star went to see<br />\nthe 'Invisible Man' film, and was so<br />\ndelighted with the acting of the lead<br />\nthat she asked for an introduction.<br />\nSeveral months later (in a legend<br />\ncalled Hollywood) she was seen walking down Sunset Boulevard, wheeling<br />\na perambulator with absolutely nothing in it.\"\u2014W.
