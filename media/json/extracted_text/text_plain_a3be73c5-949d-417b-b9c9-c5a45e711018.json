The<br />\nband of 100 Hopkins men who<br />\nyelled their encouragement and approval to their fellows on the gridiron Saturday were fully rewarded for their spirit. Captain Guild,<br />\nof the faculty, and Captain Elliott,<br />\nhis predecessor as professor of<br />\nmilitary science and tactics, rooted their hardest for the Black and<br />\nBlue, as did many more of the officers and soldiers from the Regular Army regiments stationed at<br />\nGettysburg.

What have we,<br />\nas undergraduates of Hopkins, to<br />\noffer our country when it calls us?<br />\nAbove all other things we want to<br />\nbe able to give an acute mind and<br />\na sound body.<br />\nProbably there has been no better opportunity in the history of<br />\nthe University to show at once<br />\nloyalty to our Alma Mater and patriotism to our country than that<br />\nafforded by the Reserve Officers'<br />\nTraining Corps. I appeal especially to the upper classmen who<br />\nare looking lightly upon military<br />\ntraining. The degree of seriousnegs with which the question<br />\nShould be considered cannot be<br />\nover-estimated. That you are<br />\nbenefiting yourself by joining the<br />\ncorps is trivial; that you are aiding your country in earnestness<br />\nof spirit is the all-important feature. Join the battalion\u2014it is a<br />\nGovernment institution. Where<br />\nare the \"loyal sons of Hopkins?\"<br />\nLet's have some real, old-time Hopkins spirit! A little pep!<br />\n<br />\nfreshmen\u2014look on the regulations<br />\nas no more than a mild form of<br />\nhazing to make new students uncomfortable. This childish idea,<br />\nof course, has no place in the real<br />\npurpose of putting these restrictions upon the behavior of freshmen. The actual motive behind it<br />\nall, as I see it, is making the<br />\nnew men loyal, \u2022 working, living<br />\nparts of the one great organism\u2014<br />\nthe Johns Hopkins University.<br />\nFirst of all, the first-year student<br />\nmust be made to realize that when<br />\nhe.enters the University he is being made heir to all that has been<br />\nleft by those who have gone before\u2014to its splendid enducational<br />\nadvantages, to its glorious traditions, to its opportunities for selfbetterment. He must be impressed<br />\nby the earnestness, the dignity of<br />\nthe institution; he must feel the<br />\nsignificance of linking his name<br />\nwith that of a university whose<br />\nreputation for the zealous pursuit<br />\nof learning is little less than<br />\nworld-wide. He should thrill with<br />\nthe sense of loyalty to that institution; with a feeling of deep obligation that cannot be repaid; with<br />\na consciousness of the duty to uphold its good name at any cost.<br />\nAnd at the same time, he sould be<br />\naware of his individual littleness<br />\nin the great complexity of the University; he should realize his extreme relative unimportance. After all, the secret of it all is in humility\u2014not in humiliation. And if<br />\nthe first-year men will regard them<br />\nin this light, the freshman regulations will go far in accomplishing<br />\ntheir aim.<br />\n<br />\nSOPHOMORE.<br />\nOctober 12, 1917.<br />\nLauds Paddling Party.<br />\nTo the Editor of THE NEWS-LETTER:<br />\n<br />\nSir\u2014Score one for the sophomores!

Plans for the coming year<br />\nare being formulated by Monroe<br />\nFiror, secretary of the Council,<br />\nand it is probable that the immediate work of the Hopkins men will<br />\nbe to supervise interscholastic<br />\nbasket-ball.<br />\nA committee, on which Firor<br />\nand President Wolfe, of the Athletic Association are serving, is<br />\nnow engaged in drawing up a constitution. The athletic associations of the city \"prep\" schools<br />\nhave been asked to send in their<br />\nopinion as to what the character<br />\nand limitations of the league<br />\nshould be and express the immediate desires of their schools in regard to interscholastic athletics.<br />\nThese statements are to be influential in determining the scope of<br />\nthe constitution.<br />\nThe Council, which is composed<br />\nof former members of Baltimore<br />\npreparatory schools, has as its<br />\npurpose the stimulation and supervision of sports among \"prep\"<br />\nschools. Last spring it offered a<br />\ntrophy to the champion baseball<br />\nteam of the city, but made no<br />\naward because of a dispute which<br />\narose as to which institution was<br />\nthe rightful winner.

BALTIMORE STREET<br />\n<br />\nGETTYSBURG GAME ENDS IN TIE<br />\n<br />\nUNDERGRADUATES NUMBER 404<br />\n<br />\n(Continuedfrom page I)<br />\n<br />\nEnrollment Lists Show 47 Seniors, 60<br />\nJuniors, 130 Sophomores and 161<br />\nFreshmen \u2014Four Special<br />\n<br />\ntercepted a forward pass on the<br />\nfourth down and recovered the<br />\nball. Honors were even for the<br />\nrest of the half. Purcell ran a<br />\npunt back 40 yards at the beginning of the second period, shortly<br />\nafter which Rote intercepted a<br />\nforward pass and raced away for<br />\n35 yards before he was stopped.<br />\nJones broke up a beautiful pass<br />\nfrom Rote to Moyer and prevented<br />\na possible touchdown just as the<br />\nhalf ended.<br />\nBoth .teams scored touchdowns<br />\nin the third period. Winslow<br />\nkicked off against the wind and<br />\nHamill returned the ball 20 yards,<br />\nMoyer got 5 more through the line<br />\nand Rote carried it to the Hopkins 16-yard line on the next play.<br />\nA 15-yard penalty put the ball on<br />\nHopkins' 1-yard line, from where<br />\nRote immediately carried it over<br />\nfor the first touchdown of the<br />\ngame. Rote's try for goal went<br />\nwide.<br />\nHopkins came right back. Purcell ran back the kick-off 20 yards.<br />\nJones fought his way for 20 more.<br />\nJones made all but first down on<br />\nthe next play and Purcell took it<br />\nover. Jones, Carey and Purcell<br />\nmade three more first downs, the<br />\nball was on Gettysburg's 19-yard<br />\nline, but the Blue and Gold team<br />\nclosed up the holes on the next<br />\ntwo plays. Then Carey threw a<br />\npass heading right between the<br />\ngoal posts. Just as a Gettysburg<br />\nman, in the very shadow of the<br />\ngoal posts, thought he had the<br />\nball, it glanced his shoulder and<br />\nbounced away, only to fall in the<br />\nwide-stretched arms of Alec Wolfe,<br />\nwho was behind the goal line and<br />\napparently wide-awake to just<br />\nsuch an opportunity. Schmidt<br />\ntried hard to win the game with<br />\na goal from touchdown but missed.<br />\nThe third period opened with<br />\nboth teams fighting desperately.<br />\nThe Hopkins battle-cry, \"Speed<br />\nthe plow,\" resounded down the<br />\nfield as Hopkins took the ball in<br />\nmid-field. On the second play,<br />\nJones got away from 30 yards.<br />\nJones and Purcell, alternately<br />\ncarrying the ball, made a first<br />\ndown and then another. Again<br />\nHopkins had the ball on Gettysburg's 20-yard line; three line<br />\nplunges failed to gain anything<br />\nand Schmidt dropped back for a<br />\ndrop-kick, which went wide only<br />\nby a few inches. Hopkins had the<br />\nball during most of the remaining<br />\nthree minutes of the game.<br />\nThe line-up was as follows:<br />\nGettysburg.<br />\nPos.<br />\nScheffer<br />\nL E<br />\nThompson<br />\nL.

In view of<br />\nthe numerous enlistments during<br />\nlast spring and summer, these figures will be of special interest to<br />\nthe members of the upper classes<br />\nwho are anxious to know just<br />\nwhere they stand.<br />\nThere are 47 men enrolled in<br />\nthe Senior Class; this number inincludes the engineering men who<br />\nentered with the present Junior<br />\nClass and who are completing the<br />\ncourse in three years. The Senior<br />\nClass has also been augmented by<br />\na number of men who entered<br />\ncollege this year or last year<br />\nwith credit from outside colleges.<br />\nThe Senior Class, therefore,'will<br />\nbe much larger than was generally<br />\nexpected. On the other hand, the<br />\nJunior Class numbers only 60,<br />\nwhich is much below the general<br />\nestimate of its class officers. One<br />\nhundred and thirty men, out of<br />\nthe 157 who finished their first<br />\nyear, returned as members of the<br />\nSophomore Class. The Freshman<br />\nClass has 161 members enrolled\u2014<br />\napproximately the same number<br />\nof men who entered the University<br />\nlast year.

It was a thrilling game; full<br />\nof good tackling, long end runs,<br />\ndashing line plunges and sensaAlthough out.tional passes.<br />\nweighed at least ten pounds to the<br />\nman, the Hopkins crew was more<br />\nthan a match for their big opponents and even outplayed them in<br />\nthe latter stages of the game.<br />\nFor the first time in many a day,<br />\na Hopkins team went to fight in<br />\nforeign territory accompanied by<br />\na real, live crowd of rooters. The<br />\nband of 100 Hopkins men who<br />\nyelled their encouragement and approval to their fellows on the gridiron Saturday were fully rewarded for their spirit. Captain Guild,<br />\nof the faculty, and Captain Elliott,<br />\nhis predecessor as professor of<br />\nmilitary science and tactics, rooted their hardest for the Black and<br />\nBlue, as did many more of the officers and soldiers from the Regular Army regiments stationed at<br />\nGettysburg. The team appreci.ated their whole-hearted support<br />\nand responded by fighting every<br />\nminute of the four periods by holding the Gettysburgers well in<br />\ncheck.<br />\nAlec Wolfe became the hero of<br />\nthe game when he caught a 25yard forward pass from Carey off<br />\na Gettysburg man's chest and<br />\nplanted the ball under the goal<br />\nposts for Hopkins' only score.<br />\nBut he was not the only star.<br />\nPurcell ran back Rote's punts in<br />\nmagnificent style and played for<br />\nthree periods with a bad leg;<br />\nJones plowed through the strong<br />\nGettysburg line time and again<br />\nfor substantial gains; Cashell<br />\nplayed a great defensive game;<br />\nCarey threw the pass that tied the<br />\nscore; and the line was both a<br />\nstone wall on the defense and a<br />\nsteel wedge on the offense. Winslow outpunted Rote and killed<br />\nmany and embryo end run. Capt.<br />\nDick Woodward was in the game<br />\nWith all the old fight and pep.<br />\nGettysburg started off with a<br />\nrush, but Hopkins soon found itself and settled down. Rote, soon<br />\nafter the kick-off, broke loose for<br />\na 65-yard run to the Hopkins 15yard line, where Winslow managed to spill him through a pretty<br />\nPiece of headwork. Winslow<br />\nSlowed him up by balking him, and<br />\nthen made a sure, hard tackle. The<br />\nHopkins line stiffened, threw the<br />\nGettysburgers back for losses, in-<br /><br />\nBecause of the arising of unforeseen difficulties, the organization meeting of the track team of<br />\n1917-18 was not held last Wednesday as was planned, but was<br />\npostponed until this Thursday at<br />\n12.30 o'clock. All the old men<br />\nand all candidates are to meet at<br />\nthat hour in the lecture hall of the<br />\nCivil Engineering Building, where<br />\nCoach Joseph T. England, Capt.<br />\nMonroe Firor and Manager Carroll will outline the program of<br />\nthe year and tell the men of the<br />\ntraditions to be upheld.<br />\nSince Captain Firor is attending the Medical School and cannot<br />\nbe on hand about Homewood, except at practices, Beverly Smith,<br />\ncaptain of last year's freshman<br />\nteam and a member of the 'Varsity relay, will assist him in taking charge of the undergraduate<br />\ncandidates. Guy Leadbetter, a<br />\nsecond-year medical student and<br />\ngraduate of Bowdoin, will help<br />\nthe coach again this year by instructing candidates in field work<br />\nand will add materially to the<br />\nsuccess of the squad by his ability<br />\nin the weight events.<br />\nA number of former stars of<br />\nother universities, who are now in<br />\nthe Medical School, have been discovered by Firor, and have signified their intention of becoming<br />\nmembers of the squad. Also a<br />\nnumber of sprinters graduated<br />\nfrom Baltimore\"prep\"schoolsore<br />\nworking_ out on the cross-country<br />\ncourse with last year's men.<br />\nThe course is in better shape<br />\nthan it has been for years, and is<br />\nmarked all the way by posts painted white. It is approximately two<br />\nmiles in length. The management<br />\nof the team, however, in order to<br />\nmake sure of the distance covered,<br />\nis arranging to have it surveyed,<br />\nand this job may be taken over by<br />\nsome of the engineering students.<br />\nIf the plans now under consideration are adopted a number of large<br />\ncross country meets will be held<br />\non it.<br />\nCoach England is desirous of<br />\na large attendance at the organization meeting, as the schedule<br />\nnow being arranged will require<br />\na big squad to carry it through.<br />\nSince this year offers exceptional<br />\nopportunities for freshmen, it is<br />\nhoped that they will turn out in<br />\nlarge numbers.<br />\nAll candidates for the track team<br />\nhave been excused from drill on<br />\nThursdays by Captain Guild.<br />\nThey must attend the other drills<br />\nand lectures, however.<br /><br />\nThe Johns Hopkins Reserve Officers' Training Corps is to have a<br />\nfull calibre rifle range or its equivalent by the spring of 1918. According to Captain Guild, plans<br />\nthe present time are necessarily uncertain, but unless something unforeseen happens Hopkins<br />\nis sure to have at least a low calibre range in which the work of a<br />\nfull calibre range will be closely<br />\nsimulated, and which will be of<br />\nalmost equal value to the student<br />\nofficers.<br />\nIt is now ungrtain whether the<br />\nJohns HopkinW corps will be, allowed to retain the Krag rifles obtained last year from the War Department. It is the' opinion of<br />\nCaptain Guild that such an event<br />\n4 not unlikely in view of the great<br />\nneed for rifles at the present time.<br />\nShould the rifles have to be turned<br />\nin, the use of a full range would<br />\nof course be out of the question,<br />\nand the lower calibre range would<br />\nhave to be substituted.<br />\nA suitable distinguishing device<br />\nfor the Johns Hopkins Corps,<br />\nprobably an adaptation of the<br />\nJohns Hopkins seal, is to be worn<br />\non the campaign hats and swagger<br />\nsticks are to be carried by the officers as an insignia of rank.<br />\nThe officers of the corps express<br />\npraticular satisfaction with regard to the work of the\u2022 recruit<br />\ncompany. The progress has been<br />\nsuch as to warrant the prediction<br />\nthat the recruit company as a distinct unit will soon be a thing of<br />\nthe past.<br />\nGeneral orders issued last Friday set the program for drills and<br />\noutline the conduct of both individuals and battalion for the coming year. On drill days the first<br />\ncall is to be at 4.05 P. M., the assembly at 4.10 and the recall at 6.<br />\nMonday and Thursday are set as<br />\ndrill days for the entire battalion,<br />\nand Tuesday for optional drills<br />\nfor the companies in rotation.<br />\nDuring inclement weather assembly will take place in the driveway<br />\ntunnel of Gilman Hall.<br />\nParticular stress 'is laid upon<br />\nthe necessity of the elimination<br />\nof lateness and tardiness in the<br />\ncompanies. Opportunities to make<br />\nup drills will be given but the<br />\n'be espepenalties this year will<br />\ncially heavy, ana every effort will<br />\nbe made to stamp out the evil.<br />\nCaptain Guild strongly recommends the wearing of the uniform<br />\nat all times by the men.<br /><br />\nThe membership of the faculty<br />\nand students of the engineering<br />\ndepartment has been greatly reduced by enlistments in war service.<br />\nOne fourth of last year's faculty<br />\nof the department of civil engineering is now engaged in war<br />\nwork.

What have we,<br />\nas undergraduates of Hopkins, to<br />\noffer our country when it calls us?<br />\nAbove all other things we want to<br />\nbe able to give an acute mind and<br />\na sound body.<br />\nProbably there has been no better opportunity in the history of<br />\nthe University to show at once<br />\nloyalty to our Alma Mater and patriotism to our country than that<br />\nafforded by the Reserve Officers'<br />\nTraining Corps. I appeal especially to the upper classmen who<br />\nare looking lightly upon military<br />\ntraining. The degree of seriousnegs with which the question<br />\nShould be considered cannot be<br />\nover-estimated. That you are<br />\nbenefiting yourself by joining the<br />\ncorps is trivial; that you are aiding your country in earnestness<br />\nof spirit is the all-important feature. Join the battalion\u2014it is a<br />\nGovernment institution. Where<br />\nare the \"loyal sons of Hopkins?\"<br />\nLet's have some real, old-time Hopkins spirit! A little pep!<br /><br />\nfreshmen\u2014look on the regulations<br />\nas no more than a mild form of<br />\nhazing to make new students uncomfortable. This childish idea,<br />\nof course, has no place in the real<br />\npurpose of putting these restrictions upon the behavior of freshmen. The actual motive behind it<br />\nall, as I see it, is making the<br />\nnew men loyal, \u2022 working, living<br />\nparts of the one great organism\u2014<br />\nthe Johns Hopkins University.<br />\nFirst of all, the first-year student<br />\nmust be made to realize that when<br />\nhe.enters the University he is being made heir to all that has been<br />\nleft by those who have gone before\u2014to its splendid enducational<br />\nadvantages, to its glorious traditions, to its opportunities for selfbetterment. He must be impressed<br />\nby the earnestness, the dignity of<br />\nthe institution; he must feel the<br />\nsignificance of linking his name<br />\nwith that of a university whose<br />\nreputation for the zealous pursuit<br />\nof learning is little less than<br />\nworld-wide. He should thrill with<br />\nthe sense of loyalty to that institution; with a feeling of deep obligation that cannot be repaid; with<br />\na consciousness of the duty to uphold its good name at any cost.<br />\nAnd at the same time, he sould be<br />\naware of his individual littleness<br />\nin the great complexity of the University; he should realize his extreme relative unimportance. After all, the secret of it all is in humility\u2014not in humiliation. And if<br />\nthe first-year men will regard them<br />\nin this light, the freshman regulations will go far in accomplishing<br />\ntheir aim.<br /><br />\nSOPHOMORE.<br />\nOctober 12, 1917.<br />\nLauds Paddling Party.<br />\nTo the Editor of THE NEWS-LETTER:<br /><br />\nSir\u2014Score one for the sophomores!

Plans for the coming year<br />\nare being formulated by Monroe<br />\nFiror, secretary of the Council,<br />\nand it is probable that the immediate work of the Hopkins men will<br />\nbe to supervise interscholastic<br />\nbasket-ball.<br />\nA committee, on which Firor<br />\nand President Wolfe, of the Athletic Association are serving, is<br />\nnow engaged in drawing up a constitution. The athletic associations of the city \"prep\" schools<br />\nhave been asked to send in their<br />\nopinion as to what the character<br />\nand limitations of the league<br />\nshould be and express the immediate desires of their schools in regard to interscholastic athletics.<br />\nThese statements are to be influential in determining the scope of<br />\nthe constitution.<br />\nThe Council, which is composed<br />\nof former members of Baltimore<br />\npreparatory schools, has as its<br />\npurpose the stimulation and supervision of sports among \"prep\"<br />\nschools. Last spring it offered a<br />\ntrophy to the champion baseball<br />\nteam of the city, but made no<br />\naward because of a dispute which<br />\narose as to which institution was<br />\nthe rightful winner. During this<br />\nyear, however if its plans become<br />\neffective, the'<br />\nCouncil will play a<br />\nlarge part in furthering friendly<br />\nathletic relations among the city<br />\nschools.<br />\nENGI VEERING SCHOOL DEPLETED<br /><br />\n(Continued from page I)<br /><br />\n7<br /><br />\n\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022<br /><br />\nSuits and Overcoats<br />\nto please the eye and purse<br />\nof the man at college, $15<br />\nto $50.

Honors were even for the<br />\nrest of the half. Purcell ran a<br />\npunt back 40 yards at the beginning of the second period, shortly<br />\nafter which Rote intercepted a<br />\nforward pass and raced away for<br />\n35 yards before he was stopped.<br />\nJones broke up a beautiful pass<br />\nfrom Rote to Moyer and prevented<br />\na possible touchdown just as the<br />\nhalf ended.<br />\nBoth .teams scored touchdowns<br />\nin the third period. Winslow<br />\nkicked off against the wind and<br />\nHamill returned the ball 20 yards,<br />\nMoyer got 5 more through the line<br />\nand Rote carried it to the Hopkins 16-yard line on the next play.<br />\nA 15-yard penalty put the ball on<br />\nHopkins' 1-yard line, from where<br />\nRote immediately carried it over<br />\nfor the first touchdown of the<br />\ngame. Rote's try for goal went<br />\nwide.<br />\nHopkins came right back. Purcell ran back the kick-off 20 yards.<br />\nJones fought his way for 20 more.<br />\nJones made all but first down on<br />\nthe next play and Purcell took it<br />\nover. Jones, Carey and Purcell<br />\nmade three more first downs, the<br />\nball was on Gettysburg's 19-yard<br />\nline, but the Blue and Gold team<br />\nclosed up the holes on the next<br />\ntwo plays. Then Carey threw a<br />\npass heading right between the<br />\ngoal posts. Just as a Gettysburg<br />\nman, in the very shadow of the<br />\ngoal posts, thought he had the<br />\nball, it glanced his shoulder and<br />\nbounced away, only to fall in the<br />\nwide-stretched arms of Alec Wolfe,<br />\nwho was behind the goal line and<br />\napparently wide-awake to just<br />\nsuch an opportunity. Schmidt<br />\ntried hard to win the game with<br />\na goal from touchdown but missed.<br />\nThe third period opened with<br />\nboth teams fighting desperately.<br />\nThe Hopkins battle-cry, \"Speed<br />\nthe plow,\" resounded down the<br />\nfield as Hopkins took the ball in<br />\nmid-field. On the second play,<br />\nJones got away from 30 yards.<br />\nJones and Purcell, alternately<br />\ncarrying the ball, made a first<br />\ndown and then another. Again<br />\nHopkins had the ball on Gettysburg's 20-yard line; three line<br />\nplunges failed to gain anything<br />\nand Schmidt dropped back for a<br />\ndrop-kick, which went wide only<br />\nby a few inches. Hopkins had the<br />\nball during most of the remaining<br />\nthree minutes of the game.<br />\nThe line-up was as follows:<br />\nGettysburg.<br />\nPos.<br />\nScheffer<br />\nL E<br />\nThompson<br />\nL.
