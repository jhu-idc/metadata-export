Cleveland<br />\n<br />\nHopkins Is Lagging<br />\nFounded eighty-six years ago as the first true \"university\" in America, The Johns Hopkins University promoted what was then a highly revolutionary concept in<br />\neducation. We note with disappointment, however, that<br />\nthe University subsequently, far from being revolutionary, has had difficulty even keeping abreast of<br />\nchanges in modern educational methods and concepts.<br />\nOther universities and colleges, originally taking<br />\ntheir cue from the Hopkins, have forged far ahead of<br />\nus. The has been little in the way of experimentation<br />\noi pioneering in teaching methods or programs here<br />\nfor many years. We should like to make a suggestion or<br />\ntwo\u2014ideas that have been tried on other campuses and<br />\ncould very well succeed here at Hopkins if initiated on<br />\na not too ambitious scale.<br />\nMany universities have a well-integrated \"honors\"<br />\nprogram for qualified students. Special tutorial systems<br />\nprovide a unified, interrelating course of study. The<br />\nmajority of Hopkins students are without advice or<br />\nill-advised as to course selection. A schedule is drawn<br />\nup with little in mind except the minimum requirements for graduate school. There should be greater interdependence between courses and more continuity<br />\nfrom year to year. Students shouldn't be left loose to<br />\nmake haphazard course selections. This is the point<br />\nwhere \"freedom\" shades off into neglect.<br />\nAnother highly valuable enterprise would he the<br />\ndevelopment of an organized \"junior year abroad\" program. Many far poorer colleges than Hopkins have very<br />\neffective and integrated study-abroad systems. A Hopkins student venturing abroad goes blindly down a haphazard road with little idea of what he intends to accomplish in Europe. An experience of this type is of<br />\ndoubtful educational value.<br />\nThe introduction of at least make-shift language<br />\nlaboratories, before the construction of the new library, would be feasible. Such facilities have become<br />\ncommonplace on all but the poorest of campuses.<br />\nThe deficiencies are both numerous and obvious.<br />\nThe above suggestions are hut a few of many badly<br />\nneeded innovations. They can be done slowly and without great initial expense. It takes only a few people with<br />\nthe experience and capabilities to carry them out.<br />\nThe administration of the University certainly realizes where the deficiencies lie. But action is long overdue.<br />\n<br />\nLeadership?<br />\nThe concept of leadership on this campus has become somewhat distorted. The actions of many of our<br />\nso-called \"student leaders\" are taking a disturbingly<br />\nnegative and pointless turn.<br />\nThe current wrangle over the establishment of a<br />\n\"Gentleman's Code Commrssion\" is nothing new to the<br />\nHomewood campus. For years our student governments<br />\nhave exaggerated issues of this nature, intentionally or<br />\nunwittingly, as an excuse for avoiding their more fundamental responsibilities to the university and the student<br />\nbody. As the almost undivided attention of our \"student<br />\nleaders\" goes into this problem, many vital services to<br />\nand needs of the students go utterly neglected. With the<br />\nuse of a little imagination much could be done to better<br />\nthe lot of the undergraduate student body.<br />\nA case in point is the News-Letter's charter bus to<br />\nNew York City for the Christmas holidays. This is one<br />\ntype of operation the Student Council could easily promote for the general benefit of the stodents and university staff. But there was little interest. Even ODK,<br />\nsupposedly the epitome of campus leadership, just couldnot be bothered with the responsibility of sponsoring<br />\nsuch a charter. So the News-Letter, in despair of finding<br />\nany campus organizations not preoccupied with the Gentleman's Code Commission, has combined with Dr.<br />\nWickwire's energetic assistants, Keith Payne and Paul<br />\nKoons, to sponsor this financially profitless venture into<br />\nstudent service.<br />\nBut this is only one of countless projects that<br />\nmight be pursued if our \"student leaders\" were not so<br />\npreoccupied with \"leading\" and legislating. One of the<br />\nfew valuable functions the Student Council does perform, sponsorship of the Friday morning lectures, is<br />\nnow $200 in the red, as we are given to understand.<br />\nMoreover, the adverse affect on the prestige of our<br />\ntwo representative councils is obvious. An exaggerated<br />\ncampaign to devise new and more elegant methods of<br />\nconducting student trials is bound to draw bitter resentment from the students. This is especially true when<br />\nthe campaign is conducted to the exclusion of most<br />\nother vital student services.<br />\nThe regard held for our student leaders atad student government never has been very high here at<br />\nHopkins.

But for most, the dance<br />\nmarthon is pass\u00e9. America's<br />\nyouth has taken its stamina and<br />\nidiocy to greener and more preposterous pastures.<br />\nLast week, for instance, students at three Michigan universities were vieing for the telephone talkathon title. Western<br />\nMichigan University had its<br />\n<br />\nstudents talking between dormitories in half hour shifts.

Jt was a Romeo-Juliet.<br />\n'Here we are at last, after all!'<br />\nscene. As a matter of fact there<br />\nis one other point where Mr. Anderson departs from the Bard of<br />\nAvon, that is, in the character<br />\nof the judge. He was really not<br />\nwell enough drawn to be a Lear<br />\n\u2014after all Lear represents society rather than his own opinion of his role in society.<br />\nIf Mr. Anderson justified his<br />\ninterpretation of Shakespeare<br />\nphilosophically (and there is that<br />\npossibility) he most certainly<br />\ncould not stylistically.

Perhaps the Council feels<br />\nthat upon election all forms of<br />\nties with the electors cease, are<br />\nbroken, or are cut away by electoral pluralities.

The coach was George Young and the players, the<br />\nMaryland Scholastic all-stars preparing for Sunday's benefit game at Memorial Stadium for Freddie Sturm, who<br />\ntoday lien paralyzed in a state hospital on account of an<br />\nearly seNson grid catastrophe.<br />\nBengon had just entered the room after administering<br />\nto a would-be gymnast who attempted a double somersault<br />\nand had come up with a possible broken leg.

Characklis, a<br />\n6'4\" sophomore from Annapolis,<br />\nMaryland, led the scoring with<br />\n16 points while Krouner contributed 14.

Several members<br />\nof the Council argued that the<br />\nhouse<br />\npresidents had<br />\nbeen<br />\nelected to make these decisions<br />\nthemselves rather than to refer<br />\nthe issues to the dorm students.<br />\nOthers pointed out that since<br />\nthe DSRC had told the Student<br />\nCouncil it would present the issue at the week's house meetings, it should follow this course<br />\nof action.

The<br />\nnew crop of wash-and-wear jackets in combinations of Dacron and cotton are almost shirting<br />\nweight, and unlined in the bargain. Two positive<br />\ntrends are notable; giant plaids for the pace-setters; subtle colorings in the native craft fabrics<br />\n(batik, madras, Kalamkari) for the conservatives. Outstanding color-mates in the plaids will<br />\nbe either olive and blue or olive and grey. These<br />\nlook best with solid color lightweight trousers in<br />\ndeep olive or grey.

Cleveland<br /><br />\nHopkins Is Lagging<br />\nFounded eighty-six years ago as the first true \"university\" in America, The Johns Hopkins University promoted what was then a highly revolutionary concept in<br />\neducation. We note with disappointment, however, that<br />\nthe University subsequently, far from being revolutionary, has had difficulty even keeping abreast of<br />\nchanges in modern educational methods and concepts.<br />\nOther universities and colleges, originally taking<br />\ntheir cue from the Hopkins, have forged far ahead of<br />\nus. The has been little in the way of experimentation<br />\noi pioneering in teaching methods or programs here<br />\nfor many years. We should like to make a suggestion or<br />\ntwo\u2014ideas that have been tried on other campuses and<br />\ncould very well succeed here at Hopkins if initiated on<br />\na not too ambitious scale.<br />\nMany universities have a well-integrated \"honors\"<br />\nprogram for qualified students. Special tutorial systems<br />\nprovide a unified, interrelating course of study. The<br />\nmajority of Hopkins students are without advice or<br />\nill-advised as to course selection. A schedule is drawn<br />\nup with little in mind except the minimum requirements for graduate school. There should be greater interdependence between courses and more continuity<br />\nfrom year to year. Students shouldn't be left loose to<br />\nmake haphazard course selections. This is the point<br />\nwhere \"freedom\" shades off into neglect.<br />\nAnother highly valuable enterprise would he the<br />\ndevelopment of an organized \"junior year abroad\" program. Many far poorer colleges than Hopkins have very<br />\neffective and integrated study-abroad systems. A Hopkins student venturing abroad goes blindly down a haphazard road with little idea of what he intends to accomplish in Europe. An experience of this type is of<br />\ndoubtful educational value.<br />\nThe introduction of at least make-shift language<br />\nlaboratories, before the construction of the new library, would be feasible. Such facilities have become<br />\ncommonplace on all but the poorest of campuses.<br />\nThe deficiencies are both numerous and obvious.<br />\nThe above suggestions are hut a few of many badly<br />\nneeded innovations. They can be done slowly and without great initial expense. It takes only a few people with<br />\nthe experience and capabilities to carry them out.<br />\nThe administration of the University certainly realizes where the deficiencies lie. But action is long overdue.<br /><br />\nLeadership?<br />\nThe concept of leadership on this campus has become somewhat distorted. The actions of many of our<br />\nso-called \"student leaders\" are taking a disturbingly<br />\nnegative and pointless turn.<br />\nThe current wrangle over the establishment of a<br />\n\"Gentleman's Code Commrssion\" is nothing new to the<br />\nHomewood campus. For years our student governments<br />\nhave exaggerated issues of this nature, intentionally or<br />\nunwittingly, as an excuse for avoiding their more fundamental responsibilities to the university and the student<br />\nbody. As the almost undivided attention of our \"student<br />\nleaders\" goes into this problem, many vital services to<br />\nand needs of the students go utterly neglected. With the<br />\nuse of a little imagination much could be done to better<br />\nthe lot of the undergraduate student body.<br />\nA case in point is the News-Letter's charter bus to<br />\nNew York City for the Christmas holidays. This is one<br />\ntype of operation the Student Council could easily promote for the general benefit of the stodents and university staff. But there was little interest. Even ODK,<br />\nsupposedly the epitome of campus leadership, just couldnot be bothered with the responsibility of sponsoring<br />\nsuch a charter. So the News-Letter, in despair of finding<br />\nany campus organizations not preoccupied with the Gentleman's Code Commission, has combined with Dr.<br />\nWickwire's energetic assistants, Keith Payne and Paul<br />\nKoons, to sponsor this financially profitless venture into<br />\nstudent service.<br />\nBut this is only one of countless projects that<br />\nmight be pursued if our \"student leaders\" were not so<br />\npreoccupied with \"leading\" and legislating. One of the<br />\nfew valuable functions the Student Council does perform, sponsorship of the Friday morning lectures, is<br />\nnow $200 in the red, as we are given to understand.<br />\nMoreover, the adverse affect on the prestige of our<br />\ntwo representative councils is obvious. An exaggerated<br />\ncampaign to devise new and more elegant methods of<br />\nconducting student trials is bound to draw bitter resentment from the students. This is especially true when<br />\nthe campaign is conducted to the exclusion of most<br />\nother vital student services.<br />\nThe regard held for our student leaders atad student government never has been very high here at<br />\nHopkins. This year will certainly nolbe marked by any<br />\nnoticeable improvement in this lamentable situation.<br /><br />\nHopkins Reacts To Marathon Fad<br />\nWith Typical \"Neat\" Maneuver<br />\nIn the 30's it was all the rage<br />\nto go to a dance on a Saturday<br />\nevening and not return until<br />\nsometime Wednesday afternoon<br />\n\u2014and then only on a stretcher.<br />\nIn some circles this is still fashionable. But for most, the dance<br />\nmarthon is pass\u00e9. America's<br />\nyouth has taken its stamina and<br />\nidiocy to greener and more preposterous pastures.<br />\nLast week, for instance, students at three Michigan universities were vieing for the telephone talkathon title. Western<br />\nMichigan University had its<br /><br />\nstudents talking between dormitories in half hour shifts. Michigan State and Michigan were<br />\nbattling it out with no such limit.<br />\nThe Western Michigan team intends to continue its effort until<br />\nthe beginning of the Christmas<br />\nvacation \u2014 to amass a total of<br />\nfive hundred hours of non-stop<br />\nconversation and the longest<br />\nbusy signal on record.<br />\nAt the University of Pittsburgh<br />\nthe lately revived marathon<br />\ncraze took another form.

The main problem<br />\nwas the play itself, called Winterset (for some significant reason or another) by Maxwell Anderson.

Jt was a Romeo-Juliet.<br />\n'Here we are at last, after all!'<br />\nscene. As a matter of fact there<br />\nis one other point where Mr. Anderson departs from the Bard of<br />\nAvon, that is, in the character<br />\nof the judge. He was really not<br />\nwell enough drawn to be a Lear<br />\n\u2014after all Lear represents society rather than his own opinion of his role in society.<br />\nIf Mr. Anderson justified his<br />\ninterpretation of Shakespeare<br />\nphilosophically (and there is that<br />\npossibility) he most certainly<br />\ncould not stylistically.
