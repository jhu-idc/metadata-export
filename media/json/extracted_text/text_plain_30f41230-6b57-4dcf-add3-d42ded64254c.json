Ten of the new students are<br />\nHopkins graduates. There are few<br />\nchanges in the staff. Dr. W. D.<br />\nGatch and Dr. R. S. Morris are<br />\nnow in St. Louis at the reorganized<br />\nWashington University, where they<br />\nwill find a number of other former<br />\nHopkins men, summoned from all<br />\nover the country to help build up<br />\nthis promising school. Dr.Arthur H.<br />\nKoelker,formerly Associate in Physiological Chemistry, is now Chief<br />\nChemist at one of the large New<br />\nYork hospitals, and has been succeeded by Dr. Marshall. Dr. Henry<br />\nG.

The topic of the course, as<br />\nannounced in the daily papers with<br />\nstartling headlines, was \"The Proteins and their Relation to Metabolism.\"<br />\nDr. Kossel has been foremost in<br />\nthe study of the fascinating but<br />\ndifficult problems in this field, and<br />\nhis addresses (two of which were<br />\ngiven in excellent English, the third<br />\nin German) were followed with<br />\ngreat interest.<br />\nDuring the summer the various<br />\nbuilding operations about the Hospital and School went on very favorably. The Medical School tennis<br />\ncourts have been restored to their<br />\noriginal condition, following the recent regrading of the lot. On the<br />\nHospital side the Harriet Lane<br />\nHome is waiting only for the official opening; and the Phipps sychiatry Clinic is well on to completion, so that it can easily be seen<br />\nwhat an imposing addition has been<br />\nmade to the already immense quadrangle.<br />\n<br />\nThe return of the college year<br />\nrecalls Homewood\u2014long the haven<br />\nof our desires. Things seem but<br />\nslightly changed. The athletic field<br />\nis a little greener, perhaps\u2014the turf<br />\na little thicker\u2014but no new buildings astonish us or make us happy.<br />\nHowever, a closer survey makes us<br />\nsee that some things are new, and<br />\nsome things improved.<br />\nAll summer long, hundreds of<br />\ncartloads of earth have been poured<br />\non the low ground lying between<br />\nCharles street and the athletic field.<br />\nThis newly graded tract will be<br />\nused as a practice field for the<br />\nteams, but since it is still quite soft<br />\nand devoid of grass, it will not be<br />\npracticed on until next year. The<br />\nneed of such a field can be realized<br />\nby all who know the wear and tear<br />\ncaused by continual practicing:.<br />\nEven the daily \"clipping and combing\" cannot preserve the grass and<br />\nkeep the field in decent shape.<br />\nThe hammer and the saw have<br />\nbeen busy, also. Two storerooms<br />\nhave been built under the grandstand\u2014one storeroom for tools and<br />\nthe other for Manager Getz. You<br />\ncan sec the use of that storeroom<br />\nwhen one of our sturdy football<br />\nmen begins to howl, \"Oh, Getz, I<br />\nneed a shoe lace.\" Then Manager<br />\nGetz goes to his storeroom, takes<br />\nout a big key, opens a bigger lock,<br />\n\u2022 and retires within the dark and<br />\nmysterious room. In a few moments, out he comes, snaps together<br />\nthe lock, and triumphantly produces the required shoe lace.<br />\nReally, this storeroom is very<br />\nhandy!<br />\nLeading directly east from the<br />\nfootball field, a new road has been<br />\nconstructed. It goes through the<br />\nwoods, and comes out just behind<br />\nthe old Country School buildings.<br />\nThe mansion, itself, once the home<br />\nof the brother of Charles Carroll<br />\nof Carrollton, is forsaken now, and<br />\nthe frame buildings behind (which<br />\ncomplete the school group), where<br />\nthe classes were held, are even more<br />\nforlorn. These frame buildings,<br />\nwill be used, it is said, as the offices<br />\nof the builders of the new Hopkins,<br />\nand, after having served this purpose, will be torn down. Nothing<br />\nhas been done here this summer,<br />\nexcept to complete the grading in<br />\nfront of the Carroll Mansion.<br />\nFarther within the grounds, and<br />\nabout in the same line with the Carroll Mansion, is the first of the<br />\nnew buildings planned for Hopkins.<br />\nThe laboratory for plant physiology, as it is called, is built of<br />\n<br />\nThere has been little hazing thus<br />\nfar, but the attitude of the sophomores is far from reassuring, and<br />\nbodes ill for the future. The infants of 1915 are counting their<br />\nblessings in being permitted to rest<br />\nin peace so far, without any of their<br />\nnumber being compelled to do anything more exciting than run races<br />\nin their bare feet.<br />\nThis strictly novel stunt was pulled<br />\noff on Thursday, when, between<br />\nclasses, about fifty stern and strong<br />\nsophomores got four luckless fresh'<br />\nmen and took them to the Monument street end of the \"campus.\"<br />\nFirst the infants disrobed so far as<br />\nthe proprieties would allow them,<br />\nand sans coats, collars, shoes and<br />\nstockings, and with trousers rolled<br />\nup, raced down the campus and back<br />\nagain. The Druid Hill avenue end<br />\nwas unguarded, but the fifty,sophomores were wise, and knew that, in<br />\nsuch a state of deshabille, it would<br />\nbe impossible for the freshmen to<br />\nrun away and leave important parts<br />\nof their wearing apparel behind.<br />\nStill, after several of these sprints,<br />\nthe inexorable hazers were not satiated. A marathon around the block<br />\nmust needs be organized, and so<br />\nthe four freshmen, with their bare<br />\npedal extremities beating a lively<br />\ntattoo on the cold sidewalk, ran<br />\naround the block, while the members of the faculty who were at the<br />\nHopkins Club, hastened out, secured vantage points, and placed<br />\nbets.<br />\n<br />\nTennis Team Will Play City College at<br />\nHomewood Tuesday.<br />\n<br />\nCaptain Hammond of the sophomore tennis team, has arranged a<br />\nmatch with City College for Tuesday afternoon. Four sets of singles<br />\nand three sets of doubles will be<br />\nplayed. Some of the men who<br />\nplayed last year for 1914 were<br />\nHammond(captain), Riley, Powers,<br />\nCorner (manager), Geissel, Howell,<br />\nChenoweth, Rice, and Lynch.<br />\n<br />\n(Continued on page S, col. 3.)<br />\n<br />\nDr. Gatch Leaves.<br />\n<br />\nThe medical staff of Johns Hopkins Hospital lost one of the most<br />\nbrilliant and ambitious of its younger<br />\nphysicians when Dr. Willis D.<br />\nCatch left last Tuesday to accept<br />\na professorship of surgery at the<br />\nIndianapolis Medical College. Not<br />\nonly as a physician, but as an inventor, Dr. Gatch achieved grqg<br />\nsuccess during his period of service<br />\nat the Hopkins, and respect for his<br />\nability, coupled with warm personal<br />\nregard, made him a commanding<br />\nfigure among his associates.<br />\nDr. 'Gatch is 26 years old. He<br />\nreceived his degree in arts at Indiana University in 1901 and entered<br />\nthe Johns Hopkins School of Medicine the following year. In 1907<br />\nhe was given the degree of medical doctor and appointed resident<br />\nhouse officer of the hospital. \u2022 A<br />\nyear later he was made assistant<br />\nresident surgeon and anxgthetist.<br />\n<br />\nPRICE, FIVF CENTS<br />\n<br />\nNAVY DEFEATS HOPKINS<br />\nBut Black and Blue Eleven Played a<br />\nGood Game\u2014Score Was<br />\n27 to 5.<br />\n<br />\nThe Varsity football team went<br />\ndown to defeat to the tune of 27<br />\nto 5 at the hands of the Navy eleven<br />\nSaturday afternoon at Annapolis,<br />\nbut the winners had to put their<br />\nbest team on the field, and the lineup which started the game contained only three men who had not<br />\nwon their stars by playing against<br />\nthe Army. Gillet was the hero for<br />\nthe losers and when he fell on Dalton's punt, which had been blocked<br />\nby Liebensperger in the first quarter,<br />\nthe Black and Blue team did what<br />\nno aggregation was able to accomplish last season\u2014score on the<br />\nNavy.<br />\nFor the most part Hopkins played<br />\na rattling good game on a field, the<br />\ncondition of which was wretched,<br />\nand although greatly outweighed,<br />\nwas never overwhelmed. Navy on<br />\nthe other hand at times showed remarkable form, but the line was<br />\nweak in spots, and the Black and<br />\nBlue backs went through for good<br />\ngains, while the Hopkins line held<br />\nremarkably well.<br />\nThe disparity in the score was<br />\ndue, for the most part, to the way<br />\nin which Dalton and Sowell ran<br />\nback punts for the Navy and the<br />\nway the Hopkins backs failed in<br />\nthis department of the game. Gillet, who did most of the booting<br />\nfor the visitors, sent the ball for<br />\ngood distances, but the Navy backs,<br />\naided by clever interferences, succeeded in gaining from Jo to 25<br />\nyards each try. Hopkins, on the<br />\nother hand, when Navy was about<br />\nto punt, only had one man back to<br />\nreceive the ball, and when Gilchrist<br />\nand Hamilton got by their opposing<br />\nends, as was often the case, the<br />\nBlack and Blue eleven couldn't gain.<br />\nSeveral times, the punts went far<br />\nbeyond the region where the receiving back was playing, and twice<br />\nthese mistakes resulted in touchdowns for Navy.<br />\nFirst blood was drawn early in<br />\nthe -first quarter when Hopkins lost<br />\nthe ball On a forward pass to Gillet, which went out of bounds,<br />\nalthough decisions like this were<br />\nvery difficult to make as the field<br />\nwas absolutely unmarked and the<br />\nposition of the side lines had to be<br />\nguessed at. Navy then got the ball<br />\non the Hopkins 30-yard line and<br />\nstarted down the field with steady<br />\ngains. Dalton got away around<br />\nleft end for a pretty run of 15<br />\nyards, and this put the ball within<br />\neasy striking distance. Sowell went<br />\nthrough center on a stimulated run<br />\n<br />\n\fIfkrertl*7<br />\n<br />\nhistoin<br />\n2<br />\n<br />\nTHE NEWS\u2014LETTER, OCTOBER 9, 1911.<br />\n<br />\naround end, a fake that was worked<br />\nby the Navy several times to great<br />\nadvantage. Brown kicked goal.<br />\nThe game which was put up by<br />\nthe Sailors was far from clean, and<br />\nfive penalties were levied by the<br />\nreferee for holding. One of these<br />\nrobbed the winners of a good gain<br />\njust after the first score had been<br />\nmade, when Dalton caught a punt<br />\nand got around left-end for a spectacular run of 6o yards, being halted<br />\non the 15-yard line by Branham,<br />\nwho made a game tackle. Dalton<br />\nwas brought back and his team penalized. This put the ball on Navy's<br />\n20-yard line, and when Dalton attempted to punt down the field<br />\nLiebensperger broke through the<br />\nopposing line and blocked the ball,<br />\nwhich went far behind the goal<br />\nposts. Gillet fell on it and Hopkins scored.<br />\nFulton punted out successfully,<br />\nbut his try for a goal failed.<br />\nIn the second quarter the superiority of the Sailors in running back<br />\npunts was marked, and was responsible for their second score. Dalton<br />\nreceived a punt on the 40-yard line<br />\nand ran down to within five feet of<br />\ngoal, Musser making the tackle, and<br />\nalthough the Hopkins line held well<br />\nwhen Navy tried right tackle, Dalton was sent through left for a<br />\ntouchdown and kicked goal.<br />\nIt was in this session that Hopkins had its greatest chance to equalize the score. Gillet punted from<br />\nmidfield and Pieper raced down and<br />\ngot the ball on the second bound,<br />\nafter it had gotten away from<br />\nSowell. He kept on to within io<br />\nyards of goal, and on the first play,<br />\nwhen Navy was off side and penalized, the Hopkins chances were<br />\nbright. Pieper was sent against<br />\ncenter, but the sheer weight of the<br />\nopposing line sent him back five<br />\nyards. Then a run around left end,<br />\nwith a double pass, was essayed. A<br />\nfumble resulted, but Pieper recovered the pigskin, and from the 35yard line Fulton tried a drop-kick,<br />\nbut this was blocked. The wind<br />\nwas blowing a gale all through the<br />\ngame, and Dalton, who had seven<br />\ntries in the Army game last year<br />\nbefore he succeeded in getting one<br />\nover, only attempted one such play<br />\nyesterday, and then it went wide.<br />\nIn the second half the weight of<br />\nthe'Navy line began to tell, and<br />\ntheir advantage in handling punts<br />\nwas more noticeable. Sowell scored<br />\nwithin three minutes after Dalton<br />\nhad gotten the ball within striking<br />\ndistance, but the latter failed at goal.<br />\nThe ball remained in Hopkins territory most of this quarter, and<br />\nbarely had the whistle sounded for<br />\nthe last session to begin when the<br />\nvisitors fumbled a punt on their 10yard line and Dalton was sent over.<br />\nThe same thing happened three minutes later, when Hopkins again<br />\nfailed to handle the ball, and this<br />\ntime Dickens made the score for<br />\nthe Navy. Both the last attempts<br />\nat goal failed.<br />\nThe game developed astonishing<br />\nstrength for Hopkins in all depart(Contillzted on page 6, col. 3.)<br />\n<br />\nDR.

Folwell has been<br />\nworking hard during the past week<br />\nto get the men in shape in the short<br />\ntime that they have had to prepare<br />\nfor so difficult a game as the one<br />\nagainst the Navy, but the fact that<br />\na football man of national fame was<br />\npresent here on the job was kept<br />\na secret, as it was desired not to let<br />\nthe ,Navy know the local boys were<br />\ngetting the advantage of his coaching.<br />\n,Folwell is a raw-boned, muscular<br />\nman of slightly more than medium<br />\nheight, with high cheek bones and<br />\na commanding voice which penetrates to every part of the field.<br />\nThis tousle-headed, earnest-minded<br />\nman, who rarely ever smiles and<br />\nfrom whom the few words of encouragement are like pearls of precious price to the anxious players,<br />\nwas for three years left halfback of<br />\npile of the greatest of the University of Pennsylvania's football teams<br />\nand for the past two years coach<br />\nof the Lafayette College. \u2022<br />\nWith Folwell coaching is a matter of serious business, and when<br />\nhe is on the field there is nothing<br />\n. more important in the affairs of the<br />\n\u2022 nation to his vision than the drilling of the boys before him.

It was decided then<br />\nby the Board of Editors that the<br />\nneeds of the University, student<br />\nbody and alumni, was not for a depository of out-of-date news, and<br />\npseudo literary contributions which<br />\nwere not fit to find a resting place<br />\nelsewhere. The editors thought<br />\nthat a real, live newspaper, appearing on time, containing items of<br />\ninterest about past happenings, adequately forecasting those which<br />\nwere to come, and providing a forurn for the discussion of questions of<br />\ninterest to those connected with the<br />\nUniversity, was what was needed,<br />\nand so THE NMS-LETTER started to<br />\nmake its appearance, in a new form,<br />\non the Monday of each week.<br />\nThat this change was for the best<br />\nhas been abundantly demonstrated<br />\nby the way the paper has been supported. Its circulation has increased<br />\n800 per cent.; the advertising revenue has been more than tripled, and<br />\nletters of commendation have come<br />\nfrom all parts of the country. For<br />\nthis year it is proposed to conduct<br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER along these same<br />\nlines which have proven so successful. Some innovations will be made,<br />\nbut nothing radical is contemplated.<br />\n<br />\nWe will try to be conservative, not<br />\nyellow.<br />\nYet it is the aim of the editors<br />\nnot to be too conservative and Se(late. From time to time, new humorous features will be introduced;<br />\nthe news of familiar happenings will<br />\nbe reduced to a minimum, and most<br />\nof the space will be devoted to a<br />\ndiscussion of those questions which<br />\nare unfamiliar, or at least not hackneyed. All of the accounts will be<br />\ncolored in such a way that a pleasant hour reading THE NEWS-LETTER<br />\nwill be furnished weekly to all the<br />\nsubscribers.<br />\nA publication such as this one,<br />\nis not issued for the exploitation of<br />\nthe literary ability of those who<br />\nmay happen to be the editors. It<br />\nis issued because, if conducted<br />\nrightly, it can be of real service to<br />\nthe University, her alumni, faculty,<br />\nand students. And to be of service<br />\nwill be the constant aim of THE<br />\nNEws-LETTER. We, the editors,<br />\nwant to make it worthy of the Johns<br />\nHopkins University; we want to<br />\ncultivate a stronger feeling of loyalty among the students. We want<br />\nto make the relations between the<br />\nfaculty and the students, and between the alumni and the University,<br />\ncloser and more pleasant.

Virginia won its opening game by the phenomenal score<br />\nof 81 to o. This clearly proves that<br />\nthe Charlottesville boys are living<br />\nup to their past reputations as crack<br />\nfootball players. Gettysburg, while<br />\nnot so well known as Navy and<br />\nVirginia, is, nevertheless, a very<br />\nstrong team. The University of<br />\nPennsylvania had a very hard time<br />\ndefeating the Gettysburg 'eleven a<br />\nweek ago and only nosed out a<br />\nvictory by the close score of 5 to 3.<br />\nAs can be seen from the accompanying schedule, all the games<br />\nexcept that with Navy last Saturday, and the one with Stevens on<br />\nthe coming Saturday, will be played,<br />\nat Homewood. This will give Hopkins students and Hopkins supporters seven weeks of uninter7,<br />\nrupted football at home which,from<br />\nthe progress made so far, is certain<br />\nto be of a higher quality than any<br />\never played at Homewood heretofore.<br />\n. Big crowds are expected at all<br />\nthe home games. The Hopkins<br />\nteams are rapidly gaining favor<br />\namong the Baltimore lovers of<br />\nsport, and the attendance is becoming larger each season. Certain<br />\nseats will be reserved only at the<br />\nUniversity of Virginia, St. John's<br />\nand Carlisle Indian games, and the<br />\nextra charge will be but twenty-five<br />\ncents instead of fifty cents as heretofore.

The topic of the course, as<br />\nannounced in the daily papers with<br />\nstartling headlines, was \"The Proteins and their Relation to Metabolism.\"<br />\nDr. Kossel has been foremost in<br />\nthe study of the fascinating but<br />\ndifficult problems in this field, and<br />\nhis addresses (two of which were<br />\ngiven in excellent English, the third<br />\nin German) were followed with<br />\ngreat interest.<br />\nDuring the summer the various<br />\nbuilding operations about the Hospital and School went on very favorably. The Medical School tennis<br />\ncourts have been restored to their<br />\noriginal condition, following the recent regrading of the lot. On the<br />\nHospital side the Harriet Lane<br />\nHome is waiting only for the official opening; and the Phipps sychiatry Clinic is well on to completion, so that it can easily be seen<br />\nwhat an imposing addition has been<br />\nmade to the already immense quadrangle.<br /><br />\nThe return of the college year<br />\nrecalls Homewood\u2014long the haven<br />\nof our desires.

The athletic field<br />\nis a little greener, perhaps\u2014the turf<br />\na little thicker\u2014but no new buildings astonish us or make us happy.<br />\nHowever, a closer survey makes us<br />\nsee that some things are new, and<br />\nsome things improved.<br />\nAll summer long, hundreds of<br />\ncartloads of earth have been poured<br />\non the low ground lying between<br />\nCharles street and the athletic field.<br />\nThis newly graded tract will be<br />\nused as a practice field for the<br />\nteams, but since it is still quite soft<br />\nand devoid of grass, it will not be<br />\npracticed on until next year. The<br />\nneed of such a field can be realized<br />\nby all who know the wear and tear<br />\ncaused by continual practicing:.<br />\nEven the daily \"clipping and combing\" cannot preserve the grass and<br />\nkeep the field in decent shape.<br />\nThe hammer and the saw have<br />\nbeen busy, also. Two storerooms<br />\nhave been built under the grandstand\u2014one storeroom for tools and<br />\nthe other for Manager Getz. You<br />\ncan sec the use of that storeroom<br />\nwhen one of our sturdy football<br />\nmen begins to howl, \"Oh, Getz, I<br />\nneed a shoe lace.\" Then Manager<br />\nGetz goes to his storeroom, takes<br />\nout a big key, opens a bigger lock,<br />\n\u2022 and retires within the dark and<br />\nmysterious room. In a few moments, out he comes, snaps together<br />\nthe lock, and triumphantly produces the required shoe lace.<br />\nReally, this storeroom is very<br />\nhandy!<br />\nLeading directly east from the<br />\nfootball field, a new road has been<br />\nconstructed. It goes through the<br />\nwoods, and comes out just behind<br />\nthe old Country School buildings.<br />\nThe mansion, itself, once the home<br />\nof the brother of Charles Carroll<br />\nof Carrollton, is forsaken now, and<br />\nthe frame buildings behind (which<br />\ncomplete the school group), where<br />\nthe classes were held, are even more<br />\nforlorn. These frame buildings,<br />\nwill be used, it is said, as the offices<br />\nof the builders of the new Hopkins,<br />\nand, after having served this purpose, will be torn down.

The infants of 1915 are counting their<br />\nblessings in being permitted to rest<br />\nin peace so far, without any of their<br />\nnumber being compelled to do anything more exciting than run races<br />\nin their bare feet.<br />\nThis strictly novel stunt was pulled<br />\noff on Thursday, when, between<br />\nclasses, about fifty stern and strong<br />\nsophomores got four luckless fresh'<br />\nmen and took them to the Monument street end of the \"campus.\"<br />\nFirst the infants disrobed so far as<br />\nthe proprieties would allow them,<br />\nand sans coats, collars, shoes and<br />\nstockings, and with trousers rolled<br />\nup, raced down the campus and back<br />\nagain. The Druid Hill avenue end<br />\nwas unguarded, but the fifty,sophomores were wise, and knew that, in<br />\nsuch a state of deshabille, it would<br />\nbe impossible for the freshmen to<br />\nrun away and leave important parts<br />\nof their wearing apparel behind.<br />\nStill, after several of these sprints,<br />\nthe inexorable hazers were not satiated. A marathon around the block<br />\nmust needs be organized, and so<br />\nthe four freshmen, with their bare<br />\npedal extremities beating a lively<br />\ntattoo on the cold sidewalk, ran<br />\naround the block, while the members of the faculty who were at the<br />\nHopkins Club, hastened out, secured vantage points, and placed<br />\nbets.<br /><br />\nTennis Team Will Play City College at<br />\nHomewood Tuesday.<br /><br />\nCaptain Hammond of the sophomore tennis team, has arranged a<br />\nmatch with City College for Tuesday afternoon. Four sets of singles<br />\nand three sets of doubles will be<br />\nplayed.

Not<br />\nonly as a physician, but as an inventor, Dr. Gatch achieved grqg<br />\nsuccess during his period of service<br />\nat the Hopkins, and respect for his<br />\nability, coupled with warm personal<br />\nregard, made him a commanding<br />\nfigure among his associates.<br />\nDr. 'Gatch is 26 years old. He<br />\nreceived his degree in arts at Indiana University in 1901 and entered<br />\nthe Johns Hopkins School of Medicine the following year. In 1907<br />\nhe was given the degree of medical doctor and appointed resident<br />\nhouse officer of the hospital. \u2022 A<br />\nyear later he was made assistant<br />\nresident surgeon and anxgthetist.<br /><br />\nPRICE, FIVF CENTS<br /><br />\nNAVY DEFEATS HOPKINS<br />\nBut Black and Blue Eleven Played a<br />\nGood Game\u2014Score Was<br />\n27 to 5.<br /><br />\nThe Varsity football team went<br />\ndown to defeat to the tune of 27<br />\nto 5 at the hands of the Navy eleven<br />\nSaturday afternoon at Annapolis,<br />\nbut the winners had to put their<br />\nbest team on the field, and the lineup which started the game contained only three men who had not<br />\nwon their stars by playing against<br />\nthe Army. Gillet was the hero for<br />\nthe losers and when he fell on Dalton's punt, which had been blocked<br />\nby Liebensperger in the first quarter,<br />\nthe Black and Blue team did what<br />\nno aggregation was able to accomplish last season\u2014score on the<br />\nNavy.<br />\nFor the most part Hopkins played<br />\na rattling good game on a field, the<br />\ncondition of which was wretched,<br />\nand although greatly outweighed,<br />\nwas never overwhelmed. Navy on<br />\nthe other hand at times showed remarkable form, but the line was<br />\nweak in spots, and the Black and<br />\nBlue backs went through for good<br />\ngains, while the Hopkins line held<br />\nremarkably well.<br />\nThe disparity in the score was<br />\ndue, for the most part, to the way<br />\nin which Dalton and Sowell ran<br />\nback punts for the Navy and the<br />\nway the Hopkins backs failed in<br />\nthis department of the game. Gillet, who did most of the booting<br />\nfor the visitors, sent the ball for<br />\ngood distances, but the Navy backs,<br />\naided by clever interferences, succeeded in gaining from Jo to 25<br />\nyards each try. Hopkins, on the<br />\nother hand, when Navy was about<br />\nto punt, only had one man back to<br />\nreceive the ball, and when Gilchrist<br />\nand Hamilton got by their opposing<br />\nends, as was often the case, the<br />\nBlack and Blue eleven couldn't gain.<br />\nSeveral times, the punts went far<br />\nbeyond the region where the receiving back was playing, and twice<br />\nthese mistakes resulted in touchdowns for Navy.<br />\nFirst blood was drawn early in<br />\nthe -first quarter when Hopkins lost<br />\nthe ball On a forward pass to Gillet, which went out of bounds,<br />\nalthough decisions like this were<br />\nvery difficult to make as the field<br />\nwas absolutely unmarked and the<br />\nposition of the side lines had to be<br />\nguessed at. Navy then got the ball<br />\non the Hopkins 30-yard line and<br />\nstarted down the field with steady<br />\ngains. Dalton got away around<br />\nleft end for a pretty run of 15<br />\nyards, and this put the ball within<br />\neasy striking distance. Sowell went<br />\nthrough center on a stimulated run<br /><br />\nIfkrertl*7<br /><br />\nhistoin<br />\n2<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS\u2014LETTER, OCTOBER 9, 1911.<br /><br />\naround end, a fake that was worked<br />\nby the Navy several times to great<br />\nadvantage. Brown kicked goal.<br />\nThe game which was put up by<br />\nthe Sailors was far from clean, and<br />\nfive penalties were levied by the<br />\nreferee for holding. One of these<br />\nrobbed the winners of a good gain<br />\njust after the first score had been<br />\nmade, when Dalton caught a punt<br />\nand got around left-end for a spectacular run of 6o yards, being halted<br />\non the 15-yard line by Branham,<br />\nwho made a game tackle. Dalton<br />\nwas brought back and his team penalized. This put the ball on Navy's<br />\n20-yard line, and when Dalton attempted to punt down the field<br />\nLiebensperger broke through the<br />\nopposing line and blocked the ball,<br />\nwhich went far behind the goal<br />\nposts. Gillet fell on it and Hopkins scored.<br />\nFulton punted out successfully,<br />\nbut his try for a goal failed.<br />\nIn the second quarter the superiority of the Sailors in running back<br />\npunts was marked, and was responsible for their second score. Dalton<br />\nreceived a punt on the 40-yard line<br />\nand ran down to within five feet of<br />\ngoal, Musser making the tackle, and<br />\nalthough the Hopkins line held well<br />\nwhen Navy tried right tackle, Dalton was sent through left for a<br />\ntouchdown and kicked goal.<br />\nIt was in this session that Hopkins had its greatest chance to equalize the score. Gillet punted from<br />\nmidfield and Pieper raced down and<br />\ngot the ball on the second bound,<br />\nafter it had gotten away from<br />\nSowell. He kept on to within io<br />\nyards of goal, and on the first play,<br />\nwhen Navy was off side and penalized, the Hopkins chances were<br />\nbright. Pieper was sent against<br />\ncenter, but the sheer weight of the<br />\nopposing line sent him back five<br />\nyards. Then a run around left end,<br />\nwith a double pass, was essayed. A<br />\nfumble resulted, but Pieper recovered the pigskin, and from the 35yard line Fulton tried a drop-kick,<br />\nbut this was blocked. The wind<br />\nwas blowing a gale all through the<br />\ngame, and Dalton, who had seven<br />\ntries in the Army game last year<br />\nbefore he succeeded in getting one<br />\nover, only attempted one such play<br />\nyesterday, and then it went wide.<br />\nIn the second half the weight of<br />\nthe'Navy line began to tell, and<br />\ntheir advantage in handling punts<br />\nwas more noticeable. Sowell scored<br />\nwithin three minutes after Dalton<br />\nhad gotten the ball within striking<br />\ndistance, but the latter failed at goal.<br />\nThe ball remained in Hopkins territory most of this quarter, and<br />\nbarely had the whistle sounded for<br />\nthe last session to begin when the<br />\nvisitors fumbled a punt on their 10yard line and Dalton was sent over.<br />\nThe same thing happened three minutes later, when Hopkins again<br />\nfailed to handle the ball, and this<br />\ntime Dickens made the score for<br />\nthe Navy. Both the last attempts<br />\nat goal failed.<br />\nThe game developed astonishing<br />\nstrength for Hopkins in all depart(Contillzted on page 6, col. 3.)<br /><br />\nDR.

Folwell has been<br />\nworking hard during the past week<br />\nto get the men in shape in the short<br />\ntime that they have had to prepare<br />\nfor so difficult a game as the one<br />\nagainst the Navy, but the fact that<br />\na football man of national fame was<br />\npresent here on the job was kept<br />\na secret, as it was desired not to let<br />\nthe ,Navy know the local boys were<br />\ngetting the advantage of his coaching.<br />\n,Folwell is a raw-boned, muscular<br />\nman of slightly more than medium<br />\nheight, with high cheek bones and<br />\na commanding voice which penetrates to every part of the field.<br />\nThis tousle-headed, earnest-minded<br />\nman, who rarely ever smiles and<br />\nfrom whom the few words of encouragement are like pearls of precious price to the anxious players,<br />\nwas for three years left halfback of<br />\npile of the greatest of the University of Pennsylvania's football teams<br />\nand for the past two years coach<br />\nof the Lafayette College. \u2022<br />\nWith Folwell coaching is a matter of serious business, and when<br />\nhe is on the field there is nothing<br />\n. more important in the affairs of the<br />\n\u2022 nation to his vision than the drilling of the boys before him.

It was decided then<br />\nby the Board of Editors that the<br />\nneeds of the University, student<br />\nbody and alumni, was not for a depository of out-of-date news, and<br />\npseudo literary contributions which<br />\nwere not fit to find a resting place<br />\nelsewhere. The editors thought<br />\nthat a real, live newspaper, appearing on time, containing items of<br />\ninterest about past happenings, adequately forecasting those which<br />\nwere to come, and providing a forurn for the discussion of questions of<br />\ninterest to those connected with the<br />\nUniversity, was what was needed,<br />\nand so THE NMS-LETTER started to<br />\nmake its appearance, in a new form,<br />\non the Monday of each week.<br />\nThat this change was for the best<br />\nhas been abundantly demonstrated<br />\nby the way the paper has been supported. Its circulation has increased<br />\n800 per cent.; the advertising revenue has been more than tripled, and<br />\nletters of commendation have come<br />\nfrom all parts of the country. For<br />\nthis year it is proposed to conduct<br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER along these same<br />\nlines which have proven so successful. Some innovations will be made,<br />\nbut nothing radical is contemplated.<br /><br />\nWe will try to be conservative, not<br />\nyellow.<br />\nYet it is the aim of the editors<br />\nnot to be too conservative and Se(late. From time to time, new humorous features will be introduced;<br />\nthe news of familiar happenings will<br />\nbe reduced to a minimum, and most<br />\nof the space will be devoted to a<br />\ndiscussion of those questions which<br />\nare unfamiliar, or at least not hackneyed. All of the accounts will be<br />\ncolored in such a way that a pleasant hour reading THE NEWS-LETTER<br />\nwill be furnished weekly to all the<br />\nsubscribers.<br />\nA publication such as this one,<br />\nis not issued for the exploitation of<br />\nthe literary ability of those who<br />\nmay happen to be the editors. It<br />\nis issued because, if conducted<br />\nrightly, it can be of real service to<br />\nthe University, her alumni, faculty,<br />\nand students. And to be of service<br />\nwill be the constant aim of THE<br />\nNEws-LETTER. We, the editors,<br />\nwant to make it worthy of the Johns<br />\nHopkins University; we want to<br />\ncultivate a stronger feeling of loyalty among the students. We want<br />\nto make the relations between the<br />\nfaculty and the students, and between the alumni and the University,<br />\ncloser and more pleasant.

Virginia won its opening game by the phenomenal score<br />\nof 81 to o. This clearly proves that<br />\nthe Charlottesville boys are living<br />\nup to their past reputations as crack<br />\nfootball players. Gettysburg, while<br />\nnot so well known as Navy and<br />\nVirginia, is, nevertheless, a very<br />\nstrong team. The University of<br />\nPennsylvania had a very hard time<br />\ndefeating the Gettysburg 'eleven a<br />\nweek ago and only nosed out a<br />\nvictory by the close score of 5 to 3.<br />\nAs can be seen from the accompanying schedule, all the games<br />\nexcept that with Navy last Saturday, and the one with Stevens on<br />\nthe coming Saturday, will be played,<br />\nat Homewood. This will give Hopkins students and Hopkins supporters seven weeks of uninter7,<br />\nrupted football at home which,from<br />\nthe progress made so far, is certain<br />\nto be of a higher quality than any<br />\never played at Homewood heretofore.<br />\n. Big crowds are expected at all<br />\nthe home games. The Hopkins<br />\nteams are rapidly gaining favor<br />\namong the Baltimore lovers of<br />\nsport, and the attendance is becoming larger each season. Certain<br />\nseats will be reserved only at the<br />\nUniversity of Virginia, St. John's<br />\nand Carlisle Indian games, and the<br />\nextra charge will be but twenty-five<br />\ncents instead of fifty cents as heretofore.
