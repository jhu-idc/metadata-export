His successor, who has been recently appointed, is<br />\nDr. Robert Bruce Roulston. Dr. Roulston<br />\ngraduated from Johns Hopkins in 1900; he<br />\ncontinued his work in German, and held a<br />\nFellowship in 1902-1903. He also studied at<br />\nthe University of Berlin (1904-1905), and<br />\nfinally obtained his doctorate at Johns Hopkins<br />\nin 1906. Dr. Roulston has an extremely interesting personality, and his descriptions of<br />\nstudent-life in Germany are particularly vivid.<br />\nHe has been head of the German department at<br />\nthe Baltimore Country Schools for Boys for the<br />\nlast two years, and has proved a great<br />\nfavorite with his students.<br />\n<br />\nA WORD ABOUT THE JUNIOR BANQUET<br />\nThe NEWS-LETTER, being the publication<br />\nof the Undergraduates, feels that, in matters<br />\nconcerning two of the classes, it should take<br />\nsome 'definite position. At present there is a<br />\nquestion as to who shall pay for the damage<br />\ncaused at the Junior banquet through the<br />\ninterference of the Freshmen. As the Editorial<br />\nBoard is comprised almost entirely of Juniors,<br />\nour opinion may be regarded with some suspicion, but we shall try to give the view which<br />\noccurs to us as indicating the only proper<br />\ncourse to take at the present time.<br />\nWe will try to sum up briefly the facts in<br />\nthe case: (1), The Juniors had rented the<br />\nhall, had several captive Freshmen seated at<br />\nthe table and considered themselves in security.<br />\n(2), An employee of the hotel had been stationed at the door, instructed to admit Seniors<br />\nand Juniors only. (3), The Freshmen obtained admission because the door-keeper was<br />\ntold by the Seniors to admit them as being<br />\nexpected. (4), Without the protection and<br />\ninterference on the part of the Seniors, no<br />\nfracas would have occurred. (5), The Seniors<br />\ncertainly would not have acted as they did, if<br />\nthe sentiment of their class had been against<br />\nso doing. (6), The Seniors probably protected and egged on the Freshmen because the<br />\nsentiment of their class was to act in this way.<br />\n(7), No damage would have been done if the<br />\nFreshmen had not made an attempt to rescue<br />\ntheir men by force. (8), The question as to<br />\nwhether the policy of the Seniors was in<br />\naccordance with the traditions of the University is by no means certain.<br />\nUnder these circumstances it is evident that<br />\nall the classes have been at fault in some particular: (1), The Seniors, for acting in away<br />\nwhich no other Seniors have done under<br />\nsimilar circumstances, and evidently causing<br />\nthe damage by allowing the trouble to take<br />\nplace. .(2), The Juniors, for holding captive<br />\ncertain Freshmen, a fault which is perhaps<br />\nexcusable, and (3), The Freshman, for making<br />\nan entry by force into a place where they had<br />\nno right to be.<br />\nIt does not seem fair for the Juniors to pay<br />\nfor the damage merely because they had rented<br />\nthe hall; nor is it right for the Freshman to pay<br />\nfor the entire loss, as they acted in a manner<br />\nperfectly natural under the circumstances.<br />\n<br />\n\fTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\n<br />\nThe Seniors, on whom the whole blame might<br />\nbe shifted for the affair having ever taking<br />\nplace at all, would refuse to pay $145 for an<br />\nindiscretion on the part of some of its members.<br />\nUnder these conditions, what is the best<br />\npolicy to adopt? It is very doubtful if any<br />\none of the three classes either would or could<br />\npay the full bill for damages. We suggest<br />\nthat every Undergraduate he called on to pay<br />\nEke amount of one dollar. Owing to the difficulty of collecting this sum from each man,<br />\nand since the breakage is due to the action of<br />\nrepresentatives of all three classes, we suggest<br />\nthat this amount be substracted from each<br />\nman's caUtion money. Those who are opposed<br />\nto this plan may make themselves audible at<br />\nthe next class meeting.<br />\nSurely this is a plan which is, at least,<br />\npractical, and would tend to do away with any<br />\nill-feeling between members of different classes<br />\nin a matter in which it is evident all have<br />\nmade mistakes to a greater or less degree.<br />\nSomeone once said: 'Those who dance should<br />\nplay the fiddler.\" Seniors, Juniors and Freshmen all 'danced\" on the night of the banquet.<br />\nLet everyone, then, join in to pay the fiddler.<br />\nHopkins is too small to have any amount of<br />\nclass squabbles. Let us avoid ill-feeling on<br />\nany subject.<br />\n<br />\n5<br />\n<br />\n'02.<br />\nSol Strouse has hung out a doctor's sign<br />\nhere.

Its object is \"to encourage<br />\nsincere and effective public speaking.\" No<br />\nperson is elligable to membership until he has<br />\nactually participated in an intercollegiate contest of debate or of oratory. To quote from<br />\nthe folder: \"Many of the most ambitious,<br />\nenergetic and capable men . . . . in college<br />\ndevote much time to oratory and debate,<br />\nthereby sacrificing frequently an opportunity<br />\nto make football or baseball teams; to make<br />\nPhi Beta Kappa; to win scholarships and other<br />\ncollegiate honors.\" It is to provide a reward<br />\nfor such men that the new society has been<br />\nstarted. The writer of the \"manifesto\" at<br />\nhand is, perhaps, a little to confident in the<br />\nfuture glories of Delta Sigma Rho. Speaking<br />\nof the society he writes: \"Wherever and<br />\nwhenever men are looking for ability and<br />\nleadership, for cultivated minds and strong<br />\nwills, for initiative, energy and integrity,<br />\nhither they will turn first.\" That is pretty<br />\n<br />\nMR. INRMANN J. HUGHIN.<br />\n<br />\nstrong. We have known the above qualities<br />\nto be the partial possession of men even who<br />\ndid not wear the Key of Phi Beta Kappa!<br />\nNeverthelesss, the new society is to be commended to the investigation of all who are<br />\ninterested in public speaking and debates.<br />\n<br />\nBy recent amalgamation with the Society of<br />\nGamma Alpha the Alpha Chapter of Alpha<br />\nDelta Epsilon becomes the Johns Hopkins<br />\nUniversity Chapter of the Gamma Alpha<br />\nGraduate Scientific Fraternity.<br />\nGamma Alpha was organized at Cornell<br />\nUniversity in the fall of 1899, and had also<br />\nplaced a chapter at Chicago University.<br />\nAlpha Delta Epsilon was founded at Johns<br />\nHopkins University in the fall of 1905 and<br />\nhad a chapter at Dartmouth. The aims of<br />\nthe two organizations were identical\u2014that of<br />\nbringing .together in the various centers of<br />\nresearch graduate students and members of<br />\nthe staff who were doing scientific work and<br />\nof promoting a true fraternal spirit among<br />\nthem, and it therefore seemed best to all concerned to unite forces.<br />\nThe society, though closely limited as to<br />\nmembership, is wholly non-secret, and in nowise enters the field of any existing organization.<br />\n<br />\n\fTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\n<br />\n7<br />\n<br />\nTHE JOHNS HOPKINS\u2014VIRGINIA<br />\nDEBATE.<br />\nThe last of a series of three debates between<br />\nthe Johns Hopkins University and the University of Virginia was held Friday, April 3,<br />\nin Madison Hall of the University of Virginia.<br />\nThe question debated was,\"Resolved, that<br />\nnational banks should be permitted to issue,<br />\nsubject to a tax and government supervision,<br />\nnotes, based on their general assets.\"<br />\nAfter much dissatisfaction three judges were<br />\nfinally obtained, who bore the responsibility<br />\nof rendering favor to whom favor was due,<br />\nhonor to whom honor was due, and decision<br />\nto whom decision was due.<br />\nVirginia had the affirmative of the question<br />\nand was represented by :<br />\nThomas S.

The Freshmen had been practicing<br />\nfaithfully for two or three weeks and had had<br />\nthe advantage of two practice games. The<br />\nconsequent team work and condition was more<br />\nthan enough to overcome the little superiority<br />\nin individual playing the Juniors might have<br />\nhad.<br />\nGreat credit is due the Freshmen for their<br />\nperformance, and in the same degree should<br />\nthe Juniors feel their defeat. Had they displayed a little, just a little, teamwork to show<br />\nthat they had made some attempt to work for<br />\nthe game the defeat would not be so disgraceful.<br />\n<br />\nHOPKINS, 6\u2014NAVY, 1.<br />\nThe game with the Navy was decidedly not<br />\nall that one could wish. From a Navy standpoint it was very creditable, but from our<br />\n<br />\nstandpoint it was not eminently so. Our fellows journeyed to Annapolis with the idea<br />\nthat, as long as it was Navy's first game,<br />\nthere wouldn't be much trouble scoring goals,<br />\nand there would be plently of glory for everyone. This idea, coupled with one or two<br />\nother factors, was instrumental in making the<br />\nloyal Hopkins rooters on the sidelines feel<br />\nanything but satisfied. Our team expected an<br />\neasy game and were fooled, for the way Navy<br />\nstarted off with a rush soon demonstrated the<br />\nfact that they were a bunch of fighters, with<br />\nthe same Navy spirit.<br />\nThe game showed that, while stick-work is<br />\nessential to a good lacrosse team, still a good<br />\nfighting spirit can go a long way toward<br />\nmaking up for defects in stick-handling.<br />\nThese sailors were in the game from start to<br />\nfinish, and completely surprised the fellows<br />\nfrom Baltimore. The goal scored by them<br />\nwas a clean, well-deserved goal, and no fluke.<br />\nTheir anxiety to play hard was, at times,<br />\nworked to disadvantage on their defense, for,<br />\nby their rushing so hard, our attack could<br />\ndodge almost at will. They have been quick<br />\nto learn, and if they only keep it up for a year<br />\nor so, Hopkins will have as hard a time to<br />\ndefeat Navy as they do to lick Swarthmore.<br />\nUnfortunately, the field was rather small,<br />\n<br />\n\f416<br />\n<br />\n10<br />\n<br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\n<br />\nand gave but a poor opportunity for the Hopkins play to show up as it would unquestionably have done on a larger and more level<br />\nfield. The game was played early in the<br />\nafternoon, right after dinner, and those par<br />\nsnip fritters, with which some of our fellows<br />\nregaled themselves, got in their destructive<br />\nwork, as Charlie Mathias 'will testify. AltoIS THE<br />\ngether, the team did not play well, but the<br />\nabsence of Meyer, on the defence, the fact<br />\nthat there had been no line-up for a week, and<br />\nthe knowledge ihat it was Navy's first game,<br />\nall worked together to bring about the result,<br />\nFOR SMOKERS<br />\nfamiliar to everyone.

His successor, who has been recently appointed, is<br />\nDr. Robert Bruce Roulston. Dr. Roulston<br />\ngraduated from Johns Hopkins in 1900; he<br />\ncontinued his work in German, and held a<br />\nFellowship in 1902-1903. He also studied at<br />\nthe University of Berlin (1904-1905), and<br />\nfinally obtained his doctorate at Johns Hopkins<br />\nin 1906. Dr. Roulston has an extremely interesting personality, and his descriptions of<br />\nstudent-life in Germany are particularly vivid.<br />\nHe has been head of the German department at<br />\nthe Baltimore Country Schools for Boys for the<br />\nlast two years, and has proved a great<br />\nfavorite with his students.<br /><br />\nA WORD ABOUT THE JUNIOR BANQUET<br />\nThe NEWS-LETTER, being the publication<br />\nof the Undergraduates, feels that, in matters<br />\nconcerning two of the classes, it should take<br />\nsome 'definite position. At present there is a<br />\nquestion as to who shall pay for the damage<br />\ncaused at the Junior banquet through the<br />\ninterference of the Freshmen. As the Editorial<br />\nBoard is comprised almost entirely of Juniors,<br />\nour opinion may be regarded with some suspicion, but we shall try to give the view which<br />\noccurs to us as indicating the only proper<br />\ncourse to take at the present time.<br />\nWe will try to sum up briefly the facts in<br />\nthe case: (1), The Juniors had rented the<br />\nhall, had several captive Freshmen seated at<br />\nthe table and considered themselves in security.<br />\n(2), An employee of the hotel had been stationed at the door, instructed to admit Seniors<br />\nand Juniors only. (3), The Freshmen obtained admission because the door-keeper was<br />\ntold by the Seniors to admit them as being<br />\nexpected. (4), Without the protection and<br />\ninterference on the part of the Seniors, no<br />\nfracas would have occurred. (5), The Seniors<br />\ncertainly would not have acted as they did, if<br />\nthe sentiment of their class had been against<br />\nso doing. (6), The Seniors probably protected and egged on the Freshmen because the<br />\nsentiment of their class was to act in this way.<br />\n(7), No damage would have been done if the<br />\nFreshmen had not made an attempt to rescue<br />\ntheir men by force. (8), The question as to<br />\nwhether the policy of the Seniors was in<br />\naccordance with the traditions of the University is by no means certain.<br />\nUnder these circumstances it is evident that<br />\nall the classes have been at fault in some particular: (1), The Seniors, for acting in away<br />\nwhich no other Seniors have done under<br />\nsimilar circumstances, and evidently causing<br />\nthe damage by allowing the trouble to take<br />\nplace. .(2), The Juniors, for holding captive<br />\ncertain Freshmen, a fault which is perhaps<br />\nexcusable, and (3), The Freshman, for making<br />\nan entry by force into a place where they had<br />\nno right to be.<br />\nIt does not seem fair for the Juniors to pay<br />\nfor the damage merely because they had rented<br />\nthe hall; nor is it right for the Freshman to pay<br />\nfor the entire loss, as they acted in a manner<br />\nperfectly natural under the circumstances.<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br /><br />\nThe Seniors, on whom the whole blame might<br />\nbe shifted for the affair having ever taking<br />\nplace at all, would refuse to pay $145 for an<br />\nindiscretion on the part of some of its members.<br />\nUnder these conditions, what is the best<br />\npolicy to adopt? It is very doubtful if any<br />\none of the three classes either would or could<br />\npay the full bill for damages. We suggest<br />\nthat every Undergraduate he called on to pay<br />\nEke amount of one dollar. Owing to the difficulty of collecting this sum from each man,<br />\nand since the breakage is due to the action of<br />\nrepresentatives of all three classes, we suggest<br />\nthat this amount be substracted from each<br />\nman's caUtion money. Those who are opposed<br />\nto this plan may make themselves audible at<br />\nthe next class meeting.<br />\nSurely this is a plan which is, at least,<br />\npractical, and would tend to do away with any<br />\nill-feeling between members of different classes<br />\nin a matter in which it is evident all have<br />\nmade mistakes to a greater or less degree.<br />\nSomeone once said: 'Those who dance should<br />\nplay the fiddler.\" Seniors, Juniors and Freshmen all 'danced\" on the night of the banquet.<br />\nLet everyone, then, join in to pay the fiddler.<br />\nHopkins is too small to have any amount of<br />\nclass squabbles. Let us avoid ill-feeling on<br />\nany subject.<br /><br />\n5<br /><br />\n'02.<br />\nSol Strouse has hung out a doctor's sign<br />\nhere.

Its object is \"to encourage<br />\nsincere and effective public speaking.\" No<br />\nperson is elligable to membership until he has<br />\nactually participated in an intercollegiate contest of debate or of oratory. To quote from<br />\nthe folder: \"Many of the most ambitious,<br />\nenergetic and capable men . . . . in college<br />\ndevote much time to oratory and debate,<br />\nthereby sacrificing frequently an opportunity<br />\nto make football or baseball teams; to make<br />\nPhi Beta Kappa; to win scholarships and other<br />\ncollegiate honors.\" It is to provide a reward<br />\nfor such men that the new society has been<br />\nstarted. The writer of the \"manifesto\" at<br />\nhand is, perhaps, a little to confident in the<br />\nfuture glories of Delta Sigma Rho. Speaking<br />\nof the society he writes: \"Wherever and<br />\nwhenever men are looking for ability and<br />\nleadership, for cultivated minds and strong<br />\nwills, for initiative, energy and integrity,<br />\nhither they will turn first.\" That is pretty<br /><br />\nMR.

For so<br />\nearly in the season both teams played remarkably well.

The Freshmen had been practicing<br />\nfaithfully for two or three weeks and had had<br />\nthe advantage of two practice games. The<br />\nconsequent team work and condition was more<br />\nthan enough to overcome the little superiority<br />\nin individual playing the Juniors might have<br />\nhad.<br />\nGreat credit is due the Freshmen for their<br />\nperformance, and in the same degree should<br />\nthe Juniors feel their defeat. Had they displayed a little, just a little, teamwork to show<br />\nthat they had made some attempt to work for<br />\nthe game the defeat would not be so disgraceful.<br /><br />\nHOPKINS, 6\u2014NAVY, 1.<br />\nThe game with the Navy was decidedly not<br />\nall that one could wish. From a Navy standpoint it was very creditable, but from our<br /><br />\nstandpoint it was not eminently so. Our fellows journeyed to Annapolis with the idea<br />\nthat, as long as it was Navy's first game,<br />\nthere wouldn't be much trouble scoring goals,<br />\nand there would be plently of glory for everyone. This idea, coupled with one or two<br />\nother factors, was instrumental in making the<br />\nloyal Hopkins rooters on the sidelines feel<br />\nanything but satisfied. Our team expected an<br />\neasy game and were fooled, for the way Navy<br />\nstarted off with a rush soon demonstrated the<br />\nfact that they were a bunch of fighters, with<br />\nthe same Navy spirit.<br />\nThe game showed that, while stick-work is<br />\nessential to a good lacrosse team, still a good<br />\nfighting spirit can go a long way toward<br />\nmaking up for defects in stick-handling.<br />\nThese sailors were in the game from start to<br />\nfinish, and completely surprised the fellows<br />\nfrom Baltimore. The goal scored by them<br />\nwas a clean, well-deserved goal, and no fluke.<br />\nTheir anxiety to play hard was, at times,<br />\nworked to disadvantage on their defense, for,<br />\nby their rushing so hard, our attack could<br />\ndodge almost at will. They have been quick<br />\nto learn, and if they only keep it up for a year<br />\nor so, Hopkins will have as hard a time to<br />\ndefeat Navy as they do to lick Swarthmore.<br />\nUnfortunately, the field was rather small,<br /><br />\n416<br /><br />\n10<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br /><br />\nand gave but a poor opportunity for the Hopkins play to show up as it would unquestionably have done on a larger and more level<br />\nfield. The game was played early in the<br />\nafternoon, right after dinner, and those par<br />\nsnip fritters, with which some of our fellows<br />\nregaled themselves, got in their destructive<br />\nwork, as Charlie Mathias 'will testify. AltoIS THE<br />\ngether, the team did not play well, but the<br />\nabsence of Meyer, on the defence, the fact<br />\nthat there had been no line-up for a week, and<br />\nthe knowledge ihat it was Navy's first game,<br />\nall worked together to bring about the result,<br />\nFOR SMOKERS<br />\nfamiliar to everyone.
