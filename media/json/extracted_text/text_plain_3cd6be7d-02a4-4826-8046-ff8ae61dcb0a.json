Welfare<br />\npayment for a family of four<br />\nin this city is two hundred and<br />\nsixty-seven dollars a month.<br />\nAfter you've paid the current<br />\namount of rent hikes--it's going<br />\nto leave you a dollar per day per<br />\nperson for food and nothing<br />\nelse.\"<br />\nDr. Harvey asserted that the<br />\ngreatest positive aspects of the<br />\namendment were that it controls<br />\nrents and keeps them in the<br />\nbounds of fairness, while giving<br />\nthe tenant movement some<br />\npower to counter the landlords.<br />\n<br />\n\"It will give the tenants some<br />\nway of evening out the balance,<br />\nwhich at the moment lies<br />\nentirely with the landlords,\" said<br />\nHarvey.<br />\nDr. Hamilton, representing<br />\nthe anti-rent control side articulated, \"I believe (that) when the<br />\nprice of some object is restricted<br />\nby law, that it has the inevitable<br />\nside effect of restricting the<br />\nquantity that is available. I<br />\nbelieve this is true for housing.<br />\nIn the case of rent control I<br />\nreally do believe what will<br />\nhappen if the rent control issue<br />\npasses is that it will restrict the<br />\nsupply of housing of Baltimore<br />\ncity residents.\"<br />\nAfter the formal debate had<br />\nfinished, the audience asked<br />\nquestions for about forty-five<br />\nminutes. A vote was taken as to<br />\nwhat side of the issue the<br />\nmembers of the audience favored the rent control amendment<br />\nafter listening to the debate.<br />\nThe following evening another debate was held in Remsen<br />\nHall before a much smaller<br />\naudience. The two sides in the<br />\ndebate were represented by the<br />\ntwo groups that have been most<br />\nactive on Question K in Baltimore. Keep Baltimore Best took<br />\nthe position against rent control<br />\nwhile the pro-rent control stand<br />\nwas taken by the Baltimore Rent<br />\nControl Campaign.<br />\nThe Rent Control Campaign, represented by Rich Gatto and Christina Gutierrez, opened the debate with Mr. Gatto<br />\nexplaining the major provisions<br />\nof the proposal. He then went<br />\non to support the amendment.<br />\n\"People are living under a<br />\none percent vacancy rate in<br />\nrental housing. That means that<br />\nif your landlord gives you an<br />\nincrease that you can't afford<br />\nand you look around for someplace to go, you'll have a real<br />\nhard time finding it. Because of<br />\n<br />\nthat there are a number of<br />\nlandlords who take advantage of<br />\nthat situation by price gouging.<br />\nAs a result families are making<br />\nchoices like -do I pay the rent or<br />\npay the heating bill, or do I get<br />\nwhat my kids need for food and<br />\nclothing or can we pay the rent<br />\nthis month?\" stated Mr. Gatto.<br />\nElia Mannetta and Marguerite Campbell, representing Keep<br />\nBaltimore Best, argued that<br />\nthere would be problems with<br />\nenforcing the law if it were<br />\npassed.<br />\nMr. Mannetta used<br />\nexamples of other cities in which<br />\nrent control has failed. \"Boston<br />\nhas rent control. Boston has had<br />\nrent control for ten year. Boston is presently decontrolling...<br />\nNew York is presently decontrolling. The thing of interest in<br />\nall of these cities is that they are<br />\nall ordinances, not city charter<br />\namendments... We are beginning<br />\nto attract private money into<br />\nthis city. Private money right<br />\nnow is waiting to see what<br />\nhappens to Question K.\" Mr.<br />\nMannetta claimed that the situation was similar to wanting to<br />\ncut off the whole arm when only<br />\nthe hand is hurting.<br />\nAlthough there are many<br />\nHopkins students on both sides<br />\nof the rent control issue, accordon<br />\ning to Cliff Salinger,\"<br />\ncampus I've found that most<br />\npeople I've talked to are leaning<br />\ntowards rent control.\"<br />\nSandy Saunders, a senior<br />\nand an apartment dweller commented, \"I believe that rent<br />\ncontrol would be very beneficial to Hopkins students in<br />\ngeneral.<br />\nA large number of<br />\nundergraduates and graduates<br />\nlive in apartments and rent<br />\ncontrol provides the needed<br />\nprotection from money hungry<br />\nlandlords who realize they have<br />\nHopkins students at their mercy<br />\ndue to the lack of adequate<br />\nhousing in the Hopkins area.\"<br />\n<br />\nThey<br />\ncan't come in here.'<br />\nwalked out, and they didn't<br />\nknow what was going on.<br />\nGeorge said,`Close the door.'<br />\nThere was no vote taken.\"<br />\nThe Student Constitution<br />\nrequires a unanimous vote to<br />\nclose a Student Council meeting.<br />\nMessana said, \"He didn't even<br />\ngive us a choice whether we<br />\nwanted a closed meeting or not.<br />\nHe sent the freshmen out like<br />\nlittle kids. I was sitting to his<br />\nright and I said,'George, is this a<br />\nclosed meeting?'<br />\nHe just<br />\nshrugged. I would not have<br />\nvoted for a closed meeting; I<br />\ndidn't think it was necessary7<br />\n\"If we were so self-righteous, shouldn't we have let the<br />\nwhole story come out?\" Messana added,\"All of this has been<br />\nbuilding up in the freshmen's<br />\nguts. Right now they're probably very pissed at us.\"<br />\n\"What gets done are the things<br />\nthat are important to him.<br />\nIt was the same thing last year,\"<br />\nMessana recalled. \"We're going<br />\nto be pushing through certain<br />\nprograms, however they're going<br />\nto be George's programs, they're<br />\nnot going to be the Student<br />\nCouncil's programs.\"<br />\n\"Rape Crisis is a great idea<br />\nand so is Career Advising,<br />\nhowever attendance at these<br />\nthings is terrible,\" Messana said,<br />\n\"He's terrible on publicity. He<br />\nloses money but it doesn't really<br />\nmatter. He's spending money,<br />\nI think, indiscriminately.\"<br />\nConnolly's influence is especially strong in proposing<br />\neducation policy. Connolly is<br />\nthe undergraduate representative<br />\non the Curriculum Review<br />\nCommittee. This year, Dean<br />\nHooker appointed the Student<br />\nCouncil President to a seat on<br />\nthe Committee on Undergraduate Studies which used to be<br />\nfilled by Student Council appointment. Messana criticized<br />\nConnolly's appointment by the<br />\nAdministration,\"He should have<br />\ngone through the Committee on<br />\nCommittees if he wanted to be<br />\non CUS\"<br />\n<br />\nMessana also questioned<br />\nConnolly's relationship with<br />\nRobert Elkin, Chairman of the<br />\nEducation Committee,\"Bob and<br />\nGeorge are good friends and<br />\nwork out a lot of things on the<br />\nside; we never hear about it in<br />\nCouncil, so we don't know what<br />\nthe questions are, so it's hard to<br />\nbreak down his points. I ti ink<br />\n(Elkin) has his arguments with<br />\nGeorge beforehand and by the<br />\ntime we get to a meeting they<br />\nhave a solid front.\"<br />\n\"Centralization of power in<br />\nthe President is not the best way<br />\nto run the Council,\" advised<br />\nMessana, \" I don't relish the<br />\nthought of wasting two hours<br />\nevery Wednesday night listening<br />\nto someone else tell me the way<br />\nthings are going to be run<br />\naround this school.\"<br />\n\"George programs very well,<br />\nand liothing he does wrong ever<br />\ngets out,\" said Messana,\"He has<br />\nto speak for the Council on<br />\noccasion, but when he is in a<br />\nmeeting he is a member among<br />\nequals. He has no more power<br />\nthan anyone else. He presides<br />\nover meetings, which shouldn't<br />\nbe a power, but it is.\" The<br />\nCouncil agreed last week that<br />\nagendas are to be published two<br />\ndays before each meeting so that<br />\nall members have the opportunity to prepare for debate.<br />\nMessana was asked what<br />\nother action might be taken to<br />\ncontrol Connolly. \"I don't<br />\nknow,\" he said, \"Write another<br />\nConstitution limiting his power?<br />\nA strong censure from the<br />\nStudent Council to George?

Question K has stirred up<br />\na lot of dust this month, in addition to polluting the<br />\nairwaves with some of the cornyist political advertising of<br />\nthe decade. Come Tuesday night we won't have to listen<br />\nto \"construction workers\" reading off of tele-prompters<br />\nanymore, but the decision voters reach on Question K<br />\ncould be with us for years to come.<br />\nThe issue is a complicated one, to say the least, but<br />\nseveral facts seem relatively clear to us.<br />\n1) The question of rent control would never have<br />\narisen at all if rents in Baltimore had not skyrocketed at an<br />\nunreasonable rate over the past several years. Since rents<br />\nrarely include oil and gas bills, landlords have no justification for raising rents at or above the yearly inflation rate.<br />\nSpeculators and landlords could have saved themselves all<br />\nthis trouble if they had only curbed their greed instead of<br />\ntheir improvement expenditures.<br />\n2) Question K is not designed to \"get\" landlords.<br />\nThe measure will not set up Revolutionary Renters Councils dealing out death to price gougers. Rather, a commission made up of landlords, tenants, and homeowners will<br />\nbe established to deal fairly with the situation. Rent<br />\nincreases under Question K will be equitable, not arbitrary.<br />\n3) At a University where over 50% of the upperclassmen rent apartments, any student newspaper which<br />\ncomes out against rent control is bound to be very unpopular, and any editor of such a newspaper would be exposed<br />\nto bodily harm.<br />\n4) If the process does indeed turn out to be economically unsound, it is by no means irreversible.<br />\nKeep Baltimore Best and other Question K naysayers have been spouting off a good deal lately about Baltimore's Renaissance. Mobtown, they assure us, is on the<br />\nverge of becoming the garden spot of the Eastern Seaboard, and rent control threatens to smash all Bob Schaeffer's pretty dreams to dust. Vital private capital, they<br />\nclaim, will be scared away from a city so hostile to the<br />\nworkings of a free market. The Inner Harbor is not<br />\nCharles Village, however -- and people do not rent homes<br />\nin the Convention Center. Baltimore is indeed a unique<br />\nplace, but any renaissance which has occured has come<br />\nabout through cooperation, not exploitation. If Baltimore's Golden Age can only be achieved at the expense<br />\nof its poor and powerless --then to hell with it.<br />\nAs long as we're on the subject of city-wide issues,<br />\nwe might as well cover a few more extra-campus concerns.<br />\nThe first doesn't venture very far afield. We're<br />\ntalking about the asphalt deathtrap known as N. Charles<br />\nSt. Every year, the eccentric traffic pattern and confusing<br />\nintersections take their toll in student carnage, and this<br />\none is no exception. Where we come from, a median strip<br />\ndivides the direction of traffic, but the one out in front of<br />\nthe Library seems to be there just for show. Since most<br />\nstudents must cross this obstacle course getting to and<br />\nfrom their homes, it is the University's responsibility<br />\nto pressure the City into some action. Baltimore drivers are<br />\ndeadly enough on safe roads.<br />\nTurning again to politics, rent control is not the<br />\nonly issue to be decided on the 7th. We literary types<br />\ndown here at the itirews-Letter urge all Hopkins students to<br />\nflock to the polls and oust Rhymin' Hyman from the<br />\nCity Comptroller's office. Mobtown's self-proclaimed poet<br />\nlaureate is a hack-writer and a public embarrassment of the<br />\nfirst order.

In<br />\nthe first canoe, the expert at the<br />\nstern does all the work, and the<br />\nboat eventually capsizes. The<br />\nsecond canoe, on the other<br />\nhand, safely completes the run<br />\nbecause both men work together<br />\nto get around the rocks. The<br />\nvoice-over says that the insurance company is like the second<br />\nteam, for the firm and the client<br />\nboth work to cut losses. Active<br />\ncooperation is the ideal relationship for the insurance industry,<br />\nand for any academic advising<br />\nsystem as well.<br />\nAll too often, during my<br />\n_years at Hopkins, the advising<br />\nprocess is trivialized to the point<br />\nwhere the advisor is simply<br />\nsomeone who signed the course<br />\nslip at the end of the semester.<br />\nAn auto-pen mig;it do lust as<br />\nwell.<br />\nSuch a system hurts all<br />\nstudents.

A successful advisor-advisee relationship moreover<br />\nrequires a strong degree of<br />\nmutual trust. Trust takes time io<br />\ndevelop. Just as the student,<br />\nthen, must be assessing his needs<br />\nvirtually every day, the advisor<br />\nmust be available throughout<br />\nevery week of the semester.<br />\nHaving an office hour or two<br />\none or two days a week is hardly<br />\nconducive to build any sort of<br />\nrapport.<br />\nThe following relationship,<br />\nabove all, should not \u2022exist,<br />\nthough it apparently is not that<br />\nuncommon: The novice, wearing<br />\nthe flimsiest of life jackets<br />\nclimbs into the bow.

The upperclassmen presumably have a better idea of<br />\nwhat they want, but still need<br />\nadvice about career opportunities and graduate schools.<br />\nThe need for a reciprocal<br />\nrelationship between the advisor<br />\nand the advisee cannot be<br />\noveremphasized. The advisor<br />\nshould not, of course, paternalistically tell his charge, \"I ant a<br />\nquarter cenmy older than you:<br />\nI know your interests better<br />\nthan you do.- He should however feel free to suggest that a<br />\nstudent take certain courses and<br />\nparticipate in certain outside<br />\nactivities.

Sponsored by the<br />\nStudent Council, the schedule<br />\nalso included presentations by<br />\nDirector of Student Services<br />\nChris Colombo and Director of<br />\nSecurity Major Robert Larkin,<br />\nalong with a short film. About<br />\n20 students attended.<br />\nRobinson is Associate Chief<br />\nof Obstetrics and Gynecology at<br />\nBaltimore City Hospital and<br />\nworks in a clinic for rape and<br />\nsexual abuse patients. He gave<br />\nthe audience an historical background of the treatment of such<br />\nvictims, listed some data, and<br />\nthen disclosed his personal experiences.<br />\n\"Rape has been honored in<br />\nstory and myth, and a bad<br />\ntradition arose,\" Robinson began. Women were not given<br />\ngood care -- unpleasant and<br />\nformal, so-called comforts such<br />\nas policemen and physicians<br />\nwere often of little emotional<br />\nassistance. In 1972, however,<br />\nwith the advent of women's<br />\ngroups, the mayor of Baltimore<br />\nestablished a committee (which<br />\nincluded a JHU faculty member<br />\nsince departed) to study the<br />\nissue. A system whereby 3 area<br />\nhospitals divided Baltimore into<br />\ndistricts resulted in 1974. (Hopkins' district is serviced by<br />\nMercy Hospital). Since that<br />\ntime, Robinson's clinic has seen<br />\nclose to 1,000 patients.<br />\nA variety of statistics followed, some surprising. For<br />\nexample, 30% of the people<br />\nCity Hospital has treated have<br />\nbeen children under 13 years of<br />\nage, a larger percentage than for<br />\nany other age group. Half of<br />\nthese children were assailed by<br />\nacquaintances, while only 15%<br />\nof the victims over 14 knew<br />\ntheir attackers.

They<br />\nbegan when chairpersons of the<br />\nWeekend<br />\nCouncil<br />\nStudent<br />\nWonder Flix and those of the<br />\nChaplain's Office Wonder Flix<br />\ndecided to combine the series. In<br />\nthe past, both groups have<br />\nworked under the title of<br />\nWeekend Wonder Flix, showing<br />\nfilms on alternate weekends and<br />\naccruing their own profits. This<br />\nyear, they decided to combine<br />\nthe two series and split the<br />\nprofits from week to week.<br />\nIn late August Battaglia<br />\npropos-! to<br />\nthis<br />\nbrought<br />\nConnolly and Director of Student Services Chris Columbo.<br />\nConnolly said that when they<br />\nassented, they did not realize<br />\nthat the decision to combine<br />\nwould cause significant problems. Columbo objected that<br />\nhis office should not take<br />\nresponsibility for equipment or<br />\nfacilities that might be damaged<br />\nwhile the Chaplain's Office was<br />\nrunning the film. According to<br />\n<br />\nConnolly, access to funds became difficult because all the<br />\nmoney for both Series was kept<br />\nin the Office of the Chaplain.<br />\nHe asked Battaglia to put S.C.<br />\nprofits in the S.A.C. Office, but<br />\nthat she never did so. \"Since she<br />\nleft, I went to Dr. Wickwire and<br />\nwithin two days the money was<br />\nmoved.\"<br />\nBattaglia said that the money had been put into a University account under the name of<br />\nWeekend Wonder Flix. This had<br />\nall been cleared through Columbo and Wickwire at the beginning of the semester. \"I don't<br />\nknow exactly why George<br />\nConnolly would have gone to<br />\nsuch trouble to alter the system<br />\nthat took so much red tape to<br />\nset up,\" Battaglia said.<br />\nBattaglia and Connolly agreed that the most serious<br />\nproblems resulted from conflicts<br />\nwith members of the Senior<br />\nClass Film Series. Difficulties<br />\nbegan when Weekend Wonder<br />\nFlix scheduled the same Marx<br />\nBrothers festival that the Senior<br />\nClass had already planned to<br />\nshow, and arranged to show<br />\nthe film two weeks before.<br />\n\"This was our screw-up,\"<br />\nBattaglia admitted. \"But the<br />\ndistributor was the same for<br />\nboth films and they also were<br />\nresponsible.\" She added that the<br />\nproblem was resolved by splitting the profits for those two<br />\nweeks between Senior Class Film<br />\nSeries and Weekend Wonder<br />\n<br />\nFlix. \"Wonder Flix knew it<br />\nwould lose money but felt<br />\nto keep things calm it would be<br />\nbetter to just be nice to one<br />\nanother.\"<br />\nAnother problem with the<br />\nSenior Class Film Series involved<br />\nroom scheduling. Although the<br />\nSenior Class made out its schedule first, Wonderflix was the<br />\nfirst to have theirs printed. They<br />\nhad arranged to reserve Shriver<br />\nHall for every weekend except<br />\nwhen the band, Special Events,<br />\nand Shriver Hall Concert Series<br />\nneeded it. On those occasions<br />\nthey would show their films in<br />\nRemsen. Battaglia said that the<br />\nSenior, Class asked frequently in<br />\nthe fall. that it be allowed<br />\nto use Shriver for one or two<br />\nbig-name movies. \"We said no.\"<br />\nShe said that there would be<br />\nproblems because the Weekend<br />\nWonder Flix schedule was already printed up and distributed.<br />\n\"We felt we had been<br />\nbumped to Remsen enough<br />\ntimes,\" said Mollie Marshall.<br />\n\"They only had to go there<br />\nonce.\" According to Kevin<br />\nEmerson, a member of the<br />\nSenior Class Film Series, having<br />\nto go to Remsen should not have<br />\nbecome an issue at all. He said<br />\nthat students are perfectly willing to walk the extra steps from<br />\none building to another, if they<br />\nwant to see a movie. His complaint was that Senior Class<br />\npeople were unable to secure<br />\n<br />\npermission to use Shriver. between the two film series and<br />\nConnolly said that Battaglia had Battaglia did not come.<br />\nBattaglia said that she got in<br />\nagreed verbally during the interview for her position to allow touch with Connolly later the<br />\nthe Senior Class to take Shriver same day. \"It was hardly eight<br />\nhours.

There is no<br />\nguarantee that housing quality will improve.<br />\n\"If the bill is defeated, though, some<br />\nproblems are also raised. Many of the larger<br />\napartment buildings nearby will convert to<br />\ncondominiums. From the standpoint of the<br />\ninvestor, a condominium is more profitable and<br />\nless costly to operate than a rental unit. It is<br />\nalso not suited for student budgets.

About half of the<br />\nindustry figure goes toward paying off a mortgage, which is a fixed rate, often based on the<br />\nlow interest rates of 10 or 15years ago.

Kush and<br />\nothers who run ASU football deny it.<br />\nNow Rutledge is taking Kush, a living legend in<br />\n, to court. Taking a revered figure like<br />\nSouthwest<br />\nthe<br />\nKush, whose coaching skills have made Arizona State<br />\ninto a national football power, to court would be a<br />\nradical act in itself in Arizona. But Rutledge's action, in<br />\nthe words of ASU Athletic Director Fred Miller, presents<br />\na \"danger to the entire coaching profession,\" presumably because it could alter the ill-defined legal relationship between players and coaches. The issue revolves<br />\naround player-coach relationships that sometimes turn as<br />\nviolent as football.<br />\nRutledge's accusations of coach violence are only<br />\nthe most recent public ones. In December, 1978, Ohio<br />\nState coach Woody Hayes punched a Clemson player on<br />\nnational television during the Gator Bowl. Hayes, who<br />\nhad been involved in violent incidents before with<br />\nreporters and his own players, was fired after the Gator<br />\nBowl. Just last month Michigan coach Bo Shembechler<br />\nallegedly shoved a student reporter around the locker<br />\nroom when the student asked about the need to recruit a<br />\nnew kicker for the team.<br />\nNeither the Clemson player nor the student<br />\nreporter took action against the coaches. Until<br />\nRutledge, few have actually filed formal accusations.<br />\nOne reason is that when incidents of coaches<br />\nphysically abusing players do occur, they typically<br />\nhappen on semi-private practice fields, and are generally<br />\naccepted as a regrettable but normal part of a violent<br />\ngame.<br />\nLee Brock, a former University of Washington<br />\nplayer who played under Kush in the 1969 East-West<br />\ngame, says coaches often tell players that if they can't<br />\ntake the pressure, they will probably fail in other facets<br />\n<br />\nof life. Coaches \"use tough techniques for behavior<br />\nmodification, to make (players) mean.\"<br />\nThe extraordinary success of some legendary<br />\n\"tough\" coaches like Vince Lombardi, Paul Brown,and<br />\nKush(whom Brock calls a \"very intense person\")<br />\nmay also help convince players to accept physical abuse<br />\nquietly, though \"tough\" training techniques are not<br />\nnecessarily synonymous with coaches physically abusing<br />\nathletes.<br />\n\u2022 Players who do want to complain about abuse<br />\ndon't have established grievance procedures. NCAA<br />\nattorney Bob Minnix says his organization \u2014 of which<br />\nArizona State is a member --normally can't help a player.<br />\n\"A coach abusing a player on or off the field is not<br />\nwithin our jurisdiction...It's not a violation of our rules.<br />\n<br />\niktJ player and coach wrestle it out in court.<br />\nshould be handeld through the courts or in-house.\"<br />\nIndeed, Rutledge's lawyer, Robert 0. Hing,<br />\nstarted the ASU controversy with a six-page,\"in-house\"<br />\ncomplaint filed with the Arizona Board of Regents early<br />\nthis fall. The complaint said Kush and assistant coach<br />\nWilliam Maskill \"harrassed\" Rutledge into quitting the<br />\nteam, that Kush \"assaulted\" Rutledge during the<br />\nASU-Washington game in Seattle last year, and that both<br />\ncoaches deceived Rutledge concerning \"redshirt\" -or non-playing reserve -- status during that time.<br />\nThe regents rejected the complaint five days<br />\nlater. On Sept. 17, Hing went to Phoenix to file the same<br />\ncharges as part of a $1.1 million civil suit. The suit also<br />\ncharges Kush, assistants Maskill and Gary Horton, and<br />\n<br />\nIt<br />\n<br />\nthe regents with conducting a \"cover-up\" of the alleged<br />\nharrassment campaign.<br />\nA steady stream of \"no comments\" has flowed<br />\nfrom spokesmen for both sides as they scramble for an<br />\nadvantage, though Hing doesn't expect a trial for \"at<br />\nleast a year.\"<br />\nBut in football-mad Tempe, the Conflict has<br />\nalready become a major topic of conversation. The tone<br />\nof the conversation keeps getting hotter, too. The<br />\nRutledge family has endured continuous threats through<br />\nthe mail and over the phone since Hing filed the first<br />\ncomplaint Sept. 3. They've had to get an unlisted home<br />\nnumber, and to put their Phoenix home under 24-hour<br />\nsurveillance.<br />\nThose weren't idle precautions. Several hours<br />\nafter news of the complaint was released on Sept. 5, a<br />\nfire broke out in the insurance office of Gordon<br />\nRutledge, Kevin's father. The fire, which was started in<br />\nthree separate spots in the office, caused $50,000 in<br />\ndamage. Police are investigating arson.<br />\nThree days after the lawsuit was filed, a janitor<br />\nworking for Gordon Rutledge was assaulted and robbed<br />\nin the parking lot outside the fire-damaged office building. The burglar alarm was tripped, but police couldn't<br />\ntell if the building itself was robbed.<br />\nEven attorney Hing says his life has been threatened twice. And Gordon Rutledge now believes two<br />\nmajor daily newspapers are purposefully killing important stories about the case.<br />\nBut the case is getting thicker anyway. The ASU<br />\npublished accounts of a tape recording on<br />\nPress<br />\nState<br />\nwhich some football players claim ASU coaches supplied<br />\nthem with pre-written statements denying they'd seen<br />\nKush strike Rutledge. One player on the tape reportedly<br />\nsaw the incident, but signed the statement because \"my<br />\nfuture, my education depends on this...Kush has so<br />\nmuch pull...There's a lot I have to worry about.\"<br />\nIt's difficult to measure the effect all the controversy is having on Kush, the athletic department, or<br />\nthe team, which is having an uncharacteristically mediocre season thus far. Athletic Director Fred Miller has<br />\ncalled Rutledge's charges \"malicious untruths from a<br />\ndisillusioned student-athlete.\"<br />\n<br />\n11 110,<br />\n11 \u2022<br />\n11 110t1111\u2022\u2022<br />\n11 \u2022<br />\n11 \u2022<br />\n11 \u2022<br />\n11 \u2022<br />\n\u2022\u2022<br />\n1\u202211\u202211\u202211\u202211\u202211\u202211\u202211\u202211\u202211\u202211\u202211\u202211\u202211\u202211\u202211\u202211\u20220\u202211\u202211\u202200ii\u2022ii\u2022H\u202211000\u202211\u202211\u202211\u202211<br />\n<br />\n110110110I100011\u202211\u202211\u202211\u202211\u202211\u202211\u202211\u202211\u202211\u202211\u20221<br />\n01101101101IONONOWNIONONON.11.0.11011611011011\u2022<br />\n<br />\n6<br />\nt<br />\n<br />\n\u2022<br />\n6<br />\naa<br />\na<br />\na<br />\n6<br />\nI:<br />\n<br />\n6<br />\n6<br />\ni<br />\n6<br />\n4<br />\ni<br />\n<br />\n,E_.<br />\n<br />\n,<br />\n6<br />\n6<br />\n6<br />\ni<br />\n4<br />\n4<br />\n6<br />\no<br />\n6<br />\n<br />\n\u2022<br />\n<br />\nYou are cordially invited<br />\nto a special reception for<br />\nJohn Barth<br />\nIn recognition of his newly<br />\npublished novel:<br />\n<br />\na<br />\na<br />\na<br />\n<br />\na,<br />\n,<br />\ni<br />\n<br />\nA<br />\n' ./,..

Currently playing at the<br />\nMechanic Theatre, Da is the dramatization of a family reunion: when Charlie<br />\nTynan returns to his childhood home in<br />\nDublin after his father's death to sort<br />\nthrough family papers, he finds that he<br />\nhas returned to his Dublin childhood as<br />\nwell. Memory materializes, and each time<br />\n<br />\now a<br />\n<br />\nCharlie remembers a past moment or<br />\nperson, the image is projected, in the<br />\nform of an actor or scene, onto the stage.<br />\nCharlie Tynan (Tom Crawley) has<br />\na restless memory, but the source of<br />\nmuch of his disquiet is his equally animated (though deceased) father, played by<br />\nBarnard Hughes, who won a Tony for this<br />\nrole last year. A superb actor, Hughes<br />\nallows the character, Da, to emerge<br />\ngradually. Instead of a facile, noticeably<br />\n\"dramatic\" delivery (which would be a<br />\ntempting approach with this play: it is<br />\n<br />\nA\u2018ratt<br />\nt<br />\nCharlie listens to his Da.<br />\n<br />\n'It<br />\n<br />\n\"If you live, you move,\" says<br />\nArlene Stark of Goucher College, guest<br />\nspeaker at this week's Wednesday Noon<br />\nS<br />\nspeerniets.thS<br />\nStark<br />\ne<br />\nitsalakindga nacbeoutth<br />\nand<br />\nhour<br />\nebrearpistrelatively new field.<br />\nDance therapy starts with the<br />\npremise that body movement is the basic<br />\nmethod of communication. In primitive<br />\ncultures, before the invention of spoken<br />\nlanguage, people used their bodies to<br />\nexpress themselves and to survive. When<br />\nmen began to hunt, they learned to move<br />\nlike hunters. When men wanted rain,<br />\nthey moved like they wanted rain, to<br />\ncommunicate with the rain god.<br />\nMovement expresses feelings. Even in today's society, it is often simpler<br />\nto act out or dance out an emotion than<br />\nto describe it. Stark described how she<br />\nonce had to demonstrate falling in love<br />\nfor an improvisation class and found<br />\ndoing it easier than talking about it. She<br />\nactually discovered that this could be true<br />\nwhen she was first beginning to study<br />\nballet and imagined her mother's head as<br />\nthe target of her giant kicks. She had<br />\nnever before been able to properly<br />\nexpress her -anger towards her mother.<br />\nDance rituals were sometimes<br />\nused in order to assuage fear.

The addition of guitarist Joe<br />\nWalsh to toughen up the group's overall<br />\nsound worked marvelously on the group's<br />\n1976 masterpiece, Hotel California, but<br />\non this new album the Eagles sound tired<br />\nand disinterested.<br />\nThis is quite a shame, for The<br />\nLong Run is one of the most lavishly<br />\nproduced and packaged LPs the world has<br />\nseen. The music is flawlessly performed<br />\nand the production work by Bill Szymcyzk is crystal clear. The album's jacket<br />\ndesign reminds one of the Bible and the<br />\noh-so-fashionable inside group photograph make this the most chic coffee-table album since James Taylor's JT.<br />\nUnfortunately, what counts for most<br />\nrecord buyers is what's in the grooves,<br />\nnot what's protecting them.<br />\nThe compositions on this album<br />\ndisplay a regressive trend away form the<br />\nstartling eloquence the Eagles managed<br />\non Hotel California. And I still fail to<br />\nunderstand why the vocal leadership has<br />\npassed from guitarist Glenn Frey to the<br />\nstrained whine of drummer Don Henley.<br />\nCompare a song like the early hits \"Take<br />\nIt Easy\" or \"Already Gone,\" where Frey<br />\nbelts it out with the best of them, to the<br />\nplodding title track of The Long Run.<br />\nThe new song sounds tired and generally<br />\n\"blah,\" and Henley's vocals don't save<br />\nthe song as Frey used to be able to do.<br />\nNew bassist Timothy B. Schmit,<br />\nformer lead singer of the recently successful Poco, contribures a song,\"I Can't Tell<br />\nYou Why,\" that, however pretty, succeeds more at showing off Schmit's<br />\nhigh-range vocal limitations than anything<br />\n<br />\nelse. One redeeming virtue, however, is<br />\nthe beautiful background supplied by the<br />\nunamed string synthesizer player.<br />\n- Next is Joe Walsh's \"In the City,\"<br />\na song that originally appeared on the<br />\nsoundtrack for the movie The Warriors.<br />\nDespite Walsh's admirable slide guitar<br />\nplaying, the song cannot hide the fact<br />\nthat Walsh's voice is a truly pathetic<br />\nwhine. It also seems surprising that,<br />\nconsidering how lont it has taken the<br />\nEagles to produce this album, they would<br />\nre-release a song that received a considerable amount of airplay over the summer.<br />\n\"The Disco Strangler\" starts off<br />\nwith a strangely engaging guitar riff, but<br />\nthe song soon becomes as monotonous as<br />\nthose that it is parodying. It is fairly<br />\nobvious from the earnestness with which<br />\nHenley sings this that this monotony was<br />\nnot intentional. The song falls into a<br />\ngroove and stays there; there is no climax<br />\nand buildup to end the song, it merely<br />\nends.<br />\n\"King of Hollywood\" is an<br />\nexploration of the seamier side of Hollywood life; it's a slow, plodding song that<br />\nattempts to build a mysterious air and<br />\nfails. Henley and Frey share lead vocals as<br />\n<br />\nthe synthesizer solo by Frey, however,<br />\nthe group suddenly awakens and finishes<br />\nthe album on a definite upswing. Don<br />\nFelde contributes a brilliant guitar solo to<br />\nend \"Teenage Jail,\" and this segues<br />\ndirectly into \"The Greeks Don't Want No<br />\nFreaks,\" the fastest song on the album<br />\nand one that reminds me of the earlier<br />\ndays of the group.<br />\nThe final song,\"The Sad Cafe,\" is<br />\nthe only slow song on the album that<br />\ntruly works. Henley, for once, contributes a fine lead vocal without a trace of<br />\nthe irritating strain it shows elsewhere. In<br />\naddition to this fine vocal performance,<br />\nDon Felder contributes a beautiful<br />\nacoustic guitar solo, and guest saxophonist David Sanborn introduces an interesting twist to the song's final coda.<br />\nIt seems to me ,that if the Eagles<br />\nreally want to make Don Henley their full<br />\ntime lead vocalist, they should go out and<br />\nfind a capable drummer who is able to<br />\nconform to the new writing style of the<br />\ngroup. Henley plods along on slow<br />\nmaterial; yes, he was fine on \"Life in the<br />\nFast Lane\" and \"Already Gone\", but the<br />\nEagles aren't doing this type of material<br />\nanymore.<br />\nAll in all, this seems a generally<br />\nuninspired work which took the Eagles<br />\nan inordinately long time to finish.<br />\nDespite the album's upbeat finish, the<br />\ngeneral monotony and boredom conveyed by the Eagles performance pervades<br />\nthe material as well. That's a shame. The<br />\npotential was there for making The Long<br />\nRun a really sizzling follow-up to Hotel<br />\nCalifornia; unfortunately, the Eagles<br />\ndon't sound very interested in doing so.<br />\n<br />\nthough they were singing \"Mary Had A<br />\nLittle Lamb;\" all the more a shame<br />\nbecause this song could have been quite<br />\ninteresting indeed if the singers had<br />\nsounded interested.<br />\nSide two fares quite a bit better<br />\nby comparison. It starts off with \"Heartache Tonight,\" the current single, the<br />\nbest song on the album and, not incidentally, the only song on which Frey sings<br />\nlead vocal. Walsh contributes a great,<br />\nboozy slide guitar solo and the group<br />\nseems<br />\nto<br />\nspring<br />\nto<br />\nlife.<br />\n\"Those Shoes,\" by comparison, is quite a<br />\ncomedown. Using the talk-box guitars he<br />\npioneered with Peter Frampton, Walsh<br />\nproduces an utterly directionless solo that<br />\ndoes nothing to endear one to the song.<br />\nHenley, when he should be sounding<br />\nrelaxed and loose, sings it like a funeral<br />\ndirge, a manner wholly incongruous with<br />\nthe bixarre lyrics.<br />\n\"Teenage Jail\" sounds more like<br />\nsomething I would expect from Iggy<br />\nPop rather than the Eagles. Despite the<br />\ninteresting starts and stops, the Eagles'<br />\nrhythm section proves incapable of<br />\nsustaining a very slow tempo, as it is<br />\nrequired to do in this song.

This was the first<br />\nyear the women had team status.<br />\nAs a club last year, they missed<br />\nthe Middle Atlantic Conference<br />\nChampionship by a mere point.<br />\nAlso, the team was without<br />\nEleanor<br />\nstandout<br />\nrunner<br />\nSimonsick, who had a field<br />\nhockey game on the day of the<br />\ntournament. Lastly,the team<br />\novercame their fiercest opponent: their own nerves.<br />\nIn taking the crown Hopkins led the field with 39 points<br />\nfollowed by the host school,<br />\nFranklin and Marshall, with 50<br />\npoints.

The<br />\nother Jay entered in the race was<br />\nJill Huppert with a solid<br />\n22:28.2,,the best race of her<br />\ncareer.<br />\nThe course was flat and fast.<br />\nCoach Gary Green did an<br />\noutstanding job preparing the<br />\nteam for the specific conditions.<br />\nFor two weeks prior to the<br />\nmeet, the team spent a great deal<br />\nof time on the track running<br />\nintervals. The speedwork paid<br />\noff, as the course was by far the<br />\nfastest that the girls encountered<br />\nover the season. Good cool<br />\nrunning weather greeted the<br />\nparticipants.<br />\nBefore the Hopkins triumph<br />\nthe team was \"wired and nerv-<br />\n<br />\nous,\" confided Coach Green.<br />\n\"But they are clutch performers<br />\n.who seem to run their best when<br />\ntheir backs are against the wall,\"<br />\nGreen continued. Every one<br />\nof the girls ran their personal<br />\nbests for the season at the meet.<br />\nWhile nobody said anything on<br />\nthe trip up to F&M, the ride<br />\nhome featured plenty of singing<br />\nand rejoicing. 'The team's team<br />\nsong is \"Heartache Tonight\" by<br />\nthe Eagles, but the title sure as<br />\nhell was appropriate for the ride<br />\nhome.<br />\nThe MAC's was by no<br />\nmeans the endpoint of the<br />\nsquad's journey.

He told the Council<br />\nabout problems such as lack of<br />\ncooperation with members of<br />\nthe Senior Class Film Series,<br />\nconflicting scheduling of movies<br />\nand missing meetings.

On October 30 in<br />\nLevering Hall before an audience<br />\nof over one hundred, the Student Council, the New Political<br />\nCaucus, and the Office of the<br />\nChaplain sponsored a debate<br />\nbetween Dr. Bruce Hamilton of<br />\nthe Political Economy Department and Dr. David Harvey of<br />\nthe Geography and Environmental Engineering Department.<br />\nDr. Harvey, who took the<br />\npro-rent control stance argued,<br />\n\"The median income of tenants<br />\nin this city has been falling<br />\nrelative to inflation while the<br />\nmedian income of landlords has<br />\nbeen keeping pace perfectly<br />\nwell. About twenty percent of<br />\nthe households in the tenant<br />\nsector are on welfare. Welfare<br />\npayment for a family of four<br />\nin this city is two hundred and<br />\nsixty-seven dollars a month.<br />\nAfter you've paid the current<br />\namount of rent hikes--it's going<br />\nto leave you a dollar per day per<br />\nperson for food and nothing<br />\nelse.\"<br />\nDr. Harvey asserted that the<br />\ngreatest positive aspects of the<br />\namendment were that it controls<br />\nrents and keeps them in the<br />\nbounds of fairness, while giving<br />\nthe tenant movement some<br />\npower to counter the landlords.<br /><br />\n\"It will give the tenants some<br />\nway of evening out the balance,<br />\nwhich at the moment lies<br />\nentirely with the landlords,\" said<br />\nHarvey.<br />\nDr. Hamilton, representing<br />\nthe anti-rent control side articulated, \"I believe (that) when the<br />\nprice of some object is restricted<br />\nby law, that it has the inevitable<br />\nside effect of restricting the<br />\nquantity that is available. I<br />\nbelieve this is true for housing.<br />\nIn the case of rent control I<br />\nreally do believe what will<br />\nhappen if the rent control issue<br />\npasses is that it will restrict the<br />\nsupply of housing of Baltimore<br />\ncity residents.\"<br />\nAfter the formal debate had<br />\nfinished, the audience asked<br />\nquestions for about forty-five<br />\nminutes. A vote was taken as to<br />\nwhat side of the issue the<br />\nmembers of the audience favored the rent control amendment<br />\nafter listening to the debate.<br />\nThe following evening another debate was held in Remsen<br />\nHall before a much smaller<br />\naudience. The two sides in the<br />\ndebate were represented by the<br />\ntwo groups that have been most<br />\nactive on Question K in Baltimore. Keep Baltimore Best took<br />\nthe position against rent control<br />\nwhile the pro-rent control stand<br />\nwas taken by the Baltimore Rent<br />\nControl Campaign.<br />\nThe Rent Control Campaign, represented by Rich Gatto and Christina Gutierrez, opened the debate with Mr. Gatto<br />\nexplaining the major provisions<br />\nof the proposal. He then went<br />\non to support the amendment.<br />\n\"People are living under a<br />\none percent vacancy rate in<br />\nrental housing. That means that<br />\nif your landlord gives you an<br />\nincrease that you can't afford<br />\nand you look around for someplace to go, you'll have a real<br />\nhard time finding it. Because of<br /><br />\nthat there are a number of<br />\nlandlords who take advantage of<br />\nthat situation by price gouging.<br />\nAs a result families are making<br />\nchoices like -do I pay the rent or<br />\npay the heating bill, or do I get<br />\nwhat my kids need for food and<br />\nclothing or can we pay the rent<br />\nthis month?\" stated Mr. Gatto.<br />\nElia Mannetta and Marguerite Campbell, representing Keep<br />\nBaltimore Best, argued that<br />\nthere would be problems with<br />\nenforcing the law if it were<br />\npassed.<br />\nMr. Mannetta used<br />\nexamples of other cities in which<br />\nrent control has failed. \"Boston<br />\nhas rent control. Boston has had<br />\nrent control for ten year. Boston is presently decontrolling...<br />\nNew York is presently decontrolling. The thing of interest in<br />\nall of these cities is that they are<br />\nall ordinances, not city charter<br />\namendments... We are beginning<br />\nto attract private money into<br />\nthis city. Private money right<br />\nnow is waiting to see what<br />\nhappens to Question K.\" Mr.<br />\nMannetta claimed that the situation was similar to wanting to<br />\ncut off the whole arm when only<br />\nthe hand is hurting.<br />\nAlthough there are many<br />\nHopkins students on both sides<br />\nof the rent control issue, accordon<br />\ning to Cliff Salinger,\"<br />\ncampus I've found that most<br />\npeople I've talked to are leaning<br />\ntowards rent control.\"<br />\nSandy Saunders, a senior<br />\nand an apartment dweller commented, \"I believe that rent<br />\ncontrol would be very beneficial to Hopkins students in<br />\ngeneral.<br />\nA large number of<br />\nundergraduates and graduates<br />\nlive in apartments and rent<br />\ncontrol provides the needed<br />\nprotection from money hungry<br />\nlandlords who realize they have<br />\nHopkins students at their mercy<br />\ndue to the lack of adequate<br />\nhousing in the Hopkins area.\"<br /><br />\nThey<br />\ncan't come in here.'<br />\nwalked out, and they didn't<br />\nknow what was going on.<br />\nGeorge said,`Close the door.'<br />\nThere was no vote taken.\"<br />\nThe Student Constitution<br />\nrequires a unanimous vote to<br />\nclose a Student Council meeting.<br />\nMessana said, \"He didn't even<br />\ngive us a choice whether we<br />\nwanted a closed meeting or not.<br />\nHe sent the freshmen out like<br />\nlittle kids. I was sitting to his<br />\nright and I said,'George, is this a<br />\nclosed meeting?'<br />\nHe just<br />\nshrugged. I would not have<br />\nvoted for a closed meeting; I<br />\ndidn't think it was necessary7<br />\n\"If we were so self-righteous, shouldn't we have let the<br />\nwhole story come out?\" Messana added,\"All of this has been<br />\nbuilding up in the freshmen's<br />\nguts. Right now they're probably very pissed at us.\"<br />\n\"What gets done are the things<br />\nthat are important to him.<br />\nIt was the same thing last year,\"<br />\nMessana recalled. \"We're going<br />\nto be pushing through certain<br />\nprograms, however they're going<br />\nto be George's programs, they're<br />\nnot going to be the Student<br />\nCouncil's programs.\"<br />\n\"Rape Crisis is a great idea<br />\nand so is Career Advising,<br />\nhowever attendance at these<br />\nthings is terrible,\" Messana said,<br />\n\"He's terrible on publicity. He<br />\nloses money but it doesn't really<br />\nmatter. He's spending money,<br />\nI think, indiscriminately.\"<br />\nConnolly's influence is especially strong in proposing<br />\neducation policy. Connolly is<br />\nthe undergraduate representative<br />\non the Curriculum Review<br />\nCommittee. This year, Dean<br />\nHooker appointed the Student<br />\nCouncil President to a seat on<br />\nthe Committee on Undergraduate Studies which used to be<br />\nfilled by Student Council appointment. Messana criticized<br />\nConnolly's appointment by the<br />\nAdministration,\"He should have<br />\ngone through the Committee on<br />\nCommittees if he wanted to be<br />\non CUS\"<br /><br />\nMessana also questioned<br />\nConnolly's relationship with<br />\nRobert Elkin, Chairman of the<br />\nEducation Committee,\"Bob and<br />\nGeorge are good friends and<br />\nwork out a lot of things on the<br />\nside; we never hear about it in<br />\nCouncil, so we don't know what<br />\nthe questions are, so it's hard to<br />\nbreak down his points. I ti ink<br />\n(Elkin) has his arguments with<br />\nGeorge beforehand and by the<br />\ntime we get to a meeting they<br />\nhave a solid front.\"<br />\n\"Centralization of power in<br />\nthe President is not the best way<br />\nto run the Council,\" advised<br />\nMessana, \" I don't relish the<br />\nthought of wasting two hours<br />\nevery Wednesday night listening<br />\nto someone else tell me the way<br />\nthings are going to be run<br />\naround this school.\"<br />\n\"George programs very well,<br />\nand liothing he does wrong ever<br />\ngets out,\" said Messana,\"He has<br />\nto speak for the Council on<br />\noccasion, but when he is in a<br />\nmeeting he is a member among<br />\nequals. He has no more power<br />\nthan anyone else. He presides<br />\nover meetings, which shouldn't<br />\nbe a power, but it is.\" The<br />\nCouncil agreed last week that<br />\nagendas are to be published two<br />\ndays before each meeting so that<br />\nall members have the opportunity to prepare for debate.<br />\nMessana was asked what<br />\nother action might be taken to<br />\ncontrol Connolly. \"I don't<br />\nknow,\" he said, \"Write another<br />\nConstitution limiting his power?<br />\nA strong censure from the<br />\nStudent Council to George?

Question K has stirred up<br />\na lot of dust this month, in addition to polluting the<br />\nairwaves with some of the cornyist political advertising of<br />\nthe decade. Come Tuesday night we won't have to listen<br />\nto \"construction workers\" reading off of tele-prompters<br />\nanymore, but the decision voters reach on Question K<br />\ncould be with us for years to come.<br />\nThe issue is a complicated one, to say the least, but<br />\nseveral facts seem relatively clear to us.<br />\n1) The question of rent control would never have<br />\narisen at all if rents in Baltimore had not skyrocketed at an<br />\nunreasonable rate over the past several years. Since rents<br />\nrarely include oil and gas bills, landlords have no justification for raising rents at or above the yearly inflation rate.<br />\nSpeculators and landlords could have saved themselves all<br />\nthis trouble if they had only curbed their greed instead of<br />\ntheir improvement expenditures.<br />\n2) Question K is not designed to \"get\" landlords.<br />\nThe measure will not set up Revolutionary Renters Councils dealing out death to price gougers. Rather, a commission made up of landlords, tenants, and homeowners will<br />\nbe established to deal fairly with the situation. Rent<br />\nincreases under Question K will be equitable, not arbitrary.<br />\n3) At a University where over 50% of the upperclassmen rent apartments, any student newspaper which<br />\ncomes out against rent control is bound to be very unpopular, and any editor of such a newspaper would be exposed<br />\nto bodily harm.<br />\n4) If the process does indeed turn out to be economically unsound, it is by no means irreversible.<br />\nKeep Baltimore Best and other Question K naysayers have been spouting off a good deal lately about Baltimore's Renaissance. Mobtown, they assure us, is on the<br />\nverge of becoming the garden spot of the Eastern Seaboard, and rent control threatens to smash all Bob Schaeffer's pretty dreams to dust. Vital private capital, they<br />\nclaim, will be scared away from a city so hostile to the<br />\nworkings of a free market. The Inner Harbor is not<br />\nCharles Village, however -- and people do not rent homes<br />\nin the Convention Center. Baltimore is indeed a unique<br />\nplace, but any renaissance which has occured has come<br />\nabout through cooperation, not exploitation. If Baltimore's Golden Age can only be achieved at the expense<br />\nof its poor and powerless --then to hell with it.<br />\nAs long as we're on the subject of city-wide issues,<br />\nwe might as well cover a few more extra-campus concerns.<br />\nThe first doesn't venture very far afield. We're<br />\ntalking about the asphalt deathtrap known as N. Charles<br />\nSt. Every year, the eccentric traffic pattern and confusing<br />\nintersections take their toll in student carnage, and this<br />\none is no exception. Where we come from, a median strip<br />\ndivides the direction of traffic, but the one out in front of<br />\nthe Library seems to be there just for show. Since most<br />\nstudents must cross this obstacle course getting to and<br />\nfrom their homes, it is the University's responsibility<br />\nto pressure the City into some action. Baltimore drivers are<br />\ndeadly enough on safe roads.<br />\nTurning again to politics, rent control is not the<br />\nonly issue to be decided on the 7th. We literary types<br />\ndown here at the itirews-Letter urge all Hopkins students to<br />\nflock to the polls and oust Rhymin' Hyman from the<br />\nCity Comptroller's office. Mobtown's self-proclaimed poet<br />\nlaureate is a hack-writer and a public embarrassment of the<br />\nfirst order.

In<br />\nthe first canoe, the expert at the<br />\nstern does all the work, and the<br />\nboat eventually capsizes. The<br />\nsecond canoe, on the other<br />\nhand, safely completes the run<br />\nbecause both men work together<br />\nto get around the rocks. The<br />\nvoice-over says that the insurance company is like the second<br />\nteam, for the firm and the client<br />\nboth work to cut losses. Active<br />\ncooperation is the ideal relationship for the insurance industry,<br />\nand for any academic advising<br />\nsystem as well.<br />\nAll too often, during my<br />\n_years at Hopkins, the advising<br />\nprocess is trivialized to the point<br />\nwhere the advisor is simply<br />\nsomeone who signed the course<br />\nslip at the end of the semester.<br />\nAn auto-pen mig;it do lust as<br />\nwell.<br />\nSuch a system hurts all<br />\nstudents.

A successful advisor-advisee relationship moreover<br />\nrequires a strong degree of<br />\nmutual trust. Trust takes time io<br />\ndevelop. Just as the student,<br />\nthen, must be assessing his needs<br />\nvirtually every day, the advisor<br />\nmust be available throughout<br />\nevery week of the semester.<br />\nHaving an office hour or two<br />\none or two days a week is hardly<br />\nconducive to build any sort of<br />\nrapport.<br />\nThe following relationship,<br />\nabove all, should not \u2022exist,<br />\nthough it apparently is not that<br />\nuncommon: The novice, wearing<br />\nthe flimsiest of life jackets<br />\nclimbs into the bow.

The upperclassmen presumably have a better idea of<br />\nwhat they want, but still need<br />\nadvice about career opportunities and graduate schools.<br />\nThe need for a reciprocal<br />\nrelationship between the advisor<br />\nand the advisee cannot be<br />\noveremphasized. The advisor<br />\nshould not, of course, paternalistically tell his charge, \"I ant a<br />\nquarter cenmy older than you:<br />\nI know your interests better<br />\nthan you do.- He should however feel free to suggest that a<br />\nstudent take certain courses and<br />\nparticipate in certain outside<br />\nactivities.

Sponsored by the<br />\nStudent Council, the schedule<br />\nalso included presentations by<br />\nDirector of Student Services<br />\nChris Colombo and Director of<br />\nSecurity Major Robert Larkin,<br />\nalong with a short film. About<br />\n20 students attended.<br />\nRobinson is Associate Chief<br />\nof Obstetrics and Gynecology at<br />\nBaltimore City Hospital and<br />\nworks in a clinic for rape and<br />\nsexual abuse patients. He gave<br />\nthe audience an historical background of the treatment of such<br />\nvictims, listed some data, and<br />\nthen disclosed his personal experiences.<br />\n\"Rape has been honored in<br />\nstory and myth, and a bad<br />\ntradition arose,\" Robinson began. Women were not given<br />\ngood care -- unpleasant and<br />\nformal, so-called comforts such<br />\nas policemen and physicians<br />\nwere often of little emotional<br />\nassistance. In 1972, however,<br />\nwith the advent of women's<br />\ngroups, the mayor of Baltimore<br />\nestablished a committee (which<br />\nincluded a JHU faculty member<br />\nsince departed) to study the<br />\nissue. A system whereby 3 area<br />\nhospitals divided Baltimore into<br />\ndistricts resulted in 1974. (Hopkins' district is serviced by<br />\nMercy Hospital). Since that<br />\ntime, Robinson's clinic has seen<br />\nclose to 1,000 patients.<br />\nA variety of statistics followed, some surprising. For<br />\nexample, 30% of the people<br />\nCity Hospital has treated have<br />\nbeen children under 13 years of<br />\nage, a larger percentage than for<br />\nany other age group. Half of<br />\nthese children were assailed by<br />\nacquaintances, while only 15%<br />\nof the victims over 14 knew<br />\ntheir attackers.

They<br />\nbegan when chairpersons of the<br />\nWeekend<br />\nCouncil<br />\nStudent<br />\nWonder Flix and those of the<br />\nChaplain's Office Wonder Flix<br />\ndecided to combine the series. In<br />\nthe past, both groups have<br />\nworked under the title of<br />\nWeekend Wonder Flix, showing<br />\nfilms on alternate weekends and<br />\naccruing their own profits. This<br />\nyear, they decided to combine<br />\nthe two series and split the<br />\nprofits from week to week.<br />\nIn late August Battaglia<br />\npropos-! to<br />\nthis<br />\nbrought<br />\nConnolly and Director of Student Services Chris Columbo.<br />\nConnolly said that when they<br />\nassented, they did not realize<br />\nthat the decision to combine<br />\nwould cause significant problems. Columbo objected that<br />\nhis office should not take<br />\nresponsibility for equipment or<br />\nfacilities that might be damaged<br />\nwhile the Chaplain's Office was<br />\nrunning the film. According to<br /><br />\nConnolly, access to funds became difficult because all the<br />\nmoney for both Series was kept<br />\nin the Office of the Chaplain.<br />\nHe asked Battaglia to put S.C.<br />\nprofits in the S.A.C. Office, but<br />\nthat she never did so. \"Since she<br />\nleft, I went to Dr. Wickwire and<br />\nwithin two days the money was<br />\nmoved.\"<br />\nBattaglia said that the money had been put into a University account under the name of<br />\nWeekend Wonder Flix. This had<br />\nall been cleared through Columbo and Wickwire at the beginning of the semester. \"I don't<br />\nknow exactly why George<br />\nConnolly would have gone to<br />\nsuch trouble to alter the system<br />\nthat took so much red tape to<br />\nset up,\" Battaglia said.<br />\nBattaglia and Connolly agreed that the most serious<br />\nproblems resulted from conflicts<br />\nwith members of the Senior<br />\nClass Film Series. Difficulties<br />\nbegan when Weekend Wonder<br />\nFlix scheduled the same Marx<br />\nBrothers festival that the Senior<br />\nClass had already planned to<br />\nshow, and arranged to show<br />\nthe film two weeks before.<br />\n\"This was our screw-up,\"<br />\nBattaglia admitted. \"But the<br />\ndistributor was the same for<br />\nboth films and they also were<br />\nresponsible.\" She added that the<br />\nproblem was resolved by splitting the profits for those two<br />\nweeks between Senior Class Film<br />\nSeries and Weekend Wonder<br /><br />\nFlix. \"Wonder Flix knew it<br />\nwould lose money but felt<br />\nto keep things calm it would be<br />\nbetter to just be nice to one<br />\nanother.\"<br />\nAnother problem with the<br />\nSenior Class Film Series involved<br />\nroom scheduling. Although the<br />\nSenior Class made out its schedule first, Wonderflix was the<br />\nfirst to have theirs printed. They<br />\nhad arranged to reserve Shriver<br />\nHall for every weekend except<br />\nwhen the band, Special Events,<br />\nand Shriver Hall Concert Series<br />\nneeded it. On those occasions<br />\nthey would show their films in<br />\nRemsen. Battaglia said that the<br />\nSenior, Class asked frequently in<br />\nthe fall. that it be allowed<br />\nto use Shriver for one or two<br />\nbig-name movies. \"We said no.\"<br />\nShe said that there would be<br />\nproblems because the Weekend<br />\nWonder Flix schedule was already printed up and distributed.<br />\n\"We felt we had been<br />\nbumped to Remsen enough<br />\ntimes,\" said Mollie Marshall.<br />\n\"They only had to go there<br />\nonce.\" According to Kevin<br />\nEmerson, a member of the<br />\nSenior Class Film Series, having<br />\nto go to Remsen should not have<br />\nbecome an issue at all. He said<br />\nthat students are perfectly willing to walk the extra steps from<br />\none building to another, if they<br />\nwant to see a movie. His complaint was that Senior Class<br />\npeople were unable to secure<br /><br />\npermission to use Shriver. between the two film series and<br />\nConnolly said that Battaglia had Battaglia did not come.<br />\nBattaglia said that she got in<br />\nagreed verbally during the interview for her position to allow touch with Connolly later the<br />\nthe Senior Class to take Shriver same day. \"It was hardly eight<br />\nhours.

Many of the larger<br />\napartment buildings nearby will convert to<br />\ncondominiums. From the standpoint of the<br />\ninvestor, a condominium is more profitable and<br />\nless costly to operate than a rental unit. It is<br />\nalso not suited for student budgets.

About half of the<br />\nindustry figure goes toward paying off a mortgage, which is a fixed rate, often based on the<br />\nlow interest rates of 10 or 15years ago.

Kush and<br />\nothers who run ASU football deny it.<br />\nNow Rutledge is taking Kush, a living legend in<br />\n, to court. Taking a revered figure like<br />\nSouthwest<br />\nthe<br />\nKush, whose coaching skills have made Arizona State<br />\ninto a national football power, to court would be a<br />\nradical act in itself in Arizona. But Rutledge's action, in<br />\nthe words of ASU Athletic Director Fred Miller, presents<br />\na \"danger to the entire coaching profession,\" presumably because it could alter the ill-defined legal relationship between players and coaches. The issue revolves<br />\naround player-coach relationships that sometimes turn as<br />\nviolent as football.<br />\nRutledge's accusations of coach violence are only<br />\nthe most recent public ones. In December, 1978, Ohio<br />\nState coach Woody Hayes punched a Clemson player on<br />\nnational television during the Gator Bowl. Hayes, who<br />\nhad been involved in violent incidents before with<br />\nreporters and his own players, was fired after the Gator<br />\nBowl. Just last month Michigan coach Bo Shembechler<br />\nallegedly shoved a student reporter around the locker<br />\nroom when the student asked about the need to recruit a<br />\nnew kicker for the team.<br />\nNeither the Clemson player nor the student<br />\nreporter took action against the coaches. Until<br />\nRutledge, few have actually filed formal accusations.<br />\nOne reason is that when incidents of coaches<br />\nphysically abusing players do occur, they typically<br />\nhappen on semi-private practice fields, and are generally<br />\naccepted as a regrettable but normal part of a violent<br />\ngame.<br />\nLee Brock, a former University of Washington<br />\nplayer who played under Kush in the 1969 East-West<br />\ngame, says coaches often tell players that if they can't<br />\ntake the pressure, they will probably fail in other facets<br /><br />\nof life. Coaches \"use tough techniques for behavior<br />\nmodification, to make (players) mean.\"<br />\nThe extraordinary success of some legendary<br />\n\"tough\" coaches like Vince Lombardi, Paul Brown,and<br />\nKush(whom Brock calls a \"very intense person\")<br />\nmay also help convince players to accept physical abuse<br />\nquietly, though \"tough\" training techniques are not<br />\nnecessarily synonymous with coaches physically abusing<br />\nathletes.<br />\n\u2022 Players who do want to complain about abuse<br />\ndon't have established grievance procedures. NCAA<br />\nattorney Bob Minnix says his organization \u2014 of which<br />\nArizona State is a member --normally can't help a player.<br />\n\"A coach abusing a player on or off the field is not<br />\nwithin our jurisdiction...It's not a violation of our rules.<br /><br />\niktJ player and coach wrestle it out in court.<br />\nshould be handeld through the courts or in-house.\"<br />\nIndeed, Rutledge's lawyer, Robert 0. Hing,<br />\nstarted the ASU controversy with a six-page,\"in-house\"<br />\ncomplaint filed with the Arizona Board of Regents early<br />\nthis fall. The complaint said Kush and assistant coach<br />\nWilliam Maskill \"harrassed\" Rutledge into quitting the<br />\nteam, that Kush \"assaulted\" Rutledge during the<br />\nASU-Washington game in Seattle last year, and that both<br />\ncoaches deceived Rutledge concerning \"redshirt\" -or non-playing reserve -- status during that time.<br />\nThe regents rejected the complaint five days<br />\nlater. On Sept. 17, Hing went to Phoenix to file the same<br />\ncharges as part of a $1.1 million civil suit. The suit also<br />\ncharges Kush, assistants Maskill and Gary Horton, and<br /><br />\nIt<br /><br />\nthe regents with conducting a \"cover-up\" of the alleged<br />\nharrassment campaign.<br />\nA steady stream of \"no comments\" has flowed<br />\nfrom spokesmen for both sides as they scramble for an<br />\nadvantage, though Hing doesn't expect a trial for \"at<br />\nleast a year.\"<br />\nBut in football-mad Tempe, the Conflict has<br />\nalready become a major topic of conversation. The tone<br />\nof the conversation keeps getting hotter, too. The<br />\nRutledge family has endured continuous threats through<br />\nthe mail and over the phone since Hing filed the first<br />\ncomplaint Sept. 3. They've had to get an unlisted home<br />\nnumber, and to put their Phoenix home under 24-hour<br />\nsurveillance.<br />\nThose weren't idle precautions. Several hours<br />\nafter news of the complaint was released on Sept. 5, a<br />\nfire broke out in the insurance office of Gordon<br />\nRutledge, Kevin's father. The fire, which was started in<br />\nthree separate spots in the office, caused $50,000 in<br />\ndamage. Police are investigating arson.<br />\nThree days after the lawsuit was filed, a janitor<br />\nworking for Gordon Rutledge was assaulted and robbed<br />\nin the parking lot outside the fire-damaged office building. The burglar alarm was tripped, but police couldn't<br />\ntell if the building itself was robbed.<br />\nEven attorney Hing says his life has been threatened twice. And Gordon Rutledge now believes two<br />\nmajor daily newspapers are purposefully killing important stories about the case.<br />\nBut the case is getting thicker anyway. The ASU<br />\npublished accounts of a tape recording on<br />\nPress<br />\nState<br />\nwhich some football players claim ASU coaches supplied<br />\nthem with pre-written statements denying they'd seen<br />\nKush strike Rutledge. One player on the tape reportedly<br />\nsaw the incident, but signed the statement because \"my<br />\nfuture, my education depends on this...Kush has so<br />\nmuch pull...There's a lot I have to worry about.\"<br />\nIt's difficult to measure the effect all the controversy is having on Kush, the athletic department, or<br />\nthe team, which is having an uncharacteristically mediocre season thus far. Athletic Director Fred Miller has<br />\ncalled Rutledge's charges \"malicious untruths from a<br />\ndisillusioned student-athlete.\"<br /><br />\n11 110,<br />\n11 \u2022<br />\n11 110t1111\u2022\u2022<br />\n11 \u2022<br />\n11 \u2022<br />\n11 \u2022<br />\n11 \u2022<br />\n\u2022\u2022<br />\n1\u202211\u202211\u202211\u202211\u202211\u202211\u202211\u202211\u202211\u202211\u202211\u202211\u202211\u202211\u202211\u202211\u20220\u202211\u202211\u202200ii\u2022ii\u2022H\u202211000\u202211\u202211\u202211\u202211<br /><br />\n110110110I100011\u202211\u202211\u202211\u202211\u202211\u202211\u202211\u202211\u202211\u202211\u20221<br />\n01101101101IONONOWNIONONON.11.0.11011611011011\u2022<br /><br />\n6<br />\nt<br /><br />\n\u2022<br />\n6<br />\naa<br />\na<br />\na<br />\n6<br />\nI:<br /><br />\n6<br />\n6<br />\ni<br />\n6<br />\n4<br />\ni<br /><br />\n,E_.<br /><br />\n,<br />\n6<br />\n6<br />\n6<br />\ni<br />\n4<br />\n4<br />\n6<br />\no<br />\n6<br /><br />\n\u2022<br /><br />\nYou are cordially invited<br />\nto a special reception for<br />\nJohn Barth<br />\nIn recognition of his newly<br />\npublished novel:<br /><br />\na<br />\na<br />\na<br /><br />\na,<br />\n,<br />\ni<br /><br />\nA<br />\n' ./,..

Currently playing at the<br />\nMechanic Theatre, Da is the dramatization of a family reunion: when Charlie<br />\nTynan returns to his childhood home in<br />\nDublin after his father's death to sort<br />\nthrough family papers, he finds that he<br />\nhas returned to his Dublin childhood as<br />\nwell. Memory materializes, and each time<br /><br />\now a<br /><br />\nCharlie remembers a past moment or<br />\nperson, the image is projected, in the<br />\nform of an actor or scene, onto the stage.<br />\nCharlie Tynan (Tom Crawley) has<br />\na restless memory, but the source of<br />\nmuch of his disquiet is his equally animated (though deceased) father, played by<br />\nBarnard Hughes, who won a Tony for this<br />\nrole last year. A superb actor, Hughes<br />\nallows the character, Da, to emerge<br />\ngradually. Instead of a facile, noticeably<br />\n\"dramatic\" delivery (which would be a<br />\ntempting approach with this play: it is<br /><br />\nA\u2018ratt<br />\nt<br />\nCharlie listens to his Da.<br /><br />\n'It<br /><br />\n\"If you live, you move,\" says<br />\nArlene Stark of Goucher College, guest<br />\nspeaker at this week's Wednesday Noon<br />\nS<br />\nspeerniets.thS<br />\nStark<br />\ne<br />\nitsalakindga nacbeoutth<br />\nand<br />\nhour<br />\nebrearpistrelatively new field.<br />\nDance therapy starts with the<br />\npremise that body movement is the basic<br />\nmethod of communication. In primitive<br />\ncultures, before the invention of spoken<br />\nlanguage, people used their bodies to<br />\nexpress themselves and to survive.

Even in today's society, it is often simpler<br />\nto act out or dance out an emotion than<br />\nto describe it.

She<br />\nactually discovered that this could be true<br />\nwhen she was first beginning to study<br />\nballet and imagined her mother's head as<br />\nthe target of her giant kicks.

The addition of guitarist Joe<br />\nWalsh to toughen up the group's overall<br />\nsound worked marvelously on the group's<br />\n1976 masterpiece, Hotel California, but<br />\non this new album the Eagles sound tired<br />\nand disinterested.<br />\nThis is quite a shame, for The<br />\nLong Run is one of the most lavishly<br />\nproduced and packaged LPs the world has<br />\nseen. The music is flawlessly performed<br />\nand the production work by Bill Szymcyzk is crystal clear. The album's jacket<br />\ndesign reminds one of the Bible and the<br />\noh-so-fashionable inside group photograph make this the most chic coffee-table album since James Taylor's JT.<br />\nUnfortunately, what counts for most<br />\nrecord buyers is what's in the grooves,<br />\nnot what's protecting them.<br />\nThe compositions on this album<br />\ndisplay a regressive trend away form the<br />\nstartling eloquence the Eagles managed<br />\non Hotel California. And I still fail to<br />\nunderstand why the vocal leadership has<br />\npassed from guitarist Glenn Frey to the<br />\nstrained whine of drummer Don Henley.<br />\nCompare a song like the early hits \"Take<br />\nIt Easy\" or \"Already Gone,\" where Frey<br />\nbelts it out with the best of them, to the<br />\nplodding title track of The Long Run.<br />\nThe new song sounds tired and generally<br />\n\"blah,\" and Henley's vocals don't save<br />\nthe song as Frey used to be able to do.<br />\nNew bassist Timothy B. Schmit,<br />\nformer lead singer of the recently successful Poco, contribures a song,\"I Can't Tell<br />\nYou Why,\" that, however pretty, succeeds more at showing off Schmit's<br />\nhigh-range vocal limitations than anything<br /><br />\nelse. One redeeming virtue, however, is<br />\nthe beautiful background supplied by the<br />\nunamed string synthesizer player.<br />\n- Next is Joe Walsh's \"In the City,\"<br />\na song that originally appeared on the<br />\nsoundtrack for the movie The Warriors.<br />\nDespite Walsh's admirable slide guitar<br />\nplaying, the song cannot hide the fact<br />\nthat Walsh's voice is a truly pathetic<br />\nwhine. It also seems surprising that,<br />\nconsidering how lont it has taken the<br />\nEagles to produce this album, they would<br />\nre-release a song that received a considerable amount of airplay over the summer.<br />\n\"The Disco Strangler\" starts off<br />\nwith a strangely engaging guitar riff, but<br />\nthe song soon becomes as monotonous as<br />\nthose that it is parodying. It is fairly<br />\nobvious from the earnestness with which<br />\nHenley sings this that this monotony was<br />\nnot intentional. The song falls into a<br />\ngroove and stays there; there is no climax<br />\nand buildup to end the song, it merely<br />\nends.<br />\n\"King of Hollywood\" is an<br />\nexploration of the seamier side of Hollywood life; it's a slow, plodding song that<br />\nattempts to build a mysterious air and<br />\nfails. Henley and Frey share lead vocals as<br /><br />\nthe synthesizer solo by Frey, however,<br />\nthe group suddenly awakens and finishes<br />\nthe album on a definite upswing. Don<br />\nFelde contributes a brilliant guitar solo to<br />\nend \"Teenage Jail,\" and this segues<br />\ndirectly into \"The Greeks Don't Want No<br />\nFreaks,\" the fastest song on the album<br />\nand one that reminds me of the earlier<br />\ndays of the group.<br />\nThe final song,\"The Sad Cafe,\" is<br />\nthe only slow song on the album that<br />\ntruly works. Henley, for once, contributes a fine lead vocal without a trace of<br />\nthe irritating strain it shows elsewhere. In<br />\naddition to this fine vocal performance,<br />\nDon Felder contributes a beautiful<br />\nacoustic guitar solo, and guest saxophonist David Sanborn introduces an interesting twist to the song's final coda.<br />\nIt seems to me ,that if the Eagles<br />\nreally want to make Don Henley their full<br />\ntime lead vocalist, they should go out and<br />\nfind a capable drummer who is able to<br />\nconform to the new writing style of the<br />\ngroup. Henley plods along on slow<br />\nmaterial; yes, he was fine on \"Life in the<br />\nFast Lane\" and \"Already Gone\", but the<br />\nEagles aren't doing this type of material<br />\nanymore.<br />\nAll in all, this seems a generally<br />\nuninspired work which took the Eagles<br />\nan inordinately long time to finish.<br />\nDespite the album's upbeat finish, the<br />\ngeneral monotony and boredom conveyed by the Eagles performance pervades<br />\nthe material as well. That's a shame.

Every one<br />\nof the girls ran their personal<br />\nbests for the season at the meet.<br />\nWhile nobody said anything on<br />\nthe trip up to F&amp;M, the ride<br />\nhome featured plenty of singing<br />\nand rejoicing.
