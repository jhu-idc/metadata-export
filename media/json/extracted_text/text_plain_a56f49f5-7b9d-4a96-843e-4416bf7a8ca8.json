The<br />\nvictory of the visitors is all the more<br />\ncreditable for them, as they played<br />\nwithout Bob Hall, their captain, and<br />\nseveral other of their regular players.<br />\nThe maroon and white players ran<br />\nrings 'round the Hopkins veterans,but<br />\nthey have not had the experience of<br />\nthe alumni and did not know the fine<br />\npoints of the game as well. If Hopkins had made its shots for goal in<br />\nthe same ratio as the Swarthmore<br />\nplayers, the alumni would have won.<br />\nas they had at least twice as many<br />\nchances to shoot. Most of the shots<br />\nwent wide of the goal, and so it was<br />\nnot because Atkinson played a better game before the net for Swarthmore than \"Bock\" Blanck did for<br />\nHopkins that the game was lost.<br />\nAll the players on the Swarthmore<br />\nteam were fast. They went after tne<br />\nball with a rush that usually enabled<br />\nthem to get it. The winners' system<br />\nof play was different from the Hopkins system. They would carry the<br />\nball into the vicinity of the Hopkins<br />\ngoal, and then pass it about until<br />\nthey had an extra man before attempting to shoot. The local players<br />\nwould carry the ball down the field,<br />\nand by some quick dodging or passing would try to get an opportunity<br />\nto shoot.<br />\nCaptain Roberts' place was ably<br />\nfilled by White. White played like<br />\na veteran, and his stick-work was not<br />\nsurpassed by any player on either<br />\nteam. Collins led in shooting goals<br />\nand made three of the six Swarthmore tallies.<br />\nThe alumni, with one or two exceptions, played a very good game.<br />\nIf they had only had Henry Frank<br />\nplaying On the close attack, they probably would have won. Alan Dill, the<br />\n'05 'varsity captain, showed up very<br />\nwell. This is the first time he has<br />\nplayed ths season, and while his work<br />\nwas very good he appeared, nevertheless, to be taking things easy. Dr.<br />\nAbercrombie was in fine form.

Manuscript should be endorsed with the writer's name, which<br />\nhowever will not be used unless the<br />\nManuscript is signed. The Alumni<br />\nespecially are urged to make use of<br />\nthis column.)<br />\nTo the Editor of The News-Letter.<br />\nDear Sir:<br />\n\u2022 Apropos the ending of the lacrosse<br />\nseason, I am venturing to suggest<br />\nthat another year the scheme of the<br />\nInter-Lacrosse League be abandoned,<br />\nand the former system of interclass<br />\nteams be reverted to. Any one wno<br />\nhas watched the progress of the<br />\nleague can plainly see, that while it<br />\nhas perhaps increased the interest in<br />\nlacrosse at Mt. Washington and the<br />\nCity College, there has not been much<br />\ninterest in it at Hopkins. In fact, I<br />\nbelieve, one or two games were forfeited by Hopkins because not enough<br />\nmen showed up to make up the team.<br />\nCompare this with the rivalry that<br />\nexisted last year between the sophomore and freshman class teams. Every one was trying for the class<br />\nteams; men worked hard to make the<br />\nteams and practiced regularly. In<br />\nfact, each team had four or five substitutes. It was a question of class<br />\nrivalry; the sophomores were not going to be downed by the freshmen;<br />\nand the freshmen were eager to defeat the sophomores. But what do<br />\nmen at Hopkins care about the City<br />\nCollege or the Mt. Washington<br />\njuniors. Very little in comparison<br />\nwith the feeling, rivalry, and spirit<br />\nthat exists between classes. Everyone knows that the Varsity team this<br />\nyear consisted mainly of men who<br />\ngained their experience on the class<br />\nteams. Could the nucleus of a 'varsity team come from the team that<br />\nrepresented Hopkins in the lacrosse<br />\nleague this year?<br />\nTherefore if the object of the 1903<br />\nteam, in offering the prizes, was to<br />\nstimulate, encourage, and develop lacrosse at Hopkins, it might seem advisable that the old scheme of interclass lacrosse games be revived.<br />\nA Student.<br />\n(Continued from page I, col. i.)<br />\nabout two minutes of play.

It is often<br />\nasked whether these courses must be<br />\ntaken in any fixed order. While not<br />\nimperative, it is none the less desirable to pursue them in the order in<br />\nwhich they are numbered. For the<br />\ncoming year the courses numbered<br />\n5 and 6 will be given by Mr. Myers,<br />\nin place of Prof. Browne. This is the<br />\nfirst time in some years that the Anglo-Saxon course (English Literature<br />\n6) has been offered to undergraduates; but it is intended to make it<br />\nhereafter a course especially for seniors, although open to members of<br />\nother classes.<br />\nThe importance of the courses in<br />\nEnglish Composition deserves emphasis. The department is directing<br />\nespecial efforts to this work, to prevent the graduation of men who are<br />\nilliterate in the sense that they cannot write and speak good English.<br />\nMany who possess the degree of A.<br />\nB. are incapable of writing a creditable letter; this is not the case with<br />\nHopkins graduates, however, and every effort is being put forth to continue and improve the past record.<br />\nThe impression that there is a certain<br />\ndiscredit attached to membership in<br />\nEnglish Composition ra is entirely<br />\nwrong. This course should be regarded as an opportunity and not as<br />\na penalty. For men who desire to secure still more training in composition, the higher courses offer additional opportunities. The course in<br />\ndescription and narration is of a<br />\nsomewhat literary character, and appeals to the exceptional student. The<br />\ntraining in exposition and argument,<br />\non the other hand, is in most cases<br />\nmore useful, and is of value in later<br />\nlife to men in scientific work as well<br />\nas in other fields.

The<br />\nvictory of the visitors is all the more<br />\ncreditable for them, as they played<br />\nwithout Bob Hall, their captain, and<br />\nseveral other of their regular players.<br />\nThe maroon and white players ran<br />\nrings 'round the Hopkins veterans,but<br />\nthey have not had the experience of<br />\nthe alumni and did not know the fine<br />\npoints of the game as well. If Hopkins had made its shots for goal in<br />\nthe same ratio as the Swarthmore<br />\nplayers, the alumni would have won.<br />\nas they had at least twice as many<br />\nchances to shoot. Most of the shots<br />\nwent wide of the goal, and so it was<br />\nnot because Atkinson played a better game before the net for Swarthmore than \"Bock\" Blanck did for<br />\nHopkins that the game was lost.<br />\nAll the players on the Swarthmore<br />\nteam were fast. They went after tne<br />\nball with a rush that usually enabled<br />\nthem to get it. The winners' system<br />\nof play was different from the Hopkins system. They would carry the<br />\nball into the vicinity of the Hopkins<br />\ngoal, and then pass it about until<br />\nthey had an extra man before attempting to shoot. The local players<br />\nwould carry the ball down the field,<br />\nand by some quick dodging or passing would try to get an opportunity<br />\nto shoot.<br />\nCaptain Roberts' place was ably<br />\nfilled by White. White played like<br />\na veteran, and his stick-work was not<br />\nsurpassed by any player on either<br />\nteam. Collins led in shooting goals<br />\nand made three of the six Swarthmore tallies.<br />\nThe alumni, with one or two exceptions, played a very good game.<br />\nIf they had only had Henry Frank<br />\nplaying On the close attack, they probably would have won. Alan Dill, the<br />\n'05 'varsity captain, showed up very<br />\nwell. This is the first time he has<br />\nplayed ths season, and while his work<br />\nwas very good he appeared, nevertheless, to be taking things easy. Dr.<br />\nAbercrombie was in fine form.

Manuscript should be endorsed with the writer's name, which<br />\nhowever will not be used unless the<br />\nManuscript is signed. The Alumni<br />\nespecially are urged to make use of<br />\nthis column.)<br />\nTo the Editor of The News-Letter.<br />\nDear Sir:<br />\n\u2022 Apropos the ending of the lacrosse<br />\nseason, I am venturing to suggest<br />\nthat another year the scheme of the<br />\nInter-Lacrosse League be abandoned,<br />\nand the former system of interclass<br />\nteams be reverted to. Any one wno<br />\nhas watched the progress of the<br />\nleague can plainly see, that while it<br />\nhas perhaps increased the interest in<br />\nlacrosse at Mt. Washington and the<br />\nCity College, there has not been much<br />\ninterest in it at Hopkins. In fact, I<br />\nbelieve, one or two games were forfeited by Hopkins because not enough<br />\nmen showed up to make up the team.<br />\nCompare this with the rivalry that<br />\nexisted last year between the sophomore and freshman class teams. Every one was trying for the class<br />\nteams; men worked hard to make the<br />\nteams and practiced regularly. In<br />\nfact, each team had four or five substitutes. It was a question of class<br />\nrivalry; the sophomores were not going to be downed by the freshmen;<br />\nand the freshmen were eager to defeat the sophomores. But what do<br />\nmen at Hopkins care about the City<br />\nCollege or the Mt. Washington<br />\njuniors. Very little in comparison<br />\nwith the feeling, rivalry, and spirit<br />\nthat exists between classes. Everyone knows that the Varsity team this<br />\nyear consisted mainly of men who<br />\ngained their experience on the class<br />\nteams. Could the nucleus of a 'varsity team come from the team that<br />\nrepresented Hopkins in the lacrosse<br />\nleague this year?<br />\nTherefore if the object of the 1903<br />\nteam, in offering the prizes, was to<br />\nstimulate, encourage, and develop lacrosse at Hopkins, it might seem advisable that the old scheme of interclass lacrosse games be revived.<br />\nA Student.<br />\n(Continued from page I, col. i.)<br />\nabout two minutes of play.

It is often<br />\nasked whether these courses must be<br />\ntaken in any fixed order. While not<br />\nimperative, it is none the less desirable to pursue them in the order in<br />\nwhich they are numbered. For the<br />\ncoming year the courses numbered<br />\n5 and 6 will be given by Mr. Myers,<br />\nin place of Prof. Browne. This is the<br />\nfirst time in some years that the Anglo-Saxon course (English Literature<br />\n6) has been offered to undergraduates; but it is intended to make it<br />\nhereafter a course especially for seniors, although open to members of<br />\nother classes.<br />\nThe importance of the courses in<br />\nEnglish Composition deserves emphasis. The department is directing<br />\nespecial efforts to this work, to prevent the graduation of men who are<br />\nilliterate in the sense that they cannot write and speak good English.<br />\nMany who possess the degree of A.<br />\nB. are incapable of writing a creditable letter; this is not the case with<br />\nHopkins graduates, however, and every effort is being put forth to continue and improve the past record.<br />\nThe impression that there is a certain<br />\ndiscredit attached to membership in<br />\nEnglish Composition ra is entirely<br />\nwrong. This course should be regarded as an opportunity and not as<br />\na penalty. For men who desire to secure still more training in composition, the higher courses offer additional opportunities. The course in<br />\ndescription and narration is of a<br />\nsomewhat literary character, and appeals to the exceptional student. The<br />\ntraining in exposition and argument,<br />\non the other hand, is in most cases<br />\nmore useful, and is of value in later<br />\nlife to men in scientific work as well<br />\nas in other fields.
