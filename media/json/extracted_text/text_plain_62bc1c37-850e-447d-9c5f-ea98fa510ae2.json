He<br />\nencouraged Hopkins and other<br />\nmajor universities to continue that<br />\ntrend.<br />\nGates devoted most of his time,<br />\nhowever, to discussing the \"issue<br />\nof color\" as it related to the black<br />\nidentity and the black self. Gates<br />\nquestioned why so much emphasis was placed on determining<br />\nwhat name it is that blacks actually go by.<br />\nHe spoke of his childhood<br />\nstruggle to legitimize the term<br />\n'black': \"Once inside, we would<br />\n<br />\nproject freedom outside of<br />\nourselves.\" In reality, according<br />\nto Gates, that never proved to be<br />\nthe case.<br />\nBefore the period of racial integration, Gates said, it was<br />\nbelieved to be in the black community that \"if we could only use<br />\nthe legislature and the judiciary<br />\nto create and interpret the law of<br />\nthe desegregation and access, all<br />\nelse would follow. As it turns out,<br />\nit was vastly easier to dismantle<br />\nthe petty forms of American apartheid. . . then anyone would have<br />\npossibly believed it would be.\"<br />\nYet, according to Gates, \"the<br />\neconomic structures in this coun-<br />\n<br />\nBSN<br />\nSTUDENTS.<br />\n<br />\nIN<br />\n<br />\nEnter the Air Force<br />\nimmediately after graduation \u2014 without waiting for the<br />\nresults of your State Boards.

It seems that this label would<br />\nbe more \"at home\" in a statement like, 'The University<br />\ndoes not discriminate against Blacks, Women, Jews,<br />\n<br />\nHomosexuals, or Mexicans.' Such a statement is on the<br />\nsurface non-discriminatory, but is clearly offensive,<br />\ndiscriminatory, and oppressive.\"<br />\nThis may at first glance seem a relatively minor point,<br />\nbut it is an important distinction. The term that applications and all University documents should use is \"sexual<br />\norientation,\" rather than specifying homosexuality. It is<br />\nvital that the misleading term contained within the University's statement of non-discrimination be corrected immediately, especially if the University is sincere in its expressed desire to attract a diverse staff, faculty, and student body.<br />\n<br />\nThe will is not the deed (but it may be a committee)<br />\nAs the semester draws to a close, it's time for one and<br />\nall to take a moment to reflect upon exactly what Student<br />\nCouncil accomplished during the past four months. Council<br />\nfinally decided upon dates for Spring Fair after lengthy<br />\ndebates and attempts to relocate the MCATS. Discussions<br />\nwith security helped result in the installation of lights in<br />\nthe Lower Quad.<br />\nA survey conducted by the Communication Committee,<br />\nwhich attempted to assess student concerns about the Book<br />\nCenter, showed that over 80 percent of those polled supported the idea of a book swap. There is no question that<br />\nan alternative to the buy-back policy held by Barnes and<br />\nNoble has been needed for some time, and the proposed<br />\nStudent Council Books-swap is an excellent solution. To<br />\nquote Margaret Thatcher, however, the will is not the deed.<br />\nOne rather exciting potential change, as the result of<br />\nCouncil efforts, could be some improvements in the Book<br />\nCenter services at Homewood. As with anything connected<br />\nwith Barnes and Noble and Seiler's, the most rational thing<br />\nto do is adopt a we'll-believe-it-when-we-see-it attitude.<br />\nYet when the buying rush begins next semester students<br />\nwill enjoy increased security measures such as functional<br />\nlockers (a truly revolutionary concept) and bag-checkers.<br />\nSo it seems the Student Council Representatives to the<br />\nBook Center Committee have managed to initiate sane<br />\n.improvements in the way Barnes and Noble serves the<br />\nUniversity. The News-Letter hopes that Council and its<br />\nmany committees will continue their work towards<br />\n<br />\ncultivating a positive atmosphere here at the happy<br />\nHomewood homefront.<br />\n<br />\nTime for a new station<br />\nFor the first time in several years, a credible proposal<br />\nfor the return of a student run radio station has been put<br />\nforward. The transformation, in 1985, of the previously<br />\nstudent-run WJHU into a professional radio station was<br />\na regretable decision on the administration's part in the<br />\nfirst place. Although the decision to take WJHU out of<br />\nstudent hands was apparently influenced by administrative<br />\nconcern about a perceived lack of adequate student cornmittment to the station, this should not be held against current efforts at radio revival.<br />\nUniversity support for the proposed radio station would<br />\nbe an acknowledgement of extensive undergraduate efforts<br />\nto overcome a reputation for apathy, and a very positive<br />\nindicator that undergraduate needs and interests have<br />\nbecome a genuine administrative concern.<br />\nThis year's attempt to revive student radio at Hopkins<br />\nappears to be particularly well-conceived and sincerely intended. Whichever of the multiple suggestions for broadcast mediums are chosen, whether on FM or through the<br />\nUniversity's electrical system, we strongly recommend<br />\nconcrete steps towards the speedy renewal of student-run<br />\nradio at Hopkins.<br />\nHappy holidays, people. We'll see you in January.<br />\n<br />\nby Christopher T. McColl Letters<br />\nThe punchline is this: this is on- ly, with my knuckles on one hand<br />\nly part one.<br />\nI've recently had my faith in<br />\nhumankind renewed.

He comes from a<br />\ncattle-ranching family, so he<br />\nowes a lot to the existence of<br />\ncows. But I hate cows. There is<br />\nabsolutely nothing good about<br />\nthem. They exist so people can<br />\nhave steak and hamburgers, and<br />\nso people like James Garner can<br />\nearn money advertising beef on<br />\nTV. We don't need beef to survive. They are a luxury form of<br />\nagriculture. If we were to put all<br />\nthe resources that go into cattle<br />\nfarming into other uses, it would<br />\nbe surprising what gains could be<br />\nmade toward ending world<br />\nhunger, saving the water supplies<br />\nof the arid regions of the U.S.,<br />\nreducing degradation of public<br />\nland, saving the rain forests in<br />\nBrazil. and even reducing the<br />\nthreat of global warming. Unfortuoltely,<br />\n, I don't have the<br />\nnui,)')ers on hand to back up all<br />\nthesc itatements, but I know they<br />\nexist. 'just don't have the time<br />\nto look 'hem up right now. I can<br />\nsay that it takes an incredible<br />\n<br />\namount of grain and water to keep<br />\na cow running. If all the grain used in cattle feed lots was used for<br />\nfeeding people instead, we could<br />\nmake a significant dent in reducing the number of starving people in the world. Raising cows is<br />\na very inefficient use of grain<br />\nsupplies when one considers the<br />\nper pound nutrition received from<br />\nthe beef. It is a serious waste of<br />\nwater as well. One estimate is that<br />\nit takes 2500 gallons of water to<br />\nproduce a one-pound steak. Since<br />\nmuch cattle farming occurs in<br />\nareas with continuously dropping<br />\nwater tables, this is a rather<br />\nsobering fact to consider. Then<br />\nthere are the rain forests. Why<br />\ndoes much of the forest clearing<br />\noccur? So people can graze cows<br />\non the land. Where does much of<br />\nthe beef go? The U.S. Let's look<br />\nat the global warming issue.<br />\nSome say that in order to save<br />\nthe planet, humanity must first<br />\nhave a true appreciation of this<br />\nplace. We must change our<br />\nlifestyles a bit so that we are no<br />\nlonger decoupled from our environment; stop spending every<br />\nday inside cars, buildings and<br />\ncities. We need to \"get back to<br />\nnature\" by taking walks through<br />\nthe woods, watching wild<br />\nanimals, looking at the clouds,<br />\nlearning to appreciate our natural<br />\nsurroundings. But trying to appreciate nature by looking at<br />\ncows in a field or buying a painting with happy cows is a<br />\nmisguided step in this direction.<br />\nI've noticed that cows have<br />\nrecently become an increasingly<br />\n<br />\ncommon pop culture item . . .<br />\nyou see them on mugs, T-shirts,<br />\nTV commercials, etc. This is<br />\ndisturNing, for we would all be<br />\nbetter off if played a much reduced role in our lives.<br />\nWhen one looks at list of sources<br />\nof greenhouse gases (CO2<br />\nmethane, CFC's, etc.) one of the<br />\nsources is \"agriculture.\" One<br />\nusually thinks of agriculture as<br />\ngrowing crops. But plants absorb<br />\nCO2, so how can this be? The<br />\nmajor contribution from<br />\nagriculture is methane. And the<br />\nmethane comes from bovine<br />\nflatulents, also known as cow<br />\nfarts. Cows produce a<br />\nphenomenal amount of methane<br />\nduring normal digestion.<br />\nThe one remaining factor that<br />\nneeds to be addressed is that of<br />\nsaving the public land. Unknown<br />\nto me until last year was the fact<br />\nthat much national forest land is<br />\nleased out to cattle ranchers so<br />\ntheir cattle can graze freely.<br />\nThere are guidelines in place that<br />\nregulate how much grazing can<br />\noccur in a given area. and I like<br />\nto think they are adhered to. But<br />\nconsidering how the Forest Service is managing some of the<br />\nforests in the Pacific Northwest<br />\nand Alaska these days, I have to<br />\nwonder. Regardless of how well<br />\nthe grazing guidelines are<br />\nobeyed, the mere presence of<br />\ncows in national forests is a<br />\nnegative. For wild animals, the<br />\ncows represent competition for<br />\nfood and a source of pollution for<br />\ntheir water supplies.

The<br />\nconcept of going up to 10,000<br />\nfeet above the ground in an aircraft only to be hurled back down<br />\nto Earth may seem foolish to<br />\nmost, but skydiving continues to<br />\ngain popularity among those for<br />\nwhom the heart is bigger than the<br />\nhead.<br />\nDespite many advances in safety achieved during the last few<br />\ndecades, skydiving remains a<br />\n<br />\nsport of very great risk.

There is no<br />\nfeeling like getting onto a wing<br />\nat 10,000 feet. That's the real<br />\n<br />\nhistory (chances of this happening are about 1 in 100,000).<br />\nThat danger, the realization<br />\nthat you are suspended above<br />\nearth and moving toward it at<br />\nover 100 m.p.h., is exactly what<br />\n<br />\nfright.

It's late afternoon and you've spent a whole<br />\nday in ground training and signing all sorts of forms saying that<br />\nif you become pavement pizza,<br />\nyou won't sue anybody. After<br />\nabout 5000 feet, its hard to tell<br />\nyour aircraft is still climbing,<br />\nbecause things on he ground are<br />\ntoo small now to tell. At your<br />\n10,000 feet exit point, you are<br />\nhigh up\u2014very high up.<br />\nThe jumpmaster opens the<br />\nplane's door. This is where most<br />\npeople really begin to get nervous. With the door open and the<br />\nwind howling through, your aircraft isn't the sealed womb that<br />\nit used to be. Now it's just an<br />\nopen platform at 10,000 feet.<br />\nNow it really hits you. Until you<br />\nactually do it, skydiving is a bit<br />\nunimaginable. But now you feel<br />\nit in your gut. You're really going to jump out of this plane. You<br />\nare so high up that if you look<br />\nstraight at the horizon, you can<br />\nsee the curvature of the Earth.<br />\nNow you've done it. With your<br />\ntwo instructors holding you,<br />\nyou've climbed your way out on<br />\nthe wing strut. A synchronized<br />\ncount and . . . you let go of the<br />\nwing.

You must decide<br />\nright away. Is the chute OK? Did<br />\nit deploy properly? If it malfunctions, you must jettison it immediately and pull your secondary, for you're still falling at 120<br />\nmph!<br />\nAhh. It's perfect (almost<br />\nalways is). Now,just detach your<br />\nsteering toggles and locate your<br />\nlanding zone. You feel safe now.<br />\nThat big, beautiful chute keeps<br />\nyou perfectly suspended and<br />\nstable. And, oh yes, its very easily steerable. These square-shaped<br />\nchutes are really just giant wings,<br />\nand a steady pull on the left toggle quickly brings you into a left<br />\nturn.

The themes are cliched and universal, but the play works because it uses specificity<br />\nand anecdote to its advantage.<br />\nThe setting is Greenwich Village: the living<br />\nroom of struggling roommates Jerry (Robert Bell)<br />\nand Ginny (Pamela Becker). Jerry has just received his umpteenth rejection for an acting job, and<br />\neven the slightest transgression is enough to set<br />\nhim off.<br />\nHe isn't huffing and puffing alone for long,<br />\nhowever. Old friend Steve (Josh Mcllvain) arrives, gorilla mask draped over his head, for a protracted argument with Jerry over turkey noodle<br />\nsoup. \"What are you doing,\" Jerry asks, \"rehearsing a monologue?\" Exasperated by Steve's correct assessment of his histrionics, Jerry accuses<br />\nSteve of having a bad case of drug-induced<br />\n\"silliness.\"<br />\nSoon Ginny arrives home; an airhead on a mission from God. She spends her opening moments<br />\non stage cleaning up the apartment, offering empty<br />\ngeneralities to Jerry and Steve like an impatient<br />\nkindergarten teacher. She's not listening\u2014she's<br />\nstraightening. Becker really chews up the role, all<br />\nhands and hair, especially later in the play when<br />\nshe puts on her bell-bottom jeans. The vintage<br />\ncostume seems to invigorate her.<br />\nSteve, Jerry, and Ginny are planning to attend<br />\ntheir high school reunion that night, along with<br />\n<br />\nThere's much to be said for Seattle's Soundgarden, first that many people have been waiting<br />\nfor years to see what would happen when this<br />\npotential Next Big Thing got a shot at major-label<br />\nglory. \"Louder Than Love,\" the band's entry into<br />\nthe big leagues, offers plenty of interesting<br />\npossibilities. Soundgarden's celebration/parody of<br />\nraw phallic power and bare-chested maleness is<br />\nwithout doubt more engaging (and direct) than the<br />\nrituals of teenage petting and drunkenness supervised by the competition.<br />\nAlthough that alone is refreshing, it proves no<br />\nless contrived or silly after the initial fascination<br />\nwears off. Soundgarden undresses the rock cliche,<br />\nlies it down, revels in it, and leaves it apparently<br />\ndespoiled and discredited. In fact, though, the band<br />\nusually just leaves it lying, which accounts for<br />\nmuch of the record's appeal.<br />\nMusically, \"Louder Than Love\" is a rocket<br />\nride, a nail-biting trip that alternates graceful,<br />\nsmooth coasting with a turbulent, disturbing grinding. But Soundgarden, appropriately, is more<br />\nlikely to make hips swing than to elicit raised-fist<br />\nsalutes. The band's sound pays off most handsomely when it shocks or surprises\u2014although your<br />\ncup is sure to overflow once or twice in the course<br />\nof this 50-minute romp, several of the cuts bust<br />\nout too late or from too little.<br />\nThe bottom line (for those who need one):<br />\n\"Louder Than Love\" is far more provocative than<br />\nmost of the boom-boom floating around and glutting the pipes these days. It doesn't smother all<br />\nof its lumps in makeup; instead, it paves right over<br />\nthem. At the same time, \"Louder Than Love\"<br />\nis totally ridiculous and pretentious, and I wish<br />\nSoundgarden would put its collective tongue back<br />\nin its own cheek.<br />\n\u2014Terry Swords<br />\nPoi Dog Pondering\u2014Poi Dog Pondering(Texas<br />\nHotel/Columbia)<br />\n<br />\nThe members of Soundgarden\u2014from left, Kim Thayil, Matt Cameron, Jason Everman, and Chris Cornell<br />\n<br />\nAs it applies to rock and roll music, the term<br />\n\"harmless\" is something of an insult. As it applies to Poi Dog Pondering, though, it simply<br />\ndescribes their attitude\u2014no insult at all. Their<br />\ndebut for Columbia, collected from two previously<br />\nreleased EPs on the diminutive Texas Hotel label,<br />\nis like aespoonful of brown sugar, sweet as confection but without the processing.<br />\nLeader/songwriter Frank Orall and the additional six Poi Dogs play mostly acoustic instruments, and quite a lot of them: flugelhorns,<br />\ncellos, Latvian lap harps, accordions, banjos,<br />\nviolins, and a battery of wood blocks and percussion all go into forming the Poi Dog sound.<br />\nOrall writes simple melodies and sets them to<br />\nsimple beats (despite the percussive rattle), but<br />\navoids sounding ordinary. This has something to<br />\ndo with his funny-oblique lyrical slant which,<br />\n<br />\nwhile producing occasionally awkward turns of<br />\nphrase (\"She says my work/is like eating oat<br />\nmeal/cold, cold, oat meal, again and again/and<br />\nshe's right\"), regards its own pretensions with<br />\nsuch self-conscious humor that you wince first,<br />\nthen smile.<br />\nThen again, it could simply be the loping tempos and sometimes choppy musicianship of the<br />\nband's playing. There are no virtuosos in the<br />\ngroup, but their ensemble playing is sufficiently<br />\naccomplished to carry the songs. Producer Mike,<br />\nStewart does a terrific job recording Poi Dog, capturing all the easy swing without sacrificing the<br />\nrich textures of their instrumentation. Audio fidelity aside, this is a recording that half of New York<br />\nCity's \"top\" producer-engineers could take a<br />\nlesson from.<br />\n<br />\n\"Poi Dog Pondering\" isn't \"important\" in the<br />\nway Tracy Chapman or U2 is supposed to<br />\nthey won't garner cover stories in Rolling Stone<br />\nor Life\u2014but don't let that stop you from listening. Call it a guilty pleasure; or better yet, simply call it a pleasure.<br />\n\u2014Mark W. Stewart<br />\nThe Dragsters\u2014Stoked (Great Jones/Island)<br />\nOn \"Stoked,\" their first album, the Dragsters<br />\ndo for the rock instrumental what aerosol cans do<br />\nfor the ozone layer. Most of the album consists<br />\nof so-called \"surf instrumentals\" that mercilessly lift the Beach Boys' style without any of the<br />\nflair or technique. Especially offensive are inept<br />\ncover versions of \"Goldfinger\"(featuring, heaven<br />\n<br />\nSee THEATER, 12<br />\n<br />\nhelp us, footsteps and gunfire) and \"Maria\" from<br />\n\"West Side Story\"(no kidding). The songs with<br />\nvocals are no better, filling a void that many<br />\ntalented musicians have worked for years to<br />\nevacuate. Low points include \"Do the Clam,\" a<br />\ntrack that yearns to be danceable but ends up purely annoying, and 'Come On Tommorrow,\" which<br />\nthe press release describes as \"Beatle-esque\"\u2014a<br />\ncomparison insulting to the memory of John Lennon, to surviving Beatles, and to the entire city<br />\nof Liverpool. \"Stoked\" might be okay at parties,<br />\nor in a convertible on the way to Ocean City.<br />\nOtherwise, forget it.<br />\n\u2014Christopher Bonanos<br />\nSee RECORDS, 11<br />\n<br />\nFilms in Brief<br />\nA guide to current film releases<br />\nLook Who's Talking<br />\nAmy Heckerling's light comedy<br />\nshouldn't even still be in theatres by<br />\nChristmas, but it earns a place in the<br />\nholiday wrap-up out of sheer popular<br />\nacclaim. Kirstie Alley plays an expecting accountant who's looking for a<br />\ngood father for her child. There's<br />\nslimy businessman George Segal on<br />\none hand, and streetwise cabbie John<br />\nTravolta (shades of his former Vinnie Barbarino character) on the<br />\nother. vying for her attention and infant. But it's all a setup for Bruce<br />\nWillis as the voice of Mikey, the<br />\nwisecracking baby who seems to be<br />\nmore intelligent than his parents.<br />\nWillis is excellently cast, and some<br />\nof his comments are remarkably incisive and spontaneous. And it's nice<br />\nto see Travolta working, even if he<br />\ndoesn't get to sing. \"Look Who's<br />\nTalking\" is like a huge jar of<br />\nGerber's Baby Food: it slides down<br />\neasily enough. hut it doesn't taste<br />\nlike anything in particular. And what<br />\na great idea for a sitcom! Forget<br />\nabout the talking baby thing.

Actually, this<br />\nlukewarm John Hughes comedy is<br />\nreminiscent of the screenwriter's<br />\n\"Planes, Trains, and Automobiles\"<br />\nbecause Chase plays a relatively successful businessman, and Clark's<br />\nyucky cousin Eddie (Randy Quaid)<br />\ndresses in leisure suits and has a dog<br />\nnamed \"Snots.\"Eddie's been out of<br />\nwork for seven years\u2014according to<br />\nhis wife. he's \"been holding out for<br />\na management position.\" Quaid is<br />\nsufficiently disgusting; he looks like<br />\nan overweight Phil Collins. Eddie,<br />\nalong with Clark's scroogelike boss<br />\nFrank (Brian Doyle-Murray) give us<br />\nall a chance to see Christmas Spirit<br />\nand What's It's All About up close<br />\nand personal.

He<br />\nsounds exactly like Zeppelin vocalist Robert<br />\nPlant\u2014what a coincidence! This record is what<br />\nI imagine one of those \"tribute\" bands would turn<br />\nout if they ever played their own material.<br />\nBonham clearly wants to tap into Led Zeppelin's<br />\nglory (and who wouldn't),but the group has none<br />\nof their idols' wit or inspiration from which to<br />\ndraw power, nor the legend with which to justify<br />\nself-indulgence. Extending a never-give-up-youcan-make-it anthem (predictably called<br />\n\"Dream\")to nearly eight minutes doesn't make<br />\nit \"Kashmir,\" or even \"Stairway to Heaven.\"<br />\nThe swishy keyboards, however, do make it sound<br />\nlike Foreigner, and that's worse than the lamest<br />\nLed Zeppelin rip-off.<br />\n\u2014Terry Swords<br />\nBilly Joel\u2014Storm Front (Columbia)<br />\nOkay, I realize that it's not too hip to be a Billy<br />\nJoel fan; realize, too, that his last few records have<br />\nbeen a little, well, thin in spots But that said,<br />\nJoel's twelfth and newest release isn't too bad.<br />\nWe're not talking about some recently unearthed<br />\nBeatles master tape here, of course: \"Storm<br />\nFront\" isn't a great record, and doesn't hold up<br />\nthat well even next to Joel's best work.<br />\nStill, Joel has toughened up his sound for<br />\n\"Storm Front,' endowing the record with an<br />\nEighties-style synthetic tone\u2014it's about time\u2014<br />\nand shoving the drums and percussion to the front<br />\nof the mix. The album kicks off with the peppy<br />\n\"That's Not Her Style,\" a commentary on the '<br />\ntabloid exploitation of an unnamed celebrity (undoubtedly his wife, model Christie Brinkley). The<br />\nnext song, \"We Didn't Start The Fire,\" is<br />\nguaranteed to elicit a reaction from every listener.<br />\nAgainst a lilting synthesizer background, Joel<br />\nrhythmically recites names, events, novels,<br />\nmovies, etc. from the past 34 years, all linked<br />\ntogether by the observation of the title.<br />\nThe rest of \"Storm Front,\" however, is more<br />\n<br />\nor less typical Billy Joel territory. \"The<br />\nDowneaster Alexa,\" about a down-and-out fisherman, begins promisingly but degenerates into truly<br />\nstupid lyrics by its final verse. And \"Leningrad,\"<br />\na song written about a friend Joel met during his<br />\ntour of the Soviet Union, is too pretentious for<br />\nits own good. In short, if you like Billy Joel<br />\nalbums, you will probably like this one. If not,<br />\nforget it. And if you do enjoy such guilty<br />\npleasures, and want to save face among your<br />\nfriends, keep it to yourself.

The<br />\nlyrics themselves intertwine dense metaphors and<br />\nimages to evoke the tension of a lover who<br />\ndesperately wants to be released. Etheridge's vocal<br />\ntone, with its smoothly smoky quality, appropriately intensifies this atmosphere. Overall,<br />\nEtheridge has produced a single reminiscent of the<br />\noutmoded Joan Jett/Pat Benatar school of<br />\nsongwriting, but of far superior quality.<br />\n\u2014Christopher Bonanos<br />\nHeretix\u2014A.D. (Island)<br />\nA strong vocal sound backed by competent<br />\nmusicianship gives \"A.D.\" an energetic hardrock feel. Heretix's six-song EP includes four<br />\noriginals of consistently solid quality. \"Always<br />\nDarkest,\" by guitarist Brian Hill, takes cues from<br />\nR.E.M.'s \"Document\" while constructing its<br />\nown, unique sound. The promising \"World Full<br />\nof Tears\" combines Edge-like guitar jangles with<br />\nclever and forceful vocals by lead singer Ray<br />\nLemieux. The rhythm section\u2014bassist Eric Hill<br />\nand drummer Marvin Huffman\u2014also exhibit<br />\nstyles influenced but not overwhelmed by their U2<br />\ncounterparts. Also included on the EP are covers<br />\nof Donov,:n's \"Season of the Witch\"\u2014it takes<br />\ncourage to cover Donovan in 1989\u2014and T. Rex's<br />\n\"Mad Donna,\" both well executed.

Coach Frank Cushman<br />\nsaid the team suffered at<br />\nWesleyan because of the lack of<br />\nexperience.<br />\nThe team's top players are<br />\nsophomore Karran Phillips and<br />\nsenior Kathryn Ng. Coach<br />\nCushman said that these two are<br />\nconstantly facing the best players<br />\nfrom other schools, who are<br />\ntypically more experienced<br />\nplayers. Phillips and Ng are<br />\nstrong competitors, but simply<br />\nhave been facing very harsh<br />\ncompetition.<br />\nThe next five players on the<br />\nsquash lineup are Natasha Dupont, Tara Dorr, Michelle<br />\nSteindecker, Rosy Dacosta, and<br />\nChristina Von Riesenfelder. Dorr<br />\nhad a clutch victory for Hopkins<br />\nagainst Cornell. Behind 11-6 in<br />\nher match, Dorr won nine of the<br />\nlast 10 points to give her a 15-12<br />\nwin. This victory was the<br />\ndeciding match against Cornell,<br />\nand gave Hopkins an impressive<br />\nwin.<br />\nThe next two players are Lian<br />\nVon Wantoch and Melissa<br />\nWilson. They are both beginning<br />\nplayers, but Cushman comments<br />\nthat they are both developing<br />\nquickly.

Although<br />\nHopkins still holds the license for<br />\nthe all-student station WJHU,<br />\nWJHU became a professionally<br />\nrun radio station in October 1986.<br />\nStudent involvement in the<br />\nradio station now consists of<br />\nselect internships in the different<br />\ndepartments of the station. The<br />\ninitial aim of the committee,<br />\ntherefore, is \"to get students on<br />\nthe air,\" explained Liddicoat.<br />\nAfter meeting with the<br />\nmanager of the University of<br />\nConnecticut radio station on<br />\nNovember 18, the committee has<br />\nlooked at alternatives to an allstudent-run radio station until<br />\nHopkins can obtain an on-air<br />\nfrequency.<br />\nThe committee is exploring the<br />\npossibility of establishing a cable<br />\nradio station through United<br />\nCable of Baltimore. By encouraging students to acquire cable,<br />\nHopkins would have a means of<br />\nfunding the operation and of increasing their listening audience.<br />\nThe committee is also considering a carrier station transmitting<br />\non the wiring in Wolman,<br />\nMcCoy, the Charles, and the<br />\nBlackstone, as well as the<br />\nHomewood campus. As Liddicoat said, such a system would<br />\nreach a \"reasonably good percentage of the school population.\"<br />\nTime-sharing on another frequency which is owned by a<br />\nBaltimore area high school has<br />\nalso been suggested.<br />\nBecause these alternative stations would not be subject to<br />\nFederal Communications Commission (FCC) regulations, the<br />\nradio station would not have to<br />\nadhere to advertising restrictions<br />\non educational stations.<br /><br />\nIn the final MSE symposium of<br />\nthe year, Henry Louis Gates, Jr.<br />\nspoke of the need for blacks to<br />\ndefine their own identity and<br />\ncriticized Hopkins for limiting the<br />\nnumbers of blacks among the<br />\nranks of students and faculty.<br />\nGates, a professor of English<br />\nliterature at Cornell, had been<br />\nscheduled to deliver a lecture entitled \"On Transforming the<br />\nAmerican Mind: Race and<br />\nCanon.\" He chose to read from<br /><br />\nSee RADIO, 3<br /><br />\nMichael Blumhardt<br /><br />\nDr. Henry Louis Gates spoke at last Monday evening's MSE Symposium<br />\nin the Garrett Room.<br /><br />\nhis manuscript of a soon-to-bepublished book about the<br />\ntransformation of the black soul<br />\nand the black identity over the<br />\ncourse of American literary<br />\nhistory instead.<br />\nGates began his talk by initially criticizing Hopkins for<br />\nestablishing the perception that its<br />\ncampus was an unwelcome place<br />\nfor blacks, especially amongst the<br />\nfaculty.

It seems that this label would<br />\nbe more \"at home\" in a statement like, 'The University<br />\ndoes not discriminate against Blacks, Women, Jews,<br /><br />\nHomosexuals, or Mexicans.' Such a statement is on the<br />\nsurface non-discriminatory, but is clearly offensive,<br />\ndiscriminatory, and oppressive.\"<br />\nThis may at first glance seem a relatively minor point,<br />\nbut it is an important distinction. The term that applications and all University documents should use is \"sexual<br />\norientation,\" rather than specifying homosexuality. It is<br />\nvital that the misleading term contained within the University's statement of non-discrimination be corrected immediately, especially if the University is sincere in its expressed desire to attract a diverse staff, faculty, and student body.<br /><br />\nThe will is not the deed (but it may be a committee)<br />\nAs the semester draws to a close, it's time for one and<br />\nall to take a moment to reflect upon exactly what Student<br />\nCouncil accomplished during the past four months. Council<br />\nfinally decided upon dates for Spring Fair after lengthy<br />\ndebates and attempts to relocate the MCATS. Discussions<br />\nwith security helped result in the installation of lights in<br />\nthe Lower Quad.<br />\nA survey conducted by the Communication Committee,<br />\nwhich attempted to assess student concerns about the Book<br />\nCenter, showed that over 80 percent of those polled supported the idea of a book swap. There is no question that<br />\nan alternative to the buy-back policy held by Barnes and<br />\nNoble has been needed for some time, and the proposed<br />\nStudent Council Books-swap is an excellent solution. To<br />\nquote Margaret Thatcher, however, the will is not the deed.<br />\nOne rather exciting potential change, as the result of<br />\nCouncil efforts, could be some improvements in the Book<br />\nCenter services at Homewood. As with anything connected<br />\nwith Barnes and Noble and Seiler's, the most rational thing<br />\nto do is adopt a we'll-believe-it-when-we-see-it attitude.<br />\nYet when the buying rush begins next semester students<br />\nwill enjoy increased security measures such as functional<br />\nlockers (a truly revolutionary concept) and bag-checkers.<br />\nSo it seems the Student Council Representatives to the<br />\nBook Center Committee have managed to initiate sane<br />\n.improvements in the way Barnes and Noble serves the<br />\nUniversity. The News-Letter hopes that Council and its<br />\nmany committees will continue their work towards<br /><br />\ncultivating a positive atmosphere here at the happy<br />\nHomewood homefront.<br /><br />\nTime for a new station<br />\nFor the first time in several years, a credible proposal<br />\nfor the return of a student run radio station has been put<br />\nforward. The transformation, in 1985, of the previously<br />\nstudent-run WJHU into a professional radio station was<br />\na regretable decision on the administration's part in the<br />\nfirst place. Although the decision to take WJHU out of<br />\nstudent hands was apparently influenced by administrative<br />\nconcern about a perceived lack of adequate student cornmittment to the station, this should not be held against current efforts at radio revival.<br />\nUniversity support for the proposed radio station would<br />\nbe an acknowledgement of extensive undergraduate efforts<br />\nto overcome a reputation for apathy, and a very positive<br />\nindicator that undergraduate needs and interests have<br />\nbecome a genuine administrative concern.<br />\nThis year's attempt to revive student radio at Hopkins<br />\nappears to be particularly well-conceived and sincerely intended. Whichever of the multiple suggestions for broadcast mediums are chosen, whether on FM or through the<br />\nUniversity's electrical system, we strongly recommend<br />\nconcrete steps towards the speedy renewal of student-run<br />\nradio at Hopkins.<br />\nHappy holidays, people.

It was<br />\neven more astonishing to see so<br />\nmany stay for the discussion<br />\nafterwards.<br /><br />\n\"Do The Right Thing\" need<br />\nonly be the beginning. There is<br />\na plethora of culturally diverse<br />\nevents in the upcoming months to<br />\nexpand everyone's horizons, but<br />\nthey all depend on Universitywide support.<br />\nTake, for example, Black<br />\nHistory Month. The Black Student's Union is working with<br />\nseveral other groups to make this<br />\nFebruary unforgettable. Umoja<br />\nSasa, an African storytelling<br />\ngroup will open the month. The<br />\nAfrican Heritage Dinner gives the<br />\ncommunity a chance to taste<br />\nnative African culinary treats, and<br />\nfeatures an African dance troupe<br />\nfor entertainment. The Grammy<br />\naward-winning gospel group<br />\nTake 6 will also perform in late<br />\nFebruary.<br />\nThese events were not scheduled only for black students. Ninety<br />\npercent of the black students have<br />\ntasted African cuisine, seen<br />\nAfrican dancers, or even sung<br />\ngospel. The events were planned<br />\nto improve cultural awareness on<br />\na previously lacking campus.<br />\nTheir success lies in your<br />\nsupport.<br />\nOn such a small, close-knit<br />\ncampus like Hopkins, there is no<br />\nneed for students not to be aware<br />\nof other cultures, religions, or interests. Take advantage of what<br />\ngroups are trying to offer; learning and education involve more<br />\nthan just reading textbooks.<br />\nAnyone interested in issues concerning black students is welcome<br />\nto attend Black Student Union<br />\nmeetings. The next meeting will<br />\nbe January 28, 1990, in the BSU<br />\nroom (basement of AMR II)<br /><br />\nGIRO ne<br />\nCONSTITUTION<br />\nThe new GRO constitution is<br />\nin place. No, it's not the most interesting document in the world,<br />\nhut at least we can now say we've<br />\ngot a useable one. There having<br />\nbeen no proposals for admendment submitted over the past<br />\nthree weeks, the GRO council apconstitution<br />\nthe<br />\nproved<br />\nunanimously. One clause was<br />\nadded at the council meeting<br />\nitself: a recall clause. Elected and<br />\nappointed officers can be recalled by three.quarters of the voting<br />\nmembers present at any given<br />\ncouncil meeting, though the recall<br />\nvote must be taken at least one<br />\nweek after the petition has been<br />\npresented.<br />\nOn a not-entirely unrelated<br />\nnote, the GRO is still working on<br />\nrepresenting you, the average<br />\ngraduate student. With delegates<br />\non various deans' and other cotn-<br /><br />\nmittees, the GRO is trying to keep<br />\nits-and your-voice heard.<br />\nBut bear with us. Results are<br />\nnot immediate. And we need your<br />\ncontinued input. So drop a line to<br />\nthe GRONews. Or, better still,<br />\ncome to a meeting or two. We're<br />\nlooking forward to seeing you all<br />\nnext semester.

The magazine's<br />\nrepresentative passed around<br /><br />\nback issues and explained the<br />\nnecessity of the Spectator's continued existence on campus.(The<br />\njournal is currently a year old.)<br />\nThe council agreed to fund the<br />\nfull amount requested.<br />\nThe council also heard an indirect request from the Sociology<br />\nDepartment's Prof. Chase-Dunn<br />\nfor partial funding for a speaker<br />\non the situation in China.

Once you start<br />\ndoing scientific research your colleagues say things like this about<br />\nyou all the time.\" So now I'm a<br />\nlittle better prepared for life.<br />\nThis week I don't think I will<br />\noffend anyone other than possibly<br />\nmy roommate. He comes from a<br />\ncattle-ranching family, so he<br />\nowes a lot to the existence of<br />\ncows. But I hate cows. There is<br />\nabsolutely nothing good about<br />\nthem. They exist so people can<br />\nhave steak and hamburgers, and<br />\nso people like James Garner can<br />\nearn money advertising beef on<br />\nTV. We don't need beef to survive. They are a luxury form of<br />\nagriculture. If we were to put all<br />\nthe resources that go into cattle<br />\nfarming into other uses, it would<br />\nbe surprising what gains could be<br />\nmade toward ending world<br />\nhunger, saving the water supplies<br />\nof the arid regions of the U.S.,<br />\nreducing degradation of public<br />\nland, saving the rain forests in<br />\nBrazil. and even reducing the<br />\nthreat of global warming. Unfortuoltely,<br />\n, I don't have the<br />\nnui,)')ers on hand to back up all<br />\nthesc itatements, but I know they<br />\nexist. 'just don't have the time<br />\nto look 'hem up right now. I can<br />\nsay that it takes an incredible<br /><br />\namount of grain and water to keep<br />\na cow running. If all the grain used in cattle feed lots was used for<br />\nfeeding people instead, we could<br />\nmake a significant dent in reducing the number of starving people in the world. Raising cows is<br />\na very inefficient use of grain<br />\nsupplies when one considers the<br />\nper pound nutrition received from<br />\nthe beef. It is a serious waste of<br />\nwater as well. One estimate is that<br />\nit takes 2500 gallons of water to<br />\nproduce a one-pound steak. Since<br />\nmuch cattle farming occurs in<br />\nareas with continuously dropping<br />\nwater tables, this is a rather<br />\nsobering fact to consider. Then<br />\nthere are the rain forests. Why<br />\ndoes much of the forest clearing<br />\noccur? So people can graze cows<br />\non the land. Where does much of<br />\nthe beef go? The U.S. Let's look<br />\nat the global warming issue.<br />\nSome say that in order to save<br />\nthe planet, humanity must first<br />\nhave a true appreciation of this<br />\nplace. We must change our<br />\nlifestyles a bit so that we are no<br />\nlonger decoupled from our environment; stop spending every<br />\nday inside cars, buildings and<br />\ncities. We need to \"get back to<br />\nnature\" by taking walks through<br />\nthe woods, watching wild<br />\nanimals, looking at the clouds,<br />\nlearning to appreciate our natural<br />\nsurroundings. But trying to appreciate nature by looking at<br />\ncows in a field or buying a painting with happy cows is a<br />\nmisguided step in this direction.<br />\nI've noticed that cows have<br />\nrecently become an increasingly<br /><br />\ncommon pop culture item . . .<br />\nyou see them on mugs, T-shirts,<br />\nTV commercials, etc. This is<br />\ndisturNing, for we would all be<br />\nbetter off if played a much reduced role in our lives.<br />\nWhen one looks at list of sources<br />\nof greenhouse gases (CO2<br />\nmethane, CFC's, etc.) one of the<br />\nsources is \"agriculture.\" One<br />\nusually thinks of agriculture as<br />\ngrowing crops. But plants absorb<br />\nCO2, so how can this be? The<br />\nmajor contribution from<br />\nagriculture is methane. And the<br />\nmethane comes from bovine<br />\nflatulents, also known as cow<br />\nfarts. Cows produce a<br />\nphenomenal amount of methane<br />\nduring normal digestion.<br />\nThe one remaining factor that<br />\nneeds to be addressed is that of<br />\nsaving the public land. Unknown<br />\nto me until last year was the fact<br />\nthat much national forest land is<br />\nleased out to cattle ranchers so<br />\ntheir cattle can graze freely.<br />\nThere are guidelines in place that<br />\nregulate how much grazing can<br />\noccur in a given area. and I like<br />\nto think they are adhered to. But<br />\nconsidering how the Forest Service is managing some of the<br />\nforests in the Pacific Northwest<br />\nand Alaska these days, I have to<br />\nwonder. Regardless of how well<br />\nthe grazing guidelines are<br />\nobeyed, the mere presence of<br />\ncows in national forests is a<br />\nnegative. For wild animals, the<br />\ncows represent competition for<br />\nfood and a source of pollution for<br />\ntheir water supplies.

The themes are cliched and universal, but the play works because it uses specificity<br />\nand anecdote to its advantage.<br />\nThe setting is Greenwich Village: the living<br />\nroom of struggling roommates Jerry (Robert Bell)<br />\nand Ginny (Pamela Becker). Jerry has just received his umpteenth rejection for an acting job, and<br />\neven the slightest transgression is enough to set<br />\nhim off.<br />\nHe isn't huffing and puffing alone for long,<br />\nhowever.

Soundgarden's celebration/parody of<br />\nraw phallic power and bare-chested maleness is<br />\nwithout doubt more engaging (and direct) than the<br />\nrituals of teenage petting and drunkenness supervised by the competition.<br />\nAlthough that alone is refreshing, it proves no<br />\nless contrived or silly after the initial fascination<br />\nwears off. Soundgarden undresses the rock cliche,<br />\nlies it down, revels in it, and leaves it apparently<br />\ndespoiled and discredited. In fact, though, the band<br />\nusually just leaves it lying, which accounts for<br />\nmuch of the record's appeal.<br />\nMusically, \"Louder Than Love\" is a rocket<br />\nride, a nail-biting trip that alternates graceful,<br />\nsmooth coasting with a turbulent, disturbing grinding. But Soundgarden, appropriately, is more<br />\nlikely to make hips swing than to elicit raised-fist<br />\nsalutes. The band's sound pays off most handsomely when it shocks or surprises\u2014although your<br />\ncup is sure to overflow once or twice in the course<br />\nof this 50-minute romp, several of the cuts bust<br />\nout too late or from too little.<br />\nThe bottom line (for those who need one):<br />\n\"Louder Than Love\" is far more provocative than<br />\nmost of the boom-boom floating around and glutting the pipes these days. It doesn't smother all<br />\nof its lumps in makeup; instead, it paves right over<br />\nthem. At the same time, \"Louder Than Love\"<br />\nis totally ridiculous and pretentious, and I wish<br />\nSoundgarden would put its collective tongue back<br />\nin its own cheek.<br />\n\u2014Terry Swords<br />\nPoi Dog Pondering\u2014Poi Dog Pondering(Texas<br />\nHotel/Columbia)<br /><br />\nThe members of Soundgarden\u2014from left, Kim Thayil, Matt Cameron, Jason Everman, and Chris Cornell<br /><br />\nAs it applies to rock and roll music, the term<br />\n\"harmless\" is something of an insult. As it applies to Poi Dog Pondering, though, it simply<br />\ndescribes their attitude\u2014no insult at all. Their<br />\ndebut for Columbia, collected from two previously<br />\nreleased EPs on the diminutive Texas Hotel label,<br />\nis like aespoonful of brown sugar, sweet as confection but without the processing.<br />\nLeader/songwriter Frank Orall and the additional six Poi Dogs play mostly acoustic instruments, and quite a lot of them: flugelhorns,<br />\ncellos, Latvian lap harps, accordions, banjos,<br />\nviolins, and a battery of wood blocks and percussion all go into forming the Poi Dog sound.<br />\nOrall writes simple melodies and sets them to<br />\nsimple beats (despite the percussive rattle), but<br />\navoids sounding ordinary. This has something to<br />\ndo with his funny-oblique lyrical slant which,<br /><br />\nwhile producing occasionally awkward turns of<br />\nphrase (\"She says my work/is like eating oat<br />\nmeal/cold, cold, oat meal, again and again/and<br />\nshe's right\"), regards its own pretensions with<br />\nsuch self-conscious humor that you wince first,<br />\nthen smile.<br />\nThen again, it could simply be the loping tempos and sometimes choppy musicianship of the<br />\nband's playing. There are no virtuosos in the<br />\ngroup, but their ensemble playing is sufficiently<br />\naccomplished to carry the songs. Producer Mike,<br />\nStewart does a terrific job recording Poi Dog, capturing all the easy swing without sacrificing the<br />\nrich textures of their instrumentation. Audio fidelity aside, this is a recording that half of New York<br />\nCity's \"top\" producer-engineers could take a<br />\nlesson from.<br /><br />\n\"Poi Dog Pondering\" isn't \"important\" in the<br />\nway Tracy Chapman or U2 is supposed to<br />\nthey won't garner cover stories in Rolling Stone<br />\nor Life\u2014but don't let that stop you from listening.

He<br />\nsounds exactly like Zeppelin vocalist Robert<br />\nPlant\u2014what a coincidence! This record is what<br />\nI imagine one of those \"tribute\" bands would turn<br />\nout if they ever played their own material.<br />\nBonham clearly wants to tap into Led Zeppelin's<br />\nglory (and who wouldn't),but the group has none<br />\nof their idols' wit or inspiration from which to<br />\ndraw power, nor the legend with which to justify<br />\nself-indulgence. Extending a never-give-up-youcan-make-it anthem (predictably called<br />\n\"Dream\")to nearly eight minutes doesn't make<br />\nit \"Kashmir,\" or even \"Stairway to Heaven.\"<br />\nThe swishy keyboards, however, do make it sound<br />\nlike Foreigner, and that's worse than the lamest<br />\nLed Zeppelin rip-off.<br />\n\u2014Terry Swords<br />\nBilly Joel\u2014Storm Front (Columbia)<br />\nOkay, I realize that it's not too hip to be a Billy<br />\nJoel fan; realize, too, that his last few records have<br />\nbeen a little, well, thin in spots But that said,<br />\nJoel's twelfth and newest release isn't too bad.<br />\nWe're not talking about some recently unearthed<br />\nBeatles master tape here, of course: \"Storm<br />\nFront\" isn't a great record, and doesn't hold up<br />\nthat well even next to Joel's best work.<br />\nStill, Joel has toughened up his sound for<br />\n\"Storm Front,' endowing the record with an<br />\nEighties-style synthetic tone\u2014it's about time\u2014<br />\nand shoving the drums and percussion to the front<br />\nof the mix. The album kicks off with the peppy<br />\n\"That's Not Her Style,\" a commentary on the '<br />\ntabloid exploitation of an unnamed celebrity (undoubtedly his wife, model Christie Brinkley). The<br />\nnext song, \"We Didn't Start The Fire,\" is<br />\nguaranteed to elicit a reaction from every listener.<br />\nAgainst a lilting synthesizer background, Joel<br />\nrhythmically recites names, events, novels,<br />\nmovies, etc. from the past 34 years, all linked<br />\ntogether by the observation of the title.<br />\nThe rest of \"Storm Front,\" however, is more<br /><br />\nor less typical Billy Joel territory. \"The<br />\nDowneaster Alexa,\" about a down-and-out fisherman, begins promisingly but degenerates into truly<br />\nstupid lyrics by its final verse. And \"Leningrad,\"<br />\na song written about a friend Joel met during his<br />\ntour of the Soviet Union, is too pretentious for<br />\nits own good. In short, if you like Billy Joel<br />\nalbums, you will probably like this one. If not,<br />\nforget it.

The<br />\nlyrics themselves intertwine dense metaphors and<br />\nimages to evoke the tension of a lover who<br />\ndesperately wants to be released. Etheridge's vocal<br />\ntone, with its smoothly smoky quality, appropriately intensifies this atmosphere. Overall,<br />\nEtheridge has produced a single reminiscent of the<br />\noutmoded Joan Jett/Pat Benatar school of<br />\nsongwriting, but of far superior quality.<br />\n\u2014Christopher Bonanos<br />\nHeretix\u2014A.D. (Island)<br />\nA strong vocal sound backed by competent<br />\nmusicianship gives \"A.D.\" an energetic hardrock feel. Heretix's six-song EP includes four<br />\noriginals of consistently solid quality. \"Always<br />\nDarkest,\" by guitarist Brian Hill, takes cues from<br />\nR.E.M.'s \"Document\" while constructing its<br />\nown, unique sound. The promising \"World Full<br />\nof Tears\" combines Edge-like guitar jangles with<br />\nclever and forceful vocals by lead singer Ray<br />\nLemieux. The rhythm section\u2014bassist Eric Hill<br />\nand drummer Marvin Huffman\u2014also exhibit<br />\nstyles influenced but not overwhelmed by their U2<br />\ncounterparts.

Plates and cups are<br />\nmade from another type of plastic<br />\nfoam, such as polystyrene.)<br />\nPolystyrene is produced by<br />\nlinking together dozens of styrene<br />\nmolecules, using heat and carcinogenic solvents like ethylene<br />\nand benzene. The amount of toxic<br />\nwaste produced by plastic foam<br />\nproducers is the fifth highest of<br />\nany industry. The raw<br />\npolystyrene is blown up with air<br />\nbubbles that make plastic foam<br />\nsuch a good insulator by forcing<br />\ngaseous chlorofluorocarbons into it.

Coach<br />\nCushman said that these two are<br />\nconstantly facing the best players<br />\nfrom other schools, who are<br />\ntypically more experienced<br />\nplayers. Phillips and Ng are<br />\nstrong competitors, but simply<br />\nhave been facing very harsh<br />\ncompetition.<br />\nThe next five players on the<br />\nsquash lineup are Natasha Dupont, Tara Dorr, Michelle<br />\nSteindecker, Rosy Dacosta, and<br />\nChristina Von Riesenfelder. Dorr<br />\nhad a clutch victory for Hopkins<br />\nagainst Cornell. Behind 11-6 in<br />\nher match, Dorr won nine of the<br />\nlast 10 points to give her a 15-12<br />\nwin.
