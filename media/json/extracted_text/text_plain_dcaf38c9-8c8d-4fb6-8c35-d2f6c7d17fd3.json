Sutton.<br />\nBALTIMORE, MD., JAN. 27, 1913<br />\nA Suggestion.<br />\n<br />\nAs the season rolls round again<br />\nfor the annual banquets of the<br />\nclasses, it is not unnatural to expect in some form or other a manifestation of the old rivalry between<br />\nsophomores and freshmen. Of itself this rivalry has some things to<br />\ncommend it: it solidifies a class and<br />\nbrings the various members into<br />\ncloser touch with one another; it<br />\ninculcates into the freshmen a respect for upperclass men, which can<br />\nbe made to subserve many useful<br />\npurposes, and it satisfies that need<br />\nof a \"custom\" or \"tradition,\" which<br />\neveryone seems to feel. There has<br />\nbeen a time in the history of the<br />\nUniversity when lower class rivalry<br />\nwas carried to a point where it became objectionable but of late<br />\nyears it has kept well within the<br />\nbounds of reason and good sense.<br />\nRaids on banquet rooms and a general smash up of dishes and furniture have become a thing of the<br />\npast; underclass banquets are no<br />\nlonger refused by first-rate hotels;<br />\nand manifestations of class spirit<br />\nhave been confined to a few harmless cases of \"kidnapping.\" Even<br />\n\"kidnapping\" has very seldom been<br />\nabused. Men have not generally<br />\nbeen captured and kept in confinement for several days, so as to cause<br />\ntheir absence from their University<br />\nduties-and to alarm their parents.<br />\nOn the day of a banquet one or<br />\ntwo men have usually been carried<br />\noff, \"imprisoned\" during the afternoon, and released after the conclusion of the banquet. The captive<br />\nhas generally enjoyed the adventure<br />\ninvolved in this experience as much<br />\nas have his captors.<br />\nIt is to be hoped that this moderation will be manifested again this<br />\nyear. In order to insure that it will<br />\nbe, THE NEWS-LETTER suggests<br />\nthat the presidents of the two lower<br />\nclasses come to an understandinothat no \"kidnappings\" shall take<br />\n<br />\nplace before the day on which a banquet is to be held. There is another<br />\nmatter which requires notice also.<br />\nAttempts have sometimes been made<br />\nto capture a man in one of the University buildings. These buildings<br />\nare occupied not only by freshmen<br />\nand sophomores, nor even by undergraduates, but also by postgraduate<br />\nstudents and members of the faculty. To the convenience of the<br />\nlatter, some regard should be had,<br />\nand such an agreement as that suggested might very well be made to<br />\nprovide that the University buildings should not be the scene of any<br />\n\"kidnappings.\"<br />\nThis is merely a suggestion. THE<br />\nNEWS-LETTER cannot see how either<br />\nof these provisions would diminish<br />\nthe sport of \"kidnapping.\" The<br />\nfirst is only a crystallization of<br />\ncustom; the second merely spares<br />\ninconvenience to certain persons<br />\nwho have a right to be considered<br />\nwithout reducing in any way the<br />\nlikelihood of a man's being caught<br />\nif he is wanted. And yet the two<br />\nwould go a long way toward making it certain that class rivalry this<br />\nyear will be characterized as last<br />\nyear and the year before by the<br />\nexercise of good judgment.<br />\n<br />\nLEMMERT<br />\n\"READY TO WEAR\" CLOTHES FOR YOUNG MEN<br />\nThe Best Merchant Tailoring Characterizes our \"Clothes.\" _<br />\nAs we make them ourselves, we are constantly adding New<br />\nModels, both in Suits and Overcoats<br />\n<br />\nLEMMERT<br />\n19 EAST FAYETTE STREET<br />\n<br />\nATTENTION!

The punishment which the agreement provides<br />\nfor a fraternity found guilty of an<br />\noffence by the Inter-Fraternity<br />\nBoard is nothing but publicity. The<br />\nverdict, then, has no other effect<br />\nthan to bring to light all the facts<br />\nin the case; and any verdict which<br />\nshould not be supported by these<br />\nfacts would bear its worthlessness<br />\non its face and could accomplish no<br />\nharm. This arrangement seems to<br />\ninsure the permanence of the agreement; for if a fraternity feels that<br />\na verdict against it is unsubstantiated, all it has to do is to publish a<br />\nstatement of its case. It is not likely<br />\ntherefore that the recent lamentable<br />\ndisagreement will disturb in any<br />\nway the unity with which the various fraternities are co-operating<br />\nfor their common interest.<br />\n<br />\nfOWNES<br />\nLOVES<br />\n\u2014the Standard<br />\nof Style\u2014here<br />\nand abroad.<br />\n<br />\nResolutions of Condolence.<br />\n<br />\nResolutions passed on the death<br />\nof H.

Alpha Delta Phi<br />\nFraternity of the Johns Hopkins<br />\nUniversity has violated Section 8 of<br />\nthe In<br />\nAgreement by<br />\n. giving an intimation to a candidate<br />\nof their willingness to receive hint<br />\nas a memb.er of their Chapter.<br />\nBy order of<br />\n\u2022THE INTER-FRATERNITY BOARD.<br />\nEarly in the year of 1912 delegates from the six fraternities at<br />\nJohns Hopkins met for the purpose<br />\nof forming some agreement by<br />\nmeans of which fraternity conditions at that College might be improved. Realizing that in order for<br />\nsuch an agreement to be of any<br />\nstrength, there must be some penalty attached to an infringement of<br />\nthe same, these delegates debated<br />\nfor a long time as to what form<br />\nthis penalty should take, and finally<br />\ndecided that to publish the names<br />\n-of both the individual and the fraternity breaking the rules, in THE<br />\nNEWS-LETTER, 011 the McCoy Hall<br />\nbulletin board, and in the semi-annual announcement which the InterFraternity Board sends to the preparatory schools of Baltimore city<br />\nand vicinity, would be the penalty<br />\nbest suited to fraternity conditions<br />\nat Hopkins. Fearing, however, that<br />\nwhen it had appeared that a violation of the agreement had occurred<br />\nthe Inter-Fraternity Board might<br />\nbe too hasty in coming to a decision,<br />\nit was agreed \u2022that a, week must<br />\nelapse between the presentation of<br />\nthe charges and the trial of the fraternity against which charges were<br />\nmade. Moreover, realizing also<br />\nthat it would be much better to have<br />\na guilty fraternity escape than to<br />\npunish an innocent one, the delegates decided that to obtain a conviction, a unanimous vote should be<br />\nnecessary (the fraternity on trial<br />\nhaving of course no vote). The<br />\ninter-fraternity agreement containing the points above mentioned was<br />\nsigned by the delegates of each of<br />\nthe six fraternities at Johns Hopkins on June II,. 1912.<br />\nOn January To, 1913, charges<br />\nwere brought against the Johns<br />\nHopkins Chapter of the Alpha Delta<br />\nPhi Fraternity. After the lapse of<br />\na week the trial was held at 5<br />\nP. M.,on Friday, January 17, in the<br />\nTrophy Room. Each witness\u201e was<br />\nsummoned singly, his testiMony<br />\nheard; and then the right of questioning him was allowed every<br />\nmember of the Board (of course<br />\nincluding the two members of the<br />\nBoard representing the Alpha Delta<br />\nPhi Fraternity). Then the two<br />\nrepresentatives of the accused fraternity presented their side of the<br />\ncase, each member of the Board was<br />\nthen given the opportunity of bringing out any points that had impressed him, either in favor of or<br />\nagainst the fraternity charged with<br />\nhaving broken the agreement, and<br />\n<br />\nthen the members of that fraternity<br />\nwere asked if, before a vote was<br />\ntaken, they had any further statement to make.' When every member of the Board had said all he desired, the chairman granted an intermission of five minutes, during<br />\nwhich each member of the Board.<br />\nconsulted with the other representatives of his fraternity as to which<br />\nway the fraternity should vote, as<br />\nthe vote in all meetings of the InterFraternity Board is taken according<br />\nto fraternities. During this intermission the chairman was asked<br />\nwhether, in case the Alpha Delta<br />\nPhi Fraternity were declared guilty,<br />\nit would be necessary to have a<br />\nunanimous vote in fixing the penalty, and the chairman interpreted<br />\nthe rules as making, in such a case,<br />\na unanimous vote necessary. The<br />\nsecretary called the roll and a delegate from each of the five fraternities sitting in judgment answered<br />\n\"guilty\" as the name of their fraternity was called.<br />\nA motion was now made that the<br />\noffending fraternity should not suffer the extreme penalty in that that<br />\npart of the penalty which has to do<br />\nwith the semi-annual announcement<br />\nto the preparatory schools should<br />\nbe omitted, but that the rest of the<br />\npenalty stipulated in the agreement<br />\nshould be imposed on the Alpha<br />\nDelta Phi Fraternify. To this motion were now presented and passed<br />\namendments to omit the name of<br />\nthe individual breaking the agreement, and to send letters to the student whom it was shown had received an intimation from the Alpha<br />\nDelta Phi Fraternity of their willingness to receive him as a member<br />\nof their chapter, to the student's<br />\nfather, and to the alumnus of the<br />\nfraternity through whom this intimation had come. It was then<br />\nmoved and passed to lay the original motion on the table until the<br />\nfollowing Monday, in order that<br />\neach member of the Board might<br />\nhave more time to think the matter<br />\nover, and might thus refrain from<br />\na too hasty decision as to the proper<br />\npenalty.<br />\nOn Monday at 5 P. M., January<br />\n20, the Inter-Fraternity Board was<br />\ncalled to order, and it was moved<br />\nand passed to take off the table the<br />\nmotion made on Friday concerning<br />\nthe penalty. Here again each member of the Board had the freedom<br />\nof the floor and the right to state<br />\nhis opinion as to what the penalty<br />\nshould be. After this discussion had<br />\nclosed, a vote was taken in the same<br />\nform as had been observed in the<br />\ntrial, and the motion over which the<br />\nBoard hadithad three days to consider, was unanimously passed.<br />\n<br />\nTherefore, the notice which has<br />\nrecently appeared on the McCoy<br />\nHall bulletin board, and which now<br />\nappears at the head of this article,<br />\nwas authorized by the Inter-Fraternity Board.<br />\n<br />\nCo-eds' Cozy Corner<br />\nThe Editor Proposes.<br />\n<br />\nThe editor of the co-ed column<br />\nhas scrupulously refrained up to<br />\nthis time from endorsing for the<br />\nStatement by Alpha Delta Phi.<br />\npresidency of this University any<br />\nThe actual offense complained of of the gentlemen who have been<br />\nis almost too absurd to be seriously prominently mentioned in the daily<br />\ncontemplated.

Sutton.<br />\nBALTIMORE, MD., JAN. 27, 1913<br />\nA Suggestion.<br /><br />\nAs the season rolls round again<br />\nfor the annual banquets of the<br />\nclasses, it is not unnatural to expect in some form or other a manifestation of the old rivalry between<br />\nsophomores and freshmen. Of itself this rivalry has some things to<br />\ncommend it: it solidifies a class and<br />\nbrings the various members into<br />\ncloser touch with one another; it<br />\ninculcates into the freshmen a respect for upperclass men, which can<br />\nbe made to subserve many useful<br />\npurposes, and it satisfies that need<br />\nof a \"custom\" or \"tradition,\" which<br />\neveryone seems to feel. There has<br />\nbeen a time in the history of the<br />\nUniversity when lower class rivalry<br />\nwas carried to a point where it became objectionable but of late<br />\nyears it has kept well within the<br />\nbounds of reason and good sense.<br />\nRaids on banquet rooms and a general smash up of dishes and furniture have become a thing of the<br />\npast; underclass banquets are no<br />\nlonger refused by first-rate hotels;<br />\nand manifestations of class spirit<br />\nhave been confined to a few harmless cases of \"kidnapping.\" Even<br />\n\"kidnapping\" has very seldom been<br />\nabused. Men have not generally<br />\nbeen captured and kept in confinement for several days, so as to cause<br />\ntheir absence from their University<br />\nduties-and to alarm their parents.<br />\nOn the day of a banquet one or<br />\ntwo men have usually been carried<br />\noff, \"imprisoned\" during the afternoon, and released after the conclusion of the banquet. The captive<br />\nhas generally enjoyed the adventure<br />\ninvolved in this experience as much<br />\nas have his captors.<br />\nIt is to be hoped that this moderation will be manifested again this<br />\nyear. In order to insure that it will<br />\nbe, THE NEWS-LETTER suggests<br />\nthat the presidents of the two lower<br />\nclasses come to an understandinothat no \"kidnappings\" shall take<br /><br />\nplace before the day on which a banquet is to be held. There is another<br />\nmatter which requires notice also.<br />\nAttempts have sometimes been made<br />\nto capture a man in one of the University buildings. These buildings<br />\nare occupied not only by freshmen<br />\nand sophomores, nor even by undergraduates, but also by postgraduate<br />\nstudents and members of the faculty. To the convenience of the<br />\nlatter, some regard should be had,<br />\nand such an agreement as that suggested might very well be made to<br />\nprovide that the University buildings should not be the scene of any<br />\n\"kidnappings.\"<br />\nThis is merely a suggestion. THE<br />\nNEWS-LETTER cannot see how either<br />\nof these provisions would diminish<br />\nthe sport of \"kidnapping.\" The<br />\nfirst is only a crystallization of<br />\ncustom; the second merely spares<br />\ninconvenience to certain persons<br />\nwho have a right to be considered<br />\nwithout reducing in any way the<br />\nlikelihood of a man's being caught<br />\nif he is wanted. And yet the two<br />\nwould go a long way toward making it certain that class rivalry this<br />\nyear will be characterized as last<br />\nyear and the year before by the<br />\nexercise of good judgment.<br /><br />\nLEMMERT<br />\n\"READY TO WEAR\" CLOTHES FOR YOUNG MEN<br />\nThe Best Merchant Tailoring Characterizes our \"Clothes.\" _<br />\nAs we make them ourselves, we are constantly adding New<br />\nModels, both in Suits and Overcoats<br /><br />\nLEMMERT<br />\n19 EAST FAYETTE STREET<br /><br />\nATTENTION!

The punishment which the agreement provides<br />\nfor a fraternity found guilty of an<br />\noffence by the Inter-Fraternity<br />\nBoard is nothing but publicity. The<br />\nverdict, then, has no other effect<br />\nthan to bring to light all the facts<br />\nin the case; and any verdict which<br />\nshould not be supported by these<br />\nfacts would bear its worthlessness<br />\non its face and could accomplish no<br />\nharm. This arrangement seems to<br />\ninsure the permanence of the agreement; for if a fraternity feels that<br />\na verdict against it is unsubstantiated, all it has to do is to publish a<br />\nstatement of its case. It is not likely<br />\ntherefore that the recent lamentable<br />\ndisagreement will disturb in any<br />\nway the unity with which the various fraternities are co-operating<br />\nfor their common interest.<br /><br />\nfOWNES<br />\nLOVES<br />\n\u2014the Standard<br />\nof Style\u2014here<br />\nand abroad.<br /><br />\nResolutions of Condolence.<br /><br />\nResolutions passed on the death<br />\nof H.

Alpha Delta Phi<br />\nFraternity of the Johns Hopkins<br />\nUniversity has violated Section 8 of<br />\nthe In<br />\nAgreement by<br />\n. giving an intimation to a candidate<br />\nof their willingness to receive hint<br />\nas a memb.er of their Chapter.<br />\nBy order of<br />\n\u2022THE INTER-FRATERNITY BOARD.<br />\nEarly in the year of 1912 delegates from the six fraternities at<br />\nJohns Hopkins met for the purpose<br />\nof forming some agreement by<br />\nmeans of which fraternity conditions at that College might be improved. Realizing that in order for<br />\nsuch an agreement to be of any<br />\nstrength, there must be some penalty attached to an infringement of<br />\nthe same, these delegates debated<br />\nfor a long time as to what form<br />\nthis penalty should take, and finally<br />\ndecided that to publish the names<br />\n-of both the individual and the fraternity breaking the rules, in THE<br />\nNEWS-LETTER, 011 the McCoy Hall<br />\nbulletin board, and in the semi-annual announcement which the InterFraternity Board sends to the preparatory schools of Baltimore city<br />\nand vicinity, would be the penalty<br />\nbest suited to fraternity conditions<br />\nat Hopkins. Fearing, however, that<br />\nwhen it had appeared that a violation of the agreement had occurred<br />\nthe Inter-Fraternity Board might<br />\nbe too hasty in coming to a decision,<br />\nit was agreed \u2022that a, week must<br />\nelapse between the presentation of<br />\nthe charges and the trial of the fraternity against which charges were<br />\nmade. Moreover, realizing also<br />\nthat it would be much better to have<br />\na guilty fraternity escape than to<br />\npunish an innocent one, the delegates decided that to obtain a conviction, a unanimous vote should be<br />\nnecessary (the fraternity on trial<br />\nhaving of course no vote). The<br />\ninter-fraternity agreement containing the points above mentioned was<br />\nsigned by the delegates of each of<br />\nthe six fraternities at Johns Hopkins on June II,. 1912.<br />\nOn January To, 1913, charges<br />\nwere brought against the Johns<br />\nHopkins Chapter of the Alpha Delta<br />\nPhi Fraternity. After the lapse of<br />\na week the trial was held at 5<br />\nP. M.,on Friday, January 17, in the<br />\nTrophy Room. Each witness\u201e was<br />\nsummoned singly, his testiMony<br />\nheard; and then the right of questioning him was allowed every<br />\nmember of the Board (of course<br />\nincluding the two members of the<br />\nBoard representing the Alpha Delta<br />\nPhi Fraternity). Then the two<br />\nrepresentatives of the accused fraternity presented their side of the<br />\ncase, each member of the Board was<br />\nthen given the opportunity of bringing out any points that had impressed him, either in favor of or<br />\nagainst the fraternity charged with<br />\nhaving broken the agreement, and<br /><br />\nthen the members of that fraternity<br />\nwere asked if, before a vote was<br />\ntaken, they had any further statement to make.' When every member of the Board had said all he desired, the chairman granted an intermission of five minutes, during<br />\nwhich each member of the Board.<br />\nconsulted with the other representatives of his fraternity as to which<br />\nway the fraternity should vote, as<br />\nthe vote in all meetings of the InterFraternity Board is taken according<br />\nto fraternities. During this intermission the chairman was asked<br />\nwhether, in case the Alpha Delta<br />\nPhi Fraternity were declared guilty,<br />\nit would be necessary to have a<br />\nunanimous vote in fixing the penalty, and the chairman interpreted<br />\nthe rules as making, in such a case,<br />\na unanimous vote necessary. The<br />\nsecretary called the roll and a delegate from each of the five fraternities sitting in judgment answered<br />\n\"guilty\" as the name of their fraternity was called.<br />\nA motion was now made that the<br />\noffending fraternity should not suffer the extreme penalty in that that<br />\npart of the penalty which has to do<br />\nwith the semi-annual announcement<br />\nto the preparatory schools should<br />\nbe omitted, but that the rest of the<br />\npenalty stipulated in the agreement<br />\nshould be imposed on the Alpha<br />\nDelta Phi Fraternify. To this motion were now presented and passed<br />\namendments to omit the name of<br />\nthe individual breaking the agreement, and to send letters to the student whom it was shown had received an intimation from the Alpha<br />\nDelta Phi Fraternity of their willingness to receive him as a member<br />\nof their chapter, to the student's<br />\nfather, and to the alumnus of the<br />\nfraternity through whom this intimation had come. It was then<br />\nmoved and passed to lay the original motion on the table until the<br />\nfollowing Monday, in order that<br />\neach member of the Board might<br />\nhave more time to think the matter<br />\nover, and might thus refrain from<br />\na too hasty decision as to the proper<br />\npenalty.<br />\nOn Monday at 5 P. M., January<br />\n20, the Inter-Fraternity Board was<br />\ncalled to order, and it was moved<br />\nand passed to take off the table the<br />\nmotion made on Friday concerning<br />\nthe penalty. Here again each member of the Board had the freedom<br />\nof the floor and the right to state<br />\nhis opinion as to what the penalty<br />\nshould be. After this discussion had<br />\nclosed, a vote was taken in the same<br />\nform as had been observed in the<br />\ntrial, and the motion over which the<br />\nBoard hadithad three days to consider, was unanimously passed.<br /><br />\nTherefore, the notice which has<br />\nrecently appeared on the McCoy<br />\nHall bulletin board, and which now<br />\nappears at the head of this article,<br />\nwas authorized by the Inter-Fraternity Board.<br /><br />\nCo-eds' Cozy Corner<br />\nThe Editor Proposes.<br /><br />\nThe editor of the co-ed column<br />\nhas scrupulously refrained up to<br />\nthis time from endorsing for the<br />\nStatement by Alpha Delta Phi.<br />\npresidency of this University any<br />\nThe actual offense complained of of the gentlemen who have been<br />\nis almost too absurd to be seriously prominently mentioned in the daily<br />\ncontemplated.

($1.25.)<br />\nOf late years there has been<br />\ngrowing up a school of public speakers whose aim is not to invest their<br />\nsubject with the pomp and dignity<br />\nof old fashioned oratory, but to approach their audience in as direct,<br />\neasy and intimate a way as they<br />\ncan, and get as quickly as possible<br />\nto the plain facts of the case. This<br />\nis the ideal which underlies Professor Pearson's little volume. His<br />\npurpose is to show the student how<br />\nto talk as intelligently and convincingly on a subject which he knows<br />\nsomething about. The new speaking is not merely useful to the lawyer, the preacher, and the statesman, as was the old, but offers an<br />\nintensely valuable tool to the salesman, the engineer, and the business man\u2014to every one in fact who<br />\ncomes into contact with other persons and has to communicate with<br />\nthem by means of language.<br />\nThe book is divided into two<br />\nparts\u2014a general discussion of the<br />\nprinciples of extemporaneous speaking and a selection of illustrative<br />\nspeeches.
