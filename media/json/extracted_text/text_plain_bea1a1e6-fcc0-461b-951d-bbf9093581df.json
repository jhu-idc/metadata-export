Soper's venerable<br />\nfrankness, we fear that his honest search for a solution to the<br />\ncurrent conflict between national security and academic freedom has<br />\nled him into an intellectual dead-end.<br />\nIf we interpret the Judge's recent remarks correctly, he is convinced that professors are akin to the clergy in that they are \"members of a sacred order\"; this membership imposes a heavy responsibility upon the professor, not the least part of which is that \"he is<br />\nnot free to speak unless he is sure he is right\"; he concludes that if<br />\nthe professor gives evidence of a neglect of this responsibility, his<br />\ncolleagues and, ultimately, the University \"owe it to ... the academic<br />\nworld to expose the error of ways.\"<br />\nHerein lies the impasse. Universities are dedicated to the search<br />\nfor truth, for the \"right.\" There is no 'other justification for their<br />\nexistence. Has our hysterical scramble for security so blinded us that<br />\nwe no longer consider this a valid assumption? Would Judge Soper<br />\nlave us use that for which we labor, that which we have not yet found,<br />\nas the standard for judging the utterances of those who labor? This<br />\nseems to be the absurdity to which Judge Soper's srgument is reduced.<br />\nBecause we are still convinced that security can only be preserved by complete freedom of thought and expression, despite the<br />\npresent concern over \"a clear and present danger,\" and because we<br />\nare still dedicated to the assumption that truth will not\u2022 be found<br />\nin agreement and conformity but must be sought in the lonely confines<br />\nof a mind free from authoritarian restrictions, we can not accept<br />\nJudge Soper's conclusion.<br />\nThat \"a clear and present danger exists,\" we do not deny. We<br />\nshould like to suggest, however, that it is not necessarily represented<br />\nby the Communists and their sympathizers. Henry Steele Commager<br />\n(professor of history at Columbia University), in his article entitled<br />\n'Is Freedom Really Necessary\" published this month by the Saturday<br />\nReview, has pointed out a second alternative. Professor Commager<br />\nasks us first to \"fasten our attention on consequences\" when considering the conflict between freedom and security. \"What happens,\" he<br />\nasks,\"when a state tries to purge its state universities or a community<br />\ntries to purge its public schools of alleged subversives?\" He answers:<br />\n<br />\nThe following is a memorandum for graduate students in Political Science written by Professor<br />\nCarl Brent Swisher, Thomas Strand Professor of Political Science.

Soper's venerable<br />\nfrankness, we fear that his honest search for a solution to the<br />\ncurrent conflict between national security and academic freedom has<br />\nled him into an intellectual dead-end.<br />\nIf we interpret the Judge's recent remarks correctly, he is convinced that professors are akin to the clergy in that they are \"members of a sacred order\"; this membership imposes a heavy responsibility upon the professor, not the least part of which is that \"he is<br />\nnot free to speak unless he is sure he is right\"; he concludes that if<br />\nthe professor gives evidence of a neglect of this responsibility, his<br />\ncolleagues and, ultimately, the University \"owe it to ... the academic<br />\nworld to expose the error of ways.\"<br />\nHerein lies the impasse. Universities are dedicated to the search<br />\nfor truth, for the \"right.\" There is no 'other justification for their<br />\nexistence. Has our hysterical scramble for security so blinded us that<br />\nwe no longer consider this a valid assumption? Would Judge Soper<br />\nlave us use that for which we labor, that which we have not yet found,<br />\nas the standard for judging the utterances of those who labor? This<br />\nseems to be the absurdity to which Judge Soper's srgument is reduced.<br />\nBecause we are still convinced that security can only be preserved by complete freedom of thought and expression, despite the<br />\npresent concern over \"a clear and present danger,\" and because we<br />\nare still dedicated to the assumption that truth will not\u2022 be found<br />\nin agreement and conformity but must be sought in the lonely confines<br />\nof a mind free from authoritarian restrictions, we can not accept<br />\nJudge Soper's conclusion.<br />\nThat \"a clear and present danger exists,\" we do not deny. We<br />\nshould like to suggest, however, that it is not necessarily represented<br />\nby the Communists and their sympathizers. Henry Steele Commager<br />\n(professor of history at Columbia University), in his article entitled<br />\n'Is Freedom Really Necessary\" published this month by the Saturday<br />\nReview, has pointed out a second alternative. Professor Commager<br />\nasks us first to \"fasten our attention on consequences\" when considering the conflict between freedom and security. \"What happens,\" he<br />\nasks,\"when a state tries to purge its state universities or a community<br />\ntries to purge its public schools of alleged subversives?\" He answers:<br /><br />\nThe following is a memorandum for graduate students in Political Science written by Professor<br />\nCarl Brent Swisher, Thomas Strand Professor of Political Science. It was distributed on November<br />\n3, 1952.<br />\nIt rerved as the source for an article .entitled \"As I See It\" in the Nov. 21 issue of the News.<br />\nLetter.
