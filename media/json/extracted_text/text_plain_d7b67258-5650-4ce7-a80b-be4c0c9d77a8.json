They have<br />\n.told, in glowing panegyric, of the advancement of the University<br />\nwithin the past ten years. It is enough for us to say, therefore,<br />\nin these few words, that we hope that the fourth president of<br />\nJohns Hopkins University will carry aloft her standards as gloriously as the third has done.<br />\n<br />\nLEVERING HALL<br />\nWithin the next few weeks the Y. M. C. A. will begin its drive<br />\nto secure the $165,000 necessary for the erection of the proposed<br />\nLevering Hall, the status of which has been a matter'of considerable; conjecture and discussion on the campus. It has been referred to as a Student Activities Building, a Y. M. C. A. Building<br />\nand simply as a Students' Building. Inasmuch as it is quite<br />\nprobable that the students of the University will be asked to<br />\ncontribute to the fund, we feel that the status of the building<br />\nshould be clearly defined to the student body.<br />\nFirst of all, it should _be understood that Levering Hall will<br />\nnot be a Student Activities Building. According to the Y. M. C. A.<br />\nauthorities, any student activity which desires to use any of the<br />\n\u2022.various meeting rooms will always be extended this privilege,<br />\nalthough no space will be specifically allocated to any individual<br />\nbody. The activities will retain their offices in the Barn, which<br />\nwill be devoted to their use until the activities themselves should<br />\ngo out of existence.<br />\nThe new building will assume the nature of a clubhouse, a<br />\npurpose for which the Barn is so patently inadequate. It will<br />\nbe a comfortable, attractive place where the students may lounge<br />\nduring their lunch hour or other free time. And the most tangible feature of Levering Hall will be a cafeteria, where students<br />\nand faculty can enjoy eating their meals.<br />\nOf course, the building will nominally belong to the Y. M. C. A.<br />\nAnd although we believe that the more feasible plan would be<br />\n.to have the building under the direct control of the University,<br />\nthe latter's absolute lack of funds for the purpose makes the<br />\nscheme impossible. There is every reason to believe, however,<br />\nthat the Y. M. C. A. will administer Levering Hall wisely and<br />\nunselfishly.

As for writing,<br />\nPresident Goodnow does not apparently intend to publish any books<br />\nafter his retirement.<br />\nThat Dr. Goodnow will not continue to be connected with the University in any capacity, except possibly that of President Emeritus, is<br />\nan established fact.

To mention both in the same breath is perhaps to slight the former. It was<br />\nthe President's idea to bring Johns<br />\nHopkins back to the unrivaled reputation as an institution for research<br />\nand for the discovery of new truth<br />\nwhich it had held under Dr. Gilman.

Many reforms have been adopted in an attempt to encourage as many students as possible to participate in<br />\nsome form of athletic activity or<br />\nsporting endeavor, and to incidentally decrease the past expenses and<br />\nlosses which the athletic association<br />\nhas experienced in past years. Boxing, wrestling, fencing, tennis,<br />\nhockey, golf, soccer and rifle are<br />\nthe sports which have been dropped<br />\nfrom the roster. Football, basketball, rowing, cross-country, lacrosse,<br />\nswimming and water polo are the<br />\nonly activities which have been considered as worthy of retention. This<br />\nPlan was originally intended to have<br />\ngone into effect at the beginning of<br />\nthis scholastic year but, because<br />\nof a definite outburst of sentiment<br />\namong the student body, the plan<br />\nwas placed under reconsideration<br />\nby the athletic council, who recently<br />\nrepassed it.<br />\nAs a fact which may be-of interest to sport followers and especially<br />\ngrid enthusiasts, it has been computed that out of the seventy-one<br />\nfootball captains who have been<br />\nselected to head their teams for next<br />\nyear, forty-five, or over two-thirds<br />\nof the total, are linesmen,' while<br />\nonly the remaining twenty-six are<br />\nbackfield players. The days when<br />\nit was. customary for the quarterback to be the leader appear to have<br />\nvanished.

An endeavor is being made<br />\nto schedule sixteen games, two to<br />\nbe played on each Saturday of the<br />\n1928 campaign, at least one of<br />\nwhich will be played away from<br />\nhome. This action is said to be a<br />\nresult of the recent Big Ten conference, which passed a resolution permitting every member to card two<br />\ngames each Saturday and excepting<br />\nthem from the former home and<br />\nhome scrimmage regulation.<br />\n* * * * *<br />\nOxford and Cambridge universities are said to be planning a new<br />\nform of intercollegiate competition.<br />\nThe two institutions are arranging<br />\nflying contests, which will take place<br />\nannually.

Loyola was<br />\nhandicapped by the clever work of<br />\nDebuskey, Hopkins center, who outjumped his opponent in every start.<br />\nIncidentally, the Black and Blue<br />\npivot man contributed more to the<br />\nfinal count than did any of his<br />\nmates, accounting for six tallies and<br />\nplaying a wonderful floor game.<br />\nThe rare work of the team as a<br />\nunit, however, is shown by the fact<br />\nthat each man tallied at least three<br />\npoints.<br />\nDudley High Scorer<br />\n<br />\nCaptain Frank Dudley, high<br />\nscorer for the Green and Gray, was<br />\nundoubtedly the star of the contest.<br />\nIn spite of his great effort, however, his charges were decisively<br />\noutplayed, especially during the first<br />\nperiod. At the half the Jays were<br />\non the long end of a 16-9 score.<br />\nAlthough Loyola tied the score<br />\nnear the close of the contest, Passerew's shot from the floor dashed<br />\nany hopes of the Irish for a victory.<br />\nScore and summary:<br />\nHopkins<br />\nT<br />\nLanyan, f<br />\n3<br />\n3-3<br />\n9<br />\n2<br />\nPasserew, f.<br />\n0-1<br />\n4<br />\nDebuskey, c.<br />\n2<br />\n2-3<br />\n6<br />\nKaufman, g<br />\n1<br />\n1-1<br />\n3<br />\nLang, g.<br />\n2<br />\n4<br />\n0-0<br />\n<br />\nCASUAL CONDUCT OF CAMPUS COUPLES<br />\nCAUSES COTILLON CLUB CONCERN<br />\n\"Something for nothing\" is usually mighty hard to get, and it has<br />\nbeen claimed by some bitter souls<br />\nthat this is particularly true at Hopkins. But, at last a campus organization has blazed the trail; it has<br />\ndeclared that, for once, it will depart from its traditional policy and<br />\ngive the boys a treat. The benevolent souls who originated this charitable idea are none other than the<br />\nmembers of the Johns Hopkins<br />\nCotillon Club.<br />\nIn an effort to correct the bad<br />\nhabits of those naughty \"collich\"<br />\nboys who habitually straggle into<br />\ndances when they are nearly over,<br />\nthis puritanical organization has decided to put a premium on punctuality. The first three couples to<br />\narrive at the Cotillon Club dance tomorrow night may enter scot free.<br />\nVerily, \"the early bird catches the<br />\nworm,\" but the club still maintains<br />\nthat \"it is better to come late than<br />\nnot at all.\" Nevertheless, it is to<br />\nbe noted that the club's charity ap<br />\ninscription, however, does not tell<br />\nall. Shuter was a pioneer in the<br />\nstudent activities at Johns Hopkins.<br />\nBack in 1897-98 the NEWS-LETTER<br />\nwas first printed, and Shuter was<br />\nits first Business Manager.<br />\nPhoto of Foch<br />\n<br />\nplies only to couples and does not<br />\nextend to the stag line. Come early<br />\nand avoid the rush.<br />\nThe dance will start promptly at<br />\nnine and it is expected that Goucher<br />\ngirlies will benefit especially by the<br />\nnew arrangement. A number of<br />\nladies have recently been heard<br />\ncomplaining that these innocent<br />\nyoung ladies are kept out after<br />\nhours Saturday at Hopkins dances.<br />\nIf the novel scheme works the parties may start early and end early.<br />\nThus, the girls can get their much<br />\nneeded beauty sleeps and a few<br />\nHopkins escorts may be able to find<br />\na solution to the problem of how to<br />\ndo on the weeks' allowance.<br />\nA.

They have<br />\n.told, in glowing panegyric, of the advancement of the University<br />\nwithin the past ten years. It is enough for us to say, therefore,<br />\nin these few words, that we hope that the fourth president of<br />\nJohns Hopkins University will carry aloft her standards as gloriously as the third has done.<br /><br />\nLEVERING HALL<br />\nWithin the next few weeks the Y. M. C. A. will begin its drive<br />\nto secure the $165,000 necessary for the erection of the proposed<br />\nLevering Hall, the status of which has been a matter'of considerable; conjecture and discussion on the campus. It has been referred to as a Student Activities Building, a Y. M. C. A. Building<br />\nand simply as a Students' Building. Inasmuch as it is quite<br />\nprobable that the students of the University will be asked to<br />\ncontribute to the fund, we feel that the status of the building<br />\nshould be clearly defined to the student body.<br />\nFirst of all, it should _be understood that Levering Hall will<br />\nnot be a Student Activities Building. According to the Y. M. C. A.<br />\nauthorities, any student activity which desires to use any of the<br />\n\u2022.various meeting rooms will always be extended this privilege,<br />\nalthough no space will be specifically allocated to any individual<br />\nbody. The activities will retain their offices in the Barn, which<br />\nwill be devoted to their use until the activities themselves should<br />\ngo out of existence.<br />\nThe new building will assume the nature of a clubhouse, a<br />\npurpose for which the Barn is so patently inadequate. It will<br />\nbe a comfortable, attractive place where the students may lounge<br />\nduring their lunch hour or other free time. And the most tangible feature of Levering Hall will be a cafeteria, where students<br />\nand faculty can enjoy eating their meals.<br />\nOf course, the building will nominally belong to the Y. M. C. A.<br />\nAnd although we believe that the more feasible plan would be<br />\n.to have the building under the direct control of the University,<br />\nthe latter's absolute lack of funds for the purpose makes the<br />\nscheme impossible. There is every reason to believe, however,<br />\nthat the Y. M. C. A. will administer Levering Hall wisely and<br />\nunselfishly.

To mention both in the same breath is perhaps to slight the former. It was<br />\nthe President's idea to bring Johns<br />\nHopkins back to the unrivaled reputation as an institution for research<br />\nand for the discovery of new truth<br />\nwhich it had held under Dr. Gilman.

Many reforms have been adopted in an attempt to encourage as many students as possible to participate in<br />\nsome form of athletic activity or<br />\nsporting endeavor, and to incidentally decrease the past expenses and<br />\nlosses which the athletic association<br />\nhas experienced in past years. Boxing, wrestling, fencing, tennis,<br />\nhockey, golf, soccer and rifle are<br />\nthe sports which have been dropped<br />\nfrom the roster. Football, basketball, rowing, cross-country, lacrosse,<br />\nswimming and water polo are the<br />\nonly activities which have been considered as worthy of retention. This<br />\nPlan was originally intended to have<br />\ngone into effect at the beginning of<br />\nthis scholastic year but, because<br />\nof a definite outburst of sentiment<br />\namong the student body, the plan<br />\nwas placed under reconsideration<br />\nby the athletic council, who recently<br />\nrepassed it.<br />\nAs a fact which may be-of interest to sport followers and especially<br />\ngrid enthusiasts, it has been computed that out of the seventy-one<br />\nfootball captains who have been<br />\nselected to head their teams for next<br />\nyear, forty-five, or over two-thirds<br />\nof the total, are linesmen,' while<br />\nonly the remaining twenty-six are<br />\nbackfield players.

Loyola was<br />\nhandicapped by the clever work of<br />\nDebuskey, Hopkins center, who outjumped his opponent in every start.<br />\nIncidentally, the Black and Blue<br />\npivot man contributed more to the<br />\nfinal count than did any of his<br />\nmates, accounting for six tallies and<br />\nplaying a wonderful floor game.<br />\nThe rare work of the team as a<br />\nunit, however, is shown by the fact<br />\nthat each man tallied at least three<br />\npoints.<br />\nDudley High Scorer<br /><br />\nCaptain Frank Dudley, high<br />\nscorer for the Green and Gray, was<br />\nundoubtedly the star of the contest.<br />\nIn spite of his great effort, however, his charges were decisively<br />\noutplayed, especially during the first<br />\nperiod. At the half the Jays were<br />\non the long end of a 16-9 score.<br />\nAlthough Loyola tied the score<br />\nnear the close of the contest, Passerew's shot from the floor dashed<br />\nany hopes of the Irish for a victory.<br />\nScore and summary:<br />\nHopkins<br />\nT<br />\nLanyan, f<br />\n3<br />\n3-3<br />\n9<br />\n2<br />\nPasserew, f.<br />\n0-1<br />\n4<br />\nDebuskey, c.<br />\n2<br />\n2-3<br />\n6<br />\nKaufman, g<br />\n1<br />\n1-1<br />\n3<br />\nLang, g.<br />\n2<br />\n4<br />\n0-0<br /><br />\nCASUAL CONDUCT OF CAMPUS COUPLES<br />\nCAUSES COTILLON CLUB CONCERN<br />\n\"Something for nothing\" is usually mighty hard to get, and it has<br />\nbeen claimed by some bitter souls<br />\nthat this is particularly true at Hopkins. But, at last a campus organization has blazed the trail; it has<br />\ndeclared that, for once, it will depart from its traditional policy and<br />\ngive the boys a treat. The benevolent souls who originated this charitable idea are none other than the<br />\nmembers of the Johns Hopkins<br />\nCotillon Club.<br />\nIn an effort to correct the bad<br />\nhabits of those naughty \"collich\"<br />\nboys who habitually straggle into<br />\ndances when they are nearly over,<br />\nthis puritanical organization has decided to put a premium on punctuality. The first three couples to<br />\narrive at the Cotillon Club dance tomorrow night may enter scot free.<br />\nVerily, \"the early bird catches the<br />\nworm,\" but the club still maintains<br />\nthat \"it is better to come late than<br />\nnot at all.\" Nevertheless, it is to<br />\nbe noted that the club's charity ap<br />\ninscription, however, does not tell<br />\nall. Shuter was a pioneer in the<br />\nstudent activities at Johns Hopkins.<br />\nBack in 1897-98 the NEWS-LETTER<br />\nwas first printed, and Shuter was<br />\nits first Business Manager.<br />\nPhoto of Foch<br /><br />\nplies only to couples and does not<br />\nextend to the stag line. Come early<br />\nand avoid the rush.<br />\nThe dance will start promptly at<br />\nnine and it is expected that Goucher<br />\ngirlies will benefit especially by the<br />\nnew arrangement. A number of<br />\nladies have recently been heard<br />\ncomplaining that these innocent<br />\nyoung ladies are kept out after<br />\nhours Saturday at Hopkins dances.<br />\nIf the novel scheme works the parties may start early and end early.<br />\nThus, the girls can get their much<br />\nneeded beauty sleeps and a few<br />\nHopkins escorts may be able to find<br />\na solution to the problem of how to<br />\ndo on the weeks' allowance.<br />\nA.
