Eisenhower<br />\nHead Librarian David Stam<br />\nsubmitted a 33 page report<br />\nexamining the library's problems<br />\nbefore he left this summer to<br />\nbecome head research librarian of<br />\nthe New York Public Library.<br />\nProvost Richard Longaker<br />\ncommissioned the report,<br />\nspecifying that it be critical and<br />\nl\u2022 hard-hitting.<br />\nAccording to Dr. Stam , the<br />\nLibrary's major short-comings are<br />\n3, a<br />\nlack of coordination with<br />\nadministration planning,<br />\ncollection development, funding,<br />\n<br />\nMaryland Governor Candidates<br />\nSpeak At JHU About Family Issues<br />\nBY BOB RIGGS<br />\nMaryland gubernatorial<br />\ncandidates Harry Hughes and J.<br />\nGlenn Beall appeared on campus<br />\nWednesday morning in the<br />\nListening-Viewing room for a<br />\npanel discussion sponsored by<br />\nthe Maryland Coalition on<br />\nFamilies.<br />\nUnder the program format,<br />\nboth men responded to questions<br />\nsubmitted by the audience. Beall,<br />\nthe former G.O.P. United States<br />\nSenator from Allegheny County<br />\nin western Maryland, cited the<br />\nwelfare system as a harmful<br />\ninfluence on poor families. \"One<br />\nof the biggest deterrents to the<br />\nfamily structure as we have it<br />\ntoday is our welfare system,\" he<br />\nsaid. \"It is the government itself<br />\nthat is causing the break-up of<br />\nfamilies among lower-income<br />\ngroups.\"<br />\nHughes, who was Maryland's<br />\nSecretary of Transportation for<br />\nthe past seven years before<br />\nresigning May 26 to enter the<br />\nDemon- vie gubernatorial<br />\nprimary, mentioned crime by<br />\nyouth and the rehabilitation of<br />\nyoung offenders as chief issues<br />\nconcerning families in the state.<br />\n\"The entire juvenile justice<br />\nsystem needs to be revamped<br />\nfrom top to bottom; from police<br />\non one end to the courts up on<br />\n<br />\nthe other, and all that goes in<br />\nbetween,\" he commented.<br />\nBoth candidates declined to<br />\ncommit themselves to<br />\nfamily-oriented projects which<br />\nwould involve the creation of<br />\nnew agencies or expansion of<br />\nexisting ones. Hughes noted that<br />\n\"people today feel more than<br />\never before government can't do<br />\neverything for everybody.\"<br />\nInstead, Hughes emphasized<br />\nopenness of the government as a<br />\n<br />\nmeans for resolving problems. \"It<br />\nis incumbent on us as public<br />\nmeetings around the state -- I call<br />\nthem 'town meetings'. As<br />\nSecretary of Transportation, I<br />\nheld these meetings, and every<br />\ntime I came away having learned<br />\nsomething.\"<br />\nBeall stressed economic<br />\nconditions and policy in many of<br />\nhis responses. \"We need more<br />\npublic input into the budget<br />\ncont. on p. 8<br />\n<br />\nDemocratic Gubernatorial candidate'Harry Hughes<br />\n<br />\nand space.<br />\nStam<br />\ncharges that the<br />\nlibrarian is not included in<br />\nUniversity planning, nor does he<br />\nmeet with the deans to plan<br />\naccommodations for new<br />\ndepartments. Moreover, the<br />\nadministration sets no overall<br />\ngoals , leaving the Library to<br />\ncope with new developments in a<br />\nhasty, improvised manner.\"What<br />\nis needed is a structured<br />\ninvolvement in University and<br />\nacademic planning, possibly<br />\nthrough membership in the<br />\nCouncil of Deans and curricular<br />\ncommittees and attendance at<br />\nmonthly departmental<br />\nchairpersons' meetings,\" Stam<br />\nsuggests. Stam<br />\nbelieves that<br />\nadministration budget guidance is<br />\nalso essential.<br />\nHe emphasizes that conflicting<br />\nneeds of undergraduates,<br />\ngraduate students, professors,<br />\nnew departments, Library<br />\nworkers, outside users, donors,<br />\nand the administration<br />\ncontribute to<br />\netunting<br />\ncollection development. At<br />\nHopkins, the Library's primary<br />\nemphasis is on the individual<br />\n<br />\nresearch needs of the Arts and<br />\nSciences faculty \"regardless of<br />\nthe permanent usefulness of<br />\nthose materials, regardless of.the<br />\nneed for comprehensive growth<br />\nof these collections, and<br />\nregardless of the changing<br />\nstrengths and weaknesses of the<br />\nacademic program.\"<br />\nNew departments, such as<br />\nAnthropology are very costly in<br />\nterms of additional resources,<br />\nand Stall, thinks the Library<br />\ncould not adapt to many more<br />\nsuch additions. (Currently, the<br />\nLibrary can not even afford to<br />\npurchase many scholarly works<br />\nproduced within the university<br />\nitself) The Library also feels<br />\npressure from the wide range of<br />\nEvening College courses. Stain<br />\nbelieves that the solution to these<br />\nconflicting demands lies in<br />\n\"shared resources,\" rather than<br />\nself-sufficiency. He foresees more<br />\nmicrofilm and collection<br />\ndistributing throughout various<br />\nuniversity and area libraries.

But in the careers<br />\nprogram sponsored this week by the Student Council,<br />\nundergraduates here demonstrated that the average Hoppie<br />\nis not willing to be stimulated.<br />\nThe forum this week brought some scintillating people<br />\nfrom the Baltimore area on campus to meet students. In the<br />\nmedia field alone, alumni such as Michael Hill, T.V.<br />\ncolumnist for the Evening Sun, and Bill Tanton, the veteran<br />\nsports editor for the same paper, were fascinating. The<br />\nevent presented a rare opportunity for conversing with<br />\nthem informally. Equally interesting individuals appeared in<br />\nmost of the other \"career fields\".<br />\nBut Hopkins students proved themselves unwilling to<br />\nleave their pompous posteriors. Only about 40 people at<br />\nmost made it to each of the three sessions this week, a<br />\npitifully poor performance. Granted, the Council's<br />\nadvertising for the forum foolishly focused on free food<br />\nmore than on the guests scheduled to appear. But the<br />\nundergraduate response was clear enough. They aren't<br />\ninterested in career counseling. They think the path to<br />\nsuccess is simple enough -- just go to med school, or law<br />\nschool, or grad school a\u2014cln the job, the career, the life will<br />\nbe out there waiting for them. That outlook is an illusion.<br />\nMost Hoppies will leave the University shelter soon enough<br />\nfor the storm and struggle of the seal world. For a meager<br />\nfew, the forum was a good preview.<br />\n<br />\nLibrary Crisis<br />\nDavid Stam's report on the condition of the M.S.E.<br />\nLibrary was surprising, but not really shocking to people<br />\nwho arc familiar with the situation. The administration<br />\ndevotes little effort to solving the library's problems. Yet<br />\nthe University dedicates itself to new engineering schools<br />\nand biology buildings. This shows an intolerable neglect for<br />\nliberal education.<br />\nPresident Muller piously professes to believe that the<br />\nhumanities at Hopkins are among the ,strongest in the<br />\nnation, and that they are growing even stronger. But in the<br />\nnext breath he says they are cheaper to maintain because,<br />\nunlike the sciences, they require no constant technical<br />\nmodernization.<br />\nThe current library crisis underscores the fallacy in this<br />\nclaim. The most important work in just about every field of<br />\nstudy is going on now. To be the best, a University must<br />\nhave available the most recent research in every field. This<br />\nrequires an active, ever-growing library. For the M.S.E.<br />\nLibrary to remain static is to sink it into the mire of<br />\nmediocrity. And it will take the whole University with it.<br />\n<br />\n.1111.<br />\n\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022<br />\n<br />\nay.<br />\n<br />\nI -101-/, ./.<br />\n<br />\nArr<br />\n<br />\nMisuse Of Hopkins Name Must End<br />\nBY DAN WILE<br />\nMorality is a peculiar concept.<br />\nAlthough it is nearly impossible<br />\nto either fully define or practice,<br />\nit is often used as the<br />\njustification for actions trivial<br />\nand substantial, kind and bestial.<br />\nProfessor Hans Morgenthau<br />\nwrote thirty years age that our<br />\nLiberal heritage refuses to<br />\nacknowledge that frequent<br />\nnecessity of adopting amoral<br />\ntactics in pursuit of what are<br />\nconceived as moral goals in<br />\nforeign affairs. Thus the morality<br />\nargument is gooily and<br />\ndestructively seductive, rather<br />\nlike the honeydew plant that<br />\nlures insects to its fatally sticky<br />\ntentacles. In our culture, the<br />\nperson who appears to embody<br />\nmorality in effect possesses a<br />\nspecial and potentially abusive<br />\npower, either intentional or<br />\nunintentional. -Such is the case<br />\nwith the Chaplain's Office, and<br />\nthat is why it should stay as far<br />\naway from politics as possible<br />\n(i.e., it ought to stop<br />\nco-sponsoring rallies or forums<br />\nby such groups as NORML, the<br />\nConcerned Citizens Against the<br />\nAPL, and the New Political<br />\nCaucus).<br />\nThe political activities of the<br />\nChaplain's Office are especially<br />\ntroubling given its special<br />\nposition within the University.<br />\nSince JHU contains students of<br />\nmany faiths, the Office is quite<br />\nproperly nonsectarian. But, if it<br />\ncannot spread the Gospel, what<br />\n<br />\nI<br />\n<br />\ncan it do? In a school where<br />\nstudents compete rapaciously for<br />\ngrades, bedpartners, and fame'n'<br />\nfortune, the Office should<br />\nentourage people to think about<br />\nspiritual issues, and it should<br />\npromote the welfare of our<br />\nfellow man. Most churches of the<br />\nworld engage in these good<br />\nworks. The Chaplain's Office<br />\nfulfills these duties to a certain<br />\nextent through its Criminal<br />\nJustice and Tutoring programs, as<br />\nwell as in the Sunday Experience.<br />\nIt raises money for these<br />\nactivities through providing such<br />\nservices as auctions, coffee<br />\nhouses and film screenings.<br />\nHowever, the Chaplain's Office<br />\nis also part of the University<br />\nbureaucracy. University funds<br />\nhelp support it, and it is entitled<br />\nto use the University name in all<br />\nof its activities. In effect,<br />\nwhatever it does carries the<br />\nindirect sanction of the<br />\nUniversity and the financial<br />\nsources that support JHU.<br />\nFurthermore, the Chaplain<br />\nappears at such official functions<br />\nas Commencement and<br />\nCommencement Day. The Office<br />\nhas a double legitimacy created<br />\nby its tics to the University and<br />\nto God.<br />\nhereini lies the danger of<br />\npolitical involvement. Many<br />\ngroups whose meetings are<br />\nco-sponsored by the Chaplain's<br />\nOffice are apparently composed<br />\nlargely of outsiders, with but a<br />\nfew undergraduates as members,<br />\nand such organizations are not'<br />\n<br />\nmembers of the Student<br />\nActivities Commission. It is only<br />\nthe affiliation with the Chaplain's<br />\nOffice that permits them to use<br />\nUniversity facilities free of<br />\ncharge. The Office's link with the<br />\nAdministration means that the<br />\nUniversity and money givers are<br />\ntacitly supporting both<br />\nnon-University activities and<br />\npolitical views of which they may<br />\nvery well not approve. That the<br />\nChaplain's Office serves as the<br />\nagent for this acceptance<br />\nprovides the necessary moral<br />\nsalve.<br />\nSome will argue that the<br />\nUniversity subsidizes such<br />\npolitical groups as the Young<br />\nDemocrats and the College<br />\nRepublicans via the 'SAC.<br />\nHowever, having SAC status,<br />\nenabling the free use of rooms,<br />\nthe receipt of SAC funds, and the<br />\nright to use the University name,<br />\nalso entails certain obligations.<br />\nNot only must a group include at<br />\na minimum number of undergraduate<br />\nmembers, but it must maintain<br />\naccurate budget and membership<br />\nfigures, all of which are subject<br />\nto the authority of the SAC. If<br />\nsuch groups do not follow these<br />\nrules, then they lose their status<br />\nor face budget cuts. They take no<br />\nfree rides.<br />\nSuch organizations as the New<br />\nPolitical Caucus and the<br />\nConcerned Citizens Against the<br />\nAPL are really only subject to<br />\nthe very loose leash of the<br />\nChaplain's Office, not to the<br />\ncont. on p.<br />\n<br />\nletters to the editorl<br />\nWaiting<br />\n<br />\nTo the Editor:<br />\nHaving read the editorials in<br />\neach of the first four issues of the<br />\nNews-Letter, it appears that<br />\nwhoever is writing them does not<br />\nknow the purpose of an editorial.<br />\nIt is common knowledge that<br />\neditorial are opinions - strictly.<br />\nFacts are presented, and used by<br />\nthe author to express his<br />\nparticular point of view. They<br />\nmay be unfair; they may be<br />\nbiased. They should concern<br />\nissues relevant to students (in the<br />\ncase of the News-Letter). Tuition<br />\nincrease, for example, is not an<br />\nissue. No student wants to pay<br />\nmore, but the administration says<br />\nthey have to charge more. This is<br />\na news story - all facts. No<br />\npurpose is served by<br />\neditorializing on tuition increase.<br />\nBeing somewhat familiar with<br />\n<br />\nstudent activities, I can only<br />\nconclude that the author(s) of<br />\nthis year's News-Letter editorials<br />\neither does not know the real<br />\nissues, is afraid of them or the<br />\nStudent Council, or is simply a<br />\njellyfish that cannot make up its<br />\nmind c) which side of the issues<br />\nto stand.<br />\nI've seen the News-Letter take<br />\na stand with tough, hard-hitting<br />\neditorial Is in previous years, and<br />\nwas amused, aroused, and<br />\nimpressed.

I am<br />\nstrongly opposed to the South<br />\nAfrican government's racial<br />\npolicies. I think that black South<br />\nAfricans should be given a say in<br />\ntheir government along the<br />\nprinciple of one-man one-vote.<br />\nBut why pick on South<br />\nAfrica? South Africa is one of<br />\nthe few democracies in Africa. In<br />\nSouth Africa, 15% of the people<br />\nhave the right to vote and elect<br />\ntheir leaders. In most countries<br />\nof the world today, a handful of<br />\nmen elected by no one make the<br />\ndecisions by which the rest of the<br />\npeople of those countries are<br />\nbound.<br />\nIf we want to sell our stock in<br />\ncompanies doing business with<br />\noppressive governments in Africa,<br />\nperhaps we should consider<br />\nAngola.

We<br />\nare concerned with tapping the<br />\ncreative imagination of the entire<br />\nundergraduate body; primarily in<br />\nstudent-opinion articles, but in<br />\nthe arts as well. Ellipsis prints<br />\ncreative writing of the highest<br />\nquality, which in the past, and<br />\nrightfully so, has primarily come<br />\nfrom graduate students who<br />\nintend to become writers. We will<br />\nprint the work of the Psychology<br />\noi Biology major who writes for<br />\nthe pleasure of writing, as well as<br />\nthe English major whose writing<br />\nmay not match that of graduate<br />\nstudents.<br />\nA similar philosophy governs<br />\nour intention to include<br />\nphotography and graphics. At the<br />\npresent, Johns Hopkins<br />\nUniversity lacks a place for artists<br />\nand photographers to publish<br />\ntheir work. Hopkins must begiti<br />\nto promote creativity and skill on<br />\na continuing basis. Zeniada is<br />\nhe proper<br />\ndevoted to<br />\npresentation of artwork and will<br />\nprovide the necessary amount of<br />\nspace and high quality paper to<br />\nencourage artists to submit.<br />\nOur purposes do not conflict<br />\n<br />\npart of our purpose. He says,<br />\n\"Student opinion on issues of<br />\nnational and international<br />\ninterest -- that is the rightful role<br />\nof such a magazine. No other<br />\nvehicle exists on this campus for<br />\nthe expression of such opinions.\"<br />\nHowever, what the writer seems<br />\nmost concerned about is his<br />\nnotion that by including student<br />\nopinion on local issues and<br />\nUniversity-related feature<br />\narticles, we are infringing upon<br />\nthe rights and territory of the<br />\nNews-Letter itself.<br />\nThis magazine is not and has<br />\nnever been intended to compete<br />\nwith the News-Letter; this idea is<br />\nimplausible, because the primary<br />\npurposes of the publications<br />\ndiffer radically. The News-Letter<br />\nprovides impartial, unbiased<br />\nreports on news events that the<br />\nHopkins community has a right<br />\nand need to know about. Its<br />\nstudent-opinion articles center on<br />\ncontroversial topics \"here at the<br />\nUniversity,\" as the writer himself<br />\nadmits. He praises our intent to<br />\n\"publish student opinion on<br />\nnational and international issues.<br />\nIf the student is inclined to<br />\nsubmit occasional local and<br />\nUniversity-related articles to<br />\nZeniada, why should the<br />\nmagazine refuse to publish them?<br />\nFurthermore, the News-Letter<br />\nsimply cannot devote enough<br />\nspace to publish the amount of<br />\nstudent opinion to which we are<br />\ncommitted without cutting down<br />\non its straight news content.<br />\nStudent opinion is our primary<br />\nconcern.<br />\nThe writer also takes it upon<br />\nhimself to object, on behalf of<br />\n<br />\nDe Broca's<br />\nCrowning<br />\nTriumph!<br />\n<br />\nwith those of any current student<br />\npublication. Why should we try<br />\nto combine or divide our efforts<br />\nin order to expand another<br />\nmagazine with its own staff and<br />\nits own purposes?<br />\nThe whole objection of this<br />\neditorial to Zeniada is that we<br />\noverlap Ellipsis and the<br />\nNews-Letter in some areas.

A<br />\nmember of the Hopkins faculty for nearly twenty<br />\nyears, Mr. Arellano ranks as one of the most<br />\npopular and well-liked teachers at the University.<br />\nHis courses in Playwriting are usually filled during<br />\nthe preregistration period, and often the<br />\nunfortunate students who get left out must be<br />\nput on a waiting list.<br />\nThe most distinct feature of the Playwriting<br />\ncourse, besides Mr. Arellano's open and relaxed<br />\nstyle, is the production night, when the best of<br />\nthe class's plays are performed in the Little<br />\nTheatre during finals week. How many professors<br />\nat Hopkins can brag that over 100 people come<br />\nto watch their final exams and make an enjoyable<br />\nevening out of it at that?<br />\nI talked with Mr. Arellano earlier this week in<br />\nthe office of John Barth, a well-known novelist.<br />\nMr. Barth was not present during the interview.<br />\nLet's start at the beginning: when and where<br />\nyou were born.<br />\n<br />\nwas born in Havana, Cuba . Miny years ago.<br />\n(Laughs)<br />\nWhat was it like growing up in Cuba?<br />\nThe rich were very rich and the poor were<br />\nvery po6r We had ten or eleven servants. You had<br />\nsomebody to mow the lawn, and you had a<br />\nchauffeur, and a chauffeur needed a helper. And<br />\nyou had a cook and the cook needed a helper.<br />\nAnd you had maids. This was the old-style social<br />\norder, which was very unjust.<br />\nWhen and why did you come to the United<br />\nStates?<br />\nWell, I was very much pro-Castro in the<br />\nbeginning, and very much against Baptista, who<br />\nwas the dictator before Castro. So when Castro<br />\ntook over, I was very happy about that, for about<br />\nsix months. Then he kicked out the presidents<br />\nand he took over the whole island, the whole<br />\ngovernment, 2.,id then I got very unhappy about<br />\nit and decided to leave Cuba and come to the<br />\nUnited _States. I realized Castro was trying to<br />\nturn Cuba into a Communist state, which he did.<br />\nSo I left, and then I started going to MIT.<br />\nWhere did you get your various degrees<br />\nfrom?<br />\nI got my masters degree in chemistry at<br />\nMIT. Then I came up to Baltimore and started<br />\nworking here with Dr. Orwin who used to run the<br />\norganic chemistry course. I was doing research for<br />\nhim. Then I always wanted to write, so in my<br />\nspare time I took writing seminars courses here<br />\nand eventually I got a masters degree from the<br />\nWriting Seminars at Hopkins.<br />\nDid you go straight into teaching after<br />\ngraduating from MIT?<br />\nAfter finishing at MIT; I went back to<br />\nCuba. My father had his own business, so I started<br />\nworking with him. He used to represent American<br />\nMotors in Cuba, which was a very nice<br />\narrangement that we had. Of course, Castro then<br />\ntook over the whole thing.<br />\n<br />\nHow did you become interested in<br />\nchemistry, and then writing?<br />\nChemistry was my first love, I think. In<br />\nhigh school in Cuba, I had a very good chemistry<br />\nteacher. i got interested in chemistry and when I<br />\ngraduated from high school, I applied tog.MIT,and went there for five years.<br />\nIt was after I graduated from college and went<br />\nback to Cuba to work with my father that I<br />\nstarted writing short stories. When I came here to<br />\nHopkins and I saw they had the Writing Seminars,<br />\nI realized that was an ideal opportunity for me to<br />\ntake some courses, which I did. Eventually I took<br />\nenough courses so that I got a degree.<br />\nDo you think a writer should have another<br />\nvocation, in addition to being a writer, in order to<br />\nstay in the mainstream of life, so to speak?<br />\n<br />\nALL IN THE FAMILY or MASH?<br />\nI don't see much that's impressive. Not very<br />\nmuch. The British have done a good job, much<br />\nbetter than we have. Situation comedy is<br />\noverdone on TV. But sure, if you want to waste<br />\nan hour or two, go ahead. (Laughs) Sometimes<br />\nit's alright. You might want to read a detective<br />\nnovel, or science fiction. Something you don't<br />\nhave to think about.<br />\nHow did the playwriting class evolve?<br />\n<br />\nst<br />\nSt<br />\n<br />\nJACK OF TVV1<br />\n<br />\nIt really depends on the writer. It has<br />\nworked for me, and I've enjoyed working in both<br />\nfields. Not every writer has this \"schizophrenic\"<br />\nset-up like I do, chemistry and writing. But<br />\nwhat's worked for me might not work for other<br />\npeople.<br />\nHow many of your plays have been<br />\nproduced?<br />\nSeveral of my plays have been produced<br />\nlocally. Corner Theatre produced two of them.<br />\nTowson State University produced two. Here at<br />\nHopkins one of my plays was produced last year,<br />\nand three or four years ago also.<br />\nstarted writing short stories, but they had<br />\nmore dialogue than description, so eventually I<br />\nthought, if I'm writing so much dialogue, why<br />\nnot write a play? So I started writing plays.<br />\nHow does a writer get his plays produced?<br />\nYou have to go to New York. You write to<br />\nagents and tell them what you have. You send<br />\nthem the play, they look it over, and decide<br />\nwhether its's producible or not, whether or not<br />\nit's going to make any money.<br />\nDo you do any other kind of writing<br />\nbesides plays?<br />\nRight now only plays. I've given up on<br />\nshort stories. I like playwriting more than writing<br />\nfiction. I tried poetry years ago, but I gave it up.<br />\nIt's just not my field.<br />\nWas any of your creative writing ever<br />\npublished?<br />\nI wrote a story once, and I sold it to a<br />\nbrand new magazine. After the first issue, I got a<br />\nletter from the editor saying that my story would<br />\nbe printed in the second issue. But the magazine<br />\ncollapsed after the first issue. (Laughs) But, they<br />\npaid me for it.<br />\nHow many chemistry papers have you<br />\npublished?<br />\nI've had four published, in the Journal of<br />\nOrganic Chemistry.<br />\nWhat's your opinion ofcontemporary drama?<br />\nWell, I'm really a fanatic about Albee. But<br />\nnot<br />\nvery much a fan of the Theatre of the<br />\nI'm<br />\nAbsurd, you know, Pinter, people like that. I do<br />\nlike some of it though. Pinter's Old Times I<br />\nenjoyed very much. I like David Storey, Tom<br />\nStoppard.<br />\nWho are your favorite fiction writers?<br />\nI don't do much reading in fiction. Lately<br />\nI've been reading some of the Latin American<br />\nwriters, like Garcia Marquez and Borges. I've just<br />\ndiscovered them because I was neglecting most of<br />\nwhat was being written in Spanish.<br />\nI've read a lot of Barth. I read all of the books<br />\nthat we teach in American contemporary letters.<br />\nIs that where _Your taste in literature usually<br />\nruns?<br />\nWell, I would't say that. I read them all,<br />\nand some of them I enjoy very much. But<br />\ngenerally, my favorites are the Latin American<br />\nwriters.<br />\nDo you think any good drama is being done<br />\n. r instance, on some of.the sq-coms like<br />\non TV, Jo<br />\n<br />\nd,<br />\ntl<br />\n<br />\nby Patrick E<br />\n<br />\nI guess it came out of the unrest of the late<br />\nsixties and early seventies. As a matter of fact,<br />\nwhen the class started, it was called PROBLEM<br />\nDRAMA.<br />\nWhose problem was it?<br />\nOh, the problems of the University, remember<br />\nthose days, there was a question of audxrity who<br />\nshould decide things. There was a lot of upheaval,<br />\nalthough Hopkins wasn't that bad. It was<br />\ngenerally very quiet. But there was a group of<br />\nstudents who were interested in drama, so I<br />\noffered to teach a course in it. Most of the plays<br />\nthat were written were about the Vietnam War,<br />\nsituations in the University. That's how it started<br />\nand that's why it was called PROBLEM DRAMA.<br />\nAt first it was not a credited course. Eventually,<br />\nstudents wanted to know if it was a credited<br />\ncourse because they were putting a lot of time<br />\ninto it. I asked Elliot Coleman, chairman of the<br />\nWriting Seminars at the time, and he said yes.<br />\nWe went to the Dean, and he said yes. This was in<br />\n<br />\nsti<br />\ncl<br />\nIc<br />\nan<br />\nve<br />\nin<br />\nto<br />\nAi<br />\nju<br />\nI<br />\nth<br />\n<br />\nc(<br />\n<br />\ny(<br />\n<br />\n'71<br />\n<br />\nBut the class has changed completely, just as<br />\n<br />\npi<br />\n<br />\n\fWO TRADES<br />\n<br />\nick Eacolano<br />\n<br />\nThat's hard to answer because I enjoy both.<br />\nIt's refreshing to change from one to the other.<br />\nOne provides relief from the other.<br />\nHow long have you been teaching?<br />\nI've been here at Hopkins since 1959. How have the students changed since then?<br />\nThe youth of today is being compared to the<br />\nyouth of the 50's. Do you see that?<br />\nOf, definitely. When I first came here, the<br />\nstudents were very much like the students of my<br />\ncollege days, you know, carefree. They just<br />\nworried about their studies, and dating, and their<br />\ngirl friends. Then came the sixties, and that was<br />\nan unprecedented thing as far as I know; students<br />\nrebelling, getting involved in politics, and fighting<br />\nthe University. This lasted a few years, then it<br />\nsubsided again back to the student who cares<br />\nonly about his work and his girl friend.<br />\nI don't know how to explain what happened in<br />\nthe universities during the later sixties and early<br />\nseventies. I supported the students, I was very<br />\nmuch against the Vietnam War. A lot of things<br />\nhave changed because of it. We<br />\nnow have<br />\nstudent trustees, and I think the Administration<br />\nnowadays pays a lot more attention to the<br />\nstudents than it did ten years ago. And I think<br />\nthis is a result of the sixties. Now everything that<br />\nhappened then was good. Burning down buildings<br />\nand putting bombs in buildings is definitely not<br />\ngood. But the students had a reasonable gripe.<br />\nNobody was paying any attention to them. Now<br />\nthe Administration does pay attention to them.<br />\nHave you ever considered teaching<br />\nsomewhere other than Hopkins?<br />\n..Not seriously, no.<br />\nI haven't looked. I've<br />\nenjoyed my stay at Hopkins over the years. I<br />\nwouldn't consider going anywhere else right now.<br />\n<br />\nplay writing?<br />\n<br />\nare.<br />\n<br />\nilustration b<br />\n<br />\nAnother thing that's helped a lot is that people<br />\ncome to see the plays, and they think, \"Wow, if<br />\nmy roommate can do it, then so can I.\" It's<br />\nword-of-mouth, mostly.<br />\nHas any famous playwright come out of<br />\nyour class yet?<br />\nNo, not yet.(Laughs) But I'm hoping.<br />\nWhich do you enjoy more, chemistry or<br />\n<br />\nAre yoii conscious of any hostility between<br />\nthe Writing Seminars and the English<br />\ndepartments?<br />\nOh, definitely not. We even share<br />\nprofessors.<br />\nNoted sage Cates Baldridge has said that, Writirw<br />\nSeminarsIN ,;pk,think that, writing began with Joyce while<br />\nEnglish department people think that it ended<br />\nwith Joyce.<br />\nIt may be true that there are differences of<br />\nopinion, but I don't know of any specific<br />\ninstance of violent disagreement. We collaborate<br />\nvery much.<br />\nDo you think that Hopkins professors place<br />\ntoo much emphasis on research and not enough<br />\non their classes and students?<br />\nWell, unfortunately, that's part of the<br />\nsystem. You hire a professor usually on the basis<br />\nof his publications. In some of the departments<br />\nhere--I won't say which--the emphasis is on<br />\nresearch and publishing,and not so much on<br />\nteaching. That's not just at Hopkins. That's at<br />\nevery university. I think more emphasis should be<br />\nput on teaching, especially at the undergraduate<br />\nlevel. The contact between a faculty member and<br />\nhis student is almost nil at times. For instance, in<br />\nchemistry we have 300 students in one class. It's<br />\nimpossible to get acquainted with all those<br />\nstudents, to have any kind of social relationship<br />\nwith all of them. You hardly get to know their<br />\nnames. In the Writing Seminars, it's much better<br />\nbecause the classes are limited to fifteen students<br />\nas a rule, because they're mostly seminars and<br />\nworkshops.<br />\nDo you think the undergraduate at Hopkins<br />\nis overlooked in favor of the graduate student?<br />\nThat depends on the department. The<br />\ngraduate does research for a professor, and he<br />\ndoes research much better than an undergraduate.<br />\nSo it's natural for a professor to want graduate<br />\nstudents working for him because that means<br />\nhe'll be able to publish more. This is a<br />\nresearch-oriented institution. Most universities<br />\n<br />\n'Why do you think the course is so popular?<br />\nIt's a different course from what every<br />\nstudent has to take at the University. As I say in<br />\nclass, we're not looking at your intelligence, your<br />\nIQ, how well you do in exams. We're looking at<br />\nan aspect which the University doesn't explore<br />\nvery much, and that's the emotional part of any<br />\nindividual. I'm interested in how well you're able<br />\nto communicate your feelings, your emotions.<br />\nAnd I think it's refreshing. You know, man is not<br />\njust intelligence. Man has his emotional side. And<br />\nthink that's one reason why people like to take<br />\nthe playwriting course.<br />\n<br />\nWhat do you think of the system of having<br />\n\"teaching assistants\"for undergrads?<br />\nI think it works. The University applied for<br />\na grant from the Kenan Foundation two years<br />\nago. They gave Hopkins $750,000 to improve<br />\nundergraduate education. I got S3000 the first<br />\nyear, and S2000 the sectnd year. Since I'm so<br />\nconcerned with T.A.'s, I felt that we were missing<br />\nsomething. Look at most T.A.'s. Last year they<br />\nwere seniors at college, right? This year they get<br />\nadmitted here, they get their stipends, and all of a,<br />\nsudden they're teachers! That's why/ I applied for<br />\nthis Kenan Foundation grant. I said, I want to<br />\nbring the T.A.'s here a week ahead of time, get a<br />\nfew T.A.'s from last year, and get them to teach<br />\nthese new T.A.'s how to teach. So these<br />\nprospective T.A.'s conic here a week ahead of<br />\ntime, they have meetings in the morning and<br />\nafternoon, and go over all the books they're going<br />\nto be teaching. Then they each take a book and<br />\npresent it to the other T.A.'s, as if they were<br />\nteaching a class. I've done this for the last two<br />\nyears, and I've done this with the chemistry<br />\nT.A.'s also. They come in, also a week ahead of<br />\ntime, and go over all the experiments they're<br />\ngoing to teach the freshmen. I think this has<br />\nworked very well for both departments.<br />\n<br />\nHow true is \"publish or perish?\"<br />\nI think it's true at every university. The<br />\nemphasis is on publishing, no doubt about that.<br />\nNot enough emphasis is placed on teaching, but<br />\nthat's not to say we don't have any good<br />\nteachers 'hciTe, because we do. But it's hard to be a<br />\ngood teacher and a good researcher at the same<br />\ntime.<br />\n<br />\nIs the world of the university any less real<br />\nthan the world that exists outside the boundaries<br />\nof the campus?<br />\nI don't want to call the years you spend in<br />\ncollege,\"unreal,\" because they're not unreal. The<br />\nfour years- are like a retreat, where you try to<br />\nprepare yourself for the rest of your life. I<br />\nwouldn't call that \"unreal.\"<br />\nIt's a kind of womb-like existence. That's why<br />\nI call it a retreat. It's like the philosopher who<br />\ngoes into the desert for two or three weeks just<br />\nthinking and trying to elaborate on his thoughts<br />\nand ideas and his future. It's a period of<br />\nlearning--and I don't just mean learning more<br />\nchemistry or more history ar more English.<br />\nYou're learning about yourself. This is why I<br />\ndon't think it's \"unreal.\" For instance, I've had<br />\nmany students who decide to drop out of<br />\npre-med. They start to think, \"Well, maybe I'm<br />\ndoing this because my father wants me to be a<br />\ndoctor. But I really like literature a lot, so maybe<br />\nI should be in the English department.\" You're<br />\nlearning about yourself. Is college womb-like?<br />\nYes. But it's a necessary thing, I think. To find<br />\nout about yourself, you have to escape from the<br />\nworld for a while to think.<br />\n<br />\nphotos by John Gunn<br />\n<br />\nthe students have changed. People weren't<br />\ndemanding things from the University as much as<br />\nthey were in the past, so the students just started<br />\nwriting plays.<br />\nHow many students have taken the course<br />\nover the years?<br />\nYou figure about 25 to 30 each semester,<br />\nplus about 15 each intersession, then there's<br />\nsummer school, but they're not Hopkins<br />\nstudents. We put on about 60 plays a year.<br />\n<br />\n\fPAGE 14 I OCTOBER 6,1978<br />\n<br />\nFor a good time, call<br />\n<br />\nThree Six Six - Five Oh Seven Six<br />\nand ask for<br />\nI have always considered myself something of a rebel.'<br />\nFearless. Uninhibited. Not afraid to deviate from the<br />\nnorm. So when I moved into a new apartment this fall, I<br />\ndecided to wait awhile before installing a phone.<br />\nThis may not strike you as being a particularly radical<br />\nact. To be perfectly honest, I didn't think much of it at<br />\nthe time. Now, barely a month later, I marvel at my own<br />\ninnocence. For by not immediately rushing out and<br />\ngetting myself plugged in, I found myself gradually being<br />\nlabelled a misanthrope. Uncommunicative. Unwilling to<br />\nshare my life with the community at large.<br />\nThe first signs of an establishment reaction came,<br />\npredictably, from my mother. At .first, she was patient.<br />\n(\"Well, just let us know when you get one,\" she'd sigh.)<br />\nLater, she became restless. (\"When are you going to get a<br />\nphone?\") Still later, self-righteous indignation began to<br />\nset in. (\"Oh, Billy! You mean to say you still haven't got<br />\none?\") Finally, my delay in getting a phone became a<br />\npersonal rejection. \"I think you're deliberately not getting<br />\na phone. so I can't talk to you,\" the argument went. This<br />\nlast accusation seemed to me to be on the verge of<br />\nparanoid hysteria -- but after all, moms are like that.<br />\nThen my girlfriend started getting into the act. \"You're<br />\ntrying to avoid me,\" she said. \"Why don't you want to<br />\nspeak to me?\" I, don't need to tell you it was only a<br />\nmatter of time before these complaints were translated<br />\ninto,\"you don't love me.\"<br />\nThis was a little disturbing, but I still thought I might<br />\nbe able to stick it out. After all, I was independent. Why<br />\nshould I get a phone just to satisfy the whims of a couple<br />\nof insecure, overpossessive females?<br />\nBut I was still operating under the delusion that society<br />\nwould actually permit me to exist without a phone. After<br />\nall. sonic of my relatives had come pretty close. My<br />\ngreat-aunt and uncle have a cabin in Maine where they<br />\ndon't like to be disturbed. However, they feel they have<br />\ntoo many friends not to have a phone. Their solution was<br />\nto install a phone on the trunk of a tree some 200 yards<br />\naway from the cabin. If they want to call out, they can do<br />\nso simply by taking a short hike. And if they happen to<br />\nbe walking by the tree while the phone is ringing, they<br />\nanswer it.(This happens about once or twice a year.)<br />\nBut Maine ain't Baltimore, and my great-aunt and uncle<br />\n<br />\nBill Newlin<br />\ndon't go to Hopkins. If they did, they wouldn't be able to<br />\nhold out for more than a month.<br />\nPerhaps the reason phones are such a necessity here is<br />\nthat during freshman year (when you really don't need a<br />\nphone) everyone gets into the habit of seeing their friends<br />\nall the time. Then, when the Housing Office takes away<br />\nour lollipops and kicks us out into the big, wide,<br />\nAll-America city, we want to keep up the close contact<br />\n<br />\nIllustration by Lisa Kay Pease<br />\nwe established during that first idyllic (?) year.<br />\nMaybe it's just a contagious disease.<br />\nBut whatever the reason, Hopkins students (and<br />\nprobably students in general) place an unusual degree of<br />\nemphasis on phones.<br />\nIt wasn't so bad at first, not having a phone. In fact,<br />\nmost people acted very solicitous towards me, as if they<br />\n<br />\nunderstood it could happen to anyone. Sympathetic faces<br />\ntold me they, too, were having trouble starting a new<br />\nsemester -- perhaps I hadn't found an apartment yet, or<br />\nwas having trouble making an appointment.<br />\nMy days of grace, however, were shortlived. These same<br />\npeople, when told a week later I still didn't have a phone,<br />\nacted sullen, bitter and resentful. Strangers asking for my<br />\nnumber would smile quizzically when I refused them,<br />\nthen turn abruptly on their heels, muttering under their<br />\nbreaths.<br />\nAnd it didn't stop there. Things went rapidly from bad<br />\nto worse. Old friends began stopping me on the street just<br />\nto ask me whether I'd gotten a phone. Others just stopped<br />\nspeaking to me altogether. The bank threatened to stop<br />\ncashing my checks. As for me, I began to suffer from an<br />\nidentity crisis.<br />\nFinally, I couldn't take it any longer. My experiment in<br />\nfree living was a colossal failure. During a month of living<br />\nwithout the benefit of a seven-digit number I was<br />\nquestioned, cross-questioned, cajoled, implored and,<br />\nfinally, threatened. I fell victim to more institutional<br />\npressure than a Soviet dissident. In the end, I discovered<br />\nHopkins is not a free community. You can cut classes.<br />\nYou can take drugs. You can even go to the Rat wearing<br />\nnothing but a jock and a bra. But you can't not have a<br />\nphone.<br />\nYesterday I took the final, irrevocable step<br />\n(incidentally, the first thing C&P asked me when I told<br />\nthem I wanted a new phone was, \"What's your phone<br />\nnumber, sir?\"). It's sitting on my desk now, black and<br />\nugly, leering at me. Pretty soon the damn thing is going to<br />\nstart ringing. And since I figure you bastards are going to<br />\nget ahold of my phone number anyway and start calling<br />\nme up at 6 am when I didn't get to sleep until four asking<br />\nme whether you can copy my history notes, I decided to<br />\ngo out in style. That's why I've plastered my new number<br />\nacross the top of this page.<br />\nThere it is, Hopkins: 366-5076. Add it up and you get<br />\n33.

There still are no clues to where the missing<br />\ntreasures might be. The university, in fact, is now saying<br />\nneither the etchings nor the book were ever actually at<br />\nthe school.<br />\nNevertheless Bird and Grant are upset that the school<br />\nhad \"item': worth thousands of dollars and didn't bother<br />\nto maintain a proper inventory\" in the first place. They're<br />\nalso questioning some other UT purchases. High on their<br />\nlist are the $50,000 to build a golf course and three duck<br />\nponds at the university's Permian Basin campus, and the<br />\npublic monies used for shipping four swans from Michigan<br />\nto populate the ponds.<br />\nGrant's major hope now is that someone from the<br />\nuniversity doesn't forget to pick up the award.<br />\n<br />\n(CPS) King's College wants its old campus back.<br />\nTrouble is. its old campus happens to be what is now<br />\nknown as Columbia University in New York. And if<br />\nKing's can't get its campus back, the small Nova Scotia<br />\nschool wants a relatively modest $50 million settlement.<br />\nIt seems Columbia was originally chartered by King<br />\nGeorge II as King's College back in 1754. King's was to be<br />\n\"an Anglican institution\" in perpetuity, and Anglicans<br />\nraised most of the school's original endowment.<br />\n<br />\nBut during the American Revolution the school's land<br />\nwas seized, and ifs name was changed to Columbia. The<br />\ncollege-less Anglicans got another charter, bought some<br />\nland in Nova Scotia, and started a new school called<br />\nKing's College.<br />\nYet they haven't forgotten. King's College President<br />\nJohn Godfrey has now asked Columbia President William<br />\nGill to pay up. Godfrey says he's willing to settle for a<br />\nmodest $50 million. If Gill refuses - and he already has Godfrey says he'll just take the campus back.<br />\n\"We are amused,\" a Columbia spokesman told the<br />\nChronicle ofHigher Education.<br />\n<br />\n\"keen\".<br />\nThe same goes for flight attendants and historians.<br />\nThe handbook counsels lawyers that they should look<br />\nfor jobs in the heartland.

Play ended in a<br />\nscoreless first half tally, but<br />\nKutztown came back in the<br />\nsecond half to take advantage of<br />\nHopkins defensive holes and<br />\npump in two goals past net<br />\ntender Kenny Suesse.<br />\nIn Saturday's game against<br />\nUrsinus. the Jays played solidly<br />\n<br />\nand impressively in contrast to<br />\nWednesday's disappointing loss.<br />\nThis was due, in large measure, to<br />\nthe stunning individual<br />\nperformance of Senior Lee<br />\nFriant, who scored both<br />\nHopkins' goals by racing ahead of<br />\nhis defender and kicking the ball<br />\nin past the Ursinus goal tender.<br />\nAlthough play was rough, with<br />\nfive Hopkins kickers injured in<br />\nvarious stages of the game, the<br />\nreferee took no action until late<br />\nin the second half, when an<br />\nUrsinus lineman was issued a<br />\nwarning and another was<br />\nexpelled from the game.<br />\nThroughout the game, the Jays<br />\nplayed brilliantly on the attack,<br />\nby cutting in and forging past<br />\nawaiting Ursinus defenders. Lee<br />\nFriant, aided by Bobby Teasdall,<br />\nMarty Wolf and Chaim Levin<br />\nsucceeded in taking advantage of<br />\nUrsinus' weak defense by<br />\nbreaking away and driving down<br />\nfield toward the opponent's goal.<br />\nThe Jay defense, composed of<br />\nSeniors Kenny Suisse, Steve<br />\nGalloway, Sophomore Mike<br />\n<br />\nDIXIE<br />\n<br />\nAfter taking it on the chin last<br />\nweek, Dixie Dick threw up his<br />\nhands in despair and sighed,<br />\n\"Any male chimpanzee over the<br />\nage of 13 could outpick Dixie<br />\nDick's picks!\" As a result of this<br />\nrare moment of weakness, we<br />\nwere forced to contact the<br />\nDurham kingpin Big Jim, Dixie<br />\nDick's pal who rules the rackets<br />\ndown in Carolina country.

The JHU women<br />\ndominated the Georgetown team,<br />\nallowing only three shots against<br />\nrookie goalie Lynn Katz.<br />\nHowever, the next game was a<br />\nless dazzling performance, as the<br />\nteam was beaten by a<br />\nbetter-trained Franklin and<br />\nMarshall team on F&M's own<br />\nfield. Coach Morse admitted .that<br />\nHopkins had never played on a<br />\nfield that was so well trimmed.<br />\nShe said her team was \"just<br />\noutplayed.\"<br />\nThe third game of the season<br />\nwent well throughout the first<br />\nhalf, and the game remained<br />\nscoreless at halftime. But the first<br />\nfive minutes of the second half<br />\nsaw Dickinson score while<br />\nstopping the JHU offense cold<br />\nfor the rest of the contest. The<br />\ngame ended in a 2-0 defeat, a<br />\nperformance that could best be<br />\ndescribed as lack-ruster. Said<br />\nCoach Morse, \"The girls weren't<br />\nplaying with their hearts in the<br />\ngame.

At<br />\nHopkins, the Library's primary<br />\nemphasis is on the individual<br /><br />\nresearch needs of the Arts and<br />\nSciences faculty \"regardless of<br />\nthe permanent usefulness of<br />\nthose materials, regardless of.the<br />\nneed for comprehensive growth<br />\nof these collections, and<br />\nregardless of the changing<br />\nstrengths and weaknesses of the<br />\nacademic program.\"<br />\nNew departments, such as<br />\nAnthropology are very costly in<br />\nterms of additional resources,<br />\nand Stall, thinks the Library<br />\ncould not adapt to many more<br />\nsuch additions. (Currently, the<br />\nLibrary can not even afford to<br />\npurchase many scholarly works<br />\nproduced within the university<br />\nitself) The Library also feels<br />\npressure from the wide range of<br />\nEvening College courses. Stain<br />\nbelieves that the solution to these<br />\nconflicting demands lies in<br />\n\"shared resources,\" rather than<br />\nself-sufficiency. He foresees more<br />\nmicrofilm and collection<br />\ndistributing throughout various<br />\nuniversity and area libraries.

But in the careers<br />\nprogram sponsored this week by the Student Council,<br />\nundergraduates here demonstrated that the average Hoppie<br />\nis not willing to be stimulated.<br />\nThe forum this week brought some scintillating people<br />\nfrom the Baltimore area on campus to meet students. In the<br />\nmedia field alone, alumni such as Michael Hill, T.V.<br />\ncolumnist for the Evening Sun, and Bill Tanton, the veteran<br />\nsports editor for the same paper, were fascinating. The<br />\nevent presented a rare opportunity for conversing with<br />\nthem informally. Equally interesting individuals appeared in<br />\nmost of the other \"career fields\".<br />\nBut Hopkins students proved themselves unwilling to<br />\nleave their pompous posteriors. Only about 40 people at<br />\nmost made it to each of the three sessions this week, a<br />\npitifully poor performance. Granted, the Council's<br />\nadvertising for the forum foolishly focused on free food<br />\nmore than on the guests scheduled to appear. But the<br />\nundergraduate response was clear enough. They aren't<br />\ninterested in career counseling. They think the path to<br />\nsuccess is simple enough -- just go to med school, or law<br />\nschool, or grad school a\u2014cln the job, the career, the life will<br />\nbe out there waiting for them. That outlook is an illusion.<br />\nMost Hoppies will leave the University shelter soon enough<br />\nfor the storm and struggle of the seal world. For a meager<br />\nfew, the forum was a good preview.<br /><br />\nLibrary Crisis<br />\nDavid Stam's report on the condition of the M.S.E.<br />\nLibrary was surprising, but not really shocking to people<br />\nwho arc familiar with the situation. The administration<br />\ndevotes little effort to solving the library's problems. Yet<br />\nthe University dedicates itself to new engineering schools<br />\nand biology buildings. This shows an intolerable neglect for<br />\nliberal education.<br />\nPresident Muller piously professes to believe that the<br />\nhumanities at Hopkins are among the ,strongest in the<br />\nnation, and that they are growing even stronger. But in the<br />\nnext breath he says they are cheaper to maintain because,<br />\nunlike the sciences, they require no constant technical<br />\nmodernization.<br />\nThe current library crisis underscores the fallacy in this<br />\nclaim. The most important work in just about every field of<br />\nstudy is going on now. To be the best, a University must<br />\nhave available the most recent research in every field. This<br />\nrequires an active, ever-growing library. For the M.S.E.<br />\nLibrary to remain static is to sink it into the mire of<br />\nmediocrity. And it will take the whole University with it.<br /><br />\n.1111.<br />\n\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022<br /><br />\nay.<br /><br />\nI -101-/, ./.<br /><br />\nArr<br /><br />\nMisuse Of Hopkins Name Must End<br />\nBY DAN WILE<br />\nMorality is a peculiar concept.<br />\nAlthough it is nearly impossible<br />\nto either fully define or practice,<br />\nit is often used as the<br />\njustification for actions trivial<br />\nand substantial, kind and bestial.<br />\nProfessor Hans Morgenthau<br />\nwrote thirty years age that our<br />\nLiberal heritage refuses to<br />\nacknowledge that frequent<br />\nnecessity of adopting amoral<br />\ntactics in pursuit of what are<br />\nconceived as moral goals in<br />\nforeign affairs. Thus the morality<br />\nargument is gooily and<br />\ndestructively seductive, rather<br />\nlike the honeydew plant that<br />\nlures insects to its fatally sticky<br />\ntentacles. In our culture, the<br />\nperson who appears to embody<br />\nmorality in effect possesses a<br />\nspecial and potentially abusive<br />\npower, either intentional or<br />\nunintentional. -Such is the case<br />\nwith the Chaplain's Office, and<br />\nthat is why it should stay as far<br />\naway from politics as possible<br />\n(i.e., it ought to stop<br />\nco-sponsoring rallies or forums<br />\nby such groups as NORML, the<br />\nConcerned Citizens Against the<br />\nAPL, and the New Political<br />\nCaucus).<br />\nThe political activities of the<br />\nChaplain's Office are especially<br />\ntroubling given its special<br />\nposition within the University.<br />\nSince JHU contains students of<br />\nmany faiths, the Office is quite<br />\nproperly nonsectarian. But, if it<br />\ncannot spread the Gospel, what<br /><br />\nI<br /><br />\ncan it do? In a school where<br />\nstudents compete rapaciously for<br />\ngrades, bedpartners, and fame'n'<br />\nfortune, the Office should<br />\nentourage people to think about<br />\nspiritual issues, and it should<br />\npromote the welfare of our<br />\nfellow man. Most churches of the<br />\nworld engage in these good<br />\nworks. The Chaplain's Office<br />\nfulfills these duties to a certain<br />\nextent through its Criminal<br />\nJustice and Tutoring programs, as<br />\nwell as in the Sunday Experience.<br />\nIt raises money for these<br />\nactivities through providing such<br />\nservices as auctions, coffee<br />\nhouses and film screenings.<br />\nHowever, the Chaplain's Office<br />\nis also part of the University<br />\nbureaucracy. University funds<br />\nhelp support it, and it is entitled<br />\nto use the University name in all<br />\nof its activities. In effect,<br />\nwhatever it does carries the<br />\nindirect sanction of the<br />\nUniversity and the financial<br />\nsources that support JHU.<br />\nFurthermore, the Chaplain<br />\nappears at such official functions<br />\nas Commencement and<br />\nCommencement Day. The Office<br />\nhas a double legitimacy created<br />\nby its tics to the University and<br />\nto God.<br />\nhereini lies the danger of<br />\npolitical involvement. Many<br />\ngroups whose meetings are<br />\nco-sponsored by the Chaplain's<br />\nOffice are apparently composed<br />\nlargely of outsiders, with but a<br />\nfew undergraduates as members,<br />\nand such organizations are not'<br /><br />\nmembers of the Student<br />\nActivities Commission. It is only<br />\nthe affiliation with the Chaplain's<br />\nOffice that permits them to use<br />\nUniversity facilities free of<br />\ncharge. The Office's link with the<br />\nAdministration means that the<br />\nUniversity and money givers are<br />\ntacitly supporting both<br />\nnon-University activities and<br />\npolitical views of which they may<br />\nvery well not approve. That the<br />\nChaplain's Office serves as the<br />\nagent for this acceptance<br />\nprovides the necessary moral<br />\nsalve.<br />\nSome will argue that the<br />\nUniversity subsidizes such<br />\npolitical groups as the Young<br />\nDemocrats and the College<br />\nRepublicans via the 'SAC.<br />\nHowever, having SAC status,<br />\nenabling the free use of rooms,<br />\nthe receipt of SAC funds, and the<br />\nright to use the University name,<br />\nalso entails certain obligations.<br />\nNot only must a group include at<br />\na minimum number of undergraduate<br />\nmembers, but it must maintain<br />\naccurate budget and membership<br />\nfigures, all of which are subject<br />\nto the authority of the SAC. If<br />\nsuch groups do not follow these<br />\nrules, then they lose their status<br />\nor face budget cuts. They take no<br />\nfree rides.<br />\nSuch organizations as the New<br />\nPolitical Caucus and the<br />\nConcerned Citizens Against the<br />\nAPL are really only subject to<br />\nthe very loose leash of the<br />\nChaplain's Office, not to the<br />\ncont. on p.<br /><br />\nletters to the editorl<br />\nWaiting<br /><br />\nTo the Editor:<br />\nHaving read the editorials in<br />\neach of the first four issues of the<br />\nNews-Letter, it appears that<br />\nwhoever is writing them does not<br />\nknow the purpose of an editorial.<br />\nIt is common knowledge that<br />\neditorial are opinions - strictly.<br />\nFacts are presented, and used by<br />\nthe author to express his<br />\nparticular point of view. They<br />\nmay be unfair; they may be<br />\nbiased. They should concern<br />\nissues relevant to students (in the<br />\ncase of the News-Letter). Tuition<br />\nincrease, for example, is not an<br />\nissue. No student wants to pay<br />\nmore, but the administration says<br />\nthey have to charge more. This is<br />\na news story - all facts. No<br />\npurpose is served by<br />\neditorializing on tuition increase.<br />\nBeing somewhat familiar with<br /><br />\nstudent activities, I can only<br />\nconclude that the author(s) of<br />\nthis year's News-Letter editorials<br />\neither does not know the real<br />\nissues, is afraid of them or the<br />\nStudent Council, or is simply a<br />\njellyfish that cannot make up its<br />\nmind c) which side of the issues<br />\nto stand.<br />\nI've seen the News-Letter take<br />\na stand with tough, hard-hitting<br />\neditorial Is in previous years, and<br />\nwas amused, aroused, and<br />\nimpressed. So far this year, I'm<br />\nstill waiting.<br />\nSincerely<br />\nName Withheld<br />\nClass of'79<br /><br />\nWhy Beef?<br />\nTo the Editor:<br />\nSome members of the student<br />\nbody are calling for the<br /><br />\nuniversity to sell its holdings of<br />\nstocks in companies that do<br />\nbusiness in South Africa. I am<br />\nstrongly opposed to the South<br />\nAfrican government's racial<br />\npolicies. I think that black South<br />\nAfricans should be given a say in<br />\ntheir government along the<br />\nprinciple of one-man one-vote.<br />\nBut why pick on South<br />\nAfrica? South Africa is one of<br />\nthe few democracies in Africa. In<br />\nSouth Africa, 15% of the people<br />\nhave the right to vote and elect<br />\ntheir leaders. In most countries<br />\nof the world today, a handful of<br />\nmen elected by no one make the<br />\ndecisions by which the rest of the<br />\npeople of those countries are<br />\nbound.<br />\nIf we want to sell our stock in<br />\ncompanies doing business with<br />\noppressive governments in Africa,<br />\nperhaps we should consider<br />\nAngola.

We<br />\nare concerned with tapping the<br />\ncreative imagination of the entire<br />\nundergraduate body; primarily in<br />\nstudent-opinion articles, but in<br />\nthe arts as well. Ellipsis prints<br />\ncreative writing of the highest<br />\nquality, which in the past, and<br />\nrightfully so, has primarily come<br />\nfrom graduate students who<br />\nintend to become writers. We will<br />\nprint the work of the Psychology<br />\noi Biology major who writes for<br />\nthe pleasure of writing, as well as<br />\nthe English major whose writing<br />\nmay not match that of graduate<br />\nstudents.<br />\nA similar philosophy governs<br />\nour intention to include<br />\nphotography and graphics. At the<br />\npresent, Johns Hopkins<br />\nUniversity lacks a place for artists<br />\nand photographers to publish<br />\ntheir work. Hopkins must begiti<br />\nto promote creativity and skill on<br />\na continuing basis. Zeniada is<br />\nhe proper<br />\ndevoted to<br />\npresentation of artwork and will<br />\nprovide the necessary amount of<br />\nspace and high quality paper to<br />\nencourage artists to submit.<br />\nOur purposes do not conflict<br /><br />\npart of our purpose. He says,<br />\n\"Student opinion on issues of<br />\nnational and international<br />\ninterest -- that is the rightful role<br />\nof such a magazine. No other<br />\nvehicle exists on this campus for<br />\nthe expression of such opinions.\"<br />\nHowever, what the writer seems<br />\nmost concerned about is his<br />\nnotion that by including student<br />\nopinion on local issues and<br />\nUniversity-related feature<br />\narticles, we are infringing upon<br />\nthe rights and territory of the<br />\nNews-Letter itself.<br />\nThis magazine is not and has<br />\nnever been intended to compete<br />\nwith the News-Letter; this idea is<br />\nimplausible, because the primary<br />\npurposes of the publications<br />\ndiffer radically. The News-Letter<br />\nprovides impartial, unbiased<br />\nreports on news events that the<br />\nHopkins community has a right<br />\nand need to know about. Its<br />\nstudent-opinion articles center on<br />\ncontroversial topics \"here at the<br />\nUniversity,\" as the writer himself<br />\nadmits. He praises our intent to<br />\n\"publish student opinion on<br />\nnational and international issues.<br />\nIf the student is inclined to<br />\nsubmit occasional local and<br />\nUniversity-related articles to<br />\nZeniada, why should the<br />\nmagazine refuse to publish them?<br />\nFurthermore, the News-Letter<br />\nsimply cannot devote enough<br />\nspace to publish the amount of<br />\nstudent opinion to which we are<br />\ncommitted without cutting down<br />\non its straight news content.<br />\nStudent opinion is our primary<br />\nconcern.<br />\nThe writer also takes it upon<br />\nhimself to object, on behalf of<br /><br />\nDe Broca's<br />\nCrowning<br />\nTriumph!<br /><br />\nwith those of any current student<br />\npublication. Why should we try<br />\nto combine or divide our efforts<br />\nin order to expand another<br />\nmagazine with its own staff and<br />\nits own purposes?<br />\nThe whole objection of this<br />\neditorial to Zeniada is that we<br />\noverlap Ellipsis and the<br />\nNews-Letter in some areas. It is<br />\nnot a valid objection.

A<br />\nmember of the Hopkins faculty for nearly twenty<br />\nyears, Mr. Arellano ranks as one of the most<br />\npopular and well-liked teachers at the University.<br />\nHis courses in Playwriting are usually filled during<br />\nthe preregistration period, and often the<br />\nunfortunate students who get left out must be<br />\nput on a waiting list.<br />\nThe most distinct feature of the Playwriting<br />\ncourse, besides Mr. Arellano's open and relaxed<br />\nstyle, is the production night, when the best of<br />\nthe class's plays are performed in the Little<br />\nTheatre during finals week. How many professors<br />\nat Hopkins can brag that over 100 people come<br />\nto watch their final exams and make an enjoyable<br />\nevening out of it at that?<br />\nI talked with Mr. Arellano earlier this week in<br />\nthe office of John Barth, a well-known novelist.<br />\nMr. Barth was not present during the interview.<br />\nLet's start at the beginning: when and where<br />\nyou were born.<br /><br />\nwas born in Havana, Cuba . Miny years ago.<br />\n(Laughs)<br />\nWhat was it like growing up in Cuba?<br />\nThe rich were very rich and the poor were<br />\nvery po6r We had ten or eleven servants. You had<br />\nsomebody to mow the lawn, and you had a<br />\nchauffeur, and a chauffeur needed a helper. And<br />\nyou had a cook and the cook needed a helper.<br />\nAnd you had maids. This was the old-style social<br />\norder, which was very unjust.<br />\nWhen and why did you come to the United<br />\nStates?<br />\nWell, I was very much pro-Castro in the<br />\nbeginning, and very much against Baptista, who<br />\nwas the dictator before Castro. So when Castro<br />\ntook over, I was very happy about that, for about<br />\nsix months. Then he kicked out the presidents<br />\nand he took over the whole island, the whole<br />\ngovernment, 2.,id then I got very unhappy about<br />\nit and decided to leave Cuba and come to the<br />\nUnited _States. I realized Castro was trying to<br />\nturn Cuba into a Communist state, which he did.<br />\nSo I left, and then I started going to MIT.<br />\nWhere did you get your various degrees<br />\nfrom?<br />\nI got my masters degree in chemistry at<br />\nMIT. Then I came up to Baltimore and started<br />\nworking here with Dr. Orwin who used to run the<br />\norganic chemistry course. I was doing research for<br />\nhim. Then I always wanted to write, so in my<br />\nspare time I took writing seminars courses here<br />\nand eventually I got a masters degree from the<br />\nWriting Seminars at Hopkins.<br />\nDid you go straight into teaching after<br />\ngraduating from MIT?<br />\nAfter finishing at MIT; I went back to<br />\nCuba. My father had his own business, so I started<br />\nworking with him. He used to represent American<br />\nMotors in Cuba, which was a very nice<br />\narrangement that we had. Of course, Castro then<br />\ntook over the whole thing.<br /><br />\nHow did you become interested in<br />\nchemistry, and then writing?<br />\nChemistry was my first love, I think. In<br />\nhigh school in Cuba, I had a very good chemistry<br />\nteacher. i got interested in chemistry and when I<br />\ngraduated from high school, I applied tog.MIT,and went there for five years.<br />\nIt was after I graduated from college and went<br />\nback to Cuba to work with my father that I<br />\nstarted writing short stories. When I came here to<br />\nHopkins and I saw they had the Writing Seminars,<br />\nI realized that was an ideal opportunity for me to<br />\ntake some courses, which I did. Eventually I took<br />\nenough courses so that I got a degree.<br />\nDo you think a writer should have another<br />\nvocation, in addition to being a writer, in order to<br />\nstay in the mainstream of life, so to speak?<br /><br />\nALL IN THE FAMILY or MASH?<br />\nI don't see much that's impressive. Not very<br />\nmuch. The British have done a good job, much<br />\nbetter than we have. Situation comedy is<br />\noverdone on TV. But sure, if you want to waste<br />\nan hour or two, go ahead. (Laughs) Sometimes<br />\nit's alright. You might want to read a detective<br />\nnovel, or science fiction. Something you don't<br />\nhave to think about.<br />\nHow did the playwriting class evolve?<br /><br />\nst<br />\nSt<br /><br />\nJACK OF TVV1<br /><br />\nIt really depends on the writer. It has<br />\nworked for me, and I've enjoyed working in both<br />\nfields. Not every writer has this \"schizophrenic\"<br />\nset-up like I do, chemistry and writing. But<br />\nwhat's worked for me might not work for other<br />\npeople.<br />\nHow many of your plays have been<br />\nproduced?<br />\nSeveral of my plays have been produced<br />\nlocally. Corner Theatre produced two of them.<br />\nTowson State University produced two. Here at<br />\nHopkins one of my plays was produced last year,<br />\nand three or four years ago also.<br />\nstarted writing short stories, but they had<br />\nmore dialogue than description, so eventually I<br />\nthought, if I'm writing so much dialogue, why<br />\nnot write a play? So I started writing plays.<br />\nHow does a writer get his plays produced?<br />\nYou have to go to New York. You write to<br />\nagents and tell them what you have. You send<br />\nthem the play, they look it over, and decide<br />\nwhether its's producible or not, whether or not<br />\nit's going to make any money.<br />\nDo you do any other kind of writing<br />\nbesides plays?<br />\nRight now only plays. I've given up on<br />\nshort stories. I like playwriting more than writing<br />\nfiction. I tried poetry years ago, but I gave it up.<br />\nIt's just not my field.<br />\nWas any of your creative writing ever<br />\npublished?<br />\nI wrote a story once, and I sold it to a<br />\nbrand new magazine. After the first issue, I got a<br />\nletter from the editor saying that my story would<br />\nbe printed in the second issue. But the magazine<br />\ncollapsed after the first issue. (Laughs) But, they<br />\npaid me for it.<br />\nHow many chemistry papers have you<br />\npublished?<br />\nI've had four published, in the Journal of<br />\nOrganic Chemistry.<br />\nWhat's your opinion ofcontemporary drama?<br />\nWell, I'm really a fanatic about Albee. But<br />\nnot<br />\nvery much a fan of the Theatre of the<br />\nI'm<br />\nAbsurd, you know, Pinter, people like that. I do<br />\nlike some of it though. Pinter's Old Times I<br />\nenjoyed very much. I like David Storey, Tom<br />\nStoppard.<br />\nWho are your favorite fiction writers?<br />\nI don't do much reading in fiction. Lately<br />\nI've been reading some of the Latin American<br />\nwriters, like Garcia Marquez and Borges. I've just<br />\ndiscovered them because I was neglecting most of<br />\nwhat was being written in Spanish.<br />\nI've read a lot of Barth. I read all of the books<br />\nthat we teach in American contemporary letters.<br />\nIs that where _Your taste in literature usually<br />\nruns?<br />\nWell, I would't say that. I read them all,<br />\nand some of them I enjoy very much. But<br />\ngenerally, my favorites are the Latin American<br />\nwriters.<br />\nDo you think any good drama is being done<br />\n. r instance, on some of.the sq-coms like<br />\non TV, Jo<br /><br />\nd,<br />\ntl<br /><br />\nby Patrick E<br /><br />\nI guess it came out of the unrest of the late<br />\nsixties and early seventies. As a matter of fact,<br />\nwhen the class started, it was called PROBLEM<br />\nDRAMA.<br />\nWhose problem was it?<br />\nOh, the problems of the University, remember<br />\nthose days, there was a question of audxrity who<br />\nshould decide things. There was a lot of upheaval,<br />\nalthough Hopkins wasn't that bad. It was<br />\ngenerally very quiet. But there was a group of<br />\nstudents who were interested in drama, so I<br />\noffered to teach a course in it. Most of the plays<br />\nthat were written were about the Vietnam War,<br />\nsituations in the University. That's how it started<br />\nand that's why it was called PROBLEM DRAMA.<br />\nAt first it was not a credited course. Eventually,<br />\nstudents wanted to know if it was a credited<br />\ncourse because they were putting a lot of time<br />\ninto it. I asked Elliot Coleman, chairman of the<br />\nWriting Seminars at the time, and he said yes.<br />\nWe went to the Dean, and he said yes. This was in<br /><br />\nsti<br />\ncl<br />\nIc<br />\nan<br />\nve<br />\nin<br />\nto<br />\nAi<br />\nju<br />\nI<br />\nth<br /><br />\nc(<br /><br />\ny(<br /><br />\n'71<br /><br />\nBut the class has changed completely, just as<br /><br />\npi<br /><br />\nWO TRADES<br /><br />\nick Eacolano<br /><br />\nThat's hard to answer because I enjoy both.<br />\nIt's refreshing to change from one to the other.<br />\nOne provides relief from the other.<br />\nHow long have you been teaching?<br />\nI've been here at Hopkins since 1959. How have the students changed since then?<br />\nThe youth of today is being compared to the<br />\nyouth of the 50's. Do you see that?<br />\nOf, definitely. When I first came here, the<br />\nstudents were very much like the students of my<br />\ncollege days, you know, carefree. They just<br />\nworried about their studies, and dating, and their<br />\ngirl friends. Then came the sixties, and that was<br />\nan unprecedented thing as far as I know; students<br />\nrebelling, getting involved in politics, and fighting<br />\nthe University. This lasted a few years, then it<br />\nsubsided again back to the student who cares<br />\nonly about his work and his girl friend.<br />\nI don't know how to explain what happened in<br />\nthe universities during the later sixties and early<br />\nseventies. I supported the students, I was very<br />\nmuch against the Vietnam War. A lot of things<br />\nhave changed because of it. We<br />\nnow have<br />\nstudent trustees, and I think the Administration<br />\nnowadays pays a lot more attention to the<br />\nstudents than it did ten years ago. And I think<br />\nthis is a result of the sixties. Now everything that<br />\nhappened then was good. Burning down buildings<br />\nand putting bombs in buildings is definitely not<br />\ngood. But the students had a reasonable gripe.<br />\nNobody was paying any attention to them. Now<br />\nthe Administration does pay attention to them.<br />\nHave you ever considered teaching<br />\nsomewhere other than Hopkins?<br />\n..Not seriously, no.<br />\nI haven't looked. I've<br />\nenjoyed my stay at Hopkins over the years. I<br />\nwouldn't consider going anywhere else right now.<br /><br />\nplay writing?<br /><br />\nare.<br /><br />\nilustration b<br /><br />\nAnother thing that's helped a lot is that people<br />\ncome to see the plays, and they think, \"Wow, if<br />\nmy roommate can do it, then so can I.\" It's<br />\nword-of-mouth, mostly.<br />\nHas any famous playwright come out of<br />\nyour class yet?<br />\nNo, not yet.(Laughs) But I'm hoping.<br />\nWhich do you enjoy more, chemistry or<br /><br />\nAre yoii conscious of any hostility between<br />\nthe Writing Seminars and the English<br />\ndepartments?<br />\nOh, definitely not. We even share<br />\nprofessors.<br />\nNoted sage Cates Baldridge has said that, Writirw<br />\nSeminarsIN ,;pk,think that, writing began with Joyce while<br />\nEnglish department people think that it ended<br />\nwith Joyce.<br />\nIt may be true that there are differences of<br />\nopinion, but I don't know of any specific<br />\ninstance of violent disagreement. We collaborate<br />\nvery much.<br />\nDo you think that Hopkins professors place<br />\ntoo much emphasis on research and not enough<br />\non their classes and students?<br />\nWell, unfortunately, that's part of the<br />\nsystem. You hire a professor usually on the basis<br />\nof his publications. In some of the departments<br />\nhere--I won't say which--the emphasis is on<br />\nresearch and publishing,and not so much on<br />\nteaching. That's not just at Hopkins. That's at<br />\nevery university. I think more emphasis should be<br />\nput on teaching, especially at the undergraduate<br />\nlevel. The contact between a faculty member and<br />\nhis student is almost nil at times. For instance, in<br />\nchemistry we have 300 students in one class. It's<br />\nimpossible to get acquainted with all those<br />\nstudents, to have any kind of social relationship<br />\nwith all of them. You hardly get to know their<br />\nnames. In the Writing Seminars, it's much better<br />\nbecause the classes are limited to fifteen students<br />\nas a rule, because they're mostly seminars and<br />\nworkshops.<br />\nDo you think the undergraduate at Hopkins<br />\nis overlooked in favor of the graduate student?<br />\nThat depends on the department. The<br />\ngraduate does research for a professor, and he<br />\ndoes research much better than an undergraduate.<br />\nSo it's natural for a professor to want graduate<br />\nstudents working for him because that means<br />\nhe'll be able to publish more. This is a<br />\nresearch-oriented institution. Most universities<br /><br />\n'Why do you think the course is so popular?<br />\nIt's a different course from what every<br />\nstudent has to take at the University. As I say in<br />\nclass, we're not looking at your intelligence, your<br />\nIQ, how well you do in exams. We're looking at<br />\nan aspect which the University doesn't explore<br />\nvery much, and that's the emotional part of any<br />\nindividual. I'm interested in how well you're able<br />\nto communicate your feelings, your emotions.<br />\nAnd I think it's refreshing. You know, man is not<br />\njust intelligence. Man has his emotional side. And<br />\nthink that's one reason why people like to take<br />\nthe playwriting course.<br /><br />\nWhat do you think of the system of having<br />\n\"teaching assistants\"for undergrads?<br />\nI think it works. The University applied for<br />\na grant from the Kenan Foundation two years<br />\nago. They gave Hopkins $750,000 to improve<br />\nundergraduate education. I got S3000 the first<br />\nyear, and S2000 the sectnd year. Since I'm so<br />\nconcerned with T.A.'s, I felt that we were missing<br />\nsomething. Look at most T.A.'s. Last year they<br />\nwere seniors at college, right? This year they get<br />\nadmitted here, they get their stipends, and all of a,<br />\nsudden they're teachers! That's why/ I applied for<br />\nthis Kenan Foundation grant. I said, I want to<br />\nbring the T.A.'s here a week ahead of time, get a<br />\nfew T.A.'s from last year, and get them to teach<br />\nthese new T.A.'s how to teach. So these<br />\nprospective T.A.'s conic here a week ahead of<br />\ntime, they have meetings in the morning and<br />\nafternoon, and go over all the books they're going<br />\nto be teaching. Then they each take a book and<br />\npresent it to the other T.A.'s, as if they were<br />\nteaching a class. I've done this for the last two<br />\nyears, and I've done this with the chemistry<br />\nT.A.'s also. They come in, also a week ahead of<br />\ntime, and go over all the experiments they're<br />\ngoing to teach the freshmen. I think this has<br />\nworked very well for both departments.<br /><br />\nHow true is \"publish or perish?\"<br />\nI think it's true at every university. The<br />\nemphasis is on publishing, no doubt about that.<br />\nNot enough emphasis is placed on teaching, but<br />\nthat's not to say we don't have any good<br />\nteachers 'hciTe, because we do. But it's hard to be a<br />\ngood teacher and a good researcher at the same<br />\ntime.<br /><br />\nIs the world of the university any less real<br />\nthan the world that exists outside the boundaries<br />\nof the campus?<br />\nI don't want to call the years you spend in<br />\ncollege,\"unreal,\" because they're not unreal. The<br />\nfour years- are like a retreat, where you try to<br />\nprepare yourself for the rest of your life. I<br />\nwouldn't call that \"unreal.\"<br />\nIt's a kind of womb-like existence. That's why<br />\nI call it a retreat. It's like the philosopher who<br />\ngoes into the desert for two or three weeks just<br />\nthinking and trying to elaborate on his thoughts<br />\nand ideas and his future. It's a period of<br />\nlearning--and I don't just mean learning more<br />\nchemistry or more history ar more English.<br />\nYou're learning about yourself. This is why I<br />\ndon't think it's \"unreal.\" For instance, I've had<br />\nmany students who decide to drop out of<br />\npre-med. They start to think, \"Well, maybe I'm<br />\ndoing this because my father wants me to be a<br />\ndoctor. But I really like literature a lot, so maybe<br />\nI should be in the English department.\" You're<br />\nlearning about yourself. Is college womb-like?<br />\nYes. But it's a necessary thing, I think. To find<br />\nout about yourself, you have to escape from the<br />\nworld for a while to think.<br /><br />\nphotos by John Gunn<br /><br />\nthe students have changed. People weren't<br />\ndemanding things from the University as much as<br />\nthey were in the past, so the students just started<br />\nwriting plays.<br />\nHow many students have taken the course<br />\nover the years?<br />\nYou figure about 25 to 30 each semester,<br />\nplus about 15 each intersession, then there's<br />\nsummer school, but they're not Hopkins<br />\nstudents. We put on about 60 plays a year.<br /><br />\nPAGE 14 I OCTOBER 6,1978<br /><br />\nFor a good time, call<br /><br />\nThree Six Six - Five Oh Seven Six<br />\nand ask for<br />\nI have always considered myself something of a rebel.'<br />\nFearless. Uninhibited. Not afraid to deviate from the<br />\nnorm. So when I moved into a new apartment this fall, I<br />\ndecided to wait awhile before installing a phone.<br />\nThis may not strike you as being a particularly radical<br />\nact. To be perfectly honest, I didn't think much of it at<br />\nthe time. Now, barely a month later, I marvel at my own<br />\ninnocence. For by not immediately rushing out and<br />\ngetting myself plugged in, I found myself gradually being<br />\nlabelled a misanthrope. Uncommunicative. Unwilling to<br />\nshare my life with the community at large.<br />\nThe first signs of an establishment reaction came,<br />\npredictably, from my mother. At .first, she was patient.<br />\n(\"Well, just let us know when you get one,\" she'd sigh.)<br />\nLater, she became restless. (\"When are you going to get a<br />\nphone?\") Still later, self-righteous indignation began to<br />\nset in. (\"Oh, Billy! You mean to say you still haven't got<br />\none?\") Finally, my delay in getting a phone became a<br />\npersonal rejection. \"I think you're deliberately not getting<br />\na phone. so I can't talk to you,\" the argument went. This<br />\nlast accusation seemed to me to be on the verge of<br />\nparanoid hysteria -- but after all, moms are like that.<br />\nThen my girlfriend started getting into the act. \"You're<br />\ntrying to avoid me,\" she said. \"Why don't you want to<br />\nspeak to me?\" I, don't need to tell you it was only a<br />\nmatter of time before these complaints were translated<br />\ninto,\"you don't love me.\"<br />\nThis was a little disturbing, but I still thought I might<br />\nbe able to stick it out. After all, I was independent. Why<br />\nshould I get a phone just to satisfy the whims of a couple<br />\nof insecure, overpossessive females?<br />\nBut I was still operating under the delusion that society<br />\nwould actually permit me to exist without a phone. After<br />\nall. sonic of my relatives had come pretty close. My<br />\ngreat-aunt and uncle have a cabin in Maine where they<br />\ndon't like to be disturbed. However, they feel they have<br />\ntoo many friends not to have a phone. Their solution was<br />\nto install a phone on the trunk of a tree some 200 yards<br />\naway from the cabin. If they want to call out, they can do<br />\nso simply by taking a short hike. And if they happen to<br />\nbe walking by the tree while the phone is ringing, they<br />\nanswer it.(This happens about once or twice a year.)<br />\nBut Maine ain't Baltimore, and my great-aunt and uncle<br /><br />\nBill Newlin<br />\ndon't go to Hopkins. If they did, they wouldn't be able to<br />\nhold out for more than a month.<br />\nPerhaps the reason phones are such a necessity here is<br />\nthat during freshman year (when you really don't need a<br />\nphone) everyone gets into the habit of seeing their friends<br />\nall the time. Then, when the Housing Office takes away<br />\nour lollipops and kicks us out into the big, wide,<br />\nAll-America city, we want to keep up the close contact<br /><br />\nIllustration by Lisa Kay Pease<br />\nwe established during that first idyllic (?) year.<br />\nMaybe it's just a contagious disease.<br />\nBut whatever the reason, Hopkins students (and<br />\nprobably students in general) place an unusual degree of<br />\nemphasis on phones.<br />\nIt wasn't so bad at first, not having a phone. In fact,<br />\nmost people acted very solicitous towards me, as if they<br /><br />\nunderstood it could happen to anyone. Sympathetic faces<br />\ntold me they, too, were having trouble starting a new<br />\nsemester -- perhaps I hadn't found an apartment yet, or<br />\nwas having trouble making an appointment.<br />\nMy days of grace, however, were shortlived. These same<br />\npeople, when told a week later I still didn't have a phone,<br />\nacted sullen, bitter and resentful. Strangers asking for my<br />\nnumber would smile quizzically when I refused them,<br />\nthen turn abruptly on their heels, muttering under their<br />\nbreaths.<br />\nAnd it didn't stop there. Things went rapidly from bad<br />\nto worse. Old friends began stopping me on the street just<br />\nto ask me whether I'd gotten a phone. Others just stopped<br />\nspeaking to me altogether. The bank threatened to stop<br />\ncashing my checks. As for me, I began to suffer from an<br />\nidentity crisis.<br />\nFinally, I couldn't take it any longer. My experiment in<br />\nfree living was a colossal failure. During a month of living<br />\nwithout the benefit of a seven-digit number I was<br />\nquestioned, cross-questioned, cajoled, implored and,<br />\nfinally, threatened. I fell victim to more institutional<br />\npressure than a Soviet dissident. In the end, I discovered<br />\nHopkins is not a free community. You can cut classes.<br />\nYou can take drugs. You can even go to the Rat wearing<br />\nnothing but a jock and a bra. But you can't not have a<br />\nphone.<br />\nYesterday I took the final, irrevocable step<br />\n(incidentally, the first thing C&amp;P asked me when I told<br />\nthem I wanted a new phone was, \"What's your phone<br />\nnumber, sir?\"). It's sitting on my desk now, black and<br />\nugly, leering at me. Pretty soon the damn thing is going to<br />\nstart ringing. And since I figure you bastards are going to<br />\nget ahold of my phone number anyway and start calling<br />\nme up at 6 am when I didn't get to sleep until four asking<br />\nme whether you can copy my history notes, I decided to<br />\ngo out in style.

Play ended in a<br />\nscoreless first half tally, but<br />\nKutztown came back in the<br />\nsecond half to take advantage of<br />\nHopkins defensive holes and<br />\npump in two goals past net<br />\ntender Kenny Suesse.<br />\nIn Saturday's game against<br />\nUrsinus. the Jays played solidly<br /><br />\nand impressively in contrast to<br />\nWednesday's disappointing loss.<br />\nThis was due, in large measure, to<br />\nthe stunning individual<br />\nperformance of Senior Lee<br />\nFriant, who scored both<br />\nHopkins' goals by racing ahead of<br />\nhis defender and kicking the ball<br />\nin past the Ursinus goal tender.<br />\nAlthough play was rough, with<br />\nfive Hopkins kickers injured in<br />\nvarious stages of the game, the<br />\nreferee took no action until late<br />\nin the second half, when an<br />\nUrsinus lineman was issued a<br />\nwarning and another was<br />\nexpelled from the game.<br />\nThroughout the game, the Jays<br />\nplayed brilliantly on the attack,<br />\nby cutting in and forging past<br />\nawaiting Ursinus defenders. Lee<br />\nFriant, aided by Bobby Teasdall,<br />\nMarty Wolf and Chaim Levin<br />\nsucceeded in taking advantage of<br />\nUrsinus' weak defense by<br />\nbreaking away and driving down<br />\nfield toward the opponent's goal.<br />\nThe Jay defense, composed of<br />\nSeniors Kenny Suisse, Steve<br />\nGalloway, Sophomore Mike<br /><br />\nDIXIE<br /><br />\nAfter taking it on the chin last<br />\nweek, Dixie Dick threw up his<br />\nhands in despair and sighed,<br />\n\"Any male chimpanzee over the<br />\nage of 13 could outpick Dixie<br />\nDick's picks!\" As a result of this<br />\nrare moment of weakness, we<br />\nwere forced to contact the<br />\nDurham kingpin Big Jim, Dixie<br />\nDick's pal who rules the rackets<br />\ndown in Carolina country.

The JHU women<br />\ndominated the Georgetown team,<br />\nallowing only three shots against<br />\nrookie goalie Lynn Katz.<br />\nHowever, the next game was a<br />\nless dazzling performance, as the<br />\nteam was beaten by a<br />\nbetter-trained Franklin and<br />\nMarshall team on F&amp;M's own<br />\nfield. Coach Morse admitted .that<br />\nHopkins had never played on a<br />\nfield that was so well trimmed.<br />\nShe said her team was \"just<br />\noutplayed.\"<br />\nThe third game of the season<br />\nwent well throughout the first<br />\nhalf, and the game remained<br />\nscoreless at halftime. But the first<br />\nfive minutes of the second half<br />\nsaw Dickinson score while<br />\nstopping the JHU offense cold<br />\nfor the rest of the contest. The<br />\ngame ended in a 2-0 defeat, a<br />\nperformance that could best be<br />\ndescribed as lack-ruster. Said<br />\nCoach Morse, \"The girls weren't<br />\nplaying with their hearts in the<br />\ngame. We could have won.\"<br />\nThe fourth game of the season<br />\nwill be played this afternoon at<br />\nfour pm on the \"B\" Field,<br />\nagainst Catholic University.<br /><br />\nNEWS-LETTER I PAGE 23<br /><br />\nFraternity Frolics (from page 3)<br />\ncommon.
