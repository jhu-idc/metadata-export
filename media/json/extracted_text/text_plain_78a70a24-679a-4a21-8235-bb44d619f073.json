The results were both<br />\ngood and bad; bad in that the<br />\nteam lost to the Midshipmen, yet<br />\ngood in that the strengths and<br />\nweaknesses were learned, and<br />\ngood, of course that 'Hopkins<br />\ndefeated UMBC.<br />\nNavy certainly did their part as<br />\ntalented opponents, beating the<br />\nJays 15-12. In spite of the fact<br />\nthat the Naval Academy is<br />\nknown as a national fencing<br />\npower, most members of the<br />\nHopkins squad entered the<br />\ncontest feeling that they could<br />\npull off the upset. Things started<br />\noff badly, though, as the Middies<br />\nswept the first of three rounds in<br />\nsabre, taking a 3-0 lead. The Jay<br />\nfoilmen struck right back,<br />\nwinning the next three bouts by<br />\none touch apiece. Sophomore<br />\nTim Rodgers won his first varsity<br />\nepee bought to bring Hopkins<br />\nback to within 4-5 at the end of<br />\nthe first round. The team pulled<br />\nbriefly into the lead as Bruce<br />\nLivingston and John Roberts<br />\nwon their second sabre bouts.<br />\n<br />\nThe foil team chipped in two<br />\nmore but the epee team was shut<br />\nout in the second round and<br />\nHopkins now trailed 8-10.<br />\nIn the third round Livingston<br />\nwon his second bout, but both<br />\nRoberts and Ron Kramer lost.<br />\nMark Davis, Glen Pantel and<br />\nRobert Baum all won their final<br />\nbouts of the day, and the Jays<br />\nmomentarily drew even with<br />\nNavy at 12-12. The Middies<br />\nclinched the meet, though, as<br />\nRodgers and John Burdakin were<br />\ndefeated by the last two<br />\nmembers of the strong Navy epee<br />\nteam.<br />\nOne bright spot of the match<br />\nwas the good showing of the foil<br />\nteam, which went 7-2, with both<br />\nPantel and Baum going<br />\nundefeated.<br />\nAgainst UMBC, however, the<br />\nHomewood fencers had things<br />\ntheir own way, blasting Vernon<br />\nBurnett's fledgling squad 24-3.<br />\nThe sabreurs cut smoothly<br />\nthrough their UMBC<br />\ncounterparts, as Bruce<br />\nLivingston, John Roberts, and<br />\nRon Kramer all went 3-0. The<br />\nfoil team of Glen Pantel, Robert<br />\nBaum, and Mike Brunner again<br />\nshowed its muscle, allowing the<br />\n<br />\nTim Rodgers (1.) catches a Navy epeeist off balance.<br />\n<br />\ninexperienced UMBC foilmen<br />\nonly three touches in nine bouts.<br />\nThe epee team once more fell<br />\nbehind with starters Mark Davis.<br />\nJohn Burdakin, and Tim Rodgen<br />\neach dropping a bout.<br />\nAfter one scrimmage and one<br />\nmeet the important question<br />\nwhich must be answered is<br />\nwhether the team can achieve<br />\ngood balance, which will be<br />\nneeded for a stellar season.<br />\n<br />\nMorgan State, led by the<br />\nrecord shattering performance of<br />\n7 foot All-American Marvin<br />\nWebster, rolled to their second<br />\nstraight championship with a<br />\n79-65 pasting of Towson State in<br />\nlast night's title match.<br />\nThe Blue Jays opened their<br />\nseason Friday night in the<br />\ntourney's first round showcase<br />\ntilt against the University of<br />\nBaltimore, a team Hopkins had<br />\nnever faced before. After<br />\ncontrolling the opening minutes<br />\non the strength of Greg DeLong's<br />\nshot selection and 5'9\" guard<br />\nJohn Rutter's boardwork,<br />\nHopkins suddenly seemed to stop<br />\nand take a breather. Frank<br />\nSyzmanski's Bees took the<br />\nopportunity to come roaring<br />\nback and to take the halftime<br />\nlead, 44-40.<br />\nHopkins superstar Bill Jews,<br />\nsaddled with three personal fouls<br />\nand a miserable shooting<br />\npercentage at the half, could find<br />\nno better luck offensively in the<br />\nfinal twenty minutes. He ended<br />\nwith seven points on 3-for-19<br />\nfrom the floor and five fouls.<br />\nHowever, Jews' wait-and-see<br />\ndefensive work forced numerous<br />\nturnovers in the final period and<br />\nfreed Blue Jay center Chuck La<br />\nBerge for additional point<br />\nproduction. The 6'5\" senior from<br />\n<br />\nDallas, Pa., playing the finest<br />\ngame of his four year Hopkins<br />\ncareer, collected 22 points,<br />\nfourteen of these in the second<br />\nhalf.<br />\nThe second half comeback<br />\nculminated in a 75-75 tie with 28<br />\nseconds remaining. The Jays and<br />\nBees traded fouls to account for<br />\nthe final points of the game:<br />\nhowever, Hopkins finished off a<br />\n41 percent showing at the line<br />\nwith half of a one-on-one<br />\nopportunity, while B.U. sank a<br />\npair. The 77-76 loss sent the Blue<br />\nJays into the fifth place<br />\nconsolation against Loyola.<br />\nSeemingly not content with<br />\nthis performance, Hopkins'<br />\nCharles Street neighbors came<br />\nout firing last night. After<br />\nabsorbing a 51 point barrage in<br />\nthe first half the Jays regrouped<br />\nto come back. Trailing by as<br />\nmany as 18 points at 59-41,<br />\nBobby Freedman and Bill Jews<br />\nsparked a drive that brought the<br />\nteam to within two (68-66)<br />\nAt this point the Jays<br />\nreflected once again their lack of<br />\nstamina, hibernating for a full 41<br />\n/<br />\n2<br />\nminutes before John Rutter<br />\nbroke the spell. By this time it<br />\nwas too late, however, for Loyola<br />\nhad restored a twelve point lead<br />\nand needed merely to run out the<br />\nclock.<br />\n<br />\nMatmen appear strong in opener<br />\nBy CAT STEVENS<br />\nThe Blue Jay matmen rode to<br />\nLebanon Valley College for the<br />\nfirst tournament of the season<br />\nwith optimism and flew away<br />\nwith a strong fourth place finish<br />\nlast weekend. Of the nine men<br />\nwrestling for Hopkins, seven<br />\nplaced in the top four of their<br />\nweight class.<br />\n\"It was a great team<br />\nperformance!\" Coach Harry<br />\nGotwals remarked with elation.<br />\n\"It was the best showing by a<br />\nHopkins wrestling team in many<br />\nyears.\"<br />\nAlthough there were no<br />\nindividual winners, captain Neil<br />\nHazard and sophomore Gary<br />\nMurza took seconds. Third place<br />\nhonors were won by captain<br />\nClark Kingery, Ron Pucillo, Mike<br />\nPrivatera and Wayne Panullo.<br />\nDave Mulock finished in fourth<br />\nplace. The 84 team points<br />\nHopkins earned tripled last year's<br />\noutput.<br />\nMurza came closest to winning<br />\nbut in the heavyweight finals he<br />\nwas unable to execute a reversal<br />\non the 300 pound blob from<br />\n<br />\nDelaware Valley and lost in<br />\novertime. While Murza was<br />\nwinning 16 points for the team,<br />\nHazard garnered 161<br />\n/<br />\n2 in the 190<br />\nweight class.<br />\nHazard destroyed three<br />\nopponents on the way to his final<br />\nmatch. There he met Lebanon<br />\nValley's Sanko, who had one less<br />\nmatch. Fatigue took its toll and<br />\nHazard lost, 9-1.<br />\nPucillo, at 118, led the rush<br />\nfor third place. In amassing 11<br />\nteam points, Pucillo beat three<br />\nmen decisively, losing only to the<br />\neventual winner.<br />\nA gutty performance in the.<br />\nconsolation match capped a 101<br />\n/<br />\n2<br />\npoint binge by Privatera.

In the weeks following<br />\nthe coup the violence continued<br />\nunabated and numerous deaths<br />\nand executions were reported in<br />\nthe news media (see, for<br />\nexample, the report of October<br />\n8 in Newsweek). Since the<br />\nmiddle of October, however<br />\nvery little information has been<br />\nforthcoming concerning the<br />\nsituation in Chile. Therefore, it<br />\nmay come as a surprise to many<br />\nto know that the violence has<br />\nnot abated. General Pinochet, a<br />\nlong-time member of an<br />\nextreme right-wing group inside<br />\nof the Chilean army, appears to<br />\nbe putting into practice a<br />\n.40r<br />\nigreCk<br /><br />\n.81\u2018.<br /><br />\nIt Is very difficult, under the<br /><br />\npresent circumstances, to<br />\nascertain exactly what is<br />\nhappening in Chile. It is also<br />\ndifficult to explain the virtual<br />\nnews blackout in the United<br />\nStates. We have documented,<br />\nmainly from materials brought<br />\nout of Chile in recent weeks,<br />\nthe following examples of<br />\nviolent repression that we<br />\nwould like to draw to your<br />\nattention:<br />\n1) The director of the 10th<br />\nHealth Zone of the Chilean<br />\nNational Health Service was<br />\nshot for training Mapuche<br />\nIndians as health workers<br />\n2) Hundreds of medical<br />\nschool teachers, doctors, and<br />\nmedical students who worked in<br />\nneighborhood health centers<br />\nand in rural areas, or who had<br />\notherwise been interested in<br />\ncommunity medicine were<br />\nrequired to appear before<br />\nprosecutors. some suspended<br />\n'from medical school, some<br />\n'imprisoned and some executed.<br />\nIn a small town in southern<br />\nChile, for example, out of 20<br />\npracticing doctors, half have<br />\nbeen imprisoned or shot for<br />\nparticipating in community<br />\nhealth center programs.<br />\n3) The universities have been<br />\ntaken over by the military and<br />\nall actual or reputed supporters<br />\nof the Allende government have<br />\nbeen dismissed. At best these<br />\npeople are unemployed and at<br />\nworst they have been arbitrarily<br />\nexecuted as common criminals.<br />\nThe Department of Sociology at<br />\nthe University of Santiago has<br />\nbeen disbanded and schools of<br />\npublic health across the country<br />\nhave been closed.<br />\n4) Labor organizations and<br />\nmany professional associations<br />\nhave been proscribed, their files<br />\nconfiscated and many officials<br />\nimprisoned or placed under<br />\nhouse arrest.<br />\nThese examples are<br />\n. representative of the situation<br />\nas it currently exists in Chile.<br />\nWe are disturbed that this sort<br />\nof information is not being<br />\nbrought to the attention of the<br />\nAmerican public that the<br />\nUniversity Community remains,<br />\nby and large, indifferent and<br />\nignorant as to the fate of their<br />\nChilean colleagues and that a<br />\ngovernment reputedly so<br />\nconcerned about a notential<br />\nbloodbath in Vietnam has<br />\n\u2018,Cercised no restraining<br /><br />\ninfluence with respect to an<br />\nThe Couise Guide's main goal<br />\nactual bloodbath in Chile.<br />\nis to transmit as much<br />\nA number of national information as possible<br />\norganizations have been set up concerning upcoming academic<br />\nto find ways to help Chileans courses offered to the students<br />\nand to publicize the present sad here.

The results were both<br />\ngood and bad; bad in that the<br />\nteam lost to the Midshipmen, yet<br />\ngood in that the strengths and<br />\nweaknesses were learned, and<br />\ngood, of course that 'Hopkins<br />\ndefeated UMBC.<br />\nNavy certainly did their part as<br />\ntalented opponents, beating the<br />\nJays 15-12. In spite of the fact<br />\nthat the Naval Academy is<br />\nknown as a national fencing<br />\npower, most members of the<br />\nHopkins squad entered the<br />\ncontest feeling that they could<br />\npull off the upset. Things started<br />\noff badly, though, as the Middies<br />\nswept the first of three rounds in<br />\nsabre, taking a 3-0 lead. The Jay<br />\nfoilmen struck right back,<br />\nwinning the next three bouts by<br />\none touch apiece. Sophomore<br />\nTim Rodgers won his first varsity<br />\nepee bought to bring Hopkins<br />\nback to within 4-5 at the end of<br />\nthe first round. The team pulled<br />\nbriefly into the lead as Bruce<br />\nLivingston and John Roberts<br />\nwon their second sabre bouts.<br /><br />\nThe foil team chipped in two<br />\nmore but the epee team was shut<br />\nout in the second round and<br />\nHopkins now trailed 8-10.<br />\nIn the third round Livingston<br />\nwon his second bout, but both<br />\nRoberts and Ron Kramer lost.<br />\nMark Davis, Glen Pantel and<br />\nRobert Baum all won their final<br />\nbouts of the day, and the Jays<br />\nmomentarily drew even with<br />\nNavy at 12-12. The Middies<br />\nclinched the meet, though, as<br />\nRodgers and John Burdakin were<br />\ndefeated by the last two<br />\nmembers of the strong Navy epee<br />\nteam.<br />\nOne bright spot of the match<br />\nwas the good showing of the foil<br />\nteam, which went 7-2, with both<br />\nPantel and Baum going<br />\nundefeated.<br />\nAgainst UMBC, however, the<br />\nHomewood fencers had things<br />\ntheir own way, blasting Vernon<br />\nBurnett's fledgling squad 24-3.<br />\nThe sabreurs cut smoothly<br />\nthrough their UMBC<br />\ncounterparts, as Bruce<br />\nLivingston, John Roberts, and<br />\nRon Kramer all went 3-0. The<br />\nfoil team of Glen Pantel, Robert<br />\nBaum, and Mike Brunner again<br />\nshowed its muscle, allowing the<br /><br />\nTim Rodgers (1.) catches a Navy epeeist off balance.<br /><br />\ninexperienced UMBC foilmen<br />\nonly three touches in nine bouts.<br />\nThe epee team once more fell<br />\nbehind with starters Mark Davis.<br />\nJohn Burdakin, and Tim Rodgen<br />\neach dropping a bout.<br />\nAfter one scrimmage and one<br />\nmeet the important question<br />\nwhich must be answered is<br />\nwhether the team can achieve<br />\ngood balance, which will be<br />\nneeded for a stellar season.<br /><br />\nMorgan State, led by the<br />\nrecord shattering performance of<br />\n7 foot All-American Marvin<br />\nWebster, rolled to their second<br />\nstraight championship with a<br />\n79-65 pasting of Towson State in<br />\nlast night's title match.<br />\nThe Blue Jays opened their<br />\nseason Friday night in the<br />\ntourney's first round showcase<br />\ntilt against the University of<br />\nBaltimore, a team Hopkins had<br />\nnever faced before. After<br />\ncontrolling the opening minutes<br />\non the strength of Greg DeLong's<br />\nshot selection and 5'9\" guard<br />\nJohn Rutter's boardwork,<br />\nHopkins suddenly seemed to stop<br />\nand take a breather. Frank<br />\nSyzmanski's Bees took the<br />\nopportunity to come roaring<br />\nback and to take the halftime<br />\nlead, 44-40.<br />\nHopkins superstar Bill Jews,<br />\nsaddled with three personal fouls<br />\nand a miserable shooting<br />\npercentage at the half, could find<br />\nno better luck offensively in the<br />\nfinal twenty minutes. He ended<br />\nwith seven points on 3-for-19<br />\nfrom the floor and five fouls.<br />\nHowever, Jews' wait-and-see<br />\ndefensive work forced numerous<br />\nturnovers in the final period and<br />\nfreed Blue Jay center Chuck La<br />\nBerge for additional point<br />\nproduction. The 6'5\" senior from<br /><br />\nDallas, Pa., playing the finest<br />\ngame of his four year Hopkins<br />\ncareer, collected 22 points,<br />\nfourteen of these in the second<br />\nhalf.<br />\nThe second half comeback<br />\nculminated in a 75-75 tie with 28<br />\nseconds remaining. The Jays and<br />\nBees traded fouls to account for<br />\nthe final points of the game:<br />\nhowever, Hopkins finished off a<br />\n41 percent showing at the line<br />\nwith half of a one-on-one<br />\nopportunity, while B.U. sank a<br />\npair. The 77-76 loss sent the Blue<br />\nJays into the fifth place<br />\nconsolation against Loyola.<br />\nSeemingly not content with<br />\nthis performance, Hopkins'<br />\nCharles Street neighbors came<br />\nout firing last night. After<br />\nabsorbing a 51 point barrage in<br />\nthe first half the Jays regrouped<br />\nto come back. Trailing by as<br />\nmany as 18 points at 59-41,<br />\nBobby Freedman and Bill Jews<br />\nsparked a drive that brought the<br />\nteam to within two (68-66)<br />\nAt this point the Jays<br />\nreflected once again their lack of<br />\nstamina, hibernating for a full 41<br />\n/<br />\n2<br />\nminutes before John Rutter<br />\nbroke the spell. By this time it<br />\nwas too late, however, for Loyola<br />\nhad restored a twelve point lead<br />\nand needed merely to run out the<br />\nclock.<br /><br />\nMatmen appear strong in opener<br />\nBy CAT STEVENS<br />\nThe Blue Jay matmen rode to<br />\nLebanon Valley College for the<br />\nfirst tournament of the season<br />\nwith optimism and flew away<br />\nwith a strong fourth place finish<br />\nlast weekend. Of the nine men<br />\nwrestling for Hopkins, seven<br />\nplaced in the top four of their<br />\nweight class.<br />\n\"It was a great team<br />\nperformance!\" Coach Harry<br />\nGotwals remarked with elation.<br />\n\"It was the best showing by a<br />\nHopkins wrestling team in many<br />\nyears.\"<br />\nAlthough there were no<br />\nindividual winners, captain Neil<br />\nHazard and sophomore Gary<br />\nMurza took seconds. Third place<br />\nhonors were won by captain<br />\nClark Kingery, Ron Pucillo, Mike<br />\nPrivatera and Wayne Panullo.<br />\nDave Mulock finished in fourth<br />\nplace. The 84 team points<br />\nHopkins earned tripled last year's<br />\noutput.<br />\nMurza came closest to winning<br />\nbut in the heavyweight finals he<br />\nwas unable to execute a reversal<br />\non the 300 pound blob from<br /><br />\nDelaware Valley and lost in<br />\novertime. While Murza was<br />\nwinning 16 points for the team,<br />\nHazard garnered 161<br />\n/<br />\n2 in the 190<br />\nweight class.<br />\nHazard destroyed three<br />\nopponents on the way to his final<br />\nmatch. There he met Lebanon<br />\nValley's Sanko, who had one less<br />\nmatch. Fatigue took its toll and<br />\nHazard lost, 9-1.<br />\nPucillo, at 118, led the rush<br />\nfor third place. In amassing 11<br />\nteam points, Pucillo beat three<br />\nmen decisively, losing only to the<br />\neventual winner.<br />\nA gutty performance in the.<br />\nconsolation match capped a 101<br />\n/<br />\n2<br />\npoint binge by Privatera.
