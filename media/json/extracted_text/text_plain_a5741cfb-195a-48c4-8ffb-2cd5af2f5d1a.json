McCaul, Assistant<br />\nProfessor of Behavioral Biology<br />\nand Coordinator of the<br />\nAlcoholism Prevention Program<br />\nat the Johns Hopkins Hospital,<br />\nexplored the role of genetic inheritance in alcohol abuse cases<br />\nat the Brown Bag Lunch lecture<br />\non Monday. The lunch series<br />\nconsists of a number of informal<br />\nseminars as part of the Wellness<br />\nProgram sponsored by the JHU<br />\nSubstance Abuse Prevention<br />\n\u201eProgram.<br />\nIn recent years, the social<br />\nstigma that previously branded<br />\nalcoholics has become considerably less severe. A main<br />\nreason for this change of attitude<br />\nis that alcoholism is now<br />\nrecognized more as a medical<br />\nproblem rather than a personal<br />\nweakness. Consequently families<br />\nwith histories of problem drinking are more willing to open the<br />\ndoors to their family background.<br />\nPedigree is the basis for research<br />\nin the field of genetic influences<br />\non alcoholism.<br />\nAccording to McCaul, studies<br />\nhave confirmed that the incidence<br />\nof alcoholism is far greater in<br />\nfamilies with problem histories<br />\nthan in families without similar<br />\nbackgrounds. In fact, the incidence rate is five to eight times<br />\nhigher. \"But, it is difficult to<br />\nseparate environmental and<br />\ngenetic influences\", said Dr.<br />\nMcCaul. Therefore, in addition<br />\nto family studies, adoption studies<br />\nhave been made to compare the<br />\ndrinking habits of adopted<br />\nchildren to those of their<br />\nbiological families. The studies<br />\nalso show that biology is a key<br />\nfactor in the development of<br />\nalcoholism, especially in men.<br />\nMcCaul discussed three known<br />\ngenetic influences on alcoholism:<br />\ngender,<br />\npersonality<br />\ncharacteristics, and physiological<br />\ncharacteristics. Men are much<br />\nmore susceptible to the perils of<br />\nalcoholism than women are.<br />\nIn general, most of the research<br />\non alcohol has been done on male<br />\ncases only, because female cases<br />\nare few in number and difficult<br />\nto identify. In the tests, subjects<br />\nare matched according to age,<br />\nweight, height, and blood-alcohol<br />\nlevel.

Some people inherit a higher tolerance to<br />\nalcohol than others. \"People with<br />\na family history of alcoholism<br />\nhave to take a higher dose of<br />\nalcohol to achieve the same level<br />\n<br />\nof intoxication as 'normal people\", explained Dr. McCaul.<br />\nMcCaul stressed the fact that<br />\nnot all persons at risk develop the<br />\ndisease. Environmental influences also factor into<br />\nalcoholism. \"Genes are important, but not the whole store,\"<br />\nshe said. For example, if one twin<br />\nis an alcoholic, the probability of<br />\nthe other twin developing<br />\nalcoholism is only 50 to 60<br />\npercent.<br />\nOnly in recent years has<br />\ntypology been applied to<br />\nalcoholism, continued McCaul.<br />\nType 1 alcoholics, who are influenced by the environment,<br />\ntend to be guilt-ridden and know<br />\nthat they have a drinking problem. They usualy develop<br />\nalcoholism after the age of 25 and<br />\nbecome psychologically dependent on alcohol.

They are<br />\nfrequently involved in acts of<br />\nviolence and are constantly seeking alcohol.<br />\nAs a final note, McCaul<br />\npointed out that genetic influences<br />\nare similar in alcohol and drug<br />\nabuse.

Some<br />\nAmericans are really outraged<br />\nabout this, while others think<br />\n\"what a shame\" and don't give<br />\nit much more thought. Some people now refuse to buy Exxon<br />\ngasoline because of their callous<br />\nattitude about the clean-up<br />\n(just how clean is an \"environmentally stable\" beach,<br />\nanyway?). On the other hand, I'm<br />\nsure that somewhere there must<br />\nbe people who make a special effort to patronize Exxon now<br />\nbecause they hate environmentalists pestering the oil companies<br />\nall the time. It was quite interesting to talk with people in<br />\nAlaska and to read a few<br />\nnewspapers there this summer to<br />\nsee how those whom the spill affects the most are responding.<br />\nFirst of all, at least through<br />\nmid- July, the spill remained as<br />\nfront page news virtually every<br />\nday for the Anchorage Daily<br />\nNews. In a Sunday edition one<br />\ncould read numerous stories<br />\nabout the progress of the cleanup<br />\nand how mad the residents of<br />\nsmall coastal towns are. The<br />\ngeneral Alaska population really<br />\nhates oil companies these days.<br />\nFor example, many companies<br />\nhave experienced bomb threats on<br />\ntheir Anchorage office buildings<br />\nsince the spill. I'd say virtually<br />\neveryone up there has an anti-oil<br />\nattitude these days except the<br />\nemployees of oil companies. I<br />\nheard an awful lot of anti-oil talk<br />\naround Anchorage. As a result of<br />\nthis attitude, some companies<br />\nhave discussed moving their offices down to Seattle, which<br />\nwould not do well for the already<br />\nmediocre AnChorage economy.<br />\nOf course some Alaska natives<br />\nwould like to see this. They probably don't care what happens to<br />\nthe local economy. They would<br />\nlove to see the oil companies gone<br />\n<br />\nby Steve MacDuffle<br />\n<br />\nso Alaska can return to what it<br />\nonce was.., a bunch of rugged individualists living a clean life in<br />\nan often harsh but unspoiled environment. These people hate the<br />\ngovernment or anybody who tries<br />\nto tell them what they can or can't<br />\ndo. One thing these people may<br />\nbe forgetting is the rather nice tax<br />\nbenefits in Alaska. Because the<br />\nstate collects so many tax dollars<br />\nfrom the oil companies, Alaska<br />\nhas no income tax.<br />\nCertainly the people most affected by this oil spill are the<br />\ncommercial fishermen. The sole<br />\nsource of income for many of<br />\nthese people was simply<br />\nunavailable this year. They have<br />\na right to be incensed, but Exxon has tried to pacify them. Exxon has shelled out enormous<br />\namounts of cash to these people,<br />\nbasically \"hush money\" so they<br />\nwill not raise such a ruckus about<br />\nthe whole thing. It would be nice<br />\nif the fishing and oil industries<br />\ncould coexist. If double-hulled<br />\ntankers are put to use along with<br />\ngreater safety precautions and<br />\nspill preparedness, all nice extras<br />\nwhich Exxon and the other companies choose to pass on, then it<br />\nshould be possible for fishing to<br />\ncoexist with the transport of oil<br />\nthrough the same water. But drilling seems to another issue.<br />\nBristol Bay is a large body of<br />\nwater in southwest Alaska, between the mainland and the Aleutian chain. This bay has some<br />\nwonderfully productive salmon<br />\nfishing areas.

He's known as \"Johnny<br />\nHandsome,\" a New Orleans criminal who bears<br />\nsome resemblance to the deformed Vincent on<br />\nCBS-TV's \"Beauty and the Beast.\" Johnny's<br />\nfeatures, we learn, were passed to him genetically from his drug-addicted mother.<br />\nTo make us feel some pity for Johnny, whose<br />\nappearance is truly gruesome, Hill and screenwriter Ken Friedman produce some criminals who<br />\nmake him look angelic by comparison. The sluttish Sunny Boyd (Ellen Barkin) and her partner<br />\nRafe Garrett(Lance Henrikson) set up Johnny and<br />\nhis henchmen in a coin heist, after which Johnny<br />\nends up in prison, his friends murdered.<br />\nAfter he is stabbed in prison, Johnny meets<br />\nStephen Resher (Forest Whitaker), a doctor who<br />\npromises him a new identity and a new face. After<br />\na pair of improbable operations, Johnny's ap-<br />\n<br />\npearance is completely normal. After he regains<br />\nthe power to speak, he is paroled. He then gets<br />\na job and meets a girl. Despite Resher's dubious<br />\nwarnings before the operations (\"Don't expect<br />\nmiracles\"), Johnny seems a new person.<br />\nThe first part of \"Johnny Handsome\"\u2014before<br />\nJohnny gets his new face\u2014is disjointed and uncomfortably deliberate. The audience knows that<br />\nJohnny will eventually look like Rourke: Hill's<br />\ndetailed coverage of the operations seems<br />\nsuperfluous. In these scenes the film moves slowly, adding little to the plot and fracturing Hill's<br />\nneat, story-like structure.<br />\nAnd since the story is such a simple one, Hill<br />\nintroduces his characters with scant dialogue and<br />\nbackground information. The film's opening<br />\ncredits, in fact, are interspersed with brief scenes<br />\nthat set up and run through the first robbery. It's<br />\na jarring technique, but Hill makes it work.<br />\nFollowing his surgery, Johnny's criminal streak<br />\npersists: he plans a new robbery to vindicate the<br />\ngroup of friends killed earlier in the film. What's<br />\nbred in Johnny's bones will indeed not out his<br />\nflesh; this is one of \"Johnny Handsome\"s most<br />\nprominent themes. Johnny has a new face and a<br />\nnew life to lead, but it's as if he's acting it\u2014like<br />\nthe whole thing is make-believe. As before, he<br />\nis constantly planning and plotting.<br />\nAbsorbing this duality isn't easy in \"Johnny<br />\n<br />\nCourtesy of Tri-Star Pictures<br />\n<br />\nEllen Barkin and Mickey Rourke in Walter Hill's accomplished new drama, \"Johnny Handsome.\"<br />\n<br />\nHandsome,\" for not only are his personas distinct,<br />\nthey are constantly being reinterpreted and shaped<br />\nby the others in the film. The aptly-named A.Z.<br />\nDrones (Morgan Freeman), an easygoing New<br />\nOrleans police lieutenant, shadows Johnny<br />\nthroughout the film, unconvinced that he has<br />\nmended his ways. Drones wanders in and out of<br />\nthe film like a pest, but his nuggets of cynicism<br />\nresonate: at film's end, they seem almost<br />\nprescient.<br />\nJohnny's girlfriend Donna (Elizabeth<br />\nMcGovern) is naive and almost dull-witted: she<br />\ndoesn't understand why he has become so evasive.<br />\n\"Don't do this to yourself,\" she yells to him, but<br />\n<br />\nNext Wednesday, Oct. 4,<br />\nthe University Office of<br />\nSpecial Events will show a collection of award-winning commercials from the United<br />\nStates and abroad.

Deciphering his criminal<br />\nmind is challenge enough without this unneccessary veil. Did Johnny's deformity turn him into<br />\na criminal? Hill never explores this.

Still, she knows the ins and outs of the city, and helps the two detectives stay afloat.<br />\nConklin's and Vincent's foibles are well<br />\ndocumented, as are the butcherings of English by<br />\nthe bumbling Osaka police. But when it appears<br />\nthat \"Black Rain\" is on the verge of camp, it takes<br />\na redeeming turn toward bleakness. To give the<br />\ncurveball away would be unfair. Suffice to say that<br />\nit involves Sato's evil band of bosozuku in a<br />\nvigorously directed sequence.<br />\nAt this point in the film, Conklin has revenge<br />\nto motivate him, and the film picks up. But there's<br />\ntoo much going on, and \"Black Rain\" runs out<br />\nof gas in the home stretch. As Conklin and Sato<br />\ncome to their inevitable final confrontation, we<br />\nare stuffed with subplots and themes; we've no<br />\nroom for another helping.

Andy<br />\nGarcia, however, turns in the film's best performance: he really acts here\u2014a luxury his earlier<br />\nrole in \"The Untouchables\" didn't allow. As Vin-<br />\n<br />\nJOHNNY HANDSOME<br />\n<br />\ncent, he is funny, attractive, and endearing.<br />\nMuch was expected of Kate Capshaw in \"Black<br />\nRain,\" but she's a major disappointment; her part<br />\nis badly underwritten.

The squares vary in<br />\nnumber, layout, and proximity to<br />\neach other, but you are concerned only with their color. You<br />\npress one key when all squares<br />\nare green, and another if one<br />\nsquare is pink. The session lasts<br />\nforty minutes.<br />\nThis experiment is currently<br />\nbeing conducted by Dr. Howard<br />\nEgeth of the Johns Hopkins<br />\npsychology department. Egeth, a<br />\nspecialist in human perception<br />\nand attention, is using the test to<br />\nstudy the form of visual perception known as pre-attention.<br />\nPerception is the process by<br />\nwhich we gather information<br />\nfrom the environment and represent it in the mind. Pre-attention<br />\nis a rudimentary form of perception which we use when<br />\ndistinguishing between obviously dissimilar objects, like X's and<br />\nO's, or squares of green and<br />\npink.<br />\n\"The pre-attentive process controls the 'pop-out' phenomenon,\"<br />\n<br />\nsays Egeth, \"as when a certain<br />\nshape or color pops off the page<br />\nto catch the viewer's eye.\" A different system, the attentive process, is called upon when making subtle discriminations or performing combined tasks, like finding a red 0 amid red X's and<br />\ngreen O's.<br />\nPre-attention, Egeth adds, is<br />\nalso \"the system that keeps us<br />\nfrom bumping into furniture<br />\nwithout even noticing what the<br />\nfurniture is, or that we almost<br />\nbumped into it.\" It functions<br />\nbelow our level of awareness<br />\nwhile we think of other things.<br />\nThe attentive system, in contrast,<br />\nrequires the full concentration of<br />\nthe mind.<br />\nEgeth believes that the<br />\npreliminary results of his coloredsquared experiment refute a<br />\ntheory recently advanced by Bell<br />\nLaboratory psychologist Bela<br />\nJulesz. According to Julesz, the<br />\nperceptive power of pre-attention<br />\nvaries with the proximity and<br />\nsimilarity of the objects to be<br />\ndistinguished. Pre-attention processing is impaired as the objects<br />\nare moved farther or made to appear more similar.<br />\nEgeth's study, however, shows<br />\nno correlation between accuracy<br />\nof perception and proximity of<br />\n<br />\nthe colored squares.<br />\nEgeth believes that although<br />\nJulesz's theory, known as the<br />\nfeature-gradient theory, may be<br />\nvalid for certain situations, it cannot be applied generally to the<br />\npre-attentive system. Having<br />\ntested dozens of subjects already,<br />\nhe considers the results conclusive. \"In this situation,\" he<br />\navers, \"Julesz's theory fails.\"<br />\nThe results instead support<br />\nanother theory, the feature-map<br />\nmodel, which proposes that people carry in their minds countless<br />\nmaps \"like little sheets in the cortex\": black/white, straight/curved, flat/solid, etc. According to<br />\nthis model, Egeth's test subjects<br />\nactivate mental green and pink<br />\nmaps and compare it to each pattern flashed across the screen. All<br />\nother maps, such as those concerning the proximity, number, and<br />\norientation of squares, would remain dormant.<br />\nThis model also explains why<br />\ncombined, or conjoint, tasks require the attentive system: when<br />\nsearching for a red 0,for example, in a field of both red X's and<br />\nblack O's, the mind must switch<br />\nrepeatedly between the red/black<br />\nmap and the X/O map, mentally<br />\nholding each map up beside each<br />\nletter in a process too<br />\n<br />\nSAVE needs you<br />\nto test vaccine<br />\nby Sharyn Horowitz<br />\nThis week, the News-Letter is<br />\nrunning a strange ad: \"If you<br />\nhave never had a smallpox vaccination,\" it says,\"we need you<br />\nto help fight AIDS!\" The Center<br />\nfor Immunization Research, at<br />\nthe Johns Hopkins Hospital, has<br />\nturned to college campuses to find<br />\nhealthy, HIV-negative individuals<br />\nwilling to help test a vaccine for<br />\nAIDS.<br />\nAIDS, like all infections,<br />\nbegins with some infectious agent<br />\ngetting into the body. Once inside, they produce toxic<br />\nsubstances which poison the<br />\nbody, as is the case with<br />\npneumonia. Or, they take control<br />\nof cells, use them to reproduce at<br />\nincredible rates, and then blow<br />\nthem up. This second tactic is used by viruses. The sooner the infectious agent is destroyed, the<br />\nless damage it does.<br />\nThe body's defense is the immune system, a sophisticated and<br />\ncomplex battery of cells and proteins designed to recognize and<br />\ndestroy foreign agents. The immune system begins to work by<br />\nproducing antibodies, proteins<br />\nwhich recognize something about<br />\nthe infectious agent, and stick to<br />\nit. Other parts of the immune<br />\nsystem recognize the antibody<br />\nand destroy it and whatever is attached to it. But the production<br />\nof antibodies is just slow enough<br />\nto allow some damage to be done.<br />\nThe principle behind vaccines,<br />\nsuch as those to prevent diptheria,<br />\ntetanus, chicken pox, and the flu,<br />\nis simply to be prepared. The<br />\nvaccine for each of these infections is a section of the diseasecausing organism's DNA or<br />\nRNA. The part is carefully<br />\nselected to include only harmless'<br />\n<br />\ngenes, genes that produce innocuous proteins for the agent's<br />\ncoat.<br />\nAfter the vaccine is administered, the vaccine's genes<br />\nensconce themselves in the recipient's own genes. They produce<br />\ntheir protein, and the protein<br />\nbegins to circulate in the<br />\nbloodstream. Antibodies form,<br />\nstick to the protein, and engineer<br />\nits destruction. Once the immune<br />\nsystem has been primed'to produce a certain antibody, it can<br />\nproduce it much more quickly<br />\nwhen the need arises again.<br />\nVaccines are extremely<br />\neffective\u2014they have changed<br />\ndiseases like polio and smallpox<br />\nfrom widespread epidemics into<br />\npractically extinct diseases. The<br />\nneed for an effective vaccine for<br />\nAIDS is tremendous as HIV is<br />\ndevious. After initial infection,<br />\nHIV is active for only a few<br />\nweeks, causing what appears to<br />\nbe a slight case of the flu. Then,<br />\nit hides itself within immune<br />\nsystem cells, before enough antibodies to destroy it can be produced. HIV lies dormant for<br />\nmonths or years, then comes out<br />\nin force to destroy the victim's<br />\nimmune system.<br />\nIf there were HIV antibodies<br />\nalready prepared, when HIV<br />\nentered the body it would be<br />\ndestroyed. The Center for Immunization Research (CIR) has<br />\nbeen selected to participate in a<br />\nsix-center, National Institute of<br />\nHealth study of a promising vaccine, HIVAC-le. CIR has started<br />\na group to focus on the search for<br />\nan AIDS vaccine, Project SAVE<br />\n(Support the AIDS vaccine Effort). Five people have already<br />\nbeen<br />\ninnoculated<br />\nwith<br />\nHIVAC- le, and one year later,<br />\nthey are all doing well.<br />\n<br />\nSAVE is currently looking for<br />\nvolunteers to help determine what<br />\nis the safest and most effective<br />\ndose of HIVAC- le. The concern<br />\nfor safety is not about subjects<br />\ngetting AIDS\u2014that cannot happen since there is no HIV in the<br />\nvaccine, only a single, harmless<br />\ngene copied from it. They are<br />\nmerely finding out how much<br />\nvaccine will cause production of<br />\nantibodies, and how much will<br />\ncause adverse reactions. The<br />\nadverse reaction can be the same<br />\nas those with other vaccines:<br />\nsoreness at the point of injection,<br />\nfever, chills, rash, and fatigue.<br />\nEach potential volunteer will<br />\nhave three visits before the injection is given. During these visits,<br />\nCIR staff will draw blood and<br />\ntake urine and skin samples to<br />\nscreen for HIV infection and<br />\nother abnormalities, and will inform subjects of the results of the<br />\nHIV test. They will ask questions<br />\nabout drug use and sexual<br />\nbehavior to determine your risk<br />\nof contracting HIV, since they are<br />\nlooking for low-risk individuals.<br />\nThe injection itself will be of<br />\neither HIVAC- le or plain<br />\nsmallpox vaccine. The volunteers<br />\nwill be followed up for at least<br />\none year, with approximately ten<br />\noffice visits. For each visit, from<br />\nscreening to final follow-up, the<br />\nvolunteers will receive some<br />\ncompensation.<br />\nThe point of vaccines is to<br />\nmake antibodies, so recipients<br />\nwill register HIV-antibody<br />\npositive when tested.

The loss evens<br />\nthe Blue Jays' record at three<br />\nwins and three losses.<br />\n\"Our team is so much better<br />\nthan what we showed here,\" said<br />\nHopkins coach Bill Jones. \"I<br />\nthink we're better than the<br />\nDickinson team. That's the sad<br />\npart.\"<br />\n<br />\nThe Blue Jays committed 26<br />\nunforced errors in the match that<br />\nlasted just more than an hour.<br />\nJones listed bad serves, poor hitting coverage, and weak shot<br />\nplacement among the problems<br />\nthat plagued the team. \"There<br />\nwasn't one area where we played<br />\nreally well. In short, we beat<br />\nourselves,\"said Jones.<br />\nDickinson took an early lead in<br />\nall three games. In the first game,<br />\nthe Blue Jays pulled to within two<br />\npoints at 11-13, after having trailed 7-12. The Red'Devils captured<br />\nthe following two points and the<br />\name.<br />\n<br />\nIn the second game, Hopkins<br />\nwas unable to rebound from an<br />\noverwhelming 2-11 deficit<br />\ndespite two long volleys which<br />\nprovided a glimpse of the team's<br />\ntalent. The third game saw the<br />\nBlue Jays tie the score at 7-7, only<br />\nto be shut out by the Red Devils<br />\nfor the remainder of the game.<br />\nDickinson boosted its record to<br />\n10-4. Most importantly, the victory raised the Red Devils' record<br />\nto 4-1 in the Middle Atlantic Conference (MAC). The Blue Jays'<br />\nMAC record stands at 0-2.<br />\nThe loss was disheartening<br />\nbecause it came on the heels of<br />\n<br />\na strong, consistent performance.<br />\nat the Gettysburg Tournament. In<br />\naddition, it took place in front of<br />\na home crowd. \"It was a hard<br />\nloss for them.

Miller explained that Barnes and Noble's<br />\ncontract with the University has<br />\nbeen renewed unquestionably<br />\nsince 1981. No bids have ever<br />\nbeen submitted or requested from<br />\nother competitors. \"With the<br />\nfinancial situation of the University as it is, it might not be advisable for them (to accept<br />\nbids),\" said Stewart.<br />\nMiller refused to disclose any<br />\nterms of the current contract. She<br />\nalso explained that the contract in<br />\neffect prior to 1981 with a former<br />\ncompany was unavailable at the<br />\ntime.<br />\nStudent Council president Lou<br />\nGiangiulio asserted that extras,<br />\nincluding school supplies,<br />\nclothing and the like, not textbooks, are Barnes and Noble's<br />\nbest source of income. Additionally, he explained that the<br />\nbuy-back policy also produces income for the bookstore.<br />\nThe concern with the buy-back<br />\npolicy, in particular, elicited<br />\nvarious suggestions on how to<br />\ndeal with the situation.

Christiano wrote a<br />\nletter to the News-Letter last week<br />\nasserting that she had been lied<br />\nto by Andrea Perry. She's seen<br />\nnothing within the past week that<br />\nwould convince her otherwise,<br />\nshe said.<br />\nBesides the general state of<br />\nmistrust between Building B<br />\nresidents and the Residential Life<br />\noffice, there is also a feeling,<br />\namong some residents, that the<br />\nresignation itself had been<br />\nmismanaged by the office.<br /><br />\n\"It's unanimous.

The fraternity would<br />\nalso need to perform community<br />\nservice, including two semesters<br />\nof driving a security van and<br />\nsponsoring a speaker.<br />\nKaplan said he felt the punishment imposed by the grievance<br /><br />\nboard was justified.<br />\nMike Hendrick, president of<br />\nATO, disagreed.<br />\n\"I don't think the punishment<br />\nfits the grievance at all,\" Hendrick said. \"The punishment was<br />\nsevere and not in balance with<br />\nprevious grievances and<br />\npunishments.\"<br />\nHendrick and Lisak say they<br />\nboth recall incidences of pledges<br />\nbeing handcuffed and sent<br />\nthrough the dorms on scavenger<br />\nhunts.<br />\n\"In looking at the punishment<br />\nwe received for 15 minutes of<br />\njumping jacks,\" Lisak said, \"I'm<br />\nnot sure that the punishment we<br />\ngot is fair.\"<br />\nThe IFC rules on hazing, based partly on Maryland state laws,<br />\nare,'word-for-word', the same as<br />\nthe text of ATO's Risk Management insurance policy.<br />\nThe rules, however, leave<br />\nmuch room for interpretation,<br />\nsaid Hendrick. \"The bylaws are<br />\nso open-ended that anything can<br />\nbe considered hazing,\" Hendrick<br />\nsaid. \"Making the pledges watch<br />\na video on hazing is, by IFC<br />\nlaws, hazing. To a certain extent,<br />\nthen, every fraternity hazes.\"<br />\nIn addition to the charges of<br />\nhazing and defaming the Greek<br />\nsystem, ATO also faced the<br />\ncharge of sexual harrassment.<br />\nThe grievance board found ATO<br />\ninnocent on that count after the<br />\nSee ATO, 2<br /><br />\nElisse Takara<br /><br />\nthe<br />\nthat<br />\nLee<br />\nfeels<br />\nKaplan,<br />\nIFC<br />\nPresident,<br />\npunishment imposed by the grievance board concerning ATO's<br />\nviolations was justified.<br /><br />\nFederal authorities are investigating whether Hopkins has<br />\ncolluded with any of the other 51<br />\nschools also currently under investigation, including the<br />\nmembers of the Ivy League and<br />\nsome of the most selective colleges and universities in the country. If found guilty, Hopkins<br />\ncould receive a federal injunction<br />\nthat would require it to alter its<br />\ncurrent tuition and financial aid<br />\npractices. An injunction would<br />\nmake the University ripe to<br />\nreceive a barrage of class-action<br />\nlawsuits by past and present<br />\nstudents and faculty members.<br />\nThe government's investigation<br />\nbegan late this summer when the<br />\nDepartment solicited documentation concerning alleged collusion<br />\nto 'fix' tuition and financial aid<br />\nprices on the part of the Ivy's and<br />\nseveral selective northeastern<br />\nprivate colleges. A major focus<br />\nof the inquiry is believed to be the<br />\npractices of two associations of<br />\nthese colleges, the \"Ivy Overlap<br />\nGroup\" and the \"Pentagonal/Sisters Group,\" which<br />\nseek to alleviate disparities in<br />\nfinancial aid awards granted by<br />\nmember institutions.<br />\nThe \"Ivy Overlap Group,\" the<br />\nIvy League colleges and M.I.T.,<br />\nand the \"Pentagonal/Sisters<br />\nGroup,\" Amherst, Barnard,<br />\nBowdoin, Bryn Mawr, Colby,<br />\nMount Holyoke, Middlebury,<br />\nVassar,<br />\nSmith, Trinity,<br />\nWellesley, Wesleyan, and<br />\nWilliams Colleges, meet annually<br />\nin early April to review on an individual case basis the financial<br />\nneed of each applicant who has<br />\nreceived an acceptance to more<br />\nthan one of these schools.<br />\nThe intent of these colleges is<br />\nto reduce the disparities in financial aid packages between the<br />\nschools when students receive acceptance letters in mid-April. The<br />\nstudent can then choose the<br />\nschool he or she would most like<br />\nto attend without being influenced by competing financial<br />\npressures. In fact, what actually<br />\noccurs is that the schools seek to<br />\nstandardize an individual student's \"out-of-pocket\" tuition<br />\nexpense. Each school then builds<br />\nits own financial aid package<br />\naround this.<br />\nIt is this practice of the standardization of a student's family's<br />\n\"out-of-pocket\" contribution that<br />\nhas come under extreme fire from<br />\nother college administrators and<br />\nis under investigation by the<br />\nDepartment of Justice and the<br />\nFederal Trade Commission.<br />\nWhile these colleges justify this<br />\npractice as being to the ultimate<br />\nbenefit of the student, it is alleged to have artificially deflated the<br />\naward that an individual student<br />\nmight otherwise have received,<br />\nthus making it an \"illegal combination in restraint of trade\"<br />\nunder the Sherman Antitrust Act.<br />\nThe government might only<br />\nseek a civil injunction preventing<br />\nthese schools from continuing this<br />\npractice, under Section 4 of the<br />\nClayton Act, according to Justice<br />\nSee Price, 3<br /><br />\n2/SEPTEMBER 29, 1989<br /><br />\nATO<br />\nplans<br />\nto appeal<br />\nIFC ruling<br /><br />\nSunday Experience addresses<br />\n'crisis of belief' in the USSR<br /><br />\n1<br /><br />\nby Alex Pham<br /><br />\nATO, from 1<br />\nfraternity produced witnesses attesting that they saw nothing<br />\nwhich could be interpreted as sexually offensive.<br />\n\"We're really angry about this<br />\nbecause just being accused of sexual harassment is a serious<br />\nthing,\" Hendrick said. ''The IFC<br />\nshould have looked into this<br />\nbefore associating us with this<br />\ncharge.

McCaul, Assistant<br />\nProfessor of Behavioral Biology<br />\nand Coordinator of the<br />\nAlcoholism Prevention Program<br />\nat the Johns Hopkins Hospital,<br />\nexplored the role of genetic inheritance in alcohol abuse cases<br />\nat the Brown Bag Lunch lecture<br />\non Monday. The lunch series<br />\nconsists of a number of informal<br />\nseminars as part of the Wellness<br />\nProgram sponsored by the JHU<br />\nSubstance Abuse Prevention<br />\n\u201eProgram.<br />\nIn recent years, the social<br />\nstigma that previously branded<br />\nalcoholics has become considerably less severe. A main<br />\nreason for this change of attitude<br />\nis that alcoholism is now<br />\nrecognized more as a medical<br />\nproblem rather than a personal<br />\nweakness. Consequently families<br />\nwith histories of problem drinking are more willing to open the<br />\ndoors to their family background.<br />\nPedigree is the basis for research<br />\nin the field of genetic influences<br />\non alcoholism.<br />\nAccording to McCaul, studies<br />\nhave confirmed that the incidence<br />\nof alcoholism is far greater in<br />\nfamilies with problem histories<br />\nthan in families without similar<br />\nbackgrounds. In fact, the incidence rate is five to eight times<br />\nhigher. \"But, it is difficult to<br />\nseparate environmental and<br />\ngenetic influences\", said Dr.<br />\nMcCaul. Therefore, in addition<br />\nto family studies, adoption studies<br />\nhave been made to compare the<br />\ndrinking habits of adopted<br />\nchildren to those of their<br />\nbiological families. The studies<br />\nalso show that biology is a key<br />\nfactor in the development of<br />\nalcoholism, especially in men.<br />\nMcCaul discussed three known<br />\ngenetic influences on alcoholism:<br />\ngender,<br />\npersonality<br />\ncharacteristics, and physiological<br />\ncharacteristics. Men are much<br />\nmore susceptible to the perils of<br />\nalcoholism than women are.<br />\nIn general, most of the research<br />\non alcohol has been done on male<br />\ncases only, because female cases<br />\nare few in number and difficult<br />\nto identify. In the tests, subjects<br />\nare matched according to age,<br />\nweight, height, and blood-alcohol<br />\nlevel.

Some people inherit a higher tolerance to<br />\nalcohol than others. \"People with<br />\na family history of alcoholism<br />\nhave to take a higher dose of<br />\nalcohol to achieve the same level<br /><br />\nof intoxication as 'normal people\", explained Dr. McCaul.<br />\nMcCaul stressed the fact that<br />\nnot all persons at risk develop the<br />\ndisease. Environmental influences also factor into<br />\nalcoholism. \"Genes are important, but not the whole store,\"<br />\nshe said. For example, if one twin<br />\nis an alcoholic, the probability of<br />\nthe other twin developing<br />\nalcoholism is only 50 to 60<br />\npercent.<br />\nOnly in recent years has<br />\ntypology been applied to<br />\nalcoholism, continued McCaul.<br />\nType 1 alcoholics, who are influenced by the environment,<br />\ntend to be guilt-ridden and know<br />\nthat they have a drinking problem. They usualy develop<br />\nalcoholism after the age of 25 and<br />\nbecome psychologically dependent on alcohol. Type 2<br />\nalcoholics, characterized by<br />\nfamily background of alcoholism<br />\nand ASP, develop alcoholism<br /><br />\nbefore the age of 25. They are<br />\nfrequently involved in acts of<br />\nviolence and are constantly seeking alcohol.<br />\nAs a final note, McCaul<br />\npointed out that genetic influences<br />\nare similar in alcohol and drug<br />\nabuse.

Some<br />\nAmericans are really outraged<br />\nabout this, while others think<br />\n\"what a shame\" and don't give<br />\nit much more thought. Some people now refuse to buy Exxon<br />\ngasoline because of their callous<br />\nattitude about the clean-up<br />\n(just how clean is an \"environmentally stable\" beach,<br />\nanyway?). On the other hand, I'm<br />\nsure that somewhere there must<br />\nbe people who make a special effort to patronize Exxon now<br />\nbecause they hate environmentalists pestering the oil companies<br />\nall the time. It was quite interesting to talk with people in<br />\nAlaska and to read a few<br />\nnewspapers there this summer to<br />\nsee how those whom the spill affects the most are responding.<br />\nFirst of all, at least through<br />\nmid- July, the spill remained as<br />\nfront page news virtually every<br />\nday for the Anchorage Daily<br />\nNews. In a Sunday edition one<br />\ncould read numerous stories<br />\nabout the progress of the cleanup<br />\nand how mad the residents of<br />\nsmall coastal towns are. The<br />\ngeneral Alaska population really<br />\nhates oil companies these days.<br />\nFor example, many companies<br />\nhave experienced bomb threats on<br />\ntheir Anchorage office buildings<br />\nsince the spill. I'd say virtually<br />\neveryone up there has an anti-oil<br />\nattitude these days except the<br />\nemployees of oil companies. I<br />\nheard an awful lot of anti-oil talk<br />\naround Anchorage. As a result of<br />\nthis attitude, some companies<br />\nhave discussed moving their offices down to Seattle, which<br />\nwould not do well for the already<br />\nmediocre AnChorage economy.<br />\nOf course some Alaska natives<br />\nwould like to see this.

These people hate the<br />\ngovernment or anybody who tries<br />\nto tell them what they can or can't<br />\ndo. One thing these people may<br />\nbe forgetting is the rather nice tax<br />\nbenefits in Alaska. Because the<br />\nstate collects so many tax dollars<br />\nfrom the oil companies, Alaska<br />\nhas no income tax.<br />\nCertainly the people most affected by this oil spill are the<br />\ncommercial fishermen. The sole<br />\nsource of income for many of<br />\nthese people was simply<br />\nunavailable this year. They have<br />\na right to be incensed, but Exxon has tried to pacify them. Exxon has shelled out enormous<br />\namounts of cash to these people,<br />\nbasically \"hush money\" so they<br />\nwill not raise such a ruckus about<br />\nthe whole thing. It would be nice<br />\nif the fishing and oil industries<br />\ncould coexist.

But drilling seems to another issue.<br />\nBristol Bay is a large body of<br />\nwater in southwest Alaska, between the mainland and the Aleutian chain. This bay has some<br />\nwonderfully productive salmon<br />\nfishing areas.

And<br />\nall of you who buy the pre-mixed<br />\nmicrowave kind are just no fun.<br />\nBut even the chocolatey<br />\ngoodness of basic brownies can<br />\nbe improved upon. This recipe<br />\nalmost raises brownies to the<br />\nlevel of gourmet. But be assured,<br />\nthe recipe is simple, unpretentious, and perfect for a party (the<br />\nkind where you actually serve<br />\nfood) or departmental picnic.<br /><br />\nThey are great when you are in<br />\na creative mood and want to hear<br />\nthe oohs and aahs of your friends.<br />\nI suppose you could make<br />\nbrownie batter from scratch, but<br />\nit's more time-consuming. I use<br />\na mix. My favorite is Giant<br />\nBrownie Mix because it is good<br />\nand fudgy, and most importantly, cheap. Some with \"more<br />\nrefined\" palates don't care for<br />\nGiant, so if you want the top-ofthe-line brownie mix, I recommend Betty Crocker, with the can<br />\nof Hershey's syrup in the<br />\npackage. But only use a basic<br />\nbrownie mix; avoid those with<br />\ncaramel, truffle, or chocolate<br />\nchips for this recipe.<br /><br />\nAfter taking first place in the<br />\nregional competition, Circle K<br />\nwon an honorable mention for its<br />\nnewsletter, Hopkins Happenings.<br />\nRecording Secretary Jack Horn,<br />\nwho edited the paper last year,<br />\nwas surprised with its success.<br />\nThey had no idea what the other<br />\nentrants<br />\nlike.<br />\nwere<br />\n\"We did know that we put our<br />\nheart into it, even though we<br />\ndidn't think we would win,\" says<br />\nJack.<br />\nBilling itself as \"an international service organization, sponsored by Kiwanis, whose main<br />\npurpose is to serve the community and the campus through<br />\ncharities and fund raisers,\" they<br />\nare affiliated with over 700 other<br />\ncollege clubs.<br />\nThis year Circle K continues its<br /><br />\nConfetti Brownies<br />\nIngredients:<br /><br />\nCircle K schedules<br />\nvariety of activities<br />\nCIRCLE K, from 8<br /><br />\nYou can use your imagination to see the colorful confetti topping or you can make these easy brownies yourself.<br /><br />\nObrownie mix<br />\nDeggs, as specified by the<br />\nbrownie mix<br /><br />\nagenda under new president JenOvegetable oil, whatever the<br />\nnie Morgan.

But this simple and refreshing film, directed<br />\nby Walter Hill, exudes a quiet confidence as it unfolds. Like a good short story, \"Johnny Handsome\" isn't afraid to reveal its structure for fear<br />\nof losing our interest. Initially unappealing, it earns<br />\nour trust and rewards our patience.<br />\nJohn Gedley (Mickey Rourke) is the victim of<br />\na massive cranial disfigurement: his jaw and skull<br />\nare grotesquely large. He's known as \"Johnny<br />\nHandsome,\" a New Orleans criminal who bears<br />\nsome resemblance to the deformed Vincent on<br />\nCBS-TV's \"Beauty and the Beast.\" Johnny's<br />\nfeatures, we learn, were passed to him genetically from his drug-addicted mother.<br />\nTo make us feel some pity for Johnny, whose<br />\nappearance is truly gruesome, Hill and screenwriter Ken Friedman produce some criminals who<br />\nmake him look angelic by comparison. The sluttish Sunny Boyd (Ellen Barkin) and her partner<br />\nRafe Garrett(Lance Henrikson) set up Johnny and<br />\nhis henchmen in a coin heist, after which Johnny<br />\nends up in prison, his friends murdered.<br />\nAfter he is stabbed in prison, Johnny meets<br />\nStephen Resher (Forest Whitaker), a doctor who<br />\npromises him a new identity and a new face. After<br />\na pair of improbable operations, Johnny's ap-<br /><br />\npearance is completely normal. After he regains<br />\nthe power to speak, he is paroled. He then gets<br />\na job and meets a girl. Despite Resher's dubious<br />\nwarnings before the operations (\"Don't expect<br />\nmiracles\"), Johnny seems a new person.<br />\nThe first part of \"Johnny Handsome\"\u2014before<br />\nJohnny gets his new face\u2014is disjointed and uncomfortably deliberate. The audience knows that<br />\nJohnny will eventually look like Rourke: Hill's<br />\ndetailed coverage of the operations seems<br />\nsuperfluous. In these scenes the film moves slowly, adding little to the plot and fracturing Hill's<br />\nneat, story-like structure.<br />\nAnd since the story is such a simple one, Hill<br />\nintroduces his characters with scant dialogue and<br />\nbackground information. The film's opening<br />\ncredits, in fact, are interspersed with brief scenes<br />\nthat set up and run through the first robbery. It's<br />\na jarring technique, but Hill makes it work.<br />\nFollowing his surgery, Johnny's criminal streak<br />\npersists: he plans a new robbery to vindicate the<br />\ngroup of friends killed earlier in the film. What's<br />\nbred in Johnny's bones will indeed not out his<br />\nflesh; this is one of \"Johnny Handsome\"s most<br />\nprominent themes. Johnny has a new face and a<br />\nnew life to lead, but it's as if he's acting it\u2014like<br />\nthe whole thing is make-believe. As before, he<br />\nis constantly planning and plotting.<br />\nAbsorbing this duality isn't easy in \"Johnny<br /><br />\nCourtesy of Tri-Star Pictures<br /><br />\nEllen Barkin and Mickey Rourke in Walter Hill's accomplished new drama, \"Johnny Handsome.\"<br /><br />\nHandsome,\" for not only are his personas distinct,<br />\nthey are constantly being reinterpreted and shaped<br />\nby the others in the film. The aptly-named A.Z.<br />\nDrones (Morgan Freeman), an easygoing New<br />\nOrleans police lieutenant, shadows Johnny<br />\nthroughout the film, unconvinced that he has<br />\nmended his ways. Drones wanders in and out of<br />\nthe film like a pest, but his nuggets of cynicism<br />\nresonate: at film's end, they seem almost<br />\nprescient.<br />\nJohnny's girlfriend Donna (Elizabeth<br />\nMcGovern) is naive and almost dull-witted: she<br />\ndoesn't understand why he has become so evasive.<br />\n\"Don't do this to yourself,\" she yells to him, but<br /><br />\nNext Wednesday, Oct. 4,<br />\nthe University Office of<br />\nSpecial Events will show a collection of award-winning commercials from the United<br />\nStates and abroad.

Deciphering his criminal<br />\nmind is challenge enough without this unneccessary veil. Did Johnny's deformity turn him into<br />\na criminal? Hill never explores this. Rourke's effective portrayal of Johnny captures the faces<br /><br />\nRIDE, from 10<br />\nKingsley (Kate Capshaw) is from Chicago, and<br />\nshe meets Conklin's naivete with lashes of sarcasm. Still, she knows the ins and outs of the city, and helps the two detectives stay afloat.<br />\nConklin's and Vincent's foibles are well<br />\ndocumented, as are the butcherings of English by<br />\nthe bumbling Osaka police. But when it appears<br />\nthat \"Black Rain\" is on the verge of camp, it takes<br />\na redeeming turn toward bleakness. To give the<br />\ncurveball away would be unfair. Suffice to say that<br />\nit involves Sato's evil band of bosozuku in a<br />\nvigorously directed sequence.<br />\nAt this point in the film, Conklin has revenge<br />\nto motivate him, and the film picks up. But there's<br />\ntoo much going on, and \"Black Rain\" runs out<br />\nof gas in the home stretch. As Conklin and Sato<br />\ncome to their inevitable final confrontation, we<br />\nare stuffed with subplots and themes; we've no<br />\nroom for another helping. Redemption, honor,<br />\nrevenge, culture gaps, the trade deficit, and bad<br />\nfeelings about World War II wend their way<br />\nthrough \"Black Rain,\" all of them tickled and<br />\nnone of them touched.<br />\nDouglas' excellent performance is a refreshing<br />\nbreak from his work as Gordon Gekko, the<br />\noverbearing tycoon he portrayed in \"Wall Street.\"<br />\nHis Conklin is not a flashy character, but Douglas<br />\npeppers him with interesting bits of emotion. Andy<br />\nGarcia, however, turns in the film's best performance: he really acts here\u2014a luxury his earlier<br />\nrole in \"The Untouchables\" didn't allow. As Vin-<br /><br />\nJOHNNY HANDSOME<br /><br />\ncent, he is funny, attractive, and endearing.<br />\nMuch was expected of Kate Capshaw in \"Black<br />\nRain,\" but she's a major disappointment; her part<br />\nis badly underwritten.

Mini<br />\nThe laboratory is dark except<br />\nfor the flickers on the screen in<br />\nfront of you. With your hands<br />\npoised on the computer keyboard,<br />\nyou watch as patterns of colored<br />\nsquares flash on and off the<br />\nscreen. The squares vary in<br />\nnumber, layout, and proximity to<br />\neach other, but you are concerned only with their color. You<br />\npress one key when all squares<br />\nare green, and another if one<br />\nsquare is pink. The session lasts<br />\nforty minutes.<br />\nThis experiment is currently<br />\nbeing conducted by Dr. Howard<br />\nEgeth of the Johns Hopkins<br />\npsychology department. Egeth, a<br />\nspecialist in human perception<br />\nand attention, is using the test to<br />\nstudy the form of visual perception known as pre-attention.<br />\nPerception is the process by<br />\nwhich we gather information<br />\nfrom the environment and represent it in the mind. Pre-attention<br />\nis a rudimentary form of perception which we use when<br />\ndistinguishing between obviously dissimilar objects, like X's and<br />\nO's, or squares of green and<br />\npink.<br />\n\"The pre-attentive process controls the 'pop-out' phenomenon,\"<br /><br />\nsays Egeth, \"as when a certain<br />\nshape or color pops off the page<br />\nto catch the viewer's eye.\" A different system, the attentive process, is called upon when making subtle discriminations or performing combined tasks, like finding a red 0 amid red X's and<br />\ngreen O's.<br />\nPre-attention, Egeth adds, is<br />\nalso \"the system that keeps us<br />\nfrom bumping into furniture<br />\nwithout even noticing what the<br />\nfurniture is, or that we almost<br />\nbumped into it.\" It functions<br />\nbelow our level of awareness<br />\nwhile we think of other things.<br />\nThe attentive system, in contrast,<br />\nrequires the full concentration of<br />\nthe mind.<br />\nEgeth believes that the<br />\npreliminary results of his coloredsquared experiment refute a<br />\ntheory recently advanced by Bell<br />\nLaboratory psychologist Bela<br />\nJulesz. According to Julesz, the<br />\nperceptive power of pre-attention<br />\nvaries with the proximity and<br />\nsimilarity of the objects to be<br />\ndistinguished. Pre-attention processing is impaired as the objects<br />\nare moved farther or made to appear more similar.<br />\nEgeth's study, however, shows<br />\nno correlation between accuracy<br />\nof perception and proximity of<br /><br />\nthe colored squares.<br />\nEgeth believes that although<br />\nJulesz's theory, known as the<br />\nfeature-gradient theory, may be<br />\nvalid for certain situations, it cannot be applied generally to the<br />\npre-attentive system. Having<br />\ntested dozens of subjects already,<br />\nhe considers the results conclusive. \"In this situation,\" he<br />\navers, \"Julesz's theory fails.\"<br />\nThe results instead support<br />\nanother theory, the feature-map<br />\nmodel, which proposes that people carry in their minds countless<br />\nmaps \"like little sheets in the cortex\": black/white, straight/curved, flat/solid, etc. According to<br />\nthis model, Egeth's test subjects<br />\nactivate mental green and pink<br />\nmaps and compare it to each pattern flashed across the screen. All<br />\nother maps, such as those concerning the proximity, number, and<br />\norientation of squares, would remain dormant.<br />\nThis model also explains why<br />\ncombined, or conjoint, tasks require the attentive system: when<br />\nsearching for a red 0,for example, in a field of both red X's and<br />\nblack O's, the mind must switch<br />\nrepeatedly between the red/black<br />\nmap and the X/O map, mentally<br />\nholding each map up beside each<br />\nletter in a process too<br /><br />\nSAVE needs you<br />\nto test vaccine<br />\nby Sharyn Horowitz<br />\nThis week, the News-Letter is<br />\nrunning a strange ad: \"If you<br />\nhave never had a smallpox vaccination,\" it says,\"we need you<br />\nto help fight AIDS!\" The Center<br />\nfor Immunization Research, at<br />\nthe Johns Hopkins Hospital, has<br />\nturned to college campuses to find<br />\nhealthy, HIV-negative individuals<br />\nwilling to help test a vaccine for<br />\nAIDS.<br />\nAIDS, like all infections,<br />\nbegins with some infectious agent<br />\ngetting into the body. Once inside, they produce toxic<br />\nsubstances which poison the<br />\nbody, as is the case with<br />\npneumonia. Or, they take control<br />\nof cells, use them to reproduce at<br />\nincredible rates, and then blow<br />\nthem up. This second tactic is used by viruses. The sooner the infectious agent is destroyed, the<br />\nless damage it does.<br />\nThe body's defense is the immune system, a sophisticated and<br />\ncomplex battery of cells and proteins designed to recognize and<br />\ndestroy foreign agents. The immune system begins to work by<br />\nproducing antibodies, proteins<br />\nwhich recognize something about<br />\nthe infectious agent, and stick to<br />\nit. Other parts of the immune<br />\nsystem recognize the antibody<br />\nand destroy it and whatever is attached to it. But the production<br />\nof antibodies is just slow enough<br />\nto allow some damage to be done.<br />\nThe principle behind vaccines,<br />\nsuch as those to prevent diptheria,<br />\ntetanus, chicken pox, and the flu,<br />\nis simply to be prepared. The<br />\nvaccine for each of these infections is a section of the diseasecausing organism's DNA or<br />\nRNA. The part is carefully<br />\nselected to include only harmless'<br /><br />\ngenes, genes that produce innocuous proteins for the agent's<br />\ncoat.<br />\nAfter the vaccine is administered, the vaccine's genes<br />\nensconce themselves in the recipient's own genes. They produce<br />\ntheir protein, and the protein<br />\nbegins to circulate in the<br />\nbloodstream. Antibodies form,<br />\nstick to the protein, and engineer<br />\nits destruction. Once the immune<br />\nsystem has been primed'to produce a certain antibody, it can<br />\nproduce it much more quickly<br />\nwhen the need arises again.<br />\nVaccines are extremely<br />\neffective\u2014they have changed<br />\ndiseases like polio and smallpox<br />\nfrom widespread epidemics into<br />\npractically extinct diseases. The<br />\nneed for an effective vaccine for<br />\nAIDS is tremendous as HIV is<br />\ndevious. After initial infection,<br />\nHIV is active for only a few<br />\nweeks, causing what appears to<br />\nbe a slight case of the flu. Then,<br />\nit hides itself within immune<br />\nsystem cells, before enough antibodies to destroy it can be produced. HIV lies dormant for<br />\nmonths or years, then comes out<br />\nin force to destroy the victim's<br />\nimmune system.<br />\nIf there were HIV antibodies<br />\nalready prepared, when HIV<br />\nentered the body it would be<br />\ndestroyed. The Center for Immunization Research (CIR) has<br />\nbeen selected to participate in a<br />\nsix-center, National Institute of<br />\nHealth study of a promising vaccine, HIVAC-le. CIR has started<br />\na group to focus on the search for<br />\nan AIDS vaccine, Project SAVE<br />\n(Support the AIDS vaccine Effort). Five people have already<br />\nbeen<br />\ninnoculated<br />\nwith<br />\nHIVAC- le, and one year later,<br />\nthey are all doing well.<br /><br />\nSAVE is currently looking for<br />\nvolunteers to help determine what<br />\nis the safest and most effective<br />\ndose of HIVAC- le. The concern<br />\nfor safety is not about subjects<br />\ngetting AIDS\u2014that cannot happen since there is no HIV in the<br />\nvaccine, only a single, harmless<br />\ngene copied from it. They are<br />\nmerely finding out how much<br />\nvaccine will cause production of<br />\nantibodies, and how much will<br />\ncause adverse reactions. The<br />\nadverse reaction can be the same<br />\nas those with other vaccines:<br />\nsoreness at the point of injection,<br />\nfever, chills, rash, and fatigue.<br />\nEach potential volunteer will<br />\nhave three visits before the injection is given. During these visits,<br />\nCIR staff will draw blood and<br />\ntake urine and skin samples to<br />\nscreen for HIV infection and<br />\nother abnormalities, and will inform subjects of the results of the<br />\nHIV test. They will ask questions<br />\nabout drug use and sexual<br />\nbehavior to determine your risk<br />\nof contracting HIV, since they are<br />\nlooking for low-risk individuals.<br />\nThe injection itself will be of<br />\neither HIVAC- le or plain<br />\nsmallpox vaccine. The volunteers<br />\nwill be followed up for at least<br />\none year, with approximately ten<br />\noffice visits. For each visit, from<br />\nscreening to final follow-up, the<br />\nvolunteers will receive some<br />\ncompensation.<br />\nThe point of vaccines is to<br />\nmake antibodies, so recipients<br />\nwill register HIV-antibody<br />\npositive when tested. To prevent<br />\nmisunderstandings, all study participants will be given an identification card certifying them as<br />\na member of a National Institutes<br />\nof Health study and not a carrier<br />\nof HIV.<br /><br />\nAquarium jobs<br />\nThe National Aquarium in<br />\nBaltimore is currently recruiting<br />\ninterns for the January and spring<br />\n1990 semesters in the following<br />\nareas: audio-visual technology,<br />\naquarist, aviculture, graphic<br />\ndesign, herpetology, horticulture,<br />\nmarine education, membership,<br />\npublications, public relations, and<br /><br />\nveterinary technology.<br />\nStudents who are registered for<br />\ncredit at two- and four-year colleges may participate in the<br />\nvolunteer internship.

Two<br />\ntheories of attention transfer are<br />\nnow popular: one views attention<br />\nas a spotlight which, upon leaving one point of fixation, needs<br />\n\"commuting time\" to sweep<br />\nthrough space to its new focus.<br />\nThe other holds that attention<br />\nflashes instantaneously from one<br />\nfocus to the next, with no time<br />\nlost.<br />\nIn Egeth's experiment, subjects<br />\nare asked to make snap observations about shapes pictured at certain distances from each other.<br />\nHis findings indicate that the<br />\ndistance of separation does not affect the speed of perception, supporting the view that attention<br />\njumps across distance without<br />\npassage of time. \"You could call<br />\nit the 'Quantum Leap Theory' of<br />\nattention transfer,' says Egeth.<br />\nEgeth believes that the findings<br />\nof his studies may provide insights into the physiological<br />\nmechanisms of perception.<br />\n\"Psychology often drives neuroscience forward,\" he states.<br />\nHe is himself committed to exploring the psychological aspects<br />\nof the field, in which he has been<br />\ninvolved for the past 25 years. He<br />\ndesigns experiments to divulge<br />\nthe integrated processes of the<br />\nmind, not the mechanical properties of the brain. \"People will be<br />\nhappy when we establish<br />\nneurological correlates for our<br />\nfindings,\"he says, \"but, for now,<br />\nthat's not what we're looking<br />\nfor.\"<br /><br />\n\\'11<br /><br />\nDonna Wiliamson .<br /><br />\nDr. Howard Egeth, professor in the Psychology department.<br /><br />\nThe Sqitid<br />\nRainbows form in misty weather because each droplet of water<br />\nin the air acts as a prism, splitting up sunlight into its component<br />\ncolors.<br /><br />\nBut why are rainbows<br />\ncurved?<br /><br />\n2<br /><br />\nWe can only see light refracted by raindrops if the angle between<br />\nsunlight entering the drop and the light leaving the drop is about<br />\nforty-two degrees.

Many of us will discover<br />\nin years to come that, sadly, the<br />\ndamage was more serious than<br />\nwe had guessed. Poor early nutrition has been linked to heart<br />\ndisease, several forms of cancer,<br />\nliver disease, and bone<br />\nweaknesses. A sound nutritional<br />\nprogram will not only help to prevent these future problems, but<br />\ncan also make you feel better,<br />\nnow.<br />\nThe good news is that improvements in diet have been<br />\nshown to enhance everything<br /><br />\nfrom sleeping patterns and study<br />\nhabits to emotions and sex drive.<br />\nGood nutrition is a worthwhile<br />\ngoal for those concerned about<br />\npresent and future health. Of<br />\ncourse, people of any age can eat<br />\nwell and improve their health, but<br />\nan early beginning yields the best<br />\nresults.<br />\nTo start a nutrition program,<br />\nlike any fitness regimen, requires<br />\na real change in your frame of<br />\nmind. While shedding excess<br />\nbody fat and toning muscle are<br />\nworthy goals in many cases, the<br />\napproach of the \"crash\" diet<br />\nrarely succeeds. It may take off<br />\nthose few pounds now, but if<br />\nyour frame of mind is not changed, the excess fat will find its way<br />\nback. Irving Dardik and Denis<br />\nWaitley, authors of Quantum<br />\nFitness, write: 'If we want<br /><br />\npositive results, we must pay the<br />\nprice, and the price for good<br />\nnutrition is a persevering mindset that is practiced every day,<br />\njust like brushing your teeth.
