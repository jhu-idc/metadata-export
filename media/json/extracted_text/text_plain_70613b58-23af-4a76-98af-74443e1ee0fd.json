After<br />\nreferring to San Francisco as the<br />\n\"Sodom and Gomorrah\" of the<br />\nnation, Dean Wycoff,spokesman<br />\nfor the Santa Clara Moral<br />\nMajority went on to say that San<br />\nFrancisco was also \"the armpit<br />\nof this perverted movement.\"<br />\nA little research brings<br />\nsome interesting facts to light.<br />\nIn the book of Genesis (18,<br />\n22-23), Abraham discusses the<br />\nimpending destruction of Sodom<br />\nand Gomorrah with God. God<br />\ntells Abraham, \"If I find' at<br />\nSodom fifty righteous in the<br />\ncity, I will spare the whole place<br />\nfor their sake.\" (18,26). There<br />\nfollows a classic example of<br />\nmiddle eastern market style<br />\nhaggling, at the end of which<br />\n<br />\nDear Dad:<br />\nI need another $400.

Since no one was to<br />\nlook upon the sight, our only<br />\naccount of the destruction is<br />\nsupplied by Abraham. The day<br />\nafter the destruction he looked<br />\nover the valley and saw that \"the<br />\nsmoke of the land went up like<br />\nthe smoke of a furnace.\"<br />\n(19,28).<br />\nThough the exact method<br />\nof destruction is unclear, it<br />\nseems that an earthquake is<br />\nthe most likely possibility.<br />\nThe same edition of the<br />\nTimes carried a story on the<br />\nimpending major earthquake<br />\nthat is expected to level California, if not drop it into the sea.<br />\nSo it would appear that God is<br />\ndissatisfied with California.<br />\nBut because biblical precedent is the mainstay of the<br />\nmoral movement, we can rest<br />\ncont. on p. 5<br />\n<br />\nyou were when I got rejected at Princeton,<br />\nbut everybody here is like that, so it's not<br />\nso bad.

After working 10 years<br />\nfor the University at a salary<br />\nlevel reaching $10,800, Marge<br />\nMareck requested a $500 raise.<br />\nWhen the raise was denied she<br />\nmade a complaint with Personnel, after which she was threatened with termination by Dr. L.<br />\nGalambos, director of the project. After 8 months of growing<br />\nharassment, she was fired. Ms.<br />\nMareck's qualifications and performance were never questioned<br />\nfor 10 years, until she asked for<br />\na raise.

Laura Rosenthal which appeared in last week's N-L, I<br />\nwould like to make the following statements.<br />\nThe \"D.U.'s Back\" poster<br />\nwhich you found \"sexist and<br />\noffensive \" displayed the rear<br />\nview of a woman whose buttocks were properly draped.<br />\nWhile I will not say that the<br />\nposter artistically expressed the<br />\nbeauty of the female back, it<br />\ncertainly was not graphically<br />\noffensive. The \"use of a naked<br />\n(sic) woman to advertise an<br />\nevent\" of which a naked woman<br />\n(stripper) is the central attraction seems proper, so I assume<br />\nyou feel that said stripper was<br />\n<br />\nexploited. Consider the facts:<br />\nA woman is paid to visually<br />\nstimulate a number of Hopkins<br />\nmen, a stimulation which we<br />\nmust agree served only to<br />\nmagnify their frustrations. I<br />\ncontest that the posters did not<br />\nexploit women, but aided a<br />\nwoman in her exploitation of<br />\nmen.<br />\nThe \"Banana Chasing the<br />\nDonut\" was indeed sexist because it suggested that women<br />\ncategorically are disinterested<br />\nin\u2014nay, fear \"social intercourse.\" I am worried by your<br />\ncomparison of this Victorian<br />\nconcept that women should fear<br />\nsex to the fear a man would have<br />\nof the very real danger posed by<br />\na \"knife-wielding donut.\" The<br />\nbelief that women should not<br />\nenjoy sex was instilled by men in<br />\norder to better control their<br />\nwives. In this era of ERA, the<br />\nsexual act is mutually enjoyable.<br />\nCastration destroys not only a<br />\nman's enjoyment, but also his<br />\nability to give pleasure to<br />\nwomen. Your comparison of<br />\nthe two would seem to indicate<br />\nthat you either espouse the<br />\nVictorian belief that women<br />\nshould fear sex (and remain<br />\nvirginal for their husbands), or<br />\nfear sex because of your own<br />\ninability to give and/or receive<br />\npleasure.<br />\nIn the future, please get<br />\nyour facts straight before using<br />\nsuch shocking words as \"naked\",<br />\ntake the time to contemplate<br />\nyour conclusions of who is being<br />\nexploited before you cry rape,<br />\nand finally, get some counselling<br />\nabout the archaic sexual hangups<br />\nwhich may be contributing to<br />\nyour frigidity.<br />\nA member of<br />\nthe Hopkins community<br />\n<br />\nConfusing Orifices<br />\nTo the Editor:<br />\nI must say that my heart has<br />\ngrown fonder of our fraternal<br />\norganizations in the absence of<br />\nthe exploitative posters to which<br />\nwe were subjected last year: hut,<br />\nthere's still a bit of non-sexist<br />\nground left to be traversed.<br />\nA banana chasing a doughnut?

This is false (he may have<br />\nmisread \"Political Science\").<br />\nIndeed, several of the faculty<br />\nof Political Economy (including<br />\nme) are on record in the General<br />\nAssembly as in disagreement<br />\nwith substantial sections of the<br />\ncommittee's report.<br />\nSince Mr. Einolf does not<br />\ndefine what he means by<br />\n\"courses for the non-major\"<br />\nit is difficult to know what to<br />\nmake of his allegation that<br />\nseveral (most?) departments do<br />\nnot offer such courses. In our<br />\ndepartment a course is considered to be explicitly for majors if<br />\nit has the two intermediate<br />\ncourses in theory (18.301-2)<br />\nas prerequisite.

Now how can you<br />\nexpect a professor, of the<br />\nF.C.R.C., to listen to student<br />\ncomplaints if the students won't<br />\ntake the time to use their<br />\nquestionnaires in order to voice<br />\nthese oomlaints in print?

We cannot<br />\ngo back to the days of rusty<br />\ncoathangers and back-alley abortions!!!<br />\nI think that it will be news<br />\nto most students that Senator<br />\nHelms and Representatives Ashbrook, Hyde, Dornan and others<br />\nhave recently proposed various<br />\nforms of the Human Life<br />\nAmendment (HLA), a Constitutional Amendment which would<br />\nmake the ending of any pregnancy for any reason illegal.<br />\nEven if the life of the mother<br />\nwas in danger, an abortion<br />\nwould not be allowed.<br />\nAll forms of the HLA<br />\ndeclare that fertilized eggs and<br />\nfetuses are \"persons\" entitled to<br />\nthe same rights and responsibilities as an adult human being<br />\neven though these \"persons\" can<br />\nonly be seen under a microscope. This, of course, would<br />\nmake several very popular forms<br />\nof birth control against the law.<br />\nbirthBecause low-estrogen<br />\ncontrol pills and the Intrauterine<br />\nDevice (IUD) prevent the implantation of the fertilized eggs,<br />\nthey would be deemed \"abortifacients\" which deny the fertilized egg its \"right to life.\"<br />\nBy declaring that a fertilized<br />\negg is a \"person,\" the HLA<br />\nwould also bring fertilized eggs<br />\nand fetuses under laws defining<br />\nmurder, kidnapping and other<br />\ncrimes involving a person as a<br />\nvictim. It is highly likely that<br />\nthis will mean that every miscarriage or spontaneous abortion<br />\nmust be investigated to determine whether it was accidental<br />\nor intentional, thus subjecting<br />\nthe pregnant woman to criminal<br />\nprosecution. It is also likely that<br />\ncrimes against a pregnant woman<br />\nwill be a crime against two<br />\npeople and that women who<br />\nhave abortions and those that<br />\nhelp them obtain them would be<br />\nprosecuted for premeditated<br />\nmurder.<br />\nThe HLA is a massive<br />\nintrusion into people's personal<br />\nand private lives and we must<br />\nnot let it become a part of our<br />\nnation's Constitution!

The Johns<br />\nHopkins University is the adversary of its employees: nothing at<br />\nHopkins will change until secretaries, technicians, clerks, all<br />\nemployees, begin to deal with<br />\nAdministration, and deal with it<br />\nwith that in mind.<br />\nMaureen Martindale<br />\nFormer<br />\nJohns<br />\nHopkins<br />\nUniversity secretary<br />\nFormer member Johns Hopkins<br />\nEmployees' Assoc.<br />\n<br />\nOn To The Streets<br />\nTo the Editor:<br />\nI am writing in response to a<br />\nletter in your Feb. 6, 1980 issue<br />\nthat claims \"that WJHU is very<br />\nquickly being taken over by<br />\noutsiders\" and implies that Hopkins does not have a lot to say<br />\ninto who runs the station.\" The<br />\nauthor of that letter has not<br />\nonly mangled the English language, but has mangled the facts as<br />\nwell. Initially, only the students<br />\nand alumni of The Johns Hopkins University were allowed to<br />\nparticipate in the activities at<br />\nWJHU because WJHU was an<br />\norganization of the SAC. But<br />\nwhen WJHU received its FM<br />\nlicense, a decision was made by<br />\nthe WJHU Managing Board<br />\n(composed entirely of Hopkins<br />\nstudents) in conjunction with<br />\nthe Hopkins administration, to<br />\nmake WJHU a Uiliversity activity<br />\nmanaged and operated by students, rather than a \"student<br />\nactivity.\"<br />\nMembers of the<br />\ncommunity surrounding the Uni-<br />\n<br />\nversity had offered their services<br />\nto WJHU,and had begun helping<br />\nout around the station on an<br />\ninformal basis because they still<br />\ncould not officially become<br />\nmembers. As their contributions<br />\nbecame greater and the WJHU<br />\nstaff and management became<br />\nmore aware of the value of their<br />\nwork, it was decided to consider<br />\nand vote upon the issue of<br />\ncommunity members becoming<br />\nofficial members of the WJHU<br />\nstaff. The matter was discussed<br />\nand voted upon at a General<br />\nStaff meeting, and the majority<br />\nof the staff members in attendance voted in favor of allowing<br />\ncommunity members full voting<br />\nrepresentation. However, the<br />\ndecision did not rest solely with<br />\nthe student staff at the station.<br />\nDr. Muller's approval was required and susbsequently given.<br />\nThat decision was reached<br />\nbecause community members<br />\nhave become a vital part of<br />\nWJHU's operation and have<br />\nshown a sense of dedication and<br />\ninvolvement on a year-round<br />\nbasis that Hopkins students have<br />\nsometimes been hard put to<br />\nmatch. This is understandable<br />\nconsidering the course workload<br />\nthat students must bear, and the<br />\nvacation periods that are needed<br />\nto recover from it. But it creates<br />\na continual problem because<br />\nWJHU does indeed have to abide<br />\nby the .commitments it has<br />\nmade, first to Hopkins President<br />\nSteven Muller acting on the part<br />\nof the Trustees, and more<br />\nrecently to the Federal Governregulation<br />\nment (due<br />\nto<br />\nchanges), to stay on the air 365<br />\ndays a year.<br />\nEvery year at student vacation times, the Program Director<br />\nand music directors have had to<br />\nbeg and plead with student staff<br />\nmembers to try and stay during<br />\nat least part of the vacation to<br />\nkeep the station on the air the<br />\nrequired eighteen hours a day.<br />\nAnd each year, it has been a<br />\nskeleton staff of 20 or less<br />\nmembers that have managed to<br />\ncome in and help out, at least 60<br />\npercent of whom were community members (by actual count).<br />\n<br />\nAnd the backbone of that<br />\nskeleton staff has been 75 to<br />\n100 percent community members, also by actual count. After<br />\nall, would you be willing to give<br />\nup a trip home to New York, or<br />\nBoston or California, etc.just to<br />\nput your show on the air? And<br />\nthat brings up another important<br />\npoint. According to the admissions office, more than 75% of<br />\nthe undergraduate students at<br />\nHopkins are out-of-state students. Add to that number,<br />\nthose students from outside of<br />\nBaltimore, and you have relatively few students familiar with the<br />\nhistory, politics, or \"beat\" of<br />\nthis city. Yet it is the people of<br />\nthe City of Baltimore that<br />\nWJHU is obligated to serve. The<br />\nanonymous letter writer (ALW)<br />\nstates that \"the purpose of the<br />\nstation is to give students an<br />\nopportunity for having fun while<br />\nlearning some journalism skills.<br />\nI submit that the first purpose of<br />\nany licensed radio station is to<br />\nproduce quality programming<br />\nfor the entire community (for<br />\nwhich the students at Johns<br />\nHopkins are a measurable part),<br />\nand that other considerations_Are<br />\nsecondary, although they may<br />\nstill be of great importance. The<br />\ntwo people that ALW mentions<br />\nas seemingly dangerous are two<br />\nof the people that have been<br />\naround during vacations when<br />\nALW was probably basking in<br />\nthe sun somewhere. And since<br />\none must still be a Hopkins<br />\nstudent or alum to be a Managing Board member (until the<br />\nadministration decides otherwise), it should be noted that<br />\nthe Program Director is a student here.<br />\nAnd to top off the stupidity of<br />\nthe statements in ALW's ignominious letter, the News Director<br />\nwho is slanderously refered to as<br />\n\"a product of the Baltimore<br />\nHitler movement\" is as Jewish<br />\nas a bagel from a New York deli.<br />\nIn conclusion, I would also<br />\nlike to direct a comment to the<br />\nTrustees in regard to backing<br />\nthe proposed 13,720 watt station. (You blew it again, ALW.<br />\nIt's not 15,000 watts.) The<br />\n<br />\nFCC has recently taken action<br />\nagainst one or more college<br />\nstations to fight against just<br />\nwhat ALW states should be the<br />\npurpose of WJHU's existance.<br />\nThe students operating the stations were not trying to serve<br />\nthe greater community. They<br />\nwere operating the stations \"for<br />\nfun\". Maybe that's why the<br />\nCorporation for Public Broadcasting has taken to refering to<br />\nsome college stations as \"electronic sandboxes\". I hope no<br />\none allows that to happen here.<br />\nOh, and a hearty thanks to the<br />\ncommunity members at WJHU<br />\nfor a job well done!<br />\nJud French<br />\nFormer General Manager,<br />\nWJHU-FM<br />\n<br />\nthe fun of the other dogs.<br />\nThese innocent and ornamental creatures do no harm<br />\nwhile it is true that they are<br />\nsomewhat casual about their<br />\nnecessary bodily functions, still,<br />\nI must declare that their necessary leavings are less offensive<br />\nthan beer cans, discarded lunch<br />\nbags, and other rubbish carelessly dropped by their human<br />\nsuperiors.

Completion of the Institute is at least two<br />\nyears away (in fact, construction won't start until this<br />\nsummer). But Institute staff will begin their infiltration<br />\nthis March. An initial staff of five is expected in early<br />\nMarch. They will be temporarily housed in Rowland<br />\nHall until the Institute building is completed in 1983 or<br />\n1984. By May or June, 15 to 20 Institute staff members<br />\nwill be cramming the halls of Rowland. After that, the<br />\nstaff won't increase much until the Institute building is<br />\ncompleted.<br />\nThe Space Telescope is already under construction. It will be placed in orbit about 375 miles above<br />\nthe earth by the Space Shuttle in late 1984 or early<br />\n1985. The telescope will have a useful life of about 15<br />\nyears. Adjunct Professor William Fastie of the Physics<br />\ndepartment seemed to flinch slightly at the suggestion<br />\nthat the Space Telescope, like Skylab, might drop out of<br />\norbit and be destroyed. This is no longer a problem, he<br />\nasserts, because calculations of the earth's gravitational<br />\npull are now more accurate. In addition, with the Space<br />\nShuttle in operation, when and if the Space Telescope<br />\nwere pulled too close to the earth, the shuttle could<br />\nsimply go put it back where it belongs. (Fastie also<br />\npointed out that if the government had adequately<br />\nfunded the Space Shuttle project it would have probably<br />\nbeen operational in time to save the Skylab.) In addition to being able to adjust the Space Telescope's orbit,<br />\nthe Space Shuttle will enable NASA to repair the telescope in space, as well as replace obsolete equipment<br />\nwith more sophisticated equipment when and if desired.<br />\nThe Institute will be constructed on the Homewood west campus, west of San Martin drive. The site is<br />\nnorth of the Athletic Center. Thouse definite plans have<br />\nnot been made, the building will cover approximately<br />\n70,000 square feet, including parking. The present<br />\ndesign also had provisions for two 20,000-square-foot<br />\nextensions if the Institute needs to expand. The building will house a full time staff of about 140, 25 to 40 of<br />\nwhom will be professional astronomers. In addition to<br />\nthe full time staff, an estimated 200 astronomers are<br />\nexpected to visit and use the facilities annually.<br />\nThere will be no antennae at the Institute. All<br />\ncommunications between the Institute and the Space<br />\nTelescope will be handled through Goddard Space Flight<br />\nCenter in Greenbelt, Md. The information from the<br />\ntelescope will be relayed by one of two satellites to<br />\nGoddard, and then by cable from Goddard to the<br />\nInstitute.

Though no<br />\ndefinite plans have been made, it is expected that some<br />\nsenior Institute staff may have joint appointments with<br />\nthe University. There are no plans for a Hopkins Department of Astronomy, but no one doubts that that element of the Physics department will grow.<br />\nThe working mechanics of the Institute were<br />\naptly described by William Fastie. According to Fastie,<br />\nthe Institute will be somewhat analogous to JHU as a<br />\nwhole. An advisory board of astronomers will judge<br />\nprojects for the telescope's use and decide what projects<br />\nto undertake and when. This is similar to the Academic<br />\nCouncil's purpose of choosing faculty, and to some<br />\ndegree directing the types of things to be studied.<br />\nHopkins will have no special privileges for use of the<br />\ntelescope; Hopkins scientists will have to submit proposals like everyone else.<br />\nThe Institute will be managed by AURA and the<br />\nfull time staff will be AURA personnel.

Funds for the other AURA observatories are<br />\nsupplied by the National Science Foundation.<br />\nWhen NASA requested proposals for operating<br />\nthe Institute, various consortia began looking around for<br />\npotential sites. Though one would like to believe that<br />\nHopkins actively sought out one of these consortia from<br />\nthe beginning, or vice versa, the actual impetus for<br />\nHopkins' involvement was somewhat different. Arthur<br />\nDavidsen of the Physics department explained that<br />\nduring a social dinner with the Director of AURA, the<br />\ndirector suggested that Hopkins might want to submit a<br />\nproposal. Davidsen then proceeded to test the Hopkins<br />\nenvironment to see if there really was an interest. Thus<br />\nbegan one of JHU's more fruitful endeavors.<br />\nWhy AURA chose Hopkins over five or six other<br />\ninstitutions is not certain. Davidsen suggests that a<br />\nnumber of things helped. The Baltimore locaiton<br />\npresented many advantages; close proximity to Goddard<br />\nSpace Flight may have been important. The annual cost<br />\nof cable rental between Homewood and Goddard is<br />\nabout $24,000, while a proposed site in San Diego<br />\nwould have raised the cost of cable rental to nearly $1<br />\nmillion annually. The proximity of a major airport was<br />\nundoubtedly helpful, as was the relatively low cost of<br />\nhousing in Baltimore. The cultural diversity of a city was<br />\nanother possible advantage.

The major advantage of<br />\nplacing a telescope in orbit is that it will not have a<br />\nblanket of atmosphere fuzzing its view of the sky. The<br />\nearth's atmosphere blots out extremely faint objects and<br />\nblurs those which we can observe, so most distant<br />\nobjects appear as almost featureless patches of light.<br />\nEven though the space telescope is smaller than the<br />\nlargest ground-based telescope, it will be the most<br />\noptically precise instrument ever created, with a resolution (ability to show fine detail) 105 times greater than<br />\nany ground instrument. Its accuracy in pinpointing a<br />\nsection of sky will go down to one 4000th of a second<br />\nof arc. (There are 180 degrees of arc from horizon to<br />\nhorizon, 60 minutes per degree, and 60 seconds per<br />\nminute.) Therefore, the space telescope will be accurate to 1/2592000000 of the sky, a precision far surpassing any device on earth. Mounted within the casing will<br />\nbe the optical portions of the telescope and a spectrograph, whose components are being tested here at<br />\nHopkins.<br />\nAs a tool for astronomy and astrophysics, the<br />\nspace telescope will be incomparable. One of the great<br />\nmysteries of astrophysic is the nature and origin of quasars.<br />\nQuasars (short for quasi-stellar objects) were first discovered with radio telescopes and have remained an<br />\nenigma to science ever since. Quasars are distant objects<br />\nwhich put out enormous amounts of energy--too much,<br />\nit seems, to have been produced by a normal galaxy.<br />\nBecause quasars are extremely distant objects, our only<br />\noptical pictures of them are fuzzy at best. Several<br />\nconjectures have been made on what the quasars are, but<br />\nall of these guesses really depend upon getting a clearer<br />\nlook at a quasar. Are quasars galaxies with enormous<br />\nblack holes in their nuclei? Do they represent an early<br />\nstage in galactic evolution? (Since light travels at a<br />\nfinite constant velocity and the quasars are uniformly<br />\ndistant, astronomers infer that quasars are relatively old<br />\nobjects.) Some fuzzy patches have been observed<br />\n<br />\naround quasars, thus leading to-the conjecture that they<br />\ncould be galaxies, but the fuzzy regions could also be gas<br />\nbetween us and the quasar. If it is indeed gas, then there<br />\nis more intergalactic matter than expected; if they are<br />\ngalaxies, then why haven't we observed any closer<br />\nquasars? The fuzzy regions around the quasars are<br />\nmoving away from us at a slower speed than the quasars<br />\nthemselves, which could imply that the fuzzy patches<br />\nare enormous amounts of gas being expelled from the<br />\nquasar. (Even though both the quasar and the gas are<br />\nmoving away from us, the slower-receding gas indicates<br />\nthat it is moving away relative to the quasar.) Everything concerning the quasars literally remains to be seen.<br />\nAnother subject of scrutiny for the space telescope which may in turn aid our understanding of<br />\nquasars are the Seyfert galaxies. Both the optical spectra<br />\nof the Seyfert galaxies and the optical/ultraviolet spectra<br />\nof the quasars indicate large, turbulent cauldrons of gas<br />\nheated by powerful ultraviolet sources, an indicator of a<br />\npossible black hole at the Seyfert's nucleus. Indeed,<br />\nSeyfert galaxies may be mini-quasars, but a clearer<br />\npicture of a Seyfert galaxy may dispell this theory.<br />\nSome galaxies are powerful radio sources, and it may be<br />\ndiscovered that they are the real astrophysical relatives<br />\nof the quasars.<br />\nBlack holes are a subject of constant interest for<br />\nastrophysicists, and naturally the space telescope will be<br />\ntrained on possible black holes in our neighborhood of<br />\nthe galaxy. Several nearby stars (such as the famous<br />\nCygnus X-1) are binary stars with invisible, massive<br />\ncompanions which are strong X-ray sources. Unseen<br />\ncompanion stars such\" as these are believed to be black<br />\nholes, and although by their very nature it is impossible<br />\nto get a picture of a black hole, a picture of a black hole<br />\nbinary system may show us a black hole's effects on the<br />\narea around itself and its visible companion, thus verifying the existence of black holes.<br />\nJust as we have been inferring the existence of<br />\n<br />\nblack holes without an actual \"picture\" of one, so have<br />\nwe inferred the existence of planets circling some nearby<br />\nstars. Stars which are suspected of having planetary<br />\nsystems (such as Barnard's Star) exhibit a characteristically uneven wobble, but because of the optical limitations of ground-based telescopes, it has been impossible<br />\nto see any planets. A planet is a dim object compared to<br />\nits sun, so it is blotted out by the brightness of its star.<br />\nBecause of the high resolution of the space telescope,<br />\nthough, it should be able to see a Jupiter-sized or larger<br />\nplanet if there is one there to see.<br />\nModern cosmology, the study of the universe as a<br />\nwhole, stands to be refined by the space telescope. In<br />\nthe 1920's, Edwin Hubble discovered a clear correlation<br />\nbetween the distance of a galaxy from us and how fast it<br />\nis receding from us. (The major basis for the belief that<br />\nthe universe is expanding is that all galaxies are moving<br />\naway from us.) There is a large range of error attached<br />\nto the Hubble constant (relation) which is caused by the<br />\nmargin of error in our measurements of distance to<br />\nnearby galaxies. The space telescope will be able to pick<br />\nout important reference stars within neighborhood<br />\ngalaxies and use them to get a more accurate measure<br />\nof distance to the galaxy. A by-product of the refinement of the Hubble constant will be better estimation of<br />\nthe age of the universe, whose equation includes the<br />\nHubble constant. The current estimate is 15 to 20<br />\nbillion years, but a more exact Hubble constant will<br />\nplace our finger closer to the exact figure.<br />\nThese are merely the highlights of the research to<br />\nbe done with the space telescope. Astronomers will be<br />\ntraining it on every interesting object in the heavens in a<br />\nmad dash to make the best use of their new toy. Without a doubt, the space telescope, which will be focus<br />\nof astrophysical research over the next two decades, is<br />\none of the most important tools to fall into the hands of<br />\npure science in recent times.<br />\n<br />\n\fPAGE 12 / FEBRUARY 20, 1981<br />\n<br />\nPLACEMENT<br />\nBUREAU<br />\nDATE<br />\n<br />\nFeb.20 7:00& 11:00PM<br />\nFeb.21 9:00 P.M.<br />\n*** The Senior Class Film Series presents ***<br />\n<br />\n2/24/81<br />\n2/24/81<br />\n2/25/81<br />\n2/25/81<br />\n2/26/81<br />\n2/26/81<br />\n2/26/81<br />\n2/27/81<br />\n2/27/81<br />\n3/2/81<br />\n3/2/81<br />\n3/2/81<br />\n3/3/81<br />\n3/3/81<br />\n3/4/81<br />\n3/4/81<br />\n3/5/81<br />\n3/5/81<br />\n3/6/81<br />\n3/6/81<br />\n<br />\nORGANIZATION<br />\nGould Inc., Chesapeake Division<br />\nMaryland National Bank<br />\nBechtel Power Corporation<br />\nBethlehem Steel<br />\nWatkins Johnson Company<br />\nNUS Corporation<br />\nGulf Oil Company<br />\nTymnet Inc.<br />\nWard Machinery<br />\nSocial Security Administration<br />\nAddison-Wesley Publishing Company<br />\nBooz, Allen & Hamilton<br />\nEDS Nuclear<br />\nScientific Atlanta<br />\nApplied Physics Laboratory<br />\nWestern Electric Company<br />\nGTE Sylvania<br />\nBendix Environmental Processing Group<br />\nUS Army Materials Development &<br />\nReadiness Command<br />\nArmy Corps of Engineers<br />\n<br />\nMerryman Hall<br />\nThe Office of l<br />\no<br />\ni<br />\nr the Chaplain<br />\n\u2022<br />\niYitt4Ce(Dil iY()v1.1t<br />\n, ))Th<br />\n<br />\n4trie<br />\nWo3rds Friday Feb 20, 720 & 1130<br />\nSalutiay Feb 21, 920<br />\nFantast Planet: Friday Feb. 20, WO<br />\nSEdirday Feb. 21, 700 & 1120<br />\n<br />\nSkiver Halt<br />\nJohns Hopkins<br />\n!University<br />\n<br />\nStudents & Sr. Citizens $1.50 w/I.D.<br />\nGeneral Admission $2.00<br />\n<br />\nDouble feature:<br />\n$2.50 students/ $3.00 general<br />\n<br />\n\fNEWS-LETTER / PAGE 13<br />\n<br />\nUnderstanding Shylock<br />\n<br />\nPBS Airs Shakespeare's Most Tragic Comedy<br />\nBY RICHARD SEAMON<br />\nThe Maryland Center for Public<br />\nBroadcasting will present The Merchant<br />\nof Venice Monday, February 23 from 8<br />\nto 11 p.m. One of Shakespeare's most<br />\npsychologically and dramatically complex<br />\nworks, this is the second production in<br />\nSeason Three of the on-going series,\"The<br />\nShakespeare Plays.\" The TV version shows<br />\nthat the play has lost none of its power to<br />\nquestion the values of a Christian<br />\nsociety, and the producers and directors<br />\nhave transplanted The Merchant from<br />\nstage to screen with beauty and clarity.<br />\nThose who grumble at the Internal Revenue Service may find comfort in<br />\nthe long history of the notion of exacting<br />\na pound of flesh for payment.

The<br />\norchestra blasted the piece with surprising<br />\nverve and finesse. Comissiona's conducting was a little faster than usual, but the<br />\norchestra experienced no significant<br />\nproblems in articulation. The horns,<br />\nusually the ensemble's weakest point,<br />\nwere especially forceful and, mercifully,<br />\non pitch.

Helmerson's playing<br />\nwas one of the evening's greatest joys; it<br />\nwas lush and resounding, yet not too<br />\ntechnical.

Since it started twenty years ago as<br />\nthe Maryland Ballet, Maryland's only<br />\nprofessional ballet company has managed<br />\nto continue providing quality dance<br />\nperformances, at an average of four a<br />\nyear.<br />\nIn August of 1979, the administrative offices of the Ballet were swept by<br />\na fire which destroyed records, sets, and<br />\ncostumes. Virtually abandoned by its<br />\nadministrative board, the Ballet suffered a<br />\nsteady decline until January of 1980,<br />\nwhen Charles F. Fischl was appointed<br />\nboth President and General Manager.<br />\nFischl was faced with a $400,000 deficit<br />\nand had only $55,000 in pledges and<br />\ngrants to rely on. Nevertheless, Fischl<br />\ndrove the Ballet forward, presenting the<br />\nworld premiere of Equus\u2014 The Ballet,<br />\nreplacing the entire professional staff of<br />\nthe Ballet, and bringing Alfonso Cata<br />\n<br />\nto Baltimore as the company's artistic<br />\ndirector.<br />\nWith these changes in management, Fischl reduced the deficit to<br />\n$170,000 by September 1980. Buoyed<br />\nby these efforts, the Ballet, now the<br />\nBaltimore Ballet, presented a new version<br />\nof The Nutcracker, choreographed by<br />\nCata, and set in Baltimore of the turn of<br />\nthe century. This production was well<br />\nreceived in Baltimore, as well as in<br />\nHagerstown and Roanoke, Virginia,<br />\nwhere it was taken on tour.<br />\nAlthough the outlook for the<br />\nBallet is starting to improve, it is by no<br />\nmeans rosy. Fischl described some of the<br />\nproblems he faces: \"Currently, I spend<br />\neighty percent of my time trying to cut<br />\ndown our deficit, and the rest on our<br />\nday-to-day affairs. It should be the other<br />\nway around\u2014I should be able to work<br />\nmore closely with Mr. Cata on our<br />\nprograms, and we should have no deficit.\"<br />\nOne of Fischl's prime concerns is<br />\nto build a following for ballet in Balticont. on p. 15<br />\n<br />\n\fPAGE 14 / FEBRUARY 20, 1981<br />\n<br />\nVillage Voice Editor At Homewood<br />\nBY DAVID NEWMAN<br />\nThe journalist, who is very chic,<br />\nbreakfasts on a sort of banana and sour<br />\ncream mix from his Cuisinart, daydreams<br />\nlazily about the play he will one day<br />\nwrite (Plato leaves a benign romance with<br />\nDavid Bowie to take up immoderately<br />\nwith Susan Sontag), ponders as he drives<br />\nhis Alfa with artistic abandon about what<br />\nwill replace ska as the Next Big Thing,<br />\nand, arriving at the offices of the Scarsdale Social Climber, sits down at his video<br />\nterminal and in a style that is both glib<br />\nand impervious begins his comment on<br />\nour times, entitled \"Self-consciousness-An Investigative Report.\"<br />\nDavid Schneiderman doesn't like<br />\nthe directions in which journalism is<br />\nmoving.<br />\nThe editor of New York's Village<br />\nVoice (and a late sixties alumnus of<br />\nHopkins and SAIS) spoke Wednesday at<br />\nHomewood on the \"Decline and Fall of<br />\nHe sees<br />\nEstablishment Journalism.\"<br />\n\"upscale journalism\" as its equally useless<br />\nreplacement.<br />\nSchneiderman's News-Letter experience may have given him a somewhat distorted picture of establishment<br />\njournalism. During his 1965-66 tenure as<br />\nnews editor, the paper published mock<br />\nMan of the Year awards, commending for<br />\ntheir meritorious deeds three mass<br />\nmurderers and Lyndon B. Johnson.<br />\nSomewhat less than pleased, University<br />\npresident Milton S. Eisenhower ordered<br />\nthe N-L's co-editors suspended and<br />\nthreatened Schneiderman with a similar<br />\nfate. Undaunted (in fact, rather pleased),<br />\nthe dedicated journalists protested that<br />\ntheir freedom of the press had been<br />\nabridged. Eisenhower, not known as a<br />\nconstitutional law scholar, snapped, \"it's<br />\nonly a house organ.\"<br />\nSince then, the relationship<br />\nbetween the power and the press has<br />\nbecome even more twisted. Using the<br />\nNew York Times as his model, Schneidman traced the transition from its role as<br />\nservant of the powerful to servant of the<br />\nThe Times that<br />\nupwardly mobile.<br />\nSchneiderman went to work for in 1970(as<br />\na summer news clerk) was still very much<br />\nthe friend of the government-business<br />\ncomplex, championing the old values<br />\nof \"civility, moderation, and civility.\"<br />\nWith the publication of the Pentagon<br />\nPapers in 1971, the Times broke with<br />\n<br />\nthat establishment for the first time.<br />\nRichard Nixon had already been president<br />\nthree years, and he was busy tearing<br />\ndown the inner sanctum he could never<br />\nbecome part of. The Times could no<br />\nlonger cover an establishment that didn't<br />\nexist.<br />\nWhen economic realities caught<br />\nup with the Times\u2014circulation was<br />\ndropping and they hadn't upgraded their<br />\nproduction or marketing techniques\u2014it<br />\nseemed time for a change. \"They looked<br />\nto Clay Felker (of New York magazine)<br />\nwho said 'look to the people who spend<br />\nmoney to be chic.' Felker defined that<br />\nwhole thing\u2014eat at the right places,<br />\nbuy throw pillows and Cuisinarts. The<br />\nadvertisers loved it, the money came<br />\n3ouring in, and the Times was saved.\"<br />\nThe result is that the Times has<br />\n<br />\nbecome a prisoner of its own upscale<br />\nreadership. \"Today, the Times publishes<br />\nmore articles on food than on those who<br />\nare poor; it really ignores the New York's<br />\n40% minority population; it is ignoring<br />\nsocial problems.\"<br />\nThe criticism seems double<br />\nedged\u2014 the old guard wasn't any good<br />\nbecause it was a partner, not a critic, of<br />\nthe power elite, and the new guard hasn't<br />\neven got the partner status, only its<br />\ntrappings.

Rumisonko is a quartet consisting<br />\nof Carlos Arrien, Alfredo Escobar,<br />\nRicardo Diaz, and Renes Iribarren. They<br />\nplay the music of the Quechua and<br />\nAymara Indians, who inhabit the highlands of Bolivia, Chile, Peru and Argen.<br />\ntina, on the charango (a mandolinlike<br />\ninstrument), the quena(a reed flute) the<br />\npan-pipes, the botnbo lu guero (a drum),<br />\nand the guitar.<br />\ntin*SiOn is $3,00.<br />\n<br />\nIt is generally fashionable to shoot<br />\ndown any group that gets too much<br />\nadvance press, i.e. the violent reaction the<br />\nGang of Four suffered from the press<br />\nafter the initial raves. U2's Boy hit<br />\nAmerican shores after the British music<br />\npress went beserk over it, and one can<br />\nalready hear the axes sharpening. Yet<br />\nBoy is a good album, if not a great one,<br />\nand the scary thing is the promise of what<br />\nis not delivered on this disc. Since all<br />\nmembers of the group are under 21,<br />\nmusical history could be rewritten if this<br />\nact gets itself together.<br />\nU2 is made up of vocalist Bono<br />\nVox, guitarist \"the Edge,\" bassist Adam<br />\nClayton, and drummer Larry Mullen.<br />\nThe group's instruments and its use of<br />\nlyrical guitar work would normally cause<br />\none to say they are just another progressive rock aberration.

Enraged that his daughter Jessica<br />\nelopes with a gentile, and a friend of<br />\nAntonio's, Shylock determines to have<br />\nhis pound of flesh and goes to court with<br />\na knife and scale to get it.<br />\nThe court.scene of Act Four, with<br />\nall the main characters in open confrontation, brings out the highest quality of<br />\nacting in this production. Portia's character blossoms when she disguises herself<br />\nas a lawyer; as a man she need not spare<br />\nher sharp wit and depth of feeling. In the<br />\nmost tragic note ever sounded in a<br />\nShakespeare comedy, as Antonio stoically<br />\nlooks away from the knife poised before<br />\nhis chest, Shylock tumbles from his<br />\ngreatest triumph to his nadir. It seems<br />\n<br />\nthat the court will uphold his bloody<br />\nrevenge against the Christian world, but<br />\nhe ends up down on his knees, robbed of<br />\nhis money, his daughter, and his religion.<br />\nAct Five softens some of the<br />\nharshness of Shylock's fate. The three<br />\ncouples that form during the play come<br />\ntogether at Belmont in quiet scenes laced<br />\nwith music, and the power of love is reasserted. Nonetheless, much of the play's<br />\npower depends on this tension between<br />\ntragic and comic elements.<br />\nThe skillful intertwining of characters' fates made for a pleasant three<br />\nhours. Opulent costumes, subtle lighting,<br />\nand intelligent directing made this production delightful to watch, whether or<br />\nnot one is familiar with the play. Thanks<br />\nto Warren Mitchell's performance as<br />\nShylock, the TV version will remain<br />\ndistinct from and comparable to stage<br />\nversions starring the likes of Laurence<br />\nOlivier and George C. Scott. In short,<br />\nthe broadcast itself, as well as Shakespeare's play, is a work of art.<br />\n<br />\nthe case.<br />\nTake the opening cut of the<br />\nalbum I Will Follow . It begins with a<br />\nperverted set of Chuck Berryish guitar<br />\nchords and moves on to a melody carried<br />\nby Vox's awesomely powerful voice,<br />\nwhich betrays not a day of his youth.<br />\nThis isn't New Wave, this isn't new<br />\nanything\u2014 it's damn near pop. Yet, if it is<br />\npop, it's a hard pop with intelligence in<br />\nits instrumentation and no sugar coating<br />\nin the lyrics. And so goes the album.<br />\nThe hardest thing to do is not to<br />\nrave about the Edge. At the age of 19 he<br />\nis a guitarist to contend with, finding a<br />\nstrange style which combines elements of<br />\nMark Knopfler, Joe Walsh, Dave Gilmour,<br />\nand even Mick Ralphs in his Mott the<br />\nHoople days. His name is perfect, for the<br />\nEdge is what he is to U2.<br />\nEven the lyrical content of the<br />\nalbum has its moments. Boy is the title<br />\nfor a good reason: it is an album of youth<br />\ngrowing old, of that awful time between<br />\nboyhood and manhood.<br />\nThe sides<br />\nhave different themes: side one conveys<br />\nagony, fear, and adolescent rebellion<br />\nwhile the flip side's message is hope,<br />\nfantasy, and fame. The urgency felt in<br />\nVox's vocals is especially real and convincing, since it is so close to his own experience.<br />\n\"Twilight\" is clearly the gem of<br />\nthe album, both lyrically and musically.<br />\nIt is a metaphor of growing up, and when<br />\nVox sings, \"My body grows and grows,/<br />\nIt frightens me you know./ The old man<br />\ntried to walk me home./ I thought he<br />\nshould have known,\" you know he means<br />\nit. U2 manages much more depth on this<br />\ncut than their three instruments should<br />\nallow, but the standout is the Edge's<br />\nguitar solo. Sparse and lean, it means as<br />\nmuch to the song as the lyric.<br />\nWhile \"Twilight\" may be the most<br />\naccessible tune of the album, \"Shadows<br />\nand Tall Trees\" is the hardest to understand. The musical roots of this song are<br />\nnumerous--from the Lou Reedish mood<br />\nto the Police-like guitar work, from the<br />\nPeter Gabriel-like paranoia to the Love<br />\nstyle drumming. It doesn't all work,<br />\nhowever, particularly the enigmatic lyrics<br />\nwhich express yearning for fame. Nevertheless, the song does not lack for ambicont. on p. 15<br />\n<br />\n\fNEWS-LETTER / PAGE 15<br />\n<br />\nNew Baltimore Ballet<br />\n<br />\nSuccessful Season Bodes Well For The Future<br />\ncontinued from p. 13<br />\nmore. \"If the adminstration of the Ballet<br />\nhad considered this fifteen years ago,\" he<br />\nsaid, \"they may have cultured a large<br />\nenough audience, and we would have no<br />\nproblems. We are trying th reach out into<br />\nthe community with our programs.

The Ballet has been<br />\nplagued by problems in booking halls and<br />\ninopportune time changes made by the<br />\nowners. The company favors Goucher's<br />\nKraushaar Auditorium, but would prefer<br />\na more central location. In addition,<br />\nplans for a fully orchestrated ballet cannot be realized at Goucher due to the<br />\nabsence of a pit. The Ballet has cast<br />\nlonging eycs at Hopkins' own Shriver<br />\nHall, but has little hope of performing<br />\nthere regularly, since the hall is usually<br />\nbooked by the Office of Special Events<br />\nand the student weekend film series.<br />\nDespite the other problems, artis\u2022 tic director Cata is surrounded by a loyal<br />\ngroup of young performers and reliable<br />\nfriends from the ballet world. Friends of<br />\nFisch! and Cata have helped the Baltimore Ballet to its feet so that even<br />\nworking with a tight budget, the Ballet<br />\nhas developed a much improved program.<br />\n<br />\nThe Winter Repertory Program,<br />\nwhich ended last week, included six<br />\nvaried presentations choreographed by<br />\nCata and a host of talented guests. The<br />\nprogram was led by \"Valse Fantasie,\"<br />\nchoreographed by George Balanchine of<br />\nthe New York City Ballet. This was<br />\nfollowed by Deborah Zall's \"Pastorale,\"<br />\nan abstract dance. \"Pastorale\" was<br />\ndanced barefoot, and as a result lacked<br />\nsome of the classic postures of the<br />\nballet, a lack which was made up for by<br />\nthe movement of dancers Ken Whites,<br />\nDenis Johnston, and Bruce Steivel. While<br />\n\"Pastorale\" was dominated by the men,<br />\nBalanchine's \"Tchaikovsky Pas de Deux\"<br />\nwas heightened by the performance of<br />\nDiane Nelson, who eclipsed partner Jacob<br />\nNielsen in a well-choreographed and lively<br />\nduet.<br />\n<br />\nU2's Hit US Shores<br />\ncontinued from p. 14<br />\ntion<br />\nThe running of \"An Cat Dubh\"<br />\ninto \"Into the Heart\" on side one best<br />\ndescribes what happens to Boy. \"An Cat<br />\nDubh\" is the mood piece of the album-dark, ominous, again pulled from the<br />\nGabriel bag of paranoia. The frantic<br />\ndrumming, screeching guitar, and bitterness in the vocal all somehow add up to a<br />\nrather pretty melody, but then the song<br />\njust runs too long.<br />\n\"Into the Heart\" is in a way the<br />\ncatharsis after \"An Cat Duhb,\" but it still<br />\nis a little flat. Only two minutes long, it<br />\nseems interminable; somehow you've<br />\n<br />\nheard it all before. No matter how<br />\nallusive U2 is to other groups, it is most<br />\nallusive to itself; the material doesn't<br />\nrun thin, it runs familiar.<br />\nWhere U2 will go from here is<br />\nhard to say. Boy is a competent debut<br />\nalbum, yet still seriously flawed, in the<br />\nnature of Greetings from Asbury Park,<br />\nN.J., Jackson Browne, or The Boomtown<br />\nRats. U2 is just one small sapling among<br />\nall the tall trees of the musical forest, yet<br />\nthere is an intangible something about<br />\nthem that makes one wonder what the<br />\nfuture will bring. With the ambition they<br />\ndisplay here, one can hope for and expect<br />\nimprovement with age.<br />\n<br />\nThe program continued with a<br />\ntriplet of \"balleticized\" tangos choreographed by Cata. \"Tangos\" highlighted<br />\nthe talents of Allison Gonzalez, who<br />\ncould pose equally well in the light and<br />\nout of it. The music of \"Tangos\" was<br />\nupbeat, and the dance was well choreographed, save for Cata's dependence on<br />\nsexual sight gags.<br />\nAfter an intermission, the viewer<br />\nwas served the piece de resistance, John<br />\nClifford's Charleston, a roaring revival of<br />\nthe dance that swept the Jazz Age. In<br />\nthis, sexual sight gags were effective in<br />\ncapturing the decadence of flappers,<br />\ngangsters, and<br />\nburlesque<br />\nqueens.<br />\n\"Charleston\" was more an impressionistic<br />\ndance than a ballet, but the performance<br />\nof the Company made this an enjoyable<br />\nendpoint for the program. Once again,<br />\nDenis Johnston was superb, this time in<br />\nhis role as the \"come-on king\". in a<br />\nnumber entitled 'If I Could Be With You<br />\nOne Hour Tonight.\" Other exceptional<br />\nperformances came from Kathleen Smith<br />\nand Bruce Steivel, whose \"Snowy Morning Blues\" so well depicted the return<br />\nhome from a long night at the speakeasy.<br />\nExcellent<br />\ncostumery from<br />\nArdith<br />\nHaddow added much to the performance.<br />\nThe Ballet will continue to<br />\npresent its brand of dance, next in their<br />\nSpring Repertory program, which will<br />\ninclude<br />\nBalanchine's<br />\n\"Concerto<br />\nBarocco\", Cata's \"Sweet Carman,\" and a<br />\nworld<br />\npremiere of a Jean-Pierre<br />\nBonnefous performance.

With<br />\njust one game reamining, the<br />\nJays have a record of 12-11.<br />\nNikic and Tom<br />\nNick<br />\nTessitore provided the scoring<br />\npunch for the Jays as they<br />\navenged an earlier 85-67 loss to<br />\nHaverford. Nikic was on fire<br />\nthroughout the game. He shot<br />\n14 for 20 from the field. Nikic<br />\nfinished with a season-high 31<br />\npoints (14 in the first half and<br />\n17 in the second half). It was<br />\nhis best offensive performance<br />\nof the season and the most<br />\npoints scored in a game by a<br />\nBlue Jay this season.

The margin switched to a pass-and-cut<br />\noffense, freeing a player for an<br />\nopen shot. As a result, the Jays<br />\nhad a potent offensive attack<br />\nand outscored Widener 52-50 in<br />\nthe second half.

The nearly two-week<br />\nbreak between the Glassboro<br />\nmeet and the MAC Championship belies the intense training<br />\nthe team will go through during<br />\nthat time. For the men, the<br />\nMAC's represent not only another chance to add to the<br />\nseemingly endless skein of MAC<br />\ntrophies, but one of the last<br />\nopportunities to qualify for the<br />\n'Division III championships.<br />\nThe Jays have already qualified in 20 individual events and<br />\nall three relays, but to date, only<br />\neight individuals hold those<br />\nhonors. Hopkins roared through<br />\ntheir meet with the University of<br />\nMaryland, but the Terps swam<br />\njust a bit harder, yielding the<br />\nfastest meet in the history of the<br />\ntwo schools.<br />\nLeading the Jays was Breaststroker Jon Blank, whose 200meter time of 2:05.8 crushed<br />\nthe UM pool record set by<br />\nOlympic Gold Medalist Duncan<br />\nGoodhew of Great Britain. Not<br />\nto be outdone by himself, Blank<br />\nreturned to Homewood to clock<br />\nthe 200 in 2:05.00 qualifying<br />\nfor the NCAA Division I nationals for the second year in a row.<br />\nLast season, Blank was the sole<br />\nDivision III swimmer to be<br />\nselected for Division I honors,<br />\nand this season looks like a<br />\nrepeat.<br />\nFreshman Robert Britanisky<br />\ngarnered a third-place finish in<br />\n<br />\nthe 200 backstroke, behind<br />\nHopkins' Bill Bender. Britanisky's time of 2:01.7 was his first<br />\nNational qualifying time, allowing him to travel to Oberlin,<br />\nOhio as the Jays take on Kenyon<br />\nCollege for the national title. .<br />\nBender's time of 1:58.7 in the<br />\n200 backstroke was outdone<br />\nonly by his identical time in the<br />\n200 individual medley. In this<br />\nevent. Bender was touched out<br />\nby one second by Maryland's<br />\nSanocki, whose time of 1:58.6<br />\nled the third-place finisher by<br />\nthree seconds.<br />\nIn the top action of the day,<br />\nthe 400 medley relay team of<br />\nBender, Blank, Doug Morgan,<br />\nand Harvey Allen put together a<br />\ntime of 3:31.70, which, although a half-second behind the<br />\nMaryland foursome, made the<br />\nJays the current top seed in<br />\nthe Division III competition.<br />\nThe differences between the<br />\nhalf-seconds were indeed great,<br />\nwith a loss in a relay yielding a<br />\n14-point difference, scored 7-0.<br />\nWhen the dust settled, the Jays<br />\nhad qualified in eleven events,<br />\nbut had lost 36-75.<br />\nEarlier in the day the<br />\nwomen had been defeated by<br />\nthe Terps, dropping their season<br />\nrecord to 7-7. The Hopkins<br />\nwomen returned to swim in the<br />\nMaryland State AIAW Championships, held at Towson State<br />\nover the weekend. The Jays<br />\nplaced fifth overall, but the<br />\nwomen turned in some solid<br />\ntimes.<br />\nIn the 500 'freestyle,<br />\nHeather Dick swam to a 5:16.27<br />\nfirst-place finish, while Ann<br />\n<br />\nAronowitz finished with a<br />\n5:30.58 mark. Senior Monika<br />\nBay was the overall leader<br />\nfor the Jays: she pulled in a first<br />\nplace finish in the 400 IM with a<br />\ntime of 4:47.63, also garnering<br />\nsecond spots in the 200 Butterfly, and 200 free, and the 200<br />\nIM. The 800-meter freestyle<br />\nrelay team of Gale Berkowitz,<br />\nAronowitz, Bay and Dick pulled<br />\nfor a 8:34.07 finish, picking up<br />\nthe second position in the<br />\nhard-fought race.<br />\nThe women completed their<br />\nhome schedule last night in a<br />\ndual meet with George Washington University. For the Hopkins<br />\nsquad, it is on to the MAC<br />\nChampionships at Widener; then<br />\na select few will train for the<br />\nAIAW Division III Nationals at<br />\nCoe College in Cedar Rapid,<br />\nIowa. Among these will be diver<br />\nTracey Stambaugh, whose score<br />\nof 371 points set a new University championship diving record.<br />\nChampioship diving differs from<br />\ndual meet diving in that it<br />\nincludes eleven dives instead of<br />\nsix. A repeat of a 371 dive would<br />\nmake Stambaugh one of the<br />\nmost impressive divers in the<br />\nMAC, if not in the nation.<br />\nFor the men, the MAC's are<br />\nnot the end of the road. This<br />\nyear, the Jays will again host the<br />\nJohns Hopkins Bumper Sticker<br />\nInvitational, which will be held<br />\nMarch 6-8.

After<br />\nreferring to San Francisco as the<br />\n\"Sodom and Gomorrah\" of the<br />\nnation, Dean Wycoff,spokesman<br />\nfor the Santa Clara Moral<br />\nMajority went on to say that San<br />\nFrancisco was also \"the armpit<br />\nof this perverted movement.\"<br />\nA little research brings<br />\nsome interesting facts to light.<br />\nIn the book of Genesis (18,<br />\n22-23), Abraham discusses the<br />\nimpending destruction of Sodom<br />\nand Gomorrah with God. God<br />\ntells Abraham, \"If I find' at<br />\nSodom fifty righteous in the<br />\ncity, I will spare the whole place<br />\nfor their sake.\" (18,26).

Since no one was to<br />\nlook upon the sight, our only<br />\naccount of the destruction is<br />\nsupplied by Abraham. The day<br />\nafter the destruction he looked<br />\nover the valley and saw that \"the<br />\nsmoke of the land went up like<br />\nthe smoke of a furnace.\"<br />\n(19,28).<br />\nThough the exact method<br />\nof destruction is unclear, it<br />\nseems that an earthquake is<br />\nthe most likely possibility.<br />\nThe same edition of the<br />\nTimes carried a story on the<br />\nimpending major earthquake<br />\nthat is expected to level California, if not drop it into the sea.<br />\nSo it would appear that God is<br />\ndissatisfied with California.<br />\nBut because biblical precedent is the mainstay of the<br />\nmoral movement, we can rest<br />\ncont. on p. 5<br /><br />\nyou were when I got rejected at Princeton,<br />\nbut everybody here is like that, so it's not<br />\nso bad.

Laura Rosenthal which appeared in last week's N-L, I<br />\nwould like to make the following statements.<br />\nThe \"D.U.'s Back\" poster<br />\nwhich you found \"sexist and<br />\noffensive \" displayed the rear<br />\nview of a woman whose buttocks were properly draped.<br />\nWhile I will not say that the<br />\nposter artistically expressed the<br />\nbeauty of the female back, it<br />\ncertainly was not graphically<br />\noffensive. The \"use of a naked<br />\n(sic) woman to advertise an<br />\nevent\" of which a naked woman<br />\n(stripper) is the central attraction seems proper, so I assume<br />\nyou feel that said stripper was<br /><br />\nexploited. Consider the facts:<br />\nA woman is paid to visually<br />\nstimulate a number of Hopkins<br />\nmen, a stimulation which we<br />\nmust agree served only to<br />\nmagnify their frustrations. I<br />\ncontest that the posters did not<br />\nexploit women, but aided a<br />\nwoman in her exploitation of<br />\nmen.<br />\nThe \"Banana Chasing the<br />\nDonut\" was indeed sexist because it suggested that women<br />\ncategorically are disinterested<br />\nin\u2014nay, fear \"social intercourse.\" I am worried by your<br />\ncomparison of this Victorian<br />\nconcept that women should fear<br />\nsex to the fear a man would have<br />\nof the very real danger posed by<br />\na \"knife-wielding donut.\" The<br />\nbelief that women should not<br />\nenjoy sex was instilled by men in<br />\norder to better control their<br />\nwives. In this era of ERA, the<br />\nsexual act is mutually enjoyable.<br />\nCastration destroys not only a<br />\nman's enjoyment, but also his<br />\nability to give pleasure to<br />\nwomen. Your comparison of<br />\nthe two would seem to indicate<br />\nthat you either espouse the<br />\nVictorian belief that women<br />\nshould fear sex (and remain<br />\nvirginal for their husbands), or<br />\nfear sex because of your own<br />\ninability to give and/or receive<br />\npleasure.<br />\nIn the future, please get<br />\nyour facts straight before using<br />\nsuch shocking words as \"naked\",<br />\ntake the time to contemplate<br />\nyour conclusions of who is being<br />\nexploited before you cry rape,<br />\nand finally, get some counselling<br />\nabout the archaic sexual hangups<br />\nwhich may be contributing to<br />\nyour frigidity.<br />\nA member of<br />\nthe Hopkins community<br /><br />\nConfusing Orifices<br />\nTo the Editor:<br />\nI must say that my heart has<br />\ngrown fonder of our fraternal<br />\norganizations in the absence of<br />\nthe exploitative posters to which<br />\nwe were subjected last year: hut,<br />\nthere's still a bit of non-sexist<br />\nground left to be traversed.<br />\nA banana chasing a doughnut?

Farina<br /><br />\nEcon Availability<br />\nTo the Editor:<br />\nIn his interesting comments<br />\nin the report of the Faculty<br />\nCurriculum Review Committee<br />\n(News-Letter, February 13th)<br />\nMr. David Einolf states that the<br />\nCommittee contained a member<br />\n(presumably faculty) from the<br />\nDepartment of Political Economy. This is false (he may have<br />\nmisread \"Political Science\").<br />\nIndeed, several of the faculty<br />\nof Political Economy (including<br />\nme) are on record in the General<br />\nAssembly as in disagreement<br />\nwith substantial sections of the<br />\ncommittee's report.<br />\nSince Mr. Einolf does not<br />\ndefine what he means by<br />\n\"courses for the non-major\"<br />\nit is difficult to know what to<br />\nmake of his allegation that<br />\nseveral (most?) departments do<br />\nnot offer such courses. In our<br />\ndepartment a course is considered to be explicitly for majors if<br />\nit has the two intermediate<br />\ncourses in theory (18.301-2)<br />\nas prerequisite. All our majors<br />\nmust take these latter two<br />\ncourses, although about twice<br />\nthat many students actually do<br />\ntake them.<br />\nFifteen of the<br />\nregular undergraduate lecture<br />\ncourses offered by the Department in 1980/81 do not require<br />\nthese<br />\nintermediate<br />\ntheory<br />\ncourses (these 15 do not include<br />\n18.301-2).<br />\nIt is true that all courses<br />\nexcept the Elements course<br />\n(18.1-2) do require the latter,<br />\nbut that surely is reasonable.<br />\nApparently, it is so perceived by<br />\nundergraduates, since enrollments in Elements typically run<br />\naround 250-300, ten to twelve<br />\ntimes the annual number of<br />\nmajors in economics.<br />\nFinally, the Department<br />\ndoes take care to include in the<br />\ncatalogue (which is prepared for<br />\ntwo years at a time) only those<br />\ncourses it can reasonably expect<br />\nto teach in those two years.

Now how can you<br />\nexpect a professor, of the<br />\nF.C.R.C., to listen to student<br />\ncomplaints if the students won't<br />\ntake the time to use their<br />\nquestionnaires in order to voice<br />\nthese oomlaints in print? If a<br />\nstudent reads a persuasive review- negative or positive-of a<br />\ncourse based on his peers'<br />\njudgements, he or she has<br />\na much better idea of what they<br />\nare getting themselves into.<br />\nI am not a fanatic; I know<br />\nthat there is no way to reasonably expect everyone to turn in<br />\ntheir evaluations. I am a realist,<br />\nthough, and it seems to be quite<br />\na real possibility that if there<br />\nremains such a persistent lack of<br />\nfeedback concerning what students think about their courses,<br />\nand how these courses could be<br />\nmodified, then it is about<br />\ndefinite that the situation with<br />\ncourse offerings and University<br />\npolicy can only get worse and<br />\nworse.<br /><br />\ntions illegal were unconstitutional in most cases. We cannot<br />\ngo back to the days of rusty<br />\ncoathangers and back-alley abortions!!!<br />\nI think that it will be news<br />\nto most students that Senator<br />\nHelms and Representatives Ashbrook, Hyde, Dornan and others<br />\nhave recently proposed various<br />\nforms of the Human Life<br />\nAmendment (HLA), a Constitutional Amendment which would<br />\nmake the ending of any pregnancy for any reason illegal.<br />\nEven if the life of the mother<br />\nwas in danger, an abortion<br />\nwould not be allowed.<br />\nAll forms of the HLA<br />\ndeclare that fertilized eggs and<br />\nfetuses are \"persons\" entitled to<br />\nthe same rights and responsibilities as an adult human being<br />\neven though these \"persons\" can<br />\nonly be seen under a microscope. This, of course, would<br />\nmake several very popular forms<br />\nof birth control against the law.<br />\nbirthBecause low-estrogen<br />\ncontrol pills and the Intrauterine<br />\nDevice (IUD) prevent the implantation of the fertilized eggs,<br />\nthey would be deemed \"abortifacients\" which deny the fertilized egg its \"right to life.\"<br />\nBy declaring that a fertilized<br />\negg is a \"person,\" the HLA<br />\nwould also bring fertilized eggs<br />\nand fetuses under laws defining<br />\nmurder, kidnapping and other<br />\ncrimes involving a person as a<br />\nvictim. It is highly likely that<br />\nthis will mean that every miscarriage or spontaneous abortion<br />\nmust be investigated to determine whether it was accidental<br />\nor intentional, thus subjecting<br />\nthe pregnant woman to criminal<br />\nprosecution. It is also likely that<br />\ncrimes against a pregnant woman<br />\nwill be a crime against two<br />\npeople and that women who<br />\nhave abortions and those that<br />\nhelp them obtain them would be<br />\nprosecuted for premeditated<br />\nmurder.<br />\nThe HLA is a massive<br />\nintrusion into people's personal<br />\nand private lives and we must<br />\nnot let it become a part of our<br />\nnation's Constitution!

A woman's body is her<br />\nown and no one has the right to<br />\nforce her to continue a pregnancy if it is not her desire to do<br />\nso. In 1973, the U.S. Supreme<br />\nCourt ruled abortions during the<br />\nfirst six months of pregnancy<br />\nlegal. The Supreme Court also<br />\nstated that laws making abor-<br /><br />\nvated woman who-in spite of<br />\nexcellence in her job-found<br />\nherself after 10 years in the<br />\ndead-end, low-paying position<br />\nin which all secretaries find<br />\nourselves.

It is<br />\nnot that a benevolent University,<br />\n(saying, \"Opps, sorry Marge, we<br />\ndidn't mean to deprive you of a<br />\ngrievance<br />\nprocedure!\"), has<br />\nsimply overlooked the fact that<br />\nwe have low salaries, inadequate<br />\ncompensation for overtime, and<br />\nno grievance process.<br />\nThe<br />\nUniversity's monetary interests<br />\nare opposed to addressing these<br />\nreal problems, and they will<br />\ncontinue without solution as<br />\ncont. on p. 8<br /><br />\n\u2022<br /><br />\n1r7-1<br />\nvre5 FicuoyEAR - two<br /><br />\na<br /><br />\nPAGE 6 / FEBRUARY 20, 1981<br /><br />\nStudent Protest Scheduled<br />\ncont.from p. 3<br />\nmad about the treatment we've<br />\nbeen getting,\" said graduate<br />\nstudent Neil Smith. \"Suskind<br />\nabsolutely refused to talk with<br />\nus, and he is the appeal process<br />\nhere.

The Johns<br />\nHopkins University is the adversary of its employees: nothing at<br />\nHopkins will change until secretaries, technicians, clerks, all<br />\nemployees, begin to deal with<br />\nAdministration, and deal with it<br />\nwith that in mind.<br />\nMaureen Martindale<br />\nFormer<br />\nJohns<br />\nHopkins<br />\nUniversity secretary<br />\nFormer member Johns Hopkins<br />\nEmployees' Assoc.<br /><br />\nOn To The Streets<br />\nTo the Editor:<br />\nI am writing in response to a<br />\nletter in your Feb. 6, 1980 issue<br />\nthat claims \"that WJHU is very<br />\nquickly being taken over by<br />\noutsiders\" and implies that Hopkins does not have a lot to say<br />\ninto who runs the station.\" The<br />\nauthor of that letter has not<br />\nonly mangled the English language, but has mangled the facts as<br />\nwell. Initially, only the students<br />\nand alumni of The Johns Hopkins University were allowed to<br />\nparticipate in the activities at<br />\nWJHU because WJHU was an<br />\norganization of the SAC. But<br />\nwhen WJHU received its FM<br />\nlicense, a decision was made by<br />\nthe WJHU Managing Board<br />\n(composed entirely of Hopkins<br />\nstudents) in conjunction with<br />\nthe Hopkins administration, to<br />\nmake WJHU a Uiliversity activity<br />\nmanaged and operated by students, rather than a \"student<br />\nactivity.\"<br />\nMembers of the<br />\ncommunity surrounding the Uni-<br /><br />\nversity had offered their services<br />\nto WJHU,and had begun helping<br />\nout around the station on an<br />\ninformal basis because they still<br />\ncould not officially become<br />\nmembers. As their contributions<br />\nbecame greater and the WJHU<br />\nstaff and management became<br />\nmore aware of the value of their<br />\nwork, it was decided to consider<br />\nand vote upon the issue of<br />\ncommunity members becoming<br />\nofficial members of the WJHU<br />\nstaff. The matter was discussed<br />\nand voted upon at a General<br />\nStaff meeting, and the majority<br />\nof the staff members in attendance voted in favor of allowing<br />\ncommunity members full voting<br />\nrepresentation. However, the<br />\ndecision did not rest solely with<br />\nthe student staff at the station.<br />\nDr. Muller's approval was required and susbsequently given.<br />\nThat decision was reached<br />\nbecause community members<br />\nhave become a vital part of<br />\nWJHU's operation and have<br />\nshown a sense of dedication and<br />\ninvolvement on a year-round<br />\nbasis that Hopkins students have<br />\nsometimes been hard put to<br />\nmatch. This is understandable<br />\nconsidering the course workload<br />\nthat students must bear, and the<br />\nvacation periods that are needed<br />\nto recover from it. But it creates<br />\na continual problem because<br />\nWJHU does indeed have to abide<br />\nby the .commitments it has<br />\nmade, first to Hopkins President<br />\nSteven Muller acting on the part<br />\nof the Trustees, and more<br />\nrecently to the Federal Governregulation<br />\nment (due<br />\nto<br />\nchanges), to stay on the air 365<br />\ndays a year.<br />\nEvery year at student vacation times, the Program Director<br />\nand music directors have had to<br />\nbeg and plead with student staff<br />\nmembers to try and stay during<br />\nat least part of the vacation to<br />\nkeep the station on the air the<br />\nrequired eighteen hours a day.<br />\nAnd each year, it has been a<br />\nskeleton staff of 20 or less<br />\nmembers that have managed to<br />\ncome in and help out, at least 60<br />\npercent of whom were community members (by actual count).<br /><br />\nAnd the backbone of that<br />\nskeleton staff has been 75 to<br />\n100 percent community members, also by actual count. After<br />\nall, would you be willing to give<br />\nup a trip home to New York, or<br />\nBoston or California, etc.just to<br />\nput your show on the air? And<br />\nthat brings up another important<br />\npoint. According to the admissions office, more than 75% of<br />\nthe undergraduate students at<br />\nHopkins are out-of-state students. Add to that number,<br />\nthose students from outside of<br />\nBaltimore, and you have relatively few students familiar with the<br />\nhistory, politics, or \"beat\" of<br />\nthis city. Yet it is the people of<br />\nthe City of Baltimore that<br />\nWJHU is obligated to serve. The<br />\nanonymous letter writer (ALW)<br />\nstates that \"the purpose of the<br />\nstation is to give students an<br />\nopportunity for having fun while<br />\nlearning some journalism skills.<br />\nI submit that the first purpose of<br />\nany licensed radio station is to<br />\nproduce quality programming<br />\nfor the entire community (for<br />\nwhich the students at Johns<br />\nHopkins are a measurable part),<br />\nand that other considerations_Are<br />\nsecondary, although they may<br />\nstill be of great importance. The<br />\ntwo people that ALW mentions<br />\nas seemingly dangerous are two<br />\nof the people that have been<br />\naround during vacations when<br />\nALW was probably basking in<br />\nthe sun somewhere. And since<br />\none must still be a Hopkins<br />\nstudent or alum to be a Managing Board member (until the<br />\nadministration decides otherwise), it should be noted that<br />\nthe Program Director is a student here.<br />\nAnd to top off the stupidity of<br />\nthe statements in ALW's ignominious letter, the News Director<br />\nwho is slanderously refered to as<br />\n\"a product of the Baltimore<br />\nHitler movement\" is as Jewish<br />\nas a bagel from a New York deli.<br />\nIn conclusion, I would also<br />\nlike to direct a comment to the<br />\nTrustees in regard to backing<br />\nthe proposed 13,720 watt station. (You blew it again, ALW.<br />\nIt's not 15,000 watts.) The<br /><br />\nFCC has recently taken action<br />\nagainst one or more college<br />\nstations to fight against just<br />\nwhat ALW states should be the<br />\npurpose of WJHU's existance.<br />\nThe students operating the stations were not trying to serve<br />\nthe greater community. They<br />\nwere operating the stations \"for<br />\nfun\". Maybe that's why the<br />\nCorporation for Public Broadcasting has taken to refering to<br />\nsome college stations as \"electronic sandboxes\". I hope no<br />\none allows that to happen here.<br />\nOh, and a hearty thanks to the<br />\ncommunity members at WJHU<br />\nfor a job well done!<br />\nJud French<br />\nFormer General Manager,<br />\nWJHU-FM<br /><br />\nthe fun of the other dogs.<br />\nThese innocent and ornamental creatures do no harm<br />\nwhile it is true that they are<br />\nsomewhat casual about their<br />\nnecessary bodily functions, still,<br />\nI must declare that their necessary leavings are less offensive<br />\nthan beer cans, discarded lunch<br />\nbags, and other rubbish carelessly dropped by their human<br />\nsuperiors.

An initial staff of five is expected in early<br />\nMarch. They will be temporarily housed in Rowland<br />\nHall until the Institute building is completed in 1983 or<br />\n1984. By May or June, 15 to 20 Institute staff members<br />\nwill be cramming the halls of Rowland. After that, the<br />\nstaff won't increase much until the Institute building is<br />\ncompleted.<br />\nThe Space Telescope is already under construction. It will be placed in orbit about 375 miles above<br />\nthe earth by the Space Shuttle in late 1984 or early<br />\n1985. The telescope will have a useful life of about 15<br />\nyears. Adjunct Professor William Fastie of the Physics<br />\ndepartment seemed to flinch slightly at the suggestion<br />\nthat the Space Telescope, like Skylab, might drop out of<br />\norbit and be destroyed. This is no longer a problem, he<br />\nasserts, because calculations of the earth's gravitational<br />\npull are now more accurate. In addition, with the Space<br />\nShuttle in operation, when and if the Space Telescope<br />\nwere pulled too close to the earth, the shuttle could<br />\nsimply go put it back where it belongs. (Fastie also<br />\npointed out that if the government had adequately<br />\nfunded the Space Shuttle project it would have probably<br />\nbeen operational in time to save the Skylab.) In addition to being able to adjust the Space Telescope's orbit,<br />\nthe Space Shuttle will enable NASA to repair the telescope in space, as well as replace obsolete equipment<br />\nwith more sophisticated equipment when and if desired.<br />\nThe Institute will be constructed on the Homewood west campus, west of San Martin drive. The site is<br />\nnorth of the Athletic Center. Thouse definite plans have<br />\nnot been made, the building will cover approximately<br />\n70,000 square feet, including parking. The present<br />\ndesign also had provisions for two 20,000-square-foot<br />\nextensions if the Institute needs to expand. The building will house a full time staff of about 140, 25 to 40 of<br />\nwhom will be professional astronomers. In addition to<br />\nthe full time staff, an estimated 200 astronomers are<br />\nexpected to visit and use the facilities annually.<br />\nThere will be no antennae at the Institute. All<br />\ncommunications between the Institute and the Space<br />\nTelescope will be handled through Goddard Space Flight<br />\nCenter in Greenbelt, Md. The information from the<br />\ntelescope will be relayed by one of two satellites to<br />\nGoddard, and then by cable from Goddard to the<br />\nInstitute. Directional information for aiming the telescope will be formulated at the Institute and relayed<br />\nthrough Goddard and one of the two satellites to the<br />\ntelescope.<br />\nThe Institute will be run by AURA, the Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy.

There are no plans for a Hopkins Department of Astronomy, but no one doubts that that element of the Physics department will grow.<br />\nThe working mechanics of the Institute were<br />\naptly described by William Fastie. According to Fastie,<br />\nthe Institute will be somewhat analogous to JHU as a<br />\nwhole. An advisory board of astronomers will judge<br />\nprojects for the telescope's use and decide what projects<br />\nto undertake and when. This is similar to the Academic<br />\nCouncil's purpose of choosing faculty, and to some<br />\ndegree directing the types of things to be studied.<br />\nHopkins will have no special privileges for use of the<br />\ntelescope; Hopkins scientists will have to submit proposals like everyone else.<br />\nThe Institute will be managed by AURA and the<br />\nfull time staff will be AURA personnel.

Funds for the other AURA observatories are<br />\nsupplied by the National Science Foundation.<br />\nWhen NASA requested proposals for operating<br />\nthe Institute, various consortia began looking around for<br />\npotential sites. Though one would like to believe that<br />\nHopkins actively sought out one of these consortia from<br />\nthe beginning, or vice versa, the actual impetus for<br />\nHopkins' involvement was somewhat different. Arthur<br />\nDavidsen of the Physics department explained that<br />\nduring a social dinner with the Director of AURA, the<br />\ndirector suggested that Hopkins might want to submit a<br />\nproposal. Davidsen then proceeded to test the Hopkins<br />\nenvironment to see if there really was an interest. Thus<br />\nbegan one of JHU's more fruitful endeavors.<br />\nWhy AURA chose Hopkins over five or six other<br />\ninstitutions is not certain. Davidsen suggests that a<br />\nnumber of things helped. The Baltimore locaiton<br />\npresented many advantages; close proximity to Goddard<br />\nSpace Flight may have been important. The annual cost<br />\nof cable rental between Homewood and Goddard is<br />\nabout $24,000, while a proposed site in San Diego<br />\nwould have raised the cost of cable rental to nearly $1<br />\nmillion annually. The proximity of a major airport was<br />\nundoubtedly helpful, as was the relatively low cost of<br />\nhousing in Baltimore. The cultural diversity of a city was<br />\nanother possible advantage.

The major advantage of<br />\nplacing a telescope in orbit is that it will not have a<br />\nblanket of atmosphere fuzzing its view of the sky. The<br />\nearth's atmosphere blots out extremely faint objects and<br />\nblurs those which we can observe, so most distant<br />\nobjects appear as almost featureless patches of light.<br />\nEven though the space telescope is smaller than the<br />\nlargest ground-based telescope, it will be the most<br />\noptically precise instrument ever created, with a resolution (ability to show fine detail) 105 times greater than<br />\nany ground instrument. Its accuracy in pinpointing a<br />\nsection of sky will go down to one 4000th of a second<br />\nof arc. (There are 180 degrees of arc from horizon to<br />\nhorizon, 60 minutes per degree, and 60 seconds per<br />\nminute.) Therefore, the space telescope will be accurate to 1/2592000000 of the sky, a precision far surpassing any device on earth. Mounted within the casing will<br />\nbe the optical portions of the telescope and a spectrograph, whose components are being tested here at<br />\nHopkins.<br />\nAs a tool for astronomy and astrophysics, the<br />\nspace telescope will be incomparable. One of the great<br />\nmysteries of astrophysic is the nature and origin of quasars.<br />\nQuasars (short for quasi-stellar objects) were first discovered with radio telescopes and have remained an<br />\nenigma to science ever since. Quasars are distant objects<br />\nwhich put out enormous amounts of energy--too much,<br />\nit seems, to have been produced by a normal galaxy.<br />\nBecause quasars are extremely distant objects, our only<br />\noptical pictures of them are fuzzy at best. Several<br />\nconjectures have been made on what the quasars are, but<br />\nall of these guesses really depend upon getting a clearer<br />\nlook at a quasar. Are quasars galaxies with enormous<br />\nblack holes in their nuclei? Do they represent an early<br />\nstage in galactic evolution? (Since light travels at a<br />\nfinite constant velocity and the quasars are uniformly<br />\ndistant, astronomers infer that quasars are relatively old<br />\nobjects.) Some fuzzy patches have been observed<br /><br />\naround quasars, thus leading to-the conjecture that they<br />\ncould be galaxies, but the fuzzy regions could also be gas<br />\nbetween us and the quasar. If it is indeed gas, then there<br />\nis more intergalactic matter than expected; if they are<br />\ngalaxies, then why haven't we observed any closer<br />\nquasars? The fuzzy regions around the quasars are<br />\nmoving away from us at a slower speed than the quasars<br />\nthemselves, which could imply that the fuzzy patches<br />\nare enormous amounts of gas being expelled from the<br />\nquasar. (Even though both the quasar and the gas are<br />\nmoving away from us, the slower-receding gas indicates<br />\nthat it is moving away relative to the quasar.) Everything concerning the quasars literally remains to be seen.<br />\nAnother subject of scrutiny for the space telescope which may in turn aid our understanding of<br />\nquasars are the Seyfert galaxies. Both the optical spectra<br />\nof the Seyfert galaxies and the optical/ultraviolet spectra<br />\nof the quasars indicate large, turbulent cauldrons of gas<br />\nheated by powerful ultraviolet sources, an indicator of a<br />\npossible black hole at the Seyfert's nucleus. Indeed,<br />\nSeyfert galaxies may be mini-quasars, but a clearer<br />\npicture of a Seyfert galaxy may dispell this theory.<br />\nSome galaxies are powerful radio sources, and it may be<br />\ndiscovered that they are the real astrophysical relatives<br />\nof the quasars.<br />\nBlack holes are a subject of constant interest for<br />\nastrophysicists, and naturally the space telescope will be<br />\ntrained on possible black holes in our neighborhood of<br />\nthe galaxy. Several nearby stars (such as the famous<br />\nCygnus X-1) are binary stars with invisible, massive<br />\ncompanions which are strong X-ray sources. Unseen<br />\ncompanion stars such\" as these are believed to be black<br />\nholes, and although by their very nature it is impossible<br />\nto get a picture of a black hole, a picture of a black hole<br />\nbinary system may show us a black hole's effects on the<br />\narea around itself and its visible companion, thus verifying the existence of black holes.<br />\nJust as we have been inferring the existence of<br /><br />\nblack holes without an actual \"picture\" of one, so have<br />\nwe inferred the existence of planets circling some nearby<br />\nstars. Stars which are suspected of having planetary<br />\nsystems (such as Barnard's Star) exhibit a characteristically uneven wobble, but because of the optical limitations of ground-based telescopes, it has been impossible<br />\nto see any planets. A planet is a dim object compared to<br />\nits sun, so it is blotted out by the brightness of its star.<br />\nBecause of the high resolution of the space telescope,<br />\nthough, it should be able to see a Jupiter-sized or larger<br />\nplanet if there is one there to see.<br />\nModern cosmology, the study of the universe as a<br />\nwhole, stands to be refined by the space telescope. In<br />\nthe 1920's, Edwin Hubble discovered a clear correlation<br />\nbetween the distance of a galaxy from us and how fast it<br />\nis receding from us. (The major basis for the belief that<br />\nthe universe is expanding is that all galaxies are moving<br />\naway from us.) There is a large range of error attached<br />\nto the Hubble constant (relation) which is caused by the<br />\nmargin of error in our measurements of distance to<br />\nnearby galaxies. The space telescope will be able to pick<br />\nout important reference stars within neighborhood<br />\ngalaxies and use them to get a more accurate measure<br />\nof distance to the galaxy. A by-product of the refinement of the Hubble constant will be better estimation of<br />\nthe age of the universe, whose equation includes the<br />\nHubble constant. The current estimate is 15 to 20<br />\nbillion years, but a more exact Hubble constant will<br />\nplace our finger closer to the exact figure.<br />\nThese are merely the highlights of the research to<br />\nbe done with the space telescope. Astronomers will be<br />\ntraining it on every interesting object in the heavens in a<br />\nmad dash to make the best use of their new toy. Without a doubt, the space telescope, which will be focus<br />\nof astrophysical research over the next two decades, is<br />\none of the most important tools to fall into the hands of<br />\npure science in recent times.<br /><br />\nPAGE 12 / FEBRUARY 20, 1981<br /><br />\nPLACEMENT<br />\nBUREAU<br />\nDATE<br /><br />\nFeb.20 7:00&amp; 11:00PM<br />\nFeb.21 9:00 P.M.<br />\n*** The Senior Class Film Series presents ***<br /><br />\n2/24/81<br />\n2/24/81<br />\n2/25/81<br />\n2/25/81<br />\n2/26/81<br />\n2/26/81<br />\n2/26/81<br />\n2/27/81<br />\n2/27/81<br />\n3/2/81<br />\n3/2/81<br />\n3/2/81<br />\n3/3/81<br />\n3/3/81<br />\n3/4/81<br />\n3/4/81<br />\n3/5/81<br />\n3/5/81<br />\n3/6/81<br />\n3/6/81<br /><br />\nORGANIZATION<br />\nGould Inc., Chesapeake Division<br />\nMaryland National Bank<br />\nBechtel Power Corporation<br />\nBethlehem Steel<br />\nWatkins Johnson Company<br />\nNUS Corporation<br />\nGulf Oil Company<br />\nTymnet Inc.<br />\nWard Machinery<br />\nSocial Security Administration<br />\nAddison-Wesley Publishing Company<br />\nBooz, Allen &amp; Hamilton<br />\nEDS Nuclear<br />\nScientific Atlanta<br />\nApplied Physics Laboratory<br />\nWestern Electric Company<br />\nGTE Sylvania<br />\nBendix Environmental Processing Group<br />\nUS Army Materials Development &amp;<br />\nReadiness Command<br />\nArmy Corps of Engineers<br /><br />\nMerryman Hall<br />\nThe Office of l<br />\no<br />\ni<br />\nr the Chaplain<br />\n\u2022<br />\niYitt4Ce(Dil iY()v1.1t<br />\n, ))Th<br /><br />\n4trie<br />\nWo3rds Friday Feb 20, 720 &amp; 1130<br />\nSalutiay Feb 21, 920<br />\nFantast Planet: Friday Feb. 20, WO<br />\nSEdirday Feb. 21, 700 &amp; 1120<br /><br />\nSkiver Halt<br />\nJohns Hopkins<br />\n!University<br /><br />\nStudents &amp; Sr. Citizens $1.50 w/I.D.<br />\nGeneral Admission $2.00<br /><br />\nDouble feature:<br />\n$2.50 students/ $3.00 general<br /><br />\nNEWS-LETTER / PAGE 13<br /><br />\nUnderstanding Shylock<br /><br />\nPBS Airs Shakespeare's Most Tragic Comedy<br />\nBY RICHARD SEAMON<br />\nThe Maryland Center for Public<br />\nBroadcasting will present The Merchant<br />\nof Venice Monday, February 23 from 8<br />\nto 11 p.m. One of Shakespeare's most<br />\npsychologically and dramatically complex<br />\nworks, this is the second production in<br />\nSeason Three of the on-going series,\"The<br />\nShakespeare Plays.\" The TV version shows<br />\nthat the play has lost none of its power to<br />\nquestion the values of a Christian<br />\nsociety, and the producers and directors<br />\nhave transplanted The Merchant from<br />\nstage to screen with beauty and clarity.<br />\nThose who grumble at the Internal Revenue Service may find comfort in<br />\nthe long history of the notion of exacting<br />\na pound of flesh for payment.

Not only does<br />\nthis city have a revitalized inner commercial core, but its orchestra and conductor have risen from the ashes and are<br />\nproviding blissfully high-quality music.<br />\nThe program began with the Mendel-<br /><br />\nBSO's Sergiu Comissiona<br /><br />\nssohn Fingal's Cave Overture, one of his<br />\nmore dramatic compositions and something that will grab the attention of even<br />\nthe most jaded symphony-goer. The<br />\norchestra blasted the piece with surprising<br />\nverve and finesse. Comissiona's conducting was a little faster than usual, but the<br />\norchestra experienced no significant<br />\nproblems in articulation. The horns,<br />\nusually the ensemble's weakest point,<br />\nwere especially forceful and, mercifully,<br />\non pitch. The strings also sounded better<br />\nthan usual; anyone who has heard the<br />\nBaltimore Symphony's Black and Decker<br />\nstring section of a few years ago will<br />\nwelcome this dramatic improvement.<br />\nMahler's Rucket Songs were scheduled<br />\nto follow the Mendelssohn overture, but<br />\nas mentioned the vocal soloist took ill<br />\nand the orchestra substituted the Elgar<br />\n'Cello Concerto in E Minor with cellisi<br />\nFrans Helmerson. Helmerson's playing<br />\nwas one of the evening's greatest joys; it<br />\nwas lush and resounding, yet not too<br />\ntechnical. Ordinarily the Elgar Cello<br />\nConcerto can be a typically boring hunk<br />\nof English bombast, especially with a<br />\nplodding conductor and the average<br />\nconcert cellist. But Helmerson gave the<br />\npiece the warmth and sublime beauty it<br />\nsorely needs, and Comissiona kept the<br />\nplayers going at a good clip to avoid the<br />\nusual drowiness.<br />\nThe second half of the program<br />\nfeatured Bloch's Sacred Service, a reduced version of the standard Jewish<br />\nSabbath service set to modern, although<br />\nhighly enjoyable, music. Unfortunately,<br />\nMr. Guinn's substitute, John Ostendorf,<br />\nwas hardly the cantor of everyone's<br />\ndreams. His voice tended to plop down<br />\nin the second row and stay there for all<br />\nbut the loudest passages. The Baltimore<br />\nSymphony chorus, on the contrary, sang<br />\nto perfection and gave this long piece just<br />\nenough liveliness to lessen the inevitablc<br /><br />\ntedium. The Sacred Service can get<br />\nboring after a while, as do most long<br />\nreligious pieces, but the music was worth<br />\nthe few lapses into dullness.<br />\nIf you have a chance to hear the<br />\nBaltimore Symphony, by all means go. It<br />\nis worth the trip, and is certainly worth<br />\nthe $2.50 for student rush tickets.<br />\nHowever, I suggest you hurry, since<br />\nwith the orchestra's rapid improvement<br />\ncheap seats probably won't be available<br />\nmuch longer.<br /><br />\nMobtown's NewBallet<br />\nBY DAVID M. EINOLF<br />\nThreatened with bankruptcy, facing massive cuts in state and federal<br />\nassistance, and disrupted by fire, the New<br />\nBaltimore Ballet has struggled to stay<br />\nalive. Since it started twenty years ago as<br />\nthe Maryland Ballet, Maryland's only<br />\nprofessional ballet company has managed<br />\nto continue providing quality dance<br />\nperformances, at an average of four a<br />\nyear.<br />\nIn August of 1979, the administrative offices of the Ballet were swept by<br />\na fire which destroyed records, sets, and<br />\ncostumes. Virtually abandoned by its<br />\nadministrative board, the Ballet suffered a<br />\nsteady decline until January of 1980,<br />\nwhen Charles F. Fischl was appointed<br />\nboth President and General Manager.<br />\nFischl was faced with a $400,000 deficit<br />\nand had only $55,000 in pledges and<br />\ngrants to rely on. Nevertheless, Fischl<br />\ndrove the Ballet forward, presenting the<br />\nworld premiere of Equus\u2014 The Ballet,<br />\nreplacing the entire professional staff of<br />\nthe Ballet, and bringing Alfonso Cata<br /><br />\nto Baltimore as the company's artistic<br />\ndirector.<br />\nWith these changes in management, Fischl reduced the deficit to<br />\n$170,000 by September 1980. Buoyed<br />\nby these efforts, the Ballet, now the<br />\nBaltimore Ballet, presented a new version<br />\nof The Nutcracker, choreographed by<br />\nCata, and set in Baltimore of the turn of<br />\nthe century. This production was well<br />\nreceived in Baltimore, as well as in<br />\nHagerstown and Roanoke, Virginia,<br />\nwhere it was taken on tour.<br />\nAlthough the outlook for the<br />\nBallet is starting to improve, it is by no<br />\nmeans rosy. Fischl described some of the<br />\nproblems he faces: \"Currently, I spend<br />\neighty percent of my time trying to cut<br />\ndown our deficit, and the rest on our<br />\nday-to-day affairs. It should be the other<br />\nway around\u2014I should be able to work<br />\nmore closely with Mr. Cata on our<br />\nprograms, and we should have no deficit.\"<br />\nOne of Fischl's prime concerns is<br />\nto build a following for ballet in Balticont. on p. 15<br /><br />\nPAGE 14 / FEBRUARY 20, 1981<br /><br />\nVillage Voice Editor At Homewood<br />\nBY DAVID NEWMAN<br />\nThe journalist, who is very chic,<br />\nbreakfasts on a sort of banana and sour<br />\ncream mix from his Cuisinart, daydreams<br />\nlazily about the play he will one day<br />\nwrite (Plato leaves a benign romance with<br />\nDavid Bowie to take up immoderately<br />\nwith Susan Sontag), ponders as he drives<br />\nhis Alfa with artistic abandon about what<br />\nwill replace ska as the Next Big Thing,<br />\nand, arriving at the offices of the Scarsdale Social Climber, sits down at his video<br />\nterminal and in a style that is both glib<br />\nand impervious begins his comment on<br />\nour times, entitled \"Self-consciousness-An Investigative Report.\"<br />\nDavid Schneiderman doesn't like<br />\nthe directions in which journalism is<br />\nmoving.<br />\nThe editor of New York's Village<br />\nVoice (and a late sixties alumnus of<br />\nHopkins and SAIS) spoke Wednesday at<br />\nHomewood on the \"Decline and Fall of<br />\nHe sees<br />\nEstablishment Journalism.\"<br />\n\"upscale journalism\" as its equally useless<br />\nreplacement.<br />\nSchneiderman's News-Letter experience may have given him a somewhat distorted picture of establishment<br />\njournalism. During his 1965-66 tenure as<br />\nnews editor, the paper published mock<br />\nMan of the Year awards, commending for<br />\ntheir meritorious deeds three mass<br />\nmurderers and Lyndon B. Johnson.<br />\nSomewhat less than pleased, University<br />\npresident Milton S. Eisenhower ordered<br />\nthe N-L's co-editors suspended and<br />\nthreatened Schneiderman with a similar<br />\nfate. Undaunted (in fact, rather pleased),<br />\nthe dedicated journalists protested that<br />\ntheir freedom of the press had been<br />\nabridged. Eisenhower, not known as a<br />\nconstitutional law scholar, snapped, \"it's<br />\nonly a house organ.\"<br />\nSince then, the relationship<br />\nbetween the power and the press has<br />\nbecome even more twisted. Using the<br />\nNew York Times as his model, Schneidman traced the transition from its role as<br />\nservant of the powerful to servant of the<br />\nThe Times that<br />\nupwardly mobile.<br />\nSchneiderman went to work for in 1970(as<br />\na summer news clerk) was still very much<br />\nthe friend of the government-business<br />\ncomplex, championing the old values<br />\nof \"civility, moderation, and civility.\"<br />\nWith the publication of the Pentagon<br />\nPapers in 1971, the Times broke with<br /><br />\nthat establishment for the first time.<br />\nRichard Nixon had already been president<br />\nthree years, and he was busy tearing<br />\ndown the inner sanctum he could never<br />\nbecome part of. The Times could no<br />\nlonger cover an establishment that didn't<br />\nexist.<br />\nWhen economic realities caught<br />\nup with the Times\u2014circulation was<br />\ndropping and they hadn't upgraded their<br />\nproduction or marketing techniques\u2014it<br />\nseemed time for a change. \"They looked<br />\nto Clay Felker (of New York magazine)<br />\nwho said 'look to the people who spend<br />\nmoney to be chic.' Felker defined that<br />\nwhole thing\u2014eat at the right places,<br />\nbuy throw pillows and Cuisinarts. The<br />\nadvertisers loved it, the money came<br />\n3ouring in, and the Times was saved.\"<br />\nThe result is that the Times has<br /><br />\nbecome a prisoner of its own upscale<br />\nreadership. \"Today, the Times publishes<br />\nmore articles on food than on those who<br />\nare poor; it really ignores the New York's<br />\n40% minority population; it is ignoring<br />\nsocial problems.\"<br />\nThe criticism seems double<br />\nedged\u2014 the old guard wasn't any good<br />\nbecause it was a partner, not a critic, of<br />\nthe power elite, and the new guard hasn't<br />\neven got the partner status, only its<br />\ntrappings. Schneiderman sees neither of<br />\nthese as properly befitting the newspaper,<br />\n\"Newspapers must be ceaselessly querrelous and bellicose,\" H.L.Mencken intoned forty years ago\u2014Schneiderman's<br />\nown efforts echo this. At the Voicg the<br />\nlack of pretense about objectivity has<br />\nalways been a haven to political writers-\"I'll print just about anything,\" Schneiderman says, \"as long as it's said well. It's<br />\nnot the job of newspapers to reflect<br /><br />\nFlawed Debut<br /><br />\nU2'c Boys:Hard Pop<br />\nBY GEORGE YATCHISIN<br /><br />\nHey rustics and connoisseurs of<br />\nauthentic music!<br />\nHere's a weekend<br />\nhighlight for you!<br />\nThe Baltimore Folk Music Society<br />\nwill present a concert of South American<br />\nmountain music by RUMISOIVKO Satur<br />\nday, Feb. 21, at 8:30 p.m. at Lovely<br />\nLane Methodist Church, 2200 St. Paul<br />\nStreet. Rumisonko is a quartet consisting<br />\nof Carlos Arrien, Alfredo Escobar,<br />\nRicardo Diaz, and Renes Iribarren. They<br />\nplay the music of the Quechua and<br />\nAymara Indians, who inhabit the highlands of Bolivia, Chile, Peru and Argen.<br />\ntina, on the charango (a mandolinlike<br />\ninstrument), the quena(a reed flute) the<br />\npan-pipes, the botnbo lu guero (a drum),<br />\nand the guitar.<br />\ntin*SiOn is $3,00.<br /><br />\nIt is generally fashionable to shoot<br />\ndown any group that gets too much<br />\nadvance press, i.e. the violent reaction the<br />\nGang of Four suffered from the press<br />\nafter the initial raves. U2's Boy hit<br />\nAmerican shores after the British music<br />\npress went beserk over it, and one can<br />\nalready hear the axes sharpening. Yet<br />\nBoy is a good album, if not a great one,<br />\nand the scary thing is the promise of what<br />\nis not delivered on this disc. Since all<br />\nmembers of the group are under 21,<br />\nmusical history could be rewritten if this<br />\nact gets itself together.<br />\nU2 is made up of vocalist Bono<br />\nVox, guitarist \"the Edge,\" bassist Adam<br />\nClayton, and drummer Larry Mullen.<br />\nThe group's instruments and its use of<br />\nlyrical guitar work would normally cause<br />\none to say they are just another progressive rock aberration. But this is far from<br /><br />\nMerchant of Venice<br /><br />\nFlesh Merchants And Marriage<br /><br />\ncont. from p. 13<br />\nhe is a careful businessman and a harshly<br />\nloving father who seeks revenge against<br />\nthe society that has treated him like a<br />\ndog. In the end, we neither pity nor<br /><br />\nVillage Voice editor David Schneiderman<br />\npopular opinion. Their job is to ferret<br />\nout opinions, no matter how popular or<br />\nunpopular they may be.\"<br />\nHow often does his own paper<br />\nreflect that?<br />\n\"We're gadflies\u2014sometimes we're<br />\nright and sometimes we're wrong,\" and<br />\nthen remembering his own views about<br />\nthe rest of the press, \"I'd rather be a<br />\ngadfly than a carnpfollower.\"<br /><br />\ndespise Shylock\u2014we understand him<br />\ninstead.<br />\nThe money enables Bassanio to<br />\ngain his love in Belmont, and his friend<br />\nGratiano successfully woos Nerissa at the<br />\nsame time. But in Venice, the balance of<br />\nAntonio's fate is swinging downward; all<br />\nthe news of his shipping ventures tells of<br />\nfailure. Enraged that his daughter Jessica<br />\nelopes with a gentile, and a friend of<br />\nAntonio's, Shylock determines to have<br />\nhis pound of flesh and goes to court with<br />\na knife and scale to get it.<br />\nThe court.scene of Act Four, with<br />\nall the main characters in open confrontation, brings out the highest quality of<br />\nacting in this production. Portia's character blossoms when she disguises herself<br />\nas a lawyer; as a man she need not spare<br />\nher sharp wit and depth of feeling. In the<br />\nmost tragic note ever sounded in a<br />\nShakespeare comedy, as Antonio stoically<br />\nlooks away from the knife poised before<br />\nhis chest, Shylock tumbles from his<br />\ngreatest triumph to his nadir. It seems<br /><br />\nthat the court will uphold his bloody<br />\nrevenge against the Christian world, but<br />\nhe ends up down on his knees, robbed of<br />\nhis money, his daughter, and his religion.<br />\nAct Five softens some of the<br />\nharshness of Shylock's fate. The three<br />\ncouples that form during the play come<br />\ntogether at Belmont in quiet scenes laced<br />\nwith music, and the power of love is reasserted. Nonetheless, much of the play's<br />\npower depends on this tension between<br />\ntragic and comic elements.<br />\nThe skillful intertwining of characters' fates made for a pleasant three<br />\nhours. Opulent costumes, subtle lighting,<br />\nand intelligent directing made this production delightful to watch, whether or<br />\nnot one is familiar with the play. Thanks<br />\nto Warren Mitchell's performance as<br />\nShylock, the TV version will remain<br />\ndistinct from and comparable to stage<br />\nversions starring the likes of Laurence<br />\nOlivier and George C. Scott. In short,<br />\nthe broadcast itself, as well as Shakespeare's play, is a work of art.<br /><br />\nthe case.<br />\nTake the opening cut of the<br />\nalbum I Will Follow . It begins with a<br />\nperverted set of Chuck Berryish guitar<br />\nchords and moves on to a melody carried<br />\nby Vox's awesomely powerful voice,<br />\nwhich betrays not a day of his youth.<br />\nThis isn't New Wave, this isn't new<br />\nanything\u2014 it's damn near pop. Yet, if it is<br />\npop, it's a hard pop with intelligence in<br />\nits instrumentation and no sugar coating<br />\nin the lyrics. And so goes the album.<br />\nThe hardest thing to do is not to<br />\nrave about the Edge. At the age of 19 he<br />\nis a guitarist to contend with, finding a<br />\nstrange style which combines elements of<br />\nMark Knopfler, Joe Walsh, Dave Gilmour,<br />\nand even Mick Ralphs in his Mott the<br />\nHoople days. His name is perfect, for the<br />\nEdge is what he is to U2.<br />\nEven the lyrical content of the<br />\nalbum has its moments. Boy is the title<br />\nfor a good reason: it is an album of youth<br />\ngrowing old, of that awful time between<br />\nboyhood and manhood.<br />\nThe sides<br />\nhave different themes: side one conveys<br />\nagony, fear, and adolescent rebellion<br />\nwhile the flip side's message is hope,<br />\nfantasy, and fame. The urgency felt in<br />\nVox's vocals is especially real and convincing, since it is so close to his own experience.<br />\n\"Twilight\" is clearly the gem of<br />\nthe album, both lyrically and musically.<br />\nIt is a metaphor of growing up, and when<br />\nVox sings, \"My body grows and grows,/<br />\nIt frightens me you know./ The old man<br />\ntried to walk me home./ I thought he<br />\nshould have known,\" you know he means<br />\nit. U2 manages much more depth on this<br />\ncut than their three instruments should<br />\nallow, but the standout is the Edge's<br />\nguitar solo. Sparse and lean, it means as<br />\nmuch to the song as the lyric.<br />\nWhile \"Twilight\" may be the most<br />\naccessible tune of the album, \"Shadows<br />\nand Tall Trees\" is the hardest to understand. The musical roots of this song are<br />\nnumerous--from the Lou Reedish mood<br />\nto the Police-like guitar work, from the<br />\nPeter Gabriel-like paranoia to the Love<br />\nstyle drumming. It doesn't all work,<br />\nhowever, particularly the enigmatic lyrics<br />\nwhich express yearning for fame. Nevertheless, the song does not lack for ambicont. on p. 15<br /><br />\nNEWS-LETTER / PAGE 15<br /><br />\nNew Baltimore Ballet<br /><br />\nSuccessful Season Bodes Well For The Future<br />\ncontinued from p. 13<br />\nmore. \"If the adminstration of the Ballet<br />\nhad considered this fifteen years ago,\" he<br />\nsaid, \"they may have cultured a large<br />\nenough audience, and we would have no<br />\nproblems. We are trying th reach out into<br />\nthe community with our programs. We<br />\ndance in schools and may reach as many<br />\nas 100,000 children in the coming year.\"<br />\nFischl points out that children are<br />\nnot the only target of the Ballet's programs: \"In May we are going to do a<br />\nseries of park performances, something<br />\nwhere you can bring a six-pack and some<br />\nchicken, and watch the Ballet.\" Additional dance programs have been planned<br />\nfor hospitals and the State Penitentiary,<br />\nthe. first prison performance in five years.<br />\nFischl realizes that the first step on the<br />\nroad to security is a strong supscription<br />\nprogram with guaranteed performances<br />\nand locations. The Ballet has been<br />\nplagued by problems in booking halls and<br />\ninopportune time changes made by the<br />\nowners. The company favors Goucher's<br />\nKraushaar Auditorium, but would prefer<br />\na more central location. In addition,<br />\nplans for a fully orchestrated ballet cannot be realized at Goucher due to the<br />\nabsence of a pit. The Ballet has cast<br />\nlonging eycs at Hopkins' own Shriver<br />\nHall, but has little hope of performing<br />\nthere regularly, since the hall is usually<br />\nbooked by the Office of Special Events<br />\nand the student weekend film series.<br />\nDespite the other problems, artis\u2022 tic director Cata is surrounded by a loyal<br />\ngroup of young performers and reliable<br />\nfriends from the ballet world. Friends of<br />\nFisch! and Cata have helped the Baltimore Ballet to its feet so that even<br />\nworking with a tight budget, the Ballet<br />\nhas developed a much improved program.<br /><br />\nThe Winter Repertory Program,<br />\nwhich ended last week, included six<br />\nvaried presentations choreographed by<br />\nCata and a host of talented guests. The<br />\nprogram was led by \"Valse Fantasie,\"<br />\nchoreographed by George Balanchine of<br />\nthe New York City Ballet. This was<br />\nfollowed by Deborah Zall's \"Pastorale,\"<br />\nan abstract dance. \"Pastorale\" was<br />\ndanced barefoot, and as a result lacked<br />\nsome of the classic postures of the<br />\nballet, a lack which was made up for by<br />\nthe movement of dancers Ken Whites,<br />\nDenis Johnston, and Bruce Steivel. While<br />\n\"Pastorale\" was dominated by the men,<br />\nBalanchine's \"Tchaikovsky Pas de Deux\"<br />\nwas heightened by the performance of<br />\nDiane Nelson, who eclipsed partner Jacob<br />\nNielsen in a well-choreographed and lively<br />\nduet.<br /><br />\nU2's Hit US Shores<br />\ncontinued from p. 14<br />\ntion<br />\nThe running of \"An Cat Dubh\"<br />\ninto \"Into the Heart\" on side one best<br />\ndescribes what happens to Boy. \"An Cat<br />\nDubh\" is the mood piece of the album-dark, ominous, again pulled from the<br />\nGabriel bag of paranoia. The frantic<br />\ndrumming, screeching guitar, and bitterness in the vocal all somehow add up to a<br />\nrather pretty melody, but then the song<br />\njust runs too long.<br />\n\"Into the Heart\" is in a way the<br />\ncatharsis after \"An Cat Duhb,\" but it still<br />\nis a little flat. Only two minutes long, it<br />\nseems interminable; somehow you've<br /><br />\nheard it all before. No matter how<br />\nallusive U2 is to other groups, it is most<br />\nallusive to itself; the material doesn't<br />\nrun thin, it runs familiar.<br />\nWhere U2 will go from here is<br />\nhard to say. Boy is a competent debut<br />\nalbum, yet still seriously flawed, in the<br />\nnature of Greetings from Asbury Park,<br />\nN.J., Jackson Browne, or The Boomtown<br />\nRats. U2 is just one small sapling among<br />\nall the tall trees of the musical forest, yet<br />\nthere is an intangible something about<br />\nthem that makes one wonder what the<br />\nfuture will bring. With the ambition they<br />\ndisplay here, one can hope for and expect<br />\nimprovement with age.<br /><br />\nThe program continued with a<br />\ntriplet of \"balleticized\" tangos choreographed by Cata. \"Tangos\" highlighted<br />\nthe talents of Allison Gonzalez, who<br />\ncould pose equally well in the light and<br />\nout of it. The music of \"Tangos\" was<br />\nupbeat, and the dance was well choreographed, save for Cata's dependence on<br />\nsexual sight gags.<br />\nAfter an intermission, the viewer<br />\nwas served the piece de resistance, John<br />\nClifford's Charleston, a roaring revival of<br />\nthe dance that swept the Jazz Age. In<br />\nthis, sexual sight gags were effective in<br />\ncapturing the decadence of flappers,<br />\ngangsters, and<br />\nburlesque<br />\nqueens.<br />\n\"Charleston\" was more an impressionistic<br />\ndance than a ballet, but the performance<br />\nof the Company made this an enjoyable<br />\nendpoint for the program. Once again,<br />\nDenis Johnston was superb, this time in<br />\nhis role as the \"come-on king\". in a<br />\nnumber entitled 'If I Could Be With You<br />\nOne Hour Tonight.\" Other exceptional<br />\nperformances came from Kathleen Smith<br />\nand Bruce Steivel, whose \"Snowy Morning Blues\" so well depicted the return<br />\nhome from a long night at the speakeasy.<br />\nExcellent<br />\ncostumery from<br />\nArdith<br />\nHaddow added much to the performance.<br />\nThe Ballet will continue to<br />\npresent its brand of dance, next in their<br />\nSpring Repertory program, which will<br />\ninclude<br />\nBalanchine's<br />\n\"Concerto<br />\nBarocco\", Cata's \"Sweet Carman,\" and a<br />\nworld<br />\npremiere of a Jean-Pierre<br />\nBonnefous performance.

With<br />\njust one game reamining, the<br />\nJays have a record of 12-11.<br />\nNikic and Tom<br />\nNick<br />\nTessitore provided the scoring<br />\npunch for the Jays as they<br />\navenged an earlier 85-67 loss to<br />\nHaverford.

Nikic<br />\nfinished with a season-high 31<br />\npoints (14 in the first half and<br />\n17 in the second half). It was<br />\nhis best offensive performance<br />\nof the season and the most<br />\npoints scored in a game by a<br />\nBlue Jay this season.

The nearly two-week<br />\nbreak between the Glassboro<br />\nmeet and the MAC Championship belies the intense training<br />\nthe team will go through during<br />\nthat time. For the men, the<br />\nMAC's represent not only another chance to add to the<br />\nseemingly endless skein of MAC<br />\ntrophies, but one of the last<br />\nopportunities to qualify for the<br />\n'Division III championships.<br />\nThe Jays have already qualified in 20 individual events and<br />\nall three relays, but to date, only<br />\neight individuals hold those<br />\nhonors. Hopkins roared through<br />\ntheir meet with the University of<br />\nMaryland, but the Terps swam<br />\njust a bit harder, yielding the<br />\nfastest meet in the history of the<br />\ntwo schools.<br />\nLeading the Jays was Breaststroker Jon Blank, whose 200meter time of 2:05.8 crushed<br />\nthe UM pool record set by<br />\nOlympic Gold Medalist Duncan<br />\nGoodhew of Great Britain. Not<br />\nto be outdone by himself, Blank<br />\nreturned to Homewood to clock<br />\nthe 200 in 2:05.00 qualifying<br />\nfor the NCAA Division I nationals for the second year in a row.<br />\nLast season, Blank was the sole<br />\nDivision III swimmer to be<br />\nselected for Division I honors,<br />\nand this season looks like a<br />\nrepeat.<br />\nFreshman Robert Britanisky<br />\ngarnered a third-place finish in<br /><br />\nthe 200 backstroke, behind<br />\nHopkins' Bill Bender. Britanisky's time of 2:01.7 was his first<br />\nNational qualifying time, allowing him to travel to Oberlin,<br />\nOhio as the Jays take on Kenyon<br />\nCollege for the national title. .<br />\nBender's time of 1:58.7 in the<br />\n200 backstroke was outdone<br />\nonly by his identical time in the<br />\n200 individual medley. In this<br />\nevent. Bender was touched out<br />\nby one second by Maryland's<br />\nSanocki, whose time of 1:58.6<br />\nled the third-place finisher by<br />\nthree seconds.<br />\nIn the top action of the day,<br />\nthe 400 medley relay team of<br />\nBender, Blank, Doug Morgan,<br />\nand Harvey Allen put together a<br />\ntime of 3:31.70, which, although a half-second behind the<br />\nMaryland foursome, made the<br />\nJays the current top seed in<br />\nthe Division III competition.<br />\nThe differences between the<br />\nhalf-seconds were indeed great,<br />\nwith a loss in a relay yielding a<br />\n14-point difference, scored 7-0.<br />\nWhen the dust settled, the Jays<br />\nhad qualified in eleven events,<br />\nbut had lost 36-75.<br />\nEarlier in the day the<br />\nwomen had been defeated by<br />\nthe Terps, dropping their season<br />\nrecord to 7-7. The Hopkins<br />\nwomen returned to swim in the<br />\nMaryland State AIAW Championships, held at Towson State<br />\nover the weekend.

Senior Monika<br />\nBay was the overall leader<br />\nfor the Jays: she pulled in a first<br />\nplace finish in the 400 IM with a<br />\ntime of 4:47.63, also garnering<br />\nsecond spots in the 200 Butterfly, and 200 free, and the 200<br />\nIM. The 800-meter freestyle<br />\nrelay team of Gale Berkowitz,<br />\nAronowitz, Bay and Dick pulled<br />\nfor a 8:34.07 finish, picking up<br />\nthe second position in the<br />\nhard-fought race.<br />\nThe women completed their<br />\nhome schedule last night in a<br />\ndual meet with George Washington University. For the Hopkins<br />\nsquad, it is on to the MAC<br />\nChampionships at Widener; then<br />\na select few will train for the<br />\nAIAW Division III Nationals at<br />\nCoe College in Cedar Rapid,<br />\nIowa.
