The City Interstate<br />\nDepartment had also been<br />\ninvolved.<br />\nWilliams said the process of<br />\nchange began after problems with<br />\nthe road were brought to public<br />\nattentio..1 by the News-Letter,<br />\nwhich focused on the high in-<br />\n<br />\ncidence of pedestrian accidents in<br />\nthe center portions of Charles<br />\nStreet.<br />\nHe mentioned that, at the time,<br />\nhe played a major role in placing<br />\nmany of the signs and markings<br />\nto notify persons about the<br />\nunusual pattern of traffic flow.<br />\nOne possibility the Commission discussed was to make double southbound lanes by removing the divider and completely<br />\nseparating the north and southbound traffic. Unfortunately, the<br />\nBureau of Highways and the<br />\nHomewood community were<br />\nboth opposed to the idea because<br />\nit would have to radically alter the<br />\nhistorical configuration of<br />\nCharles Street and could be quite<br />\nexpensive to implement.<br />\nAccording to Williams, exhaustive studies were done to<br />\nmeasure the capacity of Charles<br />\nStreet southbound and to consider<br />\nthe importance of destinations<br />\nalong that way. Officials then<br />\ndecided, given the traffic volume,<br />\nto close the second southbound<br />\nlane for all but four hours of the<br />\nday, assuming a certain percentage of drivers would adjust their<br />\nhabits.<br />\nThe University received<br />\nrecommendations at that time to<br />\nput in an enormous number of<br />\nwarning signs, directed more at<br />\npedestrians than at motor traffic,<br />\nhighlighting the legitimate<br />\ncrosswalks.

It heard that the<br />\nprogressive populism of the Rev. Jesse Jackson is<br />\napparently hotter than Nintendo at Christmas.<br />\nThese phenomena, as well as a presentation of<br />\nJackson's platform, were addressed by Vincente<br />\nNavarro Sunday in a lecture sponsored by the Office of the Chaplain.<br />\nNavarro served as a Jackson policy advisor for<br />\nthe 1988 Presidential campaign, was a member of<br />\nthe 1988 Democratic Platform Committee, and was<br />\na Maryland delegate to the Democratic Convention<br />\nin Atlanta. He now serves on the Maryland Rainbow Coalition Steering Committee and is Professor<br />\nof Health and Public Policy at the School of Hygiene<br />\nand Public Health.<br />\nThe lecture had been advertised as a talk on why<br />\nGovernor Michael Dukakis(D-Mass.) and Senator<br />\nLloyd Bentsen(D-Texas) lost their run for the White<br />\nHouse. Though the lecture was titled \"Why<br />\nDukakis Lost the Election,\" Navarro touched on<br />\nthis subject only briefly in his talk.<br />\nHe spent the bulk of his lecture endorsing what<br />\nhe called \"the most progressive Democratic platform since the New Deal of the Thirties, \"crediting<br />\nJackson's campaign as the impetus behind what he<br />\nsaw as the Democratic Party's move to the left.<br />\n<br />\nNavarro faulted Dukakis and Bentsen's movement<br />\naway from Jackson's policies and the platform put<br />\nforth by the Democrats in Atlanta as reasons for the<br />\nticket's sharp decline in the polls last fall and its<br />\neventual defeat. Navarro contended that only when<br />\nDukakis \"rediscovered his populist roots\" did he<br />\nregain some momentum in the campaign. But, alas,<br />\nthat discovery came too late.<br />\nAccording to Navarro, Dukakis's apparent move<br />\nto the political right cost him the election. Navarro<br />\nprovided statistics and polls to support his contention that the majority of Americans support an expansion of government support of social programs.<br />\nIf this working class group could be mobilized into<br />\na voting coalition, he said, then its role in the next<br />\nPresidential election would indeed be powerful.<br />\nNavarro advised the Democratic Party to follow<br />\nJackson's lead and target the blue-collar vote with<br />\nconsistent populist rhetoric.<br />\nThe question-and-answer period following the<br />\nlecture was for all intents and purposes a Jesse<br />\nJackson rally. One audience member would stand<br />\nup and praise Jackson. Others would then voice their<br />\nagreement. Before the lecture broke up, Navarro<br />\nleft a parting message: Jackson, he said, is the future<br />\nof the Democratic Party, and if the Democrats wish<br />\nto recapture the White House, they should follow<br />\nhis lead to the left.<br />\n<br />\nNEWS BRIEF<br />\nFive-Year Plan forces University to 'reluctantly' shut Chesapeake Bay Institute by 1991<br />\nCourtesy of News and<br />\nInformation<br />\nHopkins has decided to<br />\nphase out and close by<br />\nDecember 31, 1991 the<br />\nChesapeake Bay institute, an<br />\nestuarine and oceanographic<br />\nresearch facility whose staff<br />\nis located in Shady Side,<br />\nMaryland, and at the<br />\nHomewood campus in<br />\nBaltimore.<br />\nUniversity officials said they<br />\narrived at the decision reluctantly after determining that it<br />\nwould be too costly to, main-<br />\n<br />\ntain the institute as a first-rank<br />\nresearch enterprise.

CBI's researchers raise<br />\na substantial sum of money in<br />\nsponsored research, amounting this year to $1.9 million<br />\nin research contracts and an<br />\n<br />\nadditional $400,000 in indirect<br />\ncost recoveries. However, that<br />\nsupports only about eighty<br />\npercent of the institute's $2.8<br />\nmillion budget.<br />\nThe decision will affect fifteen researchers and twentyfive senior and support staff<br />\npersonnel.

Due to scheduling<br />\nconflicts, as reported last week,<br />\ntonight's Hoppy Hour will be one of only five.<br />\nNot only does the overburdened Glass<br />\nPavilion underscore a need for more<br />\ngathering places on campus, but it interrupts what has become a Friday afternoon tradition\u2014to enjoy a relaxed atmosphere in which different sectors of<br />\nthe Hopkins community, that is, faculty, graduate students, administration,<br />\nand undergraduates can interrelate. This<br />\nmingling process, difficult to achieve<br />\nunder any circumstances, has been<br />\nfacilitated in the past by Hoppy Hour's<br />\nreliability and continuity. The \"coincidences\" that led to the lack of booking for the Glass Pavilion are indeed<br />\nunhappy ones.<br />\nBut scheduling difficulties are, in a<br />\nreal sense, the least of the problems facing Hoppy Hour this semester. The<br />\nHour was a direct response to (lest we<br />\nbe blinded by Five-Year Plan<br />\nbrouhahas) a major finding of the<br />\nHuman Climate Task Force Report.<br />\nThe report citea \"artificial barriers\"<br />\nwhich both faculty/administration and<br />\nstudents felt existed among them. Hoppy Hour was to be the neutral turf, ,<br />\nwhere non-academic and non-bureaucratic introductions could be made, and<br />\nthe firct blows to the \"barriers\" could<br />\n<br />\nbe struck.<br />\nHowever, after a promising first-year<br />\nattendance of a broad cross-section of<br />\nthe community, this year it has been difficult to encourage faculty and administration to participate. Despite<br />\ntireless efforts to draw them in, such as<br />\nweekly reminders and invitations to cosponsor specific Fridays, faculty and administration were not lured to the Glass<br />\nPavilion on these afternoons. Most<br />\nfrustratingly, when the HOP chose to<br />\nrecognize different academic departments, often the very professors whose<br />\nturn it was to be recognized failed to appear; key administrative officials (you<br />\nknow who you are) have been no-shows<br />\nas well. Student attendance, however,<br />\nhas been booming, regardless of departmental liaisons.<br />\nThe fundamental irony underlying<br />\nthis crisis is that we have in Hoppy Hour<br />\na relatively inexpensive means of correcting a serious problem at Homewood\u2014<br />\nclimate. As such, Hoppy Hour should<br />\nbe particularly attractive to the Hopkins<br />\nadministrators accustomed to crying<br />\n\"deficit\" and dismissing more costly<br />\nproposals. In this instance, all that is required to ameliorate the lack of communication is participation. And if this<br />\ncondition is not fulfilled, all of the<br />\nwords of support pledged in the past to<br />\nan improved climate amount to nothing<br />\nmore than perfunctory lip service paid<br />\nto revenue-raising undergraduates.<br />\n<br />\nthat one would expect in return?<br />\nWith a reduction in faculty expenditures and a sizeable increase<br />\nin undergraduate enrollment over<br />\nfive years, what effect will there<br />\nbe on the number of faculty<br />\navailable for teaching'? This goes<br />\nhand in hand with our program of<br />\nfaculty advising and its inability<br />\nfor the most part to be an effective resource for students to use,<br />\ndue to either poor structuring or<br />\nmore importantly, a lack of communication between students and<br />\nfaculty. How are \"star\" faculty<br />\nin their fields to be held accountable for their undergraduate advising and teaching responsibilities when it is an effort just<br />\nconvincing them to stay here?<br />\nBut the biggest concern that we<br />\nas students should have is to<br />\nwhere our ability lies to be a<br />\ndirect source of input into the implementation of this plan. Its implications affect students as<br />\nmuch, if not more, than the administrators and faculty who meet<br />\nwith Dean Armstrong of the<br />\nSchool of Arts and Sciences to<br />\nhammer out a working solution<br />\nfor that division's crisis.

You're forgetting that<br />\nLippe was also a co-organizer of<br />\nthe march. He knows what Francis did, and in fact praised him on<br />\nseveral occasions.

Fortsch<br />\n<br />\nRally, 'round II<br />\nTo the Editors:<br />\nThere has been much talk about<br />\nthe five-year financial plan which<br />\nis currently under consideration<br />\nby the administration. The fiveyear plan is a possible solution to<br />\nthe financial difficulties being experienced by the School of Arts<br />\nand Sciences. According to the<br />\nmost recent draft of the five-year<br />\nplan, by the year 1993 the School<br />\nof Arts and Sciences will show a<br />\nchronic deficit. The plan seeks to<br />\navoid this disaster by reformatting many of the departments<br />\nwithin the School of Arts and<br />\nSciences.<br />\nAmong the measures to be implemented is the selection of the<br />\n\"key disciplines\" within the<br />\nSchool of Arts and Sciences and<br />\nthe phasing out of the rest. In addition, the draft calls for cutting<br />\nfaculty by ten percent, while increasing undergraduate enrollment by 230 students. These<br />\nmeasures would obviously lead to<br />\nan increased student to faculty<br />\nratio, which is generally seen as<br />\na lowering of standards. Furthermore, there is a planned increase<br />\nin tuition. While next year's<br />\nfreshmen would feel the brunt of<br />\nthe increase, all classes would be<br />\naffected.<br />\nThe question here is what<br />\nquality of education and at what<br />\nprice. These issues concern all of<br />\n<br />\nus who have decided to obtain our<br />\neducation at Hopkins.

Because it would<br />\nshow that their efforts during National College Drug Awareness<br />\nWeek had paid off. The Week,<br />\nwhich began the Monday before<br />\nlast, comprises a program that occurs each year on college campuses across the country. Its purposes are many, but the basic<br />\nfocus of the event is to prevent<br />\nsubstance abuse of all sorts, with<br />\nemphasis on responsible drinking<br />\nand abstinence from harder<br />\ndrugs. The emphasis was on the<br />\nproblem of alcohol abuse, since,<br />\naccording to Trish Martin,<br />\nChairperson of the Committee on<br />\nSubstance Abuse Prevention, \"it<br />\nis definitely the drug of choice at<br />\nHopkins.\"<br />\nThe Week was coordinated by<br />\nthe Committee, and featured activities for both entertainment and<br />\ninformation. Wednesday night<br />\n<br />\nSpring Fashion has<br />\nsprung upon us<br />\nby Lisa Goldberg<br />\nFor American fashions, the key<br />\nword this spring is easy: no teeny<br />\nminis or floppy florals,just flowing, layered combinations in colors for everyone. Most of the<br />\nclothes featured can probably be<br />\nfound in your closet, since neutral<br />\nclassics are often the star features<br />\nof the new look. The trick is to<br />\ncreate eclectic combinations from<br />\nthe old standbys. Here are some<br />\nof this year's star pieces:<br />\n<br />\nNauticals. Navy, white and red<br />\nare predominant color combinations this season, and so are goldtone accessories. Look for the big<br />\nbrass buttons, coin-shaped earrings and gold chain belts to jazz<br />\nup existing pieces in the wardrobe. Spectator pumps are appearing in all colors, and quilted<br />\nhandbags with chain straps (like<br />\nChanel, but cheaper) can be<br />\nfound in any local department<br />\nstore.<br />\nDots. One coin-dotted white<br />\nand navy blouse will brighten all<br />\nyour clothes from jeans to skirts.<br />\nIf spots intimidate you, try patches<br />\nof the pattern instead, like on a<br />\nscarf or a pair of socks.<br />\n. The bigger, the<br />\nFolk Jewelry.<br />\nbetter, but stick with one<br />\ndefinitive piece\u2014a pair of tiered<br />\n<br />\nsilver earrings with dangles or a<br />\nbig brass cuff.

As ethnic trends<br />\nincrease, so do earth tones. The<br />\none piece that you will find in<br />\nevery magazine and catalog this<br />\nspring is the safari jacket, in a<br />\nrange of fabrics, colors, and prices.<br />\nYou can wear this hip-length<br />\njacket belted or straight with<br />\njeans, leggings, or skirts; in silk<br />\nor in twill. It should pay back its<br />\ninvestment in a month.<br />\nLong skirts. The more flowing<br />\nthis year, the better. Try wearing<br />\none with scrunch-down socks,<br />\nlace-up shoes and a roomy blazer,<br />\nor classicize your look with an<br />\nequally flowing blouse. Rayon<br />\ndrapes particularly well.<br />\nRemember the details, they<br />\ndefine fashion this spring. The<br />\nright jewelry and hair accessories<br />\n(hats are big this spring) are<br />\nessential for polishing off the<br />\nplainer styles. Don't fight the<br />\nflow with bulky shoulder pads or<br />\nan overabundance of pattern: the<br />\nkey to eclecticism is simplicity.<br />\nEasy to plan and easy to wear\u2014<br />\nperhaps fashion has finally<br />\nfigured out what women want.<br />\n<br />\nEly Brown<br />\n<br />\nThe jazz band at High Tea, one of the events held for Drug Awareness Week, provided students with a source<br />\nof good, clean fun.<br />\nlast week, an improvisational<br />\ncomedy group from the University of Maryland, Erasable, Inc.,<br />\nperformed, and the night after<br />\ncomedians from a comedy club<br />\ndowntown were featured. On Friday afternoon, the Committee<br />\nsponsored a High Tea, in the style<br />\nof the British, with tea and cake<br />\nserved, while the Spreading the<br />\nWord Jazztet jammed out hardbop jazz. Throughout the week,<br />\ninformation regarding alcohol,<br />\ndrugs, and their abuse was circulated throughout the campus.<br />\nThe Gazette featured a quiz on the<br />\nsubject, bookmarks were put out<br />\non the bookstore, and stand-up<br />\n\"tents\" were put on the tables in<br />\nthe Terrace Room. This was all<br />\nin an effort to heighten awareness<br />\nof substance abuse and its consequences, and also to provide an<br />\nopportunity for students to get<br />\ntogether at events, and enjoy<br />\nthemselves and the company of<br />\nfriends, without any artificial<br />\nchemical help.<br />\nThe Committee on Substance<br />\nAbuse Prevention is made up of<br />\ntwelve members, among them<br />\nChairperson Trish Martin, a<br />\nrepresentative from each class,<br />\nand an IFC representative. Begun<br />\nin 1987, the program is paid for<br />\nin part by a two-year grant from<br />\nthe Department of Education.<br />\nThe rest is financed by Hopkins.<br />\nThe purposes of the group are<br />\nwidespread, and tackle many<br />\naspects of what is a very elusive<br />\nproblem on college campuses and<br />\nthe nation at large.<br />\n\"Our primary purpose is to<br />\nhelp students realize that they can<br />\nhave a good time without the use<br />\nof alcohol or drugs,\" says Martin. But while much emphasis is<br />\nput on alternatives to these drugs,<br />\nthe Committee has taken a different approach from tradition.<br />\n\"The message is not 'Don't<br />\ndrink,\"'says Jeffrey Morgheim,<br />\nFreshman Class Representative to<br />\nthe Committee. \"It's 'Drink<br />\nresponsibly if you're going to<br />\ndrink at all.' We're not deceiving<br />\nourselves. Drinking is a part of<br />\nour culture, and it has its place.<br />\nWe've lost a lot of people and a<br />\nlot of time with the older approach that just says 'Don't<br />\ndrink.' Often it's a hypocritical<br />\napproach, and we like to think<br />\n<br />\nwe're taking on the problem from groups. \"Hopefully students will<br />\ntake part,\" says Morgheim, \"and<br />\na different route.\"<br />\nThis route also hinges upon say to themselves,'Hey, I'm dorecognition by the drinker when ing something constructive, and<br />\nhe or she has a problem, and it it doesn't involve alcohol.\"<br />\nTargeted particularly for the<br />\nis another function of the Comis the Class of 1992, the<br />\nprogram<br />\nmittee to lay down recognizable<br />\nguidelines for students to watch current freshmen.

The Replacements' new<br />\nLP, Don't Tell a Soul, is just a<br />\nhalf-step away from being an allout, capital \"P\" pop record. And<br />\nwhile that's hardly an insult, it<br />\ncertainly is a surprise to those<br />\nwho've followed their careers<br />\nfrom the start. This, after all, is<br />\nthe band whose previous album,<br />\nPleased to Meet Me, produced by<br />\nMemphis legend Jim Dickinson,<br />\nwas justly hailed as the Exile on<br />\nMain Street of the eighties. Expectations were high for this new<br />\nrecord and many will be<br />\ndisappointed.<br />\nFirst of all, there are only two<br />\nreal rockers worthy of the<br />\nReplacements' tradition and both<br />\nare on the second side. It's clear<br />\n<br />\nthat songwriter Paul Westerberg's priorities are firmly established. He spends most of<br />\nthe first side investigating a variety of mid-tempo pop styles, even<br />\ntrying his hand at a bit of country. In fact, it is only on his more<br />\nunusual songs that Westerberg<br />\ntruly succeeds. The first two<br />\nsongs on side one, \"Talent<br />\nShow\" and \"Back to Back,\" are<br />\nlikable but not remarkable, so it's<br />\nnot until \"We'll Inherit the<br />\nEarth\" that the band hits stride.<br />\nWith its atmospheric production,<br />\nopening with the eerie sound of<br />\na telegraph distress signal, and<br />\nswelling synthesized strings, \"Inherit\" has a cinematic sweep<br />\nunlike anything Westerberg has<br />\never written. The next song,<br />\n\"Achin' To Be,\" describes a<br />\npretty young girl in search of her<br />\n<br />\nSt.PaulCleaners<br />\n3120 St. Paul St.<br />\n235-4413<br />\n<br />\nplace in the world. \"She's kind<br />\nof like a movie/that everyone<br />\nrushes to see,\" he sings, then<br />\nadds, \"And no one understands<br />\nit/sitting in their seats.\" It's that<br />\nkind of wry, unpretentious wit that<br />\nhas elevated the Replacements'<br />\nabove that of their peers.<br />\nWesterberg completes the hat<br />\ntrick with \"They're Blind,\" a<br />\nsweet acoustic number complete<br />\nwith sustained \"ooh aahs\" on the<br />\nbacking vocal tracks. It's the<br />\nperfect vehicle for his rough but<br />\nvulnerable manner of singing.<br />\nJoe Cocker he is not, and yet,<br />\nlike him, Westerberg's voice<br />\ncracks with emotion just at the<br />\nright time and in just the right<br />\nway to make the song a genuine<br />\nheartbreaker.<br />\nSide two doesn't fare as well<br />\nthough it starts with a bang.<br />\n\"Anywhere Is Better Than Here\"<br />\nleans out of the speakers like the<br />\nReplacements of yore.

They range from the approach we are most familiar with<br />\nto a biological father donating the<br />\nsperm, a biological mother<br />\ndonating the egg, a gestational<br />\nmother carrying the child, and a<br />\nset of legal parents to raise the<br />\nchild. The choice of where to stop<br />\nalong this biotechnological path,<br />\nor \"slippery slope,\" as Dr. Edward Wallach called it in his<br />\nWelch lecture, is not a matter of<br />\nmedicine but a matter of ethics.<br />\nDr. Wallach, chairman of the<br />\nDepartment of Gynecology and<br />\nObstetrics at JHMI, gave an introduction to the natural process<br />\nof fertilization and gestation,<br />\nfollowed by explanations of the<br />\namazing array of options<br />\npresented to today's potential<br />\nparents. This multitude of choices<br />\n<br />\nrapidly becomes a multitude of<br />\nlegal and ethical dilemmas.<br />\nEssentially, they are \"Who is the<br />\nmother?\" \"Who is the father?\"<br />\n\"Who picks the parents?\" and<br />\n\"Who should decide which<br />\nsperms, eggs, and embryos will<br />\nlive?\" Dr. Wallach offered no<br />\nanswers. In his practice, he constantly has to reevaluate his<br />\npositions.<br />\nAmong the most newsworthy<br />\nreproductive technologies is surrogate motherhood. Dr. Wallach<br />\ndiscussed two cases illustrating<br />\ntwo ways that one woman can<br />\ncarry a child to be raised by<br />\nanother. Surrogate gestational<br />\nmothers receive a fertilized egg,<br />\nand thus have no genetic connection to the child, except in a South<br />\nAfrican case. A couple donated<br />\nsperm and egg cells which were<br />\ncombined in vitro. The resulting<br />\nembryos were implanted into the<br />\nwoman's mother. A surrogate<br />\nmother is artificially inseminated<br />\n<br />\nwith the biological father's<br />\nsperm, and carries her biological<br />\nchild to term. Surrogate mothers<br />\nare then supposed to turn the<br />\nchild over to its legal parents. Unfortunately, inadequate or nonexistent psychological screening<br />\nof the surrogate led to the Baby<br />\nM case. Surrogate mother Mary<br />\nBeth Whitehead kidnapped the<br />\nchild from her employers, the<br />\nSterns.<br />\nBiologically, fathers are easy to<br />\nget. Sperm banks that freeze<br />\ndonated sperm offer a diseasefree option for couples with impotency problems or fears of<br />\ngenetic disease carried by the<br />\nman. But which is the father in<br />\nthese cases: the biological father<br />\nor the partner of the woman who<br />\ncarried the child?<br />\nWho should be allowed to use<br />\nthese<br />\nreproductive<br />\nnew<br />\ntechnologies is another area of<br />\ndebate. Dr. Wallach believes that<br />\nin the United States, where we<br />\n<br />\nhave the right to \"life, liberty,<br />\nand the pursuit of happiness\" we<br />\nalso have the right to procreate.<br />\nAs of now, we have the right not<br />\nto procreate: contraception, abortion, and voluntary sterilization<br />\nare all legal. Our fertility is protected: no one may be sterilized<br />\nwithout full understanding and<br />\nconsent. Thus it seems logical to<br />\nconclude that everyone has the<br />\nright to procreate.<br />\nThe logic of this argument is<br />\nbalanced against ethical and<br />\nsocial questions. The Catholic<br />\nChurch is opposed to these<br />\ntechnologies because they<br />\nseparate sexual union from procreation. Questions arise about<br />\nthe psychological impact on a<br />\nchild conceived by unorthodox<br />\nprocedures and on the participation in his birth. For instance, a<br />\nchild can be born as a result of a<br />\ndonated egg and sperm fertilized<br />\nin a petri dish, the resulting embryo implanted in a donated<br />\nuterus, then transferred into a<br />\ngestational mother to become her<br />\nchild. \"That's four parties,\" joked Dr. Wallach, \"not counting<br />\nwater, form a stool, and increase (ORT) for diarrhea saves lives the physician!\"<br />\nabsorption of nutrients by slow- but does not restore weight or<br />\nDoctors who perform these<br />\ning the transit of food through the strength. \"People have depend- procedures must<br />\nalso determine<br />\ngastrointestinal system.<br />\ned too much on ORT alone,\" who will be allowed to use them.<br />\nChildren with severe, chronic says Saavedra.<br />\nAt Hopkins, only married couples<br />\ndiarrhea are in danger of starving<br />\nThe use of fiber to control diar- are accepted into the in vitro ferto death, says Jose Saavedra, rhea is not really new.

What<br />\nshould happen to embryos not implanted in a mother? Can they be<br />\ndiscarded? Can they be used for<br />\nresearch? Currently, the answer<br />\nto both questions is no.

Thus<br />\nparents can learn if their embryo<br />\nwill develop into a child with a<br />\ngenetic defect.<br />\nThis article, like Dr. Wallach's<br />\nlectures, leaves many question<br />\nmarks. At JHMI these questions<br />\nare considered daily. Reproductive technology at Hopkins is very<br />\nconservative. In vitro fertilization<br />\nis done routinely. Artificial insemination with donor sperm has<br />\nbeen considered, and Dr.<br />\nWallach envisions Hopkins as a<br />\nsperm and embryo bank when<br />\nresources become available.

The<br />\n67-61 non-conference loss leaves<br />\n<br />\nthe Blue Jays 11-10 on the season<br />\nwith just one game remaining.<br />\nHopkins consistently left the<br />\nback door wide open early in the<br />\nfirst half, and Shepherd's Cammilla Clark (14 points) and Tracy<br />\nHodges (18 points) took full advantage of the defensive<br />\nbreakdown. The Blue Jays final-<br />\n<br />\nBill Berger<br />\n<br />\nKerni McTiernan sizes up the Shepherd defense<br />\n<br />\nly received help from 6'3\"<br />\nfreshman Julie Sly (8 points, 11<br />\nrebounds) and 5'11\" sophomore<br />\nco-captain Kristie Kantowski (12<br />\npoints, 7 rebounds) underneath,<br />\nand the hole was blocked up. A<br />\nthree-point play from sophomore<br />\nco-captain Julianne Rolapp (15<br />\npoints, 3 steals) put the Jays<br />\nahead by one with two minutes to<br />\nplay in the half, but the Hopkins<br />\nlead quickly disappeared. A Kantowski basket with seconds to go<br />\nended the half with Shepherd<br />\nleading 37-34.<br />\nSophomore guard Tracy<br />\nHourigan put a quick four points<br />\non the scoreboard for the Jays in<br />\nthe second half, but lack of communication plagued Hopkins and<br />\nShepherd's lead gradually increased. Rolapp turned on the<br />\nheat later on in the half along with<br />\nthe freshmen Kerni McTiernan (6<br />\npoints, 3 steals) and Tracy Jo<br />\nWilliams (8 points, 4 steals, 4<br />\nassists), but her efforts couldn't<br />\ncarry the team to victory. According to Coach Nancy Blank,<br />\n\"Julianne played the total game,<br />\nboth offensively and defensively.<br />\nShe is consistant and has a lot of<br />\nhustle.\"<br />\nA disappointing last three<br />\nminutes found the normally col-<br />\n<br />\nlected Jays out of their game plan.<br />\nCoach Blank was disappointed in<br />\nthe final minutes of play. \"We<br />\nhad lots of opportunities to be in<br />\nit. We lost in the last three<br />\nminutes.\" Hopkins shot just 37<br />\npercent while Shepherd made<br />\nover half of their shots from the<br />\nfield. Rolapp, the team's high<br />\nscorer Wednesday night, stated,<br />\n\"We've been starting to come<br />\ntogether as a team.

Kern<br />\nMcTiernan (13 points) went 5 for<br />\n5, pulled down 11 rebounds, and<br />\nadded 7 assists and 5 steals to her<br />\n<br />\nimpressive totals. Julianne<br />\nRolapp contributed 14 points and<br />\n5 assists to the effort, while Kantowski and Kelly Van Houten<br />\nadded 11 and 10 points,<br />\nrespectively.<br />\nHopkins went five minutes<br />\nwithout a point in the second half,<br />\nfalling from a one-point to a<br />\ntwelve-point deficit as they lost to<br />\nWashington University 67-57 on<br />\nFriday night. The Blue Jays shot<br />\na low 36.7 percent from the field<br />\nto Washington's 65.2 percent.<br />\nMcTiernan went 6 for 6 from the<br />\nfree-throw line, and accounted<br />\nfor 7 rebounds and 4 steals in the<br />\nlosing effort.

The City Interstate<br />\nDepartment had also been<br />\ninvolved.<br />\nWilliams said the process of<br />\nchange began after problems with<br />\nthe road were brought to public<br />\nattentio..1 by the News-Letter,<br />\nwhich focused on the high in-<br /><br />\ncidence of pedestrian accidents in<br />\nthe center portions of Charles<br />\nStreet.<br />\nHe mentioned that, at the time,<br />\nhe played a major role in placing<br />\nmany of the signs and markings<br />\nto notify persons about the<br />\nunusual pattern of traffic flow.<br />\nOne possibility the Commission discussed was to make double southbound lanes by removing the divider and completely<br />\nseparating the north and southbound traffic. Unfortunately, the<br />\nBureau of Highways and the<br />\nHomewood community were<br />\nboth opposed to the idea because<br />\nit would have to radically alter the<br />\nhistorical configuration of<br />\nCharles Street and could be quite<br />\nexpensive to implement.<br />\nAccording to Williams, exhaustive studies were done to<br />\nmeasure the capacity of Charles<br />\nStreet southbound and to consider<br />\nthe importance of destinations<br />\nalong that way. Officials then<br />\ndecided, given the traffic volume,<br />\nto close the second southbound<br />\nlane for all but four hours of the<br />\nday, assuming a certain percentage of drivers would adjust their<br />\nhabits.<br />\nThe University received<br />\nrecommendations at that time to<br />\nput in an enormous number of<br />\nwarning signs, directed more at<br />\npedestrians than at motor traffic,<br />\nhighlighting the legitimate<br />\ncrosswalks.

She was \"apparently despondent\" at the time<br />\nof her death, he said.<br /><br />\nposed far fewer problems after<br />\nthe traffic redistribution. Considering recent accidents in the<br />\nlane, he could only suggest that<br />\n\"no matter what is done to a<br />\nstreet, people have to use common sense and pay attention to the<br />\nsigns.\"<br />\nHe said that because new<br />\ngroups of students are unfamiliar<br />\nwith the lane's history, Hopkins<br />\nmust take responsibility to provide necessary information about<br />\nCharles Street.<br />\nWhile the city could make the<br />\nlane into a fourth northbound lane<br />\nor close it down altogether, both<br />\nthese solutions would be difficult<br />\nfor drivers of all sorts, said<br />\nWilliams.<br />\nTherefore, Williams said he<br />\ncould only exhort persons to \"try<br />\nand be less careless, and look<br />\nboth ways when crossing.<br />\nEnough indicators have been provided to give pedestrians an<br />\nawareness of the direction and<br />\nBent Goro<br />\nfunction of the second south- An average of two people are hit every year in the center southbound<br />\nlane on Charles Street because cars don't observe street signs.<br />\nbound lane.\"<br /><br />\nSpeaker purports Dukakis talk,<br />\ninstead praises Jackson plans<br />\nby Michael McCully<br />\nThe audience at the Glass Pavilion heard of a new<br />\npolitical wave sweeping the nation.

Though the lecture was titled \"Why<br />\nDukakis Lost the Election,\" Navarro touched on<br />\nthis subject only briefly in his talk.<br />\nHe spent the bulk of his lecture endorsing what<br />\nhe called \"the most progressive Democratic platform since the New Deal of the Thirties, \"crediting<br />\nJackson's campaign as the impetus behind what he<br />\nsaw as the Democratic Party's move to the left.<br /><br />\nNavarro faulted Dukakis and Bentsen's movement<br />\naway from Jackson's policies and the platform put<br />\nforth by the Democrats in Atlanta as reasons for the<br />\nticket's sharp decline in the polls last fall and its<br />\neventual defeat. Navarro contended that only when<br />\nDukakis \"rediscovered his populist roots\" did he<br />\nregain some momentum in the campaign. But, alas,<br />\nthat discovery came too late.<br />\nAccording to Navarro, Dukakis's apparent move<br />\nto the political right cost him the election. Navarro<br />\nprovided statistics and polls to support his contention that the majority of Americans support an expansion of government support of social programs.<br />\nIf this working class group could be mobilized into<br />\na voting coalition, he said, then its role in the next<br />\nPresidential election would indeed be powerful.<br />\nNavarro advised the Democratic Party to follow<br />\nJackson's lead and target the blue-collar vote with<br />\nconsistent populist rhetoric.<br />\nThe question-and-answer period following the<br />\nlecture was for all intents and purposes a Jesse<br />\nJackson rally. One audience member would stand<br />\nup and praise Jackson. Others would then voice their<br />\nagreement. Before the lecture broke up, Navarro<br />\nleft a parting message: Jackson, he said, is the future<br />\nof the Democratic Party, and if the Democrats wish<br />\nto recapture the White House, they should follow<br />\nhis lead to the left.<br /><br />\nNEWS BRIEF<br />\nFive-Year Plan forces University to 'reluctantly' shut Chesapeake Bay Institute by 1991<br />\nCourtesy of News and<br />\nInformation<br />\nHopkins has decided to<br />\nphase out and close by<br />\nDecember 31, 1991 the<br />\nChesapeake Bay institute, an<br />\nestuarine and oceanographic<br />\nresearch facility whose staff<br />\nis located in Shady Side,<br />\nMaryland, and at the<br />\nHomewood campus in<br />\nBaltimore.<br />\nUniversity officials said they<br />\narrived at the decision reluctantly after determining that it<br />\nwould be too costly to, main-<br /><br />\ntain the institute as a first-rank<br />\nresearch enterprise. Given<br />\nthe fact, CBI Director James<br />\nD. Ebert said he concurred in<br />\nthe decision to close the<br />\ninstitute.<br />\nFive-Year Plan<br />\nThe<br />\nprepared late last year by the<br />\nHopkins administration calls<br />\nfor the University's subsidy to<br />\nDBI to diminish from<br />\n$550,000 this year to zero in<br />\n1993. CBI's researchers raise<br />\na substantial sum of money in<br />\nsponsored research, amounting this year to $1.9 million<br />\nin research contracts and an<br /><br />\nadditional $400,000 in indirect<br />\ncost recoveries. However, that<br />\nsupports only about eighty<br />\npercent of the institute's $2.8<br />\nmillion budget.<br />\nThe decision will affect fifteen researchers and twentyfive senior and support staff<br />\npersonnel. University officials<br />\nsaid they expect the nearly<br />\nthree years of lead time to<br />\nenable all of the researchers to<br />\nfind positions elsewhere. They<br />\nsaid staff members will be encouraged to apply for other<br />\npositions<br />\nwithin<br />\nthe<br />\nUniversity.<br /><br />\nNo decisions have been<br />\nmade about the disposition of<br />\nCBI's physical plant at Shady<br />\nSide.

Due to scheduling<br />\nconflicts, as reported last week,<br />\ntonight's Hoppy Hour will be one of only five.<br />\nNot only does the overburdened Glass<br />\nPavilion underscore a need for more<br />\ngathering places on campus, but it interrupts what has become a Friday afternoon tradition\u2014to enjoy a relaxed atmosphere in which different sectors of<br />\nthe Hopkins community, that is, faculty, graduate students, administration,<br />\nand undergraduates can interrelate. This<br />\nmingling process, difficult to achieve<br />\nunder any circumstances, has been<br />\nfacilitated in the past by Hoppy Hour's<br />\nreliability and continuity. The \"coincidences\" that led to the lack of booking for the Glass Pavilion are indeed<br />\nunhappy ones.<br />\nBut scheduling difficulties are, in a<br />\nreal sense, the least of the problems facing Hoppy Hour this semester. The<br />\nHour was a direct response to (lest we<br />\nbe blinded by Five-Year Plan<br />\nbrouhahas) a major finding of the<br />\nHuman Climate Task Force Report.<br />\nThe report citea \"artificial barriers\"<br />\nwhich both faculty/administration and<br />\nstudents felt existed among them. Hoppy Hour was to be the neutral turf, ,<br />\nwhere non-academic and non-bureaucratic introductions could be made, and<br />\nthe firct blows to the \"barriers\" could<br /><br />\nbe struck.<br />\nHowever, after a promising first-year<br />\nattendance of a broad cross-section of<br />\nthe community, this year it has been difficult to encourage faculty and administration to participate. Despite<br />\ntireless efforts to draw them in, such as<br />\nweekly reminders and invitations to cosponsor specific Fridays, faculty and administration were not lured to the Glass<br />\nPavilion on these afternoons. Most<br />\nfrustratingly, when the HOP chose to<br />\nrecognize different academic departments, often the very professors whose<br />\nturn it was to be recognized failed to appear; key administrative officials (you<br />\nknow who you are) have been no-shows<br />\nas well. Student attendance, however,<br />\nhas been booming, regardless of departmental liaisons.<br />\nThe fundamental irony underlying<br />\nthis crisis is that we have in Hoppy Hour<br />\na relatively inexpensive means of correcting a serious problem at Homewood\u2014<br />\nclimate. As such, Hoppy Hour should<br />\nbe particularly attractive to the Hopkins<br />\nadministrators accustomed to crying<br />\n\"deficit\" and dismissing more costly<br />\nproposals. In this instance, all that is required to ameliorate the lack of communication is participation. And if this<br />\ncondition is not fulfilled, all of the<br />\nwords of support pledged in the past to<br />\nan improved climate amount to nothing<br />\nmore than perfunctory lip service paid<br />\nto revenue-raising undergraduates.<br /><br />\nthat one would expect in return?<br />\nWith a reduction in faculty expenditures and a sizeable increase<br />\nin undergraduate enrollment over<br />\nfive years, what effect will there<br />\nbe on the number of faculty<br />\navailable for teaching'? This goes<br />\nhand in hand with our program of<br />\nfaculty advising and its inability<br />\nfor the most part to be an effective resource for students to use,<br />\ndue to either poor structuring or<br />\nmore importantly, a lack of communication between students and<br />\nfaculty. How are \"star\" faculty<br />\nin their fields to be held accountable for their undergraduate advising and teaching responsibilities when it is an effort just<br />\nconvincing them to stay here?<br />\nBut the biggest concern that we<br />\nas students should have is to<br />\nwhere our ability lies to be a<br />\ndirect source of input into the implementation of this plan. Its implications affect students as<br />\nmuch, if not more, than the administrators and faculty who meet<br />\nwith Dean Armstrong of the<br />\nSchool of Arts and Sciences to<br />\nhammer out a working solution<br />\nfor that division's crisis. We as<br />\nstudents should push for the<br />\nestablishment of an advisory<br />\ncommittee of students, faculty,<br /><br />\nIn these dark days of<br />\nFebruary and impending graduation, who isn't drawn back into<br />\nthe sweeter memories of<br />\nchildhood, lacking (as most of<br />\nours did) book bills, rent checks,<br />\nand rainy nine o'clock classes?

From the time the plan<br />\nwas released, in late December<br />\nwhen most of us were on our way<br />\nhome after finals, to the present<br />\nthere has been no line of student<br />\ninput by which we could have our<br />\nconcerns on the plan addressed<br />\nand potentially affect some kind<br />\nof change. As president of the<br />\nStudent Council I have discussed<br />\nthe issues at hand with various administrators, faculty, and<br />\nstudents, both undergraduate and<br />\ngraduate, and would like to present some of the concerns which<br />\nappear to be most pressing to us<br />\nas students at this university. I'm<br />\nsure there are others, but these<br />\nshould serve as a starting point.<br />\nFirst, why are we as students<br />\nat Hopkins being asked to foot the<br />\nbill for the increased costs of<br />\nresearch which have outgrown<br />\ntheir means of funding? This is a<br />\nproblem at all \"major research<br />\ninstitutions.\" But here while we<br />\nas students make concessions<br />\nwith increased tuition and larger<br />\nclass sizes, where is the overall<br />\ncommitment to bettering education and classroom instruction<br /><br />\npseudoperspicacity<br />\njonathan engler<br /><br />\nand administrators in the implementation of the Five-Year<br />\nPlan to ensure our interests are<br />\nmade known. Only with the<br />\nworking input of we the students<br />\ncan a plan of this scope be<br />\nrealized.<br />\nThe Trustees of this University meet February 22 to approve<br />\nthe Five-Year Plan. I urge<br />\neveryone concerned with the<br />\nfuture of education at Johns<br />\nHopkins to keep informed on the<br />\nissues at hand, and I would hope<br />\nto see as many of you as possible<br />\nat a rally to discuss your opinions<br />\nof the Five-Year Plan and its implications on Tuesday, February<br />\n21 at 5 p.m. in the Garrett Room<br />\nof the MSE Library. We will be<br />\npetitioning for an advisory committee with student membership<br />\nin hopes of presenting it to the<br />\nTrustees for their meeting the<br />\nfollowing day.

First he calls C.R.

Some organizations on campus helped us out,<br />\nothers didn't, but the support I<br />\nreceived from Francis was<br />\nnothing short of phenomenal. He<br />\nselflessly contributed funds right<br />\nout of the C.R. budget, and<br />\nsingle-handedly got several<br />\nstudents to march who wouldn't<br />\nhave given it a second thought<br />\notherwise. By the way, Mr.<br />\nMaskit, if you thought that marching was supporting an AntiSoviet cause, then you've succeeded in missing the whole point<br />\nof the rally. No Anti-semite<br />\nwould have supported it.<br />\nThirdly, I know what the words<br />\n\"never again\" mean. They are<br />\nvery powerful words that<br />\nshouldn't be wasted crying wolf.<br />\nTell me, who's going to listen to<br />\nyou now when a real Anti-Semite<br />\npops up?<br />\nFinally, Mr. Maskit, in your<br />\noriginal letter you lament the fact<br /><br />\nabout the future of the University and the course it should take.<br />\nA petition will be passed around<br />\nfor the formation of a committee<br />\ncomposed of students, faculty and<br />\nadministrators to oversee the<br />\nplan, and other proposals will be<br />\ndiscussed. Refreshments will not<br />\nbe served.<br /><br />\nthat Scott David Lippe is no<br />\nlonger here to take care of Francis. Ha! You're forgetting that<br />\nLippe was also a co-organizer of<br />\nthe march. He knows what Francis did, and in fact praised him on<br />\nseveral occasions. So Mr.<br />\nMaskit, perhaps it's time that you<br />\ncheck your facts and then be<br />\nsilent.

Fortsch<br /><br />\nRally, 'round II<br />\nTo the Editors:<br />\nThere has been much talk about<br />\nthe five-year financial plan which<br />\nis currently under consideration<br />\nby the administration. The fiveyear plan is a possible solution to<br />\nthe financial difficulties being experienced by the School of Arts<br />\nand Sciences. According to the<br />\nmost recent draft of the five-year<br />\nplan, by the year 1993 the School<br />\nof Arts and Sciences will show a<br />\nchronic deficit. The plan seeks to<br />\navoid this disaster by reformatting many of the departments<br />\nwithin the School of Arts and<br />\nSciences.<br />\nAmong the measures to be implemented is the selection of the<br />\n\"key disciplines\" within the<br />\nSchool of Arts and Sciences and<br />\nthe phasing out of the rest. In addition, the draft calls for cutting<br />\nfaculty by ten percent, while increasing undergraduate enrollment by 230 students. These<br />\nmeasures would obviously lead to<br />\nan increased student to faculty<br />\nratio, which is generally seen as<br />\na lowering of standards. Furthermore, there is a planned increase<br />\nin tuition. While next year's<br />\nfreshmen would feel the brunt of<br />\nthe increase, all classes would be<br />\naffected.<br />\nThe question here is what<br />\nquality of education and at what<br />\nprice. These issues concern all of<br /><br />\nus who have decided to obtain our<br />\neducation at Hopkins. As such<br />\nthere will be a question and<br />\nanswer session on the Five-Year<br />\nPlan on Tuesday, Febuary 21 at<br />\n5:00 p.m. in the Garrett Room of<br />\nthe MSE Library.

The Week,<br />\nwhich began the Monday before<br />\nlast, comprises a program that occurs each year on college campuses across the country. Its purposes are many, but the basic<br />\nfocus of the event is to prevent<br />\nsubstance abuse of all sorts, with<br />\nemphasis on responsible drinking<br />\nand abstinence from harder<br />\ndrugs. The emphasis was on the<br />\nproblem of alcohol abuse, since,<br />\naccording to Trish Martin,<br />\nChairperson of the Committee on<br />\nSubstance Abuse Prevention, \"it<br />\nis definitely the drug of choice at<br />\nHopkins.\"<br />\nThe Week was coordinated by<br />\nthe Committee, and featured activities for both entertainment and<br />\ninformation.

Most of the<br />\nclothes featured can probably be<br />\nfound in your closet, since neutral<br />\nclassics are often the star features<br />\nof the new look. The trick is to<br />\ncreate eclectic combinations from<br />\nthe old standbys. Here are some<br />\nof this year's star pieces:<br /><br />\nNauticals. Navy, white and red<br />\nare predominant color combinations this season, and so are goldtone accessories. Look for the big<br />\nbrass buttons, coin-shaped earrings and gold chain belts to jazz<br />\nup existing pieces in the wardrobe. Spectator pumps are appearing in all colors, and quilted<br />\nhandbags with chain straps (like<br />\nChanel, but cheaper) can be<br />\nfound in any local department<br />\nstore.<br />\nDots. One coin-dotted white<br />\nand navy blouse will brighten all<br />\nyour clothes from jeans to skirts.<br />\nIf spots intimidate you, try patches<br />\nof the pattern instead, like on a<br />\nscarf or a pair of socks.<br />\n.

This was all<br />\nin an effort to heighten awareness<br />\nof substance abuse and its consequences, and also to provide an<br />\nopportunity for students to get<br />\ntogether at events, and enjoy<br />\nthemselves and the company of<br />\nfriends, without any artificial<br />\nchemical help.<br />\nThe Committee on Substance<br />\nAbuse Prevention is made up of<br />\ntwelve members, among them<br />\nChairperson Trish Martin, a<br />\nrepresentative from each class,<br />\nand an IFC representative.

But while much emphasis is<br />\nput on alternatives to these drugs,<br />\nthe Committee has taken a different approach from tradition.<br />\n\"The message is not 'Don't<br />\ndrink,\"'says Jeffrey Morgheim,<br />\nFreshman Class Representative to<br />\nthe Committee. \"It's 'Drink<br />\nresponsibly if you're going to<br />\ndrink at all.' We're not deceiving<br />\nourselves.

This, after all, is<br />\nthe band whose previous album,<br />\nPleased to Meet Me, produced by<br />\nMemphis legend Jim Dickinson,<br />\nwas justly hailed as the Exile on<br />\nMain Street of the eighties.

In fact, it is only on his more<br />\nunusual songs that Westerberg<br />\ntruly succeeds. The first two<br />\nsongs on side one, \"Talent<br />\nShow\" and \"Back to Back,\" are<br />\nlikable but not remarkable, so it's<br />\nnot until \"We'll Inherit the<br />\nEarth\" that the band hits stride.<br />\nWith its atmospheric production,<br />\nopening with the eerie sound of<br />\na telegraph distress signal, and<br />\nswelling synthesized strings, \"Inherit\" has a cinematic sweep<br />\nunlike anything Westerberg has<br />\never written.

(Check the crazed<br />\nmother on the Harley towards the<br />\nend, or the accidentally burning<br />\nbed which Pepa casually douses<br />\nwith a garden hose). Film literati<br />\nwill immediately be reminded of<br />\nGodard and Bunuel, but<br />\nAlmodovar proves himself an<br />\nover-the-top original. He never<br />\nloosens his tight, precise reign; he<br />\nkeeps us jumping and guessing,<br />\nformulating not just a logic but<br />\na wry language and manifesto<br />\nabout male vicissitudes and<br />\nfemale histrionics.<br />\nWhat impresses most about<br />\nWomen is Almodovar's use of the<br />\nhysterical (both visual and literal)<br />\nto convey absolute normality.<br />\nMen and women are stylized to<br />\nan extreme, one functioning as a<br />\ncallous to the other's constant<br />\nrubbing for devotion and affection, one the compliment and<br />\npraise for the other's tight dress<br />\nand sexy strides.

They range from the approach we are most familiar with<br />\nto a biological father donating the<br />\nsperm, a biological mother<br />\ndonating the egg, a gestational<br />\nmother carrying the child, and a<br />\nset of legal parents to raise the<br />\nchild. The choice of where to stop<br />\nalong this biotechnological path,<br />\nor \"slippery slope,\" as Dr. Edward Wallach called it in his<br />\nWelch lecture, is not a matter of<br />\nmedicine but a matter of ethics.<br />\nDr. Wallach, chairman of the<br />\nDepartment of Gynecology and<br />\nObstetrics at JHMI, gave an introduction to the natural process<br />\nof fertilization and gestation,<br />\nfollowed by explanations of the<br />\namazing array of options<br />\npresented to today's potential<br />\nparents. This multitude of choices<br /><br />\nrapidly becomes a multitude of<br />\nlegal and ethical dilemmas.<br />\nEssentially, they are \"Who is the<br />\nmother?\" \"Who is the father?\"<br />\n\"Who picks the parents?\" and<br />\n\"Who should decide which<br />\nsperms, eggs, and embryos will<br />\nlive?\" Dr. Wallach offered no<br />\nanswers. In his practice, he constantly has to reevaluate his<br />\npositions.<br />\nAmong the most newsworthy<br />\nreproductive technologies is surrogate motherhood. Dr. Wallach<br />\ndiscussed two cases illustrating<br />\ntwo ways that one woman can<br />\ncarry a child to be raised by<br />\nanother. Surrogate gestational<br />\nmothers receive a fertilized egg,<br />\nand thus have no genetic connection to the child, except in a South<br />\nAfrican case. A couple donated<br />\nsperm and egg cells which were<br />\ncombined in vitro. The resulting<br />\nembryos were implanted into the<br />\nwoman's mother. A surrogate<br />\nmother is artificially inseminated<br /><br />\nwith the biological father's<br />\nsperm, and carries her biological<br />\nchild to term. Surrogate mothers<br />\nare then supposed to turn the<br />\nchild over to its legal parents. Unfortunately, inadequate or nonexistent psychological screening<br />\nof the surrogate led to the Baby<br />\nM case. Surrogate mother Mary<br />\nBeth Whitehead kidnapped the<br />\nchild from her employers, the<br />\nSterns.<br />\nBiologically, fathers are easy to<br />\nget. Sperm banks that freeze<br />\ndonated sperm offer a diseasefree option for couples with impotency problems or fears of<br />\ngenetic disease carried by the<br />\nman. But which is the father in<br />\nthese cases: the biological father<br />\nor the partner of the woman who<br />\ncarried the child?<br />\nWho should be allowed to use<br />\nthese<br />\nreproductive<br />\nnew<br />\ntechnologies is another area of<br />\ndebate. Dr. Wallach believes that<br />\nin the United States, where we<br /><br />\nhave the right to \"life, liberty,<br />\nand the pursuit of happiness\" we<br />\nalso have the right to procreate.<br />\nAs of now, we have the right not<br />\nto procreate: contraception, abortion, and voluntary sterilization<br />\nare all legal. Our fertility is protected: no one may be sterilized<br />\nwithout full understanding and<br />\nconsent. Thus it seems logical to<br />\nconclude that everyone has the<br />\nright to procreate.<br />\nThe logic of this argument is<br />\nbalanced against ethical and<br />\nsocial questions. The Catholic<br />\nChurch is opposed to these<br />\ntechnologies because they<br />\nseparate sexual union from procreation. Questions arise about<br />\nthe psychological impact on a<br />\nchild conceived by unorthodox<br />\nprocedures and on the participation in his birth. For instance, a<br />\nchild can be born as a result of a<br />\ndonated egg and sperm fertilized<br />\nin a petri dish, the resulting embryo implanted in a donated<br />\nuterus, then transferred into a<br />\ngestational mother to become her<br />\nchild. \"That's four parties,\" joked Dr. Wallach, \"not counting<br />\nwater, form a stool, and increase (ORT) for diarrhea saves lives the physician!\"<br />\nabsorption of nutrients by slow- but does not restore weight or<br />\nDoctors who perform these<br />\ning the transit of food through the strength. \"People have depend- procedures must<br />\nalso determine<br />\ngastrointestinal system.<br />\ned too much on ORT alone,\" who will be allowed to use them.<br />\nChildren with severe, chronic says Saavedra.<br />\nAt Hopkins, only married couples<br />\ndiarrhea are in danger of starving<br />\nThe use of fiber to control diar- are accepted into the in vitro ferto death, says Jose Saavedra, rhea is not really new.
