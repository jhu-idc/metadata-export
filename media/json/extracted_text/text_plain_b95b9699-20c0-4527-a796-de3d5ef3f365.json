What the document as printed<br />\nin yesterday's Gazette does not point out, however, is the fact<br />\nthat Hopkins and Goucher are very different, even on<br />\nsubsequent blushes.<br />\nHopkins, with a world-wide reputation as a university<br />\ndedicated to teaching, research and scholarship on a very high<br />\nlevel is simply a vastly different institution from Goucher,<br />\nknown in some quarters as a finishing school, a country club, or<br />\na home for unmarried maidens. While these descriptions are not<br />\nnecessarily either accurate or perceptive, they are far more<br />\nforthright than is the report, at least in certain areas, such as<br />\nthe state of Goucher's finances and the academic ability of its<br />\nstudents.<br />\nFirst, the draft version of the report, obtained by the<br />\nNews-Letter, labeled \"Final Report,\" and dated July 24, notes<br />\nthat the committee heard an unrecorded oral report on the state<br />\nof Goucher's finances. Since reports are widespread that<br />\nGoucher is in precarious financial condition, the Hopkins<br />\ncommunity should be informed as to the true situation before it<br />\nis asked to consider any plans whatsoever involving Goucher.<br />\nFurthermore, Hopkins has just come off five straight years of<br />\ndeficit budgets and is in no position to take on a poor relation.<br />\nThe Gazette's version of the report was also less than candid<br />\nin its failure to mention \u2014as the July 24 version mentions\u2014that<br />\nthe average SAT-Math score of a Goucher freshman is nearly<br />\n120 points below that of a Hopkins freshman and that the<br />\nVerbal score of the Goucher freshmen averages 62.4 points<br />\nbelow the figure for Hopkins freshmen. The final report also<br />\nfailed to point out that Goucher accepts nearly 80 percent of its<br />\napplicants while Hopkins accepts just over half.<br />\nGiven the financial situation and the academic standards of<br />\nthe women's school up the road, it is certainly unlikely that a<br />\nGoucher division of the Johns Hopkins University would ever<br />\nbecome more than a tolerated younger sibling, loved despite its<br />\nfaults. Even if this judgement should one day prove to have<br />\nbeen pessimistic, it is certainly wrong to expect the Hopkins<br />\ncommunity to make an intelligent decision on its future<br />\nrelationship to Goucher on the basis of the incomplete and<br />\nsomewhat misleading information thus far officially made<br />\navailable.<br />\n<br />\nlet them ring<br />\n\u2022 Student Council President Andrew W. Savitz's decision to<br />\ndrop the discipline issue \"like a hot potato\" this year can only<br />\nas. an SC. afftatioti o\u00a3,the ti.*t of students bete to be<br />\nprocedures.<br />\n<br />\ny e ectvely<br />\n<br />\niJing 1/<br />\n1<br />\n24; iff-conceived discipline<br />\n<br />\nCode, the Student Council has taken the first step towards a<br />\n<br />\ncomplete re-thinking of some problems here.<br />\nWe should now like to propose that three regulations here<br />\nbe changed or dropped, and that some phones be repaired:<br />\n1. Part-time study for undergraduates: Following a<br />\nrecommendation by the Committee on Undergraduate Studies,<br />\nchaired by Dean of Academic Programs Dr. Sigmund Suskind,<br />\nthe Academic Council last spring promulgated regulation<br />\nproscribing part-time study by students in their final two years<br />\nof undergraduate residency here. While we recognize, the<br />\nfinancial expediencies to be realized by such a proscription, we<br />\nfeel that students are unduly restricted in their ability to plan<br />\nmeaningful and flexible curricula. This proscription should join<br />\nthe two-cent postcard and dinosaurs.<br />\n2. Non-resident fee for graduate students: Grad students who<br />\ndesire to take a leave of absence are currently being milked by<br />\nthe University for the privilege of being somewhere else. This is<br />\nsimply absurd.<br />\nIn addition, the University catalog states that students on<br />\nleave are not to be \"physically present on the Homewood<br />\ncampus.\" \"Physically.\" We don't know exactly what they have<br />\nin mind, but we think it's pretty heavy.<br />\n3. Faculty night at the gymnasium: Students are prohibited<br />\nfrom being in the Newton H. White, Jr. Athletic Center on<br />\nThursday evenings. At this time, faculty are allowed to play<br />\nSquash and basketball, and to swim, without having noxious<br />\nHoppies underfoot. Commendable as this may be, few faculty<br />\nmembers in fact take advantage of the special hours, and those<br />\nwho do frequent the gym often_ enough not to merit this<br />\noutrageous favoritism.<br />\n4: Toward the end of the summer, the telephone bells were<br />\ndisconnected from University phones in Wolman Hall. We find<br />\nthis peculiar. Telephones, we feel, ought not to be castrated,<br />\nespecially when one of their primary functions is thus<br />\neliminated.<br />\n<br />\nu1111111.Commigasel,<br />\n<br />\nphotographs by jeff posner<br />\n<br />\nThe BLOCK: Baltimore's Show of Shows<br />\nBy B.H. COHEN<br />\n$25 you can buy a bottle of<br />\ncheap champagne and retreat to a<br />\ncurtained-in booth at the back of a<br />\nroom to have \"some fun.\" Or, if<br />\nyou just want to pass the time, you<br />\ncan buy two drinks, one for<br />\nyourself, and one for your<br />\nnew-found friend, for $2.75<br />\napiece, plus tip.<br />\nFor the most part, The Block is<br />\nsafe. The businessmen there are<br />\nnormally content to conduct their<br />\nrip-offs without serious incident,<br />\nmaximizing ,profit and alienating<br />\nfew. One frequenter said, \"This is<br />\none of the safest blocks in the<br />\ncity.\"<br />\n\"Unless you have business to<br />\ntransact there,\" he added.<br />\nThis is The Block, the<br />\nonce-ornate arcade of burlesque,<br />\ndrink, and American fantasy<br />\nculture.<br />\nBuilt up largely at the turn of<br />\nthe century, The Block thrived<br />\nduring the thirties, when Gypsy<br />\nRose Lee and a host of lesser<br />\nluminaries would offer an evening<br />\nof good clean catcalling fun. The<br />\nBlock hit the skids following World<br />\nWas 1,1 Tockw,even the fl. ouses<br />\nremanis, w<br />\ncan get a<br />\nroom for less than two dollars a<br />\nFor<br />\n<br />\nnight.<br />\n<br />\nNow, while local politicians<br />\nhaggle over the Inner Harbor<br />\nrenewal scheme, The Block lives<br />\non, almost somnambulates, waiting<br />\nonly for its inevitable encounter<br />\nwith the wrecker's ball.<br />\nSprawling around the 500 block<br />\nEast Baltimore Street, The Block<br />\noffers some small intimation of its<br />\nformer glory. At the Two O'Clock<br />\nClub, for instance, Blaze Starr, a<br />\nforty-ish stripper with a legendary<br />\nset of Cooer's ligaments, etc., will<br />\ndo her a bump-and-grind for an<br />\naudience of middle-class folks out<br />\nfor an evening of taking in the<br />\nsights, and for young men whose<br />\ncuriosities have been piqued.<br />\nThe rest of The Block is<br />\nsubstantially less suitable for<br />\nfamily diversion. The Block,<br />\naccording to a Baltimore City<br />\ngrand jury report released early<br />\nthis year, is the host for a myriad<br />\nof illegal acitivities, beyond mere<br />\nprostitution. The Grand Jury<br />\nindicated that:<br />\n\"1. Highly organized criminal<br />\ninterests appear to have a great<br />\namount of control on activities in<br />\nThe Block. They are engaged in<br />\ngambling, narcotics traffic, murder<br />\nfor hire, prostitution, and other<br />\nharmful acts against society.<br />\n\"2. Control of these activities<br />\nappears to be headquartered in<br />\nPhiladelphia. Local names on<br />\nBlock liquor licenses appear to be a<br />\nsham.\"<br />\nLong tolerated by those<br />\n<br />\nresponsible for the enlightenment<br />\nof Baltimorean mores, as somehow<br />\n\"necessary,\" or \"expedient,\" The<br />\nBlock has shown its Southern<br />\nhospitality in another way: Floyd<br />\nJ. Majette, Jr., the black former<br />\nowner of the Club Inferno, where<br />\nnumerous assaults had taken place<br />\nin the preceeding months,<br />\nappeared before the Liquor Board<br />\nin February, 1972, asking to sell<br />\nthe Club.<br />\nDiscussing Majette's Block<br />\ncompatriots, his lawyer said,<br />\n\"They're just not ready yet\u2014even<br />\nin 1972\u2014for a black owner.\"<br />\nIn a series of Sunpaper articles<br />\nlast summer, reporter G. Jefferson<br />\nPrice III examined the curious<br />\nrelationship between<br />\nestablishments on The Block, and<br />\nthe city's Liquor Board, whose<br />\noffice is less than a block away.<br />\nThe Liquor Board, with a part-time<br />\ndirector and sixteen politically<br />\nappointed inspectors, has never<br />\ninitiated a vice case against a Block<br />\nestablishment.<br />\nIn fact, Price showed licensing<br />\ndecisions are generally undertaicen<br />\nwithout any attempt being made<br />\nto determine just who the licensee<br />\nr<br />\n<br />\nIn a mere fi teen minutes, Price<br />\nsaid, at least four Liquor Board<br />\nrules had been broken, and the<br />\n<br />\nopportunity to break a fifth,<br />\nregarding sexual acts,\u2022 had been<br />\noffered, in each establishment.<br />\nWhile the showgirls openly<br />\ndisregard rules which prohibit \"any<br />\nperson to appear in any act...with<br />\nbreasts or lower torso exposed,\"<br />\nand those which prohibit<br />\nsolicitation for drinks, Price<br />\nexplained:<br />\n\"Entertaining on the stage is<br />\npossible the least important role of<br />\nthe females\u2014an-id some males\u2014who<br />\nwork in these bars.<br />\n\"The idea is mainly to get a<br />\ncustomer seated with a drink in his<br />\nhand as fast as possible.

In court, a year later, the<br />\ndefendents, including a former bar<br />\nowner who ahd been \"bannished\"<br />\nfrom The Block by the Liquor<br />\nBoard, charged that the policemen<br />\n<br />\n4.<br />\n<br />\n\u2022<br />\n<br />\n4<br />\n<br />\n\u2022<br />\n<br />\nhad not identified themselves, and, scheduled to be demolished, so<br />\nfurther, had called two club that construction may begin on the<br />\n<br />\nperformers \"fags.\"<br />\n<br />\nA Man Can Get a Job<br />\n<br />\nCity vice squad enforcement is<br />\nnot really a problem for most<br />\nBlock customers. Each<br />\nestablishment has a set of<br />\nbouncers, normally with long<br />\npolice records\u2014The Block is about<br />\nthe only place in town where a<br />\nman can get a job with no<br />\nquestions asked\u2014 who maintain a<br />\npeculiar brand of order, and<br />\nremove potential troublemakers,<br />\nnormally without concern for their<br />\nconstitutional rights.<br />\nThe decayed structures of The<br />\nBlock appear to be threatened by<br />\nmore than simple gravity. It's<br />\nsuccess has aways been tied to the<br />\ncity's harbor. During World War II,<br />\nNavy personnel and workers in the<br />\nshipyards and steel plants would<br />\nliven their evenings by occasional<br />\nvisits to The Block. More recently,<br />\nforeign seamen have been<br />\nresponsible for an influx of<br />\ncurrency.<br />\nIn 1970, for instance, 4,660<br />\nships docked here-3,465 of<br />\nforeign registry. One source<br />\nestimates that each ship employs<br />\nan average of 35 people of which<br />\nabout 25 go ashore with money to<br />\nspend. According to one retired<br />\nseaman, most of their expenses are<br />\nfor the Block's entertainments.<br />\nMore and more foreigners, however<br />\nare eschewing The Block, he added.<br />\nIn three years, The Block is<br />\n<br />\nnew Harbor campus of the<br />\nCommunity College of Baltimore.<br />\nAnd last June, the Baltimore City<br />\nCouncil agreed to consider putting<br />\nup off-street parking where some<br />\nof The Block's establishments now<br />\nstand.<br />\nCity Councilman Robert<br />\nDouglass, 2nd district Democrat,<br />\nand a colleague of Hopkins Dean<br />\nof Students Robert J. Fiztpatrick,<br />\nadmitted that any such off-street<br />\nfacility would not necessarily require<br />\nthe demolition of any of The<br />\nBlock.<br />\nRecent Supreme Court rulings<br />\nthat \"community standards\" may<br />\nbe applied to determine just what<br />\nis obscene are similarly unclear in<br />\ntheir relevance to The Block. Dirty<br />\nbook stores, while already targets<br />\nof crack-downs, continue their<br />\noperations. For twenty-five cents,<br />\nthe viewer is able to to watch a one<br />\nminute peep-show, if his eyes can<br />\nadjust to the scene. Pornography<br />\nis still on sale. Even if wholesale<br />\nprosecutions are undertaken,<br />\nlawyers for Block establishments<br />\nwill ?robably.argue that The Block<br />\nis a \"community\" in itself, and<br />\nthat alleged pornography does not<br />\naffront that community's<br />\nstandards.<br />\nAnother challenge comes from<br />\nthe massage parlors which have<br />\nsprung up throughout the city.<br />\nWhile these must lack some of the<br />\nexcitement which seems to endear<br />\n<br />\nThe Block to the more desperate<br />\nhabitue, for whom the naughty<br />\nlife is available in whatever<br />\nincrements he can afford, they are<br />\npresumable safer and more<br />\nconvenient than the inner harbor<br />\nattractions.<br />\nAs might be expected, working<br />\nconditions for Block employees<br />\nare far from normal. During last<br />\nsummer's heat wave, in fact, one<br />\nwoman complained of \"having<br />\nonly seven splits and six drinks\"<br />\nthe day before. \"I normally do 15<br />\nto 20 splits, and many more<br />\ndrinks ,\" she added.<br />\nMany of the female dancers,<br />\nthough, seem to lead normal<br />\nfamily lives, and have their<br />\nhusbands pick them up after work,<br />\nwhile the men whose evenings are<br />\nspent waiting for promises to be<br />\nrealized stare absently ahead.<br />\nNot all the dancers are women.<br />\nOne case last summer involved a<br />\nfemale impersonator arrested after<br />\nsoliciting a police officer. The<br />\narrest came in a so-called \"milk<br />\nbar,\" 13 days after the Liquor<br />\nBoard had revoked the<br />\nestablishment's license, and 12<br />\nr it open d as\"<br />\nimpersonator also\u2014di( a dance set<br />\nunder the name of\"Kim.\"<br />\nWhenever the police attempt to<br />\nclean up smut, normally following<br />\na series of indictments of officers,<br />\nor charges of other irregularities,<br />\nthe result might be seen as overkill.<br />\nIn one particularly prodigal<br />\nseries of raids, conducted in,July,<br />\n1972, agents confiscated, from 23<br />\nbars, over $10,700 in cash and<br />\nchecks, 750 bottles of opened<br />\nliquor, 800 bottles of sealed liquor,<br />\n133 cases of beer, and 250 bottles<br />\nof champagne. Two months later,<br />\n!Judge Alexander Harvey<br />\ndetermined that none of the bar<br />\noperators showed \"criminal<br />\nintent\" and said they had \"done<br />\nno more than violate tax law<br />\nprovisions.\" Judge Harvey ordered<br />\nall the confiscated material<br />\nreturned, with the exception of<br />\nseveral handguns, and suspected<br />\nmarijuana removed from individual<br />\npatrons.<br />\nMore recently, a Federal probe<br />\nhas been underway to determine<br />\njust who owns which The Block's<br />\nestablishments.<br />\nNow, with Baltimore's<br />\nfan tasyland turned into a bad<br />\ndream, in which real people pass<br />\ntheir lives, The Block seems to be<br />\nwaiting for its end. A Saturday<br />\nmorning walk through East<br />\nBalitmore Street reveals a tableau<br />\nwhich Voltaire might have<br />\nunderstood.

White Athletic<br />\nCenter is gearing up for an<br />\nexpected increase in the<br />\nutilization of its facilities this fall<br />\nas the Homewood community<br />\nreturns for the 1973-74 academic<br />\nyear.<br />\nAfter a marked dropoff in<br />\nusage of the Center following the<br />\nelimination of the required<br />\nphysical education classes some<br />\nfour years ago, the athletic staff<br />\nhas noticed a continuing growth<br />\nof student activity in both the<br />\nrecreational and competitive<br />\nfields.<br />\nIn response to this growing<br />\nparticipation, the athletic<br />\ndepartment has expanded its<br />\nprogram of courses and improved<br />\nmany of the facilities in the<br />\ncomplex.<br />\nThe competent staff at the<br />\nCenter is making every effort to<br />\nmeet the needs of the individual<br />\nseeking diversion from the<br />\noppressive atmosphere of C<br />\nLevel. Activities ranging from a<br />\ngame of ping-pong to the full<br />\nfledged intercollegiate varsities<br />\nare available, depending on one's<br />\ninclination.<br />\nFor simple recreation, the<br />\nCenter provides basketballs,<br />\nwater polo balls, handballs,<br />\n<br />\nlacrosse sticks, tennis rackets,<br />\nand the equipment for badminton<br />\nvolleyball, paddleball, ping-pong<br />\nand pocket billiards . all of<br />\nwhich may be borrowed on a<br />\nUniversity I.D. card. For the<br />\nwater set, the Center opens its<br />\ncompetition -sized pool and<br />\nseparate diving area for<br />\nrecreational swimming during the<br />\nnoon hour and from 3:30 to ten<br />\nMonday through Friday, noon to<br />\nfour on Saturday, and one to<br />\nnine on Sunday. Gymnastics<br />\nequipment is also available for<br />\nuse by clubs.<br />\nA limited number of lockers<br />\nare available to students and<br />\nfaculty members who will be<br />\nusing the Athletic facilities. The<br />\nlocker and inner gear service for<br />\nmen and women is available at<br />\nthe Athletic Office for a $7.00<br />\nfee that covers the whole school<br />\nyear. A few lockers in each main<br />\nlockerroom are reserved for daily<br />\nuse by students who have their<br />\nown inner gear and padlock, but<br />\nthese lockers must be vacated<br />\nafter each use.<br />\nTo insure efficient use of the<br />\ncomplex, the Athletic<br />\nDepartment has undertaken a<br />\nrepair program that has seen<br />\nevery shower head replaced, an<br />\nimprovement of the inner gear<br />\n<br />\nlaundry service, and the painting<br />\nof the squash courts. The weight<br />\ntraining and exercise room<br />\nshould be fully operational<br />\nwithin days as all the wall<br />\nequipment and the Universal<br />\nGym are scheduled for repairs<br />\ntoday. Moreover, the Center has<br />\narranged to have the bowling<br />\nalleys operational for the first<br />\ntime in the memory of current<br />\nstudents. Subjects to contract<br />\nfulfillment, the two ten pin lanes<br />\nshould be ready for use by the<br />\nend of September or the middle<br />\nof October.

What the document as printed<br />\nin yesterday's Gazette does not point out, however, is the fact<br />\nthat Hopkins and Goucher are very different, even on<br />\nsubsequent blushes.<br />\nHopkins, with a world-wide reputation as a university<br />\ndedicated to teaching, research and scholarship on a very high<br />\nlevel is simply a vastly different institution from Goucher,<br />\nknown in some quarters as a finishing school, a country club, or<br />\na home for unmarried maidens. While these descriptions are not<br />\nnecessarily either accurate or perceptive, they are far more<br />\nforthright than is the report, at least in certain areas, such as<br />\nthe state of Goucher's finances and the academic ability of its<br />\nstudents.<br />\nFirst, the draft version of the report, obtained by the<br />\nNews-Letter, labeled \"Final Report,\" and dated July 24, notes<br />\nthat the committee heard an unrecorded oral report on the state<br />\nof Goucher's finances. Since reports are widespread that<br />\nGoucher is in precarious financial condition, the Hopkins<br />\ncommunity should be informed as to the true situation before it<br />\nis asked to consider any plans whatsoever involving Goucher.<br />\nFurthermore, Hopkins has just come off five straight years of<br />\ndeficit budgets and is in no position to take on a poor relation.<br />\nThe Gazette's version of the report was also less than candid<br />\nin its failure to mention \u2014as the July 24 version mentions\u2014that<br />\nthe average SAT-Math score of a Goucher freshman is nearly<br />\n120 points below that of a Hopkins freshman and that the<br />\nVerbal score of the Goucher freshmen averages 62.4 points<br />\nbelow the figure for Hopkins freshmen. The final report also<br />\nfailed to point out that Goucher accepts nearly 80 percent of its<br />\napplicants while Hopkins accepts just over half.<br />\nGiven the financial situation and the academic standards of<br />\nthe women's school up the road, it is certainly unlikely that a<br />\nGoucher division of the Johns Hopkins University would ever<br />\nbecome more than a tolerated younger sibling, loved despite its<br />\nfaults. Even if this judgement should one day prove to have<br />\nbeen pessimistic, it is certainly wrong to expect the Hopkins<br />\ncommunity to make an intelligent decision on its future<br />\nrelationship to Goucher on the basis of the incomplete and<br />\nsomewhat misleading information thus far officially made<br />\navailable.<br /><br />\nlet them ring<br />\n\u2022 Student Council President Andrew W. Savitz's decision to<br />\ndrop the discipline issue \"like a hot potato\" this year can only<br />\nas. an SC. afftatioti o\u00a3,the ti.*t of students bete to be<br />\nprocedures.<br /><br />\ny e ectvely<br /><br />\niJing 1/<br />\n1<br />\n24; iff-conceived discipline<br /><br />\nCode, the Student Council has taken the first step towards a<br /><br />\ncomplete re-thinking of some problems here.<br />\nWe should now like to propose that three regulations here<br />\nbe changed or dropped, and that some phones be repaired:<br />\n1. Part-time study for undergraduates: Following a<br />\nrecommendation by the Committee on Undergraduate Studies,<br />\nchaired by Dean of Academic Programs Dr. Sigmund Suskind,<br />\nthe Academic Council last spring promulgated regulation<br />\nproscribing part-time study by students in their final two years<br />\nof undergraduate residency here. While we recognize, the<br />\nfinancial expediencies to be realized by such a proscription, we<br />\nfeel that students are unduly restricted in their ability to plan<br />\nmeaningful and flexible curricula. This proscription should join<br />\nthe two-cent postcard and dinosaurs.<br />\n2. Non-resident fee for graduate students: Grad students who<br />\ndesire to take a leave of absence are currently being milked by<br />\nthe University for the privilege of being somewhere else. This is<br />\nsimply absurd.<br />\nIn addition, the University catalog states that students on<br />\nleave are not to be \"physically present on the Homewood<br />\ncampus.\" \"Physically.\" We don't know exactly what they have<br />\nin mind, but we think it's pretty heavy.<br />\n3. Faculty night at the gymnasium: Students are prohibited<br />\nfrom being in the Newton H. White, Jr. Athletic Center on<br />\nThursday evenings. At this time, faculty are allowed to play<br />\nSquash and basketball, and to swim, without having noxious<br />\nHoppies underfoot. Commendable as this may be, few faculty<br />\nmembers in fact take advantage of the special hours, and those<br />\nwho do frequent the gym often_ enough not to merit this<br />\noutrageous favoritism.<br />\n4: Toward the end of the summer, the telephone bells were<br />\ndisconnected from University phones in Wolman Hall. We find<br />\nthis peculiar. Telephones, we feel, ought not to be castrated,<br />\nespecially when one of their primary functions is thus<br />\neliminated.<br /><br />\nu1111111.Commigasel,<br /><br />\nphotographs by jeff posner<br /><br />\nThe BLOCK: Baltimore's Show of Shows<br />\nBy B.H. COHEN<br />\n$25 you can buy a bottle of<br />\ncheap champagne and retreat to a<br />\ncurtained-in booth at the back of a<br />\nroom to have \"some fun.\" Or, if<br />\nyou just want to pass the time, you<br />\ncan buy two drinks, one for<br />\nyourself, and one for your<br />\nnew-found friend, for $2.75<br />\napiece, plus tip.<br />\nFor the most part, The Block is<br />\nsafe. The businessmen there are<br />\nnormally content to conduct their<br />\nrip-offs without serious incident,<br />\nmaximizing ,profit and alienating<br />\nfew. One frequenter said, \"This is<br />\none of the safest blocks in the<br />\ncity.\"<br />\n\"Unless you have business to<br />\ntransact there,\" he added.<br />\nThis is The Block, the<br />\nonce-ornate arcade of burlesque,<br />\ndrink, and American fantasy<br />\nculture.<br />\nBuilt up largely at the turn of<br />\nthe century, The Block thrived<br />\nduring the thirties, when Gypsy<br />\nRose Lee and a host of lesser<br />\nluminaries would offer an evening<br />\nof good clean catcalling fun. The<br />\nBlock hit the skids following World<br />\nWas 1,1 Tockw,even the fl. ouses<br />\nremanis, w<br />\ncan get a<br />\nroom for less than two dollars a<br />\nFor<br /><br />\nnight.<br /><br />\nNow, while local politicians<br />\nhaggle over the Inner Harbor<br />\nrenewal scheme, The Block lives<br />\non, almost somnambulates, waiting<br />\nonly for its inevitable encounter<br />\nwith the wrecker's ball.<br />\nSprawling around the 500 block<br />\nEast Baltimore Street, The Block<br />\noffers some small intimation of its<br />\nformer glory. At the Two O'Clock<br />\nClub, for instance, Blaze Starr, a<br />\nforty-ish stripper with a legendary<br />\nset of Cooer's ligaments, etc., will<br />\ndo her a bump-and-grind for an<br />\naudience of middle-class folks out<br />\nfor an evening of taking in the<br />\nsights, and for young men whose<br />\ncuriosities have been piqued.<br />\nThe rest of The Block is<br />\nsubstantially less suitable for<br />\nfamily diversion. The Block,<br />\naccording to a Baltimore City<br />\ngrand jury report released early<br />\nthis year, is the host for a myriad<br />\nof illegal acitivities, beyond mere<br />\nprostitution. The Grand Jury<br />\nindicated that:<br />\n\"1. Highly organized criminal<br />\ninterests appear to have a great<br />\namount of control on activities in<br />\nThe Block. They are engaged in<br />\ngambling, narcotics traffic, murder<br />\nfor hire, prostitution, and other<br />\nharmful acts against society.<br />\n\"2. Control of these activities<br />\nappears to be headquartered in<br />\nPhiladelphia. Local names on<br />\nBlock liquor licenses appear to be a<br />\nsham.\"<br />\nLong tolerated by those<br /><br />\nresponsible for the enlightenment<br />\nof Baltimorean mores, as somehow<br />\n\"necessary,\" or \"expedient,\" The<br />\nBlock has shown its Southern<br />\nhospitality in another way: Floyd<br />\nJ. Majette, Jr., the black former<br />\nowner of the Club Inferno, where<br />\nnumerous assaults had taken place<br />\nin the preceeding months,<br />\nappeared before the Liquor Board<br />\nin February, 1972, asking to sell<br />\nthe Club.<br />\nDiscussing Majette's Block<br />\ncompatriots, his lawyer said,<br />\n\"They're just not ready yet\u2014even<br />\nin 1972\u2014for a black owner.\"<br />\nIn a series of Sunpaper articles<br />\nlast summer, reporter G. Jefferson<br />\nPrice III examined the curious<br />\nrelationship between<br />\nestablishments on The Block, and<br />\nthe city's Liquor Board, whose<br />\noffice is less than a block away.<br />\nThe Liquor Board, with a part-time<br />\ndirector and sixteen politically<br />\nappointed inspectors, has never<br />\ninitiated a vice case against a Block<br />\nestablishment.<br />\nIn fact, Price showed licensing<br />\ndecisions are generally undertaicen<br />\nwithout any attempt being made<br />\nto determine just who the licensee<br />\nr<br /><br />\nIn a mere fi teen minutes, Price<br />\nsaid, at least four Liquor Board<br />\nrules had been broken, and the<br /><br />\nopportunity to break a fifth,<br />\nregarding sexual acts,\u2022 had been<br />\noffered, in each establishment.<br />\nWhile the showgirls openly<br />\ndisregard rules which prohibit \"any<br />\nperson to appear in any act...with<br />\nbreasts or lower torso exposed,\"<br />\nand those which prohibit<br />\nsolicitation for drinks, Price<br />\nexplained:<br />\n\"Entertaining on the stage is<br />\npossible the least important role of<br />\nthe females\u2014an-id some males\u2014who<br />\nwork in these bars.<br />\n\"The idea is mainly to get a<br />\ncustomer seated with a drink in his<br />\nhand as fast as possible. Next<br />\ncomes the girl in her underwear<br />\nwho wants a bottle of<br />\nchampagne\u2014California brands at<br />\nParis prices.<br />\n\"With the champagne comes the<br />\npromise of 'a little fun in the<br />\nback.\"<br />\nBaltimore Police Department<br />\nVice Squad members are singularly<br />\nremarkable in their abilities to<br />\nwatch over The Block's legal<br />\noperations.<br />\nIn July 1971, for instance, a<br />\npolice sergeant whose partner had<br />\nbeen solicited to buy a $2.75<br />\ndrink, and then a $25 bottle of<br />\nchampagne, was beaten by four<br />\nmen, and thrown unconscious into<br />\nan alley. In court, a year later, the<br />\ndefendents, including a former bar<br />\nowner who ahd been \"bannished\"<br />\nfrom The Block by the Liquor<br />\nBoard, charged that the policemen<br /><br />\n4.<br /><br />\n\u2022<br /><br />\n4<br /><br />\n\u2022<br /><br />\nhad not identified themselves, and, scheduled to be demolished, so<br />\nfurther, had called two club that construction may begin on the<br /><br />\nperformers \"fags.\"<br /><br />\nA Man Can Get a Job<br /><br />\nCity vice squad enforcement is<br />\nnot really a problem for most<br />\nBlock customers. Each<br />\nestablishment has a set of<br />\nbouncers, normally with long<br />\npolice records\u2014The Block is about<br />\nthe only place in town where a<br />\nman can get a job with no<br />\nquestions asked\u2014 who maintain a<br />\npeculiar brand of order, and<br />\nremove potential troublemakers,<br />\nnormally without concern for their<br />\nconstitutional rights.<br />\nThe decayed structures of The<br />\nBlock appear to be threatened by<br />\nmore than simple gravity. It's<br />\nsuccess has aways been tied to the<br />\ncity's harbor. During World War II,<br />\nNavy personnel and workers in the<br />\nshipyards and steel plants would<br />\nliven their evenings by occasional<br />\nvisits to The Block. More recently,<br />\nforeign seamen have been<br />\nresponsible for an influx of<br />\ncurrency.<br />\nIn 1970, for instance, 4,660<br />\nships docked here-3,465 of<br />\nforeign registry. One source<br />\nestimates that each ship employs<br />\nan average of 35 people of which<br />\nabout 25 go ashore with money to<br />\nspend. According to one retired<br />\nseaman, most of their expenses are<br />\nfor the Block's entertainments.<br />\nMore and more foreigners, however<br />\nare eschewing The Block, he added.<br />\nIn three years, The Block is<br /><br />\nnew Harbor campus of the<br />\nCommunity College of Baltimore.<br />\nAnd last June, the Baltimore City<br />\nCouncil agreed to consider putting<br />\nup off-street parking where some<br />\nof The Block's establishments now<br />\nstand.<br />\nCity Councilman Robert<br />\nDouglass, 2nd district Democrat,<br />\nand a colleague of Hopkins Dean<br />\nof Students Robert J. Fiztpatrick,<br />\nadmitted that any such off-street<br />\nfacility would not necessarily require<br />\nthe demolition of any of The<br />\nBlock.<br />\nRecent Supreme Court rulings<br />\nthat \"community standards\" may<br />\nbe applied to determine just what<br />\nis obscene are similarly unclear in<br />\ntheir relevance to The Block. Dirty<br />\nbook stores, while already targets<br />\nof crack-downs, continue their<br />\noperations. For twenty-five cents,<br />\nthe viewer is able to to watch a one<br />\nminute peep-show, if his eyes can<br />\nadjust to the scene. Pornography<br />\nis still on sale. Even if wholesale<br />\nprosecutions are undertaken,<br />\nlawyers for Block establishments<br />\nwill ?robably.argue that The Block<br />\nis a \"community\" in itself, and<br />\nthat alleged pornography does not<br />\naffront that community's<br />\nstandards.<br />\nAnother challenge comes from<br />\nthe massage parlors which have<br />\nsprung up throughout the city.<br />\nWhile these must lack some of the<br />\nexcitement which seems to endear<br /><br />\nThe Block to the more desperate<br />\nhabitue, for whom the naughty<br />\nlife is available in whatever<br />\nincrements he can afford, they are<br />\npresumable safer and more<br />\nconvenient than the inner harbor<br />\nattractions.<br />\nAs might be expected, working<br />\nconditions for Block employees<br />\nare far from normal. During last<br />\nsummer's heat wave, in fact, one<br />\nwoman complained of \"having<br />\nonly seven splits and six drinks\"<br />\nthe day before. \"I normally do 15<br />\nto 20 splits, and many more<br />\ndrinks ,\" she added.<br />\nMany of the female dancers,<br />\nthough, seem to lead normal<br />\nfamily lives, and have their<br />\nhusbands pick them up after work,<br />\nwhile the men whose evenings are<br />\nspent waiting for promises to be<br />\nrealized stare absently ahead.<br />\nNot all the dancers are women.<br />\nOne case last summer involved a<br />\nfemale impersonator arrested after<br />\nsoliciting a police officer. The<br />\narrest came in a so-called \"milk<br />\nbar,\" 13 days after the Liquor<br />\nBoard had revoked the<br />\nestablishment's license, and 12<br />\nr it open d as\"<br />\nimpersonator also\u2014di( a dance set<br />\nunder the name of\"Kim.\"<br />\nWhenever the police attempt to<br />\nclean up smut, normally following<br />\na series of indictments of officers,<br />\nor charges of other irregularities,<br />\nthe result might be seen as overkill.<br />\nIn one particularly prodigal<br />\nseries of raids, conducted in,July,<br />\n1972, agents confiscated, from 23<br />\nbars, over $10,700 in cash and<br />\nchecks, 750 bottles of opened<br />\nliquor, 800 bottles of sealed liquor,<br />\n133 cases of beer, and 250 bottles<br />\nof champagne. Two months later,<br />\n!Judge Alexander Harvey<br />\ndetermined that none of the bar<br />\noperators showed \"criminal<br />\nintent\" and said they had \"done<br />\nno more than violate tax law<br />\nprovisions.\" Judge Harvey ordered<br />\nall the confiscated material<br />\nreturned, with the exception of<br />\nseveral handguns, and suspected<br />\nmarijuana removed from individual<br />\npatrons.<br />\nMore recently, a Federal probe<br />\nhas been underway to determine<br />\njust who owns which The Block's<br />\nestablishments.<br />\nNow, with Baltimore's<br />\nfan tasyland turned into a bad<br />\ndream, in which real people pass<br />\ntheir lives, The Block seems to be<br />\nwaiting for its end.

Activities ranging from a<br />\ngame of ping-pong to the full<br />\nfledged intercollegiate varsities<br />\nare available, depending on one's<br />\ninclination.<br />\nFor simple recreation, the<br />\nCenter provides basketballs,<br />\nwater polo balls, handballs,<br /><br />\nlacrosse sticks, tennis rackets,<br />\nand the equipment for badminton<br />\nvolleyball, paddleball, ping-pong<br />\nand pocket billiards . all of<br />\nwhich may be borrowed on a<br />\nUniversity I.D. card.

A few lockers in each main<br />\nlockerroom are reserved for daily<br />\nuse by students who have their<br />\nown inner gear and padlock, but<br />\nthese lockers must be vacated<br />\nafter each use.<br />\nTo insure efficient use of the<br />\ncomplex, the Athletic<br />\nDepartment has undertaken a<br />\nrepair program that has seen<br />\nevery shower head replaced, an<br />\nimprovement of the inner gear<br /><br />\nlaundry service, and the painting<br />\nof the squash courts. The weight<br />\ntraining and exercise room<br />\nshould be fully operational<br />\nwithin days as all the wall<br />\nequipment and the Universal<br />\nGym are scheduled for repairs<br />\ntoday.
