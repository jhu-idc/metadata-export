Most students<br />\nignore the (few) classes offered, and<br />\ndon't even return to campus until late<br />\nJanuary. That's a pity\u2014Intersession<br />\ncould be (and supposedly once was) the<br />\nmost interesting and fun part of the year.<br />\nAnd while there has been a lot of talk<br />\nthe last few years about improving Intersession, little has been done.<br />\nDean of the School of Arts and<br />\nSciences George Fisher claims Intersession is making a comeback. There has<br />\nbeen some \"movement\" towards improving it, he says. He has, for example,<br />\nstatistics showing that more Homewood<br />\nstudents took Intersession courses this<br />\nyear than ever before.<br />\nBut we have statistics showing that<br />\nthere were no engineering courses during Intersession this year. And even in<br />\nthe School of Arts and Sciences, what<br />\ncourses were offered were of extremely<br />\nlimited interest. Most were small, upperlevel seminars open only to upperclassmen in their own departments.<br />\nSo what is to be done about Intersession? Mark Komisky offers his own<br />\nprescriptions elsewhere on this page. As<br />\nfor the administration, Fisher's baby just<br />\nnow is the idea of intensive language<br />\ncourses. Such a course (in Korean) was<br />\nsuccessfully held this year, he says, and<br />\nplans are in the works for further attempts this summer. If that experiment<br />\nproves successful, Fisher envisions future<br />\nIntersessions in which highly-intensive<br />\nlanguage courses will be widely available.<br />\nThere certainly would be nothing<br />\nwrong with such a situation but neither<br />\nwould it be sufficient. So we have a far<br />\nmore radical proposal: require new<br />\nfaculty members to periodically teach Intersession courses.<br />\n<br />\nTraditionally, the problem with Intersession has been that faculty members<br />\nhardly ever teach. They don't get paid,<br />\nso there is no financial incentive, and<br />\nyounger professors often claim they need<br />\nthe time for research if they are to get<br />\ntenure. The equally traditional method<br />\nproposed for improving the term is to<br />\npay faculty members to teach, which was<br />\nalways rejected on financial grounds.<br />\nBut our program wouldn't cost a<br />\ndime. Merely make teaching an Intersession course periodically\u2014say every three<br />\nor four years\u2014a part of faculty<br />\nmembers'jobs. Obviously, this couldn't<br />\nbe hoisted on people who are already<br />\nhere without paying them more, so we<br />\nsuggest a 'grandfather clause.' Whenever<br />\na new faculty member is hired, make Intersession teaching a requirement.<br />\nWithin a few years, there would be a<br />\nwide variety of Intersession courses, and<br />\nit's hard to imagine that the prospect of<br />\nteaching an additional three-week course<br />\nevery four years would be so heinous a<br />\nburden as to discourage first-rate young<br />\nscholars from coming to Hopkins.<br />\nFisher says he is \"reluctant\" to \"set<br />\nup two separate classes of faculty<br />\nmembers.\" Oh, and why is that? Aren't<br />\nthere already three separate classes of<br />\nfaculty members? And surely Fisher is<br />\naware that there are faculty members<br />\nwith special perks: secretaries, light<br />\nteaching loads, etc. One guy even has his<br />\nown department. Will one more \"class\"<br />\nbe so horrible?<br />\nWe suspect our program doesn't have<br />\na chance of being adopted, but that is<br />\nhardly an argument against it. If Intersession is to be improved, dramatic<br />\nchanges\u2014not timid and traditional<br />\nmodifications\u2014will be needed.<br />\n<br />\nApartheid and Investments<br />\nFew issues have generated more controversy recently than Hopkins' South<br />\nAfrican investments. The matter came to<br />\na head during Intersession, when Bishop<br />\nTutu's visit publicized the University's<br />\nrelationship with South Africa.<br />\nBut while many student groups have<br />\njumped on the bandwagon and endorsed the idea of total divestment, we have<br />\nyet to comment on the issue. It is time<br />\n\\-\\that silence ended: the University ought<br />\nto divest itself of its South African<br />\ninvestments.<br />\nMorally, the issue is a simple one.

I took the course<br />\nsecond semester last year, and<br />\nit was the worst course I have<br />\never taken.<br />\nWickwire says in his course<br />\ndescription that \"guest<br />\nspeakers will participate.\" This<br />\nis a bit of an understatement:<br />\nwe had a different guest lecturer<br />\nevery week. Such a course<br />\ncould still be quite good if the<br />\nspeakers were chosen properly,<br />\nbut the fields of expertise of<br />\nmost of our speakers had<br />\nnothing to do with nonviolence.<br />\nFor example, we spent four<br />\nweeks listening to lectures on<br />\ndifferent aspects of nuclear<br />\nwar; we learned all about wartime economics, nuclear winter,<br />\nand the Strategic Defense Initiative. Half of our speakers<br />\ndid not even know they were<br />\nsupposed to talk about<br />\nnonviolence.<br />\nIf you don't really care about<br />\nlearning about nonviolence and<br />\nare just looking for an easy A,<br />\nyou're looking in the wrong<br />\nplace. Wickwire wanted us to<br />\nknow that his course was no<br />\ngut, so he gave low grades on<br />\nthe midterm; of course, by then<br />\nit was too late to drop the<br />\ncourse. Furthermore, there<br />\nwere no comments anywhere<br />\non my midterm; there was just<br />\na grade. The same thing happened to several of my friends,<br />\nand we began to wonder<br />\nseriously whether or not our<br />\npapers had even been read.<br />\nI am not writing this letter as<br />\npart of a personal vendetta; I<br />\ntook the class pass/fail as a<br />\nfifth course, and I passed.

Cinemas: Down and Out at Harbor Place<br />\nDown and Out in Beverly Hills<br />\nDir. Paul Mazursky.<br />\nRichard Dreyfuss, Bette<br />\nMidler, Nick Nolte<br />\nby Laurah Limbrick<br />\nI caught this picture at the<br />\nnew UA film conplex down by<br />\nthe Inner Harbor, and I saw<br />\nsomething there that disturbed<br />\nme greatly. I'm talking about<br />\nthe hideous lava lamp blobs<br />\nthat the management insists on<br />\nshowing before each film. The<br />\nblobs look like mutant<br />\namoebas, and for over fifteen<br />\nminutes they floated and oozed<br />\nover the screen to the accompaniment of Willie Nelson. Unfortunately, the movie was only slightly better than the blobs.<br />\nThis film starts out on a pro-<br />\n<br />\nmising premise: what happens<br />\nwhen a destitute bum (Nick<br />\nNolte) invades the lives of the<br />\nnouveau riche Whiteman family? However, it fails to live up<br />\nto this intriguing idea.<br />\nRichard Dreyfuss is Dave<br />\nWhiteman, a clothing-hanger<br />\nmagnate who saves the life of<br />\nJerry (Nolte) when he tries to<br />\ndrown himself in the swimming<br />\npool of the Whiteman estate.<br />\nWhiteman has been undergoing<br />\nbourgeousie ennui; he's lost interest in his wife (Bette Midler),<br />\nhe can't communicate with his<br />\nson (Evan Richards), his<br />\ndaughter (Tracy Nelson) is a<br />\nborderline anorexic, and he's<br />\nhaving an affair with Carmen,<br />\nthe maid (Elizabeth Pena).<br />\nSo in a show of generosity,<br />\nhe takes Jerry under his wing<br />\n<br />\nHopkins' Very Own<br />\nString Quartet<br />\nby Jay Lechtman<br />\nThose of you lucky enough<br />\nto be doing your laundry last<br />\nSunday afternoon in the basement of AMR II would have<br />\nbeen serenaded by the university's newest music sensation,<br />\nthe Hopkins String Quartet.<br />\nThe quartet was organized by<br />\nfreshman Susan Stolovy<br />\nbecause \"I always loved playing chamber music, so I decided<br />\neven before I came here that I<br />\nwould form a group if one<br />\nwasn't already established.\"<br />\nThe group regularly plays in the<br />\nbasement practice rooms.<br />\nThe quartet, the only<br />\norganized university chamber<br />\nstring ensemble, consists of<br />\nStolovy on first violin,<br />\nfreshman Lucy Wilson on second violin, freshman Matt<br />\nWyant on cello, and University of Delaware graduate and<br />\nWestinghouse employee Paul<br />\nNelson on viola. Stolovy,<br />\nWilson, and Nelson, all<br />\nmembers of the Hopkins Symphony Orchestra, played exten-<br />\n<br />\nsively at state and regional<br />\nlevels before coming to<br />\nHopkins, and cellist Wyant performed in the Georgia All-State<br />\nOrchestra and the Atlanta<br />\nYouth Symphony before playing here. In addition, Wilson,<br />\nStolovy and Wyant are currently studying privately at the<br />\nPeabody Conservatory of<br />\nMusic.<br />\nThe group, which rehearses<br />\nextremely diligently for one<br />\nwhose primary purpose is \"to<br />\nhave fun,\" accomplishes that as<br />\nwell, joking between pieces,<br />\nand adapting music for their<br />\nenjoyment. \"Playing in a<br />\nquartet is more than in an orchestra,\" said Stolovy,<br />\n\"because of the close communication between each<br />\nmember.\"<br />\n\"Each person is important,\"<br />\nadded Wilson.<br />\nThe quartet will be performing in the Garrett Room of the<br />\nMSE Library, at 7:30 p.m. on<br />\nMarch 15, playing selections<br />\nfrom Schubert's Quartet in G<br />\nMinor,<br />\nand<br />\nDvorak's<br />\n\"American\" Quartet.<br />\n<br />\nThe Latest Crop<br />\nof Albee Plays<br />\nby Jason Hanson<br />\n\"6 Plays\" read the program<br />\nI was handed at the door.<br />\nBelow that was printed \"under<br />\nthe supervision of Edward<br />\nAlbee.\" Delighted to be present<br />\nat theater under the auspices of<br />\nso eminent a playwright as<br />\nAlbee, I eagerly took my seat<br />\nfor the most recent presentation<br />\nof one-act plays written by<br />\nstudents of the Writing<br />\nSeminars department.<br />\nMy mood, however, was<br />\nsoon deflated when Edward<br />\nAlbee himself appeared on<br />\nstage to announce his connection with the productions. He<br />\n<br />\ngave much due credit to the<br />\nplaywrights and directors of the<br />\nevening's dramas and to professor Robert Arellano, the<br />\ndriving force behind student<br />\ntheater at Johns Hopkins. But<br />\nAlbee could not take credit for<br />\nmuch direction except when<br />\nstudents specifically consulted<br />\nhim or when he felt that a scene<br />\nobviously needed rewriting.<br />\nDespite this lack of strong<br />\nprofessional guidance, though,<br />\nthe productions came off quite<br />\nwell.<br />\nAt the head of the program<br />\nwas Jay/Alfred written by<br />\nDavid Charles and directed by<br />\nContinued on Page 14<br />\n<br />\nand tries to rehabilitate him. Instead of gratitude, however,<br />\nJerry displays hostility, which<br />\nonly intrigues Dave more. So<br />\nJerry is invited to stay in the<br />\nWhiteman home indefinitely,<br />\nthus setting the stage for what<br />\nshould be an uproarious clash<br />\nof customs and ideas, but<br />\nwhich fails to deliver.<br />\nThe first enemy Jerry makes<br />\nis Mrs. Whiteman, who regards<br />\nhim with disgust and open<br />\nhostility. Bette Midler does a<br />\nfine job in her role as the<br />\nstereotypical JAP housewife<br />\nwho is gradually won over by<br />\nJerry's charm. We aren't asked<br />\nto pity Jerry, rather, he is a<br />\nman of mystery, who comes into a situation and changes the<br />\nlives of everyone and then he's<br />\ngone. And Mrs. Whiteman cer-<br />\n<br />\ntainly doesn't feel any sympathy towards Jerry in the<br />\nbeginning; \"That bum is not<br />\nstaying in my house!\" she<br />\nscreeches when Dave tells her<br />\nthat Jerry will be hanging<br />\naround for a while. However,<br />\nshe, as well as the rest of the<br />\nfamily, is touched by Jerry as<br />\nthe story goes on.<br />\nJust when everyone else is<br />\nbeginning to really like Jerry,<br />\nthough, Dave finds that Jerry<br />\nis starting to get on his nerves.<br />\nHe becomes disillusioned with<br />\nthe charismatic drifter when he<br />\nrealizes that Jerry is taking over<br />\ntheir lives; this provides the<br />\nfunniest moments in the film.<br />\nDave is at odds with the rest of<br />\nhis family, and the positions are<br />\nnow reversed; he wants Jerry<br />\nout, but they want him to stay.<br />\n<br />\nIn the end, it's all tied up a bit<br />\ntoo neatly to leave the viewer<br />\nsatisfied.<br />\nWhat makes this film not as<br />\nbad as it could have been,<br />\nthough, are the fine performances by Nolte, Dreyfuss,<br />\nMidler, and Little Richard as a<br />\nrecord producer and Beverly<br />\nHills<br />\nundesirable.<br />\nThe<br />\nWhiteman family dog, Matisse,<br />\nnearly steals the show. Strong<br />\nportrayals, no matter how bad<br />\nthe material, kept this picture<br />\nfrom being a total flop. The<br />\nideas behind Down and Out in<br />\nBeverly Hills must have seemed<br />\nquite funny on paper.<br />\nHowever, the director's execution of the script didn't come<br />\noff quite as well as it could<br />\nhave.<br />\n<br />\nArts Calendar!<br />\nMOVIES:<br />\nSenior Class Film Series:<br />\nThe Spy Who Loved Me and<br />\nLive and Let Die.

Jay, an optimist of<br />\nsorts, molds reality to conform<br />\nto his rosy view of the duo's<br />\nmeager situation. Alfred insists<br />\nthat the truth conforms to a less<br />\ncheerful reality. The interplay<br />\nbetween the two actors was<br />\nlimited by the writing of the<br />\nplay but was adequate enough<br />\nto convey that the two were<br />\nmerely components of one<br />\npersonality.<br />\nAll Souls Day, written by<br />\nJames Boylan and directed by<br />\nHerman Ayayo, explored the<br />\nattempts of a pious widower<br />\nand a runaway girl to communicate with loved ones lost<br />\nor far away. It also raised some<br />\nserious questions about the<br />\nnature of our beliefs. The<br />\ndialogue suggested that the girl<br />\nwas the spirit of the man's<br />\ndaughter who had been lost in<br />\ninfancy, but this identity, as the<br />\nman's \"problem\" was not<br />\n<br />\nmurder of a Lousiana woman.<br />\nIts straightforward presentation, assisted by a convincing<br />\nperformance of the woman's<br />\nmurder by Peter Piccinini, gave<br />\na painfully honest treatment of<br />\nthis discomforting subject.<br />\nA Process ofInspiration, the<br />\npresentation's final play, written by Herman Ayayo and<br />\ndirected by Robbie Simon, offered comic relief and some of<br />\nthe finest acting of the evening.<br />\nStrong performances by Jim<br />\nSullivan as a writer who has run<br />\nout of ideas and by Marc<br />\nSalevitz as his flitting,<br />\nhomosexual publisher enlivened<br />\na substantial script. The play<br />\nwas among the best written of<br />\nthe six, even though its ending<br />\nleft a few too many questions<br />\nunanswered.<br />\nOn the whole, the six plays<br />\nrepresented a decent attempt to<br />\nproduce student written plays<br />\nwith student actors on stage at<br />\nJohns Hopkins. Although each<br />\nwas flawed in one way or<br />\nanother and although the<br />\ntechnical direction could use a<br />\nlot of help, with practice good<br />\nstudent theater and J.H.U. may<br />\ncome to be equated more often.<br />\n<br />\nmade clear.<br />\nNo Stopping Anytime, written by Duncan Smith and<br />\ndirected by Anne-Marie Ulrich,<br />\nlooked at two college alumni at<br />\ntheir ten-year reunion.

He says, \"They have to<br />\nexist by themselves, to justify<br />\nthemselves without any indication of what is happening,<br />\nwithout any image, without any<br />\nface, without any countryside,<br />\nwithout a tear, without a<br />\nsilence.. .Incredulous, I read<br />\nand reread this naked and<br />\nbloodless text.

He will ask bluntly, \"Are<br />\nPolish women glad there are no<br />\nJewesses left?\" or \"How did it<br />\nlook, the gas chamber. Can you<br />\ndescribe it precisely?\" or \"So<br />\nit was (you) who dug up and<br />\nburned all the Jews of Vilna?\"<br />\nThroughout the text, certain<br />\nimages and themes recur and<br />\nreinforce themselves, a repetition that is deliberately<br />\nshocking\u2014the mass graves, the<br />\ntrains that brought the Jews<br />\n(sometimes ignorant of their<br />\ndestination) to the death camps,<br />\nthe disbelief and horror of<br />\nthose involved to what was happening, the gas chambers, the<br />\n<br />\nNazi drive to make the camps<br />\nmore \"efficient,\" and the pain<br />\nof those who watched their<br />\nfriends and family die in the<br />\ncamps while they were unable<br />\nto help.<br />\nIn one segment, a barber<br />\nwho, along with numerous<br />\nother professional barbers, was<br />\nrecruited by the Germans to cut<br />\nthe hair of the women as they<br />\nentered the gas chamber of<br />\nTreblinka, describes what happened when the wife and sister<br />\nof one of his colleagues walked<br />\ninto the chamber:<br />\n\"They tried to talk to him<br />\nand the husband of his sister.<br />\nThey [the men] could not tell<br />\nthem this was the last time they<br />\n[would be] alive, because behind<br />\nthem was the Nazis.

First published in 1950,<br />\nit has now been reissued by Little, Brown & Company. The<br />\npoems in it were taken from<br />\nand<br />\ncollections<br />\nearlier<br />\nmagazines in which Nash<br />\npublished. As its title suggests,<br />\nthe general theme of the book<br />\nis family life. None of the<br />\npoems in it is to be taken<br />\nseriously. They range from<br />\npatently silly to brilliantly funny. And every one of them may<br />\nin some way be described as<br />\nstrange.<br />\nMany critics refuse to ascribe<br />\nthe description \"poetry\" to<br />\nNash's work at all, preferring<br />\ninstead words like \"light verse\"<br />\nand \"humorous rhyme.\" In<br />\nfact, Nash himself seems only<br />\nto have to called his work<br />\n\"verse.\" Nevertheless, such a<br />\ndescription hardly seems adequate to describe some of the<br />\nmost ingenious rhyme and<br />\nwordplay ever constructed in<br />\nEnglish to delight its readers.<br />\nNash was prolific. His<br />\npublished poems on all subjects<br />\nnumber in the thousands. After<br />\n<br />\nspending a year at Harvard, he<br />\nended up contributing regularly to The New Yorker and<br />\nworking on the young magazine's editorial staff helping<br />\nestablish its sophisticated tone.<br />\nLike E.B. White, his command<br />\nof the language was tremendous and he was often at his<br />\nbest writing for children. He<br />\nlived in Baltimore until he died<br />\nin 1972.<br />\nFamily Reunion is not a<br />\nchildren's book; but it comes<br />\nclose. Almost every poem<br />\nwould be understandable to a<br />\nchild. The topic of each could<br />\nnot be more mundane. But the<br />\nfantastic thing about his poems<br />\nis that he takes such ordinary<br />\nthings and talks about them in<br />\nsuch simple ways and in spite<br />\nof, or because of this, his<br />\npoetry remains engaging, a<br />\ndelight to read.<br />\nNash's style is unique. Many<br />\nhave tried to imitate him but all<br />\nhave failed. He wrote with a<br />\ncombination of bizzare rhyme<br />\nand untamed meter. He distorts<br />\nwords and phrases to bring<br />\nthem together in the most<br />\nunlikely rhymes. The first line<br />\nof a typical rhyming couplet<br />\nmay be three syllables while the<br />\nsecond may extend for a<br />\nparagraph. All of this makes<br />\nfor very colorful, if unconventional, verse.<br />\nThe topics that Nash chose<br />\nfor the poems in this book are<br />\n<br />\nthe most ordinary happenings<br />\nin typical upper-middle-class<br />\nfamilies. As Nash wrote in his<br />\nforeward, \"I have been a<br />\nmember of one family or<br />\nanother all my life. I think<br />\nfamilies are interesting. Only in<br />\nthe family do we find the battle between the sexes raging<br />\nconcurrently with the battle between the generations. It<br />\nfascinates me to note the<br />\nvarious ways in which a husband can please or infuriate a<br />\nwife and a wife can baffle or<br />\nbutter up a husband; I follow<br />\nwith delight the vacillations of<br />\nboth between pride and despair<br />\nwhen facing their young; and I<br />\ncan sympathize with if not approve the attempts of the young<br />\nto muscle in on such adult<br />\nmonopolies as interrupting,<br />\ntalking back, staying up late,<br />\nand evading the issue.\"<br />\nMost of the poems here are<br />\nnot weighed down by the period<br />\nin which they were written; but<br />\nsome are definitely products of<br />\ntheir times, portrayals of the<br />\nideal WASP family. Reading<br />\nthese is like watching June and<br />\nWard Cleaver trying to raise<br />\nWally and the Beav. But even<br />\nfor readers who were not raised<br />\nin such a family, they can be<br />\nvery amusing, both for their<br />\nstereotypical images and for the<br />\ninimitable style in which they<br />\nare written.<br />\nMost of the poems in the<br />\n<br />\nbook, however, go beyond the<br />\nnarrow confines of the<br />\nAmerican bourgeouis family<br />\nand can be appreciated by<br />\nanyone raised in almost any<br />\nkind of family. They draw on<br />\nordinary common experiences<br />\nof nearly all people when they<br />\nare forced in one way or<br />\nanother to live in close quarters<br />\nwith other poeple whom they<br />\ndo not choose. Being the father<br />\nof two girls, Nash was able to<br />\ntake much of his personal experience and translate it into his<br />\ntwisted verse.<br />\nSome of the most enjoyable<br />\npoems in the book have really<br />\nnothing to do with families at<br />\nall. They are short, strange<br />\npieces about animals. Nash is<br />\nprobably best remembered for<br />\npoems of this type. These arc<br />\nperhaps the most \"childish\"<br />\npoems in the book. But they are<br />\nalso the most readable and, for<br />\nthe most part, the funniest.<br />\nSome people, no doubt, see<br />\nin Nash's poetry only stupid,<br />\ncontrived rhymes which required no talent to create and<br />\nare hardly suitable for even<br />\nchildren's reading. Most of<br />\nNash's readers, however, find<br />\nhis poetry to be lively, insightful and funny. Family<br />\nReunion is not Nash's best;<br />\nsome of the poems are just a little too silly. On the whole,<br />\nthough, the book captures the<br />\nfoibles of families both accurately and with humor.<br />\n<br />\n\f,<br />\n<br />\n-=<br />\n<br />\nj5144::144`,4,1.<br />\nNEWS-LETTER/17<br />\n<br />\nScience<br />\nNew Research Shows Beer Drinking is Healthy<br />\nby Miriam Tucker<br />\n<br />\nthe<br />\nthe<br />\nnily<br />\nby<br />\nany<br />\non<br />\nices<br />\nhey<br />\nOr<br />\n<br />\nters<br />\nhey<br />\n.her<br />\nto<br />\nexhis<br />\n<br />\nible<br />\nally<br />\ns at<br />\nnge<br />\nh is<br />\nfor<br />\nare<br />\nsh\"<br />\nare<br />\nfor<br />\nt.<br />\nsee<br />\npid,<br />\nreand<br />\n,ven<br />\nof<br />\n'ind<br />\ninnily<br />\n,est;<br />\nI litole,<br />\nthe<br />\nac-<br />\n<br />\nA Canadian researcher has<br />\nrecently announced some intriguing news: people who<br />\ndrink beer regularly, and in<br />\nmoderate amounts, seem to be<br />\nhealthier than wine or liquor<br />\ndrinkers, or non-drinkers.<br />\nThese results come from data<br />\nincluded in the Canada Health<br />\nSurvey, which was conducted<br />\nto ascertain the basic health of<br />\nover 17,000 Canadians.<br />\nTypical questions in the<br />\nsurvery concerned numbers of<br />\ndoctor visits in the past year<br />\nand the number of work days<br />\nmissed. The survey also included questions about drinking<br />\nhabits and types of alcohol<br />\nconsumed. Dr. Alex Richman,<br />\nof Dalhousie University in<br />\nNova Scotia, studied the survey<br />\ndata that involved alcohol and<br />\nincidence of illness. He received funding from the<br />\nAlchoholic Beverage Medical<br />\nFoundation<br />\nResearch<br />\n(ABMRF), at the Johns<br />\nHopkins School of Medicine,<br />\nand from the Canadian and<br />\nU.S. Brewers Associations.<br />\nRichman looked at six different groups: people who had<br />\nstrong preferences for either<br />\nbeer, wine, or liquor, drinkers<br />\nwho gave no preference, nondrinkers, and people who<br />\ndidn't report their drinking<br />\nhabits. Only beer drinkers<br />\nshowed a significantly lower<br />\nrate of illness than expected.<br />\nSpecifically, beer drinkers were<br />\n13 percent less ill than average<br />\nfor a group of similar age, sex<br />\nand socioeconomic status.<br />\nWine drinkers were 2 percent<br />\nless ill than average, and liquor<br />\ndrinkers, 1 percent less.

For one, instead of beer<br />\npromoting good health, there<br />\nmay be a third factor promoting both beer drinking and<br />\ngood health. Researchers have<br />\nsuggested that the social interactions which occur in bars,<br />\nor in other situations in which<br />\nbeer is consumed, may encourage people to lead healthy<br />\nlifestyles. Also, beer advertising, which usually shows happy, healthy people drinking<br />\nbeer, may attract consumers<br />\nwho are already healthy. Or<br />\nconversely, the ads may encourage people to act in a<br />\nsimilar fashion.<br />\nA second factor is the<br />\npossibility of misrepresentation<br />\nin a survery. One group may<br />\ntend to understate their illness,<br />\nor to simply be mistaken in<br />\ntheir answers. Also, the group<br />\nthaf did not report their drinking habits may be significant.<br />\nSome may be heavy drinkers<br />\nwho chose to conceal their<br />\nhabit by not answering the<br />\nquestion. Further research is<br />\nneeded to rule out these<br />\npossibilities.<br />\nAs yet, therefore, doctors are<br />\nnot recommending beer as a<br />\ntreatment for heart disease.<br />\nAlthough it is widely agreed<br />\nthat moderate beer drinking<br />\nisn't harmful, the fact that one<br />\nin ten drinkers will eventually<br />\nbecome alcoholics is reason for<br />\ncaution. Some recent genetics<br />\nstudies, however, may lay that<br />\nconcern to rest.<br />\nDr. Donald W. Goodwin, of<br />\nthe ABMRF, is one of many<br />\nresearchers who has found<br />\nevidence that alcoholism may<br />\nbe hereditary. He was involved<br />\nin a twin study in Copenhagen<br />\nwhich revealed that biologic<br />\nsons of alcoholics, whether they<br />\nwere raised by their natural<br />\nparents, or by non-alcoholic<br />\nadoptive parents were four<br />\ntimes as likely to become<br />\nalcoholics as biologic sons of<br />\nnon-alcoholics. The ABMRF is<br />\nnow considering funding<br />\nresearch to identify genetic<br />\n\"markers,\" such as differences<br />\nin brain wave patterns, which<br />\nwould identify those individuals<br />\nwho are predisposed to<br />\nalcoholism. This would be extremely significant in leading to<br />\nboth prevention and cure of<br />\nalcoholism. If, then, such a<br />\nmarker were identified, and if<br />\nresearch proves that moderate<br />\nbeer drinking indeed raises the<br />\nlevel of beneficial cholesterol,<br />\nthen doctors may be able to<br />\nrecommend to patients at risk<br />\nfor CVD, but not alcoholism,<br />\nto drink a few beers a day as<br />\npreventitive medicine.<br />\nThis possibility, however, is<br />\nfar in the future. For right now,<br />\nthe consensus is that although<br />\nbeer drinking appears to be<br />\nbeneficial, nobody is advising<br />\nnon-drinkers to start drinking<br />\nbeer. If, however, you're<br />\npresently enjoying a few beers<br />\na day, and you're not pregnant<br />\nor planning on driving afterward, there's no reason to stop.<br />\n<br />\n\f18/FEBRUARY 7, 1986<br />\n<br />\nSports<br />\nDoherty Still In Hunt For Winning Season<br />\n<br />\nJays Take Nap In Losses To Widener, Ursinus<br />\nby Craig Brooks<br />\nAll that is left is pride.<br />\nThe men's varsity hoops<br />\nteam is now 8-12 and all that remains with four games left in<br />\nthe season is pride. . .the pride<br />\nof reaching a .500 season.. .the<br />\npride of upsetting Widener<br />\ntomorrow night at home...the<br />\npride of beating league-leading<br />\nWashington College in the<br />\nseason finale.

For<br />\nthe next four years, the parents<br />\nwill go to a nodding association, and the coach will become<br />\ndictatorial. So right up front,<br />\nthere are a lot of things that<br />\nmust be determined by this 17<br />\nyear-old keeper who still has<br />\nacne, and by the parents along<br />\nwith the high school coach,<br />\nwho normally can only stop a<br />\nballplayer from going to a particular school, but for some<br />\nreason never can convince him<br />\nto go to one. It's that tentative<br />\ntime when the kid thinks his<br />\nhorizons are unlimited, that the<br />\ntree is loaded with more apples<br />\nthan he can possibly eat, and<br />\nwhen the college staff spends<br />\ntime with the high school coach<br />\nafter his games, moving the salt<br />\nand pepper shakers over a beer<br />\nto make him feel important.<br />\nEnough. Let's get down to<br />\nthe nitty-gritty, what the high<br />\nschool blue chipper, the prospective college aircraft carrier<br />\nto be, should be looking for<br />\nwhen the coaches come looking<br />\nfor him.<br />\nFirst of all, how far does he<br />\nwant to travel? Does he want to<br />\nget away, or does he want to be<br />\nsure that his family and high<br />\nschool chums will be able to see<br />\nhim play?<br />\nI think a ballplayer should<br />\npretty much stick to the type of<br />\nenvironment he was brought up<br />\nin. If he's city-oriented, then<br />\nL.A., Chi-Town, Atlanta or<br />\n<br />\n#44Ae<br />\nDallas is fine. But when you<br />\nstart talking Pullman, Oregon,<br />\nProvo or Butte, or someplace<br />\nlike Idaho, things could be difficult for a kid used to concrete<br />\ncurbs, subways and L's, and<br />\nthe bustle of the Big Apple<br />\nlifestyle.<br />\nConversely, the choice can be<br />\ndifficult for the rural, or suburban kid. He should look toward<br />\nthe lowas or Nebraskas, or the<br />\nChapel Hills, where trees bud in<br />\nthe spring, the grass is green,<br />\nthere are no smokestacks and<br />\ntractors are common.<br />\nWeather also comes into it.<br />\nIf you're a snowbird, then<br />\nthere's an advantage in not going to the bayou area, and viceversa. A kid used to surfboards<br />\nand dune buggies won't adapt<br />\nwell to Ann Arbor, Michigan.<br />\nThat's why I firmly believe that<br />\na player has got to stay within<br />\nhis accustomed environment. If<br />\nyou're an all-city player from<br />\nBoston, Massachusetts, for example, I doubt the University<br />\nof Texas fits.<br />\nA second point: What type<br />\nof education is the high school<br />\nplayer looking for? Obviously,<br />\nif he wants to major in deep sea<br />\ndiving, then the University of<br />\nUtah just doesn't have the<br />\nqualifications. On the other<br />\nhand, if he wants hotel management, then Cornell or the<br />\nUniv. of Nevada\u2014Las Vegas<br />\n<br />\nVegas would light up the<br />\nscoreboard. See what I mean?<br />\nThe third thing a youngster<br />\nshould look at is the style of<br />\nplay of the school and its<br />\ncoach. If our blue chipper is a<br />\nplayground<br />\none-on-one,<br />\nblacktop player, who is transition oriented and an open court<br />\nplayer, then Indiana or<br />\nPrinceton is a no-no. And, if<br />\nhe's a power-type, down-low<br />\nplayer who's physical, very<br />\nblack and blue oriented, then<br />\nhe should go to a school where<br />\nthey play a slow, Fred Waringtype tempo, and walk with the<br />\nball. Not to UCLA,Las Vegas,<br />\nor Kentucky.<br />\nA fourth point to consider is<br />\nexposure. If the player wants<br />\nnational exposure and TV<br />\npackages, then he has to look<br />\nfor universities in the first two<br />\ntime zones, Eastern and Central, which are located in<br />\npopulation centers, places<br />\nwhich have the greater number<br />\nof NBA clubs and also the TV<br />\nexposure. That's to be found in<br />\nconferences like the Big East,<br />\nACC and the Big Ten, where<br />\nconference matchups make the<br />\nneedle on the Neilson Ratings<br />\njump.<br />\nNow, we get to the most important thing.

Over<br />\nthe long run, we may be able to<br />\nraise [them].\"<br />\nA Sigma Phi Epsilon<br />\nmember at Hopkins noted, \"a<br />\nlot of Goucher's attraction is<br />\nthat they're a women's school,<br />\nand once they lose that, they'll<br />\nbe another mediocre, small<br />\nschool.\"<br />\nDismissing this charge, Phair<br />\nsaid that if the college can<br />\nbecome coeducational in a way<br />\nthat \"preserves the primary<br />\ncharacteristics of a single sex institution, which are a sex-free<br />\ncurriculum, role models and<br />\nleadership opportunities, then it<br />\nseems to me it would only gain.<br />\n\"We will need to beef up<br />\nsome of our academic programs, facilities, internships,\"<br />\ncontinued Phair. \"And we may<br />\nwell make changes in the area<br />\nof sports.

Most students<br />\nignore the (few) classes offered, and<br />\ndon't even return to campus until late<br />\nJanuary. That's a pity\u2014Intersession<br />\ncould be (and supposedly once was) the<br />\nmost interesting and fun part of the year.<br />\nAnd while there has been a lot of talk<br />\nthe last few years about improving Intersession, little has been done.<br />\nDean of the School of Arts and<br />\nSciences George Fisher claims Intersession is making a comeback. There has<br />\nbeen some \"movement\" towards improving it, he says. He has, for example,<br />\nstatistics showing that more Homewood<br />\nstudents took Intersession courses this<br />\nyear than ever before.<br />\nBut we have statistics showing that<br />\nthere were no engineering courses during Intersession this year. And even in<br />\nthe School of Arts and Sciences, what<br />\ncourses were offered were of extremely<br />\nlimited interest. Most were small, upperlevel seminars open only to upperclassmen in their own departments.<br />\nSo what is to be done about Intersession? Mark Komisky offers his own<br />\nprescriptions elsewhere on this page. As<br />\nfor the administration, Fisher's baby just<br />\nnow is the idea of intensive language<br />\ncourses. Such a course (in Korean) was<br />\nsuccessfully held this year, he says, and<br />\nplans are in the works for further attempts this summer. If that experiment<br />\nproves successful, Fisher envisions future<br />\nIntersessions in which highly-intensive<br />\nlanguage courses will be widely available.<br />\nThere certainly would be nothing<br />\nwrong with such a situation but neither<br />\nwould it be sufficient. So we have a far<br />\nmore radical proposal: require new<br />\nfaculty members to periodically teach Intersession courses.<br /><br />\nTraditionally, the problem with Intersession has been that faculty members<br />\nhardly ever teach. They don't get paid,<br />\nso there is no financial incentive, and<br />\nyounger professors often claim they need<br />\nthe time for research if they are to get<br />\ntenure. The equally traditional method<br />\nproposed for improving the term is to<br />\npay faculty members to teach, which was<br />\nalways rejected on financial grounds.<br />\nBut our program wouldn't cost a<br />\ndime. Merely make teaching an Intersession course periodically\u2014say every three<br />\nor four years\u2014a part of faculty<br />\nmembers'jobs. Obviously, this couldn't<br />\nbe hoisted on people who are already<br />\nhere without paying them more, so we<br />\nsuggest a 'grandfather clause.' Whenever<br />\na new faculty member is hired, make Intersession teaching a requirement.<br />\nWithin a few years, there would be a<br />\nwide variety of Intersession courses, and<br />\nit's hard to imagine that the prospect of<br />\nteaching an additional three-week course<br />\nevery four years would be so heinous a<br />\nburden as to discourage first-rate young<br />\nscholars from coming to Hopkins.<br />\nFisher says he is \"reluctant\" to \"set<br />\nup two separate classes of faculty<br />\nmembers.\" Oh, and why is that? Aren't<br />\nthere already three separate classes of<br />\nfaculty members? And surely Fisher is<br />\naware that there are faculty members<br />\nwith special perks: secretaries, light<br />\nteaching loads, etc. One guy even has his<br />\nown department. Will one more \"class\"<br />\nbe so horrible?<br />\nWe suspect our program doesn't have<br />\na chance of being adopted, but that is<br />\nhardly an argument against it. If Intersession is to be improved, dramatic<br />\nchanges\u2014not timid and traditional<br />\nmodifications\u2014will be needed.<br /><br />\nApartheid and Investments<br />\nFew issues have generated more controversy recently than Hopkins' South<br />\nAfrican investments. The matter came to<br />\na head during Intersession, when Bishop<br />\nTutu's visit publicized the University's<br />\nrelationship with South Africa.<br />\nBut while many student groups have<br />\njumped on the bandwagon and endorsed the idea of total divestment, we have<br />\nyet to comment on the issue. It is time<br />\n\\-\\that silence ended: the University ought<br />\nto divest itself of its South African<br />\ninvestments.<br />\nMorally, the issue is a simple one. No<br />\nintelligent person can possibly support<br />\nthe South African regime. And insofar<br />\nas the government's policies are morally repugnant, it seems difficult to justify<br />\nprofiting from investments which sup\u2022<br />\nport it.<br />\nBut on a pragmal: :2.vei, the issw.. is<br />\nto divest<br />\nfar more complex.

There is<br />\nsubstantial evidence that many American<br />\ncompanies operating there would assist<br />\nthe government in a time of crisis\u2014an<br />\nindefensible position. Indeed, if there is<br />\none thing which is conclusive in our decision to advocate divestment\u2014it is this.<br />\nAnd as divestment advocates have correctly pointed out, the Trustees' recent<br />\ndecision to divest from companies which<br />\nhave not signed the Sullivan Principles<br />\neffectively refutes the argument that such<br />\ncompanies can be a force for good.

While this may or<br />\nmay not be so, it is undoubtedly the belief.\"<br />\nThe previous two paragraphs<br />\nare a direct quote from a report<br />\nprepared by the Committee on<br />\nUndergraduate Studies, a stucommittee<br />\ndent/faculty<br />\norganized to propose changes<br />\nin academic policy. At the time<br />\nthe report was written it was<br />\ndetermined that Intersession<br />\nhad been on a continual decline<br />\nfor the past several years and<br />\nthat roughly fifteen percent of<br />\nthe student body took part in it.<br />\nOf this 15 percent, it was also<br />\ndetermined that over half were<br />\nengaged in independent study<br />\nand for-credit research.<br />\nThe report, of which I was<br />\none of the authors, suggested<br />\nseveral improvements for Intersession.

Such a course<br />\ncould still be quite good if the<br />\nspeakers were chosen properly,<br />\nbut the fields of expertise of<br />\nmost of our speakers had<br />\nnothing to do with nonviolence.<br />\nFor example, we spent four<br />\nweeks listening to lectures on<br />\ndifferent aspects of nuclear<br />\nwar; we learned all about wartime economics, nuclear winter,<br />\nand the Strategic Defense Initiative.

Wickwire wanted us to<br />\nknow that his course was no<br />\ngut, so he gave low grades on<br />\nthe midterm; of course, by then<br />\nit was too late to drop the<br />\ncourse. Furthermore, there<br />\nwere no comments anywhere<br />\non my midterm; there was just<br />\na grade.

Cinemas: Down and Out at Harbor Place<br />\nDown and Out in Beverly Hills<br />\nDir. Paul Mazursky.<br />\nRichard Dreyfuss, Bette<br />\nMidler, Nick Nolte<br />\nby Laurah Limbrick<br />\nI caught this picture at the<br />\nnew UA film conplex down by<br />\nthe Inner Harbor, and I saw<br />\nsomething there that disturbed<br />\nme greatly. I'm talking about<br />\nthe hideous lava lamp blobs<br />\nthat the management insists on<br />\nshowing before each film. The<br />\nblobs look like mutant<br />\namoebas, and for over fifteen<br />\nminutes they floated and oozed<br />\nover the screen to the accompaniment of Willie Nelson. Unfortunately, the movie was only slightly better than the blobs.<br />\nThis film starts out on a pro-<br /><br />\nmising premise: what happens<br />\nwhen a destitute bum (Nick<br />\nNolte) invades the lives of the<br />\nnouveau riche Whiteman family? However, it fails to live up<br />\nto this intriguing idea.<br />\nRichard Dreyfuss is Dave<br />\nWhiteman, a clothing-hanger<br />\nmagnate who saves the life of<br />\nJerry (Nolte) when he tries to<br />\ndrown himself in the swimming<br />\npool of the Whiteman estate.<br />\nWhiteman has been undergoing<br />\nbourgeousie ennui; he's lost interest in his wife (Bette Midler),<br />\nhe can't communicate with his<br />\nson (Evan Richards), his<br />\ndaughter (Tracy Nelson) is a<br />\nborderline anorexic, and he's<br />\nhaving an affair with Carmen,<br />\nthe maid (Elizabeth Pena).<br />\nSo in a show of generosity,<br />\nhe takes Jerry under his wing<br /><br />\nHopkins' Very Own<br />\nString Quartet<br />\nby Jay Lechtman<br />\nThose of you lucky enough<br />\nto be doing your laundry last<br />\nSunday afternoon in the basement of AMR II would have<br />\nbeen serenaded by the university's newest music sensation,<br />\nthe Hopkins String Quartet.<br />\nThe quartet was organized by<br />\nfreshman Susan Stolovy<br />\nbecause \"I always loved playing chamber music, so I decided<br />\neven before I came here that I<br />\nwould form a group if one<br />\nwasn't already established.\"<br />\nThe group regularly plays in the<br />\nbasement practice rooms.<br />\nThe quartet, the only<br />\norganized university chamber<br />\nstring ensemble, consists of<br />\nStolovy on first violin,<br />\nfreshman Lucy Wilson on second violin, freshman Matt<br />\nWyant on cello, and University of Delaware graduate and<br />\nWestinghouse employee Paul<br />\nNelson on viola. Stolovy,<br />\nWilson, and Nelson, all<br />\nmembers of the Hopkins Symphony Orchestra, played exten-<br /><br />\nsively at state and regional<br />\nlevels before coming to<br />\nHopkins, and cellist Wyant performed in the Georgia All-State<br />\nOrchestra and the Atlanta<br />\nYouth Symphony before playing here. In addition, Wilson,<br />\nStolovy and Wyant are currently studying privately at the<br />\nPeabody Conservatory of<br />\nMusic.<br />\nThe group, which rehearses<br />\nextremely diligently for one<br />\nwhose primary purpose is \"to<br />\nhave fun,\" accomplishes that as<br />\nwell, joking between pieces,<br />\nand adapting music for their<br />\nenjoyment. \"Playing in a<br />\nquartet is more than in an orchestra,\" said Stolovy,<br />\n\"because of the close communication between each<br />\nmember.\"<br />\n\"Each person is important,\"<br />\nadded Wilson.<br />\nThe quartet will be performing in the Garrett Room of the<br />\nMSE Library, at 7:30 p.m. on<br />\nMarch 15, playing selections<br />\nfrom Schubert's Quartet in G<br />\nMinor,<br />\nand<br />\nDvorak's<br />\n\"American\" Quartet.<br /><br />\nThe Latest Crop<br />\nof Albee Plays<br />\nby Jason Hanson<br />\n\"6 Plays\" read the program<br />\nI was handed at the door.<br />\nBelow that was printed \"under<br />\nthe supervision of Edward<br />\nAlbee.\" Delighted to be present<br />\nat theater under the auspices of<br />\nso eminent a playwright as<br />\nAlbee, I eagerly took my seat<br />\nfor the most recent presentation<br />\nof one-act plays written by<br />\nstudents of the Writing<br />\nSeminars department.<br />\nMy mood, however, was<br />\nsoon deflated when Edward<br />\nAlbee himself appeared on<br />\nstage to announce his connection with the productions. He<br /><br />\ngave much due credit to the<br />\nplaywrights and directors of the<br />\nevening's dramas and to professor Robert Arellano, the<br />\ndriving force behind student<br />\ntheater at Johns Hopkins. But<br />\nAlbee could not take credit for<br />\nmuch direction except when<br />\nstudents specifically consulted<br />\nhim or when he felt that a scene<br />\nobviously needed rewriting.<br />\nDespite this lack of strong<br />\nprofessional guidance, though,<br />\nthe productions came off quite<br />\nwell.<br />\nAt the head of the program<br />\nwas Jay/Alfred written by<br />\nDavid Charles and directed by<br />\nContinued on Page 14<br /><br />\nand tries to rehabilitate him. Instead of gratitude, however,<br />\nJerry displays hostility, which<br />\nonly intrigues Dave more. So<br />\nJerry is invited to stay in the<br />\nWhiteman home indefinitely,<br />\nthus setting the stage for what<br />\nshould be an uproarious clash<br />\nof customs and ideas, but<br />\nwhich fails to deliver.<br />\nThe first enemy Jerry makes<br />\nis Mrs. Whiteman, who regards<br />\nhim with disgust and open<br />\nhostility. Bette Midler does a<br />\nfine job in her role as the<br />\nstereotypical JAP housewife<br />\nwho is gradually won over by<br />\nJerry's charm. We aren't asked<br />\nto pity Jerry, rather, he is a<br />\nman of mystery, who comes into a situation and changes the<br />\nlives of everyone and then he's<br />\ngone. And Mrs. Whiteman cer-<br /><br />\ntainly doesn't feel any sympathy towards Jerry in the<br />\nbeginning; \"That bum is not<br />\nstaying in my house!\" she<br />\nscreeches when Dave tells her<br />\nthat Jerry will be hanging<br />\naround for a while. However,<br />\nshe, as well as the rest of the<br />\nfamily, is touched by Jerry as<br />\nthe story goes on.<br />\nJust when everyone else is<br />\nbeginning to really like Jerry,<br />\nthough, Dave finds that Jerry<br />\nis starting to get on his nerves.<br />\nHe becomes disillusioned with<br />\nthe charismatic drifter when he<br />\nrealizes that Jerry is taking over<br />\ntheir lives; this provides the<br />\nfunniest moments in the film.<br />\nDave is at odds with the rest of<br />\nhis family, and the positions are<br />\nnow reversed; he wants Jerry<br />\nout, but they want him to stay.<br /><br />\nIn the end, it's all tied up a bit<br />\ntoo neatly to leave the viewer<br />\nsatisfied.<br />\nWhat makes this film not as<br />\nbad as it could have been,<br />\nthough, are the fine performances by Nolte, Dreyfuss,<br />\nMidler, and Little Richard as a<br />\nrecord producer and Beverly<br />\nHills<br />\nundesirable.<br />\nThe<br />\nWhiteman family dog, Matisse,<br />\nnearly steals the show. Strong<br />\nportrayals, no matter how bad<br />\nthe material, kept this picture<br />\nfrom being a total flop. The<br />\nideas behind Down and Out in<br />\nBeverly Hills must have seemed<br />\nquite funny on paper.<br />\nHowever, the director's execution of the script didn't come<br />\noff quite as well as it could<br />\nhave.<br /><br />\nArts Calendar!<br />\nMOVIES:<br />\nSenior Class Film Series:<br />\nThe Spy Who Loved Me and<br />\nLive and Let Die.

Jay, an optimist of<br />\nsorts, molds reality to conform<br />\nto his rosy view of the duo's<br />\nmeager situation. Alfred insists<br />\nthat the truth conforms to a less<br />\ncheerful reality. The interplay<br />\nbetween the two actors was<br />\nlimited by the writing of the<br />\nplay but was adequate enough<br />\nto convey that the two were<br />\nmerely components of one<br />\npersonality.<br />\nAll Souls Day, written by<br />\nJames Boylan and directed by<br />\nHerman Ayayo, explored the<br />\nattempts of a pious widower<br />\nand a runaway girl to communicate with loved ones lost<br />\nor far away. It also raised some<br />\nserious questions about the<br />\nnature of our beliefs. The<br />\ndialogue suggested that the girl<br />\nwas the spirit of the man's<br />\ndaughter who had been lost in<br />\ninfancy, but this identity, as the<br />\nman's \"problem\" was not<br /><br />\nmurder of a Lousiana woman.<br />\nIts straightforward presentation, assisted by a convincing<br />\nperformance of the woman's<br />\nmurder by Peter Piccinini, gave<br />\na painfully honest treatment of<br />\nthis discomforting subject.<br />\nA Process ofInspiration, the<br />\npresentation's final play, written by Herman Ayayo and<br />\ndirected by Robbie Simon, offered comic relief and some of<br />\nthe finest acting of the evening.<br />\nStrong performances by Jim<br />\nSullivan as a writer who has run<br />\nout of ideas and by Marc<br />\nSalevitz as his flitting,<br />\nhomosexual publisher enlivened<br />\na substantial script. The play<br />\nwas among the best written of<br />\nthe six, even though its ending<br />\nleft a few too many questions<br />\nunanswered.<br />\nOn the whole, the six plays<br />\nrepresented a decent attempt to<br />\nproduce student written plays<br />\nwith student actors on stage at<br />\nJohns Hopkins.

He says, \"They have to<br />\nexist by themselves, to justify<br />\nthemselves without any indication of what is happening,<br />\nwithout any image, without any<br />\nface, without any countryside,<br />\nwithout a tear, without a<br />\nsilence.. .Incredulous, I read<br />\nand reread this naked and<br />\nbloodless text.

When [I] first came here<br />\nin 1944, you couldn't guess<br />\nwhat had happened here, that<br />\nthese trees hid the secret of a<br />\ndeath camp.\"<br />\nMost often, though, Lanzmann is direct\u2014he asks the<br />\npeople he is interviewing to be<br />\nexact, to remember in detail, to<br />\nsay what they have to say<br />\nbecause it is their duty and<br />\nright. He will ask bluntly, \"Are<br />\nPolish women glad there are no<br />\nJewesses left?\" or \"How did it<br />\nlook, the gas chamber. Can you<br />\ndescribe it precisely?\" or \"So<br />\nit was (you) who dug up and<br />\nburned all the Jews of Vilna?\"<br />\nThroughout the text, certain<br />\nimages and themes recur and<br />\nreinforce themselves, a repetition that is deliberately<br />\nshocking\u2014the mass graves, the<br />\ntrains that brought the Jews<br />\n(sometimes ignorant of their<br />\ndestination) to the death camps,<br />\nthe disbelief and horror of<br />\nthose involved to what was happening, the gas chambers, the<br /><br />\nNazi drive to make the camps<br />\nmore \"efficient,\" and the pain<br />\nof those who watched their<br />\nfriends and family die in the<br />\ncamps while they were unable<br />\nto help.<br />\nIn one segment, a barber<br />\nwho, along with numerous<br />\nother professional barbers, was<br />\nrecruited by the Germans to cut<br />\nthe hair of the women as they<br />\nentered the gas chamber of<br />\nTreblinka, describes what happened when the wife and sister<br />\nof one of his colleagues walked<br />\ninto the chamber:<br />\n\"They tried to talk to him<br />\nand the husband of his sister.<br />\nThey [the men] could not tell<br />\nthem this was the last time they<br />\n[would be] alive, because behind<br />\nthem was the Nazis.

First published in 1950,<br />\nit has now been reissued by Little, Brown &amp; Company. The<br />\npoems in it were taken from<br />\nand<br />\ncollections<br />\nearlier<br />\nmagazines in which Nash<br />\npublished. As its title suggests,<br />\nthe general theme of the book<br />\nis family life. None of the<br />\npoems in it is to be taken<br />\nseriously. They range from<br />\npatently silly to brilliantly funny. And every one of them may<br />\nin some way be described as<br />\nstrange.<br />\nMany critics refuse to ascribe<br />\nthe description \"poetry\" to<br />\nNash's work at all, preferring<br />\ninstead words like \"light verse\"<br />\nand \"humorous rhyme.\" In<br />\nfact, Nash himself seems only<br />\nto have to called his work<br />\n\"verse.\" Nevertheless, such a<br />\ndescription hardly seems adequate to describe some of the<br />\nmost ingenious rhyme and<br />\nwordplay ever constructed in<br />\nEnglish to delight its readers.<br />\nNash was prolific. His<br />\npublished poems on all subjects<br />\nnumber in the thousands. After<br /><br />\nspending a year at Harvard, he<br />\nended up contributing regularly to The New Yorker and<br />\nworking on the young magazine's editorial staff helping<br />\nestablish its sophisticated tone.<br />\nLike E.B. White, his command<br />\nof the language was tremendous and he was often at his<br />\nbest writing for children. He<br />\nlived in Baltimore until he died<br />\nin 1972.<br />\nFamily Reunion is not a<br />\nchildren's book; but it comes<br />\nclose. Almost every poem<br />\nwould be understandable to a<br />\nchild. The topic of each could<br />\nnot be more mundane. But the<br />\nfantastic thing about his poems<br />\nis that he takes such ordinary<br />\nthings and talks about them in<br />\nsuch simple ways and in spite<br />\nof, or because of this, his<br />\npoetry remains engaging, a<br />\ndelight to read.<br />\nNash's style is unique. Many<br />\nhave tried to imitate him but all<br />\nhave failed. He wrote with a<br />\ncombination of bizzare rhyme<br />\nand untamed meter. He distorts<br />\nwords and phrases to bring<br />\nthem together in the most<br />\nunlikely rhymes. The first line<br />\nof a typical rhyming couplet<br />\nmay be three syllables while the<br />\nsecond may extend for a<br />\nparagraph. All of this makes<br />\nfor very colorful, if unconventional, verse.<br />\nThe topics that Nash chose<br />\nfor the poems in this book are<br /><br />\nthe most ordinary happenings<br />\nin typical upper-middle-class<br />\nfamilies. As Nash wrote in his<br />\nforeward, \"I have been a<br />\nmember of one family or<br />\nanother all my life. I think<br />\nfamilies are interesting. Only in<br />\nthe family do we find the battle between the sexes raging<br />\nconcurrently with the battle between the generations. It<br />\nfascinates me to note the<br />\nvarious ways in which a husband can please or infuriate a<br />\nwife and a wife can baffle or<br />\nbutter up a husband; I follow<br />\nwith delight the vacillations of<br />\nboth between pride and despair<br />\nwhen facing their young; and I<br />\ncan sympathize with if not approve the attempts of the young<br />\nto muscle in on such adult<br />\nmonopolies as interrupting,<br />\ntalking back, staying up late,<br />\nand evading the issue.\"<br />\nMost of the poems here are<br />\nnot weighed down by the period<br />\nin which they were written; but<br />\nsome are definitely products of<br />\ntheir times, portrayals of the<br />\nideal WASP family. Reading<br />\nthese is like watching June and<br />\nWard Cleaver trying to raise<br />\nWally and the Beav. But even<br />\nfor readers who were not raised<br />\nin such a family, they can be<br />\nvery amusing, both for their<br />\nstereotypical images and for the<br />\ninimitable style in which they<br />\nare written.<br />\nMost of the poems in the<br /><br />\nbook, however, go beyond the<br />\nnarrow confines of the<br />\nAmerican bourgeouis family<br />\nand can be appreciated by<br />\nanyone raised in almost any<br />\nkind of family. They draw on<br />\nordinary common experiences<br />\nof nearly all people when they<br />\nare forced in one way or<br />\nanother to live in close quarters<br />\nwith other poeple whom they<br />\ndo not choose. Being the father<br />\nof two girls, Nash was able to<br />\ntake much of his personal experience and translate it into his<br />\ntwisted verse.<br />\nSome of the most enjoyable<br />\npoems in the book have really<br />\nnothing to do with families at<br />\nall. They are short, strange<br />\npieces about animals. Nash is<br />\nprobably best remembered for<br />\npoems of this type. These arc<br />\nperhaps the most \"childish\"<br />\npoems in the book. But they are<br />\nalso the most readable and, for<br />\nthe most part, the funniest.<br />\nSome people, no doubt, see<br />\nin Nash's poetry only stupid,<br />\ncontrived rhymes which required no talent to create and<br />\nare hardly suitable for even<br />\nchildren's reading. Most of<br />\nNash's readers, however, find<br />\nhis poetry to be lively, insightful and funny. Family<br />\nReunion is not Nash's best;<br />\nsome of the poems are just a little too silly. On the whole,<br />\nthough, the book captures the<br />\nfoibles of families both accurately and with humor.<br /><br />\n,<br /><br />\n-=<br /><br />\nj5144::144`,4,1.<br />\nNEWS-LETTER/17<br /><br />\nScience<br />\nNew Research Shows Beer Drinking is Healthy<br />\nby Miriam Tucker<br /><br />\nthe<br />\nthe<br />\nnily<br />\nby<br />\nany<br />\non<br />\nices<br />\nhey<br />\nOr<br /><br />\nters<br />\nhey<br />\n.her<br />\nto<br />\nexhis<br /><br />\nible<br />\nally<br />\ns at<br />\nnge<br />\nh is<br />\nfor<br />\nare<br />\nsh\"<br />\nare<br />\nfor<br />\nt.<br />\nsee<br />\npid,<br />\nreand<br />\n,ven<br />\nof<br />\n'ind<br />\ninnily<br />\n,est;<br />\nI litole,<br />\nthe<br />\nac-<br /><br />\nA Canadian researcher has<br />\nrecently announced some intriguing news: people who<br />\ndrink beer regularly, and in<br />\nmoderate amounts, seem to be<br />\nhealthier than wine or liquor<br />\ndrinkers, or non-drinkers.<br />\nThese results come from data<br />\nincluded in the Canada Health<br />\nSurvey, which was conducted<br />\nto ascertain the basic health of<br />\nover 17,000 Canadians.<br />\nTypical questions in the<br />\nsurvery concerned numbers of<br />\ndoctor visits in the past year<br />\nand the number of work days<br />\nmissed. The survey also included questions about drinking<br />\nhabits and types of alcohol<br />\nconsumed. Dr. Alex Richman,<br />\nof Dalhousie University in<br />\nNova Scotia, studied the survey<br />\ndata that involved alcohol and<br />\nincidence of illness. He received funding from the<br />\nAlchoholic Beverage Medical<br />\nFoundation<br />\nResearch<br />\n(ABMRF), at the Johns<br />\nHopkins School of Medicine,<br />\nand from the Canadian and<br />\nU.S. Brewers Associations.<br />\nRichman looked at six different groups: people who had<br />\nstrong preferences for either<br />\nbeer, wine, or liquor, drinkers<br />\nwho gave no preference, nondrinkers, and people who<br />\ndidn't report their drinking<br />\nhabits. Only beer drinkers<br />\nshowed a significantly lower<br />\nrate of illness than expected.<br />\nSpecifically, beer drinkers were<br />\n13 percent less ill than average<br />\nfor a group of similar age, sex<br />\nand socioeconomic status.<br />\nWine drinkers were 2 percent<br />\nless ill than average, and liquor<br />\ndrinkers, 1 percent less. The<br />\ndrinkers of various types of<br />\nalcohol, the non-drinkers, and<br />\nthose who didn't report their_<br />\ndrinking habits all showed<br />\nslightly higher rates of illness.<br />\nThe only stastistically significant difference, however, was<br />\nfor that of beer drinkers.<br />\n\u2022 Questions concerning frequency and quantity of beer<br />\ndrinking showed that up to a<br /><br />\nNOP<br /><br />\nBob and Doug MacKenzie.

For one, instead of beer<br />\npromoting good health, there<br />\nmay be a third factor promoting both beer drinking and<br />\ngood health. Researchers have<br />\nsuggested that the social interactions which occur in bars,<br />\nor in other situations in which<br />\nbeer is consumed, may encourage people to lead healthy<br />\nlifestyles. Also, beer advertising, which usually shows happy, healthy people drinking<br />\nbeer, may attract consumers<br />\nwho are already healthy. Or<br />\nconversely, the ads may encourage people to act in a<br />\nsimilar fashion.<br />\nA second factor is the<br />\npossibility of misrepresentation<br />\nin a survery.

Some recent genetics<br />\nstudies, however, may lay that<br />\nconcern to rest.<br />\nDr. Donald W. Goodwin, of<br />\nthe ABMRF, is one of many<br />\nresearchers who has found<br />\nevidence that alcoholism may<br />\nbe hereditary. He was involved<br />\nin a twin study in Copenhagen<br />\nwhich revealed that biologic<br />\nsons of alcoholics, whether they<br />\nwere raised by their natural<br />\nparents, or by non-alcoholic<br />\nadoptive parents were four<br />\ntimes as likely to become<br />\nalcoholics as biologic sons of<br />\nnon-alcoholics. The ABMRF is<br />\nnow considering funding<br />\nresearch to identify genetic<br />\n\"markers,\" such as differences<br />\nin brain wave patterns, which<br />\nwould identify those individuals<br />\nwho are predisposed to<br />\nalcoholism. This would be extremely significant in leading to<br />\nboth prevention and cure of<br />\nalcoholism. If, then, such a<br />\nmarker were identified, and if<br />\nresearch proves that moderate<br />\nbeer drinking indeed raises the<br />\nlevel of beneficial cholesterol,<br />\nthen doctors may be able to<br />\nrecommend to patients at risk<br />\nfor CVD, but not alcoholism,<br />\nto drink a few beers a day as<br />\npreventitive medicine.<br />\nThis possibility, however, is<br />\nfar in the future. For right now,<br />\nthe consensus is that although<br />\nbeer drinking appears to be<br />\nbeneficial, nobody is advising<br />\nnon-drinkers to start drinking<br />\nbeer.

For<br />\nthe next four years, the parents<br />\nwill go to a nodding association, and the coach will become<br />\ndictatorial. So right up front,<br />\nthere are a lot of things that<br />\nmust be determined by this 17<br />\nyear-old keeper who still has<br />\nacne, and by the parents along<br />\nwith the high school coach,<br />\nwho normally can only stop a<br />\nballplayer from going to a particular school, but for some<br />\nreason never can convince him<br />\nto go to one. It's that tentative<br />\ntime when the kid thinks his<br />\nhorizons are unlimited, that the<br />\ntree is loaded with more apples<br />\nthan he can possibly eat, and<br />\nwhen the college staff spends<br />\ntime with the high school coach<br />\nafter his games, moving the salt<br />\nand pepper shakers over a beer<br />\nto make him feel important.<br />\nEnough. Let's get down to<br />\nthe nitty-gritty, what the high<br />\nschool blue chipper, the prospective college aircraft carrier<br />\nto be, should be looking for<br />\nwhen the coaches come looking<br />\nfor him.<br />\nFirst of all, how far does he<br />\nwant to travel? Does he want to<br />\nget away, or does he want to be<br />\nsure that his family and high<br />\nschool chums will be able to see<br />\nhim play?<br />\nI think a ballplayer should<br />\npretty much stick to the type of<br />\nenvironment he was brought up<br />\nin. If he's city-oriented, then<br />\nL.A., Chi-Town, Atlanta or<br /><br />\n#44Ae<br />\nDallas is fine. But when you<br />\nstart talking Pullman, Oregon,<br />\nProvo or Butte, or someplace<br />\nlike Idaho, things could be difficult for a kid used to concrete<br />\ncurbs, subways and L's, and<br />\nthe bustle of the Big Apple<br />\nlifestyle.<br />\nConversely, the choice can be<br />\ndifficult for the rural, or suburban kid. He should look toward<br />\nthe lowas or Nebraskas, or the<br />\nChapel Hills, where trees bud in<br />\nthe spring, the grass is green,<br />\nthere are no smokestacks and<br />\ntractors are common.<br />\nWeather also comes into it.<br />\nIf you're a snowbird, then<br />\nthere's an advantage in not going to the bayou area, and viceversa. A kid used to surfboards<br />\nand dune buggies won't adapt<br />\nwell to Ann Arbor, Michigan.<br />\nThat's why I firmly believe that<br />\na player has got to stay within<br />\nhis accustomed environment. If<br />\nyou're an all-city player from<br />\nBoston, Massachusetts, for example, I doubt the University<br />\nof Texas fits.<br />\nA second point: What type<br />\nof education is the high school<br />\nplayer looking for? Obviously,<br />\nif he wants to major in deep sea<br />\ndiving, then the University of<br />\nUtah just doesn't have the<br />\nqualifications.
