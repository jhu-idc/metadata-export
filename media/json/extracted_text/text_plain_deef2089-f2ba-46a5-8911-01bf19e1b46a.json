But I come<br />\nfrom a state where, to the best of my<br />\nknowledge (my inquiries have had to be<br />\nvery discreet), no college or university has<br />\na homophile organization. One of my<br />\nClose friends boasts of how he \"beat up a<br />\nfaggot\"; effeminacy is highly suspect; and<br />\n.13ne is taught to conform to that mythic<br />\nImage of the all-American male.<br />\nHomosexuality is a valid ground for<br />\nostracism or social persecution, and a gay<br />\nhas absolutely nowhere to go for help.<br />\nIn contrast to the atmosphere of the<br />\nsmall city in which I grew up, Hopkins is<br />\nliberal beyond my most hopeful dreams. I<br />\ndon't like to think of what would happen<br />\nIf someone attempted to start a<br />\nhomophile organization on the campus in<br />\nMY hometown. At the very least, the<br />\nPolice would be called in to break up the<br />\nfirst meeting; at the very worst, they<br />\nOught not be called in to break up a near<br />\nlYnching of \"perverts.\"<br />\nMy hopes of living a reasonable,<br />\nout-of-the-closet life were encouraged<br />\nWhen I came to Hopkins. Only a month<br />\nafter my freshman year began, I saw<br />\nadvertisements for the formation of the<br />\nGaY Caucus. Accustomed to thinking that<br />\nsuch things simply weren't done, I was<br />\nboth a little bit shocked and elated.<br />\nI wasn't about to go to the first<br />\nMeeting of the Caucus. There was no way<br />\n'Was going to be openly affiliated with it.<br />\nWhat would the jocks down the hall say?<br />\nI simply sat in my room on that night<br />\nI n early October of last year and<br />\nspeculated on the probable scene in<br />\nConference Room B.<br />\nA good friend of mine who knew I was<br />\ngaY but was himself straight did attend<br />\nthe first meeting, and he had a very<br />\nencouraging report to give me\u2014about 30<br />\nPeople attended, there were no hecklers,<br />\nand the meeting ran smoothly. Now I was<br />\n<br />\nreally surprised. What would have quickly<br />\nbecome a public issue of great interest at<br />\nhome\u2014especially among the members of<br />\nthe conservative, fundamentalist<br />\ndenominations\u2014didn't seem to have<br />\nattracted much attention at all here on<br />\ncampus.<br />\nOne immediate result of my covert<br />\nconnection with the Gay Caucus was that<br />\nI found I knew more gays than I had<br />\nthought. Some were rather<br />\ntiamboyant\u2014\"Better blatant than latent,\"<br />\nas the saying goes\u2014but some people who<br />\nseemed perfectly \"normal\" turned out to<br />\nbe just that, normal and homosexual.<br />\nIt was reassuring to know that there<br />\nwere many Hopkins gays who didn't try<br />\nto hide their sexual identity, but I was<br />\nnot yet ready to step completely out of<br />\nthe closet (I still haven't). But shortly<br />\nbefore the end of my first semester, I<br />\nopenly went to a meeting of the Caucus. I<br />\ndid not publicly announce that I was<br />\ngoing, but I did go. I paid for my bravery<br />\nby having a nervous stomach for three<br />\ndays before the eVent.<br />\nMy first meeting was a very rewarding<br />\nexperience. I had never been in a room<br />\nfull of people where everyone was either<br />\ngay or sympathetic to gays. It was the<br />\nfirst time in my life I could relax and feel<br />\nperfectly natural without feeling<br />\nparanoid.(I had spent three years fearing<br />\nthat everyone who looked at me<br />\nimmediately knew I was gay and pitied<br />\nand/or despised me. I was Hector Prynne,<br />\nand my badge was a flaming \"F.\")<br />\nThe Caucus does sponsor social<br />\nactivities\u2014at which mutual consent<br />\nreplaces molestation\u2014but it is also<br />\ninvolved in such serious things as<br />\nimproving the legal and political status of<br />\ngays and relieving the pressure we feel in<br />\neveryday living in a sometimes unfriendly.<br />\nworld. When I found that members of the<br />\nCaucus had gone to Annapolis to lobby<br />\n<br />\nfor a bill making job discrimination<br />\nbecause of sexual orientation illegal, I was<br />\nvery much impressed. If that was<br />\nattempted in my state, every member of<br />\nthe fading Ku Klux Klan and of the local<br />\nBaptist or Pentecostal church would be<br />\nout on the streets fighting the spread of<br />\n\"perversion,\" the thought that their own<br />\nsons or daughters might be gay never<br />\noccuring to them.<br />\nMy dealings with the Caucus have been<br />\nslight\u2014I am still very much a \"Wardrobe<br />\nMonarch\"\u2014but I have found the simple<br />\nknowledge that it exists to ber very<br />\ncomforting. I don't think there are many<br />\nplaces where it's easy to be gay, and<br />\nHopkins gays are fortunate to have some<br />\nassistance. Sure, Baltimore and Hopkins<br />\nmay seem oppressive to someone from<br />\nNew York or San Francisco, but to<br />\nsomeone from the liberal state of<br />\nArkansas, this is a wonderful place.<br />\nGay life in Baltimore is, of course, not<br />\nconfined to the JHU campus. Early in my<br />\nsecond semester here, I worked up the<br />\ncourage to go to some of the gay bars;<br />\ninstitutions of a similar nature at home<br />\nare raided regularly by the police, and no<br />\none worries too much if a few faggots<br />\nlose their teeth or get their heads smashed<br />\non the way to jail. Once again, I found it<br />\nrelaxing to be in a place where I didn't<br />\nhave to worry about who was watching or<br />\nwhat the neighbors might do. Personally,<br />\nI don't particularly enjoy the bars, but<br />\nthey are good places to go when I need to<br />\nrelax and do things one doesn't do in the<br />\nRat\u2014like dancing with another guy.<br />\nAlthough the only gay bar to get a<br />\nlisting in this year's Handbook is the<br />\nHippo, there are two other gay bars in the<br />\nnear vicinity\u2014Mary's and Leon's. For the<br />\nmale Hopkins gay without independent<br />\ntransportation, these are probably the<br />\nonly bars worth the walk or the bus ride.<br />\nThe women are less fortunate; the best<br />\n<br />\nwomen's bars are located in Easi<br />\nBaltimore.<br />\nIf you don't care to go to the bars<br />\nabout the only place to meet other gays i!<br />\nat the meetings of the Caucus (or perhap5<br />\ncertain levels of Eisenhower Library)<br />\nOther than that, you're on your own,but<br />\none shouldn't forget the streets of Charles<br />\nVillage on any pleasant day; one should<br />\nforget Wyman Park.<br />\nI believe it's unfortunate that very few<br />\nof the gays on campus involve themselves<br />\neven minimally in the activities .of the<br />\nGay Caucus. Including myself\u2014an<br />\narguable point\u2014only two gays in my class<br />\nhave \"come out.\" Taking the incidence of<br />\nhomosexuality at Hopkins to be about<br />\n6% (a conservative figure, assuming the<br />\ncampus to be representative of the<br />\nnational figure), it is obvious that there<br />\nare a lot of people who are not involving<br />\nthemselves in the activities of gay<br />\nHopkins. I understand the difficulties<br />\ninvolved in coming out\u2014my family isn't<br />\naware that I'm gay, and I don't want<br />\nthem to get the news just yet\u2014but one<br />\ncan be involved without being a member<br />\nof the Caucus.

I<br />\nusually always pay her on time,<br />\nexcept that I got fired from my<br />\njob yesterday and I couldn't earn<br />\nany money today to pay her<br />\nwith. My room ain't even the<br />\nbest one either, it's probably the<br />\nworst but I've never seen the<br />\ninsides of the others. Mine has a<br />\nlittle wodden bed in the corner<br />\nwith a mattress and a square<br />\nbrown formica table held up by a<br />\nmetal post in the floor, and a<br />\nlittler table between my bed and<br />\nthe window. It's really half a<br />\ncrate that I took from the alley,<br />\nbut I don't tell people that. My<br />\nwindow lets me see four stories<br />\ndown to the street that's mostly<br />\nfull of kids screaming and cars all<br />\n<br />\nover the place. Most oi tue<br />\nbuildings around here are getting<br />\nknocked down now. They are<br />\nusing big new machines that are<br />\nyellow to do it.<br />\nremember the first time I saw<br />\none of those machines at my old<br />\nhouse. The machines were<br />\nsmaller and dirtier and they<br />\nmoved around a lot slower and<br />\ncouldn't knock down as much as<br />\nthey can now, but they were<br />\nstrong enough to knock over my<br />\nold house. The boy in the bed<br />\nnext to mine told me that the<br />\nmachines costed a lot of money<br />\nbecause they were always trying<br />\nto make bigger, better, stronger<br />\nones and that took money. The<br />\nway they tore down our old<br />\nhouse was neat. Four of them<br />\nmade most of it fall at once; then<br />\nthey just cleaned up the mess. I<br />\ngot to watch most of the job but<br />\nthen the bus came and took us all<br />\nto our new house which wasn't<br />\n<br />\nnowhere as good as the old one.<br />\nBut now I got my own room and<br />\nI like to watch the new machines<br />\nout my window except they're so<br />\nnoisy now. Mostly I just close the<br />\nwindow and pull the shade that<br />\nhas a few holes in it so the noise<br />\nain't so bad. The floor in my<br />\nroom is wood and cold and the<br />\ncuffs of my pants-legs get dirty if<br />\nI walk around a lot on it. The<br />\nmirror on the back of my door is<br />\ncracked on one side but I can still<br />\nuse it. I just look at one half of<br />\nmy face at a time. Two of my<br />\nWalls have wallpaper with roses<br />\nbut they're not really red roses<br />\nand the paper is peeling off and<br />\ncracking a little. My other walls<br />\nare plain wallboard that gets<br />\ndirty real easy and you can't rub<br />\nit off or it just streaks and gets<br />\nthe wall dirtier. Most of the time<br />\nwhen I'm in my room I sleep or<br />\nlisten to my radio. I found it in<br />\nthe street one morning and I kept<br />\nit. It's black and small with a dial<br />\non one side for loudness and one<br />\non the other side for changing<br />\nthe stations, but I can only get<br />\none channel anyway because I<br />\n<br />\nthink it got busted. I like my<br />\nroom. But that's not what this is<br />\nabout.<br />\nJobs<br />\nI have a hard time looking for<br />\njobs, or finding them. Whenever I<br />\ngo to find a job I always look in<br />\nthe newspapers first and then go<br />\nto the factory or place where the<br />\njob is. I always leave in plenty of<br />\ntime to be early for the thing and<br />\nI dress in my best clothes because<br />\nthe employment lady said that it<br />\nwould help so they can't tell I'm<br />\nso poor. I tell most places that I<br />\nwant the job so I'll have<br />\nsomething to do besides listen to<br />\nmy radio, and that I don't really<br />\nneed the money. I told one man<br />\nin a job office that I was a really<br />\nrich man with a car and a house<br />\nwho never worked before but<br />\ndecided to try. Everytime I try to<br />\nget a job, though, I don't get one.<br />\nIt's because I don't have a<br />\ntelephone, I'm sure of that. What<br />\nI mean is that whenever I go for a<br />\njob they tell me they'll call me if<br />\nI can have the job and I say okay<br />\nbut I don't have a phone and<br />\nthey say that's allright they'll let<br />\nme know. But they never do. So<br />\nI figured it out. What I needed<br />\nwas a phone in my room. Then<br />\nwhen I went for a job and they<br />\nsaid they'd call I could just say<br />\nokay and I could even get one<br />\nthe same color as my radio. I<br />\nmade up my mind to go to the<br />\ntelephone place down the street<br />\nand get a phone. I walked for a<br />\nwhile on the street between the<br />\ncurb and the parked cars. I don't<br />\nlike to walk on sidewalks because<br />\nyou have to always jump out of<br />\nother people's ways. Cars are<br />\neasier to walk between. On the<br />\nway, I stopped for a while to<br />\nwatch the machines that were<br />\nbusy knocking over a shopping<br />\nrenter. These machines were<br />\nreally big, the biggest ones I ever<br />\nseen. They were painted real<br />\nbright yellow and were kept<br />\nclean all the time. These ones<br />\ncould move faster than cars too,<br />\n<br />\nand boy were they strongiit only<br />\ntook two of them to knock over<br />\nthe whole shopping center. 1<br />\nwatched them for a while from<br />\nthe other side of the street before<br />\nI left. But when I got to the<br />\ntelephone place the men told me<br />\nI had to pay for a phone even if I<br />\ndidn't have a job anymore. I tried<br />\nto tell them that I couldn't get<br />\nmoney until I got a job and I<br />\ncouldn't get a job unless I had a<br />\nphone for the employment lady<br />\nto call . me back on but none of<br />\nthem listened. They pushed me<br />\nout of the dumb brick building<br />\non to the sidewalk where I<br />\nknocked over a lady by<br />\nstumbling. She was fat and<br />\nprobably rich because she had<br />\njewelry and a poodle and<br />\neverything about smelled new.<br />\nMy landlady says I'm dumb and<br />\ncan't learn anything ever but I<br />\nlearned something from the rich<br />\nlady. That's what this is about.<br />\nSince then I've known why illy<br />\nlandlady yells at me for rent and<br />\nwhy . employment ladies say<br />\nthey'll call me back even when I<br />\ndon't have a phone and why the<br />\nphone company won't give me 3<br />\nphone so I can get a job. I did<br />\nlearn from that lady I knocked<br />\nover because when she pulled<br />\nherself up she said, \"I hate you<br />\nfor that,...I'd hate you anyway.<br />\nThat's what this is about. They<br />\nall hate me. They would<br />\nprobably hate my room too.<br />\nOn my way home that day the<br />\nmen at the wrecked shopping<br />\ncenter were cleaning off their<br />\nmachines and making sure they'd<br />\nrun perfect the next time and I<br />\nheard two of them in suits<br />\ntalking about may be buying a<br />\nnewer mac inc since they're so<br />\nmuch etter than the old ones. I<br />\ncrossed the street and all of them<br />\nwatched me as I got closer. I<br />\nheard one of them say that a new<br />\nmachine costed more than the<br />\nwhole shopping center. Ii I had<br />\none of those machines I would<br />\nsell it and rent all my landlady's<br />\nrooms.<br />\n<br />\n10011101301110111101110111011111111110111.91110111~1111\u2022MOMMINIMMIHMIIIMIONO<br />\n<br />\n--<br />\n<br />\nBA E.<br />\n<br />\nT/U1<br />\n<br />\n./E<br />\n<br />\n\u2022<br />\n<br />\n1 \\\u2022\\<br />\n<br />\nA variety show, in film, of singin, dancing and<br />\nvarious nationalities of China performed by The<br />\nChinese Art Troupe, whose visit to -the United<br />\nStates has been indefinitely postponed due to the<br />\ndisagreement of the I .S.

He was the \"King of the<br />\nBeats\", writing of the beat<br />\nlifestyle he and his friends lived<br />\nthrough the fifties and sixties. He<br />\nstood unique among the ,Beat,<br />\napolitical, writing 1000 word<br />\nessays to his radical friends<br />\nCondemning the Left.

Kerouac said his style<br />\nresulted from his background as a<br />\nCatholic, and his ramblings<br />\nduring weekly confession.<br />\nRevisions to a manuscript were<br />\nrare -only occuring when<br />\nabsolutely necessary to sell a<br />\nbook.

For example: `, I want to<br />\nstretch a pretty girl with soft lips<br />\nwho maybe usherettes on Sunday<br />\nat a B-movie on Main Street, or<br />\nwhichever street that is, over a<br />\nsandy old lousy bed in a fishing<br />\nshack along the brown sluggish<br />\nold Neuse River, and lay her.\"<br />\nMany authors might, on second<br />\nreading, change 'usherettes' to<br />\nthe more grammatically perfect<br />\n'ushers', thus destroying the<br />\nbeauty of the line.

His style imposes an artistic<br />\nkind of aura about his work that<br />\nputs it in a limbo between fact<br />\nand fiction; between the real, the<br />\nsurreal, and the unreal. In his last<br />\npublished novel, Pic, Kerouac<br />\ntells the story of a young black<br />\nboy on a bus ride to New York<br />\nafter his grandfather's<br />\ndeath\u2014\"On the crossroads Mr.<br />\nDunaston let me and old hound<br />\ndog sit on the steps of his store<br />\never' blessed evenin and I heard<br />\nthe purty singin on the radio just<br />\nas plain,just as good, and learned<br />\nme two, th'ee, seben songs and<br />\nsing them.\"<br />\nThe story may be true, but the<br />\n'dialect is so superbly accurate,<br />\nand the novel se well written that<br />\nwhether it is fact or fiction is not<br />\nimportant.

And Maggie<br />\nCassidy, about his first love in a<br />\nLowell high school in 1939.<br />\nIn his wake Kerouac has left a<br />\ndistinct artistic heritage--now<br />\npursued chiefly by three<br />\nmusicians. Bob Dylan's lyrics are<br />\n<br />\nreminiscent both of Kerouac's<br />\nairy moralizing (\"Idiot Wind\"),<br />\nand of Kerouac's surreal<br />\ndescriptions of America (\"Black<br />\nDiamond Bay\"). Both cling, as<br />\nartists, to unorthodox and<br />\nunattractive, though charismatic,<br />\nstyles. The cover notes on Desire<br />\ngive an eerie feeling-of deja vu to<br />\na reader, of Kerouac: \"Romance<br />\nis taking over. Tolstoy was right.<br />\nThese notes are being written in a<br />\nbathtub in Maine under ideal<br />\nconditions, in every curio lounge<br />\nfrom Brooklyn to Guam, from<br />\nLowell to Durango oh sister,<br />\nwhen I fall into your spacy arms,<br />\ncan not ya feel the weight of<br />\noblivion. .\" The reference to<br />\nLowell is particularly indicative<br />\nof Dylan's artistic<br />\ninheritance\u2014mention of,<br />\nRimbaud. karma, and California<br />\nalso point to that line of heritage.<br />\nKerouac's close friend Allen<br />\nGinsberg, perhpas the major<br />\nliving literary influence on<br />\nKerouac's work, is a friend of<br />\nDylan and read poetry briefly<br />\nwith the Rolling Thunder Revue.<br />\nBruce Springsteen's lyrics also<br />\nresemble Kerouac stylistically, as<br />\nhis voice evokes memories of<br />\nRoy Orbison.

As Ann Charters<br />\nsaid in a biography, \"His books<br />\nare evidence of his presence, the<br />\nyoung Jack still alive on his pages<br />\nto rush on to the nFxt adventure<br />\nso long as there are people wha<br />\nread the Legend of Duluoz.\"<br />\n<br />\n\fpage 4/news-letterioctober 8,1976<br />\n<br />\nJudging with J.D.<br />\n<br />\nSigned, sealed, delivered, I'm yours for only $13.98<br />\nBy J.D.

But when one of the<br />\nhottest talents in Rock\u2014Pop-Soul<br />\ndoesn't do anything for almost<br />\ntwo years, a new album is an<br />\nevent. Although no figures are<br />\ndefinite, it looks as if over<br />\n100,000 copies'of the new album<br />\nhave been sold in the<br />\nBaltimore/Washington area alone,<br />\nsince its release last Thursday..<br />\nNow comes the part where the<br />\ncritic tells you how GREAT the<br />\nnew album is, and raves through<br />\nparagraphs while the reader nods<br />\nhis head in agreement, mumbling,<br />\n\"Yeah, man! Dig it!\" Only that's<br />\nnot the story here. Perhaps it was<br />\nbecause I expect more out of a<br />\ncapital<br />\nEvent, but as great as<br />\nthe new album is, there are still<br />\nthings to be said against it.<br />\nFirst the praise. It is an<br />\nexcellent album, considerably<br />\nbetter than Fulfillingness' First<br />\nFinale, and in many ways better<br />\nthan the classic Innervisions. The<br />\ntunes are snappy and supple, and<br />\nthe lyrics manage to escape the<br />\nbanality of most R & B jive. The<br />\nconcept of the album is coherent,<br />\nif slightly rambling, and the<br />\nengineering and production are<br />\nmiles above the norm for<br />\nMotown. The package, with two<br />\n12 inch LPs, a book, and a<br />\ncurious 7 inch disc, the size and<br />\nshape of a 45, but played at 33<br />\nwitli two songs per side.<br />\nTo list a favorite song is<br />\ndifficult. There are so many good<br />\ntunes here, the listener is caught<br />\nlike a child in a candy store with<br />\none choice and dozens of<br />\noptions. \"Sir Duke,\" with its<br />\nlight, reggae-based rhythm track<br />\nand snappy horn arrangements is<br />\na top contender, but then so are<br />\n\"Isn't She Lovely,\" \"I Wish,\"<br />\n\"Ordinary Pain,\" \"All Day<br />\nSucker,\" \"As,\"...well, I could go<br />\non. The album opens with a<br />\ntypical Wonder ballad,\"Love's in<br />\nNeed of Love Today,\" an<br />\nattractive if forgettable tune<br />\nwhich leads into the ,sermonette<br />\nfunk of \"Have a Talk With God\"<br />\n(remember \"Higher Ground?)<br />\n\"Village Ghetto Land\" is an idea<br />\nwith all the bite of Gil<br />\nScott-Heron, but more musical<br />\ninvective, placing irony-clenched<br />\nghetto horroros into a series of<br />\nperverse platitutdes afloat in- a<br />\nmusical background reminiscent<br />\nof \"In an English Country<br />\nGarden.\" Stevie's synthesized<br />\nstrings (courtesy his Yamaha<br />\nPolyphonic Synthesizer\u2014) sound<br />\namazingly like the real thing. and<br />\nthe arrangement is so<br />\nstring-oriented that it is hard to<br />\nremember that it is a keyboard<br />\n<br />\nlick. \"Contusion,\" a snappy<br />\ninstrumental is chased down by<br />\nthe aforementioned \"Sir Duke,\"<br />\na tune I love even if it does rate<br />\nGlenn Miller with the Likes of<br />\nArmstrong, and Basie (whatabout<br />\nBenny Goodman)<br />\nSide Two is perhaps my<br />\nfavorite side overall; at least, it's<br />\nside I play the most. Opening<br />\nwith \"I Wish,\" a delightful<br />\nreminiscence of a pleasantly<br />\nmisspent youth:<br />\nBrother says he's tellin'<br />\n'Bout you playin' doctor with that<br />\ngirl<br />\nJust don't tell and I'll give you<br />\nAnything you want in this whole<br />\nwide world<br />\n<br />\n\"Ngiculela/Es Una Historia,\" and<br />\n\"If It's Magic.\" \"As\" is one of<br />\nthe best love songs Stevie has<br />\never written, with clever, sincere<br />\nlyrics set against an energetic<br />\nmelody and rhythm track. Herbie<br />\nHancock is featured on electric<br />\npiano, and does very little.<br />\n\"Another Star,\" a latin cooker<br />\nin the traditon of \"Don't You<br />\nWorry 'Bout A Thing,\" sews up<br />\nthe side, with some breathily<br />\nbrazen flute work, courtesy the<br />\namazingly funky Bobbi<br />\nHumphrey.<br />\nThen there's the little \"bonus\"<br />\ndisc, featuring \"Saturn,\" a tune<br />\nkind of like what you'd expect,<br />\nsay, Hall & Oates to do.\"All Day<br />\nSucker\" is a rhythmic delight,<br />\nwith the kind of kinky beat that<br />\ngrabs you and doesn't let go.<br />\n\"Easy Goin' Evening\" (\"My<br />\nMama's Call\") is double-tracked<br />\nharmonica schmaltz, the kind of<br />\n<br />\ncontinues through some pleasant<br />\nballad material (\"Pastime<br />\nParadise\" being especially fine,)<br />\nand goes into \"Ordinary Pain.\"<br />\n\"Pain\" is one of the album's<br />\nmasterworks; essentially a love<br />\nsong from both sides. It opens<br />\nwith a medium tempo ballad,<br />\nabout a guy trying to get over<br />\nbeing rejected by his lover:<br />\nDon't fool yourself<br />\nBut tell no one else<br />\nThat it's more than just<br />\nAn ordinary pain<br />\nIn your heart.<br />\nThen the music turns nasty, a<br />\nhard-edged funk beat taking over<br />\nthe ballad, and the girl tells her<br />\nstory, beginning \"You're just a<br />\nmasochistic fool...,\" the back up<br />\nvocals chanting \"Ordinary Pain\"<br />\nas a caustic refrain. What we are<br />\nOven is a \"poor little me,I loved<br />\nand lost\" song, along with its<br />\n\"you lost because you didn't<br />\nknow what was going down\"<br />\ncounter chorus. We can only feel<br />\npartly sorry for the self=the<br />\nself-deceived - fool, and only<br />\npartly dislike the girl who did<br />\nhim in. Why can't pop stars write<br />\nmore tunes like this, instead of<br />\ngrinding out countless \"Silly<br />\n:3.<br />\nc/a<br />\nLove Songs?<br />\n\"Isn't She Lovely' (on side<br />\nthree) is a snappy little tune with<br />\nthe jazziest feel on the album,<br />\nwhich Stevie wrote about his<br />\ndaughter, Aisha. Little Stevie's<br />\nharmonica charms its way around<br />\nthe changes, and we are treated<br />\nto tapes of baby Aisha crying,<br />\nlaughing, talking, and so on.<br />\nEngagingly cute. \"Joy Inside My<br />\n\"Love, Hate and Marriage:\"<br />\nTears,\" which follows, has<br />\nSnatches of Spoon River<br />\nprobably the best melody of any<br />\nAnthology, \"I Do; I Do,\" and<br />\n\"The Importance of Being<br />\nballad on the album.<br />\nEarnest;\" plus more. New faces<br />\nClosing out the side, \"Black<br />\nin new places -- tah-dah: The<br />\nMan\" combines an almost<br />\nFreshman One Acts.<br />\nmindless didacticism with a<br />\n\"Ma,What is love?<br />\ndriving, disco-funk beat.<br />\nLove and hate are the two<br />\nAlthough I feel enlightened to<br />\nleast frequently used four-letter<br />\nknow that the first stop-light was<br />\nwords.

After awhile, the rhythm<br />\ntracks sound distressingly similar,<br />\nand the chord progressions are<br />\nnoticeably predicatable. Even<br />\nwith some of the big-name side<br />\nmen on board, such as George<br />\nBenson, Herbie Hancock, and<br />\nBobbi Humphrey, their<br />\ncontributions are minimal to the<br />\npoint of being unnoticeable.<br />\nMotown, Tamla's parent<br />\ncompany, has never been much<br />\nfor slick instrumental<br />\nproductions, except when trying<br />\nto sound like boradway (the old<br />\nSupremes being the best example<br />\nof that twisted aesthetic). But<br />\nwith the friends Stevie Wonder<br />\n<br />\nLove<br />\n<br />\nhas, he could have easily brought<br />\nin someone like Quincy Jones to<br />\nspice things up.

Allow me to<br />\nillustrate exactly what I mean.<br />\n!. The Deans office in<br />\nHomewood House, in<br />\nconjunction with Omicron Delta<br />\nKappa offers a free tutoring<br />\nservice to students with probleTs<br />\nin specific areas. The News-Letter<br />\nhas been contacted about the<br />\nneed to publicize the program as<br />\na service to students but have not<br />\nresponded.<br />\n2.

The notice has<br />\nappeared only twice. Instead, we<br />\n<br />\nhave been treated to the frequent<br />\nappearances of \"Academic<br />\nResearch Papers For Sale.\" When<br />\nthe unethical replaces the<br />\nessential, a reevaluation of<br />\npriorities is long overdue.<br />\n3. Along more general lines, it<br />\nseems to me that the Hopkins<br />\ncommunity would be more than<br />\ninterested in knowing the new<br />\nfaculty and visiting professors, as<br />\nwell as what the Academic<br />\nCouncil and CUS (Committee on<br />\nUndergraduate Studies) have<br />\nbeen doing.<br />\nThe News-Letter does have an<br />\nobligation to students, contrary<br />\nto what some may believe.

Four groups of walkers from<br />\nacross the country will converge<br />\nto protest \"the misplaced<br />\npriorities of the federal<br />\ngovernment.\"<br />\nConceived a year ago by the<br />\nWar Resisters League, the<br />\nContinental Walk focuses on the<br />\nbillions spent for nuclear<br />\nweapons and military programs<br />\nas schools, housing, hospitals,<br />\nand community services suffer<br />\nfrom a lack of funds. A<br />\ncoordinating committee in states<br />\nalong the four routes (started<br />\nfrom Boston, North Carolina,<br />\nNew Orleans, and San Francisco)<br />\nhas worked on setting up<br />\neducational forums, organizing<br />\ndemonstrations, and housing<br />\nwalkers in local areas.<br />\n\"Social change is not going to<br />\ncome through the media,\"<br />\nexplained Dave Pittman, a<br />\nmember of the Maryland<br />\nCommittee for the Continental<br />\nWalk. \"Long distance walking is a<br />\nsymbol of a slow, methodical<br />\nway of accomplishment. That's<br />\nthe kind of effort needed in local<br />\ncommunities if there's going to<br />\nbe social change.\"<br />\nPointing to the civil rights and<br />\npeace movements of the sixties,<br />\nthe Continental Walk stresses<br />\nthat power can be \"turned<br />\naround\" in America.

Not<br />\nmentioning any specific names of<br />\nthese new players, Ciccarone said<br />\nthat three middies, four<br />\nat t ackmen, three defensemen,<br />\nand a goalie all have chances to<br />\nmake significant contributions to<br />\nthe fall squad.

But I come<br />\nfrom a state where, to the best of my<br />\nknowledge (my inquiries have had to be<br />\nvery discreet), no college or university has<br />\na homophile organization.

I<br />\ndon't like to think of what would happen<br />\nIf someone attempted to start a<br />\nhomophile organization on the campus in<br />\nMY hometown. At the very least, the<br />\nPolice would be called in to break up the<br />\nfirst meeting; at the very worst, they<br />\nOught not be called in to break up a near<br />\nlYnching of \"perverts.\"<br />\nMy hopes of living a reasonable,<br />\nout-of-the-closet life were encouraged<br />\nWhen I came to Hopkins. Only a month<br />\nafter my freshman year began, I saw<br />\nadvertisements for the formation of the<br />\nGaY Caucus. Accustomed to thinking that<br />\nsuch things simply weren't done, I was<br />\nboth a little bit shocked and elated.<br />\nI wasn't about to go to the first<br />\nMeeting of the Caucus. There was no way<br />\n'Was going to be openly affiliated with it.<br />\nWhat would the jocks down the hall say?<br />\nI simply sat in my room on that night<br />\nI n early October of last year and<br />\nspeculated on the probable scene in<br />\nConference Room B.<br />\nA good friend of mine who knew I was<br />\ngaY but was himself straight did attend<br />\nthe first meeting, and he had a very<br />\nencouraging report to give me\u2014about 30<br />\nPeople attended, there were no hecklers,<br />\nand the meeting ran smoothly. Now I was<br /><br />\nreally surprised. What would have quickly<br />\nbecome a public issue of great interest at<br />\nhome\u2014especially among the members of<br />\nthe conservative, fundamentalist<br />\ndenominations\u2014didn't seem to have<br />\nattracted much attention at all here on<br />\ncampus.<br />\nOne immediate result of my covert<br />\nconnection with the Gay Caucus was that<br />\nI found I knew more gays than I had<br />\nthought. Some were rather<br />\ntiamboyant\u2014\"Better blatant than latent,\"<br />\nas the saying goes\u2014but some people who<br />\nseemed perfectly \"normal\" turned out to<br />\nbe just that, normal and homosexual.<br />\nIt was reassuring to know that there<br />\nwere many Hopkins gays who didn't try<br />\nto hide their sexual identity, but I was<br />\nnot yet ready to step completely out of<br />\nthe closet (I still haven't). But shortly<br />\nbefore the end of my first semester, I<br />\nopenly went to a meeting of the Caucus. I<br />\ndid not publicly announce that I was<br />\ngoing, but I did go. I paid for my bravery<br />\nby having a nervous stomach for three<br />\ndays before the eVent.<br />\nMy first meeting was a very rewarding<br />\nexperience. I had never been in a room<br />\nfull of people where everyone was either<br />\ngay or sympathetic to gays. It was the<br />\nfirst time in my life I could relax and feel<br />\nperfectly natural without feeling<br />\nparanoid.(I had spent three years fearing<br />\nthat everyone who looked at me<br />\nimmediately knew I was gay and pitied<br />\nand/or despised me. I was Hector Prynne,<br />\nand my badge was a flaming \"F.\")<br />\nThe Caucus does sponsor social<br />\nactivities\u2014at which mutual consent<br />\nreplaces molestation\u2014but it is also<br />\ninvolved in such serious things as<br />\nimproving the legal and political status of<br />\ngays and relieving the pressure we feel in<br />\neveryday living in a sometimes unfriendly.<br />\nworld. When I found that members of the<br />\nCaucus had gone to Annapolis to lobby<br /><br />\nfor a bill making job discrimination<br />\nbecause of sexual orientation illegal, I was<br />\nvery much impressed. If that was<br />\nattempted in my state, every member of<br />\nthe fading Ku Klux Klan and of the local<br />\nBaptist or Pentecostal church would be<br />\nout on the streets fighting the spread of<br />\n\"perversion,\" the thought that their own<br />\nsons or daughters might be gay never<br />\noccuring to them.<br />\nMy dealings with the Caucus have been<br />\nslight\u2014I am still very much a \"Wardrobe<br />\nMonarch\"\u2014but I have found the simple<br />\nknowledge that it exists to ber very<br />\ncomforting. I don't think there are many<br />\nplaces where it's easy to be gay, and<br />\nHopkins gays are fortunate to have some<br />\nassistance. Sure, Baltimore and Hopkins<br />\nmay seem oppressive to someone from<br />\nNew York or San Francisco, but to<br />\nsomeone from the liberal state of<br />\nArkansas, this is a wonderful place.<br />\nGay life in Baltimore is, of course, not<br />\nconfined to the JHU campus. Early in my<br />\nsecond semester here, I worked up the<br />\ncourage to go to some of the gay bars;<br />\ninstitutions of a similar nature at home<br />\nare raided regularly by the police, and no<br />\none worries too much if a few faggots<br />\nlose their teeth or get their heads smashed<br />\non the way to jail. Once again, I found it<br />\nrelaxing to be in a place where I didn't<br />\nhave to worry about who was watching or<br />\nwhat the neighbors might do. Personally,<br />\nI don't particularly enjoy the bars, but<br />\nthey are good places to go when I need to<br />\nrelax and do things one doesn't do in the<br />\nRat\u2014like dancing with another guy.<br />\nAlthough the only gay bar to get a<br />\nlisting in this year's Handbook is the<br />\nHippo, there are two other gay bars in the<br />\nnear vicinity\u2014Mary's and Leon's. For the<br />\nmale Hopkins gay without independent<br />\ntransportation, these are probably the<br />\nonly bars worth the walk or the bus ride.<br />\nThe women are less fortunate; the best<br /><br />\nwomen's bars are located in Easi<br />\nBaltimore.<br />\nIf you don't care to go to the bars<br />\nabout the only place to meet other gays i!<br />\nat the meetings of the Caucus (or perhap5<br />\ncertain levels of Eisenhower Library)<br />\nOther than that, you're on your own,but<br />\none shouldn't forget the streets of Charles<br />\nVillage on any pleasant day; one should<br />\nforget Wyman Park.<br />\nI believe it's unfortunate that very few<br />\nof the gays on campus involve themselves<br />\neven minimally in the activities .of the<br />\nGay Caucus. Including myself\u2014an<br />\narguable point\u2014only two gays in my class<br />\nhave \"come out.\" Taking the incidence of<br />\nhomosexuality at Hopkins to be about<br />\n6% (a conservative figure, assuming the<br />\ncampus to be representative of the<br />\nnational figure), it is obvious that there<br />\nare a lot of people who are not involving<br />\nthemselves in the activities of gay<br />\nHopkins. I understand the difficulties<br />\ninvolved in coming out\u2014my family isn't<br />\naware that I'm gay, and I don't want<br />\nthem to get the news just yet\u2014but one<br />\ncan be involved without being a member<br />\nof the Caucus.

I<br />\nusually always pay her on time,<br />\nexcept that I got fired from my<br />\njob yesterday and I couldn't earn<br />\nany money today to pay her<br />\nwith. My room ain't even the<br />\nbest one either, it's probably the<br />\nworst but I've never seen the<br />\ninsides of the others. Mine has a<br />\nlittle wodden bed in the corner<br />\nwith a mattress and a square<br />\nbrown formica table held up by a<br />\nmetal post in the floor, and a<br />\nlittler table between my bed and<br />\nthe window. It's really half a<br />\ncrate that I took from the alley,<br />\nbut I don't tell people that. My<br />\nwindow lets me see four stories<br />\ndown to the street that's mostly<br />\nfull of kids screaming and cars all<br /><br />\nover the place. Most oi tue<br />\nbuildings around here are getting<br />\nknocked down now. They are<br />\nusing big new machines that are<br />\nyellow to do it.<br />\nremember the first time I saw<br />\none of those machines at my old<br />\nhouse. The machines were<br />\nsmaller and dirtier and they<br />\nmoved around a lot slower and<br />\ncouldn't knock down as much as<br />\nthey can now, but they were<br />\nstrong enough to knock over my<br />\nold house. The boy in the bed<br />\nnext to mine told me that the<br />\nmachines costed a lot of money<br />\nbecause they were always trying<br />\nto make bigger, better, stronger<br />\nones and that took money. The<br />\nway they tore down our old<br />\nhouse was neat. Four of them<br />\nmade most of it fall at once; then<br />\nthey just cleaned up the mess. I<br />\ngot to watch most of the job but<br />\nthen the bus came and took us all<br />\nto our new house which wasn't<br /><br />\nnowhere as good as the old one.<br />\nBut now I got my own room and<br />\nI like to watch the new machines<br />\nout my window except they're so<br />\nnoisy now. Mostly I just close the<br />\nwindow and pull the shade that<br />\nhas a few holes in it so the noise<br />\nain't so bad. The floor in my<br />\nroom is wood and cold and the<br />\ncuffs of my pants-legs get dirty if<br />\nI walk around a lot on it. The<br />\nmirror on the back of my door is<br />\ncracked on one side but I can still<br />\nuse it. I just look at one half of<br />\nmy face at a time. Two of my<br />\nWalls have wallpaper with roses<br />\nbut they're not really red roses<br />\nand the paper is peeling off and<br />\ncracking a little. My other walls<br />\nare plain wallboard that gets<br />\ndirty real easy and you can't rub<br />\nit off or it just streaks and gets<br />\nthe wall dirtier. Most of the time<br />\nwhen I'm in my room I sleep or<br />\nlisten to my radio. I found it in<br />\nthe street one morning and I kept<br />\nit. It's black and small with a dial<br />\non one side for loudness and one<br />\non the other side for changing<br />\nthe stations, but I can only get<br />\none channel anyway because I<br /><br />\nthink it got busted. I like my<br />\nroom. But that's not what this is<br />\nabout.<br />\nJobs<br />\nI have a hard time looking for<br />\njobs, or finding them. Whenever I<br />\ngo to find a job I always look in<br />\nthe newspapers first and then go<br />\nto the factory or place where the<br />\njob is. I always leave in plenty of<br />\ntime to be early for the thing and<br />\nI dress in my best clothes because<br />\nthe employment lady said that it<br />\nwould help so they can't tell I'm<br />\nso poor. I tell most places that I<br />\nwant the job so I'll have<br />\nsomething to do besides listen to<br />\nmy radio, and that I don't really<br />\nneed the money. I told one man<br />\nin a job office that I was a really<br />\nrich man with a car and a house<br />\nwho never worked before but<br />\ndecided to try. Everytime I try to<br />\nget a job, though, I don't get one.<br />\nIt's because I don't have a<br />\ntelephone, I'm sure of that. What<br />\nI mean is that whenever I go for a<br />\njob they tell me they'll call me if<br />\nI can have the job and I say okay<br />\nbut I don't have a phone and<br />\nthey say that's allright they'll let<br />\nme know. But they never do. So<br />\nI figured it out. What I needed<br />\nwas a phone in my room. Then<br />\nwhen I went for a job and they<br />\nsaid they'd call I could just say<br />\nokay and I could even get one<br />\nthe same color as my radio. I<br />\nmade up my mind to go to the<br />\ntelephone place down the street<br />\nand get a phone. I walked for a<br />\nwhile on the street between the<br />\ncurb and the parked cars. I don't<br />\nlike to walk on sidewalks because<br />\nyou have to always jump out of<br />\nother people's ways. Cars are<br />\neasier to walk between. On the<br />\nway, I stopped for a while to<br />\nwatch the machines that were<br />\nbusy knocking over a shopping<br />\nrenter. These machines were<br />\nreally big, the biggest ones I ever<br />\nseen. They were painted real<br />\nbright yellow and were kept<br />\nclean all the time. These ones<br />\ncould move faster than cars too,<br /><br />\nand boy were they strongiit only<br />\ntook two of them to knock over<br />\nthe whole shopping center. 1<br />\nwatched them for a while from<br />\nthe other side of the street before<br />\nI left. But when I got to the<br />\ntelephone place the men told me<br />\nI had to pay for a phone even if I<br />\ndidn't have a job anymore. I tried<br />\nto tell them that I couldn't get<br />\nmoney until I got a job and I<br />\ncouldn't get a job unless I had a<br />\nphone for the employment lady<br />\nto call . me back on but none of<br />\nthem listened. They pushed me<br />\nout of the dumb brick building<br />\non to the sidewalk where I<br />\nknocked over a lady by<br />\nstumbling. She was fat and<br />\nprobably rich because she had<br />\njewelry and a poodle and<br />\neverything about smelled new.<br />\nMy landlady says I'm dumb and<br />\ncan't learn anything ever but I<br />\nlearned something from the rich<br />\nlady. That's what this is about.<br />\nSince then I've known why illy<br />\nlandlady yells at me for rent and<br />\nwhy . employment ladies say<br />\nthey'll call me back even when I<br />\ndon't have a phone and why the<br />\nphone company won't give me 3<br />\nphone so I can get a job. I did<br />\nlearn from that lady I knocked<br />\nover because when she pulled<br />\nherself up she said, \"I hate you<br />\nfor that,...I'd hate you anyway.<br />\nThat's what this is about. They<br />\nall hate me. They would<br />\nprobably hate my room too.<br />\nOn my way home that day the<br />\nmen at the wrecked shopping<br />\ncenter were cleaning off their<br />\nmachines and making sure they'd<br />\nrun perfect the next time and I<br />\nheard two of them in suits<br />\ntalking about may be buying a<br />\nnewer mac inc since they're so<br />\nmuch etter than the old ones. I<br />\ncrossed the street and all of them<br />\nwatched me as I got closer. I<br />\nheard one of them say that a new<br />\nmachine costed more than the<br />\nwhole shopping center. Ii I had<br />\none of those machines I would<br />\nsell it and rent all my landlady's<br />\nrooms.<br /><br />\n10011101301110111101110111011111111110111.91110111~1111\u2022MOMMINIMMIHMIIIMIONO<br /><br />\n--<br /><br />\nBA E.<br /><br />\nT/U1<br /><br />\n./E<br /><br />\n\u2022<br /><br />\n1 \\\u2022\\<br /><br />\nA variety show, in film, of singin, dancing and<br />\nvarious nationalities of China performed by The<br />\nChinese Art Troupe, whose visit to -the United<br />\nStates has been indefinitely postponed due to the<br />\ndisagreement of the I .S.

He was the \"King of the<br />\nBeats\", writing of the beat<br />\nlifestyle he and his friends lived<br />\nthrough the fifties and sixties. He<br />\nstood unique among the ,Beat,<br />\napolitical, writing 1000 word<br />\nessays to his radical friends<br />\nCondemning the Left.

Typically<br />\nonly hyphens, periods, or<br />\ncommas separate passages in<br />\nKerouac's work, depending on<br />\nthe literary phase he was in at the<br /><br />\ntime. Kerouac said his style<br />\nresulted from his background as a<br />\nCatholic, and his ramblings<br />\nduring weekly confession.<br />\nRevisions to a manuscript were<br />\nrare -only occuring when<br />\nabsolutely necessary to sell a<br />\nbook.

For example: `, I want to<br />\nstretch a pretty girl with soft lips<br />\nwho maybe usherettes on Sunday<br />\nat a B-movie on Main Street, or<br />\nwhichever street that is, over a<br />\nsandy old lousy bed in a fishing<br />\nshack along the brown sluggish<br />\nold Neuse River, and lay her.\"<br />\nMany authors might, on second<br />\nreading, change 'usherettes' to<br />\nthe more grammatically perfect<br />\n'ushers', thus destroying the<br />\nbeauty of the line. Another<br />\ninstance\u2014 `tvhy did I ever tell<br />\nyou about how a Mississippi<br />\nRiver or Red River flood can<br />\nflood a golf course_ and<br />\nundermine tees?and make men<br />\nin white knickers weep? and<br />\nremind them that mud is where<br />\nthey came from?'<br />\nIs Kerouac's work fiction?In<br />\nterms of.content, it generally is<br />\nnot. His style imposes an artistic<br />\nkind of aura about his work that<br />\nputs it in a limbo between fact<br />\nand fiction; between the real, the<br />\nsurreal, and the unreal. In his last<br />\npublished novel, Pic, Kerouac<br />\ntells the story of a young black<br />\nboy on a bus ride to New York<br />\nafter his grandfather's<br />\ndeath\u2014\"On the crossroads Mr.<br />\nDunaston let me and old hound<br />\ndog sit on the steps of his store<br />\never' blessed evenin and I heard<br />\nthe purty singin on the radio just<br />\nas plain,just as good, and learned<br />\nme two, th'ee, seben songs and<br />\nsing them.\"<br />\nThe story may be true, but the<br />\n'dialect is so superbly accurate,<br />\nand the novel se well written that<br />\nwhether it is fact or fiction is not<br />\nimportant. Most of Kerouac's<br />\nbooks are- based on his own<br />\nlife\u2014Visions of Gerard, about his<br />\n'saintly' brother who died, age<br />\nnine, when Jack was four.<br />\nVisions of Cody,about his friend<br />\nNeal Cassady. Doctor Sax, about<br />\nhis childhood in Lowell, and<br />\naccompanying adolescent<br />\nfantasies. The Dharma Bums,<br />\nabout his experiences with<br />\nBuddhism. The Subterraneans,<br />\ndetailing his love for a black girl<br />\nnamed Mardou. And Maggie<br />\nCassidy, about his first love in a<br />\nLowell high school in 1939.<br />\nIn his wake Kerouac has left a<br />\ndistinct artistic heritage--now<br />\npursued chiefly by three<br />\nmusicians. Bob Dylan's lyrics are<br /><br />\nreminiscent both of Kerouac's<br />\nairy moralizing (\"Idiot Wind\"),<br />\nand of Kerouac's surreal<br />\ndescriptions of America (\"Black<br />\nDiamond Bay\"). Both cling, as<br />\nartists, to unorthodox and<br />\nunattractive, though charismatic,<br />\nstyles. The cover notes on Desire<br />\ngive an eerie feeling-of deja vu to<br />\na reader, of Kerouac: \"Romance<br />\nis taking over. Tolstoy was right.<br />\nThese notes are being written in a<br />\nbathtub in Maine under ideal<br />\nconditions, in every curio lounge<br />\nfrom Brooklyn to Guam, from<br />\nLowell to Durango oh sister,<br />\nwhen I fall into your spacy arms,<br />\ncan not ya feel the weight of<br />\noblivion. .\" The reference to<br />\nLowell is particularly indicative<br />\nof Dylan's artistic<br />\ninheritance\u2014mention of,<br />\nRimbaud. karma, and California<br />\nalso point to that line of heritage.<br />\nKerouac's close friend Allen<br />\nGinsberg, perhpas the major<br />\nliving literary influence on<br />\nKerouac's work, is a friend of<br />\nDylan and read poetry briefly<br />\nwith the Rolling Thunder Revue.<br />\nBruce Springsteen's lyrics also<br />\nresemble Kerouac stylistically, as<br />\nhis voice evokes memories of<br />\nRoy Orbison.

But when one of the<br />\nhottest talents in Rock\u2014Pop-Soul<br />\ndoesn't do anything for almost<br />\ntwo years, a new album is an<br />\nevent. Although no figures are<br />\ndefinite, it looks as if over<br />\n100,000 copies'of the new album<br />\nhave been sold in the<br />\nBaltimore/Washington area alone,<br />\nsince its release last Thursday..<br />\nNow comes the part where the<br />\ncritic tells you how GREAT the<br />\nnew album is, and raves through<br />\nparagraphs while the reader nods<br />\nhis head in agreement, mumbling,<br />\n\"Yeah, man! Dig it!\" Only that's<br />\nnot the story here. Perhaps it was<br />\nbecause I expect more out of a<br />\ncapital<br />\nEvent, but as great as<br />\nthe new album is, there are still<br />\nthings to be said against it.<br />\nFirst the praise. It is an<br />\nexcellent album, considerably<br />\nbetter than Fulfillingness' First<br />\nFinale, and in many ways better<br />\nthan the classic Innervisions. The<br />\ntunes are snappy and supple, and<br />\nthe lyrics manage to escape the<br />\nbanality of most R &amp; B jive. The<br />\nconcept of the album is coherent,<br />\nif slightly rambling, and the<br />\nengineering and production are<br />\nmiles above the norm for<br />\nMotown. The package, with two<br />\n12 inch LPs, a book, and a<br />\ncurious 7 inch disc, the size and<br />\nshape of a 45, but played at 33<br />\nwitli two songs per side.<br />\nTo list a favorite song is<br />\ndifficult. There are so many good<br />\ntunes here, the listener is caught<br />\nlike a child in a candy store with<br />\none choice and dozens of<br />\noptions. \"Sir Duke,\" with its<br />\nlight, reggae-based rhythm track<br />\nand snappy horn arrangements is<br />\na top contender, but then so are<br />\n\"Isn't She Lovely,\" \"I Wish,\"<br />\n\"Ordinary Pain,\" \"All Day<br />\nSucker,\" \"As,\"...well, I could go<br />\non. The album opens with a<br />\ntypical Wonder ballad,\"Love's in<br />\nNeed of Love Today,\" an<br />\nattractive if forgettable tune<br />\nwhich leads into the ,sermonette<br />\nfunk of \"Have a Talk With God\"<br />\n(remember \"Higher Ground?)<br />\n\"Village Ghetto Land\" is an idea<br />\nwith all the bite of Gil<br />\nScott-Heron, but more musical<br />\ninvective, placing irony-clenched<br />\nghetto horroros into a series of<br />\nperverse platitutdes afloat in- a<br />\nmusical background reminiscent<br />\nof \"In an English Country<br />\nGarden.\" Stevie's synthesized<br />\nstrings (courtesy his Yamaha<br />\nPolyphonic Synthesizer\u2014) sound<br />\namazingly like the real thing. and<br />\nthe arrangement is so<br />\nstring-oriented that it is hard to<br />\nremember that it is a keyboard<br /><br />\nlick. \"Contusion,\" a snappy<br />\ninstrumental is chased down by<br />\nthe aforementioned \"Sir Duke,\"<br />\na tune I love even if it does rate<br />\nGlenn Miller with the Likes of<br />\nArmstrong, and Basie (whatabout<br />\nBenny Goodman)<br />\nSide Two is perhaps my<br />\nfavorite side overall; at least, it's<br />\nside I play the most. Opening<br />\nwith \"I Wish,\" a delightful<br />\nreminiscence of a pleasantly<br />\nmisspent youth:<br />\nBrother says he's tellin'<br />\n'Bout you playin' doctor with that<br />\ngirl<br />\nJust don't tell and I'll give you<br />\nAnything you want in this whole<br />\nwide world<br /><br />\n\"Ngiculela/Es Una Historia,\" and<br />\n\"If It's Magic.\" \"As\" is one of<br />\nthe best love songs Stevie has<br />\never written, with clever, sincere<br />\nlyrics set against an energetic<br />\nmelody and rhythm track. Herbie<br />\nHancock is featured on electric<br />\npiano, and does very little.<br />\n\"Another Star,\" a latin cooker<br />\nin the traditon of \"Don't You<br />\nWorry 'Bout A Thing,\" sews up<br />\nthe side, with some breathily<br />\nbrazen flute work, courtesy the<br />\namazingly funky Bobbi<br />\nHumphrey.<br />\nThen there's the little \"bonus\"<br />\ndisc, featuring \"Saturn,\" a tune<br />\nkind of like what you'd expect,<br />\nsay, Hall &amp; Oates to do.\"All Day<br />\nSucker\" is a rhythmic delight,<br />\nwith the kind of kinky beat that<br />\ngrabs you and doesn't let go.<br />\n\"Easy Goin' Evening\" (\"My<br />\nMama's Call\") is double-tracked<br />\nharmonica schmaltz, the kind of<br /><br />\ncontinues through some pleasant<br />\nballad material (\"Pastime<br />\nParadise\" being especially fine,)<br />\nand goes into \"Ordinary Pain.\"<br />\n\"Pain\" is one of the album's<br />\nmasterworks; essentially a love<br />\nsong from both sides. It opens<br />\nwith a medium tempo ballad,<br />\nabout a guy trying to get over<br />\nbeing rejected by his lover:<br />\nDon't fool yourself<br />\nBut tell no one else<br />\nThat it's more than just<br />\nAn ordinary pain<br />\nIn your heart.<br />\nThen the music turns nasty, a<br />\nhard-edged funk beat taking over<br />\nthe ballad, and the girl tells her<br />\nstory, beginning \"You're just a<br />\nmasochistic fool...,\" the back up<br />\nvocals chanting \"Ordinary Pain\"<br />\nas a caustic refrain. What we are<br />\nOven is a \"poor little me,I loved<br />\nand lost\" song, along with its<br />\n\"you lost because you didn't<br />\nknow what was going down\"<br />\ncounter chorus. We can only feel<br />\npartly sorry for the self=the<br />\nself-deceived - fool, and only<br />\npartly dislike the girl who did<br />\nhim in. Why can't pop stars write<br />\nmore tunes like this, instead of<br />\ngrinding out countless \"Silly<br />\n:3.<br />\nc/a<br />\nLove Songs?<br />\n\"Isn't She Lovely' (on side<br />\nthree) is a snappy little tune with<br />\nthe jazziest feel on the album,<br />\nwhich Stevie wrote about his<br />\ndaughter, Aisha. Little Stevie's<br />\nharmonica charms its way around<br />\nthe changes, and we are treated<br />\nto tapes of baby Aisha crying,<br />\nlaughing, talking, and so on.<br />\nEngagingly cute. \"Joy Inside My<br />\n\"Love, Hate and Marriage:\"<br />\nTears,\" which follows, has<br />\nSnatches of Spoon River<br />\nprobably the best melody of any<br />\nAnthology, \"I Do; I Do,\" and<br />\n\"The Importance of Being<br />\nballad on the album.<br />\nEarnest;\" plus more.

After awhile, the rhythm<br />\ntracks sound distressingly similar,<br />\nand the chord progressions are<br />\nnoticeably predicatable. Even<br />\nwith some of the big-name side<br />\nmen on board, such as George<br />\nBenson, Herbie Hancock, and<br />\nBobbi Humphrey, their<br />\ncontributions are minimal to the<br />\npoint of being unnoticeable.<br />\nMotown, Tamla's parent<br />\ncompany, has never been much<br />\nfor slick instrumental<br />\nproductions, except when trying<br />\nto sound like boradway (the old<br />\nSupremes being the best example<br />\nof that twisted aesthetic). But<br />\nwith the friends Stevie Wonder<br /><br />\nLove<br /><br />\nhas, he could have easily brought<br />\nin someone like Quincy Jones to<br />\nspice things up. As good as his<br />\nwriting is, his playing, especially<br />\nhis drumming, is mere adequate.<br />\nHis music deserves more than<br />\nthat.<br />\nDespite this, there will be few<br />\nwho will notice. The Beatles<br />\nmaintained unheard of success,<br />\ndespite the fact that they were<br />\njust minimal musicians. Very few<br />\nof us laughed at George<br />\nHarrison's awkward guitar lines,<br />\nRingo's pedestrian drumming, or<br />\nPaul McCartney's idealess bass<br />\nplaying, because the material<br />\nthey were being -applied to was so<br />\nsuperior.<br />\nAs for me, I was never too<br />\nfond of the Beatles for that<br />\n/reason, and for Songs In The Key<br />\nof Life, I would have liked more<br />\nfor the $13.98 list I've been<br />\nasked for.<br /><br />\nHate<br /><br />\nMarriage<br /><br />\nHere, kid, here's love.

Pancakes are just too syrupy for our tastes.<br />\nThe construction of the Union revitalized campus life the<br />\n.past two years. That. social renaissance came to a screeching<br />\nhalt with last spring's election of Messrs. Ponchak,<br />\nTannenblatt, Himelfarb, and company. Their dereliction of<br />\nduty has caused the Hopkins social scene to deteriorate to<br />\nthe point where one is limited to a trash movie in Shriver, a<br />\nthrilling night at the Rat, or an evening in front of the tube.<br />\nIn any case, that is a far cry from both the actions of the past<br />\nand the hollow promises made during last year's elections.<br />\nThe situation has reached the point where outsiders make<br />\nmore use of the Union's facilities than Hopkins students.<br />\nWe hope that this weekend's planned activities signal an<br />\nimprovement.lt looksas if the \"powers that be\" are beginning<br />\nto defrost from their six-week deep freeze and realize their<br />\nonly valuable function as elected student officials. Despite<br />\ntheir whines to the contrary the only legitimate function of<br />\nstudent leaders is to develop and organize activities which lift<br />\nstudents' noses out of the academic garbage pail. When even<br />\nthat meager task cannot be properly performed, it is time to<br />\nquestion the competence of those student officials.<br /><br />\nletters to the editor<br />\nTo the Editor:<br />\nI think many would agree that<br />\nthis years News-Letter has been a<br />\ngood one. Coverage of<br />\ncommunity events, Hopkins<br />\nsports, and campus issues has<br />\nbeen comprehensive. Yet, there<br />\nseems to be a noticeable gap in<br />\ncoverage of one are of Hopkins<br />\nlife (one which many consider an<br />\nintegral part of the university)<br />\nACADEMICS! Allow me to<br />\nillustrate exactly what I mean.<br />\n!. The Deans office in<br />\nHomewood House, in<br />\nconjunction with Omicron Delta<br />\nKappa offers a free tutoring<br />\nservice to students with probleTs<br />\nin specific areas. The News-Letter<br />\nhas been contacted about the<br />\nneed to publicize the program as<br />\na service to students but have not<br />\nresponded.<br />\n2. In mid-September, a campus<br />\nnote giving deadlines for the<br />\nRhodes, Marshall, Danforth, and<br />\nLuce Scholarships was sent to the<br />\nNews-Letter along with the<br />\nrequest that the notice appear<br />\nregularly until after the deadlines<br />\nhad passed. The notice has<br />\nappeared only twice. Instead, we<br /><br />\nhave been treated to the frequent<br />\nappearances of \"Academic<br />\nResearch Papers For Sale.\" When<br />\nthe unethical replaces the<br />\nessential, a reevaluation of<br />\npriorities is long overdue.<br />\n3. Along more general lines, it<br />\nseems to me that the Hopkins<br />\ncommunity would be more than<br />\ninterested in knowing the new<br />\nfaculty and visiting professors, as<br />\nwell as what the Academic<br />\nCouncil and CUS (Committee on<br />\nUndergraduate Studies) have<br />\nbeen doing.<br />\nThe News-Letter does have an<br />\nobligation to students, contrary<br />\nto what some may believe. The<br />\ndissemination of necessary<br />\nacademic information<br />\nthroughout the University is, in<br />\nmy opinion, a major part of that<br />\nobligation.

Four groups of walkers from<br />\nacross the country will converge<br />\nto protest \"the misplaced<br />\npriorities of the federal<br />\ngovernment.\"<br />\nConceived a year ago by the<br />\nWar Resisters League, the<br />\nContinental Walk focuses on the<br />\nbillions spent for nuclear<br />\nweapons and military programs<br />\nas schools, housing, hospitals,<br />\nand community services suffer<br />\nfrom a lack of funds. A<br />\ncoordinating committee in states<br />\nalong the four routes (started<br />\nfrom Boston, North Carolina,<br />\nNew Orleans, and San Francisco)<br />\nhas worked on setting up<br />\neducational forums, organizing<br />\ndemonstrations, and housing<br />\nwalkers in local areas.<br />\n\"Social change is not going to<br />\ncome through the media,\"<br />\nexplained Dave Pittman, a<br />\nmember of the Maryland<br />\nCommittee for the Continental<br />\nWalk. \"Long distance walking is a<br />\nsymbol of a slow, methodical<br />\nway of accomplishment. That's<br />\nthe kind of effort needed in local<br />\ncommunities if there's going to<br />\nbe social change.\"<br />\nPointing to the civil rights and<br />\npeace movements of the sixties,<br />\nthe Continental Walk stresses<br />\nthat power can be \"turned<br />\naround\" in America. The slow,<br />\ndeliberate philosophy of the<br />\nWalk reflects some experience<br />\neained from those movements.<br />\n\"More people have to be<br />\ninvolved in the decision-making<br />\nprocess about the Pentagon,\"<br />\nPittman said. \"Right now, people<br />\nare without a sense of power. Sid<br />\nLens suggested that there are two<br />\ntypes of government: one<br />\nanswers your request -for<br />\ninformation about guinea pigs in<br />\na nice,efficient manner; the other<br />\nmakes the decisions about nuclear<br />\nweapons, military expenditures<br />\nwhile closed off from the public.<br />\nYou only control the people you<br />\nelect, and it breaks down that<br />\ndecision-making rests with the<br />\nexecutive -- the President sets a<br />\ntone for the country. He sways<br />\nwhat goes on at the Pentagon.\"<br />\nThe Walk protestors plan to<br />\ngather at the Lincoln Memorial<br />\nMonday morning October 18 for<br />\na silent \"Procession of Death,\"<br />\nwhich will carry coffins to the<br /><br />\nPentagon steps. There is a<br />\npossibility that the State of<br />\nVirginia may deny the Walkers<br />\naccess to the bridges; in that case,<br />\ncertain acts of \"civil<br />\ndisobedience\" can be expected.<br />\nIn the afternoon, a return<br />\n\"Procession of Life\" will head<br />\nback into Washington with a list<br />\nof demands for the President.<br />\nThe demands are not \"utopian or<br />\nradical,\" according to a leaflet.<br />\n\"They are based on common<br />\nsense. Not one of them needs to<br />\nwait ten years for action. Each<br />\ncould be carried out by State and<br />\nFederal governments in the next<br />\nsix months.\"<br /><br />\nThe demands include items<br />\nlike an immediate halt in the<br />\nproduction of nuclear bombs,<br />\nwhile defusing existing nuclear<br />\nbombs; passage of the<br />\nHumphrey -Hawkins Full<br />\nEmployment Bill and Kennedy<br />\nHealth Bill; and a 25% cut in the<br />\nPentagon budget for the next<br />\nfiscal year, eliminating the B-1<br />\nbomber, I rident submarine, and<br />\nCruise Missile programs.<br />\nViolence<br />\ni he processions and list of<br />\ndemands will have, of course, no<br /><br />\nHEYI THAT'S CUTE!'<br /><br />\npractical effect on the operations<br />\nand the policies of the,<br />\ngovernment. \"That's a long<br />\nroad,\" Pittman commented,'<br />\n\"more than 3,000 miles. You've<br />\ngot to start at different levels.<br />\nViolence in the neighborhoods<br />\nstarts five feet away and spreads<br />\noutward.\" The long process<br />\ninvolves a \"lifetime commitment.<br />\nPeople in Appalachia are not<br />\ninterested in short-timers, the<br />\nvolunteers from the Peace Corps<br />\nor Vista.\"<br />\nAs a local flyer states, \"the<br />\nsimple act of walking from<br />\ncommunity to community is a<br />\npowerful symbol that the<br />\nrealization of great goals is<br />\nreached slowly, and that so<br />\nfundamental a change as we<br />\ndemand begins in our<br />\nneighborhoods and at our<br />\nworkplaces.\"<br />\nWhen the walkers meet on<br />\nSaturday the 16th, joined by<br />\nthousands of others, they will<br />\ncombine for three days of<br />\ndemonstrations, rallies, a peace<br />\nand justice fair, and music. A<br />\n2p.m. rally Saturday at the<br />\nSylvan Theater will have Ralph<br />\nAbernathy, Daniel Ellsberg, and<br />\nDave Dellinger, and a number of<br />\nother speakers.<br />\nAs for Baltimore activities, the<br />\nWalk enters the city Monday,<br />\nwith stops at Morgan State and<br />\nHopkins. Ellsberg will speak at<br />\n8:00 in Shrive: Hall, sponsored<br />\nby the Committee for the<br />\nConversion of the Applied<br />\nPhysics Lab.<br />\nOn Tuesday, a morning rally<br />\nand street theater on<br />\nGreenmount and 31st Street will<br />\nlead into a walk downtown for<br />\nan afternoon meeting at<br />\nLexington Market. LIMBC will<br />\nrun continuous showings of<br />\n\"Hearts and Minds\" through the<br />\nday. Meanwhile, Mayor Schaefer<br />\nhas declined a proposed meeting<br />\nwith the demonstrators at War<br />\nMemorial Plaza.<br />\nThe Walkers, including fifteen<br />\nwho will have covered the 550<br />\nmiles from Boston, will then<br />\nhead toward Washington, with a<br />\nstop Thursday at the APL. \"The<br />\none word to characterize the<br />\nWalk is hope,\" Pittman said. \"As<br />\npeople look back on the sixties,<br />\nthey realize that the anti-war and<br />\ncivil rights efforts paid off.\"<br />\nNow, as the Maryland committee<br />\nproposes,\"the Walk asks that we<br />\npush disarmament to the top of<br />\npublic agenda and dedicate<br />\nourselves to the nonviolent<br />\nstruggle for social justice.'<br /><br />\n\"The time has come,\" the walrus said,. \"To talk of many things:<br /><br />\n--.of cabbages--and kings-Ofshoes--and ships--and sealing wax,<br /><br />\nAnd why one sea is boiling hot\u2022<br /><br />\nand whether pigs have wings.\"<br /><br />\n--Lewis Carroll<br />\nPhotos<br /><br />\nby<br /><br />\nJennifer Bishop<br /><br />\nAutomotive re-cycling: Living off the waste of the land<br />\nBy GEORGE DORNER<br />\nThere's an underground of<br />\nprimitive urban ecologists at<br />\nwork in Baltimore.

Several of these injuries<br />\nare of a temporary nature and<br />\nthose athletes should be<br />\nreturning to active duty in the<br />\nnext few weeks, but at least three<br />\nplayers have been sidelined for<br />\nthe remainder of the season.<br />\nThe latter group includes Dave<br />\nGreisler, George Skegas and<br />\nScott Smith\u2014men who figured<br />\nProminently in .the plans of head<br />\ncoach Dennis Cox. Greisler, a<br />\nstarting offensive tackle, received<br />\na concussion several weeks ago<br />\nand has had to sit out for the<br />\nseason, while Smith and Skegas<br />\nboth sustained knee injuries that<br />\nhave forced them to hang up<br />\ntheir cleats for this year.<br />\nAmong the players who expect<br />\nto be out for Saturday's contest<br />\nbut return before season's end<br />\nare senior co-captain Brett Miles,<br /><br />\nThe Bears also have a new<br />\ncoach, but he has met with little<br />\nsuccess so far this year. His<br />\nteam's record stands at 0-3<br />\nfollowing consecutive losses to<br />\nWestern Maryland, F and M and<br />\nLebanon Valley.<br />\nCoach Cox considers this game<br />\nimportant if the Jays are to<br />\nrebound from their poor start.<br />\n\"Previous football teams at<br />\nHopkins have been at this point<br />\n(0-2) before and have come back<br />\nto win six games,\" the Coach<br />\nreminded. \"I've really been<br />\npleased with our team this year<br />\nand a win Saturday would help<br />\nus an awful lot.\u2014<br /><br />\nHopkins' QB Tom Bender (12)passes us.

He was<br />\nborn in a small town outside the<br />\nmajor city of Tel.

You begin to play as<br />\nsoon as you are able to walk.\"<br />\n\"In Israel,\" he said, \"the<br />\nprogram is much more<br />\nrigorous\u2014much more seems to be<br />\nat stake. Most times a coach's<br />\nactual life depends on whether<br />\nhis team wins or loses.

It is hoped that<br />\nextra \"push\" in the fall will aid<br />\nthe Jays in the spring.<br />\nAlthough it is too early to tell<br />\nhow his team will perform,<br />\nCiccarone felt the stickwork has<br />\nshown improvement since<br />\npractice has started. The \"hustle<br />\nand aggressiveness\" have really<br />\nimpressed the coach and he<br />\nsenses that the players \"are<br />\nhungrier this year\" than at this<br />\npoint in previous years.<br />\nCiccarone also added that \"we<br />\nwill be much more aggressive in<br />\nthe spring.\" He explained the<br />\nJays won't go out of their way to<br />\nmake contact but will employ it<br />\nin appropriate situations.<br />\nIt appears the Jays did a good<br />\njob of recruiting this year. Not<br />\nmentioning any specific names of<br />\nthese new players, Ciccarone said<br />\nthat three middies, four<br />\nat t ackmen, three defensemen,<br />\nand a goalie all have chances to<br />\nmake significant contributions to<br />\nthe fall squad. He also said, \"Five<br />\nfrosh are first line ballplayers and<br />\nshould help the team in the<br />\nspring.\"<br />\nThe remaining opponents on<br />\nthe Jays' fall schedule all appear<br />\nformidable. On Sunday Oct. 10<br />\nat 1:00 p.m. they host the<br />\nUniversity of North Carolina on<br />\nHomewood Field, while they<br />\nencounter the University of<br />\nDelaware at 4:00 p.m. on Oct. 13<br />\non Garland Field.

I am still<br />\nnot fully adjusted to this life.\"<br />\nLevin has not shown any lack<br />\nof adjust ment on the field,<br />\nthough. In a recent game with<br />\n1J rsinus, the lineman scored two<br />\ngoals.<br />\nMarty Wolf hails from here in<br />\nBaltimore City.

It is<br />\nplayed at a faster and more<br />\nphysical pace than in high<br />\nichool.\"<br /><br />\nUpon arriving on the soccer<br />\nscene at Hopkins. Marty also<br />\nfound some difficulty in<br />\nadjustment. Yet he contends that<br /><br />\nthe advantages of being a<br />\nfreshman on the varsity squad<br />\noutweigh the disadvantages.<br />\n\"As a freshman,\" he said,<br />\n\"you know that you have four<br />\nfull years to attain the certain<br />\ngoals you set for yourself in this<br />\ngame.\"<br />\nPlaying strong midfielder for<br />\nthe Jays \\l arty has scored twice<br />\nthis year, and has set up many<br />\nother goals.<br />\nAcademically, Chaim is an<br />\n;Itternational studies major and<br />\nMarty is a psychology major.<br />\nBoth men would like to attend<br />\nlaw school after they graduate<br />\n'rout JHU.<br />\nOther freshmen presently<br />\n, caring varsity soccer uniforms<br />\ninclude back Ed Vance and<br />\nieserve goalie, George Coutros.<br />\nThe team travels to Carlisle,<br />\nPa. tomorrow to face the .Red<br />\n-Devils of Dickinson 'College.

The game is open to the<br />\nPublic and there will be no<br />\nadmission fee.<br />\nThe Blue Jay fall squad has<br />\nnow been practicing 3 times a<br />\nWeek for several weeks and,<br />\naccording to Head Coach Henry<br />\nCiccarone, \"The main goal of fall<br />\nlacrosse is to indoctrinate the<br />\nfreshmen and orient them to our<br />\nSystem\"<br />\nAny previous follower of fall<br />\nlacrosse at Hopkins would notice<br />\na stepped-up program from the<br />\nPast. Ciccarone explained the<br />\nChange saying, \"The main reason<br />\nfor this is to have our guys in<br />\nbetter condition to avoid injuries<br />\nWe had last year.\" He referred<br />\nSpecifically to midfielder George<br />\nJohnson and former<br />\nAll-American attackman Richie<br />\nHirsch. Both sustained shoulder<br />\ninjuries during fall lacrosse last<br />\nYear and performed at less than<br />\ntheir potential this past spring.<br />\nCiccarone's own feelings have<br />\nmuch to do with the accelerated<br />\nfall program.<br />\n\"I feel more geared up this<br />\nYear to do better than in the<br />\nPast,\" he commented.
