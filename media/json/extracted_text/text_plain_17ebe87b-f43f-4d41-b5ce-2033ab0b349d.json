There is no needless interference<br />\non the part of the authorities. There is no<br />\nwatching or supervising, no gating,\" or shutting in of students at an early evening hour, as<br />\nin an English college. In Edinburgh a<br />\nstudent-lodger, as in America, has his own<br />\npass-key and comes or goes when he likes. A<br />\nCollege Hall in Scotland is managed very<br />\nmuch like an American City Club or College<br />\nFraternity House. The Hall chooses its own<br />\nofficers. A house committee has general<br />\ncharge of all matters of interior concern. Only<br />\nthose students are received as members who<br />\nare approved or elected. Any obnoxious member may be disciplined or expelled.<br />\nThe<br />\nCharges made for rooms, which are furnished<br />\nwith all things needful, are according to location. The cost of board is assessed pro rata<br />\nupon the members of the common mess, exactly as in old-fashioned student commons, or<br />\ndining clubs, at Harvard and Yale.<br />\nIn the Scotch, as well as in the English colleges, a visitor is impressed with the good administration and efficient household service.<br />\nThere is a well-developed spirit of social unity<br />\nand good fellowship. In these points our<br />\nAmerican dormitory system at boys' schools<br />\nand men's colleges is, in most cases, weak. The<br />\nservice and management are usually bad. Our<br />\nAmerican colleges for women are far superior<br />\nto the old-fashioned dormitories for men. At<br />\nSmith and Bryn Mawr, as in English and<br />\nScotch colleges, you will find common diningrooms and common parlors in the buildings<br />\nwhere students lodge. This, of course, promotes sociability, and the common life, which,<br />\nin men's colleges, is too often relegated to the<br />\n<br />\nNo. 4<br />\n<br />\nfraternity house, the gymnasium, the \"cage,\"<br />\nor the ball field. To this general rule there are<br />\nwholesome exceptions a t Lawrenceville,<br />\nWorcester Free Academy, Rutger's College,<br />\nTrinity College, N. C., and other places.<br />\n\u2022 The experience of Oxford, Cambridge and<br />\nEdinburgh Universities has shown the possibility of good social organization in dormitories and of a real common life in large academic towns, where the individual, unless living in some college, is in danger of isolation<br />\nand a more or less hermit mode of existence.<br />\nEspecially in Edinburgh has the institution of<br />\nUniversity Halls, on Castle Hill, socialized and<br />\nunified the hitherto separate and scattered elements of the great student body. It is both<br />\nfeasible and desirable in American college<br />\ntowns to bring together, in the form of Students' Unions, little bands of congenial spirits,<br />\nwho can form social clubs, or open fraternities,<br />\nto which desirable members may be gradually<br />\nelected, upon a broad and liberal plan. The<br />\nupper rooms of the club-house, as in our present fraternity houses, should be rented to members. There should be a common room, or<br />\nparlor, and a dining-room on the first floor, a<br />\nclub cuisine in the basement, and bathrooms in<br />\nall the upper stories. A club mess can easily be<br />\nsustained by residents and boarders under the<br />\ndirection of a student manager or steward,<br />\nwho should cater for the club mess and regulate expenses according to the wishes of its patrons. The business affairs of the club, the<br />\nelection of new members, the collection of<br />\nrents, dues, etc., should be in charge of a house<br />\ncommittee. This kind of administration is well<br />\nunderstood in some of our American College<br />\nFraternities, but it needs social extension and<br />\nacademic popularization.<br />\nIn the Scotch College Hall at Ramsay Garden I was greatly impressed with the interior<br />\nart decorations. As you ascend the winding<br />\nstairways, you find the walls beautifully<br />\n<br />\n\f2<br />\n<br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\n<br />\nadorned with hundreds of photographs of Old<br />\nEdinburgh buildings. Modern improvements<br />\nin the \"Old Town\" on the hill have caused<br />\nthe removal of many ancient landmarks and<br />\nhistoric monuments, architectural facades and<br />\npicturesque courts, or ancient \"wyndes,\"<br />\nwhich were once the artist's and tourist's delight. You will now find them all preserved in<br />\nartistic ways, by drawings and photographs on<br />\nthe staircases of the College Hall at Ramsay<br />\nGarden. In the common room of this hall the<br />\nwalls are artistically frescoed to represent certain scenes in Celtic mythology. There is an<br />\nearnest attempt every year at the Edinburgh<br />\nSummer School to revive old Celtic decorative<br />\nart, of which a pleasing exhibition is made on<br />\nacademic premises and in prints and publications.<br />\nEdinburgh is a wonderfully beautiful town,<br />\na queenly city, a modern Athens, set upon hills,<br />\nwith broad thoroughfares, noble monuments<br />\nand public buildings, lovely gardens, extensive<br />\nparks and drives, magnificent outlooks towards<br />\nthe mountains and across the Firth of Forth.<br />\nBut some idea of what the condition of the<br />\ntown once was can be obtained by glancing at<br />\nthe squalid \"survivals\" of filth and misery<br />\nin \"Cowgate\" and other old-time streets and<br />\nalleys in which now dwell \"the submerged<br />\ntenth,\" apparently sunken below the present<br />\nlevel of the city, whose traffic and modern<br />\npromenades are more conspicuously seen<br />\nalong those gigantic causeways which cross the<br />\nold historic ravines or gullies of Edinburgh.<br />\nIn the newest art gallery of the city you will<br />\nfind in an upper room a large collection of<br />\nsketches and water colors, showing Old Edinburgh in all its picturesque squalor. Almost<br />\nevery bit of quaint architecture, every nook and<br />\ncorner of the ancient town, is thus immortalized by the faithful hand of art ; but we must<br />\nremember that those old rookeries on High<br />\nstreet and Canongate, while interesting to look<br />\nat, were not sanitary places of abode. As Robert Louis Stevenson says : \"It is easy to be a<br />\nconservator of the discomforts of others. . . .<br />\nAssuredly, in driving streets through the black<br />\nlabyrinth, a few curious old corners have been<br />\nswept away, and some associations turned out<br />\n<br />\nof house and home. But what slices of sunlight, what breaths of clean of air, have been<br />\nlet in I And what a picturesque world remains<br />\nuntouched I\"<br />\nWhoever visits Edinburgh will be grateful<br />\nto the memory of Robert Louis Stevenson, and<br />\nwill read and re-read his \"Picturesque Notes\"<br />\non this fascinating old city. No writer has better caught the spirit of the place or sketched its<br />\nsalient features with a truer hand. The visitor<br />\nwill surely encounter this genius loci, Robert<br />\nLouis Stevenson, in the National Portrait Gallery of Edinburgh, where a marble bust of the<br />\ncharming author of \"St. Ives\" greets you<br />\nwith an almost life-like welcome. The man<br />\ntruly lives in literature and in art. The following brief extracts from his \"Picturesque Notes\"<br />\ndescribe Edinburgh :<br />\n\"Few places, if any,\" he says, \"offer a more<br />\nbarbaric display of contrasts to the eye. In the<br />\nvery midst stands one of the most satisfactory<br />\ncrags in nature\u2014a bass rock upon dry land,<br />\nrooted in a garden, shaken by passing trains,<br />\ncarrying a crown of battlements and turrets,<br />\nand describing its warlike shadow over the<br />\nliveliest and brightest thoroughfare of the New<br />\nTown. From their smoky beehives, ten stories<br />\nhigh, the unwashed look down upon the open<br />\nsquares and gardens of the wealthy ; and gay<br />\npeople sunning themselves along Princes<br />\nstreet, with its mile of commercial palaces beflagged upon some great occasion, see, across a<br />\ngardened valley set with statues, where the<br />\nwashings of the old town flutter in the breeze<br />\nat its high windows. And then, upon all sides,<br />\nwhat a clashing of architecture I In this one<br />\nvalley, where the life of the town goes most<br />\nbusily forward, there may be seen, shown one<br />\nabove and behind another by the accidents of<br />\nthe ground, buildings in almost every style<br />\nupon the globe. Egyptian and Greek temples,<br />\nVenetian palaces and Gothic spires, are huddled one over another in a most admired disorder; while, above all, the brute mass of the<br />\nCastle and the summit of Arthur's Seat look<br />\ndown upon these imitations with a becoming<br />\ndignity, as the works of Nature may look down<br />\nupon the monuments of Art.\"<br />\nHERBERT B. ADAMS.<br />\n<br />\n\fTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\nDR. T11-1011AS.<br />\n<br />\nDr. James Carey Thomas was born in Baltimore on July II, 1833, and died on November<br />\n9, 1897. He graduated from Haverford College in 1852, and from the Medical School of<br />\nthe University of Maryland in 1854. He was<br />\na trustee of the Johns Hopkins University from<br />\nits opening until his death.<br />\nHis efficient, faithful and devoted work in<br />\nmany lines is known to all men. He was a<br />\nphysician in the active practice of that arduous<br />\nprofession, a minister of the 'Gospel in the Society of Friends, a public-spirited philanthropist, keenly interested in every plan for the improvement of his fellowman ; an officer and a<br />\nzealous supporter of the Young Men's Christian Association in this city, and a trustee of<br />\nseveral important educational institutions.<br />\nThis is not the place to write of these manifold<br />\nfields of activity. But it is eminently fitting that<br />\nreference should be made in THE NEWS-LETTER to another side of Dr. Thomas' activity to<br />\nwhich he gave much time, thought and love\u2014<br />\nhis relations to the Johns Hopkins University.<br />\nOnly the trustees can tell how valuable his<br />\nservices were in the organization and development of the University in general, and of the<br />\nMedical School in particular; but certain of<br />\nDr. Thomas' services were such as could be<br />\nseen even by those who came here as students,<br />\nand still more clearly by those who remained<br />\nas instructors, after the conclusion of their<br />\ncourse of studies for a degree.<br />\nFirst of all, he stood for a broad and courageous Christianity in the University. Other<br />\nmen might doubt as to the position of Christianity in the mind of an educated man or in the<br />\nlife of an educational institution ; but we felt<br />\nthat in him we knew one who never hesitated<br />\nin his firm insistence on the greatest freedom<br />\nof scientific research and on the certainty and<br />\nimportance of the Christian religion. None<br />\nShould be ignorantly religious; none should<br />\nbe learned infidels \u2014all should be educated<br />\nChristians. With such convictions, he was a<br />\nmost eager and consistent supporter of everything which tended to make the religious life<br />\nmore vital to the students.<br />\n<br />\n3<br />\n<br />\nAnother service, rendered by Dr. Thomas to<br />\nthe University, came from his broad culture.<br />\nHe was the member of the Board of Trustees<br />\nwith whom (next to President Gilman) the students most frequently came in contact, and in<br />\nhim we found the true University spirit. He<br />\nhad none of that narrow specialization into<br />\nwhich professional men are so liable to fall ;<br />\nnone of that distortion of perspective which<br />\nmakes the science studied by you so important<br />\nand those studied by others so insignificant. In<br />\nhim we knew a man whose outlook was over a<br />\nwide field. He was a truly liberal man. Liberality has been defined as \"breadth on high levels,\" and it seems to me that Dr. Thomas' life<br />\nfulfilled that definition. Shallowness was as<br />\nforeign to him as narrowness. His breadth<br />\nwas that of the deep and mighty ocean.<br />\nFinally, his life was one of great influence on<br />\nHopkins men because of its kindliness, purity<br />\nand lovableness. One could not meet him without a friendly word. To chat with him was to<br />\ncatch an inspiration to effort, which lingered<br />\nlong after the conversation was finished. He<br />\nwas so cheerful, so buoyant and hopeful in his<br />\nview of life, so filled with brotherly kindness,<br />\nand his face was so turned towards those things<br />\nthat are pure and lovely, that his presence was<br />\na benediction. Good was it for so many of us<br />\nthat we knew him,and good was it for the University that his influence was so long manifested and so potent here.<br />\nBERNARD C. STEINER.<br />\n<br />\nA meeting of the class of '99 was held on<br />\nWednesday, November 3. The financial situation of the class was discussed and an assessment made. Mr. Dieffenbach addressed the<br />\nmeeting in behalf of The '98 Hullabaloo. The<br />\nclass voted an appropriation of $20 to The Hullabaloo.

The debaters displayed<br />\ngreater self-possession, and were, therefore,<br />\nmore effective. The side which affirmed that<br />\nthe \"silver question\" was now a dead issue, represented by Senators Fisher, R. D. Miller and<br />\nFitzgerald, won by an overwhelming majority.<br />\nSenators Fisher and Miller were heartily applauded. The open discussion was participated<br />\nin by Senators Ballard and Miller. The meeting was honored by the presence of Professor<br />\nAdams, who afterwards gave a favorable criticism of the debate. His advice to the speakers<br />\nis to write down their address, as an effective<br />\nmethod of impressing it on the memory, but to<br />\nuse no notes in speaking, as it is most important to be independent in the delivery.<br />\nThe subject for the next debate is : Shall<br />\nthe United States intervene in behalf of Cuba?\"<br />\nSenators Seth, Clark and Pender will take the<br />\naffirmative; Senators Ulman, Stearns and<br />\nHammond 'the negative. President Gilman<br />\nwill probably be present as the guest of the<br />\nSenate.<br />\nThe third regular meeting of the House of<br />\nRepresentatives was held Wednesday, October<br />\n10, in the Donovan room, McCoy ,Hall. Dr.<br />\nAdams was the guest of the House. The subject debated was: \"Resolved, That the result<br />\nof the work of the United States Bimetallic<br />\nMonetary 'Commission ought definitely to settle the silver question.\" The affirmative side<br />\nwas taken by Congressmen Greenbaum, Fosnocht and Frank; the negative side by Congressmen Gaddess, Levering and Kalb. The<br />\nquestion was very ably debated, and the arguments were effective, especially those of Fosnocht, Levering and Frank. The House took<br />\na very active part in the open discussion. Dr.<br />\nAdams, at the request of the House, spoke a<br />\nfew words. He complimented both the debaters and the House on their able discussion of<br />\nthe question. The subject for debate at the next<br />\n<br />\nmeeting of the House will be : \"Resolved, That<br />\nthe United States should intervene in behalf of<br />\nCuba.\" The affirmative side will be taken by<br />\nCongressmen Chambers, Bruce and Ramsay;<br />\nthe negative side by Congressmen Fisher, Ross<br />\nand Guggenheimer.

REID'S TRIP.<br />\n<br />\nTHE LECTURES ON JAPAN.<br />\n<br />\nDr. H. F. Reid returned from his summer's<br />\ntrip on Wednesday November 17. He left<br />\nBaltimore on June 12, and spent some weeks<br />\ntaking measurements on the Forno glacier in<br />\nthe Engadin, together with Professor Ames.<br />\nFrom Switzerland he went to Russia, to take<br />\npart in an extensive journey of geologists<br />\nacross the Ural as far as the Western terminus<br />\nof the Great Siberian road. After this he<br />\nmet Dr. Clark at St. Petersburg, took part in<br />\nthe Congress, and then joined in a special trip<br />\nto Mt. Elbrux in the Caucasus.<br />\nIn the first days of October an excursion was<br />\nmade to Mt. Ararat. Mr. E. Stoeber, who ascended the greater Ararat, together with Dr.<br />\nEbeling, of Berlin, and Dr. Oswald, of Bale,<br />\nseparated from his companions. They gained<br />\nthe summit, were forced to spend the night at<br />\nan altitude of 16,000 feet, suffering much from<br />\ncold, and returned to the Cossack camp next<br />\nday. There they learned that Stoeber had not<br />\nreturned. An instant search after the lost man<br />\nwas rendered fruitless through a violent snowstorm and through the men's inability to speak<br />\nRussian with the Cossacks. After many difficulties and unavoidable delays, a party composed of Dr. Ebeling, Dr. Oswald and Dr.<br />\nReid continued the search until October 4,<br />\nwhen some Cossacks found Stoeber's body. He<br />\nhad evidently slipped on a ledge of rocks and<br />\nbroken his leg. The cold had killed him before<br />\nhe recovered consciousness. The accident was<br />\nentirely due to Stoeber's inexperience in<br />\nmountaineering.<br />\nDr. Reid returned by way of Odessa, Constantinople and Athens, and through the Mediterranean to Switzerland. At Crete he saw the<br />\nassembled fleet of the powers, and also their<br />\ntroops, which were stationed at Canea. One<br />\nfortress was flying the colors of nearly all the<br />\nEuropean nations.<br />\nHe also ascended Mt.<br />\nStromboli, a well-known volcano in the Lipari<br />\nIslands, but was disappointed in not finding<br />\nit in activity. In Switzerland he took final<br />\nmeasurements on the Forno glacier.<br />\n<br />\nA series of remarkable lectures on \"Modern<br />\nJapan\" was given during the past week. Dr.<br />\nDavid Murray lectured on \"Education in<br />\nJapan ;\" Professor Mits4kuri gave an account<br />\nof \"Recent Changes in Japan\" and of the \"University of Tokio,\" and Mr. Rokuro Nakaseko,<br />\none of our graduates in chemistry, gave some<br />\ncharming and realistic glimpses of modern<br />\nJapan.<br />\nBy request of Prof. Brooks, Prof. Mitsukuri spoke before the instructors and students of the Biological Department on Thursday morning, November 18. His interesting<br />\nreminiscences and amusing anecdotes of his<br />\nstudent days at the Johns Hopkins afforded a<br />\nstriking illustration for President Gilman's definition of an university as a\"societas magistrorum ct discipulorum.\" Dr. Sedgwick and Dr.<br />\nWilson were fellow students with Dr. Mitsukuri. Dr. Howell was then an undergraduate<br />\nand worked with him in physiology. Professor<br />\nMartin and Professor Brooks were the chief instructors of these men. Since then all have<br />\nbecome famous, and have spread abroad the<br />\nlearning derived from our University.

Adams,on \"Student Life<br />\nin Edinburgh.\" In this description of customs<br />\nat the University of Edinburgh, Dr. Adams has<br />\nbrought up a point which merits the thoughtful attention of every member of our University\u2014the existence, namely, of co-operative<br />\ncollege halls.<br />\nA distinguished guest of the University\u2014Sir<br />\nMichael Foster\u2014has recently said that one<br />\nchief source of strength with us lies in the fact<br />\nthat our University is still young enough to be<br />\nmoulded\u2014that there are no iron-bound \"precedents\" to hinder us from developing along<br />\nthe lines of latest improvement, or from adopting unto ourselves the best features of all other<br />\neducational systems.<br />\nIf we accept this theory of constant improvement by selection as our creed\u2014and we could<br />\nnot wish for a better one\u2014then it behooves us<br />\nto consider carefully this system, only recently<br />\ninaugurated at a great sister university, yet already markedly successful there. Until a few<br />\nyears since, Edinburgh had been, like our-<br />\n<br />\nselves, destitute of any real student life; she<br />\nlacked that side of education which does not<br />\ncome to us from books or lectures, but rather<br />\nis absorbed by living in an atmosphere created<br />\nby a number of cultivated men and earnest<br />\nworkers. Now this void has been filled by the<br />\nmembers of the University themselves, and college halls have sprung up and are flourishing<br />\non the co-operative plan, and without any outside backing.<br />\nThat such a system, if adopted here, would<br />\nprove successful, is likely. That it is needed is<br />\nunquestionable. Students\u2014especially those<br />\nseeking a doctor's degree\u2014are all too prone,<br />\nabsorbed in their own special line of work, to<br />\nforget that duty toward self as an individual, as<br />\nwell as a unit of social humanity, demands of<br />\nthem a general and broadening cultivation as<br />\nan antidote to the narrowing effect of specializing. Again, who,of all these workers scattered<br />\nthroughout the city in boarding houses, has not<br />\nfelt that strain upon the will, greater than any<br />\nstrain of study, which results from sticking to<br />\nwork, day by day, monotonously, with hardly<br />\na taste of outside life to relieve the tension?<br />\nAnd,suffering this strain of lonely self-dependence, would he not draw fresh vigor and enthusiasm from an atmosphere of work and<br />\nearnest purpose, and from the society of cultivated men, come together in the common<br />\nroom of the hall for a little rest and chatting<br />\nafter breakfast or at the end of the day's work?<br />\nSuch a stimulus is dwelt upon in all stories<br />\nand descriptions of English university life,<br />\nwhere this system of halls is in use ; and<br />\nit is of only less value than that broadening of character and rubbing away of<br />\nangles which results from the contact of<br />\nman with his fellow-men. And then there<br />\nis the other side, more interesting to undergraduates, perhaps, than to graduates, yet of<br />\nimportance to both \u2014 the fellowship among<br />\nstudents which this system would foster and<br />\nthe friendships, to whose formation it would<br />\nstand sponsor. All these features\u2014quite as<br />\nimportant in their results as the college work\u2014<br />\nbelong to some extent to the fraternities. But<br />\ntheir scope is limited. The four hundred and<br />\n<br />\n\f0E44<br />\n<br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\n<br />\nI<br />\n<br />\n1<br />\n<br />\nodd members of the University whose homes<br />\nare out of the city prove the need, while they<br />\nargue the practicability of such a system.<br />\nLast year, at the outset of its career, the<br />\nNEWS-LETTER outlined two wants as being<br />\nmost pressing at the University, and pledged<br />\nits aid in supplying them. They were, better<br />\nathletic facilities, and more college life. Since<br />\nthen the first of these wants has been filled.<br />\nWith gratification we realize that a new spirit<br />\nhas pervaded the whole University from Dan<br />\nto Beersheba, from students even unto trustees, and that it has shown itself in the erection<br />\nof a cage and the search for a field for our athletes. The second want was for a more mature and definite form of college life. And<br />\nthis, too, bids fair to be realized. It is shown<br />\nin the sentiment against the silly forms of hazing formerly practiced here, as well as in the<br />\nestablishment of a college congress. And<br />\nnow, may we not hope that in some future time,<br />\nwhether near or dim, these halls, which will do<br />\nthe most of all toward furthering true academic<br />\nlife, may be embodied in our University? It<br />\nis, at least, a pleasant dream to construct them<br />\nin fancy. There might be one for medical students, lying conveniently half way between the<br />\nHospital buildings on Broadway, and the Laboratories clustered around McCoy Hall ; another for the graduates and members of the<br />\nfaculty, a third for undergraduates\u2014all threads<br />\nof a web which would bring together the scattered lives of our students--which would bring<br />\nabout what Dr. Adams calls \"the real unity of<br />\nacademic life\u2014a college centre where students<br />\nlive and educate one another in their own society\u2014perhaps the most effective of all academic means of culture.\" Of course, these<br />\nhalls will not spring into existence spontaneously. But it is possible here, as was the<br />\ncase in Edinburgh, for a dozen or so students<br />\nto club together and<br />\nmake a beginning. And<br />\nfrom this beginning the development of the<br />\nsystem should be but a question of time.<br />\nFOOTBALL.<br />\n<br />\n.t<br />\nd<br />\n<br />\nWith the St. John's game our football season<br />\nPractically closed, as the game with the Baltimore Medical College was regarded as of little<br />\n<br />\n9<br />\n<br />\nimportance by Hopkins men, and was played<br />\nwith enough substitutes to cost us the game.<br />\nThe victory over our old rivals on Thanksgiving, however, left a very sweet taste in our<br />\nmouths, and considerable credit is due the team<br />\nfor the hard practice and plucky playing which<br />\ngave us the victory.<br />\nThere are, however, one or two lessons to be<br />\nlearned from the past season which are worth<br />\npointing out. One is, that it is as impossible<br />\nas it is unfair to expect the athletic reputation<br />\nof a university with nearly six hundred students to be adequately sustained by the almost<br />\nunsupported exertions of an undergraduate<br />\nbody amounting to scarcely one-fourth of the<br />\nwhole. There is enough good material in the<br />\ngraduate and medical departments to furnish<br />\nthe 'Varsity with teams which would place her<br />\non the level where she rightly belongs; but this<br />\nmaterial seems quite impossible to be reached.<br />\nOccasionally a \"grad.\" tries for the team, and<br />\nalmost invariably makes it if he practices. But<br />\neven this is but the exception which proves<br />\nthe rule.<br />\nThe other point is the impossibility of getting the best results out of what material we<br />\nhave, without adequate grounds and regular<br />\ncoaching. This was emphasized by the improvement in the team after Mr. Bond took it<br />\nin hand. On the whole, however, the result<br />\nhas been encouraging, and with a cage and an<br />\nathletic field we may indulge in a good many<br />\n\"hopes\" for better results next year.<br />\nCLIPPINGS.<br />\n<br />\n\"I wonder,\" said the philosophical student,<br />\n\"why a fight is called a scrap ?\"<br />\n\"Because it is a broken peace,\" replied the<br />\nCheerful Idiot, with his usual promptitude.\u2014<br />\nExchange.<br />\n\"Nothing won\" ('oi), is the remark of the<br />\ncolleges, after admitting the freshman class this<br />\nyear.\u2014Exchange.<br />\nThere was a time when every wheelman you<br />\nmet on the road was a gentleman ; now it is<br />\nhard to tell whether it is a gentleman or a<br />\nlady.\u2014Baltimore Life.<br />\n<br />\n\fTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\n<br />\n10<br />\n<br />\nATHLETICS.<br />\nFOOTBALL.<br />\n<br />\n25 yards down the field and across the line.<br />\nHodges kicked goal.

The 'Varsity team put up<br />\na good showing in<br />\nthe first half, scoring one<br />\ntouchdown. In the second half the weight of<br />\nthe College told upon<br />\nour men, and a touchdown was made by the College. The game<br />\nended in a dispute. When the kick for goal<br />\nwas being tried, the captain ran up and<br />\nhandled<br />\n<br />\nthe ball, putting it in play. Our men naturally<br />\ntook advantage of this, and carried the ball to<br />\nthe centre of the field. The College team did<br />\nnot look upon this in the same light as the<br />\n'Varsity did, and refused to play. The referee<br />\ndecided Hopkins' view correct, and Walter<br />\nCamp wrote to Captain Robinson that the decision of the referee is final.<br />\nHOCKEY.<br />\n<br />\nThe prospects for a good hockey team this<br />\nyear are unusually bright. This is proven not<br />\nonly by the large number of candidates, but<br />\nalso by their enthusiasm and determination.<br />\nThis season will witness a notable change in<br />\nthe choosing of the team, as well as of methods<br />\nand style in play. The chief feature of the new<br />\narrangement will be the presence of two teams,<br />\none following Hopkins' attack method and the<br />\nother the various styles of plays pursued by<br />\nother teams. In this manner weak points can<br />\nbe strengthened and faults remedied.<br />\nNo man on the team can feel secure of his<br />\nplace, for a substitute may at any time replace<br />\na regular if by his playing the \"sub\" proves his<br />\ncapability of strengthening that position.

Professor<br />\nClark stated that between 200 and 300 square<br />\nmiles in Western Maryland, chiefly in Allegany<br />\ncounty, had been topographically surveyed in<br />\nco-operation with the United States Geological Survey ; that the magnetic work had been<br />\nfurther extended, several additional county<br />\ntowns asking for the co-operation of the State<br />\nsurvey in establishing meridian lines, while all<br />\nthe magnetic and astronomical work for the<br />\nWestern Boundary Survey had also been<br />\nplaced under the supervision of the State Geologist ; that the work inaugurated the previous<br />\nyear upon the building stones of the State had<br />\nbeen practically brought to a conclusion, and<br />\nthe preparation of the manuscript of the report<br />\nwas already well advanced; that detailed geological surveys had been made of Allegany<br />\nand Garrett counties and portions of Cecil,<br />\nKent and Anne Arundel counties ; that the<br />\nstudy of the agricultural soils in their relations<br />\nto geology had been carried on in the same<br />\ncounties, and finally that much preliminary<br />\nwork along various lines of investigation had<br />\nbeen taken up in various portions of the State.<br />\nProfessor Clark also informed the board regarding his recent attendance upon the International Geological 'Congress at St. Petersburg, where he had been sent by appointment<br />\n<br />\nL-<br />\n<br />\nof the Governor to represent the State as State<br />\nGeologist.<br />\nAfter the discussion of plans for future work,<br />\nthe members of the Commission examined the<br />\nlarge collections which have been brought together under the auspices of the Survey.<br />\nALWINI NOTES.<br />\n<br />\nR.

There is no needless interference<br />\non the part of the authorities. There is no<br />\nwatching or supervising, no gating,\" or shutting in of students at an early evening hour, as<br />\nin an English college. In Edinburgh a<br />\nstudent-lodger, as in America, has his own<br />\npass-key and comes or goes when he likes. A<br />\nCollege Hall in Scotland is managed very<br />\nmuch like an American City Club or College<br />\nFraternity House. The Hall chooses its own<br />\nofficers. A house committee has general<br />\ncharge of all matters of interior concern. Only<br />\nthose students are received as members who<br />\nare approved or elected. Any obnoxious member may be disciplined or expelled.<br />\nThe<br />\nCharges made for rooms, which are furnished<br />\nwith all things needful, are according to location. The cost of board is assessed pro rata<br />\nupon the members of the common mess, exactly as in old-fashioned student commons, or<br />\ndining clubs, at Harvard and Yale.<br />\nIn the Scotch, as well as in the English colleges, a visitor is impressed with the good administration and efficient household service.<br />\nThere is a well-developed spirit of social unity<br />\nand good fellowship. In these points our<br />\nAmerican dormitory system at boys' schools<br />\nand men's colleges is, in most cases, weak. The<br />\nservice and management are usually bad. Our<br />\nAmerican colleges for women are far superior<br />\nto the old-fashioned dormitories for men. At<br />\nSmith and Bryn Mawr, as in English and<br />\nScotch colleges, you will find common diningrooms and common parlors in the buildings<br />\nwhere students lodge. This, of course, promotes sociability, and the common life, which,<br />\nin men's colleges, is too often relegated to the<br /><br />\nNo. 4<br /><br />\nfraternity house, the gymnasium, the \"cage,\"<br />\nor the ball field. To this general rule there are<br />\nwholesome exceptions a t Lawrenceville,<br />\nWorcester Free Academy, Rutger's College,<br />\nTrinity College, N. C., and other places.<br />\n\u2022 The experience of Oxford, Cambridge and<br />\nEdinburgh Universities has shown the possibility of good social organization in dormitories and of a real common life in large academic towns, where the individual, unless living in some college, is in danger of isolation<br />\nand a more or less hermit mode of existence.<br />\nEspecially in Edinburgh has the institution of<br />\nUniversity Halls, on Castle Hill, socialized and<br />\nunified the hitherto separate and scattered elements of the great student body. It is both<br />\nfeasible and desirable in American college<br />\ntowns to bring together, in the form of Students' Unions, little bands of congenial spirits,<br />\nwho can form social clubs, or open fraternities,<br />\nto which desirable members may be gradually<br />\nelected, upon a broad and liberal plan. The<br />\nupper rooms of the club-house, as in our present fraternity houses, should be rented to members. There should be a common room, or<br />\nparlor, and a dining-room on the first floor, a<br />\nclub cuisine in the basement, and bathrooms in<br />\nall the upper stories. A club mess can easily be<br />\nsustained by residents and boarders under the<br />\ndirection of a student manager or steward,<br />\nwho should cater for the club mess and regulate expenses according to the wishes of its patrons. The business affairs of the club, the<br />\nelection of new members, the collection of<br />\nrents, dues, etc., should be in charge of a house<br />\ncommittee. This kind of administration is well<br />\nunderstood in some of our American College<br />\nFraternities, but it needs social extension and<br />\nacademic popularization.<br />\nIn the Scotch College Hall at Ramsay Garden I was greatly impressed with the interior<br />\nart decorations. As you ascend the winding<br />\nstairways, you find the walls beautifully<br /><br />\n2<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br /><br />\nadorned with hundreds of photographs of Old<br />\nEdinburgh buildings. Modern improvements<br />\nin the \"Old Town\" on the hill have caused<br />\nthe removal of many ancient landmarks and<br />\nhistoric monuments, architectural facades and<br />\npicturesque courts, or ancient \"wyndes,\"<br />\nwhich were once the artist's and tourist's delight. You will now find them all preserved in<br />\nartistic ways, by drawings and photographs on<br />\nthe staircases of the College Hall at Ramsay<br />\nGarden. In the common room of this hall the<br />\nwalls are artistically frescoed to represent certain scenes in Celtic mythology. There is an<br />\nearnest attempt every year at the Edinburgh<br />\nSummer School to revive old Celtic decorative<br />\nart, of which a pleasing exhibition is made on<br />\nacademic premises and in prints and publications.<br />\nEdinburgh is a wonderfully beautiful town,<br />\na queenly city, a modern Athens, set upon hills,<br />\nwith broad thoroughfares, noble monuments<br />\nand public buildings, lovely gardens, extensive<br />\nparks and drives, magnificent outlooks towards<br />\nthe mountains and across the Firth of Forth.<br />\nBut some idea of what the condition of the<br />\ntown once was can be obtained by glancing at<br />\nthe squalid \"survivals\" of filth and misery<br />\nin \"Cowgate\" and other old-time streets and<br />\nalleys in which now dwell \"the submerged<br />\ntenth,\" apparently sunken below the present<br />\nlevel of the city, whose traffic and modern<br />\npromenades are more conspicuously seen<br />\nalong those gigantic causeways which cross the<br />\nold historic ravines or gullies of Edinburgh.<br />\nIn the newest art gallery of the city you will<br />\nfind in an upper room a large collection of<br />\nsketches and water colors, showing Old Edinburgh in all its picturesque squalor. Almost<br />\nevery bit of quaint architecture, every nook and<br />\ncorner of the ancient town, is thus immortalized by the faithful hand of art ; but we must<br />\nremember that those old rookeries on High<br />\nstreet and Canongate, while interesting to look<br />\nat, were not sanitary places of abode. As Robert Louis Stevenson says : \"It is easy to be a<br />\nconservator of the discomforts of others. . . .<br />\nAssuredly, in driving streets through the black<br />\nlabyrinth, a few curious old corners have been<br />\nswept away, and some associations turned out<br /><br />\nof house and home. But what slices of sunlight, what breaths of clean of air, have been<br />\nlet in I And what a picturesque world remains<br />\nuntouched I\"<br />\nWhoever visits Edinburgh will be grateful<br />\nto the memory of Robert Louis Stevenson, and<br />\nwill read and re-read his \"Picturesque Notes\"<br />\non this fascinating old city. No writer has better caught the spirit of the place or sketched its<br />\nsalient features with a truer hand. The visitor<br />\nwill surely encounter this genius loci, Robert<br />\nLouis Stevenson, in the National Portrait Gallery of Edinburgh, where a marble bust of the<br />\ncharming author of \"St. Ives\" greets you<br />\nwith an almost life-like welcome. The man<br />\ntruly lives in literature and in art. The following brief extracts from his \"Picturesque Notes\"<br />\ndescribe Edinburgh :<br />\n\"Few places, if any,\" he says, \"offer a more<br />\nbarbaric display of contrasts to the eye. In the<br />\nvery midst stands one of the most satisfactory<br />\ncrags in nature\u2014a bass rock upon dry land,<br />\nrooted in a garden, shaken by passing trains,<br />\ncarrying a crown of battlements and turrets,<br />\nand describing its warlike shadow over the<br />\nliveliest and brightest thoroughfare of the New<br />\nTown. From their smoky beehives, ten stories<br />\nhigh, the unwashed look down upon the open<br />\nsquares and gardens of the wealthy ; and gay<br />\npeople sunning themselves along Princes<br />\nstreet, with its mile of commercial palaces beflagged upon some great occasion, see, across a<br />\ngardened valley set with statues, where the<br />\nwashings of the old town flutter in the breeze<br />\nat its high windows. And then, upon all sides,<br />\nwhat a clashing of architecture I In this one<br />\nvalley, where the life of the town goes most<br />\nbusily forward, there may be seen, shown one<br />\nabove and behind another by the accidents of<br />\nthe ground, buildings in almost every style<br />\nupon the globe. Egyptian and Greek temples,<br />\nVenetian palaces and Gothic spires, are huddled one over another in a most admired disorder; while, above all, the brute mass of the<br />\nCastle and the summit of Arthur's Seat look<br />\ndown upon these imitations with a becoming<br />\ndignity, as the works of Nature may look down<br />\nupon the monuments of Art.\"<br />\nHERBERT B. ADAMS.<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\nDR. T11-1011AS.<br /><br />\nDr. James Carey Thomas was born in Baltimore on July II, 1833, and died on November<br />\n9, 1897. He graduated from Haverford College in 1852, and from the Medical School of<br />\nthe University of Maryland in 1854. He was<br />\na trustee of the Johns Hopkins University from<br />\nits opening until his death.<br />\nHis efficient, faithful and devoted work in<br />\nmany lines is known to all men. He was a<br />\nphysician in the active practice of that arduous<br />\nprofession, a minister of the 'Gospel in the Society of Friends, a public-spirited philanthropist, keenly interested in every plan for the improvement of his fellowman ; an officer and a<br />\nzealous supporter of the Young Men's Christian Association in this city, and a trustee of<br />\nseveral important educational institutions.<br />\nThis is not the place to write of these manifold<br />\nfields of activity. But it is eminently fitting that<br />\nreference should be made in THE NEWS-LETTER to another side of Dr. Thomas' activity to<br />\nwhich he gave much time, thought and love\u2014<br />\nhis relations to the Johns Hopkins University.<br />\nOnly the trustees can tell how valuable his<br />\nservices were in the organization and development of the University in general, and of the<br />\nMedical School in particular; but certain of<br />\nDr. Thomas' services were such as could be<br />\nseen even by those who came here as students,<br />\nand still more clearly by those who remained<br />\nas instructors, after the conclusion of their<br />\ncourse of studies for a degree.<br />\nFirst of all, he stood for a broad and courageous Christianity in the University. Other<br />\nmen might doubt as to the position of Christianity in the mind of an educated man or in the<br />\nlife of an educational institution ; but we felt<br />\nthat in him we knew one who never hesitated<br />\nin his firm insistence on the greatest freedom<br />\nof scientific research and on the certainty and<br />\nimportance of the Christian religion. None<br />\nShould be ignorantly religious; none should<br />\nbe learned infidels \u2014all should be educated<br />\nChristians. With such convictions, he was a<br />\nmost eager and consistent supporter of everything which tended to make the religious life<br />\nmore vital to the students.<br /><br />\n3<br /><br />\nAnother service, rendered by Dr. Thomas to<br />\nthe University, came from his broad culture.<br />\nHe was the member of the Board of Trustees<br />\nwith whom (next to President Gilman) the students most frequently came in contact, and in<br />\nhim we found the true University spirit. He<br />\nhad none of that narrow specialization into<br />\nwhich professional men are so liable to fall ;<br />\nnone of that distortion of perspective which<br />\nmakes the science studied by you so important<br />\nand those studied by others so insignificant. In<br />\nhim we knew a man whose outlook was over a<br />\nwide field. He was a truly liberal man. Liberality has been defined as \"breadth on high levels,\" and it seems to me that Dr. Thomas' life<br />\nfulfilled that definition. Shallowness was as<br />\nforeign to him as narrowness. His breadth<br />\nwas that of the deep and mighty ocean.<br />\nFinally, his life was one of great influence on<br />\nHopkins men because of its kindliness, purity<br />\nand lovableness. One could not meet him without a friendly word. To chat with him was to<br />\ncatch an inspiration to effort, which lingered<br />\nlong after the conversation was finished. He<br />\nwas so cheerful, so buoyant and hopeful in his<br />\nview of life, so filled with brotherly kindness,<br />\nand his face was so turned towards those things<br />\nthat are pure and lovely, that his presence was<br />\na benediction. Good was it for so many of us<br />\nthat we knew him,and good was it for the University that his influence was so long manifested and so potent here.<br />\nBERNARD C.

The debaters displayed<br />\ngreater self-possession, and were, therefore,<br />\nmore effective. The side which affirmed that<br />\nthe \"silver question\" was now a dead issue, represented by Senators Fisher, R. D.

The<br />\nquestion was very ably debated, and the arguments were effective, especially those of Fosnocht, Levering and Frank. The House took<br />\na very active part in the open discussion. Dr.<br />\nAdams, at the request of the House, spoke a<br />\nfew words. He complimented both the debaters and the House on their able discussion of<br />\nthe question. The subject for debate at the next<br /><br />\nmeeting of the House will be : \"Resolved, That<br />\nthe United States should intervene in behalf of<br />\nCuba.\" The affirmative side will be taken by<br />\nCongressmen Chambers, Bruce and Ramsay;<br />\nthe negative side by Congressmen Fisher, Ross<br />\nand Guggenheimer.

Stoeber, who ascended the greater Ararat, together with Dr.<br />\nEbeling, of Berlin, and Dr. Oswald, of Bale,<br />\nseparated from his companions. They gained<br />\nthe summit, were forced to spend the night at<br />\nan altitude of 16,000 feet, suffering much from<br />\ncold, and returned to the Cossack camp next<br />\nday. There they learned that Stoeber had not<br />\nreturned. An instant search after the lost man<br />\nwas rendered fruitless through a violent snowstorm and through the men's inability to speak<br />\nRussian with the Cossacks. After many difficulties and unavoidable delays, a party composed of Dr. Ebeling, Dr. Oswald and Dr.<br />\nReid continued the search until October 4,<br />\nwhen some Cossacks found Stoeber's body. He<br />\nhad evidently slipped on a ledge of rocks and<br />\nbroken his leg. The cold had killed him before<br />\nhe recovered consciousness.

His interesting<br />\nreminiscences and amusing anecdotes of his<br />\nstudent days at the Johns Hopkins afforded a<br />\nstriking illustration for President Gilman's definition of an university as a\"societas magistrorum ct discipulorum.\" Dr. Sedgwick and Dr.<br />\nWilson were fellow students with Dr. Mitsukuri.

Adams,on \"Student Life<br />\nin Edinburgh.\" In this description of customs<br />\nat the University of Edinburgh, Dr. Adams has<br />\nbrought up a point which merits the thoughtful attention of every member of our University\u2014the existence, namely, of co-operative<br />\ncollege halls.<br />\nA distinguished guest of the University\u2014Sir<br />\nMichael Foster\u2014has recently said that one<br />\nchief source of strength with us lies in the fact<br />\nthat our University is still young enough to be<br />\nmoulded\u2014that there are no iron-bound \"precedents\" to hinder us from developing along<br />\nthe lines of latest improvement, or from adopting unto ourselves the best features of all other<br />\neducational systems.<br />\nIf we accept this theory of constant improvement by selection as our creed\u2014and we could<br />\nnot wish for a better one\u2014then it behooves us<br />\nto consider carefully this system, only recently<br />\ninaugurated at a great sister university, yet already markedly successful there. Until a few<br />\nyears since, Edinburgh had been, like our-<br /><br />\nselves, destitute of any real student life; she<br />\nlacked that side of education which does not<br />\ncome to us from books or lectures, but rather<br />\nis absorbed by living in an atmosphere created<br />\nby a number of cultivated men and earnest<br />\nworkers. Now this void has been filled by the<br />\nmembers of the University themselves, and college halls have sprung up and are flourishing<br />\non the co-operative plan, and without any outside backing.<br />\nThat such a system, if adopted here, would<br />\nprove successful, is likely. That it is needed is<br />\nunquestionable. Students\u2014especially those<br />\nseeking a doctor's degree\u2014are all too prone,<br />\nabsorbed in their own special line of work, to<br />\nforget that duty toward self as an individual, as<br />\nwell as a unit of social humanity, demands of<br />\nthem a general and broadening cultivation as<br />\nan antidote to the narrowing effect of specializing. Again, who,of all these workers scattered<br />\nthroughout the city in boarding houses, has not<br />\nfelt that strain upon the will, greater than any<br />\nstrain of study, which results from sticking to<br />\nwork, day by day, monotonously, with hardly<br />\na taste of outside life to relieve the tension?<br />\nAnd,suffering this strain of lonely self-dependence, would he not draw fresh vigor and enthusiasm from an atmosphere of work and<br />\nearnest purpose, and from the society of cultivated men, come together in the common<br />\nroom of the hall for a little rest and chatting<br />\nafter breakfast or at the end of the day's work?<br />\nSuch a stimulus is dwelt upon in all stories<br />\nand descriptions of English university life,<br />\nwhere this system of halls is in use ; and<br />\nit is of only less value than that broadening of character and rubbing away of<br />\nangles which results from the contact of<br />\nman with his fellow-men. And then there<br />\nis the other side, more interesting to undergraduates, perhaps, than to graduates, yet of<br />\nimportance to both \u2014 the fellowship among<br />\nstudents which this system would foster and<br />\nthe friendships, to whose formation it would<br />\nstand sponsor. All these features\u2014quite as<br />\nimportant in their results as the college work\u2014<br />\nbelong to some extent to the fraternities. But<br />\ntheir scope is limited. The four hundred and<br /><br />\n0E44<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br /><br />\nI<br /><br />\n1<br /><br />\nodd members of the University whose homes<br />\nare out of the city prove the need, while they<br />\nargue the practicability of such a system.<br />\nLast year, at the outset of its career, the<br />\nNEWS-LETTER outlined two wants as being<br />\nmost pressing at the University, and pledged<br />\nits aid in supplying them. They were, better<br />\nathletic facilities, and more college life. Since<br />\nthen the first of these wants has been filled.<br />\nWith gratification we realize that a new spirit<br />\nhas pervaded the whole University from Dan<br />\nto Beersheba, from students even unto trustees, and that it has shown itself in the erection<br />\nof a cage and the search for a field for our athletes. The second want was for a more mature and definite form of college life. And<br />\nthis, too, bids fair to be realized. It is shown<br />\nin the sentiment against the silly forms of hazing formerly practiced here, as well as in the<br />\nestablishment of a college congress. And<br />\nnow, may we not hope that in some future time,<br />\nwhether near or dim, these halls, which will do<br />\nthe most of all toward furthering true academic<br />\nlife, may be embodied in our University? It<br />\nis, at least, a pleasant dream to construct them<br />\nin fancy. There might be one for medical students, lying conveniently half way between the<br />\nHospital buildings on Broadway, and the Laboratories clustered around McCoy Hall ; another for the graduates and members of the<br />\nfaculty, a third for undergraduates\u2014all threads<br />\nof a web which would bring together the scattered lives of our students--which would bring<br />\nabout what Dr. Adams calls \"the real unity of<br />\nacademic life\u2014a college centre where students<br />\nlive and educate one another in their own society\u2014perhaps the most effective of all academic means of culture.\" Of course, these<br />\nhalls will not spring into existence spontaneously. But it is possible here, as was the<br />\ncase in Edinburgh, for a dozen or so students<br />\nto club together and<br />\nmake a beginning. And<br />\nfrom this beginning the development of the<br />\nsystem should be but a question of time.<br />\nFOOTBALL.<br /><br />\n.t<br />\nd<br /><br />\nWith the St. John's game our football season<br />\nPractically closed, as the game with the Baltimore Medical College was regarded as of little<br /><br />\n9<br /><br />\nimportance by Hopkins men, and was played<br />\nwith enough substitutes to cost us the game.<br />\nThe victory over our old rivals on Thanksgiving, however, left a very sweet taste in our<br />\nmouths, and considerable credit is due the team<br />\nfor the hard practice and plucky playing which<br />\ngave us the victory.<br />\nThere are, however, one or two lessons to be<br />\nlearned from the past season which are worth<br />\npointing out. One is, that it is as impossible<br />\nas it is unfair to expect the athletic reputation<br />\nof a university with nearly six hundred students to be adequately sustained by the almost<br />\nunsupported exertions of an undergraduate<br />\nbody amounting to scarcely one-fourth of the<br />\nwhole. There is enough good material in the<br />\ngraduate and medical departments to furnish<br />\nthe 'Varsity with teams which would place her<br />\non the level where she rightly belongs; but this<br />\nmaterial seems quite impossible to be reached.<br />\nOccasionally a \"grad.\" tries for the team, and<br />\nalmost invariably makes it if he practices. But<br />\neven this is but the exception which proves<br />\nthe rule.<br />\nThe other point is the impossibility of getting the best results out of what material we<br />\nhave, without adequate grounds and regular<br />\ncoaching. This was emphasized by the improvement in the team after Mr. Bond took it<br />\nin hand. On the whole, however, the result<br />\nhas been encouraging, and with a cage and an<br />\nathletic field we may indulge in a good many<br />\n\"hopes\" for better results next year.<br />\nCLIPPINGS.<br /><br />\n\"I wonder,\" said the philosophical student,<br />\n\"why a fight is called a scrap ?\"<br />\n\"Because it is a broken peace,\" replied the<br />\nCheerful Idiot, with his usual promptitude.\u2014<br />\nExchange.<br />\n\"Nothing won\" ('oi), is the remark of the<br />\ncolleges, after admitting the freshman class this<br />\nyear.\u2014Exchange.<br />\nThere was a time when every wheelman you<br />\nmet on the road was a gentleman ; now it is<br />\nhard to tell whether it is a gentleman or a<br />\nlady.\u2014Baltimore Life.<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br /><br />\n10<br /><br />\nATHLETICS.<br />\nFOOTBALL.<br /><br />\n25 yards down the field and across the line.<br />\nHodges kicked goal. This settled the game,<br />\nand the Hopkins rooters went wild. Captain<br />\nRobinson was carried off the field on their<br />\nshoulders, under the waving Hopkins banner.<br />\nCambridge in general shared in Hopkins' rejoicing, and the sixty St. John's rooters present<br />\nwere about the only ones to whom the result<br />\nwas a disappointment.

A brace up<br />\nNOTES.<br />\ntook place in the closing moments of the first<br />\nhalf, when the ball went up toward St. John's<br />\nAfter the touchdown was scored the Hopgoal. Finally, at the three-yard line, on the kins rooters fell upon each other's necks and<br />\nthird down, Mullen passed to Straus. There wept for joy. Then they started out and<br />\nwas a misunderstanding, and the play was not clashed all the way around the field, to give<br />\nexecuted. It was a terrible blow to the rooters vent to their feelings. A countryman who<br />\non the side lines, who nevertheless kept up a came to \"see the game\" was much scandalized<br />\nsteady cheering.

M. C., 4; J. H. U., o.<br />\nHopkins lost its last game of the season on<br />\nSaturday, to Baltimore Medical College. The<br />\nMeds. were much heavier, and Hopkins was<br />\nweakened by the absence of both the regular<br />\ntackles. All the Meds'. gains were made<br />\nthrough the line.<br />\nj. H. U., 4; GALLAUDET,6.<br />\nThe 'Varsity lost to Gallaudet by 6 to 4, on<br />\nSaturday, November 13, in Washington. Gallaudet put up a strong game, and Hopkins<br />\nfought fiercely to score, and deserves much<br />\nPraise for practically tieing the deaf mutes.<br />\nIn the first half the 'Varsity eleven went<br />\nthrough Gallaudet's line almost at will, bu,<br />\nthey were not able to do so in the second. Gallaudet would probably have made ,a better<br />\nshowing had not their ambition led them to<br />\nstart before the baIl was in play. They lost a<br />\nnumber of times on this account. The whole<br />\nHopkins eleven did good work. The regrettable feature was that Armstrong had a stiff<br />\nbreeze in which to try for goal, while the home<br />\nplayers had a perfect calm. Straus scored the<br />\ntouchdown for Hopkins in the first half.<br /><br />\nHOPKINS, 4; B. M. C., 4.<br />\nThis game between Hopkins and the Baltimore Medical College was not of very great<br />\nInterest. The College team outclassed our men<br />\nentirely in weight. The 'Varsity team put up<br />\na good showing in<br />\nthe first half, scoring one<br />\ntouchdown. In the second half the weight of<br />\nthe College told upon<br />\nour men, and a touchdown was made by the College. The game<br />\nended in a dispute. When the kick for goal<br />\nwas being tried, the captain ran up and<br />\nhandled<br /><br />\nthe ball, putting it in play. Our men naturally<br />\ntook advantage of this, and carried the ball to<br />\nthe centre of the field. The College team did<br />\nnot look upon this in the same light as the<br />\n'Varsity did, and refused to play. The referee<br />\ndecided Hopkins' view correct, and Walter<br />\nCamp wrote to Captain Robinson that the decision of the referee is final.<br />\nHOCKEY.<br /><br />\nThe prospects for a good hockey team this<br />\nyear are unusually bright. This is proven not<br />\nonly by the large number of candidates, but<br />\nalso by their enthusiasm and determination.<br />\nThis season will witness a notable change in<br />\nthe choosing of the team, as well as of methods<br />\nand style in play. The chief feature of the new<br />\narrangement will be the presence of two teams,<br />\none following Hopkins' attack method and the<br />\nother the various styles of plays pursued by<br />\nother teams. In this manner weak points can<br />\nbe strengthened and faults remedied.<br />\nNo man on the team can feel secure of his<br />\nplace, for a substitute may at any time replace<br />\na regular if by his playing the \"sub\" proves his<br />\ncapability of strengthening that position. This<br />\nwill do away with the discouragement and loss<br />\nof interest that usually follows when a man fails<br />\nto make a team.
