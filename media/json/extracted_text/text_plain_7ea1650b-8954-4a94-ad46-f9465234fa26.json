A superficial<br />\nsounding of the sentiment of some<br />\nfaculty opinion seems to indicate<br />\nthat the plan will be inaugurated<br />\nnext September, with all men in the<br />\nrespective schools similarly affected.<br />\nThe committee will also have to consider the question of credits toward<br />\ndegrees with the altered criteria set<br />\nup.<br />\nThe Committee on Educational<br />\nmethods and policies, a sub-committee<br />\nof the studies board is composed of<br />\nnine faculty members, including Dr<br />\nGeorge H Evans jr, chairman. In all<br />\nprobability the board will not act on<br />\nthe committee's recommendations for<br />\nsome time when they are forthcoming, matters of finance and curricula<br />\nfor next year occupying its immediate<br />\nattention.<br />\nIt is interesting to note in connection with this action, that the Hopkins Medical school found it necessary to likewise increase the number<br />\nof its grades some time back. Graduating doctors were encountering difficulty in securing internships, due to<br />\nthe difficulty of definition of their<br />\npass or fail grade.<br />\nAccording to comment by members<br />\nof the Collegiate board, the action<br />\nwas taken in view of the difficulty encountered by men attempting to<br />\nmatriculate into graduate schools and<br />\nadvanced positions, arising from the<br />\nflexibility and difficulty in interpreting the S grade. The issue had been<br />\nraised in the past, when students applying to \u2022 medical and graduate<br />\nschools had been told that it was impossible to evaluate their standing on<br />\na satisfactory basis, an S covering too<br />\nbroad a field to be of any value as a<br />\nmark.<br />\nFeeling that while the present system was perfectly satisfactory from a<br />\nHopkins' point of view, perhaps, but<br />\nunfair to those graduates forced to<br />\nturn elsewhere, the committee took<br />\nthis step as a solution to the problem,<br />\nhoping the new plan will provide for<br />\na better qualitative classification.<br />\nThe three mark system was inaugurated by Dean Berry about eight<br />\nyears ago, and has been in operation<br />\never since. It is more or less unique<br />\nwith the Hopkins, most other universities resorting to a five letter, or<br />\nnumerical system. It has been this<br />\nconflict which has lain at the root of<br />\nthe trouble.<br />\nThe matter drew to a head this<br />\nyear when both students and faculty<br />\nmembers had the difficulty called to<br />\ntheir attentions repeatedly. A crying<br />\nneed for immediate action was felt,<br />\nand the action was forthcoming.<br />\nThe Board of Collegiate studies<br />\nconsists of 41 faculty members, presided over by the president of the<br />\nuniversity and with Dean Edward<br />\nBerry as vice-chairman.

But we're not just blowing off steam.<br />\nThere are ways of preserving the present advantageous system and yet coping with- its shortcomings.<br />\nWe have in mind a scheme which would involve<br />\nmuch time and interest on the part of the faculty, but<br />\nwhich we feel would more than pay its dividends in<br />\nraised standards. This plan may be applied to any<br />\nparticular group, and is in most respects in actual<br />\noperation in certain departments.<br />\nConsider, for example's sake, for the pre-medical<br />\ngroup, it might operate somewhat as follows:\u2014<br />\nA committee of about fifteen men, intimately and<br />\ncapably associated with the pre-med curriculum could<br />\nbe set up. Each man aspiring to a pre-medical major<br />\nwould be required to petition this group for admission in the middle of his second year. The committee<br />\nwould then, by interviewing these men, by considering their records to date, and through their personal<br />\nacquaintance with them (inevitable in such a committee), weed out those men who are obviously scheduled<br />\nfor failure as pre-meds. That such men exist in any<br />\ngroup is obvious on the most superficial consideration.<br />\nThese men would not be allowed to become pre-meds,<br />\nbut would be compelled to enter another group.<br />\nSo far this plan contains nothing not already in effect. Theoretically, this elimination occurs under our<br />\npresent system. Thus, we would automatically increase<br />\nthe percentage of medical aspirants who will ultimately<br />\nbe accepted.<br />\nBut the committee's most important task would be<br />\nyet to come. During his last two years, the pre-meds<br />\nwould be carefully observed, so that finally, the committee could draw up a detailed analysis of each man's<br />\ngrades, which would become a part of his transcript.<br />\nThus would the problem of interpretation of marks<br />\nbe met.<br />\nTwo birds are killed with one stone. The bugaboo<br />\nof sharply differentiated marks forcing students into<br />\na hyperconsciousness of grades is avoided, while the<br />\nultimate effect of such marks is achieved.<br />\nThe plan is outlined in the sketchiest possible form,<br />\n.but we believe its structure to be clear. That it would<br />\ninvolve a mass of work is obvious, yet is is not as appalling as might appear.<br />\nUltimately, such a plan should prove most successful. Its general applicability is to its credit, and the<br />\ndifficulties attached to its inauguration not so great as<br />\nto be nearly prohibitive.

The<br />\npassage of the years and the corresponding intensification in competition pointed ever more fatefully to<br />\nchange as a mere question of time. Those men enter,<br />\ning the competitive field\u2014primarily pre-meds\u2014were<br />\nincreasingly handicapped by the lack of definitive<br />\nbasis in the satisfactory grade. Standards for corn-,<br />\nparison were lacking, and oversight or disregard was<br />\nthe consequence.<br />\nBut the advantages of the H S F system were great.<br />\nAt the Hopkins, by virtue of this system, education<br />\nand not marks was the ultimate aim. An H was not<br />\na goal to be striven for, so much as an indication of a<br />\nsuperior scholar. Thus, the bulk of the student body,<br />\ngetting an S regardless of degree, was forced into a<br />\nrecognition of education\u2014the most thrillingly important experience ,of one's life\u2014rather than reward as<br />\nthe important phase of a college career. This was in<br />\nkeeping, and had to be in keeping, with those elementary tenets to which any great educational institution must adhere.<br />\nThat others perhaps did not see eye to eye with us<br />\nis sad. The interpretation of the tenets must lie with<br />\neach institution\u2014that is what imparts to it its individuality and, for better or for worse, makes it what it<br />\nis. Yjet, isolation is impossible. We exist in society, not<br />\nalone, but as a part of it, else we do not exist for long.<br />\nBut if Mohammed must go to the mountain, he need<br />\nnot go afoot when better ways may exist. The changing of the marking system is a footpath, a last resort\u2014<br />\nwe've thrown in the towel. The Hopkins was two decades ahead of American undergraduate educational<br />\nsystems. In the choice of two evils it has chosen the<br />\ngreater. Instead of marking time by some method, and<br />\nwaiting for the rest, it about faced and went to meet<br />\nthem!<br />\nWe are firmly convinced that by adopting a system such as the Board has, the Hopkins is forcing its<br />\nstudents to work and study and cram for marks, allowing them no choice but to finish the required work<br />\nin the best way possible lest the competition down them.<br />\nAny incentive for initiative along cultural or research<br />\nlines is not only hindered but practically killed. This<br />\nis not an education\u2014certainly not a Hopkins education.<br />\nBut we know that the Board realizes this. We know<br />\nthat the abandonment of principle was not effected<br />\nwithout the conviction that it was for the greatest good<br />\nof all concerned. We merely lament the fact that some<br />\nother means for interpreting marks could have been<br />\nfound that would not necessitate scrapping a plan that<br />\nwas good in theory and working here in practice.<br />\nThe Hopkins is a truly great center of learning.<br />\nIt must remain one.

They all hung their heads<br />\nand observed a minute's silence in<br />\nhis memory.<br />\nJust then heels tapped on the pavement. The group scurried for cover,<br />\nfrantically diving for the shrubbery.<br />\nThen all was still.<br />\nOne of them parted the bushes<br />\nand peered out.<br />\n\"It's a hooded figure,\" he whispered to the others, \"probably one of<br />\nthe president's spies!\" They gasped,<br />\nand each held his breath.<br />\nThe new-corner walked to the steps<br />\nhurriedly, glancing at his watch.<br />\n\"Wait a minute!\" whispered the<br />\nlookout. \"I thing it's one of us.

The field of music<br />\nhas also been overrun by that individualist, the vocalist, and bands vie<br />\nwith one another in their efforts to<br />\nsecure the best singers. At one time<br />\nwhen Morton Downey and the Boswell Sisters commanded attention,<br />\nthe public was clamoring for singers<br />\nand more singers. Today we've reached that point again; so many talented<br />\n(and some not so talented) singers<br />\nhave made bids for fame, and most<br />\nof them have chosen the victrola record as the medium by which they<br />\nhoped to reach many ears.<br />\nPerhaps the best trio of them all<br />\nis that group of Southern girls, the<br />\nAndrews Sisters. They happened to<br />\nhave a colorful combination with a<br />\nswell arranger and so they got to<br />\nthe top with one record, \"Bei Mir Bist<br />\nDu Sehon\". But they were lucky<br />\nenough-and good enough-to be able to<br />\nstay at the top, and by now they have<br />\n<br />\na large group of fans waiting for<br />\ntheir every new release. Their latest<br />\nkiller \"Hold Tight\" can tell its own<br />\nstory as to whether or not the Andrews 'Sisters are fading. The next<br />\nsensation was Maxine Sullivan whose<br />\nplaintive warblings tore many a<br />\nheart. Although she started off as a<br />\nswing singer and although she still<br />\ndoes rip into a fast number every<br />\nnow and then, still her field is blues<br />\nand she seems to have her own recipe<br />\nor handling torch ballads.

(Oh yes, I do<br />\nlike Maxine Sullivan!).<br />\nWhile the Andrews Sisters became<br />\nfamous by chance, Mary Martin, currently of \"Leave it to Me,\" had a<br />\ncrew of publicity men and Broadway<br />\ncritics behind her.

We have come<br />\nto realize that it is only in the eternal search for knowledge that the<br />\nfull dignity of human life is achieved.<br />\nThe second aberration which he<br />\ndescribed was \"the submergence of<br />\ntile individual.\" The liberties which<br />\nman enjoys are the rights which have<br />\nbeen wrested from government, he<br />\ndeclared. He 'admitted however, that<br />\nregulation by government for the<br />\npublic good may often be necessary.<br />\nHe also was careful to note that<br />\nwhereas government attempts to<br />\ncoerce the individual, religion seeks<br />\nto emancipate him.<br />\n\"The third aberration is the pathologic distortion of nationalism. True,<br />\nnationalism can be a sound thing, as<br />\nis patriotism and self-determination;<br />\nbut nationalism today is diseased and<br />\ncovers much charlatanism and economic piracy.\"<br />\nDr Silver pointed out that it is<br />\nthis nationalism that makes Italy<br />\nwant to civilize Ethiopia, and Japan<br />\nChina; while in Germany it has been<br />\ndistorted into an ardent racialism.<br />\n\"The fourth aberration is militarism, the physical intellectual and psychic coordination of the masses in<br />\npreparation for war. The war motif<br />\nis becoming the play motif of modern<br />\nEurope.<br />\n\"Some are persuaded that the world<br />\nwill ultimately be restored to balance<br />\nand sanity by evolution; yet there<br />\nis nothing in the doctrine of evolution<br />\nwhich guarantees man's continuous<br />\nupward ascent. This return must be<br />\nachieved by men who can think with<br />\na minimum of intolerance and a maximum of restraint.\"<br />\nDr Silver advocated the defense of<br />\nthe freedom of the human mind, the<br />\npreservation of the remaining rights<br />\nof the individual, and the participation of the United States in another<br />\nLeague of Nations to insure peace.<br />\n<br />\nTable, please!<br />\nThe B S A issued yesterday<br />\ninstructions for the reservation<br />\n<br />\nDiscussion group<br />\nrepeats panel<br />\n<br />\nTable reservations will be<br />\ndivided into two classes, fraternity and non-fraternity.

A superficial<br />\nsounding of the sentiment of some<br />\nfaculty opinion seems to indicate<br />\nthat the plan will be inaugurated<br />\nnext September, with all men in the<br />\nrespective schools similarly affected.<br />\nThe committee will also have to consider the question of credits toward<br />\ndegrees with the altered criteria set<br />\nup.<br />\nThe Committee on Educational<br />\nmethods and policies, a sub-committee<br />\nof the studies board is composed of<br />\nnine faculty members, including Dr<br />\nGeorge H Evans jr, chairman. In all<br />\nprobability the board will not act on<br />\nthe committee's recommendations for<br />\nsome time when they are forthcoming, matters of finance and curricula<br />\nfor next year occupying its immediate<br />\nattention.<br />\nIt is interesting to note in connection with this action, that the Hopkins Medical school found it necessary to likewise increase the number<br />\nof its grades some time back. Graduating doctors were encountering difficulty in securing internships, due to<br />\nthe difficulty of definition of their<br />\npass or fail grade.<br />\nAccording to comment by members<br />\nof the Collegiate board, the action<br />\nwas taken in view of the difficulty encountered by men attempting to<br />\nmatriculate into graduate schools and<br />\nadvanced positions, arising from the<br />\nflexibility and difficulty in interpreting the S grade. The issue had been<br />\nraised in the past, when students applying to \u2022 medical and graduate<br />\nschools had been told that it was impossible to evaluate their standing on<br />\na satisfactory basis, an S covering too<br />\nbroad a field to be of any value as a<br />\nmark.<br />\nFeeling that while the present system was perfectly satisfactory from a<br />\nHopkins' point of view, perhaps, but<br />\nunfair to those graduates forced to<br />\nturn elsewhere, the committee took<br />\nthis step as a solution to the problem,<br />\nhoping the new plan will provide for<br />\na better qualitative classification.<br />\nThe three mark system was inaugurated by Dean Berry about eight<br />\nyears ago, and has been in operation<br />\never since. It is more or less unique<br />\nwith the Hopkins, most other universities resorting to a five letter, or<br />\nnumerical system. It has been this<br />\nconflict which has lain at the root of<br />\nthe trouble.<br />\nThe matter drew to a head this<br />\nyear when both students and faculty<br />\nmembers had the difficulty called to<br />\ntheir attentions repeatedly. A crying<br />\nneed for immediate action was felt,<br />\nand the action was forthcoming.<br />\nThe Board of Collegiate studies<br />\nconsists of 41 faculty members, presided over by the president of the<br />\nuniversity and with Dean Edward<br />\nBerry as vice-chairman. Dr R B<br />\nRoulston is secretary.

But we're not just blowing off steam.<br />\nThere are ways of preserving the present advantageous system and yet coping with- its shortcomings.<br />\nWe have in mind a scheme which would involve<br />\nmuch time and interest on the part of the faculty, but<br />\nwhich we feel would more than pay its dividends in<br />\nraised standards. This plan may be applied to any<br />\nparticular group, and is in most respects in actual<br />\noperation in certain departments.<br />\nConsider, for example's sake, for the pre-medical<br />\ngroup, it might operate somewhat as follows:\u2014<br />\nA committee of about fifteen men, intimately and<br />\ncapably associated with the pre-med curriculum could<br />\nbe set up. Each man aspiring to a pre-medical major<br />\nwould be required to petition this group for admission in the middle of his second year. The committee<br />\nwould then, by interviewing these men, by considering their records to date, and through their personal<br />\nacquaintance with them (inevitable in such a committee), weed out those men who are obviously scheduled<br />\nfor failure as pre-meds. That such men exist in any<br />\ngroup is obvious on the most superficial consideration.<br />\nThese men would not be allowed to become pre-meds,<br />\nbut would be compelled to enter another group.<br />\nSo far this plan contains nothing not already in effect. Theoretically, this elimination occurs under our<br />\npresent system. Thus, we would automatically increase<br />\nthe percentage of medical aspirants who will ultimately<br />\nbe accepted.<br />\nBut the committee's most important task would be<br />\nyet to come. During his last two years, the pre-meds<br />\nwould be carefully observed, so that finally, the committee could draw up a detailed analysis of each man's<br />\ngrades, which would become a part of his transcript.<br />\nThus would the problem of interpretation of marks<br />\nbe met.<br />\nTwo birds are killed with one stone. The bugaboo<br />\nof sharply differentiated marks forcing students into<br />\na hyperconsciousness of grades is avoided, while the<br />\nultimate effect of such marks is achieved.<br />\nThe plan is outlined in the sketchiest possible form,<br />\n.but we believe its structure to be clear. That it would<br />\ninvolve a mass of work is obvious, yet is is not as appalling as might appear.<br />\nUltimately, such a plan should prove most successful. Its general applicability is to its credit, and the<br />\ndifficulties attached to its inauguration not so great as<br />\nto be nearly prohibitive.

The<br />\npassage of the years and the corresponding intensification in competition pointed ever more fatefully to<br />\nchange as a mere question of time. Those men enter,<br />\ning the competitive field\u2014primarily pre-meds\u2014were<br />\nincreasingly handicapped by the lack of definitive<br />\nbasis in the satisfactory grade. Standards for corn-,<br />\nparison were lacking, and oversight or disregard was<br />\nthe consequence.<br />\nBut the advantages of the H S F system were great.<br />\nAt the Hopkins, by virtue of this system, education<br />\nand not marks was the ultimate aim. An H was not<br />\na goal to be striven for, so much as an indication of a<br />\nsuperior scholar. Thus, the bulk of the student body,<br />\ngetting an S regardless of degree, was forced into a<br />\nrecognition of education\u2014the most thrillingly important experience ,of one's life\u2014rather than reward as<br />\nthe important phase of a college career. This was in<br />\nkeeping, and had to be in keeping, with those elementary tenets to which any great educational institution must adhere.<br />\nThat others perhaps did not see eye to eye with us<br />\nis sad. The interpretation of the tenets must lie with<br />\neach institution\u2014that is what imparts to it its individuality and, for better or for worse, makes it what it<br />\nis. Yjet, isolation is impossible. We exist in society, not<br />\nalone, but as a part of it, else we do not exist for long.<br />\nBut if Mohammed must go to the mountain, he need<br />\nnot go afoot when better ways may exist. The changing of the marking system is a footpath, a last resort\u2014<br />\nwe've thrown in the towel. The Hopkins was two decades ahead of American undergraduate educational<br />\nsystems. In the choice of two evils it has chosen the<br />\ngreater. Instead of marking time by some method, and<br />\nwaiting for the rest, it about faced and went to meet<br />\nthem!<br />\nWe are firmly convinced that by adopting a system such as the Board has, the Hopkins is forcing its<br />\nstudents to work and study and cram for marks, allowing them no choice but to finish the required work<br />\nin the best way possible lest the competition down them.<br />\nAny incentive for initiative along cultural or research<br />\nlines is not only hindered but practically killed. This<br />\nis not an education\u2014certainly not a Hopkins education.<br />\nBut we know that the Board realizes this. We know<br />\nthat the abandonment of principle was not effected<br />\nwithout the conviction that it was for the greatest good<br />\nof all concerned. We merely lament the fact that some<br />\nother means for interpreting marks could have been<br />\nfound that would not necessitate scrapping a plan that<br />\nwas good in theory and working here in practice.<br />\nThe Hopkins is a truly great center of learning.<br />\nIt must remain one. Because the whole world was out<br />\nof step with us, we have yielded. Many are to benefit<br />\nfrom our step back. The number must justify the action\u2014must represent a step forward. The Hopkins,<br />\nhowever, must never become a mere school. It must<br />\nalways be a University, with all therein implied.<br /><br />\ntem.<br /><br />\nWell, it's one way, at least, of marking time while<br />\nblazing the trail.<br />\nA journalistic masterpiece<br />\nlast Monday announced the<br />\nemerging of the now-legendary Y C L from a year's<br />\nhibernation.

Both men have<br />\nworked long and hard, and are deserving, willing and<br />\nable to face the demands of their new jobs.<br />\nA question, however, presents itself. What sort of<br />\nan election system do the Stormers have, wherein an<br />\nactor, not Al Agrin in particular, but any actor, becomes business manager? We have no qualms concerning Mr Agrin's ability to handle the job.

From the shadows four<br />\nhooded figures emerged and slunk<br />\ntoward the steps of Levering hall,<br />\ncasting furtive glances behind them.<br />\nThey met and gave a sign and<br />\ncountersign. \"This life is hell,\" one<br />\nof them said in low earnest tones.<br />\n\"I don't know when I'm going to be<br />\ncaught and beaten.\"<br />\n\"Have courage, Comrade,\" another<br />\nsaid. \"The life of a Young Communist Leaguer at Hopkins is a life<br />\nof persecution, but we must move<br />\namong the threats with courage.\"<br />\n\"I heard it was three of us,\"<br />\nready flogged two of us with a rubber hose and hid the bodies!\" the<br />\nshort one said.<br />\n\"I heard it was three of us,\"<br />\nanswered the tall one. \"Let's take<br />\nthe roll.\"<br />\nOne of them stood before each of<br />\nthe others in turn, repeated a phrase<br />\nand received one in reply.

They all hung their heads<br />\nand observed a minute's silence in<br />\nhis memory.<br />\nJust then heels tapped on the pavement. The group scurried for cover,<br />\nfrantically diving for the shrubbery.<br />\nThen all was still.<br />\nOne of them parted the bushes<br />\nand peered out.<br />\n\"It's a hooded figure,\" he whispered to the others, \"probably one of<br />\nthe president's spies!\" They gasped,<br />\nand each held his breath.<br />\nThe new-corner walked to the steps<br />\nhurriedly, glancing at his watch.<br />\n\"Wait a minute!\" whispered the<br />\nlookout. \"I thing it's one of us. I'll<br />\ngo closer and see.\"<br />\nHe snesked from one shrub to the<br />\nnext on his hands and knees, always<br />\nkeeping in the shadows. When he<br />\ndrew very near the steps, he saw the<br />\nred letters on the newcomer's hood.<br />\nThis reassured him.<br />\nHe stood up by the steps and said,<br />\n\"It's all right fellows.\"<br />\nThe hooded figure on the steps<br />\nleaped to his feet, screamed and tore<br />\noff into the night.

The field of music<br />\nhas also been overrun by that individualist, the vocalist, and bands vie<br />\nwith one another in their efforts to<br />\nsecure the best singers. At one time<br />\nwhen Morton Downey and the Boswell Sisters commanded attention,<br />\nthe public was clamoring for singers<br />\nand more singers. Today we've reached that point again; so many talented<br />\n(and some not so talented) singers<br />\nhave made bids for fame, and most<br />\nof them have chosen the victrola record as the medium by which they<br />\nhoped to reach many ears.<br />\nPerhaps the best trio of them all<br />\nis that group of Southern girls, the<br />\nAndrews Sisters. They happened to<br />\nhave a colorful combination with a<br />\nswell arranger and so they got to<br />\nthe top with one record, \"Bei Mir Bist<br />\nDu Sehon\". But they were lucky<br />\nenough-and good enough-to be able to<br />\nstay at the top, and by now they have<br /><br />\na large group of fans waiting for<br />\ntheir every new release. Their latest<br />\nkiller \"Hold Tight\" can tell its own<br />\nstory as to whether or not the Andrews 'Sisters are fading. The next<br />\nsensation was Maxine Sullivan whose<br />\nplaintive warblings tore many a<br />\nheart. Although she started off as a<br />\nswing singer and although she still<br />\ndoes rip into a fast number every<br />\nnow and then, still her field is blues<br />\nand she seems to have her own recipe<br />\nor handling torch ballads.

We have come<br />\nto realize that it is only in the eternal search for knowledge that the<br />\nfull dignity of human life is achieved.<br />\nThe second aberration which he<br />\ndescribed was \"the submergence of<br />\ntile individual.\" The liberties which<br />\nman enjoys are the rights which have<br />\nbeen wrested from government, he<br />\ndeclared. He 'admitted however, that<br />\nregulation by government for the<br />\npublic good may often be necessary.<br />\nHe also was careful to note that<br />\nwhereas government attempts to<br />\ncoerce the individual, religion seeks<br />\nto emancipate him.<br />\n\"The third aberration is the pathologic distortion of nationalism. True,<br />\nnationalism can be a sound thing, as<br />\nis patriotism and self-determination;<br />\nbut nationalism today is diseased and<br />\ncovers much charlatanism and economic piracy.\"<br />\nDr Silver pointed out that it is<br />\nthis nationalism that makes Italy<br />\nwant to civilize Ethiopia, and Japan<br />\nChina; while in Germany it has been<br />\ndistorted into an ardent racialism.<br />\n\"The fourth aberration is militarism, the physical intellectual and psychic coordination of the masses in<br />\npreparation for war. The war motif<br />\nis becoming the play motif of modern<br />\nEurope.<br />\n\"Some are persuaded that the world<br />\nwill ultimately be restored to balance<br />\nand sanity by evolution; yet there<br />\nis nothing in the doctrine of evolution<br />\nwhich guarantees man's continuous<br />\nupward ascent. This return must be<br />\nachieved by men who can think with<br />\na minimum of intolerance and a maximum of restraint.\"<br />\nDr Silver advocated the defense of<br />\nthe freedom of the human mind, the<br />\npreservation of the remaining rights<br />\nof the individual, and the participation of the United States in another<br />\nLeague of Nations to insure peace.<br /><br />\nTable, please!<br />\nThe B S A issued yesterday<br />\ninstructions for the reservation<br /><br />\nDiscussion group<br />\nrepeats panel<br /><br />\nTable reservations will be<br />\ndivided into two classes, fraternity and non-fraternity.
