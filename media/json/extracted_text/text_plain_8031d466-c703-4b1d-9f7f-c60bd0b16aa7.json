According to a statement to the News-Letter by Burt Sharp, executive<br />\ndirector of PCA, a group of Hopkins students representing the<br />\nStudent Assembly Committee asked whether Henry Wallace might<br />\nbe brought to the campus to address the student body. Sharp assured them that Wallace would consent to speak at the Hopkins.<br />\nSeveral days later, Sharp was notified that the assembly was<br />\noff unless a Republican of equal stature would also accept an invitation to speak.

Yeats felt that rhyme verse<br />\nwas good for a short play, in keeping with the theory that the blank<br />\nverse form of Shakespeare was not<br />\nrapid enough for the tempo of life<br />\ntoday.<br />\nAmple use of alliteration is<br />\nfound in Eliot's work, and his timing is excellent.
