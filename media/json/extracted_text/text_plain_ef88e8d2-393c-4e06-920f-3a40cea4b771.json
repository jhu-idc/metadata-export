He<br />\nsaid that he hopes it could be started by the fall<br />\nof 1969, but that the school will proceed only<br />\n\"as fast as is consistent with good academics\",<br />\nand that there will probably be a delay of at<br />\nleast a year before it goes into use.<br />\nAccording to Dean Swanson there are two<br />\nmajor roadblocks to the early implementation of<br />\nthe plan. The first is that a number of details<br />\nwill have to be ironed out before the plan's<br />\nmajor purpose, that of simplifying<br />\nintradivisional registration, can be achieved. This<br />\nDEAN SWANSON, who hopes to institute calendar<br />\npart of the plan will involve the co-ordination<br />\nand co-operation of the Hopkins Medical for next fall.<br />\nSchool, SAIS, and the School of Hygiene and<br />\nPublic Health, as well as Homewood. of the mini-semester. Course offerings for the<br />\nUndoubtedly the process of choosing one month period are to be handled by the<br />\ncommittees from each division .to handle these individual departments. The class proposals will<br />\nhave to be academically sound before they can<br />\ndetails will take some time.<br />\nbe accepted, and the job of designing such<br />\nThe other problem arises from the nature courses is sure to be long and difficult.<br />\nDean Swanson said that the starting date<br />\nof the plan was largely dependent on these two<br />\npoints. He felt that they would yield solutions,<br />\nbut that some delay is almost inevitable. At<br />\npresent, the final draft of the Committee's<br />\nproposals is being rewritten by Dean Swanson,<br />\nand Dr. Bevan (the Committee chairman) before<br />\nHowever, faculty members raised several<br />\nits submission to President Gordon for his<br />\nobjections to these ideas. About five professors objected<br />\napproval.<br />\nbecause they had never heard of the plan before, and<br />\nA survey of other administrative officials<br />\nthey said they would need more time to decide on its<br />\nmerits. Dr. Gordon said that the plan was not intended<br />\nbrought out a-number of opinions and views on<br />\nto be a secret and that some professors did know about<br />\nhow the new plan should work and why it will<br />\nit already. Moreover, he said that the committee had not<br />\nprobably be delayed. Another barrier to early<br />\nyet submitted the plan in a final form.<br />\nimplementation concerns next year's freshman<br />\nOne professor claimed that such a program would<br />\nclass.

Although some professors<br />\nfavored using students from Goucher while another<br />\nproposed that the University simply open admissions to<br />\nall qualified students, most were clearly bored by the<br />\nissue. There was also a question as to how many female<br />\nstudents should be admitted on the undergraduate level<br />\nregardless of how they were recruited.<br />\nHealth Sciences<br />\nDirectly related to the co-education question was<br />\nDr. Gordon's proposal that a School of Allied Health<br />\nSciences be established at the University. A committee<br />\nhas been studying this idea since 1967 and has<br />\nrecommended several alternative programs in this area.<br />\nOne /plan calls for Hopkins to train 125 nurses and<br />\nmedical tetqhnicians a year at a special school that would<br />\nbe built in East Baltimore. Hopkins professors would<br />\ntravel from Homewood to teach at the new school.<br />\nA second plan would require the University to<br />\naccept 125 nurses and technicians a year who would<br />\nspend their first two years studying at Homewood and<br />\ntheir last two years working at the medical center. They<br />\nwould follow a special program which would include<br />\nboth liberal arts and sciences. In either case, the program<br />\nwould begin in the Fall of 1970.<br />\n<br />\n(Continued to Page 4)<br />\n<br />\n(Continued to Page 5)<br />\n<br />\nResearch \"Strike\" Seeks Support<br />\nBy RICHARD CRAMER<br />\nNews Director<br />\n<br />\nPlans to effect a one day \"research<br />\nstoppage\" at Hopkins on March 4 are proceeding<br />\nas faculty members respond to a letter soliciting<br />\ntheir support of the \"strike\".<br />\n<br />\nOne week ago, a letter was sent to all of Hopkins'<br />\n293 faculty members explaining the goals of the effort<br />\nand asking teachers to demonstrate their support.<br />\nAccording to the letter, the signatures which the<br />\nprofessors were to send were secondary to their<br />\nagreement to use class time on March 4 discussing the<br />\ninfluence of the military in America.<br />\nThe AHCCSSF?<br />\n\"Our primary goal is not to get a massive list of<br />\nfaculty signatures,\" said Michael Ornstein, one of the<br />\norganizers of \"The Ad Hoc Committee of Concerned<br />\n<br />\nScholars, Scientists and Faculty.\" Rather, Ornstein and<br />\nhis fellow committee members (there are seven in all)<br />\nbelieve that the importance of the \"strike\" lies in its<br />\nfunction of focusing the attention of the campus on the<br />\nproblem of the military's massive influence in American<br />\npolicy and society.<br />\nActually, this \"research stoppage\" will not really<br />\ntake the form of a strike.

They must be more flexible for the disadvantaged<br />\nstudent and must take his background into account.\"<br />\nBesides this recognition, HECUA is also instructing the<br />\nguidance counselors of the Inner City of college<br />\nrequirements.

This would formalize the BSU as an<br />\nofficial extracurricular activity, and entitle it to<br />\nsome advantages.<br />\nThis constitution was not ratified by the Council,<br />\nas a majority of its members felt that the membership<br />\nclause was discriminatory. The phrase in question read,<br />\n\"the membership of the Black Students Organization<br />\nshall be open to all black members of the Johns Hopkins<br />\nstudent body.\" This was felt necessary by the BSU to<br />\naid in its recruitment of blacks for Hopkins. The Council<br />\nvote was not taken as a setback by the BSU, however, as<br />\nits president, Bruce Baker, declared that they would<br />\n\"completely ignore the Student Council's decision.\"<br />\nDiscrimination Amendment<br />\nIn the wake of the BSU controversy sophomore<br />\nDean Rudoy introduced an amendment to the SC<br />\nconstitution which would prohibit the qpproval of any<br />\ngroup's character which restricted membership on the<br />\nbasis of race, creed, religion, or national origin. This<br />\namendment was passed by a vote of 13-0-0 on November<br />\n11, and was to be submitted within two weeks to the<br />\nstudent body in a referendum for final approval. It has<br />\nnot been.<br />\nReasons for this inaction were advanced by<br />\nCouncil president Russ Passarella, who said that the SC<br />\nwas too busy between Thanksgiving and Christmas with<br />\nthe Eisenhower Symposium, and that from Christmas to<br />\nthe end of the semester \"everyone was throating for<br />\nexams and we didn't think we could get the necessary<br />\nresponse.\" Passarella failed to mention the two-week<br />\nperiod between November 11 and Thanksgiving.<br />\nAt present the status of the discrimination<br />\namendment is pending the recommendations of a<br />\ncommittee, headed by Manuel Rodriguez, which is<br />\nconducting an extensive review of the SC constitution.<br />\nWhens that committee makes its report, then the<br />\nreferendum will be held.<br />\nNew Committees<br />\nDuring the semester the Council has also been<br />\ninvolved in improving relationships between students,<br />\nfaculty, and administration.

Its first engagement will be at the end of this<br />\nmonth, before a businessmen's club.<br />\nPolitics and the presidential election also<br />\ninterested the Student Council during the previous<br />\nsemester. A resolution was adopted on October 28 to<br />\nsupport the SDS teach-in, held on Nov. 4, and the<br />\nWashington demonstrations, held on Nov. 5, election<br />\nday. The activities were \"a legitimate sign of protest in a<br />\ndemocratic society against the present vacuum of<br />\nleadership and the lack of popular democratic control in<br />\nthis society,\" the resolution said.<br />\nWilling to back up the words of the resolution<br />\nwith cash, the Council voted to refund bail money to<br />\nthose Hoppies arrested in the Washington<br />\ndemonstrations. Funds were approved for those charged<br />\nwith \"demonstrating without a permit.\"<br />\nSergio Loses Pesos<br />\nQuestions have been raised about the quality of<br />\nmusical groups brought to Homewood. The Student<br />\nCouncil has sponsored the Serendipity Singers, Charlie<br />\nByrd, Sergio Mendes and Brasil '66, and Tim Hardin.<br />\nCount Basic and the Vanilla Fudge will appear this<br />\nspring. The Sergio Mendes concert was budgeted for a<br />\nloss, and proved to live up to its fiscal expectations.<br />\nEx-council member, Greg Mertz revealed that Big<br />\nBrother and the Holding Company and Traffic could<br />\nhave been obtained for a joint concert in place of Sergio<br />\nMendes, and for a less expensive fee. According to him<br />\nPassarella's inaction was the cause of this opportunity<br />\nbeing missed. He also said that the Jefferson Airplane<br />\nand the Cream could have replaced the Mothers of<br />\nInvention and the Lovin' Spoonful as last year's<br />\nperformers.<br />\nOn many occasions Mertz has suggested to<br />\nPassarella the possibility of establishing groups of<br />\nstudents interested in one particular field of music, who<br />\nwould then concur as to what the best attraction in that<br />\nfield would be. He was always turned down, as Passarella<br />\nclaimed that these committees would become closed<br />\nspecial interest groups.<br />\nEisenhower Symposium<br />\nDuring the first two weeks of December the<br />\nStudent Council presented the Eisenhower Symposium<br />\n<br />\nMR.

The constitution of the new<br />\ncampus newspaper, The Odyssey, was approved at the<br />\nJanuary 13 meeting, after the regular rules had been<br />\nwaived. This was done so that the first issue could<br />\nappear in early February. A new constitution was<br />\nwritten for the Hullabaloo, limiting the amount of<br />\nmoney it can spend.

Thus, the<br />\nconstitution of a new student organization must be<br />\nsubmitted to the Council for approv 1; and, barring<br />\ndiscrimination or the political character of the<br />\norganization, Council approval usually leads to funding.<br />\nIn the late spring, organizational budget requests<br />\nare submitted to the Executive Committee, which,<br />\naccording to Bilgrave, passes on the requests in \"a fair<br />\nand equitable way.\" In defending the composition of the<br />\nCommittee, Bilgrave noted that, \"To my way of<br />\nthinking, the students who would best represent the<br />\nstudent body would be the President of the Student<br />\nCouncil and the President of the SAC.\"(The SAC is a<br />\nself-perpetuating body, and its chairman is selected by<br />\nthe membership.)<br />\nIn allocating funds, the Committee looks for<br />\nseveral indicators, chiefly thes number of students<br />\ninvolved, whether or not the organization operates<br />\nwithin the confines of university policy, the worth of<br />\nthe organization's objective, and the approval of the<br />\nStudent Council.<br />\nStudent affairs funds come from a $20-per-student<br />\ntax yielding approximately $33,000 annually, and a<br />\nsupplemental university grant of $27,500. The Student<br />\nCouncil is allocated $23,000, which it uses to sponsor<br />\ndances, concerts, and the annual Milton S. Eisenhower<br />\nSymposium. All other student organizations combined<br />\nreceive $32,660. For example, the Debate Council<br />\nreceives $3,100, the Music Club, $2,300, WJHU $2,600,<br />\nthe band, $4,300, the H Club, $1,500, and the Free<br />\nUniversity, $150.<br />\nSome organizations, however, such as the News<br />\nLetter, which receives $7,000 per year, are virtually<br />\nself-sustaining. In that case, funds are held over for<br />\n<br />\nfuture or emergency appropriations.<br />\nSeven to eight thousand dollars goes into a<br />\ncontingency fund held by Mr. Bilgrave and administered<br />\nby the Executive Committee of Bilgrave, Passarella, and<br />\nNothstein.<br />\nBilgrave noted that \"the whole purpose of student<br />\nactivities is to get students involved in what they want to<br />\ndo.\" With this philosophy in mind, mid-year<br />\nappropriations for new or floundering organizations are<br />\noften made on an experimental basis\u2014\"Some blossom<br />\nand some fail by the wayside (SIC).

Swanson,<br />\nDean of undergraduate studies, in a discussion of<br />\nthe student role and voice in the Hopkins<br />\n,Community.<br />\nThere are about ten committees of various sorts on<br />\ncampus which have student \"representatives\"on them.<br />\nThese include the library committee, the bookstore<br />\n<br />\nRUSS PASSARELLA, president of the SC, argues that the<br />\nCouncil does serve as a active liason.<br />\n<br />\ncommittee (one meeting during the 68-69 academic<br />\nyear), the committee on the department of Athletics(an<br />\nAd-Hoc committee which has already dissolved),<br />\ncommittee of physical facilities (one two-hour meeting<br />\nduring 68-69), the traffic and parking committee, the<br />\nHomewood Campus Calendar Committee (which Dean<br />\nSwanson described as \"by-passed\"), the committee on<br />\nStudent affairs, the admissions and financial aid<br />\n<br />\ncommittee, and the committee on undergraduate<br />\nstudies.<br />\nUsually, the students on these committees number<br />\none or two, though on the committee for student affairs<br />\nthere are three student \"representatives.\" In nearly all<br />\ncases these \"representatives\" were appointed by the<br />\nStudent Council more specifically by the officers of the<br />\nCouncil. Russ Passarella, the Student Council president,<br />\n\"<br />\nsaid of the situation, \"Manuel and I do the selecting.<br />\nare<br />\np<br />\nmembershi<br />\ncommittee<br />\nfor<br />\nselected<br />\nThe students<br />\nusually drawn from the Student Council and assigned to<br />\ntheir positions as the president sees fit.<br />\nExceptions<br />\nthis method of selecting who<br />\nto<br />\nexception<br />\nOne<br />\nthe<br />\nwill represent the student body was in the case of<br />\nPaul<br />\nAs<br />\nAthletics.<br />\nof<br />\nt<br />\ndepartmen<br />\nthe<br />\ncommittee on<br />\nAllen, a former committee member, described it: \"I got<br />\ne)<br />\na letter from Mr. Bilgrave (chairman of the committe<br />\nduring the summer, asking me if I wanted to be on the<br />\ncommittee. I didn't know anything about it and I don't<br />\nreally have any idea how I was selected.\" Dennis Estis,<br />\nthe other student on the 7-member committee, was<br />\nappointed by Passarella. The committee recently<br />\nfinished its investigation and has since ceased to exist.<br />\nThe committee on Undergraduate studies, chaired<br />\nby Dean Swanson, has 2 students on its 11 member<br />\nroster. When asked if he thought that these two<br />\nsucceeded in voicing the opinions of the student body,<br />\nSwanson replied, \"I have urged that they truly attempt<br />\nto find out what the students want, but they really<br />\nhaven't yet.\" He felt that this hurt the committee,<br />\nmaking it not as \"effective as it might be.\"<br />\nLarry Campbell, a member of the course guide<br />\nstaff, had early in the year expressed interest in being a<br />\nmember of the committee, or at least being able to take<br />\npart in the discussions, since his position on the Course<br />\n.Guide he felt enabled him to have a rather thorough<br />\nknowledge of student feelings in regards to courses. He<br />\nfound out about the first meeting of the committee,<br />\nwhich he attended, and at which he requested that he be<br />\nallowed to sit on the committee, due to his position on<br />\nthe course guide. He was told to talk to Passarella about<br />\nit, which he subsequently did. Since that first meeting,<br />\nthe committee has met once a month, but Campbell has<br />\nnot been notified of any of the meetings. As he put it, \"I<br />\nwas sorta surprised when I found out about the other<br />\nmeetings.\" Larry Campbell is not a member of the<br />\nStudent Council.<br />\nJay Schoenau and Greg Szoka are members of the<br />\n<br />\nbookstore committee, both having been appointed by<br />\nPassarella. The twelve-man committee acts in a purely<br />\nadvisory capacity, as evidenced by its unanimous<br />\ndecision to release the financial figures of the bookstore<br />\nto the undergraduate body, in an attempt to make the<br />\nstudents realize the huge amount of money being lost<br />\ndue to thievery. The vote was merely a recommendation,<br />\nhowever;\"I guess the report will have to be passed along<br />\nto some committee somewhere which has some power,\"<br />\nwas Representative Schoenau's explanation.<br />\nThe feeling of most students who act as<br />\nrepresentatives on the various committees is that they<br />\nhave no power, and little voice. Said one member of a<br />\ncommittee, when asked what he or the committee did,<br />\n\"Not a heck of a lot; it's primarily a public relations<br />\njob.\" Each member emphasized that his committee had<br />\nno real decision-making power, but was merely an<br />\nadvisory group.<br />\nMany of the committees have met only once<br />\nduring the academic year, and some of the others only a<br />\nfew more times than that. The committee on physical<br />\nfacilities is one of the committees that had met only<br />\nonce; that meeting was a discussion of a report prepared<br />\nand presented by Ross Jones, Hopkins Vice-President.<br />\nThe Homewood calendar committee, which has student<br />\nrepresentation, had little or no role in the current<br />\ncalendar reforms. Swanson hoped that in the future<br />\nthere would be \"some student input\", but the<br />\ncommittee at the present time had been \"bypassed.\"<br />\nBesides the obvious problem of the students, on<br />\nthe committees having only an advisory capacity, with<br />\nthe committees serving for the most part as places for \"a<br />\ndialogue,\" rather than an exercise of student power,<br />\nthere is the question of whether the student<br />\n\"representatives\" are truly representative of the student<br />\nbody. Said Swanson concerning this, \"In accepting such<br />\na committee post, the student must accept the<br />\nobligation to be responsible to and representative of the<br />\nstudent body.\"<br />\nMost students, however, do not even know of the<br />\nexistence of the committees, much less their<br />\n\"representatives\" on them. Said one student, \"I guess<br />\ncommittee membership looks good on the law school<br />\napplication form, but no body ever asked me what I<br />\n'thought about the physical facilities or the bookstore.\"<br />\nAdded Dean Swanson, \"It's the student 'representative's'<br />\nresponsibility to sound out the students, or even to ask<br />\nfor other students to be brought in to achieve a better<br />\nrepresentation of the student body.\" \"They really<br />\nhaven't done this to date,\" he added sadly.<br />\n<br />\nCouncil Branded by Dissociation, Stagnation<br />\nBy DAVID HOELSCHER''<br />\nThe Hopkins Student Council,<br />\nlike many councils across the country,<br />\nhas little support from most of the<br />\ncampus activities and little respect from<br />\nthe student body. On the Hopkins<br />\ncampus the dissasociation between the<br />\nCouncil and Hopkins students may be<br />\ntraced to the very conception which<br />\nCouncil members have of their role on<br />\ncampus.<br />\nFundamentally, Russell Passarella,<br />\npresident of the Student Council, stated<br />\nthat the Council today has two<br />\nfunctions. \"The first responsibility is to<br />\nact as a liasion between student<br />\nactivities and the Administration\"<br />\nstated Passarella. In this way the<br />\nCouncil is able to convey information,<br />\npertinent to both the Administration<br />\nand the individual activities.<br />\nThe second role is \"to make<br />\nHopkins a better place.\" Passarella cited<br />\nhis recent activities with the University<br />\nlong-range planning investigations as an<br />\nexample of just such a role. At that<br />\ntime, he attempted to voice a concern<br />\nfor the \"students' point of view,\"<br />\ncalling attention to the lack of<br />\nconsideration for student problems. In<br />\nbringing the student difficulties to the<br />\nattention of the Administration,<br />\nPassarella feels that the Council is able<br />\nto accomplish its goals: to make<br />\nHopkins a better place.<br />\nAccepted Channels<br />\nThe manner in which the Council<br />\nattempts to represent what they see as<br />\nthe student point of view is indicative of<br />\nthe difficulties they face. The president<br />\nof the SC argues that the best way to<br />\ninform the Administration of student<br />\nopinion is not through committee work,<br />\nbut \"by going to the individuals<br />\n<br />\nthemselves and discussing the problems.<br />\nAny other statement on student affairs<br />\nwould be ignored.\" He further stated<br />\nthat many of the decisions to be made<br />\nrequire a good understanding of both<br />\nthe issues and of previous events.<br />\n\"Often I am the only one who is able to<br />\nmake the final decision,\" stated<br />\nPassarella.<br />\nPassarella, and, in fact, the<br />\nStudent Council, attempts to influence<br />\nthe Administration through \"accepted<br />\nchannels\" and with subtle arguments. It<br />\nis basically the accepted approach of<br />\nAdministrators in most Universities and<br />\nthe way in which they affect change.<br />\nThe Hopkins Student Council,<br />\nhowever, in attempting to \"play the<br />\ngame\" loses all of the benefits of being<br />\nstudent group yet gains none of the<br />\nbenefits of not being one. Obviously the<br />\nAdministrators with whom SC members<br />\ncome into contact are more adept to<br />\ninfluence others and less prone to be<br />\ntalked into actions with which they do<br />\nnot completely agree or with which<br />\nthey are not completely sympathetic.<br />\nAn Ancillary Advising Bureau<br />\nThes \"accomplishments\" of the<br />\nStudent Council--that is, those<br />\naccomplishments falling in the area of<br />\ninnovative actions--are basically<br />\nAdministration accomplishments. The<br />\nrole of the Student Council becomes, it<br />\nappears, purely an ancillary advising<br />\nbureau.<br />\nThe Council, however, is also<br />\nunable to mobilize any widely based<br />\nsupport for itself from the student<br />\nbody. Because the Council attempts to<br />\nwork with the Administration, it is seen<br />\nas less than a dynamic force on campus.<br />\nTherefore, students who want to offer<br />\nnew and different ideas hesitate to<br />\npresent them before the Council.<br />\n<br />\nFor this reason the Council has<br />\nsubstantial difficulties examining<br />\n\"student opinion.\" Under these adverse<br />\nconditions Passarella tends to depend on<br />\npersonal contacts with fellow students<br />\nas a means of \"sampling\" student<br />\nopinion. It becomes evident what is<br />\nmeant when he states that \"you have to<br />\njust sum up how you perceive reactions<br />\nto issues,\" and how he can state that<br />\n\"people you respect play an important<br />\nrole.\"<br />\nThe Student Council is laboring<br />\nunder a third force which is equally<br />\noppressing: the purely bureaucratic<br />\nfunctions of the Council which leave<br />\nlittle time for creative approaches to old<br />\nproblems.<br />\nBSU Referendum<br />\nThe Black Students Union<br />\nreferendum is one example of such a<br />\nbottleneck. Passarella stated that a<br />\nreferendum on the rejection of the BSU<br />\non account of its discriminatory<br />\npractices was held off because the<br />\nSymposium on Latin American Affairs<br />\n\"took all our time.\" It is evident from<br />\nthis statement, therefore, that all<br />\nactivities of the Council ceased between<br />\nThanksgiving and the Christmas<br />\nvacation because of the program. Such<br />\nan administrative bog can only increase<br />\nthe ineffectiveness of the Council and<br />\nthe difficulties of implimenting change.<br />\nThese three causes of the<br />\nCouncil's ineffectiveness--their<br />\nrelationship with the Administration,<br />\nthe resulting alienation of many<br />\nsegments of the student body and the<br />\nadministrative bottleneck--have<br />\ndrastically effected it's decisions.<br />\nEssentially it appears that those<br />\ndecisions have been made in isolation<br />\nfrom much of the campus.<br />\nWhen a decision must be made<br />\n<br />\nrequiring consideration of \"campus<br />\nopinion\" or \"campus sentiment\" the<br />\nCouncil labors under great difficulties.<br />\nThis difficulty becomes evident when,<br />\nfor example, choices for concerts are<br />\nexamined.<br />\nBalance of Quality<br />\nPassarella stated that he wants a<br />\n\"balance of quality\" in the concerts<br />\npresented on campus: \"every taste in<br />\nmusic should be represented.\" The<br />\nCouncil has, to some extent, managed<br />\nto do just that and many different<br />\ngroups have been represented at<br />\nHomewood. The quality of that<br />\nrepresentation, however, may be<br />\nquestioned.<br />\nThere is little question about the<br />\nreputation of either Sergio Mendes or<br />\nCount Basic, both groups are among the<br />\nuncontested leaders of their musical<br />\nstyle. The Vanilla Fudge, on the other<br />\nhand, is regarded by most as no more<br />\nthan an average group. There is, at the<br />\nsame time, some evidence that the<br />\nCouncil could have booked groups<br />\nrepresenting the best in the rock and<br />\nhard rock area, much more<br />\neconomically.<br />\nThe failure of the Student Council<br />\nto recognize the mediocrity of the<br />\nFudge is understandable and no<br />\ncomment should or can be made about<br />\nit; their failure to consult people who<br />\nwere aware of such distinction is less<br />\nunderstandable.<br />\nThis seems to be the major<br />\ndifficulty with the Student Council. The<br />\nCouncil is not inept at their job (many<br />\nof the accomplishments of the Council<br />\nthis year have been impressive) but it is<br />\nclear, on the other hand, that it<br />\nfunctions as a specific -interest group<br />\nand shows little overt desire to alter this<br />\nsituation.<br />\n<br />\n\fPAGE 8<br />\n<br />\nNEWS-LETTER<br />\n<br />\nHOMEWOOD, BALTIMORE, FEB. 21, 1969<br />\n<br />\nNew Left Analysis<br />\n<br />\nS Fights NLF for Control Of Southeast Asia<br />\nBy STEPHEN SHRIVER<br />\n<br />\nAny discussion of the Vietnamese Peace<br />\nNegotiations currently under way in Paris must<br />\nbe seen in the context of the struggle between<br />\nthe United States on the one hand and the<br />\nNational Liberation Front and the Democratic.<br />\nRepublic of Vietnam on the other over the<br />\ncontrol of the destiny of South East Asia.<br />\nThe U.S. is seeking to maintain its control over the<br />\neconomy and resources of the area in order to enable<br />\nlarge-scale corporate investments and the development<br />\nof new .markets crucial for the necessary expansion of<br />\nthe American economy. This means control of the<br />\nnational resources (e.g. 50 million tons of tungsten), the<br />\nguarantee of a low-cost labor force, and a stable political<br />\nclimate conducives to low tax rates, the orderly.<br />\ndevelopment of markets and the containment of any<br />\npolitical resistance to this domination and exploitation.<br />\nThe United States maintains the facade of national<br />\nindependence and self-determination by maintaining in<br />\npower, through total military, economic and political<br />\nsupport, obligarchical military dictatorships.(Kittachorn<br />\nin Thailand, Thieu-Ky in South Vietnam) which are<br />\nbased heavily on the landlord class. In attempting to<br />\nsuppress the Vietnamese revolution, the United States is<br />\ntrying to suppress a major challenge to this system of.<br />\ninternational economic domination, and thereby<br />\nmaintain and enhance its position of world hegemony.<br />\nHowever, given the fact that the U.S. forces and<br />\nthe Saigon Government can only claim, in reality, to<br />\ncontrol the major cities, that, in fact, the \"allies\" have<br />\nsuffered a solid defeat throughout most of the country<br />\nat the hands of the NLF and even in the cities are in an<br />\nincreasingly tenuous position; and given the strong and<br />\ncontinuously rising tide of national and international<br />\nopinion opposing the U.S. policies in Vietnam, the<br />\nAmerican Government is hoping to achieve a working,<br />\nneutral compromise in Paris similar to that worked out<br />\nfor Laos in 1962 in Geneva. Under such a compromise<br />\nthe U.S. would continue to pursue its economic and<br />\npolitical goals in Vietnam under the threat of<br />\nre-intervention to contain \"communist aggression and<br />\nsubversion\". That such re-intervention is likely is evident<br />\nfrom its massive bombing of Laos and continued<br />\nmilitary and CIA support of rightist forces within that<br />\ncountry, as well as from the tremendous investment that<br />\nthe U.S. has expended in creating the huge military<br />\nenclaves along the coast of Vietnam and in Thailand.<br />\nThe NLF, mindful of the repeated violation of the<br />\nGeneva Agreements by the U.S., is fully determined to<br />\nfight until the last American leaves Vietnamese soil.<br />\nThey are fighting a war which has lasted for more than<br />\ntwenty years for their national liberation and<br />\nindependence. They seek to expel foreigns and<br />\nforeign-dominated control of their nation and enable<br />\nthe Vietnamese people to control their own economy<br />\nand politics and thereby to determine their own destiny.<br />\nThey also seek to take power from the Vietnamerse<br />\nruling landlord class and thereby enable the average<br />\npeasant and poor Vietnamese to control his own life and<br />\nthe destiny of the nation. These goals of the Vietnamese<br />\nrevolution are diametrically opposed to the goals of the<br />\nAmerican intervention.<br />\nTherefore, the immediate aims of the U.S. in the<br />\ntalks are the neutralization and sealing of the.<br />\nDemilitarized Zone, the withdrawal of North<br />\nVietnamese troops from the South, and the holding of<br />\nelections for a \"new\" South Vietnamese government. In<br />\nthe first place, this is an attempt to win at the<br />\nconference table what the U.S. has not been able to win<br />\non the battleield.<br />\nSeconds, however, the two aspects of these aims,<br />\nthe military and the political, comprise part of a larger<br />\nstrategy to maintain U.S. control over and safeguard<br />\nU.S. interests and long-range goals in the area. By sealing<br />\nof the DMZ and forcing the withdrawal of DRV troops,<br />\nthe U.S. would hope to seriously hamper the operations<br />\nof the People's Liberation Armed Forces (military arm<br />\nof the NLF). Were these aims achieved, the U.S. figures<br />\nthat its current escalations would be far more effective,<br />\nin terms of guaranteeing a victory for pro-U.S. forces in<br />\nany \"elections\" which may come out of the Paris talks<br />\n(the second U.S. aim in the talks). The U.S. has used<br />\n\"elections\" in the past to legitimize the dictatorships<br />\nthrough which it has maintained its control of South<br />\nVietnam, and would continue to do so in the future as<br />\nthe safest way to accomplish its goals.<br />\nThe current escalations since the bombing halt<br />\nhave been aimed primarily at destroying the NLF<br />\ninfrastructure in the countryside, thereby eliminating<br />\n<br />\nthe organized opposition to the Saigon regime. Indeed,<br />\nthis has been the U.S.-Saigon strategy ever since the<br />\nascendency of Diem to power.<br />\nThese newest attacks are four-pronged. The first is<br />\n\"Operation Phoenix,\" the aim of which is to assassinate<br />\n80,000 NLF local cadres using special CIA-trained<br />\ncommando units. The second prong is the removal of<br />\nmasses of peasants into government-controlled<br />\nrelocation camps wheres they can be interrogated,<br />\nguarded and claimed as \"friendly\" hamlets. An<br />\noperation last month north of Danang rounded up 2500<br />\npeople, half of the target district's population. The third<br />\nprong of this strategy is a quick-pacification effort which<br />\nis attempting to plant the Saigon flag in as many hamlets<br />\nas possible in as short a time as possible. This is designed<br />\nto recoup the massive losses suffered by the \"allies\" in<br />\nlast year's Tet offensive and thereby give legitimacy to<br />\nthe Saigon regime at Paris. The fourth prong is a<br />\ntremendous increase in the bombing of the<br />\nNLF-controlled areas in the South. Since the bombing<br />\nhalt of the North, the bombing rate has tripled.<br />\nAt the same time, the American public is being<br />\nsounded out for its response to a larger escalation<br />\nplanned for the future in an attempt to win the war<br />\nmilitarily. Charles Mohr of the New York Times wrote<br />\n<br />\nseveral articles in January citing \"usually reliable sources<br />\n(i.e., the daily '5 o'clock follies' newsbriefings at the<br />\nPentagon East in Saigon, and the CIA) which claimed<br />\nthat the \"allies\" had made excellent gains in the war and<br />\nthat the war could be won if only the public would have<br />\nthe patience to allow the generals to prosecute the war<br />\nfully. The New York Times has traditionally floated<br />\nthese trial ballons for the Pentagon, primarily under the<br />\nby-line of the military affairs expert, Hanson Baldwin.<br />\nSimultaneously, the U.S. is spending much money<br />\nand manpower in an attempt to upgrade the Saigon<br />\nArmy. Such development would permit the U.S. to<br />\nwithdraw some of its troops, claiming de-escalation<br />\nwhile, in effect, the war was escalating.<br />\nThe third aim of the U.S. in the Paris talks is<br />\ndeliberate attempt to distract public opinion to gain<br />\nmaneuvering room for this continued escalation. Seen in<br />\nthe light of the contest between the government and its<br />\nlarge and troublesome opposition at home, Johnson's<br />\nwithdrawal from the presidential race, the bombing halts<br />\nand the start of the talks have been a tremendously<br />\nsuccessfuly publics relations gamble to silence the<br />\noppostiion and defuse the anti-war movement.

The DRV<br />\nagreed to the bombing halt in order to take the eyes of<br />\nthe world off the battle between the \"big\" powers (the<br />\nU.S. and the DRV) and to localize the focus to the real<br />\nand original struggle in the South. The North agreed to<br />\nParticipate in the talks in order to show the dependency<br />\nof the Saigon regime ons thes United States and<br />\nsupplementarily, to provde an international platform for<br />\nthe NLF to prove itself the legitimate representative of<br />\nthe people of South Vietnam.<br />\nTo this extent, the haggling over the shape of the<br />\ntable, Saigon's participation and recognition of the NLF<br />\nwere all significant. Ithe hair-splitting symbolism of<br />\ndiplomacy, thes roundness of the conference table<br />\nstructures the NLF as an equal participant in the talks.<br />\nThe NLF's independence, and concommitantly Saigon's<br />\ndependence on the U.S., is symbolized by the fact that<br />\n<br />\nthe heads of the NLF and DRV delegations sit in the<br />\nmiddle of their respective delegations, while the chief<br />\nnegotiators for Saigon and the U.S. sit at the other end<br />\nof their respective delegations, next to each other.<br />\nIn the actual negotiations, the DRV has repeatedly<br />\ndeferred to the NLF, thus continually trying to focus<br />\nand<br />\nattention on the NLF by allowing it the major role<br />\nfurther consternating the \"allies.\"<br />\nThe NLF is participating in the Paris Negotiations<br />\nis the<br />\nin order to publicly and formally show that it<br />\nm<br />\nVietna<br />\nSouth<br />\nlegitimate representative of the people of<br />\ns<br />\nSaigon'<br />\nof<br />\nss<br />\nemptine<br />\nthe<br />\nwhile concomitantly showing<br />\nly<br />\nstaunch<br />\nhas<br />\nNLF<br />\nthe<br />\nend,<br />\nthis<br />\nTo<br />\nclaim to such title.<br />\nits five<br />\nand consistently maintained its position: that<br />\ne<br />\ncomplet<br />\nthe<br />\nis<br />\npoints or demands, chief of which<br />\nbasis<br />\nthe<br />\nbe<br />\nel,<br />\npersonn<br />\nand<br />\nwithdrawal of all U.S. forces<br />\nfor any negotiations.<br />\nl<br />\nThe NLF is using the Paris talks as a politica<br />\nFirst,<br />\npeople.<br />\nof<br />\nforum directed at three different groups<br />\nliberated<br />\nit is attempting to consolidate its base in the<br />\ngains,<br />\nmilitary<br />\nand<br />\nl<br />\npolicica<br />\nits<br />\nhen<br />\nareas and to strengt<br />\nMay<br />\nand<br />\nTet<br />\nthe<br />\nduring<br />\nmades<br />\nthose<br />\nespecially<br />\nd<br />\nrelegate<br />\nforces<br />\nOffensive.

Because they have been relatively untouched by<br />\nthe war, many of theses people haves remained<br />\nuncommitted to either side. The NLF is attempting,<br />\ntherefore, to complete its overall, long-term strategy of<br />\nuniting all sects, ethnic groups and classes in a struggle<br />\nagainst the Saigon dictatorship, the landlords and the<br />\naggressing foreign powers for national liberation.<br />\nThe third group which concerns the NLF is the<br />\ninternational public, and especially the U.S. public.<br />\nThrough its forum in Paris, the NLF hopes to strengthen<br />\ninternational public opinion against the War and<br />\nAmerican imperialism. Its prime hope in this area is that<br />\nthe American people will repudiate the policies of \"the<br />\nAmerican ruling class\" and force the withdrawal of the<br />\nUnited States from Vietnam. In this light it is significant<br />\nthat the American press, even the generally thorough New<br />\nYork Times few or none of themany statements the<br />\nNLF issues in Paris.

Through breakfast<br />\nseminars at Levering Hall, detailed survey of the<br />\nHomewood community and committee reports on local<br />\nfacilities, Mrs. Kline has tried to bring forward some<br />\nplans for action.<br />\nSummer Creatice Crafts<br />\nThe two most striking deficiencies in the<br />\nHomewood area were found to be in education and<br />\nrecreation. HCP-sponsored programs have partially met<br />\nthe two problems. They were initiated when there were<br />\nno other organizations already established to deal with<br />\nthe problem. \"When we discover a pressing need, we will<br />\ntry to solve it to our best ability,\" Mrs. Kline noted. Last<br />\nsummer the project developed a reading and creative<br />\ncrafts program for 85 children in local elementary<br />\nschools. \"We found that many children were far behind<br />\non their reading ability, and the creative arts was an<br />\nincentive for them to come to school during their<br />\nvacation,\" she recalled. The project was staffed mainly<br />\nby volunteer wives anda few Hopkins students with the<br />\nlessons prepared by Helen Goodwin, the director of<br />\nreading at Morgan State College. The in-the-field director<br />\nof the reading program was Hopkins student Paul<br />\nChurchill. \"The program was really successful,\" he said.<br />\n<br />\nChurchill is no longer a worker for the organization.<br />\nIn the other field, Mrs. Mine said that in the<br />\nRemington area near Homewood they found no<br />\nrecreational facilities or school playgrounds. \"We were<br />\nable to get some space from two churches in the<br />\ncommunity,\" Mrs. Kline stated. Recently, with the help<br />\nof the student-run Community Involvement Board, the<br />\nHCP acted as the \"broker\" in recruiting about 18<br />\nstudent basketball and wrestling instructors for<br />\nRemington from Hopkins. Mrs. Kline also mentioned<br />\ntheir requests to City Hall for better local recreation and<br />\nincreased residential use of the Hopkins' gym.<br />\nUnlike most of the projects run by Levering Hall,<br />\nthe HCP does not deal with Inner City problems. In fact<br />\nMrs. Kline said she was at first \"amazed\" by the dearth<br />\nof student or other programs in the immediate<br />\nenvironment surrounding Hopkins. \"We see no point in<br />\nbeing competitive with the Inner City projects,\" the<br />\nHCP Director emphasized.\"We think that it is important<br />\nto maintain this area\" which she claims is going through<br />\nadjustment pains. \"We want the quality of life<br />\nMaintained and not to go down if the neighborhood goes<br />\nblack,\" she stated.<br />\nIn reply to some critics that say the HCP is a<br />\ncoverup for keeping out blacks, Mrs. Kline heatedly<br />\ndeclared, \"That is absolutely false.

This fact would<br />\nseem curious in view of the Council's relative competence in rendering services to the<br />\nundergraduate body. However, one is less puzzled if one takes into account the very<br />\nsystem in which the Council operates. Effective action on its responsibility to provide<br />\nservices requires that the Council work in close conjunction and in a spirit of absolute<br />\ncooperation with the administration, which controls the University's funding.<br />\n<br />\nBRUCE DRAKE,DENNIS ESTIS<br />\nEditors-in-Chief<br />\nJAMES FRANKE., DAVID COOPER<br />\nBusiness Managers<br />\n4.<br />\n<br />\nSymptoms and Simpletons<br />\nThe Hopkins Student Council, as the campus' only representative undergraduate<br />\nbody, is under two major obligations to its 1700 constituents. Though the activities of<br />\nthe Council are many, they are divisible into the categories of service functions and<br />\nrepresentative functions.<br />\nBy service functions, we mean that the Council is expected to provide for the social<br />\nlife of the Hopkins undergraduate with mixers, concerts and with arrangements for<br />\nbig weekends.\" In addition, under service functions, we would place such activities as<br />\nthe Speakers Bureau, the undergraduate telephone directory, the Student Council<br />\nCalendar and the supervision of various student activities.<br />\nThe Student Association, in its recent decision to devote itself less to providing<br />\nservices and more to off-campus involvement, recognized the Council's responsibility<br />\nfor service functions. In addition, the SA was acknowledging that the Council is<br />\nsuperiorly staffed and equipped to handle these matters. The Council, on the whole,<br />\nhas managed this function \u2022 competently. Though there may be disagreement about<br />\nmany of the decisions which had to be made in fulfilling this obligation to the student<br />\nbody, we submit that there are few (the News-Letter certainly not among them) who<br />\nwould contend that the Council has failed them here.<br />\nHowever, there is another aspect to the Council's functions\u2014those activities which<br />\nare representative. It is in this area that we have frequently taken issue with the<br />\nCouncil and we find that most other criticisms of that body deal with actions in this<br />\nrealm as well.<br />\nBy representative functions, we mean that the Council has three responsibilities in<br />\nits role as the administration's source of student \"input.\" The three functions are:<br />\nfirst, to responsibly ascertain the opinions of the student body;second,to present the<br />\nmajority opinion with all possible force in meetings with the administration and to<br />\nWork for the implementation of the students' requests; and third, to accurately inform<br />\nthe students with regard to events and opinions which will affect \"the man in the<br />\nquad.\"<br />\nIt is in this latter set of functions that we contend the Council has failed. If we<br />\nexamine the Council's three responsibilities in this area, deficiencies are readily<br />\napparent. It would seem as though Russell Passarella simply is not interested in<br />\nexploring the attitudes of the campus in their diversity. In an earlier editorial, we<br />\nquestioned the ability of any one person to gauge \"student opinion.\" At that time, we<br />\nrecommended referendum as the means to improve the situation. But even if one man<br />\ncannot know the opinions of all, one can try harder than Passarella has. The best that a<br />\nstudent can hope for now, in the way of getting his views across, is to have his SC<br />\nPresident overhear him, as the former talks it all over with Dean Rudoy or Mike Amey.<br />\nEven assuming that Passarella has developed a technique for opinion gathering by osmosis, there is considerable evidence (like the lack of any results, for instance) to<br />\nsuggest that he presents the students' views to the administration with almost no force.<br />\nWhen administrators inevitably pick Passarella or another Council member as the<br />\nexpressor of student views, it is with the comforting knowledge that discussion will be<br />\nheld in a spirit of perfect harmony.<br />\nFinally, as to reporting back to the students whom he omnisciently reflects,<br />\nPassarella demonstrates the administrator's techniques more than their views.<br />\nEmerging from the important meeting which dealt with student representation on the<br />\nAcademic Council, he revealed that the discussion had been \"very frank.\" That such a<br />\nfrank discussion with the University's top policy-makers should have occasioned so<br />\nlittle comment from our \"representative\" is inexcusable.<br />\n<br />\nI AP311361Ze<br />\nFOR 1-1IJAC4106<br />\nYOUR<br />\n<br />\nAIRRAIJE,<br />\n<br />\nAfX THEY toosr<br />\nay& HE STATE<br />\nt2WE FfRHISIotO<br />\nDECAUS5 I'M A<br />\nSTWEr AIJD<br />\nNOT YOuRikKISTL 60 I'M<br />\nIJOt QUALIF(cp<br />\nTO 1-AR)<br />\nABOUT CUBA<br />\nEDP_ MYSELF.<br />\n<br />\nPAGE 11<br />\n<br />\nNEWS-LETTER<br />\n<br />\nPUT I'M A<br />\nSTUPEur<br />\nANP<br />\nWAMTEP<br />\nTO<br />\ni,EARK)<br />\nABOUT<br />\nCUBA<br />\nFOR<br />\nMy5ELF.<br />\n<br />\nco TO<br />\nCOME<br />\nNuME<br />\n<br />\nFRGH<br />\nCUBA<br />\nI HAVE<br />\nTO FIRT<br />\n&T0<br />\n!4WD.<br />\n<br />\nOn the other hand, to effectively represent the students, when dealing with the<br />\nadministration on larger matters, it is often required that the representatives stand<br />\napart from the administration. Indeed, an effective representative must be able to<br />\nstand apart from the entire process of fulfilling day to day functional requirements.<br />\nIn other words, larger questions (calendar reform, providing for an effective student<br />\nvoice in decision making, the relation of research to the University's teaching function)<br />\nrequire a more detached outlook\u2014a larger outlook which should not be restricted by<br />\nthe attempt to work in perfect harmony. Harmony, in fact, should always be<br />\nsecondary to the effort to provide effective and enlightened leadership.<br />\nIt is in this leadership function that we see the Council's inadequacy. To a certain<br />\nextent, it is not only this Council which has failed to deal with the larger questions of<br />\nstudent interest. Passarella, in fact, is no worse than his predecessors. He has a wide<br />\nacquaintance which he might sample to determine opinions. He can express an idea if<br />\nhe ever has one (and probably could in the presence of administrators\u2014as long as it<br />\nwouldn't offend them). And he is fond of demonstrating that he is not averse to<br />\ntalking (though not about what goes on in important meetings).<br />\nThe point is that he is capable of acting responsibly as a representative. However,<br />\nseveral factors prevent his or the Council's ever really becoming effective. First, as has<br />\nbeen mentioned, Council members and the administration need to work closely on<br />\nmatters of day to day administrative functions. The growing amoeba of red tape<br />\nvirtually ingests Council members along with the ideas they campaigned on. Working<br />\nlike an administrator, he almost becomes an administrator.<br />\nSecond and equally important is the consideration of the type of people who are<br />\nelected to the Council. One could acknowledge that Passarella and crew aren't going to<br />\ntry to change anything, but what about next year? We contend that next year will be<br />\nthe same, just as last year was. Council candidates are most often judged on the merits<br />\nof the Shipwreck Ball. To a large extent, campaigns are waged in terms of\"more pool<br />\ntables and better food.\"<br />\nStudent Council candidates must campaign on promises to deliver\u2014the major part of<br />\ntheir appeal must be on the grounds of the concrete. In addition, when they became<br />\nCouncil members, they are judged in terms of their measurable accomplishments.<br />\nWhen students know nothing of how decisions are reached at the University they<br />\ncannot be expected to look into a candidate's ideas. In short the very system in which<br />\nthe Council operates insures that members devote most of their energy to service<br />\nfunctions, it makes it difficult for members to approach service questions and the<br />\nlarger representative questions in different manners and finally it insures that the<br />\npeople elected will be good at delivering and not necessarily as representatives<br />\n<br />\ncommunicating important opinions.<br />\nOnly if the members of the Council underwent a remaable change of heart could<br />\none expect significant alteration within the present system to remedy this situation.<br />\nSuch a change of heart seems not to be forthcoming. We contend that the path toward<br />\na solution of this problem leads from other groups and individuals on the campus. In<br />\nthe future, we shall present our own alternatives to the present system. It would be<br />\nalmost unfair to expect the very members of the present self-perpetuating set-up to<br />\nprovide for the system's destruction or change. However, the change is possible, it is<br />\nrequired, and it lacks only the attention of the community at large.<br />\nIn a sense, change of a larger nature is at stake here as well.

His sources of<br />\nimportance were a musical voice, a<br />\nseries of platform gestures, an easy<br />\ncolloquial manner of discourse, and<br />\nsuch respectability as he could derive<br />\nfrom being the scion of an old New<br />\nEngland family and having the<br />\nacquaintance of such literary types as<br />\nEmerson.<br />\nAdded Notice<br />\nIt need hardly be added that<br />\nHistory has seen many agitators and has<br />\npaused to note only a few of them.<br />\nPhillips merits added notice because so<br />\nmany of his radical proposals have since<br />\nbeen hardened into law. Prior to the<br />\nCivil War he was concerned with<br />\nAbolition; afterwards he insisted that<br />\nthe Federal government had to provide<br />\nfor the civil and economic rights of the<br />\nfreedmen, and also advocated<br />\namelioration of the condition of<br />\nworkingmen and the organization and<br />\nrecognition of strong labor unions.<br />\nThere is no specific piece of<br />\nlegislation which one may consider<br />\npassed because of Phillips' oratory, but<br />\nif the function of agitators is to inject<br />\ntheir advanced positions into the<br />\npolitical conciousness so as to hasten<br />\nthe time when they may be acted on,<br />\nthen future generations did nobly by<br />\nWendell Phillips. In any event, it is safe<br />\nto say that he had more influence than a<br />\ncitizen whose only political act may be<br />\nto vote. But Phillips did not vote.<br />\nIndeed, in 1877 he boasted of this from<br />\nthe platform.<br />\n<br />\nNo Objections<br />\nIn a private letter, he explained<br />\nthat in his early life he did not object to<br />\nvoting, but did not keep the same<br />\nresidence long enough to ever be able to<br />\ndo so. After acquiring his Abolitionist<br />\nconvictions, he did not feel he could<br />\nvote for a government in which slaves<br />\nwere prohibited from voting. The<br />\nfifteenth Amendment erased this<br />\nobjection, but since then Mr. Phillips<br />\nhad voted only once, simply because he<br />\ndid not find the candidates very<br />\nattractive.<br />\nIt is rather puzzling to read that<br />\nPhillips had cast one vote, rather than<br />\ntwo. In 1871 he was associated with the<br />\nMassachusetts gubernatorial campaign<br />\nof General Benjamin F. Butler and<br />\npresumably voted for Butler (After<br />\nyears of trying, General Butler achieved<br />\nthe Massachusetts executive office in<br />\n1882).<br />\n<br />\nGubernatorial Candidate<br />\nPhillips himself had been the<br />\ngubernatorial candidate of a small labor<br />\nparty. It is to be hoped that Phillips was<br />\nnot sufficiently overconfident as to fail<br />\nto vote for himself. The final returns<br />\nshowed that Phillips not only had no<br />\nvotes to spare, but required many more<br />\n-yen to make his party competitive.<br />\nSeriously, however, there are<br />\ninconsistencies in Phillips' position. If<br />\nhe did not consider the government<br />\nworthy of soliciting his participation in<br />\nan election, in which he could have<br />\nsupported a reasonably radical group<br />\nsuch as the Free Soilers, one wonders<br />\nwhy he considered it worthy of being<br />\nagitated against. Such agitators as<br />\nPhillips created the moral climate in<br />\nwhich the , Free Soil party and the<br />\nRepublican party grew. Even though<br />\nthese parties did not advocate Southern<br />\nemancipation, Phillips stands in the<br />\nposition of preparing the ground for<br />\nthem and then failing to aid them with<br />\nhis vote.<br />\nIt is not hard, but easy, to refuse<br />\n<br />\nVISTA VISITS<br />\nA representative from<br />\nVISTA (VOLUNTEERS IN SERVICE TO AMERICA<br />\nwill be in<br />\n<br />\nLEVERING HALL<br />\nMONDAY,FEBRUARY 24 and TUESDAY,FEBRUARY 25<br />\nto discuss the VISTA programs<br />\n\u2022<br />\n<br />\nTHE CATHOLIC COMMUNITY<br />\nON CAMPUS<br />\nLENTEN SEMINAR WEDNESDAYS 7:30 P.M.<br />\n\"THE 'NERESIES'OF THE DUTCH CATECHISM\"<br />\nNEWMAN HOUSE<br />\n<br />\n2941 N.

All candidates<br />\nare likely to be fallible and to be guilty<br />\nof mistakes in the past; no seeker after<br />\nelection victory can afford to get as far<br />\nahead of public opinion as an agitator<br />\nsuch as Phillips.<br />\n<br />\nMake A Choice<br />\nStill, a choice must be made,<br />\nsomeone must hold office, and it is not<br />\ntrue that all the candidates before<br />\nPhillips were equally unfriendly to the<br />\ngeneral tenor of his opinions.<br />\nIn 1800 Alexander Hamilton had<br />\nto decide whether to influence<br />\nFederalist members of the House of<br />\nRepresentatives to vote for Jefferson or<br />\nBurr for President. He scorned Jefferson<br />\nas \"a contemptible,\" \"an atheist in<br />\nreligion and a fanatic in politics,\" but he<br />\nalso felt that Burr would lead to war,<br />\ncorruption and usurpation of authority<br />\n<br />\nand he chose Jefferson. For Hamilton to<br />\nhave declined to make a choice because<br />\nof his objections to both men would<br />\nhave indicated, not high moral stature,<br />\nbut a lack of concern with the national<br />\nwelfare.<br />\nHaving proposed reforms, Phillips<br />\nscorned the choice of men who might<br />\nhave the power to execute his proposals.<br />\nIt was as if he expected to achieve<br />\nreform through moral force alone.<br />\nPerhaps, however, Phillips'<br />\naversion to voting should be considered<br />\nan act of political chastity, a refusal to<br />\nconsort with what he considered a.<br />\nflawed body politic. In itself, failure to<br />\nvote accomplishes nothing. But Mr.<br />\nPhillips was not considered practical,<br />\nand this particular symbolic protest was<br />\nentirely in character.<br />\n<br />\nJagger,Stones,<br />\nExcite Levine<br />\nBy ART LEVINE<br />\nThe Rolling Stones' new album,<br />\nBeggar's Banquet, is filled with the same<br />\nraw, erotic energy that has endeared<br />\nthem to horny girls the world over. The<br />\nStones are at their decadent, evil best in<br />\nthis album, an album flavored with<br />\ncalypso, folk, country and western, and<br />\ngospel motifs, as well as blues and hard<br />\nrock. Furthermore, Jagger proves<br />\nhimself to be a lyricist of extraordinary<br />\nability in quite a few of the cuts. The<br />\nStones have, in any case, recaptured the<br />\nraunchiness that has made them the Bad<br />\nBoys of rock.<br />\nThe Stones have always had a<br />\nviolent, hood image in the rock field.<br />\nOn their record albums they struck<br />\ndark, sullen poses, their shoulder length<br />\nhair framing faces that scowled at.the<br />\nviewer. In their lifestyle, too,- they<br />\nexhibited the same evil ways. They were<br />\nthe first rock group that everyone was<br />\nsure used drugs. They were rumored to<br />\nbe fags, and yet, at the same time, both<br />\nKeith Richard and Brian Jones were<br />\ninvolved in paternity suits. Scandal is<br />\ncommon to the Stones.<br />\nAbove all, they are sexy. Mick<br />\nJagger, although he has been compared<br />\nto an ugly Vassar girl, was, and still is,<br />\nthe reigning white rock and roll stud.<br />\n(Jim Morrison learned this the hard<br />\nway. At a California concert he shouted,<br />\n\"What do you want?\" and the crowd<br />\nresponded, \"Mick Jagger!\"). In his live<br />\nperformances, Jagger, borrowing a few<br />\ntricks from black soul singers, writhes<br />\nacross the stage, using the mike as a<br />\nphallic extension. Jagger, however, is a<br />\nlittle too conscious of his image, as he is<br />\nknown to stuff his pants with toilet<br />\npaper before a performance in order to<br />\nappear a little fuller in the crotch.<br />\n<br />\nInternally Grate-Full<br />\nMusically, too, the Stones are not<br />\nknown for their refined taste. Raunchy<br />\nsongs like \"Satisfaction,\" \"Let's Spend<br />\nthe Night Together,\" and \"Get Off of<br />\nMy Cloud,\" exhibit a crudity upsetting<br />\nto many. Their best genre, in my mind,<br />\nis their \"slut\" song, where they take<br />\nsome dumb broad and proceed to dump<br />\n<br />\nall over her. Songs like \"Stupid Girl,\"<br />\n\"Under My Thumb,\" and \"Back Street<br />\nGirl\" show exactly what they think of<br />\nall the groupies that are part of the rock<br />\nscene. Futhermore, even their recording<br />\njobs are sloppy, adding yet another<br />\ndimension of crudity to the Stones.<br />\nJagger has the irritating down-home<br />\nhabit of mumbling his words, giving<br />\nmost of their records the sparkling<br />\nclarity ofs a Mississippi Delta Field<br />\nrecording. They are, in a word, slobs.<br />\nThis is in great contrast to the<br />\nother reigning rock group, the Beatles.<br />\nThe Beatles, even though they also took<br />\ndrugs, present a much cleaner image.<br />\nThey are more akin to the hippies, while<br />\nthe Stones are closer to the Liverpool<br />\nToughs. Yet, the Stones are undeniable<br />\nsecond to the Beatles, and indeed have<br />\nfollowed the Beatles' lead, just like<br />\neverybody else. Most obviously, the<br />\nStones' atrocious attempt at<br />\npsychedelia, Their Satanic Majesties'<br />\nRequest, was clearly influenced by Sgt.<br />\nPepper's. They have paralleled the<br />\nBeatles in this latest album by returning<br />\nto an earlier stage as the Beatles have<br />\ndone. The contrast with the Beatles is<br />\nmost strikingly apparent by comparing<br />\ntwo recent singles, \"Revolution\" and<br />\n\"Street Fighting Man.\" The first is a<br />\nclear rejection of violence, while the<br />\nlatter is an appeal for violence and<br />\nrevolution. The Beatles, unlike the<br />\nStones, are out of favor with<br />\nGuardian-type dogmatists of the left.<br />\nThe first thing that strikes you<br />\nabout the album is the unity; it is an<br />\nartistic whole. There is none of the<br />\nchoppiness that mars the Beatles' latest<br />\neffort. The album is, fortunately,<br />\nblessed by a total dearth of bombs. The<br />\nbest song in the album is probably<br />\n\"Sympathy for the Devil.\" It is<br />\nmarvelously rythmic, starting off with<br />\ncontrapuntal voodoo drums, and then<br />\nthe wild screams and grunts of the<br />\nStones are heard. Then Jagger's voice<br />\ncomes in, the embodiment of evil, the<br />\nDevil himself:<br />\n(Continued to Page 13)<br />\n<br />\nRegular Mass Schedule<br />\n<br />\nSENIORS<br />\n<br />\nSUNDAYS ..10:30 A.M.- Shaffer Hall Rm.3<br />\nWEEKDAYS 12:05 PM.- Levering Hall Chapel<br />\n<br />\nTHE SCHOOL OF SOCIAL WORK AT UNIVERSITY OF<br />\nMARYLAND OFFERS A FULLY ACCREDITED<br />\nPROGRAM LEADING TO THE MASTERS DEGREE IN<br />\nSOCIAL WORK.

What joy sets them apart?\"<br />\nThe First Circle by Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn,<br />\nformer prisoner (zek) is the finest single piece of<br />\nliterature to come out of the Soviet Union in this<br />\ndecade.<br />\nIn 1962, Solzhenitsyn published his first major<br />\nwork, One Day in the Life ofIvan Denisovich, the story<br />\n0<br />\n. f a camp zek, a prison laborer condemned to an<br />\nindefinite term of weary starvation and cold in a<br />\nSiberian labor camp. In many ways, The First Circle is a<br />\nmore perfect rewrite of the previous work. The time<br />\nspan is drawn out to four days, the character sketches<br />\nare extended out from the prisoners to the guards, the<br />\nadministators, the wives<br />\non the outside, out to the<br />\nUltimate demon in the throne of hell, the devil<br />\nlinnself\u2014Stalin, the perpetual and absolute writer of<br />\nFate.<br />\nBut if the content alone had been expanded, the<br />\nnovel would have been a bore of suffering, repeating the<br />\nindieu of pain past the point of making a point. In The<br />\nFt.rst Circle, Solzhenitsyn has performed the small<br />\nmiracle of expanding not the reader's pain, but his ethos,<br />\ncjiluting the strength of the pain, by making the agony of<br />\niLvan Denisovich's day into an encyclopedia of subtle<br />\nlia, a four-day, 360 degree tour of the sharashka, the<br />\n'tell of softened flames.<br />\nThe sharashka is a center for special prisoners,<br />\nWhose characters, lives and relations have been<br />\nLondemned<br />\nby the state, but whose intellects are vital to<br />\nthe state's paranoid security needs. Damned but needed,<br />\noutcast but not forgotten, the 281 zeks of the Mavrino<br />\ns_harashka weave tiny and intricate patterns in their<br />\niractured lives<br />\nand in the lives of their captors and loved<br />\nones. The patterns float into actions, the actions into the<br />\ncircles.<br />\nInnokenty Volodin, States Counselor in the<br />\nMinistry of Foreign Affairs, phones a warning to a friend<br />\nabout to be arrested. Camp zeks arrive at Mavrino and<br />\nare introduced to the new layer of hell. The sharashka<br />\nzeks work on a tap-proof telephone for which their<br />\nsuPeriors are responsible to superiors to a chain of<br />\n1\u00b01111mand that ends at the pit of ultimate darkness. The<br />\nnlackness of the novel is here overwhelming, the nexus is<br />\n,exPosed, is exposed: the heart of the brain from which<br />\nihe circles emanate like ripples on a frozen pond. The<br />\nFlovvman. The Old Redeemer. The New Tsar.<br />\nThere follows a slow retreat from the nexus. The<br />\nzek Nerzhin sees his wife for the first time in a year. The<br />\nek. Rubin is assigned to a new project, the detection of<br />\ntvoices by an electronic voiceprint system, December 24<br />\ntough December 27, 1949. Four days in the lives.<br />\n0_,iories are told and remembered. The characters are<br />\nto a golden frustration. The free man, Innokenty<br />\n710din is arrested, receives his citizen training in the<br />\n/lxidst internal state of prison Russia, is a zek. Zeks,<br />\n'N,erzhin among them, are given an hour's notice, then<br />\nPd.eked into a prison wagon whose sides are decorated<br />\nwail the names of foodstuffs. A foreign journalist notes,<br />\nPassing the truck in downtown Moscow:<br />\nc. \"On the streets of Moscow one often sees vans<br />\n'flied with foodstuffs, very neat and hygenically<br />\nhnpeccable. One can only conclude that the provisioning<br />\nn,ls the capital is excellent.\"\u2014the zeks are leaving the<br />\nsnarashka for the labor camps.<br />\nRussia's immensity of geographic freedom<br />\nu\u2018einands the inescapable servitude that has become the<br />\n(-tux of the national character, just as Russia's natural<br />\nabundance engrained starvation on the faces of the<br />\nPopulation. The potentiality of happiness inevitably<br />\n,uegets tragedy\u2014the essence and being of Russian art, the<br />\nlather of the inherent irony. The First Circle as an<br />\n,enThodiment of this theme becomes another step in a<br />\n_lterary tradition at least as old as Pushkin and<br />\nrniontov. It has been a tradition which has explored<br />\ncircumference of man's enslavement to his freedom,<br />\n!us hatred for his love, the guilt upon which is based his<br />\nIn nocence. The ironic content is expressed in the<br />\nne.therworld style of subtle contradictions: the men can<br />\nthink but they are not free, can live comfortably but<br />\nieannot extract satisfaction from that comfort, can create<br />\nnut can only create for their captors... The list is as long<br />\nas Solzhenitsyn's book.<br />\nThe world of The First Circle, then, is a world of<br />\nelements that can interact with each other to a limited<br />\nextent but whose every interaction fits into a greater, all<br />\nencompassing pattern governed by the irony of the<br />\nOOOOOOO<br />\n<br />\n\"Sexy Sighing ?\"<br />\nI Gasped Hotly<br />\n(Continued from Page 12)<br />\n<br />\nPlease allow me to introduce myself<br />\nI'm a man of wealth and taste<br />\nI was around when Jesus Christ<br />\nhad his moment of doubt and pain<br />\nmade damn sure that Pilate<br />\nwashed his hands and sealed his fate.<br />\n<br />\nALEXSANDR 1. SOLZHENITSYN<br />\n<br />\nconcentric circles of setting: the lab, the sharashka, the<br />\nprison system, the Soviet government, the naked law of<br />\nironic contradiction. Solzhenitsyn's Stalin-Lucifer figure<br />\nis a slip-jacket for the meaning of the book. He is closest<br />\nto the reader, because he is a tangible figure, a bridge<br />\nbetween newspaper reality and literature. At the same<br />\ntime, he is the deepest of the book's abstractions<br />\nembodying the essence of the iron law of ironic<br />\ncontradiction. Solzhenitsyn has renounced the literary<br />\nprivilege/necessity that his characters must be<br />\nunconfirmable (i.e., of so small a stature as to be<br />\nuntraceable or unrecognizable in the \"real\" world of the<br />\nreader and his book), but in so doing has hurled a<br />\nchallenge at the engrained obstacles between the reader<br />\nand the abstraction (documented by fiction) that is not<br />\nin itself fictional.<br />\n\"So Dante thought up a special place for them in<br />\nHell\" This, then, is the reader's first circle, a level of<br />\nHell even more subtle than the sharashka. For the reader<br />\nhimself is drawn into the evil by the Stalin device and<br />\nyet is still a prisoner of the reality of the book. The<br />\nreader's first circle comes into being with his departure<br />\nfrom the objective scrutiny of \"fiction\" and his entry<br />\ninto a document that is, all the same, a piece of<br />\npaper\u2014the reader is free because of the weakness of the<br />\npulp prison, yet still a prisoner to its meaning\u2014the ironic<br />\ncontent of the netherworld of subtle contradiction.<br />\nPerhaps this is the nature of all fiction. It is<br />\nachieved in The First Circle.<br />\n<br />\nPleased to meet you<br />\nhope you guess my name<br />\nbut why puzzlin' you<br />\nwith the nature of my game.<br />\nYou realize soon that Jagger is charting the Devil's<br />\ntouch throughout the centuries. We are given a tour<br />\nthrough the Russian revolution, the blitzkrieg, the<br />\nKennedy assassinations, and other historical events. At<br />\nthe same time the Stones have taken up a cooing,<br />\nrepetitive harmony and the song accelerates in tempo<br />\nand intensity. At the end of this diabolical song, the<br />\nDevil threateningly introduces himself. There is an<br />\norgasmic fade out (the Stones are fadeout masters) with<br />\nJagger wailing in a high pitched voice, \"Tell me, baby,<br />\nwhat's my name?\" and cooing like a fiend. There is not a<br />\nconcert hall in the world Lhat wouldn't be burnt to the<br />\nground ten minutes after a performance of this song.<br />\nBlack Like White<br />\nAnother outstanding song is a country blues,<br />\nProdigal Son. It is the best country blues(a purely black<br />\nart form) by a white man I have ever heard. John<br />\nHammond, John Mayall, and \"Spider\" John Koerner,<br />\namong others, have tried to preserve and imitate the<br />\ncountry blues sound of greats like Robert Johnson,<br />\nSleepy John Estes, and Son House, but none of them has<br />\ndone it with the skill of Mick Jagger. Prodigal Son is a<br />\ndead ringer for a field recording of the 1930's. Jagger<br />\nmust have a blues record collection . bigger than the<br />\n'Library of Congress to be able to do country blues so<br />\nwell.<br />\nIn any case, the album has other equally excellent<br />\nsongs. \"Factory Girl,\" the Dylanesque \"Jig-Saw Puzzle,\"<br />\nand \"Salt of the Earth\" are all well done, melodically<br />\nand lyrically. Jagger shouldn't have to mumble his words<br />\nso much\u2014they are very much worth hearing. It is<br />\nwithout a doubt the best album the Stones have ever<br />\ndone, and one of the best of the year.

The individualists stare into each<br />\nother's eyes and yet deny the existence of each other.\"<br />\n--Ingmar Bergman, Introduction to Four<br />\nScreenplays ofIngmar Bergman<br />\nThe movie opens at dawn in the bedroom of Jan<br />\nand Eva Rosenberg. They sleep in separate beds. The<br />\nalarm rings and Eve awakens, turns off the alarm, throws<br />\nopen the curtains and light comes streaming into the<br />\nroom. As she walks from the window (we see her<br />\nreflection in the mirrow at the foot of Jan's bed) to go<br />\nabout her morning ablutions Jan gets up, puts on his<br />\nglasses and slippers, and sits looking out the window. He<br />\ntells Eva, who is in front of the wash basin, mirrow<br />\nabove, of a dream he had. They were back in the<br />\norchestra, before all the trouble between them. Eva ,<br />\nmerely remarks that he has stopped shaving.<br />\nImplicit in this scene are most of the devices,<br />\nthematic and cinematic, which Bergman uses to build<br />\nShame. Most important are windows, for shame is a<br />\nmatter of being seen. Bergman constantly makes shots<br />\nthrough windows, often done so that one can see<br />\nreflections in the window as well as being able to see<br />\nthrough the window\u2014as though Bergman were saying<br />\nthat that which allows us to see into the world also<br />\ncondemns us to seeing our own reflection, that which<br />\nconnects us to others also separates us from them. The<br />\nsunlight streaming through the window will reappear in<br />\nthe literally blinding flashes of light in the bombardment<br />\nscenes where one is obliged to blink and squint in order<br />\nto shut out the light; thereby the viewer becomes<br />\nacutely aware of his eyes\u2014just as Bergman's camera<br />\nfollows Eva's, Jan's and Jacobi's eyes. Shame is through<br />\nthe eyes.<br />\nThat something is wrong between Jan and Eva is<br />\nthe precondition of the film and not the conclusion;<br />\nBergman is not stating an argument where he gives<br />\npremises and reasons to an inescapable<br />\nconclusion\u2014rather he merely states what is. There is<br />\nsomething wrong. When he tells his dream (looking<br />\nthrough the window) Jan is addressing himself and the<br />\nworld as much as he is addressing Eva. And she isn't<br />\nlistening; she merely notes that he hasn't shaved. They<br />\nlive in two worlds which just happen (chance,<br />\ncontingency) to coincide\u2014at points.<br />\nFrom this simple beginning Bergman constructs a<br />\nfilm\u2014in much the way Bach constructs a complicated.<br />\ncontrapuntal piece from a simple idea. Ostensibly we<br />\nwatch the degradation wrought on Jan and Eva through'<br />\ntheir efforts to escape a Wdj which is meaningless to<br />\nthem and which they don't give a damn about. But they<br />\ncannot escape? things are always one step ahead of<br />\n<br />\nthem\u2014the bridge is blocked by the wreckage of a tank<br />\nwhen they get there. They end up in a small boat in the<br />\nsea. Just floating.<br />\nShame \u2022<br />\nBut Shame is no impotent existential cry of<br />\nanguish at the hopelessness of the human condition;<br />\nrather, Bergman penetrates into the very center of that<br />\nexistential cry\u2014and the only diagnostic clue is the<br />\nubiquitous windows which reflect sight as well as,<br />\ntransmit sight. The real course of the film is from the<br />\nsurface of a human condition to the very core of that<br />\ncondition. We start with the Rosenbergs. To be sure,<br />\nthey quarrel, they speak more at each other than to each<br />\nother. But their marriage is no worse than most. Still,<br />\nthey are childless and this bothers Eva;it doesn't bother<br />\nJan. As the narrative moves forward into the war,<br />\nBergman penetrates inward beneath the merely flawed<br />\nsurface of the Rosenbergs' marriage to the real war<br />\nbeneath. The deeper the Rosenbergs are sucked into the<br />\nevents of the war around them the more their own<br />\nrelationship deteriorates. To be more exact, Bergman<br />\nuses the external war, quite meaningless to the viewer<br />\nwho has no idea who the good and bad guys are as a<br />\ndevice to pare away the outer layers of the Rosenbergs<br />\nand get down to the agonizingly empty core. Just as we<br />\nmust take the war as given so we must take the final<br />\naimless floating at sea as given, as the human individual<br />\ninterior of which the war is the social exterior. The film<br />\nmoves from outside to inside rather than from beginning<br />\nto end.<br />\nShame is that the exterior always betrays the<br />\ninterior, the interior which tries to keep itself contained<br />\nentirely within its own interiority\u2014in the way a young<br />\nchild will close his eyes so that no one else can see him.<br />\nA group of paratroopers forces Jan and Eva to give a TV<br />\ninterview and Jan's' heart skips a beat (he does have a<br />\nweak heart) and he faints. They are later accused of<br />\ncollaboration with the enemy and the interview is shown<br />\nas evidence. Eva's voice has been erased and another<br />\nvoice dubbled in saying that they have longed for<br />\nliberation and they welcome their liberators. Jan and<br />\nEva plead that the interview was a forgery\u2014as it was. Or<br />\nwas it: When the interview was filmed the paratrooper's<br />\ncamera was pointing towards us; we saw the side of Eva<br />\naway from the camera. When the film was shown during<br />\ninterrogation we saw the same side seen by the enemy<br />\ncamera. And we heard a different voice saying something<br />\ndifferent. But Eva, and Jan as well, really do long for<br />\nliberation; the dubbed in voice spoke the truth which<br />\nwas on the other side of Eva's evasion, just as the<br />\ninterviewer's camera was on the other side from<br />\nBergman's camera. Thus Bergman betrays to us Jan and<br />\nEva's desire to be liberated from meaninglessness; a<br />\ndesire they never formulate to themselves. And just as<br />\nBergman betrays them to us, so they betray themselves<br />\nto each other. As their friend, Jacobi, the mayor, says,<br />\nthere is \"no-where to hide, no evasions, no excuses, only<br />\na great guilt.\"<br />\nSham<br />\nJan and Eva don't want each other; they only<br />\nwant their own autonomy. They don't want the war<br />\neither. But it is there and it forces than to need each<br />\n<br />\nother. Their shame lies in the fact that they are forced to<br />\nneed what they don't want\u2014each other. The war exposes,<br />\nthem to each other by disrupting their everyday lives<br />\nuntil at the end they don't speak to each other. They<br />\nmerely exist touching each other in the boat. Floating.<br />\nAnd through the device of meaningless, denial of<br />\ncontext, Bergman exposes us to ourselves. The war is so<br />\ncontextless that we can only except it as a brute<br />\nfact\u2014and as a metaphor for a human condition. The final<br />\nscene is just floating. By that time we have gone far<br />\nbeyond the question of whether or not the boat Will<br />\nreach the mainland\u2014for the Rosenbergs' have made an<br />\nisland the scene of their subjective insularity. There is<br />\nneither beginning nor end to floating\u2014only the<br />\ncontingency of being. Why not suicide? Because Jan and<br />\nEva are just floating; they only go where they have been<br />\npushed. Suicide is an act of the will.<br />\nShame<br />\nBut Filip, the boatman, does slip over the<br />\n1<br />\nside-quietly, to death. Why? The answer is shame. Filip<br />\nappeared<br />\nfirst<br />\nhe<br />\nanything;<br />\nis the only one who does<br />\na<br />\nearly in the picture as a friend from whom Jan and Eva<br />\nthe<br />\nof<br />\nnews<br />\nfirst<br />\ntheir<br />\nthem<br />\nbought fish\u2014he gave<br />\ninvasion. He later appeared as the head of some people's<br />\n(peasants') organization which was on one side or other,<br />\nin the war, or perhaps on its own side. He was<br />\nresponsible for the death of Jacobi, who was<br />\nEstablishment flunky - in the area. But he first gave<br />\nJacobi the chance of buying himself off as the<br />\norganization need money. Jacobi had just made a whore<br />\nof Eva, or perhaps merely given her the opportunity of<br />\nmaking a whore of herself, and he asked for a loan. Eva<br />\ndidn't have the money, Jan did. And Jan wasn't going to<br />\nwife's<br />\ngive it up; he wasn't going to surrender his<br />\nJacobi<br />\nSo<br />\nhim.<br />\ncuckholded<br />\nhad<br />\nearnings to the man who<br />\nwas executed\u2014Filip made Jan pull the trigger.<br />\nInstead, Jan uses his wife's whore money to buy<br />\npassage on Filip's boat. And you can tell by the WY<br />\nFilip looks at Jan by the sea and the way he fingers the<br />\nmoney that he knows where this money came from, that<br />\nthis is the money for which Jacobi was executed. FiliP<br />\nchooses a moment when he thinks no one is watching,<br />\nhe doesn't want to be seen, exposed, shamed, and slips<br />\nover the side; for his acceptance of the money from Jan<br />\nexposed the sordid roots of his activities\u2014ostensibly<br />\nhelping people to escape to the mainland (Jacobi had<br />\nearlier referred to him and his men as \"terrible<br />\nidealists\"). He was no idealist; his acceptance of Jan and<br />\nhad<br />\nEva's shame money exposed him to Jan and Eva. He<br />\ndishonor.<br />\nhis<br />\nto<br />\ncover<br />\nthe<br />\nside<br />\nno choice but to slip over<br />\nBut he was deceived when he thought Jan was (<br />\nasleep. Jan saw him slip oyer the side. Even in his<br />\nattempt to escape from the dishonor of his exposure<br />\nFilip was exposed.<br />\nAnd so Filip, captain of the ship, is no more: And<br />\nnothing is changed. Jan, Eva, the other passengers are<br />\njust there in the boat. Huddled close together.

We heard he had blinding speed,<br />\ninstant acceleration, the quickness of a cat, Herculean strength, a<br />\nfierce will to win, and enough moves to force Jimmy On and Jimmy<br />\nLewis to retire simultaneously. His name was Joe Cowan. Being<br />\ncynical and somewhat sophisticated, I, for one, discounted those<br />\nbrash rumors. Pfui.<br />\nOf course, since then, Joe Cowan has been All-American in<br />\nboth lacrosse and football for two consecutive years(not to mention<br />\nthe leagues most valuable football player. and the nation's best<br />\nattackman). However, a lot of Hoppies may have missed his latest<br />\nand perhaps most significant accomplishment: he was drafted<br />\nby the<br />\nBaltimore Colts. Believe it or not, Upton Bell and Don Shula picked<br />\nJoe Cowan to play with that same Jimmy Orr, not to mention the<br />\nlikes of John Mackey, Ray Perkins, Alex Hawkins, Ed Hinton<br />\nand<br />\nDavid Lee with whom he will have to compete.<br />\nJohns Hopkins may have more players in the Lacrosse Hall of<br />\name than all the other colleges put together, but Joe Cowan is the<br />\nlust of its gridiron heroes to even be drafted.<br />\nUpton Bell, the Director of Player Personnel and one of the<br />\n,moving forces behind the Colt draft picks, has described Cowan as a<br />\n\"stronger Jimmy Orr.\" Mr. Bell, when asked why the Colts went<br />\nwith \"Super Joe\" (II), replied that Joe was just such an all around<br />\nfantastic athlete that the Colts couldn't pass him by (indeed, his<br />\nexact words were \"One hell of an athlete\"). He could catch, run,<br />\ntackle, and<br />\nkick and there wasn't too much else left for a football<br />\nPlayer to do.<br />\nJoe's lack of specialization and his underdeveloped abilities<br />\nseem to<br />\nbe his major assets. Coach Alex Sotir, Super Joe's gridiron<br />\nmentor for two years, believes that if Cowan does stick with the<br />\nteam, it<br />\nwill be as a punter. This is because David Lee the Colt<br />\nPunter, does nothing but punt, and, for the last two years, hasn't<br />\nexactly excelled at even that.<br />\nThe Colts know that Joe has never<br />\nteallY worked at his punting and feel that with the proper attention,<br />\nCould<br />\nimprove significantly.<br />\nBut neither Joe Cowan, nor Alex Sotir will downgrade the<br />\ntremendous challenge awaiting Joe. He cannot expect to brake in as<br />\na flanker for several years on a team with one of<br />\nthe best passing<br />\nattacks in pro-football. Rather, he will need to shine immediately<br />\nand consistently as a man who can do a little of everything - who can<br />\nPunt as well as David Lee, who can run the ball when necessary, who<br />\nmake tackles on specialty teams, and even return the ball<br />\nnirnself. But most of all, Joe Cowan will have to be a hungry ball<br />\nPelayer.<br />\nThere will be players who have nothing fall back on if the<br />\ntiolts release them, players who have known<br />\nnothing but football<br />\nuteir whole lives. Joe's reaction can only be described as excitement<br />\nc\u00b011Pled with determination. He knows that the odds have been<br />\nstacked against him even as they have been for the last two years<br />\nwhen he has met defenses designed exclusively to stop him.<br />\n,<br />\n14<br />\nOne advantage he might have is the very fact that he is from<br />\n\"<br />\n,ai<br />\n4-more. The Colts have garnered some criticism for never drafting<br />\nrine twon boys and perhaps this will in some way influence their<br />\nZeision. At any rate, Joe has the examples of Preston Pearson,<br />\n_Ltafted when still a basketball player, and Gene Alley, another 17th<br />\n0,11nd draft choice who Mr. Bell expects to make the<br />\nteam this year.<br />\nmight be worthwhile to note that Alley was kept on for more than<br />\nre year and is only now blossoming. So don't be surprised if a<br />\niple of years from now there really is another Super Joe, only in<br />\nnaltnnore instead of New York.<br />\n<br />\nF<br />\n<br />\n1<br />\n<br />\nPAGE 17<br />\n<br />\nGrapplers Encounter Garnets<br />\nAfter Devastating C.U.

Their 8-2 record will<br />\nbe put on the line tomorrow<br />\nagainst Franklin & Marshall in<br />\nLancaster, Pa. in the final dual<br />\nmeet of the season.<br />\nUnder first-year coach<br />\nFrank Comfort, Hopkins has at<br />\nlast achieved a small degree of<br />\nswimming prominence, at least<br />\nin Mason-Dixon and Middle<br />\nAtlantic Conference circles.<br />\nTriumphs over a strong Delaware<br />\ncrew, defending MAC champs<br />\nDickinson, and Penn State<br />\nhighlighted the season. Other<br />\nvictories came against Towson<br />\nState, PMC, Swarthmore,<br />\nHaverford, and Georgetown. The<br />\ntwo losses came at the hands of<br />\nDrexel and Loyola both by<br />\n51-44 scores, decided by the<br />\nfinal relay.<br />\nIn looking back over the<br />\nseason, one has to be pleased<br />\nwith the progress of the team.<br />\nOnly against Loyola did the<br />\nteam look flat. Yet it would be<br />\nfolly to hide the fact that the<br />\nJays have weaknesses along with<br />\ntheir numerous strengths. A look<br />\nat some statistics will indicate<br />\nboth.<br />\nIn previous years, Hopkins<br />\nwas effective only in butterfly<br />\n<br />\nand diving. Freestyle and<br />\nbackstroke were only adequate<br />\nand breaststroke was<br />\nhorrendous. This year, while all<br />\nevents have grown immeasurably<br />\nstronger, the Jays have grown<br />\ninto primarily a \"stroke\" team,<br />\ntheir strongest events being the<br />\nmedley relay, fly, back, and<br />\nbreaststroke. Distance freestyle<br />\nsprints and free relay where lack<br />\nof depth hurts. This lineup does,<br />\nhowever give Hopkins a decided<br />\nedge in Mason-Dixon<br />\ncompetition which adds both<br />\nthe 1000 yd. freestyle and three<br />\nmeter diving to the regular<br />\nlineup.

Although some professors<br />\nfavored using students from Goucher while another<br />\nproposed that the University simply open admissions to<br />\nall qualified students, most were clearly bored by the<br />\nissue. There was also a question as to how many female<br />\nstudents should be admitted on the undergraduate level<br />\nregardless of how they were recruited.<br />\nHealth Sciences<br />\nDirectly related to the co-education question was<br />\nDr. Gordon's proposal that a School of Allied Health<br />\nSciences be established at the University. A committee<br />\nhas been studying this idea since 1967 and has<br />\nrecommended several alternative programs in this area.<br />\nOne /plan calls for Hopkins to train 125 nurses and<br />\nmedical tetqhnicians a year at a special school that would<br />\nbe built in East Baltimore. Hopkins professors would<br />\ntravel from Homewood to teach at the new school.<br />\nA second plan would require the University to<br />\naccept 125 nurses and technicians a year who would<br />\nspend their first two years studying at Homewood and<br />\ntheir last two years working at the medical center. They<br />\nwould follow a special program which would include<br />\nboth liberal arts and sciences.

The topics of these reports were in the areas of<br />\neducation, health, social problems and physical<br />\nenvironment.<br />\nBesides these guides to services, the organization is<br />\nnow beginning its second phase;in Jone's words, to \"see<br />\nhow the people are adjusting to the present programs.\"<br />\nHe believes this survey can begin after another Federal<br />\ngrant is assured in April.<br />\nOn a practical level, HECUA has taken steps<br />\ntowards reforming its own ivory tower to present needs.<br />\nSays Jones, \"there is recognition that we can no longer<br />\nfollow the procedures of regular admissions as in the<br /><br />\npast. They must be more flexible for the disadvantaged<br />\nstudent and must take his background into account.\"<br />\nBesides this recognition, HECUA is also instructing the<br />\nguidance counselors of the Inner City of college<br />\nrequirements. Most of the counselors are massively<br />\noverburdened with up to 200 students under their<br />\nguiding umbrella which many times results in \"poor<br />\ndirection,\" stated the President of HECUA.<br />\nPsychological?<br />\nMr. Jones believes his program, although short on<br />\nconcrete accomplishments, has resulted in a number of<br />\npsychological benefits. \"We aren't planning to change<br />\nconditions overnight. Part of our job is to keep the issues<br />\nbefores the proper people,\" he said. \"But we are<br />\nstimulating individual institutions to do more work (in<br />\nthe ghettos) by themselves.\" Furthermore, Jones sees<br />\nHECUA as an avenue to \"coordinate activities and<br />\nexchange information between universities and the city.<br />\nIn fact this has been the first time Maryland universities<br />\nhave gotten together on anything,\" he pointed out.<br /><br />\n\u2014\"counseling for high school students is inadequate<br />\nboth in quality and in quantity,\"<br />\n\u2014\"colleges and universities must change their traditional<br />\nposture as defender of the status quo.\"<br />\nThe Hopkins Vice-President expressed \"pleasure<br />\nover the first few years on the development of the<br />\nHopkins Urban Center and the development of new<br />\ncourses in other colleges urban problems.\", He believes<br />\nthe posture of many of thes colleges surrounding<br />\nBaltimore are changing to the demands of urban areas.<br />\nFor Hopkins at least, he hopes that we can bring our<br />\nprograms and people to the Inner City.\"<br /><br />\n\"Wages Too Low\"<br />\nIn a recent white paper, entitled the Urban<br />\nColleges and the Urban Crisis, HECUA sought to outline<br />\nthe \"ideas voiced by residents of disadvantaged<br />\nneighborhoods concerning the need for commitment by<br />\nthe higher education to solving urban problems.\" The<br />\nProgram was sponsored at Coppin State College by<br />\nHECUA, and involved about 75-80 slum-dwellers, Jones<br />\nestimated.<br />\nIncluded in some of the recommendations were:<br />\n\u2014\"wages paid to service personnel (at the colleges) are<br />\ntoo low\" and \"there is a continued unspoken segregation<br />\nin facilities and administrations.\"<br />\n--\"There should be more student internships and<br />\non-the-job training\" and \"student tutorials should<br />\ninvolve children more in the life of the college, through<br />\nparticipation in on-campus activities,\"<br /><br />\nIHU Faculty,<br />\nGrad Students,<br />\nForm Caucus<br />\nA group of radical faculty and<br />\ngraduate students formed a Hopkins<br />\nChapter of the New University<br />\nConference last week.

This would formalize the BSU as an<br />\nofficial extracurricular activity, and entitle it to<br />\nsome advantages.<br />\nThis constitution was not ratified by the Council,<br />\nas a majority of its members felt that the membership<br />\nclause was discriminatory. The phrase in question read,<br />\n\"the membership of the Black Students Organization<br />\nshall be open to all black members of the Johns Hopkins<br />\nstudent body.\" This was felt necessary by the BSU to<br />\naid in its recruitment of blacks for Hopkins. The Council<br />\nvote was not taken as a setback by the BSU, however, as<br />\nits president, Bruce Baker, declared that they would<br />\n\"completely ignore the Student Council's decision.\"<br />\nDiscrimination Amendment<br />\nIn the wake of the BSU controversy sophomore<br />\nDean Rudoy introduced an amendment to the SC<br />\nconstitution which would prohibit the qpproval of any<br />\ngroup's character which restricted membership on the<br />\nbasis of race, creed, religion, or national origin. This<br />\namendment was passed by a vote of 13-0-0 on November<br />\n11, and was to be submitted within two weeks to the<br />\nstudent body in a referendum for final approval. It has<br />\nnot been.<br />\nReasons for this inaction were advanced by<br />\nCouncil president Russ Passarella, who said that the SC<br />\nwas too busy between Thanksgiving and Christmas with<br />\nthe Eisenhower Symposium, and that from Christmas to<br />\nthe end of the semester \"everyone was throating for<br />\nexams and we didn't think we could get the necessary<br />\nresponse.\" Passarella failed to mention the two-week<br />\nperiod between November 11 and Thanksgiving.<br />\nAt present the status of the discrimination<br />\namendment is pending the recommendations of a<br />\ncommittee, headed by Manuel Rodriguez, which is<br />\nconducting an extensive review of the SC constitution.<br />\nWhens that committee makes its report, then the<br />\nreferendum will be held.<br />\nNew Committees<br />\nDuring the semester the Council has also been<br />\ninvolved in improving relationships between students,<br />\nfaculty, and administration. On October 7 the creation<br />\nof the Undergraduate AdmiSsions Council was approved.<br />\nThis body will aid the Admissions office in attracting<br />\ntop-flight students to Hopkins, especially black ones,<br />\nwhile trying to dispel the Hopkins image as a pre-med<br />\nfactory.<br />\nOther groups were formed with the intention of<br />\n. ing student participation in University<br />\nlent. The Committee on .Undergraduate Studies<br />\n\u2018k.<br />\n.,tituted as a subcommittee to the Academic<br />\nCouncil. Also created were the Committees on Student<br />\nRelations and Student Affairs.<br />\nThis area of endeavor remained a disappointment<br />\nto some Council members. The Academic Council, the<br />\nUniversity's top policy making board, rejected a<br />\nproposal to allow two student representatives to attend<br />\nits meetings. However, according to Passarella, \"the<br />\nbiggest problem is communication between the students<br />\nand the Council, not between the Council and the<br />\nadministration.\"<br /><br />\nGARY NOTHSTEIN, president of the SAC, helps<br />\ndecide on funds for student groups.<br /><br />\nCreated in early November, the Speakers Bureau<br />\nhad the purpose of promoting more dialogue between<br />\nHoppies and the Baltimore community by making<br />\nstudent speakers available to local civic and social<br />\ngroups. Its first engagement will be at the end of this<br />\nmonth, before a businessmen's club.<br />\nPolitics and the presidential election also<br />\ninterested the Student Council during the previous<br />\nsemester. A resolution was adopted on October 28 to<br />\nsupport the SDS teach-in, held on Nov. 4, and the<br />\nWashington demonstrations, held on Nov. 5, election<br />\nday. The activities were \"a legitimate sign of protest in a<br />\ndemocratic society against the present vacuum of<br />\nleadership and the lack of popular democratic control in<br />\nthis society,\" the resolution said.<br />\nWilling to back up the words of the resolution<br />\nwith cash, the Council voted to refund bail money to<br />\nthose Hoppies arrested in the Washington<br />\ndemonstrations. Funds were approved for those charged<br />\nwith \"demonstrating without a permit.\"<br />\nSergio Loses Pesos<br />\nQuestions have been raised about the quality of<br />\nmusical groups brought to Homewood. The Student<br />\nCouncil has sponsored the Serendipity Singers, Charlie<br />\nByrd, Sergio Mendes and Brasil '66, and Tim Hardin.<br />\nCount Basic and the Vanilla Fudge will appear this<br />\nspring. The Sergio Mendes concert was budgeted for a<br />\nloss, and proved to live up to its fiscal expectations.<br />\nEx-council member, Greg Mertz revealed that Big<br />\nBrother and the Holding Company and Traffic could<br />\nhave been obtained for a joint concert in place of Sergio<br />\nMendes, and for a less expensive fee. According to him<br />\nPassarella's inaction was the cause of this opportunity<br />\nbeing missed. He also said that the Jefferson Airplane<br />\nand the Cream could have replaced the Mothers of<br />\nInvention and the Lovin' Spoonful as last year's<br />\nperformers.<br />\nOn many occasions Mertz has suggested to<br />\nPassarella the possibility of establishing groups of<br />\nstudents interested in one particular field of music, who<br />\nwould then concur as to what the best attraction in that<br />\nfield would be. He was always turned down, as Passarella<br />\nclaimed that these committees would become closed<br />\nspecial interest groups.<br />\nEisenhower Symposium<br />\nDuring the first two weeks of December the<br />\nStudent Council presented the Eisenhower Symposium<br /><br />\nMR. BILGRA'VE also has a major voice in deciding where<br />\nstudent money should go.<br /><br />\non the topic of revolution in Latin America. Features<br />\namong the many speakers were Dr. Lincoln Gordon, Dr.<br />\nMilton S.

The constitution of the new<br />\ncampus newspaper, The Odyssey, was approved at the<br />\nJanuary 13 meeting, after the regular rules had been<br />\nwaived. This was done so that the first issue could<br />\nappear in early February. A new constitution was<br />\nwritten for the Hullabaloo, limiting the amount of<br />\nmoney it can spend. This was done because of general<br />\ndissatisfaction with last year's yearbook.<br /><br />\nI Three-Man Committee Controls Fundsi<br />\nThe dispersal of student and university<br />\nfunds to the various student organizations is<br />\nhandled by a committee of two students and<br />\none administrator, from which there is no higher<br />\nbody of appeal.<br /><br />\nThe sixty-three thousand dollars available for use<br />\nby recognized student organizations is apportioned<br />\nannually by an Executive Committee composed of the<br />\nDirector of Student Affairs, Robert Bilgrave, the<br />\nChairman of the Student Activities Commission (SAC)<br />\nGary Nothstein, and the President of the Student<br />\nCouncil, Russell Passarella.<br />\nStudent Council recognition of the organization<br />\ndetermines its eligibility for SAC funds. Thus, the<br />\nconstitution of a new student organization must be<br />\nsubmitted to the Council for approv 1; and, barring<br />\ndiscrimination or the political character of the<br />\norganization, Council approval usually leads to funding.<br />\nIn the late spring, organizational budget requests<br />\nare submitted to the Executive Committee, which,<br />\naccording to Bilgrave, passes on the requests in \"a fair<br />\nand equitable way.\" In defending the composition of the<br />\nCommittee, Bilgrave noted that, \"To my way of<br />\nthinking, the students who would best represent the<br />\nstudent body would be the President of the Student<br />\nCouncil and the President of the SAC.\"(The SAC is a<br />\nself-perpetuating body, and its chairman is selected by<br />\nthe membership.)<br />\nIn allocating funds, the Committee looks for<br />\nseveral indicators, chiefly thes number of students<br />\ninvolved, whether or not the organization operates<br />\nwithin the confines of university policy, the worth of<br />\nthe organization's objective, and the approval of the<br />\nStudent Council.<br />\nStudent affairs funds come from a $20-per-student<br />\ntax yielding approximately $33,000 annually, and a<br />\nsupplemental university grant of $27,500. The Student<br />\nCouncil is allocated $23,000, which it uses to sponsor<br />\ndances, concerts, and the annual Milton S. Eisenhower<br />\nSymposium.

Swanson,<br />\nDean of undergraduate studies, in a discussion of<br />\nthe student role and voice in the Hopkins<br />\n,Community.<br />\nThere are about ten committees of various sorts on<br />\ncampus which have student \"representatives\"on them.<br />\nThese include the library committee, the bookstore<br /><br />\nRUSS PASSARELLA, president of the SC, argues that the<br />\nCouncil does serve as a active liason.<br /><br />\ncommittee (one meeting during the 68-69 academic<br />\nyear), the committee on the department of Athletics(an<br />\nAd-Hoc committee which has already dissolved),<br />\ncommittee of physical facilities (one two-hour meeting<br />\nduring 68-69), the traffic and parking committee, the<br />\nHomewood Campus Calendar Committee (which Dean<br />\nSwanson described as \"by-passed\"), the committee on<br />\nStudent affairs, the admissions and financial aid<br /><br />\ncommittee, and the committee on undergraduate<br />\nstudies.<br />\nUsually, the students on these committees number<br />\none or two, though on the committee for student affairs<br />\nthere are three student \"representatives.\" In nearly all<br />\ncases these \"representatives\" were appointed by the<br />\nStudent Council more specifically by the officers of the<br />\nCouncil. Russ Passarella, the Student Council president,<br />\n\"<br />\nsaid of the situation, \"Manuel and I do the selecting.<br />\nare<br />\np<br />\nmembershi<br />\ncommittee<br />\nfor<br />\nselected<br />\nThe students<br />\nusually drawn from the Student Council and assigned to<br />\ntheir positions as the president sees fit.<br />\nExceptions<br />\nthis method of selecting who<br />\nto<br />\nexception<br />\nOne<br />\nthe<br />\nwill represent the student body was in the case of<br />\nPaul<br />\nAs<br />\nAthletics.<br />\nof<br />\nt<br />\ndepartmen<br />\nthe<br />\ncommittee on<br />\nAllen, a former committee member, described it: \"I got<br />\ne)<br />\na letter from Mr. Bilgrave (chairman of the committe<br />\nduring the summer, asking me if I wanted to be on the<br />\ncommittee. I didn't know anything about it and I don't<br />\nreally have any idea how I was selected.\" Dennis Estis,<br />\nthe other student on the 7-member committee, was<br />\nappointed by Passarella. The committee recently<br />\nfinished its investigation and has since ceased to exist.<br />\nThe committee on Undergraduate studies, chaired<br />\nby Dean Swanson, has 2 students on its 11 member<br />\nroster. When asked if he thought that these two<br />\nsucceeded in voicing the opinions of the student body,<br />\nSwanson replied, \"I have urged that they truly attempt<br />\nto find out what the students want, but they really<br />\nhaven't yet.\" He felt that this hurt the committee,<br />\nmaking it not as \"effective as it might be.\"<br />\nLarry Campbell, a member of the course guide<br />\nstaff, had early in the year expressed interest in being a<br />\nmember of the committee, or at least being able to take<br />\npart in the discussions, since his position on the Course<br />\n.Guide he felt enabled him to have a rather thorough<br />\nknowledge of student feelings in regards to courses. He<br />\nfound out about the first meeting of the committee,<br />\nwhich he attended, and at which he requested that he be<br />\nallowed to sit on the committee, due to his position on<br />\nthe course guide. He was told to talk to Passarella about<br />\nit, which he subsequently did. Since that first meeting,<br />\nthe committee has met once a month, but Campbell has<br />\nnot been notified of any of the meetings. As he put it, \"I<br />\nwas sorta surprised when I found out about the other<br />\nmeetings.\" Larry Campbell is not a member of the<br />\nStudent Council.<br />\nJay Schoenau and Greg Szoka are members of the<br /><br />\nbookstore committee, both having been appointed by<br />\nPassarella. The twelve-man committee acts in a purely<br />\nadvisory capacity, as evidenced by its unanimous<br />\ndecision to release the financial figures of the bookstore<br />\nto the undergraduate body, in an attempt to make the<br />\nstudents realize the huge amount of money being lost<br />\ndue to thievery. The vote was merely a recommendation,<br />\nhowever;\"I guess the report will have to be passed along<br />\nto some committee somewhere which has some power,\"<br />\nwas Representative Schoenau's explanation.<br />\nThe feeling of most students who act as<br />\nrepresentatives on the various committees is that they<br />\nhave no power, and little voice. Said one member of a<br />\ncommittee, when asked what he or the committee did,<br />\n\"Not a heck of a lot; it's primarily a public relations<br />\njob.\" Each member emphasized that his committee had<br />\nno real decision-making power, but was merely an<br />\nadvisory group.<br />\nMany of the committees have met only once<br />\nduring the academic year, and some of the others only a<br />\nfew more times than that. The committee on physical<br />\nfacilities is one of the committees that had met only<br />\nonce; that meeting was a discussion of a report prepared<br />\nand presented by Ross Jones, Hopkins Vice-President.<br />\nThe Homewood calendar committee, which has student<br />\nrepresentation, had little or no role in the current<br />\ncalendar reforms. Swanson hoped that in the future<br />\nthere would be \"some student input\", but the<br />\ncommittee at the present time had been \"bypassed.\"<br />\nBesides the obvious problem of the students, on<br />\nthe committees having only an advisory capacity, with<br />\nthe committees serving for the most part as places for \"a<br />\ndialogue,\" rather than an exercise of student power,<br />\nthere is the question of whether the student<br />\n\"representatives\" are truly representative of the student<br />\nbody. Said Swanson concerning this, \"In accepting such<br />\na committee post, the student must accept the<br />\nobligation to be responsible to and representative of the<br />\nstudent body.\"<br />\nMost students, however, do not even know of the<br />\nexistence of the committees, much less their<br />\n\"representatives\" on them. Said one student, \"I guess<br />\ncommittee membership looks good on the law school<br />\napplication form, but no body ever asked me what I<br />\n'thought about the physical facilities or the bookstore.\"<br />\nAdded Dean Swanson, \"It's the student 'representative's'<br />\nresponsibility to sound out the students, or even to ask<br />\nfor other students to be brought in to achieve a better<br />\nrepresentation of the student body.\" \"They really<br />\nhaven't done this to date,\" he added sadly.<br /><br />\nCouncil Branded by Dissociation, Stagnation<br />\nBy DAVID HOELSCHER''<br />\nThe Hopkins Student Council,<br />\nlike many councils across the country,<br />\nhas little support from most of the<br />\ncampus activities and little respect from<br />\nthe student body. On the Hopkins<br />\ncampus the dissasociation between the<br />\nCouncil and Hopkins students may be<br />\ntraced to the very conception which<br />\nCouncil members have of their role on<br />\ncampus.<br />\nFundamentally, Russell Passarella,<br />\npresident of the Student Council, stated<br />\nthat the Council today has two<br />\nfunctions. \"The first responsibility is to<br />\nact as a liasion between student<br />\nactivities and the Administration\"<br />\nstated Passarella. In this way the<br />\nCouncil is able to convey information,<br />\npertinent to both the Administration<br />\nand the individual activities.<br />\nThe second role is \"to make<br />\nHopkins a better place.\" Passarella cited<br />\nhis recent activities with the University<br />\nlong-range planning investigations as an<br />\nexample of just such a role. At that<br />\ntime, he attempted to voice a concern<br />\nfor the \"students' point of view,\"<br />\ncalling attention to the lack of<br />\nconsideration for student problems. In<br />\nbringing the student difficulties to the<br />\nattention of the Administration,<br />\nPassarella feels that the Council is able<br />\nto accomplish its goals: to make<br />\nHopkins a better place.<br />\nAccepted Channels<br />\nThe manner in which the Council<br />\nattempts to represent what they see as<br />\nthe student point of view is indicative of<br />\nthe difficulties they face. The president<br />\nof the SC argues that the best way to<br />\ninform the Administration of student<br />\nopinion is not through committee work,<br />\nbut \"by going to the individuals<br /><br />\nthemselves and discussing the problems.<br />\nAny other statement on student affairs<br />\nwould be ignored.\" He further stated<br />\nthat many of the decisions to be made<br />\nrequire a good understanding of both<br />\nthe issues and of previous events.<br />\n\"Often I am the only one who is able to<br />\nmake the final decision,\" stated<br />\nPassarella.<br />\nPassarella, and, in fact, the<br />\nStudent Council, attempts to influence<br />\nthe Administration through \"accepted<br />\nchannels\" and with subtle arguments. It<br />\nis basically the accepted approach of<br />\nAdministrators in most Universities and<br />\nthe way in which they affect change.<br />\nThe Hopkins Student Council,<br />\nhowever, in attempting to \"play the<br />\ngame\" loses all of the benefits of being<br />\nstudent group yet gains none of the<br />\nbenefits of not being one. Obviously the<br />\nAdministrators with whom SC members<br />\ncome into contact are more adept to<br />\ninfluence others and less prone to be<br />\ntalked into actions with which they do<br />\nnot completely agree or with which<br />\nthey are not completely sympathetic.<br />\nAn Ancillary Advising Bureau<br />\nThes \"accomplishments\" of the<br />\nStudent Council--that is, those<br />\naccomplishments falling in the area of<br />\ninnovative actions--are basically<br />\nAdministration accomplishments. The<br />\nrole of the Student Council becomes, it<br />\nappears, purely an ancillary advising<br />\nbureau.<br />\nThe Council, however, is also<br />\nunable to mobilize any widely based<br />\nsupport for itself from the student<br />\nbody. Because the Council attempts to<br />\nwork with the Administration, it is seen<br />\nas less than a dynamic force on campus.<br />\nTherefore, students who want to offer<br />\nnew and different ideas hesitate to<br />\npresent them before the Council.<br /><br />\nFor this reason the Council has<br />\nsubstantial difficulties examining<br />\n\"student opinion.\" Under these adverse<br />\nconditions Passarella tends to depend on<br />\npersonal contacts with fellow students<br />\nas a means of \"sampling\" student<br />\nopinion. It becomes evident what is<br />\nmeant when he states that \"you have to<br />\njust sum up how you perceive reactions<br />\nto issues,\" and how he can state that<br />\n\"people you respect play an important<br />\nrole.\"<br />\nThe Student Council is laboring<br />\nunder a third force which is equally<br />\noppressing: the purely bureaucratic<br />\nfunctions of the Council which leave<br />\nlittle time for creative approaches to old<br />\nproblems.<br />\nBSU Referendum<br />\nThe Black Students Union<br />\nreferendum is one example of such a<br />\nbottleneck. Passarella stated that a<br />\nreferendum on the rejection of the BSU<br />\non account of its discriminatory<br />\npractices was held off because the<br />\nSymposium on Latin American Affairs<br />\n\"took all our time.\" It is evident from<br />\nthis statement, therefore, that all<br />\nactivities of the Council ceased between<br />\nThanksgiving and the Christmas<br />\nvacation because of the program. Such<br />\nan administrative bog can only increase<br />\nthe ineffectiveness of the Council and<br />\nthe difficulties of implimenting change.<br />\nThese three causes of the<br />\nCouncil's ineffectiveness--their<br />\nrelationship with the Administration,<br />\nthe resulting alienation of many<br />\nsegments of the student body and the<br />\nadministrative bottleneck--have<br />\ndrastically effected it's decisions.<br />\nEssentially it appears that those<br />\ndecisions have been made in isolation<br />\nfrom much of the campus.<br />\nWhen a decision must be made<br /><br />\nrequiring consideration of \"campus<br />\nopinion\" or \"campus sentiment\" the<br />\nCouncil labors under great difficulties.<br />\nThis difficulty becomes evident when,<br />\nfor example, choices for concerts are<br />\nexamined.<br />\nBalance of Quality<br />\nPassarella stated that he wants a<br />\n\"balance of quality\" in the concerts<br />\npresented on campus: \"every taste in<br />\nmusic should be represented.\" The<br />\nCouncil has, to some extent, managed<br />\nto do just that and many different<br />\ngroups have been represented at<br />\nHomewood. The quality of that<br />\nrepresentation, however, may be<br />\nquestioned.<br />\nThere is little question about the<br />\nreputation of either Sergio Mendes or<br />\nCount Basic, both groups are among the<br />\nuncontested leaders of their musical<br />\nstyle. The Vanilla Fudge, on the other<br />\nhand, is regarded by most as no more<br />\nthan an average group. There is, at the<br />\nsame time, some evidence that the<br />\nCouncil could have booked groups<br />\nrepresenting the best in the rock and<br />\nhard rock area, much more<br />\neconomically.<br />\nThe failure of the Student Council<br />\nto recognize the mediocrity of the<br />\nFudge is understandable and no<br />\ncomment should or can be made about<br />\nit; their failure to consult people who<br />\nwere aware of such distinction is less<br />\nunderstandable.<br />\nThis seems to be the major<br />\ndifficulty with the Student Council. The<br />\nCouncil is not inept at their job (many<br />\nof the accomplishments of the Council<br />\nthis year have been impressive) but it is<br />\nclear, on the other hand, that it<br />\nfunctions as a specific -interest group<br />\nand shows little overt desire to alter this<br />\nsituation.<br /><br />\nPAGE 8<br /><br />\nNEWS-LETTER<br /><br />\nHOMEWOOD, BALTIMORE, FEB. 21, 1969<br /><br />\nNew Left Analysis<br /><br />\nS Fights NLF for Control Of Southeast Asia<br />\nBy STEPHEN SHRIVER<br /><br />\nAny discussion of the Vietnamese Peace<br />\nNegotiations currently under way in Paris must<br />\nbe seen in the context of the struggle between<br />\nthe United States on the one hand and the<br />\nNational Liberation Front and the Democratic.<br />\nRepublic of Vietnam on the other over the<br />\ncontrol of the destiny of South East Asia.<br />\nThe U.S. is seeking to maintain its control over the<br />\neconomy and resources of the area in order to enable<br />\nlarge-scale corporate investments and the development<br />\nof new .markets crucial for the necessary expansion of<br />\nthe American economy. This means control of the<br />\nnational resources (e.g. 50 million tons of tungsten), the<br />\nguarantee of a low-cost labor force, and a stable political<br />\nclimate conducives to low tax rates, the orderly.<br />\ndevelopment of markets and the containment of any<br />\npolitical resistance to this domination and exploitation.<br />\nThe United States maintains the facade of national<br />\nindependence and self-determination by maintaining in<br />\npower, through total military, economic and political<br />\nsupport, obligarchical military dictatorships.(Kittachorn<br />\nin Thailand, Thieu-Ky in South Vietnam) which are<br />\nbased heavily on the landlord class. In attempting to<br />\nsuppress the Vietnamese revolution, the United States is<br />\ntrying to suppress a major challenge to this system of.<br />\ninternational economic domination, and thereby<br />\nmaintain and enhance its position of world hegemony.<br />\nHowever, given the fact that the U.S. forces and<br />\nthe Saigon Government can only claim, in reality, to<br />\ncontrol the major cities, that, in fact, the \"allies\" have<br />\nsuffered a solid defeat throughout most of the country<br />\nat the hands of the NLF and even in the cities are in an<br />\nincreasingly tenuous position; and given the strong and<br />\ncontinuously rising tide of national and international<br />\nopinion opposing the U.S. policies in Vietnam, the<br />\nAmerican Government is hoping to achieve a working,<br />\nneutral compromise in Paris similar to that worked out<br />\nfor Laos in 1962 in Geneva. Under such a compromise<br />\nthe U.S. would continue to pursue its economic and<br />\npolitical goals in Vietnam under the threat of<br />\nre-intervention to contain \"communist aggression and<br />\nsubversion\". That such re-intervention is likely is evident<br />\nfrom its massive bombing of Laos and continued<br />\nmilitary and CIA support of rightist forces within that<br />\ncountry, as well as from the tremendous investment that<br />\nthe U.S. has expended in creating the huge military<br />\nenclaves along the coast of Vietnam and in Thailand.<br />\nThe NLF, mindful of the repeated violation of the<br />\nGeneva Agreements by the U.S., is fully determined to<br />\nfight until the last American leaves Vietnamese soil.<br />\nThey are fighting a war which has lasted for more than<br />\ntwenty years for their national liberation and<br />\nindependence. They seek to expel foreigns and<br />\nforeign-dominated control of their nation and enable<br />\nthe Vietnamese people to control their own economy<br />\nand politics and thereby to determine their own destiny.<br />\nThey also seek to take power from the Vietnamerse<br />\nruling landlord class and thereby enable the average<br />\npeasant and poor Vietnamese to control his own life and<br />\nthe destiny of the nation. These goals of the Vietnamese<br />\nrevolution are diametrically opposed to the goals of the<br />\nAmerican intervention.<br />\nTherefore, the immediate aims of the U.S. in the<br />\ntalks are the neutralization and sealing of the.<br />\nDemilitarized Zone, the withdrawal of North<br />\nVietnamese troops from the South, and the holding of<br />\nelections for a \"new\" South Vietnamese government. In<br />\nthe first place, this is an attempt to win at the<br />\nconference table what the U.S. has not been able to win<br />\non the battleield.<br />\nSeconds, however, the two aspects of these aims,<br />\nthe military and the political, comprise part of a larger<br />\nstrategy to maintain U.S. control over and safeguard<br />\nU.S. interests and long-range goals in the area. By sealing<br />\nof the DMZ and forcing the withdrawal of DRV troops,<br />\nthe U.S. would hope to seriously hamper the operations<br />\nof the People's Liberation Armed Forces (military arm<br />\nof the NLF). Were these aims achieved, the U.S. figures<br />\nthat its current escalations would be far more effective,<br />\nin terms of guaranteeing a victory for pro-U.S. forces in<br />\nany \"elections\" which may come out of the Paris talks<br />\n(the second U.S. aim in the talks). The U.S. has used<br />\n\"elections\" in the past to legitimize the dictatorships<br />\nthrough which it has maintained its control of South<br />\nVietnam, and would continue to do so in the future as<br />\nthe safest way to accomplish its goals.<br />\nThe current escalations since the bombing halt<br />\nhave been aimed primarily at destroying the NLF<br />\ninfrastructure in the countryside, thereby eliminating<br /><br />\nthe organized opposition to the Saigon regime. Indeed,<br />\nthis has been the U.S.-Saigon strategy ever since the<br />\nascendency of Diem to power.<br />\nThese newest attacks are four-pronged. The first is<br />\n\"Operation Phoenix,\" the aim of which is to assassinate<br />\n80,000 NLF local cadres using special CIA-trained<br />\ncommando units. The second prong is the removal of<br />\nmasses of peasants into government-controlled<br />\nrelocation camps wheres they can be interrogated,<br />\nguarded and claimed as \"friendly\" hamlets. An<br />\noperation last month north of Danang rounded up 2500<br />\npeople, half of the target district's population. The third<br />\nprong of this strategy is a quick-pacification effort which<br />\nis attempting to plant the Saigon flag in as many hamlets<br />\nas possible in as short a time as possible. This is designed<br />\nto recoup the massive losses suffered by the \"allies\" in<br />\nlast year's Tet offensive and thereby give legitimacy to<br />\nthe Saigon regime at Paris. The fourth prong is a<br />\ntremendous increase in the bombing of the<br />\nNLF-controlled areas in the South. Since the bombing<br />\nhalt of the North, the bombing rate has tripled.<br />\nAt the same time, the American public is being<br />\nsounded out for its response to a larger escalation<br />\nplanned for the future in an attempt to win the war<br />\nmilitarily. Charles Mohr of the New York Times wrote<br /><br />\nseveral articles in January citing \"usually reliable sources<br />\n(i.e., the daily '5 o'clock follies' newsbriefings at the<br />\nPentagon East in Saigon, and the CIA) which claimed<br />\nthat the \"allies\" had made excellent gains in the war and<br />\nthat the war could be won if only the public would have<br />\nthe patience to allow the generals to prosecute the war<br />\nfully. The New York Times has traditionally floated<br />\nthese trial ballons for the Pentagon, primarily under the<br />\nby-line of the military affairs expert, Hanson Baldwin.<br />\nSimultaneously, the U.S. is spending much money<br />\nand manpower in an attempt to upgrade the Saigon<br />\nArmy. Such development would permit the U.S. to<br />\nwithdraw some of its troops, claiming de-escalation<br />\nwhile, in effect, the war was escalating.<br />\nThe third aim of the U.S. in the Paris talks is<br />\ndeliberate attempt to distract public opinion to gain<br />\nmaneuvering room for this continued escalation. Seen in<br />\nthe light of the contest between the government and its<br />\nlarge and troublesome opposition at home, Johnson's<br />\nwithdrawal from the presidential race, the bombing halts<br />\nand the start of the talks have been a tremendously<br />\nsuccessfuly publics relations gamble to silence the<br />\noppostiion and defuse the anti-war movement.

Because they have been relatively untouched by<br />\nthe war, many of theses people haves remained<br />\nuncommitted to either side. The NLF is attempting,<br />\ntherefore, to complete its overall, long-term strategy of<br />\nuniting all sects, ethnic groups and classes in a struggle<br />\nagainst the Saigon dictatorship, the landlords and the<br />\naggressing foreign powers for national liberation.<br />\nThe third group which concerns the NLF is the<br />\ninternational public, and especially the U.S. public.<br />\nThrough its forum in Paris, the NLF hopes to strengthen<br />\ninternational public opinion against the War and<br />\nAmerican imperialism. Its prime hope in this area is that<br />\nthe American people will repudiate the policies of \"the<br />\nAmerican ruling class\" and force the withdrawal of the<br />\nUnited States from Vietnam.

Through breakfast<br />\nseminars at Levering Hall, detailed survey of the<br />\nHomewood community and committee reports on local<br />\nfacilities, Mrs. Kline has tried to bring forward some<br />\nplans for action.<br />\nSummer Creatice Crafts<br />\nThe two most striking deficiencies in the<br />\nHomewood area were found to be in education and<br />\nrecreation. HCP-sponsored programs have partially met<br />\nthe two problems. They were initiated when there were<br />\nno other organizations already established to deal with<br />\nthe problem. \"When we discover a pressing need, we will<br />\ntry to solve it to our best ability,\" Mrs. Kline noted. Last<br />\nsummer the project developed a reading and creative<br />\ncrafts program for 85 children in local elementary<br />\nschools. \"We found that many children were far behind<br />\non their reading ability, and the creative arts was an<br />\nincentive for them to come to school during their<br />\nvacation,\" she recalled. The project was staffed mainly<br />\nby volunteer wives anda few Hopkins students with the<br />\nlessons prepared by Helen Goodwin, the director of<br />\nreading at Morgan State College. The in-the-field director<br />\nof the reading program was Hopkins student Paul<br />\nChurchill. \"The program was really successful,\" he said.<br /><br />\nChurchill is no longer a worker for the organization.<br />\nIn the other field, Mrs. Mine said that in the<br />\nRemington area near Homewood they found no<br />\nrecreational facilities or school playgrounds. \"We were<br />\nable to get some space from two churches in the<br />\ncommunity,\" Mrs. Kline stated. Recently, with the help<br />\nof the student-run Community Involvement Board, the<br />\nHCP acted as the \"broker\" in recruiting about 18<br />\nstudent basketball and wrestling instructors for<br />\nRemington from Hopkins. Mrs. Kline also mentioned<br />\ntheir requests to City Hall for better local recreation and<br />\nincreased residential use of the Hopkins' gym.<br />\nUnlike most of the projects run by Levering Hall,<br />\nthe HCP does not deal with Inner City problems. In fact<br />\nMrs. Kline said she was at first \"amazed\" by the dearth<br />\nof student or other programs in the immediate<br />\nenvironment surrounding Hopkins. \"We see no point in<br />\nbeing competitive with the Inner City projects,\" the<br />\nHCP Director emphasized.\"We think that it is important<br />\nto maintain this area\" which she claims is going through<br />\nadjustment pains. \"We want the quality of life<br />\nMaintained and not to go down if the neighborhood goes<br />\nblack,\" she stated.<br />\nIn reply to some critics that say the HCP is a<br />\ncoverup for keeping out blacks, Mrs. Kline heatedly<br />\ndeclared, \"That is absolutely false.

One should also consider the fact that<br />\ncalendar reform, which is only now being seriously considered, has not been dealt with<br />\nin the Student Council for some time.<br /><br />\nKrttrr<br /><br />\n00 Nil11S<br /><br />\nIn its representative function, then, there is conspicuous failure. This fact would<br />\nseem curious in view of the Council's relative competence in rendering services to the<br />\nundergraduate body. However, one is less puzzled if one takes into account the very<br />\nsystem in which the Council operates. Effective action on its responsibility to provide<br />\nservices requires that the Council work in close conjunction and in a spirit of absolute<br />\ncooperation with the administration, which controls the University's funding.<br /><br />\nBRUCE DRAKE,DENNIS ESTIS<br />\nEditors-in-Chief<br />\nJAMES FRANKE., DAVID COOPER<br />\nBusiness Managers<br />\n4.<br /><br />\nSymptoms and Simpletons<br />\nThe Hopkins Student Council, as the campus' only representative undergraduate<br />\nbody, is under two major obligations to its 1700 constituents. Though the activities of<br />\nthe Council are many, they are divisible into the categories of service functions and<br />\nrepresentative functions.<br />\nBy service functions, we mean that the Council is expected to provide for the social<br />\nlife of the Hopkins undergraduate with mixers, concerts and with arrangements for<br />\nbig weekends.\" In addition, under service functions, we would place such activities as<br />\nthe Speakers Bureau, the undergraduate telephone directory, the Student Council<br />\nCalendar and the supervision of various student activities.<br />\nThe Student Association, in its recent decision to devote itself less to providing<br />\nservices and more to off-campus involvement, recognized the Council's responsibility<br />\nfor service functions. In addition, the SA was acknowledging that the Council is<br />\nsuperiorly staffed and equipped to handle these matters. The Council, on the whole,<br />\nhas managed this function \u2022 competently. Though there may be disagreement about<br />\nmany of the decisions which had to be made in fulfilling this obligation to the student<br />\nbody, we submit that there are few (the News-Letter certainly not among them) who<br />\nwould contend that the Council has failed them here.<br />\nHowever, there is another aspect to the Council's functions\u2014those activities which<br />\nare representative. It is in this area that we have frequently taken issue with the<br />\nCouncil and we find that most other criticisms of that body deal with actions in this<br />\nrealm as well.<br />\nBy representative functions, we mean that the Council has three responsibilities in<br />\nits role as the administration's source of student \"input.\" The three functions are:<br />\nfirst, to responsibly ascertain the opinions of the student body;second,to present the<br />\nmajority opinion with all possible force in meetings with the administration and to<br />\nWork for the implementation of the students' requests; and third, to accurately inform<br />\nthe students with regard to events and opinions which will affect \"the man in the<br />\nquad.\"<br />\nIt is in this latter set of functions that we contend the Council has failed. If we<br />\nexamine the Council's three responsibilities in this area, deficiencies are readily<br />\napparent. It would seem as though Russell Passarella simply is not interested in<br />\nexploring the attitudes of the campus in their diversity. In an earlier editorial, we<br />\nquestioned the ability of any one person to gauge \"student opinion.\" At that time, we<br />\nrecommended referendum as the means to improve the situation. But even if one man<br />\ncannot know the opinions of all, one can try harder than Passarella has. The best that a<br />\nstudent can hope for now, in the way of getting his views across, is to have his SC<br />\nPresident overhear him, as the former talks it all over with Dean Rudoy or Mike Amey.<br />\nEven assuming that Passarella has developed a technique for opinion gathering by osmosis, there is considerable evidence (like the lack of any results, for instance) to<br />\nsuggest that he presents the students' views to the administration with almost no force.<br />\nWhen administrators inevitably pick Passarella or another Council member as the<br />\nexpressor of student views, it is with the comforting knowledge that discussion will be<br />\nheld in a spirit of perfect harmony.<br />\nFinally, as to reporting back to the students whom he omnisciently reflects,<br />\nPassarella demonstrates the administrator's techniques more than their views.<br />\nEmerging from the important meeting which dealt with student representation on the<br />\nAcademic Council, he revealed that the discussion had been \"very frank.\" That such a<br />\nfrank discussion with the University's top policy-makers should have occasioned so<br />\nlittle comment from our \"representative\" is inexcusable.<br /><br />\nI AP311361Ze<br />\nFOR 1-1IJAC4106<br />\nYOUR<br /><br />\nAIRRAIJE,<br /><br />\nAfX THEY toosr<br />\nay&amp; HE STATE<br />\nt2WE FfRHISIotO<br />\nDECAUS5 I'M A<br />\nSTWEr AIJD<br />\nNOT YOuRikKISTL 60 I'M<br />\nIJOt QUALIF(cp<br />\nTO 1-AR)<br />\nABOUT CUBA<br />\nEDP_ MYSELF.<br /><br />\nPAGE 11<br /><br />\nNEWS-LETTER<br /><br />\nPUT I'M A<br />\nSTUPEur<br />\nANP<br />\nWAMTEP<br />\nTO<br />\ni,EARK)<br />\nABOUT<br />\nCUBA<br />\nFOR<br />\nMy5ELF.<br /><br />\nco TO<br />\nCOME<br />\nNuME<br /><br />\nFRGH<br />\nCUBA<br />\nI HAVE<br />\nTO FIRT<br />\n&amp;T0<br />\n!4WD.<br /><br />\nOn the other hand, to effectively represent the students, when dealing with the<br />\nadministration on larger matters, it is often required that the representatives stand<br />\napart from the administration. Indeed, an effective representative must be able to<br />\nstand apart from the entire process of fulfilling day to day functional requirements.<br />\nIn other words, larger questions (calendar reform, providing for an effective student<br />\nvoice in decision making, the relation of research to the University's teaching function)<br />\nrequire a more detached outlook\u2014a larger outlook which should not be restricted by<br />\nthe attempt to work in perfect harmony. Harmony, in fact, should always be<br />\nsecondary to the effort to provide effective and enlightened leadership.<br />\nIt is in this leadership function that we see the Council's inadequacy. To a certain<br />\nextent, it is not only this Council which has failed to deal with the larger questions of<br />\nstudent interest. Passarella, in fact, is no worse than his predecessors. He has a wide<br />\nacquaintance which he might sample to determine opinions. He can express an idea if<br />\nhe ever has one (and probably could in the presence of administrators\u2014as long as it<br />\nwouldn't offend them). And he is fond of demonstrating that he is not averse to<br />\ntalking (though not about what goes on in important meetings).<br />\nThe point is that he is capable of acting responsibly as a representative. However,<br />\nseveral factors prevent his or the Council's ever really becoming effective. First, as has<br />\nbeen mentioned, Council members and the administration need to work closely on<br />\nmatters of day to day administrative functions. The growing amoeba of red tape<br />\nvirtually ingests Council members along with the ideas they campaigned on. Working<br />\nlike an administrator, he almost becomes an administrator.<br />\nSecond and equally important is the consideration of the type of people who are<br />\nelected to the Council. One could acknowledge that Passarella and crew aren't going to<br />\ntry to change anything, but what about next year? We contend that next year will be<br />\nthe same, just as last year was. Council candidates are most often judged on the merits<br />\nof the Shipwreck Ball. To a large extent, campaigns are waged in terms of\"more pool<br />\ntables and better food.\"<br />\nStudent Council candidates must campaign on promises to deliver\u2014the major part of<br />\ntheir appeal must be on the grounds of the concrete. In addition, when they became<br />\nCouncil members, they are judged in terms of their measurable accomplishments.<br />\nWhen students know nothing of how decisions are reached at the University they<br />\ncannot be expected to look into a candidate's ideas. In short the very system in which<br />\nthe Council operates insures that members devote most of their energy to service<br />\nfunctions, it makes it difficult for members to approach service questions and the<br />\nlarger representative questions in different manners and finally it insures that the<br />\npeople elected will be good at delivering and not necessarily as representatives<br /><br />\ncommunicating important opinions.<br />\nOnly if the members of the Council underwent a remaable change of heart could<br />\none expect significant alteration within the present system to remedy this situation.<br />\nSuch a change of heart seems not to be forthcoming. We contend that the path toward<br />\na solution of this problem leads from other groups and individuals on the campus. In<br />\nthe future, we shall present our own alternatives to the present system. It would be<br />\nalmost unfair to expect the very members of the present self-perpetuating set-up to<br />\nprovide for the system's destruction or change. However, the change is possible, it is<br />\nrequired, and it lacks only the attention of the community at large.<br />\nIn a sense, change of a larger nature is at stake here as well. Since Henry Cardinal<br />\nNewman, observers of the university as an institution regard it as a possible force for<br />\ncreative and important change. If Hopkins is to remain such a force\u2014indeed to increase<br />\nits force in this direction, it cannot afford to drag a silent student body. Experience<br />\nwithin the system is certainly important. However, if the present condition continues<br />\nand the observers of the University who bring to it the freshest outlook\u2014the<br />\nundergraduates\u2014are not, or . cannot be heard from, a certain amount of internal<br />\nstagnation is the inevitable result.<br /><br />\nMD THE<br />\nSTATE PEPT<br />\n5Ws THE<br />\n1,E6\\1WAY<br />\nCM GET<br />\nTO CUBA<br />\nis To<br />\nFiRST<br /><br />\nGO TO<br />\nMEXICO.<br />\nsO AArcHoiceDID<br />\nHAVE BUTTO 1-11-JACK<br />\nYOUR<br />\nAIRPI,A0E?<br /><br />\nipd 1..1.11.11t, II dl<br /><br />\nBUT IF I G0<br />\nov Or<br />\n(-arc()<br />\nWITHour<br />\nSTATE CCPTT<br />\nFE,FtillsSioto<br />\nwmetO<br />\ntk,x0i- TO<br />\nHMC<br />\nr<br />\nr<br />\nBE LET<br />\nBACK WO<br />\nHEX(CO<br />\nAS I<br />\nEE IT<br />\n173 A<br />\nRETUPO<br />\n10T16<br />\nCOUCEPF<br />\nWEE<br />\n_a,VEL<br /><br />\nHOMEWOOD,BALTIMORE, FEB. 21, 1969<br /><br />\nNEWS-LETTER<br /><br />\nPAGE 12<br /><br />\nr\u2014Our American Heritage<br />\nI<br /><br />\nPhillips:Non-Voting Can Ile Fun<br />\nBy ED MENDELSOHN<br />\nOne of the least disputed. points<br />\nof American political theory is that it is<br />\nan act of good citizenship to vote, and it<br />\nmay be interesting to consider the<br />\nargument against this proposition which<br />\nwas made by Wendell Phillips.<br />\nPhilLips is one of the; more<br />\ninteresting among the major forces of<br />\nour history because his importance does<br />\nnot derive from his public position; that<br />\nis, he derived no authority from the<br />\noffice of President, Secretary of State or<br />\nChairman of the Board of the<br />\nPennsylvania Railroad. His sources of<br />\nimportance were a musical voice, a<br />\nseries of platform gestures, an easy<br />\ncolloquial manner of discourse, and<br />\nsuch respectability as he could derive<br />\nfrom being the scion of an old New<br />\nEngland family and having the<br />\nacquaintance of such literary types as<br />\nEmerson.<br />\nAdded Notice<br />\nIt need hardly be added that<br />\nHistory has seen many agitators and has<br />\npaused to note only a few of them.<br />\nPhillips merits added notice because so<br />\nmany of his radical proposals have since<br />\nbeen hardened into law. Prior to the<br />\nCivil War he was concerned with<br />\nAbolition; afterwards he insisted that<br />\nthe Federal government had to provide<br />\nfor the civil and economic rights of the<br />\nfreedmen, and also advocated<br />\namelioration of the condition of<br />\nworkingmen and the organization and<br />\nrecognition of strong labor unions.<br />\nThere is no specific piece of<br />\nlegislation which one may consider<br />\npassed because of Phillips' oratory, but<br />\nif the function of agitators is to inject<br />\ntheir advanced positions into the<br />\npolitical conciousness so as to hasten<br />\nthe time when they may be acted on,<br />\nthen future generations did nobly by<br />\nWendell Phillips. In any event, it is safe<br />\nto say that he had more influence than a<br />\ncitizen whose only political act may be<br />\nto vote. But Phillips did not vote.<br />\nIndeed, in 1877 he boasted of this from<br />\nthe platform.<br /><br />\nNo Objections<br />\nIn a private letter, he explained<br />\nthat in his early life he did not object to<br />\nvoting, but did not keep the same<br />\nresidence long enough to ever be able to<br />\ndo so. After acquiring his Abolitionist<br />\nconvictions, he did not feel he could<br />\nvote for a government in which slaves<br />\nwere prohibited from voting. The<br />\nfifteenth Amendment erased this<br />\nobjection, but since then Mr. Phillips<br />\nhad voted only once, simply because he<br />\ndid not find the candidates very<br />\nattractive.<br />\nIt is rather puzzling to read that<br />\nPhillips had cast one vote, rather than<br />\ntwo. In 1871 he was associated with the<br />\nMassachusetts gubernatorial campaign<br />\nof General Benjamin F. Butler and<br />\npresumably voted for Butler (After<br />\nyears of trying, General Butler achieved<br />\nthe Massachusetts executive office in<br />\n1882).<br /><br />\nGubernatorial Candidate<br />\nPhillips himself had been the<br />\ngubernatorial candidate of a small labor<br />\nparty. It is to be hoped that Phillips was<br />\nnot sufficiently overconfident as to fail<br />\nto vote for himself. The final returns<br />\nshowed that Phillips not only had no<br />\nvotes to spare, but required many more<br />\n-yen to make his party competitive.<br />\nSeriously, however, there are<br />\ninconsistencies in Phillips' position. If<br />\nhe did not consider the government<br />\nworthy of soliciting his participation in<br />\nan election, in which he could have<br />\nsupported a reasonably radical group<br />\nsuch as the Free Soilers, one wonders<br />\nwhy he considered it worthy of being<br />\nagitated against. Such agitators as<br />\nPhillips created the moral climate in<br />\nwhich the , Free Soil party and the<br />\nRepublican party grew.

He scorned Jefferson<br />\nas \"a contemptible,\" \"an atheist in<br />\nreligion and a fanatic in politics,\" but he<br />\nalso felt that Burr would lead to war,<br />\ncorruption and usurpation of authority<br /><br />\nand he chose Jefferson. For Hamilton to<br />\nhave declined to make a choice because<br />\nof his objections to both men would<br />\nhave indicated, not high moral stature,<br />\nbut a lack of concern with the national<br />\nwelfare.<br />\nHaving proposed reforms, Phillips<br />\nscorned the choice of men who might<br />\nhave the power to execute his proposals.<br />\nIt was as if he expected to achieve<br />\nreform through moral force alone.<br />\nPerhaps, however, Phillips'<br />\naversion to voting should be considered<br />\nan act of political chastity, a refusal to<br />\nconsort with what he considered a.<br />\nflawed body politic. In itself, failure to<br />\nvote accomplishes nothing. But Mr.<br />\nPhillips was not considered practical,<br />\nand this particular symbolic protest was<br />\nentirely in character.<br /><br />\nJagger,Stones,<br />\nExcite Levine<br />\nBy ART LEVINE<br />\nThe Rolling Stones' new album,<br />\nBeggar's Banquet, is filled with the same<br />\nraw, erotic energy that has endeared<br />\nthem to horny girls the world over. The<br />\nStones are at their decadent, evil best in<br />\nthis album, an album flavored with<br />\ncalypso, folk, country and western, and<br />\ngospel motifs, as well as blues and hard<br />\nrock. Furthermore, Jagger proves<br />\nhimself to be a lyricist of extraordinary<br />\nability in quite a few of the cuts. The<br />\nStones have, in any case, recaptured the<br />\nraunchiness that has made them the Bad<br />\nBoys of rock.<br />\nThe Stones have always had a<br />\nviolent, hood image in the rock field.<br />\nOn their record albums they struck<br />\ndark, sullen poses, their shoulder length<br />\nhair framing faces that scowled at.the<br />\nviewer. In their lifestyle, too,- they<br />\nexhibited the same evil ways. They were<br />\nthe first rock group that everyone was<br />\nsure used drugs. They were rumored to<br />\nbe fags, and yet, at the same time, both<br />\nKeith Richard and Brian Jones were<br />\ninvolved in paternity suits. Scandal is<br />\ncommon to the Stones.<br />\nAbove all, they are sexy. Mick<br />\nJagger, although he has been compared<br />\nto an ugly Vassar girl, was, and still is,<br />\nthe reigning white rock and roll stud.<br />\n(Jim Morrison learned this the hard<br />\nway. At a California concert he shouted,<br />\n\"What do you want?\" and the crowd<br />\nresponded, \"Mick Jagger!\"). In his live<br />\nperformances, Jagger, borrowing a few<br />\ntricks from black soul singers, writhes<br />\nacross the stage, using the mike as a<br />\nphallic extension. Jagger, however, is a<br />\nlittle too conscious of his image, as he is<br />\nknown to stuff his pants with toilet<br />\npaper before a performance in order to<br />\nappear a little fuller in the crotch.<br /><br />\nInternally Grate-Full<br />\nMusically, too, the Stones are not<br />\nknown for their refined taste. Raunchy<br />\nsongs like \"Satisfaction,\" \"Let's Spend<br />\nthe Night Together,\" and \"Get Off of<br />\nMy Cloud,\" exhibit a crudity upsetting<br />\nto many. Their best genre, in my mind,<br />\nis their \"slut\" song, where they take<br />\nsome dumb broad and proceed to dump<br /><br />\nall over her. Songs like \"Stupid Girl,\"<br />\n\"Under My Thumb,\" and \"Back Street<br />\nGirl\" show exactly what they think of<br />\nall the groupies that are part of the rock<br />\nscene. Futhermore, even their recording<br />\njobs are sloppy, adding yet another<br />\ndimension of crudity to the Stones.<br />\nJagger has the irritating down-home<br />\nhabit of mumbling his words, giving<br />\nmost of their records the sparkling<br />\nclarity ofs a Mississippi Delta Field<br />\nrecording. They are, in a word, slobs.<br />\nThis is in great contrast to the<br />\nother reigning rock group, the Beatles.<br />\nThe Beatles, even though they also took<br />\ndrugs, present a much cleaner image.<br />\nThey are more akin to the hippies, while<br />\nthe Stones are closer to the Liverpool<br />\nToughs. Yet, the Stones are undeniable<br />\nsecond to the Beatles, and indeed have<br />\nfollowed the Beatles' lead, just like<br />\neverybody else. Most obviously, the<br />\nStones' atrocious attempt at<br />\npsychedelia, Their Satanic Majesties'<br />\nRequest, was clearly influenced by Sgt.<br />\nPepper's. They have paralleled the<br />\nBeatles in this latest album by returning<br />\nto an earlier stage as the Beatles have<br />\ndone. The contrast with the Beatles is<br />\nmost strikingly apparent by comparing<br />\ntwo recent singles, \"Revolution\" and<br />\n\"Street Fighting Man.\" The first is a<br />\nclear rejection of violence, while the<br />\nlatter is an appeal for violence and<br />\nrevolution. The Beatles, unlike the<br />\nStones, are out of favor with<br />\nGuardian-type dogmatists of the left.<br />\nThe first thing that strikes you<br />\nabout the album is the unity; it is an<br />\nartistic whole. There is none of the<br />\nchoppiness that mars the Beatles' latest<br />\neffort. The album is, fortunately,<br />\nblessed by a total dearth of bombs. The<br />\nbest song in the album is probably<br />\n\"Sympathy for the Devil.\" It is<br />\nmarvelously rythmic, starting off with<br />\ncontrapuntal voodoo drums, and then<br />\nthe wild screams and grunts of the<br />\nStones are heard. Then Jagger's voice<br />\ncomes in, the embodiment of evil, the<br />\nDevil himself:<br />\n(Continued to Page 13)<br /><br />\nRegular Mass Schedule<br /><br />\nSENIORS<br /><br />\nSUNDAYS ..10:30 A.M.- Shaffer Hall Rm.3<br />\nWEEKDAYS 12:05 PM.- Levering Hall Chapel<br /><br />\nTHE SCHOOL OF SOCIAL WORK AT UNIVERSITY OF<br />\nMARYLAND OFFERS A FULLY ACCREDITED<br />\nPROGRAM LEADING TO THE MASTERS DEGREE IN<br />\nSOCIAL WORK.

What joy sets them apart?\"<br />\nThe First Circle by Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn,<br />\nformer prisoner (zek) is the finest single piece of<br />\nliterature to come out of the Soviet Union in this<br />\ndecade.<br />\nIn 1962, Solzhenitsyn published his first major<br />\nwork, One Day in the Life ofIvan Denisovich, the story<br />\n0<br />\n. f a camp zek, a prison laborer condemned to an<br />\nindefinite term of weary starvation and cold in a<br />\nSiberian labor camp. In many ways, The First Circle is a<br />\nmore perfect rewrite of the previous work. The time<br />\nspan is drawn out to four days, the character sketches<br />\nare extended out from the prisoners to the guards, the<br />\nadministators, the wives<br />\non the outside, out to the<br />\nUltimate demon in the throne of hell, the devil<br />\nlinnself\u2014Stalin, the perpetual and absolute writer of<br />\nFate.<br />\nBut if the content alone had been expanded, the<br />\nnovel would have been a bore of suffering, repeating the<br />\nindieu of pain past the point of making a point. In The<br />\nFt.rst Circle, Solzhenitsyn has performed the small<br />\nmiracle of expanding not the reader's pain, but his ethos,<br />\ncjiluting the strength of the pain, by making the agony of<br />\niLvan Denisovich's day into an encyclopedia of subtle<br />\nlia, a four-day, 360 degree tour of the sharashka, the<br />\n'tell of softened flames.<br />\nThe sharashka is a center for special prisoners,<br />\nWhose characters, lives and relations have been<br />\nLondemned<br />\nby the state, but whose intellects are vital to<br />\nthe state's paranoid security needs. Damned but needed,<br />\noutcast but not forgotten, the 281 zeks of the Mavrino<br />\ns_harashka weave tiny and intricate patterns in their<br />\niractured lives<br />\nand in the lives of their captors and loved<br />\nones. The patterns float into actions, the actions into the<br />\ncircles.<br />\nInnokenty Volodin, States Counselor in the<br />\nMinistry of Foreign Affairs, phones a warning to a friend<br />\nabout to be arrested. Camp zeks arrive at Mavrino and<br />\nare introduced to the new layer of hell. The sharashka<br />\nzeks work on a tap-proof telephone for which their<br />\nsuPeriors are responsible to superiors to a chain of<br />\n1\u00b01111mand that ends at the pit of ultimate darkness. The<br />\nnlackness of the novel is here overwhelming, the nexus is<br />\n,exPosed, is exposed: the heart of the brain from which<br />\nihe circles emanate like ripples on a frozen pond. The<br />\nFlovvman. The Old Redeemer. The New Tsar.<br />\nThere follows a slow retreat from the nexus. The<br />\nzek Nerzhin sees his wife for the first time in a year. The<br />\nek. Rubin is assigned to a new project, the detection of<br />\ntvoices by an electronic voiceprint system, December 24<br />\ntough December 27, 1949. Four days in the lives.<br />\n0_,iories are told and remembered. The characters are<br />\nto a golden frustration. The free man, Innokenty<br />\n710din is arrested, receives his citizen training in the<br />\n/lxidst internal state of prison Russia, is a zek. Zeks,<br />\n'N,erzhin among them, are given an hour's notice, then<br />\nPd.eked into a prison wagon whose sides are decorated<br />\nwail the names of foodstuffs. A foreign journalist notes,<br />\nPassing the truck in downtown Moscow:<br />\nc. \"On the streets of Moscow one often sees vans<br />\n'flied with foodstuffs, very neat and hygenically<br />\nhnpeccable. One can only conclude that the provisioning<br />\nn,ls the capital is excellent.\"\u2014the zeks are leaving the<br />\nsnarashka for the labor camps.<br />\nRussia's immensity of geographic freedom<br />\nu\u2018einands the inescapable servitude that has become the<br />\n(-tux of the national character, just as Russia's natural<br />\nabundance engrained starvation on the faces of the<br />\nPopulation. The potentiality of happiness inevitably<br />\n,uegets tragedy\u2014the essence and being of Russian art, the<br />\nlather of the inherent irony. The First Circle as an<br />\n,enThodiment of this theme becomes another step in a<br />\n_lterary tradition at least as old as Pushkin and<br />\nrniontov. It has been a tradition which has explored<br />\ncircumference of man's enslavement to his freedom,<br />\n!us hatred for his love, the guilt upon which is based his<br />\nIn nocence. The ironic content is expressed in the<br />\nne.therworld style of subtle contradictions: the men can<br />\nthink but they are not free, can live comfortably but<br />\nieannot extract satisfaction from that comfort, can create<br />\nnut can only create for their captors... The list is as long<br />\nas Solzhenitsyn's book.<br />\nThe world of The First Circle, then, is a world of<br />\nelements that can interact with each other to a limited<br />\nextent but whose every interaction fits into a greater, all<br />\nencompassing pattern governed by the irony of the<br />\nOOOOOOO<br /><br />\n\"Sexy Sighing ?\"<br />\nI Gasped Hotly<br />\n(Continued from Page 12)<br /><br />\nPlease allow me to introduce myself<br />\nI'm a man of wealth and taste<br />\nI was around when Jesus Christ<br />\nhad his moment of doubt and pain<br />\nmade damn sure that Pilate<br />\nwashed his hands and sealed his fate.<br /><br />\nALEXSANDR 1. SOLZHENITSYN<br /><br />\nconcentric circles of setting: the lab, the sharashka, the<br />\nprison system, the Soviet government, the naked law of<br />\nironic contradiction. Solzhenitsyn's Stalin-Lucifer figure<br />\nis a slip-jacket for the meaning of the book. He is closest<br />\nto the reader, because he is a tangible figure, a bridge<br />\nbetween newspaper reality and literature. At the same<br />\ntime, he is the deepest of the book's abstractions<br />\nembodying the essence of the iron law of ironic<br />\ncontradiction. Solzhenitsyn has renounced the literary<br />\nprivilege/necessity that his characters must be<br />\nunconfirmable (i.e., of so small a stature as to be<br />\nuntraceable or unrecognizable in the \"real\" world of the<br />\nreader and his book), but in so doing has hurled a<br />\nchallenge at the engrained obstacles between the reader<br />\nand the abstraction (documented by fiction) that is not<br />\nin itself fictional.<br />\n\"So Dante thought up a special place for them in<br />\nHell\" This, then, is the reader's first circle, a level of<br />\nHell even more subtle than the sharashka. For the reader<br />\nhimself is drawn into the evil by the Stalin device and<br />\nyet is still a prisoner of the reality of the book. The<br />\nreader's first circle comes into being with his departure<br />\nfrom the objective scrutiny of \"fiction\" and his entry<br />\ninto a document that is, all the same, a piece of<br />\npaper\u2014the reader is free because of the weakness of the<br />\npulp prison, yet still a prisoner to its meaning\u2014the ironic<br />\ncontent of the netherworld of subtle contradiction.<br />\nPerhaps this is the nature of all fiction. It is<br />\nachieved in The First Circle.<br /><br />\nPleased to meet you<br />\nhope you guess my name<br />\nbut why puzzlin' you<br />\nwith the nature of my game.<br />\nYou realize soon that Jagger is charting the Devil's<br />\ntouch throughout the centuries. We are given a tour<br />\nthrough the Russian revolution, the blitzkrieg, the<br />\nKennedy assassinations, and other historical events. At<br />\nthe same time the Stones have taken up a cooing,<br />\nrepetitive harmony and the song accelerates in tempo<br />\nand intensity. At the end of this diabolical song, the<br />\nDevil threateningly introduces himself. There is an<br />\norgasmic fade out (the Stones are fadeout masters) with<br />\nJagger wailing in a high pitched voice, \"Tell me, baby,<br />\nwhat's my name?\" and cooing like a fiend. There is not a<br />\nconcert hall in the world Lhat wouldn't be burnt to the<br />\nground ten minutes after a performance of this song.<br />\nBlack Like White<br />\nAnother outstanding song is a country blues,<br />\nProdigal Son. It is the best country blues(a purely black<br />\nart form) by a white man I have ever heard. John<br />\nHammond, John Mayall, and \"Spider\" John Koerner,<br />\namong others, have tried to preserve and imitate the<br />\ncountry blues sound of greats like Robert Johnson,<br />\nSleepy John Estes, and Son House, but none of them has<br />\ndone it with the skill of Mick Jagger. Prodigal Son is a<br />\ndead ringer for a field recording of the 1930's. Jagger<br />\nmust have a blues record collection . bigger than the<br />\n'Library of Congress to be able to do country blues so<br />\nwell.<br />\nIn any case, the album has other equally excellent<br />\nsongs. \"Factory Girl,\" the Dylanesque \"Jig-Saw Puzzle,\"<br />\nand \"Salt of the Earth\" are all well done, melodically<br />\nand lyrically. Jagger shouldn't have to mumble his words<br />\nso much\u2014they are very much worth hearing. It is<br />\nwithout a doubt the best album the Stones have ever<br />\ndone, and one of the best of the year.

The individualists stare into each<br />\nother's eyes and yet deny the existence of each other.\"<br />\n--Ingmar Bergman, Introduction to Four<br />\nScreenplays ofIngmar Bergman<br />\nThe movie opens at dawn in the bedroom of Jan<br />\nand Eva Rosenberg. They sleep in separate beds. The<br />\nalarm rings and Eve awakens, turns off the alarm, throws<br />\nopen the curtains and light comes streaming into the<br />\nroom. As she walks from the window (we see her<br />\nreflection in the mirrow at the foot of Jan's bed) to go<br />\nabout her morning ablutions Jan gets up, puts on his<br />\nglasses and slippers, and sits looking out the window. He<br />\ntells Eva, who is in front of the wash basin, mirrow<br />\nabove, of a dream he had. They were back in the<br />\norchestra, before all the trouble between them. Eva ,<br />\nmerely remarks that he has stopped shaving.<br />\nImplicit in this scene are most of the devices,<br />\nthematic and cinematic, which Bergman uses to build<br />\nShame. Most important are windows, for shame is a<br />\nmatter of being seen. Bergman constantly makes shots<br />\nthrough windows, often done so that one can see<br />\nreflections in the window as well as being able to see<br />\nthrough the window\u2014as though Bergman were saying<br />\nthat that which allows us to see into the world also<br />\ncondemns us to seeing our own reflection, that which<br />\nconnects us to others also separates us from them. The<br />\nsunlight streaming through the window will reappear in<br />\nthe literally blinding flashes of light in the bombardment<br />\nscenes where one is obliged to blink and squint in order<br />\nto shut out the light; thereby the viewer becomes<br />\nacutely aware of his eyes\u2014just as Bergman's camera<br />\nfollows Eva's, Jan's and Jacobi's eyes. Shame is through<br />\nthe eyes.<br />\nThat something is wrong between Jan and Eva is<br />\nthe precondition of the film and not the conclusion;<br />\nBergman is not stating an argument where he gives<br />\npremises and reasons to an inescapable<br />\nconclusion\u2014rather he merely states what is. There is<br />\nsomething wrong. When he tells his dream (looking<br />\nthrough the window) Jan is addressing himself and the<br />\nworld as much as he is addressing Eva. And she isn't<br />\nlistening; she merely notes that he hasn't shaved. They<br />\nlive in two worlds which just happen (chance,<br />\ncontingency) to coincide\u2014at points.<br />\nFrom this simple beginning Bergman constructs a<br />\nfilm\u2014in much the way Bach constructs a complicated.<br />\ncontrapuntal piece from a simple idea. Ostensibly we<br />\nwatch the degradation wrought on Jan and Eva through'<br />\ntheir efforts to escape a Wdj which is meaningless to<br />\nthem and which they don't give a damn about. But they<br />\ncannot escape? things are always one step ahead of<br /><br />\nthem\u2014the bridge is blocked by the wreckage of a tank<br />\nwhen they get there. They end up in a small boat in the<br />\nsea. Just floating.<br />\nShame \u2022<br />\nBut Shame is no impotent existential cry of<br />\nanguish at the hopelessness of the human condition;<br />\nrather, Bergman penetrates into the very center of that<br />\nexistential cry\u2014and the only diagnostic clue is the<br />\nubiquitous windows which reflect sight as well as,<br />\ntransmit sight. The real course of the film is from the<br />\nsurface of a human condition to the very core of that<br />\ncondition. We start with the Rosenbergs. To be sure,<br />\nthey quarrel, they speak more at each other than to each<br />\nother. But their marriage is no worse than most. Still,<br />\nthey are childless and this bothers Eva;it doesn't bother<br />\nJan. As the narrative moves forward into the war,<br />\nBergman penetrates inward beneath the merely flawed<br />\nsurface of the Rosenbergs' marriage to the real war<br />\nbeneath. The deeper the Rosenbergs are sucked into the<br />\nevents of the war around them the more their own<br />\nrelationship deteriorates. To be more exact, Bergman<br />\nuses the external war, quite meaningless to the viewer<br />\nwho has no idea who the good and bad guys are as a<br />\ndevice to pare away the outer layers of the Rosenbergs<br />\nand get down to the agonizingly empty core. Just as we<br />\nmust take the war as given so we must take the final<br />\naimless floating at sea as given, as the human individual<br />\ninterior of which the war is the social exterior. The film<br />\nmoves from outside to inside rather than from beginning<br />\nto end.<br />\nShame is that the exterior always betrays the<br />\ninterior, the interior which tries to keep itself contained<br />\nentirely within its own interiority\u2014in the way a young<br />\nchild will close his eyes so that no one else can see him.<br />\nA group of paratroopers forces Jan and Eva to give a TV<br />\ninterview and Jan's' heart skips a beat (he does have a<br />\nweak heart) and he faints. They are later accused of<br />\ncollaboration with the enemy and the interview is shown<br />\nas evidence. Eva's voice has been erased and another<br />\nvoice dubbled in saying that they have longed for<br />\nliberation and they welcome their liberators. Jan and<br />\nEva plead that the interview was a forgery\u2014as it was. Or<br />\nwas it: When the interview was filmed the paratrooper's<br />\ncamera was pointing towards us; we saw the side of Eva<br />\naway from the camera. When the film was shown during<br />\ninterrogation we saw the same side seen by the enemy<br />\ncamera. And we heard a different voice saying something<br />\ndifferent. But Eva, and Jan as well, really do long for<br />\nliberation; the dubbed in voice spoke the truth which<br />\nwas on the other side of Eva's evasion, just as the<br />\ninterviewer's camera was on the other side from<br />\nBergman's camera. Thus Bergman betrays to us Jan and<br />\nEva's desire to be liberated from meaninglessness; a<br />\ndesire they never formulate to themselves. And just as<br />\nBergman betrays them to us, so they betray themselves<br />\nto each other. As their friend, Jacobi, the mayor, says,<br />\nthere is \"no-where to hide, no evasions, no excuses, only<br />\na great guilt.\"<br />\nSham<br />\nJan and Eva don't want each other; they only<br />\nwant their own autonomy. They don't want the war<br />\neither. But it is there and it forces than to need each<br /><br />\nother. Their shame lies in the fact that they are forced to<br />\nneed what they don't want\u2014each other. The war exposes,<br />\nthem to each other by disrupting their everyday lives<br />\nuntil at the end they don't speak to each other. They<br />\nmerely exist touching each other in the boat. Floating.<br />\nAnd through the device of meaningless, denial of<br />\ncontext, Bergman exposes us to ourselves. The war is so<br />\ncontextless that we can only except it as a brute<br />\nfact\u2014and as a metaphor for a human condition. The final<br />\nscene is just floating. By that time we have gone far<br />\nbeyond the question of whether or not the boat Will<br />\nreach the mainland\u2014for the Rosenbergs' have made an<br />\nisland the scene of their subjective insularity. There is<br />\nneither beginning nor end to floating\u2014only the<br />\ncontingency of being. Why not suicide? Because Jan and<br />\nEva are just floating; they only go where they have been<br />\npushed. Suicide is an act of the will.<br />\nShame<br />\nBut Filip, the boatman, does slip over the<br />\n1<br />\nside-quietly, to death. Why? The answer is shame. Filip<br />\nappeared<br />\nfirst<br />\nhe<br />\nanything;<br />\nis the only one who does<br />\na<br />\nearly in the picture as a friend from whom Jan and Eva<br />\nthe<br />\nof<br />\nnews<br />\nfirst<br />\ntheir<br />\nthem<br />\nbought fish\u2014he gave<br />\ninvasion. He later appeared as the head of some people's<br />\n(peasants') organization which was on one side or other,<br />\nin the war, or perhaps on its own side. He was<br />\nresponsible for the death of Jacobi, who was<br />\nEstablishment flunky - in the area.

We heard he had blinding speed,<br />\ninstant acceleration, the quickness of a cat, Herculean strength, a<br />\nfierce will to win, and enough moves to force Jimmy On and Jimmy<br />\nLewis to retire simultaneously. His name was Joe Cowan. Being<br />\ncynical and somewhat sophisticated, I, for one, discounted those<br />\nbrash rumors. Pfui.<br />\nOf course, since then, Joe Cowan has been All-American in<br />\nboth lacrosse and football for two consecutive years(not to mention<br />\nthe leagues most valuable football player. and the nation's best<br />\nattackman). However, a lot of Hoppies may have missed his latest<br />\nand perhaps most significant accomplishment: he was drafted<br />\nby the<br />\nBaltimore Colts. Believe it or not, Upton Bell and Don Shula picked<br />\nJoe Cowan to play with that same Jimmy Orr, not to mention the<br />\nlikes of John Mackey, Ray Perkins, Alex Hawkins, Ed Hinton<br />\nand<br />\nDavid Lee with whom he will have to compete.<br />\nJohns Hopkins may have more players in the Lacrosse Hall of<br />\name than all the other colleges put together, but Joe Cowan is the<br />\nlust of its gridiron heroes to even be drafted.<br />\nUpton Bell, the Director of Player Personnel and one of the<br />\n,moving forces behind the Colt draft picks, has described Cowan as a<br />\n\"stronger Jimmy Orr.\" Mr. Bell, when asked why the Colts went<br />\nwith \"Super Joe\" (II), replied that Joe was just such an all around<br />\nfantastic athlete that the Colts couldn't pass him by (indeed, his<br />\nexact words were \"One hell of an athlete\"). He could catch, run,<br />\ntackle, and<br />\nkick and there wasn't too much else left for a football<br />\nPlayer to do.<br />\nJoe's lack of specialization and his underdeveloped abilities<br />\nseem to<br />\nbe his major assets. Coach Alex Sotir, Super Joe's gridiron<br />\nmentor for two years, believes that if Cowan does stick with the<br />\nteam, it<br />\nwill be as a punter. This is because David Lee the Colt<br />\nPunter, does nothing but punt, and, for the last two years, hasn't<br />\nexactly excelled at even that.<br />\nThe Colts know that Joe has never<br />\nteallY worked at his punting and feel that with the proper attention,<br />\nCould<br />\nimprove significantly.<br />\nBut neither Joe Cowan, nor Alex Sotir will downgrade the<br />\ntremendous challenge awaiting Joe. He cannot expect to brake in as<br />\na flanker for several years on a team with one of<br />\nthe best passing<br />\nattacks in pro-football. Rather, he will need to shine immediately<br />\nand consistently as a man who can do a little of everything - who can<br />\nPunt as well as David Lee, who can run the ball when necessary, who<br />\nmake tackles on specialty teams, and even return the ball<br />\nnirnself. But most of all, Joe Cowan will have to be a hungry ball<br />\nPelayer.<br />\nThere will be players who have nothing fall back on if the<br />\ntiolts release them, players who have known<br />\nnothing but football<br />\nuteir whole lives. Joe's reaction can only be described as excitement<br />\nc\u00b011Pled with determination. He knows that the odds have been<br />\nstacked against him even as they have been for the last two years<br />\nwhen he has met defenses designed exclusively to stop him.<br />\n,<br />\n14<br />\nOne advantage he might have is the very fact that he is from<br />\n\"<br />\n,ai<br />\n4-more. The Colts have garnered some criticism for never drafting<br />\nrine twon boys and perhaps this will in some way influence their<br />\nZeision. At any rate, Joe has the examples of Preston Pearson,<br />\n_Ltafted when still a basketball player, and Gene Alley, another 17th<br />\n0,11nd draft choice who Mr. Bell expects to make the<br />\nteam this year.<br />\nmight be worthwhile to note that Alley was kept on for more than<br />\nre year and is only now blossoming. So don't be surprised if a<br />\niple of years from now there really is another Super Joe, only in<br />\nnaltnnore instead of New York.<br /><br />\nF<br /><br />\n1<br /><br />\nPAGE 17<br /><br />\nGrapplers Encounter Garnets<br />\nAfter Devastating C.U.

Other<br />\nvictories came against Towson<br />\nState, PMC, Swarthmore,<br />\nHaverford, and Georgetown. The<br />\ntwo losses came at the hands of<br />\nDrexel and Loyola both by<br />\n51-44 scores, decided by the<br />\nfinal relay.<br />\nIn looking back over the<br />\nseason, one has to be pleased<br />\nwith the progress of the team.<br />\nOnly against Loyola did the<br />\nteam look flat. Yet it would be<br />\nfolly to hide the fact that the<br />\nJays have weaknesses along with<br />\ntheir numerous strengths. A look<br />\nat some statistics will indicate<br />\nboth.<br />\nIn previous years, Hopkins<br />\nwas effective only in butterfly<br /><br />\nand diving. Freestyle and<br />\nbackstroke were only adequate<br />\nand breaststroke was<br />\nhorrendous. This year, while all<br />\nevents have grown immeasurably<br />\nstronger, the Jays have grown<br />\ninto primarily a \"stroke\" team,<br />\ntheir strongest events being the<br />\nmedley relay, fly, back, and<br />\nbreaststroke. Distance freestyle<br />\nsprints and free relay where lack<br />\nof depth hurts. This lineup does,<br />\nhowever give Hopkins a decided<br />\nedge in Mason-Dixon<br />\ncompetition which adds both<br />\nthe 1000 yd. freestyle and three<br />\nmeter diving to the regular<br />\nlineup. Both defeats this year<br />\ncame in MAC lineups: Against<br />\nDrexel and Loyola the Jays<br />\ndropped the 100, 200, 500<br />\nfreestyle and the final freestyle<br />\nrelay, plus the individual<br />\nmedley. At Drexel, Hopkins also<br />\nlost the diving while against<br />\nLoyola the Jays dropped the 50<br />\nfreestyle.<br />\nHopkins strategy this year<br />\nhas concentrated on winning the<br />\nopening medley relay, sweeping<br />\nthe stroke events and distance<br />\nfreestyle, and avoiding sweeps in<br />\nthe sprints, thus clinching the<br />\nmeet before the final relay. The<br />\nJays are undefeated in the<br />\nbutterfly and 1000 yard<br />\nfreestyle, only once beaten in<br />\nthe breastroke and backstroke.<br /><br />\nHopkins students, new and old,eat at:<br /><br />\nPecora's Restaurant<br />\nfor the finest italion food in town<br /><br />\nty<br /><br />\n3320 Greenmount Ave.<br /><br />\nIS<br /><br />\nto<br /><br />\n;(1<br />\n3.<br />\n1d<br />\nus<br /><br />\nill<br /><br />\nre<br /><br />\n0.<br /><br />\niit<br /><br />\nJe<br />\na<br /><br />\nSPAGHETTI MEALS<br />\nPIZZA PIE A SPECIALTY<br /><br />\nNfteimilosik<br /><br />\nIt i<br />\na I<br /><br />\nb.<br />\nof<br /><br />\nHOWARD at 27th ST.<br />\nENJOY A<br /><br />\n;11<br /><br />\nie<br />\n;1\u2018<br /><br />\nas<br />\na<br /><br />\n;(1<br /><br />\n11,<br />\nre<br />\nof<br /><br />\nd.<br /><br />\nif<br /><br />\nLast Monday night's basketball games had<br />\nno big surprises.
