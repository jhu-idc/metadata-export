Marburg as a memorial<br />\nto their late brother, the late Charles<br />\nLouis Marburg.<br />\nDr. Isaiah Bowman, president of<br />\nthe university, stated that at the<br />\ntime of the gift it was not considered<br />\ndesirable to erect the building immediately because of existing conditions; and with the consent of the<br />\ndonors, the income from the grant<br />\nhas been used for general expenses<br />\nof the school until now. The original gift was $50,000, but with the<br />\ndeath of William Marburg, the surviving brother and sister made another bequest of $30,000.<br />\nAdditional Sum Added<br />\nIn addition to the $80,000 an additional sum has been provided, which<br />\nwill be sufficient to pay for heating<br />\nand lighting the new club building.<br />\nThus, through the foresight and generosity of the donors, the club will<br />\nbe operated without any expenditure<br />\nof the university's funds.<br />\nCommenting on the gift, Dr. Bowman said: \"I regard the Marburg<br />\ngift as evidence of the faith of the<br />\ndonors in the present as well as the<br />\nfuture usefulness of the university.<br />\nBoth faculty and trustees welcome<br />\nthe gift as a memorial to members of<br />\na family which has been closely associated with the Hopkins for many<br />\nyears and whose members have always displayed a keen and intelligent<br />\ninterest in the cultural development<br />\nof Baltimore.\"<br />\nOf Georgian Design<br />\nThe building will be a two-story<br />\nstructure of Georgian design in harmony with the rest of the buildings<br />\nat Homewood.

One of the<br />\nwings will contain a billiard room<br />\nand the other wing will contain a dining room for women connected with<br />\nthe university. A smoking room,<br />\nlocker rooms, and showers will occupy the basement.<br />\nAt the request of the donors, the<br />\nbuilding will be considered as a memorial to both Charles, Louis, and William Marburg.

There<br />\nare those who see clearly the enormous suffering in the world and those<br />\nwho ,blindly prosper by its perpetration.<br />\nIt is truly astonishing how little these prosperous ones know of the<br />\ndistasteful truths behind contemporary strikes, wars, and tyrannies. There<br />\nis a sort of middle-class genius at building a world in which mass ugliness is safely concealed from view.<br />\nSo, it has interested me of late to discover what happens to the<br />\nreputations of Great Men in the hands of these two groups\u2014so sharply<br />\ndivided in their outlook at the present time.<br />\nNow, I feel quite sure that this is a time of truly Great Men. And<br />\nGreat Men are as rare as active volcanoes. Here and abroad, there is such<br />\nan abundance of volcanic demagogues\u2014the like of which has hardly been<br />\nseen since the Renaissance. Yet where is the audience to rejoice in such<br />\nfertility?<br />\nOn one side, my social-injustice friends get quite hysterical at the<br />\nmention of Hitler, Mussolini, or Kemal Pasha. And, on the other, it would<br />\nseem, my exploitatory friends don't know or care about them. As to that,<br />\na recent Fortune survey statistically revealed large numbers quite indiferent to whatever goes on outside of their immediate-neighbor's beds.<br />\nAnd, from every indication, when they finally find out the truth, they will<br />\ngo hysterically the other way\u2014to Fascism.<br />\nAlready, it appears, a clans-war of hysterical sympathies is starting<br />\nwith the Great Men's reputations being completely warped on both sides.<br />\nFew of the reading public today regard such men as Hitler, Mussolini, Stalin, Rev. Coughlin, and Herb Hoover as human beings any more<br />\n\u2014complete with mothers, opinions, high blood pressure, kidney trouble,<br />\nor bad investments. In short, publicists, who are the most vehement of<br />\nmen, don't assign to dictators the qualities which distinguish humans<br />\nfrom god-heads, on one hand, and beasts, on the other. Some radical<br />\nspokesmen, for example, regard Stalin as a plaster saint and Hitler as<br />\na plaster devil, an impossible beast.

In general, we tend to look at our Great very much as the superstitious peas-<br />\n<br />\nI<br />\n<br />\nI<br />\n<br />\nSTRIKE<br />\n<br />\nants of the Middle Ages used to regard dragons, ogres, and elves. It was<br />\nimpossible for one of those peasants to conceive that an ogre might have<br />\n<br />\nBRAND<br />\n<br />\nB<br />\n<br />\nbladder trouble, just as much as he had.<br />\nThus I decided to write a series of short plays\u2014returning our Great<br />\nMen to the human fold (and when I say \"human\", I don't necessarily<br />\n<br />\nBRAND<br />\n<br />\nC<br />\n<br />\nBRAND<br />\n<br />\nD<br />\n<br />\nI<br />\n<br />\nmean that always as a compliment).<br />\nBut to humanize a Hitler demands an apology. For so far has the<br />\ncurrent hysteria advanced that I must go at length to argue that there<br />\nis really some reason for doing it. In brief, my reason is that the contemplation of remarkable human beings in their array of true colors is<br />\none of the great joys of life. In the midst of all the madness of murders<br />\nand glory, all of us can take a little time out and bring down the cutthroats from their horses with an Aristophanic roar. That is the end<br />\nof living. That roar of the intellect gives you faith in the riches of life,<br />\nwhatever your station\u2014and what else can now do a like service? It's<br />\nray of sunshine in an otherwise capitalistic world!<br />\nNow to unhorse a tyrant, you need little trite incidents. What would<br />\nhappen, I ask, if the common situations which are customary in theatrical plots happen to the world's mighty, just as to other matinee idols?<br />\nBut here's the problem. It is next to impossible to discover such<br />\nmortal incidents in the real life of our present dictators. They're all wellhidden. As all our tyrants have risen democratically and unheralded,<br />\nthere was no biographer to catch them in their obscurity\u2014as was the<br />\ncase in the absurd, but recorded rise of the third Napoleon. Such mortal<br />\nyouths are known only to the tyrants themselves, for obviously it's bad<br />\nbusiness to expose such facts and thus establish blood kinship to one's<br />\nvery humblest subject.<br />\nNow I don't really know what bits of scarlet color, Hoover, Hitler,<br />\nand Stalin have. Therefore, I am inventing bits for them. And that, as<br />\nyou know, amounts to libel!<br />\nBut a libel is unethical, you say. And from one point of view, I suppose it is. But let us remember the loftiness of our aim. We are libeling<br />\nas the only method of making human our fellow creatures of Earth.<br />\nThe Greeks\u2014Aristophanes--used it. Why can't we in the good old U. S.<br />\nA.? There's plenty of immorality in American business tactics. So,<br />\nwhy can't there be just a little in American letters? To the officials who<br />\nhave already banned an Elmer Rice portrayal of the Great Men of the<br />\nworld, I say, gentlemen, let's play the game. Writers will stop picking<br />\non crooked Babbitts, if the latter stop on crooked literati.<br />\nI have now almost completed three plays in the technique above discussed. The portraits are as lifelike as the facts permit. Whether I have<br />\nbeen successful remains to be seen. But I am convinced that the libel is<br />\n\u2014and rightly so\u2014a brilliant literary tool. What with Walter Winchell<br />\net al, it really should need no introduction in the United States.

Finally<br />\nRachel puts down her magazine<br />\nand looks directly at Milly.)<br />\nRachel: You must be \"Milly.\"<br />\nMilly: Why, yes\u2014that's my name<br />\n. . How did you know?<br />\nRachel: I've heard Gordon speak<br />\nof you so often.<br />\nMilly: Gordon? Are you a friend<br />\nof his?<br />\nRachel: A very old friend.

You satisfy one<br />\nside, and I the other.<br />\nMilly: Oh, I see\u2014the difference between love and friendship.<br />\nRachel: No, it's not that. There always will be something between us<br />\nstronger than just\u2014friendship.<br />\nDoctor (Coming in): All right, you<br />\ncan see him now for just a minute.<br />\n(As Rachel gets up.) No, not you,<br />\nMiss Tudor. I'm sorry, but we can't<br />\nlet him have any added excitement<br />\njust now.<br />\nDoctor (to Milly): Didn't you say<br />\nyour first name was Milly?<br />\nMilly (Excited): Yes.<br />\nDoctor: He's been calling for you<br />\nall the time he was delirious. The<br />\nnurse says he kept moaning and<br />\ntalking, and crying, \"Milly! Milly!\"<br />\nI think it will quiet him if he can<br />\nsee you for a little while.<br />\n(Milly is starting to cry, so<br />\nshe just nods.)<br />\nNurse (Coming in): Here are your<br />\nflowers, Miss Tudor.

She stands there<br />\nfor a moment\u2014a lovely picture.<br />\nThen she breaks away and goes<br />\ndown the hall.)<br />\nNurse: Well! I never did see such<br />\na selfish, thoughtless\u2014<br />\nRachel: Oh, it's all right. It doesn't<br />\nmake any difference \u2014 just so he<br />\ngets them.<br />\n<br />\nDoctor: I hope you understand,<br />\nMiss Tudor. He really ought not to<br />\nsee anybody right now, but I thought<br />\nit was best to let him see her\u2014just<br />\nto ease his mind a little.<br />\nRachel: Yes, I understand.<br />\n(Exit Doctor.)<br />\nNurse (Awkwardly coming over to<br />\nRachel): Poor dear, you don't look<br />\nwell\u2014not a bit. What you need is<br />\nsome rest\u2014staying here all day and<br />\nso late at night. And I can't make<br />\nyou eat a thing.<br />\nRachel (Lifelessly): Oh, I'm all<br />\nright.<br />\nNurse: He's what I'd call a finelooking man. Not handsome, you understand, but something that's a lot<br />\nmore important. He has an interesting face.<br />\nRachel: Yes, he is awfully attractive. I remember the first time I saw<br />\nhim \u2014<br />\nNurse: Ah, love at first sight?<br />\nRachel: No, not love\u2014that came<br />\nlater. But just recognition\u2014the recognition that we could mean so much<br />\nto each other.<br />\nNurse: And so you've gone tokether ever since.<br />\nRachel: Yes. At times, he's sort of<br />\nwandered off\u2014but he's always come<br />\nback to me. This time\u2014I'm not so<br />\nsure he will.<br />\nNurse: Don't you feel badly? When<br />\nhe gets well he'll know who's been<br />\nfaithful to him\u2014he'll know. Well . . .<br />\nI guess I've got to run along now.<br />\nRachel: Thank you. You've been so<br />\nkind to me.<br />\n(Exit nurse. Maly enters. She<br />\nseems changed\u2014more subdued.)<br />\nRachel: Well, how is he?<br />\nMilly: I think he's going to be all<br />\nright. He was quite conscious\u2014knew<br />\nme right away. But, oh\u2014it seems so<br />\nstrange, so wrong to see him lying<br />\nthere that way. He's so pale and<br />\nlistless\u2014not at all like he usually is.<br />\nRachel (Kindly): Was he happy<br />\nto see you?<br />\nMilly: Oh, yes\u2014very. He seemed<br />\ntired, though, so I wouldn't let him<br />\ntalk much, and he finally dropped<br />\noff to sleep with his head in my arms.,<br />\n(Rachel winces.)<br />\nRachel ,(Suddenly\u2014after a little<br />\npause): Milly, dear, you're not the<br />\none for Gordon.<br />\nMilly: I guess Gordon has the right<br />\n<br />\nto choose for himself, hasn't he?<br />\nRachel: You see, Gordon is essentially a one-woman man.<br />\nMilly: Yes, I think so, too. But\u2014<br />\nRachel: Milly, there's no reason for<br />\nus to be so opposed to each other<br />\nafter all, we both have the same<br />\nthing at heart--Cordon's happiness.<br />\nInstead of being jealous of each other, we ought to get together and try<br />\nto find the best way to make him<br />\nhappy.<br />\nMilly: You're a grand person, Rachel. Of course we will!<br />\nRachel: I think marriage is the<br />\nthing for Gordon. He has so much<br />\nenergy\u2014he could do so much if he<br />\nwere only guided in the right direction.<br />\n(There are excited voices in<br />\nthe halls.)<br />\n(Man's Voice: Quick!

But we've<br />\ngotten beyond that stage. The novelty of our love has worn off, and<br />\nwe have instead a fine, clear understanding of each other.<br />\nMilly: You love him very much,<br />\ntoo, don't you?<br />\nRachel: Yes .. . Yes, I love him so<br />\nmuch that I would gladly get out of<br />\nhis life . . . if I could only be sure<br />\nthat you would be good for him.<br />\nMilly: And why not? We're both<br />\n<br />\nso crazy about each other\u2014<br />\nRachel: Yes, but will it last?<br />\nMilly: I'll always adore him.<br />\nRachel: How can you be sure?<br />\nYou're awfully young. He flatters<br />\nyou by his attentions, his boyish eagerness. But if you knew him as I<br />\ndo, I wonder if you'd feel the same?<br />\nMilly: I just can't imagine life<br />\nwithout him.<br />\nRachel: No, of course not\u2014not<br />\nnow. But by the time you're as old<br />\nas I am, you'll probably have changed<br />\nyour mind a couple of times.<br />\n(There is more hurrying in the<br />\nhalls.)<br />\nIf you let him get used to your<br />\naffection and then snatch it away<br />\nsuddenly, it would ruin him.<br />\nMilly: Oh, why can't we go on the<br />\nway we have been? Let him have<br />\nboth of us\u2014 or let's all three be<br />\nfriends..<br />\nRachel: No, dear, it just wouldn't<br />\nwork for Gordon. The only thing is<br />\nfor one of us to walk out of that door<br />\nand out of his life. I'll tell you what<br />\nwe'll do. Go sit down over there and<br />\nask yourself honestly if you are one<br />\nwho can do the most for him.

The original gift was $50,000, but with the<br />\ndeath of William Marburg, the surviving brother and sister made another bequest of $30,000.<br />\nAdditional Sum Added<br />\nIn addition to the $80,000 an additional sum has been provided, which<br />\nwill be sufficient to pay for heating<br />\nand lighting the new club building.<br />\nThus, through the foresight and generosity of the donors, the club will<br />\nbe operated without any expenditure<br />\nof the university's funds.<br />\nCommenting on the gift, Dr. Bowman said: \"I regard the Marburg<br />\ngift as evidence of the faith of the<br />\ndonors in the present as well as the<br />\nfuture usefulness of the university.<br />\nBoth faculty and trustees welcome<br />\nthe gift as a memorial to members of<br />\na family which has been closely associated with the Hopkins for many<br />\nyears and whose members have always displayed a keen and intelligent<br />\ninterest in the cultural development<br />\nof Baltimore.\"<br />\nOf Georgian Design<br />\nThe building will be a two-story<br />\nstructure of Georgian design in harmony with the rest of the buildings<br />\nat Homewood. It will be situated on<br />\nthe north side of the university's<br />\nbotanical gardens facing the botanical laboratory behind Gilman Hall.<br />\nA lounge, dining rooms, card and<br />\ncloak rooms, etc. have been provided<br />\nfor in the central part of the building by the architects. One of the<br />\nwings will contain a billiard room<br />\nand the other wing will contain a dining room for women connected with<br />\nthe university. A smoking room,<br />\nlocker rooms, and showers will occupy the basement.<br />\nAt the request of the donors, the<br />\nbuilding will be considered as a memorial to both Charles, Louis, and William Marburg.

There<br />\nare those who see clearly the enormous suffering in the world and those<br />\nwho ,blindly prosper by its perpetration.<br />\nIt is truly astonishing how little these prosperous ones know of the<br />\ndistasteful truths behind contemporary strikes, wars, and tyrannies. There<br />\nis a sort of middle-class genius at building a world in which mass ugliness is safely concealed from view.<br />\nSo, it has interested me of late to discover what happens to the<br />\nreputations of Great Men in the hands of these two groups\u2014so sharply<br />\ndivided in their outlook at the present time.<br />\nNow, I feel quite sure that this is a time of truly Great Men. And<br />\nGreat Men are as rare as active volcanoes. Here and abroad, there is such<br />\nan abundance of volcanic demagogues\u2014the like of which has hardly been<br />\nseen since the Renaissance. Yet where is the audience to rejoice in such<br />\nfertility?<br />\nOn one side, my social-injustice friends get quite hysterical at the<br />\nmention of Hitler, Mussolini, or Kemal Pasha. And, on the other, it would<br />\nseem, my exploitatory friends don't know or care about them. As to that,<br />\na recent Fortune survey statistically revealed large numbers quite indiferent to whatever goes on outside of their immediate-neighbor's beds.<br />\nAnd, from every indication, when they finally find out the truth, they will<br />\ngo hysterically the other way\u2014to Fascism.<br />\nAlready, it appears, a clans-war of hysterical sympathies is starting<br />\nwith the Great Men's reputations being completely warped on both sides.<br />\nFew of the reading public today regard such men as Hitler, Mussolini, Stalin, Rev. Coughlin, and Herb Hoover as human beings any more<br />\n\u2014complete with mothers, opinions, high blood pressure, kidney trouble,<br />\nor bad investments. In short, publicists, who are the most vehement of<br />\nmen, don't assign to dictators the qualities which distinguish humans<br />\nfrom god-heads, on one hand, and beasts, on the other. Some radical<br />\nspokesmen, for example, regard Stalin as a plaster saint and Hitler as<br />\na plaster devil, an impossible beast. And the Hearst press is just about<br /><br />\nThis though is good, but you see it<br />\nlimps and halts.<br />\nNot in earth-shaking words of thunder<br />\nThe angry God's high wrath burst<br />\nforth,<br />\nBut quietly came the curse that left<br />\nthem still with wonder:<br />\nAmong thy sons shall live forever<br />\nhence<br />\nA tortured few, never knowing rest,<br />\nYearning to make Beauty, and agonized with impotence!<br /><br />\nOF RICH, RIPE-BODIED TOBACCO \"IT'S TOASTED\"<br /><br />\nVAGRANT<br />\nThe cooling breeze, incense laden,<br />\nfragrant<br />\nWith honeysuckle's pungent breath;<br />\nThe whispered monologue of trees\u2014<br />\nThey held no charms for one of these:<br />\nShadows and shells of men\u2014vagrant.<br />\nNow brown, now green, as wave on<br />\nwave the wheat<br />\nRolled surging in the wind and<br />\nbroke<br />\nIn little rustling on the lea,<br />\nSome flotsam leaves whirled on this<br />\nsea\u2014<br />\nFlotsam (wreckage of the streets)<br />\nTrudged by like the derelict leaves<br />\non fields of grain,<br />\nDriven by the winds of hunger;<br />\nPlodding in the midst of the spring,<br />\nNo answering voice in their hearts<br />\nto sing;<br />\nOnly hunger and the winds of pain.<br />\nHow long since they had felt some<br />\ngentle touch;<br />\nHad heard some woman's wellloved voice?<br />\nHow long since love on them had<br />\nsmiled;<br />\nSince they were welcomed by a child<br />\nWith happy laughter, and all such<br />\nThings that mark life from mere<br />\nexistence?<br />\nVagrants\u2014shadows and shells of<br />\nmen!<br />\nNow brown, now green, as wave on<br />\nwave the wheat<br />\nRolled surging in the wind and broke<br />\nIn little rustlings on the lea,<br />\nSome flotsam leaves whirled on this<br />\nsea.<br /><br />\nFollow Arrow and you follow the style<br /><br />\nLuckies are less add<br />\nExcess of Acidity of Other Popular Brands Over LuckyStrike Cigarettes<br />\n0<br />\n0<br /><br />\nvice-versa on these matters.<br /><br />\n3<br /><br />\nBALANCE<br />\nLUCKY<br /><br />\nThere is thus none to relish the true colors of a Great Man. In general, we tend to look at our Great very much as the superstitious peas-<br /><br />\nI<br /><br />\nI<br /><br />\nSTRIKE<br /><br />\nants of the Middle Ages used to regard dragons, ogres, and elves. It was<br />\nimpossible for one of those peasants to conceive that an ogre might have<br /><br />\nBRAND<br /><br />\nB<br /><br />\nbladder trouble, just as much as he had.<br />\nThus I decided to write a series of short plays\u2014returning our Great<br />\nMen to the human fold (and when I say \"human\", I don't necessarily<br /><br />\nBRAND<br /><br />\nC<br /><br />\nBRAND<br /><br />\nD<br /><br />\nI<br /><br />\nmean that always as a compliment).<br />\nBut to humanize a Hitler demands an apology. For so far has the<br />\ncurrent hysteria advanced that I must go at length to argue that there<br />\nis really some reason for doing it. In brief, my reason is that the contemplation of remarkable human beings in their array of true colors is<br />\none of the great joys of life. In the midst of all the madness of murders<br />\nand glory, all of us can take a little time out and bring down the cutthroats from their horses with an Aristophanic roar. That is the end<br />\nof living. That roar of the intellect gives you faith in the riches of life,<br />\nwhatever your station\u2014and what else can now do a like service? It's<br />\nray of sunshine in an otherwise capitalistic world!<br />\nNow to unhorse a tyrant, you need little trite incidents. What would<br />\nhappen, I ask, if the common situations which are customary in theatrical plots happen to the world's mighty, just as to other matinee idols?<br />\nBut here's the problem. It is next to impossible to discover such<br />\nmortal incidents in the real life of our present dictators. They're all wellhidden. As all our tyrants have risen democratically and unheralded,<br />\nthere was no biographer to catch them in their obscurity\u2014as was the<br />\ncase in the absurd, but recorded rise of the third Napoleon. Such mortal<br />\nyouths are known only to the tyrants themselves, for obviously it's bad<br />\nbusiness to expose such facts and thus establish blood kinship to one's<br />\nvery humblest subject.<br />\nNow I don't really know what bits of scarlet color, Hoover, Hitler,<br />\nand Stalin have. Therefore, I am inventing bits for them. And that, as<br />\nyou know, amounts to libel!<br />\nBut a libel is unethical, you say. And from one point of view, I suppose it is. But let us remember the loftiness of our aim. We are libeling<br />\nas the only method of making human our fellow creatures of Earth.<br />\nThe Greeks\u2014Aristophanes--used it. Why can't we in the good old U. S.<br />\nA.? There's plenty of immorality in American business tactics. So,<br />\nwhy can't there be just a little in American letters? To the officials who<br />\nhave already banned an Elmer Rice portrayal of the Great Men of the<br />\nworld, I say, gentlemen, let's play the game. Writers will stop picking<br />\non crooked Babbitts, if the latter stop on crooked literati.<br />\nI have now almost completed three plays in the technique above discussed. The portraits are as lifelike as the facts permit. Whether I have<br />\nbeen successful remains to be seen. But I am convinced that the libel is<br />\n\u2014and rightly so\u2014a brilliant literary tool. What with Walter Winchell<br />\net al, it really should need no introduction in the United States. What it<br />\nneeds is universal application to the bogies that are now causing so<br />\nso much hysteria.<br />\n(A libelous Hitler play will appear in a forthcoming issue.)<br /><br />\n0<br />\ne\u2022<br />\n-a<br />\n\u2022<br /><br />\n\u2022<br /><br />\n1\u20223<br />\nCl<br />\n\u2022<br /><br />\nI<br /><br />\nI<br /><br />\n1<br /><br />\nSTANDARDIZED<br />\nUNIFORMITY<br />\n..,i.DUKE OF KENT\u2014A new,widespread collar on Arrow Shirts<br />\nin exclusive patterns\u2014candyiii.i::.:*.<br />\n\u2022 stripes on colored grounds.<br />\nSanforized-shrunk . . $<br />\n\u2022<br /><br />\nOnly Arrow Shirts have Arrow Collars<br /><br />\nROYAL OPINION<br />\nIs Good Enough for Us.<br />\nARROW SHIRTS<br />\nIn Exclusive Patterns<br /><br />\nMC PHERSON'S<br />\n11 East Baltimore Street<br /><br />\nThe simple mechanical details of cigarette<br />\nmanufacture are of surprising importance.<br />\nUpon them depend the physical properties<br />\nof the cigarette, such as weight, size, firmness, moisture-holding properties, uniformity<br />\nof fill\u2014uniformity of product\u2014all of which<br />\nhave a far-reaching effect on the character<br />\nof its combustion and the constituents of<br />\nits smoke.<br />\nIn the manufacture of Lucky Strike Cigarenes all of these properties have been<br />\nstandardized with care for the perfection of<br />\nA LIGHT SMOKE.<br /><br />\n\u2022<br /><br />\nLUCKIES ARE LESS ACID!<br />\nRecent chemical tests show* that other<br />\npopular brands have an excess of acidity over Lucky Strike of from 53\".; to 10O.<br /><br />\n*RESULTS VERIFIED BY INDEPENDENT CHEMICAL<br />\nLABORATORIES AND RESEARCH GROUPS<br /><br />\n\"IT'S TOASTED\"\u2014 Your throat protection<br />\nagainst irritation against cough<br />\nCopyright 1936, The American Tobacco Company<br /><br />\nBirely's Pharmacy<br />\nST.

My name<br /><br />\n\u2022\u2022\u2022<br /><br />\nRachel: Well you see, my dear,<br />\nGordon\u2014like every one else\u2014has<br />\ntwo sides to him. You satisfy one<br />\nside, and I the other.<br />\nMilly: Oh, I see\u2014the difference between love and friendship.<br />\nRachel: No, it's not that. There always will be something between us<br />\nstronger than just\u2014friendship.<br />\nDoctor (Coming in): All right, you<br />\ncan see him now for just a minute.<br />\n(As Rachel gets up.) No, not you,<br />\nMiss Tudor. I'm sorry, but we can't<br />\nlet him have any added excitement<br />\njust now.<br />\nDoctor (to Milly): Didn't you say<br />\nyour first name was Milly?<br />\nMilly (Excited): Yes.<br />\nDoctor: He's been calling for you<br />\nall the time he was delirious. The<br />\nnurse says he kept moaning and<br />\ntalking, and crying, \"Milly! Milly!\"<br />\nI think it will quiet him if he can<br />\nsee you for a little while.<br />\n(Milly is starting to cry, so<br />\nshe just nods.)<br />\nNurse (Coming in): Here are your<br />\nflowers, Miss Tudor. Don't they look<br />\npretty? I'm going to take them in<br />\nto him now.<br />\nMilly: Let me take them to him.<br />\nRachel: But I wanted . . . (generously, with a sigh): Oh, all right.<br />\nNurse: Well, I never! Why, Miss<br />\nTudor, how can you\u2014<br />\n(Rachel signs to her to keep<br />\nquiet.)<br />\nDoctor: Remember now\u2014don't do<br />\nanything to upset him. He's in a<br />\nvery dangerous condition.<br />\nMilly: No, I won't.<br />\n(She is dazed. She stands there<br />\nfor a moment\u2014a lovely picture.<br />\nThen she breaks away and goes<br />\ndown the hall.)<br />\nNurse: Well! I never did see such<br />\na selfish, thoughtless\u2014<br />\nRachel: Oh, it's all right. It doesn't<br />\nmake any difference \u2014 just so he<br />\ngets them.<br /><br />\nDoctor: I hope you understand,<br />\nMiss Tudor. He really ought not to<br />\nsee anybody right now, but I thought<br />\nit was best to let him see her\u2014just<br />\nto ease his mind a little.<br />\nRachel: Yes, I understand.<br />\n(Exit Doctor.)<br />\nNurse (Awkwardly coming over to<br />\nRachel): Poor dear, you don't look<br />\nwell\u2014not a bit. What you need is<br />\nsome rest\u2014staying here all day and<br />\nso late at night. And I can't make<br />\nyou eat a thing.<br />\nRachel (Lifelessly): Oh, I'm all<br />\nright.<br />\nNurse: He's what I'd call a finelooking man. Not handsome, you understand, but something that's a lot<br />\nmore important. He has an interesting face.<br />\nRachel: Yes, he is awfully attractive. I remember the first time I saw<br />\nhim \u2014<br />\nNurse: Ah, love at first sight?<br />\nRachel: No, not love\u2014that came<br />\nlater. But just recognition\u2014the recognition that we could mean so much<br />\nto each other.<br />\nNurse: And so you've gone tokether ever since.<br />\nRachel: Yes. At times, he's sort of<br />\nwandered off\u2014but he's always come<br />\nback to me. This time\u2014I'm not so<br />\nsure he will.<br />\nNurse: Don't you feel badly? When<br />\nhe gets well he'll know who's been<br />\nfaithful to him\u2014he'll know. Well . . .<br />\nI guess I've got to run along now.<br />\nRachel: Thank you. You've been so<br />\nkind to me.<br />\n(Exit nurse. Maly enters. She<br />\nseems changed\u2014more subdued.)<br />\nRachel: Well, how is he?<br />\nMilly: I think he's going to be all<br />\nright. He was quite conscious\u2014knew<br />\nme right away. But, oh\u2014it seems so<br />\nstrange, so wrong to see him lying<br />\nthere that way. He's so pale and<br />\nlistless\u2014not at all like he usually is.<br />\nRachel (Kindly): Was he happy<br />\nto see you?<br />\nMilly: Oh, yes\u2014very. He seemed<br />\ntired, though, so I wouldn't let him<br />\ntalk much, and he finally dropped<br />\noff to sleep with his head in my arms.,<br />\n(Rachel winces.)<br />\nRachel ,(Suddenly\u2014after a little<br />\npause): Milly, dear, you're not the<br />\none for Gordon.<br />\nMilly: I guess Gordon has the right<br /><br />\nto choose for himself, hasn't he?<br />\nRachel: You see, Gordon is essentially a one-woman man.<br />\nMilly: Yes, I think so, too. But\u2014<br />\nRachel: Milly, there's no reason for<br />\nus to be so opposed to each other<br />\nafter all, we both have the same<br />\nthing at heart--Cordon's happiness.<br />\nInstead of being jealous of each other, we ought to get together and try<br />\nto find the best way to make him<br />\nhappy.<br />\nMilly: You're a grand person, Rachel. Of course we will!<br />\nRachel: I think marriage is the<br />\nthing for Gordon. He has so much<br />\nenergy\u2014he could do so much if he<br />\nwere only guided in the right direction.<br />\n(There are excited voices in<br />\nthe halls.)<br />\n(Man's Voice: Quick! Get the<br />\noxygen tank.<br />\nWoman's Voice: Dr. Jenkins! Where<br />\nis Dr. Jenkins?<br />\nMan's Voice: Tell him to bring<br />\nit right away.<br />\nMan's Voice: Come here quickly!<br />\nMilly: Don't you think he's been<br />\nhappy lately?<br />\nRachel: No. I think he's torn between two lives\u2014the kind of man<br />\nhe'd be if he married you, and the<br />\nkind he'd be if he married me.<br />\nMilly: But he doesn't love you the<br />\nway he does me.<br />\nRachel: Perhaps not in the same<br />\nway\u2014although he used to. But we've<br />\ngotten beyond that stage. The novelty of our love has worn off, and<br />\nwe have instead a fine, clear understanding of each other.<br />\nMilly: You love him very much,<br />\ntoo, don't you?<br />\nRachel: Yes .. . Yes, I love him so<br />\nmuch that I would gladly get out of<br />\nhis life . . . if I could only be sure<br />\nthat you would be good for him.<br />\nMilly: And why not? We're both<br /><br />\nso crazy about each other\u2014<br />\nRachel: Yes, but will it last?<br />\nMilly: I'll always adore him.<br />\nRachel: How can you be sure?<br />\nYou're awfully young. He flatters<br />\nyou by his attentions, his boyish eagerness. But if you knew him as I<br />\ndo, I wonder if you'd feel the same?<br />\nMilly: I just can't imagine life<br />\nwithout him.<br />\nRachel: No, of course not\u2014not<br />\nnow. But by the time you're as old<br />\nas I am, you'll probably have changed<br />\nyour mind a couple of times.<br />\n(There is more hurrying in the<br />\nhalls.)<br />\nIf you let him get used to your<br />\naffection and then snatch it away<br />\nsuddenly, it would ruin him.<br />\nMilly: Oh, why can't we go on the<br />\nway we have been? Let him have<br />\nboth of us\u2014 or let's all three be<br />\nfriends..<br />\nRachel: No, dear, it just wouldn't<br />\nwork for Gordon. The only thing is<br />\nfor one of us to walk out of that door<br />\nand out of his life. I'll tell you what<br />\nwe'll do. Go sit down over there and<br />\nask yourself honestly if you are one<br />\nwho can do the most for him. I'll<br />\nsit here and think about it, too, and<br />\nif we agree .-. .<br />\n(Continued on Page 2, Col. 2)<br /><br />\nTHE NEW<br /><br />\nDENTISTRY<br />\nA Phase of Preventive Medicine<br />\nCollege Men find in it unusual<br />\nopportunities for a career<br />\nHARVARD UNIVERSITY<br /><br />\nDENTAL<br /><br />\nORTH CAPE<br />\nOLYMPIC GAMES<br />\n.earAtintf finetbriet4W(co-ED)<br />\n.<br />\n79<br /><br />\nSUMMER VOYAGE\u2022JULY 1st,1936<br />\n60 DAYS, FIRST CUSS,FROM $725<br />\nUNIVERSITY TRAVEL ASSOCIATION<br />\n30 ROCKEFELLER PLAZA, tiew York City<br /><br />\nUROPE<br />\nRUSSIA<br /><br />\nREE '-11.11113<br />\nOf each 25 passages bought<br />\nbefore April 15th \u2014 one, selected by lot, will be FREE<br />\n(raoncyrefunded).Bool:now<br />\n\u2014you may win free trip!
