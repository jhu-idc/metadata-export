The student newspaper, The Diamond.back, printed in its Sept. 25 issue an article about the Dean of<br />\nWomen receiving a traffic ticket, a picture of overcrowded<br />\nconditions, and another of the student government president<br />\nmissing a meeting. Dean of Men Gary Eppley, fearing its<br />\nimpression upon visiting high schoolers, seized the paper the<br />\nnext day and halted its distribution. Resultant publicity reached<br />\nnot only all visitors, but nearly all Baltimore as well, and papers<br />\nas far away as New York.<br />\nUniversity officials claimed that the articles were misrepresentations, and anyway, they were in poor taste. There was some<br />\ntruth in this, because the overcrowding was temporary, and the<br />\nstudent president arrived five minutes after the picture of his<br />\nempty chair was taken.<br />\nBut none of this justifies censorship or seizure. The University of Maryland publishes enough brochures extolling the<br />\nvirtues of the school.

Occasionally this very<br />\nthing happens, and no one is particularly happy with the result.<br />\nA further argument against fraternities which does not apply on<br />\nthis campus is the charge that an<br />\nindependent cannot get anywhere<br />\nIn extra curricular activities. The<br />\nstatistics would seem to disprove<br />\nthis claim, but its proof lies in<br />\nthe fact that relatively few independents go out for activities.<br />\nOne last qualification, is necessary. It should not be concluded<br />\nfrom the foregoing article that fraternities are the be all and end<br />\nall for every college student. There<br />\nare those who do not need that<br />\nwhich the fraternity has to offer,<br />\nand there are others who are incapable of fitting into any kind<br />\nof a close group. For these people<br />\nfraternities are out of the question. but that is no reason to condemn a system which works very<br />\nwell for a lot of people.<br /><br />\nL. G.
