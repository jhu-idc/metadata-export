It had<br />\nbeen granted a permit by the<br />\nBaltimore Zoning Board. That<br />\npermit was contested by the<br />\nImproveCanterbury-Tuscany<br />\nment Association, the matter<br />\nbeing taken to court.<br />\nOn the grounds that the renting of rooms, although not carried on by Phi Sigma Delta<br />\nfraternity for profit-making<br />\npurposes, is usually carried on<br />\nas a profit-making venture, the<br />\nfraternity did not meet the<br />\nspecifications required by the<br />\nzoning laws for multiple-dwelling units and Phi Sig lost the<br />\ncase. \u2022<br />\nNo Sleeping<br />\nThe zoning laws allow the Phi<br />\nSigs to eat and have parties in<br />\ntheir house; but they do not<br />\nmention anything about sleeping or living in the house. The<br />\ncourt, thereby, drew the inference that what was not mentioned, was not permitted. The<br />\nfraternity is appealing the case<br />\nto a higher court. As yet, the<br />\ncase hasn't been listed on that<br />\n<br />\ncourt's docket.<br />\nIn the meantime, an injunction was sought . by Phi Sig's<br />\nneighbors seeking to restrain<br />\nthe fraternity from using the<br />\nhouse until such time as a decision is made on the appeal.<br />\nThe order was granted.<br />\nTemporarily, Phi Sig has rented a house on 2908 Calvert<br />\nStreet which can sleep 10-15<br />\nboys.

They<br />\nhad heard of MAT before, but<br />\nbesides knowing that it is connected with the Education Department, most of them probably had no idea of what it is.<br />\nMAT stands for Master of Arts<br />\nin Teaching. It is a program<br />\ndesigned to provide graduates of<br />\nliberal arts colleges additional<br />\ntraining in their field and certification to teach in secondary<br />\nschools.<br />\nInstituted At Hopkins<br />\nIn an interview this week, Dr.<br />\nJohn Walton, Chairman of the<br />\nDepartment of Education and<br />\nDirector of the Master of Arts<br />\nin Teaching Program, outlined<br />\nthe history, scope and objectives<br />\nof the program.<br />\nAlthough the MAT program is<br />\nfairly new at Hopkins, having<br />\nbeen started in 1957; its history<br />\ngoes back to 1936 when Dr.<br />\nJames Conant, then the President of Harvard initiated an<br />\nMAT program at that university.<br />\nThe degree to be given was<br />\ndesignated as a Master' of Arts<br />\nin Teaching, rather than a Master of Arts degree because it is<br />\nnot a research degree as the<br />\nM.A. is, but rather a teaching<br />\ndegree.<br />\nThe program, however, did not<br />\nmeet with much success until<br />\nafter the Second World War. At<br />\nthat time the Ford Foundation<br />\nbecame interested in it.<br />\nProgram Widespread<br />\nWith the Ford Foundation<br />\nsupplying the Funds<br />\n-, similar<br />\nprograms were started at other<br />\nuniversities. The number of universities that presently have<br />\nMAT - prOgrams is over thirty,<br />\nwith such institutions as Harvard, Yale, Duke, Brown and<br />\nChicago included.<br />\nIn 1957 with the aid of a<br />\ngrant of $275,000 from the Fund<br />\nfor the Advancement of Education, Johns Hopkins initiated an<br />\nMAT program.<br />\nIn 1959 an additional sum of<br />\n$841,000 was granted to continue<br />\nthe program for seven years beyond the original three.<br />\n<br />\nFull Responsibilities<br />\nThe MAT students, on the<br />\nother hand, assume the responsibilities and duties of a fulltime teacher. They teach without any supervision and in most<br />\ncases have a full schedule of<br />\nclasses. In addition they perform other functions of a regular teacher including coaching<br />\nand attending PTA meetings.<br />\nIn the High School Journal of<br />\nFebruary, 1960, an article appeared by Dr. Walton titled<br />\n\"The Scholar-Teacher\" in which<br />\nhe set forth the purpose of the<br />\nMAT program.<br />\nIn this article Dr. Walton<br />\nstated that among other reforms<br />\nneeded in our secondary schools<br />\niS \"the recruil ment of more<br />\nteachers with continuing intellectual interests.<br />\n\"The fallacy in teacher education had been the aSsumption<br />\nthat every teacher should be a<br />\nspecialist or a scholar in Education. The high schools need a<br />\ncorps of scholars \u2014 linguists,<br />\nmathematicians, historians, biologists, physicists \u2014 who are<br />\ncompetent in the techniques of<br />\nteaching, but who continue to<br />\nbe primarily interested in their<br />\nsubject matter.\"<br />\n<br />\nRushing is over\u2014at least the first three weeks of<br />\nit, and while the feelings of the fraternities range all<br />\nover creation as to what should be done about next year,<br />\n(which, Incidently, are the exact same feelings they had<br />\nOne of the mystery spots of<br />\nlast year) it behooves the Greeks to look at the figures.<br />\nfrosh<br />\na<br />\nfrathe<br />\ninitially<br />\npledged<br />\nof<br />\nthe<br />\n45%<br />\nyear<br />\nUniversity is the tunnel<br />\nLast<br />\nternity, and while a small number were picked up in open under Gilman Hall, extending<br />\nrushing, this was a bit balanced by those who depledged. from one side of the campus to<br />\nThis year 44% of the freshman class began pledging the other. During the earlier<br />\nlast Saturday. However, the big difference, and what you years of the University, around<br />\nmight call the proof of the pudding, is that at least 8%, 1916, this tunnel was the only<br />\nconnection between the<br />\nor some 30 to 35 boys, will be or have been unofficially existing<br />\nnorth and south sides of the<br />\npicked up. Everyone began to realize the importance open campus. When Gilman was first<br />\nrushing would have this year, and perhaps the IFC has constructed, the tunnel not only<br />\nfinally reached the happy medium\u2014whereby the normal provided a thoroughfare for<br />\nper cent of frosh (those who have generally made up their students and faculty, but it also<br />\nmind) pledge on Pledge Day, and almost one quarter more furnished the only available<br />\nparking facilities for on campus<br />\nfrosh, who are unsure, wait an additional week, and then vehicles, as there were twelve<br />\npledge, bringing the grand total to over 50%.<br />\nparking cells along the walls.<br />\nThere is no getting away from the fact that despite The tunnel was then shut down<br />\nthe shortening and intensifying of the rush program, as with the coming of the war and<br />\nre-opened at its conclusion.<br />\na whole the fraternities did better than before.<br />\nStorage Area<br />\nAs to whether too many snap decisions have been<br />\nthe<br />\nWittproposed construcmade, and depledging may occur, we feel that a snap detion of Ames Hall came the<br />\ncision after three weeks is the same as a snap decision necessity<br />\nfoi 2 .torage area for<br />\nafter six. Admittedly, the frosh had ample time to see the construction inattrils.

Ames<br />\nHall, the tunnel was once again<br />\nre-opened for student use.<br />\nAt about this time, however,<br />\nautomobile traffic began to increase tremendously, creating a<br />\nhazardous condition for those<br />\npedestrians using the tunnel. To<br />\nadd to this problem, cars .were<br />\nbeginning to increase in width,<br />\nmaking it nearly impossible for<br />\ntwo of them to pass through the<br />\ntunnel simultaneously. Therefore, it was decided that the<br />\ntunnel should be closed for student use permanently so that<br />\nall of these hazards might be<br />\neliminated.<br />\nWaterproofed<br />\nThe tunnel was then completely waterproofed and has<br />\nbeen used since for many purposes. Among these uses are included a storage place for the<br />\nA.C. transformers for the building, storerooms for the Hopkins<br />\nPress and the bookstore, and<br />\nstorage facilities for surplus<br />\nequipment and materials.

The magazine, through its campus representative, has threatened to bring suit if the promoters of the<br />\ndance go through with their former plans to raffle off a<br />\nyoung lady.<br />\nPerhaps there is a legal point involved in this case<br />\nwhereby the magazine has good cause to sue; perhaps the<br />\npromoters are doing things they weren't authorized to<br />\ndo. We'll let the judge\u2014if suit is brought\u2014decide that.<br />\nBut our decision is that the whole matter is pretty<br />\nridiculous. We can't see how Playboy can question anyone<br />\nelse's good taste; and we certainly 'don't see how the<br />\nraffling off of Miss Vickers would in any way, shape, or<br />\nform, injure the good name of that worthy publication<br />\n(so well-known for\u2022 its \"pent-house parties,\" and elite<br />\n\"private clubs\").<br />\n<br />\nCareful Thinking<br />\nThe air has cleared, feelings have calmed down a bit,<br />\ngrumblings are down to a dull roar. Still, the DSRC and<br />\nits problems remain but we think that a second glance, and<br />\na fresh outlook are in order.<br />\nThe situation at the dorms is one that should provoke<br />\na bit of careful thinking, and less 'standing up and shouting for one's rights.' And this thinking should be on the<br />\npart of the students. If you want the lack of rules, the<br />\nfree 'traditional' atmosphere, the good representation, the<br />\nfine reputation, and the help and guidance (when you<br />\nask for it) of the men on the faculty who take an interest<br />\nin you; if you want all this, then begin filling your shoes<br />\nWith responsibility- and maturity.<br />\nIf the majority of you feel that thinffs are not as they<br />\nshould be, and such could very well be the case, then stop<br />\ncomplaining and grumbling and begin some action. Choose<br />\nnew and more capable leaders, if necessary; outline to<br />\nDr. Morrill what yon feel are the real problems, and what<br />\nyou would like him to do about it; and especially clamp<br />\ndown on the 10 or 15% of the boys in each entry who cause<br />\nall the damage, the noise, and the trouble, and spoil the<br />\nfreedoms for everyone else.<br />\nPerhaps in these ways, and with more careful thinking and acting, will you tactfully arrive at the dorm atmosphere that you are seeking.<br />\n<br />\nIs Everybcdy Happy?<br />\n<br />\nThe twelve month MAT program is broken down into three<br />\nphases:<br />\nThe student spends the summer months taking pedagogical<br />\ncourses such as educational<br />\npsychology, and principles of<br />\nsecondary school teaching.<br />\n\u2022 One semester of the academic<br />\nyear is devoted to taking courses<br />\nin the student's field.

I would call<br />\nMr. Henderson's position the<br />\n\"suppression-of-vice\" approach,<br />\nwhile the view represented by the<br />\neditors might be called \"social<br />\ngospel-humanitarian.\" The former has traditionally sought<br />\nthe eradication of individual<br />\n\"evils\"\u2014liquor, dancing, etc.; the<br />\nlatter has tended to emphasize<br />\nsocial reforms\u2014e.g. amelioration<br />\nof labor conditions and civil<br />\nrights \u2014 which are looked upon<br />\nas steps to the achievement of<br />\nthe good society.<br />\nTheoretically, one might expect that these are but two sides<br />\nof the same coin, whereas, in<br />\npractice, they have too often<br />\nbeen antithetical. A classic case<br />\nwas the 1899 crusade of the<br />\nevangelist, Sam Jones, to oust<br />\nhis namesake, the celebrated social<br />\nreform<br />\nmayor,<br />\nSam<br />\n\"Golden-Rule\" Jones, from office in Toledo largely because of<br />\nthe latter's \"lax\" views on temperance.<br />\nI do not wish to misinterpret<br />\nMr. Henderson's position, but the<br />\ntenor of his letter suggests to me<br />\nthat he may not possess much<br />\nenthusiasm for consicous efforts<br />\nat reform of the social order.<br />\nNeither is my point to take issue<br />\nwith the writer's objections to<br />\nPlayboy, nor to question the extent to which it may or may not<br />\nconstitute a menace to society.<br />\nHowever, it does seem a mistake<br />\nto disparage \"the role of crusading idealists\" who \"go out of<br />\ntheir way to take action in the<br />\nmatter of racial prejudice,\" even<br />\nif one does not himself feel<br />\ncommitted to participate actively in a given enterprise.<br />\nRaymond J.

It had<br />\nbeen granted a permit by the<br />\nBaltimore Zoning Board. That<br />\npermit was contested by the<br />\nImproveCanterbury-Tuscany<br />\nment Association, the matter<br />\nbeing taken to court.<br />\nOn the grounds that the renting of rooms, although not carried on by Phi Sigma Delta<br />\nfraternity for profit-making<br />\npurposes, is usually carried on<br />\nas a profit-making venture, the<br />\nfraternity did not meet the<br />\nspecifications required by the<br />\nzoning laws for multiple-dwelling units and Phi Sig lost the<br />\ncase. \u2022<br />\nNo Sleeping<br />\nThe zoning laws allow the Phi<br />\nSigs to eat and have parties in<br />\ntheir house; but they do not<br />\nmention anything about sleeping or living in the house.

They<br />\nhad heard of MAT before, but<br />\nbesides knowing that it is connected with the Education Department, most of them probably had no idea of what it is.<br />\nMAT stands for Master of Arts<br />\nin Teaching. It is a program<br />\ndesigned to provide graduates of<br />\nliberal arts colleges additional<br />\ntraining in their field and certification to teach in secondary<br />\nschools.<br />\nInstituted At Hopkins<br />\nIn an interview this week, Dr.<br />\nJohn Walton, Chairman of the<br />\nDepartment of Education and<br />\nDirector of the Master of Arts<br />\nin Teaching Program, outlined<br />\nthe history, scope and objectives<br />\nof the program.<br />\nAlthough the MAT program is<br />\nfairly new at Hopkins, having<br />\nbeen started in 1957; its history<br />\ngoes back to 1936 when Dr.<br />\nJames Conant, then the President of Harvard initiated an<br />\nMAT program at that university.<br />\nThe degree to be given was<br />\ndesignated as a Master' of Arts<br />\nin Teaching, rather than a Master of Arts degree because it is<br />\nnot a research degree as the<br />\nM.A. is, but rather a teaching<br />\ndegree.<br />\nThe program, however, did not<br />\nmeet with much success until<br />\nafter the Second World War. At<br />\nthat time the Ford Foundation<br />\nbecame interested in it.<br />\nProgram Widespread<br />\nWith the Ford Foundation<br />\nsupplying the Funds<br />\n-, similar<br />\nprograms were started at other<br />\nuniversities. The number of universities that presently have<br />\nMAT - prOgrams is over thirty,<br />\nwith such institutions as Harvard, Yale, Duke, Brown and<br />\nChicago included.<br />\nIn 1957 with the aid of a<br />\ngrant of $275,000 from the Fund<br />\nfor the Advancement of Education, Johns Hopkins initiated an<br />\nMAT program.<br />\nIn 1959 an additional sum of<br />\n$841,000 was granted to continue<br />\nthe program for seven years beyond the original three.<br /><br />\nFull Responsibilities<br />\nThe MAT students, on the<br />\nother hand, assume the responsibilities and duties of a fulltime teacher. They teach without any supervision and in most<br />\ncases have a full schedule of<br />\nclasses. In addition they perform other functions of a regular teacher including coaching<br />\nand attending PTA meetings.<br />\nIn the High School Journal of<br />\nFebruary, 1960, an article appeared by Dr. Walton titled<br />\n\"The Scholar-Teacher\" in which<br />\nhe set forth the purpose of the<br />\nMAT program.<br />\nIn this article Dr. Walton<br />\nstated that among other reforms<br />\nneeded in our secondary schools<br />\niS \"the recruil ment of more<br />\nteachers with continuing intellectual interests.<br />\n\"The fallacy in teacher education had been the aSsumption<br />\nthat every teacher should be a<br />\nspecialist or a scholar in Education. The high schools need a<br />\ncorps of scholars \u2014 linguists,<br />\nmathematicians, historians, biologists, physicists \u2014 who are<br />\ncompetent in the techniques of<br />\nteaching, but who continue to<br />\nbe primarily interested in their<br />\nsubject matter.\"<br /><br />\nRushing is over\u2014at least the first three weeks of<br />\nit, and while the feelings of the fraternities range all<br />\nover creation as to what should be done about next year,<br />\n(which, Incidently, are the exact same feelings they had<br />\nOne of the mystery spots of<br />\nlast year) it behooves the Greeks to look at the figures.<br />\nfrosh<br />\na<br />\nfrathe<br />\ninitially<br />\npledged<br />\nof<br />\nthe<br />\n45%<br />\nyear<br />\nUniversity is the tunnel<br />\nLast<br />\nternity, and while a small number were picked up in open under Gilman Hall, extending<br />\nrushing, this was a bit balanced by those who depledged. from one side of the campus to<br />\nThis year 44% of the freshman class began pledging the other.

However, the big difference, and what you years of the University, around<br />\nmight call the proof of the pudding, is that at least 8%, 1916, this tunnel was the only<br />\nconnection between the<br />\nor some 30 to 35 boys, will be or have been unofficially existing<br />\nnorth and south sides of the<br />\npicked up.

When Gilman was first<br />\nrushing would have this year, and perhaps the IFC has constructed, the tunnel not only<br />\nfinally reached the happy medium\u2014whereby the normal provided a thoroughfare for<br />\nper cent of frosh (those who have generally made up their students and faculty, but it also<br />\nmind) pledge on Pledge Day, and almost one quarter more furnished the only available<br />\nparking facilities for on campus<br />\nfrosh, who are unsure, wait an additional week, and then vehicles, as there were twelve<br />\npledge, bringing the grand total to over 50%.<br />\nparking cells along the walls.<br />\nThere is no getting away from the fact that despite The tunnel was then shut down<br />\nthe shortening and intensifying of the rush program, as with the coming of the war and<br />\nre-opened at its conclusion.<br />\na whole the fraternities did better than before.<br />\nStorage Area<br />\nAs to whether too many snap decisions have been<br />\nthe<br />\nWittproposed construcmade, and depledging may occur, we feel that a snap detion of Ames Hall came the<br />\ncision after three weeks is the same as a snap decision necessity<br />\nfoi 2 .torage area for<br />\nafter six.

To<br />\nadd to this problem, cars .were<br />\nbeginning to increase in width,<br />\nmaking it nearly impossible for<br />\ntwo of them to pass through the<br />\ntunnel simultaneously. Therefore, it was decided that the<br />\ntunnel should be closed for student use permanently so that<br />\nall of these hazards might be<br />\neliminated.<br />\nWaterproofed<br />\nThe tunnel was then completely waterproofed and has<br />\nbeen used since for many purposes.

The magazine, through its campus representative, has threatened to bring suit if the promoters of the<br />\ndance go through with their former plans to raffle off a<br />\nyoung lady.<br />\nPerhaps there is a legal point involved in this case<br />\nwhereby the magazine has good cause to sue; perhaps the<br />\npromoters are doing things they weren't authorized to<br />\ndo. We'll let the judge\u2014if suit is brought\u2014decide that.<br />\nBut our decision is that the whole matter is pretty<br />\nridiculous. We can't see how Playboy can question anyone<br />\nelse's good taste; and we certainly 'don't see how the<br />\nraffling off of Miss Vickers would in any way, shape, or<br />\nform, injure the good name of that worthy publication<br />\n(so well-known for\u2022 its \"pent-house parties,\" and elite<br />\n\"private clubs\").<br /><br />\nCareful Thinking<br />\nThe air has cleared, feelings have calmed down a bit,<br />\ngrumblings are down to a dull roar. Still, the DSRC and<br />\nits problems remain but we think that a second glance, and<br />\na fresh outlook are in order.<br />\nThe situation at the dorms is one that should provoke<br />\na bit of careful thinking, and less 'standing up and shouting for one's rights.' And this thinking should be on the<br />\npart of the students. If you want the lack of rules, the<br />\nfree 'traditional' atmosphere, the good representation, the<br />\nfine reputation, and the help and guidance (when you<br />\nask for it) of the men on the faculty who take an interest<br />\nin you; if you want all this, then begin filling your shoes<br />\nWith responsibility- and maturity.<br />\nIf the majority of you feel that thinffs are not as they<br />\nshould be, and such could very well be the case, then stop<br />\ncomplaining and grumbling and begin some action. Choose<br />\nnew and more capable leaders, if necessary; outline to<br />\nDr. Morrill what yon feel are the real problems, and what<br />\nyou would like him to do about it; and especially clamp<br />\ndown on the 10 or 15% of the boys in each entry who cause<br />\nall the damage, the noise, and the trouble, and spoil the<br />\nfreedoms for everyone else.<br />\nPerhaps in these ways, and with more careful thinking and acting, will you tactfully arrive at the dorm atmosphere that you are seeking.<br /><br />\nIs Everybcdy Happy?<br /><br />\nThe twelve month MAT program is broken down into three<br />\nphases:<br />\nThe student spends the summer months taking pedagogical<br />\ncourses such as educational<br />\npsychology, and principles of<br />\nsecondary school teaching.<br />\n\u2022 One semester of the academic<br />\nyear is devoted to taking courses<br />\nin the student's field.

I would call<br />\nMr. Henderson's position the<br />\n\"suppression-of-vice\" approach,<br />\nwhile the view represented by the<br />\neditors might be called \"social<br />\ngospel-humanitarian.\" The former has traditionally sought<br />\nthe eradication of individual<br />\n\"evils\"\u2014liquor, dancing, etc.; the<br />\nlatter has tended to emphasize<br />\nsocial reforms\u2014e.g. amelioration<br />\nof labor conditions and civil<br />\nrights \u2014 which are looked upon<br />\nas steps to the achievement of<br />\nthe good society.<br />\nTheoretically, one might expect that these are but two sides<br />\nof the same coin, whereas, in<br />\npractice, they have too often<br />\nbeen antithetical. A classic case<br />\nwas the 1899 crusade of the<br />\nevangelist, Sam Jones, to oust<br />\nhis namesake, the celebrated social<br />\nreform<br />\nmayor,<br />\nSam<br />\n\"Golden-Rule\" Jones, from office in Toledo largely because of<br />\nthe latter's \"lax\" views on temperance.<br />\nI do not wish to misinterpret<br />\nMr. Henderson's position, but the<br />\ntenor of his letter suggests to me<br />\nthat he may not possess much<br />\nenthusiasm for consicous efforts<br />\nat reform of the social order.<br />\nNeither is my point to take issue<br />\nwith the writer's objections to<br />\nPlayboy, nor to question the extent to which it may or may not<br />\nconstitute a menace to society.<br />\nHowever, it does seem a mistake<br />\nto disparage \"the role of crusading idealists\" who \"go out of<br />\ntheir way to take action in the<br />\nmatter of racial prejudice,\" even<br />\nif one does not himself feel<br />\ncommitted to participate actively in a given enterprise.<br />\nRaymond J.
