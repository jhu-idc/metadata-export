A.A. Champion.<br />\n<br />\n\"Eddie\" Hooper, coach of the<br />\n'Varsity baseball team, has signed<br />\na one-year contract with the Pittsburgh team of the Federal League.<br />\nThe position, however, will interfere in no manner with his connection with Hopkins, for he will<br />\nnot join the Smoky City team until<br />\nhe has whipped the Hopkins nine<br />\ninto shape and piloted it through<br />\nits schedule.<br />\nCoach Hooper was formerly a<br />\nmember of the York (Tri-State)<br />\nteam and last season was one of<br />\nits most sensational fielders. He<br />\nwas a player on the Baltimore<br />\nOrioles before going to York. While<br />\non the local team, however, he had<br />\ncontinuous trouble with his arm,<br />\nwhich interfered with batting, and<br />\nhe was forced to retire to a league<br />\nwhere he would not be required<br />\nto play so strenuously.<br />\nNearly a month ago friends of<br />\nCoach Hooper learned that the<br />\n\"Feds\" were flirting with him.<br />\nFirst came the rumor that the<br />\nIndianapolis team wanted him, but<br />\nlater it developed that Pittsburgh<br />\nhad taken a fancy to his excellent<br />\nrecord as a fielder for York. The<br />\noffer came to Coach Hooper, but<br />\nhe said nothing about it to his Hopkins charges. He considered the<br />\n\u2022<br />\n`jump\"<br />\nfor some time, and finally<br />\ndecided to sign the Pittsburgh contract.<br />\nIt will not be necessary, however,<br />\nfor him to leave the Hopkins team<br />\nuntil its season is closed. Even<br />\nwhile a member of the York team<br />\nhe went through nearly the whole<br />\nHopkins season before reporting<br />\nto his own team, and as the Teds\"<br />\nwill not organize until late in the<br />\nyear, he will possibly be able to be<br />\nwith the 'Varsity the entire season<br />\nthis year before leaving.<br />\nThe contract signed with Pittsburgh calls for one year's service,<br />\nand the salary is a great deal more<br />\nattractive than that of York. Coach<br />\nHooper will be playing in company<br />\nwith some of the big stars of the<br />\nAmericah national game, and if current reports are to be believed, he<br />\nwill face the pitching of \"Christy\"<br />\nMathewson, the Giant, who is said<br />\n- to have been landed by a \"Fed\"<br />\nteam.<br />\nCoach Hooper has had charge of<br />\nthree Hopkins nines. He coached<br />\nthe last year's squad, and in 1912<br />\nhe coached the first baseball team<br />\nofficially recognized as representing the University.<br />\n<br />\nThrough the action of the Board<br />\nof Collegiate Studies in changing<br />\nits policy toward hazing, the Student Council has been given \u2022 the<br />\nauthority to proceed with its plans<br />\nin dealing with interclass rivalry.<br />\nThe Board and Council have had<br />\nseveral joint meetings for a discussion of the topic, and because of<br />\nthe arbitrariness and the absence<br />\nof allowance for extraordinary circumstances in the faculty's hazing<br />\nrule, it was decided to repeal it.<br />\nThe rule, as stated in the front of<br />\nthe course record book, is: \"A student shall be liable to immediate<br />\ndismissal who shall, in any way, be<br />\nan actor or a participant in hazing<br />\nor interfering with class banquets,<br />\nor shall engage, in the gymnasium<br />\nor in any of the University buildings, in any form of hazing.\"<br />\nThe inability to enforce this rule,<br />\nas evinced in recent occurrences,<br />\ncoupled with its doubtful fairness<br />\nand the fact that the Student Council could undertake no revision of<br />\nhazing while it existed, argued for<br />\nits repeal from the regulations. The<br />\nrepeal, however, does not indicate<br />\nthat the faculty will tolerate hazing. The Board has simply adopted<br />\na new policy which is explained in<br />\nthe following letter:<br />\nMR. H. E. CORNER,<br />\nChairman Student Council.<br />\nMY DEAR MR. CORNER:<br />\nI am instructed, as secretary pro<br />\nternpore of the Board of the College Studies, to inform you that the<br />\nrecommendations of the joint meeting of the Committee of the Faculty and the Student Council have<br />\nbeen adopted by the Board. These<br />\nrecommendations, you will remember, included the appointment by<br />\nthe Board of a standing committee<br />\non student affairs and the general<br />\npolicy of naming no specific penalty<br />\nfor breaches of good order; but<br />\nshould any occur, of dealing with<br />\neach case on its merits.<br />\nYours very truly,<br />\nJOHN C. FRENCH.<br />\nFebruary 27, 1914.<br />\nThe collegiate Board also granted<br />\nthe request of the Student Council<br />\nto have a printed form in all examination books in which the student could write his pledge.<br />\nProgress has been made in both<br />\nof the two plans considered by the<br />\nCouncil for the changes in hazing.<br />\nPresident Thompson, of the freshman class, has appointed a committees which will frame \"freshman<br />\nregulations.\"<br />\n<br />\nMcCoy Hall will be the scene<br />\nnext Friday night of one of the<br />\nmost interesting of our annual affairs. The junior and senior classes<br />\nwill, through their representatives,<br />\ncontest for the Adams Trophy, and<br />\nselected speakers from the sophomore class will try for the Adams<br />\nMedal. Members of three classes<br />\nwill, therefore, be interested in the<br />\nevent, and freshmen will doubtless<br />\nalso be inquisitive enough to wish<br />\nto attend. Cards of admission can<br />\nbe obtained from any one of the<br />\nInvitation Committee. There will<br />\nprobably be some music by the<br />\nGlee or Instrumental Club to fill<br />\nout the program.<br />\nThe oratorical contest will come<br />\nfirst on the program. Tingley,<br />\nWebb-Peploe and Cohn will be the<br />\ncontestants. The judges of this<br />\ncontest and also of the debate have<br />\nnot been finally decided upon. In<br />\nthe debate, the juniors will fire the<br />\nfirst shot in favor of abandonment<br />\nof the Monroe Doctrine. They will<br />\nspeak in the following order: Bartlett, Eiseman and Weech. The<br />\nseniors will uphold the negative<br />\nand speak as follows: Lauchheimer,<br />\nWeber and White. Each side will<br />\nhave two twelve-minute speeches<br />\nof argument and then ten minutes<br />\nof rebuttal. The winning side will<br />\ncontribute to the collection of tablets at the south end of the corridor on the second floor of McCoy<br />\nHall.<br />\nIt is difficult to prophesy which<br />\nside will be victorious. For a number of years the junior class has<br />\ncome off victorious. The present<br />\nsenior class has seen three successive junior victories, including its<br />\nown, last year. If the seniors<br />\nshould win this year, they will be<br />\nthe first in a long time to have won<br />\nboth of the debates. This year's<br />\njunior team has a majority of experienced speakers, while only one<br />\nof the seniors has been heard here<br />\nbefore.<br />\nWithin a week or so after this<br />\ndebate, the try-outs will be held for<br />\nthe more important intercollegiate<br />\ncontest which will be held on the<br />\nnight of Saturday, April 18. Hopkins will have two teams, one on<br />\neach side, the question being the<br />\nsame as that argued by the upper<br />\nclasses.. Places \u00b0I_ the intercollegiate teams are open not only to<br />\nmembers of the two class teams,<br />\nbut to other students as well. The<br />\nHopkins negative team will go to<br />\nCharlottesville, Va. and there meet<br />\nthe University of'<br />\nNorth Carolina,<br />\n<br />\n(Continued on page 8, col. 3)<br />\n<br />\n(Continued on page 8, col. 3)<br />\n<br />\nThe track team made a glorious<br />\nfinish for their indoor season by<br />\nwinning first honors last Saturday<br />\nnight in the annual Georgetown<br />\ngames, with a score of 22 points.<br />\nYale men were second, with 18<br />\npoints, and Georgetown came third<br />\nwith fo. Hopkins also won 14<br />\npoints which did not count in the<br />\nteam score-6 in novice events and<br />\n8 in S. A. A. Championships\u2014making a total of 36 points won by<br />\nthe Black and Blue.<br />\nThe meet opened with the 50yard dashes, in which Hopkins<br />\nfailed to show up strongly, Binford, with third place in the novice<br />\nevent, being the only man to place.<br />\nThe heavy scoring was begun by<br />\nthe field men, when Connolly won<br />\nfirst place in both Ihe open and<br />\nchampionship high jump, and Sturgis took second in the two shotputs. Connolly's jump in the .open<br />\nevent was 5 feet i i inches, and in<br />\nthe championships 5 feet To inches.<br />\nIn the other field event Hopkins<br />\nalso won honors, Tappan winning<br />\nthe pole-vault by the height of<br />\nfeet fo inches, including his handicap. This gave the Black and Blue<br />\n13 in the point score.<br />\nMelamet and Wells added eight<br />\npoints to this by capturing the first<br />\ntwo places in the open 44o-yard<br />\ndash. Melamet ran a beautiful<br />\nrace, and Wells finished close to<br />\nhim. The time was 523's seconds.<br />\nStill another point was brought<br />\nin to make up the total of 22, by<br />\nLloyd, who got third place in the<br />\nopen 880-yard run. Hopkins entered six men in this race, but<br />\nLloyd was the only man able to<br />\nbreak through the crowd and place.<br />\nCatlin made a good fight in both<br />\nthe half and the mile, but was unable to overcome the large handicaps. Binford also won the novice<br />\n600-yard dash, securing first in<br />\nboth his heat and the finals.<br />\nIt was the last meet of the very<br />\nsuccessful indoor season. The first<br />\ntwo meets were \"walk-aways\"; in<br />\nthe Armory meet all three of the<br />\nrelay teams were victorious; the<br />\nfollowing week the first relay men<br />\ndefeated Lehigh by a large margin, and this final triumph at<br />\n'the Georgetown games, with the<br />\nothers, points to bright prospects<br />\nfor the coming and more important<br />\noutdoor schedule. The men will<br />\nhave a few weeks rest now before<br />\nbeginning of the hard training for<br />\nthe first outdoor contest, which will<br />\nbe a dual meet with Navy on the<br />\nFriday after Easter.<br />\n<br />\n\f2<br />\n<br />\nTHE NEWS\u2014LETTER, MARCH 9, 1914.<br />\n<br />\nNOTICE<br />\n<br />\nPLEASED WITH THE PUBLIC SPIRIT<br />\n<br />\nTHE MUSICAL CLUBS FAIL AGAIN<br />\n<br />\nTrustees Talk of Cordial Reception That<br />\nIs Given Dr. Goodnow's Name.<br />\nHomewood Reports Read.<br />\n<br />\nConcert at Clifton Church a \"Fizzle,\" but<br />\nClubs Enthuse Inmates of Phipps<br />\nClinic\u2014Jack Fulton Stars.<br />\n<br />\nA revised alphabetical list of<br />\nadvertisers will be ready by the<br />\nlatter part of the week.

Masters Boyce, Pitt, Kohn,<br />\nDawson and Emanuel Gichner, the<br />\nlatter of Homewood fame, were the<br />\nunfortunate freshmen. Gichner was<br />\ncalled upon for a speech, and although not in his usual voice,<br />\nmanaged to say some things complimentary to 1916 in general, and<br />\nwith little more ado the five unfortunates were forcibly ejected<br />\nfrom the hall.<br />\nMyron Bagley was an accomplished toastmaster. The set speeches<br />\nwere:<br />\n\"The Class,\" Henry G. Rutledge.<br />\n\"The University,\" Hiram W.<br />\nWoodward.<br />\n\"Frau Sorge,\" Thomas Tingley.<br />\n\"Ma Greene,\" Dorsey Richardson.<br />\n\"To liven in delyt was ever his wone<br />\nFor he was epicurus owne sone.\"<br />\n\"The Northern Police Station,\"<br />\nSamuel L.

Rutledge, Woodward and Leitheiser stuck to prose,<br />\nand gave amusing and telling talks.<br />\nOf the informal speakers, John<br />\nKnipp drew forth great applause<br />\nwith what was described by one<br />\nauditor as a \"delightfully risque\"<br />\ndiscourse on \"One Day,\" a play<br />\nmuch admired by many in the class.<br />\nMcCormick, though unprepared,<br />\ndelivered a very clever oration on<br />\nthe Homewood affair. Penniman,<br />\nPrimrose and \"Rube\" Vickers spoke<br />\nin response to toasts, and Walter<br />\nWood proposed a clever class toast<br />\nin verse, which was received with<br />\nenthusiasm.<br />\nThe fact that some freshmen<br />\nwere brought in made everyone feel<br />\nthat the class had kept the upper<br />\nhand in the recent troubles, but<br />\ntheir presence was not allowed to<br />\ndisturb the orderly conduct of the<br />\nbanquet.

The work is to<br />\nbe of such a character as to meet<br />\nwith the approval of the .professors,<br />\nand each student will be required<br />\nto make a, report on the work he<br />\nhas done. Dr. Whitehead said that<br />\nthe faculty would assist in finding<br />\nthe employment, but advised that<br />\nanyone with \"pull\" should endeavor<br />\nto locate himself.<br />\nThe announcement of the policy<br />\nhad not before been officially made<br />\nto students in the engineering<br />\ncourses, although many knew that<br />\nsuch a plan had been decided upon.<br />\nDr. Whitehead was the speaker before the Engineering Society Monday, and took that occasion to announce the faculty's rule.<br />\nDr. Whitehead then spoke on<br />\n\"The New Nitrogen-Filled Tungsten Lamps.\" These new incandescent lamps have an efficiency of 20<br />\nper cent, as compared with the 2<br />\nper cent, of the ordinary carbon<br />\nlamps, and the 10 per cent. of the<br />\ntungsten lamps now in use. They<br />\nare manufactured by the General<br />\nElectric Company, and are soon to<br />\nbe put on the market.<br />\nTwo of the lamps were shown<br />\nand their brilliancy nearly dazzled<br />\nthe audience, as they were of about<br />\n1,500 candle-power each.<br />\nBefore lighting the lamps, Dr.<br />\nWhitehead gave a brief account of<br />\nthe discoveries which led to their<br />\nproduction. He also gave a detailed description of their construction, and explained that the reason<br />\nlighting apparatus was so inefficient<br />\nas compared with other electric apparatus was because so much.energy<br />\nwas lost in heat.<br />\nAfter the meeting, the speaker<br />\nsaid that there was a great field for<br />\nwork in lighting problems and that<br />\nhe thought that \"cold light\" would<br />\nultimately be produced.<br />\nDr. Whitehead's talk was much<br />\nenjoyed by the members, who gave<br />\nhim a vote of thanks at the close<br />\nof his address.<br />\n<br />\nThe Medical Standard Book Co.<br />\n307 N.

The last two concerts have been described as \"rotten\" and \"frosts.\"<br />\n' According to reports, the Clubs<br />\n\"held together\" during the season<br />\ncovering the Eastern Shore trip<br />\nand the McCoy Hall entertainment,<br />\nbut there has been a decided lack<br />\nof interest shown by the members<br />\nsince. The concert in Catonsville<br />\nwas poorly given because of the<br />\nabsence of a great many of the<br />\nsingers and players through reasons unexplained, and concerts at<br />\nlocal churches have been affected<br />\nthe same way. A poor showing<br />\nhas been made because of wholesale absence.<br />\nThe managers of the Clubs say<br />\nthe members are not showing the<br />\nproper spirit, and the members say<br />\nthe management is at fault because<br />\nit has-arranged too many concerts<br />\nafter the McCoy Hall one. It so<br />\nhappens that a great many of the<br />\nmembers are now interested in<br />\nother activities and find it difficult<br />\nto \"keep up this singing and playing all year.\"<br />\nThe situation is indeed an unwholesome one. Those members<br />\nwho have stuck loyally to the finish<br />\ndeserve thanks, but it must be<br />\nremembered that the Clubs are<br />\nnot representing Hopkins as they<br />\nshould. One more concert is to be<br />\ngiven\u2014that at Walbrook.

Even<br />\nwhile a member of the York team<br />\nhe went through nearly the whole<br />\nHopkins season before reporting<br />\nto his own team, and as the Teds\"<br />\nwill not organize until late in the<br />\nyear, he will possibly be able to be<br />\nwith the 'Varsity the entire season<br />\nthis year before leaving.<br />\nThe contract signed with Pittsburgh calls for one year's service,<br />\nand the salary is a great deal more<br />\nattractive than that of York. Coach<br />\nHooper will be playing in company<br />\nwith some of the big stars of the<br />\nAmericah national game, and if current reports are to be believed, he<br />\nwill face the pitching of \"Christy\"<br />\nMathewson, the Giant, who is said<br />\n- to have been landed by a \"Fed\"<br />\nteam.<br />\nCoach Hooper has had charge of<br />\nthree Hopkins nines. He coached<br />\nthe last year's squad, and in 1912<br />\nhe coached the first baseball team<br />\nofficially recognized as representing the University.<br /><br />\nThrough the action of the Board<br />\nof Collegiate Studies in changing<br />\nits policy toward hazing, the Student Council has been given \u2022 the<br />\nauthority to proceed with its plans<br />\nin dealing with interclass rivalry.<br />\nThe Board and Council have had<br />\nseveral joint meetings for a discussion of the topic, and because of<br />\nthe arbitrariness and the absence<br />\nof allowance for extraordinary circumstances in the faculty's hazing<br />\nrule, it was decided to repeal it.<br />\nThe rule, as stated in the front of<br />\nthe course record book, is: \"A student shall be liable to immediate<br />\ndismissal who shall, in any way, be<br />\nan actor or a participant in hazing<br />\nor interfering with class banquets,<br />\nor shall engage, in the gymnasium<br />\nor in any of the University buildings, in any form of hazing.\"<br />\nThe inability to enforce this rule,<br />\nas evinced in recent occurrences,<br />\ncoupled with its doubtful fairness<br />\nand the fact that the Student Council could undertake no revision of<br />\nhazing while it existed, argued for<br />\nits repeal from the regulations. The<br />\nrepeal, however, does not indicate<br />\nthat the faculty will tolerate hazing. The Board has simply adopted<br />\na new policy which is explained in<br />\nthe following letter:<br />\nMR. H. E. CORNER,<br />\nChairman Student Council.<br />\nMY DEAR MR. CORNER:<br />\nI am instructed, as secretary pro<br />\nternpore of the Board of the College Studies, to inform you that the<br />\nrecommendations of the joint meeting of the Committee of the Faculty and the Student Council have<br />\nbeen adopted by the Board. These<br />\nrecommendations, you will remember, included the appointment by<br />\nthe Board of a standing committee<br />\non student affairs and the general<br />\npolicy of naming no specific penalty<br />\nfor breaches of good order; but<br />\nshould any occur, of dealing with<br />\neach case on its merits.<br />\nYours very truly,<br />\nJOHN C. FRENCH.<br />\nFebruary 27, 1914.<br />\nThe collegiate Board also granted<br />\nthe request of the Student Council<br />\nto have a printed form in all examination books in which the student could write his pledge.<br />\nProgress has been made in both<br />\nof the two plans considered by the<br />\nCouncil for the changes in hazing.<br />\nPresident Thompson, of the freshman class, has appointed a committees which will frame \"freshman<br />\nregulations.\"<br /><br />\nMcCoy Hall will be the scene<br />\nnext Friday night of one of the<br />\nmost interesting of our annual affairs. The junior and senior classes<br />\nwill, through their representatives,<br />\ncontest for the Adams Trophy, and<br />\nselected speakers from the sophomore class will try for the Adams<br />\nMedal. Members of three classes<br />\nwill, therefore, be interested in the<br />\nevent, and freshmen will doubtless<br />\nalso be inquisitive enough to wish<br />\nto attend. Cards of admission can<br />\nbe obtained from any one of the<br />\nInvitation Committee. There will<br />\nprobably be some music by the<br />\nGlee or Instrumental Club to fill<br />\nout the program.<br />\nThe oratorical contest will come<br />\nfirst on the program. Tingley,<br />\nWebb-Peploe and Cohn will be the<br />\ncontestants. The judges of this<br />\ncontest and also of the debate have<br />\nnot been finally decided upon. In<br />\nthe debate, the juniors will fire the<br />\nfirst shot in favor of abandonment<br />\nof the Monroe Doctrine. They will<br />\nspeak in the following order: Bartlett, Eiseman and Weech. The<br />\nseniors will uphold the negative<br />\nand speak as follows: Lauchheimer,<br />\nWeber and White. Each side will<br />\nhave two twelve-minute speeches<br />\nof argument and then ten minutes<br />\nof rebuttal. The winning side will<br />\ncontribute to the collection of tablets at the south end of the corridor on the second floor of McCoy<br />\nHall.<br />\nIt is difficult to prophesy which<br />\nside will be victorious. For a number of years the junior class has<br />\ncome off victorious. The present<br />\nsenior class has seen three successive junior victories, including its<br />\nown, last year. If the seniors<br />\nshould win this year, they will be<br />\nthe first in a long time to have won<br />\nboth of the debates. This year's<br />\njunior team has a majority of experienced speakers, while only one<br />\nof the seniors has been heard here<br />\nbefore.<br />\nWithin a week or so after this<br />\ndebate, the try-outs will be held for<br />\nthe more important intercollegiate<br />\ncontest which will be held on the<br />\nnight of Saturday, April 18. Hopkins will have two teams, one on<br />\neach side, the question being the<br />\nsame as that argued by the upper<br />\nclasses.. Places \u00b0I_ the intercollegiate teams are open not only to<br />\nmembers of the two class teams,<br />\nbut to other students as well. The<br />\nHopkins negative team will go to<br />\nCharlottesville, Va. and there meet<br />\nthe University of'<br />\nNorth Carolina,<br /><br />\n(Continued on page 8, col. 3)<br /><br />\n(Continued on page 8, col. 3)<br /><br />\nThe track team made a glorious<br />\nfinish for their indoor season by<br />\nwinning first honors last Saturday<br />\nnight in the annual Georgetown<br />\ngames, with a score of 22 points.<br />\nYale men were second, with 18<br />\npoints, and Georgetown came third<br />\nwith fo. Hopkins also won 14<br />\npoints which did not count in the<br />\nteam score-6 in novice events and<br />\n8 in S. A. A. Championships\u2014making a total of 36 points won by<br />\nthe Black and Blue.<br />\nThe meet opened with the 50yard dashes, in which Hopkins<br />\nfailed to show up strongly, Binford, with third place in the novice<br />\nevent, being the only man to place.<br />\nThe heavy scoring was begun by<br />\nthe field men, when Connolly won<br />\nfirst place in both Ihe open and<br />\nchampionship high jump, and Sturgis took second in the two shotputs. Connolly's jump in the .open<br />\nevent was 5 feet i i inches, and in<br />\nthe championships 5 feet To inches.<br />\nIn the other field event Hopkins<br />\nalso won honors, Tappan winning<br />\nthe pole-vault by the height of<br />\nfeet fo inches, including his handicap. This gave the Black and Blue<br />\n13 in the point score.<br />\nMelamet and Wells added eight<br />\npoints to this by capturing the first<br />\ntwo places in the open 44o-yard<br />\ndash. Melamet ran a beautiful<br />\nrace, and Wells finished close to<br />\nhim. The time was 523's seconds.<br />\nStill another point was brought<br />\nin to make up the total of 22, by<br />\nLloyd, who got third place in the<br />\nopen 880-yard run. Hopkins entered six men in this race, but<br />\nLloyd was the only man able to<br />\nbreak through the crowd and place.<br />\nCatlin made a good fight in both<br />\nthe half and the mile, but was unable to overcome the large handicaps. Binford also won the novice<br />\n600-yard dash, securing first in<br />\nboth his heat and the finals.<br />\nIt was the last meet of the very<br />\nsuccessful indoor season. The first<br />\ntwo meets were \"walk-aways\"; in<br />\nthe Armory meet all three of the<br />\nrelay teams were victorious; the<br />\nfollowing week the first relay men<br />\ndefeated Lehigh by a large margin, and this final triumph at<br />\n'the Georgetown games, with the<br />\nothers, points to bright prospects<br />\nfor the coming and more important<br />\noutdoor schedule. The men will<br />\nhave a few weeks rest now before<br />\nbeginning of the hard training for<br />\nthe first outdoor contest, which will<br />\nbe a dual meet with Navy on the<br />\nFriday after Easter.<br /><br />\n2<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS\u2014LETTER, MARCH 9, 1914.<br /><br />\nNOTICE<br /><br />\nPLEASED WITH THE PUBLIC SPIRIT<br /><br />\nTHE MUSICAL CLUBS FAIL AGAIN<br /><br />\nTrustees Talk of Cordial Reception That<br />\nIs Given Dr. Goodnow's Name.<br />\nHomewood Reports Read.<br /><br />\nConcert at Clifton Church a \"Fizzle,\" but<br />\nClubs Enthuse Inmates of Phipps<br />\nClinic\u2014Jack Fulton Stars.<br /><br />\nA revised alphabetical list of<br />\nadvertisers will be ready by the<br />\nlatter part of the week.

Masters Boyce, Pitt, Kohn,<br />\nDawson and Emanuel Gichner, the<br />\nlatter of Homewood fame, were the<br />\nunfortunate freshmen. Gichner was<br />\ncalled upon for a speech, and although not in his usual voice,<br />\nmanaged to say some things complimentary to 1916 in general, and<br />\nwith little more ado the five unfortunates were forcibly ejected<br />\nfrom the hall.<br />\nMyron Bagley was an accomplished toastmaster. The set speeches<br />\nwere:<br />\n\"The Class,\" Henry G. Rutledge.<br />\n\"The University,\" Hiram W.<br />\nWoodward.<br />\n\"Frau Sorge,\" Thomas Tingley.<br />\n\"Ma Greene,\" Dorsey Richardson.<br />\n\"To liven in delyt was ever his wone<br />\nFor he was epicurus owne sone.\"<br />\n\"The Northern Police Station,\"<br />\nSamuel L. Leitheiser.<br />\nOf these, the distinct hit of the<br />\nevening was Tingley's parody of<br />\n\"Gunga Din,\" 'under the head of<br />\n\"Frau Sorge.\" In introducing him,<br />\nToastinaster Bagley stated that<br />\n\"Sorge\" was Hindustani for \"Griffin,\" and it was in this meaning that<br />\nTingley treated the word.<br />\nAnother poetical effort was Richardson's \"The Legende of a Goode<br />\nWoman,\" in the language and metre<br />\nused by Chaucer. Rutledge, Woodward and Leitheiser stuck to prose,<br />\nand gave amusing and telling talks.<br />\nOf the informal speakers, John<br />\nKnipp drew forth great applause<br />\nwith what was described by one<br />\nauditor as a \"delightfully risque\"<br />\ndiscourse on \"One Day,\" a play<br />\nmuch admired by many in the class.<br />\nMcCormick, though unprepared,<br />\ndelivered a very clever oration on<br />\nthe Homewood affair. Penniman,<br />\nPrimrose and \"Rube\" Vickers spoke<br />\nin response to toasts, and Walter<br />\nWood proposed a clever class toast<br />\nin verse, which was received with<br />\nenthusiasm.<br />\nThe fact that some freshmen<br />\nwere brought in made everyone feel<br />\nthat the class had kept the upper<br />\nhand in the recent troubles, but<br />\ntheir presence was not allowed to<br />\ndisturb the orderly conduct of the<br />\nbanquet. The menu card was illustrated with a flashlight photograph of the hazing party of November 10 last, taken before the<br />\nNorthern Police Station.<br /><br />\nDr. Whitehead, professor of electrical engineering, announced before the Engineering Society at its<br />\nmeeting Monday that one summer<br />\nof practical work along some technical line would be required of all<br />\nengineering students before the<br />\nUniversity will confer a degree<br />\nupon them.<br />\nThe idea, original with the Hopkins technical department, has obvious advantages. The work is to<br />\nbe of such a character as to meet<br />\nwith the approval of the .professors,<br />\nand each student will be required<br />\nto make a, report on the work he<br />\nhas done. Dr. Whitehead said that<br />\nthe faculty would assist in finding<br />\nthe employment, but advised that<br />\nanyone with \"pull\" should endeavor<br />\nto locate himself.<br />\nThe announcement of the policy<br />\nhad not before been officially made<br />\nto students in the engineering<br />\ncourses, although many knew that<br />\nsuch a plan had been decided upon.<br />\nDr. Whitehead was the speaker before the Engineering Society Monday, and took that occasion to announce the faculty's rule.<br />\nDr. Whitehead then spoke on<br />\n\"The New Nitrogen-Filled Tungsten Lamps.\" These new incandescent lamps have an efficiency of 20<br />\nper cent, as compared with the 2<br />\nper cent, of the ordinary carbon<br />\nlamps, and the 10 per cent. of the<br />\ntungsten lamps now in use. They<br />\nare manufactured by the General<br />\nElectric Company, and are soon to<br />\nbe put on the market.<br />\nTwo of the lamps were shown<br />\nand their brilliancy nearly dazzled<br />\nthe audience, as they were of about<br />\n1,500 candle-power each.<br />\nBefore lighting the lamps, Dr.<br />\nWhitehead gave a brief account of<br />\nthe discoveries which led to their<br />\nproduction. He also gave a detailed description of their construction, and explained that the reason<br />\nlighting apparatus was so inefficient<br />\nas compared with other electric apparatus was because so much.energy<br />\nwas lost in heat.<br />\nAfter the meeting, the speaker<br />\nsaid that there was a great field for<br />\nwork in lighting problems and that<br />\nhe thought that \"cold light\" would<br />\nultimately be produced.<br />\nDr. Whitehead's talk was much<br />\nenjoyed by the members, who gave<br />\nhim a vote of thanks at the close<br />\nof his address.<br /><br />\nThe Medical Standard Book Co.<br />\n307 N.

The last two concerts have been described as \"rotten\" and \"frosts.\"<br />\n' According to reports, the Clubs<br />\n\"held together\" during the season<br />\ncovering the Eastern Shore trip<br />\nand the McCoy Hall entertainment,<br />\nbut there has been a decided lack<br />\nof interest shown by the members<br />\nsince. The concert in Catonsville<br />\nwas poorly given because of the<br />\nabsence of a great many of the<br />\nsingers and players through reasons unexplained, and concerts at<br />\nlocal churches have been affected<br />\nthe same way. A poor showing<br />\nhas been made because of wholesale absence.<br />\nThe managers of the Clubs say<br />\nthe members are not showing the<br />\nproper spirit, and the members say<br />\nthe management is at fault because<br />\nit has-arranged too many concerts<br />\nafter the McCoy Hall one. It so<br />\nhappens that a great many of the<br />\nmembers are now interested in<br />\nother activities and find it difficult<br />\nto \"keep up this singing and playing all year.\"<br />\nThe situation is indeed an unwholesome one. Those members<br />\nwho have stuck loyally to the finish<br />\ndeserve thanks, but it must be<br />\nremembered that the Clubs are<br />\nnot representing Hopkins as they<br />\nshould. One more concert is to be<br />\ngiven\u2014that at Walbrook.
