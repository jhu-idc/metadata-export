Chesanow added<br />\nthat the state laws committee<br />\nwould look into the Maryland<br />\nstate laws on homosexuality to<br />\nsee if the Gay Caucus should<br />\nremain as an official funded<br />\ncampus organization.<br />\nAnother frequent legal<br />\nproblem for students concerns<br />\ntheir rights as renters. Chesanow<br />\nsaid such troubles include lease<br />\ndisputes and landlords taking<br />\nadvantage of students. Since a<br />\nlarge percentage of students live<br />\noff-campus. Chesanow said the<br />\ncommittee will work to improve<br />\ntenants' rights.<br />\n<br />\nAlthough Chesanow has said<br />\nhe hopes to establish a University<br />\n- run legal- counselling service for<br />\nstudents, the project appears to<br />\nhave stalled in the<br />\nadministration. According to<br />\nHopkins legal Counsel Estelle<br />\nFishbein (whose office represents<br />\nonly the University - not the<br />\nstudents), a plan earlier advanced<br />\nby Dean of Students Jakie Hall<br />\nfor a University of Maryland law<br />\nstudent to provide advice to<br />\nHopkins students under faculty<br />\nauspices is unworkable due to the<br />\nlack of a law-school faculty<br />\nmember needed for the<br />\nprogram.<br />\n<br />\nGetting Shafted?<br />\nBY MITCHEL HYMAN<br />\n\"It's not the miners who have<br />\nheld the Americans hostage, it's<br />\nthe BCOA (Bituminous Coal<br />\nOperators Association),\"<br />\nemphasized Bessie Lou Cornett<br />\nin a presentation (\"The Struggle<br />\nin the Coal Fields and the<br />\nCurrent United Mine Workers<br />\nStrike\") last Sunday morning as<br />\npart of the Chaplain Office's<br />\nSunday Experience program.<br />\nMrs. Cornett, a striking miner's<br />\nwife, is a leading member of a<br />\nwomen's group from Harlan<br />\nCounty, Kentucky, supporting<br />\nthe miners' cause.<br />\nThe main cause for the United<br />\nWorkers'<br />\nmore, than<br />\nMine<br />\n80-day old strike is the mine<br />\nowners' attempts to weaken the<br />\nunion, she says. The mining<br />\ncompanies are presently<br />\nexpanding programs to strip-mine<br />\ncoal in the West. They would like<br />\nto break the UMW in order to<br />\nfully exploit these new resources<br />\nwithout losing any profits in<br />\nunion benefits. Mrs. Cornett<br />\ndescribed an incident in which<br />\nher step-father and some other<br />\nunion miners went to Wyoming<br />\nto organize strip-miners there.<br />\nThe group was \"tear-gassed and<br />\nthrown in jail\" by police<br />\nprotecting the mine owners'<br />\ninterests.<br />\nMrs. Cornett believes that the<br />\npresent contract offered by the<br />\nBCOA will not alleviate problems<br />\nwith grievance procedures in the<br />\nmines. Presently, miners do not<br />\nhave the right to refuse to work<br />\nunder dangerous conditions. She<br />\ncited a case in which a miner was<br />\nfired for refusing to work in the<br />\nproximity of a precariously<br />\nPerched, large rock, which fell<br />\n<br />\nThis WEEkENd IN ThE RAT<br />\n<br />\nsoon afterwards.<br />\nMost importantly, the new<br />\ncontract threatens the existence<br />\nof the union by denying miners<br />\nthe right to strike. The BCOA<br />\ninsist on including clauses which<br />\nwould give it the right to punish<br />\nstriking workers. This would<br />\nseriously undermine union<br />\npower.<br />\nIn spite of Arnold Miller's and<br />\nother union leaders' support of<br />\nit, Mrs. Cornett believes that<br />\nunion members should not and<br />\nwill not ratify the contract this<br />\nweek. \"Arnold Miller has sold the<br />\nminers out and the union is<br />\nnotworking in the best interests<br />\nof the miners,\" she said.<br />\nMrs. Cornett described tactic<br />\nused by the mine owners and<br />\npolice to undermine the union.<br />\nBecause the UMW controls only<br />\nabout 46% of the total U.S. coal<br />\noutput, union members have<br />\nbeen forcibly prevented by police<br />\nand the National Guard from<br />\nattempting to shut down<br />\nnon-union mines. Four hundred<br />\nminers have been arrested and<br />\nthree killed in the strike so far.<br />\nThe police have staged incidents<br />\nto provoke conflicts among<br />\nstrikers, she claimed. For<br />\ninstance, white policemen<br />\nenraged black picketers by calling<br />\nthem \"Niggers\". She claims the<br />\npress is not properly covering the<br />\nminers' side of the struggle by<br />\nignoring such incidents.<br />\nPresident Carter will invoke<br />\nthe Taft-Hartley Act by seizing<br />\nthe mines when miners refuse to<br />\nratify the contract, Mrs. Cornett<br />\npredicted. \"Jimmy Carter said<br />\nthat he supported labor, and I'd<br />\nlike to see him put his money<br />\nwhere his mouth is.\"<br />\n<br />\nOM<br />\n<br />\nFRidAy--dANcE TO ThE MUSIC Of \"TRIAD\"<br />\nRock-Top 40<br />\nSATuRdAy\u2014\"LOTUS BAND\"<br />\nRhyThm & bluEs<br />\nbE ThERE-A11.011A<br />\n<br />\nJack Lord<br />\nat the Rat<br />\n\u2022<br />\n<br />\n\fPAGE 4 I MARCH 3, 1978<br />\n<br />\nThe Hopkins<br />\n<br />\nNews Letter<br />\nThe News-letter is published weekly during the school year<br />\nby the students of the Johns Hopkins University.

Leadbetter: Member of the week<br />\n<br />\nHeads Will Roll!!!<br />\nA note of explanation. The News-Letter sincerely<br />\napologizes for any inconvenience caused by last Friday's<br />\n\"shortage\" of News-Letters. Apparently, some thugs took<br />\noffense at a particular sentence in an article and spirited<br />\n2000 copies away to their hideout. News of this heinous<br />\ndeed reached our ears Saturday night. Naturally our<br />\ndanders were stoked to new heights of outrage, but our<br />\noverwhelming concern was for the safety of the purloined<br />\nNews-Letter. On Sunday we entered delicate negotiations<br />\nwith intermediaries which assured us full return of the<br />\nstolen goods on Monday morning. Imagine our chagrin<br />\nwhen, upon examining the returned copies we saw an<br />\nobscenity stamped on what seemingly was the offending<br />\npassage.<br />\nFreedom of the press is one of the most precious liberties<br />\nwe have in America; anyone who has suffered through a<br />\nhigh school civics course knows that. This transgression of<br />\nbasic liberties ( plus the fact that our advertisers are giving<br />\nus hell) should not go unpunished. At this point, We have<br />\npassed the proverbial buck to higher authorities and<br />\ndisciplinary action will be done.<br />\nThe Maiyland Legislature just passed a new capital<br />\npunishment law. We hope this crime is covered in the new<br />\njudicial code.<br />\n<br />\nYour Big Chance<br />\nTired of the dismal life you lead at Hopkins?<br />\nHas anyone ever come up to you and said, \"Say, with a<br />\nkisser like that you ought to be in pictures?\" Have you ever<br />\nsaid to yourself, \"Say, with a kisser like this, why shouldn't<br />\nI be in pictures?\" Well, if you answered Yes to any of these<br />\nquestions, have we got a deal for you!!!<br />\nHcy, baby, ever hear of this outfit called the BBC?<br />\nThey're the guys who can write your ticket to stardom.<br />\nThere's a catch however.

BLUMENTHAL<br />\n<br />\nProfessor Owen M. Phillips, Chairman of the<br />\nDepartment of Earth and Planetary Sciences at<br />\nJohns Hopkins University , has devoted much<br />\ntime and effort to the study of the world's energy<br />\nproblems. Dr. Phillips anticipates the exnaustion<br />\nof oil and natural gas reserves within the next few<br />\ndecades. He decries the failure of our nation's<br />\nleaders to effectively implement a comprehensive<br />\nenergy program. Using his special expertise in<br />\nfluid mechanics and oceanography, Dr. Phillips<br />\nhas collaborated with other investigators in<br />\ndeveloping a method of extracting energy from<br />\nthe ocean.<br />\nNews-Letter: President Carter has warned all<br />\nAmericans that the United States faces an energy<br />\ncrisis of unprecedented magnitude. He has<br />\ndevoted considerable effort to persuading<br />\nCongress that it should pass his comprehensive<br />\nenergy bill.<br />\nUnfortunately, Congress has<br />\nexhibited the lethargy that is common to most<br />\nAmericans and has not acted. 16 your view, how<br />\nlong will'our present energy supplies last?<br />\nPhillips: This country is heavily dependent on<br />\noil in almost every phase of our life. We know<br />\nthat we have consumed more than two-thirds of<br />\nthe oil that there ever was in this country,<br />\nand that oil took three hundred million years to<br />\nform. We burned that up in tifty years.<br />\nThere is still oil to be found, no doubt about<br />\nthat. But it is going to be in deeper and less<br />\naccessible places which are more difficult to<br />\nreach. I am certain that we are going to continue<br />\nto find oil in bits and pieces, but the amounts will<br />\nbe ever smaller and ever harder to get at-Our<br />\ndomestic production of oil peaked about five<br />\nyears ago, and our dependence on imports is<br />\nincreasing. The critical problem is getting public<br />\nunderstanding of these facts. imported oil is<br />\ncosting us our shirts, and we must develop<br />\nalternate energy sources.<br />\nN-L: What is your opinion ot the President's<br />\nenergy policy and do you think any<br />\nmodifications should be made ill it?<br />\nPhillips: President Carter's energy policy is a<br />\nuseful first step, but it is no more than a first<br />\n<br />\nstep. It by no means solves the problem. It is alsc<br />\nfacing a great deal of difficulty from various<br />\nspecial interest groups.<br />\nthink that the difficulty in passing what<br />\nseems to me a very mild piece of legislation is so I<br />\ngreat that this really illustrates the Congress and '<br />\nthe public, although they are conscious of thc<br />\nenergy crisis, do not realize the gravity of thc<br />\nsituation.<br />\nN-L : Can the blame be placed on thc<br />\nAdministration for not aaving made the country I<br />\nmore aware of tne seriousness of the problem?<br />\nPhillips: One place that you may want to point<br />\nthe finger of blame is at che government's'<br />\nownU.S. Geological Survey.

He<br />\nwas dead right. Hubbard did tile same thing for<br />\nnatural gas, and 'le was a bit optimistic. Natural<br />\ngas is over its peak right now too. He was not<br />\ntaken very seriously for Li uite a long time. It has<br />\nonly been in the last seven years that people have<br />\nunderstood this approaca to the problem. The<br />\nremarkable thing is that Hubbard did this twenty<br />\nyears ago.<br />\nN-L: This nation possesses a highly motorized<br />\nsociety. Are there any practical ways in which we<br />\ncan reduce our oil consumption and still maintain<br />\nour present level of automotive transportation?<br />\nPhillips: We have to find alternatives for oil<br />\nand other fuels for our cars.1 still firmly believe<br />\nthat we like our cars so much that we will not go<br />\nback to riding horses. This is not a technological<br />\nproblem, but rather an economic one.<br />\nCars can run quite well on alcohol. But we<br />\nhave not started developing this process yet. If we<br />\nget started soon, it can be done. In Brazil they are<br />\nalready mixing alcohol and gasoline. Of course,<br />\n<br />\n\fracing cars run on alcohol. It is just a matter of<br />\nsetting up large-scale production facilities. There<br />\nis even an outfit in the U.S. that is marketing a<br />\nproduct called gasahol. it has sortie tax breaks,<br />\nand it is being sold at about the price of gas. So it<br />\nis possible to do it.<br />\nN\u2014L: Do the oil companies present much<br />\nopposition to proposals such as this?<br />\nPhillips: Oh, yes! That is probably one of the<br />\nmajor problems. One would have thought that<br />\nthe oil companies would have tried to develop<br />\nthis technique so that they could gain a<br />\nmonopoly over it. it has not worked that way,<br />\nhowever. it requires an investment of a large<br />\n\u2022<br />\namount of money, and maybe they do not have<br />\n\u2022\\\\<br />\nthe capital to do it with. The !-echonology has<br />\n\\\\<br />\n\u2022\\<br />\nbeen developed, but there has not been the<br />\noutlay of funds to improve the process.<br />\nN\u2014L: What are the possibilities of utilizing<br />\nnuclear power and what problems does this<br />\nenergy source present?<br />\nPhillips: Nuclear power, I think, is unlikely to<br />\nbe a long-term<br />\nanswer. The uranium isotope<br />\nU235 that is used is not a common metal and is<br />\nin limited supply. Therefore, the fuel for the<br />\nplants will pose a problem before too long.<br />\nA larger problem involves the disposal of<br />\nradioactive wastes. These highly active radioactive \u2022<br />\nwastes have just been stored underground. They<br />\n'<br />\n\u2022<br />\n.\u2022 \u2022.<br />\nhave just been accumulating and that is a problem<br />\nthat will become socially unacceptable soon.<br />\n\\<br />\nSo I do not see nuclear power as a long-term<br />\n.<br />\nanswer.

The<br />\nfirst is to create a consistent, well-characterized<br />\nproduction and to present it to an audience for<br />\nentertainment and approval. The second method is to<br />\ndirect a performance which will invariably please an<br />\naudience, while perhaps sacrificing character consistency<br />\nand the playwright's original conception. Laurlene Pratt,<br />\ndirector of Theatre Hopkins' current production of<br />\nVolpone, has taken the second route. The performance is<br />\ncertainly entertaining and enjoyable for an audience. It<br />\ndoes not hold up under closer scrutiny.<br />\nVolpone is a milestone in the history of drama . It is the story of a man who , with the<br />\naid of his servant , plays on the greed of his peers<br />\nto accrue a personal fortune . While it may be a<br />\nfarce, it is a sophisticated, responsible farce. It tends<br />\ntowards realism, has serious intent, and makes social<br />\ncriticism. It is the director's duty to insure that the<br />\nproduction does not become irresponsible. That is, that<br />\nthe didactic intent does not become tangled within a vine<br />\nof unbelievable events and characters, and thus removed<br />\nfrom the life of the play. The Theatre Hopkins<br />\nproduction, however, sacrifices serious content for the<br />\nsake of entertaining the audience. Not just occasionally,<br />\nas the superb script demands, but consistently, and at<br />\ntimes in violation of Ben Jonson's apparent intent.<br />\nNosca, the \"parasite,\" at one point enters, according to<br />\nthe script, \"wounded, bleeding.\" Mrs. Pratt has chosen to<br />\nignore this bit of direction, and replaces the serious face<br />\nwound with a light kick in the derriere. (That it is a light<br />\nkick is without doubt, for if it were a hard kick the pain<br />\nMosca feels would last longer than Mr. Basile's limp of<br />\n10-second durationwould indicate) This is entirely<br />\ninexcusable. Mosca has become caught in the process of<br />\nengineering the rape, by his master, pfa married woman.<br />\nThis is a morally reprehensible crime. Indeed, it is<br />\nmaterial better suited for tragedy than for farce. A<br />\nbelievable character of this time period would have<br />\nWounded Mosca severely, and with great justification. By<br />\naltering the nature of the wound, Mrs. Pratt has altered<br />\nthe nature of the farce. First, the didactic intent of the<br />\nwound is diluted into laughter. (The sight of blood on<br />\nstage generally stops laughter, at least temporarily)<br />\nSecond, Bonario becomes less believable being the<br />\nCharacter who inflicts the wound on Mosca. The result is<br />\nthat a responsible farce bcconies irresponsible.<br />\n<br />\nPROJECT UFO Takes Off<br />\n<br />\ngit.

The second key<br />\nelement is the stipulation that<br />\nparticipants ih he new BA-MD<br />\ntrack :,elect a second field of<br />\nconcentration outside biological<br />\nsciences. This \"minor\" might<br />\ninclude such areas as the<br />\nhumanities, engineering or the<br />\nsocial sciences.<br />\nDr. Hooker commented,\"Too<br />\nmany tiremeds concentrate on<br />\ntaking courses which they believe<br />\nwill enhance their chances for<br /><br />\nadmission into medical \u2022 school.<br />\nThis is a shared illusion.

The mining<br />\ncompanies are presently<br />\nexpanding programs to strip-mine<br />\ncoal in the West. They would like<br />\nto break the UMW in order to<br />\nfully exploit these new resources<br />\nwithout losing any profits in<br />\nunion benefits. Mrs. Cornett<br />\ndescribed an incident in which<br />\nher step-father and some other<br />\nunion miners went to Wyoming<br />\nto organize strip-miners there.<br />\nThe group was \"tear-gassed and<br />\nthrown in jail\" by police<br />\nprotecting the mine owners'<br />\ninterests.<br />\nMrs. Cornett believes that the<br />\npresent contract offered by the<br />\nBCOA will not alleviate problems<br />\nwith grievance procedures in the<br />\nmines. Presently, miners do not<br />\nhave the right to refuse to work<br />\nunder dangerous conditions. She<br />\ncited a case in which a miner was<br />\nfired for refusing to work in the<br />\nproximity of a precariously<br />\nPerched, large rock, which fell<br /><br />\nThis WEEkENd IN ThE RAT<br /><br />\nsoon afterwards.<br />\nMost importantly, the new<br />\ncontract threatens the existence<br />\nof the union by denying miners<br />\nthe right to strike. The BCOA<br />\ninsist on including clauses which<br />\nwould give it the right to punish<br />\nstriking workers. This would<br />\nseriously undermine union<br />\npower.<br />\nIn spite of Arnold Miller's and<br />\nother union leaders' support of<br />\nit, Mrs. Cornett believes that<br />\nunion members should not and<br />\nwill not ratify the contract this<br />\nweek. \"Arnold Miller has sold the<br />\nminers out and the union is<br />\nnotworking in the best interests<br />\nof the miners,\" she said.<br />\nMrs. Cornett described tactic<br />\nused by the mine owners and<br />\npolice to undermine the union.<br />\nBecause the UMW controls only<br />\nabout 46% of the total U.S. coal<br />\noutput, union members have<br />\nbeen forcibly prevented by police<br />\nand the National Guard from<br />\nattempting to shut down<br />\nnon-union mines. Four hundred<br />\nminers have been arrested and<br />\nthree killed in the strike so far.<br />\nThe police have staged incidents<br />\nto provoke conflicts among<br />\nstrikers, she claimed. For<br />\ninstance, white policemen<br />\nenraged black picketers by calling<br />\nthem \"Niggers\". She claims the<br />\npress is not properly covering the<br />\nminers' side of the struggle by<br />\nignoring such incidents.<br />\nPresident Carter will invoke<br />\nthe Taft-Hartley Act by seizing<br />\nthe mines when miners refuse to<br />\nratify the contract, Mrs. Cornett<br />\npredicted. \"Jimmy Carter said<br />\nthat he supported labor, and I'd<br />\nlike to see him put his money<br />\nwhere his mouth is.\"<br /><br />\nOM<br /><br />\nFRidAy--dANcE TO ThE MUSIC Of \"TRIAD\"<br />\nRock-Top 40<br />\nSATuRdAy\u2014\"LOTUS BAND\"<br />\nRhyThm &amp; bluEs<br />\nbE ThERE-A11.011A<br /><br />\nJack Lord<br />\nat the Rat<br />\n\u2022<br /><br />\nPAGE 4 I MARCH 3, 1978<br /><br />\nThe Hopkins<br /><br />\nNews Letter<br />\nThe News-letter is published weekly during the school year<br />\nby the students of the Johns Hopkins University.

The News-Letter sincerely<br />\napologizes for any inconvenience caused by last Friday's<br />\n\"shortage\" of News-Letters. Apparently, some thugs took<br />\noffense at a particular sentence in an article and spirited<br />\n2000 copies away to their hideout. News of this heinous<br />\ndeed reached our ears Saturday night. Naturally our<br />\ndanders were stoked to new heights of outrage, but our<br />\noverwhelming concern was for the safety of the purloined<br />\nNews-Letter. On Sunday we entered delicate negotiations<br />\nwith intermediaries which assured us full return of the<br />\nstolen goods on Monday morning. Imagine our chagrin<br />\nwhen, upon examining the returned copies we saw an<br />\nobscenity stamped on what seemingly was the offending<br />\npassage.<br />\nFreedom of the press is one of the most precious liberties<br />\nwe have in America; anyone who has suffered through a<br />\nhigh school civics course knows that. This transgression of<br />\nbasic liberties ( plus the fact that our advertisers are giving<br />\nus hell) should not go unpunished. At this point, We have<br />\npassed the proverbial buck to higher authorities and<br />\ndisciplinary action will be done.<br />\nThe Maiyland Legislature just passed a new capital<br />\npunishment law. We hope this crime is covered in the new<br />\njudicial code.<br /><br />\nYour Big Chance<br />\nTired of the dismal life you lead at Hopkins?<br />\nHas anyone ever come up to you and said, \"Say, with a<br />\nkisser like that you ought to be in pictures?\" Have you ever<br />\nsaid to yourself, \"Say, with a kisser like this, why shouldn't<br />\nI be in pictures?\" Well, if you answered Yes to any of these<br />\nquestions, have we got a deal for you!!!<br />\nHcy, baby, ever hear of this outfit called the BBC?<br />\nThey're the guys who can write your ticket to stardom.<br />\nThere's a catch however. For this Dylan Thomas shindig, all<br />\nyou longhairs have to visit to' the local tonsorial artist to get<br />\nclipped'.

Many societies honor<br />\nthe elder respected leaders of the<br />\ngroup, which we did with our<br />\nhonorary degree for Levi-Strauss<br />\nand Chester Kerr and the<br />\nprominent, dignified showing of<br />\nour faculty in full academic<br />\nrobes.Americans also seem to<br />\nenjoy honoring ideals, which we<br />\ndid with our Ode to the School,<br />\n\"the truth shall set you free,\"<br />\nand our encouragement of<br />\nscholarship and wisdom. Yet Dr.<br />\nMuller's speech was also an<br />\nimportant part of our<br />\nCommemoration Day Ritual and<br />\nwhat he was holding up for our<br />\nrespect and the object of our<br />\nhonor was a balanced<br />\nbudget.Muller took this occasion<br />\nto defend the University's \"sad\"<br />\ndecision to close the School of<br />\nHealth Services because of<br />\neconomic difficulties. The<br />\nimplication of Muller's speech<br />\nwas that this University's prime<br />\ncommitment is to having<br />\nlarge,readily accessible amounts<br />\nof money in hand in case it<br />\nshould be needed. Perpetually<br />\ntanned, and looking very healthy,<br />\nDr. Muller announed that<br />\nunfortunately) the School of<br />\nHealth Services had to go. The<br />\ntruth, though, is that the School<br />\nof Health Services in unique in its<br />\ncommitment to primary health<br /><br />\ncare, and that its graduates are<br />\nperforming necessary. services for<br />\npeople who badly need them.<br />\nThe United States needs more<br />\npractitioners of primary health<br />\ncare; physicians' assistants who<br />\naid people who cannot afford, or<br />\ncannot find where they live,<br />\ndoctors who graduate from the<br />\nfinancially solvent Johns Hopkins<br />\nSchool of Medicine.<br />\nTwo years ago the Princess of<br />\nIran was awarded an honorary<br />\ndegree and it was very obvious<br />\nthat our Commemoration Day<br />\nRitual honored financial support<br />\nfor the University above all else.<br />\nIt was less obvious this year, until<br />\nDr. Muller spoke.

BLUMENTHAL<br /><br />\nProfessor Owen M. Phillips, Chairman of the<br />\nDepartment of Earth and Planetary Sciences at<br />\nJohns Hopkins University , has devoted much<br />\ntime and effort to the study of the world's energy<br />\nproblems. Dr. Phillips anticipates the exnaustion<br />\nof oil and natural gas reserves within the next few<br />\ndecades. He decries the failure of our nation's<br />\nleaders to effectively implement a comprehensive<br />\nenergy program. Using his special expertise in<br />\nfluid mechanics and oceanography, Dr. Phillips<br />\nhas collaborated with other investigators in<br />\ndeveloping a method of extracting energy from<br />\nthe ocean.<br />\nNews-Letter: President Carter has warned all<br />\nAmericans that the United States faces an energy<br />\ncrisis of unprecedented magnitude. He has<br />\ndevoted considerable effort to persuading<br />\nCongress that it should pass his comprehensive<br />\nenergy bill.<br />\nUnfortunately, Congress has<br />\nexhibited the lethargy that is common to most<br />\nAmericans and has not acted. 16 your view, how<br />\nlong will'our present energy supplies last?<br />\nPhillips: This country is heavily dependent on<br />\noil in almost every phase of our life. We know<br />\nthat we have consumed more than two-thirds of<br />\nthe oil that there ever was in this country,<br />\nand that oil took three hundred million years to<br />\nform. We burned that up in tifty years.<br />\nThere is still oil to be found, no doubt about<br />\nthat. But it is going to be in deeper and less<br />\naccessible places which are more difficult to<br />\nreach. I am certain that we are going to continue<br />\nto find oil in bits and pieces, but the amounts will<br />\nbe ever smaller and ever harder to get at-Our<br />\ndomestic production of oil peaked about five<br />\nyears ago, and our dependence on imports is<br />\nincreasing. The critical problem is getting public<br />\nunderstanding of these facts. imported oil is<br />\ncosting us our shirts, and we must develop<br />\nalternate energy sources.<br />\nN-L: What is your opinion ot the President's<br />\nenergy policy and do you think any<br />\nmodifications should be made ill it?<br />\nPhillips: President Carter's energy policy is a<br />\nuseful first step, but it is no more than a first<br /><br />\nstep. It by no means solves the problem. It is alsc<br />\nfacing a great deal of difficulty from various<br />\nspecial interest groups.<br />\nthink that the difficulty in passing what<br />\nseems to me a very mild piece of legislation is so I<br />\ngreat that this really illustrates the Congress and '<br />\nthe public, although they are conscious of thc<br />\nenergy crisis, do not realize the gravity of thc<br />\nsituation.<br />\nN-L : Can the blame be placed on thc<br />\nAdministration for not aaving made the country I<br />\nmore aware of tne seriousness of the problem?<br />\nPhillips: One place that you may want to point<br />\nthe finger of blame is at che government's'<br />\nownU.S. Geological Survey.

He<br />\nwas dead right. Hubbard did tile same thing for<br />\nnatural gas, and 'le was a bit optimistic. Natural<br />\ngas is over its peak right now too. He was not<br />\ntaken very seriously for Li uite a long time. It has<br />\nonly been in the last seven years that people have<br />\nunderstood this approaca to the problem. The<br />\nremarkable thing is that Hubbard did this twenty<br />\nyears ago.<br />\nN-L: This nation possesses a highly motorized<br />\nsociety. Are there any practical ways in which we<br />\ncan reduce our oil consumption and still maintain<br />\nour present level of automotive transportation?<br />\nPhillips: We have to find alternatives for oil<br />\nand other fuels for our cars.1 still firmly believe<br />\nthat we like our cars so much that we will not go<br />\nback to riding horses. This is not a technological<br />\nproblem, but rather an economic one.<br />\nCars can run quite well on alcohol. But we<br />\nhave not started developing this process yet. If we<br />\nget started soon, it can be done. In Brazil they are<br />\nalready mixing alcohol and gasoline. Of course,<br /><br />\nracing cars run on alcohol. It is just a matter of<br />\nsetting up large-scale production facilities. There<br />\nis even an outfit in the U.S. that is marketing a<br />\nproduct called gasahol. it has sortie tax breaks,<br />\nand it is being sold at about the price of gas. So it<br />\nis possible to do it.<br />\nN\u2014L: Do the oil companies present much<br />\nopposition to proposals such as this?<br />\nPhillips: Oh, yes! That is probably one of the<br />\nmajor problems. One would have thought that<br />\nthe oil companies would have tried to develop<br />\nthis technique so that they could gain a<br />\nmonopoly over it. it has not worked that way,<br />\nhowever. it requires an investment of a large<br />\n\u2022<br />\namount of money, and maybe they do not have<br />\n\u2022\\\\<br />\nthe capital to do it with. The !-echonology has<br />\n\\\\<br />\n\u2022\\<br />\nbeen developed, but there has not been the<br />\noutlay of funds to improve the process.<br />\nN\u2014L: What are the possibilities of utilizing<br />\nnuclear power and what problems does this<br />\nenergy source present?<br />\nPhillips: Nuclear power, I think, is unlikely to<br />\nbe a long-term<br />\nanswer. The uranium isotope<br />\nU235 that is used is not a common metal and is<br />\nin limited supply. Therefore, the fuel for the<br />\nplants will pose a problem before too long.<br />\nA larger problem involves the disposal of<br />\nradioactive wastes.

The<br />\nfirst is to create a consistent, well-characterized<br />\nproduction and to present it to an audience for<br />\nentertainment and approval. The second method is to<br />\ndirect a performance which will invariably please an<br />\naudience, while perhaps sacrificing character consistency<br />\nand the playwright's original conception. Laurlene Pratt,<br />\ndirector of Theatre Hopkins' current production of<br />\nVolpone, has taken the second route. The performance is<br />\ncertainly entertaining and enjoyable for an audience. It<br />\ndoes not hold up under closer scrutiny.<br />\nVolpone is a milestone in the history of drama . It is the story of a man who , with the<br />\naid of his servant , plays on the greed of his peers<br />\nto accrue a personal fortune . While it may be a<br />\nfarce, it is a sophisticated, responsible farce. It tends<br />\ntowards realism, has serious intent, and makes social<br />\ncriticism. It is the director's duty to insure that the<br />\nproduction does not become irresponsible. That is, that<br />\nthe didactic intent does not become tangled within a vine<br />\nof unbelievable events and characters, and thus removed<br />\nfrom the life of the play. The Theatre Hopkins<br />\nproduction, however, sacrifices serious content for the<br />\nsake of entertaining the audience.
