Pullover<br />\nsweaters were also popular.<br />\nAs for the women, the<br />\nfashions were somewhat wider,<br />\nbut style fairly regular, relying on<br />\na rhetoric of coy innocence, be it<br />\nthrough bobby sox and blue<br />\njeans, or Peter Pan collars and<br />\nDoris Day dresses.

The<br />\nfilming, which will take place at<br />\nShriver Hall and other places on<br />\ncampus, will use many Hopkins<br />\nstudents as extras.<br />\nNot only will the documentary<br />\nbe the first on the life of the<br />\nfamous Welsh poet, but it will<br />\nalso be the biggest documentary<br />\nBBC/Wales has ever done.

Dylan Thomas was a<br />\nfigure of a sort that was highly<br />\nappreciated by college crowds of<br />\nthe Fifties; the sober conformity<br />\nof the age stood in sharp contrast<br />\nto his romantic individualism. His<br />\ncollege appearances met with<br />\nenthusiasm verging on mass<br />\nhysteria, and it is difficult today<br />\nto believe that large crowds of<br />\nstudents often massed in large<br />\nauditoriums to listen to and<br />\ncheer the Welsh poet.<br />\nFor this scene many Hopkins<br />\nstudents will be sought.

Never before or<br />\nafterwards in his life did he close a period so long as four<br />\nyears without some sensation of loss, but high school was<br />\nwhat, if after life, he commonly heard his cohorts dismiss<br />\nas a crock of shit,.<br />\nStretch was born too old for<br />\nschool. The same could be said of most New Jersey boys.<br />\nMentally they were never boys. Perhaps it was the<br />\npeculiar rarefied air, or some mysterious elixir in the<br />\ndrinking supply. Either way, the partisans of neighboring<br />\nstates refused to admit the superiority of the New Jersey<br />\neducational system. This haughty chauvinism instilled in<br />\nHogan a certain sense of cosmopolitan injustice he could<br />\nnever resolve.<br />\nHowever, young Hogan's mind was far removed from<br />\nsuch mawkish thoughts this balmy June's evening. He had<br />\njust completed payment of his intellectual multure to the<br />\nstate and was in the mood for some rantankerous<br />\npartying. The class muezzin had called off a swinging<br />\nsoiree at Senator Bateman's (admission: one dollar) and<br />\nthe message spread like a ranzesvaches among the lowly,<br />\nwho replied with their faithful mindless obedience. Alas,<br />\npoor Stretch's attendance was strictly verboten. His<br />\nthroat was under attack by the dreaded streptococcus<br />\nhooligan, and he regrettably retired to his sick bed. His<br />\nthoughts strayed to the lovely Beth Zvonchenko; he<br />\nsighed. High school was ending with a whimper, and not<br />\nthe bang Ms. Zvonchenko had promised.<br />\nAs Stretch began to snooze in his private nether world,<br />\nhe sorted the driftwood on the Sandman's beach. High<br />\nschool was a vile experience. Gym class in itself was the<br />\nmost degrading torture inflicted upon an American in<br />\npeacetime. Stretch was an inept gamesplayer; a spasmodic<br />\nspasticity and puny constitution relegated him to the role<br />\nof observer, which he did not mind one bit. The budding<br />\nintellectual regarded gym as an uneducation, a reversion<br />\nto those instincts central in the darkness of the human<br />\nsoul; sex and aggression. Besides, the ritual of dressing,<br />\nundressing and showering made his extremities tremble in<br />\nanxiety.<br />\nTo afford his classmates the opportunity of ridiculing<br />\nhis obvious shortcomings was well beyond Stretch's<br />\ntolerance. Genitalia was no prdblem; he could hold his<br />\nown in that department. Rather, his nakedness was held<br />\nin abeyance by an irrational, somewhat perverse fear that<br />\nsomeone might espy a neglected, stray dingleberry<br />\nhanging by the thinnest of hairs, a phobia so gross that he<br />\nnever told a soul.<br />\nYoung Hogan was out of place in high school, a stakes<br />\nwinner in a field of $3500 claimers. His outside reading<br />\n(reputed to be the most volumnious in S---'s history)<br />\nmade for an overeducated fool. Confronted with a<br />\ndangerous non sequitur such as \"Is that a banana in your<br />\npocket or are you glad to see me?\" Stretch would sputter<br />\ninto a Jack Benny state of fluster. And when he decided<br />\nto strike back, Stretch inevitably blundered,(the wretch,<br />\nthe unfortunate, etc.) \"Have a match?\" \"Yeah, my face<br />\nand your ass!\"<br />\nThe dream of college held out the chance for salvation<br />\nfor Stretch that summer. His first choice was Yale, but a<br />\nD in Calculus put an end to that fantasy. Though unable<br />\nto find Harrad in any catalog, Stretch still had the perfect<br />\ncollege picked. At this academic Utopia, Stretch knew his<br />\nintellectual talents would finally be appreciated,<br />\nspecifically appreciated.<br />\nThe dream of college held out the chance of salvation<br />\ni'or Stretch that summer. His first choice was Yale, but a<br />\nD. in Calculus put an end to that fantasy. Though unable<br />\nto find Harrad in any catalog, Stretch still had the perfect<br />\ncollege picked. At this academic Utopia, Stretch knew his<br />\nintellectual talents would finally be appreciated;<br />\nspecifically, by some adoring co-ed who would put Ms.<br />\nZvonchenko to shame. Oh, how he frittered away those<br />\nlong breathless nights by visions of the ultimate uniontof<br />\ngonads and gray matter. \"I love you for more than just<br />\nyour mind,\" she cooes. His blood beat fast with<br />\nanticipation that summer, the season that saw the<br />\ndownfall of Tricky Dick, afternoons at the track trying to<br />\nbeat the,Iron Men, and those endless drives up and down<br />\nthe shore looking for action while the radio sang all those<br />\nsacred songs of summer.<br />\nWith this in mind, imagine Stretch's chagrin upon his<br />\narrival at Johns Hopkins. Having never been away from<br />\nhome in his life, the effect of this sudden independence<br />\nwas somewhat akin to the panic a landlubber feels when<br />\nthrown into a lake to learn how toswim. He madly<br />\nflapped his arms about in this sea of gaudeamus and only<br />\nby accident, discovered the Dead Man's Float, which<br />\n,\u2022<br />\n<br />\nsuited this bumptious innocent well. He dreamed;of being<br />\nin a POW camp. His cell block was the first floor of<br />\nG---, (The \"Fin\") and his fellow inmates were nice<br />\nenough guys. For a time Stretch feared homosexual<br />\nromps; he had heard the Hopkins atmosphere was much<br />\nlike that of New England prep schools.<br />\nNevertheless, Stretch gradually settled down and began<br />\na modest collection of friends. Before dinner he would<br />\njourney down the hall and have a cocktail; often exhaust<br />\nfrom the mighty mezz (burned in a Pringle's bong)<br />\nsmoked his fellow inmates onto the Quad. Friday nights<br />\nthey got drunk; Saturday nights they got high. Stretch<br />\nwould get so buzzed his mind literally had a mind of its<br />\nown. It was during these all-too-frequent moments that<br />\nStretch first experienced twinges of compromise in his<br />\neducational philosophy. To this time, Stretch had<br />\nhypothesized the apex of education as complete mind<br />\ncontrol over the forces influencing one's existence.<br />\nNaturally,this point could never be reached, but it was a<br />\nvaliant pursuit anyway. Fearing he might be deemed<br />\ncrazy, Stretch never revealed this quixotic delusion. To<br />\nlead a life free of the fickleness of instincts and other<br />\nhuman weaknesses was the ultimate goal of Stretch's<br />\neducation, as he feared those dark incomprehensible<br />\nforces lurking within and waiting for the moment of least<br />\nresistance to break loose and throw him into a state of<br />\nchaos.<br />\nIn his present state, however, Stretch was still a dullard,<br />\na hayseed, to be exact. His sudden departure from<br />\nabstinence sometimes proved too much for his<br />\nunsuspecting system\u2014his bladder has never been quite the<br />\n<br />\n\"IT WAS HELL,\"<br />\nrecalls former child.<br />\n<br />\nran in vicious circles, as the debate waged between the<br />\nsacred and the profane, the ciuixotic and the practical. His<br />\npresence at Hopkins was definately a waste of the<br />\nuniverse's energy; yet he was not capable of a more<br />\nefficient path of existence. Faced with this problem of<br />\nrelatively monumental proportions, our young hero did<br />\nwhat any cowardly college student would do\u2014ne started<br />\nto beat the grape with a vengeance unknown to the<br />\nobservers of this debacle. He made nightly pilgrimages to<br />\nhis trough, the Rat, and ordered those sissy pitchers of<br />\nfetid Sangria, bloodied piss from demented zymurgists<br />\neager to take their sexual frustrations out on the drinking<br />\nworld. Of course, his studies suffered through this binge.<br />\nOne night, locked in the men's room, he looked into the<br />\ntoilet and saw his transcript - twirling away in I the_<br />\nwhirlpool of the flush. The vision was certainly enough to<br />\nsober him for a few weeks of studying, but it was too late.<br />\nHis report card came to his home iii New Jersey with<br />\nthree Cs, a D and a P in Words and Ideas. Mr. and Mrs.<br />\nHogan received a letter from those wizened sages of<br />\nHomewood House that warned such further performance<br />\nby their son would result in dire consequences.<br />\nIt was about this time Stretch had a close call with the<br />\nforces of the profane. Through a measly political<br />\nconnection, he secured a summer job with the township<br />\nroad department. \"This'll make a man out of you,\" a<br />\nvoice from offstage sermoned. But, as Stretch soon<br />\ndiscovered, shoveling dirt and spreading tar to the<br />\naccompaniment of a volley of fart jokes and risque<br />\nremarks from those toothless geezers he suffered the<br />\nindignity of calling \"Sir,\" was not the ticket to the macho<br />\nlifestyle. Rather, the job would have developed into a visa<br />\nfor Lowlife and Stretch would certainly haveinone of that<br />\nmalarkey. In an emotional scene worthy of the best of<br />\nMr. Ed, he tried to explainto his parents why this kind of<br />\nwork was unfit for him. His words were useless. Stretch<br />\nknew that peculiar glint in their eyes meant only one<br />\nthing. Their worst suspicions had been confirmed: their<br />\ndarling precious Stretch was a homosexual. To be<br />\nperfectly honest, Stretch himself even suspected this; his<br />\nprevious heterosexual yearnings were brought on more by<br />\nsocial learning (\"American see, American do\") than by<br />\nany genuine urges. Stretch had iiever bothered to ask<br />\nhimself mutt his sexual affiliation was. Dare this young<br />\nPrufrock eat a peach? This issue was still unresolved when<br />\nStretch returned to Baltimore for the completion of his<br />\neducation.<br />\n.14.\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022<br />\n<br />\n.r\u00a7<br />\n<br />\nsame--and often he felt ridiculed by taunts from those he<br />\nhad thought were his best friends. As hard as it was for<br />\nhim to admit it, Stretch was lonely, and lie had to put up<br />\nwith it. After all, isn't this the way college boys are<br />\nsupposed to act?<br />\nThe first semester whizzed by in Pass-Fail ,speed, and<br />\nsoon after Stretch's return in January the _season of<br />\npartying was upon the campus. Stretch and his buddies<br />\nwent from frat to frat humming \"Whose Soiree Now?\"<br />\nThe beer was warm and the women cold, and they all<br />\ntried to convince themselves what a good time they were<br />\nhaving. At one party he heard a feminine voice shout,<br />\n\"5--- High School, S--- High School,\" and he<br />\ntracked the source to a twerp he had once shared a class<br />\nwith, Mr. Grigg's Techniques of Writing. He dismissed her<br />\nwith the back of his hand. Stretch felt he was losing his<br />\n\"essence\" (a nebulous term he never defined) in these<br />\ninnumerable subterranean passages. He comforted himself<br />\nwith thoughts of Orpheus and the temptress Eurydice he<br />\nknew was waiting for him at the next frat.<br />\nOne Saturday night in the middle of March, Stretch<br />\nmade the near-fatal mistake of inixing the mighty mezz<br />\nand demon rum. The result was not at all pretty. The<br />\nQuad went red for an instant and his friends shuffled him<br />\noff to bed. Stretch dreamed of a Charlie Chan movie<br />\nwhere the murderer is left-handed...He woke early the<br />\nnext morning with his intestines writhing in pain. The<br />\nsmell of the communal bathroom on a Sunday morning<br />\nwas enough to make StretchwretchA vomit-filled urinal<br />\nand N--- setting aside his St. Christopher medal to<br />\nshave for church, the same N---- who locked his<br />\nroommate out the night before because. Stretch felt as if<br />\nhis eye had exploded. He slumped to the wet tile and<br />\ndefecated in his pants. Had he only been conscious,<br />\nStretch would have been proud to realize that lie had just<br />\nbeen the victim, as his mentor Joyce called it, of an<br />\nepiphany.<br />\nUpon his return from spring vacation, Stretch staggered<br />\ninto a state of mental dishevelment. To be sure, his mind<br />\n<br />\nrE<br />\n<br />\nRecently graduated and freshry- groomed, Mr. Stretch<br />\nHogan (BA '78) was faced with the age-old dilemma of<br />\nridding his fingertips of the auburn afterglow from a half<br />\nhour's nibbling oil pistachios the kindly barkeep had<br />\nserved to satiate the young ex-academic's anxiety.<br />\n\"Forget it pal,\" advised the bartender, a surly and burly<br />\nhulk of middle-aged man. \"Guys like you are stiffed all<br />\nthe time by broads--\"<br />\n\"She wasn't a broad,\" Stretch countered. \"Louisa was<br />\na nice girl.\"<br />\n\"That's what they all say, Mac,\" the bartender wiped<br />\nthe ring beneath Stretch's clenched glass. \"You need a<br />\nrefill?\"<br />\n\"I've got nothing better to do,\" Stretch replied. He was<br />\nno stranger to jiltings. Without fail, women thought of<br />\nhim as a charity case and agreed to a date only out of pity<br />\nfor the poor village schmendrick. The smarter ones got<br />\nheadaches or failed even to materialize. The others we'<br />\ndumb enough to actually go out with him and at the end<br />\nfind themselves in an awkward situation. \"it's not that I<br />\ndon't like you...\"<br />\ns Stretch took another swig of his drink. A parody from<br />\nhis salad days called to him.<br />\nAUGURIES OF ALCOHOLISM<br />\nTo see the world in a glass of gin,<br />\nAnd heaven in a Jack Daniels;<br />\nHold a martini in the palm of your hand,<br />\nAnd eternity in Happy Hour.<br />\nBe that as it may, Stretch rose from the bar stool and<br />\nwalked out into the cold winter's night. The.buzz of early<br />\nJanuary graduation was wearing off. Hopkins wi.s a real<br />\nbummer and he was glad to have that chapter ended. Even<br />\nthough it was early February, the colored Christmas lights<br />\nblinked in syncopation with the Budweiser sign. His car<br />\nwas parked out back by the bushes, but before lie arrived,<br />\nStretch spread open his coat and unzippered his fly. He<br />\nknew some guys just flipped their dicks out and let go in a<br />\ndisplay of derring-do, but Stretch always preferred to<br />\nhold on lest the flaccid hydraulics failed and the urine<br />\nwould splatter down his pants leg. Tonight Stretch was<br />\ndefiant. He flipped out his wasted potential, and adopted<br />\na proud posture, hands on hips. Nothing happened. He<br />\ngrunted and flexed the controlling muscles. Finally a<br />\ntrickle of urine drooled down his pants leg.

It was not until<br />\ntneir fourth album, Fragile, that Yes gained international<br />\npopularity. The same is true for Rennaissance, whicii was<br />\nonly a cult band before the release of their fourth album,<br />\nScherazade. And Jetaro Tull's fourth album was<br />\nAqualung. This theory, tilough, is more an exception taan<br />\na rule, but it should be noted in tile light.of Billy Joel'<br />\nfourth album, The Stranger.<br />\nOf course, popularity, superstardom and top-40 charts.<br />\nshould never be considered in rating tile true talent of a<br />\nperformer. But in the case of Billy Joel, it is about time<br />\nilC receivedrecognitionfor nis exceptional talents. Billy<br />\nJoel grew up on Long Island, and most of ills popularity<br />\nhas been centered in tile northeast. He writes tne music<br />\nand lyrics for all his'songs, and accompanies tnem on<br />\npiano, keyboards and vocals. He's certainly better than<br />\nthe senseless pounding and inane vocals of Elton John,<br />\nbut he's not on the same classical level as Rick Wakeman<br />\nor Tony Banks of Genesis. Billy Joel's talent lies<br />\nsomewnere in tile middle, thus making his music<br />\nappealing and accessable to all types of music listeners.<br />\nThe Stranger is a confluence of tne strengtils of Joel's<br />\nprevious three albums. All nad their moments of glory,<br />\nbut in The Stranger, mese strengths are organically joined<br />\ninto a satisfying waole. The music nas a fluid sound.<br />\nsparked by a touch of soul as a result of the work of<br />\nengineer Phil Ramone. The songs are more subt13.<br />\nconstructed without the bang-it-out-to-the-back-row:<br />\nconcert flash wilich often cilaracterized ais previow\u2022<br />\nalburns.Only \"Get it Right the First Time,\" \"Only tile<br />\nGood Die Young,\" and tile title song are like that on tne<br />\nnew album. There is a greater unity in tile songs, with tile<br />\nstress on the sound. The close-knit synthesis of ids<br />\ndifferent styles is the key difference between The<br />\nStranger and Billy Joel's previous albums.<br />\n<br />\nBilly Joel and his friend in Bellmore motel<br />\nTne greatest problem with The Stranger as witn all ins<br />\nalbums is the lyrics. They are cnaracteristically smartassed<br />\nand sarcastic. They always seem incomplete and unreal. in<br />\nan interview last year, wiien asked if the characters in tile<br />\nsong \"Captain Jack\" represented all tile people Joel knew<br />\nwhile growing up on Long Island, ne answered, \"No!\"<br />\nJoel never seems to finish a story or an idea, only giving<br />\nhis listeners fleeting tastes of wnat lie is trying to say. For<br />\nthe first time on The Stranger, thougn, the emphasis on<br />\nthe sounds lessens the bite of the lyrics which are<br />\n\"Moving Out\"<br />\nnecessary, but usually unfulfdling.<br />\nand '\"Just the Way You Are\" are musically among the<br />\nbest songs on tile albums, but the lyrics are forced and<br />\noverly simplistic. The former is a nard-driving song, but<br />\nthe story is sketchy and unconvincing. The latter is a<br />\nbeautiful and mellow ballad, witn maudlin lyrics. Tne<br />\nsong is characterized by a smooth and soulful electric<br />\npiano andsoft saxophone, making Mark-Almond sound<br />\nlike dried prunes. \"She's Always a Woman\" is an<br />\nexquisite song that is misleadingly tender. The song is a<br />\ndelicate and subtle blend of piano and acoustic guitars,<br />\nwith sensitive and warmilearted vocals. The lyrics, though,<br />\nare about a classy woman who is loving to tne narrator,<br />\nbut seems to be vicious and cruel to every otner person<br />\n<br />\nshe meets.<br />\nTile best and most diverse song on tile album is \"Scenes<br />\nfrom an Italian Restaurant.\" It is tne story of Brenda and<br />\nEddie planted in a Pinteresque \"room\"--ia tile form of an<br />\nItalian Restaurant--and tneir ultimate fall. This<br />\n-nulti-faceted song also ilas an Italian flavor. It opens with<br />\nsolo piano, setting the restaurant mood. Tile tempo<br />\npicks up as Joel rocks torouga tile tragic story of Brenda<br />\nand Eddie.

SOLOMON<br />\nWell, maybe we didn't drive all night. I mean we only<br />\ndrove down to tile Marble Bar but we certainly sat all<br />\nnight in a deep freeze, cold as marble, waiting for ,Elliot<br />\nMurphy. (Someone had sent aim to tile Brass Elephant to<br />\ndine, and everyone knows when toe chef there is on ne's<br />\non, but when ne's off...)<br />\nFor appetizers we tasted a jazz trio named Sorcerer.<br />\nwho were good, but tile rock roll audience was basically<br />\nunreceptive.<br />\nOnto the main course...the ten of us in the bar who<br />\nknew who Elliot Murphy was sat in electric anticipation,<br />\nwhile the others sat and talked., during the performance<br />\nthe cnosen ten sat and listened with intense concentration<br />\nbecause tile others continued to sit and talk. At times it<br />\nseemed Murphy was being chastised for interrupting their<br />\nconversations. The Marble Bar? Baltimore? OR PEOPLE<br />\nIN GENERAL??!!<br />\nElliot Murphy is a rock and roller from way back in the<br />\nlate sixties, a musical product of such diverse influences as<br />\nBob Dylan and Andy Warhol's Velvet Underground. He<br />\nsings like Dylan, writes lyrics and music like Lou Reed.<br />\nMurphy has been known in the past to play \"louder tnan<br />\nAerosmith,\" a curious stance for a troubadour so bent on<br />\ngetting his words heard. And many of thehi are quite<br />\ngood. A sampling from one of last night's songs, \"<br />\ncCaught Short in the Long Run :'<br />\nAnd you think of your family<br />\nAnd you're thinking it's been much too long<br />\nBecause you need some of their innocence and order<br />\nBut tnat medicine is much too strong<br />\nAnd we're nolding so tight and we're falling<br />\nAnd the funny thing is both are just the same<br />\nYou know freedom will find its own amusements<br />\nAnd it looks like we've found a waiting game<br />\nSo you torture yourself for that moment<br />\nWhen the only thing left is to feel<br />\nYou know romantics may run free in the darkness<br />\nBut get 'em in the light, they're the first to kneel<br />\nBut this tour was basic Elliot Murphy, rock and roll<br />\nballads with an acoustic guitar, a bass player and a female<br />\nbackup singer. The condensed group has its pros and cons.<br />\nIt forces the audience to take the songs as they are, and<br />\ndue to Murphy's five-chord musical vocabulary the sound,<br />\ngets repetitious. Some of the tunes lose the dynamics of<br />\nthe electronic guitar and drum combination. But most of<br />\n<br />\nthe songs worked well as folk ballads, tile bareness of the.<br />\npersonnel giving a new raw energy to tile material.<br />\nMurphy comes from a town in Long Island, and his<br />\nthemes reflect suburban life. His opening number,\"How's<br />\nthe Family\" (easily tne most successful song of tile<br />\nevening) is a beautiful evocation of the images<br />\nsurrounding toe soap opera life in suburbia. His songs are<br />\nneurotic screams about tile twentieth century engulfing<br />\nindividuals and destroying communication on any human<br />\nlevel. In \"Just a Story from America\" tile main character<br />\nsells out to a nigh society girl:<br />\nWhen she'd say<br />\nGet up when they put you down<br />\nBut like a boxer you just spin around<br />\nYo.ur kind of guy is so very few<br />\nDon't ever let 'em get the best of you.<br />\nswitches to:<br />\nAnd it say get up--they put you down<br />\nAnd like a boxeryou just spin around<br />\nYour kind of guy was so very few<br />\nI thought they'd never get the best of you.<br />\nThey are please to return to high school and fastcars, when<br />\nyou could drive all night and leave behind all<br />\nresponsibilities:<br />\nOh won't you be my night connection--drive all night<br />\nOh give me soul map correction--drive all night<br />\nAnd if the sun starts to catch us<br />\nWe'll paint the windows black<br />\nAnd we can drive all night--drive all night<br />\nWe got what's left and we got what's right<br />\n--drive all night.<br />\nOtner highlights were a song about Isadora Duncan<br />\ncalled, \"I've got to Meet Isadora's Dancers\" (Isadora and<br />\nthe Isadorables), \"Rich Girls,\" a song which ite claims<br />\nbombed at Sarah Lawrence, Vassar and Radcliffe (he<br />\nshould have tried Goucher), and as an encore Dylan's \"I<br />\nWant You\" because. in his own words.

In fact, F.W.J. Hemmings' The Life and<br />\nTimes of Emile Zola is the first Zola biography written in<br />\nEnglish in twenty-five years. Hemmings, naturally, has<br />\nhad access to biographical information unavailable to<br />\nprevious Zola biographers; consequently what he has<br />\naccomplished, in under two hundred pages, is a portrait of<br />\nZola that is at one and the same time an analysis of the<br />\nwriter's life, work, and society.<br />\nUnfortunately, the breadth and brevity of this<br />\nbiography are a mixed blessing, for what is gained in<br />\nscope is lost in depth. As an overview of a writer and of<br />\nhis society it is informative and pleasant reading, but<br />\nEnglish readers may have to wait another twenty-five<br />\nyears for a more detailed, comprehensive Zola biography.<br />\nWhat makes this particular biography interesting,<br />\nhowever, are tile numerous photographs, pairtings ,<br />\ncartoons and documents spread throughout the book.<br />\nThey often provide a fascinating commentary on the text<br />\nitself, especially in Mose chapters dealing with Zola aud<br />\nhis Impressionist painter friends. As a schoolboy, Zola<br />\nwas a classmate of Paul Cezanne; ironically, it was Zola,<br />\nnot Cezannne, who used to win the school prize for<br />\ndrawing. Their friendship continued, and Zola also<br />\nbecame friends with other Impressionists, among them<br />\nEdouard Manet.<br />\nZola, tile naturalist, was attracted to these painters<br />\nbecause, like himself, they were disgusted with the<br />\nconventions of neo-classical art, and sought to depict<br />\nmundane actions and ordinary people. He eventually fell<br />\nout with tile Impressionists when their interest in<br />\ncontemporary scenes and subjects was superseded by an<br />\nobsession<br />\nwith technical problems. Hemmings has<br />\nillustrated these chapters of his study with examples of<br />\nneo-classical painting, like Cabanel's \"Birth of Venus,\"<br />\ncontrasted with Impressionist paintings like Manet's<br />\n<br />\nEmile Zola<br />\n\"Dejeuner sur l'herbe\" and \"Olympia.\" Both paintings critical essays, three volumes<br />\nof short stories, and a<br />\nexemplify an interest in mundane subjects, in the former collection of plays.<br />\na bourgeois picnic, in the latter a young prostitute lying<br />\nHemmings places greater emphasis on the people in<br />\nnude on a sofa. Also, Hemmings has illustrated tile book Zola's life, whether they are literary<br />\nfriends like the<br />\nwith paintings of Zola by Cezanne and Manet. Of further Goncourt brothers, Gustave Flaubert, Ivan<br />\nTurgenev and interest are photographs taken by Zola, who acquired an Guy de Maupassant, or more intimate<br />\nfriends like his<br />\ninterest in photography toward the end of his life.<br />\nmistress Jeanne, by whom he had two children.

I shall conservative politicans. One member of the English<br />\naccomplish for the Second Empire, more methodically, House of Commons said of Zola's work: \"Nothing<br />\nmore<br />\nwhat Balzac accomplished in respect of the reign of diabolical had ever been written by the pen of man;<br />\nthey<br />\nLouis-Philippe.\" As with so many writers, Zola's project (the novels) were only fit for swine, and those who<br />\nread<br />\nbecame his life, and he devoted himself to documenting them must turn their minds into cesspools.\"<br />\nand writing the series.

His<br />\nsongs are a part of me. Wnen I found out that I'd actually<br />\nbe able to meet and interview him, it nearly blew my<br />\nmind.<br />\nAt his November appearance at the Baltimore Civic<br />\nCenter, the audience was enthusiastic and the concert<br />\nwent off well. He did a combination of songs, some of<br />\nwhich were old ones done in his own style, some of which<br />\nwere serious social protest songs in the tradition of his<br />\nfather, Woody Guthrie. Other songs were ridiculously<br />\nfunny and nad the audience laughing and clapping along<br />\nwith him. These were often introduced in his funny<br />\nrambling storytelling style.<br />\nAfter the concert I interviewed Arlo. His relaxed mood<br />\nput everyone at ease. At times he would laugh and joke;<br />\nat other times he was serious.<br />\nWnen Arlo started to explain what he meant by saying<br />\nthat he was both Catholic and Jewish (on the surface a<br />\nconfusing statement) ne said, \"I don't believe being<br />\nJewish is a cultural tiling. I think just because someone<br />\nhappens to be from a family that twenty centuries ago<br />\nhappened to be living around Palestine and their ancestors<br />\nmight have walked out with Moses or something like tliat,<br />\ndoesn't make them Jewish today. It's considered to be<br />\nthat, though. I blink being Jewish is at the same time by<br />\nblood it's also by faith, and so in that sense I'm Jewish.<br />\n\"I accept Christ as being the Messiah, as being the<br />\nAnnointed One of Israel and in that sense I liave to live by<br />\nfaith. Faith needs grace and grace comes from the<br />\nSacraments and that's wily I'm Catholic.\" Arlo was<br />\nallowed to clioose wilat religion ne wanted. He said, \"For<br />\nme tnat was joy.\" He is letting las three caildren,<br />\nAbraham, Cathyaliza, and Annie, nave that same<br />\nopportunity.<br />\n\"Schools are still like prisons 'Cause you don't learn<br />\nhow to live.\" Presidential Rag A.D.G. 1975.<br />\nWhat about schools? Does this song express his true<br />\n<br />\nopinion about them? Arlo said tnat he thought it<br />\namazing twit more kids just naven't walked out of<br />\nschools.\"I mean, if you think you're learning something<br />\nyou should be there, but if you feel you're not learning<br />\n.enough for tne time you spend there then you shouldn't<br />\nbe there. Schools treat people worse than jobs do. I mean,<br />\nno one asks a guy who works from 'nine to five to go<br />\nhome and do it. They ask that of every kid. They say you<br />\ngot to be there from nine to three every day and not only<br />\nthat, you got to go home and spend a couple of hours<br />\ndoing it. So your parents say shut up don't do this do<br />\nyour homework. That should be against the<br />\nlaw--homework.\"<br />\nWhat can we do to caange tile schools?<br />\n\"Well, there's really not much that the kids can do to<br />\nchange the schools. They can't vote or anything. All they<br />\ncan do is write on the desks, throw erasers at their<br />\nteachers, go out in the hall and get stoned, break windows<br />\nat night or something stupid like that. When nobody's<br />\ncoming to scnool and the schools are being destroyed, the<br />\neducators ought to start wondering now come and start<br />\ndoing something about it. I think that's what they're<br />\ndoing now. Because they realize that it just doesn't work<br />\nany more.\"<br />\nWhat about fame? Would you want the kind of fame<br />\nthat most famous rock stars have?<br />\n\"You can't really pick or choose fame, so I don't<br />\nusually think about it.\"<br />\nWould you like it if wnen you walked out on the street,<br />\nhalf a million people started running after you tearin'<br />\nyour clothes off?<br />\n\"If they were nice about it. But that nas nappened to<br />\nme before. It wasn't half a million folks, though.\"<br />\nDid you like it?<br />\n\"Sure, I jumped in somebody's car and said 'Drive\".It<br />\nwas these tiny little girls just this big and they rolled over<br />\nthese four big cops, just knocked 'em down! I jumped<br />\ninto a car and we drove off the stage. It was really weird.<br />\nThey were coming after me! It was great!!\"<br />\nWhen Arlo was asked where he would be going with his<br />\nmusic now he replied,\"To go eat some crabs.\"<br />\n<br />\n, The Theatre Project's schedule of free performances<br />\nthrough Sunday includes a serious work on violence, a<br />\ntcomedy piece on anger, a folksinger and a Sunday<br />\nmatinee in honor of the groundhog in his special month.<br />\nUpstairs at 8 p.m. through Sunday, Charles Kivette will<br />\npresent \"Yangsville,\" a work that explores and condemns<br />\nfive different kinds of violence in modern society.

With their<br />\nnew coach, Barbara Bishop, and a<br />\nmore experienced squad, this<br />\nYear's team will supply their<br />\nopposition with some tough<br />\nCompetition.<br />\nThus far, the Lady Jays are a<br />\ndisappointing 0-6, losing most<br />\nrecently to a tough Mt. St.<br />\nMary's team and a competitive<br />\nGallaudet College, though. Coach<br />\nBishop is generally pleased with<br />\ntheir progress, however. The Blue<br />\nJays' thirdgame against a tough<br />\nNotre Dame resulting in a 63-77<br />\nloss, showed many offensive<br />\nimprovements over their earlier<br />\ngames. Carole Stafford led the<br />\nOffensive drive with over 20<br />\nPoints scored. Monica Buescher<br />\nhas also shown tough offensive<br />\nPlay, leading the team in scoring<br />\nthrough their first two games.<br />\nMany of the Blue Jays'<br />\nProblems this year come from<br />\nPlayers they don't have. Only<br />\neleven women appear on the<br />\nroster, many of whom have little<br />\nor no previous playing<br />\nexperience. \"We just don't have<br />\nenough girls for the team\"<br />\ncomments Coach Bishop. \"All<br />\nthe teams on our schedule offer<br />\nbasketball scholdfaiips,\"--which<br />\nHopkins declines to do for any<br />\ns Port.Captains of the team<br />\ninclude small forwards Rita<br />\n<br />\nChang and Monica Buescher<br />\nalong with Carole Stafford in the<br />\ntall forward position.<br />\nRita,playing her fourth year of<br />\ncollege ball, has proven to be.a<br />\nstrong team leader. \"When I'm<br />\nlate for practice or having some<br />\nproblems getting things rolling,<br />\nRita can really exert herself in a<br />\n;eadership role,\" says Coach<br />\nBishop.<br />\n\"Dependable\" comes to mind<br />\nwhen Coach Bishop mentions<br />\nCarole Stafford and point guard<br />\nChi Mei Wu. Both Carole and Chi<br />\nMei perform in consistent<br />\nfashion, on both ends of the<br />\ncourt whenever their services are<br />\nneeded.<br />\nOne of the best prospects for<br />\nthis season is the skillful and<br />\nexperience freshman Joanne<br />\nEngler. Playing in the second<br />\nguard position, with an excellent<br />\noutside shot, Joanne can be a<br />\ntremendous asset for our<br />\nsometimes-bewildered Blue Jay<br />\noffense. Some adjustment<br />\nproblems have troubled Joanne<br />\nthus far, but Coach Bishop has<br />\ntremendous confidence in her,<br />\nstating, \"She will be an<br />\noutstanding player for us once<br />\nshe comes around.\"<br />\nThis season's most improved<br />\nplayer has been point guard Lynn<br />\nKatz. Coach Bishop remarks,<br />\n\"Off the bencn, Lynn has been a<br />\nvery pleasant surprise.\"<br />\nPlaying in the center position<br />\nwe have the 6'11<br />\n/<br />\n2\"freshman Chris<br />\nRansum, freshman Patti Smart,<br />\nand sophomore Sue Williams.<br />\n<br />\nWitn the addition of experience,<br />\nthe center spot will be a powerful<br />\nposition in the future.<br />\nAdding some experience in the<br />\nguard position we find junior<br />\nDorothea Cyper. She is a reliable<br />\nplayer and can add much to the<br />\n(team's consistency.<br />\nThe newest member of the<br />\nteam is sophomore Mandy<br />\n\u2022 Steeves. She will be playing in<br />\nthe guard position for the Blue<br />\nJay squad.<br />\nThe Blue Jays have been<br />\nplaying more aggressive<br />\nbasketball this season. Switching<br />\nzones, person to person defense<br />\nand full court presses are just a<br />\nfew of the additions brought to<br />\nHopkins by the new coach.<br />\nRunning of various plays by the<br />\noffense is also new to the team.<br />\nIt is clear that these additions<br />\nwill help in the building of a<br />\nskilled and competitive women's<br />\nbasketball team.<br />\nWhen asked if she enjoys<br />\ncoaching at Hopkins, Barbara<br />\nBishop replied, \"It's been quite<br />\nrefreshing. I like working with<br />\nthe girls and I like thier attitude.<br />\nThat makes it all worthwhile.\"<br />\nStill, the question remains as<br />\nto the permanence of any new<br />\ncoach for our women's team. Will<br />\nthe team request Coach Bishop<br />\nto return and will she have<br />\nthedesire to come back? One side<br />\nof this question has already been<br />\nanswered. When asked about her<br />\nintentions for next year, Coach<br />\nBishop replied, \"If they want me,<br />\n,they can nave me.\"<br />\n<br />\nGrapplers Going Good<br />\nBY JACK TYSON<br />\nWhile you were away over<br />\nIntersession relaxing, catching a<br />\ntan, or just fooling around, the<br />\nwrestling team was pushing itself<br />\nto the maximum.<br />\nOn January 7 they met<br />\nSusquehanna University and<br />\nsuffered Z, 43-10 setback.

This marks<br />\nthe second time in the past twc<br />\nweeks that senior Drew has sunk !<br />\na vital basket in the waning<br />\nmoments of the contest to give<br />\nthe net men a victory.<br />\nThe game had been dominated<br />\nby the Blue Jays throughout as<br />\nthey took a 41-28 lead into the<br />\nlockerroom at the half. A series<br />\nof fine Bear shots and Hopkins<br />\nmuffed plays late in the second<br />\nhalf brought the visitors within<br />\nstriking distance. They eventually<br />\ntook the lead with only seconds<br />\nleft.

Coach Jim Amen<br />\nattributed the loss to a lack of<br />\nmental preparedness. \"The team,<br />\ncoming off a five-game winning<br />\nareak, did not concern itself<br />\nwith the present game. They<br />\nthought of it as merely a sixth<br />\ngame instead of a sixth victory.\"<br />\nIn the first half, Hopkins made a<br />\npoor silowing, shooting only 36%<br />\nof their shots from toe field and<br />\nmissing nalf a dozen easy lay-ups.<br />\nHowever, the Jays didtake<br />\nadvantage of Swarthmore's many<br />\nfouls and made 86% of their foul<br />\nline shots.

The<br />\nteam, led by Captain Kevin<br />\nKabat, used all four corners and<br />\nran a solid, versatile defense<br />\nwhile keeping fouls to a<br />\nminimum. By keeping<br />\nElizabethtown off the foul line,<br />\nHopkins was able to net shots<br />\nand lead scoring. Dave Nagelberg<br />\nled the Jays' scoring, making 20<br />\npoints.

Since instructors are<br />\nnot paid, one can only assume<br />\nthat they enjoy preparing<br />\nc urriculum and teaching<br />\ninterested students. As University<br />\nStaff Director Judy Reilly<br />\ncommented, \"They're so nice,<br />\nand very dedicated. They take<br />\ntheir jobs, very seriously-as much<br />\nas a Paid person does, perhaps<br /><br />\nmore.\" She cites this as one<br />\nreason why BFU is<br />\nextraordinary.<br />\nCourse selection is also diverse.<br />\nEffective Cycling, Practical Home<br />\nGardening, and Creative Super-8<br />\nFilmmaking are three examples<br />\nof the offerings. The<br />\nDepartments of the BFU include:<br />\nLanguages, Music and Dance,<br />\nArt, Literature, Poetry, History,<br />\nScience, Society, Philosophy,<br />\nReligion, Spirituality, Health,<br />\nand others.<br />\nIn addition, the prices are<br />\nunbeatable. For the nominal<br />\nregistration fee of $5.00, overall<br />\ncosts for the classes range from<br />\n5% to 25% of what one would<br />\nnormally pay for books,<br />\nequipment, etc. at a regular<br />\nuniversity.<br />\nStudents in the BFU show<br />\ngreat interest and participate<br /><br />\nSOCIAL WORKERS \u2022 TEACHERS \u2022 PSYCHOLOGISTS<br /><br />\nTIRED OF HEARING ABOUT NO JOBS<br />\nAND NO SATISFACTION<br />\nIN YOUR CHOSEN PROFESSION?<br />\nWell if you have o Hebrew background, we invite<br />\nYou to kiss that rut goodbye and say hello to Israel.<br />\nIf You are o social worker (MSW, 135W), teacher or<br />\nPsYchologist\u2014or would like to be trained as a social worker, a<br />\nmost exciting and personally-rewarding career awaits you in<br />\nthe State of Israel.<br />\nInterviews will be conducted in the United States.

Let's stop<br />\ntalking and start doing.<br /><br />\nactively. Although almost all of<br />\nthe classes are taught on tile<br />\nHomewood Campus or nearby,<br />\nfew students come from<br />\nHopkins, Reilly stated. \"We're<br />\ntrying to get more interest on<br />\ncampus,\" she added, \"and it's<br />\nhard because people here are so<br />\nacademically oriented, that<br />\nwhatever free time they nave, if<br />\nthey have any free time at all, is<br />\ntaken up with studying.\"<br />\nWhile Reilly denied that tile<br />\nBFU courses are not<br />\nacademically oriented, she said<br />\nthat BFU's secret of success is<br />\nthat its courses are meant to be<br />\nenjoyable. The University was<br />\nstarted in 1968 by the Chaplain's<br />\nOffice, and has grown each year<br />\nto its present scope of nearly 700<br />\nstudents. Additional new courses<br />\nare planned for September, 1978.<br /><br />\ncrowd of students in Shriver Hall.<br />\nThis audience of students is<br />\nplanned to consist of volunteers<br />\nfrom Hopkins.<br />\nIn order to assure the<br />\ndocumentary accuracy of the<br />\nfilming, the students Who fill<br />\nShriver Hall will need to dress<br />\nand wear their hair in a way that<br />\nis accurate for the times<br />\ndepicted.<br />\nFor men, of course, this means<br />\nshort hair (although since most<br />\nhair was Brylcremed -.. into place Li<br />\nthose days, the hair does not<br />\nhave to be cut to fit the style),<br />\nand little or no facial hair. Also,<br />\ntheir pants should be cuffed and<br />\nbaggy, while their shirts will need<br />\nto be plain, with narrow collars<br />\nand very thin ties. Pullover<br />\nsweaters were also popular.<br />\nAs for the women, the<br />\nfashions were somewhat wider,<br />\nbut style fairly regular, relying on<br />\na rhetoric of coy innocence, be it<br />\nthrough bobby sox and blue<br />\njeans, or Peter Pan collars and<br />\nDoris Day dresses. Full<br />\ninformation on the proper<br />\napparel will be made available.<br />\nAlong with the Fifties<br />\nmock-up, the Student Council is<br />\ncurrently planning activities to<br />\ncorrespond with the filming,<br />\n. including a Fifties dahce designed<br />\nto put the day's costuming to<br />\n- good use, and to allow for<br />\nsocializing between members of<br />\nthe crew and the student body at<br />\nlarge.<br />\nAlthough details have not yet<br />\n.been settled, the Student Council<br />\nwill probably handle the<br />\nregistration ot those students<br />\ninterested in acting as extras in<br />\nthe filming. Those interested<br />\nshould contact the Council office<br />\nfor further details.<br />\nThe program, starring Ronald<br />\nLacey as Dylan Thomas and Gail<br />\nHonnicutt as nis American<br />\nfriend, Liz, will be aired on the<br />\nBBC next November to<br />\ncommemorate the twenty-fifth<br />\nanniversary of the poet's death in<br />\nNew York.

CONSIDINE<br />\nA British television<br />\ndocumentary on the life of poet<br />\nDylan Thomas will be filmed in<br />\npart on the Homewood Campus<br />\nthe weekend of March 18. The<br />\nfilming, which will take place at<br />\nShriver Hall and other places on<br />\ncampus, will use many Hopkins<br />\nstudents as extras.<br />\nNot only will the documentary<br />\nbe the first on the life of the<br />\nfamous Welsh poet, but it will<br />\nalso be the biggest documentary<br />\nBBC/Wales has ever done. The<br />\nfilming, which began in Wales<br />\nthis week, will cover the entirety<br />\nof Thomas' life, from his<br />\nchildhood in Wales to his death<br />\nin New York City.<br />\nChronicling his life on both<br />\nsides of the Atlantic, the BBC is<br />\ntrying to achieve complete<br />\naccuracy in depicting the times<br />\nof Thomas' life.

Dylan Thomas was a<br />\nfigure of a sort that was highly<br />\nappreciated by college crowds of<br />\nthe Fifties; the sober conformity<br />\nof the age stood in sharp contrast<br />\nto his romantic individualism. His<br />\ncollege appearances met with<br />\nenthusiasm verging on mass<br />\nhysteria, and it is difficult today<br />\nto believe that large crowds of<br />\nstudents often massed in large<br />\nauditoriums to listen to and<br />\ncheer the Welsh poet.<br />\nFor this scene many Hopkins<br />\nstudents will be sought.

Never before or<br />\nafterwards in his life did he close a period so long as four<br />\nyears without some sensation of loss, but high school was<br />\nwhat, if after life, he commonly heard his cohorts dismiss<br />\nas a crock of shit,.<br />\nStretch was born too old for<br />\nschool. The same could be said of most New Jersey boys.<br />\nMentally they were never boys. Perhaps it was the<br />\npeculiar rarefied air, or some mysterious elixir in the<br />\ndrinking supply. Either way, the partisans of neighboring<br />\nstates refused to admit the superiority of the New Jersey<br />\neducational system. This haughty chauvinism instilled in<br />\nHogan a certain sense of cosmopolitan injustice he could<br />\nnever resolve.<br />\nHowever, young Hogan's mind was far removed from<br />\nsuch mawkish thoughts this balmy June's evening. He had<br />\njust completed payment of his intellectual multure to the<br />\nstate and was in the mood for some rantankerous<br />\npartying. The class muezzin had called off a swinging<br />\nsoiree at Senator Bateman's (admission: one dollar) and<br />\nthe message spread like a ranzesvaches among the lowly,<br />\nwho replied with their faithful mindless obedience. Alas,<br />\npoor Stretch's attendance was strictly verboten. His<br />\nthroat was under attack by the dreaded streptococcus<br />\nhooligan, and he regrettably retired to his sick bed. His<br />\nthoughts strayed to the lovely Beth Zvonchenko; he<br />\nsighed. High school was ending with a whimper, and not<br />\nthe bang Ms. Zvonchenko had promised.<br />\nAs Stretch began to snooze in his private nether world,<br />\nhe sorted the driftwood on the Sandman's beach. High<br />\nschool was a vile experience. Gym class in itself was the<br />\nmost degrading torture inflicted upon an American in<br />\npeacetime. Stretch was an inept gamesplayer; a spasmodic<br />\nspasticity and puny constitution relegated him to the role<br />\nof observer, which he did not mind one bit. The budding<br />\nintellectual regarded gym as an uneducation, a reversion<br />\nto those instincts central in the darkness of the human<br />\nsoul; sex and aggression. Besides, the ritual of dressing,<br />\nundressing and showering made his extremities tremble in<br />\nanxiety.<br />\nTo afford his classmates the opportunity of ridiculing<br />\nhis obvious shortcomings was well beyond Stretch's<br />\ntolerance. Genitalia was no prdblem; he could hold his<br />\nown in that department. Rather, his nakedness was held<br />\nin abeyance by an irrational, somewhat perverse fear that<br />\nsomeone might espy a neglected, stray dingleberry<br />\nhanging by the thinnest of hairs, a phobia so gross that he<br />\nnever told a soul.<br />\nYoung Hogan was out of place in high school, a stakes<br />\nwinner in a field of $3500 claimers. His outside reading<br />\n(reputed to be the most volumnious in S---'s history)<br />\nmade for an overeducated fool. Confronted with a<br />\ndangerous non sequitur such as \"Is that a banana in your<br />\npocket or are you glad to see me?\" Stretch would sputter<br />\ninto a Jack Benny state of fluster. And when he decided<br />\nto strike back, Stretch inevitably blundered,(the wretch,<br />\nthe unfortunate, etc.) \"Have a match?\" \"Yeah, my face<br />\nand your ass!\"<br />\nThe dream of college held out the chance for salvation<br />\nfor Stretch that summer. His first choice was Yale, but a<br />\nD in Calculus put an end to that fantasy. Though unable<br />\nto find Harrad in any catalog, Stretch still had the perfect<br />\ncollege picked. At this academic Utopia, Stretch knew his<br />\nintellectual talents would finally be appreciated,<br />\nspecifically appreciated.<br />\nThe dream of college held out the chance of salvation<br />\ni'or Stretch that summer. His first choice was Yale, but a<br />\nD. in Calculus put an end to that fantasy. Though unable<br />\nto find Harrad in any catalog, Stretch still had the perfect<br />\ncollege picked. At this academic Utopia, Stretch knew his<br />\nintellectual talents would finally be appreciated;<br />\nspecifically, by some adoring co-ed who would put Ms.<br />\nZvonchenko to shame. Oh, how he frittered away those<br />\nlong breathless nights by visions of the ultimate uniontof<br />\ngonads and gray matter. \"I love you for more than just<br />\nyour mind,\" she cooes. His blood beat fast with<br />\nanticipation that summer, the season that saw the<br />\ndownfall of Tricky Dick, afternoons at the track trying to<br />\nbeat the,Iron Men, and those endless drives up and down<br />\nthe shore looking for action while the radio sang all those<br />\nsacred songs of summer.<br />\nWith this in mind, imagine Stretch's chagrin upon his<br />\narrival at Johns Hopkins. Having never been away from<br />\nhome in his life, the effect of this sudden independence<br />\nwas somewhat akin to the panic a landlubber feels when<br />\nthrown into a lake to learn how toswim. He madly<br />\nflapped his arms about in this sea of gaudeamus and only<br />\nby accident, discovered the Dead Man's Float, which<br />\n,\u2022<br /><br />\nsuited this bumptious innocent well. He dreamed;of being<br />\nin a POW camp. His cell block was the first floor of<br />\nG---, (The \"Fin\") and his fellow inmates were nice<br />\nenough guys. For a time Stretch feared homosexual<br />\nromps; he had heard the Hopkins atmosphere was much<br />\nlike that of New England prep schools.<br />\nNevertheless, Stretch gradually settled down and began<br />\na modest collection of friends. Before dinner he would<br />\njourney down the hall and have a cocktail; often exhaust<br />\nfrom the mighty mezz (burned in a Pringle's bong)<br />\nsmoked his fellow inmates onto the Quad. Friday nights<br />\nthey got drunk; Saturday nights they got high. Stretch<br />\nwould get so buzzed his mind literally had a mind of its<br />\nown. It was during these all-too-frequent moments that<br />\nStretch first experienced twinges of compromise in his<br />\neducational philosophy. To this time, Stretch had<br />\nhypothesized the apex of education as complete mind<br />\ncontrol over the forces influencing one's existence.<br />\nNaturally,this point could never be reached, but it was a<br />\nvaliant pursuit anyway. Fearing he might be deemed<br />\ncrazy, Stretch never revealed this quixotic delusion. To<br />\nlead a life free of the fickleness of instincts and other<br />\nhuman weaknesses was the ultimate goal of Stretch's<br />\neducation, as he feared those dark incomprehensible<br />\nforces lurking within and waiting for the moment of least<br />\nresistance to break loose and throw him into a state of<br />\nchaos.<br />\nIn his present state, however, Stretch was still a dullard,<br />\na hayseed, to be exact.

His<br />\npresence at Hopkins was definately a waste of the<br />\nuniverse's energy; yet he was not capable of a more<br />\nefficient path of existence. Faced with this problem of<br />\nrelatively monumental proportions, our young hero did<br />\nwhat any cowardly college student would do\u2014ne started<br />\nto beat the grape with a vengeance unknown to the<br />\nobservers of this debacle. He made nightly pilgrimages to<br />\nhis trough, the Rat, and ordered those sissy pitchers of<br />\nfetid Sangria, bloodied piss from demented zymurgists<br />\neager to take their sexual frustrations out on the drinking<br />\nworld. Of course, his studies suffered through this binge.<br />\nOne night, locked in the men's room, he looked into the<br />\ntoilet and saw his transcript - twirling away in I the_<br />\nwhirlpool of the flush. The vision was certainly enough to<br />\nsober him for a few weeks of studying, but it was too late.<br />\nHis report card came to his home iii New Jersey with<br />\nthree Cs, a D and a P in Words and Ideas. Mr. and Mrs.<br />\nHogan received a letter from those wizened sages of<br />\nHomewood House that warned such further performance<br />\nby their son would result in dire consequences.<br />\nIt was about this time Stretch had a close call with the<br />\nforces of the profane. Through a measly political<br />\nconnection, he secured a summer job with the township<br />\nroad department. \"This'll make a man out of you,\" a<br />\nvoice from offstage sermoned. But, as Stretch soon<br />\ndiscovered, shoveling dirt and spreading tar to the<br />\naccompaniment of a volley of fart jokes and risque<br />\nremarks from those toothless geezers he suffered the<br />\nindignity of calling \"Sir,\" was not the ticket to the macho<br />\nlifestyle. Rather, the job would have developed into a visa<br />\nfor Lowlife and Stretch would certainly haveinone of that<br />\nmalarkey. In an emotional scene worthy of the best of<br />\nMr. Ed, he tried to explainto his parents why this kind of<br />\nwork was unfit for him. His words were useless. Stretch<br />\nknew that peculiar glint in their eyes meant only one<br />\nthing. Their worst suspicions had been confirmed: their<br />\ndarling precious Stretch was a homosexual. To be<br />\nperfectly honest, Stretch himself even suspected this; his<br />\nprevious heterosexual yearnings were brought on more by<br />\nsocial learning (\"American see, American do\") than by<br />\nany genuine urges. Stretch had iiever bothered to ask<br />\nhimself mutt his sexual affiliation was. Dare this young<br />\nPrufrock eat a peach? This issue was still unresolved when<br />\nStretch returned to Baltimore for the completion of his<br />\neducation.<br />\n.14.\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022<br /><br />\n.r\u00a7<br /><br />\nsame--and often he felt ridiculed by taunts from those he<br />\nhad thought were his best friends. As hard as it was for<br />\nhim to admit it, Stretch was lonely, and lie had to put up<br />\nwith it. After all, isn't this the way college boys are<br />\nsupposed to act?<br />\nThe first semester whizzed by in Pass-Fail ,speed, and<br />\nsoon after Stretch's return in January the _season of<br />\npartying was upon the campus. Stretch and his buddies<br />\nwent from frat to frat humming \"Whose Soiree Now?\"<br />\nThe beer was warm and the women cold, and they all<br />\ntried to convince themselves what a good time they were<br />\nhaving. At one party he heard a feminine voice shout,<br />\n\"5--- High School, S--- High School,\" and he<br />\ntracked the source to a twerp he had once shared a class<br />\nwith, Mr. Grigg's Techniques of Writing. He dismissed her<br />\nwith the back of his hand. Stretch felt he was losing his<br />\n\"essence\" (a nebulous term he never defined) in these<br />\ninnumerable subterranean passages. He comforted himself<br />\nwith thoughts of Orpheus and the temptress Eurydice he<br />\nknew was waiting for him at the next frat.<br />\nOne Saturday night in the middle of March, Stretch<br />\nmade the near-fatal mistake of inixing the mighty mezz<br />\nand demon rum. The result was not at all pretty. The<br />\nQuad went red for an instant and his friends shuffled him<br />\noff to bed. Stretch dreamed of a Charlie Chan movie<br />\nwhere the murderer is left-handed...He woke early the<br />\nnext morning with his intestines writhing in pain. The<br />\nsmell of the communal bathroom on a Sunday morning<br />\nwas enough to make StretchwretchA vomit-filled urinal<br />\nand N--- setting aside his St. Christopher medal to<br />\nshave for church, the same N---- who locked his<br />\nroommate out the night before because. Stretch felt as if<br />\nhis eye had exploded. He slumped to the wet tile and<br />\ndefecated in his pants. Had he only been conscious,<br />\nStretch would have been proud to realize that lie had just<br />\nbeen the victim, as his mentor Joyce called it, of an<br />\nepiphany.<br />\nUpon his return from spring vacation, Stretch staggered<br />\ninto a state of mental dishevelment.

He was<br />\nno stranger to jiltings. Without fail, women thought of<br />\nhim as a charity case and agreed to a date only out of pity<br />\nfor the poor village schmendrick. The smarter ones got<br />\nheadaches or failed even to materialize. The others we'<br />\ndumb enough to actually go out with him and at the end<br />\nfind themselves in an awkward situation. \"it's not that I<br />\ndon't like you...\"<br />\ns Stretch took another swig of his drink.

Tonight Stretch was<br />\ndefiant. He flipped out his wasted potential, and adopted<br />\na proud posture, hands on hips. Nothing happened. He<br />\ngrunted and flexed the controlling muscles.

It was not until<br />\ntneir fourth album, Fragile, that Yes gained international<br />\npopularity. The same is true for Rennaissance, whicii was<br />\nonly a cult band before the release of their fourth album,<br />\nScherazade. And Jetaro Tull's fourth album was<br />\nAqualung. This theory, tilough, is more an exception taan<br />\na rule, but it should be noted in tile light.of Billy Joel'<br />\nfourth album, The Stranger.<br />\nOf course, popularity, superstardom and top-40 charts.<br />\nshould never be considered in rating tile true talent of a<br />\nperformer. But in the case of Billy Joel, it is about time<br />\nilC receivedrecognitionfor nis exceptional talents. Billy<br />\nJoel grew up on Long Island, and most of ills popularity<br />\nhas been centered in tile northeast. He writes tne music<br />\nand lyrics for all his'songs, and accompanies tnem on<br />\npiano, keyboards and vocals. He's certainly better than<br />\nthe senseless pounding and inane vocals of Elton John,<br />\nbut he's not on the same classical level as Rick Wakeman<br />\nor Tony Banks of Genesis. Billy Joel's talent lies<br />\nsomewnere in tile middle, thus making his music<br />\nappealing and accessable to all types of music listeners.<br />\nThe Stranger is a confluence of tne strengtils of Joel's<br />\nprevious three albums. All nad their moments of glory,<br />\nbut in The Stranger, mese strengths are organically joined<br />\ninto a satisfying waole. The music nas a fluid sound.<br />\nsparked by a touch of soul as a result of the work of<br />\nengineer Phil Ramone. The songs are more subt13.<br />\nconstructed without the bang-it-out-to-the-back-row:<br />\nconcert flash wilich often cilaracterized ais previow\u2022<br />\nalburns.Only \"Get it Right the First Time,\" \"Only tile<br />\nGood Die Young,\" and tile title song are like that on tne<br />\nnew album. There is a greater unity in tile songs, with tile<br />\nstress on the sound. The close-knit synthesis of ids<br />\ndifferent styles is the key difference between The<br />\nStranger and Billy Joel's previous albums.<br /><br />\nBilly Joel and his friend in Bellmore motel<br />\nTne greatest problem with The Stranger as witn all ins<br />\nalbums is the lyrics. They are cnaracteristically smartassed<br />\nand sarcastic. They always seem incomplete and unreal. in<br />\nan interview last year, wiien asked if the characters in tile<br />\nsong \"Captain Jack\" represented all tile people Joel knew<br />\nwhile growing up on Long Island, ne answered, \"No!\"<br />\nJoel never seems to finish a story or an idea, only giving<br />\nhis listeners fleeting tastes of wnat lie is trying to say. For<br />\nthe first time on The Stranger, thougn, the emphasis on<br />\nthe sounds lessens the bite of the lyrics which are<br />\n\"Moving Out\"<br />\nnecessary, but usually unfulfdling.<br />\nand '\"Just the Way You Are\" are musically among the<br />\nbest songs on tile albums, but the lyrics are forced and<br />\noverly simplistic. The former is a nard-driving song, but<br />\nthe story is sketchy and unconvincing. The latter is a<br />\nbeautiful and mellow ballad, witn maudlin lyrics. Tne<br />\nsong is characterized by a smooth and soulful electric<br />\npiano andsoft saxophone, making Mark-Almond sound<br />\nlike dried prunes. \"She's Always a Woman\" is an<br />\nexquisite song that is misleadingly tender. The song is a<br />\ndelicate and subtle blend of piano and acoustic guitars,<br />\nwith sensitive and warmilearted vocals. The lyrics, though,<br />\nare about a classy woman who is loving to tne narrator,<br />\nbut seems to be vicious and cruel to every otner person<br /><br />\nshe meets.<br />\nTile best and most diverse song on tile album is \"Scenes<br />\nfrom an Italian Restaurant.\" It is tne story of Brenda and<br />\nEddie planted in a Pinteresque \"room\"--ia tile form of an<br />\nItalian Restaurant--and tneir ultimate fall. This<br />\n-nulti-faceted song also ilas an Italian flavor. It opens with<br />\nsolo piano, setting the restaurant mood. Tile tempo<br />\npicks up as Joel rocks torouga tile tragic story of Brenda<br />\nand Eddie. This fast-moving section blends Joel's roaring<br />\nvocals with several superb clarinet and saxophone solos.<br />\nTne song then recapitulates the opening section witn tile<br />\ndownfall of Brenda and Eddie complete, and life going on<br />\nat the Italian Restaurant. In this song, Joel fuses the best<br />\nof all his styles to make this tnemost satisfying song on<br />\nthe album.<br />\nDespite Billy Joel's committment to continuous<br />\ntouring--ne is currently on nis first world tour--ae has<br />\nrushed into the studio and recorded nis cleanest and most<br />\ntechnically flawless album to date. Although tile lyrics are<br />\nstill deficient, the music is better thanever. Whether Billy<br />\nJoel truly becoines a superstar is unimportant. He has<br />\nrecorded a very good album--dis best yet--wilich should<br />\ngain him many new fans, and please toose who nave<br />\nalways appreciated him.<br /><br />\nElliot Murphy: Suburban Springsteen<br />\nBY NED A. SOLOMON<br />\nWell, maybe we didn't drive all night. I mean we only<br />\ndrove down to tile Marble Bar but we certainly sat all<br />\nnight in a deep freeze, cold as marble, waiting for ,Elliot<br />\nMurphy. (Someone had sent aim to tile Brass Elephant to<br />\ndine, and everyone knows when toe chef there is on ne's<br />\non, but when ne's off...)<br />\nFor appetizers we tasted a jazz trio named Sorcerer.<br />\nwho were good, but tile rock roll audience was basically<br />\nunreceptive.<br />\nOnto the main course...the ten of us in the bar who<br />\nknew who Elliot Murphy was sat in electric anticipation,<br />\nwhile the others sat and talked., during the performance<br />\nthe cnosen ten sat and listened with intense concentration<br />\nbecause tile others continued to sit and talk. At times it<br />\nseemed Murphy was being chastised for interrupting their<br />\nconversations. The Marble Bar? Baltimore? OR PEOPLE<br />\nIN GENERAL??!!<br />\nElliot Murphy is a rock and roller from way back in the<br />\nlate sixties, a musical product of such diverse influences as<br />\nBob Dylan and Andy Warhol's Velvet Underground. He<br />\nsings like Dylan, writes lyrics and music like Lou Reed.<br />\nMurphy has been known in the past to play \"louder tnan<br />\nAerosmith,\" a curious stance for a troubadour so bent on<br />\ngetting his words heard. And many of thehi are quite<br />\ngood. A sampling from one of last night's songs, \"<br />\ncCaught Short in the Long Run :'<br />\nAnd you think of your family<br />\nAnd you're thinking it's been much too long<br />\nBecause you need some of their innocence and order<br />\nBut tnat medicine is much too strong<br />\nAnd we're nolding so tight and we're falling<br />\nAnd the funny thing is both are just the same<br />\nYou know freedom will find its own amusements<br />\nAnd it looks like we've found a waiting game<br />\nSo you torture yourself for that moment<br />\nWhen the only thing left is to feel<br />\nYou know romantics may run free in the darkness<br />\nBut get 'em in the light, they're the first to kneel<br />\nBut this tour was basic Elliot Murphy, rock and roll<br />\nballads with an acoustic guitar, a bass player and a female<br />\nbackup singer.

Some of the tunes lose the dynamics of<br />\nthe electronic guitar and drum combination. But most of<br /><br />\nthe songs worked well as folk ballads, tile bareness of the.<br />\npersonnel giving a new raw energy to tile material.<br />\nMurphy comes from a town in Long Island, and his<br />\nthemes reflect suburban life. His opening number,\"How's<br />\nthe Family\" (easily tne most successful song of tile<br />\nevening) is a beautiful evocation of the images<br />\nsurrounding toe soap opera life in suburbia. His songs are<br />\nneurotic screams about tile twentieth century engulfing<br />\nindividuals and destroying communication on any human<br />\nlevel.

In fact, F.W.J. Hemmings' The Life and<br />\nTimes of Emile Zola is the first Zola biography written in<br />\nEnglish in twenty-five years. Hemmings, naturally, has<br />\nhad access to biographical information unavailable to<br />\nprevious Zola biographers; consequently what he has<br />\naccomplished, in under two hundred pages, is a portrait of<br />\nZola that is at one and the same time an analysis of the<br />\nwriter's life, work, and society.<br />\nUnfortunately, the breadth and brevity of this<br />\nbiography are a mixed blessing, for what is gained in<br />\nscope is lost in depth. As an overview of a writer and of<br />\nhis society it is informative and pleasant reading, but<br />\nEnglish readers may have to wait another twenty-five<br />\nyears for a more detailed, comprehensive Zola biography.<br />\nWhat makes this particular biography interesting,<br />\nhowever, are tile numerous photographs, pairtings ,<br />\ncartoons and documents spread throughout the book.<br />\nThey often provide a fascinating commentary on the text<br />\nitself, especially in Mose chapters dealing with Zola aud<br />\nhis Impressionist painter friends. As a schoolboy, Zola<br />\nwas a classmate of Paul Cezanne; ironically, it was Zola,<br />\nnot Cezannne, who used to win the school prize for<br />\ndrawing. Their friendship continued, and Zola also<br />\nbecame friends with other Impressionists, among them<br />\nEdouard Manet.<br />\nZola, tile naturalist, was attracted to these painters<br />\nbecause, like himself, they were disgusted with the<br />\nconventions of neo-classical art, and sought to depict<br />\nmundane actions and ordinary people. He eventually fell<br />\nout with tile Impressionists when their interest in<br />\ncontemporary scenes and subjects was superseded by an<br />\nobsession<br />\nwith technical problems. Hemmings has<br />\nillustrated these chapters of his study with examples of<br />\nneo-classical painting, like Cabanel's \"Birth of Venus,\"<br />\ncontrasted with Impressionist paintings like Manet's<br /><br />\nEmile Zola<br />\n\"Dejeuner sur l'herbe\" and \"Olympia.\" Both paintings critical essays, three volumes<br />\nof short stories, and a<br />\nexemplify an interest in mundane subjects, in the former collection of plays.<br />\na bourgeois picnic, in the latter a young prostitute lying<br />\nHemmings places greater emphasis on the people in<br />\nnude on a sofa. Also, Hemmings has illustrated tile book Zola's life, whether they are literary<br />\nfriends like the<br />\nwith paintings of Zola by Cezanne and Manet. Of further Goncourt brothers, Gustave Flaubert, Ivan<br />\nTurgenev and interest are photographs taken by Zola, who acquired an Guy de Maupassant, or more intimate<br />\nfriends like his<br />\ninterest in photography toward the end of his life.<br />\nmistress Jeanne, by whom he had two children.

I shall conservative politicans. One member of the English<br />\naccomplish for the Second Empire, more methodically, House of Commons said of Zola's work: \"Nothing<br />\nmore<br />\nwhat Balzac accomplished in respect of the reign of diabolical had ever been written by the pen of man;<br />\nthey<br />\nLouis-Philippe.\" As with so many writers, Zola's project (the novels) were only fit for swine, and those who<br />\nread<br />\nbecame his life, and he devoted himself to documenting them must turn their minds into cesspools.\"<br />\nand writing the series.

His<br />\nsongs are a part of me. Wnen I found out that I'd actually<br />\nbe able to meet and interview him, it nearly blew my<br />\nmind.<br />\nAt his November appearance at the Baltimore Civic<br />\nCenter, the audience was enthusiastic and the concert<br />\nwent off well. He did a combination of songs, some of<br />\nwhich were old ones done in his own style, some of which<br />\nwere serious social protest songs in the tradition of his<br />\nfather, Woody Guthrie. Other songs were ridiculously<br />\nfunny and nad the audience laughing and clapping along<br />\nwith him. These were often introduced in his funny<br />\nrambling storytelling style.<br />\nAfter the concert I interviewed Arlo. His relaxed mood<br />\nput everyone at ease. At times he would laugh and joke;<br />\nat other times he was serious.<br />\nWnen Arlo started to explain what he meant by saying<br />\nthat he was both Catholic and Jewish (on the surface a<br />\nconfusing statement) ne said, \"I don't believe being<br />\nJewish is a cultural tiling. I think just because someone<br />\nhappens to be from a family that twenty centuries ago<br />\nhappened to be living around Palestine and their ancestors<br />\nmight have walked out with Moses or something like tliat,<br />\ndoesn't make them Jewish today. It's considered to be<br />\nthat, though. I blink being Jewish is at the same time by<br />\nblood it's also by faith, and so in that sense I'm Jewish.<br />\n\"I accept Christ as being the Messiah, as being the<br />\nAnnointed One of Israel and in that sense I liave to live by<br />\nfaith. Faith needs grace and grace comes from the<br />\nSacraments and that's wily I'm Catholic.\" Arlo was<br />\nallowed to clioose wilat religion ne wanted. He said, \"For<br />\nme tnat was joy.\" He is letting las three caildren,<br />\nAbraham, Cathyaliza, and Annie, nave that same<br />\nopportunity.<br />\n\"Schools are still like prisons 'Cause you don't learn<br />\nhow to live.\" Presidential Rag A.D.G. 1975.<br />\nWhat about schools? Does this song express his true<br /><br />\nopinion about them? Arlo said tnat he thought it<br />\namazing twit more kids just naven't walked out of<br />\nschools.\"I mean, if you think you're learning something<br />\nyou should be there, but if you feel you're not learning<br />\n.enough for tne time you spend there then you shouldn't<br />\nbe there. Schools treat people worse than jobs do. I mean,<br />\nno one asks a guy who works from 'nine to five to go<br />\nhome and do it. They ask that of every kid. They say you<br />\ngot to be there from nine to three every day and not only<br />\nthat, you got to go home and spend a couple of hours<br />\ndoing it. So your parents say shut up don't do this do<br />\nyour homework. That should be against the<br />\nlaw--homework.\"<br />\nWhat can we do to caange tile schools?<br />\n\"Well, there's really not much that the kids can do to<br />\nchange the schools. They can't vote or anything. All they<br />\ncan do is write on the desks, throw erasers at their<br />\nteachers, go out in the hall and get stoned, break windows<br />\nat night or something stupid like that. When nobody's<br />\ncoming to scnool and the schools are being destroyed, the<br />\neducators ought to start wondering now come and start<br />\ndoing something about it. I think that's what they're<br />\ndoing now. Because they realize that it just doesn't work<br />\nany more.\"<br />\nWhat about fame? Would you want the kind of fame<br />\nthat most famous rock stars have?<br />\n\"You can't really pick or choose fame, so I don't<br />\nusually think about it.\"<br />\nWould you like it if wnen you walked out on the street,<br />\nhalf a million people started running after you tearin'<br />\nyour clothes off?<br />\n\"If they were nice about it. But that nas nappened to<br />\nme before. It wasn't half a million folks, though.\"<br />\nDid you like it?<br />\n\"Sure, I jumped in somebody's car and said 'Drive\".It<br />\nwas these tiny little girls just this big and they rolled over<br />\nthese four big cops, just knocked 'em down! I jumped<br />\ninto a car and we drove off the stage. It was really weird.<br />\nThey were coming after me! It was great!!\"<br />\nWhen Arlo was asked where he would be going with his<br />\nmusic now he replied,\"To go eat some crabs.\"<br /><br />\n, The Theatre Project's schedule of free performances<br />\nthrough Sunday includes a serious work on violence, a<br />\ntcomedy piece on anger, a folksinger and a Sunday<br />\nmatinee in honor of the groundhog in his special month.<br />\nUpstairs at 8 p.m. through Sunday, Charles Kivette will<br />\npresent \"Yangsville,\" a work that explores and condemns<br />\nfive different kinds of violence in modern society.

With their<br />\nnew coach, Barbara Bishop, and a<br />\nmore experienced squad, this<br />\nYear's team will supply their<br />\nopposition with some tough<br />\nCompetition.<br />\nThus far, the Lady Jays are a<br />\ndisappointing 0-6, losing most<br />\nrecently to a tough Mt. St.<br />\nMary's team and a competitive<br />\nGallaudet College, though. Coach<br />\nBishop is generally pleased with<br />\ntheir progress, however. The Blue<br />\nJays' thirdgame against a tough<br />\nNotre Dame resulting in a 63-77<br />\nloss, showed many offensive<br />\nimprovements over their earlier<br />\ngames. Carole Stafford led the<br />\nOffensive drive with over 20<br />\nPoints scored. Monica Buescher<br />\nhas also shown tough offensive<br />\nPlay, leading the team in scoring<br />\nthrough their first two games.<br />\nMany of the Blue Jays'<br />\nProblems this year come from<br />\nPlayers they don't have. Only<br />\neleven women appear on the<br />\nroster, many of whom have little<br />\nor no previous playing<br />\nexperience. \"We just don't have<br />\nenough girls for the team\"<br />\ncomments Coach Bishop. \"All<br />\nthe teams on our schedule offer<br />\nbasketball scholdfaiips,\"--which<br />\nHopkins declines to do for any<br />\ns Port.Captains of the team<br />\ninclude small forwards Rita<br /><br />\nChang and Monica Buescher<br />\nalong with Carole Stafford in the<br />\ntall forward position.<br />\nRita,playing her fourth year of<br />\ncollege ball, has proven to be.a<br />\nstrong team leader. \"When I'm<br />\nlate for practice or having some<br />\nproblems getting things rolling,<br />\nRita can really exert herself in a<br />\n;eadership role,\" says Coach<br />\nBishop.<br />\n\"Dependable\" comes to mind<br />\nwhen Coach Bishop mentions<br />\nCarole Stafford and point guard<br />\nChi Mei Wu. Both Carole and Chi<br />\nMei perform in consistent<br />\nfashion, on both ends of the<br />\ncourt whenever their services are<br />\nneeded.<br />\nOne of the best prospects for<br />\nthis season is the skillful and<br />\nexperience freshman Joanne<br />\nEngler. Playing in the second<br />\nguard position, with an excellent<br />\noutside shot, Joanne can be a<br />\ntremendous asset for our<br />\nsometimes-bewildered Blue Jay<br />\noffense. Some adjustment<br />\nproblems have troubled Joanne<br />\nthus far, but Coach Bishop has<br />\ntremendous confidence in her,<br />\nstating, \"She will be an<br />\noutstanding player for us once<br />\nshe comes around.\"<br />\nThis season's most improved<br />\nplayer has been point guard Lynn<br />\nKatz. Coach Bishop remarks,<br />\n\"Off the bencn, Lynn has been a<br />\nvery pleasant surprise.\"<br />\nPlaying in the center position<br />\nwe have the 6'11<br />\n/<br />\n2\"freshman Chris<br />\nRansum, freshman Patti Smart,<br />\nand sophomore Sue Williams.<br /><br />\nWitn the addition of experience,<br />\nthe center spot will be a powerful<br />\nposition in the future.<br />\nAdding some experience in the<br />\nguard position we find junior<br />\nDorothea Cyper. She is a reliable<br />\nplayer and can add much to the<br />\n(team's consistency.<br />\nThe newest member of the<br />\nteam is sophomore Mandy<br />\n\u2022 Steeves. She will be playing in<br />\nthe guard position for the Blue<br />\nJay squad.<br />\nThe Blue Jays have been<br />\nplaying more aggressive<br />\nbasketball this season. Switching<br />\nzones, person to person defense<br />\nand full court presses are just a<br />\nfew of the additions brought to<br />\nHopkins by the new coach.<br />\nRunning of various plays by the<br />\noffense is also new to the team.<br />\nIt is clear that these additions<br />\nwill help in the building of a<br />\nskilled and competitive women's<br />\nbasketball team.<br />\nWhen asked if she enjoys<br />\ncoaching at Hopkins, Barbara<br />\nBishop replied, \"It's been quite<br />\nrefreshing. I like working with<br />\nthe girls and I like thier attitude.<br />\nThat makes it all worthwhile.\"<br />\nStill, the question remains as<br />\nto the permanence of any new<br />\ncoach for our women's team. Will<br />\nthe team request Coach Bishop<br />\nto return and will she have<br />\nthedesire to come back? One side<br />\nof this question has already been<br />\nanswered. When asked about her<br />\nintentions for next year, Coach<br />\nBishop replied, \"If they want me,<br />\n,they can nave me.\"<br /><br />\nGrapplers Going Good<br />\nBY JACK TYSON<br />\nWhile you were away over<br />\nIntersession relaxing, catching a<br />\ntan, or just fooling around, the<br />\nwrestling team was pushing itself<br />\nto the maximum.<br />\nOn January 7 they met<br />\nSusquehanna University and<br />\nsuffered Z, 43-10 setback.
