'Any peact which fails<br />\nto achieve those elementary principles of democracy, hitherto denied in<br />\nlarge part to the Negro in the United<br />\nStates, must be regarded as tantamount to the loss of the war.'<br />\nFor the fulfillment of their domestic<br />\nwar aims, the Negroes demand only<br />\nthe 'full and complete applica)ion of<br />\nthe four freedoms of American life.'<br />\nThe first of these, the freedom 'to<br />\nworship God in their own way, they<br />\nhave had since the days of emancipation. But they have experienced<br />\nfreedoin of speech 'only within the<br />\nlimitations of their inferior political,<br />\neconomic and social status.' 'As<br />\nPresident Roosevelt 'declared on January 6, 1941, \"Literacy IS a prerequisite of free speech and gives it<br />\npoint.\"<br />\n44<br />\nBy freedom from fear, the Negroes<br />\nwant freedom from the 'political<br />\ndomination and physical oppression<br />\nwhich are characteristic of their existence in the south and, to some<br />\nextent, in the north.' Above all, they<br />\nwant the removal of all barriers to<br />\ntheir exercise of the franchise.<br />\nFreedom from want, to the Negro,<br />\nmeans 'something more than the<br />\nright to work and to fair play, adequate shelter, clothing, and security,'<br />\nDr Knox declared. To him, it means<br />\nthe freedom of economic opportunity,<br />\nthe freedom to compete on an equal<br />\nbasis with the white man for a place<br />\nin industry, in the armed forces, and<br />\nin all schools, elementary, secondary,<br />\nreinfegainriql<br />\n'In short he (the Negro) believes<br />\nthat the cultural and professional opportunities offered by the Johns Hopkins University, for instance, should<br />\nbe open to all groups of the popula-<br />\n<br />\nFinally, he demands the removal of<br />\nthe bars of segregation which have<br />\nbeen* set up in libraries, theaters,<br />\nhotels, restaurants, public parks,<br />\npublic conveyances, and the like.<br />\n'It is \u2022pritently clear,' said Dr Knox,<br />\n'that the achievement of the four<br />\nfreedoms' in America or anywhere<br />\nelse in the world is impossible within<br />\nthe framework of racial segregation.'To reach these ends of non-discrimination and non-segregation, Dr<br />\nKnox proposes federal legislation<br />\nabrogating all laws making race or<br />\ncolor distinctions between individuals,<br />\nfor any purpose whatever; the enforcement of the fourteenth and fifteenth amendments; the enactment<br />\nof an anti-poll tax bill; the 'abolition<br />\nof segregation and discrimination in<br />\nindustry and in the army; the continuance of the Fair Employment<br />\nPractice committee as an administrative body with power to enforce these<br />\nlaws; the withholding of federal funds<br />\nfrom any agency, including educational institutions, which practice<br />\ndiscrimination in the use of such<br />\nfunds; and, the representation of<br />\ncolored and minority groups on all<br />\nadministrative agencies.<br />\nTurning to the subject of international reconstruction after the war,<br />\nDr Knox emphasized that racial op-'<br />\npression and political and economic<br />\nsubjugation of minority and colonial .peoples must be abolished.

'Any peact which fails<br />\nto achieve those elementary principles of democracy, hitherto denied in<br />\nlarge part to the Negro in the United<br />\nStates, must be regarded as tantamount to the loss of the war.'<br />\nFor the fulfillment of their domestic<br />\nwar aims, the Negroes demand only<br />\nthe 'full and complete applica)ion of<br />\nthe four freedoms of American life.'<br />\nThe first of these, the freedom 'to<br />\nworship God in their own way, they<br />\nhave had since the days of emancipation. But they have experienced<br />\nfreedoin of speech 'only within the<br />\nlimitations of their inferior political,<br />\neconomic and social status.' 'As<br />\nPresident Roosevelt 'declared on January 6, 1941, \"Literacy IS a prerequisite of free speech and gives it<br />\npoint.\"<br />\n44<br />\nBy freedom from fear, the Negroes<br />\nwant freedom from the 'political<br />\ndomination and physical oppression<br />\nwhich are characteristic of their existence in the south and, to some<br />\nextent, in the north.' Above all, they<br />\nwant the removal of all barriers to<br />\ntheir exercise of the franchise.<br />\nFreedom from want, to the Negro,<br />\nmeans 'something more than the<br />\nright to work and to fair play, adequate shelter, clothing, and security,'<br />\nDr Knox declared. To him, it means<br />\nthe freedom of economic opportunity,<br />\nthe freedom to compete on an equal<br />\nbasis with the white man for a place<br />\nin industry, in the armed forces, and<br />\nin all schools, elementary, secondary,<br />\nreinfegainriql<br />\n'In short he (the Negro) believes<br />\nthat the cultural and professional opportunities offered by the Johns Hopkins University, for instance, should<br />\nbe open to all groups of the popula-<br /><br />\nFinally, he demands the removal of<br />\nthe bars of segregation which have<br />\nbeen* set up in libraries, theaters,<br />\nhotels, restaurants, public parks,<br />\npublic conveyances, and the like.<br />\n'It is \u2022pritently clear,' said Dr Knox,<br />\n'that the achievement of the four<br />\nfreedoms' in America or anywhere<br />\nelse in the world is impossible within<br />\nthe framework of racial segregation.'To reach these ends of non-discrimination and non-segregation, Dr<br />\nKnox proposes federal legislation<br />\nabrogating all laws making race or<br />\ncolor distinctions between individuals,<br />\nfor any purpose whatever; the enforcement of the fourteenth and fifteenth amendments; the enactment<br />\nof an anti-poll tax bill; the 'abolition<br />\nof segregation and discrimination in<br />\nindustry and in the army; the continuance of the Fair Employment<br />\nPractice committee as an administrative body with power to enforce these<br />\nlaws; the withholding of federal funds<br />\nfrom any agency, including educational institutions, which practice<br />\ndiscrimination in the use of such<br />\nfunds; and, the representation of<br />\ncolored and minority groups on all<br />\nadministrative agencies.<br />\nTurning to the subject of international reconstruction after the war,<br />\nDr Knox emphasized that racial op-'<br />\npression and political and economic<br />\nsubjugation of minority and colonial .peoples must be abolished.
