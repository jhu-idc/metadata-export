His snooping instinct aroused, the Sloz<br />\nsnooped over the cokes and, after much honest perspiring and attempted nonchalance, heard the fateful words President of the Student Council mentioned.<br />\nThe ingenuous Shining Light was stunned\u2014one<br />\nmight say he was struck speechless.<br />\nSo he didn't speak.<br />\nBut he did think.

That's what happened to friend Gustav in<br />\nGermany!<br />\nEven I, an innocent Sloz, can realize that now<br />\nand not the day before elections is the time to consider<br />\nthe men who'll be running me next year.

I will ask the<br />\nstudents to do two things, which will show that they<br />\nare smart.<br />\nFirst, I shall zealously ask them to start thinking,<br />\nbecause other people have already started thinking for<br />\nthem.<br />\nSecond, I shall ask them to zealously insist that all<br />\naspirants to office publicly proclaim and publish a<br />\nstatement of intention of policy (which they can do).<br />\nThen students will know what they are voting for, as<br />\nwell as who.<br />\nAnd so deciding, his Sloz-ish face glowed; he finished his lemon phosphate; he emerged into the spring<br />\nsunshine to carry out his mission; he lived happily<br />\never after.<br />\nMORAL: You don't have to be a Sloz, but don't be a<br />\nchump..
