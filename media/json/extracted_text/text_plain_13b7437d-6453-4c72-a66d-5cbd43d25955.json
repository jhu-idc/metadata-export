Girvin Peters, '98.<br />\nV<br />\nThe music is very snappy, and is well arranged for the piano. The<br />\nv \u2022<br />\n\u2022v<br />\nsentiment of the song is good, having one verse suitable for the football season and one for the lacrosse season. We have needed just<br />\nsuch a song, because \"Veritas Vos Liberabit\" is too serious and<br />\n\u2022 l\u2022 ivinorviiroing* \u2022<br />\ndignified to be sung at an athletic event, and neither ''Rah, for Black<br />\nand Blue!\" nor '`Our Alma Mater in Dixie Land\" are suitable for a<br />\nfootball or lacrosse game. Another objection to all of our old songs,<br />\nis that the music is written merely for the harmony and not so that it can be played to<br />\nadvantage on the piano. This is the second song that Mr. Peters has contributed to Hopkins,<br />\nhaving written both the words and music to \"Rah, for Black and Blue!\" which has become so<br />\npopular. On behalf of the students, we wish to thank Mr. Peters for giving us such a splendid song, and to urge him to continue to contribute songs and marches to Hopkins. We<br />\nregret that there is apparently no other Hopkins man who is capable of producing such admirable songs, but since such is the case, we shall have to depend upon Mr. Peters's genius to<br />\nsupply us with new songs for several years to come.<br />\n\u20140..1r2119<br />\n<br />\n412.4 11.<br />\nr<br />\ntr\u2022-----7-,<br />\nLtstti<br />\n1111<br />\nst n n n n nn ii n<br />\nn<br />\nx<br />\nli.<br />\n<br />\nN the last issue of THE NEWS-LETTER we offered a prize for the best<br />\ncover design, which should be submitted to the Board of Editors be,<br />\nfore December first.

We think that the one which we have selected will have just as successful a run<br />\nas did the old design.<br />\n<br />\n,firrir 4-<br />\n<br />\nT seems that at last Hopkins is to have a Dramatic Club. This is not<br />\njust mere rumor, as it has been for the past five or six years, but is an<br />\nactual fact. This year the matter was undertaken very quietly by<br />\ntwo<br />\nor three who were greatly interested in organizing such a club,<br />\nV<br />\ninstead of calling a mass meeting as has been done every fall for at<br />\nV<br />\nleast four years past. These few men went among the students and<br />\nfound out all who were interested in dramatics, and having got<br />\n\u2022 vvvvvvvvvvv<br />\nenough men to promise to support such an enterprise, called a meeting at which officers were elected and rules drawn up. A play<br />\nwill soon be decided upon and work will be commenced. We<br />\nunderstand that there is a student who has written a comic opera, and it is quite possible<br />\nthat the club will produce this: We feel confident that the Dramatic Club will meet with<br />\nsuccess and will be assisted by several of the professors.<br />\nNo doubt, there will be many who will hoot at the idea of a Dramatic Club, but there<br />\nare always some people who will try to discourage any enterprise, until it has become<br />\nwell established and successful, and then praise it and want to be associated with it. Let this<br />\nnew organization be well supported by the students. We shall give a full account of the<br />\nmatter in our next issue.<br />\n<br />\n3=3=1=3<br />\n<br />\nOW that the reunion is over, we may ask the question: What did the<br />\nundergraduates get out of it? In the first place, they got a lot of<br />\n21 .<br />\n22<br />\nsatisfaction.<br />\nTo begin with the lowest thing, it was satisfying to<br />\n:2<br />\n22<br />\n::<br />\n11<br />\nknow that the undergraduates' brass band made more noise at the<br />\ngame than all the other three put together. We showed the city and<br />\nthe alumni, that there is more college spirit at Hopkins than any21<br />\n0.--'. z\u2022<br />\nIt<br />\nbody ever dreamed of before. The great crowd, the singing and the<br />\n'<br />\n.<br />\n1 \u2022 12<br />\n\u2022 [z:,:: :: 1: I: 1: I: I: ::: ::<br />\nsplendid rooting proved that we can express this spirit in a forcible<br />\nOf<br />\nmanner, too.<br />\niisg, It 66.1<br />\nThen, we showed that we can lose a game like men. Did anybody ever see a Hopkins crowd take a defeat like that before? Not a sign of \"soreness,\" not<br />\na trace of childishness, but a fine spirit of manliness that would not be downed.<br />\nIt was something we had long been dreaming of, this day when the rising tide of<br />\nHopkins spirit should break the bounds of conservatism and overflow in some such way as<br />\nthis. All who took part in that wild demonstration on Homewood field, whether they bore<br />\nthe colors of St. John's or the Black and Blue, have something to remember with pride.<br />\nBest of all, we were given a glimpse of what it really means to the alumni to have been<br />\nHopkins men. The fact that two or three of those who came made a round-trip of six thousand miles, shows what a strong feeling they have fcr their college.<br />\nThe reunion was a revelation to the present students as well as to the alumni. Both<br />\nsides have profited by it. May both unite to give the University the full benefit of it all!<br />\n<br />\nCongratulations \"Ab,\" upon such a successful termination of your life of single<br />\nblessedness.<br />\n<br />\n\fTHE 'NEWS-LETTER.<br />\n<br />\n4<br />\n<br />\nTRAGEDIES IN MANUSCRIPTS.<br />\nCHARLES M. ANDREWS.<br />\n<br />\nHistorical science has its tragedies as well<br />\nas the medical sciences, but its victims are<br />\nvaluable manuscripts, not human lives. The<br />\nlong series of documentary sources, which<br />\nform the ultimate foundation upon which<br />\nhistory rests, is torn with rents and gaps that<br />\nare due to the accidents of history and the<br />\ncarelessness of human beings. The greatest<br />\nregret of the historian is for the documents<br />\nthat are lost, and his greatest hope, for the<br />\nultimate recovery of some of them. Scarcely<br />\nsixty years have passed since the preservation of historical records has been raised to<br />\nthe dignity of a separate and scientific pursuit, and their care and arrangement gained<br />\nthe attention, not only of scholars, but of<br />\ngovernments also. It is difficult to realize today how careless men have been in the treatment of documents, and how little interest<br />\nthey seem to have taken in records that are<br />\ndeemed priceless at the present time.<br />\nFor the accidents to which historical documents owe their destruction the individual<br />\ncan hardly be held responsible, except that in<br />\ngenerally neglecting to furnish suitable accommodation for records, he has rendered them<br />\nliable to destruction by fire and water, the two<br />\ngreatest enemies of the historian. Fires have<br />\nbeen the cause of the greatest tragedies in<br />\nhistorical science, and all archivists in all<br />\ncountries \u2022 have their stories of losses or of<br />\nnarrow escapes. Fires have destroyed great<br />\ncollections containing thousands of documents<br />\nor have injured the papers to such an extent<br />\nas to place them beyond the hope of repair.<br />\nSome of the fires have been the deliberate acts<br />\nof invading armies: as when the British troops<br />\nburned the Capitol in Washington in 1814, or<br />\nthe Federal troops, April 3, 1865, burned a<br />\npart of Richmond, including the Court House<br />\nin which were stored a great collections of<br />\nof ancient records. Such losses are unique<br />\nonly in their magnitude. The burning of the<br />\nBritish Custom House in London, in 1814,<br />\ncost our scholars some of the most important<br />\nmaterial for the history of colonial commerce;<br />\nthe fire which burnt to the ground the old<br />\nBanquetting Hall of Whitehall, in 1619, destroyed many books and papers of the Privy<br />\nCouncil Office, leaving a gap of twelve years<br />\n<br />\nin the history of that board; a fire, also in<br />\nWhitehall, in 1689 led to the loss of valuable<br />\ndepartmental papers, while the great fire of<br />\nLondon of 1666 and the burning of the Hotel<br />\nde Ville in Paris, in 1871 resulted in losses,<br />\nthe extent of which can never adequately be<br />\ndetermined. When in 1834, the Parliament<br />\nBuildings were burnt it was only by great<br />\npresence of mind that the manuscripts of the<br />\nHouse of Lords were saved. One of the<br />\ngreatest disasters in this country, though it<br />\naffected a somewhat narrower field of historical interest, occurred in 1906, when three<br />\nhundred volumes of Spanish archives of California, constituting the largest collections of<br />\nSpanish decrees, memorials, orders, and proceedings extant in the United States, were<br />\nentirely destroyed in the San Francisco earthquake and fire. It is more difficult to reconcile oneself to this loss when one remembers<br />\nthat an offer from the Library of Congress to<br />\nreceive these documents for safekeeping was<br />\nrefused in 1902 by the citizens of San<br />\nFrancisco.<br />\nMany losses have been incurred in the burning of private houses. The most famous<br />\ntragedy of this kind took place on October 23,<br />\n1731, when Ashburnham House at Westminister was burned, in which the priceless<br />\ncollection of Sir Robert Cotton was stored,<br />\nand large numbers of manuscript volumes<br />\nwere destroyed, or injured beyond repair. A<br />\nfire in the house of the historian, Mommsen,<br />\nresulted in the destruction of rare documents<br />\nloaned him by the German National Library,<br />\nfor which he and his friends were compelled<br />\nto pay many thousand marks. More recently,<br />\nabout 1890, the burning of the residence of a<br />\nGeorgia professor led to the total destruction<br />\nof a set of twenty-two volume of manuscripts<br />\nfrom British archives, which had been loaned<br />\nto him for historical purposes by the State.<br />\nFortunately these documents were only copies<br />\nand can be replaced. The sack of Thomas<br />\nHutchinson's house by a mob in Boston,<br />\nAugust 26, 1765, and the scattering of his<br />\npapers in the street, resulted in serious losses,<br />\nthrough the manuscript of his history .was in<br />\nlargest part preserved. Similarly, when the<br />\nhouse of the loyalist, Joseph Galloway, was<br />\nattacked in 1778 and his papers were scattered,<br />\nmany valuable letters, including probably<br />\n<br />\n\fTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\n<br />\nsome of Benjamin Franklin, were 'lever recovered.<br />\nLosses by fire or by mob violence are to be<br />\nregreted, but they do not arouse the exasperation of the historian, as do the losses which<br />\nhave been incurred through the indifference<br />\nor neglect of custodians. Two towns in<br />\nOnondago County, New York, burned up all<br />\ntheir old records, because they needed the<br />\nrooms in which they were stored. A superintendent of the Capitol in Nashville, Tennessee,<br />\nhad 3000 great books, relating to the State<br />\nbank and its branches, ripped from their<br />\ncovers and sold to the paper dealers, while the<br />\ncovers were sent to a filling dump. Clerks,<br />\nattendants, and even higher officials, underpaid or receiving insufficient fees for their<br />\nmaintenance, have sold the old parchments<br />\nand papers in their custody to make glue or to<br />\nbe pulped for the making of new paper. Local<br />\nVirginia historians have recorded their sentiments at the sight of numerous fragments of<br />\nseals near a paper mill to which State<br />\nemployees had been selling old documents.<br />\nA barrel of Franklin papers was recovered in<br />\nthe nick of time from a paper mill in New<br />\nJersey, and in not a few instances valuable<br />\nhistorical evidence has been obtained from the<br />\nparchment backing used in binding books of<br />\nmodern date. More Franklin papers were<br />\nrecovered some sixty years ago from a tailor's<br />\nshop in London, where the tailor was already<br />\nbeginning to use them in making his paper<br />\npatterns. Even when not deliberately sold,<br />\ndocuments in official custody have been made<br />\na quarry for the conscienceless collector. Custodians have taken advantage of their stewardship to reap some small gain from their<br />\nopportunity and have often driven hard bargains in selling either the documents them selves or the right to exploit them. As a<br />\nresult stamps have been torn off, signatures<br />\ncut out, and even complete documents purloined. The enthusiasm for 'extra-illustrating,\" for gathering autographs and holographs, and for collecting prints, stamps,<br />\nand book-marks seems to dull the human<br />\nsense of honesty. To many men and women<br />\nthe theft of a document seems but a small<br />\noffence. It has taken many years to impress<br />\nupon the world the sacredness of national<br />\narchives.<br />\n<br />\n5<br />\n<br />\nLess culpable, but no less serious, in its<br />\nconsequences was the practice which prevailed<br />\nup to very recent times of carrying off the<br />\nrecords to private houses. Early judges and<br />\ngovernment officials in England deemed court<br />\nrolls and state papers their private property,<br />\nand at the expiration of their term of office<br />\ncarried them home. Hence such records<br />\nfound their way into private collections, into<br />\nthe chests containing the family archives, or<br />\ninto the hands of the auctioneers in the great<br />\nbook-shops. This practice explains why so<br />\nmany state papers are today either in private<br />\nhands or in possession of great libraries like<br />\nthe British Museum. Hundreds of papers<br />\nthus taken were of course lost, and there are<br />\nperiods and phases of English history, notably<br />\nin the first quarter of the nineteenth century,<br />\nfor which source material is disheartingly<br />\nmeagre on account of the abstractions of official papers by persons in service under the<br />\ngovernment. George Chalmers, clerk of the<br />\nCouncil Committee of Trade, and once a lawyer in Baltimore, frequently borrowed manuscript volumes of the Board of Trade, and<br />\nmany of these he never returned, a fact that<br />\nis known from the actual record of his loans<br />\nwhich is still preserved. Of the library founded<br />\nby the munificence of Richard Whitington at<br />\nthe Guildhall three cart-loads of volumes,<br />\nall manuscripts, were lent to Protector Somerset in the reign of Edward VI, and on his<br />\ndownfall in 1552 were irrecoverably lost. Occasionally lost documents can be traced, and<br />\nthe Cecil, Harleian, Cottonian, and other<br />\ngreat private collections disclose papers that<br />\nought by right of origin to be in official<br />\ncustody.<br />\nThe gross neglect which has characterized<br />\nthe care of records in the past is one of the<br />\nleast pardonable of all the sins against the<br />\nwriting of history. Of some thirty reports<br />\nmade during the last decade upon our State<br />\narchives there is not one but contains its tale<br />\nof woe. Placed in charge of ignorant and<br />\ncareless custodians, to whom often an ancient<br />\ndocument is a useless incumbrance, valuable<br />\nrecords have been relegated to any place of<br />\ndeposit not wanted for other purposes. In<br />\ngarrets, lofts, closets, and bins, in tanks,<br />\nvaults, coal holes, and stables, these records<br />\nhave been subjected to every kind of indignity.<br />\n<br />\n\f6<br />\n<br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\n<br />\nThey have been drenched with water, soaked<br />\nwith the filth of leaking sewers, rotted with<br />\nthe damp and mold of underground cellars,<br />\nscattered by the wind during repairs to buildings, trodden under foot while lying in corridors used for daily passage, transformed into<br />\nfestering heaps of useless and dangerous material, ravaged by mice and vermin, and in<br />\ncases where still in use were allowed to remain<br />\nunrepaired and to be worn away bit by bit<br />\nuntil reduced to fragments too fragile and<br />\ntattered to be of service. Each one of these<br />\nstatements could be proved by an overwhelming, mass of evidence. Little wonder that<br />\npapers thus neglected are subjected to vandalism and plunder. Who can blame the janitor<br />\nthat uses such papers found in a cellar to start<br />\nhis fires, as happened in the case of the public<br />\narchives of Delaware. The blame falls on<br />\nthose in authority, who out of a mistaken<br />\nsense of economy, have failed to make any<br />\nadequate provision, in the way of housing or<br />\nstaff, for the preservation and classification of<br />\nthe papers.<br />\nBut the dark ages are passing. Urged on<br />\nby the private student and the literary worker,<br />\nand by historical associations and influential<br />\ncommittees, governments are rising to a sense<br />\nof their responsibility and to an appreciation<br />\nof the national disgrace. In great repositories<br />\nlike the Bibliotheque Nationale, the Public<br />\nRecord Office, the British Museum, and the<br />\nLibrary of Congress a document is cared for<br />\nas a thrice welcome guest. In fire-proof surroundings, on dry and commodious shelves,<br />\nbound in volumes or laid in boxes, the<br />\nneglectea and abused record has at last returned to its own. The British Museum<br />\nrejects no fragment, even though it be but a<br />\nblank paper. All great archives devote to the<br />\nrepair of documents a skill that is little short<br />\nof marvelous. Holes are filled in, rents<br />\nbrought together, ragged edges guarded, folds<br />\nironed out, fragile papers covered with linen<br />\ntissue, and then these renovated papers and<br />\nparchments are bound or filed, classified,<br />\nticketted, stamped, and arranged for convenient use. To tamper with such a document,<br />\nto tear it, mark it, or carry it away, subjects<br />\nthe guilty person to rejection from the repository. Though a great deal yet remains to be<br />\ndone in the lesser repositories, and though<br />\n<br />\nlarge numbers of documents of great value<br />\nstill remain in private hands constantly subject to loss, yet in the main it may be said<br />\nthat the sacredness of historical records is at<br />\nlast recognized and tlw eventual concentration of the majority of such records in safe<br />\nquarters is now only a matter of time.<br />\n<br />\nTo the Editor of THE NEWS-LETTER:<br />\nSIR \u2014In view of the recent discussion in<br />\nyour columns of a proposed treaty betwcen<br />\nfraternities, there are several points, I think,<br />\nwhich have not been sufficiently emphasized.<br />\nAn inter-fraternity treaty, in the first place,<br />\nmust be an agreement, made solely for the<br />\ngeneral welfare, and based on the consent al d<br />\napproval of all. It does not contemplate a<br />\nbargain by which each fraternity benefits. itself, at the expense of some other fraternity.<br />\nA treaty based solely upon the idea of force<br />\nand of penalties cannot succeed. The word<br />\n'treaty' suggests an agreement which it is to<br />\nthe interests of all to preserve, not an opportunity for the parties to that treaty to elude<br />\nits provisions. A I understand it, the general<br />\nprovisions are suggested as benefits, not as<br />\nrestrictions to be imposed and enforced through<br />\nstern penalties.<br />\nI will not admit so great a lack of confidence among ourselves that an agreement of<br />\nthis nature is impossible; nor do I believe that<br />\nthere is wanting a general feeling that an ei:d<br />\nshould be set to the recognized abuse of early<br />\npledging.<br />\nYours very truly,<br />\n<br />\nGEORGE E. Ross VEAZEY.<br />\n<br />\nFIRST STUDENT BIBLE CONFERENCE.<br />\nInspired by the gigantic forward strides of<br />\norganized student Bible study, with its revolutionary effect on the lives of individuals and<br />\ncolleges, the first International Bible Conference was called to convene at Columbus, Ohio,<br />\nOctober 22-25, to consider the further extension of Bible study in the colleges of North<br />\nAmerica. There were present 1022 delegates<br />\nrepresenting 220 institutions of the United<br />\nStates and Canada. It was a truly representative college assembly containing men prominent in the athletic, the social and the intel-<br />\n<br />\n\fTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\n<br />\nlectual , sides of college life. Members of<br />\nfaculties were among the delegates as well as<br />\namong the speakers. Realizing the college<br />\nconditions of America, as only such a body of<br />\nmen could, it goes without emphasizing that<br />\ntheir deliberations were carried on with great<br />\njudgment and wisdom. A distinctive feature<br />\nof the conference was the marvelous earnestness of spirit; the aim was not to magnify and<br />\nextend the student Bible study propaganda,<br />\nbut rather to bring some tangible force for<br />\ngoodness and greatness to the individual, to<br />\nthe college and to the nation.<br />\nThe importance of student Bible study, as<br />\nportrayed by the results of the past five years,<br />\nis no less interesting than significant. During<br />\nthe last year there were 048,882 men enrolled<br />\nin Bible classes in the colleges of North<br />\nAmerica, 33,663 of whom attended two months<br />\nor more. There were 6,740 men holding<br />\npositions of prominence in college life of 364<br />\ninstitutions, 4,022 fraternity man in 125 institutions, and 3,898 non-Christian men in<br />\n217 institutions enrolled in Bible study classes.<br />\nProbably the most striking evidence that the<br />\nstudent Bible study movement is a great and<br />\nfar-reaching propaganda destined to touch<br />\neventually every student of North America in<br />\none way or another was given by individuals<br />\nrepresenting the various colleges and schools.<br />\nCol. Lamed, of West Point, told of the<br />\nstrenuosity of life and strictness of discipline<br />\nthat the Army Cadets are forced to undergo,<br />\nand how every hour of the day, save 40 or 45<br />\nminutes, has something mapped out for them.<br />\nIn spite of this very serious handicap there<br />\nare, of the 415 cadets, 245, or about'60% enrolled in Bible study courses requiring 15 or<br />\n20 minutes of daily study. There are in<br />\nBible study 46 of 106 seniors, 5 of 10 honor<br />\nmen, the captains of baseball and football<br />\nteams, a group composed solely of football<br />\nmen, and 11 of the 18 senior cadet officers.<br />\nThe movement at Yale has increased in<br />\nthree years from 500 men in eight groups to<br />\nabout 1,000 men in ninety groups. There<br />\nare 27 dormitory classes, in fact every \"dorm\"<br />\nhas at least one, besides one in the training<br />\nhouse. At the University of Toronto, the<br />\nnumber jumped from 152 in '06\u2014'07 to 950<br />\nlast year. There were more than 700 enrolled<br />\nat the time of the Columbus conference, with<br />\n<br />\n7<br />\n<br />\nonly 200 men belonging to the Y. M. C. A.<br />\nThe University of Texas had 600 men in<br />\nclasses with twelve different fraternity groups.<br />\nAt Cornell the enrollment increased from 330<br />\nin '06\u2014'07 to 742 last year.<br />\nThe University of Illinois was the banner<br />\ncollege of America in Bible study last year,<br />\nhaving 1,050 men enrolled, with 802 attending two months or longer. There were thirteen<br />\nfraternity Bible study groups containing 300<br />\nof the 500 fraternity men. This year practically every fraternity is anxious to have a<br />\nClass, and it is confidently expected that<br />\nalmost the entire fraternity body will enroll.<br />\nThese are typical institutions and many other<br />\nequally interesting accounts could be cited.<br />\nIt is, beyond a reasonable doubt true, that<br />\nBible study among students is gathering momentum and becoming more and more a part<br />\nof student life. It can be justly asked, \"What<br />\ngood is resulting therefrom?\" \"What is the<br />\nfundamental purpose of this movement?\"<br />\nThe answer unhesitatingly comes, \"The<br />\nsymmetrical development of the college man<br />\nin his life work.\" We dub the man a \"grind\"<br />\nwho develops nothing but his mental faculties.<br />\nThe fellow who does everything else but study<br />\nwe call a \"sport\" or even some more inglorious name. The man who combines the<br />\nqualities of the \"grind\" and the \"sport\" is<br />\nknown as a \"good all-around fellow.\" Now<br />\nit is a matter of general knowledge that these<br />\nthree classes, in many cases, fail to make<br />\ngood. The reason is, lack of symmetrical development or rather lack of spirit. By spirit<br />\nI don't mean altogether bull-dog tenacity and<br />\npersistance, rather a deeper consciousness that<br />\ngives a man a constant, dignified and unaffected poise. This, to my mind, is the mission<br />\nof Bible study among college men. The study<br />\nof the Bible not only puts men in touch with<br />\nthe world's most significant personalities, but<br />\nit also reports the experience of men with<br />\nhigher powers and with that Spirit whose<br />\npresence makes them clean and strong and<br />\nnoble.<br />\nIt is a matter of the largest concern to every<br />\nman, what he is going to be to his home, his<br />\ncommunity, his State and his nation. It has<br />\nbeen proven again and again that it is totally<br />\ninsufficient for a man to simply desire to be<br />\njust and kind in his dealings with his fellows;<br />\n<br />\n\fTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\n<br />\n8<br />\n<br />\nin order to be so there must be some fundamental principles or creed back of that desire.<br />\nThe philosophy of Christ, as laid down in the<br />\nNew Testament, is matchless, and is so conceded by every class of mind. To what better<br />\nplace can a man go for his creed, and to what<br />\nbetter place can a nation look for the inspiration of her cleanest and best.statesmen, jurists,<br />\nfinanciers and men of affairs?<br />\n<br />\n\u2022 J.

This<br />\nshould be one of the greatest events of the<br />\nyear for the Hopkins students. The special<br />\nattraction of the evening is \"The Girl Question,\" which is known to be one of the best<br />\nshows of the season.

Mr. Albert Ritchie, known all over the<br />\ncity as an after:dinner speaker, has consented<br />\nto speak between the acts. He will be introduced by Prof. H. P. Mustard. Everyone<br />\nknows that he can count on hearing \u2022 a<br />\ncracker-jack\" speech from Mr. Dashiell,<br />\nand also that he will be favored with number\u2022<br />\nless interesting remarks by Prof. Mustard.<br />\nIt is hoped that every student enrolled at<br />\nthe University will take this opportunity of<br />\nhelping out the 1909 Hullabaloo and ot showing Baltimore people how much we all honor<br />\nand respect old Hopkins.<br />\nTickets can be brought from students, or at<br />\nthe cloak room. Everybody come down and<br />\nhelp swell the throng.<br />\nAs a last remark, don't buy only one<br />\nticket, buy two.

M., Wednesday, November 18, 1908, in<br />\nMcCoy Hall. There were thirty men present,<br />\ntwenty-three of these were old men and the<br />\nremainder freshmen. Such an interest is a<br />\nsource of great joy to the president, and he<br />\nhopes that this attendance, as good as it is,<br />\nwill be bettered.<br />\nThe meeting was called to order by President Perce, who at once congratulated the<br />\nmembers present upon the fine attendance,<br />\nand urged upon them the necessity of having<br />\na large membership. A roll call showed that<br />\nthere were two pianists present, about four<br />\nviolinists, quite a number of mandolinists,<br />\nwhile almost everyone present claimed to be<br />\nsomething of a singer.<br />\nOfficers for the season of 1908-1909 were<br />\nelected as follows:<br />\nFranklin B. Pedrick, '09, President.<br />\nJohn Gardner Murray, Jr., '11, Manager.<br />\nSamuel Seymour Merrick, '11, Director of<br />\nMandolins.<br />\nThomas DeC. Ruth, graduate, Director of<br />\nGlee Club.<br />\nThe assistant-managership is still open. A<br />\nperson, it is hoped of the freshman class, will<br />\nbe picked to fill this office. All members wishing to try for the position are requested to<br />\nhand their names to the manager,P.O.Box 403.<br />\nIt is hoped that the interest shown by the<br />\nfreshmen at this meeting will not die out, but<br />\nthat they will awake to the fact that -if you<br />\nwant to have fun\" come out for the musical<br />\nclubs. Every one present Wednesday seemed<br />\nto be in for the welfare of the club. The general speech was -Let's have another Woman's<br />\nCollege concert and some trips.\"<br />\nThe Manager has already started to make<br />\narrangements for a joint concert with the Woman's College, and it is not improbable that<br />\nsuch a concert will be arranged with the University of Virginia. In addition to these two<br />\nlarge affairs he has promised to arrange for<br />\nseveral trips. It is to be hoped that he will<br />\nnot forget National Park, Annapolis, Easton,<br />\nCambridge, Sykesville, Hagerstown, Frederick, and last, but not least, Waterbury. So far<br />\nevery prospect for the season is a bright one.<br />\nGood attendance at the first meeting, great<br />\ninterest manifested, and all old bills paid, bid<br />\nfair to make this season one of the brightest in<br />\nthe history of the Clubs.

The<br />\ngood record made by the team this year has<br />\nalready been the direct cause of the receipt of<br />\nmany letters from teams of first caliber requesting games, and it looks as if the University would have one of the best schedules in<br />\nits history.<br />\nThe Athletic Board, at a special meeting,<br />\nMonday afternoon, awarded the 'Varsity<br />\n\"H\" to the following men: Captain Stockton,<br />\nChauncey Bosley, Eveleth Bridgman, \"Dick\"<br />\nMcCabe, \"Jack\" Fulton, \"Babe\" Michael,<br />\nHarvey Musser, \"Ham\" Owens, Stoney<br />\nStollenwerck, \"Doc\" Streett and \"Doc\"<br />\nBryan. \"Bill\" Tilghman, Beehler, Frey,<br />\nHuck, \"Dud\" Lawton, \"Teedy\" Lurman,<br />\n\"Billy\" Martin, Saltzer and Reaney Wolf were<br />\ngiven the \"H.

The answers to these, and<br />\nsimilar questions, depend on whether the<br />\nformer strong college spirit of the old Hopkins men was aroused; it depends on. whether<br />\nthe present students at Johns Hopkins have<br />\ncalled forth enthusiasm with enthusiasm. You<br />\nprobably think that it is too late to take up<br />\nthis last phase of the matter, that we have<br />\nshown as much spirit as we could, and that<br />\nwe can only wait passively for the result. It<br />\nis too late to actually catch the attention of<br />\nthe Alumni, but is that any sort of a reason<br />\nwhy we should remain idle? Do you really<br />\nthink we have done our best?

Girvin Peters, '98.<br />\nV<br />\nThe music is very snappy, and is well arranged for the piano. The<br />\nv \u2022<br />\n\u2022v<br />\nsentiment of the song is good, having one verse suitable for the football season and one for the lacrosse season. We have needed just<br />\nsuch a song, because \"Veritas Vos Liberabit\" is too serious and<br />\n\u2022 l\u2022 ivinorviiroing* \u2022<br />\ndignified to be sung at an athletic event, and neither ''Rah, for Black<br />\nand Blue!\" nor '`Our Alma Mater in Dixie Land\" are suitable for a<br />\nfootball or lacrosse game. Another objection to all of our old songs,<br />\nis that the music is written merely for the harmony and not so that it can be played to<br />\nadvantage on the piano. This is the second song that Mr. Peters has contributed to Hopkins,<br />\nhaving written both the words and music to \"Rah, for Black and Blue!\" which has become so<br />\npopular. On behalf of the students, we wish to thank Mr. Peters for giving us such a splendid song, and to urge him to continue to contribute songs and marches to Hopkins. We<br />\nregret that there is apparently no other Hopkins man who is capable of producing such admirable songs, but since such is the case, we shall have to depend upon Mr. Peters's genius to<br />\nsupply us with new songs for several years to come.<br />\n\u20140..1r2119<br /><br />\n412.4 11.<br />\nr<br />\ntr\u2022-----7-,<br />\nLtstti<br />\n1111<br />\nst n n n n nn ii n<br />\nn<br />\nx<br />\nli.<br /><br />\nN the last issue of THE NEWS-LETTER we offered a prize for the best<br />\ncover design, which should be submitted to the Board of Editors be,<br />\nfore December first.

We ary trying to get a new design for our<br />\ncover, not because we think the design which has been used for the past three or four years,<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br /><br />\n3<br /><br />\nand which was drawn by an old student, Thomas Owings, can be improved upon, but merely<br />\nbecause his design has been used so long, that we think it should be given a rest for<br />\nsome time. We think that the one which we have selected will have just as successful a run<br />\nas did the old design.<br /><br />\n,firrir 4-<br /><br />\nT seems that at last Hopkins is to have a Dramatic Club. This is not<br />\njust mere rumor, as it has been for the past five or six years, but is an<br />\nactual fact. This year the matter was undertaken very quietly by<br />\ntwo<br />\nor three who were greatly interested in organizing such a club,<br />\nV<br />\ninstead of calling a mass meeting as has been done every fall for at<br />\nV<br />\nleast four years past. These few men went among the students and<br />\nfound out all who were interested in dramatics, and having got<br />\n\u2022 vvvvvvvvvvv<br />\nenough men to promise to support such an enterprise, called a meeting at which officers were elected and rules drawn up. A play<br />\nwill soon be decided upon and work will be commenced. We<br />\nunderstand that there is a student who has written a comic opera, and it is quite possible<br />\nthat the club will produce this: We feel confident that the Dramatic Club will meet with<br />\nsuccess and will be assisted by several of the professors.<br />\nNo doubt, there will be many who will hoot at the idea of a Dramatic Club, but there<br />\nare always some people who will try to discourage any enterprise, until it has become<br />\nwell established and successful, and then praise it and want to be associated with it. Let this<br />\nnew organization be well supported by the students. We shall give a full account of the<br />\nmatter in our next issue.<br /><br />\n3=3=1=3<br /><br />\nOW that the reunion is over, we may ask the question: What did the<br />\nundergraduates get out of it? In the first place, they got a lot of<br />\n21 .<br />\n22<br />\nsatisfaction.<br />\nTo begin with the lowest thing, it was satisfying to<br />\n:2<br />\n22<br />\n::<br />\n11<br />\nknow that the undergraduates' brass band made more noise at the<br />\ngame than all the other three put together. We showed the city and<br />\nthe alumni, that there is more college spirit at Hopkins than any21<br />\n0.--'. z\u2022<br />\nIt<br />\nbody ever dreamed of before.

Did anybody ever see a Hopkins crowd take a defeat like that before? Not a sign of \"soreness,\" not<br />\na trace of childishness, but a fine spirit of manliness that would not be downed.<br />\nIt was something we had long been dreaming of, this day when the rising tide of<br />\nHopkins spirit should break the bounds of conservatism and overflow in some such way as<br />\nthis. All who took part in that wild demonstration on Homewood field, whether they bore<br />\nthe colors of St. John's or the Black and Blue, have something to remember with pride.<br />\nBest of all, we were given a glimpse of what it really means to the alumni to have been<br />\nHopkins men. The fact that two or three of those who came made a round-trip of six thousand miles, shows what a strong feeling they have fcr their college.<br />\nThe reunion was a revelation to the present students as well as to the alumni. Both<br />\nsides have profited by it. May both unite to give the University the full benefit of it all!<br /><br />\nCongratulations \"Ab,\" upon such a successful termination of your life of single<br />\nblessedness.<br /><br />\nTHE 'NEWS-LETTER.<br /><br />\n4<br /><br />\nTRAGEDIES IN MANUSCRIPTS.<br />\nCHARLES M. ANDREWS.<br /><br />\nHistorical science has its tragedies as well<br />\nas the medical sciences, but its victims are<br />\nvaluable manuscripts, not human lives. The<br />\nlong series of documentary sources, which<br />\nform the ultimate foundation upon which<br />\nhistory rests, is torn with rents and gaps that<br />\nare due to the accidents of history and the<br />\ncarelessness of human beings. The greatest<br />\nregret of the historian is for the documents<br />\nthat are lost, and his greatest hope, for the<br />\nultimate recovery of some of them. Scarcely<br />\nsixty years have passed since the preservation of historical records has been raised to<br />\nthe dignity of a separate and scientific pursuit, and their care and arrangement gained<br />\nthe attention, not only of scholars, but of<br />\ngovernments also. It is difficult to realize today how careless men have been in the treatment of documents, and how little interest<br />\nthey seem to have taken in records that are<br />\ndeemed priceless at the present time.<br />\nFor the accidents to which historical documents owe their destruction the individual<br />\ncan hardly be held responsible, except that in<br />\ngenerally neglecting to furnish suitable accommodation for records, he has rendered them<br />\nliable to destruction by fire and water, the two<br />\ngreatest enemies of the historian. Fires have<br />\nbeen the cause of the greatest tragedies in<br />\nhistorical science, and all archivists in all<br />\ncountries \u2022 have their stories of losses or of<br />\nnarrow escapes. Fires have destroyed great<br />\ncollections containing thousands of documents<br />\nor have injured the papers to such an extent<br />\nas to place them beyond the hope of repair.<br />\nSome of the fires have been the deliberate acts<br />\nof invading armies: as when the British troops<br />\nburned the Capitol in Washington in 1814, or<br />\nthe Federal troops, April 3, 1865, burned a<br />\npart of Richmond, including the Court House<br />\nin which were stored a great collections of<br />\nof ancient records. Such losses are unique<br />\nonly in their magnitude. The burning of the<br />\nBritish Custom House in London, in 1814,<br />\ncost our scholars some of the most important<br />\nmaterial for the history of colonial commerce;<br />\nthe fire which burnt to the ground the old<br />\nBanquetting Hall of Whitehall, in 1619, destroyed many books and papers of the Privy<br />\nCouncil Office, leaving a gap of twelve years<br /><br />\nin the history of that board; a fire, also in<br />\nWhitehall, in 1689 led to the loss of valuable<br />\ndepartmental papers, while the great fire of<br />\nLondon of 1666 and the burning of the Hotel<br />\nde Ville in Paris, in 1871 resulted in losses,<br />\nthe extent of which can never adequately be<br />\ndetermined. When in 1834, the Parliament<br />\nBuildings were burnt it was only by great<br />\npresence of mind that the manuscripts of the<br />\nHouse of Lords were saved. One of the<br />\ngreatest disasters in this country, though it<br />\naffected a somewhat narrower field of historical interest, occurred in 1906, when three<br />\nhundred volumes of Spanish archives of California, constituting the largest collections of<br />\nSpanish decrees, memorials, orders, and proceedings extant in the United States, were<br />\nentirely destroyed in the San Francisco earthquake and fire. It is more difficult to reconcile oneself to this loss when one remembers<br />\nthat an offer from the Library of Congress to<br />\nreceive these documents for safekeeping was<br />\nrefused in 1902 by the citizens of San<br />\nFrancisco.<br />\nMany losses have been incurred in the burning of private houses. The most famous<br />\ntragedy of this kind took place on October 23,<br />\n1731, when Ashburnham House at Westminister was burned, in which the priceless<br />\ncollection of Sir Robert Cotton was stored,<br />\nand large numbers of manuscript volumes<br />\nwere destroyed, or injured beyond repair. A<br />\nfire in the house of the historian, Mommsen,<br />\nresulted in the destruction of rare documents<br />\nloaned him by the German National Library,<br />\nfor which he and his friends were compelled<br />\nto pay many thousand marks. More recently,<br />\nabout 1890, the burning of the residence of a<br />\nGeorgia professor led to the total destruction<br />\nof a set of twenty-two volume of manuscripts<br />\nfrom British archives, which had been loaned<br />\nto him for historical purposes by the State.<br />\nFortunately these documents were only copies<br />\nand can be replaced. The sack of Thomas<br />\nHutchinson's house by a mob in Boston,<br />\nAugust 26, 1765, and the scattering of his<br />\npapers in the street, resulted in serious losses,<br />\nthrough the manuscript of his history .was in<br />\nlargest part preserved. Similarly, when the<br />\nhouse of the loyalist, Joseph Galloway, was<br />\nattacked in 1778 and his papers were scattered,<br />\nmany valuable letters, including probably<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br /><br />\nsome of Benjamin Franklin, were 'lever recovered.<br />\nLosses by fire or by mob violence are to be<br />\nregreted, but they do not arouse the exasperation of the historian, as do the losses which<br />\nhave been incurred through the indifference<br />\nor neglect of custodians. Two towns in<br />\nOnondago County, New York, burned up all<br />\ntheir old records, because they needed the<br />\nrooms in which they were stored. A superintendent of the Capitol in Nashville, Tennessee,<br />\nhad 3000 great books, relating to the State<br />\nbank and its branches, ripped from their<br />\ncovers and sold to the paper dealers, while the<br />\ncovers were sent to a filling dump. Clerks,<br />\nattendants, and even higher officials, underpaid or receiving insufficient fees for their<br />\nmaintenance, have sold the old parchments<br />\nand papers in their custody to make glue or to<br />\nbe pulped for the making of new paper. Local<br />\nVirginia historians have recorded their sentiments at the sight of numerous fragments of<br />\nseals near a paper mill to which State<br />\nemployees had been selling old documents.<br />\nA barrel of Franklin papers was recovered in<br />\nthe nick of time from a paper mill in New<br />\nJersey, and in not a few instances valuable<br />\nhistorical evidence has been obtained from the<br />\nparchment backing used in binding books of<br />\nmodern date. More Franklin papers were<br />\nrecovered some sixty years ago from a tailor's<br />\nshop in London, where the tailor was already<br />\nbeginning to use them in making his paper<br />\npatterns. Even when not deliberately sold,<br />\ndocuments in official custody have been made<br />\na quarry for the conscienceless collector. Custodians have taken advantage of their stewardship to reap some small gain from their<br />\nopportunity and have often driven hard bargains in selling either the documents them selves or the right to exploit them. As a<br />\nresult stamps have been torn off, signatures<br />\ncut out, and even complete documents purloined. The enthusiasm for 'extra-illustrating,\" for gathering autographs and holographs, and for collecting prints, stamps,<br />\nand book-marks seems to dull the human<br />\nsense of honesty. To many men and women<br />\nthe theft of a document seems but a small<br />\noffence. It has taken many years to impress<br />\nupon the world the sacredness of national<br />\narchives.<br /><br />\n5<br /><br />\nLess culpable, but no less serious, in its<br />\nconsequences was the practice which prevailed<br />\nup to very recent times of carrying off the<br />\nrecords to private houses. Early judges and<br />\ngovernment officials in England deemed court<br />\nrolls and state papers their private property,<br />\nand at the expiration of their term of office<br />\ncarried them home. Hence such records<br />\nfound their way into private collections, into<br />\nthe chests containing the family archives, or<br />\ninto the hands of the auctioneers in the great<br />\nbook-shops. This practice explains why so<br />\nmany state papers are today either in private<br />\nhands or in possession of great libraries like<br />\nthe British Museum. Hundreds of papers<br />\nthus taken were of course lost, and there are<br />\nperiods and phases of English history, notably<br />\nin the first quarter of the nineteenth century,<br />\nfor which source material is disheartingly<br />\nmeagre on account of the abstractions of official papers by persons in service under the<br />\ngovernment. George Chalmers, clerk of the<br />\nCouncil Committee of Trade, and once a lawyer in Baltimore, frequently borrowed manuscript volumes of the Board of Trade, and<br />\nmany of these he never returned, a fact that<br />\nis known from the actual record of his loans<br />\nwhich is still preserved. Of the library founded<br />\nby the munificence of Richard Whitington at<br />\nthe Guildhall three cart-loads of volumes,<br />\nall manuscripts, were lent to Protector Somerset in the reign of Edward VI, and on his<br />\ndownfall in 1552 were irrecoverably lost. Occasionally lost documents can be traced, and<br />\nthe Cecil, Harleian, Cottonian, and other<br />\ngreat private collections disclose papers that<br />\nought by right of origin to be in official<br />\ncustody.<br />\nThe gross neglect which has characterized<br />\nthe care of records in the past is one of the<br />\nleast pardonable of all the sins against the<br />\nwriting of history. Of some thirty reports<br />\nmade during the last decade upon our State<br />\narchives there is not one but contains its tale<br />\nof woe. Placed in charge of ignorant and<br />\ncareless custodians, to whom often an ancient<br />\ndocument is a useless incumbrance, valuable<br />\nrecords have been relegated to any place of<br />\ndeposit not wanted for other purposes. In<br />\ngarrets, lofts, closets, and bins, in tanks,<br />\nvaults, coal holes, and stables, these records<br />\nhave been subjected to every kind of indignity.<br /><br />\n6<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br /><br />\nThey have been drenched with water, soaked<br />\nwith the filth of leaking sewers, rotted with<br />\nthe damp and mold of underground cellars,<br />\nscattered by the wind during repairs to buildings, trodden under foot while lying in corridors used for daily passage, transformed into<br />\nfestering heaps of useless and dangerous material, ravaged by mice and vermin, and in<br />\ncases where still in use were allowed to remain<br />\nunrepaired and to be worn away bit by bit<br />\nuntil reduced to fragments too fragile and<br />\ntattered to be of service. Each one of these<br />\nstatements could be proved by an overwhelming, mass of evidence. Little wonder that<br />\npapers thus neglected are subjected to vandalism and plunder. Who can blame the janitor<br />\nthat uses such papers found in a cellar to start<br />\nhis fires, as happened in the case of the public<br />\narchives of Delaware. The blame falls on<br />\nthose in authority, who out of a mistaken<br />\nsense of economy, have failed to make any<br />\nadequate provision, in the way of housing or<br />\nstaff, for the preservation and classification of<br />\nthe papers.<br />\nBut the dark ages are passing. Urged on<br />\nby the private student and the literary worker,<br />\nand by historical associations and influential<br />\ncommittees, governments are rising to a sense<br />\nof their responsibility and to an appreciation<br />\nof the national disgrace. In great repositories<br />\nlike the Bibliotheque Nationale, the Public<br />\nRecord Office, the British Museum, and the<br />\nLibrary of Congress a document is cared for<br />\nas a thrice welcome guest. In fire-proof surroundings, on dry and commodious shelves,<br />\nbound in volumes or laid in boxes, the<br />\nneglectea and abused record has at last returned to its own. The British Museum<br />\nrejects no fragment, even though it be but a<br />\nblank paper. All great archives devote to the<br />\nrepair of documents a skill that is little short<br />\nof marvelous. Holes are filled in, rents<br />\nbrought together, ragged edges guarded, folds<br />\nironed out, fragile papers covered with linen<br />\ntissue, and then these renovated papers and<br />\nparchments are bound or filed, classified,<br />\nticketted, stamped, and arranged for convenient use. To tamper with such a document,<br />\nto tear it, mark it, or carry it away, subjects<br />\nthe guilty person to rejection from the repository. Though a great deal yet remains to be<br />\ndone in the lesser repositories, and though<br /><br />\nlarge numbers of documents of great value<br />\nstill remain in private hands constantly subject to loss, yet in the main it may be said<br />\nthat the sacredness of historical records is at<br />\nlast recognized and tlw eventual concentration of the majority of such records in safe<br />\nquarters is now only a matter of time.<br /><br />\nTo the Editor of THE NEWS-LETTER:<br />\nSIR \u2014In view of the recent discussion in<br />\nyour columns of a proposed treaty betwcen<br />\nfraternities, there are several points, I think,<br />\nwhich have not been sufficiently emphasized.<br />\nAn inter-fraternity treaty, in the first place,<br />\nmust be an agreement, made solely for the<br />\ngeneral welfare, and based on the consent al d<br />\napproval of all. It does not contemplate a<br />\nbargain by which each fraternity benefits. itself, at the expense of some other fraternity.<br />\nA treaty based solely upon the idea of force<br />\nand of penalties cannot succeed. The word<br />\n'treaty' suggests an agreement which it is to<br />\nthe interests of all to preserve, not an opportunity for the parties to that treaty to elude<br />\nits provisions. A I understand it, the general<br />\nprovisions are suggested as benefits, not as<br />\nrestrictions to be imposed and enforced through<br />\nstern penalties.<br />\nI will not admit so great a lack of confidence among ourselves that an agreement of<br />\nthis nature is impossible; nor do I believe that<br />\nthere is wanting a general feeling that an ei:d<br />\nshould be set to the recognized abuse of early<br />\npledging.<br />\nYours very truly,<br /><br />\nGEORGE E. Ross VEAZEY.<br /><br />\nFIRST STUDENT BIBLE CONFERENCE.<br />\nInspired by the gigantic forward strides of<br />\norganized student Bible study, with its revolutionary effect on the lives of individuals and<br />\ncolleges, the first International Bible Conference was called to convene at Columbus, Ohio,<br />\nOctober 22-25, to consider the further extension of Bible study in the colleges of North<br />\nAmerica. There were present 1022 delegates<br />\nrepresenting 220 institutions of the United<br />\nStates and Canada. It was a truly representative college assembly containing men prominent in the athletic, the social and the intel-<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br /><br />\nlectual , sides of college life. Members of<br />\nfaculties were among the delegates as well as<br />\namong the speakers. Realizing the college<br />\nconditions of America, as only such a body of<br />\nmen could, it goes without emphasizing that<br />\ntheir deliberations were carried on with great<br />\njudgment and wisdom. A distinctive feature<br />\nof the conference was the marvelous earnestness of spirit; the aim was not to magnify and<br />\nextend the student Bible study propaganda,<br />\nbut rather to bring some tangible force for<br />\ngoodness and greatness to the individual, to<br />\nthe college and to the nation.<br />\nThe importance of student Bible study, as<br />\nportrayed by the results of the past five years,<br />\nis no less interesting than significant. During<br />\nthe last year there were 048,882 men enrolled<br />\nin Bible classes in the colleges of North<br />\nAmerica, 33,663 of whom attended two months<br />\nor more. There were 6,740 men holding<br />\npositions of prominence in college life of 364<br />\ninstitutions, 4,022 fraternity man in 125 institutions, and 3,898 non-Christian men in<br />\n217 institutions enrolled in Bible study classes.<br />\nProbably the most striking evidence that the<br />\nstudent Bible study movement is a great and<br />\nfar-reaching propaganda destined to touch<br />\neventually every student of North America in<br />\none way or another was given by individuals<br />\nrepresenting the various colleges and schools.<br />\nCol. Lamed, of West Point, told of the<br />\nstrenuosity of life and strictness of discipline<br />\nthat the Army Cadets are forced to undergo,<br />\nand how every hour of the day, save 40 or 45<br />\nminutes, has something mapped out for them.<br />\nIn spite of this very serious handicap there<br />\nare, of the 415 cadets, 245, or about'60% enrolled in Bible study courses requiring 15 or<br />\n20 minutes of daily study. There are in<br />\nBible study 46 of 106 seniors, 5 of 10 honor<br />\nmen, the captains of baseball and football<br />\nteams, a group composed solely of football<br />\nmen, and 11 of the 18 senior cadet officers.<br />\nThe movement at Yale has increased in<br />\nthree years from 500 men in eight groups to<br />\nabout 1,000 men in ninety groups. There<br />\nare 27 dormitory classes, in fact every \"dorm\"<br />\nhas at least one, besides one in the training<br />\nhouse. At the University of Toronto, the<br />\nnumber jumped from 152 in '06\u2014'07 to 950<br />\nlast year. There were more than 700 enrolled<br />\nat the time of the Columbus conference, with<br /><br />\n7<br /><br />\nonly 200 men belonging to the Y. M. C. A.<br />\nThe University of Texas had 600 men in<br />\nclasses with twelve different fraternity groups.<br />\nAt Cornell the enrollment increased from 330<br />\nin '06\u2014'07 to 742 last year.<br />\nThe University of Illinois was the banner<br />\ncollege of America in Bible study last year,<br />\nhaving 1,050 men enrolled, with 802 attending two months or longer. There were thirteen<br />\nfraternity Bible study groups containing 300<br />\nof the 500 fraternity men. This year practically every fraternity is anxious to have a<br />\nClass, and it is confidently expected that<br />\nalmost the entire fraternity body will enroll.<br />\nThese are typical institutions and many other<br />\nequally interesting accounts could be cited.<br />\nIt is, beyond a reasonable doubt true, that<br />\nBible study among students is gathering momentum and becoming more and more a part<br />\nof student life. It can be justly asked, \"What<br />\ngood is resulting therefrom?\" \"What is the<br />\nfundamental purpose of this movement?\"<br />\nThe answer unhesitatingly comes, \"The<br />\nsymmetrical development of the college man<br />\nin his life work.\" We dub the man a \"grind\"<br />\nwho develops nothing but his mental faculties.<br />\nThe fellow who does everything else but study<br />\nwe call a \"sport\" or even some more inglorious name. The man who combines the<br />\nqualities of the \"grind\" and the \"sport\" is<br />\nknown as a \"good all-around fellow.\" Now<br />\nit is a matter of general knowledge that these<br />\nthree classes, in many cases, fail to make<br />\ngood. The reason is, lack of symmetrical development or rather lack of spirit. By spirit<br />\nI don't mean altogether bull-dog tenacity and<br />\npersistance, rather a deeper consciousness that<br />\ngives a man a constant, dignified and unaffected poise. This, to my mind, is the mission<br />\nof Bible study among college men. The study<br />\nof the Bible not only puts men in touch with<br />\nthe world's most significant personalities, but<br />\nit also reports the experience of men with<br />\nhigher powers and with that Spirit whose<br />\npresence makes them clean and strong and<br />\nnoble.<br />\nIt is a matter of the largest concern to every<br />\nman, what he is going to be to his home, his<br />\ncommunity, his State and his nation. It has<br />\nbeen proven again and again that it is totally<br />\ninsufficient for a man to simply desire to be<br />\njust and kind in his dealings with his fellows;<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br /><br />\n8<br /><br />\nin order to be so there must be some fundamental principles or creed back of that desire.<br />\nThe philosophy of Christ, as laid down in the<br />\nNew Testament, is matchless, and is so conceded by every class of mind. To what better<br />\nplace can a man go for his creed, and to what<br />\nbetter place can a nation look for the inspiration of her cleanest and best.statesmen, jurists,<br />\nfinanciers and men of affairs?<br /><br />\n\u2022 J.

M., Wednesday, November 18, 1908, in<br />\nMcCoy Hall. There were thirty men present,<br />\ntwenty-three of these were old men and the<br />\nremainder freshmen. Such an interest is a<br />\nsource of great joy to the president, and he<br />\nhopes that this attendance, as good as it is,<br />\nwill be bettered.<br />\nThe meeting was called to order by President Perce, who at once congratulated the<br />\nmembers present upon the fine attendance,<br />\nand urged upon them the necessity of having<br />\na large membership. A roll call showed that<br />\nthere were two pianists present, about four<br />\nviolinists, quite a number of mandolinists,<br />\nwhile almost everyone present claimed to be<br />\nsomething of a singer.<br />\nOfficers for the season of 1908-1909 were<br />\nelected as follows:<br />\nFranklin B.

All members wishing to try for the position are requested to<br />\nhand their names to the manager,P.O.Box 403.<br />\nIt is hoped that the interest shown by the<br />\nfreshmen at this meeting will not die out, but<br />\nthat they will awake to the fact that -if you<br />\nwant to have fun\" come out for the musical<br />\nclubs. Every one present Wednesday seemed<br />\nto be in for the welfare of the club. The general speech was -Let's have another Woman's<br />\nCollege concert and some trips.\"<br />\nThe Manager has already started to make<br />\narrangements for a joint concert with the Woman's College, and it is not improbable that<br />\nsuch a concert will be arranged with the University of Virginia. In addition to these two<br />\nlarge affairs he has promised to arrange for<br />\nseveral trips. It is to be hoped that he will<br />\nnot forget National Park, Annapolis, Easton,<br />\nCambridge, Sykesville, Hagerstown, Frederick, and last, but not least, Waterbury.

But<br />\nthese games were lost under such conditions,<br />\nthat they do not detract from the glory due<br />\nthe team. In the game with Delaware the<br />\nfield was covered with slush, and three substitutes were in the Hopkins line. No more<br />\nis needed to explain the defeat. In the game<br />\non the following Saturday, with St. John's,<br />\nall of the fates\u2014Clotho, Lachesis and Atropos<br />\n\u2014were against Hopkins.

The matter of the<br />\ncoach has been hanging for a long time, and<br />\nhis final appointment will enable Captain<br />\nBaily to get his men down to consistent work.<br />\n.Anyone who follows athletics will remember<br />\nMr. Hoffman, who can be depended on to get<br />\nout the best team possible.<br />\nMr, Seymour Merrick, '11, has been elected<br />\nmanager for the football season of 1909. The<br />\ngood record made by the team this year has<br />\nalready been the direct cause of the receipt of<br />\nmany letters from teams of first caliber requesting games, and it looks as if the University would have one of the best schedules in<br />\nits history.<br />\nThe Athletic Board, at a special meeting,<br />\nMonday afternoon, awarded the 'Varsity<br />\n\"H\" to the following men: Captain Stockton,<br />\nChauncey Bosley, Eveleth Bridgman, \"Dick\"<br />\nMcCabe, \"Jack\" Fulton, \"Babe\" Michael,<br />\nHarvey Musser, \"Ham\" Owens, Stoney<br />\nStollenwerck, \"Doc\" Streett and \"Doc\"<br />\nBryan. \"Bill\" Tilghman, Beehler, Frey,<br />\nHuck, \"Dud\" Lawton, \"Teedy\" Lurman,<br />\n\"Billy\" Martin, Saltzer and Reaney Wolf were<br />\ngiven the \"H. A. A.\" All the awards were<br />\nfor football, of course.<br />\nAnother important decision reached by the<br />\nboard was the determination to drop the Baltimore Medical College and Delaware from<br />\nthe football schedule. Delaware was dropped<br />\nbecause of the determination of the management that none but teams who are of sufficient<br />\nprominence to prove good drawing cards be<br />\nplayed. No one who saw the B. M. C. game<br />\nof Thanksgiving day, will need ask why they<br />\nwere dropped.<br /><br />\nTHE ALUMNI REUNION. WHAT OF IT?<br />\nWell, it's all over. There is one question,<br />\nthough, which should be, and is, I hope, in<br />\neveryone's mind. What has been the result?<br />\nWhat good will the reunion, so much talked<br />\nof, bring about? The answers to these, and<br />\nsimilar questions, depend on whether the<br />\nformer strong college spirit of the old Hopkins men was aroused; it depends on. whether<br />\nthe present students at Johns Hopkins have<br />\ncalled forth enthusiasm with enthusiasm. You<br />\nprobably think that it is too late to take up<br />\nthis last phase of the matter, that we have<br />\nshown as much spirit as we could, and that<br />\nwe can only wait passively for the result. It<br />\nis too late to actually catch the attention of<br />\nthe Alumni, but is that any sort of a reason<br />\nwhy we should remain idle? Do you really<br />\nthink we have done our best? If not, why<br />\nstop? Don't let's have any one ready to 'quit!\"<br />\nWe must all work harder than ever, and<br />\nwhoop things along, both to keep those of the<br />\nAlumni we have, interested, and to fight for<br />\nthe interest and backing of many more.<br /><br />\nREUNION NOTES.<br />\nNinety-two's snappy yell was heard on all<br />\noccasions:<br />\nRah, Blue!<br />\nRah, Black!<br />\nJohnny Hopkins, Ninety-two!<br />\nThe cheering and even the songs could be<br />\nheard at Roland Park, nearly a mile from<br />\nHomewood field, with such distinctness that<br />\nhearers could tell the concerted cheers from<br />\nthe spontaneous yelling.<br />\nIt would be a great stunt to perpetuate the<br />\nwar dance\" after the game as a sort of<br />\nregular custom at the St. John's football game<br />\nand at the Swarthmore lacrosse game. The<br />\nbig crowd that remained to see it this time<br />\nproves that outsiders find it interesting.<br />\nIt was far and away the largest crowd ever<br />\nseen at a Hopkins game.<br />\nEver see a Hopkins crowd take a defeat that<br />\nway before?<br /><br />\n12<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br /><br />\nSENIOR CLASS POEM.<br />\nThe 1909 Hullabaloo Board, in whose hands<br />\nthe class has placed the selection of the Class<br />\nPoem, has decided upon the following conditions:<br />\nThe competion is open only to members of<br />\nthe Class of 1909.
