All,<br />\nhowever, recognize the fact that the money<br />\nreceived from tuition and fees falls far short<br />\nof the amount necessary to support the institution, and all think with gratitude of the<br />\nman whose gift of the original endowment<br />\nmade the University possible.<br />\nColleges are proverbially needy. Even the<br />\nmost liberally endowed are continually seeking and receiving additional gifts.<br />\nHalls,<br />\nprofessorships, libraries, lecture courses are<br />\nadded from time to time, until a complex organization bearing the name of one man represents the beneficence of many. The higher<br />\nthe standard that such an institution maintains, the greater must be the endowment<br />\nwhich supports it, and the more difficult its<br />\ndevelopment and expansion becomes.<br />\nRecently the Johns Hopkins University has<br />\ntwice asked for aid, first from its friends as individuals, and later from the State. This was<br />\non account of peculiar and unusual circumstances, and no request was ever made with<br />\ngreater reason. One effect of the State aid<br />\nthus obtained was to interest the students as<br />\nwell as the people at large in the endowment<br />\nof the University. The unusual circumstances<br />\nwill soon pass away, and the trustees will find<br />\nthemselves able to carry on the work as before.<br />\nYet this is not enough. Every Hopkins<br />\nman feels that the University should be much<br />\nmore than able to pay its debts. There should<br />\nbe continual expansion along many lines. Departments already organized need more complete equipment; others should be extended<br />\ninto new fields, Some lines of work not yet<br />\n<br />\nNo. 2<br />\n<br />\nundertaken should be begun. As the number<br />\nof students increases the endowment should<br />\nbecome larger and more varied until the embarrassment of a single railroad should no<br />\nlonger seriously affect it.<br />\nFor the direct accomplishment of this, there<br />\nis little that the students can do. They can<br />\nonly be interested. Yet this interest, in the<br />\nUniversity and out of it, is the very thing<br />\nmost needed. Whatever they can do to cultivate the feeling that the University belongs<br />\nessentially to the State and city and is worthy<br />\nof their regard, will be of value. As the importance and worth of the University are appreciated at home and its needs are recognized, its wants will be supplied.<br />\nWith this thought, the subject has been introduced. Forecasts of the future are usually<br />\ninteresting; the more so in this case, because we have a firm faith that money will<br />\nconic, and expansion along lines where it is<br />\nmost needed will not be long delayed. Accordingly, President Gilman was asked to say<br />\nwhat could be done at Hopkins with the gift<br />\nof a million dollars. He answered as follows:<br />\n\"I have been asked to say in what way a<br />\nmillion of dollars could be used advantageously by the Johns Hopkins University.<br />\nUndoubtedly the best use of such a fund would<br />\nbe to invest it and employ the income only for<br />\nthe promotion of the manifold departments of<br />\nthe University, at the discretion of the trustees; but if more specific intimations are desired, I should say that the foundation of ten<br />\nprofessorships, each with a capital of $1oo,000, would be most serviceable. But as there<br />\nare many who can give smaller sums than that<br />\nwhich is referred to, I name the following as<br />\namong the wants of the University:<br />\n\"1. A generous endowment of the Library.<br />\nThis is an object to which any amount of<br />\nmoney could be directed. The gift of $5,000,<br />\nfor example, would enrich our collection with<br />\n<br />\n\f2<br />\n<br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\n<br />\nmany books that are very much needed at the<br />\nPresent time.<br />\n\"2. Aid for deserving students. If $1,000<br />\nor $2,000 could be applied annually by the<br />\ntrustees, not as honors to be won but as help<br />\nto be given to meritorious students who are<br />\nearning their own support during their academic life, the service would be very great.<br />\n\"3. I should be very glad to see an athletic<br />\nfield, where all sorts of athletic sports might<br />\nbe encouraged.\"<br />\nJ. C. F.<br />\n<br />\nUNIVERSITY INTENSION.<br />\nTHE TEACHERS' LECTURES AT HOPKINS.<br />\n<br />\nThe courses of lectures offered the school<br />\nteachers, to begin the first week of November,<br />\nwhile comprising some of the features of socalled University Extension, as a plan is more<br />\nin the direction of University 1n-tension.<br />\nUniversity men are not to go afield drumming<br />\nup an audience; the audience comes to the<br />\nUniversity. The new system is designed to<br />\nbreak down the middle wall or partition between the University and the schools of Baltimore. It is hoped, also, to raise the level of<br />\neducational work in this city by giving good<br />\nexamples of pedagogical work and representative courses in History and Science.<br />\nAnnually several courses of lectures are<br />\nthrown open to the public, but the present<br />\nseries is notable for the introduction of the<br />\nclass idea and examinations. A fee, furthermore, is for the first time charged. With admission to the lectures is included the privilege of a final written examination under University authority, with the possibility of a certificate, which, in all probability, will be of<br />\nsome real service to teachers desiring promotion.<br />\nThe Scientific Course will be directed by<br />\nProfessor Clark, but the class lectures, embracing Geologoy and Physical Geography,<br />\nwill be given chiefly by Dr. George B. Shattuck, Saturday mornings. The Historical<br />\nCourse will be guided by Professor Adams,<br />\n<br />\nwho will give a series of illustrated lectures on<br />\nthe History of 'Education, beginning with<br />\nChina. Professor Cunningham, of Cambridge, will discuss certain interesting topics<br />\nof English History, regarding the Church and<br />\nEnglish cities. Doctors Steiner and Lee, together with Professor James Schouler, will<br />\nalso contribute to the Historical series. It is<br />\nnot unlikely that Dr. Wm. T. Harris, U. S.<br />\nCommissioner of Education, will lend a hand.<br />\nHe has already promised the use of his collection of stereopticon views illustrating the history of European education. These lectures<br />\noccur Friday evenings.<br />\nThe lectures in both courses will be accompanied by printed outlines, and by questions<br />\nwhich hearers can answer at home in their<br />\nown time and in their own way. Texts will<br />\nbe assigned for home reading, as Tarr's<br />\n\"Physical Geography\" and Scott's \"Geology,\" in the scientific course.<br />\nThe project is attracting considerable attention in the city. Several societies which in<br />\nformer years have had so-called extension<br />\ncourses conducted by representatives of the<br />\nUniversity of Pennsylvania, will this winter<br />\njoin the Hopkins movement. Though the<br />\nlectures are specially for the benefit of teachers, they are, indeed, open to anyone interested in the proposed subjects.<br />\n<br />\nGRADUATE NOTES.<br />\n<br />\nAction has finally been taken on the question of social relations among the graduate<br />\nstudents. On Friday last a meeting was held,<br />\nand the Graduates' Club was organized, with<br />\nan immediate membership of over thirty from<br />\nthe various departments. The club is to be<br />\nrun on the tines of the original Johns Hopkins<br />\nUniversity Club. Rooms will be secured at<br />\nonce and particular nights will be selected for<br />\na general gathering of the clans. Students<br />\nfrom the different departments will have opportunities for forming acquaintances outside<br />\nthe narrow limits of their own department and<br />\n<br />\n\fTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\nenjoying some of the good fellowship which<br />\nwas so prominent a feature in the old Johns<br />\nHopkins Club and its predecessor, the<br />\n\"Kneipe.\" The government of the club was<br />\nmade as informal as possible, and was placed<br />\nin the hands of a board of three governors and<br />\na treasurer, all elected to \u2022serve provisionally<br />\nfor two months. Those elected were: Treasurer, William Myers; governors, St. G. L.<br />\nSioussat, W. A. Montgomery and V. A. Renouf.<br />\nDepartment work is now in full swing, and<br />\nseminaries and classes are hard at work. Most<br />\nof the new students have settled the most vexing question which first confronts them,<br />\nnamely, what selection they shall make from<br />\nthe various courses offered them. The past<br />\ntwo meetings of the Historical Seminary have<br />\nbeen unusually interesting, the first on account<br />\nof the presence of a number of former students<br />\nof the department who happened to be in<br />\ntown, and the second on account of a lecture<br />\nby Dr. Mathews, of the Geological Department, on \"Maps.\" Dr. Mathews had a number of maps to illustrate his points, and told<br />\nsome interesting facts about the different<br />\nkinds of maps, their construction, and some<br />\nof the earliest maps of North America, the<br />\nColonies and Maryland and Virginia.<br />\n<br />\nTHE COLLEGE CONGRESS.<br />\nII OUSE.<br />\n<br />\nThe Junior Class went about the organization of the House of Representatives with<br />\nsuch heartiness, dignity and dispatch, as to<br />\nmelt the stern face of the iCensor into a halo<br />\nof benediction. William P. Shriver was<br />\nelected Speaker, with James L. A. Burrell,<br />\nSpeaker pro tem. Reginald Ley McAll was<br />\nnamed clerk. The election of Alexander<br />\nVanR. Schermerhorn as sergeant-at-arms<br />\ncompleted the organization.<br />\nThe subject for debate on November ioth<br />\nis announced:<br />\nResolved, That the Monroe Doctrine does<br />\n<br />\n3<br />\n<br />\nnot apply to American activity in Europe and<br />\nthe East, but does apply to European activity<br />\nin America.<br />\nRepresentatives Anderson and Glazer will<br />\nsupport the affirmative, while Degrange and<br />\nBaetjer will advance the leading arguments on<br />\nthe negative side.<br />\nSENATE.<br />\n<br />\nThe class of '99 put on their Senatorial<br />\nrobes the 12th of October, were addressed at<br />\nlength by the 'Censor, and in a spirited session<br />\nperfected an organization on the model of the<br />\nUnited States Senate.<br />\nMr. Robert H.

U.; or box 398, Medical School<br />\nofJohns Hopkins Hospital.<br />\n<br />\nThe radical changes recently made in the<br />\nconstitution of the General Athletic Association seem to promise an era of greater usefulness for that organization. The action of the<br />\ntrustees in turning over to the Association the<br />\ntotal amount received from locker rents simplified its financial problems, and at the same<br />\ntime increased its responsibility. Since every<br />\none who uses the gymnasium contributes thus<br />\nindirectly to the Association, the provision<br />\nfor a mass-meeting, at which all without further qualification may vote for officers and<br />\ndelegates, is common justice that could not<br />\nwell be denied. At the same time such a<br />\nmeeting will serve to interest the students at<br />\nlarge, and convince them that the Association<br />\nis not merely a collection of candidates for<br />\nteams. If, however, those who do not wish<br />\nto try for places on teams, are to be further interested, the $2.00 membership fee should<br />\neither be materially reduced, or else made to<br />\nmean something to such students. At present it consists merely in permission to cast a<br />\nballot now and then in an unimportant meeting, and many naturally feel that the money is<br />\nbetter spent for admission to the games. It<br />\nis to be hoped that the officers just elected will<br />\nbe successful in awakening and maintaining<br />\nthroughout the University a vital interest in<br />\n<br />\nAgain and again the need of an athletic field<br />\nis demonstrated. The arrangement by which<br />\nthe football games are played at Electric Park,<br />\nwhile perhaps the best that could be made, is<br />\nfar from ideal. The proprietor makes liberal<br />\nconcessions, indeed, but with him it is purely<br />\na business venture. The advertising and the<br />\npatronage of other attractions arc the important factors. The amateur character of the<br />\nsport is certainly tainted somewhat when our<br />\ngames are booked, like any other attraction,<br />\nat a suburban place of amusement, on the<br />\nbasis of a percentage of receipts. When we<br />\nare able to play on our own grounds, such undesirable elements will be entirely eliminated<br />\nfrom the sport, and it will deserve and receive<br />\nheartier support. Athletics at Hopkins will<br />\nalways be hampered until we have a wellequipped field.<br />\nThere are many who have looked longingly<br />\nat the advantages offered by the regular<br />\ncourses of the University, but who, for one<br />\nreason or another, have not been able to enjoy<br />\nthem. Still others look forward to college<br />\ncourses, but are not able to undertake them<br />\nnow. Many of both these classes are teachers in the public schools of the city. For the<br />\nsake of such persons, the authorities have<br />\nplanned a new departure described in another column under the title \"University Intension.\" The plan is especially significant<br />\nbecause of its possibilities.<br />\nShould the experience of the first year warrant it, no doubt the scope of the courses will<br />\nbe widened. The advantage of this plan over<br />\nthe culture courses that are carried on by correspondence and magazine articles, is in the<br />\npersonal contact with the lecturers and the<br />\nacquaintance thus gained with University<br />\nmethods. The men in charge of the 'movement are abundantly able to make it interesting, and it is safe to predict that the courses<br />\nwill be widely appreciated.<br />\n<br />\n\fTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\nAFFAIRS OF A FORTNIGHT.<br />\nHazing at Hopkins seems to have become<br />\na tradition. This certainly ought to be a matter of thanksgiving to the Faculty--and to the<br />\nFreshmen. Whether the new Decalogue of<br />\nthe President had a subduing effect on the<br />\nJuniors, or whether that class feels it got sufficient glory out of its hippodrome performance of last winter, does not appear. But<br />\nwho can tell what a day may bring forth\u2014or<br />\na Freshman banquet!<br />\nThe College 'Congress has convened. Junior M. C's and Senior 'Senators are expanding<br />\nwith the Republic, while Freshmen are building political fences in anticipation of Congressional honors next year. That all of this<br />\nis part and parcel of a graded and required<br />\nthree years' course in Public Speaking is a<br />\nhappy and significant omen in our college life.<br />\nThe making of such a course effective, and at<br />\nthe same time interesting, has been a nut to<br />\ncrack. With accustomed painstaking Johns<br />\nHopkins seems to have hammered out the<br />\nkernel.<br />\nThe policeman is a much abused factor in<br />\nthe community. But there is a limit of endurance in every man's make-up. Rather<br />\nunfortunately two upper-classmen had to run<br />\nup against this limit the afternoon of the<br />\nPrinceton-M. A. C. game. The Squire said<br />\n\"two-fiff,\" and was immutable. Policemen<br />\nshould not be imposed upon; still, the man<br />\nof the baton and brass buttons, with his high<br />\norder of intelligence, ought to recognize that<br />\ncollege men have certain rights and privileges<br />\nof citizenship extra ordinem, and that this is<br />\nespecially true of Seniors. Of course, if there<br />\nmust be a moral:<br />\nDON'T guy the cop.<br />\nThe lunch-room has passed from the hands<br />\nof one Harris to the gentle keep of the<br />\nWoman's Industrial Exchange.

Cold lunches and scholarship seem<br />\nnot to be nearly related, but as old Dr. Johnson bluntly remarked (we thank thee, Boswell), \"I look upon it, that he who does not<br />\nmind his belly will hardly mind anything<br />\nelse.\"<br />\nThere are some men about the University<br />\nwho seem to get a good deal of satisfaction in<br />\nfinding fault with\u2014well, anything and everything. They are men who lounge at the cage<br />\ndoor, hands in pockets, and \"damn\" the athletes; the men who do not write for the NEWSLETTER, borrow another fellow's paper, and<br />\ncriticize it; in brief, they are the chronic kickers. It is too bad. Such men call for our<br />\ncommiseration. The cheerful thing to do is<br />\nto be happy. And the way to be happy is to<br />\nbe up and doing, not fault-finding.<br />\nA course in public speaking has been arranged for the graduate students. They arc<br />\nto be congratulated. It is nothing new under<br />\nthe sun: that university men are going into<br />\nprofessions and professorships without knowing how to talk. A platform lecture by a<br />\nflowering Ph. D. is too often eyed askance as<br />\nan evening of mental lassitude for the audience. Even class-room lectures have been<br />\nknown to become wearisome! May the<br />\nwords of the lusty old Poet-King early be<br />\nquoted for the graduate students: \"Let me<br />\nhear thy voice, for thy voice is sweet.\"<br />\nThe University Glee 'Club will hold its next<br />\ntrial Thursday, ,October 27. At the preliminary meeting 28 candidates were present,<br />\nand the outlook is most encouraging. Some<br />\ntime in November the final trials will be held,<br />\nand the club will be chosen.

Although it<br />\nwas the opening game of the season, the team<br />\nmade a good showing, aside from a tendency<br />\nto fumble, which several times gave the ball<br />\nto Rockhill.<br />\nAfter chasing a cow and other live stock<br />\nfrom the field, the teams lined up. Rockhill<br />\nkicked off, but Bouchelle fumbled, and was<br />\ndowned on the 15-yard line. After a few<br />\ngains by the Hopkins backs, Rockhill lost io<br />\nyards on off-side play, and from this time the<br />\nball was advanced steadily up the field. Hopkins kicked, and it was Rockhill's ball on their<br />\nm-yard line. Here our line demonstrated the<br />\nease with which they could hold their opponents, as, after being pushed back 5 yards,<br />\nRockhill lost the ball on downs. Here Hopkins fumbled, lost the ball on downs, and<br />\nRockhill gained 40 yards. In the next few<br />\nminutes the ball changed hands frequently,<br />\nuntil finally Rockhill kicked out of bounds.<br />\nHopkins now made steady gains, L. E. Griffin at last scoring a touchdown after a run of<br />\n30 yards. Hopkins punted out, but Mullen<br />\nmissed the catch. Score, 5-0. After a few<br />\nminutes' more play the half ended, with the<br />\nball in Rockhill's territory.<br />\nFrom this time on Hopkins proved that<br />\nthey were in a class by themselves, as far as<br />\nRockhill was concerned. After five minutes,<br />\nthe ball was carried up the field by E. J. Griffin, until within three yards of the goal. At<br />\nthis point Griffin was injured, but resumed his<br />\nplace, and on the next play he carried the ball<br />\nacross the line for a touchdown. Robinson<br />\nkicked goal. Score, 11-0.<br />\nRockhill kicked off, and, after a long gain<br />\nby Mullen, Underwood left the game with an<br />\n<br />\ninjured knee. Hopkins was now gaining<br />\nsteadily, and in a few minutes Guggenheimer<br />\nmade another touchdown. Hopkins punted<br />\nout, and Robinson kicked goal.<br />\nGriffin and Guggenheimer were now given<br />\nthe ball alternately, until it was far into Rockhill's territory, and then Robinson scored the<br />\nlast touchdown, and once more kicked goal.<br />\nScore, 23-0.<br />\nThe teams lined up as follows:<br />\nPositions.<br />\nROCKHILL.<br />\nJ.H.U.<br />\nSaylor<br />\nL E<br />\nLestra.<br />\nEdgerton.<br />\nLindley.<br />\nL T<br />\nStuart\u2014Smith<br />\nL G<br />\nTalbot.<br />\nUnderwood Whitman<br />\nWarfield.<br />\nAtkinson<br />\nR G<br />\nWilliams.<br />\nGriffin, L.

M. C., 0.<br />\n<br />\nAt Electric Park, on last Saturday, one of<br />\nthe best teams Hopkins ever had, defeated the<br />\nBaltimore 'Medical College in a well-played<br />\ngame. Armstrong kicked off for Hopkins;<br />\nConley caught the ball and ran, but was<br />\ndowned promptly, giving us a gain of 30 yards<br />\nto start with. This distance was steadily increased until Riggs, by a very pretty run,<br />\nscored the first touchdown. Robinson kicked<br />\ngoal. When the ball was put into play, Guggenheimer got it and made the star play of the<br />\ngame, a run of 85 yards down the field. Hopkins now started in with a rush, but an unlucky fumble gave B. M. C. the ball. The<br />\ndoctors tried hard to push through our centre, but failed to gain an inch. Guggenheimer<br />\nagain got the ball and made a run of 40 yards<br />\naround the left. Time was now called for the<br />\nfirst. half. Hopkins, 6; B. M. C., o.<br />\nThe Medical College boys kicked off, and<br />\nwe gained 25 yards. Riggs next took the ball<br />\naround right end for another touchdown,<br />\nRobinson kicking goal.<br />\n<br />\n\fTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\nWhen Hopkins caught the ball after the<br />\nkick off it was fumbled, and went to the<br />\n\"Meds.\" Now came a startling play. McFarland went through their line and blocked<br />\nDelany's kick. Hopkins got the ball, and<br />\nRiggs was pushed over the line for the third<br />\ntouchdown. Robinson again kicked goal.<br />\nWhen time was finally called, Hopkins was<br />\n15 yards from B. M. C. goal.<br />\nAlthough most of the work fell to the backs,<br />\nthe line men did well. Lindley and Smith<br />\nboth outplayed their men. Butler's game was<br />\nof the star variety. Atkinson and Bruton,<br />\nwho were put on in the second half, both<br />\nplayed excellently. The line-up was:<br />\nJ. H. U.<br />\nPositions.<br />\nL E<br />\nStewart<br />\nLindley<br />\nL T.<br />\nMcFarland<br />\nL. G<br />\nW. L. Smith<br />\n..c<br />\nAtkinson\u2014Lamson .

C., 12.<br />\n<br />\nI<br />\n<br />\nThe game played October 19 between Hopkins and the Druid Athletic Club resulted in<br />\na surprise, especially to those not closely associated with either team. Attention has been<br />\ncalled to the fact that the team which played<br />\nfor D. A. C. was composed of men from no<br />\nless than three local organizations, in which<br />\nrespect it is said the rules of the Amateur<br />\nAthletic Union suffered fracture. At all<br />\nevents, they had a well-balanced team, which<br />\nput up a good game, making very few bad<br />\nplays. The best work was done by Lawrence<br />\nand Lee.<br />\nThe Hopkins team, though good in places,<br />\nfor the most part played very poorly. The<br />\nbacks missed the ball almost every time it was<br />\npassed to them. The line, too, was very weak<br />\nat times, and should have gotten into the game<br />\nin much better style. A few men, among<br />\nthem Robinson, Smith and Guggenheimer,<br />\ndid good work for Hopkins.<br />\n<br />\n7<br />\n<br />\nTHE MASS MEETINGS.<br />\n<br />\nA meeting of the General Athletic Association was held on October 13, in Hopkins<br />\nHall. The president of the Association, Dr.<br />\nRenouf, presided. Nominations for the offices to be filled at the annual elections were<br />\nmade, and a number of amendments to the<br />\nConstitution were proposed by Mr. R. H.<br />\nGrimes. These were posted for a week, and<br />\nafter an outline had been given of the more<br />\nimportant matters to come up before the Association during the year, the meeting adjourned.<br />\nOn the 2ist another meeting was held. The<br />\namendments to the Constitution were unanimously adopted. They provide that the board<br />\nof directors shall consist of a member from the<br />\nfaculty, who shall have the power of absolute<br />\nveto; of one delegate each from the graduate<br />\ndepartment and the Medical School; of an<br />\nalumnus, not at present a member of the<br />\nUniversity; and of a secretary and a treasurer. The seniors are to have two delegates<br />\nto the board, the juniors two, and the freshmen one. All of these are to be elected at a<br />\nmass meeting to be held prior to October 15<br />\nof each year. At this first meeting all members of the University shall have the right to<br />\nvote; at the subsequent meetings, only members of the Association. Another amendment provides that no one shall hold two of<br />\nthe offices of the Association, which are open<br />\nto popular election.<br />\nThe elections resulted as follows: Faculty<br />\nmember, Dr. Rcnouf; president, William H.<br />\nMaddren ; vice-president, Thomas Fitzgerald;<br />\nsecretary, Z. M. Ballard; treasurer, R. T.<br />\nAbercrombie; graduate, G. L. Radcliffe; Medical School, C. W. Ottley; alumnus, Mr. Wm.<br />\nHilles, '89; class delegates, '99, Grimes and<br />\nKnapp; two, Schriver and Wirt; 1901,<br />\nDiggs.<br />\nFor a long time past there has been need of<br />\nmore effective cheering by supporters of the<br />\nvarious teams. The importance of this can<br />\nhardly be overestimated as an incentive to the<br />\nmen in the field to work and win games.<br />\n<br />\n\f8<br />\n<br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\n<br />\nThere has been no organized yelling for a long<br />\ntime. It was in recognition of these facts<br />\na motion was made and carried, without a dissenting voice, that Mr. Stephen Harwood<br />\nshould be appointed \"Chief Rooter,\" or leader<br />\nof cheering.<br />\nCLASS ELECTIONS.<br />\n<br />\nThe undergraduates have elected class officers for the new year. John C. French was<br />\nnamed as president by the Seniors, with<br />\nHenry Bogue as vice-president; John R.<br />\nGemmil, treasurer; Walter M. Krager, secretary; Geo. D. Davidson, poet. French led his<br />\nclass in the junior year, was elected editor-inchief of The Hullabaloo, and is editor-in-chief<br />\nof the NEWS-LETTER.<br />\nChristopher T. Clark, of Washington,<br />\nelected president of the Junior Class, has been<br />\nactive in athletics as a runner and distance<br />\njuniper. John P.

All,<br />\nhowever, recognize the fact that the money<br />\nreceived from tuition and fees falls far short<br />\nof the amount necessary to support the institution, and all think with gratitude of the<br />\nman whose gift of the original endowment<br />\nmade the University possible.<br />\nColleges are proverbially needy. Even the<br />\nmost liberally endowed are continually seeking and receiving additional gifts.<br />\nHalls,<br />\nprofessorships, libraries, lecture courses are<br />\nadded from time to time, until a complex organization bearing the name of one man represents the beneficence of many. The higher<br />\nthe standard that such an institution maintains, the greater must be the endowment<br />\nwhich supports it, and the more difficult its<br />\ndevelopment and expansion becomes.<br />\nRecently the Johns Hopkins University has<br />\ntwice asked for aid, first from its friends as individuals, and later from the State. This was<br />\non account of peculiar and unusual circumstances, and no request was ever made with<br />\ngreater reason. One effect of the State aid<br />\nthus obtained was to interest the students as<br />\nwell as the people at large in the endowment<br />\nof the University. The unusual circumstances<br />\nwill soon pass away, and the trustees will find<br />\nthemselves able to carry on the work as before.<br />\nYet this is not enough. Every Hopkins<br />\nman feels that the University should be much<br />\nmore than able to pay its debts. There should<br />\nbe continual expansion along many lines. Departments already organized need more complete equipment; others should be extended<br />\ninto new fields, Some lines of work not yet<br /><br />\nNo. 2<br /><br />\nundertaken should be begun. As the number<br />\nof students increases the endowment should<br />\nbecome larger and more varied until the embarrassment of a single railroad should no<br />\nlonger seriously affect it.<br />\nFor the direct accomplishment of this, there<br />\nis little that the students can do. They can<br />\nonly be interested. Yet this interest, in the<br />\nUniversity and out of it, is the very thing<br />\nmost needed. Whatever they can do to cultivate the feeling that the University belongs<br />\nessentially to the State and city and is worthy<br />\nof their regard, will be of value. As the importance and worth of the University are appreciated at home and its needs are recognized, its wants will be supplied.<br />\nWith this thought, the subject has been introduced. Forecasts of the future are usually<br />\ninteresting; the more so in this case, because we have a firm faith that money will<br />\nconic, and expansion along lines where it is<br />\nmost needed will not be long delayed. Accordingly, President Gilman was asked to say<br />\nwhat could be done at Hopkins with the gift<br />\nof a million dollars. He answered as follows:<br />\n\"I have been asked to say in what way a<br />\nmillion of dollars could be used advantageously by the Johns Hopkins University.<br />\nUndoubtedly the best use of such a fund would<br />\nbe to invest it and employ the income only for<br />\nthe promotion of the manifold departments of<br />\nthe University, at the discretion of the trustees; but if more specific intimations are desired, I should say that the foundation of ten<br />\nprofessorships, each with a capital of $1oo,000, would be most serviceable. But as there<br />\nare many who can give smaller sums than that<br />\nwhich is referred to, I name the following as<br />\namong the wants of the University:<br />\n\"1. A generous endowment of the Library.<br />\nThis is an object to which any amount of<br />\nmoney could be directed. The gift of $5,000,<br />\nfor example, would enrich our collection with<br /><br />\n2<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br /><br />\nmany books that are very much needed at the<br />\nPresent time.<br />\n\"2. Aid for deserving students. If $1,000<br />\nor $2,000 could be applied annually by the<br />\ntrustees, not as honors to be won but as help<br />\nto be given to meritorious students who are<br />\nearning their own support during their academic life, the service would be very great.<br />\n\"3. I should be very glad to see an athletic<br />\nfield, where all sorts of athletic sports might<br />\nbe encouraged.\"<br />\nJ. C. F.<br /><br />\nUNIVERSITY INTENSION.<br />\nTHE TEACHERS' LECTURES AT HOPKINS.<br /><br />\nThe courses of lectures offered the school<br />\nteachers, to begin the first week of November,<br />\nwhile comprising some of the features of socalled University Extension, as a plan is more<br />\nin the direction of University 1n-tension.<br />\nUniversity men are not to go afield drumming<br />\nup an audience; the audience comes to the<br />\nUniversity. The new system is designed to<br />\nbreak down the middle wall or partition between the University and the schools of Baltimore. It is hoped, also, to raise the level of<br />\neducational work in this city by giving good<br />\nexamples of pedagogical work and representative courses in History and Science.<br />\nAnnually several courses of lectures are<br />\nthrown open to the public, but the present<br />\nseries is notable for the introduction of the<br />\nclass idea and examinations. A fee, furthermore, is for the first time charged. With admission to the lectures is included the privilege of a final written examination under University authority, with the possibility of a certificate, which, in all probability, will be of<br />\nsome real service to teachers desiring promotion.<br />\nThe Scientific Course will be directed by<br />\nProfessor Clark, but the class lectures, embracing Geologoy and Physical Geography,<br />\nwill be given chiefly by Dr. George B. Shattuck, Saturday mornings. The Historical<br />\nCourse will be guided by Professor Adams,<br /><br />\nwho will give a series of illustrated lectures on<br />\nthe History of 'Education, beginning with<br />\nChina. Professor Cunningham, of Cambridge, will discuss certain interesting topics<br />\nof English History, regarding the Church and<br />\nEnglish cities. Doctors Steiner and Lee, together with Professor James Schouler, will<br />\nalso contribute to the Historical series. It is<br />\nnot unlikely that Dr. Wm. T. Harris, U. S.<br />\nCommissioner of Education, will lend a hand.<br />\nHe has already promised the use of his collection of stereopticon views illustrating the history of European education. These lectures<br />\noccur Friday evenings.<br />\nThe lectures in both courses will be accompanied by printed outlines, and by questions<br />\nwhich hearers can answer at home in their<br />\nown time and in their own way. Texts will<br />\nbe assigned for home reading, as Tarr's<br />\n\"Physical Geography\" and Scott's \"Geology,\" in the scientific course.<br />\nThe project is attracting considerable attention in the city. Several societies which in<br />\nformer years have had so-called extension<br />\ncourses conducted by representatives of the<br />\nUniversity of Pennsylvania, will this winter<br />\njoin the Hopkins movement. Though the<br />\nlectures are specially for the benefit of teachers, they are, indeed, open to anyone interested in the proposed subjects.<br /><br />\nGRADUATE NOTES.<br /><br />\nAction has finally been taken on the question of social relations among the graduate<br />\nstudents. On Friday last a meeting was held,<br />\nand the Graduates' Club was organized, with<br />\nan immediate membership of over thirty from<br />\nthe various departments. The club is to be<br />\nrun on the tines of the original Johns Hopkins<br />\nUniversity Club. Rooms will be secured at<br />\nonce and particular nights will be selected for<br />\na general gathering of the clans. Students<br />\nfrom the different departments will have opportunities for forming acquaintances outside<br />\nthe narrow limits of their own department and<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\nenjoying some of the good fellowship which<br />\nwas so prominent a feature in the old Johns<br />\nHopkins Club and its predecessor, the<br />\n\"Kneipe.\" The government of the club was<br />\nmade as informal as possible, and was placed<br />\nin the hands of a board of three governors and<br />\na treasurer, all elected to \u2022serve provisionally<br />\nfor two months. Those elected were: Treasurer, William Myers; governors, St. G. L.<br />\nSioussat, W. A. Montgomery and V. A. Renouf.<br />\nDepartment work is now in full swing, and<br />\nseminaries and classes are hard at work. Most<br />\nof the new students have settled the most vexing question which first confronts them,<br />\nnamely, what selection they shall make from<br />\nthe various courses offered them. The past<br />\ntwo meetings of the Historical Seminary have<br />\nbeen unusually interesting, the first on account<br />\nof the presence of a number of former students<br />\nof the department who happened to be in<br />\ntown, and the second on account of a lecture<br />\nby Dr. Mathews, of the Geological Department, on \"Maps.\" Dr. Mathews had a number of maps to illustrate his points, and told<br />\nsome interesting facts about the different<br />\nkinds of maps, their construction, and some<br />\nof the earliest maps of North America, the<br />\nColonies and Maryland and Virginia.<br /><br />\nTHE COLLEGE CONGRESS.<br />\nII OUSE.<br /><br />\nThe Junior Class went about the organization of the House of Representatives with<br />\nsuch heartiness, dignity and dispatch, as to<br />\nmelt the stern face of the iCensor into a halo<br />\nof benediction. William P. Shriver was<br />\nelected Speaker, with James L. A. Burrell,<br />\nSpeaker pro tem. Reginald Ley McAll was<br />\nnamed clerk. The election of Alexander<br />\nVanR. Schermerhorn as sergeant-at-arms<br />\ncompleted the organization.<br />\nThe subject for debate on November ioth<br />\nis announced:<br />\nResolved, That the Monroe Doctrine does<br /><br />\n3<br /><br />\nnot apply to American activity in Europe and<br />\nthe East, but does apply to European activity<br />\nin America.<br />\nRepresentatives Anderson and Glazer will<br />\nsupport the affirmative, while Degrange and<br />\nBaetjer will advance the leading arguments on<br />\nthe negative side.<br />\nSENATE.<br /><br />\nThe class of '99 put on their Senatorial<br />\nrobes the 12th of October, were addressed at<br />\nlength by the 'Censor, and in a spirited session<br />\nperfected an organization on the model of the<br />\nUnited States Senate.<br />\nMr. Robert H.

Returning troops from the South brought many<br />\ncases of sickness with them, and laid upon<br />\nhim heavy labors in their care.

The action of the<br />\ntrustees in turning over to the Association the<br />\ntotal amount received from locker rents simplified its financial problems, and at the same<br />\ntime increased its responsibility. Since every<br />\none who uses the gymnasium contributes thus<br />\nindirectly to the Association, the provision<br />\nfor a mass-meeting, at which all without further qualification may vote for officers and<br />\ndelegates, is common justice that could not<br />\nwell be denied. At the same time such a<br />\nmeeting will serve to interest the students at<br />\nlarge, and convince them that the Association<br />\nis not merely a collection of candidates for<br />\nteams. If, however, those who do not wish<br />\nto try for places on teams, are to be further interested, the $2.00 membership fee should<br />\neither be materially reduced, or else made to<br />\nmean something to such students. At present it consists merely in permission to cast a<br />\nballot now and then in an unimportant meeting, and many naturally feel that the money is<br />\nbetter spent for admission to the games. It<br />\nis to be hoped that the officers just elected will<br />\nbe successful in awakening and maintaining<br />\nthroughout the University a vital interest in<br /><br />\nAgain and again the need of an athletic field<br />\nis demonstrated. The arrangement by which<br />\nthe football games are played at Electric Park,<br />\nwhile perhaps the best that could be made, is<br />\nfar from ideal. The proprietor makes liberal<br />\nconcessions, indeed, but with him it is purely<br />\na business venture. The advertising and the<br />\npatronage of other attractions arc the important factors. The amateur character of the<br />\nsport is certainly tainted somewhat when our<br />\ngames are booked, like any other attraction,<br />\nat a suburban place of amusement, on the<br />\nbasis of a percentage of receipts. When we<br />\nare able to play on our own grounds, such undesirable elements will be entirely eliminated<br />\nfrom the sport, and it will deserve and receive<br />\nheartier support. Athletics at Hopkins will<br />\nalways be hampered until we have a wellequipped field.<br />\nThere are many who have looked longingly<br />\nat the advantages offered by the regular<br />\ncourses of the University, but who, for one<br />\nreason or another, have not been able to enjoy<br />\nthem. Still others look forward to college<br />\ncourses, but are not able to undertake them<br />\nnow. Many of both these classes are teachers in the public schools of the city. For the<br />\nsake of such persons, the authorities have<br />\nplanned a new departure described in another column under the title \"University Intension.\" The plan is especially significant<br />\nbecause of its possibilities.<br />\nShould the experience of the first year warrant it, no doubt the scope of the courses will<br />\nbe widened. The advantage of this plan over<br />\nthe culture courses that are carried on by correspondence and magazine articles, is in the<br />\npersonal contact with the lecturers and the<br />\nacquaintance thus gained with University<br />\nmethods. The men in charge of the 'movement are abundantly able to make it interesting, and it is safe to predict that the courses<br />\nwill be widely appreciated.<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\nAFFAIRS OF A FORTNIGHT.<br />\nHazing at Hopkins seems to have become<br />\na tradition. This certainly ought to be a matter of thanksgiving to the Faculty--and to the<br />\nFreshmen. Whether the new Decalogue of<br />\nthe President had a subduing effect on the<br />\nJuniors, or whether that class feels it got sufficient glory out of its hippodrome performance of last winter, does not appear. But<br />\nwho can tell what a day may bring forth\u2014or<br />\na Freshman banquet!<br />\nThe College 'Congress has convened. Junior M. C's and Senior 'Senators are expanding<br />\nwith the Republic, while Freshmen are building political fences in anticipation of Congressional honors next year. That all of this<br />\nis part and parcel of a graded and required<br />\nthree years' course in Public Speaking is a<br />\nhappy and significant omen in our college life.<br />\nThe making of such a course effective, and at<br />\nthe same time interesting, has been a nut to<br />\ncrack. With accustomed painstaking Johns<br />\nHopkins seems to have hammered out the<br />\nkernel.<br />\nThe policeman is a much abused factor in<br />\nthe community. But there is a limit of endurance in every man's make-up. Rather<br />\nunfortunately two upper-classmen had to run<br />\nup against this limit the afternoon of the<br />\nPrinceton-M. A. C. game. The Squire said<br />\n\"two-fiff,\" and was immutable. Policemen<br />\nshould not be imposed upon; still, the man<br />\nof the baton and brass buttons, with his high<br />\norder of intelligence, ought to recognize that<br />\ncollege men have certain rights and privileges<br />\nof citizenship extra ordinem, and that this is<br />\nespecially true of Seniors. Of course, if there<br />\nmust be a moral:<br />\nDON'T guy the cop.<br />\nThe lunch-room has passed from the hands<br />\nof one Harris to the gentle keep of the<br />\nWoman's Industrial Exchange. The new<br />\nservice, though somewhat primitive, is<br />\nprompt, and the fare is homelike .A few more<br /><br />\n;<br /><br />\n\u2022<br /><br />\n5<br /><br />\nhot dishes on the calendar would be timely; a<br />\nmodest oyster stew at popular prices would<br />\nhelp out wonderfully, for the cold lunch is a<br />\nreal demoralizer to the average student's<br />\nstomach. Cold lunches and scholarship seem<br />\nnot to be nearly related, but as old Dr. Johnson bluntly remarked (we thank thee, Boswell), \"I look upon it, that he who does not<br />\nmind his belly will hardly mind anything<br />\nelse.\"<br />\nThere are some men about the University<br />\nwho seem to get a good deal of satisfaction in<br />\nfinding fault with\u2014well, anything and everything. They are men who lounge at the cage<br />\ndoor, hands in pockets, and \"damn\" the athletes; the men who do not write for the NEWSLETTER, borrow another fellow's paper, and<br />\ncriticize it; in brief, they are the chronic kickers. It is too bad. Such men call for our<br />\ncommiseration. The cheerful thing to do is<br />\nto be happy. And the way to be happy is to<br />\nbe up and doing, not fault-finding.<br />\nA course in public speaking has been arranged for the graduate students. They arc<br />\nto be congratulated. It is nothing new under<br />\nthe sun: that university men are going into<br />\nprofessions and professorships without knowing how to talk. A platform lecture by a<br />\nflowering Ph. D. is too often eyed askance as<br />\nan evening of mental lassitude for the audience. Even class-room lectures have been<br />\nknown to become wearisome! May the<br />\nwords of the lusty old Poet-King early be<br />\nquoted for the graduate students: \"Let me<br />\nhear thy voice, for thy voice is sweet.\"<br />\nThe University Glee 'Club will hold its next<br />\ntrial Thursday, ,October 27. At the preliminary meeting 28 candidates were present,<br />\nand the outlook is most encouraging. Some<br />\ntime in November the final trials will be held,<br />\nand the club will be chosen. Mr. Louis<br />\nFisher, leader of Fisher's orchestra, is directing the club, of which Mr. Karl Jungbluth is<br />\nleader.<br /><br />\n6<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\nATHLETICS.<br />\nFOOT BALL.<br /><br />\nHOPKINS, 23; ROCKHILL, 0.<br />\nA crowd of about twenty-five rooters accompanied the football team to Ellicott City<br />\non the 15th, and witnessed the first of the long<br />\nstring of victories which the NEWS-LETTER<br />\nhopes to record for this year. Although it<br />\nwas the opening game of the season, the team<br />\nmade a good showing, aside from a tendency<br />\nto fumble, which several times gave the ball<br />\nto Rockhill.<br />\nAfter chasing a cow and other live stock<br />\nfrom the field, the teams lined up. Rockhill<br />\nkicked off, but Bouchelle fumbled, and was<br />\ndowned on the 15-yard line. After a few<br />\ngains by the Hopkins backs, Rockhill lost io<br />\nyards on off-side play, and from this time the<br />\nball was advanced steadily up the field. Hopkins kicked, and it was Rockhill's ball on their<br />\nm-yard line. Here our line demonstrated the<br />\nease with which they could hold their opponents, as, after being pushed back 5 yards,<br />\nRockhill lost the ball on downs. Here Hopkins fumbled, lost the ball on downs, and<br />\nRockhill gained 40 yards. In the next few<br />\nminutes the ball changed hands frequently,<br />\nuntil finally Rockhill kicked out of bounds.<br />\nHopkins now made steady gains, L. E. Griffin at last scoring a touchdown after a run of<br />\n30 yards. Hopkins punted out, but Mullen<br />\nmissed the catch. Score, 5-0. After a few<br />\nminutes' more play the half ended, with the<br />\nball in Rockhill's territory.<br />\nFrom this time on Hopkins proved that<br />\nthey were in a class by themselves, as far as<br />\nRockhill was concerned. After five minutes,<br />\nthe ball was carried up the field by E. J. Griffin, until within three yards of the goal. At<br />\nthis point Griffin was injured, but resumed his<br />\nplace, and on the next play he carried the ball<br />\nacross the line for a touchdown. Robinson<br />\nkicked goal. Score, 11-0.<br />\nRockhill kicked off, and, after a long gain<br />\nby Mullen, Underwood left the game with an<br /><br />\ninjured knee. Hopkins was now gaining<br />\nsteadily, and in a few minutes Guggenheimer<br />\nmade another touchdown. Hopkins punted<br />\nout, and Robinson kicked goal.<br />\nGriffin and Guggenheimer were now given<br />\nthe ball alternately, until it was far into Rockhill's territory, and then Robinson scored the<br />\nlast touchdown, and once more kicked goal.<br />\nScore, 23-0.<br />\nThe teams lined up as follows:<br />\nPositions.<br />\nROCKHILL.<br />\nJ.H.U.<br />\nSaylor<br />\nL E<br />\nLestra.<br />\nEdgerton.<br />\nLindley.<br />\nL T<br />\nStuart\u2014Smith<br />\nL G<br />\nTalbot.<br />\nUnderwood Whitman<br />\nWarfield.<br />\nAtkinson<br />\nR G<br />\nWilliams.<br />\nGriffin, L.

M. C., 0.<br /><br />\nAt Electric Park, on last Saturday, one of<br />\nthe best teams Hopkins ever had, defeated the<br />\nBaltimore 'Medical College in a well-played<br />\ngame. Armstrong kicked off for Hopkins;<br />\nConley caught the ball and ran, but was<br />\ndowned promptly, giving us a gain of 30 yards<br />\nto start with. This distance was steadily increased until Riggs, by a very pretty run,<br />\nscored the first touchdown. Robinson kicked<br />\ngoal. When the ball was put into play, Guggenheimer got it and made the star play of the<br />\ngame, a run of 85 yards down the field. Hopkins now started in with a rush, but an unlucky fumble gave B. M. C. the ball. The<br />\ndoctors tried hard to push through our centre, but failed to gain an inch. Guggenheimer<br />\nagain got the ball and made a run of 40 yards<br />\naround the left. Time was now called for the<br />\nfirst. half. Hopkins, 6; B. M. C., o.<br />\nThe Medical College boys kicked off, and<br />\nwe gained 25 yards. Riggs next took the ball<br />\naround right end for another touchdown,<br />\nRobinson kicking goal.<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\nWhen Hopkins caught the ball after the<br />\nkick off it was fumbled, and went to the<br />\n\"Meds.\" Now came a startling play. McFarland went through their line and blocked<br />\nDelany's kick. Hopkins got the ball, and<br />\nRiggs was pushed over the line for the third<br />\ntouchdown. Robinson again kicked goal.<br />\nWhen time was finally called, Hopkins was<br />\n15 yards from B. M. C. goal.<br />\nAlthough most of the work fell to the backs,<br />\nthe line men did well. Lindley and Smith<br />\nboth outplayed their men. Butler's game was<br />\nof the star variety. Atkinson and Bruton,<br />\nwho were put on in the second half, both<br />\nplayed excellently. The line-up was:<br />\nJ. H. U.<br />\nPositions.<br />\nL E<br />\nStewart<br />\nLindley<br />\nL T.<br />\nMcFarland<br />\nL. G<br />\nW. L. Smith<br />\n..c<br />\nAtkinson\u2014Lamson .

C., 12.<br /><br />\nI<br /><br />\nThe game played October 19 between Hopkins and the Druid Athletic Club resulted in<br />\na surprise, especially to those not closely associated with either team. Attention has been<br />\ncalled to the fact that the team which played<br />\nfor D. A. C. was composed of men from no<br />\nless than three local organizations, in which<br />\nrespect it is said the rules of the Amateur<br />\nAthletic Union suffered fracture. At all<br />\nevents, they had a well-balanced team, which<br />\nput up a good game, making very few bad<br />\nplays. The best work was done by Lawrence<br />\nand Lee.<br />\nThe Hopkins team, though good in places,<br />\nfor the most part played very poorly. The<br />\nbacks missed the ball almost every time it was<br />\npassed to them. The line, too, was very weak<br />\nat times, and should have gotten into the game<br />\nin much better style. A few men, among<br />\nthem Robinson, Smith and Guggenheimer,<br />\ndid good work for Hopkins.<br /><br />\n7<br /><br />\nTHE MASS MEETINGS.<br /><br />\nA meeting of the General Athletic Association was held on October 13, in Hopkins<br />\nHall. The president of the Association, Dr.<br />\nRenouf, presided. Nominations for the offices to be filled at the annual elections were<br />\nmade, and a number of amendments to the<br />\nConstitution were proposed by Mr. R. H.<br />\nGrimes. These were posted for a week, and<br />\nafter an outline had been given of the more<br />\nimportant matters to come up before the Association during the year, the meeting adjourned.<br />\nOn the 2ist another meeting was held. The<br />\namendments to the Constitution were unanimously adopted. They provide that the board<br />\nof directors shall consist of a member from the<br />\nfaculty, who shall have the power of absolute<br />\nveto; of one delegate each from the graduate<br />\ndepartment and the Medical School; of an<br />\nalumnus, not at present a member of the<br />\nUniversity; and of a secretary and a treasurer. The seniors are to have two delegates<br />\nto the board, the juniors two, and the freshmen one. All of these are to be elected at a<br />\nmass meeting to be held prior to October 15<br />\nof each year. At this first meeting all members of the University shall have the right to<br />\nvote; at the subsequent meetings, only members of the Association. Another amendment provides that no one shall hold two of<br />\nthe offices of the Association, which are open<br />\nto popular election.<br />\nThe elections resulted as follows: Faculty<br />\nmember, Dr. Rcnouf; president, William H.<br />\nMaddren ; vice-president, Thomas Fitzgerald;<br />\nsecretary, Z. M. Ballard; treasurer, R. T.<br />\nAbercrombie; graduate, G. L. Radcliffe; Medical School, C. W. Ottley; alumnus, Mr. Wm.<br />\nHilles, '89; class delegates, '99, Grimes and<br />\nKnapp; two, Schriver and Wirt; 1901,<br />\nDiggs.<br />\nFor a long time past there has been need of<br />\nmore effective cheering by supporters of the<br />\nvarious teams. The importance of this can<br />\nhardly be overestimated as an incentive to the<br />\nmen in the field to work and win games.<br /><br />\n8<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br /><br />\nThere has been no organized yelling for a long<br />\ntime. It was in recognition of these facts<br />\na motion was made and carried, without a dissenting voice, that Mr. Stephen Harwood<br />\nshould be appointed \"Chief Rooter,\" or leader<br />\nof cheering.<br />\nCLASS ELECTIONS.<br /><br />\nThe undergraduates have elected class officers for the new year. John C. French was<br />\nnamed as president by the Seniors, with<br />\nHenry Bogue as vice-president; John R.<br />\nGemmil, treasurer; Walter M. Krager, secretary; Geo. D. Davidson, poet. French led his<br />\nclass in the junior year, was elected editor-inchief of The Hullabaloo, and is editor-in-chief<br />\nof the NEWS-LETTER.<br />\nChristopher T. Clark, of Washington,<br />\nelected president of the Junior Class, has been<br />\nactive in athletics as a runner and distance<br />\njuniper. John P. Hill was chosen vice-president; Howard Baetjer, secretary; Ronald T.<br />\nAbercrombie, treasurer; William P. Shriver,<br />\nhistorian, and Carol Wight, class poet. Executive committee: James L. A. Burrell,<br />\nHarry Wright, Alex. Van R. Schermerhorn,<br />\nJames H. Brady, Jr., T. N. DeL. Purcell.<br />\nS. H. Byrne, elected president of the Freshman Class, graduated from the City College,<br />\nwhere he was prominent as a leader and organizer of the athletic interests. He is the<br />\nUniversity correspondent for the American.<br />\nThe remaining officers of the class will be<br />\nchosen at a forthcoming meeting.<br />\nHENRY P. MUTER.<br /><br />\nHenry P. Shuter, '97, a member of the famous Astor Mountain Battery of Volunteers,<br />\ndied at sea, October 17, on the transport Rio<br />\nde Janeiro, returning from Manila. Of splendid physique, Ile was the fourth selected from<br />\n400 candidates for enlistment in a competitive<br />\nexamination. Three days after the battle of<br />\nManila he wrote that his battery had served<br />\nas General Merritt's body guard, and that he<br />\nhad fought in the front ranks.
