A provocative or<br />\nchallenging statement doesn't<br />\ndisturb him, and he appears to be<br />\nespecially comfortable when<br />\ngiven the opportunity to speak<br />\nwhat is on his own mind.<br />\nDo you have a philosophy of<br />\nteaching? \"Well, I'm not a<br />\nPhilosopher.\" These preliminary<br />\nanswers are followed by<br />\nwell-thought out and impressive<br />\nelaborations: \"I'm very<br />\ninterested in teaching, and<br />\nespecially undergraduates. I like<br />\nworking with a range of<br />\nstudents\u2014those who are<br />\nintellectually oriented and also<br />\ngeneralists who are just trying to<br />\nget a well-rounded education.\"<br />\nThe fact that his sentences are<br />\nSpoken with a wonderfully<br />\nauthentic Southern accent makes<br />\nhim an even more pleasant<br />\nPerson. He's been teaching at the<br />\ncollege level for 26 years, came<br />\nto Hopkins as a full professor of<br />\neducation and psychology in<br />\n1967 from Wisconsin, and<br />\n<br />\ndoesn't mind telling his listeners<br />\nwhat he thinks of his most recent<br />\nacademic home.<br />\nMore Selective<br />\n\"I left Wisconsin because I<br />\nwanted to be at a smaller and<br />\nmore selective school.

I like the tone<br />\nof the undergraduate students,<br />\ntheir attitudes toward projects.<br />\nThey're especially good at<br />\nworking on their own,\" said<br />\nStanley.<br />\nHis own undergraduate career<br />\nwas over by the time he was 19,<br />\nand he considers his early<br />\nentrance into college as having<br />\nbeen to his advantage. But an<br />\nearly or shortened college<br />\neducation isn't necessarily good<br />\nfor everyone. \"I'm generally not<br />\nin favor of dropping either a year<br />\nout of High School or college for<br />\neveryone. That would not be<br />\nconsistent with our knowledge of<br />\nindividual differences, and<br />\nneither is a fixed 4 years.\"<br />\nProfessor Stanley's views<br />\nabout education must be taken<br />\nmore seriously than most<br />\npeoples', because his specialty is<br />\neducational and psychological<br />\n<br />\nA.C. draft clarifies<br />\nfaculty tenure rules<br />\nThe Academic Council has<br />\ndrafted a new set of tenure rules<br />\nfor the faculty of Arts and<br />\nSciences with the purpose of<br />\ntrying to get more clear and<br />\nPrecise wording.<br />\nThe new rules were finalized<br />\nDecember 13 and sent to all<br />\nfaculty members last Thursday<br />\nafter approval by the Board of<br />\nTrustees.<br />\nDean George Benton pointed<br />\nout that the wording of the old<br />\nrules, formulated in 1967, was at<br />\ntimes ambiguous. \"The existing<br />\nrules were unclear in a variety of<br />\nways, and they were not<br />\ncomplete in the sense that several<br />\nthings were left unstated. We did<br />\n.not make new rules; we've tried<br />\nto make a clarification of the<br />\nexisting rules. Substantively they<br />\nare the same.\"<br />\nThe new regulations contain a<br />\nnew paragraph which clarifies the<br />\nrules for terminating the<br />\nappointments of non-tenured<br />\nfaculty members:<br />\n\"Each member of the faculty<br />\nwith a term appointment (that is,<br />\neach member of the faculty who<br />\ndoes not have permanent tenure)<br />\nwill be notified at least 12<br />\nmonths in advance of the<br />\nexpiration of his term if he is not<br />\nto be reappointed; except that an<br />\nInstructor in his first year will be<br />\nnotified by January 15 if he is<br />\nnot to be reappointed for the<br />\nfollowing academic year.\"<br />\nPermanent Tenure<br />\nIt is now stated that neither<br />\nthe rank of Instructor or<br />\nAssistant Professor can carry<br />\npermanent tenure. Also,<br />\npart-time faculty members and<br />\nthose with the title \"Adjunct<br />\nProfessor\" or \"Lecturer\" are not<br />\neligible for tenure. Forty-four<br />\npeople with these titles are listed<br />\nin the current catalog. Biology,<br />\n<br />\nComputer Science, Sociology,<br />\nand Writing Seminars are the<br />\ndepartments with the largest<br />\nnumber of them.<br />\n<br />\ntesting. A thick textbook,<br />\nStatistical Methods in Education<br />\nand Psychology, has been based<br />\non his work, and he's now<br />\ninvolved in a multi-year research<br />\nproject concerned with<br />\nprecocious children.<br />\n\"Many private and public<br />\nschools have no facilities for<br />\nworking with the gifted; and for<br />\nmost bright, precocious<br />\nyoungsters, a straddling<br />\nmechanism is probably more<br />\ndesirable than immediate<br />\nadmission to college.\"<br />\nHe works closely with the<br />\nsmall number of junior-high aged<br />\nstudents who already have some<br />\nclasses at Hopkins. One of his<br />\ngoals is to make acceleration<br />\neasier for these exceptional<br />\nstudents in order to save them<br />\ntime, when that is desirable.<br />\nThe fact that he served for<br />\nseveral years in the organization<br />\n<br />\nDr. Julian Stanley<br />\npsychology department and<br />\ndescribes himself as being<br />\n\"comfortable\" in one now. \"I<br />\nhave no personal need or desire<br />\nfor a department of education to<br />\ndo my own work well.\"<br />\n<br />\nmiss you, Tony<br />\nWe'll\u2022<br />\nA sleepy-eyedl good ole boy<br />\nfrom Louisiana, Don Lassus, and<br />\na mop-top sharpie from<br />\nPennsylvania, Mike Weissman,<br />\nwere elected to the exalted posts<br />\nof News-Letter editor-in-chief in<br />\na viciously contested election<br />\nSunday night.

A pawn trade, and things<br />\nbegan to open up. He traded a knight for<br />\na bishop and started to put pressure on<br />\nYoung's queen. Then suddenly, there was<br />\nan audible gasp from the crowd as Young<br />\nslid his queen through a hole: Check! and<br />\nit was all over: Wong had to move the<br />\nking and Young stole his queen.<br />\nObviously overwrought, Wong played<br />\non for a few more moves, but the futility<br />\nfinally overwhelmed him and he stopped<br />\nthe clocks. With the outcome decided, all<br />\ntension subsided. After a few minutes<br />\ncompiling statistics, everyone began to<br />\ndisappear, eagerly hurrying home to seek<br />\nthe solace of a warm, comforting bed and<br />\na good night's sleep.

After this burst, Maryland<br />\ntried desperately to tie the game<br />\nagain but their hopes were denied<br />\nas the clock ran out.<br />\nThe scrimmage began<br />\ninauspiciously for the Blue Jays,<br />\nas Maryland won the opening<br />\nfaceoff and, within seventeen<br />\nseconds, whipped the first shot<br />\nby goalie Les Matthews.<br />\nComing right back, Maryland<br />\nseemed to be in control, but an<br />\n<br />\nexcellent check and the ensuing<br />\nfast break produced a Billy Nolan<br />\ngoal, tying the game for Hopkins.<br />\nMaryland then dominated the<br />\nnext six minutes of play, scoring<br />\nthree times, until Jack Thomas<br />\nwas able to break up a Club clear<br />\nwith a crunching body check.<br />\nEric Bergofsky scooped up the<br />\nloose ball and netted it on an<br />\nunassisted fast break.<br />\nA Maryland penalty late in the<br />\nperiod opened up the Blue Jay<br />\noffense, and Nolan again beat<br />\nex-Hoppie Ken Dauses on a feed<br />\nfrom Rick Kowalchuk. Seconds<br />\nlater Pat Sinram flipped to<br />\nKowalchuk, whose shot found<br />\nthe mark.<br />\nThe period ended as Matthews<br />\nmade a beautiful save on an open<br />\nMaryland shot with the score tied<br />\nat 4 each.<br />\nThe second period belonged to<br />\nHopkins. Before Maryland could<br />\nget its first rush the Blue Jays<br />\nhad scored three quick goals,<br />\nbenefitting from Kowalchuk's<br />\nstrong faceoff control.

The rules said 40<br />\nmoves for each player in an hour\u2014that is<br />\na move every minute and a half. My<br />\nopponent took off like the allowance was<br />\na second and a half. Bang! He would slap<br />\nthe button to start my clock running.<br />\nTick-tock, tick-tock (the clocks tick very<br />\nloudly, intruding on your concentration.)<br />\nBang! Bang! He just wouldn't slow down.<br />\nNearing panic myself, I managed to hold<br />\nback, to look things over. Ten minutes<br />\nand sixteen moves later, I had it<br />\nwrapped\u2014one down, three to go. We<br />\nplayed again just for fun: ten more<br />\nminutes and the poor guy decided to go<br />\nback to bed.<br />\nTrade Queens<br />\nSecond round. Sweating. I was doing<br />\ngreat! Fifteen moves and I'd already<br /><br />\nstolen a bishop and several pawns. What<br />\nto do next? All right, force him to trade<br />\nqueens. I shoved my queen forward three<br />\nsquares and let go. Oh no! He-can take it<br />\nwith his bishop! I made a wild grab, but<br />\nit was too late. Wordlessly, the man<br />\nreached over and plucked my queen from<br />\nthe board. There went round two.<br />\nAs great as my disgust was, it could<br />\nnot have matched the exhausted,<br />\nfrustrated, exasperation which Phil Wong<br />\nmust have felt when he lost his fourth<br />\nround contest for first place. Charlie<br />\nYoung played superbly, bottling Wong up<br />\nso badly that he couldn't move even<br />\nwhen he had to. Tension mounted as<br />\nboth began to worry about time trouble.<br />\nOther players, having completed their<br />\ngames, gathered round to watch the<br />\nshowdown.<br />\nWong, the favorite, took the offensive,<br />\nfighting to free himself from the<br />\nentanglement. A pawn trade, and things<br />\nbegan to open up. He traded a knight for<br />\na bishop and started to put pressure on<br />\nYoung's queen. Then suddenly, there was<br />\nan audible gasp from the crowd as Young<br />\nslid his queen through a hole: Check! and<br />\nit was all over: Wong had to move the<br />\nking and Young stole his queen.<br />\nObviously overwrought, Wong played<br />\non for a few more moves, but the futility<br />\nfinally overwhelmed him and he stopped<br />\nthe clocks. With the outcome decided, all<br />\ntension subsided. After a few minutes<br />\ncompiling statistics, everyone began to<br />\ndisappear, eagerly hurrying home to seek<br />\nthe solace of a warm, comforting bed and<br />\na good night's sleep.

The visitors remained<br />\non the offensive, looking for the<br />\ngo ahead goal, but a break in the<br />\nattack let Hopkins come up with<br />\na beautiful passing clear that<br />\nculminated in a Don Krohn<br />\nscore.<br />\nThis was followed by a<br />\nlast-minute goal by Jack Thomas,<br />\nwho succeeded in dribbling a<br />\nloose ball into the goal from a<br />\ntangle in front of the crease for<br />\nwhat proved to be the winning<br />\nscore.
