They have.<br />\nThey come, like women, in all sizes, shapes, and colors.<br />\nNowadays they go \"brrroom\" and \"honk\", and have a<br />\nnasty habit of killing people. But we, at Hopkins, won't<br />\nbother with that side of the story. Around here they<br />\ncollect like flies on rahcid meat, and the gripe of those<br />\nwho sit behind the wheel, and assistant plant manager<br />\nJoseph Geiger in particular, is that there are just too<br />\nmany of them.<br />\nBack in 1953 the campus had parking facilities for<br />\n576 automobiles, and a registration of 2094 cars. This<br />\nwas not a healthy situation. All sorts of little people<br />\nmet in various smoked-filled rooms, and emerged with<br />\nall sorts of little plans and large aspirations which would<br />\nease the parking problem. Today 815 parking spaces<br />\nserve an automobile registration.of 7,678. Without bothering to unsheath a sliderule we can say, without fear of<br />\ncontradiction, that if the 1953 problem was unhealthy the<br />\npresent one is tubercular.<br />\nThe parking commission and the administration met<br />\nrecently, and decided that the installation of parking<br />\nmeters on the Homewood lots, as a move to discourage<br />\nunnecessary parking, might be feasible. We feel that<br />\nthis plan reaks far worse than the auto dilemma itself.<br />\nFirst of all, don't the powers that be realize that the<br />\nundergraduate pocket is not a horn of plenty? Secondly,<br />\nwhen is parking on the Hopkins cdmpus by a member of<br />\nthe Hopkins community unnecessary? Thirdly, isn't it<br />\nthe right of any professor or student of this university<br />\nto park his car on the grounds of HIS university without<br />\nbeing taxed for the \"privilege\"?<br />\nWe see no remedy for this dilemma which is currently<br />\nplaguing campuses the country round. We ask that if<br />\nthe administration can dig up no answer which does not<br />\ndig into an individual's pocket that it let the situation<br />\n'stand, as problematic as it- is, until the helicopter age, or<br />\nuntil a rebirth of the era of the walking stick and the<br />\none-horse shay.<br />\n<br />\nOn Rioting<br />\nAlthough Spirit is desirable and should be encouraged, the \"spirit\" displayed Wednesday evening by half<br />\nof the dormitory is clearly unacceptable to society and<br />\nshould be regarded as such.<br />\nThe swift action of the Baltimore police in this riot<br />\nand their avowed intention to deal even more harshly<br />\nwith Any future outbreaks should make it apparent to<br />\nany prudent man that Hopkins riots should become as<br />\nextinct as the Dodo.<br />\nIn the last two riots, a total of ten students have<br />\nbeen arrested and booked. In most cases innocent bystanders have been the victims, too secure in the feeling<br />\nthat the police won't bother them because they are just<br />\nwatching. Counting on the continued leniency of the<br />\njudge in dismissing charges does not appear to be a safe<br />\ngamble in light of feeling of law enforcement officials<br />\nthat these outbreaks have to cease.<br />\nAlthough the actions of the police were far from<br />\nexemplary (beating unresisting student viciously with<br />\nnightstick, and using foul language), conviction of a<br />\npoliceman of conduct unbecoming td an officer and assault<br />\nin a riot situation is next to impossible.<br />\nInstead of leaving the campus and molesting citizens<br />\nof the community, it is suggested that this 'spirit\" be<br />\nturned into channels of true Spirit, such as support and<br />\nparticipation in Hopkins activities. This is a time when<br />\ndiscretion is the better part of valor.<br />\n<br />\nHallelujah, Amen<br />\nThe 'University Glee Club, currently a polished organization<br />\nof seventy men, inaugurated its<br />\nactivity on February 14, 1884,<br />\nwhen a group of fifteen men,<br />\neleven of them graduate students, took part in a concert in<br />\nthe antiquated Hopkins Hall.<br />\n<br />\n(1893), was published in the<br />\nHullabaloo of 1894. The \"Ode\"<br />\nwas similarly published in 1895.<br />\nA \"Johns. Hopkins University<br />\nMarch,\" composed for the class<br />\nof 1897 by Louis R. Rutter and<br />\npublished in the '97 Hullabaloo,<br />\ndoes not seem to have survived<br />\n<br />\nTradition states that the .Glee<br />\nClub is the oldest student organization to have achieved any<br />\ndegree of permanence, but the<br />\nrecords argue that the organization has fluctuated in its solidarity and only in recent years<br />\nhas it achieved a status both<br />\n<br />\nthe nineties.<br />\n<br />\npermanent and excellent.<br />\nAt the Commemoration Day<br />\nexercises in 1884, Woodrow Wilson, at that time a graduate<br />\nstudent in history and political science, Newton T. Baker,<br />\nWar,<br />\nof<br />\nWilson's Secretary<br />\nand their compatriots, introduced \"Inter Vitae\" and \"Gaudeamus\" to the Hopkins campus,<br />\nand contributed \"America\" and<br />\n\"The Star-Spangled Banner\" to<br />\nthe celebration in Lehman's Hall<br />\nin which the Maryland Historical Society marked the two hundred and fiftieth anniversary of<br />\nthe settlement of Maryland.<br />\nExistence Shortlived<br />\nThe first Club's existence was<br />\nrather short-lived; a banjo club<br />\nwas organized in 1888, and<br />\nthrough the process of either ab.sorption or disintegration, the<br />\nGlee Club's four year reign ended. In 1894, a sudden reluctance on 'the part of the banjo<br />\nplayers to practice, combined<br />\nwith a large graduation of<br />\nstring-pluckers, dissolved the organization. It was not until the<br />\nmid-nineties, when J. Girvin<br />\nPeters (1900) brought student<br />\nmusic to a new height of popularity by organizing and combining glee, banjo, and mandolin<br />\nclubs, that music at Hopkins<br />\nachieved any degree of permanence.<br />\nMeanwhile a desire that the<br />\nUniversity should have some<br />\nmusic of its own led to the writing of the \"University Ode\" by<br />\nElizabeth Ellen Starr, a member of the faculty of the Peabody Conservatory, and William<br />\nLevering Devries, (A. B. 1888;<br />\nPh.D. 1892); \"The Alma Mater,\"<br />\nwritten by John Franklin Jameson, (Ph.D. 1882) in collaboration With Edwin L. Turnbull<br />\n<br />\nDignified Works<br />\nSays John C. French in his<br />\nbook, A History of the University<br />\nfounded by Johns Hopkins,\"The<br />\ntwo odes described above were<br />\ndignified works, well suited for<br />\nuse at University convocations<br />\nand on other formal occasions<br />\nbut not what- was wanted in the<br />\ncheering section at games or for<br />\nspontaneous singing when good<br />\nfellows got tOgether.\" Therefore<br />\nin 1901 the combined musical<br />\nclubs held a contest for new<br />\nHopkins songs. Forthcoming<br />\nwere the \"Black and Blue\", \"Our<br />\nAlma Mater in Dixie Land,\" \"On<br />\nthe Line,\" and three or four<br />\nother songs which have not carried over to the present day. The<br />\nthree songs mentioned can no<br />\nlonger be heard in cheering sections or \"when good fellows get<br />\ntogether,\" but the current Glee<br />\nClub has incorporated them in<br />\nits \"Hopkins Medley.\"<br />\nFrom the turn of the Century<br />\nuntil the era of Os Steinwald,<br />\nSr., the history of the Glee Club<br />\nis a blank page. Mr. Steinwald,<br />\nthe current Director of Alumni<br />\nRelations and Director of the<br />\nStudent Music Program, became<br />\nthe student leader of the organization in 1928, and to date has<br />\ncontinued to direct musical<br />\n<br />\nactivities. To extract a section<br />\nfrom a quote of Mr. Steinwald,<br />\nfrom 1923 until the war years,<br />\nthe Glee Club \"was\".<br />\nFemale Voices<br />\nDuring the Second World War,<br />\nthe male enrollment at Hopkins<br />\nappreciably dropped. One Year,<br />\na chorus of McCoy College girls<br />\nreplaced the Club. Except for<br />\nthis one lapse, the Club existed,<br />\nthough with a shortage of male<br />\nvoices, supplementing its concert<br />\nschedule with appearances at<br />\nvarious USO's.<br />\nIn 1951, under the direction<br />\nof Mr. Emil Surposs, the Club<br />\nrecorded \"The Anniversary Disk<br />\nof Hopkins Songs\", commemorating the seventy-fifth birthday<br />\nof the University. Under his leadership, in 1947, the Club gave<br />\nits first Christmas Step sing.<br />\nwhich has since become a Part<br />\nof Hopkins tradition. Mr. Surposs left Homewood to become\u2022<br />\nthe Director of Music of the<br />\nBaltimore City school system.<br />\nHis replacement was Mr. Donald Regier, a graduate of CitY<br />\nCollege in Baltimore. The vacancy left by Regier was this Year<br />\nfilled by Mr. James Mitchell, a<br />\nvarious<br />\nmember and leader of<br />\nmusical organizations in the citY,<br />\nand an ex-Pennsylvanian of Fred<br />\nWaring fame.<br />\nSince 1955, music at Homewood has reached a peak.

They have.<br />\nThey come, like women, in all sizes, shapes, and colors.<br />\nNowadays they go \"brrroom\" and \"honk\", and have a<br />\nnasty habit of killing people. But we, at Hopkins, won't<br />\nbother with that side of the story. Around here they<br />\ncollect like flies on rahcid meat, and the gripe of those<br />\nwho sit behind the wheel, and assistant plant manager<br />\nJoseph Geiger in particular, is that there are just too<br />\nmany of them.<br />\nBack in 1953 the campus had parking facilities for<br />\n576 automobiles, and a registration of 2094 cars. This<br />\nwas not a healthy situation. All sorts of little people<br />\nmet in various smoked-filled rooms, and emerged with<br />\nall sorts of little plans and large aspirations which would<br />\nease the parking problem. Today 815 parking spaces<br />\nserve an automobile registration.of 7,678. Without bothering to unsheath a sliderule we can say, without fear of<br />\ncontradiction, that if the 1953 problem was unhealthy the<br />\npresent one is tubercular.<br />\nThe parking commission and the administration met<br />\nrecently, and decided that the installation of parking<br />\nmeters on the Homewood lots, as a move to discourage<br />\nunnecessary parking, might be feasible. We feel that<br />\nthis plan reaks far worse than the auto dilemma itself.<br />\nFirst of all, don't the powers that be realize that the<br />\nundergraduate pocket is not a horn of plenty? Secondly,<br />\nwhen is parking on the Hopkins cdmpus by a member of<br />\nthe Hopkins community unnecessary? Thirdly, isn't it<br />\nthe right of any professor or student of this university<br />\nto park his car on the grounds of HIS university without<br />\nbeing taxed for the \"privilege\"?<br />\nWe see no remedy for this dilemma which is currently<br />\nplaguing campuses the country round.

In 1894, a sudden reluctance on 'the part of the banjo<br />\nplayers to practice, combined<br />\nwith a large graduation of<br />\nstring-pluckers, dissolved the organization. It was not until the<br />\nmid-nineties, when J. Girvin<br />\nPeters (1900) brought student<br />\nmusic to a new height of popularity by organizing and combining glee, banjo, and mandolin<br />\nclubs, that music at Hopkins<br />\nachieved any degree of permanence.<br />\nMeanwhile a desire that the<br />\nUniversity should have some<br />\nmusic of its own led to the writing of the \"University Ode\" by<br />\nElizabeth Ellen Starr, a member of the faculty of the Peabody Conservatory, and William<br />\nLevering Devries, (A.

The<br />\nthree songs mentioned can no<br />\nlonger be heard in cheering sections or \"when good fellows get<br />\ntogether,\" but the current Glee<br />\nClub has incorporated them in<br />\nits \"Hopkins Medley.\"<br />\nFrom the turn of the Century<br />\nuntil the era of Os Steinwald,<br />\nSr., the history of the Glee Club<br />\nis a blank page.

The first involves the splitting of water by<br />\nsunlight absorbed by the chlorophyll-containing structures of<br />\nthe cells (the chloroplasts). This<br />\nphoto-chemical splitting yields<br />\nboth free oxygen gas\u2014which escapes into the air\u2014and hydrogen.<br />\nIn the second series of steps,<br />\nthe<br />\nhydrogen is ultimately<br />\ncombined through the action of<br />\nbiological catalysts\u2014known as<br />\nenzymes\u2014with carbon dioxyde,<br />\nthus giving rise to carbohydrates<br />\nor sugars.<br />\nDr. San Pietro, assistant<br />\nprofessor of biology in the McCollum-Pratt Institute of the<br /><br />\nJohns.
