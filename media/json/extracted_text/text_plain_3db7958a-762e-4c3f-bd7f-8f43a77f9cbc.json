You feel so<br />\nrelaxed.<br />\nWith these words hypnotist<br />\nJohn Kolisch cast his spell on<br />\ntwenty-three volunteers from the<br />\naudience, as everyone else in<br />\nShriver Hall Friday night watched in rapt anticipation.<br />\nThe volunteers stared at one<br />\nfixed spot in the ceiling, their<br />\nmouths gaping open. All the<br />\nwhile, eerie music washed over<br />\ntheir ears. The only other thing<br />\none could hear was the hypnotist's voice. Were the<br />\nvolunteers actually falling into a<br />\ntrance, or were they just play-<br />\n<br />\nacting?<br />\nKolisch, who claims to be the<br />\nworld's fastest hypnotist, had the<br />\nvolunteers under the control of<br />\nhis voice in seconds. One person<br />\nwent from being a child on a<br />\nmerry-go-round one moment to<br />\nbeing Elvis Presley the next moment, giving an unrehearsed performance of\"Love Me Tender\"<br />\nto the wild applause of the audience. \"Poof! Sleep,\" said<br />\nKolisch, and the person he had<br />\nawakened fell back into deep<br />\nsleep.<br />\nThe volunteers, open to any<br />\nand all of the hypnotist's suggestions, responded so spontaneously to Kolisch's voice as to almost<br />\nexclude the possibility that they<br />\nwere feigning hypnosis. No matter how often the audience burst<br />\ninto laughter or interrupted with<br />\ncatcalls or cheers, they continual<br />\nunfazed in the belief that they<br />\n<br />\nwere Arnold Schwarzenegger,<br />\nJohn Wayne, Madonna, or<br />\nMikhail Baryshnikov.<br />\nHypnosis revealed much about<br />\nthe volunteers' personality and<br />\ncharacter. After handing out play<br />\nmoney to the entire group,<br />\nKolisch asked,\"Who has not gotten any money?\" Stashing the<br />\nloot into their pants, their<br />\nblouses, or even their mouths, the<br />\ngreedier ones kept asking for<br />\nmore.

To one girl,<br />\nKolisch suggested that a perfect<br />\nstranger from the audience was<br />\nher favorite movie star: She flung<br />\nher arms around him and kissed<br />\nhim in an arduous embrace.<br />\nKolisch captured the entire moment with a Polaroid camera.<br />\n\"You possess a fantastic power<br />\nto perform, a storehouse of inner<br />\nstrength that is hardly ever used,\" said Kolisch.

The proposal, being submitted by Jeff DeCagna,<br />\na member of the CUS, is to expand the<br />\nnumber of departments which offer minors.<br />\nPresently, many of the language departments, Art History and Writing Seminars<br />\nhave programs for a minor.<br />\nThe minor, by indicating concentrated<br />\nstudy in an additional field, is recognition<br />\nfor efforts to expand the scope of education. It can supplement or complement the<br />\nmajor, displaying either interest and<br />\nknowledge in a broader range of subjects<br />\nor enhanced understanding of a field of<br />\nstudy through interdepartmental approach.<br />\nNaturally, a more well-rounded education should be sought, regardless of notations on a transcript. It would be a mistake,<br />\nhowever, for Hopkins not to encourage expanding a student's horizons by offering<br />\nsome acknowledgement.<br />\nWriting Seminars offers evidence that instituting a minor encourages participation<br />\nin a department. Four years ago, Writing<br />\nSems decided to go ahead with a minor.<br />\nThe requirements were set at one half of<br />\nthose for the Writing Sems major. The institution of a minor enabled students outside of the department to take Writing Sems<br />\ncourses, for in the minor program was<br />\nstipulated that minors as well as majors get<br />\nfirst crack at the courses before the rest of<br />\n<br />\nthe student body. Demand was overwhelming. The minor was removed for a year.<br />\nThough it was reinstituted under the condition that students going for the minor<br />\nwould have to compete with the rest of the<br />\nschool for courses, Writing Seminars continues to attract great numbers of students.<br />\nThe department's insightfulness into the<br />\nmentality of Hopkins students is admirable.<br />\nAlso, while encouraging many more<br />\nstudents to actively participate in the program, the department is thriving.<br />\nPerhaps it is a secondary point, but<br />\nminors also encourage a broader education<br />\nby making it easier to do so. Students are<br />\nenticed to double major largely to satisfy<br />\ntheir own interests, but also to show that<br />\nthey have tried to broaden themselves<br />\n(although the recognition of a notation on<br />\none's transcript is, in this regard, unsatisfactory). The attempt to double major<br />\nis a great strain\u2014and so potentially<br />\ndetrimental to an undergraduate career. Offering minors gives the opportunity to<br />\nrelieve some of the pressure, since there are<br />\nfewer requirements.<br />\nWhile the proposal includes recommendations which bear close scrutiny, the inherent logic of the minor should push it to<br />\napproval. The proposal calls for institution<br />\nof the minor's programs as of September,<br />\n1988. Given prudent execution by the CUS,<br />\nand subsequently by the Programs Committees of the academic departments, there is<br />\nno reason not to implement minors at that<br />\ntime.<br />\n<br />\nThe exam is WHEN???<br />\nA couple of weeks ago, students opened<br />\ntheir campus mailboxes to find the final exam schedules nestled among transcripts,<br />\nlecture announcements, and overdue book<br />\nnotices.<br />\nMost of us probably went home and<br />\nmarked up our calendars with final exam<br />\ndates and then proceeded to call the airlines<br />\nand schedule the earliest flight home.<br />\nIt wouldn't be until a number of weeks<br />\nlater that, as students prepare for the postThanksgiving, end-of-semester sprint, people realize the absence of a reading period.<br />\nNot only has the reading period been<br />\neliminated, but exams were scheduled ur<br />\nuntil December 23rd\u2014only two days hi-03re<br />\nChristmas.<br />\nA number of professors fo.lid these late<br />\nexam dates as distastefiL? as the students.<br />\nAs a result, they moved some of these<br />\nexams\u2014often by a week or more.<br />\nSo insult as been added to injury. Not<br />\nonly do students have no real opportunity<br />\nto propare for exams after classes end; even<br />\na normal exam schedule has been curtailed by its proximity to the Christmas holiday. Exams have been piggybacked and<br />\nhence concentrated into a schedule that is<br />\neven shorter than usual.<br />\nAlmost everyone will suffer from an<br />\nagonizing schedule this December. After<br />\nThanksgiving break, we will all return to<br />\nschool to face two more weeks of classes<br />\nimmediately followed by an intense exam<br />\n<br />\nperiod. Why? Apparently the Administration saw fit to begin classes this semester<br />\na week or so later than usual to avoid the<br />\nLabor Day ordeal. Because of this,<br />\nhowever, our semester ends later than usual<br />\nand forces the elimination of the readily,<br />\nperiod. This is a critical time for stud-tits<br />\nto adequately prepare for exams aw)polish<br />\noff term papers. With the academic<br />\npressures at Hopkins being \u201enat they are,<br />\nwe have to wonder why ON: Administration<br />\nshould choose to make things even more<br />\ndifficult- 3imply for a minor September<br />\nhowaY \u2022<br />\nWe suggest that the Administration examine the student mentality in an attempt<br />\nto schedule the semester weeks. After a<br />\nlong, hot summer, most people are eager<br />\nto return to school, see their college friends<br />\nagain, and get started in their studies again.<br />\nMany state universties begin their Fall<br />\nsemester in late August; this allows students<br />\nto be finished, exams and all, by midDecember.<br />\nThe University's yearly calendar is an intricate one; it must correspond with the<br />\nother division of the University for commencement purposes, etc. However, we<br />\nwould like the Administration to realize that<br />\nthere must be some other way to accomodate the year-long schedule without<br />\nputting additional pressure on our already<br />\nhectic semester.<br />\n<br />\nThar She Blows<br />\nby A. Lee Davis<br />\nI'm sitting at the computer with<br />\nTchaikovsky on the tape deck,<br />\nwaiting for creative inspiration.<br />\nSuddenly it begins again, a low<br />\nresonant hum that could be the<br />\nbeginning of a Gregorian chant or<br />\na Moonie mantra. In the space of<br />\na second it builds to a desperate<br />\ncry of disgust which can only<br />\nmean one thing: Lisa has found<br />\nanother roach.<br />\nEveryone in Baltimore has their<br />\nown roach story, from \"The<br />\nRoach that Ate my VCR\" to<br />\n\"1001<br />\nChocolate-covered<br />\nroaches,\" and everyone has their<br />\nown way of dealing with the buggers. Roachophobia (not the same<br />\nmalady recently suffered by<br />\nJudge Ginsburg), like fear of flying, is best overcome through<br />\ndirect confrontation. Therefore,<br />\nLisa and I do not call the exterminator, spread boric acid, or<br />\nslice cucumbers. We have a<br />\nsystematic method of dispatching<br />\nroaches, an organized procedure<br />\nany Civil Defense Agency would<br />\nbe proud of. Judging from the<br />\nmagic marker notches on my<br />\ntrusty Pony, it is quite successful.<br />\nLike a hurricane warning on<br />\nthe radio or an air-raid siren splitting the night, Lisa's alarm is<br />\nPhase One: This is not a test. If<br />\nthis were a test I wouldn't be<br />\nscreaming would I? I dash into<br />\nthe kitchen and we stare down the<br />\nevil-looking, foul-smelling<br />\ncreature from Hell. Like soldiers<br />\nin our first firelight, we are<br />\nparalyzed for a moment, then instincts and training take over and<br />\nwe snap into action.<br />\n.<br />\nThe beast has crouchedar,,three<br />\ninches of his loathsome body in<br />\n<br />\nthe far corner of the cupboard,<br />\nforcing us to an alternate<br />\nstragegy.<br />\n\"Corollary action B of Phase<br />\nTwo,\" I whisper. Lisa nods and<br />\nbegins the removal of innocent<br />\nnon-perishable goods from the<br />\nline of fire. Out come the Hunt's<br />\nTomato Paste, the Campbell's<br />\nsoup, the Cheerio's(who seem to<br />\nbe quite panic-stricken by the<br />\nepisode, not that I can blame<br />\nthem). As we get closer to our<br />\nquarry, all communications are<br />\ncut. Fly low. Radio silence.<br />\nWhen we have the bugger<br />\nisolated, Phase Two proper<br />\nbegins. I snatch the Scrub-Free<br />\nAll-Purpose (really all-purpose)<br />\nCleaner banned chemical warfare, but when it's man against<br />\nroach, when the wife, children,<br />\nand Instant Tapioca hang in the<br />\nbalance, it's no holds barred. I<br />\nswitch the directional head from<br />\nstream (kill) to spray (stun). Call<br />\nme sadistic, but I want to take my<br />\ntime with this one. Sensing my intentions, the roach makes a dash<br />\nfor a crack.

And in addition to the other things I could<br />\nbe doing, there are also many<br />\nreasons for not writing. But<br />\nwhich is the best? What is the<br />\nBest Reason for Not Writing My<br />\nArticle? A major reason is that I<br />\n<br />\nhave a test tomorrow, and only a<br />\nbonehead would waste time typing a silly article when he has a<br />\nmajor exam the next day. But in<br />\nreality the test is not all that huge,<br />\nand besides, I'm taking it<br />\nPass/Fail, and have already passed one test, so why worry?

To aid in this,<br />\nmany students will surrender<br />\ntheir meal card for a day,<br />\ndesignating their money to this<br />\n\"hunger fund.\" One of the sponsors of this program is Oxfam<br />\nAmerica. Indeed, if Oxfam<br />\nAmerica did only what it said it<br />\ndid, it might be worthwhile to<br />\ngive to it, but given the reality<br />\nthat they DON'T live up to their<br />\nclaims, giving to Oxfam is literally giving to an illusion.<br />\nThe issue is not hunger. The<br />\nissue is that Oxfam America<br />\nclaims to have no political ties<br />\nand maintains an image of a nonpolitical organization. This image<br />\nis one that exists under a shroud<br />\nof propaganda. Many people probably signed away their meal card<br />\nwithout ever knowing that Oxfam<br />\ndoes not, indeed, confine itself to<br />\nsolving hunger problems.<br />\nFortune magazine (December<br />\n12, 1983) explains some of Oxfam's other interests.

That's<br />\ntion that supports the above, then what's so great about America!<br />\ndo so; it is your money. But giving money to an organization that<br />\nasserts a nonpolitical nature and<br />\nthen proceeds to sponsor the<br />\nabove activities is nothing more<br />\nthan giving to a propagandistic illusion.

Anyone who is in that class<br />\nknows that there is hell to pay for<br />\na person caught with his or her<br />\nbryuki down. So I should be<br />\ntranslating.

The truth is that I<br />\nshould refuse to write as a sign<br />\nof protest. How many times has<br />\nthis guy written a journalistic<br />\ngem, only to have it torn asunder<br />\nand mutilated to a point at which<br />\nit is no longer recognizable before<br />\nbeing published. You, my faithful<br />\nreaders, have no idea of the<br />\nbeautiful works of art that emerge<br />\n<br />\nfrom my computer every Tuesday. They are literary masterpieces. Why do you all disagree?<br />\nBecause you only see the final<br />\nresult, after the editors have once<br />\nagain underestimated the lengths<br />\nof the articles, and haphazardly<br />\nhacked apart my column without<br />\neven checking with me to see<br />\nwhat can be cut and still leave the<br />\nessence intact. Last week's article is a fine example. The opening paragraph was a fine and daring parody of itself, but was cut<br />\nto make me sound like a blithering idiot. If that weren't enough,<br />\nthere were enough typos in the article to make a whole other page.<br />\nSo to you the reader, who after<br />\nreading this is plunged into a fury<br />\nof anger, I am making an offer.<br />\nI still have the original drafts of<br />\nall of my columns.

The name \"Oxfam\" comes from the Oxford<br />\nCommittee on Famine Relief,<br />\nfounded in England in 1942. Oxfam America, based in Boston,<br />\nwas established in 1970, and is<br />\none of seven autonomous Oxfams<br />\naround the world. Though Oxfam<br />\ndoes provide disaster relief during crises, its primary focus is on<br />\nthe sponsorship of development<br />\nprograms which build local selfreliance or to \"help people help<br />\nthemselves.\" Examples of ongoing projects in Africa are the construction of small dikes and dams<br />\nfor irrigation in various communities of Mauritania and the<br />\n<br />\nprovision of emergency suppiies<br />\nsuch as cloth and utensils for<br />\nrefugees of war in Mozambique.<br />\nIn Asia, Oxfam provides the funding for a fertilizer distribution<br />\nstation in India, and on Negros<br />\nIsland in the Phillipines, it has<br />\nestablished a small-scale coconut<br />\nprocessing unit operated by<br />\nunemployed sugar workers.<br />\nFinally, in Latin America, Oxfam<br />\nprovided support for health programs in the rural areas of El<br />\nSalvador where other medical<br />\nservices do not exist, and in Honduras, it established literacy and<br />\nagricultural training programs in<br />\nsix rural communities. In addition, with over 76 percent of its<br />\nexpenditures going directly to<br />\noverseas programs and 5.7 percent more to education in the<br />\nUnited States, Oxfam America<br />\nhas an international reputation for<br />\neconomy and efficiency.<br />\nFinally, I would like to say a<br />\nbit about the Hunger Committee<br />\nitself. In its third year, the JHU<br />\nHunger Committee is a looselyknit group of people making a<br />\nmodest effort toward an end to<br />\nworld hunger and creating an<br />\nawareness of the issue among the<br />\nmembers of the Hopkins community. Last year's fast raised<br />\nover $2000 for Manna House and<br />\nOxfam and in the spring, the<br />\nHunger Committee raised $150<br />\nselling crafts from the Third<br />\nWorld at Hopkins' annual fair.<br />\nCertainly the primary focus of<br />\nthe fast is to raise money for two<br />\nworthy organizations. But also, at<br />\nthe risk of sounding trite, the experience of fasting itself offers<br />\nstudents an exercise in human<br />\nunderstanding.

Why,one must ask, are we<br />\nsending money to Oxfam, a<br />\ndubious organization at best, and<br />\nnot standing by much more<br />\nreliable ones such as the Red<br />\nCross, C.A.R.E., or UNICEF?<br />\nEither the chaplain has not done<br />\nher homework (everyone else<br />\naround here does, why not she?)<br />\nor she is deliberately swindling<br />\nfreshmen into giving their daily<br />\nbread to a cause that they would<br />\nnot support, if they had been fully informed.<br />\nI invite Van Utt and this year's<br />\nsponsors of the Oxfam fast to<br />\ndonate next week's take to a real<br />\ncharity, about which they will fully inform the student body. While<br />\nthe CR's believe a fast to be a noble project, this one is rotten to<br />\nthe core. If the freshmen wish to<br />\nuse fasting for a more credible<br />\ncharity next year, they will<br />\nboycott Oxfam.<br />\n<br />\ncouragingly, have been approached and studied by the administration. What remains is the slow<br />\nand painful process of transforming the solutions to the addressed problems from ideas and<br />\nwords into actions.<br />\nSome steps, though, can be<br />\ntaken immediately, and it is one<br />\nsuch step that prompts my<br />\nwriting. After making such a promising start, the administration<br />\nhas once again demonstrated that<br />\nit is capable of actions so ironically amusing as to approach selfsatire: less than 2 weeks after the<br />\nrelease of the Task Force report,<br />\nthe administration closed\u2014<br />\npermanently\u2014the Grad Club, one<br />\nof the last existing universitymaintained student gathering<br />\nplaces.

In 1981 I had the opportunity to tour the Eastern Bloc.<br />\nMy family felt that it was an important part of my education, to<br />\nsee different cultures and different governments. This trip<br />\ntaught me the wonders of other<br />\ncultures as well as demonstrated<br />\nhow important personal freedom<br />\nis. Americans are unaware of this<br />\nenormous freedom.

Hewitt<br />\n<br />\nTo the Editor:<br />\nI am in complete agreement<br />\nwith the conclusion of James<br />\nLechtman's that it is wise to consider all options in the pursuit of<br />\npeace. Indeed, I had hoped that<br />\nmy letter of Nov. 6 would point<br />\nto the difficulty in accomplishing<br />\nthis desirable goal of examining<br />\nall options: potentially useful options such as SDI(or rearmament<br />\nduring World War II) are less obvious pathways toward peace and<br />\nare thus often overlooked in favor<br />\nof apparently more direct routes<br />\nsuch as international agreements.<br />\nLechtman<br />\nUnfortunately,<br />\nobscures the thrust of my remarks<br />\nby focusing attention on whether<br />\nSDI is actually effective, a question I did not directly address<br />\nbecause it is peripheral to my<br />\nargument.<br />\nIronically, in pursuing the<br />\nperipheral question of the effectiveness of SDI, Lechtman illustrates another pitfall inherent<br />\nin examining complicated issues:<br />\noversimplification. In drawing an<br />\nanalogy to SDI he indicates that<br />\nthe Maginot Line was ineffectual<br />\nin protecting France from the<br />\nhorrors of World War II. The implication that the fall of France<br />\ncan be attributed to the failure of<br />\nthe Maginot Line is an oversimplification that ignores<br />\nnumerous other factors. Any<br />\ndefensive system, be it the<br />\nMaginot Line or SDI, must be examined in the context of an<br />\noverall strategic policy, historical<br />\nsetting, etc. The complicated<br />\n<br />\nquestions surrounding the causes<br />\nof World War I, World War II,<br />\nand how best to preserve peace<br />\ntoday, are examined in detail in<br />\nan article by Donald Kagan in the<br />\nMarch 1987 issue of Commentary.

As that<br />\ngame let out, a friend and myself<br />\nhappened to be walking along<br />\nUniversity Ave. at Union<br />\nMemorial. Coming the other<br />\nway, were members of these local<br />\nhigh schools who, in their merriment, were throwing ice and<br />\nsnowballs at every person on the<br />\nstreet, including myself, my<br />\nfriend, and an elderly gent who<br />\nthey brutally bombarded and<br />\nforced into the street.<br />\nNow, this incident, in and of<br />\nitself, does not evoke a feeling of<br />\n\"racial overtone\" in me\u2014just a<br />\ncouple of kids having a little fun,<br />\nright?

In her<br />\nfirst and last paragraphs, she<br />\nstates her dislike for X-rated<br />\nmovies as a whole. Framed in this<br />\nway, why bother to read the article? How can anyone take her<br />\nopinion seriously in that context?<br />\nHow did she come to review this<br />\nfilm in the first place? (It's kind<br />\nof like asking Hitler to speak at<br />\nyour bar mitzvah, isn't it?)<br />\nThe review (surprise, surprise)<br />\nstates that the movie degraded<br />\nwomen, that the main character<br />\nwas \"constantly depicted as a<br />\nslave, subject to the needs of the<br />\nmen she serves.\" Did I see the<br />\nsame movie? Throughout the<br />\nfilm, Linda Lovelace wants sex,<br />\nactively seeks it out, and enjoys<br />\nit. When she was treated as a<br />\n\"slave\" or a \"purely sexual object\"? I don't recall (because<br />\nthere are none) any scenes of<br />\nLovelace being forced to perform<br />\nsex acts against her will. I do<br />\n<br />\nrecall, however, the image of her<br />\ndoctor-playmate begging her not<br />\nto have sex with him because he's<br />\nexhausted. They have sex,<br />\nthough, because she wants it.<br />\nWho's being used here?<br />\nAnd then there is the 'deep<br />\nanalysis' of the film. \"Marriage<br />\nis the ultimate orgasm\"?<br />\n\"Fraught with Joycean stream of<br />\nconsciousness\"? Come on. This<br />\nis a porno movie, with the<br />\nprimary goal of all porno movies:<br />\nto make a buck. 'Deep analysis'<br />\nhas no place here.

Ettle<br />\nThe Barnstormer's production<br />\nof The Fantasticks this past<br />\nweekend was not what one would<br />\nexpect from a typical musical.<br />\nThere was no overly-obnoxious<br />\ntap dancing, no specticular<br />\nlighting effects or technical<br />\nwizardry. Director Jonathan<br />\nTycko, acknowledging these<br />\nshortcomings in his program<br />\nnotes, asked his audience to<br />\n\"abandon [their] preconceptions<br />\nabout the art of musical theater<br />\nand love.\" His intentions were<br />\nhonorable, but Tycko fell<br />\nsomewhat short of his goal of<br />\nconveying the \"essence of theater<br />\nand love.\" While Fantasticks<br />\ndelivered many swashbuckling<br />\nand stunning moments, its pace<br />\nwas oftentimes too slow to engage<br />\nits audience.<br />\nFantasticks possessed all the<br />\nelements of an endearing love<br />\nstory. Matt (Michael Robinson),<br />\na young college boy, and his sixteen year old neighhbor Luisa<br />\n(Jill Austin) fall in love despite a<br />\nwall erected by their parents between<br />\nthe<br />\ntwo<br />\nhouses.<br />\nUnbeknownst to the children, the<br />\nparents, Hucklebee (Kara Stein)<br />\nand Bellomy (Sanjay Aggarwal),<br />\nbuilt the wall intending that the<br />\ntwo fall in love and eventually<br />\nmarry. \"To<br />\nmanipulate<br />\nchildren,\" says Bellomy, \"you<br />\nmerely say 'No!' \" Drawn<br />\ntogether by their parents' disapproval, Matt and Luisa fall deeply in love. Hucklebee and<br />\nBellomy then plan an elaborate<br />\nscheme in which the hired bandit<br />\nEl Gallo (Jonathan Kurtz) and his<br />\n<br />\nhenchmen<br />\nHenry (Andy<br />\nAngelino) and Mortimer(Howie<br />\nFried) stage the \"rape\" of Luisa.<br />\nEl Gallo intentionally permits<br />\nMatt to defeat him so that the boy<br />\nmay earn the favor of both<br />\nparents. The scheme is successful<br />\nand Matt and Luisa make plans to<br />\nmarry. But when Hucklebee lets<br />\nit slip that she and Bellomy planned the marriage by building the<br />\nwall and arranging the \"rape,\"<br />\nthe two children quickly lose the<br />\nmagic of their romance. Matt<br />\nleaves Luisa brokenhearted to<br />\ndiscover the world, but soon<br />\nreturns battered by his experiences. Luisa, too, is<br />\ndistraught over a failed romance<br />\nwith El Gallo. Realizing that<br />\ntheirs was a true love, Matt and<br />\nLuisa reconcile.<br />\nAlthough initially intense,<br />\nAustin quickly eased into her role<br />\nas the childish yet appealing<br />\nLuisa, charming many with her<br />\nprotrayal of the insecure, romantic girl (\"Please, God, don't let<br />\nme be normal!\"). While well cast<br />\nas Luisa, Austin, however, lacked the vocal range for some of her<br />\nsongs. He rendition of \"Much<br />\nMore\" was off key at certain<br />\ntimes and somewhat distracting to<br />\nthe audience. Austin's exuberance, nevertheless, truly<br />\nenhanced her character and made<br />\nup for her musical lapses.<br />\nAggarwal and Stein are<br />\nespecially appealing in this production as the witty, meddlesome<br />\nparents. Stein, as Matt's<br />\ndisciplined Navy mother, provides the necessary comic relief<br />\nin her believable role. Her<br />\nmusical numbers with Aggarwal,<br />\n<br />\nSuspect's<br />\nGripping Escapism<br />\nby Sandrine Tiller<br />\nYour teeth gritted, you're moving down further and further into the seat. Then you suddenly<br />\nshift forward, grabbing the seat<br />\nin front of you. Suspect keeps you<br />\nawake, and it's guaranteed you<br />\nwon't look at your watch.<br />\nSuspense is the name of the game,<br />\nand Suspect plays it well.<br />\nSuspect opens violently with a<br />\nsuicide, a murder, and a beating.<br />\nA homeless man is convicted of<br />\nwhat seems to be a straightforward murder. Cher, an overworked state defense attorney, is<br />\nassigned to represent him in<br />\ncourt. Dennis Quaid is a congressional aide who is a juror on this<br />\nhe<br />\nis<br />\nAlthough<br />\ncase.<br />\nunscrupulous in his dealings in<br />\ncongress, something about the<br />\ncase and Cher's honesty intrigues<br />\nhim. He begins to do some investigative work, following up<br />\ndetails Cher has overlooked. He<br />\ncommunicates his findings to her,<br />\nand as they both get involved in<br />\nthe investigation, their situation<br />\nbecomes more precarious (jurors,<br />\nof course, aren't supposed to be<br />\nin contact with lawyers). Naturally, they also become involved in<br />\neach other, bringing the stakes up<br />\neven higher. As more details<br />\ncome to light and the plot<br />\nberames thicker,.tension<br />\nThis movie links the harsh<br />\n<br />\nworld of the homeless with that<br />\nof the marble-topped Justice<br />\ndepartment, without ever seeming forced. It is a film about integrity, with Cher as the obvious<br />\nheroine, overworked, underpaid,<br />\nyet courageous and honest. The<br />\nbad guys are from the highceilinged, leather-chaired offices.<br />\nQuaid is the transition between<br />\nthese worlds. He is also<br />\ncourageous, like Cher, and now<br />\nhe puts his wily ways to good use.<br />\nHis investigations lead him, at<br />\nvarious points, white-faced in his<br />\ncommuter's overcoat, to where<br />\nthe homeless live. And there, the<br />\nonly thing that redeems his incongruence is his honesty.<br />\nCher plays her part well. She<br />\nis the one you warn, you cheer,<br />\nand you believe in. She is portrayed as a constant victim of injustice, saved by her integrity and<br />\nthe strength of her beliefs. It's a<br />\ncorny order, but Cher makes her<br />\ncharacter human and multi-faced<br />\nwithout becoming trite. Quaid is<br />\nsomewhat weaker in his performance, yet he has a definite<br />\nscreen presence (as exemplified<br />\nin the electrifying Big Easy). He<br />\nis intense, resourceful and never<br />\nboring, but he does get lukewarm<br />\nat times, in comparison to Cher.<br />\nThe sexual tension between the<br />\ntwo balances well with the tension<br />\n' \u2022\u2022<br />\nSee SUSPECT, page 20<br />\n<br />\nincluding \"Never Say No\" and<br />\n\"Plant a Radish\" are refreshing<br />\nand entertaining due to the upbeat<br />\nchoreography of Deidre LaBarre.<br />\nRobinson was somewhat<br />\nwooden as the smitten Matt.<br />\nThough he possesses a captivating<br />\nstage voice best heard in \"I Can<br />\nSee It,\" Robinson generated little energy or emotion toward his<br />\nlove Luisa. Many of his scenes<br />\nwere in fact stolen by the mere<br />\npresence of Jonathan Kurtz as El<br />\nGallo. Kurtz deserves much<br />\ncredit for renewing the dragging<br />\npace of the second act. He played<br />\nthe roguish El Gallo with ease and<br />\nconfidence despite a few stressful<br />\nflat notes, and also narrated the<br />\nplay with remarkable candor.<br />\nThey rhyming narratives of Edmund Rostand's script did grow<br />\ntedious, even with Kurtz's crisp<br />\ndelivery and evocative pantomimes of The Mute, played by<br />\nMary Kita. However, Kurtz<br />\nmanaged wonderfully with the<br />\nrhymes and maintained his<br />\n<br />\nenergy on stage.<br />\nThe circus-like antics of El<br />\nGallo's henchmen, Henry and<br />\nMortimer, added greatly to the<br />\nhilarity of the play. Angelino,<br />\nalthough miscast as an elderly,<br />\nhas-been actor, nonethless won<br />\nover his audience with his timely<br />\nquotations of Shakespeare. Fried,<br />\non the other hand, pushed his role<br />\na bit too much. The same<br />\nhyperactive humor and interplay<br />\nwith the audience which made<br />\nhim memorable in \"The Bald<br />\nSoprano\" was unfitting here.<br />\nYet, both Fried and Angelino<br />\nsuccessfully remained in<br />\ncharacter throughout the play<br />\nand, like Kurtz, were instrumental in keeping up the pace of the<br />\nshow.<br />\nTycko as director was too involved in setting his actors<br />\nonstage rather than creating a<br />\nmood. Oftentimes, Tycko placed<br />\nhis actors in tableaus or awkward<br />\npositions, thus reducing their interaction. As a result, Matt and<br />\n<br />\nLuisa never onced looked at one<br />\nanother in \"They Were You\"<br />\nand lacked much needed<br />\nchemistry to keep the conclusion<br />\nof the play from dragging.<br />\nAnother example was the action<br />\noffstage in \"Round and Round.\"<br />\nBy having Matt run throughout<br />\nthe audience, Tycko detracted<br />\nfrom the pivotal scene onstage<br />\nbetween Luisa and El Gallo.<br />\nHowever, the subtle aspects of<br />\nThe Fantasticks were most commendable. Music Director Paula<br />\nSteuernagel included a harp in her<br />\norchestra which created a<br />\nbrilliant, romantic atmosphere.<br />\nAlso, the delicate expressions and<br />\ngraceful movements of Kita as<br />\nThe Mute furthered the storyline<br />\nwithout disrupting either the audience or the actors. These<br />\nsubtleties made the play<br />\nmemorable and added a creative<br />\ndimension to Tycko's wholly<br />\nworthwhile production.<br />\n<br />\nLet My People ComeNon-Eroticism at Godfrey's<br />\nby Amy Reiter<br />\n<br />\npiece. . .[It] was meant to express<br />\nthe new attitude about sex.\" He<br />\nlater mourns, \"The sexual<br />\nrevolution is over. It's been<br />\nlost.\"<br />\nSeveral minor changes have<br />\nbeen made to the show, such as<br />\nthe addition of a prologue and a<br />\nfew alterations in the lyrics of the<br />\nlast number. But Earl Wilson<br />\nJr.'s original script, written in<br />\n1973, is pretty much intact. The<br />\nlast line, \"today's way of loving<br />\nneeds a new set of rules,\" is a noble, but weak stab at an up-to-date<br />\nmessage.<br />\nPhil Roy admits that his show<br />\nis easy to criticize. \"It's put<br />\nto ether easily, so it's eas to take<br />\n<br />\napart.\" Still, he gets angry with<br />\n\"tight asses\" who criticize his<br />\nshow. \"It's not for people who<br />\ntake themselves real seriously.\"<br />\nHe warns, \"Basically, you have<br />\nto leave your mind at home.\"<br />\nWho laughs? \"This is a show<br />\naimed at a little older audience. . . A young college audience is usually too worried<br />\nabout their own sexuality and getting laid to sit back and look at a show that really makes fun of<br />\nit all.\"<br />\nRoy shakes his head. \"What<br />\nare you gonna do, they're kids.<br />\nI wasn't a kid so I can't relate to<br />\nthat.\"<br />\n<br />\nLet My People Come is Producer Phil Roy's \"own little<br />\ncrusade.\" The show, playing this<br />\nmonth at Godfrey's Famous<br />\nBallroom, is a musical review<br />\ncomprised of sixteen skits looking back at the sexual revolution<br />\nof the 1960's and '70's. It contains about ten minutes of nudity<br />\nand more than a couple four-letter<br />\nwords. Roy and company have<br />\nbeen in court constantly fighting<br />\nthe various state boards who<br />\nclaim that the show is \"lewd and<br />\nimmoral.\"<br />\nPhil Roy leans across the table<br />\nin the spacious ballroom turned<br />\ncabaret and smiles.<br />\n\"I enjoy doing something that<br />\nis different whether it is against<br />\nthe law or not. . .Just the ideas of<br />\nanybody saying, 'No, you can't<br />\ndo something' gets me crazy.\"<br />\nWell, let's face it. The state<br />\nboard is wasting its time. The<br />\nhype surrounding Let My People<br />\nCome is pretty interesting. Phil<br />\nRoy himself is pretty interesting.<br />\nBut the show is not at all interesting. Oh, it gets in an occasional zinger, but those are few<br />\nand far between.<br />\nRoy assures us that the nudity<br />\nin the show \"is not in any way<br />\nerotic.\" He's absolutely right.<br />\nAnd the language? \"To use fourletter words over and over again<br />\nreduces them to an absurdity. \u2014<br />\nThat, too, is accurate. So why all<br />\nthe fuss?<br />\nAccording to Roy, \"in the<br />\n'70's when the show was written,<br />\nit was just showing what was going on around us. It was very important especially to the parents<br />\nof the children of the sexual<br />\nrevolution, because those parents<br />\nhad to deal with the sexual<br />\nrevolution through their children,<br />\nwhich was nerve wracking for<br />\nmost of them.\"<br />\nThe original purpose of the<br />\nshow has been lost to the changing times. Roy comments', \"Let<br />\nMy People Come is a period The cast of Let My People Come appearing in the buff at Godfrey's.<br />\n<br />\n\f20/NOVEMBER 20, 1987<br />\n<br />\nPhil Gochenour:<br />\n<br />\nArts Callcinchr<br />\n<br />\nThe Flip Side<br />\nHey gang, remember disco?<br />\nYeah, I know, school dances<br />\nweren't much fun during the<br />\ndisco era, but things did eventually get better. Disco is still with<br />\nus, however, in a somewhat<br />\nmutated form. The music is still<br />\nbasically the same\u2014slickly produced to the point of being a cool<br />\nslice of ice, with good healthy<br />\nchuncks of hedonism, narcissism,<br />\nand nihilism thrown in. This is<br />\nprobably because the disco scene<br />\nis still more or less the same, except nowadays people wear black<br />\nclothes and dog-chains instead of<br />\nwhite leisure suits and gold<br />\nmedallions. One thing, however,<br />\nis significantly different. Whereas<br />\nin the old days the old Moog synthesizer was about as good as it<br />\ngot (and that was pretty damn<br />\ncheezy), today we have Fairlights<br />\nand DX-7's that can make any<br />\nsound known to man, even be a<br />\nband in itself.<br />\nIndeed some bands, like the<br />\nAustralian group Icehouse, seem<br />\nto be nothing but computers,<br />\nsynths, and rack-mount effects.<br />\nStrangely enough, it seems to be<br />\nprimarily foreign bands that really go for this medium. One of the<br />\nmore interesting of these groups<br />\nis the Bolshoi, a British group that<br />\nreally knows how to use a<br />\nFairlight to do the most musical<br />\ndamage. Their new album, Lindy's Party, is a good example of<br />\n<br />\nthe cutting edge of heavily synthesized, produced-to-the-max<br />\nmusic. Everything, including the<br />\nvoice of lead vocalist Trevor Tanner, sounds as if it's being run<br />\nthrough something, which takes<br />\na lot of the emotional edge off of<br />\nthe music. This is fairly compensated for, however, by more<br />\nsnakily-grooved melodies than<br />\nyou can shake a stick at. \"Crack<br />\nin Smile,\" for example, inches<br />\nalong for two versus, slowly<br />\nbuilding up the tension, then exploding outwards into a soaring<br />\nchorus that only lets you rest for<br />\na minute before hooking you in<br />\nagain. You wanna hear a great<br />\nuse of dissonance and digital<br />\ndelay, than this is the song.<br />\n\"T.V. Man,\" one of the singles<br />\nfrom this album, is worth the<br />\nalbum price alone. This song has<br />\nit all\u2014really cool, hooky lyrics,<br />\nmighty fine guitar solos, and<br />\nTrevor Tanner's voice warbling<br />\nover at least three octaves. Check<br />\nit out gang, these guys might be<br />\nthe next hot band\u2014they might get<br />\nto do a song for \"Miami Vice\"<br />\nif they're lucky.<br />\nDon't bother with The Leather<br />\nNun, and their new album, Force<br />\nof Habit. If it tells you anything,<br />\nthis group is from Sweden, the<br />\nsame country that gave us Abba.<br />\nSure, they've got a provocative<br />\nname, they wear Russian 1Shirts, and they look like<br />\n<br />\ncharacters from Diva. They are,<br />\nhowever, boring as hell. These<br />\nguys seem to think that the best<br />\nuse a synth can be put to is the<br />\nor electronic drone. Over this is<br />\nlayered the most minimal of fuzz<br />\nguitar riffs, the most languid<br />\nrhythms I've ever heard (I think<br />\nit's supposed to sound sinister),<br />\nand lead singer Jonas Almquist's<br />\nintoning half-growled lyrics like<br />\n'I left my heart on desolation<br />\navenue/I took my soul away.<br />\nZzzzzz. . .so play something I<br />\nhaven't heard a million times<br />\nbefore.<br />\nOkay, in all fairness, not all of<br />\nit is completely bad. Probably the<br />\nmost happenin' track on this<br />\nalbum is \"Girrme, gimme,<br />\ngimme (a man after midnight)\"<br />\n(surprisingly enough, a cover of<br />\nan Abba song), which actually<br />\nmanages to rock out despite<br />\neverything else. Since this album<br />\nis a collection of singles,<br />\nhowever, you don't have to buy<br />\nthe whole album to get this one<br />\nsong. It's available on Wire<br />\nrecords, if you really feel you<br />\nmust have it, or maybe Adam<br />\nEnde will just let you tape his<br />\ncopy.<br />\nUmm, to think that the or<br />\ngloom and doom, dark-dance<br />\nscene has gone from Bauhaus and<br />\nJoy Division to this.

Bantam New Fiction,<br />\n$37.95, 438 pp.<br />\nby Mary Ginder<br />\nLife During Wartime is a terrific book. The characters have<br />\ndepth, the plot has action, the<br />\nprose is lyrical, and there is<br />\nnothing trite about it.<br />\nThe war is a Communist vs.<br />\nCapitalist conflict ranging over<br />\nmuch of Central America. The<br />\nprotagonist, David Mingolls, is a<br />\nsoldier in the American occupation army in Guatemala. This is<br />\nnot, however, a novel about combat and military strategy.<br />\nThe time is approximately the<br />\nlate 1990s. War has continued<br />\nadv-\"ced<br />\nmore<br />\nbecome<br />\ntechnologically, but ,tiew element has been adr\": the use of<br />\nelite cadres ut people with<br />\npsychic al titles who have learned ho,to exert the force of their<br />\nh.,.us over others, either to affect<br />\nemotions or to kill outright. Many<br />\nother \"futuristic\" devices are<br />\nalso present in the novel, but it<br />\nresists being classified as<br />\n\"science fiction.\"<br />\nMingolla meets a beautiful<br />\npsychic, Debora, but does not<br />\nknow that she is working for the<br />\nother side. She has dreamed of<br />\nhis death in the war and tries to<br />\nconvince him to desert, but he<br />\nrefuses. After he is recruited as<br />\na psychic by his own side, he<br />\nbecomes obsessed with the<br />\nmemory of Debora; he learns that<br />\nshe is an enemy agent and decides<br />\nto kill her. The novel is not,<br />\nhowever, a thriller and David<br />\ndoes not spend the rest of the<br />\nnovel hunting her down. (Don't<br />\nlet the blurb on the back cover<br />\nfool you.)<br />\nIn short, this is a book about<br />\nlove and war and survival. It is<br />\n<br />\nalso a book about the search to<br />\nunderstand love and war and survival. Love in this novel is not<br />\nmoonlit nights and walks on the<br />\nbeach; yes, David thinks he loves<br />\nDebora, but he has to struggle to<br />\nfind out what love means in a<br />\nworld turned upside down.<br />\nTogether they learn that there is<br />\na war behind the war, a conflict<br />\nthat has lasted centuries and taken<br />\ninnumerable lives.<br />\nThe contrast of the real and ale<br />\nfantastic is integral to Lie During Wartime. This i symbolized<br />\nby the impositior Jt the American<br />\nhigh tech f,i-ces into a region<br />\nwhere 0.; people \"were trapped<br />\nbet\u201eeen the poles of magic and<br />\nason, their lives governed by<br />\nthe politics of the ultrareal, their<br />\nspirits ruled by myths and<br />\nlegends, with the computerized<br />\nbulk of North America<br />\nabove . .<br />\nShepard's characters remain<br />\nrealistic amidst his liberal use of<br />\nthe fantastic. Their personalities<br />\nand motivations are complex and<br />\nbelievable; they think, feel, and<br />\nact in very plausible ways. At the<br />\nsame time, Shepard throws in a<br />\nlot of elements that would sound<br />\nridiculous out of context\u2014for example, killer butterflies and a<br />\ncomputer that pretends to be God.<br />\nShepard writes the kind of prose that makes you reread the<br />\nparagraph you have just finished<br />\nsimply because it was so wellwritten. His descriptions have a<br />\nlyrical, almost poetic quality to<br />\nthem that is especially powerful<br />\nin describing the horror and<br />\ndevastation of the war. The ending, in particular, is beautifully<br />\ndone.<br />\nLife During Wartime has a lot<br />\nto say about morality, but it does<br />\nnot moralize.

Bulk form refers to<br />\nmacroscopic pellets, some cm or<br />\nmm in diameter. Studies of these<br />\nlarger and more tangible ceramics<br />\nwould provide a crucial understanding to certain properties exhibited by the superconductor, including the orthorhombic structure, the order, and the oxidation<br />\nvacancy. The thin film enables<br />\ncertain measurements of the<br />\nsuperconductor such as tunneling<br />\nand proximity-effects that cannot<br />\nbe determined in the bulk form.<br />\nThese are the physical dimensions<br />\nthat are being studied to provide<br />\nperhaps a greater understanding<br />\nof the superconductor.<br />\n<br />\nWhen asked to envision the<br />\nfuture of the superconductor, Dr.<br />\nChien believeckthat the media has<br />\ngiven the publit a misleading<br />\nview of this technology. It is<br />\nalmost as if the \"Nev' Kirk Times<br />\nand other papers have led the<br />\npublic to believe that the application of the superconductor is just<br />\naround the corner.\" Dr. Chien<br />\nexplains that materials which can<br />\nconduct at temperatures much<br />\nhigher than 90 degrees Kelvin are<br />\navailable but one must understand<br />\nthat in order for the superconductor to be useful in devices it must<br />\nsurvive certain stringent criteria.<br />\nDumping the material in water or<br />\nexposing it to humidity, for example, would immediately terminate the superconducting properties. A second problem arises<br />\nwith the internal degradation of<br />\nthe superconductor. As the<br />\nceramic material is composed of<br />\noxides, there inevitably will be<br />\nsome decomposition\u2014the life expectancy of the materials are<br />\ntherefore unknown.<br />\nAnother stumbling block<br />\ntoward the actual implementation<br />\nof the superconductor lies in its<br />\nform. Many perceive the use of<br />\na superconducting wire to carry<br />\nthe current, but again Dr. Chien<br />\nsuggests that presently such a<br />\n<br />\nwire would be too low in density. One must realize that superconducting material is much like<br />\na fine powder or grain. Though<br />\neach separate grain may have<br />\nideal properties, when put<br />\ntogether the conductivity may be<br />\nwcakened considerably.

Not only are there no seniors,<br />\nbut there are seven freshmen and two<br />\nsophomores that sat out last season. Greg<br />\nGold, another sophomore, transferred<br />\nfrom Lafayette in the middle of last season<br />\nand played only three games for the Jays.<br />\nIt would seem thqt youth and inexperience might keep Hopkins from im-<br />\n<br />\nJOE SHIBER\u2014Sophomore,<br />\nHeight: 6-6, Weight: 210,<br />\nHometown: Baltimore, MD,<br />\nHigh School, Loyola<br />\nJoe sat out last season to-concentrate on academics, and was<br />\nhampered by a broken thumb during the preseason. He has a decent short-range jumper and will<br />\ncome off the bench to play on the<br />\nlow post. He is distinguishable by<br />\nhis \"Boz\" haircut, which will<br />\ndefinitely<br />\nintimidate<br />\nthe<br />\nopposition.<br />\n<br />\nproving on last year's 6-18 record. So why<br />\nis Coach Nelson looking forward to the<br />\n1987-88 season?<br />\n\"Just because we're young doesn't mean<br />\nwe're not talented,\" commented Nelson.<br />\n\"Our additions seem to be talented in the<br />\nareas of last year's weaknesses, and they<br />\nknow how to win.\"<br />\nIndeed, no one is going to have to teach<br />\nthe new Blue Jays how to be victorious.<br />\nAlmost all of the recruits were top players<br />\non extremely strong teams last year.<br />\nBill Zahn comes from East Brunswick<br />\nHigh in New Jersey, a team that sported<br />\na 25-3 record last season and went to the<br />\nstate semi-finals.

Everybody<br />\nknows about it; everybody ignores it; people are hurting<br />\nthemselves.<br />\nForgive me, I got carried<br />\naway\u2014somebody is trying to do<br />\nsomething about it. Dean Colombo's office is sponsoring a<br />\nSubstance Abuse Day on<br />\nDecember 8 in the Glass Pay. My<br />\nunderstanding is that there will be<br />\na number of different displays,<br />\nassorted speakers, computer tests<br />\nand things of the sort. The administration is to be commended<br />\nfor its efforts. . . it remains to be<br />\nseen whether the student body<br />\nwill respond.<br />\nThis is a sports editorial. . .<br />\nDrugs and alcohol in sports.<br />\nBias' death last year drew much<br />\nattention to this problem.<br />\nHopkins responded with a drug<br />\n<br />\nand alcohol prpgram for all<br />\nathletes. This year the program<br />\nhas been dropped. Among the<br />\narguments for dropping the program this year: athletes felt singled out and many didn't appreciate<br />\nthe lectures. I think it's fair to say<br />\nthat the administration is willing<br />\nto provide information, services. . . but right now, they're at<br />\na loss for what to do. Substance<br />\nAbuse Day is a good first effort<br />\nto reach the general student<br />\npopulation. A similar effort needs<br />\nto be made in dealing with sports<br />\nteams.<br />\nCoaches should go through extensive training programs on how<br />\nto deal with drug and alcohol<br />\nabuse. . . how to recognize problems and what to do once they<br />\nare recognized. I've passed this<br />\nidea along to some at the Athletic<br />\nCenter. The reaction I received:<br />\ncoaches should not be singled out.<br />\nIf they have to go through an ex-<br />\n<br />\ntensive training program, then all<br />\nteachers should have to do the<br />\nsame. At the time I knew this<br />\nargument didn't hold but as is<br />\noften the case, the reason doesn't<br />\nhit me till a few hours later. . .<br />\nCoaches are privileged for they<br />\nhave the opportunity to get to<br />\nknow students on an individual<br />\nbasis. Teachers usually don't<br />\nhave this opportunity. Given that<br />\ncoaches have this privilege, they<br />\nshould use this opportunity to<br />\nhelp student-players.<br />\nMary Ellen Porter, Special<br />\nAssistant to the Dean of Students,<br />\nseemed enthusiastic about the<br />\nidea of a special training program<br />\nfor coaches, promising that she<br />\nwould pass the idea on to Dean<br />\nColombo. With the administration being supportive, the ball is<br />\nin the coaches' hands. Hopefully<br />\nthey realize the value of such a<br />\nprogram and encourage its<br />\ndevelopment.<br />\n<br />\nwould provide more playing time<br />\nwhich is needed on pleasant<br />\ndays when many people want to<br />\nplay.<br />\nAlso a backboard would be an<br />\ninexpensive, fabulous, necessary<br />\naddition to the courts.

All the<br />\nwhile, eerie music washed over<br />\ntheir ears. The only other thing<br />\none could hear was the hypnotist's voice. Were the<br />\nvolunteers actually falling into a<br />\ntrance, or were they just play-<br /><br />\nacting?<br />\nKolisch, who claims to be the<br />\nworld's fastest hypnotist, had the<br />\nvolunteers under the control of<br />\nhis voice in seconds. One person<br />\nwent from being a child on a<br />\nmerry-go-round one moment to<br />\nbeing Elvis Presley the next moment, giving an unrehearsed performance of\"Love Me Tender\"<br />\nto the wild applause of the audience. \"Poof! Sleep,\" said<br />\nKolisch, and the person he had<br />\nawakened fell back into deep<br />\nsleep.<br />\nThe volunteers, open to any<br />\nand all of the hypnotist's suggestions, responded so spontaneously to Kolisch's voice as to almost<br />\nexclude the possibility that they<br />\nwere feigning hypnosis. No matter how often the audience burst<br />\ninto laughter or interrupted with<br />\ncatcalls or cheers, they continual<br />\nunfazed in the belief that they<br /><br />\nwere Arnold Schwarzenegger,<br />\nJohn Wayne, Madonna, or<br />\nMikhail Baryshnikov.<br />\nHypnosis revealed much about<br />\nthe volunteers' personality and<br />\ncharacter. After handing out play<br />\nmoney to the entire group,<br />\nKolisch asked,\"Who has not gotten any money?\" Stashing the<br />\nloot into their pants, their<br />\nblouses, or even their mouths, the<br />\ngreedier ones kept asking for<br />\nmore.

The proposal, being submitted by Jeff DeCagna,<br />\na member of the CUS, is to expand the<br />\nnumber of departments which offer minors.<br />\nPresently, many of the language departments, Art History and Writing Seminars<br />\nhave programs for a minor.<br />\nThe minor, by indicating concentrated<br />\nstudy in an additional field, is recognition<br />\nfor efforts to expand the scope of education. It can supplement or complement the<br />\nmajor, displaying either interest and<br />\nknowledge in a broader range of subjects<br />\nor enhanced understanding of a field of<br />\nstudy through interdepartmental approach.<br />\nNaturally, a more well-rounded education should be sought, regardless of notations on a transcript. It would be a mistake,<br />\nhowever, for Hopkins not to encourage expanding a student's horizons by offering<br />\nsome acknowledgement.<br />\nWriting Seminars offers evidence that instituting a minor encourages participation<br />\nin a department. Four years ago, Writing<br />\nSems decided to go ahead with a minor.<br />\nThe requirements were set at one half of<br />\nthose for the Writing Sems major. The institution of a minor enabled students outside of the department to take Writing Sems<br />\ncourses, for in the minor program was<br />\nstipulated that minors as well as majors get<br />\nfirst crack at the courses before the rest of<br /><br />\nthe student body. Demand was overwhelming. The minor was removed for a year.<br />\nThough it was reinstituted under the condition that students going for the minor<br />\nwould have to compete with the rest of the<br />\nschool for courses, Writing Seminars continues to attract great numbers of students.<br />\nThe department's insightfulness into the<br />\nmentality of Hopkins students is admirable.<br />\nAlso, while encouraging many more<br />\nstudents to actively participate in the program, the department is thriving.<br />\nPerhaps it is a secondary point, but<br />\nminors also encourage a broader education<br />\nby making it easier to do so. Students are<br />\nenticed to double major largely to satisfy<br />\ntheir own interests, but also to show that<br />\nthey have tried to broaden themselves<br />\n(although the recognition of a notation on<br />\none's transcript is, in this regard, unsatisfactory). The attempt to double major<br />\nis a great strain\u2014and so potentially<br />\ndetrimental to an undergraduate career. Offering minors gives the opportunity to<br />\nrelieve some of the pressure, since there are<br />\nfewer requirements.<br />\nWhile the proposal includes recommendations which bear close scrutiny, the inherent logic of the minor should push it to<br />\napproval. The proposal calls for institution<br />\nof the minor's programs as of September,<br />\n1988. Given prudent execution by the CUS,<br />\nand subsequently by the Programs Committees of the academic departments, there is<br />\nno reason not to implement minors at that<br />\ntime.<br /><br />\nThe exam is WHEN???<br />\nA couple of weeks ago, students opened<br />\ntheir campus mailboxes to find the final exam schedules nestled among transcripts,<br />\nlecture announcements, and overdue book<br />\nnotices.<br />\nMost of us probably went home and<br />\nmarked up our calendars with final exam<br />\ndates and then proceeded to call the airlines<br />\nand schedule the earliest flight home.<br />\nIt wouldn't be until a number of weeks<br />\nlater that, as students prepare for the postThanksgiving, end-of-semester sprint, people realize the absence of a reading period.<br />\nNot only has the reading period been<br />\neliminated, but exams were scheduled ur<br />\nuntil December 23rd\u2014only two days hi-03re<br />\nChristmas.<br />\nA number of professors fo.lid these late<br />\nexam dates as distastefiL? as the students.<br />\nAs a result, they moved some of these<br />\nexams\u2014often by a week or more.<br />\nSo insult as been added to injury. Not<br />\nonly do students have no real opportunity<br />\nto propare for exams after classes end; even<br />\na normal exam schedule has been curtailed by its proximity to the Christmas holiday. Exams have been piggybacked and<br />\nhence concentrated into a schedule that is<br />\neven shorter than usual.<br />\nAlmost everyone will suffer from an<br />\nagonizing schedule this December. After<br />\nThanksgiving break, we will all return to<br />\nschool to face two more weeks of classes<br />\nimmediately followed by an intense exam<br /><br />\nperiod. Why? Apparently the Administration saw fit to begin classes this semester<br />\na week or so later than usual to avoid the<br />\nLabor Day ordeal. Because of this,<br />\nhowever, our semester ends later than usual<br />\nand forces the elimination of the readily,<br />\nperiod. This is a critical time for stud-tits<br />\nto adequately prepare for exams aw)polish<br />\noff term papers. With the academic<br />\npressures at Hopkins being \u201enat they are,<br />\nwe have to wonder why ON: Administration<br />\nshould choose to make things even more<br />\ndifficult- 3imply for a minor September<br />\nhowaY \u2022<br />\nWe suggest that the Administration examine the student mentality in an attempt<br />\nto schedule the semester weeks. After a<br />\nlong, hot summer, most people are eager<br />\nto return to school, see their college friends<br />\nagain, and get started in their studies again.<br />\nMany state universties begin their Fall<br />\nsemester in late August; this allows students<br />\nto be finished, exams and all, by midDecember.<br />\nThe University's yearly calendar is an intricate one; it must correspond with the<br />\nother division of the University for commencement purposes, etc. However, we<br />\nwould like the Administration to realize that<br />\nthere must be some other way to accomodate the year-long schedule without<br />\nputting additional pressure on our already<br />\nhectic semester.<br /><br />\nThar She Blows<br />\nby A. Lee Davis<br />\nI'm sitting at the computer with<br />\nTchaikovsky on the tape deck,<br />\nwaiting for creative inspiration.<br />\nSuddenly it begins again, a low<br />\nresonant hum that could be the<br />\nbeginning of a Gregorian chant or<br />\na Moonie mantra. In the space of<br />\na second it builds to a desperate<br />\ncry of disgust which can only<br />\nmean one thing: Lisa has found<br />\nanother roach.<br />\nEveryone in Baltimore has their<br />\nown roach story, from \"The<br />\nRoach that Ate my VCR\" to<br />\n\"1001<br />\nChocolate-covered<br />\nroaches,\" and everyone has their<br />\nown way of dealing with the buggers. Roachophobia (not the same<br />\nmalady recently suffered by<br />\nJudge Ginsburg), like fear of flying, is best overcome through<br />\ndirect confrontation. Therefore,<br />\nLisa and I do not call the exterminator, spread boric acid, or<br />\nslice cucumbers. We have a<br />\nsystematic method of dispatching<br />\nroaches, an organized procedure<br />\nany Civil Defense Agency would<br />\nbe proud of. Judging from the<br />\nmagic marker notches on my<br />\ntrusty Pony, it is quite successful.<br />\nLike a hurricane warning on<br />\nthe radio or an air-raid siren splitting the night, Lisa's alarm is<br />\nPhase One: This is not a test. If<br />\nthis were a test I wouldn't be<br />\nscreaming would I? I dash into<br />\nthe kitchen and we stare down the<br />\nevil-looking, foul-smelling<br />\ncreature from Hell. Like soldiers<br />\nin our first firelight, we are<br />\nparalyzed for a moment, then instincts and training take over and<br />\nwe snap into action.<br />\n.<br />\nThe beast has crouchedar,,three<br />\ninches of his loathsome body in<br /><br />\nthe far corner of the cupboard,<br />\nforcing us to an alternate<br />\nstragegy.<br />\n\"Corollary action B of Phase<br />\nTwo,\" I whisper. Lisa nods and<br />\nbegins the removal of innocent<br />\nnon-perishable goods from the<br />\nline of fire. Out come the Hunt's<br />\nTomato Paste, the Campbell's<br />\nsoup, the Cheerio's(who seem to<br />\nbe quite panic-stricken by the<br />\nepisode, not that I can blame<br />\nthem). As we get closer to our<br />\nquarry, all communications are<br />\ncut. Fly low. Radio silence.<br />\nWhen we have the bugger<br />\nisolated, Phase Two proper<br />\nbegins. I snatch the Scrub-Free<br />\nAll-Purpose (really all-purpose)<br />\nCleaner banned chemical warfare, but when it's man against<br />\nroach, when the wife, children,<br />\nand Instant Tapioca hang in the<br />\nbalance, it's no holds barred. I<br />\nswitch the directional head from<br />\nstream (kill) to spray (stun). Call<br />\nme sadistic, but I want to take my<br />\ntime with this one. Sensing my intentions, the roach makes a dash<br />\nfor a crack. I aim and, bracing<br />\nmyself for the horsekick recoil,<br />\nfire.<br />\nA net of greenish bubbles leaps<br />\nacross the gap and pulls the struggling insect from the side of the<br />\ncupboard. It falls on its back,<br />\nclawing the air, and ern, an<br />\nunearthly shriek. A \u00e7tiek.<br />\nWait. That IN?

To aid in this,<br />\nmany students will surrender<br />\ntheir meal card for a day,<br />\ndesignating their money to this<br />\n\"hunger fund.\" One of the sponsors of this program is Oxfam<br />\nAmerica. Indeed, if Oxfam<br />\nAmerica did only what it said it<br />\ndid, it might be worthwhile to<br />\ngive to it, but given the reality<br />\nthat they DON'T live up to their<br />\nclaims, giving to Oxfam is literally giving to an illusion.<br />\nThe issue is not hunger. The<br />\nissue is that Oxfam America<br />\nclaims to have no political ties<br />\nand maintains an image of a nonpolitical organization. This image<br />\nis one that exists under a shroud<br />\nof propaganda. Many people probably signed away their meal card<br />\nwithout ever knowing that Oxfam<br />\ndoes not, indeed, confine itself to<br />\nsolving hunger problems.<br />\nFortune magazine (December<br />\n12, 1983) explains some of Oxfam's other interests. Their<br />\neconomic ideals are centered<br />\naround a \"New International<br />\nEconomic Order\" which calls<br />\nfor, in addition to the transfer of<br />\nfunds and resources to Third<br />\nWorld countries, a condemnation<br />\nof American militarism.

At least you have conmovements<br />\nanti- sidered what you are signing<br />\nand<br />\ninterventionist<br />\ndoctrines. when you give your meal card<br />\nWhether or not you agree with away for a day. And then if you<br />\nthe above political convictions is still want to support the prototally irrelevant. If you want to pagandistic illusion of Oxfam,<br />\ngive money away to an organiza- you are free to do so.

Oxfam America, based in Boston,<br />\nwas established in 1970, and is<br />\none of seven autonomous Oxfams<br />\naround the world. Though Oxfam<br />\ndoes provide disaster relief during crises, its primary focus is on<br />\nthe sponsorship of development<br />\nprograms which build local selfreliance or to \"help people help<br />\nthemselves.\" Examples of ongoing projects in Africa are the construction of small dikes and dams<br />\nfor irrigation in various communities of Mauritania and the<br /><br />\nprovision of emergency suppiies<br />\nsuch as cloth and utensils for<br />\nrefugees of war in Mozambique.<br />\nIn Asia, Oxfam provides the funding for a fertilizer distribution<br />\nstation in India, and on Negros<br />\nIsland in the Phillipines, it has<br />\nestablished a small-scale coconut<br />\nprocessing unit operated by<br />\nunemployed sugar workers.<br />\nFinally, in Latin America, Oxfam<br />\nprovided support for health programs in the rural areas of El<br />\nSalvador where other medical<br />\nservices do not exist, and in Honduras, it established literacy and<br />\nagricultural training programs in<br />\nsix rural communities.

In its third year, the JHU<br />\nHunger Committee is a looselyknit group of people making a<br />\nmodest effort toward an end to<br />\nworld hunger and creating an<br />\nawareness of the issue among the<br />\nmembers of the Hopkins community. Last year's fast raised<br />\nover $2000 for Manna House and<br />\nOxfam and in the spring, the<br />\nHunger Committee raised $150<br />\nselling crafts from the Third<br />\nWorld at Hopkins' annual fair.<br />\nCertainly the primary focus of<br />\nthe fast is to raise money for two<br />\nworthy organizations.

Hewitt<br /><br />\nTo the Editor:<br />\nI am in complete agreement<br />\nwith the conclusion of James<br />\nLechtman's that it is wise to consider all options in the pursuit of<br />\npeace. Indeed, I had hoped that<br />\nmy letter of Nov. 6 would point<br />\nto the difficulty in accomplishing<br />\nthis desirable goal of examining<br />\nall options: potentially useful options such as SDI(or rearmament<br />\nduring World War II) are less obvious pathways toward peace and<br />\nare thus often overlooked in favor<br />\nof apparently more direct routes<br />\nsuch as international agreements.<br />\nLechtman<br />\nUnfortunately,<br />\nobscures the thrust of my remarks<br />\nby focusing attention on whether<br />\nSDI is actually effective, a question I did not directly address<br />\nbecause it is peripheral to my<br />\nargument.<br />\nIronically, in pursuing the<br />\nperipheral question of the effectiveness of SDI, Lechtman illustrates another pitfall inherent<br />\nin examining complicated issues:<br />\noversimplification. In drawing an<br />\nanalogy to SDI he indicates that<br />\nthe Maginot Line was ineffectual<br />\nin protecting France from the<br />\nhorrors of World War II. The implication that the fall of France<br />\ncan be attributed to the failure of<br />\nthe Maginot Line is an oversimplification that ignores<br />\nnumerous other factors. Any<br />\ndefensive system, be it the<br />\nMaginot Line or SDI, must be examined in the context of an<br />\noverall strategic policy, historical<br />\nsetting, etc. The complicated<br /><br />\nquestions surrounding the causes<br />\nof World War I, World War II,<br />\nand how best to preserve peace<br />\ntoday, are examined in detail in<br />\nan article by Donald Kagan in the<br />\nMarch 1987 issue of Commentary.

You call it the<br />\n\u2022'biggest waste of money,\" and<br />\nhence let's talk.<br />\nWe are part of a community of<br />\nwhich we are really not a part.<br />\nWe sometimes live in less attractive parts of the city. We don't<br />\nhave much of a central meeting<br />\nplace and most live all around the<br />\ncampus and hence for us to get<br />\ntogether we have to travel some<br />\ndistance. We all can't afford to<br />\nbuy cars or live in McCoy or the<br />\nCharles. We can't afford to run<br />\nto Eddie'$$$ whenever we need<br />\nsomething. So what a nice thing<br />\nit is that some 'yappers' on Council strongly encouraged the improvement of the shuttle system.<br />\nLike too many things we get<br />\nfree\u2014we abuse it and I am sure<br />\nthis is still the case with the shuttle. This affects the service that<br />\ncan be provided and hence the<br />\noverall community.

I'm not proud to say<br />\nthat I go to a school where people stop and think about where a<br />\nsoft drink is made before buying<br />\nit. Who cares? If it tastes good,<br />\nthen drink it.<br />\nI fail to see the logic used by<br />\nCFSA in trying to impose some<br />\nprimeval form of guilt in me by<br />\ngetting me to envision some poor,<br />\noppressed soul in South Africa.<br />\nIf I'm thirsty, I really don't care<br />\nwhere the company invests.<br />\nI urge the wise students of<br />\nHopkins to overlook this triviality and remember that to change<br />\na form of government takes alot<br />\nmore than making students at a<br />\nsmall liberal arts college feel guilty about what they're drinking.<br />\nI also remind the students that<br />\nlast year, Tom Hall (a chief<br />\nCFSA leader in the quest to ban<br />\nCoke) was photographed drinking. . . you guessed it\u2014a Coke. I<br />\nguess he realized that politics and<br />\ntaste don't mix; the carbonation<br />\nmakes it settle out.<br />\nChristopher L.

As that<br />\ngame let out, a friend and myself<br />\nhappened to be walking along<br />\nUniversity Ave. at Union<br />\nMemorial. Coming the other<br />\nway, were members of these local<br />\nhigh schools who, in their merriment, were throwing ice and<br />\nsnowballs at every person on the<br />\nstreet, including myself, my<br />\nfriend, and an elderly gent who<br />\nthey brutally bombarded and<br />\nforced into the street.<br />\nNow, this incident, in and of<br />\nitself, does not evoke a feeling of<br />\n\"racial overtone\" in me\u2014just a<br />\ncouple of kids having a little fun,<br />\nright? Well my humor turned to<br />\noutrage when I learned that a<br />\nHopkins undergraduate was<br />\nphysically assaulted, receiving injuries to the face and chest.<br />\nI'm not here to shout racism<br />\nover a few isolated incidences.<br />\nThe laws of probability can account for the fact that those attacked were white\u2014just in the<br />\nwrong place at the wrong time<br />\nand all that. But I do wish to suggest that the Hopkins administration think twice before allowing<br />\nthese two high schools to use our<br />\nfacilities again. Perhaps an<br />\napology from the respective<br />\nsecondary schools' administration<br />\nis in order. Comments or<br />\nclarification/rebuttal would be<br />\nappreciated.<br />\nTom Yeich<br /><br />\nA Closed Mind<br />\nTo the Editor:<br />\nSandrine Tiller's review of<br />\nDeep Throat is a classic example<br />\nof a closed mind at work. In her<br />\nfirst and last paragraphs, she<br />\nstates her dislike for X-rated<br />\nmovies as a whole. Framed in this<br />\nway, why bother to read the article? How can anyone take her<br />\nopinion seriously in that context?<br />\nHow did she come to review this<br />\nfilm in the first place? (It's kind<br />\nof like asking Hitler to speak at<br />\nyour bar mitzvah, isn't it?)<br />\nThe review (surprise, surprise)<br />\nstates that the movie degraded<br />\nwomen, that the main character<br />\nwas \"constantly depicted as a<br />\nslave, subject to the needs of the<br />\nmen she serves.\" Did I see the<br />\nsame movie? Throughout the<br />\nfilm, Linda Lovelace wants sex,<br />\nactively seeks it out, and enjoys<br />\nit. When she was treated as a<br />\n\"slave\" or a \"purely sexual object\"? I don't recall (because<br />\nthere are none) any scenes of<br />\nLovelace being forced to perform<br />\nsex acts against her will. I do<br /><br />\nrecall, however, the image of her<br />\ndoctor-playmate begging her not<br />\nto have sex with him because he's<br />\nexhausted. They have sex,<br />\nthough, because she wants it.<br />\nWho's being used here?<br />\nAnd then there is the 'deep<br />\nanalysis' of the film. \"Marriage<br />\nis the ultimate orgasm\"?<br />\n\"Fraught with Joycean stream of<br />\nconsciousness\"? Come on. This<br />\nis a porno movie, with the<br />\nprimary goal of all porno movies:<br />\nto make a buck. 'Deep analysis'<br />\nhas no place here. It can be applied, of course, but 'deep<br />\nanalysis' can be applied to just<br />\nabout anything.<br />\n\"The dressing of female<br />\ncharacters in white is an obvious<br />\nplay on. . . virginity vs. wantonness\"? Most of the women are<br />\ndressed in white because most of<br />\nthe women are nurses. Nurses<br />\nwear white. So do doctors. And<br />\nGood Humor men.<br />\nIn closing, I would like to address the News-Letter editors: Do<br />\nus all a favor and don't make Sandrine review any more porno<br />\nmovies. She doesn't enjoy them,<br />\nwhich is her right; but we who<br />\ndo, don't enjoy her reviews.<br /><br />\n\"OK,11\"S TV*.

It is quite proper for the<br />\nUniversity to make facilities<br />\navailable for educational and<br />\nentertainment purposes. The announcements were discreet and<br />\ninoffensive.

Ettle<br />\nThe Barnstormer's production<br />\nof The Fantasticks this past<br />\nweekend was not what one would<br />\nexpect from a typical musical.<br />\nThere was no overly-obnoxious<br />\ntap dancing, no specticular<br />\nlighting effects or technical<br />\nwizardry. Director Jonathan<br />\nTycko, acknowledging these<br />\nshortcomings in his program<br />\nnotes, asked his audience to<br />\n\"abandon [their] preconceptions<br />\nabout the art of musical theater<br />\nand love.\" His intentions were<br />\nhonorable, but Tycko fell<br />\nsomewhat short of his goal of<br />\nconveying the \"essence of theater<br />\nand love.\" While Fantasticks<br />\ndelivered many swashbuckling<br />\nand stunning moments, its pace<br />\nwas oftentimes too slow to engage<br />\nits audience.<br />\nFantasticks possessed all the<br />\nelements of an endearing love<br />\nstory. Matt (Michael Robinson),<br />\na young college boy, and his sixteen year old neighhbor Luisa<br />\n(Jill Austin) fall in love despite a<br />\nwall erected by their parents between<br />\nthe<br />\ntwo<br />\nhouses.<br />\nUnbeknownst to the children, the<br />\nparents, Hucklebee (Kara Stein)<br />\nand Bellomy (Sanjay Aggarwal),<br />\nbuilt the wall intending that the<br />\ntwo fall in love and eventually<br />\nmarry. \"To<br />\nmanipulate<br />\nchildren,\" says Bellomy, \"you<br />\nmerely say 'No!' \" Drawn<br />\ntogether by their parents' disapproval, Matt and Luisa fall deeply in love. Hucklebee and<br />\nBellomy then plan an elaborate<br />\nscheme in which the hired bandit<br />\nEl Gallo (Jonathan Kurtz) and his<br /><br />\nhenchmen<br />\nHenry (Andy<br />\nAngelino) and Mortimer(Howie<br />\nFried) stage the \"rape\" of Luisa.<br />\nEl Gallo intentionally permits<br />\nMatt to defeat him so that the boy<br />\nmay earn the favor of both<br />\nparents. The scheme is successful<br />\nand Matt and Luisa make plans to<br />\nmarry. But when Hucklebee lets<br />\nit slip that she and Bellomy planned the marriage by building the<br />\nwall and arranging the \"rape,\"<br />\nthe two children quickly lose the<br />\nmagic of their romance. Matt<br />\nleaves Luisa brokenhearted to<br />\ndiscover the world, but soon<br />\nreturns battered by his experiences. Luisa, too, is<br />\ndistraught over a failed romance<br />\nwith El Gallo. Realizing that<br />\ntheirs was a true love, Matt and<br />\nLuisa reconcile.<br />\nAlthough initially intense,<br />\nAustin quickly eased into her role<br />\nas the childish yet appealing<br />\nLuisa, charming many with her<br />\nprotrayal of the insecure, romantic girl (\"Please, God, don't let<br />\nme be normal!\"). While well cast<br />\nas Luisa, Austin, however, lacked the vocal range for some of her<br />\nsongs. He rendition of \"Much<br />\nMore\" was off key at certain<br />\ntimes and somewhat distracting to<br />\nthe audience. Austin's exuberance, nevertheless, truly<br />\nenhanced her character and made<br />\nup for her musical lapses.<br />\nAggarwal and Stein are<br />\nespecially appealing in this production as the witty, meddlesome<br />\nparents. Stein, as Matt's<br />\ndisciplined Navy mother, provides the necessary comic relief<br />\nin her believable role. Her<br />\nmusical numbers with Aggarwal,<br /><br />\nSuspect's<br />\nGripping Escapism<br />\nby Sandrine Tiller<br />\nYour teeth gritted, you're moving down further and further into the seat. Then you suddenly<br />\nshift forward, grabbing the seat<br />\nin front of you. Suspect keeps you<br />\nawake, and it's guaranteed you<br />\nwon't look at your watch.<br />\nSuspense is the name of the game,<br />\nand Suspect plays it well.<br />\nSuspect opens violently with a<br />\nsuicide, a murder, and a beating.<br />\nA homeless man is convicted of<br />\nwhat seems to be a straightforward murder. Cher, an overworked state defense attorney, is<br />\nassigned to represent him in<br />\ncourt. Dennis Quaid is a congressional aide who is a juror on this<br />\nhe<br />\nis<br />\nAlthough<br />\ncase.<br />\nunscrupulous in his dealings in<br />\ncongress, something about the<br />\ncase and Cher's honesty intrigues<br />\nhim. He begins to do some investigative work, following up<br />\ndetails Cher has overlooked. He<br />\ncommunicates his findings to her,<br />\nand as they both get involved in<br />\nthe investigation, their situation<br />\nbecomes more precarious (jurors,<br />\nof course, aren't supposed to be<br />\nin contact with lawyers). Naturally, they also become involved in<br />\neach other, bringing the stakes up<br />\neven higher. As more details<br />\ncome to light and the plot<br />\nberames thicker,.tension<br />\nThis movie links the harsh<br /><br />\nworld of the homeless with that<br />\nof the marble-topped Justice<br />\ndepartment, without ever seeming forced. It is a film about integrity, with Cher as the obvious<br />\nheroine, overworked, underpaid,<br />\nyet courageous and honest. The<br />\nbad guys are from the highceilinged, leather-chaired offices.<br />\nQuaid is the transition between<br />\nthese worlds. He is also<br />\ncourageous, like Cher, and now<br />\nhe puts his wily ways to good use.<br />\nHis investigations lead him, at<br />\nvarious points, white-faced in his<br />\ncommuter's overcoat, to where<br />\nthe homeless live. And there, the<br />\nonly thing that redeems his incongruence is his honesty.<br />\nCher plays her part well. She<br />\nis the one you warn, you cheer,<br />\nand you believe in. She is portrayed as a constant victim of injustice, saved by her integrity and<br />\nthe strength of her beliefs. It's a<br />\ncorny order, but Cher makes her<br />\ncharacter human and multi-faced<br />\nwithout becoming trite. Quaid is<br />\nsomewhat weaker in his performance, yet he has a definite<br />\nscreen presence (as exemplified<br />\nin the electrifying Big Easy). He<br />\nis intense, resourceful and never<br />\nboring, but he does get lukewarm<br />\nat times, in comparison to Cher.<br />\nThe sexual tension between the<br />\ntwo balances well with the tension<br />\n' \u2022\u2022<br />\nSee SUSPECT, page 20<br /><br />\nincluding \"Never Say No\" and<br />\n\"Plant a Radish\" are refreshing<br />\nand entertaining due to the upbeat<br />\nchoreography of Deidre LaBarre.<br />\nRobinson was somewhat<br />\nwooden as the smitten Matt.<br />\nThough he possesses a captivating<br />\nstage voice best heard in \"I Can<br />\nSee It,\" Robinson generated little energy or emotion toward his<br />\nlove Luisa. Many of his scenes<br />\nwere in fact stolen by the mere<br />\npresence of Jonathan Kurtz as El<br />\nGallo. Kurtz deserves much<br />\ncredit for renewing the dragging<br />\npace of the second act. He played<br />\nthe roguish El Gallo with ease and<br />\nconfidence despite a few stressful<br />\nflat notes, and also narrated the<br />\nplay with remarkable candor.<br />\nThey rhyming narratives of Edmund Rostand's script did grow<br />\ntedious, even with Kurtz's crisp<br />\ndelivery and evocative pantomimes of The Mute, played by<br />\nMary Kita. However, Kurtz<br />\nmanaged wonderfully with the<br />\nrhymes and maintained his<br /><br />\nenergy on stage.<br />\nThe circus-like antics of El<br />\nGallo's henchmen, Henry and<br />\nMortimer, added greatly to the<br />\nhilarity of the play. Angelino,<br />\nalthough miscast as an elderly,<br />\nhas-been actor, nonethless won<br />\nover his audience with his timely<br />\nquotations of Shakespeare. Fried,<br />\non the other hand, pushed his role<br />\na bit too much. The same<br />\nhyperactive humor and interplay<br />\nwith the audience which made<br />\nhim memorable in \"The Bald<br />\nSoprano\" was unfitting here.<br />\nYet, both Fried and Angelino<br />\nsuccessfully remained in<br />\ncharacter throughout the play<br />\nand, like Kurtz, were instrumental in keeping up the pace of the<br />\nshow.<br />\nTycko as director was too involved in setting his actors<br />\nonstage rather than creating a<br />\nmood. Oftentimes, Tycko placed<br />\nhis actors in tableaus or awkward<br />\npositions, thus reducing their interaction. As a result, Matt and<br /><br />\nLuisa never onced looked at one<br />\nanother in \"They Were You\"<br />\nand lacked much needed<br />\nchemistry to keep the conclusion<br />\nof the play from dragging.<br />\nAnother example was the action<br />\noffstage in \"Round and Round.\"<br />\nBy having Matt run throughout<br />\nthe audience, Tycko detracted<br />\nfrom the pivotal scene onstage<br />\nbetween Luisa and El Gallo.<br />\nHowever, the subtle aspects of<br />\nThe Fantasticks were most commendable. Music Director Paula<br />\nSteuernagel included a harp in her<br />\norchestra which created a<br />\nbrilliant, romantic atmosphere.<br />\nAlso, the delicate expressions and<br />\ngraceful movements of Kita as<br />\nThe Mute furthered the storyline<br />\nwithout disrupting either the audience or the actors. These<br />\nsubtleties made the play<br />\nmemorable and added a creative<br />\ndimension to Tycko's wholly<br />\nworthwhile production.<br /><br />\nLet My People ComeNon-Eroticism at Godfrey's<br />\nby Amy Reiter<br /><br />\npiece. . .[It] was meant to express<br />\nthe new attitude about sex.\" He<br />\nlater mourns, \"The sexual<br />\nrevolution is over. It's been<br />\nlost.\"<br />\nSeveral minor changes have<br />\nbeen made to the show, such as<br />\nthe addition of a prologue and a<br />\nfew alterations in the lyrics of the<br />\nlast number. But Earl Wilson<br />\nJr.'s original script, written in<br />\n1973, is pretty much intact. The<br />\nlast line, \"today's way of loving<br />\nneeds a new set of rules,\" is a noble, but weak stab at an up-to-date<br />\nmessage.<br />\nPhil Roy admits that his show<br />\nis easy to criticize. \"It's put<br />\nto ether easily, so it's eas to take<br /><br />\napart.\" Still, he gets angry with<br />\n\"tight asses\" who criticize his<br />\nshow. \"It's not for people who<br />\ntake themselves real seriously.\"<br />\nHe warns, \"Basically, you have<br />\nto leave your mind at home.\"<br />\nWho laughs? \"This is a show<br />\naimed at a little older audience. . . A young college audience is usually too worried<br />\nabout their own sexuality and getting laid to sit back and look at a show that really makes fun of<br />\nit all.\"<br />\nRoy shakes his head. \"What<br />\nare you gonna do, they're kids.<br />\nI wasn't a kid so I can't relate to<br />\nthat.\"<br /><br />\nLet My People Come is Producer Phil Roy's \"own little<br />\ncrusade.\" The show, playing this<br />\nmonth at Godfrey's Famous<br />\nBallroom, is a musical review<br />\ncomprised of sixteen skits looking back at the sexual revolution<br />\nof the 1960's and '70's. It contains about ten minutes of nudity<br />\nand more than a couple four-letter<br />\nwords. Roy and company have<br />\nbeen in court constantly fighting<br />\nthe various state boards who<br />\nclaim that the show is \"lewd and<br />\nimmoral.\"<br />\nPhil Roy leans across the table<br />\nin the spacious ballroom turned<br />\ncabaret and smiles.<br />\n\"I enjoy doing something that<br />\nis different whether it is against<br />\nthe law or not. . .Just the ideas of<br />\nanybody saying, 'No, you can't<br />\ndo something' gets me crazy.\"<br />\nWell, let's face it. The state<br />\nboard is wasting its time. The<br />\nhype surrounding Let My People<br />\nCome is pretty interesting. Phil<br />\nRoy himself is pretty interesting.<br />\nBut the show is not at all interesting. Oh, it gets in an occasional zinger, but those are few<br />\nand far between.<br />\nRoy assures us that the nudity<br />\nin the show \"is not in any way<br />\nerotic.\" He's absolutely right.<br />\nAnd the language? \"To use fourletter words over and over again<br />\nreduces them to an absurdity. \u2014<br />\nThat, too, is accurate. So why all<br />\nthe fuss?<br />\nAccording to Roy, \"in the<br />\n'70's when the show was written,<br />\nit was just showing what was going on around us. It was very important especially to the parents<br />\nof the children of the sexual<br />\nrevolution, because those parents<br />\nhad to deal with the sexual<br />\nrevolution through their children,<br />\nwhich was nerve wracking for<br />\nmost of them.\"<br />\nThe original purpose of the<br />\nshow has been lost to the changing times. Roy comments', \"Let<br />\nMy People Come is a period The cast of Let My People Come appearing in the buff at Godfrey's.<br /><br />\n20/NOVEMBER 20, 1987<br /><br />\nPhil Gochenour:<br /><br />\nArts Callcinchr<br /><br />\nThe Flip Side<br />\nHey gang, remember disco?<br />\nYeah, I know, school dances<br />\nweren't much fun during the<br />\ndisco era, but things did eventually get better. Disco is still with<br />\nus, however, in a somewhat<br />\nmutated form. The music is still<br />\nbasically the same\u2014slickly produced to the point of being a cool<br />\nslice of ice, with good healthy<br />\nchuncks of hedonism, narcissism,<br />\nand nihilism thrown in. This is<br />\nprobably because the disco scene<br />\nis still more or less the same, except nowadays people wear black<br />\nclothes and dog-chains instead of<br />\nwhite leisure suits and gold<br />\nmedallions. One thing, however,<br />\nis significantly different. Whereas<br />\nin the old days the old Moog synthesizer was about as good as it<br />\ngot (and that was pretty damn<br />\ncheezy), today we have Fairlights<br />\nand DX-7's that can make any<br />\nsound known to man, even be a<br />\nband in itself.<br />\nIndeed some bands, like the<br />\nAustralian group Icehouse, seem<br />\nto be nothing but computers,<br />\nsynths, and rack-mount effects.<br />\nStrangely enough, it seems to be<br />\nprimarily foreign bands that really go for this medium. One of the<br />\nmore interesting of these groups<br />\nis the Bolshoi, a British group that<br />\nreally knows how to use a<br />\nFairlight to do the most musical<br />\ndamage. Their new album, Lindy's Party, is a good example of<br /><br />\nthe cutting edge of heavily synthesized, produced-to-the-max<br />\nmusic. Everything, including the<br />\nvoice of lead vocalist Trevor Tanner, sounds as if it's being run<br />\nthrough something, which takes<br />\na lot of the emotional edge off of<br />\nthe music. This is fairly compensated for, however, by more<br />\nsnakily-grooved melodies than<br />\nyou can shake a stick at. \"Crack<br />\nin Smile,\" for example, inches<br />\nalong for two versus, slowly<br />\nbuilding up the tension, then exploding outwards into a soaring<br />\nchorus that only lets you rest for<br />\na minute before hooking you in<br />\nagain. You wanna hear a great<br />\nuse of dissonance and digital<br />\ndelay, than this is the song.<br />\n\"T.V. Man,\" one of the singles<br />\nfrom this album, is worth the<br />\nalbum price alone. This song has<br />\nit all\u2014really cool, hooky lyrics,<br />\nmighty fine guitar solos, and<br />\nTrevor Tanner's voice warbling<br />\nover at least three octaves. Check<br />\nit out gang, these guys might be<br />\nthe next hot band\u2014they might get<br />\nto do a song for \"Miami Vice\"<br />\nif they're lucky.<br />\nDon't bother with The Leather<br />\nNun, and their new album, Force<br />\nof Habit. If it tells you anything,<br />\nthis group is from Sweden, the<br />\nsame country that gave us Abba.<br />\nSure, they've got a provocative<br />\nname, they wear Russian 1Shirts, and they look like<br /><br />\ncharacters from Diva. They are,<br />\nhowever, boring as hell. These<br />\nguys seem to think that the best<br />\nuse a synth can be put to is the<br />\nor electronic drone. Over this is<br />\nlayered the most minimal of fuzz<br />\nguitar riffs, the most languid<br />\nrhythms I've ever heard (I think<br />\nit's supposed to sound sinister),<br />\nand lead singer Jonas Almquist's<br />\nintoning half-growled lyrics like<br />\n'I left my heart on desolation<br />\navenue/I took my soul away.<br />\nZzzzzz. . .so play something I<br />\nhaven't heard a million times<br />\nbefore.<br />\nOkay, in all fairness, not all of<br />\nit is completely bad. Probably the<br />\nmost happenin' track on this<br />\nalbum is \"Girrme, gimme,<br />\ngimme (a man after midnight)\"<br />\n(surprisingly enough, a cover of<br />\nan Abba song), which actually<br />\nmanages to rock out despite<br />\neverything else. Since this album<br />\nis a collection of singles,<br />\nhowever, you don't have to buy<br />\nthe whole album to get this one<br />\nsong. It's available on Wire<br />\nrecords, if you really feel you<br />\nmust have it, or maybe Adam<br />\nEnde will just let you tape his<br />\ncopy.<br />\nUmm, to think that the or<br />\ngloom and doom, dark-dance<br />\nscene has gone from Bauhaus and<br />\nJoy Division to this.

Bantam New Fiction,<br />\n$37.95, 438 pp.<br />\nby Mary Ginder<br />\nLife During Wartime is a terrific book. The characters have<br />\ndepth, the plot has action, the<br />\nprose is lyrical, and there is<br />\nnothing trite about it.<br />\nThe war is a Communist vs.<br />\nCapitalist conflict ranging over<br />\nmuch of Central America. The<br />\nprotagonist, David Mingolls, is a<br />\nsoldier in the American occupation army in Guatemala. This is<br />\nnot, however, a novel about combat and military strategy.<br />\nThe time is approximately the<br />\nlate 1990s. War has continued<br />\nadv-\"ced<br />\nmore<br />\nbecome<br />\ntechnologically, but ,tiew element has been adr\": the use of<br />\nelite cadres ut people with<br />\npsychic al titles who have learned ho,to exert the force of their<br />\nh.,.us over others, either to affect<br />\nemotions or to kill outright. Many<br />\nother \"futuristic\" devices are<br />\nalso present in the novel, but it<br />\nresists being classified as<br />\n\"science fiction.\"<br />\nMingolla meets a beautiful<br />\npsychic, Debora, but does not<br />\nknow that she is working for the<br />\nother side. She has dreamed of<br />\nhis death in the war and tries to<br />\nconvince him to desert, but he<br />\nrefuses. After he is recruited as<br />\na psychic by his own side, he<br />\nbecomes obsessed with the<br />\nmemory of Debora; he learns that<br />\nshe is an enemy agent and decides<br />\nto kill her. The novel is not,<br />\nhowever, a thriller and David<br />\ndoes not spend the rest of the<br />\nnovel hunting her down. (Don't<br />\nlet the blurb on the back cover<br />\nfool you.)<br />\nIn short, this is a book about<br />\nlove and war and survival. It is<br /><br />\nalso a book about the search to<br />\nunderstand love and war and survival. Love in this novel is not<br />\nmoonlit nights and walks on the<br />\nbeach; yes, David thinks he loves<br />\nDebora, but he has to struggle to<br />\nfind out what love means in a<br />\nworld turned upside down.<br />\nTogether they learn that there is<br />\na war behind the war, a conflict<br />\nthat has lasted centuries and taken<br />\ninnumerable lives.<br />\nThe contrast of the real and ale<br />\nfantastic is integral to Lie During Wartime. This i symbolized<br />\nby the impositior Jt the American<br />\nhigh tech f,i-ces into a region<br />\nwhere 0.; people \"were trapped<br />\nbet\u201eeen the poles of magic and<br />\nason, their lives governed by<br />\nthe politics of the ultrareal, their<br />\nspirits ruled by myths and<br />\nlegends, with the computerized<br />\nbulk of North America<br />\nabove . .<br />\nShepard's characters remain<br />\nrealistic amidst his liberal use of<br />\nthe fantastic. Their personalities<br />\nand motivations are complex and<br />\nbelievable; they think, feel, and<br />\nact in very plausible ways. At the<br />\nsame time, Shepard throws in a<br />\nlot of elements that would sound<br />\nridiculous out of context\u2014for example, killer butterflies and a<br />\ncomputer that pretends to be God.<br />\nShepard writes the kind of prose that makes you reread the<br />\nparagraph you have just finished<br />\nsimply because it was so wellwritten. His descriptions have a<br />\nlyrical, almost poetic quality to<br />\nthem that is especially powerful<br />\nin describing the horror and<br />\ndevastation of the war. The ending, in particular, is beautifully<br />\ndone.<br />\nLife During Wartime has a lot<br />\nto say about morality, but it does<br />\nnot moralize.

Bulk form refers to<br />\nmacroscopic pellets, some cm or<br />\nmm in diameter. Studies of these<br />\nlarger and more tangible ceramics<br />\nwould provide a crucial understanding to certain properties exhibited by the superconductor, including the orthorhombic structure, the order, and the oxidation<br />\nvacancy. The thin film enables<br />\ncertain measurements of the<br />\nsuperconductor such as tunneling<br />\nand proximity-effects that cannot<br />\nbe determined in the bulk form.<br />\nThese are the physical dimensions<br />\nthat are being studied to provide<br />\nperhaps a greater understanding<br />\nof the superconductor.<br /><br />\nWhen asked to envision the<br />\nfuture of the superconductor, Dr.<br />\nChien believeckthat the media has<br />\ngiven the publit a misleading<br />\nview of this technology. It is<br />\nalmost as if the \"Nev' Kirk Times<br />\nand other papers have led the<br />\npublic to believe that the application of the superconductor is just<br />\naround the corner.\" Dr. Chien<br />\nexplains that materials which can<br />\nconduct at temperatures much<br />\nhigher than 90 degrees Kelvin are<br />\navailable but one must understand<br />\nthat in order for the superconductor to be useful in devices it must<br />\nsurvive certain stringent criteria.<br />\nDumping the material in water or<br />\nexposing it to humidity, for example, would immediately terminate the superconducting properties. A second problem arises<br />\nwith the internal degradation of<br />\nthe superconductor. As the<br />\nceramic material is composed of<br />\noxides, there inevitably will be<br />\nsome decomposition\u2014the life expectancy of the materials are<br />\ntherefore unknown.<br />\nAnother stumbling block<br />\ntoward the actual implementation<br />\nof the superconductor lies in its<br />\nform. Many perceive the use of<br />\na superconducting wire to carry<br />\nthe current, but again Dr. Chien<br />\nsuggests that presently such a<br /><br />\nwire would be too low in density. One must realize that superconducting material is much like<br />\na fine powder or grain. Though<br />\neach separate grain may have<br />\nideal properties, when put<br />\ntogether the conductivity may be<br />\nwcakened considerably.

My<br />\nunderstanding is that there will be<br />\na number of different displays,<br />\nassorted speakers, computer tests<br />\nand things of the sort. The administration is to be commended<br />\nfor its efforts. . . it remains to be<br />\nseen whether the student body<br />\nwill respond.<br />\nThis is a sports editorial. . .<br />\nDrugs and alcohol in sports.<br />\nBias' death last year drew much<br />\nattention to this problem.<br />\nHopkins responded with a drug<br /><br />\nand alcohol prpgram for all<br />\nathletes. This year the program<br />\nhas been dropped. Among the<br />\narguments for dropping the program this year: athletes felt singled out and many didn't appreciate<br />\nthe lectures. I think it's fair to say<br />\nthat the administration is willing<br />\nto provide information, services. . . but right now, they're at<br />\na loss for what to do. Substance<br />\nAbuse Day is a good first effort<br />\nto reach the general student<br />\npopulation. A similar effort needs<br />\nto be made in dealing with sports<br />\nteams.<br />\nCoaches should go through extensive training programs on how<br />\nto deal with drug and alcohol<br />\nabuse. . . how to recognize problems and what to do once they<br />\nare recognized. I've passed this<br />\nidea along to some at the Athletic<br />\nCenter. The reaction I received:<br />\ncoaches should not be singled out.<br />\nIf they have to go through an ex-<br /><br />\ntensive training program, then all<br />\nteachers should have to do the<br />\nsame. At the time I knew this<br />\nargument didn't hold but as is<br />\noften the case, the reason doesn't<br />\nhit me till a few hours later. . .<br />\nCoaches are privileged for they<br />\nhave the opportunity to get to<br />\nknow students on an individual<br />\nbasis.
