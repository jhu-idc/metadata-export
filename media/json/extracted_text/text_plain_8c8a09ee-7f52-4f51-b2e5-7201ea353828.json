XXII, NO. 14.<br />\n<br />\nFUEL SAVING AND THE WAR<br />\nBy ALEXANDER G.CHRISTIE, M.E.<br />\n<br />\n[This is the fifth of the series of articles on war problems written for THE<br />\nIslEws-LErrEn by a member of the faculty. Associate Professor Christie, of<br />\nthe school of mechanical engineering,<br />\nhas been actively interested in the fuel<br />\nproblem, of which he has made a thorough study, and has recently launched<br />\na fuel conservation campaign. In view<br />\nof the coal proclamation of last week,<br />\nthe article assumes additional signiflcance\u2014En.]<br />\n<br />\nARTICLE V.<br />\nFood saving has become a national effort and one is reminded<br />\non every hand that \"food will win<br />\nthe war.\" This is only partly true,<br />\nfor what use is food if we have not<br />\nenough fuel to move it or to make<br />\nships to carry it across, or even<br />\nto make shells and munitions for<br />\nour men at the front? Hence,<br />\n\"fuel\" is quite as important a factor in winning the war as food.<br />\nIt has been stated that we are<br />\nproducing 50,000,000 tons more<br />\ncoal this year than last year. Yet<br />\nwe are experiencing a very serious<br />\nfuel shortage. This is due to an increased demand over last year<br />\nfor 100,000,000 tons of coal, due<br />\nlargely to our industrial activity for war purposes. Hence, we<br />\nface a net deficit of 50,000,000tons,<br />\nand unless we allow our war activitities to slow down, this can<br />\nonly be taken care of in the following ways. Coal reserves can be<br />\ndrawn on. Industries non-essential to war can be closed down.<br />\nCoal can be saved by employing<br />\nmore efficient methods in firing it<br />\nand in using heat.<br />\nAlmost all coal reserves have already been drawn upon and they<br />\nare now practically exhausted.<br />\nThe Government is taking steps to<br />\nlimit the amount of coal supplied<br />\nto industries whose output is not<br />\nessential to winning the war. Engineers and manufacturers have<br />\nturned their attention to the problem of saving fuel. This question<br />\nhas already been given much consideration in Baltimore, and such<br />\nefforts will probably produce the<br />\ngreatest relief. Let us consider for<br />\na moment the facts bearing on this<br />\nsituation.<br />\nIn 1917 we produced about 700,000,000 tons of bituminous coal in<br />\nthis country. Of this, domestic consumers used about 15 per cent.;<br />\nthe railroads used about 10 per<br />\ncent., while 67 per cent., or<br />\nroughly 470,000,000 tons were<br />\nburned to produce steam in industrial plants. Engineers of national<br />\nprominence have pointed out that<br />\nit is easily possible to save at least<br />\n10 per cent. and probably even<br />\nmore of this coal if improved<br />\nmethods of firing are employed<br />\nand heat wastes are eliminated.

M. C. Van Hulsteyn,<br />\n'18, who enlisted in the Naval Reserves last spring. Brooks is the<br />\nonly army man of the quartet, the<br />\nother three men all being \"seagoing\" men. Both Brooks and<br />\nWolfe are members of the Hopkins Circle of the Omicron Delta<br />\nKappa.<br />\n<br />\nBy a series of general orders<br />\nlast week Major Guild took a significant step in the direction of<br />\nputting the Hopkins Reserves Officers' Training Corps Unit on a<br />\nwar basis. The most important<br />\nthing was the starting of lectures<br />\nand recitations for the entire battalion in the science of warfare.<br />\nThere will be every Wednesday at<br />\n11.30 o'clock a battalion lecture<br />\nwhich all members of the corps<br />\nare required to attend; in addition, there will be one period of<br />\nrecitation a week for all men, who<br />\nare divided into two classes for<br />\nthe purpose of instruction, a first<br />\nyear and a second year class. All<br />\nsecond year men must also take a<br />\ncourse in military field engineering on Tuesday from 4 to 6 P. M.<br />\nThese classes and lectures virtually have precedence over all<br />\nother University work. Besides<br />\nthese, however, there is the formation of the following classes for<br />\ninstruction and conference: 1. An<br />\nofficers' school, meeting Fridays,<br />\nfrom 1 to 3 P. M., which all commissioned officers must attend. 2.<br />\nA staff class, for commissioned<br />\nassistant instructors, meeting<br />\nWednesdays from 4 to 6 P. M. 3.<br />\nA staff conference for all commissioned assistant instructors above<br />\nthe grade of first lieutenant, to<br />\nmeet Fridays from 11.30 to 12.30.<br />\nIn the second place, the R. 0.<br />\nT. C. Unit at the University is<br />\nfrom now on composed of the following four divisions:<br />\n1. The Division of Infantry<br />\nTraining.<br />\n2. The Division of Military<br />\nField Engineering.<br />\n3. The Division of Military Signal Engineering.<br />\n4. The Division of Physical<br />\nTraining.<br />\nThis last feature was made possible by the incorporation of the<br />\nDepartment of Physical Training<br />\nunder the control of the Commandant of the R. 0. T. C. Unit,<br />\nto which end Dr. R. T. Abercrombie is appointed captain, R. 0. T.<br />\nC., and is made surgeon' of the<br />\nHopkins R. 0. T..C. Unit; and Instructor Theodore Kistler is appointed assistant instructor, R. 0.<br />\nT. C., this University, with the<br />\nrank of sergeant.<br />\nIn order to make the corps a<br />\nsmooth, proficient working unit<br />\nan advisory board is formed, constituted of the heads of the four<br />\ndivisions: Major Guild, Captain<br />\nTilden, Captain Kouwenhoven,<br />\nand Captain Abercrombie, which<br />\n<br />\nDr. Grave was commissioned<br />\ncaptain in the Ordnance Department and has been ordered to report at the newly-acquired proving grounds at Gunpowder Neck,<br />\nwhere he will be engaged \"in some<br />\nimportant work.\" J. L. Krieger,<br />\n'18, laboratory assistant in chemistry, and W. H. Taliaferro, laboratory assistant in biology, will<br />\nbe associated with Captain Grave<br />\nin his work. Captain Grave is a<br />\ngraduate of Johns Hopkins University, having received his Ph. D.<br />\nin 1899; and was Bruce Fellow<br />\nduring the years of 1900 and 1901.<br />\nFor six years, ending with 1912,<br />\nhe was Shell Fish Commissioner<br />\nfor the State of Maryland. For<br />\nthe last few years he has acted as<br />\nDirector of the Woods Hole Laboratory in Massachusetts during<br />\nthe summer. He\u2022 was always popular among the students of biology, in each of whom he took a<br />\nkeen, personal interest. Until the<br />\ntime of his departure Captain<br />\nGrave served as a private in Company \"C\" of the Hopkins Battalion, in which he enlisted this<br />\nfall. Dr. E. A.

They must be sought with the<br />\ngreatest diligence. And they are<br />\nbeing so sought, as can best be<br />\nshown by figures.. Only last week<br />\nthe air service turned away two<br />\napplicants out of every three. The<br />\nsafety of the country as well as of<br />\nthe men themselves demands that<br />\nthe standard be maintained irreproachable.<br />\nThe one greatest of all places for<br />\nreal airmen is in the colleges.<br />\nThere, indeed, is the flower of the<br />\ncountry, men who having received<br />\nmuch, owe much. The proportion<br />\nof them answering the requirements of the air service should be<br />\nimmeasurably larger than among<br />\nless favored, less fortunate men.<br />\nIf America breaks the deadlock<br />\nof three..years through the air, if<br />\nthe wings of her new eagles bring<br />\nvictory to the world's democracies,<br />\nit will largely be the college men<br />\nwho will have the credit of it. Already there is a great fraternity<br />\nof them in the service, working as<br />\nthey never worked before, in this<br />\ncountry, in England, in France, in<br />\nItaly, in Egypt.<br />\nNow is the time, for it will require until next summer for an aspirant starting now to become<br />\ncomplete master of the air.

Any<br />\nair that leaks through cracks or<br />\nholes into the boiler represents<br />\njust so much dead loss in fuel.<br />\nThese leaks can be stopped very<br />\neasily by plastering up such<br />\ncracks.<br />\nEvery citizen can help save heat.<br />\nAll unnecessary lights should be<br />\nkept turned off; radiators should<br />\nbe closed off before raising windows and should be turned off<br />\nwhen leaving offices for the day.<br />\nHalls need less heat than is now<br />\ncommon practice, and the heat can<br />\nbe cut off some entirely.<br />\nAlmost all homes are overheated. Sixty-eight degrees is a comfortable living temperature, and if<br />\nproper clothing is worn a lower<br />\ntemperature can be carried. Until<br />\nthe war is won we must learn to<br />\ndress ourselves in warmer clothes<br />\nand save our precious\u2022 coal for<br />\nhelping out the boys \"over there.\"<br />\nThe man who brags of wearing the<br />\nsame weight of underwear both<br />\nsummer and winter will soon be<br />\nlooked upon as a disloyal citizen,<br />\nfor he is unnecessarily wasting<br />\nvaluable fuel to keep his home up<br />\nto summer temperature.<br />\nThe present extreme shortage of<br />\ncoal is due to transportation difficulties, and probably will not be<br />\ngreatly relieved this winter. A<br />\nnumber of circumstances have<br />\ncontributed to this condition. The<br />\nrailways have been short of money<br />\nfor years, and their equipment has<br />\nnot been properly maintained to<br />\nmeet the unprecedented increase<br />\nin traffic. They have lost employees in the draft, and repairs<br />\ntake unduly long time. The winter has been more severe than<br />\nusual, with increased difficulties<br />\nfrom snow and frost. Locomotives are being sent abroad instead of being added to our own<br />\nrolling stock, and cars are tied up<br />\nin congested yards at ocean shipping points. The problem is a<br />\ncomplicated one and will take<br />\nsome time for the railroads to<br />\novercome these difficulties.<br />\nThe condition confronting us is<br />\na very serious one. Coal is a prime<br />\nnecessity in the conduct of the<br />\nwar, and our war industries must<br />\nbe kept going. A serious coal<br />\nshortage exists, and the only apparent way to relieve it is to reduce our ordinary coal demands<br />\nby every means possible.<br />\nFuel saving is therefore a patriotic duty of every citizen, for<br />\nthe fuel saved will make possible<br />\na greater output of munitions. It<br />\nis said that it takes four pounds<br />\nof coal to produce one pound of<br />\nsteel in a shell. The average<br />\nweight of steel in all shells is<br />\nabout 25 pounds. So every time<br />\none manages to save 100 pounds<br />\nof coal, one can expand his chest,<br />\npoint to the saved fuel and say:<br />\n\"There's another shell for the<br />\nKaiser.\"<br />\n<br />\nwould thus be possible to save 50,000,000 tons per year of the coal<br />\nused for industrial purposes. If<br />\nthis saving were effected the pal<br />\nshortage would be overcome and<br />\nour industrial life would not be<br />\ndisturbed.<br />\nHow can this saving be effected? Firemen must be induced to<br />\noperate boilers and furnaces at<br />\nhigher economy. This involves<br />\ntechnical methods, and technical<br />\ninstruments that need not be discussed here but which are familiar to all first-class operating engineers.<br />\nEqual opportunities to save fuel<br />\nlie in the utilization of heat after<br />\nit is generated.

Coleman, Jr., '20.<br />\nBALTIMORE, MD., JAN. 21, 1918.<br />\nA Test of Non-combatant Patriotism.<br />\n<br />\nAbout one-half of the nation<br />\nawoke last Thursday to find itself<br />\nconfronted by a Government order<br />\nthat (besides robbing many breakfasts of all pleasure) involved a<br />\nmaterial sacrifice or, at least, a<br />\ncertain amount of inconvenience.<br />\nThe order came as lightning from<br />\na clear sky\u2014no warning, no evasion, no time for deliberation or<br />\npreparation. It was as if an<br />\nenemy, in the absence of our army,<br />\nhad suddenly landed upon our<br />\nshores\u2014had attacked us without<br />\nthe least warning; it was a crucial<br />\ntest of the patriotism of the \"men<br />\nbehind the army.\"<br />\nMomentarily, the public press,<br />\nthe overwhelming majority of the<br />\nbusiness men, and Congress\u2014the<br />\ngreat organ of public opinion,<br />\ncombine:I to pour forth a mighty,<br />\nroaring stream of protest that<br />\nmust have resounded throughout the world\u2014even to the hills<br />\nof France and the newspaper offices of Germany. Just what effect was produced is, at this time,<br />\nimpossible to determine. One<br />\nthing, however, is quite certain:<br />\nIt could not have heartened American soldiers nor the Allied<br />\nArmies to have learned that their<br />\ncountrymen and their Allies, for<br />\nwhom they were gladly sacrificing<br />\ntheir lives and their all, had loudly and stubbornly complained of<br />\na comparatively insignificant sacrifice or slight inconvenience. Soldiers understand the importance<br />\nand the necessity of discipline, authority, and self-sacrifice, for a<br />\nwell-organized and efficient civil<br />\ngovernment as well as for a well-<br />\n<br />\norganized and efficient army. To<br />\nour soldiers in the field it could<br />\nnot have been a particularly<br />\nhappy and convincing demonstration.<br />\nFortunately, there was a different attitude at Johns Hopkins<br />\nUniversity and, presumably, at<br />\nevery other college and university<br />\nwithin the jurisdiction of the socalled \"drastic order.\" The colleges stand out sharply and creditably by way of contrast. Early<br />\nThursday morning the President<br />\ncalled a meeting of a faculty committee; and, before noon, there<br />\nwas posted on the bulletin boards<br />\nnotices to the effect that\u2014in accordance with the Fuel Administrator\u2014the buildings of the University would be closed on the<br />\nnext ten Mondays. The schedule<br />\nof classes was readily adjusted to<br />\nthe proposed changes. No confusion, no demonstrations, no protests\u2014despite the fact that there<br />\nwas, according to the standards of<br />\nthe general public, ground enough<br />\nfor protest. It is significant that<br />\nthe University immediately recognized the importance of unqualified and unflinching support of the<br />\nGovernment's order. Promptness<br />\nand unanimity were the demands<br />\nof the moment; delay and protest<br />\nspelled accumulative obstructions<br />\nand partial, if not complete failure.. It is only one more example<br />\nof the intelligence, loyalty and unselfishness that has constantly<br />\ncharacterized the attitude toward<br />\ntheir Government in a crucial period of colleges and college men.<br />\nThe Air Service and the Colleges.<br />\n<br />\nThe article on the Air Service of<br />\nthe United States Army, printed<br />\nelsewhere in these columns, has a<br />\ndirect appeal to every college<br />\nman: the Air Service is peculiarly<br />\na college affair. The importance<br />\nand significance of airplanes in<br />\nthis war has been attested by two<br />\nforemost Hopkins professors\u2014<br />\nMajor Wood and Dr. Ames\u2014both<br />\nof whom have officially visited the<br />\nbattle lines of France. The highest qualities of intelligence, character, and physique are required<br />\nof applicants to the Air Service,<br />\ninto which it is a recognized honor<br />\nand privilege to be accepted. And<br />\nthe Recruiting Bureau does not<br />\ntry to conceal the fact that it<br />\nwants, in preference to all others,<br />\ncollege men, who by virtue of their<br />\ntraining, are best fitted for the responsibilities and rigors of the Air<br />\nService. The spirit of adventure<br />\nand the thrill of discovery will be<br />\nsatisfied and met in the aviation<br />\nService. Finally, and above all,<br />\nthe Government tells the colleges<br />\nthat it needs aviators. \"The Government may depend, as ever,<br />\nupon the colleges,\" is the only answer we can suggest.<br />\n0.

HOLLANDER1 FOR ECONOMY<br />\nIn First of a Series of Lectures on Food<br />\nConservation, Dr. Hollander Emphasizes Necessity for Economy.<br />\n<br />\nDr. Jacob Hollander, professor<br />\nof political economy at this University, in the first of a series of<br />\nlectures to be delivered before the<br />\nWomen's Civic League at McCoy<br />\nHall laid particular stress on the<br />\nfact that in order to bring the nation up to its highest point of efficiency during war-times the manufacture of non-essentials must be<br />\neliminated from the present industrial program.<br />\nHe stated in the course of his<br />\nlecture that the surplus from year<br />\nto year in economic goods is very<br />\nsmall and once the machinery of<br />\nproduction is interrupted a scarcity is bound to occur. \"We are literally living from hand to mouth,\"<br />\nwas the way that Dr. Hollander<br />\nexpressed\u2022 the present situation<br />\nand therefore the maintenance of<br />\nour industries is essential to the<br />\nlife of the nation.<br />\nThe withdrawal of men from<br />\nthe industries is of necessity<br />\nbound to result in the decrease of<br />\nnational income. The situation,<br />\nhowever, is more complicated than<br />\nthis, for these men are not only<br />\nwithdrawn from the mills and factories of the country, but must<br />\nbe fed and clothed.<br />\nDr. Hollander pointed out that<br />\nthere is but one solution to this<br />\nvery grave problem and that is to<br />\nproduce more. He deplored the<br />\nfact that the editorial columns of<br />\nthe daily papers and the magazines of the country have been<br />\nthus far so indifferent to the situation and have not impressed on<br />\nthe people of the nation the necessity for increased saving.<br />\nThe solution of the present problem, as Dr. Hollander sees it, is<br />\nthe elimination of the manufacture of non-essentials. The men,<br />\ncapital and materials that are today going into the manufacture<br />\nof things that are unnecessary<br />\nshould be diverted to make up the<br />\ndeficit that will result when a million men are taken away to carry<br />\non the war.<br />\nDr. Hollander concluded his lecture with a few words of advice<br />\nhow each individual can do his<br />\nbit to win the war. \"Cut your<br />\nspending to the bone,\" he said.\"<br />\n\"Be guided in the running of your<br />\nhousehold by the Food Commission. Convert your saving\u00a7 into<br />\nLiberty Bonds. If working, work<br />\nharder. If idle, work. Just so far<br />\nas the people of the United States<br />\nfall short in these things, just so<br />\nfar do we fail to contribute our<br />\nshare to the winning of the war.\"<br />\nThe next lecture will be delivered by Hon. Edwin G. Baetjer,<br />\nFood Administrator of Maryland,<br />\non \"Food Legislation and Administration,\" on Tuesday, January<br />\n29, 1918.<br />\n<br />\nNEWS FROM MEN IN SERVICE<br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER wants to devote<br />\nthis page to news of Hopkins men in<br />\nthe service. It is impossible for the<br />\neditors to keep in touch with every<br />\nman in the service; the co-operation of<br />\nthe families and friends of Hopkins<br />\nmen with the colors is earnestly<br />\nsought.

XXII, NO. 14.<br /><br />\nFUEL SAVING AND THE WAR<br />\nBy ALEXANDER G.CHRISTIE, M.E.<br /><br />\n[This is the fifth of the series of articles on war problems written for THE<br />\nIslEws-LErrEn by a member of the faculty. Associate Professor Christie, of<br />\nthe school of mechanical engineering,<br />\nhas been actively interested in the fuel<br />\nproblem, of which he has made a thorough study, and has recently launched<br />\na fuel conservation campaign. In view<br />\nof the coal proclamation of last week,<br />\nthe article assumes additional signiflcance\u2014En.]<br /><br />\nARTICLE V.<br />\nFood saving has become a national effort and one is reminded<br />\non every hand that \"food will win<br />\nthe war.\" This is only partly true,<br />\nfor what use is food if we have not<br />\nenough fuel to move it or to make<br />\nships to carry it across, or even<br />\nto make shells and munitions for<br />\nour men at the front? Hence,<br />\n\"fuel\" is quite as important a factor in winning the war as food.<br />\nIt has been stated that we are<br />\nproducing 50,000,000 tons more<br />\ncoal this year than last year. Yet<br />\nwe are experiencing a very serious<br />\nfuel shortage. This is due to an increased demand over last year<br />\nfor 100,000,000 tons of coal, due<br />\nlargely to our industrial activity for war purposes. Hence, we<br />\nface a net deficit of 50,000,000tons,<br />\nand unless we allow our war activitities to slow down, this can<br />\nonly be taken care of in the following ways. Coal reserves can be<br />\ndrawn on. Industries non-essential to war can be closed down.<br />\nCoal can be saved by employing<br />\nmore efficient methods in firing it<br />\nand in using heat.<br />\nAlmost all coal reserves have already been drawn upon and they<br />\nare now practically exhausted.<br />\nThe Government is taking steps to<br />\nlimit the amount of coal supplied<br />\nto industries whose output is not<br />\nessential to winning the war. Engineers and manufacturers have<br />\nturned their attention to the problem of saving fuel. This question<br />\nhas already been given much consideration in Baltimore, and such<br />\nefforts will probably produce the<br />\ngreatest relief. Let us consider for<br />\na moment the facts bearing on this<br />\nsituation.<br />\nIn 1917 we produced about 700,000,000 tons of bituminous coal in<br />\nthis country. Of this, domestic consumers used about 15 per cent.;<br />\nthe railroads used about 10 per<br />\ncent., while 67 per cent., or<br />\nroughly 470,000,000 tons were<br />\nburned to produce steam in industrial plants. Engineers of national<br />\nprominence have pointed out that<br />\nit is easily possible to save at least<br />\n10 per cent. and probably even<br />\nmore of this coal if improved<br />\nmethods of firing are employed<br />\nand heat wastes are eliminated.

The most important<br />\nthing was the starting of lectures<br />\nand recitations for the entire battalion in the science of warfare.<br />\nThere will be every Wednesday at<br />\n11.30 o'clock a battalion lecture<br />\nwhich all members of the corps<br />\nare required to attend; in addition, there will be one period of<br />\nrecitation a week for all men, who<br />\nare divided into two classes for<br />\nthe purpose of instruction, a first<br />\nyear and a second year class. All<br />\nsecond year men must also take a<br />\ncourse in military field engineering on Tuesday from 4 to 6 P.

Besides<br />\nthese, however, there is the formation of the following classes for<br />\ninstruction and conference: 1. An<br />\nofficers' school, meeting Fridays,<br />\nfrom 1 to 3 P.

Besides health, besides<br />\nbravery, besides consciousness, an<br />\nairman must have brains and<br />\njudgment. Brains because only a<br />\ntrained mind can master flying,<br />\nradio, aerial photography, codes,<br />\nreconnaissance and the kindred<br />\nsciences necessary to this new science. Judgment because all these<br />\npowers in the hands of an ill-balanced mind might work a ghastly<br />\nhavoc among the men who are sent<br />\nforward or held back on an airman's signal.<br />\nLet us not think such men are<br />\nplentiful: Most decidedly they are<br />\nnot. They must be sought with the<br />\ngreatest diligence. And they are<br />\nbeing so sought, as can best be<br />\nshown by figures.. Only last week<br />\nthe air service turned away two<br />\napplicants out of every three. The<br />\nsafety of the country as well as of<br />\nthe men themselves demands that<br />\nthe standard be maintained irreproachable.<br />\nThe one greatest of all places for<br />\nreal airmen is in the colleges.<br />\nThere, indeed, is the flower of the<br />\ncountry, men who having received<br />\nmuch, owe much.

Already there is a great fraternity<br />\nof them in the service, working as<br />\nthey never worked before, in this<br />\ncountry, in England, in France, in<br />\nItaly, in Egypt.<br />\nNow is the time, for it will require until next summer for an aspirant starting now to become<br />\ncomplete master of the air.

Any<br />\nair that leaks through cracks or<br />\nholes into the boiler represents<br />\njust so much dead loss in fuel.<br />\nThese leaks can be stopped very<br />\neasily by plastering up such<br />\ncracks.<br />\nEvery citizen can help save heat.<br />\nAll unnecessary lights should be<br />\nkept turned off; radiators should<br />\nbe closed off before raising windows and should be turned off<br />\nwhen leaving offices for the day.<br />\nHalls need less heat than is now<br />\ncommon practice, and the heat can<br />\nbe cut off some entirely.<br />\nAlmost all homes are overheated. Sixty-eight degrees is a comfortable living temperature, and if<br />\nproper clothing is worn a lower<br />\ntemperature can be carried. Until<br />\nthe war is won we must learn to<br />\ndress ourselves in warmer clothes<br />\nand save our precious\u2022 coal for<br />\nhelping out the boys \"over there.\"<br />\nThe man who brags of wearing the<br />\nsame weight of underwear both<br />\nsummer and winter will soon be<br />\nlooked upon as a disloyal citizen,<br />\nfor he is unnecessarily wasting<br />\nvaluable fuel to keep his home up<br />\nto summer temperature.<br />\nThe present extreme shortage of<br />\ncoal is due to transportation difficulties, and probably will not be<br />\ngreatly relieved this winter. A<br />\nnumber of circumstances have<br />\ncontributed to this condition. The<br />\nrailways have been short of money<br />\nfor years, and their equipment has<br />\nnot been properly maintained to<br />\nmeet the unprecedented increase<br />\nin traffic. They have lost employees in the draft, and repairs<br />\ntake unduly long time. The winter has been more severe than<br />\nusual, with increased difficulties<br />\nfrom snow and frost. Locomotives are being sent abroad instead of being added to our own<br />\nrolling stock, and cars are tied up<br />\nin congested yards at ocean shipping points. The problem is a<br />\ncomplicated one and will take<br />\nsome time for the railroads to<br />\novercome these difficulties.<br />\nThe condition confronting us is<br />\na very serious one. Coal is a prime<br />\nnecessity in the conduct of the<br />\nwar, and our war industries must<br />\nbe kept going. A serious coal<br />\nshortage exists, and the only apparent way to relieve it is to reduce our ordinary coal demands<br />\nby every means possible.<br />\nFuel saving is therefore a patriotic duty of every citizen, for<br />\nthe fuel saved will make possible<br />\na greater output of munitions. It<br />\nis said that it takes four pounds<br />\nof coal to produce one pound of<br />\nsteel in a shell. The average<br />\nweight of steel in all shells is<br />\nabout 25 pounds. So every time<br />\none manages to save 100 pounds<br />\nof coal, one can expand his chest,<br />\npoint to the saved fuel and say:<br />\n\"There's another shell for the<br />\nKaiser.\"<br /><br />\nwould thus be possible to save 50,000,000 tons per year of the coal<br />\nused for industrial purposes. If<br />\nthis saving were effected the pal<br />\nshortage would be overcome and<br />\nour industrial life would not be<br />\ndisturbed.<br />\nHow can this saving be effected? Firemen must be induced to<br />\noperate boilers and furnaces at<br />\nhigher economy. This involves<br />\ntechnical methods, and technical<br />\ninstruments that need not be discussed here but which are familiar to all first-class operating engineers.<br />\nEqual opportunities to save fuel<br />\nlie in the utilization of heat after<br />\nit is generated.

It was as if an<br />\nenemy, in the absence of our army,<br />\nhad suddenly landed upon our<br />\nshores\u2014had attacked us without<br />\nthe least warning; it was a crucial<br />\ntest of the patriotism of the \"men<br />\nbehind the army.\"<br />\nMomentarily, the public press,<br />\nthe overwhelming majority of the<br />\nbusiness men, and Congress\u2014the<br />\ngreat organ of public opinion,<br />\ncombine:I to pour forth a mighty,<br />\nroaring stream of protest that<br />\nmust have resounded throughout the world\u2014even to the hills<br />\nof France and the newspaper offices of Germany. Just what effect was produced is, at this time,<br />\nimpossible to determine. One<br />\nthing, however, is quite certain:<br />\nIt could not have heartened American soldiers nor the Allied<br />\nArmies to have learned that their<br />\ncountrymen and their Allies, for<br />\nwhom they were gladly sacrificing<br />\ntheir lives and their all, had loudly and stubbornly complained of<br />\na comparatively insignificant sacrifice or slight inconvenience. Soldiers understand the importance<br />\nand the necessity of discipline, authority, and self-sacrifice, for a<br />\nwell-organized and efficient civil<br />\ngovernment as well as for a well-<br /><br />\norganized and efficient army. To<br />\nour soldiers in the field it could<br />\nnot have been a particularly<br />\nhappy and convincing demonstration.<br />\nFortunately, there was a different attitude at Johns Hopkins<br />\nUniversity and, presumably, at<br />\nevery other college and university<br />\nwithin the jurisdiction of the socalled \"drastic order.\" The colleges stand out sharply and creditably by way of contrast. Early<br />\nThursday morning the President<br />\ncalled a meeting of a faculty committee; and, before noon, there<br />\nwas posted on the bulletin boards<br />\nnotices to the effect that\u2014in accordance with the Fuel Administrator\u2014the buildings of the University would be closed on the<br />\nnext ten Mondays. The schedule<br />\nof classes was readily adjusted to<br />\nthe proposed changes. No confusion, no demonstrations, no protests\u2014despite the fact that there<br />\nwas, according to the standards of<br />\nthe general public, ground enough<br />\nfor protest. It is significant that<br />\nthe University immediately recognized the importance of unqualified and unflinching support of the<br />\nGovernment's order. Promptness<br />\nand unanimity were the demands<br />\nof the moment; delay and protest<br />\nspelled accumulative obstructions<br />\nand partial, if not complete failure.. It is only one more example<br />\nof the intelligence, loyalty and unselfishness that has constantly<br />\ncharacterized the attitude toward<br />\ntheir Government in a crucial period of colleges and college men.<br />\nThe Air Service and the Colleges.<br /><br />\nThe article on the Air Service of<br />\nthe United States Army, printed<br />\nelsewhere in these columns, has a<br />\ndirect appeal to every college<br />\nman: the Air Service is peculiarly<br />\na college affair. The importance<br />\nand significance of airplanes in<br />\nthis war has been attested by two<br />\nforemost Hopkins professors\u2014<br />\nMajor Wood and Dr. Ames\u2014both<br />\nof whom have officially visited the<br />\nbattle lines of France. The highest qualities of intelligence, character, and physique are required<br />\nof applicants to the Air Service,<br />\ninto which it is a recognized honor<br />\nand privilege to be accepted. And<br />\nthe Recruiting Bureau does not<br />\ntry to conceal the fact that it<br />\nwants, in preference to all others,<br />\ncollege men, who by virtue of their<br />\ntraining, are best fitted for the responsibilities and rigors of the Air<br />\nService.

HOLLANDER1 FOR ECONOMY<br />\nIn First of a Series of Lectures on Food<br />\nConservation, Dr. Hollander Emphasizes Necessity for Economy.<br /><br />\nDr. Jacob Hollander, professor<br />\nof political economy at this University, in the first of a series of<br />\nlectures to be delivered before the<br />\nWomen's Civic League at McCoy<br />\nHall laid particular stress on the<br />\nfact that in order to bring the nation up to its highest point of efficiency during war-times the manufacture of non-essentials must be<br />\neliminated from the present industrial program.<br />\nHe stated in the course of his<br />\nlecture that the surplus from year<br />\nto year in economic goods is very<br />\nsmall and once the machinery of<br />\nproduction is interrupted a scarcity is bound to occur. \"We are literally living from hand to mouth,\"<br />\nwas the way that Dr. Hollander<br />\nexpressed\u2022 the present situation<br />\nand therefore the maintenance of<br />\nour industries is essential to the<br />\nlife of the nation.<br />\nThe withdrawal of men from<br />\nthe industries is of necessity<br />\nbound to result in the decrease of<br />\nnational income. The situation,<br />\nhowever, is more complicated than<br />\nthis, for these men are not only<br />\nwithdrawn from the mills and factories of the country, but must<br />\nbe fed and clothed.<br />\nDr. Hollander pointed out that<br />\nthere is but one solution to this<br />\nvery grave problem and that is to<br />\nproduce more. He deplored the<br />\nfact that the editorial columns of<br />\nthe daily papers and the magazines of the country have been<br />\nthus far so indifferent to the situation and have not impressed on<br />\nthe people of the nation the necessity for increased saving.<br />\nThe solution of the present problem, as Dr. Hollander sees it, is<br />\nthe elimination of the manufacture of non-essentials. The men,<br />\ncapital and materials that are today going into the manufacture<br />\nof things that are unnecessary<br />\nshould be diverted to make up the<br />\ndeficit that will result when a million men are taken away to carry<br />\non the war.<br />\nDr. Hollander concluded his lecture with a few words of advice<br />\nhow each individual can do his<br />\nbit to win the war. \"Cut your<br />\nspending to the bone,\" he said.\"<br />\n\"Be guided in the running of your<br />\nhousehold by the Food Commission. Convert your saving\u00a7 into<br />\nLiberty Bonds. If working, work<br />\nharder. If idle, work. Just so far<br />\nas the people of the United States<br />\nfall short in these things, just so<br />\nfar do we fail to contribute our<br />\nshare to the winning of the war.\"<br />\nThe next lecture will be delivered by Hon. Edwin G. Baetjer,<br />\nFood Administrator of Maryland,<br />\non \"Food Legislation and Administration,\" on Tuesday, January<br />\n29, 1918.<br /><br />\nNEWS FROM MEN IN SERVICE<br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER wants to devote<br />\nthis page to news of Hopkins men in<br />\nthe service. It is impossible for the<br />\neditors to keep in touch with every<br />\nman in the service; the co-operation of<br />\nthe families and friends of Hopkins<br />\nmen with the colors is earnestly<br />\nsought. THE NEWS-LETTER will be glad<br />\nto publish letters, photographs and general news of men in the service, which<br />\nwill be returned upon request.
