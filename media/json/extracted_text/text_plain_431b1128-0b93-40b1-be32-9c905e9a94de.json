In the seven years of his<br />\nstay at Hopkins Mr. Spalding has been a consistent, patient<br />\nand sympathetic friend of the undergraduate. Unobstrusively, but very effectively he has acted as a liaison between the<br />\nadministration and the student body, always available to<br />\nlend his considerable judgement to any worthwhile project<br />\nand to help further it if possible.<br />\nWe owe a special debt to Mr. Spalding because he has<br />\nvoluntarily assumed the duties of unofficial advisor to the<br />\nNews-Letter, meeting informally with the editors each week<br />\nHis experience and<br />\nto discuss problems and projects.<br />\nadvice has often helped to stabilize our somewhat erratic<br />\ncourse but never, even when he disagrees with us, has he<br />\nattempted to dictate policy.<br />\nThis tact has extended to all phases of Mr. Spalding's<br />\nactivities at Hopkins. He has filled a delicate position<br />\nwith taste, prudence and a sincere interest in the good<br />\nof the 'University. We are sure that these excellent qualities<br />\nwill lead him to success at Franklin and Marshall.<br />\n<br />\nLattimore Sees Recent Mongolian Progress<br />\nNomads<br />\nand<br />\nCommissars:<br />\nMongolia Revisited is an aptly<br />\nnamed travel book which aims<br />\nat \"general description of what<br />\nMongolia and the Mongol people<br />\nare like today, with frequent<br />\nreferences to historical phases of<br />\nchange and development.\" The<br />\nold is contrasted with the new<br />\nthrough the eyes of an experienced Asiatic traveler deeply<br />\nversed in the language, custom,<br />\nand history of his subject. As<br />\nsuch, the book describes the<br />\nMongol's astounding transformation from feudal nomadism to<br />\ntwentieth<br />\ncentury<br />\nsocialism.<br />\nMongolia has truly made 'the<br />\ngreat leap forward' by a combination of the diligence of her<br />\nown people and what Mr. Lattimore regards as the judicious<br />\n<br />\nmaterial and spiritual aid of<br />\nRussia.<br />\nMethodically developing his<br />\nthesis, Mr. Lattimore describes<br />\nthe positive aspects of Mongolia's<br />\nsatellite status (a term he has<br />\ngood claim to have originated)<br />\nand the relation it has to expediency. The Mongols, threatened<br />\nby Chinese and Japanese aggression turned first to tsarist and<br />\nthen communist Russia for their<br />\nmost trusty protector. Because<br />\nMongolian existence depended<br />\nupon outside support, her internal politics tended to reflect the<br />\nsource of that support.

After a<br />\nsemester with no formal rushing procedures, the individual fraternities now have the opportunity to demonstrate<br />\nwhatever advantages they can offer Hopkins freshmen.<br />\nIt would appear that freshmen will flock to the individual fraternity houses tonight and tomorrow night if not<br />\njust for curiosity, in an effort to join a social club which<br />\nwill supplement the severely impersonal social life of<br />\ndormitory students.<br />\nWhile the social advantages of fraternities are greater<br />\nthan those of the dormitory houses, they are also their<br />\nsorest point. In the past fraternities have found no moderation in their social programs. Either the programs have<br />\nbeen overabundant, detracting the fraternity membership<br />\nfrom the campus atmosphere, or they have been too sparse,<br />\nresulting in unsuccessful, overly expensive fraternity<br />\ngroups.<br />\nThe problem seems to be that fraternities have not<br />\nexploited their unique position and have not taken advantage of their abilities to supplement undergraduate life at<br />\nthe University. They have a wonderful opportunity to<br />\nadd to the humanistic traditions of university living by<br />\nproviding the gemiitligkeit severely lacking in the comparatively cold atmosphere of the dormitories. While this<br />\nshould he the primary effect of their social orientation,<br />\nit should not be their sole function.<br />\nFraternities can implement the University atmosphere<br />\nnot only through the support of campus events, but by<br />\nestablishing an atmosphere more consistent with the<br />\nacademic ethos of the University. Some fraternities have<br />\nattempted to do this and have, in effect, added much to<br />\nthe advantages of group membership. They have sponsored plays downtown, concerts in the houses and informal<br />\nsessions with faculty members.<br />\nTo assure themselves of future success they will have<br />\nto seriously attempt to balance social programs, to reconciliate the academic atmosphere and that of fraternalism,<br />\nand to go beyond the fun, games and token social services<br />\nthey perform at present. If they cannot, they will ultimately fail and he replaced by other forms of social organization, or they will fall into dull mediocrity and exist hut<br />\nparasitically on the unique institution which they should<br />\nsupport and supplement.<br />\n<br />\nThe Longest Way Round<br />\nSunday marks the beginning of the Y.M.C.A.'s annual<br />\ncelebration of Brotherhood week. As usual the \"Y\" is<br />\nmarking the occasion, not with a narrow parochial program, but with a schedule of events of interest to the entire<br />\nHopkins Community. This breadth of approach to a topic<br />\nwhich so often evokes meaningless exhortations by longwinded speakers is truly commendable. Dr. Wickwire's<br />\napproach to brotherhood remains the most balanced, and<br />\ntherefore the most effective, way of putting across the<br />\nmessage of Brotherhood Week. It invites participation<br />\nwithout a feeling of moral obligation.<br />\nOn an essentially pagan campus Dr. Wickwire's example serves at least to remind us that there is another way.<br />\n<br />\nilydny<br />\n0942<br />\n<br />\nea44edpandence<br />\nThe News-Letter regrets<br />\nthat it cannot accept unsigned letters for publication.<br />\nHowever names will be withheld upon request.<br />\n<br />\nEditorial Profundity<br />\nThe following letter was written to a graduate student at the<br />\nUniversity by a Professor of<br />\nGovernment at Beloit College in<br />\nBeloit Wisconsin who received<br />\nhis Ph.D. from Hopkins.<br />\nDear Gene:<br />\nThe copy of the News-Letter<br />\nyou sent was here on my arrival<br />\nhome from Mexico. I enjoyed<br />\nlooking it over and, especially,<br />\nthe enclosed editorial.<br />\nThis editorial put into words<br />\na vague feeling which I have<br />\nbeen nursing about today's undergraduates for some time. The<br />\nwriter overstates a bit the position, at least as I have seen it.<br />\nthe overstating is not such as to<br />\ndistort it, however. If this is an<br />\naccurate reporting of today's<br />\nstudent views, it means that<br />\nthere is a considerable difference<br />\nof outlook between the vast majority of college professors (most<br />\nof whom were educated in the<br />\n1930s and exposed to social uplift thinking of that day) and<br />\ntoday's students, a difference of<br />\nsuch magnitude as to create<br />\nquite a gulf. There are, of course,<br />\nvarious undergraduates who are<br />\ninterested in society and its<br />\nproblems (or who can be interested in these two), but I have<br />\nthe definite suspicion that they<br />\nare in a small minority of the<br />\nwhole population.<br />\nThis editorial also led me to<br />\nreflect on the \"gulf\", how wide<br />\nand deep it is. My first reaction<br />\nwas that the gulf was a chasm<br />\nand that present college and<br />\nuniversity teachers were missing their students' vital interests in their writings and teaching by miles and miles. After a<br />\nbit I wasn't so sure.<br />\nFor the sake of discussion, let<br />\n<br />\nus assume that the editorial<br />\nwriter is right, that \"What is<br />\nnot generally appreciated is that<br />\nthe profound social consciousness of previous generations has<br />\ngiven way to an equally profound, often anguished, selfconsciousness.\" Let us also assume that the writer is right<br />\nin that the present concern of<br />\nundergraduates is for making<br />\nhimself into \"what he considers<br />\na worth-while human being.\"<br />\nParenthetically, what a change<br />\nthis portends for our colleges<br />\nand universities in the next generation or two, if it is accurate.<br />\nI am wondering now if this goal<br />\nof individual perfection is so<br />\ncontained and so exclusive that<br />\nconcerns with society are totally excluded. I am also wondering<br />\nif this goal is a new ivory-towerism. I now feel that in its best<br />\nform this goal of individual self<br />\nperfection is not exclusive and<br />\nnot ivory-tower oriented; but<br />\nwhat of it in its baser form, i.e.<br />\nin the form that many non-reflective undergraduates accept<br />\nand act upon, i.e. again, that<br />\nwhich they receive from the<br />\nleaders of campus life and<br />\nthought?<br />\nAny person acting on this<br />\npremise that he is in college to<br />\nlearn to perfect himself must,<br />\nin his honesty, admit that he, as<br />\na human being, is a product of<br />\nsociety largely and that his very<br />\ndefects which he wishes to eradicate are socially initiated and<br />\nto a large degree socially-maintained. Can eradication precede<br />\ndefect-identification and analysis? And can identification and<br />\nanalysis precede or exclude study<br />\nof society and its maladjustments? Perforce, the individual<br />\nmust examine \"the problems<br />\ncurrently facing society as a<br />\nwhole\" because they are reflections of problems of his own<br />\npersonality and spirit, or vice<br />\nversa. Now this doesn't mean<br />\nthat the present day undergraduate student will concern himself<br />\n<br />\n(Continued on Page 5)<br />\n<br />\ncomfort, a kind of tangible progress which has invested this<br />\nsupposedly primitive people with<br />\na hearty confidence in the future.<br />\nOf course the benefits of Mongolian Communism do not come<br />\neasily, nor are the hardships<br />\ncompletely answered by a strict<br />\nadherence to the Marxist or<br />\nComintern line. The fact that<br />\nMongolia is dependent upon Russia clearly does not mean that<br />\nits brand of Communism is a<br />\nslavish caricature of its source.<br />\nPurely environmental realities<br />\nexclude any such thing. In fact,<br />\nas Mr. Lattimore goes to great<br />\nlengths to point out, Communism<br />\nwithout the vestiges of either a<br />\nproletariate or a bourgeoisie, as<br />\nwas and is the case in Mongolia,<br />\nmust assume an altogether different character than a communism within a Western style<br />\nclass structure. Although Mr.<br />\nLattimore does not explicitly say<br />\nso, the point seems to be, at least<br />\nfor Mongolia, that the first category of Communism, without the<br />\nmyth of the bourgeois conspiracy,<br />\nhas a much better chance for a<br />\ndirect development of the Marxist promise of the good life in<br />\nthis life\u2014fewer reprisals, less injustice, more accomplishment.<br />\nAlthough the above precis of<br />\nNomads and Commissars may<br />\nmake the book seem somewhat<br />\nleft of center, such an interpretation completely misses the point<br />\nof Mr. Lattimore's thesis with<br />\nregard to Mongolian-Soviet relations: Mongolia has always<br />\nbeen allied with Russia either<br />\nformerly or otherwise; the alliance of a weaker and a stronger<br />\npower means a change in the<br />\nweaker's outlook. Mongolia's leap<br />\ninto the twentieth century has<br />\ncome in form of Communism.<br />\nThis is a fact. After a harsh<br />\nperiod of adjustment Communism is working for Mongolia, and<br />\nit promises well. The Mongols are<br />\nnot, closed to Western ideas; as<br />\nthe Lattimore trip in the summer<br />\nof 1961 proves; they welcome<br />\ntheir exchange. They are eager<br />\nto learn because they, like everyone else, want to improve themselves.<br />\nAlso, and this is extremely important, the success of their experiment proves that they have<br />\nsomething to teach.

Roommates, I say, are still with us and I<br />\nfear they always will be, so we better learn how to get along<br />\nwith them. It can be done, you know. Take, for instance, the<br />\nclassic case of Dolly Pitcher and Molly Madison.<br />\nDolly and Molly, roommates at a prominent Midwestern<br />\ngirls' school(Vassar) had a problem that seemed insoluble. Dolly<br />\ncould only study late at night, and Molly could not stay awake<br />\npast nine o'clock. If Dolly kept the lights on, the room was too<br />\nbright for Molly to sleep. If Molly turned the lights off, the<br />\nroom was too dark for Dolly to study. What to do?<br />\nWell sir, those two intelligent American kids found an answer. They got a miner's cap for Dolly! Thus, she had enough<br />\nlight to study by, and still the room was dark enough for<br />\nMolly to sleep.<br />\nIt must be admitted, however, that this solution, ingenious<br />\nas it was, had some unexpected sequelae. Dolly got SO enchanted with her miner's cap that she switched her major from<br />\nlbth Century poetry to mining and metallurgy. Shortly after<br />\ngraduation she had what appeared to be a great stroke of luck:<br />\nwhile out prospecting, she discovered what is without question<br />\nthe world's largest feldspar mine. This might have made Dolly<br />\nvery rich except that nobody, alas, has yet discovered a use for<br />\nfeldspar. Today Dolly, a broken woman, squeezes out a meagre<br />\nliving making echoes for tourists in Mammoth Cave.<br />\nNor has Molly fared conspicuously better. Once Dolly got<br />\nthe miner's hat, Molly was able to catch up on her long-lost<br />\nsleep. She woke after eight days, refreshed and vigorous\u2014more<br />\nvigorous, alas, than she realized. It was the afternoon of the<br />\nannual Dean's tea. Molly stood in line with her classmates,<br />\nwaiting to shake the Dean's hand. At last her turn came, and<br />\nMolly, full of strength and health, gave the Dean a firm handshake\u2014so firm, indeed, that all five of the Dean's knuckles<br />\nwere permanently fused.<br />\nThe Dean sued for a million dollars, and, of course, won. Today Molly, a broken woman, is paying off her debt by walking<br />\nthe Dean's cat every afternoon for ten cents an hour.<br />\nin 1983 Max Bbulms*<br />\n<br />\nWe,the makers of Marlboro and the sponsors oft his column,<br />\nwill not attempt to expertize about roommates.

There are, however, a<br />\nnumber of people on the Homewood scene who contribute as<br />\nmuch to the overall picture of<br />\nsports as do the basketball players and wrestlers. These people<br />\nare working hard to establish<br />\nHopkins sports, and make them<br />\nmore enjoyable and entertaining.<br />\nFive stand out. Of these, one<br />\nis connected with a varsity sport,<br />\ntwo are trying to promote sports<br />\nwhich are not on the varsity list,<br />\nand two are emblematic of the<br />\nmost important people on the<br />\nHopkins sports scene\u2014the fans.<br />\nIn order, the first of these is<br />\nTim Koehler, co-captain of the<br />\nvarsity fencing squad. Along with<br />\nlacrosse and tennis, fencing is<br />\nprobably the most successful<br />\nsport at Hopkins, and is certainly the most successful winter<br />\nsport. This year's team ought<br />\nto win the conference championships (and, as if in anticipation<br />\nof a Blue Jay victory, the championships are to be held at Hopkins on March 1-2), and Coach<br />\nDick Oles once made the boast<br />\nthat he had had more men out<br />\nfor fencing than he had for football.<br />\nKoehler's Problems<br />\nKoehler's problems as captain,<br />\nhowever, are different from those<br />\nof any other Hopkins captain.<br />\nHe is in charge of a good team,<br />\nbut nobody knows about it.<br />\nHence, he has the job of not<br />\nonly keeping morale high, but<br />\nkeeping it high in the face of<br />\nconsistent indifferenec to the<br />\n<br />\nsport on the part of the general<br />\npublic. The team fences in the<br />\nROTC building instead of in the<br />\ngym, something which causes<br />\nhim to grumble, \"Intramural<br />\nbasketball gets precedence over<br />\nvarsity fencing . . . \" Koehler<br />\nhas one other pet gripe,\" . the<br />\nHopkins team has been invited<br />\nto several outside fencing tournaments, including the North<br />\nAtlantic Championships, but if<br />\nwe go, we have to pay our own<br />\nway.\" He feels that if the team<br />\nis of championship caliber, it<br />\nshould be allowed to try to bring<br />\nback the North Atlantic Championship, at anw rate. He claims<br />\nthe team is capable of doing<br />\nthis.<br />\nKoehler, however, captains a<br />\nvarsity sport. Bob Kittredge and<br />\nDon Clewell do not have that<br />\nadvantage.

Friendly with all of<br />\nthe athletes, they are always<br />\nwilling to talk sports; and each<br />\nhas several interesting ideas concerning the improvement of<br />\nHopkins sports, at least from<br />\nthe spectator point of view.

Who will replace<br />\nClewell as head of the swimming<br />\nproject, something with which<br />\nhe has lived for two years? Will<br />\nthe Hockey Club fold when ICittredge graduates, or will there be<br />\nsomeone who can organize it as<br />\nwell? And, finally, will next year<br />\nbring two fans as devoted as<br />\nNordmann and Cagan?

Catholic is a<br />\nvery good ball club that plays<br />\nsuch teams as Mt. St. Mary's<br />\nand Providence. Dickinson is a<br />\nMiddle Atlantic Conference team<br />\nthat has a record similar to that<br />\nof Johns Hopkins.<br />\n<br />\nhigh at sixteen. Senior Dick Carroll scored thirteen, Bill Characklis had thirteen, Homer Schwartz<br />\nhad ten, and Mike Ratner, returning to form, also hit ten. The<br />\nvastly improved defense held<br />\nDick Eigen scoreless, and also<br />\nkept Tom O'Malley scoreless in<br />\nthe second half.<br />\n<br />\nFor the Terrors, Richie Klitzberg was once again the big gun<br />\nas he dunked in 20 big points,<br />\nLast Friday at the Homewood but they were to no avail as<br />\ngymnasium, the Western Mary- the final score indicated. The<br />\nland Green Terrors came to Jays as a team shot well over<br />\nthe 50% mark, both from the<br />\nfield and from the foul line, as<br />\nFLASH<br />\nopposed to the 40% shooting of<br />\nthe Terrors. It was simply a<br />\nLoyola 5 Beats Jays<br />\ncase of the Jays being too hot<br />\n70-57<br />\nfor Western Maryland.<br />\nJohns Hopkins with an eight<br />\ngame winning streak against the<br />\nJays and leading the MasonDixon Conference. After the<br />\ngame, they were still in first<br />\nplace, but had suffered their first<br />\nloss in three years to a Hopkins<br />\nteam. The score was 70-53.<br />\nTremendous Effort<br />\nIn a game that coach Sachs<br />\ntermed a tremendous team effort, the Jays did everything<br />\nright.

This organization<br />\nbestows the grant of $1000 for<br />\nthe best submitted dissertation<br />\nin American Studies.<br />\nThe prize is significant not<br />\nonly for the affirmation of superior scholarship and for the<br />\nmonetary stipend, but it may<br />\nforetell a meaningful career for<br />\nMrs. Rose. The $1000 is donated<br />\nby ten publishing houses in New<br />\nYork, one of which is most probable to publish the Thesis and<br />\ncontinue to support and publish<br />\nworks by the same author,<br />\nMrs. Rose, an attractive, earnest woman, is overjoyed with her<br />\nsuccess and most thankful for<br />\nher apparently bright future.<br />\nMore impressive, however, is her<br />\nextreme interest and devotion to<br />\nher studies. The winning dissertation was entitled Rehearsal for<br />\nReconstruction and concerned a<br />\ngroup of islands off South Carolina where a peculiarly advanced<br />\nform of Negro rehabilitation and<br />\neducation took place during and<br />\nafter the Civil War.

In the seven years of his<br />\nstay at Hopkins Mr. Spalding has been a consistent, patient<br />\nand sympathetic friend of the undergraduate. Unobstrusively, but very effectively he has acted as a liaison between the<br />\nadministration and the student body, always available to<br />\nlend his considerable judgement to any worthwhile project<br />\nand to help further it if possible.<br />\nWe owe a special debt to Mr. Spalding because he has<br />\nvoluntarily assumed the duties of unofficial advisor to the<br />\nNews-Letter, meeting informally with the editors each week<br />\nHis experience and<br />\nto discuss problems and projects.<br />\nadvice has often helped to stabilize our somewhat erratic<br />\ncourse but never, even when he disagrees with us, has he<br />\nattempted to dictate policy.<br />\nThis tact has extended to all phases of Mr. Spalding's<br />\nactivities at Hopkins. He has filled a delicate position<br />\nwith taste, prudence and a sincere interest in the good<br />\nof the 'University.

Because<br />\nMongolian existence depended<br />\nupon outside support, her internal politics tended to reflect the<br />\nsource of that support.

After a<br />\nsemester with no formal rushing procedures, the individual fraternities now have the opportunity to demonstrate<br />\nwhatever advantages they can offer Hopkins freshmen.<br />\nIt would appear that freshmen will flock to the individual fraternity houses tonight and tomorrow night if not<br />\njust for curiosity, in an effort to join a social club which<br />\nwill supplement the severely impersonal social life of<br />\ndormitory students.<br />\nWhile the social advantages of fraternities are greater<br />\nthan those of the dormitory houses, they are also their<br />\nsorest point. In the past fraternities have found no moderation in their social programs. Either the programs have<br />\nbeen overabundant, detracting the fraternity membership<br />\nfrom the campus atmosphere, or they have been too sparse,<br />\nresulting in unsuccessful, overly expensive fraternity<br />\ngroups.<br />\nThe problem seems to be that fraternities have not<br />\nexploited their unique position and have not taken advantage of their abilities to supplement undergraduate life at<br />\nthe University. They have a wonderful opportunity to<br />\nadd to the humanistic traditions of university living by<br />\nproviding the gemiitligkeit severely lacking in the comparatively cold atmosphere of the dormitories. While this<br />\nshould he the primary effect of their social orientation,<br />\nit should not be their sole function.<br />\nFraternities can implement the University atmosphere<br />\nnot only through the support of campus events, but by<br />\nestablishing an atmosphere more consistent with the<br />\nacademic ethos of the University. Some fraternities have<br />\nattempted to do this and have, in effect, added much to<br />\nthe advantages of group membership. They have sponsored plays downtown, concerts in the houses and informal<br />\nsessions with faculty members.<br />\nTo assure themselves of future success they will have<br />\nto seriously attempt to balance social programs, to reconciliate the academic atmosphere and that of fraternalism,<br />\nand to go beyond the fun, games and token social services<br />\nthey perform at present. If they cannot, they will ultimately fail and he replaced by other forms of social organization, or they will fall into dull mediocrity and exist hut<br />\nparasitically on the unique institution which they should<br />\nsupport and supplement.<br /><br />\nThe Longest Way Round<br />\nSunday marks the beginning of the Y.M.C.A.'s annual<br />\ncelebration of Brotherhood week. As usual the \"Y\" is<br />\nmarking the occasion, not with a narrow parochial program, but with a schedule of events of interest to the entire<br />\nHopkins Community. This breadth of approach to a topic<br />\nwhich so often evokes meaningless exhortations by longwinded speakers is truly commendable. Dr. Wickwire's<br />\napproach to brotherhood remains the most balanced, and<br />\ntherefore the most effective, way of putting across the<br />\nmessage of Brotherhood Week. It invites participation<br />\nwithout a feeling of moral obligation.<br />\nOn an essentially pagan campus Dr. Wickwire's example serves at least to remind us that there is another way.<br /><br />\nilydny<br />\n0942<br /><br />\nea44edpandence<br />\nThe News-Letter regrets<br />\nthat it cannot accept unsigned letters for publication.<br />\nHowever names will be withheld upon request.<br /><br />\nEditorial Profundity<br />\nThe following letter was written to a graduate student at the<br />\nUniversity by a Professor of<br />\nGovernment at Beloit College in<br />\nBeloit Wisconsin who received<br />\nhis Ph.D. from Hopkins.<br />\nDear Gene:<br />\nThe copy of the News-Letter<br />\nyou sent was here on my arrival<br />\nhome from Mexico. I enjoyed<br />\nlooking it over and, especially,<br />\nthe enclosed editorial.<br />\nThis editorial put into words<br />\na vague feeling which I have<br />\nbeen nursing about today's undergraduates for some time. The<br />\nwriter overstates a bit the position, at least as I have seen it.<br />\nthe overstating is not such as to<br />\ndistort it, however. If this is an<br />\naccurate reporting of today's<br />\nstudent views, it means that<br />\nthere is a considerable difference<br />\nof outlook between the vast majority of college professors (most<br />\nof whom were educated in the<br />\n1930s and exposed to social uplift thinking of that day) and<br />\ntoday's students, a difference of<br />\nsuch magnitude as to create<br />\nquite a gulf. There are, of course,<br />\nvarious undergraduates who are<br />\ninterested in society and its<br />\nproblems (or who can be interested in these two), but I have<br />\nthe definite suspicion that they<br />\nare in a small minority of the<br />\nwhole population.<br />\nThis editorial also led me to<br />\nreflect on the \"gulf\", how wide<br />\nand deep it is. My first reaction<br />\nwas that the gulf was a chasm<br />\nand that present college and<br />\nuniversity teachers were missing their students' vital interests in their writings and teaching by miles and miles. After a<br />\nbit I wasn't so sure.<br />\nFor the sake of discussion, let<br /><br />\nus assume that the editorial<br />\nwriter is right, that \"What is<br />\nnot generally appreciated is that<br />\nthe profound social consciousness of previous generations has<br />\ngiven way to an equally profound, often anguished, selfconsciousness.\" Let us also assume that the writer is right<br />\nin that the present concern of<br />\nundergraduates is for making<br />\nhimself into \"what he considers<br />\na worth-while human being.\"<br />\nParenthetically, what a change<br />\nthis portends for our colleges<br />\nand universities in the next generation or two, if it is accurate.<br />\nI am wondering now if this goal<br />\nof individual perfection is so<br />\ncontained and so exclusive that<br />\nconcerns with society are totally excluded. I am also wondering<br />\nif this goal is a new ivory-towerism. I now feel that in its best<br />\nform this goal of individual self<br />\nperfection is not exclusive and<br />\nnot ivory-tower oriented; but<br />\nwhat of it in its baser form, i.e.<br />\nin the form that many non-reflective undergraduates accept<br />\nand act upon, i.e. again, that<br />\nwhich they receive from the<br />\nleaders of campus life and<br />\nthought?<br />\nAny person acting on this<br />\npremise that he is in college to<br />\nlearn to perfect himself must,<br />\nin his honesty, admit that he, as<br />\na human being, is a product of<br />\nsociety largely and that his very<br />\ndefects which he wishes to eradicate are socially initiated and<br />\nto a large degree socially-maintained. Can eradication precede<br />\ndefect-identification and analysis? And can identification and<br />\nanalysis precede or exclude study<br />\nof society and its maladjustments? Perforce, the individual<br />\nmust examine \"the problems<br />\ncurrently facing society as a<br />\nwhole\" because they are reflections of problems of his own<br />\npersonality and spirit, or vice<br />\nversa. Now this doesn't mean<br />\nthat the present day undergraduate student will concern himself<br /><br />\n(Continued on Page 5)<br /><br />\ncomfort, a kind of tangible progress which has invested this<br />\nsupposedly primitive people with<br />\na hearty confidence in the future.<br />\nOf course the benefits of Mongolian Communism do not come<br />\neasily, nor are the hardships<br />\ncompletely answered by a strict<br />\nadherence to the Marxist or<br />\nComintern line. The fact that<br />\nMongolia is dependent upon Russia clearly does not mean that<br />\nits brand of Communism is a<br />\nslavish caricature of its source.<br />\nPurely environmental realities<br />\nexclude any such thing. In fact,<br />\nas Mr. Lattimore goes to great<br />\nlengths to point out, Communism<br />\nwithout the vestiges of either a<br />\nproletariate or a bourgeoisie, as<br />\nwas and is the case in Mongolia,<br />\nmust assume an altogether different character than a communism within a Western style<br />\nclass structure. Although Mr.<br />\nLattimore does not explicitly say<br />\nso, the point seems to be, at least<br />\nfor Mongolia, that the first category of Communism, without the<br />\nmyth of the bourgeois conspiracy,<br />\nhas a much better chance for a<br />\ndirect development of the Marxist promise of the good life in<br />\nthis life\u2014fewer reprisals, less injustice, more accomplishment.<br />\nAlthough the above precis of<br />\nNomads and Commissars may<br />\nmake the book seem somewhat<br />\nleft of center, such an interpretation completely misses the point<br />\nof Mr. Lattimore's thesis with<br />\nregard to Mongolian-Soviet relations: Mongolia has always<br />\nbeen allied with Russia either<br />\nformerly or otherwise; the alliance of a weaker and a stronger<br />\npower means a change in the<br />\nweaker's outlook. Mongolia's leap<br />\ninto the twentieth century has<br />\ncome in form of Communism.<br />\nThis is a fact. After a harsh<br />\nperiod of adjustment Communism is working for Mongolia, and<br />\nit promises well. The Mongols are<br />\nnot, closed to Western ideas; as<br />\nthe Lattimore trip in the summer<br />\nof 1961 proves; they welcome<br />\ntheir exchange. They are eager<br />\nto learn because they, like everyone else, want to improve themselves.<br />\nAlso, and this is extremely important, the success of their experiment proves that they have<br />\nsomething to teach.

Dolly<br />\ncould only study late at night, and Molly could not stay awake<br />\npast nine o'clock. If Dolly kept the lights on, the room was too<br />\nbright for Molly to sleep. If Molly turned the lights off, the<br />\nroom was too dark for Dolly to study. What to do?<br />\nWell sir, those two intelligent American kids found an answer. They got a miner's cap for Dolly! Thus, she had enough<br />\nlight to study by, and still the room was dark enough for<br />\nMolly to sleep.<br />\nIt must be admitted, however, that this solution, ingenious<br />\nas it was, had some unexpected sequelae. Dolly got SO enchanted with her miner's cap that she switched her major from<br />\nlbth Century poetry to mining and metallurgy. Shortly after<br />\ngraduation she had what appeared to be a great stroke of luck:<br />\nwhile out prospecting, she discovered what is without question<br />\nthe world's largest feldspar mine. This might have made Dolly<br />\nvery rich except that nobody, alas, has yet discovered a use for<br />\nfeldspar. Today Dolly, a broken woman, squeezes out a meagre<br />\nliving making echoes for tourists in Mammoth Cave.<br />\nNor has Molly fared conspicuously better. Once Dolly got<br />\nthe miner's hat, Molly was able to catch up on her long-lost<br />\nsleep. She woke after eight days, refreshed and vigorous\u2014more<br />\nvigorous, alas, than she realized.

There are, however, a<br />\nnumber of people on the Homewood scene who contribute as<br />\nmuch to the overall picture of<br />\nsports as do the basketball players and wrestlers. These people<br />\nare working hard to establish<br />\nHopkins sports, and make them<br />\nmore enjoyable and entertaining.<br />\nFive stand out. Of these, one<br />\nis connected with a varsity sport,<br />\ntwo are trying to promote sports<br />\nwhich are not on the varsity list,<br />\nand two are emblematic of the<br />\nmost important people on the<br />\nHopkins sports scene\u2014the fans.<br />\nIn order, the first of these is<br />\nTim Koehler, co-captain of the<br />\nvarsity fencing squad. Along with<br />\nlacrosse and tennis, fencing is<br />\nprobably the most successful<br />\nsport at Hopkins, and is certainly the most successful winter<br />\nsport. This year's team ought<br />\nto win the conference championships (and, as if in anticipation<br />\nof a Blue Jay victory, the championships are to be held at Hopkins on March 1-2), and Coach<br />\nDick Oles once made the boast<br />\nthat he had had more men out<br />\nfor fencing than he had for football.<br />\nKoehler's Problems<br />\nKoehler's problems as captain,<br />\nhowever, are different from those<br />\nof any other Hopkins captain.<br />\nHe is in charge of a good team,<br />\nbut nobody knows about it.<br />\nHence, he has the job of not<br />\nonly keeping morale high, but<br />\nkeeping it high in the face of<br />\nconsistent indifferenec to the<br /><br />\nsport on the part of the general<br />\npublic. The team fences in the<br />\nROTC building instead of in the<br />\ngym, something which causes<br />\nhim to grumble, \"Intramural<br />\nbasketball gets precedence over<br />\nvarsity fencing . . . \" Koehler<br />\nhas one other pet gripe,\" . the<br />\nHopkins team has been invited<br />\nto several outside fencing tournaments, including the North<br />\nAtlantic Championships, but if<br />\nwe go, we have to pay our own<br />\nway.\" He feels that if the team<br />\nis of championship caliber, it<br />\nshould be allowed to try to bring<br />\nback the North Atlantic Championship, at anw rate. He claims<br />\nthe team is capable of doing<br />\nthis.<br />\nKoehler, however, captains a<br />\nvarsity sport. Bob Kittredge and<br />\nDon Clewell do not have that<br />\nadvantage. Clewell is not a well<br />\nknown figure around campus,<br />\nbut he has, within two short<br />\nyears, brought the swimming<br />\nclub from an idea in his mind<br />\nto a reality, and has secured for<br />\nit the promise of varsity status<br />\nwithin two more years.<br />\nHockey Club<br />\nKittredge's hockey club is in<br />\nthe first year of its existence,<br />\nand is not, at this writing, gunning for varsity status.

Clewell<br />\nhas had difficulty in persuading<br />\nfreshmen to compete, since there<br />\n, is no possibility of their swimming in the Mason-Dixon Conference championships.

Catholic is a<br />\nvery good ball club that plays<br />\nsuch teams as Mt. St. Mary's<br />\nand Providence. Dickinson is a<br />\nMiddle Atlantic Conference team<br />\nthat has a record similar to that<br />\nof Johns Hopkins.<br /><br />\nhigh at sixteen. Senior Dick Carroll scored thirteen, Bill Characklis had thirteen, Homer Schwartz<br />\nhad ten, and Mike Ratner, returning to form, also hit ten. The<br />\nvastly improved defense held<br />\nDick Eigen scoreless, and also<br />\nkept Tom O'Malley scoreless in<br />\nthe second half.<br /><br />\nFor the Terrors, Richie Klitzberg was once again the big gun<br />\nas he dunked in 20 big points,<br />\nLast Friday at the Homewood but they were to no avail as<br />\ngymnasium, the Western Mary- the final score indicated. The<br />\nland Green Terrors came to Jays as a team shot well over<br />\nthe 50% mark, both from the<br />\nfield and from the foul line, as<br />\nFLASH<br />\nopposed to the 40% shooting of<br />\nthe Terrors. It was simply a<br />\nLoyola 5 Beats Jays<br />\ncase of the Jays being too hot<br />\n70-57<br />\nfor Western Maryland.<br />\nJohns Hopkins with an eight<br />\ngame winning streak against the<br />\nJays and leading the MasonDixon Conference. After the<br />\ngame, they were still in first<br />\nplace, but had suffered their first<br />\nloss in three years to a Hopkins<br />\nteam. The score was 70-53.<br />\nTremendous Effort<br />\nIn a game that coach Sachs<br />\ntermed a tremendous team effort, the Jays did everything<br />\nright. Five players hit in the<br />\ndouble figures with Paul Krouner<br /><br />\nWith this victory, the series,<br />\nwhich started with a 38-34 victory for Hopkins in 1931, now<br />\nstands 37-26 in favor of the<br />\nTerrors.<br />\nJays Lose<br />\nJohns Hopkins did not fare<br />\nas well the following night<br />\nagainst Ursinus at Collegeville,<br />\nPenna., as they lost a thriller<br />\n65-63. Coach Sachs termed<br />\nthe loss to the tail-end team in<br />\nthe MAC a \"bitter pill.\" However, he did not take anything<br />\naway from the Ursinus team,<br />\nsaying \"they were as hot as we<br /><br />\nwere Friday night.\" Five Ursinus<br />\nplayers, including Walter Dryfoss made double figures as they<br />\nhit over 50% of their shots.<br />\nHopkins also shot well (40%)<br />\nand even scored three more field<br />\ngoals. The outcome of the game<br />\nwas told on the foul line again.<br />\nThe Jays did fine, hitting 7-9,<br />\nbut they didn't get enough opportunities at the line.<br />\nHigh scorer for Hopkins was<br />\nagain Paul Krouner with sixteen,<br />\nfollowed by Dick Carroll with<br />\nfourteen and Bill Characklis with<br />\ntwelve.<br /><br />\nRush<br />\nThe fraternitie OPEN houses<br />\nscheduled during this year's<br />\nrushing-periad are open to all<br />\nfreshmen even though some<br />\nfraternities have handed out<br />\ninvitations.<br /><br />\nthe last four years, serving as<br />\nthe pro at the Gibson Island<br />\nClub for three of these years,<br />\nand at the St. Timothy's Club<br />\nin Catonsville for one year.

However, if a man<br />\ncan meet our quality standards and feels that<br />\nhe is really just beginning to learn... and if he<br />\nis ready to launch his career where learning is<br />\nan important part of the job and where graduate-level training on and off the job is encouraged \u2014 we want and need him.<br />\nAt Western Electric, in addition to the normal learning-while-doing, engineers are encouraged to move ahead in their fields by several types of educational programs. Western<br />\nmaintains its own full-time graduate engineering training program, seven formal management courses, and a tuition refund plan for<br />\nout-of-hours college study.<br />\nThis learning atmosphere is just one reason<br />\nwhy a career at Western Electric is so stimulating.
