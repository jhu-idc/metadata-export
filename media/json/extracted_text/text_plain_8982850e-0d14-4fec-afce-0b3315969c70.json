Krueger did not rule out a<br />\ndeficit next year completely,<br />\nhowever, \"Hopefully we can<br />\nkeep it down to a small amout or<br />\neven balance the budget,\" he<br />\nstated.<br />\nFactors<br />\nKrueger noted two factors<br />\nwhich have improved the outlook<br />\nfor the budget next year. The<br />\nrate of inflation has been<br />\ndeclining and is expected to<br />\ncontinue to drop. Also, a $5.5<br />\nmillion grant was made to the<br />\nUniversity in the will of John L.<br />\nPratt, a former trustee who died<br />\nin January.<br />\nThese favorable events were<br />\nnot counted on previously when<br />\nthe prediction of a deficit was<br />\nmade. Other expected increases<br />\nin revenues, along with spending<br />\ncuts, have made budget balance<br />\nfor 1976-77 a possibility.<br />\nThe budget recommendation<br />\nfor 1976-77 will be submitted to<br />\nthe audit committee of the<br />\ntrustees March 22, Krueger<br />\nstated. In that recommendation,<br />\nit will be determined whether a<br />\nbalanced budget can be achieved.<br />\nCurrently, a balanced budget is<br />\nPresident Muller's goal, according<br />\nto Krueger.<br />\n<br />\nRobert C. Bowie,<br />\nVice-President for, Business<br />\nManagement, termed the chances<br />\nfor a balanced budget next year<br />\ngood. \"Compared with what We<br />\nwere looking at in December,<br />\nyes, the situation looks much<br />\nbetter,\" he commented.<br />\nBowie pointed out, however,<br />\nthat fiscal conditions next year<br />\ncould vary considerable from<br />\nwhat is currently projected.<br />\nSpecifically, he cited the recent<br />\npostage increase and deregulation<br />\nof natural gas as items which<br />\ncould be costly next year.<br />\nUnexpected factors could also<br />\nsave money, Bowie stated. \"This<br />\nyear, nothing has helped us more<br />\nthan a warm month of<br />\nFebruary,\" he noted.<br />\n\"I don't see the situation<br />\ngetting any better for the next<br />\nthree or four years,\" he stated.<br />\n\"It's going to be tight. Some<br />\neconomists have predicted<br />\nanother recession worse than the<br />\none we had last year, and<br />\nhand-in-hand with recession<br />\ncomes inflation.\"<br />\nBowie thinks a balanced<br />\nbudget helps gain access to more<br />\nmoney. \"Personally, I think that<br />\ndonors would rather put their<br />\nmoney into a balanced budget<br />\nthan one which is in the red,\" he<br />\nstated.<br />\nOne foctor which has not<br />\ngreatly affected the fiscal<br />\nsituation at Hopkins, Bowie said,<br />\nis the rise in value of stocks on<br />\nthe exchange. Even though the<br />\nvalue of the University's<br />\n<br />\nendowment has increased,<br />\ndividends paid out to the<br />\nUniversity have remained<br />\nconstant.<br />\n<br />\ndrives have raised approximately<br />\n$65,000 a year, not nearly what<br />\nthe conservatory needs to<br />\nsurvive.<br />\nFrom a high of S6 million in<br />\n1972, the endowment has<br />\ndropped to a current low of S3.5<br />\nmillion. Reduction of<br />\nendowment capital results in a<br />\nfall in income, creating a<br />\ndownward spiral of liquid assets.<br />\nThe future status of the<br />\nendowment is in serious doubt<br />\nbecause scholarships are pulled<br />\nfrom the fund, which will result<br />\nin either depletion of the<br />\nendowment or the reduction in<br />\nscholarship aid, either of which<br />\nwould likely destroy<br />\nPeabody. Established by<br />\nGeorge Peabody in the 1850's<br />\nand 1860's with a $1.4 million<br />\ngrant, because of a dearth of<br />\ncultural activities, the Peabody<br />\noriginally encompassed a number<br />\nof areas: a research and reference<br />\nlibrary; an art collection; a<br />\nlecture series in the fields of art,<br />\nscience, and education; and an<br />\nacademy of music. Only the<br />\nConservatory remains.<br />\nWhile the Institute was being<br />\nformulated, George Peabody met<br />\nwith Johns Hopkins who was<br />\nconsidering the creation of a<br />\n<br />\nphilanthropic foundation at the<br />\ntime. Within twenty-four hours<br />\nof that meeting, Johns Hopkins<br />\nmade out his will establishing the<br />\nUniversity and Medical School<br />\nwhich bear his name.<br />\nUpon the death of Hopkins,<br />\nDaniel Coit Gilman left his<br />\neducational post at Berkely to<br />\naccept this University's<br />\npresidency. The existence of the<br />\nPeabody Library in Baltimore<br />\nwas a major factor in Gilman's<br />\ndecision; in -fact, selection of the<br />\nUniversity's original site was<br />\nbased, in part, upon easy access<br />\nto the library.<br />\nIn view of the past relationship<br />\nbetween these two institutions,<br />\nWoolf pointed out \"the<br />\nappropriateness of celebrating<br />\nour centennial by establishing an<br />\naffiliation with the Peabody.\"<br />\nA meeting will occur next<br />\nweek between the committees<br />\nappointed by the involved<br />\nparties.

The Instant Lottery has<br />\nfolks from Salisbury to<br />\nGaithesburg madly scraping away<br />\ntheir Sunday mornings, lunch<br />\nbreaks, and midnight beer<br />\npick-ups. Why the sensation?<br />\nThe old lottery made its share<br />\nof money (and still does), but<br />\ninstantaneous attraction was<br />\nlacking. One would sit around for<br />\na week, possibly losing the ticket<br />\nor forgetting to check the<br />\npaper\u2014no immediate interest. A<br />\nweekly drawing was held on<br />\ntelevision to lure all the<br />\ngame-show fanatics, but that<br />\nseemed an endless procession of<br />\nold ladies with shopping bags,<br />\nbabbling about their $1000 prize.<br />\nBetter the numbers or the horses,<br />\nthan this stultifying scheme.<br />\nThen, however, some genius<br />\nemerged from the labyrinthine<br />\nrecesses of the state bureaucracy,<br />\nand cried, \"I have it! Instant<br />\nlottery! Instant redemption!<br />\nCatholic appeal!\" The wheels<br />\nbegan to turn, the presses rolled,<br />\nand three weeks ago The Day<br />\narrived. The New Maryland<br />\nInstant Lottery had been<br />\nunleashed.<br />\nMy gambling acquaintance, the<br />\nMan from New York, still had<br />\nabout $200 left from a big exacta<br />\nwin at Bowie, so he decided to<br />\nventure into this new, legal<br />\nwagering system. It promised the<br />\nbest odds in the country\u2014better<br />\n<br />\nthan one winner in ten, and only<br />\n$1 a try\u2014and possessed people<br />\nby its wonderful simplicity:<br />\nmerely match three cash amounts<br />\nout of six boxes. Sixty dollars of<br />\ntickets bought at 8 a.m. at the<br />\ndrug store returned twenty, and<br />\nthat amount was continually<br />\nreinvested until it diminished to<br />\nthe zero point. The Man from<br />\nNew York's strategy (as<br />\nexplicated by Kenny the Horse),<br />\n'although an initial failure, was<br />\nsound in fortune: keep playing<br />\nuntil one hits a big prize, and<br />\nthen pull out.<br />\n\u2022<br />\nBig Wins<br />\nThe really extraordinary<br />\npay-offs are $10,000 and $1000,<br />\nbut one shouldn't sit in the Blue<br />\nJay scraping away in eager<br />\nanticipation. After a consistent<br />\namount of playing, a fifty or<br />\nhundred dollar prize will appear,<br />\nand then one retires to a<br />\nweekend of leisure. The two and<br />\nfive dollar winners should be<br />\ntraded in on the spot for more<br />\ntickets; the more cautious may<br />\nrecoup their original investment<br />\nand work from there.<br />\nThe veteran lottery-player will<br />\nlearn the nuances of the game, be<br />\nable to spot a likely winner after<br />\nrubbing out only a few boxes.<br />\nNovices often ask: should you<br />\nsell a four-box two-way split for<br />\nifty cents, scrape out the lower<br />\nieft-hand corner before or after<br />\nthe upper right-hand corner, and<br />\nsuchlike pertinent questions.<br />\nKnowledge, verily, comes only<br />\n<br />\nwith experience (and money).<br />\nTake a seat at the bar, pull out a<br />\nroll of dusty bills (buy a few<br />\ndrinks to keep the bartender on<br />\nyour good side), and get into it.<br />\nA hint for the beginner: the<br />\nlower right-hand corner box, if a<br />\ntwo or a five, is very likely a<br />\nwinner! By all means, scrape that<br />\none first. Spelling<br />\nThe inventor of this<br />\nmagnificent game did not stop at<br />\ncreating a bait for quick winners.<br />\nMimesis, he knew and did not<br />\nfear. Let the losers in life get up<br />\noff the canvas and come battling<br />\nback for another shot. Thus the<br />\nlower portion of the ticket, the<br />\nstub, conceals a letter\u2014if one<br />\nspells \"MARYLAND\" or<br />\n\"INSTANT\", $1000 or $100 is<br />\nwon. By now, of course, key<br />\nletters have been identified: an R<br />\nor S will reap ample reward. The<br />\ncommon letters spell out a<br />\nvariety of words (the deviser was<br />\ncareful to prevent any possible<br />\nobscenities) of interest:<br />\n\"MANDAL\"(sorry, no E)would<br />\npresumably get you an<br />\nindictment.<br />\nThe lottery craze threatens to<br />\nturn the Friday paycheck lines<br />\ninto ticket-distribution centers.<br />\nThe mania can strike any<br />\ninnocent wage-earner. As an<br />\nultimate goal, the Grand Prize<br />\nDrawing yields $500 a week for<br />\nlife; the lucky winner obtains the<br />\ndistinct pleasure of being able to<br />\nbuy five hundred tickets a week.<br />\n<br />\n\u2022?.<br />\n<br />\nIlany Woolf<br />\n<br />\nJump from undergrad<br />\nto law school is big<br />\nBy JAN HAMMERMAN<br />\n\"One of the biggest<br />\nadjustments in going from an<br />\nundergraduate institution to law<br />\nschool is that the intellectual<br />\nenvironment of the former<br />\nemphasizes answers while the<br />\nlatter poses questions,\" asserts<br />\nAbe Kronsberg, a law student at<br />\nthe University of Maryland.<br />\nKronsberg, a Hopkins<br />\nalumnus, contends that there is<br />\nmore interplay between the pupil<br />\nand professor in law school due<br />\nto the Socratic method of<br />\nteaching. This system uses a<br />\nseries of questions from the<br />\nteacher directed to individual<br />\nstudents as a means of<br />\nreinforcing legal principles.<br />\n\"Whereas the scholar is<br />\nsupporting a certain thesis which<br />\nhe has presumably spent years<br />\ndeveloping, the lawyer's task is to<br />\nadvocate a certain position<br />\nrelating to a unique set of<br />\ncircumstances,\" said Kronsberg.<br />\nExams<br />\nThis difference in teaching<br />\nstyle is reflected in law<br />\nex aminations. \"In law school<br />\nthere are more 'open question'<br />\ntests which demand a set of<br />\nanswers rather than one reply,\"<br />\nhe offered. Also, in law courses<br />\none final test, usually three hours<br />\nlong, is the sole . criterion of<br />\ngrades. Professors mark the final<br />\non a 'blind system'--that is,<br />\nwithout knowledge of whom has<br />\ntaken which exam.<br />\nKronsberg regards the ability<br />\nto \"read large amounts of<br />\nmaterial, glean from that material<br />\nkey principles, and then put<br />\nthose concepts into a system\" as<br />\nthe most important skill in law<br />\nschool. \"One must be able to<br />\nread 1000 pages of texts and boil<br />\nit down to a twenty page<br />\noutline-but one which covers the<br />\nentire scope of the subject,\" he<br />\nexplained.<br />\nKnowledge of placing<br />\nnumerous facts into a coherent<br />\nframework is valuable because<br />\nthe lawyer must argue in a<br />\nsystematic manner. \"A<br />\nconvincing legal argument will be<br />\n<br />\nclear, understandable, and<br />\nunified,\" stated Kronsberg.<br />\nTherefore courses in all<br />\ndisciplines could conceivably<br />\nprepare a student for legal<br />\nstudies, although political science<br />\nand history are the most popular<br />\n'pre-law'' departments.<br />\nKronsberg recalled that one<br />\nparticular course, \"American<br />\nEconomic History\" was an<br />\nexcellent example of a law school<br />\ncourse. \"The method Dr.<br />\nGalambos used, going from the<br />\nfactual to the theoretical, was<br />\nsimilar to that used by law<br />\nprofessors.\"<br />\nSurprisingly perhaps, the third<br />\nyear Maryland student does not<br />\nbelieve he has any special<br />\nadvantage coming from Hopkins.<br />\n\"Ideally, your undergraduate<br />\neducation is very suitable for law<br />\nif you've been taught how<br />\n_school<br />\n_<br />\nto write clearly and concisely and<br />\nthink rationally. You can come<br />\nacross people who will emphasize<br />\nthese skills at College Park(Univ.<br />\nof Maryland) as well as<br />\nHopkins,\" he contended.<br />\nKronsberg also recommends<br />\nthat pre-law students visit a law<br />\nschool before applying. \"I visited<br />\nHarvard once and fell asleep in<br />\n'Civil Procedure'. Ironically, the<br />\nsame thing happened when I<br />\ntook the course at Maryland,\" he<br />\nmused. Another piece of advice<br />\nwas to take a course in logic<br />\nwhich should serve as good<br />\npreparation for the LSAT.<br />\nKronsberg, a third year<br />\nstudent, is currently searching for<br />\na position in the tight legal<br />\nmarket. \"It's tough to find a<br />\nposition when the economy is<br />\ngood, therefore the recession and<br />\nthe oversupply of law school<br />\ngraduates have substantially<br />\ndecreased traditional legal jobs.<br />\nPeople are going into business,<br />\nadministrative law, and<br />\ngovernment,\" he continued.<br />\n\"Too many undergraduates<br />\nthink that after they graduate<br />\nthey're on the road to a large<br />\nincome and financial security.

A<br />\nprofessor's word does not<br />\nnecessarily weigh more than a<br />\nstudent's.<br />\nNo one involved in a hearing<br />\nof the AEB is allowed legal<br />\ncounsel. The accused's<br />\nrepresentative is required\u2022 to be a<br />\nfull time undergraduate currently<br />\nenrolled in the Division of Arts<br />\nand Sciences. The AEB does not<br />\ninfluence the choice of the<br />\naccused's representative in any<br />\nother way.<br />\nStudents who witness<br />\nossible violations of academic<br />\nintegrity are urged to report<br />\nthem promptly to the professor<br />\nin charge of the course or to the'<br />\nAEB (JHU Box 1280). A<br />\nprofessor who questions a<br />\nstudent's academic integrity is<br />\nstrongly urged to discuss the<br />\nproblem With the student<br />\ninvolved and to attempt to reach<br />\na settlement agreeable to all<br />\nwithout the intervention of the<br />\n<br />\nBoard. If a settlement cannot be<br />\nreached for one reason or<br />\nanother, then it is the desire and<br />\nobligation of the Ethics Board to<br />\nhandle the problem by<br />\nconducting a hearing. The Ethics<br />\nBoard is conscious of the fact<br />\nthat the position of accuser is a<br />\ndifficult and often painful one<br />\nfor the students. As a result,<br />\nstudents who witness possible<br />\nviolations of academic integrity<br />\nthat require a hearing for<br />\nsettlement may request that the<br />\nprofessor in charge act officially<br />\nas the accuser. In this case, the<br />\nstudent shall appear at the<br />\nhearing as a witness. The official<br />\naccuser is present during all<br />\nproceedings.<br />\nThe Ethics Board is<br />\nresponsible for more than formal<br />\nhearings for accused students.<br />\nPresently, the Board is<br />\ninvestigating ways to reduce<br />\nviolations through improved<br />\nexamination procedures or<br />\nmodifications of certain courses.<br />\nThe Board would greatly<br />\nappreciate suggestions from the<br />\nstudents and faculty, and specific<br />\ninformation on courses where<br />\ncheating is a problem.<br />\nThe Academic Ethics Board<br />\nattempts to speak and act<br />\neffectively for those who believe<br />\nthat honor is important on this<br />\ncampus.

CONSIDINE<br />\nRecently, it has come to the<br />\nattention of the American public<br />\nthat wealthy (or even<br />\nnot-so-wealthy) Irish-Americans<br />\nhave been supplying much of the<br />\nmoney the I.R.A. uses to make<br />\nbombs and blow up prominent<br />\nBritish restaurants. This, we are<br />\ntold, is appalling; it should be<br />\nstopped at once.<br />\nGranted, it is not a nice idea to<br />\ngive money to have other people<br />\nblown up. The accusers are hasty<br />\nto add that the American donors<br />\nare \"unwitting\", but they should<br />\nbe prevented from continuing<br />\ntheir charities. And it is usually<br />\npointed out that \"these I.R.A.<br />\npeople make me ashamed to say<br />\nI'm Irish\", and that the whole<br />\naffair is \"really criminal.\"<br />\n<br />\nHow can Americans<br />\ncondemn the imperialism of<br />\nPortugal or the Soviet Union<br />\nwhile ignoring the 'plight<br />\nof the U.K.'s closest<br />\ncolony, Northern Ireland?<br />\nPerhaps I am somewhat jaded,<br />\nor even demented, but for the<br />\nlife of me, I can see very little<br />\ndifference between<br />\nIrish-Americans giving money to<br />\nthe I.R.A. to buy gelgenite, and<br />\nthe World Council of Churches<br />\nunderwriting violent revolutions<br />\nin Africa. Or American Jews<br />\nsending money to buy weapons<br />\nfor Israel, or American Greeks<br />\nsending money to Cyprus, and so<br />\non. The list is endless. But there<br />\nseems to be some sort of<br />\nanathema towards the Irish<br />\nproblem. How can Americans<br />\ncondemn the imperialism of<br />\nPortugal or the Soviet Union,<br />\nwhile ignoring the plight 6f the<br />\nU.K.'s closest colony, Northern<br />\nIreland?<br />\nIt could be that Americans<br />\naren't as well versed in the<br />\nhistory of Ireland as they are in<br />\nsay, the history of Palestine.<br />\nMost Americans, as well as nearly<br />\nall Briton, have the curious idea<br />\nthat Northern Ireland is an<br />\nequanimious part of theUnited<br />\nKingdom. But Ulster is no more a<br />\npart of the U.K. than is Puerto<br />\n<br />\nRico a part of the U.S.<br />\nFurthermore, the ruling<br />\nProtestant class is not ancestrally<br />\nnative to Ulster; they are<br />\nimported Colonists. A quick look<br />\nat seventeenth-century British<br />\nhistory will explain. (What<br />\nfollows is a somewhat superficial<br />\ngloss of the events; restrictions of<br />\nspace do not permit a full<br />\nhistorical discussion. It should<br />\nalso be noted that the perspective<br />\npresented is Irish, not English).<br />\n<br />\nEither everyone is wrong<br />\nor everyone is right...<br />\n<br />\nCatholics in Britain had not<br />\nbeen in a favorable position since<br />\nthe institution of the Church of<br />\nEngland; however, some Kings<br />\nwere less oppressive than others.<br />\nUnder the reign of Charles I, the<br />\nCatholics !lad the advantage of a<br />\nCatholic rule, and consequently<br />\nthe British Government was<br />\nsomewhat right-wing.<br />\nUnfortunately, after civil war<br />\nerupted in 1642, things didn't<br />\nlook so hot for the Catholics.<br />\nThe \"roundheads,\" an alliance of<br />\nradical puritans, headed by Oliver<br />\nCromwell defeated the royalist<br />\n\"cavaliers\". The eventual<br />\noutcome was the decapitation of<br />\nKing Charles (1649), and the<br />\nPuritans took over.<br />\nOne of the principal atrocities<br />\ncarried out by Cromwell was the<br />\nsubjugation of Ireland, a<br />\nlongtime hotbed of Catholic<br />\ndissent (in those days chiefly<br />\nsupported by French or Spanish<br />\nchurchmen). Among Cromwell's<br />\nactions were the slaughter of<br />\nthousands of Irish Catholics \"in<br />\nthe name of God,\" the selling of<br />\nIrish women and children into<br />\nslavery (these were whites in the<br />\nseventeenth century,' mind you),<br />\nand the disenfranchisement of<br />\ntwo-thirds of Ireland.<br />\nOne law which was passed<br />\nforbade any Irishman from<br />\nowning more than one-quarter<br />\nacre of land, or any horse worth<br />\nmore than sixpence. The Irish<br />\nland owners had their land<br />\nconfiscated, and, reduced to<br />\npoverty, were forced to poor<br />\n<br />\nrural western counties, such as<br />\nClare, Mayo, etc. Their land was<br />\ngiven to English nobility, creating<br />\na Colonial Barony for many a<br />\nwealthy Protestant.<br />\nBut in Ulster, this was not<br />\nenough; the potential for<br />\nindustrialization was too great to<br />\nbe ignored. So, in addition to the<br />\nimported British nobility and<br />\nupper class, Scots were brought<br />\nover to fill out the middle class,<br />\nand the native Catholics were<br />\nforced into the position of a<br />\nminority lower class. This was<br />\nover three hundred years ago.<br />\nWhy, then, is it so hard for<br />\nAmericans to realize that the<br />\nIrish problem is not merelY a<br />\nbunch of drunken Irishmen<br />\nshooting at anything which<br />\nmoves; this is a situation easily<br />\nakin to that of the blacks in<br />\nSouth Africa, or the Indians in<br />\nAmerica. The difference is not<br />\none of race, nor is it merely one<br />\nof religion; it is one of<br />\nNationality.<br />\nMaybe the reason Americans<br />\nfind this hard to take is because<br />\nof the glorified image the<br />\nPuritans have held, ever since the<br />\n\"Thanksgiving Day\" story<br />\nbecame a national myth. How<br />\nsoon it is forgotten that in the<br />\n1840's Irishmen were less<br />\ndesirable as workers in America<br />\nthan were blacks.<br />\nGranted, it is not a nice<br />\nidea to give money to<br />\nhave other people blown<br />\nup...<br />\nThe point is that there is as<br />\nmuch justification to giving<br />\nmoney to blow up diners at<br />\nfashionable London clubs as<br />\nthere is to donate funds to pay<br />\nfor the Phantom jets which raid<br />\nPLO bases in Syria.

He is<br />\nWorking on his third bottle of<br />\nCodeine laden cough syrup and,<br />\nalthough he's not hooked yet, I<br />\nhave noticed a faraway, sickly<br />\nlook in his eyes lately. It's not his<br />\nfault (he's a naive soul), but we<br />\nhad warned him of the dangers of<br />\nmessing around in seedy hotel<br />\nlobbies. You just don't know<br />\nWho or what wanders through<br />\nthose d Ira corridors, slithers<br />\nalong those ragged carpets, or<br />\nSleep s on the mustly,<br />\ngertn-covered couches. But Tom<br />\nWouldn't listen, and now he's<br />\nPay in' his dues. Flu-bugs stormed<br />\nInside him before he even had a<br />\nChance to yell for help.<br />\nAnd even if he had screamed,<br />\nWhat then? He would just be one<br />\nmore disease statistic for those<br />\nHealth Education and Welfare<br />\nPeople, one more<br />\ntill- in -the -b lank,<br />\nsign-your-mune-please pawn in<br />\n<br />\nthe worldly game of \"sick\"<br />\npolitics. Tom didn't want to<br />\nmake a big deal of it--he knew<br />\nhe'd gotten it (you always know<br />\nwhen you're getting it)--so he left<br />\nhis fleabag hotel-hangout and<br />\nstruggled home with his tail<br />\nbetween his legs and his flu in his<br />\npocket. And so now he suffers in<br />\nsilence.<br />\nSilence, that is, interrupted by<br />\na piercing, nerve-rattling hack.<br />\nQuiet (God, how we remember<br />\nthose golden days of silence!) is<br />\nshattered by the constant bursts<br />\nof compressed air. No one in my<br />\nhouse has manged to sleep at all<br />\nin the last month--we're thinking<br />\nof starting a walking-zombie club<br />\nsoon. We have tried every<br />\nmethod in the book (plus several<br />\nnot in the book) to calm the sick<br />\none's storm, but every day we<br />\ngrow more and more afraid that<br />\nhe will awaken to find his lungs<br />\nin his lap. We offered<br />\nsubconscious suggestions while<br />\nhe fell into one of his infrequent<br />\n5-minute lulls, but that didn't<br />\n<br />\nwork very well. Tom's<br />\nsubconscious rebelled--it told us<br />\nhe was a schizophrenic, and he<br />\nbegan coughing twice as much as<br />\nbefore. Then we attempted to<br />\nshock him back to health with a<br />\nmonstrous \"Phantom of the<br />\nOpera\" poster, cut from the back<br />\nof a Sugar Smacks box, and<br />\npasted on the inside of his<br />\nglasses. No dice. Finally, we tried<br />\nto nurse him back with a steady<br />\nstream of warm milk, but there<br />\nwas no \"new you\" coming for<br />\nTom. So we sit, waiting.<br />\nTom is waiting too, he coughs,<br />\n\"for his fever to break.\" He<br />\ncomplains that he is living in a<br />\nhouse with four pre-meds and yet<br />\nis without a cure. What is this<br />\nworld (not to mention the<br />\nHippocratic oath) coming to? he<br />\nasks.<br />\nWe all sat cross-legged, around<br />\nhis bed, with our gas masks on,<br />\nchanting witch -doctor<br />\nincantations. Even though the<br />\nchants were inaudible through<br />\nour bulky, yet sanitary masks,<br />\n<br />\nwe tever broke. Suddenly, even<br />\nbefore we could finish our<br />\ntreatment, chills hit him. And<br />\nthen he doubled over, contorted<br />\nby coughs. We chuckled<br />\nnervously, muttered something<br />\nabout how we were only joshing,<br />\nand weasled our way out of the<br />\nward. We then realized that there<br />\nwas only one avenue open to us.<br />\nScience.<br />\nWe got him the best. Anacin,<br />\nContac, Romilar, and even Vick's<br />\nVap-O-Rub. We started him on a<br />\nLinus Pauling diet--ingesting bags<br />\nof Vitamin C every day. But they<br />\nhaven't helped. Like the daily<br />\ntides, his fever peaks in the<br />\nmorning and his chills ebb at<br />\nnight. Waves of coughs flow forth<br />\nfrom his watery innards and even<br />\nhis trusted cough syrup is as<br />\neffective as a drop in the ocean.<br />\nWe don't know what to do (we<br />\nonly give him the syrup to keep<br />\nhim happy)--we're not sure<br />\nthere's anything left to do.<br />\nWe keep pampering him in the<br />\nhope that we can make his last<br />\n<br />\ndays with us as enjoyable as<br />\npossible, yet we know we're<br />\nfighting a losing battle.<br />\nEven Toni is starting to give up<br />\nthe ship. Because of his fever, he<br />\nhas begun hallucinating now too.<br />\nLast night he saw some<br />\ncockroaches putting TV-dinners<br />\nin the oven; the night before, he<br />\nhad a violent argument with a<br />\nMr. Barry Lyndon and ended up<br />\ndueling the night away. He plays<br />\nhis \"Marlene Dietrich Live\"<br />\nalbum over and over again, but<br />\neven Marlene's sultry tones<br />\nhaven't kept his face from losing<br />\nits color or the spark from his<br />\neyes.<br />\nHe's about ready to chuck it<br />\nall now; in fact he's been<br />\nthrowing his Vitamin C tablets at<br />\nimaginary beasts he's \"seen\" in<br />\nhis room\u2014cursing and yelling, in<br />\nhis best James Cagney voice,<br />\n\"You dirty rats! You can't desert<br />\na sinking ship!\"<br />\nWhen Linus Pauling and<br />\nMarlene Dietrich can't help you,<br />\nyou know you're hurtin'.<br />\n<br />\nFebruary 23, 1976<br />\nDr. Steven Muller,<br />\nPresident<br />\nThe Johns Hopkins University<br />\nBaltimore, Maryland 21218<br />\nDear President Muller,<br />\nThe following is to express our grave disappointment and<br />\nshock at the recent awarding of an honorary doctorate to Princess<br />\nAshraf Pahlavi' of the dictatorship of Iran. Did it never occur<br />\nto those responsible for this regrettable choice that the<br />\nwidespread political torture exercised by the Iranian secret<br />\nPolice, both in Iran and abroad, is a matter of international<br />\nscandal? Amnesty International has stated, in a report written<br />\nMay 16, 1975, that \"no country in the world has a worse record<br />\nin human rights than Iran.\" More locally, there is ample evidence<br />\nthat the secret police, present at the Hopkins centennial periodically harasses dissident Iranian students in this country.<br />\nIf Hopkins is unable to remedy this last matter, it should certainly<br />\nnot pretend, through its celebrations, that it does not exist.<br />\nMoreover, we take the view that the \"sale\" of honorary degrees<br />\nin return for donations or other favors is no less reprehensible<br />\nthan the sale of ambassadorships in return for political contributions. In this case there is surely the gravest suspicion of<br />\nsome arrangement between Hopkins and the regime of the Shah. If<br />\nthis be the case, then we would like to know the terms of such<br />\nan arrangement and to be assured that it is indeed in the interests<br />\nOf the entire people of Iran rather than simply serving to legitimize<br />\nand bolster the power of a repressive and reprehensible government.<br />\n. Finally, we regret that a hundred years of Hopkins should culminate in so demagogical an appeal to feminist values as appears<br />\nin the third paragraph accompanying the conferral of the degree.<br />\nThat Princess Ashraf Pahlavi should be acti le in mobilizing \"the<br />\nAffluent women of her country, that she should do so out of a<br />\nbelief that only when women achieve their full potential in<br />\nhuman society, etc.,\" does not in any way mitigate her role as a<br />\nleading member of a repressive police state. We also would like<br />\nto call your attention to persistent reports of the involvement<br />\nOf members of the family of the Shah in drug trafficking, and that<br />\nPrincess Ashraf was herself arrested by the Swiss police in 1960<br />\nfor illegal possession of heroin.<br />\nWe urge, therefore, that the University clarify its position<br />\nin this matter and also that it drop all charges against the protesters at the Centennial.<br />\n<br />\nThis letter, which has already been sent to President Muller,<br />\nwas signed by approximately 35 Hopkins faculty 'members.<br />\n<br />\nMethanol-the fuel of tomorrowl<br />\nBy ALFRED DANIELS<br />\nAn oil slick in academic<br />\nintegrity??<br />\nIf you gulped the last time you<br />\ngassed up, you can expect no<br />\nimmediate relief from this<br />\ncountry's oil industry.

MIT, conversely,<br />\nhas a similar stake in the oil/auto<br />\nfolks: of $208.6 million<br />\nindustrial stocks and bonds, they<br />\nhave $80.1 million in auto and<br />\noil holdings.

Bowie,<br />\nVice-President for, Business<br />\nManagement, termed the chances<br />\nfor a balanced budget next year<br />\ngood. \"Compared with what We<br />\nwere looking at in December,<br />\nyes, the situation looks much<br />\nbetter,\" he commented.<br />\nBowie pointed out, however,<br />\nthat fiscal conditions next year<br />\ncould vary considerable from<br />\nwhat is currently projected.<br />\nSpecifically, he cited the recent<br />\npostage increase and deregulation<br />\nof natural gas as items which<br />\ncould be costly next year.<br />\nUnexpected factors could also<br />\nsave money, Bowie stated. \"This<br />\nyear, nothing has helped us more<br />\nthan a warm month of<br />\nFebruary,\" he noted.<br />\n\"I don't see the situation<br />\ngetting any better for the next<br />\nthree or four years,\" he stated.<br />\n\"It's going to be tight. Some<br />\neconomists have predicted<br />\nanother recession worse than the<br />\none we had last year, and<br />\nhand-in-hand with recession<br />\ncomes inflation.\"<br />\nBowie thinks a balanced<br />\nbudget helps gain access to more<br />\nmoney. \"Personally, I think that<br />\ndonors would rather put their<br />\nmoney into a balanced budget<br />\nthan one which is in the red,\" he<br />\nstated.<br />\nOne foctor which has not<br />\ngreatly affected the fiscal<br />\nsituation at Hopkins, Bowie said,<br />\nis the rise in value of stocks on<br />\nthe exchange. Even though the<br />\nvalue of the University's<br /><br />\nendowment has increased,<br />\ndividends paid out to the<br />\nUniversity have remained<br />\nconstant.<br /><br />\ndrives have raised approximately<br />\n$65,000 a year, not nearly what<br />\nthe conservatory needs to<br />\nsurvive.<br />\nFrom a high of S6 million in<br />\n1972, the endowment has<br />\ndropped to a current low of S3.5<br />\nmillion. Reduction of<br />\nendowment capital results in a<br />\nfall in income, creating a<br />\ndownward spiral of liquid assets.<br />\nThe future status of the<br />\nendowment is in serious doubt<br />\nbecause scholarships are pulled<br />\nfrom the fund, which will result<br />\nin either depletion of the<br />\nendowment or the reduction in<br />\nscholarship aid, either of which<br />\nwould likely destroy<br />\nPeabody. Established by<br />\nGeorge Peabody in the 1850's<br />\nand 1860's with a $1.4 million<br />\ngrant, because of a dearth of<br />\ncultural activities, the Peabody<br />\noriginally encompassed a number<br />\nof areas: a research and reference<br />\nlibrary; an art collection; a<br />\nlecture series in the fields of art,<br />\nscience, and education; and an<br />\nacademy of music. Only the<br />\nConservatory remains.<br />\nWhile the Institute was being<br />\nformulated, George Peabody met<br />\nwith Johns Hopkins who was<br />\nconsidering the creation of a<br /><br />\nphilanthropic foundation at the<br />\ntime. Within twenty-four hours<br />\nof that meeting, Johns Hopkins<br />\nmade out his will establishing the<br />\nUniversity and Medical School<br />\nwhich bear his name.<br />\nUpon the death of Hopkins,<br />\nDaniel Coit Gilman left his<br />\neducational post at Berkely to<br />\naccept this University's<br />\npresidency. The existence of the<br />\nPeabody Library in Baltimore<br />\nwas a major factor in Gilman's<br />\ndecision; in -fact, selection of the<br />\nUniversity's original site was<br />\nbased, in part, upon easy access<br />\nto the library.<br />\nIn view of the past relationship<br />\nbetween these two institutions,<br />\nWoolf pointed out \"the<br />\nappropriateness of celebrating<br />\nour centennial by establishing an<br />\naffiliation with the Peabody.\"<br />\nA meeting will occur next<br />\nweek between the committees<br />\nappointed by the involved<br />\nparties.

The Instant Lottery has<br />\nfolks from Salisbury to<br />\nGaithesburg madly scraping away<br />\ntheir Sunday mornings, lunch<br />\nbreaks, and midnight beer<br />\npick-ups. Why the sensation?<br />\nThe old lottery made its share<br />\nof money (and still does), but<br />\ninstantaneous attraction was<br />\nlacking. One would sit around for<br />\na week, possibly losing the ticket<br />\nor forgetting to check the<br />\npaper\u2014no immediate interest. A<br />\nweekly drawing was held on<br />\ntelevision to lure all the<br />\ngame-show fanatics, but that<br />\nseemed an endless procession of<br />\nold ladies with shopping bags,<br />\nbabbling about their $1000 prize.<br />\nBetter the numbers or the horses,<br />\nthan this stultifying scheme.<br />\nThen, however, some genius<br />\nemerged from the labyrinthine<br />\nrecesses of the state bureaucracy,<br />\nand cried, \"I have it! Instant<br />\nlottery! Instant redemption!<br />\nCatholic appeal!\" The wheels<br />\nbegan to turn, the presses rolled,<br />\nand three weeks ago The Day<br />\narrived. The New Maryland<br />\nInstant Lottery had been<br />\nunleashed.<br />\nMy gambling acquaintance, the<br />\nMan from New York, still had<br />\nabout $200 left from a big exacta<br />\nwin at Bowie, so he decided to<br />\nventure into this new, legal<br />\nwagering system. It promised the<br />\nbest odds in the country\u2014better<br /><br />\nthan one winner in ten, and only<br />\n$1 a try\u2014and possessed people<br />\nby its wonderful simplicity:<br />\nmerely match three cash amounts<br />\nout of six boxes. Sixty dollars of<br />\ntickets bought at 8 a.m. at the<br />\ndrug store returned twenty, and<br />\nthat amount was continually<br />\nreinvested until it diminished to<br />\nthe zero point. The Man from<br />\nNew York's strategy (as<br />\nexplicated by Kenny the Horse),<br />\n'although an initial failure, was<br />\nsound in fortune: keep playing<br />\nuntil one hits a big prize, and<br />\nthen pull out.<br />\n\u2022<br />\nBig Wins<br />\nThe really extraordinary<br />\npay-offs are $10,000 and $1000,<br />\nbut one shouldn't sit in the Blue<br />\nJay scraping away in eager<br />\nanticipation. After a consistent<br />\namount of playing, a fifty or<br />\nhundred dollar prize will appear,<br />\nand then one retires to a<br />\nweekend of leisure. The two and<br />\nfive dollar winners should be<br />\ntraded in on the spot for more<br />\ntickets; the more cautious may<br />\nrecoup their original investment<br />\nand work from there.<br />\nThe veteran lottery-player will<br />\nlearn the nuances of the game, be<br />\nable to spot a likely winner after<br />\nrubbing out only a few boxes.<br />\nNovices often ask: should you<br />\nsell a four-box two-way split for<br />\nifty cents, scrape out the lower<br />\nieft-hand corner before or after<br />\nthe upper right-hand corner, and<br />\nsuchlike pertinent questions.<br />\nKnowledge, verily, comes only<br /><br />\nwith experience (and money).<br />\nTake a seat at the bar, pull out a<br />\nroll of dusty bills (buy a few<br />\ndrinks to keep the bartender on<br />\nyour good side), and get into it.<br />\nA hint for the beginner: the<br />\nlower right-hand corner box, if a<br />\ntwo or a five, is very likely a<br />\nwinner! By all means, scrape that<br />\none first. Spelling<br />\nThe inventor of this<br />\nmagnificent game did not stop at<br />\ncreating a bait for quick winners.<br />\nMimesis, he knew and did not<br />\nfear. Let the losers in life get up<br />\noff the canvas and come battling<br />\nback for another shot. Thus the<br />\nlower portion of the ticket, the<br />\nstub, conceals a letter\u2014if one<br />\nspells \"MARYLAND\" or<br />\n\"INSTANT\", $1000 or $100 is<br />\nwon. By now, of course, key<br />\nletters have been identified: an R<br />\nor S will reap ample reward. The<br />\ncommon letters spell out a<br />\nvariety of words (the deviser was<br />\ncareful to prevent any possible<br />\nobscenities) of interest:<br />\n\"MANDAL\"(sorry, no E)would<br />\npresumably get you an<br />\nindictment.<br />\nThe lottery craze threatens to<br />\nturn the Friday paycheck lines<br />\ninto ticket-distribution centers.<br />\nThe mania can strike any<br />\ninnocent wage-earner. As an<br />\nultimate goal, the Grand Prize<br />\nDrawing yields $500 a week for<br />\nlife; the lucky winner obtains the<br />\ndistinct pleasure of being able to<br />\nbuy five hundred tickets a week.<br /><br />\n\u2022?.<br /><br />\nIlany Woolf<br /><br />\nJump from undergrad<br />\nto law school is big<br />\nBy JAN HAMMERMAN<br />\n\"One of the biggest<br />\nadjustments in going from an<br />\nundergraduate institution to law<br />\nschool is that the intellectual<br />\nenvironment of the former<br />\nemphasizes answers while the<br />\nlatter poses questions,\" asserts<br />\nAbe Kronsberg, a law student at<br />\nthe University of Maryland.<br />\nKronsberg, a Hopkins<br />\nalumnus, contends that there is<br />\nmore interplay between the pupil<br />\nand professor in law school due<br />\nto the Socratic method of<br />\nteaching. This system uses a<br />\nseries of questions from the<br />\nteacher directed to individual<br />\nstudents as a means of<br />\nreinforcing legal principles.<br />\n\"Whereas the scholar is<br />\nsupporting a certain thesis which<br />\nhe has presumably spent years<br />\ndeveloping, the lawyer's task is to<br />\nadvocate a certain position<br />\nrelating to a unique set of<br />\ncircumstances,\" said Kronsberg.<br />\nExams<br />\nThis difference in teaching<br />\nstyle is reflected in law<br />\nex aminations. \"In law school<br />\nthere are more 'open question'<br />\ntests which demand a set of<br />\nanswers rather than one reply,\"<br />\nhe offered. Also, in law courses<br />\none final test, usually three hours<br />\nlong, is the sole . criterion of<br />\ngrades. Professors mark the final<br />\non a 'blind system'--that is,<br />\nwithout knowledge of whom has<br />\ntaken which exam.<br />\nKronsberg regards the ability<br />\nto \"read large amounts of<br />\nmaterial, glean from that material<br />\nkey principles, and then put<br />\nthose concepts into a system\" as<br />\nthe most important skill in law<br />\nschool. \"One must be able to<br />\nread 1000 pages of texts and boil<br />\nit down to a twenty page<br />\noutline-but one which covers the<br />\nentire scope of the subject,\" he<br />\nexplained.<br />\nKnowledge of placing<br />\nnumerous facts into a coherent<br />\nframework is valuable because<br />\nthe lawyer must argue in a<br />\nsystematic manner. \"A<br />\nconvincing legal argument will be<br /><br />\nclear, understandable, and<br />\nunified,\" stated Kronsberg.<br />\nTherefore courses in all<br />\ndisciplines could conceivably<br />\nprepare a student for legal<br />\nstudies, although political science<br />\nand history are the most popular<br />\n'pre-law'' departments.<br />\nKronsberg recalled that one<br />\nparticular course, \"American<br />\nEconomic History\" was an<br />\nexcellent example of a law school<br />\ncourse. \"The method Dr.<br />\nGalambos used, going from the<br />\nfactual to the theoretical, was<br />\nsimilar to that used by law<br />\nprofessors.\"<br />\nSurprisingly perhaps, the third<br />\nyear Maryland student does not<br />\nbelieve he has any special<br />\nadvantage coming from Hopkins.<br />\n\"Ideally, your undergraduate<br />\neducation is very suitable for law<br />\nif you've been taught how<br />\n_school<br />\n_<br />\nto write clearly and concisely and<br />\nthink rationally. You can come<br />\nacross people who will emphasize<br />\nthese skills at College Park(Univ.<br />\nof Maryland) as well as<br />\nHopkins,\" he contended.<br />\nKronsberg also recommends<br />\nthat pre-law students visit a law<br />\nschool before applying. \"I visited<br />\nHarvard once and fell asleep in<br />\n'Civil Procedure'. Ironically, the<br />\nsame thing happened when I<br />\ntook the course at Maryland,\" he<br />\nmused. Another piece of advice<br />\nwas to take a course in logic<br />\nwhich should serve as good<br />\npreparation for the LSAT.<br />\nKronsberg, a third year<br />\nstudent, is currently searching for<br />\na position in the tight legal<br />\nmarket. \"It's tough to find a<br />\nposition when the economy is<br />\ngood, therefore the recession and<br />\nthe oversupply of law school<br />\ngraduates have substantially<br />\ndecreased traditional legal jobs.<br />\nPeople are going into business,<br />\nadministrative law, and<br />\ngovernment,\" he continued.<br />\n\"Too many undergraduates<br />\nthink that after they graduate<br />\nthey're on the road to a large<br />\nincome and financial security.

The accused's<br />\nrepresentative is required\u2022 to be a<br />\nfull time undergraduate currently<br />\nenrolled in the Division of Arts<br />\nand Sciences. The AEB does not<br />\ninfluence the choice of the<br />\naccused's representative in any<br />\nother way.<br />\nStudents who witness<br />\nossible violations of academic<br />\nintegrity are urged to report<br />\nthem promptly to the professor<br />\nin charge of the course or to the'<br />\nAEB (JHU Box 1280). A<br />\nprofessor who questions a<br />\nstudent's academic integrity is<br />\nstrongly urged to discuss the<br />\nproblem With the student<br />\ninvolved and to attempt to reach<br />\na settlement agreeable to all<br />\nwithout the intervention of the<br /><br />\nBoard. If a settlement cannot be<br />\nreached for one reason or<br />\nanother, then it is the desire and<br />\nobligation of the Ethics Board to<br />\nhandle the problem by<br />\nconducting a hearing. The Ethics<br />\nBoard is conscious of the fact<br />\nthat the position of accuser is a<br />\ndifficult and often painful one<br />\nfor the students. As a result,<br />\nstudents who witness possible<br />\nviolations of academic integrity<br />\nthat require a hearing for<br />\nsettlement may request that the<br />\nprofessor in charge act officially<br />\nas the accuser. In this case, the<br />\nstudent shall appear at the<br />\nhearing as a witness. The official<br />\naccuser is present during all<br />\nproceedings.<br />\nThe Ethics Board is<br />\nresponsible for more than formal<br />\nhearings for accused students.<br />\nPresently, the Board is<br />\ninvestigating ways to reduce<br />\nviolations through improved<br />\nexamination procedures or<br />\nmodifications of certain courses.<br />\nThe Board would greatly<br />\nappreciate suggestions from the<br />\nstudents and faculty, and specific<br />\ninformation on courses where<br />\ncheating is a problem.<br />\nThe Academic Ethics Board<br />\nattempts to speak and act<br />\neffectively for those who believe<br />\nthat honor is important on this<br />\ncampus.

CONSIDINE<br />\nRecently, it has come to the<br />\nattention of the American public<br />\nthat wealthy (or even<br />\nnot-so-wealthy) Irish-Americans<br />\nhave been supplying much of the<br />\nmoney the I.R.A. uses to make<br />\nbombs and blow up prominent<br />\nBritish restaurants. This, we are<br />\ntold, is appalling; it should be<br />\nstopped at once.<br />\nGranted, it is not a nice idea to<br />\ngive money to have other people<br />\nblown up. The accusers are hasty<br />\nto add that the American donors<br />\nare \"unwitting\", but they should<br />\nbe prevented from continuing<br />\ntheir charities. And it is usually<br />\npointed out that \"these I.R.A.<br />\npeople make me ashamed to say<br />\nI'm Irish\", and that the whole<br />\naffair is \"really criminal.\"<br /><br />\nHow can Americans<br />\ncondemn the imperialism of<br />\nPortugal or the Soviet Union<br />\nwhile ignoring the 'plight<br />\nof the U.K.'s closest<br />\ncolony, Northern Ireland?<br />\nPerhaps I am somewhat jaded,<br />\nor even demented, but for the<br />\nlife of me, I can see very little<br />\ndifference between<br />\nIrish-Americans giving money to<br />\nthe I.R.A. to buy gelgenite, and<br />\nthe World Council of Churches<br />\nunderwriting violent revolutions<br />\nin Africa. Or American Jews<br />\nsending money to buy weapons<br />\nfor Israel, or American Greeks<br />\nsending money to Cyprus, and so<br />\non. The list is endless. But there<br />\nseems to be some sort of<br />\nanathema towards the Irish<br />\nproblem. How can Americans<br />\ncondemn the imperialism of<br />\nPortugal or the Soviet Union,<br />\nwhile ignoring the plight 6f the<br />\nU.K.'s closest colony, Northern<br />\nIreland?<br />\nIt could be that Americans<br />\naren't as well versed in the<br />\nhistory of Ireland as they are in<br />\nsay, the history of Palestine.<br />\nMost Americans, as well as nearly<br />\nall Briton, have the curious idea<br />\nthat Northern Ireland is an<br />\nequanimious part of theUnited<br />\nKingdom. But Ulster is no more a<br />\npart of the U.K. than is Puerto<br /><br />\nRico a part of the U.S.<br />\nFurthermore, the ruling<br />\nProtestant class is not ancestrally<br />\nnative to Ulster; they are<br />\nimported Colonists. A quick look<br />\nat seventeenth-century British<br />\nhistory will explain. (What<br />\nfollows is a somewhat superficial<br />\ngloss of the events; restrictions of<br />\nspace do not permit a full<br />\nhistorical discussion. It should<br />\nalso be noted that the perspective<br />\npresented is Irish, not English).<br /><br />\nEither everyone is wrong<br />\nor everyone is right...<br /><br />\nCatholics in Britain had not<br />\nbeen in a favorable position since<br />\nthe institution of the Church of<br />\nEngland; however, some Kings<br />\nwere less oppressive than others.<br />\nUnder the reign of Charles I, the<br />\nCatholics !lad the advantage of a<br />\nCatholic rule, and consequently<br />\nthe British Government was<br />\nsomewhat right-wing.<br />\nUnfortunately, after civil war<br />\nerupted in 1642, things didn't<br />\nlook so hot for the Catholics.<br />\nThe \"roundheads,\" an alliance of<br />\nradical puritans, headed by Oliver<br />\nCromwell defeated the royalist<br />\n\"cavaliers\". The eventual<br />\noutcome was the decapitation of<br />\nKing Charles (1649), and the<br />\nPuritans took over.<br />\nOne of the principal atrocities<br />\ncarried out by Cromwell was the<br />\nsubjugation of Ireland, a<br />\nlongtime hotbed of Catholic<br />\ndissent (in those days chiefly<br />\nsupported by French or Spanish<br />\nchurchmen). Among Cromwell's<br />\nactions were the slaughter of<br />\nthousands of Irish Catholics \"in<br />\nthe name of God,\" the selling of<br />\nIrish women and children into<br />\nslavery (these were whites in the<br />\nseventeenth century,' mind you),<br />\nand the disenfranchisement of<br />\ntwo-thirds of Ireland.<br />\nOne law which was passed<br />\nforbade any Irishman from<br />\nowning more than one-quarter<br />\nacre of land, or any horse worth<br />\nmore than sixpence. The Irish<br />\nland owners had their land<br />\nconfiscated, and, reduced to<br />\npoverty, were forced to poor<br /><br />\nrural western counties, such as<br />\nClare, Mayo, etc. Their land was<br />\ngiven to English nobility, creating<br />\na Colonial Barony for many a<br />\nwealthy Protestant.<br />\nBut in Ulster, this was not<br />\nenough; the potential for<br />\nindustrialization was too great to<br />\nbe ignored. So, in addition to the<br />\nimported British nobility and<br />\nupper class, Scots were brought<br />\nover to fill out the middle class,<br />\nand the native Catholics were<br />\nforced into the position of a<br />\nminority lower class. This was<br />\nover three hundred years ago.<br />\nWhy, then, is it so hard for<br />\nAmericans to realize that the<br />\nIrish problem is not merelY a<br />\nbunch of drunken Irishmen<br />\nshooting at anything which<br />\nmoves; this is a situation easily<br />\nakin to that of the blacks in<br />\nSouth Africa, or the Indians in<br />\nAmerica. The difference is not<br />\none of race, nor is it merely one<br />\nof religion; it is one of<br />\nNationality.<br />\nMaybe the reason Americans<br />\nfind this hard to take is because<br />\nof the glorified image the<br />\nPuritans have held, ever since the<br />\n\"Thanksgiving Day\" story<br />\nbecame a national myth. How<br />\nsoon it is forgotten that in the<br />\n1840's Irishmen were less<br />\ndesirable as workers in America<br />\nthan were blacks.<br />\nGranted, it is not a nice<br />\nidea to give money to<br />\nhave other people blown<br />\nup...<br />\nThe point is that there is as<br />\nmuch justification to giving<br />\nmoney to blow up diners at<br />\nfashionable London clubs as<br />\nthere is to donate funds to pay<br />\nfor the Phantom jets which raid<br />\nPLO bases in Syria. Either<br />\neveryone is wrong, or everyone is<br />\nright. A buck for a bomb is the<br />\nsame, regardless of the hand that<br />\nthrows the bomb or gives the<br />\nbuck.

He is<br />\nWorking on his third bottle of<br />\nCodeine laden cough syrup and,<br />\nalthough he's not hooked yet, I<br />\nhave noticed a faraway, sickly<br />\nlook in his eyes lately. It's not his<br />\nfault (he's a naive soul), but we<br />\nhad warned him of the dangers of<br />\nmessing around in seedy hotel<br />\nlobbies. You just don't know<br />\nWho or what wanders through<br />\nthose d Ira corridors, slithers<br />\nalong those ragged carpets, or<br />\nSleep s on the mustly,<br />\ngertn-covered couches. But Tom<br />\nWouldn't listen, and now he's<br />\nPay in' his dues. Flu-bugs stormed<br />\nInside him before he even had a<br />\nChance to yell for help.<br />\nAnd even if he had screamed,<br />\nWhat then? He would just be one<br />\nmore disease statistic for those<br />\nHealth Education and Welfare<br />\nPeople, one more<br />\ntill- in -the -b lank,<br />\nsign-your-mune-please pawn in<br /><br />\nthe worldly game of \"sick\"<br />\npolitics. Tom didn't want to<br />\nmake a big deal of it--he knew<br />\nhe'd gotten it (you always know<br />\nwhen you're getting it)--so he left<br />\nhis fleabag hotel-hangout and<br />\nstruggled home with his tail<br />\nbetween his legs and his flu in his<br />\npocket. And so now he suffers in<br />\nsilence.<br />\nSilence, that is, interrupted by<br />\na piercing, nerve-rattling hack.<br />\nQuiet (God, how we remember<br />\nthose golden days of silence!) is<br />\nshattered by the constant bursts<br />\nof compressed air. No one in my<br />\nhouse has manged to sleep at all<br />\nin the last month--we're thinking<br />\nof starting a walking-zombie club<br />\nsoon. We have tried every<br />\nmethod in the book (plus several<br />\nnot in the book) to calm the sick<br />\none's storm, but every day we<br />\ngrow more and more afraid that<br />\nhe will awaken to find his lungs<br />\nin his lap. We offered<br />\nsubconscious suggestions while<br />\nhe fell into one of his infrequent<br />\n5-minute lulls, but that didn't<br /><br />\nwork very well. Tom's<br />\nsubconscious rebelled--it told us<br />\nhe was a schizophrenic, and he<br />\nbegan coughing twice as much as<br />\nbefore. Then we attempted to<br />\nshock him back to health with a<br />\nmonstrous \"Phantom of the<br />\nOpera\" poster, cut from the back<br />\nof a Sugar Smacks box, and<br />\npasted on the inside of his<br />\nglasses. No dice. Finally, we tried<br />\nto nurse him back with a steady<br />\nstream of warm milk, but there<br />\nwas no \"new you\" coming for<br />\nTom. So we sit, waiting.<br />\nTom is waiting too, he coughs,<br />\n\"for his fever to break.\" He<br />\ncomplains that he is living in a<br />\nhouse with four pre-meds and yet<br />\nis without a cure. What is this<br />\nworld (not to mention the<br />\nHippocratic oath) coming to? he<br />\nasks.<br />\nWe all sat cross-legged, around<br />\nhis bed, with our gas masks on,<br />\nchanting witch -doctor<br />\nincantations. Even though the<br />\nchants were inaudible through<br />\nour bulky, yet sanitary masks,<br /><br />\nwe tever broke. Suddenly, even<br />\nbefore we could finish our<br />\ntreatment, chills hit him. And<br />\nthen he doubled over, contorted<br />\nby coughs. We chuckled<br />\nnervously, muttered something<br />\nabout how we were only joshing,<br />\nand weasled our way out of the<br />\nward. We then realized that there<br />\nwas only one avenue open to us.<br />\nScience.<br />\nWe got him the best. Anacin,<br />\nContac, Romilar, and even Vick's<br />\nVap-O-Rub. We started him on a<br />\nLinus Pauling diet--ingesting bags<br />\nof Vitamin C every day. But they<br />\nhaven't helped. Like the daily<br />\ntides, his fever peaks in the<br />\nmorning and his chills ebb at<br />\nnight. Waves of coughs flow forth<br />\nfrom his watery innards and even<br />\nhis trusted cough syrup is as<br />\neffective as a drop in the ocean.<br />\nWe don't know what to do (we<br />\nonly give him the syrup to keep<br />\nhim happy)--we're not sure<br />\nthere's anything left to do.<br />\nWe keep pampering him in the<br />\nhope that we can make his last<br /><br />\ndays with us as enjoyable as<br />\npossible, yet we know we're<br />\nfighting a losing battle.<br />\nEven Toni is starting to give up<br />\nthe ship. Because of his fever, he<br />\nhas begun hallucinating now too.<br />\nLast night he saw some<br />\ncockroaches putting TV-dinners<br />\nin the oven; the night before, he<br />\nhad a violent argument with a<br />\nMr. Barry Lyndon and ended up<br />\ndueling the night away. He plays<br />\nhis \"Marlene Dietrich Live\"<br />\nalbum over and over again, but<br />\neven Marlene's sultry tones<br />\nhaven't kept his face from losing<br />\nits color or the spark from his<br />\neyes.<br />\nHe's about ready to chuck it<br />\nall now; in fact he's been<br />\nthrowing his Vitamin C tablets at<br />\nimaginary beasts he's \"seen\" in<br />\nhis room\u2014cursing and yelling, in<br />\nhis best James Cagney voice,<br />\n\"You dirty rats! You can't desert<br />\na sinking ship!\"<br />\nWhen Linus Pauling and<br />\nMarlene Dietrich can't help you,<br />\nyou know you're hurtin'.<br /><br />\nFebruary 23, 1976<br />\nDr. Steven Muller,<br />\nPresident<br />\nThe Johns Hopkins University<br />\nBaltimore, Maryland 21218<br />\nDear President Muller,<br />\nThe following is to express our grave disappointment and<br />\nshock at the recent awarding of an honorary doctorate to Princess<br />\nAshraf Pahlavi' of the dictatorship of Iran. Did it never occur<br />\nto those responsible for this regrettable choice that the<br />\nwidespread political torture exercised by the Iranian secret<br />\nPolice, both in Iran and abroad, is a matter of international<br />\nscandal? Amnesty International has stated, in a report written<br />\nMay 16, 1975, that \"no country in the world has a worse record<br />\nin human rights than Iran.\" More locally, there is ample evidence<br />\nthat the secret police, present at the Hopkins centennial periodically harasses dissident Iranian students in this country.<br />\nIf Hopkins is unable to remedy this last matter, it should certainly<br />\nnot pretend, through its celebrations, that it does not exist.<br />\nMoreover, we take the view that the \"sale\" of honorary degrees<br />\nin return for donations or other favors is no less reprehensible<br />\nthan the sale of ambassadorships in return for political contributions. In this case there is surely the gravest suspicion of<br />\nsome arrangement between Hopkins and the regime of the Shah. If<br />\nthis be the case, then we would like to know the terms of such<br />\nan arrangement and to be assured that it is indeed in the interests<br />\nOf the entire people of Iran rather than simply serving to legitimize<br />\nand bolster the power of a repressive and reprehensible government.<br />\n. Finally, we regret that a hundred years of Hopkins should culminate in so demagogical an appeal to feminist values as appears<br />\nin the third paragraph accompanying the conferral of the degree.<br />\nThat Princess Ashraf Pahlavi should be acti le in mobilizing \"the<br />\nAffluent women of her country, that she should do so out of a<br />\nbelief that only when women achieve their full potential in<br />\nhuman society, etc.,\" does not in any way mitigate her role as a<br />\nleading member of a repressive police state. We also would like<br />\nto call your attention to persistent reports of the involvement<br />\nOf members of the family of the Shah in drug trafficking, and that<br />\nPrincess Ashraf was herself arrested by the Swiss police in 1960<br />\nfor illegal possession of heroin.<br />\nWe urge, therefore, that the University clarify its position<br />\nin this matter and also that it drop all charges against the protesters at the Centennial.<br /><br />\nThis letter, which has already been sent to President Muller,<br />\nwas signed by approximately 35 Hopkins faculty 'members.<br /><br />\nMethanol-the fuel of tomorrowl<br />\nBy ALFRED DANIELS<br />\nAn oil slick in academic<br />\nintegrity??<br />\nIf you gulped the last time you<br />\ngassed up, you can expect no<br />\nimmediate relief from this<br />\ncountry's oil industry.
