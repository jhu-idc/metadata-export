His voice was loud, his style<br />\nwas rugged; but his theme struck<br />\na sympathetic chord in the hearts<br />\nof the audience; and he was interrupted by successive bursts of applause as he proclaimed that the<br />\nhope of peace could be achieved<br />\nonly by instillincr peaceful sentimenth into the minds of the rising<br />\ngeneration.<br />\nMr. T-Towe was succeeded by a<br />\nspeaker who was his antithesis in<br />\nevery respect, Mr. Lawrence W.<br />\nBridge, of Hiram College, Ohio,<br />\nwhose mellow voice and glib erudition were expressed on tracing the<br />\n\"Evolution of World Peace.\"<br />\nAfter the first four orators had<br />\ndone, there followed an intermission. during which Mr. Uhlig refreshed the audience with two solos.<br />\n<br />\nThe regular annual meeting for<br />\nthe election of officers and members of the Alpha Chapter of the<br />\nhonorary fraternity, Phi Beta<br />\nKappa, was held in the Donovan<br />\nRoom, McCoy Hall, on Wednesday, May 3, at 4 o'clock. The following officers for the ensuing year<br />\nwere elected: President, Dr. L.<br />\nF. Barker; vice-president, Dr. W.<br />\nB. Clark; secretary, Dr. L. M.<br />\nRaney; treasurer, Dr. L. S.

Holland,<br />\nDr. H. A. Kelly, and Dr. L. A.<br />\nTerracher.<br />\nThe banquet which always follows the election was held Saturday evening, at 7 o'clock, in the<br />\nDonovan Room. The speaker of<br />\nthe evening was Mr. Paul Shorey.<br />\nThere was an unusually small<br />\nnumber of undergraduates elected<br />\nthis year. Only two of the four<br />\nmen who received the honor were<br />\nseniors. The other two were<br />\njuniors, Mr. Wolman and Mr.<br />\nKuehn both being members of the<br />\n1912 class who have gone through<br />\nthe University in three years. To<br />\nbe thus elected is particularly an<br />\nhonor. Several seniors, unfortunately, fell just shortof the requisite<br />\naverage for admission.<br />\nThese<br />\nmen, however, can console themselves with the thought that Hopkins is the *hardest University in<br />\nthe country to enter the Phi Beta<br />\nKappa through.<br />\n<br />\n. The University \u2022 lacrosse team<br />\nagain on Saturday afternoon, at<br />\nHomewood, showed its unquestioned mastery of the Indian game, and<br />\nability to play against heavy odds,<br />\nwhen they won from Lehigh by a<br />\nscore of 6 to.4. This-simple statement, however, does not tell the<br />\n,story of the game, as it was one of<br />\nthe hardest contests ever seen in<br />\nBaltimore, and for a time it looked<br />\nas .if the Varsity was going to suffer its first defeat of the season.<br />\nIt was only after Hopkins had<br />\nmade a splendid rally in the -first<br />\nhalf, scoring -three goals in less<br />\nthan that number of minutes, thus<br />\ntying the score; and after the<br />\ncoaches made material changes in<br />\nthe system of play and lineup, infusing new blood into the game as<br />\nthe. second session progressed, that<br />\nthe victory was 'really certain, and<br />\nthen in the last few Minutes of the<br />\nsecond stanza, Lehigh made a'good<br />\nspurt and, for a time was very<br />\ndangerous.<br />\nThe South I3ethlehemites showed<br />\nunexpected strength and made more<br />\nattempts at our goal than did the<br />\nVarsity at theirs.. The successful<br />\nresult can undoubtedly be attributed<br />\nto Sutton, who was a veritable<br />\nwonder between the posts, stopping<br />\nno less than twenty-five shots, many<br />\nof which 'were very 'difficult ones.<br />\nOf course so far as winning the<br />\ncontest goes, we put the praise on<br />\nthe shoulders of one of the best<br />\nattack men the game had ever produced, and take our hats off to him<br />\nnow, as we. did after the Swarthmore contest, for his two goals on<br />\nSaturday enabled Hopkins to win.<br />\n<br />\nOn Saturday afternoon, the Hopkins Track and Field Team met the<br />\nteam of the Naval Academy at Annapolis.<br />\nHorrax and Lee were the stars<br />\nof the contest. Horrax contributed<br />\ntwenty points to Hopkins' score by<br />\nwinning, the 120-yards hurdles, the<br />\nbroad jump, the high jump; and the<br />\npole vault; His time in the hurdles<br />\nwas only two-fifths of a .\u00a7econd<br />\nbehind the inter-collegiate record,<br />\nand almost a second better than the<br />\nNavy record. Lee won both the<br />\nmile and the two Mile runs in record time, breaking the I-Iokpins and<br />\nthe Navy marks in the one-mile and<br />\nthe Hopkins record in the two-mile.<br />\nmissing the Navy record by onefifth of a. second. His two-mile<br />\nrace was the greatest event of the<br />\nday, for after doing the mile in 4<br />\nminutes 30Y5 seconds, he won handily by some thirty yards from fresh<br />\nmen.<br />\n<br />\n(Continued on page 5, col. 2.)<br />\n<br />\nAt a senior class meeting on Friday the Prom Committee announced<br />\nthat the senior prom will take place<br />\nthe evening of June 12.

A crowded city with its<br />\ngloomy buildings and nerve-racking noises provides a poor soil for<br />\nthe planting of the seeds of tradition. A few customs, to be sure,<br />\ndid spring up; but they were never<br />\nfirmly rooted and most of them have<br />\nwithered away and died. The<br />\nchange from the three-year to a<br />\nfour-year course appears to have<br />\nbeen the principal cause of this. At<br />\nleast the decadence of our customs<br />\nseems to date from the arrival of<br />\nthe first four-year class at the University. The class-rush is almost<br />\ngone. The cane-rush no longer<br />\narouses the interest it used to do.<br />\nAnd the games in the Baltimore Lacrosse League are a poor substitute<br />\nfor the former inter-class lacrosse<br />\ngames. The Hullabaloo, alas! has<br />\nnot seen the light of day since 1909.<br />\nBut, of course, however much<br />\nwe may will to have traditions, it<br />\navails us naught. A tradition is a<br />\nplant which grows spontaneously.<br />\nLike pleasure, the more we pursue<br />\nit, the less likely are we to attain<br />\nit. We go on in our daily round<br />\nof activities and some day we wake<br />\nup to find that we have traditions.<br />\nBut it is a slow process.<br />\nOn the other hand, certain customs can be inaugurated at will.<br />\nFor instance, most colleges have a<br />\nclass day towards the end of the<br />\nyear, which is a day of general jollification. Exercises are held, a<br />\nprogram is rendered, and the seniors appear in all their glory, with<br />\ncaps and gowns. No doubt everyone will think that a cap and gown<br />\nwould look strangely out of place<br />\non Garden street. But not so.<br />\n<br />\nThe form of THE NEWS-LETTER<br />\nhas evidently appealed to others besides ourselves. The elementary<br />\nteachers of Baltimore have begun<br />\nthe publication of a monthly leaflet,<br />\nwhich in form, size of type, and<br />\nheadlines, is an exact reproduction<br />\nof our paper.<br />\n<br />\nIf you like to wear your<br />\ngloves long, wear<br />\n<br />\nFOWNES<br />\nGLOVES<br />\n<br />\nThe subscription price of THE<br />\nNEWS-LETTER for next year will<br />\nbe $2.00.

His voice was loud, his style<br />\nwas rugged; but his theme struck<br />\na sympathetic chord in the hearts<br />\nof the audience; and he was interrupted by successive bursts of applause as he proclaimed that the<br />\nhope of peace could be achieved<br />\nonly by instillincr peaceful sentimenth into the minds of the rising<br />\ngeneration.<br />\nMr. T-Towe was succeeded by a<br />\nspeaker who was his antithesis in<br />\nevery respect, Mr. Lawrence W.<br />\nBridge, of Hiram College, Ohio,<br />\nwhose mellow voice and glib erudition were expressed on tracing the<br />\n\"Evolution of World Peace.\"<br />\nAfter the first four orators had<br />\ndone, there followed an intermission. during which Mr. Uhlig refreshed the audience with two solos.<br /><br />\nThe regular annual meeting for<br />\nthe election of officers and members of the Alpha Chapter of the<br />\nhonorary fraternity, Phi Beta<br />\nKappa, was held in the Donovan<br />\nRoom, McCoy Hall, on Wednesday, May 3, at 4 o'clock. The following officers for the ensuing year<br />\nwere elected: President, Dr. L.<br />\nF. Barker; vice-president, Dr. W.<br />\nB. Clark; secretary, Dr. L. M.<br />\nRaney; treasurer, Dr. L. S.

Holland,<br />\nDr. H. A. Kelly, and Dr. L. A.<br />\nTerracher.<br />\nThe banquet which always follows the election was held Saturday evening, at 7 o'clock, in the<br />\nDonovan Room. The speaker of<br />\nthe evening was Mr. Paul Shorey.<br />\nThere was an unusually small<br />\nnumber of undergraduates elected<br />\nthis year. Only two of the four<br />\nmen who received the honor were<br />\nseniors. The other two were<br />\njuniors, Mr. Wolman and Mr.<br />\nKuehn both being members of the<br />\n1912 class who have gone through<br />\nthe University in three years. To<br />\nbe thus elected is particularly an<br />\nhonor. Several seniors, unfortunately, fell just shortof the requisite<br />\naverage for admission.<br />\nThese<br />\nmen, however, can console themselves with the thought that Hopkins is the *hardest University in<br />\nthe country to enter the Phi Beta<br />\nKappa through.<br /><br />\n. The University \u2022 lacrosse team<br />\nagain on Saturday afternoon, at<br />\nHomewood, showed its unquestioned mastery of the Indian game, and<br />\nability to play against heavy odds,<br />\nwhen they won from Lehigh by a<br />\nscore of 6 to.4. This-simple statement, however, does not tell the<br />\n,story of the game, as it was one of<br />\nthe hardest contests ever seen in<br />\nBaltimore, and for a time it looked<br />\nas .if the Varsity was going to suffer its first defeat of the season.<br />\nIt was only after Hopkins had<br />\nmade a splendid rally in the -first<br />\nhalf, scoring -three goals in less<br />\nthan that number of minutes, thus<br />\ntying the score; and after the<br />\ncoaches made material changes in<br />\nthe system of play and lineup, infusing new blood into the game as<br />\nthe. second session progressed, that<br />\nthe victory was 'really certain, and<br />\nthen in the last few Minutes of the<br />\nsecond stanza, Lehigh made a'good<br />\nspurt and, for a time was very<br />\ndangerous.<br />\nThe South I3ethlehemites showed<br />\nunexpected strength and made more<br />\nattempts at our goal than did the<br />\nVarsity at theirs.. The successful<br />\nresult can undoubtedly be attributed<br />\nto Sutton, who was a veritable<br />\nwonder between the posts, stopping<br />\nno less than twenty-five shots, many<br />\nof which 'were very 'difficult ones.<br />\nOf course so far as winning the<br />\ncontest goes, we put the praise on<br />\nthe shoulders of one of the best<br />\nattack men the game had ever produced, and take our hats off to him<br />\nnow, as we. did after the Swarthmore contest, for his two goals on<br />\nSaturday enabled Hopkins to win.<br /><br />\nOn Saturday afternoon, the Hopkins Track and Field Team met the<br />\nteam of the Naval Academy at Annapolis.<br />\nHorrax and Lee were the stars<br />\nof the contest. Horrax contributed<br />\ntwenty points to Hopkins' score by<br />\nwinning, the 120-yards hurdles, the<br />\nbroad jump, the high jump; and the<br />\npole vault; His time in the hurdles<br />\nwas only two-fifths of a .\u00a7econd<br />\nbehind the inter-collegiate record,<br />\nand almost a second better than the<br />\nNavy record. Lee won both the<br />\nmile and the two Mile runs in record time, breaking the I-Iokpins and<br />\nthe Navy marks in the one-mile and<br />\nthe Hopkins record in the two-mile.<br />\nmissing the Navy record by onefifth of a. second. His two-mile<br />\nrace was the greatest event of the<br />\nday, for after doing the mile in 4<br />\nminutes 30Y5 seconds, he won handily by some thirty yards from fresh<br />\nmen.<br /><br />\n(Continued on page 5, col. 2.)<br /><br />\nAt a senior class meeting on Friday the Prom Committee announced<br />\nthat the senior prom will take place<br />\nthe evening of June 12.

A crowded city with its<br />\ngloomy buildings and nerve-racking noises provides a poor soil for<br />\nthe planting of the seeds of tradition. A few customs, to be sure,<br />\ndid spring up; but they were never<br />\nfirmly rooted and most of them have<br />\nwithered away and died. The<br />\nchange from the three-year to a<br />\nfour-year course appears to have<br />\nbeen the principal cause of this. At<br />\nleast the decadence of our customs<br />\nseems to date from the arrival of<br />\nthe first four-year class at the University. The class-rush is almost<br />\ngone. The cane-rush no longer<br />\narouses the interest it used to do.<br />\nAnd the games in the Baltimore Lacrosse League are a poor substitute<br />\nfor the former inter-class lacrosse<br />\ngames. The Hullabaloo, alas! has<br />\nnot seen the light of day since 1909.<br />\nBut, of course, however much<br />\nwe may will to have traditions, it<br />\navails us naught. A tradition is a<br />\nplant which grows spontaneously.<br />\nLike pleasure, the more we pursue<br />\nit, the less likely are we to attain<br />\nit. We go on in our daily round<br />\nof activities and some day we wake<br />\nup to find that we have traditions.<br />\nBut it is a slow process.<br />\nOn the other hand, certain customs can be inaugurated at will.<br />\nFor instance, most colleges have a<br />\nclass day towards the end of the<br />\nyear, which is a day of general jollification. Exercises are held, a<br />\nprogram is rendered, and the seniors appear in all their glory, with<br />\ncaps and gowns. No doubt everyone will think that a cap and gown<br />\nwould look strangely out of place<br />\non Garden street. But not so.<br /><br />\nThe form of THE NEWS-LETTER<br />\nhas evidently appealed to others besides ourselves. The elementary<br />\nteachers of Baltimore have begun<br />\nthe publication of a monthly leaflet,<br />\nwhich in form, size of type, and<br />\nheadlines, is an exact reproduction<br />\nof our paper.<br /><br />\nIf you like to wear your<br />\ngloves long, wear<br /><br />\nFOWNES<br />\nGLOVES<br /><br />\nThe subscription price of THE<br />\nNEWS-LETTER for next year will<br />\nbe $2.00.
