Dr. Wood, a world renowned<br />\nlight-physicist and authority on ultra-violet and infra-red light, is actively engaged at research here in<br />\nthe physics department. At present he is studying the iodine vapor<br />\nspectrum and has written many<br />\ntreatises of scientific interest on<br />\nthese subjects.<br />\nAttention was first called to high<br />\nfrequency sound waves shortly<br />\nafter the war while experimenting<br />\non devices for the detection of submarines by reflected sound. The<br />\npeculiar effects were noted on fish<br />\nin the experimental tanks, but no<br />\nextensive research was done until<br />\nthe publication of a thesis on this<br />\nwork by Dr. Wood.<br />\nDr. Wood had conducted these<br />\nresearches in the laboratory of Dr.<br />\nAlfred Loomis, his co-worker, in<br />\ntheir laboratory at Tuxedo, New<br />\nYork.<br />\nWorld-Wide Interest<br />\n<br />\nImmediately these experiments<br />\nattracted world-wide interest, because of the unique physical and<br />\nbiological effects of these high frequency, high intensity sound waves.<br />\nDr. Wood will illustrate some of<br />\nthese curious phenomena with<br />\nslides.<br />\nDuring the war Dr. Wood, himself, was employed in an interesting<br />\nresearch.

Warfield would tell<br />\nnothing more about the play chosen<br />\nby the Barnstormers.<br />\nDouglas Prahl, business manager<br />\nof the Dramatic Club, was questioned as to the name or even the<br />\nauthor of presentation.

The financial obligations of the Playshop have been<br />\nremoved by the payment of the<br />\namount advanced on the part of<br />\nthe University Trustees for the<br />\nconstruction of the little theatre.<br />\nand with this burden removed the<br />\nmembers will be able to devote their<br />\nenergies to this year's plays.<br />\nPlans are only in the tentative<br />\nstage at present, but in case they<br />\ndecide to reproduce the American<br />\nComedy, the players have considered reviving Royal Tyler's \"Contrast.\" So far as has been determined, this is its first revival. \"Contrast\" is the first American Comedy,<br />\nand was written in 1787. Tyler,<br />\nso the story runs,'had been reared<br />\nvery strictly and had not seen any<br />\nplay. However, while on military<br />\nservice in New York, he saw<br />\n\"School for Scandal\" being played<br />\nthere. It delighted him. Under<br />\nits influence he wrote \"Contrast,\"<br />\nwhich was well received and published in 1790. Thus the first<br />\nAmerican Comedy was decidedly<br />\nimpromptu in its origin. This play<br />\nis also noteworthy because it creates<br />\nthe \"typical Yankee\" type. The<br />\nhostility of the province to the metropolis is one of its chief themes,<br />\nand it is of great historical interest<br />\nas a guide to the social conditions<br />\nof the period.

Dr. Wood, a world renowned<br />\nlight-physicist and authority on ultra-violet and infra-red light, is actively engaged at research here in<br />\nthe physics department. At present he is studying the iodine vapor<br />\nspectrum and has written many<br />\ntreatises of scientific interest on<br />\nthese subjects.<br />\nAttention was first called to high<br />\nfrequency sound waves shortly<br />\nafter the war while experimenting<br />\non devices for the detection of submarines by reflected sound. The<br />\npeculiar effects were noted on fish<br />\nin the experimental tanks, but no<br />\nextensive research was done until<br />\nthe publication of a thesis on this<br />\nwork by Dr. Wood.<br />\nDr. Wood had conducted these<br />\nresearches in the laboratory of Dr.<br />\nAlfred Loomis, his co-worker, in<br />\ntheir laboratory at Tuxedo, New<br />\nYork.<br />\nWorld-Wide Interest<br /><br />\nImmediately these experiments<br />\nattracted world-wide interest, because of the unique physical and<br />\nbiological effects of these high frequency, high intensity sound waves.<br />\nDr. Wood will illustrate some of<br />\nthese curious phenomena with<br />\nslides.<br />\nDuring the war Dr. Wood, himself, was employed in an interesting<br />\nresearch.

The Barnstormers' play.<br />\n\"Is that all that you will tell about<br />\nyour coming mystery mystery play,<br />\nMr. Warfield?\" the president of the<br />\nBarnstormers was asked.<br />\n\"Absolutely all,\" Warfield answered. \"It is a first-class mystery<br />\nplay, comprising all the elements of<br />\nsuspense, curiosity, comedy and<br />\ndrama. You will have to wait until<br />\nFebruary to find out more about it.\"<br />\nFurther questioning proved absolutely futile. Warfield would tell<br />\nnothing more about the play chosen<br />\nby the Barnstormers.<br />\nDouglas Prahl, business manager<br />\nof the Dramatic Club, was questioned as to the name or even the<br />\nauthor of presentation. He begged<br />\nall questions very cleverly by talking of the business outlook of the<br />\nclub for the coming season. Very<br />\nbright, indeed; but that's not what<br />\ninformation was wanted from him.<br />\nA trip to the Dormitory to question Jerome Nott also proved fruitless. On entering his room he was<br />\nseen to seize a small brown booklet<br />\nand slam his desk drawer closed<br />\nwith amazing alacrity. This was<br />\nsecrecy with a vengeance.<br />\n\"But why all this secrecy and<br />\nmystery, Jerry ?\" our exasperated<br />\nreporter finally asked.<br />\n\"Well, you see it's this way,\"<br />\nNott began, and immediately two<br />\ndisgruntled reporters stalked out of<br />\nthe room and slammed the door.<br />\nBribery, wheedling, trickery,<br />\neverything failed.

The financial obligations of the Playshop have been<br />\nremoved by the payment of the<br />\namount advanced on the part of<br />\nthe University Trustees for the<br />\nconstruction of the little theatre.<br />\nand with this burden removed the<br />\nmembers will be able to devote their<br />\nenergies to this year's plays.<br />\nPlans are only in the tentative<br />\nstage at present, but in case they<br />\ndecide to reproduce the American<br />\nComedy, the players have considered reviving Royal Tyler's \"Contrast.\" So far as has been determined, this is its first revival. \"Contrast\" is the first American Comedy,<br />\nand was written in 1787. Tyler,<br />\nso the story runs,'had been reared<br />\nvery strictly and had not seen any<br />\nplay. However, while on military<br />\nservice in New York, he saw<br />\n\"School for Scandal\" being played<br />\nthere. It delighted him. Under<br />\nits influence he wrote \"Contrast,\"<br />\nwhich was well received and published in 1790. Thus the first<br />\nAmerican Comedy was decidedly<br />\nimpromptu in its origin. This play<br />\nis also noteworthy because it creates<br />\nthe \"typical Yankee\" type. The<br />\nhostility of the province to the metropolis is one of its chief themes,<br />\nand it is of great historical interest<br />\nas a guide to the social conditions<br />\nof the period. This season the<br />\nPlayshop will adhere to its policy of<br />\nscholarly instruction rather th2n<br />\nentertainment.<br /><br />\nSAMUEL KIRK &amp; SON, INc.<br /><br />\ntC<br />\ny/<br /><br />\n\u2022\u2022<br /><br />\n7I,i i<br />\nfj,<br /><br />\n,--.<br />\n4<br />\n.<br /><br />\n\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022A<br /><br />\nfl<br /><br />\nto<br /><br />\ni<br /><br />\nUi<br />\ni.<br />\n\u2022-\u2022<br /><br />\n,.<br /><br />\n----<br /><br />\n-,,..7.<br /><br />\n..<br /><br />\n-..--\\,...\\\"A<br /><br />\n410, 1 .<br />\n1<br />\n:::- S I 911 1 1,/<br /><br />\n\u2022,/,'<br />\n/'1410.7).5<br />\n---\u2022<br />\n,t t .<br />\n\u2022<br />\n/6\u2022,..., /f/<br />\n'7<br />\n\"<br />\n/\u2022<br /><br />\ni -<br /><br />\n\".i\u20224_,.....<br /><br />\nVI I<br /><br />\nk,<br /><br />\n\\ 7.__LI____<br /><br />\n,% t<br /><br />\n\u2022.<br />\nfp ,.1\u2022 j\u2014<br /><br />\n40((i.40/7//s,<br /><br />\n.<br /><br />\n. .<br /><br />\n,<br /><br />\n\u2022 ,-,...<br />\n-_\u2014_-,-:<br /><br />\n.&lt;<br />\n' \u2022 14<br /><br />\n//k\u2022\u2022-t<br /><br />\n, I<br /><br />\n-;<br /><br />\n, ,..<br />\n-Th i\\, f. .<br /><br />\ntonsi.s,<br /><br />\n.s'<br />\nr<br /><br />\nIll<br /><br />\nth<br />\nof<br /><br />\n'<br />\n4<br /><br />\n_...)<br /><br />\nI<br />\n\u2014<br /><br />\nrk. 1 K-k<br /><br />\n. . . -f.. - \u201e..-_,<br />\n,<br />\ne-<br /><br />\n..\u2022<br /><br />\n.<br /><br />\n/<br /><br />\n4--&gt; ....<br />\n,..1<br /><br />\nNIkomse<br /><br />\n1<br />\n\u201e... f<br /><br />\nimtar.<br /><br />\n.<br /><br />\n..-- _,--<br /><br />\n-..\"<br /><br />\nyn<br /><br />\ni<br /><br />\n27<br /><br />\n(<br />\nalliell ii,7,,,<br />\n'7-<br /><br />\nLD<br />\nLD<br />\nGO<br />\nThe Smoother and Better Cigarette<br />\n\u2022 \u2022\u2022.not a cough in a carload<br /><br />\n1927, P.
