Nobody has really provided<br />\nspecifics; they ought to.<br />\nThe lack of clear reasons for increasing tuition is admittedly partly due to the<br />\nunusual way in which the figure came to<br />\nlight. Traditionally, the president has announced tuition increases at a special<br />\nmeeting of the Student Council, fielding<br />\nquestions right then and there. This year,<br />\nhowever, Muller told the News-Letter of<br />\nthe $800 hike in an interview.(Last year<br />\nas well, by the way, he broke tradition<br />\nby letting then Student Council President<br />\nJon Lana announce the increase prior to<br />\nMuller's presentation at the council.)<br />\nWe're by no means objecting to the<br />\nscoop this year, and it'll be just fine with<br />\nus if Muller makes announcing tuition<br />\nincreases to the News-Letter a new tradition. But having done so, he should still<br />\ngo to a council meeting.<br />\nAdmittedly, he will no longer be able<br />\nto announce the increase to a bunch of<br />\npeople who have no idea what it is, but<br />\nhe can still field questions from students<br />\nwho no doubt feel they haven't been<br />\ngiven a fair crack at the president of the<br />\nuniversity. We don't know if Student<br />\nCouncil President Paul Kadri has worked on getting Muller to a meeting, but<br />\nthat isn't really the point. If he hasn't,<br />\nhe should. If he doesn't. Muller should<br />\n<br />\ncontact Kadri and request an opportunity to address the council. The simple<br />\npoint is: Muller should definitely attend<br />\na meeting.<br />\nAnd while we're at it, let us make two<br />\nsuggestions to Muller on what to do at<br />\nthat meeting:<br />\neStay the entire time. Two years ago,<br />\nhe had the audacity to get up and walk<br />\nout after only an hour, even though there<br />\nwere still students who wanted to ask<br />\nquestion. Apparently, Muller was tired<br />\nor bored or something, so he left. It's<br />\ntrue that most students were saying<br />\nroughly the same thing, but an elementary sense of courtesy would dictate that<br />\nwhen you are telling people they have to<br />\npay another $800 to undergo the<br />\npleasures of term papers you could at<br />\nleast stick around until they've said what<br />\nthey want to.<br />\n\u2022Leave the list of 55 other schools' tuition levels at home. Every year, Muller<br />\npoints out that Hopkins ranks relatively<br />\nlow on the list, which lends an absurd air<br />\nof competition to the whole thing\u2014<br />\nalmost as if Hopkins wouldn't mind<br />\nmoving up a few notches. Nobody wants<br />\nto have a tax increase justified by<br />\nreferences to the far higher taxes they<br />\nhave to pay in Sweden.<br />\nWe're not saying the $800 increase<br />\nisn't justified; we are saying it needs further justification. By going before the<br />\ncouncil, Muller can provide some of<br />\nthat.<br />\n<br />\nBomb Threats<br />\nWriting about bomb threats is a little<br />\nlike writing about genocide: it's hard to<br />\nimagine two sides.<br />\nIt's obvious that this is simply one of<br />\nthe most obnoxious things to happen to<br />\nthe campus in years. Without accomplishing anything, it upsets the life<br />\nof every student. As the semester has<br />\nprogressed and work loads have increased, the situation has become even worse.<br />\nOften students simply must be in the<br />\nlibrary on a certain night. If research for<br />\na paper must be done, for example, the<br />\nlibrary is usually the only option.<br />\nFurthermore, the threats seem to have<br />\nno purpose. Normally one expects such<br />\nthings to be some kind of political statement. At least that's the way it's usually<br />\ndone in Beirut. But so far nobody has<br />\ncalled from the Hopkins chapter of<br />\nIslamic Jihad or the IRA or League for<br />\nthe Liberation of Librarians or some<br />\nother strange group to claim<br />\nresponsibility.<br />\nThese threats appear to be nothing<br />\nmore than mindless nuisances. Worst of<br />\nall, our guess\u2014for a couple of<br />\nreasons\u2014is that a student is behind the<br />\nwhole thing. First, nobody else would<br />\nthink to do such a thing for no apparent<br />\nreason, nor would someone else focus on<br />\nthe library. (They'd be more likely, it<br />\nseems to us, to try, say, Garland Hall.)<br />\nSecond, the security office has said it<br />\n<br />\nbelieves the calls are coming from an oncampus phone.<br />\nWhy would a student do something<br />\nlike this? Some people have suggested<br />\nthat it could be a pledge task for a fraternity, although that strikes us a bit outlandish. Surely no frat would try something<br />\nso risky, something which could easily<br />\nresult in the demise of the organization.<br />\nInstead, we tend to believe some slimy<br />\nlittle guy who thinks the whole thing is<br />\nFunny is the culprit.<br />\nThe big question, though, remains<br />\nlargely unaddressed: when should we<br />\nsimply ignore the threats and keep the<br />\nlibrary open? It is by no means an easy<br />\nproblem. Taking a risk (no matter how<br />\nslight) with people's lives is a serious<br />\ndecision. Still, we can't simply go on<br />\nevacuating the library forever. If, for example, a threat was received every night<br />\nfor the next year, one supposes that at<br />\nsome point the powers that be would<br />\nstop closing the library. (This isn't unprecedented; one of our editors was once<br />\nat a basketball game where a bomb<br />\nthreat was received, whereupon an announcement was made to the effect that<br />\nif you wanted to leave you could, but<br />\nthat play would continue.)<br />\nWe don't envy whoever ends up making the decision about keeping the library<br />\nopen. It will be a tough call, but it is one<br />\nwhich, eventually, will have to be made.<br />\n<br />\nHopkins students are the victims of a student government<br />\nsystem that does not work. It is<br />\nrun by people who truly don't<br />\ncare about the welfare of<br />\nstudents at this university. It is<br />\na home of nepotism on a grand<br />\nscale, and as an official body,<br />\nit is both ineffectual, and deaf<br />\nto the needs of students. Too<br />\noften it is just a rubber stamp<br />\nthat endorses the policies of the<br />\n\"professional\" staff members<br />\nof the school, without regard to<br />\n<br />\ntion of ideas. Too often, people who are touted as having experience merely have a long<br />\nhistory of incompetence.<br />\nThe Student Council is a<br />\nbody that has a record of not<br />\nsignificantly improving the life<br />\nof students. All recent improvements have basically been<br />\nthe contribution of the university. It is absurd that some<br />\nmembers of the student government claim responsibility for<br />\nthe increasing level of security<br />\n<br />\njoe chen<br />\nthe people who have to live with<br />\ntheir decisions. Furthermore, it<br />\nhas done more to abet than to<br />\nstop the rampant phenomena<br />\nof student apathy.<br />\nIt seems too often that the<br />\npeople who have sought office<br />\nin student government have used the office for personal ends<br />\nrather than to help students.<br />\nSadly enough, many members<br />\nhave simply regarded the office<br />\nas a wedge to go to professional<br />\nschools rather than as a means<br />\nof aiding the student welfare.<br />\nA cursory look over the candidates' statements for Young<br />\nTrustee, as well as recent issues<br />\nof the News-Letter, reveal that<br />\nmost committee memberships<br />\nand chairmanships have been<br />\ngiven to a mere handful of people. It indeed is worrisome<br />\nwhen we find that one person<br />\nmay have held five different<br />\ncommittee memberships at<br />\nHopkins, while the average student has held none, and indeed<br />\nhas little if any say in how<br />\nthings should be run. This leads<br />\nto an unhealthy degree of<br />\nhomogeneity, and to a stagna-<br />\n<br />\non campus. Clearly, the council did little in the affair, in<br />\nwhich the university had no<br />\nchoice but to improve security<br />\nor risk the reputation of the institution as a whole.<br />\nAdmittedly, the Rotunda<br />\nand White Marsh shuttles were<br />\nthe creations of the council, but<br />\nthey are grotesque examples of<br />\nthe mismanagement that exists<br />\nin the council.

Radio<br />\nstation staffers had to carry out<br />\nthe fight to retain control by<br />\nthemselves. The committee<br />\nwhich was recently formed by<br />\nthe council is a gesture, which<br />\nis too little, too late.

Part of this program<br />\nwas a panel discussion, to be<br />\nmediated by [Assistant Professor of Political Science<br />\nSteven] David, about the film's<br />\nmajor themes. The purpose of<br />\nthis program was not only to inform and educate the JHU student on the plight of the<br />\nPalestinians, but also to foster<br />\na discussion which would allow<br />\ndifferent viewpoints to present<br />\ntheir cases. In other words, the<br />\nMESA wanted student interaction on a very interesting and<br />\ncontroversial subject. The<br />\nMESA contacted the Jewish<br />\nStudents' Association, of which<br />\nDranikoff is a member, in the<br />\nhope of making this a joint effort. After some deliberation<br />\nwithin the JSA, the president<br />\nphoned me and agreed to take<br />\npart in this panel discussion.<br />\nThree days later, we received a<br />\nletter declining the invitation.<br />\nWhen I asked certain members<br />\n).<br />\n<br />\nI<br />\n<br />\nv'<br />\n<br />\n1,I\u2022<br />\n<br />\nof the JSA why they had changed their minds, they claimed<br />\nthat the film we were planning<br />\nto show was propaganda. Consequently, these certain<br />\nmembers said they were not interested in seeing the film and<br />\nwould not even show up.<br />\nFirst, the very fact that the<br />\nletter was sent by the Ad Hoc<br />\nCommittee for Peace Not Propaganda insinuated that we<br />\nwere interested in propaganda<br />\nand not peace. In fact, their<br />\nnew committee was formed<br />\nafter we invited them to participate in our program. Not<br />\nonly do I find formation of<br />\nsuch a committee hypocritical<br />\non their part, but their committee also fails to realize, again,<br />\nthe purpose of the film. The<br />\npurpose of the film was to promote disussion on an important<br />\nissue. . . .Second, I<br />\nwas<br />\nsomewhat confused<br />\nby<br />\nDranikoff's statement that we<br />\nhad to solve \"problems facing<br />\nour two groups.\" What problems? If he means groups as in<br />\nclubs, then the MESA doesn't<br />\nhave any problems with any<br />\nclubs. In fact, this it the first<br />\nmajor event that we have sponsored and our first contact with<br />\nthe JSA. Third, my feelings are<br />\nhurt by the statement: \"We<br />\nwelcome our Arab brothers into our committee...\" How<br />\nabout me and the other nonArab members? Are we invited? (Just joking.) My basic<br />\npoint is that the MESA is not<br />\ncomprised of all Arab<br />\nmembers, but in fact most of<br />\nour members are non-Arab.<br />\nI would like to address the<br />\nAd Hoc Committee for Peace<br />\nNot Propaganda's invitation<br />\nfor a private discussion. The<br />\nMESA gladly accepts this invitation, although this meeting<br />\nwill not achieve our initial objective of presenting various<br />\nviewpoints about the Palestinian plight to the J HU student<br />\nbody.<br />\nErik C'.

You have<br />\nthe JHU Barnstormers' production of Godspell, in its final<br />\nweekend in the L/V Room of<br />\nLevering Hall.<br />\nThe play, a musical comedy/drama about the life of<br />\nJesus and his teachings, opened<br />\nbefore a packed house (not a<br />\nterribly difficult feat given the<br />\nconfines of the L/V Room, but<br />\ncommendable nonetheless) last<br />\nFriday night. Seeing the<br />\nskeleton of the show during<br />\nrehearsals, I came expecting to<br />\nbe entertained, and I wasn't<br />\ndisappointed.<br />\nEntertainment is the key<br />\nword for the show, with juggling, dancing, roller skating,<br />\nand a \"rapping\" parable; audience interaction is a large part<br />\nof that entertainment\u2014passing<br />\nfootballs into the audience after<br />\na scrimmage onstage, giving<br />\naway balloons, Judas Iscariot<br />\nplaying Monty Hall and handing out money, and Tara\u2014<br />\nwell, you'll have to find out<br />\nabout Tara for yourself, all<br />\ngave the show a personal informality lacking in other adaptations I have seen.<br />\nThe entertainment was also a<br />\nproblem for me in a few<br />\ncases\u2014however,1 don't want to<br />\nsound like the Emperor in<br />\n<br />\nAmadeus, but maybe there's<br />\nonly so much comedy the senses<br />\ncan take in one play. The comic level was frenzied and<br />\nunyielding during the entire 1st<br />\nact, with no dramatic pauses<br />\nfrom the slapstick, such as were<br />\nfound in the 2nd. I realize that<br />\nthe mood of the 1st act is<br />\nupbeat, but I would have appreciated a pause or two, to let<br />\nme catch my comic breath.<br />\nThe stage setting was excellent. The use of a jungle gym<br />\ninstead of the standard chainlink fence was particularly effective. It was utilized fully by<br />\nthe characters, and worked<br />\nequally well as a comic and a<br />\ndramatic element. A lot of symbolism was built into the jungle<br />\ngym, which I must confess I did<br />\nnot realize until a cast member<br />\npointed it out to me,such as the<br />\nabstractions of the thieves'<br />\ncrosses below that of Jesus, and<br />\nthe representation of the spear.<br />\nKurt Budelmann<br />\nDuncan Smith as a dancing Jesus in Godspell.<br />\nThe backdrops, both by the<br />\nThe cast was the show, and Baltimore as in 1960's New losing to the band during solo<br />\ncast itself and by students from<br />\nthe Maryland Institute of Art, while that may seem obvious York.

This is not to say that<br />\nCrossroads operates on the<br />\nsame level of banality as that<br />\nshow, but it does prove that the<br />\nFaustus myth is alive and well<br />\nin the 1980's.<br />\n<br />\nWhen it comes- to the Blues,<br />\nwhich this movie is about,<br />\nthoroughly, the Faustus myth<br />\nworks particularly well\u2014<br />\nRobert Johnson, after all, sold<br />\nhis soul and became a virtual<br />\nBlues god, if you believe the<br />\nlegend. The Blues and the Devil<br />\nare a natural match; that is one<br />\nof the reasons this movie works<br />\nand one of the reasons it<br />\ndoesn't.<br />\nThe movie centers around<br />\nRalph Macchio, as a Juilliardschooled guitarist and selfstyled \"Lightnin' Boy,\" and<br />\nJoe Seneca, as Blues-legend<br />\n\"Blind Willie Brown.\" Willie,<br />\nit seems, knows Robert<br />\nJohnson's last unrecorded song<br />\nand the kid (name's Eugene)<br />\nthinks it'll give him the notice<br />\nhe needs to become a headlining Blues act. To get the<br />\nsong, though, Eugene must<br />\ntake Willie back home to<br />\nMississippi delta country\u2014<br />\nRobert Johnson country\u2014<br />\nwhere it just so happens Willie<br />\nalso sold his soul. Thus the<br />\nmovie: really a road film\u2014an<br />\naccount of their travels to<br />\nMississippi, the teenage<br />\nrunaway they meet along the<br />\nway(Jami Gertz), and the kid's<br />\ndevelopment from a Long<br />\nIsland boy to a Blues man. It is<br />\nthe Blues, though, that really<br />\ncarries this film, the Ry Cooder<br />\nsoundtrack running the gamut<br />\nfrom country blues to single<br />\n<br />\nstring B.B. King stuff.<br />\nThe movie is all very pleasant, well-paced, and actually<br />\none of the best natured movies<br />\nyou're bound to see but has few<br />\nmoments of any real emotional<br />\ndepth. Ralph Macchio makes a<br />\nlikeable, idealistic, Bluesworshipping kid, and Joe<br />\nSeneca, as the black whitehaired Blues giant is also very<br />\ncharming, but it's all too antiseptic; the two make a cute<br />\nand often touching pair, a<br />\nwhite kid and an elderly black<br />\nman, but it's a very slick<br />\nHollywood bond (not really the<br />\nBlues) that holds them together.<br />\nThis is ironic of course, since<br />\nthe movie says convincingly<br />\nthat the Blues can't be antiseptic by its very nature, but I<br />\ncould go on and on about<br />\nvalidity and that wouldn't<br />\nchange the fact that it's stupid<br />\nto think Hollywood would ever<br />\nrelease a film rough enough to<br />\ndo justice to the subject.<br />\nThat is not to say that this<br />\nfilm is uninteresting, it is in its<br />\nsimple and rather obvious way.<br />\nIn\" fact, the climactic conflict<br />\nfor the soul of Willie between<br />\nthe \"Lightnin' Boy\" and a<br />\nmenacing heavy metal blues<br />\nguitarist whose soul has been<br />\nlost for good, is an original and<br />\neffective twist on the Rockytype ending. So the Devil theme<br />\nworks in giving this film a really neat(though joltingly out ot<br />\n<br />\nplace in its unreality) ending<br />\nand fails in that there is no real<br />\nevil anywhere in the movie\u2014<br />\nthe only \"bad\" guy in the<br />\nmovie is a comically blatant<br />\nracist who soon gets what's<br />\ncoming to him anyway.<br />\nNevertheless, any film that<br />\neven does lip service to the likes<br />\nof Robert Johnson and Son<br />\nHouse, is all right in my book.<br />\nThere hasn't been a major motion picture like this since The<br />\nBlues Brothers and even that<br />\nmovie emphasized the R&B side<br />\nof things instead of the rootsy<br />\ndelta Blues of Crossroads. And<br />\nthe Blues is still strong enough<br />\nto triumph over the rather<br />\nsimplistic plot. Crossroads is a<br />\nmovie which, despite internal<br />\nclaims to the contrary, treats<br />\nthe Blues idealistically and antiseptically, which just happens<br />\nto be the way most people, including myself, regard the<br />\nBlues\u2014after all, I came home<br />\nafter the movie to play my<br />\nLeadbelly and Robert Pete<br />\nWilliams albums on my stateof-the-art stereo. The Blues<br />\nmakes<br />\nsome<br />\nuniversal<br />\nstatements about the human<br />\ncondition\u2014for this reason the<br />\nmovie works. In fact, Blues<br />\njunkies may actually want to<br />\nsee this film a few times\u2014<br />\nmoments like these are a<br />\nprecious few.<br />\n<br />\n\fNEWS-LETTER/13<br />\n<br />\nGoode Piano<br />\nby Jason Hanson<br />\nRepetition<br />\ndoes<br />\nnot<br />\nnecessarily lead to boredom in<br />\nall cases.

He has appeared with the New York<br />\nPhilharmonic, the National<br />\nSymphony, and the Baltimore<br />\nSymphony Orchestra. He is a<br />\nrecipient of the Avery Fischer<br />\nPrize and has won a Grammy<br />\nAward (1982)in the category of<br />\n\"Best<br />\nChamber<br />\nMusic<br />\nPerformance.\"<br />\nMozart's \"Sonata in F Major,\" one of his later works,<br />\nwas the first piece to be performed. The work contains two<br />\nmovements and a Rondo section at the end. Written later in<br />\nMozart's life, it contains a<br />\nsignificant amount of counterpoint in the first movement.<br />\nThis requires that the pianist<br />\nplay not one but two of<br />\nMozart's incredibly lively<br />\nmelodies in each hand, intertwining and juxtaposing them<br />\nthroughout the passage.<br />\nThe second movement,<br />\nmarked Andante, reflected a<br />\nmore somber side of Mozart<br />\ncharacteristic of his later works.<br />\nSlow arpeggios in the lower<br />\nregister underlay a more \"composed\" less spontaneous<br />\nmelody. Goode certainly<br />\nbecame rapt in this piece, his intense facial expressions convey-<br />\n<br />\ning the dismalness of what he<br />\nwas playing.(Now I am not an<br />\nultra-purist when it comes to<br />\nperformance, but during this<br />\nAndante section, Mr. Goode<br />\nbecame so ra,)t in the music<br />\nthat he did not realize that his<br />\noff-key humming with his<br />\nmusic was becoming audible to<br />\nthe audience and detracting<br />\nfrom the piece. Still, I have<br />\nbeen told by those wiser than 1<br />\nthat even \"the Greats\" hummed<br />\noff-key.)<br />\nGoode next proffered<br />\nBeethoven's \"Sonata No. 29 in<br />\nA.\" Goode's performance<br />\nof the first movement was as<br />\nlyric and expansive as his execution of the second was<br />\nregimented and unswerving.<br />\nLikewise, Goode's evocative<br />\nperformance of the third movement revealed the intensity of<br />\nthe passion that at this time<br />\nbegan - creeping<br />\nfrom<br />\nBeethoven's symphonic works<br />\ninto his chamber music writing,<br />\nwhile his playing of the fourth<br />\nbrought to the fore Beethoven's<br />\nfamiliar penchant for harsh<br />\nmelodies.<br />\nThe final piece of the evening was Beethoven's \"Sonata<br />\nNo. 32 in C Minor.\" The form<br />\nof the sonata is a departure<br />\nfrom the norm, it being divided<br />\ninto two movements instead of<br />\nfour. Goode's powerful reading<br />\nof the first movement,<br />\nMaestoso; Allegro con brio ed<br />\napassionato, seemed to be a<br />\nstatement of itself. Its severe<br />\npassion reverberated into even<br />\nthe furthest corners of the Hall.<br />\nOn the whole, Goode's<br />\nperformance was compelling,<br />\nbeing fraught with enormity,<br />\nand technical rectitude.<br />\n<br />\nHannah is Allen's Finest<br />\nby Laurah Limbrick<br />\nHannah and Her Sisters is<br />\nWoody Allen's latest film, and<br />\nhis finest yet as a director. He<br />\nalso wrote it, and if you go to<br />\nsee it expecting the hilarity of<br />\nsome of his earlier work, you<br />\nmay be in for a disappointment. Allen has been moving<br />\naway from straight comedy for<br />\nthe last few years, and Hannah<br />\nand Her Sisters marks a kind of<br />\nprecarious marriage between<br />\ncomedy and drama. It works.<br />\nSo well, as a matter of fact, that<br />\nit wasn't really unnerving when<br />\nthe action shifted from one to<br />\nthe other. It's very reminiscent<br />\nof 1978's Interiors, but decidely more upbeat.<br />\nHannah and Her Sisters is<br />\nthe story of three sisters and the<br />\nchanges in their lives over a<br />\nperiod of two years. We start at<br />\nThanksgiving dinner, and by<br />\nthe time we return one year<br />\n<br />\nGodspell<br />\n<br />\nlater, everyone's lives have<br />\nchanged in some significant<br />\nway.

It has been<br />\nmore than a year since his<br />\nprevious novel, The Aquitaine<br />\nProgression, disappointed both<br />\nreaders and critics, causing many<br />\nto wonder if Ludlum had gone<br />\nstale, lost his touch. Any such<br />\nfears should be alleviated by The<br />\nBourne Supremacy. This newest<br />\nbook, his thirteenth to date, is a<br />\ngripping, well-crafted thriller in<br />\nthe finest Ludlum tradition.<br />\nLudlum's first sequel continues the chilling saga of Jason<br />\nBourne. In Ludlum's earlier<br />\nbestseller, The Bourne Identity,<br />\nwe were introduced to Jason<br />\nBourne, the world's premier<br />\nassassin-for-hire. Over the course<br />\nof the novel, Bourne hunted<br />\nCarlos, a rival assassin,<br />\nthroughout Europe, and began<br />\nto rediscover his true identity as<br />\nDavid Webb.<br />\nThe Bourne Supremacy<br />\nresumes the story with David<br />\nWebb recovering peacefully<br />\nwith his new wife in a small college town in Maine. His tranquil life is soon shattered,<br />\nhowever. Government authorities decide they need his<br />\nskills, his expertise, once again.<br />\nAn impostor is loose in Asia. A<br />\nnew killer, using Jason<br />\nBourne's name and reputation,<br />\nthreatens to disrupt the delicate<br />\nbalance of power and trade in<br />\nChina if he is not stopped.<br />\n<br />\nAt the highest levels of U.S.<br />\nGovernment a decision is made.<br />\nDavid Webb must return to<br />\nAsia, and must unmask the impostor and his mysterious<br />\nclient. To accomplish this,<br />\nWebb's wife Marie is kidnapped, and a trail left for him to<br />\nfollow into Asia. As he chases<br />\nacross the world, Webb realizes<br />\nthat in order to succeed in his<br />\nmission and find his wife, he<br />\nmust use that part of himself he<br />\nmost fears. He must return to<br />\nbeing Jason Bourne.<br />\nThus Ludlum sets the stage<br />\nfor one of the most exciting and<br />\nbelievable novels as Bourne<br />\nraces through Asia, following<br />\ncountless twists, and uncovering deadly deceptions and<br />\nbetrayals.<br />\nIn many ways, The Bourne<br />\nSupremacy is Robert Ludlum's<br />\nbest work ever. This is largely<br />\ndue to his skillful development<br />\nof his characters. Ludlum produces a very complete picture<br />\nof David Webb, frantic as he<br />\nsearches for his wife. He must<br />\ncombat hostile forces all<br />\naround him, while compromising with his own alternate identity of Jason Bourne\u2014the<br />\nmaster assassin. This battle<br />\nagainst both unseen and internal enemies heightens the effect<br />\nof an already intricate plot, and<br />\nmakes Webb's task even more<br />\ndifficult. Slowly we see Webb<br />\ngrow more and more reliant<br />\nupon the deadly talents of<br />\nJason Bourne, and he comes to<br />\naccept the value of both parts<br />\nof himself. It is here that<br />\nLudlum displays his skill,<br />\nshowing the conflict between<br />\nWebb and Bourne admirably,<br />\nand without confusing the<br />\n<br />\nreader.<br />\nThe scene early in the book,<br />\nwhen he discovers his wife has<br />\nbeen kidnapped, demonstrates<br />\nthe smoothness of his switches<br />\nfrom one personality to<br />\nanother, and sets the tone of<br />\nhe novel:<br />\nWebb screamed, falling<br />\nonto the pillows, trying to<br />\nmute the outrage and the<br />\nhorror that came from his<br />\nthroat, pushing back the<br />\npain that swept through<br />\nhis temples. Then he<br />\nturned over and stared at<br />\nthe ceiling, a terrible<br />\nbrute passivity coming<br />\nover him.<br />\nHe knew the two men<br />\nwithin him that made up<br />\nhis whole being. He<br />\nwould always remember<br />\nthe one becuase it was the<br />\nman he wanted to be, but<br />\nfor the time being he had<br />\nto be the other...<br />\nJason Bourne rose !loin<br />\nthe bed and opened the<br />\ndrawci. Inside were two<br />\nautomadismantled<br />\ntics...<br />\nA man often at war with<br />\nhimself, Webb/Bourne is much<br />\nmore human than many of<br />\nLudlum's previous characters.<br />\nWebb is often horrified at the<br />\natrocities Jason Bourne commits, yet he knows they must be<br />\ncommitted if he is to find his<br />\nwife again. This makes it much<br />\neasier to identify with him than<br />\nwith some of Ludlum's superspies, who usually display little<br />\ncompassion or sympathy for<br />\nanyone else. In this way<br />\nLudlum has improved his<br />\ncharacter development, and<br />\ncreated a hero, who, although<br />\n<br />\ndir<br />\nRobert Ludlum\u2014Author of The<br />\nvo?<br />\nBourne Supremacy<br />\n<br />\nsomewhat less than perfect, is<br />\nexceedingly believable.<br />\nAt the same time, the governwho<br />\nauthorities<br />\nment<br />\nmanipulate David Webb are<br />\nalso genuine characters. Unlike<br />\nthose in several previous<br />\nLudlum novels\u2014in which<br />\npowerful were at worst<br />\n\"maniacs\", and at best<br />\nincompetent\u2014the government<br />\nfigures in The Bourne<br />\nSupremacy are fleshed out a little. They are shown as torn between their duty to prevent<br />\nchaos and bloodshed in the Far<br />\nEast, and the guilt they feel for<br />\nmanipulating Webb and his<br />\nwife, subjecting them both to<br />\nunimaginable horrors and terrifying risks.<br />\nAn interesting parallel is<br />\ndrawn between Webb, committing violence he abhors in order<br />\nto find his wife, and McAllister,<br />\nthe undersecretary of state, who<br />\nrisks the lives of an innocent<br />\n<br />\ncouple to prevent even more<br />\nkillings. The comparison between these two men gives insights into motivations beyond<br />\nthe scope of the novel.<br />\nFinally, Ludlum has expanded the character of Marie,<br />\nDavid's wife. Although we only see one side of her personality, she does in many respects<br />\nrepresent the focus of the book.<br />\nIn that respect, Ludlum has improved upon his usual heroine,<br />\nwho in earlier works was often<br />\nsimply a background figure.<br />\nIn short, with The Bourne<br />\nSupremacy, Robert Ludlum<br />\nhas managed to expand<br />\ncharacter development, while<br />\npreserving the fast-paced,<br />\ntightly-woven, twisting plot<br />\nthat his followers have come to<br />\nexpect. It is arguably his best<br />\nwork yet, and his readers can<br />\nonly hope he will continue to<br />\nproduce novels of this quality.<br />\n<br />\nA Solid Demonstration of a Good Story<br />\nSouthern Light<br />\nmusic.

A little-known drug<br />\njust ten years ago, PCP is<br />\nbecoming the drug of choice in<br />\nD.C. and other metropolitan<br />\nareas. The great concern of<br />\npolice officials, mental health<br />\nworkers, teachers, and the<br />\nmedical community is not unfounded. According to James<br />\nHendricks, head of the PCP<br />\nTask Force in Prince George's<br />\nCounty, and regional director<br />\nof Second Genesis, a private<br />\ndrug treatment center,\"PCP is<br />\nthe most dangerous drug on the<br />\nmarket today.\" The increased<br />\nuse of the drug by teenagers<br />\nand even younger children is<br />\nalso a major reason for<br />\nconcern.<br />\nThe history of PCP use in<br />\nthis country is somewhat<br />\nuneven. In 1967, about two<br />\nyears after Parke-Davis discontinued clinical trials of the drug,<br />\nit emerged on the streets of<br />\nCalifornia under the name<br />\n\"PeaCe Pill.\" Although<br />\npsychedelic drugs were popular<br />\nat that time, the extreme<br />\nhallucinogenic effects of PCP<br />\nwere apparently found unpleasant, and it was rejected by the<br />\ndrug community. In 1%8,PCP<br />\nappeared in New York City<br />\nunder the name \"Hog\", but<br />\ndidn't catch on in popularity<br />\nthere, either. Soon after that,<br />\ndealers around the country<br />\nbegan selling PCP in disguise,<br />\nclaiming it was THC,<br />\nmescaline, LSD, or other<br />\ndesirable psychedelic drugs. In<br />\n<br />\nthen noticed in the newspaper of PCP in Baltimore City.<br />\nthat a major illicit PCP lab had There are still, however, quite<br />\nrecently been busted, just at the a few PCP users, especially in<br />\ntime that the adolescent the southwest part of Baltimore<br />\npsychosis dropped off.

At least with marijuana,<br />\nyou're still in touch with your<br />\nsurroundings.\"<br />\ntion and use is occurring. Unlike<br />\nother drugs, though, PCP<br />\nmanufacture appears to be confined to a few \"hot spots\"<br />\naround the country. Los<br />\nAngeles seems to have the worst<br />\nproblem, followed closely by<br />\nthe \"Route 95 Corridor,\" the<br />\narea encompassing Washington<br />\nD.C., Prince George's County,<br />\nAnne Arundel County, Arlington, Virginia, and other areas<br />\nsouthwest of Baltimore. Other<br />\ncities, including Detroit and<br />\nChicago, are also seeing an increase in the problem.<br />\nPCP is sold under many<br />\nstreet names, including \"angel<br />\ndust,\" \"flakes,\" \"rocket<br />\nfuel,\" and \"killer weed.\" Marijuana sprayed with PCP is<br />\nknown as \"loveboat,\" or<br />\n\"lovely.\" A PCP-soaked marijuana cigarette is known as a<br />\n\"Sherman,\" and sells for<br />\n$40-$75 on the street. PCP is<br />\noften packaged in 35 mm film<br />\ncannisters, which sell in<br />\nBaltimore for $50 , and yield<br />\nbetween 5-6 cigarettes. It is also<br />\nsold in tin foil or vanilla bot-<br />\n<br />\n\"We see kids younger and younger<br />\ncoming in for treatment programs. . . and they're saying it's in<br />\nthe schools.\"<br />\nthe early 1970's many universities, including the University<br />\nof Maryland, began setting up<br />\ndrug analysis laboratories<br />\nwhich<br />\npublicized<br />\nthe<br />\nmisrepresentation that was occurring. After this, the sale of<br />\npsychedelic drugs declined, and<br />\nit appeared that the PCP problem was over. After a quiet<br />\nperiod of about four years,<br />\nhowever, PCP reemerged\u2014this<br />\ntime as the preferred drug in a<br />\nyounger population of abusers.<br />\nTwo high production areas appeared, one on the West Coast,<br />\nand the other in Washington<br />\nD.C. and its surrounding<br />\ncounties.<br />\nAround this time, Dr. Paul<br />\nLuisada, a psychiatrist<br />\nElizabeth's Hospital in<br />\nSoutheast Washington, noted a<br />\nrapid rise in adolescent<br />\npsychosis admissions, far above<br />\nbaseline levels. Then, just as<br />\nquickly as it fell rose, it fell off.<br />\nLuisada was puzzled at first, but<br />\n<br />\nties. Street prices tend to vary<br />\nin different areas.<br />\nAlthough the drug penalties<br />\nwere recently increased in<br />\nMaryland, possession of PCP is<br />\nstill considered a misdemeanor,<br />\nwith a maximum sentence of<br />\nfour years, and/or a $10,000<br />\nfine. Distribution of PCP<br />\nis a felony, and carries a<br />\nmaximum penalty of twenty<br />\nyears and/or a $25,000 fine.<br />\nDetective Melvin Utz, of the<br />\nBaltimore City Police Narcotics<br />\nUnit, feels that the penalties are<br />\nnot tough enough.<br />\nSo far, Baltimore City has<br />\nmanaged to stay clear of the<br />\nPCP epidemic. In 1981, Captain Joseph Newman, head of<br />\nthe drug enforcement unit of<br />\nthe Baltimore City Police<br />\nDepartment, tripled the<br />\nnumber of detectives in the<br />\nunit, putting special emphasis<br />\non cocaine, heroin and PCP.<br />\nAs far as Detective Utz knows,<br />\nthere are now no manufacturers<br />\n<br />\n4..sool.441641.4.4<br />\n<br />\nhowever, cocaine and heroin<br />\nare much more of a problem in<br />\nBaltimore City than is PCP.<br />\nIn Washington D.C., the<br />\nstory is quite different. There,<br />\nPCP is becoming the drug of<br />\nchoice. According to a<br />\nWashington Post article, while<br />\nthere were 310 arrests for PCP<br />\npossession or sale in 1981, the<br />\nnumber had increased to 3,030<br />\narrests by 1985. In contrast,<br />\nBaltimore police made only 226<br />\nPCP arrests in 1985. While the<br />\npopulation of D.C. is greater<br />\nthan that of Baltimore, the<br />\nnumber of PCP arrests there is<br />\nstill disproportionately high.<br />\nThe emergency room<br />\nstatistics in Prince George's<br />\nCounty are equally as alarming.<br />\nAccording to the county's PCP<br />\nTask Force report, of the 651<br />\ndrug patients admitted in 1984,<br />\n372 were PCP cases. In addition, 17 percent of the PCP patients at Second Genesis in<br />\nApril of last year were under<br />\nthe age of 21. According to<br />\nHendricks, \"We see kids<br />\nyounger and younger coming in<br />\nfor treatment programs...and<br />\nthey're saying it's in the<br />\nschools.\"<br />\nNobody seems to know why<br />\nthe PCP problem is so concentrated in certain areas and not<br />\nin others. Cocaine, heroin, and<br />\n<br />\nmost other illicit drugs are fairly evenly distributed around the<br />\ncountry. The disparity may be<br />\ndue, in part, to the quality of<br />\npolice enforcement in the<br />\nvarious areas. Another<br />\npossibility is cultural differences. The low price of PCP<br />\nrelative to that of other drugs<br />\nis attractive in areas with high<br />\npoverty levels. Poor teenagers<br />\nmake up a high percentage of<br />\nPCP users in D.C. and Los<br />\nAngeles. In addition, PCP<br />\nseems to be associated with a<br />\n\"macho\" image among<br />\nHispanic youths in Los Angeles<br />\nand unemployed blacks in<br />\n,Washington.<br />\nThere is not, however, a<br />\n\"typical\" PCP user. According<br />\nto Utz, \"We're talking about<br />\npeople from all walks of life.\"<br />\nOf the 57 patients at Second<br />\nGenesis last April, 29 were<br />\nwhite, and 28 black. The age of<br />\nusers ranges from young<br />\nchildren to adults in their 30's.<br />\nUsers are usually low to middle<br />\nin economic status, and men<br />\n<br />\ntend to outnumber women.<br />\nThe reasons for using PCP<br />\nmay differ as well. While some<br />\nsee it as a \"macho\" or \"cool\"<br />\nthing to do, others may use it<br />\nto separate themselves from<br />\ntheir problems. As with most<br />\ndrugs, PCP provides an escape<br />\nfrom reality. This effect with<br />\nPCP, however, is much more<br />\nextreme. Carol Palmer, a<br />\ncounselor at the Jones Falls<br />\nCommunity Corporation in<br />\nHampden, says, \"There's a<br />\nwith<br />\ncomplete removal<br />\nPCP...at least with marijuana, you're still in touch with<br />\nyour surroundings.\" According<br />\nto Melissa Lucas, also of Jones<br />\nFalls, \"The earmark of a PCP<br />\nuser would be someone who's<br />\nnot uncomfortable with a sense<br />\nof unreality.\" This \"unreality\"<br />\nis what makes PCP the most<br />\ndangerous drug on the streets<br />\ntoday. The \"escape\" it provides leads users to horrible acts<br />\nof violence, often with tragic<br />\nContinued on Page 17<br />\n<br />\nBaltimore City Police Dept.<br />\n<br />\nSome of the chemicals used in the manufacture of PCP.<br />\n<br />\nChallenges in Medical Education<br />\nby Meidee Goh<br />\nOn Tuesday, March 4, 1986,<br />\nthe last presentation in this<br />\nyear's William Henry Welch<br />\nLecture Series: The Culture of<br />\nMedicine, featured Dr. Richard<br />\nS. Ross, vice president for<br />\nmedicine at the Johns Hopkins<br />\nMedical School. He presented<br />\nhis views on medical education<br />\ntoday and in the future in a talk<br />\nentitled \"Challenges in Medical<br />\nEducation.\"<br />\nDr. Ross began by explaining<br />\nthe medical school selection<br />\nprocess in the U.S. and expressed<br />\nhis opinion on how this may<br />\nchange in the future. He<br />\nbelieves the studies which<br />\npredict an oversupply of doctors by the year 2000 and thinks<br />\nthat cut-backs in admissions<br />\nshould be made to maintain the<br />\nquality of doctors. At present,<br />\nthere are 16,000 spaces in<br />\n<br />\n01 46.4P<br />\n411vViV44111011,<br />\ncirApvio......,0~..:0101A4.'x4t10101,<br />\n<br />\nmedical schools in the U.S. and<br />\ntwice as many students. Those<br />\nwho do not enter U.S. medical<br />\nschools eventually find their<br />\nway to offshore medical<br />\nschools which provide education of questionable quality.<br />\nUsing the open admission,<br />\npolicies in Belgium and Italy as<br />\nan example, he noted that the<br />\ndoctor glut in these countries<br />\nhas had a negative effect on the<br />\nquality of medical service.<br />\nCases of unnecessary medication, testing, and perhaps<br />\nsurgery were noted. Due to the<br />\nshortage of legitimate jobs,<br />\nqualified physicians have had to<br />\nfind other occupations to support themselves since the laws<br />\nof supply and demand do not<br />\napply to medicine, active steps<br />\nshould be taken to maintain<br />\nquality, he said.<br />\nAt present U.S. medical<br />\nschools look for students with<br />\n<br />\nmain<br />\ntwo<br />\nattributes:<br />\nhumanitarianism and the ability to master the basic sciences.<br />\nDr. Ross felt that there tended<br />\nto be an overemphasis placed<br />\non competence in science. In an<br />\nattempt to de-emphasize this<br />\narea, Hopkins has decided to<br />\nmake the MCAT's optional.<br />\nThe judgment would then be<br />\nbased on grades, recommendations and personality. The test<br />\nseems merely to prepare the student for test taking and distorts<br />\nthe undergraduate experience.<br />\nHowever, this does not mean<br />\nthat medical schools would<br />\nlower their academic standards<br />\nto accept more humanitarians.<br />\nHumanitarianism and competence in science are not<br />\nmutually exclusive.<br />\nA high premium should be<br />\nput on the maturity of students.<br />\nContinued on Page 17<br />\n<br />\n\fMedical Education<br />\nContinued from Page 16<br />\n<br />\nThus, the Flex-med program at<br />\nHopkins was developed to<br />\nreplace early admission. This<br />\nprogram guarantees early admission with late matriculation.<br />\nStudents accepted through this<br />\nprogram during their junior<br />\nyear can finish their senior year<br />\nwithout the usual pressures.<br />\nThis would allow the student to<br />\naccept risks and challenges he<br />\nwould not have taken previously and enhance his senior year<br />\nexperience. A second option in<br />\nthe Flex-med program allows<br />\nstudents to spend a year at a<br />\nspecial study or work program<br />\nprior to matriculation. Adding<br />\ncharacter and maturity to the<br />\nstudent body provides a diversified class and increases the<br />\nlearning experience.<br />\nMedical schools train<br />\nstudents to serve society<br />\nthrough the use of biomedical<br />\nscience. The current curriculum<br />\nenough<br />\nprovides<br />\nnot<br />\nhumanities. There was a proposal to add courses in English,<br />\nhistory, and philosophy to a<br />\nmedical student's training.<br />\nHowever, Dr. Ross felt that<br />\nthere is already so much information to assimilate that<br />\nnothing more can be added due<br />\nto time constraints. The selectivity in the learning process is<br />\nnot being done very well;<br />\ncourses should concentrate on<br />\nthe principles of biomedical<br />\nscience rather than on the<br />\ndetails, Ross said. In the future,<br />\nthe use of computers to provide<br />\neasy access to information will<br />\nreduce the amount of information that students must commit<br />\nto memory. Hands on experience in the laboratory<br />\nshould be increased by cutting<br />\nback on lecture time by 25-50<br />\npercent. Lab study in gross<br />\nanatomy and physiology may<br />\nbe difficult to continue in the<br />\nfuture due to the sensitivity of<br />\nthe public to animal experimentation, cost, and lack of<br />\nfacilities. According to Ross,<br />\nlab exposure allows students to<br />\nsee if they like research and<br />\nwidens the experiences of the<br />\nstudents. He said the clinical<br />\ncurriculum should be guided by<br />\nthe needs of society rather than<br />\nthe interests of the professors.<br />\nThe pressures placed on the<br />\nmedical profession by society<br />\nhas altered the education of a<br />\nmedical student to a certain extent. Due to cost control, the<br />\nhospital stay of a patient today<br />\nhas been considerably reduced.<br />\nThis makes it impossible to<br />\ndevelop the patient-student<br />\nrelationship. According to<br />\n<br />\nRoss, there is no room for the<br />\nstudent in the system. Presently, the student-patient contact<br />\ncan only be developed in outpatient situations. However,<br />\nthis is not cost efficient since<br />\nthe qualified physicians on staff<br />\ncould be more productive<br />\nwithout the students. Thus<br />\nthese education programs have<br />\nto be subsidized.<br />\nThe changing trend in the<br />\npopulation distribution will affect the emphasis of certain<br />\ntopics in the curriculum. The<br />\nU.S. population in 1983 had<br />\nmore people 65 years or older<br />\nthan teenagers. Hence the problems of the elderly must be<br />\ndealt with by the students. This<br />\nhas led to a change in attitude<br />\ntoward geriatrics. No longer are<br />\nthe requirements only tender<br />\nloving care. The importance in<br />\nresearch on the diseases of the<br />\nelderly such as senile dimentia<br />\nhas increased within the last few<br />\nyears.<br />\nIn response to the subject of<br />\ncorporate medicine and Health<br />\nMaintainance Organizations<br />\n(HMOs), he felt that research<br />\nwould become a more popular<br />\ncareer choice. There will be few<br />\ndoctors in solo practice as the<br />\nHMOs and corporations hire<br />\nmore and more doctors. This<br />\nwould lead to competition,<br />\ndecrease in the cost of medicine<br />\nand thus a reduction in the<br />\nphysician's income.<br />\nThe present increasing trend<br />\nin the number of malpractice<br />\nsuits has led to the practice of<br />\n\"defensive medicine.\" Dr.<br />\nRoss said that many cases were<br />\ndue to \"bad luck\" rather than<br />\nany intentional abuse of the<br />\nsystem. The uncertainty in<br />\nmedicine will always be there<br />\ndue to the biological link. He<br />\nfeels that society has become<br />\nless tolerant of the fact that<br />\nmedicine is still not an exact<br />\nscience.<br />\nIn conclusion, Dr. Ross<br />\nstated that medicine is still a<br />\ngood career choice since it combines humanitarianism with<br />\ncompetence in science. Financial support for students will<br />\nprobably have to increase to<br />\ncope with the rising cost in<br />\nmedical education. His only<br />\nfear is the fact that students<br />\nmay enter a field based on<br />\neconomic needs rather than<br />\ninterest.<br />\nRoss received his MD from<br />\nHarvard Medical School.

Many of you<br />\nmay have heard a recent radio<br />\nannouncement from the Pharmakinetics Laboratory, calling<br />\nfor healthy males to participate<br />\nin a drug test. Undoubtedly, the<br />\nthing that caught your attention<br />\nwas the amount of money being offered to take part in the<br />\nprogram. As one of many<br />\nfinancially-struggling students<br />\ncaught in the grip of yet<br />\nanother tuition hike, I decided<br />\nthat an investigation couldn't<br />\nhurt.<br />\nAs the announcement stated,<br />\nhealthy, non-allergic, nondiseased males between the ages<br />\nof nineteen and fifty were needed. I seemed to fit these prerequisites, so I called the number<br />\nto set up a time for a free<br />\nphysical. A pleasant, cheerful<br />\nvoice warned me not to eat<br />\nanything, especially any caffeine products, for at least<br />\nseven hours before the physical.<br />\nI was also prohibited from taking any medication, including<br />\naspirin, for two weeks prior to<br />\nmy appointment. The time was<br />\nset at 8:00 a.m., on a Monday.<br />\nThe voice didn't seem to be so<br />\npleasant now. By the time it<br />\ntold me I also couldn't drink<br />\nany form of alcohol for at least<br />\nforty-eight hours before that<br />\nMonday (which meant a dry<br />\nweekend), the voice had<br />\nbecome downright obnoxious.<br />\n1 found myself wondering what<br />\nwould be harder to do<br />\nwithout\u2014tea or tequila.<br />\nAnyway, I suffered through<br />\nmy \"probationary\" period<br />\n(which, incidentally, was worse<br />\nthan being in Orgo lab, if you<br />\ncan believe that) and arrived at<br />\nPharmakinetics Inc. at the<br />\nspecified time. The facility is<br />\nlocated at 104 East 25th Street,<br />\na short seven blocks from campus. Pharmakinetics has been<br />\nin business for more than ten<br />\nyears, and more than eight<br />\nthousand men have taken part<br />\nin their vaious surveys. The offices were bright and colorful,<br />\nwith labworkers running busily up and down stairs. A few<br />\ndoctors walked purposefully<br />\nfrom room to room. I was<br />\ndirected to the receptionist by<br />\none of many enthusiastic<br />\nmonitors which kept the place<br />\nrunning smoothly. The medical<br />\ndirector, Melvin Sharoky,<br />\nM.D., came in every now and<br />\nthen as I filled out a detailed<br />\nfamily-health screening form.<br />\nA short blond woman named<br />\nAlicia then went over the form<br />\nwith me very carefully. She was<br />\nobviously well-trained and even<br />\nsqueezed a third-grade Little<br />\nLeague injury that I had<br />\nneglected to mention out of my<br />\nmemory. I then went into a<br />\ntypical-looking doctor's office<br />\nand was given a blood test, a<br />\nurine test, and a physical examination. After this, I was led<br />\nto a seminar room. I sat in with<br />\na group of other candidates and<br />\nwe listened to an information<br />\nsession given by yet another<br />\nassistant.<br />\nFirst of all, to those a little<br />\n<br />\nGanesh Ramachandran<br />\n<br />\nAaron 1)a is, a \"health) )oung male betN\u2018een the ages ()I' 19 and 50,\"<br />\ns\u2018ho is participating in the l'harmakineties studs.<br />\n<br />\nwary of being guinea pigs,<br />\nPharmakinetics, for the most<br />\npart, does not test the safety of<br />\nany drugs. The medicines which<br />\nare tested have all been in use<br />\nfor more than seventeen years.<br />\nThe company tests the diffusion rates of different varieties<br />\nof these medicines. As<br />\neverybody knows, certain<br />\nmedicines and foodstuffs come<br />\nin two different forms; brandname or \"labeled,\" and noname or generic. There is an<br />\nongoing debate within the pharmaceutical business as to<br />\nwhether the more expensive<br />\nbrand-name drugs are, in fact,<br />\nfaster or more effective than the<br />\ncheaper generic medicines.<br />\nPharmakinetics deals mainly<br />\nwith cold-remedies, high-blood<br />\npressure medicine, hyperactivity drugs and the like.(To those<br />\nseeking a cheap thrill, forget it.<br />\nThese are about as exciting as<br />\nan 8:00 a.m. lecture.) The<br />\ndosages, however, are very<br />\nsmall and will not affect a preexisting condition. Indeed, if<br />\nafter checking your blood and<br />\nyour chart, the very thorough<br />\nstaff at Pharmakinetics finds<br />\nthat any type of reaction is<br />\npossible you will not be allowed to participate.<br />\nBut you want to hear about<br />\nmoney, right? The payment for<br />\nparticipation depends upon the<br />\nduration of the study, with<br />\nsums ranging from 100 to over<br />\n1000 dollars. The testing procedure itself is rather<br />\nstraightforward and simple.<br />\nYou are given a dosage of a certain medicine A. A set amount<br />\nof time later, a blood or urine<br />\nsample is given. The amount of<br />\nmedicine in this sample is then<br />\ncompared with a \"clean\" sample taken earlier or on the day<br />\nof your physical. The procedure is then repeated some<br />\ntime later with medicine B, and<br />\nthe diffusion rates compared.<br />\nObviously, caffeine or alcohol<br />\ncan have a profound effect<br />\nupon these diffusion rates.<br />\nLikewise, digesting food may<br />\nabsorb the medicine or slow the<br />\ncirculation. Hence, it is very important to follow Pharmakinetics' regulations regarding these things.<br />\nThere are two basic types of<br />\nstudies done at the facility.<br />\n\"Check-in\" studies usually<br />\nconsist of visiting the office<br />\nevery other day for a week or<br />\nso and giving a sample. \"Overnights\" are the second type of<br />\nstudy, and are far more<br />\nlucrative. Overnights usually<br />\ntake place from Friday to<br />\nSaturday, although other nights<br />\nmay be specified. The participants report to the office at<br />\na certain time on Friday. They<br />\n<br />\nare then bussed to a downtown<br />\nhotel, and given a room to<br />\nshare. After arriving, the subjects change to hospital scrubs<br />\nand T-shirts. Dinner is served<br />\nand usually consists of a Big<br />\nMac, western fries, and a large<br />\nCoke. A late-night snack may<br />\nalso be given. As can be expected, food intake is<br />\nmonitored very carefully, and<br />\nany food not eaten is carefully<br />\nnoted by the assistants. Dosage<br />\nis given at a set time, after<br />\nwhich, the participants are free<br />\nto do as they wish until the 1:00<br />\na.m. lights-out. This is an excellent time to do homework,<br />\nplay cards, or just meet new<br />\npeople. Nobody, however, is<br />\nallowed to leave the premises.<br />\nThe subjects are waked up<br />\nearly to give a sample. A series<br />\nof subsequent samples are<br />\ntaken throughout the day and<br />\nevening. The participants are<br />\nthen free to go home early<br />\nSaturday night. To complete<br />\nthe tests, the subjects must also<br />\ngive \"return samples.\" They<br />\nmust come back to the facility<br />\nthe following Sunday and Monday for just a few minutes. In<br />\nthis way, Pharmakinetics can<br />\nmeasure the rate at which the<br />\nmedicine disappears from the<br />\nbloodstream. An interim<br />\nperiod, during which the subjects are under no obligation,<br />\nthen elapses, usually lasting one<br />\nto two weeks. The overnight<br />\nstay and return samples are<br />\nthen repeated, with the second<br />\nmedicine used in place of the<br />\nfirst.<br />\nIn general, about fifteen<br />\nsamples are taken, usually<br />\namounting to about a pint. On<br />\nthe day of the last return sample, the subjects receive the<br />\nbulk of their payment. In addition, a monetary bonus is given<br />\nto those who have been on time<br />\nfor all dosages and return<br />\nsamples. Bonuses are also given<br />\nto exceptionally cooperative<br />\ngroups or individuals.<br />\nAll in all, the program is a<br />\ngreat way to earn decent money<br />\nwith little personal bother.<br />\nPunctuality is the main concern, though some of you Hutdwellers may have problems<br />\nwith your No-Doze, and you of<br />\nthe particularly boisterous frats<br />\nmay have difficulties with the<br />\ntemperance required. The<br />\nPharmakinetics program isn't<br />\nthe Gilman Coffee Shop or the<br />\nUnion Desk (in fact, at times<br />\nyou may feel like one of those<br />\nlittle white furry things that inhabit the basement of Ames)<br />\nbut for excitement and profit<br />\nit's hard to beat.

Surprisingly, only 10 total innings<br />\nwere played during the day,<br />\nwith both contests stopped and<br />\nvictory awarded to the Jays<br />\nbecause of the 10-run rule,<br />\nwhich states that if a team is<br />\nahead by 10 or more runs after<br />\n5 full innings of play [usually in<br />\na game of a doubleheader] the<br />\ncontest is over. Blue Jays<br />\nCoach Bobby Babb was happy<br />\nto get the wins but would rather<br />\nhave gotten more game experience. \"The weather [last<br />\nweek] got us off to a slow start.<br />\nWe've only been able to practice 3 or 4 times outside on our<br />\nfield, and to have the games<br />\nshortened today, well, it's one<br />\ntime that I didn't favor the 10run rule.\"<br />\nIt's a good thing for the<br />\nvisiting Bears that the 10-run<br />\nrule was in effect, or the teams<br />\nwould probably still be out<br />\nthere playing. Morgan State<br />\nwas simply no match for the<br />\nveteran Blue Jays, who managed to collect 22 runs on 12<br />\nhits. To put it simply, the Jays<br />\nhardly resembled a team that<br />\nhad only been outside 3 times.<br />\nEven if Morgan State wasn't so<br />\nbad (1 unearned run on 4 hits)<br />\nthey still would have been hard<br />\n<br />\npressed to make a game of it.<br />\nThat's how good the Jays were<br />\nTuesday.<br />\nIn the first game, Senior CoCaptain Mark Campbell shut<br />\ndown Morgan 1-2-3 in the top<br />\nof the 1st, setting the stage for<br />\nthe Jays' offensive onslaught.<br />\nSophomore Tom Finegan got<br />\nthings rolling with a single to<br />\nright, then promptly stole second.

Hopkins<br />\nwas quick to respond, and less<br />\nthan a minute later Bill Marquardt, assisted by Dave<br />\nHayward and Ed Giobbe, put<br />\nthe puck in the net for the Jays.<br />\nAgain less than a minute later,<br />\nMarquardt hit again, this time<br />\nassisted by Christ Verica. The<br />\nperiod ended with the Jays on<br />\ntop 2-1.<br />\nThe Jays continued to<br />\ndominate in the second period,<br />\nwith goals by Nils Youngwall<br />\n(assisted by Pat Gibbons) and<br />\n<br />\nGibbons (assisted by Mike<br />\nEhrlich). However, the all important M Factor, momentum,<br />\nseemed to shift to the Green<br />\nTerrors half way through the<br />\nsecond period, as they went on<br />\nto score three unanswered goals<br />\n(two in the third period, one<br />\nmore in the third) to tie the<br />\ngame at four apiece.<br />\nThe Blue Jays were able to<br />\nrespond after nearly a twenty<br />\nminute dry spell with a goal by<br />\nJamie Herring, assisted by CoCaptain Andy Gray. Herring<br />\ngot his second goal of the evening during the same shift, just<br />\nthirty-three seconds after his<br />\nfirst goal (assisted by CoCaptains Bill Dwyer and Andy<br />\nGray). Bill Marquardt completed his hat trick on an<br />\nunassisted goal. Chris Verica,<br />\nassisted by Nils Youngwall,<br />\nscored the Jays' eighth goal,<br />\nand Gil Burnett, assisted by<br />\nGibbons and Giobbe, tallied<br />\nHopkins' ninth goal. Western<br />\nMaryland was able to score<br />\nonce more, but it never appeared that they would threaten<br />\na comeback, as Burnett scored<br />\nthe final goal of the game on<br />\nassists by Youngwall and<br />\nGibbons.<br />\nThe hockey team's outlook<br />\n<br />\nfor next year's season is very<br />\npositive. Four seniors will be<br />\ngone (including co-founder and<br />\nCo-Captain Dwyer and Dave<br />\nHayward, second in team point<br />\ntotals), but many important<br />\nplayers will be returning, including defensive standouts<br />\nGiobbe and Youngwall, as well<br />\nas sophomore goalie Tom<br />\nMangiacapre. An important<br />\npart of next year's team will be<br />\nthis year's freshmen, whieh includes this season's points total<br />\nleader, Pat Gibbons.<br />\nNext year's season looks to<br />\nbe full, with more games at the<br />\nCivic Center. Further, there is<br />\na strong possibility that the<br />\nteam may join in a league with<br />\nWestern Maryland, Gettysburg, Franklin and Marshall, Navy J.V., and<br />\nDickinson.<br />\n<br />\nJOHNS HOPKINS HOCKEY 1985-86<br />\nPoint Totals<br />\nName<br />\nPat Gibbons<br />\nDave Hayward<br />\nGil Burnett<br />\nChris Verica<br />\nNils Youngwall<br />\nMarc Koren<br />\nJohn Caine<br />\nBill Marquerdt<br />\nBill Dwyer<br />\nMyron Barlow<br />\nEd Giobbe<br />\nAndy Gray<br />\nJamie Herring<br />\nEd Coffey<br />\nJack Crawford<br />\nMike Ehrlich<br />\nMike Schessel<br />\nTom Mangiacaprc<br />\n<br />\nGoals<br />\n6<br />\n5<br />\n4<br />\n3<br />\n3<br />\n2<br />\n4<br />\n3<br />\n0<br />\n2<br />\n1<br />\n0<br />\n2<br />\n2<br />\n0<br />\n0<br />\n0<br />\n0<br />\n<br />\nTotal Pts.<br />\n11<br />\n9<br />\n8<br />\n6<br />\n6<br />\n5<br />\n5<br />\n4<br />\n4<br />\n3<br />\n3<br />\n3<br />\n2<br />\n2<br />\n1<br />\n1<br />\n1<br />\n1<br />\n<br />\nAssists<br />\n5<br />\n4<br />\n4<br />\n3<br />\n3<br />\n3<br />\n0<br />\n1<br />\n4<br />\n1<br />\n2<br />\n3<br />\n0<br />\n0<br />\n1<br />\n1<br />\n1<br />\n1<br />\n<br />\n-7=<br />\n<br />\nF-F-F-F-F-F-Fencers<br />\nby Mel Tillis<br />\nSenior Andy Goldberg has<br />\nqualified for the fencing<br />\nNCAA's for the third year in a<br />\nrow. Goldberg is the first fencer<br />\nat Hopkins to ever attend the<br />\nNCAA's more than twice and<br />\nonly the third in conference<br />\nhistory ever to do so.<br />\nFencers qualify for the<br />\nNCAA's based on their team<br />\nrecord and placement in the<br />\nconference championships. In<br />\norder to qualify for the<br />\nNCAA's, Goldberg had to<br />\ncompete with fencers from<br />\nNYU, University of Pennsylvania, Duke, North Carolina,<br />\nand other top eastern universities for the 18 foil spots<br />\nallocated to the eastern schools.<br />\nBecause of his 61-6 record, the<br />\nfact that he won the individual<br />\nfoil title at the MAC's and<br />\nbecause he has already fenced<br />\nat the NCAA's twice, Goldberg<br />\nhad no problem qualifying for<br />\nthis year's NCAA championships.<br />\nIn his four years at Hopkins,<br />\nGoldberg has distinguished<br />\nhimself as a top fencer. As a<br />\nfreshman he won the under-19<br />\nSectionals and took 5th place at<br />\nthe MAC's. In the next three<br />\nyears he won the individual<br />\nMAC foil title three times, led<br />\nthe foil team to MAC team<br />\ntrophies twice, and won the<br />\nMaryland State Championships. Meanwhile, Goldberg<br />\ncompiled an unbelievable fouryear record of 201 wins and less<br />\nthan 25 losses!!<br />\nAccording to coach Dick<br />\nOles, \"He'll be fencing against<br />\nthe top 30 foilsmen in the country and he may make it to the<br />\nthird round [of four].\"<br />\n\"At the USFA Collegiate<br />\nOpen, Andy fenced against<br />\nmost of the same guys that will<br />\n<br />\n_<br />\n11111111111<br />\n_<br />\n<br />\nCOLLEGE<br />\nFENCING<br />\nREVIEW<br />\n<br />\nLay itontheline.<br />\n<br />\nFew fans are aware of Al's fencing<br />\nprowess in his (hos al Marquefie<br />\n<br />\nbe at the NCAA's and he took<br />\nsixth place.

Out of 18<br />\nsabre spots available, Shao was<br />\n18th. At the MAC Championships, Shao led his sabre team<br />\nto win the sabre team trophy<br />\nand he, himself, won the individual sabre title. According<br />\nto Oles, \"He'll probably get<br />\npast the first round [and] he<br />\nmay even make it to the third.\"<br />\nAnother Jayster, senior Alex<br />\nMoen, is first alternate in epee.<br />\nHe will go only if another<br />\nepeeman decides not to attend,<br />\nwhich he won't know until the<br />\nday of the tournament.<br />\n\"This just shows that we're<br />\ngetting better and better,\" since<br />\nso many JHU fencers qualified.<br />\n\"We're competing against buying schools [those that recruit<br />\nand give scholarships].

Coach Goodyear is also<br />\ngoing to try to make some<br />\nstructural changes in next year's<br />\nseason. This will include a more<br />\norganized intersession practice<br />\nschedule and incorporating<br />\nmore competition with club<br />\n<br />\nplayer's from the Baltimore<br />\narea and more scrimmages with<br />\nother nearby colleges.

More and more people<br />\nare beginning to see that there<br />\nis more to sexism than we've<br />\nalready discovered ...I'm here<br />\ntoday to help convey what men<br />\nare up against.\"<br />\nHe continued, \"We're not<br />\nsaying sexism is something that<br />\nonly hurts men.

The original<br />\nmeaning of feminism was a<br />\nmovement which strove for<br />\nequal rights between the sexes.<br />\nHowever, there are many people today who think that<br />\nfeminism means more rights for<br />\nwomen.\"<br />\nKammer began by showing<br />\nslides with a diagram of man's<br />\ncontrol of the dollar sign, which<br />\nhe said stood for \"political and<br />\neconomic power.\" In another<br />\ndiagram, women were related<br />\nto the dollar signs only through<br />\nthe men. \"This hurts the whole<br />\nsystem,\" Kammer said. He<br />\nremarked that man's abuse of<br />\nthis power does not make \"men<br />\ntherefore bad. Men are<br />\nhuman. . .

Nobody has really provided<br />\nspecifics; they ought to.<br />\nThe lack of clear reasons for increasing tuition is admittedly partly due to the<br />\nunusual way in which the figure came to<br />\nlight. Traditionally, the president has announced tuition increases at a special<br />\nmeeting of the Student Council, fielding<br />\nquestions right then and there. This year,<br />\nhowever, Muller told the News-Letter of<br />\nthe $800 hike in an interview.(Last year<br />\nas well, by the way, he broke tradition<br />\nby letting then Student Council President<br />\nJon Lana announce the increase prior to<br />\nMuller's presentation at the council.)<br />\nWe're by no means objecting to the<br />\nscoop this year, and it'll be just fine with<br />\nus if Muller makes announcing tuition<br />\nincreases to the News-Letter a new tradition. But having done so, he should still<br />\ngo to a council meeting.<br />\nAdmittedly, he will no longer be able<br />\nto announce the increase to a bunch of<br />\npeople who have no idea what it is, but<br />\nhe can still field questions from students<br />\nwho no doubt feel they haven't been<br />\ngiven a fair crack at the president of the<br />\nuniversity. We don't know if Student<br />\nCouncil President Paul Kadri has worked on getting Muller to a meeting, but<br />\nthat isn't really the point. If he hasn't,<br />\nhe should. If he doesn't. Muller should<br /><br />\ncontact Kadri and request an opportunity to address the council. The simple<br />\npoint is: Muller should definitely attend<br />\na meeting.<br />\nAnd while we're at it, let us make two<br />\nsuggestions to Muller on what to do at<br />\nthat meeting:<br />\neStay the entire time. Two years ago,<br />\nhe had the audacity to get up and walk<br />\nout after only an hour, even though there<br />\nwere still students who wanted to ask<br />\nquestion. Apparently, Muller was tired<br />\nor bored or something, so he left. It's<br />\ntrue that most students were saying<br />\nroughly the same thing, but an elementary sense of courtesy would dictate that<br />\nwhen you are telling people they have to<br />\npay another $800 to undergo the<br />\npleasures of term papers you could at<br />\nleast stick around until they've said what<br />\nthey want to.<br />\n\u2022Leave the list of 55 other schools' tuition levels at home. Every year, Muller<br />\npoints out that Hopkins ranks relatively<br />\nlow on the list, which lends an absurd air<br />\nof competition to the whole thing\u2014<br />\nalmost as if Hopkins wouldn't mind<br />\nmoving up a few notches. Nobody wants<br />\nto have a tax increase justified by<br />\nreferences to the far higher taxes they<br />\nhave to pay in Sweden.<br />\nWe're not saying the $800 increase<br />\nisn't justified; we are saying it needs further justification. By going before the<br />\ncouncil, Muller can provide some of<br />\nthat.<br /><br />\nBomb Threats<br />\nWriting about bomb threats is a little<br />\nlike writing about genocide: it's hard to<br />\nimagine two sides.<br />\nIt's obvious that this is simply one of<br />\nthe most obnoxious things to happen to<br />\nthe campus in years. Without accomplishing anything, it upsets the life<br />\nof every student. As the semester has<br />\nprogressed and work loads have increased, the situation has become even worse.<br />\nOften students simply must be in the<br />\nlibrary on a certain night. If research for<br />\na paper must be done, for example, the<br />\nlibrary is usually the only option.<br />\nFurthermore, the threats seem to have<br />\nno purpose. Normally one expects such<br />\nthings to be some kind of political statement. At least that's the way it's usually<br />\ndone in Beirut. But so far nobody has<br />\ncalled from the Hopkins chapter of<br />\nIslamic Jihad or the IRA or League for<br />\nthe Liberation of Librarians or some<br />\nother strange group to claim<br />\nresponsibility.<br />\nThese threats appear to be nothing<br />\nmore than mindless nuisances. Worst of<br />\nall, our guess\u2014for a couple of<br />\nreasons\u2014is that a student is behind the<br />\nwhole thing. First, nobody else would<br />\nthink to do such a thing for no apparent<br />\nreason, nor would someone else focus on<br />\nthe library. (They'd be more likely, it<br />\nseems to us, to try, say, Garland Hall.)<br />\nSecond, the security office has said it<br /><br />\nbelieves the calls are coming from an oncampus phone.<br />\nWhy would a student do something<br />\nlike this? Some people have suggested<br />\nthat it could be a pledge task for a fraternity, although that strikes us a bit outlandish. Surely no frat would try something<br />\nso risky, something which could easily<br />\nresult in the demise of the organization.<br />\nInstead, we tend to believe some slimy<br />\nlittle guy who thinks the whole thing is<br />\nFunny is the culprit.<br />\nThe big question, though, remains<br />\nlargely unaddressed: when should we<br />\nsimply ignore the threats and keep the<br />\nlibrary open? It is by no means an easy<br />\nproblem. Taking a risk (no matter how<br />\nslight) with people's lives is a serious<br />\ndecision. Still, we can't simply go on<br />\nevacuating the library forever. If, for example, a threat was received every night<br />\nfor the next year, one supposes that at<br />\nsome point the powers that be would<br />\nstop closing the library. (This isn't unprecedented; one of our editors was once<br />\nat a basketball game where a bomb<br />\nthreat was received, whereupon an announcement was made to the effect that<br />\nif you wanted to leave you could, but<br />\nthat play would continue.)<br />\nWe don't envy whoever ends up making the decision about keeping the library<br />\nopen. It will be a tough call, but it is one<br />\nwhich, eventually, will have to be made.<br /><br />\nHopkins students are the victims of a student government<br />\nsystem that does not work. It is<br />\nrun by people who truly don't<br />\ncare about the welfare of<br />\nstudents at this university. It is<br />\na home of nepotism on a grand<br />\nscale, and as an official body,<br />\nit is both ineffectual, and deaf<br />\nto the needs of students. Too<br />\noften it is just a rubber stamp<br />\nthat endorses the policies of the<br />\n\"professional\" staff members<br />\nof the school, without regard to<br /><br />\ntion of ideas. Too often, people who are touted as having experience merely have a long<br />\nhistory of incompetence.<br />\nThe Student Council is a<br />\nbody that has a record of not<br />\nsignificantly improving the life<br />\nof students. All recent improvements have basically been<br />\nthe contribution of the university. It is absurd that some<br />\nmembers of the student government claim responsibility for<br />\nthe increasing level of security<br /><br />\njoe chen<br />\nthe people who have to live with<br />\ntheir decisions. Furthermore, it<br />\nhas done more to abet than to<br />\nstop the rampant phenomena<br />\nof student apathy.<br />\nIt seems too often that the<br />\npeople who have sought office<br />\nin student government have used the office for personal ends<br />\nrather than to help students.<br />\nSadly enough, many members<br />\nhave simply regarded the office<br />\nas a wedge to go to professional<br />\nschools rather than as a means<br />\nof aiding the student welfare.<br />\nA cursory look over the candidates' statements for Young<br />\nTrustee, as well as recent issues<br />\nof the News-Letter, reveal that<br />\nmost committee memberships<br />\nand chairmanships have been<br />\ngiven to a mere handful of people. It indeed is worrisome<br />\nwhen we find that one person<br />\nmay have held five different<br />\ncommittee memberships at<br />\nHopkins, while the average student has held none, and indeed<br />\nhas little if any say in how<br />\nthings should be run. This leads<br />\nto an unhealthy degree of<br />\nhomogeneity, and to a stagna-<br /><br />\non campus. Clearly, the council did little in the affair, in<br />\nwhich the university had no<br />\nchoice but to improve security<br />\nor risk the reputation of the institution as a whole.<br />\nAdmittedly, the Rotunda<br />\nand White Marsh shuttles were<br />\nthe creations of the council, but<br />\nthey are grotesque examples of<br />\nthe mismanagement that exists<br />\nin the council. Each week, the<br />\nRotunda shuttle makes its<br />\nround trip dangerously<br />\noverloaded with students and<br />\ntheir groceries.<br />\nThe WJHU and Hut affairs<br />\nshow how out of touch the<br />\ncouncil really is with student<br />\nconcerns. While the student-run<br />\nradio station was being usurped<br />\nby the university, the student<br />\ngovernment sat idly by. Radio<br />\nstation staffers had to carry out<br />\nthe fight to retain control by<br />\nthemselves. The committee<br />\nwhich was recently formed by<br />\nthe council is a gesture, which<br />\nis too little, too late.

Part of this program<br />\nwas a panel discussion, to be<br />\nmediated by [Assistant Professor of Political Science<br />\nSteven] David, about the film's<br />\nmajor themes. The purpose of<br />\nthis program was not only to inform and educate the JHU student on the plight of the<br />\nPalestinians, but also to foster<br />\na discussion which would allow<br />\ndifferent viewpoints to present<br />\ntheir cases. In other words, the<br />\nMESA wanted student interaction on a very interesting and<br />\ncontroversial subject. The<br />\nMESA contacted the Jewish<br />\nStudents' Association, of which<br />\nDranikoff is a member, in the<br />\nhope of making this a joint effort. After some deliberation<br />\nwithin the JSA, the president<br />\nphoned me and agreed to take<br />\npart in this panel discussion.<br />\nThree days later, we received a<br />\nletter declining the invitation.<br />\nWhen I asked certain members<br />\n).<br /><br />\nI<br /><br />\nv'<br /><br />\n1,I\u2022<br /><br />\nof the JSA why they had changed their minds, they claimed<br />\nthat the film we were planning<br />\nto show was propaganda. Consequently, these certain<br />\nmembers said they were not interested in seeing the film and<br />\nwould not even show up.<br />\nFirst, the very fact that the<br />\nletter was sent by the Ad Hoc<br />\nCommittee for Peace Not Propaganda insinuated that we<br />\nwere interested in propaganda<br />\nand not peace. In fact, their<br />\nnew committee was formed<br />\nafter we invited them to participate in our program. Not<br />\nonly do I find formation of<br />\nsuch a committee hypocritical<br />\non their part, but their committee also fails to realize, again,<br />\nthe purpose of the film. The<br />\npurpose of the film was to promote disussion on an important<br />\nissue. . . .Second, I<br />\nwas<br />\nsomewhat confused<br />\nby<br />\nDranikoff's statement that we<br />\nhad to solve \"problems facing<br />\nour two groups.\" What problems? If he means groups as in<br />\nclubs, then the MESA doesn't<br />\nhave any problems with any<br />\nclubs. In fact, this it the first<br />\nmajor event that we have sponsored and our first contact with<br />\nthe JSA. Third, my feelings are<br />\nhurt by the statement: \"We<br />\nwelcome our Arab brothers into our committee...\" How<br />\nabout me and the other nonArab members? Are we invited? (Just joking.) My basic<br />\npoint is that the MESA is not<br />\ncomprised of all Arab<br />\nmembers, but in fact most of<br />\nour members are non-Arab.<br />\nI would like to address the<br />\nAd Hoc Committee for Peace<br />\nNot Propaganda's invitation<br />\nfor a private discussion. The<br />\nMESA gladly accepts this invitation, although this meeting<br />\nwill not achieve our initial objective of presenting various<br />\nviewpoints about the Palestinian plight to the J HU student<br />\nbody.<br />\nErik C'.

Seeing the<br />\nskeleton of the show during<br />\nrehearsals, I came expecting to<br />\nbe entertained, and I wasn't<br />\ndisappointed.<br />\nEntertainment is the key<br />\nword for the show, with juggling, dancing, roller skating,<br />\nand a \"rapping\" parable; audience interaction is a large part<br />\nof that entertainment\u2014passing<br />\nfootballs into the audience after<br />\na scrimmage onstage, giving<br />\naway balloons, Judas Iscariot<br />\nplaying Monty Hall and handing out money, and Tara\u2014<br />\nwell, you'll have to find out<br />\nabout Tara for yourself, all<br />\ngave the show a personal informality lacking in other adaptations I have seen.<br />\nThe entertainment was also a<br />\nproblem for me in a few<br />\ncases\u2014however,1 don't want to<br />\nsound like the Emperor in<br /><br />\nAmadeus, but maybe there's<br />\nonly so much comedy the senses<br />\ncan take in one play.

The use of a jungle gym<br />\ninstead of the standard chainlink fence was particularly effective.

This is not to say that<br />\nCrossroads operates on the<br />\nsame level of banality as that<br />\nshow, but it does prove that the<br />\nFaustus myth is alive and well<br />\nin the 1980's.<br /><br />\nWhen it comes- to the Blues,<br />\nwhich this movie is about,<br />\nthoroughly, the Faustus myth<br />\nworks particularly well\u2014<br />\nRobert Johnson, after all, sold<br />\nhis soul and became a virtual<br />\nBlues god, if you believe the<br />\nlegend. The Blues and the Devil<br />\nare a natural match; that is one<br />\nof the reasons this movie works<br />\nand one of the reasons it<br />\ndoesn't.<br />\nThe movie centers around<br />\nRalph Macchio, as a Juilliardschooled guitarist and selfstyled \"Lightnin' Boy,\" and<br />\nJoe Seneca, as Blues-legend<br />\n\"Blind Willie Brown.\" Willie,<br />\nit seems, knows Robert<br />\nJohnson's last unrecorded song<br />\nand the kid (name's Eugene)<br />\nthinks it'll give him the notice<br />\nhe needs to become a headlining Blues act. To get the<br />\nsong, though, Eugene must<br />\ntake Willie back home to<br />\nMississippi delta country\u2014<br />\nRobert Johnson country\u2014<br />\nwhere it just so happens Willie<br />\nalso sold his soul. Thus the<br />\nmovie: really a road film\u2014an<br />\naccount of their travels to<br />\nMississippi, the teenage<br />\nrunaway they meet along the<br />\nway(Jami Gertz), and the kid's<br />\ndevelopment from a Long<br />\nIsland boy to a Blues man. It is<br />\nthe Blues, though, that really<br />\ncarries this film, the Ry Cooder<br />\nsoundtrack running the gamut<br />\nfrom country blues to single<br /><br />\nstring B.B. King stuff.<br />\nThe movie is all very pleasant, well-paced, and actually<br />\none of the best natured movies<br />\nyou're bound to see but has few<br />\nmoments of any real emotional<br />\ndepth. Ralph Macchio makes a<br />\nlikeable, idealistic, Bluesworshipping kid, and Joe<br />\nSeneca, as the black whitehaired Blues giant is also very<br />\ncharming, but it's all too antiseptic; the two make a cute<br />\nand often touching pair, a<br />\nwhite kid and an elderly black<br />\nman, but it's a very slick<br />\nHollywood bond (not really the<br />\nBlues) that holds them together.<br />\nThis is ironic of course, since<br />\nthe movie says convincingly<br />\nthat the Blues can't be antiseptic by its very nature, but I<br />\ncould go on and on about<br />\nvalidity and that wouldn't<br />\nchange the fact that it's stupid<br />\nto think Hollywood would ever<br />\nrelease a film rough enough to<br />\ndo justice to the subject.<br />\nThat is not to say that this<br />\nfilm is uninteresting, it is in its<br />\nsimple and rather obvious way.<br />\nIn\" fact, the climactic conflict<br />\nfor the soul of Willie between<br />\nthe \"Lightnin' Boy\" and a<br />\nmenacing heavy metal blues<br />\nguitarist whose soul has been<br />\nlost for good, is an original and<br />\neffective twist on the Rockytype ending. So the Devil theme<br />\nworks in giving this film a really neat(though joltingly out ot<br /><br />\nplace in its unreality) ending<br />\nand fails in that there is no real<br />\nevil anywhere in the movie\u2014<br />\nthe only \"bad\" guy in the<br />\nmovie is a comically blatant<br />\nracist who soon gets what's<br />\ncoming to him anyway.<br />\nNevertheless, any film that<br />\neven does lip service to the likes<br />\nof Robert Johnson and Son<br />\nHouse, is all right in my book.<br />\nThere hasn't been a major motion picture like this since The<br />\nBlues Brothers and even that<br />\nmovie emphasized the R&amp;B side<br />\nof things instead of the rootsy<br />\ndelta Blues of Crossroads.

It has been<br />\nmore than a year since his<br />\nprevious novel, The Aquitaine<br />\nProgression, disappointed both<br />\nreaders and critics, causing many<br />\nto wonder if Ludlum had gone<br />\nstale, lost his touch. Any such<br />\nfears should be alleviated by The<br />\nBourne Supremacy. This newest<br />\nbook, his thirteenth to date, is a<br />\ngripping, well-crafted thriller in<br />\nthe finest Ludlum tradition.<br />\nLudlum's first sequel continues the chilling saga of Jason<br />\nBourne. In Ludlum's earlier<br />\nbestseller, The Bourne Identity,<br />\nwe were introduced to Jason<br />\nBourne, the world's premier<br />\nassassin-for-hire. Over the course<br />\nof the novel, Bourne hunted<br />\nCarlos, a rival assassin,<br />\nthroughout Europe, and began<br />\nto rediscover his true identity as<br />\nDavid Webb.<br />\nThe Bourne Supremacy<br />\nresumes the story with David<br />\nWebb recovering peacefully<br />\nwith his new wife in a small college town in Maine. His tranquil life is soon shattered,<br />\nhowever. Government authorities decide they need his<br />\nskills, his expertise, once again.<br />\nAn impostor is loose in Asia. A<br />\nnew killer, using Jason<br />\nBourne's name and reputation,<br />\nthreatens to disrupt the delicate<br />\nbalance of power and trade in<br />\nChina if he is not stopped.<br /><br />\nAt the highest levels of U.S.<br />\nGovernment a decision is made.<br />\nDavid Webb must return to<br />\nAsia, and must unmask the impostor and his mysterious<br />\nclient. To accomplish this,<br />\nWebb's wife Marie is kidnapped, and a trail left for him to<br />\nfollow into Asia. As he chases<br />\nacross the world, Webb realizes<br />\nthat in order to succeed in his<br />\nmission and find his wife, he<br />\nmust use that part of himself he<br />\nmost fears. He must return to<br />\nbeing Jason Bourne.<br />\nThus Ludlum sets the stage<br />\nfor one of the most exciting and<br />\nbelievable novels as Bourne<br />\nraces through Asia, following<br />\ncountless twists, and uncovering deadly deceptions and<br />\nbetrayals.<br />\nIn many ways, The Bourne<br />\nSupremacy is Robert Ludlum's<br />\nbest work ever. This is largely<br />\ndue to his skillful development<br />\nof his characters. Ludlum produces a very complete picture<br />\nof David Webb, frantic as he<br />\nsearches for his wife. He must<br />\ncombat hostile forces all<br />\naround him, while compromising with his own alternate identity of Jason Bourne\u2014the<br />\nmaster assassin. This battle<br />\nagainst both unseen and internal enemies heightens the effect<br />\nof an already intricate plot, and<br />\nmakes Webb's task even more<br />\ndifficult. Slowly we see Webb<br />\ngrow more and more reliant<br />\nupon the deadly talents of<br />\nJason Bourne, and he comes to<br />\naccept the value of both parts<br />\nof himself. It is here that<br />\nLudlum displays his skill,<br />\nshowing the conflict between<br />\nWebb and Bourne admirably,<br />\nand without confusing the<br /><br />\nreader.<br />\nThe scene early in the book,<br />\nwhen he discovers his wife has<br />\nbeen kidnapped, demonstrates<br />\nthe smoothness of his switches<br />\nfrom one personality to<br />\nanother, and sets the tone of<br />\nhe novel:<br />\nWebb screamed, falling<br />\nonto the pillows, trying to<br />\nmute the outrage and the<br />\nhorror that came from his<br />\nthroat, pushing back the<br />\npain that swept through<br />\nhis temples.

Inside were two<br />\nautomadismantled<br />\ntics...<br />\nA man often at war with<br />\nhimself, Webb/Bourne is much<br />\nmore human than many of<br />\nLudlum's previous characters.<br />\nWebb is often horrified at the<br />\natrocities Jason Bourne commits, yet he knows they must be<br />\ncommitted if he is to find his<br />\nwife again. This makes it much<br />\neasier to identify with him than<br />\nwith some of Ludlum's superspies, who usually display little<br />\ncompassion or sympathy for<br />\nanyone else. In this way<br />\nLudlum has improved his<br />\ncharacter development, and<br />\ncreated a hero, who, although<br /><br />\ndir<br />\nRobert Ludlum\u2014Author of The<br />\nvo?<br />\nBourne Supremacy<br /><br />\nsomewhat less than perfect, is<br />\nexceedingly believable.<br />\nAt the same time, the governwho<br />\nauthorities<br />\nment<br />\nmanipulate David Webb are<br />\nalso genuine characters. Unlike<br />\nthose in several previous<br />\nLudlum novels\u2014in which<br />\npowerful were at worst<br />\n\"maniacs\", and at best<br />\nincompetent\u2014the government<br />\nfigures in The Bourne<br />\nSupremacy are fleshed out a little. They are shown as torn between their duty to prevent<br />\nchaos and bloodshed in the Far<br />\nEast, and the guilt they feel for<br />\nmanipulating Webb and his<br />\nwife, subjecting them both to<br />\nunimaginable horrors and terrifying risks.<br />\nAn interesting parallel is<br />\ndrawn between Webb, committing violence he abhors in order<br />\nto find his wife, and McAllister,<br />\nthe undersecretary of state, who<br />\nrisks the lives of an innocent<br /><br />\ncouple to prevent even more<br />\nkillings. The comparison between these two men gives insights into motivations beyond<br />\nthe scope of the novel.<br />\nFinally, Ludlum has expanded the character of Marie,<br />\nDavid's wife. Although we only see one side of her personality, she does in many respects<br />\nrepresent the focus of the book.<br />\nIn that respect, Ludlum has improved upon his usual heroine,<br />\nwho in earlier works was often<br />\nsimply a background figure.<br />\nIn short, with The Bourne<br />\nSupremacy, Robert Ludlum<br />\nhas managed to expand<br />\ncharacter development, while<br />\npreserving the fast-paced,<br />\ntightly-woven, twisting plot<br />\nthat his followers have come to<br />\nexpect.

A little-known drug<br />\njust ten years ago, PCP is<br />\nbecoming the drug of choice in<br />\nD.C. and other metropolitan<br />\nareas. The great concern of<br />\npolice officials, mental health<br />\nworkers, teachers, and the<br />\nmedical community is not unfounded. According to James<br />\nHendricks, head of the PCP<br />\nTask Force in Prince George's<br />\nCounty, and regional director<br />\nof Second Genesis, a private<br />\ndrug treatment center,\"PCP is<br />\nthe most dangerous drug on the<br />\nmarket today.\" The increased<br />\nuse of the drug by teenagers<br />\nand even younger children is<br />\nalso a major reason for<br />\nconcern.<br />\nThe history of PCP use in<br />\nthis country is somewhat<br />\nuneven. In 1967, about two<br />\nyears after Parke-Davis discontinued clinical trials of the drug,<br />\nit emerged on the streets of<br />\nCalifornia under the name<br />\n\"PeaCe Pill.\" Although<br />\npsychedelic drugs were popular<br />\nat that time, the extreme<br />\nhallucinogenic effects of PCP<br />\nwere apparently found unpleasant, and it was rejected by the<br />\ndrug community. In 1%8,PCP<br />\nappeared in New York City<br />\nunder the name \"Hog\", but<br />\ndidn't catch on in popularity<br />\nthere, either. Soon after that,<br />\ndealers around the country<br />\nbegan selling PCP in disguise,<br />\nclaiming it was THC,<br />\nmescaline, LSD, or other<br />\ndesirable psychedelic drugs. In<br /><br />\nthen noticed in the newspaper of PCP in Baltimore City.<br />\nthat a major illicit PCP lab had There are still, however, quite<br />\nrecently been busted, just at the a few PCP users, especially in<br />\ntime that the adolescent the southwest part of Baltimore<br />\npsychosis dropped off.

The seizure was the<br />\ncases emerged. Now, however, largest of its kind in Baltimore's<br />\na resurgence of illicit produc- history. According to Utz,<br /><br />\n\"There's a complete removal with<br />\nPCP. . . . At least with marijuana,<br />\nyou're still in touch with your<br />\nsurroundings.\"<br />\ntion and use is occurring. Unlike<br />\nother drugs, though, PCP<br />\nmanufacture appears to be confined to a few \"hot spots\"<br />\naround the country. Los<br />\nAngeles seems to have the worst<br />\nproblem, followed closely by<br />\nthe \"Route 95 Corridor,\" the<br />\narea encompassing Washington<br />\nD.C., Prince George's County,<br />\nAnne Arundel County, Arlington, Virginia, and other areas<br />\nsouthwest of Baltimore. Other<br />\ncities, including Detroit and<br />\nChicago, are also seeing an increase in the problem.<br />\nPCP is sold under many<br />\nstreet names, including \"angel<br />\ndust,\" \"flakes,\" \"rocket<br />\nfuel,\" and \"killer weed.\" Marijuana sprayed with PCP is<br />\nknown as \"loveboat,\" or<br />\n\"lovely.\" A PCP-soaked marijuana cigarette is known as a<br />\n\"Sherman,\" and sells for<br />\n$40-$75 on the street. PCP is<br />\noften packaged in 35 mm film<br />\ncannisters, which sell in<br />\nBaltimore for $50 , and yield<br />\nbetween 5-6 cigarettes. It is also<br />\nsold in tin foil or vanilla bot-<br /><br />\n\"We see kids younger and younger<br />\ncoming in for treatment programs. . . and they're saying it's in<br />\nthe schools.\"<br />\nthe early 1970's many universities, including the University<br />\nof Maryland, began setting up<br />\ndrug analysis laboratories<br />\nwhich<br />\npublicized<br />\nthe<br />\nmisrepresentation that was occurring. After this, the sale of<br />\npsychedelic drugs declined, and<br />\nit appeared that the PCP problem was over. After a quiet<br />\nperiod of about four years,<br />\nhowever, PCP reemerged\u2014this<br />\ntime as the preferred drug in a<br />\nyounger population of abusers.<br />\nTwo high production areas appeared, one on the West Coast,<br />\nand the other in Washington<br />\nD.C. and its surrounding<br />\ncounties.<br />\nAround this time, Dr. Paul<br />\nLuisada, a psychiatrist<br />\nElizabeth's Hospital in<br />\nSoutheast Washington, noted a<br />\nrapid rise in adolescent<br />\npsychosis admissions, far above<br />\nbaseline levels. Then, just as<br />\nquickly as it fell rose, it fell off.<br />\nLuisada was puzzled at first, but<br /><br />\nties. Street prices tend to vary<br />\nin different areas.<br />\nAlthough the drug penalties<br />\nwere recently increased in<br />\nMaryland, possession of PCP is<br />\nstill considered a misdemeanor,<br />\nwith a maximum sentence of<br />\nfour years, and/or a $10,000<br />\nfine. Distribution of PCP<br />\nis a felony, and carries a<br />\nmaximum penalty of twenty<br />\nyears and/or a $25,000 fine.<br />\nDetective Melvin Utz, of the<br />\nBaltimore City Police Narcotics<br />\nUnit, feels that the penalties are<br />\nnot tough enough.<br />\nSo far, Baltimore City has<br />\nmanaged to stay clear of the<br />\nPCP epidemic. In 1981, Captain Joseph Newman, head of<br />\nthe drug enforcement unit of<br />\nthe Baltimore City Police<br />\nDepartment, tripled the<br />\nnumber of detectives in the<br />\nunit, putting special emphasis<br />\non cocaine, heroin and PCP.<br />\nAs far as Detective Utz knows,<br />\nthere are now no manufacturers<br /><br />\n4..sool.441641.4.4<br /><br />\nhowever, cocaine and heroin<br />\nare much more of a problem in<br />\nBaltimore City than is PCP.<br />\nIn Washington D.C., the<br />\nstory is quite different. There,<br />\nPCP is becoming the drug of<br />\nchoice. According to a<br />\nWashington Post article, while<br />\nthere were 310 arrests for PCP<br />\npossession or sale in 1981, the<br />\nnumber had increased to 3,030<br />\narrests by 1985. In contrast,<br />\nBaltimore police made only 226<br />\nPCP arrests in 1985. While the<br />\npopulation of D.C. is greater<br />\nthan that of Baltimore, the<br />\nnumber of PCP arrests there is<br />\nstill disproportionately high.<br />\nThe emergency room<br />\nstatistics in Prince George's<br />\nCounty are equally as alarming.<br />\nAccording to the county's PCP<br />\nTask Force report, of the 651<br />\ndrug patients admitted in 1984,<br />\n372 were PCP cases. In addition, 17 percent of the PCP patients at Second Genesis in<br />\nApril of last year were under<br />\nthe age of 21. According to<br />\nHendricks, \"We see kids<br />\nyounger and younger coming in<br />\nfor treatment programs...and<br />\nthey're saying it's in the<br />\nschools.\"<br />\nNobody seems to know why<br />\nthe PCP problem is so concentrated in certain areas and not<br />\nin others. Cocaine, heroin, and<br /><br />\nmost other illicit drugs are fairly evenly distributed around the<br />\ncountry. The disparity may be<br />\ndue, in part, to the quality of<br />\npolice enforcement in the<br />\nvarious areas. Another<br />\npossibility is cultural differences. The low price of PCP<br />\nrelative to that of other drugs<br />\nis attractive in areas with high<br />\npoverty levels. Poor teenagers<br />\nmake up a high percentage of<br />\nPCP users in D.C. and Los<br />\nAngeles. In addition, PCP<br />\nseems to be associated with a<br />\n\"macho\" image among<br />\nHispanic youths in Los Angeles<br />\nand unemployed blacks in<br />\n,Washington.<br />\nThere is not, however, a<br />\n\"typical\" PCP user. According<br />\nto Utz, \"We're talking about<br />\npeople from all walks of life.\"<br />\nOf the 57 patients at Second<br />\nGenesis last April, 29 were<br />\nwhite, and 28 black. The age of<br />\nusers ranges from young<br />\nchildren to adults in their 30's.<br />\nUsers are usually low to middle<br />\nin economic status, and men<br /><br />\ntend to outnumber women.<br />\nThe reasons for using PCP<br />\nmay differ as well. While some<br />\nsee it as a \"macho\" or \"cool\"<br />\nthing to do, others may use it<br />\nto separate themselves from<br />\ntheir problems. As with most<br />\ndrugs, PCP provides an escape<br />\nfrom reality. This effect with<br />\nPCP, however, is much more<br />\nextreme. Carol Palmer, a<br />\ncounselor at the Jones Falls<br />\nCommunity Corporation in<br />\nHampden, says, \"There's a<br />\nwith<br />\ncomplete removal<br />\nPCP...at least with marijuana, you're still in touch with<br />\nyour surroundings.\" According<br />\nto Melissa Lucas, also of Jones<br />\nFalls, \"The earmark of a PCP<br />\nuser would be someone who's<br />\nnot uncomfortable with a sense<br />\nof unreality.\" This \"unreality\"<br />\nis what makes PCP the most<br />\ndangerous drug on the streets<br />\ntoday. The \"escape\" it provides leads users to horrible acts<br />\nof violence, often with tragic<br />\nContinued on Page 17<br /><br />\nBaltimore City Police Dept.<br /><br />\nSome of the chemicals used in the manufacture of PCP.<br /><br />\nChallenges in Medical Education<br />\nby Meidee Goh<br />\nOn Tuesday, March 4, 1986,<br />\nthe last presentation in this<br />\nyear's William Henry Welch<br />\nLecture Series: The Culture of<br />\nMedicine, featured Dr. Richard<br />\nS. Ross, vice president for<br />\nmedicine at the Johns Hopkins<br />\nMedical School. He presented<br />\nhis views on medical education<br />\ntoday and in the future in a talk<br />\nentitled \"Challenges in Medical<br />\nEducation.\"<br />\nDr. Ross began by explaining<br />\nthe medical school selection<br />\nprocess in the U.S. and expressed<br />\nhis opinion on how this may<br />\nchange in the future. He<br />\nbelieves the studies which<br />\npredict an oversupply of doctors by the year 2000 and thinks<br />\nthat cut-backs in admissions<br />\nshould be made to maintain the<br />\nquality of doctors. At present,<br />\nthere are 16,000 spaces in<br /><br />\n01 46.4P<br />\n411vViV44111011,<br />\ncirApvio......,0~..:0101A4.'x4t10101,<br /><br />\nmedical schools in the U.S. and<br />\ntwice as many students. Those<br />\nwho do not enter U.S. medical<br />\nschools eventually find their<br />\nway to offshore medical<br />\nschools which provide education of questionable quality.<br />\nUsing the open admission,<br />\npolicies in Belgium and Italy as<br />\nan example, he noted that the<br />\ndoctor glut in these countries<br />\nhas had a negative effect on the<br />\nquality of medical service.<br />\nCases of unnecessary medication, testing, and perhaps<br />\nsurgery were noted. Due to the<br />\nshortage of legitimate jobs,<br />\nqualified physicians have had to<br />\nfind other occupations to support themselves since the laws<br />\nof supply and demand do not<br />\napply to medicine, active steps<br />\nshould be taken to maintain<br />\nquality, he said.<br />\nAt present U.S. medical<br />\nschools look for students with<br /><br />\nmain<br />\ntwo<br />\nattributes:<br />\nhumanitarianism and the ability to master the basic sciences.<br />\nDr. Ross felt that there tended<br />\nto be an overemphasis placed<br />\non competence in science. In an<br />\nattempt to de-emphasize this<br />\narea, Hopkins has decided to<br />\nmake the MCAT's optional.<br />\nThe judgment would then be<br />\nbased on grades, recommendations and personality. The test<br />\nseems merely to prepare the student for test taking and distorts<br />\nthe undergraduate experience.<br />\nHowever, this does not mean<br />\nthat medical schools would<br />\nlower their academic standards<br />\nto accept more humanitarians.<br />\nHumanitarianism and competence in science are not<br />\nmutually exclusive.<br />\nA high premium should be<br />\nput on the maturity of students.<br />\nContinued on Page 17<br /><br />\nMedical Education<br />\nContinued from Page 16<br /><br />\nThus, the Flex-med program at<br />\nHopkins was developed to<br />\nreplace early admission. This<br />\nprogram guarantees early admission with late matriculation.<br />\nStudents accepted through this<br />\nprogram during their junior<br />\nyear can finish their senior year<br />\nwithout the usual pressures.<br />\nThis would allow the student to<br />\naccept risks and challenges he<br />\nwould not have taken previously and enhance his senior year<br />\nexperience. A second option in<br />\nthe Flex-med program allows<br />\nstudents to spend a year at a<br />\nspecial study or work program<br />\nprior to matriculation. Adding<br />\ncharacter and maturity to the<br />\nstudent body provides a diversified class and increases the<br />\nlearning experience.<br />\nMedical schools train<br />\nstudents to serve society<br />\nthrough the use of biomedical<br />\nscience. The current curriculum<br />\nenough<br />\nprovides<br />\nnot<br />\nhumanities. There was a proposal to add courses in English,<br />\nhistory, and philosophy to a<br />\nmedical student's training.<br />\nHowever, Dr. Ross felt that<br />\nthere is already so much information to assimilate that<br />\nnothing more can be added due<br />\nto time constraints. The selectivity in the learning process is<br />\nnot being done very well;<br />\ncourses should concentrate on<br />\nthe principles of biomedical<br />\nscience rather than on the<br />\ndetails, Ross said. In the future,<br />\nthe use of computers to provide<br />\neasy access to information will<br />\nreduce the amount of information that students must commit<br />\nto memory. Hands on experience in the laboratory<br />\nshould be increased by cutting<br />\nback on lecture time by 25-50<br />\npercent. Lab study in gross<br />\nanatomy and physiology may<br />\nbe difficult to continue in the<br />\nfuture due to the sensitivity of<br />\nthe public to animal experimentation, cost, and lack of<br />\nfacilities. According to Ross,<br />\nlab exposure allows students to<br />\nsee if they like research and<br />\nwidens the experiences of the<br />\nstudents. He said the clinical<br />\ncurriculum should be guided by<br />\nthe needs of society rather than<br />\nthe interests of the professors.<br />\nThe pressures placed on the<br />\nmedical profession by society<br />\nhas altered the education of a<br />\nmedical student to a certain extent. Due to cost control, the<br />\nhospital stay of a patient today<br />\nhas been considerably reduced.<br />\nThis makes it impossible to<br />\ndevelop the patient-student<br />\nrelationship. According to<br /><br />\nRoss, there is no room for the<br />\nstudent in the system. Presently, the student-patient contact<br />\ncan only be developed in outpatient situations. However,<br />\nthis is not cost efficient since<br />\nthe qualified physicians on staff<br />\ncould be more productive<br />\nwithout the students. Thus<br />\nthese education programs have<br />\nto be subsidized.<br />\nThe changing trend in the<br />\npopulation distribution will affect the emphasis of certain<br />\ntopics in the curriculum. The<br />\nU.S. population in 1983 had<br />\nmore people 65 years or older<br />\nthan teenagers. Hence the problems of the elderly must be<br />\ndealt with by the students. This<br />\nhas led to a change in attitude<br />\ntoward geriatrics. No longer are<br />\nthe requirements only tender<br />\nloving care. The importance in<br />\nresearch on the diseases of the<br />\nelderly such as senile dimentia<br />\nhas increased within the last few<br />\nyears.<br />\nIn response to the subject of<br />\ncorporate medicine and Health<br />\nMaintainance Organizations<br />\n(HMOs), he felt that research<br />\nwould become a more popular<br />\ncareer choice. There will be few<br />\ndoctors in solo practice as the<br />\nHMOs and corporations hire<br />\nmore and more doctors. This<br />\nwould lead to competition,<br />\ndecrease in the cost of medicine<br />\nand thus a reduction in the<br />\nphysician's income.<br />\nThe present increasing trend<br />\nin the number of malpractice<br />\nsuits has led to the practice of<br />\n\"defensive medicine.\" Dr.<br />\nRoss said that many cases were<br />\ndue to \"bad luck\" rather than<br />\nany intentional abuse of the<br />\nsystem. The uncertainty in<br />\nmedicine will always be there<br />\ndue to the biological link. He<br />\nfeels that society has become<br />\nless tolerant of the fact that<br />\nmedicine is still not an exact<br />\nscience.<br />\nIn conclusion, Dr. Ross<br />\nstated that medicine is still a<br />\ngood career choice since it combines humanitarianism with<br />\ncompetence in science. Financial support for students will<br />\nprobably have to increase to<br />\ncope with the rising cost in<br />\nmedical education. His only<br />\nfear is the fact that students<br />\nmay enter a field based on<br />\neconomic needs rather than<br />\ninterest.<br />\nRoss received his MD from<br />\nHarvard Medical School.

In Prince<br />\nGeorge's County, officials are<br />\nspeaking in schools in order to<br />\neducate children and teenagers<br />\nabout the dangers of drugs such<br />\nas PCP. A drug analysis lab is<br />\ndue to be set up there, which<br />\nwill be used primarily for PCP<br />\ntesting.

Many of you<br />\nmay have heard a recent radio<br />\nannouncement from the Pharmakinetics Laboratory, calling<br />\nfor healthy males to participate<br />\nin a drug test. Undoubtedly, the<br />\nthing that caught your attention<br />\nwas the amount of money being offered to take part in the<br />\nprogram. As one of many<br />\nfinancially-struggling students<br />\ncaught in the grip of yet<br />\nanother tuition hike, I decided<br />\nthat an investigation couldn't<br />\nhurt.<br />\nAs the announcement stated,<br />\nhealthy, non-allergic, nondiseased males between the ages<br />\nof nineteen and fifty were needed. I seemed to fit these prerequisites, so I called the number<br />\nto set up a time for a free<br />\nphysical. A pleasant, cheerful<br />\nvoice warned me not to eat<br />\nanything, especially any caffeine products, for at least<br />\nseven hours before the physical.<br />\nI was also prohibited from taking any medication, including<br />\naspirin, for two weeks prior to<br />\nmy appointment. The time was<br />\nset at 8:00 a.m., on a Monday.<br />\nThe voice didn't seem to be so<br />\npleasant now. By the time it<br />\ntold me I also couldn't drink<br />\nany form of alcohol for at least<br />\nforty-eight hours before that<br />\nMonday (which meant a dry<br />\nweekend), the voice had<br />\nbecome downright obnoxious.<br />\n1 found myself wondering what<br />\nwould be harder to do<br />\nwithout\u2014tea or tequila.<br />\nAnyway, I suffered through<br />\nmy \"probationary\" period<br />\n(which, incidentally, was worse<br />\nthan being in Orgo lab, if you<br />\ncan believe that) and arrived at<br />\nPharmakinetics Inc. at the<br />\nspecified time. The facility is<br />\nlocated at 104 East 25th Street,<br />\na short seven blocks from campus. Pharmakinetics has been<br />\nin business for more than ten<br />\nyears, and more than eight<br />\nthousand men have taken part<br />\nin their vaious surveys. The offices were bright and colorful,<br />\nwith labworkers running busily up and down stairs. A few<br />\ndoctors walked purposefully<br />\nfrom room to room. I was<br />\ndirected to the receptionist by<br />\none of many enthusiastic<br />\nmonitors which kept the place<br />\nrunning smoothly. The medical<br />\ndirector, Melvin Sharoky,<br />\nM.D., came in every now and<br />\nthen as I filled out a detailed<br />\nfamily-health screening form.<br />\nA short blond woman named<br />\nAlicia then went over the form<br />\nwith me very carefully. She was<br />\nobviously well-trained and even<br />\nsqueezed a third-grade Little<br />\nLeague injury that I had<br />\nneglected to mention out of my<br />\nmemory. I then went into a<br />\ntypical-looking doctor's office<br />\nand was given a blood test, a<br />\nurine test, and a physical examination. After this, I was led<br />\nto a seminar room. I sat in with<br />\na group of other candidates and<br />\nwe listened to an information<br />\nsession given by yet another<br />\nassistant.<br />\nFirst of all, to those a little<br /><br />\nGanesh Ramachandran<br /><br />\nAaron 1)a is, a \"health) )oung male betN\u2018een the ages ()I' 19 and 50,\"<br />\ns\u2018ho is participating in the l'harmakineties studs.<br /><br />\nwary of being guinea pigs,<br />\nPharmakinetics, for the most<br />\npart, does not test the safety of<br />\nany drugs. The medicines which<br />\nare tested have all been in use<br />\nfor more than seventeen years.<br />\nThe company tests the diffusion rates of different varieties<br />\nof these medicines. As<br />\neverybody knows, certain<br />\nmedicines and foodstuffs come<br />\nin two different forms; brandname or \"labeled,\" and noname or generic. There is an<br />\nongoing debate within the pharmaceutical business as to<br />\nwhether the more expensive<br />\nbrand-name drugs are, in fact,<br />\nfaster or more effective than the<br />\ncheaper generic medicines.<br />\nPharmakinetics deals mainly<br />\nwith cold-remedies, high-blood<br />\npressure medicine, hyperactivity drugs and the like.(To those<br />\nseeking a cheap thrill, forget it.<br />\nThese are about as exciting as<br />\nan 8:00 a.m. lecture.) The<br />\ndosages, however, are very<br />\nsmall and will not affect a preexisting condition. Indeed, if<br />\nafter checking your blood and<br />\nyour chart, the very thorough<br />\nstaff at Pharmakinetics finds<br />\nthat any type of reaction is<br />\npossible you will not be allowed to participate.<br />\nBut you want to hear about<br />\nmoney, right? The payment for<br />\nparticipation depends upon the<br />\nduration of the study, with<br />\nsums ranging from 100 to over<br />\n1000 dollars. The testing procedure itself is rather<br />\nstraightforward and simple.<br />\nYou are given a dosage of a certain medicine A. A set amount<br />\nof time later, a blood or urine<br />\nsample is given. The amount of<br />\nmedicine in this sample is then<br />\ncompared with a \"clean\" sample taken earlier or on the day<br />\nof your physical. The procedure is then repeated some<br />\ntime later with medicine B, and<br />\nthe diffusion rates compared.<br />\nObviously, caffeine or alcohol<br />\ncan have a profound effect<br />\nupon these diffusion rates.<br />\nLikewise, digesting food may<br />\nabsorb the medicine or slow the<br />\ncirculation. Hence, it is very important to follow Pharmakinetics' regulations regarding these things.<br />\nThere are two basic types of<br />\nstudies done at the facility.<br />\n\"Check-in\" studies usually<br />\nconsist of visiting the office<br />\nevery other day for a week or<br />\nso and giving a sample. \"Overnights\" are the second type of<br />\nstudy, and are far more<br />\nlucrative. Overnights usually<br />\ntake place from Friday to<br />\nSaturday, although other nights<br />\nmay be specified. The participants report to the office at<br />\na certain time on Friday. They<br /><br />\nare then bussed to a downtown<br />\nhotel, and given a room to<br />\nshare. After arriving, the subjects change to hospital scrubs<br />\nand T-shirts. Dinner is served<br />\nand usually consists of a Big<br />\nMac, western fries, and a large<br />\nCoke. A late-night snack may<br />\nalso be given. As can be expected, food intake is<br />\nmonitored very carefully, and<br />\nany food not eaten is carefully<br />\nnoted by the assistants. Dosage<br />\nis given at a set time, after<br />\nwhich, the participants are free<br />\nto do as they wish until the 1:00<br />\na.m. lights-out. This is an excellent time to do homework,<br />\nplay cards, or just meet new<br />\npeople. Nobody, however, is<br />\nallowed to leave the premises.<br />\nThe subjects are waked up<br />\nearly to give a sample. A series<br />\nof subsequent samples are<br />\ntaken throughout the day and<br />\nevening. The participants are<br />\nthen free to go home early<br />\nSaturday night. To complete<br />\nthe tests, the subjects must also<br />\ngive \"return samples.\" They<br />\nmust come back to the facility<br />\nthe following Sunday and Monday for just a few minutes. In<br />\nthis way, Pharmakinetics can<br />\nmeasure the rate at which the<br />\nmedicine disappears from the<br />\nbloodstream. An interim<br />\nperiod, during which the subjects are under no obligation,<br />\nthen elapses, usually lasting one<br />\nto two weeks. The overnight<br />\nstay and return samples are<br />\nthen repeated, with the second<br />\nmedicine used in place of the<br />\nfirst.<br />\nIn general, about fifteen<br />\nsamples are taken, usually<br />\namounting to about a pint. On<br />\nthe day of the last return sample, the subjects receive the<br />\nbulk of their payment. In addition, a monetary bonus is given<br />\nto those who have been on time<br />\nfor all dosages and return<br />\nsamples. Bonuses are also given<br />\nto exceptionally cooperative<br />\ngroups or individuals.<br />\nAll in all, the program is a<br />\ngreat way to earn decent money<br />\nwith little personal bother.<br />\nPunctuality is the main concern, though some of you Hutdwellers may have problems<br />\nwith your No-Doze, and you of<br />\nthe particularly boisterous frats<br />\nmay have difficulties with the<br />\ntemperance required. The<br />\nPharmakinetics program isn't<br />\nthe Gilman Coffee Shop or the<br />\nUnion Desk (in fact, at times<br />\nyou may feel like one of those<br />\nlittle white furry things that inhabit the basement of Ames)<br />\nbut for excitement and profit<br />\nit's hard to beat.

Surprisingly, only 10 total innings<br />\nwere played during the day,<br />\nwith both contests stopped and<br />\nvictory awarded to the Jays<br />\nbecause of the 10-run rule,<br />\nwhich states that if a team is<br />\nahead by 10 or more runs after<br />\n5 full innings of play [usually in<br />\na game of a doubleheader] the<br />\ncontest is over. Blue Jays<br />\nCoach Bobby Babb was happy<br />\nto get the wins but would rather<br />\nhave gotten more game experience. \"The weather [last<br />\nweek] got us off to a slow start.<br />\nWe've only been able to practice 3 or 4 times outside on our<br />\nfield, and to have the games<br />\nshortened today, well, it's one<br />\ntime that I didn't favor the 10run rule.\"<br />\nIt's a good thing for the<br />\nvisiting Bears that the 10-run<br />\nrule was in effect, or the teams<br />\nwould probably still be out<br />\nthere playing. Morgan State<br />\nwas simply no match for the<br />\nveteran Blue Jays, who managed to collect 22 runs on 12<br />\nhits. To put it simply, the Jays<br />\nhardly resembled a team that<br />\nhad only been outside 3 times.<br />\nEven if Morgan State wasn't so<br />\nbad (1 unearned run on 4 hits)<br />\nthey still would have been hard<br /><br />\npressed to make a game of it.<br />\nThat's how good the Jays were<br />\nTuesday.<br />\nIn the first game, Senior CoCaptain Mark Campbell shut<br />\ndown Morgan 1-2-3 in the top<br />\nof the 1st, setting the stage for<br />\nthe Jays' offensive onslaught.<br />\nSophomore Tom Finegan got<br />\nthings rolling with a single to<br />\nright, then promptly stole second.

The Blue Jays compiled a<br />\n4-5 record in their first season,<br />\nbut the record does not reflect<br />\nthe work put in by this inaugural team.<br />\nWestern Maryland took to<br />\nthe ice looking for revenge; in<br />\nprevious meetings, Hopkins<br />\nhanded them defeats to the tune<br />\nof 5-4 and 6-4. The Green Terrors started the game playing a<br />\nhard checking style of hockey,<br />\nand it paid off as they were first<br />\nto score, with just three minutes<br />\nto go the first period. Hopkins<br />\nwas quick to respond, and less<br />\nthan a minute later Bill Marquardt, assisted by Dave<br />\nHayward and Ed Giobbe, put<br />\nthe puck in the net for the Jays.<br />\nAgain less than a minute later,<br />\nMarquardt hit again, this time<br />\nassisted by Christ Verica. The<br />\nperiod ended with the Jays on<br />\ntop 2-1.<br />\nThe Jays continued to<br />\ndominate in the second period,<br />\nwith goals by Nils Youngwall<br />\n(assisted by Pat Gibbons) and<br /><br />\nGibbons (assisted by Mike<br />\nEhrlich). However, the all important M Factor, momentum,<br />\nseemed to shift to the Green<br />\nTerrors half way through the<br />\nsecond period, as they went on<br />\nto score three unanswered goals<br />\n(two in the third period, one<br />\nmore in the third) to tie the<br />\ngame at four apiece.<br />\nThe Blue Jays were able to<br />\nrespond after nearly a twenty<br />\nminute dry spell with a goal by<br />\nJamie Herring, assisted by CoCaptain Andy Gray. Herring<br />\ngot his second goal of the evening during the same shift, just<br />\nthirty-three seconds after his<br />\nfirst goal (assisted by CoCaptains Bill Dwyer and Andy<br />\nGray). Bill Marquardt completed his hat trick on an<br />\nunassisted goal. Chris Verica,<br />\nassisted by Nils Youngwall,<br />\nscored the Jays' eighth goal,<br />\nand Gil Burnett, assisted by<br />\nGibbons and Giobbe, tallied<br />\nHopkins' ninth goal. Western<br />\nMaryland was able to score<br />\nonce more, but it never appeared that they would threaten<br />\na comeback, as Burnett scored<br />\nthe final goal of the game on<br />\nassists by Youngwall and<br />\nGibbons.<br />\nThe hockey team's outlook<br /><br />\nfor next year's season is very<br />\npositive. Four seniors will be<br />\ngone (including co-founder and<br />\nCo-Captain Dwyer and Dave<br />\nHayward, second in team point<br />\ntotals), but many important<br />\nplayers will be returning, including defensive standouts<br />\nGiobbe and Youngwall, as well<br />\nas sophomore goalie Tom<br />\nMangiacapre.

In<br />\norder to qualify for the<br />\nNCAA's, Goldberg had to<br />\ncompete with fencers from<br />\nNYU, University of Pennsylvania, Duke, North Carolina,<br />\nand other top eastern universities for the 18 foil spots<br />\nallocated to the eastern schools.<br />\nBecause of his 61-6 record, the<br />\nfact that he won the individual<br />\nfoil title at the MAC's and<br />\nbecause he has already fenced<br />\nat the NCAA's twice, Goldberg<br />\nhad no problem qualifying for<br />\nthis year's NCAA championships.<br />\nIn his four years at Hopkins,<br />\nGoldberg has distinguished<br />\nhimself as a top fencer. As a<br />\nfreshman he won the under-19<br />\nSectionals and took 5th place at<br />\nthe MAC's. In the next three<br />\nyears he won the individual<br />\nMAC foil title three times, led<br />\nthe foil team to MAC team<br />\ntrophies twice, and won the<br />\nMaryland State Championships. Meanwhile, Goldberg<br />\ncompiled an unbelievable fouryear record of 201 wins and less<br />\nthan 25 losses!!<br />\nAccording to coach Dick<br />\nOles, \"He'll be fencing against<br />\nthe top 30 foilsmen in the country and he may make it to the<br />\nthird round [of four].\"<br />\n\"At the USFA Collegiate<br />\nOpen, Andy fenced against<br />\nmost of the same guys that will<br /><br />\n_<br />\n11111111111<br />\n_<br /><br />\nCOLLEGE<br />\nFENCING<br />\nREVIEW<br /><br />\nLay itontheline.<br /><br />\nFew fans are aware of Al's fencing<br />\nprowess in his (hos al Marquefie<br /><br />\nbe at the NCAA's and he took<br />\nsixth place.

Out of 18<br />\nsabre spots available, Shao was<br />\n18th. At the MAC Championships, Shao led his sabre team<br />\nto win the sabre team trophy<br />\nand he, himself, won the individual sabre title.
