To attack the University on the grounds that it is<br />\nfollowing a policy purchasing<br />\nsafe dwellings for students which<br />\nwill require little further rennovation, which are convenient to<br />\ncampus and are \"financially<br />\nsolid\" rather than plunging into<br />\na program of urban renewal away<br />\nfrom the Homewood seems at the<br />\nleast, ludicrous.<br />\nThe University's primary obligation is to the student and to the<br />\ndevelopment of more efficient and<br />\nhigher quality education at all<br />\nlevels and in all academic areas,<br />\nnot urban renewal and financial<br />\ninvestment in Lapides' own district.<br />\nThe suggestions and the challenges issued by Walter Brooks,<br />\nBill Henry, and the Reverend<br />\nRobert Meissner in the very same<br />\narticle were thought provoking<br />\nand should be examined and<br />\nacted upon by the whole Hopkins<br />\ncommunity.

Franke<br />\n<br />\nGerms Under The Microscope<br />\nBacteriological warfare research is going on at<br />\nHopkins. The fact has been investigated and reported in<br />\nseveral national magazines as well as in the News-Letter.<br />\nPresident Milton Eisenhower's press statement on the<br />\nmatter Wednesday was merely a further confirmation of<br />\nthe fact.<br />\nThe subject of bacteriological warfare research has<br />\nbeen considered a highly touchy topic ever since the end<br />\nof the First World War, when the research went underground. The Army, and participating institutions such<br />\nas Hopkins, have kept the matter of bacteriological warfare research under the strictest security for two reasons\u2014that it is in the national interest, and that it may<br />\ncause overly antagonistic public opinion. We will not<br />\nargue whether such research is in the national interest,<br />\nnor shall we argue the reasons involved in the pursuit of<br />\nsuch research. The matter of importance here is the<br />\nfact that Hopkins, a private educational institution,' is<br />\nInvolved in bacteriological warfare research.<br />\nThe research at Hopkins, both at the Medical Institutions and elsewhere, started more than a decade ago,<br />\nand its extent is positively pandemic. The press statement released Wednesday was a whitewash. In the release it was stated that $30 million was the total for<br />\nGovernment connected research \u2014 unfortunately the<br />\nfigure is $80 million to all Hopkins institutions. The administration statement further claimed that only one per<br />\ncent of the work is classified\u2014the actual number of research reports available only with security clearance exceeds one per cent. Bacteriological warfare research is<br />\nincluded in this classified category.<br />\nThe argument given to defend BW research is that<br />\nit deals \"exclusively with the diagnosis, pathogenesis,<br />\nand epidemiology of infectious diseases that might resuit from exposure to either biological or chemical warfare agents. . All research has been 'defensive' in<br />\ncharacter and any implication to the contrary is false.\"<br />\nThat the word \"defensive\" is singled out in the state.<br />\nment is indicative of die lack of conviction it carries.<br />\n:What are defensive and offensive weapons? An overwhelming number of experts in the field state that there<br />\ncan be no differentiation between the two\u2014especially<br />\nin connection with germ and chemical warfare. A high<br />\nranking officr connected with the research has admitted<br />\nthat no division can be made between a morally justiable defensive weapon and the more odious use of offensive germ weapons. In light of the facts this \"defensive\" argument is demolished, anti yet the Hopkins<br />\ncommunity is warned not to heed arguments against<br />\nbacteriological research with the desperate remark that<br />\n\"any implication to the contrary is false.\" President<br />\nEisenhower's statement to the press about bacteriological<br />\nwarfare is an inaccurate reply to concerned students and<br />\nfaculty.<br />\nResearch belongs in the University anti makes up<br />\na vital part of both the educational anti service roles<br />\nthat Hopkins plays. But an educational institution must<br />\nalso keep in mind the premise upon which it has been<br />\nfounded\u2014to enrich and expand the mind of men for<br />\nthe good of other men. Research pursued with the goal<br />\nof \"utilization for incapacitation\", as the Army Research<br />\nTask Summary describes it, does not belong at this<br />\nUniversity. If the Government wishes to conduct bacteriological research it should buy out the labs and the<br />\nscientists and do the work on its own. A university is<br />\nnot in the business of destroying life, it is engaged in<br />\nthe practice of 'saving and enriching life. It is particu.<br />\nlarly ironic that some of the B.W. research is going on<br />\nIn the Department of Pathology at the world renowned<br />\nHopkins Medical Institutions.<br />\nThe relationship between the Government and the<br />\nhigher educational system in the United States enters<br />\ninto this discussion. The Government is the largest single<br />\ncontributer to colleges and universities in both institutional financing and research contracts. Government<br />\nfinancing is often beneficial both to the institutions and<br />\nthe Government. There arise, however, several dangers\u2014<br />\nconflict of interest and Government manipulation of<br />\nhigher education, among others. Germ and chemical<br />\nwarfare research is not in our sphere of interest, if not<br />\nantithetical to Mir avowed interests and goals. The danger<br />\nof Government manipulation following on the heels of<br />\nheavy Government support of education is a disturbing<br />\ncorollary attached to research contracts.<br />\nWe urge the administration to reject research contracts dealing with bacteriological warfare and put the<br />\nlaboratories at the Medical Institutions to better use. If<br />\nprompt action from the Hopkins administration is not<br />\nforthcoming, we hope that the faculty will not betray<br />\nthe trust of their profession and that the students will<br />\nnot ignore their sense of duty.<br />\n<br />\nHOMEWOOD, BALTIMORE, MAY 5, 1967<br />\n<br />\nI Germ Warfarein Re-an<br />\n<br />\nI<br />\n<br />\nBy ELIA KATZwith the dirtiest<br />\nthe time a little fortress with<br />\nworld\u2014the men with homocidal twin-88s and bottles and bottles<br />\nsmartness.

Why<br />\nShould the University follow such<br />\na self-centered and \"unprogressive\" attitude of purchasing off<br />\ncampus student dwellings,\"fmancially sound, taxpaying, and<br />\nsolid,\" which are near the Homewood campus, when it can purchase dwellings in the poorer<br />\nareas of the city, blocks away<br />\nfrom the campus and requiring<br />\nenormous amounts of money for<br />\nrennovation?<br />\nWhile agreeing that the UniverSity should and could play a<br />\ngreater role in the eradication of<br />\nCity and neighborhood problems,<br />\nas well as an innovator in other<br />\ncritical urban areas, I think that<br />\nSenator Lapides' fuzzy thinking<br />\ndoes his cause more harm than<br />\ngood. To meet the challenges of<br />\nUrban problems requires response tempered by conviction<br />\nand thought. To attack the University on the grounds that it is<br />\nfollowing a policy purchasing<br />\nsafe dwellings for students which<br />\nwill require little further rennovation, which are convenient to<br />\ncampus and are \"financially<br />\nsolid\" rather than plunging into<br />\na program of urban renewal away<br />\nfrom the Homewood seems at the<br />\nleast, ludicrous.<br />\nThe University's primary obligation is to the student and to the<br />\ndevelopment of more efficient and<br />\nhigher quality education at all<br />\nlevels and in all academic areas,<br />\nnot urban renewal and financial<br />\ninvestment in Lapides' own district.<br />\nThe suggestions and the challenges issued by Walter Brooks,<br />\nBill Henry, and the Reverend<br />\nRobert Meissner in the very same<br />\narticle were thought provoking<br />\nand should be examined and<br />\nacted upon by the whole Hopkins<br />\ncommunity.

Franke<br /><br />\nGerms Under The Microscope<br />\nBacteriological warfare research is going on at<br />\nHopkins. The fact has been investigated and reported in<br />\nseveral national magazines as well as in the News-Letter.<br />\nPresident Milton Eisenhower's press statement on the<br />\nmatter Wednesday was merely a further confirmation of<br />\nthe fact.<br />\nThe subject of bacteriological warfare research has<br />\nbeen considered a highly touchy topic ever since the end<br />\nof the First World War, when the research went underground. The Army, and participating institutions such<br />\nas Hopkins, have kept the matter of bacteriological warfare research under the strictest security for two reasons\u2014that it is in the national interest, and that it may<br />\ncause overly antagonistic public opinion. We will not<br />\nargue whether such research is in the national interest,<br />\nnor shall we argue the reasons involved in the pursuit of<br />\nsuch research. The matter of importance here is the<br />\nfact that Hopkins, a private educational institution,' is<br />\nInvolved in bacteriological warfare research.<br />\nThe research at Hopkins, both at the Medical Institutions and elsewhere, started more than a decade ago,<br />\nand its extent is positively pandemic. The press statement released Wednesday was a whitewash. In the release it was stated that $30 million was the total for<br />\nGovernment connected research \u2014 unfortunately the<br />\nfigure is $80 million to all Hopkins institutions. The administration statement further claimed that only one per<br />\ncent of the work is classified\u2014the actual number of research reports available only with security clearance exceeds one per cent. Bacteriological warfare research is<br />\nincluded in this classified category.<br />\nThe argument given to defend BW research is that<br />\nit deals \"exclusively with the diagnosis, pathogenesis,<br />\nand epidemiology of infectious diseases that might resuit from exposure to either biological or chemical warfare agents. . All research has been 'defensive' in<br />\ncharacter and any implication to the contrary is false.\"<br />\nThat the word \"defensive\" is singled out in the state.<br />\nment is indicative of die lack of conviction it carries.<br />\n:What are defensive and offensive weapons? An overwhelming number of experts in the field state that there<br />\ncan be no differentiation between the two\u2014especially<br />\nin connection with germ and chemical warfare. A high<br />\nranking officr connected with the research has admitted<br />\nthat no division can be made between a morally justiable defensive weapon and the more odious use of offensive germ weapons. In light of the facts this \"defensive\" argument is demolished, anti yet the Hopkins<br />\ncommunity is warned not to heed arguments against<br />\nbacteriological research with the desperate remark that<br />\n\"any implication to the contrary is false.\" President<br />\nEisenhower's statement to the press about bacteriological<br />\nwarfare is an inaccurate reply to concerned students and<br />\nfaculty.<br />\nResearch belongs in the University anti makes up<br />\na vital part of both the educational anti service roles<br />\nthat Hopkins plays. But an educational institution must<br />\nalso keep in mind the premise upon which it has been<br />\nfounded\u2014to enrich and expand the mind of men for<br />\nthe good of other men. Research pursued with the goal<br />\nof \"utilization for incapacitation\", as the Army Research<br />\nTask Summary describes it, does not belong at this<br />\nUniversity. If the Government wishes to conduct bacteriological research it should buy out the labs and the<br />\nscientists and do the work on its own. A university is<br />\nnot in the business of destroying life, it is engaged in<br />\nthe practice of 'saving and enriching life. It is particu.<br />\nlarly ironic that some of the B.W. research is going on<br />\nIn the Department of Pathology at the world renowned<br />\nHopkins Medical Institutions.<br />\nThe relationship between the Government and the<br />\nhigher educational system in the United States enters<br />\ninto this discussion. The Government is the largest single<br />\ncontributer to colleges and universities in both institutional financing and research contracts. Government<br />\nfinancing is often beneficial both to the institutions and<br />\nthe Government. There arise, however, several dangers\u2014<br />\nconflict of interest and Government manipulation of<br />\nhigher education, among others. Germ and chemical<br />\nwarfare research is not in our sphere of interest, if not<br />\nantithetical to Mir avowed interests and goals. The danger<br />\nof Government manipulation following on the heels of<br />\nheavy Government support of education is a disturbing<br />\ncorollary attached to research contracts.<br />\nWe urge the administration to reject research contracts dealing with bacteriological warfare and put the<br />\nlaboratories at the Medical Institutions to better use. If<br />\nprompt action from the Hopkins administration is not<br />\nforthcoming, we hope that the faculty will not betray<br />\nthe trust of their profession and that the students will<br />\nnot ignore their sense of duty.<br /><br />\nHOMEWOOD, BALTIMORE, MAY 5, 1967<br /><br />\nI Germ Warfarein Re-an<br /><br />\nI<br /><br />\nBy ELIA KATZwith the dirtiest<br />\nthe time a little fortress with<br />\nworld\u2014the men with homocidal twin-88s and bottles and bottles<br />\nsmartness.
