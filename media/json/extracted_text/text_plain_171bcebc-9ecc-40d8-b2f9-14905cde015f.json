It was a very disheartening state of affairs for any'pne who really cared about the<br />\n\"Black and Blue\" down there on<br />\nthe field. It was true that neither<br />\nteam displayed any appreciable<br />\namount \u00a3>f brilliant playing and that<br />\nat times, the game became slow and<br />\nuninteresting. Nevertheless, that<br />\ndid not excuse the Jay rooters from<br />\nletting the \"pig-skin carriers\" know<br />\nthat they were in the stands, and<br />\nthat they were pulling for them.<br />\nThis is the first year, to our<br />\nknowledge, that the Blue Jay football team has played a game on its<br />\nhome ground without at least one<br />\ncheer leader to head the rooters in<br />\na few yells. The reason for this we<br />\ndo not know, but we think that such<br />\na situation should not be allowed<br />\nto arise again.<br />\nWe realize that since the abolition<br />\nof all freshmen regulation two years<br />\nago, the yearlings are given a free<br />\nhand and are no longer required to<br />\nform in line in front of Gilman<br />\nHall before the game and march up<br />\nCharles Street and into Homewood<br />\nField preceeded by the Johns Hopkins Band. In those days the teams<br />\nwere always guaranteed a certain<br />\namount of support, namely that<br />\ngiven it by the frosh rooters.<br />\nUnder our present system, some<br />\nof the freshmen take enough in\u00b7<br />\nterest in the teams to come out and<br />\nlend their support to the 'leven,<br />\nothers, not quite so enthusiastic as<br />\nthe first mentioned, come to the<br />\ngames, but do not so much as open<br />\ntheir mouths to let out a single peep<br />\nduring the whole game, while the<br />\nremainder think that they have<br />\nmany other things more important<br />\nto do and stay away entirely-these<br />\nlatter ones, we feel moved to say,<br />\nhave a very poor and unenviable<br />\nspirit.<br />\nWe hope that these few words<br />\nthat we have printed above will<br />\ntouch the pride and latent spirits of<br />\nsome few individuals and that they<br />\nwill be inspired to literally \"come<br />\nout to Homewood and see Johnny<br />\nHopkins play!\"<br />\n<br />\nSuccessor To Dr. Bull<br />\nBeing Sought<br />\n<br />\nA committee is now endeavoring<br />\nto select a successor to Dr. Carroll<br />\nG.

It was a very disheartening state of affairs for any'pne who really cared about the<br />\n\"Black and Blue\" down there on<br />\nthe field. It was true that neither<br />\nteam displayed any appreciable<br />\namount \u00a3&gt;f brilliant playing and that<br />\nat times, the game became slow and<br />\nuninteresting. Nevertheless, that<br />\ndid not excuse the Jay rooters from<br />\nletting the \"pig-skin carriers\" know<br />\nthat they were in the stands, and<br />\nthat they were pulling for them.<br />\nThis is the first year, to our<br />\nknowledge, that the Blue Jay football team has played a game on its<br />\nhome ground without at least one<br />\ncheer leader to head the rooters in<br />\na few yells. The reason for this we<br />\ndo not know, but we think that such<br />\na situation should not be allowed<br />\nto arise again.<br />\nWe realize that since the abolition<br />\nof all freshmen regulation two years<br />\nago, the yearlings are given a free<br />\nhand and are no longer required to<br />\nform in line in front of Gilman<br />\nHall before the game and march up<br />\nCharles Street and into Homewood<br />\nField preceeded by the Johns Hopkins Band. In those days the teams<br />\nwere always guaranteed a certain<br />\namount of support, namely that<br />\ngiven it by the frosh rooters.<br />\nUnder our present system, some<br />\nof the freshmen take enough in\u00b7<br />\nterest in the teams to come out and<br />\nlend their support to the 'leven,<br />\nothers, not quite so enthusiastic as<br />\nthe first mentioned, come to the<br />\ngames, but do not so much as open<br />\ntheir mouths to let out a single peep<br />\nduring the whole game, while the<br />\nremainder think that they have<br />\nmany other things more important<br />\nto do and stay away entirely-these<br />\nlatter ones, we feel moved to say,<br />\nhave a very poor and unenviable<br />\nspirit.<br />\nWe hope that these few words<br />\nthat we have printed above will<br />\ntouch the pride and latent spirits of<br />\nsome few individuals and that they<br />\nwill be inspired to literally \"come<br />\nout to Homewood and see Johnny<br />\nHopkins play!\"<br /><br />\nSuccessor To Dr. Bull<br />\nBeing Sought<br /><br />\nA committee is now endeavoring<br />\nto select a successor to Dr. Carroll<br />\nG.
