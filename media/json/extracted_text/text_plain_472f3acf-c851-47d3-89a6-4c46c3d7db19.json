It<br />\nhas just as often failed. After every experiment in<br />\nnon-compulsory assemblies the Student council has<br />\nbeen forced to return to the universally despised policy<br />\nof dragging in the freshmen by bogey-man tactics.<br />\nVoluntary assemblies have always been regarded<br />\nas the ideal. Their recurrent failure may be blamed<br />\npartly on the lack of cooperation by the student body<br />\nand partly on poor direction by the Student council.<br />\nWith the establishment of an Assembly commission<br />\nhaving complete and strict authority over all future<br />\nassemblies, we can optimistically expect forceful leadership, careful Planning.

Further effects will be forthcoming: we can see<br />\na sad blow to the Honor system here as this disease<br />\nprogresses, for one thing. We know of men who have<br />\ndropped courses, lest they miss their \"pre-medical\" B.<br />\nTo our knowledge, no one ever dropped a course because he was just missing an H.<br />\nOf course, we realize that we haven-t mentioned the<br />\nmain reason for the change: the supposed advantages<br />\nto men competing for entrance into professional or<br />\ngraduate schools. This result will not be open to<br />\njudgment for some time to come. But may we repeat,<br />\nwe did offer a plan to salvage the fine points of H, S,<br />\nand F while securing the advantages of A, B, C.<br />\nWe hope that ultimate results will justify the<br />\nchange and the evils it has introduced, but we seriously<br />\ndoubt it. The further we get from the men who worked<br />\nunder the old system, the more progressively difficult<br />\nwill it become to restore to the student body their<br />\nspirit of scholarship, and their concepts of education.<br />\nWe realize that at present we're a lone, lost voice<br />\nin the wilderness ,but still, we plead for an early return<br />\nto a modified H, S, F system.<br />\nSt John's novel \"100-book<br />\nplan\" of education ensured<br />\nto our minds academic freedom of the highest type. We<br />\ndetect a news item of some<br />\ndate ,however, which is somewhat beyond our comprehension.<br />\nUnder a new ruling, there are no cuts allowed at<br />\nSt John's. True, students may get excuses from doctors, parents, or instructors, but the venerable collegiate institution, the out and out cut, has been eliminated. How this fits into St John's scheme is beyond<br />\nus, unless it is in keeping with their \"if-any-other-college-has-it, to-hell-with-it\" attitude.<br />\nHopkins looks on the cut as a symbol of student<br />\nmaturity.

Nevertheless, we<br />\nare forced to maintain that our editorial was not colored,<br />\nnor was it fallacious.<br />\n1. The \"well-thought-out\" questionairre of the assembly committee which so thoroughly \"canvassed public opinion in the freshman class\" was conducted as<br />\nfollows:<br />\n70 ballots were distributed. 45 were returned. Of<br />\nthese there was a tendency to favor recreational type<br />\nof assemblies; and an overwhelming sympathy for noncompusory assemblies. We see two flaws immediately.<br />\nFirst, the Council is not giving preference to \"recreational assemblies\". These are to be incidental. Second,<br />\nhaving non-compulsory assemblies immediately changes<br />\nthe face of the problem from a freshman one, to one<br />\ninvolving the whole student body. The fact of the<br />\nmatter is that upper-classmen rather than freshmen<br />\ncomprise the bulk of attendance at non-compulsory<br />\ngatherings. We hardly consider 45 votes, 5% of tile<br />\nstudent body, and, not a cross-section (all freshmen),<br />\na pertinent canvass of public opinion.<br />\n2. We applied the criticism of procrastination to the<br />\nB Si A matter in particular. And we insist that the late<br />\ndate at which this matter was broached, points to nothing less. Still nothing has been done about dead wood<br />\non the B S A.<br />\n3. Mr. Williams grants point three.

HOPKINS<br />\n<br />\nBy Eddie Rubin<br />\nYour roaming reporter traveled up<br />\nto Swarthmore, Pa, last Saturday<br />\nwith high hopes of watching the Jay<br />\neleven win their fourth straight game<br />\nof the season against an undefeated<br />\nSwathmore team. Of<br />\n<br />\ncourse,<br />\n<br />\nyou<br />\n<br />\nknow that I was to be denied this<br />\npleasure; but in return I witnessed<br />\nwhat I thought was the best Hopkins<br />\nfootball team in action I had ever<br />\nseen.<br />\nYes, even though the Black and<br />\nBlue team was shut-out 10-0, and<br />\neven though the Jays were outgained<br />\non the ground, 250 yards to 150<br />\nyards, the Jays were superb in defeat<br />\nand here is why ...<br />\nThe Blue team was blocking better<br />\nthan they have ever blocked in recent years. It was really a pleasure<br />\nto watch the Jays mow down their<br />\nOpponents with clear-cut, open-field<br />\nbody blocks. In the last quarter, after<br />\nSwartlunore added three points to<br />\ntheir score on Jakie's 20 yard field<br />\ngoal, Spilman took the kick-off on his<br />\nown 10 and behind *almost perfect<br />\nblocking, returned the ball to midfield before the last man between<br />\nhim and the goal line finally brought<br />\nhim down. Another thing, in the most<br />\npart Ed had all day to pass, the<br />\nblocking was so good. Their pass defense was just too<br />\n<br />\ngood for the<br />\n<br />\nJays\u2014they knew every pass play and<br />\nstill we made 87 yards on passes.<br />\nAnother very noticable characteristic of the game was the fact, that<br />\nafter<br />\n<br />\nthe<br />\n<br />\nSwarthmore<br />\n<br />\ntouchdown,<br />\n<br />\nwhich came in the first five minutes<br />\nof the game, the Garnet ground attack was so completely bottled, except for a few end runs, that approximately two of every 3 of their plays<br />\nwere passes, and several times they<br />\nchose to kick on first down. The Jay<br />\nline from tackle to tackle was doing<br />\nyoemen service in stopping the hard<br />\ncharging Swarthmore backs.<br />\nCharley Eberle was just too fast<br />\nand too shifty for the Jay ends. Both<br />\nCapt Milligan and Carroll were fighting hard to stop the fleet-footed<br />\nGarnet back. They succeeded for the<br />\nmost part except for the opening<br />\ntouchdown<br />\n<br />\nrun<br />\n<br />\nand<br />\n<br />\nseveral<br />\n<br />\nlast<br />\n<br />\nquarter sprints, afte rhe had rested<br />\non the bench the entire third quarter.<br />\nHowever, the Blue team had the<br />\nbest all-around back on the field in<br />\nthe person of Edgar H Spilman. Spilman was once again the spear-head<br />\nof the Jays on both offense. He ripped off several nice runs, besides<br />\nmore than matching Eberle's punts,<br />\nand of course, he handled most of the<br />\nJays passes in addition to being on<br />\nthe receiving end when ne wasn't<br />\nthrowing 'em. His play in the safety<br />\nposition was more than enough to<br />\nkeep him \u2022busy the entire afternoon,<br />\nbatting down passes and stopping<br />\nEberle.<br />\nCharley Rudo handled his linebucking assignments with more drive<br />\nthan ever. Charley was tearing the<br />\ncenter of the Swarthmore line to<br />\nshreds as he ripped off 10 and 15<br />\nyard jaunts to account for most of<br />\nthe Jays 150 yards gained on the<br />\nground. Considering the foes, Rudo's<br />\nassignments were doubled since McLean was out, and we had no one to<br />\nskirt the ends. Charley really made<br />\nthe Swarthmore forward wall look<br />\nsick.<br />\nAnd therein lay the weakness of<br />\nthe team, almost everyone who saw<br />\nthe game was convinced that the<br />\nJays would have won with a fast<br />\nrunner to skirt the ends . . .

The last speaker in the<br />\nseries will be Rabbi Heller of Cincinnati, Ohio.<br />\n, Dr Cavert emphasized the point<br />\nthat we miss the great spiritual truth<br />\nof Christianity by becoming lost in<br />\nmethodological detail. The Bible<br />\nshould not be taken literally. It is<br />\nthe means by which a record of history is compiled and written for<br />\nman.<br />\nThe speaker traced briefly the history of Christianity and the great<br />\ndisruptions that took place within its<br />\nranks. There was the Western faction<br />\nIn Rome and the Eastern faction in<br />\nConstantinople. From this Eastern<br />\nfaction arose the Russian orthodox<br />\nCatholic religion of today.<br />\nThe discussion also brought out<br />\nthe fact that the Protestant does not<br />\nvalue the unity of organization as<br />\ndoes the Catholic. Instead, he values<br />\nthe unity of the spirit. Thus, Protestantism is the great religious assertion<br />\nof liberty. At this point, the fact that<br />\nthe colony of Maryland was the first<br />\namong early American settlements<br />\nto present the opportunity for religous freedom was noted. It was emphasized, though, that most complete<br />\nfreedom of expression came in Rhode<br />\nIsland under the direction of Roger<br />\nA fine point in American democracy was pointed out by Dr Cavert.<br />\nHe stated that if the Catholics are<br />\ncorrect in their assumption that they<br />\nalone have spiritual authority, then<br />\nthey are entirely justified in being<br />\nnon-Catholics.<br />\ntoward<br />\nintolerant<br />\nHowever, this entirely contrary to<br />\nthe American ideal. In this country<br />\nwe work under assumption that<br />\neveryone is justified in his own religous belief.<br />\nFrom this point Dr Cavert went<br />\non to outline the basic differences<br />\nbetween the Jew and the Christian.<br />\nThese differences are essentially<br />\nsocial and economic ones. The Jewish<br />\npeople of today have too great a<br />\ntendency to make out of their religion a race. If they would attempt<br />\nto break down these false barriers<br />\nthere would arise a universalization<br />\nof Judaism. Such a result would most<br />\ncertainly bring about a deeper understanding between the Jew and the<br />\nChristian.<br />\nWith Dr Cavert's lecture the end<br />\nof the present series is now at hand.<br />\nIn all, there will have been six<br />\nspeeches.

It<br />\nhas just as often failed. After every experiment in<br />\nnon-compulsory assemblies the Student council has<br />\nbeen forced to return to the universally despised policy<br />\nof dragging in the freshmen by bogey-man tactics.<br />\nVoluntary assemblies have always been regarded<br />\nas the ideal. Their recurrent failure may be blamed<br />\npartly on the lack of cooperation by the student body<br />\nand partly on poor direction by the Student council.<br />\nWith the establishment of an Assembly commission<br />\nhaving complete and strict authority over all future<br />\nassemblies, we can optimistically expect forceful leadership, careful Planning.

Further effects will be forthcoming: we can see<br />\na sad blow to the Honor system here as this disease<br />\nprogresses, for one thing. We know of men who have<br />\ndropped courses, lest they miss their \"pre-medical\" B.<br />\nTo our knowledge, no one ever dropped a course because he was just missing an H.<br />\nOf course, we realize that we haven-t mentioned the<br />\nmain reason for the change: the supposed advantages<br />\nto men competing for entrance into professional or<br />\ngraduate schools. This result will not be open to<br />\njudgment for some time to come. But may we repeat,<br />\nwe did offer a plan to salvage the fine points of H, S,<br />\nand F while securing the advantages of A, B, C.<br />\nWe hope that ultimate results will justify the<br />\nchange and the evils it has introduced, but we seriously<br />\ndoubt it. The further we get from the men who worked<br />\nunder the old system, the more progressively difficult<br />\nwill it become to restore to the student body their<br />\nspirit of scholarship, and their concepts of education.<br />\nWe realize that at present we're a lone, lost voice<br />\nin the wilderness ,but still, we plead for an early return<br />\nto a modified H, S, F system.<br />\nSt John's novel \"100-book<br />\nplan\" of education ensured<br />\nto our minds academic freedom of the highest type. We<br />\ndetect a news item of some<br />\ndate ,however, which is somewhat beyond our comprehension.<br />\nUnder a new ruling, there are no cuts allowed at<br />\nSt John's. True, students may get excuses from doctors, parents, or instructors, but the venerable collegiate institution, the out and out cut, has been eliminated. How this fits into St John's scheme is beyond<br />\nus, unless it is in keeping with their \"if-any-other-college-has-it, to-hell-with-it\" attitude.<br />\nHopkins looks on the cut as a symbol of student<br />\nmaturity.

Nevertheless, we<br />\nare forced to maintain that our editorial was not colored,<br />\nnor was it fallacious.<br />\n1. The \"well-thought-out\" questionairre of the assembly committee which so thoroughly \"canvassed public opinion in the freshman class\" was conducted as<br />\nfollows:<br />\n70 ballots were distributed. 45 were returned. Of<br />\nthese there was a tendency to favor recreational type<br />\nof assemblies; and an overwhelming sympathy for noncompusory assemblies. We see two flaws immediately.<br />\nFirst, the Council is not giving preference to \"recreational assemblies\". These are to be incidental. Second,<br />\nhaving non-compulsory assemblies immediately changes<br />\nthe face of the problem from a freshman one, to one<br />\ninvolving the whole student body. The fact of the<br />\nmatter is that upper-classmen rather than freshmen<br />\ncomprise the bulk of attendance at non-compulsory<br />\ngatherings. We hardly consider 45 votes, 5% of tile<br />\nstudent body, and, not a cross-section (all freshmen),<br />\na pertinent canvass of public opinion.<br />\n2. We applied the criticism of procrastination to the<br />\nB Si A matter in particular. And we insist that the late<br />\ndate at which this matter was broached, points to nothing less. Still nothing has been done about dead wood<br />\non the B S A.<br />\n3. Mr. Williams grants point three.

HOPKINS<br /><br />\nBy Eddie Rubin<br />\nYour roaming reporter traveled up<br />\nto Swarthmore, Pa, last Saturday<br />\nwith high hopes of watching the Jay<br />\neleven win their fourth straight game<br />\nof the season against an undefeated<br />\nSwathmore team. Of<br /><br />\ncourse,<br /><br />\nyou<br /><br />\nknow that I was to be denied this<br />\npleasure; but in return I witnessed<br />\nwhat I thought was the best Hopkins<br />\nfootball team in action I had ever<br />\nseen.<br />\nYes, even though the Black and<br />\nBlue team was shut-out 10-0, and<br />\neven though the Jays were outgained<br />\non the ground, 250 yards to 150<br />\nyards, the Jays were superb in defeat<br />\nand here is why ...<br />\nThe Blue team was blocking better<br />\nthan they have ever blocked in recent years. It was really a pleasure<br />\nto watch the Jays mow down their<br />\nOpponents with clear-cut, open-field<br />\nbody blocks. In the last quarter, after<br />\nSwartlunore added three points to<br />\ntheir score on Jakie's 20 yard field<br />\ngoal, Spilman took the kick-off on his<br />\nown 10 and behind *almost perfect<br />\nblocking, returned the ball to midfield before the last man between<br />\nhim and the goal line finally brought<br />\nhim down. Another thing, in the most<br />\npart Ed had all day to pass, the<br />\nblocking was so good. Their pass defense was just too<br /><br />\ngood for the<br /><br />\nJays\u2014they knew every pass play and<br />\nstill we made 87 yards on passes.<br />\nAnother very noticable characteristic of the game was the fact, that<br />\nafter<br /><br />\nthe<br /><br />\nSwarthmore<br /><br />\ntouchdown,<br /><br />\nwhich came in the first five minutes<br />\nof the game, the Garnet ground attack was so completely bottled, except for a few end runs, that approximately two of every 3 of their plays<br />\nwere passes, and several times they<br />\nchose to kick on first down. The Jay<br />\nline from tackle to tackle was doing<br />\nyoemen service in stopping the hard<br />\ncharging Swarthmore backs.<br />\nCharley Eberle was just too fast<br />\nand too shifty for the Jay ends. Both<br />\nCapt Milligan and Carroll were fighting hard to stop the fleet-footed<br />\nGarnet back. They succeeded for the<br />\nmost part except for the opening<br />\ntouchdown<br /><br />\nrun<br /><br />\nand<br /><br />\nseveral<br /><br />\nlast<br /><br />\nquarter sprints, afte rhe had rested<br />\non the bench the entire third quarter.<br />\nHowever, the Blue team had the<br />\nbest all-around back on the field in<br />\nthe person of Edgar H Spilman. Spilman was once again the spear-head<br />\nof the Jays on both offense. He ripped off several nice runs, besides<br />\nmore than matching Eberle's punts,<br />\nand of course, he handled most of the<br />\nJays passes in addition to being on<br />\nthe receiving end when ne wasn't<br />\nthrowing 'em. His play in the safety<br />\nposition was more than enough to<br />\nkeep him \u2022busy the entire afternoon,<br />\nbatting down passes and stopping<br />\nEberle.<br />\nCharley Rudo handled his linebucking assignments with more drive<br />\nthan ever. Charley was tearing the<br />\ncenter of the Swarthmore line to<br />\nshreds as he ripped off 10 and 15<br />\nyard jaunts to account for most of<br />\nthe Jays 150 yards gained on the<br />\nground. Considering the foes, Rudo's<br />\nassignments were doubled since McLean was out, and we had no one to<br />\nskirt the ends. Charley really made<br />\nthe Swarthmore forward wall look<br />\nsick.<br />\nAnd therein lay the weakness of<br />\nthe team, almost everyone who saw<br />\nthe game was convinced that the<br />\nJays would have won with a fast<br />\nrunner to skirt the ends . . .

The last speaker in the<br />\nseries will be Rabbi Heller of Cincinnati, Ohio.<br />\n, Dr Cavert emphasized the point<br />\nthat we miss the great spiritual truth<br />\nof Christianity by becoming lost in<br />\nmethodological detail. The Bible<br />\nshould not be taken literally. It is<br />\nthe means by which a record of history is compiled and written for<br />\nman.<br />\nThe speaker traced briefly the history of Christianity and the great<br />\ndisruptions that took place within its<br />\nranks. There was the Western faction<br />\nIn Rome and the Eastern faction in<br />\nConstantinople. From this Eastern<br />\nfaction arose the Russian orthodox<br />\nCatholic religion of today.<br />\nThe discussion also brought out<br />\nthe fact that the Protestant does not<br />\nvalue the unity of organization as<br />\ndoes the Catholic. Instead, he values<br />\nthe unity of the spirit. Thus, Protestantism is the great religious assertion<br />\nof liberty. At this point, the fact that<br />\nthe colony of Maryland was the first<br />\namong early American settlements<br />\nto present the opportunity for religous freedom was noted. It was emphasized, though, that most complete<br />\nfreedom of expression came in Rhode<br />\nIsland under the direction of Roger<br />\nA fine point in American democracy was pointed out by Dr Cavert.<br />\nHe stated that if the Catholics are<br />\ncorrect in their assumption that they<br />\nalone have spiritual authority, then<br />\nthey are entirely justified in being<br />\nnon-Catholics.<br />\ntoward<br />\nintolerant<br />\nHowever, this entirely contrary to<br />\nthe American ideal. In this country<br />\nwe work under assumption that<br />\neveryone is justified in his own religous belief.<br />\nFrom this point Dr Cavert went<br />\non to outline the basic differences<br />\nbetween the Jew and the Christian.<br />\nThese differences are essentially<br />\nsocial and economic ones. The Jewish<br />\npeople of today have too great a<br />\ntendency to make out of their religion a race. If they would attempt<br />\nto break down these false barriers<br />\nthere would arise a universalization<br />\nof Judaism. Such a result would most<br />\ncertainly bring about a deeper understanding between the Jew and the<br />\nChristian.<br />\nWith Dr Cavert's lecture the end<br />\nof the present series is now at hand.<br />\nIn all, there will have been six<br />\nspeeches.
