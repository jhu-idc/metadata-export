It was announced Saturday<br />\nthat a student mass meeting will<br />\nbe held one day this week in order<br />\nto discuss the problem.<br />\nThe crisis in the financial affairs<br />\nof the Association was caused by<br />\nthe fact that the football season<br />\nnetted only one-twelfth of what it<br />\ndid last season. As football is the<br />\nbest paying sport at Hopkins, it<br />\nhas to be relied on to help the other<br />\nteams out. Three hundred dollars<br />\n(or less) will be turned over to<br />\nTreasurer Stewart. by Manager<br />\nHaynes. From this $300 must be<br />\nsubtracted $175 advanced by the<br />\nboard, leaving about $roo clear.<br />\nLast year the amount turned over<br />\nwas $1,400.<br />\nIf the Board had no obligations<br />\nother than those of financing the<br />\nteams, the problem would be a<br />\ncomparatively simple one. But<br />\nthere are two magnificent stands<br />\nat Homewood which the Association is expected to pay for. The<br />\nCost of each was about $8,000, and<br />\nif $1,500 could be turned over<br />\nevery year, as was the case last<br />\nseason, the whole $16,00o would<br />\nsoon be wiped out.<br />\nTo do the best it can, and to at<br />\nleast pay the interest on the cost<br />\nof the second stand and something<br />\ntoward the sinking fund, the Athletic Association is morally obligated. The proposition was made<br />\nto the trustees of the University<br />\nlast spring to put up the second<br />\nstand, as it was thought that it<br />\nwould be paying venture and that<br />\nthe added proceeds from the games<br />\n<br />\nit<br />\n<br />\nBALTIMORE, MD., DECEMBER 12, 1910.<br />\nwould in a short time pay for it.<br />\nThe trustees on account of the fact<br />\nthat they had a fair deficit to<br />\ndeal with, did not at first take<br />\nkindly to the proposal of going<br />\nfarther in debt. Mr. Blanchard<br />\nRandall, however, was in favor of<br />\nit. He had had the case presented<br />\nto him by a committee of the alumni, and the trustees allowed him<br />\nto go ahead. The understanding<br />\nwas, however, that the Athletic<br />\nAssociation was to pay the interest<br />\nand somethingon the principal. This<br />\naccording to present prospects they<br />\nwill be unable to do, and the Board<br />\nwill be forced to tell the trustees<br />\nthat because football didn't pay,<br />\nvery little can be paid on account<br />\nof the two concrete stands.<br />\nNow, why didn't football pay?<br />\nThere certainly were larger crowds<br />\nthan last year, except at the St.<br />\nJohn's game. The gross receipts<br />\nwere $2,opo greater. The team<br />\nwas better than ever before.<br />\nOf course, we are fully aware<br />\nthat the team had to pay $850 more<br />\nfor coaches than was the case last<br />\nyear when the alumni footed the<br />\nlarger part of the bill. But leaving<br />\nthis out of consideration, there<br />\nought to have been a larger net gain<br />\nthan $100. Nearly $500 was expended on a training table, which<br />\nvaluable as it may be, used up half<br />\na thousand dollars, which would<br />\nhave more than paid the interest<br />\non one stand.<br />\nThen there is the item of $900<br />\nfor equipment. It was one-third<br />\nof this amount last year, and no<br />\none will say that the team under<br />\nthe management of Coach Gill was<br />\nhampered by a lack of adequate<br />\nclothes or shoes. Then there was<br />\na little expense of $30 for a dinner<br />\nat the Belvedere.<br />\nLet it be distinctly understood<br />\nthat we are not fixing the blame<br />\nfor this, and let it be doubly clear<br />\nthat we are not criticising Manager<br />\nHaynes for the smallness of the<br />\na/mount which he turned over to<br />\nthe Board: He was not responsible<br />\nfor the expenditures. It was his<br />\nonly to pay the bills after they<br />\nwere contracted, and then to try<br />\nand save as much as he could from<br />\nthe remnants.<br />\nThe Athletic Board certainly<br />\nought here to come in for some<br />\ncriticism. They once, earlier in<br />\nthe year, foresaw the probable deficit and passed a resolution that<br />\na training table would be too heavy<br />\nan expense, and then later when it<br />\nwas again urged, rescinded action<br />\nand placed the matter in the hands<br />\nof the football authorities, who decided in favor of the free feed.<br />\nLet it bq understood that we<br />\nwouldn't begrudge a Hopkins team<br />\nContihued on page 6; col. 2.<br />\n<br />\nI<br />\n<br />\nPRICE, FIVE CENTS<br />\n<br />\nLACROSSE TEAM SEND-OFF<br />\n<br />\nHALF - MILLION MARK REACHED<br />\n<br />\nBig Meeting and Rousing Speeches Mark<br />\nBeginning of Practice\u2014All Determined to Win Championship.<br />\n<br />\nHandsome Gifts to the Hopkins' Fund<br />\nAssure Success of Campaign<br />\nin Baltimore.<br />\n<br />\nThe lacrosse season of 1911<br />\nopened on Thursday, December 8,<br />\nwhen an organization meeting was<br />\nheld in the trophy room at 5<br />\no'clock.

These questions<br />\nmight be timely.<br />\nA college education, we think<br />\neveryone will admit, ought to serve<br />\ntwo purposes\u2014to supply a man<br />\nwith a certain amount of teaching<br />\nand to fit him for life. All the<br />\nmachinery, therefore, of college<br />\neducation ought to work towards<br />\none or both of these ends. Towards which do examinations<br />\nwork, and how?<br />\nOf old, the greater part of a<br />\nman's learning, whether acquired at<br />\ncollege or elsewhere, was acquired<br />\nthrough the memory. If a man<br />\nwanted to learn Latin, he memorized Lilly's grammar. If he wanted to learn geometry, he memorized<br />\nEuclid's five books. The only<br />\nway in which a professor could<br />\njudge whether the student's memory was retaining the vast amount<br />\nof education which it swallowed<br />\ndaily was by periodical examinations. In recent years the whole<br />\ntheory of education has changed.<br />\nThe student is urged to learn<br />\nmore with his reason, and with his<br />\nmemory less. If he is learning<br />\ngeometry, he acquaints himself with<br />\nEuclid's theorems, but, instead of<br />\nmemorizing them, applies them to<br />\nthe solution of original problems.<br />\nIf he is learning Latin, he acquaints himself with the chief<br />\nrules of grammar and commences<br />\nstraightway to apply them to the<br />\nprocess of translation.<br />\nConsequently, examinations also<br />\nhave altered their character. They<br />\nconsist no longer merely of questions which require the use of the<br />\nmemory. They demand the exercise<br />\nof reason. But as a dile the conditions under which they are held<br />\nare not just those most conducive<br />\nto the exercise of reason.

The ability to<br />\nexpect an examination with complacency and endure it without<br />\nfear is a proof either of disregard<br />\nof reputation or of stolidity of<br />\ntemper. The true scholar seldom<br />\npossesses these qualities.<br />\nThe very difficulty, perhaps in<br />\nthe use of reason under the circumstances of an examination often<br />\ninduces examiners to revert to questions which require only the use<br />\nof the memory. But such a course,<br />\nbesides being a return to antiquated<br />\nstandards, gives opportunity for<br />\nthe students to use in their paper<br />\nthat very spurious kind of knowledge which can be acquired by<br />\ncramming.<br />\nBut this cramming i,tself, it is<br />\nargued, and the stolidity, or rather<br />\nfirmness, of temper necessitated by<br />\nexaminations, make them, if less<br />\ntests of acquired learning, at any<br />\nrate more perfect instruments in<br />\nthe training for life. Life is a<br />\ncompetition. Moreover there are<br />\nmany occasions when a man must<br />\nacquire for a particular occasion<br />\na great deal of knowledge for<br />\nwhich he will have no further use.<br />\nThis is quite true. But in life<br />\nthe competition is generally open.<br />\nEvery competitor has his own supporters to encourage him. He sees<br />\njust how far his opponent has gone,<br />\nand puts forth all his strength to<br />\ngo farther.<br />\nHe crams spontaneously (for after all there is so<br />\nmuch cramming done in the world<br />\nthat examinations hardly seem<br />\nnecessary to teach us how to do<br />\nit). His whole heart is in the<br />\nstruggle. He revels in it. Nobody<br />\never revelled in an examination<br />\nany more than in a secret fight<br />\nwith a panther, deep in the loneliness of a mountain cave. In.life<br />\nthe struggles are open. And it is<br />\nprobably because examinations are<br />\nnot open that the general public<br />\nadmires the man who wears an<br />\n\"H\" more than the man who wears<br />\na Phi Beta Kappa key.<br />\nExaminations evidently, therefore, possess several disadvantages<br />\nas tests of schorlarship; they possess several disadvantages as aids<br />\nin the training for life; what then<br />\ndo they accomplish in college education?

Messrs. Benjamin Tuska and Charles A. Boston,<br />\nwhose names appear prominently<br />\nin the article, are both Hopkins<br />\nalumni. To quote:<br />\nUpon the suggestion of the Educational Alliance, the New York<br />\nCounty Lawyers' Association has<br />\nundertaken to give a series of lectures and addresses on the ethical<br />\naspect of the various branches of<br />\nlaw during the coming winter. In<br />\nSeptember of this year, Xenjamin<br />\nTuska, chairman of the Law Committee of the Educational Alliance,<br />\nwrote to Charles Strauss, the secretary of the New York County Lawyers' Association, stating that if<br />\nthe latter Association would undertake to establish such a series of<br />\nlectures, the large auditorium and<br />\nthe smaller lecture halls of the Educational Alliance would be at the<br />\ndisposal of the Association for that<br />\npurpose, and that the directors of<br />\nthe Educational Alliance would be<br />\nglad to co-operate with the Association in securing attendance at such<br />\nlectures. The Board of Directors<br />\nof the New York County Lawyers'<br />\nAssociation approved of this plan,<br />\nand referred it to the Committee on<br />\nProfessional Ethics, with power to<br />\nact. This committee has taken up<br />\nthe work and is prosecuting it<br />\nthrough a suly-committee, consisting<br />\nof Charles A. Boston, chairman;<br />\nEverett V. Abbott and Edmonds<br />\nPutney. This sub-committee is acting in conjunction with the Law<br />\nCommittee of the Educational Alliance, which consists of Mr. Tuska<br />\nand Bernard M. L. Ernst, James<br />\nFrank and Louis Marshall. Messrs.<br />\nBoston, Abbot and Putney have<br />\nvolunteered to act as speakers, as<br />\nhave also the following members<br />\nof the New York County Lawyers'<br />\nAssociation: Everett P. Wheeler,<br />\nAbraham L. Gutman and Dudley<br />\nField Malone.<br />\nThe lectures are designed not for<br />\nlawyers only, but for laymen as<br />\nwell, with the idea of informing<br />\npeople in general what they, as<br />\nclients, have the right to expect of<br />\nlawyers in the way of protecting<br />\ntheir interests.<br />\n<br />\nA series of athletic and gviniiastic<br />\ncontests between the members of<br />\nthe freshman class will be held,<br />\nbeginning immediately after the<br />\nChristmas holidays. Mr. Kistler<br />\nand the freshmen at a meeting held<br />\nlast week, decided to divide the<br />\nclass into two sides, called the<br />\nBlues and the Whites, after the<br />\nclass colors. Silver medals will be<br />\ngiven to all the members of the<br />\nwinning side, and individual prizes<br />\nwill be given to the three highest<br />\npoint winners, irrespective of side.<br />\nW. D. Sutton was chosen captain<br />\nof the Blues, with Harold L. Steibel<br />\nand George E. Dorsey as assistants.<br />\nStewart White was made leader of<br />\nthe Whites, with Lawrence Getz<br />\nand W. R. Everton, assistants. Mr.<br />\nKistler is now holding a series of<br />\npreliminary contests, so as to give<br />\nthe captains some idea of the ability<br />\nof the various members of the class<br />\nbefore they choose their sides.<br />\nThere will be twenty different<br />\nevents and they may be repeated<br />\nonce or more before the season is<br />\nover. Every contestant will have an<br />\nopportunity to win some points for<br />\nhis side, as for instance, the number of times a contestant \"chins\"<br />\nor \"dips\" counts so many points<br />\nfor his side. In the other events,<br />\nthe first six places will count 10, 8,<br />\n6, 4, 2, and I points, respectively.<br />\nThe freshmen intend to challenge<br />\nthe juniors to a dual meet sometime<br />\nnext spring. The freshman team<br />\nwill probably be composed of the<br />\nfifteen highest point winners at the<br />\ntime of the challenge.<br />\nHopkins Has a Half-notable Scientist.<br />\n<br />\nJohns Hopkins Press<br />\nI.\u2014American Journal of Mathematics.<br />\nF.

Alumni especially are urged<br />\nto make use of this column.)<br />\nTo the Editor of THE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\n<br />\nDEAR SIR:\u2014I consider that the<br />\n<br />\ngiving of the \"H's\" this year by<br />\nthe Athletic Board was the rankest<br />\ninjustice and the worst case of<br />\nbootlicking that I have seen around<br />\nthe University in a long time.<br />\nPersonally I cannot conceive on<br />\nwhat ground they could possibly<br />\ncall it fair to award an \"H\" to<br />\nJack, who played only 21 minutes<br />\nin the Haverford game, and fortyfive minutes in the St. Johns game,<br />\nand not to Paulus and Tappan who<br />\nplayed a part of every game during<br />\nthe season.<br />\nIt seems to me that having an<br />\nunusual condition on one hand,<br />\nnamely\u2014men playing who have<br />\nalready played four years at other<br />\ncolleges, it must be counterbalanced<br />\nby something on the other hand ;<br />\nthat is, recompense in some way the<br />\nmen whose places they have taken.<br />\nThat is the undergraduates should<br />\nalso have an \"H\" who in the natural<br />\norder of things would have had<br />\npositions if it hadn't been for the<br />\nmedical men.<br />\nAnother thing that has to be taken<br />\ninto account is that under the new<br />\nrules, when a man can go back into<br />\nthe game again, it is almost an<br />\nabsolute necessity for a team to<br />\nhave twd sets of backs\u2014let alone<br />\nthe other positions\u2014neither of<br />\nwhich could be considered substitute.<br />\nAnd lastly I think there is a condition which will become more<br />\nnoticeable next year. That is, in<br />\nthe natural order of things, a man<br />\nwho has played three years on the<br />\nscrub and as substitute, would if<br />\nhe were any good at all, make the<br />\nvarsity the next year simply due<br />\nto the amount of coaching that he<br />\nhas had, if nothing else.<br />\nFor instance in an ordinary college, say eight men come out in<br />\ntheir freshmen year, six will survive to the second year, four to the<br />\nthird, and three to the fourth, all<br />\nthree of whom should make the varsity that year. While here under<br />\nthe present conditions, it doesn't do<br />\na man any good to be the senior<br />\ncandidate for the position and have<br />\npracticed for that position for three<br />\nyears, for new medical men will<br />\nbe brought out each year, who will<br />\nget the position quite as much on<br />\naccount of the prestige accorded<br />\nthem as coming from the medical<br />\nschool as for their playing abilities.<br />\nTherefore it will not take more<br />\nthan two years for the scrub team<br />\nto dwindle to the freshman candidates only, as nobody would come<br />\nout a number of years in succession<br />\nwhen there would be no chance<br />\nfor him on the varsity.<br />\nThank you for the space accorded me in publishing this.<br />\n<br />\nSTUDENT.<br />\n<br />\nSTRATTON<br />\n<br />\n5<br />\n<br />\nShirt Maker<br />\n$9.00<br />\n10.50<br />\n13.50<br />\n<br />\n6 Full Dress Shirts<br />\n6 Madras Shirts<br />\n6 Madras Shirts.<br />\n<br />\nA Full Line of Men's Furnishings<br />\nOpposite<br />\nRENNERT HOTEL<br />\n<br />\nR.

It was announced Saturday<br />\nthat a student mass meeting will<br />\nbe held one day this week in order<br />\nto discuss the problem.<br />\nThe crisis in the financial affairs<br />\nof the Association was caused by<br />\nthe fact that the football season<br />\nnetted only one-twelfth of what it<br />\ndid last season. As football is the<br />\nbest paying sport at Hopkins, it<br />\nhas to be relied on to help the other<br />\nteams out. Three hundred dollars<br />\n(or less) will be turned over to<br />\nTreasurer Stewart. by Manager<br />\nHaynes. From this $300 must be<br />\nsubtracted $175 advanced by the<br />\nboard, leaving about $roo clear.<br />\nLast year the amount turned over<br />\nwas $1,400.<br />\nIf the Board had no obligations<br />\nother than those of financing the<br />\nteams, the problem would be a<br />\ncomparatively simple one. But<br />\nthere are two magnificent stands<br />\nat Homewood which the Association is expected to pay for. The<br />\nCost of each was about $8,000, and<br />\nif $1,500 could be turned over<br />\nevery year, as was the case last<br />\nseason, the whole $16,00o would<br />\nsoon be wiped out.<br />\nTo do the best it can, and to at<br />\nleast pay the interest on the cost<br />\nof the second stand and something<br />\ntoward the sinking fund, the Athletic Association is morally obligated. The proposition was made<br />\nto the trustees of the University<br />\nlast spring to put up the second<br />\nstand, as it was thought that it<br />\nwould be paying venture and that<br />\nthe added proceeds from the games<br /><br />\nit<br /><br />\nBALTIMORE, MD., DECEMBER 12, 1910.<br />\nwould in a short time pay for it.<br />\nThe trustees on account of the fact<br />\nthat they had a fair deficit to<br />\ndeal with, did not at first take<br />\nkindly to the proposal of going<br />\nfarther in debt. Mr. Blanchard<br />\nRandall, however, was in favor of<br />\nit. He had had the case presented<br />\nto him by a committee of the alumni, and the trustees allowed him<br />\nto go ahead. The understanding<br />\nwas, however, that the Athletic<br />\nAssociation was to pay the interest<br />\nand somethingon the principal. This<br />\naccording to present prospects they<br />\nwill be unable to do, and the Board<br />\nwill be forced to tell the trustees<br />\nthat because football didn't pay,<br />\nvery little can be paid on account<br />\nof the two concrete stands.<br />\nNow, why didn't football pay?<br />\nThere certainly were larger crowds<br />\nthan last year, except at the St.<br />\nJohn's game. The gross receipts<br />\nwere $2,opo greater. The team<br />\nwas better than ever before.<br />\nOf course, we are fully aware<br />\nthat the team had to pay $850 more<br />\nfor coaches than was the case last<br />\nyear when the alumni footed the<br />\nlarger part of the bill. But leaving<br />\nthis out of consideration, there<br />\nought to have been a larger net gain<br />\nthan $100. Nearly $500 was expended on a training table, which<br />\nvaluable as it may be, used up half<br />\na thousand dollars, which would<br />\nhave more than paid the interest<br />\non one stand.<br />\nThen there is the item of $900<br />\nfor equipment. It was one-third<br />\nof this amount last year, and no<br />\none will say that the team under<br />\nthe management of Coach Gill was<br />\nhampered by a lack of adequate<br />\nclothes or shoes. Then there was<br />\na little expense of $30 for a dinner<br />\nat the Belvedere.<br />\nLet it be distinctly understood<br />\nthat we are not fixing the blame<br />\nfor this, and let it be doubly clear<br />\nthat we are not criticising Manager<br />\nHaynes for the smallness of the<br />\na/mount which he turned over to<br />\nthe Board: He was not responsible<br />\nfor the expenditures. It was his<br />\nonly to pay the bills after they<br />\nwere contracted, and then to try<br />\nand save as much as he could from<br />\nthe remnants.<br />\nThe Athletic Board certainly<br />\nought here to come in for some<br />\ncriticism. They once, earlier in<br />\nthe year, foresaw the probable deficit and passed a resolution that<br />\na training table would be too heavy<br />\nan expense, and then later when it<br />\nwas again urged, rescinded action<br />\nand placed the matter in the hands<br />\nof the football authorities, who decided in favor of the free feed.<br />\nLet it bq understood that we<br />\nwouldn't begrudge a Hopkins team<br />\nContihued on page 6; col. 2.<br /><br />\nI<br /><br />\nPRICE, FIVE CENTS<br /><br />\nLACROSSE TEAM SEND-OFF<br /><br />\nHALF - MILLION MARK REACHED<br /><br />\nBig Meeting and Rousing Speeches Mark<br />\nBeginning of Practice\u2014All Determined to Win Championship.<br /><br />\nHandsome Gifts to the Hopkins' Fund<br />\nAssure Success of Campaign<br />\nin Baltimore.<br /><br />\nThe lacrosse season of 1911<br />\nopened on Thursday, December 8,<br />\nwhen an organization meeting was<br />\nheld in the trophy room at 5<br />\no'clock.

What part do they play in<br />\nsuch an education? Why have we<br />\ncome to look upon them as inseparable therefrom? These questions<br />\nmight be timely.<br />\nA college education, we think<br />\neveryone will admit, ought to serve<br />\ntwo purposes\u2014to supply a man<br />\nwith a certain amount of teaching<br />\nand to fit him for life. All the<br />\nmachinery, therefore, of college<br />\neducation ought to work towards<br />\none or both of these ends. Towards which do examinations<br />\nwork, and how?<br />\nOf old, the greater part of a<br />\nman's learning, whether acquired at<br />\ncollege or elsewhere, was acquired<br />\nthrough the memory. If a man<br />\nwanted to learn Latin, he memorized Lilly's grammar. If he wanted to learn geometry, he memorized<br />\nEuclid's five books. The only<br />\nway in which a professor could<br />\njudge whether the student's memory was retaining the vast amount<br />\nof education which it swallowed<br />\ndaily was by periodical examinations. In recent years the whole<br />\ntheory of education has changed.<br />\nThe student is urged to learn<br />\nmore with his reason, and with his<br />\nmemory less. If he is learning<br />\ngeometry, he acquaints himself with<br />\nEuclid's theorems, but, instead of<br />\nmemorizing them, applies them to<br />\nthe solution of original problems.<br />\nIf he is learning Latin, he acquaints himself with the chief<br />\nrules of grammar and commences<br />\nstraightway to apply them to the<br />\nprocess of translation.<br />\nConsequently, examinations also<br />\nhave altered their character. They<br />\nconsist no longer merely of questions which require the use of the<br />\nmemory. They demand the exercise<br />\nof reason. But as a dile the conditions under which they are held<br />\nare not just those most conducive<br />\nto the exercise of reason.

The ability to<br />\nexpect an examination with complacency and endure it without<br />\nfear is a proof either of disregard<br />\nof reputation or of stolidity of<br />\ntemper. The true scholar seldom<br />\npossesses these qualities.<br />\nThe very difficulty, perhaps in<br />\nthe use of reason under the circumstances of an examination often<br />\ninduces examiners to revert to questions which require only the use<br />\nof the memory. But such a course,<br />\nbesides being a return to antiquated<br />\nstandards, gives opportunity for<br />\nthe students to use in their paper<br />\nthat very spurious kind of knowledge which can be acquired by<br />\ncramming.<br />\nBut this cramming i,tself, it is<br />\nargued, and the stolidity, or rather<br />\nfirmness, of temper necessitated by<br />\nexaminations, make them, if less<br />\ntests of acquired learning, at any<br />\nrate more perfect instruments in<br />\nthe training for life. Life is a<br />\ncompetition. Moreover there are<br />\nmany occasions when a man must<br />\nacquire for a particular occasion<br />\na great deal of knowledge for<br />\nwhich he will have no further use.<br />\nThis is quite true. But in life<br />\nthe competition is generally open.<br />\nEvery competitor has his own supporters to encourage him. He sees<br />\njust how far his opponent has gone,<br />\nand puts forth all his strength to<br />\ngo farther.<br />\nHe crams spontaneously (for after all there is so<br />\nmuch cramming done in the world<br />\nthat examinations hardly seem<br />\nnecessary to teach us how to do<br />\nit). His whole heart is in the<br />\nstruggle. He revels in it. Nobody<br />\never revelled in an examination<br />\nany more than in a secret fight<br />\nwith a panther, deep in the loneliness of a mountain cave. In.life<br />\nthe struggles are open. And it is<br />\nprobably because examinations are<br />\nnot open that the general public<br />\nadmires the man who wears an<br />\n\"H\" more than the man who wears<br />\na Phi Beta Kappa key.<br />\nExaminations evidently, therefore, possess several disadvantages<br />\nas tests of schorlarship; they possess several disadvantages as aids<br />\nin the training for life; what then<br />\ndo they accomplish in college education?

Messrs. Benjamin Tuska and Charles A. Boston,<br />\nwhose names appear prominently<br />\nin the article, are both Hopkins<br />\nalumni. To quote:<br />\nUpon the suggestion of the Educational Alliance, the New York<br />\nCounty Lawyers' Association has<br />\nundertaken to give a series of lectures and addresses on the ethical<br />\naspect of the various branches of<br />\nlaw during the coming winter. In<br />\nSeptember of this year, Xenjamin<br />\nTuska, chairman of the Law Committee of the Educational Alliance,<br />\nwrote to Charles Strauss, the secretary of the New York County Lawyers' Association, stating that if<br />\nthe latter Association would undertake to establish such a series of<br />\nlectures, the large auditorium and<br />\nthe smaller lecture halls of the Educational Alliance would be at the<br />\ndisposal of the Association for that<br />\npurpose, and that the directors of<br />\nthe Educational Alliance would be<br />\nglad to co-operate with the Association in securing attendance at such<br />\nlectures. The Board of Directors<br />\nof the New York County Lawyers'<br />\nAssociation approved of this plan,<br />\nand referred it to the Committee on<br />\nProfessional Ethics, with power to<br />\nact. This committee has taken up<br />\nthe work and is prosecuting it<br />\nthrough a suly-committee, consisting<br />\nof Charles A. Boston, chairman;<br />\nEverett V. Abbott and Edmonds<br />\nPutney. This sub-committee is acting in conjunction with the Law<br />\nCommittee of the Educational Alliance, which consists of Mr. Tuska<br />\nand Bernard M. L. Ernst, James<br />\nFrank and Louis Marshall. Messrs.<br />\nBoston, Abbot and Putney have<br />\nvolunteered to act as speakers, as<br />\nhave also the following members<br />\nof the New York County Lawyers'<br />\nAssociation: Everett P. Wheeler,<br />\nAbraham L. Gutman and Dudley<br />\nField Malone.<br />\nThe lectures are designed not for<br />\nlawyers only, but for laymen as<br />\nwell, with the idea of informing<br />\npeople in general what they, as<br />\nclients, have the right to expect of<br />\nlawyers in the way of protecting<br />\ntheir interests.<br /><br />\nA series of athletic and gviniiastic<br />\ncontests between the members of<br />\nthe freshman class will be held,<br />\nbeginning immediately after the<br />\nChristmas holidays. Mr. Kistler<br />\nand the freshmen at a meeting held<br />\nlast week, decided to divide the<br />\nclass into two sides, called the<br />\nBlues and the Whites, after the<br />\nclass colors. Silver medals will be<br />\ngiven to all the members of the<br />\nwinning side, and individual prizes<br />\nwill be given to the three highest<br />\npoint winners, irrespective of side.<br />\nW. D. Sutton was chosen captain<br />\nof the Blues, with Harold L. Steibel<br />\nand George E. Dorsey as assistants.<br />\nStewart White was made leader of<br />\nthe Whites, with Lawrence Getz<br />\nand W. R. Everton, assistants. Mr.<br />\nKistler is now holding a series of<br />\npreliminary contests, so as to give<br />\nthe captains some idea of the ability<br />\nof the various members of the class<br />\nbefore they choose their sides.<br />\nThere will be twenty different<br />\nevents and they may be repeated<br />\nonce or more before the season is<br />\nover. Every contestant will have an<br />\nopportunity to win some points for<br />\nhis side, as for instance, the number of times a contestant \"chins\"<br />\nor \"dips\" counts so many points<br />\nfor his side. In the other events,<br />\nthe first six places will count 10, 8,<br />\n6, 4, 2, and I points, respectively.<br />\nThe freshmen intend to challenge<br />\nthe juniors to a dual meet sometime<br />\nnext spring.

Alumni especially are urged<br />\nto make use of this column.)<br />\nTo the Editor of THE NEWS-LETTER.<br /><br />\nDEAR SIR:\u2014I consider that the<br /><br />\ngiving of the \"H's\" this year by<br />\nthe Athletic Board was the rankest<br />\ninjustice and the worst case of<br />\nbootlicking that I have seen around<br />\nthe University in a long time.<br />\nPersonally I cannot conceive on<br />\nwhat ground they could possibly<br />\ncall it fair to award an \"H\" to<br />\nJack, who played only 21 minutes<br />\nin the Haverford game, and fortyfive minutes in the St. Johns game,<br />\nand not to Paulus and Tappan who<br />\nplayed a part of every game during<br />\nthe season.<br />\nIt seems to me that having an<br />\nunusual condition on one hand,<br />\nnamely\u2014men playing who have<br />\nalready played four years at other<br />\ncolleges, it must be counterbalanced<br />\nby something on the other hand ;<br />\nthat is, recompense in some way the<br />\nmen whose places they have taken.<br />\nThat is the undergraduates should<br />\nalso have an \"H\" who in the natural<br />\norder of things would have had<br />\npositions if it hadn't been for the<br />\nmedical men.<br />\nAnother thing that has to be taken<br />\ninto account is that under the new<br />\nrules, when a man can go back into<br />\nthe game again, it is almost an<br />\nabsolute necessity for a team to<br />\nhave twd sets of backs\u2014let alone<br />\nthe other positions\u2014neither of<br />\nwhich could be considered substitute.<br />\nAnd lastly I think there is a condition which will become more<br />\nnoticeable next year. That is, in<br />\nthe natural order of things, a man<br />\nwho has played three years on the<br />\nscrub and as substitute, would if<br />\nhe were any good at all, make the<br />\nvarsity the next year simply due<br />\nto the amount of coaching that he<br />\nhas had, if nothing else.<br />\nFor instance in an ordinary college, say eight men come out in<br />\ntheir freshmen year, six will survive to the second year, four to the<br />\nthird, and three to the fourth, all<br />\nthree of whom should make the varsity that year. While here under<br />\nthe present conditions, it doesn't do<br />\na man any good to be the senior<br />\ncandidate for the position and have<br />\npracticed for that position for three<br />\nyears, for new medical men will<br />\nbe brought out each year, who will<br />\nget the position quite as much on<br />\naccount of the prestige accorded<br />\nthem as coming from the medical<br />\nschool as for their playing abilities.<br />\nTherefore it will not take more<br />\nthan two years for the scrub team<br />\nto dwindle to the freshman candidates only, as nobody would come<br />\nout a number of years in succession<br />\nwhen there would be no chance<br />\nfor him on the varsity.<br />\nThank you for the space accorded me in publishing this.<br /><br />\nSTUDENT.<br /><br />\nSTRATTON<br /><br />\n5<br /><br />\nShirt Maker<br />\n$9.00<br />\n10.50<br />\n13.50<br /><br />\n6 Full Dress Shirts<br />\n6 Madras Shirts<br />\n6 Madras Shirts.<br /><br />\nA Full Line of Men's Furnishings<br />\nOpposite<br />\nRENNERT HOTEL<br /><br />\nR.
