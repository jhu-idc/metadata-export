CATES.<br />\n<br />\nRecently published statistics on student attendance at our leading colleges<br />\nare more notable because of certain<br />\nnecessary conclusions omitted than for<br />\ninferences plainly intended to be drawn.<br />\nThe figures are overwhelmingly convincing when quantity alone is considered. When we.attempt to evaluate university powers for administrating to the<br />\nadvancement of civilization\u2014the primal<br />\npurpose for which these institutions are<br />\nestablished\u2014naked quantity is the one<br />\nfactor of all which we should most wish<br />\nto forget.

From institutions<br />\nhaving the highest number of students,<br />\nwhere the figures reach nearly 10,000,<br />\nthere is graduated precedence down to<br />\nthe thirtieth and last worth mentioning<br />\nschool. This last listed school becomes<br />\n\u2022 especially conspicUous because of the<br />\nfact that its place is last.<br />\nThe attendance table mentioned might<br />\nhave placed even greater emphasis on<br />\nthe quantity feature. Only the two hundred odd graduate students of this<br />\nthirtieth and last listed institution might<br />\nhave been taken into account and this<br />\nthirtieth school would then be made to<br />\nassume the role of the tail-ender among<br />\n400 colleges of the land. But it is in<br />\nthis small body of students that lies<br />\nthe very essence of that quality of mental aptitude to which special attention<br />\nis here directed, and which is entirely<br />\noverlooked in the comparison.<br />\nNow it so happens that we have some<br />\nvery exact figures by which to express<br />\nthe quality of American intellectuality.<br />\n'They are far more reliable than any statistics which relate to mere numbers,<br />\nbecause of the fact that they represent<br />\n-the mature .and composite opinion of<br />\nour most eminent scientific minds. It<br />\nis well known how, by the one hundred<br />\nauthorities in science, there were selected the names of f,000 men most<br />\n,distinguished in the several branches of<br />\nknowledge; and how this list was resently published by Professor J.

He was of<br />\nHuguenot stock and inherited, perhaps from remote ancestors who<br />\nwere directors of music at the courts<br />\nof Charles I and of Charles II, a<br />\nrare gift for music. His education<br />\nwas obtained at Oglethorpe College, Georgia, where he graduated<br />\nand served as a tutor for one year<br />\nbefore he and practically all of the<br />\ncollege entered the Confederate<br />\nArmy. During the war he served<br />\nas a scout and as a signal officer on<br />\na blockade runner until he was<br />\nmade a prisoner of war and suffered an imprisonment of several<br />\nmonths and a lasting injury to his<br />\nhealth.<br />\nAfter the war he taught school<br />\nand studied law, practicing with his<br />\nTHE HOUSE AT LYNN, N.

To him poetry was a<br />\nmeans for the expression of his<br />\nmusical nature \u2014and in all his<br />\nverses the rhythm and beauty of<br />\nthe song are to be found, rather<br />\nthan didacticism. He was of no<br />\nliterary school; his poetry was the<br />\nnatural expression of his inner self.<br />\nThe flute was the instrument<br />\nwhich Lanier chose as his own, and<br />\nhe was a skillful player. According to Frederick H. Gottlieb, he<br />\nwas one of the greatest virtuosos in<br />\nAmerica. When Karl Wehner,<br />\namong the foremost flute players in<br />\nthe world at that time, visited Baltimore he was taken to Lanier by<br />\nMr. Gottlieb and was so enthused<br />\nby his playing and by the charm of<br />\nthe man himself that he afterward<br />\nsaid that never before had a human<br />\nbeing made such a profound impression upon him.<br />\nIt was this personal charm which<br />\nmade Lanier such a unique figure<br />\namong the poets of his time. Of a<br />\ntrue poetical improvidence, utterly<br />\nabsorbed in his intellectual and musical work, making no plans or provisions other than for the immediate present, he preserved even in<br />\nthe direct financial and physical<br />\nstraits a gentleness, a kindness, a<br />\nkeen appreciation of all that was<br />\nbeautiful. According to those who<br />\nknew him, he was a man whose<br />\nonly fault was an Idealism of too<br />\nlofty a character to equip him for<br />\nworldly battles.<br />\nLike all dreamers, he planned and<br />\nhoped for things which never became realities. Thus his life was<br />\na series of disappointments, but in<br />\nthese he never became bitter, never<br />\ngave over to despair. In regarding<br />\nthe unfulfilled hopes of his life, he<br />\nshowed only a pathetic sorrow, a<br />\nchildlike grief, as when in a letter<br />\nto his wife,, written shortly after<br />\ncoming to Baltimore, he said:<br />\n\"So many great ideas for Art are<br />\nborn to me each day, I am swept<br />\naway into the land of all-delight by<br />\ntheir strenuous, sweet whirlwind;<br />\nand I find within myself such entire,<br />\nyet humble, confidence in possessing every single element of power<br />\nto carry them all out, save the little<br />\npaltry sum of money that would<br />\nsuffice to keep us clothed and fed<br />\nin the meantime. I do not understand this.\"<br />\nIn addition to his financial tribulations was the sorrow which he<br />\nfelt in the fact that his poetic melody was not fully appreciated by his<br />\ncontemporaries. But he was beloved of all who knew him, and<br />\nreverenced by those lovers of music<br />\nwho could feel his worth. Yet,<br />\nuntil his death, the chivalry and<br />\ndignity which he inherited from<br />\nGeorgia did not lessen. Once,<br />\nwhen, during his connection with<br />\nthe Peabody Orchestra, the leader<br />\nduring practice made an insulting<br />\n<br />\nremark, Lanier, his eyes afire with<br />\nindignation, stepped forward, his<br />\nbent and broken frame already far<br />\nwasted away, and demanded an<br />\napology, and not until the leader<br />\napologized before the assembled<br />\norchestra would he continue to play.<br />\nPOETRY AND MUSIC HIS PASSIONS<br />\n(Continued from page S.)<br />\n<br />\nA bronze bust of the poet stands<br />\nin the Donovan Room, a tablet to<br />\nhis memory is on its walls, and in<br />\nthe possession of the University are<br />\nmany of his letters and autographed<br />\npoems.

Heretofore, two men\u2014a graduate and an<br />\nundergraduate student\u2014have taken<br />\nthe entire responsibility of the management of the clubs, with only<br />\nmoderate success. Last year the<br />\nChristmas trip proved a financial<br />\nfailure, and most of the smaller<br />\nchurch concerts given in Baltimore were also failures. The men<br />\nshowed no enthusiasm after the<br />\ntrips had been taken and only a<br />\nsmall percentage of the membership<br />\ntook part in the church concerts.<br />\nIt is thought that the risks can be<br />\nbetter calculated and the schedule<br />\nmore advantageously arranged by<br />\na board of managers. All the other<br />\nstudent activities are in the hands<br />\nof boards and the Musical Clubs<br />\nare going to try a similar system.<br />\nThe board of managers will probably be made up of five members\u2014<br />\nthe president, the two leaders and<br />\nthe two managers\u2014one of whom<br />\nwill also act as treasurer. All important matters will be carefully<br />\nconsidered and voted upon by the<br />\nboard. A committee has been appointed to draw up a definite code<br />\nof rules governing the exact powers and duties of this board, along<br />\nthe lines worked out by the originators of the plan, and its report<br />\nwill be acted upon at the next meeting. The older men consider this<br />\na critical period in the life of the<br />\nclubs, as the management has lost<br />\nmoney during the last two years,<br />\nand there have been rumors of<br />\nabandoning this activity on the<br />\nground that it does not pay.

Baker, Jr., '15, president of the Student Council, has resigned from the Athletic Board. One<br />\nof the requirements for membership<br />\non the Council is that the incumbent<br />\nshall not be a member of the Athletic Board, and since Baker was<br />\nelected to both, he chose to serve<br />\nthe Student Council.<br />\nMyron E. Bagley also was electto the two positions, but will resign<br />\nfrom the Student Council.<br />\nThus, the Athletic Board will<br />\nhave to choose a successor to Baker, and the Junior Class will be required to elect another delegate to<br />\nthe Council.<br />\n<br />\nfor<br />\n<br />\n30<br />\n20<br />\n<br />\nto<br />\n23<br />\n0<br />\n20<br />\n<br />\n25<br />\n25<br />\n31<br />\n8<br />\n55<br />\n6o<br />\n<br />\nDuring the next generation, in spite<br />\nof loud prediction to the contrary, these<br />\npercentages will probably increase rather<br />\nthan diminish. The first generation of<br />\nHopkins men is yet in its prime. In<br />\na remarkable way it is copiously and<br />\ncreatively productive. Over all American competitors it has the start of 20<br />\nyears. Whether in the third generation<br />\nthere may be a falling off is a matter<br />\nof conjecture. It depends upon several<br />\nfactors. The growth of the graduate<br />\nschool in the larger universities and in<br />\nthe state universities is an essential element, but not a disturbing one so long<br />\nas college and university are reared side<br />\nby side, and college spirit submerges and<br />\nsmothers university soul.<br />\nThus is one-fourth of all the master<br />\nminds in American science a direct<br />\nproduct of Johns Hopkins influence.

The figures have been tabulated as follows:<br />\nENROLLMENT Or STUDENTS.<br /><br />\nSophomores and freshmen are<br />\nalready making arrangements for<br />\ntheir inter-class games.<br />\nThe annual football. contest,<br />\nwhich was cancelled last year, will<br />\nbe played this fall. Although a<br />\ndate for the game has not been announced, it will, in all probability,<br />\nbe on November 29, the Saturday<br />\nfollowing the Hopkins-St. John's<br />\ngame.<br />\nAt its last meeting, the sophomore class began its preparation<br />\nby unanimously electing Howard<br />\nGorman to captain the 1917 squad.<br />\nThe following are candidates: Baxley, Steinbach, A Ierrick, Twigg,<br />\nBrooks, Thomas, E. L. Smith,<br />\nStraus. Frank, Stuart, I-Tall, Fulton, Binford and Gorman.<br />\nThe usual regulations must be<br />\nobserved by all men who expect to<br />\nparticipate in the game. Each candidate must take a physical examination under Dr. Abercrombie, who<br />\nwill determine the candidate's fitness to play. In addition, each<br />\nplayer must have had at least two<br />\nWeeks' practice prior to the date of<br />\nthe game.<br />\nIt has been authoritatively stated<br />\nthat there will be no pushball concontest this year.<br />\nIn previous years the cane-rush<br />\nhas been held during the intermission between the halves of the<br />\nclass football game, and it is hoped<br />\nthis tradition may be revived. The<br />\ntrack meet, lacrosse and baseball<br />\ngames may be expected as usual in<br />\nthe spring.<br />\nProspects for the freshman football team are very bright at the<br />\npresent time. Eleven freshmen are<br />\non the 'Varsity squad, five of whom<br />\nhave played in both games of the<br />\n'Varsity schedule. Three or four<br />\nmen who are not on the squad are'<br />\ncoming out for the freshman team.<br />\nAll of these men are wearers of<br />\ntheir prep school's letters. The<br />\n.team wants to arrange games with<br />\nthe various prep schools around<br />\nBaltimore. The important game of<br />\nthe year, however, will be that with<br />\nthe sophomores.<br />\nThose who are candidates for the<br />\nteam are: Backs\u2014Hoffman, Mealy,<br />\nDuncan, Connolly, Ellicott; linemen\u2014Randall, I-Currough, Yewell,<br />\nR. Woodward, Sullivan, Layfield;<br />\nends\u2014Edgerton and Ewing.<br /><br />\nBy COACH JOHN M. CATES.<br /><br />\nRecently published statistics on student attendance at our leading colleges<br />\nare more notable because of certain<br />\nnecessary conclusions omitted than for<br />\ninferences plainly intended to be drawn.<br />\nThe figures are overwhelmingly convincing when quantity alone is considered. When we.attempt to evaluate university powers for administrating to the<br />\nadvancement of civilization\u2014the primal<br />\npurpose for which these institutions are<br />\nestablished\u2014naked quantity is the one<br />\nfactor of all which we should most wish<br />\nto forget. Quality is the feature which<br />\nought to be most assiduously cultivated.<br />\nIt is not what goes into the mill, but<br />\nwhat comes out of it, that counts.<br />\nIn this last conspectus of attendance,<br />\nfor example, thirty American universities are considered. From institutions<br />\nhaving the highest number of students,<br />\nwhere the figures reach nearly 10,000,<br />\nthere is graduated precedence down to<br />\nthe thirtieth and last worth mentioning<br />\nschool. This last listed school becomes<br />\n\u2022 especially conspicUous because of the<br />\nfact that its place is last.<br />\nThe attendance table mentioned might<br />\nhave placed even greater emphasis on<br />\nthe quantity feature. Only the two hundred odd graduate students of this<br />\nthirtieth and last listed institution might<br />\nhave been taken into account and this<br />\nthirtieth school would then be made to<br />\nassume the role of the tail-ender among<br />\n400 colleges of the land. But it is in<br />\nthis small body of students that lies<br />\nthe very essence of that quality of mental aptitude to which special attention<br />\nis here directed, and which is entirely<br />\noverlooked in the comparison.<br />\nNow it so happens that we have some<br />\nvery exact figures by which to express<br />\nthe quality of American intellectuality.<br />\n'They are far more reliable than any statistics which relate to mere numbers,<br />\nbecause of the fact that they represent<br />\n-the mature .and composite opinion of<br />\nour most eminent scientific minds. It<br />\nis well known how, by the one hundred<br />\nauthorities in science, there were selected the names of f,000 men most<br />\n,distinguished in the several branches of<br />\nknowledge; and how this list was resently published by Professor J. McKeen Cattell.<br />\nAmong the thousand American men<br />\nof science who have become during their<br />\ngeneration especially distinguished, who<br />\nhave maintained themselves as leading<br />\nfigures in advanced thought of the nation, and who have acquired something<br />\nof an international reputation let us<br />\n'briefly trace the spell of the last and<br />\nthirtieth school \u2014 The Johns Hopkins<br />\nUniversity.

Of the chief American poets, Bryant<br />\nbelongs to Williams College, Longfellow to Bowdoin and<br />\nHarvard, Emerson, Holmes and Lowell to Harvard, Poe to<br />\nthe University of Virginia, Whittier and Whitman were not<br />\ncollege men in any sense, and Lanier is the poet of Johns<br />\nHopkins.<br />\nIn order that we may not forget these facts and to recall<br />\nLanier's service to the University The News-Letter publishes<br />\nin this issue one of the poet's most characteristic lyrics and<br />\nsome brief sketches of his life.<br /><br />\nLanier was born in Macon, Ga.,<br />\nOn February 3, 1842. He was of<br />\nHuguenot stock and inherited, perhaps from remote ancestors who<br />\nwere directors of music at the courts<br />\nof Charles I and of Charles II, a<br />\nrare gift for music. His education<br />\nwas obtained at Oglethorpe College, Georgia, where he graduated<br />\nand served as a tutor for one year<br />\nbefore he and practically all of the<br />\ncollege entered the Confederate<br />\nArmy. During the war he served<br />\nas a scout and as a signal officer on<br />\na blockade runner until he was<br />\nmade a prisoner of war and suffered an imprisonment of several<br />\nmonths and a lasting injury to his<br />\nhealth.<br />\nAfter the war he taught school<br />\nand studied law, practicing with his<br />\nTHE HOUSE AT LYNN, N.

His<br />\nliterary ability was encouraged by<br />\nfriends like Bayard Taylor, and in<br />\n1876 he was invited to write the<br />\nwords for the centennial cantata for<br />\nthe exposition at Philadelphia to<br />\nmusic composed by Dudley Buck.<br />\nA year later a volume of poems appeared.<br />\nIn 1879 he was made lecturer on<br />\nEnglish literature at Johns Hopkins University, where he delivered<br />\ncourses afterwards published as<br />\n\"The Science of English Verse\"<br />\nand \"The English Novel.\"<br />\nHis years in Baltimore, however,<br />\nwere a constant struggle against declining health, and he was obliged<br />\nfrom time to time to recuperate in<br />\nFlorida and in other favorable<br />\nThe second summer after coming to Johns Hopkins Lanier went to this<br />\nregions.

He caught<br />\ntheir spirit, and grew with them into<br />\na real sense of the ideals of University work. His poem written<br />\non the fourth anniversary<br />\nof the opening of the University indicates the great<br />\nlove that he had for the institution:<br />\n'How tall among her sisters,<br />\nand how fair,\u2014<br />\nHow grave beyond her youth,<br />\nyet debonair<br />\nAs dawn<br />\nHas she, old learning's latest<br />\ndaughter, won<br />\nThis grace, this stature, and<br />\nthis fruitful fame.'\"<br /><br />\nThe writer begins the<br />\nchapter by making mention<br />\nof the long friendship that<br />\nhad existed between Lanier<br />\nand the late President Gilman, and then tells of the<br />\npoet's first attempts to become connected with the<br />\nUniversity.

He not only tried<br />\nto keep in touch with all the literature dealing with problems in which<br />\nhe was particularly interested, but<br />\nalso consulted men living in Baltimore who had the special information that he desired. While writing the \"Science of English Verse\"<br />\nhe often talked with Professor Gildersleeve as to Greek metrics. \"We<br />\nnever became intimate,\" says the<br />\nlatter, \"and yet we were good<br />\nfriends and there was much common ground.

These are a good fire<br />\nand good music, and, inasmuch as<br />\nwe can do without a fire for half<br />\nthe year, I may say music is the<br />\none essential. Late explorers say<br />\nthey have found some nations that<br />\nhave no God, but I have not read<br />\nof any that have no music. Music<br />\nmeans harmony, harmony means<br />\nlove, love means God.\"<br />\nIB<br /><br />\nGerman Student Figures.<br /><br />\nDuring the year 1913-14 the<br />\ntwenty-one universities of now warring Germany enrolled the enormous total of 60,943 students, a<br />\nnumber almost exactly double that<br />\nof twenty years ago. It includes<br />\n4,117 female students. Only about<br />\n5,000 of the number studying in<br />\nGermany are foreigners. The most<br />\npopular departments are philosophy, medicine and law. The University of Berlin is the largest, with<br />\na total of 8,538 students, Munich<br />\nfollows with 6,626, Leipsic has<br />\n5,359, and Bonn, Freiburg, Halle,<br />\nGottingen, Heidelberg and Jena follow in order.<br /><br />\nSidney Lanier was essentially a<br />\nmusician. To him poetry was a<br />\nmeans for the expression of his<br />\nmusical nature \u2014and in all his<br />\nverses the rhythm and beauty of<br />\nthe song are to be found, rather<br />\nthan didacticism. He was of no<br />\nliterary school; his poetry was the<br />\nnatural expression of his inner self.<br />\nThe flute was the instrument<br />\nwhich Lanier chose as his own, and<br />\nhe was a skillful player. According to Frederick H. Gottlieb, he<br />\nwas one of the greatest virtuosos in<br />\nAmerica. When Karl Wehner,<br />\namong the foremost flute players in<br />\nthe world at that time, visited Baltimore he was taken to Lanier by<br />\nMr. Gottlieb and was so enthused<br />\nby his playing and by the charm of<br />\nthe man himself that he afterward<br />\nsaid that never before had a human<br />\nbeing made such a profound impression upon him.<br />\nIt was this personal charm which<br />\nmade Lanier such a unique figure<br />\namong the poets of his time. Of a<br />\ntrue poetical improvidence, utterly<br />\nabsorbed in his intellectual and musical work, making no plans or provisions other than for the immediate present, he preserved even in<br />\nthe direct financial and physical<br />\nstraits a gentleness, a kindness, a<br />\nkeen appreciation of all that was<br />\nbeautiful. According to those who<br />\nknew him, he was a man whose<br />\nonly fault was an Idealism of too<br />\nlofty a character to equip him for<br />\nworldly battles.<br />\nLike all dreamers, he planned and<br />\nhoped for things which never became realities. Thus his life was<br />\na series of disappointments, but in<br />\nthese he never became bitter, never<br />\ngave over to despair. In regarding<br />\nthe unfulfilled hopes of his life, he<br />\nshowed only a pathetic sorrow, a<br />\nchildlike grief, as when in a letter<br />\nto his wife,, written shortly after<br />\ncoming to Baltimore, he said:<br />\n\"So many great ideas for Art are<br />\nborn to me each day, I am swept<br />\naway into the land of all-delight by<br />\ntheir strenuous, sweet whirlwind;<br />\nand I find within myself such entire,<br />\nyet humble, confidence in possessing every single element of power<br />\nto carry them all out, save the little<br />\npaltry sum of money that would<br />\nsuffice to keep us clothed and fed<br />\nin the meantime. I do not understand this.\"<br />\nIn addition to his financial tribulations was the sorrow which he<br />\nfelt in the fact that his poetic melody was not fully appreciated by his<br />\ncontemporaries. But he was beloved of all who knew him, and<br />\nreverenced by those lovers of music<br />\nwho could feel his worth. Yet,<br />\nuntil his death, the chivalry and<br />\ndignity which he inherited from<br />\nGeorgia did not lessen. Once,<br />\nwhen, during his connection with<br />\nthe Peabody Orchestra, the leader<br />\nduring practice made an insulting<br /><br />\nremark, Lanier, his eyes afire with<br />\nindignation, stepped forward, his<br />\nbent and broken frame already far<br />\nwasted away, and demanded an<br />\napology, and not until the leader<br />\napologized before the assembled<br />\norchestra would he continue to play.<br />\nPOETRY AND MUSIC HIS PASSIONS<br />\n(Continued from page S.)<br /><br />\nA bronze bust of the poet stands<br />\nin the Donovan Room, a tablet to<br />\nhis memory is on its walls, and in<br />\nthe possession of the University are<br />\nmany of his letters and autographed<br />\npoems. Edwin L. Turnbull, an<br />\nalumnus, has written a very interesting composition, \"A Melody<br />\nfrom Lanier's Flute,\" which is a<br />\nmemorial to the poet in music.

Baker, Jr., was elected president unanimously, and<br />\nplans for the season were discussed<br />\nextensively.<br />\nH. Huntley Lloyd and Walter<br />\nGeissel will resume their duties as<br />\nleaders of the two clubs until they<br />\nshall have had time to \"break in\"<br />\nnew men to relieve them.<br />\nLloyd and Ed Spieker have been<br />\nworking out a more efficient system of club management. Heretofore, two men\u2014a graduate and an<br />\nundergraduate student\u2014have taken<br />\nthe entire responsibility of the management of the clubs, with only<br />\nmoderate success. Last year the<br />\nChristmas trip proved a financial<br />\nfailure, and most of the smaller<br />\nchurch concerts given in Baltimore were also failures. The men<br />\nshowed no enthusiasm after the<br />\ntrips had been taken and only a<br />\nsmall percentage of the membership<br />\ntook part in the church concerts.<br />\nIt is thought that the risks can be<br />\nbetter calculated and the schedule<br />\nmore advantageously arranged by<br />\na board of managers. All the other<br />\nstudent activities are in the hands<br />\nof boards and the Musical Clubs<br />\nare going to try a similar system.<br />\nThe board of managers will probably be made up of five members\u2014<br />\nthe president, the two leaders and<br />\nthe two managers\u2014one of whom<br />\nwill also act as treasurer. All important matters will be carefully<br />\nconsidered and voted upon by the<br />\nboard. A committee has been appointed to draw up a definite code<br />\nof rules governing the exact powers and duties of this board, along<br />\nthe lines worked out by the originators of the plan, and its report<br />\nwill be acted upon at the next meeting. The older men consider this<br />\na critical period in the life of the<br />\nclubs, as the management has lost<br />\nmoney during the last two years,<br />\nand there have been rumors of<br />\nabandoning this activity on the<br />\nground that it does not pay. However, the clubs have given no inconsiderable assistance to the Hullabaloo during both years it failed<br />\nto !flake ends meet.<br />\nAfter the report on the new management plan, ex-Manager Fulton<br />\nexplained for the benefit of the<br />\nnew men that the Glee Club consists of quite a large number of<br />\n\u2022members, although the \"team\"<br />\nwhich is sent on the trips must<br />\nnecessarily be a picked number, because of the expense. He urged<br />\nthe men to campaign for candidates!<br />\nAn important change was made<br />\nin the time of holding the Instrumental Club rehearsals. These<br />\nmeetings will probably be held on<br />\nFriday evenings at 7.30 o'clock.<br /><br />\nCarl Jefferson Weber, A.

Instead,<br />\nwe were given a set of rules, easy<br />\nto carry out, which had behind<br />\nthem the force of Hopkins tradition. We expected to be treated as<br />\na source of entertainment, and<br />\nwere treated instead as fellow students.<br />\nSome contributors to your \"Mail<br />\nBag\" have stated that a few violations of the regulations have been<br />\nnpticed ; I am sure that these were<br />\neither because of ignorance or forgetfulness. Other contributors have<br />\nasked for penalties for violations,<br />\nbut it seems to me the very fact<br />\nthat there are no penalties puts us<br />\nfreshmen upon our honor to observe the rules. This, however, is<br />\nunnecessary, for I think the 1918<br />\nclass is willing to do its share towards making the freshmen regulations a Hopkins institution.<br />\n.<br /><br />\nA FRESHMAN.<br />\nThis Week We Have a War-Ballad!<br />\nSchool of Spencer,<br /><br />\n20, 1914.<br /><br />\nTo the Editor of THE NEWS-LEIVER :<br />\nDear Sir\u2014 Having read the clever<br />\nwar stuff that has appeared in recent issues of your estimable pen?dical, I wish to submit the followlug<br />\nballad, which I trust you will<br />\nfind time to try on the editorial<br /><br />\nClothes for Young Men<br />\n$12.50<br /><br />\n$10.00<br /><br />\n$15.00<br /><br />\nHaberdashery of Excellence<br /><br />\nIf it's here, it's alrifrht<br />\nBaltimore &amp; Howard Sts.<br /><br />\nThe Quality Shop<br /><br />\nKRANZ-SMITH PIANO CO.<br /><br />\nand<br /><br />\n100 N.

Baker, Jr., '15, president of the Student Council, has resigned from the Athletic Board. One<br />\nof the requirements for membership<br />\non the Council is that the incumbent<br />\nshall not be a member of the Athletic Board, and since Baker was<br />\nelected to both, he chose to serve<br />\nthe Student Council.<br />\nMyron E. Bagley also was electto the two positions, but will resign<br />\nfrom the Student Council.<br />\nThus, the Athletic Board will<br />\nhave to choose a successor to Baker, and the Junior Class will be required to elect another delegate to<br />\nthe Council.<br /><br />\nfor<br /><br />\n30<br />\n20<br /><br />\nto<br />\n23<br />\n0<br />\n20<br /><br />\n25<br />\n25<br />\n31<br />\n8<br />\n55<br />\n6o<br /><br />\nDuring the next generation, in spite<br />\nof loud prediction to the contrary, these<br />\npercentages will probably increase rather<br />\nthan diminish. The first generation of<br />\nHopkins men is yet in its prime. In<br />\na remarkable way it is copiously and<br />\ncreatively productive. Over all American competitors it has the start of 20<br />\nyears. Whether in the third generation<br />\nthere may be a falling off is a matter<br />\nof conjecture. It depends upon several<br />\nfactors. The growth of the graduate<br />\nschool in the larger universities and in<br />\nthe state universities is an essential element, but not a disturbing one so long<br />\nas college and university are reared side<br />\nby side, and college spirit submerges and<br />\nsmothers university soul.<br />\nThus is one-fourth of all the master<br />\nminds in American science a direct<br />\nproduct of Johns Hopkins influence. So<br />\nis 25 per cent, of all American scientific<br />\nthought impelled by the mainspring of<br />\nBaltimore. It is not quantity of university influx but quality of university output that is telling and worth while.<br /><br />\nDr. Keyes,.the writer of the article, took the degree of doctor of<br />\nphilosophy at this University in<br />\n2.
