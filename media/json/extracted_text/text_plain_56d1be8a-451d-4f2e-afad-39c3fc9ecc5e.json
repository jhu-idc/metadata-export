Y.\u2014Word has<br />\nbeen received by Coach Laurie<br />\nCox, of the Orange lacrosse forces,<br />\nto the effect that the schedule to<br />\nbe played on Syracuse's 1922 invasion of the British Isles is rapidly nearing completion. The Oxford-Cambridge authorities in<br />\ncharge of arrangements have announced that six games have been<br />\nbooked and more are likely to be<br />\nadded.<br />\nSome difficulty is being had in<br />\nbooking games in England due to<br />\nthe time that the Orange squad<br />\nwill make their trip,-which will be<br />\nlate in June, when; most of the<br />\nathletic clubs and schools in<br />\nEngland have dropped lacrosse<br />\nand are devoting their time to<br />\ncricket. Therefore the schedule will be shorter than that<br />\nOf the Oxford-Cambridge team<br />\nwhen they came to this country<br />\nearly last spring. At that time<br />\nthe lacrosse season here was at its<br />\nheight.<br />\nIt was at first hoped that the<br />\nAmerican team could make the<br />\ntrip at Easter time, but this was<br />\nfound to be impossible owing to<br />\nthe interference of studies. This<br />\nplan would also interfere with the<br />\nregular schedule of games to be<br />\nplayed among the colleges in the<br />\nspring, and Syracuse with a veteran aggregation to put on the<br />\nfield has hopes of again claiming<br />\nthe championship. A trip to England at Easter time would necessitate the withdrawal of the Orange<br />\nteam from the northern division<br />\nof the Intercollegiate League.<br />\nWith the foreign trip in view,<br />\nthe spring schedule this year will<br />\nprobably be kept down to about<br />\neight or nine games. Manager<br />\nFolsom is already at work arranging suitable dates with the various managements. Four league<br />\ngames will be played as usual with<br />\nCornell, Hobart, Yale and Harvard. The latter two teams will<br />\nbe met on the Syracuse field this<br />\nseason. The remaining games of<br />\nthe schedule will no doubt include<br />\ngames with the Navy, Penn State,<br />\nCrescent A. C. and the local lacrosse club.<br />\nCoach Cox is holding a sixweeks' practice session this fall<br />\nto keep his men in condition and<br />\nalso to look over the possible material eligible from last year's<br />\nFreshman squad.

Y.\u2014Word has<br />\nbeen received by Coach Laurie<br />\nCox, of the Orange lacrosse forces,<br />\nto the effect that the schedule to<br />\nbe played on Syracuse's 1922 invasion of the British Isles is rapidly nearing completion. The Oxford-Cambridge authorities in<br />\ncharge of arrangements have announced that six games have been<br />\nbooked and more are likely to be<br />\nadded.<br />\nSome difficulty is being had in<br />\nbooking games in England due to<br />\nthe time that the Orange squad<br />\nwill make their trip,-which will be<br />\nlate in June, when; most of the<br />\nathletic clubs and schools in<br />\nEngland have dropped lacrosse<br />\nand are devoting their time to<br />\ncricket. Therefore the schedule will be shorter than that<br />\nOf the Oxford-Cambridge team<br />\nwhen they came to this country<br />\nearly last spring. At that time<br />\nthe lacrosse season here was at its<br />\nheight.<br />\nIt was at first hoped that the<br />\nAmerican team could make the<br />\ntrip at Easter time, but this was<br />\nfound to be impossible owing to<br />\nthe interference of studies. This<br />\nplan would also interfere with the<br />\nregular schedule of games to be<br />\nplayed among the colleges in the<br />\nspring, and Syracuse with a veteran aggregation to put on the<br />\nfield has hopes of again claiming<br />\nthe championship. A trip to England at Easter time would necessitate the withdrawal of the Orange<br />\nteam from the northern division<br />\nof the Intercollegiate League.<br />\nWith the foreign trip in view,<br />\nthe spring schedule this year will<br />\nprobably be kept down to about<br />\neight or nine games. Manager<br />\nFolsom is already at work arranging suitable dates with the various managements. Four league<br />\ngames will be played as usual with<br />\nCornell, Hobart, Yale and Harvard. The latter two teams will<br />\nbe met on the Syracuse field this<br />\nseason. The remaining games of<br />\nthe schedule will no doubt include<br />\ngames with the Navy, Penn State,<br />\nCrescent A. C. and the local lacrosse club.<br />\nCoach Cox is holding a sixweeks' practice session this fall<br />\nto keep his men in condition and<br />\nalso to look over the possible material eligible from last year's<br />\nFreshman squad.
