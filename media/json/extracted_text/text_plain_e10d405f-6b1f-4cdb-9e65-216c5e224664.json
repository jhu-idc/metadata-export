But\u2014<br />\nIs college worth the price?<br />\nEvery now and then the powers tell us that a tuition fee amounts<br />\nto no more than a small fraction of the actual expense of turning<br />\nout a Bachelor of Arts. True, we might say to them, but a tuition<br />\nfee for most students is a large sum, no matter what portion of<br />\nthe total expense it pays and, furthermore, the tuition is not the<br />\nwhole price we must pay, nor is it the most important part of the<br />\nwhole price. After all, we must have a place to sleep, clothes to<br />\nwear, food to eat, and an occasional modern book, even when we<br />\nare undergraduates. And our most costly offering to the Alma<br />\nMater has yet to be mentioned: the precious years of youth we<br />\ngive her. Is it then untimely to consider again that old question?<br />\nIt seems to me that graduation without a strong conviction in an<br />\naffirmative answer would be quite a hollow success.<br />\nUnfortunately, my answer is conditional. If one has passed<br />\nfrom childhood and adolescence well into a genuine adult attitude<br />\ntoward life, college has been worth whatever price he has paid.<br />\nH. G. Wells, in The World of William Clissold, gives me the<br />\nspecial connotations for my terms \"childhood,\" \"adolescence\" and<br />\n\"adult.\" He says: \"We grow out of belief. All children are<br />\nnaturally believers. They begin with a sense of being completely<br />\nprotected. . . . But we who really go right through into the completely adult stage come out beyond any sense of providence and<br />\nresponsibility. We know we are exposed and unprotected.\" I<br />\nknow the thousand other answers to my question. I have heard<br />\nmen point out the value of college friendships, the value of rubbing<br />\nshoulders with larger minds, the value of what practical information we accumulate, the value of the culture which inevitably comes<br />\nto the better university men but all these, I say, are of minor<br />\nimportance when mental attitude is considered.<br />\nIf the young A. B. still believes in protection, in providence<br />\nand responsibility, he has tossed away his purse for nothing. He<br />\nis a child. But if he knows he is alone\u2014exposed and unprotected,<br />\nwith no providence caring for him\u2014then he has spent wisely.<br />\nAnd if this realization thrills him, rather like the smell of acrid<br />\nsmoke does the old soldier, then he has a chance. . . .<br />\n<br />\nSUPER-SONIC WAVES ASTONISH THOSE<br />\nWHO OBSERVE ASTOUNDING RESULTS<br />\n<br />\nThe TRIAL OF<br />\nDONALD WESTHOF<br />\nDirected by Dr. Wendhausen with<br />\nIMRE RADY and KARIN EVANS<br />\n<br />\nBrings to the screen a great study<br />\nof modern youth.<br />\nDIRECT FROM ITS RECENT<br />\nBROADWAY SUCCESS<br />\nOne of the most important films\u2014<br />\ngripping story.

Shaw of that institution. The managing editor of a<br />\nstudent paper, published on the campus but unrecognized by the college<br />\nofficials, was recently summarily suspended from college by the Dean as<br />\nthe result of an editorial to which<br />\n,he confessed authorship. In his<br />\nattempted masterpiece for some reason or other, the now former editoi<br />\nstated that \"the college is not a college at all, but a political playground<br />\nwhere the college presidency is a bait<br />\nfor party electioneers and a State<br />\ninstitution for governors to practice<br />\neconomy or to cover up grafts elsewhere in the machine.\" He queried<br />\nfurther in his sweeping statement,<br />\n\"What can one expect from such a<br />\ncondition where corruption and graft<br />\nreign?\" Affirming later his evident<br />\nbelief in his own superiority, the<br />\nmisguided youth declared that \"one<br />\ncould not expect to find many students of an intellectual nature, since<br />\nthey had all been scared away by<br />\nthe political bugaboo and the unintellectual atmosphere.\"<br />\n* * *<br />\nRather unforeseen events have<br />\noccurred to a student at the University of Minnesota as the result of<br />\nhis writing a story on Arabia and<br />\nthe Foreign Legion. Because of the<br />\nexceedingly realistic quality of this<br />\nwork, the report became widespread<br />\nthat the youth was a deserter of the<br />\nForeign Legion and was wanted by<br />\nthat outfit. There was some little<br />\nconfusion before the matter was<br />\nfinally clarified and the student's repeated assertions of his innocence<br />\nwere accepted.<br />\n*<br />\n<br />\n*<br />\n<br />\n*<br />\n<br />\nDisplacing the present curriculum<br />\nof twenty years' standing, a revised<br />\nprogram of undergraduate instruction, intended to open new and more<br />\nextensive fields to the student, will<br />\nbe effected at Columbia next September. It is intended that the<br />\nfreshman and sophomore years will<br />\nbe devoted to \"orientation and discovery,\" while the last two will be<br />\ngiven to study in preparation for<br />\ngraduate or professional work. On<br />\nthe subject of this plan and its aims<br />\nPresident Nicholas Murray Butler<br />\nrecently stated: \"Every effort has<br />\nbeen made to measure progress toward the bachelor's degree in terms<br />\nof real achievement rather than in<br />\nthat of prescribed courses, hours,<br />\npoints or anything of that nature.<br />\nA student who can show that he is<br />\ncompetent of omitting any of the<br />\ncourses ordinarily prescribed for<br />\nthe undergraduate will be encouraged to do so.\" All of which sounds<br />\nworthy of a trial or at least of investigation.<br />\n* * *<br />\n<br />\nThe subject of Levering Hall is<br />\none on which every one who is no<br />\none feels compelled, at one time or<br />\nanother, to air his opinions in ink,<br />\nif I have not mixed metaphors. I<br />\nthink I have read nearly all that has<br />\nbeen written on the matter, and I<br />\nfind a surprising unanimity in one<br />\nrespect: We are afraid of the Y. M.<br />\nC. A.<br />\nApparently the Y. M. C. A. is to<br />\ndominate the University and all<br />\nthings will be under the Y's control.<br />\nPictures, droll pictures, amusing pictures, ridiculous pictures, have been<br />\npainted of the placarded interior of<br />\na militant religious center. Imaginations have had the grandest frolic<br />\nin years, coursing up and down<br />\nthrough the Levering Hall-to-be.<br />\nAnd through it all we are afraid of<br />\nthe Y. M. C. A.<br />\nSmall wonder that we fear, I suppose. See how the Y is situated<br />\nnow: Solidly intrenched in the<br />\nBarn, the \"Heart of the Campus,\"<br />\nin the very center of all activities,<br />\nit saps the strength of all and extends its grasping fingers even into<br />\nthe Athletic Office, so that the<br />\ncoaches tremble when the Y is mentioned. Like a canker it grows,<br />\nadding new members every week,<br />\nyes, every day\u2014so that there are<br />\nalmost a dozen men in the organization who are willing to work<br />\nheart and soul for its cause.<br />\nPause and reflect how all this<br />\nwould be furthered by -Levering<br />\nHall. The walls would be papered<br />\nwith posters, we understand, and<br />\nany person who rides through our<br />\ncountryside papered with Chesterfield ads, and still clings to his<br />\nLuckys should realize the power of<br />\nsuch \"propaganda.\" And \"Doc\"<br />\nAdams, in taking over the new cafeteria, would immediately find himself under the Y's control and would<br />\nbe prohibited from selling any sort<br />\nof deviled egg sandwich. Perhaps<br />\neven short chocolates and short<br />\nchange would be put in the same<br />\nclass. And the NEWS-LETTER, 110W<br />\ndominated by the Y. M.C. A., would<br />\nfind itself, as soon as it moved into<br />\nthe new activities building, completely taken over by the \"Y.\" And as<br />\na last thought\u2014think what would<br />\nhappen to the Blue Jay!<br />\nThus can the imagination play<br />\nbut this much can be said with complete surety: instead of twelve active<br />\nworkers in the \"Y,\" a much larger<br />\nnumber, say thirteen at least, would<br />\ncarry on the despotic purposes of<br />\nthe organization.

During<br />\nthe period of investigation, the government engineers worked with<br />\nthose of the State and finally completed measurements of stresses<br />\nthat were undergone by the bridge<br />\ndue to heavy loads which they imposed upon it.<br />\nAfter the completion of these<br />\nvarious measurements, the bridge<br />\nv1/4ras bombed by planes of the Army<br />\nAir Service, then subjected to the<br />\nheavy fire of artillery.

But\u2014<br />\nIs college worth the price?<br />\nEvery now and then the powers tell us that a tuition fee amounts<br />\nto no more than a small fraction of the actual expense of turning<br />\nout a Bachelor of Arts. True, we might say to them, but a tuition<br />\nfee for most students is a large sum, no matter what portion of<br />\nthe total expense it pays and, furthermore, the tuition is not the<br />\nwhole price we must pay, nor is it the most important part of the<br />\nwhole price. After all, we must have a place to sleep, clothes to<br />\nwear, food to eat, and an occasional modern book, even when we<br />\nare undergraduates. And our most costly offering to the Alma<br />\nMater has yet to be mentioned: the precious years of youth we<br />\ngive her. Is it then untimely to consider again that old question?<br />\nIt seems to me that graduation without a strong conviction in an<br />\naffirmative answer would be quite a hollow success.<br />\nUnfortunately, my answer is conditional. If one has passed<br />\nfrom childhood and adolescence well into a genuine adult attitude<br />\ntoward life, college has been worth whatever price he has paid.<br />\nH. G. Wells, in The World of William Clissold, gives me the<br />\nspecial connotations for my terms \"childhood,\" \"adolescence\" and<br />\n\"adult.\" He says: \"We grow out of belief. All children are<br />\nnaturally believers. They begin with a sense of being completely<br />\nprotected. . . . But we who really go right through into the completely adult stage come out beyond any sense of providence and<br />\nresponsibility. We know we are exposed and unprotected.\" I<br />\nknow the thousand other answers to my question. I have heard<br />\nmen point out the value of college friendships, the value of rubbing<br />\nshoulders with larger minds, the value of what practical information we accumulate, the value of the culture which inevitably comes<br />\nto the better university men but all these, I say, are of minor<br />\nimportance when mental attitude is considered.<br />\nIf the young A. B. still believes in protection, in providence<br />\nand responsibility, he has tossed away his purse for nothing. He<br />\nis a child. But if he knows he is alone\u2014exposed and unprotected,<br />\nwith no providence caring for him\u2014then he has spent wisely.<br />\nAnd if this realization thrills him, rather like the smell of acrid<br />\nsmoke does the old soldier, then he has a chance. . . .<br /><br />\nSUPER-SONIC WAVES ASTONISH THOSE<br />\nWHO OBSERVE ASTOUNDING RESULTS<br /><br />\nThe TRIAL OF<br />\nDONALD WESTHOF<br />\nDirected by Dr. Wendhausen with<br />\nIMRE RADY and KARIN EVANS<br /><br />\nBrings to the screen a great study<br />\nof modern youth.<br />\nDIRECT FROM ITS RECENT<br />\nBROADWAY SUCCESS<br />\nOne of the most important films\u2014<br />\ngripping story.

Shaw of that institution. The managing editor of a<br />\nstudent paper, published on the campus but unrecognized by the college<br />\nofficials, was recently summarily suspended from college by the Dean as<br />\nthe result of an editorial to which<br />\n,he confessed authorship. In his<br />\nattempted masterpiece for some reason or other, the now former editoi<br />\nstated that \"the college is not a college at all, but a political playground<br />\nwhere the college presidency is a bait<br />\nfor party electioneers and a State<br />\ninstitution for governors to practice<br />\neconomy or to cover up grafts elsewhere in the machine.\" He queried<br />\nfurther in his sweeping statement,<br />\n\"What can one expect from such a<br />\ncondition where corruption and graft<br />\nreign?\" Affirming later his evident<br />\nbelief in his own superiority, the<br />\nmisguided youth declared that \"one<br />\ncould not expect to find many students of an intellectual nature, since<br />\nthey had all been scared away by<br />\nthe political bugaboo and the unintellectual atmosphere.\"<br />\n* * *<br />\nRather unforeseen events have<br />\noccurred to a student at the University of Minnesota as the result of<br />\nhis writing a story on Arabia and<br />\nthe Foreign Legion. Because of the<br />\nexceedingly realistic quality of this<br />\nwork, the report became widespread<br />\nthat the youth was a deserter of the<br />\nForeign Legion and was wanted by<br />\nthat outfit. There was some little<br />\nconfusion before the matter was<br />\nfinally clarified and the student's repeated assertions of his innocence<br />\nwere accepted.<br />\n*<br /><br />\n*<br /><br />\n*<br /><br />\nDisplacing the present curriculum<br />\nof twenty years' standing, a revised<br />\nprogram of undergraduate instruction, intended to open new and more<br />\nextensive fields to the student, will<br />\nbe effected at Columbia next September. It is intended that the<br />\nfreshman and sophomore years will<br />\nbe devoted to \"orientation and discovery,\" while the last two will be<br />\ngiven to study in preparation for<br />\ngraduate or professional work. On<br />\nthe subject of this plan and its aims<br />\nPresident Nicholas Murray Butler<br />\nrecently stated: \"Every effort has<br />\nbeen made to measure progress toward the bachelor's degree in terms<br />\nof real achievement rather than in<br />\nthat of prescribed courses, hours,<br />\npoints or anything of that nature.<br />\nA student who can show that he is<br />\ncompetent of omitting any of the<br />\ncourses ordinarily prescribed for<br />\nthe undergraduate will be encouraged to do so.\" All of which sounds<br />\nworthy of a trial or at least of investigation.<br />\n* * *<br /><br />\nThe subject of Levering Hall is<br />\none on which every one who is no<br />\none feels compelled, at one time or<br />\nanother, to air his opinions in ink,<br />\nif I have not mixed metaphors. I<br />\nthink I have read nearly all that has<br />\nbeen written on the matter, and I<br />\nfind a surprising unanimity in one<br />\nrespect: We are afraid of the Y. M.<br />\nC. A.<br />\nApparently the Y. M. C. A. is to<br />\ndominate the University and all<br />\nthings will be under the Y's control.<br />\nPictures, droll pictures, amusing pictures, ridiculous pictures, have been<br />\npainted of the placarded interior of<br />\na militant religious center. Imaginations have had the grandest frolic<br />\nin years, coursing up and down<br />\nthrough the Levering Hall-to-be.<br />\nAnd through it all we are afraid of<br />\nthe Y. M. C. A.<br />\nSmall wonder that we fear, I suppose. See how the Y is situated<br />\nnow: Solidly intrenched in the<br />\nBarn, the \"Heart of the Campus,\"<br />\nin the very center of all activities,<br />\nit saps the strength of all and extends its grasping fingers even into<br />\nthe Athletic Office, so that the<br />\ncoaches tremble when the Y is mentioned. Like a canker it grows,<br />\nadding new members every week,<br />\nyes, every day\u2014so that there are<br />\nalmost a dozen men in the organization who are willing to work<br />\nheart and soul for its cause.<br />\nPause and reflect how all this<br />\nwould be furthered by -Levering<br />\nHall. The walls would be papered<br />\nwith posters, we understand, and<br />\nany person who rides through our<br />\ncountryside papered with Chesterfield ads, and still clings to his<br />\nLuckys should realize the power of<br />\nsuch \"propaganda.\" And \"Doc\"<br />\nAdams, in taking over the new cafeteria, would immediately find himself under the Y's control and would<br />\nbe prohibited from selling any sort<br />\nof deviled egg sandwich. Perhaps<br />\neven short chocolates and short<br />\nchange would be put in the same<br />\nclass. And the NEWS-LETTER, 110W<br />\ndominated by the Y. M.C. A., would<br />\nfind itself, as soon as it moved into<br />\nthe new activities building, completely taken over by the \"Y.\" And as<br />\na last thought\u2014think what would<br />\nhappen to the Blue Jay!<br />\nThus can the imagination play<br />\nbut this much can be said with complete surety: instead of twelve active<br />\nworkers in the \"Y,\" a much larger<br />\nnumber, say thirteen at least, would<br />\ncarry on the despotic purposes of<br />\nthe organization.
