The Glee Club has been<br />\nrather seriously hampered in its<br />\nwork by a decided lack of candidates for the tenor section. If men<br />\ncome out for the positions in question within the next few days, the<br />\nwork on the regular program will<br />\nbe completed in two or three rehearsals and the club will begin to<br />\ndevote some of its time to working<br />\nup several numbers somewhat out<br />\nof the ordinary run of music used<br />\nby Hopkins singers.

Men are still needed for<br />\nall positions on the club and a call<br />\nhas been issued by the director for<br />\ninstrumentalists of any kind. Rehearsals are held regularly on Friday nights, and from now on extra<br />\nwork will be done at odd times during the week.<br />\nSeveral special acts are being<br />\ntried, and, if successful, will be featured on the program. The music,<br />\nboth vocal and instrumental, is all<br />\nnew and includes a number of<br />\nnovelties which are expected to<br />\nmake a hit with Baltimore audiences. The clubs only need a few<br />\nmore men to complete their equipment for a big success.<br />\nThe McCoy Hall concert and<br />\ndance, which is scheduled for the<br />\nevening of February 25, will be<br />\nmade especially attractive in order<br />\nto enlist the support of more alumni<br />\nand friends of the University. Since<br />\nthe attendance of undergraduate<br />\nstudents not members of the clubs<br />\nhas been nominal in past years, an<br />\neffort to make the concert much<br />\nmore of a student affair will be<br />\nmade. Tickets will be sold to undergraduates at reduced rates, according to a plan, details of which<br />\nwill be given out at the time tickets<br />\nare put on sale.<br />\nThe success of the clubs now depends on the support given them by<br />\nHopkins men.

Welch, dean of<br />\nthe Johns Hopkins Medical School,<br />\nhas just returned to Baltimore after a trip to China, which he undertook last summer as a representative of the Rockefeller Foundation.<br />\nDr. Welch left on June 30. He<br />\nspent three weeks in the Hawaiian<br />\nIslands and five weeks in Yokohama, Japan; visited Pekin and<br />\nMoukton and went up the Yangtse<br />\nRiver beyond Hamktow.<br />\nThe chief purpose of Dr. Welch's<br />\nexpedition was to investigate medical education in China, and to introduce some of the medical ideas<br />\nof the Occidentals. As a result of<br />\nthe visit, Dr. Welch will make extensive recommendations tending to<br />\nimprove the medical ideas of the<br />\ncountry through the China Medical Board, of which he is a member.<br />\nThe report to this board has not<br />\nas yet been made. Dr. Welch said<br />\nthat the work to be taken in hand<br />\nimmediately would be the enlarging<br />\nof the Union Medical School in<br />\nPekin and the possible establishment<br />\nof another school, probably in<br />\nShanghai.<br />\nDr. Welch, when interviewed,<br />\nstated that the opportunities for<br />\nmedical education in China are very<br />\ngreat, but that there are serious<br />\ndrawbacks, such as the difficulties<br />\nmet in locating the schools, lack of<br />\nfunds wherewith to pay for the services of good doctors, and inability<br />\nto acquire good men without paying<br />\ngood salaries.<br />\n\u2022<br />\nDr. Welch also expressed himself<br />\nin regard to the political situation<br />\nin China. He is of the opinion that<br />\nChina is not so much of a republic<br />\nas a military despotism, and thinks<br />\nthat the sentiment of the country<br />\nis apparently opposed to the republican form.<br />\nAs regards the relations of the<br />\nUnited States with Japan, Dr.<br />\nWelch believes that there is nothing<br />\nwhich need at any time in the future cause a clash between the two<br />\ncountries. At the same time, however, he stated that the Japanese are<br />\na proud people, who are deter \u2022<br />\nmined that they shall be accepted<br />\non the same basis on which the<br />\nother great nations of the world are<br />\naccepted.<br />\nNow that Japan has been cut off<br />\nfrom its medical relations with Germany, Dr. Welch thinks many are<br />\ncoming to this country to study<br />\nmedicine. Moreover, the Japanese<br />\nhave developed the study of medicine within their own land to such<br />\na point that we are able to learn<br />\nfrom them.<br />\nThis has been the first time since<br />\nhis connection with Hopkins that<br />\nDr. Welch has not been at the University for the opening of the academic year.<br />\n<br />\nWith the holiday season a thing<br />\nof the past, the lacrosse squad has<br />\nnow settled down to the hard work<br />\nthat is ahead in order to develop<br />\na championship 1916 team.<br />\nSeveral practices were held in<br />\nthe cage during the Christmas holidays. However, it is realized that<br />\nwith only about two months left to<br />\nround out the team there is much<br />\nhard work ahead for the members<br />\nof the squad. Captain Paul Sutton especially emphasizes the need<br />\nof defensive material. The team<br />\nwill be materially weakened in this<br />\ndepartment this season through the<br />\nloss of John Huck. With this in<br />\nmind, the coaches are watching a<br />\nnumber of new men who are showing particularly good form for this<br />\nposition.<br />\nPractices are now held daily.<br />\nCoach Rainey Wolfe heretofore has<br />\nbeen rather lax with the men in<br />\nregard to attendance, but now he<br />\nwants it known that it is imperative that all men who are out for<br />\nthe team must report more regularly, especially on Wednesday and<br />\nSaturday, when the entire squad<br />\nworks out in the cage.<br />\nScrimmages are also a feature of<br />\nthe practices. The squad is divided<br />\ninto two teams, with the lineup<br />\nchanged from time to time, in order<br />\nto give the men a better chance to<br />\ntry out the various positions.<br />\nA contemplation of this season's<br />\nmaterial shows prospects for a lacrosse team that will compare with<br />\nlast year's championship team to<br />\nbe very bright. The squad is composed of about forty men and contains ten of the twelve members ofthe 1915 team. The two players<br />\nwho were lost are John Huck and<br />\nToni Troxell, two of the best lacrosse players who ever represented<br />\nthe Black and Blue. The coaches<br />\nrealize that they have a hard task<br />\nbefore them in filling the places of<br />\nthese former stars, but are relying<br />\non last year's substitutes and a number of new players on the squad<br />\nwho entered the University this<br />\nyear from City College and Polytechnic Institute to fill the open<br />\ngaps.<br />\nProbably the most promising new<br />\nmember of the squad is Arthur<br />\nKnipp, an uncle of Johnny Knipp,<br />\nwho has returned to the University this year in order to take certain engineering courses. Some<br />\nyears ago, Mr. Knipp was a star<br />\nmember of Hopkins teams, playing<br />\non the 'Varsity for three successive<br />\nyears. He is still eligible by the<br />\nrules of the Intercollegiate Lacrosse<br />\nLeague to play another year for the<br />\nBlack and Blue.<br />\nThe coaches also emphasize the<br />\nfact that although only two vacancies appear this year, there are at<br />\nall times twelve positions to be contested for, and the tiew men have<br />\n<br />\nJUNIORS AND SENIORS HARD<br />\nAT WORK ON COMING DEBATE<br />\n<br />\nPreparations for the inter-class<br />\ndebate are being made by both the<br />\nJunior and Senior teams, and there<br />\nis every indication that the contest<br />\nof January 28 will be a hard-fought<br />\nand interesting one.<br />\nOwing to the fact that preparations for the 'Varsity triangle debates have not as yet been completed, the class debaters did no<br />\nwork whatever previous to or during the Christmas holidays. The<br />\nmen on both teams were anxious<br />\nto have the same subject for the<br />\ninter-class as for the University<br />\ndebates in order that a great<br />\ndeal of extra work might be saved<br />\nand the contests of next spring adequately prepared for. As further<br />\ndelay is now impossible, however,<br />\nthe work of preparation has been<br />\nactivly entered upon, and Hopkins<br />\nis hoping that the question submitted by her council will meet<br />\nwith the approval of Virginia and<br />\nNorth Carolina.<br />\nThe subject of the Junior-Senior<br />\ndebate, \"Resolved, that for state legislatures a unicameral is preferable<br />\nto a bicameral system,\" is one that<br />\nhas of late been discussed by many<br />\nwriters on political subjects, and<br />\nthat should prove of particular interest to the members of the first<br />\nundergraduate class in political science in the University.<br />\nPositions on the two teams were<br />\nnot as closely contested this year as<br />\nis usually the case, owing to the fact<br />\nthat the tryouts were held immediately before the Christmas examinations. The members of the Junior team, which will champion the<br />\naffirmative of the question, are A. A.<br />\nSteinbach, chairman; A. A. Weech<br />\nand Randolph Smith, while the Senior debaters are T. J. Tingley, chairman; G. Franklin Ludington and<br />\nHarrison C. Coffin. Mr. C.

A walled<br />\ncity in the midst of the activities of<br />\nthe city proper, the forum was a<br />\nplace set apart suitable for special<br />\nfunctions, where the orators spoke,<br />\nfrom which the emperors sent forth<br />\nthe generals and governors of the<br />\nempire, and where many religious<br />\ncelebrations were held.<br />\n\"Cxsar also first attempted the<br />\nbeautification of the Campus Martins and devoted himself to the construction of such massive public<br />\nstructures as the Circus Maximus<br />\nand the Basilica Julia. The system<br />\nof parks and public places thus inaugurated was advanced by the succeeding emperors, notably Augustus, Vespasian, Nerva and Trajan.\"<br />\nProfessor Fairclough closed his<br />\nlecture by calling attention to the<br />\nlarge part classical architecture has<br />\nplayed in America's model city of<br />\nthe Panama-Pacific Exposition.

As a matter of fact,<br />\nevery man at Hopkins ought to take<br />\na personal interest in the Senior annual. It is not the record of the<br />\naccomplishments of the graduating<br />\nclass alone: it is typical of the University as a whole. There is no<br />\nHopkins activity, from football to<br />\nchess, that is not given its adequate<br />\nplace and reCorded all due honor between its covers. The Hullabaloo is<br />\ntypical of Hopkins life and of Hopkins men.<br />\nThe Board this year has done<br />\neverything in its power to make the<br />\nbook the best that has ever been<br />\nissued by a Hopkins graduating<br />\nclass. They have secured the services of the ablest engravers in the<br />\n<br />\ncountry, and the photographic work<br />\nis of the highest quality. Advance<br />\nindications are to the effect that the<br />\n1916 book will be the \"best ever.\"<br />\nBut the Board can only create a<br />\ngood Hullabaloo; they can not make<br />\nit a success. That is the manifest<br />\nduty of every man at the University.<br />\nThere is no reason why the Hopkins annual should not occupy a<br />\nposition among \u2022 the best college<br />\nyearbooks published in the country.<br />\nIt should be a matter of pride with<br />\nHopkins men to make it occupy<br />\nsuch a position.<br />\nThe 1916 benefit will be held Friday night, January 21, at Ford's.<br />\nDon't give up too early in your attempt to sell the Senior tickets. And<br />\nby all means be on hand Friday<br />\nnight to make it a real Hopkins<br />\nnight, and not a hopeless \"flareback.\"<br />\nSENIORS ELECT DR.

The Glee Club has been<br />\nrather seriously hampered in its<br />\nwork by a decided lack of candidates for the tenor section. If men<br />\ncome out for the positions in question within the next few days, the<br />\nwork on the regular program will<br />\nbe completed in two or three rehearsals and the club will begin to<br />\ndevote some of its time to working<br />\nup several numbers somewhat out<br />\nof the ordinary run of music used<br />\nby Hopkins singers.

Men are still needed for<br />\nall positions on the club and a call<br />\nhas been issued by the director for<br />\ninstrumentalists of any kind. Rehearsals are held regularly on Friday nights, and from now on extra<br />\nwork will be done at odd times during the week.<br />\nSeveral special acts are being<br />\ntried, and, if successful, will be featured on the program. The music,<br />\nboth vocal and instrumental, is all<br />\nnew and includes a number of<br />\nnovelties which are expected to<br />\nmake a hit with Baltimore audiences. The clubs only need a few<br />\nmore men to complete their equipment for a big success.<br />\nThe McCoy Hall concert and<br />\ndance, which is scheduled for the<br />\nevening of February 25, will be<br />\nmade especially attractive in order<br />\nto enlist the support of more alumni<br />\nand friends of the University. Since<br />\nthe attendance of undergraduate<br />\nstudents not members of the clubs<br />\nhas been nominal in past years, an<br />\neffort to make the concert much<br />\nmore of a student affair will be<br />\nmade. Tickets will be sold to undergraduates at reduced rates, according to a plan, details of which<br />\nwill be given out at the time tickets<br />\nare put on sale.<br />\nThe success of the clubs now depends on the support given them by<br />\nHopkins men.

Welch, dean of<br />\nthe Johns Hopkins Medical School,<br />\nhas just returned to Baltimore after a trip to China, which he undertook last summer as a representative of the Rockefeller Foundation.<br />\nDr. Welch left on June 30. He<br />\nspent three weeks in the Hawaiian<br />\nIslands and five weeks in Yokohama, Japan; visited Pekin and<br />\nMoukton and went up the Yangtse<br />\nRiver beyond Hamktow.<br />\nThe chief purpose of Dr. Welch's<br />\nexpedition was to investigate medical education in China, and to introduce some of the medical ideas<br />\nof the Occidentals. As a result of<br />\nthe visit, Dr. Welch will make extensive recommendations tending to<br />\nimprove the medical ideas of the<br />\ncountry through the China Medical Board, of which he is a member.<br />\nThe report to this board has not<br />\nas yet been made. Dr. Welch said<br />\nthat the work to be taken in hand<br />\nimmediately would be the enlarging<br />\nof the Union Medical School in<br />\nPekin and the possible establishment<br />\nof another school, probably in<br />\nShanghai.<br />\nDr. Welch, when interviewed,<br />\nstated that the opportunities for<br />\nmedical education in China are very<br />\ngreat, but that there are serious<br />\ndrawbacks, such as the difficulties<br />\nmet in locating the schools, lack of<br />\nfunds wherewith to pay for the services of good doctors, and inability<br />\nto acquire good men without paying<br />\ngood salaries.<br />\n\u2022<br />\nDr. Welch also expressed himself<br />\nin regard to the political situation<br />\nin China. He is of the opinion that<br />\nChina is not so much of a republic<br />\nas a military despotism, and thinks<br />\nthat the sentiment of the country<br />\nis apparently opposed to the republican form.<br />\nAs regards the relations of the<br />\nUnited States with Japan, Dr.<br />\nWelch believes that there is nothing<br />\nwhich need at any time in the future cause a clash between the two<br />\ncountries. At the same time, however, he stated that the Japanese are<br />\na proud people, who are deter \u2022<br />\nmined that they shall be accepted<br />\non the same basis on which the<br />\nother great nations of the world are<br />\naccepted.<br />\nNow that Japan has been cut off<br />\nfrom its medical relations with Germany, Dr. Welch thinks many are<br />\ncoming to this country to study<br />\nmedicine. Moreover, the Japanese<br />\nhave developed the study of medicine within their own land to such<br />\na point that we are able to learn<br />\nfrom them.<br />\nThis has been the first time since<br />\nhis connection with Hopkins that<br />\nDr. Welch has not been at the University for the opening of the academic year.<br /><br />\nWith the holiday season a thing<br />\nof the past, the lacrosse squad has<br />\nnow settled down to the hard work<br />\nthat is ahead in order to develop<br />\na championship 1916 team.<br />\nSeveral practices were held in<br />\nthe cage during the Christmas holidays. However, it is realized that<br />\nwith only about two months left to<br />\nround out the team there is much<br />\nhard work ahead for the members<br />\nof the squad. Captain Paul Sutton especially emphasizes the need<br />\nof defensive material. The team<br />\nwill be materially weakened in this<br />\ndepartment this season through the<br />\nloss of John Huck. With this in<br />\nmind, the coaches are watching a<br />\nnumber of new men who are showing particularly good form for this<br />\nposition.<br />\nPractices are now held daily.<br />\nCoach Rainey Wolfe heretofore has<br />\nbeen rather lax with the men in<br />\nregard to attendance, but now he<br />\nwants it known that it is imperative that all men who are out for<br />\nthe team must report more regularly, especially on Wednesday and<br />\nSaturday, when the entire squad<br />\nworks out in the cage.<br />\nScrimmages are also a feature of<br />\nthe practices. The squad is divided<br />\ninto two teams, with the lineup<br />\nchanged from time to time, in order<br />\nto give the men a better chance to<br />\ntry out the various positions.<br />\nA contemplation of this season's<br />\nmaterial shows prospects for a lacrosse team that will compare with<br />\nlast year's championship team to<br />\nbe very bright. The squad is composed of about forty men and contains ten of the twelve members ofthe 1915 team. The two players<br />\nwho were lost are John Huck and<br />\nToni Troxell, two of the best lacrosse players who ever represented<br />\nthe Black and Blue. The coaches<br />\nrealize that they have a hard task<br />\nbefore them in filling the places of<br />\nthese former stars, but are relying<br />\non last year's substitutes and a number of new players on the squad<br />\nwho entered the University this<br />\nyear from City College and Polytechnic Institute to fill the open<br />\ngaps.<br />\nProbably the most promising new<br />\nmember of the squad is Arthur<br />\nKnipp, an uncle of Johnny Knipp,<br />\nwho has returned to the University this year in order to take certain engineering courses. Some<br />\nyears ago, Mr. Knipp was a star<br />\nmember of Hopkins teams, playing<br />\non the 'Varsity for three successive<br />\nyears. He is still eligible by the<br />\nrules of the Intercollegiate Lacrosse<br />\nLeague to play another year for the<br />\nBlack and Blue.<br />\nThe coaches also emphasize the<br />\nfact that although only two vacancies appear this year, there are at<br />\nall times twelve positions to be contested for, and the tiew men have<br /><br />\nJUNIORS AND SENIORS HARD<br />\nAT WORK ON COMING DEBATE<br /><br />\nPreparations for the inter-class<br />\ndebate are being made by both the<br />\nJunior and Senior teams, and there<br />\nis every indication that the contest<br />\nof January 28 will be a hard-fought<br />\nand interesting one.<br />\nOwing to the fact that preparations for the 'Varsity triangle debates have not as yet been completed, the class debaters did no<br />\nwork whatever previous to or during the Christmas holidays. The<br />\nmen on both teams were anxious<br />\nto have the same subject for the<br />\ninter-class as for the University<br />\ndebates in order that a great<br />\ndeal of extra work might be saved<br />\nand the contests of next spring adequately prepared for. As further<br />\ndelay is now impossible, however,<br />\nthe work of preparation has been<br />\nactivly entered upon, and Hopkins<br />\nis hoping that the question submitted by her council will meet<br />\nwith the approval of Virginia and<br />\nNorth Carolina.<br />\nThe subject of the Junior-Senior<br />\ndebate, \"Resolved, that for state legislatures a unicameral is preferable<br />\nto a bicameral system,\" is one that<br />\nhas of late been discussed by many<br />\nwriters on political subjects, and<br />\nthat should prove of particular interest to the members of the first<br />\nundergraduate class in political science in the University.<br />\nPositions on the two teams were<br />\nnot as closely contested this year as<br />\nis usually the case, owing to the fact<br />\nthat the tryouts were held immediately before the Christmas examinations. The members of the Junior team, which will champion the<br />\naffirmative of the question, are A. A.<br />\nSteinbach, chairman; A. A. Weech<br />\nand Randolph Smith, while the Senior debaters are T. J. Tingley, chairman; G. Franklin Ludington and<br />\nHarrison C. Coffin. Mr. C.

Rushton Fairclough,<br />\nformerly a director in the American<br />\nAcademy at Rome and now a<br />\nmember of the faculty of Stanford<br />\nUniversity. Professor Faircloug-h's<br />\ntopic, \"City Planning in Ancient<br />\nRome,\" was in a way a sequel to<br />\nhis former lecture given here on<br />\nthe three beautiful capitals of the<br />\nworld\u2014Athens, Rome and Washington.<br />\n\"City planning,\" he said, \"is not<br />\na new development; the first public<br />\nbasilica having been built in 185 B.<br />\nC., and the first arch in 121 B. C.<br />\nBut though Rome had its forum<br />\nbefore the time of Cesar, the first<br />\nefforts toward a well-planned city<br />\nand civic center originated with<br />\nhim. He sought to make the forum<br />\nmore symmetrical and to enlarge it<br />\nfor the demands which would be<br />\nplaced upon it as the chief public<br />\nplace of the imperial city. A walled<br />\ncity in the midst of the activities of<br />\nthe city proper, the forum was a<br />\nplace set apart suitable for special<br />\nfunctions, where the orators spoke,<br />\nfrom which the emperors sent forth<br />\nthe generals and governors of the<br />\nempire, and where many religious<br />\ncelebrations were held.<br />\n\"Cxsar also first attempted the<br />\nbeautification of the Campus Martins and devoted himself to the construction of such massive public<br />\nstructures as the Circus Maximus<br />\nand the Basilica Julia. The system<br />\nof parks and public places thus inaugurated was advanced by the succeeding emperors, notably Augustus, Vespasian, Nerva and Trajan.\"<br />\nProfessor Fairclough closed his<br />\nlecture by calling attention to the<br />\nlarge part classical architecture has<br />\nplayed in America's model city of<br />\nthe Panama-Pacific Exposition. Its<br />\nwalled effect, with courts dominated<br />\nby a public building, is reminiscent<br />\nof the forums, while a number of<br />\nthe palaces are reproductions of the<br />\nRoman Thermae.

As a matter of fact,<br />\nevery man at Hopkins ought to take<br />\na personal interest in the Senior annual. It is not the record of the<br />\naccomplishments of the graduating<br />\nclass alone: it is typical of the University as a whole. There is no<br />\nHopkins activity, from football to<br />\nchess, that is not given its adequate<br />\nplace and reCorded all due honor between its covers. The Hullabaloo is<br />\ntypical of Hopkins life and of Hopkins men.<br />\nThe Board this year has done<br />\neverything in its power to make the<br />\nbook the best that has ever been<br />\nissued by a Hopkins graduating<br />\nclass. They have secured the services of the ablest engravers in the<br /><br />\ncountry, and the photographic work<br />\nis of the highest quality. Advance<br />\nindications are to the effect that the<br />\n1916 book will be the \"best ever.\"<br />\nBut the Board can only create a<br />\ngood Hullabaloo; they can not make<br />\nit a success. That is the manifest<br />\nduty of every man at the University.<br />\nThere is no reason why the Hopkins annual should not occupy a<br />\nposition among \u2022 the best college<br />\nyearbooks published in the country.<br />\nIt should be a matter of pride with<br />\nHopkins men to make it occupy<br />\nsuch a position.<br />\nThe 1916 benefit will be held Friday night, January 21, at Ford's.<br />\nDon't give up too early in your attempt to sell the Senior tickets. And<br />\nby all means be on hand Friday<br />\nnight to make it a real Hopkins<br />\nnight, and not a hopeless \"flareback.\"<br />\nSENIORS ELECT DR.

M., in<br />\nRoom I I, Dr. John Holladay Latane, professor of history of the<br />\nUniversity faculty, was elected honorary president of the seniors. A<br />\nlarge number of candidates were<br />\nnominated for the position, and<br />\nafter some elimination, Dr. Latane<br />\nwas chosen.<br />\nAn address concerning the coming senior benefit at \"Rolling<br />\nStones,\" on the night of January<br />\n21, was made by Mr. McDowell,<br />\nthe chairman of the benefit committee, who urged the members of the<br />\nclass to do their best to make the<br />\naffair a success and so to insure.<br />\nthe success of their Hullabaloo.<br />\nWORK ON CIVIL ENGINEERING<br />\nBUILDING WELL UNDER WAY<br /><br />\nIn spite of the bad weather, considerable progress has been made<br />\non the new Civil Engineering Building at Homewood during the holidays. The excavation has been<br />\ncompleted and the concrete foundations and the lower brick walls<br />\nare now being laid.<br />\nThe contract calls for the completion of the building by August 15,<br />\nand unless the winter is extremely<br />\nsevere it should be finished on time.<br />\nThe style of the new building will<br />\nbe colonial, thus conforming with<br />\nthe other structures. In appearance it will be very much like the<br />\npresent Electrical and Mechanical<br />\nBuilding, which it will face. A<br />\nstriking difference, however, will<br />\nbe found in the part corresponding<br />\nto Machinery Hall and in the wings.<br />\nIn their place a large lecture room<br />\nor auditorium will be built in the<br />\ncenter of the back.
