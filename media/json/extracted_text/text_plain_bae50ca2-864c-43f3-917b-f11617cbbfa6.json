That the<br />\nProduct was a representation of<br />\nthis institution could be discerned, not from the factual accuracy of the content, but rather<br />\nfrom the architectural resemblance between the site of the<br />\ndrama and the Homewood camPus. It would appear that any<br />\nOther similarity was not by design, but purely coincidental.<br />\nAside from the technical faults,<br />\nWhich in themselves are gross<br />\nenough to warrant relegating the<br />\nentire strip to the cutting-room<br />\nfloor, the film is guilty of only<br />\none other crime\u2014that of blatant misrepresentation.

The uproarious laughter<br />\nwith which it was greeted, is indeed grim testimony to the obvious fraud. Derision is not an<br />\nunusual reaction to seeing one's<br />\nfriends and associates in an obviously fictitious situation. To<br />\nvery few in fact did the film picture the truth with which they<br />\nare familiar and of which they are<br />\nproud.<br />\nFuthermore, in attempting to<br />\ninterest possible applicants for<br />\nadmission, the film could only appeal to that variety of student who<br />\nwould be better situated at an<br />\ninstitution more in keeping with<br />\nthe country club atmosphere that<br />\n<br />\nwas created, rather than with the<br />\ncommendable realities and potentialities of The Hopkins.

That the<br />\nProduct was a representation of<br />\nthis institution could be discerned, not from the factual accuracy of the content, but rather<br />\nfrom the architectural resemblance between the site of the<br />\ndrama and the Homewood camPus.

The uproarious laughter<br />\nwith which it was greeted, is indeed grim testimony to the obvious fraud. Derision is not an<br />\nunusual reaction to seeing one's<br />\nfriends and associates in an obviously fictitious situation. To<br />\nvery few in fact did the film picture the truth with which they<br />\nare familiar and of which they are<br />\nproud.<br />\nFuthermore, in attempting to<br />\ninterest possible applicants for<br />\nadmission, the film could only appeal to that variety of student who<br />\nwould be better situated at an<br />\ninstitution more in keeping with<br />\nthe country club atmosphere that<br /><br />\nwas created, rather than with the<br />\ncommendable realities and potentialities of The Hopkins.
