And the parallel question<br />\nof the academic environment: the<br />\nsize of the faculty, the quality of<br />\nthe program, and so on, and I'm<br />\nsure that he wants to address<br />\nthose. He really has no alternative<br />\nbut to do that. . . . I am sure the<br />\nquestion of the quality of the curriculum will be brought to his attention by students, both graduate<br />\nand undergraduate, if not by<br />\nfaculty and deal's.<br />\nN-L: Penn State is a land grant<br />\nnstitution; community and state<br />\n-elations are paramount. Do you<br />\ncorsee any difficulties for Dr.<br />\nRichardson adjusting to the new<br />\nmvironment at Hopkins?<br />\nSM: The direct answer to your<br />\niuesiton is no. . . . First and most<br />\nimportant, there really isn't any<br />\nother place like Johns Hopkins,<br />\nand I do think that there is a<br />\nchallenge in getting to know and<br />\nunderstand and get a feeling for<br />\nHopkins. I think he knows that<br />\nperfectly well, and I think he<br />\ndoesn't need any special advice,<br />\nbut obviously he is going to make<br />\nthe same effort any new president<br />\nwould make to get to know this<br />\nplace and understand it. . . . The<br />\nreason that I say no to your question is because I think the<br />\nexperience he's had as provost at<br />\nPenn State was, I'm sure, very<br />\nuseful. . . . There are aspects of<br />\nthe Penn State experience that<br />\nare, in fact, very relevant. Penn<br />\nState has become a system; it isn't<br />\njust a college. I think they have<br />\nover 20 branches or campuses.<br />\nAnd that will help him with the<br />\ngeographic and administrative<br />\ndecentralization of Johns<br />\nHopkins. Also, in terms of governance, while the regents at Penn<br />\nState are chosen in a different<br />\nway than the trustees are here,<br />\nonce they are there, the relationships with the board tend to be<br />\nlargely the same whether the institution is private or public. The<br />\nmain thing is he has extensive experience in research universities<br />\nand that's essential. . . I think the<br />\ntransition to Hopkins is always an<br />\nadventure for anybody because<br />\nHopkins is a special place.<br />\n<br />\nN-L: Considering that Hopkins is<br />\na prominent university, located in<br />\na city with one of the nation's<br />\nlargest black populations, how do<br />\nl'ou account for the lack of any<br />\nAfro-American studies at<br />\nHopkins?<br />\nSM: Well, I think you have to<br />\nsort of think about the context in<br />\nwhich Hopkins is located and<br />\noperates. I can't say that<br />\neverything we have done is right,<br />\nbut I think as you ask that question one has to think about the<br />\nrelationship of Hopkins to an institution such as Morgan State<br />\nUniversity, to the other<br />\npredominantly black institutions,<br />\nin the area. . . and also to the<br />\noverall situation in the city and<br />\nregion. My own feeling is that<br />\nHopkins over time can and should<br />\ndo more with Morgan. I am<br />\nreally<br />\npleased that we got this collaborative program in space<br />\nresearch which is shared with<br />\nMorgan, and if we can begin to<br />\nwork that out we can strengthen<br />\nour relationship with Morgan in<br />\nfields such as engineering. . .<br />\nWe've also made an effort to<br />\nincrease minority enrollment,<br />\nparticularly black enrollment, and<br />\nI think we've got to continue that.<br />\nI think you could ask why<br />\nHopkins doesn't have an art<br />\ndepartment, and the reason is that<br />\nthere is the Maryland Institute<br />\nCollege of Art; we don't have a<br />\nmusic department because<br />\nPeabody is there. And I don't<br />\nthink we could do as good a job<br />\nof Afro-American studies department as Morgan can do.<br />\nThe following question comes<br />\nfrom the Women's Center. The<br />\nreport submitted by the Human<br />\nClimate Task Force referred to<br />\nproblems experienced at this<br />\nuniversity by womeei and<br />\nminorities that were unique and<br />\nexceptionally acute. How is the<br />\nadministration addressing the<br />\nhuman climate issue, and why<br />\nhaven't the steps taken reached<br />\nthe level of the students.<br />\nSM: Well, we've taken that<br />\nreport very seriously land] given<br />\nit a lot of attention, but there are<br />\ncertain priorities that we can address as a central administration<br />\nand the biggest focus has been the<br />\nquestion of day care. . . . That's<br />\nan example of where we have immediately given a priority and<br />\nwhere the central administration<br />\nhas a real voice. . . . The question<br />\nof how we reach student levels is<br />\none that at Hopkins really has not<br />\nbeen a province of the central<br />\nadministration, the central administration doesn't have students<br />\n<br />\nand that's, at Hopkins, a question<br />\nfor the divisions. If a report is<br />\nmade that points to problems at<br />\nHopkins, and that report is supported by and sponsored by the<br />\ncentral administration, then in<br />\norder for it to be effective it has<br />\nto be digested and addressed in<br />\nthe divisions. That's the best and<br />\nonly way this place can really<br />\nwork. And that takes time. . . .<br />\nN-L: You stated last year that you<br />\nwere planning to devote your remaining time to raising money to<br />\nincrease Arts and Sciences 's endowment. What progress has<br />\nbeen made?<br />\nSM: Well, that turns out to be at<br />\nthis point a more embarrasing<br />\nquestion than I would like. In this<br />\nsense, first, if you look at annual<br />\ngiving to Arts and Sciences and<br />\noverall giving, there have really<br />\nbeen wonderful increases. I think<br />\nthe annual giving in Arts and<br />\nSciences ahs gone up 50 percent.<br />\nThose are mostly small gifts, so<br />\nthe dollars are not overwhelming,<br />\nbut the 50 percent increase in any<br />\nyear is a very desirable thing<br />\nbecause usually the problem is<br />\nnot to hold levels of support but<br />\nto increase them. The overall giving to Arts and Sciencetwent up<br />\nlast year something like 20 percent. That's larger dollars and not<br />\npart of the annual giving program<br />\nas such, but that's also a very<br />\nwelcome development.<br />\nThe reason I say that it's a<br />\nlittle embarrassing for me to go<br />\nfurther is because the trustees<br />\nhave decided that they're in effect going to sponsor an effort to<br />\nget some gifts more or less as a<br />\ntribute to me and they asked me<br />\nif they did that, where would I<br />\nlike that money to be directed and<br />\nI have asked them and they've<br />\nagreed that such funds should be<br />\nan endowment for Arts and<br />\nSciences. But, obviously, I'm not<br />\nengaged in raising money as a<br />\ntribute to me; other people are<br />\ndoing that.<br />\nN-L: How do you accountfor the<br />\nrelative decline of the MSE as a<br />\ncompetitive research library at a<br />\nuniversity which characterizes<br />\nitself as one of the nation's<br />\npremier research institutes?<br />\nSM: The problem that you allude<br />\nto is a problem that is not exactly unique to the MSE. What we<br />\nare looking at is that there has<br />\nbeen an explosion for the past 30<br />\nor 40 years in publications in the<br />\nform of journals, and the<br />\nlibrarians call that serials. The<br />\ncost of these journals is rising<br />\nmuch, much faster than the consumer price index, particularly at<br />\na world-class university where so<br />\n<br />\nmany of the journals are printed<br />\nabroad. The dollar has declined<br />\nby about half in the past five years<br />\nagainst, for example, the German<br />\nmark, the Japanese yen. . . .

I feel very blessed because instead if having died<br />\nor gotten sick in this job, the prospect is that I will walk out. . .<br />\nstill feeling very vigorous and<br />\nvery good and, as far as I know,<br />\nhealthy. That means that my first<br />\npriority is to make the most of ths<br />\nprivilege of having discretion as<br />\nto what I do. What I would like<br />\nto do is to keep very busy,<br />\nbecause I have no intention of<br />\nretiring in the sense of doing<br />\nnothing or doing less. I think that<br />\nwould drive me crazy; it would<br />\nprobably kill me. But I'm going<br />\nto be doing a variety of things that<br />\nI want to do. A few because I've<br />\nbeen asked to do them, and a few<br />\nthat I really want to do. I do want<br />\nto write a book. I know that I will<br />\nbe doing some consulting and<br />\nthere is one major, not full-time,<br />\nbut one major activity that I probably will be engaged in. . . [but]<br />\nI'm really not free to go into<br />\ndetail. Something that people<br />\nsometimes forget is that I didn't<br />\nstart out in life with the intention<br />\nof becoming a university president. I started out with the intention of becoming a professor and<br />\nI became one, and in some ways<br />\nI was not so bad at that. . . . I<br />\nwould like to plan over a longer<br />\nperiod than next year or even the<br />\nyear after to go back to teaching<br />\neither on a part-time or full-time<br />\nbasis.

Many<br />\ninstructors teaching during the<br />\nregular year will return for summer classes.<br />\nTwo five week sessions are offered, one starting June 4 and one<br />\nstarting July 9. Students can take<br />\na maximum of two classes each<br />\n3y<br />\n<br />\nsession. All classes of \"Hopkins<br />\nSummer '90\" are day classes, but<br />\nthe School of Continuing Studies<br />\nwill continue to offer its traditional summer evening program.<br />\nCourse offerings run the gamut,<br />\nfrom chemistry and physics to occidental civilization, foreign<br />\nlanguages and psychology.<br />\nMost of the courses being offered are entry-level freshman<br />\nand sophomore courses, many of<br />\nwhich can be used to fulfill<br />\nmedical school requirements. \"<br />\nIn addition to targeting<br />\nHopkins' students, the School of<br />\nContinuing Studies plans to send<br />\n14,000 course catalogs to<br />\nstudents at other universities in<br />\nthe Middle Atlantic region.<br />\nAlso for the fourth year, the<br />\nsummer session will offer a precollege program to high school<br />\nstudents. \"Hopkins has so much<br />\nto offer these young students as<br />\na university.

He added that, although<br />\nissues such as inadequate minority representation on the student<br />\ncouncil remain unresolved, \"the<br />\nadministration has sincerely tried<br />\nto work out the problems.\"<br />\n\"Richardson thinks diversity<br />\n[in the student body] is important,\" said Martin. Under<br />\nRichardson's tenure, Penn State<br />\nincreased financial aid to its<br />\nminority students. The university has also developed close ties<br />\nwith two local black colleges,<br />\nLincoln and Chaney Universities.<br />\nThis involvement allows for<br />\nfaculty exchanges and special<br />\nconsideration for student transfers<br />\n<br />\nto Penn State.<br />\nMartin was uniformly positive<br />\nabout Richardson, except when<br />\nquestioned about the condition of<br />\nthe Arts and Sciences at Penn<br />\nState.<br />\n\"Four or five years ago a decision was made about the<br />\nengineering program,\" Martin<br />\nsaid. Penn State expanded the<br />\nengineering school at the expense<br />\nof Arts and Sciences, as well as<br />\nthe architecture program, he said.<br />\n\"It's hard to say whether<br />\nRichardson or [Penn State President] Jordan were responsible,\"<br />\nhe said.<br />\nMartin hastened to add.<br />\nhowever, that the Planning and<br />\nBudget Advisory Committee had<br />\ncome to the conclusion this past<br />\nfall that there was \"a great need\"<br />\nfor improvements in the Arts and<br />\nSciences. Richardson supported<br />\nthe committee's conclusion, Martin said.<br />\nPenn State and Johns Hopkins<br />\nhave one significant similarity,<br />\naccording to Martin; both universities are heavily research<br />\n<br />\nleave JHU<br />\nto<br />\nWJHU<br />\nStation offered to state of Maryland<br />\nWJHU, from 1<br />\nin this region.<br />\nAlso broadcast on the University station were performances<br />\nfrom the Baltimore Symphony<br />\nOrchestra,\u2022 Peabody and other<br />\nlocal groups. WJHU listeners<br />\neven enjoyed Baltimore's only<br />\naccess to such programs as the<br />\nBBC World News.<br />\nRunning these national and international programs cost WJHU<br />\ntoo much money. however.<br />\nFinancial problems were the<br />\nprimary reasons that the radio station may be turned over to the<br />\nstate.<br />\n\"1 think we would not be as<br />\ngood a station if we did not have<br />\nthe national public radio subscription, but [the subscriptions have]<br />\nsomething like doubled in cost<br />\nover the last three or four years,\"<br />\nsaid Muller. \"We got ourselves<br />\noverbudgeted by carrying them.\"<br />\nMuller explained that the needs<br />\nof other Hopkins programs are<br />\n\"higher priorities\" than the radio<br />\nstation.<br />\n\"At this point it would be<br />\nwonderful if we could continue<br />\nWJHU, but when you're looking<br />\nat some of the needs we have in<br />\nthe library, in Arts and Sciences,<br />\nthe whole Peabody problem, we<br />\nreally can't afford to spend that<br />\nmoney,\" President Muller said.<br />\nBecause the University borrowed heavily to purchase state-ofthe-art broadcasting equipment<br />\nfor WJHU, simply closing the<br />\nstation would mean that Hopkins<br />\nwould still be paying over a<br />\nmillion dollars in debt service<br />\nover the next ten years. Rather<br />\nthan close down the station,<br />\nUniversity officials decided that<br />\nit would he better for Hopkins<br />\nand the Baltimore community if<br />\nWJHU were simply turned over<br />\nto the state. That way, while<br />\nHopkins would pay $250,000 annually in debt payments while the<br />\nstate, under a separate accord<br />\nwith the University of Maryland<br />\nat College Park, would actually<br />\nrun the station.<br />\n\"The state, if it took the station over for Maryland Public<br />\nBroadcasting, would not pay<br />\nHopkins one red cent, but they<br />\nwould assume the lease for the<br />\nIWIHU1 property down at 22nd<br />\nand Charles,\" said Muller. \"If<br />\nwe just closed the station, we<br />\nwould have the financial burden<br />\nof the lease, which is annually<br />\nbigger than the debt service on<br />\nthe equipment.\"<br />\nBecause of this, Muller<br />\nbelieves that \"it's a better deal for<br />\nus than closing the station\u2014<br />\nfinancially and spiritually.\"<br />\n\"We wouldn't have to fire<br />\nanybody, a public servic.. we've<br />\nbeen rendering will be taken over<br />\nby somebody else and they',I take<br />\nover the lease because it's then<br />\ntheir operation,\" Muller said.<br />\nMuller stressed, however, that<br />\nHopkins has no further authority<br />\nin the acquisition matter at this<br />\npoint<br />\n\"The question is: will the<br />\nlegislature agree [to the transaction] and will the governor of<br />\nMaryland Public Broadcasting<br />\n<br />\nfollow through on taking it over?<br />\nIf they don't, then I think we'll<br />\nhave to close the station. That<br />\nwould be sad and would deprive<br />\nthe community of a service\u2014and<br />\nwould cost us somewhat more<br />\nthan if the [state acquisition] happens.\"<br />\n<br />\noriented. It is also true that many<br />\nstudents at both universities feel<br />\nthat undergraduate education suffers at the expense of the heavy<br />\nresearch drive.<br />\n\"Most undergraduates say that<br />\nresearch gets too much attention.\" said Martin.<br />\n\"There are times when<br />\nresearch is overemphasized,\"<br />\ncontinued Althaus, \"but under<br />\nRichardson, the undergraduates<br />\nwere not completely ignored.\"<br />\nRichardson, she said, \"looks to<br />\nthe undergraduates as much as the<br />\nacademic<br />\nfinancial<br />\nand<br />\nconcerns.\"<br />\nLou Giangiulio, Student Council president and member of the<br />\nPresidential Search Committee at<br />\nHopkins, had this to say about<br />\nRichardson: \"He was the most<br />\ngenuinely interested in student affairs [of all the presidential<br />\napplicants].\"<br />\nGiangiulio also said that<br />\nRichardson had done his<br />\nhomework extremely well in<br />\npreparation for the interviews,<br />\nanswering detailed questions<br />\nabout Peabody and other institutions, and even making specific<br />\nsuggestions. He said that<br />\nRichardson seemed to lack<br />\ncharisma in the first round of<br />\npresidential interviews, but, once<br />\nthe process was underway,<br />\n\"warnied up,\" and displayed real<br />\nenthusiasm and even a sense of<br />\nhumor.<br />\n\"He't not Mr. Dynamism, but<br />\nafter a while he grows on you,\"<br />\nGiangiulio said.<br />\n<br />\nWSLEeTTE:Ci<br />\nNew president naNEM<br />\nRICHARDSON, from 1<br />\nson will choose successors to<br />\nProvost Lombardi, Vice President for Medicine Richard Ross,<br />\nand Dean of the School of<br />\nHygiene and Public Health<br />\nDonald Henderson.<br />\nAt Richardson's first Hopkins<br />\npress conference, he stated that<br />\nhis top priority in office will be<br />\nthe actual and psychological wellbeing of students and members of<br />\nthe faculty. One of the main<br />\nreasons for his selection as<br />\npresident was apparently his<br />\ndedication to undergraduate<br />\neducation. Richardson, however,<br />\nplaced much of his emphasis on<br />\nthe faculty throughout the press<br />\nconference. He was particularly<br />\nproud of his success at retaining<br />\nPenn State faculty members.<br />\n\"We're going to have to make<br />\nsure that our faculty know that we<br />\ncare a lot that they're at Hopkins<br />\nand we want them to stay.\"<br />\nRichardson hopes to encourage<br />\ncloser working relationships<br />\nbetween - the divisions of the<br />\nuniversity, particularly between<br />\nthe medical school and the<br />\nundergraduate schools of Arts<br />\nand Sciences and Engineering.<br />\nHe cited the overlap between the<br />\nschools in the departments of<br />\nBiophysics and Biomedical<br />\nEngineering and plans to institute<br />\nan interdivisional faculty council<br />\nwith a greater say in university<br />\n<br />\nmatters than the faculty currently enjoys.<br />\nRichaMson's second priority is<br />\ncommunity relations\u2014a hallmark<br />\nof his years of service at two<br />\npublic universities, Penn State<br />\nand Washington State. Richardson has already met with<br />\nMaryland Governor William<br />\nDonald Schaefer in an effort to<br />\nbuttress Hopkins' relationship<br />\nwith the state.<br />\nHis third concern is fundraising, particularly for the<br />\nfinancially strapped Arts and<br />\nSciences division. Unlike President Muller, he opposes using the<br />\npresident's discretionary fund to<br />\nbridge the gaps in the Arts and<br />\nSciences budget, saying that the<br />\nonly real solution is to raise the<br />\nschool's endowment.<br />\nRichardson shied away from<br />\nthe image of the president as the<br />\nchief fund-raiser and financial officer, emphasizing instead his<br />\nacademic concerns. He would offer no specific comments on the<br />\nUniversity's Five-Year Plan or<br />\non other budgetary matters.<br />\nRichardson says that he needs<br />\nmore time to study issues such as<br />\nthe budget and the future of the<br />\nApplied Physics Laboratory and<br />\nthe Peabody Conservatory before<br />\ncoming out with definite plans.<br />\n\"I'm still speaking as an outsider,\" he said, \"and I won't be<br />\nhere, really, until July 1.\"<br />\n<br />\nThe Office of News and Information Services released the<br />\nfollowing biographical sketch of<br />\nRichardson:<br />\nDr. Richardson was named Executive Vice President at The<br />\nPennsylvania State University effective July 1, 1984.

The new layout<br />\nwill have primarily doubles.<br />\n\"I think a lot of people who<br />\nhave had a taste of having their<br />\nown rooms will have trouble with<br />\nit.\" said one resident. She added that current freshmen will probably be more happy with the<br />\nnew dorms for both the security<br />\nand convenience they offer.<br />\nOther students echoed this comment, suggesting that the renovations would \"make the school<br />\neven more popular. . . it'll make<br />\nfor a more campus-like<br />\n-tmosphere.\"<br />\nDorothy Fleming, Assistant<br />\nDirector for Residential Life,<br />\nagreed with the strongly positive<br />\nresponse to the renovation plans,<br />\nbut expressed some concern<br />\nabout the proposed lease arrangements for the Bradford<br />\nApartments.<br />\n\"I really like the plans.

There are<br />\nrecommendations included which<br />\nadvise fraternities to have the fire<br />\nmarshall determine the maximum<br />\ncapacity of their houses and to<br />\nlimit house parties to brothers or<br />\nto close friends. According to<br />\nboth Lee Kaplan and Dean<br />\nBoswell, there will be \"no new<br />\nrules about house rules,\" but the<br />\nrecommendations are included in<br />\nlight of the changed off-campus<br />\nclimate.<br />\nAfter meeting with the University's general counsel, both Dean<br />\nBoswell and Bill Smedick decided to end the practice of supplying a cover letter to fraternities<br />\nseeking a one-day liquor license<br />\nfor off-campus parties. According to Dean Boswell, the new<br />\nadministration at the Baltimore<br />\nCity Liquor Board is interpreting<br />\nthese cover letters as resting a<br />\ncertain amount of responsibility<br />\nwith the University which it was<br />\nnot willing to accept in situations<br />\nwhere the University lacked control. As Bill Smedick explained,<br />\nthe previous Board administration<br />\nhad used the cover letter as \"one<br />\namong several determining factors.\" \"University lawyers felt<br />\n<br />\nthat there was too much risk in<br />\nan uncontrollable situation,\" he<br />\nadded.<br />\nThe lack of cover letters means<br />\nthat the Liquor Board will not<br />\nissue fraternities one-day liquor<br />\nlicenses, making off-campus parties, at least of the traditional size<br />\nand scope, extremely difficult.<br />\n\"[You] can't have large, unruly<br />\nparties anymore,\" said Bill<br />\nSmedick. Lee Kaplan pointed out<br />\nthat problems of police, the liquor<br />\nboard, carding, and community<br />\nmake off-campus parties a problem at this point.<br />\nAccording to Aaron Stansbury<br />\nof the Baltimore City Liquor<br />\nBoard, the reason the board will<br />\nnot grant liquor licenses, at all,<br />\nto Hopkins fraternities stems<br />\nfrom an agreement that the<br />\nUniversity arranged, seven to<br />\neight years ago, with the previous<br />\nboard administration, requesting<br />\nthat no student organization be<br />\ngiven a liquor license without a<br />\ncover letter. Citing this agreement, Mr. Stansbury explained<br />\nthat fraternities were considered<br />\n\"an arm of the university.\" This<br />\nrestriction, said Mr. Stansbury,<br />\ndoes not extend to the other colleges under the board's jurisdiction. He also made it clear that<br />\nif it was indicated to him that the<br />\n<br />\nagreement were ended, then<br />\nfraternity requests for liquor<br />\nlicenses might have to go through<br />\npublic hearings, where community complaints with some Greek<br />\norganizations might not help in<br />\nthe process. But the original<br />\nagreement, Mr. Stansbury noted,<br />\nwas the result of \"the change in<br />\nthe law for minors in that period\"<br />\nand was requested as a means of<br />\n\"exercising control.\" He expressed skepticism about the<br />\npolicing system of monitors at<br />\nfraternity parties.<br />\nDean Boswell and Bill Smedick<br />\nboth are recommending oncampus activities. Bill Smedick<br />\nhopes to see \"smaller events in<br />\nthe community and larger events,<br />\nwhere there were community<br />\nrelations problems, on campus.\"<br />\n\"It's not as if we said 'too bad',\"<br />\nstated Dean Boswell. \"We're<br />\nsurrounded by campus here<br />\n[Levering Hair making larger<br />\nparties possible. In her view, the<br />\nmove \"strengthens\" fraternities<br />\nin \"assisting them to control it<br />\nthemselves. The only difference<br />\nis that it's less likely that<br />\nunderage people will be able to<br />\nget alcohol.\"<br />\nLee Kaplan feels that for certain fraternities, it is a positive<br />\nstep since a lot of complaints are<br />\n<br />\nbased just on noise. \"For others,<br />\nit's gonna' be kinda' tough. People are going to have smaller<br />\nparties.\"<br />\nAs for initial feedback from the<br />\nfraternities, Lee Kaplan said that<br />\n\"a few are disturbed at the initial<br />\nactions. . . people are a little skeptical.\" A one-day conference was<br />\nheld in January \"to develop<br />\nideas,\" according to Bill<br />\nSmedick. People were not only<br />\nresponding but asking \"what we<br />\ncan do\" and looking for ways to<br />\nclean up their acts.<br />\n\"Policies are okay for what<br />\nthey're worth, but there needs to<br />\nbe more education,\" stated Bill<br />\nSmedick, citing an instance of<br />\nalcohol poisoning in a residence<br />\nhall already this semester.<br />\nIn addition, Bill Smedick feels<br />\nthat there is little knowledge of<br />\nfraternity volunteerism. Dean<br />\nBoswell suggested that Greek<br />\norganizations<br />\ndemonstrate<br />\nresponsibility by becoming<br />\nvisibly involved in the<br />\ncommunity.<br />\nLee Kaplan surmises the<br />\noverall situation as a period of<br />\nchange. \"This is [an] area where<br />\nthings are coming off of a period<br />\nof change.\" Conflict, he said, is<br />\ninevitable.<br />\n<br />\nNew<br />\nH-master<br />\nMcCoy welcomes Evitts<br />\n<br />\nCollege officials split on alcohol policies<br />\nSeven years alter most states<br />\nincreased the legal drinking age<br />\nto 21, college officials are still<br />\nwrestling with how to respond.<br />\nSome are trying to Qtamp out<br />\nunderage drinking on tneir campuses, while others say a more<br />\nrealistic approach is to<br />\nacknowledge that students use<br />\nalcohol and to encourage them<br />\nnot to abuse it.<br />\nSome administrators argue that<br />\ntelling underage students to drink<br />\n\"responsibly\" encourages them<br />\nto flout the law. Those administrators believe universities<br />\nshould strictly prohibit alcohol<br />\nconsumption by such students.<br />\nOthers say the vast majority of<br />\nstudents would drink anyway.<br />\nWhile they agree that universities<br />\nshould not encourage students to<br />\nbreak the law, they believe institutions have a pressing obligation to persuade students to stop<br />\nshort of abuse.<br />\n<br />\nmpted some students to wait<br />\nlonger to begin drinking, almost<br />\nall say alcohol remains the most<br />\nwidely used drug among college<br />\nstudents. Violent incidents related<br />\nto its abuse\u2014ranging from date<br />\nrape to death\u2014continue to plague<br />\nmany campuses.<br />\n\"Alcohol is still the No. 1<br />\nsource of discipline problems and<br />\nother emotional or physical problems on campus,\" says Robert<br />\nF. Ariosto, dean of student affairs<br />\nat Central Connecticut State<br />\nUniversity. \"That's a fact that<br />\ndoesn't go away.\"<br />\nSome students say that raising<br />\nthe drinking age has not reduced<br />\ndrinking problems among young<br />\npeople. Instead, they say, it has<br />\nencouraged underages students<br />\nboth to go off campus to drink<br />\nand to use alcohol in larger<br />\namoutst when they do get hold of<br />\nit. Students on several campuses<br />\nof the University of Wisconsin<br />\nhave organized campaigns to<br />\npush state legislators to lower the<br />\ndrinking age, and students at<br />\nother institutions are considering<br />\nsimilar drives.<br />\n<br />\nState Laws Pose Problems<br />\n<br />\nCounselors at Rochester<br />\n<br />\nRegardless of which side<br />\nthey're on, almost all administrators agree that state laws<br />\nraising the drinking age to 21<br />\nhave made it difficult to set campuswide policies, since some<br />\nundergraduates can drink legally and others cannot.<br />\nWhile a few administrators say<br />\nthey believe the laws have pro-<br />\n<br />\nDennis O'Brien, president of<br />\nthe University of Rochester, is<br />\namong those who favor teaching<br />\nstudents to drink responsibly,<br />\nregardless of their age.

Alcohol education, he<br />\nbelieves, should be similar to the<br />\nsex education that many campus<br />\nhealth centers offer.<br />\n\"I hope we're not condoning<br />\ninappropriate sexuality,\" he says.<br />\n\"But the fact is, [students] do<br />\nengage in it and ought to know<br />\nwhat the risks are and how to<br />\nbehave so they don't get AIDS.\"<br />\nRoss J.

He said that he did not<br />\ninitially apply for the position of<br />\nHousemaster because he had been<br />\nplanning to spend his junior year<br />\nin Europe. However, he ended up<br />\nstaying at Hopkins, and when<br />\nthere was an opening for the position for Building B, he submitted<br />\nan application to the Office of<br />\nResidential Life. That opening<br />\nwas filled by Tom Brennan in October. A second opportunity arose<br />\nwhen<br />\nMatthew O'Brien resigned the<br />\nweek before Christmas.<br />\nWhen asked why he wanted to<br />\nbe a Housemaster, Evitts said, \"I<br />\nhad a good time freshman year.<br />\nI guess that in the hack of my<br />\nmind, I just wanted to transmit<br />\nthat to other people.\"<br />\nEvitts cited \"getting to know<br />\npeople\" as the most satisfying<br />\naspect of the job. \"It's amazing<br />\nthat I actually get paid for taking<br />\nthese people and doing things<br />\nwith them,\" said Evitts.<br />\nBut, being a mid-year replacement does have its share of disadvantages. \"It is quite challenging<br />\nbecause the freshmen are not so<br />\ndependent anymore. They are used to taking care of themselves.\"<br />\nEvitts, however, does not seem<br />\nto be confronted with the problem<br />\nof being accepted by McCoy<br />\nresidents, considering the<br />\nresponse that his introduction was<br />\ngiven at the first dorm meeting of<br />\nthe semester.<br />\nMike has also had support from<br />\nhis colleagues, Andrea Rose and<br />\nJeff Blitz, the other Housemasters<br />\nof McCoy.<br />\n<br />\nRegardless of which side of the<br />\ndebate they take, almost all college administrators agree that the<br />\nrise in the legal drinking age has<br />\nput them in a no-win situation. It<br />\ncreates an unnatural split in the<br />\nstudent population that makes setting and enforcing campus-wide<br />\nalcohol policies nearly impossible, they say.<br />\n\"It's awfully hard to control a<br />\nmixed-age group where some can<br />\ndrink and some can't, but all are<br />\nstudents,\" says Robin S. Wilson,<br />\npresident of California State<br />\nUniversity at Chico.<br />\nMr.<br />\nAdds Rochester's<br />\nconsumption<br />\nO'Brien: \"Since the<br />\nofulcohol is not in general an illegal activity\u2014unlike marijuana<br />\nor crack\u2014you have this bizarre<br />\nsituation where at the mystic age<br />\nof 21, suddenly people can drink<br />\nlegally when they couldn't the<br />\nday before.\"<br />\nOthers say that because<br />\nAmericans often treat the consumption of alcohol as a rite of<br />\npassage and becasue advertisements give drinking a<br />\nglamorous aura, colleges have a<br />\ntough time enforcing any<br />\npolicy\u2014whether they are pushing<br />\n<br />\n\"Andrea and Jeff are invaluable.<br />\nThe living situation in McCoy is<br />\nnot comparable to other dorms;<br />\nthere are three Housemasters.

It's really a<br />\nmatter of people working with<br />\npeople.\" continued Evitts.<br />\nAbout the residents of McCoy,<br />\nEvitts commented that although<br />\nthe freshmen are quite independent, there is a remarkable sense<br />\nof unity among them. \"It's really surprising because they don't<br />\nshare bathrooms or anything, as<br />\nin the dorms,\" observes Evitts,<br />\nreferring to the apartment-style<br />\nliving arrangements in McCoy.<br />\nSo far, Evitts has collaborated<br />\nwirh Rose and Blitz on one major dorm event, the Superbowl<br />\nparty. With this event already<br />\nunder his belt, Evitts is optimistic<br />\nabout future activities.<br />\nHe believes that these activities<br />\nshould be based on mutual decisions between the freshmen and<br />\nthe Housemasters. \"I would like<br />\nto get some feedback from<br />\nresidents on what they want.\"<br />\nEvitts's future plans for the<br />\nfreshmen include road trips to<br />\nlacrosse games and small group<br />\nexcursions to marketplaces near<br />\nthe Inner Harbor.<br />\nIn general, McCoy residents<br />\nare not antagonistic towards the<br />\nnew situation. McCoy has not<br />\nsuffered from the turmoil that<br />\nplagued Building B after their<br />\nHousemaster's resignation. According to Andrea Rose, Matt<br />\nO'Brien's resignation was totally voluntary. \"He just had too<br />\nmany personal obligations to<br />\nfulfill this semester.\" O'Brien<br />\ncould not be reached for<br />\ncomment.<br />\n<br />\nfor abstinence or for responsible<br />\ndrinking.<br />\nLong-Term Effects Seen<br />\nProponents of the rise in the<br />\ndrinking age acknowledge that<br />\nthe laws have created some problems on campuses. But they say<br />\nthe change has prompte administrators to make students<br />\nmore aware of the dangers of<br />\nalcohol abuse. And they believe<br />\nthat over the long term the laws<br />\nwill curb drinking among young<br />\npeople. A survey at the University of Minnesota-Twin Cities<br />\nfound that after the drinking age<br />\nwent up, fewer 18-and-19-year<br />\nold students reported that they<br />\ndrank alcoholic beverages.<br />\n\"I think our expectations might<br />\nbe too high,\" says South<br />\nCarolina's Mr. Dorton, who<br />\npredicts that problems will<br />\ndiminish the longer the laws are<br />\nin effect. \"I think raising the<br />\ndrinking age was intended to<br />\nshow long-term effects, and<br />\nwe're seeing some of the<br />\npsychology involved in the law<br />\nbeing borne out: Kids'are waiting<br />\nlonger to start drinking.\"<br />\n<br />\nAPL tests missiles<br />\nby Steven Mizrach<br />\n<br />\nThe Johns Hopkins Applied<br />\nPhysics Laboratory has been involved in extensive testing for the<br />\nTrident II submarine-launched<br />\nmissile system for the Navy. Recent tests have been moderately<br />\nsuccessful, and the Navy has<br />\nstepped up production; however,<br />\nthere were several spectacular<br />\nfailures last summer. APL is<br />\nunder contract to evaluate and test<br />\nthe Trident II missile system. According to local peace activist<br />\nMax Obuziewski, \"Every black<br />\nbox containing all the trajectory<br />\ninformation on the Trident submarine is sent back to the APL<br />\nto be studied by the scientists<br />\nthere.\"<br />\nAs of 1987, the APL had three<br />\nseparate Trident contracts with<br />\nthe Navy: Strategic Weapons<br />\nSystem Evaluation, $4.9 million;<br />\nSonar, Command, and Control<br />\nSystem Evaluation, $12.5<br />\n<br />\nmillion; Trident I Backfit System<br />\nEvaluation, $12.3 million. The<br />\nfirst program's parameters are<br />\ndescribed as covering \"the<br />\nNavy's operational tests and<br />\nevaluation of the Trident II<br />\nsystem, and it addresses all<br />\naspects of system performance<br />\nexcept accuracy, which is<br />\nevaluated in another program,<br />\nand supporting the Navy in this<br />\narea APL generates data requirements, test plans and<br />\nanalyses. Then it assesses performance on the data so acquired.<br />\nAccording to another local<br />\npeace activist, Pat Birnie, \"The<br />\nTrident is clearly a first-strike<br />\nweapon, and its only purpose<br />\nwould be to pre-empt retaliation,<br />\nthat is, to unilaterally destroy the<br />\nenemy. And APL makes sure that<br />\nthe Trident is that much more<br />\nlethal.\" Many experts believe<br />\nthat \"first-strike\" nuclear<br />\nweapons are highly destabilizing,<br />\nespecially now that Soviet<br />\n<br />\nmilitary response is so<br />\nunpredictable.<br />\nThe Applied Physics Lab is<br />\ncompelled to carry on these tasks.<br />\nAccording to Nuclear Free<br />\nAmerica director Albert Donnay.<br />\n\"The contract with the Navy is<br />\nsuch that if the lab refuses their<br />\nresearch requests they may<br />\nassume control of it\u2014that's their<br />\nguarantee, that they can buy out<br />\nthe lab. The best that Hopkins can<br />\ndo is divest and let the Navy solely find researchers for their programs. But the nuclear weapons<br />\nwork will go on.\" Many opposition groups, including the APL<br />\nConversion Project, have come to<br />\naccept this, but still maintain that<br />\n\"it is not right for one of the nation's leading health care research<br />\ninstitutes to do such terrible<br />\nmilitary projects for the Department of Defense.\"<br />\n<br />\n\fBucknell threatens<br />\n<br />\nSC Minutes<br />\n<br />\n17<br />\nS<br />\nLETR<br />\nSa<br />\nE r<br />\nNf<br />\n<br />\nGreek dismantlement threatened<br />\n<br />\nby Jeff Perlstein<br />\nStudent Council Secretary<br />\nMuch of the discussion at this<br />\nweek's Student Council meeting<br />\nfocused on the work of the.<br />\nHomewood Schools Services Advisory Committee, specificially in<br />\nthe areas of housing and the<br />\nbookstore.

Not true\u2014after near<br />\nmental collapse, he does manage<br />\nUo obtain transportation to the airport It is not until he is trapped<br />\nin the car in the midst of rushhour traffic, however, that his<br />\nscheming friend at the wheel inform,him that he must buy her<br />\na drink upon their arrival at the<br />\nairport.<br />\n(Our story continues as our<br />\nhero, in a near-hypnotic daze,<br />\nfinds himself saying. \"Why, yes,<br />\nof course I'd love to buy you a<br />\ndrink when we get there, why<br />\nnot. I'm sure there'll be plenty of<br />\ntime.)<br />\nThe jerk on the emergency<br />\nbrake in the parking lot was all<br />\nthe running start I needed to propel myself down the deck to my<br />\ngate. I thought I had left my<br />\nfriend far behind, and I felt really awful, but\u2014well, actually. I<br />\ndidn't feel that bad, I sort of<br />\ndidn't care.<br />\nAnyway, I got to the gate, and<br />\nlanded at the check-in station'.<br />\nThe nices! flight attendant I have<br />\never met in my life pried my<br />\ngrimy, sweat-stained ticket out of<br />\nthe bouquet of muscle contraction<br />\nthat my hand had turned into,<br />\nchecked me in, and gave me my<br />\nseat, saying \"Thank you, please<br />\nhave a seat. We'll be boarding in<br />\njust a few minutes.\"<br />\nI took my ticket back, and turned around slowly, trying to regain<br />\ncontrol of myself.<br />\nMy friend was there. \"You<br />\nowe inc a drink,\" she said.<br />\nMany hundreds of years ago,<br />\nin anticipation of this day, a<br />\ngroup of people, hell-bent on my<br />\ndestruction, got together to do<br />\nfour things.<br />\n1 he first was, they invented<br />\nalcohol. This was so that my<br />\nfriend could ask me for a drink<br />\nin the first place.<br />\n<br />\nCensorshin and editorshi<br />\nMany people, reading the cartoon on page nine of the<br />\nHopkins Spectator (presumably our campus' counterpart<br />\nto the Dartmouth Review), may have mistakenly assumed that the artist's slam on the alleged shortcomings of<br />\nHopkins' female students was simply another expression<br />\ninsecure male misogyny. Yet to do so would be to<br />\nmisunderstand a subtle effort on the part of the Spectator<br />\nto draw our attention to serious shortcomings within the<br />\nuniversity.<br />\nIn the first panel of the strip, in which the cartoonist<br />\nrefers to Hopkins women as dogs, he is clearly trying to<br />\nconvey, in the verbal shorthand so prevalent here (orgo,<br />\nchem, 'Sems, etc.) that females at this institution are<br />\nUNDERdogs. For this cour-ageous stand he should be<br />\ncommended by all. Not even the administration is willing<br />\nto admit that the climate for women here can be so<br />\nnotoriously uncomfortable as to actually discourage them<br />\nfrom pursuing faculty positions.<br />\nThe complex \"2x + 1\"rule, laid out so cleverly in the<br />\ntwo boxes which follow the first, is self-evidently a twopronged strike at the underrepresentation of women on the<br />\nmath and science faculty, and a critique of the University's misleading policy of OVER-representing women in<br />\nglossy brochures promoting the school to the outside<br />\nworld. The charge that there may be a mathematical formula behind the latter practice is both astonishingly bold<br />\nand frightening in its implications. The last block of the<br />\ncartoon, in which it is noted that \"a little math and imagination goes a long way,\" is a skillful blending of these<br />\ntwo concepts. Not content to allow the strip to stop at this<br />\nalready impressive conclusion, however, the character in<br />\nthis sentence manages to mangle his grammar in a way<br />\nthat would make a fourth-grade teacher cringe, thereby<br />\ncondemning the inadequacies of the American educational<br />\nsystem.<br />\nTo be fair, however, the News-Letter must confess to<br />\nnot having an altogether clean record when it comes to<br />\n,promoting tolerance on campus, despite our aspirations<br />\n<br />\nto that end. Several times in the recent past, we published<br />\nstaff work which should not have been printed due to its<br />\nintolerant, demeaning characterizations of Hopkins<br />\nstudents. At the time we published them, we accepted an<br />\nargument that not to do so would be tantamount to censoring a point of view with which we did not agree. After<br />\nreflection, we realized that nothing could be further from<br />\nthe truth, and at the end of last term refused to run yet<br />\nanother example of terminal intolerance.<br />\nOur response to a charge of censorship is that all internal productions are subject to the same editorial<br />\nprerogatives that apply to anything else produced by the<br />\nNews-Letter staff. To deny the editorial board the right<br />\nto decide which internal productions are appropriate, and<br />\nwhich are not appropriate, for inclusion in the News-Letter,<br />\nis to make our jobs superfluous. At the same time, we do<br />\nnot edit outside contributions such as letters to the editor,<br />\nor Speaker's Corner contributions, for content. The<br />\ndistinction between editorship, the supervision of the internal policies or production of a publication, and censorship, by which we would refuse to publish anything we<br />\ndidn't like, is an important one. The sheer number of letters to the editor we print each week, often unfavorable<br />\nto us, attests to the fact that we do not presume to censor<br />\nthe Homewood campus, and that people realize this to be<br />\nthe case.<br />\nSexism and racism have no place on our campus, or in<br />\nthe News-Letter. Although we, of course, have no control<br />\nover letters to the editor and the like, nor would we want<br />\nsuch control, the News-Letter reserves the right to edit the<br />\ninternal productions of our own newspaper as we see fit.<br />\nTo do so is not to censor, but to be responsible editors.<br />\nIf we have failed to live up to this responsibility as fully<br />\nas we should have in the past, we apologize. We can only<br />\nhope that other publications will learn from our mistakes<br />\nas we have, and endeavor to make Johns Hopkins the haven<br />\nfrom prejudice, and its stablemate, ignorance, that this<br />\nUniversity should be.<br />\n<br />\nWelcome Richardson<br />\nThe News-Letter would like to take this opportunity to congratulate William C. Richardson, PhD, on his appointment<br />\nto the presidency of Johns Hopkins University. As of July 1 he will take on the sole responsibilty of heading one<br />\nof the nation's top research institutions. With Hopkins<br />\nlooking ahead to the twenty-first century, the opportunity<br />\nbefore Richardson is not only one of tremendous power<br />\nand prestige, but also one ripe with potential for change.<br />\nRichardson, on paper, appears to be tailor-made for the<br />\ntraditional Hopkins mentality. He comes from a university as vastly diversified as Hopkins; he has a public health<br />\nbackground, and he reveres the importance of research in<br />\neducation. Thus, an important question: Does this mean<br />\nArts and Sciences can look forward to a presidential tenure<br />\nmarked by indifference and disinterest?<br />\nWe don't think so.

In fact, in the<br />\nDecember 1 issue (just before<br />\nthey decided not to run the cartoon) the editors wrote a piece entitled \"Speak your mind at the<br />\nNews-Letter.\" The editors expressed their \"aspiration [for the<br />\nNews-Letter] to be a forum for<br />\nthis diverse university.\" In addition, they even set up a new column, a 'speaker's corner,' which<br />\nthey claimed would \"always be<br />\navailable to any group or individual who desires to verbalize<br />\nhis or her feelings on any issue.\"<br />\nThe editors concluded by proclaiming,\"We are, after all, your<br />\nstudent newspaper.\"<br />\nYet, in light of their decision<br />\nnot to run James Rosen's cartoon,<br />\none is forced to conclude that the<br />\neditors are, quite simply,<br />\nhypocrites. How can anyone take<br />\ntheir above claims seriously<br />\nwhen, in the very next issue, they<br />\nrefuse to print views of one of<br />\ntheir very own staff members.<br />\nSurely, James Rosen is an individual who desires to verbalize<br />\nhis feelings, yet he was not permitted by the editors to do so.<br />\nRegardless of the content of<br />\nJames Rosen's cartoon, or<br />\nanyone else's work for that matter, the editors were wrong not<br />\nto publish it. First, because they<br />\nopenly encouraged viewpoints on<br />\nthe editorial page, and second and<br />\n<br />\nmore importantly, because<br />\nsomething quite wonderful could<br />\nhave happened if they had<br />\npublished it. Someone might have<br />\nwritten in who had found the cartoon offensive and someone<br />\nmight have written in who had<br />\nnot found the cartoon offensive.<br />\nOthers, in turn, may have stopped to listen, and to think. Imagine, people talking, other people listening, and still more thinking. Doesn't that sound like what<br />\ncollege life is supposed to be all<br />\nabout? Shouldn't that be the real<br />\ngoal of a college newspaper, to<br />\nfoster and encourage and occasionally even incite an exchange<br />\nof ideas'?<br />\nToday, all I can hear on the<br />\nHomewood campus is silence,<br />\nand I cannot be part of an<br />\norganization that seeks to foster<br />\nsilence. It is for this, all well as<br />\nfor other reasons, that I am<br />\nhereby officially resigning from<br />\nmy position as Business Manager<br />\nof the News-Letter.<br />\nErica Roth<br />\nThe following letters refer to the<br />\nBlack Student Union's meeting<br />\nthis past Sunday, at which<br />\nrepresentatives of the Hopkins<br />\nSpectator showed a cartoon by<br />\nJames Rosen, our ex-staff carSee LETTERS, 10<br />\n<br />\n\fNEWS-LETTER/9<br />\n<br />\nSpeaker's Corner:<br />\n<br />\nALLIED<br />\nHEALTH<br />\nPROFESSIONALS<br />\n<br />\n2x +1.promotes sexism, not tolerance, at Hopkins<br />\nThis week, in our mailboxes,<br />\nthe Johns Hopkins Women's<br />\nCenter asks us if we are prepared<br />\nto tolerate a sexist cartoon in a<br />\nUniversity-sponsored political<br />\njournal. Since our tuition money<br />\nhelps support the \"Spectator,\"<br />\nand since our university sponsors<br />\nit, we should have a say in what<br />\ntypes of material are inappropriate and offensive. The<br />\nWomen's Center would like the<br />\nadministration to make it clear to<br />\nthe \"Spectator\" (and other<br />\nuniversity-supported publications) that sexism (and racism,<br />\nanti-Semitism, homophobia, etc.)<br />\nwill not be tolerated within their<br />\npages. linot, the administration<br />\nat least tacitly supports such incidents of prejudice.<br />\nMr.<br />\nwhile<br />\nHowever,<br />\nPodurgiel's cartoon is as offensive as it is childish, it must not<br />\nbe viewed as an isolated incident<br />\nthat might be shrugged off as an<br />\naberration. The \"2x +1\" cartoon<br />\nis not the first published prejudice<br />\nat Hopkins, and unless we can<br />\ncreate a fundamental change in<br />\nour campus atmosphere it will<br />\nhardly be the last.<br />\nLet me begin with some<br />\nhistory. During my first year at<br />\nHopkins. I heard occasional<br />\nrumors about a legendary TEP<br />\nfraternity newsletter. Reports<br />\nvaried\u2014it was sexist, it wasn't<br />\nreally that bad, it was funny, it<br />\nwas awful. and, most commonly, it wouldn't have come to<br />\nanything if it hadn't been found<br />\nby a man-hating radical feminist<br />\nwho just wanted to stir things up<br />\nand happened to share a Gilman<br />\nbox with a TEP brother.<br />\nWhen I agreed to write this<br />\neditorial, I was told that the<br />\nWomen's Center had some copies<br />\nof the newsletter, so I decided to<br />\nread it to find out once and for<br />\nall. No two ways about it, it's<br />\nrepulsive. It depicts the brutal<br />\ndouble-rape of a woman and her<br />\nmother. complete with threats,<br />\nforce, and violence. The narrator<br />\nasks, \"don't you know anything<br />\nabout love you rotten slut?\" and<br />\ncalls his younger victim \"you<br />\nfilthy whore.\" The mother is<br />\ncalled \"you rotten old stank<br />\nbox.\" The narrator calls the rape<br />\na \"romantic encounter,\" and<br />\nclaims he left his date and her<br />\n<br />\nmother \"in rapture.\"<br />\nNor does the newsletter stop<br />\nthere. It also notes that Reagan<br />\nand Mondale both have \"a BUSH<br />\nfor a running mate.\" Reference<br />\nis also made to \"Marty's bitch,\"<br />\nand (in a brother-identification<br />\nquiz) to the adjective \"bitchless.\"<br />\nNor has the Hopkins NewsLetter been exempt from prejudice under the guise of humor.<br />\nIn last year's April Fools jokeissue of the \"News-Litter,\" some<br />\nCampus Nots were sexist, racist,<br />\nand homophobic. One referred to<br />\nthe Chinese Students Association<br />\nas \"Little. Yellow. Different.\"<br />\nAnother referred to a group that<br />\nwould kidnap a good-looking IR<br />\nmajor and clone her, turning the<br />\nclone over to a Hopkins male.<br />\nThis was to solve the \"problem\"<br />\nthat Hopkins \"girls\" don't look<br />\nlike girls. Finally, another \"Not\"<br />\nimplied that someone who was<br />\ngay or lesbian didn't know<br />\nwhether they were a man or a<br />\nwoman. And the year before that,<br />\nwe had the infamous \"Gouchercondom\" strip of \"With Eyes<br />\nClosed.\"<br />\nPrejudice is not limited to<br />\nHopkins publications. Rather, it<br />\npervades our entire campus.<br />\nAlthough at least 10 percent of<br />\nHopkins students are homosexual, Gay and Lesbian Alliance<br />\nposters are constantly torn down,<br />\ngenerally within a day of being<br />\nput up. Homophobia is so bad on<br />\nthis campus that GALA officers<br />\npublically<br />\nhave<br />\nbecome<br />\nanonymous to avoid harassment.<br />\nIn lists distributed to all students,<br />\nlisting the various SAC groups<br />\nand their officers. GALA gives<br />\nonly a number which interested<br />\nstudents can call. (Perhaps this is<br />\na good time to introduce myself<br />\nas GALA's newest vicepresident.)<br />\nFurthermore, while some incidents can be chalked up to ignorance, or general hostility,<br />\nsome are so premeditated as to be<br />\nnothing less than deliberate social<br />\nviolence. One example is the<br />\nposter for the fictitious \"Goucher<br />\nGet Laid Party\" which was placed on the door of the Women's<br />\nCenter. Since last year's Center<br />\nwas hidden in the basement of<br />\nAMR II, this took a bit of effort.<br />\nThe \"Spectator's\" \"2x + 1\" car-<br />\n<br />\ntoon is the most recent example.<br />\nAt the end of his cartoon, Mr.<br />\nPodurgiel requests hate mail.<br />\nThus, he knew that his cartoon<br />\nwould upset a large portion of the<br />\nHopkins community\u2014indeed, he<br />\nplanned it. Well, Mr. Podurgiel,<br />\nthis isn't hate mail. What I feel<br />\nfor you is merely pity.<br />\nMartin Luther King, Jr. said<br />\nthat his generation would have to<br />\naccount not only for the terrible<br />\ndeeds of the evil few, but also for<br />\nthe appalling passivity of the good<br />\nmajority. The same is perhaps<br />\neven more true for our own<br />\ngeneration. In every party I've<br />\ngone to since I came to Hopkins<br />\nI've heard sexist and homophobic<br />\ncomments, and I suspect you<br />\nhave too. Every time you see or<br />\nhear prejudice and do nothing you<br />\ngive your tacit approval, just as<br />\nthe university will if it tolerates<br />\nthe \"Spectator\"'s cartoon. Every<br />\ntime you tell a racist, sexist, or<br />\n<br />\nhomophobic joke, you add to the<br />\nlevel of intolerance. In effect, you<br />\nsay you are proud to live in a<br />\ncommunity in which gays must be<br />\ncloseted, in which women and<br />\nminorities are anonymous, and<br />\nwhere prejudice is embraced as<br />\na friend.<br />\nThe problem here at Hopkins<br />\nis indeed large, but it can be solved if we all actively examine and<br />\nreform our beliefs, attitudes, and<br />\nbehavior. We all have prejudices<br />\nbuilt up in us\u2014fight yours, and<br />\nwhen others exercise theirs make<br />\nit clear you don't approve. Go to<br />\nmeetings of the Women's Center,<br />\nGALA, the BSU, the JSA, and<br />\nlearn that there's precious little<br />\nthere to hate or fear.

Despite<br />\nthe author's intentions, the comic strip's racist statements would<br />\noffend many people. If the strip<br />\ncould make people think about<br />\nthe problems of racism and race<br />\nrelations at Hopkins, it would do<br />\nso at the expense of insulting<br />\nmany people of that very same<br />\ncommunity. Instead of bringing<br />\npeople together, this comic strip<br />\nwould easily lead to antagonisms<br />\nthat would exacerbate rather than<br />\nalleviate racial tensions.<br />\nRacism and race relations are<br />\nvery important and sensitive<br />\nissues that affect everyone. The<br />\n<br />\nCarlos Pezua<br />\n<br />\nRosen IV<br />\nTo the Editors:<br />\nI applaud the News-Letter<br />\neditors for refusing to publish<br />\nJames Rosen's cartoon of<br />\n/<br />\n2 years, he<br />\nDecember 8. Over 31<br />\nhas used the power of his<br />\nmedium, the appeal of cartoons,<br />\nto vent any of his personal aggressions with very little accountability to the community. Unlike<br />\nother members of the News-Letter<br />\nstaff, Rosen has never been subject to editing. That Rosen never<br />\nhad any problems with any<br />\nprevious editors only shows the<br />\npoor judgement and cowardice of<br />\nEngler's<br />\nBrown<br />\nand<br />\npredecessors.<br />\nHaving been personally subjected to one of his attacks, I<br />\nrealized that there is no effective<br />\nresponse to Rosen's attacks.<br />\nMore people read the cartoon<br />\nthan the \"Letters to the Editor\"<br />\nand the image of those who complained was that of the petty<br />\nhypochondriac who was unable to<br />\nlaugh at her/himself. In addition,<br />\nRosen always had the last word<br />\nwith an additional mocking inwlt<br />\nor some insipid theory on tbe<br />\nnature of comedy.<br />\nThe idea borders on Fascism<br />\nthat Rosen should be allowed to<br />\nprint any kind of racist diatribe<br />\nsimply because the majority likes<br />\nit. Many people will say, as<br />\nRosen did, that the community<br />\nhas the right to judge for itself the<br />\nmerits of the comic. I saw the<br />\ncontroversial cartoon when the<br />\n\"Spectator\" editors showed it to<br />\n<br />\nSOT I THOUGHT /<br />\n<br />\nYOU KNOw....Some-TIMEE<br />\nYOU REALLY ANIF#26\"<br />\n<br />\nAT RN EXTENDED<br />\nCUIvINIERciRL,<br />\n<br />\nME\". ..<br />\n<br />\nWAS LOOKING<br />\na INFINITI\u201d<br />\n<br />\n1001111g<br />\n<br />\n1411111.4,<br />\n<br />\n41111.,<br />\n<br />\n\u201e,<br />\ney\u201e<br />\n'f co<br />\nc n<br />\n.,,.....<br />\n<br />\n4<br />\n<br />\nII<br />\n<br />\n/Kbtli;<br />\n<br />\nAli<br />\n<br />\nthe Black Student Union and<br />\nbelieve it would serve only to increase the level of racial alienation on campus. The cartoon is<br />\ninteresting in the sense that it<br />\nshows how a white male elitist<br />\nthinks. Yet, you do us no service.<br />\nJames, for leading us white males<br />\nto conclude that blacks are lazy,<br />\napathetic peons whose problems<br />\nare being rationalized by the<br />\n\"liberals.\" These are crucial<br />\nissues concerning race relations<br />\nin this society. Rosen's cartoon<br />\nwas not a constructive step.<br />\nGeorge Lerner<br />\n<br />\nRosen V<br />\nTo the Editors:<br />\nI was appalled after reading the<br />\n\"satirical\" cartoon created by<br />\nJames Rosen regarding the<br />\nworkers of the snack bar, which<br />\nwas shown to the Black Student<br />\nUnion this week. Not only is it<br />\nnot funny, but racism screams<br />\n<br />\nand grates at the very nerve of<br />\neven the half-hearted socially<br />\naware individual.

About fourty-five remained in<br />\nthe audience.<br />\nBut since the film can leave a<br />\nviewer confused, frustrated and<br />\nexhausted, as in the previous<br />\nshowing, a panel discussion<br />\nfollowed to explore some of the<br />\nissues which it addressed.<br />\nWhereas the discussion at the first<br />\nshowing in November had focused on broad issues of societal<br />\nracism and its causes and solutions, the discussion at the second<br />\nshowing focused on what can be<br />\n<br />\nty.\"<br />\nBut she began the dialogue by<br />\nchallenging viewers to stare<br />\nstraight into the truth portrayed<br />\nin the film.<br />\n\"These circumstances are not<br />\nfiction,\" she said. \"Hate, pain<br />\nand intolerance are played out<br />\nevery day.\"<br />\nAnd although the audience<br />\ncould not begin to cover the<br />\nissues at hand, she said, recommendations made that evening<br />\nwould be given to Dean Boswell<br />\nfor consideration.<br />\nThe problem of racism is a<br />\ncomplex one, with many causes<br />\nDr. Ashby began the and outlets, some subtle and some \u2022<br />\nobvious.

To this end both Hopp; Hour and a coffeehouse were<br />\nscheduled in the freshman dorms,<br />\nand the program concluded with<br />\nRay Boston's alcohol-free beach<br />\nparty in the Glass Pavilion.<br />\nHoppy Hour's organizers were<br />\nprepared for a huge turnout. In<br />\nthe social lounge to the left of the<br />\nlobby in AMR I was a spread of<br />\nchips, vegetables, dip, and<br />\ncrackers, the food that most people would say constitutes a good<br />\nHoppy Hour in the Glass<br />\nPavilion. But in the social lounge<br />\nto the right, heated-serving trays<br />\nwith chicken fingers and potato<br />\nskins were set up on a long table,<br />\nalong the back of the room was<br />\nthe usual \"bar,\" and a band<br />\nplayed in a corner.<br />\nAccording to Andrea Perry,<br />\nDirector of Residential Life,\"we<br />\n<br />\nwanted to have it [Hoppy HoUrl<br />\non freshman turf, someplace that<br />\nwas less intimidating. And we<br />\nknew we wanted to have a place<br />\nfor conversation and music.<br />\nHolding Hoppy Hour in the<br />\nfreshman dorms did attract a<br />\nnumber of students who had<br />\nnever been to the social before.<br />\nFreshman Kyle Gliatto is one of<br />\nthe newcomers.<br />\n\"Actually, I wasn't planning<br />\non coming. I saw something was<br />\nup and I just wandered in,\" said<br />\nKyle. \"I'll have to come back<br />\nsome time. It's really good.\"<br />\nAccording to freshman Richard<br />\nSchwartz, many of his classmates<br />\nwere under the impression that<br />\nHoppy Hour cost money, or that<br />\nthey would get carded there.<br />\n\"Having it here might attract<br />\nmore students, but I like the Glass<br />\nPavilion better. At the Glass<br />\nPavilion it was great with the<br />\nbands,\" said Richard.<br />\nAlthough there were a number<br />\nof freshmen in attendance at<br />\nvarious times, they were always<br />\n<br />\nfar outnumbered by the up,<br />\nperclassmen who showed up.<br />\nThis could partly be attributed to<br />\nthe special dinner in the Terrace<br />\nRoom, partly to the lack of<br />\nknowledge about Hoppy Hour.<br />\nSo why did so many upperclassmen make the trek to the<br />\ndorms? The food was not advertised in the Hopkins Halftime<br />\nflyer, so there must have been<br />\nsome other reason.<br />\n\"I never think of Hoppy !-lour<br />\nas a freshman activity,'' said<br />\nsenior Harvey Silkowitz. \"But Iwas surprised that there were so<br />\nfew freshmen at Hoppy Hour la<br />\nsemester.\"<br />\nThe best measure of success is<br />\nnot the volume of people,<br />\nhowever.

This past semester the HOP went through a period of transition in which we were no longer just throwing out events to you, which you didn't want in the first place. We had a committed team of students who<br />\nwere finding out what you wanted to see take place at Hopkins and then we did just that. With a firm commitment for a better quality of programming at Hopkins, the HOP Exec Board gave you numerous events last<br />\nsemester, under its subcommittees, either as a sponsor or co-sponsor as listed below:<br />\nSocial Committee:<br />\n\u2014Hoppy Hours of which some of our cosponsors were the Alumni Association,<br />\nBahamas Tourism, Cultural Festival, Class of<br />\n1991, Electrical Engineering, and Residential<br />\nLife<br />\n\u2014OctoberFest on Gilman Quad<br />\nFine Arts Committee\u2014Trips:<br />\n\u2014Baltimore Symphony Orchestra<br />\n\u2014Driving Miss Daisy\u2014Mechanic Theater<br />\n\u2014Tour of Homewood House<br />\n\u2014Bertha's Mussels for Dinner and Jazz<br />\n<br />\nMiscellaneous:<br />\n\u2014Ray Boston Beach Party<br />\n\u2014Comedy Night<br />\n\u2014The Riot Act<br />\n\u2014Monday Night Football at the Rat<br />\n\u2014Carnival Extravaganza<br />\n\u2014Blizzard of Bucks<br />\n\u2014Karen Goldberg Coffeehouse<br />\nICPB:<br />\n\u2014P.T.

The Beach Party, which we co-sponsored with Orientation '89, two weeks ago, was a great party that everyone enjoyed. These events can continue to happen, but<br />\nwe need your help. Our new office is centrally located at the Student Activities Lounge in Levering Hall. Come<br />\non by and join one of our committees, or come to a HOP Exec Meeting and give us some input.

There were no good protests like those<br />\nspawned by \"The Last Temptation of Christ\" in<br />\n1988 and, overall, fewer shootings at Eddie Murphy films\u2014at least in the audience. On screen it<br />\nwas mayhem as usual, and millions of Americans<br />\ntrooped off to their local movieplexes to see the<br />\nlatest and greatest in cinematic fodder.<br />\nYet for all of the obligatory half-baked ideas,<br />\nsuperstar mismatches, and just plain crummy<br />\nfilms, the year brought some memorable performances and moving moments: Michelle Pfeiffer<br />\nmolding her curves to the piano in \"The Fabulous<br />\nBaker Boys\" and Jessica Tandy taking tiny bites<br />\nof pumpkin pie from Morgan Freeman in \"Driving Miss Daisy,\" for example. There was the<br />\npainfully graphic, as well, like Mel Gibson<br />\ndislocating his shoulder underwater in \"Lethal<br />\nWeapon 2\" and Tom Cruise squirming in his own<br />\nexcrement in \"Born on the Fourth of July.\"<br />\nTop Ten lists are commonplace among critics<br />\nof all kinds. But how many critics can say that<br />\ntheir Top Ten of 1989 will first be published in<br />\nFebruary? I'm a step ahead of the Oscar nominations (I can only vote for technical awards) but<br />\nway behind almost everyone else. I offer a special<br />\nmerit award to \"Roger and Me\" for compiling<br />\nthe longest list of Top Ten citations in memory.<br />\nMy balloting officially ended last Saturday, and<br />\nafter some furious lobbying by Tom Hanks for<br />\nhis role in \"Turner and Hooch,\" I've made my<br />\ndecisions. Unfortunately, I was forced to disqualify \"In Country\" because my objectivity was<br />\nsomewhat skewed by an experience at the screen-<br />\n<br />\ning: A member of the audience approached me afterwards and asked if I had been<br />\nin the film.<br />\n<br />\nFollowing are Mark Friedman's Top Ten Films<br />\nof 1989:<br />\n1 .\"Glory\" An improbable piece of history is<br />\nbronzed for posterity by Edward Zwick (coexecutive producer of \"thirtysomething\") and a<br />\n<br />\nDanny DeVito and Kathleen Turner in \"The War of the Roses\"; below, the sea princess Ariel and<br />\nher best friend, Flounder, in \"The Little Mermaid\"<br />\n<br />\nstellar cast, led by Denzel Washington and<br />\nMorgan Freeman. Triumphant, haunting, and profoundly affecting, the actors in \"Glory\" give the<br />\nstory of the 54th Massachusetts regiment (the first<br />\nall-black volunteer unit in U.S. History) an urgency that drives the film and leaves a monument to<br />\n<br />\na group of men who were martyrs for more than<br />\none important cause. The best of the best.<br />\n2.\"Crimes and Misdemeanors\" Woody<br />\nAllen's nineteenth film in many ways is his richest<br />\nand most satisfyingly complex. Glowingly filmed, \"Crimes and Misdemeanors\" deftly intertwines stories of major and minor moral transgressions. The themes of lust and redemption lock<br />\nneatly into the end of the 1980s, a decade Allen<br />\nclearly identifies with our inability (or lack of<br />\ndesire) to see how bad we really are.<br />\n3.\"Do the Right Thing\" Spike Lee builds a<br />\nneighborhood and an unforgettable line-up from<br />\na blistering summer's day, the belligerent thump<br />\nof Public Enemy, and pent-up doses of<br />\nunacknowledged hostility. Lee's imagery and<br />\nideas challenge moviegoers (and the status quo)<br />\nwith a boldness unique among popular filmmakers<br />\ntoday.<br />\n4.\"Driving Miss Daisy\" Jessica Tandy and<br />\nMorgan Freeman give the best leading performances of the year in this tender story of a twentyfive year relationship between an incorrigible<br />\nJewish widow and her black chauffeur in the<br />\nSouth. There's enough sass on both sides to keep<br />\nthe schmaltz potential at bay, and the ending is<br />\ngenuinely poignant.<br />\n5.\"Batman\" A film that merits repeated, unSee MOVIES, 19<br />\n<br />\nWELL NESS<br />\nAre you interested in<br />\nbeing a community assistant<br />\nfor University-owned<br />\napartment housing?<br />\nThen come to the...<br />\nCOMMUNITY ASSISTANT<br />\n\u2022 INI1EREST/INFORMATION<br />\nSESSION<br />\n(applications will be available)<br />\nMcCoy Social Lounge<br />\nThursday, 8 February 1990<br />\n9:00 - 10:00 am<br />\n3:30 - 4:30 pm<br />\n<br />\nLEARN AT LUNCH<br />\nBROWN BAG LUNCHES<br />\nfor<br />\nSTUDENTS<br />\nTuesday, February 6<br />\n12:00 - 12:45 p.m.<br />\nThe Great Hall - Levering Hall<br />\n<br />\n9,2 yoLATh'ini<br />\n( tIvatt,; a8,00A 'cleat<br />\nor wh4?

Each<br />\nof the four critics was asked to submit a list of<br />\nten favorite albums and ten favorite songs, with<br />\nthe stipulation that none of the songs could be from<br />\nany of the listed albums. The result is predictably<br />\neccentric\u2014removed from the Top 40 mainstream<br />\nin most cases, but not especially radical.<br />\nSeveral of the critics complained that they<br />\ncouldn't produce a list of the ten \"best\" records,<br />\noffering instead eight, eleven, or a group of ten<br />\nthat included a reissue or a record released late<br />\nin 1988. These deviant choices have been preserved. More complaints came about choosing<br />\nsongs\u2014\"there are just too many, man\"\u2014and<br />\nthose selections are admittedly more arbitrary than<br />\nthe album choices.<br />\nIn keeping with the democratic spirit of the<br />\nenterprise, the lists were compiled in a random<br />\norder, with songs (in quotes) and albums (italics)<br />\nmixed together. Each critic contributed at least one<br />\ndescription of a favorite release; these are interspersed throughout the list. Titles that appeared<br />\non more than one list appear below only once.<br />\nThere were several records for which the NewsLetter could not find enough information to print;<br />\nthese were omitted from the final list.<br />\nIn the end, there are no \"No. 1\" or \"No. 2\"<br />\nrecords here.

But with the exception<br />\nof that single, Cherry's debut was received with<br />\ncommercial indifference. No one seemed to know<br />\nexactly what she was about. The record's second<br />\nsingle, \"Kisses On The Wind,\" got nowhere near<br />\nthe Top 20. If it wasn't Cherry's choice of<br />\ntopics\u2014teenage sex, motherhood, responsibility,<br />\nblack market babies\u2014that put people off, it may<br />\nhave been her frank and funny rap style. But hey,<br />\ndidn't anybody notice that \"Buffalo Stance\" was<br />\nabout a pimp who tries to get a young girl to work<br />\nfor him?<br />\n\u2014Mark W.

Yet for all this confusion, \"Tokyo Rose\"<br />\nis rife with subtleties. Parks' subject is the evolving relationship between the U.S. and Japan since<br />\nthe Second World War, and the music on \"Tokyo<br />\nRose\" aptly reflects the various cultural and<br />\neconomic tugs-of-war that both nations have<br />\nshared.

These albums were<br />\nmade the old-fashioned way\u2014by taking a few<br />\ndays' worth of acid into the studio and not coming out until the record was complete. Totally influential and totally inspired. If you don't believe<br />\nme, check out the opening lines to \"Funkadelic\":<br />\n\"If you will suck my soul, I will lick your funky<br />\nemotions.\" It hasn't been said better since.<br />\n\u2014Terry Swords<br />\nTears for Fears\u2014\"Sowing the Seeds of Love\"<br />\n(Polygram)<br />\n10.000 Maniacs\u2014\"Trouble Me\" (Elektra)<br />\nThey Might Be Giants\u2014Lincoln (Bar None)<br />\nThe Smithereens,\u2014\"A Girl Like You\"(Enigma)<br />\nIvo Papasov and his Bulgarian Wedding<br />\nBand\u2014Orpheus Ascending (Hannibal)<br />\nIvo Papasov and his Bulgarian Wedding Band<br />\nare the de facto leaders of the popular \"Wedding<br />\nBand\" (or \"Stambolovo\") movement in their<br />\nhome country. It's an underground movement in<br />\na wa\u2018 the government disapproves, but hasn't<br />\noutlawed the music\u2014and has apparently won a<br />\nlarge following, particularly for Papasov's group.<br />\nOn the basis of \"Orpheus Ascending,\" the<br />\ngroup's first album, it's easy to hear why: these<br />\nia77-influenced literally electric expansions on<br />\nBulgarian folk swing with ferocious elegance. This<br />\nisn't traditionalist folk music by any means\u2014it<br />\nwould be understandably anathemic to the custodians of \"official\" Bulgarian culture. To a less<br />\nrigid senibility. however, these songs carry an<br />\nemotional intensity and sense of musical purpose<br />\nthat is as welcome as a cold gust of wind after<br />\na shower\u2014or better, a lightning bolt. The album<br />\nisn't perfect: the liner notes could be more<br />\ninformative\u2014they are mute about the music's<br />\npolitical context\u2014and translations of the lyrics<br />\nwould be helpful.

As Reed remarks in his<br />\nliner notes, \"You can't beat 2 guitars, bass,<br />\ndrum.\" and there is certainly no more suitable format for his gritty, widely imitated style. Overtly<br />\npolitical lyrics, as a rule, tend to lessen a song's<br />\nimpact; here, Reed snarls at injustice and racism<br />\nwithout sounding preachy or idealistic (are you<br />\nlistening.

Reed has never been one to attack problems with finesse\u2014this is a man who<br />\nfulfilled an unaccommodating recording contract<br />\nby releasing a double album of pure feedback<br />\nnoise.

Cities like Minneapolis/Saint Paul and Berkeley<br />\nhave banned it. A lot of people<br />\nare probably wondering what the<br />\nbig deal is all about.

This compound is less<br />\ndamaging because it breaks up<br />\nmore readily in the lower atmosphere before it reaches the<br />\no7one laver.

The<br />\nJays completed their fall semester<br />\nseason at 5-1 in the league, and<br />\n9-3 overall.<br />\nThe Jays and the Hoyas both<br />\nentered the contest unbeaten in<br />\nleague play, and the battle for<br />\nfirst place lived up to its billing<br />\nas it delivered thrills from the<br />\nopening face-off. On the opening<br />\nplay, the Hoya center was at,le to<br />\ndirect the draw to his<br />\ndefenseman, who immediately atiempted to hit the left wing<br />\nstreaking down the boards in an<br />\neffort to get beyond the Hopkins<br />\ndefense. The winger ended up being set up by his teammate as<br />\ndefenseman Paul Schied had the<br />\nwinger lined up perfectly. After<br />\nviolently disposing of the Hoya<br />\nforward, Schied gained possession of the puck and passed it to<br />\nfreshman winger Jason Sprague,<br />\nwho was wide open behind the<br />\nHoya defense.

The action was fast and<br />\nfurious, but due to tremendous<br />\ndefensive play in the first period,<br />\nthe Blue Jays were able to cling<br />\nto a slim 1-0 advantage. Hopkins<br />\ngoaltender Pierre Chevrier stopped ten shots in the period.<br />\nIn the second period of play,<br />\nthe Jays could no longer stave off<br />\nthe Georgetown onslaught.<br />\nPenalties hampered the Blue Jays<br />\nand two powerplay goals gave<br />\nGeorgetown a 2-1 lead. \"You<br />\ncan't afford to play a team like<br />\n<br />\nGeorgetown shorthanded,\" said<br />\ncoach Steve Wirth.

The Jays could not afford<br />\nto play even up, however, since<br />\nthey trailed by a goal. Despite<br />\nsome good opportunities,<br />\nHopkins could not break through<br />\nwith the needed score. With just<br />\nover a minute to play the Jays<br />\nfound themselves playing shorthanded and trailing 2-1. As<br />\nGeorgetown prepared to pursue<br />\ntheir advantage by entering the<br />\nHopkins zone, Chris Crosby<br />\ndecided to take a gamble. Crosby<br />\nrushed the oncoming forward in<br />\norder to force him to pass, but<br />\nbroke off in the direction of the<br />\nnearest Hoya player just as he<br />\nsaw the pass being made. The<br />\nresult was a clean interception<br />\nand a one-on-one break. The<br />\nHoya defenseman forced Crosby<br />\nto the right of the goal, but<br />\nsomehow Crosby managed to get<br />\noff a backhand shot that fooled<br />\nthe Georgetown goalie. The shot<br />\npassed the goalie but hit the post.<br />\nSprague, trailing the play, rushed for the loose puck and got to<br />\nit just as the Georgetown goalie<br />\ndid. The two collided and the<br />\npuck came free. Crosby picked<br />\nup the loose puck and fired it in,<br />\nbut as he did so a Georgetown<br />\n<br />\ndefender dislodged the net from<br />\nits stand. When the goal moves,<br />\nthe puck is whistled dead, and<br />\ntherefore the goal was disallowed. The referee declared that the<br />\nnet had been removed purposely, however, and ruled that a<br />\npenalty shot be taken by Hopkins.<br />\nSprague was chosen for the task,<br />\nand the freshman displayed his<br />\nusual veteran manner as he slipped the puck between the legs of<br />\nthe Georgetown goalie to even the<br />\nscore at 2-2 with 1:05 left to play.<br />\nGeorgetown maintained its<br />\nman advantage, however, and<br />\npressed hard in the Hopkins zone.<br />\nThe two defending forwards for<br />\nthe Blue Jays got caught high at<br />\ncenter ice, and when one was<br />\nbeaten, a four-on-two break for<br />\nGeorgetown resulted. which they<br />\nwere able to convert into a score.<br />\nWith just 35 seconds left to play,<br />\nthe Hoyas took a 3-2 lead that<br />\nthey would hold.<br />\n\"I don't know what we have to<br />\ndo to beat those guys,\" exclaimed senior assistant Vinny Alfi in<br />\nreference to the fact that the Blue<br />\nJays have never beaten the<br />\nHoyas. The return engagement of<br />\nthe Hopkins-Georgetown matchup will be next semester at<br />\nGeorgetown. \"We'll be ready for<br />\nthat one, I can promise you,\"<br />\nsaid Mike Holmes..<br />\nDespite the loss, the stickmen<br />\nwere pleased with the first half of<br />\ntheir season. \"This is by far our<br />\nbest season,\" explained Alfi. \"If<br />\nyou would've told me that after<br />\nlosing the first two lines from last<br />\nyear's club we'd be 9-3, I would<br />\nhave said you were nuts.\" Added Holmes, \"Last year everyone<br />\nlooked to Billy (Marquardt) and<br />\nGibbo (Pat Gibbons) to do<br />\neverything, and when they didn't<br />\nour team folded. Now everyone<br />\nfeels like they have to contribute<br />\nfor us to win, and so we get a<br />\ngreat<br />\nteam<br />\neffort.\"<br />\n<br />\nDespite injuries, bench<br />\nstrength and stars keep<br />\nwomen's b-ball winning<br />\n-<br />\n<br />\nWomen's Basketball<br />\nMAC Southwest Standings<br />\n<br />\nWHoops, from 22<br />\n<br />\n(71-42) and Swarthmore (72-41)<br />\nbefore a tough 69-67 overtime<br />\nroad loss to MAC rival Franklin<br />\nand Marshall. The Jays played<br />\none of their best games of the<br />\nyear, led by Rolapp's 18 points,<br />\nbut it wasn't enough to beat<br />\nF&M, currently the\\ eighthranked team in the nation. It was<br />\nthe Jays' second overtime loss to<br />\nthe Diplomats this season.<br />\nThe Jays came back the following game to stop Widener 59-38.<br />\nKantowski had her finest outing<br />\nof the season, scoring 20 points<br />\nto lead all scorers and pulling<br />\ndown 17 rebounds.<br />\nIn spite of losing starting point<br />\nguard Williams in the Widener<br />\ngame, the Jays still managed to<br />\nbeat Lebanon Valley (62-47) and<br />\nGettysburg, with Rolapp taking<br />\nover at the point. Rolapp also led<br />\nall scorers in both games with 18<br />\nagainst Lebanon Valley and 16<br />\nagainst Gettysburg.<br />\nThe impact of injuries to<br />\nplayers has not affected the Jays<br />\ntoo severely, in part due to good<br />\nconsistent play by the Hopkins<br />\nbench.<br />\nSaid Blank: \"No one has<br />\nallowed it to mentally wear us<br />\ndown. We were only momentarily discouraged by the injuries and<br />\nknew that they were only temporary setbacks. In spite of the<br />\nadversity, we have continued to<br />\nwin and I think it has made us a<br />\nstronger and more seasoned<br />\nteam.

The win against<br />\nLafayette was expected, but the<br />\nHaverford team was a bit of an<br />\nunknown\u2014a possible contender.<br />\nIn the end, the Hopkins swordsmen took down both schools<br />\nwith little trouble. The final<br />\nscores were Hopkins 22,<br />\nLafayette 5, and Hopkins 20,<br />\nHaverford 7.<br />\nThe foil team made a fine<br />\nshowing in both meets, winning<br />\nthe weapon each time. Co-captain<br />\nMichael Greenfield had a 4-1<br />\nrecord for the day, Yen-len Tang<br />\nfenced 3-1, and sophomore Rich<br />\nMillheiser was 4-1. In addition,<br />\nsenior Li-Kuo Kong put in a 2-0<br />\nshowing, and sophomore Matt<br />\nRosin was 2-0. While foil is often<br />\nthe uncertain link in the Hopkins<br />\nfencing chain, the squad seems to<br />\nbe gaining momentum.<br />\nThe epee team turned in a solid<br />\n<br />\nperformance, going 7-2 in both<br />\nmeets. Juniors Tim Train and Andrew Donnalley were undefeated<br />\nat 5-0 and 4-0, respectively.<br />\nTrain is undefeated in dual meets<br />\nthis season. Sophomore Jorge<br />\nGana was 3-2 for the day, fencing well but dropping two close<br />\nbouts to Haverford. Jason Coleman was 2-1 and Darren Miller<br />\nwas 0-1.<br />\nThe sabre team held its end,<br />\neasily defeating Lafayette 8-1 and<br />\nedging out Haverford in a much<br />\nharder-fought match. Leading the<br />\nway was junior Rob \"Frito\"<br />\nMcLay, whose 5-0 record included three of the five victories<br />\nagainst Haverford. Having a<br />\nmore difficult time was senior cocaptain<br />\nAndrew \"A.J.\"<br />\nJablonowski, 3-2 on the day, who<br />\nlost two of three against Haverford. Junior Pete Kim also<br />\nfinished the day 3-2, both losses<br />\ncoming to Haverford. Junior John<br />\nO'Connell finished with a record<br />\nof 1-1, and junior Juan Suros won<br />\nthe only bout he fenced.<br />\nCoach Dick Oles complimented the squad, \"This team<br />\n<br />\nhas matured from a group of unsure novices into a poised,<br />\nhungry, and well-balanced unit<br />\ncapable of winning back the<br />\nMACFA title which we let slip<br />\nthrough our fingers by one touch<br />\nlast year. But we need to take<br />\nthese meets one at a time, and we<br />\ncan expect the two toughest meets<br />\nthis weekend to be with Baruch<br />\nand William and Mary.\"<br />\nTomorrow eight schools will<br />\ngather at Hopkins for a total of<br />\nseventeen meets.

And the parallel question<br />\nof the academic environment: the<br />\nsize of the faculty, the quality of<br />\nthe program, and so on, and I'm<br />\nsure that he wants to address<br />\nthose. He really has no alternative<br />\nbut to do that. . . . I am sure the<br />\nquestion of the quality of the curriculum will be brought to his attention by students, both graduate<br />\nand undergraduate, if not by<br />\nfaculty and deal's.<br />\nN-L: Penn State is a land grant<br />\nnstitution; community and state<br />\n-elations are paramount. Do you<br />\ncorsee any difficulties for Dr.<br />\nRichardson adjusting to the new<br />\nmvironment at Hopkins?<br />\nSM: The direct answer to your<br />\niuesiton is no. . . . First and most<br />\nimportant, there really isn't any<br />\nother place like Johns Hopkins,<br />\nand I do think that there is a<br />\nchallenge in getting to know and<br />\nunderstand and get a feeling for<br />\nHopkins. I think he knows that<br />\nperfectly well, and I think he<br />\ndoesn't need any special advice,<br />\nbut obviously he is going to make<br />\nthe same effort any new president<br />\nwould make to get to know this<br />\nplace and understand it. . . . The<br />\nreason that I say no to your question is because I think the<br />\nexperience he's had as provost at<br />\nPenn State was, I'm sure, very<br />\nuseful. . . . There are aspects of<br />\nthe Penn State experience that<br />\nare, in fact, very relevant. Penn<br />\nState has become a system; it isn't<br />\njust a college. I think they have<br />\nover 20 branches or campuses.<br />\nAnd that will help him with the<br />\ngeographic and administrative<br />\ndecentralization of Johns<br />\nHopkins. Also, in terms of governance, while the regents at Penn<br />\nState are chosen in a different<br />\nway than the trustees are here,<br />\nonce they are there, the relationships with the board tend to be<br />\nlargely the same whether the institution is private or public. The<br />\nmain thing is he has extensive experience in research universities<br />\nand that's essential. . . I think the<br />\ntransition to Hopkins is always an<br />\nadventure for anybody because<br />\nHopkins is a special place.<br /><br />\nN-L: Considering that Hopkins is<br />\na prominent university, located in<br />\na city with one of the nation's<br />\nlargest black populations, how do<br />\nl'ou account for the lack of any<br />\nAfro-American studies at<br />\nHopkins?<br />\nSM: Well, I think you have to<br />\nsort of think about the context in<br />\nwhich Hopkins is located and<br />\noperates. I can't say that<br />\neverything we have done is right,<br />\nbut I think as you ask that question one has to think about the<br />\nrelationship of Hopkins to an institution such as Morgan State<br />\nUniversity, to the other<br />\npredominantly black institutions,<br />\nin the area. . . and also to the<br />\noverall situation in the city and<br />\nregion. My own feeling is that<br />\nHopkins over time can and should<br />\ndo more with Morgan. I am<br />\nreally<br />\npleased that we got this collaborative program in space<br />\nresearch which is shared with<br />\nMorgan, and if we can begin to<br />\nwork that out we can strengthen<br />\nour relationship with Morgan in<br />\nfields such as engineering. . .<br />\nWe've also made an effort to<br />\nincrease minority enrollment,<br />\nparticularly black enrollment, and<br />\nI think we've got to continue that.<br />\nI think you could ask why<br />\nHopkins doesn't have an art<br />\ndepartment, and the reason is that<br />\nthere is the Maryland Institute<br />\nCollege of Art; we don't have a<br />\nmusic department because<br />\nPeabody is there. And I don't<br />\nthink we could do as good a job<br />\nof Afro-American studies department as Morgan can do.<br />\nThe following question comes<br />\nfrom the Women's Center. The<br />\nreport submitted by the Human<br />\nClimate Task Force referred to<br />\nproblems experienced at this<br />\nuniversity by womeei and<br />\nminorities that were unique and<br />\nexceptionally acute. How is the<br />\nadministration addressing the<br />\nhuman climate issue, and why<br />\nhaven't the steps taken reached<br />\nthe level of the students.<br />\nSM: Well, we've taken that<br />\nreport very seriously land] given<br />\nit a lot of attention, but there are<br />\ncertain priorities that we can address as a central administration<br />\nand the biggest focus has been the<br />\nquestion of day care. . . . That's<br />\nan example of where we have immediately given a priority and<br />\nwhere the central administration<br />\nhas a real voice. . . . The question<br />\nof how we reach student levels is<br />\none that at Hopkins really has not<br />\nbeen a province of the central<br />\nadministration, the central administration doesn't have students<br /><br />\nand that's, at Hopkins, a question<br />\nfor the divisions. If a report is<br />\nmade that points to problems at<br />\nHopkins, and that report is supported by and sponsored by the<br />\ncentral administration, then in<br />\norder for it to be effective it has<br />\nto be digested and addressed in<br />\nthe divisions. That's the best and<br />\nonly way this place can really<br />\nwork. And that takes time. . . .<br />\nN-L: You stated last year that you<br />\nwere planning to devote your remaining time to raising money to<br />\nincrease Arts and Sciences 's endowment. What progress has<br />\nbeen made?<br />\nSM: Well, that turns out to be at<br />\nthis point a more embarrasing<br />\nquestion than I would like. In this<br />\nsense, first, if you look at annual<br />\ngiving to Arts and Sciences and<br />\noverall giving, there have really<br />\nbeen wonderful increases. I think<br />\nthe annual giving in Arts and<br />\nSciences ahs gone up 50 percent.<br />\nThose are mostly small gifts, so<br />\nthe dollars are not overwhelming,<br />\nbut the 50 percent increase in any<br />\nyear is a very desirable thing<br />\nbecause usually the problem is<br />\nnot to hold levels of support but<br />\nto increase them. The overall giving to Arts and Sciencetwent up<br />\nlast year something like 20 percent. That's larger dollars and not<br />\npart of the annual giving program<br />\nas such, but that's also a very<br />\nwelcome development.<br />\nThe reason I say that it's a<br />\nlittle embarrassing for me to go<br />\nfurther is because the trustees<br />\nhave decided that they're in effect going to sponsor an effort to<br />\nget some gifts more or less as a<br />\ntribute to me and they asked me<br />\nif they did that, where would I<br />\nlike that money to be directed and<br />\nI have asked them and they've<br />\nagreed that such funds should be<br />\nan endowment for Arts and<br />\nSciences. But, obviously, I'm not<br />\nengaged in raising money as a<br />\ntribute to me; other people are<br />\ndoing that.<br />\nN-L: How do you accountfor the<br />\nrelative decline of the MSE as a<br />\ncompetitive research library at a<br />\nuniversity which characterizes<br />\nitself as one of the nation's<br />\npremier research institutes?<br />\nSM: The problem that you allude<br />\nto is a problem that is not exactly unique to the MSE. What we<br />\nare looking at is that there has<br />\nbeen an explosion for the past 30<br />\nor 40 years in publications in the<br />\nform of journals, and the<br />\nlibrarians call that serials. The<br />\ncost of these journals is rising<br />\nmuch, much faster than the consumer price index, particularly at<br />\na world-class university where so<br /><br />\nmany of the journals are printed<br />\nabroad. The dollar has declined<br />\nby about half in the past five years<br />\nagainst, for example, the German<br />\nmark, the Japanese yen. . . . We<br />\nare paying a fortune for foreign<br />\nserials compared to American<br />\nones<br />\nPlus shelving all that<br />\nstuff is increasingly a problem.

I feel very blessed because instead if having died<br />\nor gotten sick in this job, the prospect is that I will walk out. . .<br />\nstill feeling very vigorous and<br />\nvery good and, as far as I know,<br />\nhealthy. That means that my first<br />\npriority is to make the most of ths<br />\nprivilege of having discretion as<br />\nto what I do. What I would like<br />\nto do is to keep very busy,<br />\nbecause I have no intention of<br />\nretiring in the sense of doing<br />\nnothing or doing less. I think that<br />\nwould drive me crazy; it would<br />\nprobably kill me. But I'm going<br />\nto be doing a variety of things that<br />\nI want to do. A few because I've<br />\nbeen asked to do them, and a few<br />\nthat I really want to do. I do want<br />\nto write a book. I know that I will<br />\nbe doing some consulting and<br />\nthere is one major, not full-time,<br />\nbut one major activity that I probably will be engaged in. . . [but]<br />\nI'm really not free to go into<br />\ndetail. Something that people<br />\nsometimes forget is that I didn't<br />\nstart out in life with the intention<br />\nof becoming a university president. I started out with the intention of becoming a professor and<br />\nI became one, and in some ways<br />\nI was not so bad at that. . . . I<br />\nwould like to plan over a longer<br />\nperiod than next year or even the<br />\nyear after to go back to teaching<br />\neither on a part-time or full-time<br />\nbasis.

All classes of \"Hopkins<br />\nSummer '90\" are day classes, but<br />\nthe School of Continuing Studies<br />\nwill continue to offer its traditional summer evening program.<br />\nCourse offerings run the gamut,<br />\nfrom chemistry and physics to occidental civilization, foreign<br />\nlanguages and psychology.<br />\nMost of the courses being offered are entry-level freshman<br />\nand sophomore courses, many of<br />\nwhich can be used to fulfill<br />\nmedical school requirements. \"<br />\nIn addition to targeting<br />\nHopkins' students, the School of<br />\nContinuing Studies plans to send<br />\n14,000 course catalogs to<br />\nstudents at other universities in<br />\nthe Middle Atlantic region.<br />\nAlso for the fourth year, the<br />\nsummer session will offer a precollege program to high school<br />\nstudents. \"Hopkins has so much<br />\nto offer these young students as<br />\na university.

He added that, although<br />\nissues such as inadequate minority representation on the student<br />\ncouncil remain unresolved, \"the<br />\nadministration has sincerely tried<br />\nto work out the problems.\"<br />\n\"Richardson thinks diversity<br />\n[in the student body] is important,\" said Martin. Under<br />\nRichardson's tenure, Penn State<br />\nincreased financial aid to its<br />\nminority students. The university has also developed close ties<br />\nwith two local black colleges,<br />\nLincoln and Chaney Universities.<br />\nThis involvement allows for<br />\nfaculty exchanges and special<br />\nconsideration for student transfers<br /><br />\nto Penn State.<br />\nMartin was uniformly positive<br />\nabout Richardson, except when<br />\nquestioned about the condition of<br />\nthe Arts and Sciences at Penn<br />\nState.<br />\n\"Four or five years ago a decision was made about the<br />\nengineering program,\" Martin<br />\nsaid. Penn State expanded the<br />\nengineering school at the expense<br />\nof Arts and Sciences, as well as<br />\nthe architecture program, he said.<br />\n\"It's hard to say whether<br />\nRichardson or [Penn State President] Jordan were responsible,\"<br />\nhe said.<br />\nMartin hastened to add.<br />\nhowever, that the Planning and<br />\nBudget Advisory Committee had<br />\ncome to the conclusion this past<br />\nfall that there was \"a great need\"<br />\nfor improvements in the Arts and<br />\nSciences. Richardson supported<br />\nthe committee's conclusion, Martin said.<br />\nPenn State and Johns Hopkins<br />\nhave one significant similarity,<br />\naccording to Martin; both universities are heavily research<br /><br />\nleave JHU<br />\nto<br />\nWJHU<br />\nStation offered to state of Maryland<br />\nWJHU, from 1<br />\nin this region.<br />\nAlso broadcast on the University station were performances<br />\nfrom the Baltimore Symphony<br />\nOrchestra,\u2022 Peabody and other<br />\nlocal groups. WJHU listeners<br />\neven enjoyed Baltimore's only<br />\naccess to such programs as the<br />\nBBC World News.<br />\nRunning these national and international programs cost WJHU<br />\ntoo much money. however.<br />\nFinancial problems were the<br />\nprimary reasons that the radio station may be turned over to the<br />\nstate.<br />\n\"1 think we would not be as<br />\ngood a station if we did not have<br />\nthe national public radio subscription, but [the subscriptions have]<br />\nsomething like doubled in cost<br />\nover the last three or four years,\"<br />\nsaid Muller. \"We got ourselves<br />\noverbudgeted by carrying them.\"<br />\nMuller explained that the needs<br />\nof other Hopkins programs are<br />\n\"higher priorities\" than the radio<br />\nstation.<br />\n\"At this point it would be<br />\nwonderful if we could continue<br />\nWJHU, but when you're looking<br />\nat some of the needs we have in<br />\nthe library, in Arts and Sciences,<br />\nthe whole Peabody problem, we<br />\nreally can't afford to spend that<br />\nmoney,\" President Muller said.<br />\nBecause the University borrowed heavily to purchase state-ofthe-art broadcasting equipment<br />\nfor WJHU, simply closing the<br />\nstation would mean that Hopkins<br />\nwould still be paying over a<br />\nmillion dollars in debt service<br />\nover the next ten years. Rather<br />\nthan close down the station,<br />\nUniversity officials decided that<br />\nit would he better for Hopkins<br />\nand the Baltimore community if<br />\nWJHU were simply turned over<br />\nto the state. That way, while<br />\nHopkins would pay $250,000 annually in debt payments while the<br />\nstate, under a separate accord<br />\nwith the University of Maryland<br />\nat College Park, would actually<br />\nrun the station.<br />\n\"The state, if it took the station over for Maryland Public<br />\nBroadcasting, would not pay<br />\nHopkins one red cent, but they<br />\nwould assume the lease for the<br />\nIWIHU1 property down at 22nd<br />\nand Charles,\" said Muller. \"If<br />\nwe just closed the station, we<br />\nwould have the financial burden<br />\nof the lease, which is annually<br />\nbigger than the debt service on<br />\nthe equipment.\"<br />\nBecause of this, Muller<br />\nbelieves that \"it's a better deal for<br />\nus than closing the station\u2014<br />\nfinancially and spiritually.\"<br />\n\"We wouldn't have to fire<br />\nanybody, a public servic.. we've<br />\nbeen rendering will be taken over<br />\nby somebody else and they',I take<br />\nover the lease because it's then<br />\ntheir operation,\" Muller said.<br />\nMuller stressed, however, that<br />\nHopkins has no further authority<br />\nin the acquisition matter at this<br />\npoint<br />\n\"The question is: will the<br />\nlegislature agree [to the transaction] and will the governor of<br />\nMaryland Public Broadcasting<br /><br />\nfollow through on taking it over?<br />\nIf they don't, then I think we'll<br />\nhave to close the station. That<br />\nwould be sad and would deprive<br />\nthe community of a service\u2014and<br />\nwould cost us somewhat more<br />\nthan if the [state acquisition] happens.\"<br /><br />\noriented. It is also true that many<br />\nstudents at both universities feel<br />\nthat undergraduate education suffers at the expense of the heavy<br />\nresearch drive.<br />\n\"Most undergraduates say that<br />\nresearch gets too much attention.\" said Martin.<br />\n\"There are times when<br />\nresearch is overemphasized,\"<br />\ncontinued Althaus, \"but under<br />\nRichardson, the undergraduates<br />\nwere not completely ignored.\"<br />\nRichardson, she said, \"looks to<br />\nthe undergraduates as much as the<br />\nacademic<br />\nfinancial<br />\nand<br />\nconcerns.\"<br />\nLou Giangiulio, Student Council president and member of the<br />\nPresidential Search Committee at<br />\nHopkins, had this to say about<br />\nRichardson: \"He was the most<br />\ngenuinely interested in student affairs [of all the presidential<br />\napplicants].\"<br />\nGiangiulio also said that<br />\nRichardson had done his<br />\nhomework extremely well in<br />\npreparation for the interviews,<br />\nanswering detailed questions<br />\nabout Peabody and other institutions, and even making specific<br />\nsuggestions. He said that<br />\nRichardson seemed to lack<br />\ncharisma in the first round of<br />\npresidential interviews, but, once<br />\nthe process was underway,<br />\n\"warnied up,\" and displayed real<br />\nenthusiasm and even a sense of<br />\nhumor.<br />\n\"He't not Mr. Dynamism, but<br />\nafter a while he grows on you,\"<br />\nGiangiulio said.<br /><br />\nWSLEeTTE:Ci<br />\nNew president naNEM<br />\nRICHARDSON, from 1<br />\nson will choose successors to<br />\nProvost Lombardi, Vice President for Medicine Richard Ross,<br />\nand Dean of the School of<br />\nHygiene and Public Health<br />\nDonald Henderson.<br />\nAt Richardson's first Hopkins<br />\npress conference, he stated that<br />\nhis top priority in office will be<br />\nthe actual and psychological wellbeing of students and members of<br />\nthe faculty. One of the main<br />\nreasons for his selection as<br />\npresident was apparently his<br />\ndedication to undergraduate<br />\neducation. Richardson, however,<br />\nplaced much of his emphasis on<br />\nthe faculty throughout the press<br />\nconference. He was particularly<br />\nproud of his success at retaining<br />\nPenn State faculty members.<br />\n\"We're going to have to make<br />\nsure that our faculty know that we<br />\ncare a lot that they're at Hopkins<br />\nand we want them to stay.\"<br />\nRichardson hopes to encourage<br />\ncloser working relationships<br />\nbetween - the divisions of the<br />\nuniversity, particularly between<br />\nthe medical school and the<br />\nundergraduate schools of Arts<br />\nand Sciences and Engineering.<br />\nHe cited the overlap between the<br />\nschools in the departments of<br />\nBiophysics and Biomedical<br />\nEngineering and plans to institute<br />\nan interdivisional faculty council<br />\nwith a greater say in university<br /><br />\nmatters than the faculty currently enjoys.<br />\nRichaMson's second priority is<br />\ncommunity relations\u2014a hallmark<br />\nof his years of service at two<br />\npublic universities, Penn State<br />\nand Washington State. Richardson has already met with<br />\nMaryland Governor William<br />\nDonald Schaefer in an effort to<br />\nbuttress Hopkins' relationship<br />\nwith the state.<br />\nHis third concern is fundraising, particularly for the<br />\nfinancially strapped Arts and<br />\nSciences division. Unlike President Muller, he opposes using the<br />\npresident's discretionary fund to<br />\nbridge the gaps in the Arts and<br />\nSciences budget, saying that the<br />\nonly real solution is to raise the<br />\nschool's endowment.<br />\nRichardson shied away from<br />\nthe image of the president as the<br />\nchief fund-raiser and financial officer, emphasizing instead his<br />\nacademic concerns. He would offer no specific comments on the<br />\nUniversity's Five-Year Plan or<br />\non other budgetary matters.<br />\nRichardson says that he needs<br />\nmore time to study issues such as<br />\nthe budget and the future of the<br />\nApplied Physics Laboratory and<br />\nthe Peabody Conservatory before<br />\ncoming out with definite plans.<br />\n\"I'm still speaking as an outsider,\" he said, \"and I won't be<br />\nhere, really, until July 1.\"<br /><br />\nThe Office of News and Information Services released the<br />\nfollowing biographical sketch of<br />\nRichardson:<br />\nDr. Richardson was named Executive Vice President at The<br />\nPennsylvania State University effective July 1, 1984.

Colombo said<br />\nthat the Homewood Garage<br />\nwould probably remain, for the<br />\ntwofold reason that it is needed<br />\nby the community and that the<br />\nfacade of the garage \"has some<br />\nsort of historical value.\"<br />\nBoswell suggested that the<br />\nrenovations were indicative of a<br />\nmore comprehensive stance by<br />\nthe University on the importance<br />\nof non-academics in student life.<br />\n\"It's [the housing renovations] a<br />\nrecognition on the part of the<br />\nUniversity that the students are<br />\npart of our community in more<br />\nways than the academic and need<br />\nto be supported . . . we need to<br />\nmake the same commitment to<br />\nnon-academics as to academics.<br />\nStudents need support on all<br />\nlevels,\" says Boswell.<br />\nThe Grad Club, which is currently in the basement of McCoy,<br />\nwould continue to exist although<br />\nnot in the same location. Boswell<br />\nindicated that the Club would be<br />\ndesigned into McCoy in such a<br />\nway that noise problems would be<br />\nminimized. Under the current arrangement, McCoy residents<br />\nhave expressed concern that the<br />\nClub would be designed into<br />\nMcCoy in such a way that noise<br />\nproblems would be minimized.<br />\nUnder the current arrangement,<br />\nMcCoy residents have expressed<br />\nconcerns over noise levels on<br />\npopular Grad Club evenings such<br />\nas Band Night and Funk Night.<br />\nJeffrey Blitz, a senior<br />\nHousemaster, was pleased with<br />\nthe plans for Wolman, McCoy,<br />\nand beyond.<br />\n\"What's most impressive<br /><br />\nabout the plans is their sincere attempt to improve the climate of<br />\nliving for those currently living<br />\nin post-freshman University<br />\nhousing.

The new layout<br />\nwill have primarily doubles.<br />\n\"I think a lot of people who<br />\nhave had a taste of having their<br />\nown rooms will have trouble with<br />\nit.\" said one resident. She added that current freshmen will probably be more happy with the<br />\nnew dorms for both the security<br />\nand convenience they offer.<br />\nOther students echoed this comment, suggesting that the renovations would \"make the school<br />\neven more popular. . . it'll make<br />\nfor a more campus-like<br />\n-tmosphere.\"<br />\nDorothy Fleming, Assistant<br />\nDirector for Residential Life,<br />\nagreed with the strongly positive<br />\nresponse to the renovation plans,<br />\nbut expressed some concern<br />\nabout the proposed lease arrangements for the Bradford<br />\nApartments.<br />\n\"I really like the plans.

According to<br />\nboth Lee Kaplan and Dean<br />\nBoswell, there will be \"no new<br />\nrules about house rules,\" but the<br />\nrecommendations are included in<br />\nlight of the changed off-campus<br />\nclimate.<br />\nAfter meeting with the University's general counsel, both Dean<br />\nBoswell and Bill Smedick decided to end the practice of supplying a cover letter to fraternities<br />\nseeking a one-day liquor license<br />\nfor off-campus parties. According to Dean Boswell, the new<br />\nadministration at the Baltimore<br />\nCity Liquor Board is interpreting<br />\nthese cover letters as resting a<br />\ncertain amount of responsibility<br />\nwith the University which it was<br />\nnot willing to accept in situations<br />\nwhere the University lacked control. As Bill Smedick explained,<br />\nthe previous Board administration<br />\nhad used the cover letter as \"one<br />\namong several determining factors.\" \"University lawyers felt<br /><br />\nthat there was too much risk in<br />\nan uncontrollable situation,\" he<br />\nadded.<br />\nThe lack of cover letters means<br />\nthat the Liquor Board will not<br />\nissue fraternities one-day liquor<br />\nlicenses, making off-campus parties, at least of the traditional size<br />\nand scope, extremely difficult.<br />\n\"[You] can't have large, unruly<br />\nparties anymore,\" said Bill<br />\nSmedick. Lee Kaplan pointed out<br />\nthat problems of police, the liquor<br />\nboard, carding, and community<br />\nmake off-campus parties a problem at this point.<br />\nAccording to Aaron Stansbury<br />\nof the Baltimore City Liquor<br />\nBoard, the reason the board will<br />\nnot grant liquor licenses, at all,<br />\nto Hopkins fraternities stems<br />\nfrom an agreement that the<br />\nUniversity arranged, seven to<br />\neight years ago, with the previous<br />\nboard administration, requesting<br />\nthat no student organization be<br />\ngiven a liquor license without a<br />\ncover letter. Citing this agreement, Mr. Stansbury explained<br />\nthat fraternities were considered<br />\n\"an arm of the university.\" This<br />\nrestriction, said Mr. Stansbury,<br />\ndoes not extend to the other colleges under the board's jurisdiction. He also made it clear that<br />\nif it was indicated to him that the<br /><br />\nagreement were ended, then<br />\nfraternity requests for liquor<br />\nlicenses might have to go through<br />\npublic hearings, where community complaints with some Greek<br />\norganizations might not help in<br />\nthe process. But the original<br />\nagreement, Mr. Stansbury noted,<br />\nwas the result of \"the change in<br />\nthe law for minors in that period\"<br />\nand was requested as a means of<br />\n\"exercising control.\" He expressed skepticism about the<br />\npolicing system of monitors at<br />\nfraternity parties.<br />\nDean Boswell and Bill Smedick<br />\nboth are recommending oncampus activities. Bill Smedick<br />\nhopes to see \"smaller events in<br />\nthe community and larger events,<br />\nwhere there were community<br />\nrelations problems, on campus.\"<br />\n\"It's not as if we said 'too bad',\"<br />\nstated Dean Boswell. \"We're<br />\nsurrounded by campus here<br />\n[Levering Hair making larger<br />\nparties possible. In her view, the<br />\nmove \"strengthens\" fraternities<br />\nin \"assisting them to control it<br />\nthemselves. The only difference<br />\nis that it's less likely that<br />\nunderage people will be able to<br />\nget alcohol.\"<br />\nLee Kaplan feels that for certain fraternities, it is a positive<br />\nstep since a lot of complaints are<br /><br />\nbased just on noise. \"For others,<br />\nit's gonna' be kinda' tough. People are going to have smaller<br />\nparties.\"<br />\nAs for initial feedback from the<br />\nfraternities, Lee Kaplan said that<br />\n\"a few are disturbed at the initial<br />\nactions. . . people are a little skeptical.\" A one-day conference was<br />\nheld in January \"to develop<br />\nideas,\" according to Bill<br />\nSmedick. People were not only<br />\nresponding but asking \"what we<br />\ncan do\" and looking for ways to<br />\nclean up their acts.<br />\n\"Policies are okay for what<br />\nthey're worth, but there needs to<br />\nbe more education,\" stated Bill<br />\nSmedick, citing an instance of<br />\nalcohol poisoning in a residence<br />\nhall already this semester.<br />\nIn addition, Bill Smedick feels<br />\nthat there is little knowledge of<br />\nfraternity volunteerism. Dean<br />\nBoswell suggested that Greek<br />\norganizations<br />\ndemonstrate<br />\nresponsibility by becoming<br />\nvisibly involved in the<br />\ncommunity.<br />\nLee Kaplan surmises the<br />\noverall situation as a period of<br />\nchange. \"This is [an] area where<br />\nthings are coming off of a period<br />\nof change.\" Conflict, he said, is<br />\ninevitable.<br /><br />\nNew<br />\nH-master<br />\nMcCoy welcomes Evitts<br /><br />\nCollege officials split on alcohol policies<br />\nSeven years alter most states<br />\nincreased the legal drinking age<br />\nto 21, college officials are still<br />\nwrestling with how to respond.<br />\nSome are trying to Qtamp out<br />\nunderage drinking on tneir campuses, while others say a more<br />\nrealistic approach is to<br />\nacknowledge that students use<br />\nalcohol and to encourage them<br />\nnot to abuse it.<br />\nSome administrators argue that<br />\ntelling underage students to drink<br />\n\"responsibly\" encourages them<br />\nto flout the law. Those administrators believe universities<br />\nshould strictly prohibit alcohol<br />\nconsumption by such students.<br />\nOthers say the vast majority of<br />\nstudents would drink anyway.<br />\nWhile they agree that universities<br />\nshould not encourage students to<br />\nbreak the law, they believe institutions have a pressing obligation to persuade students to stop<br />\nshort of abuse.<br /><br />\nmpted some students to wait<br />\nlonger to begin drinking, almost<br />\nall say alcohol remains the most<br />\nwidely used drug among college<br />\nstudents. Violent incidents related<br />\nto its abuse\u2014ranging from date<br />\nrape to death\u2014continue to plague<br />\nmany campuses.<br />\n\"Alcohol is still the No. 1<br />\nsource of discipline problems and<br />\nother emotional or physical problems on campus,\" says Robert<br />\nF. Ariosto, dean of student affairs<br />\nat Central Connecticut State<br />\nUniversity. \"That's a fact that<br />\ndoesn't go away.\"<br />\nSome students say that raising<br />\nthe drinking age has not reduced<br />\ndrinking problems among young<br />\npeople. Instead, they say, it has<br />\nencouraged underages students<br />\nboth to go off campus to drink<br />\nand to use alcohol in larger<br />\namoutst when they do get hold of<br />\nit. Students on several campuses<br />\nof the University of Wisconsin<br />\nhave organized campaigns to<br />\npush state legislators to lower the<br />\ndrinking age, and students at<br />\nother institutions are considering<br />\nsimilar drives.<br /><br />\nState Laws Pose Problems<br /><br />\nCounselors at Rochester<br /><br />\nRegardless of which side<br />\nthey're on, almost all administrators agree that state laws<br />\nraising the drinking age to 21<br />\nhave made it difficult to set campuswide policies, since some<br />\nundergraduates can drink legally and others cannot.<br />\nWhile a few administrators say<br />\nthey believe the laws have pro-<br /><br />\nDennis O'Brien, president of<br />\nthe University of Rochester, is<br />\namong those who favor teaching<br />\nstudents to drink responsibly,<br />\nregardless of their age. Mr.<br />\nO'Brien says that does not mean<br />\nhe ignores the law\u2014indeed, he<br />\ntells underage students they risk<br />\narrest if they are caught drinking<br />\nalcoholic beverages. But because<br /><br />\nCopyright 1990<br />\nChronicle of Higher Education.<br />\nReprinted with permission.<br /><br />\nby Courtney Leatherman<br /><br />\nmost of Rochester's students<br />\ndrink anyway, Mr. O'Brien and<br />\nother officials encourage students<br />\nto stop before they get drunk.<br />\nAt Rochester, couselors meet<br />\nwith students in dormitories<br />\nseveral times a year to tell them<br />\nabout the problems that can result<br />\nform alcohol abuse\u2014including<br />\npoor academic performance and<br />\nviolence.<br />\nMr. O'Brien says that<br />\npreaching abstinence is ineffective. Alcohol education, he<br />\nbelieves, should be similar to the<br />\nsex education that many campus<br />\nhealth centers offer.<br />\n\"I hope we're not condoning<br />\ninappropriate sexuality,\" he says.<br />\n\"But the fact is, [students] do<br />\nengage in it and ought to know<br />\nwhat the risks are and how to<br />\nbehave so they don't get AIDS.\"<br />\nRoss J. Rapaport, coordinator<br />\nof the alcohol and drug-abuse intervention and prevention program at Central Michigan<br />\nUniversity, says adminstrators<br />\nshould tell students what the law<br />\nsays and explain to them the consequences of breaking it. But he<br />\nadds: \"We can't put our heads in<br />\nthe sand.\"<br />\nMr. Rapaport estimates that<br />\nbetween 80 and 90 per cent of the<br />\nstudents at Central Michigan<br />\ndrink, despite the university's<br />\nstrict policies to combat alcohol<br />\nuse by underage students. \"It's<br />\nirresponsible not to deal with that<br />\nreality from a health-education<br />\nstandpoint,\" he says, \"But you<br />\nwalk a tightrope.\"<br />\nCleve B.

He says the<br />\ndesignated-driver programs that<br />\nsome colleges have started have<br />\nreduced alcohol-related accidents.<br />\n\"In the past four years, I've<br />\nseen a total change in students' attitudes about drinking and driving,\" he says, \"It's taboo.\"<br />\nSome college administrators<br />\nbelieve that campaigns against<br />\ndrinking by underage students<br />\nshould be given a top priority.<br />\nJennifer Berkman, director of<br />\nSalisbury State University's<br />\nalcohol and drug prevention<br />\nresource center, tells underage<br />\nstudents why it's dangerous to<br />\ndirink too much. But she also<br />\nsays colleges should emphasize<br />\nthat drug use and underage drinking are illegal. Doing so, she<br />\nsays, helps students understand<br />\nthat they must abide by laws\u2014<br />\nwhether or not they agree with<br />\nthem.<br />\n\"I tell seniors that when they<br />\ngraduate next year, they won't be<br />\nable to take drugs because there<br />\nwill be drug testing,\" she says.<br />\n\"We're making connections between the rules on campus and<br />\nthose in the real world.\"<br />\nJoseph W. Dorton, chief of enforcement for the South Carolina<br />\nAlcoholic Beverage Control<br />\nCommission, agrees with Ms.<br />\nBerkman. \"If universities and<br />\ncolleges want to teach responsibiltiy, there might be something<br />\nto be said for teaching observation of the law\u2014simply because<br />\nit is the law,\" he says. Mr. Dorton is investigating the death of<br />\nan underage Clemson University student who was drunk when<br />\nshe fell from the third floor of a<br />\nfraternity.<br /><br />\nby Fariah khan<br />\nHousemaster's<br />\nAnother<br />\nresignation has been turned in to<br />\nthe Office of Residential Life.<br />\nJunior Michael Evitts replaced<br />\nMatthew O'Brien as Housemaster<br />\nin McCoy at the beginning of this<br />\nsemester.<br />\nEvitts is a Writing Seminars<br />\nmajor, originally from Roanoke,<br />\nVirginia. He said that he did not<br />\ninitially apply for the position of<br />\nHousemaster because he had been<br />\nplanning to spend his junior year<br />\nin Europe. However, he ended up<br />\nstaying at Hopkins, and when<br />\nthere was an opening for the position for Building B, he submitted<br />\nan application to the Office of<br />\nResidential Life. That opening<br />\nwas filled by Tom Brennan in October. A second opportunity arose<br />\nwhen<br />\nMatthew O'Brien resigned the<br />\nweek before Christmas.<br />\nWhen asked why he wanted to<br />\nbe a Housemaster, Evitts said, \"I<br />\nhad a good time freshman year.<br />\nI guess that in the hack of my<br />\nmind, I just wanted to transmit<br />\nthat to other people.\"<br />\nEvitts cited \"getting to know<br />\npeople\" as the most satisfying<br />\naspect of the job. \"It's amazing<br />\nthat I actually get paid for taking<br />\nthese people and doing things<br />\nwith them,\" said Evitts.<br />\nBut, being a mid-year replacement does have its share of disadvantages. \"It is quite challenging<br />\nbecause the freshmen are not so<br />\ndependent anymore. They are used to taking care of themselves.\"<br />\nEvitts, however, does not seem<br />\nto be confronted with the problem<br />\nof being accepted by McCoy<br />\nresidents, considering the<br />\nresponse that his introduction was<br />\ngiven at the first dorm meeting of<br />\nthe semester.<br />\nMike has also had support from<br />\nhis colleagues, Andrea Rose and<br />\nJeff Blitz, the other Housemasters<br />\nof McCoy.<br /><br />\nRegardless of which side of the<br />\ndebate they take, almost all college administrators agree that the<br />\nrise in the legal drinking age has<br />\nput them in a no-win situation. It<br />\ncreates an unnatural split in the<br />\nstudent population that makes setting and enforcing campus-wide<br />\nalcohol policies nearly impossible, they say.<br />\n\"It's awfully hard to control a<br />\nmixed-age group where some can<br />\ndrink and some can't, but all are<br />\nstudents,\" says Robin S. Wilson,<br />\npresident of California State<br />\nUniversity at Chico.<br />\nMr.<br />\nAdds Rochester's<br />\nconsumption<br />\nO'Brien: \"Since the<br />\nofulcohol is not in general an illegal activity\u2014unlike marijuana<br />\nor crack\u2014you have this bizarre<br />\nsituation where at the mystic age<br />\nof 21, suddenly people can drink<br />\nlegally when they couldn't the<br />\nday before.\"<br />\nOthers say that because<br />\nAmericans often treat the consumption of alcohol as a rite of<br />\npassage and becasue advertisements give drinking a<br />\nglamorous aura, colleges have a<br />\ntough time enforcing any<br />\npolicy\u2014whether they are pushing<br /><br />\n\"Andrea and Jeff are invaluable.<br />\nThe living situation in McCoy is<br />\nnot comparable to other dorms;<br />\nthere are three Housemasters. It<br />\nis much easier for me because<br />\nthere are two other Housemasters<br />\nholding my hands through this.<br />\nThey are Housemastering me,\"<br />\nsaid Evitts.<br />\nAnd too many cooks are not<br />\nspoiling the broth. \"There is no<br />\nproblem of us stepping on each<br />\nother's toes. It's really a<br />\nmatter of people working with<br />\npeople.\" continued Evitts.<br />\nAbout the residents of McCoy,<br />\nEvitts commented that although<br />\nthe freshmen are quite independent, there is a remarkable sense<br />\nof unity among them. \"It's really surprising because they don't<br />\nshare bathrooms or anything, as<br />\nin the dorms,\" observes Evitts,<br />\nreferring to the apartment-style<br />\nliving arrangements in McCoy.<br />\nSo far, Evitts has collaborated<br />\nwirh Rose and Blitz on one major dorm event, the Superbowl<br />\nparty. With this event already<br />\nunder his belt, Evitts is optimistic<br />\nabout future activities.<br />\nHe believes that these activities<br />\nshould be based on mutual decisions between the freshmen and<br />\nthe Housemasters. \"I would like<br />\nto get some feedback from<br />\nresidents on what they want.\"<br />\nEvitts's future plans for the<br />\nfreshmen include road trips to<br />\nlacrosse games and small group<br />\nexcursions to marketplaces near<br />\nthe Inner Harbor.<br />\nIn general, McCoy residents<br />\nare not antagonistic towards the<br />\nnew situation. McCoy has not<br />\nsuffered from the turmoil that<br />\nplagued Building B after their<br />\nHousemaster's resignation. According to Andrea Rose, Matt<br />\nO'Brien's resignation was totally voluntary. \"He just had too<br />\nmany personal obligations to<br />\nfulfill this semester.\" O'Brien<br />\ncould not be reached for<br />\ncomment.<br /><br />\nfor abstinence or for responsible<br />\ndrinking.<br />\nLong-Term Effects Seen<br />\nProponents of the rise in the<br />\ndrinking age acknowledge that<br />\nthe laws have created some problems on campuses. But they say<br />\nthe change has prompte administrators to make students<br />\nmore aware of the dangers of<br />\nalcohol abuse. And they believe<br />\nthat over the long term the laws<br />\nwill curb drinking among young<br />\npeople. A survey at the University of Minnesota-Twin Cities<br />\nfound that after the drinking age<br />\nwent up, fewer 18-and-19-year<br />\nold students reported that they<br />\ndrank alcoholic beverages.<br />\n\"I think our expectations might<br />\nbe too high,\" says South<br />\nCarolina's Mr. Dorton, who<br />\npredicts that problems will<br />\ndiminish the longer the laws are<br />\nin effect. \"I think raising the<br />\ndrinking age was intended to<br />\nshow long-term effects, and<br />\nwe're seeing some of the<br />\npsychology involved in the law<br />\nbeing borne out: Kids'are waiting<br />\nlonger to start drinking.\"<br /><br />\nAPL tests missiles<br />\nby Steven Mizrach<br /><br />\nThe Johns Hopkins Applied<br />\nPhysics Laboratory has been involved in extensive testing for the<br />\nTrident II submarine-launched<br />\nmissile system for the Navy. Recent tests have been moderately<br />\nsuccessful, and the Navy has<br />\nstepped up production; however,<br />\nthere were several spectacular<br />\nfailures last summer. APL is<br />\nunder contract to evaluate and test<br />\nthe Trident II missile system. According to local peace activist<br />\nMax Obuziewski, \"Every black<br />\nbox containing all the trajectory<br />\ninformation on the Trident submarine is sent back to the APL<br />\nto be studied by the scientists<br />\nthere.\"<br />\nAs of 1987, the APL had three<br />\nseparate Trident contracts with<br />\nthe Navy: Strategic Weapons<br />\nSystem Evaluation, $4.9 million;<br />\nSonar, Command, and Control<br />\nSystem Evaluation, $12.5<br /><br />\nmillion; Trident I Backfit System<br />\nEvaluation, $12.3 million. The<br />\nfirst program's parameters are<br />\ndescribed as covering \"the<br />\nNavy's operational tests and<br />\nevaluation of the Trident II<br />\nsystem, and it addresses all<br />\naspects of system performance<br />\nexcept accuracy, which is<br />\nevaluated in another program,<br />\nand supporting the Navy in this<br />\narea APL generates data requirements, test plans and<br />\nanalyses. Then it assesses performance on the data so acquired.<br />\nAccording to another local<br />\npeace activist, Pat Birnie, \"The<br />\nTrident is clearly a first-strike<br />\nweapon, and its only purpose<br />\nwould be to pre-empt retaliation,<br />\nthat is, to unilaterally destroy the<br />\nenemy. And APL makes sure that<br />\nthe Trident is that much more<br />\nlethal.\" Many experts believe<br />\nthat \"first-strike\" nuclear<br />\nweapons are highly destabilizing,<br />\nespecially now that Soviet<br /><br />\nmilitary response is so<br />\nunpredictable.<br />\nThe Applied Physics Lab is<br />\ncompelled to carry on these tasks.<br />\nAccording to Nuclear Free<br />\nAmerica director Albert Donnay.<br />\n\"The contract with the Navy is<br />\nsuch that if the lab refuses their<br />\nresearch requests they may<br />\nassume control of it\u2014that's their<br />\nguarantee, that they can buy out<br />\nthe lab. The best that Hopkins can<br />\ndo is divest and let the Navy solely find researchers for their programs. But the nuclear weapons<br />\nwork will go on.\" Many opposition groups, including the APL<br />\nConversion Project, have come to<br />\naccept this, but still maintain that<br />\n\"it is not right for one of the nation's leading health care research<br />\ninstitutes to do such terrible<br />\nmilitary projects for the Department of Defense.\"<br /><br />\nBucknell threatens<br /><br />\nSC Minutes<br /><br />\n17<br />\nS<br />\nLETR<br />\nSa<br />\nE r<br />\nNf<br /><br />\nGreek dismantlement threatened<br /><br />\nby Jeff Perlstein<br />\nStudent Council Secretary<br />\nMuch of the discussion at this<br />\nweek's Student Council meeting<br />\nfocused on the work of the.<br />\nHomewood Schools Services Advisory Committee, specificially in<br />\nthe areas of housing and the<br />\nbookstore.

Not true\u2014after near<br />\nmental collapse, he does manage<br />\nUo obtain transportation to the airport It is not until he is trapped<br />\nin the car in the midst of rushhour traffic, however, that his<br />\nscheming friend at the wheel inform,him that he must buy her<br />\na drink upon their arrival at the<br />\nairport.<br />\n(Our story continues as our<br />\nhero, in a near-hypnotic daze,<br />\nfinds himself saying. \"Why, yes,<br />\nof course I'd love to buy you a<br />\ndrink when we get there, why<br />\nnot. I'm sure there'll be plenty of<br />\ntime.)<br />\nThe jerk on the emergency<br />\nbrake in the parking lot was all<br />\nthe running start I needed to propel myself down the deck to my<br />\ngate. I thought I had left my<br />\nfriend far behind, and I felt really awful, but\u2014well, actually. I<br />\ndidn't feel that bad, I sort of<br />\ndidn't care.<br />\nAnyway, I got to the gate, and<br />\nlanded at the check-in station'.<br />\nThe nices! flight attendant I have<br />\never met in my life pried my<br />\ngrimy, sweat-stained ticket out of<br />\nthe bouquet of muscle contraction<br />\nthat my hand had turned into,<br />\nchecked me in, and gave me my<br />\nseat, saying \"Thank you, please<br />\nhave a seat. We'll be boarding in<br />\njust a few minutes.\"<br />\nI took my ticket back, and turned around slowly, trying to regain<br />\ncontrol of myself.<br />\nMy friend was there. \"You<br />\nowe inc a drink,\" she said.<br />\nMany hundreds of years ago,<br />\nin anticipation of this day, a<br />\ngroup of people, hell-bent on my<br />\ndestruction, got together to do<br />\nfour things.<br />\n1 he first was, they invented<br />\nalcohol. This was so that my<br />\nfriend could ask me for a drink<br />\nin the first place.<br /><br />\nCensorshin and editorshi<br />\nMany people, reading the cartoon on page nine of the<br />\nHopkins Spectator (presumably our campus' counterpart<br />\nto the Dartmouth Review), may have mistakenly assumed that the artist's slam on the alleged shortcomings of<br />\nHopkins' female students was simply another expression<br />\ninsecure male misogyny. Yet to do so would be to<br />\nmisunderstand a subtle effort on the part of the Spectator<br />\nto draw our attention to serious shortcomings within the<br />\nuniversity.<br />\nIn the first panel of the strip, in which the cartoonist<br />\nrefers to Hopkins women as dogs, he is clearly trying to<br />\nconvey, in the verbal shorthand so prevalent here (orgo,<br />\nchem, 'Sems, etc.) that females at this institution are<br />\nUNDERdogs. For this cour-ageous stand he should be<br />\ncommended by all. Not even the administration is willing<br />\nto admit that the climate for women here can be so<br />\nnotoriously uncomfortable as to actually discourage them<br />\nfrom pursuing faculty positions.<br />\nThe complex \"2x + 1\"rule, laid out so cleverly in the<br />\ntwo boxes which follow the first, is self-evidently a twopronged strike at the underrepresentation of women on the<br />\nmath and science faculty, and a critique of the University's misleading policy of OVER-representing women in<br />\nglossy brochures promoting the school to the outside<br />\nworld. The charge that there may be a mathematical formula behind the latter practice is both astonishingly bold<br />\nand frightening in its implications. The last block of the<br />\ncartoon, in which it is noted that \"a little math and imagination goes a long way,\" is a skillful blending of these<br />\ntwo concepts. Not content to allow the strip to stop at this<br />\nalready impressive conclusion, however, the character in<br />\nthis sentence manages to mangle his grammar in a way<br />\nthat would make a fourth-grade teacher cringe, thereby<br />\ncondemning the inadequacies of the American educational<br />\nsystem.<br />\nTo be fair, however, the News-Letter must confess to<br />\nnot having an altogether clean record when it comes to<br />\n,promoting tolerance on campus, despite our aspirations<br /><br />\nto that end. Several times in the recent past, we published<br />\nstaff work which should not have been printed due to its<br />\nintolerant, demeaning characterizations of Hopkins<br />\nstudents. At the time we published them, we accepted an<br />\nargument that not to do so would be tantamount to censoring a point of view with which we did not agree. After<br />\nreflection, we realized that nothing could be further from<br />\nthe truth, and at the end of last term refused to run yet<br />\nanother example of terminal intolerance.<br />\nOur response to a charge of censorship is that all internal productions are subject to the same editorial<br />\nprerogatives that apply to anything else produced by the<br />\nNews-Letter staff. To deny the editorial board the right<br />\nto decide which internal productions are appropriate, and<br />\nwhich are not appropriate, for inclusion in the News-Letter,<br />\nis to make our jobs superfluous. At the same time, we do<br />\nnot edit outside contributions such as letters to the editor,<br />\nor Speaker's Corner contributions, for content. The<br />\ndistinction between editorship, the supervision of the internal policies or production of a publication, and censorship, by which we would refuse to publish anything we<br />\ndidn't like, is an important one. The sheer number of letters to the editor we print each week, often unfavorable<br />\nto us, attests to the fact that we do not presume to censor<br />\nthe Homewood campus, and that people realize this to be<br />\nthe case.<br />\nSexism and racism have no place on our campus, or in<br />\nthe News-Letter. Although we, of course, have no control<br />\nover letters to the editor and the like, nor would we want<br />\nsuch control, the News-Letter reserves the right to edit the<br />\ninternal productions of our own newspaper as we see fit.<br />\nTo do so is not to censor, but to be responsible editors.<br />\nIf we have failed to live up to this responsibility as fully<br />\nas we should have in the past, we apologize. We can only<br />\nhope that other publications will learn from our mistakes<br />\nas we have, and endeavor to make Johns Hopkins the haven<br />\nfrom prejudice, and its stablemate, ignorance, that this<br />\nUniversity should be.<br /><br />\nWelcome Richardson<br />\nThe News-Letter would like to take this opportunity to congratulate William C. Richardson, PhD, on his appointment<br />\nto the presidency of Johns Hopkins University. As of July 1 he will take on the sole responsibilty of heading one<br />\nof the nation's top research institutions. With Hopkins<br />\nlooking ahead to the twenty-first century, the opportunity<br />\nbefore Richardson is not only one of tremendous power<br />\nand prestige, but also one ripe with potential for change.<br />\nRichardson, on paper, appears to be tailor-made for the<br />\ntraditional Hopkins mentality. He comes from a university as vastly diversified as Hopkins; he has a public health<br />\nbackground, and he reveres the importance of research in<br />\neducation.

Richardson's concern for academics and extracurricular issues runs<br />\nthroughout his track record. Even if Richardson's meeting<br />\nwith Hopkins students before his press conference was a<br />\nstaged media spectacle, undergraduate students at Penn<br />\nState have praised both his visibility and his desire to involve students, both graduates and undergraduates, in the<br />\nuniversity's descision making process.<br />\nAlthough Richardson must obviously adhere to the five<br />\nyear plan and other budgetary constraints, he possesses<br />\nan ingrained ideology that emphasizes the academic side<br />\nof university life. Under such leadership the News-Letter<br />\nhopes that Arts and Sciences will regain its position as the<br />\nepicenter of our University's intellectual life.<br /><br />\nLetters<br /><br />\nRosen's cartoons have previously appeared. In fact, in the<br />\nDecember 1 issue (just before<br />\nthey decided not to run the cartoon) the editors wrote a piece entitled \"Speak your mind at the<br />\nNews-Letter.\" The editors expressed their \"aspiration [for the<br />\nNews-Letter] to be a forum for<br />\nthis diverse university.\" In addition, they even set up a new column, a 'speaker's corner,' which<br />\nthey claimed would \"always be<br />\navailable to any group or individual who desires to verbalize<br />\nhis or her feelings on any issue.\"<br />\nThe editors concluded by proclaiming,\"We are, after all, your<br />\nstudent newspaper.\"<br />\nYet, in light of their decision<br />\nnot to run James Rosen's cartoon,<br />\none is forced to conclude that the<br />\neditors are, quite simply,<br />\nhypocrites. How can anyone take<br />\ntheir above claims seriously<br />\nwhen, in the very next issue, they<br />\nrefuse to print views of one of<br />\ntheir very own staff members.<br />\nSurely, James Rosen is an individual who desires to verbalize<br />\nhis feelings, yet he was not permitted by the editors to do so.<br />\nRegardless of the content of<br />\nJames Rosen's cartoon, or<br />\nanyone else's work for that matter, the editors were wrong not<br />\nto publish it. First, because they<br />\nopenly encouraged viewpoints on<br />\nthe editorial page, and second and<br /><br />\nmore importantly, because<br />\nsomething quite wonderful could<br />\nhave happened if they had<br />\npublished it.

During my first year at<br />\nHopkins. I heard occasional<br />\nrumors about a legendary TEP<br />\nfraternity newsletter. Reports<br />\nvaried\u2014it was sexist, it wasn't<br />\nreally that bad, it was funny, it<br />\nwas awful. and, most commonly, it wouldn't have come to<br />\nanything if it hadn't been found<br />\nby a man-hating radical feminist<br />\nwho just wanted to stir things up<br />\nand happened to share a Gilman<br />\nbox with a TEP brother.<br />\nWhen I agreed to write this<br />\neditorial, I was told that the<br />\nWomen's Center had some copies<br />\nof the newsletter, so I decided to<br />\nread it to find out once and for<br />\nall. No two ways about it, it's<br />\nrepulsive. It depicts the brutal<br />\ndouble-rape of a woman and her<br />\nmother. complete with threats,<br />\nforce, and violence. The narrator<br />\nasks, \"don't you know anything<br />\nabout love you rotten slut?\" and<br />\ncalls his younger victim \"you<br />\nfilthy whore.\" The mother is<br />\ncalled \"you rotten old stank<br />\nbox.\" The narrator calls the rape<br />\na \"romantic encounter,\" and<br />\nclaims he left his date and her<br /><br />\nmother \"in rapture.\"<br />\nNor does the newsletter stop<br />\nthere. It also notes that Reagan<br />\nand Mondale both have \"a BUSH<br />\nfor a running mate.\" Reference<br />\nis also made to \"Marty's bitch,\"<br />\nand (in a brother-identification<br />\nquiz) to the adjective \"bitchless.\"<br />\nNor has the Hopkins NewsLetter been exempt from prejudice under the guise of humor.<br />\nIn last year's April Fools jokeissue of the \"News-Litter,\" some<br />\nCampus Nots were sexist, racist,<br />\nand homophobic. One referred to<br />\nthe Chinese Students Association<br />\nas \"Little. Yellow. Different.\"<br />\nAnother referred to a group that<br />\nwould kidnap a good-looking IR<br />\nmajor and clone her, turning the<br />\nclone over to a Hopkins male.<br />\nThis was to solve the \"problem\"<br />\nthat Hopkins \"girls\" don't look<br />\nlike girls. Finally, another \"Not\"<br />\nimplied that someone who was<br />\ngay or lesbian didn't know<br />\nwhether they were a man or a<br />\nwoman. And the year before that,<br />\nwe had the infamous \"Gouchercondom\" strip of \"With Eyes<br />\nClosed.\"<br />\nPrejudice is not limited to<br />\nHopkins publications. Rather, it<br />\npervades our entire campus.<br />\nAlthough at least 10 percent of<br />\nHopkins students are homosexual, Gay and Lesbian Alliance<br />\nposters are constantly torn down,<br />\ngenerally within a day of being<br />\nput up. Homophobia is so bad on<br />\nthis campus that GALA officers<br />\npublically<br />\nhave<br />\nbecome<br />\nanonymous to avoid harassment.<br />\nIn lists distributed to all students,<br />\nlisting the various SAC groups<br />\nand their officers. GALA gives<br />\nonly a number which interested<br />\nstudents can call. (Perhaps this is<br />\na good time to introduce myself<br />\nas GALA's newest vicepresident.)<br />\nFurthermore, while some incidents can be chalked up to ignorance, or general hostility,<br />\nsome are so premeditated as to be<br />\nnothing less than deliberate social<br />\nviolence. One example is the<br />\nposter for the fictitious \"Goucher<br />\nGet Laid Party\" which was placed on the door of the Women's<br />\nCenter. Since last year's Center<br />\nwas hidden in the basement of<br />\nAMR II, this took a bit of effort.<br />\nThe \"Spectator's\" \"2x + 1\" car-<br /><br />\ntoon is the most recent example.<br />\nAt the end of his cartoon, Mr.<br />\nPodurgiel requests hate mail.<br />\nThus, he knew that his cartoon<br />\nwould upset a large portion of the<br />\nHopkins community\u2014indeed, he<br />\nplanned it. Well, Mr. Podurgiel,<br />\nthis isn't hate mail. What I feel<br />\nfor you is merely pity.<br />\nMartin Luther King, Jr. said<br />\nthat his generation would have to<br />\naccount not only for the terrible<br />\ndeeds of the evil few, but also for<br />\nthe appalling passivity of the good<br />\nmajority. The same is perhaps<br />\neven more true for our own<br />\ngeneration. In every party I've<br />\ngone to since I came to Hopkins<br />\nI've heard sexist and homophobic<br />\ncomments, and I suspect you<br />\nhave too. Every time you see or<br />\nhear prejudice and do nothing you<br />\ngive your tacit approval, just as<br />\nthe university will if it tolerates<br />\nthe \"Spectator\"'s cartoon. Every<br />\ntime you tell a racist, sexist, or<br /><br />\nhomophobic joke, you add to the<br />\nlevel of intolerance. In effect, you<br />\nsay you are proud to live in a<br />\ncommunity in which gays must be<br />\ncloseted, in which women and<br />\nminorities are anonymous, and<br />\nwhere prejudice is embraced as<br />\na friend.<br />\nThe problem here at Hopkins<br />\nis indeed large, but it can be solved if we all actively examine and<br />\nreform our beliefs, attitudes, and<br />\nbehavior. We all have prejudices<br />\nbuilt up in us\u2014fight yours, and<br />\nwhen others exercise theirs make<br />\nit clear you don't approve. Go to<br />\nmeetings of the Women's Center,<br />\nGALA, the BSU, the JSA, and<br />\nlearn that there's precious little<br />\nthere to hate or fear.

The mass<br />\nshowing of such an opinionated<br />\npiece may have touched off a<br />\ntirade of racial outbursts that<br />\nwould have destroyed the growing sense of cultural awareness at<br />\nHopkins. The attitudes expressed in the comic strip represent a<br />\nlong-dead image of AfricanAmericans as a lazy, selfish race.<br />\nYour unwillingness to indulge in<br />\nsuch prejudices reflects an<br />\nunderstanding and awareness of<br />\nminority groups as well as an accurate indicator of the opinions of<br />\nthe campus.

Despite<br />\nthe author's intentions, the comic strip's racist statements would<br />\noffend many people. If the strip<br />\ncould make people think about<br />\nthe problems of racism and race<br />\nrelations at Hopkins, it would do<br />\nso at the expense of insulting<br />\nmany people of that very same<br />\ncommunity. Instead of bringing<br />\npeople together, this comic strip<br />\nwould easily lead to antagonisms<br />\nthat would exacerbate rather than<br />\nalleviate racial tensions.<br />\nRacism and race relations are<br />\nvery important and sensitive<br />\nissues that affect everyone. The<br /><br />\nCarlos Pezua<br /><br />\nRosen IV<br />\nTo the Editors:<br />\nI applaud the News-Letter<br />\neditors for refusing to publish<br />\nJames Rosen's cartoon of<br />\n/<br />\n2 years, he<br />\nDecember 8. Over 31<br />\nhas used the power of his<br />\nmedium, the appeal of cartoons,<br />\nto vent any of his personal aggressions with very little accountability to the community. Unlike<br />\nother members of the News-Letter<br />\nstaff, Rosen has never been subject to editing. That Rosen never<br />\nhad any problems with any<br />\nprevious editors only shows the<br />\npoor judgement and cowardice of<br />\nEngler's<br />\nBrown<br />\nand<br />\npredecessors.<br />\nHaving been personally subjected to one of his attacks, I<br />\nrealized that there is no effective<br />\nresponse to Rosen's attacks.<br />\nMore people read the cartoon<br />\nthan the \"Letters to the Editor\"<br />\nand the image of those who complained was that of the petty<br />\nhypochondriac who was unable to<br />\nlaugh at her/himself. In addition,<br />\nRosen always had the last word<br />\nwith an additional mocking inwlt<br />\nor some insipid theory on tbe<br />\nnature of comedy.<br />\nThe idea borders on Fascism<br />\nthat Rosen should be allowed to<br />\nprint any kind of racist diatribe<br />\nsimply because the majority likes<br />\nit. Many people will say, as<br />\nRosen did, that the community<br />\nhas the right to judge for itself the<br />\nmerits of the comic. I saw the<br />\ncontroversial cartoon when the<br />\n\"Spectator\" editors showed it to<br /><br />\nSOT I THOUGHT /<br /><br />\nYOU KNOw....Some-TIMEE<br />\nYOU REALLY ANIF#26\"<br /><br />\nAT RN EXTENDED<br />\nCUIvINIERciRL,<br /><br />\nME\". ..<br /><br />\nWAS LOOKING<br />\na INFINITI\u201d<br /><br />\n1001111g<br /><br />\n1411111.4,<br /><br />\n41111.,<br /><br />\n\u201e,<br />\ney\u201e<br />\n'f co<br />\nc n<br />\n.,,.....<br /><br />\n4<br /><br />\nII<br /><br />\n/Kbtli;<br /><br />\nAli<br /><br />\nthe Black Student Union and<br />\nbelieve it would serve only to increase the level of racial alienation on campus. The cartoon is<br />\ninteresting in the sense that it<br />\nshows how a white male elitist<br />\nthinks. Yet, you do us no service.<br />\nJames, for leading us white males<br />\nto conclude that blacks are lazy,<br />\napathetic peons whose problems<br />\nare being rationalized by the<br />\n\"liberals.\" These are crucial<br />\nissues concerning race relations<br />\nin this society. Rosen's cartoon<br />\nwas not a constructive step.<br />\nGeorge Lerner<br /><br />\nRosen V<br />\nTo the Editors:<br />\nI was appalled after reading the<br />\n\"satirical\" cartoon created by<br />\nJames Rosen regarding the<br />\nworkers of the snack bar, which<br />\nwas shown to the Black Student<br />\nUnion this week. Not only is it<br />\nnot funny, but racism screams<br /><br />\nand grates at the very nerve of<br />\neven the half-hearted socially<br />\naware individual. At a campus<br />\nwhere the students and administration are maturing and<br />\nevolving towards pluralism, I<br />\ncannot believe that anyone would<br />\ndare to want to have the cartoon<br />\nprinted.<br />\nI put to Rosen: Why is it that<br />\nJohns Hopkins University, in the<br />\nbelt of African-American professionals, has very few AfricanAmerican faculty and so many<br />\nservice workers? Why is it that<br />\nHopkins students have the worst<br />\nreputation of all students in<br />\nBaltimore? They are considered<br />\narrogant, opinionated, and rude.<br />\nMaybe one can find these<br />\nanswers in the cartoon strip.<br />\nThe cartoon expresses ignorance and not even the inkling<br />\nof tolerance (the saddest word<br />\nthat could be used in reference to<br />\nethnology). Would its creator<br />\nstop at the workers of the Snack<br />\nBar'? I believe not. I could see<br /><br />\nfuture cartoons degrading<br />\nAfrican-American students at<br />\nHopkins. Would Rosen be able to<br />\nconstrain himself and not demean<br />\nother ethnic groups at Hopkins?<br />\nI doubt that very much.<br />\nAlthough there may be a select<br />\nfew who argue that one has the<br />\nfreedom of speech, I argue that<br />\nthe privilege of speech is a<br />\nresponsibility, especially when<br />\npublically voiced.

And we<br />\nknew we wanted to have a place<br />\nfor conversation and music.<br />\nHolding Hoppy Hour in the<br />\nfreshman dorms did attract a<br />\nnumber of students who had<br />\nnever been to the social before.<br />\nFreshman Kyle Gliatto is one of<br />\nthe newcomers.<br />\n\"Actually, I wasn't planning<br />\non coming. I saw something was<br />\nup and I just wandered in,\" said<br />\nKyle. \"I'll have to come back<br />\nsome time. It's really good.\"<br />\nAccording to freshman Richard<br />\nSchwartz, many of his classmates<br />\nwere under the impression that<br />\nHoppy Hour cost money, or that<br />\nthey would get carded there.<br />\n\"Having it here might attract<br />\nmore students, but I like the Glass<br />\nPavilion better. At the Glass<br />\nPavilion it was great with the<br />\nbands,\" said Richard.<br />\nAlthough there were a number<br />\nof freshmen in attendance at<br />\nvarious times, they were always<br /><br />\nfar outnumbered by the up,<br />\nperclassmen who showed up.<br />\nThis could partly be attributed to<br />\nthe special dinner in the Terrace<br />\nRoom, partly to the lack of<br />\nknowledge about Hoppy Hour.<br />\nSo why did so many upperclassmen make the trek to the<br />\ndorms? The food was not advertised in the Hopkins Halftime<br />\nflyer, so there must have been<br />\nsome other reason.<br />\n\"I never think of Hoppy !-lour<br />\nas a freshman activity,'' said<br />\nsenior Harvey Silkowitz. \"But Iwas surprised that there were so<br />\nfew freshmen at Hoppy Hour la<br />\nsemester.\"<br />\nThe best measure of success is<br />\nnot the volume of people,<br />\nhowever. By five of seven<br />\no'clock, five minutes before the<br />\nevent was scheduled to end and<br />\nlong after the hot food was gone,<br />\nstudents still filled the social<br />\nlounges and the band played on.<br />\nI doubt most people were even<br />\nSee HALFTIME, 14<br /><br />\nYOUR ID CARD ENTITLES YOU<br />\nTO THE LOWEST MACINTOSH<br />\nPRICES IN TOWN.<br />\nAs a full-time Johns Hopkins University student, staff or faculty member, you are entitled to special pricing on Macintosh\u00ae computers and<br />\nother Apple\u00ae products purchased through The Microcomputer Center.<br /><br />\nPrices start below $1789.00 for the Macintosh SE...<br />\nAnd, it can read MS-DOS\u00ae files too!<br />\nCombine the affordability of your special University Purchase pricing with the Power and Performance of the Macintosh.

In combination<br />\nwith the yogurt it was quite good.<br />\nThe kaddo borawni was even better. It tastes like pumpkin pie filling, hut the sweetness was cut by<br />\nthe yogurt garlic sauce.<br />\nFor the main course, we<br />\nordered mantwo ($7.95) and<br />\nkoufta challow ($7.95). Mantwo,<br />\na pastry shell filled with onions<br /><br />\nWe approached The Helmand,<br />\nan Afghan restaurant at 806 N.<br />\nCharles expecting food that tastes<br />\nIndian, only different. We left<br />\nbelieving that it was different in<br />\na good way, that we might consider dining there before a show<br />\ninstead of its nearby Indian<br />\nneighbors, The Akbar and The<br />\nBombay Grill.<br />\nThe first trick to enjoying the<br />\nfood is getting inside the<br />\nrestaurant. If you're approaching<br />\nit from the harbor it's easy-you<br />\ncome to a door labeled '1 he Helmand and walk in.<br />\nFrom campus, you're greeted<br />\nwith a sign that says something<br />\nlike, \"Second door over.\" What<br />\nIf you're looking for<br />\nthey need a sign on the first<br />\ndoor over that says \"keep go- something different,<br />\ning.\" While we dined we watch- The Helmand is a<br />\ned a number of people pacing<br />\nback and forth outside, staring at vPrv nond chnice to<br />\nthe people already enjoying their consider, provided<br />\nfood.<br />\nOnce inside, you are seated in that no one in your<br />\na room with only slightly-dimmed party is a vegetarian.<br />\nlight and fresh foliage on the<br />\nsmall tables.

Those<br />\nAmerican instincts would have<br />\nus head to Louie's for<br />\ncheesecake.<br />\nThe major problem with the<br />\nHelmand is that although the<br />\ndishes are novel for a newcomer,<br />\nthey lack variety. There happens<br />\nto be alot of overlap beween the<br />\nappetizers, the side dishes and the<br />\nentrees. All but one of the entrees<br />\ncontained either lamb or beef,<br />\nand there were no vegetarian entrees. They were all either meat<br />\nwith vegetables over rice or filled pasta.

This past semester the HOP went through a period of transition in which we were no longer just throwing out events to you, which you didn't want in the first place. We had a committed team of students who<br />\nwere finding out what you wanted to see take place at Hopkins and then we did just that.

There were no good protests like those<br />\nspawned by \"The Last Temptation of Christ\" in<br />\n1988 and, overall, fewer shootings at Eddie Murphy films\u2014at least in the audience. On screen it<br />\nwas mayhem as usual, and millions of Americans<br />\ntrooped off to their local movieplexes to see the<br />\nlatest and greatest in cinematic fodder.<br />\nYet for all of the obligatory half-baked ideas,<br />\nsuperstar mismatches, and just plain crummy<br />\nfilms, the year brought some memorable performances and moving moments: Michelle Pfeiffer<br />\nmolding her curves to the piano in \"The Fabulous<br />\nBaker Boys\" and Jessica Tandy taking tiny bites<br />\nof pumpkin pie from Morgan Freeman in \"Driving Miss Daisy,\" for example. There was the<br />\npainfully graphic, as well, like Mel Gibson<br />\ndislocating his shoulder underwater in \"Lethal<br />\nWeapon 2\" and Tom Cruise squirming in his own<br />\nexcrement in \"Born on the Fourth of July.\"<br />\nTop Ten lists are commonplace among critics<br />\nof all kinds. But how many critics can say that<br />\ntheir Top Ten of 1989 will first be published in<br />\nFebruary? I'm a step ahead of the Oscar nominations (I can only vote for technical awards) but<br />\nway behind almost everyone else. I offer a special<br />\nmerit award to \"Roger and Me\" for compiling<br />\nthe longest list of Top Ten citations in memory.<br />\nMy balloting officially ended last Saturday, and<br />\nafter some furious lobbying by Tom Hanks for<br />\nhis role in \"Turner and Hooch,\" I've made my<br />\ndecisions. Unfortunately, I was forced to disqualify \"In Country\" because my objectivity was<br />\nsomewhat skewed by an experience at the screen-<br /><br />\ning: A member of the audience approached me afterwards and asked if I had been<br />\nin the film.<br /><br />\nFollowing are Mark Friedman's Top Ten Films<br />\nof 1989:<br />\n1 .\"Glory\" An improbable piece of history is<br />\nbronzed for posterity by Edward Zwick (coexecutive producer of \"thirtysomething\") and a<br /><br />\nDanny DeVito and Kathleen Turner in \"The War of the Roses\"; below, the sea princess Ariel and<br />\nher best friend, Flounder, in \"The Little Mermaid\"<br /><br />\nstellar cast, led by Denzel Washington and<br />\nMorgan Freeman. Triumphant, haunting, and profoundly affecting, the actors in \"Glory\" give the<br />\nstory of the 54th Massachusetts regiment (the first<br />\nall-black volunteer unit in U.S. History) an urgency that drives the film and leaves a monument to<br /><br />\na group of men who were martyrs for more than<br />\none important cause. The best of the best.<br />\n2.\"Crimes and Misdemeanors\" Woody<br />\nAllen's nineteenth film in many ways is his richest<br />\nand most satisfyingly complex. Glowingly filmed, \"Crimes and Misdemeanors\" deftly intertwines stories of major and minor moral transgressions. The themes of lust and redemption lock<br />\nneatly into the end of the 1980s, a decade Allen<br />\nclearly identifies with our inability (or lack of<br />\ndesire) to see how bad we really are.<br />\n3.\"Do the Right Thing\" Spike Lee builds a<br />\nneighborhood and an unforgettable line-up from<br />\na blistering summer's day, the belligerent thump<br />\nof Public Enemy, and pent-up doses of<br />\nunacknowledged hostility. Lee's imagery and<br />\nideas challenge moviegoers (and the status quo)<br />\nwith a boldness unique among popular filmmakers<br />\ntoday.<br />\n4.\"Driving Miss Daisy\" Jessica Tandy and<br />\nMorgan Freeman give the best leading performances of the year in this tender story of a twentyfive year relationship between an incorrigible<br />\nJewish widow and her black chauffeur in the<br />\nSouth.

Each<br />\nof the four critics was asked to submit a list of<br />\nten favorite albums and ten favorite songs, with<br />\nthe stipulation that none of the songs could be from<br />\nany of the listed albums. The result is predictably<br />\neccentric\u2014removed from the Top 40 mainstream<br />\nin most cases, but not especially radical.<br />\nSeveral of the critics complained that they<br />\ncouldn't produce a list of the ten \"best\" records,<br />\noffering instead eight, eleven, or a group of ten<br />\nthat included a reissue or a record released late<br />\nin 1988. These deviant choices have been preserved. More complaints came about choosing<br />\nsongs\u2014\"there are just too many, man\"\u2014and<br />\nthose selections are admittedly more arbitrary than<br />\nthe album choices.<br />\nIn keeping with the democratic spirit of the<br />\nenterprise, the lists were compiled in a random<br />\norder, with songs (in quotes) and albums (italics)<br />\nmixed together. Each critic contributed at least one<br />\ndescription of a favorite release; these are interspersed throughout the list. Titles that appeared<br />\non more than one list appear below only once.<br />\nThere were several records for which the NewsLetter could not find enough information to print;<br />\nthese were omitted from the final list.<br />\nIn the end, there are no \"No. 1\" or \"No. 2\"<br />\nrecords here.

But with the exception<br />\nof that single, Cherry's debut was received with<br />\ncommercial indifference. No one seemed to know<br />\nexactly what she was about. The record's second<br />\nsingle, \"Kisses On The Wind,\" got nowhere near<br />\nthe Top 20. If it wasn't Cherry's choice of<br />\ntopics\u2014teenage sex, motherhood, responsibility,<br />\nblack market babies\u2014that put people off, it may<br />\nhave been her frank and funny rap style.

Yet for all this confusion, \"Tokyo Rose\"<br />\nis rife with subtleties. Parks' subject is the evolving relationship between the U.S. and Japan since<br />\nthe Second World War, and the music on \"Tokyo<br />\nRose\" aptly reflects the various cultural and<br />\neconomic tugs-of-war that both nations have<br />\nshared.

Cities like Minneapolis/Saint Paul and Berkeley<br />\nhave banned it. A lot of people<br />\nare probably wondering what the<br />\nbig deal is all about. Last fall I<br />\nwent on a fact finding mission<br />\nabout polystyrene foam and this<br />\nis what I found out.<br />\nStyrofoam is actually a trade<br />\nname like Thermos and Q-Tip.<br />\nThe real name is polystyrene<br />\nfoam. It is a petroleum product,<br />\nso it is using up our dwinkling<br />\nsupplies of fossil fuels. It is made<br />\nby<br />\npolymerizing<br />\nstyrene<br />\nmonomers in the prosence of<br />\nheat. A combination of ethylene<br />\nand benzene is often used in the<br />\nreaction. Styrene, ethylene and<br />\nbenzene are all toxic.<br />\nAlthough most polystyrene<br />\nfoam manufacturers no longer<br />\nuse CFC's, polystyrene foam still<br />\ncontributes to ozone depletion.<br />\nThis is because one of the most<br />\npopular alternatives to CFC is<br />\nHCFC-22. This compound is less<br />\ndamaging because it breaks up<br />\nmore readily in the lower atmosphere before it reaches the<br />\no7one laver. Unfortunately, many<br />\nintact molecules still reach the<br />\nozone layer, so HCFC is<br />\nestimated to be only 5 percent less<br />\ndamaging to the ozone layer than<br />\nthe original CFC<br />\nManufacturing polystyrene<br />\nfoam is a direct source of smog.<br />\nButane and pentane are the two<br />\nother alternatives to CFC's being<br />\nby<br />\nused<br />\nmanufacturers<br />\n(McDonald's uses pentane).

Cases<br />\nof liver damage have been found<br />\nin workers employed over five<br />\nyears. Butane and pentane are<br />\nhighly explosive and also pose a<br />\nsaftey threat.<br />\nLarge quantities of toxic waste<br />\nare produced during the manufacture of polystyrene. In fact, according to an EPA ranking of<br />\nchemicals produced in the U.S.,<br />\npolystyrene generates the fifth<br />\nlargest amount of hazardous<br />\nwaste, and its principal ingredients, ethylene and benzene, are<br />\nranked fourth and sixth<br />\nrespectively.<br />\nThe problems with polystyrene<br />\nfoam don't end when you throw<br />\nit away. Why not'? Because you<br />\nare throwing it away. Baltimore's<br />\nlandfill is due to be full in 2001.<br />\nThat's only 11 years from now.<br />\nThe simplest solution to this proDiem is to stop using<br />\n\"disposables\" like styrofoam and<br />\nto use reusable or recyclable<br />\nmaterials instead.<br />\nIn Baltimore up to 90 percent<br />\nof our garbage is burned at the<br />\nBRESCO incinerator and the incinerator on Pulaski highway.

The<br />\nJays completed their fall semester<br />\nseason at 5-1 in the league, and<br />\n9-3 overall.<br />\nThe Jays and the Hoyas both<br />\nentered the contest unbeaten in<br />\nleague play, and the battle for<br />\nfirst place lived up to its billing<br />\nas it delivered thrills from the<br />\nopening face-off. On the opening<br />\nplay, the Hoya center was at,le to<br />\ndirect the draw to his<br />\ndefenseman, who immediately atiempted to hit the left wing<br />\nstreaking down the boards in an<br />\neffort to get beyond the Hopkins<br />\ndefense. The winger ended up being set up by his teammate as<br />\ndefenseman Paul Schied had the<br />\nwinger lined up perfectly. After<br />\nviolently disposing of the Hoya<br />\nforward, Schied gained possession of the puck and passed it to<br />\nfreshman winger Jason Sprague,<br />\nwho was wide open behind the<br />\nHoya defense. Sprague unloaded<br />\na slap shot from twenty feet out,<br />\nbeating the Georgetown goalie on<br />\nthe lower lefthand side to give the<br />\nJays a 1-0 lead in the first minute<br />\nof play.<br />\nDespite the fast start, Hopkins<br />\nhad all it could handle with the<br />\nfast and powerful Georgetown<br />\nclub. The action was fast and<br />\nfurious, but due to tremendous<br />\ndefensive play in the first period,<br />\nthe Blue Jays were able to cling<br />\nto a slim 1-0 advantage. Hopkins<br />\ngoaltender Pierre Chevrier stopped ten shots in the period.<br />\nIn the second period of play,<br />\nthe Jays could no longer stave off<br />\nthe Georgetown onslaught.<br />\nPenalties hampered the Blue Jays<br />\nand two powerplay goals gave<br />\nGeorgetown a 2-1 lead. \"You<br />\ncan't afford to play a team like<br /><br />\nGeorgetown shorthanded,\" said<br />\ncoach Steve Wirth. The Jays<br />\nplayed the period very defensively with offensive opportunities<br />\ncoming few and far between.<br />\n\"We played like we were intimidated,\" said Captain Mike<br />\nHolmes. \"They weren't hitting<br />\nthat hard, but due to experience<br />\nwith them in the past years some<br />\nof our guys were psyched out<br />\nbefore they even stepped on the<br />\nice. When you slow up just as you<br />\nand a player on the other team<br />\nmeet at the puck that means that<br />\nthey'll always be making the<br />\nplay, and we'll always be reacting to it. That's why we were<br />\nforced to play so defensively.\"<br />\nThe third period was simply a<br />\nwar in which both teams played<br />\nevenly. The Jays could not afford<br />\nto play even up, however, since<br />\nthey trailed by a goal. Despite<br />\nsome good opportunities,<br />\nHopkins could not break through<br />\nwith the needed score. With just<br />\nover a minute to play the Jays<br />\nfound themselves playing shorthanded and trailing 2-1. As<br />\nGeorgetown prepared to pursue<br />\ntheir advantage by entering the<br />\nHopkins zone, Chris Crosby<br />\ndecided to take a gamble. Crosby<br />\nrushed the oncoming forward in<br />\norder to force him to pass, but<br />\nbroke off in the direction of the<br />\nnearest Hoya player just as he<br />\nsaw the pass being made. The<br />\nresult was a clean interception<br />\nand a one-on-one break. The<br />\nHoya defenseman forced Crosby<br />\nto the right of the goal, but<br />\nsomehow Crosby managed to get<br />\noff a backhand shot that fooled<br />\nthe Georgetown goalie. The shot<br />\npassed the goalie but hit the post.<br />\nSprague, trailing the play, rushed for the loose puck and got to<br />\nit just as the Georgetown goalie<br />\ndid. The two collided and the<br />\npuck came free. Crosby picked<br />\nup the loose puck and fired it in,<br />\nbut as he did so a Georgetown<br /><br />\ndefender dislodged the net from<br />\nits stand. When the goal moves,<br />\nthe puck is whistled dead, and<br />\ntherefore the goal was disallowed. The referee declared that the<br />\nnet had been removed purposely, however, and ruled that a<br />\npenalty shot be taken by Hopkins.<br />\nSprague was chosen for the task,<br />\nand the freshman displayed his<br />\nusual veteran manner as he slipped the puck between the legs of<br />\nthe Georgetown goalie to even the<br />\nscore at 2-2 with 1:05 left to play.<br />\nGeorgetown maintained its<br />\nman advantage, however, and<br />\npressed hard in the Hopkins zone.<br />\nThe two defending forwards for<br />\nthe Blue Jays got caught high at<br />\ncenter ice, and when one was<br />\nbeaten, a four-on-two break for<br />\nGeorgetown resulted. which they<br />\nwere able to convert into a score.<br />\nWith just 35 seconds left to play,<br />\nthe Hoyas took a 3-2 lead that<br />\nthey would hold.<br />\n\"I don't know what we have to<br />\ndo to beat those guys,\" exclaimed senior assistant Vinny Alfi in<br />\nreference to the fact that the Blue<br />\nJays have never beaten the<br />\nHoyas. The return engagement of<br />\nthe Hopkins-Georgetown matchup will be next semester at<br />\nGeorgetown. \"We'll be ready for<br />\nthat one, I can promise you,\"<br />\nsaid Mike Holmes..<br />\nDespite the loss, the stickmen<br />\nwere pleased with the first half of<br />\ntheir season. \"This is by far our<br />\nbest season,\" explained Alfi. \"If<br />\nyou would've told me that after<br />\nlosing the first two lines from last<br />\nyear's club we'd be 9-3, I would<br />\nhave said you were nuts.\" Added Holmes, \"Last year everyone<br />\nlooked to Billy (Marquardt) and<br />\nGibbo (Pat Gibbons) to do<br />\neverything, and when they didn't<br />\nour team folded.

The win against<br />\nLafayette was expected, but the<br />\nHaverford team was a bit of an<br />\nunknown\u2014a possible contender.<br />\nIn the end, the Hopkins swordsmen took down both schools<br />\nwith little trouble. The final<br />\nscores were Hopkins 22,<br />\nLafayette 5, and Hopkins 20,<br />\nHaverford 7.<br />\nThe foil team made a fine<br />\nshowing in both meets, winning<br />\nthe weapon each time. Co-captain<br />\nMichael Greenfield had a 4-1<br />\nrecord for the day, Yen-len Tang<br />\nfenced 3-1, and sophomore Rich<br />\nMillheiser was 4-1. In addition,<br />\nsenior Li-Kuo Kong put in a 2-0<br />\nshowing, and sophomore Matt<br />\nRosin was 2-0. While foil is often<br />\nthe uncertain link in the Hopkins<br />\nfencing chain, the squad seems to<br />\nbe gaining momentum.<br />\nThe epee team turned in a solid<br /><br />\nperformance, going 7-2 in both<br />\nmeets. Juniors Tim Train and Andrew Donnalley were undefeated<br />\nat 5-0 and 4-0, respectively.<br />\nTrain is undefeated in dual meets<br />\nthis season. Sophomore Jorge<br />\nGana was 3-2 for the day, fencing well but dropping two close<br />\nbouts to Haverford. Jason Coleman was 2-1 and Darren Miller<br />\nwas 0-1.<br />\nThe sabre team held its end,<br />\neasily defeating Lafayette 8-1 and<br />\nedging out Haverford in a much<br />\nharder-fought match. Leading the<br />\nway was junior Rob \"Frito\"<br />\nMcLay, whose 5-0 record included three of the five victories<br />\nagainst Haverford. Having a<br />\nmore difficult time was senior cocaptain<br />\nAndrew \"A.J.\"<br />\nJablonowski, 3-2 on the day, who<br />\nlost two of three against Haverford. Junior Pete Kim also<br />\nfinished the day 3-2, both losses<br />\ncoming to Haverford. Junior John<br />\nO'Connell finished with a record<br />\nof 1-1, and junior Juan Suros won<br />\nthe only bout he fenced.<br />\nCoach Dick Oles complimented the squad, \"This team<br /><br />\nhas matured from a group of unsure novices into a poised,<br />\nhungry, and well-balanced unit<br />\ncapable of winning back the<br />\nMACFA title which we let slip<br />\nthrough our fingers by one touch<br />\nlast year. But we need to take<br />\nthese meets one at a time, and we<br />\ncan expect the two toughest meets<br />\nthis weekend to be with Baruch<br />\nand William and Mary.\"<br />\nTomorrow eight schools will<br />\ngather at Hopkins for a total of<br />\nseventeen meets.
