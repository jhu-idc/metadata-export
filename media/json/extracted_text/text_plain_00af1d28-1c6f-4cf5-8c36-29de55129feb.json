In his statement to the News-Letter, Professor<br />\nHornik cited administration restriction of free expression of ideas and racial intolerance among the causes for<br />\nhis withdrawal from the Hopkins faculty.<br />\nSuch complaints have been heard before\u2014but never<br />\nfrom the professioral ranks. If true, Professor Hornik's<br />\npronouncements indicate a serious deterioration of the<br />\nacademic atmosphere of this university.<br />\nWe are not in a position to evaluate the validity of<br />\nProfessor Hornik's complaints. But we are struck by<br />\ntheir urgency and believe that further investigation is in<br />\norder. The dean of the faculty of philosophy should<br />\nmake a thorough investigation of the conditions within<br />\nthe various departments and the scholars' attitudes concerning these important points.<br />\n<br />\nMr. Baker notes that univerThis is 1061 West Lexington Street.

From<br />\nthe notebooks of one of these denizens of the tunnels we<br />\npresent the following excerpts:<br />\n44<br />\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022 The well-rounded student, the pride of our<br />\nAdmissions Office, when viewed from the top of the<br />\nsmoke stack at the powerhouse, assumes a definite pear<br />\nshape. He deserves proctors and an extended orientation<br />\nperiod. Correspondingly, the Admissions Office deserves<br />\nkudos. Could you sit through some 700 interviews with<br />\nprospective pears?<br />\n44<br />\n.\u2022 \u2022 There is no reason not to honor the DSRC.<br />\nWhen you consider that it is made up primarily of students who have had the fortitude, courage, and insight<br />\nto reside in the dormitories for four years, you can feel<br />\nonly pity. Imagine waiting semester after semester for<br />\nothers to leave, and then the moment of triumph\u2014you<br />\nare the only senior left. Why not applaud?<br />\n44<br />\n. \u2022 \u2022 The undergraduate has many, many friends.<br />\nAnd all of them vie with each other to prove that they<br />\nhave the interests of the students at heart. It is only after<br />\nthey cease to talk and begin to act that you realize that<br />\nyou don't really need so many friends.<br />\n44<br />\n.\u2022 \u2022 The attitude of the administration toward the<br />\nimitation disturbances in the dormitory quadrangle two<br />\nweeks ago indicates that next year's freshmen will have<br />\nto be on their guard lest a loud sneeze be interpreted as<br />\na breech of the Gentlemen's Code. This general crackdown on behavior in the dorms along with the penalties<br />\nimposed, being campused for three weeks, makes Hopkins sound like a girls' school. If the administration<br />\nwants the dormitory students to act like perfect gentlewomen at all times, then they should coordinate with the<br />\nAdmissions Office to insure that only women be admitted<br />\nto Hopkins in the future.<br />\n44<br />\n.\u2022 \u2022 A name like Dean Geen adds a certain<br />\ndistinction to the office. Perhaps Hopkins can find a man by<br />\nthe name of Mean, and then it could be the second school<br />\nin the country to have a rhyming dean?\"<br />\n<br />\nFarewell<br />\n<br />\nMr. Baker recalls that the university once held title to places<br />\nlike Clifton Park, which was sold<br />\nJust up the street from Lou's Musical Bar, the Bali Club and a to Baltimore City for \"a tidy<br />\nGypsy fortune-teller, is 662-64 West Baltimore Street.

This general crackdown on behavior in the dorms along with the penalties<br />\nimposed, being campused for three weeks, makes Hopkins sound like a girls' school. If the administration<br />\nwants the dormitory students to act like perfect gentlewomen at all times, then they should coordinate with the<br />\nAdmissions Office to insure that only women be admitted<br />\nto Hopkins in the future.<br />\n44<br />\n.\u2022 \u2022 A name like Dean Geen adds a certain<br />\ndistinction to the office.
