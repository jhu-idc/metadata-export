Water evaporated within<br />\nan hour and left the hair drier and<br />\nmore unruly than ever. There<br />\nwasn't a thing that could keep<br />\nthe hair smoothly in place from<br />\nmorning till night\u2014natural, soft,<br />\nlustrous.<br />\nThat's why Stacomb was introduced. .<br /><br />\nU<br /><br />\nAt last\u2014a way to keep<br />\nthe hair in place<br />\nAt first known only in California<br />\ncolleges, the story of Stacomb<br />\nquickly spread. Today, welldressed men everywhere have<br />\nfound in Stacomb what they have<br /><br />\nr1<br /><br />\nalways needed\u2014an easy, natural<br />\nway to keep the hair looking just<br />\nas they want it to look at all<br />\ntimes.<br />\nPerhaps you part your hair in<br />\nthe middle. Perhaps on the right<br />\nside. Perhaps on the left. Perhaps you comb it straight back.<br />\nIt makes no difference; Stacomb<br />\nwill keep it just the way you like<br />\nit best. A touch of it in the morning, and your hair will stay just<br />\nthe way you want it all day long.<br />\nNo matter how uncontrollable<br />\nyour hair may be after being<br />\nwashed\u2014no matter how dry and<br />\nstraggly by nature\u2014Stacomb will<br />\nkeep it in perfect order, always<br />\nsmooth, trim, lustrous.<br />\nWomen use Stacomb, too. They<br />\nfind it excellent to control stray<br />\nhairs, to make the curl stay in, and<br />\nto keep the hair severely close to the<br />\nhead in the prevailing fashion.<br />\nUse Stacomb tomorrow morning,<br />\nand look your best all day A delicate, invisible cream \u2014 non-staining and non-greasy.
