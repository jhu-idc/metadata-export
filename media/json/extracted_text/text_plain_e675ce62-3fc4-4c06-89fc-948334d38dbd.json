His task in China was<br />\nmostly concerned with framing a<br />\nPermanent constitution.

Dr. Goodnow was called<br />\nUpon to give advice on these and<br />\nsimilar questions.<br />\nIn the middle of the year 1914,<br />\nProfessor Goodnow resigned his<br />\nPosition as Constitutional Advisor<br />\nto the first republic in the Far East<br />\nand entered upon his duties as Presluent of the Johns Hopkins University, October 1, 1914.<br />\nThe successor to the Hopkins<br />\nPresident as Constitutional Advisor to the Chinese Government was<br />\nDr. William Franklin Willoughby,<br />\ngraduate of the Johns Hopkins<br />\nUniversity in 1888. Professor Willoughby has rendered valuable assistance to the United States Government since 1890, when he was an<br />\n:pert in the United States Department of Labor. Subsequently, he<br />\nrepresented this country several<br />\ntimes at international congresses<br />\nand made labor investigations for<br />\nit in Europe.<br />\nFrom 1901 to 1907, Professor<br />\nWiloughby was treasurer of Porto<br />\nRico, which was then in a formattve period of civil government. He<br />\nWas later Secretary of Porto Rico,<br />\nand President of the Executive<br />\nCouncil of the Legislative Assembly of that state from 1907 to 1909.<br />\nDr. Willoughby served as Constitutional Advisor to the Chinese<br />\nGovernment from the middle of<br />\n1914 to the middle of 1916. His<br />\nduties were similar to those of his<br />\nPredecessor. In 1916 he resigned<br />\nhis position of Advisor<br />\nto the Chinese Republic.<br />\nWhen Dr. Willoughby was in<br />\nChina, the twenty-one demands of<br />\nJapan were sent to the Chinese<br />\nGovernment at Pekin, Referring<br />\nto these demands, Dr. W. F. Willoughby stated in an interview with<br />\nthe writer on Wednesday, January<br />\n1922: \"The twenty-one demands of Japan was a case of international brigandry.

All of the three Constitutional Advisors are teachers in the<br />\ndepartment of Political Science at<br />\nthe Johns Hopkins University. Dr.<br />\nW. W.

While serving in this capacity, it can be strongly contended that he played a most important<br />\npart in the formulation of the Ten<br />\nPoints of China, which were presented before the Conference.<br />\nOne benefit gained by the Chinese through the occupation of<br />\nShantung by Japan, Dr. W. F. Willoughby states, was the awakening<br />\nin the people of China of a national<br />\nconsciousness. As to the fear in<br />\nsome circles that China is included<br />\nin the \"Yellow Peril,\" Dr. Wil<br />\n<br />\nloughby discredits that. \"China,\"<br />\nhe says, \"is more friendly to the<br />\nUnited States than to any other<br />\nnation.

Finally, one of our local beacons<br />\nof enlightenment comes to the fore with a full page discussion of the<br />\napprobious behavior of John J.

Or is it youth's revolt against<br />\nrestraint?<br />\n<br />\nDoes the mania for gambling and underdressing signify<br />\n<br />\ndegeneracy?\"<br />\nJazz is not a menace! It is the modern expression of joy, and the<br />\nfact that the two sexes are drawn together in its execution is incidental and not significant. In the war camps, away from the influence<br />\nof women, jazz served to raise the spirits of the down-hearted. Man<br />\nhas always, and quite naturally, sought the company of woman in pleasure. She is an accessory, not the cause of jazz dancing.<br />\nModern (lancing is imprescriptible.<br />\n<br />\nIt needs no repression and<br />\n<br />\nwill stand for none. There is, of course, the \"ball-room bandit,\" even<br />\nas there are extremists at all functions, who require censure. \"Petting<br />\nparties\" and \"hip-pocket heroes\" are unknown quantities to no college<br />\nman, but every such enthusiast exercises his judgment in the presence<br />\nof the opposite sex. It is generally the girl who sets the pace; the overindulging youth merely \"gets away with\" as much as he can.<br />\n<br />\nChivalry<br />\n<br />\nand respect are not dead!

PALMER'S ADDRESS<br />\nThe goal for the Spring Season Ticket Campaign set by Mr. Palmer in his address at last Thursday's Assembly is a high one, but its<br />\nattainment is by no means impossible. Success, however, will require<br />\nwork and hard work, not only on the part of a few, but on the part<br />\nof every student at the University.<br />\nThe ticket to be sold offers many advantages to the buyer and is<br />\nof itself a good selling proposition. If the student is imbued with one:tenth of Mr. Palmer:s enthusiasm, he will find no difficulty in selling his<br />\nquota.

S.<br />\nThe Johns Hopkins University<br />\nhas the unique distinction of providing the Chinese Republic with<br />\nthree consecutive constitutional advisors. One of these, Dr. W. Willoughby, who has just returned to<br />\nthe University, was the principal<br />\nadvisor to the Chinese delegation<br />\nat the Washington Conference for<br />\nLimitation of Armaments.<br />\nOn March 13, 1913, Dr. Frank<br />\nJohnson Goodnow, now President<br />\n0; the Johns Hopkins University,<br />\nWas appointed Constitutional Advisor to the Chinese Government at<br />\nPekin. His task in China was<br />\nmostly concerned with framing a<br />\nPermanent constitution. Problems<br />\na, to<br />\nShould be instituted, whether it<br />\nshould be unitary or federal in<br />\nform; or what powers should be<br />\nVested in the central government,<br />\nand which ones should be left to<br />\nthe provinces, were the questions<br />\nto be olved by the young Chinese<br />\nepublic. Dr. Goodnow was called<br />\nUpon to give advice on these and<br />\nsimilar questions.<br />\nIn the middle of the year 1914,<br />\nProfessor Goodnow resigned his<br />\nPosition as Constitutional Advisor<br />\nto the first republic in the Far East<br />\nand entered upon his duties as Presluent of the Johns Hopkins University, October 1, 1914.<br />\nThe successor to the Hopkins<br />\nPresident as Constitutional Advisor to the Chinese Government was<br />\nDr. William Franklin Willoughby,<br />\ngraduate of the Johns Hopkins<br />\nUniversity in 1888. Professor Willoughby has rendered valuable assistance to the United States Government since 1890, when he was an<br />\n:pert in the United States Department of Labor. Subsequently, he<br />\nrepresented this country several<br />\ntimes at international congresses<br />\nand made labor investigations for<br />\nit in Europe.<br />\nFrom 1901 to 1907, Professor<br />\nWiloughby was treasurer of Porto<br />\nRico, which was then in a formattve period of civil government. He<br />\nWas later Secretary of Porto Rico,<br />\nand President of the Executive<br />\nCouncil of the Legislative Assembly of that state from 1907 to 1909.<br />\nDr. Willoughby served as Constitutional Advisor to the Chinese<br />\nGovernment from the middle of<br />\n1914 to the middle of 1916. His<br />\nduties were similar to those of his<br />\nPredecessor. In 1916 he resigned<br />\nhis position of Advisor<br />\nto the Chinese Republic.<br />\nWhen Dr. Willoughby was in<br />\nChina, the twenty-one demands of<br />\nJapan were sent to the Chinese<br />\nGovernment at Pekin, Referring<br />\nto these demands, Dr. W.

All of the three Constitutional Advisors are teachers in the<br />\ndepartment of Political Science at<br />\nthe Johns Hopkins University. Dr.<br />\nW. W.

He has also been the leading Advisor to the Chinese delegation at the Washington Conference for the Limitation of Armaments. While serving in this capacity, it can be strongly contended that he played a most important<br />\npart in the formulation of the Ten<br />\nPoints of China, which were presented before the Conference.<br />\nOne benefit gained by the Chinese through the occupation of<br />\nShantung by Japan, Dr. W. F. Willoughby states, was the awakening<br />\nin the people of China of a national<br />\nconsciousness. As to the fear in<br />\nsome circles that China is included<br />\nin the \"Yellow Peril,\" Dr. Wil<br /><br />\nloughby discredits that. \"China,\"<br />\nhe says, \"is more friendly to the<br />\nUnited States than to any other<br />\nnation.

Finally, one of our local beacons<br />\nof enlightenment comes to the fore with a full page discussion of the<br />\napprobious behavior of John J. Jazz, asking at the conclusion, \"Is<br />\njazz a menace, a vehicle for sensuality? Or is it youth's revolt against<br />\nrestraint?<br /><br />\nDoes the mania for gambling and underdressing signify<br /><br />\ndegeneracy?\"<br />\nJazz is not a menace! It is the modern expression of joy, and the<br />\nfact that the two sexes are drawn together in its execution is incidental and not significant. In the war camps, away from the influence<br />\nof women, jazz served to raise the spirits of the down-hearted. Man<br />\nhas always, and quite naturally, sought the company of woman in pleasure.

PALMER'S ADDRESS<br />\nThe goal for the Spring Season Ticket Campaign set by Mr. Palmer in his address at last Thursday's Assembly is a high one, but its<br />\nattainment is by no means impossible. Success, however, will require<br />\nwork and hard work, not only on the part of a few, but on the part<br />\nof every student at the University.<br />\nThe ticket to be sold offers many advantages to the buyer and is<br />\nof itself a good selling proposition. If the student is imbued with one:tenth of Mr. Palmer:s enthusiasm, he will find no difficulty in selling his<br />\nquota.
