Details of place and travel can hardly<br />\nbe expected to interest an academic body<br />\nwhose trans-Atlantic movements are periodic<br />\nand in mass. On the other hand, a description<br />\nof the status of European bimetallism, even<br />\nif escaping the inherent weakness\u2014as has<br />\nbeen politely suggested\u2014of a dissertation on<br />\nIrish snakes, has at least the inconvenience of<br />\na class lecture out of its course. Neither of<br />\nthese dangcrs threatens a series of mere personal jottings, and nothing more than this is<br />\nhere attempted.<br />\n*<br />\n*<br />\n.To the student untried in public life, initial<br />\ncontact with political activity and diplomatic<br />\nusage is fairly thrilling. A tyro will never forget the excitement of an unexpected cipher<br />\nmessage, or the tension of a delayed reply<br />\nfrom a foreign office. He comes to realize<br />\nthat political treatises stand in the same relation to actual political life that manuals on<br />\n\"how to listen to music\" do to a Beethoven<br />\nsonata. He returns to his closet in chastened<br />\nspirit, writes to Washington for the Congressional Record, forms the acquaintance of the<br />\ncouncilmen of his ward, and proceeds thereafter to study history in the making.<br />\n*<br />\nThere is nothing which incenses a moderately patriotic American when abroad to a<br />\ngreater degree, than to hear\u2014as he repeatedly<br />\nmust\u2014the phrase \"shirt-sleeve diplomacy,\" or<br />\nsome equally picturesque idiom, applied to<br />\nAmerican international procedure. In the<br />\nlight of recent events, it would be of interest<br />\nto compare the official conduct of our own and<br />\nof foreign diplomatists for a term of years.<br />\nWhatever might be the result, certainly the<br />\npresent diplomatic representation of the<br />\nUnited -States in the leading countries of<br />\nWestern Europe\u2014General Porter in Paris,<br />\nColonel Hay in London, and Ex-President<br />\n<br />\nA.<br />\n<br />\nNo. 12<br />\n<br />\nWhite in Berlin\u2014leaves little to be desired.<br />\nThe unwholesome influence of party politics<br />\nupon diplomatic service appears in the uncertain tenure of the junior force of the several<br />\nembassies. But even here there is promise of<br />\nbetter things, and the possibility of diplomacy<br />\nas a career in the United States as in every<br />\nother civilized country, is not hopelessly<br />\nremote.<br />\n* *<br />\nNo experience in Paris recurs with the same<br />\nvivid pleasure as the simple celebration of<br />\nDecoration Day at Lafayette's grave, by a<br />\nhandful of Americans. We gathered one<br />\nwarm May afternoon in the peaceful convent<br />\nyard of the Rue de Picpusas far removed from<br />\nthe life and stir of the great city as though<br />\nleagues instead of yards intervened. Then<br />\npast the simple chapel where for a century<br />\nsuccessive black-robed figures have knelt in<br />\ncontinuous adoration\u2014up a long shaded path<br />\nto the Cimitiere des Guillotines, an enclosure<br />\nno larger than an ordinary lecture-room, with<br />\nthe unmarked remains of thirteen hundred of<br />\nthe noblest victims of the Revolution. Just<br />\noutside the portal lies the patriot\u2014in immortal<br />\nprotest against the excesses of the cause he<br />\nloved. We draped our flag about the plain<br />\nslab that marks the grave ; a few words were<br />\nspoken, and we sang as best we could our own<br />\nanthem. There is little sentiment in the telling ; but at least one of those present will<br />\nnever forget the scene.<br />\n*<br />\n*<br />\nThe one feature of English political life<br />\nwhich impresses him who has faithfully<br />\ngnawed the dry bones of Stubbs and May, and<br />\nstill hungers, is the combination of feverish<br />\nactivity and periodic relaxation. There is no<br />\nlegislative body in the world which moves at a<br />\nmore rapid, nerve-consuming pace than the<br />\nHouse of Commons ; yet woe betide the reactionists who would block the week-end<br />\nexodus to country and country-house, or endeavor to keep Parliament in session one day<br />\nafter the shooting has begun! Even in London, the summer session and the social season<br />\n<br />\n\u2022<br />\n<br />\n\f2<br />\n<br />\nTHE NEWS -LETTER.<br />\n<br />\nare identical in time, and the minister who<br />\ndines out at eight, shows himself at two receptions before ten, and is on his bench in the<br />\nHouse an half-hour later, if not a type, is far<br />\nfrom a rarity. The pictures which Mrs.<br />\nHumphrey Ward has given us of the interrelation of English social and political life are,<br />\nperhaps, exaggerated ; but the error is, I<br />\nthink, only one of degree.<br />\n*<br />\n*<br />\nTo an American the chief delight of English country house life consists in that it is<br />\nrealized literature. He sees in institutional<br />\nflesh and blood the things of which he has<br />\nread all his life\u2014and he falls utter, abject captive to their charm. The process of adaptation is not without embarrassment, and the<br />\ninitial breakfast is distinctly an ordeal ; but<br />\nadjustment comes easily, and thereafter it is<br />\nthe pleasure of hospitality without the burden<br />\nof entertainment. Of course it is no longer<br />\nthe life of Sir Roger de Coverly, nor even of<br />\nBracebridge Hall ; but characteristic elements<br />\nstill abound and make rural residence the distinctive feature of English social life. Perhaps we too in America shall some time stop<br />\n\"getting a living\" and proceed to live, but the<br />\nlikelihood is not immediate.<br />\n*<br />\nFrom London and diplomacy to Carlsbad<br />\nand its life is a far cry, and yet few things delight in the retrospect so much as the incidents of a brief sojourn in this old Bohemian<br />\nspa. Mr. Howell spent four weeks there last<br />\nsummer, and perhaps we shall not have to<br />\nwait much longer for a Carlsbad novel.<br />\nSurely the author, whoever he is to be, will not<br />\nsuffer from lack of incident and color. The<br />\ncosmopolitan clientele, the apotheosis of \"the<br />\nwaters,\" the gravity of the Kur-Gaste, the simplicity of the life, the beauty of the environment, the glory of the music\u2014all flash upon<br />\none in but a fraction of the second necessary<br />\nto record them. Someone has said that the<br />\nhappiness of life consists in being paid for<br />\ndoing that which you enjoy doing. Perhaps<br />\na no less keen satisfaction results from doing<br />\nnothing and feeling virtuos\u2014and this is a<br />\ncharacteristic of incidental Carlsbad residence.<br />\nJ. H.

It was a decided success.<br />\nThe Banjo and Mandolin Clubs played with a<br />\ndash and skill that completely captivated the<br />\naudience, but the Glee Club was doubtless the<br />\nmost popular. It is very remarkable that a<br />\nGlee Club which has only existed two years<br />\nshould have sung with such delicate shading<br />\nand rich harmony. The Johns Hopkins Musical Clubs have always been famous, but they<br />\nhave never surpassed their efforts of last Friday evening.

MEDLEY POPULARIANiE,.<br />\nGlee and Banjo Clubs.<br />\n<br />\nTwo chess tables have recently made their<br />\nappearance in a corner of the Common Room<br />\nof the Gymnasium, and represent the temporary headquarters of the Chess Club. They<br />\nhave proved quite a drawing card. A game is<br />\nnearly always in progress at one or both of<br />\nthem, and there is generally a little group of<br />\nonlookers who watch the game and pass chaffing comments on the play and players.<br />\n<br />\n\fTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\nNEWS OF A FORTNIGHT.<br />\nKNOW-NOTITINOISM.<br />\n<br />\nMr. Schmeckebier read a very interesting<br />\npaper before the Historical and Political<br />\nScience Association on Friday evening, on<br />\n\"The Know-Nothing Party in Maryland.\"<br />\nMr. Schmeckebier traced the growth of this,<br />\nthe most curious and unique of the many political organizations which have flourished in<br />\nAmerican politics. The causes for the use of<br />\nthis secret society seems to be due to the<br />\nstrong anti-foreign and anti-Catholic feelings<br />\nwhich were prevalent at the time. Local issues all over the country gave rise to similar<br />\nexpressions of these feelings, though we can<br />\nhardly say that there was ever a natural Know<br />\nNothing party. Its forces were largely recruited by members of the then tottering and<br />\nexpiring Whig party\u2014men who were naturally unwilling to affiliate with their political<br />\nenemies, the Democrats. Opinions differ as<br />\nto the degree to which the Know Nothing<br />\nparty was responsible for the rioting of the<br />\nperiod. Rioting had existed before the rise<br />\nof the party, but it is very evident that the excesses were carried to a much greater extent<br />\nin 1856, during the rule of the Know Nothing<br />\nparty, than ever before. Very interesting extracts were read from diaries and newspapers<br />\nof the day touching upon the subject.<br />\nMr. Schmeckebier's paper, which is the basis<br />\nof his doctor's thesis, was very highly commended, both for his treatment of the subject<br />\nand for the scholarly research evinced.<br />\n<br />\n3<br />\n<br />\nUniversity is co-operation of labors, not only<br />\namong students, but also among professors.<br />\nAt present stray meetings are held from time<br />\nto time, and practically little interest is shown.<br />\nVarious schemes have been suggested, such<br />\nas a common meeting place, where acquaintances and good fellowship might be cultivated.<br />\nWe would suggest that accommodations might<br />\nbe obtained in the gymnasium and cage, where<br />\na closer union of interests of the graduate and<br />\nundergraduate students would be heartily welcomed by the latter. ,<br />\nTHE DEBATE.<br />\n<br />\nOn Friday evening, March 25, the muchheralded prize debate will take place. On that<br />\nevening the seniors will strive with every effort to prove that they are the ablest, clearest<br />\nthinking class in the University, while the<br />\njuniors will most ardently claim that distinction for their class. The teams which are to<br />\ndebate have been finally chosen, and, we feel<br />\nassured, represent the brains and speaking<br />\nability of each class. The debaters from the<br />\nclass of '98 are Senators Stearns, Ballard and<br />\nUlman; from the class of '99, Congressmen<br />\nMorgan, French and Guggenheimer. The<br />\nquestion that will be debated is, \"Resolved,<br />\nThat immigration should be further reBoth teams, it is generally bestricted.\"<br />\nlieved, have by this time assimilated the literature upon the subject, and are now dexterously<br />\narranging their arguments for final presentation. The class of 'oo will compete for a prize<br />\nto be awarded to the best speaker of the evening, and, in view of the slight intimations that<br />\nGRADUATES' ASSOCIATION.<br />\n.have thus far been given out, the seniors and<br />\nThe Graduate Students' Association has juniors will have to look well to their laurels.<br />\nThis occasion will practically close the sesbeen reorganized for the year, with W.

When the House defeated it recently, we, for a time, lost all hope for it; but<br />\nlater developments are more encouraging, and<br />\nit is still possible that Hopkins may get at least<br />\na portion of the aid she has asked for. At any<br />\nrate, we will continue to hope.<br />\nWe are of those who have great faith in the<br />\ngood intentions of our country legislators. Of<br />\ncourse, they wish to economize, but we trust<br />\nthey will realize that it is false economy to<br />\nallow so great an institution to decay for want<br />\nof temporary aid\u2014an institution which is, in<br />\nfact, part of the honor and dignity of the State<br />\nin the eyes of all foreigners and neighbors, if<br />\nnot of her own citizens. Should the Hopkins<br />\nfail for want of help at this time, no Marylander<br />\ncould meet an outsider for years to come without the parsimony of his native State being<br />\nthrown in his teeth, and the Marylander would<br />\nhave to take his punishment in silence. The<br />\namount asked is about 5 cents per head for the<br />\ntwo years\u2014a small sum to keep the State from<br />\nbeing a sneer and a byword for narrow-minded<br />\nparsimony. Some of the objections given are<br />\nwhat we may call personal to the Hopkins.<br />\n<br />\nThey may be meant in all seriousness, but<br />\nmake us smile. Thus we, the students are accused of putting on \"airs,' and of having too<br />\nmuch money. As for the first, no more surely<br />\ndoes he who enters Inferno leave Hope _behind<br />\nthan does the newcomer at the Hopkins drop<br />\nall \"airs;\" that is one thing they have to shed,<br />\neven as the crab constituent of Hon. Mr. Tull<br />\nhas to shed his shell, or the snake of the Hon.<br />\nMr. Morris' district has to shed his skin to the<br />\nhorny part of the eye, if he wishes to thrive.<br />\nAs for the wealth, may the Hon. Gentlemen<br />\nnever rise from the table as empty in pocket as<br />\nmost of us at this time of year. All this shows<br />\none thing, however\u2014it shows that we need to<br />\nbe a little better acquainted. Let some of our<br />\nHon. Friends pay us, the students, a social call,<br />\nand let us show them around. Ask for one of<br />\nthe editors of the NEWS-LETTER, and we will<br />\nmake you feel at home. No, gentlemen of the<br />\nHouse and Senate, most of us are good looking, but we are neither haughty of stomach or<br />\nproud of purse.<br />\n<br />\nMR. MACKDERMOTT'S WORK.<br />\n<br />\nThe rumored resignation of Mr. Mackdermott from the position of coach and director<br />\nof track athletics at the University will prove a<br />\ngrievous disappointment to all the students<br />\nwho have worked with him and know how invaluable his voluntary service has been, in the<br />\npast and the present, to that branch of our<br />\nathletics. The development in the past two<br />\nyears of a creditable relay team has been entirely due to his efforts. To expect Mr. Mackdermott to continue his generous assistance indefinitely, without any of the recompense which<br />\nhis services so well deserve, but which the University in her present financial straits cannot<br />\ngive him, is beyond reason. And if he decides<br />\nto leave us on this account, no one can at all<br />\nblame him for so doing. At any rate, whether<br />\nhe stays or goes, Mr. Mackdermott may feel<br />\nsure of the hearty gratitude of all the students<br />\nto him for his past good will and good deeds<br />\ntoward them, and a thorough sympathy with<br />\nhis present work on the track candidates.<br />\n<br />\n\fTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\nA POINT FOR CONSIDERATION.<br />\n<br />\n5<br />\n<br />\nsells to a purchaser, who has no such opportunities of knowledge, securities which they<br />\nboth suppose to be of value\u2014a supposition<br />\nwhich is the main support of the purchaser.<br />\nWhen these securities fail him, and his business<br />\nis about to be destroyed, he asks the other for<br />\nassistance.

The players on both sides worked<br />\nhard, and put up one of the best games of the<br />\nyear. Although Hopkins finished in third<br />\nplace, the members of the team deserve much<br />\ncredit for their good work and determination.<br />\nSeveral times the team was so disheartened by<br />\nthe loss of some of its good players that it contemplated dropping out of the League. But<br />\na few determined men kept together and<br />\npulled through the season very creditably.

This spirit<br />\nis not, now, dead; but it is more dormant than<br />\never before.

We are now called on to make<br />\nthe best possible application of the efforts of<br />\nthese men.<br />\nUnder our present system of athletic government, undergraduates plan programs, and<br />\ngames; make dates for them; collect and pay<br />\nSPRING GAMES.<br />\nmoney for them; and stimulate themselves to<br />\nin them.

The usual athletic events were de- same team, under the same manager is, at<br />\ncided upon. The board laid out the football present, again in straits. The manager, whom<br />\nwe consider to be stirred by the best of intenschedule for next season.<br />\n<br />\n\fTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\ntions, tells us that he is personally in debt for<br />\nthe team. He holds on cheerfully to his<br />\npolicy in the hope that some future rink manager will be stricken with an attack of liberality. We assure him that if any symptoms of it<br />\never show themselves in a rink manager, they<br />\nwill be promptly checked by the rink owners.<br />\nA business man could tell him that he will get<br />\nnothing from such a corporation except by<br />\nsound sense, and diplomatic action. Again,<br />\nour football manager of last fall was advised<br />\nby every sign of the times, and the weather<br />\noffice, on a Wednesday morning that rain<br />\nwould be falling heavily in the afternoon, when<br />\nthe Haverford eleven was scheduled to play<br />\nour's at Maryland Oval. He was advised to<br />\ncancel the game, and save eighty-five dollars,<br />\nguarantee and expenses ; but he did not do so.<br />\nThis game, like the hockey benefit game, was<br />\nplayed. Twenty dollars worth of spectators<br />\nsaw it from the slushy side lines. But our<br />\nmanager was no whit cast down ; for, said he,<br />\n\"We don't lose anything. It's all subscribed.\"<br />\nNever again let us blame ourselves with being<br />\nloath to subscribe ! And yet, in our opinion,<br />\nthis same football manager was the most energetic one that we remember ; and made the<br />\ngamest and happiest fight we ever saw against<br />\nthe most disheartening conditions that a Hopkins manager ever faced. Nearer still, we<br />\nhave seen the tiresome spectacle of our baseball captain juggling for ten dubious days with<br />\nan uncertain man of doubtful recommendation, when a man of known ability had volunteered his services. We might have enjoyed<br />\nthe juggling, had it not shut three of our teams<br />\nout of the cage when the cage was vitally<br />\nnecessary to the improvement of our teams.<br />\nAnd yet we quite agree with those who call<br />\nthis captain the ablest that we remember to<br />\nhave captained a Hopkins ball team. We find<br />\nno fault with these men, and seek to find none.<br />\nWe believe them to be the best Hopkins officials we have known, excepting always the<br />\nlacrosse captain of last year. But such blunders as these have made us bankrupt. We<br />\nmention them to show that the best our undergraduate business men can do is not good<br />\nenough.<br />\nThey are ignorant, second, of athletics.<br />\nThey know nothing of the athletic world and<br />\n<br />\n7<br />\n<br />\nits people, and no ideas and methods but their<br />\nown. The list of events for the State games<br />\nto be held May 21 is an excellent example of<br />\nathletic ignorance. This is a garbled copy of<br />\nthe official list of the National meets of the<br />\nNational Intercollegiate Association. It is interminable. The gentlemen who made it no<br />\ndoubt failed to observe that the National Association devotes two days to what they have<br />\nforced the State to do in one afternoon. The<br />\nmeet may not end in the moonlight ; but it<br />\nwill certainly weary many a patient watcher.<br />\nA practical athlete with a knowledge of detail<br />\nnever could have been guilty of such a<br />\nproduct.<br />\nThird, the usual undergraduate is unable,<br />\nalone, to keep a number of men interested in<br />\ntheir work. He lacks that knowledge of men,<br />\nwhich comes with age and experience. We<br />\nknow that the officers of our present lacrosse<br />\nteam have honestly and earnestly done their<br />\nwork, and should be honored for it. But compare the spirit of the team with the spirit of<br />\nthe team of last year, and see what knowledge<br />\nof men and means is worth.<br />\nAnd, moreover, the undergraduate's class<br />\nduties hinder him from giving a proper<br />\namount of attention to his managerial duties.<br />\nAn important letter to be written has before<br />\nnow been laid aside at the ringing of the period<br />\nbell, and forgotten. Many an overworked<br />\nmanager has resigned in favor of a new man,<br />\nand subjected our teams to all the harm that<br />\nthis implies.<br />\nWhenever athletics are a credit to any<br />\nschool these facts have been discovered. It is<br />\ntime they are mentioned here. No successful<br />\nathletic system is anywhere guided by undergraduates. Our's should not be. The present efforts of our undergraduates are hopeless.<br />\nBut they can become a credit to us, and to our<br />\nschool, if directed by knowledge.<br />\nIf any deny these statements, we retract<br />\nthem. We will wax mendacious, and concede<br />\nthat the undergraduates are shrewd business<br />\nmen ; are familiar with athletics in general,<br />\nand in detail ; know each other, and how to<br />\nmove each other ; and have unlimited leisure<br />\nin which to apply their knowledge. Even so,<br />\nthe undergraduate management of today differs from that gone, and from that to come.<br />\n<br />\n\f8<br />\n<br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\n<br />\nIt changes from year to year. Under such<br />\nconditions, a fixed policy of management is<br />\nimpossible. And if success is to last more<br />\nthan a day, a fixed policy is imperatively demanded.<br />\nA business man and athlete should direct<br />\nour athletic work just as truly as a business<br />\nman and scholar should direct our scholastic<br />\nwork. He should be consulted, and respectfully consulted, in every matter that in any<br />\nway affects our athletic reputation. His<br />\nknowledge of business should make his decision final in making games with other<br />\nschools, in guarantee terms, in transportation<br />\nof teams, and in all the insignificant details<br />\nwhich are likely to become elephants,<br />\nand swallow up all that has been \"subscribed.\"<br />\nHis knowledge of athletics should make his<br />\nauthority final in the planning of games,<br />\nmeets, and schedules. His knowledge of people would enable him to stimulate the men<br />\nand keep them at the work which his business<br />\nand athletic sense projected. His active supervision should be continuous, not the \"tenminutes-between periods\" spasm of the undergraduate, nor the occasional hour snatched<br />\nfrom a law or medical practice by an industrious, but willing alumnus. It should employ his full time. He should be at the work<br />\nall day, and all night, when necessary. His<br />\nscope of action should be as wide as the field<br />\nto be won. He should be accountable to no<br />\nauthority except the just authority of the faculty ; and should defer to no one except to<br />\nsuch a representative of the faculty as we now<br />\nhave in Dr. Renouf.<br />\nThe employment of such a man with such<br />\npowers would not at all change our present<br />\nsystem of athletic government. On the contrary it would make profitable much hard and<br />\nearnest work now wasted. Such an officer<br />\nwould be an invaluable advisor to the Governing Board of the General Athletic Association.<br />\nHe would be a confidant of managers of teams.<br />\nAnd he would co-operate with coaches to support the authority of captains. Without interfering with the coaches, he could assist them ;<br />\nand the authoritative rebuke of one up to<br />\nwhom they look would be far more effective to<br />\nbacksliding men than the feeble complainings<br />\n<br />\nof team officials whose desire for popularity<br />\nwill not permit them to be disagreeable.<br />\n\"These statements are but theoretical,\" you<br />\nmay say. We admit it. However, at the<br />\nsame time, the theories are not discoveries.<br />\nThey have been deduced from the success and<br />\nfailure of many places. And our conclusion<br />\nis justified by facts at every point. The University of Chicago, in a few years, is risen from<br />\nan athletic nonenity to be the athletic center of<br />\nthe west. Mr. F. A. Stagg is in charge of its<br />\nathletics, and he wields the powers we have described. In some great eastern colleges,<br />\nmuch of the athletic supervision is in charge of<br />\nalumni ; but these are not one-hour men.<br />\nThey are men who have taken root in their<br />\npositions until they have formed a whole corps<br />\nof such officers as we have described. Pennsylvania has its Faries and Murphy. Yale has<br />\nits Seaver Cook and Camp. Princeton has<br />\nits Goldie Fine. We may never be as great<br />\nin athletics as these ; we are surely not, at<br />\npresent, too important to imitate them.<br />\nThe authority of such a position as we have<br />\noutlined could not be conferred on anyone except by our trustees and faculty, to whom<br />\nthe holder of it would be responsible. But it<br />\nwould be strengthened by the consent of those<br />\nwhom he would direct. We believe that all<br />\nundergraduates will feel the need of putting<br />\nour athletics in the charge of one able to take<br />\ncare of them. And it should be their duty to<br />\nmake our trustees and faculty feel as they<br />\nthemselves do. We have the deepest confidence in the desire of the trustees and faculty<br />\nto do all in their power to advance our athletic<br />\ninterests. We do not call on them to add a<br />\nsecond donation to their generous gift ; but<br />\nask them only to complete it. We ask them<br />\nonly to give us the guide to make the new<br />\nquarters profitable. If we can convince them<br />\nof the justice of our request, two years should<br />\nbring a golden age when \"subscriptions\" will<br />\nno longer be sought, and the Johns Hopkins<br />\nGeneral Athletic Association will pay diviZED MARSHALL BALLARD.<br />\ndends.<br />\nDr. Ira Remsen represented the University<br />\nat the annual banquet of the Johns Hopkins<br />\nAlumni of New York City, given last week.<br />\n<br />\n\f1<br />\n<br />\n-.10191r<br />\n<br />\nTHE UNIVERSITY SCHOOL F2R BOYS<br />\nW.<br />\n<br />\nS.

Details of place and travel can hardly<br />\nbe expected to interest an academic body<br />\nwhose trans-Atlantic movements are periodic<br />\nand in mass. On the other hand, a description<br />\nof the status of European bimetallism, even<br />\nif escaping the inherent weakness\u2014as has<br />\nbeen politely suggested\u2014of a dissertation on<br />\nIrish snakes, has at least the inconvenience of<br />\na class lecture out of its course. Neither of<br />\nthese dangcrs threatens a series of mere personal jottings, and nothing more than this is<br />\nhere attempted.<br />\n*<br />\n*<br />\n.To the student untried in public life, initial<br />\ncontact with political activity and diplomatic<br />\nusage is fairly thrilling. A tyro will never forget the excitement of an unexpected cipher<br />\nmessage, or the tension of a delayed reply<br />\nfrom a foreign office. He comes to realize<br />\nthat political treatises stand in the same relation to actual political life that manuals on<br />\n\"how to listen to music\" do to a Beethoven<br />\nsonata. He returns to his closet in chastened<br />\nspirit, writes to Washington for the Congressional Record, forms the acquaintance of the<br />\ncouncilmen of his ward, and proceeds thereafter to study history in the making.<br />\n*<br />\nThere is nothing which incenses a moderately patriotic American when abroad to a<br />\ngreater degree, than to hear\u2014as he repeatedly<br />\nmust\u2014the phrase \"shirt-sleeve diplomacy,\" or<br />\nsome equally picturesque idiom, applied to<br />\nAmerican international procedure. In the<br />\nlight of recent events, it would be of interest<br />\nto compare the official conduct of our own and<br />\nof foreign diplomatists for a term of years.<br />\nWhatever might be the result, certainly the<br />\npresent diplomatic representation of the<br />\nUnited -States in the leading countries of<br />\nWestern Europe\u2014General Porter in Paris,<br />\nColonel Hay in London, and Ex-President<br /><br />\nA.<br /><br />\nNo. 12<br /><br />\nWhite in Berlin\u2014leaves little to be desired.<br />\nThe unwholesome influence of party politics<br />\nupon diplomatic service appears in the uncertain tenure of the junior force of the several<br />\nembassies. But even here there is promise of<br />\nbetter things, and the possibility of diplomacy<br />\nas a career in the United States as in every<br />\nother civilized country, is not hopelessly<br />\nremote.<br />\n* *<br />\nNo experience in Paris recurs with the same<br />\nvivid pleasure as the simple celebration of<br />\nDecoration Day at Lafayette's grave, by a<br />\nhandful of Americans. We gathered one<br />\nwarm May afternoon in the peaceful convent<br />\nyard of the Rue de Picpusas far removed from<br />\nthe life and stir of the great city as though<br />\nleagues instead of yards intervened. Then<br />\npast the simple chapel where for a century<br />\nsuccessive black-robed figures have knelt in<br />\ncontinuous adoration\u2014up a long shaded path<br />\nto the Cimitiere des Guillotines, an enclosure<br />\nno larger than an ordinary lecture-room, with<br />\nthe unmarked remains of thirteen hundred of<br />\nthe noblest victims of the Revolution. Just<br />\noutside the portal lies the patriot\u2014in immortal<br />\nprotest against the excesses of the cause he<br />\nloved. We draped our flag about the plain<br />\nslab that marks the grave ; a few words were<br />\nspoken, and we sang as best we could our own<br />\nanthem. There is little sentiment in the telling ; but at least one of those present will<br />\nnever forget the scene.<br />\n*<br />\n*<br />\nThe one feature of English political life<br />\nwhich impresses him who has faithfully<br />\ngnawed the dry bones of Stubbs and May, and<br />\nstill hungers, is the combination of feverish<br />\nactivity and periodic relaxation. There is no<br />\nlegislative body in the world which moves at a<br />\nmore rapid, nerve-consuming pace than the<br />\nHouse of Commons ; yet woe betide the reactionists who would block the week-end<br />\nexodus to country and country-house, or endeavor to keep Parliament in session one day<br />\nafter the shooting has begun! Even in London, the summer session and the social season<br /><br />\n\u2022<br /><br />\n2<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS -LETTER.<br /><br />\nare identical in time, and the minister who<br />\ndines out at eight, shows himself at two receptions before ten, and is on his bench in the<br />\nHouse an half-hour later, if not a type, is far<br />\nfrom a rarity. The pictures which Mrs.<br />\nHumphrey Ward has given us of the interrelation of English social and political life are,<br />\nperhaps, exaggerated ; but the error is, I<br />\nthink, only one of degree.<br />\n*<br />\n*<br />\nTo an American the chief delight of English country house life consists in that it is<br />\nrealized literature. He sees in institutional<br />\nflesh and blood the things of which he has<br />\nread all his life\u2014and he falls utter, abject captive to their charm. The process of adaptation is not without embarrassment, and the<br />\ninitial breakfast is distinctly an ordeal ; but<br />\nadjustment comes easily, and thereafter it is<br />\nthe pleasure of hospitality without the burden<br />\nof entertainment. Of course it is no longer<br />\nthe life of Sir Roger de Coverly, nor even of<br />\nBracebridge Hall ; but characteristic elements<br />\nstill abound and make rural residence the distinctive feature of English social life. Perhaps we too in America shall some time stop<br />\n\"getting a living\" and proceed to live, but the<br />\nlikelihood is not immediate.<br />\n*<br />\nFrom London and diplomacy to Carlsbad<br />\nand its life is a far cry, and yet few things delight in the retrospect so much as the incidents of a brief sojourn in this old Bohemian<br />\nspa. Mr. Howell spent four weeks there last<br />\nsummer, and perhaps we shall not have to<br />\nwait much longer for a Carlsbad novel.<br />\nSurely the author, whoever he is to be, will not<br />\nsuffer from lack of incident and color. The<br />\ncosmopolitan clientele, the apotheosis of \"the<br />\nwaters,\" the gravity of the Kur-Gaste, the simplicity of the life, the beauty of the environment, the glory of the music\u2014all flash upon<br />\none in but a fraction of the second necessary<br />\nto record them. Someone has said that the<br />\nhappiness of life consists in being paid for<br />\ndoing that which you enjoy doing. Perhaps<br />\na no less keen satisfaction results from doing<br />\nnothing and feeling virtuos\u2014and this is a<br />\ncharacteristic of incidental Carlsbad residence.<br />\nJ. H. H.<br /><br />\nTHE CONCERT.<br /><br />\nThe University Banjo, Mandolin and Glee<br />\nClubs gave their annual concert at Lehmann's,<br />\nFriday, March 18. It was a decided success.<br />\nThe Banjo and Mandolin Clubs played with a<br />\ndash and skill that completely captivated the<br />\naudience, but the Glee Club was doubtless the<br />\nmost popular. It is very remarkable that a<br />\nGlee Club which has only existed two years<br />\nshould have sung with such delicate shading<br />\nand rich harmony. The Johns Hopkins Musical Clubs have always been famous, but they<br />\nhave never surpassed their efforts of last Friday evening.

MEDLEY POPULARIANiE,.<br />\nGlee and Banjo Clubs.<br /><br />\nTwo chess tables have recently made their<br />\nappearance in a corner of the Common Room<br />\nof the Gymnasium, and represent the temporary headquarters of the Chess Club. They<br />\nhave proved quite a drawing card. A game is<br />\nnearly always in progress at one or both of<br />\nthem, and there is generally a little group of<br />\nonlookers who watch the game and pass chaffing comments on the play and players.<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\nNEWS OF A FORTNIGHT.<br />\nKNOW-NOTITINOISM.<br /><br />\nMr. Schmeckebier read a very interesting<br />\npaper before the Historical and Political<br />\nScience Association on Friday evening, on<br />\n\"The Know-Nothing Party in Maryland.\"<br />\nMr. Schmeckebier traced the growth of this,<br />\nthe most curious and unique of the many political organizations which have flourished in<br />\nAmerican politics. The causes for the use of<br />\nthis secret society seems to be due to the<br />\nstrong anti-foreign and anti-Catholic feelings<br />\nwhich were prevalent at the time. Local issues all over the country gave rise to similar<br />\nexpressions of these feelings, though we can<br />\nhardly say that there was ever a natural Know<br />\nNothing party. Its forces were largely recruited by members of the then tottering and<br />\nexpiring Whig party\u2014men who were naturally unwilling to affiliate with their political<br />\nenemies, the Democrats. Opinions differ as<br />\nto the degree to which the Know Nothing<br />\nparty was responsible for the rioting of the<br />\nperiod. Rioting had existed before the rise<br />\nof the party, but it is very evident that the excesses were carried to a much greater extent<br />\nin 1856, during the rule of the Know Nothing<br />\nparty, than ever before. Very interesting extracts were read from diaries and newspapers<br />\nof the day touching upon the subject.<br />\nMr. Schmeckebier's paper, which is the basis<br />\nof his doctor's thesis, was very highly commended, both for his treatment of the subject<br />\nand for the scholarly research evinced.<br /><br />\n3<br /><br />\nUniversity is co-operation of labors, not only<br />\namong students, but also among professors.<br />\nAt present stray meetings are held from time<br />\nto time, and practically little interest is shown.<br />\nVarious schemes have been suggested, such<br />\nas a common meeting place, where acquaintances and good fellowship might be cultivated.<br />\nWe would suggest that accommodations might<br />\nbe obtained in the gymnasium and cage, where<br />\na closer union of interests of the graduate and<br />\nundergraduate students would be heartily welcomed by the latter. ,<br />\nTHE DEBATE.<br /><br />\nOn Friday evening, March 25, the muchheralded prize debate will take place. On that<br />\nevening the seniors will strive with every effort to prove that they are the ablest, clearest<br />\nthinking class in the University, while the<br />\njuniors will most ardently claim that distinction for their class. The teams which are to<br />\ndebate have been finally chosen, and, we feel<br />\nassured, represent the brains and speaking<br />\nability of each class. The debaters from the<br />\nclass of '98 are Senators Stearns, Ballard and<br />\nUlman; from the class of '99, Congressmen<br />\nMorgan, French and Guggenheimer. The<br />\nquestion that will be debated is, \"Resolved,<br />\nThat immigration should be further reBoth teams, it is generally bestricted.\"<br />\nlieved, have by this time assimilated the literature upon the subject, and are now dexterously<br />\narranging their arguments for final presentation. The class of 'oo will compete for a prize<br />\nto be awarded to the best speaker of the evening, and, in view of the slight intimations that<br />\nGRADUATES' ASSOCIATION.<br />\n.have thus far been given out, the seniors and<br />\nThe Graduate Students' Association has juniors will have to look well to their laurels.<br />\nThis occasion will practically close the sesbeen reorganized for the year, with W.

When the House defeated it recently, we, for a time, lost all hope for it; but<br />\nlater developments are more encouraging, and<br />\nit is still possible that Hopkins may get at least<br />\na portion of the aid she has asked for. At any<br />\nrate, we will continue to hope.<br />\nWe are of those who have great faith in the<br />\ngood intentions of our country legislators. Of<br />\ncourse, they wish to economize, but we trust<br />\nthey will realize that it is false economy to<br />\nallow so great an institution to decay for want<br />\nof temporary aid\u2014an institution which is, in<br />\nfact, part of the honor and dignity of the State<br />\nin the eyes of all foreigners and neighbors, if<br />\nnot of her own citizens. Should the Hopkins<br />\nfail for want of help at this time, no Marylander<br />\ncould meet an outsider for years to come without the parsimony of his native State being<br />\nthrown in his teeth, and the Marylander would<br />\nhave to take his punishment in silence. The<br />\namount asked is about 5 cents per head for the<br />\ntwo years\u2014a small sum to keep the State from<br />\nbeing a sneer and a byword for narrow-minded<br />\nparsimony. Some of the objections given are<br />\nwhat we may call personal to the Hopkins.<br /><br />\nThey may be meant in all seriousness, but<br />\nmake us smile. Thus we, the students are accused of putting on \"airs,' and of having too<br />\nmuch money. As for the first, no more surely<br />\ndoes he who enters Inferno leave Hope _behind<br />\nthan does the newcomer at the Hopkins drop<br />\nall \"airs;\" that is one thing they have to shed,<br />\neven as the crab constituent of Hon. Mr. Tull<br />\nhas to shed his shell, or the snake of the Hon.<br />\nMr. Morris' district has to shed his skin to the<br />\nhorny part of the eye, if he wishes to thrive.<br />\nAs for the wealth, may the Hon. Gentlemen<br />\nnever rise from the table as empty in pocket as<br />\nmost of us at this time of year. All this shows<br />\none thing, however\u2014it shows that we need to<br />\nbe a little better acquainted. Let some of our<br />\nHon. Friends pay us, the students, a social call,<br />\nand let us show them around. Ask for one of<br />\nthe editors of the NEWS-LETTER, and we will<br />\nmake you feel at home.

MACKDERMOTT'S WORK.<br /><br />\nThe rumored resignation of Mr. Mackdermott from the position of coach and director<br />\nof track athletics at the University will prove a<br />\ngrievous disappointment to all the students<br />\nwho have worked with him and know how invaluable his voluntary service has been, in the<br />\npast and the present, to that branch of our<br />\nathletics. The development in the past two<br />\nyears of a creditable relay team has been entirely due to his efforts. To expect Mr. Mackdermott to continue his generous assistance indefinitely, without any of the recompense which<br />\nhis services so well deserve, but which the University in her present financial straits cannot<br />\ngive him, is beyond reason. And if he decides<br />\nto leave us on this account, no one can at all<br />\nblame him for so doing. At any rate, whether<br />\nhe stays or goes, Mr. Mackdermott may feel<br />\nsure of the hearty gratitude of all the students<br />\nto him for his past good will and good deeds<br />\ntoward them, and a thorough sympathy with<br />\nhis present work on the track candidates.<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\nA POINT FOR CONSIDERATION.<br /><br />\n5<br /><br />\nsells to a purchaser, who has no such opportunities of knowledge, securities which they<br />\nboth suppose to be of value\u2014a supposition<br />\nwhich is the main support of the purchaser.<br />\nWhen these securities fail him, and his business<br />\nis about to be destroyed, he asks the other for<br />\nassistance.

The players on both sides worked<br />\nhard, and put up one of the best games of the<br />\nyear. Although Hopkins finished in third<br />\nplace, the members of the team deserve much<br />\ncredit for their good work and determination.<br />\nSeveral times the team was so disheartened by<br />\nthe loss of some of its good players that it contemplated dropping out of the League.

This spirit<br />\nis not, now, dead; but it is more dormant than<br />\never before. More men than ever before now<br />\nfeel the claims of college stronger than those<br />\nof clique, and are standing in the line with<br />\neach other. We are now called on to make<br />\nthe best possible application of the efforts of<br />\nthese men.<br />\nUnder our present system of athletic government, undergraduates plan programs, and<br />\ngames; make dates for them; collect and pay<br />\nSPRING GAMES.<br />\nmoney for them; and stimulate themselves to<br />\nin them.

The usual athletic events were de- same team, under the same manager is, at<br />\ncided upon. The board laid out the football present, again in straits. The manager, whom<br />\nwe consider to be stirred by the best of intenschedule for next season.<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\ntions, tells us that he is personally in debt for<br />\nthe team. He holds on cheerfully to his<br />\npolicy in the hope that some future rink manager will be stricken with an attack of liberality. We assure him that if any symptoms of it<br />\never show themselves in a rink manager, they<br />\nwill be promptly checked by the rink owners.<br />\nA business man could tell him that he will get<br />\nnothing from such a corporation except by<br />\nsound sense, and diplomatic action. Again,<br />\nour football manager of last fall was advised<br />\nby every sign of the times, and the weather<br />\noffice, on a Wednesday morning that rain<br />\nwould be falling heavily in the afternoon, when<br />\nthe Haverford eleven was scheduled to play<br />\nour's at Maryland Oval. He was advised to<br />\ncancel the game, and save eighty-five dollars,<br />\nguarantee and expenses ; but he did not do so.<br />\nThis game, like the hockey benefit game, was<br />\nplayed. Twenty dollars worth of spectators<br />\nsaw it from the slushy side lines. But our<br />\nmanager was no whit cast down ; for, said he,<br />\n\"We don't lose anything. It's all subscribed.\"<br />\nNever again let us blame ourselves with being<br />\nloath to subscribe ! And yet, in our opinion,<br />\nthis same football manager was the most energetic one that we remember ; and made the<br />\ngamest and happiest fight we ever saw against<br />\nthe most disheartening conditions that a Hopkins manager ever faced. Nearer still, we<br />\nhave seen the tiresome spectacle of our baseball captain juggling for ten dubious days with<br />\nan uncertain man of doubtful recommendation, when a man of known ability had volunteered his services. We might have enjoyed<br />\nthe juggling, had it not shut three of our teams<br />\nout of the cage when the cage was vitally<br />\nnecessary to the improvement of our teams.<br />\nAnd yet we quite agree with those who call<br />\nthis captain the ablest that we remember to<br />\nhave captained a Hopkins ball team. We find<br />\nno fault with these men, and seek to find none.<br />\nWe believe them to be the best Hopkins officials we have known, excepting always the<br />\nlacrosse captain of last year. But such blunders as these have made us bankrupt. We<br />\nmention them to show that the best our undergraduate business men can do is not good<br />\nenough.<br />\nThey are ignorant, second, of athletics.<br />\nThey know nothing of the athletic world and<br /><br />\n7<br /><br />\nits people, and no ideas and methods but their<br />\nown. The list of events for the State games<br />\nto be held May 21 is an excellent example of<br />\nathletic ignorance. This is a garbled copy of<br />\nthe official list of the National meets of the<br />\nNational Intercollegiate Association. It is interminable. The gentlemen who made it no<br />\ndoubt failed to observe that the National Association devotes two days to what they have<br />\nforced the State to do in one afternoon. The<br />\nmeet may not end in the moonlight ; but it<br />\nwill certainly weary many a patient watcher.<br />\nA practical athlete with a knowledge of detail<br />\nnever could have been guilty of such a<br />\nproduct.<br />\nThird, the usual undergraduate is unable,<br />\nalone, to keep a number of men interested in<br />\ntheir work. He lacks that knowledge of men,<br />\nwhich comes with age and experience. We<br />\nknow that the officers of our present lacrosse<br />\nteam have honestly and earnestly done their<br />\nwork, and should be honored for it. But compare the spirit of the team with the spirit of<br />\nthe team of last year, and see what knowledge<br />\nof men and means is worth.<br />\nAnd, moreover, the undergraduate's class<br />\nduties hinder him from giving a proper<br />\namount of attention to his managerial duties.<br />\nAn important letter to be written has before<br />\nnow been laid aside at the ringing of the period<br />\nbell, and forgotten. Many an overworked<br />\nmanager has resigned in favor of a new man,<br />\nand subjected our teams to all the harm that<br />\nthis implies.<br />\nWhenever athletics are a credit to any<br />\nschool these facts have been discovered. It is<br />\ntime they are mentioned here. No successful<br />\nathletic system is anywhere guided by undergraduates. Our's should not be. The present efforts of our undergraduates are hopeless.<br />\nBut they can become a credit to us, and to our<br />\nschool, if directed by knowledge.<br />\nIf any deny these statements, we retract<br />\nthem. We will wax mendacious, and concede<br />\nthat the undergraduates are shrewd business<br />\nmen ; are familiar with athletics in general,<br />\nand in detail ; know each other, and how to<br />\nmove each other ; and have unlimited leisure<br />\nin which to apply their knowledge. Even so,<br />\nthe undergraduate management of today differs from that gone, and from that to come.<br /><br />\n8<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br /><br />\nIt changes from year to year. Under such<br />\nconditions, a fixed policy of management is<br />\nimpossible. And if success is to last more<br />\nthan a day, a fixed policy is imperatively demanded.<br />\nA business man and athlete should direct<br />\nour athletic work just as truly as a business<br />\nman and scholar should direct our scholastic<br />\nwork. He should be consulted, and respectfully consulted, in every matter that in any<br />\nway affects our athletic reputation. His<br />\nknowledge of business should make his decision final in making games with other<br />\nschools, in guarantee terms, in transportation<br />\nof teams, and in all the insignificant details<br />\nwhich are likely to become elephants,<br />\nand swallow up all that has been \"subscribed.\"<br />\nHis knowledge of athletics should make his<br />\nauthority final in the planning of games,<br />\nmeets, and schedules. His knowledge of people would enable him to stimulate the men<br />\nand keep them at the work which his business<br />\nand athletic sense projected. His active supervision should be continuous, not the \"tenminutes-between periods\" spasm of the undergraduate, nor the occasional hour snatched<br />\nfrom a law or medical practice by an industrious, but willing alumnus. It should employ his full time. He should be at the work<br />\nall day, and all night, when necessary. His<br />\nscope of action should be as wide as the field<br />\nto be won. He should be accountable to no<br />\nauthority except the just authority of the faculty ; and should defer to no one except to<br />\nsuch a representative of the faculty as we now<br />\nhave in Dr. Renouf.<br />\nThe employment of such a man with such<br />\npowers would not at all change our present<br />\nsystem of athletic government. On the contrary it would make profitable much hard and<br />\nearnest work now wasted. Such an officer<br />\nwould be an invaluable advisor to the Governing Board of the General Athletic Association.<br />\nHe would be a confidant of managers of teams.<br />\nAnd he would co-operate with coaches to support the authority of captains. Without interfering with the coaches, he could assist them ;<br />\nand the authoritative rebuke of one up to<br />\nwhom they look would be far more effective to<br />\nbacksliding men than the feeble complainings<br /><br />\nof team officials whose desire for popularity<br />\nwill not permit them to be disagreeable.<br />\n\"These statements are but theoretical,\" you<br />\nmay say. We admit it. However, at the<br />\nsame time, the theories are not discoveries.<br />\nThey have been deduced from the success and<br />\nfailure of many places. And our conclusion<br />\nis justified by facts at every point. The University of Chicago, in a few years, is risen from<br />\nan athletic nonenity to be the athletic center of<br />\nthe west. Mr. F. A. Stagg is in charge of its<br />\nathletics, and he wields the powers we have described. In some great eastern colleges,<br />\nmuch of the athletic supervision is in charge of<br />\nalumni ; but these are not one-hour men.<br />\nThey are men who have taken root in their<br />\npositions until they have formed a whole corps<br />\nof such officers as we have described. Pennsylvania has its Faries and Murphy. Yale has<br />\nits Seaver Cook and Camp. Princeton has<br />\nits Goldie Fine. We may never be as great<br />\nin athletics as these ; we are surely not, at<br />\npresent, too important to imitate them.<br />\nThe authority of such a position as we have<br />\noutlined could not be conferred on anyone except by our trustees and faculty, to whom<br />\nthe holder of it would be responsible. But it<br />\nwould be strengthened by the consent of those<br />\nwhom he would direct. We believe that all<br />\nundergraduates will feel the need of putting<br />\nour athletics in the charge of one able to take<br />\ncare of them. And it should be their duty to<br />\nmake our trustees and faculty feel as they<br />\nthemselves do. We have the deepest confidence in the desire of the trustees and faculty<br />\nto do all in their power to advance our athletic<br />\ninterests. We do not call on them to add a<br />\nsecond donation to their generous gift ; but<br />\nask them only to complete it. We ask them<br />\nonly to give us the guide to make the new<br />\nquarters profitable. If we can convince them<br />\nof the justice of our request, two years should<br />\nbring a golden age when \"subscriptions\" will<br />\nno longer be sought, and the Johns Hopkins<br />\nGeneral Athletic Association will pay diviZED MARSHALL BALLARD.<br />\ndends.<br />\nDr. Ira Remsen represented the University<br />\nat the annual banquet of the Johns Hopkins<br />\nAlumni of New York City, given last week.<br /><br />\n1<br /><br />\n-.10191r<br /><br />\nTHE UNIVERSITY SCHOOL F2R BOYS<br />\nW.<br /><br />\nS.
