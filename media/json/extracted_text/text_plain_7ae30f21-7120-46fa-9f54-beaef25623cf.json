There had<br />\nbeen some attempt to establish such<br />\na league during the basket-ball season but on account of the closeness<br />\nof mid-year examinations, the project had to be abandoned. However, at the present time, with the<br />\nfinals nearly three months off, and<br />\nwith the gradual spread of \"spring<br />\nfever,\" the \"great American game\"<br />\nseems just \"to hit the spot.\"<br />\nThe AIechanical Engineers have<br />\nthe edge on their fellow engineers<br />\nin that they have already started<br />\npractice. The Civil Engineers plan<br />\nto begin practice some time this<br />\nweek.<br />\nA definite schedule has not yet<br />\nbeen prepared but a number of students are working on it now and<br />\nare rapidly bringing it into shape.<br />\nDefinite announcements will be<br />\nmade in the very near future.<br />\nInterest in these games promises<br />\nto be very great because of the<br />\ngreat rivalry existing among the<br />\nfour departments of the engineering school. The games will be<br />\nmuch better than the usual amateur performances because there<br />\nare quite a number of men in the<br />\nengineering school W ith prep<br />\nschool records in baseball. These<br />\nmen are unable for lack of time to<br />\ngo out and work earnestly for the<br />\nvarsity squad, but nevertheless<br />\nwill come out and play for the;r<br />\nilep:rtment.<br />\n<br />\nDATE OF MILITARY BALL<br />\nSET FOR APRIL 11<br />\nAnnouncement was made today<br />\nthat the Military Department will<br />\ngive a Military Ball on the evening of April 11, in the Civil En0-ineerinc, Hall.<br />\nThis will be the first attempt to<br />\nstage this type of a dance at Hopkins. Other colleges, usually esmilitary institutions,<br />\nsentially<br />\nmake a practice of holding military balls, it was pointed out, and<br />\nthe Military Department can see<br />\nno reason why such an affair<br />\nshould not be a success at Hopkins.<br />\nA committee, consisting of Wilg,is, chairman, Griffith and Rowland, has been appointed and it<br />\nwill have complete charge of the<br />\naffair.<br />\n\"Further information about the<br />\nball will be forthcoming later,'<br />\nsaid Chairman Wilgis. \"However,<br />\nit will be well for all of the fellows to remember the date, April<br />\n11th, and keep it open if they want<br />\nto be present at a thoroughly enjoyable affair.\" If the ball is a<br />\nsuccess it will be continued in the<br />\nfuture.<br />\n<br />\n-1221-ErnIEEEEPIL1221212121EMJg<br />\n0.
