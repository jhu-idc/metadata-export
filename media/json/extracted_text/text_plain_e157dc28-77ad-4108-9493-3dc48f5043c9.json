Unsurmountable difficulties faced him<br />\nbefore he attained any sort of position at the Hopkins, and then it<br />\nwas only through the grace of<br />\nMaestro John Lusco, tonsorial artist par excellence, that he achieved<br />\nhis worthwhile ambition. And now<br />\nthe University is graced by his<br />\npresence, and is thus represented<br />\nin a previously disregarded sphere<br />\nof scholarly activity.

In connection with<br />\nthis, he quoted a good deal<br />\nfrom the Literary Digest survey of the problem, which leads<br />\nto the conclusion that there is considerably less drinking now among<br />\ncollege men than there was before<br />\nprohibition. The only University<br />\nwhich reported an increase was the<br />\nJohns Hopkins.<br />\nSituation Has Improved<br />\n<br />\nHe also gave statistics from various authoritative sources showing that the situation had improved<br />\nimmensely among the working men<br />\nand young men not attending college.

Hopkins<br />\ndefeated Yale without undue difficulty. The game was won in the<br />\nfirst half. Yale showed a rather strong attack and scored freely during<br />\nthe second half, but never tied the score. The Hopkins defense played<br />\nits poorest game of the season. The Jays certainly played a more difficult schedule, meeting all of the leading teams excepting Navy and<br />\nRutgers and met defeat only once.<br />\nIf the ranking committee are of the opinion that Hopkins won a<br />\nfluke victory from Sr. John's, they are justified in their first two rankings. Personally, we feel that Maryland was the best college eleven<br />\nin the country last year.<br />\n<br />\nDEBATING<br />\n<br />\nT<br />\n<br />\nT IS with pleasure that we note the re-establishment of the Debating<br />\nCouncil. The position held by this body on the Hopkins campus<br />\nis not unique. Debating was recently re-established at Haverford and<br />\nan editorial in the Haverford News says, \"It was to be regretted that<br />\ndebating at Haverford had fallen to an exceedingly low place in the<br />\nlist of extra-curricular activities, but it is readily apparent that with a<br />\nlittle aid from the undergraduate body the forensic art can be restored<br />\nto its proper place in the list of extra-curricular activities.\" The article<br />\nthen comments on the success of the debating team to date and continues, \"The question of whether debating is to continue at Haverford<br />\nresolves itself into one thing. It is a question of whether the student<br />\nbody will get behind the debating team and present a fair-sized crowd<br />\nat the only home debate. Every contest away from home has been<br />\nattended by audiences ranging from one hundred to two hundred and<br />\ntwenty-five people. While Haverford is much smaller the best the<br />\ndebaters should expect, ought to be an audience of from fifty to sixty<br />\npeople. Debating is far too important an extra-curricular activity to<br />\nbe allowed to die again since it has been resurrected.\"<br />\nThe problem at Hopkins is not whether the audience will be sufficient, but whether enough debaters can be found. If good debaters<br />\nare found, the audience will appear. There are certainly enough able<br />\nmen to form a debating team at Hopkins, but there seems to be little<br />\nif any interest. That debating is flourishing in some institutions is<br />\napparent from an editorial in The Targum, Rutgers University student<br />\npublication. This article comments on the fact that seventy-two men<br />\nattended the opening debating meeting, and that there is more interest<br />\nat present than at any time in the past. The only conclusion that we<br />\ncan draw is that Hopkins men hate to strain their mental capacities.<br />\n<br />\nAt Purdue University, the \"Old<br />\nOaken Bucket\" which is the symbol of football rivalry between<br />\nPurdue and Indiana University,<br />\nwas recently recovered after having been missing for about eleven<br />\ndays.

Hopkins<br />\ndefeated Yale without undue difficulty. The game was won in the<br />\nfirst half. Yale showed a rather strong attack and scored freely during<br />\nthe second half, but never tied the score. The Hopkins defense played<br />\nits poorest game of the season. The Jays certainly played a more difficult schedule, meeting all of the leading teams excepting Navy and<br />\nRutgers and met defeat only once.<br />\nIf the ranking committee are of the opinion that Hopkins won a<br />\nfluke victory from Sr. John's, they are justified in their first two rankings. Personally, we feel that Maryland was the best college eleven<br />\nin the country last year.<br /><br />\nDEBATING<br /><br />\nT<br /><br />\nT IS with pleasure that we note the re-establishment of the Debating<br />\nCouncil. The position held by this body on the Hopkins campus<br />\nis not unique. Debating was recently re-established at Haverford and<br />\nan editorial in the Haverford News says, \"It was to be regretted that<br />\ndebating at Haverford had fallen to an exceedingly low place in the<br />\nlist of extra-curricular activities, but it is readily apparent that with a<br />\nlittle aid from the undergraduate body the forensic art can be restored<br />\nto its proper place in the list of extra-curricular activities.\" The article<br />\nthen comments on the success of the debating team to date and continues, \"The question of whether debating is to continue at Haverford<br />\nresolves itself into one thing. It is a question of whether the student<br />\nbody will get behind the debating team and present a fair-sized crowd<br />\nat the only home debate. Every contest away from home has been<br />\nattended by audiences ranging from one hundred to two hundred and<br />\ntwenty-five people. While Haverford is much smaller the best the<br />\ndebaters should expect, ought to be an audience of from fifty to sixty<br />\npeople. Debating is far too important an extra-curricular activity to<br />\nbe allowed to die again since it has been resurrected.\"<br />\nThe problem at Hopkins is not whether the audience will be sufficient, but whether enough debaters can be found. If good debaters<br />\nare found, the audience will appear. There are certainly enough able<br />\nmen to form a debating team at Hopkins, but there seems to be little<br />\nif any interest. That debating is flourishing in some institutions is<br />\napparent from an editorial in The Targum, Rutgers University student<br />\npublication. This article comments on the fact that seventy-two men<br />\nattended the opening debating meeting, and that there is more interest<br />\nat present than at any time in the past. The only conclusion that we<br />\ncan draw is that Hopkins men hate to strain their mental capacities.<br /><br />\nAt Purdue University, the \"Old<br />\nOaken Bucket\" which is the symbol of football rivalry between<br />\nPurdue and Indiana University,<br />\nwas recently recovered after having been missing for about eleven<br />\ndays.
