We can only<br />\nregret that we, as undergraduates,<br />\nwill be unable to experience that<br />\nlife.<br />\nLateness.<br />\n<br />\nHomewood Again.<br />\n<br />\nSome modern sages have remarked that men get more enjoyment in looking forward to a certain<br />\nevent or pleasure than they do in<br />\nthe experiencing of the event or<br />\npleasure itself. Whether this is true<br />\nor not, we who are to be denied the<br />\nenjoyment of the life at Homewood<br />\nmay yet derive some small amount<br />\nof pleasure from looking forward<br />\nto the time when the University will<br />\nchange its quarters, and in talking<br />\nof the many fine things that it is<br />\ngoing to- have when it gets there.<br />\nOne of the advantages that we may<br />\nhope to secure when Homewood becomes a reality is the greater facility<br />\nafforded for social life among the<br />\nstudents themselves. When the<br />\nJohns Hopkins will have its campus<br />\nand quadrangle, its dormitories and<br />\nfrat houses, all grouped together<br />\nat. Homewood in \"the delightful seclusion of this historic estate, with<br />\nits 120 acres of lawn and shade,\"<br />\nthe undergraduate life ought to become broader and mean more to the<br />\nstudent than it can now amid -the<br />\nprosaic sights and the disturbing<br />\nsounds of city streets.\" It should,<br />\ntherefore, be of interest to us all to<br />\nlearn of the plans that are being<br />\nmade, for the social side of college<br />\nlife at Homewood.<br />\nIn the March issue of the Alumni<br />\nMagazine appears an article on \"The<br />\nCollege in the University\" by Dean<br />\nE. H. Griffin, of the college faculty.<br />\nPlans for residence at Homewood<br />\nare there outlined. The halls Of<br />\nresidence that may be erected at<br />\nHomewood will not be like the traditional college dormitory, with \"its<br />\ncommonplace architecture and the<br />\nrough and ready manner of its occupants.\" Our halls are to be \"dignified additions to the group of collegiate buildings, and those who occupy them will observe the same<br />\nrules of decorum that would be ob-<br />\n<br />\n\"For verily, I say unto you, the<br />\nfirst shall be last, and the last shall<br />\nbe first.\"<br />\nIf we were sure that this were<br />\nthe motto of many of the undergraduate students in the University,<br />\nwe would be tempted to believe that<br />\na part, yea, a very large part, of the<br />\nstudents were out trying for the<br />\nRhodes scholarships, Phi Beta<br />\nKappa keys, prizes, honors, etc.<br />\nBut since our common sense tells<br />\nus that no very large part of the<br />\nstudents are trying to become shining stars in the scholarship world,<br />\nwe must seek some other explanation of the state of affairs that has<br />\nled us to believe that perhaps some<br />\nof the students had selected the<br />\nabove quotation as their motto.<br />\nThe reason why we are brought<br />\nto this conclusion must be of itself<br />\napparent to all who attend undergraduate classes. There is hardly<br />\na class from Monday morning until<br />\nFriday afternoon where every one<br />\nis in his seat, or even in the room,<br />\nwhen the hour bell rings. When<br />\nwe try to explain this deplorable<br />\ncondition, we are at a loss to find<br />\nadequate -quid propter\" s. Of course<br />\nwhen we go to the theatre or to<br />\nthe cotillon or to a reception, etc.,<br />\nit is understood that it would be<br />\nhighly improper for us to be on<br />\ntime. But why should this custom<br />\nbe brought into class? When you<br />\ncome tripping in, five, ten, or fifteen<br />\nminutes after the hour, no one is<br />\nbenefited by the fact, every one is<br />\ndisturbed, and you have lost part of.<br />\nthe lecture or recitation. And the<br />\nworst thing about this custom of<br />\nbeing late is the fact that it is largely<br />\ndue to carelessness and indifference.<br />\nYou must finish your cigarette.<br />\nstump, get the mail from your box,<br />\nfinish your conversation, tell another<br />\nstale joke, or wait for the next uncertain trip of the elevator.<br />\n(Continued on page 6, col. 1.)<br />\n<br />\nLEMMERT<br />\n\"READY TO WEAR\" CLOTHES FOR YOUNG MEN<br />\nThe Best Merchant Tailoring Characterizes our \u201cClothes.\"<br />\nAs we make them ourselves, we are constantly adding New<br />\nModels, both in Suits and Overcoats<br />\n<br />\nLEMMERT<br />\n19 EAST FAYETTE STREET<br />\n<br />\nATTENTION!

Before<br />\n\"casting the first stone,\" let me mention what the Board has done toward improving the dances: First,<br />\nthere is a regular receiving committee. As is very proper, all the girls<br />\nand men before entering the roOm<br />\nare introduced to several of the<br />\nchaperons who are on the committee. Much better and more dignified, is it not, than the former practice of never speaking to the chaperons? Second, the music has been<br />\nnotably bettered. While it seemed<br />\na shame to get rid of the old man<br />\nwho has played so long and so faithfully at the University functions,<br />\nwe cannot always sacrifice ourselves<br />\nto sentiment. With \"Lewie\" Fisher<br />\nor one of his right hand men,<br />\n\"ginger\" has come into the dances<br />\nin a truly remarkable way. Third,<br />\nthe number of men coming to the<br />\ndance has been greatly increased.<br />\nThe cotillon is now truly a Univer-<br />\n<br />\nsity affair. And if the members of<br />\nthe Board were present at this writing they could undoubtedly suggest<br />\na fourth or fifth improvement which<br />\nhas been made, but were I to mention them here I should have no<br />\nroom to \"sling my stones.\"<br />\nStone No. L\u2014Although the orchestra had finished the first eight<br />\ndances by ten or quarter past, the<br />\nsecond half of the dances did not<br />\ncommence until eleven o'clock. Why<br />\non Saturday night, when we can<br />\nonly dance until twelve, this lengthy<br />\nhour for refreshments. The writer<br />\ndoes not complain. For him the<br />\ntime passed only too rapidly. He<br />\nis slinging in behalf of the stags and<br />\nthe men who \"didn't bring fairies.\"<br />\nThe cause for this long intermission<br />\nhas been given as the poor arrangements for supper. If so, let the arrangements be bettered.<br />\nStone No. 2\u2014Perhaps it was because the noted \"Lewie\" was performing at the Country Club, and a<br />\nsubstitute was on the job, that one<br />\nhad to clap like the deuce before getting an encore. And perhaps the<br />\nfact that the substitute tired easily<br />\nwas the reason for the long waits<br />\nbetween dances.

The two teams could<br />\nnot have been more evenly matched,<br />\nand at no time during the game was<br />\neither the Black and Blue or the<br />\nBlue and Gold more than one point<br />\nahead.<br />\nThe rival captains agreed upon<br />\n25 and 20 minutes as the time of<br />\nthe halves, but at the close of these<br />\nperiods the score stood a tie at 3<br />\nto 3. Then it was agreed to play<br />\nan extra period of m minutes.<br />\nMainly through the splendid work<br />\nof the two goal tenders, neither<br />\nteam was able to score during this<br />\ntime. Then a second period of the<br />\nsame length was agreed upon, at<br />\nthe end. of which, whatever the<br />\nscore, the game was to stop.

After about seven minutes<br />\nof the second extra stanza, Navy<br />\ngained the lead when Mitchell made<br />\na count. With only three minutes<br />\nremaining, Hopkins, showing brilliant ability to come back, took a<br />\nwonderful brace, and immediately<br />\nevened up the score. The tally was<br />\nmade by LaMotte, who received a<br />\npass from behind the Middies' goal.<br />\nThe balance of the time was full<br />\nof spirited playing, although both<br />\nteams showed the result-of the fast<br />\npace.<br />\nAside from the splendid work of<br />\nthe two goal tenders, which was<br />\neasily the featuresof the game, Huck,<br />\nHollyday, Tappan, and the close attack starred for Hopkins, while<br />\nMitchell, Starkey, Gray and.

The arrangement in regard to the .game for<br />\nTuesday was reached by Manager<br />\nF. W. Hubbell of Harvatd and<br />\nManager C. Leland .Getz of the<br />\nJohns Hopkins team last Saturday<br />\nnight. Both teams are very anxious<br />\nfor the game to be played. If the<br />\nweather is good a very large crowd<br />\nshould turn out for the game, as<br />\nHarvard always proves a big drawing card in Baltimore.<br />\nAlthough prevented by the rainy<br />\nweather of the past few days from<br />\nhaving a practice since the Princeton game, the Black and Blue nine<br />\nis in very good shape. Steady progress has been made since the opening of the season, and the good<br />\nshowing made against Princeton<br />\nlast Wednesday is an evidence of<br />\nwhat the Hopkins team is capable<br />\nof. With Sutton and Porter back<br />\nin the line-up the prospects of<br />\ndefeating Harvard are especially<br />\nbright.

The quotations from Dean<br />\nGriffin's article are enough, of themselves, to give promise of a happy<br />\nlife at Homewood. We can only<br />\nregret that we, as undergraduates,<br />\nwill be unable to experience that<br />\nlife.<br />\nLateness.<br /><br />\nHomewood Again.<br /><br />\nSome modern sages have remarked that men get more enjoyment in looking forward to a certain<br />\nevent or pleasure than they do in<br />\nthe experiencing of the event or<br />\npleasure itself. Whether this is true<br />\nor not, we who are to be denied the<br />\nenjoyment of the life at Homewood<br />\nmay yet derive some small amount<br />\nof pleasure from looking forward<br />\nto the time when the University will<br />\nchange its quarters, and in talking<br />\nof the many fine things that it is<br />\ngoing to- have when it gets there.<br />\nOne of the advantages that we may<br />\nhope to secure when Homewood becomes a reality is the greater facility<br />\nafforded for social life among the<br />\nstudents themselves. When the<br />\nJohns Hopkins will have its campus<br />\nand quadrangle, its dormitories and<br />\nfrat houses, all grouped together<br />\nat.

H. Griffin, of the college faculty.<br />\nPlans for residence at Homewood<br />\nare there outlined. The halls Of<br />\nresidence that may be erected at<br />\nHomewood will not be like the traditional college dormitory, with \"its<br />\ncommonplace architecture and the<br />\nrough and ready manner of its occupants.\" Our halls are to be \"dignified additions to the group of collegiate buildings, and those who occupy them will observe the same<br />\nrules of decorum that would be ob-<br /><br />\n\"For verily, I say unto you, the<br />\nfirst shall be last, and the last shall<br />\nbe first.\"<br />\nIf we were sure that this were<br />\nthe motto of many of the undergraduate students in the University,<br />\nwe would be tempted to believe that<br />\na part, yea, a very large part, of the<br />\nstudents were out trying for the<br />\nRhodes scholarships, Phi Beta<br />\nKappa keys, prizes, honors, etc.<br />\nBut since our common sense tells<br />\nus that no very large part of the<br />\nstudents are trying to become shining stars in the scholarship world,<br />\nwe must seek some other explanation of the state of affairs that has<br />\nled us to believe that perhaps some<br />\nof the students had selected the<br />\nabove quotation as their motto.<br />\nThe reason why we are brought<br />\nto this conclusion must be of itself<br />\napparent to all who attend undergraduate classes. There is hardly<br />\na class from Monday morning until<br />\nFriday afternoon where every one<br />\nis in his seat, or even in the room,<br />\nwhen the hour bell rings. When<br />\nwe try to explain this deplorable<br />\ncondition, we are at a loss to find<br />\nadequate -quid propter\" s. Of course<br />\nwhen we go to the theatre or to<br />\nthe cotillon or to a reception, etc.,<br />\nit is understood that it would be<br />\nhighly improper for us to be on<br />\ntime. But why should this custom<br />\nbe brought into class? When you<br />\ncome tripping in, five, ten, or fifteen<br />\nminutes after the hour, no one is<br />\nbenefited by the fact, every one is<br />\ndisturbed, and you have lost part of.<br />\nthe lecture or recitation. And the<br />\nworst thing about this custom of<br />\nbeing late is the fact that it is largely<br />\ndue to carelessness and indifference.<br />\nYou must finish your cigarette.<br />\nstump, get the mail from your box,<br />\nfinish your conversation, tell another<br />\nstale joke, or wait for the next uncertain trip of the elevator.<br />\n(Continued on page 6, col. 1.)<br /><br />\nLEMMERT<br />\n\"READY TO WEAR\" CLOTHES FOR YOUNG MEN<br />\nThe Best Merchant Tailoring Characterizes our \u201cClothes.\"<br />\nAs we make them ourselves, we are constantly adding New<br />\nModels, both in Suits and Overcoats<br /><br />\nLEMMERT<br />\n19 EAST FAYETTE STREET<br /><br />\nATTENTION!

Before<br />\n\"casting the first stone,\" let me mention what the Board has done toward improving the dances: First,<br />\nthere is a regular receiving committee. As is very proper, all the girls<br />\nand men before entering the roOm<br />\nare introduced to several of the<br />\nchaperons who are on the committee. Much better and more dignified, is it not, than the former practice of never speaking to the chaperons? Second, the music has been<br />\nnotably bettered. While it seemed<br />\na shame to get rid of the old man<br />\nwho has played so long and so faithfully at the University functions,<br />\nwe cannot always sacrifice ourselves<br />\nto sentiment. With \"Lewie\" Fisher<br />\nor one of his right hand men,<br />\n\"ginger\" has come into the dances<br />\nin a truly remarkable way. Third,<br />\nthe number of men coming to the<br />\ndance has been greatly increased.<br />\nThe cotillon is now truly a Univer-<br /><br />\nsity affair. And if the members of<br />\nthe Board were present at this writing they could undoubtedly suggest<br />\na fourth or fifth improvement which<br />\nhas been made, but were I to mention them here I should have no<br />\nroom to \"sling my stones.\"<br />\nStone No. L\u2014Although the orchestra had finished the first eight<br />\ndances by ten or quarter past, the<br />\nsecond half of the dances did not<br />\ncommence until eleven o'clock. Why<br />\non Saturday night, when we can<br />\nonly dance until twelve, this lengthy<br />\nhour for refreshments. The writer<br />\ndoes not complain. For him the<br />\ntime passed only too rapidly. He<br />\nis slinging in behalf of the stags and<br />\nthe men who \"didn't bring fairies.\"<br />\nThe cause for this long intermission<br />\nhas been given as the poor arrangements for supper. If so, let the arrangements be bettered.<br />\nStone No. 2\u2014Perhaps it was because the noted \"Lewie\" was performing at the Country Club, and a<br />\nsubstitute was on the job, that one<br />\nhad to clap like the deuce before getting an encore. And perhaps the<br />\nfact that the substitute tired easily<br />\nwas the reason for the long waits<br />\nbetween dances. To some these<br />\nlong intermissions might not have<br />\nbeen disagreeable maybe the other<br />\nfellows liked to talk more ,than<br />\ndance\u2014in striking juxtaposition to<br />\nmyself.<br /><br />\nTime is fleeting\u2014<br />\nand in that respect it's<br />\njust like money.<br />\nBut it doesn't require much time\u2014nor<br />\nmoney either\u2014to get<br />\na big red tin of<br /><br />\nTHE<br />\n1\u00b0<br />\n70<br />\nsmoomest<br />\nTOEACCO<br /><br />\nPull size<br />\n2-ounce tirtr<br /><br />\nAlso in<br />\nonc<br />\npound<br />\nglass<br />\njars with<br />\nhumidor<br />\ntops.<br /><br />\nAny tobacco sign<br />\npoints the way-10c<br />\nfurnishes the means\u2014<br />\nand the tin opens Up<br />\na good.time.

The two teams could<br />\nnot have been more evenly matched,<br />\nand at no time during the game was<br />\neither the Black and Blue or the<br />\nBlue and Gold more than one point<br />\nahead.<br />\nThe rival captains agreed upon<br />\n25 and 20 minutes as the time of<br />\nthe halves, but at the close of these<br />\nperiods the score stood a tie at 3<br />\nto 3. Then it was agreed to play<br />\nan extra period of m minutes.<br />\nMainly through the splendid work<br />\nof the two goal tenders, neither<br />\nteam was able to score during this<br />\ntime. Then a second period of the<br />\nsame length was agreed upon, at<br />\nthe end. of which, whatever the<br />\nscore, the game was to stop. During this time both teams tallied once.<br />\nHopkins drew first blood, when<br />\nafter about three minutes of play,<br />\nCaptain Johnny Huck made one of<br />\nhis famous drives. The advantage<br />\ndid not last long, however, for,<br />\nwithin a few moments Gray slipped<br />\nthe ball passed Sears for the Navy's<br />\nfirst count. After twelve more minutes of splendid playing on the part<br />\nof both teams, Tappan scored the<br />\nsecond point for the Black and Blue.<br />\nAgain Navy evened up, Gray caging<br />\nthe ball for his second goal, and the<br />\nhalf ended with the score 2 to 2.<br />\nThe Middies began the second<br />\nperiod at a fast clip, and in less than<br />\ntwo minutes Davis succeeded in getting a hard drive into the net. It<br />\nwas not long, however, before Hollyday succeeded in making a shot<br />\nfrom a mix-up in front of the Navy<br />\ngoal. There was no more scoring<br />\nduring this half.<br />\nDuring the first of the extra periods each side had several chances<br />\nto score, but both .showed stalwart<br />\ndefense. After about seven minutes<br />\nof the second extra stanza, Navy<br />\ngained the lead when Mitchell made<br />\na count. With only three minutes<br />\nremaining, Hopkins, showing brilliant ability to come back, took a<br />\nwonderful brace, and immediately<br />\nevened up the score. The tally was<br />\nmade by LaMotte, who received a<br />\npass from behind the Middies' goal.<br />\nThe balance of the time was full<br />\nof spirited playing, although both<br />\nteams showed the result-of the fast<br />\npace.<br />\nAside from the splendid work of<br />\nthe two goal tenders, which was<br />\neasily the featuresof the game, Huck,<br />\nHollyday, Tappan, and the close attack starred for Hopkins, while<br />\nMitchell, Starkey, Gray and.
