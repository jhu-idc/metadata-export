He used the regulation<br />\namount of powder and wadding, but placed the<br />\ngreater part of the charge of powder ahead of the<br />\nshot.

Mulberry St.<br />\nBaltimore, Md.<br /><br />\nTHERE are only two outstanding<br />\ncharacteristics of the honorary fraternities on the Hopkins campus: first, they<br />\nonly appear once a year; and second,<br />\nthat's all. As to their social utility, as it<br />\nwere, on the campus, they rate close to<br />\nnil. 0. D. K. periodically turns over in<br />\nits sleep and mutters something about<br />\n\"ideas\", but if anyone approaches them<br />\nwith one, they immediately address themselves to deeper slumber; Tau Beta Pi<br />\ndoesn't even talk in its sleep; Phi Beta<br />\nKappa is supremely indifferent to anything but its own exclusiveness which<br />\nkeeps it pretty busy, we'll admit; and<br />\nPi Delta Epsilon indulges only in fitful<br />\nstruggles for existence.<br />\nToday we read of the ceremonious annual appearance of two of these groups<br />\nfor the purpose of adding new members.<br />\nAnd new members for what?<br />\nWe suggest that instead of the window-dressing indulged in up to the present, that the fraternities stock up with a<br />\nlittle material accomplishment.

So we halt<br />\nour activity momentarily to laugh right<br />\nout loud at Oxonian naivete.<br />\nResolved: That under no circumstances will we fight for King and Country. But do Union members flatter<br />\nthemselves that the King cares whether<br />\nor not they fight for him if Britain's<br />\nshores are invaded? No, that's not in it<br />\nat all; he can go see a man in Norway<br />\nabout a dog if things get too hot in<br />\nBuckingham. But the ones who will<br />\ncare about a fighting force are the families of the 275 Oxford men who have<br />\npassed this resolution.
