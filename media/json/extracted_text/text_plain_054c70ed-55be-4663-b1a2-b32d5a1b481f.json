The change to $450<br /><br />\nper man has not increased the total<br />\nreceipts from undergraduate tuition<br />\nreceived by the University. Dr. Ames<br />\npointed out that the system of charging extra fees for laboratories (which<br />\nHopkins gave its students before any<br />\nother institution in the country) was<br />\npurely a device for increasing income. The recent change was made<br />\nbecause Dr. Ames considered the fee<br />\nsystem discriminatory and a subterfuge; as far as the University is concerned, all undergraduates have the<br />\nsame privileges and, taken on the<br />\naverage, cost the same.<br />\nIt must be understood, furthermore,<br />\nthat fixed portions of tuitions will no<br />\nlonger be alloted to activities and<br />\nathletics.
