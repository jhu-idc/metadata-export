There is no<br />\nreason why high school biology<br />\nshould be repeated.

Eisenhower.<br />\nPreliminary drawings by the architectural firm of<br />\nMeyer and Ayers have been approved by the trustees. The<br />\ncenter will contain two swimming pools, one of standard<br />\ncollegiate size and a training pool; handball and squash<br />\ncourts; fencing and wrestling rooms; and gymnasium space<br />\nfor basketball, gymnastics, and other indoor sports. The<br />\nbuilding will also contain locker room facilities, meeting<br />\nrooms, classrooms, offices, lounge room, trophy room, and<br />\nareas for casual recreation.<br />\nThe new structure will be built around the present<br />\ngymnasium, which was constructed in 1934. The university<br />\nhas had plans for modernization and expansion of this<br />\nfacility since 1946. The project is one of the major items<br />\nin the ten-year $76,380,000 development program of The<br />\nJohns Hopkins Fund. Construction of the center will start<br />\nin six months.<br />\n\"Final plans and specifications will not he ready for<br />\nsome months,\" Doctor Eisenhower said. \"Gifts and pledges<br />\nmade anonymously assure us that adequate funds will be<br />\navailable by the time construction begins.\"<br />\nThe project will add substantially to the social program of the university, especially for undergraduate<br />\nstudents, President Eisenhower indicated. Floor space on<br />\nthe first floor will be nearly three times the present gymnasium area, and thus will provide ample space for dances<br />\nand other student social affairs. Refreshment facilities will<br />\nhe available, and rooms in the area of the main foyer can<br />\nbe used for non-athletic recreation, meetings, and the like.<br />\nThe gap in the Homewood Field grandstand will he<br />\nfilled in, and rest-room facilities for spectators will be<br />\nbuilt underneath the stands.<br />\n\"Athletic competition, physical education, recreation<br />\nand social activities are essential to any well-rounded collegiate program,\" Doctor Eisenhower said. \"It is gratifying<br />\nto me that we can now go ahead at once with this project.\"<br />\nHe said that the building of the new center does not<br />\nimply any change in traditional Hopkins policies governing<br />\nintercollegiate athletics. The university does not give<br />\nathletic scholarships, charges no admission for its home<br />\ngames, and views athletics as a recreational and educational<br />\nactivity.<br />\nshall continue to follow these policies,\" Doctor<br />\nEisenhower said, \"but with the new facilities we can,<br />\nhappily, provide a fuller program of athletics and physical<br />\neducation for students. I anticipate that we will have a more<br />\nvigorous program of intramural competition. We will be<br />\nable to expand physical education course offerings, and to<br />\nprovide more casual play and recreational opportunities.\"<br />\nDoctor Eisenhower explained that the land for m of<br />\nthe site of the present gymnasium permits excavation underneath to provide locker rooms and other auxiliary<br />\nfacilities, and allows outside light and ventilation for all<br />\ninterior sports rooms. The swimming pools will be in a<br />\nlarge wing on the south, overlooking the present soccer field.<br />\nA new main entrance on the east will lead into a large lounge<br />\narea and foyer, flanked by the trophy room and offices.<br />\n\"I can think of nothing that will give more of a lift<br />\nto the morale of our students than this new facility. it is a<br />\nmatter of key importance to the social and recreational<br />\nwelfare of our undergraduates,\" Doctor Eisenhower concluded.<br />\n<br />\nCeylonese To Dance At Shriver<br />\nThe Ceylon National Dancers, recently called<br />\n\"one of the most brilliantly exotic dance groups<br />\nthat have ever visited this country\" by art-minded<br />\n\u2022<br />\nHorizon magazine, will soon perform at the Johns<br />\nHopkins University.<br />\n\u2022<br />\nThe ornately costumed troupe of seven dancers<br />\nand two drummers will perform their many ritualistic dances in Shriver Hall, Sunday evening, April<br />\n8th at 8:30 p.m. The dancers are on a transcontinental tour and will be presented locally by<br />\nthe Johns Hopkins YMCA and Cosmopolitan Club.<br />\nCeylon dances are regarded as probably the<br />\nmost ancient form of \"theatre\" in the world, going<br />\nback to the nearly extinct Veddahs, the aboriginal<br />\ninhabitants of ancient Ceylon.

The new<br />\nplans are obviously designed to create<br />\ngreater dormitory house spirit, with<br />\nfreshmen vying for admittance into the<br />\nmore favored upperclass houses. Also, the<br />\nproximity of the new athletic and social<br />\ncenter to the dorms, providing far greater<br />\nsocial facilities than the fraternities can,<br />\nwill tend to diminish interest in what the<br />\nGreeks offer.<br />\nCombined with all this, there is a vast<br />\ncomplex of associated problems. Will the<br />\nIFC be able to enforce the new rushing<br />\nsystem? Will the revised system prove<br />\nadequate, or will it contribute to the demise of certain fraternities already beset<br />\nby other difficulties?<br />\nThe IFC and its fraternities are certainly stunned by the news of the new innovations. However, there is little they<br />\ncan do immediately to remedy the situation. We can only wait to see the outcome<br />\nof the new system in operation. It will be<br />\ninteresting to see how the fraternities<br />\nmanage to weather the storm, and how<br />\nmany come out afloat.<br />\n<br />\nThe proposed changes formulated by<br />\nthe Committee on Undergraduate Affairs<br />\nare in one sense very welcome, but in<br />\nanother sense they represent a potential<br />\nthreat to student government on the Hopkins campus.<br />\nThe two basic changes in undergraduate life represent a significant improvement in the concept of freshmen<br />\norientation at Hopkins. For many years<br />\nit has been apparent that the average<br />\nfreshman was not sufficiently prepared<br />\nfor life in the university community. As<br />\na result a needless amount of freshmen<br />\nhad academic difficulties, joined the<br />\nwrong fraternity under the pressure of<br />\nthe old rushing system, or sat in their<br />\nrespective rooms afraid to even eat because of the time it would take from<br />\ntheir study schedule.<br />\nMoreover, these freshmen were in<br />\ndorms that were not organized and designed for either their benefit or the<br />\nbenefit of the upperclassmen.<br />\nIt is for these reasons that we welcome<br />\nthe changes announced by the committee<br />\nthis week.

However, if a man<br />\ncan meet our quality standards and feels that<br />\nhe is really just beginning to learn ... and if he<br />\nis ready to launch his career where learning is<br />\nan important part of the job and where graduate-level training on and off the job is encouraged \u2014 we want and need him.<br />\nAt Western Electric, in addition to the normal learning-while-doing, engineers are encouraged to move ahead in their fields by several types of educational programs. Western<br />\nmaintains its own full-time graduate engineering training program, seven formal management courses, and a tuition refund plan for<br />\nout-of-hours college study.<br />\nThis learning atmosphere is just one reason<br />\nwhy a career at Western Electric is so stimulating.

However, he continued,<br />\nthat sense of justice has now<br />\nbeen incorporated in the Alliance<br />\nfor Progress which. together with<br />\nthe Act of Bogota and the<br />\ncharter of Punte del Este. \"constitute a modern Magna Charta<br />\nof the Americas.\"<br />\nCalling for more mutual understanding among peoples of<br />\nthe hemisphere, Dr. Eisenhower.<br />\nurged the United States public<br />\nto realize that our attitude toward Castro has changed more<br />\nthan many Latin Americans for<br />\n<br />\nwhom social reform is still the<br />\nprimary issue. He stressed that<br />\nthe Alliance was directed at a<br />\nlarger objective than \"Castro's\u2014<br />\nCommunism\", and that the failure of some nations to condemn<br />\nCastro at Punte del Este \"should<br />\nnot deter us from putting the<br />\nfull weight of our faith behind<br />\nthe Alliance for Progress\".<br />\nIn reviewing US-Latin American relations, Dr. Eisenhower<br />\nsaw the United States evolving<br />\nfrom a \"condescending but protective attitude\" through \"expansionism and intervention\" to<br />\nthe Good Neighbor policy and<br />\npresent U.S. aid through regional<br />\ninstitutions.<br />\nFollowing are excerpts from<br />\nDr. Eisenhower's speech:<br />\n\"It is a shocking anachronism<br />\nthat, at the very time the American nations are working for social reforms which would discard historic social stratifications inimical to human dignity,<br />\nan extracontinental conspiratorial force should seek to engulf us with age-old fetters of<br />\nthe omniscient State and omnipotent fate.<br />\nThis coincidence of exalted<br />\nand degraded efforts yields the<br />\nmisleading impression that the<br />\nAlliance for Progress, formulated<br />\nin the Act of Bogota and finalized and proclaimed in the<br />\nCharter of Punta del Este, is<br />\nmerely a negative response of<br />\nfree men to the threat of communist totalitarianism.

It did not<br />\ncause or create them.\"<br />\n\"Expansionism was the driving force of nations at the close<br />\nof the 19th Century. European<br />\npowers were engaged in imperialistic pursuits in Africa, the<br />\nMiddle East, and Asia. Extension<br />\nof this influence into the Western Hemisphere was feared by<br />\nthe United States which was<br />\nemerging as a world power in<br />\nits own right. A profound psychological change occurred. Fostered by political leaders and industrialists, and encouraged by<br />\ncitizens who were charmed by a<br />\nnew sense of power, the United<br />\nStates abandoned a portion of<br />\nits isolationist policy which had<br />\nbeen adhered to since the days<br />\nof Washington. The nation succumbed to imperialism. Eyes<br />\nturned southward toward the<br />\nstrategic Caribbean.<br />\nThe brief struggle to help free<br />\nCuba was the response of decent<br />\npeople against the brutal excesses<br />\nof Spain, but also evident was<br />\nour swaddling ambition for expansion. The imposition of the<br />\nPlatt Amendment and the proclamation of the Roosevelt Corollary to the Monroe Doctrine\u2014<br />\nwhich rationalized our right to<br />\nintervene in hemispheric affairs<br />\n\u2014revealing the degree to which<br />\nthe United States was infected<br />\nwith the global disease of imperialism. Blatant assertions of the<br />\nhegemonic rights of the United<br />\nStates stirred Latin Americans to<br />\na fever of anti-Yankeeism.<br />\nIf. in its long intervention in<br />\nCuba, the United States had fostered the degree of social justice<br />\nwhich it cherished for its own<br />\npeople, the whole course of the<br />\nUnited States-Latin American<br />\nrelations would have been far<br />\ndifferent. The hemisphere need<br />\nnot have been blighted by a Batista or a Castro. A priceless opportunity was missed.\"<br />\n<br />\n\"Present efforts to construct a<br />\nbetter life in freedom in this<br />\nhemisphere are natural and inevitable forward steps in a long<br />\nevolutionary process which would<br />\nhave reached this point of decision even had an egocentric<br />\nCuban leader not betrayed his<br />\npeople by delivering his nation<br />\nto the iron control of the international communist conspiracy.<br />\nCertainly I see the Alliance as a<br />\npositive program of enlightened<br />\n\"Economic and social stratifipeoples to achieve, at last, that cation had been evident from<br />\njustice for all which is sanctified<br />\n(Continued on Page 13)<br />\n<br />\nSc<br />\n<br />\nIT<br />\n<br />\nSV(<br />\n<br />\nkii<br />\n<br />\nCa<br />\n<br />\ntU<br />\nth<br />\njo<br />\nor;<br />\n<br />\nCO<br />\n<br />\nloi<br />\n<br />\nth<br />\n<br />\nyej<br />\n<br />\nle3<br />\n<br />\nme(<br />\nto<br />\n<br />\nPc<br />\n<br />\nOf<br />\nop<br />\n<br />\nha<br />\n<br />\non,<br />\n<br />\nter<br />\n<br />\ntel<br />\n<br />\nkn,<br />\nkir<br />\n<br />\nlov<br />\nalt<br />\nI in<br />\ncm<br />\nbei<br />\n<br />\nevE<br />\nhia<br />\neal<br />\ndek<br />\ntin<br />\ntor<br />\n<br />\nthf<br />\nbe<br />\n<br />\nen]<br />\n<br />\nlal<br />\n<br />\neve<br />\ntur<br />\n<br />\ntw(<br />\ning<br />\nhtn<br />\nvat<br />\n<br />\nabE<br />\nthl<br />\n<br />\nMt.

Let us<br />\nthen leave our provincial world,<br />\nbecome more cosmopolitan, and<br />\nbreak out the same crystal ball<br />\nthat predicted Hopkins would<br />\ndefeat Navy's lacrosse squad and<br />\nthat this year's football team<br />\nwould spend Western Maryland.<br />\nMost obviusly, say the omens<br />\n(and good common sense), the<br />\nYankees will run away with the<br />\nAmerican League pennant. With<br />\nthe Bronx bombers in a class by<br />\nthemselves, the big fight in the<br />\njunior circuit will be for second<br />\nplace between the Baltimore<br />\nOrioles (watch out for the<br />\nswami's partisanship here), the<br />\nDetroit Tigers, the Chicago<br />\nWhite Sox, and the Cleveland<br />\nIndians.<br />\nThe Birds, from exhibition<br />\nperformances, appear to be the<br />\nteam most likely to succeed behind the Yankees. The pitching<br />\nand fielding of the club will again<br />\nbe more than adequate; the real<br />\ncrucial area will be hitting. The<br />\nTigers will suffer from a lack of<br />\nsustained good pitching and the<br />\nsophomore jinx which will hinder<br />\nSteve Boros and Jake Wood. The<br />\ngo-go Sox have gone over the<br />\nhill; and with a total lack of long<br />\nball potential and one of the<br />\nshakiest pitching staffs in the<br />\n<br />\nWeek's Schedule<br />\nApril<br />\n<br />\nBASEBALL<br />\nVarsity<br />\n7\u2014Randolph-Macon--<br />\n<br />\nAway<br />\nApril 10\u2014Towson-3:00 P.M.<br />\nApril 12\u2014Gettysburg\u2014Away<br />\nFreshman<br />\nApril 11\u2014Glen Burnie H.

After the<br />\nintermission, however, a rejuvenated Jay squad, aided by some<br />\npoor play on the part of third<br />\nstring Mount Washington goalie<br />\nHerb Moore, scored 5 goals on 6<br />\nshots. The only difficulty in this<br />\nwas that by this time, the Wolfpack had taken command of<br />\nthings to the tune of a 15-5 lead,<br />\nand this great resurgence scared<br />\nthem a little, but did not contribute greatly to the Jays' by<br />\nthis time nonexistent chances of<br />\na come-from-behind victory. The<br />\nscore now 15-11, both teams<br />\nswapped goals, and the final<br />\nscore was 16-12. Although these<br />\ntotals represented the highest<br />\nscores ever achieved by either<br />\nteam, the cold fact remains that<br />\nthe Jays have not defeated the<br />\nMounties since 1941.<br />\nJays Overcome Nervousness<br />\nAs coach Bob Scott remarked<br />\nin the locker room after the<br />\ngame, the team seemed to be<br />\nsuffering from a first game nervousness in the first half. This,<br />\ncoupled with the fact that the<br />\n<br />\nThe Jays, hoping to recoup this<br />\ndefeat, entered the Yale game<br />\nfull of high spirit. They were a<br />\nbit sluggish in the first quarter,<br />\nhowever, taking 5 minutes to<br />\nscore a goal. About a minute<br />\nlater, Yale tied the score at 1-1,<br />\nbut the Jays, led by Henry Ciccarone, who wound up with 2<br />\ngoals and 6 assists, Jerry<br />\nSchmidt, who finished with 5<br />\ngoals and a single assist, and<br />\nHomer Schwartz, who had 3 of<br />\neach, brought the score to 3-1<br />\nat the quarter.<br />\n<br />\nJERRY SCHMIDT<br />\nscored five goals against Yale<br />\nWolfpack currently has its best<br />\nteam in years, led to the atrocious half-time score. The fact that<br />\nthe Jays outscored the Mounties<br />\nbY a count of 9-4 in the second<br />\nhalf, appeared significant. Henry<br />\nCiccarone and Jerry Schmidt,<br />\nwho combined for a total of 5<br />\ngoals and as many assists, led<br />\nthe Jay attack. Another significant factor was that even when<br />\nthe Mounts' first string returned<br />\nto the game after the Jays had<br />\ntheir binge, they were hard<br />\npressed to hold the surging club,<br />\nand played evenly or worse<br />\nthroughout the remainder of the<br />\ngame. Especially telling were the<br />\nface-offs which Hopkins sophomore Lauren Scheffenacker, and<br />\nMount Washington midfielder Al<br />\nSievold split about equally.<br />\n<br />\nYale did not lose too much<br />\ntime in making the score 3-2<br />\nat the beginning of the second<br />\nstanza. At this point, however,<br />\nthey crawled into a corner and<br />\ndied very quietly as the JaYs<br />\nwent on to gain a 7-2 halftime<br />\nadvantage. Yale, after the half,<br />\ntried valiantly to bring the score<br />\ndown to something respectable.<br />\nThey brought it down to 7-4 and<br />\neventually to 8-5 before the JaYs<br />\nran away, getting the score LIP<br />\nto 15-6 before Yale scored a<br />\nlast ditch goal, after everything<br />\nhad been upset by a succession<br />\nof rains, which drove much of a<br />\nfine crowd to quick cover.

There is no<br />\nreason why high school biology<br />\nshould be repeated.

Dr.<br />\nMcElroy emphasized that the research requirement has been<br />\ndropped for departmental majors<br />\nand that the senior course is<br />\ndesigned to integrate all previous<br />\nknowledge in biology for seniors. This course will not have<br />\na lab. \"We hope that with more<br />\ntime in the senior year, students<br />\nwill want to do their own research,\" Dr. McElroy said.<br />\nThose students who must take<br />\ncourses in biology to fulfill their<br />\nrequirements for medical school<br />\nwill take two of any five of the<br />\nadvanced courses.<br />\nProgression Reversed<br />\nThe new program is exactly<br />\nreverse from the old.

Eisenhower.<br />\nPreliminary drawings by the architectural firm of<br />\nMeyer and Ayers have been approved by the trustees. The<br />\ncenter will contain two swimming pools, one of standard<br />\ncollegiate size and a training pool; handball and squash<br />\ncourts; fencing and wrestling rooms; and gymnasium space<br />\nfor basketball, gymnastics, and other indoor sports. The<br />\nbuilding will also contain locker room facilities, meeting<br />\nrooms, classrooms, offices, lounge room, trophy room, and<br />\nareas for casual recreation.<br />\nThe new structure will be built around the present<br />\ngymnasium, which was constructed in 1934. The university<br />\nhas had plans for modernization and expansion of this<br />\nfacility since 1946. The project is one of the major items<br />\nin the ten-year $76,380,000 development program of The<br />\nJohns Hopkins Fund. Construction of the center will start<br />\nin six months.<br />\n\"Final plans and specifications will not he ready for<br />\nsome months,\" Doctor Eisenhower said. \"Gifts and pledges<br />\nmade anonymously assure us that adequate funds will be<br />\navailable by the time construction begins.\"<br />\nThe project will add substantially to the social program of the university, especially for undergraduate<br />\nstudents, President Eisenhower indicated. Floor space on<br />\nthe first floor will be nearly three times the present gymnasium area, and thus will provide ample space for dances<br />\nand other student social affairs. Refreshment facilities will<br />\nhe available, and rooms in the area of the main foyer can<br />\nbe used for non-athletic recreation, meetings, and the like.<br />\nThe gap in the Homewood Field grandstand will he<br />\nfilled in, and rest-room facilities for spectators will be<br />\nbuilt underneath the stands.<br />\n\"Athletic competition, physical education, recreation<br />\nand social activities are essential to any well-rounded collegiate program,\" Doctor Eisenhower said. \"It is gratifying<br />\nto me that we can now go ahead at once with this project.\"<br />\nHe said that the building of the new center does not<br />\nimply any change in traditional Hopkins policies governing<br />\nintercollegiate athletics. The university does not give<br />\nathletic scholarships, charges no admission for its home<br />\ngames, and views athletics as a recreational and educational<br />\nactivity.<br />\nshall continue to follow these policies,\" Doctor<br />\nEisenhower said, \"but with the new facilities we can,<br />\nhappily, provide a fuller program of athletics and physical<br />\neducation for students. I anticipate that we will have a more<br />\nvigorous program of intramural competition.

The new<br />\nplans are obviously designed to create<br />\ngreater dormitory house spirit, with<br />\nfreshmen vying for admittance into the<br />\nmore favored upperclass houses.

However, there is little they<br />\ncan do immediately to remedy the situation. We can only wait to see the outcome<br />\nof the new system in operation.

European<br />\npowers were engaged in imperialistic pursuits in Africa, the<br />\nMiddle East, and Asia. Extension<br />\nof this influence into the Western Hemisphere was feared by<br />\nthe United States which was<br />\nemerging as a world power in<br />\nits own right. A profound psychological change occurred. Fostered by political leaders and industrialists, and encouraged by<br />\ncitizens who were charmed by a<br />\nnew sense of power, the United<br />\nStates abandoned a portion of<br />\nits isolationist policy which had<br />\nbeen adhered to since the days<br />\nof Washington. The nation succumbed to imperialism. Eyes<br />\nturned southward toward the<br />\nstrategic Caribbean.<br />\nThe brief struggle to help free<br />\nCuba was the response of decent<br />\npeople against the brutal excesses<br />\nof Spain, but also evident was<br />\nour swaddling ambition for expansion.

Blatant assertions of the<br />\nhegemonic rights of the United<br />\nStates stirred Latin Americans to<br />\na fever of anti-Yankeeism.<br />\nIf. in its long intervention in<br />\nCuba, the United States had fostered the degree of social justice<br />\nwhich it cherished for its own<br />\npeople, the whole course of the<br />\nUnited States-Latin American<br />\nrelations would have been far<br />\ndifferent.

A priceless opportunity was missed.\"<br /><br />\n\"Present efforts to construct a<br />\nbetter life in freedom in this<br />\nhemisphere are natural and inevitable forward steps in a long<br />\nevolutionary process which would<br />\nhave reached this point of decision even had an egocentric<br />\nCuban leader not betrayed his<br />\npeople by delivering his nation<br />\nto the iron control of the international communist conspiracy.<br />\nCertainly I see the Alliance as a<br />\npositive program of enlightened<br />\n\"Economic and social stratifipeoples to achieve, at last, that cation had been evident from<br />\njustice for all which is sanctified<br />\n(Continued on Page 13)<br /><br />\nSc<br /><br />\nIT<br /><br />\nSV(<br /><br />\nkii<br /><br />\nCa<br /><br />\ntU<br />\nth<br />\njo<br />\nor;<br /><br />\nCO<br /><br />\nloi<br /><br />\nth<br /><br />\nyej<br /><br />\nle3<br /><br />\nme(<br />\nto<br /><br />\nPc<br /><br />\nOf<br />\nop<br /><br />\nha<br /><br />\non,<br /><br />\nter<br /><br />\ntel<br /><br />\nkn,<br />\nkir<br /><br />\nlov<br />\nalt<br />\nI in<br />\ncm<br />\nbei<br /><br />\nevE<br />\nhia<br />\neal<br />\ndek<br />\ntin<br />\ntor<br /><br />\nthf<br />\nbe<br /><br />\nen]<br /><br />\nlal<br /><br />\neve<br />\ntur<br /><br />\ntw(<br />\ning<br />\nhtn<br />\nvat<br /><br />\nabE<br />\nthl<br /><br />\nMt.

The pitching<br />\nand fielding of the club will again<br />\nbe more than adequate; the real<br />\ncrucial area will be hitting.

After the<br />\nintermission, however, a rejuvenated Jay squad, aided by some<br />\npoor play on the part of third<br />\nstring Mount Washington goalie<br />\nHerb Moore, scored 5 goals on 6<br />\nshots. The only difficulty in this<br />\nwas that by this time, the Wolfpack had taken command of<br />\nthings to the tune of a 15-5 lead,<br />\nand this great resurgence scared<br />\nthem a little, but did not contribute greatly to the Jays' by<br />\nthis time nonexistent chances of<br />\na come-from-behind victory. The<br />\nscore now 15-11, both teams<br />\nswapped goals, and the final<br />\nscore was 16-12. Although these<br />\ntotals represented the highest<br />\nscores ever achieved by either<br />\nteam, the cold fact remains that<br />\nthe Jays have not defeated the<br />\nMounties since 1941.<br />\nJays Overcome Nervousness<br />\nAs coach Bob Scott remarked<br />\nin the locker room after the<br />\ngame, the team seemed to be<br />\nsuffering from a first game nervousness in the first half.

They were a<br />\nbit sluggish in the first quarter,<br />\nhowever, taking 5 minutes to<br />\nscore a goal. About a minute<br />\nlater, Yale tied the score at 1-1,<br />\nbut the Jays, led by Henry Ciccarone, who wound up with 2<br />\ngoals and 6 assists, Jerry<br />\nSchmidt, who finished with 5<br />\ngoals and a single assist, and<br />\nHomer Schwartz, who had 3 of<br />\neach, brought the score to 3-1<br />\nat the quarter.<br /><br />\nJERRY SCHMIDT<br />\nscored five goals against Yale<br />\nWolfpack currently has its best<br />\nteam in years, led to the atrocious half-time score. The fact that<br />\nthe Jays outscored the Mounties<br />\nbY a count of 9-4 in the second<br />\nhalf, appeared significant. Henry<br />\nCiccarone and Jerry Schmidt,<br />\nwho combined for a total of 5<br />\ngoals and as many assists, led<br />\nthe Jay attack. Another significant factor was that even when<br />\nthe Mounts' first string returned<br />\nto the game after the Jays had<br />\ntheir binge, they were hard<br />\npressed to hold the surging club,<br />\nand played evenly or worse<br />\nthroughout the remainder of the<br />\ngame. Especially telling were the<br />\nface-offs which Hopkins sophomore Lauren Scheffenacker, and<br />\nMount Washington midfielder Al<br />\nSievold split about equally.<br /><br />\nYale did not lose too much<br />\ntime in making the score 3-2<br />\nat the beginning of the second<br />\nstanza. At this point, however,<br />\nthey crawled into a corner and<br />\ndied very quietly as the JaYs<br />\nwent on to gain a 7-2 halftime<br />\nadvantage.
