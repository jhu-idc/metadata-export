But at the<br />\nsame time, Wayne Morse is one<br />\nof the most knowledgable men<br />\nin the realm of international affairs in the United States. He<br />\nWas a respected professor of international law before he turned<br />\nto the Senate, and he has been<br />\non The Senate Foreign Relations<br />\nCommittee throughout most of<br />\nhis career. Thus he is someone<br />\nWhose opinions are worth hearing, he deserves a wider audience<br />\nthan the American press has<br />\nthus far accorded him.

Is he responding to internal political pressure, if so from<br />\nwhom?<br />\nAnswer: No, I wouldn't think<br />\nof it in that way. I feel that there<br />\nis certainly a large group of what<br />\nWalter Lippman refers to as<br />\n\"war hawks\" in Washington, and<br />\nthese people have a substantial<br />\nfollowing in the general population. But I think too that most<br />\nof the people who are followers<br />\nof the \"war hawks\" are included<br />\nin that 27 million votes that went<br />\nto Barry Goldwater rather than<br />\nthe 40 million that went to Lyndon Johnson.<br />\nI think that Johnson's mandate in the field of foreign affairs was based on his statements<br />\nthat \"Jaw-Jaw-Jaw is better<br />\nthan war-war-war\", or his oft<br />\nrepeated remarks on the subject<br />\nof \"peace-peace-peace.\" I think<br />\nit would be difficult to interpret<br />\nhis election as a mandate for<br />\nWhat he is doing now.<br />\n<br />\nSEN.

MORSE<br />\n<br />\nMORSE<br />\nDemocratic Senator Wayne<br />\nMorse of Oregon will speak at.<br />\nHopkins on foreign relations<br />\nnext Tuesday at four p.m. in<br />\nShaver Hall.<br />\nA staunch critic of President<br />\nJohnson's policy in South Viet<br />\nNam, Morse has been instrumental in opposing the administration's handling of the problem. As leader of a small group<br />\nat senators in disagreement with<br />\nthe administration, he has repeatedly called for a negotiated<br />\nsettlement to end the war in<br />\nViet Nam.<br />\n<br />\nAnswer: I think we are in<br />\ntrouble in Asia. It feel that it<br />\nis partly a racial factor and<br />\npartly a political one.

Although<br />\nslightly less spectacular, the article seems to forecast the end<br />\nof American society as we know<br />\nit, as surely as the feared fall<br />\nof the airbase at Da Nang.

Hillis Miller of the Department of English, Robert<br />\nCreeley gave a reading from For<br />\nLove: Poems 1950-1960, which<br />\ncollects his previous seven books<br />\nof verse; and also read the fifth<br />\nchapter of The Island, which is<br />\nMr. Creeley's first novel. Charles<br />\nScribner's Sons has published<br />\nboth of these books and has also<br />\nre-collected his short stories,<br />\nThe Gold Diggers, which is to<br />\nbe issued this fall. Mr. Creeley<br />\nhas been awarded a Guggenheim<br />\nfellowship for this year, and is<br />\npresently on leave from the University of New Mexico where he<br />\nis poet-in-residence.<br />\nAt this point, I must, hopefully, intrude upon this cold<br />\nlisting. A formal or impartial<br />\ncontext is foreign to me where<br />\nRobert Creeley's work is the concern. I mean, it is certainly<br />\nrelevant to know of his association with Black Mountain College, and the Black Mountain<br />\nReview which he edited there<br />\nin the early fifties. His coherences with William Carlos Williams, Charles Olsen, Robert<br />\nDuncan, etc. are relevant equally. This type of discussion however, leads one to an endless<br />\nmentioning (e.g., E.P., divers<br />\npress(s), poets, verses, re-verses,<br />\netc., and addenda). The point is<br />\nthat all of the poets that could<br />\nbe mentioned in relation to<br />\nCreeley are, as he is, too important to be left here with a<br />\ndropped name.<br />\nThere is a temptation in me<br />\nto quote as much of Creeley as<br />\nI can possibly manage in the<br />\nsmall space given to me. This is<br />\nby no means an attempt to beg<br />\nthe issue; but rather, to put over<br />\nthe man and the force of his<br />\nheart his writings), rather than<br />\nwords. Anyone who \"hears\"<br />\n<br />\npoetry (so to speak) has felt the<br />\nfull weight of himself running<br />\ninto himself in the poem. Any<br />\none who has been held as surely<br />\nas I have by Robert Creeley's<br />\nwork will understand. Poems<br />\nhave a way of \"seeing to you\"<br />\nand any reaction is seriously<br />\npainful.<br />\n<br />\nthe forms which they assume.<br />\nThat is, one doesn't give a damn<br />\nabout Robert Creeley as the \"I\"<br />\nin this sense but only as this<br />\n\"I\" gives \"me\" some room.<br />\n<br />\nJohn, who is the main concern<br />\nof and with the Island says in<br />\nthe chapter from which Mr.<br />\nIn the preface of The Island Creeley read:<br />\nCreeley says:<br />\n\". ..

But at the<br />\nsame time, Wayne Morse is one<br />\nof the most knowledgable men<br />\nin the realm of international affairs in the United States.

I feel that there<br />\nis certainly a large group of what<br />\nWalter Lippman refers to as<br />\n\"war hawks\" in Washington, and<br />\nthese people have a substantial<br />\nfollowing in the general population. But I think too that most<br />\nof the people who are followers<br />\nof the \"war hawks\" are included<br />\nin that 27 million votes that went<br />\nto Barry Goldwater rather than<br />\nthe 40 million that went to Lyndon Johnson.<br />\nI think that Johnson's mandate in the field of foreign affairs was based on his statements<br />\nthat \"Jaw-Jaw-Jaw is better<br />\nthan war-war-war\", or his oft<br />\nrepeated remarks on the subject<br />\nof \"peace-peace-peace.\" I think<br />\nit would be difficult to interpret<br />\nhis election as a mandate for<br />\nWhat he is doing now.<br /><br />\nSEN.

Hillis Miller of the Department of English, Robert<br />\nCreeley gave a reading from For<br />\nLove: Poems 1950-1960, which<br />\ncollects his previous seven books<br />\nof verse; and also read the fifth<br />\nchapter of The Island, which is<br />\nMr. Creeley's first novel. Charles<br />\nScribner's Sons has published<br />\nboth of these books and has also<br />\nre-collected his short stories,<br />\nThe Gold Diggers, which is to<br />\nbe issued this fall. Mr. Creeley<br />\nhas been awarded a Guggenheim<br />\nfellowship for this year, and is<br />\npresently on leave from the University of New Mexico where he<br />\nis poet-in-residence.<br />\nAt this point, I must, hopefully, intrude upon this cold<br />\nlisting. A formal or impartial<br />\ncontext is foreign to me where<br />\nRobert Creeley's work is the concern. I mean, it is certainly<br />\nrelevant to know of his association with Black Mountain College, and the Black Mountain<br />\nReview which he edited there<br />\nin the early fifties. His coherences with William Carlos Williams, Charles Olsen, Robert<br />\nDuncan, etc. are relevant equally. This type of discussion however, leads one to an endless<br />\nmentioning (e.g., E.P., divers<br />\npress(s), poets, verses, re-verses,<br />\netc., and addenda). The point is<br />\nthat all of the poets that could<br />\nbe mentioned in relation to<br />\nCreeley are, as he is, too important to be left here with a<br />\ndropped name.<br />\nThere is a temptation in me<br />\nto quote as much of Creeley as<br />\nI can possibly manage in the<br />\nsmall space given to me. This is<br />\nby no means an attempt to beg<br />\nthe issue; but rather, to put over<br />\nthe man and the force of his<br />\nheart his writings), rather than<br />\nwords. Anyone who \"hears\"<br /><br />\npoetry (so to speak) has felt the<br />\nfull weight of himself running<br />\ninto himself in the poem.
