Hollis, Stuart Seidel<br />\nAndrew Green<br />\nJay Lenrow<br />\nRussell Lemle<br />\n<br />\nWasted Summer<br />\nA summer and $26,000 later, the Committee on<br />\nGovernance has given us more of the same. Its highlytouted innovation is a 19-member council to advise Dean<br />\nBenton. The Student Council will still assume its<br />\nfigurehead role. The Academic Council and faculty will<br />\nstill exclusively determine all course offerings, faculty<br />\npromotion and tenure. And the administration will still<br />\nexercise final say on everything.<br />\nOther significant changes recommended by the<br />\nGovernance Committee include another new committee, Committee on Instruction, charged to advise the<br />\nfaculty and administration on curriculum. At least 1 of<br />\nthe 8 members will be an undergraduate.<br />\nThe Student Affairs Committee will be abolished<br />\n(maybe it was too defiant for administration tastes last<br />\nyear), the General Assembly Steering Committee will<br />\nbe enlarged from 3 to 5 professors and a free-swinging<br />\nombudsman will help those in need. These minor<br />\nalterations the Governance Committee absurdly bills as<br />\n\"a new system of governance.\"<br />\nTheir 60-page report contained fancy verbiage<br />\n(\"accountability,\" \"clarified lines,\" \"new channels\")<br />\nand little substantive thought or work. It consulted 5<br />\nundergraduates during the summer for its \"imput,\" and<br />\nits meetings were closed to anyone else. But, of course,<br />\nyou could always write a letter to the committee.<br />\nTwo of the 3 undergraduates on the summer Governance Committee refused to sign the report citing its<br />\nstudent tokenism. Maybe that is its greatest indictment<br />\nsince these students (by no means \"radicals\") know<br />\nwhat the Committee left unsaid in its final draft.<br />\n<br />\nStudent Patronization<br />\nYou get what you pay for, goes the old saying. But<br />\nmost everyone has been fleeced at least once in life and<br />\nknows old sayings are not always true.<br />\nAll we're asking you to do is just think about it. Think<br />\nabout what $2500 per year means. Think of what $3,000<br />\nper year means. Here it's called tuition. About onethird of the people in this country live on that for a year.<br />\nBut that's an aside.<br />\nThe real heart of the matter is this: You're being<br />\ncharged for services rendered, or at least made<br />\navailable to you as a student. But what of the services<br />\nnot rendered?<br />\nThe long talked about student union--next year, we<br />\nhear for the umpteenth time.<br />\nParking facilities--well, you students will have to wait<br />\nyour turn behind the administration building.<br />\nBut be patient. You are paying now so that future<br />\ngenerations will have the opportunities you missed.<br />\nJust remember one thing. Your interests are only shortterm and no one expects you to make or participate in<br />\nthe making of long-range plans for the University.<br />\nThat's the job of long-range planners. You pay them to<br />\nplan.<br />\nThe decision to raise tuition was a shocker to us. When<br />\nthe present junior class came to Hopkins, the catalogue<br />\nsaid tuition was $2,000. Now,it is $2,500. Reliable sources<br />\nreport that class will be paying $2,750 next year.<br />\n...And please...don't get mad.<br />\n<br />\nAn Honorable Code?<br />\nBy CHRIS OHLY<br />\nThe aim of \"liberal democracy\" is the<br />\nguarantee to all societal members of certain<br />\ninalienable rights, among these the right of<br />\nself determination and<br />\nthe right of<br />\nprotection from arbitrary rule.<br />\nThe espoused aims of the Gordon-Benton<br />\nconduct code are as noble. The conduct code<br />\nproclaims a \"traditional dependence on self<br />\ndiscipline\" based upon \"rational inquiry and<br />\ndialogue\" that is the mark of an \"association<br />\nof scholars.\" We are told that the code, in its<br />\nformulation and application, must be<br />\n\"mindful of the interests and rights of its<br />\nmembers, must uphold the right of free<br />\nspeech, and must not betray its humane<br />\ntradition.\"<br />\nBut this noble rhetoric is fraudulent, and<br />\nbetrays the hypocrisy of the Gordon-Benton<br />\nadministration.<br />\nPunitive Code<br />\nAfter nearly eighteen months' debate over<br />\nthe institution of a judicial mechanism and<br />\ncode of conduct, designed mainly to protect<br />\nthe student from arbitrary administrative<br />\ndecisions of punitive nature, \"rational<br />\ninquiry and dialogue\" has been abandoned<br />\nby the administration.<br />\nWith the promulgation of the GordonBenton code on September 1, the administration has made clear its intention to<br />\nignore the fruits of debate in representative<br />\ninstitutions. After the ad-hoc committee's<br />\nreport on conduct of May 29, 1969 (an ad-hoc<br />\ncommittee appointed by the President), and<br />\nafter more debate in the Student Affairs<br />\nCommittee,from September 1969 to January<br />\n1970, and even after the President's carefully<br />\nthought out modifications of March 31, we<br />\nstill are faced with a new code.<br />\nThis code, is \"based on a special report ...<br />\nfrom the Committee on Governance,\" (It is<br />\ninteresting to note that only one of three<br />\nundergraduate members of that Committee<br />\nhas signed his name to that document.)<br />\nThis code was prepared by the Dean,<br />\nhowever, and seemingly, given to the<br />\nCommittee on Governance for its stamp of<br />\napproval. There is no more inquiry or<br />\ndialogue. Only the words of the Dean.<br />\nThe words of the Dean, are indeed, clearly<br />\noriented towards ensuring the University's<br />\n\"integrity as a social institution,\" rather<br />\nthan protecting the \"interests and rights of<br />\nits members,\" It is curious that every one of<br />\nthe listed \"obvious forms of misconduct\" is<br />\ndesigned to protect either University<br />\nfacilities, or its \"effective functioning.\"<br />\nIt is also curious that each of these items<br />\ncould be taken as a negation of some activity<br />\ntaken by some members of this \"association<br />\nof scholars\" in last year's disturbances.<br />\nDoes the University uphold its \"humane<br />\ntradition\" by implementing a code that<br />\nvalues property more than it values the<br />\nrights of its members? The University is not<br />\nthe buildings that make up the campus. It is<br />\nnot even the work that goes on within those<br />\nbuildings.<br />\nProtect People<br />\nThe University is the people who live<br />\ntogether in those buildings. Thus to preserve<br />\nits \"integrity as a social institution\" the<br />\nadministration should think of protecting<br />\npeople and not bricks and boards ... lest<br />\nthose bricks and boards become used by<br />\npeople to secure protection.<br />\n<br />\nIt should think of protecting the \"interests<br />\nand rights\" of individuals and not institutions ... lest those individuals abandon<br />\nold, repressive institutions for ones created<br />\nby themselves which serve their individual<br />\ninterests, rather than self-serving institutional ones. These are by no means<br />\nmeant to be threatening statements, merely<br />\ngeneral observations.<br />\nRepression breeds violence, whether that<br />\nrepression is administered on a nationwide<br />\nscale (as by the Nixon-Agnew-Mitchell<br />\nadministration in Washington), or by private<br />\ninstitutions.<br />\nAdministration Hypocrisy<br />\nI suggest that the University's administration is hypocritical when it claims to<br />\nbe \"liberal democratic\" in its orientation,<br />\nand denies the right of self-discipline and<br />\nself-rule to students. I suggest that it is<br />\nhypocritical when it makes this claim, and<br />\ndenies the fruits of its representative institutions' rational inquiry.<br />\nIt is hypocritical when it claims a<br />\n\"humane tradition\" and a desire to \"uphold<br />\nfree speech,\" and then denies \"the<br />\nunauthorized use of sound amplification<br />\nequipment,\" or \"holding demonstrations<br />\nwhich disrupt regular or essential\" activity,<br />\nwithout defining what regular or essential<br />\nactivity is.<br />\nIt is hypocritical when it claims to protect<br />\nthe student from arbitrariness of administration, and then gives itself special<br />\nemergency powers in which the Dean can<br />\ninvoke immediate penalties, call in civil<br />\nauthority, or \"use other suitable procedures<br />\nas the situation requires,\" when the Dean<br />\ndecides that an emergency situation exists.<br />\nStudents can do little about hypocrisy as<br />\nsuch ... at least now. We can do little now but<br />\ntreat such situations as isolated aberrations,<br />\nthough we may see them as endemic in<br />\nUniversity policy. What then can we as<br />\nstudents do to encourage this private institution to recognize our rights? Private<br />\ninstitutions legally are not bound to give due<br />\nprocess, and except for vagarity, the code<br />\nitself is legally a satisfactory document.<br />\nUnsatisfactory<br />\nNonetheless, it remains unsatisfactory to<br />\nstudents, because it fails to recognize our<br />\nInfringement upon<br />\nfundemental rights.<br />\nthose rights is dangerous not only because of<br />\nour immediate concern, but because it<br />\nmakes the University as an institution<br />\ncomplicit with, and non-neutral with regard<br />\nto, the repression of rights and just protest<br />\nnow beginning to appear in the larger<br />\nsociety.<br />\nThe application of incrementally increasing pressure on the administration,<br />\nseems for the time being, our only recourse.<br />\nWe must organize ourselves, and elicit<br />\nsupport from all members of the community<br />\nwho share in our outrage. We should<br />\nfamiliarize ourselves with all the issues<br />\ninvolved, to be able to engage in the<br />\n\"rational inquiry and dialogue\" that the<br />\nUniversity administration claims as our<br />\ntradition.<br />\nAnd if the administration continues in<br />\nstubbornness to abandon that method, we<br />\ncan only look forward to further, expanded<br />\nstrife within the University.<br />\nChris Ohly is a member of the Student Council<br />\n<br />\nLetters to the Editors<br />\nDISTRESSED<br />\nTo the Editors:<br />\nI was distressed by Art<br />\non<br />\nattack<br />\nLevine's<br />\nCongressman Sam Friedel.<br />\nIt was racist (Friedel is an<br />\n\"aging Jew\"), insinuating<br />\n(\"many of his teeth are<br />\nknocked out, perhaps in<br />\n<br />\nclubhouse fights long past\"),<br />\nsnide (Friedel says \"de\"<br />\ninstead of \"the\"), and finally,<br />\n(Friedel has a<br />\nbaseless<br />\n\"pitiful grasp of issues,\"<br />\nalthough he voted against<br />\nABM, for education, etc.)<br />\nI agree with Levine that<br />\nParren Mitchell would make<br />\n<br />\na better Congressman than<br />\nFriedel.

There<br />\nwas some confusion as to this<br />\nnew star's origins.<br />\nHe, like most top musicmakers of the time, had a<br />\ngreat deal of connections with<br />\nEngland, but his home was<br />\nSeattle, Washington.

He went on to become a<br />\npitcher for the Orioles, within<br />\na few years, defying those<br />\nwho thought him too small to<br />\nmake the major leagues.<br />\nDave<br />\nLast Saturday<br />\nLeonhard returned to his<br />\nalma mater to speak to the<br />\nschool's young pitchers. With<br />\nhim was Jim Frey, the Oriole<br />\nBull Pen Coach who advertises himself as \"the only<br />\nlefty catcher in the majors.\"<br />\n<br />\nBaseball Coach Hal Thorne misses grounder as Oriole pitcher Dave<br />\nLeonhard looks on.<br />\n<br />\nNEM-LETTER<br />\n<br />\nHopkins<br />\nyear<br />\nThis<br />\ninaugurated a unique fall<br />\nbaseball program, the work<br />\nof coach Hal Thorn, a 1969<br />\nand<br />\nHopkins graduate<br />\nassistant Director of Student<br />\n<br />\nspous<br />\n<br />\nCatonsville Whips Jays<br />\nBy ED BRETHAUER<br />\nIn an exhibition game last<br />\nFriday afternoon, the Varsity<br />\nJay Soccor Team suffered its<br />\n.first defeat of the season<br />\nlosing to Catonsville by the<br />\nscore of 4-1<br />\nAs the score would seem to<br />\nshow, the game was almost<br />\ncompletely dominated by the<br />\n<br />\nTeam, whose<br />\nCatonsville<br />\nballhandling expertise and<br />\ngood defense held Hopkins at<br />\nbay throughout the game.<br />\nFor the Jays, the game was<br />\nmarked by the failure of the<br />\ndefense to clear the ball or to<br />\nblock shots and passes, and<br />\nthe failure of the offense to<br />\nput any pressure on the other<br />\n<br />\nFreshman Football<br />\nLooks Promising<br />\nIn a few weeks the freshmen football team will start<br />\nits 1970 season. Despite the<br />\nfact that only a few people<br />\nwent out (30 in all ), the team<br />\nhas a wealth of talent.<br />\nJack Thomas, a high school<br />\nall-Americam, who is an<br />\nexcellent passer, will be<br />\nleading the offensive attacks.<br />\nHe will be backed up by Pat<br />\nCameron, another fine arm.<br />\n\"Hombre\" Morales<br />\nBesides having great<br />\nquarterbacks, though, the<br />\nteam also has fine receivers<br />\nin \"Hombre\" Morales and<br />\nbruising tight end Mike<br />\nBogdan. Coach Howard<br />\nSchulman feels that if the<br />\nquarterbacks and receivers<br />\ncan generate a good passing<br />\nattack, the team will have a<br />\nsuccessful season.<br />\n<br />\nwith Bill Nolon and Harry<br />\nStringer, 2 of the tri-captains,<br />\nleading the way.<br />\nOne of the main plays the<br />\ncoach intends to use this<br />\nseason, namely the Houston<br />\nOption, will depend heavily<br />\nfor its success on these two<br />\nrunners.<br />\nVery Unyielding<br />\nThe defense, under the<br />\ndirection of tri-captain Al<br />\nSchiff, middle guard Mike<br />\nO'Brien and linebacker Jim<br />\nMoran, should prove to be<br />\nvery unyielding and punishing<br />\nto enemy quarterbacks.<br />\nPlayer Paucity<br />\nVarious obstacles though,<br />\nstill lie in the way of a successful season. The team's<br />\nin playing<br />\ninexperience<br />\ntogether, as well as the<br />\nshortage of players, could<br />\nhurt the team in its first big<br />\ntest of the season against<br />\nArmy Prep in October.<br />\n<br />\nHouston Option<br />\nThe ground game should<br />\nalso be potent this season,<br />\n<br />\nYet, spirit is good, and with<br />\neverybody hustling, the frosh<br />\nseasonshould be very exciting.<br />\n<br />\nteam's goalie.<br />\nMark<br />\nActually, until<br />\nManzione's goal in the third<br />\nquarter, Hopkins had very<br />\nfew direct shots on goal.<br />\nMost of the shots, in the first<br />\nhalf especially, simply<br />\nrepresented long passes<br />\ndownfield, which were easily<br />\ncleared by the Catonsville<br />\nfullbacks or goalie.<br />\nEven when the team did get<br />\na chance to score from close<br />\nup by means of penalty or<br />\ncorner kicks, they were still<br />\nunable to produce against a<br />\nsuperior defense.<br />\nOutfinessed<br />\nOn the other hand, the<br />\nCatonsville offense seemed<br />\nto penetrate and \"outfinesse\"<br />\nthe Hopkins' defense at every<br />\nturn. As a result, they were<br />\nable to take close-up shots out<br />\nof the reach of Weiss or<br />\nBuesscher, driving the ball<br />\nthree times into the corner of<br />\nthe net, and deflecting a<br />\ncorner kick shot for another<br />\ngoal.<br />\nDespite the depressing<br />\nnature of the game, the team<br />\nnever really lost its sense of<br />\npride or spirit, as reflected in<br />\nthe hustle of Manzione, Mark<br />\nHeller, Andy Smith, Jim<br />\nJohnson and Scott Tyner.<br />\nThe team still knows it can<br />\nwin, as it did last week<br />\nagainst Baltimore with an<br />\nof four<br />\nimpressive total<br />\ngoals. Yet, the outcome of the<br />\nseason still rests on Steve<br />\nWeiss' ability to mold the<br />\ndefense together, and Scott<br />\nTyne's skill in generating the<br />\noffense and picking up the<br />\nslack.<br />\n<br />\nAffairs. It was his enthusiasm<br />\nthat got the team up in the<br />\nbeginning of the year and<br />\nkept it up throughout the<br />\nseason,\" commented Bob<br />\nSlacum, the new frosh coach<br />\nwho played for Thorn last<br />\nyear.<br />\n\"I played for Gary Barrett<br />\nthe two previous years,\"<br />\nSlacum continued, \"but he<br />\ndidn't know how to make the<br />\nguys want to play for him.<br />\nAnd Hal recruited this year.<br />\nThere are nine or ten real<br />\ngood freshmen out this year,<br />\na few good enough to play<br />\nvarsity.\"<br />\nAfter brief introductions<br />\nthe players separated into<br />\nworkshop groups.

Mike Cuellar<br />\nthrows a good screwball. It is<br />\nprobably the best pitch there<br />\nis if your arm can take it. I<br />\nalways throw a slider when<br />\nI'm in a tight spot.\"<br />\nSomeone asked him about<br />\nthe Vitalis commercial.<br />\n\"It's turned out pretty well, I,<br />\njust got my first check,'<br />\ngrease-bailer Leonhard<br />\nreplied.<br />\nWhen questioned about the<br />\nWorld Series Leonhard<br />\nstated, \"If we were to have a<br />\nchoice, I guess most of the<br />\nguys would like another shot<br />\nat the Mets. That was pretty<br />\nembarrassing last year.\"<br />\n<br />\nSurrounded by pitchers,<br />\nand<br />\nsmiled<br />\nLeonhard<br />\npatiently answered all of<br />\ntheir questions.<br />\n<br />\n\"You know, \" Leonhard<br />\nremarked, \"when I went to<br />\nHopkins I really didn't like<br />\nlacrosse. The only people<br />\nwho came to see baseball<br />\ngames were those guys who<br />\nwere on their way to lacrosse<br />\ngames.\"<br />\n<br />\n\"How is a slider thrown?\"<br />\n\"What is your best pitch?\"<br />\n\"I have trouble with my<br />\nmove toward first base, what<br />\n<br />\n_Dave Leonhard, Hopkins<br />\n'62, shows that you don't have<br />\nto go to a big school to make it<br />\nin the majors.<br />\n<br />\nHop Looks Good<br />\nAgainst Lebanon<br />\nFielding one of the best<br />\nbackfields Hopkins has ever<br />\nhad and probably the best<br />\nbackfield in the league, the<br />\nJays gave Lebanon Valley a<br />\nlast<br />\nbeating<br />\nphysical<br />\nSaturday in their first big<br />\nscrimmage-- 13-10.<br />\nThe high point of the game<br />\nwas the defensive work.

The<br />\noffense would move almost at<br />\nwill and both senior quarterback Bob Pfeiffer and<br />\nsophomore Jim Pitts who<br />\nshared the quarterbacking<br />\nabout evenly looked good.<br />\nThe running offense scored<br />\n<br />\nboth touchdowns on 3<br />\nquarterback sneak by Jim<br />\nPitts for a ten yard score and<br />\na short run by fullback Pat<br />\nNeary.<br />\nIt was a time for the<br />\nspohomores to shine with<br />\nsuch standouts as Pitts,<br />\nNeary, Bond, Les MattheWs<br />\nwho backed up wide receiver<br />\nDave Pickall and made some<br />\ngood receptions, and TO<br />\nWeglick who does the place<br />\nkicking.<br />\nIf the Jays can put it all<br />\ntogether this SarurdaY<br />\nagainst Muhlenberg, we maY<br />\nwell be on our way to another<br />\nchampionship season with the<br />\nteam doing a lot better than<br />\never before<br />\nThe final score was 13-10,<br />\nbut the way the Lebanon<br />\nValley players left the field<br />\nyou could tell that the team<br />\ntook more than its share of<br />\nlumps as the Jays romped.<br />\n<br />\nCheerleaders<br />\nThere will be cheerleader<br />\ninterested<br />\nfor<br />\ntryouts<br />\nHopkins coeds in Shriver Hall<br />\ntomorrow at 7:30.

Hollis, Stuart Seidel<br />\nAndrew Green<br />\nJay Lenrow<br />\nRussell Lemle<br /><br />\nWasted Summer<br />\nA summer and $26,000 later, the Committee on<br />\nGovernance has given us more of the same. Its highlytouted innovation is a 19-member council to advise Dean<br />\nBenton. The Student Council will still assume its<br />\nfigurehead role. The Academic Council and faculty will<br />\nstill exclusively determine all course offerings, faculty<br />\npromotion and tenure. And the administration will still<br />\nexercise final say on everything.<br />\nOther significant changes recommended by the<br />\nGovernance Committee include another new committee, Committee on Instruction, charged to advise the<br />\nfaculty and administration on curriculum. At least 1 of<br />\nthe 8 members will be an undergraduate.<br />\nThe Student Affairs Committee will be abolished<br />\n(maybe it was too defiant for administration tastes last<br />\nyear), the General Assembly Steering Committee will<br />\nbe enlarged from 3 to 5 professors and a free-swinging<br />\nombudsman will help those in need. These minor<br />\nalterations the Governance Committee absurdly bills as<br />\n\"a new system of governance.\"<br />\nTheir 60-page report contained fancy verbiage<br />\n(\"accountability,\" \"clarified lines,\" \"new channels\")<br />\nand little substantive thought or work. It consulted 5<br />\nundergraduates during the summer for its \"imput,\" and<br />\nits meetings were closed to anyone else. But, of course,<br />\nyou could always write a letter to the committee.<br />\nTwo of the 3 undergraduates on the summer Governance Committee refused to sign the report citing its<br />\nstudent tokenism. Maybe that is its greatest indictment<br />\nsince these students (by no means \"radicals\") know<br />\nwhat the Committee left unsaid in its final draft.<br /><br />\nStudent Patronization<br />\nYou get what you pay for, goes the old saying. But<br />\nmost everyone has been fleeced at least once in life and<br />\nknows old sayings are not always true.<br />\nAll we're asking you to do is just think about it. Think<br />\nabout what $2500 per year means. Think of what $3,000<br />\nper year means. Here it's called tuition. About onethird of the people in this country live on that for a year.<br />\nBut that's an aside.<br />\nThe real heart of the matter is this: You're being<br />\ncharged for services rendered, or at least made<br />\navailable to you as a student. But what of the services<br />\nnot rendered?<br />\nThe long talked about student union--next year, we<br />\nhear for the umpteenth time.<br />\nParking facilities--well, you students will have to wait<br />\nyour turn behind the administration building.<br />\nBut be patient. You are paying now so that future<br />\ngenerations will have the opportunities you missed.<br />\nJust remember one thing. Your interests are only shortterm and no one expects you to make or participate in<br />\nthe making of long-range plans for the University.<br />\nThat's the job of long-range planners. You pay them to<br />\nplan.<br />\nThe decision to raise tuition was a shocker to us. When<br />\nthe present junior class came to Hopkins, the catalogue<br />\nsaid tuition was $2,000. Now,it is $2,500. Reliable sources<br />\nreport that class will be paying $2,750 next year.<br />\n...And please...don't get mad.<br /><br />\nAn Honorable Code?<br />\nBy CHRIS OHLY<br />\nThe aim of \"liberal democracy\" is the<br />\nguarantee to all societal members of certain<br />\ninalienable rights, among these the right of<br />\nself determination and<br />\nthe right of<br />\nprotection from arbitrary rule.<br />\nThe espoused aims of the Gordon-Benton<br />\nconduct code are as noble. The conduct code<br />\nproclaims a \"traditional dependence on self<br />\ndiscipline\" based upon \"rational inquiry and<br />\ndialogue\" that is the mark of an \"association<br />\nof scholars.\" We are told that the code, in its<br />\nformulation and application, must be<br />\n\"mindful of the interests and rights of its<br />\nmembers, must uphold the right of free<br />\nspeech, and must not betray its humane<br />\ntradition.\"<br />\nBut this noble rhetoric is fraudulent, and<br />\nbetrays the hypocrisy of the Gordon-Benton<br />\nadministration.<br />\nPunitive Code<br />\nAfter nearly eighteen months' debate over<br />\nthe institution of a judicial mechanism and<br />\ncode of conduct, designed mainly to protect<br />\nthe student from arbitrary administrative<br />\ndecisions of punitive nature, \"rational<br />\ninquiry and dialogue\" has been abandoned<br />\nby the administration.<br />\nWith the promulgation of the GordonBenton code on September 1, the administration has made clear its intention to<br />\nignore the fruits of debate in representative<br />\ninstitutions. After the ad-hoc committee's<br />\nreport on conduct of May 29, 1969 (an ad-hoc<br />\ncommittee appointed by the President), and<br />\nafter more debate in the Student Affairs<br />\nCommittee,from September 1969 to January<br />\n1970, and even after the President's carefully<br />\nthought out modifications of March 31, we<br />\nstill are faced with a new code.<br />\nThis code, is \"based on a special report ...<br />\nfrom the Committee on Governance,\" (It is<br />\ninteresting to note that only one of three<br />\nundergraduate members of that Committee<br />\nhas signed his name to that document.)<br />\nThis code was prepared by the Dean,<br />\nhowever, and seemingly, given to the<br />\nCommittee on Governance for its stamp of<br />\napproval. There is no more inquiry or<br />\ndialogue. Only the words of the Dean.<br />\nThe words of the Dean, are indeed, clearly<br />\noriented towards ensuring the University's<br />\n\"integrity as a social institution,\" rather<br />\nthan protecting the \"interests and rights of<br />\nits members,\" It is curious that every one of<br />\nthe listed \"obvious forms of misconduct\" is<br />\ndesigned to protect either University<br />\nfacilities, or its \"effective functioning.\"<br />\nIt is also curious that each of these items<br />\ncould be taken as a negation of some activity<br />\ntaken by some members of this \"association<br />\nof scholars\" in last year's disturbances.<br />\nDoes the University uphold its \"humane<br />\ntradition\" by implementing a code that<br />\nvalues property more than it values the<br />\nrights of its members? The University is not<br />\nthe buildings that make up the campus. It is<br />\nnot even the work that goes on within those<br />\nbuildings.<br />\nProtect People<br />\nThe University is the people who live<br />\ntogether in those buildings. Thus to preserve<br />\nits \"integrity as a social institution\" the<br />\nadministration should think of protecting<br />\npeople and not bricks and boards ... lest<br />\nthose bricks and boards become used by<br />\npeople to secure protection.<br /><br />\nIt should think of protecting the \"interests<br />\nand rights\" of individuals and not institutions ... lest those individuals abandon<br />\nold, repressive institutions for ones created<br />\nby themselves which serve their individual<br />\ninterests, rather than self-serving institutional ones. These are by no means<br />\nmeant to be threatening statements, merely<br />\ngeneral observations.<br />\nRepression breeds violence, whether that<br />\nrepression is administered on a nationwide<br />\nscale (as by the Nixon-Agnew-Mitchell<br />\nadministration in Washington), or by private<br />\ninstitutions.<br />\nAdministration Hypocrisy<br />\nI suggest that the University's administration is hypocritical when it claims to<br />\nbe \"liberal democratic\" in its orientation,<br />\nand denies the right of self-discipline and<br />\nself-rule to students. I suggest that it is<br />\nhypocritical when it makes this claim, and<br />\ndenies the fruits of its representative institutions' rational inquiry.<br />\nIt is hypocritical when it claims a<br />\n\"humane tradition\" and a desire to \"uphold<br />\nfree speech,\" and then denies \"the<br />\nunauthorized use of sound amplification<br />\nequipment,\" or \"holding demonstrations<br />\nwhich disrupt regular or essential\" activity,<br />\nwithout defining what regular or essential<br />\nactivity is.<br />\nIt is hypocritical when it claims to protect<br />\nthe student from arbitrariness of administration, and then gives itself special<br />\nemergency powers in which the Dean can<br />\ninvoke immediate penalties, call in civil<br />\nauthority, or \"use other suitable procedures<br />\nas the situation requires,\" when the Dean<br />\ndecides that an emergency situation exists.<br />\nStudents can do little about hypocrisy as<br />\nsuch ... at least now. We can do little now but<br />\ntreat such situations as isolated aberrations,<br />\nthough we may see them as endemic in<br />\nUniversity policy. What then can we as<br />\nstudents do to encourage this private institution to recognize our rights? Private<br />\ninstitutions legally are not bound to give due<br />\nprocess, and except for vagarity, the code<br />\nitself is legally a satisfactory document.<br />\nUnsatisfactory<br />\nNonetheless, it remains unsatisfactory to<br />\nstudents, because it fails to recognize our<br />\nInfringement upon<br />\nfundemental rights.<br />\nthose rights is dangerous not only because of<br />\nour immediate concern, but because it<br />\nmakes the University as an institution<br />\ncomplicit with, and non-neutral with regard<br />\nto, the repression of rights and just protest<br />\nnow beginning to appear in the larger<br />\nsociety.<br />\nThe application of incrementally increasing pressure on the administration,<br />\nseems for the time being, our only recourse.<br />\nWe must organize ourselves, and elicit<br />\nsupport from all members of the community<br />\nwho share in our outrage. We should<br />\nfamiliarize ourselves with all the issues<br />\ninvolved, to be able to engage in the<br />\n\"rational inquiry and dialogue\" that the<br />\nUniversity administration claims as our<br />\ntradition.<br />\nAnd if the administration continues in<br />\nstubbornness to abandon that method, we<br />\ncan only look forward to further, expanded<br />\nstrife within the University.<br />\nChris Ohly is a member of the Student Council<br /><br />\nLetters to the Editors<br />\nDISTRESSED<br />\nTo the Editors:<br />\nI was distressed by Art<br />\non<br />\nattack<br />\nLevine's<br />\nCongressman Sam Friedel.<br />\nIt was racist (Friedel is an<br />\n\"aging Jew\"), insinuating<br />\n(\"many of his teeth are<br />\nknocked out, perhaps in<br /><br />\nclubhouse fights long past\"),<br />\nsnide (Friedel says \"de\"<br />\ninstead of \"the\"), and finally,<br />\n(Friedel has a<br />\nbaseless<br />\n\"pitiful grasp of issues,\"<br />\nalthough he voted against<br />\nABM, for education, etc.)<br />\nI agree with Levine that<br />\nParren Mitchell would make<br /><br />\na better Congressman than<br />\nFriedel.

There<br />\nwas some confusion as to this<br />\nnew star's origins.<br />\nHe, like most top musicmakers of the time, had a<br />\ngreat deal of connections with<br />\nEngland, but his home was<br />\nSeattle, Washington. He had<br />\ntraveled to<br />\nWashington. He<br />\nhad traveled to England<br />\nWhere his blues-style of<br />\nPlaying found a more<br />\nreceptive audience.<br />\nIf at this point Hendrix had<br />\nstuck<br />\nwith blues, Eric<br />\n,ClaPton would probably still<br />\n\u00b0e. playing in coffee houses<br />\nWishing<br />\nhe had never quit the<br />\nYardbirds.<br />\nBut Hendrix<br />\ndecidea to find the limits of<br />\nthis new type<br />\nof music, to<br />\nexPloit to its fullest extent the<br />\nfact that he<br />\ndidn't just play<br />\nguitar, he played electric<br />\nguitar.<br /><br />\nphoto by rolling stone<br /><br />\nHENDRIX<br />\nThe Experience remained<br />\n_throughout its existence<br />\ndistinctly bi-racial, as Hendrix, himself part Indian,<br />\nrealized that his music was in<br />\nmany ways the product of the<br /><br />\nIla ndcrafted, Custom-made<br /><br />\nquestion you were asked after<br />\ngoing to see him was \"Gee,<br />\ndid he break his guitar?\"<br />\nAnd, indeed, you were a little<br />\ndisappointed if he didn't.<br />\nHendrix could not help but<br />\nbeing somewhat disgusted at<br />\nthe role he was forced to play,<br />\nbut he nevertheless continued<br />\nto pour out incredible, unclassifiable<br />\nsound.<br />\nHe<br />\nrealized the value of<br />\nshowmanship but refused to<br />\nlet it capture him, always<br />\nconsidering his music first, as<br />\n\"Voodoo Child\" shows.

That incredible album with the<br />\npicture of Hendrix in that<br />\namazing vest. No one could<br />\nbelieve the intensity of<br />\n\"Fire\"; There had never<br />\nbeen an album produced with<br />\nsuch energy, yet such finesse.<br />\nThe electric guitar would<br />\nnever be the same. We would<br />\nnever hear surf music again.<br />\nBut then the showmanship<br />\nseemed to get the better of<br />\nhim. Monterrey still ranks as<br />\none of the most incredible<br />\nperformances ever made,<br />\nHendrix capturing as never<br />\nbefore all of that which<br />\nmakes up rock. But, after the<br />\nmedia got a hold of it, the only<br /><br />\nBY MICHAEL HILL<br /><br />\nTo the end he fought<br />\nagainst his image for his<br />\nmusical (if not financial) life.<br />\nBreaking up the Experience<br />\nwas probably a move to break<br />\nout of the stereotype.

Despite the<br />\nfact that only a few people<br />\nwent out (30 in all ), the team<br />\nhas a wealth of talent.<br />\nJack Thomas, a high school<br />\nall-Americam, who is an<br />\nexcellent passer, will be<br />\nleading the offensive attacks.<br />\nHe will be backed up by Pat<br />\nCameron, another fine arm.<br />\n\"Hombre\" Morales<br />\nBesides having great<br />\nquarterbacks, though, the<br />\nteam also has fine receivers<br />\nin \"Hombre\" Morales and<br />\nbruising tight end Mike<br />\nBogdan. Coach Howard<br />\nSchulman feels that if the<br />\nquarterbacks and receivers<br />\ncan generate a good passing<br />\nattack, the team will have a<br />\nsuccessful season.<br /><br />\nwith Bill Nolon and Harry<br />\nStringer, 2 of the tri-captains,<br />\nleading the way.<br />\nOne of the main plays the<br />\ncoach intends to use this<br />\nseason, namely the Houston<br />\nOption, will depend heavily<br />\nfor its success on these two<br />\nrunners.<br />\nVery Unyielding<br />\nThe defense, under the<br />\ndirection of tri-captain Al<br />\nSchiff, middle guard Mike<br />\nO'Brien and linebacker Jim<br />\nMoran, should prove to be<br />\nvery unyielding and punishing<br />\nto enemy quarterbacks.<br />\nPlayer Paucity<br />\nVarious obstacles though,<br />\nstill lie in the way of a successful season. The team's<br />\nin playing<br />\ninexperience<br />\ntogether, as well as the<br />\nshortage of players, could<br />\nhurt the team in its first big<br />\ntest of the season against<br />\nArmy Prep in October.<br /><br />\nHouston Option<br />\nThe ground game should<br />\nalso be potent this season,<br /><br />\nYet, spirit is good, and with<br />\neverybody hustling, the frosh<br />\nseasonshould be very exciting.<br /><br />\nteam's goalie.<br />\nMark<br />\nActually, until<br />\nManzione's goal in the third<br />\nquarter, Hopkins had very<br />\nfew direct shots on goal.<br />\nMost of the shots, in the first<br />\nhalf especially, simply<br />\nrepresented long passes<br />\ndownfield, which were easily<br />\ncleared by the Catonsville<br />\nfullbacks or goalie.<br />\nEven when the team did get<br />\na chance to score from close<br />\nup by means of penalty or<br />\ncorner kicks, they were still<br />\nunable to produce against a<br />\nsuperior defense.<br />\nOutfinessed<br />\nOn the other hand, the<br />\nCatonsville offense seemed<br />\nto penetrate and \"outfinesse\"<br />\nthe Hopkins' defense at every<br />\nturn. As a result, they were<br />\nable to take close-up shots out<br />\nof the reach of Weiss or<br />\nBuesscher, driving the ball<br />\nthree times into the corner of<br />\nthe net, and deflecting a<br />\ncorner kick shot for another<br />\ngoal.<br />\nDespite the depressing<br />\nnature of the game, the team<br />\nnever really lost its sense of<br />\npride or spirit, as reflected in<br />\nthe hustle of Manzione, Mark<br />\nHeller, Andy Smith, Jim<br />\nJohnson and Scott Tyner.<br />\nThe team still knows it can<br />\nwin, as it did last week<br />\nagainst Baltimore with an<br />\nof four<br />\nimpressive total<br />\ngoals. Yet, the outcome of the<br />\nseason still rests on Steve<br />\nWeiss' ability to mold the<br />\ndefense together, and Scott<br />\nTyne's skill in generating the<br />\noffense and picking up the<br />\nslack.<br /><br />\nAffairs. It was his enthusiasm<br />\nthat got the team up in the<br />\nbeginning of the year and<br />\nkept it up throughout the<br />\nseason,\" commented Bob<br />\nSlacum, the new frosh coach<br />\nwho played for Thorn last<br />\nyear.<br />\n\"I played for Gary Barrett<br />\nthe two previous years,\"<br />\nSlacum continued, \"but he<br />\ndidn't know how to make the<br />\nguys want to play for him.<br />\nAnd Hal recruited this year.<br />\nThere are nine or ten real<br />\ngood freshmen out this year,<br />\na few good enough to play<br />\nvarsity.\"<br />\nAfter brief introductions<br />\nthe players separated into<br />\nworkshop groups.

Mike Cuellar<br />\nthrows a good screwball. It is<br />\nprobably the best pitch there<br />\nis if your arm can take it.

The<br />\noffense would move almost at<br />\nwill and both senior quarterback Bob Pfeiffer and<br />\nsophomore Jim Pitts who<br />\nshared the quarterbacking<br />\nabout evenly looked good.<br />\nThe running offense scored<br /><br />\nboth touchdowns on 3<br />\nquarterback sneak by Jim<br />\nPitts for a ten yard score and<br />\na short run by fullback Pat<br />\nNeary.<br />\nIt was a time for the<br />\nspohomores to shine with<br />\nsuch standouts as Pitts,<br />\nNeary, Bond, Les MattheWs<br />\nwho backed up wide receiver<br />\nDave Pickall and made some<br />\ngood receptions, and TO<br />\nWeglick who does the place<br />\nkicking.<br />\nIf the Jays can put it all<br />\ntogether this SarurdaY<br />\nagainst Muhlenberg, we maY<br />\nwell be on our way to another<br />\nchampionship season with the<br />\nteam doing a lot better than<br />\never before<br />\nThe final score was 13-10,<br />\nbut the way the Lebanon<br />\nValley players left the field<br />\nyou could tell that the team<br />\ntook more than its share of<br />\nlumps as the Jays romped.<br /><br />\nCheerleaders<br />\nThere will be cheerleader<br />\ninterested<br />\nfor<br />\ntryouts<br />\nHopkins coeds in Shriver Hall<br />\ntomorrow at 7:30.
