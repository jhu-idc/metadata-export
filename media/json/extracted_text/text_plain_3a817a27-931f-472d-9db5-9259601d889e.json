Meade Reynolds and Mr. Arthur Bloomfield<br />\nfrom TEE NEWS-LETTER is most unfortunate for the best interests of<br />\nthe paper. Mr. Reynolds has in particular borne the burdens of THE<br />\nNEWS-LF:TTF;R, which are more considerable than is generally realized.<br />\nTo him is due the increase in popularity of the periodical by the introduction of new ideas and more interesting material. It is customary<br />\nfor the remaining members of THE NEWS-LETTER Board to prophecy<br />\na brilliant future for all those who resign, but the writer feels sure that<br />\nthe former editors are well able to take care of themselves anyway\u2014in<br />\nfact, better able than the paper itself. In their case it would be more<br />\ntrite than usual. So the paper only hopes (very selfishly) to get along as well as the two<br />\nformer members. It extends its heartiest thanks to them and its best hopes and wishes and<br />\nall that sort of thing\u2014if they want them.<br />\n<br />\nHE NEWS-LETTER, as may be seen from the list of editors, is now in new<br />\nhands. After congratulating the former editors for their lucky escape<br />\nfrom the paper, it is customary to look around and see the whereabouts of<br />\nthe present Board and the amount of damage to be done. It will be<br />\nthe policy of the survivors to take a cheerful view of things. It has<br />\npreviously been a rather usual and obvious thing to do when in want of<br />\nsomething better to write of to decry the lack of spirit, or the lack of<br />\nwhat not, and if nothing real could be found to use a great amount of<br />\ningenuity to find a bone of contention. Not to be accused of smug selfsatisfiedness, we would at least call the attention of our readers to the<br />\nfact that whatever else may happen, the University will probably keep on its clock-like<br />\nprogress, our friend Walter will cut the hair of our grandsons to his accompaniment of \"yes<br />\nsirs,\" and what is more probable, we will continue to say \"when we move to Homewood\"<br />\nuntil some millionaire of a joking frame of mind plays a trick on the University in its sleep<br />\nand turns it out in the country to pasture. Nothing daunted by this, TILE NEWS-LETTER<br />\nwill endeavor to look upon both the cheerful side of things and the serious side. It only hopes<br />\nthat it will not have to say, `Apres moi le deluge.\"<br />\n<br />\n\fTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\n<br />\n3<br />\n<br />\n*<br />\nIF<br />\nIf<br />\n<br />\nHE J. H. U. A. A. might do a great deal towards making the cage a<br />\nbetter place to practice lacrosse and other sports in if they would have<br />\n*<br />\nsouth wall of the cage painted white. As it is now, the men very<br />\nthe<br />\nNI'<br />\n\u2022V<br />\n*<br />\n*<br />\nseldom get out till after dark, and if they try to get in a little stick work<br />\nv\u2022<br />\n\u2022<br />\nin lacrosse or catching in baseball, they are very much hampered,<br />\n*.<br />\n\u2022<br />\n.*<br />\nowing to the difficulty of not being able to see the ball in the air. This<br />\nV'<br />\nVi<br />\nV<br />\n*<br />\nis only true when one is looking toward the gymnasium or southern side<br />\nof the cage. When facing the.side next to Monument Street, it being<br />\npainted white, a ball is very easily seen. Now, if the entire color of<br />\nthe woodwork on the south side were changed from the present neutral<br />\ncolor to a bright white, it would be much less trying on the players' eyes, and they could<br />\nmake more accurate passes and more certain catches.<br />\n<br />\nHERE is one custom which has died out completely, but which is well<br />\nworth the trouble of resurrecting. It is Hopkins Night. For the benefit<br />\nof the Freshmen it might be well to say that heretofore one night a<br />\nweek was fixed upon for Hopkins Night, and on that night the students<br />\nmade themselves prominent at the show which was selected. It is the<br />\nduty of the Seniors to revive this lost custom. They should elect a<br />\ncommittee to take charge of the matter. This committee in turn should<br />\nfg<br />\n:Cft\"sc n:ft :c '<br />\ndecide upon a night to be known as Hopkins Night, and should also<br />\nft)<br />\nmake a list of plays which in their judgement are the best for the<br />\n4-0<br />\nseason. Through this committee the students could obtain their tickets<br />\nand in this way could have their seats together. THE NEWS-LETTER can assure you that you<br />\ncan have a great deal more fun going to the theater with a large bunch than by going alone<br />\nor with two or three. It is a pity to give up such a good custom, especially since there are so<br />\nfew customs at Hopkins.<br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER will publish a \"Guide to the Theaters\" and announce the Hopkins<br />\nNights at each of the shows to help along the scheme.<br />\n<br />\nTO WILLIAM BLAKE.<br />\nPainter\u2014Poet.<br />\n<br />\nAll in the garden of worlds sit I,<br />\nWhile blossoms dropfrom the pale Moon Tree<br />\nAnd Starflowers wave in the Wind of Time.<br />\nAnd I say, \"0 Dearling, come to me,<br />\nWhile Now is Now, and Thou art Thou<br />\nAnd I am 1, and We are We.<br />\nCome to me!

Now let the halls of our Alma Mater<br />\nresound with the slogan\u2014\"An undergraduate<br />\nfootball team.\" A college team is necessarily<br />\nan instigator of spirit, but the 'varsity football team for which men strive with the single<br />\ndesire to raise their college in athletic fame is<br />\nwithout doubt the foundation of the real,<br />\ncollege spirit. Hopkins wants a team composed of men with whom we associate daily,<br />\nwhom we know and love as college chums,<br />\nand whose efforts we can appreciate and encourage, and not a team of men, perhaps<br />\nfamous on the football field, but whom we<br />\nknow merely by name. Hopkins needs a team<br />\nfor which men come out in order to better it<br />\nand not just for their own exercise. Hopkins<br />\nmust have a team every member of which, in<br />\nthe hour of defeat, fight with the dogged<br />\ndetermination that their college banner will<br />\nnot trail in the dust, and not from a mere<br />\npersonal objection to being the under dog.<br />\nFor such a team there are several essentials,<br />\nbut first of all undergraduate members. Then<br />\nwe must have an experienced coach. A coach<br />\nwho could turn a winning team out of the<br />\nunlearned, but willing material offered. Hopkins could not expect from the existing classes<br />\na heavy team, say an average of a hundred<br />\nand fifty. But if the green country gawks of<br />\nvillages like Thurmont, many of whom had<br />\nnever before seen a football, could be thrashed<br />\ninto the existing Western Maryland Team,<br />\na winning one though light, Hopkins would<br />\nbeat St. John's next year.<br />\nThe elimination of. the training-table expenses at Tierney's would more than enable<br />\nHopkins to afford a professional coach, if the<br />\nphrase may be employed, a man whose profession is football coaching. The steps has<br />\nalready been taken to have an undergraduate<br />\ncaptain. A capable, experienced player an<br />\n<br />\ninfluential man at Hopkins, but above all a<br />\n\"hustler\" is desired. At present four undergraduates are on the football team. If an<br />\nundergraduate team is to be started for next<br />\nyear will it be fair to that embryo team for the<br />\nexisting team to choose the captain? Why<br />\nnot have the athletic board appoint a captain<br />\npro tern., who will push things along till next<br />\nyear's team has gotten together, and then let<br />\nthat team or body of men choose their own<br />\ncaptain. Next year we will most likely have<br />\na field to practice on at Homewood, a great<br />\nadvantage over this year's team. Let us all<br />\nhope for a better team! But let us show our<br />\nhopes by getting together and working.<br />\nUpon the ruins, let everybody take a hand and<br />\nbuild an invincible Rome, with no fear that<br />\nCarthage in the shape of St. John's may be<br />\nlurking around the corner.<br />\nEvP.',LETH H.

C. C.<br />\n<br />\n7<br />\n<br />\n\f8<br />\n<br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\n<br />\nST. JOHN'S, 2\u2014HOPKINS, 0.<br />\nThe same old Hoodoo. St. John's won 2<br />\nto Q. To be sure there was some dispute<br />\nabout the score, and many claim, with pretty<br />\ngood grounds, that there should be no two<br />\npoints and that what was called a safety was<br />\nreally a plain everyday touchback. We will<br />\nnot make any statements concerning the decision for the referee decided it was a safety,<br />\nand the fact remains that Johns Hopkins did<br />\nnot win although they should have.<br />\nSame old story, lack of practice, especially<br />\nin catching punts, and lack of condition. The<br />\ncatching of punts on such a day required a<br />\nmaster hand, for behind each punt there<br />\nrushed a 40-mile-an-hour wind which upset<br />\nall ordinary conditions and changed matters<br />\ngreatly.<br />\nThe game began with Hopkins against the<br />\nwind. The Black and Blue started with a<br />\nrush and plowed thru St. John's line at will,<br />\nonly to lose the ball on a fumble in the middle<br />\nof the field. St. John's immediately kicked<br />\nand with the wind behind it the ball landed<br />\nfar behind Hopkins goal line for a touchback.<br />\nThis course of procedure was kept up all during the first half until finally the ball struck<br />\nChesney's ahoulder and bounded back of the<br />\ngoal line. Chesney touched the ball down<br />\nwithout attempting to advance it, but the<br />\nreferee declared it a safety and the only score<br />\nof the game resulted.<br />\nIn the second half Hopkins kicked off with<br />\nthe wind. Here it seemed that there was<br />\nsome lack of headwork shown, for, instead of<br />\ntaking advantage of the strong wind and<br />\npunting more the Hopkinsites rushed the ball<br />\nalmost continually. Towards the middle of<br />\nthe second half Hopkins was going down the<br />\nfield at will, but after a beautiful 30-yard run,<br />\nHart dropped the ball as he was tackled on<br />\nSt. John's 15-yard line, and a seemingly sure<br />\ntouchdown was nipped in the bud. Toward<br />\nthe end of the second half the better condition<br />\nof the St. Johns team enabled them to withstand Hopkins rushes and when the whistle<br />\nblew both teams were just about able to hold<br />\neach other off without any appreciable gain<br />\nfor either side.<br />\nThere were some noteworthy points of interest, and one of these was the work of<br />\nMichael. Babe played in better form than he<br />\n<br />\nhas for some time, and on his tackle thru<br />\ntackle play made several good gains. The<br />\nback field worked together in fine shape and<br />\nHart and Webb tore off some good end runs.<br />\nHopkins line men charged well and managed<br />\nto get thru and effectively break up several<br />\nattempted place kicks. Last, but not least,<br />\nthe work of Ridgely deserves praise. To our<br />\nway of thinking the work of Ridgely has been<br />\nworthy of mention all during the year. At<br />\nend, Ridgely plays hard, uses his head well,<br />\nand fights every minute of the time with a<br />\nspirit that is good to look upon. It is just<br />\nthat hard fighting spirit which doesent take<br />\ninto account personal inconvenience that is<br />\nneeded at Hopkins, and it is a pity that more<br />\nof the undergraduates and graduate members<br />\nhave not seen fit to show it. The spirit is<br />\nneeded, not only on the football team, but in<br />\nevery other branch of college activities, and<br />\nit is conspicuous for its absence among the<br />\nfew rooters at the games.<br />\nThere was much improvement shown by<br />\nthe students at the St. John's game, for quite<br />\na large number of rooters accompanied the<br />\nteam and did their best. But there were not<br />\nenough and every man who was not there<br />\nshould be ashamed of himself.<br />\n<br />\nHOPKINS, 6\u2014UNIVERSITY OF MARYLAND, 0.<br />\nThe season ended on Thanksgiving Day<br />\nwith a victory for us over our old rivals, the<br />\nred and black warriors of the University of<br />\nMaryland, by the score of 6 to 0. Our<br />\nopponents were rather confident of victory,<br />\nafter the defeat of Hopkins, the week before,<br />\nat the hands of St. John's, and were disagreeably surprised at the outcome of the<br />\ngame. This makes the third successive defeat<br />\nwhich J. H. U. has administered to the<br />\nUniversity of Maryland.<br />\nThere was a good large crowd present, in<br />\nspite of the fact that the M. A. C.,\u2014Catonsville game attracted many people. University<br />\nof Maryland had a bunch of rooters, much<br />\nlarger than that which wore the black and<br />\nblue, and Maryland's colors were decidedly<br />\nmore in evidence than those of Hopkins.<br />\nMaryland was so discourteous as to hiss the<br />\nHopkins' team when they came out on the<br />\n<br />\n\fTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\n<br />\nfield\u2014an act which is not likely to produce<br />\ngood feeling between the two Universities.<br />\nThe game was well-played throughout,<br />\nboth teams fighting hard, but it cannot be<br />\ndenied that Hopkins showed the better form,<br />\nboth in kicking, and in advancing the ball.<br />\nMichael punted better than at any time this<br />\nyear, and, in addition, made several good end<br />\nruns on fake-kicks. Not one Hopkins punt<br />\nwas blocked, while several attempted drop<br />\nkicks by Maryland were blocked everytime.<br />\nRarely did Maryland gain first down, and<br />\nwere forced to kick often.<br />\nThe touch-down came in the second half.<br />\nMichael kicked a long punt which the quarterback missed, and Ridgely recovered on Marylands 25 yard line.<br />\nAn end run was<br />\nattempted, and then a forward pass gained<br />\nabout fifteen yards. From this point, Stewart,<br />\nby two line bucks, placed the ball on Maryland's four-yard line, whence Michael took it<br />\nover for the final score, Moss kicking goal.<br />\nThe work of our ends was particularly good,<br />\nboth on defensive and on running down under<br />\nkicks. Ridgely was hurt in the second half<br />\nand forced to retire, giving away to Brotherhood. Michael carried the ball well through<br />\ntackle, making several substantial gains. The<br />\nback-field played well together, and the line<br />\nheld finely.<br />\nThe victory was more or less unexpected,<br />\nand was all the more welcome. It was a<br />\nfitting ending for a more or less unsuccessful<br />\nseason. What the team needs next year, is a<br />\nscrub. This year, there has been no scrub<br />\neleven to line up against, and all the team<br />\ncould do was to practice signals. Next year,<br />\nlet us hope to see a large bunch of enthusiastic,<br />\ncandidates come out and form a strong second<br />\neleven to give 'Varsity a rub. We must make<br />\ngood next year.<br />\nA. M. C.<br />\n<br />\nCLASS FOOTBALL.<br />\n- Who is going to win the class game? The<br />\nonly way to tell that is to toss up a coin.<br />\nThe teams are evenly matched, and the game<br />\nshould certainly be an exciting one. Glancing at the personnel of the two teams, we find<br />\ngood meterial on both sides. On the Junior<br />\nline we find Tilghman, Hecht, Mathias, Williams, Wegefarth, Ridgely, Armstrong, Bren-<br />\n<br />\n9<br />\n<br />\nton, Frank and Breyer. This line will average less than the Freshman line, because<br />\nMichael will help to increase 1909's weight.<br />\nIn the Junior back-field are Abel, Streett,<br />\nBridgeman, Thompson and Chesney. From<br />\nthe above squad will be picked the team which<br />\nwill represent 1908. At present it seems<br />\nprobable that Ridgely may not be able to get<br />\nin the game owing to injuries in the Thanksgiving game.<br />\nOpposed to them will be a heavier team.<br />\nOn the Freshman line will be Michael, Donnell and Warren Stewart, Sattler, Maynard,<br />\nBonebrake, Russell, Maddren and Bevan.<br />\nThis constitutes a heavy and strong line. In<br />\nthe Freshman back-field are Chandlee, Bailey,<br />\nBird, Gutman, all of whom are fast, and have<br />\nhad some experience. With this array 1909<br />\nought to put up a creditable game.<br />\nThe class games are always interesting, and<br />\nattract a large crowd. This year's game<br />\nshould be doubly attractive, owing to the fact<br />\nthat the teams are so evenly matched. Following the class game will come the cane-rush.<br />\nLast year the class of 1908 lost, but they will<br />\ndo their utmost to win this year. Let us hope<br />\nthe best team will win.<br />\n<br />\nBASEBALL.<br />\nTo the Editor of the News-Letter:<br />\n<br />\nDEAR SIR \u2014As no time was set for the baseball meeting announced in the last number of<br />\nthe NEW-LETTER, it was thought better not<br />\nto have such a meeting, but to bring the matter<br />\nup before the various classes that our delegates<br />\nto the Athletic Board might see just what the<br />\nsentiment of the students was in regard to the<br />\nquestion of having a regular baseball team<br />\nnext spring or not. We believe, that if this<br />\nquestion were put before the student body, the<br />\nmajority would be in favor of having a team.<br />\nThis, however, would be necessary, for the<br />\nquestion simply is, Is there enough interest<br />\ntaken in baseball to justify the Athletic Board<br />\nin backing up the learn? That is, in guaranteeing its necessary expenses, and in awarding<br />\nH's at the end of the season.<br />\nWe think that the reasons we should have<br />\na team are, in the first place, there is no reason<br />\nwhy we should not have a baseball team.

Meade Reynolds and Mr. Arthur Bloomfield<br />\nfrom TEE NEWS-LETTER is most unfortunate for the best interests of<br />\nthe paper. Mr. Reynolds has in particular borne the burdens of THE<br />\nNEWS-LF:TTF;R, which are more considerable than is generally realized.<br />\nTo him is due the increase in popularity of the periodical by the introduction of new ideas and more interesting material. It is customary<br />\nfor the remaining members of THE NEWS-LETTER Board to prophecy<br />\na brilliant future for all those who resign, but the writer feels sure that<br />\nthe former editors are well able to take care of themselves anyway\u2014in<br />\nfact, better able than the paper itself. In their case it would be more<br />\ntrite than usual. So the paper only hopes (very selfishly) to get along as well as the two<br />\nformer members. It extends its heartiest thanks to them and its best hopes and wishes and<br />\nall that sort of thing\u2014if they want them.<br /><br />\nHE NEWS-LETTER, as may be seen from the list of editors, is now in new<br />\nhands. After congratulating the former editors for their lucky escape<br />\nfrom the paper, it is customary to look around and see the whereabouts of<br />\nthe present Board and the amount of damage to be done. It will be<br />\nthe policy of the survivors to take a cheerful view of things. It has<br />\npreviously been a rather usual and obvious thing to do when in want of<br />\nsomething better to write of to decry the lack of spirit, or the lack of<br />\nwhat not, and if nothing real could be found to use a great amount of<br />\ningenuity to find a bone of contention. Not to be accused of smug selfsatisfiedness, we would at least call the attention of our readers to the<br />\nfact that whatever else may happen, the University will probably keep on its clock-like<br />\nprogress, our friend Walter will cut the hair of our grandsons to his accompaniment of \"yes<br />\nsirs,\" and what is more probable, we will continue to say \"when we move to Homewood\"<br />\nuntil some millionaire of a joking frame of mind plays a trick on the University in its sleep<br />\nand turns it out in the country to pasture. Nothing daunted by this, TILE NEWS-LETTER<br />\nwill endeavor to look upon both the cheerful side of things and the serious side. It only hopes<br />\nthat it will not have to say, `Apres moi le deluge.\"<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br /><br />\n3<br /><br />\n*<br />\nIF<br />\nIf<br /><br />\nHE J. H. U. A. A. might do a great deal towards making the cage a<br />\nbetter place to practice lacrosse and other sports in if they would have<br />\n*<br />\nsouth wall of the cage painted white. As it is now, the men very<br />\nthe<br />\nNI'<br />\n\u2022V<br />\n*<br />\n*<br />\nseldom get out till after dark, and if they try to get in a little stick work<br />\nv\u2022<br />\n\u2022<br />\nin lacrosse or catching in baseball, they are very much hampered,<br />\n*.<br />\n\u2022<br />\n.*<br />\nowing to the difficulty of not being able to see the ball in the air. This<br />\nV'<br />\nVi<br />\nV<br />\n*<br />\nis only true when one is looking toward the gymnasium or southern side<br />\nof the cage. When facing the.side next to Monument Street, it being<br />\npainted white, a ball is very easily seen. Now, if the entire color of<br />\nthe woodwork on the south side were changed from the present neutral<br />\ncolor to a bright white, it would be much less trying on the players' eyes, and they could<br />\nmake more accurate passes and more certain catches.<br /><br />\nHERE is one custom which has died out completely, but which is well<br />\nworth the trouble of resurrecting. It is Hopkins Night. For the benefit<br />\nof the Freshmen it might be well to say that heretofore one night a<br />\nweek was fixed upon for Hopkins Night, and on that night the students<br />\nmade themselves prominent at the show which was selected. It is the<br />\nduty of the Seniors to revive this lost custom. They should elect a<br />\ncommittee to take charge of the matter. This committee in turn should<br />\nfg<br />\n:Cft\"sc n:ft :c '<br />\ndecide upon a night to be known as Hopkins Night, and should also<br />\nft)<br />\nmake a list of plays which in their judgement are the best for the<br />\n4-0<br />\nseason. Through this committee the students could obtain their tickets<br />\nand in this way could have their seats together. THE NEWS-LETTER can assure you that you<br />\ncan have a great deal more fun going to the theater with a large bunch than by going alone<br />\nor with two or three. It is a pity to give up such a good custom, especially since there are so<br />\nfew customs at Hopkins.<br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER will publish a \"Guide to the Theaters\" and announce the Hopkins<br />\nNights at each of the shows to help along the scheme.<br /><br />\nTO WILLIAM BLAKE.<br />\nPainter\u2014Poet.<br /><br />\nAll in the garden of worlds sit I,<br />\nWhile blossoms dropfrom the pale Moon Tree<br />\nAnd Starflowers wave in the Wind of Time.<br />\nAnd I say, \"0 Dearling, come to me,<br />\nWhile Now is Now, and Thou art Thou<br />\nAnd I am 1, and We are We.<br />\nCome to me!

Now let the halls of our Alma Mater<br />\nresound with the slogan\u2014\"An undergraduate<br />\nfootball team.\" A college team is necessarily<br />\nan instigator of spirit, but the 'varsity football team for which men strive with the single<br />\ndesire to raise their college in athletic fame is<br />\nwithout doubt the foundation of the real,<br />\ncollege spirit. Hopkins wants a team composed of men with whom we associate daily,<br />\nwhom we know and love as college chums,<br />\nand whose efforts we can appreciate and encourage, and not a team of men, perhaps<br />\nfamous on the football field, but whom we<br />\nknow merely by name. Hopkins needs a team<br />\nfor which men come out in order to better it<br />\nand not just for their own exercise. Hopkins<br />\nmust have a team every member of which, in<br />\nthe hour of defeat, fight with the dogged<br />\ndetermination that their college banner will<br />\nnot trail in the dust, and not from a mere<br />\npersonal objection to being the under dog.<br />\nFor such a team there are several essentials,<br />\nbut first of all undergraduate members. Then<br />\nwe must have an experienced coach. A coach<br />\nwho could turn a winning team out of the<br />\nunlearned, but willing material offered. Hopkins could not expect from the existing classes<br />\na heavy team, say an average of a hundred<br />\nand fifty. But if the green country gawks of<br />\nvillages like Thurmont, many of whom had<br />\nnever before seen a football, could be thrashed<br />\ninto the existing Western Maryland Team,<br />\na winning one though light, Hopkins would<br />\nbeat St. John's next year.<br />\nThe elimination of. the training-table expenses at Tierney's would more than enable<br />\nHopkins to afford a professional coach, if the<br />\nphrase may be employed, a man whose profession is football coaching. The steps has<br />\nalready been taken to have an undergraduate<br />\ncaptain. A capable, experienced player an<br /><br />\ninfluential man at Hopkins, but above all a<br />\n\"hustler\" is desired. At present four undergraduates are on the football team. If an<br />\nundergraduate team is to be started for next<br />\nyear will it be fair to that embryo team for the<br />\nexisting team to choose the captain? Why<br />\nnot have the athletic board appoint a captain<br />\npro tern., who will push things along till next<br />\nyear's team has gotten together, and then let<br />\nthat team or body of men choose their own<br />\ncaptain. Next year we will most likely have<br />\na field to practice on at Homewood, a great<br />\nadvantage over this year's team. Let us all<br />\nhope for a better team! But let us show our<br />\nhopes by getting together and working.<br />\nUpon the ruins, let everybody take a hand and<br />\nbuild an invincible Rome, with no fear that<br />\nCarthage in the shape of St. John's may be<br />\nlurking around the corner.<br />\nEvP.',LETH H.

C. C.<br /><br />\n7<br /><br />\n8<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br /><br />\nST. JOHN'S, 2\u2014HOPKINS, 0.<br />\nThe same old Hoodoo. St. John's won 2<br />\nto Q. To be sure there was some dispute<br />\nabout the score, and many claim, with pretty<br />\ngood grounds, that there should be no two<br />\npoints and that what was called a safety was<br />\nreally a plain everyday touchback. We will<br />\nnot make any statements concerning the decision for the referee decided it was a safety,<br />\nand the fact remains that Johns Hopkins did<br />\nnot win although they should have.<br />\nSame old story, lack of practice, especially<br />\nin catching punts, and lack of condition. The<br />\ncatching of punts on such a day required a<br />\nmaster hand, for behind each punt there<br />\nrushed a 40-mile-an-hour wind which upset<br />\nall ordinary conditions and changed matters<br />\ngreatly.<br />\nThe game began with Hopkins against the<br />\nwind. The Black and Blue started with a<br />\nrush and plowed thru St. John's line at will,<br />\nonly to lose the ball on a fumble in the middle<br />\nof the field. St. John's immediately kicked<br />\nand with the wind behind it the ball landed<br />\nfar behind Hopkins goal line for a touchback.<br />\nThis course of procedure was kept up all during the first half until finally the ball struck<br />\nChesney's ahoulder and bounded back of the<br />\ngoal line. Chesney touched the ball down<br />\nwithout attempting to advance it, but the<br />\nreferee declared it a safety and the only score<br />\nof the game resulted.<br />\nIn the second half Hopkins kicked off with<br />\nthe wind. Here it seemed that there was<br />\nsome lack of headwork shown, for, instead of<br />\ntaking advantage of the strong wind and<br />\npunting more the Hopkinsites rushed the ball<br />\nalmost continually. Towards the middle of<br />\nthe second half Hopkins was going down the<br />\nfield at will, but after a beautiful 30-yard run,<br />\nHart dropped the ball as he was tackled on<br />\nSt. John's 15-yard line, and a seemingly sure<br />\ntouchdown was nipped in the bud. Toward<br />\nthe end of the second half the better condition<br />\nof the St. Johns team enabled them to withstand Hopkins rushes and when the whistle<br />\nblew both teams were just about able to hold<br />\neach other off without any appreciable gain<br />\nfor either side.<br />\nThere were some noteworthy points of interest, and one of these was the work of<br />\nMichael. Babe played in better form than he<br /><br />\nhas for some time, and on his tackle thru<br />\ntackle play made several good gains. The<br />\nback field worked together in fine shape and<br />\nHart and Webb tore off some good end runs.<br />\nHopkins line men charged well and managed<br />\nto get thru and effectively break up several<br />\nattempted place kicks. Last, but not least,<br />\nthe work of Ridgely deserves praise. To our<br />\nway of thinking the work of Ridgely has been<br />\nworthy of mention all during the year. At<br />\nend, Ridgely plays hard, uses his head well,<br />\nand fights every minute of the time with a<br />\nspirit that is good to look upon. It is just<br />\nthat hard fighting spirit which doesent take<br />\ninto account personal inconvenience that is<br />\nneeded at Hopkins, and it is a pity that more<br />\nof the undergraduates and graduate members<br />\nhave not seen fit to show it. The spirit is<br />\nneeded, not only on the football team, but in<br />\nevery other branch of college activities, and<br />\nit is conspicuous for its absence among the<br />\nfew rooters at the games.<br />\nThere was much improvement shown by<br />\nthe students at the St. John's game, for quite<br />\na large number of rooters accompanied the<br />\nteam and did their best. But there were not<br />\nenough and every man who was not there<br />\nshould be ashamed of himself.<br /><br />\nHOPKINS, 6\u2014UNIVERSITY OF MARYLAND, 0.<br />\nThe season ended on Thanksgiving Day<br />\nwith a victory for us over our old rivals, the<br />\nred and black warriors of the University of<br />\nMaryland, by the score of 6 to 0. Our<br />\nopponents were rather confident of victory,<br />\nafter the defeat of Hopkins, the week before,<br />\nat the hands of St. John's, and were disagreeably surprised at the outcome of the<br />\ngame. This makes the third successive defeat<br />\nwhich J. H. U. has administered to the<br />\nUniversity of Maryland.<br />\nThere was a good large crowd present, in<br />\nspite of the fact that the M. A. C.,\u2014Catonsville game attracted many people. University<br />\nof Maryland had a bunch of rooters, much<br />\nlarger than that which wore the black and<br />\nblue, and Maryland's colors were decidedly<br />\nmore in evidence than those of Hopkins.<br />\nMaryland was so discourteous as to hiss the<br />\nHopkins' team when they came out on the<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br /><br />\nfield\u2014an act which is not likely to produce<br />\ngood feeling between the two Universities.<br />\nThe game was well-played throughout,<br />\nboth teams fighting hard, but it cannot be<br />\ndenied that Hopkins showed the better form,<br />\nboth in kicking, and in advancing the ball.<br />\nMichael punted better than at any time this<br />\nyear, and, in addition, made several good end<br />\nruns on fake-kicks. Not one Hopkins punt<br />\nwas blocked, while several attempted drop<br />\nkicks by Maryland were blocked everytime.<br />\nRarely did Maryland gain first down, and<br />\nwere forced to kick often.<br />\nThe touch-down came in the second half.<br />\nMichael kicked a long punt which the quarterback missed, and Ridgely recovered on Marylands 25 yard line.<br />\nAn end run was<br />\nattempted, and then a forward pass gained<br />\nabout fifteen yards. From this point, Stewart,<br />\nby two line bucks, placed the ball on Maryland's four-yard line, whence Michael took it<br />\nover for the final score, Moss kicking goal.<br />\nThe work of our ends was particularly good,<br />\nboth on defensive and on running down under<br />\nkicks. Ridgely was hurt in the second half<br />\nand forced to retire, giving away to Brotherhood. Michael carried the ball well through<br />\ntackle, making several substantial gains. The<br />\nback-field played well together, and the line<br />\nheld finely.<br />\nThe victory was more or less unexpected,<br />\nand was all the more welcome. It was a<br />\nfitting ending for a more or less unsuccessful<br />\nseason. What the team needs next year, is a<br />\nscrub. This year, there has been no scrub<br />\neleven to line up against, and all the team<br />\ncould do was to practice signals. Next year,<br />\nlet us hope to see a large bunch of enthusiastic,<br />\ncandidates come out and form a strong second<br />\neleven to give 'Varsity a rub. We must make<br />\ngood next year.<br />\nA. M. C.<br /><br />\nCLASS FOOTBALL.<br />\n- Who is going to win the class game? The<br />\nonly way to tell that is to toss up a coin.<br />\nThe teams are evenly matched, and the game<br />\nshould certainly be an exciting one. Glancing at the personnel of the two teams, we find<br />\ngood meterial on both sides. On the Junior<br />\nline we find Tilghman, Hecht, Mathias, Williams, Wegefarth, Ridgely, Armstrong, Bren-<br /><br />\n9<br /><br />\nton, Frank and Breyer. This line will average less than the Freshman line, because<br />\nMichael will help to increase 1909's weight.<br />\nIn the Junior back-field are Abel, Streett,<br />\nBridgeman, Thompson and Chesney. From<br />\nthe above squad will be picked the team which<br />\nwill represent 1908. At present it seems<br />\nprobable that Ridgely may not be able to get<br />\nin the game owing to injuries in the Thanksgiving game.<br />\nOpposed to them will be a heavier team.<br />\nOn the Freshman line will be Michael, Donnell and Warren Stewart, Sattler, Maynard,<br />\nBonebrake, Russell, Maddren and Bevan.<br />\nThis constitutes a heavy and strong line. In<br />\nthe Freshman back-field are Chandlee, Bailey,<br />\nBird, Gutman, all of whom are fast, and have<br />\nhad some experience. With this array 1909<br />\nought to put up a creditable game.<br />\nThe class games are always interesting, and<br />\nattract a large crowd. This year's game<br />\nshould be doubly attractive, owing to the fact<br />\nthat the teams are so evenly matched. Following the class game will come the cane-rush.<br />\nLast year the class of 1908 lost, but they will<br />\ndo their utmost to win this year. Let us hope<br />\nthe best team will win.<br /><br />\nBASEBALL.<br />\nTo the Editor of the News-Letter:<br /><br />\nDEAR SIR \u2014As no time was set for the baseball meeting announced in the last number of<br />\nthe NEW-LETTER, it was thought better not<br />\nto have such a meeting, but to bring the matter<br />\nup before the various classes that our delegates<br />\nto the Athletic Board might see just what the<br />\nsentiment of the students was in regard to the<br />\nquestion of having a regular baseball team<br />\nnext spring or not. We believe, that if this<br />\nquestion were put before the student body, the<br />\nmajority would be in favor of having a team.<br />\nThis, however, would be necessary, for the<br />\nquestion simply is, Is there enough interest<br />\ntaken in baseball to justify the Athletic Board<br />\nin backing up the learn? That is, in guaranteeing its necessary expenses, and in awarding<br />\nH's at the end of the season.<br />\nWe think that the reasons we should have<br />\na team are, in the first place, there is no reason<br />\nwhy we should not have a baseball team.

That is just the spirit<br />\nto correct at J. H. U. The<br />\nteam, but as the Athletic Board has not yet that we want<br />\nfeel that it is worth while for<br />\nmust<br />\nstudents<br />\nappointed a manager, they have not been them to come out and work hard in Freshman<br />\nattended to. Still, we have men who are only and Junior years, if they can make the team<br />\nwaiting for the proper authority to set to work in their Senior year.

The reasons for our seeming inactivity lacrosse team there is a fellowship and fraterand lack of united effort are, that it is still nal feeling which exists on no other Hopkins<br />\nmany months before our first game, and then team to such an extent.
