DEGREE<br />\nThe announcement in today's NEWS-LETTER of the regulation<br />\nregarding the future status of sophomores and freshmen marks,<br />\nwe believe, the first attempt on the part of an American college<br />\nto restrict the opportunities of the \"liberal education\" to those<br />\n\"who give evidence by the character of their work that they should<br />\nbe encouraged to acquire a liberal education.\" The terms of the<br />\nrestriction are broad: they include both the student who has done<br />\ngeneral good work and the student who has shown a particular<br />\naptitude, although he may not have measured up to the given<br />\nstandard generally.<br />\nNo one can question the fairness of the step. We do not doubt<br />\nthat many of those who will necessarily be dropped at the end of<br />\nthe year will complain that they have not received justice, but<br />\nthese men were warned at the beginning of the year that they<br />\nwould not be permitted to remain in the University. And it is<br />\nbetter that such men leave after the end of their second year, for<br />\nfew will maintain that a , person of average intelligence cannot achieve an average of 8.0 if he takes his education the least<br />\nbit seriously. If he does not regard the privilege of receiving an<br />\neducation a sufficient incentive to proper application to his studies,<br />\nhe is not deserving of that education. Similarly, if he is mentally incapable of meeting the standard, he is wasting his time by<br />\nstaying in college four years.<br />\nThe announcement does not state definitely just what is meant<br />\nby \"marked ability.\" The very fact that a general average of 8.0<br />\nis required, however, makes it practically incumbent upon the<br />\nvarious departments to require an average of approximately 9.0<br />\nin their own work to recommend a student because of this<br />\n\"marked ability.\" After all, the responsibility of the presence in<br />\nthe University of a student whose average has been less than 8.0<br />\nlies with the department that allows him to stay.<br />\nWe venture to predict that, inasmuch as the quality of the men<br />\nreceiving the A. B. degree will be obviously particularly high in<br />\nthe future, the University may find that it will be rendering a<br />\ngreater service to the youth of Baltimore and at the same time<br />\nwill remain faithful to the University's general policy if it should<br />\ncontinue to give the bachelor's degree indefinitely. This distinct<br />\nraising of the significance of the lower degree may, moreover,<br />\nnot only cause Johns Hopkins to continue to graduate bachelors<br />\nof arts, but it may have a stimulating effect upon the value of the<br />\ndegree in other institutions. Perhaps the immediate underlying<br />\nreason why there has been such a hue and cry raised in this country against the men graduated from American colleges has been<br />\nthat the sheep are not separated from the goats. If every college<br />\nin the United States would allow only those to enter the third<br />\nyear \"who give evidence by the character of their work that they<br />\nshould be encouraged to acquire a liberal education,\" the problem<br />\nof higher education would be a great step closer to solution.<br />\n<br />\nDe Soto might be a<br />\ntelephone man today<br />\nHe pioneered a way into new country \u2014 and back again.

B. DEGREE<br />\nThe announcement in today's NEWS-LETTER of the regulation<br />\nregarding the future status of sophomores and freshmen marks,<br />\nwe believe, the first attempt on the part of an American college<br />\nto restrict the opportunities of the \"liberal education\" to those<br />\n\"who give evidence by the character of their work that they should<br />\nbe encouraged to acquire a liberal education.\" The terms of the<br />\nrestriction are broad: they include both the student who has done<br />\ngeneral good work and the student who has shown a particular<br />\naptitude, although he may not have measured up to the given<br />\nstandard generally.<br />\nNo one can question the fairness of the step. We do not doubt<br />\nthat many of those who will necessarily be dropped at the end of<br />\nthe year will complain that they have not received justice, but<br />\nthese men were warned at the beginning of the year that they<br />\nwould not be permitted to remain in the University. And it is<br />\nbetter that such men leave after the end of their second year, for<br />\nfew will maintain that a , person of average intelligence cannot achieve an average of 8.0 if he takes his education the least<br />\nbit seriously. If he does not regard the privilege of receiving an<br />\neducation a sufficient incentive to proper application to his studies,<br />\nhe is not deserving of that education. Similarly, if he is mentally incapable of meeting the standard, he is wasting his time by<br />\nstaying in college four years.<br />\nThe announcement does not state definitely just what is meant<br />\nby \"marked ability.\" The very fact that a general average of 8.0<br />\nis required, however, makes it practically incumbent upon the<br />\nvarious departments to require an average of approximately 9.0<br />\nin their own work to recommend a student because of this<br />\n\"marked ability.\" After all, the responsibility of the presence in<br />\nthe University of a student whose average has been less than 8.0<br />\nlies with the department that allows him to stay.<br />\nWe venture to predict that, inasmuch as the quality of the men<br />\nreceiving the A. B. degree will be obviously particularly high in<br />\nthe future, the University may find that it will be rendering a<br />\ngreater service to the youth of Baltimore and at the same time<br />\nwill remain faithful to the University's general policy if it should<br />\ncontinue to give the bachelor's degree indefinitely. This distinct<br />\nraising of the significance of the lower degree may, moreover,<br />\nnot only cause Johns Hopkins to continue to graduate bachelors<br />\nof arts, but it may have a stimulating effect upon the value of the<br />\ndegree in other institutions. Perhaps the immediate underlying<br />\nreason why there has been such a hue and cry raised in this country against the men graduated from American colleges has been<br />\nthat the sheep are not separated from the goats. If every college<br />\nin the United States would allow only those to enter the third<br />\nyear \"who give evidence by the character of their work that they<br />\nshould be encouraged to acquire a liberal education,\" the problem<br />\nof higher education would be a great step closer to solution.<br /><br />\nDe Soto might be a<br />\ntelephone man today<br />\nHe pioneered a way into new country \u2014 and back again.
