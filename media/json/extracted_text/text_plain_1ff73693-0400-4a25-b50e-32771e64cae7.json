They have solicited the support of college newspapers throughout the country and some interest has been aroused<br />\nconcerning the attitude which the NEWS-Letter intends to take on<br />\nthe matter.<br />\nWe will not join with the Crimson in its anti-Volstead crusade.<br />\nThe reason for not taking part in the movement is not that we disapprove of the object which the Crimson desires to attain. We believe,<br />\nhowever, that a college newspaper exists for.two purposes: to bring<br />\nnews items of general college interest to the students and to influence<br />\ncampus opinion as much as may be possible on topics pertaining to<br />\ncollege. The discussion of national problems can find no legitimate<br />\nplace in the columns of the NEWS-LETTER or in any other college sheet<br />\nexcept those published by certain mid-western institutions which serve<br />\nas town papers. College papers should discuss college questions; papers<br />\nwhich serve both colleges and towns should carry items of interest to<br />\nboth, but neither the NEWS-LETTER or the Crimson are members of<br />\nthe latter class.<br />\nFurthermore, the editors of college papers should not express their<br />\nviews on national questions for purely ethical reasons. The college<br />\neditor is chosen for his familiarity with regards to college matters. His<br />\nopinions on the World Court, on the selection of Mr. Hughes as Chief<br />\nJustice, the outcome of Mussolini's dictatorship and like matters are<br />\nnot considered in his choice. Therefore, if he utilizes the privilege<br />\ngiven him of commenting on student affairs to divulge his own opinions<br />\non totally irrelevant topics, he breaks faith with his electors.<br />\nThe Crimson should not be unqualifiedly reproached for its campaign, because it is only spreading the views of another campus activity, namely, the debating society. It is the duty of the editor to<br />\nreport to the students all projects undertaken by the undergraduates.<br />\nFurthermore he should comment editorially upon matters of real<br />\nimportance. But to crusade against conditions which are not within<br />\nhis field, however evil he may think them to be, is to overstep the<br />\nbounds of both modesty and common sense.<br />\n<br />\nDEBATING AT HOPKINS<br />\nHE furor caused by the Harvard Debating Society leads us to consider the growing lack of interest in debating at Hopkins. Some<br />\ntime back, debating was the foremost among college activities but at<br />\nHopkins today it holds an appeal for such a small number of students<br />\nthat its very existence is hanging in the balance.<br />\nVarious reasons have been assigned for this decline in interest, chief<br />\n\u2022 among them being that the youth of today does not desire to go in for<br />\nanything which faintly smacks of the intellectual. It is charged that<br />\nthe tempo of college life has been speeded up so greatly that the<br />\nleisure necessary for both the preparation and attendance at debates<br />\nis lacking.<br />\nWe believe that the real reason for the conditions existing at Hopkins is to be found in the fact that other activities have become increasingly more pleasant, not that debating has grown less so. A<br />\ndecade or two ago, debating was almost the only extra-curricular activity, but with the growth of publications, athletics, and dramatic<br />\nclubs many adherents of oratory have necessarily found their way into<br />\nother fields.<br />\n\u2022 We predict that the Debating Council has not yet reached its nadir<br />\nand that the passing of the council from the ranks of activities is only<br />\na matter of time.<br />\n<br />\nT<br />\n<br />\n\u2022<br />\n<br />\n\"YOU WOULDN'T MN A BOG OUT<br />\n<br />\nON A NIGHT LIKE THIS!;aiied NELL<br />\n\"But father, with his slick city ways and perfumed hair, he turned<br />\nmy head. . \"<br />\n\"Out ye go!\" roared the irascible old yeoman...\"any gal of mine<br />\nthat gives away the last of my smoother and better OLD GOLDS suffers the consequences.

They have solicited the support of college newspapers throughout the country and some interest has been aroused<br />\nconcerning the attitude which the NEWS-Letter intends to take on<br />\nthe matter.<br />\nWe will not join with the Crimson in its anti-Volstead crusade.<br />\nThe reason for not taking part in the movement is not that we disapprove of the object which the Crimson desires to attain. We believe,<br />\nhowever, that a college newspaper exists for.two purposes: to bring<br />\nnews items of general college interest to the students and to influence<br />\ncampus opinion as much as may be possible on topics pertaining to<br />\ncollege. The discussion of national problems can find no legitimate<br />\nplace in the columns of the NEWS-LETTER or in any other college sheet<br />\nexcept those published by certain mid-western institutions which serve<br />\nas town papers. College papers should discuss college questions; papers<br />\nwhich serve both colleges and towns should carry items of interest to<br />\nboth, but neither the NEWS-LETTER or the Crimson are members of<br />\nthe latter class.<br />\nFurthermore, the editors of college papers should not express their<br />\nviews on national questions for purely ethical reasons. The college<br />\neditor is chosen for his familiarity with regards to college matters. His<br />\nopinions on the World Court, on the selection of Mr. Hughes as Chief<br />\nJustice, the outcome of Mussolini's dictatorship and like matters are<br />\nnot considered in his choice. Therefore, if he utilizes the privilege<br />\ngiven him of commenting on student affairs to divulge his own opinions<br />\non totally irrelevant topics, he breaks faith with his electors.<br />\nThe Crimson should not be unqualifiedly reproached for its campaign, because it is only spreading the views of another campus activity, namely, the debating society. It is the duty of the editor to<br />\nreport to the students all projects undertaken by the undergraduates.<br />\nFurthermore he should comment editorially upon matters of real<br />\nimportance. But to crusade against conditions which are not within<br />\nhis field, however evil he may think them to be, is to overstep the<br />\nbounds of both modesty and common sense.<br /><br />\nDEBATING AT HOPKINS<br />\nHE furor caused by the Harvard Debating Society leads us to consider the growing lack of interest in debating at Hopkins. Some<br />\ntime back, debating was the foremost among college activities but at<br />\nHopkins today it holds an appeal for such a small number of students<br />\nthat its very existence is hanging in the balance.<br />\nVarious reasons have been assigned for this decline in interest, chief<br />\n\u2022 among them being that the youth of today does not desire to go in for<br />\nanything which faintly smacks of the intellectual. It is charged that<br />\nthe tempo of college life has been speeded up so greatly that the<br />\nleisure necessary for both the preparation and attendance at debates<br />\nis lacking.<br />\nWe believe that the real reason for the conditions existing at Hopkins is to be found in the fact that other activities have become increasingly more pleasant, not that debating has grown less so. A<br />\ndecade or two ago, debating was almost the only extra-curricular activity, but with the growth of publications, athletics, and dramatic<br />\nclubs many adherents of oratory have necessarily found their way into<br />\nother fields.<br />\n\u2022 We predict that the Debating Council has not yet reached its nadir<br />\nand that the passing of the council from the ranks of activities is only<br />\na matter of time.<br /><br />\nT<br /><br />\n\u2022<br /><br />\n\"YOU WOULDN'T MN A BOG OUT<br /><br />\nON A NIGHT LIKE THIS!;aiied NELL<br />\n\"But father, with his slick city ways and perfumed hair, he turned<br />\nmy head. . \"<br />\n\"Out ye go!\" roared the irascible old yeoman...\"any gal of mine<br />\nthat gives away the last of my smoother and better OLD GOLDS suffers the consequences.
