LEXINGTON ST.<br />\n<br />\n'THE NAME of Nikola Tesla will always<br />\nI be associated with the invention and earlier<br />\n. developments of the induction motor. In fact,<br />\nat one time this type of apparatus was known<br />\nalmost exclusively as the \"Tesla\" motor.<br />\nTesla devised . this motor back near the beginnings of the electrical business, when practically everything was built by \"cut and try\"<br />\nmethods,and none of the accurate analytical processes of later days had been developed. It may be<br />\nsaid broadly that Tesla knew two fundamental<br />\nfacts\u2014first, that if a magnet were moved across<br />\na sheet of conducting metal, it would tend to<br />\ndrag this metal along; and,\u2014second, that the<br />\neffects of such a moving magnet could be produced by suitably disposed polyphase currents<br />\nacting on a stationary magnetic structure.<br />\nPerhaps others, at that time, also knew these<br />\ntwo facts, but if so, apparently they knew them<br />\nonly as two isolated facts. Tesla considered<br />\nthem in combination and the result was the<br />\nTesla motor, or what is now known broadly as<br />\nthe \"induction motor.\" These two facts, in<br />\ncombination, represent a fundamental conception, and all of the many millions of horsepower<br />\nof induction motors in use today throughout the<br />\nworld, are based upon these two fundamentals.<br />\nNaturally, Westinghouse, having fought single<br />\nhanded to advance the alternating current system,<br />\nwas supremely interested in the new type of<br />\nmotor. What if the, new motor did require<br />\n<br />\npolyphase circuits, while all existing circuits<br />\nwere single phase? What if it did require<br />\nlower frequency than any existing commercial<br />\ncircuits? These were merely details of the future<br />\nuniversal alternating system. The important<br />\nthing was to obtain an ideally simple type of<br />\nalternating current motor, which Tesla's invention offered. Tesla furnished the fundamentalidea.<br />\nHe and his associates, working for Mr. Westinghouse, proved that thoroughly operative<br />\ninduction motors could be built, provided suitable<br />\nfrequencies and phases were available. What<br />\nmatter if they did not produce an operative<br />\ncommercial system at the time? What matter if<br />\nit needed the powerful analytical engineers of<br />\nlater date to bring the system to a truly practicable stage\u2014men with intimate constructive<br />\nknowledge of magnetic circuits\u2014men on intimate<br />\nterms with reactive coefficients and other magnetic<br />\nattributes totally unknown to Tesla and his coworkers? In time the motor was made commercial, and it has been a tremendous factor in<br />\nrevolutionizing the electrical industry.<br />\nProbably no one electrical device has had more<br />\nhigh-power analytical and mathematical ability<br />\nexpended upon it than the induction motor.<br />\nThe practical result has been one of the simplest<br />\nand most effective types of power machinery in<br />\nuse-today. Thus Tesla's fundamental ideas and<br />\nWestinghouse'sforesight have led to an enormous<br />\nadvance in the world's development.<br />\n<br />\n\f", "format": "basic_html", "processed": "PRICE 5 CENT<br /><br />\nBALTIMORE, MD., MAY 19, 1922<br /><br />\nVOL.

LEXINGTON ST.<br /><br />\n'THE NAME of Nikola Tesla will always<br />\nI be associated with the invention and earlier<br />\n. developments of the induction motor. In fact,<br />\nat one time this type of apparatus was known<br />\nalmost exclusively as the \"Tesla\" motor.<br />\nTesla devised . this motor back near the beginnings of the electrical business, when practically everything was built by \"cut and try\"<br />\nmethods,and none of the accurate analytical processes of later days had been developed. It may be<br />\nsaid broadly that Tesla knew two fundamental<br />\nfacts\u2014first, that if a magnet were moved across<br />\na sheet of conducting metal, it would tend to<br />\ndrag this metal along; and,\u2014second, that the<br />\neffects of such a moving magnet could be produced by suitably disposed polyphase currents<br />\nacting on a stationary magnetic structure.<br />\nPerhaps others, at that time, also knew these<br />\ntwo facts, but if so, apparently they knew them<br />\nonly as two isolated facts. Tesla considered<br />\nthem in combination and the result was the<br />\nTesla motor, or what is now known broadly as<br />\nthe \"induction motor.\" These two facts, in<br />\ncombination, represent a fundamental conception, and all of the many millions of horsepower<br />\nof induction motors in use today throughout the<br />\nworld, are based upon these two fundamentals.<br />\nNaturally, Westinghouse, having fought single<br />\nhanded to advance the alternating current system,<br />\nwas supremely interested in the new type of<br />\nmotor. What if the, new motor did require<br /><br />\npolyphase circuits, while all existing circuits<br />\nwere single phase? What if it did require<br />\nlower frequency than any existing commercial<br />\ncircuits? These were merely details of the future<br />\nuniversal alternating system. The important<br />\nthing was to obtain an ideally simple type of<br />\nalternating current motor, which Tesla's invention offered. Tesla furnished the fundamentalidea.<br />\nHe and his associates, working for Mr. Westinghouse, proved that thoroughly operative<br />\ninduction motors could be built, provided suitable<br />\nfrequencies and phases were available. What<br />\nmatter if they did not produce an operative<br />\ncommercial system at the time? What matter if<br />\nit needed the powerful analytical engineers of<br />\nlater date to bring the system to a truly practicable stage\u2014men with intimate constructive<br />\nknowledge of magnetic circuits\u2014men on intimate<br />\nterms with reactive coefficients and other magnetic<br />\nattributes totally unknown to Tesla and his coworkers? In time the motor was made commercial, and it has been a tremendous factor in<br />\nrevolutionizing the electrical industry.<br />\nProbably no one electrical device has had more<br />\nhigh-power analytical and mathematical ability<br />\nexpended upon it than the induction motor.<br />\nThe practical result has been one of the simplest<br />\nand most effective types of power machinery in<br />\nuse-today. Thus Tesla's fundamental ideas and<br />\nWestinghouse'sforesight have led to an enormous<br />\nadvance in the world's development.<br /><br />"}], "field_media_file": [{"target_id": 37639, "display": null, "description": null, "target_type": "file", "target_uuid": "f5576d2d-2d4c-412c-8210-6aed59a3f4c4", "url": "http://digital.library.jhu.edu/system/files/2022-03/13009-Extracted%20Text.txt"}], "field_media_of": [{"target_id": 13009, "target_type": "node", "target_uuid": "58d41941-2d51-4608-8b00-283874760f5e", "url": "/node/13009"}], "field_media_use": [{"target_id": 15, "target_type": "taxonomy_term", "target_uuid": "c6a3a700-c007-4c4f-b77a-403d89b54878", "url": "/taxonomy/term/15"}], "field_mime_type": [{"value": "text/plain"}], "field_restricted_access": [], "field_unique_id": [{"value": "0122f0b4-c78d-4363-8f3d-4895e7dc5ed7"}]}
