He therefore<br />\nbought up many books concerning<br />\nother colleges, both here and abroad.<br />\nThese books formed the beginning<br />\nof the Johns Hopkins library system, that now has accumulated over<br />\n4)0,000 bound volumes.<br />\nThe collection of books in 1874,<br />\nwhen the University was in the embryonic stage. One of the first purchases was that of a one volume<br />\nedition of Webster's dictionary, and<br />\nonother one of the original volumes<br />\nwas a Latin grammar, written by<br />\nBasil Gildersleeve, who later became<br />\nthe first Professor of Greek in the<br />\nUniversity.<br />\nAvailable Funds Limited<br />\n<br />\nDue to the fact that the funds<br />\navailable for the purpose of buying<br />\nbooks was very limited, the motivating spirits of the University in<br />\nits early days decided to get only<br />\nthose books that were not available<br />\nat other libraries in the city. In<br />\n1876, the Peabody .Institute, situated within a few blocks of the lawn<br />\nthat formed the Hopkins \"campus\"<br />\nhad one of the best libraries suited<br />\nto scholarly research in this part of<br />\nthe country, and it was felt to be a<br />\ngreat loss of time and money to try<br />\nto duplicate their collection.<br />\n<br />\nAs the situation stood at the time<br />\nwhen the Hopkins University moved<br />\ninto the two converted houses that<br />\nwere to be its home for some time,<br />\nbooks were bought mainly on request of the faculty and graduate<br />\nstudents. Under this plan, the library came to include volumes that<br />\nwere especially valuable in research,<br />\nand was especially rich in bound<br />\nvolumes of periodicals. These were<br />\nhoused in Hopkins Hall in a room<br />\nthat held two hundred people.<br />\nMcCoy Gives $600,000<br />\n<br />\nMany gifts increased the number<br />\nof volumes until in 1890, the library<br />\noutgrew its quarters. J. W. McCoy<br />\nbequeathed a fund of $600,000 to<br />\nthe University which was available<br />\nfor building purposes, and with this<br />\nmoney, McCoy Hall was built. It<br />\nwas in the fourth floor of this building that the library found its new<br />\nhome. Here the departmental library systemn was developed into its<br />\npresent form. The main idea of this<br />\nplan was to put the books as near<br />\nto the department headquarters that<br />\nthey concerned as was possible.<br />\nChemical volumes were placed in<br />\nthat laboratory, and books pertaining to other subjects were put at the<br />\nfingertips of the professors in question.<br />\nFurther developments in the early<br />\nhistory of the lit4rary, notes as to<br />\nfamous books and collections that<br />\nare now in it, and other items of interest will appear in further issues.<br />\n<br />\nThree Hopkins football men,<br />\nAdam Bialoskorski, Oscar Helm,<br />\nTwo Chosen Teams Scheduued<br />\nand Jack Turnbull, including the<br />\nto Meet in Adams Debate,<br />\ncaptain and the captain-elect of<br />\nShortly<br />\nthe Hopkins team, were named on<br />\nWHEELER DECLINES<br />\nthe second All-Maryland team,<br />\nSPONSOR POSITION as selected by the Baltimore Sun.<br />\nBialoskorski, this year's captain<br />\nCouncil Accepts Challenges;<br />\nthe Hopkins eleven, was named<br />\nof<br />\nWill Not Debate Goucher<br />\ncaptain<br />\nof the mythical all-state<br />\nCollege<br />\nsecond team.<br />\nThis afternoon at 4:15 tryouts<br />\nTurnbull, third _highest scorer<br />\nfor the Junior Class Debating Team in the State, was named on sevwill be held in Room B, Levering eral selections this year, and has<br />\nHall.<br />\nbeen judged by sports writers as<br />\nTomorrow at the same hour the one of the most promising backs<br />\ntryouts will be held for the Senior in this part of the country.

He therefore<br />\nbought up many books concerning<br />\nother colleges, both here and abroad.<br />\nThese books formed the beginning<br />\nof the Johns Hopkins library system, that now has accumulated over<br />\n4)0,000 bound volumes.<br />\nThe collection of books in 1874,<br />\nwhen the University was in the embryonic stage. One of the first purchases was that of a one volume<br />\nedition of Webster's dictionary, and<br />\nonother one of the original volumes<br />\nwas a Latin grammar, written by<br />\nBasil Gildersleeve, who later became<br />\nthe first Professor of Greek in the<br />\nUniversity.<br />\nAvailable Funds Limited<br /><br />\nDue to the fact that the funds<br />\navailable for the purpose of buying<br />\nbooks was very limited, the motivating spirits of the University in<br />\nits early days decided to get only<br />\nthose books that were not available<br />\nat other libraries in the city. In<br />\n1876, the Peabody .Institute, situated within a few blocks of the lawn<br />\nthat formed the Hopkins \"campus\"<br />\nhad one of the best libraries suited<br />\nto scholarly research in this part of<br />\nthe country, and it was felt to be a<br />\ngreat loss of time and money to try<br />\nto duplicate their collection.<br /><br />\nAs the situation stood at the time<br />\nwhen the Hopkins University moved<br />\ninto the two converted houses that<br />\nwere to be its home for some time,<br />\nbooks were bought mainly on request of the faculty and graduate<br />\nstudents. Under this plan, the library came to include volumes that<br />\nwere especially valuable in research,<br />\nand was especially rich in bound<br />\nvolumes of periodicals. These were<br />\nhoused in Hopkins Hall in a room<br />\nthat held two hundred people.<br />\nMcCoy Gives $600,000<br /><br />\nMany gifts increased the number<br />\nof volumes until in 1890, the library<br />\noutgrew its quarters. J. W. McCoy<br />\nbequeathed a fund of $600,000 to<br />\nthe University which was available<br />\nfor building purposes, and with this<br />\nmoney, McCoy Hall was built. It<br />\nwas in the fourth floor of this building that the library found its new<br />\nhome. Here the departmental library systemn was developed into its<br />\npresent form. The main idea of this<br />\nplan was to put the books as near<br />\nto the department headquarters that<br />\nthey concerned as was possible.<br />\nChemical volumes were placed in<br />\nthat laboratory, and books pertaining to other subjects were put at the<br />\nfingertips of the professors in question.<br />\nFurther developments in the early<br />\nhistory of the lit4rary, notes as to<br />\nfamous books and collections that<br />\nare now in it, and other items of interest will appear in further issues.<br /><br />\nThree Hopkins football men,<br />\nAdam Bialoskorski, Oscar Helm,<br />\nTwo Chosen Teams Scheduued<br />\nand Jack Turnbull, including the<br />\nto Meet in Adams Debate,<br />\ncaptain and the captain-elect of<br />\nShortly<br />\nthe Hopkins team, were named on<br />\nWHEELER DECLINES<br />\nthe second All-Maryland team,<br />\nSPONSOR POSITION as selected by the Baltimore Sun.<br />\nBialoskorski, this year's captain<br />\nCouncil Accepts Challenges;<br />\nthe Hopkins eleven, was named<br />\nof<br />\nWill Not Debate Goucher<br />\ncaptain<br />\nof the mythical all-state<br />\nCollege<br />\nsecond team.<br />\nThis afternoon at 4:15 tryouts<br />\nTurnbull, third _highest scorer<br />\nfor the Junior Class Debating Team in the State, was named on sevwill be held in Room B, Levering eral selections this year, and has<br />\nHall.<br />\nbeen judged by sports writers as<br />\nTomorrow at the same hour the one of the most promising backs<br />\ntryouts will be held for the Senior in this part of the country.
