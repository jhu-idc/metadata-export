According to a news item<br />\nwe read the other day, over a thousand people paid to hear Mr.<br />\nClarence Darrow exchange words with Mr. Wayne B. Wheeler<br />\nupon the merits of the Prohibition.<br />\nThe attendance at a debate appears to be dependent not<br />\nonly upon the excellence of the debaters themselves, but also<br />\nupon the subject of the argument. What undergraduate, for example, would want to listen to two teams of three men each'<br />\ndiscourse upon the political status of Baluchistan? But if the<br />\ndebate dealt with stage and book censorship and promised to be<br />\noverflowing with racy erotic passages, the hall would probably<br />\nbe filled.<br />\nAll of which proves once more that an undergraduate is a<br />\nvery, very human animal, and not an object of special interest<br />\nto be iSolated and studied much as a biologist studies a guinea pig.<br />\n<br />\nTHE HALF WAY MARK<br />\nEarly season predictions assumed that if the lacrosse team.<br />\n. could pass the half-way mark with victories over Yale and Army,<br />\nsuccess for the remainder of the schedule should follow. Therefore, according to .this, reasoning, Swarthmore, Navy, St. Johns,<br />\nand Maryland should pave the way for. the.second championship<br />\nin two years.<br />\nFor several years previous b 1926, a very similar -condition<br />\nexisted. The team would get off to a good start, become highly<br />\nconfident,\u2014and then break. In 19+26, however, there was no<br />\nbreak, and though each succee4ng- game was a climax in itself,<br />\nno game was allowed to become an anti-climax. The result is that<br />\nthe members of the 1926 team wear little gold medals on' their<br />\nwatch fobs.<br />\n1927 can take either course. Though Army was supposed to<br />\nbe the chief stumbling-block, Navy and Maryland still loom large<br />\nupon the horizon. And Maryland seems to get better each week.<br />\nThe remainder of the season, in light of these facts; will be<br />\nthe really brilliant part from the viewpoint of a lacrosse enthusiast.

According to a news item<br />\nwe read the other day, over a thousand people paid to hear Mr.<br />\nClarence Darrow exchange words with Mr. Wayne B. Wheeler<br />\nupon the merits of the Prohibition.<br />\nThe attendance at a debate appears to be dependent not<br />\nonly upon the excellence of the debaters themselves, but also<br />\nupon the subject of the argument. What undergraduate, for example, would want to listen to two teams of three men each'<br />\ndiscourse upon the political status of Baluchistan? But if the<br />\ndebate dealt with stage and book censorship and promised to be<br />\noverflowing with racy erotic passages, the hall would probably<br />\nbe filled.<br />\nAll of which proves once more that an undergraduate is a<br />\nvery, very human animal, and not an object of special interest<br />\nto be iSolated and studied much as a biologist studies a guinea pig.<br /><br />\nTHE HALF WAY MARK<br />\nEarly season predictions assumed that if the lacrosse team.<br />\n. could pass the half-way mark with victories over Yale and Army,<br />\nsuccess for the remainder of the schedule should follow. Therefore, according to .this, reasoning, Swarthmore, Navy, St. Johns,<br />\nand Maryland should pave the way for. the.second championship<br />\nin two years.<br />\nFor several years previous b 1926, a very similar -condition<br />\nexisted. The team would get off to a good start, become highly<br />\nconfident,\u2014and then break. In 19+26, however, there was no<br />\nbreak, and though each succee4ng- game was a climax in itself,<br />\nno game was allowed to become an anti-climax. The result is that<br />\nthe members of the 1926 team wear little gold medals on' their<br />\nwatch fobs.<br />\n1927 can take either course. Though Army was supposed to<br />\nbe the chief stumbling-block, Navy and Maryland still loom large<br />\nupon the horizon. And Maryland seems to get better each week.<br />\nThe remainder of the season, in light of these facts; will be<br />\nthe really brilliant part from the viewpoint of a lacrosse enthusiast.
