Since we<br />\nhadn't been to Cuba over the vacation, we wanted to<br />\nshield our distinctive and carefully cultivated pallor from<br />\nthe sun's rays and thus avoid acquiring an ignominiously<br />\nhealthy tint. While loitering in a mossy corner, we observed an equally mossy student scurry from his room and<br />\nstride out of the building without noticing us as he passed.<br />\nHis briefcase was overflowing and his face showed an<br />\ningrained anxiety which was not at all in concurrence with<br />\nour concept of the collegiate ideal. Wondering what motivated such an obviously non-acceptable type, we visited<br />\nhis neighbors, who were discussing the most casual way of<br />\nlighting a pipe. They laughed when we mentioned their<br />\nfellow student and congratulated us at having seen him<br />\nout of his room.<br />\n\"A real troll,\" said one. \"He studies all the time.<br />\nShouldn't be in this school. All night long he studies and<br />\nhe still doesn't pass. He's a real zero.\"<br />\nThe speaker's roommate, having successfully lighted<br />\nhis pipe, was aloof.<br />\n\"He went to some New England prep school which<br />\nI never heard of. He couldn't have gotten the marks to get<br />\nin here if his old man hadn't paid a tutor to drill the<br />\nstuff through his skull. His old man wants him to be a<br />\ndoctor.\"<br />\n\"I take analytics with him. This is a real gut. I<br />\nstudied for-two hours for the last test and got an eightytwo. This kid studied for a week and still failed. The<br />\ninstructor hates his guts. All be does is ask these stupid<br />\nquestions. He sits right in front of class and all the time<br />\nhe's asking questions. Now the-instructor just ignores the<br />\nkid. He's hopeless. He's got this tremendous filing system.<br />\nThe instructor belches, even, he classifies it. And then,<br />\nthis is rare, he can't find it. He'll make a good doctor.<br />\nYou'd think he'd take the hint. His advisor keeps telling<br />\nhim he's got to get his marks up or he'll flunk out.\"<br />\n\"He's a real pain. All the time he's hanging around<br />\nwith these corny jokes. I can't tolerate the kid. Last night<br />\nwe fixed him. He went down to the john last night and<br />\nwhile he was gone, we took his notes and put the ashes<br />\nof some blank papers in their place. He can't even take<br />\na joke. When he got back, he didn't say anything, just<br />\nlooked for a minute and slammed the door.<br />\n\"He was almost crying. \u2022He's really out of it,\" said<br />\nthe aloof one who was now practicing his pipe lighting in<br />\nfront of the mirror.<br />\n\"He's had it though,\" said the first:\"On that analytics<br />\ntest, I saw him looking at this other guy's paper. Now I<br />\ncan't take cheating. I nudged the guy next to me, and this<br />\nkid, who's real gung ho, announced that the test was under<br />\nthe Honor System.<br />\nThis stopped him until just before the end of the test.<br />\nHe got real nervous and started looking around again.<br />\nBy now I had three other guys watching him, and we<br />\nreally got him.<br />\n\"Guilty? Sure he's guilty. We watched him cheat.<br />\nThere's no doubt about it. The Honor Commission will<br />\ntake care of him. After all that's what it's for, isn't it?<br />\nTo take care of guys. who don't belong here ?\"<br />\nThe sun finally went behind a cloud, so we took advantage of our opportunity.<br />\n<br />\n\u2014ZEGER<br />\n<br />\nDR. ROBERT C. ANGELL<br />\nby GORDON SCHOCHET<br />\nFeature Editor<br />\n\"Interested faculty members\"<br />\nare now engaged in the investigation of the possibilities of instituting a new department at<br />\nthe Hopkins, according to Dr. G.<br />\nWilson Shaffer, Dean of the<br />\nHomewood Schools.<br />\nThe academic field into which<br />\nthis faculty group is looking<br />\nmight generally be called \"sociology:\" but Dean Shaffer went on<br />\nto comment that \"we actually<br />\nhaven't talked. about a department . . by that name.:' It<br />\nmight better be expressed, he<br />\nsaid, as \"social relations.\"<br />\nThough a preliminary committee report has been submitted to University President Milton S. Eisenhower, the i'esults of<br />\npresent efforts along these lines<br />\nhas not been made public.<br />\n\u2022<br />\nLynn Poole, publicity director<br />\nfor the Hopkins, feels that the<br />\ncommittee's report will not be<br />\nforthcoming \"for quite some<br />\ntime yet ... early in the fall, I'd<br />\nsay.\" Until that time, it will not<br />\nbe possible to gain access to the<br />\ninformation on the work which<br />\nhas been done.<br />\nFaculty Response<br />\nWhat will happen once the<br />\nreport of the committee is made<br />\npublic Dean Shaffer did not wish<br />\nto say. \"There is,\" he said, \"(a)<br />\ncertainty that the faculty in<br />\ngeneral would like to have more<br />\nwork in 'social relations' somewhere on the campus.\"<br />\nAside from lack finances<br />\navailable for the support of another department at Homewood,<br />\nDean Shaffer pointed to a general lack of agreement among the<br />\ninterested members of the faculty as to \"where the emphasis<br />\nshould be placed.\"<br />\n<br />\nThree specific academic fields<br />\nin which this \"emphasis\" could<br />\nbe concentrated are 'Social<br />\ntheory, cultural anthropology,<br />\nand demography,\" the Dean stated; the establishment of a department in \"social relations\"<br />\nwould necessitate a general degree of accord among the present faculty as to the specific<br />\nemphasis.<br />\n\"We have talked from time to<br />\ntime about having more people<br />\nin these areas,\" Dean Shaffer<br />\nsaid in reference to the three<br />\nnamed above, \"\u2014not necessarily<br />\na department, but having more<br />\npeople in those fields,\" he stated,<br />\nemphasizing the point.<br />\nClarifying the position of the<br />\nUniversity in respect to the absence of specialization in those<br />\nareas, the Dean continued that<br />\n\"Hopkins makes no effort of a<br />\npretense to cover all fields .. .<br />\nWe just assert that what we do<br />\ncover, we do well.\"<br />\nFields Well Covered<br />\nBy way of contrast, he noted<br />\nthat many of the \"larger\"<br />\nschooLs claim to be ''quite<br />\nthorough in their academic<br />\ncoverage, but few of them can<br />\nclaim to cover all of their fields<br />\nas well as we cover all of ours.<br />\n\"There are a whole lot of<br />\nthings that we don't cover at<br />\nHopkins\u2014'social relations' is just<br />\none of them\u2014 ,which we would<br />\nlike to include (jn our curriculum); but our finances will not<br />\npermit it .. . So we stick to the<br />\nidea of what we do cover, we<br />\ncover well.\"<br />\nDean Shaffer noted, however,<br />\nthat facilities are presently<br />\navailable for undergraduate work<br />\nin the general field of \"social<br />\nrelations.\" He pointed to the<br />\nlibraries and faculty members<br />\n<br />\nFor My Ned Act<br />\n,\u201e<br />\n<br />\n\u2022<br />\n<br />\n\u2022<br />\n<br />\ndoing the \"necessary work\"<br />\nin the Political Science, Political<br />\nEconomy, History, and Psychology departments. An advanced<br />\ndegree, however, would be \"another matter.\"<br />\nIn conclusion, Dean Shaffer<br />\nagain noted the desire among<br />\nthe members of the faculty for<br />\nwork in ''social theory:\" but he<br />\nalso pointed again to others of<br />\nhis previous statements: \"If we<br />\nsat down, we could make a list<br />\nof the fields that we don't cover.<br />\nI believe it is true, however, that<br />\nthe field which has come UP<br />\nmost often in our faculty discussions is social theory.\"<br />\nAngell's View<br />\nTurning to the more specific,<br />\nwe visited Professor Robert C.<br />\nAngell, Resident Deiches Lecturer in Social Relations this semester. Professor Angell is 3<br />\nmember of the faculty of the<br />\nUniversity of Michigan, and was<br />\nchairman af that school's Sociology Department from 19401952.<br />\nWhen we asked him specifically \"What is Sociology?\" Pr\u00b0fesSor Angell drew a parallel,<br />\nrather than provide us with a<br />\nfinite meaning.<br />\n\"Just as economy has as its<br />\ncore the study of the phenomenon of wealth,\" he said, \"and the<br />\nPolitical scientist is interested in<br />\npower, the sociologist is cancerfled with what you might call<br />\nsolidarity\u2014or loyalty\u2014relations<br />\nin life . . . That's about mY<br />\n'stock' answer,\" he commented'<br />\nExpanding this point further,<br />\nProfessor Angell went on to saY<br />\n\"We (the sociologists) are concerned with studies of grouPs t\u20221,3<br />\nwhich we belong because we feel<br />\nthe need to belong ... Men are<br />\nsocial animals\u2014they don't join<br />\ngroups (just) for power to be<br />\ngained . . . There is a certain<br />\nsolidarity in group behavior \u2022<br />\nSociology is a study of the waYs<br />\nof<br />\nof maintaining this solidarity<br />\nr'<br />\nlife\u2014people who 'hang togethe<br />\noperating<br />\n(the group) as an<br />\norganism\u2014as a way of life.\"<br />\nA Residual Discipline<br />\nConcerning the \"evolution\" 01<br />\nsociohis field, Dr. Angell called<br />\nlogy a \"residual discipline.\" Ec\u00b0e,<br />\nnomics and political scienc<br />\nassocia,<br />\ntwo of the more closely<br />\nted areas, are \"more specialized,'<br />\nstarhe commented. \"They got<br />\nted first (as academic endev<br />\nvors) . .. Sociology is the studY<br />\n,<br />\nof what is left (to the social<br />\nstructure) after the materials 01<br />\nthe related areas are deducted-which leaves a great deal!\"<br />\nThere is, however, another<br />\nview of the nature and function<br />\nof sociology which Professor An'<br />\ngell noted. \"This is the French<br />\nview,\" he stated, \"which holds<br />\nthat sociology is the general social science of which political<br />\nscience and economics are<br />\nbranches\u2014that sociology is the<br />\ndominant integrating discipline<br />\nin the social sciences.\"<br />\nThe American view, however,<br />\nis \"less inclusive . . .

At<br />\nthat time much talk was heard about the Frosh squad and<br />\nthe happy days that were ahead for the 1957 stick squad. Two Down, Six To Go<br />\nThe first two contests this year have proven these predictions to be true.<br />\nThe present edition of the stick squad has a wealth<br />\nof talent, both sophomore and Upperclassmen, and has an<br />\nexcellent chance to have a very successful season. (We<br />\nwouldn't say \"title\" for fear of jinxing the squad).<br />\nOften overlooked when discussing the Jays is the defensive unit that has performed meritoriously in both<br />\nof the Jay triumphs. The unit of Walt Mitchell, John McNealy, and Bob Edwards held the Yale squad shotless for<br />\nthirteen minutes and then hamstringed the Cavalier offense throughout the game. This unit possess both speed<br />\nand ruggedness and any attack unit will have great difficulty finding the scoring range against them.<br />\nNot to be overlooked when looking for reasons for the<br />\nJay success are the prowess of the four Jay goalies. Billy<br />\nPowell has looked especially outstanding in'the two triumphs. When he is replaced, little is sacrificed because<br />\nof the high caliber of the reserves, Pete Banker, Emmet<br />\nCollins, and Newton Kidd.\u2022<br />\nA suggestion: watch and enjoy the Hopkins defense<br />\ntomorrow.

Since we<br />\nhadn't been to Cuba over the vacation, we wanted to<br />\nshield our distinctive and carefully cultivated pallor from<br />\nthe sun's rays and thus avoid acquiring an ignominiously<br />\nhealthy tint. While loitering in a mossy corner, we observed an equally mossy student scurry from his room and<br />\nstride out of the building without noticing us as he passed.<br />\nHis briefcase was overflowing and his face showed an<br />\ningrained anxiety which was not at all in concurrence with<br />\nour concept of the collegiate ideal. Wondering what motivated such an obviously non-acceptable type, we visited<br />\nhis neighbors, who were discussing the most casual way of<br />\nlighting a pipe. They laughed when we mentioned their<br />\nfellow student and congratulated us at having seen him<br />\nout of his room.<br />\n\"A real troll,\" said one. \"He studies all the time.<br />\nShouldn't be in this school. All night long he studies and<br />\nhe still doesn't pass. He's a real zero.\"<br />\nThe speaker's roommate, having successfully lighted<br />\nhis pipe, was aloof.<br />\n\"He went to some New England prep school which<br />\nI never heard of. He couldn't have gotten the marks to get<br />\nin here if his old man hadn't paid a tutor to drill the<br />\nstuff through his skull. His old man wants him to be a<br />\ndoctor.\"<br />\n\"I take analytics with him. This is a real gut. I<br />\nstudied for-two hours for the last test and got an eightytwo. This kid studied for a week and still failed. The<br />\ninstructor hates his guts. All be does is ask these stupid<br />\nquestions. He sits right in front of class and all the time<br />\nhe's asking questions. Now the-instructor just ignores the<br />\nkid. He's hopeless. He's got this tremendous filing system.<br />\nThe instructor belches, even, he classifies it. And then,<br />\nthis is rare, he can't find it. He'll make a good doctor.<br />\nYou'd think he'd take the hint. His advisor keeps telling<br />\nhim he's got to get his marks up or he'll flunk out.\"<br />\n\"He's a real pain. All the time he's hanging around<br />\nwith these corny jokes. I can't tolerate the kid. Last night<br />\nwe fixed him. He went down to the john last night and<br />\nwhile he was gone, we took his notes and put the ashes<br />\nof some blank papers in their place. He can't even take<br />\na joke. When he got back, he didn't say anything, just<br />\nlooked for a minute and slammed the door.<br />\n\"He was almost crying. \u2022He's really out of it,\" said<br />\nthe aloof one who was now practicing his pipe lighting in<br />\nfront of the mirror.<br />\n\"He's had it though,\" said the first:\"On that analytics<br />\ntest, I saw him looking at this other guy's paper. Now I<br />\ncan't take cheating. I nudged the guy next to me, and this<br />\nkid, who's real gung ho, announced that the test was under<br />\nthe Honor System.<br />\nThis stopped him until just before the end of the test.<br />\nHe got real nervous and started looking around again.<br />\nBy now I had three other guys watching him, and we<br />\nreally got him.<br />\n\"Guilty? Sure he's guilty. We watched him cheat.<br />\nThere's no doubt about it. The Honor Commission will<br />\ntake care of him. After all that's what it's for, isn't it?<br />\nTo take care of guys. who don't belong here ?\"<br />\nThe sun finally went behind a cloud, so we took advantage of our opportunity.<br /><br />\n\u2014ZEGER<br /><br />\nDR.

Eisenhower, the i'esults of<br />\npresent efforts along these lines<br />\nhas not been made public.<br />\n\u2022<br />\nLynn Poole, publicity director<br />\nfor the Hopkins, feels that the<br />\ncommittee's report will not be<br />\nforthcoming \"for quite some<br />\ntime yet ... early in the fall, I'd<br />\nsay.\" Until that time, it will not<br />\nbe possible to gain access to the<br />\ninformation on the work which<br />\nhas been done.<br />\nFaculty Response<br />\nWhat will happen once the<br />\nreport of the committee is made<br />\npublic Dean Shaffer did not wish<br />\nto say. \"There is,\" he said, \"(a)<br />\ncertainty that the faculty in<br />\ngeneral would like to have more<br />\nwork in 'social relations' somewhere on the campus.\"<br />\nAside from lack finances<br />\navailable for the support of another department at Homewood,<br />\nDean Shaffer pointed to a general lack of agreement among the<br />\ninterested members of the faculty as to \"where the emphasis<br />\nshould be placed.\"<br /><br />\nThree specific academic fields<br />\nin which this \"emphasis\" could<br />\nbe concentrated are 'Social<br />\ntheory, cultural anthropology,<br />\nand demography,\" the Dean stated; the establishment of a department in \"social relations\"<br />\nwould necessitate a general degree of accord among the present faculty as to the specific<br />\nemphasis.<br />\n\"We have talked from time to<br />\ntime about having more people<br />\nin these areas,\" Dean Shaffer<br />\nsaid in reference to the three<br />\nnamed above, \"\u2014not necessarily<br />\na department, but having more<br />\npeople in those fields,\" he stated,<br />\nemphasizing the point.<br />\nClarifying the position of the<br />\nUniversity in respect to the absence of specialization in those<br />\nareas, the Dean continued that<br />\n\"Hopkins makes no effort of a<br />\npretense to cover all fields .. .<br />\nWe just assert that what we do<br />\ncover, we do well.\"<br />\nFields Well Covered<br />\nBy way of contrast, he noted<br />\nthat many of the \"larger\"<br />\nschooLs claim to be ''quite<br />\nthorough in their academic<br />\ncoverage, but few of them can<br />\nclaim to cover all of their fields<br />\nas well as we cover all of ours.<br />\n\"There are a whole lot of<br />\nthings that we don't cover at<br />\nHopkins\u2014'social relations' is just<br />\none of them\u2014 ,which we would<br />\nlike to include (jn our curriculum); but our finances will not<br />\npermit it .. . So we stick to the<br />\nidea of what we do cover, we<br />\ncover well.\"<br />\nDean Shaffer noted, however,<br />\nthat facilities are presently<br />\navailable for undergraduate work<br />\nin the general field of \"social<br />\nrelations.\" He pointed to the<br />\nlibraries and faculty members<br /><br />\nFor My Ned Act<br />\n,\u201e<br /><br />\n\u2022<br /><br />\n\u2022<br /><br />\ndoing the \"necessary work\"<br />\nin the Political Science, Political<br />\nEconomy, History, and Psychology departments. An advanced<br />\ndegree, however, would be \"another matter.\"<br />\nIn conclusion, Dean Shaffer<br />\nagain noted the desire among<br />\nthe members of the faculty for<br />\nwork in ''social theory:\" but he<br />\nalso pointed again to others of<br />\nhis previous statements: \"If we<br />\nsat down, we could make a list<br />\nof the fields that we don't cover.<br />\nI believe it is true, however, that<br />\nthe field which has come UP<br />\nmost often in our faculty discussions is social theory.\"<br />\nAngell's View<br />\nTurning to the more specific,<br />\nwe visited Professor Robert C.<br />\nAngell, Resident Deiches Lecturer in Social Relations this semester. Professor Angell is 3<br />\nmember of the faculty of the<br />\nUniversity of Michigan, and was<br />\nchairman af that school's Sociology Department from 19401952.<br />\nWhen we asked him specifically \"What is Sociology?\" Pr\u00b0fesSor Angell drew a parallel,<br />\nrather than provide us with a<br />\nfinite meaning.<br />\n\"Just as economy has as its<br />\ncore the study of the phenomenon of wealth,\" he said, \"and the<br />\nPolitical scientist is interested in<br />\npower, the sociologist is cancerfled with what you might call<br />\nsolidarity\u2014or loyalty\u2014relations<br />\nin life . . . That's about mY<br />\n'stock' answer,\" he commented'<br />\nExpanding this point further,<br />\nProfessor Angell went on to saY<br />\n\"We (the sociologists) are concerned with studies of grouPs t\u20221,3<br />\nwhich we belong because we feel<br />\nthe need to belong ... Men are<br />\nsocial animals\u2014they don't join<br />\ngroups (just) for power to be<br />\ngained . . .

Sociology is the studY<br />\n,<br />\nof what is left (to the social<br />\nstructure) after the materials 01<br />\nthe related areas are deducted-which leaves a great deal!\"<br />\nThere is, however, another<br />\nview of the nature and function<br />\nof sociology which Professor An'<br />\ngell noted. \"This is the French<br />\nview,\" he stated, \"which holds<br />\nthat sociology is the general social science of which political<br />\nscience and economics are<br />\nbranches\u2014that sociology is the<br />\ndominant integrating discipline<br />\nin the social sciences.\"<br />\nThe American view, however,<br />\nis \"less inclusive . . .

The unit of Walt Mitchell, John McNealy, and Bob Edwards held the Yale squad shotless for<br />\nthirteen minutes and then hamstringed the Cavalier offense throughout the game. This unit possess both speed<br />\nand ruggedness and any attack unit will have great difficulty finding the scoring range against them.<br />\nNot to be overlooked when looking for reasons for the<br />\nJay success are the prowess of the four Jay goalies.
