At most schools,<br />\nthe class answers, 'Good<br />\nmorning.' At Columbia, the class<br />\nanswers, 'Fuck you.' At Cornell,<br />\nwhen the professor says, `Good<br />\nmorning, class', they write it<br />\ndown.\"<br />\n--Cornell freshman<br />\nHa Ha. Ha. That is too close to<br />\nwhat is true at most colleges to<br />\nbe really funny. Especially at the<br />\nCornell School of Hotel<br />\nAdministration. Which is called<br />\nthe Hotel School by people at<br />\nCornell. People who got to the<br />\nHotel School are called this.<br />\nliotelies.' There you go.<br />\nRemember this:<br />\nTwo Sundays ago I went to<br />\nCornell. With my sister. And one<br />\nof her friends. And her<br />\nroommate. And another friend<br />\nwho was driving. Cornell is in<br />\nIthaca, in a state called New<br />\nYork, which everybody reading<br />\nthis has heard of. Ithaca is fifty<br />\nmiles from civilization, in the<br />\nhinterlands of New York.<br />\nRumors that civilization exists at<br />\nCornell are quickly quashed.<br />\nIt takes about six hours to go<br />\nfrom Cockeysville, Maryland,<br />\nWhere I live, to Ithaca, where<br />\nCornell University lives. Now my<br />\nsister lives there too. Six hours in<br />\nan LTD. A person named Rick<br />\nwas driving. He did an admirable<br />\njob. Margaret sat in the front seat<br />\nand coughed most of the way. I<br />\nthink she felt sick, but \u2022 she<br />\nlooked fine and conversed in a<br />\nlovely soft voice. My sister, her<br />\nroommate, and the Kid sat in the<br />\nback seat. My sister is called<br />\nJeannine, and her roommate is<br />\nknown as Donna. Both of them<br />\ntalked and joked on the trip to<br />\nIthaca.<br />\nWhen Flash Bazbo's<br />\nspaceship shrunk to walnut size<br />\nlily sister guffawed.\"Maybe now<br />\nhe can fit into a Junior Petite.\"<br />\nThere you go.<br />\nRural,<br />\nunpolluted Pennsylvania is not<br />\nvery sophisticated. Maybe that is<br />\nWhy it is unpolluted. Riding to<br />\nIthaca, we heard on the radio a<br />\nsong with this name.\"Don't Fear<br />\nthe Combine,\" by the Eleven<br />\nThirty Shuttle. We saw -towns<br />\nWith names like McAdoo,<br />\nFrackville, Moosic, and Bungalo.<br />\nWe got out of there in a hurry.<br />\nWe stopped at a McDonald's in<br />\nW ilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania.<br />\nSteven Muller invented<br />\nMcDonald's to get revenge on<br />\nCornell for trading him to<br />\nHopkins. He gets that revenge by<br />\na ssaulting students' digestive<br />\ntracts on their way back to<br />\nC ornell. I got caught in the<br />\ncrossfire.<br />\nused to work at a<br />\nm cDonald's. So when we were<br />\nthere in Wilkes-Barre I knew not<br />\nto buy the food that people<br />\ncooked. Like quarter-pounders,<br />\nBig Macs, and french fries. Pies,<br />\nShakes, and coffee are okay. This<br />\nIS why.<br />\nWorking at McDonald's<br />\ngets dull pretty quickly. So<br />\nM cEmployees often amuse<br />\nthemselves by cooking food in<br />\nunusual ways. Like standing on a<br />\nhamburger to make it well done.<br />\nAnd so on.<br />\nAt my sister's dormitory I met<br />\neveryone she lives with. I felt like<br />\n<br />\nMiss Sally on `Romper\u2022Room.'<br />\nHere's why. I saw Dale and<br />\nBella and Della and Ella and<br />\nRhonda, Joanne and Sandy and<br />\nDarlene, Duane and Roy, Neal<br />\nand Mary and Alicia. Chris and<br />\nRobert, Don and Lucy and Scott.<br />\nNancy and Beth and Bob. I did<br />\nnot know what to say to these<br />\nswarms of collegiates, so I said<br />\n'hello'. Hello.<br />\nBig. Rip, puff. What is Cornell<br />\nthat Hopkins isn't? In the<br />\ncountry. Rip, puff. Where is<br />\nCornell that Hopkins is not? That<br />\nis Carnak the Magnificent telling<br />\nabout Cornell and Johns<br />\nHopkins. Camak is really Johnny<br />\nCarson in disguise. Almost<br />\neverything about Cornell and<br />\nHopkins is the same. Hi Ho.<br />\nDonna's psychology professor<br />\nwas telling his students about all<br />\nthe evidence against smoking<br />\ncancer sticks. He said this. \"I<br />\nused to smoke.\" Someone asked<br />\n\"Smoke what?\" Everybody<br />\nlaughed and the professor turned<br />\nred. He did not answer for a<br />\nwhile. Then / he dismissed the<br />\nremark curtly. Instead of saying<br />\n\"Remark, you may leave\" he said<br />\n\"Never mind.\" Everybody<br />\nlaughed some more.<br />\nMy friend Mickey is smart. He<br />\nsmokes candy cigarettes. When I<br />\nreturned from Cornell, he asked<br />\nme if there were a lot of wanton<br />\nwomen in Ithaca. Not really, I<br />\nreplied. He said this. That's too<br />\nbad. Because I want one! Ha Ha.<br />\nHa.<br />\nThe Cornell campus is very<br />\nbeautiful. Part of this beauty<br />\nbelongs to the girls there. Many<br />\nof them are imported from Long<br />\nIsland. \"Hell000h, Betty,\" I said<br />\nto one of the girls there. Part of<br />\nthe beauty belongs to the Gorge.<br />\nThe Gorge is a big hole in the<br />\nground where a skinny river<br />\nruns through Cornell. When the<br />\nriver jumps over rocks, it makes<br />\nsome nice waterfalls. A couple of<br />\nstudents plunge to their death at<br />\nthe Gorge each year. For that<br />\nreason, fucking up an exam is<br />\ncalled 'gorging out'. The view of<br />\nthe gorge from the bridge by the<br />\nPancake House is gorgeous. There<br />\nyou go.<br />\nDonna called me up, at my<br />\ninsistence, and said one morning,<br />\n\"Let's eat at the Pancake<br />\nHouse.\" \"Okay\" I said. The<br />\npancakes there were pretty good.<br />\n\"Why don't you have some<br />\nmore,\" she suggested. \"Your<br />\nsister said you have a huge<br />\nappetite.\" \"Yeah, and I eat a lot<br />\ntoo,\" I quipped. Donna smiled<br />\nfeebly. She was all spiffed up<br />\nthat morning to see the Dean<br />\nabout dropping some courses.<br />\nShe cooed in jest. \"Oooh, Kid,<br />\nyou don't know how tough it is<br />\nto be without brains. Any Dude<br />\nmajor will tell you. I think I'll<br />\ntransfer to Florida State and<br />\nmajor in suntan.\" \"Hang in<br />\nthere,\" I said. Hang in there.<br />\nJoanne has her head screwed<br />\non straighter. \"Mum! There's a<br />\ndead bishop on the landing!\" she<br />\nused to joke. \"What's 'is<br />\ndiocese?\" I used to ask. \"How<br />\nshould I know?\" she used to<br />\nwhine. \"It's tatooed on the back<br />\nof 'is neck,\" I used to answer. We<br />\ndo this no longer, though I wish<br />\nwe could. Joanne drowned on a<br />\n<br />\nmarshmallow recently. So it goes.<br />\nThere is a bell tower at Cornell<br />\nrun by people full of bad<br />\nchemicals. They torture the<br />\nstudents by playing \"Have You<br />\nNever Been Mellow\" and \"A<br />\nHard Rain's Gonna Fall\"<br />\nconsecutively on the chimes. One<br />\ntime I was walking back from<br />\nHelen Newman Hall where on of<br />\nmy sister's friends was supposed<br />\nto meet her on a field hockey bus<br />\nfrom Bucknell. Can't you meet<br />\non any old field hockey bus? I<br />\nwisecracked. The dreaded chimes<br />\nstarted playing. Have some candy<br />\ncorn, my sister said. Don't mind<br />\nif I do, I replied. Don't minc'if I<br />\ndo.<br />\nOne of Joanne's better albums<br />\nis called \"Changesone\". By David<br />\nBowie.

Three tables of horny<br />\nyoung Cornellians sat down<br />\nimmediately next to us. Could be<br />\ntense. Donna got a Harvey<br />\nWallbanger, and the Kid an<br />\nunknown quantity called a Hop,<br />\nSkip, and Go Naked. I didn't hop<br />\nand skip.<br />\nWe retired to the dorm for<br />\n;ome midweek community<br />\n)artying. Pass the tequila. Roy<br />\nsaid. Sure. He poured some into a<br />\nglass gingerly. Orange juice<br />\nfollowed the tequila. What about<br />\nthe grenadine? some wiseass<br />\nasked me later. This is what I<br />\nsaid. How can anyone expect to<br />\nbuy grenadine in the Noyes<br />\nStudent Center Mini-Pick Up? In<br />\nyour ear, Billy-Willy.<br />\nSome of the people that go to<br />\nschool at Cornell seem obsessed<br />\nwith grades, exams, and other<br />\nmeasures of academic<br />\nachievement. These students<br />\nmade a guest appearance in the<br />\ncomic strip Doonesbury not long<br />\nago. Along wish some Hopkins<br />\nstudents. A krofessor lectured<br />\nfervently. \"What do we have,<br />\nclass, when a deep knowledge of<br />\nthe law is tempered by a strong<br />\nsense of morality?\" \"Class?. Sandy and Donna requested<br />\nthat I write this. \"Can a Canuck<br />\nfuck?\"<br />\n\"Eats.\" The sign beckoned.<br />\n\"Bette and Juniors Bar and<br />\nGrill.\" I hear that Junior's just a<br />\nthavage, Donna lisps. My mind<br />\ndrifted ahead to thoughts of the<br />\nWar Memorial Colonnade. Steam<br />\nissues from manholes in the<br />\nsidewalk. On a foggy night the<br />\nscene is eerie. Gothic singers<br />\nwade out in long robes to sing<br />\nthe Cornell song. \"High Above<br />\nCayuga's Waters,\" it is called.<br />\nAfter the performance they pass<br />\nthe hood. And so it goes.<br />\nOne Cornell freshman, with a<br />\nsnuffly Al Pacino voice, said this.<br />\n\"Cornell is cut off from the<br />\nworld. We never get holidays!\". I<br />\nprodded. \"No holidays?\" Ile said<br />\nthis. \"If the president of the<br />\nuniversity were killed tomorrow,<br />\nnot only wouldn't we get a day<br />\noff, but we would have to go to a<br />\nseminar on his death.\" So it goes.<br />\nThe bus ride home is long,<br />\nbrutish, and nasty.

She talks to one of the<br />\nbusdrivers 10,r sonic twenty<br />\nminutes. The bus driver is slumped<br />\nlike Ralph Kramden.

It had a<br />\nreason for not supplying the<br />\naction-packed coverage which<br />\nshould have been forthcoming<br />\nfrom a race which, though not<br />\nclose (Beall lost by 18 percentage<br />\npoints) could not fail to be<br />\ncolorful by way of its pitting of a<br />\nstaunch conservative against the<br />\nnearly consummate liberal,<br />\nSarbanes, a Democrat's Democrat<br />\nwho had no use for Beall or his<br />\nties with the now fallen Nixon<br />\nregime. The latter had gained<br />\nnational recognition from<br />\ndelivering the initial article of<br />\nimpeachment against Nixon.<br />\nThe Sun's unpublicized reason<br />\nwas that it felt it had payed Beall<br />\nan injustice during the summer in<br />\nan attempt to uncover<br />\ninterest-conflicting ties he had<br />\nwith a Western Maryland<br />\nInsurance Company. When<br />\nreporter Richard Ben Cramer,<br />\none of the paper's top journalists<br />\nand a former editor of the<br />\nHopkins News-Letter, included a<br />\nfew erroneous facts in a story,<br />\nthe Sun felt that they certainly<br />\nhad wrongly screwed Beall to the<br />\nwall.

The reporting<br />\nwould have had to have been<br />\nmuch worse than it was to have<br />\nshifted the outcome.

The<br />\ndirector, age 35, is a former<br />\ncritic. He has taken George<br />\nSimenon's novel The Clockmaker<br />\nof Everton, assembled a<br />\nprofessional crew, and made a<br />\nvery fine movie. Tavernier wrote<br />\nthe script in conjunction with<br />\ntwo veteran screenwriters\u2014Jean<br />\nAurenche and Pierre Bost,<br />\nwho've been working together<br />\nsince the1940's. Their script for<br />\nRene Clement's 1952 film<br />\n\"Forbidden Games\" explored the<br />\neffects of war on a small girl who<br />\nmust come to terms with the<br />\ndeath of her parents. The insights<br />\ninto character were acute and<br />\noften subtle, but these men were<br />\ndilegently hammering themes<br />\ninto our heads, and as a result<br />\n\"Forbidden Games\" remains one<br />\nof the French cinema's most<br />\npowerful representations of the<br />\neffects of WWII on the French<br />\npeople. The script for \"The<br />\nClockmaker\" is similar in that<br />\npsychological nuances<br />\naccumulate. The audience is<br />\ncaught up in the pattern, and by<br />\nthe end of the film we are led to<br />\ncondone a murder.<br />\nPhilippe Noiret portrays a<br />\nmiddle-aged clockmaker. We see<br />\nhim eating and playing with his<br />\nfriends. His laughter and good<br />\nnature are infectious. These<br />\nopening minutes are an example<br />\nof what the French film often<br />\ndoes so well. What other national<br />\ncinema has made the preparation<br />\nand consumption of food such a<br />\njoyful event? I think an entire<br />\nfilm could be made depicting<br />\nnothing but a soiree, because the<br />\nFrench film excells in the<br />\ndepiction of small groups of<br />\nTomorrow evening, at 8:30,<br />\npianist Radu Lupu will open the<br />\nhighly acclaimed Shriver Hall<br />\nConcert Series. The series, which<br />\ntends to the intimacy of chamber<br />\nrecitals rather than the distance<br />\nof the orchestral concert hall,<br />\ncontinues in its tradition of<br />\nexcellence, offering some of the<br />\nbest musical talent available to<br />\nBaltimore concert goers.<br />\nRadu Lupu is without<br />\nquestion one of the finest of the<br />\nyoung pianists, enjoying a<br />\nreputation easily on par with<br />\nsuch artists as Stephen Bishop,<br />\nMurray Perahia, and Maurizio<br />\nPollini. (It is interesting to note<br />\nthat both Pollini and Perahia<br />\nhave played in the Shriver Series<br />\nwithin the last three years.)<br />\nIle has recorded extensively<br />\nfor the London label, one of his<br />\nmost recent recordings being the<br />\nBrahms Piano Concerto No. 2.<br />\nwith Lorin Maazel and the<br />\nCleveland Symphony. He plays<br />\nstrongly in a romantic -style.<br />\nspecializing in such composers as<br />\nSchuman, Brahms. Schubert, and<br />\nGrieg.<br />\nWith a divine mixture youthful<br />\ntire and mature restraint, his<br />\ninterpretations bristle with<br />\nvivacity and excitement; he is a<br />\npianist who wears well with the<br />\nintimacy of a chamber concert. It<br />\nis like listening to an avid.<br />\n<br />\nfriends eating. playing, and<br />\nloving. The depth of character<br />\nanalysis and the complexity of<br />\nhuman relationships is something<br />\nlacking from most American<br />\nfilms, for our filmmakers have<br />\nalways found their strength in<br />\naction, suspense, spectacle, and<br />\nscrewball comedy.<br />\n1-iere we have a normal<br />\ngathering of friends. There is no<br />\ngreat white shark lurking nearby.<br />\nNone of the characters has a<br />\nMagnum tucked in his belt, nor is<br />\nLucille Ball getting stuck in a<br />\nchimney. The French film can<br />\nmake depictions of the mundane<br />\na joy to watch (as in \"Vincent.<br />\nFrancois, Paul and the Others\".)<br />\nAnd what do these complacent<br />\nmiddle class men talk about? One<br />\nsays, \"France is going to the<br />\ndogs,\" but their discussion of<br />\ncapital punishment is no more<br />\nthan cheerful banter:<br />\n\"Executions will be televised in<br />\nprime time before the sitcoms.\"<br />\nIt all seems harmless enough. The<br />\nclockmaker is a man so<br />\nconscientious in his obedience of<br />\nthe law that he refuses to walk<br />\nacross an empty street until the<br />\nlight changes: \"I like to be legal.\"<br />\nAfter all, what does a clockmaker<br />\nand repairer do? Doesn't he keep<br />\nour clocks\u2014and by extension our<br />\nlives\u2014in orderly motion? He<br />\nhelps society to run smoothly,<br />\npredictably.<br />\nThis social complacency is<br />\nexactly what Tavernier is<br />\nattacking. There are ugly currents<br />\nbeneath the calm surface. The<br />\nnext morning, as the clockmaker<br />\nis dutifully opening up his shop,<br />\na police car pulls up, and he is<br />\ntaken away. On the car radio can<br />\nbe heard a jazz score, a soft<br />\nvoice: \"80% of the French<br />\n<br />\nenergetic conversationalist who<br />\nknows his topics well.<br />\nOn the concert bill are the<br />\nSonata Number Eight (Opus 13),<br />\nthe Pathetique Sonata of<br />\nBeethoven; Bela Barok's \"Out of<br />\nDoors\" Suite; and the Schubert<br />\nSonata in B flat.<br />\nVaried, though with a<br />\npronounced Romanticist bent,<br />\nthese pieces cover a wide realsm<br />\nin of European Piano Literature.<br />\nThe Beethoven. turbulent and<br />\ntragic, is no doubt well known to<br />\nmost listeners.

And you?\"<br />\nNoiret is told that his son has<br />\nkilled a man. When the officer<br />\nasks him to fasten his safety belt<br />\nhe asks listlessly: \"Why?\" As<br />\nNoiret is questioned by a police<br />\nbureaucracy he slowly begins to<br />\nreject conventions, to question<br />\neverything.<br />\nThe police realize he had no<br />\nknowledge of his son's crime, but<br />\nstill warn him to not leave town.<br />\nNoiret's face is remarkable in its<br />\nability to show confusion,<br />\ndisillusionment, a tired blankness<br />\nof expression: \"I can't think<br />\nstraight.\" Police and a bourgeois<br />\npress harass him. The _police<br />\ninspector (Jean Rochefort) is a<br />\nman of about the same age, and<br />\nhe also has a son. An interesting<br />\nrelationship develops between<br />\nthe two men._ The police<br />\ninspector says: \"If you don't<br />\nunderstand your own kids you<br />\ntry other people's.\" But Noiret<br />\nhas never really understood his<br />\nown son: \"Words don't have the<br />\nsame meaning between us<br />\nanymore.\" Society is running<br />\nsmoothly, the investigation<br />\nproceeds methodically, the<br />\ninspector and the clockmaker get<br />\n<br />\nTwentieth-Century stylistic<br />\nframework. And the Schubert<br />\nSonata is a pure delight, deftly<br />\nmixing form and line into a most<br />\nexquisite musical package.<br />\nAs if the mere listing of the<br />\nconcert agenda and artist were<br />\nnot enough, there are extra<br />\nreasons fro the Hopkins student<br />\nto attend the series. Not only is<br />\nthe Concert to be held on<br />\ncampus. but the intimacies of<br />\nShriver Hall virtually guarantee a<br />\ngood seat anywhere.<br />\nFurthermore. student tickets are<br />\neasily obtained, and run a mere<br />\n$2.00.<br />\n--J.D.

His son is a criminal,<br />\nmay be shot on sight, and has<br />\ndisrupted the order of society,<br />\nbut he is still his son\u2014even<br />\nthough they never really knew<br />\none another: \"He didn't talk to<br />\nme.

Razon, the man killed,<br />\nwas a factory policeman who had<br />\nattacked many girls, including<br />\nthe son's girlfriend.

Bourgeois society<br />\namuses itself. At the murder site<br />\nNoiret observes a family posing<br />\nfor photographs.<br />\nThe son is arrested. Noiret, no<br />\nlonger complacent, questions the<br />\ninspector: \"Did you torture<br />\nhim?\" The inspector laughs this<br />\noff. Society is too civilized:<br />\n\"Bloody faces and dirty clubs.<br />\nThat's just the movies...We hit<br />\nthem with phone books. It leaves<br />\nno mark.\" Cruelty is well<br />\npackaged, made legal, proper.

You want to<br />\nfind some excuse to believe it really didn't happen exactly<br />\nthe way the story is being told. After all, that kind of thing<br />\ndoesn't happen here in the U.S. of A., the home of the free<br />\nand open Presidential elections. At least that's that way you<br />\nrationalize it. You don't want to acknowledge what<br />\nhappened to them, because if you<br />\ndo, you have to throw<br />\nout all those secure feelings you have on D level in the library<br />\nor around the waterpipe in your room.<br />\nAre these kinds of security the full extent of freedom of<br />\nthought?<br />\nThe Student Council is to be commended this time for<br />\ntheir coming out in support of Ceci and Pione. The decision<br />\nto emphasize community relations in this case is a healthy<br />\nstance, long overdue from several segments of the Hopkins<br />\ncommunity. Too many undergraduates pass through their<br />\nfour years here with a high-powered degree and a crippled<br />\nsocial sensibility.<br />\nAn excellent start for all of us ivory tower isolationists<br />\nwould be to take time to attend the benefit for the Baltimore<br />\n2 tomorrow night at Bread and Roses. It will probably be a<br />\nmildly shocking experience, because people hope to talk<br />\nabout more than this particular case. Don't try to kid<br />\nyourself that theirs is an isolated occurence. There are too<br />\nmany such \"incidents\" being spoken of these days.<br />\n<br />\nletters to the editor<br />\nTo the Editor:<br />\nI take great exception to the<br />\nletter from Daniel D. Wile<br />\npublished in the October 26<br />\nNews-Letter concerning your<br />\narticle on Daniel Ellsberg's<br />\nappearance at Hopkins.<br />\nIn attacking the News-Letter's<br />\n\"disturbingly narrow-minded<br />\nnaive liberal bias,\" Mr. Wile<br />\nbetrays his own bias by<br />\nchallenging us to<br />\n\"remember that Dr. Ellsberg<br />\nbroke the law and many<br />\nconfidences, both grave forms of<br />\ndishonor.\" Without wishing to<br />\nconfuse Mr. Wile with facts, I<br />\nmight point out that Dr. Ellsberg,.<br />\nto my knowledge, has yet to be<br />\nconvicted of any violation of the<br />\nlaw with regards to his release of<br />\nthe Pentagon Papers.<br />\nFurthermore, it is a strange logic<br />\nthat characterizes as dishonorable<br />\nthe efforts of someone to expose<br />\nthe lies perpetrated upon the<br />\nAmerican people by their<br />\ngovernment. If this be dishonor.<br />\nthen let us encourage similar<br />\nforms of dishonor among our<br />\npublic officials.<br />\n<br />\nfr<br />\n<br />\nMr. Wile accuses your reporter<br />\nof slandering the Administration<br />\nby reporting President Muller's<br />\nrefusal to meet with the<br />\nContinental Walkers about<br />\nHopkins' sponsorship of the<br />\nmilitary oriented Applied Physics<br />\nLab. Mr. Wile feels that Dr.<br />\nMuller ought to have equal time.<br />\nEqual to what? Members of the<br />\nCommittee for the Conversion of<br />\nthe Applied Physics Lab have<br />\nbeen trying for months to<br />\narrange a public forum at A.P.L.<br />\nto discuss the University's<br />\ncontinued complicity there. It is<br />\nthe Administration that<br />\ncontinues to refuse.<br />\nMr. Wile also seems to support<br />\nthe paradoxical thinking of the<br />\ndefense establishment that the<br />\nroad to security lies in emulating<br />\nthe behavior of those countries<br />\nwe call our enemies. Dr. Ellsberg<br />\nbelonged to that same defense<br />\nestablishment until he realized, as<br />\nmany other citizens of the world<br />\nnow realize, that none of us is<br />\nsecure as long as the imminent<br />\nthreat of.nuclear destruction, by<br />\naccident or design, remains.<br />\nGerry Gaeng<br />\n<br />\nAsylum?<br />\n<br />\nAn angry reply to Mr. Blizzard<br />\nAs something of a<br />\nself-appointed nuisance, I think it<br />\nincumbent upon me to respond<br />\nto Keith Blizzard's letter in a<br />\nrecent issue of the News-Letter.<br />\nSo...<br />\nMr. Blizzard's views are a very<br />\ngood example of what every gay<br />\nmust deal with before he can<br />\naccept himself. The word is<br />\n\"prejudice.\" and it is obvious<br />\nfrom the letter in question that,<br />\nas in all matters of this sort, some<br />\npretty strong emotions are<br />\ninvolved.<br />\nAs soon as I began reading the<br />\nletter I knew this was not going<br />\nto be nice; \"Last year when<br />\nHopkins began providing an<br />\nasylum for the Gay Caucus, I,<br />\nlike the majority of the student<br />\nbody, maintained an unbias (sic)<br />\nconsensus of opinion. Although<br />\nthis activity shocked my inherent<br />\nmorals I excused it as another<br />\nliberal experiment on the part of<br />\nthe university.\"<br />\nAn asylum. That's just what<br />\nwe don't want. We've had<br />\nasylums. Perhaps Mr. Blizzard<br />\nwants to reinstitute aversion<br />\ntherapy and prefrontal<br />\nlobotomies. Those are two very<br />\neffective ways to deal with<br />\nhomosexuality. And they're such<br />\nhumane ways of doing it too.<br />\nYou didn't have to be crazy to be<br />\ninstitutionalized in the good old<br />\ndays. Homosexuality was often<br />\ngood enough cause.<br />\nAsylum. We don't want that<br />\neither. We simply want to be<br />\naccepted as functional<br />\nconstructive members of this<br />\nsociety. There is no reason why<br />\nwe should need asylum. As it is, I<br />\ndefy you to find a major social,<br />\npolitical, or religious institution<br />\nwhich offers it to us. Gays are<br />\nlucky to. get an unbiased<br />\nreception, which is obviously<br />\nsomething Mr. Blizzard was not<br />\nprepared to give us, despite what<br />\nhe says about an \"unbias<br />\nconsensus-of opinion,\" whatever<br />\nthat may mean.<br />\nThe fact that Mr. Blizzard's<br />\n\"inherent morals\" were shocked<br />\nand that he feels that the<br />\nuniversity must be \"excused\" for<br />\nthe Caucus makes it very plain<br />\nthat he views homosexuals in the<br />\nlight of some very unkind and<br />\noften false stereotypes. I<br />\nunderstand this. I've got my own<br />\nproblems with .stereotypes, but I<br />\ntry my best to look at the real<br />\npeople in spite of them. As a<br />\nreasonably intelligent and<br />\nhopefully somewhat enlightened<br />\nhuman being, I must do this; it is<br />\nobligatory.<br />\nMr. Blizzard evidently doesn't<br />\nknow it, but he hit upon the<br />\nright answer in his letter: \"Our<br />\nfirst response was one of<br />\nlaughter, thinking there must be<br />\na costume party on campus.\"<br />\nThe Caucus' dance was a<br />\nHalloween dance, and the<br />\npublicity for it included the<br />\nphrase \"costume optional.\"<br />\nThat's why there were men in<br />\nwomen's clothing on campus.<br />\nThere were also men dressed as<br />\nRoman centurions.<br />\n\". . .then my stomach turned<br />\nas the truth of the situation<br />\ndawned on me.\" This doesn't<br />\nsound very unbiased to me. The<br />\nsituation Mr. Blizzard refers to<br />\nwas nothing more or less than a<br />\ndance. Is there any reason why<br />\n<br />\ngays should be denied the social<br />\nactivity of a dance'? I certainly<br />\nhaven't come across one. What is<br />\nall the fuss about? I can see Mr.<br />\nBlizzard being upset if he<br />\nwitnessed an homosexual orgy or<br />\neven perhaps if he had observed a<br />\npublic display of<br />\naffection\"\u2014does his stomach<br />\nturn every time he sees a man<br />\nand a woman kissing?\u2014but a few<br />\nstrays from the dance do not<br />\nseem adequate cause' for his<br />\nindignation.<br />\nI will not deny that there are<br />\nsome male homosexuals who<br />\nhabitually wear women's<br />\nclothing\u2014the colloquial<br />\nexpression for them is \"drag<br />\nqueens.\" I won't even say that<br />\nthere weren't a few of them at<br />\n.the dance; in fact, Mr. Rodrigue's<br />\npiece in the same issue of the<br />\nNews-Letter makes it obvious<br />\nthat there were. But to attack<br />\ngays as a group on the basis of<br />\nthe few atypical people Mr.<br />\nBlizzard and his friends saw is<br />\npurely irrational. Al! gays do not<br />\ngo in drag; the vast majority, in<br />\nfact, do not.<br />\n<br />\nsafe at our meetings; it you don't<br />\ntrust tts, you may depend on one<br />\nof the straights who attend our<br />\nmeetings to protect you. One<br />\nmore time\u2014the popular ideas<br />\nabout us are largely untrue, and<br />\nit's very frustrating for us to see<br />\nthem so vividly expressed as they<br />\nare in Mr. Blizzard's letter.<br />\nubjc.ct<br />\nic sm<br />\ndpouebsHocprkiitnsis<br />\nby<br />\nitselfto<br />\n.why public<br />\nproviding an asylum for the<br />\nabnormal of our society?\"<br />\ninfMorrniatBioliiizzIadrdorfetvi<br />\n. Tdoentthlye as<br />\nbest<br />\nof my knowledge, there has been<br />\nno public criticism of the<br />\nuniversity because of the Caucus'.<br />\nexistence. I'm sorry Mr. Blizzard<br />\nwas embarassed in front of his<br />\nfriends, but it could have<br />\nheppened anywhere. Drag queens<br />\nare, almost by definition, r ot<br />\nrestricted to gay dances. Those of<br />\nyou who attended the centennial<br />\nball last year may recall that<br />\nthere was a guy in drag there<br />\nmost transvestites are<br />\nnot gay).<br />\nAgain, Hopkins is not<br />\nproviding an asylum. There were<br />\ngays here long before the Caucus<br />\nwas formed; the odds are very<br />\ngood that every class has<br />\ngraduated its share of<br />\nhomosexuals. The Caucus was<br />\nformed, not to be an asylum, but<br />\nto combat the prejudices Mr.<br />\nBlizzard expresses. It is a means<br />\nby which we hope to show that<br />\n\"faggots\" and \"dykes\" are no<br />\nmore adequate generic labels<br />\nthan are \"kikes,\" \"broads\" or<br />\n<br />\n\"niggers.\"<br />\n<br />\nI'm not trying to deny that \"a<br />\nman dressed in feminine<br />\ngarments enter(ed) the ladies<br />\n(sic) room,\" although I've been<br />\ntold that it may simply have been<br />\na very masculine-looking woman.<br />\nIf the incident did happen the<br />\nway Mr. Blizzard described<br />\nit\u2014and I frankly do not doubt his<br />\nveracity\u2014it was indeed uncalled<br />\nfor. I do not approve of it.<br />\nNeither, for that matter, do I like<br />\nthe idea of going in drag. But<br />\nwhat Mr. Blizzard and his friends<br />\nsaw were the actions of a few<br />\nindividuals; to generalize and say<br />\nthis behavior is an invariable<br />\ncharacteristic of every gay male is<br />\nsimply prejudice. It is not fair to<br />\njudge us in this way.<br />\nI am not quibbling with Mr.<br />\nBlizzard's complaint; there is<br />\nindeed some legitimate basis for<br />\nit. What I am taking exception to<br />\nis the general tone of the letter.<br />\nThe gentlemen were so<br />\nunfortunate as to see what is<br />\nperhaps their most fearful<br />\nstereotype about homosexuals<br />\npersonified. But the number of<br />\ndrag queens ill relation to the<br />\ntotal number of gays is small.<br />\nThis unpleasant image is largely<br />\nunfounded. If Mr. Blizzard, or<br />\nanyone else, for that matter,<br />\nwants to give us a fair chance, he<br />\nneed merely come to a few<br />\nmeetings of the Caucus. We<br />\nencourage this; it's part of our<br />\npurpose. Your virtue is perfectly<br />\n<br />\n'Abnormal'<br />\nMy last quote from Mr.<br />\nBlizzard's letter raises that (Id<br />\nbugaboo of \"abnormal.\" WILit<br />\ndoes it mean? Need it be<br />\nreiterated tha t<br />\nhomosexuality<br />\n. \u2014althou gh<br />\nadmittedly not exclusive<br />\nhomosexuality\u2014has been<br />\nobserved in every mammal ever<br />\nused for research: cows, dogs.<br />\nrats, dolphins, monkeys. cats.<br />\netc.? Our sexuality may not be<br />\nthe \"norm'', but it is rot<br />\nabnormal ill the sense that tt<br />\ndoesn't occur in nature. If Mr.<br />\nBlizzard uses that definition. I<br />\nmust assume that he is also<br />\ntotally repulsed by women who<br />\nshave their legs.<br />\nShall I argue that t he<br />\naccoutrements of our society, if<br />\nnot our society itself, re<br />\nabnormal?

Maybe I should argue tl at<br />\nhomosexuality is a naturat<br />\nconsequence of our society.<br />\nLet's be sure our world is pure<br />\nand normal. Don't expose the<br />\nchildren to this scourge; let's<br />\nforget that no civilized count*/<br />\nhas ever had a zero incidence of<br />\nhomosexuality and that It's<br />\ndoubtful any primitive one has.<br />\nSuch may be the world r.<br />\nBlizzard inhabits\u2014a world totally<br />\nfree of even the vaguest hint. of<br />\nhomosexuality.

But as<br />\n'`drama critic': for the<br />\nNews-Letter I took up the task,<br />\nand was treated to a most<br />\nenjoyable evening.<br />\nThe play itself is beautifully<br />\nwritten, chock full of twists and<br />\nturns in the grand tradition of A<br />\nMidsummer Night's Dream. To<br />\nrelate the plot would spoil any of<br />\nthe terrific surprises, so a bare<br />\noutline of the characters will<br />\nsuffice<br />\nMr. and Mrs. Hardcastle are<br />\ntwo wealthy English folks who<br />\nlive in the country with their as<br />\nyet unmarried daughter, Kate,<br />\nand their mischievous stepson,<br />\nTony Lumpkin. Also present is<br />\nConstance Neville, Mrs.<br />\nNardcastle's niece who she is<br />\ndesperately trying to hitch up<br />\nwith Tony, who despises her.<br />\nAlso add an incompetent, but<br />\nlovable group of servants headed<br />\nby the nearly toothless Diggory,<br />\nand Pimple, a maidservant, the<br />\nonly one in the play who seems<br />\nto be aware of what is happening.<br />\nOn the scene pops Young<br />\nMarlow, a hopeful for the hand<br />\nof Kate and son of Mr.<br />\nHardcastle's old buddy, Sir<br />\nCharles Marlow, and his<br />\ncompanion, George Hastings.<br />\nBefore reaching the Hardcastle<br />\nestate, Young Marlow and<br />\nHastings stop at an in where<br />\nTony is living it up with some<br />\nfriends. And from this point on,<br />\nled by the plotting mind of<br />\n<br />\nTony, everything turns to<br />\nchaos...<br />\nStaging<br />\nGenerally the staging is tight<br />\nand imaginative, a few times<br />\nawkward, where actors are asked<br />\nto make roundabout trips around<br />\nfurniture instead of simpler,<br />\ndirect routes. The blocking and<br />\ndirection is fastpaced and often<br />\nthere are several simultanebus<br />\nactions to occupy the eye of the<br />\naudience. Twice during the<br />\nproduction, Tony Lumpkin<br />\nConstance Neville can be seen<br />\nflirting backstage, while a<br />\nconversation takes place upstage.<br />\nThe first time it appears<br />\ncontrived and rehearsed; the<br />\nsecond, spontaneous and a<br />\nbrilliant show of silent humor.<br />\nThe scene changes are innovative<br />\nand the musical interludes are<br />\nclassy and delightful. A word<br />\nabout the set design, which,<br />\nunfortunately, most of the<br />\naudience will overlook. The stage<br />\nand movable ceiling are both<br />\npainted with great detail;<br />\notherwise the set is simple and<br />\nunpretentious, yet effective and<br />\nbeautiful. Because I know very<br />\nlittle about costuming from this<br />\nera I cannot comment on its<br />\nauthenticity, although I was<br />\nextremely impressed. Some of<br />\nthe make-up seemed a little<br />\nheavy in spots, especially with<br />\nDiggory, \u2022but this is a trivial<br />\ncomment when one leafs through<br />\nthe program and realizes the<br />\namazing physical transformations<br />\nthe actors have gone through.<br />\nThe acting ranges from good<br />\nto brilliant. One of the most<br />\ndifficult aspects of wordy drama<br />\nis to make the lines sound as if<br />\nthey are not just being recited.<br />\n<br />\nPaul C. Thomas, as Mr.<br />\nHardcastle opened the show<br />\nreading his lines stiffly, but as the<br />\nplay progressed, loosened up and<br />\nwas nothing less than excellent.<br />\nHis facial expressions, so essential<br />\nto this production, were<br />\nexaggerated just to the proper<br />\npoint, and he proves to be a great<br />\ncomic talent. Michael Haney, as<br />\nTony Lumpkin, was my per.,onal<br />\nfavorite, and perhaps the best<br />\ncharacter in the written play. He<br />\nis a mischievous personality who,<br />\nnonetheless, has the audience<br />\nbehind him the whole way.<br />\nReminiscent of Malcolm<br />\nMcDowall, he has one of the<br />\nmost expressive faces I have ever<br />\nseen. It is fair to say Michael<br />\nHaney is worth the price of<br />\nadmission. Jim Boraddus as<br />\nYoung Marlow, seemed very<br />\ncomfortable in the somewhat<br />\ndifficult character transitions he's<br />\nasked to perform, and extremely<br />\ncompetent both in comic and<br />\nserious moments. Dan Diggles, as<br />\nGeorge Hastings, may be the<br />\nmost professional actor in the<br />\ncast, more subdued than Tony's<br />\npart, but equally exciting. Of all<br />\nthe performers he appears the<br />\nmost relaxed on the stage, and is<br />\nparticularly adept at playing to<br />\nall parts of the audience.<br />\nDiggory, played by Dan Szelag, is<br />\na scene stealer. Enough said.<br />\nCompetent performances by<br />\nDonna Welby as Pimple, Roland<br />\nBull as Sir Charles Marlow, and<br />\nagain as Stingo. My only<br />\ncomplaint is in the writing of the<br />\nplay, as these characters are'<br />\nrather shallow. I feel shallowness<br />\nis also a problem with Mrs.<br />\nHardcastle, played by Carol<br />\nGustafson, a though I'm not<br />\nfrInterert<br />\n<br />\nMitItMerftr5e<br />\n<br />\nsure whether this is the fault of<br />\nthe director, the writer, or Ms.<br />\nGustafson. It is still a very good<br />\nperformance, but perhaps<br />\nupstaged by the others. Tana<br />\nHicken, as Kate Hardcastle acts<br />\nbest in her maiden role; her lines<br />\nseem more forced and rehearsed<br />\nwhen she actually plays the<br />\nwealthy daughter. Her comic<br />\nlines generally do not come<br />\nacross. In a play distinctly<br />\nBritish, Christine Baranski's<br />\n(Constance Nevelle) accent<br />\nbothers me. Although her comic<br />\nactions and lines are successful,<br />\nthe majority of the time she<br />\nseems miscast. Perhaps the<br />\n<br />\nM4791/1\"rfS \u201drliSioimritit\"<br />\n<br />\nOff7frre1rIfffftqlt<br />\n<br />\ndirector needed to have spent<br />\nmore time with Tony's friends,<br />\nplayed by Caleb Childs, Tim<br />\nMcCusker, Ken Tipper and<br />\nThomas G. Waites, or again it<br />\nmay be they just fade next to<br />\nvivid<br />\nMichael Haney's<br />\nperformance.<br />\nFrom the opening scene to the<br />\ncurtain calls the play is<br />\ndelightful. And because of the<br />\nnature of the play, and a<br />\ncombination of excellent acting<br />\nand tight direction, there is truly<br />\nnever a dull moment.<br />\nShe Stoops to Conquer plays<br />\nthrough November 21, at Center<br />\nStage, 700 N.

We saw -towns<br />\nWith names like McAdoo,<br />\nFrackville, Moosic, and Bungalo.<br />\nWe got out of there in a hurry.<br />\nWe stopped at a McDonald's in<br />\nW ilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania.<br />\nSteven Muller invented<br />\nMcDonald's to get revenge on<br />\nCornell for trading him to<br />\nHopkins. He gets that revenge by<br />\na ssaulting students' digestive<br />\ntracts on their way back to<br />\nC ornell. I got caught in the<br />\ncrossfire.<br />\nused to work at a<br />\nm cDonald's. So when we were<br />\nthere in Wilkes-Barre I knew not<br />\nto buy the food that people<br />\ncooked. Like quarter-pounders,<br />\nBig Macs, and french fries. Pies,<br />\nShakes, and coffee are okay. This<br />\nIS why.<br />\nWorking at McDonald's<br />\ngets dull pretty quickly. So<br />\nM cEmployees often amuse<br />\nthemselves by cooking food in<br />\nunusual ways. Like standing on a<br />\nhamburger to make it well done.<br />\nAnd so on.<br />\nAt my sister's dormitory I met<br />\neveryone she lives with. I felt like<br /><br />\nMiss Sally on `Romper\u2022Room.'<br />\nHere's why. I saw Dale and<br />\nBella and Della and Ella and<br />\nRhonda, Joanne and Sandy and<br />\nDarlene, Duane and Roy, Neal<br />\nand Mary and Alicia. Chris and<br />\nRobert, Don and Lucy and Scott.<br />\nNancy and Beth and Bob. I did<br />\nnot know what to say to these<br />\nswarms of collegiates, so I said<br />\n'hello'. Hello.<br />\nBig. Rip, puff. What is Cornell<br />\nthat Hopkins isn't? In the<br />\ncountry. Rip, puff. Where is<br />\nCornell that Hopkins is not? That<br />\nis Carnak the Magnificent telling<br />\nabout Cornell and Johns<br />\nHopkins. Camak is really Johnny<br />\nCarson in disguise. Almost<br />\neverything about Cornell and<br />\nHopkins is the same. Hi Ho.<br />\nDonna's psychology professor<br />\nwas telling his students about all<br />\nthe evidence against smoking<br />\ncancer sticks. He said this. \"I<br />\nused to smoke.\" Someone asked<br />\n\"Smoke what?\" Everybody<br />\nlaughed and the professor turned<br />\nred. He did not answer for a<br />\nwhile. Then / he dismissed the<br />\nremark curtly. Instead of saying<br />\n\"Remark, you may leave\" he said<br />\n\"Never mind.\" Everybody<br />\nlaughed some more.<br />\nMy friend Mickey is smart. He<br />\nsmokes candy cigarettes. When I<br />\nreturned from Cornell, he asked<br />\nme if there were a lot of wanton<br />\nwomen in Ithaca. Not really, I<br />\nreplied. He said this. That's too<br />\nbad. Because I want one! Ha Ha.<br />\nHa.<br />\nThe Cornell campus is very<br />\nbeautiful. Part of this beauty<br />\nbelongs to the girls there. Many<br />\nof them are imported from Long<br />\nIsland. \"Hell000h, Betty,\" I said<br />\nto one of the girls there. Part of<br />\nthe beauty belongs to the Gorge.<br />\nThe Gorge is a big hole in the<br />\nground where a skinny river<br />\nruns through Cornell. When the<br />\nriver jumps over rocks, it makes<br />\nsome nice waterfalls. A couple of<br />\nstudents plunge to their death at<br />\nthe Gorge each year. For that<br />\nreason, fucking up an exam is<br />\ncalled 'gorging out'. The view of<br />\nthe gorge from the bridge by the<br />\nPancake House is gorgeous. There<br />\nyou go.<br />\nDonna called me up, at my<br />\ninsistence, and said one morning,<br />\n\"Let's eat at the Pancake<br />\nHouse.\" \"Okay\" I said. The<br />\npancakes there were pretty good.<br />\n\"Why don't you have some<br />\nmore,\" she suggested. \"Your<br />\nsister said you have a huge<br />\nappetite.\" \"Yeah, and I eat a lot<br />\ntoo,\" I quipped. Donna smiled<br />\nfeebly. She was all spiffed up<br />\nthat morning to see the Dean<br />\nabout dropping some courses.<br />\nShe cooed in jest. \"Oooh, Kid,<br />\nyou don't know how tough it is<br />\nto be without brains. Any Dude<br />\nmajor will tell you. I think I'll<br />\ntransfer to Florida State and<br />\nmajor in suntan.\" \"Hang in<br />\nthere,\" I said. Hang in there.<br />\nJoanne has her head screwed<br />\non straighter. \"Mum! There's a<br />\ndead bishop on the landing!\" she<br />\nused to joke. \"What's 'is<br />\ndiocese?\" I used to ask. \"How<br />\nshould I know?\" she used to<br />\nwhine. \"It's tatooed on the back<br />\nof 'is neck,\" I used to answer. We<br />\ndo this no longer, though I wish<br />\nwe could. Joanne drowned on a<br /><br />\nmarshmallow recently. So it goes.<br />\nThere is a bell tower at Cornell<br />\nrun by people full of bad<br />\nchemicals. They torture the<br />\nstudents by playing \"Have You<br />\nNever Been Mellow\" and \"A<br />\nHard Rain's Gonna Fall\"<br />\nconsecutively on the chimes. One<br />\ntime I was walking back from<br />\nHelen Newman Hall where on of<br />\nmy sister's friends was supposed<br />\nto meet her on a field hockey bus<br />\nfrom Bucknell. Can't you meet<br />\non any old field hockey bus? I<br />\nwisecracked. The dreaded chimes<br />\nstarted playing. Have some candy<br />\ncorn, my sister said. Don't mind<br />\nif I do, I replied. Don't minc'if I<br />\ndo.<br />\nOne of Joanne's better albums<br />\nis called \"Changesone\". By David<br />\nBowie. One of the songs on it is<br />\ncalled \"suffragette City.\" The<br />\nsong winks at me occassionally<br />\nand says 'Hey man'.'Hey man', I<br />\nwink back.

Three tables of horny<br />\nyoung Cornellians sat down<br />\nimmediately next to us. Could be<br />\ntense.

In<br />\nyour ear, Billy-Willy.<br />\nSome of the people that go to<br />\nschool at Cornell seem obsessed<br />\nwith grades, exams, and other<br />\nmeasures of academic<br />\nachievement. These students<br />\nmade a guest appearance in the<br />\ncomic strip Doonesbury not long<br />\nago. Along wish some Hopkins<br />\nstudents. A krofessor lectured<br />\nfervently. \"What do we have,<br />\nclass, when a deep knowledge of<br />\nthe law is tempered by a strong<br />\nsense of morality?\" \"Class?. Sandy and Donna requested<br />\nthat I write this. \"Can a Canuck<br />\nfuck?\"<br />\n\"Eats.\" The sign beckoned.<br />\n\"Bette and Juniors Bar and<br />\nGrill.\" I hear that Junior's just a<br />\nthavage, Donna lisps. My mind<br />\ndrifted ahead to thoughts of the<br />\nWar Memorial Colonnade. Steam<br />\nissues from manholes in the<br />\nsidewalk. On a foggy night the<br />\nscene is eerie.

And so it goes.<br />\nOne Cornell freshman, with a<br />\nsnuffly Al Pacino voice, said this.<br />\n\"Cornell is cut off from the<br />\nworld. We never get holidays!\". I<br />\nprodded. \"No holidays?\" Ile said<br />\nthis. \"If the president of the<br />\nuniversity were killed tomorrow,<br />\nnot only wouldn't we get a day<br />\noff, but we would have to go to a<br />\nseminar on his death.\" So it goes.<br />\nThe bus ride home is long,<br />\nbrutish, and nasty.

When<br />\nreporter Richard Ben Cramer,<br />\none of the paper's top journalists<br />\nand a former editor of the<br />\nHopkins News-Letter, included a<br />\nfew erroneous facts in a story,<br />\nthe Sun felt that they certainly<br />\nhad wrongly screwed Beall to the<br />\nwall.

The<br />\ndirector, age 35, is a former<br />\ncritic. He has taken George<br />\nSimenon's novel The Clockmaker<br />\nof Everton, assembled a<br />\nprofessional crew, and made a<br />\nvery fine movie. Tavernier wrote<br />\nthe script in conjunction with<br />\ntwo veteran screenwriters\u2014Jean<br />\nAurenche and Pierre Bost,<br />\nwho've been working together<br />\nsince the1940's. Their script for<br />\nRene Clement's 1952 film<br />\n\"Forbidden Games\" explored the<br />\neffects of war on a small girl who<br />\nmust come to terms with the<br />\ndeath of her parents. The insights<br />\ninto character were acute and<br />\noften subtle, but these men were<br />\ndilegently hammering themes<br />\ninto our heads, and as a result<br />\n\"Forbidden Games\" remains one<br />\nof the French cinema's most<br />\npowerful representations of the<br />\neffects of WWII on the French<br />\npeople. The script for \"The<br />\nClockmaker\" is similar in that<br />\npsychological nuances<br />\naccumulate. The audience is<br />\ncaught up in the pattern, and by<br />\nthe end of the film we are led to<br />\ncondone a murder.<br />\nPhilippe Noiret portrays a<br />\nmiddle-aged clockmaker. We see<br />\nhim eating and playing with his<br />\nfriends. His laughter and good<br />\nnature are infectious. These<br />\nopening minutes are an example<br />\nof what the French film often<br />\ndoes so well. What other national<br />\ncinema has made the preparation<br />\nand consumption of food such a<br />\njoyful event? I think an entire<br />\nfilm could be made depicting<br />\nnothing but a soiree, because the<br />\nFrench film excells in the<br />\ndepiction of small groups of<br />\nTomorrow evening, at 8:30,<br />\npianist Radu Lupu will open the<br />\nhighly acclaimed Shriver Hall<br />\nConcert Series. The series, which<br />\ntends to the intimacy of chamber<br />\nrecitals rather than the distance<br />\nof the orchestral concert hall,<br />\ncontinues in its tradition of<br />\nexcellence, offering some of the<br />\nbest musical talent available to<br />\nBaltimore concert goers.<br />\nRadu Lupu is without<br />\nquestion one of the finest of the<br />\nyoung pianists, enjoying a<br />\nreputation easily on par with<br />\nsuch artists as Stephen Bishop,<br />\nMurray Perahia, and Maurizio<br />\nPollini. (It is interesting to note<br />\nthat both Pollini and Perahia<br />\nhave played in the Shriver Series<br />\nwithin the last three years.)<br />\nIle has recorded extensively<br />\nfor the London label, one of his<br />\nmost recent recordings being the<br />\nBrahms Piano Concerto No. 2.<br />\nwith Lorin Maazel and the<br />\nCleveland Symphony. He plays<br />\nstrongly in a romantic -style.<br />\nspecializing in such composers as<br />\nSchuman, Brahms. Schubert, and<br />\nGrieg.<br />\nWith a divine mixture youthful<br />\ntire and mature restraint, his<br />\ninterpretations bristle with<br />\nvivacity and excitement; he is a<br />\npianist who wears well with the<br />\nintimacy of a chamber concert. It<br />\nis like listening to an avid.<br /><br />\nfriends eating. playing, and<br />\nloving. The depth of character<br />\nanalysis and the complexity of<br />\nhuman relationships is something<br />\nlacking from most American<br />\nfilms, for our filmmakers have<br />\nalways found their strength in<br />\naction, suspense, spectacle, and<br />\nscrewball comedy.<br />\n1-iere we have a normal<br />\ngathering of friends. There is no<br />\ngreat white shark lurking nearby.<br />\nNone of the characters has a<br />\nMagnum tucked in his belt, nor is<br />\nLucille Ball getting stuck in a<br />\nchimney. The French film can<br />\nmake depictions of the mundane<br />\na joy to watch (as in \"Vincent.<br />\nFrancois, Paul and the Others\".)<br />\nAnd what do these complacent<br />\nmiddle class men talk about? One<br />\nsays, \"France is going to the<br />\ndogs,\" but their discussion of<br />\ncapital punishment is no more<br />\nthan cheerful banter:<br />\n\"Executions will be televised in<br />\nprime time before the sitcoms.\"<br />\nIt all seems harmless enough. The<br />\nclockmaker is a man so<br />\nconscientious in his obedience of<br />\nthe law that he refuses to walk<br />\nacross an empty street until the<br />\nlight changes: \"I like to be legal.\"<br />\nAfter all, what does a clockmaker<br />\nand repairer do? Doesn't he keep<br />\nour clocks\u2014and by extension our<br />\nlives\u2014in orderly motion? He<br />\nhelps society to run smoothly,<br />\npredictably.<br />\nThis social complacency is<br />\nexactly what Tavernier is<br />\nattacking. There are ugly currents<br />\nbeneath the calm surface. The<br />\nnext morning, as the clockmaker<br />\nis dutifully opening up his shop,<br />\na police car pulls up, and he is<br />\ntaken away. On the car radio can<br />\nbe heard a jazz score, a soft<br />\nvoice: \"80% of the French<br /><br />\nenergetic conversationalist who<br />\nknows his topics well.<br />\nOn the concert bill are the<br />\nSonata Number Eight (Opus 13),<br />\nthe Pathetique Sonata of<br />\nBeethoven; Bela Barok's \"Out of<br />\nDoors\" Suite; and the Schubert<br />\nSonata in B flat.<br />\nVaried, though with a<br />\npronounced Romanticist bent,<br />\nthese pieces cover a wide realsm<br />\nin of European Piano Literature.<br />\nThe Beethoven. turbulent and<br />\ntragic, is no doubt well known to<br />\nmost listeners.

And you?\"<br />\nNoiret is told that his son has<br />\nkilled a man. When the officer<br />\nasks him to fasten his safety belt<br />\nhe asks listlessly: \"Why?\" As<br />\nNoiret is questioned by a police<br />\nbureaucracy he slowly begins to<br />\nreject conventions, to question<br />\neverything.<br />\nThe police realize he had no<br />\nknowledge of his son's crime, but<br />\nstill warn him to not leave town.<br />\nNoiret's face is remarkable in its<br />\nability to show confusion,<br />\ndisillusionment, a tired blankness<br />\nof expression: \"I can't think<br />\nstraight.\" Police and a bourgeois<br />\npress harass him. The _police<br />\ninspector (Jean Rochefort) is a<br />\nman of about the same age, and<br />\nhe also has a son. An interesting<br />\nrelationship develops between<br />\nthe two men._ The police<br />\ninspector says: \"If you don't<br />\nunderstand your own kids you<br />\ntry other people's.\" But Noiret<br />\nhas never really understood his<br />\nown son: \"Words don't have the<br />\nsame meaning between us<br />\nanymore.\" Society is running<br />\nsmoothly, the investigation<br />\nproceeds methodically, the<br />\ninspector and the clockmaker get<br /><br />\nTwentieth-Century stylistic<br />\nframework. And the Schubert<br />\nSonata is a pure delight, deftly<br />\nmixing form and line into a most<br />\nexquisite musical package.<br />\nAs if the mere listing of the<br />\nconcert agenda and artist were<br />\nnot enough, there are extra<br />\nreasons fro the Hopkins student<br />\nto attend the series.

Considine<br /><br />\nalong, but within Noiret's head<br />\nthe social framework is<br />\ncrumbling. His son is a criminal,<br />\nmay be shot on sight, and has<br />\ndisrupted the order of society,<br />\nbut he is still his son\u2014even<br />\nthough they never really knew<br />\none another: \"He didn't talk to<br />\nme. Everyone talked to me. Not<br />\nhe.\"<br />\nJustified?<br />\nThe murder was not without<br />\nreason. Razon, the man killed,<br />\nwas a factory policeman who had<br />\nattacked many girls, including<br />\nthe son's girlfriend. The script<br />\nhas accumulated nuances and<br />\nnow delivers a hammer blow. Was<br />\nthis murder justifiable? Is there<br />\nan order of morality beyond the<br />\nlegal and social framework?<br />\nThe father sleeps in his son's<br />\nroom, thinks continually of the<br />\nson, and though neither the<br />\nfather nor the audience has seen<br />\nthe son, we can see the father<br />\ngrowing closer to the boy.<br />\nSociety is \"disrupted.\" The<br />\nclockmaker is seen on a television<br />\nnews program, there are factory<br />\ndemonstration. Bourgeois society<br />\namuses itself. At the murder site<br />\nNoiret observes a family posing<br />\nfor photographs.<br />\nThe son is arrested. Noiret, no<br />\nlonger complacent, questions the<br />\ninspector: \"Did you torture<br />\nhim?\" The inspector laughs this<br />\noff. Society is too civilized:<br />\n\"Bloody faces and dirty clubs.<br />\nThat's just the movies...We hit<br />\nthem with phone books. It leaves<br />\nno mark.\" Cruelty is well<br />\npackaged, made legal, proper. It<br />\nis no coincidence that the<br />\nmurdered man was a policeman.<br />\nWhen father meets son, the<br />\nson says, \"Hello Dad,\" but these<br />\nare the only words between<br />\nthem.

You want to<br />\nfind some excuse to believe it really didn't happen exactly<br />\nthe way the story is being told. After all, that kind of thing<br />\ndoesn't happen here in the U.S. of A., the home of the free<br />\nand open Presidential elections. At least that's that way you<br />\nrationalize it. You don't want to acknowledge what<br />\nhappened to them, because if you<br />\ndo, you have to throw<br />\nout all those secure feelings you have on D level in the library<br />\nor around the waterpipe in your room.<br />\nAre these kinds of security the full extent of freedom of<br />\nthought?<br />\nThe Student Council is to be commended this time for<br />\ntheir coming out in support of Ceci and Pione. The decision<br />\nto emphasize community relations in this case is a healthy<br />\nstance, long overdue from several segments of the Hopkins<br />\ncommunity. Too many undergraduates pass through their<br />\nfour years here with a high-powered degree and a crippled<br />\nsocial sensibility.<br />\nAn excellent start for all of us ivory tower isolationists<br />\nwould be to take time to attend the benefit for the Baltimore<br />\n2 tomorrow night at Bread and Roses. It will probably be a<br />\nmildly shocking experience, because people hope to talk<br />\nabout more than this particular case. Don't try to kid<br />\nyourself that theirs is an isolated occurence. There are too<br />\nmany such \"incidents\" being spoken of these days.<br /><br />\nletters to the editor<br />\nTo the Editor:<br />\nI take great exception to the<br />\nletter from Daniel D. Wile<br />\npublished in the October 26<br />\nNews-Letter concerning your<br />\narticle on Daniel Ellsberg's<br />\nappearance at Hopkins.<br />\nIn attacking the News-Letter's<br />\n\"disturbingly narrow-minded<br />\nnaive liberal bias,\" Mr. Wile<br />\nbetrays his own bias by<br />\nchallenging us to<br />\n\"remember that Dr. Ellsberg<br />\nbroke the law and many<br />\nconfidences, both grave forms of<br />\ndishonor.\" Without wishing to<br />\nconfuse Mr. Wile with facts, I<br />\nmight point out that Dr. Ellsberg,.<br />\nto my knowledge, has yet to be<br />\nconvicted of any violation of the<br />\nlaw with regards to his release of<br />\nthe Pentagon Papers.<br />\nFurthermore, it is a strange logic<br />\nthat characterizes as dishonorable<br />\nthe efforts of someone to expose<br />\nthe lies perpetrated upon the<br />\nAmerican people by their<br />\ngovernment. If this be dishonor.<br />\nthen let us encourage similar<br />\nforms of dishonor among our<br />\npublic officials.<br /><br />\nfr<br /><br />\nMr. Wile accuses your reporter<br />\nof slandering the Administration<br />\nby reporting President Muller's<br />\nrefusal to meet with the<br />\nContinental Walkers about<br />\nHopkins' sponsorship of the<br />\nmilitary oriented Applied Physics<br />\nLab. Mr. Wile feels that Dr.<br />\nMuller ought to have equal time.<br />\nEqual to what? Members of the<br />\nCommittee for the Conversion of<br />\nthe Applied Physics Lab have<br />\nbeen trying for months to<br />\narrange a public forum at A.P.L.<br />\nto discuss the University's<br />\ncontinued complicity there. It is<br />\nthe Administration that<br />\ncontinues to refuse.<br />\nMr. Wile also seems to support<br />\nthe paradoxical thinking of the<br />\ndefense establishment that the<br />\nroad to security lies in emulating<br />\nthe behavior of those countries<br />\nwe call our enemies. Dr. Ellsberg<br />\nbelonged to that same defense<br />\nestablishment until he realized, as<br />\nmany other citizens of the world<br />\nnow realize, that none of us is<br />\nsecure as long as the imminent<br />\nthreat of.nuclear destruction, by<br />\naccident or design, remains.<br />\nGerry Gaeng<br /><br />\nAsylum?<br /><br />\nAn angry reply to Mr. Blizzard<br />\nAs something of a<br />\nself-appointed nuisance, I think it<br />\nincumbent upon me to respond<br />\nto Keith Blizzard's letter in a<br />\nrecent issue of the News-Letter.<br />\nSo...<br />\nMr. Blizzard's views are a very<br />\ngood example of what every gay<br />\nmust deal with before he can<br />\naccept himself. The word is<br />\n\"prejudice.\" and it is obvious<br />\nfrom the letter in question that,<br />\nas in all matters of this sort, some<br />\npretty strong emotions are<br />\ninvolved.<br />\nAs soon as I began reading the<br />\nletter I knew this was not going<br />\nto be nice; \"Last year when<br />\nHopkins began providing an<br />\nasylum for the Gay Caucus, I,<br />\nlike the majority of the student<br />\nbody, maintained an unbias (sic)<br />\nconsensus of opinion. Although<br />\nthis activity shocked my inherent<br />\nmorals I excused it as another<br />\nliberal experiment on the part of<br />\nthe university.\"<br />\nAn asylum. That's just what<br />\nwe don't want. We've had<br />\nasylums. Perhaps Mr. Blizzard<br />\nwants to reinstitute aversion<br />\ntherapy and prefrontal<br />\nlobotomies. Those are two very<br />\neffective ways to deal with<br />\nhomosexuality. And they're such<br />\nhumane ways of doing it too.<br />\nYou didn't have to be crazy to be<br />\ninstitutionalized in the good old<br />\ndays. Homosexuality was often<br />\ngood enough cause.<br />\nAsylum. We don't want that<br />\neither. We simply want to be<br />\naccepted as functional<br />\nconstructive members of this<br />\nsociety. There is no reason why<br />\nwe should need asylum. As it is, I<br />\ndefy you to find a major social,<br />\npolitical, or religious institution<br />\nwhich offers it to us. Gays are<br />\nlucky to. get an unbiased<br />\nreception, which is obviously<br />\nsomething Mr. Blizzard was not<br />\nprepared to give us, despite what<br />\nhe says about an \"unbias<br />\nconsensus-of opinion,\" whatever<br />\nthat may mean.<br />\nThe fact that Mr. Blizzard's<br />\n\"inherent morals\" were shocked<br />\nand that he feels that the<br />\nuniversity must be \"excused\" for<br />\nthe Caucus makes it very plain<br />\nthat he views homosexuals in the<br />\nlight of some very unkind and<br />\noften false stereotypes. I<br />\nunderstand this. I've got my own<br />\nproblems with .stereotypes, but I<br />\ntry my best to look at the real<br />\npeople in spite of them. As a<br />\nreasonably intelligent and<br />\nhopefully somewhat enlightened<br />\nhuman being, I must do this; it is<br />\nobligatory.<br />\nMr. Blizzard evidently doesn't<br />\nknow it, but he hit upon the<br />\nright answer in his letter: \"Our<br />\nfirst response was one of<br />\nlaughter, thinking there must be<br />\na costume party on campus.\"<br />\nThe Caucus' dance was a<br />\nHalloween dance, and the<br />\npublicity for it included the<br />\nphrase \"costume optional.\"<br />\nThat's why there were men in<br />\nwomen's clothing on campus.<br />\nThere were also men dressed as<br />\nRoman centurions.<br />\n\". . .then my stomach turned<br />\nas the truth of the situation<br />\ndawned on me.\" This doesn't<br />\nsound very unbiased to me. The<br />\nsituation Mr. Blizzard refers to<br />\nwas nothing more or less than a<br />\ndance. Is there any reason why<br /><br />\ngays should be denied the social<br />\nactivity of a dance'? I certainly<br />\nhaven't come across one. What is<br />\nall the fuss about? I can see Mr.<br />\nBlizzard being upset if he<br />\nwitnessed an homosexual orgy or<br />\neven perhaps if he had observed a<br />\npublic display of<br />\naffection\"\u2014does his stomach<br />\nturn every time he sees a man<br />\nand a woman kissing?\u2014but a few<br />\nstrays from the dance do not<br />\nseem adequate cause' for his<br />\nindignation.<br />\nI will not deny that there are<br />\nsome male homosexuals who<br />\nhabitually wear women's<br />\nclothing\u2014the colloquial<br />\nexpression for them is \"drag<br />\nqueens.\" I won't even say that<br />\nthere weren't a few of them at<br />\n.the dance; in fact, Mr. Rodrigue's<br />\npiece in the same issue of the<br />\nNews-Letter makes it obvious<br />\nthat there were. But to attack<br />\ngays as a group on the basis of<br />\nthe few atypical people Mr.<br />\nBlizzard and his friends saw is<br />\npurely irrational. Al! gays do not<br />\ngo in drag; the vast majority, in<br />\nfact, do not.<br /><br />\nsafe at our meetings; it you don't<br />\ntrust tts, you may depend on one<br />\nof the straights who attend our<br />\nmeetings to protect you. One<br />\nmore time\u2014the popular ideas<br />\nabout us are largely untrue, and<br />\nit's very frustrating for us to see<br />\nthem so vividly expressed as they<br />\nare in Mr. Blizzard's letter.<br />\nubjc.ct<br />\nic sm<br />\ndpouebsHocprkiitnsis<br />\nby<br />\nitselfto<br />\n.why public<br />\nproviding an asylum for the<br />\nabnormal of our society?\"<br />\ninfMorrniatBioliiizzIadrdorfetvi<br />\n. Tdoentthlye as<br />\nbest<br />\nof my knowledge, there has been<br />\nno public criticism of the<br />\nuniversity because of the Caucus'.<br />\nexistence. I'm sorry Mr. Blizzard<br />\nwas embarassed in front of his<br />\nfriends, but it could have<br />\nheppened anywhere. Drag queens<br />\nare, almost by definition, r ot<br />\nrestricted to gay dances. Those of<br />\nyou who attended the centennial<br />\nball last year may recall that<br />\nthere was a guy in drag there<br />\nmost transvestites are<br />\nnot gay).<br />\nAgain, Hopkins is not<br />\nproviding an asylum. There were<br />\ngays here long before the Caucus<br />\nwas formed; the odds are very<br />\ngood that every class has<br />\ngraduated its share of<br />\nhomosexuals. The Caucus was<br />\nformed, not to be an asylum, but<br />\nto combat the prejudices Mr.<br />\nBlizzard expresses. It is a means<br />\nby which we hope to show that<br />\n\"faggots\" and \"dykes\" are no<br />\nmore adequate generic labels<br />\nthan are \"kikes,\" \"broads\" or<br /><br />\n\"niggers.\"<br /><br />\nI'm not trying to deny that \"a<br />\nman dressed in feminine<br />\ngarments enter(ed) the ladies<br />\n(sic) room,\" although I've been<br />\ntold that it may simply have been<br />\na very masculine-looking woman.<br />\nIf the incident did happen the<br />\nway Mr. Blizzard described<br />\nit\u2014and I frankly do not doubt his<br />\nveracity\u2014it was indeed uncalled<br />\nfor. I do not approve of it.<br />\nNeither, for that matter, do I like<br />\nthe idea of going in drag. But<br />\nwhat Mr. Blizzard and his friends<br />\nsaw were the actions of a few<br />\nindividuals; to generalize and say<br />\nthis behavior is an invariable<br />\ncharacteristic of every gay male is<br />\nsimply prejudice. It is not fair to<br />\njudge us in this way.<br />\nI am not quibbling with Mr.<br />\nBlizzard's complaint; there is<br />\nindeed some legitimate basis for<br />\nit. What I am taking exception to<br />\nis the general tone of the letter.<br />\nThe gentlemen were so<br />\nunfortunate as to see what is<br />\nperhaps their most fearful<br />\nstereotype about homosexuals<br />\npersonified. But the number of<br />\ndrag queens ill relation to the<br />\ntotal number of gays is small.<br />\nThis unpleasant image is largely<br />\nunfounded. If Mr. Blizzard, or<br />\nanyone else, for that matter,<br />\nwants to give us a fair chance, he<br />\nneed merely come to a few<br />\nmeetings of the Caucus. We<br />\nencourage this; it's part of our<br />\npurpose. Your virtue is perfectly<br /><br />\n'Abnormal'<br />\nMy last quote from Mr.<br />\nBlizzard's letter raises that (Id<br />\nbugaboo of \"abnormal.\" WILit<br />\ndoes it mean? Need it be<br />\nreiterated tha t<br />\nhomosexuality<br />\n. \u2014althou gh<br />\nadmittedly not exclusive<br />\nhomosexuality\u2014has been<br />\nobserved in every mammal ever<br />\nused for research: cows, dogs.<br />\nrats, dolphins, monkeys. cats.<br />\netc.? Our sexuality may not be<br />\nthe \"norm'', but it is rot<br />\nabnormal ill the sense that tt<br />\ndoesn't occur in nature. If Mr.<br />\nBlizzard uses that definition. I<br />\nmust assume that he is also<br />\ntotally repulsed by women who<br />\nshave their legs.<br />\nShall I argue that t he<br />\naccoutrements of our society, if<br />\nnot our society itself, re<br />\nabnormal? Remember that t he<br />\ncause of homosexuality is s till<br />\nunknown, but theorists tend to<br />\nbelieve that. it's environmental;<br />\nthe anatomical and physiologi,Cal<br />\ntheories have never found anY<br />\ndifference between straights arid<br />\ngays. Maybe I should argue tl at<br />\nhomosexuality is a naturat<br />\nconsequence of our society.<br />\nLet's be sure our world is pure<br />\nand normal. Don't expose the<br />\nchildren to this scourge; let's<br />\nforget that no civilized count*/<br />\nhas ever had a zero incidence of<br />\nhomosexuality and that It's<br />\ndoubtful any primitive one has.<br />\nSuch may be the world r.<br />\nBlizzard inhabits\u2014a world totally<br />\nfree of even the vaguest hint. of<br />\nhomosexuality.

But as<br />\n'`drama critic': for the<br />\nNews-Letter I took up the task,<br />\nand was treated to a most<br />\nenjoyable evening.<br />\nThe play itself is beautifully<br />\nwritten, chock full of twists and<br />\nturns in the grand tradition of A<br />\nMidsummer Night's Dream. To<br />\nrelate the plot would spoil any of<br />\nthe terrific surprises, so a bare<br />\noutline of the characters will<br />\nsuffice<br />\nMr. and Mrs. Hardcastle are<br />\ntwo wealthy English folks who<br />\nlive in the country with their as<br />\nyet unmarried daughter, Kate,<br />\nand their mischievous stepson,<br />\nTony Lumpkin. Also present is<br />\nConstance Neville, Mrs.<br />\nNardcastle's niece who she is<br />\ndesperately trying to hitch up<br />\nwith Tony, who despises her.<br />\nAlso add an incompetent, but<br />\nlovable group of servants headed<br />\nby the nearly toothless Diggory,<br />\nand Pimple, a maidservant, the<br />\nonly one in the play who seems<br />\nto be aware of what is happening.<br />\nOn the scene pops Young<br />\nMarlow, a hopeful for the hand<br />\nof Kate and son of Mr.<br />\nHardcastle's old buddy, Sir<br />\nCharles Marlow, and his<br />\ncompanion, George Hastings.<br />\nBefore reaching the Hardcastle<br />\nestate, Young Marlow and<br />\nHastings stop at an in where<br />\nTony is living it up with some<br />\nfriends. And from this point on,<br />\nled by the plotting mind of<br /><br />\nTony, everything turns to<br />\nchaos...<br />\nStaging<br />\nGenerally the staging is tight<br />\nand imaginative, a few times<br />\nawkward, where actors are asked<br />\nto make roundabout trips around<br />\nfurniture instead of simpler,<br />\ndirect routes. The blocking and<br />\ndirection is fastpaced and often<br />\nthere are several simultanebus<br />\nactions to occupy the eye of the<br />\naudience. Twice during the<br />\nproduction, Tony Lumpkin<br />\nConstance Neville can be seen<br />\nflirting backstage, while a<br />\nconversation takes place upstage.<br />\nThe first time it appears<br />\ncontrived and rehearsed; the<br />\nsecond, spontaneous and a<br />\nbrilliant show of silent humor.<br />\nThe scene changes are innovative<br />\nand the musical interludes are<br />\nclassy and delightful. A word<br />\nabout the set design, which,<br />\nunfortunately, most of the<br />\naudience will overlook. The stage<br />\nand movable ceiling are both<br />\npainted with great detail;<br />\notherwise the set is simple and<br />\nunpretentious, yet effective and<br />\nbeautiful. Because I know very<br />\nlittle about costuming from this<br />\nera I cannot comment on its<br />\nauthenticity, although I was<br />\nextremely impressed. Some of<br />\nthe make-up seemed a little<br />\nheavy in spots, especially with<br />\nDiggory, \u2022but this is a trivial<br />\ncomment when one leafs through<br />\nthe program and realizes the<br />\namazing physical transformations<br />\nthe actors have gone through.<br />\nThe acting ranges from good<br />\nto brilliant. One of the most<br />\ndifficult aspects of wordy drama<br />\nis to make the lines sound as if<br />\nthey are not just being recited.<br /><br />\nPaul C. Thomas, as Mr.<br />\nHardcastle opened the show<br />\nreading his lines stiffly, but as the<br />\nplay progressed, loosened up and<br />\nwas nothing less than excellent.<br />\nHis facial expressions, so essential<br />\nto this production, were<br />\nexaggerated just to the proper<br />\npoint, and he proves to be a great<br />\ncomic talent. Michael Haney, as<br />\nTony Lumpkin, was my per.,onal<br />\nfavorite, and perhaps the best<br />\ncharacter in the written play. He<br />\nis a mischievous personality who,<br />\nnonetheless, has the audience<br />\nbehind him the whole way.<br />\nReminiscent of Malcolm<br />\nMcDowall, he has one of the<br />\nmost expressive faces I have ever<br />\nseen. It is fair to say Michael<br />\nHaney is worth the price of<br />\nadmission. Jim Boraddus as<br />\nYoung Marlow, seemed very<br />\ncomfortable in the somewhat<br />\ndifficult character transitions he's<br />\nasked to perform, and extremely<br />\ncompetent both in comic and<br />\nserious moments. Dan Diggles, as<br />\nGeorge Hastings, may be the<br />\nmost professional actor in the<br />\ncast, more subdued than Tony's<br />\npart, but equally exciting. Of all<br />\nthe performers he appears the<br />\nmost relaxed on the stage, and is<br />\nparticularly adept at playing to<br />\nall parts of the audience.<br />\nDiggory, played by Dan Szelag, is<br />\na scene stealer. Enough said.<br />\nCompetent performances by<br />\nDonna Welby as Pimple, Roland<br />\nBull as Sir Charles Marlow, and<br />\nagain as Stingo. My only<br />\ncomplaint is in the writing of the<br />\nplay, as these characters are'<br />\nrather shallow. I feel shallowness<br />\nis also a problem with Mrs.<br />\nHardcastle, played by Carol<br />\nGustafson, a though I'm not<br />\nfrInterert<br /><br />\nMitItMerftr5e<br /><br />\nsure whether this is the fault of<br />\nthe director, the writer, or Ms.<br />\nGustafson. It is still a very good<br />\nperformance, but perhaps<br />\nupstaged by the others. Tana<br />\nHicken, as Kate Hardcastle acts<br />\nbest in her maiden role; her lines<br />\nseem more forced and rehearsed<br />\nwhen she actually plays the<br />\nwealthy daughter. Her comic<br />\nlines generally do not come<br />\nacross. In a play distinctly<br />\nBritish, Christine Baranski's<br />\n(Constance Nevelle) accent<br />\nbothers me. Although her comic<br />\nactions and lines are successful,<br />\nthe majority of the time she<br />\nseems miscast. Perhaps the<br /><br />\nM4791/1\"rfS \u201drliSioimritit\"<br /><br />\nOff7frre1rIfffftqlt<br /><br />\ndirector needed to have spent<br />\nmore time with Tony's friends,<br />\nplayed by Caleb Childs, Tim<br />\nMcCusker, Ken Tipper and<br />\nThomas G. Waites, or again it<br />\nmay be they just fade next to<br />\nvivid<br />\nMichael Haney's<br />\nperformance.<br />\nFrom the opening scene to the<br />\ncurtain calls the play is<br />\ndelightful. And because of the<br />\nnature of the play, and a<br />\ncombination of excellent acting<br />\nand tight direction, there is truly<br />\nnever a dull moment.<br />\nShe Stoops to Conquer plays<br />\nthrough November 21, at Center<br />\nStage, 700 N.
