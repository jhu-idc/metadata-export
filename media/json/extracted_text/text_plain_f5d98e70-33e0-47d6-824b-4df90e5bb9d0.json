Suskind said last night of<br />\nyesterday's GUS ruling on pass-fail grading for fresmen, and<br />\nhe was absolutely right. Confronted by the obvious, the dean<br />\napparently saw no way to avoid a matter-of-fact description<br />\nof the situation, and his statement on the pass-fail affair<br />\nshows that clearly enough.<br />\nBut candor of matters of this sort, while it may dissipate<br />\nstudents' justified anger, does little to reduce the damage that<br />\nhas been done to their faith in the University's promises. Nor<br />\ndoes candor in this issue do anything to alter the basic fact<br />\nthat some students, who did not do well academically in their<br />\nfirst semester, may be placed at a serious disadvantage when<br />\ngraduate schools request those grades, and the student-no<br />\nlonger backed by University guarantees that they would never<br />\nbe released-must decide alone whether to release them.<br />\nBy the change in the pass-fail policy, the University has undermined the very logic by which it justified the implementation of the plan in the first place. Students who were supposed to get a chance to adjust to the pressures of Hopkins<br />\nlife free of concern about grades now have learned that opportunity was nothing but a sham, to be rescinded whenever<br />\nUniversity officials changed their minds.<br />\nBut what makes all this even more suspicious is the fact<br />\nthat no graduate school has yet asked Hopkins for further information on students affected by the pass-fail plan. The<br />\nquestion then arises as to why the change was made at all.<br />\n<br />\nA man and his dog<br />\n\"Mr<br />\n<br />\nletters to the editor letters to the editor letters to the editor<br />\nTo the editor:<br />\nDuring the 1971-1972 academic<br />\nyear the Hopkins Undergraduate<br />\nManual stated that courses could<br />\nbe added or dropped up to \"three<br />\nweeks before' the beginning of the<br />\nfinal period.\" This policy was<br />\nsimilarly in effect in the<br />\n1970-1971 and 1969-1970 school<br />\nyears.

In addition, the Office of the<br />\nVice President, those of the Dean<br />\nand the Registrar support such a<br />\nchange.<br />\nThe change is clearly in the<br />\noffing; we only hope that the<br />\n<br />\nAcademic Council and the<br />\nCommittee on Undergraduate<br />\nStudies are responsive to the call<br />\nfor change and facilitate the<br />\nalteration of the add-drop deadline<br />\nfor the upcoming spring semester.<br />\nDan Raab<br />\nAlan Fink<br />\nDan Holick<br />\nTo the Editor:<br />\nIn light of various<br />\nmisconceptions surrounding the<br />\nactivities of SIN and the actions of<br />\nthe two chairmen of this year's<br />\nMSE Symposium, I feel it<br />\nnecessary to make some<br />\nclarifications.<br />\nFirst of all, the article in last<br />\nFriday's News-Letter implied that<br />\nour ad-hoc organization, Students<br />\nto Impeach Nixon, was planning to<br />\npicket Senator Percy at the<br />\nSymposium.

Most<br />\npeople go through life dreading<br />\nthey'll have a traumatic<br />\nexperience. Freaks are born with<br />\n\u2022 trauma. They've already passed<br />\ntheir test in life. They're<br />\naristocrats.\"<br />\nThe directness of Arbus'<br />\nphotographs is astounding. Her<br />\nsubjects are invariably looking<br />\nright into the camera, but still<br />\nthere is an amazing sense of<br />\ncandidness maintained. As<br />\nphotographers know, it is difficult<br />\nenough to take a candid shot of<br />\nsomeone. but to capture a candid,<br />\nrealistic pose. with the subject's<br />\neyes peering right in+o the lens is<br />\nindeed a type of magic. This magic,<br />\n<br />\nor perhaps mystical sense, pervades<br />\nthe work of Diane Arbus. What<br />\nmakes this all the more startling is<br />\nthat the scenes she captures are so<br />\nreal. Her photographs are a baffling<br />\ncombination of mysticism and<br />\nreality. The titles themselves bear<br />\nthis out. For example, \"Woman<br />\nWith Coin Purse,- \"Lady<br />\nBartender At Home With a<br />\nSouvenir Dog,\" \"Young Man In a<br />\nTrench Coat.\" These photographs<br />\ncould not be named otherwise.<br />\nThey capture a sense of realism<br />\nbeyond belief. In a sense they are<br />\nfrightening' they depict such a<br />\ndefined moment that there is no<br />\npossibility for fanciful<br />\ninterpretation.<br />\nThe photographs of Diane Arbus<br />\nare amazing, but not beautiful.<br />\nUnlike an Ansel Adams western<br />\nlandscape, they are not particularly<br />\npleasant to view. They exhibit such<br />\na sense of human desperation in<br />\nthe inner lives of the misfits of<br />\nsociety. Of her own works she<br />\nsaid: \"I do feel I have some slight<br />\n-corner of something about the<br />\nquality of things. I mean it's very<br />\nsubtle and a little embarrassing to<br />\nme, but I really believe there are<br />\nthings which nobody would see<br />\nunless I photographed them.\" And<br />\nso it was., Unfortunately Diane<br />\nArbus committed suicide in July of<br />\n1971 at the age of 48.<br />\nThe show runs through<br />\nNovember 15. It is a well done<br />\nexhibit which cannot help but<br />\nfascinate and move you.<br />\n<br />\ntraditional manner at the<br />\nSymposium. Much _thanks also to<br />\nthe thousand-plus persons who<br />\nsigned the petitions which Senator<br />\nPercy accepted following his<br />\nspeech.<br />\nSecondly, I would like to note<br />\nwhat we know of the dishonest<br />\nhandling of affairs with us by the<br />\nSymposium chairmen. At a<br />\nmeeting of SIN last Friday, Steve<br />\nBers and David Yaffe offered our<br />\ngroup a chance to make a five<br />\nminute statement and question at<br />\nthe start of the question-answer<br />\nperiod and also stated that they<br />\nwould introduce us. Under the<br />\nassumption that this offer was<br />\ngood and made in good faith, the<br />\nsteering committee of SIN spent<br />\nmany hours writing and<br />\nresearching what we felt to be a<br />\nthoughtful and informative<br />\ntaieiiieiii<br />\nve<br />\n<br />\n(11111<br />\n<br />\nkks.t<br />\n<br />\nqUeuu1I.<br />\n<br />\nt<br />\n<br />\n1, e<br />\n<br />\nCVGII<br />\n<br />\npetitions to the House.<br />\nI accept different views and can<br />\nunderstand why some may not<br />\nagree with our organization's<br />\nviews. But, I will not tolerate<br />\ndishonesty and the dishonest<br />\nmaneuverings of another person's<br />\n(or group's) trust. It is a sorry<br />\nsituation when a breach of trust<br />\noccurs. We in Students to Impeach<br />\nNixon hope that our efforts can<br />\nclear up another instance in which<br />\nthe public's trust has been<br />\nmanueve red.<br />\nBrenda Bodian<br />\nTo the Editor:<br />\nThe pervasive spirit of militarism<br />\non this campus, and throughout<br />\nthis country, is once again finding<br />\nits terrifying outlet. Even those<br />\nwho putatively claim to be<br />\nhorrified by United States<br />\n<br />\nmouse,\" \"Sadeye,\" and \"Rockeye<br />\nII,\" a new type of \"cluster bomb.\"<br />\nThen, even more murderous are<br />\nthe \"flechettes\" and \"beehives.\"<br />\nThese impale men on trees. The<br />\nInternational War Crimes Tribunal<br />\nof 1967, organized by Lord<br />\n(Bertrand) Russell, described the<br />\neffects of anti-personnel<br />\nfragments:<br />\n\"Their penetration power in the<br />\nhuman body is enormous. The<br />\nsame individual is struck by many<br />\nfragments. As the trajectory of<br />\nthese multiple projectiles is long<br />\nand irregular inside the body, the<br />\nlesions caused by even one<br />\nfragment alone are numerous,<br />\nvaried, difficult to detect and<br />\nrequire exceedingly difficult<br />\noperations. The failure of the<br />\nsurgeons to recognize one of the<br />\nlesions is usually fatal.<br />\nRile<br />\n<br />\nruuspnounth<br />\n<br />\nounum<br />\n<br />\ne<br />\n<br />\nquestion period. This Statement<br />\nwas read by Bers Monday morning<br />\n<br />\nwith my consent. Expecting an<br />\nintroduction from the Symposium<br />\nheads, we were put in an awkward<br />\nposition in attempting to make a<br />\nstatement without the knowledge<br />\nof Percy or the audience of the<br />\nprior agreement. Percy's belief that<br />\nit was a time for question\u00a7 and not<br />\nstatements prompted him to cut us<br />\nshort in deference to others who<br />\nmay have had questions.<br />\nAfter the Symposium, at a<br />\nreception for Percy (to /which we<br />\nwere invited by several people) we<br />\nquestioned Bers and Yaffe as to<br />\nwhat had happened. They stated<br />\n'they had told Senator Percy and<br />\nthat he had said he did not wish to<br />\nhear statements in such a short<br />\nsession. In presenting our petitions<br />\nto Percy and trying to give him at<br />\nleast parts of our statement and<br />\nquestion, we explained that we had<br />\nbeen told we would have the five<br />\nminutes and had not been allowed<br />\nthem. He told us he knew nothing<br />\nof it and called Steve and Dave<br />\nover to find out why he had not<br />\nbeen informed. Dave spoke to him<br />\nand needless to say, he and Steve<br />\nwere trapped into their deception.<br />\nGranted it is difficult to unravel<br />\noneself from a series of lies. Their<br />\ncover-up was weak and their<br />\napology in Tuesday's News-Letter<br />\nclearly does not reflect their actual<br />\nposition. Percy apologized for<br />\ncutting us off and graciously<br />\nagreed to personally deliver the<br />\n<br />\nmore massive infusion to arms,<br />\njets, weapons, technical advisors,<br />\nand even American pilots of<br />\nAmerican jets based in Greece or<br />\nTurkey. The U.S. warns Russia to<br />\nstay. out of the Mid-East. Who is<br />\nkidding whom? Or, notice the<br />\nzigzag of government statements.<br />\nOne day, Secretary of State<br />\nKissinger pronounces Soviet arms<br />\naid as \"moderate\" and solemnly<br />\nintones,\"the detente applies to the<br />\nMid-East or nowhere at all.\" The<br />\nnext day Secretary of Defense<br />\nSchlesinger (former CIA director)<br />\nand CIA Director William Colby<br />\ntestify to the House Arms Services<br />\nCommittee, and tell Congress that<br />\nthe \"Soviet airlift has been<br />\nominous...but the U.S. has already<br />\nfar exceeded (the Russian) in<br />\nmaterial via or massive shuttle.\" At<br />\nthe same time, reports the New<br />\nuric<br />\n<br />\ni Imes<br />\n<br />\nne<br />\n<br />\nauministration<br />\n<br />\n11<br />\n<br />\nas the U.S. pours \"the most<br />\nmodern weapons- into Israel. It is<br />\nall too easy to treat war material as<br />\na chess game, trading off Mig jets<br />\nfor Phantom jets, Sidewinder and<br />\nSkyhawk missiles for Sam and<br />\nFrog Soviet varieties.<br />\nAmong the weapons<br />\n\"furnished\" by the government in<br />\nthe latest Arab-Israeli War are<br />\nnapalm, cluster fragmentation<br />\nbombs, and the whole series of<br />\n\"recently developed\"<br />\nanti-personnel bombs and mines.<br />\nThe same weapons and \"methods\"<br />\nused by \"counter-insurgency forces<br />\nin the Mekong Delta, had been and<br />\nare being used in the Sinai Desert,<br />\nthe Golan Heights etc. As John<br />\nTompkins notes in The Weapons of<br />\nWorld War (page 116)1<br />\n-These anti-personnel weapons<br />\nrepresent a growing series of<br />\nmunitions in which the killing<br />\npower of conventional weapons<br />\nhas been made to approach that of<br />\nsmall tactical nuclear weapons.<br />\nThis was done by substituting<br />\ncontrolled fragments for the<br />\nrandom pieces created by the<br />\nexplosion of the conventional<br />\nshell.\"<br />\nThe above language may be<br />\noblique and abstract, but the effectof such weapons is all too horribly<br />\nclear--shredded man, beast, and<br />\nearth. The U.S. Air Force has even<br />\ngiven affectionate names to some<br />\nof these genocidal devices: \"lazy<br />\ndogs,\" \"butterfly bombs,\"<br />\n\"guavas,\" \"pineapples,\" \"mighty<br />\n<br />\nvicous than napalm, if one can say<br />\nsuch a thing. in the civilian<br />\nhospital at Can Tho, there were<br />\nmany who had a piece of white<br />\nphosphorous inside the flesh. It<br />\nwas still burning.\"<br />\nIn the meantime, the lies of the<br />\ngovernments concerned multiply as<br />\nthey inexorably must. As George<br />\nOrwell once wrote, \"In our time,<br />\npolitical language is by and large<br />\nlies in defense of the indefensible.\"<br />\nIt is the sheerest naivete to believe<br />\nin U.S. care for Israel, or Soviet<br />\nUnion care for Arab people. Under<br />\nthe guise 'of \"fraternal protection\"<br />\nthe super pow ers stalk death in the<br />\nMid-East, as elsewhere, using their<br />\n\"client States\" as hostages in a<br />\ncarefully modulated struggle for<br />\npolitical, economic, social and<br />\nmilitary control.<br />\nThree recent examples suffice to<br />\ndemonstrate this on-going<br />\nMachiavellian defense of murder.<br />\nConsider the circumstances of the<br />\nAmerican airlift to Israel, the<br />\nIsraeli wholesale violation of the<br />\ncease fire lines of October 22, the<br />\ndeception of the \"military alert\"<br />\nof U.S. forces. All fit into the same<br />\npattern of murder offstage,<br />\nduplicity onstage.<br />\nWhy is the United States so<br />\nmilitarily committed in the<br />\nMid -East? The government<br />\norchestrates public approval for<br />\narms aid to Israel by using the<br />\nexcuse of Soviet re-supplying of<br />\nEgyptian and Syrian armies. Thus,<br />\nthe United States managed an even<br />\n<br />\nbillion dollars to replace the jets<br />\n- given the<br />\nand --outer weapons<br />\n<br />\nIsraelis.<br />\nThe Israeli violation of the<br />\ncease-fire lines of October 22 fits<br />\ninto the pattern of grabbing more<br />\nand more territory in defense of<br />\n\"secure borders.\" The tragedy of<br />\nthis policy, the illusory nature of<br />\npeace thus obtained, the<br />\nconcomitant militarization of<br />\nIsraeli society, are all too<br />\ndepressingly clear. Major General<br />\nElazar, Israeli Chief of Staff had<br />\nvowed to \"break their bones one<br />\nby one.\" Yet, on October 21 in<br />\nMoscow, Henry Kissinger and<br />\nLeonid Brezhnev \"arranged\" a<br />\ncease-fire. The two governments<br />\nimmediately put forth a take-it or<br />\nleave-it joint resolution in the<br />\nUnited Nations Security Council,<br />\nyet neither government at that<br />\ntime revealed what had been<br />\nsecretly agreed to in Moscow,<br />\nmuch less the means for enforcing<br />\nthe cease-fire. [It is important to<br />\nalso note that all throughout the<br />\nwar the two superpowers were in<br />\nconstant communication, and that<br />\nboth governments used military<br />\nsatellites in space to gather<br />\ninformation.]<br />\nThe secret diplomacy contains<br />\nits own logic, its own built in<br />\nchecks and denial mechanisms.<br />\nKosygin goes to Cairo and<br />\nDamascus. Kissinger goes to<br />\nMoscow and then on to Tel-Aviv.<br />\nVirtually nothing of the content of<br />\nthese meetings is disseminated,<br />\nTHE<br />\n<br />\nexcept those selected portions<br />\nleaked deliberately to the press by<br />\none side or the other, for its own<br />\npurposes, to create a certain public<br />\nimpression. Thus, the international<br />\npress reports that Meir and Dayan<br />\nsay to Kissinger: \"Just give us<br />\nthree more days in Sinai.\"<br />\nSecretary Kissinger is quoted as<br />\nreplying, \"No, that's not possible.<br />\nThe cease-fire must take effect<br />\nnow.\" Once again, who is kidding<br />\nwhom? Could Israel have attacked<br />\nin the Sinai if the United States<br />\nhad explicitly warned her not to?<br />\nLastly, the U.S. military alert of<br />\nlast Wednesday night was but latest<br />\ncharade from a government that<br />\nwages secret war in Cambodia and<br />\nLaos, not to mention endless other<br />\nmatters. First, there is reason to<br />\nbelieve that in fact the U.S. and<br />\nthe Soviet Union had secretly<br />\nagreed to jointly police the<br />\nresponse to the howl at the United<br />\nNations. This is admittedly<br />\nspeculation. Nevertheless, at the<br />\nleast, one can state that there was<br />\nno military significance to the<br />\nalert. And, once again, at a press<br />\nconference the next day, Secretary<br />\nof Defense Schlesinger even<br />\ndelcared that \" the purpose of the<br />\nalert is diplomatic.\" Let's leave<br />\naside for the moment that the two<br />\nsuperpowers were \"in harmony\"<br />\nbefore the alert and after the alert,<br />\nbut suddenly not during the alert.<br />\nCollusion<br />\n<br />\nThere is neither detente, nor<br />\ncollaboration, nor open warfare<br />\nbetween the superpowers at this<br />\nmoment in the Middle-East.<br />\nRather, there is collusion.<br />\nNevertheless, even worse perhaps, a<br />\ncollusion using a public mask of<br />\nbrinkmanship, contains dangers of<br />\nescalation too. Then, for reasons<br />\nclear to no one, the American<br />\npeople are presented with a \"fait<br />\naccompli\": the committment of<br />\nU.S. troops, the danger of nuclear<br />\nconfrontation.<br />\nMost grievously, there is no<br />\nchance for peace in the Mid-East as<br />\nlong as Israel maintains the<br />\npsychology and actions of an<br />\noccupying army, and as long as<br />\nleaders like Golda Meir can persist<br />\nin the willful blindness of<br />\ndeclaring: \"The Palestinians.

It is estimated<br />\nthat only about 10 percent of all rapes<br />\nare reported, and of these,50 percent go<br />\nto court and one-third receive<br />\nconvictions.<br />\nOne woman suggested that the<br />\npunishment for rape conviction be made<br />\nmore nearly proportional to the degree of<br />\nthe crime. Instead of carrying the life<br />\nimprisonment sentence, it was suggested<br />\nthat, by viewing the crime as assault with<br />\na weapon, with the sentence being levied<br />\naccordingly. The reduction of the<br />\npunishment, woule likely yield more<br />\nconvictions, and, therefore, reduce the<br />\nchances of an assailant \"getting off the<br />\nhook.\"<br />\nIn a further effort to bring rape victims<br />\nto legal attention, the Center is<br />\nadvocating the establishment of a central<br />\nrape-treatment center for Baltimore city,<br />\nequiped with gynecologists and other<br />\npersonnel present to assist the confused<br />\n<br />\nvictim in the first hours following the<br />\noccurence of the crime.<br />\nMany rape victims shy away from the<br />\noften cold, insensitive atmosphere and<br />\ntreatment of the North East police<br />\nstation, where all rape victims are sent for<br />\nexamination. According to a social<br />\nworker at the station, a rape victim must<br />\nundergo impersonal interrogation,<br />\nfollowed by a medical examination in the<br />\n\"Sex Room\" by an \"on call\"<br />\ngynecologist. Considering that the<br />\nevidence of rape lasts approximately eight<br />\nhours, the time spent undergoing often<br />\nirrelevent questioning and waiting for a<br />\ngynecologist cuts into her chances of<br />\nexhibiting proof of being raped, Center<br />\nmembers contended.<br />\nThe proposed new center would not<br />\nrequire that rape victims attempt to<br />\nprosecute their assailants and risk public<br />\nembarrassment during possible courtroom<br />\ninvestigation into one's character.<br />\nAdcording to figures released thru the<br />\nMayor's office, Baltimore had 465 cases<br />\nof rape in 1972.<br />\n<br />\nto MaryPIRG, and could have included<br />\ndue payments with their tuition<br />\npayments.

Suskind said last night of<br />\nyesterday's GUS ruling on pass-fail grading for fresmen, and<br />\nhe was absolutely right. Confronted by the obvious, the dean<br />\napparently saw no way to avoid a matter-of-fact description<br />\nof the situation, and his statement on the pass-fail affair<br />\nshows that clearly enough.<br />\nBut candor of matters of this sort, while it may dissipate<br />\nstudents' justified anger, does little to reduce the damage that<br />\nhas been done to their faith in the University's promises. Nor<br />\ndoes candor in this issue do anything to alter the basic fact<br />\nthat some students, who did not do well academically in their<br />\nfirst semester, may be placed at a serious disadvantage when<br />\ngraduate schools request those grades, and the student-no<br />\nlonger backed by University guarantees that they would never<br />\nbe released-must decide alone whether to release them.<br />\nBy the change in the pass-fail policy, the University has undermined the very logic by which it justified the implementation of the plan in the first place. Students who were supposed to get a chance to adjust to the pressures of Hopkins<br />\nlife free of concern about grades now have learned that opportunity was nothing but a sham, to be rescinded whenever<br />\nUniversity officials changed their minds.<br />\nBut what makes all this even more suspicious is the fact<br />\nthat no graduate school has yet asked Hopkins for further information on students affected by the pass-fail plan. The<br />\nquestion then arises as to why the change was made at all.<br /><br />\nA man and his dog<br />\n\"Mr<br /><br />\nletters to the editor letters to the editor letters to the editor<br />\nTo the editor:<br />\nDuring the 1971-1972 academic<br />\nyear the Hopkins Undergraduate<br />\nManual stated that courses could<br />\nbe added or dropped up to \"three<br />\nweeks before' the beginning of the<br />\nfinal period.\" This policy was<br />\nsimilarly in effect in the<br />\n1970-1971 and 1969-1970 school<br />\nyears.

This<br />\nquestion notwithstanding, a return<br />\nto the later deadline is clearly the<br />\nmandate of the student body;<br />\nsignatures on nearly forty<br />\ncirculating petitions testify to this<br />\nfact. In addition, the Office of the<br />\nVice President, those of the Dean<br />\nand the Registrar support such a<br />\nchange.<br />\nThe change is clearly in the<br />\noffing; we only hope that the<br /><br />\nAcademic Council and the<br />\nCommittee on Undergraduate<br />\nStudies are responsive to the call<br />\nfor change and facilitate the<br />\nalteration of the add-drop deadline<br />\nfor the upcoming spring semester.<br />\nDan Raab<br />\nAlan Fink<br />\nDan Holick<br />\nTo the Editor:<br />\nIn light of various<br />\nmisconceptions surrounding the<br />\nactivities of SIN and the actions of<br />\nthe two chairmen of this year's<br />\nMSE Symposium, I feel it<br />\nnecessary to make some<br />\nclarifications.<br />\nFirst of all, the article in last<br />\nFriday's News-Letter implied that<br />\nour ad-hoc organization, Students<br />\nto Impeach Nixon, was planning to<br />\npicket Senator Percy at the<br />\nSymposium.

We<br />\ndo want to thank WILPF for<br />\nsending representatives and any<br />\nother area groups who came to<br />\nhear Percy and question him in the<br /><br />\nA Review:<br /><br />\nOn the eye of Arbus<br />\nBy JONATHAN KRASNOFF<br />\n\u2022 Presently on exhibit at the<br />\nBaltimore Museum of Art are a<br />\nsubstantial number of photographs<br />\nby the late Diane Arbus. The<br />\nphotographic work of Diane Arbus<br />\nhas gained wide acclaim in the past<br />\n10 years. The bizarre quality of<br />\nher subjects and directness of<br />\napproach is a unique, unparalleled<br />\nphotographic technique .<br />\nHer photographs deal almost exclusively with people, portrayed as<br />\nthey are. However, many of the<br />\nnormal scenes she captures on film<br />\nare the private or inside lives of individuals society would scorn as rejects. Many of her subjects are nudists, transvestites, and freaks.<br />\nArbus had an interesting philosophy of the subject: \"Freaks were<br />\na thing I photographed a lot.<br />\nThere's a legend about freaks. Most<br />\npeople go through life dreading<br />\nthey'll have a traumatic<br />\nexperience. Freaks are born with<br />\n\u2022 trauma. They've already passed<br />\ntheir test in life. They're<br />\naristocrats.\"<br />\nThe directness of Arbus'<br />\nphotographs is astounding. Her<br />\nsubjects are invariably looking<br />\nright into the camera, but still<br />\nthere is an amazing sense of<br />\ncandidness maintained. As<br />\nphotographers know, it is difficult<br />\nenough to take a candid shot of<br />\nsomeone. but to capture a candid,<br />\nrealistic pose. with the subject's<br />\neyes peering right in+o the lens is<br />\nindeed a type of magic. This magic,<br /><br />\nor perhaps mystical sense, pervades<br />\nthe work of Diane Arbus. What<br />\nmakes this all the more startling is<br />\nthat the scenes she captures are so<br />\nreal. Her photographs are a baffling<br />\ncombination of mysticism and<br />\nreality. The titles themselves bear<br />\nthis out. For example, \"Woman<br />\nWith Coin Purse,- \"Lady<br />\nBartender At Home With a<br />\nSouvenir Dog,\" \"Young Man In a<br />\nTrench Coat.\" These photographs<br />\ncould not be named otherwise.<br />\nThey capture a sense of realism<br />\nbeyond belief. In a sense they are<br />\nfrightening' they depict such a<br />\ndefined moment that there is no<br />\npossibility for fanciful<br />\ninterpretation.<br />\nThe photographs of Diane Arbus<br />\nare amazing, but not beautiful.<br />\nUnlike an Ansel Adams western<br />\nlandscape, they are not particularly<br />\npleasant to view. They exhibit such<br />\na sense of human desperation in<br />\nthe inner lives of the misfits of<br />\nsociety. Of her own works she<br />\nsaid: \"I do feel I have some slight<br />\n-corner of something about the<br />\nquality of things. I mean it's very<br />\nsubtle and a little embarrassing to<br />\nme, but I really believe there are<br />\nthings which nobody would see<br />\nunless I photographed them.\" And<br />\nso it was., Unfortunately Diane<br />\nArbus committed suicide in July of<br />\n1971 at the age of 48.<br />\nThe show runs through<br />\nNovember 15. It is a well done<br />\nexhibit which cannot help but<br />\nfascinate and move you.<br /><br />\ntraditional manner at the<br />\nSymposium. Much _thanks also to<br />\nthe thousand-plus persons who<br />\nsigned the petitions which Senator<br />\nPercy accepted following his<br />\nspeech.<br />\nSecondly, I would like to note<br />\nwhat we know of the dishonest<br />\nhandling of affairs with us by the<br />\nSymposium chairmen. At a<br />\nmeeting of SIN last Friday, Steve<br />\nBers and David Yaffe offered our<br />\ngroup a chance to make a five<br />\nminute statement and question at<br />\nthe start of the question-answer<br />\nperiod and also stated that they<br />\nwould introduce us. Under the<br />\nassumption that this offer was<br />\ngood and made in good faith, the<br />\nsteering committee of SIN spent<br />\nmany hours writing and<br />\nresearching what we felt to be a<br />\nthoughtful and informative<br />\ntaieiiieiii<br />\nve<br /><br />\n(11111<br /><br />\nkks.t<br /><br />\nqUeuu1I.<br /><br />\nt<br /><br />\n1, e<br /><br />\nCVGII<br /><br />\npetitions to the House.<br />\nI accept different views and can<br />\nunderstand why some may not<br />\nagree with our organization's<br />\nviews. But, I will not tolerate<br />\ndishonesty and the dishonest<br />\nmaneuverings of another person's<br />\n(or group's) trust. It is a sorry<br />\nsituation when a breach of trust<br />\noccurs. We in Students to Impeach<br />\nNixon hope that our efforts can<br />\nclear up another instance in which<br />\nthe public's trust has been<br />\nmanueve red.<br />\nBrenda Bodian<br />\nTo the Editor:<br />\nThe pervasive spirit of militarism<br />\non this campus, and throughout<br />\nthis country, is once again finding<br />\nits terrifying outlet. Even those<br />\nwho putatively claim to be<br />\nhorrified by United States<br /><br />\nmouse,\" \"Sadeye,\" and \"Rockeye<br />\nII,\" a new type of \"cluster bomb.\"<br />\nThen, even more murderous are<br />\nthe \"flechettes\" and \"beehives.\"<br />\nThese impale men on trees. The<br />\nInternational War Crimes Tribunal<br />\nof 1967, organized by Lord<br />\n(Bertrand) Russell, described the<br />\neffects of anti-personnel<br />\nfragments:<br />\n\"Their penetration power in the<br />\nhuman body is enormous. The<br />\nsame individual is struck by many<br />\nfragments. As the trajectory of<br />\nthese multiple projectiles is long<br />\nand irregular inside the body, the<br />\nlesions caused by even one<br />\nfragment alone are numerous,<br />\nvaried, difficult to detect and<br />\nrequire exceedingly difficult<br />\noperations. The failure of the<br />\nsurgeons to recognize one of the<br />\nlesions is usually fatal.<br />\nRile<br /><br />\nruuspnounth<br /><br />\nounum<br /><br />\ne<br /><br />\nquestion period. This Statement<br />\nwas read by Bers Monday morning<br /><br />\nwith my consent. Expecting an<br />\nintroduction from the Symposium<br />\nheads, we were put in an awkward<br />\nposition in attempting to make a<br />\nstatement without the knowledge<br />\nof Percy or the audience of the<br />\nprior agreement. Percy's belief that<br />\nit was a time for question\u00a7 and not<br />\nstatements prompted him to cut us<br />\nshort in deference to others who<br />\nmay have had questions.<br />\nAfter the Symposium, at a<br />\nreception for Percy (to /which we<br />\nwere invited by several people) we<br />\nquestioned Bers and Yaffe as to<br />\nwhat had happened. They stated<br />\n'they had told Senator Percy and<br />\nthat he had said he did not wish to<br />\nhear statements in such a short<br />\nsession. In presenting our petitions<br />\nto Percy and trying to give him at<br />\nleast parts of our statement and<br />\nquestion, we explained that we had<br />\nbeen told we would have the five<br />\nminutes and had not been allowed<br />\nthem. He told us he knew nothing<br />\nof it and called Steve and Dave<br />\nover to find out why he had not<br />\nbeen informed. Dave spoke to him<br />\nand needless to say, he and Steve<br />\nwere trapped into their deception.<br />\nGranted it is difficult to unravel<br />\noneself from a series of lies. Their<br />\ncover-up was weak and their<br />\napology in Tuesday's News-Letter<br />\nclearly does not reflect their actual<br />\nposition. Percy apologized for<br />\ncutting us off and graciously<br />\nagreed to personally deliver the<br /><br />\nmore massive infusion to arms,<br />\njets, weapons, technical advisors,<br />\nand even American pilots of<br />\nAmerican jets based in Greece or<br />\nTurkey. The U.S. warns Russia to<br />\nstay. out of the Mid-East. Who is<br />\nkidding whom? Or, notice the<br />\nzigzag of government statements.<br />\nOne day, Secretary of State<br />\nKissinger pronounces Soviet arms<br />\naid as \"moderate\" and solemnly<br />\nintones,\"the detente applies to the<br />\nMid-East or nowhere at all.\" The<br />\nnext day Secretary of Defense<br />\nSchlesinger (former CIA director)<br />\nand CIA Director William Colby<br />\ntestify to the House Arms Services<br />\nCommittee, and tell Congress that<br />\nthe \"Soviet airlift has been<br />\nominous...but the U.S. has already<br />\nfar exceeded (the Russian) in<br />\nmaterial via or massive shuttle.\" At<br />\nthe same time, reports the New<br />\nuric<br /><br />\ni Imes<br /><br />\nne<br /><br />\nauministration<br /><br />\n11<br /><br />\nas the U.S. pours \"the most<br />\nmodern weapons- into Israel. It is<br />\nall too easy to treat war material as<br />\na chess game, trading off Mig jets<br />\nfor Phantom jets, Sidewinder and<br />\nSkyhawk missiles for Sam and<br />\nFrog Soviet varieties.<br />\nAmong the weapons<br />\n\"furnished\" by the government in<br />\nthe latest Arab-Israeli War are<br />\nnapalm, cluster fragmentation<br />\nbombs, and the whole series of<br />\n\"recently developed\"<br />\nanti-personnel bombs and mines.<br />\nThe same weapons and \"methods\"<br />\nused by \"counter-insurgency forces<br />\nin the Mekong Delta, had been and<br />\nare being used in the Sinai Desert,<br />\nthe Golan Heights etc. As John<br />\nTompkins notes in The Weapons of<br />\nWorld War (page 116)1<br />\n-These anti-personnel weapons<br />\nrepresent a growing series of<br />\nmunitions in which the killing<br />\npower of conventional weapons<br />\nhas been made to approach that of<br />\nsmall tactical nuclear weapons.<br />\nThis was done by substituting<br />\ncontrolled fragments for the<br />\nrandom pieces created by the<br />\nexplosion of the conventional<br />\nshell.\"<br />\nThe above language may be<br />\noblique and abstract, but the effectof such weapons is all too horribly<br />\nclear--shredded man, beast, and<br />\nearth. The U.S. Air Force has even<br />\ngiven affectionate names to some<br />\nof these genocidal devices: \"lazy<br />\ndogs,\" \"butterfly bombs,\"<br />\n\"guavas,\" \"pineapples,\" \"mighty<br /><br />\nvicous than napalm, if one can say<br />\nsuch a thing. in the civilian<br />\nhospital at Can Tho, there were<br />\nmany who had a piece of white<br />\nphosphorous inside the flesh. It<br />\nwas still burning.\"<br />\nIn the meantime, the lies of the<br />\ngovernments concerned multiply as<br />\nthey inexorably must. As George<br />\nOrwell once wrote, \"In our time,<br />\npolitical language is by and large<br />\nlies in defense of the indefensible.\"<br />\nIt is the sheerest naivete to believe<br />\nin U.S. care for Israel, or Soviet<br />\nUnion care for Arab people. Under<br />\nthe guise 'of \"fraternal protection\"<br />\nthe super pow ers stalk death in the<br />\nMid-East, as elsewhere, using their<br />\n\"client States\" as hostages in a<br />\ncarefully modulated struggle for<br />\npolitical, economic, social and<br />\nmilitary control.<br />\nThree recent examples suffice to<br />\ndemonstrate this on-going<br />\nMachiavellian defense of murder.<br />\nConsider the circumstances of the<br />\nAmerican airlift to Israel, the<br />\nIsraeli wholesale violation of the<br />\ncease fire lines of October 22, the<br />\ndeception of the \"military alert\"<br />\nof U.S. forces. All fit into the same<br />\npattern of murder offstage,<br />\nduplicity onstage.<br />\nWhy is the United States so<br />\nmilitarily committed in the<br />\nMid -East? The government<br />\norchestrates public approval for<br />\narms aid to Israel by using the<br />\nexcuse of Soviet re-supplying of<br />\nEgyptian and Syrian armies. Thus,<br />\nthe United States managed an even<br /><br />\nbillion dollars to replace the jets<br />\n- given the<br />\nand --outer weapons<br /><br />\nIsraelis.<br />\nThe Israeli violation of the<br />\ncease-fire lines of October 22 fits<br />\ninto the pattern of grabbing more<br />\nand more territory in defense of<br />\n\"secure borders.\" The tragedy of<br />\nthis policy, the illusory nature of<br />\npeace thus obtained, the<br />\nconcomitant militarization of<br />\nIsraeli society, are all too<br />\ndepressingly clear. Major General<br />\nElazar, Israeli Chief of Staff had<br />\nvowed to \"break their bones one<br />\nby one.\" Yet, on October 21 in<br />\nMoscow, Henry Kissinger and<br />\nLeonid Brezhnev \"arranged\" a<br />\ncease-fire. The two governments<br />\nimmediately put forth a take-it or<br />\nleave-it joint resolution in the<br />\nUnited Nations Security Council,<br />\nyet neither government at that<br />\ntime revealed what had been<br />\nsecretly agreed to in Moscow,<br />\nmuch less the means for enforcing<br />\nthe cease-fire. [It is important to<br />\nalso note that all throughout the<br />\nwar the two superpowers were in<br />\nconstant communication, and that<br />\nboth governments used military<br />\nsatellites in space to gather<br />\ninformation.]<br />\nThe secret diplomacy contains<br />\nits own logic, its own built in<br />\nchecks and denial mechanisms.<br />\nKosygin goes to Cairo and<br />\nDamascus. Kissinger goes to<br />\nMoscow and then on to Tel-Aviv.<br />\nVirtually nothing of the content of<br />\nthese meetings is disseminated,<br />\nTHE<br /><br />\nexcept those selected portions<br />\nleaked deliberately to the press by<br />\none side or the other, for its own<br />\npurposes, to create a certain public<br />\nimpression. Thus, the international<br />\npress reports that Meir and Dayan<br />\nsay to Kissinger: \"Just give us<br />\nthree more days in Sinai.\"<br />\nSecretary Kissinger is quoted as<br />\nreplying, \"No, that's not possible.<br />\nThe cease-fire must take effect<br />\nnow.\" Once again, who is kidding<br />\nwhom? Could Israel have attacked<br />\nin the Sinai if the United States<br />\nhad explicitly warned her not to?<br />\nLastly, the U.S. military alert of<br />\nlast Wednesday night was but latest<br />\ncharade from a government that<br />\nwages secret war in Cambodia and<br />\nLaos, not to mention endless other<br />\nmatters. First, there is reason to<br />\nbelieve that in fact the U.S. and<br />\nthe Soviet Union had secretly<br />\nagreed to jointly police the<br />\nresponse to the howl at the United<br />\nNations. This is admittedly<br />\nspeculation. Nevertheless, at the<br />\nleast, one can state that there was<br />\nno military significance to the<br />\nalert. And, once again, at a press<br />\nconference the next day, Secretary<br />\nof Defense Schlesinger even<br />\ndelcared that \" the purpose of the<br />\nalert is diplomatic.\" Let's leave<br />\naside for the moment that the two<br />\nsuperpowers were \"in harmony\"<br />\nbefore the alert and after the alert,<br />\nbut suddenly not during the alert.<br />\nCollusion<br /><br />\nThere is neither detente, nor<br />\ncollaboration, nor open warfare<br />\nbetween the superpowers at this<br />\nmoment in the Middle-East.<br />\nRather, there is collusion.<br />\nNevertheless, even worse perhaps, a<br />\ncollusion using a public mask of<br />\nbrinkmanship, contains dangers of<br />\nescalation too. Then, for reasons<br />\nclear to no one, the American<br />\npeople are presented with a \"fait<br />\naccompli\": the committment of<br />\nU.S. troops, the danger of nuclear<br />\nconfrontation.<br />\nMost grievously, there is no<br />\nchance for peace in the Mid-East as<br />\nlong as Israel maintains the<br />\npsychology and actions of an<br />\noccupying army, and as long as<br />\nleaders like Golda Meir can persist<br />\nin the willful blindness of<br />\ndeclaring: \"The Palestinians.

It is estimated<br />\nthat only about 10 percent of all rapes<br />\nare reported, and of these,50 percent go<br />\nto court and one-third receive<br />\nconvictions.<br />\nOne woman suggested that the<br />\npunishment for rape conviction be made<br />\nmore nearly proportional to the degree of<br />\nthe crime. Instead of carrying the life<br />\nimprisonment sentence, it was suggested<br />\nthat, by viewing the crime as assault with<br />\na weapon, with the sentence being levied<br />\naccordingly. The reduction of the<br />\npunishment, woule likely yield more<br />\nconvictions, and, therefore, reduce the<br />\nchances of an assailant \"getting off the<br />\nhook.\"<br />\nIn a further effort to bring rape victims<br />\nto legal attention, the Center is<br />\nadvocating the establishment of a central<br />\nrape-treatment center for Baltimore city,<br />\nequiped with gynecologists and other<br />\npersonnel present to assist the confused<br /><br />\nvictim in the first hours following the<br />\noccurence of the crime.<br />\nMany rape victims shy away from the<br />\noften cold, insensitive atmosphere and<br />\ntreatment of the North East police<br />\nstation, where all rape victims are sent for<br />\nexamination. According to a social<br />\nworker at the station, a rape victim must<br />\nundergo impersonal interrogation,<br />\nfollowed by a medical examination in the<br />\n\"Sex Room\" by an \"on call\"<br />\ngynecologist. Considering that the<br />\nevidence of rape lasts approximately eight<br />\nhours, the time spent undergoing often<br />\nirrelevent questioning and waiting for a<br />\ngynecologist cuts into her chances of<br />\nexhibiting proof of being raped, Center<br />\nmembers contended.<br />\nThe proposed new center would not<br />\nrequire that rape victims attempt to<br />\nprosecute their assailants and risk public<br />\nembarrassment during possible courtroom<br />\ninvestigation into one's character.<br />\nAdcording to figures released thru the<br />\nMayor's office, Baltimore had 465 cases<br />\nof rape in 1972.<br /><br />\nto MaryPIRG, and could have included<br />\ndue payments with their tuition<br />\npayments.
