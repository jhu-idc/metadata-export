Did you have a good job lined up? Did<br />\nyou spend your summer at one of those sensational spots that everyone<br />\ndreams about? (Hawaii-Yellowstone-Disneyland) Were you able to work and<br />\nplay where you wanted to? If your answer to all of these questions wasn't yes,<br />\n\"it could have been.\" (If you think now is a poor time to think about summer<br />\njob opportunities, you're wrong. In the next 90 days some guys and gals will<br />\nbe lining up the really terrific jobs for next summer, while the multitudes will<br />\nwait till the last minute and scramble for what's left.)<br />\n<br />\nWHY? Because each year as winter ends, literally thousands of college students<br />\nthroughout the nation begin to investigate the potentials of summertime<br />\nemployment. In many cases, this is the beginning of one of the college<br />\nstudent's most frustrating and time consuming endeavors. Time after time the<br />\ngrandeur and excitement of the often dreamt of \"perfect summer job\" is<br />\nabandoned by necessity as the tremendous flood of summertime job seekers<br />\nsaturate the nation. It's generally a mad scramble for any kind of employment<br />\nanywhere in order to provide funds for next year's tuition, wardrobe,<br />\nactivities, etc. (Sound familiar?)<br />\nIn contrast to the foregoing statements, it's a known fact that there are<br />\nliterally thousands of fantastic summer job opportunities in fun-filled and<br />\nexciting locations all over this great land. O.K. so what's the problem? The<br />\nproblem is knowing where the opportunities are and getting there first! It's a<br />\nknown fact that the good jobs in the best areas with top conditions and pay<br />\nare filled by March 1st. (During the winter)<br />\nBelieve it or not, each year college students are being sought after to fill<br />\nemployment requirements at such exciting locations as national parks, resort<br />\nfacilities, guest ranches, summer camps, and various seasonal industries<br />\nthroughout the nation.<br />\nNow through the facilities of OPPORTUNITY RESEARCH, we can provide<br />\ncollege guys and gals with the opportunity to prove the old adage, \"the early<br />\nbird gets the worm.\" Through our facilities we provide basic information on<br />\nsummer job potentials for many of the sought after recreational and<br />\ngeographic locations in the USA. That's right, once you have registered with<br />\nOpportunity Research as a qualified college student you will be entitled to<br />\nreceive valuable information pertaining to employment opportunities, recreational facilities, housing and cost of living for specific areas of your choice.<br />\nYou tell us where you would like to work this coming summer and we will<br />\nsupply you with specific opportunity information pertaining to the area of<br />\nyour choice. We do not provide jobs, or a placement service. We'll tell you<br />\nabout the many opportunities; it's up to you to get the job. However, we will<br />\nhelp by telling you how to apply and we'll give you some valuable information<br />\non form and presentation for your inquiry and application. So, what's the cost<br />\nto you? Very little, there is a one-time registration fee ($5) which makes our<br />\nservices available to you as long as you are a registered college student. After<br />\nregistration you may apply for and receive specific information about any area<br />\nof your choice. There is a flat rate charge of $1 for handling and processing of<br />\neach personalized inquiry. That's all there is to it! There are no additional fees,<br />\nsubscriptions, renewals, or hidden charges. With the advent of modern<br />\nspace-age electronic processing equipment and personalized service, Opportunity Research will help put you where the action is. Simply fill out the<br />\nregistration form and send it along with your $5 (one-time registration fee) to:<br />\nOpportunity Research, Department SJO, P. 0. Box 98, Aurora, Oregon<br />\n97002. Within a few days you will receive a \"Summer '72\" bulletin with<br />\nvaluable information on \"how to do it\" and numerous suggestions for<br />\nopportunities that are perhaps just waiting for you to apply.<br />\nOnce you have registered you may also wish to use the Opportunity Research<br />\nresources for employment or activities during other seasonal periods such as<br />\nChristmas vacations, and Spring vacations. You may be able to earn while you<br />\nplay. (By this time a vast majority of those who have read this ad will more<br />\nthan likely shrug their shoulders, ignore the facts and as a result will join the<br />\nmultitudes in the mad scramble next May. Remember there are many more<br />\njob seekers than there are jobs. However, there will be a few aggressive<br />\nindividuals (perhaps you?) who will be motivated into being one of the lucky<br />\nones next summer.) Remember there are numerous opportunities every year<br />\n<br />\nthat are probably just what you are looking for. (The beaches at<br />\nWaikiki-Grand Canyon?)

This goal definitely<br />\nwas often ignored in my day,<br />\nand it is at least equally so today<br />\nwith the growth of student<br />\npolitical activism.<br />\nThe editorial in question is a<br />\nperfect example of \"proof in a<br />\ncircle,\" which is proof based on<br />\npostulates which assume the<br />\ncorrectness of the conclusions. I<br />\npersonally do not have any<br />\nfeelings on ROTC per se, except<br />\nthat the student should be<br />\nentitled to make his own choice,<br />\nand that choice should be free of<br />\nharassment by others. (Editorials<br />\nsuch as \"ROTC Decline\" as<br />\nwritten provide incentive for<br />\nsuch harassment.)<br />\nDon't forget, many brilliant<br />\nstudents have only been able to<br />\ncomplete college as a result of<br />\nROTC support. And I have two<br />\nsons who have served in the<br />\nArmy and found it not to be<br />\n\"both useless and harmful.\"<br />\nOf course you show your<br />\ncolors in your statement<br />\n\"institutions as deep-rooted and<br />\ndestructive as the military.\" If<br />\nyou had plainly included all<br />\n<br />\nthe news-letter is published twice each week during the school year by the<br />\nstudents of the johns hopkins university, homewood campus, baltimore,<br />\nmaryland. editorial and business correspondence should be addressed to box<br />\n1230, the johns hopkins university, baltimore, maryland 21218; telephone<br />\n301-366-3300, extension 1308. subscriptions $8 per annum, member, columbia scholastic press association.<br />\n<br />\nBRP warning<br />\nThe Blue Ribbon Panel has been sent back to its task<br />\nby Dean Benton and the Acedemic Council who finally got<br />\naround to looking at their preliminary report at a meeting<br />\nlast week. A closed meeting of course, with all of the<br />\nmembers pledged to secrecy as to what transpired. We do<br />\nknow that Benton found the report lacking, and called for<br />\n\"a broad imaginative look at undergraduate education.\" If<br />\nthe Academic Council had had such a view for the past few<br />\nyears, the Blue Ribbon Panel wouldn't even be necessary,<br />\n'but that is the subject of many other editorials. This one is<br />\nsimply a warning. If the Blue Ribbon Panel does its job<br />\nand comes up with the solution to the undergraduate's<br />\neducational problems, the Academic Council won't like it.<br />\nSuch a solution will not be the Dean's utopic vision of a<br />\nsmall group of junior graduate students that would make<br />\nundergraduate life even duller than it is today. The only<br />\nsolutions possible will pull senior professors, such as those<br />\nthat make up the Academic Council, out of their laboratories and carrels and put them in the classroom. There<br />\nhave been a few tentative moves in this direction, but to<br />\nmake the undergraduate curriculum viable, it will be necessary that the fundamental stance of this research-oriented<br />\nUniversity be drastically altered, and we don't think the<br />\nAcademic Council will be willing to do this.<br />\n<br />\nFrat memories<br />\nFraternities on campus have been battered by changing<br />\ntimes, low interest and poor leadership. There are now<br />\nonly eight frats on campus with a total membership of<br />\n300, and four of them are in danger of folding next year.<br />\nOver the last few years, a number of fraternities have already closed. At a school like Hopkins, with a fragmented<br />\nsocial life, fraternities might possibly have served some useful function. But with their incredibly archaic rules, activities and concerns, they became irrelevant to the social<br />\nneeds of today's student.<br />\nBefore they completely fade into obscurity, going the<br />\nway of the raccoon coat, Hopkins students might pause<br />\nbefore they roll the next joint for a moment of fond memory of the raucous joys of fraternity life. Who can ever<br />\nforget the hectic days of rush, when freshmen waited<br />\nanxiously in their dorm rooms for the streams of smiling<br />\nfrat members, each promising the height of orgiastic revelry? Of course, the best times were the fabulous rush parties, when dozens of sweaty students packed into a small<br />\nbasement to pour beer over each other and grope at passing girls. For those who actually joined a fraternity, there<br />\nwas the opportunity to go through stomach-churning initiation rites and live in ramshackle houses with their charming fraternity brothers. All this, unfortunately, may soon<br />\nbe gone, a loss sure to be felt by everyone at Hopkins.<br />\n<br />\nHuman Rights<br />\n<br />\n\"Got To Throw Out A Few People<br />\nTo Keep Gaining Altitude\"<br />\n<br />\ncontributing reason for<br />\nmilitary, specifically, the<br />\ncommunist and fascist tyranny.)<br />\nRussian, Iron Curtain, Bamboo<br />\nCurtain, third world, as well as<br />\nA review of our recent national<br />\nours of the free world, I could<br />\nhistory as well as that of the<br />\npass you off as a starry-eyed<br />\nuniversities clearly shows this<br />\nidealist who would possibly<br />\nrelation.

That date has<br />\nnot been determined.<br />\n\"I feel there is a great deal to<br />\nbe accomplished at the Med<br />\nSchool,\" said Morgan. \"If I<br />\ndidn't think so, I wouldn't have<br />\nagreed to take the post.\"<br />\nMorgan indicated that there<br />\nwere problems at the<br />\ninstitution, but he said that it<br />\nwould be \"premature\" to discuss<br />\nthem at this time. \"I don't reach<br />\nconclusions quickly,\" he added.<br />\nThe Advisory Board of the<br />\nSchool of Medicine, meeting as a<br />\ncommittee of the whole,<br />\nunanimously recommended to<br />\nEisenhower that Morgan be<br />\nnamed to replace Rogers. That<br />\naction has been approved by the<br />\nBoard of Trustees, according to<br />\nEisenhower, but the actual<br />\ntransfer of roles will not take<br />\nplace until Rogers offically<br />\nresigns.<br />\nRogers was out of town when<br />\nEisenhower announced that the<br />\nDean had asked to be replaced,<br />\nand has not been availible for<br />\ncomment since that time. Until<br />\nRogers tenders his resignation, a<br />\nprocess which apparently entails<br />\nwriting a -letter and setting a<br />\ndeparture date, he will continue<br />\nas Dean of the School.<br />\nIn the interim period, which<br />\nWill reportedly continue for<br />\nsome months, Morgan will work<br />\ndirectly with Rogers to ensure<br />\nWhat Eisenhower called \"a<br />\nsmooth transistion.\" The two<br /><br />\nmen will also undertake a<br />\n\"comprehensive review\" of the<br />\ninterrelationships within the<br />\nMedical Institutions, and will<br />\nwork together on all policy,<br />\nprogram and budgetary<br />\nproblems.<br />\nIn the past few years the<br />\nMedical School, like most<br />\nUniversity divisions, has<br />\nencountered a continuing money<br />\ncrisis. \"We have number of<br />\nproblems at the School,\"<br />\ncommented Morgan. \"Many of<br />\nthem are financial, and many<br />\ninvolve establishing better<br />\nrelationships within the<br />\nhospital.\"<br />\nMorgan reports that he is<br />\n\"looking forward\" to working<br />\nwith students in his new post as<br />\nDean. \"We have a viable and<br />\nvaluable student organization<br />\nhere at the Medical School,\" he<br />\nsaid. He anticipates a close<br />\nrelationship with the student<br />\ngroup.<br />\nThe events leading to Roger's<br />\nplan to step down have never<br />\nbeen made clear. Eisenhower<br />\nreported that Rogers informed<br />\nhim in July that he wished to be<br />\nrelieved of the position. \"It was<br />\ntotally his decision. There were<br />\nno outside pressures influencing<br />\nhim,\" Eisenhower said in<br />\nannouncing the planned<br />\nresignation.<br />\n\"As I understand it, Dean<br />\nRogers felt that he has gone as<br />\nfar as he can here, and would<br />\nlike to move on to other things,\"<br />\nMorgan said. \"I've worked<br />\nclosely with Dr. Rogers in the<br />\npast and expect to work closely<br />\nwith him in the future,\" he<br />\nstated.<br />\n\"Dr. Rogers is only 45 years<br />\nold.

The Office of<br />\nEducation informed CODE that<br />\nthis installment would be late ,<br />\nand suggested that Director<br />\nDoug Reid seek a temporary<br />\nloan from the University to<br />\ncover its expenses until the<br />\ninstallment arrives.

Did you have a good job lined up? Did<br />\nyou spend your summer at one of those sensational spots that everyone<br />\ndreams about? (Hawaii-Yellowstone-Disneyland) Were you able to work and<br />\nplay where you wanted to? If your answer to all of these questions wasn't yes,<br />\n\"it could have been.\" (If you think now is a poor time to think about summer<br />\njob opportunities, you're wrong. In the next 90 days some guys and gals will<br />\nbe lining up the really terrific jobs for next summer, while the multitudes will<br />\nwait till the last minute and scramble for what's left.)<br /><br />\nWHY? Because each year as winter ends, literally thousands of college students<br />\nthroughout the nation begin to investigate the potentials of summertime<br />\nemployment. In many cases, this is the beginning of one of the college<br />\nstudent's most frustrating and time consuming endeavors. Time after time the<br />\ngrandeur and excitement of the often dreamt of \"perfect summer job\" is<br />\nabandoned by necessity as the tremendous flood of summertime job seekers<br />\nsaturate the nation. It's generally a mad scramble for any kind of employment<br />\nanywhere in order to provide funds for next year's tuition, wardrobe,<br />\nactivities, etc. (Sound familiar?)<br />\nIn contrast to the foregoing statements, it's a known fact that there are<br />\nliterally thousands of fantastic summer job opportunities in fun-filled and<br />\nexciting locations all over this great land. O.K. so what's the problem? The<br />\nproblem is knowing where the opportunities are and getting there first! It's a<br />\nknown fact that the good jobs in the best areas with top conditions and pay<br />\nare filled by March 1st. (During the winter)<br />\nBelieve it or not, each year college students are being sought after to fill<br />\nemployment requirements at such exciting locations as national parks, resort<br />\nfacilities, guest ranches, summer camps, and various seasonal industries<br />\nthroughout the nation.<br />\nNow through the facilities of OPPORTUNITY RESEARCH, we can provide<br />\ncollege guys and gals with the opportunity to prove the old adage, \"the early<br />\nbird gets the worm.\" Through our facilities we provide basic information on<br />\nsummer job potentials for many of the sought after recreational and<br />\ngeographic locations in the USA. That's right, once you have registered with<br />\nOpportunity Research as a qualified college student you will be entitled to<br />\nreceive valuable information pertaining to employment opportunities, recreational facilities, housing and cost of living for specific areas of your choice.<br />\nYou tell us where you would like to work this coming summer and we will<br />\nsupply you with specific opportunity information pertaining to the area of<br />\nyour choice. We do not provide jobs, or a placement service. We'll tell you<br />\nabout the many opportunities; it's up to you to get the job. However, we will<br />\nhelp by telling you how to apply and we'll give you some valuable information<br />\non form and presentation for your inquiry and application. So, what's the cost<br />\nto you? Very little, there is a one-time registration fee ($5) which makes our<br />\nservices available to you as long as you are a registered college student. After<br />\nregistration you may apply for and receive specific information about any area<br />\nof your choice. There is a flat rate charge of $1 for handling and processing of<br />\neach personalized inquiry. That's all there is to it! There are no additional fees,<br />\nsubscriptions, renewals, or hidden charges. With the advent of modern<br />\nspace-age electronic processing equipment and personalized service, Opportunity Research will help put you where the action is. Simply fill out the<br />\nregistration form and send it along with your $5 (one-time registration fee) to:<br />\nOpportunity Research, Department SJO, P. 0. Box 98, Aurora, Oregon<br />\n97002. Within a few days you will receive a \"Summer '72\" bulletin with<br />\nvaluable information on \"how to do it\" and numerous suggestions for<br />\nopportunities that are perhaps just waiting for you to apply.<br />\nOnce you have registered you may also wish to use the Opportunity Research<br />\nresources for employment or activities during other seasonal periods such as<br />\nChristmas vacations, and Spring vacations. You may be able to earn while you<br />\nplay. (By this time a vast majority of those who have read this ad will more<br />\nthan likely shrug their shoulders, ignore the facts and as a result will join the<br />\nmultitudes in the mad scramble next May. Remember there are many more<br />\njob seekers than there are jobs. However, there will be a few aggressive<br />\nindividuals (perhaps you?) who will be motivated into being one of the lucky<br />\nones next summer.) Remember there are numerous opportunities every year<br /><br />\nthat are probably just what you are looking for. (The beaches at<br />\nWaikiki-Grand Canyon?)

This goal definitely<br />\nwas often ignored in my day,<br />\nand it is at least equally so today<br />\nwith the growth of student<br />\npolitical activism.<br />\nThe editorial in question is a<br />\nperfect example of \"proof in a<br />\ncircle,\" which is proof based on<br />\npostulates which assume the<br />\ncorrectness of the conclusions. I<br />\npersonally do not have any<br />\nfeelings on ROTC per se, except<br />\nthat the student should be<br />\nentitled to make his own choice,<br />\nand that choice should be free of<br />\nharassment by others. (Editorials<br />\nsuch as \"ROTC Decline\" as<br />\nwritten provide incentive for<br />\nsuch harassment.)<br />\nDon't forget, many brilliant<br />\nstudents have only been able to<br />\ncomplete college as a result of<br />\nROTC support. And I have two<br />\nsons who have served in the<br />\nArmy and found it not to be<br />\n\"both useless and harmful.\"<br />\nOf course you show your<br />\ncolors in your statement<br />\n\"institutions as deep-rooted and<br />\ndestructive as the military.\" If<br />\nyou had plainly included all<br /><br />\nthe news-letter is published twice each week during the school year by the<br />\nstudents of the johns hopkins university, homewood campus, baltimore,<br />\nmaryland. editorial and business correspondence should be addressed to box<br />\n1230, the johns hopkins university, baltimore, maryland 21218; telephone<br />\n301-366-3300, extension 1308. subscriptions $8 per annum, member, columbia scholastic press association.<br /><br />\nBRP warning<br />\nThe Blue Ribbon Panel has been sent back to its task<br />\nby Dean Benton and the Acedemic Council who finally got<br />\naround to looking at their preliminary report at a meeting<br />\nlast week. A closed meeting of course, with all of the<br />\nmembers pledged to secrecy as to what transpired. We do<br />\nknow that Benton found the report lacking, and called for<br />\n\"a broad imaginative look at undergraduate education.\" If<br />\nthe Academic Council had had such a view for the past few<br />\nyears, the Blue Ribbon Panel wouldn't even be necessary,<br />\n'but that is the subject of many other editorials. This one is<br />\nsimply a warning. If the Blue Ribbon Panel does its job<br />\nand comes up with the solution to the undergraduate's<br />\neducational problems, the Academic Council won't like it.<br />\nSuch a solution will not be the Dean's utopic vision of a<br />\nsmall group of junior graduate students that would make<br />\nundergraduate life even duller than it is today. The only<br />\nsolutions possible will pull senior professors, such as those<br />\nthat make up the Academic Council, out of their laboratories and carrels and put them in the classroom. There<br />\nhave been a few tentative moves in this direction, but to<br />\nmake the undergraduate curriculum viable, it will be necessary that the fundamental stance of this research-oriented<br />\nUniversity be drastically altered, and we don't think the<br />\nAcademic Council will be willing to do this.<br /><br />\nFrat memories<br />\nFraternities on campus have been battered by changing<br />\ntimes, low interest and poor leadership. There are now<br />\nonly eight frats on campus with a total membership of<br />\n300, and four of them are in danger of folding next year.<br />\nOver the last few years, a number of fraternities have already closed. At a school like Hopkins, with a fragmented<br />\nsocial life, fraternities might possibly have served some useful function. But with their incredibly archaic rules, activities and concerns, they became irrelevant to the social<br />\nneeds of today's student.<br />\nBefore they completely fade into obscurity, going the<br />\nway of the raccoon coat, Hopkins students might pause<br />\nbefore they roll the next joint for a moment of fond memory of the raucous joys of fraternity life. Who can ever<br />\nforget the hectic days of rush, when freshmen waited<br />\nanxiously in their dorm rooms for the streams of smiling<br />\nfrat members, each promising the height of orgiastic revelry? Of course, the best times were the fabulous rush parties, when dozens of sweaty students packed into a small<br />\nbasement to pour beer over each other and grope at passing girls. For those who actually joined a fraternity, there<br />\nwas the opportunity to go through stomach-churning initiation rites and live in ramshackle houses with their charming fraternity brothers. All this, unfortunately, may soon<br />\nbe gone, a loss sure to be felt by everyone at Hopkins.<br /><br />\nHuman Rights<br /><br />\n\"Got To Throw Out A Few People<br />\nTo Keep Gaining Altitude\"<br /><br />\ncontributing reason for<br />\nmilitary, specifically, the<br />\ncommunist and fascist tyranny.)<br />\nRussian, Iron Curtain, Bamboo<br />\nCurtain, third world, as well as<br />\nA review of our recent national<br />\nours of the free world, I could<br />\nhistory as well as that of the<br />\npass you off as a starry-eyed<br />\nuniversities clearly shows this<br />\nidealist who would possibly<br />\nrelation.

The<br />\nDiplomats dominated nearly<br />\nevery phase of the contest to<br />\neasily earn their second straight<br />\nvictory of 1971 before a sparse,<br />\nrain-soaked homecoming crowd.<br />\nThe outcome was in sharp<br /><br />\ncontrast to the Blue Jays'<br />\nopening loss against Muhlenberg,<br />\ndecided on a touchdown with no<br />\ntime remaining. The Diplomats<br />\neffectively bottled up Hopkins<br />\nthroughout the game to earn<br />\ntheir first victory over the Blue<br />\nJays since 1969 with<br />\ncomparative ease.<br />\nThe Diplomats promptly got<br />\non the board after taking the<br />\nopening kickoff.

Dan Truskey returned a<br />\nThomas punt 17 yards to the<br />\nBlue Jay 28 to set up the brief<br />\ntouchdown drive.
