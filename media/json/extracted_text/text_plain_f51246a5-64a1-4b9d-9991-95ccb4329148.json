Two fashionable architects were<br />\ncommissioned to design the colonial-style<br />\npavilions. They created casino-like structures<br />\n<br />\n <br />\n<br />\n15<br />\n<br />\nopen to the breezes.

The houses of hollow tile<br />\ncovered with stucco as well as the<br />\ncurvilinear street plan, were designed<br />\nin the Olmsted-style by Edward H.<br />\nBoulton, president of the Roland Park<br />\nCompany.

This building, along with the<br />\nadjacent Dunleer and Dundalk<br />\nbuildings, are the major commerecial<br />\nbuildings which comprise the shopping<br />\ncenter of Dundalk. The Dunleer and<br />\nDunkirk buildings were constructed in<br />\n1929. Designed in the Colonial Revival<br />\nStyle, they are nearly identical in<br />\nappearance. The Dundalk Building is<br />\nthe oldest commercial building in Dun-<br />\ndalk.

The station was designed by<br />\narchitect William Emory and was built<br />\nin 1920. The building originally hous-<br />\ned both the police and fire depart-<br />\nments.

Symbolizing that company,<br />\na letter \u201cD\u201d decorates the area just<br />\nabove the main entrance.

Numbers One and Two<br />\nFriendship Circle were originally<br />\ndesigned to house unmarried shipyard<br />\nworkers.

The houses of hollow tile<br />\ncovered with stucco as well as the<br />\ncurvilinear street plan, were designed<br />\nin the Olmsted-style by Edward H.<br />\nBoulton, president of the Roland Park<br />\nCompany.

The station was designed by<br />\narchitect William Emory and was built<br />\nin 1920. The building originally hous-<br />\ned both the police and fire depart-<br />\nments.
