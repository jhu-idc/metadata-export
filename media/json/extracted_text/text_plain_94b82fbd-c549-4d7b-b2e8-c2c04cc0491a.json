What Sigafoos was<br />\ndoing in Java is, incidentally, quite an odd little story. Sigafoos<br />\nwas a Parisian born and bred. By day one could always find<br />\nhim at a sidewalk cafe, sipping barley water and ogling the<br />\ngirls; each night he went to a fashjonable casino where he<br />\ngambled heavily at roulette and go-fish; in between times he<br />\nworked on his stamp collection, which was one of the largest<br />\nin Paris.<br />\n<br />\n4e4eVitrite/7.<br />\n4.<br />\n<br />\nWell sir, one summer Sigafoos lost his entire fortune gambling<br />\nat the casino.

Until now<br />\nthe nature of their correspondence, though friendly, had been<br />\nstrictly philatelic, but in this new letter Lotus Petal declared<br />\nthat although she had never laid eyek on Sigafoos, she loved<br />\nhim and wanted to marry him. She said she was eighteen years<br />\nold, beautiful and docile, and her father, the richest man in the<br />\ntribe, had agreed to give half his fortune to the husband of her<br />\nchoice. Sigafoos, penniless and desperate, immediately booked<br />\npassage for Java.<br />\nThe first sight of his prospective bride failed to delight Sigafoos. She was, as she said, beautiful \u2014but only by local standards. Sigafoos had serious doubts that her pointed scarlet teeth<br />\nand the chicken bones banging from her ears would be considered chic along the Champs Elysees.<br />\nBut sobering as was the sight of Lotus Petal, Sigafoos had<br />\nan even greater disappointment coining when he met her father.<br />\nThe old gentleman was, as Lotus Petal claimed, the richest man<br />\nin his<br />\nin the tribe, but, unfortunately, the medium of exchange<br />\ntribe was prune pits.<br />\nwas<br />\nSigafoos took one look at the mound of prune pits which<br />\njungle,<br />\nthe<br />\ninto<br />\noff<br />\nstomped<br />\nand<br />\nteeth,<br />\nhis<br />\nhis dowry, gnashed<br />\nStompSwearing vilely and kicking at whatever lay in his path.<br />\nover a<br />\nkicked<br />\nSigafoos<br />\nthus,<br />\ning thus, swearing thus, kicking<br />\nout to<br />\n1\u2014turned<br />\nknow<br />\nyou<br />\ndo<br />\nt<br />\nwhich\u2014wha<br />\nheap of old bones<br />\nbe Pithecanthropus Erectus!<br />\nman<br />\nBut I disgress.

Jack<br />\nKotowski, with a single and a<br />\ndouble, and Bill Karpovicz, with<br />\na single and a triple, led the<br />\nHopkins batters.

But most important it is a time when the alumnus<br />\ncan at first hand observe the changes, the progress, the<br />\noverall improvement of his alma mater.<br />\nThis is especially true at Johns Hopkins, a university<br />\ndedicated to constant improvement and progress in all<br />\nfields of knowledge and research. To provide the alumnus<br />\nwith an opportunity to come in close contact with her<br />\ndevelopment and reawaken him to the responsibility he<br />\nwill always have to aid her, financially as well as via public<br />\nrelations, an Alumni Homecoming becomes the most necessary and worthwhile event possible.<br />\nTherefore may the alumnus return with a feeling of<br />\ngratitude to his alma mater and a sense of pride in her<br />\naccomplishments.

What Sigafoos was<br />\ndoing in Java is, incidentally, quite an odd little story. Sigafoos<br />\nwas a Parisian born and bred. By day one could always find<br />\nhim at a sidewalk cafe, sipping barley water and ogling the<br />\ngirls; each night he went to a fashjonable casino where he<br />\ngambled heavily at roulette and go-fish; in between times he<br />\nworked on his stamp collection, which was one of the largest<br />\nin Paris.<br /><br />\n4e4eVitrite/7.<br />\n4.<br /><br />\nWell sir, one summer Sigafoos lost his entire fortune gambling<br />\nat the casino.

Until now<br />\nthe nature of their correspondence, though friendly, had been<br />\nstrictly philatelic, but in this new letter Lotus Petal declared<br />\nthat although she had never laid eyek on Sigafoos, she loved<br />\nhim and wanted to marry him. She said she was eighteen years<br />\nold, beautiful and docile, and her father, the richest man in the<br />\ntribe, had agreed to give half his fortune to the husband of her<br />\nchoice. Sigafoos, penniless and desperate, immediately booked<br />\npassage for Java.<br />\nThe first sight of his prospective bride failed to delight Sigafoos. She was, as she said, beautiful \u2014but only by local standards. Sigafoos had serious doubts that her pointed scarlet teeth<br />\nand the chicken bones banging from her ears would be considered chic along the Champs Elysees.<br />\nBut sobering as was the sight of Lotus Petal, Sigafoos had<br />\nan even greater disappointment coining when he met her father.<br />\nThe old gentleman was, as Lotus Petal claimed, the richest man<br />\nin his<br />\nin the tribe, but, unfortunately, the medium of exchange<br />\ntribe was prune pits.<br />\nwas<br />\nSigafoos took one look at the mound of prune pits which<br />\njungle,<br />\nthe<br />\ninto<br />\noff<br />\nstomped<br />\nand<br />\nteeth,<br />\nhis<br />\nhis dowry, gnashed<br />\nStompSwearing vilely and kicking at whatever lay in his path.<br />\nover a<br />\nkicked<br />\nSigafoos<br />\nthus,<br />\ning thus, swearing thus, kicking<br />\nout to<br />\n1\u2014turned<br />\nknow<br />\nyou<br />\ndo<br />\nt<br />\nwhich\u2014wha<br />\nheap of old bones<br />\nbe Pithecanthropus Erectus!<br />\nman<br />\nBut I disgress.

Ey had previously against Swarthmore turned<br />\nin the first Jay shutout in years.<br />\nThe Jays collected six hits and<br />\nhad men on base in six innings,<br />\nbut could only score once,<br />\nstranding eight runners. Jack<br />\nKotowski, with a single and a<br />\ndouble, and Bill Karpovicz, with<br />\na single and a triple, led the<br />\nHopkins batters. Leading Washington was catcher Bragg, who<br />\nscored all three runs, and collected a home run in the<br />\nprocess.<br />\nKarpowicz singled in the Hopkins first, but was left stranded.<br />\nBragg led off the Sho'men first<br />\nwith a walk, and stole second on<br />\nthe next pitch. He scored on a<br />\nBlue-Jay error on the next play.<br />\nKarpowicz Drives in Run<br />\nThe Jays went down in 1-2-3<br />\nfashion in the second and third<br />\ninnings. Washington wasted a<br />\nsingle in the second, but picked<br />\na second run on Bragg's homer<br />\nin the third.<br />\nIn the Hopkins fourth, Kotowski led off with a single, and<br />\nscored on a booming triple by<br />\nKarpowicz, but the Jay center<br />\nfielder was left stranded three<br /><br />\nquarters of the way around, as<br />\nthe next three batters went out.<br />\nHopkins went out in order in<br />\nthe fifth, while Washington<br />\nwasted a fourth inning double<br />\nand two fifth inning singles.<br />\nThe Jays threatened in the<br />\nsixth, as Kotowski doubled and<br />\nAl Figinski walked, but, once<br />\nagain, they died on base. Third<br />\nsacker Mary Jones walked to<br />\nopen the seventh, was sacrificed<br />\nto second, and was left stranded.<br />\nThe Sho'men were put down in<br />\norder in the sixth, but a single,<br />\na stolen base, and another hit<br />\nscored Bragg again in the<br />\nseventh.<br />\nClosest Hopkins Rally<br />\nThe eighth inning saw the<br />\nJays put on their closest rally<br />\nof the day. Sol DeSwaan<br />\nsingled, and Bill Karpowicz<br />\nwalked with one out. Co-captain<br />\nFiginski took first on a fielder's<br />\nchoice as Karpowicz was thrown<br />\nout, and DeSwaan took third.<br />\nSecond sacker Danny Zelman<br />\nthen sent out a hot smash in the<br />\nhole between second and third.<br />\nWashington<br />\nSomehow, the<br />\nshortstop came up with the ball,<br />\nand whipped a throw in the direction of second base. Figinski<br />\nslid in, beating the throw to<br />\nsecond, and then watched the<br />\numpire call him out, as the<br />\nthrow arrived a second later.<br />\nThis bad call cost the Jays at<br />\nleast one run and perhaps the<br />\nopportunity of tying the game.<br />\nWashington went down in<br />\norder under Ey's pitching in the<br />\neighth, but Hopkins was not fin<br />\nished yet. With two down in<br />\nthe ninth, pinch hitter Jim<br />\nClark clipped a single to left,<br />\nputting the tying run at the<br />\nplate. But pinch runner Dick<br />\nKoslowski was left stranded as<br />\nEy struck out to end the game.<br /><br />\n(Continued from Page 7)<br />\nThe Hopkins varsity stickmen<br />\nplayed a lacklustre, if not mediocre, game in defeating Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, 19-7,<br />\nlast week at Troy, N.
