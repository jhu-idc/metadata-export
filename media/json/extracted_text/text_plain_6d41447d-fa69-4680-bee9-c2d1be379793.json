Campbell,<br />\nA. B. '05, the sponsor for the Equal<br />\nSuffrage Bill, has introduced an<br />\nAct to propose a new constitutional<br />\namendment for the restriction of<br />\nthe suffrage of the ignorant. Mr.<br />\nCampbell lays great stress on the<br />\nfact that the proposed amendment<br />\nwill not in the least interfere with<br />\nthe rights of men now voting; the<br />\nsimple purpose of the amendment<br />\nis to improve the intelligence of<br />\nthe electorate. If this amendment<br />\nshould pass, one weighty argument<br />\nagainst equal suffrage\u2014that negro<br />\nwomen should have equal political<br />\nrights with white women\u2014would<br />\nbe considerably less weighty.<br />\n<br />\nttrtiril Art Tompattg<br />\na24 N. flinarit grtrut<br />\n31aqiarttra and !Realm In<br />\n<br />\nNing Artg<br />\n<br />\nRAM<br />\n<br />\nThrum Nratnri) Col-rutin and Prouipth; at<br />\nilitOrratr Vrirro.<br />\n<br />\nCALENDAR OF COMING EVENTS<br />\nMonday, February 5<br />\n5 P.

Nitobe's Lectures.<br />\n<br />\nMonday last, Dr. Nitobe presented in the concert hall of the<br />\nAcademy of Music, his sixth lecture<br />\non Japan. His topic for that afternoon was \"Moral Ideals and Morals.\" The inclement weather did<br />\nnot diminish the usual large attendance.<br />\nDr. Nitobe denied that the Japanese are people who are immoral<br />\nor have no fixed ideals.<br />\n\"A feeling of great patriotism<br />\ncharacterizes our people,\" he said.<br />\nDr. Nitobe has frequently spoken<br />\nhis lectures of the devotion of the<br />\nJapanese to their Emperor. Monday he said: \"The love for the<br />\nEmperor is one of the characteristics of our life.\" According to the<br />\nlecturer, the Japanese have as much<br />\npaternal affection as Americans, but<br />\nthat they have also filial affection,<br />\nand consider the rights of the son,<br />\nas well as the rights ,of the parents.<br />\nOn Thursday, Dr. Nitobe illustrated his lecture with lantern slides.<br />\nHe also spoke extemporaneously,<br />\nforsaking his manuscript. He said<br />\nthat Japan is largely mountainous,<br />\nonly about 13 per cent. being under<br />\ncultivation, yet 60 per cent, of the<br />\ninhabitants are engaged in agricultural pursuits.<br />\nThe American popular idea is<br />\nthat the Japanese eat rice as their<br />\nmain article of food. Dr. Nitobe<br />\nstated that this is erroneous. He<br />\nsaid that the poorer people do not<br />\neat rice, because it costs too much.<br />\nThe people who do eat rice always<br />\naccompany such a diet with beans.<br />\nThe Japanese also have an immense<br />\nradish, which forms an important<br />\npart of the food supply.<br />\n\"There are few millionaires in<br />\nJapan,\" he concluded, \"for we are<br />\na poor nation.\"<br />\n<br />\nThe Medical Standard Book Co.<br />\n307 N.

Would not the publication of the pines of men elected<br />\nto the fraternities seem to confer<br />\na certain sort of distinction upon<br />\nthose men? Would it not cause<br />\nelection to a fraternity to come to<br />\nbe considered in the light of an<br />\nhonor? Would it not tend to alter<br />\nthe character of fraternities from<br />\nPrivate groups of congenial spirits<br />\nto public organizations? Under<br />\nexisting conditions it is no particular distinction to belong to a fraternity\u2014to be a friend of Will<br />\nSmith and his set, or of Jim Jones<br />\nand his set.

He urged the<br />\nmen who would try for the team<br />\nto assume the right attitude toward<br />\nthe manner of coaching, and hoped<br />\nthat no candidate would take his corrections personally. He announced<br />\nthe first practice for Wednesday of<br />\nthis week, at 2.15; the second for<br />\nSaturday, at 1.30.<br />\nDr. Roulston was the next speaker. He dispelled the impression<br />\nthat he had been made an adviser of<br />\nthe team because he had been a<br />\none-time \"star,\" which he thought<br />\nhad its birth in the mind of some<br />\nenterprising reporter. In his day<br />\nthere were nine at the organization<br />\nmeeting, who elected a captain, and<br />\nWho, in turn, set a day for the first<br />\nPractice. Four candidates appeared<br />\non that day, the captain not among<br />\nthem, who, it was found out, was<br />\nPlaying golf'.

His topic for that afternoon was \"Moral Ideals and Morals.\" The inclement weather did<br />\nnot diminish the usual large attendance.<br />\nDr. Nitobe denied that the Japanese are people who are immoral<br />\nor have no fixed ideals.<br />\n\"A feeling of great patriotism<br />\ncharacterizes our people,\" he said.<br />\nDr. Nitobe has frequently spoken<br />\nhis lectures of the devotion of the<br />\nJapanese to their Emperor. Monday he said: \"The love for the<br />\nEmperor is one of the characteristics of our life.\" According to the<br />\nlecturer, the Japanese have as much<br />\npaternal affection as Americans, but<br />\nthat they have also filial affection,<br />\nand consider the rights of the son,<br />\nas well as the rights ,of the parents.<br />\nOn Thursday, Dr. Nitobe illustrated his lecture with lantern slides.<br />\nHe also spoke extemporaneously,<br />\nforsaking his manuscript. He said<br />\nthat Japan is largely mountainous,<br />\nonly about 13 per cent. being under<br />\ncultivation, yet 60 per cent, of the<br />\ninhabitants are engaged in agricultural pursuits.<br />\nThe American popular idea is<br />\nthat the Japanese eat rice as their<br />\nmain article of food. Dr. Nitobe<br />\nstated that this is erroneous. He<br />\nsaid that the poorer people do not<br />\neat rice, because it costs too much.<br />\nThe people who do eat rice always<br />\naccompany such a diet with beans.<br />\nThe Japanese also have an immense<br />\nradish, which forms an important<br />\npart of the food supply.<br />\n\"There are few millionaires in<br />\nJapan,\" he concluded, \"for we are<br />\na poor nation.\"<br /><br />\nThe Medical Standard Book Co.<br />\n307 N.

Would not the publication of the pines of men elected<br />\nto the fraternities seem to confer<br />\na certain sort of distinction upon<br />\nthose men?
