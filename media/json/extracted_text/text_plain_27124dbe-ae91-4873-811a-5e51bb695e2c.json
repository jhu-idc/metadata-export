C.)<br />\n<br />\nA plan to observe April 6, the<br />\nfirst anniversary of America's entry into the war as \"National Win<br />\nthe War Day\" has been worked<br />\nout by the National Committee of<br />\nPatriotic Societies.<br />\nA statement sent out to the<br />\npresidents of fifty National Patriotic Organizations, to, Cabinet<br />\nmembers and other Government<br />\nofficials and to college presidents,<br />\nsays:\"At the beginning of our sec,<br />\nond year in the great war it is fitting that we have a National consecration to the task remaining<br />\nbefore up. Because of numerous<br />\nworkless days during the past winter it is not advisable that the occasion should be made a holiday,<br />\nbut in every factory, store, mine,<br />\nschool and on every farm there<br />\nshould be a brief period during<br />\nthe day where everyone who is<br />\nloyal to the flag should stand up<br />\nand be counted. Flags should<br />\nevery where be unfurled. At 12<br />\no'clock noon factory whistles and<br />\nchurch bells should send forth a<br />\nvolume of sound that will reach<br />\nBerlin. Every band in the country will then play 'The StarSpangled Banner,' while people<br />\nstand at attention. In the evening<br />\nin the churches, halls and. theatres<br />\nthe people-can gather for meetings<br />\nof inspiration. Regiments of the<br />\nNational Army may parade in<br />\ncities 'near the cantonments.<br />\n\"The 'winter of our discontent'<br />\nwith its coalless days and congest<br />\ned railroad and other minor annoyances is past. The spring with<br />\nits promise of abundant crops and<br />\nincreased industrial production is<br />\nhere. Now is the time for America's Home Army to mobilize and<br />\nthus bring courage to our boys in<br />\nthe trenches and cantonments, and<br />\ndepression to our enemies. Let<br />\nGermany feel that this is a popular<br />\nwar in America.

A<br />\n,debate and an oratorical contest<br />\n.cannot be said to be a drawing attraction,even in a'clemocracy where<br />\nthe theoretical basis .of the Government is public discussion and<br />\nin a university _ where mental<br />\ntraining<br />\ntraininfris the fundainental purpose.<br />\nthe Adams contest is<br />\nmote than 'a debate and an oratorical contest it-Is-the one annual occasion in which the rivalry<br />\nof the upper \u2022classmen is revived<br />\nand aired; it is one of the rare occasions when the oldest of the<br />\nlower classes indulge.,in an intellectual celebration as well as when<br />\nthe musical _organizationS present<br />\ntheir fellows with an exhibition<br />\nof real harmony. In other words,<br />\nthe Adams Contest is the one official indoor sport- staged particularly for the Hopkins undergraduate body.<br />\nThe Adams contest is likewise<br />\nunique in the 'Sense that it is the<br />\nonly official occasion upon Which<br />\nHopkins students give a practical<br />\nand public demonstration ,of the<br />\nvalue of their college work. The<br />\ncriticism is often introduced that<br />\ncollege men think well, but usually of themselves, and rarely are<br />\nthey able to intelligently express<br />\nthe products of their thought. A<br />\npublic debate on a living public<br />\nquestion is a satisfactory answer<br />\nto this criticism. But the debate<br />\nin itself is an answer for only a<br />\n<br />\nhandful of men; a large and interested, audience of Hopkins men is<br />\nirrefutable proof of the practical<br />\nvalue of a college education.<br />\nIf the intellectual argument for<br />\nattending the debate does not appeal, the patriotic motive certainly should strike a syrnpathic<br />\nchord. As college-bred men, as<br />\nthinking men, we are expected to<br />\ninterest ourselves (in addition to<br />\nmilitary training) in the great economic and social problem'sgrowing<br />\nout of the war. The subject of the<br />\ndebate is the question of conscription of labor, a war problem of the<br />\nfirst importance. 'How many of<br />\nus now feel that we are in a position, through diligent and scientific study, to express intelligent<br />\nopinions on this problem. You<br />\nowe it to yourself and to your<br />\n'country, to attend an occasional<br />\npublic discussion of these war<br />\nproblerns.<br />\nFinally, if you can muster<br />\nneither an intelligent nor a patriotic interest in the Adams contest, you certainly must as a 114kins man be interested in Hopkins<br />\nevents. A poor attendance at the<br />\ncontest is not so much a slur on<br />\nthe debaters or on the . upper<br />\nclasses as it is on the name of the<br />\nUniversity. The debaterk will derive all the pleasure they ask from<br />\ntheir participation in the debate;<br />\nwe believe that they are much more<br />\ninterested in the subject of the discussion than in the size of the audience. But strangers and visitors<br />\nwill be deeply impressed, favorably or otherwise, by the number<br />\nof students present. The Adams<br />\ncontest is a Hopkins event; every,<br />\nHopkins man, worthy of the name,<br />\nwill support\u2014 even at a personal<br />\nsacrifice otconvenience or perhaps<br />\nof pleasure\u2014this Hopkins event.<br />\n<br />\njust one thing common both to<br />\nthe Barn and to Thrift Stamps\u2014<br />\nnamely, the money - which makes<br />\nthem possible. There is about $800<br />\nworth of the Barn that has not<br />\nyet been paid for. It is an excellent plan, therefore, to buy Thrift<br />\nStamps, and so help pay for the<br />\nexpenses of war; then' to present<br />\nthe Thrift Stamps to the University and so help pay for the privileges you have enjoyed in the<br />\nBarn.

HAMBURGER<br />\n<br />\n[This is the first of a series of articles on Student Council affairs which<br />\nMr. Hamburger has consented to write<br />\nfor THE NEWS-LETTER.]<br />\n<br />\nAt a meeting Of the Board of<br />\nCollegiate Studies the following<br />\nprinciples were laid down with<br />\nregard to the control of absences:<br />\n1. Instructors to record, excuse,<br />\nand report absences (thus doing<br />\naway with the written excuse to<br />\nbe left at the office)..<br />\n2. Absences before and after<br />\nholidays and vacations to be reckoned double and to be excused<br />\nonly_ by the Committee on Academic Rules and Regulations.<br />\n3. When a student of the first<br />\nor second year has in his record<br />\nthree unexcused absences in any<br />\ncourse, he is to be called to the<br />\nDean's office for explanation.<br />\n4.<br />\nof excessive absence,<br />\nexcused or unexcused, are to be<br />\ndealt with by the committee as<br />\nseems best - (this applies' also to<br />\nthird and fourth year men).<br />\nThe following resolution was<br />\npassed by the Student Council in<br />\nconnection with the regulations<br />\nconcerning absences that are<br />\nstated above: \"Be it resolved,<br />\nThat the Student Council endorse the new regulations of the<br />\nfaculty. However, the Student<br />\nCouncil hopes that the faculty will<br />\nhold the plan of allowing men to<br />\nuse their discretion in regard to<br />\nattending classes as an ultimate<br />\nideal towards which the University should strive, because by this<br />\nmethod we believe that the standards and ideals of the undergraduate department will be raised.\"<br />\nThe plan which the Student<br />\nCouncil advocated was that no<br />\nrecord at all be kept og cuts, but<br />\nthat\"\"each man be allowed to use<br />\nhis discretion about going to<br />\nclasses. The_ examinations were to<br />\nbe more comprehensive and failure in three of them would mean<br />\nimmediate expulsion.<br />\nWe believed that we could safely assume that the only men who<br />\nwere at all valuable to Hopkins<br />\nwere those who came to study and<br />\nthat the sooner the rest were gotten rid of, the 'better it would be<br />\nfor all concetned. If a man was<br />\nclever enough to get through his<br />\ncourses without any studying he<br />\nwould be the only loser because<br />\nof the time he wasted at Hopkins.<br />\nIn other words, we wanted to<br />\nraise the Undergraduate Department to the plane of the Graduate<br />\nDepartment, in the hope that men<br />\nfrom all over the country who<br />\nwanted to study would be attracted to Hopkins; and that men who<br />\nwent to college primarily to play<br />\nfootball or lacrosse would choose<br />\nanother college.

Barnett spoke to a meeting of the Amalgamated Clothing<br />\nMakers on Unemployment.<br />\n\"Unemployment,\" Dr. Barnett<br />\nsaid, \"is that condition in which<br />\na man finds himself when he is<br />\nwilling to work, but is unable to<br />\nfind work.\" The evils of unemploymen are fourfold: Unemployment<br />\nis the cause of poverty; it is the<br />\nchief cause of industrial friction;<br />\nit represents a loss of productive<br />\npower, and it stands in the way<br />\nof the solution of other social<br />\nproblems.<br />\nThe extent of unemployment<br />\ncan be learned from a study of the<br />\ndata gathered by the English<br />\ntrade Unions. According to these<br />\nstatistics, at least 2 per cent. of<br />\nthe workers have been out of work<br />\nall the time for the last 30 years;<br />\nthe greatest number out of work<br />\nfor the same period at different<br />\ntimes has been 11 per cent.<br />\nTo attack the evil, two methods<br />\nare possible: Discover the cause<br />\nand eradicate it, or devise a method whereby the evil may be mitigated. There are two kinds of unemployment: First, there is seasonal unemployment, which is the<br />\nmose general. At one time the anthracite coal workers were without jobs from the spring to the<br />\nfall. As no one purchased coaluntil the fall, no one was needed<br />\nto mine the coal until the fall. An<br />\ninvestigation, however, brought to<br />\nlight the fact, that coal was sold<br />\nfor the same price all year round.<br />\nTo induce people to buy in the<br />\nsummer, a reduction in price was<br />\noffered to people who purchased in<br />\nthat season. The anthracite coal<br />\nworkers were soon employed<br />\nthroughout the year. Another way<br />\nto reduce the evil is to make arrangements whereby it will be possible for people to work in different industries at different times<br />\nof the year. The second kind of<br />\nunemployment is that which comes<br />\nwith an industrial depression.<br />\nThe evil resulting from this kind<br />\nof unemployment could be abated<br />\nif the Government should postpone<br />\nsome of its undertakings for such<br />\na period.<br />\nAll this; unfortunately, will not<br />\ndo away with unemployment. The<br />\nbest course for the worker to follow is to insure himself akairist<br />\nunemployment. Compulsory insurance against unemployment<br />\nwas instituted in England in 1912.<br />\nAs an incentive to the worker that<br />\nIle will not ask for an allowance<br />\nunless lie Osolutely needs it, he<br />\nis promised the return of all premiums he has paid, if at the age<br />\nof 60 years, he has received nopayments.

A<br />\n,debate and an oratorical contest<br />\n.cannot be said to be a drawing attraction,even in a'clemocracy where<br />\nthe theoretical basis .of the Government is public discussion and<br />\nin a university _ where mental<br />\ntraining<br />\ntraininfris the fundainental purpose.<br />\nthe Adams contest is<br />\nmote than 'a debate and an oratorical contest it-Is-the one annual occasion in which the rivalry<br />\nof the upper \u2022classmen is revived<br />\nand aired; it is one of the rare occasions when the oldest of the<br />\nlower classes indulge.,in an intellectual celebration as well as when<br />\nthe musical _organizationS present<br />\ntheir fellows with an exhibition<br />\nof real harmony. In other words,<br />\nthe Adams Contest is the one official indoor sport- staged particularly for the Hopkins undergraduate body.<br />\nThe Adams contest is likewise<br />\nunique in the 'Sense that it is the<br />\nonly official occasion upon Which<br />\nHopkins students give a practical<br />\nand public demonstration ,of the<br />\nvalue of their college work. The<br />\ncriticism is often introduced that<br />\ncollege men think well, but usually of themselves, and rarely are<br />\nthey able to intelligently express<br />\nthe products of their thought. A<br />\npublic debate on a living public<br />\nquestion is a satisfactory answer<br />\nto this criticism. But the debate<br />\nin itself is an answer for only a<br /><br />\nhandful of men; a large and interested, audience of Hopkins men is<br />\nirrefutable proof of the practical<br />\nvalue of a college education.<br />\nIf the intellectual argument for<br />\nattending the debate does not appeal, the patriotic motive certainly should strike a syrnpathic<br />\nchord. As college-bred men, as<br />\nthinking men, we are expected to<br />\ninterest ourselves (in addition to<br />\nmilitary training) in the great economic and social problem'sgrowing<br />\nout of the war. The subject of the<br />\ndebate is the question of conscription of labor, a war problem of the<br />\nfirst importance. 'How many of<br />\nus now feel that we are in a position, through diligent and scientific study, to express intelligent<br />\nopinions on this problem. You<br />\nowe it to yourself and to your<br />\n'country, to attend an occasional<br />\npublic discussion of these war<br />\nproblerns.<br />\nFinally, if you can muster<br />\nneither an intelligent nor a patriotic interest in the Adams contest, you certainly must as a 114kins man be interested in Hopkins<br />\nevents. A poor attendance at the<br />\ncontest is not so much a slur on<br />\nthe debaters or on the . upper<br />\nclasses as it is on the name of the<br />\nUniversity. The debaterk will derive all the pleasure they ask from<br />\ntheir participation in the debate;<br />\nwe believe that they are much more<br />\ninterested in the subject of the discussion than in the size of the audience. But strangers and visitors<br />\nwill be deeply impressed, favorably or otherwise, by the number<br />\nof students present. The Adams<br />\ncontest is a Hopkins event; every,<br />\nHopkins man, worthy of the name,<br />\nwill support\u2014 even at a personal<br />\nsacrifice otconvenience or perhaps<br />\nof pleasure\u2014this Hopkins event.<br /><br />\njust one thing common both to<br />\nthe Barn and to Thrift Stamps\u2014<br />\nnamely, the money - which makes<br />\nthem possible. There is about $800<br />\nworth of the Barn that has not<br />\nyet been paid for. It is an excellent plan, therefore, to buy Thrift<br />\nStamps, and so help pay for the<br />\nexpenses of war; then' to present<br />\nthe Thrift Stamps to the University and so help pay for the privileges you have enjoyed in the<br />\nBarn.

HAMBURGER<br /><br />\n[This is the first of a series of articles on Student Council affairs which<br />\nMr. Hamburger has consented to write<br />\nfor THE NEWS-LETTER.]<br /><br />\nAt a meeting Of the Board of<br />\nCollegiate Studies the following<br />\nprinciples were laid down with<br />\nregard to the control of absences:<br />\n1. Instructors to record, excuse,<br />\nand report absences (thus doing<br />\naway with the written excuse to<br />\nbe left at the office)..<br />\n2. Absences before and after<br />\nholidays and vacations to be reckoned double and to be excused<br />\nonly_ by the Committee on Academic Rules and Regulations.<br />\n3. When a student of the first<br />\nor second year has in his record<br />\nthree unexcused absences in any<br />\ncourse, he is to be called to the<br />\nDean's office for explanation.<br />\n4.<br />\nof excessive absence,<br />\nexcused or unexcused, are to be<br />\ndealt with by the committee as<br />\nseems best - (this applies' also to<br />\nthird and fourth year men).<br />\nThe following resolution was<br />\npassed by the Student Council in<br />\nconnection with the regulations<br />\nconcerning absences that are<br />\nstated above: \"Be it resolved,<br />\nThat the Student Council endorse the new regulations of the<br />\nfaculty. However, the Student<br />\nCouncil hopes that the faculty will<br />\nhold the plan of allowing men to<br />\nuse their discretion in regard to<br />\nattending classes as an ultimate<br />\nideal towards which the University should strive, because by this<br />\nmethod we believe that the standards and ideals of the undergraduate department will be raised.\"<br />\nThe plan which the Student<br />\nCouncil advocated was that no<br />\nrecord at all be kept og cuts, but<br />\nthat\"\"each man be allowed to use<br />\nhis discretion about going to<br />\nclasses. The_ examinations were to<br />\nbe more comprehensive and failure in three of them would mean<br />\nimmediate expulsion.<br />\nWe believed that we could safely assume that the only men who<br />\nwere at all valuable to Hopkins<br />\nwere those who came to study and<br />\nthat the sooner the rest were gotten rid of, the 'better it would be<br />\nfor all concetned. If a man was<br />\nclever enough to get through his<br />\ncourses without any studying he<br />\nwould be the only loser because<br />\nof the time he wasted at Hopkins.<br />\nIn other words, we wanted to<br />\nraise the Undergraduate Department to the plane of the Graduate<br />\nDepartment, in the hope that men<br />\nfrom all over the country who<br />\nwanted to study would be attracted to Hopkins; and that men who<br />\nwent to college primarily to play<br />\nfootball or lacrosse would choose<br />\nanother college.

Barnett spoke to a meeting of the Amalgamated Clothing<br />\nMakers on Unemployment.<br />\n\"Unemployment,\" Dr. Barnett<br />\nsaid, \"is that condition in which<br />\na man finds himself when he is<br />\nwilling to work, but is unable to<br />\nfind work.\" The evils of unemploymen are fourfold: Unemployment<br />\nis the cause of poverty; it is the<br />\nchief cause of industrial friction;<br />\nit represents a loss of productive<br />\npower, and it stands in the way<br />\nof the solution of other social<br />\nproblems.<br />\nThe extent of unemployment<br />\ncan be learned from a study of the<br />\ndata gathered by the English<br />\ntrade Unions. According to these<br />\nstatistics, at least 2 per cent. of<br />\nthe workers have been out of work<br />\nall the time for the last 30 years;<br />\nthe greatest number out of work<br />\nfor the same period at different<br />\ntimes has been 11 per cent.<br />\nTo attack the evil, two methods<br />\nare possible: Discover the cause<br />\nand eradicate it, or devise a method whereby the evil may be mitigated. There are two kinds of unemployment: First, there is seasonal unemployment, which is the<br />\nmose general. At one time the anthracite coal workers were without jobs from the spring to the<br />\nfall. As no one purchased coaluntil the fall, no one was needed<br />\nto mine the coal until the fall. An<br />\ninvestigation, however, brought to<br />\nlight the fact, that coal was sold<br />\nfor the same price all year round.<br />\nTo induce people to buy in the<br />\nsummer, a reduction in price was<br />\noffered to people who purchased in<br />\nthat season. The anthracite coal<br />\nworkers were soon employed<br />\nthroughout the year. Another way<br />\nto reduce the evil is to make arrangements whereby it will be possible for people to work in different industries at different times<br />\nof the year. The second kind of<br />\nunemployment is that which comes<br />\nwith an industrial depression.<br />\nThe evil resulting from this kind<br />\nof unemployment could be abated<br />\nif the Government should postpone<br />\nsome of its undertakings for such<br />\na period.<br />\nAll this; unfortunately, will not<br />\ndo away with unemployment. The<br />\nbest course for the worker to follow is to insure himself akairist<br />\nunemployment.
