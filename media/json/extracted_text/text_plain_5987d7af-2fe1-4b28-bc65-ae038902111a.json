To show his gratitude toward the People who had<br />\ncarried him to victory, Carter had promised to open the 48th inauguration to those same<br />\nPeople, the plain, honest folks no different from the Plains fella himself.<br />\nThis inauguration would be a down-to-earth national get-together, a celebration<br />\nconducted in a sort of subdued, proper spirit. No Camelot and flashy socializing, starry<br />\nfigures and heady aspirations; no imperial conduct and closed processions, isolated<br />\nsatisfaction and turbulent moods. At the start of, the country's third century, the<br />\ngovernment would return to and embrace the People, those moderate souls who, confused<br />\nand stranded on the ground, quietly watched the roller coaster of the last fifteen years.<br />\nFor the 1977 inauguration, however, unless one had claim to one of several thousand<br />\nreserved seats in front of the Capitol or had paid $25 for one of 19,000 parade seats, or had<br />\nbeen invited as one of 55,000 guests to one of seven different evening parties\u2014criteria<br />\nwhich seemingly disqualified all but wealthy businessmen, front-line Democrats, media<br />\npersonalities, and Georgia and Minnesota home-state fans\u2014then it was back with the people,<br />\nthe lower-case crowd of a few hundred thousand that huddled and milled about Washington<br />\nin twenty degree discomfort.<br />\nNow the Inaugural Committee had put on the required appearance of keeping the<br />\npromise; they sent out over 300,000 general invitations as a display of opening the event to<br />\nthe People. Ever since the November 2 victory, newspapers had been cluttered with human<br />\ninterest stories of the 71-year-old grandfather who received an invitation in return for his<br />\nten-page single-spaced encouraging letter to Carter way back in February, of the elementary<br />\nschool kid who got invited by merely sending in a request as part of a class project, of the<br />\ncampaign volunteer who had handled ten phone lines through three straight nights. These<br />\npeople, though, would have to scrape together plane fare for their special trip to<br />\nWashington. There, they would find themselves,stuck with an expensive souvenir that didn't<br />\nreserve them any, seats or admit them to any parties. Thus, most of the people who came a<br />\ngreat distance to the capital must have been struck with a patriotic zeal and financial daring.<br />\nOtherwise, they could have simply stayed home and received warm color telecasts of the<br />\nproceedings in their living room, provided by the networks, who already had\u2014and could<br />\nbroadcast from\u2014the best seats available anyway.<br />\nThe People's Inaugural, then, drew a definite distinction between the People who had<br />\nbeen invited to Washington for a four-day stretch of parties and hundreds of dollars in hotel<br />\nand food bills, and the people, a much larger mass that had elected Carter, who had come to<br />\nthe city on Thursday to catch a glimpse of the man they chose as President.<br />\nSomewhat over 200,000 people crowded into D.C. Inauguration Day, the vast majority<br />\nfrom the immediate area, in town via fairly cheap and easy transportation. A Presidential<br />\nInauguration was a big event\u2014like a Super Bowl without the excitement\u2014and happened<br />\nonly once every four years, so why not make a special trip through the cold to see it? After<br />\nall, the inauguration was for the Pesyle, the government would open its doors, things would<br />\ncontinued on page 5<br />\nbe, incredibly enough,free!<br />\n<br />\nWhy didn't the political science courses stimulate him? Was<br />\nnot politics one of his two interests in life, after all? \"You don't<br />\nunderstand. Those courses had nothing to do with recd.politics. I<br />\nwould feel a lot better about those guys (i.e. the poly sci.<br />\nfaculty) if they had once run for county sheriff. Don't drop out,<br />\nmy friends told me. Think of what Marvin Mandel would do in<br />\nyour place. You see, Marvin was my hero. He had come from my<br />\nneighborhood, had been a devotee of the turf while in high<br />\nschool, and had a great sense of humor, too. But he had gone<br />\nthrough college and law school and had managed to keep his<br />\nhedonistic instincts in control until he became governor, that is.<br />\nBut I can't pattern my life after somebody else, even someone as<br />\nadmirable as Marvin. I guess I have a low toleration for boredom.<br />\nI can't play the establishment's game any more, so I have to<br />\nchallenge its unwritten laws: \"You can't be a politician unless<br />\nyou're a lawyer.

I'm<br />\nheading for the governor's mansion, and I'm going to do it my<br />\nway, tearing up the script society tried to impose upon me and<br />\nwriting my own script. I'll just play it by ear.

ZELINSKY<br />\nAn unexpected year-end drain<br />\non work study funds has stopped<br />\nfurther enrollment in the<br />\nprogram for the coming semester.<br />\nIn a letter sent to all<br />\nsupervisors and student<br />\nParticipants, the Office of<br />\nFinancial Aid also announced a<br />\nfreeze on pay raises, and a fifteen<br />\nhour per week ceiling on<br />\nwork-study employment.<br />\nDirector of Academic Services,<br />\nLarry Denton, explained the<br />\nsituation \"was not atypical\" and<br />\nthat \"natural attrition\" during<br />\nthe second semester has enabled<br />\nthe program to stay within its<br />\nbudgetary limits in past years.<br />\nDenton indicated a similar<br />\nsituation developed last year, but<br />\na windfall of federal funds helped<br />\nresolve the problem.<br />\nWork-study, a program<br />\nPopular with \"students, faculty<br />\nmembers and legislators\", is \"an<br />\nadministrative nightmare'',<br />\naccording to Financial Aid<br />\n<br />\nOfficer, Caroline Wahle. 'It is<br />\nimpossible to accurately<br />\nadminister because the number<br />\nof hours worked is left to the<br />\nstudent's disrretion<br />\n/I<br />\n<br />\nLarry Denton<br />\n<br />\nWahle blamed the current<br />\ndilemma on the lack of efficient<br />\nmechanisms for monitoring the<br />\nprogram. She explained tha(as a<br />\nresult of aggressive fund<br />\nprocurement the program ha5.<br />\ngrown from 1 0 0 to<br />\n<br />\napproximately 500 participants<br />\nover the past four years. in<br />\nSeptember, students were able to<br />\nchoose from the largest number<br />\nof jobs ever offered under the<br />\nwork-study program at Hopkins.<br />\nThe program was also extended<br />\nto other Hopkins divisions<br />\n(including the Medical School<br />\nand the School of Hygiene and<br />\nPublic Health). Also, professors<br />\nand job supervisors are<br />\nempowered to reward students<br />\ngood performances with raises,<br />\nwhich further serves to<br />\ncomplicate the program's<br />\nadministration. The combination<br />\nof these factors with an<br />\nunexpected surge in the number<br />\nof hours worked by students at<br />\nthe end of the last semester,<br />\nresulted in a rapid siphoning off<br />\nof available work-study funds.<br />\n\"Had we gone on at the same<br />\nrate, we would have run out of<br />\nwork-study monies by about<br />\nMarch 15 and the new fiscal year<br />\ndoesn't begin until the first of<br />\n<br />\nStudents get shafted again,<br />\n_ By MARK HERTSGAARD<br />\n\"My God,are we getting shafted!\"<br />\nWhat student who has heard about the<br />\nadministration's new calendar plan would<br />\n.7hristmas! Are you kidding?<br />\ndisagree? Exams after(<br />\nAnd the amount of student input to the decision<br />\nhas truly been a tribute to the concept of<br />\ncooperative decision making. After all, the notion<br />\nof a calendar change was casually mentioned to<br />\nstudent leaders two or three years ago. I mean<br />\nreally, what more should we expect? We're not<br />\nnaive enough to believe that students have any real<br />\nPower over university decisions, are we'?<br />\nThe new calendar proposal is a good example of<br />\nhow decisions are made at this university.<br />\nAdministration and/or faculty determine an<br />\nobjective, outline a plan to achieve it, and finally<br />\nmove to implement it. Students are usually<br />\nbypassed in this process. Yet it is not quite<br />\naccurate to say that students are hot represented<br />\nat all. We are able to voice our opinions during-the<br />\nformation of some decisions, such as the selection<br />\nof a new housing director, the MSE symposium,<br />\nthe Spring Fair, and so on. But in looking at the<br />\ninfluence of student opinion on the various<br />\ndecisions within the university, a pattern begins to<br />\nemerge: the more fundamental a decision, the less<br />\nProbability there is that students will have much<br />\nto say about it. These kinds of decision are seen<br />\nas too important to be left to students.<br />\nIt would be wrong to say that students are<br />\ntotally without influence over some policies at<br />\nHopkins. But the influence is often only,a measly<br />\namount and has the effect of buying us 'off from<br />\nthe more equal participation in the daily running<br />\nof the university which we deserve. The calendar<br />\nissue is a case in point. The basic message coming<br />\nfrom the Muller administration is, \"you can<br />\nsquawk, but no matter what, there will be a<br />\ncalendar change and it will be what we have<br />\nproposed.\" Students and other segments of the<br />\nuniversity population will be able to make<br />\n\"comments and suggestions\" on the plan, but on<br />\nApril 1 some version of the plan will be chosen.<br />\nYou can bet, too, that the essential aspects of the<br />\nPlan will remain.<br />\nJust consider for a moment how conveniently<br />\nthe administration has developed this plan. After<br />\ndeciding they wanted a calendar change , a<br />\nproposal was developed and later announct.c1 with<br />\nthe implication that, regardless of opposition, a<br />\ncalendar change would be made. This was a strong<br />\nmove because it let the administration determine<br />\nthe \"rules of the game,\" when the inevitable<br />\narguments against the proposal surfaced.<br />\nAlthough it was advantageous for the<br />\nadministration not to solicit other opinions before<br />\n<br />\nthe announcement, a change as big as this one<br />\ncould not simply be executed by executive fiat.<br />\nToo many people are opposed and -unless their<br />\ndisagreements are dealt with, it will make for<br />\nproblems later. There must at least be the<br />\nappearance that the complaints are being heard.<br />\nThe polite and formal solicitation of discussion<br />\nabout the proposal and suggestions for its,<br />\nimprovement results. There will be committees<br />\nand alternatives proposed. But in the end,.if all<br />\ngoes according to plan, the proposal will go into<br />\neffect unscathed.<br />\nIf students protest this decision only within the<br />\nexisting, normal channels, we will have a hard time<br />\ngaining any ground. While the administration gives<br />\nthe impression that alternatives may be pursued<br />\nthrough rational discussion until April 1, the<br />\nprobability of change is actually quite small. The<br />\ngame is not so equal as they would have us believe.<br />\nThe parts of the plan to which students are most<br />\nseriously opposed are the very ones upon which<br />\nthe administration has refused to compromise!<br />\nAnd they have a trump card; if no alternatives are<br />\nagreed upon by April 1, the administration will<br />\nforce itself to implement its own proposal.<br />\nThey will still be able to claim that they had<br />\nlistened to everyone. They'll say we had an<br />\nopportunity to help shape the final decision, but<br />\nwe failed to take advantage of it. At best their<br />\nactions are less than honest. At worst, the<br />\nadministration is guilty of using conniving,<br />\nbullying methods in order to force its proposal<br />\ndown the unwilling thoat of a Hopkins population<br />\nwho \"can't come up with anything better.\"<br />\nWhat is particularly galling about the whole<br />\naffair is their methods. We won't die from exams<br />\nafter Christmas. These hassles, along with annual<br />\ntuition hikes and other obvious problems, are only<br />\nsymptons of a deeper problem, which, until we<br />\nstudents perceive and correct, will not stop<br />\nplaguing us.<br />\nWe students must demand a greater voice in the<br />\naffairs of Johns Hopkins. We must not be content<br />\nwith the bottom rung of the power ladder. We are<br />\nas important as anyone else in this university, and<br />\nnot just because our $3500 per year helps foot<br />\nmuch of the bill. But because what university can<br />\nexist without students? We are the llifeblood of<br />\nthis place; we can make things stop and we can<br />\nmake things go. Until now we've usually been<br />\ncontent to let things slide and we can see where<br />\nthat has gotten us.<br />\nBut it's not too late to speak up. Students can<br />\nexert an important influence on the university, but<br />\nit won't be given to us just for the asking. But it<br />\nwould be worthwhile.

His first Presidential act, the pardon<br />\nof Vietnam draft evaders, dissatisfied quite a few people on<br />\nboth the right and left. The semantics of \"pardon\" and<br />\n\"amnesty\" can be debated, and the whole question of<br />\ndeserters has been neglected, but at least Carter has<br />\ndemonstrated a willingness to take some action (in his first<br />\nweek, yet), inconclusive and compromised as it may be.<br />\nWe hope a Carter presidency will act as swiftly on the<br />\nmatter of \"our ultimate goal -- the elimination of all nuclear<br />\nweapons from this earth.\" Granted, an inaugural address<br />\ndoes not add up to much more than _twenty pages of<br />\nhistory-tinged rhetoric and familiar ideals, but Carter has<br />\nthe chance to act decisively in the next few months. His<br />\ncampaign promises of cancelling the B-1 bomber program<br />\nand cutting five to seven billion dollars from the defense<br />\nbudget can be carried through; whether Carter has the<br />\ndesire to cross the Pentagon brass and powerful pro-military<br />\ncongressmen remains to be seen.<br />\nJames Dickey's Inaugural poem closed with the lines \"I<br />\nwill do what I can.\" Jimmy Carter, the outsider in town,<br />\nhas a great opportunity to shake up the Washington<br />\nestablishment.<br />\n<br />\n'By STEVE SCHULTZ<br />\nFor a nation that poses as one<br />\never looking to the future, the<br />\nCarter \"pardon\" is a fundamental<br />\nmistake if we are to learn from<br />\nthe past. Carter's intent is to<br />\n\"close the book\" on the Vietnam<br />\ndebacle and to portray American<br />\nforeign policy as a \"mistake.\"<br />\nThe \"carterization\" of the<br />\nSoutheast Asian war, under the<br />\nguise of rhetoric proclaiming a<br />\n\"new\" unity and spirit,<br />\nrepresents nothing less than a<br />\nre-writing of history. To deny all<br />\nmemory of the war is to prevent<br />\nan understanding of the conflict.<br />\nIt is aimed at aborting a national<br />\nexamination of the nature of the<br />\nwar in which over 56,000<br />\nAmerican boys were killed, over<br />\n300,000 GIs were wounded, and<br />\nmillions of Vietnamese,<br />\nCambodians, and Laotians were<br />\nkilled, maimed, and made<br />\nhomeless.<br />\n<br />\na whole during the '60s and early<br />\n70s suffered countless<br />\ndocumented as well as<br />\nundocumented acts of sabatoge<br />\nfrom intelligence agencies who<br />\nbelieved it their job to monitor<br />\nand regulate the thought<br />\nprocesses for American citizens.<br />\nCarter, in the midst of the<br />\ncampaign, labelled the Vietnam<br />\nWar as \"racist\" yet he has issued<br />\na proclamation that is implicitly<br />\nrace-biased, class-based, and<br />\npunitive in regard to those<br />\nexcluded. An historian of the<br />\nmilitary during the Vietnam War<br />\nhas stated: \"Military deserters<br />\nhave done the same as draft<br />\nresisters in refusing to participate<br />\nin the military, except that they<br />\n<br />\nUniversal<br />\nIn pursuing the more<br />\n\"moderate\" course, Carter<br />\nlimited his pardon to the smallest<br />\nconstituency of Vietnam-era war<br />\nresisters that needed universal<br />\nand unconditional anmesty. His<br />\nproclamation pertains only , to<br />\ndraft evaders\u2014those who refused<br />\nto register as well as those who<br />\nchose foreign exile. According to<br />\nJustice Department figures, the<br />\nlatter category approximates<br />\n10,000.<br />\nDuring the campaign for the<br />\nDemocratic Presidential<br />\nnomination, candidate Jimmy<br />\nCarter stated: \"I don't have the<br />\ndesire- to punish anyone.\"<br />\nPresident Carter has excluded<br />\nfrom his pardon some 790,000<br />\nVietnam veterans with<br />\nless-than-honorable discharges<br />\nand approximately 40,000<br />\ndeserters-at-large. This will<br />\nprobably not be the last time<br />\nthat there exists a gap between<br />\nrhetoric and reality (look at his<br />\neconomic proposals, for<br />\nexample.)<br />\nAlso neglected under the<br />\nCarter pardon are tens of<br />\nthousands of civilian resisters<br />\nwith \"criminal records\" or still<br />\nimprisoned. The latter were often<br />\nillegally arrested, viciously<br />\nharrassed, convicted, and<br />\nimprisoned for their opposition<br />\nto the war. Scores of Americans<br />\nwere subject to frame-ups in<br />\npolitical trials for their anti-war<br />\nactivism. The peace movement as<br />\n<br />\nMARGULIES<br />\nElla<br />\n<br />\nslick<br />\nWe saw something funny the other day. There was an<br />\ninspired bit of slapstick as some poor student tried to cross<br />\n34th Street between McCoy and Wohnan Halls. He was<br />\ncarrying two bags of groceries and could -hardly see where<br />\nhe was going. It was hilarious as we watched the guy step<br />\noff the curb and begin slipping and sliding on the ice that<br />\nhad replaced lthe pavement. He held his balance for a few<br />\nseconds, then whoops! he fell. We thought we'd bust a gut<br />\nas we saw oranges and cans roll down the street.

Most of these<br />\nprivileged resisters faced the draft<br />\nin their mid-twenties.<br />\nPoorer people,<br />\n<br />\ndisproportionately from black<br />\nand other minority groups as well<br />\nas working-class whites, faced the<br />\ndraft at eighteen. Having but<br />\nlimited exposure to anti-war<br />\nsentiment and counseling, they<br />\nlearned about the war firsthand,<br />\nafter induction. As a result, they<br />\nresisted from within the<br />\nAmerican military machine.<br />\nMany deserted but many more<br />\nsuffered less-than- honorable<br />\ndischarges, a guaranteed ticket to<br />\nthe unemployment line.<br />\nOver 9 0 % of the<br />\nless-than-honorable discharges are<br />\nissued administratively without<br />\nany due process for \"offenses\"<br />\nthat have no parallel in civilian<br />\nlaw. They served the purpose of<br />\nrepressing anti-war activity and<br />\npunishing \"malcontents.\" The<br />\nendemic racism of the military is<br />\nreflected in the fact that most of<br />\nthese discharges were given to<br />\nminority peoples.<br />\nWhile the civilian anti-war<br />\nmovement .(and not \"liberal\"<br />\npoliticians) Splayed a major role in<br />\nour withdrawal from Southeast<br />\nAsia, little is known about the<br />\nresistance within the military. A<br />\nspontaneous rejection of the war<br />\nwas one of the most<br />\ncharacteristic features of GI<br />\nopposition. Demonstrations on<br />\nmilitary bases, GI newspapers,<br />\nactivist coffeehouses, and<br />\nend-the-war petitions all stand as<br />\ncourageous acts of resistance on<br />\nthe part of men in uniform. At<br />\nfirst, there were literally<br />\nhundreds of incidents involving<br />\nindividual soldiers, and, later,<br />\nentire units who refused combat<br />\norders in Vietnam.<br />\nCarter's pardons continue to<br />\naggravate, rather than alleviate,<br />\npostwar wounds. The U.S.<br />\ngovernment has continually acted<br />\nto pit groups of war victims<br />\nagainst each other: those who<br />\nfought, believing its lies, those<br />\nwho chose to resist, MIA (missing<br />\nin action) families, POWs, etc.<br />\nNow Carter is pitting the draft<br />\nevader against the lower-income<br />\npost-induction war resister.<br />\nDivisiveness, rather than<br />\nconcord, will remain untill.a total<br />\nand unconditional amnesty is<br />\ngranted for all draft resisters.<br />\nSuch an amnesty will not only<br />\nrestore the rights of Americans<br />\nwho opposed the war but would.<br />\nhopefully, educate and inform all<br />\nAmericans of the character of<br />\nAmerican intervention for more<br />\nthan a decade.<br />\n<br />\n-s<br />\niso<br />\n-lI\u2014 ar<br />\nVOMISES<br />\nNOW PLAYING<br />\n<br />\n\u2022 lkia<br />\n<br />\nIlls NMI<br />\n11111Pula<br />\nIBM<br />\n<br />\n0111111111.<br />\n<br />\nGONE<br />\nWITH<br />\nTHE<br />\nWIND<br />\n<br />\nNMI<br />\nimUngiVismilmaiiniaraiesisommi<br />\n<br />\nLTr<br />\n<br />\ndr_ 1<br />\ngia<br />\nmum<br />\nss<br />\ndBillialb<br />\n1=11111111<br />\n1111111.1<br />\n11111illimiliiiii<br />\nMai<br />\nMaim<br />\ngewm\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022<br />\n11111111111.111111<br />\nWanimpari<br />\nINNIIIMM<br />\nIDA.1111enom<br />\n1011110110111im<br />\n1.110111011111111.1 dIIIIIIHIBM=iillelliONSIP<br />\nuj<br />\nmain<br />\n<br />\n\fJimmy walks among plain folk,<br />\nbrings along the peanut omelette<br />\ncontinued from cover<br />\nSo fifteen people climbed<br />\naboard a Greyhound Inaugural<br />\nBus special Thursday morning<br />\nwith the only special feature a<br />\nterminal point near the Capitol,<br />\nrather than at the far-off station<br />\non 14th Street. Anticipating the<br />\nhistory ahead, most riders<br />\nbrought along $20 Kodak<br />\nInstamatics, which in two weeks'<br />\ntime would provide them with<br />\nthirty-six blurry photos of backs<br />\nof heads and distant black suits<br />\nto show proudly to their<br />\ngrandchildren. A few retired<br />\ncouples, father-son and<br />\nmother-daughter pairs, students,<br />\nand some solo travellers filled ,<br />\nhalf the bus seats; obviously,/<br />\nreservations weren't necessary for<br />\nthe people to get into<br />\nWashington.<br />\nOne short, stocky businessman<br />\nserved notice of the dark side of<br />\ntouring the city. Wearing a tweed<br />\nsuit and tan hat with a duck<br />\nfeather in the hat band, he<br />\nPuffed and grunted his advice to<br />\n<br />\nConstitution Avenues with<br />\nCapitol Street at the base.<br />\nMoving in from all directions,<br />\nthey sent the scores of city cops<br />\ninto a dutiful frenzy of<br />\nwhistle- blowing<br />\nand<br />\nhand-signalling.<br />\nTo cross the bordering streets<br />\nand actually get on Capitol<br />\ngrounds, one needed a ticket of<br />\nsome sort. Certain People carried<br />\nblue tickets and gained quick<br />\nentrance; many others had yellow passes and seemed to flow<br />\naround the grounds perimeter<br />\nuntil they reached an uncrowded<br />\nsection to shove through. In<br />\nsome spots, hundreds of people<br />\njoined together, clamoring for<br />\nadmission, and a few beleaguered<br />\nguards shouted and tried to<br />\nmaintain order. The policemen<br />\nwould call for \"only those with<br />\nyellow tickets!\", and a sea of<br />\nhands would wave yellow cards<br />\nin the air, giving off a loud cheer<br />\nlike a football crowd. Some<br />\nnon-ticket holders mingled with<br />\nthe rest managed to edge in<br />\n<br />\nal.)<br />\n, who would listen. \"You'd<br />\nbetter watch out when you get<br />\noff,\" he warned.\"Those bastards<br />\nwill pick your pockets clean.<br />\nThey work in groups\u2014one of<br />\nthem bumps into you,smoking a<br />\nCigarette, another reaches right<br />\ninto your coat or pants and grabs<br />\nYour wallet. I'm not kidding<br />\nYou!\"<br />\nThe duck hat businessman<br />\nturned out to be right. Three<br />\nPickpockets were arrested that<br />\nday, the most prevalent crime<br />\nout of a total of seven minor<br />\noffenses. In the sole accident of<br />\nthe Inauguration, a woman fell<br />\nfrom her horse during the parade<br />\nand suffered slight bruises.<br />\nPickpockets and unlicensed<br />\nvendors\u2014hardly the threat of<br />\nviolence in the streets that<br />\nbrought out the Guard four years<br />\nago. For the People's Inaugural,<br />\nthe only employment the<br />\nmilitary got was to take<br />\njackhammers and flame throwers<br />\nto the heavy ice on the main<br />\nroads.<br />\nAs the day moved closer to the<br />\nnoon swearing-in time, the<br />\nPeople began to mass around the<br />\nCapitol area. Early arrivals had<br />\nsecured the highest stair points<br />\non the buildings surrounding the<br />\nCapitol; their hours of waiting<br />\nmade them placid frozen<br />\nCompanions to the marble<br />\ngargoyles. The crowds pushed<br />\ninto the small rectangle bounded<br />\nby Independence and<br />\n<br />\nunnoticea, the majority,however,<br />\nwere warded off by a string of<br />\nparatroopers stationed at<br />\ntwo-foot intervals around the<br />\nCapitol. The paratroopers, with<br />\ntheir funny purple felt caps and<br />\nheavy black boots, stood firmly<br />\nwith their backs to the crowd,<br />\nready for any orders from the<br />\ncommand tent.<br />\nMeanwhile, the ticketless had<br />\nbegun to realize that the yellow<br />\npasses weren't worth too much.<br />\nThe passes, it turned out, had<br />\nbeen freely handed out by<br />\ncongressmen to anyone claiming<br />\nto be a constituent. One had only<br />\nto go to a nearby office building<br />\nand hit up the first representative<br />\nfor a fistful of yellow tickets.<br />\nThus the large crowd of yellow<br />\nticket holders, once granted<br />\naccess to the Capitol lawn, would<br />\nmove liberated toward the<br />\nswearing-in platform, only to<br />\nfind themselves roped off a good<br />\ndistance behind the reserved<br />\nseating area. The few \u2022 thousand<br />\ngrey fold-up plastic chairs,<br />\nincidentally, were the same seats<br />\nused for the Moon \"God Bless<br />\nAmerica\" Festival four months<br />\nbefore; the National Park Service<br />\nplays no favorites.<br />\nExcept for the people in the<br />\nfront lines on the Capitol<br />\ngrounds, then, yellow-ticket<br />\nholders and plain spectators were<br />\nequal\u2014they shared obstructed<br />\nviews and muffled speeches. In<br />\nfact, for those at the far end of<br />\n<br />\nthe area, along the Library of<br />\nCongress and Supreme Court, the<br />\nvoice of the speakers came first<br />\nover a hand-held transistor radio,<br />\nand then a second or two later<br />\nover the amplification system.<br />\nThis technical phenomenon<br />\nlulled the exuberance of the<br />\nceremony: Jimmy Carter took<br />\nthe oath of office, his words<br />\ncrackling on the radio, to be<br />\nfollowed by the \"live\" sound at<br />\nthe \"instant\" of the swearing-in.<br />\nThe people had come to be<br />\nactual witnesses to this historic<br />\noccasion, accepting a good<br />\ndistance away and the principals<br />\nout of sight, and now they found<br />\nthemselves oddly cheated out of<br />\ntheir personal connection,<br />\nthwarted by some impersonal<br />\nelectronic quirk.<br />\nDuring Carter's inaugural<br />\naddress, the crowd cheered about<br />\na half-dozen times, a reserved<br />\napplause that would spread<br />\noutward as those up close<br />\nclapped first and provided a cue.<br />\nThe speech carried fairly well<br />\n<br />\nover the many outdoor speakers,<br />\nbut it required strict<br />\nconcentration to follow every<br />\nword, and every word seemed<br />\njust like the preceding one, a<br />\ngeneral term expressing hope and<br />\ndreams and faith and other<br />\ntrusted cliches. Under those<br />\nconditions, the crowd did not<br />\npay rapt attentiont throughout<br />\nthe ,sixteen -minute speech and<br />\nrelated songs and statements;<br />\n<br />\nmany of those yellow-ticket<br />\nholders formed a steady file<br />\nstreaming out of the gates in the<br />\nmidst of the address. The people<br />\nwent off in hope of a better<br />\nvantage point for the parade, or<br />\nto get something to eat, or to<br />\nperhaps catch an early bus home<br />\nalready.<br />\nWith such a large number of<br />\npeople about, the street vendors<br />\nand souvenir hucksters came in<br />\nforce to Washington. Many<br />\npeople sported green Carter ski<br />\ncaps and T-shirts, wore buttons<br />\nof all description and rattled<br />\npeanut , key chains and necklaces,<br />\nwaved Carter pennants and<br />\ncollected 3-D Carter postcards.<br />\nThey might not have been able to<br />\nexperience the Inauguration, but<br />\nthey certainly could buy a little<br />\npart of it, a bit of memorabilia to<br />\ngo with the out-of-focus<br />\nphotographs.<br />\nThere was also a government<br />\nvan parked on the corner of First<br />\nand Capitol, advertising \"Free<br />\nImmunization\" in bright red<br />\nletters. The Swine Flu Bus failed<br />\nto draw any shot-takers, alkind<br />\nof empty postscript to the<br />\noutgoing presidency. After the<br />\nswearing-in, the Ford helicopter<br />\nhovered over the Capitol and<br />\nthen sped off, leaving behind the<br />\nunvisited immunization van and<br />\nthe rest of the capital.<br />\nDown the southeast end of<br />\n' Pennsylvania Avenue, the local<br />\ncafes and restaurants were doing<br />\nbrisk business, packed with<br />\ncustomer tryin the seanut<br />\n<br />\nomelette aud hominy grits.

To show his gratitude toward the People who had<br />\ncarried him to victory, Carter had promised to open the 48th inauguration to those same<br />\nPeople, the plain, honest folks no different from the Plains fella himself.<br />\nThis inauguration would be a down-to-earth national get-together, a celebration<br />\nconducted in a sort of subdued, proper spirit. No Camelot and flashy socializing, starry<br />\nfigures and heady aspirations; no imperial conduct and closed processions, isolated<br />\nsatisfaction and turbulent moods. At the start of, the country's third century, the<br />\ngovernment would return to and embrace the People, those moderate souls who, confused<br />\nand stranded on the ground, quietly watched the roller coaster of the last fifteen years.<br />\nFor the 1977 inauguration, however, unless one had claim to one of several thousand<br />\nreserved seats in front of the Capitol or had paid $25 for one of 19,000 parade seats, or had<br />\nbeen invited as one of 55,000 guests to one of seven different evening parties\u2014criteria<br />\nwhich seemingly disqualified all but wealthy businessmen, front-line Democrats, media<br />\npersonalities, and Georgia and Minnesota home-state fans\u2014then it was back with the people,<br />\nthe lower-case crowd of a few hundred thousand that huddled and milled about Washington<br />\nin twenty degree discomfort.<br />\nNow the Inaugural Committee had put on the required appearance of keeping the<br />\npromise; they sent out over 300,000 general invitations as a display of opening the event to<br />\nthe People. Ever since the November 2 victory, newspapers had been cluttered with human<br />\ninterest stories of the 71-year-old grandfather who received an invitation in return for his<br />\nten-page single-spaced encouraging letter to Carter way back in February, of the elementary<br />\nschool kid who got invited by merely sending in a request as part of a class project, of the<br />\ncampaign volunteer who had handled ten phone lines through three straight nights. These<br />\npeople, though, would have to scrape together plane fare for their special trip to<br />\nWashington. There, they would find themselves,stuck with an expensive souvenir that didn't<br />\nreserve them any, seats or admit them to any parties. Thus, most of the people who came a<br />\ngreat distance to the capital must have been struck with a patriotic zeal and financial daring.<br />\nOtherwise, they could have simply stayed home and received warm color telecasts of the<br />\nproceedings in their living room, provided by the networks, who already had\u2014and could<br />\nbroadcast from\u2014the best seats available anyway.<br />\nThe People's Inaugural, then, drew a definite distinction between the People who had<br />\nbeen invited to Washington for a four-day stretch of parties and hundreds of dollars in hotel<br />\nand food bills, and the people, a much larger mass that had elected Carter, who had come to<br />\nthe city on Thursday to catch a glimpse of the man they chose as President.<br />\nSomewhat over 200,000 people crowded into D.C. Inauguration Day, the vast majority<br />\nfrom the immediate area, in town via fairly cheap and easy transportation. A Presidential<br />\nInauguration was a big event\u2014like a Super Bowl without the excitement\u2014and happened<br />\nonly once every four years, so why not make a special trip through the cold to see it?

ZELINSKY<br />\nAn unexpected year-end drain<br />\non work study funds has stopped<br />\nfurther enrollment in the<br />\nprogram for the coming semester.<br />\nIn a letter sent to all<br />\nsupervisors and student<br />\nParticipants, the Office of<br />\nFinancial Aid also announced a<br />\nfreeze on pay raises, and a fifteen<br />\nhour per week ceiling on<br />\nwork-study employment.<br />\nDirector of Academic Services,<br />\nLarry Denton, explained the<br />\nsituation \"was not atypical\" and<br />\nthat \"natural attrition\" during<br />\nthe second semester has enabled<br />\nthe program to stay within its<br />\nbudgetary limits in past years.<br />\nDenton indicated a similar<br />\nsituation developed last year, but<br />\na windfall of federal funds helped<br />\nresolve the problem.<br />\nWork-study, a program<br />\nPopular with \"students, faculty<br />\nmembers and legislators\", is \"an<br />\nadministrative nightmare'',<br />\naccording to Financial Aid<br /><br />\nOfficer, Caroline Wahle. 'It is<br />\nimpossible to accurately<br />\nadminister because the number<br />\nof hours worked is left to the<br />\nstudent's disrretion<br />\n/I<br /><br />\nLarry Denton<br /><br />\nWahle blamed the current<br />\ndilemma on the lack of efficient<br />\nmechanisms for monitoring the<br />\nprogram. She explained tha(as a<br />\nresult of aggressive fund<br />\nprocurement the program ha5.<br />\ngrown from 1 0 0 to<br /><br />\napproximately 500 participants<br />\nover the past four years. in<br />\nSeptember, students were able to<br />\nchoose from the largest number<br />\nof jobs ever offered under the<br />\nwork-study program at Hopkins.<br />\nThe program was also extended<br />\nto other Hopkins divisions<br />\n(including the Medical School<br />\nand the School of Hygiene and<br />\nPublic Health). Also, professors<br />\nand job supervisors are<br />\nempowered to reward students<br />\ngood performances with raises,<br />\nwhich further serves to<br />\ncomplicate the program's<br />\nadministration. The combination<br />\nof these factors with an<br />\nunexpected surge in the number<br />\nof hours worked by students at<br />\nthe end of the last semester,<br />\nresulted in a rapid siphoning off<br />\nof available work-study funds.<br />\n\"Had we gone on at the same<br />\nrate, we would have run out of<br />\nwork-study monies by about<br />\nMarch 15 and the new fiscal year<br />\ndoesn't begin until the first of<br /><br />\nStudents get shafted again,<br />\n_ By MARK HERTSGAARD<br />\n\"My God,are we getting shafted!\"<br />\nWhat student who has heard about the<br />\nadministration's new calendar plan would<br />\n.7hristmas! Are you kidding?<br />\ndisagree? Exams after(<br />\nAnd the amount of student input to the decision<br />\nhas truly been a tribute to the concept of<br />\ncooperative decision making. After all, the notion<br />\nof a calendar change was casually mentioned to<br />\nstudent leaders two or three years ago. I mean<br />\nreally, what more should we expect? We're not<br />\nnaive enough to believe that students have any real<br />\nPower over university decisions, are we'?<br />\nThe new calendar proposal is a good example of<br />\nhow decisions are made at this university.<br />\nAdministration and/or faculty determine an<br />\nobjective, outline a plan to achieve it, and finally<br />\nmove to implement it. Students are usually<br />\nbypassed in this process. Yet it is not quite<br />\naccurate to say that students are hot represented<br />\nat all. We are able to voice our opinions during-the<br />\nformation of some decisions, such as the selection<br />\nof a new housing director, the MSE symposium,<br />\nthe Spring Fair, and so on. But in looking at the<br />\ninfluence of student opinion on the various<br />\ndecisions within the university, a pattern begins to<br />\nemerge: the more fundamental a decision, the less<br />\nProbability there is that students will have much<br />\nto say about it. These kinds of decision are seen<br />\nas too important to be left to students.<br />\nIt would be wrong to say that students are<br />\ntotally without influence over some policies at<br />\nHopkins. But the influence is often only,a measly<br />\namount and has the effect of buying us 'off from<br />\nthe more equal participation in the daily running<br />\nof the university which we deserve. The calendar<br />\nissue is a case in point. The basic message coming<br />\nfrom the Muller administration is, \"you can<br />\nsquawk, but no matter what, there will be a<br />\ncalendar change and it will be what we have<br />\nproposed.\" Students and other segments of the<br />\nuniversity population will be able to make<br />\n\"comments and suggestions\" on the plan, but on<br />\nApril 1 some version of the plan will be chosen.<br />\nYou can bet, too, that the essential aspects of the<br />\nPlan will remain.<br />\nJust consider for a moment how conveniently<br />\nthe administration has developed this plan. After<br />\ndeciding they wanted a calendar change , a<br />\nproposal was developed and later announct.c1 with<br />\nthe implication that, regardless of opposition, a<br />\ncalendar change would be made. This was a strong<br />\nmove because it let the administration determine<br />\nthe \"rules of the game,\" when the inevitable<br />\narguments against the proposal surfaced.<br />\nAlthough it was advantageous for the<br />\nadministration not to solicit other opinions before<br /><br />\nthe announcement, a change as big as this one<br />\ncould not simply be executed by executive fiat.<br />\nToo many people are opposed and -unless their<br />\ndisagreements are dealt with, it will make for<br />\nproblems later. There must at least be the<br />\nappearance that the complaints are being heard.<br />\nThe polite and formal solicitation of discussion<br />\nabout the proposal and suggestions for its,<br />\nimprovement results. There will be committees<br />\nand alternatives proposed. But in the end,.if all<br />\ngoes according to plan, the proposal will go into<br />\neffect unscathed.<br />\nIf students protest this decision only within the<br />\nexisting, normal channels, we will have a hard time<br />\ngaining any ground. While the administration gives<br />\nthe impression that alternatives may be pursued<br />\nthrough rational discussion until April 1, the<br />\nprobability of change is actually quite small. The<br />\ngame is not so equal as they would have us believe.<br />\nThe parts of the plan to which students are most<br />\nseriously opposed are the very ones upon which<br />\nthe administration has refused to compromise!<br />\nAnd they have a trump card; if no alternatives are<br />\nagreed upon by April 1, the administration will<br />\nforce itself to implement its own proposal.<br />\nThey will still be able to claim that they had<br />\nlistened to everyone. They'll say we had an<br />\nopportunity to help shape the final decision, but<br />\nwe failed to take advantage of it. At best their<br />\nactions are less than honest. At worst, the<br />\nadministration is guilty of using conniving,<br />\nbullying methods in order to force its proposal<br />\ndown the unwilling thoat of a Hopkins population<br />\nwho \"can't come up with anything better.\"<br />\nWhat is particularly galling about the whole<br />\naffair is their methods. We won't die from exams<br />\nafter Christmas. These hassles, along with annual<br />\ntuition hikes and other obvious problems, are only<br />\nsymptons of a deeper problem, which, until we<br />\nstudents perceive and correct, will not stop<br />\nplaguing us.<br />\nWe students must demand a greater voice in the<br />\naffairs of Johns Hopkins. We must not be content<br />\nwith the bottom rung of the power ladder. We are<br />\nas important as anyone else in this university, and<br />\nnot just because our $3500 per year helps foot<br />\nmuch of the bill.

Until now we've usually been<br />\ncontent to let things slide and we can see where<br />\nthat has gotten us.<br />\nBut it's not too late to speak up. Students can<br />\nexert an important influence on the university, but<br />\nit won't be given to us just for the asking. But it<br />\nwould be worthwhile.

His first Presidential act, the pardon<br />\nof Vietnam draft evaders, dissatisfied quite a few people on<br />\nboth the right and left. The semantics of \"pardon\" and<br />\n\"amnesty\" can be debated, and the whole question of<br />\ndeserters has been neglected, but at least Carter has<br />\ndemonstrated a willingness to take some action (in his first<br />\nweek, yet), inconclusive and compromised as it may be.<br />\nWe hope a Carter presidency will act as swiftly on the<br />\nmatter of \"our ultimate goal -- the elimination of all nuclear<br />\nweapons from this earth.\" Granted, an inaugural address<br />\ndoes not add up to much more than _twenty pages of<br />\nhistory-tinged rhetoric and familiar ideals, but Carter has<br />\nthe chance to act decisively in the next few months. His<br />\ncampaign promises of cancelling the B-1 bomber program<br />\nand cutting five to seven billion dollars from the defense<br />\nbudget can be carried through; whether Carter has the<br />\ndesire to cross the Pentagon brass and powerful pro-military<br />\ncongressmen remains to be seen.<br />\nJames Dickey's Inaugural poem closed with the lines \"I<br />\nwill do what I can.\" Jimmy Carter, the outsider in town,<br />\nhas a great opportunity to shake up the Washington<br />\nestablishment.<br /><br />\n'By STEVE SCHULTZ<br />\nFor a nation that poses as one<br />\never looking to the future, the<br />\nCarter \"pardon\" is a fundamental<br />\nmistake if we are to learn from<br />\nthe past. Carter's intent is to<br />\n\"close the book\" on the Vietnam<br />\ndebacle and to portray American<br />\nforeign policy as a \"mistake.\"<br />\nThe \"carterization\" of the<br />\nSoutheast Asian war, under the<br />\nguise of rhetoric proclaiming a<br />\n\"new\" unity and spirit,<br />\nrepresents nothing less than a<br />\nre-writing of history. To deny all<br />\nmemory of the war is to prevent<br />\nan understanding of the conflict.<br />\nIt is aimed at aborting a national<br />\nexamination of the nature of the<br />\nwar in which over 56,000<br />\nAmerican boys were killed, over<br />\n300,000 GIs were wounded, and<br />\nmillions of Vietnamese,<br />\nCambodians, and Laotians were<br />\nkilled, maimed, and made<br />\nhomeless.<br /><br />\na whole during the '60s and early<br />\n70s suffered countless<br />\ndocumented as well as<br />\nundocumented acts of sabatoge<br />\nfrom intelligence agencies who<br />\nbelieved it their job to monitor<br />\nand regulate the thought<br />\nprocesses for American citizens.<br />\nCarter, in the midst of the<br />\ncampaign, labelled the Vietnam<br />\nWar as \"racist\" yet he has issued<br />\na proclamation that is implicitly<br />\nrace-biased, class-based, and<br />\npunitive in regard to those<br />\nexcluded. An historian of the<br />\nmilitary during the Vietnam War<br />\nhas stated: \"Military deserters<br />\nhave done the same as draft<br />\nresisters in refusing to participate<br />\nin the military, except that they<br /><br />\nUniversal<br />\nIn pursuing the more<br />\n\"moderate\" course, Carter<br />\nlimited his pardon to the smallest<br />\nconstituency of Vietnam-era war<br />\nresisters that needed universal<br />\nand unconditional anmesty. His<br />\nproclamation pertains only , to<br />\ndraft evaders\u2014those who refused<br />\nto register as well as those who<br />\nchose foreign exile. According to<br />\nJustice Department figures, the<br />\nlatter category approximates<br />\n10,000.<br />\nDuring the campaign for the<br />\nDemocratic Presidential<br />\nnomination, candidate Jimmy<br />\nCarter stated: \"I don't have the<br />\ndesire- to punish anyone.\"<br />\nPresident Carter has excluded<br />\nfrom his pardon some 790,000<br />\nVietnam veterans with<br />\nless-than-honorable discharges<br />\nand approximately 40,000<br />\ndeserters-at-large. This will<br />\nprobably not be the last time<br />\nthat there exists a gap between<br />\nrhetoric and reality (look at his<br />\neconomic proposals, for<br />\nexample.)<br />\nAlso neglected under the<br />\nCarter pardon are tens of<br />\nthousands of civilian resisters<br />\nwith \"criminal records\" or still<br />\nimprisoned. The latter were often<br />\nillegally arrested, viciously<br />\nharrassed, convicted, and<br />\nimprisoned for their opposition<br />\nto the war. Scores of Americans<br />\nwere subject to frame-ups in<br />\npolitical trials for their anti-war<br />\nactivism. The peace movement as<br /><br />\nMARGULIES<br />\nElla<br /><br />\nslick<br />\nWe saw something funny the other day. There was an<br />\ninspired bit of slapstick as some poor student tried to cross<br />\n34th Street between McCoy and Wohnan Halls. He was<br />\ncarrying two bags of groceries and could -hardly see where<br />\nhe was going. It was hilarious as we watched the guy step<br />\noff the curb and begin slipping and sliding on the ice that<br />\nhad replaced lthe pavement. He held his balance for a few<br />\nseconds, then whoops! he fell. We thought we'd bust a gut<br />\nas we saw oranges and cans roll down the street. Charlie<br />\nChaplin couldn't have done better!<br />\nBut seriously: it seems that the University could have<br />\ndone somethiN where, the city had failed.

Most of these<br />\nprivileged resisters faced the draft<br />\nin their mid-twenties.<br />\nPoorer people,<br /><br />\ndisproportionately from black<br />\nand other minority groups as well<br />\nas working-class whites, faced the<br />\ndraft at eighteen. Having but<br />\nlimited exposure to anti-war<br />\nsentiment and counseling, they<br />\nlearned about the war firsthand,<br />\nafter induction. As a result, they<br />\nresisted from within the<br />\nAmerican military machine.<br />\nMany deserted but many more<br />\nsuffered less-than- honorable<br />\ndischarges, a guaranteed ticket to<br />\nthe unemployment line.<br />\nOver 9 0 % of the<br />\nless-than-honorable discharges are<br />\nissued administratively without<br />\nany due process for \"offenses\"<br />\nthat have no parallel in civilian<br />\nlaw. They served the purpose of<br />\nrepressing anti-war activity and<br />\npunishing \"malcontents.\" The<br />\nendemic racism of the military is<br />\nreflected in the fact that most of<br />\nthese discharges were given to<br />\nminority peoples.<br />\nWhile the civilian anti-war<br />\nmovement .(and not \"liberal\"<br />\npoliticians) Splayed a major role in<br />\nour withdrawal from Southeast<br />\nAsia, little is known about the<br />\nresistance within the military. A<br />\nspontaneous rejection of the war<br />\nwas one of the most<br />\ncharacteristic features of GI<br />\nopposition. Demonstrations on<br />\nmilitary bases, GI newspapers,<br />\nactivist coffeehouses, and<br />\nend-the-war petitions all stand as<br />\ncourageous acts of resistance on<br />\nthe part of men in uniform. At<br />\nfirst, there were literally<br />\nhundreds of incidents involving<br />\nindividual soldiers, and, later,<br />\nentire units who refused combat<br />\norders in Vietnam.<br />\nCarter's pardons continue to<br />\naggravate, rather than alleviate,<br />\npostwar wounds. The U.S.<br />\ngovernment has continually acted<br />\nto pit groups of war victims<br />\nagainst each other: those who<br />\nfought, believing its lies, those<br />\nwho chose to resist, MIA (missing<br />\nin action) families, POWs, etc.<br />\nNow Carter is pitting the draft<br />\nevader against the lower-income<br />\npost-induction war resister.<br />\nDivisiveness, rather than<br />\nconcord, will remain untill.a total<br />\nand unconditional amnesty is<br />\ngranted for all draft resisters.<br />\nSuch an amnesty will not only<br />\nrestore the rights of Americans<br />\nwho opposed the war but would.<br />\nhopefully, educate and inform all<br />\nAmericans of the character of<br />\nAmerican intervention for more<br />\nthan a decade.<br /><br />\n-s<br />\niso<br />\n-lI\u2014 ar<br />\nVOMISES<br />\nNOW PLAYING<br /><br />\n\u2022 lkia<br /><br />\nIlls NMI<br />\n11111Pula<br />\nIBM<br /><br />\n0111111111.<br /><br />\nGONE<br />\nWITH<br />\nTHE<br />\nWIND<br /><br />\nNMI<br />\nimUngiVismilmaiiniaraiesisommi<br /><br />\nLTr<br /><br />\ndr_ 1<br />\ngia<br />\nmum<br />\nss<br />\ndBillialb<br />\n1=11111111<br />\n1111111.1<br />\n11111illimiliiiii<br />\nMai<br />\nMaim<br />\ngewm\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022<br />\n11111111111.111111<br />\nWanimpari<br />\nINNIIIMM<br />\nIDA.1111enom<br />\n1011110110111im<br />\n1.110111011111111.1 dIIIIIIHIBM=iillelliONSIP<br />\nuj<br />\nmain<br /><br />\nJimmy walks among plain folk,<br />\nbrings along the peanut omelette<br />\ncontinued from cover<br />\nSo fifteen people climbed<br />\naboard a Greyhound Inaugural<br />\nBus special Thursday morning<br />\nwith the only special feature a<br />\nterminal point near the Capitol,<br />\nrather than at the far-off station<br />\non 14th Street.

Wearing a tweed<br />\nsuit and tan hat with a duck<br />\nfeather in the hat band, he<br />\nPuffed and grunted his advice to<br /><br />\nConstitution Avenues with<br />\nCapitol Street at the base.<br />\nMoving in from all directions,<br />\nthey sent the scores of city cops<br />\ninto a dutiful frenzy of<br />\nwhistle- blowing<br />\nand<br />\nhand-signalling.<br />\nTo cross the bordering streets<br />\nand actually get on Capitol<br />\ngrounds, one needed a ticket of<br />\nsome sort. Certain People carried<br />\nblue tickets and gained quick<br />\nentrance; many others had yellow passes and seemed to flow<br />\naround the grounds perimeter<br />\nuntil they reached an uncrowded<br />\nsection to shove through. In<br />\nsome spots, hundreds of people<br />\njoined together, clamoring for<br />\nadmission, and a few beleaguered<br />\nguards shouted and tried to<br />\nmaintain order. The policemen<br />\nwould call for \"only those with<br />\nyellow tickets!\", and a sea of<br />\nhands would wave yellow cards<br />\nin the air, giving off a loud cheer<br />\nlike a football crowd. Some<br />\nnon-ticket holders mingled with<br />\nthe rest managed to edge in<br /><br />\nal.)<br />\n, who would listen. \"You'd<br />\nbetter watch out when you get<br />\noff,\" he warned.\"Those bastards<br />\nwill pick your pockets clean.<br />\nThey work in groups\u2014one of<br />\nthem bumps into you,smoking a<br />\nCigarette, another reaches right<br />\ninto your coat or pants and grabs<br />\nYour wallet.

Three<br />\nPickpockets were arrested that<br />\nday, the most prevalent crime<br />\nout of a total of seven minor<br />\noffenses. In the sole accident of<br />\nthe Inauguration, a woman fell<br />\nfrom her horse during the parade<br />\nand suffered slight bruises.<br />\nPickpockets and unlicensed<br />\nvendors\u2014hardly the threat of<br />\nviolence in the streets that<br />\nbrought out the Guard four years<br />\nago. For the People's Inaugural,<br />\nthe only employment the<br />\nmilitary got was to take<br />\njackhammers and flame throwers<br />\nto the heavy ice on the main<br />\nroads.<br />\nAs the day moved closer to the<br />\nnoon swearing-in time, the<br />\nPeople began to mass around the<br />\nCapitol area. Early arrivals had<br />\nsecured the highest stair points<br />\non the buildings surrounding the<br />\nCapitol; their hours of waiting<br />\nmade them placid frozen<br />\nCompanions to the marble<br />\ngargoyles. The crowds pushed<br />\ninto the small rectangle bounded<br />\nby Independence and<br /><br />\nunnoticea, the majority,however,<br />\nwere warded off by a string of<br />\nparatroopers stationed at<br />\ntwo-foot intervals around the<br />\nCapitol. The paratroopers, with<br />\ntheir funny purple felt caps and<br />\nheavy black boots, stood firmly<br />\nwith their backs to the crowd,<br />\nready for any orders from the<br />\ncommand tent.<br />\nMeanwhile, the ticketless had<br />\nbegun to realize that the yellow<br />\npasses weren't worth too much.<br />\nThe passes, it turned out, had<br />\nbeen freely handed out by<br />\ncongressmen to anyone claiming<br />\nto be a constituent. One had only<br />\nto go to a nearby office building<br />\nand hit up the first representative<br />\nfor a fistful of yellow tickets.<br />\nThus the large crowd of yellow<br />\nticket holders, once granted<br />\naccess to the Capitol lawn, would<br />\nmove liberated toward the<br />\nswearing-in platform, only to<br />\nfind themselves roped off a good<br />\ndistance behind the reserved<br />\nseating area. The few \u2022 thousand<br />\ngrey fold-up plastic chairs,<br />\nincidentally, were the same seats<br />\nused for the Moon \"God Bless<br />\nAmerica\" Festival four months<br />\nbefore; the National Park Service<br />\nplays no favorites.<br />\nExcept for the people in the<br />\nfront lines on the Capitol<br />\ngrounds, then, yellow-ticket<br />\nholders and plain spectators were<br />\nequal\u2014they shared obstructed<br />\nviews and muffled speeches. In<br />\nfact, for those at the far end of<br /><br />\nthe area, along the Library of<br />\nCongress and Supreme Court, the<br />\nvoice of the speakers came first<br />\nover a hand-held transistor radio,<br />\nand then a second or two later<br />\nover the amplification system.<br />\nThis technical phenomenon<br />\nlulled the exuberance of the<br />\nceremony: Jimmy Carter took<br />\nthe oath of office, his words<br />\ncrackling on the radio, to be<br />\nfollowed by the \"live\" sound at<br />\nthe \"instant\" of the swearing-in.<br />\nThe people had come to be<br />\nactual witnesses to this historic<br />\noccasion, accepting a good<br />\ndistance away and the principals<br />\nout of sight, and now they found<br />\nthemselves oddly cheated out of<br />\ntheir personal connection,<br />\nthwarted by some impersonal<br />\nelectronic quirk.<br />\nDuring Carter's inaugural<br />\naddress, the crowd cheered about<br />\na half-dozen times, a reserved<br />\napplause that would spread<br />\noutward as those up close<br />\nclapped first and provided a cue.<br />\nThe speech carried fairly well<br /><br />\nover the many outdoor speakers,<br />\nbut it required strict<br />\nconcentration to follow every<br />\nword, and every word seemed<br />\njust like the preceding one, a<br />\ngeneral term expressing hope and<br />\ndreams and faith and other<br />\ntrusted cliches. Under those<br />\nconditions, the crowd did not<br />\npay rapt attentiont throughout<br />\nthe ,sixteen -minute speech and<br />\nrelated songs and statements;<br /><br />\nmany of those yellow-ticket<br />\nholders formed a steady file<br />\nstreaming out of the gates in the<br />\nmidst of the address. The people<br />\nwent off in hope of a better<br />\nvantage point for the parade, or<br />\nto get something to eat, or to<br />\nperhaps catch an early bus home<br />\nalready.<br />\nWith such a large number of<br />\npeople about, the street vendors<br />\nand souvenir hucksters came in<br />\nforce to Washington. Many<br />\npeople sported green Carter ski<br />\ncaps and T-shirts, wore buttons<br />\nof all description and rattled<br />\npeanut , key chains and necklaces,<br />\nwaved Carter pennants and<br />\ncollected 3-D Carter postcards.<br />\nThey might not have been able to<br />\nexperience the Inauguration, but<br />\nthey certainly could buy a little<br />\npart of it, a bit of memorabilia to<br />\ngo with the out-of-focus<br />\nphotographs.<br />\nThere was also a government<br />\nvan parked on the corner of First<br />\nand Capitol, advertising \"Free<br />\nImmunization\" in bright red<br />\nletters. The Swine Flu Bus failed<br />\nto draw any shot-takers, alkind<br />\nof empty postscript to the<br />\noutgoing presidency. After the<br />\nswearing-in, the Ford helicopter<br />\nhovered over the Capitol and<br />\nthen sped off, leaving behind the<br />\nunvisited immunization van and<br />\nthe rest of the capital.<br />\nDown the southeast end of<br />\n' Pennsylvania Avenue, the local<br />\ncafes and restaurants were doing<br />\nbrisk business, packed with<br />\ncustomer tryin the seanut<br /><br />\nomelette aud hominy grits. At<br />\nthe Tune Inn, people stood<br />\ntwo-deep around the bar,<br />\ndrinking Jim Beam doubles and<br />\ncomfortably (watching the parade<br />\non the color TV set. Carter's<br />\nappearance hefted a few scattered<br />\ncomments; when brother Billy's<br />\nface poked onto the screen,<br />\nhowever, the bar erupted into a<br />\ntoast for Billy C., glasses held<br />\nhigh and a quarter slapped in the<br />\njukebox to play a Mel Tillis<br />\nnumber.<br />\nThe Inaugural parade, from<br />\nthe Capitol down Pennsylvania<br />\nAvenue to the White House,<br />\nallowed over 300,000 people to<br />\nvie for front-row places along the<br />\nmile-and-a-half route, rather than<br />\nhalf that number trying to<br />\nsqueeze onto the Capitol<br />\ngrounds.
