There .may be marginal areas in which limits would<br />\nhave to be placed on private<br />\nAmerican industry and the government may have to go into the<br />\nsame areas on its own hook (as<br />\na trader).\"<br />\n<br />\nAmericans have tended to draw<br />\nan analogy from the personal<br />\nfreedom of individual American<br />\ncitizens to the international<br />\nfreedom of nations. Since American personal freedom was dependent on exact legal equality,<br />\nMr. Kennan continued, Americans expected nations to be<br />\nequated under international law.<br />\nTherefore, the \"crazy-quilt\" of<br />\nEurope-the result of political,<br />\nhistorical, and geographical differences was \"contrary, to the<br />\nAmerican concept of \"international egalitarianism.\"<br />\n<br />\nThe problems to be met in<br />\nthese areas have arisen, Mr. Kennan felt, for three reasons: first,<br />\n\"We are promoting the farmingout (among many sovereignties)<br />\nof the control of the sources of<br />\nindustrial raw materials\"; second, \"We continue to concede<br />\nthe power of (those) sovereignties to concede or deny resources<br />\nat will\"; third, \"We are permitting technological trends in our<br />\nsociety (a growing need for resources from foreign nations) to<br />\nmake the situation more acute.\"<br />\nThe \"situation\" needing correction, Mr. Kennan said, is the<br />\nresultant disparity between<br />\n\"what resources we demand and<br />\nwhat we can get.\"<br />\n<br />\nArising in the last 50 years,<br />\nMr. Kennan pointed out, partly<br />\nas a result of American promotion of the sovereignty concept,<br />\nhave been 50 new nations, many<br />\nof them \"with a shallow experience with the responsibilities of<br />\nsovereignty.\" Stipulating the importance of common recognition<br />\nof responsibility between interdependent nations, the lecturer<br />\nsaid, \"I shudder to think that we<br />\nare permitting ourselves to be-<br />\n<br />\ncome dependent on others for<br />\nsuch important commodities as<br />\niron ore and oil without making<br />\nknown to ourselves and the<br />\nothers our ... responsibilities. If<br />\never we find ourselves suddenly<br />\ndenied by the outside world' a<br />\nnecessity to our life, I wouldn't<br />\nwant to vouch for our own behavior.\"<br />\nAccentuating the problem of<br />\nresources, Mr. Kennan suggested, is the \"growing dependance<br />\nof our country on sources of raw<br />\nmaterials beyond our borders\" as<br />\nthe result of \"the progressive exhaustion of certain resources,\" an<br />\nunexpectedly large population<br />\ngrowth bringing consumption<br />\nwhich has outstripped technological advancements. \"We belong,\" he said, \"to the more<br />\nfragile part of international society.\"<br />\n<br />\nConfusion and frustration have been the only products of the Student Council's attempts to outline a means<br />\nof regulating undergraduate discipline.

There .may be marginal areas in which limits would<br />\nhave to be placed on private<br />\nAmerican industry and the government may have to go into the<br />\nsame areas on its own hook (as<br />\na trader).\"<br /><br />\nAmericans have tended to draw<br />\nan analogy from the personal<br />\nfreedom of individual American<br />\ncitizens to the international<br />\nfreedom of nations. Since American personal freedom was dependent on exact legal equality,<br />\nMr. Kennan continued, Americans expected nations to be<br />\nequated under international law.<br />\nTherefore, the \"crazy-quilt\" of<br />\nEurope-the result of political,<br />\nhistorical, and geographical differences was \"contrary, to the<br />\nAmerican concept of \"international egalitarianism.\"<br /><br />\nThe problems to be met in<br />\nthese areas have arisen, Mr. Kennan felt, for three reasons: first,<br />\n\"We are promoting the farmingout (among many sovereignties)<br />\nof the control of the sources of<br />\nindustrial raw materials\"; second, \"We continue to concede<br />\nthe power of (those) sovereignties to concede or deny resources<br />\nat will\"; third, \"We are permitting technological trends in our<br />\nsociety (a growing need for resources from foreign nations) to<br />\nmake the situation more acute.\"<br />\nThe \"situation\" needing correction, Mr. Kennan said, is the<br />\nresultant disparity between<br />\n\"what resources we demand and<br />\nwhat we can get.\"<br /><br />\nArising in the last 50 years,<br />\nMr. Kennan pointed out, partly<br />\nas a result of American promotion of the sovereignty concept,<br />\nhave been 50 new nations, many<br />\nof them \"with a shallow experience with the responsibilities of<br />\nsovereignty.\" Stipulating the importance of common recognition<br />\nof responsibility between interdependent nations, the lecturer<br />\nsaid, \"I shudder to think that we<br />\nare permitting ourselves to be-<br /><br />\ncome dependent on others for<br />\nsuch important commodities as<br />\niron ore and oil without making<br />\nknown to ourselves and the<br />\nothers our ... responsibilities. If<br />\never we find ourselves suddenly<br />\ndenied by the outside world' a<br />\nnecessity to our life, I wouldn't<br />\nwant to vouch for our own behavior.\"<br />\nAccentuating the problem of<br />\nresources, Mr. Kennan suggested, is the \"growing dependance<br />\nof our country on sources of raw<br />\nmaterials beyond our borders\" as<br />\nthe result of \"the progressive exhaustion of certain resources,\" an<br />\nunexpectedly large population<br />\ngrowth bringing consumption<br />\nwhich has outstripped technological advancements. \"We belong,\" he said, \"to the more<br />\nfragile part of international society.\"<br /><br />\nConfusion and frustration have been the only products of the Student Council's attempts to outline a means<br />\nof regulating undergraduate discipline.
