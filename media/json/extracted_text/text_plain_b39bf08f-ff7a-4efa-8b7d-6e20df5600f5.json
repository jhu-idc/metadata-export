This<br />\n114.81,<br />\nis not the proper spirit. For one thing, older men who come out to<br />\nsee these games want to get back again for a short time into the college atmosphere; they want<br />\nto feel that for a few mintues they can go back and join in the thing with something of the<br />\nold-time enthusiasm. Such men will not start the song or the cheer, but given the opportunity, their voices will help to swell the song as lustily as ever did the alumni of Princeton or<br />\nYale. Then, too, the men who are working out on the field want to hear 'The Call of the Wild\"<br />\nbehind them; they want to feel that every move is being watched, that the pent-up enthusiasm<br />\nis going to break out whenever a play is made that deserves it. The man on the team wants<br />\nto feel that the Hopkins spirit is there to back him up. Yet on the day of that glorious<br />\nvictory over Harvard, the grandstand was as cold and dignified as a commencement day<br />\nfaculty.

Much more money is being<br />\nspent on material things than is necessary,<br />\nand the cause of higher education is suffering<br />\nin consequence. Certain expensive equipments are essential, but a pace is being set in<br />\nthe cost of buildings that is likely to react<br />\ndisastrously. Million-dollar laboratories and<br />\nlibraries are all very well. How far is it wise<br />\nto put so much in buildings and then allow<br />\nthe occupants to languish for the necessaries<br />\nof intellectual life, is a question that is not<br />\ndifficult to answer.<br />\n\"The speaker then continued: 'In some<br />\nquarters, abundant money has been furnished<br />\nfor the material needs of the universities, and<br />\nperhaps for the intellectual needs.- The magnificence of the result has stirred the authorities in other quarters to try to follow suit, and<br />\na great burden has been placed upon those<br />\ncharged with the conduct of affairs.

The game put up by the future engi-<br />\n<br />\nunbounded confidence\" that we went up to<br />\nPennsylvania.<br />\n<br />\nneers was the fastest we had up to the time<br />\nmet, and the contest was the best of the home<br />\nleague games.<br />\nThe Hopkins play showed a marked improvement over the game shown the Lehigh team,<br />\nand though the final result never appeared<br />\ndoubtful, still Stevens made things interesting.<br />\n<br />\nmore, the game that was to decide the championship of 1909. From time to time rumors<br />\nof the strong team Swathmore had this year<br />\nhad reached us, and it was far from \"with<br />\n<br />\nAs it proved, however, the fears were without foundation, for while the game was a<br />\nhard one it was not, as the score shows,<br />\nSwathmore's scoring ability that made it so,<br />\nbut rather their style of play. As usual,<br />\nSwathmore played a rough and tumble,<br />\ncatch-as-catch-can, \"body-check hard and<br />\nstick on the man if not on the ball\" game<br />\nthat went out of fashion at Hopkins years<br />\n<br />\n\fTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\n<br />\nago, when we were learning that it is wasting<br />\ntime to chase the man when you might be<br />\nshooting at the goal. The effectiveness of<br />\ntheir style of play, as they see it, is evidenced<br />\nby the display of court plaster and bandages<br />\nthat our team treated their fellow-students to<br />\non their return to Baltimore. The effectiveness of our system of lacrosse, however, is<br />\nshown by the fact that Swathmore's fine goal<br />\nkeeper was peppered with shots, and it is only<br />\ndue to his good stopping that the score was<br />\nnot even greater than it was in our favor.<br />\nThe team played its best game up at Swathmore. Individual stick work and collective<br />\nteam work were both better than in any of the<br />\nother contests, and that old dash and ginger<br />\nthat times seemed to be lacking this year were<br />\nboth very much in evidence. As usual, we<br />\nplayed faster and faster as the game went on,<br />\nand five of the goals shot in the second half<br />\nwere tallied in time that must be a record for<br />\nrapid scoring. When the game was over,<br />\nwhich was not till late due to delays on the<br />\npart of the umpire, who took an unexplainably inexpressably long time to put the ball<br />\nin play after a tally, the score was, Hopkins,<br />\n14\u2014Swathmore, 3.<br />\n<br />\nBaltimore, Md., May 5th, 1909.<br />\nTo the Editor of the NEWS-LETTER,<br />\nDEAR SIR:\u2014<br />\nAfter reading the letter in the last issue of<br />\nthe NEWS-LETTER, signed '`An Undergraduate,\" in which the writer decries the idea of<br />\nan alumni lacrosse team on the ground that<br />\nsuch a team will eclipse the 'varsity in honor<br />\ndue it and decrease the interest in the undergraduate team, it occurred to me that I might<br />\nperhaps throw a little light upon the matter,<br />\nparticularly in regard to the Toronto game.<br />\nThis year, as heretofore, the 'varsity team<br />\nhas had its full and proper schedule. This<br />\nschedule will always remain about as long as<br />\nat present, the only change which can be<br />\nmade from year to year being the substitution<br />\nof teams; and this can only be done as new<br />\nteams, worthy of our recognition, make their<br />\nappearance in lacrosse circles.<br />\nThe present schedule is without criticism<br />\nwhen all ends are taken into consideration;<br />\n<br />\n7<br />\n<br />\nthat is to say, looked at from the physical condition of the men in order to get a championship team, and the manager's aim to end the<br />\nseason successfully from a financial standpoint.<br />\nIt is out of the question for the 'varsity<br />\nteam to play Toronto, except only in a few<br />\nisolated instances, as our season is over before<br />\ntheirs has fairly commenced. They seldom<br />\ntake a Southern trip as early as the one last<br />\nyear, as other big teams, like the Crescents in<br />\nNew York, prefer, if they play them, to do so<br />\nlater in the season. Last year, therefore,<br />\nwas an exception to the rule, and the organization of an alumni team has had nothing to<br />\ndo with cutting out that game or any other<br />\ngame, if such had been thought feasible, and<br />\nhad been possible.<br />\nI might add that if we had not been blessed<br />\nwith a. clear day last year when the Toronto<br />\ngame was played, that the manager would have<br />\nhad a sorry account to turn in to the Athletic<br />\nBoard at the end of the season.<br />\nThere is little in the writer's contention<br />\nthat the alumni will be a better team and<br />\naccordingly draw the crowds. Such a team,<br />\non the other hand, has the effect of stimulating lacrosse interest in larger circles, and<br />\nthus tending to increase the interest of the<br />\npublic generally, with the corresponding result that all audiences will be larger and more<br />\nenthusiastic.<br />\nIt is also a well recognized fact among all<br />\nathletic circles that the best way to get a<br />\nchampionship team in any sport is to have<br />\nanother good team on which, or with which,<br />\nto practice. The alumni have commenced to<br />\nfill this position this year, as shown by the<br />\nnumerous mid-week contests. The results of<br />\nsuch training are already evident, and will be<br />\nmuch more so next year when our undergraduate team will be composed of more<br />\ninexperienced men than at present.<br />\nSuch criticisms as advanced by the writer,<br />\nwho signs himself 'An Undergraduate,\"<br />\nshow a lack of insight into, not only the<br />\ntraining and practice of a team, but also of<br />\nmanaging and financing a successful series of<br />\ngames.<br />\nJ. PURDON WRIGHT,<br />\nManager 1908.<br />\n<br />\n\fTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\n<br />\n8<br />\n<br />\nTHE HISTORY OF LACROSSE AT<br />\nJOHNS HOPKINS.<br />\nBY WILLIAM C. SCHMECISSER.<br />\nNovember 10, 1908.<br />\n<br />\n(Continued).<br />\n1901.<br />\nWith the year 1901 we come to the fourth<br />\nsuccessive season that the University turned<br />\nout a highly creditable lacrosse team. Under<br />\nCaptain Edward Tyler, Jr., we had the<br />\nlightest aggregation that ever represented the<br />\n\"Black and the Blue,\"and the attack was often<br />\nreferred to as Hopkins \"flying attack,\" or<br />\nthe \"mosquito fleet.\"<br />\nThe team certainly reached its high-water<br />\nmark, although early in the season, at the<br />\ntime of its Crescent game, which it defeated<br />\non their home grounds in a pouring rain<br />\nby the score of 3 to 1. The first time that<br />\nthe \"new moon men\" had been beaten by a<br />\ncollege team in eleven years. The explanation of this feat is simply this: That it was a<br />\nwet day, Crescents did not have their best team<br />\nout, Hopkins was in perfect physical condition<br />\nand ran them off their feet, at the same time<br />\nplaying faultless lacrosse.<br />\nBefore the Crescent game Hopkins had<br />\nbeaten All Baltimore, University of Pennsylvania and afterwards the College of the City<br />\nof New York. Columbia University fell before our light attack before we met Harvard.<br />\nThe day for the Harvard game\u2014Monday<br />\nbefore the Swarthmore one\u2014was ideal, and<br />\nour manager, Harry Byrne, had been very<br />\ndiligent in seeing that it was properly advertised, with the result that about fifteen hundred people journeyed out to the then called<br />\nAmerican League Park to see the contest.<br />\nHarvard's strength was a surprise; they had<br />\na large team on which were several Canadians,<br />\nand moreover, not only had they been coached<br />\nin the Hopkins style of play, but they also<br />\nhad Clarence Guggenheimer, who was at<br />\nthat time attending the Harvaid Law School,<br />\nbetween the posts. Hopkins won out in a<br />\nclose game by the score of 4 to 0. Most of<br />\nthe light attack, which averaged only 128<br />\npounds, was so used up that they did not recuperate in time for the Swarthmore game.<br />\nThe most noticeable playing up to now had<br />\nbeen that of Bertram Bernheini at out home,<br />\n<br />\nand B. Swayne Putts at in home. In this<br />\ntheir first year together they were developing<br />\na team play which made them the following<br />\nyear the best pair in front of goal that Hopkins<br />\nhas had to this day. Bernheim was a good,<br />\nhard shot, whereas Putts was a wonder at rebounds and placing quick shots when in<br />\nclose. \u2022<br />\nNext we come to the fatal Swarthmore<br />\ngame, when our boys were beaten by superior<br />\nphysical condition and fine goal-keeping on<br />\nthe part of Downing, Swathmore's goal-man.<br />\nThe first half ended in a tie, the score being<br />\n2-2; the second half was a terrific one and the<br />\n\"Black and the Blue\" had to give up first<br />\nplace, losing by she score of 4-2; her first<br />\ncollege game in four years.<br />\nSome who read this historical sketch will<br />\nwonder why no mention is made of our old<br />\nintercollegiate friends and opponents, Lehigh<br />\nand Stevens. The truth of the matter is,<br />\nthat after the rough game played with Stevens<br />\nin 1900, Hopkins refused to remain in the<br />\nleague as long as the Hoboken boys were in the<br />\nsame and withdrew from it. These differences were patched up before many seasons<br />\nand today all are good friends again.<br />\nEd.

The efforts of the coaches<br />\nwere directed more than ever, heretofore, towards team-work; and the lacrosse season<br />\nfound Johns Hopkins represented on the field<br />\nby what may be termed a moderately heavy<br />\nteam. Its stick-work was fast and in teamwork it excelled anything that has ever<br />\nrepresented the \"Black and the Blue.\" The<br />\nteam was uniform throughout and each<br />\nplayer did his part, making it thus of little<br />\navail for an opponent to try to keep a \"star\"<br />\nplayer out of the game. If one man was too<br />\nclosely pressed the others could get along<br />\nwithout him.<br />\nAfter playing a practice game with an All<br />\nBaltimore team, the University .opened its<br />\nregular season on Franklin Field with the<br />\nUniversity of Pennsylvania, defeating the<br />\nsame by a score of 5 to 1.

Score, 12 to 1.<br />\nNext came the annual game with Harvard.<br />\nIt was in this game, which was played in<br />\nBaltimore on the 19th of April, that the Hopkins team really first began to find itself.<br />\nAmid the applause of sixteen spectators, fair<br />\nHarvard was defeated to the tune of 11 to 1,<br />\nthe score hardly indicating the nature of the<br />\ngame. After this, Lehigh and Columbia<br />\nwere also forced to clear the way; for Hopkins<br />\nwas after the championship honors that she<br />\nhad lost the year before. In 1902, like in<br />\n1901, the final clash was between two teams,<br />\nneither of which had lost a college game<br />\nduring the entire season; it was Swarthmore<br />\nagainst Hopkins, champions against ex-champions.<br />\nBefore I give the details of this game, I<br />\nmust repeat, for those who have not heard it,<br />\nthe now old \"pistol story\" :<br />\nOn the Fridayl afternoon when the writer<br />\n<br />\n9<br />\n<br />\nwalked out on the platform of the Mt. Royal<br />\nStation, preparatory to escorting the team to<br />\nSouth Bethlehem, he suddenly caught sight<br />\nof a pistol barrel as it was quietly and unostentatiously bestowed in the deep recesses of a<br />\ndress-suit case. He only thought to himself,<br />\n\"Ah, this looks like a trip to Allentown after<br />\nthe game.\" Just then the train pulled in and<br />\nthis incident was forgotten in the rush of other<br />\nmatters. A rough reminder came, however,<br />\nthe following evening at 10.30 P. M., when<br />\nyours truly after lie had, as he thought, tucked<br />\nall of his charges safely away in bed, was<br />\nsitting peacefully in the hotel lobby waiting<br />\nfor two of the men who were expected on a<br />\nlate train, they having been detained at the<br />\nmedical school. Suddenly hurried footsteps<br />\nwere heard as a bell-boy rushed down the<br />\nsteps, and with palid countenance asked me<br />\nwhether I was manager of the Hopkins team,<br />\nadding that something terrible had happened.<br />\nBefore I could inform him that I was not<br />\nthe party wanted, my mind's eyes rested on<br />\nthat pistol, and I rushed to the third floor,<br />\nalmost getting there before I had started.<br />\nThis is what I saw as I looked down the long<br />\ncorridor: The manager of the hotel was<br />\nwalking up and down, wildly waving his<br />\narms and calling, \"get the police!\" while at<br />\neach door along that hallway appeared fantastic figures dressed, some in pajamas, and others<br />\nin the costumes that Shakespeare's ghosts generally wore. My first question was, \"What<br />\nis the matter here?\" to which the manager<br />\nreplied, \"A pistol has been shot off in number<br />\n325, and the door is locked, and\" \u2014 \u2014<br />\nThe manager was here interruped by a long,<br />\nlank individual, who had ventured out into<br />\nthe hall with his bath robe on, who, trembling<br />\nall, over said: \"Yes, my room is nearly opposite; I was just going to bed when I heard<br />\nquarrelling out in the hall, and, as I opened<br />\nthe door of my room to see what was the<br />\nmatter, I heard this dialogue: 'Yes, you<br />\nwill!' 'No, I won't!' 'Take this, then,' and<br />\n<br />\nci Hopkins<br />\n<br />\nmen have long been pleased with the<br />\nexcellence of the furnishings to be found in the<br />\nMen's Store at ::<br />\n<br />\nHUTZLER 1311TliE15<br />\n210-218 NORTH HOWARD ST.<br />\n<br />\n\f10<br />\n<br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\n<br />\nwith this an arm came out of number 325, and<br />\nI saw a pistol flash, followed by the exclamation, 'My God, I'm shot!' Then th door was<br />\nquickly closed and locked.\" After this recitation of horrors, another of the party who<br />\nwas crowding around showed us what he<br />\nthought was the place where the bullet had<br />\nlodged in the floor.<br />\nKnowing who had been assigned to room<br />\nnumber 325, and to the one opposite, and<br />\nseeing that none of our well-trained team even<br />\nstuck their heads out of the doors, it did not<br />\ntake the writer long to figure out that he was<br />\n\"up against\" a practical joke, which had<br />\nbeen such a success, that unless something<br />\nwas quickly done, some of our men would in<br />\nall probability be resting peacefully in the<br />\npolice headquarters when the game was to be<br />\ncalled next day.<br />\nA lengthy explanation to the manager and<br />\nthe search of number 325 for firearms, which<br />\nwere not found, did much to appease the<br />\nstout little gentleman, and the incident was<br />\nclosed by a general laugh on the part of the<br />\nmembers of the team, but not by the other'<br />\nguests, who warned their children the next<br />\nday to stay away from 'those dangerous men.\"<br />\nSwarthmore was played in Baltimore at the<br />\nAmerican League Park on May 11th before a<br />\nlarge audience. Lacrosse enthusiasm ran high<br />\nin the Monumentai City when our team, under<br />\nthe leadership of Capt. Schmeisser, once more<br />\nbrought back the championship banner by a<br />\nscore of 8 to 2. Both sides put up a great<br />\ngame, neither side scoring for twenty-five<br />\nminutes, when Palmer Bernheini, our third<br />\nattack,whose team-work with Abercrombie was<br />\none of the features of the game, started the<br />\nball rolling by shooting the first goal.<br />\nAnother goal by us, and good work by<br />\nBriscoe, our goal-tend, and the first half ended<br />\n2 to 1 in favor of Hopkins.<br />\nIn the second half, Hopkins team-work and<br />\nsuperior condition, the same quality which<br />\nhad won the game for Swarthmore the year<br />\nbefore, b?gan to tell; hence the final score.<br />\nHardly had the season ended, with the boys<br />\nout of training, getting ready for their final<br />\nexaminations, when the management received<br />\na challenge from the University of Toronto to<br />\nplay in New York or Baltimore for the Championship of America. The possibility of such<br />\na game was thoroughly discussed; and it was<br />\n<br />\ndecided that the Baltimore public was ripe for<br />\nsuch a contest. Now, owing to the fact that examination dates conflicted with the Canadians'<br />\nSouthern trip, it was determined to induce<br />\nthem to make a special trip from Toronto and<br />\nand play in Baltimore on the 11th of June, the<br />\nday after the annual Hopkins Commencement.<br />\nThe Canadians accepted, so it became necessary for the Hopkins management to collect<br />\nthe team. Some of the medical students had<br />\nalready left the city; but a trip from Kentucky<br />\nto Baltimore was readily undertaken, so as to<br />\nplace on the field against Toronto the same<br />\nteam which had won from Swarthmore.<br />\nThe men once more went into strict training, and the management did its part to make<br />\nthe event a success. A committee, consisting<br />\nof some of Baltimore's most prominent citizens,<br />\nwaited on President Roosevelt in person, and<br />\ninvited him to be present at the game; but as<br />\nluck would have it, June 11th was also the<br />\nday of the great West Point celebration, and<br />\nthe President's duty was elsewhere than in<br />\nBaltimore. Invitations were also extended to<br />\nthe State and civil authorities.<br />\nThe efforts of the management succceded<br />\nfar beyond expectations, for when the<br />\nToronto team took the field, an applause<br />\nfrom an audience, which nearly filled<br />\nthe stands of the park, greeted the visitors.<br />\nThe local papers estimated the attendance at<br />\nfive thousand.

At four o'clock when Mr. Doyle, of<br />\nthe Crescent Athletic Club, who had come<br />\nover from New York City to referee this<br />\ngame, blew his whistle the greatest athletic<br />\nevent Baltimore had ever seen up to that time,<br />\nwas on.<br />\nThe contest was very interesting. Hopkins<br />\nknew it had only a fighting chance to win,<br />\nwhereas on the other hand the best American<br />\ncollege team was somewhat of an unknown<br />\nproblem for the Toronto men. For some time<br />\nneither team seemed to have the advantage,<br />\nboth sides played the best she knew how. It<br />\nwas not until after fifteen minutes of bard<br />\nplay that Toronto scored the first point of the<br />\ngame. Immediately Hopkins with fine team<br />\nwork, worked the ball d own into t Ii e<br />\nCanadians' territory only to have the ball<br />\nblocked time and time again by the visitors'<br />\nstar goal-man. The Northern boys scored a<br />\nsecond time and then our boys put one in the<br />\nnet<br />\nShortly after this, about four minutes before<br />\nthe end of the first half, Hopkins executed a<br />\nteam play which I doubt has ever been duplicated by any team in the country before or<br />\nafter that day. The ball had been brought to<br />\nthe centre of the field and placed for a faceoff when as tile referee's whistle Abercrombie,<br />\nour center, drew the ball from Wood, the<br />\nToronto's centre, into the stick of Hopkins<br />\nthird attack, who in turn advanced it to the<br />\nnext attack man; and so the ball sped on from<br />\nman to man, in nearly a direct line towards<br />\ngoal, touching the stick of every man on that<br />\nteam.<br />\nThe applause of the spectators gradually increased in volume as the ball advanced so<br />\nswiftly and cleanly until the crowd fairly<br />\nburst into a roar, when our famous Putts, with<br />\nhis characteristic twist, placed it in the net,<br />\nmaking the score a tie, each side having two.<br />\nIn the second half the experience of Toronto<br />\ngot the better of our men. Changing the<br />\nmethod of their attack completely, they gradually worked the ball through the Hopkins<br />\ndefense for several goals. Thus Toronto won<br />\nthe game by a score of 6 to 2.<br />\nThe 1902 Champions lined up as follows:<br />\nStraith Briscoe,goal; William C. Schmeisser,<br />\npoint; E.

For one thing, older men who come out to<br />\nsee these games want to get back again for a short time into the college atmosphere; they want<br />\nto feel that for a few mintues they can go back and join in the thing with something of the<br />\nold-time enthusiasm. Such men will not start the song or the cheer, but given the opportunity, their voices will help to swell the song as lustily as ever did the alumni of Princeton or<br />\nYale. Then, too, the men who are working out on the field want to hear 'The Call of the Wild\"<br />\nbehind them; they want to feel that every move is being watched, that the pent-up enthusiasm<br />\nis going to break out whenever a play is made that deserves it. The man on the team wants<br />\nto feel that the Hopkins spirit is there to back him up.

Later the members adjourned to the university commons,<br />\nwhere dinner was served. Dr. Hall Cantor,<br />\npresident of the association, presided and<br />\nintroduced the speakers. Prof. W. M.<br />\nThornton, dean of the engineering school of<br />\nthe university, welcomed the visiting Hopkins<br />\nmen in fitting terms, and Arthur Hancock replied to the welcome.<br />\n\"Dr. Douglass Vanderhoof spoke on 'The<br />\nHopkins and Medicine.' He showed what a<br />\ndebt medical science in this country owed to<br />\nHopkins. Dr. J. H. Latane, in discussing<br />\nHopkins men in the South, said that there<br />\nwas hardly a college of any standing that did<br />\nnot have one or more Hopkins men in its<br />\nfaculty, and that they were well represented<br />\nin other lines of endeavor also.<br />\n'Dr. John W. Mallet spoke on 'Hopkins and<br />\nScience.' He said that Hopkins was the first<br />\nAmerican educational institution to make investigation and original research a prominent<br />\nfeature in its course of instruction, and that<br />\nthe country owed more to her for instituting<br />\nsuch work than for any one thing she had<br />\ndone.<br /><br />\nat Harvard, Columbia and Princeton, valuable<br />\nresults may confidently be expected.<br />\n\"WASTE OF MONEY.<br /><br />\n\"Dr. Remsen said he did not wish to underrate the importance of the material progress<br />\nof a university, but he did wish to say that,<br />\nin his opinion, there is at present a deplorable<br />\ntendency to extravagance in the management<br />\nof universities. Much more money is being<br />\nspent on material things than is necessary,<br />\nand the cause of higher education is suffering<br />\nin consequence. Certain expensive equipments are essential, but a pace is being set in<br />\nthe cost of buildings that is likely to react<br />\ndisastrously. Million-dollar laboratories and<br />\nlibraries are all very well. How far is it wise<br />\nto put so much in buildings and then allow<br />\nthe occupants to languish for the necessaries<br />\nof intellectual life, is a question that is not<br />\ndifficult to answer.<br />\n\"The speaker then continued: 'In some<br />\nquarters, abundant money has been furnished<br />\nfor the material needs of the universities, and<br />\nperhaps for the intellectual needs.- The magnificence of the result has stirred the authorities in other quarters to try to follow suit, and<br />\na great burden has been placed upon those<br />\ncharged with the conduct of affairs. They<br />\nhave been obliged to bestir themselves often<br />\nin unwonted ways to secure money. The<br />\nbegging college president has been evolved.<br />\nPity him, my friends.

Moreover our scores have been so decisive that<br /><br />\nThis was especially true in the early part of<br />\nthe second period when they netted the ball<br />\nthree times in about ten minutes of play.<br />\nThe Hopkins defence then took a brace, however, and our offence men coming in with a<br />\nrpsh finished the game in a fashion that took<br />\nthe Hoboken team off their feet. The score<br />\nat the end of the game stood Hopkins, 8\u2014<br />\nStevens, 3,\u2014a difference of five comfortable<br />\ngoals.<br /><br />\nthey cannot possibly give rise to any doubt<br />\nas to the very marked superiority of 1909 team<br />\nover it rivals for the championship. The<br />\nteam individually and collectively has done<br />\nsplendid work, and to pick out special heroes<br />\nwould be unjust, unless we were to give the<br />\nnames and sing of the feats of each man on<br /><br />\nAfter the victory over Stevens came a week<br />\nof hope and fear\u2014the week before the last<br />\ngame of the season, the game with Swath-<br /><br />\nthe squad.<br />\nThe beating of Navy, Harvard, and Lehigh<br />\nseemed to promised that Stevens, when they<br />\ncame down from New Jersey, would not<br />\nprove an uncrackable nut for Captain Frank's<br />\nmen. The game put up by the future engi-<br /><br />\nunbounded confidence\" that we went up to<br />\nPennsylvania.<br /><br />\nneers was the fastest we had up to the time<br />\nmet, and the contest was the best of the home<br />\nleague games.<br />\nThe Hopkins play showed a marked improvement over the game shown the Lehigh team,<br />\nand though the final result never appeared<br />\ndoubtful, still Stevens made things interesting.<br /><br />\nmore, the game that was to decide the championship of 1909. From time to time rumors<br />\nof the strong team Swathmore had this year<br />\nhad reached us, and it was far from \"with<br /><br />\nAs it proved, however, the fears were without foundation, for while the game was a<br />\nhard one it was not, as the score shows,<br />\nSwathmore's scoring ability that made it so,<br />\nbut rather their style of play. As usual,<br />\nSwathmore played a rough and tumble,<br />\ncatch-as-catch-can, \"body-check hard and<br />\nstick on the man if not on the ball\" game<br />\nthat went out of fashion at Hopkins years<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br /><br />\nago, when we were learning that it is wasting<br />\ntime to chase the man when you might be<br />\nshooting at the goal. The effectiveness of<br />\ntheir style of play, as they see it, is evidenced<br />\nby the display of court plaster and bandages<br />\nthat our team treated their fellow-students to<br />\non their return to Baltimore. The effectiveness of our system of lacrosse, however, is<br />\nshown by the fact that Swathmore's fine goal<br />\nkeeper was peppered with shots, and it is only<br />\ndue to his good stopping that the score was<br />\nnot even greater than it was in our favor.<br />\nThe team played its best game up at Swathmore. Individual stick work and collective<br />\nteam work were both better than in any of the<br />\nother contests, and that old dash and ginger<br />\nthat times seemed to be lacking this year were<br />\nboth very much in evidence. As usual, we<br />\nplayed faster and faster as the game went on,<br />\nand five of the goals shot in the second half<br />\nwere tallied in time that must be a record for<br />\nrapid scoring. When the game was over,<br />\nwhich was not till late due to delays on the<br />\npart of the umpire, who took an unexplainably inexpressably long time to put the ball<br />\nin play after a tally, the score was, Hopkins,<br />\n14\u2014Swathmore, 3.<br /><br />\nBaltimore, Md., May 5th, 1909.<br />\nTo the Editor of the NEWS-LETTER,<br />\nDEAR SIR:\u2014<br />\nAfter reading the letter in the last issue of<br />\nthe NEWS-LETTER, signed '`An Undergraduate,\" in which the writer decries the idea of<br />\nan alumni lacrosse team on the ground that<br />\nsuch a team will eclipse the 'varsity in honor<br />\ndue it and decrease the interest in the undergraduate team, it occurred to me that I might<br />\nperhaps throw a little light upon the matter,<br />\nparticularly in regard to the Toronto game.<br />\nThis year, as heretofore, the 'varsity team<br />\nhas had its full and proper schedule. This<br />\nschedule will always remain about as long as<br />\nat present, the only change which can be<br />\nmade from year to year being the substitution<br />\nof teams; and this can only be done as new<br />\nteams, worthy of our recognition, make their<br />\nappearance in lacrosse circles.<br />\nThe present schedule is without criticism<br />\nwhen all ends are taken into consideration;<br /><br />\n7<br /><br />\nthat is to say, looked at from the physical condition of the men in order to get a championship team, and the manager's aim to end the<br />\nseason successfully from a financial standpoint.<br />\nIt is out of the question for the 'varsity<br />\nteam to play Toronto, except only in a few<br />\nisolated instances, as our season is over before<br />\ntheirs has fairly commenced. They seldom<br />\ntake a Southern trip as early as the one last<br />\nyear, as other big teams, like the Crescents in<br />\nNew York, prefer, if they play them, to do so<br />\nlater in the season. Last year, therefore,<br />\nwas an exception to the rule, and the organization of an alumni team has had nothing to<br />\ndo with cutting out that game or any other<br />\ngame, if such had been thought feasible, and<br />\nhad been possible.<br />\nI might add that if we had not been blessed<br />\nwith a. clear day last year when the Toronto<br />\ngame was played, that the manager would have<br />\nhad a sorry account to turn in to the Athletic<br />\nBoard at the end of the season.<br />\nThere is little in the writer's contention<br />\nthat the alumni will be a better team and<br />\naccordingly draw the crowds. Such a team,<br />\non the other hand, has the effect of stimulating lacrosse interest in larger circles, and<br />\nthus tending to increase the interest of the<br />\npublic generally, with the corresponding result that all audiences will be larger and more<br />\nenthusiastic.<br />\nIt is also a well recognized fact among all<br />\nathletic circles that the best way to get a<br />\nchampionship team in any sport is to have<br />\nanother good team on which, or with which,<br />\nto practice. The alumni have commenced to<br />\nfill this position this year, as shown by the<br />\nnumerous mid-week contests. The results of<br />\nsuch training are already evident, and will be<br />\nmuch more so next year when our undergraduate team will be composed of more<br />\ninexperienced men than at present.<br />\nSuch criticisms as advanced by the writer,<br />\nwho signs himself 'An Undergraduate,\"<br />\nshow a lack of insight into, not only the<br />\ntraining and practice of a team, but also of<br />\nmanaging and financing a successful series of<br />\ngames.<br />\nJ. PURDON WRIGHT,<br />\nManager 1908.<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br /><br />\n8<br /><br />\nTHE HISTORY OF LACROSSE AT<br />\nJOHNS HOPKINS.<br />\nBY WILLIAM C. SCHMECISSER.<br />\nNovember 10, 1908.<br /><br />\n(Continued).<br />\n1901.<br />\nWith the year 1901 we come to the fourth<br />\nsuccessive season that the University turned<br />\nout a highly creditable lacrosse team. Under<br />\nCaptain Edward Tyler, Jr., we had the<br />\nlightest aggregation that ever represented the<br />\n\"Black and the Blue,\"and the attack was often<br />\nreferred to as Hopkins \"flying attack,\" or<br />\nthe \"mosquito fleet.\"<br />\nThe team certainly reached its high-water<br />\nmark, although early in the season, at the<br />\ntime of its Crescent game, which it defeated<br />\non their home grounds in a pouring rain<br />\nby the score of 3 to 1. The first time that<br />\nthe \"new moon men\" had been beaten by a<br />\ncollege team in eleven years. The explanation of this feat is simply this: That it was a<br />\nwet day, Crescents did not have their best team<br />\nout, Hopkins was in perfect physical condition<br />\nand ran them off their feet, at the same time<br />\nplaying faultless lacrosse.<br />\nBefore the Crescent game Hopkins had<br />\nbeaten All Baltimore, University of Pennsylvania and afterwards the College of the City<br />\nof New York. Columbia University fell before our light attack before we met Harvard.<br />\nThe day for the Harvard game\u2014Monday<br />\nbefore the Swarthmore one\u2014was ideal, and<br />\nour manager, Harry Byrne, had been very<br />\ndiligent in seeing that it was properly advertised, with the result that about fifteen hundred people journeyed out to the then called<br />\nAmerican League Park to see the contest.<br />\nHarvard's strength was a surprise; they had<br />\na large team on which were several Canadians,<br />\nand moreover, not only had they been coached<br />\nin the Hopkins style of play, but they also<br />\nhad Clarence Guggenheimer, who was at<br />\nthat time attending the Harvaid Law School,<br />\nbetween the posts. Hopkins won out in a<br />\nclose game by the score of 4 to 0. Most of<br />\nthe light attack, which averaged only 128<br />\npounds, was so used up that they did not recuperate in time for the Swarthmore game.<br />\nThe most noticeable playing up to now had<br />\nbeen that of Bertram Bernheini at out home,<br /><br />\nand B. Swayne Putts at in home. In this<br />\ntheir first year together they were developing<br />\na team play which made them the following<br />\nyear the best pair in front of goal that Hopkins<br />\nhas had to this day. Bernheim was a good,<br />\nhard shot, whereas Putts was a wonder at rebounds and placing quick shots when in<br />\nclose. \u2022<br />\nNext we come to the fatal Swarthmore<br />\ngame, when our boys were beaten by superior<br />\nphysical condition and fine goal-keeping on<br />\nthe part of Downing, Swathmore's goal-man.<br />\nThe first half ended in a tie, the score being<br />\n2-2; the second half was a terrific one and the<br />\n\"Black and the Blue\" had to give up first<br />\nplace, losing by she score of 4-2; her first<br />\ncollege game in four years.<br />\nSome who read this historical sketch will<br />\nwonder why no mention is made of our old<br />\nintercollegiate friends and opponents, Lehigh<br />\nand Stevens. The truth of the matter is,<br />\nthat after the rough game played with Stevens<br />\nin 1900, Hopkins refused to remain in the<br />\nleague as long as the Hoboken boys were in the<br />\nsame and withdrew from it. These differences were patched up before many seasons<br />\nand today all are good friends again.<br />\nEd. Tylers' team with the scores of game is<br />\ngiven below:<br />\nJohn Straith Briscoe, Charles F. Ranft,<br />\ngoal; William C. Schmeisser, point; James<br />\nE. Tyler, Jr., William H.

The efforts of the coaches<br />\nwere directed more than ever, heretofore, towards team-work; and the lacrosse season<br />\nfound Johns Hopkins represented on the field<br />\nby what may be termed a moderately heavy<br />\nteam. Its stick-work was fast and in teamwork it excelled anything that has ever<br />\nrepresented the \"Black and the Blue.\" The<br />\nteam was uniform throughout and each<br />\nplayer did his part, making it thus of little<br />\navail for an opponent to try to keep a \"star\"<br />\nplayer out of the game. If one man was too<br />\nclosely pressed the others could get along<br />\nwithout him.<br />\nAfter playing a practice game with an All<br />\nBaltimore team, the University .opened its<br />\nregular season on Franklin Field with the<br />\nUniversity of Pennsylvania, defeating the<br />\nsame by a score of 5 to 1. A week later<br />\nHobart was also defeated,\u2014score 12 to 1.<br />\nAfter playing a practice game with an All<br />\nBaltimore team, the University opened its<br />\nregular season on Franklin Field with the<br />\nUniversity of Pennsylvania, defeating the<br />\nsame by a score of 5 to 1. A week later<br />\nHobart was also defeated. Score, 12 to 1.<br />\nNext came the annual game with Harvard.<br />\nIt was in this game, which was played in<br />\nBaltimore on the 19th of April, that the Hopkins team really first began to find itself.<br />\nAmid the applause of sixteen spectators, fair<br />\nHarvard was defeated to the tune of 11 to 1,<br />\nthe score hardly indicating the nature of the<br />\ngame. After this, Lehigh and Columbia<br />\nwere also forced to clear the way; for Hopkins<br />\nwas after the championship honors that she<br />\nhad lost the year before. In 1902, like in<br />\n1901, the final clash was between two teams,<br />\nneither of which had lost a college game<br />\nduring the entire season; it was Swarthmore<br />\nagainst Hopkins, champions against ex-champions.<br />\nBefore I give the details of this game, I<br />\nmust repeat, for those who have not heard it,<br />\nthe now old \"pistol story\" :<br />\nOn the Fridayl afternoon when the writer<br /><br />\n9<br /><br />\nwalked out on the platform of the Mt. Royal<br />\nStation, preparatory to escorting the team to<br />\nSouth Bethlehem, he suddenly caught sight<br />\nof a pistol barrel as it was quietly and unostentatiously bestowed in the deep recesses of a<br />\ndress-suit case. He only thought to himself,<br />\n\"Ah, this looks like a trip to Allentown after<br />\nthe game.\" Just then the train pulled in and<br />\nthis incident was forgotten in the rush of other<br />\nmatters. A rough reminder came, however,<br />\nthe following evening at 10.30 P. M., when<br />\nyours truly after lie had, as he thought, tucked<br />\nall of his charges safely away in bed, was<br />\nsitting peacefully in the hotel lobby waiting<br />\nfor two of the men who were expected on a<br />\nlate train, they having been detained at the<br />\nmedical school. Suddenly hurried footsteps<br />\nwere heard as a bell-boy rushed down the<br />\nsteps, and with palid countenance asked me<br />\nwhether I was manager of the Hopkins team,<br />\nadding that something terrible had happened.<br />\nBefore I could inform him that I was not<br />\nthe party wanted, my mind's eyes rested on<br />\nthat pistol, and I rushed to the third floor,<br />\nalmost getting there before I had started.<br />\nThis is what I saw as I looked down the long<br />\ncorridor: The manager of the hotel was<br />\nwalking up and down, wildly waving his<br />\narms and calling, \"get the police!\" while at<br />\neach door along that hallway appeared fantastic figures dressed, some in pajamas, and others<br />\nin the costumes that Shakespeare's ghosts generally wore. My first question was, \"What<br />\nis the matter here?\" to which the manager<br />\nreplied, \"A pistol has been shot off in number<br />\n325, and the door is locked, and\" \u2014 \u2014<br />\nThe manager was here interruped by a long,<br />\nlank individual, who had ventured out into<br />\nthe hall with his bath robe on, who, trembling<br />\nall, over said: \"Yes, my room is nearly opposite; I was just going to bed when I heard<br />\nquarrelling out in the hall, and, as I opened<br />\nthe door of my room to see what was the<br />\nmatter, I heard this dialogue: 'Yes, you<br />\nwill!' 'No, I won't!' 'Take this, then,' and<br /><br />\nci Hopkins<br /><br />\nmen have long been pleased with the<br />\nexcellence of the furnishings to be found in the<br />\nMen's Store at ::<br /><br />\nHUTZLER 1311TliE15<br />\n210-218 NORTH HOWARD ST.<br /><br />\n10<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br /><br />\nwith this an arm came out of number 325, and<br />\nI saw a pistol flash, followed by the exclamation, 'My God, I'm shot!' Then th door was<br />\nquickly closed and locked.\" After this recitation of horrors, another of the party who<br />\nwas crowding around showed us what he<br />\nthought was the place where the bullet had<br />\nlodged in the floor.<br />\nKnowing who had been assigned to room<br />\nnumber 325, and to the one opposite, and<br />\nseeing that none of our well-trained team even<br />\nstuck their heads out of the doors, it did not<br />\ntake the writer long to figure out that he was<br />\n\"up against\" a practical joke, which had<br />\nbeen such a success, that unless something<br />\nwas quickly done, some of our men would in<br />\nall probability be resting peacefully in the<br />\npolice headquarters when the game was to be<br />\ncalled next day.<br />\nA lengthy explanation to the manager and<br />\nthe search of number 325 for firearms, which<br />\nwere not found, did much to appease the<br />\nstout little gentleman, and the incident was<br />\nclosed by a general laugh on the part of the<br />\nmembers of the team, but not by the other'<br />\nguests, who warned their children the next<br />\nday to stay away from 'those dangerous men.\"<br />\nSwarthmore was played in Baltimore at the<br />\nAmerican League Park on May 11th before a<br />\nlarge audience. Lacrosse enthusiasm ran high<br />\nin the Monumentai City when our team, under<br />\nthe leadership of Capt. Schmeisser, once more<br />\nbrought back the championship banner by a<br />\nscore of 8 to 2. Both sides put up a great<br />\ngame, neither side scoring for twenty-five<br />\nminutes, when Palmer Bernheini, our third<br />\nattack,whose team-work with Abercrombie was<br />\none of the features of the game, started the<br />\nball rolling by shooting the first goal.<br />\nAnother goal by us, and good work by<br />\nBriscoe, our goal-tend, and the first half ended<br />\n2 to 1 in favor of Hopkins.<br />\nIn the second half, Hopkins team-work and<br />\nsuperior condition, the same quality which<br />\nhad won the game for Swarthmore the year<br />\nbefore, b?gan to tell; hence the final score.<br />\nHardly had the season ended, with the boys<br />\nout of training, getting ready for their final<br />\nexaminations, when the management received<br />\na challenge from the University of Toronto to<br />\nplay in New York or Baltimore for the Championship of America. The possibility of such<br />\na game was thoroughly discussed; and it was<br /><br />\ndecided that the Baltimore public was ripe for<br />\nsuch a contest. Now, owing to the fact that examination dates conflicted with the Canadians'<br />\nSouthern trip, it was determined to induce<br />\nthem to make a special trip from Toronto and<br />\nand play in Baltimore on the 11th of June, the<br />\nday after the annual Hopkins Commencement.<br />\nThe Canadians accepted, so it became necessary for the Hopkins management to collect<br />\nthe team. Some of the medical students had<br />\nalready left the city; but a trip from Kentucky<br />\nto Baltimore was readily undertaken, so as to<br />\nplace on the field against Toronto the same<br />\nteam which had won from Swarthmore.<br />\nThe men once more went into strict training, and the management did its part to make<br />\nthe event a success. A committee, consisting<br />\nof some of Baltimore's most prominent citizens,<br />\nwaited on President Roosevelt in person, and<br />\ninvited him to be present at the game; but as<br />\nluck would have it, June 11th was also the<br />\nday of the great West Point celebration, and<br />\nthe President's duty was elsewhere than in<br />\nBaltimore. Invitations were also extended to<br />\nthe State and civil authorities.<br />\nThe efforts of the management succceded<br />\nfar beyond expectations, for when the<br />\nToronto team took the field, an applause<br />\nfrom an audience, which nearly filled<br />\nthe stands of the park, greeted the visitors.<br />\nThe local papers estimated the attendance at<br />\nfive thousand.

At four o'clock when Mr. Doyle, of<br />\nthe Crescent Athletic Club, who had come<br />\nover from New York City to referee this<br />\ngame, blew his whistle the greatest athletic<br />\nevent Baltimore had ever seen up to that time,<br />\nwas on.<br />\nThe contest was very interesting. Hopkins<br />\nknew it had only a fighting chance to win,<br />\nwhereas on the other hand the best American<br />\ncollege team was somewhat of an unknown<br />\nproblem for the Toronto men. For some time<br />\nneither team seemed to have the advantage,<br />\nboth sides played the best she knew how. It<br />\nwas not until after fifteen minutes of bard<br />\nplay that Toronto scored the first point of the<br />\ngame. Immediately Hopkins with fine team<br />\nwork, worked the ball d own into t Ii e<br />\nCanadians' territory only to have the ball<br />\nblocked time and time again by the visitors'<br />\nstar goal-man. The Northern boys scored a<br />\nsecond time and then our boys put one in the<br />\nnet<br />\nShortly after this, about four minutes before<br />\nthe end of the first half, Hopkins executed a<br />\nteam play which I doubt has ever been duplicated by any team in the country before or<br />\nafter that day. The ball had been brought to<br />\nthe centre of the field and placed for a faceoff when as tile referee's whistle Abercrombie,<br />\nour center, drew the ball from Wood, the<br />\nToronto's centre, into the stick of Hopkins<br />\nthird attack, who in turn advanced it to the<br />\nnext attack man; and so the ball sped on from<br />\nman to man, in nearly a direct line towards<br />\ngoal, touching the stick of every man on that<br />\nteam.<br />\nThe applause of the spectators gradually increased in volume as the ball advanced so<br />\nswiftly and cleanly until the crowd fairly<br />\nburst into a roar, when our famous Putts, with<br />\nhis characteristic twist, placed it in the net,<br />\nmaking the score a tie, each side having two.<br />\nIn the second half the experience of Toronto<br />\ngot the better of our men. Changing the<br />\nmethod of their attack completely, they gradually worked the ball through the Hopkins<br />\ndefense for several goals.
