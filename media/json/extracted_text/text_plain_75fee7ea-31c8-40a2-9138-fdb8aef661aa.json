The interest in the<br />\ncontest is intense both because of the traditional rivalry between<br />\nthe two institutions and the fact that the state championship is involved.<br />\nThe Hopkins-St. John's games have always been hard fought,<br />\nclosely contested battles, but they have been characterized by good<br />\nsportsmanship.

The St. John's team will come to Baltimore<br />\nsmarting from an unexpected defeat by Mt. St. Mary's and prepared<br />\nto fight to the last ditch to prevent a Hopkins victory.<br />\nCoach Van Orman promises that the team will be in first class<br />\ncondition, and from the showing they have made thus far we know<br />\nthat they will do everything in their power to win. They will meet<br />\nthe best team St. John's has turned out in years, but if every Hopkins man stands behind them they will send the cadets back to Annapolis with lowered colors.<br />\nAt a recent game between Lafayette and the University of Pennsylvania, Lafayette College with a student body of 700 turned out a<br />\ncheering section of nearly 2,000 men. Why can't Hopkins do the<br />\nsame? The undergraduates with their newly uniformed student band<br />\nwill be there in force. We want every alumnus who possibly can to<br />\nbe at Homewood Field next Saturday, to sit in the cheering section<br />\nor as near to it as possible and root for his Alma Mater with all his<br />\nmight.<br />\n\"Come stand together we'll raise a cheer<br />\nAnd wave the Black and Blue.\"<br />\nThe Johns Hopkins Student Council.<br />\nTHE SPIRIT SHOWN AT THE NOON-DAY MEETINGS IS ONLY ONE<br />\nOF THE MANY INDICATIONS THAT THE ST.

Their spirit and everpresent enthusiasm contributed no little to the splendid showing and<br />\ncomparative victory which was scored by Hopkins. Swarthmore was<br />\nfavored by two or three touchdowns and it was because of the encouragement which the attending Hopkins students gave to their<br />\nteam that caused it to come through in such nice shape. Some of the<br />\nboys went on the trains, some in cars and trucks, while at least a<br />\ndozen footed it. This is worth while spirit and we're going to see<br />\nlots more of it tomorrow.<br />\n<br />\nHAT'S OUR IDEA in making CAMELS \u2014 the<br />\nQuality Cigarette.<br />\n<br />\nT<br />\n<br />\nWhy, just buy Camels and look at the package!

The interest in the<br />\ncontest is intense both because of the traditional rivalry between<br />\nthe two institutions and the fact that the state championship is involved.<br />\nThe Hopkins-St. John's games have always been hard fought,<br />\nclosely contested battles, but they have been characterized by good<br />\nsportsmanship. We hope that tomorrow's game will prove no exception to the rule and for that reason wish to call the attention of our<br />\nreaders to Mr. Ellicott's letter criticising the conduct of the cheering<br />\nsection, which appears in the Mail-Bag of this issue.<br />\nWe are going to win and our victory should not be marred by<br />\npoor sportsmanship.

The St. John's team will come to Baltimore<br />\nsmarting from an unexpected defeat by Mt.

They will meet<br />\nthe best team St. John's has turned out in years, but if every Hopkins man stands behind them they will send the cadets back to Annapolis with lowered colors.<br />\nAt a recent game between Lafayette and the University of Pennsylvania, Lafayette College with a student body of 700 turned out a<br />\ncheering section of nearly 2,000 men. Why can't Hopkins do the<br />\nsame? The undergraduates with their newly uniformed student band<br />\nwill be there in force. We want every alumnus who possibly can to<br />\nbe at Homewood Field next Saturday, to sit in the cheering section<br />\nor as near to it as possible and root for his Alma Mater with all his<br />\nmight.<br />\n\"Come stand together we'll raise a cheer<br />\nAnd wave the Black and Blue.\"<br />\nThe Johns Hopkins Student Council.<br />\nTHE SPIRIT SHOWN AT THE NOON-DAY MEETINGS IS ONLY ONE<br />\nOF THE MANY INDICATIONS THAT THE ST.

Their spirit and everpresent enthusiasm contributed no little to the splendid showing and<br />\ncomparative victory which was scored by Hopkins. Swarthmore was<br />\nfavored by two or three touchdowns and it was because of the encouragement which the attending Hopkins students gave to their<br />\nteam that caused it to come through in such nice shape. Some of the<br />\nboys went on the trains, some in cars and trucks, while at least a<br />\ndozen footed it. This is worth while spirit and we're going to see<br />\nlots more of it tomorrow.<br /><br />\nHAT'S OUR IDEA in making CAMELS \u2014 the<br />\nQuality Cigarette.<br /><br />\nT<br /><br />\nWhy, just buy Camels and look at the package!
