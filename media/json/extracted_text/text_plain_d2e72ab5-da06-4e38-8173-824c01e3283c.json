TURNER<br />\nFrHE University has suffered a great loss through the passing of Dr.<br />\n\u00b1 Edward Raymond Turner, professor of European history. Dr.<br />\nTurner's authoritative works on all phases of European history from<br />\n1450 to the present day won for him world-wide recognition and so<br />\nreflected honor upon the institution with which he was connected.<br />\nDr. Turner's death holds a peculiar significance to the undergraduate at Hopkins, for it was the unanimous opinion of the student<br />\nbody that he was the best lecturer in the college. We use the word<br />\nunanimously\" in its literal sense, for we have never heard of anyone<br />\ndisagreeing with this view. Dr. Turner combined all the essential<br />\nqualities of a brilliant speaker. First and foremost, he made his audience interested in his topic. Through the medium of his expression<br />\none saw men and events moving as if in real life; one was eager to<br />\nlearn the outcome of the great events which were unfolded before him.<br />\nIn addition Dr. Turner made his students appreciate the importance of<br />\neven the most seemingly insignificant and recondite details. Such was<br />\nthe continuity of Dr. Turner's story of history that his students felt<br />\nthat the life of the twentieth century is a direct result of the happenings in distant throne-rooms of the past. He caused his students to<br />\nfeel that each one as an individual was leading a life made possible only<br />\nthrough a definite sequence of events, leading back into long-gone<br />\nyears. This feeling of \"personal relationship with history,\" if we<br />\nmay so designate it, was caused partially by the stress which Dr. Turner<br />\nput upon non-political history, but its real cause was the intense earnestness, the vision, the vitality of the lecturer. Dr. Turner did not appear to his students as a man who merely studied history; he seemed to<br />\nlive it. The intense love of the historical flowed from the professor to<br />\nthe student. Many men know their subject; a very small minority are<br />\nable to teach it; a very few can interest their students in it. Dr.<br />\nTurner was a member of all three classes.<br />\n<br />\nAMBITION<br />\nT<br />\n<br />\nAST Saturday the Triangle Club of Princeton University paid its<br />\nannual visit to Baltimore, producing \"The Golden Dog\" at the<br />\nLyric. This musical comedy of old Quebec was written, produced, and<br />\nacted by undergraduates with one exception of a faculty coach. The<br />\nproduction was particularly interesting to college men as an example<br />\nof the excellence of undergraduate activities.<br />\nWe are far too prone at Hopkins to judge the merit of each extracurricular activity solely in comparison to what has been done in previous years. When we say that \"this is a good Hullabaloo,\" or \"a<br />\ngood NEWS-LETTER\" we mean that the publication is good as compared with the issues of the past few years. We neglect the fact that<br />\nthere is room for great improvement over anything that has been done<br />\nin the past.<br />\nThe Barnstormers have certainly not deteriorated in the past few<br />\nyears. Their productions are still very enjoyable, they continue to maintain their high place in student activities. But an exhibition such as<br />\nthe Triangle Club gave serves to point out the fact that much greater<br />\nthings could be done with the aid of a little ambition and a great deal<br />\nof hard work. Of course, no one expects a college of 800 students to<br />\nwatch the production of a college such as Princeton, but the attempt<br />\ncould be made.<br />\nWe firmly believe that should the Barnstormers attempt a production<br />\nsuch as \"The Golden Dog\" that it would prove a failure. But the<br />\nnext attempt would not be so bad, the succeeding ones a little better,<br />\nand in the space of a few years we should see the Barnstormers producing plays that are far superior to those of today.<br />\nThe difficulty lies in making the start. Each man when he becomes<br />\nhead of an activity is determined that his charge shall not be<br />\ndebased during his term of office. And so he shies at any substantial innovations. Certainly he cannot be blamed for his conservatism;<br />\nhe is interested in the future of his activity, but his primary objective<br />\nlies in maintaining the excellence of that activity which he is still actively connected with it. So there is grave doubt that we shall ever have a<br />\nBarnstormers Club composed of members who are willing to risk a<br />\nbad production solely for the future advancement of the activity. Nor<br />\ndo these remarks apply solely to the Barnstormers. They may be applied equally as well to every activity at Homewood with the exception<br />\nof the lacrosse team. The lacrosse team aims at the highest perch and<br />\nit is the only undergraduate activity at Hopkins that does so.<br />\n<br />\nWood, f<br />\nGilbert, f.<br />\nGunnett, c...<br />\nStraugh, g<br />\nKelly, g<br />\n<br />\n2<br />\n1<br />\n1<br />\n1<br />\n0<br />\n<br />\n1-1<br />\n2-5<br />\n0-0<br />\n0-0<br />\n0-0<br />\n<br />\n5<br />\n4<br />\n9<br />\n<br />\n11<br />\n6<br />\n4<br />\n7<br />\n2<br />\n<br />\n2-11<br />\n<br />\n30<br />\n<br />\n14<br />\n<br />\nSTETSON CLOTHES<br />\n<br />\nPHONE:<br />\n<br />\nfor<br />\n<br />\nWERGLEY'S<br />\n<br />\nCollege c5rCen<br />\n<br />\n2438 Charles St., North<br />\n<br />\nLa Patisserie<br />\nSANDWICHES PAR EXCELLENCE<br />\n<br />\nOur Business is to Improve<br />\nYour Appearance<br />\nThis Ad might fool you, but<br />\nthere is no deception about<br />\nthe inexpensive service of the<br />\n<br />\nNationally<br />\n<br />\nJustly<br />\n<br />\nKnown<br />\n<br />\nFamous<br />\n<br />\nMaster Cleaners & Tailors<br />\nSuits cleaned and pressed $1.00<br />\nPressing, 35c<br />\nHats cleaned and blocked, 75c<br />\n3204 Greenmount Avenue<br />\nPhone: Homewood 8453<br />\n<br />\nMADE FOR YOU<br />\n<br />\nFOUR NORTH HOWARD STREET<br />\n<br />\n0<br />\n<br />\n5<br />\n3-6<br />\nCALVERT HALL<br />\nF<br />\nG<br />\n5<br />\n1-1<br />\nShelly, f.<br />\n3<br />\n0-4<br />\nBrooks, f<br />\nPrucha, c<br />\n0-3<br />\n1-3<br />\nBrockmeyer, g..... 3<br />\n0-0<br />\n1<br />\nMahoney, g<br />\n<br />\nScore by halves:<br />\nCalvert Hall<br />\nJunior Varsity<br />\n<br />\n(2-3-4 or 5 MAY RIDE FOR<br />\nTHE PRICE OF ONE)<br />\n<br />\nVernon 1212<br />\n<br />\nJunior Varsity Loses<br />\n<br />\nIn a game preliminary to the<br />\nJay-American University tilt, Calvert Hall High defeated the Hopkins Junior Varsity 30 to 13.

TURNER<br />\nFrHE University has suffered a great loss through the passing of Dr.<br />\n\u00b1 Edward Raymond Turner, professor of European history. Dr.<br />\nTurner's authoritative works on all phases of European history from<br />\n1450 to the present day won for him world-wide recognition and so<br />\nreflected honor upon the institution with which he was connected.<br />\nDr. Turner's death holds a peculiar significance to the undergraduate at Hopkins, for it was the unanimous opinion of the student<br />\nbody that he was the best lecturer in the college. We use the word<br />\nunanimously\" in its literal sense, for we have never heard of anyone<br />\ndisagreeing with this view. Dr. Turner combined all the essential<br />\nqualities of a brilliant speaker. First and foremost, he made his audience interested in his topic. Through the medium of his expression<br />\none saw men and events moving as if in real life; one was eager to<br />\nlearn the outcome of the great events which were unfolded before him.<br />\nIn addition Dr. Turner made his students appreciate the importance of<br />\neven the most seemingly insignificant and recondite details. Such was<br />\nthe continuity of Dr. Turner's story of history that his students felt<br />\nthat the life of the twentieth century is a direct result of the happenings in distant throne-rooms of the past. He caused his students to<br />\nfeel that each one as an individual was leading a life made possible only<br />\nthrough a definite sequence of events, leading back into long-gone<br />\nyears. This feeling of \"personal relationship with history,\" if we<br />\nmay so designate it, was caused partially by the stress which Dr. Turner<br />\nput upon non-political history, but its real cause was the intense earnestness, the vision, the vitality of the lecturer. Dr. Turner did not appear to his students as a man who merely studied history; he seemed to<br />\nlive it. The intense love of the historical flowed from the professor to<br />\nthe student. Many men know their subject; a very small minority are<br />\nable to teach it; a very few can interest their students in it. Dr.<br />\nTurner was a member of all three classes.<br /><br />\nAMBITION<br />\nT<br /><br />\nAST Saturday the Triangle Club of Princeton University paid its<br />\nannual visit to Baltimore, producing \"The Golden Dog\" at the<br />\nLyric. This musical comedy of old Quebec was written, produced, and<br />\nacted by undergraduates with one exception of a faculty coach. The<br />\nproduction was particularly interesting to college men as an example<br />\nof the excellence of undergraduate activities.<br />\nWe are far too prone at Hopkins to judge the merit of each extracurricular activity solely in comparison to what has been done in previous years. When we say that \"this is a good Hullabaloo,\" or \"a<br />\ngood NEWS-LETTER\" we mean that the publication is good as compared with the issues of the past few years. We neglect the fact that<br />\nthere is room for great improvement over anything that has been done<br />\nin the past.<br />\nThe Barnstormers have certainly not deteriorated in the past few<br />\nyears. Their productions are still very enjoyable, they continue to maintain their high place in student activities. But an exhibition such as<br />\nthe Triangle Club gave serves to point out the fact that much greater<br />\nthings could be done with the aid of a little ambition and a great deal<br />\nof hard work. Of course, no one expects a college of 800 students to<br />\nwatch the production of a college such as Princeton, but the attempt<br />\ncould be made.<br />\nWe firmly believe that should the Barnstormers attempt a production<br />\nsuch as \"The Golden Dog\" that it would prove a failure. But the<br />\nnext attempt would not be so bad, the succeeding ones a little better,<br />\nand in the space of a few years we should see the Barnstormers producing plays that are far superior to those of today.<br />\nThe difficulty lies in making the start. Each man when he becomes<br />\nhead of an activity is determined that his charge shall not be<br />\ndebased during his term of office. And so he shies at any substantial innovations. Certainly he cannot be blamed for his conservatism;<br />\nhe is interested in the future of his activity, but his primary objective<br />\nlies in maintaining the excellence of that activity which he is still actively connected with it. So there is grave doubt that we shall ever have a<br />\nBarnstormers Club composed of members who are willing to risk a<br />\nbad production solely for the future advancement of the activity. Nor<br />\ndo these remarks apply solely to the Barnstormers. They may be applied equally as well to every activity at Homewood with the exception<br />\nof the lacrosse team. The lacrosse team aims at the highest perch and<br />\nit is the only undergraduate activity at Hopkins that does so.<br /><br />\nWood, f<br />\nGilbert, f.<br />\nGunnett, c...<br />\nStraugh, g<br />\nKelly, g<br /><br />\n2<br />\n1<br />\n1<br />\n1<br />\n0<br /><br />\n1-1<br />\n2-5<br />\n0-0<br />\n0-0<br />\n0-0<br /><br />\n5<br />\n4<br />\n9<br /><br />\n11<br />\n6<br />\n4<br />\n7<br />\n2<br /><br />\n2-11<br /><br />\n30<br /><br />\n14<br /><br />\nSTETSON CLOTHES<br /><br />\nPHONE:<br /><br />\nfor<br /><br />\nWERGLEY'S<br /><br />\nCollege c5rCen<br /><br />\n2438 Charles St., North<br /><br />\nLa Patisserie<br />\nSANDWICHES PAR EXCELLENCE<br /><br />\nOur Business is to Improve<br />\nYour Appearance<br />\nThis Ad might fool you, but<br />\nthere is no deception about<br />\nthe inexpensive service of the<br /><br />\nNationally<br /><br />\nJustly<br /><br />\nKnown<br /><br />\nFamous<br /><br />\nMaster Cleaners &amp; Tailors<br />\nSuits cleaned and pressed $1.00<br />\nPressing, 35c<br />\nHats cleaned and blocked, 75c<br />\n3204 Greenmount Avenue<br />\nPhone: Homewood 8453<br /><br />\nMADE FOR YOU<br /><br />\nFOUR NORTH HOWARD STREET<br /><br />\n0<br /><br />\n5<br />\n3-6<br />\nCALVERT HALL<br />\nF<br />\nG<br />\n5<br />\n1-1<br />\nShelly, f.<br />\n3<br />\n0-4<br />\nBrooks, f<br />\nPrucha, c<br />\n0-3<br />\n1-3<br />\nBrockmeyer, g..... 3<br />\n0-0<br />\n1<br />\nMahoney, g<br /><br />\nScore by halves:<br />\nCalvert Hall<br />\nJunior Varsity<br /><br />\n(2-3-4 or 5 MAY RIDE FOR<br />\nTHE PRICE OF ONE)<br /><br />\nVernon 1212<br /><br />\nJunior Varsity Loses<br /><br />\nIn a game preliminary to the<br />\nJay-American University tilt, Calvert Hall High defeated the Hopkins Junior Varsity 30 to 13.
