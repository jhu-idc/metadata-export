I<br />\ncan't really foresee that we will be able to<br />\ncreate a viable fine arts group. I think<br />\nwe'll have to continue to rely on the<br />\nMaryland Institute for that.<br />\nHow are new programs chosen; or.<br />\nrather, who is responsible for deciding<br />\nwhich programs will be started?<br />\nThe greatest challenge at the present<br />\ntime is making choices. The Dean makes<br />\nthe choices, but I do that only by picking<br />\nideas from students and fauclty. Ideas<br />\ncome out during conversations. I've been<br />\ngiven credit for getting Barth to come.<br />\nbut it was actually a student who started<br />\nthe process.<br />\nTwo years ago, when the Russian<br />\ndepartment was disbanded, the statement<br />\nwas made that Hopkins' history and<br />\nfinancial situation demanded that it<br />\nshould \"try to do a few things well\"and<br />\nnot try to offer every discipline. Is this<br />\nformula still behind decisions concerned<br />\nwith creating new departments?<br />\nI'm not so simplistic that I would live<br />\nby that easy slogan. I think Hopkins can<br />\ndo some things well and others very well<br />\non a reduced scale. It all depends on the<br />\ncapacity of the people we have. The real<br />\nsecret is going to be talent - not turning<br />\nout factory-made professors for<br />\nfactory-made slots.<br />\nThere has been a lot of discussion<br />\nabout the establishment of a department<br />\nof Comparative Literature.<br />\n-We will have an area of comparative<br />\nliterature in the future which will let us<br />\nhave a number of diverse areas under one<br />\nroof.<br />\n<br />\nIs the re-establishment of a Russian<br />\ndepartment another possibility?<br />\nRussian could be included in the<br />\ncomparative literature grouping.<br />\nOne small thing I'm trying .to do is to<br />\ngive myself enough freedom with defining<br />\nnew departments so that they don't get<br />\ntied down. If a department is sufficiently<br />\nbroadly defined, it can include more and<br />\nbe more flexible.<br />\nHave any of the established literature<br />\ndepartments been opposed to the<br />\ncreation ofa new one?<br />\nThe delicate point at Hopkins is how<br />\none plans. We've had the blessings and<br />\nparticipation of the other departments in<br />\nour planning; the planning has been done<br />\nin conjunction with all the literature<br />\ndepartments on campus. They're quite<br />\nenthusiastic, and their positive response<br />\nto the Comparative Literature program<br />\nand the Writing Seminars was the big<br />\nplus.<br />\nWould a new department be created<br />\nwhich would take. away part of the<br />\ndiscipline of an already established<br />\ndepartment?<br />\ndon 't<br />\n<br />\nW2c.<br />\n<br />\nReturning home, without honor<br />\n<br />\nworld, some Oriental history and<br />\nlanguage.

It's not his fauly, because<br />\nmost finite institutions can not supply it.<br />\nI would like to have some good<br />\nChinese and Russian courses. That's not a<br />\npromise!<br />\nWill the University be able to<br />\nfinancially maintain the small<br />\ndepartments that exist now? Is it<br />\nprepared to do so?<br />\nYes, they are in the budget, and none<br />\nare supported by outside funds. There's<br />\nno reason to fear foundations cutting<br />\nfunds; it's all regular University money.<br />\nThere were some small departments in<br />\nthe sciences which had more in<br />\ngovernment support, Operations<br />\nResearch, for example.<br />\nThe University suffered in the<br />\ninflationary 50's and 60's because we<br />\nwere so small. Today, with students and<br />\nfaculty all over the country beginning to<br />\nsee the disadvantages of mega-universities,<br />\nHopkins is becoming more and more<br />\n,),ii , some mg<br />\n<br />\nask for hut which we '11 have to<br />\n<br />\nthink about sooner or later is the Oriental<br />\n<br />\nwhich is my hope, between the faculty<br />\n<br />\nand students.<br />\n<br />\nOkay, we all came back again,<br />\nYear's, Epiphany and the Feast of the Circumcision. A<br />\nbunch of ex-Presidents died, the war ended and<br />\nabortion was legalized, almost. Nixon signed another<br />\nfour-year, no-cut contract and they started making the<br />\nmovie of Jonathan Livingston Seagull. And all of you<br />\nexpect us to come back from places we'd much rather<br />\nbe and start writing editorials, again. Well, we aren't<br />\ngoing to do it. Instead, we're going to start free<br />\nassociating like crazy, since we have no more idea than<br />\nanyone else what's going on, why it's going on, or<br />\nwhat's likely to go on any time in the near future. You<br />\nwill be glad to know that John Barth did indeed agree<br />\nto come to Hopkins, along with some critic named<br />\nHugh Kenner, thus starting rumors of a lit'ry<br />\nrenaissance at Hopkins.

I read some of them in the<br />\nmagazines on A-level, never feeling that I<br />\nhad to have the book. The $12.50 price<br />\nmade it even less attractive. But for some<br />\nreason. I added the title to a long and<br />\ngreedy Christmas list, and now I want to<br />\npublicly acknowledge my parents'<br />\nshopping skills: I didn't get the car or the<br />\nNikon, and the sweater didn't fit, but the<br />\nbook was excellent.<br />\nQuentin Bell, the author, is the nephew<br />\nof Virginia Woolf; his mother Vanessa<br />\nwas Virginia's sister. This special closeness<br />\nto his subject -- for he is a part of it<br />\nhimself - merges with his own talent to<br />\nproduce a moving, but yet clear,<br />\ndesperiptive volume.<br />\nHis earlier books have been about what<br />\nwe would probably call \"stuffy\"' or \"oki<br />\nfashioned\" topics: Ruskin, On Humali<br />\nFinery, Victorian Artists. And in amny<br />\nways. Virginia Woolf is an old fashioned<br />\nbook: Great care is taken in the text to<br />\ntrace five generations of Virginia<br />\nStephen's ancestors; strong emotions and<br />\nrelationships are very carefully but<br />\ndiscreetly explained; the deepest feelings<br />\nare described with diary entries or letters<br />\ninstead of conjecture; the author's ego<br />\ncan not be seen. Old fashioned things are<br />\nwonderful.<br />\nThe book is divided into two sections.<br />\n\"Virginia Stephen 1882-1912\" and<br />\n\"Virginia Woolf 1912-1941.\" Little<br />\ndoubt is left that Virginia was happier as<br />\nMrs. Woolf than as Miss Stephen.<br />\nVirginia's mother, half-sister, father. and<br />\nolder brother died before her marriage,<br />\nand \"the tragedies of tile Stephen family<br />\nwere enacted with the assistance of a<br />\nchorus composed mainly of female<br />\nfriends and relatives.... Sorrow and<br />\ndespair became a universal theme, almost<br />\na duty....\" Virginia said that some of her<br />\nrelatives \"would have made Eden<br />\nun-inhabitable.\"<br />\nTo this we can contrast Quentin Bell's<br />\njudgment of the bonds between Virginia<br />\nand her husband, Leonard Woolf:<br />\nSeeing the Woolfs together, the<br />\nobserver certainly received a very strong<br />\nimpression ofhappiness and unity in their<br />\nmarriage. Their affection, despite much<br />\nteasing ana some tiffs, was manifest; so<br />\n<br />\ntoo was Virginia's dependence upon<br />\nfourteen years, entered a \"nasty erotic<br />\nLeonard in practical matters.... What was<br />\nskirmish\" with Virginia and Vanessa<br />\nless generally apparent was his need of<br />\nwhen they were quite young. \"There<br />\nher, particularly in moments of \u2022 were fondlings and fumblings in<br />\ndisappointment and pain.<br />\npublic...(but) it would have been hard for<br />\nIt's not inappropriate that today<br />\nhis half-sisters to know at what point to<br />\nweknow Virginia by her husband's name.<br />\ndraw a line, to voice objections, to risk<br />\nno solution at all.\" Virginia tried to help<br />\nevoking a painful and embarrassing<br />\nhim by declaring that she didn't love him,<br />\nsenadal.\" Bell is cautious in measuring the<br />\nand their close, but competitive<br />\neffects of these incidents, but he gently<br />\nHer biographer makes it clear that<br />\nsuggests them as a contributory factor to<br />\nLeonard Woolf was the most powerful of<br />\nVirginia's frigidity. George, \"invulnerably<br />\nthe forces which tried to prevent Virginia<br />\ndense,\" played the part of a big brother<br />\nfrom destroying herself.

We're<br />\nall the happiness of my life to you.\"<br />\ntold of his proposal of marriage to<br />\nOther people's lives have to be<br />\nVirginia, a proposal which he \"saw as a<br />\nconsidered in order to understand<br />\nsolution to the problems of his very<br />\nVirginia's. George Duckworth, a<br />\ncomplicated private life, (but which) was<br />\nhalf-brother and Virginia's senior by<br />\nfriendship was left intact. Bell also talks<br />\n<br />\nfrankly of the flirtations and affairs of his<br />\nparents, of emotional irresponsibility in<br />\nBloomsbury.<br />\nThere are lighter moments. Virginia<br />\nsent Lytton a three line announcement of<br />\nher engagement to Leonard:<br />\nHa! Ha!<br />\nVirginia Stephen<br />\nLeonard Woolf<br />\nBell drily adds, \"One may assume that<br />\n(Lytton) was both amused and<br />\nconfused.\" There was also an excursion<br />\nto the H.M.S. Dreadnought. Virginia, her<br />\nbrother Adrian, and two of his Cambridge<br />\nfriends descended on the battleship<br />\ndressed as members of the Ethiopian<br />\nroyal court. Latin and Greek( were used<br />\ninstead of Swahili or Berber, and the<br />\ngroup received the full diplomatic<br />\ntreatment. A picture of the Lion of<br />\nJudah's court is included in the section of<br />\n, photographs.<br />\n\"She could charm and she could<br />\nterrify,\" Bell writes of his aunt. Some of<br />\nher ferocity was reserved for our own<br />\ncaste, that of students and teachers. To a<br />\nnephew when he became a professor of<br />\nEnglish:<br />\n\"But why teach English? ...All one can do<br />\nis herd books into groups, and then these<br />\nsubmissive young, who are far too<br />\nfrightened and callow to have a bone in<br />\ntheir backs, swallow it down; and tie it<br />\nup... and thus we get English Literature<br />\ninto A, B, C; one, two, three; and lose all<br />\nsense of what it's about.\"<br />\n<br />\nVirginia and Leonard Woolf 1912<br />\n<br />\nUnfortunately,\" her biographer loses<br />\npart of his subject, he loses some sense<br />\n\"of what it's all about.\" Bell writes in his<br />\nforeward that the volume is a purely<br />\nhistorical work; he disclaims any<br />\ninclination for literary_ criticism. This<br />\nseems naive: It's admirable that<br />\nevaluation has been separated from<br />\ndescription, but why separate the work of<br />\na writer from the writer's life? The crucial<br />\npoint was made in a New York Times<br />\ninterview: \"It would be perfectly possible<br />\nfor the totally inexperienced reader to<br />\nfinish this book without having any<br />\ncoherent idea of the nature of the fiction<br />\nWoolf spent so much time writine.\"<br />\nBut I don't think that this means the<br />\nbook is anything less than excellera. I'm<br />\nglad I read it, and now I think it was a<br />\nbook I had to have. Thanks for the gift.<br />\n<br />\na world where every country country can<br />\nshape its own destiny, and only in such a<br />\nworld will ourfreedom be finally secure.\"<br />\nWhether sincerely or insincerely, the<br />\nUnited States has fought in Vietnam in<br />\ndefense of that premise.<br />\nThe hope of political freedom in South<br />\nVietnam, however, has not corresponded<br />\nto the agonizing reality of government in<br />\nthe South. Since 1954, the concept of free<br />\nelections has remained as little more than<br />\na myth to the Vietnamese people. The<br />\nassertion that the Geneva-called<br />\nelections. of 1956 were cancelled for fear<br />\nof a sweeping Vietminh victory has been<br />\nthe call for nationwide elections, in the<br />\n<br />\nAccords, was considered a<br />\nCommunist \"trap,\" both by the South<br />\nVietnamese and by the United States.<br />\nToday, the estimated 100,000 political<br />\nprisoners being held in Vietnam remain as<br />\ngrim reminders of the \"democratic\"<br />\npolicies of the Diem and Thieu regimes.<br />\nIndeed, President Thieu's attitudes<br />\ntoward the present cease-fire underscore<br />\nthe honorless nature of the government,<br />\nwhich the the United States lost so much<br />\nin defending. Since last week, Thieu has<br />\ngiven his police and military forces orders<br />\nto shoot any suspected Viet Cong<br />\n\"agitators\". On the eve of the announced<br />\ncease-fire, in a special Tet lunar New Year<br />\nle ter , Thieu warned the South<br />\nVietnamese people not to trust the<br />\nCommunists. The very fact that<br />\ntomorrow, in Paris, the South Vietnamese<br />\nrepresentatives will sign a separate treaty<br />\nomitting recognition of the \"Provisional<br />\nRevolutionary Government of North<br />\nVietnam ,\" is indicative of South<br />\nVietnam's lack of dedication to the<br />\nfuture of political freedom in Vietnam.<br />\nBut most Americans will exclaim, \"But<br />\nnow we are out and that's what's<br />\nimportant.\" This may be true, but two<br />\ndecades of past history cannot be wiped<br />\nfrom memory. President Nixon may have<br />\nsuccessfully achieved a cease-fire after<br />\nfour years, but at what price? It seems as<br />\nif the terms that have finally been agreed<br />\nupon are not significantly different from<br />\nwhat could have been achieved in '69,<br />\n'70, '71 or '72. It appears that the Thiew<br />\nregime has been the constant stumbling<br />\nblock in America's hopes for peace and<br />\nwill probably be the precipitating factor<br />\nof the future fighting which seems so<br />\nlikely. As a journalist who has just<br />\nrecently returned from Hanoi put it, \"A<br />\nrevolutionary government which has been<br />\nfighting for reunification for twenty years<br />\nis not likely to stop now.\" Consequently,<br />\nthe acclaimed and much delayed peace<br />\ntreaty may serve simply to give each side<br />\ntime to catch their breaths and rekindle<br />\ntheir sagging war efforts. Both Hanoi and<br />\nSaigon appear wary and distrustful of the<br />\npeace.<br />\nSo exit the United States after 13 years<br />\nof helping to defend an idea of political<br />\nfreedom in a country which did not and<br />\napparently does not know the meaning of<br />\nthe term. American forces leave a<br />\ndevastated country with a shakey cease<br />\nfire agreement under the banner of<br />\n\"peace with nonor.\" With a treaty that<br />\napparently does so little, it seems strange<br />\nthat President Nixon can go before the<br />\nAmerican people proclaiming an<br />\n\"honorable peace,\" perhaps even before<br />\nthe last American has died in Southeast<br />\nAsia.<br />\nGeneva<br />\n<br />\n\fpage 8/new's-1etter/jamiry 26,1973<br />\n<br />\nappleanche<br />\nSATURDAY JAN. 27<br />\nSports<br />\nFencing.

Hopkins<br />\nscored 7 more field goals than<br />\nthe Cardinals,, but finished a<br />\npoor second at the charity stripe<br />\nThe Jays converted 16 of 21 while<br />\nCatholic cashed in on 36 of 55,<br />\noutscoring the Jays by 20.<br />\nIn their, next outing, the Blue<br />\nJays ran a mediocre Swarthmore<br />\nteam out of the Athletic Center.<br />\nFreedman, Jews,Spence, and<br />\nGreg DeLong all hit for double<br />\nfigures while Jews and DeLong<br />\ngarnered 17 and 12 rebounds<br />\nrespectively<br />\nThe Little Quakers were no<br />\nmatch for an obviously superior<br />\nHopkins quintet. Guards Rutter<br />\nand Freedman forced many<br />\nturnovers with their harassment.<br />\nCoupled with the strong<br />\nrebounding, Hopkins was able to<br />\nscore an easy victory without<br />\nplaying top notch basketball.<br />\nAfter the Christmas break, the<br />\nteam drove to Florida to<br />\nparticipate in the Eckerd College<br />\nInvitational Tournament. Also<br />\nparticipating in the tournament<br />\nwere Alma College of Michigan<br />\nand King College of Bristol,<br />\nTennessee.<br />\nOn the first eventing, the Blue<br />\nJays faced host Eckerd. Eckerd<br />\nhad been playing regularly since<br />\nlate November and had compiled<br />\na record of 8-1. Conversely,<br />\nHopkins had practiced only twice<br />\nsince the Swarthmore game. The<br />\nJays had not recovered from the<br />\nlong drive either.<br />\nAlthough not the sole cause.<br />\nfor their sloppy play, the trip did<br />\ncontribute to the 95-81 defeat.<br />\nThe key to the Eckerd victory<br />\nwas balance and conditioning. All<br />\nseven of the Eckerd players that<br />\nentered --: the game scored in<br />\ndouble figures. Only Jews (37)<br />\nand Freedman (20) broke that<br />\nbarrier for Hopkin . Jews also<br />\npulled down 20 rebounds. Thes&<br />\ntwo figures broke the existing,<br />\nrecords for the Eckered gym.<br />\nThe superior conditioning of.<br />\nthe Tritons became evident eaily<br />\nin the second half. As the Bluel<br />\nJays tired, they began to foul<br />\nmore. and more. At the end of<br />\nthe contest, three of the five;<br />\nstarters,had fouled out.<br />\n<br />\nIt was much the same story<br />\nthe next evening as the Blue Jays<br />\nbowed to Alma College. The<br />\nScots rolled to a 53-39 half-time<br />\nled by outhustling the weary<br />\nJays. Time after time, Alma<br />\nsimply outran the Blue Jays and<br />\nscored uncontested shots.<br />\nIn the second half, Hopkins<br />\nbegan to close the margin, but<br />\nfouls prevented them from<br />\ngetting any closer than eight. The<br />\nsecond half surge was led by Greg<br />\nDeLong who hit for 14 of his 18<br />\npoints in the second half. Jews<br />\nagain led Hopkins scorers with 20<br />\nwhile LaBerge, Spence, and<br />\nFreedman again scored in double<br />\nfigures.<br />\nFor the tournament, the Blue<br />\nJays finished fourth with Bill<br />\nJews being named to the<br />\nAll-Tournament team (both on<br />\nand off the court). Hopkins was<br />\nthe only visiting team not to fly<br />\nto Florida. The weariness of the<br />\nplayers contributed to the subpar<br />\nperformances at the tournament.<br />\nBut all was not lost in Florida.<br />\nAfter the Eckerd game, the team<br />\n'drove (or flew, depending on<br />\nwho you were driving with)<br />\nacross Alligator Alley, arriving in<br />\nFt. Lauderdale on Sunday<br />\nmorning. Sunday was a day of<br />\nsun and fun on the beach.<br />\nOn Monday, the Jays defeated<br />\na big strong Ft. Lauderdale<br />\noutfit. As usual, Rutter and<br />\nFreedman controlled the flow<br />\nthe the game, allowing the Jays<br />\nto play just hard enough to win.<br />\nSpence, Jews, Freedman,<br />\nDeLong, and LaBerge all hit for<br />\ndouble figures. Spence also had<br />\n10 assists while the big men<br />\ncontrolled the boards.<br />\nAfter traveling back up the<br />\ncoast, the Jays attempted to<br />\nrecuperate from the trip before_<br />\nfacing powerful Widener<br />\n(formerly PMC) in Chester.<br />\nHopkins stuck with the Pioneers<br />\nfor the first ten minutes,but<br />\nscored only four points in the<br />\nremaining time before<br />\nintermission. The 39-20 halftime<br />\nlead proved too much for the<br />\nBlue Jays to overcome as<br />\nWidener coasted to a 74-55 win.<br />\nFreedman and Spence were the<br />\nonly Jays to score in double<br />\nfigures. The Widener game is best<br />\nforgotten.<br />\n<br />\nThe team's next opponent was<br />\nMoravian--a rather easy MAC foe.<br />\nThe outcome was never in doubt<br />\nas the Jays turned it on when<br />\nthey had to but they made it<br />\nlook close. John Rutter, playing<br />\nwith injured knees, was the<br />\nsparkplug while Bill Jews was the<br />\npiston in the machine. Rutter<br />\nfinished with 9 points and 8<br />\nassists while Jews poured in 31<br />\nand Freedman 12. There was no<br />\ndoubt as to which was the<br />\nsuperior team.<br />\nThree days later, Hopkins<br />\ntraveled to Westminster to battle<br />\nold nemesis Western Maryland.<br />\nThe Terrors are especially tough<br />\nplaying in that \"outhouse\" they<br />\ncall a gym, but the Jays were<br />\nready. Playing a scrambling,<br />\nrevc lying team defense, Hopkins<br />\ncorecd turnover after turnover to<br />\ntally annihilate Western<br />\nMat,89-66.<br />\nOn key to the victory was<br />\nmobile substitute Andy \"Oscar\"<br />\nSchreiber who scored several key<br />\nbaskets in the contest, and used<br />\nhis speed and leaping ability to<br />\nout hustle his defender. He<br />\nfinished with 11 points; Jews had<br />\n29, with Freedman, LaBerge, and<br />\nRutter all scoring in double<br />\nfigures.<br />\nAfter playing 10 of their first 11<br />\ncontests on the road, the Blue<br />\nJays returned to the friendly<br />\nconfines of the Athletic Center<br />\nfor a game with theGettysburg\u2022<br />\nBullets. Again the Jays played<br />\njust well enough to<br />\nwin--defeating the taller Bullets<br />\nby a score of 77-72. The victory<br />\nwas sparked by Schreiber and the<br />\ntwo starting guards, Rutter and<br />\nFreedman. Scoring in double<br />\nfigures were Spence (12),<br />\nFreedman (13), and Jews (24).<br />\nJews also grabbed 2 rebounds,<br />\nwhile reserver forward Schreiber<br />\nchipped in eight points.<br />\nBut the best was yet to come.<br />\nLast Saturday Havergord traveled<br />\nto the Athletic Centr to test the<br />\nhigh-flying Jays. They should<br />\nhave stayed in Pennsylvania.<br />\nHopkins exploded for a 109-70<br />\ntriumph. The victory broke the<br />\nschool and gym records for most<br />\npoints scored in a game and was<br />\nalso the largest margin of victory<br />\nby which a Hopkins team had<br />\never defeated an opponent. Each<br />\n<br />\nplayer unselfishly gave the ball<br />\nup to the open man, as the ghing<br />\nthat now counts the most with<br />\nthis team is wins--not individual<br />\nper formances.<br />\nThe team record now stands at<br />\n8-5 (4-1 in MAC play) with 11<br />\ngames remaining (6 in the MAC).<br />\nEasily within reach are team<br />\nrecords for most wins in a season<br />\n<br />\n(11) and best season record (10-7).<br />\nWith a team scoring average of<br />\n83.5 points per game, the Jays<br />\nare led in scoring average by Jews<br />\n(22.7) Freedman (16.4), Spence<br />\n(12), and Delong (9.2).<br />\nCurrently riding a four game<br />\nwinning streak, the Jays battle<br />\ntough Muhlenburg at 8:30 in the<br />\nAthletic- Center tomorrow night.<br />\n<br />\nMighty Jay Swimmers Up Record to 4-2<br />\nBy DAN MYERS<br />\nWednesday night, in a fantastic<br />\nshowing, the Hopkins swimming<br />\nteam was beaten by a powerful<br />\nMaryland team by the small<br />\nmargin of 67-46.<br />\nHopkins won 6 of 10<br />\nswimming events and .finished<br />\nsecond in two diving events. Bill<br />\nMilne set 2 Maryland pool<br />\nrecords and Hopkins school<br />\nrecords in this meet. They came<br />\nin the 200 yard butterfly and the<br />\n200 yard individual medley.<br />\nMark Homing set a Hopkins<br />\nrecord in the 200 yard<br />\nbackstroke. Freshmen, Bob<br />\nSchwenkler and Bob Stoever,<br />\nformer high school'<br />\nAll-Americans, took first places<br />\nin their events, the 50 yard<br />\nfreestyle and the 200 yard breast<br />\nstroke respectively. This meet<br />\n<br />\nrepresents the high point of<br />\nevents in the month of January,<br />\nwhich saw Hopkins compile an<br />\noverall record of 4-2.<br />\nDuring the first week of<br />\nJanuary the team worked out in<br />\nFlorida. After their return to<br />\nBaltimore, the mermen faced<br />\nthree opponents before the<br />\nMaryland meet, beating the<br />\nUniversity of Connecticut and<br />\nDelaware handily and losing only<br />\nto a strong Navy team. Several<br />\noutstanding performances,<br />\nincluding some record-breaking<br />\nones, were turned in by Hopkins<br />\nswimmers in these meets.<br />\nIn the January tenth victory<br />\nover the University of<br />\nConnecticut, diver, Chris<br />\nPazendak gained a school record<br />\nby amassing 206 points in the<br />\nthree meter diving event. The<br />\n<br />\nfinal score was Hopkins 66:<br />\nConnecticut 47.<br />\nOn Tuesday, January 16, Navy<br />\nhanded the Blue Jays a defeat in<br />\nAnnapolis. The score was 71-42.<br />\nOf this result Coach Frank<br />\nComfort said,\"I was well pleased<br />\nwith our performance. Last year<br />\nthey beat us 82-31.\"<br />\nBright spots in this defeat by a<br />\nUniversity Division team<br />\nincluded a pool-record breaking<br />\nshowing by University Division<br />\nAll-American, Bill Milne. Milne<br />\nestablished two such records, one<br />\nin his main event, the 200 yard<br />\nbutterfly and one in the 200 yard<br />\nfreestyle. Bill also led a winning<br />\nmedley relay team which included<br />\nBob Stoever and Bob<br />\nSchwenkler, two promising<br />\nfreshmen.<br />\nIn individual events, Mark<br />\n<br />\nHorning, a sophomore member<br />\nof the winning relay team, broke<br />\nhis own school record in the<br />\nbackstroke. Stoever finished<br />\nsecond in his event, the 200 yard<br />\nbreast stroke, and Schwenkler<br />\ntook second place in the 50 yard<br />\nfreestyle behind a national<br />\nchampion from Navy. Another<br />\nfreshman, Steve Keeble, came in<br />\nthird in the 50 yard freestyle.<br />\nThe Hopkins pool was the site<br />\nof last Saturday's 77-34 victory<br />\nover Delaware. The home team<br />\nwon 10 of 13 events.

But the<br />\npoise of the Blue Jays never<br />\nfaltered as they began to come<br />\nback in the last round.

He may opt for a third<br />\nYear if he chooses to do so.<br />\nSheppard said that he would<br />\nlike to apply some of his time<br />\ninto finding out about the<br />\n\"logical antecedent of the<br />\nAmerican political process, that;<br />\nbeing the English system,\" and<br />\nalso concentrate on \"legislatures<br />\nand why they are not functioning<br />\neffectively.\" He added that he<br />\nwould like to \"be exposed to<br />\nbroad cultural activities and take<br />\nadvantage of the great chance to<br />\ntravel.\"<br />\nAccording to Sheppard,<br />\nincluded among the criteria for<br />\nJudging scholarship candidates<br />\nWere examples of character,<br />\nleadership and physical vigor. He<br />\nindicated he felt the latter has<br />\nbeen slightly deemphasized in the<br />\nPast year. Sheppard, whose<br />\nseveral years at Hopkins has been<br />\ngeared toward academia rather<br />\nthan sports, had considered,<br /><br />\n\"walking in and out of the<br />\ninterview on his hands,\" but<br />\nfigured that, \"somebody had<br />\nprobably done it before.\"<br />\n\"What I took very seriously,\"<br />\nreported Sheppard, \" was the<br />\npart of the will that said that the<br />\nscholarship is designated for men<br />\nwho will develop an esteem for<br />\npublic service.\" He stated that<br /><br />\nthe scholarship will \"lend<br />\nlegitimacy to some of my ideas<br />\nand give the opportunity to<br />\naffect some change.\" Sheppard<br />\nplans a career in political and<br />\nsocial affairs. \"I would not rule<br />\nout running for public office, if it<br />\nwould help,\" he added.<br />\nComplex One<br />\nThe selection process for the<br />\nscholarship was a highly complex<br />\none, Sheppard revealed.

The<br />\nreason for this is that the Writing<br />\nSeminars department is one of the most<br />\nimportant for undergraduates in the<br />\nhumanities and behavioral sciences. It<br />\ninvolves them in the basic communication<br />\naspect of their fields, the command of<br />\nrhetoric.

I tInnk thsi makes a lot<br /><br />\nof sense: We have the strength and<br />\ntradition of the program with us, and<br />\nsome of Hopkin's most famous graduates<br />\n\u2022 have come form it. The department has<br />\nthe attractiveness to pull people in there.<br />\nBarth was quoted in a recent Slur<br />\narticle as describing the Writing Seminars<br />\nas a studio program. He went On to say<br />\nthat he hoped other studio programs, and<br />\nhere he specifically mentioned film, could<br />\nbe started at Hopkins. Is this a realistic<br />\nhope?<br />\nWe should have some (of these<br />\nprograms). If a film program were<br />\nincorporated into the Writing Seminars,<br />\none would also expect to have film<br />\ncriticism on an equla footing with literary<br />\ncriticism. The same would go for drama<br />\ncriticism.<br />\nIt .would be dangerous for me to make<br />\nany sort of guess about the future; but, in<br />\nmy own view and in that of the people<br />\nwho have advised me about new<br />\nprograms. film will be a very important<br />\nfield in the future for universities.<br />\n...Studio art courses are a problem. I<br />\ncan't really foresee that we will be able to<br />\ncreate a viable fine arts group. I think<br />\nwe'll have to continue to rely on the<br />\nMaryland Institute for that.<br />\nHow are new programs chosen; or.<br />\nrather, who is responsible for deciding<br />\nwhich programs will be started?<br />\nThe greatest challenge at the present<br />\ntime is making choices. The Dean makes<br />\nthe choices, but I do that only by picking<br />\nideas from students and fauclty. Ideas<br />\ncome out during conversations. I've been<br />\ngiven credit for getting Barth to come.<br />\nbut it was actually a student who started<br />\nthe process.<br />\nTwo years ago, when the Russian<br />\ndepartment was disbanded, the statement<br />\nwas made that Hopkins' history and<br />\nfinancial situation demanded that it<br />\nshould \"try to do a few things well\"and<br />\nnot try to offer every discipline. Is this<br />\nformula still behind decisions concerned<br />\nwith creating new departments?<br />\nI'm not so simplistic that I would live<br />\nby that easy slogan. I think Hopkins can<br />\ndo some things well and others very well<br />\non a reduced scale. It all depends on the<br />\ncapacity of the people we have. The real<br />\nsecret is going to be talent - not turning<br />\nout factory-made professors for<br />\nfactory-made slots.<br />\nThere has been a lot of discussion<br />\nabout the establishment of a department<br />\nof Comparative Literature.<br />\n-We will have an area of comparative<br />\nliterature in the future which will let us<br />\nhave a number of diverse areas under one<br />\nroof.<br /><br />\nIs the re-establishment of a Russian<br />\ndepartment another possibility?<br />\nRussian could be included in the<br />\ncomparative literature grouping.<br />\nOne small thing I'm trying .to do is to<br />\ngive myself enough freedom with defining<br />\nnew departments so that they don't get<br />\ntied down. If a department is sufficiently<br />\nbroadly defined, it can include more and<br />\nbe more flexible.<br />\nHave any of the established literature<br />\ndepartments been opposed to the<br />\ncreation ofa new one?<br />\nThe delicate point at Hopkins is how<br />\none plans. We've had the blessings and<br />\nparticipation of the other departments in<br />\nour planning; the planning has been done<br />\nin conjunction with all the literature<br />\ndepartments on campus. They're quite<br />\nenthusiastic, and their positive response<br />\nto the Comparative Literature program<br />\nand the Writing Seminars was the big<br />\nplus.<br />\nWould a new department be created<br />\nwhich would take. away part of the<br />\ndiscipline of an already established<br />\ndepartment?<br />\ndon 't<br /><br />\nW2c.<br /><br />\nReturning home, without honor<br /><br />\nworld, some Oriental history and<br />\nlanguage.

That's not a<br />\npromise!<br />\nWill the University be able to<br />\nfinancially maintain the small<br />\ndepartments that exist now?

I read some of them in the<br />\nmagazines on A-level, never feeling that I<br />\nhad to have the book. The $12.50 price<br />\nmade it even less attractive. But for some<br />\nreason. I added the title to a long and<br />\ngreedy Christmas list, and now I want to<br />\npublicly acknowledge my parents'<br />\nshopping skills: I didn't get the car or the<br />\nNikon, and the sweater didn't fit, but the<br />\nbook was excellent.<br />\nQuentin Bell, the author, is the nephew<br />\nof Virginia Woolf; his mother Vanessa<br />\nwas Virginia's sister. This special closeness<br />\nto his subject -- for he is a part of it<br />\nhimself - merges with his own talent to<br />\nproduce a moving, but yet clear,<br />\ndesperiptive volume.<br />\nHis earlier books have been about what<br />\nwe would probably call \"stuffy\"' or \"oki<br />\nfashioned\" topics: Ruskin, On Humali<br />\nFinery, Victorian Artists. And in amny<br />\nways. Virginia Woolf is an old fashioned<br />\nbook: Great care is taken in the text to<br />\ntrace five generations of Virginia<br />\nStephen's ancestors; strong emotions and<br />\nrelationships are very carefully but<br />\ndiscreetly explained; the deepest feelings<br />\nare described with diary entries or letters<br />\ninstead of conjecture; the author's ego<br />\ncan not be seen. Old fashioned things are<br />\nwonderful.<br />\nThe book is divided into two sections.<br />\n\"Virginia Stephen 1882-1912\" and<br />\n\"Virginia Woolf 1912-1941.\" Little<br />\ndoubt is left that Virginia was happier as<br />\nMrs. Woolf than as Miss Stephen.<br />\nVirginia's mother, half-sister, father. and<br />\nolder brother died before her marriage,<br />\nand \"the tragedies of tile Stephen family<br />\nwere enacted with the assistance of a<br />\nchorus composed mainly of female<br />\nfriends and relatives.... Sorrow and<br />\ndespair became a universal theme, almost<br />\na duty....\" Virginia said that some of her<br />\nrelatives \"would have made Eden<br />\nun-inhabitable.\"<br />\nTo this we can contrast Quentin Bell's<br />\njudgment of the bonds between Virginia<br />\nand her husband, Leonard Woolf:<br />\nSeeing the Woolfs together, the<br />\nobserver certainly received a very strong<br />\nimpression ofhappiness and unity in their<br />\nmarriage. Their affection, despite much<br />\nteasing ana some tiffs, was manifest; so<br /><br />\ntoo was Virginia's dependence upon<br />\nfourteen years, entered a \"nasty erotic<br />\nLeonard in practical matters.... What was<br />\nskirmish\" with Virginia and Vanessa<br />\nless generally apparent was his need of<br />\nwhen they were quite young. \"There<br />\nher, particularly in moments of \u2022 were fondlings and fumblings in<br />\ndisappointment and pain.<br />\npublic...(but) it would have been hard for<br />\nIt's not inappropriate that today<br />\nhis half-sisters to know at what point to<br />\nweknow Virginia by her husband's name.<br />\ndraw a line, to voice objections, to risk<br />\nno solution at all.\" Virginia tried to help<br />\nevoking a painful and embarrassing<br />\nhim by declaring that she didn't love him,<br />\nsenadal.\" Bell is cautious in measuring the<br />\nand their close, but competitive<br />\neffects of these incidents, but he gently<br />\nHer biographer makes it clear that<br />\nsuggests them as a contributory factor to<br />\nLeonard Woolf was the most powerful of<br />\nVirginia's frigidity.

George Duckworth, a<br />\ncomplicated private life, (but which) was<br />\nhalf-brother and Virginia's senior by<br />\nfriendship was left intact.

Virginia<br />\nsent Lytton a three line announcement of<br />\nher engagement to Leonard:<br />\nHa! Ha!<br />\nVirginia Stephen<br />\nLeonard Woolf<br />\nBell drily adds, \"One may assume that<br />\n(Lytton) was both amused and<br />\nconfused.\" There was also an excursion<br />\nto the H.M.S. Dreadnought. Virginia, her<br />\nbrother Adrian, and two of his Cambridge<br />\nfriends descended on the battleship<br />\ndressed as members of the Ethiopian<br />\nroyal court.

A picture of the Lion of<br />\nJudah's court is included in the section of<br />\n, photographs.<br />\n\"She could charm and she could<br />\nterrify,\" Bell writes of his aunt. Some of<br />\nher ferocity was reserved for our own<br />\ncaste, that of students and teachers. To a<br />\nnephew when he became a professor of<br />\nEnglish:<br />\n\"But why teach English? ...All one can do<br />\nis herd books into groups, and then these<br />\nsubmissive young, who are far too<br />\nfrightened and callow to have a bone in<br />\ntheir backs, swallow it down; and tie it<br />\nup... and thus we get English Literature<br />\ninto A, B, C; one, two, three; and lose all<br />\nsense of what it's about.\"<br /><br />\nVirginia and Leonard Woolf 1912<br /><br />\nUnfortunately,\" her biographer loses<br />\npart of his subject, he loses some sense<br />\n\"of what it's all about.\" Bell writes in his<br />\nforeward that the volume is a purely<br />\nhistorical work; he disclaims any<br />\ninclination for literary_ criticism. This<br />\nseems naive: It's admirable that<br />\nevaluation has been separated from<br />\ndescription, but why separate the work of<br />\na writer from the writer's life? The crucial<br />\npoint was made in a New York Times<br />\ninterview: \"It would be perfectly possible<br />\nfor the totally inexperienced reader to<br />\nfinish this book without having any<br />\ncoherent idea of the nature of the fiction<br />\nWoolf spent so much time writine.\"<br />\nBut I don't think that this means the<br />\nbook is anything less than excellera. I'm<br />\nglad I read it, and now I think it was a<br />\nbook I had to have. Thanks for the gift.<br /><br />\na world where every country country can<br />\nshape its own destiny, and only in such a<br />\nworld will ourfreedom be finally secure.\"<br />\nWhether sincerely or insincerely, the<br />\nUnited States has fought in Vietnam in<br />\ndefense of that premise.<br />\nThe hope of political freedom in South<br />\nVietnam, however, has not corresponded<br />\nto the agonizing reality of government in<br />\nthe South. Since 1954, the concept of free<br />\nelections has remained as little more than<br />\na myth to the Vietnamese people. The<br />\nassertion that the Geneva-called<br />\nelections. of 1956 were cancelled for fear<br />\nof a sweeping Vietminh victory has been<br />\nthe call for nationwide elections, in the<br /><br />\nAccords, was considered a<br />\nCommunist \"trap,\" both by the South<br />\nVietnamese and by the United States.<br />\nToday, the estimated 100,000 political<br />\nprisoners being held in Vietnam remain as<br />\ngrim reminders of the \"democratic\"<br />\npolicies of the Diem and Thieu regimes.<br />\nIndeed, President Thieu's attitudes<br />\ntoward the present cease-fire underscore<br />\nthe honorless nature of the government,<br />\nwhich the the United States lost so much<br />\nin defending. Since last week, Thieu has<br />\ngiven his police and military forces orders<br />\nto shoot any suspected Viet Cong<br />\n\"agitators\". On the eve of the announced<br />\ncease-fire, in a special Tet lunar New Year<br />\nle ter , Thieu warned the South<br />\nVietnamese people not to trust the<br />\nCommunists. The very fact that<br />\ntomorrow, in Paris, the South Vietnamese<br />\nrepresentatives will sign a separate treaty<br />\nomitting recognition of the \"Provisional<br />\nRevolutionary Government of North<br />\nVietnam ,\" is indicative of South<br />\nVietnam's lack of dedication to the<br />\nfuture of political freedom in Vietnam.<br />\nBut most Americans will exclaim, \"But<br />\nnow we are out and that's what's<br />\nimportant.\" This may be true, but two<br />\ndecades of past history cannot be wiped<br />\nfrom memory. President Nixon may have<br />\nsuccessfully achieved a cease-fire after<br />\nfour years, but at what price? It seems as<br />\nif the terms that have finally been agreed<br />\nupon are not significantly different from<br />\nwhat could have been achieved in '69,<br />\n'70, '71 or '72. It appears that the Thiew<br />\nregime has been the constant stumbling<br />\nblock in America's hopes for peace and<br />\nwill probably be the precipitating factor<br />\nof the future fighting which seems so<br />\nlikely. As a journalist who has just<br />\nrecently returned from Hanoi put it, \"A<br />\nrevolutionary government which has been<br />\nfighting for reunification for twenty years<br />\nis not likely to stop now.\" Consequently,<br />\nthe acclaimed and much delayed peace<br />\ntreaty may serve simply to give each side<br />\ntime to catch their breaths and rekindle<br />\ntheir sagging war efforts. Both Hanoi and<br />\nSaigon appear wary and distrustful of the<br />\npeace.<br />\nSo exit the United States after 13 years<br />\nof helping to defend an idea of political<br />\nfreedom in a country which did not and<br />\napparently does not know the meaning of<br />\nthe term. American forces leave a<br />\ndevastated country with a shakey cease<br />\nfire agreement under the banner of<br />\n\"peace with nonor.\" With a treaty that<br />\napparently does so little, it seems strange<br />\nthat President Nixon can go before the<br />\nAmerican people proclaiming an<br />\n\"honorable peace,\" perhaps even before<br />\nthe last American has died in Southeast<br />\nAsia.<br />\nGeneva<br /><br />\npage 8/new's-1etter/jamiry 26,1973<br /><br />\nappleanche<br />\nSATURDAY JAN. 27<br />\nSports<br />\nFencing.

Hopkins<br />\nscored 7 more field goals than<br />\nthe Cardinals,, but finished a<br />\npoor second at the charity stripe<br />\nThe Jays converted 16 of 21 while<br />\nCatholic cashed in on 36 of 55,<br />\noutscoring the Jays by 20.<br />\nIn their, next outing, the Blue<br />\nJays ran a mediocre Swarthmore<br />\nteam out of the Athletic Center.<br />\nFreedman, Jews,Spence, and<br />\nGreg DeLong all hit for double<br />\nfigures while Jews and DeLong<br />\ngarnered 17 and 12 rebounds<br />\nrespectively<br />\nThe Little Quakers were no<br />\nmatch for an obviously superior<br />\nHopkins quintet. Guards Rutter<br />\nand Freedman forced many<br />\nturnovers with their harassment.<br />\nCoupled with the strong<br />\nrebounding, Hopkins was able to<br />\nscore an easy victory without<br />\nplaying top notch basketball.<br />\nAfter the Christmas break, the<br />\nteam drove to Florida to<br />\nparticipate in the Eckerd College<br />\nInvitational Tournament. Also<br />\nparticipating in the tournament<br />\nwere Alma College of Michigan<br />\nand King College of Bristol,<br />\nTennessee.<br />\nOn the first eventing, the Blue<br />\nJays faced host Eckerd. Eckerd<br />\nhad been playing regularly since<br />\nlate November and had compiled<br />\na record of 8-1. Conversely,<br />\nHopkins had practiced only twice<br />\nsince the Swarthmore game. The<br />\nJays had not recovered from the<br />\nlong drive either.<br />\nAlthough not the sole cause.<br />\nfor their sloppy play, the trip did<br />\ncontribute to the 95-81 defeat.<br />\nThe key to the Eckerd victory<br />\nwas balance and conditioning. All<br />\nseven of the Eckerd players that<br />\nentered --: the game scored in<br />\ndouble figures. Only Jews (37)<br />\nand Freedman (20) broke that<br />\nbarrier for Hopkin . Jews also<br />\npulled down 20 rebounds. Thes&amp;<br />\ntwo figures broke the existing,<br />\nrecords for the Eckered gym.<br />\nThe superior conditioning of.<br />\nthe Tritons became evident eaily<br />\nin the second half. As the Bluel<br />\nJays tired, they began to foul<br />\nmore. and more. At the end of<br />\nthe contest, three of the five;<br />\nstarters,had fouled out.<br /><br />\nIt was much the same story<br />\nthe next evening as the Blue Jays<br />\nbowed to Alma College. The<br />\nScots rolled to a 53-39 half-time<br />\nled by outhustling the weary<br />\nJays. Time after time, Alma<br />\nsimply outran the Blue Jays and<br />\nscored uncontested shots.<br />\nIn the second half, Hopkins<br />\nbegan to close the margin, but<br />\nfouls prevented them from<br />\ngetting any closer than eight. The<br />\nsecond half surge was led by Greg<br />\nDeLong who hit for 14 of his 18<br />\npoints in the second half. Jews<br />\nagain led Hopkins scorers with 20<br />\nwhile LaBerge, Spence, and<br />\nFreedman again scored in double<br />\nfigures.<br />\nFor the tournament, the Blue<br />\nJays finished fourth with Bill<br />\nJews being named to the<br />\nAll-Tournament team (both on<br />\nand off the court). Hopkins was<br />\nthe only visiting team not to fly<br />\nto Florida. The weariness of the<br />\nplayers contributed to the subpar<br />\nperformances at the tournament.<br />\nBut all was not lost in Florida.<br />\nAfter the Eckerd game, the team<br />\n'drove (or flew, depending on<br />\nwho you were driving with)<br />\nacross Alligator Alley, arriving in<br />\nFt. Lauderdale on Sunday<br />\nmorning. Sunday was a day of<br />\nsun and fun on the beach.<br />\nOn Monday, the Jays defeated<br />\na big strong Ft. Lauderdale<br />\noutfit. As usual, Rutter and<br />\nFreedman controlled the flow<br />\nthe the game, allowing the Jays<br />\nto play just hard enough to win.<br />\nSpence, Jews, Freedman,<br />\nDeLong, and LaBerge all hit for<br />\ndouble figures. Spence also had<br />\n10 assists while the big men<br />\ncontrolled the boards.<br />\nAfter traveling back up the<br />\ncoast, the Jays attempted to<br />\nrecuperate from the trip before_<br />\nfacing powerful Widener<br />\n(formerly PMC) in Chester.<br />\nHopkins stuck with the Pioneers<br />\nfor the first ten minutes,but<br />\nscored only four points in the<br />\nremaining time before<br />\nintermission. The 39-20 halftime<br />\nlead proved too much for the<br />\nBlue Jays to overcome as<br />\nWidener coasted to a 74-55 win.<br />\nFreedman and Spence were the<br />\nonly Jays to score in double<br />\nfigures. The Widener game is best<br />\nforgotten.<br /><br />\nThe team's next opponent was<br />\nMoravian--a rather easy MAC foe.<br />\nThe outcome was never in doubt<br />\nas the Jays turned it on when<br />\nthey had to but they made it<br />\nlook close. John Rutter, playing<br />\nwith injured knees, was the<br />\nsparkplug while Bill Jews was the<br />\npiston in the machine.
