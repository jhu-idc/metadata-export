The<br />\nforum will be held<br />\nin Shriver Hall next Frida<br />\ny at 8:00 p.m.<br />\nFrederick DeKuyper, executive assistant to the<br />\nPresident, noted that the panel on Vietnam<br />\nwould be \"timely\" to the Moratorium activit<br />\nies<br />\nnext Thursday and Friday. \"There will<br />\nbe a lot<br />\nof discussion on Vietnam those days,\" DeKuyper stated, \"and we think that the views of this<br />\nPanel will be germaine to the students.\"<br />\nHowever, others close to the administration<br />\nexpressed the belief that Gordon is trying to<br />\nsalvage the wreckage that occurred when the<br />\nadministration over reacted to the October<br />\nMoratorium. At that time three peace action<br />\nleaders were sanctioned from extra-curricular<br />\nactivities for \"disruptive\" activities. The decision<br />\nwas later reversed.<br />\nStill Neutral<br />\nAt a Tuesday luncheon with student leaders<br />\nthis week, President Gordon announced that the<br />\nUniversity's neutral stand on the peace demonstrations will not change, and that professors<br />\nwill again have the option to hold or suspend<br />\nclasses on those days. The number of faculty<br />\n<br />\nwho Will honor the Moratorium suspension next<br />\nweek is still uncertain.<br />\nThe panel discussion next Friday will be open<br />\nto the, public and questions from the audience<br />\nwill be permitted, according to Manuel Rodriguez, the discussion moderator.

A Committee<br />\non Student Conduct was convened last<br />\nyear and at that time preparted a preliminary code, which was sent to President Gordon.

It<br />\nwas an attempt to enlarge the scope of<br />\nthe committee from considering a student conduct code, to a consideration of<br />\na 'university-wide conduct code,' according to Conviser.

The Admissions Office has not yet<br />\nreceived official word or when to start<br />\npublicizing the new decision to other universities and high schools. A few weeks<br />\nago they began keeping the names<br />\nof female transfer students interested in applying to Hopkins.<br />\nDr. Gordon's Tuesday memorandum<br />\nstated in part, \"I am recommending to<br />\nthe Executive Committee<br />\nof the Board<br />\nof Trustees<br />\nat their meeting of November 10 approval of the<br />\nadmission to the<br />\nJunior class of women student transferring from other institutions beginning<br />\nin<br />\nSeptember, 1970.\"<br />\nThis implies that women transfer students will be admitted next year, but<br />\nthe<br />\nfreshman class will remain all-male.<br />\nAll this depends on the availiability of<br />\nhousing for women, adminstrators stated. Last May an ad hoc Committee on<br />\nCoeducation estimated that renovation of<br />\nthe upperclass dormitories would cost<br />\n$300,000 and house 222 women.This preliminary figure now seems too high, the<br />\nPlant manager's office said, because the<br />\ndorms will have to be renovated soon anyway.<br />\nThe students on the six-man Task<br />\n<br />\nDean Swanson, of the Coeducation Task Force: \"I haven't heard ,what our expansion plans are.\"<br />\nForce Committee, Roger Faxon and Martin Vogel, want to see rapid Committee<br />\naction. Vogel, the Vice-President of the<br />\nDSRC, remarked that without a quick response, Hopkins is liable to lose many<br />\nqualified female applicants this year to<br />\nother schools. \"The students are definitely for coeducation,\" Vogel declared, citing the 775 signatured letter that<br />\nwas circulated around the dorms recently asking for \"significant coeducation<br />\nby 1970.\"<br />\n<br />\nMerger Vetoed<br />\nBy RICHARD B. CRAMER<br />\nAs you admire the feminine additions<br />\nto the<br />\ncampus next year, and thank the<br />\nfates that you are part of the \"enlightened\" generation, remember that the<br />\nidea of woman undergraduates at Hopkins stems from the silent, stolid 'fifties.<br />\nThat men and women belong together<br />\nwas known long before you, I or even<br />\nDr. Corwin was born. But the idea that<br />\nthe Homewood campus<br />\nwas a suitable<br />\nPlace to bring them together was seriously discussed beginning in 1953.<br />\nIt was at this point that informal talks<br />\nbetween Hopkins and<br />\nGoucher began, with<br />\nthe idea that the two<br />\nNews-Letter<br />\nschools would do better as one. Dean<br />\nNEWS\u2022<br />\nRhoda<br />\nDorsey of<br />\nGoucher has said that<br />\nANALYSIS<br />\ntalk of merging the<br />\ntwo schools has been<br />\ngoing on for fifteen<br />\nyears.<br />\nLast year, speculation came to a head<br />\nWhen the two schools engaged in a more<br />\nformal discussion of the possibilities.<br />\nDean Dorsey and Dean Carl Swanson<br />\nmet several times to explore the subject.<br />\nThe recommendations of the Academic<br />\nCouncil that Hopkins admit coeds seem<br />\nto have<br />\nsquelched merger plans for the<br />\nindefinite future.<br />\nHopkins rejected the idea of merging<br />\nfor several reasons. Although the excellent facilities of the Goucher campus<br />\nwould eliminate the need for Hopkins to<br />\nadd to or alter its plant to accomodate<br />\nwomen, the problem of shunting students<br />\nbetween the two campuses would have<br />\nProved difficult to overcome.While thoughts about merging were still in vogue,<br />\nPresident Gordon suggested that the<br />\nGoucher campus be used to house and<br />\nteach freshmen and sophomores of both<br />\nsexes. The students would later come<br />\n<br />\nRoger Faxon, a Student Council representative, stated, \"I would like, as a matter of good faith, to allow some girls in<br />\nnext semester on a transfer basis. The<br />\npractical realities are not that great. Reports show that we can go coed immediately if we want to put in the work.\"<br />\nA second major question that must be<br />\nanswered by the Task Force is whether<br />\nwomen students will displace or supplement the male student body. President<br />\nGordon in his memo suggested that the<br />\n<br />\nfuture freshmen classes be increased to<br />\n600, including 150 to 200 women and 400<br />\nto 450 men.<br />\nDean Swanson stated, \"I think that we<br />\nare crowded now\" in response to the<br />\nquestion of increasing the undergraduate<br />\npopulation. \"To increase the student body<br />\nwe must make sure that we can service<br />\nand educate them,' he noted. \"This'<br />\nmeans, of course, more faculty, space<br />\nand courses. At the present time I haven't<br />\nheard what our expansion plans are and if<br />\nwe have the money.\"<br />\nDr. James C. Walker of the Physics<br />\nDepartment and member of the Task<br />\nForce said that he would support\"a small<br />\nincrease in size of the undergraduates.\"<br />\n\"It would be a mistake to decrease the<br />\nnumber of male students here,\" he claimed.<br />\nOther questions Gordon asked the Task<br />\nForce to study are the impact of coeducation on present and potential arrangements for collaboration between Johns<br />\nHopkins and Goucher College, the possible additional requirements for staff in<br />\nthe health and related services and the<br />\nimpact of coeducation on requirements<br />\nfor student financial aid.<br />\nLast May's Committee on Coeducation Report stated that the addition of<br />\nwomen undergraduates would increase<br />\nthe size of the pool of qualified applicants<br />\nfrom which our undergraduate body is<br />\ndrawn, increase the diversity of the courses, especially in the Humanities, and<br />\nwould \"improve the intellectual and<br />\nsocial environment on campus.\"<br />\n\"We wish to make quite clear,\" the<br />\nreport states, \"that we believe Hopkins'<br />\nmission to be the pursuit of intellectual<br />\nexcellence at all levels,not to experiment<br />\nin social living or adjustment. Nevertheless, the real world is bisexual, and we<br />\ncan see no reason why intellectual pursuits cannot be similarly so.\"<br />\n<br />\nPolitics, Pedantry, Prestige<br />\n<br />\nto Homewood for their upperclass years.<br />\nThe problem of merging the two student bodies, however, seemed simple<br />\nwhen placed next to the task of uniting<br />\nthe two faculties. It was the fears of the<br />\nfaculty which prevented the merger plans<br />\nfrom ever becoming reality and which<br />\ndictated that this school accept its own<br />\ncoeds if it wanted women undergraduates.<br />\nFaculty objections to a Goucher-Hopkins merger can be grouped into three<br />\ngeneral categories: political, academic<br />\nand professional. The faculty wields all<br />\nof the political power at Hopkins presently. The unit of government is the<br />\ndepartment, and as any Hopkins administrator will mournfully tell you, the<br />\ndepartments here do precisely what they<br />\nwant (assuming that the funds are there).<br />\nA union of the faculties of the two<br />\nschools would wreak havoc with this<br />\nstrict adherence to the departmental<br />\nsystem as it now exists. Consider that<br />\nGoucher has a faculty in American Studies. Would that department be subsumed<br />\nunder one of Hopkins departments? English? History? Humanities? Or would it<br />\nbe allowed to survive the merge? The<br />\nlast possibility strikes the most terror<br />\ninto the hearts of the faculty.If a department (comprised only of Goucher professors) were admitted into the Hopkins<br />\nfaculty and given equal status with the<br />\nestablished departments<br />\nthe faculty<br />\nwould consider its autonomy, authority<br />\nand importance threatened.<br />\nThe difference and conflicts in departmental structure points out the<br />\nsecond category into which arguments<br />\nagainst merging fell. This is the area of<br />\nacademic concerns. Professors<br />\nat<br />\nGoucher and Hopkins do not always see<br />\neye on exactly how their subjects are to<br />\nbe taught. The Hopkins faculty knew that<br />\nthis would cause problems. Take, for<br />\nexample, the Psychology Departments<br />\nof the two schools.Goucher's department<br />\nis concerned with psychological theory<br />\n<br />\nto a much greater extent than is that of<br />\nHopkins. On paper, it looks as though<br />\nthe fact that the two departments differ<br />\nwould make for one well-rounded department upon consolidation. However, this<br />\ncould not occur.<br />\nHopkins' departments are small.They<br />\ntend<br />\nto specialize in a particular<br />\nacademic or methodological area. If it<br />\nis (as in the case of Psychology) behaviorist, there is very little room or<br />\nwelcome for a psychologist whose acaw elcome for a psychologist whose<br />\nacademic views differ.Similar situations<br />\nwould no doubt occur when dealing with<br />\nthe History departments, Biology departments, etc.<br />\nIn many cases, the fact that the members of the departments disagree over<br />\nacademic matters leads them to downgrade the worth of the other department entirely. Thus, we come to the third<br />\nreason for faculty resistance to a Hopkins-Goucher merge. Last year, when<br />\nrumors that an agreement was imminent<br />\nwere flying, several faculty members<br />\ncontended that the move was unwise because appending Goucher professors onto<br />\nthe Hopkins faculty would lower the standards of tl- faculty.<br />\nThis is simply a matter of academic<br />\nprestige. The argument most frequently<br />\nheard is that without a union of the two<br />\nschools, few of the Goucher faculty would<br />\nbe asked to join the ranks of Hopkins professors. The research done by Goucher<br />\nprofessors (it is claimed) is not up to<br />\nHopkins' high standards. It is a fact that<br />\nthe faculty at Goucher is much more<br />\noriented toward teaching than is the Hopkins faculty. Correspondingly,the amount<br />\nof time devoted and the importance attached to research is not as great. This<br />\nmay well account for the attitude of the<br />\nHopkins faculty.<br />\nThese political, academic and professional objections convinced the faculty<br />\nthat a merger was inadvisable. They<br />\ncertainly would have made it unfeasible.<br />\n<br />\nBy admitting its own women undergraduates, however, Hopkins has lost certain<br />\nadvantages which a merger woilld have<br />\nprovided.<br />\nFirst, in areas where Goucher is<br />\nclearly superior, Hopkins could have<br />\nbenefited greatly from the union. The<br />\ncase of the language departments is most<br />\nobvious. Goucher is superior in most of<br />\nthe languages and dwarfs Hopkins in<br />\nareas such as Slavic languages.<br />\nSecond, Goucher has strong programs<br />\nin areas which Hopkins completely<br />\nignores. The performing and fine arts<br />\nare of interest to many Hopkins students,<br />\nbut they find nothing at their own school.<br />\nHence, we find more than thirty Hopkins<br />\nundergraduates enrolled in courses at<br />\nGoucher.<br />\nIf sufficient energy and funds were<br />\ndiverted into the language departments<br />\nat Hopkins, they could rival and surpass<br />\nthose of Goucher. However, Hopkins will<br />\nnot develop any kind of fine arts program in the near future.<br />\nAgain, this is due to the reaction of<br />\nthe faculty. It is a cardinal rule at Hopkins that if a Ph.D cannot be granted in<br />\nthe subject, it ought not to be taught.<br />\nThe fine arts and the performing arts<br />\nare areas of increasing interest among<br />\nHopkins students, but by their \"semiacademic\" nature, they are excluded<br />\nfrom Hopkins curriculum.<br />\nIf a Hopkins student wants to take<br />\ncourses in the fine arts, he must take<br />\nthem at another school. Goucher provides the necessary courses. In other<br />\nareas where Goucher provide\u2018: opportunities not found at Hopkins, there will<br />\nalso be an increasing number of enrollees<br />\nfrom Hopkins (in languages, perhaps).<br />\nAlthough the recommendations of the<br />\nAcademic Council preclude any possibility of a merger with Goucher, look<br />\nfor increasing cooperation between the<br />\ntwo schools. Hopkins will find that when<br />\nit has enrolled its own women, it will<br />\nneed the assistance of the College much<br />\nmore than it does presently.<br />\n<br />\n\fNEWS\u2014LETTER<br />\n<br />\nPAGE 4<br />\n<br />\nNor. 7, 1969<br />\n<br />\nNixon Speech Aids Moratorium Organizers<br />\n(Continued from page 1)<br />\nJim Cleary, canvassing coordinator<br />\nfor the Hopkins Peace Action Committee, claimed that \"Nixon's the best<br />\nfoil we have.\" \"Canvassing is going<br />\nbeautifully,\" Cleary remarked.

The committee chairman pointed out that Coleman had not taken any sort of leave in<br />\na number of years, and had carried<br />\n\"personally, most of the responsibilities<br />\nfor its successes.\" McClain pointed out, also, that Coleman's leaving necessitates an evaluation<br />\nof the writing seminars in order to determine where it should<br />\nas a<br />\nbe going<br />\nprogram, and to give some direction to<br />\nany successor.<br />\n<br />\nThis would involve a determination<br />\nof the manner of conductingthe seminars<br />\nso that they would prove to be of most<br />\nvalue to the student: whether to conduct<br />\nthe classes as instructional activities<br />\nteaching the students to write, or to<br />\nmove the seminar into the area of creative writing courses.<br />\nAlso involved is a placement of the<br />\nWriting Seminars in relation to University-wide priorities. The consideration<br />\nis purely a financial conern.

The<br />\nmeeting was called to discuss a proposed letter to the administration outlining the academic users' needs for new<br />\nequipment.<br />\nThe bulk of computing at Homewood<br />\nis done on an IBM 7094 located on D level<br />\nin the library. When it was purchased in<br />\n1967, many computing people here<br />\nthought that the data processingproblem<br />\nhad been solved for the indefinite future.<br />\nBut the increasing sophistication of applications, in what has proven to be an<br />\nexplosively expanding field, has forced<br />\nusers to go off campus, for the convenience of remote \"time-sharing\"<br />\navailable from commercial suppliers.<br />\nOther Hopkins institutions have to be<br />\n<br />\ntapped when problems become too big to<br />\nfit in the 94's 32,000 word memory.<br />\nThere are additional losses that are<br />\nmuch harder to measure.

On the other<br />\nhand, the man who needs a better machine<br />\nIn an important investigation could go<br />\nsomewhere that has one. In the words of<br />\nDr. Liebman, \"The present level of<br />\ncomputer facilities at Hopkins will be an<br />\nimportant factor in prospective faculty<br />\ndecisions. It certainly would be something I would consider in a decision to<br />\nleave here.\"<br />\n<br />\nThird Generation Equipment<br />\nThe issue has been brought to ahead,<br />\nhowever, by administrative users rather<br />\nthan academic users. The increasing<br />\ncomplexity of administration recordkeeping demands the facilities that third<br />\ngeneration equipment can make available, such as high speed random access<br />\nfiles and \"spooling,\" the ability to read<br />\ncards or print results while the central<br />\nprocessor (the \"thinking\" part of the<br />\nmachine) busies itself with other things.<br />\n<br />\nThe 94's central processor would<br />\nhave to sit around twiddling its electronic<br />\nthumbs while the printer did its work.<br />\nFortunately, it has a \"slave\"- -an IBM<br />\n1401 that does its reading andwritingfor<br />\nit. But this smaller computer costs about<br />\n4,000 dollars a monthto rent, money better spent on other things.<br />\nOther facilities that third generation<br />\nequipment provide but are not feasable<br />\non the 94 include remote input of data and<br />\nprinting of results, and Multi-programing, the ability to run more than one<br />\nprogram at one time.<br />\nThe Homewood Administrative Users<br />\nGroup (HAUG), a sub-committee of Dr.<br />\nLiebman's group, is in the final stages of<br />\ndrafting a letter to Mr. Robert Kerley<br />\nvice president of the University for administrative affairs, that outlines their<br />\nneeds for a third generation machine. It<br />\nappears that there argument is irrefutable, and that in one way or another they<br />\nwill get the power they are looking for.<br />\nIt is hoped by those concerned with<br />\nacademic computing at Hopkins that a<br />\ndeal can be worked out which will benefit both groups, providing campus wide<br />\nimprovement in service.<br />\n<br />\nDigit computing at Homewood began<br />\nin October 1952<br />\n. with the installation of<br />\na small IBM punched card calculator.

Unfortuneately,<br />\nthe expected use did not materialize, and<br />\nthe machine was operated at a loss until<br />\n1955 when it was closed down. The fact<br />\nthat it did not generate money enough to<br />\nsupport itself created a lasting skepticism on the part of the administration<br />\nwhich permenently capped the development of computing at Homewood.<br />\n<br />\nBudget Too Late<br />\nIt was not until late in 1959 that a<br />\ncomputing budget was established and a<br />\nUniversity programmer hired.

In his remarks he warned of<br />\nthe perilous times facing the world, due<br />\nto two revolutionary changes in the nature<br />\nof the U. S. Soviet nuclear relationship.<br />\nAs the first development he cited the<br />\nvast<br />\ngrowth and refinement in nuclear<br />\ntechnology, and, as the second, the fact<br />\nthat the U.S.S.R. is finally onthe verge of<br />\nreaching true parity with the U.S. in that<br />\nfield.<br />\nAs soon as the U.S. institutes the<br />\nMIRV (Multiple Independently - targeted Re-entry Vehicle) system, and<br />\nas<br />\nsoon as the Soviet Union improves its<br />\nSS9 missile, Rothstein said, each side<br />\nWill have essential first-strike capability.

Costs as the main problem of the<br />\nlibrary. One expensive journal, he stated, has risen 42% over the last year.<br />\nCharles Baughn, an assistant librarian,<br />\nadded that \"the library has been growing in leaps and bounds,\" thus finances<br />\nare a constant headache.<br />\nThe Eisenhower library is spending<br />\n$375,000 or 32% of its present $1,147,790 budget for the purchase of books,<br />\nperiodicals and binding. Berthel noted<br />\nthat such budgetary allocations are normal for most \"good\" libraries.<br />\nThe library has spenimuch of its attention on improving the staff and library<br />\nservices, Berthal stated. However, he<br />\nsaid that new emphasis will be placed<br />\non buying more books and magazines.<br />\n\"It will take us a while to catch up to<br />\nwhere we should be,\" Berthel concluded.<br />\nThe University is now trying to raise<br />\n$10,000,000 in endowement funds for the<br />\nlibrary. However, if the funds cannot be<br />\nobtained as an endowement, the University will try to acquire them in other<br />\nforms according to the chief librarian.<br />\nMr. Berthal also noted that the interest<br />\nfrom the endowment funds will be used<br />\nto purchase books and periodicals, to<br />\nstrenghten the staff, and to start a topical<br />\ncenter of \"more current-type<br />\nbook<br />\nthings.\" But Mr. Berthal warned that<br />\nthis could not be too extensive since the<br />\nlibrary at Hopkins is more geared to<br />\nUniversity curriculum. \"We will never<br />\n<br />\nbe an Enoch Pratt. That's not the business we're in,\" he contended.<br />\nBesides that large amount of money<br />\nneeded for the purchase of books and<br />\nperiodicals, the library also finds itself<br />\nfaced with vandalism. In the past few<br />\nyears, according to Mr. Baughn, \"there<br />\nhas been some vandalism.\" However, Mr.<br />\nBaughn said that the University has been<br />\nlucky this year in that there has been<br />\nlittle incidence of damage. Exit and elevator signs have been taken, Baughn,<br />\nnoted and there has been some writing on<br />\nthe walls. \"I'm surprised that we don't<br />\nhave more than we do,\" said Baughn.<br />\nBaughn said that one important addition<br />\nto the library would be carpeting in the<br />\naisles. \"It's hard to study,\"said Baughn,<br />\n\"when a girl in high heels comes walking<br />\ndown the corridor making noise with each<br />\nstep\". Baughn was hopeful that this could<br />\nbe accomplished this year.<br />\nBaughn was emphatic about having<br />\n\"more communication with the students<br />\nabout what they do and do not want.\" He<br />\nwas pleased with the results of the suggestion box, but felt that there are many<br />\nareas which could be improved if only<br />\nthe librarian knew what the students desired. \"The students don't tell us what<br />\nthey want\", said Baughn, \"We could do<br />\nso much for them.\"<br />\nOne of the best aspects of the library,<br />\nBerthel stated, is its hours. \"I doubt if<br />\nthere is any library that has its entire<br />\ncollection open as many hours per day<br />\nas we are,\" he said. The library once<br />\nclosed at 5:00 p.m.<br />\nBerthal stated that regional cooperative efforts with library pools is the only<br />\nanswer to the needs of the University.<br />\n\"In this way,\" said Berthal, \"one<br />\nschool's needs can be filled by another<br />\nschool.\" Berthal sees Hopkins, Princeton, Maryland, and Pennsylvania, among<br />\nothers, working in a regional effort.<br />\nSo far no firm plans for cooperation have<br />\nbeen formulated.<br />\n<br />\nLibrary officials, announcing that there has been a drop<br />\njust been lucky\" and hopes the trend will continue.<br />\n<br />\nip Vadiso Ave<br />\n<br />\nin vandalism, noted \"we've<br />\nphoto by hoffmann<br />\n<br />\nCM<br />\n<br />\nCHOW<br />\n0<br />\n<br />\nHO<br />\nCN3<br />\n<br />\n,c04<br />\nC<br />\n'00 'CHI<br />\n<br />\nOur product is pharmaceutical<br />\nour business is people<br />\n<br />\n\"PUTNEY SWOPE\"<br />\nThe Truth and Soul Movie<br />\n<br />\nPremiere Wednesday!<br />\nIn tile Aar(of CliarlesVillve\u2014<br />\nTbe<br />\n<br />\nVtapijouge 1235-04301<br />\n<br />\nlig 25th at Charles<br />\n<br />\nIf you work for Syntex you're really in the people<br />\nbusiness.<br />\nOur products are revolutionary drugs and other<br />\npharmacological products created and marketed<br />\nespecially for the public's health and welfare.<br />\nOur scientists developed the first orally-active<br />\nprogestational agent which became a basic ingredient in several of the early oral contraceptives.

These constitute the<br />\nfirst changes since last year's. major<br />\nrevamping.<br />\n<br />\nLukewarm Debate<br />\nThe selection of members for these<br />\ncommittees is an issue that has occupied<br />\nmuch of the time of the Council's last<br />\nfew meetings\u2014both in the actual selection of members and in lukewarm debate<br />\namong council representatives over the<br />\ninequities of the selection procedures.<br />\nUnder the present Constitution, a screening committee submits a slate to the<br />\nCouncil containing twice the number of<br />\nProspective applicants as there are openings on the particular committee. Under<br />\nthe newly conceived proposal,sponsored<br />\nby Bill Canis, the screening committee<br />\nWill instead submit a slate containing an<br />\namount of names equal to the number of<br />\n0Penings on the committee.<br />\nIn effect, this amendment would<br />\ninvest<br />\nscreening committees with the power of<br />\nnot only whittling down a<br />\nlist of applicants,<br />\nbut also with choosing the<br />\nfinalist, pending the approval of the Council.<br />\n<br />\n\"Great Amendment\"<br />\nChuck Fax, one of the Council members who voted in favor of the amendment seemed enthusiastic. \"It's a great<br />\namendment,\" he stated.<br />\n<br />\n\"Until last year Fax continued, the<br />\nPresident hand-picked members of these<br />\ncommittees, and, of course, was open to<br />\ncharges of favoratism. Last year, when<br />\nthe Constitution was modified, we established the screening committees in conjunction with the Council in order to<br />\nchoose members. As it turned out, the<br />\nCouncil is not competent enough to distinguish among qualified candidates those<br />\nwho will be best for the job. What this<br />\namendment does is cut out the needless<br />\naspect of the S.C. selection.<br />\n<br />\ntinuation of discussion of the controversy<br />\nsurrounding Steve Ross. Ross, who had<br />\napplied for a position on the Curriculum<br />\nStudy Committee, was overlooked in the<br />\nscreening committee's recommendations to the Council, because of \"various complications.\" Last week, he appealed to the Council for a reconsideration of his case. The Council tabled any<br />\naction at that time.<br />\nThis week, a motion that would reopen<br />\nSteve Ross's case, and declare the members of the Cirriculum Study Committee<br />\nprovisionary was defeated.<br />\n<br />\n\"We've cleared away any sort of chance<br />\nchoices that might arise. Ideally, the<br />\namendment that was already on the books<br />\nwas good enough, but practically, the<br />\nCouncil isn't qualified.\"<br />\n<br />\nIn other concilaction,John McKransky,<br />\nwas named to succeed Bill Betcher on the<br />\noccasion of the latter's resignation from<br />\none of the junior class's representative<br />\npositions on the Council.<br />\n<br />\nMight not the screening committees<br />\nany kind of committee work involves a<br />\ncertain amount of trust, and knowing<br />\nsome of the people serving on them, and<br />\nknowing of their past experience, I feel<br />\nthat they can do a good job.

This<br />\nconcern is based upon the assumption that<br />\nGoucher will join with other schools<br />\nacross the nation in a trend toward adsexes to previously<br />\nboth<br />\nmitting<br />\n\"unisexual\" institutions.<br />\n<br />\nFollowed JHU's Lead<br />\nOther factors contributed to the belief<br />\nthat a unification betweenthe two schools<br />\nwas in the making. Recently the students<br />\nand faculty of Goucher voted in favor of<br />\nswitching their school's calendar to a<br />\n4-1-4 system that is similar to one adopted by Hopkins last spring. The move by<br />\nGoucher involves far more in rearranging academic accredidation than the<br />\nchange at Hopkins because Goucher will<br />\nnot only have to change dates on its calendar but will also have to switch from a<br />\ntri=mester system to a semester plan.<br />\nThis acceptance of a calendar that<br />\ncould cause so many difficulties, so<br />\nshortly after the change at Hopkins, caused many observers to believe that itwas<br />\na step toward joining with Hopkins on a<br />\nmore formal basis.<br />\nAll of these theories could have been<br />\nrendered irrelevant before the Academic<br />\nCouncil move because of a report of the<br />\nGoucher Committee on the Future of the<br />\nCollege that was released at the start<br />\nof the present academic year. The report<br />\nis opposed to instituting coeducation at<br />\nGoucher, and thus would rule out any<br />\nplans for a merger between the two institutions.<br />\n<br />\nThe committee's report has met sharp<br />\nopposition on the Goucher campus from<br />\nboth faculty and students, but it stands<br />\nfirm as a proposed policy statement for<br />\nthe future of the college. Aspects of the,<br />\nsection concerning coeducation have<br />\ncome under fire from the Goucher New<br />\nUniversity Conference because of its<br />\n\"condescending attitude toward the position of a woman in society.\"<br />\nThe Board of Trustees,thefaculty,the<br />\nadministration, the Alumnae,and the student boyd were each represented by three<br />\nmembers on the committee. One representative from the Alumnae resigned<br />\nfrom the committee and was replaced by<br />\nEvelyn Schroedl, a member of the<br />\nGoucher class of 1962 and also assistant<br />\nregistrar of the college; thus the administration had added a representative<br />\nfrom their own ranks under the guise of<br />\nreplacing an alumna.<br />\n<br />\nA member of the committee claims<br />\nthat one of the administration representatives on the committee abstained<br />\nfrom voting on the section concerning<br />\ncoeducation. The other administration<br />\nmembers, and all of the trustee and<br />\nAlumnae representatives favored maintaining Goucher as an all women's<br />\nschool. Those opposed to the report included two faculty members and all three<br />\nstudents. One faculty member voted with<br />\nthose members of the committee that<br />\nwere appointed by President Perry.<br />\nReport Stands Firm<br />\nThe report presents arguments both<br />\nin favor and against coeducation, and<br />\nrecognizes aspects of college life that<br />\ncould be greatly enhanced by an integrated atmosphere. Although it is opposed to admitting men to the Goucher<br />\nstudent body it does suggest that means<br />\nof greater cooperation between Hopkins<br />\nand Goucher be explored.<br />\nThe committee points out that applications to women's colleges throughout the<br />\nnatio, including Goucher, have both declined in number and in quality. This has<br />\ncaused a severe financial problem for<br />\nGoucher--one that cannot be overlooked,<br />\nclaims the report.<br />\n<br />\nThe report claims that \"coeducation<br />\nis unlikely to offer much help in overcoming admissions problems\" should<br />\nthey get worse in the near future. It also<br />\nstates that a transition to a coeducational<br />\nsystem would be detrimentalfor perhaps<br />\nten to fifteen years because it would be<br />\n\"painful in that the men would not be as<br />\ndiversified as the women and probably<br />\nnot their academic equals.\"<br />\n<br />\nMen Cost More<br />\nTransition to coeducation at Goucher<br />\nwould be \"expensive in that extraordinary scholarship outlays,\" claims the<br />\nreport, \"would doubtless be required to<br />\nattract the best of the men applying.\" No<br />\nexplanation is given as to why any more<br />\nwould have to be allocated to<br />\nmoney<br />\nattract men than is now devoted to getting good female students to attend the<br />\nschool.<br />\n<br />\nAmong the arguments in the report in<br />\nfavor of coeducation is that \"men distinguish themselves from womer by having a greater propensityto debate, question and critically appraise the subject<br />\nmatter of the academic disciplines.\"<br />\nWomen in a unisexual school tend to be<br />\n\"more meticulous in learning subject<br />\nmatter,\" says the report. It goes on to<br />\nexplain that the integration of these two<br />\ntendencies could give the student a<br />\n\"wider academic experience and permit<br />\nher to appreciate the many dimensions<br />\nof scholarly activities.\"<br />\nThe counter-argument to this point of<br />\nview is that the presence of the \"aggressive, questioning approach of male students will inevitably hamper the female<br />\nstudent from eveloping her own critical<br />\nskills.\"<br />\n<br />\nDiversify or Regulate?<br />\n<br />\nThe proponent view of coeducationthat<br />\nis presented in the report states that it<br />\nwill broaden course selections and add<br />\n,diversity in academic interests of the<br />\n\"<br />\nstudent boyd.\" Opponents to this idea<br />\nclaim that \"in light of woman's existing<br />\nand potential role in society, it is essential to have an academic program<br />\ngeared to her particular needs.\"<br />\n<br />\nThis theory is in direct opposition to<br />\nmany precepts set forth by advocates of<br />\nwomen's liberation and has caused a<br />\ngreat deal of criticism to come from the<br />\npredominantly female New University<br />\nConference chapter at Goucher. The<br />\nchapter has taken a stand in favor of<br />\ncoeducation but has not, as yet, released<br />\nany response to the committee's report.<br />\nIndividual members of the NUC have<br />\nclaimed that \"this aspect of the report<br />\nis diametrically opposed to our stands<br />\nand this sort of thinking is exactly what<br />\nwe are fighting against.\"<br />\nThose in favor of coeducation, according to the report, feel that the introduction of men to an all girls campus would<br />\nimprove on academic dialogue outside of<br />\n<br />\nthe classroom situation. The report<br />\nclaims that \"This is not to say that<br />\nthere has not been dialogue, particularly<br />\non college and public policies, but this<br />\ndialogue has been sharply confined in its<br />\nfocus.\" The committee feels that \"coeducational arrangements could broaden<br />\nthis focus.\"<br />\n<br />\nMen Run the Show<br />\nThe final point in opposition to coeducation that is presented in the report is<br />\nthat \"men run things at a coeducational<br />\ncollege and prevent women from taking<br />\ninitiative and responsibilities of which<br />\nthey are capable.\" Although there is<br />\nevidence that this is traditionally true<br />\nthere have recently been instances that<br />\nindicate an increasing degree of participation by women in campus matters<br />\nat coeducational schools.<br />\nAt Harvard, a Radcliffe student was<br />\nrecently placed on the editorial board<br />\nof the daily Crimson.

The<br />\nincident was not exceptional in any respect, neither by the cleverness of<br />\nthe jeers nor by the Senator's reactions, nor by the effect upon the audience. Not even Senator Mansfield's public apologies were exceptional; the<br />\nSenate merely happens to be the scene of more subtle forms of discourtesy.<br />\n.The hecklers can take a certain amount of pride in the fact that Hopkins<br />\ndid manage to make the back page of the Sun because of the disturbance,<br />\nsomething which could conceivably be brought up when discussions<br />\nconcerning Columbia, Harvard and Cornell arise.<br />\nThe trouble with heckling is that it is a dead end. A clever speaker, like<br />\nGeorge Wallace, can embarrass hecklers and win over an audience by<br />\nturning either the rudeness or the actual statements of his opponents against them and to his own advantage. A less imaginative speaker, like Senator<br />\nStennis, can gain the sympathy of the audience merely by playing the<br />\nmartyr. In this case, the Senator received hearty applause from an essential antagonistic audience. All he had to do was to read his prepared<br />\nspeech.<br />\nThe other aspect of heckling is that it is annoying even to those who<br />\ntend to sympathize with the ultimate aims of the hecklers. It is a clear<br />\ninsult to the intelligence and perceptiveness of the listener. The heckler<br />\nmakes the assumption that those around him cannot judge for themselves<br />\nwhat to accept and what to reject in a_ speech. Are we to assume that<br />\nevery statement that was not followed by a cry of \"Bullshit!\" or some<br />\nother comment is true, and fit for our ears?<br />\nIt is quite clear that heckling has increased recently in response to the<br />\nfact that the \"silent majority\" controls the nation and that its leaders<br />\nrefuse to consider other opinions. There has been, however, no indication<br />\nthat heckling has achieved even one of its goals.<br />\n<br />\nSell it again, Dick<br />\nAfter the widespread participation in the October Moratorium activities,<br />\nmany people were reluctant to begin planning for the November two-day<br />\nmoratorium and the subsequent march. The announcement that President<br />\nNixon would make a television address suspended planning and postponed<br />\ndecisions. The hope was that Nixon would announce a major shift in U.S.<br />\npolicy\u2014that the November moratorium would prove unnecessary.<br />\nThe nation waited for the Nixon administration to take action on Viet<br />\nNam for the better part of a year. Nixon has now asked the nation to wait<br />\nlonger.

But those who are dissatisfied with \u2022 the administration's policy will not wait indefinitely. Nixon will find that with each<br />\nmonth he is \"given\" his critics will become stronger and more numerous\u2014<br />\nunless the U.S. is out of Viet Nam.<br />\nThe second appeal was for a self-imposed curb on dissent. Those who<br />\ndemonstrate, according to Nixon, only weaken the U. S. position in<br />\nnegotiations. This argument has been heard many times before. The<br />\nargument is based on the myth that the North Viet Namese would scurry<br />\nback home to their rice paddies if presented with a united front from<br />\nAmerica.<br />\nFinally, Nixon appealed for a free hand in obtaining a peace. Mc has a<br />\ntimetable for troop withdrawals but will not announce it(Remember his<br />\nplan for ending the war which he would not announce during the campaign?) The timetable depends on estimates of battlefield activity and the<br />\nprogress in \"Vietnamizing\" the war. Nixon is the one who will decide<br />\nwhen sufficient \"Vietnamization\" has taken place and when the battle-,<br />\nfield activity has dropped enough to permit more withdrawals. Acting as<br />\nCommander in Chief of the Armed Forces, on the basis of his own estimates, Nixon will be free to do whatever he likes with the troop strength.<br />\nHis position will be analogous to Johnson's after the Gulf of Tonkin<br />\nResolution.<br />\nThese appeals must be denied. Nixon must see in November that time is<br />\nrunning out, that he cannot silence dissent by saying it 'looks bad,' and<br />\nthat his every move will be watched by those who are not willing to give<br />\nhim a blank check. Those who waited for the President's speech before<br />\ncommitting themselves to action should now begin to act; those who hoped to sit back and let Nixon get the U.S. out of Viet Nam had best look to<br />\nother means; and those who are waiting for the North Viet Namese to give<br />\nup the fight and go home-had best not hold their breath.<br />\n<br />\nA PPNCE?<br />\n<br />\nWHAT<br />\nKIMP OF<br />\nSORPOSe<br />\nIS A<br />\n<br />\npascE?<br />\n<br />\nA MG<br />\n<br />\nFRIWEr<br />\nKING?<br />\n<br />\nWELL,IF<br />\n<br />\nVOU06<br />\n1,A1N,<br />\n<br />\nKft,t,(111AT Is (1?<br />\n<br />\nWTA<br />\n<br />\np)(14cE OR A<br />\n<br />\n7A1-1(1k6<br />\nAE3007-<br />\n<br />\nSURPRIS6!<br />\n<br />\n50t4E SORPPISE.<br />\n<br />\nPublishers-Hall Syndicate<br />\n<br />\nM<br />\nRfAt.t.ce<br />\nA FROG,<br />\n<br />\n\"We are moving with all possible speed toward the war's conclusion.\"<br />\n<br />\n\\<br />\n<br />\n\fPAGE 12<br />\n<br />\nNov. 7, 1969<br />\n<br />\nNEWS\u2014LETTER<br />\n<br />\nfeatures<br />\nRecords<br />\n<br />\nrkimulation Provides Stimulation<br />\nThe past few years have seen a fair number of electronic music recordings released but few, if any,which have<br />\nhad mass appeal. Switched-On Bach was a success in<br />\nthe sales department but it probably did not start many<br />\npeople thinking of electronic music as a legitimate form.<br />\nThe problem with electronically produced sounds has<br />\nbeen finding their place in the current musical scene. One<br />\napproach, on which the Bach is a variation, has been to<br />\ncombine the synthetic sounds with some established<br />\nmusical style. The ill-fated \"United States of America<br />\nRock Band\" used electronic sounds for ornamentation<br />\nbut as such they could not successfully brace the group's<br />\ngenerally limp sound.<br />\nThe composers who have looked uponelectronic sounds<br />\nas a new branch of the classical music tradition have<br />\ngenerally been too absorbed in mathematical, random,or<br />\nabsurdist composition to win a large audience. One whose<br />\napproach has been exceptional at times is Henri Pousseur<br />\nwhose \"Trois Visages de Liege,\" written for the Brussel's World's Fair in forty-channel stereo, was released<br />\nin two-channel stereo by Columbia several years ago<br />\n(MS 7051). It is a fine piece of electronic program<br />\nmusic which describes a day in the life of a city. However, the commonplace nature of the subject matter and<br />\n<br />\nthe images it geneates limit its appeal.<br />\nAs it is, someone else has found the right materal for<br />\nthe snythesizer and has done the right things with it. He<br />\nis Douglas Leedy and his album is called The Electric<br />\nZodiac (Capitol ST-368). Leedy is a faculty member of<br />\nthe music staff at UCLA and founder of the tlectronic<br />\nmusic studio there. He has also studied under men like<br />\nLukas Foss and plays horn professionally. He cannot<br />\nbe easily placed in the pop establishment. He has, however, created what could be a successful electronic pop<br />\nalbum.<br />\nFor the recording he used both the Moog and Buchla<br />\nsynthesizers, which are similar, and anOgnob generator,<br />\nwhich is described on the liner notes. The sides are not<br />\nnumbered because in the<br />\nElectric Zodiac \"thereisnobeginningnoendnesidenoeside two.\"<br />\nOne side begins with a heartbeat towhich is gradually<br />\n<br />\nsound itself cracks under the strain and begins to wobble<br />\naimlessly and out of its element from one channel to the<br />\nother. Not until the cries subside does it once again become a gentle undercurrent.<br />\nThe other side begins with a sound like the engines of<br />\na cruising jet heard from inside the plane. Added to this<br />\nis a radar blip that sways back and forth from channel to<br />\nchannel and is unremarkable at first but which changes<br />\nalmost imperceptibly into an hysterical squeak. There<br />\nare more voice-like sounds on this side but they sound<br />\nlike announcements made over a booming public address<br />\nsystem with the difference that the sounds are not words,<br />\njust mechanical noises. The remainder of the side is<br />\ncomposed of a quiet hum which is pierced by a variety<br />\nof widely-spaced loud noises. But at the end of the hum<br />\nis all that is left.<br />\n<br />\nadded various popping sounds. It builds upto an unhinged<br />\nclimax and fades not sounding like an Emmet Till automobile. disappearing over the horizon. A gently fluctuating low-pitched tone takes over and lulls the listener into<br />\na trance-like state. Abruptly the trance is shattered by<br />\na high-pitched cry which is joined by various others until<br />\nfinally there is a whole mad chorus of them. The steady<br />\n<br />\nThese are just ways of describing the sounds and it is<br />\nall highly subjective. But Leedy's creation readily lends<br />\nitself to thought along these or other lines.

The Barnstormers have once again<br />\nproduced a fine play without the talent<br />\nto back it up (remember Murder in the<br />\nCathedral and Rhinocerous?) Not that<br />\nthere were no good performances turned<br />\nIn last Saturday night, there were. But<br />\nthe entire production left me wondering<br />\nwhether the play had ever been rehearsed<br />\nfrom start to finish..<br />\nFor lack of continuity was Saturday<br />\nnight's worst blunder. Some scenes<br />\nworked and others fell hopelessly flat.<br />\nI walked out at the end of the performance with no feeling of having had a play,<br />\nmove through me and create a change.<br />\nThe play is lengthy, and this began to<br />\nbe obvious as more and more moments<br />\nlost their effectiveness. Let me list a<br />\nfew of them for mere perversity's sake:<br />\nThe churchyard scene (1.3) is one which<br />\nis highly important to the play. I had a<br />\nfeeling of Musgrave's power, but not that<br />\nhis men were under it. The sight of Rob<br />\nGoolrick tensing his muscles is not<br />\nenough to make me think of a tortured<br />\nman. I am sorry to say that Mitchell<br />\nFrank as Sparky was not in the least<br />\nconvincing. This was mostly due to his<br />\nlack of stage presence, but his lack of<br />\naccent and emotional shading also contributed. The part of the Mayor should<br />\nbe played by a strong actor with a good<br />\nsense of borgeois ownership, and Jack<br />\nGoodman could not convey that quality to<br />\nthe audience.<br />\n<br />\nGoolrick's Locks<br />\nI could go on, but to what purpose?<br />\nLet me ask some rhetorical questions<br />\nwhich will give you some sense of last<br />\nSaturday night's performance: Why did I<br />\nhave no feeling at all of the forces which<br />\ndrove Sgt. Musgrave? Why did I not feel<br />\nlike a crowd in a marketplace when the<br />\nactors obviously thought I was a crowd<br />\nand started to wave bayonets in my face?<br />\nWhy did I laught when Annie suddenly<br />\ncrying in the stable scene? Why was the<br />\naudience left with that lovely little stage<br />\npicture at the end? What was it for? And<br />\n(this last one is a trifle frivolous): Why<br />\nwasn't Rob Goolrick's hair cut? Fully<br />\nhalf of his dramatic gestures consisted in<br />\nraising his right hand to brush his face<br />\nclear of lovely layered gobs of hair.<br />\nThere are two very overt problems in<br />\nthe script itself, and the way they were<br />\nhandled says a little about the director,<br />\nPaul Hjelmervick, who Was hired by the<br />\n<br />\nBarnstormers for this production. The<br />\nfirst of these problems consists of the<br />\nNorthern English accents which John<br />\nArden wrote into the play. Now, in my<br />\nbook, one does one of two things with<br />\naccents: either one does them all, or<br />\nnone at all(and one hopes to get away with<br />\nit). The result is typically Barnstomer-some characters had accents (Attercliffe, Bludgeon, The Pugnacious Collier,<br />\nThe Parson, and sometimes Mrs.Hitchcock and Sergeant Musgrave); others<br />\ndidn't (the rest of the cast, most notably<br />\nSparky and Walsh). The result was almost laughable.<br />\nThe second problem is that there are<br />\nsongs throughout the play. When I read<br />\nthe script, it seemed clear to me that<br />\nthe songs were an integral part of the<br />\naction, and not inserted a la Brecht, as<br />\nstop-gaps. But by and large the actors<br />\nseemed self-conscious of their a capella<br />\nsinging (as well they might have been-the<br />\nresult was only slightly melodic, and my<br />\nears were offended as John Arden never<br />\nintended them to be); the end result was<br />\n<br />\nthat the actors would slip out and into<br />\ncharacter with the beginnings and ends<br />\nof the songs.<br />\n<br />\nHjelmervick \"The Best\"<br />\nBut on the whole, Hjelmervick's<br />\ndirecting job was well done, when one<br />\nconsiders the complexities of the script<br />\nand the simplicities of his actors. I felt<br />\nthat many of the scenes were perhaps a<br />\nbit overplayed for dramatic highpoints,<br />\nand Mr.Hjelmervick could have held back<br />\non some of the more stagey blockingthat<br />\nhe ocassionally resorted to, but with<br />\nthese two exceptions, he is easily the<br />\nbest director the Barnstormers have had<br />\nworking for them in three years that I<br />\nhave been attending Barnstormer productions.<br />\nAs far as the acting goes, the award<br />\nfor \"most effective\" is divided between<br />\nPhil Wiehe (Bludgeon) and Alan Niedermayer (Pugnacious Collier) who failed to<br />\nremind me that I was viewing an amateur<br />\nproduction. Bruce Robinson,<br />\nEllen<br />\nFraites, Rob Goolrick, and<br />\nDavid<br />\n<br />\nWilliams all turned in creditable performance of Sgt. Musgrave more than a<br />\nproducer's dream.<br />\nDan Sheer, in the title role, lacked<br />\nthe kind of depth which one expects in a<br />\nleading man, and one had no idea of the<br />\ndifferent forces driving Musgrave(this is<br />\nperhaps more a problem of direction<br />\nrather than acting). One also had the distinct impression that, for Sheer,emotion<br />\nequalled volume, and the audience was<br />\ntreated to much of the latter without<br />\nmuch sense of the former (I left with a<br />\nsplitting headache).<br />\nAlan Trumpler again turned out a fine<br />\nset (I have nothing but admiration for<br />\nsomeone who can devise six sets and<br />\nchange them rapidly in the Barn, for<br />\nChrist's sake).I wish more Goucher girls<br />\nwould come out for acting, rather than<br />\nscene-changing. Doug Paul and Stan<br />\nMetelits did an overly dramatic and<br />\nslightly repetitive job of lighting, but this<br />\ncould be excused by a) director's prerogative, and b) working in the Barn.<br />\n<br />\nStuart Wattles<br />\n<br />\nBooks<br />\n<br />\nBarthelme<br />\nDonald Barthelme audaciously thrust<br />\nhimself upon the literary world in 1967<br />\nwith a funny, witty book entitled Snow<br />\nWhite. Snow White was a modern version of the traditional fairy tale, but definitely not a tale about fairies. The book<br />\nhas even made the reading list for one<br />\nof Dr. Macksey's humanities courses<br />\nthis semester. With a high camp style<br />\nand a lcnowingwink to the \"sophisticates\",<br />\nBarthelme managed to somehow get away<br />\nwith a story in which the heroine, Snow<br />\nWhite, was raped/gang banged by the<br />\nseven dwarfs in the midst of her hot<br />\nshower.<br />\n<br />\nEggplant Eats Daley<br />\nPractices, Unnatural<br />\nUnspeakable<br />\nActs (Farrar, Straus and Giroux, New<br />\nYork, 1968) is Barthelme's second book.<br />\nIn effect, the nifty title hides the scruffy<br />\ncollection of fifteen of Barthelme's stories (episodes), most of which appeared<br />\npreviously in the New Yorker and other<br />\nmagazines. Bringing these stories together in one volume does have mercenary<br />\novertones but so be it. The prospect of<br />\nroyalty money in no way influences the<br />\nauthor's poor quality of writing.<br />\n<br />\nBawdy Boredom'<br />\n<br />\nEach episode has some witty catch to<br />\nIt, some gimmick to hold together an<br />\notherwise absurd little narrative which<br />\nthreatens to float away in literary extravaganza. Little things like a would-be<br />\nwriter with an eight foot son who wears<br />\na serape made of transitor radios, all<br />\nturned on and tuned to different stations.<br />\nOr a balloon which when inflated covers<br />\nan entire city. Barthelme might as well<br />\nhave included the eggplant that ate Chicago.<br />\n<br />\nStatic and Flat<br />\nActually, \"The Balloon\" is the best<br />\nof the lot. The author's conclusions (if<br />\nwe want to call them that) strike more<br />\nresonant chords in the reader in this<br />\nstory than in any of the other pieces;<br />\n\"It was suggested that whatwas admired<br />\nabout the balloon was finally this: that it<br />\nwas not limited, or defined;\" and \"As a<br />\nsingle balloon must stand for a lifetime<br />\nof thinking about balloons,so each citizen<br />\nexpressed, in the attitude he chose, a<br />\ncomplex of attitudes.\" The balloonwhich<br />\nusurps the position of the sky carries a<br />\ndeeper, connotative meaning (s).Conclu-<br />\n<br />\nsions may not be the proper word, but at<br />\nleast the episode works.<br />\nThe problem with the other \"slices of<br />\nlife as we don't know them\" is just that:<br />\nthey are absurd and outside any frame of<br />\nreference. There is no respondant feeling from the reader.\"A Few Moments of<br />\nSleeping and Waking\",about a man's continuous interpretation of his girlfriend's<br />\ndreams is a real life situatio, but Barthelme adds nothing to that situation. It<br />\nstands static and therefore the episode<br />\nfalls flat.<br />\nUnspeakable Pracitces, Unnatural Acts<br />\nis light reading. There is little strainon<br />\none's vocabulary if he fashions himself<br />\nas a quatrasyllabic intellectual. But for<br />\nthis reviewer it is light reading because<br />\nthere is nothing substantial in it. The<br />\nbook is a tour de force of camp art,<br />\nwhich is fast falling (by the grace of the<br />\ngreat god Browning) from the literary<br />\nlimelight. Barthelme says it all in the<br />\nopening line of the last story \"See the<br />\nMoon?\": \"I know you think I'm wasting<br />\nmy time.\" You're right, Mr.Barthelme,<br />\nand you're wasting my time too.<br />\n<br />\nMark A msler<br />\n<br />\n\fNov. 7, 1969<br />\n<br />\nPAGE 13<br />\n<br />\nNEWS\u2014LETTER<br />\n<br />\n\"mom Our American Heritage<br />\n<br />\nRadical Right Republicans Reject Parker<br />\nThe careful reader has doubtless<br />\nnoticed that a good deal of the Alton B.<br />\nParker<br />\ncampaign was fashioned to<br />\nwinnow conservative Republicans from<br />\nthe cause of President Roosevelt.

Although<br />\nthe<br />\nDemocrats accepted the Greeley candidacy, dissidents could recall Greeley's<br />\nscathing attacks on the character of their<br />\nparty. In some strongly Democratic<br />\nareas, there was a disappointing turnout<br />\non Election Day.

This is largely true,<br />\nalthough I have oversimplified the argument. However, there was also a class of<br />\nwonderfully disinterested<br />\npoliticans<br />\nwho possessed<br />\nnotable<br />\nintellectual<br />\npower, were quite conscious of<br />\ntheir<br />\nsuperiority, and meant it when they declared they held country above party.<br />\nFrom these men, who generally<br />\ncould<br />\nafford party wrath because of their insources of income, was<br />\ndependent<br />\nmustered the leadership of the Liberal<br />\nRepublicans who opposed Grant.<br />\nThere was Carl Schurz, a German refugee with the marvelous ability towrite<br />\nequally well in two languages.

After Blaine's<br />\nnomination,<br />\nRepublican dissent was<br />\nspearheaded by Schurz and Storey, and<br />\nothers who had generally been sympathetic to the previous bolt of 1872.<br />\nThis time the results were happier.<br />\nCleveland had sufficient stature as areformer to appeal to dissident Republicans, but he lacked Greeley's propensity<br />\nfor alienating Democrats. Moreover,<br />\nBlaine was facing a powerful sentiment<br />\nfor change which had only narrowly been<br />\nwithstood in the two previous Presidential elections. There are myriad complicating factors in the 1884 contest, and<br />\nit may be necessary to emphasize that,<br />\nas in 1872,the party bolt was numerically<br />\n<br />\nsmall. Nevertheless, any Presidential<br />\ncandidate would benefit by receiving as<br />\nmuch support in the opposite party as<br />\ndid Cleveland in 1884.<br />\nIt is necessary to emphasize that the<br />\nsource of these disaffections was nothing<br />\nless than a convictionthatthe Republican<br />\ncandidate was morally objectionable.The<br />\nRepublicans did not suffer desertions because of policy disagreements with their<br />\ncandidates, even if these dtsagreements<br />\nwere of major significance. President<br />\nMcKinley's imperialist policy was criticized by several intellectual Republicans, among them Schurz and Storey,and<br />\nalso Dr.Charles William Eliot,the publicist and President of Harvard University.<br />\nIn the campaign of 1900, William Jennings<br />\nBryan strove mightily for the support of<br />\ndissident Republicans as he criticized<br />\nimperialism at great length. However,<br />\nthere was no notable Republican support<br />\nof Bryan.<br />\n<br />\nThe Morals Story<br />\nIn 1904, Parker was handicapped by<br />\nthe fact that President Rocisevelt,though<br />\ncontroversial in certain positions, had<br />\nshown no taint of moral opprobrium.<br />\nThe Democratic press made some desperate efforts to morally impugn Roosebelt. For example, there were suggesCortelyou was<br />\ntions that George<br />\nreceiving campaign funds from corporations in return for a promise not to<br />\nprosecute under anti-trust statutes. This<br />\nwas never convincingly substantiated.<br />\nSchurz and Storey, aging men by now<br />\nconsidered personifications of party irregularity, did greet Parker at campaign<br />\nfunctions, thus implicitly pledging support. But Schurz and Storey were long<br />\nout of the political mainstream,and their<br />\npolitical power was gone. Parker received virtually no support from younger<br />\nRepublicans, who had no reason to see<br />\nParker as morally objectionable. Nor<br />\ndid he have an issue as interesting as<br />\nfree silver, which had caused a few<br />\nagrarian Republicans to rally to the<br />\nDemocrats in 1896. As we shall see, the<br />\nlast significant episode of the Parker<br />\ncampaign was a desperate attempt to<br />\nprove that Roosevelt was in fact corruptible.<br />\n<br />\nEd Mendelsohn<br />\n<br />\nComplete Bachelor<br />\nService<br />\nWAVERLY LAUNDROMAT<br />\n<br />\nMENU<br />\n<br />\nAllegheny Airlines<br />\nhelps you beat<br />\nthe waiting game...<br />\nAnd saves you up to 331/3 To.<br />\nAllegheny's Young Adult Card lets you fly<br />\nwhenever you want to (even holidays)<br />\nand still get advance reservations.<br />\nIf you're between 12 and 22,<br />\nwhat are you waiting for?<br />\nStop by any Allegheny ticket<br />\ncounter and purchase your<br />\nYoung Adult Card.<br />\n<br />\nSUMS<br />\nMANY KINDS<br />\nPIZZA<br />\nKANT KaIDS<br />\nSPAGHETTI<br />\nHOME MAN<br />\nCHICKEN WITH'RENO FRIES<br />\nAND INGUSN MUffIN<br />\n<br />\nThe Very Best<br />\nHARRY LITTLE<br />\nCarry Out Shops<br />\n32nd near Greinunennt<br />\n25th near Gramm/it<br />\n<br />\n330 GREENMOUNTAVF<br />\n467-2123<br />\n<br />\nProgram of Sacred<br />\nMusic And Poetry<br />\nSunday, November 16. 1969<br />\n5:00 P.M.<br />\nUniversity<br />\nBaptist Church<br />\nCharles and Thirty-fourth Streets<br />\n<br />\nHOBELMANN MOTORS<br />\nINC<br />\nAUTHORIZED VOLKSWAGEN DEALER<br />\nDOWNTOWN<br />\nMAY WE SERVE YOU?<br />\nSALES - SERVICE - PARTS - BODY SHOP - USED CARS<br />\nVOLKSWAGEN INSURANCE<br />\nFree Courtesy Bus - Downtown<br />\nSaks Dept.

He took a far more general line<br />\nthan the other two, avoiding the mathematical logic of Brennen's argument, and<br />\nthe military technicality of Rothstein's.<br />\nClaiming that the U.S. and the Soviet<br />\nUnion have had virtual military equality<br />\nfor the past several years, he maintained<br />\n\"nuclear weapons shouldn't even<br />\nbe<br />\ncalled weapons gince they are not appropriate weapons of national policy. They<br />\nare weapons of genocide and suicide.\"<br />\nThe<br />\nthreat of nuclear war is an<br />\nirrational one, he continued, since the<br />\nmethods used bear no relation to<br />\nthe<br />\npolitical realities which call for their<br />\nuse. Using Berlin as an example, he<br />\nnoted that the entire city would be destroyed no matter what the outcome<br />\nof<br />\nthe ensuing war would be.<br />\nMorgenthau also ridiculed the idea of<br />\namassing huge stockpiles on the theory<br />\nthat one must remain ahead of the other<br />\nside. \"It doesn't matter how many stockpiles are left after a war. It is a matter<br />\nfor archaeologists....\"<br />\nMorgenthau, who was at one time Dr.<br />\nRothstein's<br />\nteacher at<br />\nChicago,<br />\ninterspersed his accurate observations<br />\nwith wry commetns. Criticisingthe ABM<br />\non the grounds that a system<br />\nwhich<br />\nscreens out as many as 90% of oncoming<br />\nmissiles and still lets the rest through is<br />\nas useless as no screen at all, he added,<br />\n\"You're remains may be somewhat less<br />\nradioactive....\"<br />\nOn the panelists' second time around,<br />\nthe areas in which they differed narrowed<br />\nappreciably, and points which each was<br />\nadvocating became less clear. Rothstein<br />\nadmitted to Morgenthau that in effect the<br />\nRussians had had equality, as far as U.S.<br />\npolicy was concerned, for the past few<br />\nyears, and Morgenthau agreed that, technically, they were reaching our level of<br />\ndevelopment only now. Brennen admitted<br />\nto both that though McNamara was still<br />\nhis most highly-rated Secretary of De-<br />\n<br />\nDr. Morgenthau and one of his former pupils, Dr. Robert Rothstein,<br />\ndiscuss the implications of world-wide U.S. cold war- involvement.<br />\nfense, he had made many mistakes<br />\nduring his years in Washington.<br />\nRothstein further conceded that Brennen may be right ideally, but that our defense policy continues to be carried on<br />\nspasmodically and reflexively<br />\nrather<br />\nthan politically. He spoofed proponents<br />\nof the ABM on the grounds that theywere<br />\nadvocating the costly construction<br />\nof<br />\nsomething<br />\nwhich the Russians had<br />\nalready found to be non-functional. \"We<br />\nare always promising security on the<br />\nnext level up,\" he maintained.<br />\nBrennen, although repeatedly arguing<br />\nwith Rothstein over specifics, stated that<br />\nhis major dispute was with Morgenthau.<br />\n\"The argument that nucleaf weapons are<br />\ntoo murderous to use rationally does not<br />\nhold historically,\" he claimed, mentioning that similar statements had been<br />\nmade for the long bow, dynamite, poison<br />\ngasses, and aerial bombardment. \"Furthermore, neither side has ten-fold<br />\noverkill. We may have saturation, in<br />\nwhich case, a 10% screen would, as I<br />\nsaid, save 80 million lives.\"<br />\n<br />\nSENIORS<br />\nGRADUATE SCHOOL INTERVIEWS<br />\nMONDAY, NOVEMBER 10 - New York University Law<br />\nSchool<br />\nWEDNESDAY, NOVEMBER 12 - Columbia Business<br />\nSchool<br />\nTHURSDAY, NOVEMBER 13 - University of Maryland<br />\nSchool of Social Work<br />\nFRIDAY, NOVEMBER 14 - Columbia Law School<br />\nWEDNESDAY, NOVEMBER 19 - Dartmouth - Amos<br />\nTuck Business Admstrn.<br />\nTHURSDAY, NOVEMBER 20 - University of Michigan<br />\nBusiness Admstrn.<br />\nWEDNESDAY, DECEMBER 3 - Boston University Law<br />\nSchool<br />\nSIGN UP FOR INTERVIEWS IN PLACEMENT BUREAU,<br />\n100 WHITEHEAD HALL<br />\n<br />\nLiberal Arts Majors Interested in Employment with<br />\nNational Security Agency should file application by November 21 to take exam on December 6.<br />\nGraduate students and seniors in non-science fields who<br />\nare interested in government careers should take the<br />\nFederal Service entrance exam early in the academic year.<br />\nExams are given monthly through May.<br />\nApplications for these exams available in placement<br />\nbureau.<br />\nGraduate students and seniors (planning to go to grad<br />\nschool) in Engineering, Math, Physics, and Chemistry<br />\nwho are interested in summer employment should register<br />\nimmediately at placement bureau.<br />\nnt;6:17.26,4<br />\n<br />\nDR. ROBERT ROTHSTEIN<br />\n<br />\nDR. HANS MORGENTHAU<br />\n<br />\nMorgenthau, however, refused to back<br />\ndown. He continued to call for a<br />\ndeemphasis on nuclear power. \"One must<br />\nattempt,\" he said, \"to eradicate<br />\nthe<br />\nfeeling that a nuclear war will be at all<br />\nacceptable.\"<br />\nHe persisted in denying that war plans<br />\ncan be made on a McNamara-like death/<br />\neffectiveness basis, and argued that no<br />\none<br />\ncan estimate the psychological<br />\ndamage to a nation which has lost 20<br />\nmillion persons. \"We must never let<br />\nthe government get the feeling that the 20<br />\nmillion dead figure is an acceptable one,\"<br />\nhe reiterated.<br />\nLater Morgenthau ciriticized Brenne's argument as a \"mechanical\" one.<br />\nRothstein, though, despite his earlier<br />\naggressiveness, was milder on<br />\nhis<br />\ncolleague. \"I think his views are surpriseingly moderate,\" he said, \"despite<br />\ntheir lack of political content.

The thirteen<br />\n\"Motherfuckers\" present led in the chanting of \"Sieg<br />\nHeil.\"<br />\nThe leaflet distributed by SDS attacked Stennis for<br />\nhis support of \"the ABM system, the MIRV Ballistic<br />\nMissile System...and the development of fast deployment vessels\" to be used in quick U.S. interventions.<br />\nNoting that these vessels are being built in Mississippi<br />\nshipyards under a $130 million contract, the leaflet<br />\nquestioned whether Senator Stennis' chairmanship \"had<br />\nanything to do withe Mississippi location of the contract.\"<br />\nBut To Disrupt<br />\nSDS leaders felt that they undertook a \"combined action linking Stennis with racism and imperialism\" and<br />\nnoted that \"there was a tremendous amount of audience<br />\nParticipation in hasslingStennis.\" AnSDS spokesmanfelt<br />\nthat when \"people like Mansfield and Tydings defend a<br />\nblatant racist and fascist like Stennis, this shows where<br />\ntheir true interests lie.\"<br />\nThe letters sent by Symposium leaders, observed one<br />\nParticipant in the demonstration, \"place them on the side<br />\nof Stennis. They're expressing more concern over a few<br />\ndiscourteous interruptions than discourtesies to black<br />\npeople in Mississippi and around the country and to<br />\nVietnamese people and American souldiers.\"<br />\nRobert Bilgrave, Director of Student Affairs \"deplored the interruptions to Senator Stennis' talk and language used.\" While no disciplinary action will be taken,<br />\nBilgrave expressed the interntion of recommendingto the<br />\nCommittee on Student Affairs that it consider a policy<br />\nregarding treatment of visitors on campus.<br />\ngenerally condemned<br />\nAt a Tuesday luncheon, attended by student leaders<br />\n<br />\nadministration personnel and Dr. Gordon, the treatment<br />\naccorded Senator Stennis was generally condemned.<br />\nThe eight students and five administrators present<br />\nagreed that the heckling served no purpose and reflected<br />\nbadly on the university. However,there was disagreement<br />\nover the steps which should be taken to prevent such<br />\nincidents from recurring.<br />\nThe Sunpapers sharply attacked the reception given<br />\nStennis in a Tuesday morning editorial. The only thing<br />\ndisrupters achieved, according to the editorial, \"was<br />\nwhatever cheap thrill comes with self-righteous arrogance....On any similar occasion we suggest they would<br />\nbe wholly justified in removing such disrupters physically.\"<br />\nSenator Mansfield stressed the lack of courtesy<br />\nshown to Senator Stennis. With courtesy on both sides, he<br />\nobserved, \"I think we would be less likely to resort to<br />\nviolence, epithets, neme-calling and other forms of<br />\nabuse which do none of us any good and, in fact, do this<br />\nnation great harm.\"<br />\n<br />\nMississippi Senator John Stennis ignored the costumed<br />\nstudents below him and outlined his views on how \"America must develop policies and precedents to accomplish arms limitation while keeping the balance of<br />\npower in the hands of peace-loving nations.\"<br />\n\"There is no such thing as total disarmament\u2014it is<br />\nnot going to happen in our time,\" he noted. Someone<br />\nshouted \"not while your _in power!\" \"To the extent<br />\nthat the United States can reduce arms without incurring<br />\nthe danger of aggression I favor gradual disarmament,\"<br />\nthe Senator continued.<br />\nStennis, who became a member of the Senate in<br />\n1948, felt that the \"requirement for military strength<br />\nsufficient to deter and repel aggression is equally important to the meeting of our domestic needs.\" This<br />\nstatement was greeted with shouts of \"shame!\"<br />\nAny negotiations toward arms limitation \"must be<br />\ncommenced from as strong a position as possible.\"<br />\nStennis labelled the arms limitation talks, which are<br />\nscheduled to begin this month in Helsinki, \"a potential<br />\nturning point in histroy.\"<br />\nBut he stressed the need<br />\nfor caution since \"the history of past association with<br />\nRussia offers no basis for optimism.\"<br />\n<br />\nFree Speech<br />\nSenator Mathias felt that a significant free speech<br />\nissue was raised by the hecklers. He noted that \"arbitrary individuals\" as well as \"arbitrary government\"<br />\ncan interrupt the \"rational exchange of ideas.\"<br />\nOn the other hand, many persons present felt that<br />\nno serious abridgement of free speech took place. A<br />\nWCBM newsman stated that the protest activities were<br />\n\"within the realm of dialogue.\" Several students observed<br />\nthat Senator Stennis wak always able to continue his<br />\nspeech. A faculty member pointed out that \"Senator<br />\nStennis doesn't really need our podium to communicate his opinions.\"<br />\n<br />\nSoviet Exploits<br />\nSince \"the Soviets can be expected to exploit the<br />\nthe talks for propaganda and other pruposes,\" observed<br />\nStennis, \"we must ascertain the balance of power before<br />\nmaking any agreement.

Many individuals<br />\non this campus find ROTC program among<br />\nHopkins students is declining, and the<br />\npresence of ROTC directly hinders the<br />\ntraining of scholars, a primary function<br />\nof the University. This letter may not do<br />\njustice to the subject, but it does outline<br />\nbriefly what I believe to be important<br />\npoints for serious consideration.<br />\nI do not feel that the University should<br />\nhave a contractural obligationto produce<br />\n\"a minimum of twenty five officers per<br />\nyear\" from \"a Department of Military<br />\nScience as an integral academic and administrative department of the institution<br />\nand to adopt as part of its curriculum...<br />\nmilitary instruction...which the Secretary of the Army will prescribe and<br />\nconduct.\" (Quoted from<br />\nAgreement<br />\nRegarding Facilities to be Provided for<br />\nthe Use of the Army Reserve Officers'<br />\nTraining Corps Program, Without Expense to the Department of the Army,<br />\nsigned March 11, 1965). That ROTC<br />\n<br />\ncourses are no longer given academic<br />\ncredit is irrelevant. Admittedly, this<br />\ncontract does not interfere with my<br />\n\"rights and freedoms\" (Dr. Gordon on<br />\nMay 16, 1969), but it does make me question the purpose of life spent at an institution<br />\nholding<br />\nsuch contractural<br />\nobligations and the viewpoint that underlies maintenance of such contract in<br />\nthe modern world.<br />\nThe accompanying Table was compiled<br />\nfrom the annual Report of the Faculties<br />\nand Administration. The data shows that<br />\nstudent participation in ROTC in the<br />\n1930's and again in the 1950's ranged<br />\nfrom 28-52 per year. In spite of a<br />\nsignificantly higher student population<br />\nand pressures of the Vietnam war, participation and commissions in recent<br />\nyears run only about half of the earlier<br />\nperiods. Not only has interest in ROTC<br />\nwaned, but throughout its publicly recorded history ROTC has been tremondously wasteful of student effort.<br />\nBoth lack of interest and wastefulness<br />\nof time are exemplified by the following<br />\nexample, rather typical for the 1960's.<br />\nIn 1964, of 109 students enrolled in MSI<br />\nonly 54 finished, only 25 completed MSII<br />\nthe following year, only 17 completed<br />\nMSIII, only 16 completed MSIV, and 15<br />\n<br />\ncommissions resulted. This is a 14%<br />\nyield. As Vietnam tapers off, interest<br />\nis bound to decline even more. The University owns the ROTC buildings; these<br />\nfacilities, for which the University already provides janitorial and maintenance services, could be utilized to greater advantage were the buildings converted to use ,for a wide variety of student<br />\nactivities.<br />\nSince 1967 the \"Total enrolled\" (see<br />\nTable) increasing numbers of students<br />\nfrom Towson State, Baltimore Junior<br />\nCollege, and U. Maryland Law School.<br />\nparticipation of these \"Good<br />\nThe<br />\nNeighbors\" in a Hopkins activity must be<br />\nweighed in terms of, for example, the<br />\nparticipation of \"Not-So-Good-Neighbors\" in anti-Rotc demonstrations.<br />\nWhy is Hopkins \"Good Neighbor Policy\"<br />\npublicized with regard to ROTC<br />\nbut<br />\nvieled with regard to other exchanges,<br />\nsuch interactions with Morgan<br />\nState<br />\nCollege?<br />\nFinally, we may examine in the Table<br />\nthe vastly increased monetary input into<br />\nthe student wallet, estimated as increasing from $17,000 to well over $80,000<br />\nin the last three years. From 1956 through about 1964 ROTC participants<br />\nearned 90C per day; in 1965 this was<br />\n<br />\nchanged to $40/month. In 1966<br />\ntwo<br />\n4-year and three 2-year scholarships<br />\nwith all tuition, -books, and fees, plus<br />\n$50/month, were assigned to Hopkins.<br />\nOther students have elected to bring<br />\nArmy scholarships to Hopkins so that<br />\nby 1968 there were 22 students on full<br />\nROTC money. It is not clear if these<br />\nstudents are selectively admitted. In<br />\nany event, aboliton of ROTC at Hopkins (unfortunately!) would still leave<br />\na wide range of universities that students could take their Army scholarships to. It in no way would endanger<br />\nHopkins financial structure. Enrollment of these students elsewhere would<br />\nbe to Hopkins great benefit. Following<br />\ngraduation they are committed to<br />\n6<br />\nyears in the Army including two to four<br />\nyears of active duty. It seems unlikely<br />\nthat, once Vietnam subsides, these men<br />\ncan compete with students uncommitted to active military service and become tomorrow's scholars.<br />\nPhilip E.

The program has been surviving on a $1,000 loan from the university's<br />\ncontingency fund. Because this money will<br />\nnot last substantially longer, Dr. Wickwire has been exploring every possible<br />\nsourse of additional funds.<br />\n<br />\nBusses Still Needed<br />\nThe problems of funding the Saturday<br />\nmorning program may be solved soon, he<br />\nnoted. The Community Action Agencies,<br />\nwhich have worked with Hopkins in organizing the Saturday morning program,<br />\nalways have access to money. George<br />\nKoutouzos of the Levering Hall staff stated that two of the six C.A.A.'s have already started providing busses to bring<br />\nthe tutees to the Hopkins campus. Dr.<br />\nWickwire feels confident that the other<br />\nfour C.A.A.'s will start doing so soon.<br />\nBusses are the major expense of the<br />\ntutoring program. Wickwire stated he is<br />\nworking hard to get agency support and<br />\nmoney.<br />\nThe problems . of the Tuesday and<br />\n<br />\nSPECIAL<br />\nNOTICE<br />\nStudent<br />\nand<br />\nFaculty<br />\nDiscounts<br />\n<br />\nThursday evening program, which are<br />\nrun in connection with the public schools,<br />\nare further from solution. Dr. Wickwire<br />\nmentioned Dr. William Bevan has been<br />\nmentioned Dr. William Bevan vice-president of Hopkins and top administrator<br />\nfor Levering, has been of great help in<br />\nLevering's search for funds. He and Dr.<br />\nWickwire are planning to see Dr. Sheldon, the superintendent of Baltimore public schools, since there is still the possibility of financial aid from his office.<br />\nMr. Blaisdell, Bevan's assistant, is finding out which federal agencies may be<br />\nable to provide money for the program.<br />\nHEW, HUD and 0E0 grants are possibilities according to V/ickwire.<br />\nThe University Chaplain also said<br />\nthat he and Dr. Bevan would be working<br />\nwith representatives of the Johns Hopkins Fund, whose function is to find private funds and individuals that may be<br />\nwilling to donate money for activities on<br />\nthe campuses of the university. Levering is exploring the possibilities of a<br />\nbenefit performance in Shriver Hall by<br />\nsome well-known artist or group. Other<br />\nideas may be developed tomorrow at a<br />\nmeeting of high school volunteers in the<br />\ntutoring program. Dr. Wickwire felt certain that one or another of these ideas<br />\nwill prove fruitful, and expected results<br />\nwithin two weeks.<br />\n<br />\ning program a richer one than it has been<br />\nin previous years. They are giving the<br />\nparents of the tutors the chance to tell<br />\nthem what they think ought to be done in<br />\nthe program, and what aspects of tutoring are most important to them.<br />\n<br />\nTeacher's Opinions<br />\nAlso, an attempt is being made to relate the tutors to the public schoolteachers of the tutees. In past years teachers have provided only minimal information about each tutee, their reading and<br />\nmath levels, and the teacher's opinions<br />\nof the children's particular needs. The<br />\ntutors are being encouraged to get in<br />\ntouch with the teachers, in order to discuss their individual tutees work at<br />\nschool. Those tutors who have already<br />\ndone this describe the teachers as being<br />\ngenerally quite cooperative. Further enrichment of the program may result from<br />\nLevering's policy of trying to maintain<br />\nyear-by-year contact with the same<br />\nchildren.<br />\nDan Smith of the Student Association<br />\nexpressed enthusiasm about the program,<br />\nparticularly the Tuesday and Thursday<br />\nsection. He estimated that the number<br />\nof tutor-tutee pairs in this program to<br />\nbe about seventy, with about thirty of the<br />\ntutors enrolled in the tutoring course.<br />\nHe said that this program was running<br />\n\"extraordinarily well.\"<br />\n<br />\nWickwire said that he and his staff<br />\nwere trying to make this year's tutor-<br />\n<br />\nWe need your head in our<br />\nbusiness<br />\n<br />\nJEN'S<br />\n<br />\nPaul Barber Shop<br />\n3120 St. Paul St.<br />\nAcross from Eddie'c<br />\n<br />\n.<br />\n<br />\nBrakes<br />\nAlignment<br />\nTune-Up<br />\nGrease & Oil Change<br />\nShock Absorbers<br />\nMufflers<br />\nAnti-Freeze<br />\nWheels<br />\n<br />\nPaul<br />\nSchnitzer<br />\nTire Co.<br />\n1027-39<br />\nHillen St.<br />\n539 5390<br />\n<br />\nSUBMARINES<br />\nDOUBLEBURGERS<br />\nEAT-IN OR CARRY-OUT<br />\nST.

Step out of line and<br />\nthe axe will fall.<br />\nBut really dear Hoppies, could there<br />\nhave been any other decision than that<br />\nissued on October 17?

Really, who<br />\ndo Bilgrave, Kimball, et al. think they<br />\nare kidding? Either the administration<br />\nis trule scared of its \"effete corps of<br />\nimpudent snobs\" or thinks it can quiet<br />\ndissent by channelling it rhough a quasijudicial procedure. The whitewash of<br />\nan appeals court with its faculty and administration representatives has been<br />\nused to hide the glaring fact that the<br />\nadministration still has its head stuck<br />\nin the sand when it comes to allowingthe<br />\nstudent to act as a free agent on Homewood Campus, or at least with a minimum<br />\nof red tape.

Treem, Class of 1969<br />\n<br />\nBIGOTS VS. PIGOTS<br />\nTo the Editors:<br />\nThe SDS would have us believe that<br />\nOne who discriminates because of race,<br />\ncreed, or color, is a bigot and a pig. I<br />\nagree. Because of his Southern heritage, senator John C. Stennis was associated with the KKK and Confederate flag<br />\nby two SDS big guns dressed in posh<br />\nHalloween garb. Surely there is enough<br />\nin the Senator's voting record to justify<br />\na point by point attack of his policies by<br />\nmost liberals. When then must some<br />\ncontinue to harass individuals because of<br />\ntheir geographical location? Does not<br />\n<br />\nthe Senator deserve the same rights<br />\naccorded by white liberals to blacks;<br />\nthat is to be judged solely by his performance?<br />\nThese local SDS leaders<br />\nwould have use believe they are not bigots<br />\nand pigots (sic). I disagree.<br />\nDavid Thorndill<br />\n<br />\nAH,SWEET DEMOCRACY<br />\nTo the Editors:<br />\nI would like to make a few comments<br />\non Steve Blumenthal's analysis of Dr.<br />\nGeorge Wald's military-industrial complex lecture. For all his criticisms,<br />\nBlumenthal ends up in the same boat as<br />\nWald: neither of them has a vision of a<br />\npossible solution to the economically<br />\nwasteful spending which characterizes<br />\nour economic system.<br />\nBut Blumenthal's analysis of the problem is right: It will be mighty difficult,<br />\nif not impossible, for this capitalistic<br />\nsystem to cope with disarmament, without creating serious problems of unemployment and/or inflation. Which analysis, in itself, is a rather devastating<br />\ncritique of capitalism, if Blumenthal<br />\nwould only admit it.<br />\nBut to complete the analysis, we<br />\nshouldn't stop at military spending. What<br />\nabout the huge expenditures big business<br />\nmakes in advertising, which are costs<br />\nborne by the consumer, but which add<br />\nnothing to the quality of the commodity?<br />\nWhat about the waste of housing, and<br />\nmalnutrition, conditions which could be<br />\neliminated if we dated to eliminate the<br />\nexploitative profits which are perpetuated by this waste?<br />\nWhat about the<br />\nwaste of human labor which results from<br />\nplanned commodity obsolescence, planned to keep sales and profits up?<br />\nWell, it's probably impossible to eliminate any of these wastes within the<br />\ncapitalist framework, because the crux<br />\nof the problem is that socially useful<br />\nactivity is not always profitable activity<br />\nin the eyes of the pig-headed businessmen who run the economy, the government, and our lives.<br />\nSo I submit: If we are to change the<br />\npresent state of affairs, we must runthe<br />\n<br />\nBEDLAM BOUTIQUE<br />\n<br />\neconomy for everybody , and ,ot just for<br />\nthe lazy rich people who live off unearned<br />\nprofits. This is a difficult solution to<br />\nachieve, for it requires political, and<br />\nprobably armed, struggle. Furthermore,<br />\na satisfactory solution will only be<br />\nachieved after a long process of trial<br />\nand error. Look at China and Cuba, in<br />\ntheir continuing struggle to create a just<br />\neconomic and social order. It's an uphill<br />\nfight, but the alternative is downhill,<br />\nstagnating, capitalism, which needs huge<br />\ndoses of wasteful government spending,<br />\nconsumer credit, and foreign markets to<br />\nkeep it moving.<br />\nJust one more point. In the last paragraph of his article, Blumenthal confuses<br />\nliberals with the new left.

I<br />\nagree that it would be a \"dangerous<br />\nprecedent\" for judicial bodies \"to make<br />\nmotivation itself a legal acquittal for<br />\nmisconduct.\" However, it is my understanding that the appeal was not upheld<br />\non the grounds of the motivation of the<br />\nappellants.<br />\nRather, it was upheld because \"no<br />\nsubstantial infringement of the rights of<br />\nothers occurred as a result of\" the<br />\nband's playing at the teach-in: the disturbance the band created was minimal<br />\nin comparison with that caused by the<br />\nother, administration-approved, teachin activities.<br />\nIt is true that, in Mr.<br />\nGleser's words, the \"appellant students<br />\ndeliberately disobeyed a direct order<br />\nfrom 'an' administrative officer.\" But<br />\nthe Committee's decision in upholding<br />\nthe appeal seems to imply that disobedience of administrative orders does not<br />\nconstitute prima facie evidence of the<br />\ninfringement of rights of others.The use<br />\nof the latter principle independently of<br />\nthe identity of the complainant seems to<br />\nme the best assurance of the impartial<br />\njustice whose maintenance is rightly of<br />\nconcern to Mr. Gleser.<br />\nFinally, in the light of the discussion<br />\nof the draft conduct statement currently<br />\ngoing on in the Student Affairs Committee, it seems likely that the clause<br />\nwhich troubles Mr. Gleser will be modified. Hence I suspect that the Committee<br />\nis in agreement with Mr. Gleser on this<br />\npoint, although this view and others in<br />\nthis letter are my own, and do not constitute the Committee's official position.<br />\nRich Con riser, Social Relations<br />\n<br />\nTHE HOPKINS WOMAN<br />\nTo The Editors:<br />\nIn view of the recent decision to admit<br />\nwomen to undergraduate programs at<br />\nJohns Hopkins University, I feel compelled to bring forth an age old argument in opposition.<br />\nThe competition for graduates of the<br />\nprestigeous schools in industry has<br />\nnever been more keen.

About tomorrow's tilt with<br />\nSwarthmore, Sotir asserts, \"No game can be considered a breather<br />\nwhen you have 74 points scored on you in two games and your offense<br />\ndoesn't even score once.\"<br />\nAdmittedly, the statistic sheets have looked more and more dismal<br />\nafter the Hampden-Sydney and Carnegie-Mellonfiascoes. Individuals<br />\ncould be cited, but that would prove little since those who made mis\u2022<br />\ntakes already know it.<br />\nThe most glaring and obvious statistic is the team's recent failure<br />\nto score more than their opponents. Over six games, the offense has<br />\naccounted for 109 points; the defense has let in 143 points.<br />\nExcuses could be offered such as the injuries to Dave Pickall,<br />\nChuck Pinsky, and other key personnel, but this shirks the real issue.<br />\nWhat is at stake is a team's pride. If they really are hungry, they<br />\nwill start to redeem themselves by first crushingSwarthmore tomorrow, then upsetting Dickinson, and finishing up by blowing Western<br />\nright out of Homewood Field on November 22. But that<br />\nMaryland<br />\nmeans they've got to really want to do it.<br />\nThat means getting up for each game and cutting down on the number<br />\nof turnovers (fumbles and interceptions).<br />\n<br />\nBy ED BRETHAUER<br />\nLast Saturday, the Hopkins Bluejays spoiled<br />\nthe Loyola Greyhounds' 32 game streak without a<br />\nloss by downing them, 1-0. The game was marked by some great offensive play on the part of<br />\nAlbee Samper and Bob Szeles, and excellent defensive play by every member of the team.<br />\nThe first quarter showed what kind of game<br />\nHopkins was to play the rest of the afternoon.<br />\nActual shots on goal by Hopkins were a small<br />\nnumber compared to those by Loyola, but the<br />\nHopkins defense, led by Steve Weiss, held tough.<br />\nIn the first quarter, Weiss had to face two direct<br />\nkicks, several line drive shots right at him, and a<br />\ncouple shots bouncing directly in front of the goal.<br />\nYet, with the help of Randy Miller, Keith Ross, Pat<br />\nBarry, and the defense, Weiss was able to hold<br />\nLoyola to no score.<br />\nThe second quarter seemed to model the first<br />\nalmost exactly, with a little more offensive provided by Linemen Pat Barry and Albee Sampler.<br />\nLoyola continued, though, to dominate the offensive play, either by stealing the ball or by penalties to Hopkins. Weiss was again forced to make<br />\nseveral saves on corner kicks and direct shots,<br />\nthough some of Loyola's shots were nullified by<br />\npenalties. Rick tobey and John Clisham also blocked several good shots, though the key play of the<br />\nquarter was Weiss' diving save of a ball which had<br />\nbounced off the goalpost. The score at the end of<br />\nthe half was still 0-0.<br />\n<br />\nWho's to Blame?<br />\nPerhaps the fault does not lay entirely with the team. Sotir, two<br />\nYears ago, began to build awinning tradition in football which involves<br />\nthe fans as well as the football players. He gave Hopkins something<br />\nto cheer about besides lacrosse. Yet this year the team has played<br />\nbefore diminishing crowds at every home game. More than losing,<br />\nwe feel the ridiculous policy of charging admission to blame.<br />\nSotir has never lost faith in his team's ability to play good football.<br />\nIn fact he is confident that they will before the season is over. It is<br />\ntime the team started believing in themselves and got the job done.<br />\nAt long last a permanent Athletic Committee has been formed to<br />\ncope with the mounting problems of the Physical Education Department. However, the Athletic Committee's effectiveness has been<br />\nlimited by its deep entanglement in the university's often inefficient<br />\nbureaucracy.<br />\nThe committee has been added as a' sub-committee of Dr. John<br />\nWhite's Committee on Student Affairs - a sort of added lower rung<br />\non Dr. Gordon's bureacratic ladder. Theoretically, a recommendation would have to go through White's committee, next the Academic<br />\nCouncil, then Homewood House, and finally ending with the Board of<br />\nTrustees.<br />\nBy misplacing the Athletic Committee (more people than students<br />\nare involved and affected) as a sub-committee of the Committee on<br />\nStudent Affairs, the administation is unnecessarily complicating the<br />\ncommittee system which Dr. Gordon do strongly advocates. A more<br />\nautonomous Athletic Committee is what we had in mind when we recommended the creation of such a committee.<br />\n<br />\nOffense Psyched<br />\nHopkins came into the third quarter a little<br />\nmore psyched up on offense, and responded with<br />\na beautiful goal on a cross from Bob Szeles to<br />\nAlbee Samper, who headed it directly into the net.<br />\nAfter this goal, the whole team seemed sparked,<br />\ndespite the referees' rather technical calls. The<br />\ndefense constantly stopped Loyola's progress<br />\ndownfield, and sent the ball up toSamper and the<br />\nother linemen, who came close to actually scoring at least two more time during the quarter.<br />\nBut the defense again deserves.the most credit,<br />\nled especially by Randy Miller, Rick Tobey, and<br />\nSteve Weiss during this quarter. Though the actual shots on the goalie were decreased, Weiss made<br />\nseveral spectacular saves, especially one on a<br />\nloose ball rolling right in ront of the net.<br />\nNear the end of the third quarter and the beginning of the fourth, the refs made several controversial calls which really did not hurt Hopkins<br />\nthat much. Every player on the field and every<br />\nsubstitute was determined at that point not to let<br />\nLoyola score, and their play showed it.<br />\n<br />\nSteve Weiss leaps high in air for a save. Weiss has<br />\n4 shut-outs so far this year. Only 5 goals have been<br />\nscored on him in 7 games.<br />\nphoto by hatlis<br />\nIn the last quarter, despite some great shooting by Szeles and Samper, Loyola's offence once<br />\nagain put the pressure on our defense. Great<br />\nplays were made by Danny Hall, Pat Barry, Randy<br />\nMiller, who was everywhere, and,of course,Steve<br />\nWeiss. Weiss caught several line shots by Denny<br />\nWit and Ty Smith, and made a spectacular jumping save on a ballwhich almost went over his head<br />\nin front of the goal. But it was appropriate that,<br />\non the last play of the game,Weiss again protected the lead following a very high kickinghe<br />\n.air<br />\ndirectly in front of the goal.<br />\n<br />\n\"Beat The Best\"<br />\nDuring the three games before last weekend,<br />\nHopkins had shown signs of floundering, due to<br />\nthe great number of injuries which the team had<br />\nsuffered. Nevertheless, the victory against Loyola<br />\nseemed to show how well the substitutes have fit<br />\nin with the play of the team, and how determined<br />\nthe team is to win. As Coach Knauff said, \"I<br />\ncouldn't have been more pleased with the performance of the whole team, especially the defense.<br />\nWe feel we beat the best when we beat Loyola.\"<br />\n<br />\nBIA NOTES<br />\n<br />\nCope Chairs Committee<br />\nThe committee is chaired by Dr. Jackson Cope who was a member<br />\nof last year's ad hoc committee on physical education. Other members<br />\ninclude senior Paul Allen, who is the committee's secretary, and<br />\nfellow senior, Weedy Hammond, who is also presently President of<br />\nthe Booster Club. Richard Barch, is the graduate student representative. Also on the committee are Marshall Turner, Director of<br />\nAthletics and head football coach Alex Sotir.<br />\nSome of the issues facing the committee are a review of the admissions policy to athletic events, and financial sanction of post<br />\nseason play. Also to be considered is the freshman petition to drop<br />\nphysed. Another concern is repair and maintenance of the Athletic<br />\nCenter which, supposedly, is the responsibility of the Plant Manager's<br />\nOffice. Earlier in the year atrocious conditions of the squash courts<br />\nand the showers brought irate letters from faculty members.<br />\nWe welcome the creation of the committee but regret that it doe\u2018<br />\nnot have a more direct line to Dr. Gordon's ear. We encourage the<br />\ncommittee to take an active part in solving the Athletic Department's<br />\nproblems. Also, we warn against the committee becoming too complacent.<br />\nAt the two-hour first meeting on October 30 of the committee, it<br />\nwas suggested that the committee meet once a month. This we feel is<br />\ntoo infrequent if the committee is to be an effective group. Creation<br />\nof the committee was long overdue.

The Jays were not only<br />\nheld scoreless, but did not mount a sustained drive after the opening minutes<br />\ninto the game, the Tartans punted and<br />\nCharley Coker ran a twenty yard return<br />\nto Carnegie's 35 yard line. Bob Pfieffer's<br />\nquarterbacking brought the ball down to<br />\nthe five from there but that was the<br />\ndeepest the Jays got.<br />\nThe Jays from there on in were under<br />\ncontinuous pressure from the Tartans.<br />\nPenalites and fumbles marred their performance from the first quarter. They<br />\nrepeatedly got control of the ball only<br />\ndeep in their own territory. Three clipping penalties on kickoffs in addition to 47<br />\nyards worth of other penalties put the<br />\nJays in passing situations a lot of the<br />\ngame.<br />\n<br />\nThe first Carnegie-Mellow touchdown<br />\nwas set up after Charley Coker fumbled<br />\na punt and the Tartans recovered on the<br />\nBlue Jay twenty yard line. Four plays<br />\nlater, the Tartans' Freshman fullback,<br />\nTerry Bell, ran into the end zone from<br />\nnine yards out.<br />\nAfter this initial Blue Jay mistake,<br />\nBobby Pfieffer and later Dan Augustine<br />\nquarterbacked Hopkins using the passing<br />\nattack extensively against the strong pass<br />\nsecondary of Carnegie-Mellon. What resulted was only twelve completed passes<br />\nin 29 attempts for 103 yards. The Jays'<br />\nquarterbacks were forced to scramble<br />\nmany more times when their receivers<br />\nwere covered.

The Blue<br />\nJays offense never really got moving.<br />\nThey got inside Carnegie's thirty yard<br />\nline only twice and both times lost the<br />\nball on fumbles. Most of the game was<br />\nplayed on Hopkins' half of the field and<br />\nthe Blue Jays spent the afternoon on<br />\nthe defensive.<br />\nThe Tartans hammered away at the<br />\nBlue Jay defenses, and scored two<br />\ntouchdowns in each of the first three quarters.<br />\nThe drive for the Tartans'third touchdown was started after the Blue Jays<br />\npunted and downed the ball on Carnegie's<br />\n47 yard line. In two plays, the ball was<br />\nbrought to Hopkins' 36 yard line. After<br />\nbeing held temporarily for two downs,<br />\nRichie Squires threw a little swing pass<br />\nto Terry Bell, a play that later went 32<br />\nyards for the Tartans' last touchdown<br />\nin the third wuarter. With the ball now on<br />\nthe Hopkins' nineteen, it took three plays<br />\nto finally score. All three of them were<br />\nruns with Tom Lombardo scoring on the<br />\nthird.<br />\nThe Tartans played the second half<br />\ncontaining the Blue Jay passing offense<br />\nand weakened running attack. Steve Utz,<br />\nDan Augustine, and Steve Hata gained<br />\n97 yards for the losers, while the Jays'<br />\nnumber one rusher, Paul Weiss, played<br />\nlinebacker. Meanwhile, the Tartans kept<br />\nthe ball in Hopkins' territory and played<br />\nagainst the clock.<br />\nThe game was the worst for the Blue<br />\nJays since their loss,48-6, against Dickinson in 1965. Dickinson is one the leading contenders in the Middle Atlantic<br />\nConference so far this year, and,although<br />\nthe Blue Jays still have a good shot at<br />\nthe title, they will have to beat Dickinson away on November 15.<br />\nTomorrow, Hopkins plays Swarthmore,<br />\none of the teams occuping the cellar of<br />\nthe MAC.

The Admissions Office has not yet<br />\nreceived official word or when to start<br />\npublicizing the new decision to other universities and high schools.

CRAMER<br />\nAs you admire the feminine additions<br />\nto the<br />\ncampus next year, and thank the<br />\nfates that you are part of the \"enlightened\" generation, remember that the<br />\nidea of woman undergraduates at Hopkins stems from the silent, stolid 'fifties.<br />\nThat men and women belong together<br />\nwas known long before you, I or even<br />\nDr. Corwin was born. But the idea that<br />\nthe Homewood campus<br />\nwas a suitable<br />\nPlace to bring them together was seriously discussed beginning in 1953.<br />\nIt was at this point that informal talks<br />\nbetween Hopkins and<br />\nGoucher began, with<br />\nthe idea that the two<br />\nNews-Letter<br />\nschools would do better as one. Dean<br />\nNEWS\u2022<br />\nRhoda<br />\nDorsey of<br />\nGoucher has said that<br />\nANALYSIS<br />\ntalk of merging the<br />\ntwo schools has been<br />\ngoing on for fifteen<br />\nyears.<br />\nLast year, speculation came to a head<br />\nWhen the two schools engaged in a more<br />\nformal discussion of the possibilities.<br />\nDean Dorsey and Dean Carl Swanson<br />\nmet several times to explore the subject.<br />\nThe recommendations of the Academic<br />\nCouncil that Hopkins admit coeds seem<br />\nto have<br />\nsquelched merger plans for the<br />\nindefinite future.<br />\nHopkins rejected the idea of merging<br />\nfor several reasons. Although the excellent facilities of the Goucher campus<br />\nwould eliminate the need for Hopkins to<br />\nadd to or alter its plant to accomodate<br />\nwomen, the problem of shunting students<br />\nbetween the two campuses would have<br />\nProved difficult to overcome.While thoughts about merging were still in vogue,<br />\nPresident Gordon suggested that the<br />\nGoucher campus be used to house and<br />\nteach freshmen and sophomores of both<br />\nsexes.

The<br />\npractical realities are not that great. Reports show that we can go coed immediately if we want to put in the work.\"<br />\nA second major question that must be<br />\nanswered by the Task Force is whether<br />\nwomen students will displace or supplement the male student body. President<br />\nGordon in his memo suggested that the<br /><br />\nfuture freshmen classes be increased to<br />\n600, including 150 to 200 women and 400<br />\nto 450 men.<br />\nDean Swanson stated, \"I think that we<br />\nare crowded now\" in response to the<br />\nquestion of increasing the undergraduate<br />\npopulation. \"To increase the student body<br />\nwe must make sure that we can service<br />\nand educate them,' he noted. \"This'<br />\nmeans, of course, more faculty, space<br />\nand courses. At the present time I haven't<br />\nheard what our expansion plans are and if<br />\nwe have the money.\"<br />\nDr. James C. Walker of the Physics<br />\nDepartment and member of the Task<br />\nForce said that he would support\"a small<br />\nincrease in size of the undergraduates.\"<br />\n\"It would be a mistake to decrease the<br />\nnumber of male students here,\" he claimed.<br />\nOther questions Gordon asked the Task<br />\nForce to study are the impact of coeducation on present and potential arrangements for collaboration between Johns<br />\nHopkins and Goucher College, the possible additional requirements for staff in<br />\nthe health and related services and the<br />\nimpact of coeducation on requirements<br />\nfor student financial aid.<br />\nLast May's Committee on Coeducation Report stated that the addition of<br />\nwomen undergraduates would increase<br />\nthe size of the pool of qualified applicants<br />\nfrom which our undergraduate body is<br />\ndrawn, increase the diversity of the courses, especially in the Humanities, and<br />\nwould \"improve the intellectual and<br />\nsocial environment on campus.\"<br />\n\"We wish to make quite clear,\" the<br />\nreport states, \"that we believe Hopkins'<br />\nmission to be the pursuit of intellectual<br />\nexcellence at all levels,not to experiment<br />\nin social living or adjustment. Nevertheless, the real world is bisexual, and we<br />\ncan see no reason why intellectual pursuits cannot be similarly so.\"<br /><br />\nPolitics, Pedantry, Prestige<br /><br />\nto Homewood for their upperclass years.<br />\nThe problem of merging the two student bodies, however, seemed simple<br />\nwhen placed next to the task of uniting<br />\nthe two faculties. It was the fears of the<br />\nfaculty which prevented the merger plans<br />\nfrom ever becoming reality and which<br />\ndictated that this school accept its own<br />\ncoeds if it wanted women undergraduates.<br />\nFaculty objections to a Goucher-Hopkins merger can be grouped into three<br />\ngeneral categories: political, academic<br />\nand professional. The faculty wields all<br />\nof the political power at Hopkins presently. The unit of government is the<br />\ndepartment, and as any Hopkins administrator will mournfully tell you, the<br />\ndepartments here do precisely what they<br />\nwant (assuming that the funds are there).<br />\nA union of the faculties of the two<br />\nschools would wreak havoc with this<br />\nstrict adherence to the departmental<br />\nsystem as it now exists. Consider that<br />\nGoucher has a faculty in American Studies. Would that department be subsumed<br />\nunder one of Hopkins departments? English? History? Humanities? Or would it<br />\nbe allowed to survive the merge? The<br />\nlast possibility strikes the most terror<br />\ninto the hearts of the faculty.If a department (comprised only of Goucher professors) were admitted into the Hopkins<br />\nfaculty and given equal status with the<br />\nestablished departments<br />\nthe faculty<br />\nwould consider its autonomy, authority<br />\nand importance threatened.<br />\nThe difference and conflicts in departmental structure points out the<br />\nsecond category into which arguments<br />\nagainst merging fell. This is the area of<br />\nacademic concerns. Professors<br />\nat<br />\nGoucher and Hopkins do not always see<br />\neye on exactly how their subjects are to<br />\nbe taught. The Hopkins faculty knew that<br />\nthis would cause problems. Take, for<br />\nexample, the Psychology Departments<br />\nof the two schools.Goucher's department<br />\nis concerned with psychological theory<br /><br />\nto a much greater extent than is that of<br />\nHopkins. On paper, it looks as though<br />\nthe fact that the two departments differ<br />\nwould make for one well-rounded department upon consolidation. However, this<br />\ncould not occur.<br />\nHopkins' departments are small.They<br />\ntend<br />\nto specialize in a particular<br />\nacademic or methodological area. If it<br />\nis (as in the case of Psychology) behaviorist, there is very little room or<br />\nwelcome for a psychologist whose acaw elcome for a psychologist whose<br />\nacademic views differ.Similar situations<br />\nwould no doubt occur when dealing with<br />\nthe History departments, Biology departments, etc.<br />\nIn many cases, the fact that the members of the departments disagree over<br />\nacademic matters leads them to downgrade the worth of the other department entirely. Thus, we come to the third<br />\nreason for faculty resistance to a Hopkins-Goucher merge. Last year, when<br />\nrumors that an agreement was imminent<br />\nwere flying, several faculty members<br />\ncontended that the move was unwise because appending Goucher professors onto<br />\nthe Hopkins faculty would lower the standards of tl- faculty.<br />\nThis is simply a matter of academic<br />\nprestige. The argument most frequently<br />\nheard is that without a union of the two<br />\nschools, few of the Goucher faculty would<br />\nbe asked to join the ranks of Hopkins professors. The research done by Goucher<br />\nprofessors (it is claimed) is not up to<br />\nHopkins' high standards. It is a fact that<br />\nthe faculty at Goucher is much more<br />\noriented toward teaching than is the Hopkins faculty. Correspondingly,the amount<br />\nof time devoted and the importance attached to research is not as great. This<br />\nmay well account for the attitude of the<br />\nHopkins faculty.<br />\nThese political, academic and professional objections convinced the faculty<br />\nthat a merger was inadvisable. They<br />\ncertainly would have made it unfeasible.<br /><br />\nBy admitting its own women undergraduates, however, Hopkins has lost certain<br />\nadvantages which a merger woilld have<br />\nprovided.<br />\nFirst, in areas where Goucher is<br />\nclearly superior, Hopkins could have<br />\nbenefited greatly from the union. The<br />\ncase of the language departments is most<br />\nobvious. Goucher is superior in most of<br />\nthe languages and dwarfs Hopkins in<br />\nareas such as Slavic languages.<br />\nSecond, Goucher has strong programs<br />\nin areas which Hopkins completely<br />\nignores. The performing and fine arts<br />\nare of interest to many Hopkins students,<br />\nbut they find nothing at their own school.<br />\nHence, we find more than thirty Hopkins<br />\nundergraduates enrolled in courses at<br />\nGoucher.<br />\nIf sufficient energy and funds were<br />\ndiverted into the language departments<br />\nat Hopkins, they could rival and surpass<br />\nthose of Goucher. However, Hopkins will<br />\nnot develop any kind of fine arts program in the near future.<br />\nAgain, this is due to the reaction of<br />\nthe faculty. It is a cardinal rule at Hopkins that if a Ph.D cannot be granted in<br />\nthe subject, it ought not to be taught.<br />\nThe fine arts and the performing arts<br />\nare areas of increasing interest among<br />\nHopkins students, but by their \"semiacademic\" nature, they are excluded<br />\nfrom Hopkins curriculum.<br />\nIf a Hopkins student wants to take<br />\ncourses in the fine arts, he must take<br />\nthem at another school. Goucher provides the necessary courses. In other<br />\nareas where Goucher provide\u2018: opportunities not found at Hopkins, there will<br />\nalso be an increasing number of enrollees<br />\nfrom Hopkins (in languages, perhaps).<br />\nAlthough the recommendations of the<br />\nAcademic Council preclude any possibility of a merger with Goucher, look<br />\nfor increasing cooperation between the<br />\ntwo schools. Hopkins will find that when<br />\nit has enrolled its own women, it will<br />\nneed the assistance of the College much<br />\nmore than it does presently.<br /><br />\nNEWS\u2014LETTER<br /><br />\nPAGE 4<br /><br />\nNor. 7, 1969<br /><br />\nNixon Speech Aids Moratorium Organizers<br />\n(Continued from page 1)<br />\nJim Cleary, canvassing coordinator<br />\nfor the Hopkins Peace Action Committee, claimed that \"Nixon's the best<br />\nfoil we have.\" \"Canvassing is going<br />\nbeautifully,\" Cleary remarked.

The committee chairman pointed out that Coleman had not taken any sort of leave in<br />\na number of years, and had carried<br />\n\"personally, most of the responsibilities<br />\nfor its successes.\" McClain pointed out, also, that Coleman's leaving necessitates an evaluation<br />\nof the writing seminars in order to determine where it should<br />\nas a<br />\nbe going<br />\nprogram, and to give some direction to<br />\nany successor.<br /><br />\nThis would involve a determination<br />\nof the manner of conductingthe seminars<br />\nso that they would prove to be of most<br />\nvalue to the student: whether to conduct<br />\nthe classes as instructional activities<br />\nteaching the students to write, or to<br />\nmove the seminar into the area of creative writing courses.<br />\nAlso involved is a placement of the<br />\nWriting Seminars in relation to University-wide priorities. The consideration<br />\nis purely a financial conern.

The<br />\nmeeting was called to discuss a proposed letter to the administration outlining the academic users' needs for new<br />\nequipment.<br />\nThe bulk of computing at Homewood<br />\nis done on an IBM 7094 located on D level<br />\nin the library. When it was purchased in<br />\n1967, many computing people here<br />\nthought that the data processingproblem<br />\nhad been solved for the indefinite future.<br />\nBut the increasing sophistication of applications, in what has proven to be an<br />\nexplosively expanding field, has forced<br />\nusers to go off campus, for the convenience of remote \"time-sharing\"<br />\navailable from commercial suppliers.<br />\nOther Hopkins institutions have to be<br /><br />\ntapped when problems become too big to<br />\nfit in the 94's 32,000 word memory.<br />\nThere are additional losses that are<br />\nmuch harder to measure. Many researchers will not even consider a project that requires computing power they<br />\ndon't have. It is difficult to measure the<br />\nprice paid in work not done. On the other<br />\nhand, the man who needs a better machine<br />\nIn an important investigation could go<br />\nsomewhere that has one. In the words of<br />\nDr. Liebman, \"The present level of<br />\ncomputer facilities at Hopkins will be an<br />\nimportant factor in prospective faculty<br />\ndecisions. It certainly would be something I would consider in a decision to<br />\nleave here.\"<br /><br />\nThird Generation Equipment<br />\nThe issue has been brought to ahead,<br />\nhowever, by administrative users rather<br />\nthan academic users. The increasing<br />\ncomplexity of administration recordkeeping demands the facilities that third<br />\ngeneration equipment can make available, such as high speed random access<br />\nfiles and \"spooling,\" the ability to read<br />\ncards or print results while the central<br />\nprocessor (the \"thinking\" part of the<br />\nmachine) busies itself with other things.<br /><br />\nThe 94's central processor would<br />\nhave to sit around twiddling its electronic<br />\nthumbs while the printer did its work.<br />\nFortunately, it has a \"slave\"- -an IBM<br />\n1401 that does its reading andwritingfor<br />\nit. But this smaller computer costs about<br />\n4,000 dollars a monthto rent, money better spent on other things.<br />\nOther facilities that third generation<br />\nequipment provide but are not feasable<br />\non the 94 include remote input of data and<br />\nprinting of results, and Multi-programing, the ability to run more than one<br />\nprogram at one time.<br />\nThe Homewood Administrative Users<br />\nGroup (HAUG), a sub-committee of Dr.<br />\nLiebman's group, is in the final stages of<br />\ndrafting a letter to Mr. Robert Kerley<br />\nvice president of the University for administrative affairs, that outlines their<br />\nneeds for a third generation machine. It<br />\nappears that there argument is irrefutable, and that in one way or another they<br />\nwill get the power they are looking for.<br />\nIt is hoped by those concerned with<br />\nacademic computing at Hopkins that a<br />\ndeal can be worked out which will benefit both groups, providing campus wide<br />\nimprovement in service.<br /><br />\nDigit computing at Homewood began<br />\nin October 1952<br />\n. with the installation of<br />\na small IBM punched card calculator. The<br />\ninstallation was operated for several<br />\nlarge contract supported research projects which were to provide substantially<br />\ncomplete support for it. Unfortuneately,<br />\nthe expected use did not materialize, and<br />\nthe machine was operated at a loss until<br />\n1955 when it was closed down. The fact<br />\nthat it did not generate money enough to<br />\nsupport itself created a lasting skepticism on the part of the administration<br />\nwhich permenently capped the development of computing at Homewood.<br /><br />\nBudget Too Late<br />\nIt was not until late in 1959 that a<br />\ncomputing budget was established and a<br />\nUniversity programmer hired.

None the less, it worked well<br />\nenough so that by May 1963 APL had so<br />\nmuch business coming in that they were<br />\nforced to get another IBM 7094 to carry<br />\nthe load. This second machine was rented<br />\nat a 60% reduced rate because it was to<br />\nbe used only for academic purposes. It<br />\nwould have been desirable to put it on<br />\nthe Homewood compus, but at that time<br />\nthere was simply no room for it.<br />\nWith the completion of the Milton S.<br />\nEisenhower Library, space became<br />\navailable for a large computer at Hopkins. Spurred by a \"Very favorable<br />\nagreement\" on the price, the new 94 at<br />\nAPL was purchased and moved to the<br />\nlibrary where it remains today.<br />\nWhen the new administration building<br />\nis completed early in 1971, the 94 will<br />\nbe moved there to take a secondary role<br />\nto the hoped for third generation machine.<br /><br />\nNov:7, 1969<br /><br />\nNEWS\u2014LE<br /><br />\nE<br /><br />\nPAGE 7<br /><br />\nPanel Debates ABM MIRV,War Strategy<br />\nBy PETER HARNIK<br />\nA panel discussion among three of the<br />\nnation's eminen-political theorists highlighted the fourth event in this year's Milton S.

Costs as the main problem of the<br />\nlibrary. One expensive journal, he stated, has risen 42% over the last year.<br />\nCharles Baughn, an assistant librarian,<br />\nadded that \"the library has been growing in leaps and bounds,\" thus finances<br />\nare a constant headache.<br />\nThe Eisenhower library is spending<br />\n$375,000 or 32% of its present $1,147,790 budget for the purchase of books,<br />\nperiodicals and binding. Berthel noted<br />\nthat such budgetary allocations are normal for most \"good\" libraries.<br />\nThe library has spenimuch of its attention on improving the staff and library<br />\nservices, Berthal stated. However, he<br />\nsaid that new emphasis will be placed<br />\non buying more books and magazines.<br />\n\"It will take us a while to catch up to<br />\nwhere we should be,\" Berthel concluded.<br />\nThe University is now trying to raise<br />\n$10,000,000 in endowement funds for the<br />\nlibrary. However, if the funds cannot be<br />\nobtained as an endowement, the University will try to acquire them in other<br />\nforms according to the chief librarian.<br />\nMr. Berthal also noted that the interest<br />\nfrom the endowment funds will be used<br />\nto purchase books and periodicals, to<br />\nstrenghten the staff, and to start a topical<br />\ncenter of \"more current-type<br />\nbook<br />\nthings.\" But Mr. Berthal warned that<br />\nthis could not be too extensive since the<br />\nlibrary at Hopkins is more geared to<br />\nUniversity curriculum. \"We will never<br /><br />\nbe an Enoch Pratt. That's not the business we're in,\" he contended.<br />\nBesides that large amount of money<br />\nneeded for the purchase of books and<br />\nperiodicals, the library also finds itself<br />\nfaced with vandalism. In the past few<br />\nyears, according to Mr. Baughn, \"there<br />\nhas been some vandalism.\" However, Mr.<br />\nBaughn said that the University has been<br />\nlucky this year in that there has been<br />\nlittle incidence of damage. Exit and elevator signs have been taken, Baughn,<br />\nnoted and there has been some writing on<br />\nthe walls. \"I'm surprised that we don't<br />\nhave more than we do,\" said Baughn.<br />\nBaughn said that one important addition<br />\nto the library would be carpeting in the<br />\naisles. \"It's hard to study,\"said Baughn,<br />\n\"when a girl in high heels comes walking<br />\ndown the corridor making noise with each<br />\nstep\". Baughn was hopeful that this could<br />\nbe accomplished this year.<br />\nBaughn was emphatic about having<br />\n\"more communication with the students<br />\nabout what they do and do not want.\" He<br />\nwas pleased with the results of the suggestion box, but felt that there are many<br />\nareas which could be improved if only<br />\nthe librarian knew what the students desired. \"The students don't tell us what<br />\nthey want\", said Baughn, \"We could do<br />\nso much for them.\"<br />\nOne of the best aspects of the library,<br />\nBerthel stated, is its hours. \"I doubt if<br />\nthere is any library that has its entire<br />\ncollection open as many hours per day<br />\nas we are,\" he said. The library once<br />\nclosed at 5:00 p.m.<br />\nBerthal stated that regional cooperative efforts with library pools is the only<br />\nanswer to the needs of the University.<br />\n\"In this way,\" said Berthal, \"one<br />\nschool's needs can be filled by another<br />\nschool.\" Berthal sees Hopkins, Princeton, Maryland, and Pennsylvania, among<br />\nothers, working in a regional effort.<br />\nSo far no firm plans for cooperation have<br />\nbeen formulated.<br /><br />\nLibrary officials, announcing that there has been a drop<br />\njust been lucky\" and hopes the trend will continue.<br /><br />\nip Vadiso Ave<br /><br />\nin vandalism, noted \"we've<br />\nphoto by hoffmann<br /><br />\nCM<br /><br />\nCHOW<br />\n0<br /><br />\nHO<br />\nCN3<br /><br />\n,c04<br />\nC<br />\n'00 'CHI<br /><br />\nOur product is pharmaceutical<br />\nour business is people<br /><br />\n\"PUTNEY SWOPE\"<br />\nThe Truth and Soul Movie<br /><br />\nPremiere Wednesday!<br />\nIn tile Aar(of CliarlesVillve\u2014<br />\nTbe<br /><br />\nVtapijouge 1235-04301<br /><br />\nlig 25th at Charles<br /><br />\nIf you work for Syntex you're really in the people<br />\nbusiness.<br />\nOur products are revolutionary drugs and other<br />\npharmacological products created and marketed<br />\nespecially for the public's health and welfare.<br />\nOur scientists developed the first orally-active<br />\nprogestational agent which became a basic ingredient in several of the early oral contraceptives.

Last year, when<br />\nthe Constitution was modified, we established the screening committees in conjunction with the Council in order to<br />\nchoose members. As it turned out, the<br />\nCouncil is not competent enough to distinguish among qualified candidates those<br />\nwho will be best for the job. What this<br />\namendment does is cut out the needless<br />\naspect of the S.C. selection.<br /><br />\ntinuation of discussion of the controversy<br />\nsurrounding Steve Ross. Ross, who had<br />\napplied for a position on the Curriculum<br />\nStudy Committee, was overlooked in the<br />\nscreening committee's recommendations to the Council, because of \"various complications.\" Last week, he appealed to the Council for a reconsideration of his case.

This<br />\nconcern is based upon the assumption that<br />\nGoucher will join with other schools<br />\nacross the nation in a trend toward adsexes to previously<br />\nboth<br />\nmitting<br />\n\"unisexual\" institutions.<br /><br />\nFollowed JHU's Lead<br />\nOther factors contributed to the belief<br />\nthat a unification betweenthe two schools<br />\nwas in the making. Recently the students<br />\nand faculty of Goucher voted in favor of<br />\nswitching their school's calendar to a<br />\n4-1-4 system that is similar to one adopted by Hopkins last spring. The move by<br />\nGoucher involves far more in rearranging academic accredidation than the<br />\nchange at Hopkins because Goucher will<br />\nnot only have to change dates on its calendar but will also have to switch from a<br />\ntri=mester system to a semester plan.<br />\nThis acceptance of a calendar that<br />\ncould cause so many difficulties, so<br />\nshortly after the change at Hopkins, caused many observers to believe that itwas<br />\na step toward joining with Hopkins on a<br />\nmore formal basis.<br />\nAll of these theories could have been<br />\nrendered irrelevant before the Academic<br />\nCouncil move because of a report of the<br />\nGoucher Committee on the Future of the<br />\nCollege that was released at the start<br />\nof the present academic year. The report<br />\nis opposed to instituting coeducation at<br />\nGoucher, and thus would rule out any<br />\nplans for a merger between the two institutions.<br /><br />\nThe committee's report has met sharp<br />\nopposition on the Goucher campus from<br />\nboth faculty and students, but it stands<br />\nfirm as a proposed policy statement for<br />\nthe future of the college. Aspects of the,<br />\nsection concerning coeducation have<br />\ncome under fire from the Goucher New<br />\nUniversity Conference because of its<br />\n\"condescending attitude toward the position of a woman in society.\"<br />\nThe Board of Trustees,thefaculty,the<br />\nadministration, the Alumnae,and the student boyd were each represented by three<br />\nmembers on the committee. One representative from the Alumnae resigned<br />\nfrom the committee and was replaced by<br />\nEvelyn Schroedl, a member of the<br />\nGoucher class of 1962 and also assistant<br />\nregistrar of the college; thus the administration had added a representative<br />\nfrom their own ranks under the guise of<br />\nreplacing an alumna.<br /><br />\nA member of the committee claims<br />\nthat one of the administration representatives on the committee abstained<br />\nfrom voting on the section concerning<br />\ncoeducation. The other administration<br />\nmembers, and all of the trustee and<br />\nAlumnae representatives favored maintaining Goucher as an all women's<br />\nschool. Those opposed to the report included two faculty members and all three<br />\nstudents. One faculty member voted with<br />\nthose members of the committee that<br />\nwere appointed by President Perry.<br />\nReport Stands Firm<br />\nThe report presents arguments both<br />\nin favor and against coeducation, and<br />\nrecognizes aspects of college life that<br />\ncould be greatly enhanced by an integrated atmosphere. Although it is opposed to admitting men to the Goucher<br />\nstudent body it does suggest that means<br />\nof greater cooperation between Hopkins<br />\nand Goucher be explored.<br />\nThe committee points out that applications to women's colleges throughout the<br />\nnatio, including Goucher, have both declined in number and in quality. This has<br />\ncaused a severe financial problem for<br />\nGoucher--one that cannot be overlooked,<br />\nclaims the report.<br /><br />\nThe report claims that \"coeducation<br />\nis unlikely to offer much help in overcoming admissions problems\" should<br />\nthey get worse in the near future. It also<br />\nstates that a transition to a coeducational<br />\nsystem would be detrimentalfor perhaps<br />\nten to fifteen years because it would be<br />\n\"painful in that the men would not be as<br />\ndiversified as the women and probably<br />\nnot their academic equals.\"<br /><br />\nMen Cost More<br />\nTransition to coeducation at Goucher<br />\nwould be \"expensive in that extraordinary scholarship outlays,\" claims the<br />\nreport, \"would doubtless be required to<br />\nattract the best of the men applying.\" No<br />\nexplanation is given as to why any more<br />\nwould have to be allocated to<br />\nmoney<br />\nattract men than is now devoted to getting good female students to attend the<br />\nschool.<br /><br />\nAmong the arguments in the report in<br />\nfavor of coeducation is that \"men distinguish themselves from womer by having a greater propensityto debate, question and critically appraise the subject<br />\nmatter of the academic disciplines.\"<br />\nWomen in a unisexual school tend to be<br />\n\"more meticulous in learning subject<br />\nmatter,\" says the report. It goes on to<br />\nexplain that the integration of these two<br />\ntendencies could give the student a<br />\n\"wider academic experience and permit<br />\nher to appreciate the many dimensions<br />\nof scholarly activities.\"<br />\nThe counter-argument to this point of<br />\nview is that the presence of the \"aggressive, questioning approach of male students will inevitably hamper the female<br />\nstudent from eveloping her own critical<br />\nskills.\"<br /><br />\nDiversify or Regulate?<br /><br />\nThe proponent view of coeducationthat<br />\nis presented in the report states that it<br />\nwill broaden course selections and add<br />\n,diversity in academic interests of the<br />\n\"<br />\nstudent boyd.\" Opponents to this idea<br />\nclaim that \"in light of woman's existing<br />\nand potential role in society, it is essential to have an academic program<br />\ngeared to her particular needs.\"<br /><br />\nThis theory is in direct opposition to<br />\nmany precepts set forth by advocates of<br />\nwomen's liberation and has caused a<br />\ngreat deal of criticism to come from the<br />\npredominantly female New University<br />\nConference chapter at Goucher. The<br />\nchapter has taken a stand in favor of<br />\ncoeducation but has not, as yet, released<br />\nany response to the committee's report.<br />\nIndividual members of the NUC have<br />\nclaimed that \"this aspect of the report<br />\nis diametrically opposed to our stands<br />\nand this sort of thinking is exactly what<br />\nwe are fighting against.\"<br />\nThose in favor of coeducation, according to the report, feel that the introduction of men to an all girls campus would<br />\nimprove on academic dialogue outside of<br /><br />\nthe classroom situation.

The<br />\nincident was not exceptional in any respect, neither by the cleverness of<br />\nthe jeers nor by the Senator's reactions, nor by the effect upon the audience. Not even Senator Mansfield's public apologies were exceptional; the<br />\nSenate merely happens to be the scene of more subtle forms of discourtesy.<br />\n.The hecklers can take a certain amount of pride in the fact that Hopkins<br />\ndid manage to make the back page of the Sun because of the disturbance,<br />\nsomething which could conceivably be brought up when discussions<br />\nconcerning Columbia, Harvard and Cornell arise.<br />\nThe trouble with heckling is that it is a dead end. A clever speaker, like<br />\nGeorge Wallace, can embarrass hecklers and win over an audience by<br />\nturning either the rudeness or the actual statements of his opponents against them and to his own advantage. A less imaginative speaker, like Senator<br />\nStennis, can gain the sympathy of the audience merely by playing the<br />\nmartyr. In this case, the Senator received hearty applause from an essential antagonistic audience. All he had to do was to read his prepared<br />\nspeech.<br />\nThe other aspect of heckling is that it is annoying even to those who<br />\ntend to sympathize with the ultimate aims of the hecklers. It is a clear<br />\ninsult to the intelligence and perceptiveness of the listener. The heckler<br />\nmakes the assumption that those around him cannot judge for themselves<br />\nwhat to accept and what to reject in a_ speech. Are we to assume that<br />\nevery statement that was not followed by a cry of \"Bullshit!\" or some<br />\nother comment is true, and fit for our ears?<br />\nIt is quite clear that heckling has increased recently in response to the<br />\nfact that the \"silent majority\" controls the nation and that its leaders<br />\nrefuse to consider other opinions. There has been, however, no indication<br />\nthat heckling has achieved even one of its goals.<br /><br />\nSell it again, Dick<br />\nAfter the widespread participation in the October Moratorium activities,<br />\nmany people were reluctant to begin planning for the November two-day<br />\nmoratorium and the subsequent march. The announcement that President<br />\nNixon would make a television address suspended planning and postponed<br />\ndecisions. The hope was that Nixon would announce a major shift in U.S.<br />\npolicy\u2014that the November moratorium would prove unnecessary.<br />\nThe nation waited for the Nixon administration to take action on Viet<br />\nNam for the better part of a year. Nixon has now asked the nation to wait<br />\nlonger. The \"silent majority\" to whom he caters will probably allow him<br />\n\u2022OW<br />\nNoT<br /><br />\nMO,TM<br />\nMor<br /><br />\nAkV IF<br />\nyou KISS<br /><br />\nHe Lat.<br />\nIM<br />\nFORA<br />\nTCWIFIG<br />\nSOKRISC<br /><br />\nYOU MEA LOLL<br />\n-rya) imp A<br />\nPRit\\JCE .<br /><br />\nas much time as he asks. But those who are dissatisfied with \u2022 the administration's policy will not wait indefinitely. Nixon will find that with each<br />\nmonth he is \"given\" his critics will become stronger and more numerous\u2014<br />\nunless the U.S. is out of Viet Nam.<br />\nThe second appeal was for a self-imposed curb on dissent. Those who<br />\ndemonstrate, according to Nixon, only weaken the U. S. position in<br />\nnegotiations. This argument has been heard many times before. The<br />\nargument is based on the myth that the North Viet Namese would scurry<br />\nback home to their rice paddies if presented with a united front from<br />\nAmerica.<br />\nFinally, Nixon appealed for a free hand in obtaining a peace. Mc has a<br />\ntimetable for troop withdrawals but will not announce it(Remember his<br />\nplan for ending the war which he would not announce during the campaign?) The timetable depends on estimates of battlefield activity and the<br />\nprogress in \"Vietnamizing\" the war. Nixon is the one who will decide<br />\nwhen sufficient \"Vietnamization\" has taken place and when the battle-,<br />\nfield activity has dropped enough to permit more withdrawals. Acting as<br />\nCommander in Chief of the Armed Forces, on the basis of his own estimates, Nixon will be free to do whatever he likes with the troop strength.<br />\nHis position will be analogous to Johnson's after the Gulf of Tonkin<br />\nResolution.<br />\nThese appeals must be denied. Nixon must see in November that time is<br />\nrunning out, that he cannot silence dissent by saying it 'looks bad,' and<br />\nthat his every move will be watched by those who are not willing to give<br />\nhim a blank check. Those who waited for the President's speech before<br />\ncommitting themselves to action should now begin to act; those who hoped to sit back and let Nixon get the U.S. out of Viet Nam had best look to<br />\nother means; and those who are waiting for the North Viet Namese to give<br />\nup the fight and go home-had best not hold their breath.<br /><br />\nA PPNCE?<br /><br />\nWHAT<br />\nKIMP OF<br />\nSORPOSe<br />\nIS A<br /><br />\npascE?<br /><br />\nA MG<br /><br />\nFRIWEr<br />\nKING?<br /><br />\nWELL,IF<br /><br />\nVOU06<br />\n1,A1N,<br /><br />\nKft,t,(111AT Is (1?<br /><br />\nWTA<br /><br />\np)(14cE OR A<br /><br />\n7A1-1(1k6<br />\nAE3007-<br /><br />\nSURPRIS6!<br /><br />\n50t4E SORPPISE.<br /><br />\nPublishers-Hall Syndicate<br /><br />\nM<br />\nRfAt.t.ce<br />\nA FROG,<br /><br />\n\"We are moving with all possible speed toward the war's conclusion.\"<br /><br />\n\\<br /><br />\nPAGE 12<br /><br />\nNov. 7, 1969<br /><br />\nNEWS\u2014LETTER<br /><br />\nfeatures<br />\nRecords<br /><br />\nrkimulation Provides Stimulation<br />\nThe past few years have seen a fair number of electronic music recordings released but few, if any,which have<br />\nhad mass appeal. Switched-On Bach was a success in<br />\nthe sales department but it probably did not start many<br />\npeople thinking of electronic music as a legitimate form.<br />\nThe problem with electronically produced sounds has<br />\nbeen finding their place in the current musical scene. One<br />\napproach, on which the Bach is a variation, has been to<br />\ncombine the synthetic sounds with some established<br />\nmusical style. The ill-fated \"United States of America<br />\nRock Band\" used electronic sounds for ornamentation<br />\nbut as such they could not successfully brace the group's<br />\ngenerally limp sound.<br />\nThe composers who have looked uponelectronic sounds<br />\nas a new branch of the classical music tradition have<br />\ngenerally been too absorbed in mathematical, random,or<br />\nabsurdist composition to win a large audience. One whose<br />\napproach has been exceptional at times is Henri Pousseur<br />\nwhose \"Trois Visages de Liege,\" written for the Brussel's World's Fair in forty-channel stereo, was released<br />\nin two-channel stereo by Columbia several years ago<br />\n(MS 7051). It is a fine piece of electronic program<br />\nmusic which describes a day in the life of a city. However, the commonplace nature of the subject matter and<br /><br />\nthe images it geneates limit its appeal.<br />\nAs it is, someone else has found the right materal for<br />\nthe snythesizer and has done the right things with it. He<br />\nis Douglas Leedy and his album is called The Electric<br />\nZodiac (Capitol ST-368). Leedy is a faculty member of<br />\nthe music staff at UCLA and founder of the tlectronic<br />\nmusic studio there. He has also studied under men like<br />\nLukas Foss and plays horn professionally. He cannot<br />\nbe easily placed in the pop establishment. He has, however, created what could be a successful electronic pop<br />\nalbum.<br />\nFor the recording he used both the Moog and Buchla<br />\nsynthesizers, which are similar, and anOgnob generator,<br />\nwhich is described on the liner notes. The sides are not<br />\nnumbered because in the<br />\nElectric Zodiac \"thereisnobeginningnoendnesidenoeside two.\"<br />\nOne side begins with a heartbeat towhich is gradually<br /><br />\nsound itself cracks under the strain and begins to wobble<br />\naimlessly and out of its element from one channel to the<br />\nother. Not until the cries subside does it once again become a gentle undercurrent.<br />\nThe other side begins with a sound like the engines of<br />\na cruising jet heard from inside the plane. Added to this<br />\nis a radar blip that sways back and forth from channel to<br />\nchannel and is unremarkable at first but which changes<br />\nalmost imperceptibly into an hysterical squeak. There<br />\nare more voice-like sounds on this side but they sound<br />\nlike announcements made over a booming public address<br />\nsystem with the difference that the sounds are not words,<br />\njust mechanical noises. The remainder of the side is<br />\ncomposed of a quiet hum which is pierced by a variety<br />\nof widely-spaced loud noises. But at the end of the hum<br />\nis all that is left.<br /><br />\nadded various popping sounds. It builds upto an unhinged<br />\nclimax and fades not sounding like an Emmet Till automobile. disappearing over the horizon. A gently fluctuating low-pitched tone takes over and lulls the listener into<br />\na trance-like state.

The Barnstormers have once again<br />\nproduced a fine play without the talent<br />\nto back it up (remember Murder in the<br />\nCathedral and Rhinocerous?) Not that<br />\nthere were no good performances turned<br />\nIn last Saturday night, there were. But<br />\nthe entire production left me wondering<br />\nwhether the play had ever been rehearsed<br />\nfrom start to finish..<br />\nFor lack of continuity was Saturday<br />\nnight's worst blunder. Some scenes<br />\nworked and others fell hopelessly flat.<br />\nI walked out at the end of the performance with no feeling of having had a play,<br />\nmove through me and create a change.<br />\nThe play is lengthy, and this began to<br />\nbe obvious as more and more moments<br />\nlost their effectiveness. Let me list a<br />\nfew of them for mere perversity's sake:<br />\nThe churchyard scene (1.3) is one which<br />\nis highly important to the play. I had a<br />\nfeeling of Musgrave's power, but not that<br />\nhis men were under it. The sight of Rob<br />\nGoolrick tensing his muscles is not<br />\nenough to make me think of a tortured<br />\nman. I am sorry to say that Mitchell<br />\nFrank as Sparky was not in the least<br />\nconvincing. This was mostly due to his<br />\nlack of stage presence, but his lack of<br />\naccent and emotional shading also contributed. The part of the Mayor should<br />\nbe played by a strong actor with a good<br />\nsense of borgeois ownership, and Jack<br />\nGoodman could not convey that quality to<br />\nthe audience.<br /><br />\nGoolrick's Locks<br />\nI could go on, but to what purpose?<br />\nLet me ask some rhetorical questions<br />\nwhich will give you some sense of last<br />\nSaturday night's performance: Why did I<br />\nhave no feeling at all of the forces which<br />\ndrove Sgt. Musgrave? Why did I not feel<br />\nlike a crowd in a marketplace when the<br />\nactors obviously thought I was a crowd<br />\nand started to wave bayonets in my face?<br />\nWhy did I laught when Annie suddenly<br />\ncrying in the stable scene? Why was the<br />\naudience left with that lovely little stage<br />\npicture at the end? What was it for? And<br />\n(this last one is a trifle frivolous): Why<br />\nwasn't Rob Goolrick's hair cut? Fully<br />\nhalf of his dramatic gestures consisted in<br />\nraising his right hand to brush his face<br />\nclear of lovely layered gobs of hair.<br />\nThere are two very overt problems in<br />\nthe script itself, and the way they were<br />\nhandled says a little about the director,<br />\nPaul Hjelmervick, who Was hired by the<br /><br />\nBarnstormers for this production. The<br />\nfirst of these problems consists of the<br />\nNorthern English accents which John<br />\nArden wrote into the play. Now, in my<br />\nbook, one does one of two things with<br />\naccents: either one does them all, or<br />\nnone at all(and one hopes to get away with<br />\nit). The result is typically Barnstomer-some characters had accents (Attercliffe, Bludgeon, The Pugnacious Collier,<br />\nThe Parson, and sometimes Mrs.Hitchcock and Sergeant Musgrave); others<br />\ndidn't (the rest of the cast, most notably<br />\nSparky and Walsh). The result was almost laughable.<br />\nThe second problem is that there are<br />\nsongs throughout the play. When I read<br />\nthe script, it seemed clear to me that<br />\nthe songs were an integral part of the<br />\naction, and not inserted a la Brecht, as<br />\nstop-gaps. But by and large the actors<br />\nseemed self-conscious of their a capella<br />\nsinging (as well they might have been-the<br />\nresult was only slightly melodic, and my<br />\nears were offended as John Arden never<br />\nintended them to be); the end result was<br /><br />\nthat the actors would slip out and into<br />\ncharacter with the beginnings and ends<br />\nof the songs.<br /><br />\nHjelmervick \"The Best\"<br />\nBut on the whole, Hjelmervick's<br />\ndirecting job was well done, when one<br />\nconsiders the complexities of the script<br />\nand the simplicities of his actors. I felt<br />\nthat many of the scenes were perhaps a<br />\nbit overplayed for dramatic highpoints,<br />\nand Mr.Hjelmervick could have held back<br />\non some of the more stagey blockingthat<br />\nhe ocassionally resorted to, but with<br />\nthese two exceptions, he is easily the<br />\nbest director the Barnstormers have had<br />\nworking for them in three years that I<br />\nhave been attending Barnstormer productions.<br />\nAs far as the acting goes, the award<br />\nfor \"most effective\" is divided between<br />\nPhil Wiehe (Bludgeon) and Alan Niedermayer (Pugnacious Collier) who failed to<br />\nremind me that I was viewing an amateur<br />\nproduction. Bruce Robinson,<br />\nEllen<br />\nFraites, Rob Goolrick, and<br />\nDavid<br /><br />\nWilliams all turned in creditable performance of Sgt. Musgrave more than a<br />\nproducer's dream.<br />\nDan Sheer, in the title role, lacked<br />\nthe kind of depth which one expects in a<br />\nleading man, and one had no idea of the<br />\ndifferent forces driving Musgrave(this is<br />\nperhaps more a problem of direction<br />\nrather than acting). One also had the distinct impression that, for Sheer,emotion<br />\nequalled volume, and the audience was<br />\ntreated to much of the latter without<br />\nmuch sense of the former (I left with a<br />\nsplitting headache).<br />\nAlan Trumpler again turned out a fine<br />\nset (I have nothing but admiration for<br />\nsomeone who can devise six sets and<br />\nchange them rapidly in the Barn, for<br />\nChrist's sake).I wish more Goucher girls<br />\nwould come out for acting, rather than<br />\nscene-changing. Doug Paul and Stan<br />\nMetelits did an overly dramatic and<br />\nslightly repetitive job of lighting, but this<br />\ncould be excused by a) director's prerogative, and b) working in the Barn.<br /><br />\nStuart Wattles<br /><br />\nBooks<br /><br />\nBarthelme<br />\nDonald Barthelme audaciously thrust<br />\nhimself upon the literary world in 1967<br />\nwith a funny, witty book entitled Snow<br />\nWhite. Snow White was a modern version of the traditional fairy tale, but definitely not a tale about fairies. The book<br />\nhas even made the reading list for one<br />\nof Dr. Macksey's humanities courses<br />\nthis semester. With a high camp style<br />\nand a lcnowingwink to the \"sophisticates\",<br />\nBarthelme managed to somehow get away<br />\nwith a story in which the heroine, Snow<br />\nWhite, was raped/gang banged by the<br />\nseven dwarfs in the midst of her hot<br />\nshower.<br /><br />\nEggplant Eats Daley<br />\nPractices, Unnatural<br />\nUnspeakable<br />\nActs (Farrar, Straus and Giroux, New<br />\nYork, 1968) is Barthelme's second book.<br />\nIn effect, the nifty title hides the scruffy<br />\ncollection of fifteen of Barthelme's stories (episodes), most of which appeared<br />\npreviously in the New Yorker and other<br />\nmagazines. Bringing these stories together in one volume does have mercenary<br />\novertones but so be it. The prospect of<br />\nroyalty money in no way influences the<br />\nauthor's poor quality of writing.<br /><br />\nBawdy Boredom'<br /><br />\nEach episode has some witty catch to<br />\nIt, some gimmick to hold together an<br />\notherwise absurd little narrative which<br />\nthreatens to float away in literary extravaganza. Little things like a would-be<br />\nwriter with an eight foot son who wears<br />\na serape made of transitor radios, all<br />\nturned on and tuned to different stations.<br />\nOr a balloon which when inflated covers<br />\nan entire city. Barthelme might as well<br />\nhave included the eggplant that ate Chicago.<br /><br />\nStatic and Flat<br />\nActually, \"The Balloon\" is the best<br />\nof the lot. The author's conclusions (if<br />\nwe want to call them that) strike more<br />\nresonant chords in the reader in this<br />\nstory than in any of the other pieces;<br />\n\"It was suggested that whatwas admired<br />\nabout the balloon was finally this: that it<br />\nwas not limited, or defined;\" and \"As a<br />\nsingle balloon must stand for a lifetime<br />\nof thinking about balloons,so each citizen<br />\nexpressed, in the attitude he chose, a<br />\ncomplex of attitudes.\" The balloonwhich<br />\nusurps the position of the sky carries a<br />\ndeeper, connotative meaning (s).Conclu-<br /><br />\nsions may not be the proper word, but at<br />\nleast the episode works.<br />\nThe problem with the other \"slices of<br />\nlife as we don't know them\" is just that:<br />\nthey are absurd and outside any frame of<br />\nreference. There is no respondant feeling from the reader.\"A Few Moments of<br />\nSleeping and Waking\",about a man's continuous interpretation of his girlfriend's<br />\ndreams is a real life situatio, but Barthelme adds nothing to that situation. It<br />\nstands static and therefore the episode<br />\nfalls flat.<br />\nUnspeakable Pracitces, Unnatural Acts<br />\nis light reading. There is little strainon<br />\none's vocabulary if he fashions himself<br />\nas a quatrasyllabic intellectual. But for<br />\nthis reviewer it is light reading because<br />\nthere is nothing substantial in it. The<br />\nbook is a tour de force of camp art,<br />\nwhich is fast falling (by the grace of the<br />\ngreat god Browning) from the literary<br />\nlimelight. Barthelme says it all in the<br />\nopening line of the last story \"See the<br />\nMoon?\": \"I know you think I'm wasting<br />\nmy time.\" You're right, Mr.Barthelme,<br />\nand you're wasting my time too.<br /><br />\nMark A msler<br /><br />\nNov. 7, 1969<br /><br />\nPAGE 13<br /><br />\nNEWS\u2014LETTER<br /><br />\n\"mom Our American Heritage<br /><br />\nRadical Right Republicans Reject Parker<br />\nThe careful reader has doubtless<br />\nnoticed that a good deal of the Alton B.<br />\nParker<br />\ncampaign was fashioned to<br />\nwinnow conservative Republicans from<br />\nthe cause of President Roosevelt. In<br />\norder to examine Parker's prospects, it<br />\nis necessary to appreciate that there had<br />\nbeen two significant intra-party revolts<br />\nagainst Republican candidates since the<br />\nParty's formation in 1854.<br />\nPrior to the Grant administration, it is<br />\nsafet to say that dissent among Republicans was kept within narrow limits; even<br />\nthose who criticized Lincoln during the<br />\nCivil War did not suggest that the Democrats offered a viable<br />\nalternative.<br />\nLincoln's most conspicuous critics in his<br />\nParty numbered such substantial gentlemen as Charles Sumner, Benjamin Wade<br />\nand Horace Greeley; however,<br />\ntheir<br />\nin<br />\ncriticism of Lincoln's lack of vigor<br />\nPursuing the Civil War cannot possibly be<br />\nconstrued as an appeal to the Democrats,<br />\nWhose famous 1864 platform stated that<br />\nLincoln's war measures were overly<br />\nvindictive and detrimental to<br />\ncivil<br />\nliberties.<br /><br />\nMartyr and Pestilence<br />\nLincoln's assassination gave the Republicans a martyr and as the Christians<br />\nfound several thousand years before,the<br />\naura of martyrdom is an effective force<br />\nin solidifying an organization. There is a<br />\nWhole catalogue of sermons and editorials indicating that the Republicans,those<br />\ninheritors of the virtue of the saintly<br />\nLincoln, must be considered as monopolizing political intelligence and virture. A<br />\ndevotion to the Republican party so virulent and narrow-minded as to appear a<br />\nself-caricature<br />\ncharacterized<br />\nsuch<br />\nranking intellectuals as James Russell<br />\nLowell and William Dean Howells.<br />\nThe Grant administration, however,<br />\nspawned such improprieties as to disaffect a few Republicans whose devotion to<br />\nthe party occupied only reasonable limits. Space is lacking to recount precisely the misdeeds of Federal officials; presumably everyone has some knowledge.It<br />\nis most important to assert that those<br />\nalienated by Grant were not typical RePublicans.

McClure, Whitelaw Reid and the eventual<br />\nLiberal Republican nominee, Horace<br />\nGreeley.<br />\nThe Greeley campaign was embarrassingly unsuccessful. Although<br />\nthe<br />\nDemocrats accepted the Greeley candidacy, dissidents could recall Greeley's<br />\nscathing attacks on the character of their<br />\nparty. In some strongly Democratic<br />\nareas, there was a disappointing turnout<br />\non Election Day. Greeley also suffered<br />\nfrom his lack of credibility as a potential<br />\nexecutive officer, and above all from the<br />\nfact that those offended by Grant corruption had chronically overestimated their<br />\nnumbers.<br /><br />\nin a<br /><br />\nThe Untouchables<br />\nIn the Nineteenth Century, French and<br />\nEnglish reviews frequently comment that<br />\npolitics in America is not a leisurely<br />\nactivity for gentlemen, such as we might<br />\nfind in the House of Lords; instead it is<br />\n. entered into as a full time profession, and<br />\nmen in America who are below<br />\nthe<br />\nhighest intellectual and social class enter<br />\npolitics to serve themselves,rather than<br />\nthe public welfare. This is largely true,<br />\nalthough I have oversimplified the argument. However, there was also a class of<br />\nwonderfully disinterested<br />\npoliticans<br />\nwho possessed<br />\nnotable<br />\nintellectual<br />\npower, were quite conscious of<br />\ntheir<br />\nsuperiority, and meant it when they declared they held country above party.<br />\nFrom these men, who generally<br />\ncould<br />\nafford party wrath because of their insources of income, was<br />\ndependent<br />\nmustered the leadership of the Liberal<br />\nRepublicans who opposed Grant.<br />\nThere was Carl Schurz, a German refugee with the marvelous ability towrite<br />\nequally well in two languages.

Above all he had been a<br />\nzealous publicist whose reputation was<br />\nfreely exploited by Republicans desiring'<br />\nGerman votes.

After Blaine's<br />\nnomination,<br />\nRepublican dissent was<br />\nspearheaded by Schurz and Storey, and<br />\nothers who had generally been sympathetic to the previous bolt of 1872.<br />\nThis time the results were happier.<br />\nCleveland had sufficient stature as areformer to appeal to dissident Republicans, but he lacked Greeley's propensity<br />\nfor alienating Democrats. Moreover,<br />\nBlaine was facing a powerful sentiment<br />\nfor change which had only narrowly been<br />\nwithstood in the two previous Presidential elections. There are myriad complicating factors in the 1884 contest, and<br />\nit may be necessary to emphasize that,<br />\nas in 1872,the party bolt was numerically<br /><br />\nsmall. Nevertheless, any Presidential<br />\ncandidate would benefit by receiving as<br />\nmuch support in the opposite party as<br />\ndid Cleveland in 1884.<br />\nIt is necessary to emphasize that the<br />\nsource of these disaffections was nothing<br />\nless than a convictionthatthe Republican<br />\ncandidate was morally objectionable.The<br />\nRepublicans did not suffer desertions because of policy disagreements with their<br />\ncandidates, even if these dtsagreements<br />\nwere of major significance. President<br />\nMcKinley's imperialist policy was criticized by several intellectual Republicans, among them Schurz and Storey,and<br />\nalso Dr.Charles William Eliot,the publicist and President of Harvard University.<br />\nIn the campaign of 1900, William Jennings<br />\nBryan strove mightily for the support of<br />\ndissident Republicans as he criticized<br />\nimperialism at great length. However,<br />\nthere was no notable Republican support<br />\nof Bryan.<br /><br />\nThe Morals Story<br />\nIn 1904, Parker was handicapped by<br />\nthe fact that President Rocisevelt,though<br />\ncontroversial in certain positions, had<br />\nshown no taint of moral opprobrium.<br />\nThe Democratic press made some desperate efforts to morally impugn Roosebelt. For example, there were suggesCortelyou was<br />\ntions that George<br />\nreceiving campaign funds from corporations in return for a promise not to<br />\nprosecute under anti-trust statutes. This<br />\nwas never convincingly substantiated.<br />\nSchurz and Storey, aging men by now<br />\nconsidered personifications of party irregularity, did greet Parker at campaign<br />\nfunctions, thus implicitly pledging support. But Schurz and Storey were long<br />\nout of the political mainstream,and their<br />\npolitical power was gone. Parker received virtually no support from younger<br />\nRepublicans, who had no reason to see<br />\nParker as morally objectionable. Nor<br />\ndid he have an issue as interesting as<br />\nfree silver, which had caused a few<br />\nagrarian Republicans to rally to the<br />\nDemocrats in 1896. As we shall see, the<br />\nlast significant episode of the Parker<br />\ncampaign was a desperate attempt to<br />\nprove that Roosevelt was in fact corruptible.<br /><br />\nEd Mendelsohn<br /><br />\nComplete Bachelor<br />\nService<br />\nWAVERLY LAUNDROMAT<br /><br />\nMENU<br /><br />\nAllegheny Airlines<br />\nhelps you beat<br />\nthe waiting game...<br />\nAnd saves you up to 331/3 To.<br />\nAllegheny's Young Adult Card lets you fly<br />\nwhenever you want to (even holidays)<br />\nand still get advance reservations.<br />\nIf you're between 12 and 22,<br />\nwhat are you waiting for?<br />\nStop by any Allegheny ticket<br />\ncounter and purchase your<br />\nYoung Adult Card.<br /><br />\nSUMS<br />\nMANY KINDS<br />\nPIZZA<br />\nKANT KaIDS<br />\nSPAGHETTI<br />\nHOME MAN<br />\nCHICKEN WITH'RENO FRIES<br />\nAND INGUSN MUffIN<br /><br />\nThe Very Best<br />\nHARRY LITTLE<br />\nCarry Out Shops<br />\n32nd near Greinunennt<br />\n25th near Gramm/it<br /><br />\n330 GREENMOUNTAVF<br />\n467-2123<br /><br />\nProgram of Sacred<br />\nMusic And Poetry<br />\nSunday, November 16. 1969<br />\n5:00 P.M.<br />\nUniversity<br />\nBaptist Church<br />\nCharles and Thirty-fourth Streets<br /><br />\nHOBELMANN MOTORS<br />\nINC<br />\nAUTHORIZED VOLKSWAGEN DEALER<br />\nDOWNTOWN<br />\nMAY WE SERVE YOU?<br />\nSALES - SERVICE - PARTS - BODY SHOP - USED CARS<br />\nVOLKSWAGEN INSURANCE<br />\nFree Courtesy Bus - Downtown<br />\nSaks Dept.

He took a far more general line<br />\nthan the other two, avoiding the mathematical logic of Brennen's argument, and<br />\nthe military technicality of Rothstein's.<br />\nClaiming that the U.S. and the Soviet<br />\nUnion have had virtual military equality<br />\nfor the past several years, he maintained<br />\n\"nuclear weapons shouldn't even<br />\nbe<br />\ncalled weapons gince they are not appropriate weapons of national policy. They<br />\nare weapons of genocide and suicide.\"<br />\nThe<br />\nthreat of nuclear war is an<br />\nirrational one, he continued, since the<br />\nmethods used bear no relation to<br />\nthe<br />\npolitical realities which call for their<br />\nuse. Using Berlin as an example, he<br />\nnoted that the entire city would be destroyed no matter what the outcome<br />\nof<br />\nthe ensuing war would be.<br />\nMorgenthau also ridiculed the idea of<br />\namassing huge stockpiles on the theory<br />\nthat one must remain ahead of the other<br />\nside. \"It doesn't matter how many stockpiles are left after a war. It is a matter<br />\nfor archaeologists....\"<br />\nMorgenthau, who was at one time Dr.<br />\nRothstein's<br />\nteacher at<br />\nChicago,<br />\ninterspersed his accurate observations<br />\nwith wry commetns. Criticisingthe ABM<br />\non the grounds that a system<br />\nwhich<br />\nscreens out as many as 90% of oncoming<br />\nmissiles and still lets the rest through is<br />\nas useless as no screen at all, he added,<br />\n\"You're remains may be somewhat less<br />\nradioactive....\"<br />\nOn the panelists' second time around,<br />\nthe areas in which they differed narrowed<br />\nappreciably, and points which each was<br />\nadvocating became less clear. Rothstein<br />\nadmitted to Morgenthau that in effect the<br />\nRussians had had equality, as far as U.S.<br />\npolicy was concerned, for the past few<br />\nyears, and Morgenthau agreed that, technically, they were reaching our level of<br />\ndevelopment only now. Brennen admitted<br />\nto both that though McNamara was still<br />\nhis most highly-rated Secretary of De-<br /><br />\nDr. Morgenthau and one of his former pupils, Dr. Robert Rothstein,<br />\ndiscuss the implications of world-wide U.S. cold war- involvement.<br />\nfense, he had made many mistakes<br />\nduring his years in Washington.<br />\nRothstein further conceded that Brennen may be right ideally, but that our defense policy continues to be carried on<br />\nspasmodically and reflexively<br />\nrather<br />\nthan politically. He spoofed proponents<br />\nof the ABM on the grounds that theywere<br />\nadvocating the costly construction<br />\nof<br />\nsomething<br />\nwhich the Russians had<br />\nalready found to be non-functional. \"We<br />\nare always promising security on the<br />\nnext level up,\" he maintained.<br />\nBrennen, although repeatedly arguing<br />\nwith Rothstein over specifics, stated that<br />\nhis major dispute was with Morgenthau.<br />\n\"The argument that nucleaf weapons are<br />\ntoo murderous to use rationally does not<br />\nhold historically,\" he claimed, mentioning that similar statements had been<br />\nmade for the long bow, dynamite, poison<br />\ngasses, and aerial bombardment. \"Furthermore, neither side has ten-fold<br />\noverkill. We may have saturation, in<br />\nwhich case, a 10% screen would, as I<br />\nsaid, save 80 million lives.\"<br /><br />\nSENIORS<br />\nGRADUATE SCHOOL INTERVIEWS<br />\nMONDAY, NOVEMBER 10 - New York University Law<br />\nSchool<br />\nWEDNESDAY, NOVEMBER 12 - Columbia Business<br />\nSchool<br />\nTHURSDAY, NOVEMBER 13 - University of Maryland<br />\nSchool of Social Work<br />\nFRIDAY, NOVEMBER 14 - Columbia Law School<br />\nWEDNESDAY, NOVEMBER 19 - Dartmouth - Amos<br />\nTuck Business Admstrn.<br />\nTHURSDAY, NOVEMBER 20 - University of Michigan<br />\nBusiness Admstrn.<br />\nWEDNESDAY, DECEMBER 3 - Boston University Law<br />\nSchool<br />\nSIGN UP FOR INTERVIEWS IN PLACEMENT BUREAU,<br />\n100 WHITEHEAD HALL<br /><br />\nLiberal Arts Majors Interested in Employment with<br />\nNational Security Agency should file application by November 21 to take exam on December 6.<br />\nGraduate students and seniors in non-science fields who<br />\nare interested in government careers should take the<br />\nFederal Service entrance exam early in the academic year.<br />\nExams are given monthly through May.<br />\nApplications for these exams available in placement<br />\nbureau.<br />\nGraduate students and seniors (planning to go to grad<br />\nschool) in Engineering, Math, Physics, and Chemistry<br />\nwho are interested in summer employment should register<br />\nimmediately at placement bureau.<br />\nnt;6:17.26,4<br /><br />\nDR.

The thirteen<br />\n\"Motherfuckers\" present led in the chanting of \"Sieg<br />\nHeil.\"<br />\nThe leaflet distributed by SDS attacked Stennis for<br />\nhis support of \"the ABM system, the MIRV Ballistic<br />\nMissile System...and the development of fast deployment vessels\" to be used in quick U.S. interventions.<br />\nNoting that these vessels are being built in Mississippi<br />\nshipyards under a $130 million contract, the leaflet<br />\nquestioned whether Senator Stennis' chairmanship \"had<br />\nanything to do withe Mississippi location of the contract.\"<br />\nBut To Disrupt<br />\nSDS leaders felt that they undertook a \"combined action linking Stennis with racism and imperialism\" and<br />\nnoted that \"there was a tremendous amount of audience<br />\nParticipation in hasslingStennis.\" AnSDS spokesmanfelt<br />\nthat when \"people like Mansfield and Tydings defend a<br />\nblatant racist and fascist like Stennis, this shows where<br />\ntheir true interests lie.\"<br />\nThe letters sent by Symposium leaders, observed one<br />\nParticipant in the demonstration, \"place them on the side<br />\nof Stennis. They're expressing more concern over a few<br />\ndiscourteous interruptions than discourtesies to black<br />\npeople in Mississippi and around the country and to<br />\nVietnamese people and American souldiers.\"<br />\nRobert Bilgrave, Director of Student Affairs \"deplored the interruptions to Senator Stennis' talk and language used.\" While no disciplinary action will be taken,<br />\nBilgrave expressed the interntion of recommendingto the<br />\nCommittee on Student Affairs that it consider a policy<br />\nregarding treatment of visitors on campus.<br />\ngenerally condemned<br />\nAt a Tuesday luncheon, attended by student leaders<br /><br />\nadministration personnel and Dr. Gordon, the treatment<br />\naccorded Senator Stennis was generally condemned.<br />\nThe eight students and five administrators present<br />\nagreed that the heckling served no purpose and reflected<br />\nbadly on the university. However,there was disagreement<br />\nover the steps which should be taken to prevent such<br />\nincidents from recurring.<br />\nThe Sunpapers sharply attacked the reception given<br />\nStennis in a Tuesday morning editorial. The only thing<br />\ndisrupters achieved, according to the editorial, \"was<br />\nwhatever cheap thrill comes with self-righteous arrogance....On any similar occasion we suggest they would<br />\nbe wholly justified in removing such disrupters physically.\"<br />\nSenator Mansfield stressed the lack of courtesy<br />\nshown to Senator Stennis. With courtesy on both sides, he<br />\nobserved, \"I think we would be less likely to resort to<br />\nviolence, epithets, neme-calling and other forms of<br />\nabuse which do none of us any good and, in fact, do this<br />\nnation great harm.\"<br /><br />\nMississippi Senator John Stennis ignored the costumed<br />\nstudents below him and outlined his views on how \"America must develop policies and precedents to accomplish arms limitation while keeping the balance of<br />\npower in the hands of peace-loving nations.\"<br />\n\"There is no such thing as total disarmament\u2014it is<br />\nnot going to happen in our time,\" he noted. Someone<br />\nshouted \"not while your _in power!\" \"To the extent<br />\nthat the United States can reduce arms without incurring<br />\nthe danger of aggression I favor gradual disarmament,\"<br />\nthe Senator continued.<br />\nStennis, who became a member of the Senate in<br />\n1948, felt that the \"requirement for military strength<br />\nsufficient to deter and repel aggression is equally important to the meeting of our domestic needs.\" This<br />\nstatement was greeted with shouts of \"shame!\"<br />\nAny negotiations toward arms limitation \"must be<br />\ncommenced from as strong a position as possible.\"<br />\nStennis labelled the arms limitation talks, which are<br />\nscheduled to begin this month in Helsinki, \"a potential<br />\nturning point in histroy.\"<br />\nBut he stressed the need<br />\nfor caution since \"the history of past association with<br />\nRussia offers no basis for optimism.\"<br /><br />\nFree Speech<br />\nSenator Mathias felt that a significant free speech<br />\nissue was raised by the hecklers. He noted that \"arbitrary individuals\" as well as \"arbitrary government\"<br />\ncan interrupt the \"rational exchange of ideas.\"<br />\nOn the other hand, many persons present felt that<br />\nno serious abridgement of free speech took place. A<br />\nWCBM newsman stated that the protest activities were<br />\n\"within the realm of dialogue.\" Several students observed<br />\nthat Senator Stennis wak always able to continue his<br />\nspeech. A faculty member pointed out that \"Senator<br />\nStennis doesn't really need our podium to communicate his opinions.\"<br /><br />\nSoviet Exploits<br />\nSince \"the Soviets can be expected to exploit the<br />\nthe talks for propaganda and other pruposes,\" observed<br />\nStennis, \"we must ascertain the balance of power before<br />\nmaking any agreement.

Many individuals<br />\non this campus find ROTC program among<br />\nHopkins students is declining, and the<br />\npresence of ROTC directly hinders the<br />\ntraining of scholars, a primary function<br />\nof the University. This letter may not do<br />\njustice to the subject, but it does outline<br />\nbriefly what I believe to be important<br />\npoints for serious consideration.<br />\nI do not feel that the University should<br />\nhave a contractural obligationto produce<br />\n\"a minimum of twenty five officers per<br />\nyear\" from \"a Department of Military<br />\nScience as an integral academic and administrative department of the institution<br />\nand to adopt as part of its curriculum...<br />\nmilitary instruction...which the Secretary of the Army will prescribe and<br />\nconduct.\" (Quoted from<br />\nAgreement<br />\nRegarding Facilities to be Provided for<br />\nthe Use of the Army Reserve Officers'<br />\nTraining Corps Program, Without Expense to the Department of the Army,<br />\nsigned March 11, 1965). That ROTC<br /><br />\ncourses are no longer given academic<br />\ncredit is irrelevant. Admittedly, this<br />\ncontract does not interfere with my<br />\n\"rights and freedoms\" (Dr. Gordon on<br />\nMay 16, 1969), but it does make me question the purpose of life spent at an institution<br />\nholding<br />\nsuch contractural<br />\nobligations and the viewpoint that underlies maintenance of such contract in<br />\nthe modern world.<br />\nThe accompanying Table was compiled<br />\nfrom the annual Report of the Faculties<br />\nand Administration. The data shows that<br />\nstudent participation in ROTC in the<br />\n1930's and again in the 1950's ranged<br />\nfrom 28-52 per year. In spite of a<br />\nsignificantly higher student population<br />\nand pressures of the Vietnam war, participation and commissions in recent<br />\nyears run only about half of the earlier<br />\nperiods. Not only has interest in ROTC<br />\nwaned, but throughout its publicly recorded history ROTC has been tremondously wasteful of student effort.<br />\nBoth lack of interest and wastefulness<br />\nof time are exemplified by the following<br />\nexample, rather typical for the 1960's.<br />\nIn 1964, of 109 students enrolled in MSI<br />\nonly 54 finished, only 25 completed MSII<br />\nthe following year, only 17 completed<br />\nMSIII, only 16 completed MSIV, and 15<br /><br />\ncommissions resulted. This is a 14%<br />\nyield. As Vietnam tapers off, interest<br />\nis bound to decline even more. The University owns the ROTC buildings; these<br />\nfacilities, for which the University already provides janitorial and maintenance services, could be utilized to greater advantage were the buildings converted to use ,for a wide variety of student<br />\nactivities.<br />\nSince 1967 the \"Total enrolled\" (see<br />\nTable) increasing numbers of students<br />\nfrom Towson State, Baltimore Junior<br />\nCollege, and U. Maryland Law School.<br />\nparticipation of these \"Good<br />\nThe<br />\nNeighbors\" in a Hopkins activity must be<br />\nweighed in terms of, for example, the<br />\nparticipation of \"Not-So-Good-Neighbors\" in anti-Rotc demonstrations.<br />\nWhy is Hopkins \"Good Neighbor Policy\"<br />\npublicized with regard to ROTC<br />\nbut<br />\nvieled with regard to other exchanges,<br />\nsuch interactions with Morgan<br />\nState<br />\nCollege?<br />\nFinally, we may examine in the Table<br />\nthe vastly increased monetary input into<br />\nthe student wallet, estimated as increasing from $17,000 to well over $80,000<br />\nin the last three years. From 1956 through about 1964 ROTC participants<br />\nearned 90C per day; in 1965 this was<br /><br />\nchanged to $40/month. In 1966<br />\ntwo<br />\n4-year and three 2-year scholarships<br />\nwith all tuition, -books, and fees, plus<br />\n$50/month, were assigned to Hopkins.<br />\nOther students have elected to bring<br />\nArmy scholarships to Hopkins so that<br />\nby 1968 there were 22 students on full<br />\nROTC money. It is not clear if these<br />\nstudents are selectively admitted. In<br />\nany event, aboliton of ROTC at Hopkins (unfortunately!) would still leave<br />\na wide range of universities that students could take their Army scholarships to. It in no way would endanger<br />\nHopkins financial structure. Enrollment of these students elsewhere would<br />\nbe to Hopkins great benefit. Following<br />\ngraduation they are committed to<br />\n6<br />\nyears in the Army including two to four<br />\nyears of active duty. It seems unlikely<br />\nthat, once Vietnam subsides, these men<br />\ncan compete with students uncommitted to active military service and become tomorrow's scholars.<br />\nPhilip E.

The program has been surviving on a $1,000 loan from the university's<br />\ncontingency fund. Because this money will<br />\nnot last substantially longer, Dr. Wickwire has been exploring every possible<br />\nsourse of additional funds.<br /><br />\nBusses Still Needed<br />\nThe problems of funding the Saturday<br />\nmorning program may be solved soon, he<br />\nnoted. The Community Action Agencies,<br />\nwhich have worked with Hopkins in organizing the Saturday morning program,<br />\nalways have access to money. George<br />\nKoutouzos of the Levering Hall staff stated that two of the six C.A.A.'s have already started providing busses to bring<br />\nthe tutees to the Hopkins campus. Dr.<br />\nWickwire feels confident that the other<br />\nfour C.A.A.'s will start doing so soon.<br />\nBusses are the major expense of the<br />\ntutoring program. Wickwire stated he is<br />\nworking hard to get agency support and<br />\nmoney.<br />\nThe problems . of the Tuesday and<br /><br />\nSPECIAL<br />\nNOTICE<br />\nStudent<br />\nand<br />\nFaculty<br />\nDiscounts<br /><br />\nThursday evening program, which are<br />\nrun in connection with the public schools,<br />\nare further from solution. Dr. Wickwire<br />\nmentioned Dr. William Bevan has been<br />\nmentioned Dr. William Bevan vice-president of Hopkins and top administrator<br />\nfor Levering, has been of great help in<br />\nLevering's search for funds. He and Dr.<br />\nWickwire are planning to see Dr. Sheldon, the superintendent of Baltimore public schools, since there is still the possibility of financial aid from his office.<br />\nMr. Blaisdell, Bevan's assistant, is finding out which federal agencies may be<br />\nable to provide money for the program.<br />\nHEW, HUD and 0E0 grants are possibilities according to V/ickwire.<br />\nThe University Chaplain also said<br />\nthat he and Dr. Bevan would be working<br />\nwith representatives of the Johns Hopkins Fund, whose function is to find private funds and individuals that may be<br />\nwilling to donate money for activities on<br />\nthe campuses of the university. Levering is exploring the possibilities of a<br />\nbenefit performance in Shriver Hall by<br />\nsome well-known artist or group. Other<br />\nideas may be developed tomorrow at a<br />\nmeeting of high school volunteers in the<br />\ntutoring program. Dr. Wickwire felt certain that one or another of these ideas<br />\nwill prove fruitful, and expected results<br />\nwithin two weeks.<br /><br />\ning program a richer one than it has been<br />\nin previous years. They are giving the<br />\nparents of the tutors the chance to tell<br />\nthem what they think ought to be done in<br />\nthe program, and what aspects of tutoring are most important to them.<br /><br />\nTeacher's Opinions<br />\nAlso, an attempt is being made to relate the tutors to the public schoolteachers of the tutees. In past years teachers have provided only minimal information about each tutee, their reading and<br />\nmath levels, and the teacher's opinions<br />\nof the children's particular needs. The<br />\ntutors are being encouraged to get in<br />\ntouch with the teachers, in order to discuss their individual tutees work at<br />\nschool. Those tutors who have already<br />\ndone this describe the teachers as being<br />\ngenerally quite cooperative. Further enrichment of the program may result from<br />\nLevering's policy of trying to maintain<br />\nyear-by-year contact with the same<br />\nchildren.<br />\nDan Smith of the Student Association<br />\nexpressed enthusiasm about the program,<br />\nparticularly the Tuesday and Thursday<br />\nsection. He estimated that the number<br />\nof tutor-tutee pairs in this program to<br />\nbe about seventy, with about thirty of the<br />\ntutors enrolled in the tutoring course.<br />\nHe said that this program was running<br />\n\"extraordinarily well.\"<br /><br />\nWickwire said that he and his staff<br />\nwere trying to make this year's tutor-<br /><br />\nWe need your head in our<br />\nbusiness<br /><br />\nJEN'S<br /><br />\nPaul Barber Shop<br />\n3120 St. Paul St.<br />\nAcross from Eddie'c<br /><br />\n.<br /><br />\nBrakes<br />\nAlignment<br />\nTune-Up<br />\nGrease &amp; Oil Change<br />\nShock Absorbers<br />\nMufflers<br />\nAnti-Freeze<br />\nWheels<br /><br />\nPaul<br />\nSchnitzer<br />\nTire Co.<br />\n1027-39<br />\nHillen St.<br />\n539 5390<br /><br />\nSUBMARINES<br />\nDOUBLEBURGERS<br />\nEAT-IN OR CARRY-OUT<br />\nST.

In effect<br />\nwhat the administration has done is to<br />\nset up boundaries within which the entire Hopkins community can act. The<br />\nimplication is clear. Step out of line and<br />\nthe axe will fall.<br />\nBut really dear Hoppies, could there<br />\nhave been any other decision than that<br />\nissued on October 17?

Really, who<br />\ndo Bilgrave, Kimball, et al. think they<br />\nare kidding? Either the administration<br />\nis trule scared of its \"effete corps of<br />\nimpudent snobs\" or thinks it can quiet<br />\ndissent by channelling it rhough a quasijudicial procedure. The whitewash of<br />\nan appeals court with its faculty and administration representatives has been<br />\nused to hide the glaring fact that the<br />\nadministration still has its head stuck<br />\nin the sand when it comes to allowingthe<br />\nstudent to act as a free agent on Homewood Campus, or at least with a minimum<br />\nof red tape.

Treem, Class of 1969<br /><br />\nBIGOTS VS. PIGOTS<br />\nTo the Editors:<br />\nThe SDS would have us believe that<br />\nOne who discriminates because of race,<br />\ncreed, or color, is a bigot and a pig. I<br />\nagree. Because of his Southern heritage, senator John C. Stennis was associated with the KKK and Confederate flag<br />\nby two SDS big guns dressed in posh<br />\nHalloween garb. Surely there is enough<br />\nin the Senator's voting record to justify<br />\na point by point attack of his policies by<br />\nmost liberals. When then must some<br />\ncontinue to harass individuals because of<br />\ntheir geographical location? Does not<br /><br />\nthe Senator deserve the same rights<br />\naccorded by white liberals to blacks;<br />\nthat is to be judged solely by his performance?<br />\nThese local SDS leaders<br />\nwould have use believe they are not bigots<br />\nand pigots (sic). I disagree.<br />\nDavid Thorndill<br /><br />\nAH,SWEET DEMOCRACY<br />\nTo the Editors:<br />\nI would like to make a few comments<br />\non Steve Blumenthal's analysis of Dr.<br />\nGeorge Wald's military-industrial complex lecture. For all his criticisms,<br />\nBlumenthal ends up in the same boat as<br />\nWald: neither of them has a vision of a<br />\npossible solution to the economically<br />\nwasteful spending which characterizes<br />\nour economic system.<br />\nBut Blumenthal's analysis of the problem is right: It will be mighty difficult,<br />\nif not impossible, for this capitalistic<br />\nsystem to cope with disarmament, without creating serious problems of unemployment and/or inflation. Which analysis, in itself, is a rather devastating<br />\ncritique of capitalism, if Blumenthal<br />\nwould only admit it.<br />\nBut to complete the analysis, we<br />\nshouldn't stop at military spending. What<br />\nabout the huge expenditures big business<br />\nmakes in advertising, which are costs<br />\nborne by the consumer, but which add<br />\nnothing to the quality of the commodity?<br />\nWhat about the waste of housing, and<br />\nmalnutrition, conditions which could be<br />\neliminated if we dated to eliminate the<br />\nexploitative profits which are perpetuated by this waste?<br />\nWhat about the<br />\nwaste of human labor which results from<br />\nplanned commodity obsolescence, planned to keep sales and profits up?<br />\nWell, it's probably impossible to eliminate any of these wastes within the<br />\ncapitalist framework, because the crux<br />\nof the problem is that socially useful<br />\nactivity is not always profitable activity<br />\nin the eyes of the pig-headed businessmen who run the economy, the government, and our lives.<br />\nSo I submit: If we are to change the<br />\npresent state of affairs, we must runthe<br /><br />\nBEDLAM BOUTIQUE<br /><br />\neconomy for everybody , and ,ot just for<br />\nthe lazy rich people who live off unearned<br />\nprofits. This is a difficult solution to<br />\nachieve, for it requires political, and<br />\nprobably armed, struggle. Furthermore,<br />\na satisfactory solution will only be<br />\nachieved after a long process of trial<br />\nand error. Look at China and Cuba, in<br />\ntheir continuing struggle to create a just<br />\neconomic and social order. It's an uphill<br />\nfight, but the alternative is downhill,<br />\nstagnating, capitalism, which needs huge<br />\ndoses of wasteful government spending,<br />\nconsumer credit, and foreign markets to<br />\nkeep it moving.<br />\nJust one more point. In the last paragraph of his article, Blumenthal confuses<br />\nliberals with the new left. Well, many<br />\n\"new leftists\", unlike the liberals, don't<br />\nenvision the existing order as capable of<br />\nsolving its own contradictions, so we're<br />\nout to create a new socialist order.<br />\nBlumenthal and the radical right would<br />\ndo well to recognize the differences between the new left and \"corporate\" liberalism (which is what all liberalism is<br />\ntoday), because if they don't, they'll end<br />\nup with a George Wallace who'll serve<br />\nthe people the same shit, but more of it.<br />\nPOWER TO THE PEOPLE<br />\nihifiter<br /><br />\ncook and bottle washer tomorrow.<br />\nI wonder if all this pursuit for equality<br />\nof the sexes will mean that IBM's president of the 80's will be someone named<br />\nTillie Mirabelle.<br />\nB. L.<br /><br />\n\"NO INFRINGEMENT\"<br />\nTo The Editors:<br />\nAs a member of the Student Affairs<br />\nCommittee who was unable to participate in the appeal stemming from the<br />\nevents of Oct. 15, I would like to respond<br />\nto last week's letter from Mr. Gleser. I<br />\nagree that it would be a \"dangerous<br />\nprecedent\" for judicial bodies \"to make<br />\nmotivation itself a legal acquittal for<br />\nmisconduct.\" However, it is my understanding that the appeal was not upheld<br />\non the grounds of the motivation of the<br />\nappellants.<br />\nRather, it was upheld because \"no<br />\nsubstantial infringement of the rights of<br />\nothers occurred as a result of\" the<br />\nband's playing at the teach-in: the disturbance the band created was minimal<br />\nin comparison with that caused by the<br />\nother, administration-approved, teachin activities.<br />\nIt is true that, in Mr.<br />\nGleser's words, the \"appellant students<br />\ndeliberately disobeyed a direct order<br />\nfrom 'an' administrative officer.\" But<br />\nthe Committee's decision in upholding<br />\nthe appeal seems to imply that disobedience of administrative orders does not<br />\nconstitute prima facie evidence of the<br />\ninfringement of rights of others.The use<br />\nof the latter principle independently of<br />\nthe identity of the complainant seems to<br />\nme the best assurance of the impartial<br />\njustice whose maintenance is rightly of<br />\nconcern to Mr. Gleser.<br />\nFinally, in the light of the discussion<br />\nof the draft conduct statement currently<br />\ngoing on in the Student Affairs Committee, it seems likely that the clause<br />\nwhich troubles Mr. Gleser will be modified. Hence I suspect that the Committee<br />\nis in agreement with Mr. Gleser on this<br />\npoint, although this view and others in<br />\nthis letter are my own, and do not constitute the Committee's official position.<br />\nRich Con riser, Social Relations<br /><br />\nTHE HOPKINS WOMAN<br />\nTo The Editors:<br />\nIn view of the recent decision to admit<br />\nwomen to undergraduate programs at<br />\nJohns Hopkins University, I feel compelled to bring forth an age old argument in opposition.<br />\nThe competition for graduates of the<br />\nprestigeous schools in industry has<br />\nnever been more keen.

About tomorrow's tilt with<br />\nSwarthmore, Sotir asserts, \"No game can be considered a breather<br />\nwhen you have 74 points scored on you in two games and your offense<br />\ndoesn't even score once.\"<br />\nAdmittedly, the statistic sheets have looked more and more dismal<br />\nafter the Hampden-Sydney and Carnegie-Mellonfiascoes. Individuals<br />\ncould be cited, but that would prove little since those who made mis\u2022<br />\ntakes already know it.<br />\nThe most glaring and obvious statistic is the team's recent failure<br />\nto score more than their opponents. Over six games, the offense has<br />\naccounted for 109 points; the defense has let in 143 points.<br />\nExcuses could be offered such as the injuries to Dave Pickall,<br />\nChuck Pinsky, and other key personnel, but this shirks the real issue.<br />\nWhat is at stake is a team's pride. If they really are hungry, they<br />\nwill start to redeem themselves by first crushingSwarthmore tomorrow, then upsetting Dickinson, and finishing up by blowing Western<br />\nright out of Homewood Field on November 22. But that<br />\nMaryland<br />\nmeans they've got to really want to do it.<br />\nThat means getting up for each game and cutting down on the number<br />\nof turnovers (fumbles and interceptions).<br /><br />\nBy ED BRETHAUER<br />\nLast Saturday, the Hopkins Bluejays spoiled<br />\nthe Loyola Greyhounds' 32 game streak without a<br />\nloss by downing them, 1-0. The game was marked by some great offensive play on the part of<br />\nAlbee Samper and Bob Szeles, and excellent defensive play by every member of the team.<br />\nThe first quarter showed what kind of game<br />\nHopkins was to play the rest of the afternoon.<br />\nActual shots on goal by Hopkins were a small<br />\nnumber compared to those by Loyola, but the<br />\nHopkins defense, led by Steve Weiss, held tough.<br />\nIn the first quarter, Weiss had to face two direct<br />\nkicks, several line drive shots right at him, and a<br />\ncouple shots bouncing directly in front of the goal.<br />\nYet, with the help of Randy Miller, Keith Ross, Pat<br />\nBarry, and the defense, Weiss was able to hold<br />\nLoyola to no score.<br />\nThe second quarter seemed to model the first<br />\nalmost exactly, with a little more offensive provided by Linemen Pat Barry and Albee Sampler.<br />\nLoyola continued, though, to dominate the offensive play, either by stealing the ball or by penalties to Hopkins. Weiss was again forced to make<br />\nseveral saves on corner kicks and direct shots,<br />\nthough some of Loyola's shots were nullified by<br />\npenalties. Rick tobey and John Clisham also blocked several good shots, though the key play of the<br />\nquarter was Weiss' diving save of a ball which had<br />\nbounced off the goalpost. The score at the end of<br />\nthe half was still 0-0.<br /><br />\nWho's to Blame?<br />\nPerhaps the fault does not lay entirely with the team. Sotir, two<br />\nYears ago, began to build awinning tradition in football which involves<br />\nthe fans as well as the football players. He gave Hopkins something<br />\nto cheer about besides lacrosse. Yet this year the team has played<br />\nbefore diminishing crowds at every home game. More than losing,<br />\nwe feel the ridiculous policy of charging admission to blame.<br />\nSotir has never lost faith in his team's ability to play good football.<br />\nIn fact he is confident that they will before the season is over. It is<br />\ntime the team started believing in themselves and got the job done.<br />\nAt long last a permanent Athletic Committee has been formed to<br />\ncope with the mounting problems of the Physical Education Department. However, the Athletic Committee's effectiveness has been<br />\nlimited by its deep entanglement in the university's often inefficient<br />\nbureaucracy.<br />\nThe committee has been added as a' sub-committee of Dr. John<br />\nWhite's Committee on Student Affairs - a sort of added lower rung<br />\non Dr. Gordon's bureacratic ladder. Theoretically, a recommendation would have to go through White's committee, next the Academic<br />\nCouncil, then Homewood House, and finally ending with the Board of<br />\nTrustees.<br />\nBy misplacing the Athletic Committee (more people than students<br />\nare involved and affected) as a sub-committee of the Committee on<br />\nStudent Affairs, the administation is unnecessarily complicating the<br />\ncommittee system which Dr. Gordon do strongly advocates. A more<br />\nautonomous Athletic Committee is what we had in mind when we recommended the creation of such a committee.<br /><br />\nOffense Psyched<br />\nHopkins came into the third quarter a little<br />\nmore psyched up on offense, and responded with<br />\na beautiful goal on a cross from Bob Szeles to<br />\nAlbee Samper, who headed it directly into the net.<br />\nAfter this goal, the whole team seemed sparked,<br />\ndespite the referees' rather technical calls. The<br />\ndefense constantly stopped Loyola's progress<br />\ndownfield, and sent the ball up toSamper and the<br />\nother linemen, who came close to actually scoring at least two more time during the quarter.<br />\nBut the defense again deserves.the most credit,<br />\nled especially by Randy Miller, Rick Tobey, and<br />\nSteve Weiss during this quarter. Though the actual shots on the goalie were decreased, Weiss made<br />\nseveral spectacular saves, especially one on a<br />\nloose ball rolling right in ront of the net.<br />\nNear the end of the third quarter and the beginning of the fourth, the refs made several controversial calls which really did not hurt Hopkins<br />\nthat much. Every player on the field and every<br />\nsubstitute was determined at that point not to let<br />\nLoyola score, and their play showed it.<br /><br />\nSteve Weiss leaps high in air for a save. Weiss has<br />\n4 shut-outs so far this year. Only 5 goals have been<br />\nscored on him in 7 games.<br />\nphoto by hatlis<br />\nIn the last quarter, despite some great shooting by Szeles and Samper, Loyola's offence once<br />\nagain put the pressure on our defense. Great<br />\nplays were made by Danny Hall, Pat Barry, Randy<br />\nMiller, who was everywhere, and,of course,Steve<br />\nWeiss. Weiss caught several line shots by Denny<br />\nWit and Ty Smith, and made a spectacular jumping save on a ballwhich almost went over his head<br />\nin front of the goal. But it was appropriate that,<br />\non the last play of the game,Weiss again protected the lead following a very high kickinghe<br />\n.air<br />\ndirectly in front of the goal.<br /><br />\n\"Beat The Best\"<br />\nDuring the three games before last weekend,<br />\nHopkins had shown signs of floundering, due to<br />\nthe great number of injuries which the team had<br />\nsuffered. Nevertheless, the victory against Loyola<br />\nseemed to show how well the substitutes have fit<br />\nin with the play of the team, and how determined<br />\nthe team is to win. As Coach Knauff said, \"I<br />\ncouldn't have been more pleased with the performance of the whole team, especially the defense.<br />\nWe feel we beat the best when we beat Loyola.\"<br /><br />\nBIA NOTES<br /><br />\nCope Chairs Committee<br />\nThe committee is chaired by Dr. Jackson Cope who was a member<br />\nof last year's ad hoc committee on physical education. Other members<br />\ninclude senior Paul Allen, who is the committee's secretary, and<br />\nfellow senior, Weedy Hammond, who is also presently President of<br />\nthe Booster Club. Richard Barch, is the graduate student representative. Also on the committee are Marshall Turner, Director of<br />\nAthletics and head football coach Alex Sotir.<br />\nSome of the issues facing the committee are a review of the admissions policy to athletic events, and financial sanction of post<br />\nseason play. Also to be considered is the freshman petition to drop<br />\nphysed. Another concern is repair and maintenance of the Athletic<br />\nCenter which, supposedly, is the responsibility of the Plant Manager's<br />\nOffice. Earlier in the year atrocious conditions of the squash courts<br />\nand the showers brought irate letters from faculty members.<br />\nWe welcome the creation of the committee but regret that it doe\u2018<br />\nnot have a more direct line to Dr. Gordon's ear. We encourage the<br />\ncommittee to take an active part in solving the Athletic Department's<br />\nproblems. Also, we warn against the committee becoming too complacent.<br />\nAt the two-hour first meeting on October 30 of the committee, it<br />\nwas suggested that the committee meet once a month. This we feel is<br />\ntoo infrequent if the committee is to be an effective group. Creation<br />\nof the committee was long overdue. Now that is here it must recognize the issues and accept the responsibilityof meeting as frequently<br />\nas necessary to solve them.<br /><br />\nSouthern leader KA,a week ago yesterday, handed Sig Ep a 6-0 loss as Glen Deuchler returned to<br />\nthe KA line-up.

Three clipping penalties on kickoffs in addition to 47<br />\nyards worth of other penalties put the<br />\nJays in passing situations a lot of the<br />\ngame.<br /><br />\nThe first Carnegie-Mellow touchdown<br />\nwas set up after Charley Coker fumbled<br />\na punt and the Tartans recovered on the<br />\nBlue Jay twenty yard line. Four plays<br />\nlater, the Tartans' Freshman fullback,<br />\nTerry Bell, ran into the end zone from<br />\nnine yards out.<br />\nAfter this initial Blue Jay mistake,<br />\nBobby Pfieffer and later Dan Augustine<br />\nquarterbacked Hopkins using the passing<br />\nattack extensively against the strong pass<br />\nsecondary of Carnegie-Mellon. What resulted was only twelve completed passes<br />\nin 29 attempts for 103 yards. The Jays'<br />\nquarterbacks were forced to scramble<br />\nmany more times when their receivers<br />\nwere covered.

The Blue<br />\nJays offense never really got moving.<br />\nThey got inside Carnegie's thirty yard<br />\nline only twice and both times lost the<br />\nball on fumbles. Most of the game was<br />\nplayed on Hopkins' half of the field and<br />\nthe Blue Jays spent the afternoon on<br />\nthe defensive.<br />\nThe Tartans hammered away at the<br />\nBlue Jay defenses, and scored two<br />\ntouchdowns in each of the first three quarters.<br />\nThe drive for the Tartans'third touchdown was started after the Blue Jays<br />\npunted and downed the ball on Carnegie's<br />\n47 yard line. In two plays, the ball was<br />\nbrought to Hopkins' 36 yard line. After<br />\nbeing held temporarily for two downs,<br />\nRichie Squires threw a little swing pass<br />\nto Terry Bell, a play that later went 32<br />\nyards for the Tartans' last touchdown<br />\nin the third wuarter. With the ball now on<br />\nthe Hopkins' nineteen, it took three plays<br />\nto finally score. All three of them were<br />\nruns with Tom Lombardo scoring on the<br />\nthird.<br />\nThe Tartans played the second half<br />\ncontaining the Blue Jay passing offense<br />\nand weakened running attack. Steve Utz,<br />\nDan Augustine, and Steve Hata gained<br />\n97 yards for the losers, while the Jays'<br />\nnumber one rusher, Paul Weiss, played<br />\nlinebacker. Meanwhile, the Tartans kept<br />\nthe ball in Hopkins' territory and played<br />\nagainst the clock.<br />\nThe game was the worst for the Blue<br />\nJays since their loss,48-6, against Dickinson in 1965. Dickinson is one the leading contenders in the Middle Atlantic<br />\nConference so far this year, and,although<br />\nthe Blue Jays still have a good shot at<br />\nthe title, they will have to beat Dickinson away on November 15.<br />\nTomorrow, Hopkins plays Swarthmore,<br />\none of the teams occuping the cellar of<br />\nthe MAC.
