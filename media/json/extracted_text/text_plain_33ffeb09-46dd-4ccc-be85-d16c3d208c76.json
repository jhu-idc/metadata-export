Making another<br />\n_journey into the wilds of<br />\nPennsylvania, the Blue Jays did<br />\nbattle (literally) with Noravian<br />\nCollege, coming out on the short<br />\nend of a 61-49 score. Moravian<br />\nwent into the game undefeated in<br />\nleague play and boasted a<br />\npro -sized frontline which<br />\nmeasured 6'11\", 6'7\" and 6'5\".<br />\nThe host size coupled with the<br />\ntough Widener game a few days<br />\nbefore seemed to prove too much<br />\nfor the Homewood quintet.<br />\nThis game also marked the<br />\nstart of a severe shooting slump<br />\nwhich has plagued Hopkins star<br />\nguard Paul Spence. Besides being<br />\nselected for the Schaefer Metro<br />\nAll-Tournament five, Spence (up<br />\nthrough the Widener game) was<br />\nleading the country in field goal<br />\nshooting percentage, hitting a<br />\nspectacular 66% of his shots.<br />\nSince then, however, Spence has<br />\nhad some trouble offensively,<br />\nincluding a 2-for-15 performance<br />\nin Wednesday's loss to Loyola.<br />\n\"It's more mental than<br />\nmechanical,\" Rupert said<br />\nconcerning Spence's slump,\"but<br />\n<br />\nvide better security for the<br />\nAthletic Center. There has been a<br />\nlarge increase in the number of<br />\nlockers that have been vandalized<br />\nand items stolen. Mr. Scott believes that such activities are the<br />\nwork of outsiders who manage to<br />\nget into the building. By limiting<br />\nthe number of outsiders into the<br />\nbuilding, it would be easier to<br />\nmaintain the security of the<br />\nbuilding.<br />\nThe major thrust of the new<br />\npolicy is to amke students more<br />\nresponsible for the guests they<br />\nbring into the gym. When students bring outsiders into the<br />\ngym at the request of the<br />\noutsiders or when students allow<br />\noutsiders to enter the building<br />\nthrough side doors, the students<br />\ndo not remain with these people<br />\nwhile they are inside the building. Since the Athletic Center<br />\ndoes not have the money to put<br />\nguards at each entrance to the<br />\nbuilding, the new guest pass policy will try to regulate the<br />\nnumber of non-Hopkins people<br />\nwho use the building, however it<br />\nrequires the cooperation of all.<br />\nThe new guest pass policy will<br />\nserve toa id in the security of the<br />\nbuilding and protecting the availability of playing space inside.<br />\nThe sponsors of guests must remain with their guests while inside the gym and the guests much<br />\nleave. the building with their<br />\nsponsors.<br />\n<br />\n\f", "format": "basic_html", "processed": "QUOTE OF THE WEEK<br />\n\"There is no way on God's<br />\ngreen earth that a student group<br />\ncan decide whether or not dollar<br />\nappropriations are valid,\" said<br />\nHomewood Vice President<br />\nGeorge Benton.
