In introducing the<br />\nspeaker, Dr. Andrews referred to<br />\nthe important part which Dr.<br />\nRaney had recentiv played in the<br />\nenactment of certa in St a te la ws<br />\nfor the protection of birds.<br />\nDr. Raney began with a brief<br />\nhistory of bird life on this earth.<br />\nOver six million years ago enormous birds with teeth existed.<br />\nFor many centuries, gradual<br />\nchanges came about in these primeval types of birds and they became smaller in size and were no<br />\nlonger equipped with teeth. The<br />\nwell-known loon is a direct survivor Of one of these species of<br />\nover Iwo million years ago. Therefore, in view of the fact that it<br />\nWO<br />\nye f0<br />\nme( li ITS Wit to)<br />\nmillion years, the popular simile,<br />\n-crazy as a loon,\" is decidedly<br />\nlacking in force.<br />\nIn the coining of man, the bil4ls<br />\nfound a fellow-being unprecedentedly cruel and merciful. With the<br />\nadvance of civilization, man's<br />\nI ower to protect or exterminate<br />\nthe bird species became more and<br />\nmore evident ; and, to his shame,<br />\nhe has in many cases preferred to<br />\nexterminate. Since 18-10, 16 different species of birds have become extinct, and at present 19<br />\nother types Are in immediate danger of being destroyed.<br />\nThe lecturer spoke at some<br />\nlength to emphasize the necessity<br />\nfor enacting laws for the protection of the birds of this country.<br />\n\"The hunter who is not influenced by humanitarian arguments against the killing of birds<br />\nis almost certain to take a more<br />\nserious interest in the economic<br />\naspects of this wholesale slaughter,\" he continued. In this connection, he presented instructive<br />\n\u2022 figures concerning the actual<br />\n\u2022 value of supposedly harmful birds.<br />\nOwls and hawks, both of which<br />\nare popularly regarded as distinct<br />\nmenaces to the farmer, . were<br />\nshown io perform a truly valuable service.

Why this burst of \"pep\"<br />\nis evidenced at this time the remainder of the University is at a<br />\nloss to know. Suffice it is to say<br />\nthat the freshmen have seen fit to<br />\nmar the beauty of the campus<br />\nwith gaudy flags and black and<br />\ngreen paint. Why should the rest<br />\nof the college demur? Have not<br />\nthe freshmen proved sufficiently<br />\nto all concerned that they are the<br />\nkings of the campus, by defeating<br />\nthe listless sophomores in every<br />\nactivity this winter?<br />\nLet not the Class of '23 think,<br />\nhowever, because they have succeeded in annuling their regulations ten days before the time at<br />\nwhich they were due to be removed, that this gives them license to flaunt their numerals in<br />\nthe face of all visitors to the University, as well as the rest of the<br />\ncollege.<br />\nThis deplorable practice of enlivening the landscape with the<br />\npaint brush was inaugurated last<br />\nyear by the Class of '22, and bethe upper classes saw fit<br />\nto condone this`deed once it seems<br />\nto have established a precedent to<br />\nwhich each succeeding Freshman<br />\nClass must adhere.<br />\nIf drastic measures are not<br />\ntaken shortly, in the course of<br />\nfive years there will be no scenery<br />\nleft at Hopkins\u2014it will be a mass<br />\nof numerals and scores of longsince forgotten inter-class contests.<br />\nIf we will glance back in our<br />\nmemories to last year and stroll<br />\ndown the walk to the Barn, we<br />\n<br />\nmay recall a large red and white<br />\nbanner flying gracefully from the<br />\ncenter window of the Student Activities Building. This banner is<br />\nbetter known as a service flag, on<br />\nwhich were the figures 760, and<br />\nmany black stars, to which were<br />\nadded from time to time more<br />\nstars, and finally one gold one,<br />\nrepresenting the number of Hopkins men in the service of their<br />\ncountry,<br />\nThis service flag was presented<br />\nto the University by thefOmicron<br />\nDelta Kappa Society in commemoration of the gallant sons of<br />\nJohns Hopkins who were risking<br />\ntheir lives for freedom and democracy. Considerable ceremony accompanied this presentation, and<br />\nHopkins men were proud to point<br />\nto it as they showed their friends<br />\naround the campus.<br />\nNow, we find it hanging in the<br />\nCivil Engineering Lecture Hall,<br />\ngathering dust, and rapidly deteriorating. It is placed over the hole<br />\nfor the motion-picture projector,<br />\nand is pinned aside at any time a<br />\nlecturer wishes to illustrate his<br />\ntalk. Such usage is hardly worthy<br />\na flag to which so much veneration<br />\nshould be attached.<br />\nWe suggest that it be put in<br />\nsome place where it can best withstand the ravages of time, attended by suitable ceremony on the<br />\npart of the University.

The first is the Adams<br />\ncontest ihi public speaking for the<br />\ngold medal given annually in commemoration of I'rof. Herbert B.<br />\nAdams. This contest is limited<br />\nto members of the Sophomore<br />\nClass. The contestants, chosen in<br />\na preliminary contest some weeks<br />\nago, are P. C. Williams, D. H.<br />\nMacDonald, C. C. Marbury and<br />\nA. E. Dimond, who will speak in<br />\nthe order .named, using selections<br />\nfrom contemporary speeches. The<br />\njudges will probably consist of<br />\nthree alumni, who were themselves participants in the Adams<br />\ncontests of a decade or more ago.<br />\nAfter the public speaking, will<br />\ncome the Tocqueville contest in<br />\noral discussion. The prize, which<br />\nmay be competed for by any undergraduate, is the gold. medal<br />\ngiven annually to Johns Hopkins<br />\nby the Baron Pierre de Coubertin, a distinguished French historian. The medal is transmitted<br />\nto us through the French Government and our own State Department. To win it is to achieve one<br />\nof the highest distinctions that<br />\ncan come to a student in the<br />\ncourse of his undergraduate studies. Those who will strive for it<br />\non Friday night are: Mitchell B.<br />\nCarroll, '21; Oscar W. McCleary,<br />\n'20; John R. Bartels, '20; and<br />\nJohn H. Lewin, '20. They will<br />\ndiscuss various aspects of the general topic, \"The Presidency in the<br />\nFrench Republic.\" Incidental music will be furnished by students.<br />\nThe public is invited to attend.<br />\n<br />\nA plan, which should be of interest to.many students, istheing<br />\nformulated by Mr. Giovanni,Schiavo, for a summer'trip to Italy<br />\nin 1921.<br />\nTo carry out the idea, which is<br />\nindeed an excellent one, the number of men who would wish to<br />\nmake the trip must be known<br />\nat once. Mr. Schiavo's first<br />\nmove will be to get in touch<br />\nwith the Italian Government and<br />\nmake arrangements by which reduced passenger rates can be secured. Provision for accommodations on tine,other side will also<br />\nhave to be arranged for by the<br />\nItalian Tourists' Society.<br />\nThe trip, which will be of added<br />\ninterest to engineers, will be made<br />\nwith a purpose of studying Italian engineering problems and<br />\ngeneral conditions in Italy. Some<br />\ntime will be devoted, however, to<br />\nan inspection of sonic of the<br />\nfamous art collections anal sightseeing inn general.<br />\nMr. Schiavo has sounded the<br />\nengineering faculty and has found<br />\nthat Dr. Whitehead will give<br />\nthree months'credit for industrial<br />\nwork to those students who make<br />\nthe trip.<br />\nThe real aim of the expedition<br />\nwill be to show Italy', contribution to modern tiviliza t ion anti to<br />\nbring American students in closer<br />\ntouch with Italian methods. Before the war, this same plan was<br />\nput into effect by German students with a result that many<br />\nlate improvements were equally<br />\nshared by the two nations.<br />\nThis is indeed a rare opportunity for a summer trip abroad at a<br />\nlow expense. The value of the<br />\nexperiences and the broadening<br />\nof the student's mind will be sufficient to repay the time spent,<br />\nnot taking into account the practical engineering knowledge that<br />\nhe will gather.<br />\nThe enthusiasm of Mr. Schiavo<br />\nin his plan is such that he will<br />\nmake an appeal to other colleges,<br />\nin an effort to muster as* many<br />\nmen to make the trip as is possible. The larger the number who<br />\nare able to go, the greater financial assistance will be received,<br />\nmaking the expenses correspondingly smaller.<br />\nThe immediate.communication<br />\nwith Mr. Schiavo of those who are<br />\ninterested will be greatly appreciated, and will enable him to<br />\ntake definite action in putting the<br />\n'natter before officials of the Ital-<br />\n<br />\nHonor System Voted Down.<br />\n<br />\nAt a recent vote taken at Dartmouth, the adoption of the honor<br />\nsystem was overwhelmingly defeated, the actual vote being 578<br />\nagainst and 436 for its adoption.<br />\nAs a result of this vote, agitation<br />\nfor the honor system will probably be dropped and the present<br />\nproctoring system during examinations continued. The ballots<br />\ncast showed that many were in<br />\nfavor of an honor system, but'did<br />\nnot favor the clause which provides that a violator of the system should be reported by an observer of the breach.<br />\n<br />\nWomen Medical Students.<br />\n<br />\nciroy Cjailored<br />\n<br />\nSOFT COLLARS<br />\n<br />\nProfessors in the Medical<br />\nSchool of the University of Pennsylvania have joined with the students in demanding the exclusion<br />\nof women front the classes in the<br />\nfuture.

Why this burst of \"pep\"<br />\nis evidenced at this time the remainder of the University is at a<br />\nloss to know. Suffice it is to say<br />\nthat the freshmen have seen fit to<br />\nmar the beauty of the campus<br />\nwith gaudy flags and black and<br />\ngreen paint. Why should the rest<br />\nof the college demur? Have not<br />\nthe freshmen proved sufficiently<br />\nto all concerned that they are the<br />\nkings of the campus, by defeating<br />\nthe listless sophomores in every<br />\nactivity this winter?<br />\nLet not the Class of '23 think,<br />\nhowever, because they have succeeded in annuling their regulations ten days before the time at<br />\nwhich they were due to be removed, that this gives them license to flaunt their numerals in<br />\nthe face of all visitors to the University, as well as the rest of the<br />\ncollege.<br />\nThis deplorable practice of enlivening the landscape with the<br />\npaint brush was inaugurated last<br />\nyear by the Class of '22, and bethe upper classes saw fit<br />\nto condone this`deed once it seems<br />\nto have established a precedent to<br />\nwhich each succeeding Freshman<br />\nClass must adhere.<br />\nIf drastic measures are not<br />\ntaken shortly, in the course of<br />\nfive years there will be no scenery<br />\nleft at Hopkins\u2014it will be a mass<br />\nof numerals and scores of longsince forgotten inter-class contests.<br />\nIf we will glance back in our<br />\nmemories to last year and stroll<br />\ndown the walk to the Barn, we<br /><br />\nmay recall a large red and white<br />\nbanner flying gracefully from the<br />\ncenter window of the Student Activities Building. This banner is<br />\nbetter known as a service flag, on<br />\nwhich were the figures 760, and<br />\nmany black stars, to which were<br />\nadded from time to time more<br />\nstars, and finally one gold one,<br />\nrepresenting the number of Hopkins men in the service of their<br />\ncountry,<br />\nThis service flag was presented<br />\nto the University by thefOmicron<br />\nDelta Kappa Society in commemoration of the gallant sons of<br />\nJohns Hopkins who were risking<br />\ntheir lives for freedom and democracy. Considerable ceremony accompanied this presentation, and<br />\nHopkins men were proud to point<br />\nto it as they showed their friends<br />\naround the campus.<br />\nNow, we find it hanging in the<br />\nCivil Engineering Lecture Hall,<br />\ngathering dust, and rapidly deteriorating. It is placed over the hole<br />\nfor the motion-picture projector,<br />\nand is pinned aside at any time a<br />\nlecturer wishes to illustrate his<br />\ntalk. Such usage is hardly worthy<br />\na flag to which so much veneration<br />\nshould be attached.<br />\nWe suggest that it be put in<br />\nsome place where it can best withstand the ravages of time, attended by suitable ceremony on the<br />\npart of the University.

Mr. Schiavo's first<br />\nmove will be to get in touch<br />\nwith the Italian Government and<br />\nmake arrangements by which reduced passenger rates can be secured. Provision for accommodations on tine,other side will also<br />\nhave to be arranged for by the<br />\nItalian Tourists' Society.<br />\nThe trip, which will be of added<br />\ninterest to engineers, will be made<br />\nwith a purpose of studying Italian engineering problems and<br />\ngeneral conditions in Italy. Some<br />\ntime will be devoted, however, to<br />\nan inspection of sonic of the<br />\nfamous art collections anal sightseeing inn general.<br />\nMr. Schiavo has sounded the<br />\nengineering faculty and has found<br />\nthat Dr. Whitehead will give<br />\nthree months'credit for industrial<br />\nwork to those students who make<br />\nthe trip.<br />\nThe real aim of the expedition<br />\nwill be to show Italy', contribution to modern tiviliza t ion anti to<br />\nbring American students in closer<br />\ntouch with Italian methods. Before the war, this same plan was<br />\nput into effect by German students with a result that many<br />\nlate improvements were equally<br />\nshared by the two nations.<br />\nThis is indeed a rare opportunity for a summer trip abroad at a<br />\nlow expense. The value of the<br />\nexperiences and the broadening<br />\nof the student's mind will be sufficient to repay the time spent,<br />\nnot taking into account the practical engineering knowledge that<br />\nhe will gather.<br />\nThe enthusiasm of Mr. Schiavo<br />\nin his plan is such that he will<br />\nmake an appeal to other colleges,<br />\nin an effort to muster as* many<br />\nmen to make the trip as is possible. The larger the number who<br />\nare able to go, the greater financial assistance will be received,<br />\nmaking the expenses correspondingly smaller.<br />\nThe immediate.communication<br />\nwith Mr. Schiavo of those who are<br />\ninterested will be greatly appreciated, and will enable him to<br />\ntake definite action in putting the<br />\n'natter before officials of the Ital-<br /><br />\nHonor System Voted Down.<br /><br />\nAt a recent vote taken at Dartmouth, the adoption of the honor<br />\nsystem was overwhelmingly defeated, the actual vote being 578<br />\nagainst and 436 for its adoption.<br />\nAs a result of this vote, agitation<br />\nfor the honor system will probably be dropped and the present<br />\nproctoring system during examinations continued.
