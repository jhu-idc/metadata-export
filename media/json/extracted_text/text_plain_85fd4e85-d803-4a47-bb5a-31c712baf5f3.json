At a meeting of all prospective wrestling candidates<br />\non Thursday, November 7, Athletic Director Marshall<br />\nTurner stated the following conditions: 1. This year<br />\nHopkins will have no scheduled matches and might get a<br />\nchance to participate in the Mason-Dixon Conference<br />\nTournament. 2. Next year there will be no scheduled<br />\nmatches and Hopkins will probably enter the M-D tourney.<br />\n3. In 1959-'60 there will be scheduled matches if sufficient<br />\ninterest is shown.<br />\nWhen asked to comment on the situation, Senior Bob<br />\nPartridge, a varsity letterman and former member of the<br />\nteam, said, \"It looks as though the future of wrestling at<br />\nHopkins lies in the hands of the freshmen and sophomores<br />\nApparently full scale wrestling will not be present on the<br />\nHopkins sports scene for several years, due to apathy<br />\non the part of the student body here, the difficulties in<br />\nrescheduling teams once they have been dropped, and the<br />\ngeneral hesitancy of the athletic department. With only<br />\nfourteen upperclassmen turning out for the meeting, it<br />\ndoesn't look as though we will be able to field an eightman team in the Mason-Dixon tournament even if we<br />\nshould be lucky enough to be able to participate. However,<br />\nI think that if student interest is such that we can field<br />\nan eight-man varsity and an eight-man freshman team,<br />\nthe athletic director is obligated to try to schedule some<br />\nregular meets next year. It would be placing an almost<br />\nunbearable burden against the future of wrestling at<br />\nHopkins if the greatest offer would only be the possibility<br />\nof entering the Mason-Dixon tournament for the next<br />\ntwo years.\"<br />\nLittle encouragement is being offered those who have<br />\nindicated their desire to wrestle at Hopkins on the intercollegiate level. At best, the seniors might get into the<br />\nMason-Dixon tournament after practicing for a season.<br />\nThe juniors have the added incentive of probable<br />\nparticipation in the M-D tournament after two full seasons<br />\nof practice.<br />\nShould they stick it out for three years, the sophomores will probably be able to compete in dual meets<br />\ntheir senior year.<br />\nThe freshmen will not be able to earn their freshman<br />\nnumerals by wrestling. However, they are fairly assured<br />\nof a chance to earn varsity letters their junior year if<br />\nenough interest is shown by the students in the classes<br />\npreceding and following them.<br />\nTurner said that anyone that goes out for a sport<br />\nto earn a letter is not wanted.

At a meeting of all prospective wrestling candidates<br />\non Thursday, November 7, Athletic Director Marshall<br />\nTurner stated the following conditions: 1. This year<br />\nHopkins will have no scheduled matches and might get a<br />\nchance to participate in the Mason-Dixon Conference<br />\nTournament. 2. Next year there will be no scheduled<br />\nmatches and Hopkins will probably enter the M-D tourney.<br />\n3. In 1959-'60 there will be scheduled matches if sufficient<br />\ninterest is shown.<br />\nWhen asked to comment on the situation, Senior Bob<br />\nPartridge, a varsity letterman and former member of the<br />\nteam, said, \"It looks as though the future of wrestling at<br />\nHopkins lies in the hands of the freshmen and sophomores<br />\nApparently full scale wrestling will not be present on the<br />\nHopkins sports scene for several years, due to apathy<br />\non the part of the student body here, the difficulties in<br />\nrescheduling teams once they have been dropped, and the<br />\ngeneral hesitancy of the athletic department. With only<br />\nfourteen upperclassmen turning out for the meeting, it<br />\ndoesn't look as though we will be able to field an eightman team in the Mason-Dixon tournament even if we<br />\nshould be lucky enough to be able to participate. However,<br />\nI think that if student interest is such that we can field<br />\nan eight-man varsity and an eight-man freshman team,<br />\nthe athletic director is obligated to try to schedule some<br />\nregular meets next year. It would be placing an almost<br />\nunbearable burden against the future of wrestling at<br />\nHopkins if the greatest offer would only be the possibility<br />\nof entering the Mason-Dixon tournament for the next<br />\ntwo years.\"<br />\nLittle encouragement is being offered those who have<br />\nindicated their desire to wrestle at Hopkins on the intercollegiate level. At best, the seniors might get into the<br />\nMason-Dixon tournament after practicing for a season.<br />\nThe juniors have the added incentive of probable<br />\nparticipation in the M-D tournament after two full seasons<br />\nof practice.<br />\nShould they stick it out for three years, the sophomores will probably be able to compete in dual meets<br />\ntheir senior year.<br />\nThe freshmen will not be able to earn their freshman<br />\nnumerals by wrestling. However, they are fairly assured<br />\nof a chance to earn varsity letters their junior year if<br />\nenough interest is shown by the students in the classes<br />\npreceding and following them.<br />\nTurner said that anyone that goes out for a sport<br />\nto earn a letter is not wanted.
