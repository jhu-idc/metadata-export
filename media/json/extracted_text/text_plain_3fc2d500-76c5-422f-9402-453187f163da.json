It is always going to<br />\nbe the middle of someone's career at<br />\nHopkins, and the first round of students<br />\nthat deal with the new system arc inevitably going to have a tou.gher time of it<br />\nthan the classes that graduated before<br />\nthem.<br />\nThe Education Committee's other<br />\nobjection, that the new system will create<br />\nmore anxiety and competition over grades,<br />\nseems irrelevant. Nobody is particularly\"<br />\nmellow about the subject of grades as it is,<br />\nand Hopkins is already pushing us to<br />\nachieve the most we can, so we might as<br />\nwell be rewarded with the most accurate<br />\nindications of our performances.<br />\nThe Committee's opposition to a<br />\nplus-minus grading system for this January<br />\nis a holding action, and a wise one. No one<br />\nwants to have to worry about what their<br />\ngrades mean in the middle of the year. But<br />\nif the new system is put to a referendum,<br />\none of the choices should be plus-minus<br />\ngrading, to be implemented at the beginning of a school year. At an institution this<br />\ntough, no one should kid himself about<br />\nhow he's doing.<br />\n<br />\nHoward Mertz<br />\nLee Wagstaff<br />\nProduction Staff<br />\n<br />\nSuzanne Conklin<br />\nLindsay Kaplan<br />\nP.J.

Their conclusion is<br />\nthat the effects of the new system, particularly upon the chances of graduate school<br />\napplicants, are still too unclear for them to<br />\ntake a stand on the issue, pro or con. They<br />\nwill ask the Student Council for more time<br />\nto consider the new system, and advocate<br />\nputting the matter to referendum.<br />\nThe Committee is thinking with our<br />\nbest interests at heart, and should be<br />\ncommended for its caution. At the very<br />\nleast, bringing in a new grading system in<br />\nthe middle of the year would screw up a lot<br />\nof GPAs, especially in courses where the<br />\nprofessor has not been indicating fine<br />\nshadings of performance, even in his or her<br />\nComments.<br />\nAt its worst, plus-minus<br />\ngrading could be interpreted badly by<br />\ngraduate schools if the nature of the change<br />\nis not made fully clear to them. In fact,<br />\nthe new system will have to be damaging to<br />\nsome: the lower end \"B\" student will<br />\nbe getting a \"B-\", and it's the latter grade<br />\nthat's going to be taken as the more precise<br />\nindication of quality.<br />\nNevertheless, in the long run, the<br />\nEducation Committee's objections to the<br />\nnew system don't add up. Their most valid<br />\narguments, that a) the big difference<br />\nbetween a \"B+\" and a \"B-\" will have a big<br />\neffect on the GPA; b) plus-minus grading<br />\nwill have a serious effect on the \"A-\" and<br />\n<br />\nLetters to the Editor<br />\nScreen Spleen<br />\nTo the Edita:<br />\n<br />\nGranville Greene<br />\n<br />\nIt was with g-eat interest<br />\nthat we read your article on<br />\nCover by<br />\nHopkins' film series.

The article slated<br />\nthat the \"Academic Council<br />\nmembers felt the results did not<br />\nconstitute overwhelming enough<br />\nopposition to justify dropping<br />\nthe plan, especially in light of<br />\nthe lower than expected turnout.\" Since there was absolutely<br />\nno turnout, the decision of the<br />\nAcademic Council may have<br />\nbeen based on faulty information. Also, the above quotation<br />\nmentioned<br />\n\"overwhelming<br />\nenough opposition.\" This implies that the opposition was,<br />\nindeed, overwhelming but not<br />\noverwhelming enough for the<br />\ntaste of the Academic Council. I<br />\nam certain that the Academic<br />\nCouncil would, in light of an<br />\nactual overwhelming vote, take<br />\ninto serious consideration the<br />\nwishes of the student body. By<br />\nthe way, a survey was taken by<br />\nthe Student Council last semester on the subject of plus/minus<br />\ngrading. The students responded<br />\nagainst the system by a margin<br />\nof 3 to 2. I hope that this letter<br />\nhas helped to clear up some of<br />\nthe false and negative impressions which the article gave.<br />\n<br />\nstudy money, and about S500<br />\nmillion worth of cuts in student<br />\nloans.

We are not alone.<br />\nAlso among the fat are the old<br />\nand disabled, for whom the<br />\n<br />\nThe News-Letter apologizes to the directors of the four<br />\nHopkins film series for remarks made in last week's article entitled \"Hopkins Film Series: Who's In Control.\" The article<br />\nwrongfully created the impression that the series' directors, Jeff<br />\nSalmore, Joy Straus, Sue Parkhurst, and Wesley Stites, have<br />\nmanipulated excessive decision-making power into their own<br />\nhands. The article's intention was to point out that student<br />\napathy has resulted in responsibility for the series' being left with<br />\nthose who are willing to shoulder it.<br />\nIn addition, we would like to correct some inaccuracies in<br />\nthe article. The amount of rent that the series pay on each film is<br />\nbased on the highest percentage of their profit margin. Also, it is<br />\nonly the Senior Class Film Series which gets a start-Up budget of<br />\n$200 from the SAC--the other groups are not working on a fixed<br />\nbudget.<br />\nFinally, a more thorough film series questionnaire than<br />\nlast week's is appearing in this week's Arts Section.

The theory is<br />\nbased on the fundamental premise that the current economic<br />\ncrisis results from capitalists<br />\nbeing starved of capital. Without capital, they cannot invest.<br />\nBut there is no such shortage<br />\nof capital. In fact, the banks<br />\nand the large corporations have<br />\nmore capital on their hands<br />\nthan they know what to do with.<br />\nThis is why, in the last few<br />\nyears, the large banks have<br />\nbeen forced to give very risky<br />\nloans to countries such as Brazil,<br />\nTurkey, Poland and Peru. And<br />\nthis is why we are today in the<br />\nmidst of one of the largest<br />\nmerger waves in U.S. history.<br />\nDuPont had no trouble last<br />\nmonth in finding the S7.8 billion<br />\nnecessary to take over Conoco,<br />\nbut this massive investment<br />\nproduced not one job.<br />\nNo. The problem for the<br />\nbig corporations is not to get<br />\ntheir hands on more capital so<br />\nmuch as it is to find profitable<br />\nand productive investments.<br />\nThey can make a higher return<br />\nin the money market or in<br />\nforeign investments than they<br />\ncan investing in steel or cars in<br />\nthe U.S. Thus in 1980, Ford<br />\nclosed part of a large assembly<br />\nplant near Cleveland, costing<br />\n5,000. jobs, while it also announced plans for a new $350<br />\nmillion plant in Mexico. Capital<br />\nis being invested abroad where<br />\nwages are lower.<br />\nTo paraphrase a famous<br />\nsaying, you can supply capital to<br />\na capitalist, but you can't make<br />\nhim invest in jobs. The crisis is<br />\ndue not to a lack of capital<br />\ninvestment but to low profit<br />\nrates throughout much of the<br />\neconomy.<br />\nBefore investment<br />\nwill take place, you have to<br />\nmake it profitable to produce<br />\ncars or steel again in the U.S.<br />\nLittle wonder, then, that<br />\n<br />\nSocial Security budget is being<br />\ncut, and positively obese are<br />\nwelfare recipients, whose benefits are being reduced by 30<br />\npercent.<br />\nWho are the thin people<br />\nwho benefit from the tax cuts?<br />\nWell, businesses are due for a<br />\ndirect tax break of S150 billion,<br />\nand of the remainder going to<br />\nindividuals, the majority will go<br />\nto individuals investing in business. It will come in the form of<br />\ncuts in investment tax, foreign<br />\nearnings taxes, estate taxes,<br />\ncapital gains taxes, gift taxes,<br />\nFor<br />\ntaxes on home sales.<br />\nexample, a two-income family of<br />\nfour will get all of S69 knocked<br />\noff their 1982 taxes if they earn<br />\nS10,000. But if the same family<br />\nearned 10 times as much<br />\n(S100,000), they would get 40<br />\ntimes as much in a tax break<br />\n($2749).<br />\nThis is Reagan's famed and<br />\nfashionable \"supply-side economics.\" In theory it works<br />\nlike this. First you reduce taxes,<br />\nleaving more capital in the hands<br />\nof the capitalists, thereby encouraging them to invest in more<br />\nfactories, the production of<br />\nmore commodities, and eventually the employment of more<br />\nworkers. This greater production would in turn raise the total<br />\ntax revenue despite the lowered<br />\ntax rate. The result? Eternal<br />\nprosperity for all, with tax<br />\ncollectors being the only unemployed.<br />\nBut in practice, the theory<br />\nwill not `work quite so perfectly.<br />\nIn the first place, much of<br />\nReagan's program was already<br />\nimplemented by Thatcher in<br />\nBritain, where it has been an<br />\nunmitigated failure.<br />\nUnemployment is more than 12<br />\npercent, and the conditions for<br />\ncapital investment are so bad,<br />\nthat the Confederation for<br />\nBritish Industry--the large corporate owners and managers--has<br />\nfor the last six months attacked<br />\nThatcher as \"ruinous\"for Britain.<br />\n<br />\ncont. on p. 9<br />\n77eE<br />\ncz, A aEAA.<br />\n.<br />\n/01Cts-'7\"; MOST INTR/641M/G MERE<br />\n81-STS,SoLITARY<br />\nS71.EN-7; 5A,46 COn/VS.<br />\n<br />\n\\<br />\ntc_/<br />\n<br />\notocE 4.mt.LE<br />\n<br />\nKeith Jones<br />\nChairman<br />\nElections Commission<br />\n<br />\nAND NoRfnAL, Like '710.44.<br />\n<br />\n14.,e/q6 ART\"V<br />\n/1-1PLe AND com -l; LiArriZ.<br />\n<br />\n7.iet<br />\n<br />\n--/ReRcueRot<5 A\u20227,-c.a2z5<br />\n.4Deo /4P70<br />\n7-/z\u2018<br />\n<br />\nPunk Lives<br />\n<br />\nY Lite& \u2022 \u2022<br />\n<br />\nTo the Editor:<br />\nI must politely rebut the<br />\nSeptember<br />\n11<br />\nNews-Letter<br />\narticle concerning Baltimore's<br />\nnightclubs.

In this light, supply<br />\nside economics doesn't look<br />\nmuch different from conventional economic theories of supply<br />\nand demand. Reagan is demanding money and concessions from<br />\nthe working class so that he can<br />\nsupply them as capital to the<br />\ncapitalist class. The budget cuts<br />\nwill particularly affect those<br />\nmost dependent on social services\u2014the working class, unemployed, blacks, and women. The<br />\nS36 billion reduction in social<br />\nservices will come out of their<br />\npockets, worsen their education,<br />\nendanger their health; the continued economic decline will<br />\ntake away their jobs.<br />\nReagan has had some successes in creating jobs, though.<br />\nHis greatest was undoubtedly<br />\nwhen he instantaneously created<br />\n12,000 new jobs by firing the air<br />\ntraffic controllers.<br />\nWorking class opposition to<br />\nReagan's sytematic attacks has<br />\nbeen slow.

Classes<br />\nfrom 10-2, work-study job<br />\nfrom 2-5, and then a workt ar<br />\nout at the gym. It's now<br />\n6:30:and walking down St. Paul St. the<br />\nvision of a kitchen sink piled high with<br />\ndirty dishes, cockroaches scurrying over<br />\nthe countertop, and an empty refrigerator<br />\ncomes to mind.

Fortunately, most college.<br />\naged people are healthy enough to<br />\nwithstand the irregular eating habits that<br />\nare a natural component of college<br />\nlife. But cooking for oneself doesn't have<br />\nto be the task that so many sophomores,<br />\njuniors, and seniors seem to find it. It is<br />\npossible to keep a clean kitchen, eat<br />\nregularly, and even maintain a nutritionally balanced diet without expending<br />\nmuch time, energy, or money. Shopping,<br />\ncooking and even cleaning can be relaxing<br />\nways to ease the stresses and strains of<br />\neveryday life.<br />\n<br />\nCOOKING CO-OP<br />\n<br />\nOne key to healthy eating is<br />\nkeeping a clean and properly equipped<br />\nkitchen. If the sink is piled high with<br />\ndirty dishes then the temptation to grab<br />\nsome quick processed food, rather<br />\nthan clean a pot to cook, leads to expensive and unhealthy eating habits. Keep a<br />\ngood sized saucepan and fry pan on hand<br />\nand clean at all times. Also keep the<br />\nbroiler clean, because it is much healthier<br />\nto broil food than to fry it.

After a trying day, it's so much easier just to hit the Homewood Deli, or throw<br />\nsome frozen macaroni and cheese in the toaster oven, than it is to put some serious<br />\neffort into producing a healthy meal.<br />\nWell, it doesn't have to be that way.

It was costing a<br />\nfortune to eat very badly. \"Well, you can count me out,\" I said. \"I'm gonna throw<br />\nsome stuff together at home. Anyone want to join me?\"<br />\nIt was like magic.<br />\n\"Hey, yeah, I'll bring some tofu.\"<br />\n\"I've got some kielbassa left over from Orientation Week.\"<br />\n\"We'll bring the National Boll...\"<br />\nIn a space of minutes, the Fencing Team Mobile Eating Co-op had been born.<br />\nIt made so much sense that one felt like pinching oneself for not having thought of it<br />\nsooner. We all had the same late afternoon schedules. We all more or less liked each<br />\nother (this is an important consideration in an eating co-op--the sight of the person<br />\nsitting across from you should not adversely affect your enjoyment of the meal). We<br />\nall preferred eating good food with a group of friends in a nice living room to eating<br />\neither mediocre and expensive restaurant food or eating hastily slapped-together glop<br />\nalone. The only obstacles were keeping the finances straight, and making sure the<br />\nfood was on time, so that everyone could get back to the library to study.<br />\nAs our many friends, roommates, dinner-guests, and admirers now know,the<br />\nFencing Team Mobile Eating Co-op was a major success. For nearly two and a half<br />\nmonths, before finals and the end of fencing season laid it to rest, the co-op averaged<br />\nbetween six and ten members at any given meal. Two members cooked each night,<br />\nas the meals moved from house to house. Generally, the cooks picked days when<br />\nthey had light schedules, so that dinner was on the table by 6:30 or 7:00. There was<br />\na spending ceiling of $3.00 per person, and instead of getting reimbursed for expenses, each person simply relied on the knowledge that he could eat comparable<br />\nfare for free on the other four weekday nights. The meals were always decent and<br />\nsometimes amazing--spaghetti and clam sauce was the most ordinary dish ever served,<br />\nand sweet and sour duck, prepared by the now-legendary David Nover, was the piece<br />\nde resistance of a surprisingly nourishing semester.<br />\nThere was only one serious problem with the co-op, and indeed, it was one<br />\nthat we never quite overcame. No matter how early the meal was on the table, eaten.<br />\nand cleaned up after, we never seemed to leave until 9:00. Everyone was having too<br />\ngood a time. The atmosphere was treacherously convivial.<br />\nIs there a fencing team co-op out there for you?

Its University funding consists<br />\nonly of a single work-study managerial position held this year by Sam Telford; aside<br />\nfrom that it is self-supporting.<br />\nIndividuals or households who wish to join the co-op must pay a $5 membership fee and agree to work three two-hour shifts each semester. In a threeperson household that means 2 hours of work and about S1.70 per person each<br />\nsemester.<br />\nAt the Homewood Garage your order will have been picked up, filled and<br />\nbagged by the co-op members who are fulfilling part of their time agreement.<br />\nPayment can be made by cash or check.<br />\nBrand name products, such as Dannon yogurt (15 flavors!) and Spruce Tree<br />\nbreads are available at the co-op. But by and large the items are \"generic\"--bought<br />\nin b-ulk and without packaging frills.<br />\nFor your palate's pleasure there are: seven different kinds of bread: veggies<br />\nranging from avocados to zucchini; goods for gorp (peanuts, sunflower seeds, and<br />\nraisins); and the ingredients for an Italian gourmet meal, without the meat. Cheese<br />\nis one of the better bargains, since it is bought by the wheel and cut at the co-op.<br />\nFruits are available in season, so order what you will and the co-op will try to get it<br />\nfor you.

While the Rec<br />\nCenter is supported by city funds, private organizations and area<br />\nresidents play a large role in providing the financial support and<br />\nmanpower needed to run the Center. Peacock points out that \"it<br />\nis just ordinary citizens who devote their time for raising money\"<br />\nto keep the Rec alive.<br />\nGreater Homewood: The Greater Homewood Community Council, which serves as an \"umbrella\" organization--helping<br />\ncoordinate the efforts of some of the smaller area associations-will focus on the Action in Maturity (AIM) program for their<br />\nbooth at the Fair. Run by a volunteer corps of neighborhood<br />\nresidents, AIM organizes arts and crafts classes, trips, lectures and<br />\nmeetings for senior citizens living in the area.

The article slated<br />\nthat the \"Academic Council<br />\nmembers felt the results did not<br />\nconstitute overwhelming enough<br />\nopposition to justify dropping<br />\nthe plan, especially in light of<br />\nthe lower than expected turnout.\" Since there was absolutely<br />\nno turnout, the decision of the<br />\nAcademic Council may have<br />\nbeen based on faulty information. Also, the above quotation<br />\nmentioned<br />\n\"overwhelming<br />\nenough opposition.\" This implies that the opposition was,<br />\nindeed, overwhelming but not<br />\noverwhelming enough for the<br />\ntaste of the Academic Council. I<br />\nam certain that the Academic<br />\nCouncil would, in light of an<br />\nactual overwhelming vote, take<br />\ninto serious consideration the<br />\nwishes of the student body. By<br />\nthe way, a survey was taken by<br />\nthe Student Council last semester on the subject of plus/minus<br />\ngrading.

And<br />\nthis is why we are today in the<br />\nmidst of one of the largest<br />\nmerger waves in U.S. history.<br />\nDuPont had no trouble last<br />\nmonth in finding the S7.8 billion<br />\nnecessary to take over Conoco,<br />\nbut this massive investment<br />\nproduced not one job.<br />\nNo. The problem for the<br />\nbig corporations is not to get<br />\ntheir hands on more capital so<br />\nmuch as it is to find profitable<br />\nand productive investments.<br />\nThey can make a higher return<br />\nin the money market or in<br />\nforeign investments than they<br />\ncan investing in steel or cars in<br />\nthe U.S. Thus in 1980, Ford<br />\nclosed part of a large assembly<br />\nplant near Cleveland, costing<br />\n5,000. jobs, while it also announced plans for a new $350<br />\nmillion plant in Mexico. Capital<br />\nis being invested abroad where<br />\nwages are lower.<br />\nTo paraphrase a famous<br />\nsaying, you can supply capital to<br />\na capitalist, but you can't make<br />\nhim invest in jobs. The crisis is<br />\ndue not to a lack of capital<br />\ninvestment but to low profit<br />\nrates throughout much of the<br />\neconomy.<br />\nBefore investment<br />\nwill take place, you have to<br />\nmake it profitable to produce<br />\ncars or steel again in the U.S.<br />\nLittle wonder, then, that<br /><br />\nSocial Security budget is being<br />\ncut, and positively obese are<br />\nwelfare recipients, whose benefits are being reduced by 30<br />\npercent.<br />\nWho are the thin people<br />\nwho benefit from the tax cuts?<br />\nWell, businesses are due for a<br />\ndirect tax break of S150 billion,<br />\nand of the remainder going to<br />\nindividuals, the majority will go<br />\nto individuals investing in business. It will come in the form of<br />\ncuts in investment tax, foreign<br />\nearnings taxes, estate taxes,<br />\ncapital gains taxes, gift taxes,<br />\nFor<br />\ntaxes on home sales.<br />\nexample, a two-income family of<br />\nfour will get all of S69 knocked<br />\noff their 1982 taxes if they earn<br />\nS10,000. But if the same family<br />\nearned 10 times as much<br />\n(S100,000), they would get 40<br />\ntimes as much in a tax break<br />\n($2749).<br />\nThis is Reagan's famed and<br />\nfashionable \"supply-side economics.\" In theory it works<br />\nlike this. First you reduce taxes,<br />\nleaving more capital in the hands<br />\nof the capitalists, thereby encouraging them to invest in more<br />\nfactories, the production of<br />\nmore commodities, and eventually the employment of more<br />\nworkers. This greater production would in turn raise the total<br />\ntax revenue despite the lowered<br />\ntax rate. The result? Eternal<br />\nprosperity for all, with tax<br />\ncollectors being the only unemployed.<br />\nBut in practice, the theory<br />\nwill not `work quite so perfectly.<br />\nIn the first place, much of<br />\nReagan's program was already<br />\nimplemented by Thatcher in<br />\nBritain, where it has been an<br />\nunmitigated failure.<br />\nUnemployment is more than 12<br />\npercent, and the conditions for<br />\ncapital investment are so bad,<br />\nthat the Confederation for<br />\nBritish Industry--the large corporate owners and managers--has<br />\nfor the last six months attacked<br />\nThatcher as \"ruinous\"for Britain.<br /><br />\ncont. on p. 9<br />\n77eE<br />\ncz, A aEAA.<br />\n.<br />\n/01Cts-'7\"; MOST INTR/641M/G MERE<br />\n81-STS,SoLITARY<br />\nS71.EN-7; 5A,46 COn/VS.<br /><br />\n\\<br />\ntc_/<br /><br />\notocE 4.mt.LE<br /><br />\nKeith Jones<br />\nChairman<br />\nElections Commission<br /><br />\nAND NoRfnAL, Like '710.44.<br /><br />\n14.,e/q6 ART\"V<br />\n/1-1PLe AND com -l; LiArriZ.<br /><br />\n7.iet<br /><br />\n--/ReRcueRot&lt;5 A\u20227,-c.a2z5<br />\n.4Deo /4P70<br />\n7-/z\u2018<br /><br />\nPunk Lives<br /><br />\nY Lite&amp; \u2022 \u2022<br /><br />\nTo the Editor:<br />\nI must politely rebut the<br />\nSeptember<br />\n11<br />\nNews-Letter<br />\narticle concerning Baltimore's<br />\nnightclubs.

In this light, supply<br />\nside economics doesn't look<br />\nmuch different from conventional economic theories of supply<br />\nand demand.

Fortunately, most college.<br />\naged people are healthy enough to<br />\nwithstand the irregular eating habits that<br />\nare a natural component of college<br />\nlife. But cooking for oneself doesn't have<br />\nto be the task that so many sophomores,<br />\njuniors, and seniors seem to find it. It is<br />\npossible to keep a clean kitchen, eat<br />\nregularly, and even maintain a nutritionally balanced diet without expending<br />\nmuch time, energy, or money.

If the sink is piled high with<br />\ndirty dishes then the temptation to grab<br />\nsome quick processed food, rather<br />\nthan clean a pot to cook, leads to expensive and unhealthy eating habits. Keep a<br />\ngood sized saucepan and fry pan on hand<br />\nand clean at all times. Also keep the<br />\nbroiler clean, because it is much healthier<br />\nto broil food than to fry it.

We all had the same late afternoon schedules. We all more or less liked each<br />\nother (this is an important consideration in an eating co-op--the sight of the person<br />\nsitting across from you should not adversely affect your enjoyment of the meal). We<br />\nall preferred eating good food with a group of friends in a nice living room to eating<br />\neither mediocre and expensive restaurant food or eating hastily slapped-together glop<br />\nalone. The only obstacles were keeping the finances straight, and making sure the<br />\nfood was on time, so that everyone could get back to the library to study.<br />\nAs our many friends, roommates, dinner-guests, and admirers now know,the<br />\nFencing Team Mobile Eating Co-op was a major success. For nearly two and a half<br />\nmonths, before finals and the end of fencing season laid it to rest, the co-op averaged<br />\nbetween six and ten members at any given meal. Two members cooked each night,<br />\nas the meals moved from house to house. Generally, the cooks picked days when<br />\nthey had light schedules, so that dinner was on the table by 6:30 or 7:00. There was<br />\na spending ceiling of $3.00 per person, and instead of getting reimbursed for expenses, each person simply relied on the knowledge that he could eat comparable<br />\nfare for free on the other four weekday nights. The meals were always decent and<br />\nsometimes amazing--spaghetti and clam sauce was the most ordinary dish ever served,<br />\nand sweet and sour duck, prepared by the now-legendary David Nover, was the piece<br />\nde resistance of a surprisingly nourishing semester.<br />\nThere was only one serious problem with the co-op, and indeed, it was one<br />\nthat we never quite overcame. No matter how early the meal was on the table, eaten.<br />\nand cleaned up after, we never seemed to leave until 9:00. Everyone was having too<br />\ngood a time. The atmosphere was treacherously convivial.<br />\nIs there a fencing team co-op out there for you?

Its University funding consists<br />\nonly of a single work-study managerial position held this year by Sam Telford; aside<br />\nfrom that it is self-supporting.<br />\nIndividuals or households who wish to join the co-op must pay a $5 membership fee and agree to work three two-hour shifts each semester. In a threeperson household that means 2 hours of work and about S1.70 per person each<br />\nsemester.<br />\nAt the Homewood Garage your order will have been picked up, filled and<br />\nbagged by the co-op members who are fulfilling part of their time agreement.<br />\nPayment can be made by cash or check.<br />\nBrand name products, such as Dannon yogurt (15 flavors!) and Spruce Tree<br />\nbreads are available at the co-op. But by and large the items are \"generic\"--bought<br />\nin b-ulk and without packaging frills.<br />\nFor your palate's pleasure there are: seven different kinds of bread: veggies<br />\nranging from avocados to zucchini; goods for gorp (peanuts, sunflower seeds, and<br />\nraisins); and the ingredients for an Italian gourmet meal, without the meat. Cheese<br />\nis one of the better bargains, since it is bought by the wheel and cut at the co-op.<br />\nFruits are available in season, so order what you will and the co-op will try to get it<br />\nfor you.

The exhibit is<br />\nprimarily comprised of the Dutch artist's<br />\nwatercolors and sketches which were<br />\nseminal for Modern Art. Assembled for<br />\nits Baltimore opening on July 12, the<br />\ncollection will not be seen anywhere else<br />\nin the United States before the works are<br />\nshipped back to their permanent homes<br />\nin the Netherlands, Germany, and New<br />\nYork.<br />\nThe truly fascinating aspect of<br />\nthis exhibit is its thoroughly retrospective<br />\nnature: we see a marked progression<br />\nfrom his earlier naturalistic work of the<br />\nHague School to a form which,in its final<br />\nstages, is credited entirely to his genius;<br />\nhe termed this form \"neo-plasticism.\"<br />\nIt is essentially the foundation of modern<br />\nabstract art, and Modrian lived and died<br />\nsolely for its emergence. He had an<br />\nencompassing. artistic vision and philosophy which took all of his 72 years to<br />\nemerge fully.<br />\nMondrian was born on March 7,<br />\n1872 in Amersfoort, the Netherlands.<br />\nHis father was an amateur painter and<br />\nheadmaster of a Dutch Reformed primary<br />\nschool; this accounts for Mondrian's<br />\ninitial introduction to art and also his<br />\nThe Calvinist<br />\npuritanical upbringing.<br />\ninfluence is important since it built the<br />\nfoundation for the young man's eventual<br />\nphilosophy; he sought to attain a spirituality in his art. Yet, to attain the particular essence for which he was striving he<br />\nhad to deviate from the purely naturalistic art of the Hague School--his formal<br />\neducation--and he was unfairly chastised<br />\nfor this. He knew from the outset that<br />\nhis art would have to transcend realism.<br />\nThe philosophy of Mondrian's life<br /><br />\nwas summed up by the slogan \"always<br />\nfurther.\" Every work he created set the<br />\nbasis, in an unwavering progression, for<br />\nhis subsequent efforts. We see in his<br />\nnature studies the very burgeoning of his<br />\nneo-plastic elements: the color is generally subdued and the form is vivified, a<br />\nform less concerned with the fortuitousness and temporality of nature i.han with<br />\nits primary design and basic structure. He<br />\nuses reflection in many of these works; a<br />\nhouse or forest set at the foot of a lake,<br />\nfor example. Though this technique was<br />\nnot unusual at the time, Mondrian's<br />\nunique contribution is its particular<br />\nthe reflection is used to<br />\nemphasis:<br />\namplify and consolidate the form, to give<br />\nit structural support.<br />\nTwo important images for Mondrian were windmills and trees. Three<br />\nworks depicting windmills in the exhibition, provide an intriguing illustration of<br />\nMondrian's progressive focus on form: an<br />\ninterest in delicate detail is seen in the<br />\nfirst, less so in the second, and in the oil<br />\npainting this detail has given way to<br />\nabsolutely stark contrast between mill<br />\n(totally black) and the sky and clouds<br />\n(pastel). The final image of the mill is<br />\nthrust by its structural purity into the<br />\nnatural setting.<br />\nAs Mondrian's philosophy began<br />\nto develop further, he saw that the<br /><br />\nMondrian\u2014before he jousted with windmills<br />\nstructure of objects, natural and artificial, approach the spiritual in art, one employs<br />\ncould be broken down primarily to lines. reality as little as possible because reality<br />\nHe began to experiment in reducing art to is the polar opposite of the spiritual.<br />\nthese lines of form, of structure.
