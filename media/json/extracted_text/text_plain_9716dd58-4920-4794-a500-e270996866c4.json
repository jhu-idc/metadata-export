The<br />\ncompetition for students has hurt<br />\nthe private schools, who, after<br />\nlarge programs of expansion,<br />\nmust enroll enough students in<br />\norder to generate sufficient funds<br />\nfor their operation.<br />\nHopkins, Owen asserted, has<br />\nnot needed to initiate the drastic<br />\nmeasures that other schools<br />\nthroughout the country have,<br />\nbecause, unlike these schools,<br />\nHopkins has \"been cautious in its<br />\nexpansion programs\" over the<br />\npast five years.<br />\nMany private Universities have<br />\nexpanded on the expectation of<br />\nfuture federal funding, and are<br />\nfinding the going rough now that<br />\nfederal funds are slowly drying<br />\nup. Owen stated. \"Building on<br />\nexpectations of Federal funding<br />\nis dangerous,\" he remarked.<br />\nWith a permanent upward<br />\nswing of the economy still in the<br />\ndistant future, Owen admitted<br />\nthat Hopkins may one day have<br />\nto take its lumps along with the<br />\nrest of the world of higher<br />\neducation.<br />\nIn this regard, President Muller<br />\nwill meet with the entire<br />\nUniversity faculty in order to<br />\n<br />\nUnion Board votes to coordinate<br />\nBy BOB DANNER<br />\nThe Union Board voted<br />\nWednesday to coordinate its<br />\nsocial programming with the<br />\nStudent Council and other<br />\ncampus organizations in an effort<br />\nto eliminate scheduling conflicts<br />\nand program duplication.<br />\nThe panel also elected<br />\nsophomore member Steve<br />\nAbrams to serve as interim<br />\nchairman until next Fall, when<br />\nthe new Board will selects its<br />\nown head.<br />\n\"I think coordinating<br />\nprogramming is a very strong step<br />\nin the right direction.

WARREN<br />\nand<br />\nJOE RODR1GUE<br />\n<br />\ndivided they'll fall<br />\n<br />\nwaitin' for the bus<br />\n<br />\nWe note with some surprise that the Union Governing<br />\nBoard,in its present incarnation as the \"Union Board,- has<br />\nundertaken new plans for social programming in an apparent<br />\neffort to further alter the panel's always uncertain scope of<br />\nresponsibility and authority. If this latest effort<br />\nat cooperation falls by the wayside, we think that the Board<br />\nshould do the same. There is no student-faculty committee<br />\nthat has been so unsure of its purpose, so unstable in its<br />\nmembership, and so incapable of discharging the petty matters<br />\nthat fall under its direction.<br />\nThe Board was originally charged with supervising the<br />\ncompletion of the Union and making decisions about which<br />\nfrills would be eliminated, and making recommendations on<br />\nthings like decor and priorities. With the completion of the<br />\nUnion behind it, the Board then took on its shoulders the<br />\nduty of deciding who would use what rooms in the Union<br />\nand when. the product of this was the well-known \"Room<br />\nUse Priority Report.\"<br />\nIt appears that the Board has now outlived its usefulness.<br />\nwhenever it tries to do something, it gets in the way of a<br />\npre-existirig structure. Its social programming conflicted with<br />\nthat of the Student Council Social Committee. It couldn't do<br />\nmuch about the design of a building that was already built.<br />\nThe de fare merger of the Board with other social<br />\nprogrammers on campus, most notably the SC Social<br />\nCommittee, seems to use the first logical step in the<br />\nelimination of the panel. There is no need to have one Board<br />\ncontrol scheduling of one building. (Would you believe \"the<br />\nShriver Hall Governing Board.\") And with all construction<br />\ndone and priorities established, this most notorious of all<br />\n\"committees\" would be well advised to go the way of all<br />\nflesh.<br />\n<br />\nNow what is this thing you want<br />\nus to look into? The Theater<br />\nProject. So what about it? They<br />\nhave free shows.. What kind of<br />\nshows? I don't know.That's why I<br />\nwant you to check it out.

Just do it!<br />\nWhen you haven't got anyone<br />\nelse to pass the buck to, you go<br />\nahead and do it. Waiting for the<br />\nbus in front of Hopkins isn't really<br />\nthat bad. There's a nice bench to<br />\nSit on, and study the statue while<br />\nthe cars go by-barrel!, barrel!,<br />\nvroom, zoom. Sometimes even a<br />\nperson will walk by. But they<br />\nnever talk to you. They just look<br />\n<br />\nat you while pretending not to.<br />\nwhich is what you're doing to<br />\nthem.<br />\n\"Where's the bus?\"<br />\nSometimes you wonder if this is<br />\nthe day they stopped running<br />\nthem. Who really likes busses<br />\nanyway'? They're usually dirty and<br />\nthey get more expensive every<br />\nyear.

A<br />\ndoubleheader loss to Loyola<br />\nyesterday, combined with a 6-4<br />\ndefeat earlier in the week at the<br />\nhands of Lebanon Valley,<br />\nextended the Hopkins losing<br />\nstreak to five games. All three<br />\nlosses this week were at home<br />\nIn the opener of the twin-bill<br />\nwith the Greyhounds, the Blue<br />\nJays blew a comfortable 6-2 lead<br />\nin the top of the sixth inning,<br />\ncombining mental errors with<br />\npitching that faltered, only one<br />\nframe from victory. That inning<br />\nsaw Loyola come up with eight<br />\nruns, five of which crossed the<br />\nplate with two men away.<br />\nRun Production<br />\nHopkins jumped on top<br />\nquickly in game one, coming up<br />\nwith a run in the first.<br />\nThird-baseman Tom Pedroni hit<br />\nthe first pitch safely into left<br />\nfield for a single and was doubled<br />\nhome by first-baseman John<br />\nJerabeck. The Jays added two in<br />\nthe second on singles by Larry<br />\nSantoro, Jim Duffy, Dave<br />\nLewing, and Lou Podrazik. The<br />\nrun production continued for<br />\nHopkins as they scored once<br />\nagain in the third and twice in<br />\n<br />\nTennis team extends streak to 5<br />\nBy GARY SWIMMER<br />\nThe Hopkins tennis team<br />\nsucceeded in defeating all three<br />\nof their opponents this week to<br />\nbring their winning streak to five<br />\nin a row and lift their season<br />\nrecord to 8 and 5.<br />\nAt the start of the week, the<br />\ntennis players pounded UMBC<br />\n8-1 on a windy day at their<br />\nopponent's courts. Tuesday they<br />\nswept through Loyola 5-4 in a<br />\nclose match that was almost a<br />\ncarbon copy of their first<br />\nconfrontation, and Wednesday,<br />\nthe Blue Jays faced Washington<br />\nCollege and blitzed the Shoremen<br />\n9-0.<br />\nAlthough they lost at first<br />\nsingles, last Monday's win at<br />\nUMBC was an example of the<br />\ndepth and, strong mid-season<br />\nform of the Hopkins team. Jeff<br />\nGould led the way at second<br />\nsingles resoundingly thrashing his<br />\nopponent 6-2, 6-4. Captain John<br />\nNewman also had an easy time,<br />\nwinning 6-1, 6-3 at third singles.<br />\nSophomore Chuck McCulloch<br />\nadded another win to his<br />\nimpressive record with his 6-3,6-3<br />\nwin. Junior Gary Swimmer was<br />\n<br />\nthe first to walk off the courts<br />\nafter a quick, crushing 6-0, 6-3<br />\nvictory.<br />\nDoubles wins by<br />\nNomady-Newman, who won 7-5,<br />\n6-2, Gould-Swimmer, who<br />\noutlasted their opponents in<br />\nthree sets 5-7, 6-3, 6-2, and the<br />\n\"tall man\" doubles combination<br />\nof McCulloch\u2014Little rounded<br />\nout the doubles sweep 6-2, 6-3,<br />\nled Hopkins to an 8-1 victory.<br />\nThe next day, in an<br />\nemotion-packed grudge match,<br />\nLoyola was again outplayed by<br />\nthe Blue Jay racketeers. Once<br />\nagain the score was 3-3 at the end<br />\nof the singles matches.<br />\nFirst and third doubles walked<br />\noff without offsetting the tie<br />\nscore which was now 4-4 thanks<br />\nto McColloch -Little's quick win<br />\nof 6-4, 6-2. Again, the pressure<br />\nwas on Gould-Swimmer who had<br />\nbeaten these rivals in a third set<br />\ntie-breaker in their last meeting.<br />\nThis time the victory came easier.<br />\nWith better weather and a home<br />\ncrowd, Swimmer-Gould put a lid<br />\non the match by winning 6-1,<br />\n3-6, 6-2.<br />\nWednesday, against<br />\n<br />\nWashington College, Hopkins<br />\ntennis was in top form. Rich<br />\nNomady emerged from what he<br />\ncalled an \"acute case of the<br />\nslump\" to win at first singles 6-4,<br />\n6-3. Later, Nomady pointed to<br />\nhis upsurge in aggression and the<br />\nfact that he was taking his shots<br />\nmuch e4er as the reasons for his<br />\nsuccess.<br />\nCoach Robert Hughes<br />\nexpressed great pleasure with the<br />\nteam's performance this past<br />\nweek. Much of the team's success<br />\ncan be attributed to the<br />\ninnovative leadership of their<br />\nnew coach. Hughes, a dean at the<br />\nSchool of Health Services, is a<br />\nfine player in his own right and<br />\nappears largely responsible for<br />\nthe newfound cohesion and<br />\ndevelopment of the team's<br />\npotential.<br />\n<br />\nAtm..<br />\n<br />\ndefeat by Russ Lindner's<br />\nexceptional score of 76 on the<br />\ndemanding course. The 76 was<br />\nthe lowest competitive round of<br />\nthe season and the team's lowest<br />\nas well. He was followed in<br />\nscoring by Joe Arminio with an<br />\n86, Frank Healey with an 88,<br />\nMike Deak with an 89 and Bob<br />\nSchiemel with a 90.<br />\nTowson<br />\nThe Hopkins golfers were<br />\nagain defeated on Monday in a<br />\nmatch against the Towson State<br />\nCollege golf team on the Tigers<br />\nhome course. The team scores<br />\nwere Towson State-412, and<br />\nJ HU 424. Russ Lindner and<br />\nFrank Healey were the low<br />\nscorers for the Blue Jays with<br />\n<br />\nthe fourth, but it turned out not<br />\nto be enough.<br />\nStarting pitcher Phil<br />\nBurlington was effective in his<br />\nopening five innings of work,<br />\ngetting picked on in the third for<br />\ntwo runs, one of which was<br />\nunearned. It was the sixth inning<br />\nthat proved to be fatal for the<br />\nJays. It all started with<br />\nBurlington failing to cover on a<br />\nground ball between first base<br />\nand the mound. After three runs<br />\nwere in and two men away,<br />\nPedroni picked up a dribbler near<br />\nthe third base line, a ball that<br />\nwould have rolled foul, and was<br />\nunable to make a play at first.<br />\nFollowing the error, Loyola<br />\nmanaged to load the bases and<br />\nclear them hopping on reliever<br />\nBill Jones for two singles and a<br />\ntriple. Before the sixth ended,<br />\ntwo more would score and leave<br />\nHopkins four runs down at 10-6.<br />\nThe game ended with that total<br />\non the board.<br />\nIn the nightcap, Loyola tallied<br />\nseven times in the first two<br />\ninnings, knocking starter Ed<br />\nChory out after only one and a<br />\nthird. Hopkins committed seven<br />\nerrors in the ball game causing<br />\neight of Loyola's eleven runs to<br />\nbe unearned.

Worthington Valley<br />\nCountry Club.<br />\n<br />\nCollege. but took control in the<br />\nsecond quarter and proceeded to<br />\ncrush Essex 13-5.<br />\nThe first quarter was a fairly<br />\neven match. Essex displayed fine<br />\nstick-handling on both sides of<br />\nthe field and maintained pressure<br />\non the Hopkins goal. The Baby<br />\nJays for their part threw away<br />\nseveral scoring opportunities<br />\nalthough they were still able to<br />\nconvert twice. on goals from<br />\nDoober Aburn and Carl Yeich.<br />\n. Stickwork<br />\nHopkins' woes were not<br />\nconfined to offense alone.<br />\nDefensively, stickwork and<br />\nclearing seemed to be the Baby<br />\nJays' major problem. As he has<br />\ndone in many of the Baby Jays'<br />\ngames, Goalie Jay Trainor was<br />\nable to keep the team in the<br />\ngame pulling in eight saves and<br />\nonly allowing two goals during<br />\nthe quarter. He total 31 saves for<br />\nthe game!<br />\nThe story changed in the<br />\nsecond period. With 1:04 elapsed<br />\nin the quarter, Hopkins' PJ Boyle<br />\n<br />\npicked up a loose ball and<br />\nhummed in a goal to put the<br />\nBaby Jays ahead 3-2. From there<br />\non in, the game belonged to<br />\nHopkins. Tom Cirillo, Doober<br />\nAburn, and Joe Devlin popped in<br />\nthree quick goals at the end of<br />\nthe quarter to give the Baby Jays<br />\na 6-2 edge at the half.<br />\nThe third quarter began with<br />\nEssex scoring first on a goal by J.<br />\nWebbert, as the E\u2014men tried to<br />\nreverse the tide of the game.<br />\nTheir hopes were dashed quickly,<br />\nhowever, as Joe Devlin scored a<br />\nminute later on a feed from Carl<br />\nYeich. The Baby Jays scored<br />\nthree more times in the third<br />\nquarter, on 'two goals by Tom<br />\nCirillo and another by Devlin.<br />\nIn the fourth quarter, the<br />\nBaby Jays ended their scoring<br />\nspree with two goals by PJ Boyle<br />\nand one by Doober Aburn.<br />\nThe Baby Jays play Anne<br />\nArundel Community College<br />\ntoday'at 3 on the varsity practice<br />\nfield to kick-off the Spring Fair<br />\nWeekend.<br />\n<br />\n\fpage 12/news-letter/april 24, 1975<br />\n<br />\nPeople's Free Medical Clinic celebrates its fifth b-day<br />\nBy RUSS SMITH<br />\nThe People's Free Medical<br />\nClinic, located at 3028<br />\nGreenmount Avenue, will<br />\ncelebrate it's fifth anniversary<br />\nduring the week of April 28-May<br />\n4. Some of the events the Clinic<br />\nwill sponsor are as follows:<br />\nOpen house at the clinic<br />\nweek-noon to 5 pm.<br />\niy,<br />\nSquare Dance April<br />\nJHU, Great Hall<br />\nCaller\u2014Bob Dalsemer.<br />\nDonation $2.00<br />\nAuction\u2014May 2,7:30 pm<br />\nSt. John's Church<br />\n27th and St. Paul<br />\nStreet Festival\u2014 May 3<br />\n11:00 am-5:30 pm<br />\nVineyard and 30th<br />\nLive music and crafts<br />\nThe Clinic operates under the<br />\nprinciple that \"health care is a<br />\nright, not a privilege,\" and serves<br />\napproximately 7 500<br />\nWaverly-Charles Village residents<br />\neacy year. Composed of more<br />\nthan 100 professiona.1 and<br />\nnon-professional volunteers, the<br />\nClinic staff offers \"general<br />\nmedical care, gynecological<br />\nservices, pediatrics, dental<br />\nservices, early pregnancy<br />\ndetection, and abortion<br />\ncounseling and referral.\"<br />\nSince its inception, the Clinic<br />\nhas slowly expanded its services<br />\nand now occupies three adjoining<br />\nrowhouses. Presently, the Clinic<br />\nis divided into two sections, one<br />\nfor medical service, the other for<br />\ncounseling.<br />\n<br />\nEach time a patient comes to<br />\nthe Clinic he is attended to by<br />\nthe same \"advocate\" as the staff<br />\nstrongly believes that \"continuity<br />\nof care\" is essential. The<br />\nadvocate is responsible for the<br />\ngeneral supervision of his patients<br />\nand it is he who \"ties everything<br />\ntogether.\"<br />\nThe Clinic, which is open four<br />\nnights a week (Monday through<br />\nThursday, 6:30-10:30). has a<br />\ndifferent staff for each night.<br />\nThere is always one doctor in<br />\nattendence. along with nurses,<br />\ncounselors, advocates, lab<br />\ntechnicians, and \"behind the<br />\n<br />\nThe People's Free Medical Clinic<br />\nscenes\" workers. Because of thie<br />\narrangement, each staff forms an<br />\nidentity and works closely with<br />\neach other. A unique facet of the<br />\nClinic's spirit is the integration of<br />\njobs and reponsibilities. For<br />\nexample, if a nurse is not<br />\navailable, a qualified member<br />\nwith a different function of the<br />\nstaff will substitute.<br />\nThe counseling division of the<br />\nClinic has two primary functions:<br />\ngeneral counseling for emotional<br />\nand physical needs and -women's<br />\ncounseling. People coming to the<br />\nclinic for counseling are dealt<br />\nwith on a one to one basis and all<br />\n<br />\ninformation taken by counselors<br />\nis kept confidential.<br />\nThe counselors also give<br />\npregnancy tests and offer<br />\ninformation about abortion and<br />\nvenereal disease. The counseling<br />\nsection is not limited to residents<br />\nof the Waverly\u2014Charles Village<br />\narea,(unlike the medical service)<br />\nand will assist anyone in need.<br />\nBecause the Clinic operates<br />\nunder the premise that health<br />\ncare should not be dependent on<br />\na patient's ability to pay, funds<br />\nmust be obtained from sources<br />\nother than patient fees. Much of<br />\nthe Clinic's annual $30,000<br />\n<br />\nbudget is gotten from donations<br />\nand monthly pledges provided by<br />\npatients and members of the<br />\ncommunity.<br />\nApparently, however, the<br />\nClinic's ties with Hopkins are not<br />\nas productive as they could be.,'<br />\nMany Hopkins students volunteer<br />\nto work at the Clinic, but they<br />\nusually don't commit themselves<br />\nfor a long duration, according to<br />\none worker there. The Clinic is<br />\nhesitant to treat Hopkins<br />\nstudents who seek medical<br />\nattention. The Clinic's staff<br />\nbelieves that students at Hopkins<br />\nshould rely on the Brown<br />\nInfirmary for care, so as not to<br />\ndeprive the community residents<br />\nwho have nowhere else to go. In<br />\nsituations where a_ student does<br />\nnot receive adequate attention at<br />\nBrown Infirmary, the Clinic will<br />\naccept students as patients. For<br />\nexample, Brown Infirmary will<br />\nnot treat cases of venereal<br />\ndisease, say the Clinic workers.<br />\nThe People's Free Medical<br />\nClinic is probably the most<br />\nsignificant exhibition of<br />\ncommunity interaction in the<br />\nWaverly\u2014Charles Village<br />\nneighborhood. Although growing<br />\nconstantly, the Clinic needs more<br />\ndoctors and contributions.<br />\nPeople interested in seeing how<br />\nthe Clinic works are encouraged<br />\nto drop by weekday nights.

Not only<br />\nis weather in the northeast more<br />\nsevere, but natural gas<br />\nsupplies\u2014three time cheaper<br /><br />\nthan oil\u2014 are not available to<br />\nmost schools above New Jersey.<br />\nAccording to Dean of Arts and<br />\nSciences George Owen, nearly all<br />\nof. the institutions of higher<br />\neducation are experiencing severe<br />\nfinancial difficulty.

WARREN<br />\nand<br />\nJOE RODR1GUE<br /><br />\ndivided they'll fall<br /><br />\nwaitin' for the bus<br /><br />\nWe note with some surprise that the Union Governing<br />\nBoard,in its present incarnation as the \"Union Board,- has<br />\nundertaken new plans for social programming in an apparent<br />\neffort to further alter the panel's always uncertain scope of<br />\nresponsibility and authority. If this latest effort<br />\nat cooperation falls by the wayside, we think that the Board<br />\nshould do the same. There is no student-faculty committee<br />\nthat has been so unsure of its purpose, so unstable in its<br />\nmembership, and so incapable of discharging the petty matters<br />\nthat fall under its direction.<br />\nThe Board was originally charged with supervising the<br />\ncompletion of the Union and making decisions about which<br />\nfrills would be eliminated, and making recommendations on<br />\nthings like decor and priorities. With the completion of the<br />\nUnion behind it, the Board then took on its shoulders the<br />\nduty of deciding who would use what rooms in the Union<br />\nand when. the product of this was the well-known \"Room<br />\nUse Priority Report.\"<br />\nIt appears that the Board has now outlived its usefulness.<br />\nwhenever it tries to do something, it gets in the way of a<br />\npre-existirig structure. Its social programming conflicted with<br />\nthat of the Student Council Social Committee. It couldn't do<br />\nmuch about the design of a building that was already built.<br />\nThe de fare merger of the Board with other social<br />\nprogrammers on campus, most notably the SC Social<br />\nCommittee, seems to use the first logical step in the<br />\nelimination of the panel. There is no need to have one Board<br />\ncontrol scheduling of one building. (Would you believe \"the<br />\nShriver Hall Governing Board.\") And with all construction<br />\ndone and priorities established, this most notorious of all<br />\n\"committees\" would be well advised to go the way of all<br />\nflesh.<br /><br />\nNow what is this thing you want<br />\nus to look into? The Theater<br />\nProject. So what about it? They<br />\nhave free shows.. What kind of<br />\nshows? I don't know.That's why I<br />\nwant you to check it out.

A<br />\ndoubleheader loss to Loyola<br />\nyesterday, combined with a 6-4<br />\ndefeat earlier in the week at the<br />\nhands of Lebanon Valley,<br />\nextended the Hopkins losing<br />\nstreak to five games. All three<br />\nlosses this week were at home<br />\nIn the opener of the twin-bill<br />\nwith the Greyhounds, the Blue<br />\nJays blew a comfortable 6-2 lead<br />\nin the top of the sixth inning,<br />\ncombining mental errors with<br />\npitching that faltered, only one<br />\nframe from victory. That inning<br />\nsaw Loyola come up with eight<br />\nruns, five of which crossed the<br />\nplate with two men away.<br />\nRun Production<br />\nHopkins jumped on top<br />\nquickly in game one, coming up<br />\nwith a run in the first.<br />\nThird-baseman Tom Pedroni hit<br />\nthe first pitch safely into left<br />\nfield for a single and was doubled<br />\nhome by first-baseman John<br />\nJerabeck. The Jays added two in<br />\nthe second on singles by Larry<br />\nSantoro, Jim Duffy, Dave<br />\nLewing, and Lou Podrazik. The<br />\nrun production continued for<br />\nHopkins as they scored once<br />\nagain in the third and twice in<br /><br />\nTennis team extends streak to 5<br />\nBy GARY SWIMMER<br />\nThe Hopkins tennis team<br />\nsucceeded in defeating all three<br />\nof their opponents this week to<br />\nbring their winning streak to five<br />\nin a row and lift their season<br />\nrecord to 8 and 5.<br />\nAt the start of the week, the<br />\ntennis players pounded UMBC<br />\n8-1 on a windy day at their<br />\nopponent's courts. Tuesday they<br />\nswept through Loyola 5-4 in a<br />\nclose match that was almost a<br />\ncarbon copy of their first<br />\nconfrontation, and Wednesday,<br />\nthe Blue Jays faced Washington<br />\nCollege and blitzed the Shoremen<br />\n9-0.<br />\nAlthough they lost at first<br />\nsingles, last Monday's win at<br />\nUMBC was an example of the<br />\ndepth and, strong mid-season<br />\nform of the Hopkins team. Jeff<br />\nGould led the way at second<br />\nsingles resoundingly thrashing his<br />\nopponent 6-2, 6-4. Captain John<br />\nNewman also had an easy time,<br />\nwinning 6-1, 6-3 at third singles.<br />\nSophomore Chuck McCulloch<br />\nadded another win to his<br />\nimpressive record with his 6-3,6-3<br />\nwin. Junior Gary Swimmer was<br /><br />\nthe first to walk off the courts<br />\nafter a quick, crushing 6-0, 6-3<br />\nvictory.<br />\nDoubles wins by<br />\nNomady-Newman, who won 7-5,<br />\n6-2, Gould-Swimmer, who<br />\noutlasted their opponents in<br />\nthree sets 5-7, 6-3, 6-2, and the<br />\n\"tall man\" doubles combination<br />\nof McCulloch\u2014Little rounded<br />\nout the doubles sweep 6-2, 6-3,<br />\nled Hopkins to an 8-1 victory.<br />\nThe next day, in an<br />\nemotion-packed grudge match,<br />\nLoyola was again outplayed by<br />\nthe Blue Jay racketeers. Once<br />\nagain the score was 3-3 at the end<br />\nof the singles matches.<br />\nFirst and third doubles walked<br />\noff without offsetting the tie<br />\nscore which was now 4-4 thanks<br />\nto McColloch -Little's quick win<br />\nof 6-4, 6-2. Again, the pressure<br />\nwas on Gould-Swimmer who had<br />\nbeaten these rivals in a third set<br />\ntie-breaker in their last meeting.<br />\nThis time the victory came easier.<br />\nWith better weather and a home<br />\ncrowd, Swimmer-Gould put a lid<br />\non the match by winning 6-1,<br />\n3-6, 6-2.<br />\nWednesday, against<br /><br />\nWashington College, Hopkins<br />\ntennis was in top form. Rich<br />\nNomady emerged from what he<br />\ncalled an \"acute case of the<br />\nslump\" to win at first singles 6-4,<br />\n6-3. Later, Nomady pointed to<br />\nhis upsurge in aggression and the<br />\nfact that he was taking his shots<br />\nmuch e4er as the reasons for his<br />\nsuccess.<br />\nCoach Robert Hughes<br />\nexpressed great pleasure with the<br />\nteam's performance this past<br />\nweek. Much of the team's success<br />\ncan be attributed to the<br />\ninnovative leadership of their<br />\nnew coach. Hughes, a dean at the<br />\nSchool of Health Services, is a<br />\nfine player in his own right and<br />\nappears largely responsible for<br />\nthe newfound cohesion and<br />\ndevelopment of the team's<br />\npotential.<br /><br />\nAtm..<br /><br />\ndefeat by Russ Lindner's<br />\nexceptional score of 76 on the<br />\ndemanding course. The 76 was<br />\nthe lowest competitive round of<br />\nthe season and the team's lowest<br />\nas well. He was followed in<br />\nscoring by Joe Arminio with an<br />\n86, Frank Healey with an 88,<br />\nMike Deak with an 89 and Bob<br />\nSchiemel with a 90.<br />\nTowson<br />\nThe Hopkins golfers were<br />\nagain defeated on Monday in a<br />\nmatch against the Towson State<br />\nCollege golf team on the Tigers<br />\nhome course. The team scores<br />\nwere Towson State-412, and<br />\nJ HU 424. Russ Lindner and<br />\nFrank Healey were the low<br />\nscorers for the Blue Jays with<br /><br />\nthe fourth, but it turned out not<br />\nto be enough.<br />\nStarting pitcher Phil<br />\nBurlington was effective in his<br />\nopening five innings of work,<br />\ngetting picked on in the third for<br />\ntwo runs, one of which was<br />\nunearned. It was the sixth inning<br />\nthat proved to be fatal for the<br />\nJays. It all started with<br />\nBurlington failing to cover on a<br />\nground ball between first base<br />\nand the mound. After three runs<br />\nwere in and two men away,<br />\nPedroni picked up a dribbler near<br />\nthe third base line, a ball that<br />\nwould have rolled foul, and was<br />\nunable to make a play at first.<br />\nFollowing the error, Loyola<br />\nmanaged to load the bases and<br />\nclear them hopping on reliever<br />\nBill Jones for two singles and a<br />\ntriple. Before the sixth ended,<br />\ntwo more would score and leave<br />\nHopkins four runs down at 10-6.<br />\nThe game ended with that total<br />\non the board.<br />\nIn the nightcap, Loyola tallied<br />\nseven times in the first two<br />\ninnings, knocking starter Ed<br />\nChory out after only one and a<br />\nthird. Hopkins committed seven<br />\nerrors in the ball game causing<br />\neight of Loyola's eleven runs to<br />\nbe unearned. Thc. final score was<br />\n11-3, leaving the Jays with a 5-11<br />\nseason slate.<br /><br />\nJV laxmen smash Essex, 13-5<br />\nThe JV lacrosse team got off<br />\nto a slow start in the first quarter<br />\nof their game last Tuesday<br />\nagainst Essex Community<br /><br />\nGolfers raise MAC record to 4-3<br />\nBy JOHN ALLAN<br />\nThe Hopkins golf team<br />\nimproved its Middle Atlantic<br />\nConference record to four and<br />\nthree while dropping its overall<br />\nrecord to six and five in<br />\ncompetitive play this past week.<br />\nThe six victories by the team so<br />\nfar this season already equals the<br />\nnumber won all last season by<br />\nessentially the same team<br />\nmembers.<br />\nMiddies<br />\nOn Saturday the Blue Jay<br />\ngolfers journied to Annapolis to<br />\ntake on the always tough Middies<br />\nof the U.S. Naval Academy.

They were followed<br />\nby Bob Ivanhoe and Frank<br />\nHealey with 83's and Joe<br />\nArminio with a 91. The match<br />\nwas held at Hopkins' home<br />\ncourse, the. Worthington Valley<br />\nCountry Club.<br /><br />\nCollege. but took control in the<br />\nsecond quarter and proceeded to<br />\ncrush Essex 13-5.<br />\nThe first quarter was a fairly<br />\neven match. Essex displayed fine<br />\nstick-handling on both sides of<br />\nthe field and maintained pressure<br />\non the Hopkins goal. The Baby<br />\nJays for their part threw away<br />\nseveral scoring opportunities<br />\nalthough they were still able to<br />\nconvert twice. on goals from<br />\nDoober Aburn and Carl Yeich.<br />\n. Stickwork<br />\nHopkins' woes were not<br />\nconfined to offense alone.<br />\nDefensively, stickwork and<br />\nclearing seemed to be the Baby<br />\nJays' major problem. As he has<br />\ndone in many of the Baby Jays'<br />\ngames, Goalie Jay Trainor was<br />\nable to keep the team in the<br />\ngame pulling in eight saves and<br />\nonly allowing two goals during<br />\nthe quarter. He total 31 saves for<br />\nthe game!<br />\nThe story changed in the<br />\nsecond period. With 1:04 elapsed<br />\nin the quarter, Hopkins' PJ Boyle<br /><br />\npicked up a loose ball and<br />\nhummed in a goal to put the<br />\nBaby Jays ahead 3-2. From there<br />\non in, the game belonged to<br />\nHopkins. Tom Cirillo, Doober<br />\nAburn, and Joe Devlin popped in<br />\nthree quick goals at the end of<br />\nthe quarter to give the Baby Jays<br />\na 6-2 edge at the half.<br />\nThe third quarter began with<br />\nEssex scoring first on a goal by J.<br />\nWebbert, as the E\u2014men tried to<br />\nreverse the tide of the game.<br />\nTheir hopes were dashed quickly,<br />\nhowever, as Joe Devlin scored a<br />\nminute later on a feed from Carl<br />\nYeich. The Baby Jays scored<br />\nthree more times in the third<br />\nquarter, on 'two goals by Tom<br />\nCirillo and another by Devlin.<br />\nIn the fourth quarter, the<br />\nBaby Jays ended their scoring<br />\nspree with two goals by PJ Boyle<br />\nand one by Doober Aburn.<br />\nThe Baby Jays play Anne<br />\nArundel Community College<br />\ntoday'at 3 on the varsity practice<br />\nfield to kick-off the Spring Fair<br />\nWeekend.<br /><br />\npage 12/news-letter/april 24, 1975<br /><br />\nPeople's Free Medical Clinic celebrates its fifth b-day<br />\nBy RUSS SMITH<br />\nThe People's Free Medical<br />\nClinic, located at 3028<br />\nGreenmount Avenue, will<br />\ncelebrate it's fifth anniversary<br />\nduring the week of April 28-May<br />\n4. Some of the events the Clinic<br />\nwill sponsor are as follows:<br />\nOpen house at the clinic<br />\nweek-noon to 5 pm.<br />\niy,<br />\nSquare Dance April<br />\nJHU, Great Hall<br />\nCaller\u2014Bob Dalsemer.<br />\nDonation $2.00<br />\nAuction\u2014May 2,7:30 pm<br />\nSt. John's Church<br />\n27th and St. Paul<br />\nStreet Festival\u2014 May 3<br />\n11:00 am-5:30 pm<br />\nVineyard and 30th<br />\nLive music and crafts<br />\nThe Clinic operates under the<br />\nprinciple that \"health care is a<br />\nright, not a privilege,\" and serves<br />\napproximately 7 500<br />\nWaverly-Charles Village residents<br />\neacy year. Composed of more<br />\nthan 100 professiona.1 and<br />\nnon-professional volunteers, the<br />\nClinic staff offers \"general<br />\nmedical care, gynecological<br />\nservices, pediatrics, dental<br />\nservices, early pregnancy<br />\ndetection, and abortion<br />\ncounseling and referral.\"<br />\nSince its inception, the Clinic<br />\nhas slowly expanded its services<br />\nand now occupies three adjoining<br />\nrowhouses. Presently, the Clinic<br />\nis divided into two sections, one<br />\nfor medical service, the other for<br />\ncounseling.<br /><br />\nEach time a patient comes to<br />\nthe Clinic he is attended to by<br />\nthe same \"advocate\" as the staff<br />\nstrongly believes that \"continuity<br />\nof care\" is essential. The<br />\nadvocate is responsible for the<br />\ngeneral supervision of his patients<br />\nand it is he who \"ties everything<br />\ntogether.\"<br />\nThe Clinic, which is open four<br />\nnights a week (Monday through<br />\nThursday, 6:30-10:30). has a<br />\ndifferent staff for each night.<br />\nThere is always one doctor in<br />\nattendence. along with nurses,<br />\ncounselors, advocates, lab<br />\ntechnicians, and \"behind the<br /><br />\nThe People's Free Medical Clinic<br />\nscenes\" workers. Because of thie<br />\narrangement, each staff forms an<br />\nidentity and works closely with<br />\neach other. A unique facet of the<br />\nClinic's spirit is the integration of<br />\njobs and reponsibilities. For<br />\nexample, if a nurse is not<br />\navailable, a qualified member<br />\nwith a different function of the<br />\nstaff will substitute.<br />\nThe counseling division of the<br />\nClinic has two primary functions:<br />\ngeneral counseling for emotional<br />\nand physical needs and -women's<br />\ncounseling. People coming to the<br />\nclinic for counseling are dealt<br />\nwith on a one to one basis and all<br /><br />\ninformation taken by counselors<br />\nis kept confidential.<br />\nThe counselors also give<br />\npregnancy tests and offer<br />\ninformation about abortion and<br />\nvenereal disease. The counseling<br />\nsection is not limited to residents<br />\nof the Waverly\u2014Charles Village<br />\narea,(unlike the medical service)<br />\nand will assist anyone in need.<br />\nBecause the Clinic operates<br />\nunder the premise that health<br />\ncare should not be dependent on<br />\na patient's ability to pay, funds<br />\nmust be obtained from sources<br />\nother than patient fees. Much of<br />\nthe Clinic's annual $30,000<br /><br />\nbudget is gotten from donations<br />\nand monthly pledges provided by<br />\npatients and members of the<br />\ncommunity.<br />\nApparently, however, the<br />\nClinic's ties with Hopkins are not<br />\nas productive as they could be.,'<br />\nMany Hopkins students volunteer<br />\nto work at the Clinic, but they<br />\nusually don't commit themselves<br />\nfor a long duration, according to<br />\none worker there. The Clinic is<br />\nhesitant to treat Hopkins<br />\nstudents who seek medical<br />\nattention. The Clinic's staff<br />\nbelieves that students at Hopkins<br />\nshould rely on the Brown<br />\nInfirmary for care, so as not to<br />\ndeprive the community residents<br />\nwho have nowhere else to go. In<br />\nsituations where a_ student does<br />\nnot receive adequate attention at<br />\nBrown Infirmary, the Clinic will<br />\naccept students as patients. For<br />\nexample, Brown Infirmary will<br />\nnot treat cases of venereal<br />\ndisease, say the Clinic workers.<br />\nThe People's Free Medical<br />\nClinic is probably the most<br />\nsignificant exhibition of<br />\ncommunity interaction in the<br />\nWaverly\u2014Charles Village<br />\nneighborhood. Although growing<br />\nconstantly, the Clinic needs more<br />\ndoctors and contributions.<br />\nPeople interested in seeing how<br />\nthe Clinic works are encouraged<br />\nto drop by weekday nights. And<br />\neveryone is invited to participate<br />\nin the upcoming week of<br />\nfestivities which will begin next<br />\nweek.<br /><br />\n\u2022<br /><br />\nTHE<br />\nJOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY<br />\nSUMMER SESSION 1975<br /><br />\n*&amp;Ant Cala!
