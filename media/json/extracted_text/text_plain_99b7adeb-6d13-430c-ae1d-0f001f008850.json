It has been suggested to the class that they erect a sunOil V lif'd<br />\ndial in the Botanical Gardens which are building at Homewood.<br />\nThis would be a very beautiful gift, and could be prettily arranged in the gardens. It<br />\nwould be partly surrounded by a semi-circular hedge, where later could be placed a marble<br />\nbench of the same shape.<br />\nAnother plan that has been proposed is to give a panel of the fence which is to be built<br />\naround the athletic field. This needs more explanation. The University has plans for this<br />\nfence, which shall be of the following style: It shall have a solid base, about three feet high,<br />\nand a column every twenty feet. This part is to be of brick with marble trimmings. Between<br />\nthe columns is to be an iron picket-fence. This style of fence will make the grounds more<br />\nopen, and will be much prettier than a solid wall. To prevent outsiders from seeing the<br />\ngames, there will be a tall hedge inside the fence. Now it has been suggested that the Senior<br />\nClass build a section of this fence, from column to column, and build in the fence a tablet<br />\ncontaining the class numerals. The exact cost has not been estimated, but it is said that it<br />\nwould not exceed one hundred and fifty dollars. Surely the class can afford that amount.<br />\nWe might suggest that instead of the Senior Class making this present it should be done in the<br />\nJunior year, when the class-expenses are not so heavy as at the time of graduation.<br />\nIf some class should start this custom it would be followed by all the classes yet to<br />\ncome, and the scheme would probably be aided by some of the classes that have gone before.<br />\nAt this rate it would not be long before we had a handsome fence around our athletic field,<br />\nand, therefore, this matter should be taken up immediately by either the present Senior or<br />\nJunior Class.<br />\n'.<br />\n<br />\niittrftrig<br />\n<br />\n\u2022<br />\n<br />\n\fTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\n<br />\nTHREE PROMINENT SENIORS.<br />\n<br />\nJ.

Inside, ten or a dozen men stood<br />\ntalking loudly at the bar. One of these,<br />\nwhom his companions called Bill, especially<br />\nattracted Harry's attention.<br />\n.He was an enormous fellow with high<br />\nleather boots, tight buckskin breeches and a<br />\nblue flannel shrit, around the neck of which<br />\na red bandana was loosely knotted. His face,<br />\nhalf-hidden under a broad sombrero, was particularly malevolent. His small, pig-like eyes<br />\nwere set close together, and a long, deep scar<br />\nstarted at his ear and lost itself in his heavy,<br />\nblack moustache. His make-up was anything<br />\nbut pleasing.<br />\nAs Harry entered, the ruffian was saying to<br />\nthe bartender: \"Set 'em up, Curly, they're<br />\non me tonight.''<br />\nThen as he caught sight of Harry, \"Come<br />\nover, stranger, an' have a drink.\"<br />\nDespite his protest, Harry was obliged to<br />\ntake some of the fiery liquid that served for<br />\nwhiskey in Campbell; then he beat a hasty<br />\nretreat to the porch.<br />\nHarry went to bed soon after supper that<br />\nnight and slept like a log, for he was tired out<br />\nby his trip.<br />\n<br />\nThe next day was Sunday, consequently<br />\nthe mine would be deserted, and Harry felt<br />\nsafe in making an inspection of it. Therefore he was up before sun-rise and, having<br />\nhired a horse the night before, he began his<br />\nfifteen-mile ride to the mine.<br />\nHe had gone some distance before the sun,<br />\nlike a red ball of fire, began to peep over the<br />\nsun, like a red ball of fire, began to peep<br />\nover the Cerbat Mountains, bathing the world<br />\nin glorious sun-light. The scene before him<br />\nwas magnificent. Five miles away to his<br />\nright, the mountains rose majestically, their<br />\nrugged sides hardly discernable against the<br />\nbright sun behind them. On his left, the<br />\nbroad, flat prairie stretched away for miles,<br />\nuntil it seemed to merge with the hazy morning sky. The muffled beats of the pony's<br />\nhoofs were the only sound to break the peaceful stillness.<br />\nJust as the livery-man had said, the trail<br />\n<br />\n5<br />\n<br />\nended about two miles from the mine, but the<br />\nbuildings Were plainly visible from the end<br />\nof the trail. Several frame shanties, clustered<br />\nclosely together, showed its location, and as<br />\nHarry approached, he saw that the place was<br />\ndeserted.<br />\nAs he dismounted from his pony and prepared to descend the shaft, his heart beat<br />\nfuriously.<br />\n\"Suppose McGregor is honest; what if the<br />\nmine is worthless,\" he thought, as he peered<br />\ndown the black mouth of the shaft. \"I<br />\nwould be practically penniless; not even a<br />\nprofession to fall back upon.\"<br />\nWith these thoughts racing through his<br />\nbrain, Harry almost feared to find out the<br />\ntruth; but with an effort he pulled himself together and began the descent.<br />\nSoon he reach a cross-cut, and as he held<br />\nhis lantern close to the wall, he shouted<br />\naloud.<br />\n\"GOLD! GOLD! Oh it's true, it's true?\"<br />\nThen as his inspection progressed, he found<br />\na new vein, lately uncovered, even richer than<br />\nthe first.<br />\n\"Poor Dad.\" he muttered, \"he was easy<br />\nindeed. There's enough here to make three<br />\npeople wealthy. I reckon Mr. McGregor's<br />\ndays around the Three Star Mine are numbered.\"<br />\nWith a light heart Harry ascnded the<br />\nshaft, and, mounting his pony, rode slowly<br />\nback to Campbell.<br />\nWhen he entered the hotel, he asked the<br />\nbartender where he could find Mr. William<br />\nMcGregor, of the Three Star Mine.<br />\n\"There he sits on the porch, sir.\"<br />\n.his name's Bill.\"<br />\n\"What! Why they<br />\n\"Sure, Bill McGregor, don't you see?\"<br />\n\"Thanks\" said Harry, and walked out to<br />\nwhere Bill sat basking in the sun.<br />\n\"Is this Mr. McGregor?\" he said, addressing Bill.<br />\n\"That's my name, stranger.\"<br />\n\"Well, I have something of importance to<br />\ntell you; would you mind coming to my<br />\nroom?\"<br />\nBill rose lazily and followed Harry inside.<br />\nWhen the door of the room was safely closed,<br />\nHarry said:<br />\n\"Don't you think you are playing a rather<br />\nrisky game, McGregor?\"<br />\n<br />\n\f6<br />\n<br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\n<br />\n\"Huh! Don't talk in riddles, sonny.

Well, I am that son.\"<br />\n\"Mr. Bronson, I am very glad to know you,<br />\nand I deeply sympathize with you in your<br />\nrecent trouble.\"<br />\n\"My recent trouble?

The committee on Senior<br />\nweek, which is composed of Mr. Kelly,<br />\nMr. Frank, Mr. Ridgely, and Mr. Bridgman,<br />\nhave made very extensive plans for the occasion. Dates are being made for the entire time.<br />\nSince most, if not all, of the Seniors, will<br />\nfinish their examinations by Thursday at noon,<br />\nthe committee are making arrangements for a<br />\ntrip down the bay that afternoon. They will<br />\nleave about three o'clock, arriving at their<br />\ndestination in time for dinner. There they<br />\nwill spend the night, and will have a rousing<br />\ngood time, for this class has demonstrated on<br />\nmany occasions that it is capable of doing so.<br />\nre.<br />\nOf course, they will not get back until some<br />\ntime Friday afternoon, consequently nothing<br />\nhas been planned for that time. Friday night,<br />\nDean Griffin will entertain the class at a<br />\nreception at the Johns Hopkins Club. This<br />\nfunction will be most enjoyable to the class.<br />\nAs yet, Saturday morning is open, but<br />\nprobably by the time this is in print, the<br />\ncommittee will have decided upon something<br />\nto do. Arrangements have been made for a<br />\nlacrosse game between the Hopkins Alumni<br />\nand the Philadelphia Lacrosse Team for Saturday afternoon. That night an interesting<br />\naffair will take place. The Athletic Association will entertain the class at Homewood.<br />\nWe have not been able to learn the exact<br />\nIliaPjeno*<br />\nnature of this affair, but it has been reported<br />\nthat among other things the \"H's\" will be<br />\nManager Mose\u2014\"Huccome it, Cap'n Johnawarded, and refreshments will be served.<br />\nson,<br />\ndat yo' team am lettin' dose udder fellers<br />\nThe next day being Sunday, there will be<br />\nbases so easy lak?\"<br />\nsteal<br />\nnothing except the Baccalaureate Sermon at<br />\nCaptain Johnson (Of the Charcoal Diamond<br />\neleven o'clock.<br />\nNine)\u2014\"Mistah Mose, while not bein' perMonday morning is also open, as it is<br />\nsolicitous ob prosecutin' any 'sinuations<br />\ntickler<br />\nextremely hard to find any amusement for the<br />\nyo' cayrackter, I might enlight'n yo<br />\nagainst<br />\nmorning.

They won the local championship by defeating Mount Washingeon, 7 to 4,<br />\nand they only lost the American collegiate<br />\nchampionship to the University of Toronto in<br />\na game that the Canucks had to sweat blood<br />\nto win, 9 to 6.<br />\nIn addition to these honors our team has<br />\nhad the great honor of having been invited to<br />\nattend the Olympian games in England, and<br />\ncontest with the champion college teams of<br />\nEngland, Canada and Australia for the world's<br />\nlacrosse championship.<br />\nThe game with Mount Washington brought<br />\nout what was probably the best play of the<br />\nseason. The game started at a lightning pace,<br />\nand in the first few minutes' play Mount<br />\nWashington scored the first tally. Both sides<br />\nfought hard for fifteen minutes before the<br />\nMountaineers tallied again. After this goal,<br />\nhowever, the Black and Blue attack steadied<br />\ndown, and after a pretty bit of team work,<br />\nClary slipped the ball past Briscoe, the Mount<br />\nWashington goal tend.<br />\n<br />\n\u2022<br />\n<br />\nIn the second half our fellows, with the<br />\nmemory of the Swarthmore game lodged<br />\nfirmly in their minds, started out to do things.<br />\nThe Mountaineers just could not resist the<br />\nhurricane style of play of the Black and Blue<br />\nmid-field and attack, and when the smoke<br />\ncleared at the end of the half the score stood<br />\n7 to 4 in our favor.<br />\nThe entire team played as a unit in this<br />\ngame, and every man deserves full credit.<br />\nClary showed himself especially clever in<br />\nshooting goals, and should be a valuable man<br />\nnext year. Much credit is also due to that<br />\nmid-field quartet\u2014Chesney, Lowndes, Breyer<br />\nand Cline\u2014for they maintained a fast pace<br />\nfrom start to finish and easily winded their<br />\nopponents.<br />\nThe Toronto game was undoubtedly the<br />\nhardest fought of the season. Although our<br />\nteam was defeated, it died fighting hard, and<br />\nour fellows deserve all the honor imaginable<br />\nfor the game struggle they put up. It is safe<br />\nto say that Toronto is the only College team<br />\nin America that could have downed the team<br />\nthat Hopkins put on the field.<br />\nThe work of the Hopkins defense was excellent, Walter Blanck, Frank Williams, Meyer<br />\nand Captain Harry Schmeisser playing as<br />\nthey never played before. On the attack,<br />\nChesney, Clary, Lowndes, Frank and Breyer<br />\nplayed with all the energy that was in them,<br />\nand had it not been for the excellent work of<br />\nCaptain Areans at goal for Toronto the victory<br />\nwould have been ours.<br />\n<br />\n\f9<br />\n<br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\n<br />\nOur line-up in the last three games:<br />\nGoal\u2014Walter Blanck.<br />\nPoint\u2014Captain Harry Schmeisser.<br />\nCover-point\u2014Frank Williams.<br />\nFirst defense\u2014Charles Meyer.<br />\nSecond defense\u2014Ralph Williams.<br />\nThird defense\u2014Alan Chesney.<br />\nCenter\u2014Bob Lowndes and Leo Gutman.<br />\nThird attack\u2014Frank Breyer.<br />\nSecond attack\u2014Cline, Paul Wegefarth and<br />\nCharles Mathias.<br />\nFirst attack\u2014Henry Frank.<br />\nOuthome\u2014Edmund Clary and Frank Whitcraft.<br />\nInhome\u2014Gordon Armstrong.<br />\nThe scores of the season's games:<br />\nApril 4\u2014Hopkins, 8;<br />\nApril 11\u2014Hopkins, 11;<br />\nApril 18 \u2014Hopkins, 6,<br />\nApril 25\u2014Hopkins, 6;<br />\nMay 2\u2014Hopkins, 5;<br />\nMay 9\u2014Hopkins, 4;<br />\nMay 16\u2014Hopkins, 7;<br />\nMay 23\u2014Hopkins, 6;<br />\n<br />\nAlumni, 2.<br />\nColumbia, 0.<br />\nHarvard, 3.<br />\nLehigh, 2.<br />\nStevens, 0.<br />\nSwarthmore, 3.<br />\nMt.

This is amply shown<br />\nin the fact that in this meet their athletes<br />\nequalled one world's record and smashed three<br />\nSouth Atlantic records. Rector equalled the<br />\nworld's record in the 100-yard dash by making the distance in 9 3-5 seconds. The same<br />\nsprinter ran the 220 in 21 4-5, a new South<br />\nAtlantic record. New marks were also made<br />\nin the 120 and 220-yard hurdles.<br />\nCaptain Brenton ran a fine race in the<br />\nmile, making the distance in 4: 37 3-5.

In<br />\nthe first half, Swarthmore scored three points<br />\nand made numerous attempts at goal, while<br />\nStevens at no time seriously threatened the<br />\nQuakers' goal. Stevens played fast at the<br />\nbeginning of the second half and registered<br />\nher two points, but could not keep up the<br />\npace.

It has been suggested to the class that they erect a sunOil V lif'd<br />\ndial in the Botanical Gardens which are building at Homewood.<br />\nThis would be a very beautiful gift, and could be prettily arranged in the gardens. It<br />\nwould be partly surrounded by a semi-circular hedge, where later could be placed a marble<br />\nbench of the same shape.<br />\nAnother plan that has been proposed is to give a panel of the fence which is to be built<br />\naround the athletic field. This needs more explanation. The University has plans for this<br />\nfence, which shall be of the following style: It shall have a solid base, about three feet high,<br />\nand a column every twenty feet. This part is to be of brick with marble trimmings. Between<br />\nthe columns is to be an iron picket-fence. This style of fence will make the grounds more<br />\nopen, and will be much prettier than a solid wall. To prevent outsiders from seeing the<br />\ngames, there will be a tall hedge inside the fence. Now it has been suggested that the Senior<br />\nClass build a section of this fence, from column to column, and build in the fence a tablet<br />\ncontaining the class numerals. The exact cost has not been estimated, but it is said that it<br />\nwould not exceed one hundred and fifty dollars. Surely the class can afford that amount.<br />\nWe might suggest that instead of the Senior Class making this present it should be done in the<br />\nJunior year, when the class-expenses are not so heavy as at the time of graduation.<br />\nIf some class should start this custom it would be followed by all the classes yet to<br />\ncome, and the scheme would probably be aided by some of the classes that have gone before.<br />\nAt this rate it would not be long before we had a handsome fence around our athletic field,<br />\nand, therefore, this matter should be taken up immediately by either the present Senior or<br />\nJunior Class.<br />\n'.<br /><br />\niittrftrig<br /><br />\n\u2022<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br /><br />\nTHREE PROMINENT SENIORS.<br /><br />\nJ.

Inside, ten or a dozen men stood<br />\ntalking loudly at the bar. One of these,<br />\nwhom his companions called Bill, especially<br />\nattracted Harry's attention.<br />\n.He was an enormous fellow with high<br />\nleather boots, tight buckskin breeches and a<br />\nblue flannel shrit, around the neck of which<br />\na red bandana was loosely knotted. His face,<br />\nhalf-hidden under a broad sombrero, was particularly malevolent. His small, pig-like eyes<br />\nwere set close together, and a long, deep scar<br />\nstarted at his ear and lost itself in his heavy,<br />\nblack moustache. His make-up was anything<br />\nbut pleasing.<br />\nAs Harry entered, the ruffian was saying to<br />\nthe bartender: \"Set 'em up, Curly, they're<br />\non me tonight.''<br />\nThen as he caught sight of Harry, \"Come<br />\nover, stranger, an' have a drink.\"<br />\nDespite his protest, Harry was obliged to<br />\ntake some of the fiery liquid that served for<br />\nwhiskey in Campbell; then he beat a hasty<br />\nretreat to the porch.<br />\nHarry went to bed soon after supper that<br />\nnight and slept like a log, for he was tired out<br />\nby his trip.<br /><br />\nThe next day was Sunday, consequently<br />\nthe mine would be deserted, and Harry felt<br />\nsafe in making an inspection of it. Therefore he was up before sun-rise and, having<br />\nhired a horse the night before, he began his<br />\nfifteen-mile ride to the mine.<br />\nHe had gone some distance before the sun,<br />\nlike a red ball of fire, began to peep over the<br />\nsun, like a red ball of fire, began to peep<br />\nover the Cerbat Mountains, bathing the world<br />\nin glorious sun-light. The scene before him<br />\nwas magnificent. Five miles away to his<br />\nright, the mountains rose majestically, their<br />\nrugged sides hardly discernable against the<br />\nbright sun behind them. On his left, the<br />\nbroad, flat prairie stretched away for miles,<br />\nuntil it seemed to merge with the hazy morning sky. The muffled beats of the pony's<br />\nhoofs were the only sound to break the peaceful stillness.<br />\nJust as the livery-man had said, the trail<br /><br />\n5<br /><br />\nended about two miles from the mine, but the<br />\nbuildings Were plainly visible from the end<br />\nof the trail. Several frame shanties, clustered<br />\nclosely together, showed its location, and as<br />\nHarry approached, he saw that the place was<br />\ndeserted.<br />\nAs he dismounted from his pony and prepared to descend the shaft, his heart beat<br />\nfuriously.<br />\n\"Suppose McGregor is honest; what if the<br />\nmine is worthless,\" he thought, as he peered<br />\ndown the black mouth of the shaft. \"I<br />\nwould be practically penniless; not even a<br />\nprofession to fall back upon.\"<br />\nWith these thoughts racing through his<br />\nbrain, Harry almost feared to find out the<br />\ntruth; but with an effort he pulled himself together and began the descent.<br />\nSoon he reach a cross-cut, and as he held<br />\nhis lantern close to the wall, he shouted<br />\naloud.<br />\n\"GOLD! GOLD! Oh it's true, it's true?\"<br />\nThen as his inspection progressed, he found<br />\na new vein, lately uncovered, even richer than<br />\nthe first.<br />\n\"Poor Dad.\" he muttered, \"he was easy<br />\nindeed. There's enough here to make three<br />\npeople wealthy. I reckon Mr. McGregor's<br />\ndays around the Three Star Mine are numbered.\"<br />\nWith a light heart Harry ascnded the<br />\nshaft, and, mounting his pony, rode slowly<br />\nback to Campbell.<br />\nWhen he entered the hotel, he asked the<br />\nbartender where he could find Mr. William<br />\nMcGregor, of the Three Star Mine.<br />\n\"There he sits on the porch, sir.\"<br />\n.his name's Bill.\"<br />\n\"What! Why they<br />\n\"Sure, Bill McGregor, don't you see?\"<br />\n\"Thanks\" said Harry, and walked out to<br />\nwhere Bill sat basking in the sun.<br />\n\"Is this Mr. McGregor?\" he said, addressing Bill.<br />\n\"That's my name, stranger.\"<br />\n\"Well, I have something of importance to<br />\ntell you; would you mind coming to my<br />\nroom?\"<br />\nBill rose lazily and followed Harry inside.<br />\nWhen the door of the room was safely closed,<br />\nHarry said:<br />\n\"Don't you think you are playing a rather<br />\nrisky game, McGregor?\"<br /><br />\n6<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br /><br />\n\"Huh! Don't talk in riddles, sonny. What<br />\ndo you mean?\"<br />\n\"I mean, McGregor, that your services are<br />\nno longer needed around the Three Star<br />\nMine.\"<br />\n\"Thanks for the information, sonny, but<br />\nwould you mind telling me who you are?\" and<br />\nMcGregor smiled pleasantly.<br />\n\"Did it ever occur to you that, although<br />\ntoo ill to come himself, James Bronson might<br />\nhave a son? Well, I am that son.\"<br />\n\"Mr. Bronson, I am very glad to know you,<br />\nand I deeply sympathize with you in your<br />\nrecent trouble.\"<br />\n\"My recent trouble?

This<br />\nfunction will be most enjoyable to the class.<br />\nAs yet, Saturday morning is open, but<br />\nprobably by the time this is in print, the<br />\ncommittee will have decided upon something<br />\nto do. Arrangements have been made for a<br />\nlacrosse game between the Hopkins Alumni<br />\nand the Philadelphia Lacrosse Team for Saturday afternoon. That night an interesting<br />\naffair will take place.

They won the local championship by defeating Mount Washingeon, 7 to 4,<br />\nand they only lost the American collegiate<br />\nchampionship to the University of Toronto in<br />\na game that the Canucks had to sweat blood<br />\nto win, 9 to 6.<br />\nIn addition to these honors our team has<br />\nhad the great honor of having been invited to<br />\nattend the Olympian games in England, and<br />\ncontest with the champion college teams of<br />\nEngland, Canada and Australia for the world's<br />\nlacrosse championship.<br />\nThe game with Mount Washington brought<br />\nout what was probably the best play of the<br />\nseason. The game started at a lightning pace,<br />\nand in the first few minutes' play Mount<br />\nWashington scored the first tally. Both sides<br />\nfought hard for fifteen minutes before the<br />\nMountaineers tallied again. After this goal,<br />\nhowever, the Black and Blue attack steadied<br />\ndown, and after a pretty bit of team work,<br />\nClary slipped the ball past Briscoe, the Mount<br />\nWashington goal tend.<br /><br />\n\u2022<br /><br />\nIn the second half our fellows, with the<br />\nmemory of the Swarthmore game lodged<br />\nfirmly in their minds, started out to do things.<br />\nThe Mountaineers just could not resist the<br />\nhurricane style of play of the Black and Blue<br />\nmid-field and attack, and when the smoke<br />\ncleared at the end of the half the score stood<br />\n7 to 4 in our favor.<br />\nThe entire team played as a unit in this<br />\ngame, and every man deserves full credit.<br />\nClary showed himself especially clever in<br />\nshooting goals, and should be a valuable man<br />\nnext year. Much credit is also due to that<br />\nmid-field quartet\u2014Chesney, Lowndes, Breyer<br />\nand Cline\u2014for they maintained a fast pace<br />\nfrom start to finish and easily winded their<br />\nopponents.<br />\nThe Toronto game was undoubtedly the<br />\nhardest fought of the season. Although our<br />\nteam was defeated, it died fighting hard, and<br />\nour fellows deserve all the honor imaginable<br />\nfor the game struggle they put up. It is safe<br />\nto say that Toronto is the only College team<br />\nin America that could have downed the team<br />\nthat Hopkins put on the field.<br />\nThe work of the Hopkins defense was excellent, Walter Blanck, Frank Williams, Meyer<br />\nand Captain Harry Schmeisser playing as<br />\nthey never played before. On the attack,<br />\nChesney, Clary, Lowndes, Frank and Breyer<br />\nplayed with all the energy that was in them,<br />\nand had it not been for the excellent work of<br />\nCaptain Areans at goal for Toronto the victory<br />\nwould have been ours.<br /><br />\n9<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br /><br />\nOur line-up in the last three games:<br />\nGoal\u2014Walter Blanck.<br />\nPoint\u2014Captain Harry Schmeisser.<br />\nCover-point\u2014Frank Williams.<br />\nFirst defense\u2014Charles Meyer.<br />\nSecond defense\u2014Ralph Williams.<br />\nThird defense\u2014Alan Chesney.<br />\nCenter\u2014Bob Lowndes and Leo Gutman.<br />\nThird attack\u2014Frank Breyer.<br />\nSecond attack\u2014Cline, Paul Wegefarth and<br />\nCharles Mathias.<br />\nFirst attack\u2014Henry Frank.<br />\nOuthome\u2014Edmund Clary and Frank Whitcraft.<br />\nInhome\u2014Gordon Armstrong.<br />\nThe scores of the season's games:<br />\nApril 4\u2014Hopkins, 8;<br />\nApril 11\u2014Hopkins, 11;<br />\nApril 18 \u2014Hopkins, 6,<br />\nApril 25\u2014Hopkins, 6;<br />\nMay 2\u2014Hopkins, 5;<br />\nMay 9\u2014Hopkins, 4;<br />\nMay 16\u2014Hopkins, 7;<br />\nMay 23\u2014Hopkins, 6;<br /><br />\nAlumni, 2.<br />\nColumbia, 0.<br />\nHarvard, 3.<br />\nLehigh, 2.<br />\nStevens, 0.<br />\nSwarthmore, 3.<br />\nMt.

This is amply shown<br />\nin the fact that in this meet their athletes<br />\nequalled one world's record and smashed three<br />\nSouth Atlantic records.
