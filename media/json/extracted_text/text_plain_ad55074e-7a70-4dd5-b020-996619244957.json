Today, a full 13 years later, I am still writing<br />\nthis column,for my interest in undergraduates is as keen<br />\nand lively as ever. This is called \"arrested development:'<br />\nBut where else can a writer find a subject as fascinating<br />\nas the American campus? Where else are minds so nettled,<br />\nbodies so roiled, psyches so unglued?<br />\nRight now,for example,though the new school year has<br />\njust begun, you've already encountered the following disasters:<br />\n1. You hate your teachers,<br />\n2. You hate your courses.<br />\n3. You hate your room-mates.<br />\n4. You have no time to study.<br />\n5. You have no place to study.<br />\nFriends,let us, without despair, examine your problems<br />\none by one.<br />\n1. You hate your teachers. For shame, friends! Try<br />\nlooking at things their way. Take your English teacher,<br />\nfor instance. Here's a man who is one of the world's<br />\nauthorities on Robert Browning, yet he wears $30 tweeds<br />\nand a pre-war necktie while his brother Sam,a high school<br />\ndropout, earns 70 thou a year in aluminum siding. Is it so<br />\nhard to understand why he writes \"F\" on top of your<br />\nthemes and \"Eeeyich!\" in the margin? Instead of hating<br />\nhim, should you not admire his dedication to scholarship,<br />\nhis disdain for the blandishments of commerce? Of course<br />\nyou should. You may flunk, but Pippa passes.<br />\n2. You hate your courses. You say, for example, that<br />\nyou don't see the use of studying Macbeth when you are<br />\nmajoring in veterinary medicine. You're wrong, friends.<br />\nBelieve me,some day when you are running a busy kennel,<br />\nyou'll be mighty glad you learned \"Out, damned Spot!\"<br />\n3. You hate your room-mates. This is, unquestionably,<br />\na big problem\u2014in fact, the second biggest problem on<br />\nAmerican campuses. (The first biggest, of course, is on<br />\nwhich side of your mortar board do you dangle the tassel<br />\nat Commencement?) But there is an answer to the roommate probleM: keep changing room-mates. The optimum<br />\ninterval, I have found, is every four hours.<br />\n4. You have no time to study. Friends, I'm glad to report there is a simple way to find extra time in your busy<br />\nschedule. All you have to do is buy some Personna Super<br />\nStainless Steel Blades. Then you won't be wasting precious hours hacking away with inferior blades, mangling<br />\nyour face again and again in a tedious, feckless effort to<br />\nwinnow your whiskers. Personna shaves you quickly and<br />\nslickly, easily and breezily, hacklessly, scrapelessly, tuglessly, nicklessly, scratchlessly, matchlessly. Furthermore,<br />\nPersonna Blades last and last. Moreover, they are available both in double-edge and Injector style. And, as if this<br />\nweren't enough, Personna is now offering you a chance to<br />\ngrab a fistful of $100 bills. The Personna Super Stainless<br />\nSteel Sweepstakes is off and running! You can win $10,000<br />\nand even more. Get over to your Personna dealer for details and an entry blank. Don't just stand there!<br />\n5. You have no place to study. This is a thorny one, I'll<br />\nadmit, what with the library so jammed and the dorms so<br />\nnoisy. But with a little ingenuity, you can still find a quiet,<br />\ndeserted spot\u2014like the ticket office of the lacrosse team.<br />\nOr a testimonial dinner for the dean. Or the nearest recruiting station.<br />\n<br />\n32ND & OLD YORK ROAD<br />\n<br />\n\u2022 STEAK \u2022 FRIED CHICKE1<br />\n\u2022 SEAFOOD<br />\nWITH<br />\nSALAD,<br />\nFR.

Today, a full 13 years later, I am still writing<br />\nthis column,for my interest in undergraduates is as keen<br />\nand lively as ever. This is called \"arrested development:'<br />\nBut where else can a writer find a subject as fascinating<br />\nas the American campus? Where else are minds so nettled,<br />\nbodies so roiled, psyches so unglued?<br />\nRight now,for example,though the new school year has<br />\njust begun, you've already encountered the following disasters:<br />\n1. You hate your teachers,<br />\n2. You hate your courses.<br />\n3. You hate your room-mates.<br />\n4. You have no time to study.<br />\n5. You have no place to study.<br />\nFriends,let us, without despair, examine your problems<br />\none by one.<br />\n1. You hate your teachers. For shame, friends! Try<br />\nlooking at things their way. Take your English teacher,<br />\nfor instance. Here's a man who is one of the world's<br />\nauthorities on Robert Browning, yet he wears $30 tweeds<br />\nand a pre-war necktie while his brother Sam,a high school<br />\ndropout, earns 70 thou a year in aluminum siding. Is it so<br />\nhard to understand why he writes \"F\" on top of your<br />\nthemes and \"Eeeyich!\" in the margin? Instead of hating<br />\nhim, should you not admire his dedication to scholarship,<br />\nhis disdain for the blandishments of commerce? Of course<br />\nyou should. You may flunk, but Pippa passes.<br />\n2. You hate your courses. You say, for example, that<br />\nyou don't see the use of studying Macbeth when you are<br />\nmajoring in veterinary medicine. You're wrong, friends.<br />\nBelieve me,some day when you are running a busy kennel,<br />\nyou'll be mighty glad you learned \"Out, damned Spot!\"<br />\n3. You hate your room-mates. This is, unquestionably,<br />\na big problem\u2014in fact, the second biggest problem on<br />\nAmerican campuses. (The first biggest, of course, is on<br />\nwhich side of your mortar board do you dangle the tassel<br />\nat Commencement?) But there is an answer to the roommate probleM: keep changing room-mates. The optimum<br />\ninterval, I have found, is every four hours.<br />\n4. You have no time to study. Friends, I'm glad to report there is a simple way to find extra time in your busy<br />\nschedule. All you have to do is buy some Personna Super<br />\nStainless Steel Blades. Then you won't be wasting precious hours hacking away with inferior blades, mangling<br />\nyour face again and again in a tedious, feckless effort to<br />\nwinnow your whiskers. Personna shaves you quickly and<br />\nslickly, easily and breezily, hacklessly, scrapelessly, tuglessly, nicklessly, scratchlessly, matchlessly. Furthermore,<br />\nPersonna Blades last and last. Moreover, they are available both in double-edge and Injector style. And, as if this<br />\nweren't enough, Personna is now offering you a chance to<br />\ngrab a fistful of $100 bills. The Personna Super Stainless<br />\nSteel Sweepstakes is off and running! You can win $10,000<br />\nand even more. Get over to your Personna dealer for details and an entry blank. Don't just stand there!<br />\n5. You have no place to study. This is a thorny one, I'll<br />\nadmit, what with the library so jammed and the dorms so<br />\nnoisy. But with a little ingenuity, you can still find a quiet,<br />\ndeserted spot\u2014like the ticket office of the lacrosse team.<br />\nOr a testimonial dinner for the dean. Or the nearest recruiting station.<br /><br />\n32ND &amp; OLD YORK ROAD<br /><br />\n\u2022 STEAK \u2022 FRIED CHICKE1<br />\n\u2022 SEAFOOD<br />\nWITH<br />\nSALAD,<br />\nFR.
