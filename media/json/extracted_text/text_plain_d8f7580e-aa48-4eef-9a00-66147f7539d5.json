Powell, instructor of English, who has lately been<br />\nengaged in the study of university<br />\nlife in merry England, has discovered a hitherto unpublished manuscript of Sir Walter Scott, written in his student days at Oxford.<br />\nThe circumstances connected<br />\nwith this discovery are quite remarkable. A friend of Dr. Powell's, a student at Oxford, while<br />\nengaged in cleaning out the garrett of one of the old buildings<br />\nthere, happened upon an ancient<br />\nale cask, filled, to his disappoint,inent, with papers. Knowing of<br />\nthe researches of our instructor,<br />\nhe shipped the cask, collect, to<br />\nBaltimore as a Christmas present.<br />\nIn going through its contents, Dr.<br />\nPowell found the manuscript in<br />\na bundle with nearly a dozen letters from various ma.gazine editors of that day.<br />\nThe manuscript is of some<br />\nlength. It deals with the romance<br />\nof an Oxford student of the days<br />\nof good Queen Bess, giving an accurate picture of the University<br />\nlife of the period. The brief extract following, written in 'the<br />\nnow famous novelist's most vigorous style, shows that time has<br />\nlittle changed some customs.<br />\n\"Alia, wretch, tlioughtest thou<br />\nit hit me?

Torsch, '21.<br />\nAPRIL 8, 1918<br />\n<br />\nThe Time is Ripe.<br />\nIf there is one non-war problem that the student body of Hopkins<br />\nshould decide this spring it is the question of undergraduate athletics.<br />\nThe pros and cons have thrashed out the issues of this problem for<br />\nmany long years. But, for all those years, the issue was an academic,<br />\ntheoretical, untried issue. Filially, we have been privileged to see the<br />\nday when the undergraduate athletics problem has undergone the acid<br />\ntest of practical experience. When the demand for a vote on the question was made in past years the \"old guard\" of our beneficient and paternal athletic association told us that \"the time had not come,\" that<br />\n\"the scheme is impractical under present conditions.\"<br />\nBut now the time has come\u2014the time for deciding the question of<br />\nundergraduate athletics is here. The athletic record of the present<br />\nyear\u2014the results of which can be fairly judged at the present time\u2014is<br />\nan eloquent and undeniable plea for undergraduate athletics. If ever<br />\nHopkins boasted a successful football season it was last fall\u2014<br />\n\"Charley\" Brickley's team to the contrary notwithstanding. We won<br />\njust one game, it is true; but for the first time we had a football team<br />\nthat battled over every inch of ground, that came out of a game with<br />\ntears streaming down its cheeks, that fought rather for the honor of<br />\nits Alma Mater than for personal amusement or outdoor exercise.<br />\nWhen they won they celebrated a real victory; when they lost they<br />\nfelt the sting of defeat they cared.<br />\nDuring the entire football season last fall six graduate students<br />\nplayed with the team. In any one game there were never any more<br />\nthan three graduates; in many there were less. To each one of those<br />\nmen\u2014Sadler, Sheffey, McKeithen, Hearn, Montgomery and Purcell\u2014<br />\nwe owe sincere gratitude and unstinted praise. They were not begged,<br />\nnot even asked to help the team; they came out of their own accord<br />\nand worked for the positions they won. But we must not allow our appreciation and gratitude to cloud the issue. It was demonstrated last<br />\nfall that Hopkins could turn out an undergraduate team that would<br />\nnot bring discredit to the University. Graduate students have to sacrifice valuable time and important work to engage regularly in athletics.<br />\nThe faculty discourages and disapproves the participation of graduates<br />\nin athletics.<br />\nThe experience of the spring teams bears out our contention. The<br />\nlacrosse team, which boasts the highest standards and the best record<br />\nof any Hopkins team, has not a single graduate student on the squad.<br />\nThe baseball team has in its line-up two graduate students whose positions might without any real detriment be filled by any one of a number of undergraduates; the track team has among its own number two<br />\nfaithful graduates who would gladly be relieved by less busy undergraduates.<br />\nIf we are going to continue athletics in war times when every institution must stand the test of necessity, let us adopt a system of athletics by which the greatest number, the youngest, the least developed<br />\nstudents are attracted to the several branches of athletics. In these<br />\ntimes the physique of every individual college man\u2014not the size of<br />\ngate receipts\u2014is the measure of the success of an athletic system.<br />\nNow is the time for Hopkins to shed its antiquated, inefficient, halfway athletic policy, and to adopt an athletic policy that will at one<br />\ntime serve the best interests of the country and those of the University.<br />\nThe time is ripe for the undergraduate student body to rise up and<br />\ndemand its long-desired, but inherent right\u2014undergraduate athletics.<br />\nThe negative, lackadaisical method of this year only served to bring<br />\nout the real value and the absolute necessity for a positive, aggressively rigid system of undergraduate athletics. If the General Athletic<br />\n<br />\nA Hopkins Tradition in Danger.<br />\nHopkins is proud of its scholastic ideals and achievements; Hopkins<br />\nis proud of the great men that have taught and those that have learned<br />\nwithin its walls; so is Hopkins proud of the lacrosse teams that have<br />\nrepresented it on the athletic field. In lacrosse, a game of science,<br />\nskill and endurance, Hopkins has always excelled. Lacrosse trophies<br />\nand championships come to Hopkins as regularly as commencement<br />\n(lays. Harvard and Yale may have had their football, track or crew<br />\nchampionships; Hopkins has had even more regularly its lacrosse<br />\nchampionship.<br />\nIt was therefore with no cursory feeling of regret, but with a deep,<br />\nprofound feeling of loss, that every Hopkins man saw the Varsity for<br />\nthe first time in many years, suffer an overwhelming\u2014but by no<br />\nmeans, a disgraceful defeat. We can readily persuade ourselves that the<br />\nAlumni team was without exaggeration a \"world-beater\"; we cannot<br />\nso easily satisfy ourselves that any Hopkins lacrosse team should be<br />\ndefeated. If we could make ourselves believe that the Varsity was representative of the University\u2014the best team possible\u2014we would hardly<br />\nfind therein consolation. If we know that the Varsity was not representative of the University we will find ourselves alone to blame.<br />\nAll athletic teams have had to face discouraging conditions this<br />\nyear; difficult as it is for us to believe it, the lacrosse team is no exception. Almost every experienced man has been lost to the team, and<br />\nnew men have had to be drilled to replace experienced regulars.<br />\nAgainst this, there could be no complaint. Against the limited time<br />\nfor practice on account of military training there is no complaint. But<br />\nagainst the size of the squad, which is too small to permit regular practhere is a just complaint. A team cannot practice satisfactice<br />\nwithout a scrub team, without other than imaginary opposition.<br />\ngames,<br />\ntorily<br />\nSurely there are enough loyal Hopkins men left at the University, who<br />\nare willing to sacrifice two or three afternoons a week in order to form<br />\na line-up that will give the 1918 lacrosse champions-to-be some active<br />\ncompetition.<br />\nHats Off to the Class of 1921!<br />\nThe unprecedented responsibilities that have been placed upon this<br />\nyear's freshman class have only served to bring out its best and utmost<br />\nefforts. It has measured up to the task that a freshman class must<br />\nface in war times in a manner that will be a lasting credit to its name.<br />\nThe acceptance of the challenge of St. John's to a debate and the work<br />\nof the freshman battery in the last two ball games are noteworthy<br />\nevents in the undergraduate history of Hopkins. The Class of 1921,<br />\nwhich was placed in the extraordinary position of having to fill the<br />\nvacancies in student activities left by seniors and juniors, has acquitted<br />\nitself with no little honor.<br />\nSECOND AVIATION SCHOOL OPENS<br />\n<br />\nIn the course of the last week,<br />\nthe second Aviation School for<br />\nthe purpose of training men for<br />\nthe \"ground schools\" has been<br />\nopened at the University. The<br />\ncourse has been restricted to men<br />\nwho have been accepted by the examining board for the aviation<br />\nservice, and numbers about twenty-five men.<br />\nClasses are held every evening<br />\nin the large lecture hall and in the<br />\nlaboratory of the Mechanical Engineering Building from 7.30 until<br />\n10. Courses are given in wireless,<br />\ncode practice, gas engines, meterology, theory of flight and military<br />\ntactics.<br />\nThe purpose of the course is to<br />\nprepare men who have enlisted<br />\nbut have not yet been called into<br />\nactive service, for the rigorous<br />\nwork of the ground school. It<br />\nis said that from 35 to 40 per<br />\ncent. of the men who enter the<br />\nground school fail to pass the examinations and are dropped from<br />\nThe preliminary<br />\n\u2022 the service.<br />\n<br />\ntraining in the Aviation School at<br />\nHopkins is offered in order that<br />\nthe flying cadets may be better<br />\nprepared for the work at the<br />\nground school.<br />\nThe first course, which ended<br />\nin March and which was attended<br />\nby almost 60 enlisted men was adistinct success. It was for that<br />\nreason that the Government asked<br />\nthe University to repeat the course<br />\nto which it has sent enlisted men<br />\nfrom neighboring cities.<br />\nThe members of the faculty who<br />\nlecture in the Aviation School are<br />\nDr. W.

PrivateW.T.Tibbets,a<br />\nmember of this patrol, has consented to the publication of the<br />\nfollowing account of the raid:<br />\n\"Corporal Sickel, Privates Littman and Welliver and I got in<br />\nthe express wagon on York road<br />\nand covered up with the bedding<br />\nwhich was in the wagon, the other<br />\nthree lying lengthwise in the wagon and I lying across the back.<br />\nWhen the wagon reached the Hopkins Bowl, the guard stopped it,<br />\nlooked in and jammed the butt of<br />\nhis rifle into the bedding to see if<br />\nit Avas all right; then he let us<br />\npass. The first time the rifle hit \u2022<br />\nme on the knee, and the second<br />\ntime in the stomach.<br />\n\"'Wlwit we reached the Gilman<br />\nHall tunnel, we entered unobserved by way of the postoffice,<br />\nand went around to the rear of<br />\nthe building. Here Corporal Sickel left a paper bomb, on which it<br />\nwas stated that the bomb would<br />\ngo off at 3.45 P. M. It was then<br />\n3.40; that gave us five minutes to<br />\nget out of the building.<br />\n\"Then we went into the washroom by Dr. Hulburt's office,<br />\njumped out the window, tore off<br />\nthe tunnel covering and got into<br />\ntile tunnel. It was pitch dark;<br />\nand, as I was somewhat familiar<br />\nwith the tunnel, I led the way.<br />\nWhen we turned into the tunnel<br />\nconnecting the Civil Engineering and Mechanical Engineering<br />\nBuildings, I saw a faint light coiling from the cellar of the Civil<br />\nEngineering Building.<br />\n\"When we had nearly reached<br />\nit, we heard steps; and, on peeping around the corner, we saw two<br />\nmen of the 'Brown' army approaching. They must live heard<br />\nus, for they turned the lights out<br />\nand waited. But we out-waited<br />\nthem; and in a few minutes the<br />\nlights went on and they advanced.<br />\nWe captured ;hem, Corporal Sickel placing Littman and me as<br />\nguards over them while he placed<br />\na bomb in the Civil Engineering<br />\nBuilding.<br />\n\"The two prisoners were Sergeant Townsend and Private Jammer. Suddenly, Townsend made<br />\na leap at me, and I pulled the<br />\ntrigger; and while I was cocking<br />\nmy rifle, he grabbed it and we<br />\nhad a tussel. Jammer also jumped<br />\non me; but Littman shot him<br />\ntwice, and then shot Townsend<br />\ntwice. Just then the light went<br />\n<br />\nout; and Littman and I ran down<br />\nthe tunnel.<br />\n\"When we.reached the Mechanical Engineering Building, Littman went on to the powerhouse,<br />\nwhile I prepared a bomb for the<br />\nformer. Just as I was about to<br />\nplant my bomb, I looked up and<br />\nsaw a figure between me and the<br />\nlight. I knew he could not see<br />\nme; so I waited for him to go.<br />\nSince I had lost my gun in the<br />\nfight in the tunnel, I was in a<br />\ntight place; but I grew tired of<br />\nwaiting, and decided to bluff this<br />\nguard. So I called out:<br />\n\"'Say! I've had a bead on you<br />\nand could have plugged you for<br />\nthe last ten minutes. You, can't<br />\nsee me, though. Now, put down<br />\nyour gun and walk up to the other<br />\nend of the building!'<br />\n\"He did as I directed; and I<br />\ncrept out and followed the tunnel to the manhole near the Hopkins Club, where I waited until<br />\nthe building was taken by Lieutenant Eby, then I blew it up and<br />\nlater joined my company.\" ,<br />\n<br />\nIn one of the most interesting<br />\nand closest games of the season<br />\nthe Black and Blue basebalt team<br />\nwas defeated by the Western<br />\nMaryland nine by the score of 3<br />\nto 2.

With<br />\nthe exception of publishing a few<br />\nunnecessary statements regarding<br />\nthe\"black list,\"the Student Council has accomplished little that is<br />\nknown to the University. Article<br />\nIV, Section 3 of the constitution<br />\nof the Student Council reads:<br />\n\"Any proceedings necessary for<br />\nthe complete maintenance of the<br />\nUniversity honor system may be<br />\ninstigated by either the faculty,<br />\nthe student body or the Couricil<br />\nitself.\" It is impractical for the<br />\nstudent body, unwieldly as it is, to<br />\ntake up such a matter. The faculty, in some cases, seems to have<br />\nresorted to the method of policing<br />\nthe class room, a very unsatisfactory plan.<br />\nIt therefore remains for the<br />\nStudent Council, if it is to justify<br />\nits existence at all, not merely \"to<br />\nact as a guardian of the honor<br />\nsystem\"; but to state definitely<br />\nwhat it means by \"instigating<br />\nproceedings necessary for the complete maintenance of the University honor system\" and to do<br />\nsomething.

Thompson was<br />\ncaptain of last year's Company A<br />\nand \"Bill\" Skinner was battalion<br />\nadjutant in the pre-war days.<br />\nThe staff marched by, inspecting both ranks, and then the battalion passed in review before the<br />\nPresident, Major Guild and the<br />\ncommissioned instructors. The<br />\ndetailed inspection of every man<br />\nfollowed. One staff officer inspected each company, and as he<br />\nwent down both ranks, examined<br />\nevery embryo officer from head to<br />\nfoot and saw that his rifle was<br />\nspotless. A veritable gale was<br />\nblowing directly in the faces of<br />\nthe men, but all stood at attention, bracing themselves as best<br />\nthey could against the onslaughts<br />\nof the wind. Several campaign<br />\nhats were seen hurtling through<br />\nthe air, with a \"file closer\" following speedily in their wake.<br />\nAfter the company commanders<br />\nhad written down the breaches of<br />\ninspection discipline, and the roll<br />\nhad been called for muster, the<br />\nrest of the evening was devoted<br />\nto open order or skirmish drill.<br />\nFirst this was carried out,by platoons, and later by the company.<br /><br />\nMaryland's Most<br /><br />\nA tactical walk was taken the<br />\nFamous Dishes<br />\nfollowing afternoon by the class<br />\nin practical military engineering.<br />\nMajor Guild and Captain Konze<br />\nTerrapin, Smithaccompanied the class and outfield Ham and<br />\nlined the problem, which was to<br />\nGame<br />\nestablish a line of outguards for<br />\na company over a bit of country<br />\nextending several hundred yards<br />\ndue south of Gilman Hall.

Torsch, '21.<br />\nAPRIL 8, 1918<br /><br />\nThe Time is Ripe.<br />\nIf there is one non-war problem that the student body of Hopkins<br />\nshould decide this spring it is the question of undergraduate athletics.<br />\nThe pros and cons have thrashed out the issues of this problem for<br />\nmany long years. But, for all those years, the issue was an academic,<br />\ntheoretical, untried issue. Filially, we have been privileged to see the<br />\nday when the undergraduate athletics problem has undergone the acid<br />\ntest of practical experience. When the demand for a vote on the question was made in past years the \"old guard\" of our beneficient and paternal athletic association told us that \"the time had not come,\" that<br />\n\"the scheme is impractical under present conditions.\"<br />\nBut now the time has come\u2014the time for deciding the question of<br />\nundergraduate athletics is here. The athletic record of the present<br />\nyear\u2014the results of which can be fairly judged at the present time\u2014is<br />\nan eloquent and undeniable plea for undergraduate athletics. If ever<br />\nHopkins boasted a successful football season it was last fall\u2014<br />\n\"Charley\" Brickley's team to the contrary notwithstanding. We won<br />\njust one game, it is true; but for the first time we had a football team<br />\nthat battled over every inch of ground, that came out of a game with<br />\ntears streaming down its cheeks, that fought rather for the honor of<br />\nits Alma Mater than for personal amusement or outdoor exercise.<br />\nWhen they won they celebrated a real victory; when they lost they<br />\nfelt the sting of defeat they cared.<br />\nDuring the entire football season last fall six graduate students<br />\nplayed with the team. In any one game there were never any more<br />\nthan three graduates; in many there were less. To each one of those<br />\nmen\u2014Sadler, Sheffey, McKeithen, Hearn, Montgomery and Purcell\u2014<br />\nwe owe sincere gratitude and unstinted praise. They were not begged,<br />\nnot even asked to help the team; they came out of their own accord<br />\nand worked for the positions they won. But we must not allow our appreciation and gratitude to cloud the issue. It was demonstrated last<br />\nfall that Hopkins could turn out an undergraduate team that would<br />\nnot bring discredit to the University. Graduate students have to sacrifice valuable time and important work to engage regularly in athletics.<br />\nThe faculty discourages and disapproves the participation of graduates<br />\nin athletics.<br />\nThe experience of the spring teams bears out our contention. The<br />\nlacrosse team, which boasts the highest standards and the best record<br />\nof any Hopkins team, has not a single graduate student on the squad.<br />\nThe baseball team has in its line-up two graduate students whose positions might without any real detriment be filled by any one of a number of undergraduates; the track team has among its own number two<br />\nfaithful graduates who would gladly be relieved by less busy undergraduates.<br />\nIf we are going to continue athletics in war times when every institution must stand the test of necessity, let us adopt a system of athletics by which the greatest number, the youngest, the least developed<br />\nstudents are attracted to the several branches of athletics. In these<br />\ntimes the physique of every individual college man\u2014not the size of<br />\ngate receipts\u2014is the measure of the success of an athletic system.<br />\nNow is the time for Hopkins to shed its antiquated, inefficient, halfway athletic policy, and to adopt an athletic policy that will at one<br />\ntime serve the best interests of the country and those of the University.<br />\nThe time is ripe for the undergraduate student body to rise up and<br />\ndemand its long-desired, but inherent right\u2014undergraduate athletics.<br />\nThe negative, lackadaisical method of this year only served to bring<br />\nout the real value and the absolute necessity for a positive, aggressively rigid system of undergraduate athletics. If the General Athletic<br /><br />\nA Hopkins Tradition in Danger.<br />\nHopkins is proud of its scholastic ideals and achievements; Hopkins<br />\nis proud of the great men that have taught and those that have learned<br />\nwithin its walls; so is Hopkins proud of the lacrosse teams that have<br />\nrepresented it on the athletic field. In lacrosse, a game of science,<br />\nskill and endurance, Hopkins has always excelled. Lacrosse trophies<br />\nand championships come to Hopkins as regularly as commencement<br />\n(lays. Harvard and Yale may have had their football, track or crew<br />\nchampionships; Hopkins has had even more regularly its lacrosse<br />\nchampionship.<br />\nIt was therefore with no cursory feeling of regret, but with a deep,<br />\nprofound feeling of loss, that every Hopkins man saw the Varsity for<br />\nthe first time in many years, suffer an overwhelming\u2014but by no<br />\nmeans, a disgraceful defeat. We can readily persuade ourselves that the<br />\nAlumni team was without exaggeration a \"world-beater\"; we cannot<br />\nso easily satisfy ourselves that any Hopkins lacrosse team should be<br />\ndefeated. If we could make ourselves believe that the Varsity was representative of the University\u2014the best team possible\u2014we would hardly<br />\nfind therein consolation. If we know that the Varsity was not representative of the University we will find ourselves alone to blame.<br />\nAll athletic teams have had to face discouraging conditions this<br />\nyear; difficult as it is for us to believe it, the lacrosse team is no exception. Almost every experienced man has been lost to the team, and<br />\nnew men have had to be drilled to replace experienced regulars.<br />\nAgainst this, there could be no complaint. Against the limited time<br />\nfor practice on account of military training there is no complaint. But<br />\nagainst the size of the squad, which is too small to permit regular practhere is a just complaint. A team cannot practice satisfactice<br />\nwithout a scrub team, without other than imaginary opposition.<br />\ngames,<br />\ntorily<br />\nSurely there are enough loyal Hopkins men left at the University, who<br />\nare willing to sacrifice two or three afternoons a week in order to form<br />\na line-up that will give the 1918 lacrosse champions-to-be some active<br />\ncompetition.<br />\nHats Off to the Class of 1921!<br />\nThe unprecedented responsibilities that have been placed upon this<br />\nyear's freshman class have only served to bring out its best and utmost<br />\nefforts. It has measured up to the task that a freshman class must<br />\nface in war times in a manner that will be a lasting credit to its name.<br />\nThe acceptance of the challenge of St. John's to a debate and the work<br />\nof the freshman battery in the last two ball games are noteworthy<br />\nevents in the undergraduate history of Hopkins. The Class of 1921,<br />\nwhich was placed in the extraordinary position of having to fill the<br />\nvacancies in student activities left by seniors and juniors, has acquitted<br />\nitself with no little honor.<br />\nSECOND AVIATION SCHOOL OPENS<br /><br />\nIn the course of the last week,<br />\nthe second Aviation School for<br />\nthe purpose of training men for<br />\nthe \"ground schools\" has been<br />\nopened at the University. The<br />\ncourse has been restricted to men<br />\nwho have been accepted by the examining board for the aviation<br />\nservice, and numbers about twenty-five men.<br />\nClasses are held every evening<br />\nin the large lecture hall and in the<br />\nlaboratory of the Mechanical Engineering Building from 7.30 until<br />\n10. Courses are given in wireless,<br />\ncode practice, gas engines, meterology, theory of flight and military<br />\ntactics.<br />\nThe purpose of the course is to<br />\nprepare men who have enlisted<br />\nbut have not yet been called into<br />\nactive service, for the rigorous<br />\nwork of the ground school. It<br />\nis said that from 35 to 40 per<br />\ncent. of the men who enter the<br />\nground school fail to pass the examinations and are dropped from<br />\nThe preliminary<br />\n\u2022 the service.<br /><br />\ntraining in the Aviation School at<br />\nHopkins is offered in order that<br />\nthe flying cadets may be better<br />\nprepared for the work at the<br />\nground school.<br />\nThe first course, which ended<br />\nin March and which was attended<br />\nby almost 60 enlisted men was adistinct success. It was for that<br />\nreason that the Government asked<br />\nthe University to repeat the course<br />\nto which it has sent enlisted men<br />\nfrom neighboring cities.<br />\nThe members of the faculty who<br />\nlecture in the Aviation School are<br />\nDr. W.

Canton have already left for the Signal Corps<br />\ncamp at College Park, Md.<br />\nHarris is a senior in the mechanical engineering department of<br />\nthe Technical School. He enlisted<br />\nas a private in the Hopkins Battalion in the fall of 1916 and<br />\nworked his way up to a captaincy<br />\nat the beginning of this collegiate<br />\nyear. He took his examination for<br />\na commission almost a month ago,<br />\nand was recently notified that he<br />\nhad passed.<br />\nH. M. Ewald, G. M. Hall and E.<br />\nJ.

They will go to<br />\nCollege Park, where they expect to<br />\nbe placed in an Officers' Training<br />\nCamp,and eventually to get a commission. With the training they<br />\nhave already received, they should<br />\nhave no trouble in accomplishing<br />\ntheir purpose.<br />\nEwald and Canton are seniors<br />\nin the Engineering School, while<br />\nHall, who received his A.

Hall has been affiliated<br />\nwith the musical clubs for a number of years.<br /><br />\nThe Black and Blue baseball<br />\nteam suffered its first defeat of<br />\nthe season last Tuesday, when it<br />\nmet the crack Holy Cross nine.<br />\nAlthough the final score was 13<br />\nto 1, the game was far more interesting than the result indicates. The game at times was<br />\nmarked by sensational fielding on<br />\nthe part of both teams.<br />\nWelliver, a freshman, who was<br />\non the mound for Hopkins, pitched<br />\na creditable game. This was his<br />\nfirst game of college ball and he<br />\nshowed that he had the makings<br />\nof a dependable pitcher. Rodgers, who caught for the Black<br />\nand Blue nine, also showed up<br />\nwell, considering his lack of experience. He generally plays an<br />\noutfield position, but due to the<br />\nabsence of Captain Benson and<br />\nthe injury of Evans, Benson's understudy, was shifted to the receiving end of the battery. De<br />\nMarco, played third base in the<br />\nplace of Cox. Purcell scored<br />\nHopkins only tally in the third inning. The score:<br /><br />\nIn the destruction of the buildings at Homewood of the Johns<br />\nHopkins University on March 27<br />\nmuch of the credit for the success<br />\nof the \"White\" army is due the<br />\nraiding patrol, which bombed the<br />\nbuildings. PrivateW.T.Tibbets,a<br />\nmember of this patrol, has consented to the publication of the<br />\nfollowing account of the raid:<br />\n\"Corporal Sickel, Privates Littman and Welliver and I got in<br />\nthe express wagon on York road<br />\nand covered up with the bedding<br />\nwhich was in the wagon, the other<br />\nthree lying lengthwise in the wagon and I lying across the back.<br />\nWhen the wagon reached the Hopkins Bowl, the guard stopped it,<br />\nlooked in and jammed the butt of<br />\nhis rifle into the bedding to see if<br />\nit Avas all right; then he let us<br />\npass. The first time the rifle hit \u2022<br />\nme on the knee, and the second<br />\ntime in the stomach.<br />\n\"'Wlwit we reached the Gilman<br />\nHall tunnel, we entered unobserved by way of the postoffice,<br />\nand went around to the rear of<br />\nthe building. Here Corporal Sickel left a paper bomb, on which it<br />\nwas stated that the bomb would<br />\ngo off at 3.45 P. M. It was then<br />\n3.40; that gave us five minutes to<br />\nget out of the building.<br />\n\"Then we went into the washroom by Dr. Hulburt's office,<br />\njumped out the window, tore off<br />\nthe tunnel covering and got into<br />\ntile tunnel. It was pitch dark;<br />\nand, as I was somewhat familiar<br />\nwith the tunnel, I led the way.<br />\nWhen we turned into the tunnel<br />\nconnecting the Civil Engineering and Mechanical Engineering<br />\nBuildings, I saw a faint light coiling from the cellar of the Civil<br />\nEngineering Building.<br />\n\"When we had nearly reached<br />\nit, we heard steps; and, on peeping around the corner, we saw two<br />\nmen of the 'Brown' army approaching. They must live heard<br />\nus, for they turned the lights out<br />\nand waited. But we out-waited<br />\nthem; and in a few minutes the<br />\nlights went on and they advanced.<br />\nWe captured ;hem, Corporal Sickel placing Littman and me as<br />\nguards over them while he placed<br />\na bomb in the Civil Engineering<br />\nBuilding.<br />\n\"The two prisoners were Sergeant Townsend and Private Jammer. Suddenly, Townsend made<br />\na leap at me, and I pulled the<br />\ntrigger; and while I was cocking<br />\nmy rifle, he grabbed it and we<br />\nhad a tussel. Jammer also jumped<br />\non me; but Littman shot him<br />\ntwice, and then shot Townsend<br />\ntwice. Just then the light went<br /><br />\nout; and Littman and I ran down<br />\nthe tunnel.<br />\n\"When we.reached the Mechanical Engineering Building, Littman went on to the powerhouse,<br />\nwhile I prepared a bomb for the<br />\nformer. Just as I was about to<br />\nplant my bomb, I looked up and<br />\nsaw a figure between me and the<br />\nlight. I knew he could not see<br />\nme; so I waited for him to go.<br />\nSince I had lost my gun in the<br />\nfight in the tunnel, I was in a<br />\ntight place; but I grew tired of<br />\nwaiting, and decided to bluff this<br />\nguard. So I called out:<br />\n\"'Say! I've had a bead on you<br />\nand could have plugged you for<br />\nthe last ten minutes. You, can't<br />\nsee me, though. Now, put down<br />\nyour gun and walk up to the other<br />\nend of the building!'<br />\n\"He did as I directed; and I<br />\ncrept out and followed the tunnel to the manhole near the Hopkins Club, where I waited until<br />\nthe building was taken by Lieutenant Eby, then I blew it up and<br />\nlater joined my company.\" ,<br /><br />\nIn one of the most interesting<br />\nand closest games of the season<br />\nthe Black and Blue basebalt team<br />\nwas defeated by the Western<br />\nMaryland nine by the score of 3<br />\nto 2. All of the scoring was done<br />\nin the early stages of the game,<br />\nand after the fourth inning the<br />\ncontest developed into a pitching<br />\nduel between 'Welliver and McNutt.<br />\nWelliver, who replaced Judefind in the second inning, pitched<br />\na great game of ball. He struck<br />\nout six batters and only twice<br />\nwere the Green and Gold players<br />\nable to connect safely with his delivery. The Black and Blue batters were more fortunate and<br />\ngathered four bingles, one of<br />\nwhich was smashed for a circuit<br />\ndrive by Littman.<br />\nDe Marco and Purcell carried<br />\noff the sensational fielding honors<br />\nby each making a double play unassisted, which killed off several<br />\nprospective runs for the upStaters.<br />\nDe Marco scored first for the<br />\nBlack and Blue on consecutive<br />\nHopkins.<br />\ndoubles by himself and Webb.

With<br />\nthe exception of publishing a few<br />\nunnecessary statements regarding<br />\nthe\"black list,\"the Student Council has accomplished little that is<br />\nknown to the University. Article<br />\nIV, Section 3 of the constitution<br />\nof the Student Council reads:<br />\n\"Any proceedings necessary for<br />\nthe complete maintenance of the<br />\nUniversity honor system may be<br />\ninstigated by either the faculty,<br />\nthe student body or the Couricil<br />\nitself.\" It is impractical for the<br />\nstudent body, unwieldly as it is, to<br />\ntake up such a matter. The faculty, in some cases, seems to have<br />\nresorted to the method of policing<br />\nthe class room, a very unsatisfactory plan.<br />\nIt therefore remains for the<br />\nStudent Council, if it is to justify<br />\nits existence at all, not merely \"to<br />\nact as a guardian of the honor<br />\nsystem\"; but to state definitely<br />\nwhat it means by \"instigating<br />\nproceedings necessary for the complete maintenance of the University honor system\" and to do<br />\nsomething.

Five of them are from<br />\nhis Thames set, two from the<br />\nFrench and several from the first<br />\nand second Venetian sets.<br />\nBesides these, there is an original lithotint, \"The Thames,\" and<br />\nan original dry point, \"Te Velvet Dress,\" both printed by Whistler and both superb impressions.<br />\nThe silvery character of the former is especially noteworthy.<br />\nAll of the collection which has<br />\nbeen loaned to the University is<br />\nsnow framed, and is well worth seeing and studying.

It was the first<br />\nlacrosse game that many of the<br />\nmen had ever played, the first time<br />\nthat the majority of the team had<br />\never played together, and the team<br />\nwas greatly weakened by the injury and sickness of several of<br />\nthe regular attack men. Notwithstanding, there is no doubt that<br />\nthe alumni team this year was the<br />\nstrongest in years; most of the<br />\nmen were young and had plenty of<br />\n\"legs.\" It is not likely that the<br />\n'Varsity will run up against any<br />\nstronger team this year than the<br />\nteam they met last week.
